Leader<00:00:49.379> Snoke<00:00:49.500> but<00:00:50.460> it<00:00:50.579> does<00:00:50.820> appear<00:00:51.059> to<00:00:51.300> be<00:00:51.449> an

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
Leader Snoke but it does appear to be an

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.680 
Leader Snoke but it does appear to be an
alternate<00:00:52.170> take<00:00:52.610> he<00:00:53.610> actually<00:00:53.760> appears<00:00:54.390> to<00:00:54.600> be

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
alternate take he actually appears to be

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.810 
alternate take he actually appears to be
a<00:00:54.719> little<00:00:54.960> bit<00:00:55.230> more<00:00:55.500> calm<00:00:55.920> which<00:00:56.640> is

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:56.820 
a little bit more calm which is

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:58.670 
a little bit more calm which is
interesting<00:00:57.329> so<00:00:57.539> go<00:00:57.780> check<00:00:58.020> it<00:00:58.079> out<00:00:58.320> tell<00:00:58.559> me

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680

interesting so go check it out tell me
what<00:00:58.829> you<00:00:58.920> guys<00:00:59.100> think<00:00:59.160> I<00:00:59.670> personally

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
what you guys think I personally

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.660 
what you guys think I personally
preferred<00:01:01.109> the<00:01:01.230> first<00:01:01.530> take<00:01:01.800> maybe<00:01:02.430> that's

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
preferred the first take maybe that's

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.090 
preferred the first take maybe that's
just<00:01:02.940> because<00:01:03.090> it<00:01:03.420> was<00:01:03.449> an<00:01:03.809> HD<00:01:04.320> quality<00:01:04.589> and<00:01:04.860> we

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
just because it was an HD quality and we

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.060 
just because it was an HD quality and we
could<00:01:05.250> hear<00:01:05.519> more<00:01:05.880> clearly<00:01:06.090> but<00:01:07.049> this<00:01:07.500> cake<00:01:07.860> is

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
could hear more clearly but this cake is

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.039 
could hear more clearly but this cake is
good<00:01:08.280> as<00:01:08.400> well<00:01:08.430> I<00:01:08.850> love<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.360> dialogue<00:01:09.810> it's

all<00:01:10.200> still<00:01:10.590> the<00:01:10.710> same<00:01:10.979> but<00:01:11.700> yeah<00:01:12.090> it<00:01:12.150> seems<00:01:12.990> to

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
all still the same but yeah it seems to

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.560 
all still the same but yeah it seems to
be<00:01:13.229> an<00:01:13.380> alternate<00:01:13.799> take<00:01:14.040> so<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.150> first<00:01:15.390> new

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
looking pretty frightened now what I

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.749 
looking pretty frightened now what I
think<00:02:01.079> it<00:02:01.170> is<00:02:01.200> is<00:02:01.560> possibly<00:02:02.189> the<00:02:02.280> rumored

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
think it is is possibly the rumored

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:05.149 
think it is is possibly the rumored
super<00:02:03.180> weapon<00:02:03.570> that<00:02:03.780> the<00:02:04.320> first<00:02:04.619> order<00:02:04.890> may

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
super weapon that the first order may

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:07.760 
super weapon that the first order may
have<00:02:05.460> or<00:02:05.850> even<00:02:06.149> a<00:02:06.329> Star<00:02:06.689> Destroyer<00:02:06.719> or<00:02:07.350> Super

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
have or even a Star Destroyer or Super

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.559 
have or even a Star Destroyer or Super
Star<00:02:07.979> Destroyer<00:02:08.119> because<00:02:09.119> we're<00:02:09.270> not<00:02:09.300> exactly

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
Star Destroyer because we're not exactly

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.780 
Star Destroyer because we're not exactly
sure<00:02:09.929> how<00:02:10.410> long<00:02:10.679> she's<00:02:10.950> been<00:02:10.979> on<00:02:11.160> jock<00:02:11.550> you

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:11.790 
sure how long she's been on jock you

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:13.820 
sure how long she's been on jock you
there<00:02:12.420> might<00:02:12.660> be<00:02:12.690> a<00:02:12.870> whole<00:02:13.260> lot<00:02:13.440> of<00:02:13.470> thing

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
there might be a whole lot of thing

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.320 
there might be a whole lot of thing
that<00:02:13.950> have<00:02:14.070> gone<00:02:14.250> on<00:02:14.310> that<00:02:14.700> she<00:02:14.880> hasn't<00:02:15.090> really

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
that have gone on that she hasn't really

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.450 
that have gone on that she hasn't really
had<00:02:15.810> the<00:02:15.960> opportunity<00:02:15.990> to<00:02:16.530> experience<00:02:17.070> not

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:17.460 
had the opportunity to experience not

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:19.130 
had the opportunity to experience not
all<00:02:17.670> of<00:02:17.820> them<00:02:17.940> good<00:02:18.180> obviously<00:02:18.930> with<00:02:19.110> the

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:19.140 
all of them good obviously with the

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:21.560 
all of them good obviously with the
first<00:02:19.470> order<00:02:19.740> in<00:02:19.980> kylo<00:02:20.340> Ren<00:02:20.550> so<00:02:21.180> I<00:02:21.210> would

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
first order in kylo Ren so I would

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:23.570 
first order in kylo Ren so I would
assume<00:02:21.690> that<00:02:22.230> she's<00:02:22.770> lookin<00:02:23.070> at<00:02:23.190> something

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
assume that she's lookin at something

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.720 
assume that she's lookin at something
pretty<00:02:23.610> big<00:02:24.240> and<00:02:24.570> pretty<00:02:24.630> terrifying<00:02:25.470> my<00:02:26.460> bet

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
pretty big and pretty terrifying my bet

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:28.370 
pretty big and pretty terrifying my bet
would<00:02:26.910> probably<00:02:27.330> be<00:02:27.450> a<00:02:27.480> super<00:02:28.080> star<00:02:28.110> destroyer

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
would probably be a super star destroyer

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:31.160 
would probably be a super star destroyer
the<00:02:29.130> brand<00:02:29.970> new<00:02:30.150> one<00:02:30.300> that<00:02:30.600> the<00:02:30.720> first<00:02:30.960> order

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
the brand new one that the first order

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:33.080 
the brand new one that the first order
have<00:02:31.470> or<00:02:31.770> the<00:02:31.920> brand<00:02:32.130> new<00:02:32.340> version<00:02:32.820> that<00:02:32.970> the

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
have or the brand new version that the

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.690 
have or the brand new version that the
first<00:02:33.330> order<00:02:33.540> has<00:02:34.080> of<00:02:34.440> course<00:02:34.490> constructed<00:02:35.490> or

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
first order has of course constructed or

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.220 
first order has of course constructed or
maybe<00:02:36.360> we<00:02:36.690> see<00:02:36.930> kylo<00:02:37.380> Ren<00:02:37.650> and<00:02:37.920> his<00:02:38.100> spaceship

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:39.230 
maybe we see kylo Ren and his spaceship

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:41.510 
maybe we see kylo Ren and his spaceship
descending<00:02:40.230> down<00:02:40.380> to<00:02:40.560> the<00:02:40.680> planet<00:02:41.070> something

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:41.520 
descending down to the planet something

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.490 
descending down to the planet something
like<00:02:41.670> that<00:02:41.850> something<00:02:42.180> that's<00:02:42.600> not<00:02:42.870> good<00:02:43.200> for

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
like that something that's not good for

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.310 
like that something that's not good for
our<00:02:44.100> characters<00:02:44.850> at<00:02:45.150> least<00:02:45.510> that's<00:02:45.780> what<00:02:46.290> I

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:46.320 
our characters at least that's what I

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:48.560 
our characters at least that's what I
think<00:02:46.710> so<00:02:47.280> yeah<00:02:47.550> that's<00:02:47.730> about<00:02:48.060> all<00:02:48.090> there<00:02:48.510> is

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:48.570 
think so yeah that's about all there is

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:50.480 
think so yeah that's about all there is
to<00:02:48.810> talk<00:02:48.960> about<00:02:49.140> their<00:02:49.470> real<00:02:49.890> quick<00:02:50.130> she<00:02:50.370> is

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:50.490 
to talk about their real quick she is

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:52.070 
to talk about their real quick she is
still<00:02:50.760> wearing<00:02:51.000> the<00:02:51.210> same<00:02:51.390> get<00:02:51.600> up<00:02:51.750> that<00:02:51.959> we

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:52.080 
still wearing the same get up that we

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.470 
still wearing the same get up that we
saw<00:02:52.290> her<00:02:52.500> wearing<00:02:52.770> on<00:02:53.040> jakku<00:02:53.580> which<00:02:54.209> means

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:54.480 
saw her wearing on jakku which means

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.040 
saw her wearing on jakku which means
that<00:02:54.720> this<00:02:54.870> should<00:02:55.290> take<00:02:56.250> place<00:02:56.840> somewhere<00:02:57.840> in

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
that this should take place somewhere in

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.050 
that this should take place somewhere in
the<00:02:58.140> second<00:02:58.530> act<00:02:58.680> of<00:02:58.890> the<00:02:58.950> movie<00:02:59.310> if<00:02:59.610> we<00:02:59.880> all

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
the second act of the movie if we all

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.000 
the second act of the movie if we all
assume<00:03:00.360> did<00:03:00.810> the<00:03:00.990> first<00:03:01.200> act<00:03:01.440> will<00:03:01.650> take<00:03:01.860> place

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
assume did the first act will take place

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.340 
assume did the first act will take place
on<00:03:02.220> jakku<00:03:02.700> and<00:03:02.910> the<00:03:03.420> third<00:03:03.660> act<00:03:03.900> will<00:03:04.140> take

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 
on jakku and the third act will take

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:07.910 
on jakku and the third act will take
place<00:03:04.530> on<00:03:04.830> this<00:03:05.610> planet<00:03:05.959> that<00:03:06.959> we<00:03:07.170> see<00:03:07.380> in<00:03:07.410> fact

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
place on this planet that we see in fact

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.330 
place on this planet that we see in fact
later<00:03:08.310> on<00:03:08.430> in<00:03:08.850> this<00:03:09.090> very<00:03:10.020> teaser<00:03:10.380> but<00:03:11.190> the

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
later on in this very teaser but the

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.270 
later on in this very teaser but the
second<00:03:11.700> act<00:03:11.820> will<00:03:12.240> take<00:03:12.420> place<00:03:12.600> more<00:03:12.930> here<00:03:13.350> and

00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:14.280 
second act will take place more here and

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:16.100 
second act will take place more here and
then<00:03:14.490> of<00:03:14.670> course<00:03:14.700> I<00:03:15.090> assume<00:03:15.570> it's<00:03:15.780> the<00:03:15.870> same

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:16.110 
then of course I assume it's the same

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:17.810 
then of course I assume it's the same
planet<00:03:16.410> where<00:03:16.709> we<00:03:16.860> saw<00:03:17.040> the<00:03:17.100> lakes<00:03:17.459> and<00:03:17.730> all

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
planet where we saw the lakes and all

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:20.150 
planet where we saw the lakes and all
the<00:03:17.970> x-wings<00:03:18.420> and<00:03:18.690> Poe<00:03:19.230> Dameron<00:03:19.739> so<00:03:19.980> that's

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
the x-wings and Poe Dameron so that's

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.460 
the x-wings and Poe Dameron so that's
just<00:03:20.280> speculation<00:03:20.810> but<00:03:21.810> that's<00:03:21.989> kind<00:03:22.230> of<00:03:22.260> what

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
just speculation but that's kind of what

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.620 
just speculation but that's kind of what
I<00:03:22.500> think<00:03:22.590> is<00:03:22.920> going<00:03:22.980> to<00:03:23.250> happen<00:03:23.310> so<00:03:24.090> moving<00:03:24.480> on

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
I think is going to happen so moving on

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:26.390 
I think is going to happen so moving on
to<00:03:24.810> the<00:03:24.959> big<00:03:25.140> shot<00:03:25.410> of<00:03:25.440> the<00:03:25.709> trailer<00:03:26.100> the<00:03:26.280> one

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
to the big shot of the trailer the one

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.360 
to the big shot of the trailer the one
everyone<00:03:26.820> is<00:03:26.940> talking<00:03:27.180> about<00:03:27.420> and<00:03:28.040> the<00:03:29.040> shot

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
everyone is talking about and the shot

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:32.150 
everyone is talking about and the shot
that<00:03:30.030> just<00:03:30.300> made<00:03:30.510> everybody<00:03:31.140> just<00:03:31.470> go<00:03:31.680> insane
