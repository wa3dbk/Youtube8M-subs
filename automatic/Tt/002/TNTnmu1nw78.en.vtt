step<00:00:24.769> 1<00:00:25.279> good<00:00:25.759> job<00:00:28.810> now<00:00:29.810> the<00:00:29.869> gel<00:00:30.289> is<00:00:30.560> a

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:30.619 
step 1 good job now the gel is a

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:32.619 
step 1 good job now the gel is a
chemical<00:00:31.070> absorbent<00:00:31.699> called<00:00:32.090> sodium

you need to do is pour some water onto a

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:51.520 
you need to do is pour some water onto a

be will see some fluffy white stuff
that's<00:00:55.129> the<00:00:55.369> crystals<00:00:55.760> i<00:00:56.680> use<00:00:57.680> some<00:00:57.979> babies<00:00:58.400> i

00:00:58.539 --> 00:00:58.549 
that's the crystals i use some babies i

00:00:58.549 --> 00:01:02.619 
that's the crystals i use some babies i
slightly<00:00:58.820> rounded<00:00:59.890> i<00:01:01.030> can<00:01:02.030> put<00:01:02.269> all<00:01:02.570> your

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:02.629 
slightly rounded i can put all your

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:05.109 
slightly rounded i can put all your
crystals<00:01:03.350> into<00:01:03.680> small<00:01:04.189> pot<00:01:04.489> for<00:01:04.729> measuring

00:01:05.109 --> 00:01:05.119 
crystals into small pot for measuring

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:07.899 
crystals into small pot for measuring
your<00:01:05.210> meter<00:01:05.530> it's<00:01:06.530> a<00:01:06.830> lot<00:01:07.310> cleaner<00:01:07.520> that<00:01:07.759> way

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:07.909 
your meter it's a lot cleaner that way

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:11.590 
your meter it's a lot cleaner that way
anyway<00:01:09.159> now<00:01:10.159> you<00:01:10.220> can<00:01:10.430> just<00:01:10.580> dump<00:01:10.909> it<00:01:11.060> onto<00:01:11.270> the

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:11.600 
anyway now you can just dump it onto the

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.060 
anyway now you can just dump it onto the
bigger<00:01:11.810> pot<00:01:12.110> you're<00:01:12.259> gonna<00:01:12.380> mix<00:01:12.619> stuff<00:01:12.890> in

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.070 
bigger pot you're gonna mix stuff in

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:22.270 
bigger pot you're gonna mix stuff in
later<00:01:17.500> step<00:01:18.500> to<00:01:18.829> the<00:01:19.460> soil<00:01:20.800> this<00:01:21.800> part<00:01:22.130> is

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 
later step to the soil this part is

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.160 
later step to the soil this part is
really<00:01:22.490> easy<00:01:22.610> just<00:01:23.240> measure<00:01:23.480> the<00:01:23.690> same<00:01:23.870> amount

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:24.170 
really easy just measure the same amount

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.320 
really easy just measure the same amount
of<00:01:24.260> soil<00:01:24.560> add<00:01:24.950> it<00:01:25.250> to<00:01:25.430> your<00:01:25.490> gel<00:01:25.760> and<00:01:26.000> mix

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:26.330 
of soil add it to your gel and mix

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.980 
of soil add it to your gel and mix
similarly<00:01:26.840> i<00:01:28.210> put<00:01:29.210> this<00:01:29.330> all<00:01:29.570> into<00:01:29.750> the<00:01:29.930> same

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:29.990 
similarly i put this all into the same

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.170 
similarly i put this all into the same
pot<00:01:30.409> as<00:01:30.620> the<00:01:30.650> crystals<00:01:31.220> to<00:01:31.550> make<00:01:31.580> sure<00:01:31.970> it's

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:32.180 
pot as the crystals to make sure it's

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:36.280 
pot as the crystals to make sure it's
roughly<00:01:33.050> the<00:01:33.140> same<00:01:33.380> amount<00:01:34.510> yeah<00:01:35.510> you<00:01:35.570> do<00:01:36.050> move

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:36.290 
roughly the same amount yeah you do move

00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:37.840 
roughly the same amount yeah you do move
that<00:01:36.590> by<00:01:36.800> the<00:01:36.860> way

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:37.850 
that by the way

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.200 
that by the way
just<00:01:38.510> dump<00:01:38.810> it<00:01:38.900> all<00:01:39.080> in<00:01:39.439> and<00:01:40.009> mix<00:01:40.640> it<00:01:40.759> all<00:01:40.850> for

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.210 
just dump it all in and mix it all for

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.410 
just dump it all in and mix it all for
me<00:01:41.390> to<00:01:41.659> make<00:01:41.869> a<00:01:42.110> super<00:01:42.650> soft<00:01:43.009> fluffy<00:01:43.759> and<00:01:44.150> most

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
me to make a super soft fluffy and most

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:50.500 
me to make a super soft fluffy and most
soil<00:01:46.150> pops<00:01:47.150> into<00:01:48.049> the

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:50.510 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:56.050 

we<00:01:50.900> need<00:01:51.110> a<00:01:51.140> soil<00:01:51.700> flowerpot<00:01:52.700> and<00:01:54.820> now<00:01:55.820> you<00:01:55.880> can

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:56.060 
we need a soil flowerpot and now you can

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.300 
we need a soil flowerpot and now you can
start<00:01:56.300> packing<00:01:56.510> the<00:01:56.810> soil<00:01:57.080> into<00:01:57.470> the<00:01:57.500> pot<00:01:57.860> and

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
start packing the soil into the pot and

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.360 
start packing the soil into the pot and
then<00:01:58.690> come<00:01:59.690> to<00:01:59.840> start<00:02:00.200> merging<00:02:00.500> apartments

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:01.370 
then come to start merging apartments

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:03.940 
then come to start merging apartments
and<00:02:01.520> really<00:02:02.000> comfy<00:02:02.510> and<00:02:02.780> you<00:02:03.470> can<00:02:03.620> also<00:02:03.740> do
