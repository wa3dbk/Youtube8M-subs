00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.129
 It will be disgusting if it is not the application method on the 29th 

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:05.180
 71 years old 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:09.689
 It is not the same, but frb is cheap and I also fail 

00:00:09.689 --> 00:00:11.239
 Already 

00:00:11.239 --> 00:00:15.730
 It is by such a flow to let you say that stock depreciation and dollar depreciation 

00:00:15.729 --> 00:00:20.610
 It is a high-class inn 10,000 yen salary with holding what I said generally 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:23.349
 cut 

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:25.720
 weight 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:27.460
 Various things 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.079
 It is decided by oneself 

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:33.079
 The result is an overheated economy 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:38.100
 What is the reason for displaying public servants 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:43.030
 It's because Yokoi is breaking up, so just turning it into a Buddhist 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:44.320
 Not 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.320
 After all I think that injection is good 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:50.980
 Hearts are all tons 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.480
 I received this and rushed 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:57.840
 To grasp 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.850
 From now on, it will only have been compared with the actual example year 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:06.970
 And only two of them 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:09.440
 Colts open 4 consecutive wins 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:10.340
 2227 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.780
 It shows 13:30 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.200
 It was also said that it was decided by the spray sand crow which is not a Japanese painting 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.670
 It is called 

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:21.770
 Revival 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.170
 I made the best feeling-and- 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.460
 Then when I discovered 

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:35.579
 Let's add to the present 

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:36.970
 Said 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:42.460
 I think that there is from mac and numeric keys and cursor Nakasu Nishi 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.560
 The stock was bought out on the 24th 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:47.640
 I will 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:48.670
 Bamboo lantern 

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:53.700
 It is the situation that does not have that support in the spring of 2 sheets 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.480
 Matsuyama was bad 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.640
 Adjust the weight and weight above the phone number 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:11.320
 The story is a bit tired but the clerk is overtaken 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:12.419
 Naito 

00:02:12.419 --> 00:02:13.789
 Pop pop 

00:02:13.789 --> 00:02:16.789
 The successor clerk is puffy 

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:19.589
 All 

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:21.309
 Wild 

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:23.810
 Former director selling in that shop 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.449
 First place in seventh place 

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:29.959
 Though it is great, it is puffy in Takahachiba 

00:02:30.899 --> 00:02:33.880
 Minister who does not want to be 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:37.130
 In response to a certain national response 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:38.149
 hand 

00:02:38.149 --> 00:02:39.299
 that 

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:43.049
 Not actively done with body and adhesive 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:47.519
 That is 8 but I do not use it, but the weight of the SFC is high 

00:02:48.339 --> 00:02:51.339
 Put in the picture and take out the gun 

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:54.369
 I also consider the goal 

00:02:54.369 --> 00:02:57.619
 That's good 

00:02:57.619 --> 00:03:00.159
 Cd that song 

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:03.159
 Welcome and pointed out 

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:10.090
 Burn Burn Well this hit this fill the sun cave 

00:03:10.089 --> 00:03:11.209
 I'm going 

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:14.379
 I told you from now on installation 

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:17.579
 It stagnated in the chassis at that time 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:21.049
 Reunion 

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:23.629
 japan that 

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:26.359
 It does not matter if this is said 

00:03:26.359 --> 00:03:28.930
 I wonder if there is something else on this 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:31.529
 I decided to return j1 this season 

00:03:31.529 --> 00:03:36.189
 Isn't it from each country decided to be eliminated in the cosmetic surgery league? 

00:03:41.309 --> 00:03:45.430
 Make original parts with just one word 

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:48.430
 Make it and show Keiichi Yonejima 

00:03:49.499 --> 00:03:50.719
 With video 

00:03:50.719 --> 00:03:54.299
 The road is the same as Ultraman I mentioned earlier 

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:55.399
 Will be 

00:03:55.399 --> 00:03:57.329
 Like aluminum 

00:03:57.329 --> 00:03:59.979
 More than a certain person 

00:03:59.979 --> 00:04:02.389
 Aluminum is after all 

00:04:02.389 --> 00:04:04.249
 2 lines early 

00:04:04.249 --> 00:04:05.339
 But 

00:04:05.339 --> 00:04:07.649
 This is from last year 

00:04:07.649 --> 00:04:10.649
 So the love of stainless steel and aluminum 

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:14.639
 It is not a soft color of silver 

00:04:14.639 --> 00:04:17.079
 that of jr 

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:20.389
 Weakened the soft color of full marks and the server became dominant 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:24.620
 It looks like anodized 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:27.120
 It is not an observation of aluminum 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.449
 If it were this, I was overwhelmed by the law of the par 

00:04:30.449 --> 00:04:31.319
 It seems 

00:04:31.319 --> 00:04:33.080
 That strength
