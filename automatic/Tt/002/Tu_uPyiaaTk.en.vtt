us<00:00:58.530> would<00:00:58.890> be<00:00:59.129> to<00:00:59.579> prove<00:00:59.879> that<00:01:00.180> we<00:01:00.420> are<00:01:00.600> a<00:01:00.780> good

00:01:01.099 --> 00:01:01.109 
us would be to prove that we are a good

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.240 
us would be to prove that we are a good
partner<00:01:01.410> for<00:01:01.739> FIFA<00:01:01.920> that<00:01:02.760> a<00:01:03.030> partner<00:01:03.660> that<00:01:03.809> can

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:04.250 
partner for FIFA that a partner that can

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.399 
partner for FIFA that a partner that can
begin<00:01:05.250> working<00:01:05.549> now<00:01:06.390> what<00:01:06.869> racism<00:01:07.290> and

which we think would be a foundation for

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.889 
which we think would be a foundation for
certain<00:01:44.970> activities<00:01:46.369> in<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:47.880> end<00:01:48.060> these

00:01:48.889 --> 00:01:48.899 
certain activities in the end these

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:51.679 
certain activities in the end these
activities<00:01:49.530> would<00:01:49.979> be<00:01:50.189> very<00:01:50.490> effective<00:01:50.820> so<00:01:51.600> if
