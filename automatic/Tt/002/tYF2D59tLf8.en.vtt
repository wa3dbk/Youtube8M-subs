again<00:00:22.800> if<00:00:22.890> you<00:00:22.980> didn't<00:00:23.189> see<00:00:23.279> the<00:00:23.400> other<00:00:23.430> one

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
again if you didn't see the other one

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.370 
again if you didn't see the other one
that's<00:00:23.760> the<00:00:24.210> that<00:00:24.510> is<00:00:24.660> the<00:00:24.810> meal<00:00:24.960> of<00:00:25.109> speed

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
that's the that is the meal of speed

oven<00:00:25.680> which<00:00:25.949> is<00:00:25.980> a<00:00:26.130> combination<00:00:26.340> microwave

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
oven which is a combination microwave

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.959 
oven which is a combination microwave
convection<00:00:28.340> oven<00:00:29.340> and<00:00:29.580> broiler<00:00:30.300> and<00:00:30.510> it<00:00:31.019> can

00:00:31.959 --> 00:00:31.969 
convection oven and broiler and it can

00:00:31.969 --> 00:00:35.360 
convection oven and broiler and it can
work<00:00:32.969> in<00:00:33.270> combination<00:00:33.719> so<00:00:34.530> that<00:00:34.680> it<00:00:34.800> will

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:35.370 
work in combination so that it will

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.360 
work in combination so that it will
actually<00:00:35.579> will<00:00:36.329> actually<00:00:36.719> microwave<00:00:37.440> while

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
actually will actually microwave while

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:42.619 
actually will actually microwave while
it's<00:00:38.670> broiling<00:00:39.059> and<00:00:39.739> so<00:00:40.739> it<00:00:41.309> will<00:00:41.520> well<00:00:42.360> it's

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
it's broiling and so it will well it's

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.069 
it's broiling and so it will well it's
really<00:00:42.840> a<00:00:43.190> nice<00:00:44.190> little<00:00:44.690> microwave<00:00:45.690> slash

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079

why anybody would get such an elaborate
machine<00:00:59.579> well<00:00:59.789> actually<00:01:00.210> this<00:01:00.960> this<00:01:01.680> machine

00:01:02.029 --> 00:01:02.039 
machine well actually this this machine

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.340 
machine well actually this this machine
is<00:01:02.160> an<00:01:02.309> espresso<00:01:02.699> slash<00:01:03.390> coffee<00:01:03.809> machine

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
is an espresso slash coffee machine

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.219 
is an espresso slash coffee machine
super<00:01:04.650> automatic<00:01:05.339> it<00:01:05.780> if<00:01:06.780> we<00:01:06.930> look<00:01:07.080> inside

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
super automatic it if we look inside

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.420 
super automatic it if we look inside
we'll<00:01:07.979> see<00:01:08.250> that<00:01:08.430> it<00:01:09.500> will<00:01:10.500> see<00:01:10.710> that<00:01:10.860> this<00:01:11.280> is

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
we'll see that it will see that this is

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:12.740 
we'll see that it will see that this is
and<00:01:11.640> this<00:01:11.729> by<00:01:11.880> the<00:01:11.909> way<00:01:12.030> is<00:01:12.210> the<00:01:12.330> reason<00:01:12.600> that<00:01:12.689> I

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
and this by the way is the reason that I

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.780 
and this by the way is the reason that I
got<00:01:12.840> this<00:01:13.350> it's<00:01:13.560> a<00:01:13.650> little<00:01:13.799> difficult<00:01:14.400> to<00:01:14.460> see

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
got this it's a little difficult to see

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.170 
got this it's a little difficult to see
in<00:01:14.909> this<00:01:15.000> video<00:01:15.240> because<00:01:15.509> it's<00:01:15.720> so<00:01:15.960> dark<00:01:16.409> but

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.180 
in this video because it's so dark but

straight out this is storage for ground
coffee<00:01:27.330> you<00:01:27.750> never<00:01:27.930> use<00:01:28.200> that<00:01:28.229> if<00:01:28.560> you<00:01:28.650> just

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
coffee you never use that if you just

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:31.100 
coffee you never use that if you just
put<00:01:29.040> put<00:01:29.640> ground<00:01:29.850> coffee<00:01:30.180> in<00:01:30.479> you<00:01:30.659> put<00:01:30.900> it<00:01:30.990> in

put put ground coffee in you put it in
one<00:01:31.770> at<00:01:31.890> a<00:01:31.950> time<00:01:32.130> this<00:01:32.880> is<00:01:33.540> the<00:01:33.840> water

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
one at a time this is the water

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:36.770 
one at a time this is the water
reservoir<00:01:34.530> and<00:01:35.189> since<00:01:35.850> this<00:01:36.090> machine<00:01:36.570> is

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
reservoir and since this machine is

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.399 
reservoir and since this machine is
plumbed<00:01:37.170> in<00:01:37.409> automatically<00:01:38.009> that<00:01:38.820> fills

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:39.409 
plumbed in automatically that fills

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:41.359 
plumbed in automatically that fills
automatically<00:01:40.409> the<00:01:40.500> Machine<00:01:40.829> handles<00:01:41.189> it

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
automatically the Machine handles it

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:47.450 
automatically the Machine handles it
this<00:01:42.119> is<00:01:42.420> the<00:01:43.140> waste<00:01:44.090> receptacle<00:01:45.119> so<00:01:46.460> the

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
this is the waste receptacle so the

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.609 
this is the waste receptacle so the
expended<00:01:48.149> coffee<00:01:48.390> grounds<00:01:48.930> go<00:01:49.290> into<00:01:49.500> there

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
expended coffee grounds go into there

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:51.350 
expended coffee grounds go into there
and<00:01:49.890> dump<00:01:50.340> them<00:01:50.579> and<00:01:50.610> as<00:01:50.820> a<00:01:50.880> matter<00:01:51.030> of<00:01:51.060> fact<00:01:51.240> I

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:51.360 
and dump them and as a matter of fact I

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.289 
and dump them and as a matter of fact I
think<00:01:51.509> I'll<00:01:51.630> do<00:01:51.840> that<00:01:51.990> right<00:01:52.229> now

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:53.299 
think I'll do that right now

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:56.690 
think I'll do that right now
looks<00:01:54.299> like<00:01:54.479> they're<00:01:54.659> messy<00:01:55.079> we<00:01:55.409> just<00:01:55.619> dump<00:01:56.610> it

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
looks like they're messy we just dump it

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.560 
looks like they're messy we just dump it
down<00:01:56.880> in<00:01:57.060> the<00:01:57.119> garbage<00:01:57.619> here<00:01:58.619> and<00:01:59.060> this<00:02:00.060> is<00:02:00.360> the

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
down in the garbage here and this is the

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.980 
down in the garbage here and this is the
drip<00:02:00.810> tray<00:02:01.020> and<00:02:01.469> it<00:02:01.799> looks<00:02:01.950> like<00:02:02.130> I've<00:02:02.369> got<00:02:02.399> a<00:02:02.579> I

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:02.990 
drip tray and it looks like I've got a I

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:05.569 
drip tray and it looks like I've got a I
was<00:02:03.990> messing<00:02:04.229> with<00:02:04.380> this<00:02:04.560> machine<00:02:04.890> earlier<00:02:05.340> so

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
was messing with this machine earlier so

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:09.169 
was messing with this machine earlier so
I<00:02:05.610> have<00:02:05.880> some

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.339 

collected<00:02:09.750> a<00:02:09.810> bit<00:02:09.989> of<00:02:11.629> drainage<00:02:12.629> so<00:02:13.140> we'll

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
collected a bit of drainage so we'll

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:17.619 
collected a bit of drainage so we'll
rinse<00:02:13.920> that<00:02:14.129> out<00:02:14.959> it's<00:02:15.959> really<00:02:16.200> simple

00:02:17.619 --> 00:02:17.629 
rinse that out it's really simple

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:23.530 
rinse that out it's really simple

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:02.000 
how it works and I will probably be

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.750 
how it works and I will probably be
doing<00:06:02.150> some<00:06:02.540> more<00:06:03.040> videos<00:06:04.040> on<00:06:04.400> the
