that the jaws are number one two three
four<00:03:35.910> and<00:03:36.209> it<00:03:36.599> is<00:03:36.720> important<00:03:37.200> that<00:03:37.230> you<00:03:38.629> remove

00:03:39.619 --> 00:03:39.629 
four and it is important that you remove

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:45.650 
four and it is important that you remove
them<00:03:40.099> or<00:03:41.099> I<00:03:41.129> should<00:03:41.370> say<00:03:41.579> install<00:03:41.970> them<00:03:44.660> in

them or I should say install them in
that<00:03:45.840> sequence<00:03:47.120> for<00:03:48.120> accuracy<00:03:52.220> see<00:03:53.220> you<00:03:53.310> might

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:53.459 
that sequence for accuracy see you might

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:55.729 
that sequence for accuracy see you might
get<00:03:53.700> this<00:03:53.819> one<00:03:53.880> without<00:03:54.690> losing<00:03:55.440> the<00:03:55.500> screw

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739 
get this one without losing the screw

00:03:55.739 --> 00:04:02.809 
get this one without losing the screw

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:45.220 
flying out and one of the really nice

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:46.920 
flying out and one of the really nice
things<00:04:45.280> I<00:04:45.610> mean<00:04:45.760> people<00:04:46.030> some<00:04:46.480> people<00:04:46.750> like

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:46.930 
things I mean people some people like

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:49.280 
things I mean people some people like
that<00:04:47.110> some<00:04:47.350> people<00:04:47.410> don't<00:04:47.830> like<00:04:48.010> that<00:04:48.220> on<00:04:48.430> the

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:49.290 
that some people don't like that on the

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:51.120 
that some people don't like that on the
accidents<00:04:50.290> to<00:04:50.380> chunk<00:04:50.650> that's<00:04:50.770> not<00:04:50.980> available

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:51.130 
accidents to chunk that's not available

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:53.550 
accidents to chunk that's not available
on<00:04:51.640> the<00:04:52.090> Vic<00:04:52.300> Mart<00:04:52.570> truck<00:04:52.810> it<00:04:52.960> is<00:04:53.050> available

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:53.560 
on the Vic Mart truck it is available

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:56.640 
on the Vic Mart truck it is available
but<00:04:53.680> it's<00:04:53.830> a<00:04:53.950> pin<00:04:54.250> a<00:04:54.580> roll<00:04:55.570> pin<00:04:55.870> which<00:04:56.620> is

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:56.650 
but it's a pin a roll pin which is

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:59.250 
but it's a pin a roll pin which is
tapped<00:04:57.040> in<00:04:57.310> here<00:04:58.210> it's<00:04:58.480> a<00:04:58.570> little<00:04:58.780> hard<00:04:58.930> to<00:04:59.050> see

00:04:59.250 --> 00:04:59.260 
tapped in here it's a little hard to see

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.120 
tapped in here it's a little hard to see
but<00:04:59.740> it's<00:04:59.920> actually<00:05:00.340> a<00:05:00.370> threaded<00:05:01.030> set<00:05:01.330> screw

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:02.130 
but it's actually a threaded set screw

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:05.700 
but it's actually a threaded set screw
so<00:05:03.130> if<00:05:03.640> you<00:05:03.850> choose<00:05:04.120> not<00:05:04.390> to<00:05:04.450> use<00:05:04.660> it<00:05:04.810> you<00:05:05.530> take

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:05.710 
so if you choose not to use it you take

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:09.840 
so if you choose not to use it you take
the<00:05:05.860> set<00:05:06.220> screw<00:05:06.460> out<00:05:06.640> put<00:05:07.300> it<00:05:07.420> aside<00:05:08.520> you<00:05:09.520> come

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:09.850 
the set screw out put it aside you come

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:11.400 
the set screw out put it aside you come
back<00:05:09.970> another<00:05:10.180> time<00:05:10.390> if<00:05:10.780> you<00:05:10.870> want<00:05:11.110> to<00:05:11.260> engage

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:11.410 
back another time if you want to engage

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:13.680 
back another time if you want to engage
that<00:05:11.800> feature<00:05:12.070> put<00:05:12.940> the<00:05:13.060> set<00:05:13.240> screw<00:05:13.450> back<00:05:13.630> in

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:13.690 
that feature put the set screw back in

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:16.800 
that feature put the set screw back in
it's<00:05:14.140> not<00:05:14.320> a<00:05:14.380> one-time<00:05:14.920> operation<00:05:15.690> like<00:05:16.690> you

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:16.810 
it's not a one-time operation like you

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:18.600 
it's not a one-time operation like you
have<00:05:16.990> with<00:05:17.110> some<00:05:17.320> other<00:05:17.470> chunks<00:05:17.740> okay<00:05:18.550> so

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:18.610 
have with some other chunks okay so

00:05:18.610 --> 00:05:20.460 
have with some other chunks okay so
let's<00:05:18.940> put<00:05:19.120> it<00:05:19.210> back<00:05:19.330> let's<00:05:19.900> put<00:05:19.960> that<00:05:20.230> back

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:20.470 
let's put it back let's put that back

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:40.680 
let's put it back let's put that back
number<00:05:20.740> four<00:05:21.100> I<00:05:39.180> recommend<00:05:40.180> doing<00:05:40.270> this<00:05:40.480> by

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:40.690 
number four I recommend doing this by

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:43.770 
number four I recommend doing this by
hand<00:05:40.740> not<00:05:41.740> using<00:05:42.100> a<00:05:42.130> power<00:05:42.340> screwdriver<00:05:42.780> even

screw heads and screw threads intact so
there<00:05:51.790> you<00:05:51.910> have<00:05:51.940> it<00:05:52.210> okay<00:05:54.810> let's<00:05:55.810> go<00:05:55.960> through

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:55.990 
there you have it okay let's go through

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:57.240
