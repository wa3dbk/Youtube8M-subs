like I said I have the hardware is

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:07.310 
like I said I have the hardware is
coming<00:04:04.260> for<00:04:04.410> the<00:04:04.500> brakes<00:04:04.770> and<00:04:06.110> the<00:04:07.110> lower

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:07.320 
coming for the brakes and the lower

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:13.430 
coming for the brakes and the lower
control<00:04:07.590> arms<00:04:09.050> also<00:04:10.050> the<00:04:10.530> T<00:04:11.270> that<00:04:12.270> runs<00:04:12.600> you

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
control arms also the T that runs you

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:14.510 
control arms also the T that runs you
know<00:04:13.590> for<00:04:13.890> your<00:04:14.010> brake

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:14.520 
know for your brake

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:17.900 
know for your brake
it's<00:04:14.820> a<00:04:15.560> brake<00:04:16.560> line<00:04:16.830> fitting<00:04:17.250> that<00:04:17.370> runs<00:04:17.640> your

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910 
it's a brake line fitting that runs your

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:22.190 
it's a brake line fitting that runs your
two<00:04:18.979> brake<00:04:19.979> lines<00:04:20.250> together<00:04:20.700> up<00:04:20.940> to<00:04:20.970> the<00:04:21.180> frame

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.200 
two brake lines together up to the frame

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:28.370 
two brake lines together up to the frame
that's<00:04:22.380> common<00:04:22.920> uh<00:04:25.040> and<00:04:26.780> after<00:04:27.780> that<00:04:28.140> I<00:04:28.170> think

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:28.380 
that's common uh and after that I think
