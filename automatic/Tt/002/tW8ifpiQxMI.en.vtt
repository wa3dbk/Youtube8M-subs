00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.389
 so my ladies and gentlemen was a new one 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:06.420
 episode 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:09.630
 call of duty is back at 2pm every day 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.210
 day is not forget my episode 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.110
 upload 

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:16.590
 happens sometimes at many 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:28.920
 one projects that you alone high places 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:33.859
 man on 5 12345 no no 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.859
 the sound gets something it goes on 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:39.079
 You know what I've always noticed 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.760
 when I see so pictures on facebook 

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:44.550
 one of you posted a picture of 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:46.890
 either the broadcast again that 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:51.260
 girl is supposed to be twelve but that 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.260
 zoom a shisha are not bad 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:56.899
 I do not think that children today 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:59.340
 more children are already 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:02.100
 Adolescent adults almost 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:05.690
 films in our team this time the betrays 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.690
 the last time last kill has made 

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:14.100
 So I somehow do not know 

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.720
 at twelve did not interest me 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.689
 I have the latest cell phone or that 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:21.930
 latest tablet or shisha smoker with 

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:25.250
 Twelve I was interested in whether sonko the 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.250
 will win next fight 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.180
 So there I have changed a lot 

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.050
 the upholstery days are the children 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.360
 much more expensive than before 

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:40.430
 In the past we only wanted to play with toys 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.620
 Twelve nowadays is said to twelfth 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.060
 play to play back the victims something going on 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:46.760
 with the head the smartphone 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:49.280
 I'm clapping back I think so 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:52.580
 back I'll give you a beating you 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:55.760
 together and nowadays they are 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:59.270
 not a little freer not free 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:00.979
 but big deadline but still 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.740
 nothing big behind it and even more 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:05.330
 fear 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:07.600
 you have to prove yourself full girlfriend 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:10.520
 one he has to cool his traveling 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.880
 I do not know anything 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:15.980
 proud that I am 90 years old 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:18.740
 after our generation, it all happens 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.930
 down this really is that way 

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:29.780
 they say this is because youth today 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:33.650
 yes the older much dearer right now but 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:36.500
 I think that's just no idea why 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:38.390
 to the 2000 kg two years were yes 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.640
 always kids children 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:42.530
 ok, but also a video game 

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:44.150
 our video games will not be that 

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:48.680
 all day we were the gambles 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:50.630
 all day outside but nowadays has 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.080
 yes, my child it now eight hours 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:53.080
 the playstation 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:56.709
 and if you go with it somewhere 

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.209
 go to the psychologist and yourself 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:59.980
 complains my child is eight part of 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:03.400
 Playstation says the psychologist 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:05.500
 which only eight what has her son can go 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:09.090
 he only eight hours of a sudden 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:12.280
 or your daughter can do that 

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:13.810
 I had already spring 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:17.019
 bad conscience if i have more than 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:18.120
 an hour has played the times 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:20.170
 change 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:24.489
 you have to be a bit open 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:26.769
 but just stuff for example with 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:28.870
 Twelve shisha smoking that works 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:32.379
 not if that's right , too 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:34.620
 that currently the asi stations are 

00:03:32.379 --> 00:03:36.299
 not real 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:40.150
 yet maybe that's 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:41.650
 truth shoots shisha smoke smoking 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:47.349
 generally smoking is no longer cool 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:49.239
 is out is also a drug of need 

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:51.099
 You can also become heavily dependent on us 

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:52.660
 of video games you have to play video games 

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:55.629
 You can not overdo it, you have to 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:57.310
 I always play games yes 

00:03:55.629 --> 00:03:59.410
 neither do I probably think so 

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:03.340
 play games at home all day long 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:05.290
 that's not the half no 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:08.380
 there are parts i am a bit 

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:10.150
 Actually, I have nothing in mind when 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:12.940
 I also chill and there are days where I am 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:14.349
 then family family visitors of course 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:16.900
 it's always family visit 

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:21.180
 most important because then there are just where I am 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:21.180
 enter the real world 

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:27.930
 so where I can not find him at pc 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:34.170
 turn on then enough before the 

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:36.360
 all follow have uploaded but also 

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:37.800
 when i sit on the pc for a longer time i go 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:40.470
 either into the gym studio 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:46.530
 little sport or at home couple 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:48.960
 liegestÃ¼tzen setups because you need 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:53.060
 Movement movement is also important throughout 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:53.060
 Dry is not so good 

00:04:57.290 --> 00:05:01.790
 sports in general it is important to me 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:10.410
 I think everyone has one too 

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:12.389
 Visit sports club when you are young 

00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:14.039
 visit sports club or one 

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:15.960
 to do sports activity 

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:17.669
 There are so many sports there are 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:19.280
 many options do not mind for everyone 

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:23.750
 there is something there 

00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:23.750
 you just have to know what you want 

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:31.350
 and you have to be with a right one 

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:33.240
 reason to participate 

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:34.500
 I can say I want to go boxing 

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:38.190
 so that the nature try something on the 

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:39.960
 give food you can say I am boxing 

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:43.050
 go so that I can defend myself 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:45.720
 and not i'm boxing with it 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:49.050
 anyone can beat me 

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:50.400
 Comes come like boxing 

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:52.800
 build self-confidence 

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:55.080
 i am boxing going for people too 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:57.210
 protect but do not want to box and 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:58.800
 Horsemen beating on the street together 

00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:00.889
 in the fair a little money 

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.889
 to earn 

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:10.889
 Mike in boxing is the best that is 

00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:21.860
 all former semi-professionals or people 

00:06:10.889 --> 00:06:21.860
 the cpus may have died 

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.460
 Requires many parking errors 

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:36.740
 very nice like her next time 

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:38.300
 if you want to box then do not go 

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:43.450
 box and says something to the face 

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:46.450
 but to build trust 

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:46.450
 self-confidence
