00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
really good trick to keeping track of

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.410 
really good trick to keeping track of
where<00:01:37.560> your<00:01:38.280> puff<00:01:38.520> stitches<00:01:38.820> are<00:01:39.060> gonna<00:01:39.210> line

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
where your puff stitches are gonna line

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.359 
where your puff stitches are gonna line
up<00:01:39.630> is<00:01:41.390> count<00:01:42.390> from<00:01:42.720> the<00:01:42.899> end<00:01:43.079> so<00:01:43.439> one<00:01:43.950> two

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
up is count from the end so one two

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.319 
up is count from the end so one two
three<00:01:44.909> I<00:01:45.149> know<00:01:45.450> that<00:01:45.930> I<00:01:46.229> put<00:01:47.159> three<00:01:47.880> single

crochets<00:01:48.810> on<00:01:49.079> each<00:01:49.409> end<00:01:49.710> so<00:01:50.479> that<00:01:51.479> means<00:01:51.899> I

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:52.140 
crochets on each end so that means I

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.440 
crochets on each end so that means I
need<00:01:52.200> to<00:01:52.470> do<00:01:52.619> a<00:01:52.649> puff<00:01:53.009> stitch<00:01:53.270> into<00:01:54.270> this
