 while the arepazo we are passing the body mass index will be a 

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:15.759
 approximate measurement 

00:01:15.759 --> 00:01:21.079
 about behavior profile we know if adopted standards we had 

00:01:21.079 --> 00:01:24.640
 some kind of obesity in generated so much baseness of legit 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.340
 this talks about how infrastructure with france

 imported I never predominating the most amount of fat that I have in my body 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:42.270
 because it can be is that usually always differs the man and a woman in 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:43.940
 an android bladder 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:48.080
 min 90 nikolic that means he reports hacking 

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.290
 try it later 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.980
 and how are we going to spread every africa obesity plan 

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:59.540
 without leaving the shadows of suspicion of spying in the shape of an apple this guy is 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:01.540
 say that the accumulation of fat 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:02.890

 around the indigenous area of ​​this fact ntx 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.129
 more reduced obesity is to say that this whole area is also 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:14.989
 I am as it is said the processes better said accident one of the 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:15.620
 careers 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.530
 knows the requirements established in two of its lines and forms that are going 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.499
 to support nicolini 

00:02:22.499 --> 00:02:24.520
 lizán relationship with women 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.930
 the woman has something special in a spiral 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.860
 finally, because the predominant factor is the lowering of the 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:32.659
 offended 

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:34.459
 the roads of the iraq area 

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:35.329
 at school 

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:36.629
 and the general culture 

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:41.680
 started to grow more technical in that sense we have to differentiate what kind of 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.099
 society that also differentiates it with neighbors that do not know itself when having 

00:02:46.099 --> 00:02:50.219
 it does some form of pear with a way of his fans with us 

00:02:50.219 --> 00:02:53.319
 we are talking about the need of the man we had seen good 

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:57.069
 is related to cardiovascular diseases 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:01.359
 because it is an area where there is double that accumulates in the fat that you make in 

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:03.239
 a little more to the civil heart 

00:03:03.239 --> 00:03:06.739
 and that is the normal operation between complaints related to hypertension 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:10.050
 arterial with cardiovascular problems 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:11.959
 the control in master c 

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:14.049
 16m too 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:18.040
 of state accounts that's why it would be good to highlight reduce 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.450
 Eurostar also seven pesos 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:24.239
 and try to maintain they are always the closest to the standards 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:29.079
 with respect to the woman killer is related to incoherent mash 

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:30.720
 with the circulatory system 

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:35.080
 of the mine in Herat and 2010 at the level of the martyr because the manager of the singer 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:36.699
 of the hips puebla 

00:03:36.699 --> 00:03:37.809
 from the stands 

00:03:37.809 --> 00:03:41.549
 those who suffer most and live said that the woman has after having 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:43.839
 cardiovascular diseases 

00:03:43.839 --> 00:03:46.409
 that's why he also placed 11 women 

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:51.629
 some sports vote a physical activity and also that disaffection the most 

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:55.709
 normal as close to normal as you can see what we are going to do 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:04:01.269
 attack let's all take a tape measure so that we start amelio and that 

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:01.900
 let's see 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:06.480
 the obesity figures by what kind of overweight do we have in that order 

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:09.659
 let's grab a tape measure 

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:12.740
 we are going to place those around the culture 

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:16.950
 so that you can percent of the waist circumference the 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:20.940
 president of the medical board has to be virgin parallel the prosecutor 

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.900
 competent chemistry replica awaiting that I do not understand anything in the part of 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:25.420
 behind 

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:29.610
 and when it was of any other person that was direct a few days later, 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:32.550
 figure that was to take the measurements better with you 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:33.690
 for the afternoon 

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:37.870
 can compensate the amount of centimeters then low profile other 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:39.289
 pistone people 

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:43.930
 and equal measure xinhua these difficult hours also for her 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:48.199
 Algiers this time, it's not too much, that's why it's a lie or not 

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:52.150
 if we go we raise the rib cage up and what causes this 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:53.520
 I said the paintings 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.759
 and we would not be 15 years old, it's about turning 

00:04:56.759 --> 00:04:58.120
 one breath or weeks 

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:02.760
 and just taken the circumference of the painting when we are going to do with the 

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:07.090
 races we're going to do exactly the same we're going to take the races up 

00:05:07.090 --> 00:05:07.789
 having 

00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:12.759
 if it can be percent without better clothes or can cut the grill that do not have 

00:05:12.759 --> 00:05:14.479
 a doctor who tried to avoid it 

00:05:14.479 --> 00:05:16.110
 the system is better than now 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:21.160
 if we're going to take the usual 10 race about the tail means we're going to 

00:05:21.159 --> 00:05:25.789
 take as tape measure cuts page around percent around 

00:05:25.789 --> 00:05:30.250
 the palm inc and military career parallel to the floor and perfection the person 

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:31.389
 also day 

00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:34.639
 matter because it has come out in defense of missiles 

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:37.110
 we are going to kill him and later 

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:39.120
 4 the streets 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:42.790
 upper waist circumference we are talking about one 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:47.440
 in a differentiated way, the profile of the man as in the woman 

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:49.749
 finally they suffer 

00:05:49.749 --> 00:05:52.650
 and if it's the other way around, it predominates 

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:56.990
 Benigni figure in Rome has reminded that the race we are talking about a 

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:00.210
 Obesity apple-shaped finally also press 

00:06:01.749 --> 00:06:03.010
 foot treatment 

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:04.580
 this kind of events 

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:09.139
 enterprise I am worried about what I tell you what we can do to improve this 

00:06:09.139 --> 00:06:12.710
 type obesity without shooting and logically is our quality of life
