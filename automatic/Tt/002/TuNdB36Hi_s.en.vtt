Mayweather<00:00:58.410> winning<00:00:59.160> it<00:00:59.489> was<00:00:59.670> it<00:00:59.850> was<00:00:59.969> close

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
Mayweather winning it was it was close

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.410 
Mayweather winning it was it was close
though<00:01:00.390> it<00:01:00.449> was<00:01:00.539> like<00:01:01.489> 116-112<00:01:02.489> something

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
though it was like 116-112 something

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:04.729 
though it was like 116-112 something
like<00:01:03.539> that<00:01:03.690> and<00:01:03.840> it<00:01:03.899> was<00:01:03.989> only<00:01:04.110> a<00:01:04.199> few<00:01:04.409> points

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
like that and it was only a few points

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:10.460 
like that and it was only a few points
off<00:01:04.890> but<00:01:06.049> um<00:01:07.049> just<00:01:08.010> early<00:01:08.670> on<00:01:08.850> you<00:01:09.090> had<00:01:09.470> Maidana

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
off but um just early on you had Maidana

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:13.070 
off but um just early on you had Maidana
just<00:01:10.830> killing<00:01:11.790> him<00:01:11.880> first<00:01:12.150> round<00:01:12.390> was<00:01:12.720> I<00:01:12.750> think

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
just killing him first round was I think

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.450 
just killing him first round was I think
everyone<00:01:13.409> knew<00:01:13.619> that<00:01:13.650> this<00:01:13.950> was<00:01:14.130> gonna<00:01:14.220> be<00:01:14.430> a

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:14.460 
everyone knew that this was gonna be a

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.179 
everyone knew that this was gonna be a
fight<00:01:14.760> and<00:01:15.110> the<00:01:16.110> head<00:01:16.290> shots<00:01:16.590> were<00:01:16.799> missing

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
fight and the head shots were missing

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.800 
fight and the head shots were missing
but<00:01:17.369> a<00:01:17.400> lot<00:01:17.549> of<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:17.729> body<00:01:17.909> shots<00:01:18.210> were<00:01:18.390> landing

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810 
but a lot of the body shots were landing

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.550 
but a lot of the body shots were landing
and<00:01:19.710> I<00:01:20.280> was<00:01:20.400> just<00:01:20.640> just<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:21.689> way<00:01:21.840> I<00:01:22.140> think<00:01:22.409> a

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
and I was just just the way I think a

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.380 
and I was just just the way I think a
lot<00:01:22.770> of<00:01:22.799> people<00:01:22.890> expected<00:01:23.580> Maidana<00:01:24.000> just<00:01:24.270> to

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
lot of people expected Maidana just to

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:26.149 
lot of people expected Maidana just to
really<00:01:24.570> go<00:01:24.810> in<00:01:24.990> there<00:01:25.200> and<00:01:25.320> just<00:01:25.470> start

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
really go in there and just start

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.679 
really go in there and just start
wailing<00:01:26.670> at<00:01:26.820> him<00:01:26.970> and<00:01:27.030> that's<00:01:27.180> exactly<00:01:27.330> what

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
wailing at him and that's exactly what

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.560 
wailing at him and that's exactly what
he<00:01:27.750> did<00:01:27.810> and<00:01:28.200> for<00:01:29.189> me<00:01:29.340> I<00:01:29.369> thought<00:01:29.729> well<00:01:30.329> as<00:01:30.420> his

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
he did and for me I thought well as his

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.660 
he did and for me I thought well as his
cardio<00:01:30.960> is<00:01:31.049> really<00:01:31.290> good<00:01:31.530> you<00:01:31.560> got<00:01:31.950> um<00:01:32.220> he<00:01:32.640> just

gassed<00:01:33.060> himself<00:01:33.450> out<00:01:33.689> within<00:01:34.020> the<00:01:34.470> first

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
gassed himself out within the first

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:37.249 
gassed himself out within the first
maybe<00:01:35.009> three<00:01:35.340> rounds<00:01:35.790> and<00:01:35.939> that's<00:01:36.780> when<00:01:37.020> Floyd

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
maybe three rounds and that's when Floyd

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:38.810 
maybe three rounds and that's when Floyd
really<00:01:37.530> started<00:01:37.770> to<00:01:37.829> pick<00:01:38.009> things<00:01:38.189> up<00:01:38.400> he<00:01:38.670> had

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.010 
round four and then round five was
Madonna<00:01:40.979> again<00:01:41.369> and<00:01:41.579> then<00:01:42.210> six<00:01:42.540> seven<00:01:42.930> eight

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
Madonna again and then six seven eight

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.679

nine<00:01:43.170> ten<00:01:43.500> was<00:01:44.430> all<00:01:44.610> Floyd<00:01:44.939> and<00:01:45.210> then<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.479> last

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
nine ten was all Floyd and then the last

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.469 
nine ten was all Floyd and then the last
two<00:01:45.930> rounds<00:01:46.110> my<00:01:46.439> dad<00:01:46.619> was<00:01:46.860> able<00:01:47.130> to<00:01:47.479> get

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
two rounds my dad was able to get

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.359 
two rounds my dad was able to get
something<00:01:48.930> together<00:01:49.079> but<00:01:49.500> Mayweather

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
something together but Mayweather

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.999 
something together but Mayweather
definitely<00:01:51.030> definitely<00:01:51.899> controlled<00:01:52.860> the

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
definitely definitely controlled the

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.190 
definitely definitely controlled the
second<00:01:53.340> half<00:01:53.520> of<00:01:53.640> that<00:01:53.670> fight<00:01:53.970> and<00:01:54.600> I<00:01:54.990> think

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
second half of that fight and I think

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.170 
second half of that fight and I think
that's<00:01:55.350> where<00:01:55.530> it<00:01:55.649> all<00:01:55.740> came<00:01:55.979> down<00:01:56.040> to<00:01:56.250> you

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
that's where it all came down to you

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.760 
that's where it all came down to you
watched<00:01:57.420> round<00:01:57.780> one<00:01:58.020> and<00:01:58.049> you<00:01:58.320> watch<00:01:58.500> maybe

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
watched round one and you watch maybe

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:01.459 
watched round one and you watch maybe
around<00:01:59.070> eight<00:01:59.369> and<00:01:59.640> you<00:01:59.670> just<00:01:59.880> see<00:02:00.469> Mayweather

00:02:01.459 --> 00:02:01.469 
around eight and you just see Mayweather

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.770 
around eight and you just see Mayweather
really<00:02:01.770> adapting<00:02:02.340> to<00:02:02.369> what<00:02:02.700> Maidana<00:02:03.540> was

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
really adapting to what Maidana was

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.200 
really adapting to what Maidana was
doing<00:02:04.079> in<00:02:04.200> his<00:02:04.350> style<00:02:04.649> and<00:02:05.009> I<00:02:05.460> think<00:02:05.700> he<00:02:06.060> was

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
doing in his style and I think he was

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.300 
doing in his style and I think he was
caught<00:02:06.420> off<00:02:06.600> guard<00:02:06.630> for<00:02:07.439> the<00:02:07.590> first<00:02:07.829> three

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
caught off guard for the first three

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.249 
caught off guard for the first three
rounds<00:02:08.489> and<00:02:08.819> he<00:02:08.910> got<00:02:09.060> busted<00:02:09.330> open<00:02:09.660> in<00:02:09.929> the<00:02:10.080> in

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
rounds and he got busted open in the in

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.570 
rounds and he got busted open in the in
the<00:02:10.289> fourth<00:02:10.619> round<00:02:10.709> she<00:02:11.099> said<00:02:11.280> it<00:02:11.400> was<00:02:11.550> a

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
the fourth round she said it was a

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:13.050
