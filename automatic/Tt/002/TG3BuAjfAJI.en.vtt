release those collections I honestly
thought<00:04:51.170> those<00:04:51.410> were<00:04:51.530> going<00:04:51.710> to<00:04:51.860> be<00:04:51.950> released

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:52.310 
thought those were going to be released

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:54.490 
thought those were going to be released
this<00:04:52.490> weekend<00:04:52.940> as<00:04:53.090> an<00:04:53.240> update<00:04:53.630> I<00:04:53.840> think<00:04:54.380> they

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:54.500 
this weekend as an update I think they

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:55.930 
this weekend as an update I think they
are<00:04:54.620> waiting<00:04:54.920> until<00:04:54.980> the<00:04:55.190> actual<00:04:55.430> football

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:55.940 
are waiting until the actual football

00:04:55.940 --> 00:04:57.910 
are waiting until the actual football
season<00:04:56.540> starts<00:04:56.900> to<00:04:57.020> release<00:04:57.320> the<00:04:57.500> rest<00:04:57.710> of<00:04:57.830> the

00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:00.070 
season starts to release the rest of the
team<00:04:58.130> collections<00:04:58.760> until<00:04:59.330> all<00:04:59.510> teams<00:04:59.840> get

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.080 
team collections until all teams get

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.080 
team collections until all teams get
their<00:05:00.230> rosters<00:05:00.710> set<00:05:00.980> but<00:05:01.460> then<00:05:01.640> again<00:05:01.670> they

00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:02.090 
their rosters set but then again they

00:05:02.090 --> 00:05:04.060 
their rosters set but then again they

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:04.070 
may just release a couple at a time just

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:05.800 
may just release a couple at a time just
to<00:05:04.220> try<00:05:04.400> to<00:05:04.460> make<00:05:04.700> collections<00:05:05.090> last<00:05:05.570> to<00:05:05.780> the

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:05.810 
to try to make collections last to the

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:07.900 
to try to make collections last to the
end<00:05:05.930> of<00:05:06.200> the<00:05:06.320> season<00:05:06.500> I<00:05:06.920> know<00:05:07.310> I<00:05:07.430> forgot<00:05:07.790> to

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:07.910 
end of the season I know I forgot to

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:09.820 
end of the season I know I forgot to
mention<00:05:07.940> this<00:05:08.240> in<00:05:08.450> my<00:05:08.570> last<00:05:08.750> video<00:05:08.990> but<00:05:09.470> the

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:09.830 
mention this in my last video but the

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:11.440 
mention this in my last video but the
three<00:05:10.160> cards<00:05:10.490> that<00:05:10.610> you<00:05:10.700> receive<00:05:11.030> for<00:05:11.240> playing

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:11.450 
three cards that you receive for playing

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:13.690 
three cards that you receive for playing
the<00:05:11.600> demo<00:05:11.810> are<00:05:12.110> not<00:05:12.290> actionable<00:05:12.830> and<00:05:13.220> you

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:13.700 
the demo are not actionable and you

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:16.300 
the demo are not actionable and you
can't<00:05:13.940> add<00:05:14.120> contracts<00:05:14.780> to<00:05:14.960> them<00:05:15.140> so<00:05:15.770> basically

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:16.310 
can't add contracts to them so basically

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:18.040 
can't add contracts to them so basically
those<00:05:16.490> cars<00:05:16.820> will<00:05:17.000> be<00:05:17.030> useless<00:05:17.450> unless<00:05:17.750> they

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:18.050 
those cars will be useless unless they

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:19.660 
those cars will be useless unless they
decide<00:05:18.170> to<00:05:18.410> make<00:05:18.650> a<00:05:18.710> collection<00:05:19.340> for<00:05:19.520> them

00:05:19.660 --> 00:05:19.670 
decide to make a collection for them

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:21.790 
decide to make a collection for them
which<00:05:19.880> I<00:05:20.000> highly<00:05:20.180> doubt<00:05:20.600> so<00:05:21.170> that<00:05:21.350> about<00:05:21.470> does

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:21.800 
which I highly doubt so that about does

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.070 
which I highly doubt so that about does
