 first setup of google nexus 5 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.630
 though maybe many already if not 

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:17.730
 even very many of you are an android 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.859
 it will use smartphone as well 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:21.960

 now here sim card insert and 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.820
 who has taken care in unboxing is still 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.770
 know that the sim card slot on the 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.860
 right side is present I suppose 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:12.600
 this little pin lock the whole and 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.630
 the micro simcard sled comes 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:18.450
 and has a little here already 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.729
 Exhibition that allows one to 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.400
 SIM card relatively easy to insert 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:25.439
 I've done that here, I'm stuck 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:29.100
 The whole thing can then be flush 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.659
 he closes and with that can the 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.970
 actually go on first establishment 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.720
 and you get the hint now 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:37.170

 already half to three quarters 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:58.660
 minute lasted until the system is up 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:01.570
 But it is exactly this time that we take ourselves 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:03.190
 to tell you something more exactly you 

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:05.740

 until the device is started it will be 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.600
 a little brighter and actually one 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.820
 sign that the device 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.590

 Of course you know it and I'm landing 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.700
 back here on the way from the screen 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.290
 So I just have the SIM card 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.350
 Unlocked I land on the welcome 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:28.090

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:29.590
 is the wlan networks looking for me 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:32.860
 Of course, data download faster 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:34.209
 can and sorts fritzbox 73 30 thats 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:36.130
 my wifi currently here

 I go on this and can now 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:39.940
 to enter someone's password but me 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:41.440
 skip this whole process 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:42.400
 because you can sometimes with this 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.230
 Skip button 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.239
 Now I will get a hint that 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.440
 the updates also not recognized 

00:02:46.239 --> 00:02:49.959
 if I can not wlan 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.250
 add and get to the next one 

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:52.050
 namely google and location and 

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:54.010
 there are some here 

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:56.709
 Declaration of consent had been cool 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:58.480
 location data can save 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:00.580
 or apps later on 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.040
 or at a later date on the 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:05.620
 I also go down here 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.220
 Continue with the touch up 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.410
 this button 

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.880
 now it's about time and me 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:12.190
 give a Central European normal time 

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:14.650
 this is the default and usually 

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:16.780
 The system retreats 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:19.750
 time and date automatically from 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:21.190
 your provider in my case vodafone 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:23.400
 and here I go and the 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:25.810
 time and just automatically 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.370
 set google reads winners explain 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:29.380

 sent by google to your phone and 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:33.130
 can be installed on this 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:34.840
 and yes I agree with that 

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:36.700
 of course, every update makes the device 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.500
 also faster and we are already 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:41.230
 at the end of the establishment and I go up 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.610
 quit and that is just now 

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.060
 a welcome screen and you 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:45.100
 gets 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:46.540
 on the next pages again and again 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:48.430
 small tips at the first establishment 

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:50.820
 or after the first in the direction of what you 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:54.010
 join in here and I'm ok 

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:54.460
 and on the second screen I show 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:56.530
 or 

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:58.510
 organize the message workspace 

00:03:56.530 --> 00:04:00.280
 it's about how to create folders 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:00.670
 how can you change the backgrounds? 

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.170
 can 

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:04.270
 that for example now with the 

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:05.200
 google custom applications hangouts sms 

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:07.930
 can ship 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:11.410
 and I confirm that and that here too 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:15.070
 is your homescreen of the nexus 5 

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:16.780
 under android 4.4 kit kat and how to do it 

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:18.430
 you know different here 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:19.930
 Homescreens are each on a small scale 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:21.670
 indicator here at the bottom and 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:24.040
 can wipe from left to right and 

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:25.900
 the more apps i add or here 

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:28.450
 more funny to much good the more 

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:30.100
 screens are gradually here in the 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:32.770
 on the right side 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:34.540
 what the resourceful user already recognize 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:36.630
 is a small design change so is 

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:38.200
 For example, the top bar 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:40.470
 kept transparent 

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:42.520
 that is, that's all something 

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:44.200
 tidier something fresher this works 

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:46.360
 as well as here the lower bar the 

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:49.030
 navigation bar also has one 

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:50.580
 get a little update in this design 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:53.980
 and is no longer black but 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:56.380
 shows the user just more content from 

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:58.270
 the actual background about the 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:01.090
 middle button this is the app drawer 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:02.500
 I can in these individual apps 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:04.180
 go in and you see that is now 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:06.340
 currently the application on my 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:08.230
 device are installed and you see too 

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:10.810
 this is really fluid and 

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:12.670
 as liquid as you would from a nexus 

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:14.260
 smartphone knows what it is 

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:15.670
 For example, they do not have any upstairs 

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.050
 subdivision who is between apps and 

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:18.580
 widgets you only have the 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:21.250
 pure apps it is clearer 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:23.050
 has become and it cleans up the 

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:24.910
 widgets you can through a long 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:26.860
 add touch to the display 

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:28.000
 already opens a new menu and you 

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:30.400
 Here are some backgrounds 

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.740
 then end widgets or even in the 

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:35.590
 attitude and specifically for 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:37.930
 every single homescreen very short 

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:40.030
 demo here for example the 

00:05:37.930 --> 00:05:41.980
 I would like to have the digital clock right here 

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:43.630
 have my home screen and then will 

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:46.810
 she added here 

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:49.420
 So that's a quick explanation how 

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:51.010
 I have the nexus 5 1 right for more 

00:05:49.420 --> 00:05:52.450

 comparatively videos it will of course in 

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:59.080
