00:01:50.349 --> 00:01:50.359 
out about the small RH 75 is just how

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:52.090 
out about the small RH 75 is just how

hydraulic over hydraulic control so this

00:05:39.220 --> 00:05:40.830 
hydraulic over hydraulic control so this
is<00:05:39.340> how<00:05:39.460> the<00:05:39.520> machine<00:05:39.970> gets<00:05:40.180> its<00:05:40.330> power<00:05:40.480> is

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:40.840 
is how the machine gets its power is

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:42.660 
is how the machine gets its power is
with<00:05:41.530> its<00:05:41.710> hydraulics<00:05:42.190> which<00:05:42.370> bring<00:05:42.580> the
