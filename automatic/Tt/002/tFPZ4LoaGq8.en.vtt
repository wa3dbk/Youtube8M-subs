this is written in journal style which I

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:36.929 
this is written in journal style which I
think<00:01:34.179> can<00:01:34.509> be<00:01:34.539> done<00:01:34.840> so<00:01:35.170> badly<00:01:35.529> and<00:01:36.009> kind<00:01:36.759> of<00:01:36.850> a

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:36.939 
think can be done so badly and kind of a

00:01:36.939 --> 00:01:39.179 
think can be done so badly and kind of a
lazy<00:01:37.270> way<00:01:37.450> to<00:01:37.630> write<00:01:37.959> sometimes<00:01:38.289> but<00:01:38.979> dirty

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:39.189 
lazy way to write sometimes but dirty

00:01:39.189 --> 00:01:42.899 
lazy way to write sometimes but dirty
Smith<00:01:39.490> does<00:01:39.759> it<00:01:40.139> so<00:01:41.139> beautifully<00:01:41.740> it<00:01:42.249> is<00:01:42.399> so

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:42.909 
Smith does it so beautifully it is so

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:45.629 
Smith does it so beautifully it is so
believable<00:01:43.270> and<00:01:43.899> I<00:01:44.170> think<00:01:44.799> sometimes<00:01:45.100> writing

00:01:45.629 --> 00:01:45.639 
believable and I think sometimes writing

00:01:45.639 --> 00:01:48.209 
believable and I think sometimes writing
in<00:01:45.939> like<00:01:46.090> a<00:01:46.119> diary<00:01:46.479> format<00:01:47.139> can<00:01:47.499> be<00:01:47.679> difficult

00:01:48.209 --> 00:01:48.219 
in like a diary format can be difficult

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:50.639 
in like a diary format can be difficult
to<00:01:48.490> get<00:01:49.270> across<00:01:49.630> certain<00:01:49.899> plot<00:01:50.259> points

00:01:50.639 --> 00:01:50.649 
to get across certain plot points

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:51.779 
to get across certain plot points
because<00:01:50.889> it's<00:01:51.009> all<00:01:51.130> coming<00:01:51.399> from<00:01:51.429> the<00:01:51.639> one

00:01:51.779 --> 00:01:51.789

because it's all coming from the one
person's<00:01:52.179> mind<00:01:52.359> and<00:01:52.749> things<00:01:53.170> can<00:01:53.319> come<00:01:53.469> out<00:01:53.590> a

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:53.619 
person's mind and things can come out a

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:58.050 
person's mind and things can come out a
little<00:01:53.829> bit<00:01:53.950> skewed<00:01:54.479> but<00:01:55.770> it's<00:01:56.770> just<00:01:57.069> done<00:01:57.520> so

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
little bit skewed but it's just done so

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.839
