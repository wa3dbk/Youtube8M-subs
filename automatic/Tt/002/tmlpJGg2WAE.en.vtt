00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:07.670 
playing interior line
so<00:05:03.270> like<00:05:03.540> garters<00:05:03.990> Center<00:05:04.320> and<00:05:06.140> they<00:05:07.140> see<00:05:07.440> my

00:05:23.409 --> 00:05:23.419 
so you're probably projected when it was

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:25.149 
so you're probably projected when it was
announced<00:05:23.689> when<00:05:24.020> you<00:05:24.110> sign<00:05:24.379> your<00:05:24.409> projected
