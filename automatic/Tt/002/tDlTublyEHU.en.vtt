have a few of those as you might say

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:36.660 
have a few of those as you might say
well<00:02:35.200> don't<00:02:35.380> you<00:02:35.530> just<00:02:35.739> want<00:02:36.400> to<00:02:36.459> throw<00:02:36.640> a

powder to set any foundation and yes
that<00:02:40.239> does<00:02:40.420> make<00:02:40.450> sense<00:02:40.840> and<00:02:40.989> that's

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:41.170 
that does make sense and that's

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.770 
that does make sense and that's
something<00:02:41.440> I<00:02:41.650> do<00:02:41.709> a<00:02:41.860> lot<00:02:42.190> but<00:02:42.610> this<00:02:42.970> foundation

luminous silk it's all about the finish
that's<00:02:46.959> the<00:02:47.260> best<00:02:47.650> part<00:02:47.980> about<00:02:48.040> this

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
that's the best part about this

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.520 
that's the best part about this
foundation<00:02:49.000> is<00:02:49.120> the<00:02:49.360> look<00:02:49.690> on<00:02:49.900> the<00:02:50.019> skin<00:02:50.319> the

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
foundation is the look on the skin the

finish which is not entirely matte it's

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.289 
finish which is not entirely matte it's
definitely<00:02:53.769> not<00:02:53.890> shimmery<00:02:54.489> it's<00:02:54.790> just<00:02:55.090> like<00:02:55.269> a

00:02:55.289 --> 00:02:55.299 
definitely not shimmery it's just like a

00:02:55.299 --> 00:02:58.259 
definitely not shimmery it's just like a
great<00:02:55.989> finish<00:02:56.470> and<00:02:56.709> you<00:02:57.370> don't<00:02:57.610> want<00:02:58.000> to<00:02:58.090> feel

00:02:58.259 --> 00:02:58.269 
great finish and you don't want to feel

powder I was wearing this more in the
summer<00:03:01.150> months<00:03:01.420> I<00:03:01.780> noticed<00:03:01.810> my<00:03:02.200> skin<00:03:02.230> was

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
summer months I noticed my skin was

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.559 
summer months I noticed my skin was
really<00:03:02.860> able<00:03:03.190> to<00:03:03.400> break<00:03:03.819> this<00:03:04.030> down<00:03:04.239> in<00:03:04.420> my

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:04.569 
really able to break this down in my

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:07.289 
really able to break this down in my
t-zone<00:03:05.010> after<00:03:06.010> about<00:03:06.220> 2/3<00:03:06.730> of<00:03:06.849> the<00:03:06.910> day<00:03:07.120> had

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:09.059 
t-zone after about 2/3 of the day had
passed<00:03:07.329> so<00:03:07.989> that's<00:03:08.200> testing<00:03:08.680> it<00:03:08.769> without<00:03:09.010> a

00:03:09.059 --> 00:03:09.069 
passed so that's testing it without a

passed so that's testing it without a
powder<00:03:09.400> to<00:03:09.549> set<00:03:09.880> it<00:03:10.060> when<00:03:10.569> I<00:03:10.599> put<00:03:10.959> just<00:03:10.989> a

00:03:11.309 --> 00:03:11.319 
powder to set it when I put just a

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:13.170 
powder to set it when I put just a
little<00:03:11.349> bit<00:03:11.860> of<00:03:11.950> powder<00:03:12.160> on<00:03:12.430> top<00:03:12.700> of<00:03:12.940> this

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:13.180 
little bit of powder on top of this

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:14.910 
little bit of powder on top of this
especially<00:03:13.989> like<00:03:14.319> a<00:03:14.349> really<00:03:14.680> lightweight

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
especially like a really lightweight

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.490 
especially like a really lightweight
powder<00:03:15.400> I<00:03:15.549> notice<00:03:16.120> a<00:03:16.329> vast<00:03:16.810> difference<00:03:17.139> in

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
powder I notice a vast difference in

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:19.259 
powder I notice a vast difference in
staying<00:03:17.769> power<00:03:18.100> for<00:03:18.430> example<00:03:18.519> today<00:03:19.030> I'm
