this phone it's a little hard snap and
that's<00:00:23.939> one<00:00:24.090> of<00:00:24.119> the<00:00:24.210> first<00:00:24.390> things<00:00:24.539> we

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
that's one of the first things we

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.950 
that's one of the first things we
noticed<00:00:25.699> the<00:00:26.699> reason<00:00:27.150> for<00:00:27.330> that<00:00:27.359> is<00:00:27.449> we<00:00:27.720> had<00:00:27.840> to

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
noticed the reason for that is we had to

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.189 
noticed the reason for that is we had to
put<00:00:28.109> a<00:00:28.140> sim<00:00:28.410> in<00:00:28.529> there<00:00:28.710> and<00:00:28.920> this<00:00:29.730> is<00:00:29.910> an<00:00:30.199> hspa+

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
put a sim in there and this is an hspa+

00:00:58.880 --> 00:00:58.890 
1080p video it's a little bit of a step

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.560 
1080p video it's a little bit of a step
down<00:00:59.039> from<00:00:59.100> other<00:00:59.460> galaxies<00:00:59.910> as<00:01:00.000> two<00:01:00.270> devices

now<00:01:00.840> we've<00:01:01.530> taken<00:01:01.559> a<00:01:01.949> few<00:01:02.070> pictures<00:01:02.399> and<00:01:02.940> it's

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
now we've taken a few pictures and it's

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.530 
now we've taken a few pictures and it's
pretty<00:01:04.080> good<00:01:04.379> but<00:01:04.970> verdicts<00:01:05.970> still<00:01:06.060> out<00:01:06.299> as<00:01:06.510> to

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
pretty good but verdicts still out as to

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.710 
pretty good but verdicts still out as to
whether<00:01:07.470> it<00:01:07.650> was<00:01:07.770> a<00:01:07.799> good<00:01:07.979> idea<00:01:08.040> to<00:01:08.400> downgrade

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:08.720 
whether it was a good idea to downgrade

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.090 
whether it was a good idea to downgrade
you<00:01:09.720> know<00:01:09.810> it's<00:01:09.960> not<00:01:10.080> all<00:01:10.200> about<00:01:10.229> megapixels

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
you know it's not all about megapixels

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.120 
you know it's not all about megapixels
obviously<00:01:11.580> there<00:01:12.510> is<00:01:12.600> a<00:01:12.630> a<00:01:12.960> google<00:01:13.590> logo<00:01:13.619> here

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
obviously there is a a google logo here
