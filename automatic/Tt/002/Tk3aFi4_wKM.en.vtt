00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:34.630 
over top of this I'm going to pack on my

00:04:34.630 --> 00:04:38.400 
over top of this I'm going to pack on my
eye<00:04:34.660> shadow<00:04:36.720> and<00:04:37.720> then<00:04:37.840> you<00:04:37.990> can<00:04:38.139> see<00:04:38.260> the

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:38.410 
eye shadow and then you can see the

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:40.469 
eye shadow and then you can see the
difference<00:04:38.830> I<00:04:38.950> think<00:04:39.220> the<00:04:39.340> color<00:04:39.580> just<00:04:39.820> pops<00:04:40.000> a

00:04:40.469 --> 00:04:40.479 
difference I think the color just pops a

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:44.700 
difference I think the color just pops a
little<00:04:40.510> bit<00:04:40.870> more<00:04:42.720> but<00:04:43.720> where<00:04:43.990> I<00:04:44.020> get<00:04:44.350> the<00:04:44.500> most

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:44.710 
little bit more but where I get the most

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:47.310 
little bit more but where I get the most
difference<00:04:45.250> is<00:04:45.820> that<00:04:46.060> by<00:04:46.240> adding<00:04:46.540> that<00:04:46.870> cream

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:47.320 
difference is that by adding that cream

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:50.250 
difference is that by adding that cream
that<00:04:47.710> layer<00:04:48.010> in<00:04:48.340> between<00:04:48.370> the<00:04:49.050> actual<00:04:50.050> eye

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:50.260 
that layer in between the actual eye

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.710 
that layer in between the actual eye
shadow<00:04:50.560> base<00:04:50.800> and<00:04:51.130> your<00:04:51.280> eye<00:04:51.310> shadow<00:04:51.760> I<00:04:52.210> can

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:52.720 
shadow base and your eye shadow I can

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.920 
shadow base and your eye shadow I can
blend<00:04:53.470> this<00:04:53.860> a<00:04:54.130> whole<00:04:54.639> hell<00:04:55.000> of<00:04:55.030> a<00:04:55.210> lot<00:04:55.240> so<00:04:55.810> then

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:55.930 
blend this a whole hell of a lot so then

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:57.900 
blend this a whole hell of a lot so then
I<00:04:56.080> can<00:04:56.139> take<00:04:56.440> my<00:04:56.590> base<00:04:56.830> all<00:04:57.070> the<00:04:57.130> way<00:04:57.460> up<00:04:57.610> to<00:04:57.760> my

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:57.910 
I can take my base all the way up to my

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:00.690 
I can take my base all the way up to my
brow<00:04:57.940> bone<00:04:58.450> and<00:04:58.690> blend<00:04:58.750> everything<00:04:59.710> my<00:05:00.460> crease

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:00.700 
brow bone and blend everything my crease

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:04.650 
brow bone and blend everything my crease
color<00:05:00.970> my<00:05:02.100> brow<00:05:03.100> bone<00:05:03.460> like<00:05:03.850> my<00:05:04.330> brow

color my brow bone like my brow

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:06.570 
color my brow bone like my brow
highlighter<00:05:05.320> I<00:05:05.500> can<00:05:05.710> blend<00:05:06.010> all<00:05:06.280> of<00:05:06.430> that

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:06.580 
highlighter I can blend all of that

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:08.700 
highlighter I can blend all of that
together<00:05:06.760> seamlessly<00:05:07.300> without<00:05:08.050> having

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:08.710 
together seamlessly without having

00:05:08.710 --> 00:05:11.060 
together seamlessly without having
everything<00:05:09.070> stick<00:05:09.669> to<00:05:10.030> the<00:05:10.150> eyeshadow<00:05:10.600> base

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:11.070 
everything stick to the eyeshadow base
