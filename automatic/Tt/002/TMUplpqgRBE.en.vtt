00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.509
 to the girls, the first thing is to ask you 

00:00:03.709 --> 00:00:08.210
 Sorry for not uploading video in 

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:10.370
 all these weeks because the truth is 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:13.760
 that I did not feel much encouragement 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:15.860
 record and I did not want to record something that I do not know 

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:18.259
 did not have that energy from other videos 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:21.380
 so I've waited to be a little 

00:00:18.259 --> 00:00:23.839
 better and good because I have already decided to 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:25.820
 record this video that is a hall and os 

00:00:23.839 --> 00:00:28.669
 I will teach nothing few things that I 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:32.850
 have arrived three little things are from one 

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:36.780
 online store that is called something point is 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:39.629
 and it's a store that is related to 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.989
 Sami dress but it's a store that you 

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:46.019
 sells everything is an ebay type and is for 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:50.070
 Spain, the first thing that he asked me there was 

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:54.210
 this thing that is very rare is worth 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:56.969
 a flan or a jelly that you make a 

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.890
 ball and then it serves to remove 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.500
 all the fluffs that stay between 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.180
 the computer keys for example or 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:06.820
 little fuzzy is that they stay inside the 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:08.890
 dryer then you with that gelatin 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:13.390
 fits the figure you want 

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:15.790
 clean and stick the lint to the jelly 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:18.040
 with which he takes them and good 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:19.960
 truth is that it cost quite a bit 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:22.780
 I will leave all the links below so that 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.280
 you see and it is a product that is very well 

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.290
 to clean the cyclicals of the 

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.509
 computer that had to be cleaned 

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:31.210
 he also asked me for this blanket of brushes 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:34.090
 I do not know its exact price but it was 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.800
 pretty cheap come 16 brushes yes 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.590
 you want a more extensive review of the 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:41.050
 brushes you do not pass anything come 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:43.360
 of everything of face of eyes for the 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:45.399
 lashes and so on and it's pretty good 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:48.130
 for the price it brings because it's not a 

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:50.500
 product of very poor quality to three or 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:53.170
 four brushes of 16 are dropped some 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:56.289
 hairs but the others are quite soft 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:58.810
 and they are not bad in terms of amount of 

00:01:56.289 --> 00:02:02.380
 hairs finally on this page asked me 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:05.880
 a palette of shadows of 72 shadows that 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:08.739
 come both matt and bright and are 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:11.440
 well the first thing that surprised me is 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:12.050
 that he put mac makeup and I did not know for 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.810
 nothing what 

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:17.960
 one fake of the others are all 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:21.620
 white brown tones creams but there 

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:24.440
 three or four that are pink and you do not see 

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.630
 as for pigmentation they are quite 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.700
 acceptable resemble pigmentation 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:32.270
 and duration that have the shadows of 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:34.340
 kiko and good for travel and so on is a 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:36.440
 palette that is very finite that is not very 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.960
 great and that you can take it to all 

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.880
 the sites my last thing of makeup 

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:44.060
 already leaving this web page this 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.050
 I bought it separately at the airport and it's 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.230
 a product of the sea 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:53.270
 this really is the powder 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:55.640
 studio fix in the tone c 5.5 and are about 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:57.880
 powders that good already to it already it is me 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:00.190
 finishing ones that I have of kiko 

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:02.770
 and I needed some so I wanted to 

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:04.480
 try the others because I'm good because it's 

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:06.550
 a good brand and the truth is that I 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:10.000
 I really like to leave a very natural tone of 

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:12.340
 skin lasts a lot the duration is 

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.170
