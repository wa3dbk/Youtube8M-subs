yeah hello it's me again daddy here oh
this<00:00:05.100> one<00:00:05.370> in<00:00:05.549> my<00:00:05.640> bathroom<00:00:05.850> because<00:00:06.180> I<00:00:06.629> found

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:06.810 
this one in my bathroom because I found

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.440 
this one in my bathroom because I found
that<00:00:06.990> this<00:00:07.140> has<00:00:07.200> the<00:00:07.500> best<00:00:07.710> lighting<00:00:08.450> actually

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
that this has the best lighting actually

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.270 
that this has the best lighting actually
sitting<00:00:09.690> on<00:00:09.870> the<00:00:09.990> toilet<00:00:10.200> it's<00:00:10.559> a<00:00:10.710> bit<00:00:10.889> weird

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:11.280 
sitting on the toilet it's a bit weird

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.759 
sitting on the toilet it's a bit weird
but<00:00:11.519> I<00:00:11.880> guess<00:00:12.420> everyone<00:00:12.960> does<00:00:13.200> that<00:00:13.349> makeup<00:00:13.620> in

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
but I guess everyone does that makeup in

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:15.379 
but I guess everyone does that makeup in
the<00:00:13.860> bathroom<00:00:13.889> so<00:00:14.460> it<00:00:14.519> kind<00:00:14.790> of<00:00:14.910> makes<00:00:15.120> sense

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:15.389 
the bathroom so it kind of makes sense

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.870 
the bathroom so it kind of makes sense

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
pretty it's not very pimply so that's

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.990 
pretty it's not very pimply so that's
really<00:01:03.960> good<00:01:04.260> but<00:01:04.559> it<00:01:04.830> does<00:01:05.280> have<00:01:05.549> quite<00:01:05.700> a<00:01:05.790> lot

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
really good but it does have quite a lot

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.780 
really good but it does have quite a lot
of<00:01:06.030> red<00:01:06.240> in<00:01:06.270> it<00:01:06.680> which<00:01:07.680> is<00:01:08.130> really<00:01:08.280> annoying

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
of red in it which is really annoying

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.399 
of red in it which is really annoying
and<00:01:08.939> it's<00:01:09.030> a<00:01:09.090> little<00:01:09.240> black<00:01:09.420> on<00:01:09.600> my<00:01:09.750> arms<00:01:10.200> and

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409

and it's a little black on my arms and
legs<00:01:11.010> I'm<00:01:11.250> just<00:01:11.540> but<00:01:12.540> it's<00:01:12.930> not<00:01:13.080> very<00:01:13.229> nice

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
legs I'm just but it's not very nice

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.230 
legs I'm just but it's not very nice
doesn't<00:01:14.310> look<00:01:14.549> very<00:01:14.580> nice

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
doesn't look very nice

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.399 
doesn't look very nice
um<00:01:15.740> and<00:01:16.740> say<00:01:17.490> this<00:01:18.390> is<00:01:18.659> actually<00:01:18.810> really<00:01:19.290> good

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
um and say this is actually really good

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:22.690 
um and say this is actually really good
for<00:01:19.710> that<00:01:19.890> I<00:01:20.420> find<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.479> coverage<00:01:21.659> on<00:01:22.020> this<00:01:22.229> is

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
for that I find the coverage on this is

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.550 
for that I find the coverage on this is
pretty<00:01:23.700> sheer<00:01:24.210> really<00:01:24.810> and<00:01:25.020> it<00:01:25.110> gets<00:01:25.259> more

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
pretty sheer really and it gets more

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.240 
pretty sheer really and it gets more
sheer<00:01:25.950> really<00:01:26.850> quite<00:01:27.240> fast<00:01:27.479> I<00:01:27.920> find<00:01:28.920> that<00:01:29.100> it

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
sheer really quite fast I find that it

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.330 
sheer really quite fast I find that it
doesn't<00:01:29.520> really<00:01:29.640> last<00:01:30.180> up<00:01:30.600> to<00:01:31.079> 16<00:01:31.470> hours<00:01:31.590> no

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
doesn't really last up to 16 hours no

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.310 
doesn't really last up to 16 hours no
but<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.119> thing<00:01:33.150> is<00:01:33.420> with<00:01:33.600> this<00:01:33.840> I've<00:01:34.259> actually

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
but the thing is with this I've actually

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.490 
but the thing is with this I've actually
realized<00:01:35.250> I<00:01:35.369> don't<00:01:35.460> know<00:01:35.610> whether<00:01:36.079> I'm<00:01:37.079> just

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
realized I don't know whether I'm just

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.859 
realized I don't know whether I'm just
mad<00:01:37.710> but<00:01:38.369> I<00:01:38.610> actually<00:01:38.790> think<00:01:39.150> it's<00:01:39.390> improving

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
mad but I actually think it's improving

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.830 
mad but I actually think it's improving
my<00:01:40.170> skin<00:01:40.700> right<00:01:41.700> before<00:01:42.030> I<00:01:42.060> started<00:01:42.390> using<00:01:42.570> it

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
my skin right before I started using it

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.380 
my skin right before I started using it
I<00:01:43.079> was<00:01:43.259> actually<00:01:43.409> quite<00:01:43.710> pimply<00:01:44.189> and<00:01:44.430> since

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
I was actually quite pimply and since

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.719 
I was actually quite pimply and since
I've<00:01:45.570> been<00:01:45.750> using<00:01:46.049> it<00:01:46.290> I<00:01:46.500> haven't<00:01:46.890> had<00:01:47.070> like

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
I've been using it I haven't had like

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.450 
I've been using it I haven't had like
any<00:01:48.000> pimples<00:01:48.590> so<00:01:49.590> I<00:01:49.619> don't<00:01:50.009> know<00:01:50.100> whether<00:01:50.280> it's

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
any pimples so I don't know whether it's

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.270 
any pimples so I don't know whether it's
because<00:01:50.700> it's<00:01:50.850> more<00:01:51.000> sheer<00:01:51.649> and<00:01:52.649> it<00:01:53.040> doesn't

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
because it's more sheer and it doesn't

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:54.499 
because it's more sheer and it doesn't
really<00:01:53.369> clog<00:01:53.610> up<00:01:53.729> your<00:01:53.880> pores<00:01:54.090> but<00:01:54.270> it<00:01:54.360> does

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
really clog up your pores but it does

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.340 
really clog up your pores but it does
say<00:01:54.750> that<00:01:54.990> it<00:01:55.049> has<00:01:56.540> apricot<00:01:57.540> for<00:01:57.930> radiance

bad<00:02:12.120> I'm<00:02:12.570> sorry<00:02:12.930> but<00:02:13.620> I<00:02:13.890> find<00:02:14.190> that<00:02:14.250> I<00:02:14.400> has

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
bad I'm sorry but I find that I has

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.610 
bad I'm sorry but I find that I has
actually<00:02:15.150> improved<00:02:15.600> my<00:02:15.900> skin<00:02:16.200> and<00:02:16.350> of<00:02:16.440> course

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
actually improved my skin and of course

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.560 
actually improved my skin and of course
it<00:02:16.710> comes<00:02:16.890> in<00:02:17.070> a<00:02:17.130> little<00:02:18.020> scratchy<00:02:19.020> about<00:02:20.570> pump

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:21.570 
it comes in a little scratchy about pump

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:25.100 
it comes in a little scratchy about pump
it's<00:02:22.020> called<00:02:22.260> a<00:02:22.320> pump<00:02:22.560> and<00:02:23.810> that's<00:02:24.810> quite<00:02:25.080> easy

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
it's called a pump and that's quite easy

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:26.810 
it's called a pump and that's quite easy
to<00:02:25.410> use<00:02:25.560> because<00:02:25.950> it<00:02:26.160> doesn't<00:02:26.370> go<00:02:26.460> out<00:02:26.610> too

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:26.820 
to use because it doesn't go out too

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.530 
to use because it doesn't go out too
fast<00:02:27.000> and<00:02:27.420> you<00:02:27.540> can<00:02:27.690> kind<00:02:28.440> of<00:02:28.500> control<00:02:29.070> the

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
fast and you can kind of control the

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:35.210 
fast and you can kind of control the
speed<00:02:31.760> I<00:02:32.760> got<00:02:33.690> from<00:02:34.200> kids<00:02:34.710> I'm<00:02:34.800> from<00:02:34.980> Australia

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
speed I got from kids I'm from Australia

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:40.360 
speed I got from kids I'm from Australia
obviously<00:02:35.910> and<00:02:36.180> I<00:02:36.870> got<00:02:37.140> it<00:02:37.260> from

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.310

two<00:02:48.380> dollars<00:02:49.380> I<00:02:49.830> think<00:02:50.070> I<00:02:50.370> don't<00:02:51.060> know<00:02:51.120> if<00:02:51.240> I'd

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
two dollars I think I don't know if I'd

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:52.910 
two dollars I think I don't know if I'd
buy<00:02:51.510> it<00:02:51.570> again<00:02:51.750> I<00:02:51.990> really<00:02:52.470> want<00:02:52.650> to<00:02:52.710> try<00:02:52.860> the

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
and if I don't like that then I'd

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:57.560 
and if I don't like that then I'd
probably<00:02:56.400> go<00:02:56.700> back<00:02:56.820> to<00:02:57.000> these<00:02:57.150> coz<00:02:57.420> I<00:02:57.540> don't

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:57.570 
probably go back to these coz I don't

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:59.810 
probably go back to these coz I don't
hate<00:02:57.930> it<00:02:57.960> but<00:02:58.830> I<00:02:58.890> just<00:02:59.100> find<00:02:59.280> that<00:02:59.430> it<00:02:59.550> doesn't

then when you rub it on it kind of turns
powdery<00:03:29.520> but<00:03:29.790> I<00:03:30.300> really<00:03:30.960> like<00:03:31.170> it<00:03:31.200> like<00:03:32.810> gives

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:33.810 
powdery but I really like it like gives

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:35.900 
powdery but I really like it like gives
me<00:03:33.900> a<00:03:34.020> really<00:03:34.500> good<00:03:34.950> coverage<00:03:35.460> it's<00:03:35.730> quite

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:35.910 
me a really good coverage it's quite

00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.780 
me a really good coverage it's quite
fake<00:03:36.710> until<00:03:37.710> it<00:03:37.830> let<00:03:38.010> skin<00:03:38.340> breathe<00:03:38.610> and

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
fake until it let skin breathe and

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.340 
fake until it let skin breathe and
maintains<00:03:39.180> the<00:03:39.330> central<00:03:39.660> hydration<00:03:40.140> which<00:03:40.260> i

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.350 
maintains the central hydration which i

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:42.080 
maintains the central hydration which i
think<00:03:40.410> is<00:03:40.770> pretty<00:03:41.010> true<00:03:41.340> because<00:03:41.670> whenever<00:03:41.880> I

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 
think is pretty true because whenever I

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.060 
think is pretty true because whenever I
use<00:03:42.330> it<00:03:42.480> I<00:03:42.510> don't<00:03:42.600> tend<00:03:43.020> to<00:03:43.080> break<00:03:43.350> out<00:03:43.590> I

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:44.070 
use it I don't tend to break out I

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:47.930 
use it I don't tend to break out I
really<00:03:44.550> do<00:03:44.670> like<00:03:44.820> this<00:03:46.220> even<00:03:47.220> sometimes<00:03:47.550> I<00:03:47.790> eat

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:47.940 
really do like this even sometimes I eat

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.310 
really do like this even sometimes I eat
my<00:03:48.090> healthy<00:03:48.390> mix<00:03:48.570> foundation<00:03:48.630> and<00:03:49.170> then<00:03:49.290> I

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:49.320 
my healthy mix foundation and then I

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.290 
my healthy mix foundation and then I
just<00:03:49.590> put<00:03:49.770> this<00:03:49.920> over<00:03:50.280> the<00:03:50.370> areas<00:03:50.760> that<00:03:50.790> I

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:51.300 
just put this over the areas that I

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:54.050 
just put this over the areas that I
thought<00:03:52.140> its<00:03:52.440> donated<00:03:52.950> some<00:03:53.160> coverage<00:03:53.550> yeah

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
thought its donated some coverage yeah

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:55.040 
thought its donated some coverage yeah
that's<00:03:54.270> pretty<00:03:54.360> much<00:03:54.480> what<00:03:54.570> I<00:03:54.720> have<00:03:54.840> to<00:03:54.930> say

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:55.050 
that's pretty much what I have to say

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:56.960 
that's pretty much what I have to say
generally<00:03:55.410> I'm<00:03:55.560> pretty<00:03:55.740> happy<00:03:55.890> with<00:03:56.160> look

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:56.970
