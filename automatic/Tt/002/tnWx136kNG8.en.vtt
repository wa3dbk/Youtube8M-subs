00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:06.190 
before and after sense I don't of before

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.350 
before and after sense I don't of before
and<00:03:06.280> after<00:03:06.460> because<00:03:06.670> I<00:03:06.760> don't<00:03:07.000> have<00:03:07.210> a

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
and after because I don't have a

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.730 
and after because I don't have a
measuring<00:03:10.360> tape<00:03:10.690> to<00:03:10.870> actually<00:03:11.200> measure<00:03:11.410> so<00:03:11.710> I

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:11.740 
measuring tape to actually measure so I

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:18.090 
measuring tape to actually measure so I
just<00:03:11.950> have<00:03:12.070> like<00:03:14.790> the<00:03:15.790> guess<00:03:16.200> so<00:03:17.200> but<00:03:17.440> I<00:03:17.590> mean<00:03:17.860> I

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:18.100 
just have like the guess so but I mean I

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.370 
just have like the guess so but I mean I
probably<00:03:18.610> just<00:03:18.910> will<00:03:19.240> put<00:03:19.480> on<00:03:19.660> the<00:03:19.840> same<00:03:20.050> shirt

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:20.380 
probably just will put on the same shirt

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:25.590 
probably just will put on the same shirt
so<00:03:20.950> I<00:03:20.980> has<00:03:21.250> like<00:03:21.520> the<00:03:21.670> same<00:03:24.030> measurements<00:03:25.030> kind

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:25.600
