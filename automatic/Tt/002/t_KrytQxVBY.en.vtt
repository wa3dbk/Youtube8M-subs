doing this the hard way to show you guys
just<00:00:09.870> exactly<00:00:10.610> how<00:00:11.610> to<00:00:11.670> wire<00:00:12.120> lights<00:00:12.870> or

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
just exactly how to wire lights or

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:14.690 
just exactly how to wire lights or
whatever<00:00:13.349> else<00:00:13.710> you<00:00:13.799> want<00:00:13.980> into<00:00:14.250> the<00:00:14.340> factory

up<00:00:14.820> fitter<00:00:15.059> switches<00:00:15.480> because<00:00:15.630> I<00:00:15.780> had<00:00:16.049> a<00:00:16.080> hell

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
up fitter switches because I had a hell

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.700 
up fitter switches because I had a hell
of<00:00:16.529> a<00:00:16.770> time<00:00:16.920> trying<00:00:17.160> to<00:00:17.310> figure<00:00:17.550> it<00:00:17.580> out<00:00:17.730> myself

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:18.710 
of a time trying to figure it out myself

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:20.630 
of a time trying to figure it out myself
as<00:00:19.710> you<00:00:19.830> can<00:00:19.920> see<00:00:20.010> I've<00:00:20.100> got<00:00:20.220> these<00:00:20.340> rigid

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
as you can see I've got these rigid

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.810 
as you can see I've got these rigid
oracles<00:00:21.029> up<00:00:21.180> here<00:00:21.390> and<00:00:22.340> I've<00:00:23.340> got<00:00:23.369> a<00:00:23.519> rigid

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
oracles up here and I've got a rigid

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:31.060 
oracles up here and I've got a rigid
light<00:00:24.000> bar<00:00:24.210> on<00:00:24.240> top<00:00:27.050> now<00:00:28.050> what<00:00:28.680> I<00:00:28.740> did<00:00:28.920> here<00:00:29.130> was

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:31.070 
light bar on top now what I did here was

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:34.069 
light bar on top now what I did here was
ran<00:00:32.070> all<00:00:32.279> these<00:00:32.460> off<00:00:32.700> the<00:00:32.820> same<00:00:33.030> line<00:00:33.300> because

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
ran all these off the same line because

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.959 
ran all these off the same line because
you<00:00:34.230> know<00:00:34.320> they<00:00:34.469> are<00:00:34.500> LEDs<00:00:35.010> so<00:00:35.670> they<00:00:35.790> should

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
you know they are LEDs so they should

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.760 
you know they are LEDs so they should
dress<00:00:36.239> fairly<00:00:36.870> small<00:00:37.079> amount<00:00:37.140> of<00:00:37.440> voltage

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:37.770 
dress fairly small amount of voltage

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.639 
dress fairly small amount of voltage
nothing<00:00:38.070> too<00:00:38.190> much<00:00:39.079> ran<00:00:40.079> them<00:00:40.230> all<00:00:40.379> off<00:00:40.500> the

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
nothing too much ran them all off the

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:43.310 
nothing too much ran them all off the
same<00:00:40.860> ground<00:00:41.160> and<00:00:41.489> same<00:00:42.000> positive<00:00:42.239> wire<00:00:42.719> all

wires through the firewall come in
you're<00:02:15.960> gonna<00:02:16.050> have<00:02:16.140> to<00:02:16.320> find<00:02:16.560> which<00:02:16.770> wires

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:17.070 
you're gonna have to find which wires

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.790 
you're gonna have to find which wires
are<00:02:17.340> which<00:02:17.550> coming<00:02:18.240> from<00:02:18.360> the<00:02:18.450> firewall<00:02:18.960> and<00:02:19.200> I

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
are which coming from the firewall and I

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.010 
are which coming from the firewall and I
highly<00:02:20.490> highly<00:02:20.520> recommend<00:02:20.850> a<00:02:21.300> voltage<00:02:21.570> tester

highly highly recommend a voltage tester
to<00:02:22.110> figure<00:02:22.290> this<00:02:22.380> out<00:02:22.590> you<00:02:23.160> clip<00:02:23.370> the<00:02:23.490> pigtails

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
to figure this out you clip the pigtails

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.250 
to figure this out you clip the pigtails
and<00:02:24.360> then<00:02:24.750> simply<00:02:26.090> match<00:02:27.090> up<00:02:27.420> whichever<00:02:27.990> ones

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
and then simply match up whichever ones

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.650 
and then simply match up whichever ones
go<00:02:28.440> to<00:02:28.500> which<00:02:28.680> ones<00:02:28.890> you<00:02:28.980> want<00:02:29.130> so<00:02:30.060> for<00:02:30.270> example

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:30.660 
go to which ones you want so for example

wired into my auxilary one and I've got

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.470 
wired into my auxilary one and I've got
my<00:02:38.720> Oracle's<00:02:39.720> wired<00:02:39.959> into<00:02:40.200> auxilary<00:02:40.530> two<00:02:40.800> here

my Oracle's wired into auxilary two here

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:42.920 
my Oracle's wired into auxilary two here
see<00:02:42.480> how<00:02:42.540> it<00:02:42.660> works

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
see how it works

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:45.770 
see how it works
just<00:02:43.380> pull<00:02:44.220> the<00:02:44.250> wires<00:02:44.489> from<00:02:44.670> this<00:02:44.910> match<00:02:45.600> them

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
just pull the wires from this match them

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:52.180 
just pull the wires from this match them
up<00:02:45.870> to<00:02:45.930> these<00:02:46.230> four<00:02:47.480> you<00:02:48.480> don't<00:02:48.510> need<00:02:48.870> to<00:02:48.989> run<00:02:49.200> a

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:54.199 

you<00:02:53.190> don't<00:02:53.280> need<00:02:53.400> to<00:02:53.550> run<00:02:53.700> a<00:02:53.730> power<00:02:53.910> wire<00:02:54.180> to

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
you don't need to run a power wire to

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:57.790 
you don't need to run a power wire to
the<00:02:54.450> battery<00:02:54.600> because<00:02:55.590> as<00:02:56.239> awesome<00:02:57.239> as<00:02:57.450> this

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:57.800 
the battery because as awesome as this

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:03.360 
the battery because as awesome as this
Ford's<00:02:58.800> wired<00:02:59.310> these<00:02:59.550> things<00:02:59.790> to<00:02:59.940> be<00:03:00.030> hot

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:03.370 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:04.920 

so<00:03:03.970> basically<00:03:04.239> you<00:03:04.360> don't<00:03:04.390> have<00:03:04.569> to<00:03:04.750> run<00:03:04.900> a

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:04.930 
so basically you don't have to run a

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.070 
so basically you don't have to run a
dead<00:03:05.140> kid<00:03:05.790> dedicated<00:03:06.790> switch<00:03:06.970> wire<00:03:07.180> you<00:03:07.930> only

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:08.080 
dead kid dedicated switch wire you only

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.670 
dead kid dedicated switch wire you only
got<00:03:08.230> a<00:03:08.260> hot<00:03:08.470> and<00:03:08.680> a<00:03:09.459> negative<00:03:09.989> so<00:03:10.989> got<00:03:11.379> my<00:03:11.470> god

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
got a hot and a negative so got my god

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:12.750 
got a hot and a negative so got my god
I'm<00:03:11.769> grounded<00:03:12.069> right<00:03:12.220> here<00:03:12.370> like<00:03:12.519> I<00:03:12.640> showed

only wiring you have two here on you
only<00:03:16.900> have<00:03:17.140> to<00:03:17.230> run<00:03:17.410> the<00:03:17.860> hot<00:03:18.040> to<00:03:18.400> the<00:03:18.519> key<00:03:18.670> to

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:19.000 
only have to run the hot to the key to

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.009 
only have to run the hot to the key to
the<00:03:19.120> switch<00:03:20.049> and<00:03:20.290> the<00:03:20.830> negative<00:03:21.160> ground

00:03:22.009 --> 00:03:22.019 
the switch and the negative ground

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:26.730 
the switch and the negative ground
that's<00:03:23.019> it<00:03:23.290> it's<00:03:23.739> easy<00:03:23.980> once<00:03:24.190> figure<00:03:24.489> it<00:03:24.580> out
