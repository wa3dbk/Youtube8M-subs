not<00:01:17.380> 355<00:01:18.380> it's<00:01:18.740> not<00:01:18.950> enough<00:01:19.190> you<00:01:19.340> have<00:01:19.369> to<00:01:19.610> go

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:19.729 
not 355 it's not enough you have to go

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:26.620 
not 355 it's not enough you have to go
360<00:01:20.060> around<00:01:22.810> so<00:01:23.810> first<00:01:24.440> it<00:01:24.820> starts<00:01:25.820> with<00:01:25.850> 360

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:26.630 
360 around so first it starts with 360

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:28.840 
360 around so first it starts with 360
around<00:01:26.690> the<00:01:26.960> world<00:01:27.170> but<00:01:28.009> the<00:01:28.430> other<00:01:28.550> food

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:28.850 
around the world but the other food

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:30.730 
around the world but the other food
comes<00:01:29.119> at<00:01:29.270> the<00:01:29.360> same<00:01:29.540> time<00:01:29.869> so<00:01:30.350> it<00:01:30.470> looks<00:01:30.649> like

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 
comes at the same time so it looks like

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:38.260 
comes at the same time so it looks like
this<00:01:35.259> it's<00:01:36.259> very<00:01:36.440> important<00:01:36.979> that<00:01:37.280> you<00:01:37.430> do<00:01:38.090> the

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
this it's very important that you do the

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:39.700 
this it's very important that you do the
revolutions<00:01:38.930> at<00:01:39.140> once

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
revolutions at once

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:48.900 
revolutions at once
not<00:01:39.979> like<00:01:40.160> separately

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:48.910 

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:51.940 

so<00:01:49.910> the<00:01:50.450> first<00:01:50.690> start<00:01:50.990> is<00:01:51.170> very<00:01:51.230> important

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
so the first start is very important

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:54.370 
so the first start is very important
when<00:01:52.490> you<00:01:52.580> set<00:01:52.790> the<00:01:52.910> ball<00:01:53.090> up<00:01:53.300> in<00:01:53.480> the<00:01:53.510> air<00:01:53.600> you
