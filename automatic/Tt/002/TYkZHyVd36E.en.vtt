00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
what is actually on this animatronics

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:14.740 
what is actually on this animatronics
hat<00:00:12.570> if<00:00:12.840> we<00:00:13.049> actually<00:00:13.200> look<00:00:13.620> at<00:00:13.769> it<00:00:13.860> closely

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:14.750 
hat if we actually look at it closely

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:17.450 
hat if we actually look at it closely
now<00:00:15.750> if<00:00:16.379> you<00:00:16.529> actually<00:00:16.680> look<00:00:16.980> on<00:00:17.100> the<00:00:17.250> left

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
now if you actually look on the left

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.609 
now if you actually look on the left
side<00:00:17.699> of<00:00:17.940> the<00:00:18.090> Hat<00:00:18.330> and<00:00:18.779> you<00:00:18.900> zoom<00:00:19.109> in<00:00:19.350> or<00:00:19.470> you

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
side of the Hat and you zoom in or you

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.820 
side of the Hat and you zoom in or you
lighten<00:00:20.100> it<00:00:20.220> up<00:00:20.340> you<00:00:20.850> see<00:00:21.060> the<00:00:21.210> inscription<00:00:21.830> C

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
lighten it up you see the inscription C

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.870 
lighten it up you see the inscription C
D<00:00:23.820> which<00:00:24.660> I<00:00:24.840> honestly<00:00:25.380> have<00:00:25.619> no<00:00:25.650> idea<00:00:26.460> what<00:00:26.730> it

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
D which I honestly have no idea what it

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.759 
D which I honestly have no idea what it
could<00:00:27.119> be<00:00:27.359> but<00:00:27.630> if<00:00:28.019> you<00:00:28.109> actually<00:00:28.260> look<00:00:28.410> even

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
could be but if you actually look even

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.589 
could be but if you actually look even
more<00:00:28.949> closely<00:00:29.279> looks<00:00:29.820> like<00:00:30.029> something<00:00:30.420> is

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
more closely looks like something is

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.450 
more closely looks like something is
actually<00:00:30.750> underneath<00:00:31.439> that<00:00:31.949> but<00:00:32.189> has<00:00:32.279> been

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:32.460 
actually underneath that but has been

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.650 
actually underneath that but has been
wiped<00:00:33.120> off<00:00:33.360> and<00:00:33.840> C<00:00:34.500> D<00:00:34.890> has<00:00:35.340> been<00:00:35.370> added<00:00:36.120> to<00:00:36.450> it

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
wiped off and C D has been added to it

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.690 
wiped off and C D has been added to it
whether<00:00:37.110> or<00:00:37.320> not<00:00:37.500> that<00:00:37.680> is<00:00:37.829> true<00:00:38.129> or<00:00:38.309> not<00:00:38.520> it

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
whether or not that is true or not it

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.479 
whether or not that is true or not it
still<00:00:38.850> remains<00:00:39.360> the<00:00:39.600> fact<00:00:39.840> that<00:00:39.989> this<00:00:40.649> C<00:00:41.100> D

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
still remains the fact that this C D

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.740 
still remains the fact that this C D
looks<00:00:42.149> like<00:00:42.360> it's<00:00:42.600> been<00:00:42.809> written<00:00:43.050> down<00:00:43.440> or

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:44.750 
looks like it's been written down or

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:47.840 
looks like it's been written down or
scripted<00:00:45.750> on<00:00:45.899> top<00:00:46.140> of<00:00:46.320> this<00:00:46.829> animatronics<00:00:47.550> hat

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
scripted on top of this animatronics hat

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:51.770 
scripted on top of this animatronics hat
so<00:00:48.690> um<00:00:49.309> what<00:00:50.309> I<00:00:50.340> want<00:00:50.640> you<00:00:50.820> guys<00:00:51.030> to<00:00:51.090> do<00:00:51.539> is

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
think about what this CD could be I have

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.619 
think about what this CD could be I have
been<00:00:55.079> researching<00:00:55.680> for<00:00:56.309> hours<00:00:56.820> and<00:00:57.030> hours<00:00:57.510> on

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
been researching for hours and hours on

00:00:57.629 --> 00:01:00.290 
been researching for hours and hours on
both<00:00:58.020> game<00:00:58.410> files<00:00:58.800> and<00:00:59.250> if<00:00:59.789> I<00:00:59.940> can<00:01:00.120> find

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
both game files and if I can find

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.349 
both game files and if I can find
anything<00:01:00.960> to<00:01:01.140> do<00:01:01.350> with<00:01:01.379> C<00:01:02.010> D<00:01:02.399> but<00:01:02.940> I<00:01:02.969> honestly

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
anything to do with C D but I honestly

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.109 
anything to do with C D but I honestly
don't<00:01:04.290> but<00:01:04.799> I<00:01:04.830> still<00:01:05.220> have<00:01:05.519> come<00:01:05.760> up<00:01:05.880> with<00:01:06.090> a

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
don't but I still have come up with a

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:09.280 
don't but I still have come up with a
few<00:01:06.390> theories<00:01:06.750> on<00:01:07.110> what<00:01:07.229> C<00:01:07.590> D<00:01:07.860> could<00:01:08.159> be

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:09.290 
few theories on what C D could be

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.039 
few theories on what C D could be
possibly<00:01:10.290> C<00:01:10.680> D<00:01:11.100> could<00:01:11.700> be<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:12.000> initials<00:01:12.720> of

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
possibly C D could be the initials of

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.679 
possibly C D could be the initials of
someone<00:01:13.680> for<00:01:14.280> example<00:01:14.790> my<00:01:15.030> name's<00:01:15.360> Louis

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
someone for example my name's Louis

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:19.160 
someone for example my name's Louis
Dawkins<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:16.650> mine<00:01:16.860> would<00:01:17.070> be<00:01:17.250> LD<00:01:18.000> it<00:01:18.540> could<00:01:18.990> be

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
Dawkins the mine would be LD it could be

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.950 
Dawkins the mine would be LD it could be
many<00:01:19.590> possibilities<00:01:20.369> as<00:01:20.490> well<00:01:20.520> Mike<00:01:21.390> Schmitt

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
many possibilities as well Mike Schmitt

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.950 
many possibilities as well Mike Schmitt
would<00:01:22.439> be<00:01:22.619> M<00:01:22.830> s<00:01:23.280> there<00:01:24.180> you<00:01:24.330> go<00:01:24.509> that's<00:01:24.750> what

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
would be M s there you go that's what

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.840 
would be M s there you go that's what
I'm<00:01:25.080> trying<00:01:25.350> to<00:01:25.439> say<00:01:25.740> here<00:01:26.130> so<00:01:26.280> it<00:01:26.670> could<00:01:26.820> be

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
I'm trying to say here so it could be

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:18.390 
marionette they haven't got an

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:21.380 
marionette they haven't got an
inscription<00:02:18.900> on<00:02:19.290> it<00:02:19.500> to<00:02:19.680> say<00:02:19.890> who<00:02:20.489> made<00:02:20.849> it<00:02:21.180> or

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
inscription on it to say who made it or

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.170 
inscription on it to say who made it or
why<00:02:22.260> it<00:02:22.319> would<00:02:22.590> be<00:02:22.620> there<00:02:22.769> it<00:02:23.670> doesn't<00:02:24.060> make

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 
why it would be there it doesn't make

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.929 
why it would be there it doesn't make
any<00:02:24.360> sense<00:02:24.659> to<00:02:24.930> me<00:02:25.079> so<00:02:25.409> as<00:02:25.680> I<00:02:25.920> said<00:02:26.129> earlier<00:02:26.519> it

00:02:26.929 --> 00:02:26.939 
any sense to me so as I said earlier it

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:29.470 
any sense to me so as I said earlier it
could<00:02:27.420> be<00:02:27.599> just<00:02:27.840> somebody's<00:02:28.409> Richie<00:02:28.739> on<00:02:29.069> there

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:29.480 
could be just somebody's Richie on there

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.880 
could be just somebody's Richie on there
but<00:02:30.480> to<00:02:30.569> be<00:02:30.690> honest<00:02:30.959> if<00:02:31.079> somebody<00:02:31.409> did<00:02:31.650> write

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
but to be honest if somebody did write

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:33.710 
but to be honest if somebody did write
it<00:02:32.159> on<00:02:32.280> now<00:02:32.489> I<00:02:32.640> don't<00:02:32.879> think<00:02:33.120> we<00:02:33.239> would<00:02:33.450> be<00:02:33.480> able

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
it on now I don't think we would be able

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:37.280 
it on now I don't think we would be able
to<00:02:34.049> see<00:02:34.319> it<00:02:34.500> this<00:02:34.590> big<00:02:35.129> the<00:02:35.849> the<00:02:36.290> initials

themselves are very the look very deep
they<00:02:40.440> look<00:02:40.620> really<00:02:41.129> deep<00:02:41.489> inside<00:02:42.299> the<00:02:42.569> heart

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
not just CD and if you actually look to

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.190 
not just CD and if you actually look to
the<00:02:58.920> right<00:02:59.129> of<00:02:59.430> CD<00:03:00.030> people<00:03:00.810> are<00:03:00.930> saying

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:01.200

the right of CD people are saying
including<00:03:01.889> myself<00:03:02.040> to<00:03:02.489> be<00:03:02.609> honest<00:03:02.970> that<00:03:03.540> it

00:03:03.649 --> 00:03:03.659 
including myself to be honest that it

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:05.830 
including myself to be honest that it
could<00:03:03.930> then<00:03:04.349> it<00:03:04.470> looks<00:03:04.680> like<00:03:04.799> it's<00:03:05.129> saying<00:03:05.370> joy

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
could then it looks like it's saying joy

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.270 
could then it looks like it's saying joy
it<00:03:06.840> could<00:03:07.049> be<00:03:07.170> saying<00:03:07.409> joy<00:03:07.769> it<00:03:07.980> could<00:03:08.129> be

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:08.280 
it could be saying joy it could be

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.610 
it could be saying joy it could be
saying<00:03:08.489> toy<00:03:08.849> like<00:03:09.239> the<00:03:09.389> toy<00:03:09.569> animatronics<00:03:09.959> it

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
saying toy like the toy animatronics it

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.059 
saying toy like the toy animatronics it
could<00:03:10.950> be<00:03:11.099> saying<00:03:11.400> boy<00:03:11.780> but<00:03:12.780> to<00:03:13.349> be<00:03:13.500> honest<00:03:13.859> I

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:14.069 
could be saying boy but to be honest I

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:15.770 
could be saying boy but to be honest I
don't<00:03:14.159> really<00:03:14.549> know<00:03:14.879> what<00:03:15.060> this<00:03:15.239> could<00:03:15.540> be

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
don't really know what this could be

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:18.680 
don't really know what this could be
maybe<00:03:16.230> it's<00:03:16.530> just<00:03:16.739> them<00:03:17.129> the<00:03:17.849> pattern<00:03:18.239> is<00:03:18.389> used

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
maybe it's just them the pattern is used

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:20.869 
maybe it's just them the pattern is used
for<00:03:18.989> the<00:03:19.049> Hat<00:03:19.290> and<00:03:19.769> to<00:03:20.190> be<00:03:20.310> honest<00:03:20.609> it's<00:03:20.790> the

00:03:20.869 --> 00:03:20.879 
for the Hat and to be honest it's the

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:23.270 
for the Hat and to be honest it's the
same<00:03:21.150> pattern<00:03:21.449> and<00:03:21.900> from<00:03:22.739> the<00:03:22.859> other<00:03:23.099> toy

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280 
same pattern and from the other toy

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:26.659 
same pattern and from the other toy
animatronics<00:03:23.760> that<00:03:24.209> plastic<00:03:25.049> em<00:03:25.260> look<00:03:25.919> which

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:26.669 
animatronics that plastic em look which

00:03:26.669 --> 00:03:28.729 
animatronics that plastic em look which
Scots<00:03:27.030> used<00:03:27.329> before<00:03:27.780> if<00:03:28.199> you<00:03:28.349> look<00:03:28.500> at<00:03:28.650> the

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
Scots used before if you look at the

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:31.009 
Scots used before if you look at the
marionette<00:03:29.370> and<00:03:29.609> these<00:03:30.269> are<00:03:30.449> all<00:03:30.599> made<00:03:30.810> out<00:03:30.840> of

00:03:31.009 --> 00:03:31.019 
marionette and these are all made out of

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:33.349 
marionette and these are all made out of
a<00:03:31.169> plastic<00:03:31.319> material<00:03:31.739> probably<00:03:32.699> and<00:03:32.910> they've

00:03:33.349 --> 00:03:33.359 
a plastic material probably and they've

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:36.589 
a plastic material probably and they've
all<00:03:33.510> got<00:03:33.720> the<00:03:33.870> same<00:03:34.109> and<00:03:34.530> the<00:03:35.459> same<00:03:35.699> pattern<00:03:36.090> on

00:03:36.589 --> 00:03:36.599 
all got the same and the same pattern on

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:38.780 
all got the same and the same pattern on
them<00:03:37.019> where<00:03:37.590> it's<00:03:37.769> always<00:03:38.010> like<00:03:38.400> blurry

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
them where it's always like blurry

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.449 
them where it's always like blurry
pattern<00:03:39.480> and<00:03:39.720> maybe<00:03:40.199> it's<00:03:40.500> just<00:03:40.680> that<00:03:41.040> on<00:03:41.310> the

00:03:41.449 --> 00:03:41.459 
pattern and maybe it's just that on the

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:42.890 
pattern and maybe it's just that on the
hat<00:03:41.669> maybe<00:03:41.970> it<00:03:42.150> doesn't<00:03:42.329> actually<00:03:42.480> mean

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:42.900 
hat maybe it doesn't actually mean

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.400 
hat maybe it doesn't actually mean
something<00:03:43.310> but<00:03:44.310> if<00:03:44.430> it<00:03:44.639> did<00:03:44.940> once<00:03:45.629> again<00:03:46.169> I

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
something but if it did once again I

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:48.500 
something but if it did once again I
don't<00:03:46.889> really<00:03:47.099> think<00:03:47.190> it<00:03:47.549> would<00:03:47.699> be<00:03:47.910> on<00:03:48.150> there

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:48.510 
don't really think it would be on there

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:51.080 
don't really think it would be on there
originally<00:03:48.870> and<00:03:49.530> because<00:03:50.459> we<00:03:50.609> haven't<00:03:50.879> seen

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:51.090 
originally and because we haven't seen

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:53.900 
originally and because we haven't seen
this<00:03:51.239> on<00:03:51.449> balloon<00:03:51.810> boys<00:03:52.139> hat<00:03:52.470> they<00:03:52.739> send<00:03:53.099> the

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
this on balloon boys hat they send the

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.449 
this on balloon boys hat they send the
name<00:03:54.150> of<00:03:54.480> it<00:03:54.629> you<00:03:54.810> know<00:03:54.989> but<00:03:55.709> the<00:03:55.769> thing<00:03:55.799> is<00:03:55.980> joy

00:03:56.449 --> 00:03:56.459 
name of it you know but the thing is joy

00:03:56.459 --> 00:03:59.300 
name of it you know but the thing is joy
could<00:03:56.819> be<00:03:56.940> to<00:03:57.120> do<00:03:57.239> with<00:03:57.269> JJ<00:03:58.139> it<00:03:58.739> could<00:03:58.980> be<00:03:59.129> like

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
could be to do with JJ it could be like

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:01.550 
could be to do with JJ it could be like
juggling<00:04:00.030> joy<00:04:00.299> or<00:04:00.510> something<00:04:00.959> like<00:04:01.079> that<00:04:01.139> you

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:01.560 
juggling joy or something like that you

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:03.770 
juggling joy or something like that you
see<00:04:01.709> what<00:04:01.829> I'm<00:04:01.919> trying<00:04:02.159> to<00:04:02.220> say<00:04:02.459> here<00:04:02.879> and<00:04:03.060> I

don't really think it was an originally
put<00:04:05.879> on<00:04:06.030> there<00:04:06.299> maybe<00:04:06.870> it's<00:04:07.139> just<00:04:07.260> something

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
put on there maybe it's just something

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:10.159 
put on there maybe it's just something

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:17.360 
saying it can't be like they're in the
game<00:04:15.180> because<00:04:15.569> that<00:04:15.750> would<00:04:15.930> be<00:04:16.079> strange<00:04:16.440> but

joy for its name JJ or it could to do
with<00:04:22.139> joy<00:04:22.500> as<00:04:22.860> joy<00:04:23.400> of<00:04:23.610> creation<00:04:24.060> which<00:04:24.840> a<00:04:24.960> lot

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
with joy as joy of creation which a lot

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.220 
with joy as joy of creation which a lot
of<00:04:25.200> people<00:04:25.500> are<00:04:25.620> saying<00:04:25.800> as<00:04:26.070> well<00:04:26.310> but<00:04:26.969> what

you<00:04:32.900> guys<00:04:33.050> to<00:04:33.110> think<00:04:33.350> about<00:04:33.770> what<00:04:34.730> joy<00:04:35.450> or<00:04:35.810> toy

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:36.290 
you guys to think about what joy or toy

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:38.590 
you guys to think about what joy or toy
or<00:04:36.620> boy<00:04:36.890> could<00:04:37.190> actually<00:04:37.340> mean<00:04:37.730> with<00:04:38.000> this

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:38.600 
or boy could actually mean with this

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:41.290 
or boy could actually mean with this
animatronic<00:04:39.220> obviously<00:04:40.220> boy<00:04:40.430> would<00:04:40.730> be<00:04:40.760> to<00:04:41.150> do

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:41.300 
animatronic obviously boy would be to do

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.750 
animatronic obviously boy would be to do
with<00:04:41.480> balloon<00:04:41.840> boy<00:04:42.110> and<00:04:42.440> toy<00:04:42.950> would<00:04:43.220> to<00:04:43.340> do<00:04:43.490> B

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:43.760 
with balloon boy and toy would to do B

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:46.000 
with balloon boy and toy would to do B
toy<00:04:44.180> would<00:04:44.450> would<00:04:45.020> be<00:04:45.230> to<00:04:45.380> do<00:04:45.530> with<00:04:45.680> the<00:04:45.830> toy

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:46.010 
toy would would be to do with the toy

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:48.880 
toy would would be to do with the toy
animatronics<00:04:46.430> and<00:04:46.970> joy<00:04:47.660> could<00:04:47.930> mean<00:04:48.110> JJ<00:04:48.680> or

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:48.890 
animatronics and joy could mean JJ or

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:52.150 
animatronics and joy could mean JJ or
joy<00:04:49.160> of<00:04:49.370> creation<00:04:49.960> but<00:04:50.960> it's<00:04:51.230> quite<00:04:51.620> weird<00:04:51.860> to

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:52.160 
joy of creation but it's quite weird to

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.070 
joy of creation but it's quite weird to
me<00:04:52.340> I<00:04:52.550> really<00:04:53.180> don't<00:04:53.450> know<00:04:53.630> what<00:04:53.870> this<00:04:54.020> could

your<00:05:07.790> boy<00:05:08.120> on<00:05:08.390> the<00:05:08.720> right<00:05:08.900> of<00:05:09.080> C<00:05:09.350> D<00:05:09.530> actually

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:09.710 
your boy on the right of C D actually

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:10.810 
your boy on the right of C D actually
means<00:05:10.130> something

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:10.820 
means something

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:13.450 
means something
once<00:05:11.240> God's<00:05:11.540> intended<00:05:12.020> to<00:05:12.320> put<00:05:12.530> on<00:05:12.680> E<00:05:12.950> or<00:05:13.040> is<00:05:13.430> it

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:13.460 
once God's intended to put on E or is it

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:15.460 
once God's intended to put on E or is it
just<00:05:13.580> the<00:05:13.880> pattern<00:05:14.150> of<00:05:14.510> the<00:05:14.630> plastic<00:05:15.170> of<00:05:15.320> its

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:15.470 
just the pattern of the plastic of its

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:18.310 
just the pattern of the plastic of its
hat<00:05:15.710> which<00:05:16.160> we've<00:05:16.400> seen<00:05:16.610> in<00:05:16.850> the<00:05:17.240> old<00:05:17.450> and<00:05:17.780> toy

00:05:18.310 --> 00:05:18.320 
hat which we've seen in the old and toy

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:20.950 
hat which we've seen in the old and toy
animatronics<00:05:18.740> as<00:05:19.310> well<00:05:19.520> but<00:05:20.390> for<00:05:20.690> the<00:05:20.750> first

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:20.960 
animatronics as well but for the first

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:22.780 
animatronics as well but for the first
time<00:05:21.110> guys<00:05:21.530> I<00:05:21.560> don't<00:05:21.920> know<00:05:22.220> what<00:05:22.520> it<00:05:22.640> could

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:22.790 
time guys I don't know what it could

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:24.250 
time guys I don't know what it could
mean<00:05:22.820> I've<00:05:23.180> tried<00:05:23.540> to<00:05:23.660> come<00:05:23.780> up<00:05:23.840> with<00:05:24.020> some

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:24.260 
mean I've tried to come up with some

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:26.650 
mean I've tried to come up with some
theories<00:05:24.680> for<00:05:24.830> you<00:05:24.950> guys<00:05:25.160> to<00:05:25.400> think<00:05:25.580> about<00:05:25.790> but

00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:26.660 
theories for you guys to think about but

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:29.650 
theories for you guys to think about but
those<00:05:26.930> are<00:05:27.410> just<00:05:27.470> theories<00:05:28.010> about<00:05:28.490> what<00:05:28.700> MC<00:05:29.420> D

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:29.660 
those are just theories about what MC D

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:33.730 
those are just theories about what MC D
could<00:05:29.870> mean<00:05:30.170> I<00:05:30.530> don't<00:05:31.490> know<00:05:31.760> what<00:05:32.300> C<00:05:32.630> D<00:05:32.930> is<00:05:33.200> and

00:05:33.730 --> 00:05:33.740 
could mean I don't know what C D is and

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:48.670 
or maybe we'll get another teaser as
well<00:05:46.400> from<00:05:47.180> I<00:05:47.540> don't<00:05:47.840> know<00:05:47.930> another<00:05:48.290> old

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:48.680 
well from I don't know another old

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:52.510 
well from I don't know another old
animatronic<00:05:49.430> maybe<00:05:49.880> and<00:05:50.060> we'll<00:05:50.570> see<00:05:51.130> CD<00:05:52.130> again

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:52.520

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:56.110 
animatronic maybe and we'll see CD again
if<00:05:52.790> we<00:05:52.940> don't<00:05:53.120> see<00:05:53.390> CD<00:05:53.930> again<00:05:54.320> I<00:05:54.880> don't<00:05:55.880> know

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:56.120 
if we don't see CD again I don't know

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:59.020 
if we don't see CD again I don't know
maybe<00:05:56.840> it<00:05:57.110> didn't<00:05:57.380> mean<00:05:57.530> anything<00:05:57.560> at<00:05:58.220> all<00:05:58.370> but

00:05:59.020 --> 00:05:59.030 
maybe it didn't mean anything at all but

00:05:59.030 --> 00:06:00.760 
maybe it didn't mean anything at all but
it's<00:05:59.150> still<00:05:59.360> interesting<00:06:00.020> to<00:06:00.050> think<00:06:00.380> about

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:00.770 
it's still interesting to think about

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:04.150 
it's still interesting to think about
and<00:06:01.010> like<00:06:01.970> I<00:06:02.150> said<00:06:02.420> it<00:06:02.900> seems<00:06:03.410> really

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:04.160 
and like I said it seems really

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.700 
and like I said it seems really
inscripted<00:06:04.940> on<00:06:05.090> to<00:06:05.270> his<00:06:05.420> hat<00:06:05.690> if<00:06:05.930> it<00:06:06.320> was<00:06:06.470> just

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:06.710 
inscripted on to his hat if it was just

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:08.440 
inscripted on to his hat if it was just
something<00:06:06.950> what<00:06:07.250> Scott<00:06:07.550> did<00:06:07.670> on<00:06:07.790> accident<00:06:08.300> and

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:08.450 
something what Scott did on accident and

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:11.470 
something what Scott did on accident and
we<00:06:09.440> wouldn't<00:06:09.710> see<00:06:09.830> it<00:06:10.160> that<00:06:10.340> bad<00:06:10.610> I<00:06:11.030> mean<00:06:11.330> we

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:11.480 
we wouldn't see it that bad I mean we

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:13.590 
we wouldn't see it that bad I mean we
brought<00:06:11.720> any<00:06:12.020> up<00:06:12.140> we<00:06:12.320> lighting<00:06:12.680> it<00:06:12.800> down<00:06:13.010> and

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:13.600 
brought any up we lighting it down and

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:17.830 
brought any up we lighting it down and
you<00:06:14.600> can<00:06:14.780> always<00:06:14.930> see<00:06:15.410> the<00:06:15.440> CD<00:06:16.310> so<00:06:17.000> I<00:06:17.450> really

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:17.840 
you can always see the CD so I really

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:19.660 
you can always see the CD so I really
think<00:06:18.050> it's<00:06:18.230> got<00:06:18.440> something<00:06:18.710> to<00:06:18.890> do<00:06:19.130> with<00:06:19.160> the

00:06:19.660 --> 00:06:19.670 
think it's got something to do with the

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:22.540 
think it's got something to do with the
game<00:06:20.020> and<00:06:21.020> I'm<00:06:21.380> really<00:06:21.650> interested<00:06:22.040> to<00:06:22.370> see
