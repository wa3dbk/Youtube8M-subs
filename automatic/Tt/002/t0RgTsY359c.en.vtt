00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.480 
going to show you how to use your

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.070 
going to show you how to use your
redstone<00:00:19.680> calculator<00:00:20.680> and<00:00:21.390> I'll<00:00:22.390> ladies<00:00:22.900> it

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:23.080 
redstone calculator and I'll ladies it

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:27.500 
redstone calculator and I'll ladies it
on<00:00:23.230> minecraft<00:00:24.390> well<00:00:25.390> it's<00:00:25.689> time<00:00:26.380> for<00:00:26.949> lag

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510 
on minecraft well it's time for lag

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.470 
on minecraft well it's time for lag
apparently<00:00:28.510> time<00:00:29.500> for<00:00:29.800> a<00:00:29.830> lot<00:00:30.070> of<00:00:30.189> lag<00:00:30.400> it<00:00:30.760> is

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:31.480 
apparently time for a lot of lag it is

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.290 
apparently time for a lot of lag it is
almost<00:00:32.169> nighttime<00:00:32.890> but<00:00:33.460> who<00:00:33.610> cares<00:00:33.879> i<00:00:34.059> have<00:00:34.269> a

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:34.300 
almost nighttime but who cares i have a

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.110 
almost nighttime but who cares i have a
huge<00:00:34.510> gap<00:00:34.900> i<00:00:35.280> can<00:00:36.280> see<00:00:36.580> on<00:00:36.730> this<00:00:36.879> screen

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:37.120 
huge gap i can see on this screen

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.560 
huge gap i can see on this screen
anyways<00:00:37.890> so<00:00:38.890> as<00:00:39.129> you<00:00:39.340> can<00:00:39.489> see<00:00:39.760> i<00:00:39.790> have<00:00:40.000> signed

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:40.570 
anyways so as you can see i have signed

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:44.430 
anyways so as you can see i have signed
if<00:00:41.290> you<00:00:42.159> have<00:00:42.339> made<00:00:42.729> everything<00:00:43.360> right<00:00:43.600> behind

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:44.440 
if you have made everything right behind

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.939 
if you have made everything right behind
the<00:00:44.860> thing<00:00:45.850> so<00:00:46.150> the<00:00:46.299> decoders<00:00:46.900> i<00:00:47.199> hope<00:00:47.710> you

00:00:47.939 --> 00:00:47.949 
the thing so the decoders i hope you

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:51.259 
the thing so the decoders i hope you
have<00:00:48.100> made<00:00:48.370> those<00:00:48.610> right<00:00:48.909> it<00:00:49.180> should<00:00:49.780> work<00:00:50.159> ok

00:00:51.259 --> 00:00:51.269 
have made those right it should work ok

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:54.899 
have made those right it should work ok
so<00:00:52.269> the<00:00:52.540> first<00:00:52.839> one<00:00:53.019> is<00:00:53.080> equal<00:00:53.920> to<00:00:54.040> one<00:00:54.339> which

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:54.909 
so the first one is equal to one which

00:00:54.909 --> 00:00:58.200 
so the first one is equal to one which
goes<00:00:54.940> all<00:00:55.420> the<00:00:55.479> way<00:00:55.720> to<00:00:55.780> the<00:00:56.080> one<00:00:56.970> then<00:00:57.970> the

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:58.210 
goes all the way to the one then the

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:02.670 
goes all the way to the one then the
second<00:00:58.540> base<00:00:58.690> to<00:00:59.460> 48<00:01:00.460> and<00:01:01.049> if<00:01:02.049> you<00:01:02.260> add<00:01:02.440> an

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:02.680 
second base to 48 and if you add an

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:10.649 
second base to 48 and if you add an
8-bit<00:01:03.100> one<00:01:03.309> that<00:01:03.489> will<00:01:03.640> be<00:01:03.790> 16<00:01:04.650> 32<00:01:06.600> 64<00:01:07.600> 128<00:01:09.659> so

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:10.659 
8-bit one that will be 16 32 64 128 so

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:14.280 
8-bit one that will be 16 32 64 128 so
we<00:01:10.810> are<00:01:10.900> going<00:01:11.140> to<00:01:11.380> go<00:01:11.740> from<00:01:12.070> zero<00:01:12.430> to<00:01:13.140> we<00:01:14.140> are

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:14.290 
we are going to go from zero to we are

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:16.620 
we are going to go from zero to we are
going<00:01:14.530> to<00:01:14.650> use<00:01:14.770> the<00:01:14.920> calculator<00:01:15.160> to<00:01:15.700> go<00:01:15.940> from<00:01:16.180> 0

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:16.630 
going to use the calculator to go from 0

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.250 
going to use the calculator to go from 0
to<00:01:16.840> 15<00:01:17.790> so<00:01:18.790> this<00:01:19.240> is<00:01:19.390> actually<00:01:19.540> I<00:01:19.840> could<00:01:20.230> use

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:20.260 
to 15 so this is actually I could use

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.650 
to 15 so this is actually I could use
this<00:01:20.680> for<00:01:20.950> a<00:01:21.160> binary<00:01:21.490> tutorial<00:01:22.330> I<00:01:22.420> could

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:22.660 
this for a binary tutorial I could

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:26.430 
this for a binary tutorial I could
really<00:01:23.260> easily<00:01:23.620> so<00:01:23.740> you<00:01:23.980> like<00:01:24.430> 0<00:01:25.030> 0<00:01:25.330> 0<00:01:25.360> 1<00:01:25.840> equals

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:26.440 
really easily so you like 0 0 0 1 equals

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:35.400 
really easily so you like 0 0 0 1 equals
1<00:01:27.360> and<00:01:28.710> then<00:01:29.710> we<00:01:30.040> go<00:01:30.810> 0<00:01:31.810> 0<00:01:32.230> plus<00:01:32.650> 2<00:01:33.310> plus<00:01:34.030> 0<00:01:34.410> is

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:35.410 
1 and then we go 0 0 plus 2 plus 0 is

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:39.240 
1 and then we go 0 0 plus 2 plus 0 is
equal<00:01:35.560> to<00:01:35.890> 2<00:01:36.190> then<00:01:36.850> we<00:01:37.060> add<00:01:37.380> one<00:01:38.380> to<00:01:38.650> that<00:01:38.680> and

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.250 
equal to 2 then we add one to that and

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:43.980 
equal to 2 then we add one to that and
we<00:01:40.240> have<00:01:40.420> three<00:01:41.760> uh<00:01:42.760> yeah<00:01:43.180> it<00:01:43.360> kind<00:01:43.600> of<00:01:43.690> sucks

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
we have three uh yeah it kind of sucks

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:49.920 
we have three uh yeah it kind of sucks
we<00:01:44.260> cannot<00:01:47.070> subtract<00:01:48.070> everything<00:01:48.930> because

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:49.930 
we cannot subtract everything because

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:53.399 
we cannot subtract everything because
I'm<00:01:50.110> going<00:01:50.440> to<00:01:50.650> try<00:01:51.159> to<00:01:51.190> learn<00:01:51.640> someday<00:01:52.320> how<00:01:53.320> to

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:53.409 
I'm going to try to learn someday how to

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:55.350 
I'm going to try to learn someday how to
subtract<00:01:54.159> because<00:01:54.580> that<00:01:54.820> would<00:01:55.000> be<00:01:55.120> really

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:55.360 
subtract because that would be really

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.800 
subtract because that would be really
cool<00:01:55.659> so<00:01:56.320> now<00:01:56.470> will<00:01:56.650> you<00:01:56.680> going<00:01:57.100> to<00:01:57.300> 44<00:01:58.300> plus<00:01:58.479> 1

00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:58.810 
cool so now will you going to 44 plus 1

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:04.920 
cool so now will you going to 44 plus 1
is<00:01:58.990> 5<00:02:00.180> now<00:02:01.180> we<00:02:01.240> go<00:02:01.420> to<00:02:01.450> six<00:02:02.340> and<00:02:03.600> that<00:02:04.600> also

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:04.930 
is 5 now we go to six and that also

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:08.759 
is 5 now we go to six and that also
works<00:02:05.380> and<00:02:05.830> then<00:02:06.520> 4<00:02:06.850> plus<00:02:07.060> 3<00:02:07.090> plus<00:02:07.270> 1<00:02:07.720> is<00:02:07.930> 7<00:02:08.259> so

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:08.769 
works and then 4 plus 3 plus 1 is 7 so

00:02:08.769 --> 00:02:12.259 
works and then 4 plus 3 plus 1 is 7 so
we<00:02:08.979> do<00:02:09.129> seven<00:02:09.899> then<00:02:10.899> we<00:02:11.110> go<00:02:11.290> to<00:02:11.319> 8<00:02:11.739> which<00:02:12.069> is

00:02:12.259 --> 00:02:12.269 
we do seven then we go to 8 which is

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:14.400 
we do seven then we go to 8 which is
probably<00:02:13.269> really

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.410 
probably really

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:19.970 
probably really
hello<00:02:14.760> yes<00:02:15.760> that<00:02:15.970> is<00:02:16.000> slope<00:02:16.620> 8<00:02:17.620> plus<00:02:17.980> 1<00:02:18.250> is<00:02:18.400> 9<00:02:18.910> oh

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:19.980 
hello yes that is slope 8 plus 1 is 9 oh

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:23.310 
hello yes that is slope 8 plus 1 is 9 oh
that<00:02:20.980> one<00:02:21.130> was<00:02:21.160> gotten<00:02:21.520> faster<00:02:21.990> then<00:02:22.990> we<00:02:23.140> go<00:02:23.290> to

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:23.320 
that one was gotten faster then we go to

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:30.840 
that one was gotten faster then we go to
the<00:02:23.680> next<00:02:23.830> one<00:02:24.570> yeah<00:02:25.570> 10<00:02:26.350> Oh<00:02:29.550> what<00:02:30.550> am<00:02:30.670> I<00:02:30.790> do

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:30.850 
the next one yeah 10 Oh what am I do

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:38.160 
the next one yeah 10 Oh what am I do
sorry<00:02:32.400> 11<00:02:33.930> so<00:02:34.930> that's<00:02:35.110> a<00:02:35.350> plus<00:02:35.560> T<00:02:35.800> plus<00:02:36.010> 1<00:02:37.170> then

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.170 
sorry 11 so that's a plus T plus 1 then

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:40.800 
sorry 11 so that's a plus T plus 1 then
we<00:02:38.470> go<00:02:38.650> to<00:02:38.680> that<00:02:39.130> one<00:02:39.430> if<00:02:40.270> you<00:02:40.480> know<00:02:40.600> how<00:02:40.780> to

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:40.810 
we go to that one if you know how to

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.720 
we go to that one if you know how to
count<00:02:41.050> minor<00:02:41.410> you<00:02:41.800> already<00:02:42.250> know<00:02:42.430> this<00:02:42.670> but

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:42.730 
count minor you already know this but

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:51.810 
count minor you already know this but
you<00:02:43.120> know<00:02:43.240> just<00:02:44.200> shown<00:02:44.790> 13<00:02:48.420> 14<00:02:49.860> 15<00:02:50.860> so<00:02:51.730> actually

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:51.820 
you know just shown 13 14 15 so actually

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:54.480 
you know just shown 13 14 15 so actually
it's<00:02:52.240> like<00:02:52.540> a<00:02:52.570> binary<00:02:52.960> display<00:02:53.770> but<00:02:54.370> it

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:54.490 
it's like a binary display but it

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:57.480 
it's like a binary display but it
actually<00:02:54.730> can<00:02:55.150> calculate<00:02:55.630> numbers<00:02:56.490> because

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:57.490 
actually can calculate numbers because

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:01.650 
actually can calculate numbers because
if<00:02:57.730> you<00:02:58.000> wanted<00:02:58.420> to<00:02:58.570> know<00:03:00.000> well<00:03:01.000> actually<00:03:01.210> you

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
if you wanted to know well actually you

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.570 
if you wanted to know well actually you
would<00:03:01.840> be<00:03:01.990> a<00:03:02.020> pretty<00:03:02.350> retard<00:03:02.980> if<00:03:03.130> you<00:03:03.280> didn't

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 
would be a pretty retard if you didn't

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.020 
would be a pretty retard if you didn't
know<00:03:03.700> this<00:03:03.970> 4<00:03:04.600> plus<00:03:04.810> 2<00:03:05.160> which<00:03:06.160> is<00:03:06.220> equal<00:03:06.430> to<00:03:06.640> 6

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030 
know this 4 plus 2 which is equal to 6

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:10.530 
know this 4 plus 2 which is equal to 6
and<00:03:07.390> then<00:03:07.840> we<00:03:07.990> do<00:03:08.140> eight<00:03:08.410> plus<00:03:08.770> 2<00:03:09.100> plus<00:03:09.490> 1<00:03:09.790> which

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
and then we do eight plus 2 plus 1 which

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:16.380 
and then we do eight plus 2 plus 1 which
is<00:03:10.690> actually<00:03:11.470> eight<00:03:12.810> plus<00:03:14.040> 3<00:03:15.180> which<00:03:16.180> is<00:03:16.240> equal

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:16.390 
is actually eight plus 3 which is equal

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:23.910 
is actually eight plus 3 which is equal
to<00:03:16.810> 11<00:03:19.230> if<00:03:20.230> I<00:03:20.560> would<00:03:20.860> use<00:03:21.430> this<00:03:21.760> dudette<00:03:22.920> digits

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:23.920 
to 11 if I would use this dudette digits

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.080 
to 11 if I would use this dudette digits
to<00:03:24.880> optimal<00:03:25.540> huge<00:03:25.810> use<00:03:26.410> i<00:03:26.830> would<00:03:27.580> use<00:03:27.820> eight

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
to optimal huge use i would use eight

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:33.330 
to optimal huge use i would use eight
bits<00:03:28.450> and<00:03:28.810> I<00:03:29.050> could<00:03:29.620> go<00:03:29.650> to<00:03:29.890> 99<00:03:31.200> what<00:03:32.200> car<00:03:32.980> that

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
bits and I could go to 99 what car that

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:39.360 
bits and I could go to 99 what car that
would<00:03:33.550> go<00:03:33.880> so<00:03:35.470> slow<00:03:37.140> that<00:03:38.140> was

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:39.370 
would go so slow that was

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:47.970 
would go so slow that was
swung<00:03:41.610> yup<00:03:43.230> that<00:03:44.230> will<00:03:44.409> go<00:03:44.590> slow<00:03:46.080> and<00:03:47.080> by<00:03:47.920> the

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
swung yup that will go slow and by the

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:52.559 
swung yup that will go slow and by the
way<00:03:48.159> i'm<00:03:48.340> nearing<00:03:48.909> my<00:03:49.299> 100th<00:03:50.230> video<00:03:50.650> I<00:03:51.569> don't

way i'm nearing my 100th video I don't

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:56.100 
way i'm nearing my 100th video I don't
know<00:03:52.659> if<00:03:52.900> I'm<00:03:53.459> I'm<00:03:54.459> going<00:03:54.879> to<00:03:55.090> notice<00:03:55.360> when<00:03:55.930> I'm
