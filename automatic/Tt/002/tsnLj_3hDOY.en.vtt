00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:08.700
 a training next to healthy 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.160
 common sense would have spoken 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.690
 this question is not completely clear now 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.679
 exactly but I want ye have the 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.299
 have guests I get me 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.550
 Press play is a cabin laugh 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.590
 seems to be over this answer because it is one 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.580
 fun is nothing else and the 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.560
 friendly people actually make it 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.869
 to make such a thing out of today 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.210
 then invite us all to do so 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:28.439
 keep calm so that the audience 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.300
 not before such a game 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:32.040
 each other or apartment and play 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.170
 I know each other upside down 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.760
 not if you're so responsible for three 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:41.219
 answers are actually given 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:44.520
 I do not know what all three encyclicals are 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.200
 take it off seriously and then he will do it 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.670
 actually the topic abroad perhaps 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.989
 impressive because we have to 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.239
 make sure that the topic 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:53.820
 there you see you did not mean yes 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:54.660
 the funny answer is not anymore if 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.760
 everyone else because I am now 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.739
 probably the same given out 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.010
 fun of because it was funny the answer 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:04.619
 of three years are completely stupid 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:06.510
 and I think well but wavered 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.400
 we have meetings that somehow I manage 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:11.189
 kevin will talk about it 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.140
 that I invited him to none 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:16.830
 to think about it when he does something 

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:18.479
 says something is wrong 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.650
 a player has to expect that 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:25.049
 I have worn them for 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:26.790
 hints drastically but if 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.650
 you just something black is then 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.170
 you should also there that something even so 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.460
 I understand and I am my healthy person 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.509
 reason enough for it to be so 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.150
 understand and I will tell him that 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.080
 and then I hope that you can rest him 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.970
 leaves 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.530
 and I'm just not going to advise anyone 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.180
 to talk more about this game 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.610
 Should any inner agreed 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:47.340
 will see the canceled this moment 

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:48.030
 to the topic schalke because hernstein make 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:49.410
 can do what he wants 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.510
 It then becomes a giant story 

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:52.890
 made it because he again dortmund 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:54.900
 and therefore there is no history 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.480
 give and I'm thinking of mine 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:58.740
 termine in this range then 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.280
 but they were not completed 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.290
 cancel 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.550
 That's just too dangerous you can do 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.280
 Do not read about it often enough 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:06.900
 subsequent story times four days 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.369
 Smooth iron again and I think so 

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.050
 is so important in this game that 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.330
 then it's about football and nothing else 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:13.860
 that everyone is responsible for that 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:14.940
 stands and I will play my game on it 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.290
 point out that you have that responsibility 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.660
 I will live up to her 

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:19.860
 But people do not become one 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.540
 but they also have to influence 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.810
 that's probably true 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:23.810
 light
