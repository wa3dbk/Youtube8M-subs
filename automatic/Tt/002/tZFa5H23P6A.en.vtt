00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:26.970
 here these ones I have those are not 

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.480
 washed but here I already have these others 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.720
 that are already well washed then 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:35.699

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.390
 brown sugar but it is already optional 

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:52.390
 you who are want 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:03.170

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:08.430
 without cutting it like they can put it there 

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:08.430
