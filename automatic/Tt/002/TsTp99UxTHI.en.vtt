00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
new camera whoo ok now I'm coming to the

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.259 
new camera whoo ok now I'm coming to the
part<00:00:07.589> where<00:00:07.649> I'm<00:00:07.890> connecting<00:00:08.550> the<00:00:08.730> pieces

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269 
part where I'm connecting the pieces

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.629 
part where I'm connecting the pieces
don't<00:00:10.200> worry<00:00:10.380> I'm<00:00:10.559> not<00:00:10.590> going<00:00:10.950> to<00:00:11.250> show<00:00:11.580> you

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
don't worry I'm not going to show you

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.089 
don't worry I'm not going to show you
everything<00:00:12.059> takes<00:00:13.049> a<00:00:13.230> while<00:00:13.440> and<00:00:13.710> it's<00:00:13.860> really

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
everything takes a while and it's really

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:16.730 
everything takes a while and it's really
boring<00:00:14.370> to<00:00:14.700> watch<00:00:15.020> make<00:00:16.020> sure<00:00:16.049> that<00:00:16.320> you

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
boring to watch make sure that you

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.160 
boring to watch make sure that you
connect<00:00:17.400> the<00:00:17.640> right<00:00:17.820> pieces<00:00:18.300> to<00:00:18.660> one<00:00:18.840> another

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
connect the right pieces to one another

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.529 
connect the right pieces to one another
believe<00:00:19.980> me<00:00:20.130> you're<00:00:20.340> going<00:00:20.580> to<00:00:20.699> regret<00:00:20.970> it<00:00:21.210> if

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
believe me you're going to regret it if

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:30.310 
believe me you're going to regret it if
you<00:00:21.570> work<00:00:22.020> hastily<00:00:23.420> yeah<00:00:25.070> we<00:00:26.070> have<00:00:26.220> all<00:00:26.310> pieces

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:30.320 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.100 

if<00:00:31.320> your<00:00:31.619> fabric<00:00:32.130> is<00:00:32.309> a<00:00:32.340> little<00:00:33.110> transparent

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
if your fabric is a little transparent

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:37.190 
if your fabric is a little transparent
you<00:00:34.260> can<00:00:34.320> hold<00:00:35.190> it<00:00:35.660> against<00:00:36.660> the<00:00:36.809> light<00:00:36.989> and

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
you can hold it against the light and

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:42.760 
you can hold it against the light and
then<00:00:37.380> you<00:00:37.410> can<00:00:37.620> see<00:00:37.800> if<00:00:37.980> you<00:00:39.410> are<00:00:40.410> connecting

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:42.770 
then you can see if you are connecting

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:46.819 
then you can see if you are connecting
them<00:00:43.770> in<00:00:43.950> the<00:00:44.100> right<00:00:44.309> place<00:00:45.440> if<00:00:46.440> not<00:00:46.680> you're

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
them in the right place if not you're

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:52.010 
them in the right place if not you're
just<00:00:47.129> have<00:00:47.340> to<00:00:47.460> get<00:00:47.610> arm<00:00:47.940> and<00:00:50.030> if<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.780> max

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
just have to get arm and if the max

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:57.920 
just have to get arm and if the max
you've<00:00:52.260> made<00:00:52.640> whoops<00:00:54.559> Luca<00:00:55.559> model<00:00:56.329> if<00:00:57.329> the

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
you've made whoops Luca model if the

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.260 
you've made whoops Luca model if the
marks<00:00:58.260> you<00:00:58.320> have<00:00:58.559> made<00:00:58.800> a<00:00:59.129> little<00:00:59.730> thicker

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
marks you have made a little thicker

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.820 
marks you have made a little thicker
like<00:01:00.719> mine<00:01:00.930> you<00:01:01.859> should<00:01:03.799> orientate<00:01:04.799> yourself

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
like mine you should orientate yourself

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
like mine you should orientate yourself
on<00:01:05.430> the<00:01:05.850> inside<00:01:06.560> always<00:01:07.560> because<00:01:08.189> otherwise

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
on the inside always because otherwise

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.710 
on the inside always because otherwise
your<00:01:09.360> pieces<00:01:10.549> might<00:01:11.549> turn<00:01:12.030> out<00:01:12.270> a<00:01:12.330> little

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:12.720 
your pieces might turn out a little

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:14.810 
your pieces might turn out a little
different<00:01:13.110> than<00:01:13.320> you<00:01:13.439> have<00:01:13.590> planned<00:01:13.860> and<00:01:14.520> we

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
different than you have planned and we

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:20.920 
different than you have planned and we
don't<00:01:14.970> want<00:01:15.090> that

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:20.930 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:28.609 

so<00:01:21.930> you<00:01:21.990> see<00:01:23.540> took<00:01:24.540> some<00:01:24.750> time<00:01:24.990> but<00:01:27.080> the<00:01:28.080> needle

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
so you see took some time but the needle

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:34.039 
so you see took some time but the needle
is<00:01:29.750> in<00:01:31.430> the<00:01:32.430> same<00:01:32.640> place<00:01:32.790> in<00:01:33.119> the<00:01:33.240> front<00:01:33.509> s<00:01:33.720> in

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
is in the same place in the front s in

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:40.190 
is in the same place in the front s in
the<00:01:34.140> back<00:01:34.670> and<00:01:35.670> that<00:01:35.729> is<00:01:36.270> essential<00:01:38.930> so<00:01:39.930> take

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
the back and that is essential so take

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.130 
the back and that is essential so take
yourself<00:01:40.590> time<00:01:40.860> it<00:01:41.250> will<00:01:41.520> take<00:01:41.759> a<00:01:42.270> lot<00:01:42.450> of<00:01:42.509> time

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:50.529 

so<00:01:46.140> it<00:01:46.439> is<00:01:46.590> really<00:01:46.890> really<00:01:47.810> important<00:01:49.520> that

00:01:50.529 --> 00:01:50.539 
so it is really really important that

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:55.969 
so it is really really important that
you<00:01:51.539> work<00:01:51.979> carefully<00:01:52.979> at<00:01:53.490> this<00:01:53.640> step<00:01:54.979> because

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
you work carefully at this step because

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.520 
you work carefully at this step because
the<00:01:56.580> different<00:01:56.940> layers<00:01:57.090> have<00:01:57.390> to<00:01:57.539> be<00:01:57.690> exactly

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
the different layers have to be exactly

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.880 
the different layers have to be exactly
the<00:01:59.009> same<00:01:59.039> size<00:01:59.610> and<00:02:00.080> there's<00:02:01.080> no<00:02:01.200> I'm<00:02:01.560> saying

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
the same size and there's no I'm saying

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.730 
the same size and there's no I'm saying
they're<00:02:02.250> about<00:02:02.580> the<00:02:02.819> same<00:02:03.030> size<00:02:03.299> on<00:02:03.720> about<00:02:04.530> the

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:04.740 
they're about the same size on about the

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:10.360 
they're about the same size on about the
same<00:02:04.979> shape<00:02:05.280> they<00:02:05.700> have<00:02:05.850> to<00:02:06.330> match<00:02:07.259> perfectly

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:10.370 

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:14.380 

like<00:02:11.370> here<00:02:11.760> it's<00:02:12.660> about<00:02:12.870> like<00:02:13.260> half<00:02:13.799> a

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
like here it's about like half a

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.949 
like here it's about like half a
millimeter<00:02:16.130> difference<00:02:17.600> but<00:02:18.600> this<00:02:18.720> can

00:02:18.949 --> 00:02:18.959 
millimeter difference but this can

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:21.320 
millimeter difference but this can
really<00:02:19.140> mess<00:02:19.530> up<00:02:19.739> because<00:02:19.920> it<00:02:20.430> in<00:02:20.610> the<00:02:20.790> end<00:02:20.940> so

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
really mess up because it in the end so

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:27.080 
really mess up because it in the end so
I<00:02:21.630> have<00:02:21.810> to<00:02:21.959> do<00:02:22.110> it<00:02:22.200> again<00:02:25.250> so<00:02:26.250> as<00:02:26.489> you<00:02:26.700> see<00:02:26.910> I'm

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
I have to do it again so as you see I'm

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:32.479 
I have to do it again so as you see I'm
done<00:02:27.420> off<00:02:28.100> connecting<00:02:29.100> those<00:02:29.310> two<00:02:29.370> and<00:02:30.530> I<00:02:31.530> have

00:02:32.479 --> 00:02:32.489 
done off connecting those two and I have

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:37.420 
done off connecting those two and I have
done<00:02:32.820> everything<00:02:33.090> all<00:02:33.540> right<00:02:33.690> and<00:02:34.910> they<00:02:35.910> are

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
done everything all right and they are

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:45.020 
done everything all right and they are
exactly<00:02:39.440> the<00:02:40.440> same<00:02:40.470> size<00:02:43.070> because<00:02:44.070> imagine

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
exactly the same size because imagine

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.890 
exactly the same size because imagine
that<00:02:45.680> like<00:02:46.970> half<00:02:47.970> a<00:02:48.090> centimeter<00:02:48.510> would<00:02:48.750> be

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
that like half a centimeter would be

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:51.410 
that like half a centimeter would be
sticking<00:02:49.590> out<00:02:49.739> this<00:02:50.400> would<00:02:50.670> mean<00:02:50.940> that<00:02:51.000> I<00:02:51.180> had

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
sticking out this would mean that I had

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.520 
sticking out this would mean that I had
done<00:02:51.450> something<00:02:51.989> wrong<00:02:52.380> and<00:02:54.290> that<00:02:55.290> I<00:02:55.440> would

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
done something wrong and that I would

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.190 
done something wrong and that I would
have<00:02:55.829> to<00:02:55.890> do<00:02:56.190> it<00:02:56.430> all<00:02:56.670> over<00:02:56.700> again<00:02:57.060> be<00:02:57.900> prepared

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
have to do it all over again be prepared

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:02.090 
have to do it all over again be prepared
for<00:02:58.530> that<00:02:58.739> to<00:02:59.100> happen<00:03:00.290> so<00:03:01.290> when<00:03:01.530> you<00:03:01.650> coming<00:03:01.980> to

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
for that to happen so when you coming to

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:08.319 
for that to happen so when you coming to
this<00:03:02.250> piece<00:03:03.620> be<00:03:04.620> very<00:03:04.950> careful<00:03:06.019> here<00:03:07.019> because

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:08.329 
this piece be very careful here because

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:14.720 
this piece be very careful here because
it<00:03:09.329> bends<00:03:09.660> a<00:03:09.870> lot<00:03:10.049> as<00:03:10.530> you<00:03:11.040> can<00:03:11.130> see<00:03:11.359> and<00:03:13.730> the

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
it bends a lot as you can see and the

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.550 
it bends a lot as you can see and the
piece<00:03:14.910> that<00:03:14.940> you<00:03:15.180> are<00:03:15.480> going<00:03:15.690> to<00:03:15.900> connect<00:03:16.230> with

piece that you are going to connect with
it<00:03:17.160> does<00:03:17.910> not<00:03:18.620> so<00:03:19.620> here<00:03:20.010> maybe<00:03:20.310> you<00:03:20.430> can<00:03:20.519> see

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:27.390 

what<00:03:24.100> I'm<00:03:25.800> you<00:03:26.800> have<00:03:26.830> to<00:03:26.950> bend<00:03:27.250> the

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:31.510 
materialism but the most important thing

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:37.740 
materialism but the most important thing
is<00:03:31.780> that<00:03:31.810> the<00:03:32.440> marks<00:03:32.770> match<00:03:33.010> on<00:03:33.280> both<00:03:33.310> such<00:03:36.750> so

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:37.750 
is that the marks match on both such so

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:43.350 
is that the marks match on both such so

taken me about two hours so I would

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:47.430
