00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:41.700
 flour and a glass of sugar 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:46.049
 I ask for permission I will take a little less 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:48.929
 about half a cup of sugar I don't like 

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:51.689
 too sweet too connecting a boat 

00:01:48.929 --> 00:01:54.299
 and one more little secret for that 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:57.649
 the dough was softer and softer, you can 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:02:00.060

 half a teaspoon of soda and some 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:11.459
 vinegar or if you put sour cream like me 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.430

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:18.120
 wsus ask the court to nato will be together 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:22.140
 can if you want to decorate charlotte 

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:24.840
 how i did for christmas is necessary 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:27.690
 take red apples so they are 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:30.680
 evenly painted on all sides for 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:33.690
 that all our petals have 

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:36.239
 painted box and stood out against 

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:38.609
 those if you bake a charlotte with decoration 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:41.549
 flower form is enough for decoration 

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:43.590
 two apples bigger well or two 

00:02:41.549 --> 00:02:46.109
 half the rest can either not 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:50.850
 use either put inside the dough 

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:51.739
 And so let's get to the blood all kv easier 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:58.590
 nowhere 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:03:06.170
 break eggs in a bowl add sugar 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:06.170
 and whip to foam 

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:13.489
 then add sour cream to the beaten eggs 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:27.049
 mix well now in this mass 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.049
 we have to sift the salt flour 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:40.849
 mix well our dough is ready 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:40.849
 such consistency it turns out 

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:49.220
 prepare the apples well washed apples 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:52.849
 we cut in half we clean the core 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:55.970
 and cut into slices 5 wide 

00:03:52.849 --> 00:03:59.410
 millimeters to here are caches in 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:02.629
 half a centimeter and so everyone prepared 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:04.370
 now take the form I will have 

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:09.280
 glass because it is no more 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:09.280
 suitable for the volume I lubricate it with oil and 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:16.959
 I'll sprinkle with semolina so that later 

00:04:13.549 --> 00:04:24.460
 easier to take out the finished cake 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:24.460
 the form is ready now I pour the dough into it 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:33.139
 starting to decorate 

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:35.360
 take an apple slice and paste into the dough 

00:04:33.139 --> 00:04:42.639
 vertically at an angle 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:42.639
 starting at the edge the angle is somewhere around 35 degrees 

00:04:49.230 --> 00:04:54.580
 next next slice 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:58.650
 also at an angle somewhere from 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:58.650
 half previous lobules 

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:10.290
 and also all subsequent when we come 

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:14.620
 to the beginning of the row 

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:19.560
 set the next slice forming a circle 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:19.560
 helix next row 

00:05:22.689 --> 00:05:28.479
 and how do we make a special 

00:05:26.439 --> 00:05:31.409
 drawing ending in the middle of here 

00:05:28.479 --> 00:05:35.229
 flower we have advised 

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:38.469
 start bye with a longer shred 

00:05:35.229 --> 00:05:39.669
 the biggest ones are in 

00:05:38.469 --> 00:05:42.789
 the middle of the cut 

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:44.019
 useful halves of an apple and getting closer to 

00:05:42.789 --> 00:05:48.489
 center use shorter 

00:05:44.019 --> 00:05:51.879
 I used the lobules in the center 

00:05:48.489 --> 00:05:54.729
 cut off the edge of the slice vertically 

00:05:51.879 --> 00:05:57.419
 the process of laying and baking they themselves 

00:05:54.729 --> 00:06:01.979
 a little petals will open now 

00:05:57.419 --> 00:06:01.979
 put our cake in the oven 

00:06:13.849 --> 00:06:23.300
 normal mode first down then 

00:06:17.159 --> 00:06:27.599
 closer to the top 180 degrees for 40 

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:28.789
 Our cake ready to congratulate you on 

00:06:27.599 --> 00:06:32.849
