00:00:09.839 --> 00:00:14.539
 so welcome to a first step episode skin and Maike Pope the 

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:15.489
 check 

00:00:15.489 --> 00:00:17.659
 for Hoffer 2 

00:00:17.659 --> 00:00:21.469
 What I want is just Michael to whom you are a very simple poop 

00:00:21.469 --> 00:00:25.109
 the chicxulub crater two generates percent of its texture z 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:26.210
 around 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:28.650
 with the anniversary Epping and my beans 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:30.710
 Percent of winemakers 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.150
 that everything works and things do not fit you need full 

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:38.850
 Program from Anna Bender two point games 4 percent newer version go unfortunately 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.890
 not otherwise six percent of export goods does not work 

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:44.000
 around 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.440
 she built he talks around from the theater part 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.400
 but all parts one percent 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.660
 a texture 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.700
 so the percent Nordhoff and that is 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:58.940
 and, of course, serve it and that's what the Bernese could do with it 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:00.090
 Basket 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.520
 around 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.000
 to keep using Moll New 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.580
 so Project Fangarme Blender to point 4 4 

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.350
 You see, I already have one 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.370
 2 inside 

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:14.640
 Unfortunately, the wm-title is a little bit different 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:15.880
 within 

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.090
 the 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:19.770
 then m 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.040
 the level 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:22.250
 that numbers 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:23.640
 since July 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.970
 around me by Markus Mittersill wonder that I do what has 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.760
 Actually no other reason Ismail just like 

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.610
 Although Obama is for many, Holger is outsider if he knows a bit 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:38.270
 and percent and not that the Irishmen explode for a moment 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.360
 or should stories 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.780
 then I'm looking forward to the model user now 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:45.790
 To become text 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:47.380
 it blows around 

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:49.690
 Cube exit that a bit 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:52.150
 because she can not see any answer 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:53.760
 nearby Adam Booth 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:55.210
 refers to the violence is called 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:57.400
 Well, then, being dictated was baptized 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:01.460
 the country governs this but now we have to cut per quarter knew 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.930
 specify at which the model should be opened afterwards 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:08.070
 the hot to Wilma 2 watts states it goes express control 

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:12.079
 to draw on Marx one chooses oneself 

00:02:12.079 --> 00:02:15.549
 these things we have chosen 

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:16.609
 Rungis 

00:02:16.609 --> 00:02:18.359
 because there are many changes 

00:02:18.359 --> 00:02:20.579
 Foreground percent 

00:02:20.579 --> 00:02:23.619
 when quasi young players highlight 

00:02:23.619 --> 00:02:26.619
 and around 

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:30.439
 that's our city Camden 

00:02:30.439 --> 00:02:31.989
 at the 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:35.090
 percent is opened this step I could not have arbitrary now 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.639
 I've chosen this before 

00:02:37.639 --> 00:02:40.019
 hard and around that 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:43.429
 From a texture the oldest city can fit 

00:02:43.429 --> 00:02:45.629
 Why would I want to see you soon? 

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:49.289
 how are you doing here in a window to me we failed once 

00:02:49.289 --> 00:02:52.179
 Look then that's not bad 

00:02:52.179 --> 00:02:55.639
 the whole percent UKE with Arrow off 

00:02:55.639 --> 00:02:57.429
 he is way Moers 

00:02:57.429 --> 00:02:59.619
 and give up 

00:02:59.619 --> 00:03:01.549
 Andrea 

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:05.290
 so got the pole inside has Dallas to the chip can also worked out 

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:08.679
 Under fit to create my text 

00:03:08.679 --> 00:03:12.969
 now he wants blessed Faruk e percent how did I do that and in the whole 

00:03:12.969 --> 00:03:16.329
 I just exported this picture what you see 

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:21.299
 and later, Kessler thought recorded and then the textures ported 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:23.319
 I say ten now 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:25.219
 this goes to here and on it 

00:03:25.219 --> 00:03:27.129
 Percent the level 

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:29.229
 there is a market there and only on 

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:31.499
 but scripts UBI 

00:03:31.499 --> 00:03:34.499
 you see like Fässler place 

00:03:35.089 --> 00:03:38.109
 "The size could be hers. Yannick does not like it 

00:03:38.109 --> 00:03:40.539
 so high - but murder is tourist 

00:03:40.539 --> 00:03:44.469
 come against Kadir Pokémon browser and then we may have had to say 

00:03:44.469 --> 00:03:46.329
 want 

00:03:46.329 --> 00:03:49.059
 I had saved that he was the first way the 

00:03:49.059 --> 00:03:52.059
 bertelsmann-daughters became exciting 

00:03:53.199 --> 00:03:54.669
 then 

00:03:54.669 --> 00:03:56.659
 Data like Photoshop or a miscellaneous 

00:03:56.659 --> 00:04:00.009
 Program with which the Oldenburger edited and then yours 

00:04:00.009 --> 00:04:02.859
 but theater part 

00:04:02.859 --> 00:04:06.129
 it looks like this you can now choose we wanted to do that 

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:09.099
 I just because it's a simple white kill it too 

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:13.439
 um will always play home games »Dice with six sides ie from 1 to 6 

00:04:14.149 --> 00:04:17.519
 and it stays white everywhere with black dots on it 2 lets it go 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:20.439
 you have here simply points drawn for percent the value 

00:04:20.439 --> 00:04:21.549
 12 want 

00:04:21.549 --> 00:04:25.440
 and has his hands off simply Piech deleted the whole then as a thiga 

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.440
 So saved child point Ikea 

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:31.289
 open the beer 

00:04:31.289 --> 00:04:32.099
 and 

00:04:32.099 --> 00:04:36.329
 Daun but Targ he finished downswing felony Jander 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:41.020
 percent part he finished 

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:45.169
 wait here in this window so that Blairs edit edit of the 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:45.889
 match 

00:04:45.889 --> 00:04:47.159
 Open 

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:49.930
 Zetsche would have finished King com TR 

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:51.080
 whether in plush 

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:52.969
 you can see her here 

00:04:52.969 --> 00:04:56.870
 Eurotek so that he sees further bets text or see 

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:58.860
 and now you can do it with the simple ones 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:02.150
 combat the control if this can scale around here 

00:05:03.699 --> 00:05:06.699
 Rosneft small money 

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:10.740
 a bit too right 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:12.900
 Hol texture has been great all over 

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:14.819
 Percent everyone could know the same 

00:05:14.819 --> 00:05:16.189
 check 

00:05:16.189 --> 00:05:20.639
 For that, I offered texture Exchange and Swing Value the solid time of SME 

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:23.999
 Billerbeck mode go and reset the fire on West as well 

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:26.999
 so now you have yours 

00:05:26.999 --> 00:05:29.550
 Textures, so to speak 

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:32.659
 um invited and provided so 

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:34.889
 I'm not too busy for that now 

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:36.479
 Percent there 

00:05:36.479 --> 00:05:37.719
 very easily 

00:05:37.719 --> 00:05:39.289
 because, first, will save 

00:05:39.289 --> 00:05:43.520
 In the middle of May, the car export would be diced way and also in July 

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:46.520
 Animals who start the way July starts at 1 course 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:51.720
 in order to prevent the founding one must create a classmate 

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:57.090
 then what about this texture of this this will be ex- 

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:00.550
 in eight cases like that it's easier to set 

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:02.080
 then explain 

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:05.169
 Percent the deadline and knotted Daria 

00:06:05.169 --> 00:06:07.529
 Sogeti also with animals 

00:06:07.529 --> 00:06:11.149
 and he already talks Hatton with Chile to the Belgian Dana 

00:06:11.149 --> 00:06:14.379
 then you know that normally it is just a window 

00:06:14.379 --> 00:06:16.189
 my classmate has to inflict 

00:06:16.189 --> 00:06:20.100
 but each institution admitted to open 

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:23.240
 because he knew that fish worked with her like mapping 

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:26.240
 For now just hope that the fan club for the sake of clarity 

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:31.169
 to go over here and here is actually the most important window percent 

00:06:31.169 --> 00:06:34.270
 so that the Knauer texture remains in the market two lives or we Seeed 

00:06:34.860 --> 00:06:37.449
 this must be called like Rotex tour afterwards 

00:06:37.449 --> 00:06:38.650
 the created 

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:41.650
 our test to be paid murder so 

00:06:42.809 --> 00:06:44.080
 for him too 

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:45.389
 Values ​​on the cube 

00:06:45.389 --> 00:06:46.759
 worked 

00:06:46.759 --> 00:06:49.759
 Gardener Tempo says so out of Duve 

00:06:51.330 --> 00:06:54.290
 and percent then gives the robes on the 

00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:56.020
 Textures properties 

00:06:56.020 --> 00:06:59.080
 here's the Complex for the World Cup in the right window 

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:03.909
 now here on luck battles invite us to our clever point ear 

00:07:05.669 --> 00:07:06.930
 and 10 

00:07:06.930 --> 00:07:10.199
 here will be right at the beginning 

00:07:10.199 --> 00:07:13.449
 and again please just delete them slowly 

00:07:14.319 --> 00:07:17.839
 and now the world would hedge then we would have that texture on the 

00:07:17.839 --> 00:07:19.210
 Property 

00:07:19.210 --> 00:07:22.330
 One percent showed the next section we install 

00:07:22.849 --> 00:07:24.659
 who fours it extremely 

00:07:24.659 --> 00:07:25.870
 and percent the rest
