00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
be switching over to Syria team just

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.049 
be switching over to Syria team just
since<00:00:30.300> these<00:00:30.449> guys<00:00:30.689> do<00:00:31.349> have<00:00:31.619> a<00:00:31.800> lot<00:00:31.980> of<00:00:32.059> skills

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
since these guys do have a lot of skills

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.959 
since these guys do have a lot of skills
so<00:00:33.899> I<00:00:33.960> ended<00:00:34.110> up<00:00:34.170> buying<00:00:34.380> a<00:00:34.530> centre-back<00:00:35.070> and

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
so I ended up buying a centre-back and

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:38.150 
so I ended up buying a centre-back and
then<00:00:36.180> I<00:00:36.210> got<00:00:36.450> a<00:00:36.480> centre-forward<00:00:36.870> with<00:00:37.710> four

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
then I got a centre-forward with four

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.040 
then I got a centre-forward with four
star<00:00:38.399> skills<00:00:38.700> and<00:00:39.000> then<00:00:39.180> I<00:00:39.210> also<00:00:39.510> got<00:00:39.750> a<00:00:39.780> left

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
star skills and then I also got a left

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.430 
star skills and then I also got a left
midfielder<00:00:40.649> revised<00:00:41.399> who<00:00:42.360> has<00:00:42.600> like<00:00:42.780> 90<00:00:43.230> pace

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
midfielder revised who has like 90 pace

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.380 
midfielder revised who has like 90 pace
and<00:00:43.739> I'm<00:00:43.890> believe<00:00:44.399> he<00:00:44.610> does<00:00:44.760> have<00:00:44.969> forced<00:00:45.300> air

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
and I'm believe he does have forced air

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:49.130 
and I'm believe he does have forced air
feels<00:00:45.600> also<00:00:46.160> so<00:00:47.160> basically<00:00:47.879> no<00:00:48.660> one<00:00:48.690> in<00:00:48.989> the

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
feels also so basically no one in the

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.290 
feels also so basically no one in the
serie<00:00:49.410> b<00:00:49.680> league<00:00:50.309> does<00:00:50.640> have<00:00:50.850> five<00:00:51.059> share

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
serie b league does have five share

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.290 
serie b league does have five share
skills<00:00:51.629> but<00:00:52.020> a<00:00:52.320> lot<00:00:53.219> of<00:00:53.250> them<00:00:53.520> do<00:00:53.670> have<00:00:53.879> four<00:00:54.120> so

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
skills but a lot of them do have four so

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.209 
skills but a lot of them do have four so
that's<00:00:54.420> why<00:00:54.600> I<00:00:54.629> picked<00:00:54.870> them<00:00:55.079> whether<00:00:55.980> they

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
that's why I picked them whether they

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.770 
that's why I picked them whether they
are<00:00:56.250> bronze<00:00:56.760> or<00:00:57.030> silver<00:00:57.590> so<00:00:59.030> I'm<00:01:00.030> gonna<00:01:00.600> be

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
are bronze or silver so I'm gonna be

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.630 
are bronze or silver so I'm gonna be

a<00:04:33.490> beast<00:04:37.680> 9.7<00:04:38.680> rating<00:04:39.070> right<00:04:39.370> next<00:04:39.699> to<00:04:39.820> risotto

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:40.150 
a beast 9.7 rating right next to risotto

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:43.850 
a beast 9.7 rating right next to risotto
those<00:04:40.720> two<00:04:40.960> great<00:04:41.650> pair<00:04:42.509> bronze<00:04:43.509> and<00:04:43.750> silver

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:43.860 
those two great pair bronze and silver

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:46.110 
those two great pair bronze and silver
so<00:04:44.860> this<00:04:45.009> team<00:04:45.220> doesn't<00:04:45.430> really<00:04:45.639> have<00:04:45.880> a<00:04:45.910> high

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:46.120 
so this team doesn't really have a high

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:50.719 
so this team doesn't really have a high
rating<00:04:46.419> but<00:04:46.720> they<00:04:47.139> do<00:04:47.199> do<00:04:47.740> a<00:04:48.070> lot<00:04:48.639> of<00:04:48.910> skills

00:04:50.719 --> 00:04:50.729 
rating but they do do a lot of skills

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:52.650 
rating but they do do a lot of skills
majority<00:04:51.729> of<00:04:51.759> my<00:04:51.940> team<00:04:52.120> has<00:04:52.300> four<00:04:52.449> starts

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:52.660 
majority of my team has four starts

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:57.450 
majority of my team has four starts

00:04:57.450 --> 00:04:57.460 
killer is except for the defense so I go

00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:00.210

and I check out my steam and yet again I

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:02.760 
and I check out my steam and yet again I
need<00:05:00.880> those<00:05:01.000> contracts<00:05:01.600> and<00:05:01.870> my<00:05:02.320> left<00:05:02.590> back

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:04.409 
need those contracts and my left back
gets<00:05:03.010> injured<00:05:03.310> but<00:05:03.970> i<00:05:04.000> don't<00:05:04.210> really<00:05:04.300> like

00:05:04.409 --> 00:05:04.419 
gets injured but i don't really like

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:06.000 
gets injured but i don't really like
buying<00:05:04.840> injury<00:05:05.289> cards<00:05:05.590> at<00:05:05.680> this<00:05:05.800> point

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:06.010 
buying injury cards at this point

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:07.409 
buying injury cards at this point
because<00:05:06.160> i<00:05:06.250> don't<00:05:06.460> many<00:05:06.669> coins<00:05:06.940> so<00:05:07.210> i<00:05:07.240> usually

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:07.419 
because i don't many coins so i usually

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:09.300 
because i don't many coins so i usually
just<00:05:07.630> swap<00:05:08.050> them<00:05:08.260> out<00:05:08.380> it<00:05:08.650> seems<00:05:08.979> to<00:05:09.100> be<00:05:09.130> the

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:09.310 
just swap them out it seems to be the

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:14.430 
just swap them out it seems to be the
way<00:05:09.430> to<00:05:09.490> go<00:05:10.050> and<00:05:11.880> just<00:05:12.880> apply<00:05:13.060> this<00:05:13.440> contract

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:14.440 
way to go and just apply this contract

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:16.469 
way to go and just apply this contract
and<00:05:14.740> also<00:05:14.979> my<00:05:15.220> formations<00:05:15.850> as<00:05:16.000> you<00:05:16.150> guys<00:05:16.300> can

00:05:16.469 --> 00:05:16.479 
and also my formations as you guys can

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:18.659 
and also my formations as you guys can
see<00:05:16.539> they<00:05:17.500> are<00:05:17.530> always<00:05:18.280> in<00:05:18.460> the<00:05:18.580> right

00:05:18.659 --> 00:05:18.669 
see they are always in the right

00:05:18.669 --> 00:05:20.909 
see they are always in the right
formation<00:05:19.030> because<00:05:19.300> not<00:05:20.229> many<00:05:20.410> of<00:05:20.560> these<00:05:20.680> guys

00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:20.919 
formation because not many of these guys

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:23.580 
formation because not many of these guys
without<00:05:21.220> popular<00:05:21.970> on<00:05:22.090> the<00:05:22.180> market<00:05:22.539> so<00:05:22.810> they're

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:23.590 
without popular on the market so they're

00:05:23.590 --> 00:05:24.930 
without popular on the market so they're
kind<00:05:23.710> of<00:05:23.800> rare<00:05:24.009> to<00:05:24.190> find<00:05:24.220> the<00:05:24.460> right<00:05:24.580> formation

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:24.940 
kind of rare to find the right formation

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:26.430 
kind of rare to find the right formation
and<00:05:25.330> i<00:05:25.389> don't<00:05:25.599> really<00:05:25.750> feel<00:05:26.020> like<00:05:26.050> spending

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:26.440 
and i don't really feel like spending

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:28.620 
and i don't really feel like spending
the<00:05:26.680> money<00:05:26.830> at<00:05:27.070> the<00:05:27.190> moment<00:05:27.220> to<00:05:28.090> get<00:05:28.210> them<00:05:28.449> in

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:28.630 
the money at the moment to get them in

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:30.600 
the money at the moment to get them in
the<00:05:28.750> 4411<00:05:29.470> as<00:05:29.889> i'm<00:05:30.160> just<00:05:30.340> going<00:05:30.460> to<00:05:30.490> be

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:30.610 
the 4411 as i'm just going to be

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:34.050 
the 4411 as i'm just going to be
continually<00:05:31.410> developing<00:05:32.410> this<00:05:32.590> team<00:05:33.060> getting

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:34.060 
continually developing this team getting

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:35.810 
continually developing this team getting
the<00:05:34.449> silver<00:05:34.900> so<00:05:35.139> there's<00:05:35.320> really<00:05:35.410> no<00:05:35.590> point

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:35.820 
the silver so there's really no point

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:39.270 
the silver so there's really no point
like<00:05:36.820> it<00:05:37.000> i<00:05:37.180> don't<00:05:38.050> i<00:05:38.380> don't<00:05:38.770> know<00:05:39.070> i<00:05:39.250> don't

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:39.280 
like it i don't i don't know i don't

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:41.100 
like it i don't i don't know i don't
need<00:05:39.550> them<00:05:39.760> at<00:05:39.880> nine<00:05:40.180> chemistry<00:05:40.720> every<00:05:40.900> player

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:41.110 
need them at nine chemistry every player

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:43.589 
need them at nine chemistry every player
so<00:05:41.770> if<00:05:41.919> they're<00:05:42.250> around<00:05:42.669> seven<00:05:43.210> that's<00:05:43.449> good

00:05:43.589 --> 00:05:43.599 
so if they're around seven that's good

00:05:43.599 --> 00:05:48.360 
so if they're around seven that's good
enough<00:05:43.840> for<00:05:43.900> me<00:05:46.139> so<00:05:47.139> it<00:05:47.470> go<00:05:47.650> into<00:05:47.770> this<00:05:48.070> last

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:48.370 
enough for me so it go into this last

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:51.120 
enough for me so it go into this last
