is<00:00:15.219> my<00:00:15.250> video<00:00:15.730> on<00:00:16.029> hyperpigmentation<00:00:16.930> and<00:00:17.800> how

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:18.070 
is my video on hyperpigmentation and how

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:20.820 
is my video on hyperpigmentation and how
to<00:00:18.130> treat<00:00:19.060> it<00:00:19.090> now<00:00:19.750> this<00:00:20.410> is<00:00:20.470> a<00:00:20.619> little

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:20.830 
to treat it now this is a little

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:22.109 
to treat it now this is a little
complicated<00:00:21.279> it's<00:00:21.789> gotta<00:00:21.939> get<00:00:22.029> a<00:00:22.060> little

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:22.119 
complicated it's gotta get a little

dive in so let's first talk about like
the<00:00:38.170> different<00:00:38.290> types<00:00:38.770> of<00:00:38.950> hyperpigmentation

00:00:39.569 --> 00:00:39.579 
the different types of hyperpigmentation

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:41.040 
the different types of hyperpigmentation
is<00:00:40.059> believe<00:00:40.329> it<00:00:40.420> or<00:00:40.510> not<00:00:40.600> they're<00:00:40.780> all<00:00:40.840> about

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:41.050 
is believe it or not they're all about

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.860 
is believe it or not they're all about
the<00:00:41.170> same<00:00:41.200> I<00:00:41.649> know<00:00:42.360> there<00:00:43.360> is<00:00:43.510> post

the same I know there is post

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:46.380 
the same I know there is post
inflammatory<00:00:44.260> hyperpigmentation<00:00:45.010> and<00:00:46.000> this

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:46.390 
inflammatory hyperpigmentation and this

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:47.880 
inflammatory hyperpigmentation and this
is<00:00:46.510> the<00:00:46.629> kind<00:00:46.840> of<00:00:46.899> like<00:00:47.079> dark<00:00:47.260> spot<00:00:47.590> that<00:00:47.800> you

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:47.890 
is the kind of like dark spot that you

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.000 
is the kind of like dark spot that you
get<00:00:48.100> like<00:00:48.340> after<00:00:49.090> a<00:00:49.120> zit<00:00:49.480> and<00:00:49.750> what<00:00:50.620> that<00:00:50.770> is<00:00:50.890> is

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.010

and the good news is is that while
they're<00:00:55.420> a<00:00:55.449> pain<00:00:55.629> in<00:00:55.750> the<00:00:55.780> butt<00:00:55.960> they're

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:56.170

actually<00:00:56.590> pretty<00:00:57.100> easy<00:00:57.250> to<00:00:57.609> treat<00:00:58.000> and<00:00:58.180> they

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:58.570 
actually pretty easy to treat and they

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:00.240 
actually pretty easy to treat and they
respond<00:00:58.989> well<00:00:59.170> and<00:00:59.199> typically<00:00:59.649> go<00:00:59.859> away<00:01:00.100> in

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:00.250 
respond well and typically go away in

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:02.970 
respond well and typically go away in
like<00:01:00.370> a<00:01:00.399> month<00:01:00.699> or<00:01:00.969> two<00:01:01.180> now<00:01:01.420> a<00:01:02.379> little<00:01:02.710> more

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:02.980 
like a month or two now a little more

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:05.340 
like a month or two now a little more
complicated<00:01:03.430> are<00:01:04.089> what's<00:01:04.629> called<00:01:04.839> lenta

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:05.350 
complicated are what's called lenta

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:08.070 
complicated are what's called lenta
genes<00:01:05.590> and<00:01:05.950> they<00:01:06.670> are<00:01:06.970> what<00:01:07.810> you<00:01:07.990> would

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:08.080 
genes and they are what you would

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:09.660 
genes and they are what you would
actually<00:01:08.229> call<00:01:08.500> age<00:01:08.709> spots<00:01:09.160> and<00:01:09.490> they're<00:01:09.580> not

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:09.670 
actually call age spots and they're not

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:11.699 
actually call age spots and they're not
actually<00:01:10.209> caused<00:01:10.420> by<00:01:10.660> aging<00:01:11.170> you<00:01:11.289> just<00:01:11.530> see

00:01:11.699 --> 00:01:11.709 
actually caused by aging you just see

00:01:11.709 --> 00:01:13.859 
actually caused by aging you just see
more<00:01:12.009> of<00:01:12.130> them<00:01:12.280> as<00:01:12.459> time<00:01:12.700> goes<00:01:12.940> on<00:01:13.090> but<00:01:13.390> those

00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:13.869 
more of them as time goes on but those

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:16.260 
more of them as time goes on but those
are<00:01:13.990> actually<00:01:14.500> like<00:01:14.649> your<00:01:14.830> UV<00:01:15.250> induced<00:01:15.789> spots

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:16.270 
are actually like your UV induced spots

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:19.230 
are actually like your UV induced spots
or<00:01:16.509> more<00:01:16.899> appropriately<00:01:17.110> sun<00:01:18.069> spots<00:01:18.340> and<00:01:18.700> then

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.240 
or more appropriately sun spots and then

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:20.969 
or more appropriately sun spots and then
you<00:01:19.420> have<00:01:19.660> finally<00:01:20.380> what<00:01:20.530> people<00:01:20.800> call

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:20.979 
you have finally what people call

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:23.730 
you have finally what people call
melasma<00:01:21.580> and<00:01:22.209> this<00:01:22.720> is<00:01:23.020> a<00:01:23.050> darkening<00:01:23.590> of<00:01:23.709> the

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:23.740 
melasma and this is a darkening of the

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.650 
melasma and this is a darkening of the
skin<00:01:23.860> that<00:01:24.130> is<00:01:24.310> typically<00:01:24.849> hormonal<00:01:25.360> based

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:25.660 
skin that is typically hormonal based

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:27.600 
skin that is typically hormonal based
you<00:01:25.899> see<00:01:26.110> this<00:01:26.289> a<00:01:26.319> lot<00:01:26.470> of<00:01:26.590> times<00:01:26.800> with<00:01:27.340> women

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:27.610 
you see this a lot of times with women

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:29.490 
you see this a lot of times with women
who<00:01:27.700> become<00:01:27.910> pregnant<00:01:28.090> or<00:01:28.539> birth<00:01:28.810> control<00:01:28.840> and

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:29.500 
who become pregnant or birth control and

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.980 
who become pregnant or birth control and
that<00:01:30.220> is<00:01:30.429> actually<00:01:30.640> the<00:01:30.819> most<00:01:30.970> difficult<00:01:31.270> one

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990 
that is actually the most difficult one

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:34.169 
that is actually the most difficult one
to<00:01:32.229> treat<00:01:32.590> so<00:01:32.920> that's<00:01:33.429> kind<00:01:33.610> of<00:01:33.640> the<00:01:33.759> scoop<00:01:34.000> on

00:01:34.169 --> 00:01:34.179 
to treat so that's kind of the scoop on

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:35.760 
to treat so that's kind of the scoop on
the<00:01:34.360> four<00:01:34.539> one<00:01:34.690> one<00:01:34.869> on<00:01:35.110> the<00:01:35.200> different<00:01:35.440> types

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:35.770 
the four one one on the different types

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:38.760 
the four one one on the different types
of<00:01:36.009> hyperpigmentation<00:01:36.700> now<00:01:37.479> let's<00:01:38.380> talk

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 
of hyperpigmentation now let's talk

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:42.089 
of hyperpigmentation now let's talk
about<00:01:39.330> how<00:01:40.330> we<00:01:40.390> can<00:01:40.539> actually<00:01:40.989> treat<00:01:41.440> them<00:01:41.739> now

00:01:42.089 --> 00:01:42.099 
about how we can actually treat them now

00:01:42.099 --> 00:01:44.699 
about how we can actually treat them now
what<00:01:42.849> causes<00:01:43.149> hyperpigmentation<00:01:43.690> is<00:01:44.140> melanin

00:01:44.699 --> 00:01:44.709 
what causes hyperpigmentation is melanin

00:01:44.709 --> 00:01:46.919 
what causes hyperpigmentation is melanin
melanin<00:01:44.739> is<00:01:45.250> what<00:01:45.429> gives<00:01:45.819> your<00:01:46.030> skin<00:01:46.420> its

00:01:46.919 --> 00:01:46.929 
melanin is what gives your skin its

00:01:46.929 --> 00:01:49.740 
melanin is what gives your skin its
color<00:01:47.130> which<00:01:48.130> today<00:01:48.550> is<00:01:48.729> nice<00:01:48.910> little<00:01:49.209> bronzer

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:49.750 
color which today is nice little bronzer

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:53.100 
color which today is nice little bronzer
but<00:01:50.229> of<00:01:50.349> course<00:01:50.530> that's<00:01:50.679> fake<00:01:51.509> now<00:01:52.509> let's<00:01:52.989> talk

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.110 
but of course that's fake now let's talk

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:54.630 
but of course that's fake now let's talk
about<00:01:53.170> what<00:01:53.679> we<00:01:53.770> want<00:01:53.950> to<00:01:54.009> do<00:01:54.190> that<00:01:54.429> in

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:54.640 
about what we want to do that in

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:56.339 
about what we want to do that in
treating<00:01:54.849> hyperpigmentation<00:01:55.270> is<00:01:55.899> kind<00:01:56.259> of

00:01:56.339 --> 00:01:56.349 
treating hyperpigmentation is kind of

00:01:56.349 --> 00:01:58.620 
treating hyperpigmentation is kind of
keep<00:01:56.679> that<00:01:56.950> melanin<00:01:57.429> from<00:01:57.640> going<00:01:58.000> to<00:01:58.270> those

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
keep that melanin from going to those

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:01.380 
keep that melanin from going to those
spots<00:01:59.080> that<00:01:59.649> give<00:01:59.890> that<00:01:59.920> it's<00:02:00.489> darkness<00:02:01.149> and

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.390 
spots that give that it's darkness and

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:03.119 
spots that give that it's darkness and
what<00:02:01.479> we<00:02:01.569> need<00:02:01.780> for<00:02:02.050> that<00:02:02.170> is<00:02:02.319> an<00:02:02.440> ingredient

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:03.129 
what we need for that is an ingredient

00:02:03.129 --> 00:02:05.729 
what we need for that is an ingredient
that's<00:02:03.459> going<00:02:04.179> to<00:02:04.390> inhibit<00:02:04.869> that<00:02:05.080> production

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:05.739 
that's going to inhibit that production

00:02:05.739 --> 00:02:07.589 
that's going to inhibit that production
of<00:02:05.860> melanin<00:02:06.160> and<00:02:06.520> that<00:02:06.849> is<00:02:07.000> something<00:02:07.209> called

00:02:07.589 --> 00:02:07.599 
of melanin and that is something called

00:02:07.599 --> 00:02:10.260 
of melanin and that is something called
a<00:02:07.780> terraza<00:02:08.410> naze<00:02:08.830> inhibitor<00:02:09.580> I<00:02:09.759> know<00:02:09.819> it's<00:02:10.209> a

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:10.270 
a terraza naze inhibitor I know it's a

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:12.059 
a terraza naze inhibitor I know it's a
very<00:02:10.509> fancy<00:02:10.899> word<00:02:11.200> I'm<00:02:11.379> gonna<00:02:11.470> try<00:02:11.709> and<00:02:11.860> spell

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:12.069 
very fancy word I'm gonna try and spell

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:14.220 
very fancy word I'm gonna try and spell
it<00:02:12.099> out<00:02:12.250> here<00:02:12.790> actually<00:02:13.660> are<00:02:13.900> you<00:02:13.990> reading

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.230 
it out here actually are you reading

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:15.480 
it out here actually are you reading
this<00:02:14.380> way<00:02:14.560> I<00:02:14.590> don't<00:02:14.830> know<00:02:15.040> because<00:02:15.310> I'm<00:02:15.460> like

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.490 
this way I don't know because I'm like

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:18.180 
this way I don't know because I'm like
you<00:02:15.700> have<00:02:15.730> myself<00:02:15.970> you<00:02:16.930> did<00:02:17.080> the<00:02:17.170> boy<00:02:17.320> but

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
you have myself you did the boy but

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.130 
you have myself you did the boy but
to<00:02:18.280> rosin<00:02:18.700> A's<00:02:18.790> inhibitor<00:02:19.240> that<00:02:19.300> is<00:02:19.540> an<00:02:19.630> enzyme

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:20.140 
to rosin A's inhibitor that is an enzyme

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:22.520 
to rosin A's inhibitor that is an enzyme
that<00:02:20.170> actually<00:02:20.710> helps<00:02:21.400> in<00:02:21.550> the<00:02:21.640> production<00:02:22.030> of

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
that actually helps in the production of

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.920 
that actually helps in the production of
melanin<00:02:23.530> so<00:02:23.800> by<00:02:23.920> inhibiting<00:02:24.460> that<00:02:24.930> you

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
melanin so by inhibiting that you

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.610 
melanin so by inhibiting that you
actually<00:02:26.650> keep<00:02:27.070> that<00:02:27.760> spot<00:02:28.240> from<00:02:28.630> gaining<00:02:29.410> all

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:29.620 
actually keep that spot from gaining all

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.310 
actually keep that spot from gaining all
of<00:02:29.890> that<00:02:30.070> melanin<00:02:30.760> and<00:02:30.970> that<00:02:31.720> is<00:02:31.930> going<00:02:32.140> to<00:02:32.230> be

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:32.320 
of that melanin and that is going to be

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:33.890 
of that melanin and that is going to be
in<00:02:32.380> an<00:02:32.530> ingredient<00:02:32.980> like<00:02:33.010> hydroquinone

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:33.900 
in an ingredient like hydroquinone

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.750 
in an ingredient like hydroquinone
hydroquinone<00:02:34.900> is<00:02:35.170> a<00:02:35.560> tourism<00:02:35.950> ACE<00:02:36.190> inhibitor

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:36.760 
hydroquinone is a tourism ACE inhibitor

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.730 
hydroquinone is a tourism ACE inhibitor
so<00:02:36.970> what<00:02:37.180> that's<00:02:37.330> going<00:02:37.450> to<00:02:37.690> do<00:02:37.960> is<00:02:38.260> go<00:02:38.500> in

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:38.740 
so what that's going to do is go in

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:41.550 
so what that's going to do is go in
there<00:02:39.040> and<00:02:39.190> help<00:02:39.760> kind<00:02:40.030> of<00:02:40.150> block<00:02:40.510> that<00:02:40.560> enzyme

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:41.560 
there and help kind of block that enzyme

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.280 
there and help kind of block that enzyme
from<00:02:41.920> producing<00:02:42.640> that<00:02:43.210> type<00:02:43.510> of<00:02:43.720> that<00:02:43.810> melanin

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
from producing that type of that melanin

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:46.560 
from producing that type of that melanin
and<00:02:44.440> darkening<00:02:45.010> that<00:02:45.070> spot<00:02:45.490> now<00:02:45.760> hydroquinone

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:46.570 
and darkening that spot now hydroquinone

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:48.420 
and darkening that spot now hydroquinone
has<00:02:46.900> kind<00:02:47.140> of<00:02:47.230> gotten<00:02:47.500> a<00:02:47.560> little<00:02:47.800> bit<00:02:48.220> of<00:02:48.250> a

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:48.430 
has kind of gotten a little bit of a

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.760 
has kind of gotten a little bit of a
shady<00:02:48.640> reputation<00:02:48.970> it's<00:02:49.930> actually<00:02:50.290> banned<00:02:50.590> in

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:50.770 
shady reputation it's actually banned in

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:52.010 
shady reputation it's actually banned in
other<00:02:50.860> countries<00:02:51.400> but<00:02:51.520> it's<00:02:51.670> the<00:02:51.790> only

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.020 
other countries but it's the only

00:02:52.020 --> 00:02:53.970 
other countries but it's the only

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:06.850 
something like hydroquinone you really

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:08.250 
something like hydroquinone you really
don't<00:03:07.060> want<00:03:07.240> to<00:03:07.300> do<00:03:07.390> it<00:03:07.480> all<00:03:07.630> over<00:03:07.960> you<00:03:08.050> really

the areas that you're trying to treat

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:14.580 
the areas that you're trying to treat
now<00:03:12.460> let's<00:03:12.790> say<00:03:13.120> that<00:03:13.390> you<00:03:13.480> prefer<00:03:13.690> not<00:03:14.230> to<00:03:14.470> put

now let's say that you prefer not to put

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.580 
now let's say that you prefer not to put
anything<00:03:15.070> that's<00:03:15.790> as<00:03:16.470> let's<00:03:17.470> say

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
anything that's as let's say

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:19.050 
anything that's as let's say
controversial<00:03:17.980> as<00:03:18.280> hydroquinone<00:03:18.670> or

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
controversial as hydroquinone or

controversial as hydroquinone or
chemical<00:03:20.050> base<00:03:20.260> there<00:03:20.500> are<00:03:20.710> natural

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
chemical base there are natural

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.520 
chemical base there are natural
alternatives<00:03:21.820> to<00:03:22.270> that<00:03:22.300> and<00:03:22.810> that<00:03:22.840> is<00:03:23.230> going

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
alternatives to that and that is going

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.740 
alternatives to that and that is going
to<00:03:23.620> be<00:03:23.709> something<00:03:24.130> like<00:03:24.340> kojic<00:03:25.150> acid<00:03:25.180> which

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:25.750 
to be something like kojic acid which

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:27.930 
to be something like kojic acid which
actually<00:03:26.260> comes<00:03:26.590> from<00:03:27.040> the<00:03:27.190> fungus<00:03:27.550> family

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:27.940 
actually comes from the fungus family

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:29.699 
actually comes from the fungus family
meaning<00:03:28.120> mushrooms<00:03:28.660> and<00:03:28.959> it<00:03:29.290> works<00:03:29.500> in<00:03:29.680> the

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709 
meaning mushrooms and it works in the

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:31.790 
meaning mushrooms and it works in the
same<00:03:29.950> way<00:03:30.010> by<00:03:30.370> kind<00:03:30.640> of<00:03:30.730> blocking<00:03:31.420> that

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:31.800 
same way by kind of blocking that

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:34.680 
same way by kind of blocking that
terraza<00:03:32.800> naze<00:03:33.040> enzyme<00:03:33.700> that's<00:03:34.239> going<00:03:34.420> to

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:34.690 
terraza naze enzyme that's going to

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:36.180 
terraza naze enzyme that's going to
contribute<00:03:34.989> to<00:03:35.260> all<00:03:35.410> of<00:03:35.560> that<00:03:35.680> melanin

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:36.190 
contribute to all of that melanin

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:38.670 
contribute to all of that melanin
production<00:03:36.480> so<00:03:37.480> what's<00:03:37.780> key<00:03:38.050> here<00:03:38.080> is<00:03:38.650> that

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:38.680 
production so what's key here is that

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.430 
production so what's key here is that
what<00:03:39.160> you<00:03:39.340> want<00:03:39.550> to<00:03:39.640> do<00:03:39.850> is<00:03:40.120> stop<00:03:40.630> that<00:03:40.930> melanin

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:41.440 
what you want to do is stop that melanin

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:43.560 
what you want to do is stop that melanin
production<00:03:41.530> and<00:03:42.160> then<00:03:42.280> shed<00:03:42.730> those<00:03:43.180> dead

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:43.570 
production and then shed those dead

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:45.720 
production and then shed those dead
cells<00:03:44.020> so<00:03:44.650> you<00:03:44.680> can<00:03:44.890> kind<00:03:45.100> of<00:03:45.160> expedite

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
cells so you can kind of expedite

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:46.920 
cells so you can kind of expedite
getting<00:03:45.760> rid<00:03:46.209> of<00:03:46.239> the<00:03:46.420> ones<00:03:46.600> that<00:03:46.810> were

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:46.930 
getting rid of the ones that were

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:51.290 
getting rid of the ones that were
already<00:03:46.989> there<00:03:47.670> continuing<00:03:48.670> along<00:03:48.880> in<00:03:49.510> our

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:51.300 
already there continuing along in our

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:53.759 
already there continuing along in our
inhibition<00:03:52.300> of<00:03:52.510> melanin<00:03:53.200> is<00:03:53.380> another

00:03:53.759 --> 00:03:53.769 
inhibition of melanin is another

00:03:53.769 --> 00:03:55.259 
inhibition of melanin is another
ingredient<00:03:54.010> called<00:03:54.340> niacinamide

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:55.269 
ingredient called niacinamide

00:03:55.269 --> 00:03:58.259 
ingredient called niacinamide
commonly<00:03:55.840> known<00:03:56.019> as<00:03:56.140> like<00:03:56.290> b5<00:03:56.860> it's<00:03:57.670> a<00:03:57.760> b5

00:03:58.259 --> 00:03:58.269 
commonly known as like b5 it's a b5

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:01.500 
commonly known as like b5 it's a b5
vitamin<00:03:58.300> um<00:03:58.930> this<00:03:59.680> is<00:03:59.920> similar<00:04:00.820> to

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:01.510 
vitamin um this is similar to

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:03.630 
vitamin um this is similar to
hydroquinone<00:04:02.140> kojic<00:04:02.590> acid<00:04:02.709> but<00:04:03.100> instead<00:04:03.519> of

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:03.640 
hydroquinone kojic acid but instead of

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:06.060 
hydroquinone kojic acid but instead of
actually<00:04:04.200> inhibiting<00:04:05.200> the<00:04:05.530> Torah's<00:04:05.830> Annies

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:06.070 
actually inhibiting the Torah's Annies

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:09.720 
actually inhibiting the Torah's Annies
enzyme<00:04:06.700> it<00:04:06.940> actually<00:04:07.510> inhibits<00:04:08.290> the<00:04:08.730> transfer

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:09.730 
enzyme it actually inhibits the transfer

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:11.370 
enzyme it actually inhibits the transfer
so<00:04:09.940> while<00:04:10.090> it<00:04:10.209> doesn't<00:04:10.510> block<00:04:10.660> the<00:04:10.720> production

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:11.380 
so while it doesn't block the production

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:13.680 
so while it doesn't block the production
it's<00:04:11.739> kind<00:04:12.190> of<00:04:12.310> reroutes<00:04:13.060> it<00:04:13.360> from<00:04:13.570> going

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:13.690 
it's kind of reroutes it from going

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:15.540 
it's kind of reroutes it from going
where<00:04:13.959> it's<00:04:14.140> supposed<00:04:14.260> to<00:04:14.590> go<00:04:14.739> so<00:04:14.980> to<00:04:15.040> speak<00:04:15.340> so

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:15.550 
where it's supposed to go so to speak so

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:16.860 
where it's supposed to go so to speak so
it<00:04:15.670> makes<00:04:15.820> it<00:04:15.970> take<00:04:16.090> like<00:04:16.209> a<00:04:16.299> little<00:04:16.390> detour

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:16.870 
it makes it take like a little detour

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:20.490 
it makes it take like a little detour
and<00:04:17.109> by<00:04:17.560> creating<00:04:18.070> that<00:04:18.450> detour<00:04:19.450> it<00:04:19.750> does<00:04:20.320> not

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:20.500 
and by creating that detour it does not

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:23.130 
and by creating that detour it does not
pop<00:04:20.950> that<00:04:21.340> melanin<00:04:21.970> in<00:04:22.180> back<00:04:22.510> into<00:04:22.810> your<00:04:22.900> dark

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:23.140 
pop that melanin in back into your dark

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:25.620 
pop that melanin in back into your dark
spots<00:04:23.500> so<00:04:23.890> now<00:04:24.490> we<00:04:24.550> have<00:04:24.850> a<00:04:24.880> couple<00:04:25.240> of<00:04:25.330> great

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:25.630 
spots so now we have a couple of great

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:27.930 
spots so now we have a couple of great
ingredients<00:04:26.289> to<00:04:26.380> actually<00:04:26.890> quell<00:04:27.430> that

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:27.940 
ingredients to actually quell that

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:30.659 
ingredients to actually quell that
melanin<00:04:28.660> production<00:04:28.750> you<00:04:29.650> need<00:04:29.919> to<00:04:30.190> kind<00:04:30.370> of

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:30.669 
melanin production you need to kind of

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:33.239 
melanin production you need to kind of
put<00:04:30.819> it<00:04:30.909> into<00:04:31.090> fifth<00:04:31.300> gear<00:04:31.479> on<00:04:32.099> shutting<00:04:33.099> those

00:04:33.239 --> 00:04:33.249 
put it into fifth gear on shutting those

00:04:33.249 --> 00:04:35.790 
put it into fifth gear on shutting those
dead<00:04:33.490> cells<00:04:33.729> so<00:04:34.419> you<00:04:34.479> can<00:04:34.810> remove<00:04:35.169> that<00:04:35.229> kind

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:35.800 
dead cells so you can remove that kind

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:37.980 
dead cells so you can remove that kind
of<00:04:35.889> superficial<00:04:36.400> darkness<00:04:37.180> on<00:04:37.389> your<00:04:37.599> skin<00:04:37.840> and

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:37.990 
of superficial darkness on your skin and

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:39.719 
of superficial darkness on your skin and
that's<00:04:38.110> gonna<00:04:38.349> be<00:04:38.530> done<00:04:38.740> with<00:04:38.770> ingredients

00:04:39.719 --> 00:04:39.729 
that's gonna be done with ingredients

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:42.709 
that's gonna be done with ingredients
like<00:04:39.819> retinoids<00:04:40.749> and<00:04:41.080> alpha<00:04:41.650> hydroxy<00:04:42.039> acids

00:04:42.709 --> 00:04:42.719 
like retinoids and alpha hydroxy acids

00:04:42.719 --> 00:04:45.719 
like retinoids and alpha hydroxy acids
what<00:04:43.719> these<00:04:43.960> do<00:04:44.319> and<00:04:44.949> if<00:04:45.129> you're<00:04:45.279> not<00:04:45.430> super

00:04:45.719 --> 00:04:45.729 
what these do and if you're not super

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:48.809 
what these do and if you're not super
familiar<00:04:46.029> check<00:04:46.719> that<00:04:46.930> video<00:04:47.110> out<00:04:47.460> are<00:04:48.460> going

00:04:48.809 --> 00:04:48.819 
familiar check that video out are going

00:04:48.819 --> 00:04:51.149 
familiar check that video out are going
to<00:04:48.909> increase<00:04:49.210> exfoliation<00:04:50.050> or<00:04:50.199> cell<00:04:50.590> turnover

00:04:51.149 --> 00:04:51.159 
to increase exfoliation or cell turnover

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:54.300 
to increase exfoliation or cell turnover
in<00:04:51.699> the<00:04:51.879> skin<00:04:52.210> so<00:04:52.870> that<00:04:52.900> way<00:04:53.259> those<00:04:53.740> cells<00:04:54.099> that

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:54.310 
in the skin so that way those cells that

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:55.529 
in the skin so that way those cells that
have<00:04:54.460> already<00:04:54.580> been<00:04:54.819> affected<00:04:54.939> by<00:04:55.360> that

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:01.900 
reveal those newer cells were you've

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:03.959 
reveal those newer cells were you've
been<00:05:02.139> kind<00:05:02.439> of<00:05:02.560> inhibiting<00:05:03.550> the<00:05:03.639> melanin

00:05:03.959 --> 00:05:03.969 
been kind of inhibiting the melanin

00:05:03.969 --> 00:05:05.999 
been kind of inhibiting the melanin
production<00:05:04.090> now<00:05:04.509> you<00:05:04.569> kind<00:05:04.840> of<00:05:04.930> see<00:05:05.139> here<00:05:05.529> you

00:05:05.999 --> 00:05:06.009 
production now you kind of see here you

00:05:06.009 --> 00:05:08.550 
production now you kind of see here you
need<00:05:06.129> both<00:05:06.460> and<00:05:07.050> because<00:05:08.050> what<00:05:08.199> you<00:05:08.319> want<00:05:08.439> to

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:08.560 
need both and because what you want to

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:11.969 
need both and because what you want to
do<00:05:08.710> is<00:05:08.889> shed<00:05:09.400> and<00:05:09.669> treat<00:05:10.300> and<00:05:10.509> shed<00:05:11.139> and<00:05:11.409> treat

do is shed and treat and shed and treat

00:05:11.979 --> 00:05:14.189 
do is shed and treat and shed and treat
and<00:05:12.159> the<00:05:12.669> key<00:05:13.000> word<00:05:13.300> here<00:05:13.719> and<00:05:13.870> I'm<00:05:13.930> gonna<00:05:14.110> be

and the key word here and I'm gonna be

00:05:14.199 --> 00:05:16.800 
and the key word here and I'm gonna be
super<00:05:14.680> honest<00:05:15.069> with<00:05:15.219> y'all<00:05:15.430> is<00:05:15.810> patience

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:16.810 
super honest with y'all is patience

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:19.260 
super honest with y'all is patience
because<00:05:17.099> those<00:05:18.099> dark<00:05:18.610> spots<00:05:18.879> have<00:05:19.029> taken<00:05:19.210> a

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:19.270 
because those dark spots have taken a

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:21.089 
because those dark spots have taken a
really<00:05:19.689> long<00:05:19.990> time<00:05:20.199> to<00:05:20.469> get<00:05:20.620> there<00:05:20.830> so<00:05:20.860> they

00:05:21.089 --> 00:05:21.099 
really long time to get there so they

00:05:21.099 --> 00:05:23.219 
really long time to get there so they
are<00:05:21.189> not<00:05:21.430> going<00:05:21.819> to<00:05:21.939> go<00:05:22.180> away<00:05:22.419> overnight

00:05:23.219 --> 00:05:23.229 
are not going to go away overnight

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:25.920 
are not going to go away overnight
this<00:05:23.589> often<00:05:24.250> will<00:05:24.400> take<00:05:24.610> a<00:05:24.819> few<00:05:25.060> months<00:05:25.479> about

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:25.930 
this often will take a few months about

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:28.559 
this often will take a few months about
12<00:05:26.560> for<00:05:27.279> the<00:05:27.339> average<00:05:27.520> inhibitor<00:05:28.210> to<00:05:28.300> really

00:05:28.559 --> 00:05:28.569
