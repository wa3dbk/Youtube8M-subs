of us I feel like it could have been

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:47.810 
of us I feel like it could have been
intentional<00:03:45.720> I<00:03:46.290> think<00:03:46.709> it<00:03:46.800> was<00:03:46.920> accidental<00:03:47.550> at

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:47.820 
intentional I think it was accidental at
