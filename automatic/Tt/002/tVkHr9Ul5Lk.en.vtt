00:00:00.399 --> 00:00:03.200
 hello fried readers this 

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.220
 motorola operating experience 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:06.730
 under the table 

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:09.710
 and today we will talk about what 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:12.419
 this happened in corps he 

00:00:12.419 --> 00:00:13.699
 during the period 

00:00:13.699 --> 00:00:14.999
 about 

00:00:14.999 --> 00:00:16.740
 three months 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.960
 so the first thing I want to call your 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.360
 attention to the camera button you see that 

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.169
 she is white 

00:00:23.169 --> 00:00:25.169
 and it was golden 

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:26.939
 the paint went off practically 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.550
 fully here you can see them 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.359
 more opening points 

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:33.120
 paints removed very easily 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:34.620
 small enough 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.350
 damage to cover 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:37.800
 Kaka but then almost 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.020
 instantly how much tile colin per pair 

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:42.220
 days 

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:44.350
 my button was golden then 

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:46.480
 turned white 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:49.160
 this is the first such big big 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.450
 a flaw in my opinion 

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:55.770
 The second drawback is soft coverage 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.570
 touch on 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:00.340
 covers 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:02.290
 battery compartment 

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:04.590
 we all remember well 

00:01:04.590 --> 00:01:07.810
 Too was such a phone motorola razr 2 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:09.800
 about which was also metal 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:10.420
 sledding 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.950
 the battery was also metal too 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:14.720
 soft touch coating 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.720
 and this soft touch cover tied 

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:22.380
 bells for six months or a year but she 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.660
 opus time gone 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:28.210
 but very afraid that 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.700
 with this product will be the same to 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.380
 sorry 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.640
 fears come true 

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.730
 give you show 

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:39.730
 You may have noticed that he is here. 

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.300
 little pop stick metal option 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:45.230
 coating 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:47.290
 in this part coming off maybe i'm so 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:49.450
 opened something else but 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.530
 percent 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:52.510
 process 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:54.370
 so here is the best seen process on 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:55.920
 really went 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.920
 and the cover is yahoo for the time being 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.190
 fastens 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:03.740
 like some kind of film 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.420
 that is, here's the back of the cover 

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.309
 you can see that but a few 

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:11.659
 Here is this coating as whether it is soldered 

00:02:11.659 --> 00:02:13.359
 to metal 

00:02:13.359 --> 00:02:15.879
 and here but 

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:19.039
 very very 

00:02:19.039 --> 00:02:22.119
 rises you can pick up something 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:26.459
 just a couple of minutes 

00:02:27.669 --> 00:02:29.119
 so that 

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:31.309
 how long does it go for this coverage 

00:02:31.309 --> 00:02:33.179
 envy of course 

00:02:33.179 --> 00:02:35.819
 payment show usage experiences 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:39.299
 but in my case you see 3 months 

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:41.839
 and there is damage 

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:44.069
 maybe I'll write off the forum 

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:46.549
 when she completely tears 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:48.579
 and when she completely peels off of course I 

00:02:48.579 --> 00:02:51.749
 I will make an engraving on this book 

00:02:51.749 --> 00:02:55.199
 motorola where is the quality of the coating 

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:56.809
 I think it will be 

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:59.179
 true because she 

00:02:59.179 --> 00:03:02.179
 step on the same rake 

00:03:03.309 --> 00:03:04.559
 twice 

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:06.499
 it seems to me 

00:03:06.499 --> 00:03:07.260
 not very cool
