00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.930
 channel and today we are with you as you understood 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:41.740
 already from the name we will be at home 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:44.210
 conditions prepare one of the options 

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:48.110
 keratin hair masks 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:49.790
 keratin mask and since you know i 

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.920
 I will not tell very much in principle 

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:54.650
 much kira shadows for what does he need 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:57.140
 Essentially, keratin is a protein that is included 

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:59.930
 hair composition and due to what generally 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:02.810
 hair elasticity is ensured and 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:05.269
 it is with this goal today we are with you 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:08.509
 chase this hair and make more 

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:11.479
 elastic and i will tell you about a very 

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:14.479
 simple and easy recipe that every 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:16.759
 of you or each of you can apply 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:19.280
 and make homes for this we need 

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:21.289
 as you have seen yes it is not mine 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:24.520
 Orange is my Abkhazian lemon 

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:28.009
 I didn't have any others at home but this is a lemon 

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:30.770
 half a lemon and it is lemon juice to us 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:32.539
 I will need now I will squeeze it 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:36.319
 more will be needed 

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:40.579
 aloe aloe juice and a few drops 

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:44.149
 rosemary essential oil and so 

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:45.889
 went and squeeze the juice lemon juice is ready 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:48.950
 now i take 

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:53.689
 falcon and accordingly i need 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:57.909
 add about 50 somewhere 70 grams 

00:01:53.689 --> 00:02:01.759
 aloe juice but i'm doing it somewhere 

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:05.659
 a little bit somewhere else so here 

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:08.890
 I get mixed up and now here 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:12.880
 add just a couple of drops of ether 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:12.880
 rosemary oil 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:16.990
 So 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:21.780
 one-two-three it turned out okay 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:25.740
 now I'm mixing it all up now 

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:28.580
 and go put on clean notice 

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:31.310
 slightly dried hair that is guys 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:33.600
 idiotic not first we head my 

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:36.920
 a little bit we did not dry up under 

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:40.200
 towel and then rub into the roots 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:42.870
 distributed over the entire length in principle 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.150
 that's enough for me 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.600
 all hair is completely sure if you 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.830
 few can in equal proportions 

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:53.490
 increase the dose 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.630
 here and then notice we have to stay in 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:57.720
 such condition 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:58.170
 maximum 15 minutes i'm about 10 minutes 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.510
 hold 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:03.110
 because otherwise simply we are not 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:07.620
 elasticity will achieve opera dry hair 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:09.150
 after 10-15 minutes, we 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:12.990
 my head 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:15.600
 I wash without shampoo, I do not use nickname 

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:18.990
 shampoo after this mask 

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:22.470
 washed my head ordinary flow 

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:24.390
 average lukewarm water to even 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:26.340
 she was a little bit at the end 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:28.290
 cool at all if you are cold 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:31.100
 water at the end to build and there will be more 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:31.100
 shine hair 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.370
 and 

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:10.700
 Do not be afraid 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:19.019
 it is better 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:21.120
 this 

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:23.870
 and here 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.870
 Yes 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:31.060
 regards to 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:35.530

 Russia
