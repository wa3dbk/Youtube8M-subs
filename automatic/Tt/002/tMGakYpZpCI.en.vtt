00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:08.440 
L&amp;L here the Bundesliga's are strongly

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:11.460 
L&amp;L here the Bundesliga's are strongly
on<00:00:09.070> a<00:00:09.220> very<00:00:09.400> competitive<00:00:09.820> league<00:00:10.270> i<00:00:10.480> pled<00:00:11.320> in

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:11.470 
on a very competitive league i pled in

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:13.440 
on a very competitive league i pled in
the<00:00:11.560> Spanish<00:00:11.980> league<00:00:12.160> and<00:00:12.730> I<00:00:12.850> think<00:00:12.910> it's<00:00:13.360> one

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:13.450 
the Spanish league and I think it's one

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:16.220 
the Spanish league and I think it's one
of<00:00:13.480> the<00:00:13.630> best<00:00:13.780> in<00:00:13.990> Europe<00:00:14.340> the<00:00:15.340> older<00:00:15.700> but<00:00:15.910> I

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
of the best in Europe the older but I

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.480 
of the best in Europe the older but I
think<00:00:17.230> Spanish<00:00:17.619> football<00:00:18.009> is<00:00:18.160> a<00:00:18.189> bit<00:00:18.369> more

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:18.490 
think Spanish football is a bit more

think Spanish football is a bit more
technical<00:00:18.759> and<00:00:19.210> creative<00:00:19.330> and<00:00:19.990> german

technical and creative and german

00:00:20.589 --> 00:00:21.900 
technical and creative and german
football<00:00:20.980> is<00:00:21.099> a<00:00:21.130> little<00:00:21.400> bit<00:00:21.490> more<00:00:21.669> about

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:21.910 
football is a little bit more about

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:25.890 
football is a little bit more about
strength<00:00:22.419> and<00:00:22.749> spirit<00:00:23.140> day<00:00:23.560> yeah<00:00:24.749> nobody<00:00:25.749> said

we can score and have more confidence

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.620 
we can score and have more confidence
but<00:01:26.380> when<00:01:26.530> we<00:01:26.649> play<00:01:26.860> at<00:01:26.979> home<00:01:27.390> when<00:01:28.390> knowing

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:28.630 
but when we play at home when knowing

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.899 
but when we play at home when knowing
i'ma<00:01:28.780> hit<00:01:28.960> away<00:01:29.079> I'll<00:01:29.710> go<00:01:29.799> to<00:01:29.860> this<00:01:29.979> one<00:01:30.189> when<00:01:30.820> I

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:30.909 
i'ma hit away I'll go to this one when I

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:32.219 
i'ma hit away I'll go to this one when I
give<00:01:31.060> all<00:01:31.180> my<00:01:31.210> bike<00:01:31.450> I<00:01:31.570> think<00:01:31.810> they're<00:01:31.990> a<00:01:32.020> very

00:01:32.219 --> 00:01:32.229 
give all my bike I think they're a very

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:34.440 
give all my bike I think they're a very
similar<00:01:32.740> side<00:01:32.979> to<00:01:33.189> what<00:01:33.340> we<00:01:33.520> are<00:01:33.700> they're

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:34.450 
similar side to what we are they're

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:36.630 
similar side to what we are they're
strong<00:01:34.719> on<00:01:34.840> the<00:01:34.930> break<00:01:35.200> we<00:01:35.950> know<00:01:36.130> that<00:01:36.399> because

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640 
strong on the break we know that because

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.639 
strong on the break we know that because
we've<00:01:36.969> seen<00:01:37.210> it<00:01:37.390> and<00:01:37.509> we've<00:01:37.810> conceded<00:01:38.290> girls

00:01:38.639 --> 00:01:38.649 
we've seen it and we've conceded girls

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:40.679 
we've seen it and we've conceded girls
on<00:01:38.890> the<00:01:38.979> break<00:01:39.189> against<00:01:39.640> them<00:01:39.790> and<00:01:40.509> I<00:01:40.630> think

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:40.689 
on the break against them and I think

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:43.380 
on the break against them and I think
they're<00:01:41.049> a<00:01:41.110> great<00:01:41.439> team<00:01:41.500> they're<00:01:42.130> also<00:01:43.030> in

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.390 
they're a great team they're also in

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:45.630 
they're a great team they're also in
good<00:01:43.600> form<00:01:43.899> right<00:01:44.110> now<00:01:44.350> and<00:01:44.530> as<00:01:44.950> I've<00:01:45.159> said<00:01:45.189> I

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.640 
good form right now and as I've said I

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.670 
good form right now and as I've said I
think<00:01:46.149> we<00:01:46.299> have<00:01:46.329> to<00:01:46.570> get<00:01:46.689> things<00:01:46.990> one<00:01:47.289> hundred

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:47.680 
think we have to get things one hundred

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.740 
think we have to get things one hundred
percent<00:01:47.710> right<00:01:48.070> to<00:01:48.490> qualify<00:01:48.969> him<00:01:49.420> barking

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:49.750 
percent right to qualify him barking
