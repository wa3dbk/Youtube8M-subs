 unlock the device or take it out of your pocket 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.730
 it completely automates the 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.230
 procedure for the new you that 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.650
 wants to check in when April was 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.689
 want to wait for the loading screen 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:30.090
 hit xiqing down here

 Do you want to check in? 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:37.620
 The problem is that often at this time 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.210
 You forgot already left the place then. 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:42.239
 You can not choose the location that 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.520
 you were playing in place and gives a 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.930
 In this process you end up 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:49.739
 Losing places you already were 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.760
 mayor and everything else then you downloading 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.460
 to check in 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.460
 He'll do it in his pocket alone. 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.530
 with the places you set the high 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.690
 xingu is not available in store 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.270
 Windows Phone Brazilian 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.070
 you can download it that is free you 

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:08.040
 have to change the region of your phone 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.680
 to the united states to do it you 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:15.180
 comes quickly in settings you 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:17.310
 come here in more language and change region 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.229
 countries of the region to united states 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.909
 The same is in mine and will ask for 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.909
 restart when you do it 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:26.159
 reboot goes to the store and low down 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:27.750
 I usually did this 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:30.479
 procedure in a video that I will leave 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.220
 the link in the description of this one from here 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.290
 that very slowly explaining to 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.990
 you the advantages and how to do it 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.180
 right right since you have a 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.790
 of the region and downloaded chekin 

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.560
 Let's open it always our screen 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.189
 explaining what he does 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:49.290
 Do you come here in configurations? 

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:51.149
 location enabled foursquare 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.290
 you log in to your foursquare 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.720
 using this screen 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:57.869
 in case it 's already done, just give it a ok 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:01.200
 and here is the great asset of this 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:03.750
 program I heard you Luis who you 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.299
 you are writing has a touch here 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:08.220
 are the places you register on it 

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:10.560
 to pee and automatically 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.290
 I have all three of these places in it 

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.860
 wins none so let's sign up more 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.350
 one now 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:19.830
 You'll see what it's like to go downstairs 

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:22.140
 Are you getting the GPS position? 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:24.270
 I can type here the place I want 

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:26.820
 look or the enter he will 

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.170
 see nearby places have these 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:29.760
 places nearby 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.200
 Let's add this here that a 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:35.280
 the bakery 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:37.050
 then repeat every day all the 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.820
 hours every week 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:40.200
 that's how often he goes 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:44.520
 mark you in place 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:47.280
 if I dial a minimum distance of 50 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:50.280
 meters 100 meters 200 500 

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:52.230
 so if you have that 100 yards it 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.060
 Are you going to make it? 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.400
 meters to check in already 500 meters 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:58.890
 distance is at your discretion that will 

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.750
 It's better for you the allowed time 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:03.870
 to do this you can also set 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:05.880
 here you can set whether it alerts you 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.800
 I'll let you not tell me to 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:10.200
 make silence or service 

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:12.000
 My confirmation for doing so leaves me 

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.860
 so all automatic confirmation 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.170
 if he can share it in the 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:19.019
 facebook on twitter and activated 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.790
 hence the question is it is scheduled 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:22.620
 to do this every hour you want to say 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:25.140
 If I stay five hours in that bakery and 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:27.900
 will make five checks will not make 

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:30.989
 pee at one time only if I switch from 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:34.049
 place and go back to the bakery there yes he 

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:35.970
 will mark me in the bakery is understood 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:38.160
 I stay five hours in this place 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:41.430
 it marks once only if I stay one 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:43.790
 Time here is an hour here and back to 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:46.260
 here then yes mark this spot again 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:50.280
 it's not a dumb app like you 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:52.620
 realize save soon 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.989
 the bakery downstairs if I have 500 

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:58.310
 meters will check in at this time. 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:04:00.780
 bakery in touch and delete there 

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:03.510
 ready simple as well 

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:06.330
 That's the big question that's going to do that. 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:09.209
 spend a lot of battery the answer is no no 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:12.030
 you spend a lot of battery power you do not have 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:14.760
 because windows phone it's already gone 

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:17.549
 written here it already captures every 15 

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:19.440
 minutes to your location exactly by 

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:22.020
 cause of the locator that comes with the 

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:24.900
 windows phone and every half hour the 

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:27.720
 application updates his life style 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:30.360
 that is down here and with that he 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:33.180
 mark your position wherever you are 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:34.860
 so if you expect him to check 

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:37.440
 exactly when you arrive in the place 

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:40.380
 will not roll and will check in 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:42.360
 half an hour from one in an hour 

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:46.530
 he uses information he saw his cell phone already 

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:48.480
 has gps and more lightweight update than 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:50.610
 windows phone allows in it with your 

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:54.360
 combination or video advocate 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:56.670
 updated this combination allows 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:58.860
 you have a good big battery that the 

00:04:56.670 --> 00:05:00.630
 application anyway then run 

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:03.720
 I recommend you a lot 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:05.040
 the high xingu as I had said in the 

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:06.300
 start of video 

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:08.430
 I'll leave the link in the video description 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:10.410

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:12.660
