crucial time and where you're changing
things<00:00:27.060> at<00:00:27.330> most<00:00:27.539> and<00:00:27.689> we're<00:00:27.779> all<00:00:27.900> the<00:00:28.050> thrust

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
things at most and we're all the thrust

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.599 
things at most and we're all the thrust
is<00:00:28.500> on<00:00:28.650> there<00:00:28.859> and<00:00:28.920> what<00:00:29.070> do<00:00:29.189> you<00:00:29.250> think<00:00:29.490> about

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
is on there and what do you think about

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:31.759

when<00:00:29.910> you're<00:00:30.029> getting<00:00:30.119> ready<00:00:30.449> to<00:00:30.510> launch<00:00:30.769> and

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
when you're getting ready to launch and

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.220 
when you're getting ready to launch and
I<00:00:32.099> think<00:00:32.309> the<00:00:32.759> question<00:00:33.270> goes<00:00:33.480> back<00:00:33.510> how<00:00:34.170> do

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
I think the question goes back how do

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.569 
I think the question goes back how do
you<00:00:34.320> think<00:00:34.500> you'd<00:00:34.739> feel<00:00:34.980> if<00:00:35.130> you<00:00:35.250> knew<00:00:35.430> you're

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
you think you'd feel if you knew you're

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.580 
you think you'd feel if you knew you're
on<00:00:35.700> top<00:00:35.910> of<00:00:35.940> 20<00:00:36.390> million<00:00:36.570> two<00:00:36.899> million<00:00:37.110> parts

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
on top of 20 million two million parts

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:38.840 
on top of 20 million two million parts
built<00:00:37.800> by<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.100> lowest<00:00:38.370> bidder<00:00:38.460> on<00:00:38.820> a

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
built by the lowest bidder on a

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:49.360 
built by the lowest bidder on a
government<00:00:45.800> cuts<00:00:46.800> the<00:00:46.980> flippant<00:00:47.399> answer<00:00:47.550> I

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:49.370 
government cuts the flippant answer I

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.729 
government cuts the flippant answer I
think<00:00:50.370> you<00:00:50.789> you<00:00:51.390> develop<00:00:52.140> courage<00:00:52.379> from<00:00:52.590> a

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
think you you develop courage from a

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:55.310 
think you you develop courage from a
couple<00:00:53.039> areas<00:00:53.190> one<00:00:53.730> you're<00:00:53.910> developed<00:00:54.360> this

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
couple areas one you're developed this

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.439 
couple areas one you're developed this
by<00:00:55.500> what<00:00:55.710> your<00:00:55.860> purpose<00:00:56.280> is<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:57.120> mission

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
by what your purpose is the mission

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.020 
by what your purpose is the mission
you're<00:00:57.629> dedicated<00:00:58.170> to<00:00:58.289> a<00:00:58.320> mission<00:00:58.710> and<00:00:59.370> by<00:00:59.969> the

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
you're dedicated to a mission and by the

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:03.410 
you're dedicated to a mission and by the
preparation<00:01:01.879> and<00:01:02.879> that<00:01:02.940> gives<00:01:03.300> you

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
preparation and that gives you

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.060 
preparation and that gives you
confidence<00:01:03.660> you<00:01:03.960> can<00:01:04.140> really<00:01:04.470> do<00:01:04.619> this<00:01:04.830> thing

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:05.070 
confidence you can really do this thing

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.460 
confidence you can really do this thing
that<00:01:05.220> you've<00:01:05.400> really<00:01:05.580> tried<00:01:05.880> to<00:01:06.090> to<00:01:07.020> see<00:01:07.229> all

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
that you've really tried to to see all

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:08.960 
that you've really tried to to see all
the<00:01:07.619> aspects<00:01:08.100> of<00:01:08.250> it<00:01:08.310> and<00:01:08.490> all<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:08.760> things

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
the aspects of it and all the things

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.429 
the aspects of it and all the things
that<00:01:09.060> can<00:01:09.210> go<00:01:09.360> wrong<00:01:09.390> you've<00:01:09.810> tried<00:01:10.049> to<00:01:10.229> take

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:10.439 
that can go wrong you've tried to take

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:11.870 
that can go wrong you've tried to take
care<00:01:10.650> of<00:01:10.770> those<00:01:10.890> things<00:01:11.130> before<00:01:11.549> you<00:01:11.670> launch

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
care of those things before you launch

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.030 
care of those things before you launch
so<00:01:12.720> I<00:01:12.750> think<00:01:12.869> it<00:01:13.049> comes<00:01:13.200> from<00:01:13.380> two<00:01:13.560> things<00:01:13.770> one

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
so I think it comes from two things one

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.490 
so I think it comes from two things one
dedication<00:01:14.760> to<00:01:14.970> the<00:01:15.689> country<00:01:15.869> and<00:01:16.229> what<00:01:16.380> you

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
dedication to the country and what you

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.530 
dedication to the country and what you
think<00:01:16.860> is<00:01:17.040> important<00:01:17.549> for<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:17.759> country<00:01:17.909> back

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
think is important for the country back

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.210 
think is important for the country back
in<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:18.750> early<00:01:19.020> days<00:01:19.049> it<00:01:19.409> was<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.710> competition

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
in the early days it was the competition

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.330 
in the early days it was the competition
with<00:01:20.640> the<00:01:20.790> Soviets<00:01:21.270> who<00:01:21.479> we<00:01:21.630> weren't<00:01:21.900> sure

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
with the Soviets who we weren't sure

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.490 
with the Soviets who we weren't sure
then<00:01:23.340> might<00:01:23.970> be<00:01:24.150> taking<00:01:24.780> over<00:01:24.990> the<00:01:25.140> world

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
then might be taking over the world

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.179 
then might be taking over the world
and<00:01:25.770> then<00:01:26.700> it's<00:01:26.850> preparation<00:01:27.540> and

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:28.189 
and then it's preparation and

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:30.560 
and then it's preparation and
preparation<00:01:29.189> and<00:01:29.369> preparation<00:01:30.180> that<00:01:30.329> gives

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
preparation and preparation that gives

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.620 
preparation and preparation that gives
you<00:01:30.689> confidence<00:01:30.869> to<00:01:31.259> go<00:01:31.729> well<00:01:32.729> sometimes<00:01:33.299> when

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
you confidence to go well sometimes when

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:36.530 
you confidence to go well sometimes when
you're<00:01:34.040> confronted<00:01:35.040> with<00:01:35.070> a<00:01:35.340> problem<00:01:35.970> and

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
you're confronted with a problem and

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.410 
you're confronted with a problem and
there<00:01:36.810> was<00:01:36.990> no<00:01:37.229> alternative<00:01:38.060> either<00:01:39.060> had<00:01:39.299> to

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
there was no alternative either had to

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.050 
there was no alternative either had to
have<00:01:39.570> the<00:01:39.720> courage<00:01:40.140> to<00:01:40.320> continue<00:01:40.610> or<00:01:41.610> you<00:01:41.909> were

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
have the courage to continue or you were

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.920 
have the courage to continue or you were
lost<00:01:42.270> and<00:01:43.220> consequently<00:01:44.220> on<00:01:44.579> Apollo<00:01:45.119> 13<00:01:45.210> when

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:45.930 
lost and consequently on Apollo 13 when

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.710 
lost and consequently on Apollo 13 when
the<00:01:46.110> explosion<00:01:46.740> first<00:01:46.920> occurred<00:01:47.570> and<00:01:48.570> we

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
the explosion first occurred and we

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.160 
the explosion first occurred and we
didn't<00:01:48.960> know<00:01:49.020> what<00:01:49.200> happened<00:01:49.380> and<00:01:50.570> we<00:01:51.570> first

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
didn't know what happened and we first

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.960 
didn't know what happened and we first
didn't<00:01:52.530> think<00:01:52.770> we<00:01:52.950> were<00:01:53.009> in<00:01:53.100> that<00:01:53.280> danger

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
didn't think we were in that danger

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.350 
didn't think we were in that danger
until<00:01:54.720> I<00:01:55.020> saw<00:01:55.439> the<00:01:55.500> oxygen<00:01:56.189> escaping<00:01:56.880> from<00:01:57.090> the

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.360 
until I saw the oxygen escaping from the

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.800 
until I saw the oxygen escaping from the
spacecraft<00:01:57.899> and<00:01:58.200> then<00:01:58.320> I<00:01:58.380> realized<00:01:58.890> that<00:01:59.810> we

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
spacecraft and then I realized that we

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.389 
spacecraft and then I realized that we
were<00:02:00.960> in<00:02:01.079> serious<00:02:01.469> danger<00:02:01.680> and<00:02:02.130> we<00:02:02.219> looked

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:02.399 
were in serious danger and we looked

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:04.819 
were in serious danger and we looked
around<00:02:02.610> to<00:02:02.850> see<00:02:02.880> what<00:02:03.210> we<00:02:03.360> had<00:02:03.600> to<00:02:03.840> use<00:02:04.170> and<00:02:04.619> the

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:04.829 
around to see what we had to use and the

00:02:04.829 --> 00:02:07.910 
around to see what we had to use and the
lunar<00:02:05.070> module<00:02:05.310> very<00:02:06.180> fortunately<00:02:06.780> was<00:02:06.990> a<00:02:07.020> part

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:07.920 
lunar module very fortunately was a part

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.899 
lunar module very fortunately was a part
of<00:02:08.009> our<00:02:08.160> system<00:02:08.459> and<00:02:09.410> then<00:02:10.410> we<00:02:10.679> were<00:02:10.830> very

00:02:11.899 --> 00:02:11.909 
of our system and then we were very

00:02:11.909 --> 00:02:15.170 
of our system and then we were very
closely<00:02:12.750> with<00:02:13.260> a<00:02:13.290> dedicated<00:02:14.250> group<00:02:14.610> of<00:02:14.849> people

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
closely with a dedicated group of people

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.630 
closely with a dedicated group of people

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
at the Mission Control Center which

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.930 
at the Mission Control Center which
indicated<00:02:18.269> to<00:02:18.450> me<00:02:18.629> that<00:02:19.129> the<00:02:20.129> good<00:02:20.580> leadership

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
indicated to me that the good leadership

working<00:02:29.280> with<00:02:29.580> the<00:02:29.760> crew<00:02:30.680> indicated<00:02:31.680> that

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
working with the crew indicated that

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.100 
working with the crew indicated that
Apollo<00:02:32.459> 13<00:02:32.940> was<00:02:33.180> not<00:02:33.360> just<00:02:33.720> a<00:02:33.959> another

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
Apollo 13 was not just a another

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.130 
Apollo 13 was not just a another
spaceflight<00:02:37.110> of<00:02:38.150> dangerous<00:02:39.150> situations<00:02:39.360> but

spaceflight of dangerous situations but

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.350 
spaceflight of dangerous situations but
really<00:02:40.410> a<00:02:40.440> classic<00:02:41.159> case<00:02:41.400> of<00:02:41.730> crisis

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
really a classic case of crisis

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
land eagle on the moon he found out I

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:50.630 
land eagle on the moon he found out I
believe<00:02:49.530> that<00:02:49.799> they<00:02:50.069> were<00:02:50.129> heading<00:02:50.489> you

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
believe that they were heading you

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.170 
believe that they were heading you
toward<00:02:52.160> crater<00:02:53.160> that<00:02:53.430> you<00:02:53.609> didn't<00:02:53.910> want<00:02:54.120> to

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
toward crater that you didn't want to

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.979 
toward crater that you didn't want to
land<00:02:54.599> in<00:02:54.870> and<00:02:55.739> you<00:02:55.890> had<00:02:56.099> to<00:02:56.459> fly<00:02:57.209> your<00:02:57.599> ship

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
land in and you had to fly your ship

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:00.199 
land in and you had to fly your ship
across<00:02:58.590> the<00:02:58.829> surface<00:02:59.220> of<00:02:59.400> the<00:02:59.459> Moon<00:02:59.670> until<00:03:00.060> you

00:03:00.199 --> 00:03:00.209 
across the surface of the Moon until you

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:03.110 
across the surface of the Moon until you
could<00:03:00.420> find<00:03:01.379> a<00:03:01.500> spot<00:03:01.620> to<00:03:02.010> sit<00:03:02.190> it<00:03:02.370> down<00:03:02.549> I<00:03:02.579> think

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
could find a spot to sit it down I think

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.259 
could find a spot to sit it down I think
you<00:03:03.359> had<00:03:03.540> 16<00:03:04.140> seconds<00:03:04.650> of<00:03:04.739> fuel<00:03:04.950> left<00:03:05.340> can<00:03:06.180> you

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:06.269 
you had 16 seconds of fuel left can you

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:07.869 
you had 16 seconds of fuel left can you
tell<00:03:06.480> us<00:03:06.510> what<00:03:06.780> that<00:03:06.810> was<00:03:06.989> like

00:03:07.869 --> 00:03:07.879 
tell us what that was like

00:03:07.879 --> 00:03:16.839 
tell us what that was like
no<00:03:08.879> pilot<00:03:09.239> likes<00:03:09.690> to<00:03:09.959> land<00:03:10.230> in<00:03:10.560> a<00:03:10.829> bad<00:03:11.370> place

00:03:16.839 --> 00:03:16.849 

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:21.170 

pilots<00:03:17.849> by<00:03:18.090> nature<00:03:18.650> will<00:03:19.650> go<00:03:20.099> to<00:03:20.160> any<00:03:20.609> extreme

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
pilots by nature will go to any extreme

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.699 
pilots by nature will go to any extreme
if<00:03:21.840> I<00:03:21.989> had<00:03:22.200> a<00:03:22.230> good<00:03:22.500> place<00:03:22.769> right<00:03:24.500> and<00:03:25.500> that's

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
if I had a good place right and that's

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:30.289 
if I had a good place right and that's
what<00:03:25.919> you<00:03:26.069> did<00:03:28.459> but<00:03:29.459> we<00:03:29.609> would<00:03:29.760> like<00:03:29.940> to<00:03:30.000> know

00:03:30.289 --> 00:03:30.299 
what you did but we would like to know

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:32.360 
what you did but we would like to know
from<00:03:31.109> you<00:03:31.230> Neil

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
from you Neil

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:35.420 
from you Neil
what<00:03:33.000> it<00:03:33.120> was<00:03:33.269> like<00:03:33.510> to<00:03:33.900> step<00:03:34.349> onto<00:03:34.680> that<00:03:35.160> moon

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
what it was like to step onto that moon

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:38.120 
what it was like to step onto that moon
and<00:03:35.819> turn<00:03:36.120> around<00:03:36.900> and<00:03:37.290> take<00:03:37.680> your<00:03:37.889> first

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 
and turn around and take your first

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:42.319 
and turn around and take your first
steps<00:03:38.519> and<00:03:39.349> really<00:03:40.349> learn<00:03:40.709> how<00:03:40.739> to<00:03:40.980> walk<00:03:41.340> and

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:42.329 
steps and really learn how to walk and

00:03:42.329 --> 00:03:46.640 
steps and really learn how to walk and
to<00:03:42.480> traverse<00:03:42.840> on<00:03:43.109> the<00:03:43.230> surface<00:03:43.970> we<00:03:44.970> had<00:03:45.299> a<00:03:45.959> few

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
to traverse on the surface we had a few

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.220 
to traverse on the surface we had a few
people<00:03:46.829> that<00:03:47.220> thought<00:03:48.060> it<00:03:48.480> was<00:03:48.540> going<00:03:48.930> to<00:03:49.019> be

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
people that thought it was going to be

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:52.580 
people that thought it was going to be
very<00:03:49.590> difficult<00:03:49.950> to<00:03:50.660> walk<00:03:51.660> on<00:03:51.930> the<00:03:52.079> surface<00:03:52.470> of

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
very difficult to walk on the surface of

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:54.920 
very difficult to walk on the surface of
them<00:03:52.739> for<00:03:53.040> whatever<00:03:53.579> reasons<00:03:54.419> they<00:03:54.629> believe

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:54.930 
them for whatever reasons they believe

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.500 
them for whatever reasons they believe
that<00:03:55.109> to<00:03:55.169> be<00:03:55.319> true<00:03:55.440> and<00:03:56.190> our<00:03:56.669> simulation

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:57.510 
that to be true and our simulation

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.770 
that to be true and our simulation
sometimes<00:03:58.230> were<00:03:58.500> a<00:03:58.530> little<00:03:58.650> bit<00:03:59.010> difficult

00:03:59.770 --> 00:03:59.780 
sometimes were a little bit difficult

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:04.159 
sometimes were a little bit difficult
but<00:04:00.780> the<00:04:00.989> human<00:04:01.410> is<00:04:02.120> remarkably<00:04:03.120> adaptive<00:04:03.840> and

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:04.169 
but the human is remarkably adaptive and

00:04:04.169 --> 00:04:07.580 
but the human is remarkably adaptive and
what<00:04:04.980> we<00:04:05.099> found<00:04:05.340> out<00:04:05.639> was<00:04:06.629> that<00:04:06.660> by<00:04:07.169> the<00:04:07.230> time

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:07.590 
what we found out was that by the time

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:10.460 
what we found out was that by the time
we<00:04:07.889> had<00:04:08.220> just<00:04:08.609> stood<00:04:09.269> around<00:04:09.569> in<00:04:09.840> the<00:04:09.959> cockpit

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:10.470 
we had just stood around in the cockpit

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.470 
we had just stood around in the cockpit
for<00:04:10.500> a<00:04:10.769> couple<00:04:11.129> hours<00:04:11.400> we<00:04:11.699> were<00:04:11.940> completely

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
for a couple hours we were completely

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.770 
for a couple hours we were completely
adapted<00:04:13.199> and<00:04:13.379> when<00:04:13.739> we<00:04:13.829> walked<00:04:14.099> down<00:04:14.310> off<00:04:14.639> of

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:14.780 
adapted and when we walked down off of

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:18.199 
adapted and when we walked down off of
the<00:04:15.780> craft<00:04:16.079> onto<00:04:16.560> the<00:04:16.650> surface<00:04:17.039> we<00:04:17.579> already

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
the craft onto the surface we already

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:19.699 
the craft onto the surface we already
were<00:04:18.479> right<00:04:18.810> at<00:04:18.989> home

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709 
were right at home

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:26.960 
were right at home
and<00:04:20.419> you<00:04:21.419> really<00:04:21.870> like<00:04:22.109> it<00:04:23.509> a<00:04:25.580> lot<00:04:26.580> of<00:04:26.729> folks

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 
and you really like it a lot of folks

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:29.089 
and you really like it a lot of folks

have asked me well you must be a real
risk<00:04:29.460> taker<00:04:29.819> and<00:04:30.229> I<00:04:31.229> really<00:04:31.530> don't<00:04:31.710> think

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:31.770 
risk taker and I really don't think

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:33.260 
risk taker and I really don't think
that's<00:04:32.069> true<00:04:32.370> I<00:04:32.400> think<00:04:32.729> I'm<00:04:32.819> probably<00:04:33.000> one<00:04:33.240> of

00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:33.270 
that's true I think I'm probably one of

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:34.820 
that's true I think I'm probably one of
the<00:04:33.389> most<00:04:33.449> safety<00:04:33.750> conscious<00:04:34.080> people<00:04:34.620> that<00:04:34.800> I

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:34.830 
the most safety conscious people that I

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:38.240 
the most safety conscious people that I
know<00:04:35.150> what<00:04:36.150> I<00:04:36.180> think<00:04:36.479> I<00:04:36.599> am<00:04:36.750> is<00:04:37.020> an<00:04:37.470> opportunity

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:38.250 
know what I think I am is an opportunity

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:40.730 
know what I think I am is an opportunity
seeker<00:04:38.819> and<00:04:39.060> I<00:04:39.330> think<00:04:39.599> that's<00:04:39.840> what<00:04:40.349> has<00:04:40.500> led

00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:40.740 
seeker and I think that's what has led

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:44.089 
seeker and I think that's what has led
me<00:04:41.419> to<00:04:42.419> be<00:04:42.539> part<00:04:42.780> of<00:04:42.930> the<00:04:43.020> astronaut<00:04:43.500> corps<00:04:43.770> and

00:04:44.089 --> 00:04:44.099 
me to be part of the astronaut corps and

00:04:44.099 --> 00:04:45.650 
me to be part of the astronaut corps and
to<00:04:44.370> some<00:04:44.669> of<00:04:44.789> the<00:04:44.849> other<00:04:45.030> things<00:04:45.300> that<00:04:45.479> I've

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:45.660 
to some of the other things that I've

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.080 
to some of the other things that I've
had<00:04:45.840> an<00:04:45.990> opportunity<00:04:46.289> to<00:04:46.680> do<00:04:46.949> and<00:04:47.250> so<00:04:47.819> I<00:04:47.849> guess

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:48.090 
had an opportunity to do and so I guess

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:50.629 
had an opportunity to do and so I guess
my<00:04:48.120> only<00:04:48.419> words<00:04:49.319> of<00:04:49.560> inspiration<00:04:50.280> to<00:04:50.310> an

00:05:23.749 --> 00:05:23.759 
of one guy with a car that would drive

00:05:23.759 --> 00:05:26.930 
of one guy with a car that would drive
out<00:05:23.789> to<00:05:24.150> the<00:05:24.240> drop<00:05:24.449> zone<00:05:24.479> each<00:05:24.930> weekend<00:05:25.820> but<00:05:26.820> it

00:05:29.009 --> 00:05:31.040 
turns out so I called that number and I
started<00:05:29.430> that<00:05:29.550> and<00:05:29.789> that's<00:05:29.940> what<00:05:30.210> got<00:05:30.419> me<00:05:30.449> into

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:31.050

responded<00:05:41.310> to<00:05:41.340> it

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:41.820 
responded to it

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:44.149 
responded to it
had<00:05:42.120> I<00:05:42.150> not<00:05:42.389> sought<00:05:42.840> out<00:05:43.050> that<00:05:43.289> opportunity

00:05:44.149 --> 00:05:44.159 
had I not sought out that opportunity

00:05:44.159 --> 00:05:47.839 
had I not sought out that opportunity
this<00:05:44.759> whole<00:05:45.030> world<00:05:45.440> that<00:05:46.440> became<00:05:47.099> open<00:05:47.490> to<00:05:47.520> me

00:05:47.839 --> 00:05:47.849 
this whole world that became open to me

00:05:47.849 --> 00:05:50.420 
this whole world that became open to me
you<00:05:48.150> know<00:05:48.270> a<00:05:48.509> decade<00:05:49.139> later<00:05:49.349> would<00:05:50.070> not<00:05:50.250> have

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:50.430 
you know a decade later would not have

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:52.430 
you know a decade later would not have
become<00:05:50.729> open<00:05:51.060> to<00:05:51.120> me<00:05:51.389> and<00:05:51.570> so<00:05:52.020> I<00:05:52.050> guess<00:05:52.229> that's

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:52.440 
become open to me and so I guess that's

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:54.469 
become open to me and so I guess that's
my<00:05:52.620> only<00:05:52.770> words<00:05:53.099> of<00:05:53.250> inspiration<00:05:53.520> is<00:05:54.150> keep
