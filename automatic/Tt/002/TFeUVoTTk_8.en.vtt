00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:32.660 
you pronounce it he's a center defensive

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:35.920 
you pronounce it he's a center defensive
mid<00:00:32.840> from<00:00:33.080> PSG<00:00:33.739> and<00:00:34.040> i<00:00:34.640> also<00:00:34.820> get<00:00:35.059> Joe<00:00:35.330> Hart<00:00:35.629> so

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:35.930 
mid from PSG and i also get Joe Hart so

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.020 
mid from PSG and i also get Joe Hart so
I<00:00:35.960> was<00:00:36.140> pretty<00:00:36.260> happy<00:00:36.500> about<00:00:36.680> that<00:00:36.860> and<00:00:37.280> the

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:38.030 
I was pretty happy about that and the

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:39.910 
I was pretty happy about that and the
center<00:00:38.360> defensive<00:00:38.840> mid<00:00:39.050> he<00:00:39.290> ended<00:00:39.530> up<00:00:39.649> going

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:39.920 
center defensive mid he ended up going

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.819 
center defensive mid he ended up going
for<00:00:40.160> 30,000<00:00:40.969> he's<00:00:41.120> only<00:00:41.360> 79<00:00:42.020> overall<00:00:42.530> and

00:00:42.819 --> 00:00:42.829 
for 30,000 he's only 79 overall and

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:46.240 
for 30,000 he's only 79 overall and
maybe<00:00:43.640> because<00:00:44.059> he's<00:00:44.210> a<00:00:44.239> 4<00:00:44.510> 12<00:00:44.840> 12<00:00:45.140> but<00:00:45.469> there

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:46.250 
maybe because he's a 4 12 12 but there

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:47.650 
maybe because he's a 4 12 12 but there
weren't<00:00:46.430> many<00:00:46.610> on<00:00:46.820> the<00:00:46.910> market<00:00:47.270> when<00:00:47.390> I<00:00:47.420> got

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.290 
weren't many on the market when I got
him<00:00:47.930> so<00:00:48.230> I<00:00:48.500> pretty<00:00:49.430> much<00:00:49.550> died<00:00:49.879> he<00:00:50.059> would<00:00:50.180> go

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:50.300 
him so I pretty much died he would go

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.060 
him so I pretty much died he would go
for<00:00:50.540> discard<00:00:50.930> valium<00:00:51.320> to<00:00:51.440> see<00:00:51.620> that<00:00:51.800> he<00:00:51.950> was
