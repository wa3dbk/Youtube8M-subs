00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:07.080
 Italian moments a bit 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:11.820
 vitello tonnato vitello veal roast 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:14.070
 tonnato tuna castrati already done 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.640
 Please do that one day before 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:21.529
 take a look at this splendor 

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:24.810
 calf back called with salt and pepper 

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:26.150
 a little bit of laurel 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.039
 I always do that a bit 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:31.980
 lemon juice high on it all at 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:35.840
 low temperature 120 minutes 120 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:38.820
 degree with core thermometer to 54 degrees 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:42.770
 It takes about an hour to get there 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:46.620
 very well take out alufoil 

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:47.420
 let stand cold on the best day 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.620
 before 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:53.309
 then the castrate is just like him now 

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:56.219
 is that I have then cut to 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:01:01.770
 a plate and does not matter at all 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:03.629
 her per serving per person without her 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.769
 makes a big plate for all those 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.200
 just in the middle of the table 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:10.049
 does not matter matter 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:13.680
 sharp knife cut paper-thin 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:15.420
 so that somehow you can have one 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.280
 reasonable kitchen machine is at home 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.030
 of course, that's okay and looks 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.180
 look at this 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:24.930
 So the color may be so delicious juicy 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:27.229
 we come to the sauce the simplest 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:30.840
 Anyone next to mayonnaise 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:33.119
 I now have that here 

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:37.500
 convenience product that is one 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:39.540
 finished mayonnaise of course and that is 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.829
 that could not be bad either 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.520
 I can do it again myself 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:45.899
 show soon on our channel 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:48.390
 I really like you 

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:49.979
 the bought because mayonnaise fresh 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.920
 eggs and raw is always a bit 

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:56.820
 driven product if i am for guests 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:58.140
 I prefer to take it that way 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.729
 little preservatives inside 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.899
 I can stand that because I have 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.689
 a bit respectful of that 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:07.520
 high in this one we read 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:10.760
 little tuna from the relationship 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:14.280
 a quarter mayonnaise 

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:17.069
 and a quarter so the whole and of it 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:18.959
 a quarter then the tuna that gives 

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:20.790
 we just give it on top of it 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:22.200
 we have cup of drivers from the glass in 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.590
 different sizes 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:28.590
 I have the fine little ones now 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:30.870
 about a spoon kaapanda again 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.970
 on top of what we still need is one 

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:36.720
 bit of lemon juice from a fresh one 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:38.640
 lemon that just the way it is a 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.900
 few small syringe here is a small one 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:41.900
 fritter tuna we would have times 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:47.069
 salt has little salt because the tuna has 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.620
 always a little something hertha 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:51.750
 mÃ¼ller and that's actually it 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.230
 entire mystery what we still have 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:57.090
 need is a little magic wand 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.450
 small is a small kitchen machine 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:00.329
 to lead 

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:02.239
 that's what it's all about now 

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:04.650
 grind 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:06.870
 I now give the caravan the taste 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:10.379
 from the cards also mix salt 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:15.290
 your just like with lemon of 

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:15.290
 Tuna is the principle that 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:25.320
 that does not have to be complete 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:27.660
 be crushed I think it actually 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:30.090
 Always nice when you are in the end too 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:32.640
 still, what do you even know everything like that 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:36.030
 then we take ours 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:38.820
 plate we take a normal dish 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:43.050
 spoon take our panties and now 

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:44.070
 on our roast only the sauce 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:46.770
 to distribute 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:48.360
 There are many when I'm somewhere myself 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:49.830
 go to eat the make the vitello 

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:51.090
 tonnato who stroke the meat 

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:53.550
 completely 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:55.140
 With this sauce I always like to leave it 

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:58.320
 a bit out on the sides 

00:03:55.140 --> 00:04:01.560
 because I'm just mia big 

00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:03.900
 have trouble given this this 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:05.370
 Roast veal a bit juicy and pink 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.500
 to advise if i give you the complete 

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:10.050
 paste so that sauce I think that 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:12.510
 almost a pity of course that was now the 

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:14.010
 Presentations for moment is here now 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:16.320
 just stuck that way like that 

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:19.380
 It looks better again at the end 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:22.500
 Take our bodies again, of course 

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:25.260
 who likes can hijack up here too 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:27.810
 Of course, the apples on it give that 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:29.760
 are the larger the style as a 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:33.650
 Couple I'm still doing a bit 

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:35.760
 Peppermill on it so for the eye and then 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:37.980
 70s style 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.540
 that's always a bit of her 

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:42.780
 she certainly knows all the slides 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:44.460
 advertising na when the kasseler her hers 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:46.590
 feed crawls subject mama from then 

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:50.610
 To brazil or serbia two children 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:52.919
 this is 70s style that is for 

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:54.240
 completely superfluous but already 

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:56.010
 so iconic that I can do that 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:58.530
 have a nice time so have ours 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:00.720
 error made by this I show you 

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:02.550
 that works that we take one 

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:04.830
 relatively solid tomato we take one 

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:07.800
 peeler and we go at the bloom 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:09.419
 where the style is there we go in and 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:11.640
 Do not just not press now 

00:05:09.419 --> 00:05:13.710
 squeeze rather a bit 

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:15.450
 Blessing like some 

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:17.700
 hedge trimmer then the blade is running 

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:20.300
 always back and forth and we try 

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:23.100
 now left the tomato bowl 

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:25.220
 to peel north Germany without that 

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:27.510
 she breaks us always nice 

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:30.240
 evenly from the strength and so on 

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:33.539
 Let's see, let's go 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:37.530
 Red over once completely the tomato 

00:05:33.539 --> 00:05:39.569
 down that means we take care of that 

00:05:37.530 --> 00:05:41.280
 this cup does not break and now 

00:05:39.569 --> 00:05:41.819
 caution came again a look 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:44.069
 a little bit denser 

00:05:41.819 --> 00:05:46.830
 now we have here in principle the 

00:05:44.069 --> 00:05:48.870
 top side of the tomato 

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:51.509
 that's practically the head that's it 

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:53.580
 the end that just fell over that 

00:05:51.509 --> 00:05:55.650
 are important because we are 

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:58.770
 do not start with the end but 

00:05:55.650 --> 00:06:00.690
 logically with the beginning this is 

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:03.330
 the end here is the beginning and now 

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:05.430
 we want this tomato the peel 

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:09.599
 between the hands between the fingers 

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:12.300
 Just tell it to me again it 

00:06:09.599 --> 00:06:14.720
 It is not the yard. It is not the yard 

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:18.120
 star kitchen and it's just tomatoes 

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:20.069
 bowl and really delicious is the 

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:23.970
 Not even if I'm here now 

00:06:20.069 --> 00:06:25.349
 that's what it's all about and then it works 

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:26.940
 made it there we take us here 

00:06:25.349 --> 00:06:29.909
 so a basil I slide show yet 

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:31.380
 put it on the left and on the right 

00:06:29.909 --> 00:06:33.930
 then we already have so small 

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:34.830
 cottage and this tomato we 

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:36.840
 have played 

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:39.030
 we can quarters, the 

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:40.590
 core housing cut out into small 

00:06:39.030 --> 00:06:43.460
 dice and sprinkle over here 

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:46.440
 that's how it makes sense 

00:06:43.460 --> 00:06:49.680
 vitello tonnato very quickly the 

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:51.419
 kitchen you just have to get used to you 

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:53.909
 push this roast in time enough 

00:06:51.419 --> 00:06:55.590
 that the correctness is natural 

00:06:53.909 --> 00:06:56.729
 also lukewarm even if he is cold 

00:06:55.590 --> 00:07:01.020
 you cut the wonderful and 

00:06:56.729 --> 00:07:02.789
 started work antipasti quite whole 

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:06.030
 made no big at all fast 

00:07:02.789 --> 00:07:07.770
 art but delicious I suppose came 

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:10.199
 already looking forward to it I say 

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:12.150
 Thank you, I'm not one of the subscribers 

00:07:10.199 --> 00:07:14.930
 I am with you wish you something 

00:07:12.150 --> 00:07:14.930
 beautiful evening
