00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
thought was going to be like a

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.439 
thought was going to be like a
traditional<00:00:55.590> metal<00:00:55.770> gear<00:00:56.100> would<00:00:56.309> like<00:00:56.489> really

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
traditional metal gear would like really

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.540 
traditional metal gear would like really
awesome<00:00:57.750> graphics<00:00:58.140> and<00:00:58.260> stuff<00:00:58.320> like<00:00:58.500> that<00:00:58.559> but

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
awesome graphics and stuff like that but

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.639 
awesome graphics and stuff like that but
what<00:00:59.910> we<00:01:00.059> ended<00:01:00.270> up<00:01:00.329> getting<00:01:00.480> was<00:01:00.989> a<00:01:01.020> card<00:01:01.469> game

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
what we ended up getting was a card game

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.509 
what we ended up getting was a card game
so<00:01:02.579> this<00:01:03.030> this<00:01:03.750> card<00:01:04.080> game<00:01:04.320> it<00:01:04.559> could<00:01:05.189> be<00:01:05.339> fun

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
so this this card game it could be fun

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:06.980 
so this this card game it could be fun
there<00:01:05.729> were<00:01:05.820> some<00:01:06.030> times<00:01:06.240> where<00:01:06.420> I<00:01:06.510> where<00:01:06.900> you

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990 
there were some times where I where you

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.060 
there were some times where I where you
got<00:01:07.170> everything<00:01:07.500> was<00:01:07.740> working<00:01:07.920> just

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
got everything was working just

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.060 
got everything was working just
completely<00:01:08.729> as<00:01:09.630> it<00:01:09.780> was<00:01:09.900> supposed<00:01:09.990> to<00:01:10.290> but<00:01:10.979> the

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
completely as it was supposed to but the

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.520 
completely as it was supposed to but the
thing<00:01:11.100> is<00:01:11.250> that<00:01:11.549> it<00:01:12.299> was<00:01:12.630> mostly<00:01:13.049> a<00:01:13.170> little

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
thing is that it was mostly a little

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.440 
thing is that it was mostly a little
tedious<00:01:13.830> to<00:01:14.159> play<00:01:14.369> because<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.030> way<00:01:15.270> that

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
tedious to play because the way that

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.030 
tedious to play because the way that
they<00:01:15.570> structured<00:01:16.020> it<00:01:16.170> with<00:01:16.290> the<00:01:16.380> cost<00:01:16.650> system

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
they structured it with the cost system

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.190 
they structured it with the cost system
and<00:01:17.430> that<00:01:17.670> stuff<00:01:18.030> I<00:01:18.270> mean<00:01:18.509> even<00:01:18.540> made<00:01:18.960> fun<00:01:19.170> of

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
and that stuff I mean even made fun of

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.780 
and that stuff I mean even made fun of
the<00:01:19.320> cost<00:01:19.530> system<00:01:19.740> and<00:01:20.100> dinner<00:01:20.549> with<00:01:20.670> the

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
the cost system and dinner with the

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.429 
the cost system and dinner with the
snakes<00:01:21.060> it's<00:01:21.990> just<00:01:23.090> well<00:01:24.090> it<00:01:24.299> seemed<00:01:24.659> like<00:01:24.869> it

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
snakes it's just well it seemed like it

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.670 
snakes it's just well it seemed like it
wasn't<00:01:25.650> all<00:01:25.979> that<00:01:26.009> entertaining<00:01:26.460> to<00:01:27.000> play<00:01:27.210> and

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:27.680 
wasn't all that entertaining to play and

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.640 
wasn't all that entertaining to play and

toughest metal gear battles I'm not

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:37.399 
toughest metal gear battles I'm not
necessarily<00:01:36.630> tough<00:01:36.930> because<00:01:37.200> it<00:01:37.320> was

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
necessarily tough because it was

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.319 
necessarily tough because it was
challenging<00:01:37.650> that<00:01:38.549> was<00:01:38.729> tough<00:01:38.939> because<00:01:39.060> it

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
challenging that was tough because it

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:41.630 
challenging that was tough because it
was<00:01:39.450> a<00:01:39.479> pretty<00:01:39.900> cheap<00:01:40.200> because<00:01:41.070> he<00:01:41.340> had<00:01:41.490> this

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
was a pretty cheap because he had this

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.670 
was a pretty cheap because he had this
super<00:01:42.000> attack<00:01:42.299> where<00:01:43.049> you<00:01:43.350> were<00:01:43.439> you<00:01:43.590> were

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
super attack where you were you were

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.289 
super attack where you were you were
basically<00:01:43.799> finding<00:01:44.220> this<00:01:44.369> very<00:01:44.460> big<00:01:44.820> grid<00:01:45.060> ran

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
basically finding this very big grid ran

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:47.719 
basically finding this very big grid ran
and<00:01:45.450> it<00:01:45.509> had<00:01:45.659> this<00:01:45.780> um<00:01:46.049> attack<00:01:46.979> where<00:01:47.460> he<00:01:47.610> would

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
and it had this um attack where he would

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.510 
and it had this um attack where he would
just<00:01:47.880> jump<00:01:47.970> off<00:01:48.420> and<00:01:48.689> then<00:01:49.200> smash<00:01:49.770> down<00:01:50.070> and<00:01:50.399> he

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
just jump off and then smash down and he

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.700 
just jump off and then smash down and he
would<00:01:50.640> insta<00:01:51.090> kill<00:01:51.299> you<00:01:51.509> if<00:01:51.689> he<00:01:51.990> landed<00:01:52.409> on<00:01:52.500> top

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
would insta kill you if he landed on top

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:53.960 
would insta kill you if he landed on top
of<00:01:52.890> you<00:01:52.979> and<00:01:53.009> was<00:01:53.520> there<00:01:53.670> a<00:01:53.700> way<00:01:53.790> that<00:01:53.820> you

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
of you and was there a way that you

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.249 
of you and was there a way that you
could<00:01:54.180> kind<00:01:54.420> of<00:01:54.450> predict<00:01:54.780> where<00:01:54.960> he<00:01:55.020> would<00:01:55.140> let

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
could kind of predict where he would let

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.560 
could kind of predict where he would let
no<00:01:55.439> it<00:01:55.680> was<00:01:55.799> completely<00:01:56.399> random<00:01:56.700> so<00:01:57.329> you<00:01:57.420> just

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:57.570 
no it was completely random so you just

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:00.380 
no it was completely random so you just
had<00:01:57.719> to<00:01:57.810> get<00:01:57.960> lucky<00:01:58.200> and<00:01:59.060> hopefully<00:02:00.060> not<00:02:00.180> get

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
had to get lucky and hopefully not get

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:01.730 
had to get lucky and hopefully not get
squashed<00:02:00.659> by<00:02:00.899> him<00:02:01.049> when<00:02:01.229> he<00:02:01.290> jumps<00:02:01.530> up<00:02:01.649> and

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
squashed by him when he jumps up and

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.760 
squashed by him when he jumps up and
down<00:02:01.890> right<00:02:02.130> so<00:02:03.000> that<00:02:03.210> was<00:02:03.390> Metal<00:02:03.869> Gear<00:02:03.899> acid

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
down right so that was Metal Gear acid

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.310 
down right so that was Metal Gear acid
and<00:02:04.920> now<00:02:05.159> we're<00:02:05.310> going<00:02:05.399> to<00:02:05.460> be<00:02:05.579> talking<00:02:05.790> about

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:06.320 
and now we're going to be talking about

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.190 
and now we're going to be talking about
Metal<00:02:07.320> Gear<00:02:07.399> acid<00:02:08.399> squared<00:02:09.179> so<00:02:09.869> I'm<00:02:09.929> all<00:02:10.020> your

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
Metal Gear acid squared so I'm all your

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.420 
Metal Gear acid squared so I'm all your
assets<00:02:10.410> squared<00:02:10.770> you<00:02:10.920> know<00:02:11.039> as<00:02:11.129> it<00:02:11.280> says<00:02:11.400> in

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
assets squared you know as it says in

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.550 
assets squared you know as it says in
the<00:02:11.610> back<00:02:11.819> and

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:12.560 
the back and

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.380 
the back and
all<00:02:12.620> new<00:02:12.920> acid<00:02:13.640> trip<00:02:14.000> so<00:02:14.239> they<00:02:14.270> were

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
all new acid trip so they were

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.570 
all new acid trip so they were
definitely<00:02:14.630> going<00:02:14.930> for<00:02:15.530> the<00:02:15.590> whole<00:02:15.770> drug

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:16.580 
definitely going for the whole drug

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:19.540 
definitely going for the whole drug
hallucination<00:02:17.390> angle<00:02:17.690> huh<00:02:18.010> so<00:02:19.010> my<00:02:19.220> guess<00:02:19.430> is

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550 
hallucination angle huh so my guess is

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:21.910 
hallucination angle huh so my guess is
squared<00:02:19.970> its<00:02:20.239> streamlined<00:02:21.050> the<00:02:21.349> cart<00:02:21.590> system

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
squared its streamlined the cart system

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.170 
squared its streamlined the cart system
that<00:02:22.069> was<00:02:22.160> the<00:02:22.310> most<00:02:22.489> important<00:02:22.849> thing<00:02:23.000> that

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
that was the most important thing that

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.960 
that was the most important thing that
it<00:02:23.300> did<00:02:23.480> because<00:02:24.380> as<00:02:24.770> I<00:02:25.190> said<00:02:25.250> in<00:02:25.520> the<00:02:25.550> with

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
it did because as I said in the with

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:27.670 
it did because as I said in the with
this<00:02:26.120> one<00:02:26.360> it<00:02:26.569> was<00:02:26.660> very<00:02:26.870> complex<00:02:27.319> to<00:02:27.560> do

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
this one it was very complex to do

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.339 
this one it was very complex to do
anything<00:02:27.890> here<00:02:28.370> it<00:02:28.520> was<00:02:29.090> a<00:02:29.120> little<00:02:29.989> simpler<00:02:30.319> a

00:02:30.339 --> 00:02:30.349 
anything here it was a little simpler a

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:31.930 
anything here it was a little simpler a
little<00:02:30.590> more<00:02:30.739> straightforward<00:02:31.489> and<00:02:31.730> it<00:02:31.849> was

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:31.940 
little more straightforward and it was

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.280 
little more straightforward and it was
definitely<00:02:32.120> i<00:02:32.360> remember<00:02:32.750> playing<00:02:32.780> it<00:02:33.170> was<00:02:33.230> a

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290 
definitely i remember playing it was a

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:34.960 
definitely i remember playing it was a
lot<00:02:33.470> more<00:02:33.590> dynamic<00:02:34.190> this<00:02:34.340> one<00:02:34.459> I<00:02:34.489> had<00:02:34.670> a<00:02:34.700> lot

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:34.970 
lot more dynamic this one I had a lot

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:37.180 
lot more dynamic this one I had a lot
more<00:02:35.000> fun<00:02:35.330> with<00:02:35.540> than<00:02:36.050> metal<00:02:36.500> gear<00:02:36.709> acid<00:02:37.040> and

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:37.190 
more fun with than metal gear acid and

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:39.520 
more fun with than metal gear acid and
also<00:02:37.430> the<00:02:37.519> graphic<00:02:37.970> style<00:02:38.330> changed<00:02:38.870> a<00:02:38.930> lot<00:02:39.080> now

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
also the graphic style changed a lot now

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.110 
also the graphic style changed a lot now
was<00:02:39.709> accelerated<00:02:40.430> graphics<00:02:40.580> and<00:02:40.970> really

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120 
was accelerated graphics and really

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.880 
was accelerated graphics and really
bright<00:02:41.390> kind<00:02:41.720> of<00:02:41.780> like<00:02:41.900> wind<00:02:42.140> wakers<00:02:42.440> style

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:42.890 
bright kind of like wind wakers style

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.400 
bright kind of like wind wakers style
but<00:02:43.250> it<00:02:43.459> still<00:02:43.940> wasn't<00:02:44.269> a<00:02:44.480> traditional<00:02:45.049> metal

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.410 
but it still wasn't a traditional metal

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.979 
but it still wasn't a traditional metal
gear<00:02:45.739> and<00:02:45.860> I<00:02:46.310> really<00:02:47.209> wanted<00:02:47.480> to<00:02:47.540> play<00:02:47.630> our

00:02:47.979 --> 00:02:47.989 
gear and I really wanted to play our

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:49.449 
gear and I really wanted to play our
traditional<00:02:48.440> metal<00:02:48.620> gear<00:02:48.890> with<00:02:49.100> stealth

00:02:49.449 --> 00:02:49.459 
traditional metal gear with stealth

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:51.789 
traditional metal gear with stealth
action<00:02:49.670> and<00:02:50.000> all<00:02:50.150> that<00:02:50.330> stuff<00:02:50.510> on<00:02:50.900> my<00:02:51.350> PSP

00:02:51.789 --> 00:02:51.799 
action and all that stuff on my PSP

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:53.590 
action and all that stuff on my PSP
that's<00:02:52.160> mainly<00:02:52.430> why<00:02:52.640> I<00:02:52.670> got<00:02:52.940> a<00:02:52.970> PSP<00:02:53.299> was

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:53.600 
that's mainly why I got a PSP was

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.180 
that's mainly why I got a PSP was
because<00:02:53.870> I<00:02:53.900> knew<00:02:54.110> could<00:02:54.319> play<00:02:54.500> metal<00:02:54.799> gear<00:02:54.860> on

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:55.190 
because I knew could play metal gear on

00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:57.699 
because I knew could play metal gear on
the<00:02:55.220> go<00:02:55.549> now<00:02:55.790> so<00:02:56.630> that<00:02:56.900> was<00:02:57.049> Melek<00:02:57.349> your<00:02:57.470> asset

00:02:57.699 --> 00:02:57.709 
the go now so that was Melek your asset

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:00.460 
the go now so that was Melek your asset
squared<00:02:57.980> and<00:02:58.599> Metal<00:02:59.599> Gear<00:02:59.660> Solid<00:02:59.930> digital

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
graphic novel uh it was um it wasn't

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.710 
graphic novel uh it was um it wasn't
really<00:03:03.440> a<00:03:03.470> game<00:03:03.799> right<00:03:04.430> what<00:03:04.940> what<00:03:05.269> this<00:03:05.450> was

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 
really a game right what what this was

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.860 
really a game right what what this was
is<00:03:06.019> that<00:03:06.709> Ashley<00:03:07.340> would<00:03:07.480> she<00:03:08.480> took<00:03:08.660> out<00:03:08.810> a

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
is that Ashley would she took out a

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:10.720 
is that Ashley would she took out a
series<00:03:09.470> of<00:03:09.650> comics<00:03:10.040> and<00:03:10.190> then<00:03:10.280> they<00:03:10.370> compile

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
series of comics and then they compile

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:13.990 
series of comics and then they compile
them<00:03:10.910> into<00:03:10.970> one<00:03:11.239> and<00:03:11.920> what<00:03:12.920> this<00:03:13.130> did<00:03:13.459> is<00:03:13.700> that

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:14.000 
them into one and what this did is that

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.479 
them into one and what this did is that
it<00:03:14.209> put<00:03:14.420> them<00:03:14.569> all<00:03:14.810> into<00:03:14.989> one<00:03:15.110> UMD<00:03:15.920> disk<00:03:16.190> and

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:16.489 
it put them all into one UMD disk and

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:18.340 
it put them all into one UMD disk and
input<00:03:17.150> little<00:03:17.359> special<00:03:17.660> features<00:03:17.989> where<00:03:18.230> you

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:18.350 
input little special features where you

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:56.249 
our portable we all love middle gear now
we've<00:04:54.669> always<00:04:54.879> want<00:04:55.240> to<00:04:55.389> love<00:04:55.599> things<00:04:55.930> metal

00:04:56.249 --> 00:04:56.259 
we've always want to love things metal

00:04:56.259 --> 00:04:57.809 
we've always want to love things metal
gear<00:04:56.499> even<00:04:57.069> when<00:04:57.189> they're<00:04:57.310> not<00:04:57.340> that<00:04:57.610> great

00:04:57.809 --> 00:04:57.819 
gear even when they're not that great

00:04:57.819 --> 00:04:59.879 
gear even when they're not that great
and<00:04:58.120> I<00:04:58.240> feel<00:04:58.270> that<00:04:59.080> portable<00:04:59.439> ops<00:04:59.710> is

00:04:59.879 --> 00:04:59.889 
and I feel that portable ops is

00:04:59.889 --> 00:05:02.279 
and I feel that portable ops is
definitely<00:05:00.490> one<00:05:01.180> of<00:05:01.210> the<00:05:01.419> weakest<00:05:01.870> games<00:05:02.110> in

00:05:02.279 --> 00:05:02.289 
definitely one of the weakest games in

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:04.589 
definitely one of the weakest games in
the<00:05:02.379> series<00:05:02.620> if<00:05:03.039> not<00:05:03.520> the<00:05:03.789> weakest<00:05:04.210> game

00:05:04.589 --> 00:05:04.599 
the series if not the weakest game

00:05:04.599 --> 00:05:06.779 
the series if not the weakest game
because<00:05:05.560> there<00:05:05.860> was<00:05:05.979> a<00:05:06.009> lot<00:05:06.279> of<00:05:06.310> problems<00:05:06.729> with

00:05:06.779 --> 00:05:06.789 
because there was a lot of problems with

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:08.820 
because there was a lot of problems with
a<00:05:06.909> lot<00:05:07.240> of<00:05:07.270> problems<00:05:07.599> that<00:05:07.629> I<00:05:07.719> feel<00:05:07.990> a<00:05:08.259> lot<00:05:08.590> of

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:08.830 
a lot of problems that I feel a lot of

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:10.200 
a lot of problems that I feel a lot of
people<00:05:09.069> were<00:05:09.189> kind<00:05:09.400> of<00:05:09.430> ignoring<00:05:09.729> because<00:05:10.090> it

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:10.210 
people were kind of ignoring because it

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:13.200 
people were kind of ignoring because it
was<00:05:10.330> metal<00:05:10.569> gear<00:05:10.750> run<00:05:11.620> him<00:05:11.680> down<00:05:11.740> here<00:05:12.219> so<00:05:13.060> for

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:09.460 
mission and the level design was really

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:12.510 
mission and the level design was really
really<00:06:10.449> boring<00:06:10.779> it<00:06:11.080> was<00:06:11.649> really<00:06:11.860> bland<00:06:12.219> and

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:12.520 
really boring it was really bland and

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:13.750 
you could tell that they designed this

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:15.749 
you could tell that they designed this
game<00:06:14.020> for<00:06:14.409> the<00:06:14.649> multiplayer<00:06:15.099> experience

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:19.330 
people and i never got that about metal

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:20.760 
people and i never got that about metal
gear<00:06:19.539> like<00:06:19.779> you<00:06:19.960> know<00:06:20.050> when<00:06:20.199> they've<00:06:20.319> had<00:06:20.349> it

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:20.770 
gear like you know when they've had it

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:22.350 
gear like you know when they've had it
in<00:06:20.889> subsistence<00:06:21.250> because<00:06:21.729> i<00:06:21.759> think<00:06:21.969> metal

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:22.360 
in subsistence because i think metal

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:23.429 
in subsistence because i think metal
gear<00:06:22.479> is<00:06:22.539> not<00:06:22.689> about<00:06:22.839> just<00:06:23.110> running<00:06:23.349> around

00:06:23.429 --> 00:06:23.439 
gear is not about just running around
