technology and in human talent and
know-how<00:00:19.390> in<00:00:19.689> this<00:00:20.080> building<00:00:20.560> it<00:00:20.980> is<00:00:21.190> focused

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:21.880 
know-how in this building it is focused

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:24.570 
know-how in this building it is focused
on<00:00:22.090> how<00:00:22.420> to<00:00:22.450> make<00:00:22.810> the<00:00:23.260> very<00:00:23.650> challenging

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:24.580 
on how to make the very challenging

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:28.260 
on how to make the very challenging
aerospace<00:00:25.300> parts<00:00:26.070> other<00:00:27.070> industries<00:00:27.820> as<00:00:28.029> well

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:28.270 
aerospace parts other industries as well

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:31.349 
aerospace parts other industries as well
but<00:00:28.449> really<00:00:28.840> focus<00:00:29.470> on<00:00:29.710> aerospace<00:00:30.550> type<00:00:30.880> parts

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:31.359 
but really focus on aerospace type parts

00:00:31.359 --> 00:00:34.319 
but really focus on aerospace type parts
and<00:00:31.570> it<00:00:31.960> takes<00:00:32.320> a<00:00:32.649> culmination<00:00:33.640> of<00:00:33.940> all<00:00:34.120> these

00:00:34.319 --> 00:00:34.329 
and it takes a culmination of all these

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:36.869 
and it takes a culmination of all these
talents<00:00:34.960> and<00:00:35.109> skill<00:00:35.469> sets<00:00:35.500> to<00:00:36.460> really<00:00:36.609> make

00:00:36.869 --> 00:00:36.879 
talents and skill sets to really make

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:39.509 
talents and skill sets to really make
this<00:00:37.030> happen<00:00:37.089> the<00:00:37.929> machines<00:00:38.379> here<00:00:38.769> are<00:00:39.010> used

00:00:39.509 --> 00:00:39.519 
this happen the machines here are used

00:00:39.519 --> 00:00:42.779 
this happen the machines here are used
to<00:00:39.879> test<00:00:40.269> and<00:00:40.659> evaluate<00:00:40.780> those<00:00:41.679> parts<00:00:42.219> and<00:00:42.429> to

00:00:42.779 --> 00:00:42.789 
to test and evaluate those parts and to

00:00:42.789 --> 00:00:45.770 
to test and evaluate those parts and to
test<00:00:43.179> out<00:00:43.510> procedures<00:00:44.260> and<00:00:44.530> processes

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
test out procedures and processes

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.149 
test out procedures and processes
companies<00:00:46.780> can't<00:00:47.289> make<00:00:47.530> this<00:00:47.739> large

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:48.159 
companies can't make this large

00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:51.000 
companies can't make this large
investments<00:00:48.999> just<00:00:49.239> to<00:00:49.479> try<00:00:49.839> things<00:00:50.170> out<00:00:50.440> so

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:51.010 
investments just to try things out so

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:53.340 
investments just to try things out so
this<00:00:51.190> Center<00:00:51.609> was<00:00:51.789> created<00:00:52.539> so<00:00:52.719> we<00:00:52.870> could<00:00:53.079> test

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:53.350 
this Center was created so we could test

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:56.459 
this Center was created so we could test
things<00:00:53.969> evaluate<00:00:54.969> them<00:00:55.179> check<00:00:55.899> the<00:00:56.109> accuracy

00:00:56.459 --> 00:00:56.469 
things evaluate them check the accuracy

00:00:56.469 --> 00:01:00.149 
things evaluate them check the accuracy
check<00:00:56.979> and<00:00:57.729> see<00:00:57.909> the<00:00:58.089> effectiveness<00:00:58.889> tweak<00:00:59.889> it

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:00.159 
check and see the effectiveness tweak it

00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:02.340 
check and see the effectiveness tweak it
work<00:01:00.639> on<00:01:00.909> it<00:01:01.120> make<00:01:01.659> it<00:01:01.899> better

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:02.350 
work on it make it better

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:04.820 
work on it make it better
that's<00:01:02.889> why<00:01:03.100> this<00:01:03.159> Center<00:01:03.609> was<00:01:03.789> put<00:01:04.059> in<00:01:04.180> place

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
that's why this Center was put in place

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.590 
that's why this Center was put in place
strictly<00:01:05.830> to<00:01:06.310> support<00:01:06.729> this<00:01:06.909> aerospace

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:07.600 
strictly to support this aerospace

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.190 
strictly to support this aerospace
center<00:01:08.080> it<00:01:08.890> takes<00:01:09.220> partners<00:01:10.210> to<00:01:10.870> make<00:01:11.020> this

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:11.200 
center it takes partners to make this

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.990 
center it takes partners to make this
happen<00:01:11.680> as<00:01:11.830> well<00:01:12.010> because<00:01:12.370> it's<00:01:12.610> not<00:01:12.820> only

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:13.000 
happen as well because it's not only

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.540 
happen as well because it's not only
about<00:01:13.300> the<00:01:13.630> machines<00:01:14.050> and<00:01:14.470> about<00:01:14.980> the<00:01:15.160> parts

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:15.550 
about the machines and about the parts

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:18.150 
about the machines and about the parts
it's<00:01:15.940> the<00:01:16.300> other<00:01:16.570> technologies<00:01:17.530> that<00:01:17.770> apply

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:18.160 
it's the other technologies that apply

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.630 
it's the other technologies that apply
so<00:01:18.790> we<00:01:18.970> have<00:01:19.210> a<00:01:19.540> whole<00:01:20.200> partnership<00:01:20.890> we're

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:21.640 
so we have a whole partnership we're

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.550 
so we have a whole partnership we're
using<00:01:21.820> some<00:01:22.270> of<00:01:22.300> the<00:01:22.480> partners<00:01:22.930> from<00:01:23.080> partners

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:23.560 
using some of the partners from partners

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.010 
using some of the partners from partners
and<00:01:23.770> think<00:01:24.010> some<00:01:24.610> partners<00:01:25.120> from<00:01:25.360> outside<00:01:25.810> of

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:26.020 
and think some partners from outside of

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.050 
and think some partners from outside of
partners<00:01:26.380> and<00:01:26.530> thing<00:01:26.770> that<00:01:26.980> really<00:01:27.460> relate<00:01:28.030> to

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:28.060 
partners and thing that really relate to

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.570 
partners and thing that really relate to
the<00:01:28.450> aerospace<00:01:28.900> industry<00:01:29.200> and<00:01:29.890> the<00:01:29.980> needs<00:01:30.250> of

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:30.580 
the aerospace industry and the needs of

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:35.370 
the aerospace industry and the needs of
this<00:01:30.970> very<00:01:31.650> specific<00:01:32.650> industry<00:01:33.490> sector<00:01:34.380> so

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
this very specific industry sector so

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:37.320 
this very specific industry sector so
now<00:01:35.530> we're<00:01:35.740> in<00:01:35.860> a<00:01:35.890> metrology<00:01:36.550> lab<00:01:36.580> and<00:01:37.090> in<00:01:37.210> this

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:37.330 
now we're in a metrology lab and in this

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:41.460 
now we're in a metrology lab and in this
lab<00:01:37.720> we<00:01:38.050> validate<00:01:38.950> we<00:01:39.250> check<00:01:39.820> we<00:01:40.570> ensure<00:01:41.200> that

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:41.470 
lab we validate we check we ensure that

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:44.070 
lab we validate we check we ensure that
those<00:01:41.620> critical<00:01:42.310> dimensions<00:01:42.880> those<00:01:43.390> critical

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:44.080 
those critical dimensions those critical

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.050 
those critical dimensions those critical
characteristics<00:01:45.070> are<00:01:45.250> those<00:01:45.370> aerospace

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 
characteristics are those aerospace

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.080
