okay today we are doing is we are making
a<00:00:09.940> test<00:00:10.660> prop<00:00:10.990> I<00:00:13.020> put<00:00:14.020> my<00:00:14.140> lower<00:00:14.320> unit<00:00:14.680> back

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:14.860 
a test prop I put my lower unit back

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:20.700 
a test prop I put my lower unit back
together<00:00:15.070> and<00:00:15.960> I<00:00:18.029> need<00:00:19.029> to<00:00:19.439> still<00:00:20.439> work<00:00:20.560> on

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:20.710 
together and I need to still work on

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:22.439 
together and I need to still work on
setting<00:00:21.070> my<00:00:21.189> idle<00:00:21.519> and<00:00:21.669> everything<00:00:22.060> and<00:00:22.300> I

setting my idle and everything and I

00:00:22.449 --> 00:00:24.179 
setting my idle and everything and I
found<00:00:22.659> out<00:00:22.810> for<00:00:22.990> my<00:00:23.140> last<00:00:23.349> adventure<00:00:23.740> that<00:00:24.099> it

00:00:24.179 --> 00:00:24.189 
found out for my last adventure that it

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:26.640 
found out for my last adventure that it
was<00:00:24.359> kind<00:00:25.359> of<00:00:25.390> a<00:00:25.509> pain<00:00:25.749> in<00:00:25.869> the<00:00:25.960> ass<00:00:26.109> to<00:00:26.289> try<00:00:26.529> and

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:26.650 
was kind of a pain in the ass to try and

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:28.409 
was kind of a pain in the ass to try and
do<00:00:26.800> on<00:00:26.980> the<00:00:27.130> water<00:00:27.429> to<00:00:27.849> get<00:00:27.999> all<00:00:28.119> the<00:00:28.239> base

00:00:28.409 --> 00:00:28.419 
do on the water to get all the base

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:31.259 
do on the water to get all the base
stuff<00:00:28.749> set<00:00:29.019> setup<00:00:29.650> for<00:00:30.579> me<00:00:30.669> personally<00:00:30.880> maybe

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:31.269 
stuff set setup for me personally maybe

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:35.580 
stuff set setup for me personally maybe
for<00:00:31.480> somebody<00:00:31.749> else<00:00:31.929> that's<00:00:32.050> not<00:00:32.259> at<00:00:32.439> all<00:00:34.590> but

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:35.590 
for somebody else that's not at all but

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:37.740 
for somebody else that's not at all but
I'd<00:00:35.710> much<00:00:35.860> rather<00:00:35.920> use<00:00:36.490> a<00:00:36.520> test<00:00:36.910> tank<00:00:37.240> at<00:00:37.480> home

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:37.750 
I'd much rather use a test tank at home

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:41.160 
I'd much rather use a test tank at home
and<00:00:38.790> get<00:00:39.790> my<00:00:39.910> Idol<00:00:40.270> set<00:00:40.480> up<00:00:40.600> with<00:00:40.750> the<00:00:40.870> added

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:41.170 
and get my Idol set up with the added

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.310 
and get my Idol set up with the added
back<00:00:41.320> pressure<00:00:42.030> so<00:00:43.030> what<00:00:43.180> I<00:00:43.210> did<00:00:43.300> was<00:00:43.630> I<00:00:43.690> took<00:00:44.050> a

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:44.320 
back pressure so what I did was I took a

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:48.510 
back pressure so what I did was I took a
cold<00:00:45.090> 17<00:00:46.090> pitch<00:00:46.360> prop<00:00:46.690> I<00:00:46.870> have<00:00:47.050> here<00:00:47.380> I<00:00:47.560> might

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:48.520 
cold 17 pitch prop I have here I might

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:51.570 
cold 17 pitch prop I have here I might
take<00:00:48.610> 1/3<00:00:49.090> off<00:00:49.420> of<00:00:50.230> each<00:00:50.590> ear<00:00:51.040> and<00:00:51.070> kind<00:00:51.550> of

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:51.580 
take 1/3 off of each ear and kind of

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:56.100 
take 1/3 off of each ear and kind of
square<00:00:51.910> off<00:00:52.120> a<00:00:52.150> little<00:00:52.450> bit<00:00:54.120> so<00:00:55.120> that<00:00:55.150> it<00:00:55.810> still

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:56.110 
square off a little bit so that it still

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:57.630 
square off a little bit so that it still
works<00:00:56.350> but<00:00:56.590> it's<00:00:56.710> not<00:00:56.770> given<00:00:57.160> the<00:00:57.220> same<00:00:57.370> amount

00:00:57.630 --> 00:00:57.640 
works but it's not given the same amount

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.670 
works but it's not given the same amount
of<00:00:57.700> thrust<00:00:58.030> and<00:00:58.360> it's<00:00:58.600> getting<00:00:58.870> a<00:00:58.930> load<00:00:59.200> put<00:00:59.530> on

00:00:59.670 --> 00:00:59.680 
of thrust and it's getting a load put on

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:01.830 
of thrust and it's getting a load put on
it<00:01:00.000> something<00:01:01.000> similar<00:01:01.480> to<00:01:01.630> what<00:01:01.750> you're

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:01.840 
it something similar to what you're

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:02.819 
it something similar to what you're
going<00:01:01.960> to<00:01:01.990> get<00:01:02.140> in<00:01:02.200> the<00:01:02.260> water<00:01:02.440> but<00:01:02.680> not

00:01:02.819 --> 00:01:02.829 
going to get in the water but not

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:06.800 
going to get in the water but not
exactly<00:01:04.470> so<00:01:05.470> how<00:01:05.619> I<00:01:05.650> did<00:01:05.950> this<00:01:06.130> was<00:01:06.340> I

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
exactly so how I did this was I

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:13.070 
exactly so how I did this was I
basically<00:01:09.659> traced<00:01:10.659> out<00:01:10.980> one<00:01:11.980> of<00:01:12.010> the<00:01:12.190> blades

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
basically traced out one of the blades

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.730 
basically traced out one of the blades
here<00:01:14.190> and<00:01:15.240> then<00:01:16.240> marked<00:01:17.020> out<00:01:17.200> where<00:01:17.409> I<00:01:17.440> thought

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:17.740 
here and then marked out where I thought

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:19.320 
here and then marked out where I thought
about<00:01:17.920> a<00:01:17.980> third<00:01:18.310> was<00:01:18.550> to<00:01:18.729> kind<00:01:18.880> of<00:01:18.940> get<00:01:19.120> rid<00:01:19.270> of

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:19.330 
about a third was to kind of get rid of

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.469 
about a third was to kind of get rid of
this<00:01:19.510> nice<00:01:19.720> point<00:01:20.110> and<00:01:20.850> then<00:01:21.850> cut<00:01:22.240> that<00:01:22.420> out

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:22.479 
this nice point and then cut that out

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:26.910 
this nice point and then cut that out
and<00:01:23.020> I<00:01:23.560> traced<00:01:23.920> it<00:01:24.070> along<00:01:24.400> each<00:01:24.909> one<00:01:25.890> so<00:01:26.890> that

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:26.920 
and I traced it along each one so that

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.640 
and I traced it along each one so that
now<00:01:27.280> all<00:01:28.030> these<00:01:28.479> have<00:01:28.750> a<00:01:28.780> mark<00:01:29.140> on<00:01:29.290> them<00:01:29.500> and<00:01:29.620> I

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:29.650 
now all these have a mark on them and I

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:30.780 
now all these have a mark on them and I
don't<00:01:29.740> know<00:01:29.890> if<00:01:30.010> you<00:01:30.100> can<00:01:30.190> see<00:01:30.400> that<00:01:30.520> with<00:01:30.700> the

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:30.790 
don't know if you can see that with the

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:35.130 
don't know if you can see that with the
sunlight<00:01:31.150> or<00:01:31.300> not<00:01:33.030> each<00:01:34.030> one<00:01:34.090> has<00:01:34.570> a<00:01:34.600> mark<00:01:34.900> on

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:35.140 
sunlight or not each one has a mark on

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.440 
sunlight or not each one has a mark on
it<00:01:35.200> now<00:01:35.700> showing<00:01:36.700> where<00:01:36.940> I'm<00:01:37.030> going<00:01:37.180> to<00:01:37.240> cut

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.450 
it now showing where I'm going to cut

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:38.990 
it now showing where I'm going to cut
what<00:01:37.750> my<00:01:37.870> do<00:01:38.049> is<00:01:38.140> I'm<00:01:38.260> going<00:01:38.350> to<00:01:38.409> take<00:01:38.500> a

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
what my do is I'm going to take a

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.380 
what my do is I'm going to take a
sawzall<00:01:40.000> cut<00:01:40.630> through<00:01:40.870> this<00:01:40.930> just<00:01:41.170> aluminum

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
sawzall cut through this just aluminum

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.580 
sawzall cut through this just aluminum
and<00:01:43.390> then<00:01:43.479> I'm<00:01:43.600> gonna<00:01:43.690> take<00:01:43.810> my<00:01:43.870> grinder<00:01:44.440> and

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 
and then I'm gonna take my grinder and

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.219 
and then I'm gonna take my grinder and
kind<00:01:44.770> of<00:01:44.860> just<00:01:45.070> smooth<00:01:45.310> it<00:01:45.460> all<00:01:45.549> out<00:01:46.080> that<00:01:47.080> way

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:47.229 
kind of just smooth it all out that way

kind of just smooth it all out that way
I<00:01:47.260> have<00:01:47.530> an<00:01:47.680> extra<00:01:48.310> prop<00:01:48.610> because<00:01:48.850> this<00:01:48.970> one's

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:49.150 
I have an extra prop because this one's

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:50.640 
I have an extra prop because this one's
kind<00:01:49.330> of<00:01:49.360> dinged<00:01:49.630> up<00:01:49.810> to<00:01:50.049> missing<00:01:50.320> some<00:01:50.530> teeth

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:50.650 
kind of dinged up to missing some teeth

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:54.000 
kind of dinged up to missing some teeth
and<00:01:51.549> stuff<00:01:51.850> like<00:01:52.030> that<00:01:52.299> so<00:01:53.049> that<00:01:53.170> I<00:01:53.229> can<00:01:53.530> put<00:01:53.979> on

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:58.950 
the back of the boat when I make this
test<00:01:55.900> tank<00:01:56.940> I'm<00:01:57.940> gonna<00:01:58.119> start<00:01:58.330> hacking<00:01:58.570> and

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:58.960 
test tank I'm gonna start hacking and

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.330 
test tank I'm gonna start hacking and
then<00:01:59.110> I'll<00:01:59.439> let<00:01:59.530> you<00:01:59.680> guys<00:01:59.830> see<00:02:00.040> where<00:02:00.189> we're

at from there alright so here's what we
have<00:02:03.820> so<00:02:04.000> far<00:02:04.080> my<00:02:05.080> battery<00:02:05.409> my<00:02:05.470> sawzall<00:02:06.040> died<00:02:06.220> I

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
have so far my battery my sawzall died I

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:08.389 
have so far my battery my sawzall died I
don't<00:02:06.580> have<00:02:06.670> a<00:02:06.700> corded<00:02:07.119> saw<00:02:07.299> saw<00:02:07.540> I<00:02:07.689> wish<00:02:07.960> I<00:02:08.080> did

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
don't have a corded saw saw I wish I did

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.260 
don't have a corded saw saw I wish I did
but<00:02:09.399> we've<00:02:09.879> got<00:02:10.060> to<00:02:10.149> use<00:02:10.239> what<00:02:10.390> you<00:02:10.479> got<00:02:10.659> so

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
but we've got to use what you got so

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.370 
but we've got to use what you got so
here's<00:02:13.270> a<00:02:13.330> side<00:02:13.510> what<00:02:13.660> you<00:02:13.780> do<00:02:13.900> is<00:02:13.959> you<00:02:14.080> mark<00:02:14.290> it

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
here's a side what you do is you mark it

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:15.600 
here's a side what you do is you mark it
out

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
out

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.590 
out
basically<00:02:16.610> you<00:02:16.670> just<00:02:16.700> start<00:02:17.030> hacking<00:02:17.240> at<00:02:17.570> it

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
basically you just start hacking at it

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.170 
basically you just start hacking at it
touching<00:02:18.320> the<00:02:18.350> corners<00:02:18.830> wherever<00:02:19.790> you<00:02:19.910> want

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
touching the corners wherever you want

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.820 
touching the corners wherever you want
which<00:02:20.360> your<00:02:20.540> saws<00:02:20.750> off<00:02:21.880> and<00:02:22.930> just<00:02:23.930> you<00:02:24.800> know

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:24.830 
which your saws off and just you know

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:26.440 
which your saws off and just you know
square<00:02:25.250> off<00:02:25.370> the<00:02:25.460> edges<00:02:25.790> just<00:02:25.820> don't<00:02:26.120> go<00:02:26.210> past

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
square off the edges just don't go past

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:27.550 
square off the edges just don't go past
it<00:02:26.600> because<00:02:26.840> you<00:02:26.930> want<00:02:27.110> this<00:02:27.200> thing<00:02:27.380> to<00:02:27.530> be

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
it because you want this thing to be

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.110 
it because you want this thing to be
balanced<00:02:28.280> equal<00:02:28.870> then<00:02:29.870> what<00:02:30.050> you<00:02:30.170> end<00:02:30.290> up<00:02:30.410> with

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:31.120 
balanced equal then what you end up with

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.490 
balanced equal then what you end up with
is<00:02:32.120> the<00:02:32.300> side<00:02:32.510> that<00:02:32.540> kind<00:02:32.810> of<00:02:32.900> looks<00:02:33.050> like<00:02:33.140> that

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:33.500 
is the side that kind of looks like that

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.720 
is the side that kind of looks like that
okay<00:02:34.220> and<00:02:35.530> then<00:02:36.530> once<00:02:36.800> you<00:02:36.950> got<00:02:37.070> that<00:02:37.310> you<00:02:37.550> take

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:37.730 
okay and then once you got that you take

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:42.760 
okay and then once you got that you take
a<00:02:37.760> grinder<00:02:38.240> to<00:02:38.270> it<00:02:39.550> and<00:02:40.550> you<00:02:40.610> smooth<00:02:40.910> it<00:02:41.030> up<00:02:41.770> so

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:42.770 
a grinder to it and you smooth it up so

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:44.740 
a grinder to it and you smooth it up so
you<00:02:42.860> basically<00:02:43.430> just<00:02:43.550> repeat<00:02:44.360> that<00:02:44.510> process

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
you basically just repeat that process

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.560 
you basically just repeat that process
to<00:02:45.140> all<00:02:45.260> three<00:02:45.560> until<00:02:45.800> you<00:02:45.890> end<00:02:46.010> up<00:02:46.160> with<00:02:46.340> this

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:46.570 
to all three until you end up with this

00:02:46.570 --> 00:02:52.780 
to all three until you end up with this
and<00:02:47.570> in<00:02:48.560> comparison<00:02:49.100> you<00:02:49.490> can<00:02:49.790> see<00:02:51.370> that's<00:02:52.370> the

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
and in comparison you can see that's the

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.930 
and in comparison you can see that's the
the<00:02:53.660> old<00:02:53.840> blade<00:02:54.080> and<00:02:54.320> that's<00:02:54.500> the<00:02:54.710> new<00:02:54.860> guy<00:02:55.520> all

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:55.940 
the old blade and that's the new guy all

00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:57.790 
the old blade and that's the new guy all
right<00:02:56.120> so<00:02:56.750> it's<00:02:56.870> about<00:02:56.930> a<00:02:57.050> third<00:02:57.320> off<00:02:57.560> from

00:02:57.790 --> 00:02:57.800 
right so it's about a third off from

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:03.300 
right so it's about a third off from
what<00:02:57.950> it<00:02:58.070> is<00:03:00.280> ahead<00:03:01.280> of<00:03:01.550> the<00:03:01.610> piece<00:03:01.910> here

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
what it is ahead of the piece here

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.520 
what it is ahead of the piece here
that's<00:03:04.310> about<00:03:04.580> what<00:03:04.850> I<00:03:04.880> took<00:03:04.970> off<00:03:05.360> from<00:03:06.320> the

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
that's about what I took off from the

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:11.170 
that's about what I took off from the
end<00:03:07.060> you<00:03:08.060> know<00:03:08.680> so<00:03:09.680> pretty<00:03:10.610> straightforward

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
end you know so pretty straightforward

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:13.750 
end you know so pretty straightforward
pretty<00:03:11.300> easy<00:03:11.510> to<00:03:11.690> do<00:03:12.370> reason<00:03:13.370> why<00:03:13.460> you<00:03:13.520> would

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
pretty easy to do reason why you would

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.370 
pretty easy to do reason why you would
want<00:03:14.120> to<00:03:14.180> do<00:03:14.330> something<00:03:14.570> like<00:03:14.840> this<00:03:15.020> is<00:03:15.230> that

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380 
want to do something like this is that

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:18.280 
want to do something like this is that
they<00:03:15.500> have<00:03:15.530> test<00:03:16.160> wheels<00:03:16.460> in<00:03:16.790> the<00:03:16.970> the<00:03:17.840> test

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
they have test wheels in the the test

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.060 
they have test wheels in the the test
wheels<00:03:18.530> are<00:03:19.150> there<00:03:20.150> normally<00:03:20.720> for<00:03:21.560> certain

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:22.070 
wheels are there normally for certain

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:25.030 
wheels are there normally for certain
horsepower<00:03:23.140> this<00:03:24.140> will<00:03:24.380> work<00:03:24.560> on<00:03:24.770> a<00:03:24.800> wide

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:25.040 
horsepower this will work on a wide

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:27.460 
horsepower this will work on a wide
range<00:03:25.070> of<00:03:25.490> motors<00:03:25.850> and<00:03:26.780> allow<00:03:27.020> you<00:03:27.080> to<00:03:27.200> put<00:03:27.380> it

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:27.470 
range of motors and allow you to put it

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:29.080 
range of motors and allow you to put it
in<00:03:27.560> a<00:03:27.590> test<00:03:27.830> tank<00:03:28.100> without<00:03:28.250> putting<00:03:28.700> too<00:03:28.850> much

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:29.090 
in a test tank without putting too much

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.770 
in a test tank without putting too much
pressure<00:03:29.330> into<00:03:29.810> the<00:03:30.940> from<00:03:31.940> the<00:03:32.060> thrust<00:03:32.450> of<00:03:32.600> the

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
pressure into the from the thrust of the

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.650 
pressure into the from the thrust of the
propeller<00:03:33.590> and<00:03:33.860> causing<00:03:34.670> the<00:03:34.820> water<00:03:35.390> pump<00:03:35.600> to

propeller and causing the water pump to
cavitate<00:03:36.260> in<00:03:37.000> next<00:03:38.000> scenery<00:03:38.210> sucking<00:03:38.540> air<00:03:38.690> and

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:38.720 
cavitate in next scenery sucking air and

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:40.240 
cavitate in next scenery sucking air and
your<00:03:39.020> running<00:03:39.500> thing<00:03:39.710> dry<00:03:39.920> and<00:03:40.130> your

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 
your running thing dry and your

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:42.820 
your running thing dry and your
overheating<00:03:40.760> your<00:03:40.790> motor<00:03:41.380> and<00:03:42.380> it<00:03:42.680> will<00:03:42.770> help

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:42.830 
overheating your motor and it will help

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:44.140 
overheating your motor and it will help
you<00:03:42.980> put<00:03:43.220> a<00:03:43.250> little<00:03:43.460> bit<00:03:43.610> of<00:03:43.700> load<00:03:43.850> on<00:03:44.000> your

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:44.150 
you put a little bit of load on your

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:47.080 
you put a little bit of load on your
under<00:03:44.780> motor<00:03:44.990> to<00:03:45.230> to<00:03:46.070> find<00:03:46.340> out<00:03:46.520> where<00:03:46.850> your

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:47.090 
under motor to to find out where your

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.510 
under motor to to find out where your
you<00:03:47.900> know<00:03:47.990> your<00:03:48.170> idle<00:03:48.470> setting<00:03:48.680> is<00:03:49.070> and<00:03:49.400> once

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:49.520 
you know your idle setting is and once

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:53.080 
you know your idle setting is and once
you<00:03:49.640> put<00:03:49.850> it<00:03:49.940> in<00:03:50.060> gear<00:03:51.700> it'll<00:03:52.700> help<00:03:52.820> you<00:03:52.940> with

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.090 
you put it in gear it'll help you with

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:54.580 
you put it in gear it'll help you with
those<00:03:53.209> basic<00:03:53.630> settings<00:03:53.959> before<00:03:54.140> you<00:03:54.350> go<00:03:54.500> out

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:54.590 
those basic settings before you go out

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:56.410 
those basic settings before you go out
in<00:03:54.680> the<00:03:54.770> water<00:03:54.920> and<00:03:55.070> really<00:03:55.640> really<00:03:55.970> fine-tune

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:56.420 
in the water and really really fine-tune

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:00.160 
in the water and really really fine-tune
at<00:03:56.540> all<00:03:56.660> you<00:03:56.810> know<00:03:56.930> so<00:03:57.970> this<00:03:58.970> is<00:03:59.150> just<00:03:59.300> a<00:03:59.570> good

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:00.170 
at all you know so this is just a good

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:01.420 
at all you know so this is just a good
way<00:04:00.320> of<00:04:00.350> doing<00:04:00.560> it<00:04:00.770> if<00:04:00.830> you<00:04:00.920> got<00:04:01.040> a<00:04:01.070> spare<00:04:01.400> one

00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:01.430 
way of doing it if you got a spare one

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:03.100 
way of doing it if you got a spare one
that's<00:04:01.790> great<00:04:02.060> if<00:04:02.300> not<00:04:02.600> you<00:04:02.810> know<00:04:02.900> you<00:04:02.990> can

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:03.110 
that's great if not you know you can
