some lateral movement drills so lateral

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:17.740 
some lateral movement drills so lateral
movement<00:00:15.830> is<00:00:15.890> important<00:00:16.250> for<00:00:16.400> defenseman<00:00:16.940> so

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:17.750 
movement is important for defenseman so

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:19.030 
movement is important for defenseman so
that<00:00:17.869> you<00:00:17.990> can<00:00:18.110> take<00:00:18.260> away<00:00:18.410> the<00:00:18.619> forwards

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:19.040 
that you can take away the forwards

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:20.680 
that you can take away the forwards
angle<00:00:19.400> you<00:00:19.700> can<00:00:19.850> pin<00:00:19.970> them<00:00:20.060> off<00:00:20.210> quickly<00:00:20.480> to

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:20.690 
angle you can pin them off quickly to

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:22.300 
angle you can pin them off quickly to
the<00:00:20.779> boards<00:00:21.080> it's<00:00:21.350> important<00:00:21.770> for<00:00:21.890> forwards

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:22.310 
the boards it's important for forwards

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:23.980 
the boards it's important for forwards
so<00:00:22.580> that<00:00:22.700> you<00:00:22.820> can<00:00:22.940> create<00:00:23.119> moves<00:00:23.570> on<00:00:23.900> the

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:23.990 
so that you can create moves on the

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:25.900 
so that you can create moves on the
defenseman<00:00:24.410> so<00:00:25.160> we're<00:00:25.250> going<00:00:25.340> to<00:00:25.460> look<00:00:25.580> at<00:00:25.730> is

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:34.310 
as we move laterally we're going to load

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:36.160 
as we move laterally we're going to load

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:28.840 
every single step the next variation I'm

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.040 
every single step the next variation I'm
going<00:01:28.990> to<00:01:29.050> show<00:01:29.170> you<00:01:29.200> is<00:01:29.530> a<00:01:29.820> Carioca<00:01:30.900> so<00:01:31.900> you're

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:32.050 
going to show you is a Carioca so you're

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:34.500 
going to show you is a Carioca so you're
here<00:01:32.380> you're<00:01:32.500> loading<00:01:33.130> up<00:01:33.250> you're<00:01:34.090> stepping

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:34.510 
here you're loading up you're stepping

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:36.480 
here you're loading up you're stepping
over<00:01:34.600> on<00:01:34.840> this<00:01:34.990> first<00:01:35.260> step<00:01:35.500> here<00:01:35.830> so<00:01:36.460> a

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
over on this first step here so a

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:39.149 
over on this first step here so a
regular<00:01:36.700> cross<00:01:37.150> step<00:01:37.479> as<00:01:37.680> we<00:01:38.680> land<00:01:38.950> our

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:39.159 
regular cross step as we land our

00:01:39.159 --> 00:01:41.550 
regular cross step as we land our
outside<00:01:39.700> foot<00:01:39.940> again<00:01:40.240> we're<00:01:41.170> going<00:01:41.260> to<00:01:41.320> step

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
outside foot again we're going to step

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.400 
outside foot again we're going to step
behind<00:01:41.740> and<00:01:42.660> over<00:01:43.660> so<00:01:43.869> just<00:01:43.900> like<00:01:44.170> you'd<00:01:44.320> be

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:44.410 
behind and over so just like you'd be

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:49.400 
behind and over so just like you'd be
doing<00:01:44.650> it<00:01:44.710> off<00:01:44.860> ice<00:01:46.229> over/under<00:01:47.229> stop

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:49.410 
doing it off ice over/under stop

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:52.469 
doing it off ice over/under stop
over/under<00:01:50.440> stop<00:01:51.160> so<00:01:51.910> once<00:01:52.090> you<00:01:52.210> get<00:01:52.300> some

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:52.479 
over/under stop so once you get some

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:54.749 
over/under stop so once you get some
speed<00:01:52.810> going<00:01:53.160> here's<00:01:54.160> what<00:01:54.310> it<00:01:54.400> looks<00:01:54.610> like

00:01:54.749 --> 00:01:54.759 
speed going here's what it looks like

00:01:54.759 --> 00:02:00.210 
speed going here's what it looks like
again<00:01:55.979> stay<00:01:56.979> low<00:01:58.380> keep<00:01:59.380> your<00:01:59.410> hips<00:01:59.680> facing<00:01:59.890> up

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:00.220 
again stay low keep your hips facing up

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:03.120 
again stay low keep your hips facing up
ice<00:02:00.430> keep<00:02:00.970> them<00:02:01.090> squared<00:02:01.830> last<00:02:02.830> one<00:02:03.009> we're

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
ice keep them squared last one we're

in that same stance the only difference

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.500 
in that same stance the only difference
is<00:02:23.769> our<00:02:23.890> mindset<00:02:24.310> is<00:02:24.430> going<00:02:24.580> to<00:02:24.640> be<00:02:24.790> we<00:02:25.300> don't

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510

to push to clear that blue come back
load<00:02:32.290> up<00:02:33.690> exaggerate<00:02:34.690> that<00:02:34.870> push<00:02:35.170> that<00:02:35.200> under

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
load up exaggerate that push that under

push on the outside edge to clear the
blue<00:02:37.980> so<00:02:38.980> this<00:02:39.160> one<00:02:39.370> we<00:02:39.459> can<00:02:39.579> go<00:02:39.959> will

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
that outside edge your rocking from that

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:57.649 
that outside edge your rocking from that
heel<00:02:54.480> of<00:02:54.689> the<00:02:55.500> outside<00:02:55.829> edge<00:02:56.010> to<00:02:56.340> the<00:02:56.430> toe<00:02:56.659> till

heel of the outside edge to the toe till

00:02:57.659 --> 00:03:00.050 
heel of the outside edge to the toe till
finish<00:02:57.959> is<00:02:58.079> down<00:02:58.260> into<00:02:58.530> the<00:02:58.590> ice<00:02:58.799> as<00:02:59.099> you<00:02:59.819> step

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:00.060 
finish is down into the ice as you step

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:05.059 
finish is down into the ice as you step
over<00:03:00.269> so<00:03:00.750> here<00:03:01.129> heel-toe<00:03:02.129> heel-toe<00:03:04.069> pushing

00:03:05.059 --> 00:03:05.069 
over so here heel-toe heel-toe pushing

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:07.490 
over so here heel-toe heel-toe pushing
with<00:03:05.220> both<00:03:05.430> legs<00:03:05.760> so<00:03:06.420> that<00:03:06.480> we<00:03:06.750> that<00:03:07.019> we<00:03:07.049> clear
