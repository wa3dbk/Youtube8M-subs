00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:05.490
 well on this occasion we are going to perform the 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.460
 checking a magneto sensor 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:11.610
 weathered of an abs brake system is 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:14.790
 which is located on the wheel so 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:17.040
 which will we need the sensor that 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.410
 in this case, see who is 

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:21.800
 incorporated directly into the speaker 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:25.070
 the wheel 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.869
 and we are going to require a resistance in 

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:30.380
 this case we have selected a 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:34.040
 coal resistance of 220 euros let's go 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:35.899
 to need a variable source that in 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:38.210
 case of not having the variable source 

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:40.970
 we can also make use of a battery 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.940
 of a vehicle we need a 

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:45.699
 oscilloscope 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:48.160
 and we can also use two 

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:51.510
 multimeters in this case this one that's going 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:54.159
 to facilitate the measurement the verification 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.750
 visualize the voltage variation and 

00:00:54.159 --> 00:00:57.730
 this other one that will serve us for 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.829
 visualize also the variation but 

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:02.739
 the stream of campers 

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:05.470
 It is important to mention that the 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:07.990
 Weathered movement sensor has 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:10.450
 polarity therefore you have to respect 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.549
 at the time of making the connection the 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:15.520
 positive and the negative of the sensor 

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:19.120
 we have placed in this case a connection 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:22.840
 In series the resistance is in series 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:24.310
 and from there we have also connected the 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.750
 multimeters and the own threads for 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:29.380
 perform the different checks 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:31.810
 well below to be able to see the 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:35.230
 signal that this sensor produces we are going to 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:38.830
 turn the horn so that the field 

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:40.930
 affect the sensor and how they can 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:47.080
 you observe here in the gyroscopes 

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:49.300
 a square signal begins to be generated 

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:52.450
 This sensor has the peculiarity of 

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:55.000
 which can detect movement signal 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:02:00.750
 from zero kilometers per hour and in addition 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:04.410
 can also capture the reverse turn 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:06.090
 in reverse that we can observe here in 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:09.360
 the multimeters 

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:12.030
 the variation in the assembly 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:15.110
 this tells us that the sensor is in 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:18.660
 optimal conditions in addition to the signal and 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:21.120
 to check the variant of the 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:24.810
 intensity of the current that goes from 

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:27.330
 14 milliamps up to 7,000 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.310
 amps then the movement that 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:32.730
 performs as we can observe is very 

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:35.400
 slight this to be able to achieve 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:38.790
 variation intervals in the sensor 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:42.590
 observe here the reading that goes from the 14 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.590
 at 7 mm 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.640
 very well this would be all for now
