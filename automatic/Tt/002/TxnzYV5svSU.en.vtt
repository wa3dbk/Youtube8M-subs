leadership<00:00:55.510> and<00:00:55.840> I<00:00:55.900> think<00:00:56.170> the<00:00:56.350> terrain<00:00:56.650> is<00:00:56.830> of

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:56.980 
leadership and I think the terrain is of

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.550 
leadership and I think the terrain is of
God<00:00:57.190> that<00:00:57.430> because<00:00:58.270> of<00:00:58.450> his<00:00:58.630> environment<00:00:59.079> he's

00:00:59.550 --> 00:00:59.560 
God that because of his environment he's

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.920 
God that because of his environment he's
forced<00:00:59.980> to<00:01:00.040> live<00:01:00.489> a<00:01:00.520> negative<00:01:01.030> life<00:01:01.239> but

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:01.930 
forced to live a negative life but

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:04.620 
forced to live a negative life but
there's<00:01:02.110> a<00:01:02.230> positive<00:01:03.119> undertone<00:01:04.119> about<00:01:04.449> him

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:04.630
