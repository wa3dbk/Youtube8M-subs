00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.410 
either of these Portsmouth maybe but
probably<00:01:46.860> not<00:01:46.979> Aston<00:01:47.430> Villa<00:01:47.610> as<00:01:48.000> he's<00:01:48.210> already

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
probably not Aston Villa as he's already

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.120 
probably not Aston Villa as he's already
come<00:01:48.689> out<00:01:48.840> to<00:01:48.990> say<00:01:49.170> that<00:01:49.380> he<00:01:49.530> would<00:01:49.649> rather<00:01:49.799> not

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:50.130 
come out to say that he would rather not

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.770 
come out to say that he would rather not
go<00:01:50.340> there<00:01:50.579> and<00:01:50.880> he<00:01:51.030> doesn't<00:01:51.270> want<00:01:51.390> to<00:01:51.450> play<00:01:51.540> for

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
go there and he doesn't want to play for

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:55.399 
go there and he doesn't want to play for
that<00:01:51.840> team<00:01:52.579> personally<00:01:53.579> I<00:01:53.939> think<00:01:54.259> it<00:01:55.259> would<00:01:55.380> be

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
that team personally I think it would be

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.050 
that team personally I think it would be
ashamed<00:01:55.740> he<00:01:56.100> can<00:01:56.250> go

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
ashamed he can go

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.590 
ashamed he can go

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
he had his hi he's had his lows and he

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.149 
he had his hi he's had his lows and he
thinks<00:02:00.990> he<00:02:01.110> found<00:02:01.470> his<00:02:01.680> fighting<00:02:01.920> spirit

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
thinks he found his fighting spirit

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.700 
thinks he found his fighting spirit

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
recently he started the season a lot

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.649 
recently he started the season a lot
more<00:02:04.860> positively<00:02:05.340> than<00:02:05.520> I<00:02:06.000> think<00:02:06.299> we've<00:02:06.450> seen

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:06.659 
more positively than I think we've seen

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.380 
more positively than I think we've seen
him<00:02:06.810> start<00:02:07.049> before<00:02:07.280> whether<00:02:08.280> that<00:02:08.550> is<00:02:08.849> because

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
him start before whether that is because

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:11.630 
him start before whether that is because
of<00:02:09.420> the<00:02:09.539> introduction<00:02:09.929> of<00:02:10.440> his<00:02:11.039> close<00:02:11.340> friend
