00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.119 

and<00:00:00.989> the<00:00:01.079> next<00:00:01.350> technique<00:00:01.620> we're<00:00:01.770> going<00:00:01.949> to<00:00:02.010> go

00:00:02.119 --> 00:00:02.129 
and the next technique we're going to go

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:05.210 
and the next technique we're going to go
over<00:00:02.429> is<00:00:02.669> jumping<00:00:03.270> notes<00:00:03.480> and<00:00:03.840> this<00:00:04.680> technique

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220 
over is jumping notes and this technique

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.369 
over is jumping notes and this technique
allows<00:00:05.670> you<00:00:05.879> a<00:00:06.029> lot<00:00:06.060> more<00:00:06.420> note<00:00:06.660> combinations

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
allows you a lot more note combinations

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:09.950 
allows you a lot more note combinations
when<00:00:07.680> you're<00:00:07.859> creating<00:00:08.099> melodies<00:00:08.510> up<00:00:09.510> to<00:00:09.780> now

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
when you're creating melodies up to now

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.990 
when you're creating melodies up to now
we've<00:00:10.290> just<00:00:10.320> been<00:00:10.710> walking<00:00:11.000> consecutive

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
we've just been walking consecutive

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.390 
we've just been walking consecutive
notes<00:00:12.210> one<00:00:12.599> note<00:00:12.780> after<00:00:12.960> the<00:00:13.259> other<00:00:13.410> and<00:00:13.769> so

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:14.400 
notes one note after the other and so

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.950 
notes one note after the other and so
this<00:00:14.580> will<00:00:14.759> allow<00:00:15.000> for<00:00:15.030> a<00:00:15.299> whole<00:00:15.509> new<00:00:15.690> set<00:00:15.929> of

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
this will allow for a whole new set of

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.880 
this will allow for a whole new set of
notes<00:00:16.230> to<00:00:16.440> be<00:00:16.470> combined<00:00:17.340> so<00:00:18.439> the<00:00:19.439> basic<00:00:19.859> rule

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
notes to be combined so the basic rule

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.580 
notes to be combined so the basic rule
here<00:00:20.670> is<00:00:20.850> that<00:00:21.150> any<00:00:21.480> hole<00:00:21.869> that<00:00:22.050> you<00:00:22.170> open

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
here is that any hole that you open

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.890 
here is that any hole that you open
you'll<00:00:23.220> open<00:00:23.490> everything<00:00:23.730> below<00:00:24.180> it<00:00:24.210> along

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
you'll open everything below it along

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.660 
you'll open everything below it along
with<00:00:25.140> it<00:00:25.380> and<00:00:25.590> you'll<00:00:25.769> open<00:00:25.920> and<00:00:26.279> you'll<00:00:26.460> keep

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
with it and you'll open and you'll keep

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.109 
with it and you'll open and you'll keep
everything<00:00:27.090> above<00:00:27.330> it<00:00:27.480> closed<00:00:28.160> and<00:00:29.160> with<00:00:29.910> that

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
everything above it closed and with that

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.849 
everything above it closed and with that
you've<00:00:30.359> actually<00:00:30.510> been<00:00:30.810> doing<00:00:30.960> that<00:00:31.230> so<00:00:31.410> far

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:31.859 
you've actually been doing that so far

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.220 
you've actually been doing that so far
if<00:00:31.920> you<00:00:32.369> close<00:00:32.700> all<00:00:32.910> the<00:00:33.030> holes<00:00:33.239> and<00:00:33.570> you<00:00:33.989> walk

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230 
if you close all the holes and you walk

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:36.830 
if you close all the holes and you walk
one<00:00:34.559> note<00:00:34.800> after<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.730> other<00:00:36.000> consecutive

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
one note after the other consecutive

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.020 
one note after the other consecutive
notes<00:00:37.020> up<00:00:37.290> to<00:00:37.469> that<00:00:37.620> third<00:00:37.920> note<00:00:38.219> if<00:00:38.489> you

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
notes up to that third note if you

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.299 
notes up to that third note if you
notice<00:00:39.360> everything<00:00:39.719> below<00:00:40.440> it<00:00:40.469> is<00:00:40.829> open

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
notice everything below it is open

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.940 
notice everything below it is open
everything<00:00:42.120> above<00:00:42.420> it<00:00:42.540> is<00:00:42.719> closed<00:00:43.140> and<00:00:43.469> that's

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
everything above it is closed and that's

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:46.220 
everything above it is closed and that's
the<00:00:44.129> rule<00:00:44.309> that<00:00:44.340> I'm<00:00:44.550> talking<00:00:44.760> about<00:00:44.969> so<00:00:45.750> if

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
the rule that I'm talking about so if

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.900 
the rule that I'm talking about so if
I'm<00:00:46.379> on<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:46.710> lowest<00:00:47.070> note<00:00:47.309> and<00:00:47.579> I<00:00:47.640> want<00:00:47.820> to

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
I'm on the lowest note and I want to

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.060 
I'm on the lowest note and I want to
jump<00:00:48.120> right<00:00:48.180> up<00:00:48.360> to<00:00:48.600> that<00:00:48.719> third<00:00:48.989> note<00:00:49.200> I<00:00:49.500> just

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
jump right up to that third note I just

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.010 
jump right up to that third note I just
open<00:00:50.430> all<00:00:50.579> three<00:00:51.059> of<00:00:51.149> those<00:00:51.239> bottom<00:00:51.660> holes<00:00:51.840> at

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
open all three of those bottom holes at

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.959 
open all three of those bottom holes at
once<00:00:52.230> and<00:00:52.620> that<00:00:53.070> jumps<00:00:53.430> you<00:00:53.520> right<00:00:53.699> up<00:00:53.820> to<00:00:53.850> that

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
once and that jumps you right up to that

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.529 
once and that jumps you right up to that
third<00:00:54.329> note<00:00:54.600> and<00:00:55.520> that<00:00:56.520> the<00:00:56.789> same<00:00:57.000> rule<00:00:57.270> also

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
third note and that the same rule also

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:00.080 
third note and that the same rule also
applies<00:00:57.989> to<00:00:58.020> jumping<00:00:58.680> down<00:00:58.829> notes<00:00:59.129> if<00:00:59.430> I'm<00:00:59.910> on

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
applies to jumping down notes if I'm on

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:02.689 
applies to jumping down notes if I'm on
this<00:01:00.300> third<00:01:00.539> hole<00:01:00.809> up<00:01:01.050> this<00:01:01.559> third<00:01:01.800> note<00:01:02.070> and<00:01:02.370> I

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
this third hole up this third note and I

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.490 
this third hole up this third note and I
want<00:01:02.879> to<00:01:02.940> jump<00:01:03.180> down<00:01:03.239> to<00:01:03.750> the<00:01:03.840> bottom<00:01:03.870> note<00:01:04.320> I

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
want to jump down to the bottom note I

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.010 
want to jump down to the bottom note I
just<00:01:04.799> closed<00:01:04.979> all<00:01:05.189> the<00:01:05.220> holes<00:01:05.489> at<00:01:05.670> once<00:01:05.880> or<00:01:06.240> if

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
just closed all the holes at once or if

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.870 
just closed all the holes at once or if
I'm<00:01:07.170> on<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.500> top<00:01:07.710> note<00:01:08.010> and<00:01:08.280> I<00:01:08.430> want<00:01:08.610> to<00:01:08.700> jump

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
I'm on the top note and I want to jump

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.149 
I'm on the top note and I want to jump
down<00:01:09.090> a<00:01:09.150> couple<00:01:09.570> notes<00:01:09.869> I<00:01:10.140> just<00:01:10.650> closed<00:01:10.890> both

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
down a couple notes I just closed both

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.920 
down a couple notes I just closed both
those<00:01:11.430> holes<00:01:11.640> at<00:01:11.790> once<00:01:11.970> everything<00:01:12.360> above<00:01:12.780> it

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
those holes at once everything above it

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.719 
those holes at once everything above it
is<00:01:13.020> closed<00:01:13.320> everything<00:01:13.650> below<00:01:14.100> it<00:01:14.130> is<00:01:14.369> open

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:14.729 
is closed everything below it is open

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.330 
is closed everything below it is open
and<00:01:14.939> so<00:01:15.240> with<00:01:15.689> this<00:01:15.869> technique<00:01:16.290> you<00:01:16.890> can<00:01:17.040> start

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
and so with this technique you can start

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:18.830 
and so with this technique you can start
putting<00:01:17.790> different<00:01:18.060> notes<00:01:18.390> how<00:01:18.600> many

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
putting different notes how many

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:20.300 
putting different notes how many
different<00:01:19.170> notes<00:01:19.530> together<00:01:19.770> that<00:01:20.189> you

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
different notes together that you

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.890 
different notes together that you
wouldn't<00:01:20.610> be<00:01:20.700> able<00:01:20.729> to<00:01:20.909> do<00:01:21.090> if<00:01:21.390> you're<00:01:21.630> just

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
wouldn't be able to do if you're just

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.230 
wouldn't be able to do if you're just
doing<00:01:22.320> consecutive<00:01:23.100> notes<00:01:23.280> and<00:01:23.580> what<00:01:24.060> that

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:24.240 
doing consecutive notes and what that

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:33.360 
doing consecutive notes and what that
sounds<00:01:24.689> like<00:01:24.720> is<00:01:25.049> something<00:01:25.259> like<00:01:25.500> this

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:33.370 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:46.639 

Oh

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:46.649 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.800 

some<00:01:47.649> just<00:01:47.829> jumping<00:01:48.280> notes<00:01:48.520> to<00:01:48.850> add<00:01:49.000> some<00:01:49.329> new

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810 
some just jumping notes to add some new

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:52.080 
some just jumping notes to add some new
variations<00:01:50.500> my<00:01:50.680> melodies<00:01:51.159> in<00:01:51.430> the<00:01:51.880> note

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.090 
variations my melodies in the note

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.780 
variations my melodies in the note
combinations<00:01:52.780> that<00:01:52.990> I'm<00:01:53.110> creating<00:01:53.580> this<00:01:54.580> is<00:01:54.759> a

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:54.790 
combinations that I'm creating this is a

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:57.600 
combinations that I'm creating this is a
really<00:01:55.119> great<00:01:55.330> technique
