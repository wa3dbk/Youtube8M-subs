00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:10.180
 a special tool we also in 

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:12.670
 the toolbox is available 

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:15.320
 this one here namely that universal 

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:19.009
 manipulator tool the universal 

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:20.570
 manipulator tool and if i am here 

00:00:19.009 --> 00:00:22.910
 my cylinder once i 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:25.820
 prepared in the scene have anne wehle 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:29.000
 and in parallel, a left click on 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:31.910
 I will make this icon here 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.030
 also the possibility to go and 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:38.510
 object to move my to rotate and 

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:41.480
 to scale only i have all of these 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:43.820
 functions here now in one namely 

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.980
 a universal manipulation 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:47.030
 Tool virtually under a roof 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.490
 united 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.780
 that means I could go too and 

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:53.150
 does not always have to be between these 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:56.000
 switch tools but I could 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:59.030
 once the universal manipulations 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.280
 activate tool and then have it here 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:04.159
 get a touch of me 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:07.399
 Alone with this single one 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:09.679
 handle all these three functions too 

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:12.649
 apply to my object 

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:15.079
 Let's start with what's on us 

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:18.319
 Namely least unknown comes namely 

00:01:15.079 --> 00:01:21.560
 here this ax three-legged and indeed 

00:01:18.319 --> 00:01:24.109
 Click here on the arrowhead and me 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:27.109
 move my object in the scene 

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:29.509
 and the beautiful is here if I am 

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:31.700
 here in the middle look then stands 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:34.159
 here now a 0,0 0 0 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.619
 and as soon as I put the object in here 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:39.079
 This value changes 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:41.829
 from 0 also exactly with and indeed around 

00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:44.329
 the value around which I have my object here 

00:01:41.829 --> 00:01:47.600
 move back again 

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:49.399
 made and scale when we get here from 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.770
 I can start back now 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:54.170
 here my object with this universal 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.929
 tool in which i here one of these 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:59.119
 bluish highlights 

00:01:56.929 --> 00:02:03.709
 select with the left mouse button on it 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:06.020
 clique arrests and the whole here in 

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:09.170
 to draw a direction 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:11.990
 So that's how it is when I'm here this 

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:14.060
 corner I choose only on this axis 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:16.430
 can move me if i am now in 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.290
 another axis wants to move me 

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:20.930
 For example , I have to go down here 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:23.180
 select this point and then come 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.340
 I just also on this axis here 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.500
 where I might be now in this 

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.989
 moment would like to scale much better here 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.209
 or we have to do that too 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:35.180
 Undo and last option 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:38.030
 here at this manipulator we have 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:42.640
 still here these circle elements these 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:44.710
 circle parts with the arrowheads on it 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:47.319
 and there it is just like that when I am 

00:02:44.710 --> 00:02:51.870
 once click on the red one, for example 

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:55.060
 then i can rotate this object and 

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:59.320
 Although there is a little difference too 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:02.709
 the normal rotation tool if I have 

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:06.280
 Go over here then that is 

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:08.920
 like this, I'll switch this one here 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:12.060
 normal rotating tool on when I am 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:15.450
 it does not rotate here then it rotates 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:18.280
 as he did this here 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:21.220
 He rotates in principle so that if I 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:23.380
 up here he select them this element 

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:27.130
 here on the opposite side 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:32.590
 this corner takes and just here 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:35.560
 around this corner quasi the rotation spend 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:38.200
 speaking yes but also can rotate with 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:41.940
 a slightly different result 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.940
 just like here 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:49.660
 that means but we keep firm 

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:52.239
 we have this university leaves tool 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:55.000
 the possibility of just a tool 

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:58.570
 What are these three functions? 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:02.910
 basically connecting with each other and with only 

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:02.910
 makes it possible for a person to be touched
