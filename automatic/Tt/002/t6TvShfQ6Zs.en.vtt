any<00:02:10.420> worse<00:02:10.720> because<00:02:11.260> of<00:02:11.470> considering<00:02:12.010> all<00:02:12.130> the

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
any worse because of considering all the

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.320 
any worse because of considering all the
things<00:02:12.459> that's<00:02:12.610> its<00:02:13.570> fell<00:02:13.870> on<00:02:14.019> concrete<00:02:14.530> and

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
things that's its fell on concrete and

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:19.920 
things that's its fell on concrete and
it's<00:02:16.330> been<00:02:16.480> hit<00:02:16.630> against<00:02:16.870> walls<00:02:18.540> but<00:02:19.540> they've

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:19.930 
it's been hit against walls but they've

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:21.390
