00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.330
 many girls I find you for 

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:13.780
 a casual outfit of the day of the 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:15.519
 Sunday 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:17.289
 well it's been a long time since we have not 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:20.109
 made of fake 6 and the opportunity even though my 

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:22.089
 held absolutely nothing exceptional 

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:24.970
 I still wanted to make a 

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:27.399
 so at the level of makeup in blush 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:31.149
 I put the physicist in formula like 

00:00:27.399 --> 00:00:32.890
 those who is the natural so that's it 

00:00:31.149 --> 00:00:34.239
 I put that on my cheeks not so choice 

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:36.629
 you will see very very well since I have 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:39.940
 I want it lightly but I put it 

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:42.120
 at the level of make up make you a little 

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.120
 zoom 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:49.870
 so I realized this makeup with my 

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:53.769
 nude palette from physicist formula 

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:55.749
 so so that's so I used this 

00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:58.179
 color if still a term this color 

00:00:55.749 --> 00:01:00.249
 if all over the eyelid mobile and that in 

00:00:58.179 --> 00:01:02.289
 outer corner so open it gives that 

00:01:00.249 --> 00:01:03.429
 it is a very good range the 

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:06.430
 frankly nude of what we are looking for 

00:01:03.429 --> 00:01:08.260
 a nice thing that's fine I did 

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:09.190
 my usual talent that you know 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:13.420
 and on the lips 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:17.500
 I put the freddy gentlemen at home 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:20.770
 guillou gentlemen and from above I put 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:24.610
 my mac gloss who hold it a 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:31.750
 limited collection that's it and this is the 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:32.950
 summer sweet count so here's for the 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.560
 simply makeup 

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.210
 we then go to the hairdressing 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.410
 I did not do anything just tied mameche 

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.540
 as usual and I put some oil 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:43.180
 on my hair but otherwise I have nothing 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:47.020
 done at the jewelery level I put my 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:49.210
 little bow- shaped loops that 

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:52.240
 bought it in Bordeaux at the shop I 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.560
 do not know what it is at the level of 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.440
 collar this employee who comes from 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.990

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.700

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:01.240
 I love this one a lot I find it 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:06.369
 really 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:08.050
 but really very nice at the level of 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:10.149
 luggage carries my phalanx ring which 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:11.830
 did not know h &amp; m with a knot and that's a 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:13.630
 ring that just leaked at least that 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:16.989

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:18.670

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:21.190
