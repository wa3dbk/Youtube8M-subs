00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.799
 ramón kilos hagas juan carlos oblitas 

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:06.750
 victories of the sporting crystal 2 to 0 without 

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:08.400
 crystal everything took his patience to 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.929
 slide and add three points not because 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.400
 the first time suddenly the first 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.559
 ten fifteen minutes were important 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.210
 crystal that created many situations of 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:17.220
 goal by the side attacking by the sea 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.439
 on the side of Rioja that had 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.420
 recostado the band but today it appeared 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.850
 morals to try on an opportunity 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.260
 to take or avoid some shots that brings 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.289
 some danger to the arc of scienceno 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.720
 and then I think it 's hell 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.640
 level or a little the party could remove 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:34.530
 at the end another but and the second time 

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.719
 already crystal found something quick this 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.670
 chiquito da silva not for good the 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.540
 first in a position before 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:41.540
 end up closing 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:46.680
 stuck to the second post and weigh 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:49.680
 that we can reach 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.480
 normally the archer goes the stick and so 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:52.800
 comes the first goal pp says that there 

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.989
 opened the game and has crystal with 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.059
 patience taking more care of the position of 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.580
 pellet when crystals made change 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:01.410
 already crystals was a clear dominator to 

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:03.390
 Although it has two opportunities 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.600
 people from the team is from Cusco 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:10.320
 once Chinese ximénez another dictate if not 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:13.020
 I'm wrong that maybe suddenly the 2 a 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.550
 1 I did a little more percussion to 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.350
 people positions with officers 

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:17.820
 for my species that ending well you 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.930
 of some players let me think about 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.210
 Thursday's match against alliance 

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.630
 file and ends adding three points and 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.399
 ends pointer no 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.619
 and being well wins by what's done in the 

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:30.770
 second time I do not know if it was the exit 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:32.470
 of acasiete that forces again to a 

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.420
 line of 4 to 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:37.909
 a mario a 

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.890
 to the superiority of crystal the two 

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:42.890
 things were bought glass was much more 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:45.170
 that scienceno in the second time and the 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.899
 goal allowed him the first goal 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:51.680
 allowed for a long time to open and there 

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:56.020
 made things easier for her, let's see the 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:56.020
 numbers of this commitment 

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.830
 ten direct auctions for sporting 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:02.290
 crystal 5 for scienceno in deviant 8 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:04.479
 and 4 on fouls 16 and 11 on cards 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:05.800
 yellows 2 and 3 there were no red 7 shots of 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:08.229
 corner for sporting crystal none 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:10.539
 for science no offside 4 equal 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:13.630
 He had it more sporting glass than 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:15.760
 ends up winning the match 2 to 0 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:18.870
 victory that puts him at the head of the 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.870
 Classification of the closing tournament
