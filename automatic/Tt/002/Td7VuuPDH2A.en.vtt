00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
crazy so you have to go do some marker

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:21.410 
crazy so you have to go do some marker
destroying<00:02:20.010> and<00:02:20.340> after<00:02:20.730> that<00:02:20.819> there<00:02:21.090> is<00:02:21.240> the

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420 
destroying and after that there is the

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:22.940 
destroying and after that there is the
storage<00:02:21.720> cache<00:02:21.990> which<00:02:22.230> is<00:02:22.350> going<00:02:22.500> to<00:02:22.590> contain

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
storage cache which is going to contain

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:25.790 
storage cache which is going to contain
the<00:02:23.459> remainder<00:02:24.060> of<00:02:24.420> all<00:02:24.900> of<00:02:25.290> the<00:02:25.410> weapons

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:25.800 
the remainder of all of the weapons

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:27.530 
the remainder of all of the weapons
which<00:02:26.310> is<00:02:26.340> a<00:02:26.520> good<00:02:26.910> little<00:02:27.120> thing<00:02:27.360> here

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
which is a good little thing here

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.330 
which is a good little thing here
because<00:02:27.630> you<00:02:27.840> get<00:02:27.959> the<00:02:28.080> last<00:02:28.230> weapon<00:02:28.590> part<00:02:28.830> the

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
because you get the last weapon part the

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.280 
because you get the last weapon part the
last<00:02:29.580> circuit<00:02:30.000> obviously<00:02:30.870> you<00:02:30.930> might<00:02:31.050> get<00:02:31.200> at

last circuit obviously you might get at

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:32.510 
last circuit obviously you might get at
a<00:02:31.319> different<00:02:31.590> spot<00:02:31.740> but<00:02:31.980> this<00:02:32.130> is<00:02:32.250> the<00:02:32.340> last

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520
