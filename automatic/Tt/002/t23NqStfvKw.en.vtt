yeah meets average but base is really
really<00:04:43.680> good<00:04:44.090> base<00:04:45.090> is<00:04:45.449> pretty<00:04:46.289> punchy<00:04:46.979> pretty

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:47.750 
really good base is pretty punchy pretty

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:50.869 
really good base is pretty punchy pretty
like<00:04:48.750> if<00:04:49.020> you<00:04:49.199> want<00:04:49.500> them<00:04:49.740> to<00:04:49.949> me<00:04:50.069> it's<00:04:50.430> not

00:04:50.869 --> 00:04:50.879 
like if you want them to me it's not

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:53.420 
like if you want them to me it's not
that<00:04:51.120> basic<00:04:51.629> you<00:04:51.840> can<00:04:52.050> set<00:04:52.349> them<00:04:52.500> not<00:04:53.129> to<00:04:53.310> be

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:53.430 
that basic you can set them not to be

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:55.550 
that basic you can set them not to be
that<00:04:53.610> busy<00:04:53.849> they<00:04:54.629> are<00:04:54.659> quite<00:04:55.050> sensitive<00:04:55.289> to

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:55.560 
that busy they are quite sensitive to

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:58.010 
that busy they are quite sensitive to
equalizing<00:04:56.310> even<00:04:56.879> the<00:04:57.000> iPod<00:04:57.330> equalizer<00:04:57.750> what

00:04:58.010 --> 00:04:58.020 
equalizing even the iPod equalizer what

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:59.179 
equalizing even the iPod equalizer what
works<00:04:58.469> with<00:04:58.650> these<00:04:58.800> they<00:04:59.039> are<00:04:59.069> really

00:04:59.179 --> 00:04:59.189 
works with these they are really

00:04:59.189 --> 00:05:00.980 
works with these they are really
sensitive<00:04:59.939> to<00:05:00.060> equalizing<00:05:00.659> and<00:05:00.780> that's<00:05:00.900> a

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:00.990 
sensitive to equalizing and that's a

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:03.140 
sensitive to equalizing and that's a
good<00:05:01.169> thing<00:05:01.439> because<00:05:02.099> you<00:05:02.219> can<00:05:02.430> set<00:05:02.669> the<00:05:02.819> music

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:03.150

more bass that I'm used to listen to now

00:05:23.909 --> 00:05:26.420 
more bass that I'm used to listen to now
when<00:05:24.090> I<00:05:24.120> live<00:05:24.389> in<00:05:24.479> to<00:05:24.599> my<00:05:24.719> other<00:05:24.900> headphones<00:05:25.430> I

think well they don't have they have a

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:31.399 
think well they don't have they have a
very<00:05:29.729> low<00:05:30.120> amount<00:05:30.509> of<00:05:30.599> bass<00:05:30.870> because<00:05:31.379> I

00:05:31.399 --> 00:05:31.409 
very low amount of bass because I

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:33.200 
very low amount of bass because I

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:15.120 
amazing oh the only problem that I've

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:16.760 
amazing oh the only problem that I've

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:16.770 
had is that they sometimes tingle well

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:19.550 
had is that they sometimes tingle well
way<00:06:17.069> too<00:06:17.129> much<00:06:17.479> when<00:06:18.479> they<00:06:18.629> stay<00:06:19.050> in<00:06:19.169> a<00:06:19.229> couple

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:19.560 
way too much when they stay in a couple

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:21.950 
way too much when they stay in a couple
of<00:06:19.650> it<00:06:19.800> for<00:06:20.129> a<00:06:20.159> couple<00:06:20.219> of<00:06:20.520> hours<00:06:20.849> in<00:06:21.330> a<00:06:21.509> tingly

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:21.960 
of it for a couple of hours in a tingly

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:25.279 
of it for a couple of hours in a tingly
position<00:06:22.440> and<00:06:23.210> I<00:06:24.210> think<00:06:24.389> that's<00:06:24.810> all<00:06:24.930> I<00:06:24.960> can't

00:06:25.279 --> 00:06:25.289

position and I think that's all I can't
be<00:06:25.349> said<00:06:25.770> oh<00:06:26.039> and<00:06:26.940> yes<00:06:27.330> there's<00:06:27.569> another

00:06:27.649 --> 00:06:27.659

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:30.120 
problem the cable the cable and in here

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:32.899 
problem the cable the cable and in here
is<00:06:30.240> not<00:06:30.629> very<00:06:30.690> good<00:06:31.050> because<00:06:31.409> yes<00:06:32.279> it<00:06:32.490> tangles

00:06:32.899 --> 00:06:32.909
