00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.050 
it has a lot of like math involved in it

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:01.230 
it has a lot of like math involved in it
as<00:01:59.230> well<00:01:59.290> because<00:02:00.250> there's<00:02:00.670> another<00:02:00.910> trick

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:01.240 
as well because there's another trick

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.290 
as well because there's another trick
called<00:02:01.660> 360<00:02:02.470> shuvit<00:02:02.770> which<00:02:03.190> is<00:02:03.370> with<00:02:03.640> the

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:04.300 
called 360 shuvit which is with the

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.290 
called 360 shuvit which is with the
board<00:02:04.570> spinning<00:02:05.050> and<00:02:05.230> 360<00:02:06.130> degree<00:02:06.910> rotation

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:07.300 
board spinning and 360 degree rotation

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.139 
board spinning and 360 degree rotation
and<00:02:08.040> the<00:02:09.040> kickflip<00:02:09.429> which<00:02:09.700> I<00:02:09.820> showed<00:02:10.000> you

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:10.149 
and the kickflip which I showed you

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:14.100 
and the kickflip which I showed you
before<00:02:10.530> moving<00:02:11.530> in<00:02:11.770> another<00:02:12.070> 360<00:02:12.760> 360<00:02:13.750> degree

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:14.110 
before moving in another 360 360 degree

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.170 
before moving in another 360 360 degree
rotation<00:02:14.440> so<00:02:15.280> whenever<00:02:15.460> you<00:02:15.610> add<00:02:15.760> these<00:02:16.000> two

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
rotation so whenever you add these two

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:31.610 
rotation so whenever you add these two
tricks<00:02:16.420> together<00:02:16.750> it<00:02:17.590> becomes<00:02:18.330> trifle
