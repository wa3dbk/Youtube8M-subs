m-series<00:00:30.860> Bobcat<00:00:31.860> loaders<00:00:32.250> are<00:00:32.460> very<00:00:32.820> common

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
m-series Bobcat loaders are very common

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.680 
m-series Bobcat loaders are very common
from<00:00:33.480> one<00:00:33.629> to<00:00:33.809> another<00:00:33.839> we've<00:00:35.600> increased<00:00:36.600> the

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
from one to another we've increased the

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.389 
from one to another we've increased the
operator<00:00:37.109> comfort<00:00:37.589> which<00:00:37.739> is<00:00:37.890> a<00:00:37.920> big<00:00:38.160> thing

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
operator comfort which is a big thing

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.009 
operator comfort which is a big thing
for<00:00:38.429> our<00:00:38.699> machines<00:00:39.089> we've<00:00:39.359> tried<00:00:39.600> to<00:00:39.719> make<00:00:39.870> the

00:00:40.009 --> 00:00:40.019 
for our machines we've tried to make the

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:42.860 
for our machines we've tried to make the
serviceability<00:00:40.760> easier<00:00:41.760> and<00:00:41.940> better<00:00:42.059> extend

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
serviceability easier and better extend

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.450 
serviceability easier and better extend
service<00:00:43.260> intervals<00:00:43.710> to<00:00:43.920> lower<00:00:44.100> maintenance

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
service intervals to lower maintenance

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:48.739 
service intervals to lower maintenance
costs<00:00:45.120> and<00:00:45.710> make<00:00:46.710> it<00:00:46.890> easier<00:00:47.249> for<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.789> owners

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:48.749 
costs and make it easier for the owners

00:00:48.749 --> 00:00:52.130 
costs and make it easier for the owners
and<00:00:49.050> operators<00:00:49.589> of<00:00:50.129> them<00:00:50.249> to<00:00:50.809> work<00:00:51.809> with<00:00:52.019> the

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
and operators of them to work with the

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.509 
and operators of them to work with the
machine<00:00:52.440> over<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:52.800> long<00:00:52.979> period<00:00:53.309> of<00:00:53.339> time

00:00:53.509 --> 00:00:53.519 
machine over the long period of time

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:55.669 
machine over the long period of time
that<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:53.819> Honan<00:00:54.239> so<00:00:54.510> a<00:00:54.870> lot<00:00:55.170> of<00:00:55.199> things<00:00:55.469> that

00:00:55.669 --> 00:00:55.679 
that the Honan so a lot of things that

00:00:55.679 --> 00:00:58.099 
that the Honan so a lot of things that
we've<00:00:55.979> done<00:00:56.219> on<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.120> machines<00:00:57.479> again<00:00:57.809> to<00:00:57.960> make

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
we've done on the machines again to make

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.309 
we've done on the machines again to make
that<00:00:58.289> get<00:00:58.589> better<00:00:58.769> for<00:00:59.069> the<00:00:59.159> owner/operator

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:00.319 
that get better for the owner/operator

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:02.450 
that get better for the owner/operator
particularly<00:01:01.319> when<00:01:01.710> we<00:01:01.800> start<00:01:02.039> looking<00:01:02.159> at

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
particularly when we start looking at

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.399 
particularly when we start looking at
the<00:01:02.639> operator<00:01:03.059> comfort<00:01:03.359> one<00:01:04.050> of<00:01:04.140> the<00:01:04.229> things

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
the operator comfort one of the things

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.410 
the operator comfort one of the things
we've<00:01:04.559> done<00:01:04.589> is<00:01:04.800> moved<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.220> cab<00:01:05.489> forward<00:01:05.909> two

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
we've done is moved the cab forward two

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.420 
we've done is moved the cab forward two
inches<00:01:06.840> on<00:01:06.899> these<00:01:07.259> machines<00:01:07.500> so<00:01:08.280> you're

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
inches on these machines so you're

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.190 
inches on these machines so you're
closer<00:01:08.700> to<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:09.060> work<00:01:09.299> area<00:01:09.509> it's<00:01:09.780> easier<00:01:10.049> to

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
closer to the work area it's easier to

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:12.530 
closer to the work area it's easier to
see<00:01:10.350> your<00:01:10.530> attachments<00:01:11.159> easier<00:01:11.850> to<00:01:12.030> see<00:01:12.270> the

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:12.540 
see your attachments easier to see the

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.630 
see your attachments easier to see the
work<00:01:13.409> that<00:01:13.649> you're<00:01:13.829> doing<00:01:13.860> at<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.369> front<00:01:14.490> of

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
work that you're doing at the front of

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.149 
work that you're doing at the front of
the<00:01:14.729> machine<00:01:15.060> so<00:01:15.090> that's<00:01:15.630> a<00:01:15.840> big<00:01:16.290> feature<00:01:16.560> here

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
the machine so that's a big feature here

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.639 
the machine so that's a big feature here
and<00:01:17.640> we<00:01:17.850> can<00:01:18.030> actually<00:01:18.210> get<00:01:18.630> inside<00:01:19.200> the<00:01:19.439> cab

00:01:19.639 --> 00:01:19.649 
and we can actually get inside the cab

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:23.209 
and we can actually get inside the cab
and<00:01:20.130> look<00:01:20.610> at<00:01:20.880> it<00:01:21.600> what's<00:01:21.930> in<00:01:22.110> here<00:01:22.380> the<00:01:22.950> door

00:01:23.209 --> 00:01:23.219 
and look at it what's in here the door

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:28.010 
and look at it what's in here the door
is<00:01:23.460> a<00:01:24.590> one-piece<00:01:25.590> glass<00:01:26.219> door<00:01:26.640> where<00:01:26.969> we<00:01:27.240> again

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:28.020 
is a one-piece glass door where we again

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.380 
is a one-piece glass door where we again
open<00:01:28.409> that<00:01:28.530> area<00:01:28.799> up<00:01:28.920> for<00:01:29.219> more<00:01:29.399> visibility<00:01:30.060> it

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
open that area up for more visibility it

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.389 
open that area up for more visibility it
fits<00:01:30.750> into<00:01:30.990> a<00:01:31.140> pocketed<00:01:31.770> channel<00:01:32.159> at<00:01:32.280> the

00:01:32.389 --> 00:01:32.399 
fits into a pocketed channel at the

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:34.969 
fits into a pocketed channel at the
front<00:01:32.700> so<00:01:32.880> it<00:01:32.969> seals<00:01:33.270> very<00:01:33.570> well<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:34.409> cab<00:01:34.649> is<00:01:34.859> a

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
front so it seals very well the cab is a

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:37.249 
front so it seals very well the cab is a
pressurized<00:01:35.609> cab<00:01:35.969> so<00:01:36.659> with<00:01:37.140> the

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
pressurized cab so with the

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.139 
pressurized cab so with the
air-conditioning<00:01:38.130> and<00:01:38.250> heating<00:01:38.310> system<00:01:39.060> you

00:01:39.139 --> 00:01:39.149 
air-conditioning and heating system you

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:41.510 
air-conditioning and heating system you
know<00:01:39.299> keep<00:01:39.990> the<00:01:40.170> interior<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.829> cab<00:01:41.009> cleaner

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
know keep the interior the cab cleaner

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.429 
know keep the interior the cab cleaner
keeps<00:01:42.000> that<00:01:42.210> dust<00:01:42.509> off<00:01:42.750> by<00:01:42.960> having<00:01:43.350> that

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
keeps that dust off by having that

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.709 
keeps that dust off by having that
pressurization<00:01:44.070> this<00:01:44.850> particular<00:01:45.390> machine

00:01:45.709 --> 00:01:45.719 
pressurization this particular machine

00:01:45.719 --> 00:01:48.770 
pressurization this particular machine
has<00:01:45.750> joystick<00:01:46.679> controls<00:01:47.130> in<00:01:47.340> it<00:01:47.490> and<00:01:47.780> there
