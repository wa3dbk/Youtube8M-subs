it's<00:04:40.110> not<00:04:40.259> that<00:04:40.470> we<00:04:41.370> stem<00:04:41.610> the<00:04:41.759> stern<00:04:42.320> over<00:04:43.320> the

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:43.410 
it's not that we stem the stern over the

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:45.860 
it's not that we stem the stern over the
face<00:04:43.650> kind<00:04:44.009> of<00:04:44.070> feeling<00:04:44.460> of<00:04:44.610> rebirth<00:04:45.570> so<00:04:45.810> to

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:45.870 
face kind of feeling of rebirth so to

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:47.240 
face kind of feeling of rebirth so to
speak<00:04:46.139> and<00:04:46.320> so<00:04:46.440> I<00:04:46.470> think<00:04:46.770> that's<00:04:46.919> the<00:04:47.070> big

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:47.250

speak and so I think that's the big
advantage<00:04:47.669> and<00:04:47.849> that's<00:04:48.000> what<00:04:48.150> people<00:04:48.419> seem<00:04:48.900> to

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:49.050 
advantage and that's what people seem to

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:50.960 
advantage and that's what people seem to
talk<00:04:49.349> about<00:04:49.500> it<00:04:49.800> is<00:04:49.919> feel<00:04:50.160> fresher<00:04:50.490> after<00:04:50.880> the

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:50.970 
talk about it is feel fresher after the

00:04:50.970 --> 00:04:52.879 
talk about it is feel fresher after the
procedure<00:04:51.120> a<00:04:51.570> unique<00:04:52.110> thing<00:04:52.380> about<00:04:52.410> the<00:04:52.710> pro

00:04:52.879 --> 00:04:52.889 
procedure a unique thing about the pro

00:04:52.889 --> 00:04:55.279 
procedure a unique thing about the pro
laser<00:04:53.160> is<00:04:53.460> that<00:04:53.849> superficial<00:04:54.539> thermal<00:04:54.930> effect

00:04:55.279 --> 00:04:55.289 
laser is that superficial thermal effect

00:04:55.289 --> 00:04:57.680 
laser is that superficial thermal effect
and<00:04:55.919> what<00:04:56.070> that<00:04:56.220> does<00:04:56.430> is<00:04:56.460> if<00:04:56.940> in<00:04:57.270> itself

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:57.690 
and what that does is if in itself

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:59.900 
and what that does is if in itself

this<00:05:00.479> procedure<00:05:00.690> is<00:05:00.990> kind<00:05:01.289> of<00:05:01.380> like<00:05:01.440> a<00:05:01.500> thermal

00:05:01.939 --> 00:05:01.949 
this procedure is kind of like a thermal

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:03.800 
this procedure is kind of like a thermal
peel<00:05:02.190> it's<00:05:02.729> like<00:05:02.880> a<00:05:02.910> peel<00:05:03.150> but<00:05:03.330> it's<00:05:03.449> a<00:05:03.479> thermal

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:06.140 
peel it's like a peel but it's a thermal
