 How to convert mp3 from format m 4 a 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:29.950
 I think that I want to explain, but now itunes though 

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:31.880
 In this way voice notes have when you synchronize a voice memo 

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:35.480
 With voice memo 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.820
 What you recorded sounds like this 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:43.030
 In a 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:47.250
 Click on this but this is I'm a state in which the turn to really completely in Mac 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:53.160
 Drag and drop 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:53.750
 It is copied here as m 4 a format like this 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:01:00.770
 so 

00:00:53.750 --> 00:01:06.320
 Upload to the server as it is in this format, for example, Mr. Tokusan and Kanye 

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:08.480
 You can of course also ask the Internet radio, but this format m 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:14.690
 4 When the remains of a 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:17.670
 In Toka not listen not to the download Well once once by the browser 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:23.430
 There is also a possibility that can not be heard in the real time 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:28.950
 Also, depending on the browser, I can not hear that I already have some experience 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:32.620
 In fact the Tteyuu whether made by going to the Toka Well its respective Purauza future 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:35.950
 That, for example, act red you're carrying are using 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:39.580
 Come and do you think changed by Toka I'm good or I that PC I container s 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:42.170
 So I 'm not the first but I will convert this to mp3 

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:44.810
 Is the conversion method 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:47.790
 This is also itunes 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:52.170
 Right-click well with this current version 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:54.330
 If it is lucky click, there is a thing called the creation of mp3 version here 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.280
 Station this click 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:59.670
 Then you 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:07.620
 I think it is in the state of creating this now 

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:10.280
 A sound will be heard when finished and the numbers will be written here as well 

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:15.500
 It will be a thing Fe now 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:18.260
 I'm waiting for a minute, but now I'm getting noise and numbers came out here 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:21.319
 Then the state of np 3 is good 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:25.790
 Now this since it was created here 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:28.849
 It is degree lock drag &amp; drop 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:35.060
 If you do so the name is also but I know together 

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:38.250
 It has been converted to mp3 It is safer to be uploaded to the server in this state -Widely 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:40.670
 The kana voice is get to listen to the Toka reader's 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:44.540
 This is because I think 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:48.459
 Convert voice memo from m 4 a to mp3 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.459
