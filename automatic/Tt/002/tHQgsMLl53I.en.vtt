00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.000 
switching more to the northwest that's

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.490 
switching more to the northwest that's
where<00:03:20.240> we're<00:03:20.390> getting<00:03:20.570> the<00:03:20.810> stronger<00:03:21.290> winds

00:03:21.490 --> 00:03:21.500

and also the colder air so it's starting

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.150 
and also the colder air so it's starting
to<00:03:23.720> happen<00:03:23.900> where<00:03:24.200> it's<00:03:24.320> filtering<00:03:24.680> in<00:03:24.890> so<00:03:25.040> it

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:25.160 
to happen where it's filtering in so it

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.940 
to happen where it's filtering in so it
feels<00:03:25.340> like<00:03:25.610> 21<00:03:26.120> degrees<00:03:26.270> right<00:03:26.660> now<00:03:26.720> in<00:03:27.080> the

west<00:03:47.959> but<00:03:48.410> here<00:03:48.650> in<00:03:48.739> the<00:03:48.860> immediate<00:03:49.160> area<00:03:49.550> in

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:49.940 
west but here in the immediate area in

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:51.580 
west but here in the immediate area in
the<00:03:50.239> tri-state<00:03:50.690> we<00:03:50.840> are<00:03:50.989> seeing<00:03:51.200> the<00:03:51.350> clouds

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:51.590 
the tri-state we are seeing the clouds

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:53.290 
the tri-state we are seeing the clouds
breaking<00:03:51.980> up<00:03:52.250> we've<00:03:52.400> got<00:03:52.430> mostly<00:03:52.970> clear<00:03:53.269> skies

00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:53.300
