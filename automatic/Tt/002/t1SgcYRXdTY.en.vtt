00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:13.000
 hi friends this time we will talk about a 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:15.250
 very important issue in the saga of 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.770
 star wars the breakthrough of the trilogies 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:18.580
 and one of the topics most investigated by 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:21.840
 the fans 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:21.840
 order 66 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:29.820
 we will begin with the meaning of said 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:32.250
 order according to some theories and some 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.559
 Confirmed facts are known to exist 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.870
 150 orders for the army of the 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.940
 republic this was secretly done 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.829
 by the people on the way before the start 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.660
 of the war with some of these 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.150
 orders are known and you can 

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:47.550
 search the Internet more not known 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:50.339
 that it was believed that this number was not 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:52.710
 chosen by coincidence we know that in 

00:00:50.339 --> 00:00:55.290
 the religious aspect the 6 has never been 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.210
 well seen relating to evil without 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:59.879
 But I'm going more to the theory that the 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:03.120
 66 is due to the sixth letter of the 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:05.789
 English alphabet is the f efe efe 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:08.460
 which could mean friendly fire or 

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:10.110
 for your translation fire friend this we 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.539
 explains a little more about the 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.720
 meaning of the order now let's start 

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:17.060
 with the facts 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:19.370
 I want to warn you that from this point 

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.860
 there are possible spoilers since I will take 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:23.480
 references of comics and series let's start 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:26.060
 by the start of the order as 

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:28.580
 we saw in episode 3 even though in 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.560
 my opinion was a very short cinematic 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.990
 this is the first time we saw in 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:35.120
 action this order at the beginning results 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.980
 somewhat confusing why this happens but 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:38.930
 after we know that for the skate 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:40.970
 has complete control over the 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:44.360
 troops for being the supreme chancellor we 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:46.190
 it is clearer the order 66 will be fair 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.530
 after darth vader is sent to 

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:50.869
 his first mission the first Jedi affected 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:53.270
 it is obi wan in these scenes followed by 

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:55.520
 dicky eklund's and then there's the 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.350
 cure blue cool this one came out and finally 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.900
 the iodine master have made multiple 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:02.210
 theories around these jr / is such 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:04.520
 like the commander of obi-wan kobe 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:06.200
 he felt angry with himself for 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.750
 to have returned the saber to obi wan 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.640
 seconds before shooting him since this one 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.430
 would have been a high value trophy in 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.110
 its military rank another theory but this 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.090
 Once with Aina, it is cured 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.800
 commander plate was in love with 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:20.440
 she and he regretted having 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.780
 obeyed the order and will kill 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:25.030
 this is confirmed in the clone comics 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.280
 wars where blaise is not very attracted 

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:29.560
 out there the same we see that it has something 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.920
 of envy jedi keeneland balls teacher 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:31.920
 from aila 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:39.470
 these data are not so unknown but 

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.840
 now we start with the data that we 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.099
 they provided the comics with the title 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:45.349
 Towards the unknown 

00:02:43.099 --> 00:02:47.090
 we started these stories that are of my 

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:49.310
 favorites and I would dare say that 

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.470
 they are better achieved than episode 3 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:54.170
 many jedis unlike what is 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:56.629
 believe they survived this order not all 

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:58.580
 by his abilities but by mere luck 

00:02:56.629 --> 00:02:59.209
 and some others for their power with the 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:01.099
 saber 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:03.530
 we begin with these stories with the 

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:05.510
 story of the temple and a Jedi who 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:07.430
 we see leave everything he learned in the 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:09.500
 order in order to achieve a new life 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:11.780
 the next geli I 'll call him lion since 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.579
 loquendo mispronounces his name x 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:16.220
 of this yeti is one of my favorites 

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:18.530
 after saving a group of Padawan is from 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.780
 the hands of the clones manages to live in 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:23.480
 peace for a time away from everything of 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:25.220
 the Jedi is a very long-lived character and 

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:27.230
 who lived until the time of the new 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:29.750
 republic these stories are made to me 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:31.849
 very good since none of these jedis 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:33.980
 I knew the future of the galaxy after this 

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:36.470
 war made everyone had to leave 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:38.299
 all his life to create a new me 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:40.950
 It would take hours to tell all the facts 

00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:43.400
 after the order so only more videos 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.400
 before 

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:49.200
 an interesting fact is that it is said that 

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:52.270
 there are clones that disobeyed the order 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:54.610
 66 these clones were searched by the 

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:56.739
 new empire to be killed together 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:58.510
 with the Jedi masters who defended themselves 

00:03:56.739 --> 00:04:00.130
 believes that the republic command was a 

00:03:58.510 --> 00:04:02.230
 team that did not obey the order and 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:04.360
 deserted this is because not all 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:06.430
 the clones developed the same way 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:08.560
 we saw in the series clone wars as 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:10.660
 some soldiers managed to think outside 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:13.420
 of the protocol by putting nicknames and 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:16.359
 fond of their generals jr and the 

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:18.400
 Order 66 not only brought a Jedi genocide 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:20.350
 also the slavery of many worlds 

00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:23.050
 who opposed the new mandates 

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:25.300
 of the empire there were clones that had 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:27.070
 remorse after the order does not 

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:29.080
 they understood why they had given the 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:32.729
 back to the republic and they were wondering 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:32.729
 if his acts were correct 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:39.090
 we know that the clones of 501 

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:41.100
 they had special training from this 

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:43.229
 mission attacking the temple jr and it was not 

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:44.789
 easy task the clones used a 

00:04:43.229 --> 00:04:47.460
 Rodeo technique towards the Jedi 

00:04:44.789 --> 00:04:49.530
 preventing it from returning the shots by 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:51.600
 stronger than they could not be against 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:53.850
 this technique despite all the comics 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:55.710
 and existing information the attack of 

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:57.479
 temple and eddie is left with many doubts already 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:59.520
 that there were still survivors that 

00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:00.689
 managed to escape but no one knows more about 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:03.149
 they 

00:05:00.689 --> 00:05:05.239
 there are still some things that I did not want 

00:05:03.149 --> 00:05:07.949
 put in this video but I'll do it in another 

00:05:05.239 --> 00:05:10.049
 I hope you liked it like and 

00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:12.389
 subscribe for more videos like this one 

00:05:10.049 --> 00:05:14.459
 can you see my other video theories of the 

00:05:12.389 --> 00:05:17.449
 saga in the description I leave the link 

00:05:14.459 --> 00:05:17.449
