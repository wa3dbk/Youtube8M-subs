00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:16.820 

so<00:00:15.929> let's<00:00:16.080> talk<00:00:16.199> a<00:00:16.260> little<00:00:16.320> bit<00:00:16.529> about<00:00:16.650> the

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
so let's talk a little bit about the

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.560 
so let's talk a little bit about the
ingredients<00:00:17.039> we're<00:00:17.880> not<00:00:18.060> doing<00:00:18.330> the<00:00:18.449> all

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:18.570 
ingredients we're not doing the all

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.870 
ingredients we're not doing the all
grain<00:00:18.840> method<00:00:19.260> we're<00:00:20.039> doing<00:00:20.310> the<00:00:20.460> extract

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
grain method we're doing the extract

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.570 
grain method we're doing the extract
method<00:00:21.150> so<00:00:21.539> we're<00:00:22.109> being<00:00:22.289> using<00:00:22.560> seven<00:00:23.130> pounds

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
method so we're being using seven pounds

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.750 
method so we're being using seven pounds
actually<00:00:23.939> a<00:00:23.970> dry<00:00:24.420> malt<00:00:24.779> extract<00:00:25.460> if<00:00:26.460> you<00:00:26.640> were

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
actually a dry malt extract if you were

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:28.310 
actually a dry malt extract if you were
doing<00:00:26.880> it<00:00:27.090> all<00:00:27.330> brain<00:00:27.570> nothing<00:00:27.990> you<00:00:28.199> would

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
doing it all brain nothing you would

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:29.750 
doing it all brain nothing you would
actually<00:00:28.590> be<00:00:28.680> extracting<00:00:29.189> this<00:00:29.310> yourself

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
actually be extracting this yourself

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.759 
actually be extracting this yourself
from<00:00:30.359> a<00:00:30.449> large<00:00:30.689> amount<00:00:30.990> of<00:00:31.050> drinks<00:00:31.410> but<00:00:31.650> what

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
from a large amount of drinks but what

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.430 
from a large amount of drinks but what
the<00:00:31.830> extract<00:00:32.189> method<00:00:32.930> saves<00:00:33.930> a<00:00:34.020> little<00:00:34.200> time

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
the extract method saves a little time

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.350 
the extract method saves a little time
and<00:00:35.390> you<00:00:36.390> just<00:00:36.450> add<00:00:36.780> this<00:00:37.050> to<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.380> pot<00:00:38.210> type<00:00:39.210> of

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
and you just add this to the pot type of

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.959 
and you just add this to the pot type of
brainy's<00:00:39.750> that<00:00:39.899> we're<00:00:39.989> going<00:00:40.140> to<00:00:40.230> be<00:00:40.379> using

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
different grades would be using and

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.900 
different grades would be using and

will be using Centennial hops and

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.709 
will be using Centennial hops and
Cascade<00:01:57.750> hops<00:01:58.189> we<00:01:59.189> are<00:01:59.340> using<00:01:59.549> the<00:02:00.030> actual<00:02:00.509> hot

Palace and you'll see how those work

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:04.700 
Palace and you'll see how those work
when<00:02:03.659> we're<00:02:03.780> doing<00:02:03.899> the<00:02:04.079> actual<00:02:04.350> brewing

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
when we're doing the actual brewing

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.950 
when we're doing the actual brewing
session<00:02:04.950> and<00:02:05.310> then<00:02:05.759> we're<00:02:05.939> using<00:02:06.149> a<00:02:06.540> cow

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
session and then we're using a cow

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.880 
session and then we're using a cow
for<00:02:07.140> me<00:02:07.260> a<00:02:07.290> least<00:02:08.060> to<00:02:09.060> get<00:02:09.209> things<00:02:09.509> all

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:09.890 
for me a least to get things all

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.980 
for me a least to get things all
fermented<00:02:10.890> up<00:02:11.330> so<00:02:12.330> one<00:02:12.540> that<00:02:12.690> gives<00:02:12.810> you<00:02:12.930> a

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:12.990 
fermented up so one that gives you a

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.350 
fermented up so one that gives you a
basic<00:02:13.200> idea<00:02:13.470> of<00:02:13.770> what<00:02:14.490> type<00:02:14.640> of<00:02:14.670> equipment<00:02:15.000> and

basic idea of what type of equipment and

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.760 
basic idea of what type of equipment and
ingredients<00:02:15.450> you<00:02:15.840> may<00:02:15.959> need<00:02:16.140> for<00:02:16.380> brewing<00:02:16.650> an
