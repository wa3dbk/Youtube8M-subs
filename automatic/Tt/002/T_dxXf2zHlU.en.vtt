why<00:01:49.770> try<00:01:50.009> to<00:01:50.070> remember<00:01:50.369> all<00:01:50.520> the<00:01:50.700> bytes<00:01:50.909> of

why try to remember all the bytes of

why try to remember all the bytes of

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:53.640 
data if it can't even be seen so this

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.639

you especially beginning in flash

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.230 
you especially beginning in flash
drawing<00:01:57.509> because<00:01:58.520> obviously<00:01:59.520> you<00:01:59.729> may<00:02:00.000> want

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
drawing because obviously you may want

drawing because obviously you may want
this<00:02:00.360> to<00:02:00.509> happen<00:02:00.689> you<00:02:01.170> can<00:02:01.320> create<00:02:01.560> some

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
this to happen you can create some

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:03.260 
this to happen you can create some
interesting<00:02:01.920> designs<00:02:02.430> by<00:02:02.729> cutting<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:03.180> way

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270

portions<00:02:03.780> of<00:02:03.869> other<00:02:04.020> shapes<00:02:04.380> but<00:02:05.040> if<00:02:05.130> it

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
portions of other shapes but if it

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.219 
portions of other shapes but if it
becomes<00:02:05.369> a<00:02:05.610> problematic<00:02:06.149> then<00:02:06.600> the<00:02:06.780> key<00:02:06.990> would

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
becomes a problematic then the key would

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.779 
becomes a problematic then the key would
be<00:02:07.259> to<00:02:07.380> put<00:02:07.680> your<00:02:08.509> merge<00:02:09.509> shapes<00:02:09.929> on

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
be to put your merge shapes on

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:13.059 
be to put your merge shapes on
separate<00:02:11.209> layers<00:02:11.480> that<00:02:12.379> kind<00:02:12.650> of<00:02:12.680> preserves

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 
separate layers that kind of preserves

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:16.270 
separate layers that kind of preserves
them<00:02:14.170> now<00:02:15.170> I<00:02:15.230> can<00:02:15.439> also<00:02:15.560> use<00:02:15.680> my<00:02:15.920> selection

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:16.280 
them now I can also use my selection

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.679 
them now I can also use my selection
tool<00:02:16.549> and<00:02:16.579> put<00:02:16.849> it<00:02:16.939> on<00:02:17.000> the<00:02:17.090> border<00:02:17.420> of<00:02:17.450> one<00:02:17.599> of

00:02:17.679 --> 00:02:17.689 
tool and put it on the border of one of

00:02:17.689 --> 00:02:19.089 
tool and put it on the border of one of
these<00:02:17.750> shapes<00:02:18.019> and<00:02:18.230> notice<00:02:18.439> how<00:02:18.530> I<00:02:18.560> can<00:02:18.650> bend

00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:19.099 
these shapes and notice how I can bend

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:22.959 
these shapes and notice how I can bend
it<00:02:19.310> out<00:02:19.489> there<00:02:20.060> we<00:02:20.209> go<00:02:20.319> bend<00:02:21.319> it<00:02:21.530> in<00:02:21.730> let's<00:02:22.730> go

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:22.969 
it out there we go bend it in let's go

00:02:22.969 --> 00:02:26.470 
it out there we go bend it in let's go
over<00:02:23.150> to<00:02:23.180> this<00:02:23.329> one<00:02:23.650> and<00:02:24.650> that<00:02:24.859> in<00:02:25.209> then<00:02:26.209> this

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
over to this one and that in then this

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.569 
over to this one and that in then this
out<00:02:26.689> so<00:02:27.620> you<00:02:27.709> can<00:02:27.829> really<00:02:27.859> create<00:02:28.340> some<00:02:28.459> nice

00:02:28.569 --> 00:02:28.579 
out so you can really create some nice

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:33.059 
out so you can really create some nice
curves<00:02:29.180> and<00:02:29.390> some<00:02:29.689> new<00:02:30.019> and<00:02:30.230> unusual<00:02:30.470> shapes

00:02:33.059 --> 00:02:33.069 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:35.259 

okay<00:02:34.069> I've<00:02:34.220> got<00:02:34.370> my<00:02:34.489> selection<00:02:34.939> tool<00:02:34.970> I'm

00:02:35.259 --> 00:02:35.269 
okay I've got my selection tool I'm

00:02:35.269 --> 00:02:36.789 
okay I've got my selection tool I'm
gonna<00:02:35.450> go<00:02:35.540> and<00:02:35.659> draw<00:02:35.810> a<00:02:35.840> box<00:02:36.049> around<00:02:36.290> both<00:02:36.650> of

00:02:36.789 --> 00:02:36.799 
gonna go and draw a box around both of

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:38.559 
gonna go and draw a box around both of
these<00:02:36.859> merge<00:02:37.099> shapes<00:02:37.370> and<00:02:37.700> delete<00:02:38.329> them<00:02:38.450> so

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:38.569 
these merge shapes and delete them so

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:40.479 
these merge shapes and delete them so
I'm<00:02:38.659> back<00:02:38.780> to<00:02:38.959> a<00:02:39.019> blank<00:02:39.260> stage<00:02:39.530> let's<00:02:40.280> show<00:02:40.400> you

00:02:40.479 --> 00:02:40.489 
I'm back to a blank stage let's show you

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:42.819 
I'm back to a blank stage let's show you
slight<00:02:40.730> little<00:02:40.849> variation<00:02:41.510> got<00:02:42.139> my<00:02:42.260> rectangle

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:42.829 
slight little variation got my rectangle

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:45.309 
slight little variation got my rectangle
tool<00:02:42.980> key<00:02:43.400> stroke<00:02:43.700> R<00:02:43.909> and<00:02:44.269> this<00:02:44.959> time<00:02:45.170> I'm

00:02:45.309 --> 00:02:45.319 
tool key stroke R and this time I'm

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:47.170 
tool key stroke R and this time I'm
going<00:02:45.409> to<00:02:45.470> click<00:02:45.620> my<00:02:45.859> drawing<00:02:46.220> object<00:02:46.819> there

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
going to click my drawing object there

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.059 
going to click my drawing object there
our<00:02:47.329> merge<00:02:47.569> shapes<00:02:47.930> and<00:02:48.260> there's<00:02:48.409> drawn

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:49.069 
our merge shapes and there's drawn

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:51.610 
our merge shapes and there's drawn
objects<00:02:49.700> we<00:02:50.090> go<00:02:50.209> ahead<00:02:50.359> and<00:02:50.480> click<00:02:50.780> this<00:02:51.019> and

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
objects we go ahead and click this and

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.470 
objects we go ahead and click this and
now<00:02:52.099> when<00:02:52.340> I<00:02:52.370> draw<00:02:52.459> a<00:02:52.639> rectangle<00:02:53.239> it<00:02:53.329> looks

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
now when I draw a rectangle it looks

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:54.849 
now when I draw a rectangle it looks
pretty<00:02:53.720> much<00:02:53.780> like<00:02:54.079> the<00:02:54.200> other<00:02:54.290> one<00:02:54.379> before

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:54.859 
pretty much like the other one before

00:02:54.859 --> 00:02:57.099 
pretty much like the other one before
but<00:02:55.400> notice<00:02:55.700> it<00:02:55.849> has<00:02:56.060> this<00:02:56.299> thin<00:02:56.689> border

00:02:57.099 --> 00:02:57.109 
but notice it has this thin border

00:02:57.109 --> 00:02:59.199 
but notice it has this thin border
around<00:02:57.260> it<00:02:57.650> if<00:02:57.980> I<00:02:58.069> go<00:02:58.220> to<00:02:58.280> selection<00:02:58.669> tool<00:02:59.000> V

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
around it if I go to selection tool V

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:01.770 
around it if I go to selection tool V
click<00:02:59.720> away<00:02:59.989> and<00:03:00.260> then<00:03:00.590> click<00:03:00.829> on<00:03:00.980> this

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:01.780 
click away and then click on this

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.940 
click away and then click on this
selecting<00:03:02.780> the<00:03:02.870> drawing<00:03:03.139> object<00:03:03.680> looks

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:03.950 
selecting the drawing object looks

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:05.649 
selecting the drawing object looks
different<00:03:04.340> than<00:03:04.430> selecting<00:03:04.909> a<00:03:05.030> merged<00:03:05.269> shape

00:03:05.649 --> 00:03:05.659 
different than selecting a merged shape

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:07.509 
different than selecting a merged shape
when<00:03:06.379> you<00:03:06.409> select<00:03:06.709> a<00:03:06.799> merge<00:03:06.980> shape<00:03:07.250> you<00:03:07.400> get

00:03:07.509 --> 00:03:07.519 
when you select a merge shape you get

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:09.159 
when you select a merge shape you get
all<00:03:07.609> this<00:03:07.730> old<00:03:07.879> dots<00:03:08.150> when<00:03:08.720> you<00:03:08.810> select<00:03:09.079> to

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:09.169 
all this old dots when you select to

00:03:09.169 --> 00:03:10.509 
all this old dots when you select to
draw<00:03:09.349> an<00:03:09.409> object<00:03:09.829> you<00:03:09.889> get<00:03:10.040> a<00:03:10.069> border<00:03:10.400> around

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:10.519 
draw an object you get a border around

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:14.140 
draw an object you get a border around
it<00:03:10.819> and<00:03:12.129> notice<00:03:13.129> that<00:03:13.220> I<00:03:13.310> can't<00:03:13.579> select<00:03:13.849> just

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
it and notice that I can't select just

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:15.759 
it and notice that I can't select just
the<00:03:14.299> fill<00:03:14.510> or<00:03:14.540> the<00:03:14.750> border<00:03:15.109> separately<00:03:15.620> I

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:15.769 
the fill or the border separately I

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:17.740 
the fill or the border separately I
can't<00:03:16.250> still<00:03:16.519> skew<00:03:16.849> parts<00:03:17.180> of<00:03:17.269> it<00:03:17.389> so<00:03:17.599> I<00:03:17.629> do

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
can't still skew parts of it so I do

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.379 
can't still skew parts of it so I do
still<00:03:18.169> have<00:03:18.199> those<00:03:18.500> characteristics<00:03:18.949> I<00:03:19.639> can

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:20.389 
still have those characteristics I can

00:03:20.389 --> 00:03:23.949 
still have those characteristics I can
also<00:03:20.540> use<00:03:20.870> subselection<00:03:21.590> tool<00:03:21.709> a<00:03:22.840> click<00:03:23.840> on

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:23.959 
also use subselection tool a click on

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:25.330 
also use subselection tool a click on

go<00:05:04.479> to<00:05:04.539> the<00:05:04.810> smoothing<00:05:05.409> option<00:05:06.780> there<00:05:07.780> you<00:05:07.900> go

00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:08.050 
go to the smoothing option there you go

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:11.250 
go to the smoothing option there you go
it<00:05:08.260> can<00:05:08.349> keep<00:05:08.560> a<00:05:08.650> slight<00:05:08.860> Bend<00:05:09.570> but<00:05:10.570> it<00:05:10.690> cleans

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:11.260 
it can keep a slight Bend but it cleans

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:12.600 
it can keep a slight Bend but it cleans
it<00:05:11.500> up<00:05:11.560> a<00:05:11.680> little<00:05:11.830> bit<00:05:11.979> so<00:05:12.130> it<00:05:12.220> looks<00:05:12.400> a<00:05:12.490> little

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:12.610 
it up a little bit so it looks a little

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:15.020 
it up a little bit so it looks a little
it<00:05:12.970> just<00:05:13.150> looks<00:05:13.389> a<00:05:13.479> little<00:05:13.510> bit<00:05:13.720> nicer<00:05:14.110> for<00:05:14.139> you

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:15.030 
it just looks a little bit nicer for you

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:18.020 
it just looks a little bit nicer for you
and<00:05:16.030> of<00:05:16.150> course<00:05:16.180> then<00:05:16.479> we<00:05:16.570> have<00:05:16.690> ink<00:05:16.930> mode

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:18.030 
and of course then we have ink mode

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:20.189 
and of course then we have ink mode
it'll<00:05:19.030> smooth<00:05:19.270> things<00:05:19.510> out<00:05:19.599> a<00:05:19.659> little<00:05:19.840> bit<00:05:20.050> but

00:05:20.189 --> 00:05:20.199 
it'll smooth things out a little bit but

00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:21.510 
it'll smooth things out a little bit but
it<00:05:20.289> doesn't<00:05:20.560> help<00:05:20.650> you<00:05:20.770> so<00:05:20.979> much<00:05:21.159> it'll<00:05:21.340> really

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:21.520 
it doesn't help you so much it'll really

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:23.670 
it doesn't help you so much it'll really
keep<00:05:21.789> some<00:05:22.060> of<00:05:22.090> the<00:05:22.210> jaggedness<00:05:22.659> in<00:05:22.930> there<00:05:23.169> so

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:23.680 
keep some of the jaggedness in there so

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:25.589 
keep some of the jaggedness in there so
if<00:05:23.830> you're<00:05:23.979> really<00:05:24.280> artistic<00:05:25.000> you<00:05:25.300> might<00:05:25.449> go

00:05:25.589 --> 00:05:25.599 
if you're really artistic you might go
