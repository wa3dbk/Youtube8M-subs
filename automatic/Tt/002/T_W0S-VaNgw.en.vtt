00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
but basically on the map gold you can do

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.970 
but basically on the map gold you can do
this<00:00:33.780> knock<00:00:33.989> back<00:00:34.230> pretty<00:00:34.469> much<00:00:34.620> anywhere

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
this knock back pretty much anywhere

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.069 
this knock back pretty much anywhere
except<00:00:35.340> for<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:35.610> big<00:00:35.760> arches<00:00:36.239> because

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
except for the big arches because

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:39.470 
except for the big arches because
there's<00:00:37.260> no<00:00:37.380> barrier<00:00:37.649> like<00:00:38.280> on<00:00:38.550> top<00:00:38.940> of<00:00:39.360> that

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:39.480 
there's no barrier like on top of that

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:40.729 
there's no barrier like on top of that
and<00:00:39.570> there's<00:00:39.750> like<00:00:39.840> a<00:00:39.870> big<00:00:40.020> hole<00:00:40.230> in<00:00:40.260> the<00:00:40.469> arch

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
and there's like a big hole in the arch

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.250 
and there's like a big hole in the arch
so<00:00:41.520> what<00:00:41.940> if<00:00:42.300> you<00:00:42.390> use<00:00:42.600> knock<00:00:42.840> back<00:00:43.050> right

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
so what if you use knock back right

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.630 
so what if you use knock back right

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:24.800 
parish and um I actually kinda like
these<00:01:22.650> map<00:01:22.799> guys<00:01:23.009> I<00:01:23.340> think<00:01:23.850> Infinity<00:01:24.630> Ward

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
these map guys I think Infinity Ward

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.090 
these map guys I think Infinity Ward
actually<00:01:25.080> did<00:01:25.200> something<00:01:25.350> good<00:01:25.560> for<00:01:25.799> once<00:01:25.920> and

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
actually did something good for once and

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.679 
actually did something good for once and
build<00:01:26.340> some<00:01:26.460> good<00:01:26.610> maps<00:01:26.820> but<00:01:27.060> they're<00:01:27.600> still

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
build some good maps but they're still

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:30.020 
build some good maps but they're still
fun<00:01:27.930> to<00:01:27.960> glitch<00:01:28.200> out<00:01:28.380> of<00:01:28.560> I'm<00:01:28.920> not<00:01:29.549> on<00:01:29.670> this<00:01:29.790> map

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
fun to glitch out of I'm not on this map

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.399 
fun to glitch out of I'm not on this map
if<00:01:30.240> you<00:01:30.360> go<00:01:30.450> too<00:01:30.509> far<00:01:30.840> you'll<00:01:31.140> fall<00:01:31.380> right

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:31.409

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.289 
if you go too far you'll fall right
through<00:01:31.590> so<00:01:32.340> it's<00:01:32.460> not<00:01:32.549> like<00:01:32.700> hard<00:01:32.909> hat<00:01:33.090> where

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
through so it's not like hard hat where

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.330 
through so it's not like hard hat where
everything<00:01:34.140> solid<00:01:34.409> you<00:01:34.770> will<00:01:34.890> fall<00:01:35.100> through

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
everything solid you will fall through

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.100 
everything solid you will fall through
