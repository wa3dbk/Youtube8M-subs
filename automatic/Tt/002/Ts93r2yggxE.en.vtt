00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:16.400
 Here we are, it's our time. 

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:18.470
 make the cutlery door because until then 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:21.800
 We've done almost everything right. 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:23.750
 the base of the cup holder and now the 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.539
 is here you are seeing in 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.770
 red and blank here 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:31.880
 Let's see, then, how do we go? 

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:35.239
 do is separate the material to needle 1.75 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:38.420
 and the wire here I'm using right? 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:40.820
 a film the double worked paranÃ¡ 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:45.020
 runs back here and started working 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:48.680
 with the cord of 4 chains you go 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:53.629
 launch will skip the first point of the base and 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:59.420
 in the second you pass the needle and do the 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:01:03.739
 half a high point there again and again 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:05.649
 next point again half a point 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:09.289
 high 

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:14.360
 laci and the next point on the last point 

00:01:09.289 --> 00:01:17.540
 a half high point you will then have 36 

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:20.810
 high points worked but it is necessary to 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:24.860
 change the execution side so I loop and 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:29.049
 at the same point I do another medium 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:32.750
 high point loop again and at the same point 

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:35.600
 new half a high point then in case you 

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.799
 will have three half high points in it 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.869
 base point 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:41.720
 with this you have already changed the direction 

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:46.759
 of your hard work and at the next point 

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:51.200
 a half high point loop back into the 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:54.649
 near a half high point 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:58.369
 however I need to attach this side to the side 

00:01:54.649 --> 00:02:01.369
 from here and at the same point people 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:04.040
 the middle point high 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:07.280
 now you pass the needle through the first 

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:10.700
 point at the beginning pull on a loop and 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.380
 fasten the very low the stopping point 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.530
 good you will have the basis of your work 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:17.780
 ready what we need to do is 

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:20.209
 change the direction of execution 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:22.280
 so you'll throw the needle through 

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:25.190
 behind work you can not see 

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:27.290
 needle passes it here in front of the 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.470
 Come back here and wait. 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:32.150
 I'll pass on to you, you can follow 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:34.880
 I'm going to open here until I get no 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.860
 It is very easy now I'll get 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.220
 pass the needle here by point looks 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:42.920
 here you see needle came forward 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:44.959
 throw her back around the point 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.819
 and pull thrown out 

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:49.400
 I'm still here I need to pull 

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:53.150
 A new out there, I'm back here. 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:56.660
 I was behind the loop that you will have done 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:03:01.250
 one more point, it's okay to continue this 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:04.310
 needle way behind comes forward 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:05.150
 back back there pull yourself thrown to 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:07.430
 out 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:11.780
 Look, there you played with the two points here. 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:12.950
 ago lacquer low point near the 

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:15.890
 same thing 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.989
 the low one picking up from behind only 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:21.200
 a detail saw people 

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:23.269
 You do not increase point here by now. 

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:26.299
 that you did earlier is a point 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:29.720
 But what are you going to do now and only this? 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:33.739
 there is no increase because in fact 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:37.280
 the basis of the execution has already been made already 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:38.780
 defined the number of points in this 

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:42.820
 execution 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:46.370
 at the time we made the outline there 

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:49.340
 in that cord of jewelry chains 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:50.989
 so this way I need to focus better here 

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:53.810
 to be able to finish then I will not 

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:56.299
 keep on doing with you, I 'm not going 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:58.790
 finish missing one or two dots 

00:03:56.299 --> 00:04:01.010
 only I'll finish, I'll come back with the last one. 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:03.109
 point on the needle because it gets easier 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:05.420
 to show you the result 

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:07.940
 end of the jewelry I'm going there but I already 

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:11.180
 come here looks that then I ever did 

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:13.640
 so the entire outline just needs to close 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:15.500
 the last point on the needle and here I have 

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:18.829
 first you see the first point here 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:21.019
 People will stay cool 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:23.870
 from the front, I'm picking up the front 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:27.950
 Wait, it's a hard train here. 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:31.370
 pull thrown out i pulled and riddled 

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:34.280
 you will then have to change the direction of your 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:34.820
 to continue and I have seen how it is 

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:35.689
 which makes 

00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:41.059
 so 

00:04:35.689 --> 00:04:44.209
 one two three dots three chains 

00:04:41.059 --> 00:04:45.169
 loop at the next point you will make a point 

00:04:44.209 --> 00:04:47.539
 high 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:50.149
 so here I have a high point 

00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:53.239
 next rye point you will launch and 

00:04:50.149 --> 00:04:54.739
 you will make two high points in it 

00:04:53.239 --> 00:04:57.589
 base point 

00:04:54.739 --> 00:05:01.669
 Then began the fantasy point such here 

00:04:57.589 --> 00:05:05.089
 according to the chain 

00:05:01.669 --> 00:05:12.159
 high points again at the same point 

00:05:05.089 --> 00:05:16.879
 base loop high point at the next point 

00:05:12.159 --> 00:05:20.479
 repeat loop at next point new point 

00:05:16.879 --> 00:05:24.069
 High out there repeats for the third and 

00:05:20.479 --> 00:05:27.319
 last time on this continuity high point 

00:05:24.069 --> 00:05:31.039
 in the same base point you will 

00:05:27.319 --> 00:05:33.709
 work two high points to where 

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:35.539
 mine did not pull right now it goes 

00:05:33.709 --> 00:05:39.529
 I did the first one to repeat the same 

00:05:35.539 --> 00:05:43.009
 point made the second chain 

00:05:39.529 --> 00:05:48.019
 at the same point two high points I'm going 

00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:53.539
 there again in the next point a 

00:05:48.019 --> 00:05:55.099
 high point loop the last point again 

00:05:53.539 --> 00:05:57.909
 top of that career 

00:05:55.099 --> 00:06:00.949
 in the last point that was missing, right? 

00:05:57.909 --> 00:06:04.159
 passes its needle through the first point of 

00:06:00.949 --> 00:06:08.349
 roasted pull base and first rump 

00:06:04.159 --> 00:06:08.349
 career will be closed
