well<00:00:03.580> we're<00:00:03.760> here<00:00:04.000> in<00:00:04.060> another<00:00:04.420> section<00:00:04.810> of

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:04.930 
well we're here in another section of

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:07.470 
well we're here in another section of
the<00:00:05.020> transmission<00:00:05.620> area<00:00:05.859> @bd<00:00:06.279> power<00:00:06.520> and<00:00:06.819> what

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:07.480 
the transmission area @bd power and what

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:09.660 
the transmission area @bd power and what
we're<00:00:07.600> learning<00:00:07.720> now<00:00:08.049> is<00:00:08.080> all<00:00:08.950> about<00:00:09.400> these

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:09.670 
we're learning now is all about these

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:12.080 
we're learning now is all about these
transmissions<00:00:10.480> now<00:00:10.600> here<00:00:10.840> at<00:00:10.930> BT<00:00:11.199> power<00:00:11.410> they

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
transmissions now here at BT power they

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:14.580 
transmissions now here at BT power they
manufacture<00:00:13.090> these<00:00:13.209> transmissions<00:00:13.900> but<00:00:14.379> they

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:14.590 
manufacture these transmissions but they

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:16.890 
manufacture these transmissions but they
upgrade<00:00:15.100> them<00:00:15.250> to<00:00:15.699> performance<00:00:16.390> level<00:00:16.750> but

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:16.900 
upgrade them to performance level but

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:18.689 
upgrade them to performance level but
Brian<00:00:17.380> the<00:00:17.560> kata<00:00:17.770> the<00:00:17.890> question<00:00:18.430> I<00:00:18.490> want<00:00:18.670> to

00:00:18.689 --> 00:00:18.699 
Brian the kata the question I want to

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:20.730 
Brian the kata the question I want to
ask<00:00:18.850> you<00:00:19.090> is<00:00:19.300> what<00:00:20.050> causes<00:00:20.350> these

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:20.740 
ask you is what causes these

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:22.770 
ask you is what causes these
transmissions<00:00:21.460> to<00:00:21.610> fail<00:00:21.850> well<00:00:22.450> the<00:00:22.600> number

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:22.780 
transmissions to fail well the number

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:24.720 
transmissions to fail well the number
one<00:00:22.810> reason<00:00:23.530> for<00:00:23.560> transmissions<00:00:24.280> fail<00:00:24.520> is

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:24.730 
one reason for transmissions fail is

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:26.880 
one reason for transmissions fail is
heat<00:00:25.240> but<00:00:26.020> you<00:00:26.110> have<00:00:26.230> to<00:00:26.350> dig<00:00:26.500> a<00:00:26.530> little<00:00:26.620> bit

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:26.890 
heat but you have to dig a little bit

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:28.200 
heat but you have to dig a little bit
farther<00:00:27.130> and<00:00:27.340> actually<00:00:27.640> what<00:00:27.789> caused<00:00:28.060> that

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:28.210 
farther and actually what caused that

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:29.880 
farther and actually what caused that
he'd<00:00:28.480> dave<00:00:28.720> and<00:00:28.990> it's<00:00:29.350> of<00:00:29.470> course<00:00:29.619> the

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:29.890 
he'd dave and it's of course the

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:31.770 
he'd dave and it's of course the
slippage<00:00:30.640> of<00:00:30.760> the<00:00:30.820> clutches<00:00:31.270> that<00:00:31.300> has<00:00:31.539> caused

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:31.780 
slippage of the clutches that has caused

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:34.500 
slippage of the clutches that has caused
that<00:00:31.930> heat<00:00:32.860> to<00:00:33.010> build<00:00:33.160> so<00:00:33.760> anytime<00:00:34.030> you<00:00:34.329> put

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:34.510 
that heat to build so anytime you put

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:36.569 
that heat to build so anytime you put
all<00:00:34.719> that<00:00:34.870> horsepower<00:00:35.230> through<00:00:35.710> there<00:00:35.920> if<00:00:36.460> you

00:00:36.569 --> 00:00:36.579 
all that horsepower through there if you

00:00:36.579 --> 00:00:38.370 
all that horsepower through there if you
don't<00:00:36.760> have<00:00:36.910> the<00:00:37.120> pressure<00:00:37.690> the<00:00:37.989> hydraulic

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:38.380 
don't have the pressure the hydraulic

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:39.930 
don't have the pressure the hydraulic
pressure<00:00:38.590> against<00:00:38.950> the<00:00:39.100> clutches<00:00:39.610> to<00:00:39.730> hold

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:39.940 
pressure against the clutches to hold

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:41.760 
pressure against the clutches to hold
them<00:00:40.120> then<00:00:40.660> they<00:00:40.780> start<00:00:41.020> to<00:00:41.140> slip<00:00:41.320> that's<00:00:41.620> what

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:41.770 
them then they start to slip that's what

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:43.680 
them then they start to slip that's what
generates<00:00:41.980> the<00:00:42.280> heat<00:00:42.460> yes<00:00:43.000> that's<00:00:43.450> right<00:00:43.630> but

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:43.690 
generates the heat yes that's right but

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:45.690 
generates the heat yes that's right but
we<00:00:44.350> find<00:00:44.739> that<00:00:44.890> is<00:00:45.010> a<00:00:45.040> little<00:00:45.280> bit<00:00:45.399> more<00:00:45.520> than

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:45.700 
we find that is a little bit more than

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:46.740 
we find that is a little bit more than
pressures<00:00:46.030> required<00:00:46.210> for<00:00:46.690> the

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:46.750 
pressures required for the

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:48.360 
pressures required for the
high-performance<00:00:47.350> application<00:00:47.980> we<00:00:48.130> find

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:48.370 
high-performance application we find

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:50.190 
high-performance application we find
that<00:00:48.550> we<00:00:48.640> actually<00:00:48.850> have<00:00:49.180> to<00:00:49.329> add<00:00:49.480> clutch

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:50.200 
that we actually have to add clutch

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.080 
that we actually have to add clutch
material<00:00:50.710> and<00:00:50.860> that's<00:00:50.980> what<00:00:51.130> we<00:00:51.250> do<00:00:51.460> -<00:00:51.910> whether

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:52.090 
material and that's what we do - whether

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:54.090 
material and that's what we do - whether
it<00:00:52.239> be<00:00:52.270> the<00:00:52.329> ford<00:00:52.720> the<00:00:53.320> ellison<00:00:53.739> or<00:00:53.860> the<00:00:53.950> dodge

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:54.100 
it be the ford the ellison or the dodge

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.590 
it be the ford the ellison or the dodge
transmission<00:00:54.790> so<00:00:55.000> what<00:00:55.270> you're<00:00:55.420> talking

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:55.600 
transmission so what you're talking

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.330 
transmission so what you're talking
about<00:00:55.630> when<00:00:55.840> you<00:00:55.899> talk<00:00:56.020> about<00:00:56.079> clutches<00:00:56.649> these

00:00:57.330 --> 00:00:57.340 
about when you talk about clutches these

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:58.620 
about when you talk about clutches these
clutch<00:00:57.579> packs<00:00:57.850> right<00:00:58.090> here<00:00:58.420> you<00:00:58.480> got<00:00:58.600> some

00:00:58.620 --> 00:00:58.630 
clutch packs right here you got some

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:01.260 
clutch packs right here you got some
here<00:00:59.290> here<00:00:59.890> down<00:01:00.340> here<00:01:00.700> and<00:01:00.820> of<00:01:00.879> course<00:01:01.059> back

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:01.270 
here here down here and of course back

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:03.540 
here here down here and of course back
here<00:01:01.600> so<00:01:01.989> you<00:01:02.050> replace<00:01:02.530> all<00:01:02.770> those<00:01:02.980> that's

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:03.550 
here so you replace all those that's

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:05.039 
here so you replace all those that's
correct<00:01:03.790> we<00:01:03.940> replace<00:01:04.299> them<00:01:04.449> but<00:01:04.600> of<00:01:04.719> course<00:01:04.899> we

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:05.049 
correct we replace them but of course we

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:07.980 
correct we replace them but of course we
add<00:01:05.259> 25%<00:01:05.890> and<00:01:06.850> even<00:01:07.270> in<00:01:07.329> some<00:01:07.509> of<00:01:07.539> them<00:01:07.749> up<00:01:07.959> to

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:07.990 
add 25% and even in some of them up to

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:10.679 
add 25% and even in some of them up to
35%<00:01:08.799> more<00:01:09.100> clutch<00:01:09.399> material<00:01:09.939> to<00:01:10.090> it<00:01:10.209> -<00:01:10.359> so<00:01:10.569> that

00:01:10.679 --> 00:01:10.689 
35% more clutch material to it - so that

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:12.779 
35% more clutch material to it - so that
we<00:01:10.749> can<00:01:10.869> hold<00:01:11.049> that<00:01:11.259> torque<00:01:11.590> under<00:01:12.459> some<00:01:12.639> good

00:01:12.779 --> 00:01:12.789 
we can hold that torque under some good

00:01:12.789 --> 00:01:14.459 
we can hold that torque under some good
heavy<00:01:12.939> loads<00:01:13.179> okay<00:01:13.569> now<00:01:13.869> I<00:01:13.899> see<00:01:13.959> you<00:01:14.200> got<00:01:14.319> some

00:01:14.459 --> 00:01:14.469 
heavy loads okay now I see you got some

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:15.809 
heavy loads okay now I see you got some
other<00:01:14.619> pieces<00:01:15.009> over<00:01:15.219> here<00:01:15.280> you<00:01:15.490> got<00:01:15.609> these

00:01:15.809 --> 00:01:15.819 
other pieces over here you got these

00:01:15.819 --> 00:01:18.719 
other pieces over here you got these
planetary<00:01:16.749> and<00:01:16.959> I<00:01:17.020> see<00:01:17.560> a<00:01:17.859> slight<00:01:18.310> difference

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:18.729 
planetary and I see a slight difference

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:20.910 
planetary and I see a slight difference
in<00:01:18.880> the<00:01:18.999> planetary<00:01:19.479> yes<00:01:20.020> that's<00:01:20.259> right<00:01:20.380> here

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:20.920 
in the planetary yes that's right here

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.830 
in the planetary yes that's right here
we<00:01:21.039> have<00:01:21.069> the<00:01:21.399> stock<00:01:21.759> planet<00:01:22.209> which<00:01:22.359> is<00:01:22.389> an

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:22.840 
we have the stock planet which is an

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.859 
we have the stock planet which is an
aluminum<00:01:23.289> case<00:01:23.499> with<00:01:24.279> for<00:01:24.549> pinion<00:01:24.939> and<00:01:25.179> here

00:01:25.859 --> 00:01:25.869 
aluminum case with for pinion and here

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:28.260 
aluminum case with for pinion and here
we<00:01:25.990> have<00:01:26.200> the<00:01:26.590> modified<00:01:27.249> opinion<00:01:27.880> that<00:01:27.999> we<00:01:28.119> use

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 
we have the modified opinion that we use

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.169 
we have the modified opinion that we use
which<00:01:28.509> is<00:01:28.539> steel<00:01:28.929> and<00:01:29.649> we<00:01:29.889> have<00:01:29.920> six<00:01:30.819> planets

00:01:31.169 --> 00:01:31.179 
which is steel and we have six planets

00:01:31.179 --> 00:01:33.929 
which is steel and we have six planets
it's<00:01:31.689> able<00:01:31.929> to<00:01:32.049> to<00:01:32.770> transfer<00:01:33.219> all<00:01:33.399> that<00:01:33.429> torque

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:33.939 
it's able to to transfer all that torque

00:01:33.939 --> 00:01:36.269 
it's able to to transfer all that torque
and<00:01:34.060> horsepower<00:01:34.090> because<00:01:34.569> it's<00:01:35.560> through<00:01:36.130> this

00:01:36.269 --> 00:01:36.279 
and horsepower because it's through this

00:01:36.279 --> 00:01:38.160 
and horsepower because it's through this
these<00:01:36.789> pinions<00:01:37.240> and<00:01:37.509> through<00:01:37.659> this<00:01:37.810> planet

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.170 
these pinions and through this planet

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.169 
these pinions and through this planet
assembly<00:01:38.560> where<00:01:38.740> we<00:01:38.829> transfer<00:01:39.340> all<00:01:39.999> that

00:01:40.169 --> 00:01:40.179 
assembly where we transfer all that

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:42.449 
assembly where we transfer all that
torque<00:01:40.420> and<00:01:40.569> power<00:01:40.599> in<00:01:40.959> each<00:01:41.079> gear<00:01:41.380> I<00:01:41.560> can<00:01:42.279> see

00:01:42.449 --> 00:01:42.459 
torque and power in each gear I can see

00:01:42.459 --> 00:01:44.069 
torque and power in each gear I can see
why<00:01:42.609> you'd<00:01:42.789> have<00:01:42.819> to<00:01:43.090> beef<00:01:43.270> that<00:01:43.479> thing<00:01:43.719> up<00:01:43.899> now

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:44.079 
why you'd have to beef that thing up now

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:47.249 
why you'd have to beef that thing up now
when<00:01:45.039> you<00:01:45.159> try<00:01:45.369> to<00:01:45.399> increase<00:01:45.729> that<00:01:46.270> hydraulic

00:01:47.249 --> 00:01:47.259 
when you try to increase that hydraulic

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:49.080 
when you try to increase that hydraulic
pressure<00:01:47.649> in<00:01:47.859> there<00:01:47.979> how<00:01:48.310> do<00:01:48.369> you<00:01:48.520> do<00:01:48.700> that

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:49.090 
pressure in there how do you do that

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:51.480 
pressure in there how do you do that
the<00:01:49.569> hydraulic<00:01:49.929> pressure<00:01:50.139> is<00:01:50.349> increased<00:01:50.740> with

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:51.490 
the hydraulic pressure is increased with

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:53.459 
the hydraulic pressure is increased with
a<00:01:51.520> shift<00:01:51.849> kit<00:01:52.060> to<00:01:52.270> which<00:01:52.509> comprised<00:01:53.200> of<00:01:53.409> a

00:01:53.459 --> 00:01:53.469 
a shift kit to which comprised of a

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:55.230 
a shift kit to which comprised of a
number<00:01:54.069> of<00:01:54.159> Springs<00:01:54.429> as<00:01:54.639> you<00:01:54.759> can<00:01:54.909> see<00:01:55.090> in

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.240 
number of Springs as you can see in

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.239 
number of Springs as you can see in
valves<00:01:55.689> where<00:01:56.349> we<00:01:56.469> bring<00:01:56.619> the<00:01:56.770> pressure<00:01:57.009> up

00:01:57.239 --> 00:01:57.249 
valves where we bring the pressure up

00:01:57.249 --> 00:01:58.949 
valves where we bring the pressure up
but<00:01:57.429> you<00:01:57.549> know<00:01:57.669> just<00:01:58.479> increasing<00:01:58.929> the

00:01:58.949 --> 00:01:58.959 
but you know just increasing the

00:01:58.959 --> 00:02:00.870 
but you know just increasing the
pressure<00:01:59.229> we<00:02:00.009> have<00:02:00.039> some<00:02:00.369> problems<00:02:00.759> because

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:00.880 
pressure we have some problems because

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:03.239 
pressure we have some problems because
what<00:02:01.539> happens<00:02:01.929> is<00:02:02.109> take<00:02:02.560> for<00:02:02.709> instance<00:02:03.009> on<00:02:03.130> the

00:02:03.239 --> 00:02:03.249 
what happens is take for instance on the

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:06.269 
what happens is take for instance on the
Ford<00:02:03.489> accumulator<00:02:04.239> body<00:02:04.450> here<00:02:04.739> the<00:02:05.739> surfaces

00:02:06.269 --> 00:02:06.279 
Ford accumulator body here the surfaces

00:02:06.279 --> 00:02:08.820 
Ford accumulator body here the surfaces
are<00:02:06.549> not<00:02:06.819> not<00:02:07.509> level<00:02:08.140> so<00:02:08.349> therefore<00:02:08.709> we

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:08.830 
are not not level so therefore we

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:11.010 
are not not level so therefore we
actually<00:02:09.220> have<00:02:09.399> to<00:02:09.580> lap<00:02:10.060> these<00:02:10.330> surfaces<00:02:10.869> by

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.020 
actually have to lap these surfaces by

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:13.260 
actually have to lap these surfaces by
hand<00:02:11.290> to<00:02:11.830> make<00:02:11.980> sure<00:02:12.160> that<00:02:12.370> it's<00:02:12.550> nice<00:02:13.090> and

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
hand to make sure that it's nice and

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.620 
hand to make sure that it's nice and
level<00:02:13.390> so<00:02:13.720> that<00:02:13.750> the<00:02:14.110> pressure<00:02:14.380> in<00:02:14.710> that<00:02:14.740> circ

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
level so that the pressure in that circ

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.030 
level so that the pressure in that circ
it<00:02:15.690> actually<00:02:15.870> will<00:02:16.140> stay<00:02:16.380> in<00:02:16.500> that<00:02:16.680> circuit

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
it actually will stay in that circuit

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.500 
it actually will stay in that circuit
and<00:02:17.190> not<00:02:17.340> jump<00:02:17.610> over<00:02:17.880> and<00:02:18.000> go<00:02:18.120> into<00:02:18.270> the<00:02:18.480> next

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510 
and not jump over and go into the next

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:20.360 
and not jump over and go into the next
one<00:02:18.720> what<00:02:19.230> do<00:02:19.290> you<00:02:19.350> talk<00:02:19.710> about<00:02:19.740> here<00:02:19.980> folks<00:02:20.220> is

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
one what do you talk about here folks is

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.100 
one what do you talk about here folks is
when<00:02:20.520> he's<00:02:20.640> lapping<00:02:20.910> it<00:02:21.240> what<00:02:21.690> you<00:02:21.780> have<00:02:21.930> is

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
when he's lapping it what you have is

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.380 
when he's lapping it what you have is
the<00:02:22.230> Machine<00:02:22.620> surface<00:02:23.070> they<00:02:23.850> put<00:02:24.060> that<00:02:24.180> on<00:02:24.240> a

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
the Machine surface they put that on a

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.060 
the Machine surface they put that on a
surface<00:02:24.870> plate<00:02:25.140> and<00:02:25.290> lap<00:02:25.440> that<00:02:25.650> so<00:02:25.830> you<00:02:25.920> have

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
surface plate and lap that so you have

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.370 
surface plate and lap that so you have
an<00:02:26.190> absolutely<00:02:26.940> perfectly<00:02:27.630> flat<00:02:27.900> machine

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:28.380 
an absolutely perfectly flat machine

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.620 
an absolutely perfectly flat machine
surface<00:02:28.890> that<00:02:29.400> way<00:02:29.610> you<00:02:29.670> get<00:02:30.000> a<00:02:30.030> good<00:02:30.300> seal

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
surface that way you get a good seal

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:31.490 
surface that way you get a good seal
that's<00:02:31.110> right

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:31.500 
that's right

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.610 
that's right
now<00:02:32.150> talking<00:02:33.150> about<00:02:33.390> creating<00:02:34.290> the<00:02:34.380> pressure

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:34.620 
now talking about creating the pressure

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.430 
now talking about creating the pressure
though<00:02:34.920> once<00:02:35.160> you<00:02:35.220> get<00:02:35.370> that<00:02:35.460> pressure<00:02:35.820> up<00:02:36.440> you

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:37.440 
though once you get that pressure up you

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:38.900 
though once you get that pressure up you
got<00:02:37.590> these<00:02:37.770> shift<00:02:38.040> points<00:02:38.340> how<00:02:38.460> do<00:02:38.520> you<00:02:38.670> shift

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
got these shift points how do you shift

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:41.150 
got these shift points how do you shift
it<00:02:39.120> now<00:02:39.270> well<00:02:39.810> it's<00:02:39.990> all<00:02:40.140> shifted<00:02:40.560> right<00:02:40.920> here

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
it now well it's all shifted right here

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.860 
it now well it's all shifted right here
with<00:02:41.310> a<00:02:41.340> solenoid<00:02:41.640> pack<00:02:42.060> and<00:02:42.330> this<00:02:42.420> is<00:02:42.570> a<00:02:42.600> stock

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
with a solenoid pack and this is a stock

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.170 
with a solenoid pack and this is a stock
solenoid<00:02:43.410> pack<00:02:43.680> and<00:02:44.460> you<00:02:44.610> can<00:02:44.640> see<00:02:44.850> underneath

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
solenoid pack and you can see underneath

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.930 
solenoid pack and you can see underneath
is<00:02:45.450> orange<00:02:45.720> cover<00:02:45.930> here<00:02:46.200> is<00:02:46.830> a<00:02:46.890> circuit<00:02:47.730> board

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:47.940 
is orange cover here is a circuit board

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:50.090 
is orange cover here is a circuit board
which<00:02:48.360> we<00:02:48.810> find<00:02:49.080> that<00:02:49.260> often<00:02:49.650> breaks<00:02:49.890> up

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
which we find that often breaks up

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.620 
which we find that often breaks up
because<00:02:50.400> the<00:02:50.490> transmission<00:02:51.030> is<00:02:51.120> cooling<00:02:51.480> up

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
because the transmission is cooling up

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.600 
because the transmission is cooling up
heating<00:02:51.990> down<00:02:52.110> and<00:02:52.380> it<00:02:53.010> will<00:02:53.160> break<00:02:53.310> so

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
heating down and it will break so

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:54.830 
heating down and it will break so
actually<00:02:53.970> what<00:02:54.120> we've<00:02:54.270> done<00:02:54.480> to<00:02:54.660> all<00:02:54.750> the

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
actually what we've done to all the

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.230 
actually what we've done to all the
solenoids<00:02:55.290> is<00:02:55.470> we've<00:02:55.620> hardwired<00:02:56.160> them<00:02:56.310> so

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:57.240 
solenoids is we've hardwired them so

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.090 
solenoids is we've hardwired them so
that<00:02:57.540> we<00:02:57.660> don't<00:02:57.780> have<00:02:58.020> that<00:02:58.200> breakage<00:02:58.590> we're

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
that we don't have that breakage we're

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:01.160 
that we don't have that breakage we're
talking<00:02:59.400> about<00:02:59.720> increasing<00:03:00.720> the<00:03:00.780> life<00:03:00.930> of<00:03:01.110> the

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
talking about increasing the life of the

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:02.750 
talking about increasing the life of the
transmission<00:03:01.740> for<00:03:01.920> you<00:03:02.010> now<00:03:02.340> that's<00:03:02.520> pretty

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
transmission for you now that's pretty

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.850 
transmission for you now that's pretty
slick<00:03:03.120> now<00:03:03.330> you<00:03:03.390> also<00:03:03.780> mention<00:03:04.140> lubrication

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
slick now you also mention lubrication

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:06.890 
slick now you also mention lubrication
which<00:03:05.820> is<00:03:05.940> critical<00:03:06.420> in<00:03:06.510> this

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:06.900 
which is critical in this

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.180 
which is critical in this
what<00:03:07.200> are<00:03:07.260> you<00:03:07.350> doing<00:03:07.590> increased<00:03:08.010> lubrication

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
what are you doing increased lubrication

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.520 
what are you doing increased lubrication
well<00:03:09.120> on<00:03:09.240> the<00:03:09.360> forward<00:03:09.600> transmission<00:03:09.930> and<00:03:10.440> we

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:10.530 
well on the forward transmission and we

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.110 
well on the forward transmission and we
also<00:03:10.680> do<00:03:10.920> it<00:03:11.040> with<00:03:11.190> the<00:03:11.250> Dodge<00:03:11.460> transmission

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:12.120 
also do it with the Dodge transmission

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.940 
also do it with the Dodge transmission
but<00:03:12.240> this<00:03:12.720> is<00:03:12.870> the<00:03:12.990> intermediate<00:03:13.500> shaft<00:03:13.530> on

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
but this is the intermediate shaft on

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:15.590 
but this is the intermediate shaft on
the<00:03:14.040> Ford<00:03:14.280> and<00:03:14.460> what<00:03:14.940> we've<00:03:15.090> done<00:03:15.270> is<00:03:15.450> we've

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:15.600 
the Ford and what we've done is we've

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.120 
the Ford and what we've done is we've
actually<00:03:15.780> drilled<00:03:16.290> right<00:03:16.740> through<00:03:16.800> this

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
actually drilled right through this

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:18.710 
actually drilled right through this
intermediate<00:03:17.640> shaft<00:03:17.670> and<00:03:18.120> we've<00:03:18.510> also

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:18.720 
intermediate shaft and we've also

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.920 
intermediate shaft and we've also
installed<00:03:19.130> this<00:03:20.130> pilot<00:03:20.580> right<00:03:20.970> here<00:03:21.240> so<00:03:21.690> that

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:21.930 
installed this pilot right here so that

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.200 
installed this pilot right here so that
the<00:03:22.260> the<00:03:23.100> output<00:03:23.430> shaft<00:03:23.610> actually<00:03:23.970> is

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:24.210 
the the output shaft actually is

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:26.210 
the the output shaft actually is
supported<00:03:24.720> by<00:03:25.200> the<00:03:25.260> intermediate<00:03:25.770> shaft<00:03:25.830> -

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
supported by the intermediate shaft -

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:27.620 
supported by the intermediate shaft -
because<00:03:26.520> we<00:03:26.670> were<00:03:26.760> having<00:03:27.030> breakage<00:03:27.240> in<00:03:27.540> the

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
because we were having breakage in the

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:30.140 
because we were having breakage in the
shaft<00:03:27.900> so<00:03:28.110> not<00:03:28.320> only<00:03:28.440> did<00:03:28.680> we<00:03:28.830> get<00:03:29.370> the<00:03:29.790> benefit

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
shaft so not only did we get the benefit

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:31.700 
shaft so not only did we get the benefit
of<00:03:30.180> getting<00:03:30.390> more<00:03:30.660> lubrication<00:03:31.170> to<00:03:31.590> the

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:31.710 
of getting more lubrication to the

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:33.410 
of getting more lubrication to the
overdrive<00:03:31.950> planetary<00:03:32.640> on<00:03:32.760> this<00:03:32.940> but<00:03:33.300> with

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:33.420 
overdrive planetary on this but with

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:34.730 
overdrive planetary on this but with
support<00:03:33.750> of<00:03:33.780> the<00:03:33.900> counter<00:03:34.230> that's<00:03:34.500> right

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:34.740 
support of the counter that's right

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:36.590 
support of the counter that's right
exactly<00:03:34.980> that's<00:03:35.520> pretty<00:03:35.730> slick<00:03:36.000> I<00:03:36.150> like<00:03:36.330> that

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:36.600 
exactly that's pretty slick I like that

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:39.560 
exactly that's pretty slick I like that
all<00:03:37.530> right<00:03:37.680> now<00:03:37.890> I<00:03:38.220> also<00:03:38.700> noticed<00:03:39.270> that<00:03:39.390> you

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:39.570 
all right now I also noticed that you

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:41.390 
all right now I also noticed that you
have<00:03:40.140> your<00:03:40.350> oil<00:03:40.410> pan<00:03:40.800> here<00:03:41.070> this<00:03:41.220> is<00:03:41.280> your

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
have your oil pan here this is your

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:43.580 
have your oil pan here this is your
stock<00:03:41.640> pan<00:03:42.000> this<00:03:42.990> is<00:03:43.140> the<00:03:43.200> one<00:03:43.320> you<00:03:43.440> guys

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
stock pan this is the one you guys

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:45.620 
stock pan this is the one you guys
supply<00:03:44.040> now<00:03:44.220> this<00:03:44.340> is<00:03:44.459> a<00:03:44.520> beefy<00:03:44.940> aluminum<00:03:45.450> pan

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:45.630 
supply now this is a beefy aluminum pan

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:47.780 
supply now this is a beefy aluminum pan
I<00:03:45.660> like<00:03:45.959> that<00:03:46.200> the<00:03:46.650> reason<00:03:46.950> why<00:03:47.040> we<00:03:47.459> made<00:03:47.640> it

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
I like that the reason why we made it

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:50.180 
I like that the reason why we made it
beefy<00:03:48.120> like<00:03:48.300> that<00:03:48.480> is<00:03:48.690> to<00:03:48.959> prevent<00:03:49.800> a<00:03:49.890> couple

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
beefy like that is to prevent a couple

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.370 
beefy like that is to prevent a couple
of<00:03:50.280> things<00:03:50.550> and<00:03:50.820> one<00:03:50.940> of<00:03:50.970> them<00:03:51.180> is<00:03:51.780> the<00:03:52.170> the

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:52.380 
of things and one of them is the the

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:54.470 
of things and one of them is the the
torquing<00:03:52.800> of<00:03:52.980> the<00:03:53.430> housing<00:03:53.790> itself<00:03:54.120> because

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.480 
torquing of the housing itself because

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:55.820 
torquing of the housing itself because
of<00:03:54.510> the<00:03:54.720> amount<00:03:54.870> of<00:03:54.990> torque<00:03:55.230> that<00:03:55.410> the<00:03:55.560> engine

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:55.830 
of the amount of torque that the engine

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:57.410 
of the amount of torque that the engine
is<00:03:55.950> actually<00:03:56.100> putting<00:03:56.430> out<00:03:56.610> -<00:03:56.850> even<00:03:57.180> though

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 
is actually putting out - even though

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:59.720 
is actually putting out - even though
we've<00:03:57.600> lapped<00:03:57.870> the<00:03:58.020> surfaces<00:03:58.530> we<00:03:59.340> actually

00:03:59.720 --> 00:03:59.730 
we've lapped the surfaces we actually

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:03.710 
we've lapped the surfaces we actually
end<00:03:59.940> up<00:04:00.350> removing<00:04:01.350> that<00:04:02.180> surface<00:04:03.180> contact

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:03.720 
end up removing that surface contact

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.630 
end up removing that surface contact
because<00:04:04.080> the<00:04:04.200> case<00:04:04.380> actually<00:04:04.620> works<00:04:05.040> so

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 
because the case actually works so

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:07.520 
because the case actually works so
therefore<00:04:06.000> that<00:04:06.120> increases<00:04:07.050> the<00:04:07.140> strength<00:04:07.350> of

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
therefore that increases the strength of

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:09.560 
therefore that increases the strength of
the<00:04:07.620> case<00:04:07.800> added<00:04:08.640> capacity<00:04:08.790> of<00:04:09.360> course

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:09.570 
the case added capacity of course

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:11.750 
the case added capacity of course
additional<00:04:10.320> oil<00:04:10.620> cooling<00:04:11.040> and<00:04:11.220> the<00:04:11.340> fins<00:04:11.580> of

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
additional oil cooling and the fins of

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.970 
additional oil cooling and the fins of
course<00:04:12.000> have<00:04:12.780> additional<00:04:13.320> oil<00:04:13.440> cooling<00:04:13.860> as

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980 
course have additional oil cooling as

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:15.590 
course have additional oil cooling as
well<00:04:14.010> that<00:04:14.670> makes<00:04:15.030> a<00:04:15.150> pretty<00:04:15.390> nice

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:15.600 
well that makes a pretty nice

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.539 
well that makes a pretty nice
transmission<00:04:16.260> now<00:04:16.380> you<00:04:16.950> can<00:04:17.130> get<00:04:17.310> these

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
transmission now you can get these

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:20.270 
transmission now you can get these
rebuilt<00:04:18.299> transmissions<00:04:18.989> from<00:04:19.230> you<00:04:19.410> or<00:04:19.620> you

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
rebuilt transmissions from you or you

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:21.710 
rebuilt transmissions from you or you
can<00:04:20.430> actually<00:04:20.580> get<00:04:20.880> components<00:04:21.420> for<00:04:21.630> them

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 
can actually get components for them

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:22.520 
can actually get components for them
right<00:04:21.840> exactly

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:22.530 
right exactly

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:24.800 
right exactly
take<00:04:23.070> for<00:04:23.250> instance<00:04:23.310> here<00:04:24.120> we<00:04:24.150> have<00:04:24.419> the<00:04:24.600> Dodge

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:24.810 
take for instance here we have the Dodge

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:26.150 
take for instance here we have the Dodge
valve<00:04:25.140> body<00:04:25.410> which<00:04:25.680> we<00:04:25.860> make<00:04:26.040> the

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160 
valve body which we make the

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:27.890 
valve body which we make the
modifications<00:04:26.880> to<00:04:26.970> we<00:04:27.270> put<00:04:27.390> all<00:04:27.510> the<00:04:27.630> shifts

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 
modifications to we put all the shifts

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:29.299 
modifications to we put all the shifts
kit<00:04:28.050> components<00:04:28.590> in<00:04:28.710> there

00:04:29.299 --> 00:04:29.309 
kit components in there

00:04:29.309 --> 00:04:30.589 
kit components in there
and<00:04:29.489> we<00:04:29.579> do<00:04:29.699> all<00:04:29.849> the<00:04:29.999> testing<00:04:30.359> on<00:04:30.419> these

00:04:30.589 --> 00:04:30.599 
and we do all the testing on these

00:04:30.599 --> 00:04:32.689 
and we do all the testing on these
before<00:04:31.139> you<00:04:31.799> actually<00:04:32.189> put<00:04:32.399> them<00:04:32.519> in<00:04:32.609> your

00:04:32.689 --> 00:04:32.699 
before you actually put them in your

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:34.219 
before you actually put them in your
truck<00:04:32.969> so<00:04:33.119> we're<00:04:33.269> assured<00:04:33.569> that<00:04:33.899> they<00:04:34.049> work

00:04:34.219 --> 00:04:34.229 
truck so we're assured that they work

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:36.019 
truck so we're assured that they work
out<00:04:34.439> the<00:04:35.129> way<00:04:35.249> that<00:04:35.429> they're<00:04:35.549> supposed<00:04:35.579> to<00:04:35.909> the

00:04:36.019 --> 00:04:36.029 
out the way that they're supposed to the

00:04:36.029 --> 00:04:37.069 
out the way that they're supposed to the
way<00:04:36.059> we<00:04:36.269> want<00:04:36.449> we<00:04:36.509> have<00:04:36.599> the<00:04:36.749> accumulator

00:04:37.069 --> 00:04:37.079 
way we want we have the accumulator

00:04:37.079 --> 00:04:40.129 
way we want we have the accumulator
bodies<00:04:37.589> and<00:04:37.799> in<00:04:37.859> exchange<00:04:38.269> as<00:04:39.269> well<00:04:39.569> so<00:04:39.959> that

00:04:40.129 --> 00:04:40.139 
bodies and in exchange as well so that

00:04:40.139 --> 00:04:41.329 
bodies and in exchange as well so that
we<00:04:40.319> can<00:04:40.469> just<00:04:40.619> send<00:04:40.769> them<00:04:40.859> out<00:04:40.949> and<00:04:41.099> you<00:04:41.189> can

00:04:41.329 --> 00:04:41.339 
we can just send them out and you can

00:04:41.339 --> 00:04:42.499 
we can just send them out and you can
install<00:04:41.549> them<00:04:41.639> at<00:04:41.759> home<00:04:41.909> it<00:04:42.029> makes<00:04:42.239> it<00:04:42.389> a<00:04:42.419> lot

00:04:42.499 --> 00:04:42.509 
install them at home it makes it a lot

00:04:42.509 --> 00:04:43.999 
install them at home it makes it a lot
better<00:04:42.569> than<00:04:42.989> just<00:04:43.139> getting<00:04:43.319> a<00:04:43.409> shift<00:04:43.649> kit<00:04:43.859> and

00:04:43.999 --> 00:04:44.009 
better than just getting a shift kit and

00:04:44.009 --> 00:04:45.619 
better than just getting a shift kit and
trying<00:04:44.189> to<00:04:44.279> put<00:04:44.459> all<00:04:44.579> that<00:04:44.699> stuff<00:04:44.759> in<00:04:45.179> yourself
