00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
jump or fly over her head yes these

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.800 
jump or fly over her head yes these
awkward<00:01:23.280> one<00:01:23.430> to<00:01:23.580> overcome<00:01:23.729> that's<00:01:24.420> right<00:01:24.780> oh

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
awkward one to overcome that's right oh

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.690 
awkward one to overcome that's right oh
by<00:01:25.140> it's<00:01:25.290> almost<00:01:25.560> like<00:01:25.770> a<00:01:25.799> forcefield<00:01:26.340> banner

if you will certainly then it seems

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:29.600 
if you will certainly then it seems
she's<00:01:28.740> going<00:01:28.920> to<00:01:29.009> be<00:01:29.100> a<00:01:29.130> very<00:01:29.400> powerful

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
she's going to be a very powerful
