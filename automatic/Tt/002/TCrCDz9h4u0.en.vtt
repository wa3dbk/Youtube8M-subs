us on the recording that it's just a

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.290 
us on the recording that it's just a
little<00:00:46.530> thing<00:00:46.800> but<00:00:47.670> it<00:00:47.850> really<00:00:47.880> makes<00:00:48.240> a

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300 
little thing but it really makes a

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.840 
little thing but it really makes a
difference<00:00:48.350> when<00:00:49.350> he<00:00:49.380> played<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:49.890> D<00:00:50.190> note<00:00:50.550> on

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
the riff that it's not right here

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.260 
the riff that it's not right here
he<00:00:55.050> didn't<00:00:55.320> just<00:00:55.530> play<00:00:55.820> you<00:00:56.820> know<00:00:56.910> the<00:00:56.940> fifth

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
and what he did was he actually banded

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.950 
and what he did was he actually banded
the<00:01:16.340> stream<00:01:16.820> a<00:01:17.000> little<00:01:17.420> bit<00:01:19.420> while<00:01:20.420> still

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960 
the stream a little bit while still

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:26.319 
the stream a little bit while still
playing<00:01:21.259> the<00:01:21.439> open<00:01:21.860> D<00:01:21.979> string<00:01:22.009> to<00:01:25.329> create

00:01:26.319 --> 00:01:26.329 
playing the open D string to create

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:32.170 
playing the open D string to create
almost<00:01:26.509> like<00:01:26.689> a<00:01:26.810> chorus<00:01:27.289> sound<00:01:28.869> you<00:01:29.869> hear<00:01:30.020> that

so<00:01:33.020> actually<00:01:33.530> the<00:01:33.680> graph<00:01:33.860> goes<00:01:34.100> like<00:01:34.280> this

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750
