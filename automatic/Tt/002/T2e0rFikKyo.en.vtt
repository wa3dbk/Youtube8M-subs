whats up guys its chaos and today I'm
going<00:00:11.550> to<00:00:11.610> talk<00:00:11.790> to<00:00:11.849> you<00:00:12.059> about<00:00:12.210> a<00:00:12.389> little<00:00:12.510> bit

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
going to talk to you about a little bit

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:16.370 
going to talk to you about a little bit
of<00:00:13.170> my<00:00:13.620> redneck<00:00:14.160> fun<00:00:14.490> this<00:00:15.360> right<00:00:15.630> here<00:00:15.929> is<00:00:16.020> a

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:16.380 
of my redneck fun this right here is a

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:19.070 
of my redneck fun this right here is a
spud<00:00:16.830> scut<00:00:17.160> also<00:00:17.610> known<00:00:17.910> as<00:00:18.180> a<00:00:18.210> potato<00:00:18.689> cannon

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
spud scut also known as a potato cannon

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.769 
spud scut also known as a potato cannon
it<00:00:19.890> can<00:00:20.070> be<00:00:20.160> used<00:00:20.369> to<00:00:20.669> launch<00:00:20.849> potatoes<00:00:21.509> apples

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:21.779 
it can be used to launch potatoes apples

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.380 
it can be used to launch potatoes apples
and<00:00:22.320> anything<00:00:22.649> else<00:00:22.739> fibers<00:00:23.279> and<00:00:23.399> cheap<00:00:23.669> with

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
and anything else fibers and cheap with

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.389 
and anything else fibers and cheap with
hairspray<00:00:24.930> propellant<00:00:25.590> at<00:00:25.680> very<00:00:26.309> high

00:00:26.389 --> 00:00:26.399 
hairspray propellant at very high

00:00:26.399 --> 00:00:34.729 
hairspray propellant at very high
velocities<00:00:32.930> okay<00:00:33.930> so<00:00:33.989> how<00:00:34.290> this<00:00:34.469> thing<00:00:34.710> works

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
velocities okay so how this thing works

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.220 
velocities okay so how this thing works
is<00:00:35.399> you<00:00:35.700> put<00:00:35.940> your<00:00:36.060> hairspray<00:00:36.390> in<00:00:36.660> here<00:00:36.960> your

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
is you put your hairspray in here your

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.700 
is you put your hairspray in here your
propellant<00:00:37.620> and<00:00:37.910> then<00:00:39.140> this<00:00:40.140> here<00:00:40.440> grill

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
propellant and then this here grill

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.450 
propellant and then this here grill
lighter<00:00:41.390> right<00:00:42.390> up<00:00:42.510> there<00:00:43.070> has<00:00:44.070> a<00:00:44.100> wire

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
lighter right up there has a wire

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.760 
lighter right up there has a wire
running<00:00:44.790> down<00:00:45.090> into<00:00:45.450> two<00:00:45.630> screws<00:00:46.020> on<00:00:46.050> top<00:00:46.410> of

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
running down into two screws on top of

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.440 
running down into two screws on top of
the<00:00:46.830> combustion<00:00:47.160> chamber<00:00:47.340> and<00:00:47.850> they<00:00:48.300> are

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
the combustion chamber and they are

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.520 
the combustion chamber and they are
pattern<00:00:49.170> in<00:00:49.350> at<00:00:49.730> angles<00:00:50.730> and<00:00:50.940> a<00:00:51.630> spark<00:00:52.230> jumps

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
pattern in at angles and a spark jumps

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.380 
pattern in at angles and a spark jumps
across<00:00:52.620> them<00:00:53.010> in<00:00:53.130> ignites<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:53.760> hairspray<00:00:54.210> and

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
across them in ignites the hairspray and

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.600 
across them in ignites the hairspray and
then<00:00:54.930> you<00:00:55.230> know<00:00:55.350> you've<00:00:55.530> got<00:00:55.560> your<00:00:55.980> potato<00:00:56.370> in

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
then you know you've got your potato in

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.640 
then you know you've got your potato in
the<00:00:56.700> chamber<00:00:57.150> right<00:00:57.630> about<00:00:57.840> here<00:00:57.900> you<00:00:58.530> know

00:00:58.640 --> 00:00:58.650 
the chamber right about here you know

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:00.140 
the chamber right about here you know
you<00:00:58.710> want<00:00:58.950> to<00:00:59.010> measure<00:00:59.160> your<00:00:59.280> ramrod<00:00:59.579> so<00:00:59.970> goes

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:00.150 
you want to measure your ramrod so goes

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:03.440 
you want to measure your ramrod so goes
about<00:01:00.390> here<00:01:00.600> and<00:01:01.700> that<00:01:02.700> you<00:01:03.120> know<00:01:03.239> that

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:03.450 
about here and that you know that

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:06.770 
about here and that you know that
ignition<00:01:04.079> will<00:01:05.009> send<00:01:05.250> that<00:01:05.430> potato<00:01:05.790> at<00:01:06.479> very

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
ignition will send that potato at very

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:15.620 
ignition will send that potato at very
high<00:01:06.869> velocities<00:01:07.680> quite<00:01:08.430> a<00:01:08.460> distance<00:01:14.630> the

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
high velocities quite a distance the

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:16.940 
high velocities quite a distance the
things<00:01:15.900> I<00:01:16.050> have<00:01:16.200> laid<00:01:16.409> out<00:01:16.440> here<00:01:16.770> are

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
things I have laid out here are

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.740 
things I have laid out here are
obviously<00:01:17.550> the<00:01:18.060> cannon<00:01:18.510> the<00:01:19.260> cap<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:20.310> ramrod

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:20.750 
obviously the cannon the cap the ramrod

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:24.020 
obviously the cannon the cap the ramrod
potatoes<00:01:21.750> for<00:01:21.990> ammunition<00:01:22.820> hairspray<00:01:23.820> for

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
potatoes for ammunition hairspray for

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.170 
potatoes for ammunition hairspray for
fuel<00:01:24.270> and<00:01:24.479> a<00:01:24.810> pipe<00:01:25.020> wrench<00:01:25.250> for<00:01:26.250> when<00:01:26.760> the<00:01:26.940> cap

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
fuel and a pipe wrench for when the cap

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.440 
fuel and a pipe wrench for when the cap
gets<00:01:27.600> stuck<00:01:27.930> from<00:01:28.170> hairspray<00:01:28.440> residue<00:01:29.240> ok<00:01:30.240> now

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
gets stuck from hairspray residue ok now

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:31.610 
gets stuck from hairspray residue ok now
I'm<00:01:30.720> going<00:01:30.780> to<00:01:30.930> show<00:01:31.049> you<00:01:31.110> how<00:01:31.170> to<00:01:31.290> load<00:01:31.440> this

but the scraps fall away take your

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:48.830 
but the scraps fall away take your
ramrod<00:01:44.369> get<00:01:45.369> and<00:01:45.549> smack<00:01:45.970> it<00:01:46.000> down<00:01:46.180> in<00:01:46.539> there<00:01:46.720> a

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
ramrod get and smack it down in there a

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.679 
ramrod get and smack it down in there a
little<00:01:49.840> weird<00:01:50.020> doing<00:01:50.259> it<00:01:50.409> one-handed<00:01:50.619> or<00:01:51.159> a

little weird doing it one-handed or a
one-person<00:01:54.810> once<00:01:55.810> that<00:01:55.990> stamp<00:01:56.320> down<00:01:56.560> you<00:01:56.799> take

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:56.979 
one-person once that stamp down you take

00:01:56.979 --> 00:01:59.370 
one-person once that stamp down you take
your<00:01:57.130> hairspray<00:01:57.750> give<00:01:58.750> her<00:01:58.840> a<00:01:58.899> good<00:01:59.049> charge

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 
your hairspray give her a good charge

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.010 
your hairspray give her a good charge
close<00:01:59.860> it<00:02:00.009> up<00:02:00.130> and<00:02:00.310> then<00:02:00.429> fire<00:02:00.729> it<00:02:00.780> get<00:02:01.780> back<00:02:01.990> to
