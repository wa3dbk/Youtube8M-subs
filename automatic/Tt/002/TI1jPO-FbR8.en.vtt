begin with the cla45 AMG let's go the

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.359 
begin with the cla45 AMG let's go the
first<00:00:31.410> thing<00:00:31.619> you<00:00:31.710> need<00:00:31.800> to<00:00:31.859> know<00:00:31.980> about<00:00:32.040> this

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
first thing you need to know about this

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.250 
first thing you need to know about this
car<00:00:32.579> is<00:00:32.759> it<00:00:32.910> has<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:33.480> most<00:00:33.719> powerful

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
car is it has the most powerful

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.620 
car is it has the most powerful
four-cylinder<00:00:34.770> engine<00:00:35.670> in<00:00:35.880> a<00:00:35.969> production<00:00:36.300> car

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
four-cylinder engine in a production car

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.319 
four-cylinder engine in a production car
worldwide<00:00:37.590> which<00:00:38.309> is<00:00:38.460> probably<00:00:38.790> why<00:00:39.030> I<00:00:39.059> can<00:00:39.270> do

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
worldwide which is probably why I can do

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:43.490 
worldwide which is probably why I can do
a<00:00:39.360> lip-smacking<00:00:40.200> nor<00:00:40.440> 262<00:00:41.190> in<00:00:41.780> 4.6<00:00:42.780> seconds

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:43.500 
a lip-smacking nor 262 in 4.6 seconds

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.500 
a lip-smacking nor 262 in 4.6 seconds
now<00:00:44.190> obviously<00:00:44.340> I<00:00:44.579> can't<00:00:44.910> quite<00:00:45.030> test<00:00:45.360> that

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
now obviously I can't quite test that

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.569 
now obviously I can't quite test that
out<00:00:45.539> on<00:00:45.690> these<00:00:46.079> country<00:00:46.590> roads<00:00:46.620> but<00:00:47.070> I've<00:00:47.399> got

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
out on these country roads but I've got

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.459 
out on these country roads but I've got
a<00:00:47.610> feeling<00:00:47.940> I'm<00:00:48.329> going<00:00:48.780> to<00:00:48.870> be<00:00:48.930> able<00:00:49.050> to<00:00:49.170> put<00:00:49.350> it

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
a feeling I'm going to be able to put it

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:56.029 
a feeling I'm going to be able to put it
to<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.590> test<00:00:49.890> a<00:00:50.280> little<00:00:50.610> bit<00:00:50.730> later<00:00:50.910> on<00:00:51.059> I<00:00:55.039> love

00:00:56.029 --> 00:00:56.039 
to the test a little bit later on I love

00:00:56.039 --> 00:00:57.470 
to the test a little bit later on I love
the<00:00:56.190> look<00:00:56.309> from<00:00:56.399> the<00:00:56.520> rear<00:00:56.730> actually<00:00:57.180> which

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
the look from the rear actually which

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:58.729 
the look from the rear actually which
let's<00:00:57.780> face<00:00:57.870> it<00:00:58.230> that's<00:00:58.350> what<00:00:58.559> most

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
let's face it that's what most

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.380 
let's face it that's what most
bystanders<00:00:59.489> are<00:00:59.550> going<00:00:59.699> to<00:00:59.760> be<00:00:59.850> looking<00:01:00.030> at

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
bystanders are going to be looking at

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.200 
bystanders are going to be looking at
it's<00:01:01.020> almost<00:01:01.320> as<00:01:01.739> if<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.430> designers<00:01:03.059> have

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
it's almost as if the designers have

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.080 
it's almost as if the designers have
hand-carved<00:01:04.170> every<00:01:04.949> piece<00:01:05.280> of<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.519> bodywork

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
hand-carved every piece of the bodywork

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:14.380 
hand-carved every piece of the bodywork
to<00:01:06.659> really<00:01:07.080> enhance<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.830> AMG<00:01:08.310> performance

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:14.390 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.950 

so<00:01:14.960> they<00:01:15.229> have<00:01:15.440> it<00:01:15.560> the<00:01:15.650> cla45<00:01:16.340> AMG<00:01:16.870> but<00:01:17.870> it

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:17.960 
so they have it the cla45 AMG but it

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:19.300 
so they have it the cla45 AMG but it
looks<00:01:18.110> like<00:01:18.200> that's<00:01:18.409> not<00:01:18.680> the<00:01:18.830> only<00:01:18.860> family

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:19.310 
looks like that's not the only family

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.610 
looks like that's not the only family
member<00:01:19.790> that's<00:01:19.909> happy<00:01:20.270> AMG<00:01:20.720> treatment<00:01:21.229> it

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:21.620 
member that's happy AMG treatment it

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:23.440 
member that's happy AMG treatment it
looks<00:01:21.800> like<00:01:21.860> our<00:01:22.070> CLA<00:01:22.550> has<00:01:22.970> got<00:01:23.180> a<00:01:23.210> little

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450 
looks like our CLA has got a little

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:25.540 
looks like our CLA has got a little
brother<00:01:23.900> the<00:01:24.530> sort<00:01:24.800> of<00:01:24.860> little<00:01:25.010> brother<00:01:25.340> that

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:25.550 
brother the sort of little brother that

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:27.040 
brother the sort of little brother that
would<00:01:25.670> be<00:01:25.790> a<00:01:25.820> little<00:01:25.970> bit<00:01:26.150> more<00:01:26.300> mischievious

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:27.050 
would be a little bit more mischievious

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:28.960 
would be a little bit more mischievious
but<00:01:27.680> definitely<00:01:28.100> have<00:01:28.190> been<00:01:28.310> naughty<00:01:28.610> rats

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:28.970 
but definitely have been naughty rats

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:31.270 
but definitely have been naughty rats
school<00:01:29.390> and<00:01:29.659> would<00:01:30.560> almost<00:01:30.770> certainly<00:01:31.070> be

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:31.280 
school and would almost certainly be

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:33.280 
school and would almost certainly be
better<00:01:31.490> at<00:01:31.700> wooing<00:01:31.880> the<00:01:32.090> ladies<00:01:32.240> sort<00:01:33.229> of

better at wooing the ladies sort of
little<00:01:33.440> brother<00:01:33.770> that<00:01:34.009> might<00:01:34.160> be<00:01:34.310> smaller

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:35.290 
little brother that might be smaller

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:42.990 
little brother that might be smaller
definitely<00:01:36.290> make<00:01:36.680> himself<00:01:36.890> hurt

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.000 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:53.640

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.669 

you<00:02:00.850> know<00:02:00.939> everything<00:02:01.600> feels<00:02:01.899> different<00:02:02.079> the

00:02:02.669 --> 00:02:02.679 
you know everything feels different the

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:06.330 
you know everything feels different the
steering<00:02:03.310> feels<00:02:03.869> just<00:02:04.869> so<00:02:05.200> responsive<00:02:06.130> to

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340 
steering feels just so responsive to

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.590 
steering feels just so responsive to
everything

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600 

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.840 

smooth<00:02:11.290> transition<00:02:12.010> with<00:02:12.130> the<00:02:12.250> gears<00:02:12.520> is

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
smooth transition with the gears is

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:22.080 
smooth transition with the gears is
amazing<00:02:14.100> and<00:02:15.100> that<00:02:15.790> noise<00:02:16.170> love<00:02:17.170> it<00:02:20.550> so<00:02:21.550> even

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
amazing and that noise love it so even

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.450 
amazing and that noise love it so even
at<00:02:22.360> speed<00:02:22.810> there's<00:02:23.140> not<00:02:23.380> a<00:02:23.590> lot<00:02:23.950> of<00:02:23.980> under

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:24.460 
at speed there's not a lot of under

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:26.880 
at speed there's not a lot of under
steering<00:02:24.700> or<00:02:24.910> oversteering<00:02:25.600> in<00:02:25.870> fact<00:02:26.140> the<00:02:26.680> car

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
steering or oversteering in fact the car

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:29.730 
steering or oversteering in fact the car
really<00:02:27.490> really<00:02:27.810> sticks<00:02:28.810> to<00:02:29.080> the<00:02:29.200> road<00:02:29.410> and<00:02:29.680> you

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:29.740 
really really sticks to the road and you

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:31.470 
really really sticks to the road and you
feel<00:02:29.920> like<00:02:29.950> you've<00:02:30.220> got<00:02:30.430> full<00:02:30.940> control<00:02:31.150> of

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
feel like you've got full control of

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.330 
feel like you've got full control of
that<00:02:31.750> steering<00:02:32.260> and<00:02:32.620> that's<00:02:33.070> probably

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:33.340 
that steering and that's probably
