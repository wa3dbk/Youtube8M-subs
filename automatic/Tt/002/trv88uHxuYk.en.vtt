I've gotten done pump grip so far so

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.519 
I've gotten done pump grip so far so
here<00:00:12.599> it<00:00:12.690> is<00:00:13.880> it's<00:00:14.880> basically<00:00:15.330> made<00:00:16.230> from<00:00:16.440> a

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
here it is it's basically made from a

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.300 
here it is it's basically made from a
swell<00:00:17.119> two<00:00:18.119> pieces<00:00:18.510> actually<00:00:18.779> of<00:00:19.310> two-inch

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:20.310 
swell two pieces actually of two-inch

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.259 
swell two pieces actually of two-inch
PVC<00:00:20.789> that<00:00:21.359> I<00:00:21.420> heat<00:00:21.689> molded<00:00:22.109> onto<00:00:22.380> the<00:00:23.279> well

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
PVC that I heat molded onto the well

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:25.519 
PVC that I heat molded onto the well
basically<00:00:24.510> I<00:00:24.630> just<00:00:24.750> flatten<00:00:25.140> the<00:00:25.260> whole<00:00:25.350> thing

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.529 
basically I just flatten the whole thing

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:28.519 
basically I just flatten the whole thing
out<00:00:25.619> first<00:00:25.949> and<00:00:26.689> after<00:00:27.689> I<00:00:27.720> made<00:00:27.900> the<00:00:28.019> cuts<00:00:28.230> and

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529 
out first and after I made the cuts and

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:31.790 
out first and after I made the cuts and
then<00:00:28.769> I<00:00:28.890> molded<00:00:29.880> it<00:00:30.359> on<00:00:30.869> to<00:00:31.019> the<00:00:31.140> actual<00:00:31.289> long

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
then I molded it on to the actual long

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.260 
then I molded it on to the actual long
shot<00:00:33.620> and<00:00:34.620> then<00:00:34.860> i<00:00:34.920> made<00:00:35.370> this<00:00:35.579> piece<00:00:35.850> to<00:00:36.120> keep

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
shot and then i made this piece to keep

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.530 
shot and then i made this piece to keep
it<00:00:36.420> from<00:00:36.570> falling<00:00:36.960> down<00:00:37.140> like<00:00:37.620> that<00:00:38.540> because

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:39.540 
it from falling down like that because

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.580 
it from falling down like that because
it<00:00:39.780> otherwise<00:00:40.079> it<00:00:40.200> hinges<00:00:40.590> here<00:00:40.800> and<00:00:41.270> i<00:00:42.590> took

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:43.590 
it otherwise it hinges here and i took

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.580 
it otherwise it hinges here and i took
part<00:00:43.860> of<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.340> top<00:00:45.210> of<00:00:45.360> the<00:00:45.480> front<00:00:45.690> gun<00:00:45.960> the

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:46.590 
part of the top of the front gun the

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:47.930 
part of the top of the front gun the
original<00:00:46.950> front<00:00:47.100> gun<00:00:47.280> from<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:47.489> long<00:00:47.700> shot

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
original front gun from the long shot

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.680 
original front gun from the long shot
and<00:00:48.800> attached<00:00:49.800> it<00:00:49.980> on<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.370> slide<00:00:50.670> it<00:00:51.420> makes<00:00:51.570> a

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
and attached it on the slide it makes a

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.470 
and attached it on the slide it makes a
nice<00:00:51.840> handle<00:00:52.770> and<00:00:53.460> it's<00:00:54.180> still<00:00:54.360> a<00:00:54.420> really

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
nice handle and it's still a really

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.110 
nice handle and it's still a really
heavy<00:00:54.930> prime<00:00:55.289> but<00:00:55.829> it<00:00:56.430> actually<00:00:56.610> worked

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
heavy prime but it actually worked

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:04.609 
heavy prime but it actually worked
pretty<00:00:57.270> well<00:00:59.300> so<00:01:02.539> i'm<00:01:03.539> pretty<00:01:04.140> happy<00:01:04.320> with<00:01:04.559> it

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
pretty well so i'm pretty happy with it

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.969 
pretty well so i'm pretty happy with it
this<00:01:05.580> epoxy<00:01:05.939> buddy<00:01:06.270> is<00:01:06.420> still<00:01:06.689> curing<00:01:07.380> as<00:01:07.680> we

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
this epoxy buddy is still curing as we

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:13.490 
this epoxy buddy is still curing as we
speak<00:01:08.250> actually<00:01:09.049> but<00:01:10.049> after<00:01:10.950> that<00:01:12.049> all<00:01:13.049> I<00:01:13.140> will

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
speak actually but after that all I will

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.670 
speak actually but after that all I will
have<00:01:13.710> left<00:01:14.010> is<00:01:14.369> some<00:01:14.729> fine-tuning<00:01:15.030> and<00:01:15.570> a<00:01:16.470> bit

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680

have left is some fine-tuning and a bit
of<00:01:16.710> well<00:01:17.369> a<00:01:17.729> bit<00:01:18.720> of<00:01:18.810> fine-tuning<00:01:19.020> and<00:01:19.350> the

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
of well a bit of fine-tuning and the

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.160 
of well a bit of fine-tuning and the
paint<00:01:19.740> job<00:01:19.950> itself<00:01:20.280> and<00:01:20.840> I'm<00:01:21.840> going<00:01:22.020> to<00:01:22.080> be

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.340 
putting some copper plates on the sides
which<00:01:27.450> I'm<00:01:27.630> going<00:01:27.869> to<00:01:28.430> cut<00:01:29.430> and<00:01:30.110> finish<00:01:31.110> and

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:31.350

which I'm going to cut and finish and
detail<00:01:31.680> myself<00:01:32.189> so<00:01:33.119> because<00:01:33.930> I'm<00:01:34.049> a<00:01:34.110> middles

and<00:01:34.439> jewelry<00:01:34.740> major<00:01:34.920> here<00:01:35.159> at<00:01:35.189> scad<00:01:35.490> so<00:01:35.700> I

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
and jewelry major here at scad so I

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.560 
and jewelry major here at scad so I
might<00:01:35.880> as<00:01:35.939> well<00:01:36.060> do<00:01:36.299> some<00:01:36.479> stuff<00:01:36.720> with<00:01:36.750> middle

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:38.570 
might as well do some stuff with middle

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.649 
might as well do some stuff with middle
but<00:01:39.570> yeah<00:01:40.700> as<00:01:41.700> I<00:01:41.850> said<00:01:42.000> this<00:01:42.119> doesn't<00:01:42.479> find

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
but yeah as I said this doesn't find

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:46.249 
but yeah as I said this doesn't find
going<00:01:42.840> to<00:01:42.960> do<00:01:43.079> like<00:01:43.700> sometimes<00:01:44.700> the<00:01:45.259> darts

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
going to do like sometimes the darts

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:51.289 
going to do like sometimes the darts
won't<00:01:47.210> feed<00:01:48.210> completely<00:01:49.049> up<00:01:49.799> into<00:01:50.159> the<00:01:50.310> breach

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
won't feed completely up into the breach

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.080 
won't feed completely up into the breach
that<00:01:51.329> I've<00:01:51.630> made

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:54.090 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:56.840 

but<00:01:54.890> that<00:01:55.890> just<00:01:55.920> takes<00:01:56.130> a<00:01:56.340> bit<00:01:56.369> of<00:01:56.490> jiggling

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
but that just takes a bit of jiggling

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.429 
but that just takes a bit of jiggling
with<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.149> slide<00:01:57.390> so<00:01:57.750> it<00:01:58.939> still<00:01:59.939> works<00:02:00.439> fairly

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
with the slide so it still works fairly

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:11.440 
with the slide so it still works fairly
well<00:02:02.990> yeah<00:02:03.990> like<00:02:04.350> that<00:02:04.590> and<00:02:05.399> there's<00:02:07.009> in<00:02:08.009> there

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:11.450 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:21.970 

it's<00:02:12.450> not<00:02:12.660> quite<00:02:12.930> fit<00:02:14.209> and<00:02:15.209> now<00:02:16.220> there<00:02:17.220> we<00:02:17.340> go

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:21.980 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.180 

and<00:02:22.980> yeah<00:02:23.129> and<00:02:23.549> I've<00:02:24.330> fixed<00:02:24.650> the<00:02:25.650> front<00:02:26.010> gun

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
and yeah and I've fixed the front gun

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.850 
and yeah and I've fixed the front gun
trigger<00:02:26.519> was<00:02:26.910> messing<00:02:27.269> up<00:02:27.390> so<00:02:27.690> I<00:02:27.930> decided<00:02:28.769> to

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
trigger was messing up so I decided to

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.979 
trigger was messing up so I decided to
fix<00:02:29.040> that<00:02:29.280> when<00:02:29.549> I<00:02:29.610> went<00:02:29.849> in<00:02:30.030> to<00:02:30.060> do<00:02:30.690> some<00:02:30.720> other

00:02:30.979 --> 00:02:30.989 
fix that when I went in to do some other

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:34.490 
fix that when I went in to do some other
stuff<00:02:31.110> so<00:02:32.450> hopefully<00:02:33.450> the<00:02:33.989> next<00:02:34.049> time<00:02:34.349> I'll

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
stuff so hopefully the next time I'll

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.500 
stuff so hopefully the next time I'll
make<00:02:34.620> a<00:02:34.650> video<00:02:34.799> about<00:02:35.069> this<00:02:35.430> it<00:02:36.150> will<00:02:36.239> they<00:02:36.329> be

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510
