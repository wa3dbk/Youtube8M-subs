00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
never used this before I read the

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:33.410 
never used this before I read the
instructions<00:00:31.050> so<00:00:31.230> let's<00:00:31.439> see<00:00:32.000> how<00:00:33.000> easy<00:00:33.210> it

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
instructions so let's see how easy it

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.600 
instructions so let's see how easy it
really<00:00:33.480> is<00:00:33.950> because<00:00:34.950> if<00:00:35.070> I<00:00:35.190> can<00:00:35.370> do<00:00:35.460> this

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:35.610 
really is because if I can do this

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:40.760 
really is because if I can do this
without<00:00:38.420> just<00:00:39.420> read<00:00:39.660> that<00:00:39.870> manual<00:00:40.050> once<00:00:40.469> then

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:40.770 
without just read that manual once then

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:46.729 
without just read that manual once then
you<00:00:40.920> should<00:00:41.129> be<00:00:41.250> able<00:00:41.309> to<00:00:41.750> do<00:00:42.750> it<00:00:42.870> fine<00:00:43.140> so<00:00:45.739> this

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
you should be able to do it fine so this

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:48.799 
you should be able to do it fine so this
is<00:00:46.890> he<00:00:46.980> turned<00:00:47.280> off<00:00:47.430> turn<00:00:48.180> off<00:00:48.300> or<00:00:48.480> not<00:00:48.600> but

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:48.809 
is he turned off turn off or not but

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.250 
is he turned off turn off or not but
right<00:00:49.260> here's<00:00:49.469> something<00:00:49.770> if<00:00:49.860> it's<00:00:49.980> not<00:00:51.260> now

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
right here's something if it's not now

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:53.869 
right here's something if it's not now
it's<00:00:52.379> okay<00:00:52.620> to<00:00:52.680> do<00:00:52.829> this<00:00:52.980> inside<00:00:53.340> only<00:00:53.699> if<00:00:53.789> you

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
it's okay to do this inside only if you

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.720 
it's okay to do this inside only if you
keep<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.590> some<00:00:55.590> ventilation<00:00:55.829> going<00:00:56.309> like<00:00:56.489> I

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
keep the some ventilation going like I

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.660
