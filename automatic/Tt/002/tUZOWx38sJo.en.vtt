00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:07.489 
breakthroughs that we had early on is

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:09.160 
breakthroughs that we had early on is
that<00:03:07.730> we<00:03:07.820> came<00:03:08.000> up<00:03:08.060> with<00:03:08.299> a<00:03:08.330> special<00:03:08.810> stainless

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:09.170 
that we came up with a special stainless

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:12.100 
that we came up with a special stainless
steel<00:03:09.380> that<00:03:09.739> is<00:03:09.890> horrible<00:03:10.870> food<00:03:11.870> safe

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:12.110

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:15.530 
horrible this particular one is horrible

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:17.620 
horrible this particular one is horrible
and<00:03:15.680> we<00:03:15.769> use<00:03:16.489> in<00:03:16.640> our<00:03:16.700> blade<00:03:17.030> so<00:03:17.209> that<00:03:17.269> gives<00:03:17.510> us

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:17.630 
and we use in our blade so that gives us

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:19.930 
and we use in our blade so that gives us
a<00:03:17.780> tough<00:03:17.989> material<00:03:18.560> it<00:03:18.950> also<00:03:19.340> means<00:03:19.640> that<00:03:19.760> the

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
a tough material it also means that the

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:21.640 
a tough material it also means that the
edges<00:03:20.269> are<00:03:20.360> not<00:03:20.540> going<00:03:20.690> to<00:03:20.780> wear<00:03:20.959> any<00:03:21.410> road

nearly as fast as here with otherwise it

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:24.850 
nearly as fast as here with otherwise it
means<00:03:23.780> that<00:03:23.959> we<00:03:23.989> can<00:03:24.200> keep<00:03:24.350> the<00:03:24.530> thickness

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:24.860

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:12.840 
we compared the Vitamix processed fruits

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.569 
we compared the Vitamix processed fruits
and<00:04:13.049> vegetables<00:04:13.469> to<00:04:13.859> the<00:04:13.950> same<00:04:14.159> foods<00:04:14.489> that

and vegetables to the same foods that

00:04:14.579 --> 00:04:16.310 
and vegetables to the same foods that
have<00:04:14.670> been<00:04:14.819> chewed<00:04:15.120> our<00:04:15.780> research<00:04:16.289> indicates

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
have been chewed our research indicates

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.219 
have been chewed our research indicates
that<00:04:16.889> the<00:04:17.070> Vitamix<00:04:17.609> blended<00:04:18.030> particle<00:04:19.019> size

00:04:19.219 --> 00:04:19.229 
that the Vitamix blended particle size

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:23.600 
that the Vitamix blended particle size
is<00:04:20.190> decreased<00:04:20.789> by<00:04:20.970> but<00:04:21.209> ten<00:04:21.479> tenfold<00:04:22.400> now<00:04:23.400> what

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
is decreased by but ten tenfold now what

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:26.060 
is decreased by but ten tenfold now what
this<00:04:23.789> means<00:04:24.090> is<00:04:24.570> that<00:04:24.600> the<00:04:25.350> particle<00:04:25.860> size

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
this means is that the particle size

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:28.790 
this means is that the particle size
reduced<00:04:26.990> actually<00:04:27.990> increases<00:04:28.530> the<00:04:28.530> surface

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:28.800 
reduced actually increases the surface

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.760 
reduced actually increases the surface

00:04:33.499 --> 00:04:33.509 
should be able to absorb more nutrients

00:04:33.509 --> 00:04:36.290 
should be able to absorb more nutrients
from<00:04:33.810> that<00:04:34.080> food<00:04:34.400> now<00:04:35.400> because<00:04:35.759> of<00:04:35.789> the

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
from that food now because of the

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.480 
from that food now because of the
decrease<00:04:36.810> in<00:04:36.990> particle<00:04:37.380> size<00:04:37.590> and<00:04:38.039> the<00:04:38.250> ease

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:38.490 
decrease in particle size and the ease
