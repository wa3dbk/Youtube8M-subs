00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:10.870 
time and if it does break or get yellow
to<00:04:07.190> death<00:04:07.400> again<00:04:07.670> then<00:04:08.860> redo<00:04:09.860> it<00:04:09.980> you<00:04:10.519> know<00:04:10.610> I

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:10.880 
to death again then redo it you know I

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:12.850 
to death again then redo it you know I
mean<00:04:11.390> it<00:04:11.480> only<00:04:11.540> takes<00:04:11.870> about<00:04:11.959> ten<00:04:12.260> minutes<00:04:12.290> and

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:12.860 
mean it only takes about ten minutes and

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:16.719 
mean it only takes about ten minutes and
let's<00:04:13.190> go<00:04:13.310> through<00:04:13.489> everything<00:04:13.519> again<00:04:15.729> unplug

00:04:16.719 --> 00:04:16.729 
let's go through everything again unplug

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:19.690 
let's go through everything again unplug
everything<00:04:17.019> you<00:04:18.019> take<00:04:18.979> the<00:04:19.100> blow<00:04:19.280> dry<00:04:19.489> to<00:04:19.549> do

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:19.700 
everything you take the blow dry to do

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.360 
everything you take the blow dry to do
it<00:04:19.850> three<00:04:20.450> and<00:04:20.479> a<00:04:20.870> half<00:04:21.079> inches<00:04:21.620> and<00:04:21.680> just<00:04:22.250> go

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:22.370 
it three and a half inches and just go

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:24.129 
it three and a half inches and just go
back<00:04:22.400> and<00:04:22.790> forth<00:04:23.000> along<00:04:23.150> those<00:04:23.419> back<00:04:23.690> events

00:04:24.129 --> 00:04:24.139 
back and forth along those back events

00:04:24.139 --> 00:04:26.020 
back and forth along those back events
doesn't<00:04:24.770> matter<00:04:24.979> if<00:04:25.130> you<00:04:25.220> stand<00:04:25.490> it<00:04:25.610> up<00:04:25.729> and<00:04:25.910> do

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:26.030 
doesn't matter if you stand it up and do

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:28.650 
doesn't matter if you stand it up and do
it<00:04:26.060> like<00:04:26.330> that<00:04:26.540> or<00:04:27.050> if<00:04:27.770> you<00:04:27.889> have<00:04:28.040> it<00:04:28.160> sideways

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:28.660 
it like that or if you have it sideways

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:33.940 
it like that or if you have it sideways
you<00:04:29.660> know<00:04:29.770> and<00:04:30.770> you<00:04:30.979> just<00:04:31.870> you<00:04:32.870> know<00:04:32.950> slowly

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:33.950 
you know and you just you know slowly

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:38.670 
you know and you just you know slowly
slow<00:04:34.610> motion<00:04:35.800> and<00:04:36.800> then<00:04:37.190> after<00:04:37.460> that<00:04:37.610> then<00:04:38.120> you

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:38.680 
slow motion and then after that then you

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.050 
slow motion and then after that then you
immediately<00:04:39.680> put<00:04:40.010> that<00:04:40.160> fan<00:04:40.400> right<00:04:40.729> on<00:04:40.910> the

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:41.060 
immediately put that fan right on the

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:44.409 
immediately put that fan right on the
back<00:04:41.240> events<00:04:41.750> of<00:04:41.870> it<00:04:42.020> and<00:04:43.300> everything<00:04:44.300> should

00:04:44.409 --> 00:04:44.419 
back events of it and everything should

00:04:44.419 --> 00:04:46.500 
back events of it and everything should
be<00:04:44.479> good<00:04:44.690> to<00:04:45.650> go

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:46.510 
be good to go

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:49.420 
be good to go
you<00:04:47.510> you<00:04:48.050> fan<00:04:48.289> it<00:04:48.410> for<00:04:48.500> about<00:04:48.590> ten<00:04:48.890> minutes<00:04:49.039> and

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:49.430 
you you fan it for about ten minutes and

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:55.270 
you you fan it for about ten minutes and
you<00:04:50.270> yeah<00:04:51.010> and<00:04:53.620> you<00:04:54.620> fan<00:04:54.800> for<00:04:54.950> about<00:04:55.010> 10

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:55.280 
you yeah and you fan for about 10

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:57.240 
you yeah and you fan for about 10
minutes<00:04:55.430> after<00:04:55.700> you<00:04:56.150> blow<00:04:56.390> dry<00:04:56.600> it<00:04:56.720> for<00:04:57.110> about

00:04:57.240 --> 00:04:57.250 
minutes after you blow dry it for about

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:59.320 
minutes after you blow dry it for about
five<00:04:58.250> to<00:04:58.520> seven<00:04:58.760> minutes

00:04:59.320 --> 00:04:59.330 
five to seven minutes

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:01.360 
five to seven minutes
I'd<00:04:59.660> go<00:04:59.990> seven<00:05:00.440> just<00:05:00.650> to<00:05:00.740> make<00:05:00.890> sure<00:05:00.919> but<00:05:01.280> you

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:01.370 
I'd go seven just to make sure but you

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:02.409 
I'd go seven just to make sure but you
don't<00:05:01.400> want<00:05:01.610> to<00:05:01.669> put<00:05:01.789> it<00:05:01.850> too<00:05:01.970> close<00:05:02.000> because

00:05:02.409 --> 00:05:02.419 
don't want to put it too close because

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:05.230 
don't want to put it too close because
it<00:05:02.510> might<00:05:02.720> melt<00:05:02.900> the<00:05:03.200> bag<00:05:03.860> vents<00:05:04.220> um<00:05:04.490> just<00:05:05.150> to

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:05.240 
it might melt the bag vents um just to

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:06.730 
it might melt the bag vents um just to
prove<00:05:05.419> that<00:05:05.479> my<00:05:05.720> playstation<00:05:06.080> is<00:05:06.320> working

00:05:06.730 --> 00:05:06.740 
prove that my playstation is working

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:15.010 
prove that my playstation is working
what's<00:05:07.010> such

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:15.020 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:20.350 

this<00:05:16.020> keep<00:05:16.380> hot<00:05:17.310> they're<00:05:17.490> out<00:05:17.730> um<00:05:18.030> and<00:05:18.930> it<00:05:19.920> just

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:20.360 
this keep hot they're out um and it just

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:23.030 
this keep hot they're out um and it just
because<00:05:21.360> the<00:05:21.540> problem<00:05:21.990> is<00:05:22.110> with<00:05:22.440> yellow<00:05:22.770> death

00:05:23.030 --> 00:05:23.040 
because the problem is with yellow death

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:26.390 
because the problem is with yellow death
it<00:05:23.540> the<00:05:24.540> solder<00:05:24.840> on<00:05:25.140> the<00:05:25.230> inside<00:05:25.590> you<00:05:26.160> Chad

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:26.400 
it the solder on the inside you Chad

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.970 
it the solder on the inside you Chad
detaches<00:05:27.180> because<00:05:27.390> it<00:05:27.540> when<00:05:28.260> it<00:05:28.380> gets<00:05:28.560> hot<00:05:28.770> it

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:28.980 
detaches because it when it gets hot it

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:31.610 
detaches because it when it gets hot it
spreads<00:05:29.850> apart<00:05:30.000> and<00:05:30.420> then<00:05:30.510> it<00:05:30.660> slowly<00:05:31.140> cools

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:31.620 
spreads apart and then it slowly cools

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:34.190 
spreads apart and then it slowly cools
and<00:05:31.980> it<00:05:32.070> keeps<00:05:32.820> on<00:05:32.970> doing<00:05:33.150> that<00:05:33.420> process<00:05:33.660> and

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:34.200 
and it keeps on doing that process and

00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:37.300 
and it keeps on doing that process and
then<00:05:34.290> it<00:05:34.440> just<00:05:34.680> gets<00:05:34.920> kind<00:05:35.520> of<00:05:35.720> torn<00:05:36.720> away<00:05:36.840> from

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:37.310 
then it just gets kind of torn away from

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:40.370 
then it just gets kind of torn away from
whatever<00:05:38.310> it<00:05:38.550> is<00:05:38.640> it<00:05:38.850> gets<00:05:38.970> torn<00:05:39.300> away<00:05:39.360> from<00:05:39.690> so

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:40.380 
whatever it is it gets torn away from so

00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:42.050 
whatever it is it gets torn away from so
if<00:05:40.530> you<00:05:40.650> quickly<00:05:40.920> cool<00:05:41.280> it<00:05:41.430> won't<00:05:41.700> do<00:05:41.850> that<00:05:42.000> and

00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:42.060 
if you quickly cool it won't do that and

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:44.840 
if you quickly cool it won't do that and
you<00:05:42.630> just<00:05:42.780> keep<00:05:42.960> fan<00:05:43.230> on<00:05:43.380> it<00:05:43.560> so<00:05:43.770> that's<00:05:44.670> what<00:05:44.790> I

00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:44.850 
you just keep fan on it so that's what I

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:45.230 
you just keep fan on it so that's what I
do

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:45.240 
do

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:47.660 
do
