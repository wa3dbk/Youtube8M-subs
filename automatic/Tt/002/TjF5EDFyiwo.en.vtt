00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:15.929
 different and that's exactly what they 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.520
 everyone was safe today 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.920
 have ever eaten bread in their life 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.869
 French but maybe consumed a bread 

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:24.210
 delicious trans french like the one that 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.279
 I will teach how to prepare fear 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.410
 this is a bread and good is a little more 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.539
 complicated that is normal that we know 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.340
 but the healing is worth going to 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:35.219
 make more decision before 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.719
 yes if you are not going to regret they have to 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.059
 work they have to do it really 

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.989
 promise me they're going to do it all 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:41.989
 prepare 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:51.449
 we all need home and in fact 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.460
 also if they have bread that is already like 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:55.680
 This recipe is perfect for 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.230
 rescue this bread what we are going to do 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.960
 is to split the bread into strips like this or 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.430
 less and so we're going to start all our 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.260
 bread in pieces and we will go 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.710
 placing in a mold that can be put 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.710
 baked 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:13.409
 vanilla essence the other eggs and 

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:15.659
 90 grams of butter 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:18.859
 let's beat the eggs and we're going to 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:18.859
 mix with vanilla essence 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:24.550
 then we are going to add the butter 

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.550
 but melted 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:29.590
 and we are going to empty this mixture on top of the 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.600
 bread you have to try to make everything 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:34.909
 full of this mixture did not come out to me 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.530

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:38.960
 let's put the cheese in a bowl 

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:41.780
 philadelphia hot water and a 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:45.150
 little bit of milk we are going to beat it and 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:47.700
 then we will use icing sugar 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:50.580
 sugar is to taste can be tasting 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.380

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.910
 until it has the flavor that you 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.010
 they like it if they like very sweet you 

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:58.310
 can put more sugar or if not then not 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:58.310

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:01.830
 Y 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.170

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.209
 sachet of preference of these sachets 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:17.630
