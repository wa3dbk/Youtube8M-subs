00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.809
 Well, this video is more than anything 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.210
 so special because let's say it's going to 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:16.890
 be the formal farewell to this little game 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:18.690
 to this project to the call of duty black 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.350
 ops' this video is a type of activity 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.090
 formal 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:23.070
 I'm going to put sentimental gentlemen so 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:27.180

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.470
 formal this game why because this 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.210
 game for me means a lot means 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.059
 much more than a simple game means 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.110
 much more than a simple one is how it 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:38.940
 condition simple in the middle of 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.230
 entertainment for me not just a 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.329
 videogame but it is a videogame very 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.520
 special because thanks to this thanks to 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:47.610
 this fucking disc or blood is to this 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:50.160
 I got several things starting more than 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:52.710
 nothing good and then my channel came out 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.989
 thanks to this game today I am what 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.640
 that I am in on youtube today I am 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.260
 uber güicho in this game and obviously 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:59.640
 thanks to you then but this 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.070
 game if it were not for this game I do not 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:03.460
 I would have made my channel 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.979
 so then 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:09.430
 my xbox I actually bought it for this 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:10.659
 I play most of my time 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.540
 spend in this game and I'm 

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:15.130
 completely happy about that, that is, not me 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.509
 regret of no mames I have so many 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.040
 losses in this game no no no to 

00:01:16.509 --> 00:01:19.659
 opposite because I tell them mirror 

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:22.060
 means a lot to me from the day that 

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:24.430
 buy my xbox remember the day 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.810
 next I said I'm going for my black ops was 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:28.420
 in mid-December more or less 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.610
 then I already had a month like 

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:32.050
 get out of the game then I was just do 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.759
 implants I was not walking from my house 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:35.140
 I did about 20 minutes but it was not worth 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:37.330
 cock because he could not take me then 

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.550
 I had to get my black ops and 

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:41.110
 I went as I was alone in that implant I do not know 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:43.720
 why the fuck nothing else to me 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:45.729
 they did fart why on earth 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.649
 because this is supposed to be m not me 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:48.759
 they wanted to sell it and I told myself no, it's not 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:50.229
 that you are a minor and you can not 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:52.240
 sell the game not because your mother in 

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:53.289
 vinegar and the talk my mom choose mom 

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.240
 these glasses do not want to sell me the 

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:57.880
 game already talked to them and they have finally 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.530
 gave me in the game this from that day 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.929
 since I do not know what will have been 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.280
 December hours and hours and hours playing 

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:05.020
 this guy pin doing bullshit with 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.210
 my friends revealing me until the 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.440
 four or five in the morning playing 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.390
 multiplayer 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:13.330
 playing for hours and hours and hours 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.650
 zombies after this I already knew 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.480
 syndicate I started watching gameplays from 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.090
 zombies and I said good why not do a 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:22.840
 channel involving zombies and gas this 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:24.820
 game was that I started my channel this 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.220
 something else besides this game for me is 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:28.900
 somewhat special because it is also the 

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:31.660
 only player who bought all the 

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:33.280

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.440
 drawer in which I have all the achievements 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.540
