open<00:02:10.819> ones<00:02:11.030> we're<00:02:11.540> gonna<00:02:11.660> aim<00:02:11.930> for<00:02:12.230> that<00:02:12.410> we're

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
open ones we're gonna aim for that we're

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:15.280 
open ones we're gonna aim for that we're
gonna<00:02:13.040> jump<00:02:13.459> July<00:02:14.060> boost<00:02:14.599> and<00:02:14.870> then<00:02:14.959> pull<00:02:15.170> back

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
gonna jump July boost and then pull back

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.070 
gonna jump July boost and then pull back
so<00:02:15.709> this<00:02:16.040> one<00:02:16.280> the<00:02:16.730> one<00:02:16.910> Derek<00:02:17.330> I<00:02:17.540> guess<00:02:17.959> I'll

just follow you we're pulling back okay

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.580 
just follow you we're pulling back okay
yes<00:02:22.640> yes<00:02:23.450> pull<00:02:23.690> back<00:02:23.870> what's<00:02:24.230> the<00:02:24.349> reason<00:02:24.560> for

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:24.590

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
pulling back see it's a further distance

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:28.750 
pulling back see it's a further distance
without<00:02:27.830> going<00:02:28.160> down

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760
