this is really to focus on how of a

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.470 
this is really to focus on how of a
driver<00:00:23.369> should<00:00:23.670> be<00:00:23.789> safe<00:00:24.029> while<00:00:24.300> they're

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:15.510 
this or a good thing because it really

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:17.630 
this or a good thing because it really
first<00:01:16.140> of<00:01:16.229> all<00:01:16.320> it<00:01:16.530> gives<00:01:16.650> members<00:01:17.369> a<00:01:17.400> chance

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
I think I have six or seven of them on

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.170 
I think I have six or seven of them on
my<00:01:42.390> farm<00:01:42.690> at<00:01:42.869> home<00:01:43.080> I'm<00:01:43.440> the<00:01:43.500> oldest<00:01:44.190> of<00:01:44.430> three

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
my farm at home I'm the oldest of three

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.540 
my farm at home I'm the oldest of three
of<00:01:45.899> two<00:01:46.649> brothers<00:01:46.830> I<00:01:47.130> have<00:01:47.190> two<00:01:47.369> younger

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:47.550 
of two brothers I have two younger

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:49.850 
of two brothers I have two younger
brothers<00:01:47.759> and<00:01:48.240> I<00:01:48.479> don't<00:01:49.259> usually<00:01:49.410> let<00:01:49.710> them

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
brothers and I don't usually let them

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.800 
brothers and I don't usually let them
try<00:01:50.100> to<00:01:50.130> tractor<00:01:50.700> because<00:01:50.910> I<00:01:51.119> can<00:01:51.360> do<00:01:51.450> it<00:01:51.570> a<00:01:51.600> lot

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
try to tractor because I can do it a lot

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.690 
try to tractor because I can do it a lot
quicker<00:01:51.990> so<00:01:52.259> I<00:01:52.530> guess<00:01:52.800> they<00:01:52.950> get<00:01:53.130> a<00:01:53.340> lot<00:01:53.490> more

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
quicker so I guess they get a lot more

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.600 
quicker so I guess they get a lot more
practice<00:01:53.940> than<00:01:54.270> what<00:01:54.390> they<00:01:54.539> do
