00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.240
 the door in the sheep fold but 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:08.710
 that goes up on the other hand 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.390
 that is a thief 

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:13.760
 and robber 

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:16.049
 but the one who enters through the door is the 

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:18.869
 shepherd of the sheep 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.480
 to this opens the doorman and the sheep hear 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.640
 his voice 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:26.250
 and his sheep called by name 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.619
 and take it out 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.470
 and when he pulls all his own goes 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:35.210
 in front of them and the sheep follow 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:35.210
 because they know his voice 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:42.280
 but the stranger will not follow 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:44.490
 more will go up because they do not know their 

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.490
 voice 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:50.730
 Of certain truth I tell you I am the 

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:52.470
 sheep door 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.260
 who came before me were 

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:58.190
 More thieves and robbers did not hear them 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.190
 the sheep 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:05.790
 I am the door 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:10.170
 whoever I enter will be saved 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:13.390
 and go in and out and find pasture the 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:15.430
 thief does not come but to adopt 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:18.450
 and kill 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:18.450
 and destroy 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:26.240
 I have come for you to have life 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.240
 and so that they have it in abundance 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:34.560
 I am the good shepherd 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:37.079
 the good shepherd gives his life for the sheep 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.380
 but the salaried employee and who is not the pastor 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:45.230
 who they do not own the sheep must 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:47.420
 go to the wolf and leave the sheep and run away 

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:50.150
 and the wolf snatches and scatters the 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:52.430
 sheep so the salaried man flees because 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:54.850
 is a salaried worker and does not care about 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:54.850
 sheep 

00:01:54.909 --> 00:02:03.150
 I am the good shepherd 

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:03.150
 and I know my sheep well and they know me 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:08.869
 just as the father knows me and I know 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:11.320
 to the father and I put my own life for the 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:11.320
 sheep 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:16.090
 and I have other sheep that are not from this 

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.090
 fold 

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:20.500
 to those I must also bring and they will hear my 

00:02:19.109 --> 00:02:24.050
 voice 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:27.110
 and there will be a flock 

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:29.900
 and a shepherd 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:34.990
 that's why the father calls me because I 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:34.990
 I put my life to take it again 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:41.900
 no man 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.900
 it takes my life 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:50.200
 but I put it on myself 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:53.220
 I have power to put it and I have power 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:53.220
 to take it again 

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:01.310
 this commandment I received from my father
