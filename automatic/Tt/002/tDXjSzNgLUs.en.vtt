00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:04.110 
I just wanted to do a video on some of

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:05.749 
I just wanted to do a video on some of
the<00:00:04.170> stuff<00:00:04.440> that<00:00:04.470> we<00:00:04.740> use<00:00:04.980> in<00:00:05.279> our<00:00:05.370> Escrima

00:00:05.749 --> 00:00:05.759 
the stuff that we use in our Escrima

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.669 
the stuff that we use in our Escrima
class<00:00:07.099> basically<00:00:08.099> these<00:00:08.220> are<00:00:08.429> just<00:00:08.610> some

00:00:09.669 --> 00:00:09.679 
class basically these are just some

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:13.640 
class basically these are just some
impact<00:00:10.679> weapons<00:00:11.040> or<00:00:11.309> striking<00:00:11.910> weapons<00:00:12.650> some

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
impact weapons or striking weapons some

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.049 
impact weapons or striking weapons some
of<00:00:13.740> the<00:00:13.830> techniques<00:00:14.250> are<00:00:14.519> pretty<00:00:14.820> much

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
of the techniques are pretty much

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:17.090 
of the techniques are pretty much
universal<00:00:15.690> and<00:00:15.900> the<00:00:16.199> only<00:00:16.710> thing<00:00:16.920> that

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
universal and the only thing that

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.400 
universal and the only thing that
changes<00:00:17.520> is<00:00:17.720> you<00:00:18.720> know<00:00:18.810> what<00:00:19.020> you<00:00:19.170> use<00:00:19.380> to

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410 
changes is you know what you use to

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:25.870 
changes is you know what you use to
strike<00:00:20.220> with<00:00:21.830> first<00:00:22.830> off<00:00:23.660> this<00:00:24.660> one<00:00:24.960> is<00:00:25.199> a

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:25.880 
strike with first off this one is a

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:29.210 
strike with first off this one is a
travel<00:00:26.880> wrench<00:00:27.109> it's<00:00:28.109> made<00:00:28.320> by<00:00:28.500> Kelly<00:00:28.830> warden

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
travel wrench it's made by Kelly warden

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.580 
travel wrench it's made by Kelly warden
quite<00:00:29.609> designed<00:00:29.970> by<00:00:30.119> Kelly<00:00:30.330> warden<00:00:30.689> it's<00:00:31.470> a

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
quite designed by Kelly warden it's a

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.830 
quite designed by Kelly warden it's a
polymer<00:00:31.949> and<00:00:32.250> it<00:00:33.090> looks<00:00:33.270> kind<00:00:33.450> of<00:00:33.480> funky<00:00:33.690> but

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:33.840 
polymer and it looks kind of funky but

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.229 
polymer and it looks kind of funky but
the<00:00:34.739> way<00:00:34.860> that<00:00:35.010> it's<00:00:35.160> designed<00:00:35.309> it's<00:00:35.790> sort<00:00:36.180> of

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:36.239 
the way that it's designed it's sort of

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.569 
the way that it's designed it's sort of
like<00:00:36.329> a<00:00:36.360> car<00:00:36.630> um<00:00:36.780> bit<00:00:37.100> and<00:00:38.100> you<00:00:38.219> can<00:00:38.309> use<00:00:38.460> the

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
like a car um bit and you can use the

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.270 
like a car um bit and you can use the
same<00:00:38.730> techniques<00:00:39.180> but<00:00:39.770> you<00:00:40.770> know<00:00:40.860> it's<00:00:41.040> a<00:00:41.129> good

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
same techniques but you know it's a good

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.060 
same techniques but you know it's a good
striking<00:00:42.059> weapon<00:00:42.390> uh<00:00:42.680> you<00:00:43.680> know<00:00:43.800> if<00:00:43.920> you're

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
striking weapon uh you know if you're

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.430 
striking weapon uh you know if you're
just<00:00:44.309> striking<00:00:44.910> the<00:00:45.210> radial<00:00:46.020> nerve<00:00:46.200> of

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:46.440 
just striking the radial nerve of

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.299 
just striking the radial nerve of
somebody's<00:00:46.950> forearm<00:00:48.559> if<00:00:49.559> you<00:00:49.739> you<00:00:50.039> can<00:00:50.160> use

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
somebody's forearm if you you can use

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.490 
somebody's forearm if you you can use
regular<00:00:50.910> boxing<00:00:51.510> techniques<00:00:51.870> for<00:00:52.110> this<00:00:54.500> you

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
regular boxing techniques for this you

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:01.310 
regular boxing techniques for this you
know<00:00:55.590> it'll<00:00:59.090> it'll<00:01:00.090> intensify<00:01:00.780> any<00:01:01.079> of<00:01:01.199> the

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
know it'll it'll intensify any of the

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.189 
know it'll it'll intensify any of the
strikes<00:01:01.649> that<00:01:01.739> you<00:01:01.980> use<00:01:02.719> the<00:01:03.719> one<00:01:03.870> thing<00:01:04.049> is

00:01:04.189 --> 00:01:04.199 
strikes that you use the one thing is

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.130 
strikes that you use the one thing is
you<00:01:04.439> can<00:01:04.589> also<00:01:04.739> use<00:01:04.949> this<00:01:05.100> as<00:01:05.250> a<00:01:05.280> saber<00:01:05.580> grip

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.140 
you can also use this as a saber grip

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:10.520 
you can also use this as a saber grip
and<00:01:07.140> actually<00:01:07.830> jab<00:01:08.070> someone<00:01:08.520> and<00:01:09.110> the<00:01:10.110> ring<00:01:10.320> is

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
and actually jab someone and the ring is

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.600 
and actually jab someone and the ring is
pretty<00:01:10.920> solid<00:01:11.189> so<00:01:11.610> it's<00:01:12.600> a<00:01:12.689> pretty<00:01:12.869> good

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:13.610 
pretty solid so it's a pretty good

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.340 
pretty solid so it's a pretty good
self-defense<00:01:14.610> tool<00:01:14.880> and<00:01:15.509> it<00:01:15.840> also<00:01:16.049> is<00:01:16.320> a

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
self-defense tool and it also is a

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.649 
self-defense tool and it also is a
wrench<00:01:17.030> it<00:01:18.030> has<00:01:18.210> a<00:01:18.240> keyring<00:01:19.049> hole<00:01:19.320> here<00:01:20.659> put

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
wrench it has a keyring hole here put

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:22.969 
wrench it has a keyring hole here put
this<00:01:21.780> on<00:01:21.960> your<00:01:22.049> keyring<00:01:22.380> and<00:01:22.530> pretty<00:01:22.860> much

00:01:22.969 --> 00:01:22.979 
this on your keyring and pretty much

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:25.990 
this on your keyring and pretty much
you'll<00:01:23.430> almost<00:01:23.759> never<00:01:24.030> lose<00:01:24.360> your<00:01:24.540> keys

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.000 
you'll almost never lose your keys

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.249 
you'll almost never lose your keys
another<00:01:27.000> good<00:01:27.210> technique<00:01:27.390> that<00:01:27.780> we<00:01:27.869> use<00:01:28.049> with

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
another good technique that we use with

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.130 
another good technique that we use with
this<00:01:28.380> is<00:01:28.619> to<00:01:28.829> actually<00:01:29.670> flick<00:01:30.119> it<00:01:30.299> and<00:01:30.479> hit

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
this is to actually flick it and hit

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.380 
this is to actually flick it and hit
somebody's<00:01:32.000> arm<00:01:33.200> hit<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.320> bone<00:01:35.240> you<00:01:36.240> know<00:01:36.360> a

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
somebody's arm hit the bone you know a

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.390 
somebody's arm hit the bone you know a
distraction<00:01:36.990> hitting<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.530> face<00:01:37.740> hitting

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
distraction hitting the face hitting

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:41.450 
distraction hitting the face hitting
across<00:01:38.729> the<00:01:38.880> face<00:01:39.170> but<00:01:40.170> and<00:01:41.009> it's<00:01:41.159> actually

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
across the face but and it's actually

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.499 
across the face but and it's actually
just<00:01:41.909> fun<00:01:42.119> to<00:01:42.150> twirl<00:01:42.659> around<00:01:42.780> too<00:01:43.110> but<00:01:44.509> you

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
just fun to twirl around too but you

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.859 
just fun to twirl around too but you
know<00:01:45.630> it's<00:01:45.780> a<00:01:46.399> good<00:01:47.420> self-defense<00:01:48.420> tool<00:01:48.659> to

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
know it's a good self-defense tool to

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:53.060 
know it's a good self-defense tool to
have<00:01:50.869> next<00:01:51.869> thing<00:01:52.020> is<00:01:52.200> just<00:01:52.530> a<00:01:52.799> regular

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
have next thing is just a regular

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.690 
have next thing is just a regular
pocketknife<00:01:54.860> aside<00:01:55.860> from<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.130> obvious<00:01:56.250> you

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
pocketknife aside from the obvious you

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.389 
pocketknife aside from the obvious you
know<00:01:56.820> using<00:01:57.210> it<00:01:57.299> as<00:01:57.420> a<00:01:57.450> knife<00:01:57.689> but<00:01:57.960> closed<00:01:58.829> you

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 
know using it as a knife but closed you

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.130 
know using it as a knife but closed you
can<00:01:59.549> actually<00:01:59.850> use<00:01:59.969> it<00:02:00.119> as<00:02:00.240> an<00:02:00.360> impact<00:02:00.689> tool<00:02:00.899> -

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
can actually use it as an impact tool -

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.709 
can actually use it as an impact tool -
the<00:02:02.009> same<00:02:02.430> techniques<00:02:02.850> that<00:02:02.969> you<00:02:03.210> use<00:02:03.509> for

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
the same techniques that you use for

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:08.029 
the same techniques that you use for
this<00:02:03.810> you<00:02:03.869> can<00:02:04.140> also<00:02:04.290> use<00:02:04.560> for<00:02:05.490> this<00:02:07.039> already

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
this you can also use for this already

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.360 
this you can also use for this already
whereas<00:02:08.819> just<00:02:09.209> hitting<00:02:09.899> somebody's<00:02:10.370> extended

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420 
the sternum that'll pretty much almost

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:22.720 
the sternum that'll pretty much almost
drop<00:02:20.600> anybody<00:02:21.050> but<00:02:21.290> like<00:02:22.130> I<00:02:22.250> said<00:02:22.310> the<00:02:22.550> same

drop anybody but like I said the same

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.210 
drop anybody but like I said the same
techniques<00:02:23.150> can<00:02:23.660> be<00:02:23.690> used<00:02:23.810> for<00:02:24.350> pretty<00:02:25.130> much

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:25.220 
techniques can be used for pretty much

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.930 
techniques can be used for pretty much
all<00:02:25.430> of<00:02:25.610> these<00:02:26.620> another<00:02:27.620> thing<00:02:27.920> that<00:02:28.100> we<00:02:28.220> used

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
all of these another thing that we used

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.960 
all of these another thing that we used
to<00:02:29.180> is<00:02:29.390> a<00:02:29.690> Leatherman<00:02:30.400> or<00:02:31.400> not<00:02:31.670> a<00:02:31.700> Leatherman

00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:31.970 
to is a Leatherman or not a Leatherman

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:35.530 
to is a Leatherman or not a Leatherman
but<00:02:32.210> like<00:02:32.420> a<00:02:32.450> multi-tool<00:02:34.060> you<00:02:35.060> can<00:02:35.180> either<00:02:35.300> use

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
but like a multi-tool you can either use

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:38.050 
but like a multi-tool you can either use
your<00:02:35.570> clothes<00:02:35.870> like<00:02:36.080> this<00:02:36.290> or<00:02:36.680> with<00:02:37.640> this<00:02:37.820> one

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.060 
your clothes like this or with this one

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.230 
your clothes like this or with this one
you<00:02:38.150> can<00:02:38.180> flick<00:02:38.540> it<00:02:38.660> out<00:02:38.810> I<00:02:39.640> get<00:02:40.640> the<00:02:40.760> extended

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:41.240 
you can flick it out I get the extended

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:44.310 
you can flick it out I get the extended
and<00:02:41.420> use<00:02:41.600> the<00:02:41.780> pliers<00:02:42.040> as<00:02:43.040> an<00:02:43.280> impact<00:02:43.640> point

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:44.320 
and use the pliers as an impact point

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:49.500 
and use the pliers as an impact point
that's<00:02:45.320> another<00:02:47.320> technique<00:02:48.320> you<00:02:48.590> can<00:02:48.710> use

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:49.510 
that's another technique you can use

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:54.460 
that's another technique you can use
flashlights<00:02:50.510> a<00:02:51.500> lot<00:02:52.430> of<00:02:52.550> these<00:02:53.470> tactical

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:54.470 
flashlights a lot of these tactical

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.600 
flashlights a lot of these tactical
flashlights<00:02:55.150> have<00:02:56.150> the<00:02:56.420> strike<00:02:57.140> bezels<00:02:57.620> where

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
flashlights have the strike bezels where

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:01.090 
flashlights have the strike bezels where
it's<00:02:58.760> some<00:02:59.210> of<00:02:59.300> them<00:02:59.390> are<00:02:59.510> serrated<00:02:59.810> but<00:03:00.200> like

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:01.100 
it's some of them are serrated but like

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.310 
it's some of them are serrated but like
I<00:03:01.220> said<00:03:01.430> same<00:03:01.700> technique<00:03:02.120> again<00:03:02.270> you<00:03:02.960> can<00:03:03.140> use

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:03.320 
I said same technique again you can use

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:06.130 
I said same technique again you can use
it<00:03:03.500> you<00:03:04.460> know<00:03:05.090> plus<00:03:05.360> you<00:03:05.510> can<00:03:05.660> also<00:03:05.750> blind

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
it you know plus you can also blind

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.240 
it you know plus you can also blind
people<00:03:06.620> with<00:03:06.800> that<00:03:08.740> same<00:03:09.740> techniques<00:03:10.160> that

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
people with that same techniques that

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:15.220 
people with that same techniques that
you<00:03:10.430> use<00:03:12.790> just<00:03:13.790> a<00:03:13.880> bigger<00:03:14.060> flashlight<00:03:15.020> with<00:03:15.200> a

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:15.230 
you use just a bigger flashlight with a

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:20.500 
you use just a bigger flashlight with a
more<00:03:16.040> aggressive<00:03:16.280> bezel<00:03:16.880> on<00:03:17.480> this<00:03:19.450> no<00:03:20.450> of

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
more aggressive bezel on this no of

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:23.560 
more aggressive bezel on this no of
course<00:03:20.720> you<00:03:20.840> got<00:03:20.959> a<00:03:20.989> kubaton<00:03:22.270> this<00:03:23.270> one<00:03:23.420> is<00:03:23.510> a

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:23.570 
course you got a kubaton this one is a

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:25.770 
course you got a kubaton this one is a
polymer<00:03:23.959> kubaton<00:03:24.290> with<00:03:24.620> a<00:03:24.650> tapered<00:03:25.550> point

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
polymer kubaton with a tapered point

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.840 
polymer kubaton with a tapered point
it's<00:03:26.780> lighter<00:03:27.080> weight<00:03:27.170> and<00:03:27.709> it<00:03:28.459> doesn't<00:03:28.730> get

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:28.850 
it's lighter weight and it doesn't get

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:30.820 
it's lighter weight and it doesn't get
cold<00:03:29.060> in<00:03:29.330> the<00:03:29.420> winter<00:03:29.720> like<00:03:30.440> some<00:03:30.650> of<00:03:30.739> the

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:30.830 
cold in the winter like some of the

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:33.280 
cold in the winter like some of the
steel<00:03:31.040> coubertin's<00:03:31.900> put<00:03:32.900> this<00:03:33.020> on<00:03:33.200> your

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:33.290 
steel coubertin's put this on your

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:37.510 
steel coubertin's put this on your
keyring<00:03:33.910> use<00:03:34.910> the<00:03:35.200> keys<00:03:36.200> to<00:03:36.650> strike<00:03:36.920> with<00:03:37.130> also

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:37.520 
keyring use the keys to strike with also

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:40.900 
keyring use the keys to strike with also
but<00:03:38.420> this<00:03:39.320> is<00:03:39.470> another<00:03:39.680> good<00:03:39.950> self-defense

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 
but this is another good self-defense

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:45.630 
but this is another good self-defense
one<00:03:41.590> another<00:03:42.590> one<00:03:42.800> that<00:03:42.950> we<00:03:43.070> use<00:03:43.310> is<00:03:43.670> a<00:03:43.940> sharpie

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640 
one another one that we use is a sharpie

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:48.940 
one another one that we use is a sharpie
this<00:03:46.640> one<00:03:46.820> is<00:03:46.940> the<00:03:47.180> chisel<00:03:47.870> tip<00:03:48.170> sharpie<00:03:48.709> it's

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950 
this one is the chisel tip sharpie it's

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:51.220 
this one is the chisel tip sharpie it's
a<00:03:49.010> little<00:03:49.220> bit<00:03:49.310> fatter<00:03:49.660> lets<00:03:50.660> you<00:03:50.750> grip<00:03:50.959> more

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.230 
a little bit fatter lets you grip more

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:53.860 
a little bit fatter lets you grip more
but<00:03:52.160> pretty<00:03:52.700> much<00:03:52.850> anything<00:03:53.090> that<00:03:53.239> can<00:03:53.510> extend

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:53.870 
but pretty much anything that can extend

00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:55.590 
but pretty much anything that can extend
outside<00:03:54.590> of<00:03:54.709> the<00:03:54.769> poem<00:03:55.040> you<00:03:55.070> can<00:03:55.250> use<00:03:55.400> a

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:55.600 
outside of the poem you can use a

00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:00.009 
outside of the poem you can use a
striking<00:03:56.600> technique<00:03:56.989> with<00:03:58.720> you<00:03:59.720> know<00:03:59.840> real

00:04:00.009 --> 00:04:00.019 
striking technique with you know real

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:01.930 
striking technique with you know real
inconspicuous<00:04:00.440> pretty<00:04:01.280> much<00:04:01.430> anybody<00:04:01.640> can

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:01.940 
inconspicuous pretty much anybody can

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:05.350 
inconspicuous pretty much anybody can
carry<00:04:02.209> this<00:04:03.459> but<00:04:04.459> you<00:04:04.850> know<00:04:04.970> if<00:04:05.060> you<00:04:05.180> know<00:04:05.300> how

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:05.360 
carry this but you know if you know how

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:09.009 
carry this but you know if you know how
to<00:04:05.450> use<00:04:05.600> it<00:04:05.810> and<00:04:06.610> it's<00:04:07.610> better<00:04:07.850> for<00:04:08.060> you<00:04:08.180> the

00:04:09.009 --> 00:04:09.019 
to use it and it's better for you the

00:04:09.019 --> 00:04:11.680 
to use it and it's better for you the
one<00:04:09.170> thing<00:04:09.320> we<00:04:09.410> use<00:04:09.590> this<00:04:09.739> for<00:04:10.010> also<00:04:10.370> is<00:04:10.690> when

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:11.690 
one thing we use this for also is when

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:15.370 
one thing we use this for also is when
there's<00:04:11.900> some<00:04:12.110> knife<00:04:12.320> sparring<00:04:14.230> usually<00:04:15.230> two

with any artery or anything then pretty
much<00:04:40.000> lose<00:04:41.580> same<00:04:42.580> sharpie<00:04:43.000> but<00:04:43.390> just<00:04:43.630> a<00:04:43.690> little

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:43.900 
much lose same sharpie but just a little

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:47.400 
much lose same sharpie but just a little
bit<00:04:44.020> thinner<00:04:44.200> but<00:04:44.430> same<00:04:45.430> concept<00:04:45.940> you<00:04:46.230> can<00:04:47.230> use

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:47.410 
bit thinner but same concept you can use

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:53.030 
bit thinner but same concept you can use
the<00:04:47.560> extended<00:04:48.480> area<00:04:49.480> to<00:04:50.440> do<00:04:50.590> is<00:04:50.710> striking
