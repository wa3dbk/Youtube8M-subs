00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:40.490 
have any issues there and that dipstick

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:42.850 
have any issues there and that dipstick
is<00:00:40.790> just<00:00:41.030> right<00:00:41.330> dipsticks<00:00:42.290> right<00:00:42.530> here<00:00:42.740> and

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:42.860 
is just right dipsticks right here and

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:44.800 
is just right dipsticks right here and
it<00:00:42.920> dislike<00:00:43.250> down<00:00:43.400> there<00:00:43.580> just<00:00:43.820> twists<00:00:44.630> in

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:44.810 
it dislike down there just twists in

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:46.240 
it dislike down there just twists in
there's<00:00:45.050> a<00:00:45.080> little<00:00:45.260> o-ring<00:00:45.440> on<00:00:45.800> there<00:00:46.070> that's

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:46.250 
there's a little o-ring on there that's

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:47.800 
there's a little o-ring on there that's
you<00:00:46.370> that<00:00:46.790> keeps<00:00:47.060> the<00:00:47.150> oil<00:00:47.180> from<00:00:47.450> leaking<00:00:47.630> out

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:47.810 
you that keeps the oil from leaking out

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:49.090 
you that keeps the oil from leaking out
so<00:00:48.050> when<00:00:48.170> you<00:00:48.230> put<00:00:48.380> it<00:00:48.440> back<00:00:48.500> in<00:00:48.800> you<00:00:48.950> don't

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100 
so when you put it back in you don't

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:54.460 
so when you put it back in you don't
want<00:00:49.220> to<00:00:50.200> twist<00:00:51.200> too<00:00:51.500> hard<00:00:51.770> it's<00:00:52.040> not<00:00:53.470> don't

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:54.470 
want to twist too hard it's not don't

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:56.350 
want to twist too hard it's not don't
like<00:00:54.620> you<00:00:54.739> split<00:00:55.580> that<00:00:55.730> overrating<00:00:56.150> and<00:00:56.270> then

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:56.360 
like you split that overrating and then

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:57.820 
like you split that overrating and then
oil<00:00:56.480> will<00:00:56.750> leak<00:00:56.900> out<00:00:57.080> there<00:00:57.320> so<00:00:57.470> you<00:00:57.590> just<00:00:57.710> get

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:57.830 
oil will leak out there so you just get

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:01.540 
oil will leak out there so you just get
snug<00:00:58.190> that's<00:00:58.580> how<00:00:58.700> you<00:00:58.760> check<00:00:58.970> the<00:00:59.120> oil

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:01.550 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:04.640 

make<00:01:02.550> sure<00:01:02.699> that<00:01:02.940> the<00:01:03.780> oil<00:01:03.960> level<00:01:04.409> is<00:01:04.470> where's

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:04.650 
make sure that the oil level is where's

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:05.830 
make sure that the oil level is where's
that<00:01:04.890> you<00:01:05.129> want<00:01:05.309> to<00:01:05.400> get<00:01:05.519> it

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:05.840 
that you want to get it

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.090 
that you want to get it
right<00:01:06.409> one<00:01:06.560> that<00:01:06.740> changes<00:01:07.210> or<00:01:08.210> changes<00:01:08.479> in<00:01:08.720> the

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.100 
right one that changes or changes in the

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.080 
right one that changes or changes in the
dimension<00:01:10.100> there<00:01:10.310> that's<00:01:10.670> full

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
dimension there that's full

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.149 
dimension there that's full
this<00:01:12.630> would<00:01:12.780> be<00:01:12.899> halfway<00:01:13.469> down<00:01:13.740> that<00:01:14.009> line

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
this would be halfway down that line

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:16.310 
this would be halfway down that line
there<00:01:14.460> so<00:01:14.490> it's<00:01:14.759> time<00:01:14.880> to<00:01:14.909> get<00:01:15.119> you<00:01:15.320> three

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
there so it's time to get you three

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.020 
there so it's time to get you three
quarters<00:01:16.590> were<00:01:16.679> halfway<00:01:16.829> down<00:01:17.219> and<00:01:17.609> he<00:01:17.670> need

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
quarters were halfway down and he need

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.149 
quarters were halfway down and he need
to<00:01:18.270> be<00:01:18.719> concerned<00:01:19.109> about<00:01:19.200> that<00:01:19.380> and<00:01:19.770> probably

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
to be concerned about that and probably

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.190 
to be concerned about that and probably
add<00:01:20.369> some<00:01:20.399> oil<00:01:20.700> to<00:01:20.880> it

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:23.200 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.920 

either<00:01:23.770> you're<00:01:24.039> burning<00:01:24.369> some<00:01:24.490> oil<00:01:24.930> holder

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:25.930 
either you're burning some oil holder

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:29.200 
either you're burning some oil holder
engine<00:01:26.229> or<00:01:26.350> he<00:01:26.469> might<00:01:26.619> be<00:01:26.770> leaking<00:01:27.070> suppose

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.210 
engine or he might be leaking suppose

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.960 
engine or he might be leaking suppose
I<00:01:29.270> changed<00:01:29.990> it<00:01:30.080> a<00:01:30.170> little<00:01:30.290> more<00:01:30.440> often<00:01:30.970> you're

ground<00:02:07.130> so<00:02:07.430> you<00:02:07.550> know<00:02:08.410> don't<00:02:09.410> pollute

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.300 

that's<00:02:15.230> it<00:02:15.380> runs<00:02:15.560> out<00:02:15.680> like<00:02:15.920> that<00:02:16.069> was<00:02:16.280> a

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
that's it runs out like that was a

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.290 
that's it runs out like that was a
little<00:02:16.460> warmer

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:18.300 
little warmer

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.870 
little warmer
we're<00:02:18.630> gonna<00:02:18.870> get<00:02:19.050> moil<00:02:19.320> get<00:02:20.100> more<00:02:20.340> oil<00:02:20.370> out<00:02:20.850> of

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:20.880 
we're gonna get moil get more oil out of

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:22.370 
we're gonna get moil get more oil out of
it

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
it

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.430 
it
once<00:02:22.860> more<00:02:23.100> warmer

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:24.440 
once more warmer

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:26.770 
once more warmer
I<00:02:24.470> can<00:02:25.040> get<00:02:25.220> it<00:02:25.340> all<00:02:25.460> out<00:02:25.490> to<00:02:25.760> the<00:02:26.060> engine<00:02:26.510> holds

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:26.780 
I can get it all out to the engine holds

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.830 
I can get it all out to the engine holds
by<00:02:26.900> about<00:02:27.170> 32<00:02:27.530> ounces<00:02:28.040> the<00:02:29.030> oil<00:02:29.210> in<00:02:29.570> those

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:29.840 
by about 32 ounces the oil in those

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:31.820 
by about 32 ounces the oil in those
places<00:02:30.110> in<00:02:30.380> the<00:02:30.530> engine

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
places in the engine

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.680 
places in the engine
if<00:02:32.040> you<00:02:32.160> can't<00:02:32.370> get<00:02:32.550> it<00:02:32.700> completely<00:02:33.240> out<00:02:33.270> of<00:02:33.570> it

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
if you can't get it completely out of it

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.309 
if you can't get it completely out of it
so<00:02:33.930> you're<00:02:34.080> gonna<00:02:34.170> get<00:02:34.380> about

00:02:36.309 --> 00:02:36.319 
so you're gonna get about

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:39.740 
so you're gonna get about
28<00:02:36.799> ounces<00:02:37.250> so

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:39.750 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.080 

it's<00:02:40.080> pretty<00:02:40.350> typical<00:02:40.620> to<00:02:40.890> a<00:02:41.070> standard<00:02:41.880> car

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
it's pretty typical to a standard car

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.080 
it's pretty typical to a standard car
oil<00:02:42.300> -<00:02:43.430> basically<00:02:44.430> it's<00:02:44.550> the<00:02:44.670> same<00:02:44.850> type<00:02:45.060> of

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:45.090 
oil - basically it's the same type of

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:47.180 
oil - basically it's the same type of
oil<00:02:45.300> that<00:02:45.390> you<00:02:45.540> put<00:02:45.630> in<00:02:45.810> your<00:02:45.870> cars<00:02:46.190> inside

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:47.190 
oil that you put in your cars inside

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:50.060 
oil that you put in your cars inside
that<00:02:47.520> this<00:02:47.850> is<00:02:48.000> that<00:02:48.240> oil<00:02:48.480> plug<00:02:48.960> that<00:02:49.740> I<00:02:49.800> took

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
that this is that oil plug that I took

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:54.780 
that this is that oil plug that I took
out<00:02:50.370> with<00:02:50.520> the<00:02:50.640> wrench<00:02:50.880> and<00:02:51.860> then<00:02:52.860> inside

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
out with the wrench and then inside

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:58.709 
out with the wrench and then inside
there<00:02:55.360> is<00:02:55.989> a<00:02:56.049> little<00:02:56.230> filter<00:02:57.239> this<00:02:58.239> catches

00:02:58.709 --> 00:02:58.719 
there is a little filter this catches

00:02:58.719 --> 00:03:01.800 
there is a little filter this catches
any<00:02:58.900> of<00:02:59.049> the<00:03:00.030> contaminants<00:03:01.030> especially<00:03:01.689> on

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
any of the contaminants especially on

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.209 
any of the contaminants especially on
the<00:03:01.900> break<00:03:02.079> in<00:03:02.290> the<00:03:02.409> first<00:03:02.650> thousand<00:03:03.040> miles

00:03:27.569 --> 00:03:27.579 
when she first starts running you'll

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:29.460 
when she first starts running you'll
have<00:03:27.730> some<00:03:27.939> noble<00:03:28.569> work<00:03:28.720> air<00:03:29.019> in<00:03:29.170> there<00:03:29.319> and

catch a little metal shavings those type
of<00:03:31.000> things<00:03:31.090> that's<00:03:31.329> why<00:03:31.389> we're<00:03:31.629> changing<00:03:31.959> the

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:32.079 
of things that's why we're changing the

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:34.890 
of things that's why we're changing the
soil<00:03:32.760> to<00:03:33.760> get<00:03:33.849> that<00:03:34.060> out<00:03:34.269> there<00:03:34.480> just<00:03:34.750> in<00:03:34.870> case

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:34.900

you might not see you but it's kind of

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:38.370 
you might not see you but it's kind of
cleaning<00:03:37.359> them

cleaning them
there's<00:03:39.340> a<00:03:39.490> little<00:03:39.820> bit

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.390 

this<00:03:42.810> is<00:03:42.989> no<00:03:43.170> this<00:03:43.470> is<00:03:43.620> the<00:03:43.709> drain<00:03:43.920> plug<00:03:44.099> once

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
this is no this is the drain plug once

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.460 
this is no this is the drain plug once
again<00:03:44.640> there's<00:03:44.849> a<00:03:44.879> little<00:03:45.030> rubber<00:03:45.780> o-ring<00:03:46.319> on

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 
again there's a little rubber o-ring on

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.589 
again there's a little rubber o-ring on
you<00:03:47.459> putting<00:03:47.700> it<00:03:47.760> back<00:03:47.879> in<00:03:48.090> you<00:03:48.239> don't<00:03:48.330> want<00:03:48.420> to

00:03:48.589 --> 00:03:48.599 
you putting it back in you don't want to

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:51.530 
you putting it back in you don't want to
tighten<00:03:49.440> it<00:03:49.500> too<00:03:49.769> tight<00:03:50.010> so<00:03:50.849> he<00:03:50.940> goes<00:03:51.090> back<00:03:51.330> in

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
tighten it too tight so he goes back in

00:03:51.540 --> 00:04:02.450 
tighten it too tight so he goes back in
one<00:03:51.750> way<00:03:58.010> -<00:03:59.010> rats

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:02.460 

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:07.480 

it's<00:04:03.270> got<00:04:03.420> a<00:04:03.450> hand<00:04:03.720> tighten<00:04:04.110> it

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:07.490 

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:09.610 

just<00:04:08.390> turn<00:04:08.660> out<00:04:08.810> this<00:04:08.960> a<00:04:08.990> little<00:04:09.200> bit<00:04:09.380> felt

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:09.620 
just turn out this a little bit felt

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:13.020 
just turn out this a little bit felt
snug

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.030 

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:14.250 

so<00:04:13.330> it<00:04:13.450> gives<00:04:13.600> you<00:04:13.720> this<00:04:13.840> little<00:04:14.140> bit<00:04:14.230> of

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260 
so it gives you this little bit of

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:20.099 
so it gives you this little bit of
resistance<00:04:14.590> and<00:04:15.070> wipe<00:04:15.790> everything<00:04:15.970> off<00:04:17.489> now

00:04:20.099 --> 00:04:20.109 
resistance and wipe everything off now

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:22.920 
resistance and wipe everything off now
neither<00:04:20.859> nice<00:04:21.789> long<00:04:22.030> funnel<00:04:22.419> like<00:04:22.509> this<00:04:22.720> you

neither nice long funnel like this you

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:26.450 
neither nice long funnel like this you
buy<00:04:23.139> it<00:04:23.199> hardware<00:04:24.069> store

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460 
buy it hardware store

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:28.340 
buy it hardware store
I<00:04:26.520> use<00:04:26.789> casserole
