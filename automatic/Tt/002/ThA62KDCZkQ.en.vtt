00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
tutorial will be working inside of Swift

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.540 
tutorial will be working inside of Swift
3d<00:00:58.199> version<00:00:58.680> 5<00:00:58.920> and<00:00:59.270> we're<00:01:00.270> creating<00:01:00.809> a<00:01:01.550> an

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
3d version 5 and we're creating a an

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.210 
3d version 5 and we're creating a an
animated<00:01:03.120> 3d<00:01:03.510> globe<00:01:04.080> it<00:01:04.409> would<00:01:04.619> be<00:01:04.710> a<00:01:04.739> spinning

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
animated 3d globe it would be a spinning

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.700 
animated 3d globe it would be a spinning
globe<00:01:05.369> and<00:01:05.760> it<00:01:06.330> will<00:01:06.420> have<00:01:06.630> opaque<00:01:07.140> qualities

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
globe and it will have opaque qualities

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.380 
globe and it will have opaque qualities
to<00:01:07.920> it<00:01:07.950> to<00:01:08.250> where<00:01:08.400> you<00:01:08.580> can<00:01:08.760> kind<00:01:09.090> of<00:01:09.210> see

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
to it to where you can kind of see

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.590 
to it to where you can kind of see
through<00:01:09.689> certain<00:01:10.439> aspects<00:01:10.799> of<00:01:10.950> it<00:01:11.360> so<00:01:12.360> the

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 
through certain aspects of it so the

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.899 
through certain aspects of it so the
first<00:01:12.810> thing<00:01:12.869> we're<00:01:13.080> going<00:01:13.170> to<00:01:13.229> do<00:01:13.439> is<00:01:13.760> we<00:01:14.760> open

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
first thing we're going to do is we open

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:17.240 
first thing we're going to do is we open
the<00:01:15.330> Swift<00:01:15.659> 3d<00:01:15.990> version<00:01:16.409> 5<00:01:16.560> and<00:01:16.799> I<00:01:16.830> have<00:01:16.979> a<00:01:17.009> new

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
the Swift 3d version 5 and I have a new

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.039 
the Swift 3d version 5 and I have a new
brand<00:01:17.610> new<00:01:17.729> file<00:01:18.000> here<00:01:18.360> I<00:01:18.479> didn't<00:01:18.810> do<00:01:18.869> any

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
brand new file here I didn't do any

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:20.660 
brand new file here I didn't do any
adjustments<00:01:19.619> yet<00:01:19.799> but<00:01:20.340> I'm<00:01:20.400> going<00:01:20.520> to<00:01:20.580> go

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
adjustments yet but I'm going to go

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.600 
adjustments yet but I'm going to go
ahead<00:01:20.759> and<00:01:20.909> change<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:22.110> layout<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:23.159> output

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
ahead and change the layout the output

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.320 
ahead and change the layout the output
size<00:01:23.880> of<00:01:24.150> the<00:01:24.240> file<00:01:24.479> to<00:01:24.780> 200<00:01:25.560> pixels<00:01:25.950> by<00:01:26.759> 200

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
size of the file to 200 pixels by 200

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:31.910 
size of the file to 200 pixels by 200
pixels<00:01:28.130> and<00:01:29.210> now<00:01:30.210> you<00:01:30.270> can<00:01:30.630> see<00:01:30.869> adjust<00:01:31.740> the

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
pixels and now you can see adjust the

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.280 
pixels and now you can see adjust the
size<00:01:32.130> of<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:32.909> window<00:01:33.119> there<00:01:33.509> and<00:01:33.720> now<00:01:34.229> I'm

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
size of the window there and now I'm

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.469 
size of the window there and now I'm
going<00:01:34.470> to<00:01:34.530> add<00:01:34.680> a<00:01:35.009> sphere<00:01:36.000> creates<00:01:36.750> fear<00:01:38.479> get

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
going to add a sphere creates fear get

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.749 
going to add a sphere creates fear get
the<00:01:39.509> segmentation<00:01:40.170> up<00:01:40.500> to<00:01:40.650> 64<00:01:41.310> for<00:01:41.640> the

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
the segmentation up to 64 for the

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.789 
the segmentation up to 64 for the
latitude<00:01:42.210> and<00:01:42.390> longitude<00:01:43.020> and<00:01:44.360> then<00:01:45.799> we'll

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
latitude and longitude and then we'll

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:51.160 
latitude and longitude and then we'll
highlight<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.310> sphere<00:01:47.579> and<00:01:47.759> we<00:01:48.720> go<00:01:48.930> to<00:01:49.549> bitmap

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:51.170 
highlight the sphere and we go to bitmap

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:56.820 
highlight the sphere and we go to bitmap
now<00:01:52.170> on<00:01:52.500> materials<00:01:53.100> bitmap<00:01:53.850> and

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:56.830 

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:00.880 

let's<00:01:57.830> see<00:01:59.170> now<00:02:00.170> actually<00:02:00.560> you<00:02:00.650> don't<00:02:00.740> even

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:00.890 
let's see now actually you don't even

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:02.440 
let's see now actually you don't even
have<00:02:01.040> to<00:02:01.130> go<00:02:01.280> to<00:02:01.310> bitmap<00:02:01.550> you<00:02:02.000> can<00:02:02.150> just<00:02:02.240> go<00:02:02.420> to

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
have to go to bitmap you can just go to

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:06.010 
have to go to bitmap you can just go to
materials<00:02:03.320> here<00:02:03.680> you<00:02:04.640> click<00:02:04.850> materials<00:02:05.420> once

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020

seeing light lighting can all be

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.550 
seeing light lighting can all be
controlled<00:04:03.200> down<00:04:03.410> here<00:04:03.650> so<00:04:05.260> what<00:04:06.260> we'll<00:04:06.410> do

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:06.560 
controlled down here so what we'll do

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:11.020 
controlled down here so what we'll do
then<00:04:06.590> is<00:04:07.040> go<00:04:07.250> to<00:04:07.310> preview<00:04:08.060> and<00:04:08.269> export<00:04:08.750> and<00:04:10.030> now

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.030 
then is go to preview and export and now

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:14.710 
then is go to preview and export and now
this<00:04:11.540> is<00:04:11.780> where<00:04:11.989> it'll<00:04:12.380> render<00:04:12.560> out<00:04:12.860> and<00:04:13.720> swf

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:14.720 
this is where it'll render out and swf

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.810 
this is where it'll render out and swf
file<00:04:15.019> for<00:04:15.319> us<00:04:15.440> but<00:04:15.650> first<00:04:15.830> we<00:04:15.980> want<00:04:16.100> to<00:04:16.190> click

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:16.820
