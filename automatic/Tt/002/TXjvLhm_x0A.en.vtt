00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:04.789 

hey<00:00:02.520> guys<00:00:02.760> this<00:00:03.389> is<00:00:03.510> a<00:00:03.720> wave<00:00:04.020> function<00:00:04.529> here

00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:04.799 
hey guys this is a wave function here

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:07.579 
hey guys this is a wave function here
with<00:00:05.160> air<00:00:05.490> one<00:00:05.730> and<00:00:05.910> we<00:00:06.480> are<00:00:06.720> going<00:00:07.080> to<00:00:07.350> talk

00:00:07.579 --> 00:00:07.589 
with air one and we are going to talk

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:10.700 
with air one and we are going to talk
about<00:00:08.490> the<00:00:08.910> assassination<00:00:09.240> spec<00:00:10.110> when<00:00:10.590> we

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
about the assassination spec when we

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.580 
about the assassination spec when we
turn<00:00:10.920> the<00:00:11.099> sound<00:00:11.550> effects<00:00:11.969> on<00:00:12.179> there<00:00:12.590> and

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
turn the sound effects on there and

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.310 
turn the sound effects on there and
hopefully<00:00:14.580> I<00:00:14.849> have<00:00:15.210> remembered<00:00:15.540> to<00:00:15.929> turn<00:00:16.080> on

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
hopefully I have remembered to turn on

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.849 
hopefully I have remembered to turn on
my<00:00:16.470> mic<00:00:16.770> this<00:00:17.010> time<00:00:18.170> so<00:00:19.170> that<00:00:19.380> I<00:00:19.410> don't<00:00:19.529> have<00:00:19.740> to

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
my mic this time so that I don't have to

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.290 
my mic this time so that I don't have to
do<00:00:20.100> another<00:00:20.400> take<00:00:21.650> but<00:00:23.000> assassination<00:00:24.000> spec

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
do another take but assassination spec

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.269 
do another take but assassination spec
is<00:00:24.510> probably<00:00:25.609> the<00:00:26.609> easiest<00:00:26.640> of<00:00:27.359> the<00:00:28.279> rogue

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
is probably the easiest of the rogue

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.720 
is probably the easiest of the rogue
specs<00:00:30.170> basically<00:00:31.170> have<00:00:31.349> one<00:00:31.619> finisher<00:00:32.189> that

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 
specs basically have one finisher that

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.970 
specs basically have one finisher that
you're<00:00:33.000> using<00:00:33.270> and<00:00:33.980> that<00:00:34.980> is<00:00:35.190> a<00:00:35.690> rupture<00:00:36.980> since

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
you're using and that is a rupture since

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.830 
you're using and that is a rupture since
slice<00:00:38.280> and<00:00:38.489> dice<00:00:39.050> is<00:00:40.100> maintained<00:00:41.100> by<00:00:41.719> your<00:00:42.719> in

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
slice and dice is maintained by your in

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.340 
slice and dice is maintained by your in
denim<00:00:43.170> so<00:00:43.440> as<00:00:43.950> you<00:00:44.070> can<00:00:44.160> see<00:00:44.989> slice<00:00:45.989> and<00:00:46.200> dice

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
denim so as you can see slice and dice

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.790 
denim so as you can see slice and dice
got<00:00:46.760> refreshed<00:00:47.760> to<00:00:48.120> maximum<00:00:48.660> duration<00:00:48.960> just

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
got refreshed to maximum duration just

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.229 
got refreshed to maximum duration just
by<00:00:49.920> finishing<00:00:50.370> with<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.000> venom<00:00:51.590> now<00:00:52.590> we<00:00:52.649> get

00:00:53.229 --> 00:00:53.239 
by finishing with the venom now we get

00:00:53.239 --> 00:01:00.439 
by finishing with the venom now we get
cooperate<00:00:54.239> going<00:00:54.600> here<00:00:54.780> too<00:00:57.920> and<00:00:59.030> I<00:01:00.030> do<00:01:00.090> have

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
cooperate going here too and I do have

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.950 
cooperate going here too and I do have
the<00:01:00.629> deadly<00:01:00.989> momentum<00:01:01.680> glyph<00:01:02.129> which<00:01:02.579> I

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:02.960 
the deadly momentum glyph which I

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.700 
the deadly momentum glyph which I
refreshes<00:01:03.960> them<00:01:04.199> to<00:01:05.960> whatever<00:01:06.960> duration<00:01:07.590> I

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
refreshes them to whatever duration I

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.420 
refreshes them to whatever duration I
had<00:01:07.890> them<00:01:08.070> at

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:10.430 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.000 

that's<00:01:11.090> a<00:01:11.240> key<00:01:11.420> point<00:01:11.450> so<00:01:12.290> if<00:01:12.440> you<00:01:12.590> only<00:01:12.740> have<00:01:12.980> a

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:13.010 
that's a key point so if you only have a

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:16.150 
that's a key point so if you only have a
say<00:01:13.700> a<00:01:13.730> 10-second<00:01:14.570> cooperate<00:01:15.530> going<00:01:15.920> it's

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:16.160 
say a 10-second cooperate going it's

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:17.770 
say a 10-second cooperate going it's
only<00:01:16.460> ever<00:01:16.580> going<00:01:16.700> to<00:01:16.850> get<00:01:16.910> a<00:01:16.970> refreshed<00:01:17.390> to<00:01:17.570> 10

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780 
only ever going to get a refreshed to 10

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.620 
only ever going to get a refreshed to 10
seconds<00:01:18.170> so<00:01:18.580> you<00:01:19.580> always<00:01:19.760> want<00:01:19.910> to<00:01:20.180> try<00:01:20.360> to<00:01:20.420> get

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:20.630 
seconds so you always want to try to get

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.150 
seconds so you always want to try to get
it<00:01:20.750> maximum<00:01:21.470> and<00:01:21.680> then<00:01:21.800> just<00:01:22.700> maintain<00:01:23.210> it

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:24.160 
it maximum and then just maintain it

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.440 
it maximum and then just maintain it
sometimes<00:01:25.160> you<00:01:25.310> kill<00:01:25.520> stuff<00:01:25.760> that<00:01:26.060> uh<00:01:26.090> that

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:26.450 
sometimes you kill stuff that uh that

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.050 
sometimes you kill stuff that uh that
you<00:01:26.900> don't<00:01:27.080> need<00:01:28.570> just<00:01:29.570> to<00:01:29.690> keep<00:01:29.840> it<00:01:29.990> going

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:31.060 
you don't need just to keep it going

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:35.650 
you don't need just to keep it going
phys<00:01:32.060> I'm<00:01:32.210> a<00:01:32.240> lazy<00:01:32.540> bum<00:01:32.869> and<00:01:34.450> probably<00:01:35.450> want<00:01:35.630> to

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:35.660 
phys I'm a lazy bum and probably want to

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:38.780 
phys I'm a lazy bum and probably want to
use<00:01:35.720> that<00:01:35.990> little<00:01:36.200> item<00:01:36.860> here

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
use that little item here

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.670 
use that little item here
that's<00:01:39.390> a<00:01:39.480> little<00:01:39.540> trick<00:01:39.810> with<00:01:39.840> these<00:01:40.080> guys<00:01:40.350> is

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:40.680 
that's a little trick with these guys is

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:46.040 
that's a little trick with these guys is
uh<00:01:41.870> it's<00:01:42.870> gonna<00:01:43.050> fall<00:01:43.230> oh<00:01:43.500> there<00:01:43.800> we<00:01:43.860> go<00:01:45.050> don't

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:46.050 
uh it's gonna fall oh there we go don't

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:48.140 
uh it's gonna fall oh there we go don't
let's<00:01:46.200> going<00:01:46.380> to<00:01:46.440> follow<00:01:46.590> you<00:01:46.970> don't<00:01:47.970> actually

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:48.150 
let's going to follow you don't actually

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:49.910 
let's going to follow you don't actually
have<00:01:48.330> to<00:01:48.450> channel<00:01:48.750> the<00:01:48.990> full<00:01:49.200> duration<00:01:49.440> on

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
have to channel the full duration on

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:54.680 
have to channel the full duration on
these<00:01:50.100> guys<00:01:50.310> see<00:01:52.310> it<00:01:53.310> immediately<00:01:53.700> works<00:01:54.150> so

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:54.690 
these guys see it immediately works so

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:59.030 
these guys see it immediately works so
you<00:01:54.750> can<00:01:54.930> just<00:01:55.520> get<00:01:56.520> right<00:01:56.730> to<00:01:56.760> it<00:01:57.200> well<00:01:58.200> for

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
you can just get right to it well for

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.900 
you can just get right to it well for
rupture<00:02:00.320> there's<00:02:01.320> some<00:02:01.530> key<00:02:01.710> points<00:02:01.979> is<00:02:02.400> you

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:02.910 
rupture there's some key points is you

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:04.820 
rupture there's some key points is you
can<00:02:03.090> refresh<00:02:03.450> it<00:02:03.690> at<00:02:03.840> two<00:02:04.020> seconds<00:02:04.500> without

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:04.830 
can refresh it at two seconds without

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:10.680 
can refresh it at two seconds without
losing<00:02:05.340> any<00:02:05.580> ticks<00:02:06.380> so

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:10.690 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:12.930 

so<00:02:11.320> whenever<00:02:11.560> he<00:02:11.740> gets<00:02:11.860> down<00:02:12.100> to<00:02:12.310> two<00:02:12.460> seconds

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 
so whenever he gets down to two seconds

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.640 
so whenever he gets down to two seconds
here<00:02:13.570> I'll<00:02:13.750> show<00:02:13.780> you<00:02:14.130> you<00:02:15.130> know<00:02:16.410> stand<00:02:17.410> here

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
here I'll show you you know stand here

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:24.170 
here I'll show you you know stand here
get<00:02:17.890> beat<00:02:18.130> on<00:02:18.160> a<00:02:18.310> little<00:02:18.670> bit

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:24.180 

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:25.920 

nah

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:25.930 
nah

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.380 
nah
alright<00:02:26.409> so<00:02:26.620> this<00:02:26.709> two-sided<00:02:27.159> says<00:02:27.579> 24-second

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:28.390 
alright so this two-sided says 24-second

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:30.539 
alright so this two-sided says 24-second
ruptures<00:02:28.750> you<00:02:29.019> see<00:02:29.230> it<00:02:29.349> went<00:02:29.530> up<00:02:29.620> through<00:02:29.829> 26

00:02:30.539 --> 00:02:30.549 
ruptures you see it went up through 26

00:02:30.549 --> 00:02:35.640 
ruptures you see it went up through 26
seconds<00:02:31.030> save<00:02:31.840> that<00:02:31.870> last<00:02:32.530> tick<00:02:33.599> and<00:02:34.650> you

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
seconds save that last tick and you

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.099 
seconds save that last tick and you
always<00:02:35.890> want<00:02:36.310> to<00:02:36.340> keep<00:02:36.519> rupture<00:02:36.969> going<00:02:37.390> is

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:38.109 
always want to keep rupture going is

00:02:38.109 --> 00:02:39.660 
always want to keep rupture going is
pretty<00:02:38.439> much<00:02:38.620> the<00:02:38.680> first<00:02:39.099> thing<00:02:39.400> that<00:02:39.430> you

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
pretty much the first thing that you

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.910 
pretty much the first thing that you
want<00:02:39.700> to<00:02:39.939> get<00:02:40.120> up<00:02:40.269> open<00:02:40.719> up<00:02:40.810> with<00:02:40.989> growth<00:02:41.290> it

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
want to get up open up with growth it

when you first get to 90 your haste is

00:03:50.320 --> 00:04:06.099 
when you first get to 90 your haste is
really<00:03:50.980> low<00:03:53.370> mom<00:03:54.370> why<00:03:54.610> these<00:03:54.670> guys

okay when you first get to 90 case is

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:12.979 
okay when you first get to 90 case is
really<00:04:09.659> a<00:04:09.810> problem<00:04:11.719> assassination<00:04:12.719> helps

that<00:04:13.140> a<00:04:13.170> little<00:04:13.739> bit<00:04:13.859> because<00:04:15.199> it's<00:04:16.199> kind<00:04:16.440> of

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
that a little bit because it's kind of

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:21.140 
that a little bit because it's kind of
bounced<00:04:16.709> around<00:04:16.979> a<00:04:17.340> static<00:04:19.070> paste<00:04:20.150> region

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
bounced around a static paste region

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:27.080 
bounced around a static paste region
because<00:04:21.780> well<00:04:22.160> combats<00:04:23.160> got<00:04:23.460> a<00:04:26.090> combat

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:27.090 
because well combats got a combat

00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.540 
because well combats got a combat
potency<00:04:27.690> which<00:04:27.930> skills<00:04:28.320> off<00:04:28.530> of<00:04:28.560> it<00:04:28.860> how<00:04:29.190> fast

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:29.550 
potency which skills off of it how fast

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:36.320 
potency which skills off of it how fast
you<00:04:30.710> kind<00:04:31.710> of<00:04:31.830> double<00:04:32.190> dips<00:04:32.400> off<00:04:32.610> a<00:04:32.639> haste<00:04:35.330> one

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.330 
you kind of double dips off a haste one

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:39.670 
you kind of double dips off a haste one
thing<00:04:36.539> about<00:04:36.840> assassination<00:04:37.650> is<00:04:37.979> that<00:04:38.250> it<00:04:38.430> is

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:39.680 
thing about assassination is that it is

thing about assassination is that it is
it's<00:04:40.680> not<00:04:40.860> as<00:04:40.919> spammy<00:04:41.490> as<00:04:41.759> most<00:04:42.030> effects<00:04:42.300> if

00:04:42.469 --> 00:04:42.479 
it's not as spammy as most effects if

00:04:42.479 --> 00:04:44.540 
it's not as spammy as most effects if
you<00:04:42.599> pay<00:04:42.780> attention<00:04:42.900> to<00:04:43.380> how<00:04:43.889> many<00:04:43.949> times<00:04:44.370> I'm
