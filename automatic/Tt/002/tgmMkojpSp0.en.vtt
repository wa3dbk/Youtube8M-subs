blaze just like all the other ones is

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.990 
blaze just like all the other ones is
HP's<00:00:17.130> at<00:00:17.430> 110<00:00:18.180> his<00:00:18.690> attack<00:00:19.050> as<00:00:19.400> 123<00:00:20.400> his

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
HP's at 110 his attack as 123 his

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.470 
HP's at 110 his attack as 123 his
defense<00:00:21.420> is<00:00:21.630> 65<00:00:22.199> a<00:00:22.230> special<00:00:22.980> tax<00:00:23.160> 100<00:00:23.910> his

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
defense is 65 a special tax 100 his

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.570 
defense is 65 a special tax 100 his
special<00:00:24.930> defense<00:00:25.199> is<00:00:25.380> 65<00:00:25.920> and<00:00:26.189> his<00:00:26.279> speed<00:00:26.550> is

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
special defense is 65 and his speed is

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.830 
special defense is 65 and his speed is
65<00:00:27.240> so<00:00:28.109> obviously<00:00:28.590> he's<00:00:28.890> not<00:00:29.179> very<00:00:30.179> defensive

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
65 so obviously he's not very defensive

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.370 
65 so obviously he's not very defensive
he's<00:00:31.109> not<00:00:31.289> very<00:00:31.529> fast<00:00:31.969> but<00:00:32.969> he<00:00:33.480> is<00:00:33.510> an<00:00:33.690> FHP<00:00:34.020> that

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
he's not very fast but he is an FHP that

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:35.930 
he's not very fast but he is an FHP that
hopefully<00:00:34.649> he<00:00:34.739> can<00:00:34.829> take<00:00:35.070> a<00:00:35.100> couple<00:00:35.370> hits<00:00:35.640> and

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
hopefully he can take a couple hits and

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.430 
hopefully he can take a couple hits and
he<00:00:36.030> has<00:00:36.059> enough<00:00:36.600> tak<00:00:36.870> that<00:00:37.110> he<00:00:37.170> can<00:00:37.320> definitely

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:37.440 
he has enough tak that he can definitely

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.150 
he has enough tak that he can definitely
throw<00:00:38.010> them<00:00:38.489> back<00:00:39.320> so<00:00:40.320> this<00:00:40.469> first<00:00:40.620> set<00:00:40.890> here

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
throw them back so this first set here

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.889 
throw them back so this first set here
is<00:00:41.250> actually<00:00:41.399> my<00:00:41.700> favorite<00:00:42.059> one<00:00:42.450> it's<00:00:42.690> not

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
is actually my favorite one it's not

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:45.889 
is actually my favorite one it's not
used<00:00:43.260> very<00:00:43.410> much<00:00:43.860> but<00:00:44.280> I<00:00:44.420> recommended<00:00:45.420> I<00:00:45.539> think

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
used very much but I recommended I think

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:49.369 
used very much but I recommended I think
it's<00:00:46.020> really<00:00:46.289> good<00:00:46.550> it's<00:00:47.550> a<00:00:47.820> it's<00:00:48.329> a<00:00:48.870> very

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
it's really good it's a it's a very

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.459 
it's really good it's a it's a very
defensive<00:00:50.070> move<00:00:50.879> set<00:00:51.239> you<00:00:51.809> want<00:00:52.020> a<00:00:52.050> careful

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:52.469 
defensive move set you want a careful

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.290 
defensive move set you want a careful
nature<00:00:52.860> that's<00:00:53.309> high<00:00:53.520> special<00:00:53.940> defense<00:00:54.180> a

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
nature that's high special defense a

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.750 
nature that's high special defense a
little<00:00:54.449> special<00:00:54.690> attack<00:00:55.079> you<00:00:56.070> got<00:00:56.219> blazed<00:00:56.520> and

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
little special attack you got blazed and

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.099 
little special attack you got blazed and
then<00:00:56.879> you<00:00:56.969> have<00:00:57.059> a<00:00:57.120> chest<00:00:57.329> over<00:00:57.719> you<00:00:57.960> know

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
then you have a chest over you know

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.979 
then you have a chest over you know
you'll<00:00:58.590> see<00:00:58.800> why<00:00:58.949> in<00:00:58.980> a<00:00:59.129> second<00:00:59.719> you<00:01:00.719> can<00:01:00.840> put

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
you'll see why in a second you can put

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.900 
you'll see why in a second you can put
250<00:01:01.500> to<00:01:01.649> an<00:01:01.739> HP<00:01:02.100> you're<00:01:02.250> going<00:01:02.370> to<00:01:02.430> max<00:01:02.670> out

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
250 to an HP you're going to max out

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.130 
250 to an HP you're going to max out
make<00:01:03.359> this<00:01:03.510> HP<00:01:03.809> huge<00:01:04.909> put<00:01:05.909> 56<00:01:06.450> in<00:01:06.600> defense<00:01:06.900> to

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
make this HP huge put 56 in defense to

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.530 
make this HP huge put 56 in defense to
make<00:01:07.290> them<00:01:07.500> a<00:01:08.130> little<00:01:08.580> more<00:01:08.700> defensive<00:01:08.970> and

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
make them a little more defensive and

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:10.880 
make them a little more defensive and
then<00:01:09.689> special<00:01:10.020> defense<00:01:10.380> you're<00:01:10.590> going<00:01:10.710> to<00:01:10.770> put

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
then special defense you're going to put

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.929 
then special defense you're going to put
200<00:01:11.430> in<00:01:11.549> so<00:01:12.740> even<00:01:13.740> though<00:01:13.799> he<00:01:13.979> only<00:01:14.010> is<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.430> 65

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
200 in so even though he only is the 65

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.700 
200 in so even though he only is the 65
defense<00:01:15.390> by<00:01:15.630> putting<00:01:15.810> those<00:01:16.049> in<00:01:16.290> there<00:01:16.439> you're

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
defense by putting those in there you're

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.090 
defense by putting those in there you're
definitely<00:01:16.920> helping<00:01:17.820> its<00:01:18.030> defense<00:01:18.330> out<00:01:18.509> a<00:01:18.540> lot

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
definitely helping its defense out a lot

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.830 
definitely helping its defense out a lot
as<00:01:20.100> for<00:01:20.400> moves<00:01:20.640> you<00:01:20.790> got<00:01:20.820> bulk<00:01:21.180> up<00:01:21.390> there<00:01:21.630> and

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840 
as for moves you got bulk up there and

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.090 
as for moves you got bulk up there and
that's<00:01:21.960> why<00:01:22.110> I<00:01:22.140> didn't<00:01:22.380> add<00:01:22.500> that<00:01:22.740> much<00:01:22.890> to

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
that's why I didn't add that much to

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:24.380 
that's why I didn't add that much to
defense<00:01:23.430> because<00:01:23.820> hopefully<00:01:24.000> you'll<00:01:24.240> be<00:01:24.270> able

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
defense because hopefully you'll be able

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.200 
defense because hopefully you'll be able
to<00:01:24.570> bulk<00:01:24.810> up<00:01:24.990> one<00:01:25.290> or<00:01:25.409> two<00:01:25.530> times<00:01:25.740> to<00:01:26.250> brace<00:01:27.030> the

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
to bulk up one or two times to brace the

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.210 
to bulk up one or two times to brace the
defense<00:01:27.540> too<00:01:27.810> and<00:01:28.350> that<00:01:28.439> also<00:01:28.650> raises<00:01:29.130> your

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
defense too and that also raises your

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.390 
defense too and that also raises your
attack<00:01:29.610> so<00:01:30.450> that'll<00:01:31.170> be<00:01:31.290> great<00:01:31.470> for<00:01:32.040> that<00:01:32.070> only

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
attack so that'll be great for that only

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.740 
attack so that'll be great for that only
123<00:01:33.119> power<00:01:33.659> attack<00:01:34.140> will<00:01:34.770> be<00:01:34.950> up<00:01:35.280> even<00:01:35.700> more<00:01:35.880> so

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
123 power attack will be up even more so

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.480 
123 power attack will be up even more so
for<00:01:36.990> attacks<00:01:37.290> you<00:01:37.470> got<00:01:37.650> brick<00:01:37.979> break<00:01:38.250> and

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
for attacks you got brick break and

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.240 
for attacks you got brick break and
Flame<00:01:38.790> Charge<00:01:38.820> Brick<00:01:39.630> Break<00:01:39.659> is<00:01:40.049> a<00:01:40.079> nice<00:01:40.619> solid

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
Flame Charge Brick Break is a nice solid

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:43.639 
Flame Charge Brick Break is a nice solid
fighting<00:01:41.820> move<00:01:42.000> if<00:01:42.240> you<00:01:42.990> don't<00:01:43.170> mind<00:01:43.350> lowering

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
fighting move if you don't mind lowering

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.560 
fighting move if you don't mind lowering
his<00:01:44.130> speed<00:01:44.520> then<00:01:44.880> you<00:01:45.060> could<00:01:45.210> always<00:01:45.329> do

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
his speed then you could always do

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.899 
his speed then you could always do
hammer<00:01:45.840> arm<00:01:46.140> but<00:01:47.070> it's<00:01:47.250> going<00:01:47.369> to<00:01:47.430> contradict

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
hammer arm but it's going to contradict

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.880 
hammer arm but it's going to contradict
the<00:01:48.060> next<00:01:48.299> move<00:01:48.479> which<00:01:48.720> splain<00:01:49.140> charge<00:01:49.560> and

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
the next move which splain charge and

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.740 
the next move which splain charge and
that<00:01:50.189> does<00:01:50.610> up<00:01:50.820> your<00:01:51.060> speed<00:01:51.360> and<00:01:51.390> that's

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
that does up your speed and that's

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.480 
that does up your speed and that's
pretty<00:01:52.079> much<00:01:52.200> life<00:01:52.560> there<00:01:52.590> it's<00:01:53.040> a<00:01:53.070> good<00:01:53.220> fire

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490 
pretty much life there it's a good fire

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.450 
pretty much life there it's a good fire
move<00:01:53.790> but<00:01:54.570> mainly<00:01:55.530> it<00:01:55.799> ups<00:01:55.950> your<00:01:56.159> speed<00:01:56.430> and

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:56.460

00:02:12.979 --> 00:02:12.989 
that Chester berry so that's that move

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:14.110 
that Chester berry so that's that move
set<00:02:13.230> for

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.120 
set for

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:20.150 
set for
the<00:02:15.120> next<00:02:15.390> one<00:02:15.569> is<00:02:15.780> a<00:02:16.730> kind<00:02:17.730> of<00:02:17.819> mixed<00:02:18.590> em<00:02:19.590> Bor

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:20.160 
the next one is a kind of mixed em Bor

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:22.370 
the next one is a kind of mixed em Bor
that's<00:02:20.459> it's<00:02:20.730> what<00:02:21.030> I<00:02:21.060> did<00:02:21.360> first<00:02:21.840> when<00:02:22.050> I<00:02:22.140> went

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
that's it's what I did first when I went

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:26.780 
that's it's what I did first when I went
through<00:02:22.530> the<00:02:22.620> game<00:02:23.600> he<00:02:24.600> has<00:02:24.750> blazed<00:02:25.580> and<00:02:26.580> it's

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
through the game he has blazed and it's

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:28.309 
through the game he has blazed and it's
going<00:02:26.880> to<00:02:26.940> be<00:02:27.030> holding<00:02:27.209> a<00:02:27.480> quick<00:02:27.810> call<00:02:28.050> to<00:02:28.230> make

00:02:28.309 --> 00:02:28.319 
going to be holding a quick call to make

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:31.729 
going to be holding a quick call to make
them<00:02:28.500> faster<00:02:28.980> we<00:02:29.490> got<00:02:29.640> to<00:02:29.819> 52<00:02:30.450> in<00:02:30.720> HP<00:02:31.319> and<00:02:31.590> then

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739 
them faster we got to 52 in HP and then

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:33.770 
them faster we got to 52 in HP and then
128<00:02:32.370> in<00:02:32.520> both<00:02:32.700> attack<00:02:33.000> and<00:02:33.209> special<00:02:33.540> attacks

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
128 in both attack and special attacks

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.110 
128 in both attack and special attacks
so<00:02:34.110> those<00:02:34.319> kind<00:02:34.680> of<00:02:34.800> even<00:02:35.610> out<00:02:35.760> as<00:02:35.940> much<00:02:36.060> as

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
so those kind of even out as much as

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.360 
so those kind of even out as much as
possible<00:02:36.739> as<00:02:37.739> four<00:02:37.950> moves<00:02:38.160> you<00:02:38.340> got

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
possible as four moves you got

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.460 
possible as four moves you got
flamethrower<00:02:39.060> grass<00:02:39.420> not<00:02:39.690> stone<00:02:40.080> edge<00:02:40.290> at

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
flamethrower grass not stone edge at

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:43.130 
flamethrower grass not stone edge at
hammer<00:02:40.770> arm<00:02:41.040> to<00:02:41.850> special<00:02:42.270> moves<00:02:42.480> to<00:02:42.690> physical

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
hammer arm to special moves to physical

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.410 
hammer arm to special moves to physical
moves<00:02:43.350> and<00:02:43.650> they<00:02:43.739> pretty<00:02:43.920> much<00:02:44.010> cover<00:02:44.370> a<00:02:44.520> lot<00:02:45.090> a

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
moves and they pretty much cover a lot a

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.110 
moves and they pretty much cover a lot a
lot<00:02:45.480> of<00:02:45.900> things<00:02:46.080> so<00:02:46.980> that<00:02:47.160> would<00:02:47.310> be<00:02:47.340> the<00:02:47.640> solid

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
lot of things so that would be the solid

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.350 
lot of things so that would be the solid
attacker<00:02:48.450> i'd<00:02:48.660> recommend<00:02:49.140> year<00:02:49.350> and<00:02:50.360> then

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.360 
attacker i'd recommend year and then

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:59.660 
attacker i'd recommend year and then
lastly<00:02:51.959> we<00:02:52.590> have<00:02:53.150> a<00:02:54.350> very<00:02:55.730> physical<00:02:58.160> m<00:02:59.160> board

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
lastly we have a very physical m board

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.210 
lastly we have a very physical m board
that<00:02:59.940> is<00:02:59.970> ready<00:03:00.300> to<00:03:00.630> attack<00:03:01.620> that<00:03:01.860> stopped

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
that is ready to attack that stopped

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.449 
that is ready to attack that stopped
even<00:03:03.030> to<00:03:03.300> its<00:03:03.450> death<00:03:03.920> so<00:03:04.920> we're<00:03:05.130> going<00:03:05.220> to<00:03:05.310> do

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
even to its death so we're going to do

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:08.479 
even to its death so we're going to do
an<00:03:05.640> animal<00:03:06.120> nature<00:03:06.739> with<00:03:07.739> blaze<00:03:08.040> and<00:03:08.370> this

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
an animal nature with blaze and this

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:10.759 
an animal nature with blaze and this
time<00:03:08.730> leftovers<00:03:09.540> we're<00:03:10.440> going<00:03:10.560> to<00:03:10.620> give<00:03:10.739> them

00:03:10.759 --> 00:03:10.769 
time leftovers we're going to give them

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:15.410 
time leftovers we're going to give them
to<00:03:11.040> 52<00:03:11.610> at<00:03:11.790> HP<00:03:12.560> 252<00:03:13.560> an<00:03:13.709> attack<00:03:14.069> and<00:03:14.459> i<00:03:15.269> would

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
to 52 at HP 252 an attack and i would

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:18.470 
to 52 at HP 252 an attack and i would
throw<00:03:15.569> for<00:03:15.959> in<00:03:16.290> defense<00:03:16.739> there<00:03:17.100> so<00:03:18.090> if<00:03:18.239> moves

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480 
throw for in defense there so if moves

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:20.150 
throw for in defense there so if moves
are<00:03:18.690> going<00:03:18.810> to<00:03:18.870> be<00:03:18.959> wild<00:03:19.260> charge<00:03:19.590> which<00:03:19.950> does

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
are going to be wild charge which does

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.090 
are going to be wild charge which does
recoil<00:03:20.640> head<00:03:21.000> smash<00:03:21.360> was<00:03:21.570> just<00:03:21.810> recoil<00:03:22.440> flare

recoil head smash was just recoil flare
blitz<00:03:23.370> which<00:03:23.610> does<00:03:23.820> recoil<00:03:24.360> and<00:03:24.630> then<00:03:25.200> either

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
blitz which does recoil and then either

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.440 
blitz which does recoil and then either
break<00:03:25.769> Brick<00:03:26.310> Break<00:03:26.340> or<00:03:26.700> hammer<00:03:26.970> arm<00:03:27.239> which
