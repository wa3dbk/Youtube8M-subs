00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.949
 the special of four thousand inscribed them 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:27.570
 go through good things and only because it's going to be 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:29.580
 a novelty for the channel is first a 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.500
 pocket when we make and go 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.930
 make a blow here to camp 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:37.160
 microphone that we decided to invest 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.780
 on the channel here and I'll open the vase here 

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:42.030
 very big because it has a pedestal here 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.489
 but I'll simplify cutting 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:46.680
 what to see where each component 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.300
 This is a good sound, I'll show the photo. 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.050
 more cool than your death does not like 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.219
 can not be because only a support 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:01:17.060
 that want to see that my life in which 

00:00:53.219 --> 00:01:17.060
 I make a team turn 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.170
 maybe here some are seeing already have a 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:34.210
 here his component thinks here to 

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:36.820
 you will see that it is the cope filter nÃ© 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:42.570
 it is what filters voice which is one in one 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:42.570
 console access to the microphone to the arcane 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:02:00.430
 not to cut anything do not know how to tone 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:10.140
 General is a filter to stay with less 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:10.140
 Noise beauty but with going back ok 

00:02:14.940 --> 00:03:04.989
 such better than the camera already position here 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:03:14.100
 best microphone camera in hand and already 

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:14.100
 We'll be back soon, we'll be back. 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.620

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:44.990
 not enough a microphone still in the 

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:47.030
 travel has some instructions when reading 

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:50.330
 some things for us to see the 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:51.980
 Microphone is all ok but from 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:52.970
 from here, and there are some 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:55.250
 questions that people can understand 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:58.940
 beauty has also just a purse 

00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:01.040

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:06.290
 It's considered the return for us to see the 

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:08.030
 return of our legal microphone from 

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:10.690
 mask because often dots 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:15.950
 a bag is really cool to save and 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:17.780
 reminder and also a personal filter 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:20.359
 vodka and boot to a microphone 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:22.520
 to avoid noise is already legal 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:23.800
 Too much when you do not have a filter. 

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:26.420

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:29.450

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.970

00:04:56.570 --> 00:05:03.230
 You're there, too heavy to know. 

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:08.210

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:29.270

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:49.100
