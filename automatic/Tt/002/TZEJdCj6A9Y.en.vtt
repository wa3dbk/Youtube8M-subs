and what I'm doing there I'm doing up
for<00:01:18.630> for<00:01:18.869> time<00:01:19.110> doing<00:01:19.830> a<00:01:19.979> down<00:01:20.330> down<00:01:21.439> then<00:01:22.439> I

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
for for time doing a down down then I

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:34.140 
for for time doing a down down then I
miss<00:01:22.860> the<00:01:23.159> strings<00:01:23.520> on<00:01:23.909> the<00:01:24.060> third<00:01:24.299> beat<00:01:24.479> down

one two three four one two three four

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.830 
one two three four one two three four
and<00:01:42.760> the<00:01:43.760> next<00:01:43.970> chord<00:01:44.180> I'm<00:01:44.270> going<00:01:44.390> to<00:01:44.450> use<00:01:44.540> is<00:01:44.810> a

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
and the next chord I'm going to use is a

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.980 
and the next chord I'm going to use is a
C<00:01:45.170> at<00:01:45.320> 9<00:01:45.590> and<00:01:45.890> that<00:01:46.430> is<00:01:46.730> just<00:01:47.030> moving<00:01:47.720> your

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:47.990 
C at 9 and that is just moving your

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:49.719 
C at 9 and that is just moving your
second<00:01:48.380> or<00:01:48.470> first<00:01:48.680> finger<00:01:48.950> down<00:01:49.130> to<00:01:49.460> the

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:49.729 
second or first finger down to the

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:53.770 
second or first finger down to the
fourth<00:01:50.120> and<00:01:50.360> fifth<00:01:51.110> string<00:01:51.440> here<00:01:52.660> so<00:01:53.660> it's

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
fourth and fifth string here so it's

00:01:53.780 --> 00:02:02.040 
fourth and fifth string here so it's
just<00:01:53.840> two<00:01:54.140> chords<00:01:54.470> back<00:01:55.460> and<00:01:55.640> forth<00:01:57.220> now

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:02.050 

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:09.400 

switch

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:09.410 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.840 

and<00:02:10.410> I<00:02:10.620> want<00:02:10.800> to<00:02:10.830> say<00:02:10.980> one<00:02:11.160> thing<00:02:11.190> when<00:02:11.700> you

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:22.560 
strings and just hit open strings but

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.400

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
C at nine these two fingers stay

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.810 
C at nine these two fingers stay
stationary<00:02:28.280> so<00:02:29.280> I'm<00:02:29.340> just<00:02:29.460> going<00:02:29.610> to<00:02:29.670> take

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:29.820 
stationary so I'm just going to take

00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:36.220 
stationary so I'm just going to take
these<00:02:30.030> two<00:02:30.090> off<00:02:30.650> now<00:02:31.650> known<00:02:32.580> this<00:02:33.450> down<00:02:34.440> off

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230 
these two off now known this down off

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:53.960 
these two off now known this down off
let<00:02:37.230> me<00:02:37.320> switch<00:02:51.620> another<00:02:52.620> example<00:02:53.130> if<00:02:53.400> I'm

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
let me switch another example if I'm

00:02:53.970 --> 00:03:00.110 
let me switch another example if I'm
just<00:02:54.150> doing<00:02:54.570> an<00:02:54.690> e-minor<00:02:57.110> to<00:02:58.110> this<00:02:58.320> uh<00:02:59.030> it's<00:03:00.030> a

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
just doing an e-minor to this uh it's a

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:05.630 
just doing an e-minor to this uh it's a
d6<00:03:00.840> add<00:03:01.850> B<00:03:02.850> slash<00:03:03.810> f-sharp<00:03:04.340> just<00:03:05.340> think<00:03:05.520> of<00:03:05.610> it

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:05.640 
d6 add B slash f-sharp just think of it

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.380 
d6 add B slash f-sharp just think of it
as<00:03:05.760> a<00:03:05.820> homemade<00:03:06.240> chord

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:08.390 
as a homemade chord

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:10.570 
as a homemade chord
is<00:03:08.720> usually<00:03:09.200> you'll<00:03:09.470> find<00:03:09.500> in<00:03:09.920> and<00:03:10.069> I<00:03:10.100> find

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:10.580 
is usually you'll find in and I find

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:13.150 
is usually you'll find in and I find
this<00:03:10.700> in<00:03:10.819> a<00:03:10.880> chord<00:03:11.150> but<00:03:11.420> and<00:03:11.770> this<00:03:12.770> one's<00:03:13.010> going

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:13.160 
this in a chord but and this one's going

00:03:13.160 --> 00:03:16.860 
this in a chord but and this one's going
to<00:03:13.250> go<00:03:13.400> a<00:03:13.580> minor

00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:16.870 

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:24.449 

switched<00:03:17.410> to<00:03:17.769> six

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:24.459 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:26.580

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:29.170 
said about hitting the open strings I'm

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:32.440 
said about hitting the open strings I'm
going<00:03:29.319> to<00:03:29.379> go<00:03:29.500> down

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:32.450 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:37.710 

take<00:03:33.450> your<00:03:33.599> hand<00:03:33.840> off<00:03:34.019> if<00:03:34.739> the<00:03:35.069> trebles<00:03:35.549> open

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:43.840 

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:57.490 

now<00:03:46.270> off

and<00:03:58.500> that<00:03:59.220> is<00:03:59.490> the<00:03:59.820> secret<00:04:00.030> of<00:04:00.390> switching

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
and that is the secret of switching

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:03.470 
and that is the secret of switching
chords<00:04:01.170> hit<00:04:01.410> open<00:04:01.920> strings<00:04:02.340> because<00:04:03.060> going

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
chords hit open strings because going

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:15.010 
chords hit open strings because going
say<00:04:04.050> here's<00:04:04.200> another<00:04:04.410> example

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:15.020 

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:24.240 

you

so<00:04:25.250> let<00:04:25.490> me<00:04:25.580> go<00:04:25.760> over<00:04:25.880> that<00:04:25.940> again<00:04:26.090> you're

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:26.630 
so let me go over that again you're

00:04:26.630 --> 00:04:33.640 
so let me go over that again you're
beginning<00:04:27.410> with<00:04:27.560> the<00:04:27.650> G<00:04:27.860> chord

00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:33.650 

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:40.580 

No
