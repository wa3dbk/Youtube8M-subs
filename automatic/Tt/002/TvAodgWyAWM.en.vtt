00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.589
 hello to your pumba and we continue 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.810
 No, we do not continue the schedule box 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:09.480
 as you can see on my fps counter 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.840
 very big lags don't know what it is 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:14.639
 connected to the computer i haven't changed 

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:16.199
 even who is this then leave 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.539
 constantly here are such suspensions 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:21.060
 which was just subject to 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.310
 that my settings are low 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.930
 possible so I have tried to say 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.609
 turn off staggering while running 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:28.760
 however, the signing remains but they 

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:30.990
 pass more quickly 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:34.010
 i just don't know what to do with it 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.210
 I know what to do with him already 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.590
 I just don't know what to do with these. 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.300
 the logs there are some five countries about 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:43.559
 purse want to know who it was then 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:45.090
 about hung okay and such 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.210
 signing very often therefore not even 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.250
 know what to do with it i'm going to 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.770
 stop but recognize books not yet 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:56.910
 there will be a more stable version in which 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:01:01.649
 u less salagi hope so long i will 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:09.420
 wait yes what is that with 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:10.880
 I tune it so you go to the Lord 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.070
 channel let me finish 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.900
 But in general, while we wait for this new 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.210
 box version though I don't think sheâ€™s 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:21.360
 will be released soon as an option 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:25.020
 you can play magic world is one of 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:27.360
 mod pack of feet the best voucher but who is not 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.740
 knows can write in Yandex or in 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.420
 Google who uses what I start 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.090
 I use the index here I can through 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:36.150
 fence jump 35 jump well in general it 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:37.619
 as you already understood the magic assembly but I 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.799
 I will rely not so much on the magic 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.840
 fashion but as you can see with this just 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.090
 impossible to play and I'm going to add 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.729
 a couple more term mods such already 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.869
 the famous millenaire me unfortunately 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.270
 as you know, you will have to change 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.770
 since other natural modes are not 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:55.110
 once and the other way there is another mod 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.719
 extra beat and adds a bunch of new 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:58.979
 gnomes are fun those who are there 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:01.079
 industrial fashion cost such as 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.649
 forestry build craft I perhaps turn off 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:06.540
 as they are I do not need the more 

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:08.610
 if I want to do more or less 

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.649
 south- like god 100 industrial 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.430
 There should be no mods at all 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:16.920
 about tom kraft he's there for the third version 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:18.599
 what's cool and what's not cool at the same time 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.819
 as I have for the new 

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:23.849
 to understand that craft and lucky again 

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:25.319
 But no, not for a while, although of course you 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:28.220
 can you give me your options 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:31.799
 or provide your magic builds 

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:35.430
 In general, I will wait for your suggestions 

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:36.900
 your comments about this are not 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:38.970
 I need to write here how to change 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:42.390
 logs and even people I already wrote and 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:44.120
 repeated as you can see does not help with 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:47.340
 one side even got stronger 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:51.120
 Yes, most likely this is what I have on 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:53.159
 computer 32-bit system though 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:56.849
 most likely it is that there is not a computer 

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:58.799
 weak like and say that all 4 64 

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:01.040
 bit system it is stronger 32 bit and 

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:04.230
 there you can use more 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:06.269
 opportunity computer but i'm lazy 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:09.599
 reinstall windows even for her sake 

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:11.939
 boxing okay fixed the house on let's all 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:18.560
 here are already finished guys i 

00:03:11.939 --> 00:03:21.269
 waiting for your suggestions and hung okay 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:23.970
 I hope all the same you will be for this assembly 

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:26.599
 magic world is on minecraft version 146 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:29.069
 and I personally liked it 

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:31.019
 at least I wo n't have to cheat a lot 

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:33.090
 but still standing there but wanna fight of 

00:03:31.019 --> 00:03:35.790
 so I will find out very successfully 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:37.620
 craft and although take into account what is there and how 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:39.870
 and again, the new unknown is not 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:41.840
 Tom Kraft mechanics there generally completely 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:44.099
 changed that is i will be a complete noob 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.540
 but on the other hand it will be more interesting 

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:46.890
 celebrate new 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.170
 Although it is a pity that I did not reach here 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:50.010
 twentieth level to 25 level got 

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:52.680
 still heart 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:54.829
 but oh well oh well wait for your 

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.829
 offers
