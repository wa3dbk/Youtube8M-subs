00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:06.470
 hello everyone I'm craft mails from the 

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:09.830
 city ​​of mexico I'm technical girls and 

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:11.869
 manicurist for more than 15 years and 

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:15.590
 Today I wanted to share with you in this my 

00:00:11.869 --> 00:00:17.890
 first video on how to apply these 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:20.780
 beautiful decorations that were given to 

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:25.340
 instant neil fashion in 10 minutes of 

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:27.890
 republic there are many brands that handle 

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:30.530
 the same type of product is a sticker 

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:34.310
 nest antilles covering the entire plate 

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:35.840
 of the girl and basically apply from 

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:38.710
 the same way 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:41.739
 limaj the surface of the nail 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:45.730
 if you remove the powder you apply and 

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:48.399
 supposedly last more than 10 days what 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:50.800
 which is a bit unlikely since 

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:54.250
 it's absolutely absolutely a stamp 

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:56.019
 It's a sticker and well, the nail 

00:00:54.250 --> 00:01:00.280
 Although the dehydration is the nail 

00:00:56.019 --> 00:01:02.589
 tends to rehydrate grows and 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:05.440
 good is factors that cause 

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:07.960
 lifting whether you wear acrylic 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:10.119
 causes equal acrylic lifting 

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:12.340
 causes enamel lifting and for 

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:14.080
 the same also of this kind of 

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.840
 stamp 

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:19.660
 There are many brands in the US market 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:22.360
 but they are very difficult to find 

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:25.990
 here in Mexico or if you find them not 

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:28.600
 they have the product available they have 12 

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:32.410
 but not all the variety that is handled 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:35.430
 already here also good I found some 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:39.250
 from my a secret but that are total 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:41.710
 totally a stamp are a stick and 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:44.530
 well this is from what I have seen here 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:48.550
 on YouTube these are more like those of 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:52.900
 Broadway that are very thin are 

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:56.770
 very cute very thin guy what 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:59.820
 they call an epoxy sticker that has 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:03.970
 it comes as that with greater adhesion 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:06.970
 well then this does not guarantee us a 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:09.840
 little more durability than a 

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:16.560
 stamp than a standard sticker 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:20.879
 in English to what we have not be wars 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:23.790
 instant is ok, I opened my little package 

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:26.549
 I was applying two and the truth 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.940
 good of the method that I have followed has not 

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:33.480
 noticed it took about two hours 

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:36.300
 with the sticker already applied by state 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:38.250
 and it's good to go down to wash the dishes 

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:42.060
 I've been doing one of several things 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:43.710
 cleaning here in the house and good so 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.010
 soon they have not risen I have not 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:49.590
 put nothing the only thing I did was 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:54.080
 apply a kind since good now my 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:56.360
 I bring these nails very short 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:59.230
 he wanted it good that they did it a little 

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:59.230
 more decorations 

00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:04.630
 What I did was apply the kit 

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:12.129
 at a 45 degree angle with your 

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:15.069
 light glue or resin on the part of 

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:19.989
 the eyelash or at a 45 degree angle 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:22.810
 to avoid bubbles and that when it comes to 

00:03:19.989 --> 00:03:27.480
 filing the union the bubbles cause 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:27.480
 that the good nail tends to fall 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:31.750
 so what he did was to vanish the 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:37.800
 Union 

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:37.800
 push cuticle remove the receipt 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:48.390
 that remains when pushing the pterygium 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:48.390
 I removed it with a professional scalpel 

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:55.870
 file down towards me so 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:04:00.050
 if you say you're doing your nails 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:02.510
 from Lima to you 

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:06.800
 so that to open what is called 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:10.400
 adhesion channels and that your manicure 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:13.760
 your nails your decoration will last a little 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:17.090
 more here we do not apply any kind of 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:21.260
 adhesive or liquid to help us 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:23.330
 to ensure greater durability of the 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:25.700
 product because because we will have another 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:29.320
 Once moisturize the nail and therefore 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:31.990
 is going to raise the sticker 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:34.120
 So these are very parents because 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:38.260
 How is the form transparent? 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:41.070
 Easily check the size of stickers 

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:41.070
 what's best for you 

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:50.009
 Many brands recommend that you wear 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:52.190
 the speaker and that eliminate the excess 

00:04:50.009 --> 00:04:54.080
 with a limit 

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:55.730
 and I recommend the ones that come 

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.410
 packets because they are not what 

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:59.510
 strong enough to 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:02.500
 take the sticker with a single pull 

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:06.130
 and you have to be the email email and I 

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:09.580
 I recommend cutting it as long as you 

00:05:06.130 --> 00:05:12.669
 help with a pair of tweezers 

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:15.729
 to prevent grease with your oils 

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:20.319
 natural the stamp and also you 

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:22.870
 remove that injury I'm going to withdraw good 

00:05:20.319 --> 00:05:24.460
 I 'm going to measure myself here 1 apologize 

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:27.669
 angle of the camera but if it's a bit 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:31.630
 complicated for me right now look this is 

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:35.670
 the one who has the most left girls 

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:41.540
 to check to measure how far 

00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:41.540
 more or less this girl and I'm going to cut 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:56.300
 the scissors I press to be able to cut 

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:56.300
 the sticker and remove it to be able to apply
