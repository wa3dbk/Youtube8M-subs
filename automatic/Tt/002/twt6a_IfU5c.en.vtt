00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:07.980
 following the attacks on samsung 

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.290
 galaxy note in 8 inch format 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:13.320
 so we wanted to focus on 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.610
 the use of the stylus that is housed here 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.120
 as I see in the previous 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.279
 video 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.650
 when you trigger the stylus you 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.119
 see there is a whole series 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:23.490
 of applications that is set up here 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.320
 so that's great so these famous 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.820
 style and so this is called the 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.980
 Context menus segment 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.359
 so I'll make you see on by 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.009
 example a video so it's enough 

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.960
 blatant 

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:36.750
 for example I'm launching this video you to 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.460
 see so it's a movie here I put the 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.700
 stylus like this you see I move 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:45.390
 just like that and I can see it scroll 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:49.500
 without touching the tablet since samsung 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:52.940
 call the context menu if I go there 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:56.190
 go live I just press it 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:59.280
 this is a little gadget among so many 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.539
 others on the style part is what 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.629
 I wanted to make you see especially 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:05.640
 it was the note taking part so 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.540
 all those who have a galaxy note are going 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.700
 know and recognize 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:14.050
 these apps there so this is the 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:17.320
 part note that samsung offers you i 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:25.870
 click on it I'm doing I'm going on it 

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:27.850
 and I will then be able to do a 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:35.050
 reactive point of view it's very very 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:39.130
 well see tablets really wrote 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:41.500
 perfectly and its restitutes wheat 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.180
 correctly what you want 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.490
 write so for note-taking this is 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:48.960
 perfect i'll just do a test 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:51.040
 with the pen to make you see see 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.020
 it's still not bad in terms of 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.930
 reactivity is not bad at all me 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.759
 I was really amazed 

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.259
 just as well as the galaxy note 2 in 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:01.920
 terms of responsiveness it's really very 

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:05.140
 well at that level then differently 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:07.479
 another nice little thing here you 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:09.580
 have the little bar that allows you 

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:11.440
 to have just a double screen and 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:14.019
 decree heard for example I 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:18.970
 selected the calendar that I want to me 

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:20.830
 see show game the record like this and 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.410
 I want to add 1 2 there is a second 

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:26.470
 support I support there and that's it and so here we 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:33.640
 is found directly after day 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:36.700
 so redo there we end up with the 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:39.850
 two apps at the same time I think pretty 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.739
 polaris and for all that is work 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:44.650
 and where it really is the practice can 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:46.060
 put as if like this you see 

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.590
 after you can work while 

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:48.790
 having access to other applications in 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.730
 same time from where could put it with 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:53.200
 a video with music here with 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:55.750
 a web page is really hyper 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:58.150
 practice for murderers just 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:00.010
 go back like these a 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.290
 other little app that I'm drunk we 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:05.530
 always offers a boredom in addition 

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:07.600
 style and that is hd notes is 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.970
 the hd2 application 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:13.390
 of taking notes so the same you 

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:14.980
 have note-taking templates 

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:17.410
 which are directly the so you have 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:20.260
 travel journal for example diary so 

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:22.690
 it's your personal diary of ideas from 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:24.220
 work here you press like this 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:27.040
 you have a model directly that is 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:29.050
 here and there after you just need to 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.690
 directly to write about it as 

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:33.280
 this is the same so it's 

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:34.720
 models so it is not too bad eh it 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.700
 allows you to have two to have 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:38.350
 other ideas for your note taking 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:41.290
 can also assume to do 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:45.130
 directly your email here if he wants 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:46.900
 well smile here so here I can 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:49.000
 write directly a mail then be 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:51.580
 with the stylus always be with the 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.650
 keyboard that you do not know if you 

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:57.220
 have one of a samsung product 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:59.590
 so that's the last thing 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:00.460
 that I want to see with the stylus it's 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:02.620
 by an artist 

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:04.630
 so that's pretty cool so that's 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:06.820
 the more we will say it's not really stylish 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:08.260
 it's more at first to 

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:11.050
 take pictures for example so there 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:13.240
 I put a picture you see I do if 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:15.850
 you see well but it gives you 

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:18.580
 effects that you put directly on 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:19.989
 your photo pl I selected is 

00:04:18.580 --> 00:04:23.050
 to elect full of effects has yielded enough 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:26.650
 nice and after you can rework 

00:04:23.050 --> 00:04:29.680
 this photo with your stylus we play 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:30.690
 make them scroll a little everything you 

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:32.620
 realize 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:34.450
 once you have taken the picture 

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:36.790
 you can rework after the la 

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:38.290
 photo with the stylus which gives us 

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:39.670
 really in terms of creativity if you 

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:42.000
 bust into the design and all that can be 

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:44.350
 to practice these practices 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.640
 that's the effects we have 

00:04:44.350 --> 00:04:47.820
 know a little bit everything if we use 

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:51.130
 photoshop 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:53.350
 So that's a little a little 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:55.030
 tool called exactly paper 

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:56.830
 artists so this is a tool a 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:59.530
 application that samsung offers us 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:01.750
 with so that's so it was just a 

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:04.510
 little focus on the stylus part that is 

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:05.740
 really super convenient and who still has 

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:07.060
 a whole lot of other features 

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:08.380
 but there are so many that I confess 

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:10.420
 that it's going to be complicated of all you 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:11.820
 list because really there for the 

00:05:10.420 --> 00:05:13.860
 blow samsung 

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:16.130
 saw very good for for using the 

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:16.130
 stiletto
