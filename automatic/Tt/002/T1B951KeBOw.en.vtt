00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:06.070
 I dont know 

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:06.070
 ah 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:16.009
 well this will be short because the truth 

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:18.560
 it's not worth wasting much 

00:00:16.009 --> 00:00:21.079
 time in this when they canceled the 

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:23.390
 spectacular spiderman for the purchase of 

00:00:21.079 --> 00:00:25.669
 disney to marvel at first the 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:27.590
 disney bastards said it was 

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:30.110
 because they did not want to have the same 

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:32.870
 product competing in that sense 

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:35.090
 sounds logical but the truth is this 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:38.000
 now it 's a product disney has to 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:40.160
 See yourself as such since cancellation I 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:43.219
 I had the worst thing in fact in a video 

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:45.409
 last I said it or something like admit that 

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:47.719
 after how good I thought it was 

00:00:45.409 --> 00:00:50.239
 the avengers the most egotistical heroes 

00:00:47.719 --> 00:00:52.789
 of the planet because it will not be perfect but 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:55.190
 it's entertaining that you can tell it's been 

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:57.679
 focused more on the part of the action 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:59.659
 that in an interesting group management and 

00:00:57.679 --> 00:01:01.999
 an accelerated running of events between 

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:04.640
 other failures but in short so I 

00:01:01.999 --> 00:01:07.030
 I expected something similar with this series 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.409
 but they screwed up my face these bastards 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:12.049
 let's start with the first and greatest 

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:14.270
 problem with this thing the name has 

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:16.880
 the nerve to be called ultimate 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:19.430
 spider-man when really is not 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:22.340
 'not any of the material in this comic in 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:24.320
 the comic peter tells mj what is 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.270
 spider-man to avoid breaking the 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.009
 relationship with her because of her 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.170
 constant and badly justified 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:32.450
 disappearances while here they are 

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.970
 friends and even when one year has passed 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:38.090
 as spider-man has not counted between 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:40.579
 another two trillion changes the 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:43.039
 characters have been adapted so 

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:45.200
 horrible to the great mentor and first of all 

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:47.780
 mother who was meh and parker in the 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:50.720
 comics transformed it into a clown 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:53.270
 living devoid of grace and soul alone 

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:55.580
 is there for good or fucking idea 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.590
 I guess they wanted to do a series of 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:02:00.319
 spider-man and she came in the package 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:02.080
 along with Harry the other characters of the 

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:04.670
 comic that I doubt they will have 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:07.189
 relevant participation other great 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.259
 problem is the insult to logic with 

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:11.660
 that big and poorly made blowjob that is the 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:14.329
 training group for superheroes 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:16.670
 in the commit it was clear that fury had 

00:02:14.329 --> 00:02:18.860
 plans for Peter when he fulfilled the 

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.709
 come of age because while outside 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.069
 only a child the laws protected him what 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:25.400
 of 

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:27.739
 It was karol's idea, my marvel but 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.499
 how it happened in the traditional universe with 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:33.049
 I already heart my current avatar for 

00:02:30.499 --> 00:02:35.659
 who do not know her first they asked her for the 

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:38.060
 authorization to his father and in the ultimate 

00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:40.219
 Carol herself convinces May that 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.920
 may not prevent Peter from stopping 

00:02:40.219 --> 00:02:44.420
 do what he considers his 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.459
 responsibility but at least they can 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.010
 prepare it so that they have more chances 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:51.469
 to survive while it is very grosa 

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.780
 Fury series does not force Peter to take the 

00:02:51.469 --> 00:02:56.359
 decision if he allows him to take it for 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:58.790
 yes only which is idiocy from 

00:02:56.359 --> 00:03:01.250
 any point of view there are millions of 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.709
 reasons why leave that decision 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:05.900
 it's a mistake is it does not even try 

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:08.239
 persuade him to stop helping between 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.790
 quotes let's start with the fact that 

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:13.189
 would happen if I died or if he gets hurt between 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:15.709
 other possibilities that were covered in 

00:03:13.189 --> 00:03:18.409
 the comic as the fact protect his 

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:20.329
 family if it was discovered to mention 

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:23.269
 the most important thing here simply 

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:25.849
 they went through the balls like 

00:03:23.269 --> 00:03:27.410
 example give him a motorcycle among other things 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:29.660
 equal of pendejas 

00:03:27.410 --> 00:03:32.180
 in the long run they are only to sell toys 

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:34.790
 of poor quality and do not be fooled of 

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:37.430
 the silly explanation of fury have a 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:40.940
 motorbike jumping from building to building is 

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:43.250
 a stupidity the design of characters is 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:45.500
 Well, although I really do not like 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:47.990
 changes in peter's uniform how 

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:50.420
 Put on gloves by removing the stripes 

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:52.790
 red of the arms and how thin the 

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:55.130
 black edge of the eyes that damage the 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:57.560
 expressions that without mentioning it 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:04:00.170
 unnecessarily robust that I find 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:02.540
 the spectacular respected more the canon 

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:04.730
 of the character not to mention that the 

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:07.310
 movements were more fluid 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:10.070
 the other characters have designs 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:12.590
 pretty the presentation of the series does not 

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:15.260
 I like it is definitely childish with 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:18.290
 unnecessary explanations and effects of 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:19.670
 scandalous sound now all those who 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:21.859
 have seen it they will agree 

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:24.380
 with me in what is the abortion of the 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:27.260
 young titans and young justice a 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:29.510
 American design with Japanese jokes and 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:32.330
 they know about design training and those 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:33.889
 things in short this series is a complete 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:36.560
 had wasted 

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:39.080
 the hand an excellent comic as it is the 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:40.840
 ultimate spider-man so full of ideas 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:43.729
 risky and good development 

00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:45.830
 new and more realistic concepts but 

00:04:43.729 --> 00:04:49.009
 As usual, Disney takes the 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:50.930
 more extravagant and colorful parts as well 

00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:53.060
 as he did in his insipid and 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:55.400
 incoherent movies like sum and those 

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:58.099
 superheroes eat shit and school 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:00.199
 superheroes that by the way is a plagiarism 

00:04:58.099 --> 00:05:02.569
 from an older movie but not 

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:04.849
 I remember his name was from a family of 

00:05:02.569 --> 00:05:07.069
 blacks with powers whose weakness was the 

00:05:04.849 --> 00:05:09.680
 aluminum I know it sounds silly but it's 

00:05:07.069 --> 00:05:11.990
 infinitely better in short with a 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:16.180
 terrible series and a movie that does not 

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:16.180
 I hope nothing good I tell you 

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:25.070
 you take for ass again what 

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:25.070
 is that I buy you
