00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:08.299
 hi friends in this video I'm going to 

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:12.289
 show a tutorial how to do these 

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:14.869
 Crochet hearts are very easy to 

00:00:12.289 --> 00:00:19.400
 make us serve to decorate many 

00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:22.580
 things are super cute and we can 

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:24.919
 help I do not know to do crafts and 

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:28.329
 sell them for me this is a hobby I 

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:31.130
 relaxes a lot then let's start 

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:34.129
 I also want to tell you that the size 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:37.670
 the sizes that you see here are 

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:41.829
 different for two reasons one is for the 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.829
 thickness of the yarn used 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:48.399
 and the other one is for him 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:51.109
 thickness of the hook that we use 

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:53.440
 so for example look at these two are 

00:00:51.109 --> 00:00:57.250
 of different sizes 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:01:00.670
 because of the thickness of the yarn because 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:02.800
 two I made them with this hook and these two 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:05.770
 They are of different sizes and I made them with 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:07.360
 this hook that I do not know if you see it I think that 

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.229
 do not 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:13.350
 that since 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:15.630
 2.7 millimeters is not seen but good with 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.600
 this hook I did these two and with this 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:21.450
 wide I made these two and they change the 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:24.060
 sizes by the thickness of the threads and by 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:27.730
 the hooks then look I have 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:30.010
 very much they become super fast 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:32.350
 I have all the colors many times 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:34.600
 we have yarn that we have bits left over 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:37.660
 of those bits of yarn we can 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:40.060
 make woven hearts and after 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:43.130
 use them in some fun project 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:47.659
 or to work 

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:52.579
 then we are going to need hooks 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:55.969
 this hunger and scissors that is all that 

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:59.810
 we need for example as I have 

00:01:55.969 --> 00:02:02.520
 here my white stamen the truth 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.649
 We can use any thickness 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.700
 It will give us difference in size 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:09.610
 as well 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:12.760
 let's use the white now and this 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:15.910
 white heart I did with this hook 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:18.870
 now so you see the difference I'm going to 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:22.230
 use this hook with the same yarn 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:28.099
 it will be of a larger size 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:28.099
 let's start doing a round like this 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:33.819
 and then we will pass our hook 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:37.469
 In the center 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:37.469
 and we pulled a little 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:44.630
 this is a navel I call or return 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:47.209
 of magnifying glass because when we go doing 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:49.819
 the tissue of this band-aid we will go 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:52.910
 making this circle smaller for 

00:02:49.819 --> 00:02:55.080
 that is tight then you start 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:57.770
 with 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.770
 three chains 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:03.700
 after those three chains we are going to 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:08.750
 make a double crochet that is thus a 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:13.370
 turn another round we bring here 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:17.470
 through the middle we pass and here we go to 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:20.220
 take out the yarn every 2 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:23.240
 these are double crooks 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:23.240
 there is the first 

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:31.020
 let's do 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:31.020
 four double crochet 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:42.220
 I 'm doing it a bit of space 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:46.610
 I think 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:50.380
 but it's so they can go at my pace 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:52.930
 and understand it easily 

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:55.460
 we go three double crochet and we go with the 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:58.040
 quarter 

00:03:55.460 --> 00:04:00.340
 there is 

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:03.280
 the fourth 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:06.160
 optimal bull here ok after this 

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:08.620
 fourth double crochet let's do 3 

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:11.190
 normal twists that is one turn 

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:11.190
 nothing else 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:19.410
 two 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:29.740
 and then we make a chain 

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:29.740
 and a double crochet 

00:04:34.289 --> 00:04:43.289
 and another chain here look, we can go 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:45.559
 pulling and reducing the contour 

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:51.949
 Circle the knot as you want to call it 

00:04:45.559 --> 00:04:51.949
 we make three other normal couples 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:11.289
 there are three normal wands 

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:11.289
 we now make four double crochet 

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:16.460
 this is one 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:20.320
 two 

00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:30.180
 this is the third 

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:41.100
 and the fourth one we almost finished 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:43.560
 then here as you can see it is already grabbing 

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:47.310
 shape 

00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:49.410
 let's close by making 3 chains like 

00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:52.530
 we did at the beginning so it ends 

00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:54.740
 then to finish we passed here the 

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:56.510
 hook 

00:05:54.740 --> 00:06:00.170
 we pull 

00:05:56.510 --> 00:06:02.720
 let's make a slip point here 

00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:08.200
 and since we have that slipped point 

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:08.200
 we grab our little tip from the yarn and 

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:16.889
 we tighten look how it is already closed 

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:19.710
 and to close here or finish 

00:06:16.889 --> 00:06:20.999
 we pull a little bit like we're going to do 

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:25.969
 a chain but it's going to be a point 

00:06:20.999 --> 00:06:30.849
 slipped we cut and we had it like that 

00:06:25.969 --> 00:06:33.750
 now we just press it like this 

00:06:30.849 --> 00:06:37.880
 and can cut 

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:37.880
 your leftovers here 

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:43.360
 another tip that I wanted to give you look what 

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:46.389
 nice stay 

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:49.590
 and there is size difference the same 

00:06:46.389 --> 00:06:52.300
 stamen with two different hooks 

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:53.770
 so we are left with different 

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:55.479
 sizes 

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:58.689
 if you want to cut off the 

00:06:55.479 --> 00:07:01.060
 leftovers can cut you if they want 

00:06:58.689 --> 00:07:04.539
 to leave oneself they can be left to me 

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:07.659
 It happens to me that suddenly we can leave him 

00:07:04.539 --> 00:07:11.319
 the leftovers in case we want to hang them 

00:07:07.659 --> 00:07:13.180
 in something or doing something with what the 

00:07:11.319 --> 00:07:15.069
 Leftovers can help us and not have 

00:07:13.180 --> 00:07:18.250
 that using yarn again is a way 

00:07:15.069 --> 00:07:21.490
 to recycle I hope you liked it 

00:07:18.250 --> 00:07:24.189
 they give me a like below they tell me their 

00:07:21.490 --> 00:07:26.949
 comments I know how to do many things in 

00:07:24.189 --> 00:07:29.800
 crochet I love crafts and 

00:07:26.949 --> 00:07:32.469
 I await your suggestions your comments 

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:34.930
 their likes and we are seeing ourselves here in 

00:07:32.469 --> 00:07:38.099
 the next on this channel they have a 

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:38.099
 cute day chao
