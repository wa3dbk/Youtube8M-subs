00:00:50.909 --> 00:00:54.349 
enough of that we're actually gonna do
the<00:00:51.179> texture<00:00:51.510> pack<00:00:51.659> so<00:00:52.499> it's<00:00:53.100> a<00:00:53.219> 32<00:00:53.699> by<00:00:53.819> 32<00:00:54.089> peck

00:00:54.349 --> 00:00:54.359 
the texture pack so it's a 32 by 32 peck

00:00:54.359 --> 00:00:58.779 
the texture pack so it's a 32 by 32 peck
and<00:00:54.600> it<00:00:54.809> was<00:00:54.960> actually<00:00:55.170> um<00:00:55.999> it<00:00:56.999> was<00:00:57.449> based<00:00:58.139> upon

00:00:58.779 --> 00:00:58.789 
and it was actually um it was based upon

00:00:58.789 --> 00:01:01.639 
and it was actually um it was based upon
Jolie<00:00:59.789> craft<00:01:00.089> which<00:01:00.269> I<00:01:00.389> did<00:01:00.929> a<00:01:00.960> review<00:01:01.589> on

00:01:01.639 --> 00:01:01.649 
Jolie craft which I did a review on

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:04.579 
Jolie craft which I did a review on
previously<00:01:02.280> so<00:01:02.909> basically<00:01:03.569> what<00:01:03.690> 32<00:01:04.049> by<00:01:04.290> 32

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
previously so basically what 32 by 32

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.550 
previously so basically what 32 by 32
means<00:01:05.129> is<00:01:05.430> there<00:01:05.670> are<00:01:05.700> 32<00:01:06.180> pixels<00:01:06.450> by<00:01:07.229> 32

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
means is there are 32 pixels by 32

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.010 
means is there are 32 pixels by 32
pixels<00:01:07.680> and<00:01:08.539> just<00:01:09.539> so<00:01:09.689> you<00:01:09.750> know<00:01:09.840> for

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
pixels and just so you know for

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.620 
pixels and just so you know for
reference<00:01:10.649> the<00:01:11.159> default<00:01:11.460> texture<00:01:11.850> pack<00:01:12.060> is<00:01:12.240> 16

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
reference the default texture pack is 16

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.459 
reference the default texture pack is 16
by<00:01:12.780> 16<00:01:12.840> so<00:01:13.829> you<00:01:13.920> do<00:01:14.340> need<00:01:14.549> mod<00:01:14.960> MC<00:01:15.960> patcher<00:01:16.170> in

00:01:16.459 --> 00:01:16.469 
by 16 so you do need mod MC patcher in

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:19.340 
by 16 so you do need mod MC patcher in
order<00:01:16.710> to<00:01:16.829> use<00:01:17.039> this<00:01:17.250> so<00:01:18.149> let<00:01:18.780> me<00:01:18.840> just<00:01:18.960> do<00:01:19.109> time

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
order to use this so let me just do time

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.819 
order to use this so let me just do time
today<00:01:19.920> and<00:01:20.359> so<00:01:21.359> we'll<00:01:22.170> take<00:01:22.320> a<00:01:22.350> look<00:01:22.530> at<00:01:22.680> the

00:01:22.819 --> 00:01:22.829 
today and so we'll take a look at the

00:01:22.829 --> 00:01:25.789 
today and so we'll take a look at the
love<00:01:23.009> orbiter<00:01:23.460> so<00:01:23.850> um<00:01:24.119> as<00:01:24.600> you<00:01:25.140> guys<00:01:25.289> know<00:01:25.350> and

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
love orbiter so um as you guys know and

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.200 
love orbiter so um as you guys know and
you'll<00:01:25.950> probably<00:01:26.340> hear<00:01:26.609> me<00:01:26.789> I<00:01:26.820> feel<00:01:27.030> like<00:01:27.180> a

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
you'll probably hear me I feel like a

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.069 
you'll probably hear me I feel like a
broken<00:01:27.630> record<00:01:27.899> but<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:29.240> this<00:01:30.240> lava<00:01:30.509> and<00:01:30.869> this

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
broken record but the this lava and this

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:33.919 
broken record but the this lava and this
the<00:01:31.710> water<00:01:31.920> is<00:01:32.070> decent<00:01:32.490> but<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:33.240> lava<00:01:33.600> it<00:01:33.750> just

00:01:33.919 --> 00:01:33.929 
the water is decent but the lava it just

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:35.270 
the water is decent but the lava it just
doesn't<00:01:34.170> look<00:01:34.229> like<00:01:34.409> real<00:01:34.590> lava<00:01:34.859> to<00:01:35.130> me<00:01:35.250> I

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
doesn't look like real lava to me I

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.550 
doesn't look like real lava to me I
think<00:01:35.429> the<00:01:35.670> only<00:01:35.700> real<00:01:36.149> lava<00:01:36.450> is<00:01:36.750> dokucraft

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
think the only real lava is dokucraft

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.230 
think the only real lava is dokucraft
and<00:01:38.009> that's<00:01:38.130> because<00:01:38.250> it<00:01:38.490> has<00:01:38.640> rocks<00:01:38.969> in<00:01:39.149> it

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
and that's because it has rocks in it

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.450 
and that's because it has rocks in it
and<00:01:39.500> that's<00:01:40.500> what<00:01:40.560> love<00:01:40.799> really<00:01:41.070> looks<00:01:41.369> like

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
and that's what love really looks like

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.940 
and that's what love really looks like
to<00:01:41.729> me<00:01:41.759> this<00:01:42.240> law<00:01:42.390> much<00:01:42.600> does<00:01:42.899> just<00:01:43.560> looks<00:01:43.740> fake

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:43.950 
to me this law much does just looks fake

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:47.029 
to me this law much does just looks fake
but<00:01:44.700> um<00:01:44.880> my<00:01:45.509> opinion<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.409> water<00:01:46.590> looks<00:01:46.770> fine

00:01:47.029 --> 00:01:47.039 
but um my opinion the water looks fine

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:50.810 
but um my opinion the water looks fine
though<00:01:48.649> so<00:01:49.649> if<00:01:49.859> we<00:01:49.890> keep<00:01:50.280> on<00:01:50.399> moving<00:01:50.670> down

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
though so if we keep on moving down

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.160 
though so if we keep on moving down
these<00:01:51.030> are<00:01:51.210> the<00:01:51.329> Wolves<00:01:51.719> they<00:01:51.840> have<00:01:51.990> like<00:01:52.140> a

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
these are the Wolves they have like a

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.889 
these are the Wolves they have like a
little<00:01:52.350> like<00:01:52.710> checkered<00:01:53.280> a<00:01:53.520> theme<00:01:54.509> which<00:01:54.780> i

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
little like checkered a theme which i

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.929 
little like checkered a theme which i
think<00:01:54.960> is<00:01:55.140> pretty<00:01:55.289> nice<00:01:55.499> we<00:01:56.429> have<00:01:56.520> our<00:01:56.640> dirts

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
think is pretty nice we have our dirts

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.719 
think is pretty nice we have our dirts
or<00:01:57.149> cobblestones<00:01:57.719> I<00:01:58.289> think<00:01:59.039> this<00:01:59.100> is<00:01:59.249> a<00:01:59.280> clean

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
or cobblestones I think this is a clean

00:04:07.169 --> 00:04:08.780 
new addition to the texture pack map I
guess<00:04:07.379> now<00:04:07.889> i<00:04:07.949> have<00:04:08.099> a<00:04:08.129> painting<00:04:08.519> wall<00:04:08.669> and

that's really cool this right here these
are<00:04:12.810> two<00:04:13.049> separate<00:04:13.440> paintings<00:04:13.859> and<00:04:14.129> it<00:04:14.909> looks

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
are two separate paintings and it looks

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:16.729 
are two separate paintings and it looks
like<00:04:15.120> a<00:04:15.209> trap<00:04:15.449> door<00:04:15.629> but<00:04:16.260> it's<00:04:16.380> actually<00:04:16.529> a

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:16.739 
like a trap door but it's actually a

00:04:16.739 --> 00:04:17.959 
like a trap door but it's actually a
painting<00:04:17.070> i<00:04:17.159> think<00:04:17.310> that's<00:04:17.459> really<00:04:17.639> really

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:17.969 
painting i think that's really really

00:04:17.969 --> 00:04:20.210 
painting i think that's really really
cool<00:04:18.060> you<00:04:18.779> have<00:04:18.959> like<00:04:19.169> the<00:04:19.320> dinner

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220 
cool you have like the dinner

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:23.310 
cool you have like the dinner
like<00:04:21.220> a<00:04:21.250> kitchen<00:04:21.700> things<00:04:22.030> you<00:04:22.600> have<00:04:22.750> curtains

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:23.320 
like a kitchen things you have curtains

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.470 
like a kitchen things you have curtains
and<00:04:23.680> these<00:04:23.920> are<00:04:24.010> all<00:04:24.100> paintings<00:04:24.580> so<00:04:24.880> I<00:04:25.120> just

00:04:25.470 --> 00:04:25.480 
and these are all paintings so I just

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:27.990 
and these are all paintings so I just
think<00:04:25.630> they're<00:04:25.780> really<00:04:26.140> really<00:04:26.350> cool<00:04:27.000> and

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.000 
think they're really really cool and

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.850 
think they're really really cool and
that's<00:04:28.480> like<00:04:28.600> the<00:04:28.720> only<00:04:28.750> real<00:04:29.170> painting

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:29.860 
that's like the only real painting

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:31.530 
that's like the only real painting
that's<00:04:30.160> a<00:04:30.310> four<00:04:30.520> by<00:04:30.640> four<00:04:30.670> or<00:04:31.120> two<00:04:31.210> by<00:04:31.480> two

00:04:31.530 --> 00:04:31.540 
that's a four by four or two by two

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:33.480 
that's a four by four or two by two
rather<00:04:31.960> here<00:04:32.650> I<00:04:32.680> think<00:04:33.100> that's<00:04:33.220> just<00:04:33.370> really

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:33.490 
rather here I think that's just really

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:37.740 
rather here I think that's just really
cool<00:04:33.900> so<00:04:34.900> I<00:04:35.080> really<00:04:35.530> like<00:04:35.710> that<00:04:35.740> idea<00:04:36.630> if<00:04:37.630> we

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:37.750 
cool so I really like that idea if we

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:40.230 
cool so I really like that idea if we
take<00:04:37.900> a<00:04:37.960> look<00:04:38.200> at<00:04:38.380> the<00:04:38.680> animals<00:04:39.010> they<00:04:40.000> look

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.240 
take a look at the animals they look

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:43.830 
take a look at the animals they look
pretty<00:04:40.540> standard<00:04:41.110> nothing<00:04:41.860> fantastic<00:04:42.840> about

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:43.840 
pretty standard nothing fantastic about

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:47.760 
pretty standard nothing fantastic about
them<00:04:44.190> and<00:04:45.190> looks<00:04:46.090> the<00:04:46.240> same<00:04:46.450> and<00:04:46.810> your<00:04:47.650> eyes

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:47.770 
them and looks the same and your eyes

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:50.160 
them and looks the same and your eyes
look<00:04:47.800> cool<00:04:48.310> though<00:04:48.510> the<00:04:49.510> glowstone<00:04:49.870> looks

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:50.170 
look cool though the glowstone looks

00:04:50.170 --> 00:04:52.110 
look cool though the glowstone looks
like<00:04:50.410> a<00:04:50.440> block<00:04:50.800> and<00:04:51.040> it<00:04:51.520> looks<00:04:51.670> like<00:04:51.760> a<00:04:51.790> block

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:52.120 
like a block and it looks like a block

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:55.040 
like a block and it looks like a block
of<00:04:52.150> glowing<00:04:53.160> lantern<00:04:54.160> which<00:04:54.520> I<00:04:54.640> guess<00:04:54.820> is<00:04:54.850> a

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.050 
of glowing lantern which I guess is a

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:58.140 
of glowing lantern which I guess is a
different<00:04:56.050> feel<00:04:56.290> than<00:04:56.320> most<00:04:56.860> people<00:04:57.250> have<00:04:57.280> but

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:58.150 
different feel than most people have but

00:04:58.150 --> 00:04:59.490 
different feel than most people have but
you<00:04:58.210> know<00:04:58.300> what<00:04:58.330> I<00:04:58.510> like<00:04:58.750> it<00:04:58.900> at<00:04:59.200> least<00:04:59.320> it's

00:04:59.490 --> 00:04:59.500 
you know what I like it at least it's

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:00.930 
you know what I like it at least it's
not<00:04:59.530> a<00:04:59.650> popcorn<00:04:59.890> style<00:05:00.370> which<00:05:00.580> she<00:05:00.730> dies

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:00.940 
not a popcorn style which she dies

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:05.400 
not a popcorn style which she dies
hopefully<00:05:01.780> no<00:05:01.960> I<00:05:01.990> do<00:05:02.200> not<00:05:02.350> like<00:05:03.150> um<00:05:04.150> and<00:05:04.420> if<00:05:05.290> we

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:05.410 
hopefully no I do not like um and if we

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:07.260 
hopefully no I do not like um and if we
go<00:05:05.530> into<00:05:05.680> the<00:05:05.860> nether<00:05:06.070> you'll<00:05:06.760> see<00:05:06.910> that<00:05:07.060> this
