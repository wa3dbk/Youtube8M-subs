really good that code you know
client-server<00:04:14.680> architecture<00:04:14.769> is<00:04:15.340> really

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:15.639 
client-server architecture is really

00:04:15.639 --> 00:04:19.020 
client-server architecture is really
responsive<00:04:16.479> for<00:04:16.570> the<00:04:16.690> CRISPR<00:04:17.049> with<00:04:17.199> us<00:04:17.940> and<00:04:18.940> we

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:19.030 
responsive for the CRISPR with us and we

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:21.180 
responsive for the CRISPR with us and we
really<00:04:19.150> nailed<00:04:19.690> down<00:04:19.930> the<00:04:20.079> feel<00:04:20.289> of<00:04:20.470> Java<00:04:21.009> on

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:21.190

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:36.130 
bar even higher and I have to say that

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:37.909 
bar even higher and I have to say that
is<00:04:36.310> an<00:04:36.520> amazing<00:04:37.090> way<00:04:37.210> to<00:04:37.240> think<00:04:37.450> about<00:04:37.540> it

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:37.919 
is an amazing way to think about it

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:41.730 
is an amazing way to think about it
especially<00:04:38.919> for<00:04:39.700> me<00:04:39.820> as<00:04:40.000> a<00:04:40.380> consumer<00:04:41.380> and<00:04:41.650> a

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:41.740 
especially for me as a consumer and a

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:43.409 
especially for me as a consumer and a
player<00:04:42.040> of<00:04:42.160> these<00:04:42.280> games<00:04:42.580> because<00:04:42.910> this<00:04:43.090> means

00:04:43.409 --> 00:04:43.419 
player of these games because this means

00:04:43.419 --> 00:04:45.690 
player of these games because this means
that<00:04:43.660> Han<00:04:44.260> he's<00:04:45.010> not<00:04:45.160> going<00:04:45.280> to<00:04:45.310> sit<00:04:45.460> back<00:04:45.639> and

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:45.700 
that Han he's not going to sit back and

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:49.170 
that Han he's not going to sit back and
watch<00:04:46.120> wait<00:04:46.860> they're<00:04:47.860> gonna<00:04:47.950> treat<00:04:48.340> this<00:04:48.520> as<00:04:48.730> a

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:49.180 
watch wait they're gonna treat this as a

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:51.210 
watch wait they're gonna treat this as a

happened<00:06:36.930> -<00:06:37.290> by<00:06:37.410> the<00:06:37.470> time<00:06:37.560> I<00:06:37.710> close<00:06:38.010> the<00:06:38.130> shop

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:38.310 
happened - by the time I close the shop

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:39.440 
happened - by the time I close the shop
window<00:06:38.610> and<00:06:38.640> try<00:06:38.790> to<00:06:38.850> run<00:06:39.000> out<00:06:39.150> of<00:06:39.180> there<00:06:39.360> I'm

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:39.450

00:06:39.450 --> 00:06:42.430 
window and try to run out of there I'm
already<00:06:39.660> dead<00:06:39.960> so<00:06:40.710> I<00:06:40.770> guess<00:06:40.950> that's<00:06:41.070> cool

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:42.440 
already dead so I guess that's cool

pathfinding<00:06:43.440> hasn't<00:06:43.830> improved<00:06:44.130> however<00:06:44.490> we

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:44.790 
pathfinding hasn't improved however we

00:06:44.790 --> 00:06:46.340 
pathfinding hasn't improved however we
don't<00:06:44.940> know<00:06:45.060> much<00:06:45.450> about<00:06:45.510> that<00:06:45.690> so<00:06:46.200> we've

00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:46.350 
don't know much about that so we've

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:48.770 
don't know much about that so we've
actually<00:06:46.470> seen<00:06:46.890> some<00:06:46.950> gameplay<00:06:47.700> they<00:06:48.570> say

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:48.780 
actually seen some gameplay they say

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:51.890 
actually seen some gameplay they say
there's<00:06:49.140> some<00:06:49.260> cool<00:06:49.500> UI<00:06:49.890> stuff<00:06:50.580> there's<00:06:51.510> gonna

00:06:51.890 --> 00:06:51.900 
there's some cool UI stuff there's gonna

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:54.500 
there's some cool UI stuff there's gonna
be<00:06:52.050> lore<00:06:52.440> and<00:06:52.710> hero<00:06:53.130> interactions<00:06:54.030> so<00:06:54.240> I<00:06:54.270> guess

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:54.510 
be lore and hero interactions so I guess

00:06:54.510 --> 00:06:56.360 
be lore and hero interactions so I guess
when<00:06:54.690> two<00:06:54.870> heroes<00:06:55.440> walked<00:06:55.710> by<00:06:55.920> each<00:06:56.160> other

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:56.370 
when two heroes walked by each other

00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:58.220 
when two heroes walked by each other
they're<00:06:57.090> gonna<00:06:57.150> interact<00:06:57.450> in<00:06:57.810> some<00:06:57.990> sort<00:06:58.170> of

00:06:58.220 --> 00:06:58.230 
they're gonna interact in some sort of

00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:00.980 
they're gonna interact in some sort of
unique<00:06:59.130> way<00:06:59.520> that's<00:06:59.820> at<00:07:00.180> least<00:07:00.210> what<00:07:00.900> I've

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:00.990 
unique way that's at least what I've

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:02.150 
unique way that's at least what I've
