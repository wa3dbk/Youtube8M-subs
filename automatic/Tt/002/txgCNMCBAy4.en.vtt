00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
studio it's not a timber studio so you

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.360

never<00:00:37.860> have<00:00:38.160> to<00:00:38.309> paint<00:00:38.579> or<00:00:38.879> stain<00:00:39.000> it<00:00:39.540> and

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
least 25 years and it'll stay looking

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.679 
least 25 years and it'll stay looking
like<00:01:23.880> this<00:01:24.590> in<00:01:25.590> 10<00:01:25.950> years<00:01:26.189> time<00:01:26.460> 15<00:01:27.090> years<00:01:27.360> time

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
like this in 10 years time 15 years time

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.039 
like this in 10 years time 15 years time
it<00:01:28.110> won't<00:01:28.939> deteriorate<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:30.479> way<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.900> way

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
it won't deteriorate the way the way

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.920 
it won't deteriorate the way the way
that<00:01:31.079> a<00:01:31.259> timber<00:01:31.619> studio<00:01:31.979> would<00:01:32.189> and<00:01:32.780> same<00:01:33.780> with

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
that a timber studio would and same with

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:37.179 
that a timber studio would and same with
the<00:01:33.990> windows<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:34.590> windows<00:01:34.619> are<00:01:35.040> you<00:01:35.159> PVC<00:01:35.729> and

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:37.189 
the windows the windows are you PVC and

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:41.140 
the windows the windows are you PVC and
completely<00:01:38.189> zero<00:01:38.790> maintenance<00:01:39.509> so<00:01:40.079> that's

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:41.150 
completely zero maintenance so that's

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:44.960 
completely zero maintenance so that's
the<00:01:42.150> whole<00:01:42.299> studio<00:01:42.659> is<00:01:42.840> like<00:01:42.960> that<00:01:43.820> around<00:01:44.820> the

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
the whole studio is like that around the

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.130 
the whole studio is like that around the
rear<00:01:45.180> as<00:01:45.450> well<00:01:46.340> so<00:01:47.340> as<00:01:47.640> I<00:01:47.670> say<00:01:48.030> they<00:01:48.930> are<00:01:48.960> the

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
rear as well so as I say they are the

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:51.170 
rear as well so as I say they are the
big<00:01:49.320> plus<00:01:49.590> because<00:01:50.159> it's<00:01:50.340> zero<00:01:50.579> maintenance

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
big plus because it's zero maintenance

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.950 
big plus because it's zero maintenance
you<00:01:51.450> can<00:01:52.250> install<00:01:53.250> this<00:01:53.490> studio<00:01:53.970> very<00:01:54.570> close

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
you can install this studio very close

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.200 
you can install this studio very close
to<00:01:55.290> a<00:01:55.320> boundary<00:01:56.070> or<00:01:56.159> a<00:01:56.310> fence<00:01:56.549> because<00:01:56.939> you

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
to a boundary or a fence because you

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.530 
to a boundary or a fence because you
don't<00:01:57.420> need<00:01:57.600> access<00:01:57.930> to<00:01:58.530> get<00:01:59.460> at<00:01:59.610> it<00:01:59.790> to<00:02:00.090> paint

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
don't need access to get at it to paint

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:03.469 
don't need access to get at it to paint
and<00:02:00.719> stain<00:02:00.990> it<00:02:01.579> we<00:02:02.579> used<00:02:02.759> to<00:02:02.880> do<00:02:03.030> timber

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
and stain it we used to do timber

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.679 
and stain it we used to do timber
studios<00:02:04.549> that's<00:02:05.549> what<00:02:05.820> Alex<00:02:06.119> started<00:02:06.570> out

00:02:06.679 --> 00:02:06.689 
studios that's what Alex started out

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:10.190 
studios that's what Alex started out
doing<00:02:07.079> in<00:02:07.229> the<00:02:07.439> year<00:02:07.619> 2000<00:02:08.399> but<00:02:08.750> once<00:02:09.750> we<00:02:09.989> got

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
doing in the year 2000 but once we got

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.350 
doing in the year 2000 but once we got
onto<00:02:10.410> this<00:02:10.679> model<00:02:11.129> we<00:02:11.280> stopped<00:02:11.790> the<00:02:12.000> timber

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
onto this model we stopped the timber

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
onto this model we stopped the timber
ones<00:02:12.569> in

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
ones in

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.870 
ones in
20:12<00:02:14.250> so<00:02:15.410> so<00:02:16.410> yeah<00:02:16.650> so<00:02:17.280> hopefully<00:02:17.670> that's

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
20:12 so so yeah so hopefully that's

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:20.630 
20:12 so so yeah so hopefully that's
helped<00:02:18.780> there's<00:02:19.740> some<00:02:19.890> other<00:02:20.070> aspects<00:02:20.490> of

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:20.640 
helped there's some other aspects of

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:24.770 
helped there's some other aspects of
this<00:02:20.820> which<00:02:21.240> I'll<00:02:21.600> do<00:02:21.990> in<00:02:22.020> another<00:02:22.380> video
