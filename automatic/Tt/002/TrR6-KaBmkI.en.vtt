 good friends you have the last 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.410
 word in choosing I stay with the 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:06.480
 motorola device because I walk 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.970
 looking for a phone resistant to 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:12.690
 rain and because it records video in format 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:14.910
 full hd however if you need 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:17.400
 a faster phone to open 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:20.310
 applications I recommend the alcatel 

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:22.350
 one touch we have reached the end and we 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:26.210
