00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149 
you wherever you go let's do the

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:43.940 
you wherever you go let's do the
unboxing<00:00:42.300> and<00:00:42.719> let's<00:00:42.989> see<00:00:43.290> what<00:00:43.530> is<00:00:43.710> there<00:00:43.920> on

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
unboxing and let's see what is there on

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.709 
unboxing and let's see what is there on
the<00:00:44.129> book<00:00:44.280> first<00:00:44.489> of<00:00:44.610> all<00:00:44.789> before<00:00:45.120> we<00:00:45.450> do<00:00:45.600> the

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
the book first of all before we do the

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:46.160 
the book first of all before we do the
unboxing

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
unboxing

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.700 
unboxing
so<00:00:46.710> it<00:00:46.980> says<00:00:47.190> portable<00:00:47.700> power<00:00:47.850> supply<00:00:48.239> and<00:00:48.710> the

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
so it says portable power supply and the

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.000 
so it says portable power supply and the
rate<00:00:50.520> rating<00:00:51.180> of<00:00:51.300> this<00:00:51.510> power<00:00:51.690> supply<00:00:51.840> is<00:00:52.079> 3500

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
rate rating of this power supply is 3500

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.310 
rate rating of this power supply is 3500
milliampere<00:00:53.520> so<00:00:54.270> normally<00:00:54.719> phones<00:00:54.989> have

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
milliampere so normally phones have

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.220 
milliampere so normally phones have
battery<00:00:55.949> of<00:00:56.100> around<00:00:56.340> 1,500<00:00:57.090> to<00:00:57.300> 2,000

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
battery of around 1,500 to 2,000

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.410 
battery of around 1,500 to 2,000
milliampere<00:00:58.739> so<00:00:59.100> this<00:00:59.730> battery<00:01:00.059> pack<00:01:00.120> should

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
milliampere so this battery pack should

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.229 
milliampere so this battery pack should
be<00:01:00.570> sufficient<00:01:01.079> to<00:01:01.140> charge<00:01:01.500> your<00:01:01.739> phone

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:02.239 
be sufficient to charge your phone

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:05.090 
be sufficient to charge your phone
approximately<00:01:03.239> 1.5<00:01:03.870> times<00:01:04.290> on<00:01:04.619> the<00:01:04.739> go<00:01:04.920> and

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
approximately 1.5 times on the go and

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.300 
approximately 1.5 times on the go and
then<00:01:06.060> it<00:01:06.330> has<00:01:06.570> a<00:01:06.600> fast<00:01:07.020> output<00:01:07.619> current<00:01:08.070> which

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
then it has a fast output current which

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.810 
then it has a fast output current which
is<00:01:08.460> 1<00:01:08.640> point<00:01:08.880> 5<00:01:09.090> ampere<00:01:09.930> current<00:01:10.110> and<00:01:10.439> it<00:01:11.400> comes

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
is 1 point 5 ampere current and it comes

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.420 
is 1 point 5 ampere current and it comes
with<00:01:12.030> a<00:01:12.060> charger<00:01:12.360> a<00:01:12.750> universal<00:01:13.740> wall<00:01:14.010> charger

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
with a charger a universal wall charger

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.219 
with a charger a universal wall charger
