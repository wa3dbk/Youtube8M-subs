00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:11.370 
I don't think crowdsourcing eradicate
the<00:02:10.000> business<00:02:10.330> it<00:02:10.479> just<00:02:10.509> changes<00:02:11.230> it

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
the business it just changes it

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:13.830 
the business it just changes it
dramatically<00:02:12.010> it<00:02:12.430> forces<00:02:12.850> companies<00:02:13.090> to

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
dramatically it forces companies to

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.440 
dramatically it forces companies to
approach<00:02:14.620> us<00:02:14.860> as<00:02:15.070> potential<00:02:15.640> partners<00:02:16.150> and

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
approach us as potential partners and

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.360 
approach us as potential partners and
that's<00:02:17.050> much<00:02:17.350> more<00:02:17.380> interesting<00:02:17.560> and<00:02:18.280> much

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.370 
that's much more interesting and much

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.060 
that's much more interesting and much
more<00:02:18.790> exciting<00:02:19.390> we<00:02:19.870> do<00:02:20.050> buy<00:02:20.230> things<00:02:20.650> but<00:02:20.980> we

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:21.070 
more exciting we do buy things but we

00:02:21.070 --> 00:02:23.970 
more exciting we do buy things but we
also<00:02:21.270> participate<00:02:22.270> meaningfully<00:02:22.540> in<00:02:23.260> the

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
also participate meaningfully in the

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.520 
also participate meaningfully in the
process<00:02:24.670> by<00:02:25.240> which<00:02:25.270> those<00:02:25.930> products<00:02:26.410> are

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:26.530 
process by which those products are

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:28.140 
process by which those products are
created<00:02:26.680> what<00:02:27.610> we<00:02:27.730> see<00:02:27.880> with<00:02:28.060> these

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
created what we see with these

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:29.699 
created what we see with these
successful<00:02:28.600> forms<00:02:28.959> of<00:02:29.050> crowdsourcing<00:02:29.230> is

00:02:29.699 --> 00:02:29.709 
successful forms of crowdsourcing is

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:32.699 
successful forms of crowdsourcing is
that<00:02:30.310> they<00:02:30.700> came<00:02:30.910> up<00:02:31.090> organically<00:02:31.420> from<00:02:32.230> the

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
that they came up organically from the

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:34.650 
that they came up organically from the
people<00:02:33.070> formerly<00:02:33.550> known<00:02:33.790> as<00:02:33.820> customers<00:02:34.510> from

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:34.660 
people formerly known as customers from

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.240 
people formerly known as customers from
the<00:02:34.720> people<00:02:35.080> formerly<00:02:35.560> known<00:02:35.920> as<00:02:35.950> the

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
the people formerly known as the

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:39.720 
the people formerly known as the
audience<00:02:36.780> the<00:02:37.780> technology<00:02:38.560> is<00:02:38.709> so<00:02:38.950> good<00:02:39.340> that

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:39.730 
audience the technology is so good that

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.600 
audience the technology is so good that
it's<00:02:40.300> become<00:02:40.750> easier<00:02:41.170> for<00:02:41.739> people<00:02:41.980> to<00:02:42.250> become

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
it's become easier for people to become

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.630 
it's become easier for people to become
very<00:02:43.120> good<00:02:43.420> and<00:02:43.660> then<00:02:44.140> finally<00:02:44.739> the<00:02:45.130> emergence

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:45.640 
very good and then finally the emergence

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:47.670 
very good and then finally the emergence
of<00:02:45.730> online<00:02:46.270> communities<00:02:46.870> I<00:02:47.080> like<00:02:47.350> to<00:02:47.470> think

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
of online communities I like to think

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.800 
of online communities I like to think
about<00:02:47.860> the<00:02:47.980> online<00:02:48.400> community<00:02:48.970> as<00:02:49.150> kind<00:02:49.750> of

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
about the online community as kind of

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.410 
about the online community as kind of
the<00:02:49.900> building<00:02:50.380> block<00:02:50.680> of<00:02:51.010> crowdsourcing<00:02:51.420> it's

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 
the building block of crowdsourcing it's

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.150 
the building block of crowdsourcing it's
what<00:02:52.570> the<00:02:52.660> corporation<00:02:53.410> is<00:02:53.650> to<00:02:54.040> the

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.160 
what the corporation is to the

00:02:54.160 --> 00:02:56.070 
what the corporation is to the
industrial<00:02:54.820> era<00:02:55.060> it<00:02:55.540> showed<00:02:55.870> that<00:02:55.900> people

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.080 
industrial era it showed that people

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:59.100 
industrial era it showed that people
could<00:02:56.650> come<00:02:56.860> together<00:02:57.130> and<00:02:57.550> self<00:02:58.390> organize

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
could come together and self organize

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.120 
could come together and self organize
into<00:02:59.830> productive<00:03:00.430> units<00:03:00.910> what<00:03:01.330> once<00:03:01.660> took

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
into productive units what once took

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:04.830 
into productive units what once took
managers<00:03:03.130> and<00:03:03.400> a<00:03:03.459> corporate<00:03:03.850> hierarchy<00:03:04.090> can

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:04.840 
managers and a corporate hierarchy can

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:06.660 
managers and a corporate hierarchy can
now<00:03:05.049> be<00:03:05.230> done<00:03:05.440> in<00:03:05.680> the<00:03:05.980> context<00:03:06.459> of<00:03:06.519> the

now be done in the context of the
