out should go on youtube and I've been
whirling<00:01:16.320> dervish<00:01:17.070> and<00:01:17.450> so<00:01:18.450> that's<00:01:18.600> where

whirling dervish and so that's where

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.070 
whirling dervish and so that's where
they<00:01:18.930> got<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:19.259> name<00:01:19.290> for<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:19.799> board<00:01:20.040> a<00:01:20.960> lot<00:01:21.960> of

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
they got the name for the board a lot of

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.899 
they got the name for the board a lot of
their<00:01:22.200> boards<00:01:22.530> are<00:01:22.710> named<00:01:22.920> after<00:01:23.130> dances<00:01:23.700> like

00:01:23.899 --> 00:01:23.909 
their boards are named after dances like

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:29.179 
their boards are named after dances like
the<00:01:23.970> bhangra<00:01:24.650> which<00:01:25.650> is<00:01:25.770> in<00:01:25.860> any<00:01:26.040> advance<00:01:28.189> so

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:29.189 
the bhangra which is in any advance so

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.609 
the bhangra which is in any advance so
yes<00:01:29.909> that's<00:01:30.509> I<00:01:30.810> think<00:01:30.900> that's<00:01:31.259> also<00:01:31.530> the

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
yes that's I think that's also the

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:34.819 
yes that's I think that's also the
inspiration<00:01:31.740> for<00:01:32.729> the<00:01:33.140> big<00:01:34.140> graphic<00:01:34.320> here<00:01:34.650> I

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
inspiration for the big graphic here I

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.390 
inspiration for the big graphic here I
think<00:01:35.640> this<00:01:35.729> is<00:01:35.790> the<00:01:36.590> like<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.740> rope<00:01:37.979> from<00:01:38.220> the

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
think this is the like the rope from the

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:45.800 
think this is the like the rope from the
dervish<00:01:40.520> so<00:01:41.520> that's<00:01:41.700> pretty<00:01:41.909> cool<00:01:44.420> the<00:01:45.420> specs

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
dervish so that's pretty cool the specs

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:51.109 
dervish so that's pretty cool the specs
on<00:01:46.079> this<00:01:46.350> board<00:01:47.119> are<00:01:49.430> 41<00:01:50.430> and<00:01:50.549> a<00:01:50.579> half<00:01:50.700> inches

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
on this board are 41 and a half inches

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:56.300 
on this board are 41 and a half inches
long<00:01:51.500> 8<00:01:52.500> mathenge<00:01:53.040> is<00:01:53.189> wide<00:01:53.549> and<00:01:54.350> a<00:01:55.350> 33<00:01:56.040> inch

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
long 8 mathenge is wide and a 33 inch

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:02.920 
long 8 mathenge is wide and a 33 inch
wheelbase

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:02.930 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:09.130

for that they're on our Channel and this
current<00:02:16.950> setup<00:02:17.310> is<00:02:19.490> Paris<00:02:20.490> 180<00:02:20.760> trucks<00:02:21.150> and

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190 
current setup is Paris 180 trucks and

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:29.000 
current setup is Paris 180 trucks and
yellow<00:02:23.190> stimulus<00:02:23.700> is<00:02:26.000> I'll<00:02:27.000> do<00:02:27.300> review<00:02:27.750> on<00:02:28.140> the

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
yellow stimulus is I'll do review on the

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.890 
yellow stimulus is I'll do review on the
stimulus<00:02:29.400> is<00:02:29.550> later<00:02:29.760> probably<00:02:30.450> not<00:02:30.540> the<00:02:30.660> Paris

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:30.900 
stimulus is later probably not the Paris

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.300 
stimulus is later probably not the Paris
when<00:02:31.050> a<00:02:31.080> tease<00:02:31.320> because<00:02:31.470> if<00:02:31.680> no<00:02:31.830> one<00:02:32.040> has<00:02:32.250> those

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
when a tease because if no one has those

when a tease because if no one has those
so<00:02:35.310> yeah<00:02:41.480> that's<00:02:42.480> my<00:02:42.690> setup<00:02:43.200> in<00:02:43.410> case<00:02:43.710> that

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
so yeah that's my setup in case that

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:47.240 
so yeah that's my setup in case that
that<00:02:45.050> that<00:02:46.050> helps<00:02:46.200> you<00:02:46.470> decide<00:02:46.800> anything<00:02:47.100> I

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:56.180 
don't know so right away when you buy
the<00:02:51.540> board<00:02:51.930> it<00:02:52.620> comes<00:02:53.100> with<00:02:54.170> this<00:02:55.170> spray<00:02:56.010> on

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190

really<00:03:02.310> I<00:03:02.340> found<00:03:03.090> that<00:03:03.270> it<00:03:03.390> didn't<00:03:03.630> work<00:03:03.780> very

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
really I found that it didn't work very

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:06.470 
really I found that it didn't work very
well<00:03:04.170> it<00:03:04.620> came<00:03:04.980> off<00:03:05.250> or<00:03:05.700> a<00:03:05.730> war<00:03:06.000> out<00:03:06.030> really

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
well it came off or a war out really

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.210 
well it came off or a war out really
quickly<00:03:06.720> and<00:03:07.110> it<00:03:07.230> just<00:03:07.410> didn't<00:03:07.650> grip<00:03:07.920> very

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
quickly and it just didn't grip very

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.990 
quickly and it just didn't grip very
well<00:03:08.400> in<00:03:08.610> person<00:03:08.880> to<00:03:09.360> grip<00:03:10.110> tape<00:03:10.320> so<00:03:10.980> if<00:03:11.580> you

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
well in person to grip tape so if you

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.670 
well in person to grip tape so if you
check<00:03:12.270> on<00:03:12.390> our<00:03:12.420> channel<00:03:12.870> or<00:03:13.020> the<00:03:13.050> annotation

check on our channel or the annotation

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.940 
check on our channel or the annotation
that<00:03:13.830> i<00:03:13.860> put<00:03:14.100> here<00:03:14.430> order<00:03:14.850> that<00:03:15.030> are<00:03:15.239> there<00:03:15.950> you

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:16.950 
that i put here order that are there you

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.670 
that i put here order that are there you
can<00:03:17.130> see<00:03:17.160> ADA<00:03:18.030> torial<00:03:18.360> on<00:03:18.420> how<00:03:18.600> to<00:03:18.660> take<00:03:19.380> that

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
can see ADA torial on how to take that

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.800 
can see ADA torial on how to take that
the<00:03:20.310> original<00:03:20.760> grip<00:03:21.090> off<00:03:21.300> and<00:03:21.510> put<00:03:21.660> on<00:03:21.780> your

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
the original grip off and put on your

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:24.470 
the original grip off and put on your
own<00:03:22.050> cupcake<00:03:22.440> so<00:03:22.920> that's<00:03:23.820> pretty<00:03:24.239> helpful

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
own cupcake so that's pretty helpful

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:27.080 
own cupcake so that's pretty helpful
because<00:03:24.959> these<00:03:25.410> the<00:03:26.040> grip<00:03:26.310> that<00:03:26.700> comes<00:03:26.970> on

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
because these the grip that comes on

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:33.590 
because these the grip that comes on
here<00:03:27.270> not<00:03:27.480> pretty<00:03:27.690> good<00:03:27.870> I<00:03:32.150> made<00:03:33.150> this<00:03:33.300> pretty

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600 
here not pretty good I made this pretty

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.979 
here not pretty good I made this pretty
cool<00:03:33.989> design<00:03:35.480> but<00:03:36.480> it<00:03:36.570> took<00:03:36.660> a<00:03:36.720> really<00:03:36.870> long

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
cool design but it took a really long

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:40.010 
cool design but it took a really long
time<00:03:37.110> so<00:03:38.120> yeah<00:03:39.120> I<00:03:39.150> don't<00:03:39.570> know<00:03:39.630> if<00:03:39.690> it's<00:03:39.840> worth

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:40.020 
time so yeah I don't know if it's worth

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:46.460 
time so yeah I don't know if it's worth
it<00:03:40.140> or<00:03:40.260> not

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:46.470 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:51.620 

so<00:03:47.470> I<00:03:48.090> would<00:03:49.090> say<00:03:49.360> overall<00:03:50.080> it's<00:03:50.530> a<00:03:50.680> nice<00:03:50.890> ride

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
so I would say overall it's a nice ride

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:53.790 
so I would say overall it's a nice ride
except<00:03:52.630> if<00:03:52.870> you're<00:03:53.140> if<00:03:53.500> you're<00:03:53.620> going

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:53.800 
except if you're if you're going

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.250 
except if you're if you're going
downhill<00:03:54.100> or<00:03:54.520> if<00:03:54.580> you're<00:03:54.670> doing<00:03:54.850> sliding<00:03:55.360> a

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:56.260 
downhill or if you're doing sliding a

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.820 
downhill or if you're doing sliding a
lot<00:03:56.590> of<00:03:56.680> people<00:03:56.920> do<00:03:57.730> slides<00:03:58.030> I'm<00:03:58.210> here<00:03:58.420> I

00:03:58.820 --> 00:03:58.830 
lot of people do slides I'm here I

00:03:58.830 --> 00:04:01.430 
lot of people do slides I'm here I
personally<00:03:59.830> do<00:03:59.890> not<00:03:59.950> feel<00:04:00.160> comfortable<00:04:00.190> on<00:04:00.790> it

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
personally do not feel comfortable on it

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.260 
personally do not feel comfortable on it
in<00:04:02.440> comparison<00:04:03.040> to<00:04:03.130> my<00:04:03.220> Alison<00:04:03.550> spindrift<00:04:03.910> the

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:04.270 
in comparison to my Alison spindrift the

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:08.060 
in comparison to my Alison spindrift the
spin<00:04:04.600> roof<00:04:04.750> just<00:04:04.930> feels<00:04:05.200> much<00:04:05.470> sturdier<00:04:06.130> and<00:04:07.050> I

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:08.070 
spin roof just feels much sturdier and I

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:10.470 
spin roof just feels much sturdier and I
just<00:04:09.070> feel<00:04:09.280> like<00:04:09.400> I'm<00:04:09.670> able<00:04:09.880> to<00:04:10.000> control<00:04:10.420> that

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:10.480 
just feel like I'm able to control that

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.750 
just feel like I'm able to control that
board<00:04:10.870> a<00:04:10.930> lot<00:04:11.110> more<00:04:11.350> than<00:04:11.410> this<00:04:11.760> the

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:12.760 
board a lot more than this the

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.870 
board a lot more than this the
flexibility<00:04:13.450> on<00:04:13.600> here<00:04:14.190> kind<00:04:15.190> of<00:04:15.310> kills<00:04:15.640> it

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:15.880 
flexibility on here kind of kills it

00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:19.410 
flexibility on here kind of kills it
honestly<00:04:16.450> it's<00:04:17.020> I<00:04:17.920> find<00:04:18.880> it<00:04:18.940> a<00:04:19.000> little<00:04:19.090> too

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:19.420 
honestly it's I find it a little too

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:22.830 
honestly it's I find it a little too
flexible<00:04:19.980> because<00:04:21.150> when<00:04:22.150> i'm<00:04:22.270> doing<00:04:22.450> things

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:22.840 
flexible because when i'm doing things

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.890 
flexible because when i'm doing things
like<00:04:23.020> shove<00:04:23.410> its<00:04:24.180> yet<00:04:25.180> these<00:04:25.300> king<00:04:25.540> tails<00:04:25.750> are

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:25.900 
like shove its yet these king tails are

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:28.020 
like shove its yet these king tails are
great<00:04:26.050> for<00:04:26.200> shove<00:04:26.410> its<00:04:26.590> and<00:04:26.830> angles<00:04:27.760> and<00:04:27.970> stuff

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.030 
great for shove its and angles and stuff

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:30.120 
great for shove its and angles and stuff
like<00:04:28.240> that<00:04:28.300> but<00:04:28.720> the<00:04:29.290> flats<00:04:29.620> kind<00:04:29.980> of

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:30.130 
like that but the flats kind of

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:32.010 
like that but the flats kind of
restrains<00:04:30.790> you<00:04:30.970> in<00:04:31.150> that<00:04:31.240> respect<00:04:31.600> because<00:04:31.690> if

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:32.020 
restrains you in that respect because if

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.650 
restrains you in that respect because if
you<00:04:32.580> if<00:04:33.580> you<00:04:33.730> land<00:04:33.970> the<00:04:34.060> wrong<00:04:34.180> way<00:04:34.360> with<00:04:34.570> the

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:34.660 
you if you land the wrong way with the

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:37.470 
you if you land the wrong way with the
wrong<00:04:34.780> weight<00:04:35.020> distribution<00:04:35.680> it'll<00:04:36.610> like

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:37.480 
wrong weight distribution it'll like

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:39.240 
wrong weight distribution it'll like
push<00:04:37.780> the<00:04:37.960> board<00:04:38.200> really<00:04:38.740> it'll<00:04:38.920> really

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:39.250 
push the board really it'll really

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:40.320 
push the board really it'll really
easily<00:04:39.520> push<00:04:39.730> the<00:04:39.850> board<00:04:40.030> out<00:04:40.150> from

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.330 
easily push the board out from

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:42.240 
easily push the board out from
underneath<00:04:40.570> you<00:04:40.750> because<00:04:41.260> the<00:04:42.070> board

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:42.250 
underneath you because the board

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:44.460 
underneath you because the board
compresses<00:04:42.880> and<00:04:42.910> then<00:04:43.360> you<00:04:43.540> like<00:04:43.810> push<00:04:44.110> it<00:04:44.320> out

00:04:44.460 --> 00:04:44.470 
compresses and then you like push it out

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:47.880 
compresses and then you like push it out
with<00:04:44.770> all<00:04:44.920> your<00:04:45.070> energy<00:04:45.150> so<00:04:46.320> if<00:04:47.320> you<00:04:47.470> check<00:04:47.710> out

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:47.890 
with all your energy so if you check out

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:51.090 
with all your energy so if you check out
the<00:04:48.100> video<00:04:49.020> called<00:04:50.020> learning<00:04:50.500> shove<00:04:50.860> its<00:04:51.010> or

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:51.100 
the video called learning shove its or

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:52.290 
the video called learning shove its or
something<00:04:51.310> like<00:04:51.400> that<00:04:51.460> on<00:04:51.640> our<00:04:51.790> channel

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:52.300 
something like that on our channel

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.270 
something like that on our channel
you'll<00:04:52.330> see<00:04:52.960> that<00:04:53.140> a<00:04:53.200> couple<00:04:53.710> I<00:04:53.920> had<00:04:54.070> a<00:04:54.100> couple

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:54.280 
you'll see that a couple I had a couple

00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:56.850 
you'll see that a couple I had a couple
of<00:04:54.400> bed<00:04:54.520> folds<00:04:54.910> and<00:04:55.260> the<00:04:56.260> reason<00:04:56.620> is<00:04:56.710> because

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:56.860 
of bed folds and the reason is because

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:58.980 
of bed folds and the reason is because
of<00:04:57.010> the<00:04:57.130> flexibility<00:04:57.610> to<00:04:57.670> this<00:04:57.790> board<00:04:58.090> and<00:04:58.270> i

00:04:58.980 --> 00:04:58.990 
of the flexibility to this board and i

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:01.770 
of the flexibility to this board and i
have<00:04:59.110> flex<00:04:59.320> 2<00:04:59.590> which<00:04:59.830> is<00:04:59.860> the<00:05:00.220> less<00:05:01.030> more

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:01.780 
have flex 2 which is the less more

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:04.020 
have flex 2 which is the less more
flexibly<00:05:02.350> two<00:05:02.680> so<00:05:03.520> that<00:05:03.640> might<00:05:03.820> be<00:05:03.850> the<00:05:03.940> reason

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:04.030 
flexibly two so that might be the reason

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:06.930 
flexibly two so that might be the reason
for<00:05:04.270> it<00:05:04.600> it<00:05:05.590> says<00:05:05.920> it's<00:05:06.100> supposed<00:05:06.160> to<00:05:06.430> be<00:05:06.580> four

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:06.940 
for it it says it's supposed to be four

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:11.900 
for it it says it's supposed to be four
riders<00:05:07.890> 102<00:05:08.890> 170<00:05:09.640> pounds<00:05:10.210> and<00:05:10.450> I'm<00:05:10.690> 130<00:05:11.410> pounds

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:11.910 
riders 102 170 pounds and I'm 130 pounds

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:14.340 
riders 102 170 pounds and I'm 130 pounds
so<00:05:12.910> I<00:05:13.240> would<00:05:13.420> recommend<00:05:13.450> just<00:05:14.020> getting<00:05:14.260> the

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:14.350 
so I would recommend just getting the

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:16.080 
so I would recommend just getting the
flex<00:05:14.620> one<00:05:15.010> if<00:05:15.670> you're<00:05:15.850> thinking<00:05:15.880> about

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:16.090 
flex one if you're thinking about

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:20.100 
flex one if you're thinking about
getting<00:05:16.270> a<00:05:16.420> dervish<00:05:17.430> to<00:05:18.430> prevent<00:05:18.850> that<00:05:19.600> sort

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:20.110 
getting a dervish to prevent that sort

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:26.430 
getting a dervish to prevent that sort
of<00:05:22.530> flex<00:05:23.820> dealing<00:05:24.820> with<00:05:24.940> you<00:05:25.090> however<00:05:26.050> you

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:26.440 
of flex dealing with you however you

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:27.570 
of flex dealing with you however you
know<00:05:26.560> if<00:05:26.650> you're<00:05:26.800> just<00:05:26.890> looking<00:05:27.010> to<00:05:27.280> do<00:05:27.430> some

00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:27.580 
know if you're just looking to do some

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:30.120 
know if you're just looking to do some
dancing<00:05:27.970> and<00:05:28.060> some<00:05:28.240> cruising<00:05:28.780> and<00:05:29.020> carving<00:05:29.920> so

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:30.130 
dancing and some cruising and carving so

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:33.660 
dancing and some cruising and carving so
this<00:05:30.310> is<00:05:30.430> great<00:05:31.920> but<00:05:32.920> when<00:05:33.310> you're<00:05:33.430> trying<00:05:33.580> to

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:33.670 
this is great but when you're trying to

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:36.180 
this is great but when you're trying to
get<00:05:33.820> in<00:05:33.940> like<00:05:34.870> some<00:05:35.260> technical<00:05:35.650> sliding<00:05:36.040> and

00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:36.190 
get in like some technical sliding and

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:39.030 
get in like some technical sliding and
stuff<00:05:36.370> that<00:05:36.400> requires<00:05:37.200> more<00:05:38.200> sturdy<00:05:38.590> board

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:39.040 
stuff that requires more sturdy board

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:42.300 
stuff that requires more sturdy board
then<00:05:39.370> I<00:05:39.850> wouldn't<00:05:40.390> go<00:05:40.570> with<00:05:40.900> the<00:05:41.590> Dervish<00:05:41.980> or

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:42.310 
then I wouldn't go with the Dervish or

00:05:42.310 --> 00:05:48.320 
then I wouldn't go with the Dervish or
flexed<00:05:43.060> especially<00:05:43.750> flex<00:05:43.990> to<00:05:44.260> your<00:05:44.530> wish

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:48.330 

00:05:48.330 --> 00:05:53.839 

I<00:05:48.979> I<00:05:50.449> generally<00:05:51.650> found<00:05:52.650> that<00:05:52.979> I<00:05:53.009> would<00:05:53.430> really

00:05:53.839 --> 00:05:53.849 
I I generally found that I would really

00:05:53.849 --> 00:05:55.790 
I I generally found that I would really
easily<00:05:54.150> get<00:05:54.300> speedball<00:05:54.780> all<00:05:54.840> those<00:05:55.050> speed

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:55.800 
easily get speedball all those speed

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:59.779 
easily get speedball all those speed
wobbles<00:05:56.250> on<00:05:56.370> here<00:05:58.189> which<00:05:59.189> is<00:05:59.340> not<00:05:59.520> a<00:05:59.550> good

00:05:59.779 --> 00:05:59.789 
wobbles on here which is not a good

00:05:59.789 --> 00:06:02.800 
wobbles on here which is not a good
thing<00:06:00.120> so<00:06:00.750> that's<00:06:01.560> another<00:06:01.770> reason<00:06:02.009> not<00:06:02.159> to

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:02.810 
thing so that's another reason not to

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:06.709 
thing so that's another reason not to
consider<00:06:03.810> getting<00:06:04.229> it<00:06:04.500> or<00:06:04.949> down<00:06:05.669> Hitler<00:06:06.120> speed

00:06:06.709 --> 00:06:06.719 
consider getting it or down Hitler speed

00:06:06.719 --> 00:06:10.850 
consider getting it or down Hitler speed
I<00:06:08.689> also<00:06:09.689> another<00:06:10.229> thing<00:06:10.379> i<00:06:10.530> don't<00:06:10.650> really<00:06:10.740> like

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:10.860 
I also another thing i don't really like

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:13.779 
I also another thing i don't really like
about<00:06:11.129> the<00:06:11.370> board<00:06:11.610> is<00:06:11.759> that<00:06:12.000> the<00:06:12.300> aim<00:06:13.229> app<00:06:13.379> inch

00:06:13.779 --> 00:06:13.789

about the board is that the aim app inch
width<00:06:14.789> is<00:06:15.060> kind<00:06:15.389> of<00:06:15.539> small<00:06:15.860> my<00:06:16.860> other<00:06:17.069> the
