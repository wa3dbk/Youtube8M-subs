00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.840 
well and maybe is just me maybe I'm just
thinking<00:00:37.440> it's<00:00:37.649> a<00:00:37.829> little<00:00:38.160> bit<00:00:38.250> better<00:00:38.460> but<00:00:38.790> I

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
thinking it's a little bit better but I

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.850 
thinking it's a little bit better but I
did<00:00:39.120> the<00:00:39.270> hipfire<00:00:39.510> it's<00:00:40.230> a<00:00:40.350> little<00:00:40.620> bit<00:00:40.710> better

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
did the hipfire it's a little bit better

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.920 
did the hipfire it's a little bit better
with<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.430> foregrip<00:00:42.059> I<00:00:42.270> could<00:00:42.510> be<00:00:42.690> wrong<00:00:42.870> about

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
with the foregrip I could be wrong about

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.930 
with the foregrip I could be wrong about
that<00:00:43.200> but<00:00:43.559> it<00:00:43.649> just<00:00:43.829> seems<00:00:44.190> to<00:00:44.309> be<00:00:44.370> better<00:00:44.730> in

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
that but it just seems to be better in

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.360 
that but it just seems to be better in
my<00:00:45.120> opinion<00:00:45.350> overall<00:00:46.350> the<00:00:46.469> doing<00:00:46.770> Tetris<00:00:47.219> for

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
worse for what I'm hearing on pc so I

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.199 
worse for what I'm hearing on pc so I
don't<00:03:05.200> know<00:03:05.470> exactly<00:03:06.400> what<00:03:06.670> everybody<00:03:07.150> else

experiences but as far as my experiences

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:13.229 
experiences but as far as my experiences
it<00:03:10.030> just<00:03:10.930> doesn't<00:03:11.470> seem<00:03:11.950> that<00:03:12.250> much<00:03:12.640> different

00:03:13.229 --> 00:03:13.239

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:16.420 
now will omit this there cuz some

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:18.300 
now will omit this there cuz some
collisions<00:03:16.989> have<00:03:17.200> been<00:03:17.440> fixed<00:03:17.919> but<00:03:18.010> for<00:03:18.220> the

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
way they were trying to fix it maybe I'm

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.780 
way they were trying to fix it maybe I'm
just<00:03:40.720> overlooking<00:03:41.440> those<00:03:41.680> but<00:03:42.220> for<00:03:42.430> the<00:03:42.519> most

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
just overlooking those but for the most

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:45.960 
just overlooking those but for the most
part<00:03:42.970> for<00:03:43.569> my<00:03:43.660> all-night<00:03:44.169> gaming<00:03:44.379> um<00:03:44.889> no<00:03:45.669> like

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970

part for my all-night gaming um no like
all<00:03:46.480> night<00:03:46.750> gave<00:03:46.930> me<00:03:46.959> an<00:03:47.079> experience<00:03:47.470> that<00:03:47.530> I

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
all night gave me an experience that I

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.390 
all night gave me an experience that I
had<00:03:48.010> with<00:03:48.549> the<00:03:48.699> patch<00:03:48.970> I<00:03:49.329> just<00:03:50.109> did<00:03:50.349> not<00:03:50.620> see<00:03:51.160> a

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
had with the patch I just did not see a

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.849 
had with the patch I just did not see a
lot<00:03:51.730> of<00:03:51.760> in-game<00:03:52.419> improvements<00:03:53.319> are<00:03:53.440> really

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:53.859 
lot of in-game improvements are really

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:55.909 
lot of in-game improvements are really
did<00:03:54.010> enough<00:03:54.190> besides<00:03:54.430> the<00:03:54.970> menus<00:03:55.419> guys

00:03:55.909 --> 00:03:55.919 
did enough besides the menus guys

00:03:55.919 --> 00:03:58.409 
did enough besides the menus guys
besides<00:03:56.919> the<00:03:57.250> minions<00:03:57.699> now<00:03:57.819> people<00:03:58.120> have<00:03:58.239> been

00:03:58.409 --> 00:03:58.419 
besides the minions now people have been

00:03:58.419 --> 00:03:59.849 
besides the minions now people have been
claiming<00:03:58.690> that<00:03:58.930> the<00:03:59.139> graphics<00:03:59.650> are<00:03:59.829> better

00:03:59.849 --> 00:03:59.859 
claiming that the graphics are better

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:03.210 
claiming that the graphics are better
and<00:04:00.449> I<00:04:01.449> think<00:04:01.840> that's<00:04:02.109> more<00:04:02.410> to<00:04:02.650> do<00:04:02.859> with<00:04:03.040> the

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:03.220 
and I think that's more to do with the

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:06.000 
and I think that's more to do with the
maps<00:04:03.519> guys<00:04:03.790> honestly<00:04:04.090> the<00:04:04.599> new<00:04:05.199> maps<00:04:05.530> I<00:04:05.739> say

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.010 
maps guys honestly the new maps I say

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:07.800 
maps guys honestly the new maps I say
probably<00:04:06.340> has<00:04:06.519> a<00:04:06.549> little<00:04:06.790> bit<00:04:06.940> more<00:04:07.150> textures

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:07.810 
probably has a little bit more textures

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:09.839 
probably has a little bit more textures
in<00:04:07.989> them<00:04:08.139> I<00:04:08.319> would<00:04:08.620> have<00:04:08.739> to<00:04:08.859> say<00:04:08.889> the<00:04:09.010> 0<00:04:09.489> 2<00:04:09.609> 30

00:04:09.839 --> 00:04:09.849 
in them I would have to say the 0 2 30

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:11.789 
in them I would have to say the 0 2 30
map<00:04:10.120> so<00:04:10.389> maybe<00:04:10.660> that's<00:04:10.959> two<00:04:11.169> zipper<00:04:11.530> game

00:04:11.789 --> 00:04:11.799 
map so maybe that's two zipper game

00:04:11.799 --> 00:04:13.860 
map so maybe that's two zipper game
still<00:04:12.459> somewhat<00:04:12.910> looks<00:04:13.090> the<00:04:13.180> same<00:04:13.389> people

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:13.870 
still somewhat looks the same people

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:16.080 
still somewhat looks the same people
saying<00:04:14.139> better<00:04:14.379> hit<00:04:14.650> detection<00:04:14.829> still<00:04:15.760> seems

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:16.090 
saying better hit detection still seems

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:18.360 
saying better hit detection still seems
the<00:04:16.269> same<00:04:16.479> to<00:04:16.510> me<00:04:16.840> guys<00:04:17.079> and<00:04:17.530> they<00:04:17.859> run

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:18.370 
the same to me guys and they run

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:21.149 
the same to me guys and they run
smoother<00:04:18.940> it's<00:04:19.320> all<00:04:20.320> right<00:04:20.470> i<00:04:20.590> mean<00:04:20.680> all<00:04:21.070> in

00:04:21.149 --> 00:04:21.159 
smoother it's all right i mean all in

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:22.500 
smoother it's all right i mean all in
all<00:04:21.250> so<00:04:21.489> what's<00:04:21.669> the<00:04:21.760> saying<00:04:21.969> there<00:04:22.300> you<00:04:22.390> go

all so what's the saying there you go
prime<00:04:22.810> example<00:04:23.229> one<00:04:23.380> bug<00:04:23.620> right<00:04:23.800> there<00:04:24.010> guys

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:24.300 
prime example one bug right there guys

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.730 
prime example one bug right there guys
why<00:04:25.300> is<00:04:25.360> that<00:04:25.510> still<00:04:25.990> happening

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 
why is that still happening

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:29.430 
why is that still happening
after<00:04:27.220> a<00:04:27.250> patch<00:04:27.639> now<00:04:28.479> I<00:04:28.509> grant<00:04:28.870> he's<00:04:29.139> probably

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:29.440 
after a patch now I grant he's probably

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.920 
after a patch now I grant he's probably
maybe<00:04:30.009> he<00:04:30.220> was<00:04:30.400> calling<00:04:30.639> in<00:04:30.849> a<00:04:31.000> pact<00:04:31.300> oh<00:04:31.569> no<00:04:31.900> I

00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:31.930 
maybe he was calling in a pact oh no I

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:34.110 
maybe he was calling in a pact oh no I
patched<00:04:32.199> by<00:04:32.410> a<00:04:32.440> blackhawk<00:04:33.069> I'm<00:04:33.759> not<00:04:33.940> really

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:34.120 
patched by a blackhawk I'm not really

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:35.820 
patched by a blackhawk I'm not really
sure<00:04:34.270> where<00:04:34.690> his<00:04:34.840> case<00:04:35.080> was<00:04:35.289> but<00:04:35.500> the<00:04:35.620> fact

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:35.830 
sure where his case was but the fact

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:37.020 
sure where his case was but the fact
that<00:04:35.860> he<00:04:35.949> ended<00:04:36.250> up<00:04:36.370> up<00:04:36.580> there<00:04:36.789> and<00:04:36.910> he<00:04:37.000> was

00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:37.030 
that he ended up up there and he was

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:39.120 
that he ended up up there and he was
still<00:04:37.389> shooting<00:04:37.780> I'll<00:04:38.259> know<00:04:38.530> how<00:04:38.770> the<00:04:38.830> hell'd

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:39.130

still shooting I'll know how the hell'd
that<00:04:39.190> happen<00:04:39.310> I<00:04:39.639> just<00:04:39.669> had<00:04:40.120> to<00:04:40.150> lead<00:04:40.449> the<00:04:40.569> end

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:40.780

does<00:04:45.220> it<00:04:45.400> take<00:04:45.759> to<00:04:45.789> about<00:04:46.660> two<00:04:46.840> months<00:04:46.990> to<00:04:47.169> come

00:04:47.309 --> 00:04:47.319 
does it take to about two months to come

00:04:47.319 --> 00:04:49.620 
does it take to about two months to come
up<00:04:47.440> with<00:04:47.590> a<00:04:47.620> patch<00:04:47.919> and<00:04:48.310> it<00:04:49.030> still<00:04:49.479> doesn't

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:49.630 
up with a patch and it still doesn't

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:52.230 
up with a patch and it still doesn't
make<00:04:50.020> the<00:04:50.530> game<00:04:50.740> as<00:04:50.919> it<00:04:51.160> should<00:04:51.490> be<00:04:51.729> yes<00:04:52.060> they

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:52.240 
make the game as it should be yes they

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.210 
make the game as it should be yes they
brought<00:04:52.449> the<00:04:52.569> menus<00:04:52.990> and<00:04:53.229> stuff<00:04:53.349> in<00:04:53.710> the<00:04:53.979> hut

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:54.220 
brought the menus and stuff in the hut

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:56.700 
brought the menus and stuff in the hut
up<00:04:54.460> to<00:04:54.639> snap<00:04:54.940> but<00:04:55.150> that's<00:04:55.360> pretty<00:04:55.569> much<00:04:55.720> it<00:04:55.900> as

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:56.710 
up to snap but that's pretty much it as

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:59.399 
up to snap but that's pretty much it as
far<00:04:56.770> as<00:04:57.340> in<00:04:57.550> game<00:04:58.030> it<00:04:58.330> still<00:04:58.900> pretty<00:04:59.229> much

00:04:59.399 --> 00:04:59.409

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:55.270 
understand how you can come up with a

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:57.089 
understand how you can come up with a
patch<00:05:55.539> and<00:05:56.020> with<00:05:56.169> that<00:05:56.199> being<00:05:56.560> one<00:05:56.889> of<00:05:56.919> the

00:05:57.089 --> 00:05:57.099 
patch and with that being one of the

00:05:57.099 --> 00:05:58.439 
patch and with that being one of the
biggest<00:05:57.340> issues<00:05:57.849> people<00:05:58.000> have<00:05:58.300> been

00:05:58.439 --> 00:05:58.449 
biggest issues people have been

00:05:58.449 --> 00:06:00.870 
biggest issues people have been
complaining<00:05:58.659> about<00:05:59.440> the<00:05:59.800> voice<00:05:59.979> since<00:06:00.430> day

complaining about the voice since day

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:04.529 
complaining about the voice since day
one<00:06:01.419> day<00:06:02.349> one<00:06:02.380> and<00:06:02.979> it<00:06:03.280> still<00:06:03.729> has<00:06:04.000> not<00:06:04.270> been

00:06:04.529 --> 00:06:04.539 
one day one and it still has not been

00:06:04.539 --> 00:06:07.170 
one day one and it still has not been
fixed<00:06:04.900> at<00:06:05.289> I<00:06:05.590> don't<00:06:05.889> understand<00:06:06.520> that<00:06:06.759> that's

00:06:07.170 --> 00:06:07.180 
fixed at I don't understand that that's

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:09.240 
fixed at I don't understand that that's
probably<00:06:07.300> why<00:06:07.659> pc<00:06:08.289> ended<00:06:08.710> up<00:06:08.800> getting<00:06:09.159> that

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:09.250 
probably why pc ended up getting that

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:10.409 
probably why pc ended up getting that
delayed<00:06:09.669> because<00:06:09.849> they<00:06:10.030> were<00:06:10.120> supposed<00:06:10.330> to

00:06:10.409 --> 00:06:10.419 
delayed because they were supposed to

00:06:10.419 --> 00:06:12.899 
delayed because they were supposed to
get<00:06:10.539> it<00:06:10.659> on<00:06:10.780> the<00:06:10.900> 17<00:06:11.440> I<00:06:11.650> did<00:06:12.009> the<00:06:12.130> end<00:06:12.310> again<00:06:12.729> at

00:06:12.899 --> 00:06:12.909 
get it on the 17 I did the end again at

00:06:12.909 --> 00:06:15.809 
get it on the 17 I did the end again at
the<00:06:13.030> same<00:06:13.270> day<00:06:13.539> we<00:06:13.800> ps3<00:06:14.800> and<00:06:14.919> xbox<00:06:15.280> users<00:06:15.639> dead

00:06:15.809 --> 00:06:15.819 
the same day we ps3 and xbox users dead

00:06:15.819 --> 00:06:17.790 
the same day we ps3 and xbox users dead
so<00:06:16.090> that's<00:06:16.569> probably<00:06:16.840> why<00:06:17.169> they<00:06:17.469> knew<00:06:17.770> that

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:17.800 
so that's probably why they knew that

00:06:17.800 --> 00:06:19.499 
so that's probably why they knew that
the<00:06:18.069> patch<00:06:18.280> still<00:06:18.610> has<00:06:18.789> some<00:06:18.969> problems<00:06:19.389> they

00:06:19.499 --> 00:06:19.509 
the patch still has some problems they

00:06:19.509 --> 00:06:21.899 
the patch still has some problems they
