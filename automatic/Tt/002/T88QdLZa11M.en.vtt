course by that time you are most likely

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.439 
course by that time you are most likely
dead<00:00:49.440> so<00:00:49.559> really<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:49.920> army<00:00:50.399> ant<00:00:50.610> or<00:00:50.940> soldier

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
dead so really the army ant or soldier

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.389 
dead so really the army ant or soldier
and<00:00:51.660> these<00:00:51.989> ants<00:00:52.289> aren't<00:00:52.500> only<00:00:52.770> freakishly

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
and these ants aren't only freakishly

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.369 
and these ants aren't only freakishly
big<00:00:53.610> in<00:00:53.910> size<00:00:54.149> like<00:00:54.480> making<00:00:54.780> grew<00:00:54.930> up<00:00:55.020> to<00:00:55.170> half

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
big in size like making grew up to half

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.650 
big in size like making grew up to half
an<00:00:55.590> inch<00:00:55.890> but<00:00:56.309> they<00:00:56.430> also<00:00:56.579> travel<00:00:56.940> around<00:00:57.300> as

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
an inch but they also travel around as

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.930 
an inch but they also travel around as

one giant battalion seen from a distance

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:01.400 
one giant battalion seen from a distance
it<00:01:00.030> actually<00:01:00.059> looks<00:01:00.570> like<00:01:00.690> one<00:01:01.020> giant

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410

it's<00:01:03.629> actually<00:01:03.989> an<00:01:04.110> army<00:01:04.530> of<00:01:04.680> hundreds<00:01:05.129> of

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
it's actually an army of hundreds of

thousands of ants they also hook into
each<00:01:07.530> other<00:01:07.770> to<00:01:07.979> create<00:01:08.250> structures<00:01:08.880> like

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
each other to create structures like

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.090 
each other to create structures like
bridges<00:01:09.360> and<00:01:09.869> walls<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.439> only<00:01:10.710> good<00:01:10.860> thing

the<00:02:03.119> scary<00:02:03.390> thing<00:02:03.600> is<00:02:03.689> if<00:02:03.780> this<00:02:03.869> does<00:02:04.079> not<00:02:04.110> just

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
the scary thing is if this does not just

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:05.899 
the scary thing is if this does not just
happen<00:02:04.770> to<00:02:04.860> animals<00:02:05.040> but<00:02:05.490> had<00:02:05.610> also<00:02:05.820> been

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:05.909 
happen to animals but had also been

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:07.789 
happen to animals but had also been
known<00:02:06.149> to<00:02:06.180> happen<00:02:06.509> to<00:02:06.840> humans<00:02:07.259> so<00:02:07.409> you<00:02:07.469> think

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
known to happen to humans so you think

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:09.440 
known to happen to humans so you think
these<00:02:08.009> larvae<00:02:08.369> are<00:02:08.550> small<00:02:08.879> like<00:02:09.149> almost

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
these larvae are small like almost

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:10.910 
these larvae are small like almost

invisible to the naked eye

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.470 
invisible to the naked eye
so<00:02:11.220> it<00:02:11.340> wouldn't<00:02:11.610> be<00:02:11.700> that<00:02:11.850> big<00:02:12.000> of<00:02:12.120> a<00:02:12.180> deal<00:02:12.360> but

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:12.480 
so it wouldn't be that big of a deal but

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.330 
so it wouldn't be that big of a deal but
unfortunately<00:02:13.140> they<00:02:13.319> are<00:02:13.440> freaking<00:02:13.890> huge

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
unfortunately they are freaking huge

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:15.949
