so we're gonna get into general care
today<00:00:03.030> we're<00:00:03.810> gonna<00:00:03.899> start<00:00:04.020> with<00:00:04.440> the<00:00:04.650> bottom

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.040 
today we're gonna start with the bottom

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.740 
today we're gonna start with the bottom
all<00:00:05.220> the<00:00:05.279> way<00:00:05.400> up<00:00:05.580> to<00:00:05.700> the<00:00:05.790> top<00:00:05.970> of<00:00:06.120> the<00:00:06.180> colony

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750 
all the way up to the top of the colony

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.059 
all the way up to the top of the colony
so<00:00:06.930> what<00:00:07.259> we're<00:00:07.379> first<00:00:07.529> going<00:00:07.740> to<00:00:07.830> talk<00:00:07.950> about

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:08.069 
so what we're first going to talk about

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:10.669 
so what we're first going to talk about
is<00:00:08.309> heating<00:00:08.840> you<00:00:09.840> want<00:00:09.990> to<00:00:10.050> keep<00:00:10.170> your<00:00:10.349> Dubya

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
is heating you want to keep your Dubya

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.419 
is heating you want to keep your Dubya
at<00:00:10.830> about<00:00:11.099> 85<00:00:11.790> to<00:00:11.820> 90<00:00:12.450> degrees<00:00:12.780> and<00:00:13.769> you<00:00:14.309> can

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
at about 85 to 90 degrees and you can

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:15.829 
at about 85 to 90 degrees and you can
achieve<00:00:14.580> that<00:00:14.940> by<00:00:15.000> a<00:00:15.150> few<00:00:15.389> different<00:00:15.480> ways<00:00:15.780> you

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:15.839 
achieve that by a few different ways you

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:17.750 
achieve that by a few different ways you
can<00:00:16.289> heat<00:00:16.590> the<00:00:16.740> entire<00:00:17.039> room<00:00:17.369> they're<00:00:17.609> in

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
can heat the entire room they're in

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.130 
can heat the entire room they're in
or<00:00:18.000> if<00:00:18.090> they're<00:00:18.240> in<00:00:18.270> the<00:00:18.420> hot<00:00:18.630> room<00:00:18.869> to<00:00:19.050> begin

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
or if they're in the hot room to begin

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.310 
or if they're in the hot room to begin
with<00:00:19.470> and<00:00:19.949> I<00:00:20.070> mean<00:00:20.220> hot<00:00:20.460> as<00:00:20.730> in<00:00:20.939> 76<00:00:21.630> degrees

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
with and I mean hot as in 76 degrees

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.529 
with and I mean hot as in 76 degrees
they<00:00:22.830> will<00:00:23.010> sustain<00:00:23.340> and<00:00:23.939> they<00:00:24.029> will<00:00:24.210> grow<00:00:24.390> at

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
they will sustain and they will grow at

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.529 
they will sustain and they will grow at
a<00:00:24.600> steady<00:00:24.990> pace<00:00:25.140> like<00:00:25.859> that<00:00:26.180> that<00:00:27.180> won't<00:00:27.390> be<00:00:27.510> a

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
a steady pace like that that won't be a

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.720 
a steady pace like that that won't be a
problem<00:00:27.599> but<00:00:28.199> if<00:00:28.349> you<00:00:28.560> need<00:00:29.039> to<00:00:29.189> accelerate

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
make sure it stays dry and when I stays

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.929 
make sure it stays dry and when I stays
dry<00:01:31.170> the<00:01:31.320> only<00:01:31.530> thing<00:01:31.680> to<00:01:31.710> really<00:01:31.979> counter

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
dry the only thing to really counter

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.670 
dry the only thing to really counter
that<00:01:33.090> is<00:01:33.270> the<00:01:33.420> fruit<00:01:33.659> make<00:01:34.020> sure<00:01:34.170> it<00:01:34.259> has<00:01:34.409> a<00:01:34.439> lip

on<00:01:34.860> the<00:01:34.950> container<00:01:35.810> so<00:01:36.810> we<00:01:36.930> use<00:01:37.049> the<00:01:37.229> tops<00:01:37.439> to

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
on the container so we use the tops to

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.120 
on the container so we use the tops to
make<00:01:37.890> sure<00:01:38.130> that<00:01:38.729> fruit<00:01:39.450> juice<00:01:39.720> stays<00:01:40.229> in<00:01:40.560> the

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130 
make sure that fruit juice stays in the

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:43.039 
make sure that fruit juice stays in the
colony<00:01:41.520> you<00:01:42.000> don't<00:01:42.270> want<00:01:42.450> it<00:01:42.509> getting<00:01:42.630> out<00:01:42.869> it

colony you don't want it getting out it

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.039 
colony you don't want it getting out it
will<00:01:43.170> cause<00:01:43.740> mold<00:01:43.979> and<00:01:44.310> it<00:01:44.759> will<00:01:45.060> wipe<00:01:45.930> out

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
will cause mold and it will wipe out

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.069 
we keep it in another container we use a
high<00:01:52.710> end<00:01:52.950> on<00:01:53.130> one<00:01:53.369> one<00:01:54.000> side<00:01:54.270> and<00:01:54.600> a<00:01:54.720> low<00:01:54.899> end

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
high end on one one side and a low end

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.990 
high end on one one side and a low end
on<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.320> other

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.000 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.480 

and<00:01:58.870> if<00:01:59.170> you<00:01:59.290> can<00:01:59.440> see<00:01:59.620> that<00:01:59.800> it<00:02:00.010> basically

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
and if you can see that it basically

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:03.000 
and if you can see that it basically
allows<00:02:00.910> the<00:02:01.390> babies<00:02:01.780> to<00:02:02.110> get<00:02:02.320> in<00:02:02.470> the<00:02:02.650> one<00:02:02.830> end

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:03.010 
allows the babies to get in the one end

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:05.070 
allows the babies to get in the one end
and<00:02:03.220> eat<00:02:03.880> as<00:02:04.000> much<00:02:04.150> as<00:02:04.330> they<00:02:04.450> need<00:02:04.480> and<00:02:04.840> walk

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:05.080 
and eat as much as they need and walk

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:07.710 
and eat as much as they need and walk
right<00:02:05.260> out<00:02:05.580> and<00:02:06.580> then<00:02:06.760> the<00:02:06.940> other<00:02:06.970> high-end<00:02:07.570> is

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720 
right out and then the other high-end is

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:08.969 
right out and then the other high-end is
just<00:02:07.990> so<00:02:08.080> we<00:02:08.259> can<00:02:08.350> get<00:02:08.530> a<00:02:08.560> little<00:02:08.710> bit<00:02:08.830> more

00:02:08.969 --> 00:02:08.979 
just so we can get a little bit more

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:11.910 
just so we can get a little bit more
food<00:02:09.190> in<00:02:09.369> there<00:02:09.840> for<00:02:10.840> humidity<00:02:11.320> we<00:02:11.710> missed

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920 
food in there for humidity we missed

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.940 
food in there for humidity we missed
once<00:02:12.190> a<00:02:12.280> day<00:02:12.660> and<00:02:13.660> we<00:02:14.050> do<00:02:14.320> that<00:02:14.470> simply<00:02:14.800> because

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
once a day and we do that simply because

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:17.850 
once a day and we do that simply because
it's<00:02:15.160> not<00:02:15.430> necessary<00:02:16.060> to<00:02:16.120> do<00:02:16.270> otherwise<00:02:16.860> and

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:17.860 
it's not necessary to do otherwise and

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.060 
it's not necessary to do otherwise and
the<00:02:18.310> more<00:02:18.520> we<00:02:18.670> come<00:02:18.790> up<00:02:18.970> here<00:02:19.000> to<00:02:19.210> disturb<00:02:19.690> them

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:20.070 
the more we come up here to disturb them

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:23.040 
the more we come up here to disturb them
the<00:02:21.070> less<00:02:21.250> they'll<00:02:21.520> eat<00:02:21.760> so<00:02:22.570> the<00:02:22.720> less<00:02:22.840> they'll

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
the less they'll eat so the less they'll

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.860 
the less they'll eat so the less they'll
grow<00:02:23.290> breed<00:02:24.130> and<00:02:24.660> get<00:02:25.660> to<00:02:25.750> the

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
grow breed and get to the

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.420 
grow breed and get to the
extracurricular<00:02:26.410> activities<00:02:27.010> that<00:02:27.160> we<00:02:27.280> need

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
extracurricular activities that we need

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.650 
extracurricular activities that we need
them<00:02:27.640> do<00:02:29.459> now<00:02:30.459> this<00:02:30.790> is<00:02:30.940> one<00:02:31.090> of<00:02:31.120> our<00:02:31.270> smaller

by<00:03:12.880> a<00:03:13.060> hypo<00:03:13.680> if<00:03:14.680> you<00:03:14.920> look<00:03:15.250> at<00:03:15.400> it<00:03:16.110> of<00:03:17.110> course<00:03:17.290> my

take about a year to get a super-duper
result<00:03:46.150> but<00:03:46.360> it'll<00:03:46.570> be<00:03:46.690> well<00:03:46.900> worth<00:03:46.930> it

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:48.000 
result but it'll be well worth it

drying it out would take care of any
bacterial<00:04:10.049> issues<00:04:10.409> but<00:04:10.680> I<00:04:10.920> would<00:04:11.219> buy<00:04:11.670> them

00:04:11.839 --> 00:04:11.849 
bacterial issues but I would buy them

bacterial issues but I would buy them
fresh<00:04:12.120> they're<00:04:12.930> really<00:04:13.349> cheap<00:04:14.000> and<00:04:15.000> so<00:04:15.440> twelve

together what I mean by that is you can

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:08.180 
together what I mean by that is you can
have<00:05:06.090> active<00:05:06.780> adults<00:05:06.990> breeding<00:05:07.650> and<00:05:07.889> the<00:05:07.919> same

00:05:13.129 --> 00:05:13.139 
them separated you can do it in one just

00:05:13.139 --> 00:05:15.680 
them separated you can do it in one just
it's<00:05:13.380> not<00:05:14.039> beneficial<00:05:14.789> to<00:05:14.970> have<00:05:15.120> that<00:05:15.330> happen
