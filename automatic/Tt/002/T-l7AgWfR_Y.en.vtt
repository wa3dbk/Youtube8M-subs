please keep watching so the first thing

00:00:56.089 --> 00:00:58.689 
please keep watching so the first thing
I<00:00:56.269> would<00:00:56.329> do<00:00:56.660> is<00:00:56.870> probably<00:00:57.499> sort<00:00:58.160> out<00:00:58.280> my<00:00:58.309> eyes

00:00:58.689 --> 00:00:58.699 
I would do is probably sort out my eyes

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:01.599

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:04.420

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:39.710 
experience here when I am really in a

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:44.230 
experience here when I am really in a
rush<00:02:39.830> I<00:02:41.410> go<00:02:42.410> for<00:02:42.770> the<00:02:42.890> smudging<00:02:43.760> technique

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:44.240 
rush I go for the smudging technique

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.290 
rush I go for the smudging technique
because<00:02:44.690> it's<00:02:44.840> just<00:02:45.050> easier<00:02:45.620> and<00:02:46.030> if<00:02:47.030> I'm

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:47.300 
because it's just easier and if I'm

00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:52.000 
because it's just easier and if I'm
stressed<00:02:48.670> I'm<00:02:49.870> just<00:02:50.870> no<00:02:51.140> good<00:02:51.170> at<00:02:51.530> liquid

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
stressed I'm just no good at liquid

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.070 
stressed I'm just no good at liquid
liner<00:02:52.340> if<00:02:52.700> I'm<00:02:52.880> stressed<00:02:53.210> I<00:02:53.480> just<00:02:53.630> cannot

liner if I'm stressed I just cannot

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.290 
liner if I'm stressed I just cannot
because<00:02:55.040> I'm<00:02:55.160> so<00:02:55.340> worried<00:02:55.700> about<00:02:55.850> getting<00:02:56.060> it

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:56.300 
because I'm so worried about getting it

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:59.860 
because I'm so worried about getting it
right<00:02:57.490> then<00:02:58.490> it<00:02:58.610> goes<00:02:58.760> wrong<00:02:59.090> half<00:02:59.510> of<00:02:59.750> the

00:02:59.860 --> 00:02:59.870 
right then it goes wrong half of the

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:01.720 
right then it goes wrong half of the
time<00:03:00.050> so<00:03:00.620> this<00:03:00.980> is<00:03:01.040> just<00:03:01.310> going<00:03:01.520> to<00:03:01.610> go<00:03:01.700> through

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730 
time so this is just going to go through

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:07.750 
time so this is just going to go through
my<00:03:02.600> top<00:03:02.810> lash<00:03:03.110> line<00:03:04.390> and<00:03:06.250> then<00:03:07.250> with<00:03:07.460> a<00:03:07.490> mac

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:07.760 
my top lash line and then with a mac

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.150 
my top lash line and then with a mac
pencil<00:03:08.300> brush<00:03:08.480> this<00:03:08.930> is<00:03:09.140> just<00:03:09.410> been<00:03:09.590> smudged

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160 
pencil brush this is just been smudged

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:21.290

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.240 

and<00:03:21.780> then<00:03:22.140> you<00:03:22.230> kind<00:03:22.440> of<00:03:22.500> have<00:03:22.650> an<00:03:22.770> instant

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:23.250 
and then you kind of have an instant

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:25.550 
and then you kind of have an instant
smoky<00:03:23.730> eye<00:03:23.760> just<00:03:24.450> to<00:03:24.600> top<00:03:24.810> it<00:03:24.960> off<00:03:25.140> if<00:03:25.500> you
