00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:07.840 

I'll<00:00:06.860> give<00:00:06.980> you<00:00:07.070> a<00:00:07.100> little<00:00:07.220> update<00:00:07.400> on<00:00:07.640> my

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:07.850 
I'll give you a little update on my

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:09.670 
I'll give you a little update on my
machine<00:00:08.000> here<00:00:08.450> a<00:00:08.780> few<00:00:09.050> of<00:00:09.139> the<00:00:09.230> changes<00:00:09.559> have

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:09.680 
machine here a few of the changes have

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:12.160 
machine here a few of the changes have
had<00:00:09.800> to<00:00:09.920> make<00:00:10.010> along<00:00:10.250> the<00:00:10.309> way<00:00:10.430> I<00:00:11.389> had<00:00:11.900> to<00:00:12.020> put<00:00:12.139> a

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:12.170 
had to make along the way I had to put a

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:14.560 
had to make along the way I had to put a
stronger<00:00:12.860> spring<00:00:13.130> in<00:00:13.370> so<00:00:13.640> that<00:00:13.940> I<00:00:13.970> get<00:00:14.300> much

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:14.570 
stronger spring in so that I get much

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:16.390 
stronger spring in so that I get much
stronger<00:00:15.019> pulsing<00:00:15.650> going<00:00:15.890> on<00:00:16.040> a<00:00:16.160> little<00:00:16.309> bit

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:16.400 
stronger pulsing going on a little bit

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.929 
stronger pulsing going on a little bit
more<00:00:16.520> pressure<00:00:16.760> and<00:00:17.119> stronger<00:00:18.050> pulses<00:00:18.470> i've

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:18.939 
more pressure and stronger pulses i've

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:22.510 
more pressure and stronger pulses i've
had<00:00:19.939> to<00:00:20.119> extend<00:00:20.689> the<00:00:20.900> hopper<00:00:21.440> up<00:00:21.619> just<00:00:22.310> a

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:22.520 
had to extend the hopper up just a

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.040 
had to extend the hopper up just a
little<00:00:22.550> bit<00:00:22.789> because<00:00:23.240> I<00:00:23.420> was<00:00:23.539> having<00:00:23.660> water

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:24.050 
little bit because I was having water

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:26.470 
little bit because I was having water
splashing<00:00:24.710> at<00:00:24.800> the<00:00:24.890> top<00:00:25.130> it's<00:00:26.090> a<00:00:26.150> little<00:00:26.390> bit

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:26.480 
splashing at the top it's a little bit

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.189 
splashing at the top it's a little bit
of<00:00:26.539> an<00:00:26.600> extension<00:00:27.050> on<00:00:27.110> the<00:00:27.199> hopper<00:00:29.020> have<00:00:30.020> to

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:30.199 
of an extension on the hopper have to

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:33.340 
of an extension on the hopper have to
completely<00:00:30.740> redesign<00:00:31.609> the<00:00:32.119> capture<00:00:32.960> chamber

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:33.350 
completely redesign the capture chamber

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:35.920 
completely redesign the capture chamber
down<00:00:33.470> here<00:00:33.830> with<00:00:34.010> a<00:00:34.040> bigger<00:00:34.430> valve<00:00:34.970> and<00:00:35.570> a

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:35.930 
down here with a bigger valve and a

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.500 
down here with a bigger valve and a
bigger<00:00:36.140> vial<00:00:36.650> air<00:00:37.340> was<00:00:37.640> getting<00:00:37.940> caught<00:00:38.270> as

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:38.510 
bigger vial air was getting caught as

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:40.930 
bigger vial air was getting caught as
the<00:00:39.020> valve<00:00:39.200> opened<00:00:39.710> and<00:00:39.829> went<00:00:40.010> past<00:00:40.340> through

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:40.940 
the valve opened and went past through

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.389 
the valve opened and went past through
and<00:00:41.239> let<00:00:41.540> the<00:00:41.690> water<00:00:41.870> down<00:00:42.170> in<00:00:42.470> with<00:00:42.920> the<00:00:43.070> small

00:00:43.389 --> 00:00:43.399 
and let the water down in with the small

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:45.580 
and let the water down in with the small
quarter-inch<00:00:43.910> valve<00:00:44.180> so<00:00:44.719> I've<00:00:44.899> got<00:00:45.050> 3/4<00:00:45.469> inch

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:45.590 
quarter-inch valve so I've got 3/4 inch

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:46.959 
quarter-inch valve so I've got 3/4 inch
valve<00:00:45.770> in<00:00:45.950> here<00:00:46.160> and<00:00:46.280> now<00:00:46.370> when<00:00:46.520> you<00:00:46.550> open<00:00:46.880> it

00:00:46.959 --> 00:00:46.969 
valve in here and now when you open it

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:49.270 
valve in here and now when you open it
the<00:00:47.300> vial<00:00:47.510> fills<00:00:47.780> up<00:00:47.930> with<00:00:47.960> water<00:00:48.079> and<00:00:48.530> because

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:49.280 
the vial fills up with water and because

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:50.740 
the vial fills up with water and because
the<00:00:49.430> air<00:00:49.550> wasn't<00:00:49.910> getting<00:00:50.149> out<00:00:50.239> the<00:00:50.480> sands

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:50.750 
the air wasn't getting out the sands

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:52.299 
the air wasn't getting out the sands
weren't<00:00:51.079> going<00:00:51.290> down<00:00:51.440> into<00:00:51.829> the<00:00:51.950> vial<00:00:52.190> the

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:52.309 
weren't going down into the vial the

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:56.580 
weren't going down into the vial the
smaller<00:00:52.700> vial<00:00:52.969> big<00:00:53.570> your<00:00:53.690> vial<00:00:53.899> work<00:00:54.290> a<00:00:54.320> nicer

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:56.590 
smaller vial big your vial work a nicer

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:59.830 
smaller vial big your vial work a nicer
also<00:00:57.590> the<00:00:57.829> valve<00:00:58.219> I'm<00:00:58.879> having<00:00:59.480> problems<00:00:59.600> with

00:00:59.830 --> 00:00:59.840 
also the valve I'm having problems with

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.150 
also the valve I'm having problems with
and<00:01:00.079> I'm<00:01:00.140> probably<00:01:00.320> going<00:01:00.530> to<00:01:00.620> have<00:01:00.680> to<00:01:00.800> change

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:01.160 
and I'm probably going to have to change

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.049 
and I'm probably going to have to change
it<00:01:01.340> again<00:01:01.760> as<00:01:02.559> I<00:01:03.559> can't<00:01:03.829> pass<00:01:04.100> water<00:01:04.460> backwards

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:05.059 
it again as I can't pass water backwards

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:07.359 
it again as I can't pass water backwards
through<00:01:06.050> one<00:01:06.229> of<00:01:06.259> these<00:01:06.380> valves<00:01:06.680> nicely<00:01:07.250> I

00:01:07.359 --> 00:01:07.369 
through one of these valves nicely I

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:11.790 
through one of these valves nicely I
thought<00:01:07.550> I<00:01:07.580> could<00:01:07.850> it's<00:01:08.300> not<00:01:08.479> going<00:01:08.660> to<00:01:08.720> work

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:11.800 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.260 

now<00:01:12.800> so<00:01:13.039> far<00:01:13.250> I've<00:01:13.310> just<00:01:13.429> been<00:01:13.670> hooking<00:01:13.880> up<00:01:14.090> to

00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:14.270 
now so far I've just been hooking up to

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.090 
now so far I've just been hooking up to
city<00:01:14.479> water<00:01:14.780> pressure<00:01:15.080> just<00:01:15.590> on<00:01:15.740> a<00:01:15.770> regular

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:16.100 
city water pressure just on a regular

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.230 
city water pressure just on a regular
hose<00:01:16.459> Bibb<00:01:17.770> the<00:01:18.770> pump<00:01:19.069> I<00:01:19.280> had<00:01:19.610> was<00:01:20.000> not

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:20.240 
hose Bibb the pump I had was not

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:21.969 
hose Bibb the pump I had was not
powerful<00:01:21.229> enough<00:01:21.410> didn't<00:01:21.740> have<00:01:21.830> enough

00:01:21.969 --> 00:01:21.979 
powerful enough didn't have enough

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:26.260 
powerful enough didn't have enough
pressure<00:01:22.310> to<00:01:22.670> get<00:01:23.090> the<00:01:23.330> pulse<00:01:24.050> valve<00:01:25.270> pulsing

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:26.270 
pressure to get the pulse valve pulsing

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.529 
pressure to get the pulse valve pulsing
nicely<00:01:26.950> so<00:01:27.950> I've<00:01:28.130> ordered<00:01:28.340> a<00:01:28.520> new<00:01:28.789> pump<00:01:29.300> that

00:01:29.529 --> 00:01:29.539 
nicely so I've ordered a new pump that

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:32.859 
nicely so I've ordered a new pump that
has<00:01:29.660> higher<00:01:29.929> pressure<00:01:30.380> and<00:01:31.660> hopefully<00:01:32.660> that

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:32.869 
has higher pressure and hopefully that

00:01:32.869 --> 00:01:35.199 
has higher pressure and hopefully that
will<00:01:33.110> pulse<00:01:33.500> it<00:01:33.709> nicely<00:01:33.950> but<00:01:34.340> so<00:01:34.610> far<00:01:34.910> I'm<00:01:35.179> just

00:01:35.199 --> 00:01:35.209 
will pulse it nicely but so far I'm just

00:01:35.209 --> 00:01:39.550 
will pulse it nicely but so far I'm just
testing<00:01:35.810> it<00:01:35.869> on<00:01:36.050> city<00:01:36.380> water<00:01:36.470> pressure<00:01:38.560> now

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:39.560 
testing it on city water pressure now

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.040 
testing it on city water pressure now
also<00:01:39.800> the<00:01:40.220> copper<00:01:40.970> coated<00:01:41.270> steel<00:01:41.450> shot<00:01:41.780> I<00:01:41.810> was

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:42.050 
also the copper coated steel shot I was

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:44.830 
also the copper coated steel shot I was
using<00:01:42.440> I<00:01:42.619> found<00:01:43.069> rust<00:01:43.429> almost<00:01:44.270> instantly

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:44.840 
using I found rust almost instantly

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.240 
using I found rust almost instantly
putting<00:01:45.200> in<00:01:45.289> water<00:01:45.470> even<00:01:45.890> though<00:01:45.979> it's<00:01:46.069> copper

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
putting in water even though it's copper

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.650 
putting in water even though it's copper
coated<00:01:46.700> so<00:01:47.360> I<00:01:47.390> have<00:01:47.750> ordered<00:01:48.140> some<00:01:48.849> brass<00:01:49.849> shot

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:50.660 
coated so I have ordered some brass shot

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:54.580 
coated so I have ordered some brass shot
to<00:01:51.289> go<00:01:51.440> in<00:01:51.649> the<00:01:52.580> jig<00:01:52.849> bed<00:01:53.090> now<00:01:53.899> I<00:01:53.929> decided<00:01:54.380> to<00:01:54.500> go

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
to go in the jig bed now I decided to go

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.710 
to go in the jig bed now I decided to go
with<00:01:54.619> brass<00:01:55.069> because<00:01:55.429> brass<00:01:55.849> is<00:01:56.209> specific

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:56.720 
with brass because brass is specific

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:59.199 
with brass because brass is specific
gravity<00:01:57.110> is<00:01:57.140> slightly<00:01:58.130> heavier<00:01:58.580> than<00:01:58.640> steel

00:01:59.199 --> 00:01:59.209 
gravity is slightly heavier than steel

00:01:59.209 --> 00:02:01.900 
gravity is slightly heavier than steel
so<00:02:00.020> hopefully<00:02:00.709> it'll<00:02:01.099> help<00:02:01.340> keep<00:02:01.580> the<00:02:01.729> black

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:01.910 
so hopefully it'll help keep the black

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:05.289 
so hopefully it'll help keep the black
sands<00:02:02.420> above<00:02:02.869> the<00:02:03.080> shot
