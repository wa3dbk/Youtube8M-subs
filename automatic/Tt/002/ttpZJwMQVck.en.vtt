hey<00:00:02.030> I'm<00:00:03.030> mr.<00:00:03.540> o<00:00:03.659> here<00:00:04.470> with<00:00:04.620> another<00:00:06.290> moment

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:07.290 
hey I'm mr. o here with another moment

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.339 
hey I'm mr. o here with another moment
at<00:00:07.560> the<00:00:08.010> Children's<00:00:08.610> Museum<00:00:09.120> in<00:00:09.269> Houston<00:00:09.750> Wow

00:00:12.339 --> 00:00:12.349 
at the Children's Museum in Houston Wow

00:00:12.349 --> 00:00:14.660 
at the Children's Museum in Houston Wow
so<00:00:13.349> I<00:00:13.380> see<00:00:13.590> you<00:00:13.679> all<00:00:13.799> found<00:00:13.980> our<00:00:14.219> conductivity

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
so I see you all found our conductivity

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.000 
so I see you all found our conductivity
tester<00:00:15.269> yeah<00:00:15.839> we<00:00:16.109> figured<00:00:16.289> out<00:00:16.529> that<00:00:16.710> the<00:00:16.800> goal

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
tester yeah we figured out that the goal

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.859 
tester yeah we figured out that the goal
is<00:00:17.250> to<00:00:17.400> complete<00:00:17.520> the<00:00:17.820> circuit<00:00:18.270> around<00:00:18.720> the

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
is to complete the circuit around the

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.630 
is to complete the circuit around the
path<00:00:19.080> and<00:00:19.500> that<00:00:19.890> metal<00:00:20.220> allows<00:00:20.490> the

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:20.640 
path and that metal allows the

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.700 
path and that metal allows the
electricity<00:00:21.119> to<00:00:21.270> flow<00:00:21.300> through<00:00:21.660> the<00:00:21.720> path<00:00:21.930> but

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
electricity to flow through the path but

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.439 
electricity to flow through the path but
what<00:00:22.920> I<00:00:22.949> don't<00:00:23.070> get<00:00:23.369> is<00:00:23.430> why<00:00:23.789> metal<00:00:24.240> works

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
what I don't get is why metal works

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.689 
what I don't get is why metal works
better<00:00:24.750> well<00:00:25.880> let<00:00:26.880> me<00:00:27.000> explain<00:00:27.060> it<00:00:27.359> this<00:00:27.480> way

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:28.699 
better well let me explain it this way

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:31.250 
better well let me explain it this way
conductivity<00:00:29.699> is<00:00:29.970> a<00:00:30.000> property<00:00:30.390> of<00:00:30.480> matter<00:00:30.720> in

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
conductivity is a property of matter in

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.080 
conductivity is a property of matter in
other<00:00:31.410> words<00:00:31.650> some<00:00:31.949> materials<00:00:32.430> naturally

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:33.090 
other words some materials naturally

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.760 
other words some materials naturally
allow<00:00:33.300> electricity<00:00:33.540> to<00:00:33.960> flow<00:00:34.079> through<00:00:34.590> them

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
allow electricity to flow through them

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.950 
allow electricity to flow through them
mostly<00:00:35.309> metals<00:00:35.790> if<00:00:35.969> you<00:00:36.480> look<00:00:36.600> down<00:00:36.809> the

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
mostly metals if you look down the

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.360 
mostly metals if you look down the
center<00:00:37.290> of<00:00:37.320> this<00:00:37.500> tube<00:00:37.770> it's<00:00:37.980> hollow<00:00:38.219> inside

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
center of this tube it's hollow inside

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:40.940 
center of this tube it's hollow inside
so<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.360> beads<00:00:39.600> can<00:00:39.870> easily<00:00:40.260> pour<00:00:40.500> through<00:00:40.800> it

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:40.950 
so the beads can easily pour through it

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:43.130 
so the beads can easily pour through it
in<00:00:41.129> other<00:00:41.790> words<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:42.270> property<00:00:42.750> of<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:42.930> tube

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
in other words the property of the tube

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.350 
in other words the property of the tube
allows<00:00:43.590> the<00:00:43.890> beads<00:00:44.100> to<00:00:44.370> flow<00:00:44.640> like<00:00:45.239> the

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.360 
allows the beads to flow like the

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.330 
allows the beads to flow like the
property<00:00:45.570> of<00:00:45.750> metals<00:00:46.170> allows<00:00:46.530> electricity<00:00:47.190> to

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
property of metals allows electricity to

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.490 
property of metals allows electricity to
flow<00:00:47.480> some<00:00:48.480> materials<00:00:48.989> like<00:00:49.170> when<00:00:49.350> and

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
flow some materials like when and

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.380 
flow some materials like when and
plastic<00:00:49.950> are<00:00:50.100> like<00:00:50.250> this<00:00:50.370> other<00:00:50.610> tube<00:00:50.879> if<00:00:51.149> you

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
plastic are like this other tube if you

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:52.880 
plastic are like this other tube if you
look<00:00:51.539> down<00:00:51.750> it<00:00:51.960> you<00:00:52.050> can<00:00:52.199> see<00:00:52.350> it<00:00:52.379> is<00:00:52.530> blocked

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
look down it you can see it is blocked

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:55.250 
look down it you can see it is blocked
so<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.579> beads<00:00:53.820> don't<00:00:54.149> flow<00:00:54.420> through<00:00:54.780> when

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
so the beads don't flow through when

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:56.510 
so the beads don't flow through when
electricity<00:00:55.649> cannot<00:00:56.100> flow<00:00:56.280> through<00:00:56.460> a

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
electricity cannot flow through a

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.069 
electricity cannot flow through a
material<00:00:57.059> it<00:00:57.270> is<00:00:57.360> said<00:00:57.600> to<00:00:57.629> have<00:00:57.809> non

material it is said to have non
conductive<00:00:58.710> properties<00:00:59.420> electricity<00:01:00.420> is

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
conductive properties electricity is

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.360 
conductive properties electricity is
unable<00:01:00.840> to<00:01:01.079> flow<00:01:01.289> through<00:01:01.620> non<00:01:01.859> conductive

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
unable to flow through non conductive

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.520 
unable to flow through non conductive
materials<00:01:02.910> like<00:01:03.090> when<00:01:03.300> in<00:01:03.420> plastic<00:01:03.899> just<00:01:04.409> like

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
materials like when in plastic just like

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.020 
materials like when in plastic just like
the<00:01:04.650> property<00:01:05.040> of<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.189> second<00:01:05.519> tube<00:01:05.640> prevents

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
the property of the second tube prevents

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.090 
the property of the second tube prevents
beads<00:01:06.299> from<00:01:06.510> flowing<00:01:06.960> through<00:01:07.140> it<00:01:07.320> let<00:01:08.010> me

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
beads from flowing through it let me

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.250 
beads from flowing through it let me
show<00:01:08.280> it<00:01:08.310> to<00:01:08.400> you<00:01:08.520> a<00:01:08.580> different<00:01:08.850> way<00:01:09.260> science

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
show it to you a different way science

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.050 
show it to you a different way science
is<00:01:10.350> fun<00:01:10.409> but<00:01:10.830> can<00:01:10.979> also<00:01:11.100> be<00:01:11.430> dangerous<00:01:11.610> so

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:12.060 
is fun but can also be dangerous so

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.359 
is fun but can also be dangerous so
always<00:01:12.330> have<00:01:12.750> a<00:01:12.960> responsible<00:01:13.650> adult<00:01:13.740> helping

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
always have a responsible adult helping
