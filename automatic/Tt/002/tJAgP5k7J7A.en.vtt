okay so then now you fold this left into
the<00:01:39.270> third<00:01:39.540> line<00:01:40.020> and<00:01:40.800> make<00:01:41.010> a<00:01:41.040> crease<00:01:41.340> and

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
the third line and make a crease and

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.030 
the third line and make a crease and
once<00:01:42.480> you<00:01:42.660> have<00:01:42.780> done<00:01:42.960> that<00:01:43.020> it<00:01:43.410> should<00:01:43.710> look

once you have done that it should look
like<00:01:44.340> this<00:01:44.670> with<00:01:45.300> this<00:01:45.780> cycle<00:01:46.260> but<00:01:46.770> you'd<00:01:46.920> have

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:47.010 
like this with this cycle but you'd have

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:49.610 
like this with this cycle but you'd have

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:49.620 
one pop show now what you do if you fold

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:52.370 
one pop show now what you do if you fold
it<00:01:49.740> and<00:01:49.800> not<00:01:50.130> one<00:01:50.580> more<00:01:50.790> test<00:01:51.000> so<00:01:51.930> you<00:01:51.990> have

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
it and not one more test so you have

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:59.300 
it and not one more test so you have
this<00:01:54.770> is<00:01:55.770> on<00:01:56.370> for<00:01:57.210> its<00:01:57.560> folded<00:01:58.560> you're<00:01:59.160> going

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
this is on for its folded you're going

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.440 
this is on for its folded you're going
to<00:01:59.370> cut<00:01:59.700> there's<00:02:00.660> a<00:02:00.750> line<00:02:01.050> right<00:02:01.290> here<00:02:02.330> for<00:02:03.330> you

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
to cut there's a line right here for you

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.260 
to cut there's a line right here for you
so<00:02:03.660> you<00:02:03.750> don't<00:02:04.610> there's<00:02:05.610> a<00:02:05.700> line<00:02:05.880> right<00:02:06.060> there

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
so you don't there's a line right there

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.919 
so you don't there's a line right there
and<00:02:06.810> you<00:02:06.930> just<00:02:06.960> cut<00:02:07.350> a<00:02:07.830> little<00:02:08.340> triangle<00:02:08.910> up<00:02:09.570> to

00:02:09.919 --> 00:02:09.929 
and you just cut a little triangle up to

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.370 
and you just cut a little triangle up to
that<00:02:10.080> lock<00:02:10.350> and<00:02:11.240> make<00:02:12.240> sure<00:02:12.270> to<00:02:12.480> pass<00:02:12.840> to<00:02:13.170> that

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
that lock and make sure to pass to that

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.730 
that lock and make sure to pass to that
line<00:02:13.590> miles<00:02:13.950> farther<00:02:14.430> or<00:02:14.940> no<00:02:15.480> shorter<00:02:15.870> and

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
line miles farther or no shorter and

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:20.020 
line miles farther or no shorter and
then<00:02:17.370> open<00:02:18.060> it<00:02:18.150> up<00:02:18.300> and<00:02:18.480> you'll<00:02:18.630> have<00:02:18.780> a

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:20.030 
then open it up and you'll have a

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:26.090 
then open it up and you'll have a
diagonal<00:02:21.030> I<00:02:21.270> mean<00:02:22.790> promise<00:02:23.790> promise<00:02:24.620> now<00:02:25.620> what

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
diagonal I mean promise promise now what

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.440 
diagonal I mean promise promise now what
you<00:02:26.250> do<00:02:26.400> is<00:02:27.290> you<00:02:28.290> fold<00:02:29.100> it<00:02:29.250> again<00:02:29.700> like<00:02:30.240> this

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
you do is you fold it again like this

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.810 
you do is you fold it again like this
and<00:02:30.840> this<00:02:31.530> is<00:02:31.590> where<00:02:31.920> the<00:02:32.130> ruler<00:02:32.340> comes<00:02:32.640> in

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
and this is where the ruler comes in

and this is where the ruler comes in
you're<00:02:33.660> going<00:02:33.780> to<00:02:33.840> measure<00:02:33.990> about<00:02:34.590> half<00:02:35.340> an

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
you're going to measure about half an

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:40.699 
you're going to measure about half an
inch<00:02:36.830> yeah<00:02:37.830> half<00:02:38.310> an<00:02:38.430> inch<00:02:38.580> on<00:02:39.320> each<00:02:40.320> of<00:02:40.620> the

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:40.709 
inch yeah half an inch on each of the

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:45.260 
inch yeah half an inch on each of the
fold<00:02:40.980> so<00:02:42.080> right<00:02:43.080> here<00:02:43.880> you're<00:02:44.880> not<00:02:45.030> where<00:02:45.239> you

this<00:03:25.370> one<00:03:25.640> can<00:03:26.240> you<00:03:26.300> fold<00:03:26.450> this<00:03:26.570> one<00:03:26.780> down<00:03:26.930> when

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 
this one can you fold this one down when

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:29.650 
this one can you fold this one down when
you<00:03:27.530> skip<00:03:27.770> back<00:03:27.950> same<00:03:28.670> with<00:03:28.820> this<00:03:28.940> side<00:03:29.000> now

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:29.660 
you skip back same with this side now

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:32.260
