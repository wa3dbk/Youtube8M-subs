took a month off hoping that it would
heal<00:00:17.789> and<00:00:19.220> that<00:00:20.220> you're<00:00:20.460> also<00:00:20.730> exercise

you're you are go to the gym six days a
week<00:00:25.380> so<00:00:25.890> my<00:00:26.550> guess<00:00:27.119> just<00:00:27.689> based<00:00:27.930> on<00:00:28.140> that

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
week so my guess just based on that

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.830 
week so my guess just based on that
history<00:00:28.500> and<00:00:28.890> based<00:00:29.099> on<00:00:29.310> the<00:00:29.550> chronic<00:00:30.510> nature

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
history and based on the chronic nature

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.910 
history and based on the chronic nature
that<00:00:31.230> this<00:00:31.410> injury<00:00:32.130> has<00:00:32.340> become<00:00:32.850> is<00:00:33.920> that

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:34.920 
that this injury has become is that

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.360 
that this injury has become is that
you're<00:00:35.250> strong<00:00:35.730> but<00:00:36.090> you<00:00:36.210> haven't<00:00:36.420> isolated

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:37.370 
you're strong but you haven't isolated

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.280 
you're strong but you haven't isolated
that<00:00:38.370> particular<00:00:39.059> muscle<00:00:39.390> in<00:00:39.840> order<00:00:40.140> to

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
that particular muscle in order to

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.619 
that particular muscle in order to
regain<00:00:40.469> strength<00:00:41.010> to<00:00:41.489> tolerate<00:00:42.000> an<00:00:42.120> activity

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
regain strength to tolerate an activity

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:53.540 
regain strength to tolerate an activity
like<00:00:42.840> soccer<00:00:51.110> soccer<00:00:52.110> is<00:00:52.379> a<00:00:52.410> lot<00:00:52.710> of<00:00:52.860> standing

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
like soccer soccer is a lot of standing

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.479

00:00:59.240 --> 00:00:59.250 
you need to start training within that

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.729 
you need to start training within that
level<00:00:59.969> of<00:01:00.440> activity<00:01:01.440> to<00:01:01.890> help<00:01:02.100> rehab<00:01:02.989> you<00:01:03.989> so

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
to ice for 15 minutes I know it's an

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.179 
to ice for 15 minutes I know it's an
awkward<00:01:12.479> place<00:01:12.780> to<00:01:12.960> ice<00:01:13.110> but<00:01:13.409> put<00:01:13.619> ice<00:01:13.830> right

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189

this<00:03:55.859> exercise<00:03:56.370> tubing<00:03:56.970> and<00:03:57.750> you're<00:03:57.900> just

00:03:58.129 --> 00:03:58.139 
this exercise tubing and you're just

00:03:58.139 --> 00:04:01.879 
this exercise tubing and you're just
gonna<00:03:58.260> isolate<00:03:59.389> the<00:04:00.389> adductors<00:04:01.170> by<00:04:01.470> standing

00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:01.889 
gonna isolate the adductors by standing

00:04:01.889 --> 00:04:06.710 
gonna isolate the adductors by standing
on<00:04:02.040> one<00:04:02.310> leg<00:04:03.319> knees<00:04:04.319> slightly<00:04:04.739> bent<00:04:05.720> you're

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
on one leg knees slightly bent you're

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:11.259 
on one leg knees slightly bent you're
just<00:04:06.930> gonna<00:04:07.079> pull<00:04:07.440> straight<00:04:08.310> across<00:04:10.069> and

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:11.269 
just gonna pull straight across and

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:13.849 
just gonna pull straight across and
you'll<00:04:12.269> think<00:04:12.599> that<00:04:12.780> you're<00:04:12.930> exercising<00:04:13.290> this

00:04:13.849 --> 00:04:13.859 
you'll think that you're exercising this

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:16.009 
you'll think that you're exercising this
leg<00:04:14.130> but<00:04:14.400> often<00:04:14.849> what<00:04:15.060> we're<00:04:15.239> really

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:16.019 
leg but often what we're really

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:19.550 
leg but often what we're really
strengthening<00:04:16.739> is<00:04:17.039> the<00:04:17.220> stabilizing<00:04:17.820> leg<00:04:18.560> so

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
strengthening is the stabilizing leg so

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.170 
strengthening is the stabilizing leg so

00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:03.430 
you there and isolating the muscles here

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:06.660 
you there and isolating the muscles here
in<00:05:03.550> the<00:05:03.700> hips<00:05:04.650> will<00:05:05.650> strengthen<00:05:06.220> them<00:05:06.430> and

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:06.670 
in the hips will strengthen them and

00:05:06.670 --> 00:05:08.850
