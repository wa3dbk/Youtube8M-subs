polyester resin 99.9 percent off but I'm
not<00:00:18.330> thinking<00:00:18.630> those<00:00:18.810> staying<00:00:19.140> in<00:00:19.320> line<00:00:19.500> fight

some<00:00:20.009> guy<00:00:20.160> over<00:00:20.189> TV<00:00:20.670> but<00:00:21.029> anyhow<00:00:21.869> the<00:00:21.930> last

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:22.200 
some guy over TV but anyhow the last

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.389 
some guy over TV but anyhow the last
couple<00:00:22.470> days<00:00:22.619> have<00:00:22.829> actually<00:00:23.160> got<00:00:23.279> a<00:00:23.310> little

00:00:23.389 --> 00:00:23.399 
couple days have actually got a little

00:00:23.399 --> 00:00:25.490 
couple days have actually got a little
bit<00:00:23.579> of<00:00:23.669> work<00:00:23.820> done<00:00:23.849> on<00:00:24.329> our<00:00:24.899> big<00:00:25.200> giant

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:25.500 
bit of work done on our big giant

bit of work done on our big giant
cardboard<00:00:25.950> boat<00:00:26.399> project<00:00:27.000> here<00:00:27.329> so<00:00:27.660> I<00:00:27.689> thought

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
cardboard boat project here so I thought

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.650 
cardboard boat project here so I thought
I'd<00:00:27.989> give<00:00:28.169> you<00:00:28.200> guys<00:00:28.410> an<00:00:28.590> update<00:00:29.119> and<00:00:30.119> no<00:00:30.480> more

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
I'd give you guys an update and no more

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.420 
I'd give you guys an update and no more
tattoos<00:00:31.140> from<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:31.500> hot<00:00:31.649> glue<00:00:31.950> gun<00:00:31.980> and<00:00:32.279> by<00:00:32.369> the

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:32.430 
tattoos from the hot glue gun and by the

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.620 
tattoos from the hot glue gun and by the
way<00:00:34.070> it's<00:00:35.070> starting<00:00:35.460> to<00:00:35.520> take<00:00:36.090> a<00:00:36.300> little<00:00:36.480> bit

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
way it's starting to take a little bit

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.120 
way it's starting to take a little bit
of<00:00:36.690> shape<00:00:36.930> here<00:00:37.170> in<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.350> corner<00:00:37.710> this<00:00:37.860> has

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:38.130 
of shape here in the corner this has

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:39.200 
of shape here in the corner this has
been<00:00:38.250> a<00:00:38.280> little<00:00:38.370> bit<00:00:38.520> tougher<00:00:38.880> than<00:00:38.970> what<00:00:39.150> I

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
been a little bit tougher than what I

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:39.740 
been a little bit tougher than what I
thought

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
thought

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.100 
thought
and<00:00:41.240> let's<00:00:42.240> get<00:00:42.390> to<00:00:42.480> thinking<00:00:42.720> about<00:00:42.750> it<00:00:43.020> I

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:43.110 
and let's get to thinking about it I

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:45.650 
and let's get to thinking about it I
realized<00:00:43.290> why<00:00:43.650> we've<00:00:44.130> got<00:00:44.340> a<00:00:44.580> radius<00:00:45.480> down

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
realized why we've got a radius down

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.350 
realized why we've got a radius down
here<00:00:45.990> there's<00:00:46.740> 34<00:00:47.340> inches<00:00:47.700> and<00:00:47.850> that<00:00:47.940> radius

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
here there's 34 inches and that radius

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.590 
here there's 34 inches and that radius
what<00:00:48.810> it<00:00:48.960> does<00:00:49.170> is<00:00:49.440> it<00:00:49.590> defines<00:00:50.270> this<00:00:51.270> point

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
what it does is it defines this point

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.730 
what it does is it defines this point
right<00:00:51.780> here<00:00:52.370> see<00:00:53.370> it<00:00:53.930> so<00:00:54.930> that's<00:00:55.110> constant

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:55.740 
right here see it so that's constant

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:58.100 
right here see it so that's constant
height<00:00:55.950> in<00:00:56.460> point<00:00:56.760> relative<00:00:57.480> to<00:00:57.630> the<00:00:57.720> deck<00:00:57.900> all

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:58.110 
height in point relative to the deck all

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:00.710 
height in point relative to the deck all
the<00:00:58.140> way<00:00:58.320> around<00:00:58.650> so<00:00:58.829> that's<00:00:59.460> one<00:00:59.700> radius<00:01:00.150> the

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:00.720 
the way around so that's one radius the

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:02.540 
the way around so that's one radius the
second<00:01:01.170> radius<00:01:01.530> is<00:01:01.680> this<00:01:01.829> one<00:01:01.980> up<00:01:02.100> here<00:01:02.370> which

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
second radius is this one up here which

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.109 
second radius is this one up here which
is<00:01:02.579> 36<00:01:03.450> inch<00:01:03.690> radius<00:01:04.189> and<00:01:05.189> that<00:01:05.339> has<00:01:05.579> that's

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
is 36 inch radius and that has that's

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:08.120 
is 36 inch radius and that has that's
basically<00:01:06.600> derived<00:01:06.960> off<00:01:07.290> how<00:01:07.590> I<00:01:07.619> laid<00:01:07.920> out<00:01:07.950> the

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
basically derived off how I laid out the

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:10.790 
basically derived off how I laid out the
seating<00:01:09.000> and<00:01:09.420> kind<00:01:09.899> of<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.020> curved<00:01:10.229> banquette

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:10.800 
seating and kind of the curved banquette

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:14.390 
seating and kind of the curved banquette
up<00:01:11.010> here<00:01:12.320> both<00:01:13.320> these<00:01:13.560> have<00:01:13.740> different<00:01:13.770> center

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
up here both these have different center

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.000 
up here both these have different center
points<00:01:14.760> so<00:01:14.970> what<00:01:15.240> that<00:01:15.390> means<00:01:15.690> is<00:01:16.170> this<00:01:16.710> one

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:17.010 
points so what that means is this one

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:18.890 
points so what that means is this one
the<00:01:17.250> upper<00:01:17.580> one<00:01:17.729> starts<00:01:18.090> curving<00:01:18.390> at<00:01:18.720> this

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
the upper one starts curving at this

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.760 
the upper one starts curving at this
point<00:01:19.170> here<00:01:19.409> and<00:01:19.830> wraps<00:01:20.159> around<00:01:21.440> however<00:01:22.440> if

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
point here and wraps around however if

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.950 
point here and wraps around however if
you<00:01:22.860> go<00:01:22.979> straight<00:01:23.220> down<00:01:23.479> this<00:01:24.479> one<00:01:24.690> here

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
you go straight down this one here

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:26.600 
you go straight down this one here
doesn't<00:01:25.229> actually<00:01:25.500> start<00:01:25.890> curving<00:01:26.159> till<00:01:26.549> you

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
doesn't actually start curving till you

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.680 
doesn't actually start curving till you
get<00:01:26.760> right<00:01:26.940> here<00:01:27.000> so<00:01:28.970> if<00:01:29.970> you<00:01:30.120> guys<00:01:30.270> can<00:01:30.479> see

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:30.690 
get right here so if you guys can see

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:33.710 
get right here so if you guys can see
this<00:01:30.960> from<00:01:31.260> here<00:01:31.590> to<00:01:31.770> here<00:01:32.700> is<00:01:33.180> actually

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
this from here to here is actually

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.590 
this from here to here is actually
straight<00:01:34.110> when<00:01:34.830> the<00:01:34.950> upper<00:01:35.190> one's<00:01:35.369> curving<00:01:35.850> so

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
straight when the upper one's curving so

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.050 
straight when the upper one's curving so
after<00:01:37.380> pondering<00:01:37.860> it<00:01:37.950> for<00:01:38.130> a<00:01:38.159> while<00:01:38.310> I<00:01:38.340> figured

00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:39.060 
after pondering it for a while I figured

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:40.969 
after pondering it for a while I figured
out<00:01:39.180> the<00:01:39.540> way<00:01:39.570> to<00:01:39.750> approach<00:01:40.080> this<00:01:40.409> as<00:01:40.650> I<00:01:40.770> made

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
out the way to approach this as I made

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.210 
out the way to approach this as I made
this<00:01:41.460> little<00:01:41.760> dirt<00:01:42.000> right<00:01:42.330> here<00:01:42.360> this<00:01:42.780> rib<00:01:43.260> and

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
this little dirt right here this rib and

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:48.500 
this little dirt right here this rib and
what<00:01:44.640> this<00:01:44.760> rib<00:01:45.000> is<00:01:45.030> if<00:01:45.990> you<00:01:46.610> project<00:01:47.610> this

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:48.510 
what this rib is if you project this

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:50.600 
what this rib is if you project this
line<00:01:48.780> straight<00:01:49.200> out<00:01:49.439> and<00:01:49.770> the<00:01:49.890> another<00:01:50.280> line

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
line straight out and the another line

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.450 
line straight out and the another line
straight<00:01:51.060> out<00:01:51.270> 34<00:01:52.020> inches<00:01:52.439> that's<00:01:53.159> where<00:01:53.400> the

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
straight out 34 inches that's where the

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.210 
straight out 34 inches that's where the
center<00:01:53.729> point<00:01:53.939> forms<00:01:54.390> so<00:01:54.630> from<00:01:55.170> here<00:01:55.530> around

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:56.220 
center point forms so from here around

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.230 
center point forms so from here around
to<00:01:56.490> here<00:01:56.880> is<00:01:57.689> 90<00:01:58.140> degrees<00:01:58.850> so<00:01:59.850> I<00:01:59.909> built<00:02:00.119> this

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
to here is 90 degrees so I built this

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.820 
to here is 90 degrees so I built this
rib<00:02:00.570> and<00:02:01.610> I<00:02:02.610> knew<00:02:03.030> that<00:02:03.360> this<00:02:03.960> point<00:02:04.259> here<00:02:04.500> was

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:04.830 
rib and I knew that this point here was

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.399 
rib and I knew that this point here was
two<00:02:05.759> inches<00:02:06.090> over<00:02:06.540> from<00:02:06.689> the<00:02:06.810> deck<00:02:06.990> and<00:02:07.259> two

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
two inches over from the deck and two

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.160 
two inches over from the deck and two
inches<00:02:07.650> up<00:02:07.890> from<00:02:08.159> the<00:02:08.250> deck<00:02:08.539> so<00:02:09.539> I<00:02:09.840> measured

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
inches up from the deck so I measured

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.309 
inches up from the deck so I measured
this<00:02:10.349> length<00:02:10.619> over<00:02:10.950> to<00:02:11.989> probably<00:02:12.989> can't<00:02:13.170> see

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
this length over to probably can't see

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:14.839 
this length over to probably can't see
it<00:02:13.409> in<00:02:13.500> there<00:02:13.620> the<00:02:13.769> curved<00:02:14.010> wall<00:02:14.280> pieces<00:02:14.579> I

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:14.849 
it in there the curved wall pieces I

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:17.289 
it in there the curved wall pieces I
made<00:02:15.060> and<00:02:15.389> then<00:02:16.169> measured<00:02:17.099> the<00:02:17.219> height

00:02:17.289 --> 00:02:17.299 
made and then measured the height

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:19.940 
made and then measured the height
measured<00:02:18.299> the<00:02:18.900> length<00:02:19.139> from<00:02:19.349> the<00:02:19.439> curved<00:02:19.680> wall

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
measured the length from the curved wall

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:21.920 
measured the length from the curved wall
peace-out<00:02:20.400> to<00:02:20.640> here<00:02:20.879> found<00:02:21.239> this<00:02:21.360> point<00:02:21.690> that

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:21.930 
peace-out to here found this point that

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.949 
peace-out to here found this point that
that<00:02:22.050> piece<00:02:22.290> out<00:02:22.500> and<00:02:22.770> once<00:02:23.760> I<00:02:23.879> did<00:02:24.060> that<00:02:24.090> these

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
that piece out and once I did that these

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:27.920 
that piece out and once I did that these
pieces<00:02:25.489> in<00:02:26.489> between<00:02:26.700> what<00:02:27.360> I<00:02:27.390> did<00:02:27.660> was<00:02:27.840> I

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
pieces in between what I did was I

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.780 
pieces in between what I did was I
measured<00:02:28.290> this<00:02:28.379> curve<00:02:28.680> up<00:02:28.920> here<00:02:28.950> along<00:02:29.489> the

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
measured this curve up here along the

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:32.259 
measured this curve up here along the
curve<00:02:30.030> are<00:02:30.300> using<00:02:30.569> 158<00:02:31.200> measure<00:02:31.440> for<00:02:31.709> this<00:02:31.830> and

00:02:32.259 --> 00:02:32.269 
curve are using 158 measure for this and

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:36.140 
curve are using 158 measure for this and
divided<00:02:33.269> that<00:02:33.540> into<00:02:33.900> three<00:02:34.200> equal<00:02:34.470> links<00:02:35.370> and

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
divided that into three equal links and

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.089 
divided that into three equal links and
I<00:02:36.269> did<00:02:36.450> the<00:02:36.540> same<00:02:36.720> thing<00:02:36.989> down<00:02:37.200> here<00:02:37.620> although

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:38.099 
I did the same thing down here although

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:39.500 
I did the same thing down here although
I<00:02:38.250> could<00:02:38.489> use<00:02:38.610> a<00:02:38.640> straight<00:02:38.970> tape<00:02:39.269> measure

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
I could use a straight tape measure

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.390 
I could use a straight tape measure
since<00:02:39.840> this<00:02:39.989> is<00:02:40.170> a<00:02:40.200> straight<00:02:40.590> segment<00:02:41.280> this

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
since this is a straight segment this

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.190 
since this is a straight segment this
looks<00:02:41.819> a<00:02:41.910> little<00:02:42.030> bit<00:02:42.239> curved<00:02:42.540> I<00:02:42.750> got<00:02:42.930> one<00:02:43.080> of

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:43.200 
looks a little bit curved I got one of

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.670 
looks a little bit curved I got one of
these<00:02:43.290> ribs<00:02:43.650> too<00:02:43.860> tall<00:02:44.069> this<00:02:44.280> one<00:02:44.489> here<00:02:45.680> anyhow

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
these ribs too tall this one here anyhow

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.170 
these ribs too tall this one here anyhow
and<00:02:46.769> divided<00:02:47.130> that<00:02:47.250> up<00:02:47.459> and<00:02:47.760> repeated<00:02:48.150> the

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
and divided that up and repeated the

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.699 
and divided that up and repeated the
process<00:02:48.450> and<00:02:49.019> made<00:02:49.200> these<00:02:50.040> ribs<00:02:50.340> here<00:02:51.709> you'll

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709 
process and made these ribs here you'll

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:54.320 
process and made these ribs here you'll
notice<00:02:53.010> these<00:02:53.160> little<00:02:53.220> pieces<00:02:53.610> in<00:02:53.910> here<00:02:54.090> the

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
notice these little pieces in here the

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.570 
notice these little pieces in here the
only<00:02:54.360> thing<00:02:54.540> those<00:02:54.900> were<00:02:55.080> on<00:02:55.290> there<00:02:55.560> for<00:02:55.860> was

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
only thing those were on there for was

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:57.979 
only thing those were on there for was
the<00:02:56.730> stiff<00:02:56.970> in<00:02:57.090> this<00:02:57.209> river<00:02:57.480> because<00:02:57.959> the

00:02:57.979 --> 00:02:57.989 
the stiff in this river because the

00:02:57.989 --> 00:02:59.900 
the stiff in this river because the
cardboard<00:02:58.560> has<00:02:58.709> a<00:02:58.739> tendency<00:02:59.250> to<00:02:59.340> try<00:02:59.489> to<00:02:59.549> curve

00:02:59.900 --> 00:02:59.910 
cardboard has a tendency to try to curve

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:03.380 
cardboard has a tendency to try to curve
I<00:03:00.840> think<00:03:01.709> it's<00:03:01.829> from<00:03:01.980> differences<00:03:02.819> different

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
I think it's from differences different

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:05.180 
I think it's from differences different
moisture<00:03:03.810> content<00:03:04.290> the<00:03:04.349> different<00:03:04.680> faces<00:03:05.069> or

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:05.190 
moisture content the different faces or

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:07.130 
moisture content the different faces or
whatever<00:03:05.549> but<00:03:05.760> anyhow<00:03:06.480> that<00:03:06.510> was<00:03:06.690> basically

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:07.140 
whatever but anyhow that was basically

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:08.660 
whatever but anyhow that was basically
to<00:03:07.349> hold<00:03:07.530> it<00:03:07.650> straight<00:03:07.950> until<00:03:08.250> I<00:03:08.280> started

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
to hold it straight until I started

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:13.280 
to hold it straight until I started
doing<00:03:09.450> the<00:03:09.540> planking<00:03:09.959> on<00:03:10.430> so<00:03:11.930> that<00:03:12.930> solved

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:13.290 
doing the planking on so that solved

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:15.650 
doing the planking on so that solved
that<00:03:13.440> part<00:03:13.769> and<00:03:14.130> then<00:03:14.640> I<00:03:14.730> got<00:03:14.880> back<00:03:15.030> to<00:03:15.299> well

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
that part and then I got back to well

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.930 
that part and then I got back to well
how<00:03:15.780> do<00:03:15.840> I<00:03:15.930> handle<00:03:16.140> the<00:03:16.500> 90-degree<00:03:17.430> section<00:03:17.849> of

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940 
how do I handle the 90-degree section of

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.750 
how do I handle the 90-degree section of
this<00:03:18.030> bottom<00:03:18.390> radius<00:03:18.829> and<00:03:19.829> this<00:03:20.489> would<00:03:20.670> have

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
this bottom radius and this would have

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.280 
this bottom radius and this would have
been<00:03:20.849> easier<00:03:21.180> if<00:03:21.209> I'd<00:03:21.390> thought<00:03:21.630> through<00:03:22.140> it

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
been easier if I'd thought through it

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:24.199 
been easier if I'd thought through it
and<00:03:22.590> laid<00:03:22.829> everything<00:03:23.280> out<00:03:23.549> on<00:03:23.730> this<00:03:23.849> piece<00:03:24.060> of

00:03:24.199 --> 00:03:24.209 
and laid everything out on this piece of

00:03:24.209 --> 00:03:26.330 
and laid everything out on this piece of
cardboard<00:03:24.480> down<00:03:24.780> here<00:03:25.079> however<00:03:25.319> I<00:03:25.920> counted

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
cardboard down here however I counted

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.750 
cardboard down here however I counted
this<00:03:26.489> by<00:03:26.700> the<00:03:26.760> seat<00:03:27.180> of<00:03:27.239> my<00:03:27.269> pants<00:03:27.600> so<00:03:27.780> I<00:03:27.840> didn't

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
this by the seat of my pants so I didn't

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.140 
this by the seat of my pants so I didn't
this<00:03:29.760> rib<00:03:30.060> right<00:03:30.269> here<00:03:30.690> is<00:03:31.260> actually<00:03:32.150> 45

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
this rib right here is actually 45

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.599 
this rib right here is actually 45
degrees<00:03:33.660> from<00:03:34.290> this<00:03:34.500> rib<00:03:34.769> over<00:03:34.920> here<00:03:35.250> for<00:03:35.549> this

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:35.609 
degrees from this rib over here for this

00:03:35.609 --> 00:03:37.220 
degrees from this rib over here for this
piece<00:03:35.819> of<00:03:35.850> tape<00:03:36.180> here<00:03:36.209> for<00:03:36.630> reference<00:03:36.840> there's

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:37.230 
piece of tape here for reference there's

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:38.360 
piece of tape here for reference there's
so<00:03:37.319> many<00:03:37.380> ribs<00:03:37.739> here<00:03:37.980> it<00:03:38.040> gets<00:03:38.100> kind<00:03:38.340> of

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.370 
so many ribs here it gets kind of

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.780 
so many ribs here it gets kind of
confusing<00:03:38.489> but<00:03:39.480> it's<00:03:39.660> 45<00:03:40.049> degrees<00:03:40.440> over<00:03:40.829> to

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:41.790 
confusing but it's 45 degrees over to

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:44.509 
confusing but it's 45 degrees over to
here<00:03:42.150> and<00:03:42.299> from<00:03:42.780> here<00:03:42.840> over<00:03:43.650> to<00:03:43.889> here<00:03:44.010> is

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 
here and from here over to here is

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:46.309 
here and from here over to here is
another<00:03:44.850> 45<00:03:45.329> degree<00:03:45.630> so<00:03:45.750> we've<00:03:45.840> got<00:03:45.989> ninety

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:46.319 
another 45 degree so we've got ninety

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:49.580 
another 45 degree so we've got ninety
degree<00:03:46.590> angle<00:03:47.750> but<00:03:48.750> I<00:03:48.870> didn't<00:03:49.139> know<00:03:49.260> I

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
degree angle but I didn't know I

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:51.710 
degree angle but I didn't know I
couldn't<00:03:50.370> physically<00:03:50.850> get<00:03:51.120> to<00:03:51.239> my<00:03:51.359> center

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:51.720 
couldn't physically get to my center

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:54.229 
couldn't physically get to my center
point<00:03:51.900> to<00:03:52.049> lay<00:03:52.260> this<00:03:52.500> line<00:03:52.769> out<00:03:53.090> because<00:03:54.090> I'd

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
point to lay this line out because I'd

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:57.140 
point to lay this line out because I'd
glued<00:03:54.540> this<00:03:54.720> curve<00:03:55.079> wolfies<00:03:55.650> in<00:03:55.829> place<00:03:56.150> so

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:57.150 
glued this curve wolfies in place so

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:58.819 
glued this curve wolfies in place so
what<00:03:57.329> I<00:03:57.359> did<00:03:57.600> was<00:03:57.750> I<00:03:57.870> measured<00:03:58.170> from<00:03:58.290> a<00:03:58.380> corner

00:03:58.819 --> 00:03:58.829 
what I did was I measured from a corner

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:03.559 
what I did was I measured from a corner
a<00:03:59.750> certain<00:04:00.750> distance<00:04:01.200> on<00:04:01.380> both<00:04:01.410> sides<00:04:02.450> and<00:04:03.450> it

00:04:03.559 --> 00:04:03.569 
a certain distance on both sides and it

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:05.360 
a certain distance on both sides and it
doesn't<00:04:03.870> matter<00:04:04.019> what<00:04:04.349> that<00:04:04.410> distance<00:04:04.980> is<00:04:05.220> I

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
doesn't matter what that distance is I

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.670 
doesn't matter what that distance is I
projected<00:04:06.299> those<00:04:06.450> lines<00:04:06.720> out<00:04:06.930> at<00:04:07.109> 90<00:04:07.380> degree

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:07.680 
projected those lines out at 90 degree

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.849 
projected those lines out at 90 degree
angles<00:04:08.099> and<00:04:08.250> wherever<00:04:08.430> they<00:04:08.639> intersect

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:09.859 
angles and wherever they intersect

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:12.470 
angles and wherever they intersect
that's<00:04:10.859> a<00:04:11.010> point<00:04:11.250> along<00:04:11.579> this<00:04:11.819> line<00:04:12.090> that<00:04:12.329> goes

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480 
that's a point along this line that goes

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.150 
that's a point along this line that goes
from<00:04:12.540> the<00:04:12.900> corner<00:04:13.290> to<00:04:13.319> the<00:04:13.530> center<00:04:13.560> because

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:14.160 
from the corner to the center because

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.539 
from the corner to the center because
it's<00:04:14.370> a<00:04:14.900> 45-degree<00:04:15.900> angle<00:04:15.930> so<00:04:16.859> I<00:04:16.919> found<00:04:17.130> that<00:04:17.310> a

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:17.549 
it's a 45-degree angle so I found that a

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:21.469 
it's a 45-degree angle so I found that a
tenth<00:04:17.970> point<00:04:18.120> made<00:04:18.780> this<00:04:19.049> rib<00:04:20.090> again<00:04:21.090> this

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:21.479 
tenth point made this rib again this

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:25.520 
tenth point made this rib again this
curved<00:04:21.780> piece<00:04:22.019> here<00:04:22.440> is<00:04:22.669> the<00:04:23.750> point<00:04:24.750> where<00:04:25.440> the

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:25.530 
curved piece here is the point where the

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:27.920 
curved piece here is the point where the
two<00:04:25.710> planes<00:04:26.039> the<00:04:26.550> horrors<00:04:26.880> of<00:04:26.970> the<00:04:27.240> one<00:04:27.780> that's

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:27.930 
two planes the horrors of the one that's

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:29.719 
two planes the horrors of the one that's
sloping<00:04:28.229> outward<00:04:28.590> and<00:04:29.190> the<00:04:29.310> one<00:04:29.430> that<00:04:29.490> slopes

00:04:29.719 --> 00:04:29.729 
sloping outward and the one that slopes

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:31.909 
sloping outward and the one that slopes
inward<00:04:30.150> come<00:04:30.330> together<00:04:30.530> if<00:04:31.530> this<00:04:31.740> was<00:04:31.890> the

00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:31.919 
inward come together if this was the

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:33.290 
inward come together if this was the
actual<00:04:32.159> boat<00:04:32.640> you<00:04:32.940> wouldn't

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:33.300 
actual boat you wouldn't

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.210 
actual boat you wouldn't
this<00:04:33.509> vertical<00:04:33.990> surface<00:04:34.409> or<00:04:34.590> be<00:04:34.740> actually<00:04:35.129> at

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:35.220 
this vertical surface or be actually at

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:36.800 
this vertical surface or be actually at
this<00:04:35.550> point<00:04:35.849> here<00:04:36.180> there<00:04:36.389> would<00:04:36.509> actually<00:04:36.629> be

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:36.810 
this point here there would actually be

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:40.700 
this point here there would actually be
a<00:04:36.900> plane<00:04:37.560> that<00:04:37.800> slopes<00:04:38.099> back<00:04:39.110> this<00:04:40.110> plane<00:04:40.379> here

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:40.710 
a plane that slopes back this plane here

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:44.089 
a plane that slopes back this plane here
so<00:04:41.699> but<00:04:42.569> any<00:04:42.840> others<00:04:43.110> without<00:04:43.560> cutting<00:04:43.919> the

00:04:44.089 --> 00:04:44.099 
so but any others without cutting the

00:04:44.099 --> 00:04:45.290 
so but any others without cutting the
plywood<00:04:44.520> off<00:04:44.639> it<00:04:44.759> couldn't<00:04:44.970> do<00:04:45.060> that<00:04:45.210> in

00:04:45.290 --> 00:04:45.300 
plywood off it couldn't do that in

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.899 
plywood off it couldn't do that in
mock-up<00:04:45.720> but<00:04:45.900> I<00:04:46.080> got<00:04:46.830> this<00:04:46.979> rib<00:04:47.250> established

00:04:47.899 --> 00:04:47.909 
mock-up but I got this rib established

00:04:47.909 --> 00:04:49.369 
mock-up but I got this rib established
and<00:04:48.150> then<00:04:48.270> basically<00:04:48.659> I<00:04:48.810> repeated<00:04:49.289> the

00:04:49.369 --> 00:04:49.379 
and then basically I repeated the

00:04:49.379 --> 00:04:53.089 
and then basically I repeated the
process<00:04:50.659> for<00:04:51.659> the<00:04:51.750> ribs<00:04:51.930> in<00:04:52.139> between<00:04:52.530> just

00:04:53.089 --> 00:04:53.099 
process for the ribs in between just

00:04:53.099 --> 00:04:55.040 
process for the ribs in between just
like<00:04:53.250> it<00:04:53.370> did<00:04:53.520> these<00:04:53.669> other<00:04:54.030> ribs<00:04:54.330> down<00:04:54.539> here<00:04:54.870> I

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:55.050 
like it did these other ribs down here I

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:57.499 
like it did these other ribs down here I
measured<00:04:55.860> the<00:04:55.979> circumference<00:04:56.550> divided<00:04:57.180> it

00:04:57.499 --> 00:04:57.509 
measured the circumference divided it

00:04:57.509 --> 00:05:00.200 
measured the circumference divided it
into<00:04:57.720> three<00:04:57.840> part<00:04:58.400> did<00:04:59.400> the<00:04:59.520> same<00:04:59.729> thing<00:04:59.970> down

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:00.210 
into three part did the same thing down

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:03.020 
into three part did the same thing down
here<00:05:00.629> these<00:05:01.050> are<00:05:01.289> obviously<00:05:02.039> wider<00:05:02.340> spacing

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:03.030 
here these are obviously wider spacing

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:05.839 
here these are obviously wider spacing
down<00:05:03.870> here<00:05:04.050> in<00:05:04.139> the<00:05:04.199> bottom<00:05:04.550> and<00:05:05.550> they've<00:05:05.699> got

00:05:05.839 --> 00:05:05.849 
down here in the bottom and they've got

00:05:05.849 --> 00:05:07.659 
down here in the bottom and they've got
these<00:05:06.000> pieces<00:05:06.270> and<00:05:06.719> then<00:05:06.930> once<00:05:07.110> I<00:05:07.199> had<00:05:07.379> that

00:05:07.659 --> 00:05:07.669 
these pieces and then once I had that

00:05:07.669 --> 00:05:09.800 
these pieces and then once I had that
I've<00:05:08.669> got<00:05:08.819> kind<00:05:08.940> of<00:05:09.030> my<00:05:09.150> framework<00:05:09.659> and<00:05:09.780> I

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:09.810 
I've got kind of my framework and I

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:11.930 
I've got kind of my framework and I
think<00:05:10.020> GT<00:05:10.770> 1<00:05:11.129> million<00:05:11.520> I<00:05:11.610> think<00:05:11.639> you'd

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:11.940 
think GT 1 million I think you'd

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:13.909 
think GT 1 million I think you'd
mentioned<00:05:12.360> in<00:05:12.509> like<00:05:12.719> a<00:05:12.750> basket<00:05:13.440> weave<00:05:13.469> sort<00:05:13.830> of

00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:13.919 
mentioned in like a basket weave sort of

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:15.409 
mentioned in like a basket weave sort of
deal<00:05:14.009> this<00:05:14.219> is<00:05:14.280> real<00:05:14.580> similar<00:05:14.849> I<00:05:15.000> think<00:05:15.330> to

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:15.419 
deal this is real similar I think to

00:05:15.419 --> 00:05:17.240 
deal this is real similar I think to
what<00:05:15.569> you're<00:05:15.750> talking<00:05:16.080> about<00:05:16.199> I<00:05:16.469> think<00:05:16.889> your

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:17.250 
what you're talking about I think your

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:18.860 
what you're talking about I think your
basket<00:05:17.699> weave<00:05:17.879> you<00:05:18.419> actually<00:05:18.719> have<00:05:18.810> the

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:18.870 
basket weave you actually have the

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:21.290 
basket weave you actually have the
strip's<00:05:19.169> that<00:05:19.349> kind<00:05:19.560> of<00:05:19.620> go<00:05:19.940> you'd<00:05:20.940> have<00:05:21.150> one

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:21.300 
strip's that kind of go you'd have one

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:22.820 
strip's that kind of go you'd have one
that<00:05:21.449> goes<00:05:21.539> underneath<00:05:21.900> this<00:05:22.199> and<00:05:22.500> then<00:05:22.590> pokes

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:22.830 
that goes underneath this and then pokes

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:26.629 
that goes underneath this and then pokes
up<00:05:23.069> and<00:05:23.280> it<00:05:23.370> goes<00:05:23.460> over<00:05:23.729> another<00:05:23.940> rib<00:05:25.039> and<00:05:26.039> I

00:05:26.629 --> 00:05:26.639 
up and it goes over another rib and I

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:28.070 
up and it goes over another rib and I
never<00:05:27.000> have<00:05:27.150> actually<00:05:27.360> done<00:05:27.659> that<00:05:27.810> I've<00:05:27.990> done

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:28.080 
never have actually done that I've done

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:31.159 
never have actually done that I've done
this<00:05:28.259> a<00:05:28.319> lot<00:05:28.560> in<00:05:28.770> architecture<00:05:29.370> school<00:05:30.169> you

00:05:31.159 --> 00:05:31.169 
this a lot in architecture school you

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:33.320 
this a lot in architecture school you
would<00:05:31.289> not<00:05:31.469> believe<00:05:31.650> how<00:05:31.800> many<00:05:32.039> zillion<00:05:32.879> hours

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:33.330 
would not believe how many zillion hours

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:35.959 
would not believe how many zillion hours
I<00:05:33.479> have<00:05:33.629> building<00:05:34.110> stuff<00:05:34.379> like<00:05:34.620> this<00:05:34.800> but<00:05:35.099> at

00:05:35.959 --> 00:05:35.969 
I have building stuff like this but at

00:05:35.969 --> 00:05:38.029 
I have building stuff like this but at
any<00:05:36.120> rate<00:05:36.240> started<00:05:37.229> in<00:05:37.349> here<00:05:37.529> at<00:05:37.590> the<00:05:37.680> bottom

00:05:38.029 --> 00:05:38.039 
any rate started in here at the bottom

00:05:38.039 --> 00:05:40.670 
any rate started in here at the bottom
and<00:05:38.550> to<00:05:38.639> put<00:05:38.759> this<00:05:38.880> point<00:05:39.180> on<00:05:39.389> and<00:05:40.139> because<00:05:40.650> of

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:40.680 
and to put this point on and because of

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:43.189 
and to put this point on and because of
this<00:05:40.860> compound<00:05:41.340> curve<00:05:41.580> you'll<00:05:42.569> notice<00:05:42.960> that

00:05:43.189 --> 00:05:43.199 
this compound curve you'll notice that

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:45.860 
this compound curve you'll notice that
once<00:05:44.009> I<00:05:44.130> got<00:05:44.279> to<00:05:44.520> this<00:05:44.669> point<00:05:44.909> here<00:05:45.270> which<00:05:45.719> is

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:45.870 
once I got to this point here which is

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:47.269 
once I got to this point here which is
the<00:05:46.050> last<00:05:46.289> of<00:05:46.440> the<00:05:46.529> straight<00:05:46.770> segments

00:05:47.269 --> 00:05:47.279 
the last of the straight segments

00:05:47.279 --> 00:05:49.279 
the last of the straight segments
actually<00:05:47.880> had<00:05:48.180> to<00:05:48.270> start<00:05:48.509> heading<00:05:48.840> the<00:05:48.930> bottom

00:05:49.279 --> 00:05:49.289 
actually had to start heading the bottom

00:05:49.289 --> 00:05:51.080 
actually had to start heading the bottom
of<00:05:49.409> this<00:05:49.500> off<00:05:49.710> and<00:05:50.400> that's<00:05:50.610> because<00:05:50.880> of<00:05:51.000> the

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:51.090 
of this off and that's because of the

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:54.350 
of this off and that's because of the
two<00:05:51.240> radius<00:05:51.659> isn't<00:05:51.870> the<00:05:51.990> compound<00:05:52.440> curve<00:05:53.360> and

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:54.360 
two radius isn't the compound curve and

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:55.879 
two radius isn't the compound curve and
what<00:05:54.569> a<00:05:54.599> hundred<00:05:54.900> percent<00:05:55.319> sure<00:05:55.349> how<00:05:55.650> this<00:05:55.770> was

00:05:55.879 --> 00:05:55.889 
what a hundred percent sure how this was

00:05:55.889 --> 00:05:57.409 
what a hundred percent sure how this was
going<00:05:56.039> to<00:05:56.099> work<00:05:56.159> out<00:05:56.460> so<00:05:56.699> what<00:05:56.849> I<00:05:56.880> did<00:05:57.029> was<00:05:57.300> I

00:05:57.409 --> 00:05:57.419 
going to work out so what I did was I

00:05:57.419 --> 00:05:58.670 
going to work out so what I did was I
kind<00:05:57.630> of<00:05:57.690> skipped<00:05:57.960> plankton<00:05:58.380> to<00:05:58.440> put<00:05:58.560> this

00:05:58.670 --> 00:05:58.680 
kind of skipped plankton to put this

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:01.010 
kind of skipped plankton to put this
plank<00:05:58.979> on<00:05:59.190> then<00:05:59.490> I<00:05:59.520> put<00:05:59.669> another<00:05:59.699> one<00:06:00.120> on<00:06:00.150> and<00:06:00.960> I

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:01.020 
plank on then I put another one on and I

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:03.469 
plank on then I put another one on and I
put<00:06:01.199> this<00:06:01.349> one<00:06:01.560> on<00:06:01.680> it<00:06:01.949> but<00:06:02.069> this<00:06:02.190> one<00:06:02.430> on<00:06:02.580> this

00:06:03.469 --> 00:06:03.479 
put this one on it but this one on this

00:06:03.479 --> 00:06:04.700 
put this one on it but this one on this
one<00:06:03.659> and<00:06:03.779> this<00:06:03.900> one<00:06:03.960> and<00:06:04.139> I<00:06:04.289> tried<00:06:04.469> to<00:06:04.560> leave

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:04.710 
one and this one and I tried to leave

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:06.080 
one and this one and I tried to leave
two<00:06:04.919> inches<00:06:05.190> in<00:06:05.370> between<00:06:05.460> them<00:06:05.879> and<00:06:06.000> that's

00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:06.090 
two inches in between them and that's

00:06:06.090 --> 00:06:07.659 
two inches in between them and that's
what<00:06:06.389> these<00:06:06.539> planks<00:06:06.840> are<00:06:07.050> two<00:06:07.289> inches<00:06:07.529> wide

00:06:07.659 --> 00:06:07.669 
what these planks are two inches wide

00:06:07.669 --> 00:06:10.309 
what these planks are two inches wide
and<00:06:08.669> I<00:06:08.849> did<00:06:09.000> a<00:06:09.029> real<00:06:09.210> good<00:06:09.240> job<00:06:09.509> along<00:06:09.779> here<00:06:10.169> but

00:06:10.309 --> 00:06:10.319 
and I did a real good job along here but

00:06:10.319 --> 00:06:12.740 
and I did a real good job along here but
you<00:06:10.440> can<00:06:10.590> see<00:06:10.860> once<00:06:11.729> I<00:06:11.819> got<00:06:11.940> down<00:06:12.120> here<00:06:12.150> I<00:06:12.479> let

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:12.750 
you can see once I got down here I let

00:06:12.750 --> 00:06:14.749 
you can see once I got down here I let
the<00:06:12.840> gap<00:06:13.050> widen<00:06:13.889> a<00:06:13.949> little<00:06:14.099> bit<00:06:14.219> on<00:06:14.340> me<00:06:14.550> a

00:06:14.749 --> 00:06:14.759 
the gap widen a little bit on me a

00:06:14.759 --> 00:06:16.969 
the gap widen a little bit on me a
little<00:06:15.539> bit<00:06:15.659> more<00:06:15.870> so<00:06:16.139> right<00:06:16.349> here<00:06:16.620> and<00:06:16.830> I<00:06:16.860> have

00:06:16.969 --> 00:06:16.979 
little bit more so right here and I have

00:06:16.979 --> 00:06:18.860 
little bit more so right here and I have
to<00:06:17.039> cut<00:06:17.190> this<00:06:17.340> with<00:06:17.490> a<00:06:17.610> wedge<00:06:18.060> shape<00:06:18.090> to<00:06:18.599> fill

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:18.870 
to cut this with a wedge shape to fill

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:21.019 
to cut this with a wedge shape to fill
it<00:06:18.990> in<00:06:19.080> but<00:06:19.400> that's<00:06:20.400> kind<00:06:20.639> of<00:06:20.669> where<00:06:20.789> we're<00:06:20.969> at

00:06:21.019 --> 00:06:21.029 
it in but that's kind of where we're at

00:06:21.029 --> 00:06:22.490 
it in but that's kind of where we're at
and<00:06:21.419> I<00:06:21.629> need<00:06:21.779> to<00:06:21.840> fill<00:06:21.990> in<00:06:22.110> the<00:06:22.199> rest<00:06:22.349> these

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:22.500 
and I need to fill in the rest these

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:26.300 
and I need to fill in the rest these
wedges<00:06:22.770> and<00:06:24.440> actually<00:06:25.440> starts<00:06:25.680> more<00:06:25.889> planking

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:26.310 
wedges and actually starts more planking

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:29.689 
wedges and actually starts more planking
come<00:06:26.520> this<00:06:26.729> way<00:06:27.620> the<00:06:28.620> reason<00:06:28.889> I<00:06:29.310> wish<00:06:29.520> these

00:06:29.689 --> 00:06:29.699 
come this way the reason I wish these

00:06:29.699 --> 00:06:31.939 
come this way the reason I wish these
planks<00:06:30.029> were<00:06:30.270> longer<00:06:30.690> but<00:06:31.050> I<00:06:31.139> wanted<00:06:31.529> the<00:06:31.740> rib

00:06:31.939 --> 00:06:31.949 
planks were longer but I wanted the rib

00:06:31.949 --> 00:06:35.149 
planks were longer but I wanted the rib
of<00:06:32.099> the<00:06:32.159> cardboard<00:06:32.460> running<00:06:33.000> this<00:06:33.150> way<00:06:34.039> if<00:06:35.039> you

00:06:35.149 --> 00:06:35.159 
of the cardboard running this way if you

00:06:35.159 --> 00:06:36.740 
of the cardboard running this way if you
try<00:06:35.279> to<00:06:35.370> run<00:06:35.580> it<00:06:35.669> the<00:06:35.729> other<00:06:35.969> way<00:06:36.210> where<00:06:36.629> the

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:36.750 
try to run it the other way where the

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:38.600 
try to run it the other way where the
look<00:06:37.169> you<00:06:37.259> guys<00:06:37.379> can<00:06:37.560> see<00:06:37.830> the<00:06:37.979> corrugations

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:38.610 
look you guys can see the corrugations

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:41.600 
look you guys can see the corrugations
here<00:06:39.650> what<00:06:40.650> happens<00:06:41.099> is<00:06:41.279> when<00:06:41.490> you<00:06:41.580> start

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:41.610 
here what happens is when you start

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:43.610 
here what happens is when you start
bending<00:06:42.240> it<00:06:42.360> instead<00:06:43.080> of<00:06:43.139> getting<00:06:43.440> a<00:06:43.500> nice

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:43.620 
bending it instead of getting a nice

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:46.129 
bending it instead of getting a nice
smooth<00:06:44.009> curve<00:06:44.399> all<00:06:45.089> of<00:06:45.630> a<00:06:45.690> sudden<00:06:45.990> one<00:06:46.110> of

00:06:46.129 --> 00:06:46.139 
smooth curve all of a sudden one of

00:06:46.139 --> 00:06:47.090 
smooth curve all of a sudden one of
these<00:06:46.320> will<00:06:46.500> collapse<00:06:46.740> and

00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:47.100 
these will collapse and

00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:49.370 
these will collapse and
like<00:06:47.370> some<00:06:48.330> kind<00:06:48.570> of<00:06:48.600> a<00:06:48.690> piece<00:06:48.870> it's<00:06:49.050> coming<00:06:49.260> up

00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:49.380 
like some kind of a piece it's coming up

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:51.070 
like some kind of a piece it's coming up
and<00:06:49.650> then<00:06:49.740> it<00:06:49.860> starts<00:06:50.190> tingling<00:06:50.490> back<00:06:50.760> down

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:51.080 
and then it starts tingling back down

00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:53.390 
and then it starts tingling back down
and<00:06:52.080> so<00:06:52.260> this<00:06:52.410> is<00:06:52.530> even<00:06:52.800> with<00:06:52.920> a<00:06:52.950> smoother

00:06:53.390 --> 00:06:53.400 
and so this is even with a smoother

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:56.180 
and so this is even with a smoother
service<00:06:53.910> and<00:06:54.410> you<00:06:55.410> know<00:06:55.530> we'll<00:06:55.680> start<00:06:55.890> to<00:06:55.950> form

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:56.190 
service and you know we'll start to form

00:06:56.190 --> 00:06:57.410 
service and you know we'll start to form
something<00:06:56.460> that<00:06:56.610> looks<00:06:56.850> a<00:06:56.940> little<00:06:57.000> bit<00:06:57.180> closer

00:06:57.410 --> 00:06:57.420 
something that looks a little bit closer

00:06:57.420 --> 00:06:59.750 
something that looks a little bit closer
to<00:06:57.660> what<00:06:57.780> the<00:06:57.900> actual<00:06:58.110> end<00:06:58.980> product<00:06:59.490> will<00:06:59.610> look

00:06:59.750 --> 00:06:59.760 
to what the actual end product will look

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:02.480 
to what the actual end product will look
like<00:06:59.870> and<00:07:00.870> you'd<00:07:01.710> be<00:07:01.830> amazed<00:07:02.160> at<00:07:02.340> how<00:07:02.430> strong

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:02.490 
like and you'd be amazed at how strong

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:06.410 
like and you'd be amazed at how strong
this<00:07:02.940> is<00:07:03.090> with<00:07:03.300> all<00:07:03.390> the<00:07:03.480> hot<00:07:03.630> glue<00:07:05.210> so<00:07:06.210> that's

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:06.420 
this is with all the hot glue so that's

00:07:06.420 --> 00:07:08.150 
this is with all the hot glue so that's
kind<00:07:06.630> of<00:07:06.690> a<00:07:06.780> rat<00:07:07.020> and<00:07:07.290> hopefully<00:07:07.770> today<00:07:07.920> I<00:07:08.040> can

00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:08.160 
kind of a rat and hopefully today I can

00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:11.210 
kind of a rat and hopefully today I can
get<00:07:08.490> the<00:07:08.610> rest<00:07:08.760> this<00:07:08.970> corner<00:07:09.530> formed<00:07:10.530> I'll

00:07:11.210 --> 00:07:11.220 
get the rest this corner formed I'll

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:12.560 
get the rest this corner formed I'll
step<00:07:11.430> back<00:07:11.460> and<00:07:11.910> kind<00:07:12.030> of<00:07:12.120> see<00:07:12.270> what<00:07:12.450> it's

00:07:12.560 --> 00:07:12.570 
step back and kind of see what it's

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:15.890 
step back and kind of see what it's
starting<00:07:12.990> to<00:07:13.080> look<00:07:13.230> like<00:07:14.270> so<00:07:15.270> much<00:07:15.390> stuff<00:07:15.660> in

00:07:15.890 --> 00:07:15.900 
starting to look like so much stuff in

00:07:15.900 --> 00:07:18.740 
starting to look like so much stuff in
here<00:07:16.110> everything's<00:07:16.500> in<00:07:16.620> the<00:07:16.680> way<00:07:16.830> that<00:07:17.750> you

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:18.750 
here everything's in the way that you

00:07:18.750 --> 00:07:22.220 
here everything's in the way that you
kind<00:07:18.930> of<00:07:18.990> see<00:07:19.050> right<00:07:19.200> there's<00:07:19.620> the<00:07:19.920> bow<00:07:21.230> and

00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:22.230 
kind of see right there's the bow and

00:07:22.230 --> 00:07:24.020 
kind of see right there's the bow and
you<00:07:22.260> can<00:07:22.470> kind<00:07:22.650> of<00:07:22.680> see<00:07:22.860> is<00:07:23.010> it<00:07:23.190> starts<00:07:23.880> to

00:07:24.020 --> 00:07:24.030 
you can kind of see is it starts to

00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:26.840 
you can kind of see is it starts to
curve<00:07:24.240> around<00:07:24.390> I<00:07:25.170> think<00:07:25.920> the<00:07:26.130> shape<00:07:26.340> starting

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:26.850 
curve around I think the shape starting

00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:29.150 
curve around I think the shape starting
to<00:07:27.090> get<00:07:27.240> there<00:07:27.570> I<00:07:27.840> still<00:07:28.440> think<00:07:28.530> the<00:07:28.740> Balinese

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:29.160 
to get there I still think the Balinese

00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:31.280 
to get there I still think the Balinese
to<00:07:29.340> have<00:07:29.550> a<00:07:29.850> steeper<00:07:30.240> angle<00:07:30.420> on<00:07:30.750> it<00:07:30.780> so<00:07:31.050> we<00:07:31.140> may

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:31.290 
to have a steeper angle on it so we may

00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:34.430 
to have a steeper angle on it so we may
be<00:07:31.350> doing<00:07:31.620> the<00:07:31.710> skin<00:07:32.960> fitting<00:07:33.960> that's<00:07:34.140> kind<00:07:34.410> of

00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:34.440 
be doing the skin fitting that's kind of

00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:36.290 
be doing the skin fitting that's kind of
a<00:07:34.590> interesting<00:07:35.280> shape<00:07:35.490> something<00:07:35.910> different

00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:36.300 
a interesting shape something different

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:38.420 
a interesting shape something different
I<00:07:37.020> hope<00:07:37.350> you<00:07:37.470> guys<00:07:37.590> have<00:07:37.800> a<00:07:37.830> great<00:07:38.040> Black
