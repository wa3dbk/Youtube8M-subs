00:00:03.730 --> 00:00:07.990
 we are beginning to see in this process 

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:09.790
 where there will be elections next 7 

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:13.420
 of July in 14 states of the republic 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:14.949
 a citizen 's manifestation through 

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:17.500
 the social networks that goes against 

00:00:14.949 --> 00:00:19.690
 the elections that mocks the 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:22.240
 democracy making you feel that there is no 

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:24.369
 such when political parties do 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.619
 everything possible and also the impossible 

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:28.210
 for winning the elections starting with 

00:00:26.619 --> 00:00:31.449
 the political party in power that is 

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:33.190
 the pri we all know of the last century 

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:36.460
 that the pri is a political party 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:38.469
 cheater who has raccoons and who does 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:41.800
 all kinds of operations that have to 

00:00:38.469 --> 00:00:44.559
 see with the alteration or nobody is in doubt 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:46.809
 win the elections the problem does not 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:48.789
 is that they win the elections but as 

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:50.980
 they win the elections and after having 

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:53.440
 already lost a couple of times 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.929
 when they recover 12 years 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.929
 after the presidency with peÃ±a grandson 

00:00:54.929 --> 00:01:02.170
 now the pri does all the operative 

00:00:58.929 --> 00:01:05.230
 general since the power to exercise 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:07.930
 this through not only what 

00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:09.909
 could be the control of the 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:12.490
 electoral institutions 

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:15.429
 as well as the federal one but the 

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:18.450
 control itself by the very important way 

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:21.520
 of the governors who put their hands 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:24.399
 completely with money with operation 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.939
 with logistics and with everything possible 

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:30.069
 I also insist on the impossible to win 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:34.599
 obviously this has made the 

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:37.359
 citizens put cats or dogs or 

00:01:34.599 --> 00:01:39.579
 even pigs to become 

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:41.770
 candidates for a certain position 

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:44.069
 popular election and with all this in the 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:47.229
 social networks are already seen out there to the 

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:49.060
 candidates or cats that in 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:52.390
 different points of the republic 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:54.819
 mexicana are proclaimed as the most 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:57.280
 celebrities and the possible winners of a 

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:59.770
 process this clear when voting 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:03.039
 for an animal that is good I speak of 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:05.469
 animals and evidently the vote is 

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:09.700
 would annul and this is as much as a vote 

00:02:05.469 --> 00:02:11.950
 so a null vote but more than that here 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.690
 there is a clear animosity for the 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.760
 political sector 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:18.160
 which is in nexus with that of 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:21.910
 society in this country we are full 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:25.210
 of ceremonies of talks engoladas in 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:28.120
 where politicians talk with a lot 

00:02:25.210 --> 00:02:29.920
 eloquence about everything great 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.110
 what can your projects be 

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:34.510
 planning towards the present and towards the 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:37.900
 future and while they get pleasure 

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:40.600
 with his narcissism the citizenship 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:43.530
 despairs when he sees how good he had 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:46.840
 announced the mexican moment the memo 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:49.270
 moment that seems to be happening without 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:52.180
 nobody notices that Mexico can take 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:56.470
 advantage of what today unfortunately 

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:59.050
 is going in diatribe candidate cats or 

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:03.720
 dogs gives me the impression that is 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:03.720
 dodgy can climb to more
