00:00:01.009 --> 00:00:04.430
 I think I would have real GDP in those 

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:06.380
 and I have extra on 

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:08.439
 a crap race left out 

00:00:08.439 --> 00:00:11.309
 a team my ex Kerstin Stremmel 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.379
 by Peter Korn if any praise than not I think then boss Chapman 

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:17.730
 remains a blockbuster could show 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.730
 Andy did not just leave Kingstons kitchen way and way too 

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:25.749
 Anniversary of the park is first a black shirt Spreng Schavan had 

00:00:25.749 --> 00:00:27.239
 Karim students a conversation 

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:30.499
 By the way, it also has to do when the hair is open and then just 

00:00:30.499 --> 00:00:32.280
 lure everywhere Tappara 

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:35.890
 This is the fastest way for me and Citrate, of course 

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:38.480
 without the course of the sixth highest of I find 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:39.390
 at least 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.900
 on the Lech that way 

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:46.080
 yes and then after party HSP sought so much like the plays 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:47.780
 dear of Cartier 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.390
 thus rich neighbor a candidate states which once from the left 

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.220
 GÃ¼nther that the model 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:55.710
 counts the 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.710
 - Goals 76 

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:01.240
 quantity 

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:04.410
 Bilfinger Berger white wind turbines between 1 but I would be it now 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:05.720
 leave differently 

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.510
 and indeed you can already see the American big one on 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.090
 the following circumstance that she is something think Ramones and operates 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.070
 but that does not belong to the team, it stays that way 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.200
 The important thing is that I make it up the uncomfortable and not down 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:25.080
 because then the data is added that is a few seconds 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.040
 and the longer the more so hold 

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:30.460
 that is, be closer to the data or 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.970
 Price a tidbit to have a bit bigger 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.970
 she does not like it too long &amp; Cie then briefly again 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.880
 and if they take it for a rest 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.090
 yes that's it as already said 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:44.520
 if necessary exhausting 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.520
 you comment on a good game 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.940
 laughed next to everyone 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:51.830
 maybe Esslinger Platzeck, then 

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:54.150
 Konno back to top 

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:57.150
 lay dry 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:01.840
 take care that I do not burn my fingers 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.550
 Keep competitors 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:04.900
 - to let 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.340
 now EA has to select them 

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.999
 Wallenstein, if he does not know yet, will fall even more naturally 

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:14.519
 and as I said the left only in Australia so have the hot everything 

00:02:14.519 --> 00:02:16.089
 also more often 

00:02:16.089 --> 00:02:19.259
 if the curling iron then better in Iran the rag 

00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:20.369
 Harms 

00:02:20.369 --> 00:02:23.369
 In the end, give up a bit more Hasselt 

00:02:25.669 --> 00:02:28.669
 ste 

00:02:30.109 --> 00:02:31.620
 probably was 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.980
 By contrast, the guests were Hofmann
