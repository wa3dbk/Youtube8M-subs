00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.179
 is it to him the peaks to her account in 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:04.049
 find for a new video on 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:06.629
 qr codes 

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:09.030
 then following your request this is the 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:10.260
 kind fact who won so in this 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.300
 video you'll see all the pokemon 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.199
 of type does so from the moment when 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.820
 there are not many dispo codes 

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:20.310
 for a guy I can try to 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.529
 provide fairly quickly from the 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.090
 moment when if i'm going to attack the typo 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.460
 do not expect to see the video the 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.599
 next day because the typo is pretty 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.679
 provided I believe there are more than 100 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:34.079
 pokemon in the end so it'll be pretty 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.450
 hot enough to do all types or 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.940
 in one day 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:40.800
 a talk let's go on all of 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.320
 next with the qr codes you see 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.620
 this is a megalith arias although was 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.210
 present in the video of the dragons I 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:53.340
 you put it in the facts anyway 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:55.350
 then it's useless to say in the 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:58.079
 code comments do not work 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.789
 it sucks you do not even check your 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:01.949
 work it's not true I tried them 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:04.229
 they work and tell you well that 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.240
 you tell me it does not work and that 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.320
 other steps so it does not come from 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.710
 me it is you who did 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.020
 Something 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.150
 updated console update 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:14.909
 pokemon shuffle also cancels the entry 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.830
 qr codes or updates 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.200
 any nintendo game they have 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:20.670
 managed to block qr codes 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.780
 from the moment you make a 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:26.610
 only game updates 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:28.650
 available so check before you say 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:30.270
 it's my fault 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.600
 otherwise you can vote for others 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.430
 types to it still does 16 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.990
 I wanted without checking what they have 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.740
 already been done or not I'm going to put them 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.950
 a comment 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.540
 what has already been made a link to 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.060
 the videos that we 've already been doing like that 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.280
 you can also search to see if 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.110
 I did them I say a lot me the 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.970
 word is there anyway 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:52.650
 anyway and I hope this video 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:54.750
 you will have liked 

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:56.190
 remember to like the shared video there and 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.020
 of course subscribe if it's not 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:59.460
 already done to take advantage of 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:00.240
 actuaries code that will be available 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.810
