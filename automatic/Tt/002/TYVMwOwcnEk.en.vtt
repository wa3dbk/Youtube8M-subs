00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.750
 hello to all today we're going 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.130
 talk about a new pokemon versions 

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.460
 x and y 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.800
 mr x they add to what we 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.980
 could call the pokemon cat next 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:17.010
 of father cyan del cati chaffre e and 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.960
 leopard of that by the way we can note 

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:20.490
 that these four pokemon in addition to not 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.529
 to be played a lot have statistics 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:26.039
 a little bit means and that's also the 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:28.380
 case of mr x it's fast but its 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:30.660
 other statistics really are not 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.730
 terrible he will defend himself in attack 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.380
 special but it's really fragile and 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.780
 his physical attack is very bad 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.460
 its great particularity is that in addition 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.930
 to have a different appearance there 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.690
 will not learn the same thing if he 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.980
 is a male or a female 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:46.320
 there is also a difference for the 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.840
 special abilities or talent every 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.969
 two after life and infiltration look 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.360
 but the third talent the hidden talent 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.949
 is different the male jester joker 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.219
 while the female can have 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:01.530
 competitive in strategy all these 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:05.820
 abilities are really very little useful 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:07.650
 anything but joker so the choice the most 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:11.310
 interesting is to choose a mistigri 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:13.439
 hurts with his talent hidden by his 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.299
 it's a special ability that makes 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:18.030
 pass the status attacks in 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:20.460
 prioritize wholesale attacks like 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.530
 toxic to madness or even boosts 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.110
 as in slam will be launched before 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.990
 your opponent is the big advantage 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:28.900
 is that mr x learns a lot of what 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.570
 it 's nothing 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:33.760
 this special ability I you 

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:36.030
 really advise to use clear kg 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:38.560
 who will benefit from this special ability 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.320
 kg clear it paralyzes your opponent 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:43.900
 is an adversary paralyzed his voice his 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.560
 speed deeply diminished and in addition 

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.470
 of that 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.970
 regularly it can not attack 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.190
 then I propose to play it with 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:54.760
 fullness that will also pass first 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:56.920
 thanks to joker fullness it increases the 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:59.440
 special tax and broke down the special 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.750
 pokemon like that go in priority with 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:03.430
 joker that rather of course mistigri 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:05.320
 attention it remains extremely fragile 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:07.750
 he does not have good defenses and no 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:09.760
 a lot of pv's best to have a 

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:12.130
 attack stab and that is to say the type of 

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:16.180
 our pokemon is to use psycho or 

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:17.500
 psycho shock in last attack there is 

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.600
 several choices 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.160
 you can put ecosphere that me 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:24.060
 seems best for the cover of 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:26.230
 thunder type even ben in london 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:29.370
 I think this set is the most 

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:32.500
 competitive and the most adapted to pokemon 

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:35.140
 for ev you can maximize the 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:38.200
 special tax and apportion the remaining ev 

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:40.180
 between pv and speed so that 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.280
 the object the remains is in my opinion the 

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:44.950
 wise choice even if it is a 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.390
 little bit fragile but watch out as 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.459
 he learns a lot of attack ago 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.110
 other ways to play it that can 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:52.900
 also be rather nice 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:54.760
 we can for example use misty 

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:57.790
 claw to place the walls light and 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:59.860
 protection or even use jokers 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:02.680
 to be sure to place a change 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:04.650
 from the ground he learns zenith rain dance 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.959
 and distortions 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.760
 if you absolutely want to play mistigri 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:11.310
 qs female because like me you 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.159
 find really cute is still 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.720
 way and I'll explain how 

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:18.090
 in fact we can play about the 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:20.610
 same way with psycho fullness 

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:22.079
 thunder ecosphere but I you 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:24.720
 advises to keep the capacity rather 

00:03:22.079 --> 00:03:27.090
 special infiltrations that will be the 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.799
 best of the three promised it allows 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:30.090
 especially to go through the clubs 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:32.459
 where the protective walls 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:34.109
 on the other hand let's be clear as I 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:35.819
 you said at the beginning of the video these 

00:03:34.109 --> 00:03:38.250
 two pokemon have some statistics 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:39.319
 average so they do not expect 

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.889
 to be absolutely 

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:42.900
 exceptional 

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:44.909
 more than the type if their unique 

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.409
 psych ticket it's good but it's not 

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:48.989
 no longer the best of types 

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:50.790
 it is therefore necessary to surround them well and 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:53.549
 for that I advise you first 

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:56.040
 to choose a pokemon steel type for 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:58.709
 play with mystic x10 bubbles 

00:03:56.040 --> 00:04:01.620
 ox shears or pingo leon will be very 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:03.840
 very good play with our pokÃ©mon he 

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:05.849
 will also be pretty much played with the 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.879
 pokemon-type combat that completes 

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:11.010
 rather well the weaknesses of the psy 

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:12.750
 shao martin colo monkeys or capoeira 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:15.389
 will be for example quite 

00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:16.889
 interesting here that I hope she gets 

00:04:15.389 --> 00:04:19.709
 like played on a new pokemon 

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:21.329
 versions x and y will have pleased you and I 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:23.780
 tell you very soon for others 

00:04:21.329 --> 00:04:23.780
 videos
