I've<00:03:16.560> seen<00:03:16.709> as<00:03:16.800> you<00:03:16.890> know<00:03:16.980> with<00:03:17.100> the<00:03:17.190> quality

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:17.430 
I've seen as you know with the quality

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.020 
I've seen as you know with the quality
we've<00:03:17.760> got<00:03:17.940> why<00:03:18.150> have<00:03:18.270> we<00:03:18.360> not<00:03:18.480> performed<00:03:19.070> in<00:03:20.070> a

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
we've got why have we not performed in a

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.150 
we've got why have we not performed in a
better<00:03:21.270> manner<00:03:21.540> and<00:03:21.870> more<00:03:22.050> like<00:03:22.200> maybe<00:03:22.380> a<00:03:22.620> last

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
better manner and more like maybe a last

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.610 
better manner and more like maybe a last
season<00:03:23.520> I<00:03:23.730> think<00:03:24.630> that<00:03:24.750> as<00:03:24.870> under<00:03:25.170> the<00:03:25.410> other

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620 
season I think that as under the other

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:26.840 
season I think that as under the other
reasons<00:03:26.040> for<00:03:26.160> that<00:03:26.250> I<00:03:26.310> think<00:03:26.550> that<00:03:26.580> you<00:03:26.760> know

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
reasons for that I think that you know

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:28.670 
reasons for that I think that you know
those<00:03:27.060> there<00:03:27.810> is<00:03:27.930> a<00:03:27.959> change<00:03:28.320> it's<00:03:28.500> a<00:03:28.560> new

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:28.680 
those there is a change it's a new

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.590 
those there is a change it's a new
manager<00:03:28.950> commanders<00:03:29.580> always<00:03:29.910> going<00:03:30.090> to<00:03:30.150> be<00:03:30.209> be

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
manager commanders always going to be be

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.540 
manager commanders always going to be be
changes<00:03:31.050> and<00:03:31.950> obviously<00:03:32.310> I<00:03:32.370> think

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:32.550 
changes and obviously I think

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:34.100 
changes and obviously I think
everybody's<00:03:33.000> where<00:03:33.150> our<00:03:33.300> way<00:03:33.420> of<00:03:33.540> it<00:03:33.690> you<00:03:34.020> know

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:34.110 
everybody's where our way of it you know

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:35.540 
everybody's where our way of it you know
there<00:03:34.260> will<00:03:34.380> have<00:03:34.680> to<00:03:34.740> be<00:03:34.890> changes<00:03:35.340> in<00:03:35.370> the

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:13.990 
absolutely not sure
I<00:04:11.799> think<00:04:12.799> Paul<00:04:13.010> Wambach<00:04:13.459> said<00:04:13.640> it<00:04:13.760> had<00:04:13.970> a

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.000 
I think Paul Wambach said it had a

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.610 
I think Paul Wambach said it had a
difficult<00:04:14.480> job<00:04:14.659> there<00:04:14.900> you<00:04:15.079> know<00:04:15.200> he<00:04:15.349> has<00:04:15.530> to

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.620 
difficult job there you know he has to

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:17.409 
difficult job there you know he has to
decide<00:04:15.890> to<00:04:16.040> alter<00:04:16.340> the<00:04:16.609> budget<00:04:17.000> there<00:04:17.150> and

00:04:17.409 --> 00:04:17.419 
decide to alter the budget there and

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:20.229 
decide to alter the budget there and
change<00:04:18.079> a<00:04:18.260> little<00:04:18.350> bit<00:04:18.530> of<00:04:18.709> that<00:04:19.579> we've<00:04:19.790> ever

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 
change a little bit of that we've ever

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:23.050 
change a little bit of that we've ever
done<00:04:20.660> it<00:04:20.810> in<00:04:20.840> the<00:04:20.930> past<00:04:20.989> and<00:04:21.580> for<00:04:22.580> such<00:04:22.790> a<00:04:22.820> big
