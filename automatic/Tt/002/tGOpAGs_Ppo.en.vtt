00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
a little better and then I'll just kind

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.180 
a little better and then I'll just kind

00:03:58.710 --> 00:03:58.720 
difference I might have tried that up in

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:03.490 
difference I might have tried that up in
a<00:03:58.840> trapeze<00:03:58.990> here

00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:03.500

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:52.200 

all<00:04:47.780> right<00:04:48.550> fifty<00:04:49.550> is<00:04:49.610> one<00:04:49.760> more<00:04:49.910> salt<00:04:51.190> now

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:52.210 
all right fifty is one more salt now

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:54.640 
all right fifty is one more salt now
it's<00:04:53.210> sort<00:04:53.360> of<00:04:53.510> dry<00:04:53.750> on<00:04:53.930> the<00:04:54.050> outside<00:04:54.080> where<00:04:54.620> I

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:54.650 
it's sort of dry on the outside where I

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:57.580 
it's sort of dry on the outside where I
tried<00:04:54.950> to<00:04:55.510> use<00:04:56.510> it<00:04:56.540> torch<00:04:56.990> so<00:04:57.230> I'm<00:04:57.290> gonna<00:04:57.410> try<00:04:57.560> a

00:04:57.580 --> 00:04:57.590 
tried to use it torch so I'm gonna try a

00:04:57.590 --> 00:04:59.020 
tried to use it torch so I'm gonna try a
little<00:04:57.680> bit<00:04:57.830> all<00:04:58.040> the<00:04:58.190> way<00:04:58.250> on<00:04:58.400> this<00:04:58.580> one<00:04:58.640> tool

00:04:59.020 --> 00:04:59.030 
little bit all the way on this one tool

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:12.850 
little bit all the way on this one tool
will<00:04:59.600> suit<00:04:59.750> the<00:04:59.900> differences

00:05:12.850 --> 00:05:12.860 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:19.720 

okay

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:19.730 

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:23.380 

so<00:05:20.330> so<00:05:20.510> far<00:05:20.720> I<00:05:20.780> sort<00:05:21.230> of<00:05:21.760> like<00:05:22.760> the<00:05:23.090> pan

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:23.390 
so so far I sort of like the pan

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:25.630 
so so far I sort of like the pan
approach<00:05:23.840> to<00:05:24.260> finishing<00:05:24.980> off<00:05:25.220> the<00:05:25.460> dish

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:25.640 
approach to finishing off the dish

00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:32.710 
approach to finishing off the dish
better<00:05:27.430> then<00:05:28.430> using<00:05:28.730> the<00:05:28.820> blowtorch<00:05:31.720> we're

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:32.720 
better then using the blowtorch we're

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:37.360 
better then using the blowtorch we're
going<00:05:32.840> to<00:05:32.900> give<00:05:32.990> this<00:05:33.140> one<00:05:33.320> a<00:05:33.380> shot<00:05:36.190> holes<00:05:37.190> in

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:37.370 
going to give this one a shot holes in

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:41.950 
going to give this one a shot holes in
the<00:05:37.490> camera<00:05:37.880> in<00:05:40.060> see<00:05:41.060> the<00:05:41.210> sous<00:05:41.390> vide<00:05:41.540> supreme

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:41.960

over on that side okay
two<00:05:50.740> minutes<00:05:51.009> left<00:05:51.159> on<00:05:51.370> the<00:05:51.520> film<00:05:52.469> so<00:05:53.469> make<00:05:53.740> it

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:53.770 
two minutes left on the film so make it

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:20.090
