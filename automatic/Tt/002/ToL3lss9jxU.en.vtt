00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
spark of light is pretty much it's a

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.389 
spark of light is pretty much it's a
consumable<00:00:35.820> that<00:00:36.600> allows<00:00:37.500> you<00:00:38.160> to

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
automatically go to 25 I'll actually

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.459 
automatically go to 25 I'll actually
even<00:00:40.800> read<00:00:41.129> the<00:00:41.309> description<00:00:41.850> of<00:00:41.969> it<00:00:42.239> and<00:00:42.540> I

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
even read the description of it and I

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:44.569 
even read the description of it and I
will<00:00:43.620> actually<00:00:43.890> pop<00:00:44.010> it<00:00:44.190> up<00:00:44.250> on<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.460> screen

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579
