00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:33.690

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:35.230

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:40.420

 Remodeling that came up to brother channel when saying Dodd house 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:48.670
 According to the report of the person who possesses the pirate a 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:50.700
 In that empty period, if it is possible to receive an order, it means that there is no judgment on that monster. 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:55.140
 We now have 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:56.590
 When stability is lost and what does this mean? 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:58.060
 Huh 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:06.720
 I can not pass 

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:06.720
 That's why it's such a thing if you don't get the rewards you can get 

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:14.130
 I guess it is that Tteyuu became difficult to do rather than can not Well

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:32.870
 After all 

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:39.290
 I'm a guy who relies on Saizo 

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:42.620
 Certainly, remodeling or non-playing stores Somehow people are already free from how 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:45.040
 But it is not good to bother others 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:45.040
 After all 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:52.260

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:57.170
 I'm looking forward to this measure 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:59.920

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:59.920

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.420
 I already say too many measures too late 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.410
 I guess I also 

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:51.780
 It is not a remodel but it is a body that loses Lajan or Saddle, though 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:55.400
 Why isn't it so in the middle of the night on hackers surface 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.400
