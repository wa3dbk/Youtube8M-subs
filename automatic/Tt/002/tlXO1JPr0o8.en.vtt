00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:10.270
 Augsburger Rathausplatz started the beach volleyball tournament this morning 

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:13.719
 and just in time for the start, the sun came out so that on the square 

00:00:13.719 --> 00:00:17.320
 real picture Swede was played until Sunday in the tournaments 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.410
 Groups recreational teams clubs politics and sponsors can watch 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:25.289
 They have 1000 spectators for free in the stands Melanie 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.289
 Wollscheid and that may be report 

00:00:28.819 --> 00:00:32.469
 The sun is sand and peaks of the athletes currently on the Town Hall Square 

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:34.679
 predominant mixture has it all 

00:00:34.679 --> 00:00:37.149
 It offers the perfect backdrop for this year's 

00:00:37.149 --> 00:00:40.789
 beach volleyball tournament and Lord Mayor Paul Wengert 

00:00:40.789 --> 00:00:43.190
 about the nice view from his office 

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.290
 it is similar to a confession ready because I always have the 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:47.890
 Fragrance and Debussy 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.630
 yes in the nose or in the ears and sometimes that's the case 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:55.320
 work a bit harder when I hear the music of Basil now 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.990
 beach volleyball tournament also quarrels with scary books now and then 

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:02.720
 through the window from the conference room and they see how people play 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:05.760
 and how excited is how many spectators there are I am too 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.750
 Advisory board members CIA under Bush so to speak also of official times times the 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.060
 Look round 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.950
 He was so enthusiastic about the tournament 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.020
 to open in person 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.640
 and that after a half year injury-related sports break but 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.600
 also the other athletes made a good figure on the pitch despite some 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.909
 scarce preparation time, the results were quite 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:28.050
 let see 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:31.050
 2 won 1 so lost a good balance 

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.030
 because this is around 11 o'clock 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:35.750
 the Dane 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.750
 Goar percent 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.250
 with so much enthusiasm, the organizer is looking forward to it 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:45.360
 he is on the Saturday encounters 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.970
 then one or the other political battle will be in the sand 

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:50.950
 fought 

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.780
 now in the course of the election campaign am very curious 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.760
 how serious about that percent of that fleet-footed beach volleyball tournament 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.520
 has played as I believe the give themselves nothing that will be in the 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.480
 Stuff there are some who do that very well and some who do that 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:08.629
 Touching Ball for the first time Aldi is looking forward to it 

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:12.760
 until then, both professionals and amateurs will prove their ball feeling for 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.060
 The viewers are not only hot views and cold drinks 

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:19.870
 but also have free seating in the stands and even the little ones 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:23.850
 their fun at the sports event some even train for their own 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:25.629
 Participation in a few years
