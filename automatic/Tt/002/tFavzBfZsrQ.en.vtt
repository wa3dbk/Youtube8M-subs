forest and you're about to step on one

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:31.640 
forest and you're about to step on one

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
but still it doesn't move and that's the

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.520 
but still it doesn't move and that's the
problem<00:00:34.590> with<00:00:34.890> this<00:00:35.070> snake<00:00:36.050> this<00:00:37.050> is<00:00:37.200> why<00:00:37.320> so

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
problem with this snake this is why so

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.280 
problem with this snake this is why so
many<00:00:37.649> people<00:00:37.770> are<00:00:38.070> bitten<00:00:38.340> by<00:00:38.430> it<00:00:39.290> they're

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
many people are bitten by it they're

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:47.290 
many people are bitten by it they're
fast<00:00:40.739> to<00:00:40.980> bite<00:00:41.190> and<00:00:43.430> the<00:00:44.430> venom<00:00:44.760> is<00:00:44.910> very<00:00:45.300> toxic

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:47.300 
fast to bite and the venom is very toxic

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.970 
fast to bite and the venom is very toxic
cytotoxic<00:00:48.300> so<00:00:48.450> it<00:00:48.539> destroys<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:49.110> cells

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:51.980 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:56.330 

destroys<00:00:52.980> the<00:00:53.219> UM<00:00:53.340> wool<00:00:53.730> boy<00:00:55.039> he's<00:00:56.039> really<00:00:56.070> a

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:56.340 
destroys the UM wool boy he's really a

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:56.900 
destroys the UM wool boy he's really a
biter

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
biter

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:06.139 
biter
like<00:00:57.210> my<00:00:57.360> friend<00:00:57.629> said

00:01:06.139 --> 00:01:06.149 

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:09.120 

they<00:01:07.149> actually<00:01:07.329> the<00:01:07.810> taught<00:01:08.049> the<00:01:08.380> venom<00:01:08.799> is<00:01:08.950> so

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:09.130 
they actually the taught the venom is so

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:12.420 
they actually the taught the venom is so
toxic<00:01:09.430> that<00:01:09.700> it<00:01:09.939> melts<00:01:10.149> the<00:01:10.329> bone<00:01:10.979> if<00:01:11.979> you<00:01:12.250> can

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:12.430 
toxic that it melts the bone if you can

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:15.810 
toxic that it melts the bone if you can
believe<00:01:12.579> that<00:01:13.770> it<00:01:14.770> will<00:01:14.920> destroy<00:01:15.250> all<00:01:15.280> cells

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:15.820 
believe that it will destroy all cells

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:17.520 
believe that it will destroy all cells
but<00:01:16.060> even<00:01:16.329> the<00:01:16.479> bones<00:01:16.659> that<00:01:16.930> will<00:01:17.049> just<00:01:17.259> melt

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:17.530 
but even the bones that will just melt

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:22.350 
but even the bones that will just melt
turn<00:01:18.009> to<00:01:18.250> to<00:01:18.909> jelly<00:01:20.759> so<00:01:21.759> these<00:01:21.909> are<00:01:22.090> the<00:01:22.179> worst

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:22.360 
turn to to jelly so these are the worst

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.910 
turn to to jelly so these are the worst
snakes<00:01:22.689> to<00:01:22.929> encounter<00:01:23.590> in<00:01:23.890> Thailand<00:01:25.920> most

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:26.920 
snakes to encounter in Thailand most

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:28.740 
snakes to encounter in Thailand most
people<00:01:27.280> will<00:01:27.490> not<00:01:27.640> die<00:01:27.880> if<00:01:28.119> you<00:01:28.270> get<00:01:28.390> bit<00:01:28.569> by<00:01:28.600> it

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:28.750 
people will not die if you get bit by it

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:30.029 
people will not die if you get bit by it
and<00:01:29.020> you<00:01:29.110> go<00:01:29.200> to<00:01:29.259> the<00:01:29.409> hospital<00:01:29.890> right<00:01:29.920> away

00:01:30.029 --> 00:01:30.039 
and you go to the hospital right away

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:31.200 
and you go to the hospital right away
you're<00:01:30.310> going<00:01:30.429> to<00:01:30.520> be<00:01:30.610> okay

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.210 
you're going to be okay

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:33.630 
you're going to be okay
it's<00:01:31.899> just<00:01:32.110> that<00:01:32.289> most<00:01:32.439> people<00:01:32.829> don't<00:01:32.979> do<00:01:33.189> that

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:33.640 
it's just that most people don't do that

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:37.380 
it's just that most people don't do that
I<00:01:33.670> guess<00:01:34.299> Thai<00:01:34.539> people<00:01:34.810> they<00:01:35.110> they<00:01:36.030> do<00:01:37.030> like

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:37.390 
I guess Thai people they they do like

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:39.570 
I guess Thai people they they do like
rub<00:01:37.689> leaves<00:01:37.959> on<00:01:38.200> it<00:01:38.380> or<00:01:38.530> something<00:01:38.770> some<00:01:39.189> some

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:39.580 
rub leaves on it or something some some

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.160 
rub leaves on it or something some some
kind<00:01:39.789> of<00:01:39.880> um<00:01:41.189> some<00:01:42.189> kind<00:01:42.369> of<00:01:42.459> their<00:01:42.610> own

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
kind of um some kind of their own

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.499 
kind of um some kind of their own
treatment<00:01:44.170> and<00:01:44.759> it's<00:01:45.759> you<00:01:46.090> know<00:01:46.119> it's<00:01:46.360> not

00:01:46.499 --> 00:01:46.509 
treatment and it's you know it's not

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:58.030 
treatment and it's you know it's not
going<00:01:46.689> to<00:01:46.780> work

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:58.040 

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.000 

anyway<00:01:59.040> you<00:01:59.130> can<00:01:59.280> see<00:01:59.310> in<00:01:59.580> against<00:02:00.119> this<00:02:00.299> uh

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:01.010 
anyway you can see in against this uh

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:03.550 
anyway you can see in against this uh
against<00:02:02.010> this<00:02:02.190> dirt<00:02:02.520> against<00:02:03.000> these<00:02:03.150> stones

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
against this dirt against these stones

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.080 
against this dirt against these stones
you<00:02:04.560> can't<00:02:04.799> really<00:02:05.010> see<00:02:05.310> the<00:02:05.460> snake<00:02:05.729> all<00:02:05.909> that

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:06.090 
you can't really see the snake all that

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.870 
you can't really see the snake all that
well<00:02:06.740> let's<00:02:07.740> stand<00:02:07.979> back<00:02:08.069> here<00:02:08.459> and<00:02:08.670> you<00:02:08.850> can

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 
well let's stand back here and you can

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.630 
well let's stand back here and you can
you<00:02:09.300> can<00:02:09.479> see<00:02:09.750> it<00:02:09.890> unless<00:02:10.890> you're<00:02:11.130> looking<00:02:11.250> for

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
you can see it unless you're looking for

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.150 
you can see it unless you're looking for
it<00:02:11.730> you're<00:02:11.850> not<00:02:11.940> going<00:02:12.120> to<00:02:12.240> see<00:02:12.450> it<00:02:12.569> and<00:02:13.160> that's

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.160 
it you're not going to see it and that's

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.620 
it you're not going to see it and that's
another<00:02:14.430> problem<00:02:14.700> with<00:02:14.970> these<00:02:15.120> snakes<00:02:15.450> they

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
another problem with these snakes they

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.350 
another problem with these snakes they
tend<00:02:15.870> to<00:02:15.989> be<00:02:16.110> on<00:02:16.230> the<00:02:16.260> leaves<00:02:17.090> I'll<00:02:18.090> show<00:02:18.270> you

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
tend to be on the leaves I'll show you

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.530 
tend to be on the leaves I'll show you
some<00:02:18.569> of<00:02:18.600> the<00:02:18.750> leaves<00:02:18.989> in<00:02:19.290> the<00:02:19.319> area<00:02:19.800> here<00:02:20.540> are

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
some of the leaves in the area here are

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:27.290 
some of the leaves in the area here are
like<00:02:22.050> this<00:02:24.470> so<00:02:25.470> it<00:02:25.650> matches<00:02:26.100> the<00:02:26.340> pattern<00:02:26.970> of

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
like this so it matches the pattern of

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.400 
like this so it matches the pattern of
the<00:02:27.390> snake<00:02:27.690> very<00:02:27.930> well<00:02:29.269> and<00:02:30.269> I<00:02:30.810> let<00:02:31.019> this<00:02:31.170> snake

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:31.410 
the snake very well and I let this snake

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:33.199 
the snake very well and I let this snake
go<00:02:31.590> way<00:02:31.769> out<00:02:31.800> here<00:02:32.160> because<00:02:32.310> it's<00:02:32.640> away<00:02:33.030> from

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
go way out here because it's away from

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:45.680 
go way out here because it's away from
the<00:02:33.450> away<00:02:34.080> from<00:02:34.140> people<00:02:34.709> and<00:02:41.450> oops

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:50.300 

away<00:02:46.320> from<00:02:46.380> people<00:02:46.740> and<00:02:47.310> hopefully<00:02:49.160> he<00:02:50.160> won't

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
away from people and hopefully he won't

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:56.930 
away from people and hopefully he won't
get<00:02:50.940> anywhere<00:02:51.300> near<00:02:51.360> people<00:02:53.930> here
