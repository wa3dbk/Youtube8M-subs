00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
into the bottom section here so the

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.200 
into the bottom section here so the
bottom<00:01:31.950> couple<00:01:32.280> inches<00:01:32.430> is<00:01:32.700> actually<00:01:33.030> not

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
bottom couple inches is actually not

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.969 
bottom couple inches is actually not
wood<00:01:33.570> I<00:01:33.869> don't<00:01:34.290> know<00:01:34.350> if<00:01:34.439> you<00:01:34.530> can<00:01:34.619> tell<00:01:34.799> in<00:01:34.890> the

it's completely rotted in there because

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:05.649 
it's completely rotted in there because
water<00:02:03.350> has<00:02:03.440> sat<00:02:03.890> there<00:02:04.159> its<00:02:04.700> wycked<00:02:05.060> up<00:02:05.270> into

water has sat there its wycked up into
the<00:02:05.750> bottom<00:02:06.140> and<00:02:06.590> grain<00:02:07.280> of<00:02:07.520> that<00:02:07.850> time<00:02:08.149> jam

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:08.600 
the bottom and grain of that time jam

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.419 
the bottom and grain of that time jam
and<00:02:08.929> totally<00:02:09.470> robbed<00:02:09.679> those<00:02:09.860> out<00:02:10.130> in<00:02:10.340> this

00:02:10.419 --> 00:02:10.429 
and totally robbed those out in this

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:12.910 
and totally robbed those out in this
case<00:02:10.640> we'll<00:02:10.850> have<00:02:10.880> no<00:02:11.180> problems<00:02:11.600> with<00:02:11.720> that<00:02:11.920> so

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
case we'll have no problems with that so

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.380 
case we'll have no problems with that so
I<00:02:12.950> highly<00:02:13.370> recommend<00:02:13.400> when<00:02:14.000> you're<00:02:14.090> when

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850 
you're talking about exterior doors look

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:18.520 
you're talking about exterior doors look
at<00:02:16.970> fiberglass<00:02:17.480> instead<00:02:17.930> of<00:02:18.020> metal<00:02:18.320> if<00:02:18.410> you're

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:18.530 
at fiberglass instead of metal if you're

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.260 
at fiberglass instead of metal if you're
gonna<00:02:18.620> do<00:02:18.770> a<00:02:18.800> smooth<00:02:19.130> door<00:02:19.430> like<00:02:19.670> this<00:02:19.820> one<00:02:20.060> and

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:20.270 
gonna do a smooth door like this one and

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
this jamb safer jamb is really worth the

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:26.710 
this jamb safer jamb is really worth the
upgrade<00:02:25.670> it's<00:02:26.150> not<00:02:26.300> a<00:02:26.330> very<00:02:26.540> expensive

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:26.720
