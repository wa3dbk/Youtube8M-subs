00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
what to release in the sets and that's

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.589 
what to release in the sets and that's
when<00:02:43.859> we<00:02:43.950> started<00:02:44.189> getting<00:02:44.280> TCG<00:02:44.909> exclusives

00:02:45.589 --> 00:02:45.599 
when we started getting TCG exclusives

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:47.899 
when we started getting TCG exclusives
that's<00:02:46.290> when<00:02:46.530> more<00:02:47.040> busted<00:02:47.489> cards<00:02:47.730> started

00:02:47.899 --> 00:02:47.909 
that's when more busted cards started

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:50.509 
that's when more busted cards started
coming<00:02:48.269> back<00:02:48.299> out<00:02:48.659> and<00:02:48.959> that's<00:02:49.500> when<00:02:49.709> you<00:02:50.400> know

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:50.519 
coming back out and that's when you know

coming back out and that's when you know
players<00:02:51.030> started<00:02:51.359> buying<00:02:51.510> a<00:02:51.629> lot<00:02:51.780> more<00:02:51.900> packs

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:52.230 
players started buying a lot more packs

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:53.599 
players started buying a lot more packs
because<00:02:52.469> those<00:02:52.799> cards<00:02:53.099> were<00:02:53.189> harder<00:02:53.430> to<00:02:53.489> get

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:53.609 
because those cards were harder to get

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:54.800 
because those cards were harder to get
because<00:02:53.760> they're<00:02:53.909> probably<00:02:54.120> secret<00:02:54.599> rares

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
because they're probably secret rares

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.990 
because they're probably secret rares
