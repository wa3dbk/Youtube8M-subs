a<00:00:18.990> small<00:00:19.529> little<00:00:20.359> counter<00:00:21.359> that's<00:00:21.510> off<00:00:21.720> to<00:00:21.869> the

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990 
a small little counter that's off to the

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.900 
a small little counter that's off to the
side<00:00:22.230> which<00:00:22.560> is<00:00:22.590> a<00:00:22.710> live<00:00:23.010> edge<00:00:23.220> piece<00:00:23.609> of<00:00:23.789> boob

side which is a live edge piece of boob
Inga<00:00:24.320> which<00:00:25.320> I've<00:00:25.640> put<00:00:26.930> two<00:00:27.930> to<00:00:28.080> three<00:00:28.260> coats

00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:28.529

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
of my oil varnish mix on it which helps

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:33.200 
of my oil varnish mix on it which helps
seal<00:00:31.439> the<00:00:31.590> wood<00:00:31.769> and<00:00:32.040> I<00:00:32.640> don't<00:00:32.700> have<00:00:32.940> any<00:00:33.090> air

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:33.210 
seal the wood and I don't have any air

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:34.760 
seal the wood and I don't have any air
bubbles<00:00:33.630> coming<00:00:33.870> through<00:00:34.079> the<00:00:34.170> wood<00:00:34.350> once<00:00:34.620> I

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
bubbles coming through the wood once I

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.830 
bubbles coming through the wood once I
put<00:00:34.950> the<00:00:35.010> finish<00:00:35.280> on<00:00:35.430> I'm<00:00:36.090> using<00:00:36.300> the<00:00:36.570> mirror

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
put the finish on I'm using the mirror

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.430 
put the finish on I'm using the mirror
coat<00:00:37.790> two-part<00:00:38.790> epoxy<00:00:38.910> which<00:00:39.780> is<00:00:39.960> a<00:00:39.989> two<00:00:40.290> to

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440 
coat two-part epoxy which is a two to

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.130 
coat two-part epoxy which is a two to
one<00:00:40.469> ratio<00:00:41.030> mixture<00:00:42.030> which<00:00:42.750> what<00:00:43.050> I

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:43.140 
one ratio mixture which what I

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:45.170 
one ratio mixture which what I
understand<00:00:43.620> is<00:00:43.770> a<00:00:43.800> stronger<00:00:44.399> type<00:00:44.700> of<00:00:44.850> epoxy

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
understand is a stronger type of epoxy

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.650 
understand is a stronger type of epoxy
compared<00:00:45.780> to<00:00:46.020> or<00:00:46.770> one-to-one<00:00:47.219> mixture<00:00:47.789> so

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
compared to or one-to-one mixture so

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:51.590 
compared to or one-to-one mixture so
I've<00:00:48.809> just<00:00:48.840> mixed<00:00:49.289> it<00:00:49.379> up<00:00:49.500> in<00:00:49.680> my<00:00:50.600> measuring

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
I've just mixed it up in my measuring

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.760 
I've just mixed it up in my measuring
Bowl<00:00:51.809> and<00:00:52.079> I'm<00:00:52.320> now<00:00:52.739> pouring<00:00:53.340> it<00:00:53.430> on<00:00:54.680> to<00:00:55.680> the

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
Bowl and I'm now pouring it on to the

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.930 
Bowl and I'm now pouring it on to the
piece<00:00:55.949> of<00:00:55.980> wood<00:00:58.430> leveling<00:00:59.430> your<00:00:59.579> piece<00:00:59.789> of

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
piece of wood leveling your piece of

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.630 
piece of wood leveling your piece of
wood<00:01:00.090> is<00:01:00.180> very<00:01:00.420> very<00:01:00.660> important<00:01:01.170> my<00:01:01.980> assembly

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
wood is very very important my assembly

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.570 
wood is very very important my assembly
bench<00:01:02.850> is<00:01:03.239> leveled<00:01:03.750> fairly<00:01:04.140> well<00:01:04.320> although<00:01:05.189> it

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
bench is leveled fairly well although it

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:09.140 
bench is leveled fairly well although it
was<00:01:05.880> slightly<00:01:06.090> off<00:01:06.390> so<00:01:07.159> underneath<00:01:08.159> the<00:01:08.549> Bekaa

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
was slightly off so underneath the Bekaa

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.560 
was slightly off so underneath the Bekaa
piece<00:01:09.570> of<00:01:09.720> wood<00:01:09.869> there<00:01:10.020> you<00:01:10.140> can<00:01:10.290> see<00:01:10.439> about

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:11.570 
piece of wood there you can see about

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:14.840 
piece of wood there you can see about
eight<00:01:12.570> or<00:01:12.780> ten<00:01:13.049> or<00:01:13.229> twelve<00:01:13.590> pieces<00:01:14.369> of<00:01:14.640> paper

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
eight or ten or twelve pieces of paper

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.230 
eight or ten or twelve pieces of paper
just<00:01:15.150> to<00:01:15.450> level<00:01:16.380> out<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:16.830> piece<00:01:16.979> of<00:01:17.189> wood<00:01:17.340> I

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
just to level out the piece of wood I

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:23.810 
just to level out the piece of wood I
found<00:01:19.170> now<00:01:20.299> after<00:01:21.299> using<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:22.259> epoxy

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
found now after using the epoxy

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.609 
found now after using the epoxy
that<00:01:24.820> basically<00:01:25.810> you<00:01:25.990> have<00:01:26.229> to<00:01:26.320> spread<00:01:26.560> it

00:01:26.609 --> 00:01:26.619 
that basically you have to spread it

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:28.319 
that basically you have to spread it
around<00:01:26.799> and<00:01:27.159> wherever<00:01:27.399> you<00:01:27.490> touch<00:01:27.759> it<00:01:27.969> to<00:01:28.149> it

00:01:28.319 --> 00:01:28.329 
around and wherever you touch it to it

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:30.179 
around and wherever you touch it to it
will<00:01:28.479> spread<00:01:28.780> to<00:01:28.840> so<00:01:29.500> I'm<00:01:29.619> just<00:01:29.799> using<00:01:29.979> the

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:30.189 
will spread to so I'm just using the

00:01:30.189 --> 00:01:32.340 
will spread to so I'm just using the
brush<00:01:30.340> here<00:01:30.700> this<00:01:31.240> is<00:01:31.390> a<00:01:31.420> foam<00:01:31.719> brush<00:01:31.899> it's<00:01:32.200> not

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:32.350 
brush here this is a foam brush it's not

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:35.249 
brush here this is a foam brush it's not
actually<00:01:32.770> a<00:01:33.009> brush<00:01:33.490> so<00:01:33.869> it<00:01:34.869> doesn't<00:01:35.170> actually

00:01:35.249 --> 00:01:35.259 
actually a brush so it doesn't actually

00:01:35.259 --> 00:01:38.130 
actually a brush so it doesn't actually
absorb<00:01:35.799> almost<00:01:36.310> any<00:01:36.759> of<00:01:36.969> the<00:01:37.090> finish<00:01:37.450> it<00:01:38.110> just

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:38.140 
absorb almost any of the finish it just

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.950 
absorb almost any of the finish it just
helped<00:01:38.890> push<00:01:39.130> it<00:01:39.280> around<00:01:39.539> I've<00:01:40.539> been<00:01:40.689> told<00:01:40.869> by

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:40.960 
helped push it around I've been told by

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.020 
helped push it around I've been told by
few<00:01:41.229> people<00:01:41.500> you<00:01:41.619> do<00:01:41.860> the<00:01:41.979> plastic<00:01:42.189> scraper<00:01:42.729> as

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.030 
few people you do the plastic scraper as

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:45.449 
few people you do the plastic scraper as
well<00:01:43.299> I<00:01:43.509> honestly<00:01:44.110> thinking<00:01:44.860> about<00:01:45.130> the<00:01:45.219> same

00:01:45.449 --> 00:01:45.459 
well I honestly thinking about the same

00:01:45.459 --> 00:01:48.240 
well I honestly thinking about the same
the<00:01:46.390> same<00:01:46.600> thing<00:01:46.869> with<00:01:47.439> the<00:01:47.560> brush<00:01:47.799> it's<00:01:48.159> a

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.250 
the same thing with the brush it's a

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.389 
the same thing with the brush it's a
little<00:01:48.520> bit<00:01:48.610> better<00:01:48.759> that<00:01:48.880> I<00:01:49.090> can<00:01:49.270> squish<00:01:50.110> it

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
little bit better that I can squish it

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.399 
little bit better that I can squish it
into<00:01:51.399> into<00:01:52.119> the<00:01:52.240> live<00:01:52.420> edge<00:01:52.630> where<00:01:53.049> it's<00:01:53.200> kind

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:53.409 
into into the live edge where it's kind

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:55.289 
into into the live edge where it's kind
of<00:01:53.469> summed<00:01:53.649> up<00:01:53.770> some<00:01:54.009> things<00:01:54.189> baby

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:55.299 
of summed up some things baby

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:57.089 
of summed up some things baby
I<00:01:55.450> have<00:01:55.750> found<00:01:55.959> that<00:01:56.170> you<00:01:56.259> have<00:01:56.500> to<00:01:56.770> need<00:01:56.950> to

00:01:57.089 --> 00:01:57.099 
I have found that you have to need to

00:01:57.099 --> 00:02:01.199 
I have found that you have to need to
touch<00:01:57.280> every<00:01:57.610> part<00:01:59.099> with<00:02:00.099> the<00:02:00.280> actual<00:02:00.610> epoxy

00:02:01.199 --> 00:02:01.209 
touch every part with the actual epoxy

00:02:01.209 --> 00:02:04.499 
touch every part with the actual epoxy
so<00:02:01.959> get<00:02:02.229> a<00:02:02.289> plastic<00:02:02.860> scraper<00:02:03.310> on<00:02:03.759> the<00:02:04.390> edge

00:02:04.499 --> 00:02:04.509 
so get a plastic scraper on the edge

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:06.539 
so get a plastic scraper on the edge
it's<00:02:04.720> going<00:02:04.810> to<00:02:04.929> be<00:02:05.020> kind<00:02:05.319> of<00:02:05.439> hard<00:02:06.069> to<00:02:06.159> do<00:02:06.369> that

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:06.549 
it's going to be kind of hard to do that

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:09.240 
it's going to be kind of hard to do that
I<00:02:06.789> just<00:02:07.360> placed<00:02:07.780> Mike<00:02:07.989> up<00:02:08.200> there<00:02:08.500> just<00:02:08.769> a<00:02:08.950> last

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.250 
I just placed Mike up there just a last

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.140 
I just placed Mike up there just a last
bit<00:02:09.759> of<00:02:09.789> it<00:02:10.030> would<00:02:10.269> would<00:02:10.959> pour<00:02:11.230> out<00:02:12.030> onto<00:02:13.030> the

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
bit of it would would pour out onto the

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.110 
bit of it would would pour out onto the
surface<00:02:13.299> and<00:02:13.660> escape<00:02:14.140> the<00:02:14.620> last<00:02:14.860> of<00:02:15.040> it

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
surface and escape the last of it

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.819 
surface and escape the last of it
this<00:02:16.599> is<00:02:16.720> a<00:02:16.780> fairly<00:02:16.989> simple<00:02:17.290> piece<00:02:17.620> obviously

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:17.829 
this is a fairly simple piece obviously

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:20.220 
this is a fairly simple piece obviously
it's<00:02:18.280> pretty<00:02:18.519> small<00:02:18.849> so<00:02:19.569> in<00:02:19.690> this<00:02:19.780> case<00:02:20.019> you're

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
it's pretty small so in this case you're

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.289 
it's pretty small so in this case you're
only<00:02:20.260> going<00:02:20.560> to<00:02:20.650> see<00:02:20.829> the<00:02:20.980> front<00:02:21.190> edge<00:02:21.489> as<00:02:21.819> well

00:02:22.289 --> 00:02:22.299 
only going to see the front edge as well

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:24.420 
only going to see the front edge as well
as<00:02:22.450> the<00:02:22.540> top<00:02:22.780> and<00:02:23.079> everything<00:02:23.170> else<00:02:23.500> is<00:02:23.739> is

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:24.430 
as the top and everything else is is

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:26.280 
as the top and everything else is is
hidden<00:02:24.849> so<00:02:25.120> I'm<00:02:25.360> really<00:02:25.660> just<00:02:25.750> concerned

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
hidden so I'm really just concerned

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.379 
hidden so I'm really just concerned
about<00:02:26.349> coating<00:02:26.860> the<00:02:27.370> front<00:02:27.640> edge<00:02:27.790> as<00:02:28.030> well<00:02:28.180> as

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:28.389 
about coating the front edge as well as

00:02:28.389 --> 00:02:54.910 
about coating the front edge as well as
the<00:02:28.540> entire<00:02:28.810> top

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.559 

now<00:02:55.920> after<00:02:56.459> about<00:02:56.549> five<00:02:56.849> minutes<00:02:56.879> I've<00:02:57.390> let<00:02:57.540> it

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569 
now after about five minutes I've let it

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:59.809 
now after about five minutes I've let it
spread<00:02:58.019> out<00:02:58.049> level<00:02:58.620> itself<00:02:59.010> and<00:02:59.310> we<00:02:59.430> have<00:02:59.579> some

00:02:59.809 --> 00:02:59.819 
spread out level itself and we have some

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:02.210 
spread out level itself and we have some
air<00:03:00.030> bubbles<00:03:00.450> that<00:03:00.870> will<00:03:01.079> be<00:03:01.620> trapped<00:03:01.860> in<00:03:02.099> the

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
air bubbles that will be trapped in the

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:03.589 
air bubbles that will be trapped in the
finish<00:03:02.519> no<00:03:02.819> matter<00:03:02.849> what<00:03:03.239> you're<00:03:03.390> going<00:03:03.480> to

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:03.599 
finish no matter what you're going to

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:06.170 
finish no matter what you're going to
get<00:03:03.720> that<00:03:03.900> if<00:03:04.110> you<00:03:04.140> pour<00:03:05.069> it<00:03:05.129> on<00:03:05.220> gently<00:03:05.700> move

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:06.180 
get that if you pour it on gently move

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.000 
get that if you pour it on gently move
around<00:03:06.510> gently<00:03:06.870> I'll<00:03:07.379> still<00:03:07.680> have<00:03:07.829> some

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
around gently I'll still have some

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.559 
around gently I'll still have some
bubbles<00:03:08.400> so<00:03:08.489> no<00:03:08.610> matter<00:03:08.819> what<00:03:09.060> you'll<00:03:09.299> get

00:03:09.559 --> 00:03:09.569 
bubbles so no matter what you'll get

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:11.780 
bubbles so no matter what you'll get
doing<00:03:09.930> this<00:03:10.049> step<00:03:10.370> luckily<00:03:11.370> it's<00:03:11.519> a<00:03:11.610> very

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790 
doing this step luckily it's a very

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:13.970 
doing this step luckily it's a very
simple<00:03:12.209> step<00:03:12.450> we<00:03:12.870> just<00:03:13.049> have<00:03:13.170> a<00:03:13.200> propane<00:03:13.650> torch

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
simple step we just have a propane torch

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.460 
simple step we just have a propane torch
that<00:03:14.340> we<00:03:14.489> heat<00:03:15.420> the<00:03:15.569> surface<00:03:15.750> very<00:03:16.200> lightly

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
that we heat the surface very lightly

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.680 
that we heat the surface very lightly
and<00:03:16.799> it<00:03:16.980> expands<00:03:17.730> the<00:03:17.879> air<00:03:18.060> in<00:03:18.209> the<00:03:18.299> bubbles

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:18.690 
and it expands the air in the bubbles

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:21.259 
and it expands the air in the bubbles
and<00:03:18.840> pop<00:03:19.079> they<00:03:19.709> go<00:03:19.890> away<00:03:20.010> I<00:03:20.430> basically<00:03:20.909> do<00:03:21.180> this

00:03:21.259 --> 00:03:21.269 
and pop they go away I basically do this

00:03:21.269 --> 00:03:24.050 
and pop they go away I basically do this
to<00:03:21.540> the<00:03:21.629> entire<00:03:21.750> piece<00:03:22.140> looking<00:03:22.590> at<00:03:22.739> it<00:03:23.060> very

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:24.060 
to the entire piece looking at it very

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.399 
to the entire piece looking at it very
closely<00:03:24.349> keeping<00:03:25.349> the<00:03:25.470> flame<00:03:25.769> moving<00:03:27.409> you

00:03:28.399 --> 00:03:28.409 
closely keeping the flame moving you

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:30.080 
closely keeping the flame moving you
can't<00:03:28.650> heat<00:03:28.859> it<00:03:28.890> up<00:03:29.069> a<00:03:29.220> fair<00:03:29.430> bit<00:03:29.609> in<00:03:29.640> certain

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:30.090 
can't heat it up a fair bit in certain

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:32.780 
can't heat it up a fair bit in certain
spots<00:03:30.329> but<00:03:30.690> I<00:03:30.959> would<00:03:31.379> still<00:03:31.590> keep<00:03:31.980> the<00:03:32.190> flame

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:32.790 
spots but I would still keep the flame

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:37.129 
spots but I would still keep the flame
moving<00:03:33.209> around<00:03:33.450> and<00:03:35.000> the<00:03:36.000> warmer<00:03:36.389> the<00:03:36.659> epoxy

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:37.139 
moving around and the warmer the epoxy

00:03:37.139 --> 00:03:39.140 
moving around and the warmer the epoxy
gets<00:03:37.349> it<00:03:37.709> actually<00:03:38.280> gets<00:03:38.730> a<00:03:38.819> little<00:03:39.030> bit

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
gets it actually gets a little bit

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.300 
gets it actually gets a little bit
thinner<00:03:39.450> so<00:03:39.870> we'll<00:03:40.230> actually<00:03:40.409> run<00:03:40.950> a<00:03:40.980> little

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:41.310 
thinner so we'll actually run a little

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.360 
thinner so we'll actually run a little
bit<00:03:41.549> better<00:03:41.730> so<00:03:42.690> if<00:03:43.200> for<00:03:43.500> some<00:03:43.530> reason<00:03:43.980> you

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
bit better so if for some reason you

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.369 
bit better so if for some reason you
have<00:03:44.519> a<00:03:44.549> piece<00:03:44.819> and<00:03:45.150> painting<00:03:45.840> it<00:03:45.989> to<00:03:46.139> spread

00:03:46.369 --> 00:03:46.379 
have a piece and painting it to spread

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:49.009 
have a piece and painting it to spread
it<00:03:46.560> a<00:03:46.680> bit<00:03:46.829> more<00:03:47.069> or<00:03:47.599> maybe<00:03:48.599> move<00:03:48.780> a<00:03:48.810> little

00:03:49.009 --> 00:03:49.019 
it a bit more or maybe move a little

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:52.009 
it a bit more or maybe move a little
quicker<00:03:50.180> either<00:03:51.180> the<00:03:51.510> hotter<00:03:51.810> of<00:03:51.959> the

00:03:52.009 --> 00:03:52.019 
quicker either the hotter of the

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:53.599 
quicker either the hotter of the
environment<00:03:52.530> or<00:03:52.680> if<00:03:52.739> you're<00:03:52.889> using<00:03:53.190> a<00:03:53.370> torch

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:53.609 
environment or if you're using a torch

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:56.000 
environment or if you're using a torch
to<00:03:53.909> let<00:03:54.090> the<00:03:54.239> surface<00:03:54.989> it'll<00:03:55.409> it'll<00:03:55.920> actually

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:56.010 
to let the surface it'll it'll actually

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:58.580 
to let the surface it'll it'll actually
help<00:03:56.310> spread<00:03:57.180> the<00:03:57.329> finish<00:03:57.599> as<00:03:57.750> well<00:03:57.930> but<00:03:58.500> in

00:03:58.580 --> 00:03:58.590 
help spread the finish as well but in

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.110 
help spread the finish as well but in
this<00:03:58.620> case<00:03:58.859> I'm<00:03:59.040> just<00:03:59.099> using<00:03:59.280> it<00:03:59.519> to<00:03:59.609> pop<00:03:59.819> the

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
this case I'm just using it to pop the

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:02.180 
this case I'm just using it to pop the
pop<00:04:00.510> all<00:04:00.720> the<00:04:00.750> bubbles<00:04:00.989> it's<00:04:01.620> a<00:04:01.650> very<00:04:01.829> small

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
pop all the bubbles it's a very small

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:29.930 
pop all the bubbles it's a very small
piece<00:04:02.430> so<00:04:03.269> it's<00:04:03.540> a<00:04:03.720> pretty<00:04:03.930> simple<00:04:04.169> operation

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:29.940 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:32.730 

so<00:04:30.940> here<00:04:31.180> we<00:04:31.300> are<00:04:31.330> it's<00:04:31.660> all<00:04:31.870> settled<00:04:32.230> out<00:04:32.500> now

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:32.740 
so here we are it's all settled out now

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:34.680 
so here we are it's all settled out now
you<00:04:33.040> got<00:04:33.190> to<00:04:33.310> wait<00:04:33.430> about<00:04:33.550> 12<00:04:33.970> hours<00:04:34.150> before

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:34.690 
you got to wait about 12 hours before

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:36.840 
you got to wait about 12 hours before
you<00:04:34.750> actually<00:04:35.320> move<00:04:35.500> the<00:04:35.650> piece<00:04:35.889> and<00:04:36.790> I

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:36.850 
you actually move the piece and I

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:39.540 
you actually move the piece and I
believe<00:04:37.060> it<00:04:37.210> has<00:04:37.330> a<00:04:37.360> full<00:04:37.690> cure<00:04:37.990> time<00:04:38.230> of<00:04:38.560> I

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:39.550 
believe it has a full cure time of I

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:42.330 
believe it has a full cure time of I
would<00:04:40.270> say<00:04:40.419> about<00:04:40.630> a<00:04:40.690> week<00:04:41.190> some<00:04:42.190> of<00:04:42.280> the

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:42.340 
would say about a week some of the
