00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:07.919
 all 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:09.499
 8 this saturday 

00:00:09.499 --> 00:00:13.169
 hello hello hello his own schools is at the bottom of the pros the 

00:00:13.169 --> 00:00:14.770
 neighborhoods around the goal 

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:18.320
 to alençon deceiving 2nd db the technique thing thing thing due like 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.550
 we say by us and for once in the water we will you the machine 

00:00:22.819 --> 00:00:25.599
 in general it happens when we play we will not repeat of course that 

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:28.849
 fifa 10 sites edited by the columnists could not link sport that 

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:30.630
 will come out the produce 

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:31.880
 there are three 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:35.309
 garcia no this one feels it needs it's an audience and it's available on to 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.400
 just about every console of the midi 

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:41.500
 see the ones that exist not even luxury and on mobile mobile situation get 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.500
 mobilize because on iphone 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.210
 that's what we're going to see we're going to talk about what everything started in 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.320
 asserting that a little match had made with thomas and there he will show us at 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.290
 level of checks made from fifa 10th I always said that scoring a goal 

00:00:55.290 --> 00:00:59.440
 no no no no no hello do not understand trends these procedures 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.050
 you recover true vocation for example a day yes it is 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.420
 automatic about issues like how it can not carry forward 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.030
 pressure shifts yes 

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.160
 I can not wait to show a big novelty here site mode 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.350
 workout done thierry who was often from france getting married what's 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.860
 what you say then the mans departure is playable they were partly 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:19.370
 in this list 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:21.270
 so who needs it 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:24.490
 I showed my little pony the attempts to workout 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:27.150
 absolutely then it launches into the arena 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.240
 we are investigating 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:31.600
 he presses the select button and their moms the menu of the same party 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.050
 which opens for one dollar against 6 15% currently a corner 

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:38.300
 we have a training that characterizes the training match so we have 

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:43.160
 started to allow to play capcom 3 will have of this name finally what constitutes 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.680
 a rampart hervé pied a competition between spouses with them non players 

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.670
 with little chasubles for a year how to train properly done 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.970
 know m working situation more consistent with what we have for example of 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:54.290
 contract it was necessary to manage 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.810
 package the implementation of a workout you are even if he and 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.810
 then then ugta reform exactly alas 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.770
 here is the big novelty of this mode c here the scion of the set pieces 

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:06.810
 who then who is who 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.920
 and any essential free kick shot from the back by a single responsible 

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.860
 on the feet I had just what is a desk was the reverse urss in 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.860
 insisting on a corner on a stadacona balloon penalty is stopped ah yes and 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:20.180
 when that's what we call the war and angers we did it to you 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:21.639
 before that remy then in motion 

00:02:21.639 --> 00:02:24.889
 but in fact it's May 16th it's an important point because in 6 to 9 

00:02:24.889 --> 00:02:26.879
 one of the rare flaws of the game 

00:02:26.879 --> 00:02:30.309
 % as well as the whole question of this player who is still well done 

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:32.059
 who defends himself anyway 

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:35.059
 and therefore the need to show that you can set your own karate stroke 

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:37.370
 and that's what we can then 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:39.269
 play in match exactly 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:42.189
 others who has the opportunity to no longer see a competitor percent have 

00:02:42.189 --> 00:02:45.180
 actually skewed the region when we go to the regions 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.920
 leg to the extreme it's still so that's why 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.540
 and then we can choose so for free kicks in the direction of the returns 2 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.439
 good repair space 

00:02:53.439 --> 00:02:55.320
 and so here we come in this menu 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:58.300
 and when we therefore select that the players down for posterity 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:01.300
 to put players did it that's simple 

00:03:02.479 --> 00:03:07.129
 ask the players to move there it is the other one really lives 

00:03:07.129 --> 00:03:10.799
 passed new course of assignment for sure I confess plisson 

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:13.389
 he called an arrow that makes 

00:03:13.389 --> 00:03:16.259
 short few centimeters although to develop a player of size 

00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:18.559
 normal human being can we do it go even further than what 

00:03:18.559 --> 00:03:19.499
 his meetings 

00:03:19.499 --> 00:03:22.109
 it's this question to tell him about his parents 

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:24.819
 I know nothing about the foot challenge but what we can we can what we can 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:27.109
 do for example this mandate a player here 

00:03:27.109 --> 00:03:28.359
 I had before in action 

00:03:28.359 --> 00:03:29.129
 in the unit 

00:03:29.129 --> 00:03:32.900
 the future will become but well we will put time is good and we must stir the m 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:33.620
 while running 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:34.460
 suddenly 

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:36.020
 it lets take some time 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:39.010
 okay but it's also more expensive canon on the a20 the markups or 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:40.320
 exactly after what it takes 

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.500
 it must be useful and effective the roadway they are fishing type 

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.770
 after the Swedish giant's invasion of training would entail a cost 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:49.940
 hunting at the height of clerval still quite a lot not bad for 

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:52.889
 someone who goes from behind is here in everyone 

00:03:52.889 --> 00:03:55.679
 wauquiez always complicated it asked me 

00:03:55.679 --> 00:03:56.919
 hold there 

00:03:56.919 --> 00:04:00.459
 so bravo I'm not certain efficiency in the 100 way to do 

00:04:00.459 --> 00:04:03.259
 to get to that we could question the question the 

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:07.039
 big question will be asked the war cattoir that moves m the balloon will bind the 

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:10.260
 look that will sing in kenya the wall in front of piles of people who will move 

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.439
 they will do to move a lot more the wind have logically 

00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:16.170
 that all its angles so if I want I can come in 

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:17.749
 when once this one 

00:04:17.749 --> 00:04:20.899
 ok ok it's not from the first to the sixth minute where he wants to play the 

00:04:20.899 --> 00:04:22.490
 ball right in 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:24.970
 by taking everyone short of actually the side demands of 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:29.300
 climb but once on the ground a peugeot deal not limited to 1 or 2 

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.360
 the player who car because we can move his equipment supplier on 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.220
 mandanda exactly after the risk is that no one's blanket and 

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:37.820
 include counterattack badly as well handle that 

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:40.090
 so it allows to have a real tactical management on the free kick the 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:41.189
 contest 

00:04:41.189 --> 00:04:44.149
 white laurent is not going to see it but in fact match but there are nine days that 

00:04:44.149 --> 00:04:47.139
 come hand to indicate to his teammates there is ie in fact 

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:50.689
 the alfa-beta tactic an agreement so i'll you want 

00:04:50.689 --> 00:04:54.229
 and percent by the fisc through a touch of a button during the match 

00:04:54.229 --> 00:04:57.529
 e the day after the exam will ask players in the country in any 

00:04:57.529 --> 00:05:01.250
 the island he launched a small spades spike previously created in 

00:05:01.249 --> 00:05:01.960
 training 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.909
 ok it is he who is really nice 

00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:07.269
 can we create more head 

00:05:07.839 --> 00:05:10.219
 will not be saved several 

00:05:10.219 --> 00:05:11.110
 a lot a lot 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:13.949
 for ten than several cards 

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:17.979
 mikati but what is so league 2 which is largely enough I think because 

00:05:17.979 --> 00:05:20.059
 that in the background you can suddenly players 

00:05:20.059 --> 00:05:23.419
 this complaint said that if I have I think not against it but I want it 

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:26.699
 that he likes provocation I still feel a little bit so there completely 

00:05:26.699 --> 00:05:29.499
 in this I raise my hand he moves 

00:05:29.499 --> 00:05:31.150
 and around you get up 

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:34.439
 peyrestortes oracle it was serious 

00:05:34.439 --> 00:05:38.280
 this is it must be for homeless who will be green only knows how to fly 

00:05:38.279 --> 00:05:41.469
 his pages from the first shot kilari seraphim who travels the universe 

00:05:41.469 --> 00:05:45.529
 little synthe for example and that it exists now because 

00:05:45.529 --> 00:05:49.019
 in e1 entremont professional it's going like that it's me to honor 

00:05:49.019 --> 00:05:53.469
 repetition repetition petition this helmet we find the right formula in 

00:05:53.469 --> 00:05:54.869
 the blue cult series 

00:05:54.869 --> 00:05:57.959
 I believe in fact but ireland where they were held in 

00:05:57.959 --> 00:05:58.400
 Libya 

00:05:58.400 --> 00:05:59.669
 ali tounsi 

00:05:59.669 --> 00:06:02.930
 yes yes just moved into the valley of the senses why so the 

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:05.559
 group I can perfectly shot at 1 6% 

00:06:05.559 --> 00:06:07.770
 all world moves and then actually I hold 

00:06:07.770 --> 00:06:10.419
 it serves to grenoble while my side 

00:06:10.419 --> 00:06:13.669
 everyone is for nothing this pole the beauty of the gesture 

00:06:13.669 --> 00:06:15.659
 so wisely marisol 

00:06:15.659 --> 00:06:19.969
 So this for you this morning what made me shine I heard a candidate 

00:06:19.969 --> 00:06:22.539
 presented at the train station when a woman is really something that 

00:06:22.539 --> 00:06:24.369
 is important the player claims more than 40 years 

00:06:24.369 --> 00:06:25.330
 because it's true that 

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:28.659
 this is a simulation week a chips simulation at 08 and then 

00:06:28.659 --> 00:06:32.050
 simulation redit realism and the lack of training it's damaging 

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:33.119
 continuation 

00:06:33.119 --> 00:06:35.659
 and percent so it's still super good idea especially that that in 

00:06:35.659 --> 00:06:36.220
 more 

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:37.780
 it's something 

00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:41.010
 being able to ask each player to make a move 

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:43.259
 particular on a stopped kick 

00:06:43.259 --> 00:06:45.999
 it's my classic training all happy to make free kicks 

00:06:45.999 --> 00:06:48.880
 and corners of the penaltys what is it really created 

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:50.130
 that's why tactical 

00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:52.199
 and it helps especially useful online 

00:06:52.199 --> 00:06:55.310
 when% and when you play against liliane there is always a way a 

00:06:55.309 --> 00:06:59.370
 Elephant test that similar woerth after a moment necessarily to that 

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:01.349
 depends on the minister but in addition you play 

00:07:01.349 --> 00:07:04.539
 but finally when you're enough% to 314 in legend after a while while 

00:07:04.539 --> 00:07:05.619
 begins to know and everything and everything 

00:07:05.619 --> 00:07:09.119
 on the other hand she does not always have players draw in a very 

00:07:09.119 --> 00:07:10.169
 different there is 

00:07:10.169 --> 00:07:13.770
 and you can the last ones finally because coolio prepare to react 

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:16.360
 at one point there is attack is not like you attacks in a way 

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:17.319
 different 

00:07:17.319 --> 00:07:20.159
 you know well and know that it is much more varied than 

00:07:20.159 --> 00:07:22.589
 of the game it's clear it's a lot more varied all the kicks stopped 

00:07:22.589 --> 00:07:25.680
 which was enough for those little newsstands to the damage 

00:07:26.439 --> 00:07:29.219
 in high-loire of what happened it is rather it is rather a good 

00:07:29.219 --> 00:07:31.530
 pick and this is something that really scares connoisseurs 

00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:32.760
 still in particular 

00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:36.380
 ap one is obliged to spend a clinical trial there estimating% 

00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:38.680
 came tacitly laurent paquin who can 

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:41.509
 but it's true that for the stable this moment to pass 

00:07:41.509 --> 00:07:44.849
 awesome does it connect you to summon you in another video in progress 

00:07:45.770 --> 00:07:49.350
 why not right to go see and maybe we range to 36 years 

00:07:50.619 --> 00:07:54.999
 two places thomas should score a goal as well with the success of the simple system 

00:07:54.999 --> 00:07:57.479
 you will know by clicking in a place again we told you 

00:07:57.479 --> 00:08:01.699
 we tell you again we leave you alone it was thomas machines 

00:08:01.699 --> 00:08:03.099
 sir laugh 

00:08:03.099 --> 00:08:05.509
 I tried since I understood 

00:08:05.509 --> 00:08:08.830
 so there you have explained well also other side I understand nothing these 

00:08:08.830 --> 00:08:12.550
 most trendy balloons admiring really it's very soon thiossane 

00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:13.430
 all his allies
