that<00:01:01.350> was<00:01:01.469> set<00:01:01.620> back<00:01:01.770> in<00:01:01.969> 1973<00:01:02.969> I<00:01:03.239> don't<00:01:03.480> think

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
that was set back in 1973 I don't think

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.810 
that was set back in 1973 I don't think
we'll<00:01:03.750> break<00:01:03.989> it<00:01:04.199> will<00:01:04.619> be<00:01:04.769> close<00:01:05.189> by<00:01:05.489> a<00:01:05.519> few

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:07.490 
we'll break it will be close by a few
degrees<00:01:05.939> but<00:01:06.510> I<00:01:06.750> think<00:01:07.110> with<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.290> wind

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
degrees but I think with the wind

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.530 
degrees but I think with the wind
staying<00:01:07.860> up<00:01:08.100> overnight<00:01:08.400> it's<00:01:08.970> very<00:01:09.270> unlikely

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
staying up overnight it's very unlikely

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.120 
staying up overnight it's very unlikely
that<00:01:09.689> we'll<00:01:09.900> break<00:01:10.170> any<00:01:10.320> record<00:01:10.680> lows<00:01:10.860> tonight

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
that we'll break any record lows tonight

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.890 
that we'll break any record lows tonight
