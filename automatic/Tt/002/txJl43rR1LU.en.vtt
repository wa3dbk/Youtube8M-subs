player you suck I don't understand why

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:34.999 
player you suck I don't understand why
that<00:04:33.630> happens<00:04:34.050> and<00:04:34.169> I<00:04:34.259> don't<00:04:34.470> understand<00:04:34.889> why

that happens and I don't understand why

00:04:35.009 --> 00:04:37.129 
that happens and I don't understand why
it<00:04:35.070> still<00:04:35.550> happens<00:04:36.030> to<00:04:36.180> be<00:04:36.270> perfectly<00:04:36.660> honest

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:37.139 
it still happens to be perfectly honest

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:40.999 
it still happens to be perfectly honest

00:04:40.999 --> 00:04:41.009 
because it's it's completely irrational

00:04:41.009 --> 00:04:43.279 
because it's it's completely irrational
it's<00:04:41.880> completely<00:04:42.419> irrational<00:04:42.630> first<00:04:43.080> of<00:04:43.199> all

00:04:43.279 --> 00:04:43.289 
it's completely irrational first of all

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:45.680 
it's completely irrational first of all
from<00:04:43.440> the<00:04:43.530> standpoint<00:04:43.830> of<00:04:44.190> if<00:04:44.490> we<00:04:44.970> are<00:04:45.120> if<00:04:45.539> we

00:04:47.540 --> 00:04:47.550 
are to band together as a consumer base

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:50.930 
are to band together as a consumer base
why<00:04:48.449> would<00:04:48.780> we<00:04:48.960> show<00:04:49.280> favoritism<00:04:50.280> to<00:04:50.639> one

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:50.940 
why would we show favoritism to one

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:53.510 
why would we show favoritism to one
product<00:04:51.449> over<00:04:51.840> another<00:04:52.199> that<00:04:52.620> removes<00:04:53.160> any

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:12.240 
yeah battlefield and call of duty if you

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:13.969 
yeah battlefield and call of duty if you
like<00:05:12.449> battlefield<00:05:13.020> more<00:05:13.259> than<00:05:13.440> call<00:05:13.590> of<00:05:13.620> duty

00:05:13.969 --> 00:05:13.979 
like battlefield more than call of duty

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:16.909 
like battlefield more than call of duty
that's<00:05:14.160> fine<00:05:14.550> if<00:05:15.360> you<00:05:15.599> like<00:05:15.870> Call<00:05:16.500> of<00:05:16.530> Duty

00:05:16.909 --> 00:05:16.919 
that's fine if you like Call of Duty

00:05:16.919 --> 00:05:19.360 
that's fine if you like Call of Duty
more<00:05:17.099> than<00:05:17.250> battlefield<00:05:17.729> that's<00:05:18.120> also<00:05:18.690> fine

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:19.370 
more than battlefield that's also fine

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:21.890 
more than battlefield that's also fine
but<00:05:20.370> I<00:05:20.610> think<00:05:20.880> there's<00:05:21.030> a<00:05:21.090> large<00:05:21.360> contingent

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:21.900 
but I think there's a large contingent

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:23.930 
but I think there's a large contingent
of<00:05:21.960> people<00:05:22.349> that<00:05:22.680> that<00:05:22.949> would<00:05:23.099> normally<00:05:23.340> like

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:23.940 
of people that that would normally like

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:26.629 
of people that that would normally like
to<00:05:23.970> play<00:05:24.389> both<00:05:24.780> battlefield<00:05:25.740> and<00:05:26.039> call<00:05:26.490> of

00:05:26.629 --> 00:05:26.639 
to play both battlefield and call of

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:29.150 
to play both battlefield and call of
duty<00:05:26.940> but<00:05:27.720> they<00:05:27.840> don't<00:05:28.110> admit<00:05:28.320> as<00:05:28.680> much<00:05:28.710> and

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:29.160 
duty but they don't admit as much and

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:30.980 
duty but they don't admit as much and
they<00:05:29.400> they<00:05:29.669> in<00:05:29.820> fact<00:05:30.030> to<00:05:30.210> go<00:05:30.330> the<00:05:30.509> opposite<00:05:30.930> way

00:05:30.980 --> 00:05:30.990 
they they in fact to go the opposite way
