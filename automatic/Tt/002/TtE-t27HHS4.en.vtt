00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:11.600

 colom in 20% thinner than slim 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:09.150
 and it weighs very little 

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:12.019
 at least 30% less than going to slim 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.019
 very light 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:17.030
 I'm going to take this jealousy away so that 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.030
 see how it opens 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:23.439
