00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
guys but the computer is actually a very

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.660 
guys but the computer is actually a very
large<00:00:33.630> contraption<00:00:34.500> that<00:00:34.530> does<00:00:34.920> a<00:00:34.950> lot<00:00:35.070> of

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
large contraption that does a lot of

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:38.030 
large contraption that does a lot of
things<00:00:36.149> it's<00:00:36.510> not<00:00:36.780> all<00:00:36.989> on<00:00:37.020> the<00:00:37.320> outside<00:00:37.710> it's

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
on the inside too so let's say there's

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.810 
on the inside too so let's say there's
somebody<00:00:40.469> in<00:00:40.620> your<00:00:40.800> life<00:00:40.829> that's<00:00:41.250> actually

all<00:00:52.949> the<00:00:53.250> things<00:00:53.600> about<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.780> computer<00:00:55.320> this

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
all the things about the computer this

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:57.740 
all the things about the computer this
is<00:00:55.530> cool<00:00:56.070> at<00:00:56.489> first<00:00:56.520> because<00:00:57.270> you're<00:00:57.570> like

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
is cool at first because you're like

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.010

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
yeah I am really good at the computer

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.950 
yeah I am really good at the computer
and<00:01:01.050> then<00:01:01.379> it<00:01:01.710> becomes<00:01:02.129> really<00:01:02.670> really<00:01:03.510> crappy

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
and then it becomes really really crappy

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.380 
and then it becomes really really crappy

yourself that has to do with the

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.289 
yourself that has to do with the
computer<00:01:09.450> my<00:01:09.600> mom<00:01:09.810> often<00:01:10.320> asks<00:01:11.159> me<00:01:11.430> if<00:01:11.729> I<00:01:12.060> can

the abilities that I provide what I'm
learning<00:01:41.700> more<00:01:42.060> often<00:01:42.479> than<00:01:42.689> then<00:01:43.290> the
