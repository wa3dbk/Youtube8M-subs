00:00:57.649 --> 00:00:57.659 
clump we're going to tie it down at the

00:00:57.659 --> 00:01:01.069 
clump we're going to tie it down at the
tail

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.290 

secur<00:01:01.710> down<00:01:01.949> good<00:01:02.190> site<00:01:02.460> and<00:01:03.059> then<00:01:03.149> we're

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
secur down good site and then we're

actually<00:01:03.449> going<00:01:03.809> to<00:01:04.129> adjust<00:01:05.129> the<00:01:05.369> length<00:01:05.640> of

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
actually going to adjust the length of

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.740 
actually going to adjust the length of
that<00:01:06.259> when<00:01:07.259> we<00:01:07.350> finish<00:01:07.710> the<00:01:07.860> flat<00:01:08.360> okay<00:01:09.360> so<00:01:09.420> the

that when we finish the flat okay so the

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.160 
that when we finish the flat okay so the
next<00:01:09.930> thing<00:01:10.080> we'll<00:01:10.350> do<00:01:10.530> is<00:01:11.600> tie<00:01:12.600> in<00:01:12.659> a<00:01:12.899> little

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
next thing we'll do is tie in a little

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.420 
next thing we'll do is tie in a little
rib<00:01:13.409> using<00:01:14.340> silver<00:01:14.670> wire<00:01:15.860> silver<00:01:16.860> seems<00:01:17.159> to

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
rib using silver wire silver seems to

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.560 
rib using silver wire silver seems to
show<00:01:17.700> up<00:01:19.340> just<00:01:20.340> show<00:01:20.549> up<00:01:20.729> pretty<00:01:20.970> well<00:01:21.090> in<00:01:21.450> the

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
show up just show up pretty well in the

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.120 
show up just show up pretty well in the
water<00:01:21.840> kind<00:01:22.200> of<00:01:22.320> reflects<00:01:22.799> off<00:01:23.070> of<00:01:23.100> the

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:25.130 
water kind of reflects off of the

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:31.260 
water kind of reflects off of the
natural<00:01:26.420> color<00:01:27.420> of<00:01:27.630> the<00:01:27.689> water

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:31.270 

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:33.620 

and<00:01:31.360> then<00:01:31.990> we're<00:01:32.170> going<00:01:32.260> to<00:01:32.320> tie<00:01:32.590> in<00:01:32.920> some

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:33.630 
and then we're going to tie in some

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.530 
and then we're going to tie in some
peacock<00:01:34.630> curl<00:01:35.670> and<00:01:36.670> I'm<00:01:37.000> actually<00:01:37.180> going<00:01:37.479> to

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:37.540 
peacock curl and I'm actually going to

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:42.469 
peacock curl and I'm actually going to
use<00:01:37.840> quite<00:01:38.799> a<00:01:38.830> few<00:01:39.040> strands<00:01:39.520> to<00:01:39.970> tie<00:01:40.210> this

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.410 

I<00:01:42.510> think<00:01:42.930> I've<00:01:43.080> got

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.600 

we've<00:01:45.810> got<00:01:45.960> five<00:01:46.260> different<00:01:46.470> strands

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:48.610 
we've got five different strands

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:54.440 
we've got five different strands
a<00:01:48.640> peacock<00:01:49.360> curl<00:01:50.730> tie<00:01:51.730> that<00:01:51.940> in<00:01:52.210> it

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.539 

at<00:01:54.930> the<00:01:55.170> tail<00:01:55.409> and<00:01:55.439> then<00:01:55.770> bring<00:01:56.040> your<00:01:56.070> thread

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
at the tail and then bring your thread

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:01.249 
at the tail and then bring your thread
all<00:01:57.210> the<00:01:57.270> way<00:01:57.509> up<00:01:57.689> to<00:01:58.759> right<00:01:59.759> behind<00:02:00.030> the<00:02:00.330> right

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
all the way up to right behind the right

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:04.219 
all the way up to right behind the right
behind<00:02:01.530> the<00:02:01.680> beach

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.190 

and<00:02:04.619> we<00:02:04.740> can<00:02:04.890> go<00:02:05.070> ahead

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:08.200 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:17.440 

they're<00:02:08.740> too<00:02:08.950> aggressive<00:02:09.690> roll<00:02:10.690> forward

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:17.450 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.540 

end<00:02:17.990> up<00:02:18.110> behind<00:02:18.350> the<00:02:18.590> beads<00:02:18.800> area<00:02:19.250> so<00:02:19.430> that's

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:19.550 
end up behind the beads area so that's

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:21.339 
end up behind the beads area so that's
it

00:02:21.339 --> 00:02:21.349 
it

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:26.260 
it
so<00:02:21.799> you<00:02:21.920> didn't<00:02:22.249> go<00:02:22.370> anywhere

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:26.270 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:31.510 

and<00:02:26.480> then<00:02:26.810> reverse<00:02:27.590> rap<00:02:28.160> the<00:02:28.490> rib<00:02:29.560> is<00:02:30.560> rap<00:02:31.310> it's

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:31.520 
and then reverse rap the rib is rap it's

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:37.250 
and then reverse rap the rib is rap it's
the<00:02:31.610> opposite<00:02:32.060> direction<00:02:32.180> which<00:02:32.690> here<00:02:33.100> at<00:02:34.100> the

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:37.260 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.960 

at<00:02:37.769> all

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:50.550 

that's<00:02:42.240> fine<00:02:42.510> I

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:50.560 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:56.930 

and<00:02:50.680> wit<00:02:51.190> finished<00:02:51.640> behind<00:02:52.000> the<00:02:52.180> bead

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:56.940 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.130 

and<00:02:57.180> last<00:02:57.990> thing<00:02:58.170> we'll<00:02:58.350> do<00:02:58.560> is<00:03:00.020> want<00:03:01.020> to

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
and last thing we'll do is want to

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:03.020 
and last thing we'll do is want to
adjust<00:03:01.530> this<00:03:01.950> tail<00:03:02.220> a<00:03:02.250> little<00:03:02.580> bit<00:03:02.730> and<00:03:02.910> want

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
adjust this tail a little bit and want

adjust this tail a little bit and want
the<00:03:03.150> tail<00:03:03.360> to<00:03:03.570> be<00:03:03.660> probably<00:03:04.610> out<00:03:05.610> as<00:03:05.850> long<00:03:06.180> as

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
the tail to be probably out as long as

the hook is so I'm going to grab it I'm

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:13.010 
the hook is so I'm going to grab it I'm
actually<00:03:09.570> just<00:03:09.840> going<00:03:10.080> to<00:03:11.240> tear<00:03:12.240> it<00:03:12.450> with<00:03:12.750> my

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:13.020 
actually just going to tear it with my

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:16.220 
actually just going to tear it with my
fingers<00:03:14.030> and<00:03:15.030> what<00:03:15.300> that<00:03:15.510> does<00:03:15.720> is<00:03:15.930> it<00:03:16.050> makes

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:16.230 
fingers and what that does is it makes

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.080 
fingers and what that does is it makes
it<00:03:16.380> look<00:03:16.620> makes<00:03:17.040> mihrab<00:03:17.460> look<00:03:17.730> a<00:03:17.820> little<00:03:17.940> more

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:18.090 
it look makes mihrab look a little more

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:21.470 
it look makes mihrab look a little more
natural<00:03:18.150> rather<00:03:18.900> than<00:03:19.200> actually<00:03:19.680> if<00:03:20.490> you<00:03:20.670> try

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
natural rather than actually if you try

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:24.740 
natural rather than actually if you try
to<00:03:21.540> cut<00:03:21.810> it<00:03:21.840> with<00:03:22.020> your<00:03:22.140> scissors<00:03:22.200> so<00:03:23.750> that's

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:24.750 
to cut it with your scissors so that's

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.140 
to cut it with your scissors so that's
all<00:03:24.930> there<00:03:25.050> is<00:03:25.170> to<00:03:25.350> it<00:03:25.470> that's<00:03:25.650> just<00:03:25.710> a<00:03:26.150> easy

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.150 
all there is to it that's just a easy

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.520 
all there is to it that's just a easy
little<00:03:27.360> micro<00:03:28.110> leech<00:03:28.290> great<00:03:28.920> little<00:03:29.160> leg<00:03:29.310> back
