00:00:00.809 --> 00:00:03.809
 Then use 496 yen since the beginning of the war and touch it 

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:07.720
 Please answer in your own and apply 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:09.290
 Well right ago 

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:11.299
 At this point 

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:15.439
 It is accompanied by a rule over the person who I thought as an individual 

00:00:15.939 --> 00:00:18.809
 It will be said that Yamagata will be strict and try to come 

00:00:18.809 --> 00:00:21.809
 How do you see the team atmosphere 

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:24.800
 Very 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:26.849
 Friendly 

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.489
 It is a good team Tanaka has become a good match 

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:32.900
 Batter less than myself 

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:36.040
 Do you think that you are doing well? 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.390
 I was able to 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:40.969
 That was serious but it's formal 

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:43.500
 I found it open enough 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.390
 That's right Yamada 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.640
 The campsite is not so much crime 

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.620
 I think that Aoyama Reiko 

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.950
 The environment for hiring for the first time is different 

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:57.760
 I think it will be the season after the 17th of this week 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.890
 Do you think that you want to 

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:02.690
 That's right after all 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:05.480
 I'm transferring for the first time 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:07.760
 inside that 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.760
 After all, as an individual 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.960
 As for the outskirts of town this year the goal of goal j1 promotion 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:17.230
 there 

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:19.100
 Just a little more 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.560
 Can I say that I can contribute a lot 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:22.940
 it's here 

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:25.700
 It is motivation in small team play in oneself 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.240
 Isn't it expensive? 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.360
 I agree 

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:29.890
 After all 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.890
 At this point 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:35.130
 I have another one 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.180
 I think that there is also strategic 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.340
 After all 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:41.770
 the town's 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.810
 I think so if I can do it and I can do it. 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.020
 Specifically, I will use my projection vehicle in Kusatsu. 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.760
 Are you happy if you want to 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.670
 Yes, it's the offensive side 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.490
 In minutes 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.200
 Success in Madrid 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.470
 Or the goal will finally come and lead 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:02.740
 In front of the torch relay 

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.810
 I want to see 

00:02:04.810 --> 00:02:07.810
 Do you want the supporters to have another 10,000 at the end 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:11.889
 Everything was dominant 

00:02:11.889 --> 00:02:13.409
 One step height 

00:02:13.409 --> 00:02:15.639
 So far 

00:02:15.639 --> 00:02:16.969
 52 minutes 

00:02:16.969 --> 00:02:20.359
 I'm making a mistake but isk or 

00:02:20.359 --> 00:02:21.459
 It is 1 district 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:24.710
 Yes on the same day I was not able to be overwhelmed 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:26.530
 Message to Special Supporters 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:27.939
 Please 

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:29.280
 Koshien 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.319
 Previous j1 promotion is the goal 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:35.239
 Let's fight themes together 

00:02:35.239 --> 00:02:36.450
 Thank you
