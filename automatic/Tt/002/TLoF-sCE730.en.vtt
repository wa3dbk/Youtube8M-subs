head but I have tips are gonna cut

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.470 
head but I have tips are gonna cut
corners<00:00:16.920> to<00:00:17.220> help<00:00:17.400> you<00:00:17.490> get<00:00:17.699> those<00:00:17.850> waves<00:00:18.150> with

corners to help you get those waves with

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:20.840 
corners to help you get those waves with
a<00:00:18.510> fraction<00:00:18.930> of<00:00:19.050> the<00:00:19.140> time<00:00:19.350> so<00:00:19.980> the<00:00:20.430> first<00:00:20.640> step

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
a fraction of the time so the first step

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.240 
a fraction of the time so the first step
starts<00:00:21.240> night<00:00:21.689> before<00:00:21.869> I<00:00:22.289> take<00:00:22.800> a<00:00:22.830> shower<00:00:23.039> the

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
starts night before I take a shower the

starts night before I take a shower the
night<00:00:23.340> before<00:00:23.519> and<00:00:23.970> I<00:00:24.029> apply<00:00:24.269> a<00:00:24.300> texturising

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
night before and I apply a texturising

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.439 
night before and I apply a texturising
spray<00:00:25.140> to<00:00:25.320> my<00:00:25.650> damp<00:00:25.890> hair<00:00:26.099> this<00:00:26.760> actually<00:00:27.210> cuts

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
spray to my damp hair this actually cuts

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:28.790 
spray to my damp hair this actually cuts
the<00:00:27.539> time<00:00:27.810> and<00:00:27.990> a<00:00:28.019> half<00:00:28.230> because<00:00:28.650> the

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
the time and a half because the

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.589 
the time and a half because the
texturizing<00:00:29.310> spray<00:00:29.580> does<00:00:29.970> the<00:00:30.060> work<00:00:30.210> for<00:00:30.240> you

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:30.599 
texturizing spray does the work for you

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:33.229 
texturizing spray does the work for you
while<00:00:30.779> you<00:00:30.929> sleep<00:00:31.260> so<00:00:31.769> step<00:00:32.040> two<00:00:32.369> my<00:00:33.030> hair

00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:33.239 
while you sleep so step two my hair

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:34.549 
while you sleep so step two my hair
still<00:00:33.450> has<00:00:33.570> some<00:00:33.750> moisture<00:00:34.079> in<00:00:34.260> it<00:00:34.290> from<00:00:34.500> the

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
still has some moisture in it from the

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.979 
still has some moisture in it from the
night<00:00:34.770> before<00:00:34.800> so<00:00:35.790> what<00:00:35.910> I<00:00:35.969> do<00:00:36.120> is<00:00:36.420> I<00:00:36.600> get<00:00:36.690> my

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
night before so what I do is I get my

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.260 
night before so what I do is I get my
blow-dryer<00:00:37.230> I<00:00:37.739> put<00:00:38.129> it<00:00:38.219> on<00:00:38.340> low<00:00:38.550> and<00:00:38.820> I<00:00:39.030> throw

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:39.270 
blow-dryer I put it on low and I throw

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:47.870 
blow-dryer I put it on low and I throw
my<00:00:39.420> head<00:00:39.600> over<00:00:39.840> to<00:00:40.079> get<00:00:40.230> that<00:00:40.260> moisture<00:00:40.530> out

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:47.880 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:51.780 

all<00:00:48.880> right<00:00:49.090> so<00:00:49.540> step<00:00:50.140> three<00:00:50.530> this<00:00:51.220> is<00:00:51.430> when<00:00:51.580> you

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:51.790 
all right so step three this is when you

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:54.000 
all right so step three this is when you
bring<00:00:52.000> your<00:00:52.180> styling<00:00:52.600> tool<00:00:52.780> in<00:00:52.930> I<00:00:53.140> like<00:00:53.560> to<00:00:53.740> use

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.010 
bring your styling tool in I like to use

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.000 
bring your styling tool in I like to use
my<00:00:54.580> straightener<00:00:55.180> it<00:00:56.170> works<00:00:56.350> best<00:00:56.650> for<00:00:56.920> the

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.010 
my straightener it works best for the

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.010 
my straightener it works best for the
beachy<00:00:57.310> waves<00:00:57.520> they're<00:00:57.910> not<00:00:58.060> as<00:00:58.270> you<00:00:58.660> know<00:00:58.690> as

00:00:59.010 --> 00:00:59.020 
beachy waves they're not as you know as

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:02.010 
beachy waves they're not as you know as
strong<00:00:59.800> or<00:01:00.160> as<00:01:00.250> bold<00:01:00.850> as<00:01:01.240> using<00:01:01.720> a<00:01:01.780> curling

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:02.020 
strong or as bold as using a curling

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:03.240 
strong or as bold as using a curling
iron<00:01:02.350> with<00:01:02.590> the<00:01:02.620> clasp

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:03.250 
iron with the clasp

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:05.490 
iron with the clasp
so<00:01:03.670> using<00:01:04.030> this<00:01:04.360> actually<00:01:04.809> works<00:01:05.080> better<00:01:05.350> for

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:05.500 
so using this actually works better for

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.120 
so using this actually works better for
me<00:01:05.770> so<00:01:06.580> I<00:01:06.940> start<00:01:07.300> with<00:01:07.479> using<00:01:07.930> you<00:01:08.680> know<00:01:08.830> just

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:09.130 
me so I start with using you know just

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.790 
me so I start with using you know just
random<00:01:09.520> pieces<00:01:10.080> they<00:01:11.080> don't<00:01:11.260> have<00:01:11.350> to<00:01:11.440> be<00:01:11.560> too

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:11.800 
random pieces they don't have to be too

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.680 
random pieces they don't have to be too
big<00:01:12.010> they<00:01:12.220> don't<00:01:12.370> have<00:01:12.460> to<00:01:12.580> be<00:01:12.700> too<00:01:12.910> small<00:01:13.180> this

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:13.690 
big they don't have to be too small this

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:15.420 
big they don't have to be too small this
is<00:01:13.840> actually<00:01:14.229> when<00:01:14.410> you<00:01:14.530> start<00:01:14.590> to<00:01:14.920> get<00:01:15.100> you

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:15.430 
is actually when you start to get you

you're looking for normally if you're

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:21.780 
you're looking for normally if you're
doing<00:01:20.560> this<00:01:20.770> and<00:01:20.979> you<00:01:21.100> want<00:01:21.280> to<00:01:21.340> do<00:01:21.400> your<00:01:21.550> whole

not<00:01:42.369> you<00:01:42.550> doing<00:01:42.820> it<00:01:43.030> super<00:01:43.390> hard<00:01:43.600> I'm<00:01:43.750> not<00:01:43.840> just

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 
not you doing it super hard I'm not just

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:45.180 
not you doing it super hard I'm not just
doing<00:01:44.080> the<00:01:44.380> straighten<00:01:44.770> just<00:01:44.920> all<00:01:45.040> the<00:01:45.130> way

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:45.190 
doing the straighten just all the way

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:47.219 
doing the straighten just all the way
down<00:01:45.369> I'm<00:01:45.940> holding<00:01:46.450> it<00:01:46.509> really<00:01:46.720> loosely<00:01:46.930> and

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:47.229 
down I'm holding it really loosely and

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:48.930 
down I'm holding it really loosely and
I'm<00:01:47.320> just<00:01:47.530> barely<00:01:47.890> touching<00:01:48.340> the<00:01:48.460> ends<00:01:48.729> to

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:48.940 
I'm just barely touching the ends to

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:52.230 
I'm just barely touching the ends to
guide<00:01:49.119> it<00:01:49.270> as<00:01:49.360> it<00:01:49.509> goes<00:01:49.660> down<00:01:49.690> and<00:01:50.909> the<00:01:51.909> easiest

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
guide it as it goes down and the easiest

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.530 
guide it as it goes down and the easiest
way<00:01:52.450> to<00:01:52.479> do<00:01:52.690> that<00:01:52.840> is<00:01:53.909> just<00:01:54.909> holding<00:01:55.150> your<00:01:55.270> hand

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:55.540 
way to do that is just holding your hand

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:57.510 
way to do that is just holding your hand
down<00:01:55.750> like<00:01:55.960> this<00:01:56.140> grab<00:01:56.890> a<00:01:56.920> piece<00:01:57.190> and<00:01:57.430> you

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:57.520 
down like this grab a piece and you

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.700 
down like this grab a piece and you
actually<00:01:57.850> want<00:01:58.210> to<00:01:58.299> twirl<00:01:58.540> backwards<00:01:59.200> and<00:01:59.560> you

00:01:59.700 --> 00:01:59.710 
actually want to twirl backwards and you

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:03.240 
actually want to twirl backwards and you
just<00:01:59.830> go<00:02:00.010> really<00:02:00.310> slow<00:02:00.790> and<00:02:01.740> don't<00:02:02.740> curl<00:02:03.040> too

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:03.250 
just go really slow and don't curl too

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:04.380 
just go really slow and don't curl too
much<00:02:03.430> because<00:02:03.700> and<00:02:03.850> that's<00:02:03.970> when<00:02:04.180> you<00:02:04.270> get

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
much because and that's when you get

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.260 
much because and that's when you get
that<00:02:04.510> harsher<00:02:04.869> coral<00:02:05.760> so<00:02:06.760> you<00:02:06.820> get<00:02:06.970> these<00:02:07.180> a

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
that harsher coral so you get these a

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:10.020 
that harsher coral so you get these a
little<00:02:07.420> bit<00:02:07.479> of<00:02:07.630> a<00:02:07.720> beach<00:02:07.900> wave<00:02:08.140> and<00:02:08.880> you<00:02:09.880> just

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:10.030 
little bit of a beach wave and you just

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:14.030 
little bit of a beach wave and you just
start<00:02:10.239> picking<00:02:10.479> random<00:02:10.929> pieces<00:02:11.200> everywhere

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:14.040 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.440 

so<00:02:15.040> you<00:02:15.130> grab<00:02:15.280> from<00:02:15.489> the<00:02:15.519> front<00:02:15.610> you<00:02:16.060> grab<00:02:16.239> from

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
so you grab from the front you grab from

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.390 
so you grab from the front you grab from
the<00:02:16.480> back<00:02:16.690> and<00:02:17.019> the<00:02:17.380> beauty<00:02:17.620> about<00:02:17.650> this<00:02:18.130> look

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400 
the back and the beauty about this look

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:19.830 
the back and the beauty about this look
is<00:02:18.610> that<00:02:18.670> you<00:02:18.970> don't<00:02:19.120> have<00:02:19.269> to<00:02:19.450> do<00:02:19.570> your<00:02:19.690> whole

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
is that you don't have to do your whole

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.479 
is that you don't have to do your whole
head<00:02:20.019> so<00:02:20.500> you've<00:02:20.620> already<00:02:20.709> done<00:02:20.920> only<00:02:21.130> a<00:02:21.280> few

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:21.489 
head so you've already done only a few

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:22.920 
head so you've already done only a few
pieces<00:02:21.670> and<00:02:22.060> you've<00:02:22.180> already<00:02:22.420> got<00:02:22.660> a<00:02:22.690> little

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
pieces and you've already got a little

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:24.810 
pieces and you've already got a little
bit<00:02:23.049> of<00:02:23.110> a<00:02:23.170> beachy<00:02:23.470> wave<00:02:23.620> so<00:02:24.370> I'll<00:02:24.459> start<00:02:24.730> on

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:24.820 
bit of a beachy wave so I'll start on

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:26.880 
bit of a beachy wave so I'll start on
the<00:02:24.940> other<00:02:25.120> side<00:02:25.420> of<00:02:25.510> my<00:02:25.630> hair<00:02:25.840> this<00:02:26.590> step

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:26.890 
the other side of my hair this step

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:29.850 
the other side of my hair this step
actually<00:02:27.160> only<00:02:27.549> takes<00:02:27.880> about<00:02:28.709> two<00:02:29.709> or<00:02:29.830> three

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
actually only takes about two or three

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.280 
actually only takes about two or three
minutes<00:02:30.190> and<00:02:30.580> it's<00:02:31.360> perfect<00:02:31.810> for<00:02:31.900> the<00:02:32.080> times

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
minutes and it's perfect for the times

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:33.930 
minutes and it's perfect for the times
that<00:02:32.410> you<00:02:32.560> just<00:02:32.590> want<00:02:32.860> to<00:02:32.890> lay<00:02:33.040> in<00:02:33.190> bed<00:02:33.220> and<00:02:33.610> you

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.250

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:55.970 
beachy wave and then I use the

00:02:55.970 --> 00:02:57.400 
beachy wave and then I use the
texturizing<00:02:56.390> spray<00:02:56.660> that<00:02:56.900> I<00:02:56.960> use<00:02:57.140> the<00:02:57.290> night
