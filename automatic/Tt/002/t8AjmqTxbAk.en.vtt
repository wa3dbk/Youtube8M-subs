00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.540
 guys girls all I'm turdies 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.540
 states and this is very serious and we are 

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:10.230
 of the day because we all know that all 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:12.210
 the days there is a mod always always 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.740
 always all hours all hours and 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.660
 tell you that it is a way that has 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.980
 it seemed quite interesting to bring it 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.470
 more than anything because I got up by the 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.119
 tomorrow and know that we have traveled and 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.400
 that does not properly update the page and 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.109
 nothing said after mining the 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:27.510
 overdue and he touched me with this design and 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.369
 this at what time people have 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.980
 lost the head that was added is 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.360
 pretty funny funny and I think 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.350
 what is the floor for later 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.600
 have it worth 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.920
 it's very good you really are I 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:39.420
 I advise to try because he throws me some 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.620
 good laughs since I have a town in 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.180
 which I think to try mod 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.190
 You already know that I am addicted to the villages 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:48.480
 and more if they have villagers so 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:50.460
 we started hop we fall and the character or is 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.199
 simple is a character or you already know the 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.960
 right has no more mystery going on you 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:56.460
 you make some axes as they can be 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:58.590
 these vouchers we are going to make it worth 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.910
 for you to see 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:01.950
 when we have to do because 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:03.610
 they're done 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:05.710
 but here they are 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:07.180
 and what he does is ax shot we're going to 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:09.670
 to be able to throw axes as if they were 

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:11.070
 arrows according is your hand and I'll 

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.500
 spears 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.560
 it does not matter if it's made of wood stone 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:19.650
 diamond gold we can throw axes 

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:22.790
 the correct question is laces what is 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:25.440
 what happens if I'm in this mode 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:27.480
 spears throws and you lose 

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:30.480
 but if you go over it you recover it from 

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:32.490
 agreement does not have any mystery so 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:35.100
 do not worry because it's good 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.230
 how much damage the ax does the ax goes to 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:42.510
 do the damage that the normal ax does 

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:44.960
 it's worth with the hauls 5 4 3 6 6 3 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:44.960
 6 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:52.060
 moraleja go with axes because with the 

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:59.319
 arrows I think two years ago one but 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:02:02.020
 all 34 we go then hey it's not bad 

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:05.020
 I also love it because it bounces you know 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:07.630
 that is, it does not stay, it does not stay stuck 

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.780
 let's say here that it stays stuck but 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.760
 otherwise the day is not any thing 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:15.470
 bounces 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.470
 This is quite successful 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:25.599
 LOL 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:28.720
 he stays as he pleases 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:30.730
 hello I love the wall that tries the 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.430
 This wall does what it wants 

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:35.170
 but hey if he has his faults but what 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:39.900
 what do i tell you 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:39.900

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:46.720
 my mother is very funny according is 

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:49.180
 a rather curious way 

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:50.830
