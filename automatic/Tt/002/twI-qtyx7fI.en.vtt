end of this game and what you want to do

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.300 
end of this game and what you want to do
is<00:03:08.659> keep<00:03:08.870> boosting<00:03:09.169> along<00:03:09.709> or<00:03:10.010> much<00:03:10.159> as

is keep boosting along or much as

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.550 
is keep boosting along or much as
possible<00:03:10.909> be<00:03:11.599> careful<00:03:12.049> though<00:03:12.169> when<00:03:12.349> you<00:03:12.409> get

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:12.560 
possible be careful though when you get

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:13.839 
possible be careful though when you get
when<00:03:12.739> you<00:03:12.829> start<00:03:13.010> seeing<00:03:13.220> the<00:03:13.430> red<00:03:13.549> platform

when you start seeing the red platform

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:16.360 
when you start seeing the red platform
because<00:03:14.419> you<00:03:14.599> may<00:03:14.780> fail<00:03:15.200> if<00:03:15.590> you<00:03:15.769> boost<00:03:16.129> to<00:03:16.280> the

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
because you may fail if you boost to the

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:17.649 
because you may fail if you boost to the
corner<00:03:16.669> of<00:03:16.730> it<00:03:16.879> like<00:03:17.030> this<00:03:17.239> you'll<00:03:17.479> want

00:03:17.649 --> 00:03:17.659 
corner of it like this you'll want

00:03:17.659 --> 00:03:20.619 
corner of it like this you'll want
yourself<00:03:18.019> off<00:03:18.790> but<00:03:19.790> it's<00:03:19.970> five<00:03:20.150> you<00:03:20.389> boost

00:03:20.619 --> 00:03:20.629 
yourself off but it's five you boost

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:24.339 
yourself off but it's five you boost
into<00:03:20.930> the<00:03:21.019> center<00:03:21.379> oh<00:03:22.780> I<00:03:23.780> forgot<00:03:24.049> to<00:03:24.319> mention
