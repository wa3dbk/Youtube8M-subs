know in the comments the picture to me
is<00:00:51.690> fake<00:00:51.930> because<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:52.860> mini<00:00:53.039> map<00:00:53.190> has<00:00:53.430> seven

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
is fake because the mini map has seven

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:55.520 
is fake because the mini map has seven
flags<00:00:54.000> on<00:00:54.270> it<00:00:54.300> and<00:00:54.570> as<00:00:54.690> we<00:00:54.870> know<00:00:54.899> paracel<00:00:55.500> storm

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
flags on it and as we know paracel storm

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.040 
flags on it and as we know paracel storm
only<00:00:56.280> has<00:00:56.430> five<00:00:56.699> but<00:00:57.239> what<00:00:57.420> could<00:00:57.570> be<00:00:57.750> relevant

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
only has five but what could be relevant

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:00.229 
only has five but what could be relevant
is<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.410> position<00:00:58.890> of<00:00:59.250> where<00:00:59.520> he<00:00:59.699> is<00:00:59.879> in<00:01:00.120> the

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
is the position of where he is in the

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.039 
is the position of where he is in the
water<00:01:00.420> just<00:01:01.170> right<00:01:01.500> off<00:01:01.770> the<00:01:02.070> ship<00:01:02.309> and<00:01:03.049> which

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
water just right off the ship and which

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.590 
water just right off the ship and which
could<00:01:04.350> be<00:01:04.500> actually<00:01:05.040> true<00:01:05.369> why<00:01:05.970> I<00:01:06.000> say<00:01:06.330> that<00:01:06.360> is

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
could be actually true why I say that is

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.410 
could be actually true why I say that is
well<00:01:07.229> if<00:01:07.439> you<00:01:07.560> go<00:01:07.680> to<00:01:08.220> this<00:01:08.340> rock<00:01:08.610> just<00:01:08.850> off

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
well if you go to this rock just off

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.719 
well if you go to this rock just off
alpha<00:01:09.990> just<00:01:10.710> directly<00:01:11.130> looking<00:01:11.490> at<00:01:11.610> the

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
alpha just directly looking at the

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:14.179 
alpha just directly looking at the
communications<00:01:12.450> tower<00:01:12.720> and<00:01:13.560> then<00:01:13.710> pan<00:01:13.979> right

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
communications tower and then pan right

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.460 
communications tower and then pan right
to<00:01:14.760> the<00:01:14.909> US<00:01:15.150> bond<00:01:15.509> which<00:01:15.780> obviously<00:01:16.049> is<00:01:16.320> the

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
to the US bond which obviously is the

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.420 
to the US bond which obviously is the
ship<00:01:16.740> you<00:01:17.670> get<00:01:17.880> 600<00:01:18.540> meters<00:01:18.930> you<00:01:19.470> get<00:01:19.650> 10<00:01:19.890> 15

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
ship you get 600 meters you get 10 15

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.100 
ship you get 600 meters you get 10 15
and<00:01:20.729> you<00:01:20.820> also<00:01:21.000> get<00:01:21.270> that<00:01:21.479> bright<00:01:21.659> light<00:01:21.780> on

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
and you also get that bright light on

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.320 
and you also get that bright light on
the<00:01:22.229> topic<00:01:22.590> ship<00:01:22.860> it's<00:01:23.820> probably<00:01:24.150> the<00:01:24.299> best

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
the topic ship it's probably the best
