00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:19.630
 today we are going to make a sandal for 

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:21.430
 Hawaiian party invitation or 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.450
 It can also be for an invitation from 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:26.960
 a baby shower 

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:30.620
 and we are going to cut out in three colors in 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:33.410
 this case rose purple and yellow the 

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:35.810
 first it's made with foami that looks 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:39.630
 wipes, I hope you have it 

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:44.010
 over there but put the normal pink color 

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:47.160
 a strip of the foam and we're going to 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:50.430
 let's cut 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:54.660
 with a knife or a cutter each 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:57.200
 two centimeters to be able to put the 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.200
 ribbon 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.309
 and a little monkey 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:07.880
 first let's paste the two what 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:09.080
 would be the dwelling and the yellow in the 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.420
 way you want it to be the 

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:14.170
 yellow above the dwelling below and the 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:18.230
 pink it 's going we're not going to hit it 

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:21.790
 because we're going to put the first 

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:25.150
 Band-aid we 're going to make 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:27.970
 every two centimeters we will grab 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:31.180
 our our navajita and we are going to 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:35.470
 cut every two centimeters just one 

00:01:31.180 --> 00:01:38.830
 hairline so that you out there 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:42.130
 put the bar they are getting nothing 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:46.630
 rather that cutie nothing else they're going 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:49.600
 putting and stick it to the end with silicone 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:53.149
 or with instant glue and here 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:57.270
 they did that then if we're going to grab 

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:59.969
 our band 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:03.530
 and first we're going to put it to what it is 

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:03.530
 half to know well 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.250
 Y 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.210
 we're going 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.210
 to paste 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:21.440
 below what is the color pink 

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:23.780
 let's hit him from both sides 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:26.510
 since we have stuck it down 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:31.240
 so now we paste the template 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:34.570
 rose to the other two pieces 

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:37.330
 and here we paste it on both sides and 

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:39.940
 we paste what pink is what 

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:41.620
 with the others you can do it from 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:43.750
 several colors in I am putting you 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:46.150
 three but make it up to four if 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:50.160
 you want we are going to grab what 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:54.150
 It was the little tip and we are going to paste it 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:57.780
 if we grab it, we put it silicone or 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:03:02.240
 glue and stick and now if we go 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.240
 to hit the template 

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:11.800
 that's what we're going to do with silicone 

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:14.650
 in this case because I 'm putting 

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:18.460
 foam and the bottom one is like wipes 

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:21.930
 like fabric and so that it sticks well I need 

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:21.930
 make it silicone 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:30.520
 since it is well well pegadito then 

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:33.360
 if we are going to put a bow on the 

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:33.360
 top part 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:43.230
 so that it looks flirtatious 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.230
 but well 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:55.130
 since we have put the hair 

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:58.200
 on your part they can put you 

00:03:55.130 --> 00:04:01.170
 in your invitation 

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:04.500
 here a little picture or like me I do it and 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:07.800
 I put it in the back in the 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:11.670
 part of where does pizza really go there 

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:15.960
 I put the I do the same way of the 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:18.840
 template and it puts you what I put with 

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:21.590
 letters true the name at what time will you 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:26.070
 be like any other invitation 

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:28.380
 I hope you liked this idea and 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:34.070
 if they liked it, pique ya la manita and say 

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:34.070
 I like to see you in another video bay 

00:04:41.969 --> 00:04:44.029
