00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.420 
what I think of as the secret ingredient
in<00:03:12.430> this<00:03:12.550> soup<00:03:12.850> one<00:03:13.420> red<00:03:13.750> radish<00:03:14.290> just<00:03:15.280> that

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
in this soup one red radish just that

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:17.490 
in this soup one red radish just that
little<00:03:15.850> bit<00:03:16.000> of<00:03:16.030> radish<00:03:16.330> is<00:03:16.720> going<00:03:17.230> to<00:03:17.320> give<00:03:17.470> a

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:17.500 
little bit of radish is going to give a

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.100 
little bit of radish is going to give a
delightful<00:03:18.160> pungency<00:03:18.550> to<00:03:18.850> the<00:03:18.940> soup<00:03:19.180> I'll<00:03:19.960> go

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:20.110 
delightful pungency to the soup I'll go

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:29.880 
delightful pungency to the soup I'll go
ahead<00:03:20.230> and<00:03:20.470> slice<00:03:20.710> it<00:03:20.920> up<00:03:28.620> next<00:03:29.620> I'll<00:03:29.709> add<00:03:29.860> a

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:29.890 
ahead and slice it up next I'll add a

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:32.400 
ahead and slice it up next I'll add a
little<00:03:30.100> bit<00:03:30.220> of<00:03:30.370> olive<00:03:30.610> oil<00:03:30.910> the<00:03:31.600> only<00:03:31.930> fat<00:03:32.200> in

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:32.410 
little bit of olive oil the only fat in

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:34.199 
little bit of olive oil the only fat in
this<00:03:32.590> soup<00:03:32.890> is<00:03:33.070> just<00:03:33.370> a<00:03:33.520> teaspoon<00:03:34.000> and<00:03:34.120> a<00:03:34.180> half

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:34.209 
this soup is just a teaspoon and a half

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:36.540 
this soup is just a teaspoon and a half
of<00:03:34.660> olive<00:03:34.930> oil<00:03:35.050> for<00:03:35.200> two<00:03:35.500> servings<00:03:35.980> so<00:03:36.190> it's

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:36.550 
of olive oil for two servings so it's

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:46.500 
of olive oil for two servings so it's
pretty<00:03:36.820> low<00:03:37.000> in<00:03:37.030> fat<00:03:37.390> and<00:03:44.790> I'll<00:03:45.790> season<00:03:46.060> up<00:03:46.330> the

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:46.510 
pretty low in fat and I'll season up the

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:53.300 
pretty low in fat and I'll season up the
soup<00:03:46.720> with<00:03:46.900> a<00:03:46.930> little<00:03:47.230> bit<00:03:47.320> of<00:03:47.350> lime<00:03:47.650> juice<00:03:47.980> a

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:53.310 

00:03:53.310 --> 00:04:01.840 

little<00:03:54.310> bit<00:03:54.400> of<00:03:54.489> salt

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:01.850 

00:04:01.850 --> 00:04:09.100 

and<00:04:01.940> some<00:04:02.120> fresh<00:04:02.330> ground<00:04:02.360> pepper<00:04:02.660> and<00:04:08.110> we'll

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:09.110 
and some fresh ground pepper and we'll

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:21.760 
and some fresh ground pepper and we'll
go<00:04:09.230> ahead<00:04:09.350> and<00:04:09.500> blend<00:04:20.170> now<00:04:21.170> I<00:04:21.200> don't<00:04:21.320> want<00:04:21.709> to

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:21.770 
go ahead and blend now I don't want to

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:24.040 
go ahead and blend now I don't want to
over<00:04:22.250> blend<00:04:22.400> this<00:04:22.610> mixture<00:04:23.030> because<00:04:23.570> tomatoes

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:24.050 
over blend this mixture because tomatoes

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:25.720 
over blend this mixture because tomatoes
can<00:04:24.260> get<00:04:24.410> a<00:04:24.440> little<00:04:24.620> bit<00:04:24.800> foamy<00:04:25.130> if<00:04:25.370> you<00:04:25.490> blend

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:25.730 
can get a little bit foamy if you blend

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:27.970 
can get a little bit foamy if you blend
them<00:04:25.850> too<00:04:26.090> long<00:04:26.270> so<00:04:27.050> I'll<00:04:27.260> just<00:04:27.590> blend<00:04:27.800> it

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:27.980 
them too long so I'll just blend it

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:29.830 
them too long so I'll just blend it
enough<00:04:28.250> so<00:04:28.520> that<00:04:28.550> it's<00:04:28.820> smooth<00:04:29.180> with<00:04:29.540> still<00:04:29.810> a

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:29.840 
enough so that it's smooth with still a

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:43.000 
enough so that it's smooth with still a
little<00:04:30.200> bit<00:04:30.380> of<00:04:30.470> texture<00:04:41.200> now<00:04:42.200> for<00:04:42.470> a<00:04:42.500> bit<00:04:42.740> more

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:43.010 
little bit of texture now for a bit more

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:45.190 
little bit of texture now for a bit more
texture<00:04:43.610> I'm<00:04:43.790> going<00:04:44.240> to<00:04:44.360> add<00:04:44.510> a<00:04:44.540> mixture<00:04:45.080> of
