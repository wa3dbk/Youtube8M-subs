2000<00:00:36.950> we<00:00:37.950> decided<00:00:38.400> to<00:00:38.489> look<00:00:38.610> at<00:00:38.700> a<00:00:38.760> British

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:39.180 
2000 we decided to look at a British

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:40.610 
2000 we decided to look at a British
crew<00:00:39.420> rather<00:00:39.690> than<00:00:39.960> directly<00:00:40.410> at<00:00:40.500> the

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
crew rather than directly at the

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.560 
crew rather than directly at the
submariners<00:00:41.399> onboard<00:00:41.760> the<00:00:41.880> cursed<00:00:42.120> who<00:00:42.360> died

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.720 
submariners onboard the cursed who died
and<00:00:43.320> I<00:00:43.380> think<00:00:43.560> the<00:00:43.649> reason<00:00:44.040> for<00:00:44.070> doing<00:00:44.310> that<00:00:44.460> is

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
and I think the reason for doing that is

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.819 
and I think the reason for doing that is
the<00:00:45.420> more<00:00:45.600> we<00:00:45.750> looked<00:00:45.960> at<00:00:46.109> what<00:00:46.289> submariners

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
the more we looked at what submariners

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.590 
the more we looked at what submariners
have<00:00:46.920> to<00:00:47.190> do<00:00:47.370> to<00:00:47.760> get<00:00:47.910> through<00:00:48.090> their<00:00:48.239> working

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
day when things go well we decided it

one of the greatest challenges we had
with<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.479> set<00:01:36.689> design<00:01:36.990> was<00:01:37.140> how<00:01:37.259> to<00:01:37.290> convey

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
with the set design was how to convey

in working all the time we were

on and from my projects I've been been
on<00:02:38.459> submarines<00:02:38.880> beset<00:02:39.299> it's<00:02:39.810> fantastic<00:02:40.739> and<00:02:41.010> I

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:41.100 
on submarines beset it's fantastic and I

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
know for a fact for extra bands would be

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.289 
know for a fact for extra bands would be
to<00:02:43.440> see<00:02:43.590> the<00:02:43.620> play<00:02:43.890> evolve<00:02:44.880> walked<00:02:45.150> away

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:45.299 
to see the play evolve walked away

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:55.729

of the comedy and the tragedy we can

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.640
