 dinner without some of zapallo salad 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:24.940
 lentils and bread are not these two 

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:25.869
 things but good the quantities also 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:27.490
 they are important 

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:29.260

 Flaxseed type and notice that bread 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:44.530
 integral has a the order of appearance 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:48.399
 is the gold that does not stick in wheat flour 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:50.640
 and wheat flour is always not 

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:50.640

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:25.959
 steak a steak and with salad and here 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:29.590

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:53.870
 that's day 5 is a diet that you're going to 

00:02:51.409 --> 00:02:56.540
 lose 7 kilos in just five days is 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:03:00.769
 hypocaloric low calorie here is 

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:02.269
 outside the rice the pasta the bread and good 

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:03.170
 everything that has carbohydrates 

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:04.909
 in general 

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:06.920
 so here we are going to go down a lot and 

00:03:04.909 --> 00:03:08.360
 also the idea is that we keep this 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.110
 food system that is what I do in 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.400
 All this 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:11.720
 this what I put but sometimes 

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.790
 add a yogurt or add some 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.859
 dairy the friend do not go down learn 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:18.200
 as the healthiest too and they will give you 

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:23.000
 eager to maintain a balanced diet and 

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:25.129
 balance all this is not an authority 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.230
 to say that it effectively already does 

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:28.129
 diets thank you very much already simple that you 

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:31.209

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:31.209
 the diet
