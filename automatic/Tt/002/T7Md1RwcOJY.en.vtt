are all going in this direction so if

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.930 
are all going in this direction so if
anybody<00:02:39.110> was<00:02:39.320> to<00:02:39.380> swipe<00:02:39.920> at<00:02:40.100> your<00:02:40.310> head<00:02:40.610> which

don't get into a fight if you're wearing
clip-on<00:02:43.880> bags<00:02:44.209> but<00:02:45.140> anyway<00:02:45.560> the<00:02:46.130> clips<00:02:46.430> are

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
clip-on bags but anyway the clips are

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.240 
clip-on bags but anyway the clips are
going<00:02:46.970> in<00:02:47.120> the<00:02:47.239> same<00:02:47.420> direction<00:02:48.040> they<00:02:49.040> could

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:49.250 
going in the same direction they could

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:51.550 
going in the same direction they could
come<00:02:49.430> off<00:02:49.640> what<00:02:50.120> I<00:02:50.150> don't<00:02:50.420> understand<00:02:51.019> is<00:02:51.170> why

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560 
come off what I don't understand is why

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:54.910 
come off what I don't understand is why
didn't<00:02:51.860> they<00:02:52.040> make<00:02:53.000> the<00:02:53.209> clips<00:02:53.510> go<00:02:53.750> in<00:02:54.019> one<00:02:54.260> one

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:54.920 
didn't they make the clips go in one one

00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:57.850 
didn't they make the clips go in one one
direction<00:02:55.459> one<00:02:55.670> way<00:02:55.880> and<00:02:56.239> then<00:02:57.019> at<00:02:57.230> the<00:02:57.380> top<00:02:57.410> go

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:57.860 
direction one way and then at the top go

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:00.670 
direction one way and then at the top go
another<00:02:58.100> direction<00:02:58.340> kind<00:02:59.090> of<00:02:59.150> like<00:02:59.360> how<00:02:59.680> the

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680 
another direction kind of like how the

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:03.940 
another direction kind of like how the
Jessica<00:03:01.250> Simpson<00:03:01.280> bangs<00:03:01.880> are<00:03:02.769> anyway<00:03:03.769> these

Jessica Simpson bangs are anyway these

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:07.780 
Jessica Simpson bangs are anyway these
are<00:03:04.010> human<00:03:04.400> hair<00:03:04.670> so<00:03:05.680> you<00:03:06.680> can<00:03:06.890> dye<00:03:07.070> them<00:03:07.370> and

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
are human hair so you can dye them and

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:11.229 
are human hair so you can dye them and
curl<00:03:08.090> it<00:03:09.070> you<00:03:10.070> know<00:03:10.190> the<00:03:10.340> quality<00:03:10.580> of<00:03:10.850> hair<00:03:11.150> is

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:11.239 
curl it you know the quality of hair is

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:13.570 
curl it you know the quality of hair is
pretty<00:03:11.420> good<00:03:11.720> there's<00:03:11.959> minimal<00:03:12.320> shedding<00:03:13.040> it

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:13.580 
pretty good there's minimal shedding it

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:16.900 
pretty good there's minimal shedding it
is<00:03:14.300> very<00:03:14.570> thick<00:03:14.989> though<00:03:15.370> if<00:03:16.370> your<00:03:16.580> hair<00:03:16.880> is

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:16.910 
is very thick though if your hair is

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:21.370 
is very thick though if your hair is
fine<00:03:17.480> um<00:03:19.180> this<00:03:20.180> wouldn't<00:03:20.570> work<00:03:20.600> for<00:03:20.720> you<00:03:21.110> and

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:21.380 
fine um this wouldn't work for you and

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:26.199 
fine um this wouldn't work for you and
also<00:03:21.769> I<00:03:22.280> did<00:03:22.730> put<00:03:23.030> in<00:03:23.230> lighter<00:03:24.230> wisps<00:03:25.040> on<00:03:25.220> the

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 
also I did put in lighter wisps on the

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:29.560 
also I did put in lighter wisps on the
side<00:03:27.040> because<00:03:28.040> I<00:03:28.370> wanted<00:03:28.730> to<00:03:28.790> add<00:03:29.150> highlights

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:29.570 
side because I wanted to add highlights

00:03:29.570 --> 00:03:32.680 
side because I wanted to add highlights
to<00:03:30.049> my<00:03:30.200> hair<00:03:30.470> with<00:03:31.250> the<00:03:31.489> bank<00:03:31.700> so<00:03:32.030> this<00:03:32.330> kind<00:03:32.600> of

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:32.690 
to my hair with the bank so this kind of

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:36.300 
to my hair with the bank so this kind of
gives<00:03:32.959> me<00:03:33.370> highlights<00:03:34.370> as<00:03:34.610> well<00:03:34.820> as<00:03:34.970> a<00:03:35.000> bang<00:03:35.299> so

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.310 
gives me highlights as well as a bang so

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:51.559 
gives me highlights as well as a bang so
to<00:03:37.310> clip<00:03:37.820> it<00:03:37.970> in

00:03:51.559 --> 00:03:51.569 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:54.259 

you<00:03:52.140> can<00:03:52.319> trim<00:03:52.590> it<00:03:52.620> I<00:03:52.980> guess<00:03:53.609> it<00:03:53.790> is<00:03:53.819> sort<00:03:53.969> of

00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:54.269 
you can trim it I guess it is sort of

00:03:54.269 --> 00:04:00.830 
you can trim it I guess it is sort of
meant<00:03:54.510> to<00:03:54.659> be<00:03:54.810> worn<00:03:54.989> as<00:03:55.260> a<00:03:55.290> side<00:03:55.739> bang<00:03:59.840> let's

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
meant to be worn as a side bang let's

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:03.559 
meant to be worn as a side bang let's
see<00:04:00.989> it<00:04:01.139> kind<00:04:01.439> of<00:04:01.560> adds<00:04:01.849> like<00:04:02.849> an<00:04:03.060> instant

00:04:03.559 --> 00:04:03.569 
see it kind of adds like an instant

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:11.820 
see it kind of adds like an instant
highlight<00:04:04.790> just<00:04:05.790> at<00:04:06.030> the<00:04:06.150> front

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:11.830 

00:04:11.830 --> 00:04:15.210 

so<00:04:12.430> if<00:04:12.700> if<00:04:12.970> you<00:04:13.240> have<00:04:13.390> thin<00:04:13.690> hair<00:04:13.720> or<00:04:14.350> the<00:04:14.920> hair

00:04:15.210 --> 00:04:15.220 
so if if you have thin hair or the hair

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:19.080 
so if if you have thin hair or the hair
texture<00:04:15.910> and<00:04:16.180> the<00:04:16.209> hair<00:04:16.959> colored<00:04:18.090> doesn't

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.090 
texture and the hair colored doesn't

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:23.550 
texture and the hair colored doesn't
match<00:04:21.300> you<00:04:22.300> know<00:04:22.420> this<00:04:22.660> doesn't<00:04:22.960> match<00:04:23.260> but<00:04:23.530> I

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:23.560 
match you know this doesn't match but I

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:25.980 
match you know this doesn't match but I
added<00:04:24.040> that<00:04:24.070> but<00:04:24.520> if<00:04:24.760> the<00:04:24.970> bang<00:04:25.210> part<00:04:25.660> doesn't

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:25.990 
added that but if the bang part doesn't

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:28.440 
added that but if the bang part doesn't
match<00:04:26.520> it's<00:04:27.520> going<00:04:27.880> to<00:04:27.940> look<00:04:28.090> like<00:04:28.120> you're

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:28.450 
match it's going to look like you're

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:34.470 
match it's going to look like you're
wearing<00:04:28.600> a<00:04:29.640> toupee<00:04:31.530> but<00:04:32.530> if<00:04:32.740> you<00:04:33.190> if<00:04:33.490> the<00:04:34.210> bank

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:34.480 
wearing a toupee but if you if the bank

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:36.630 
wearing a toupee but if you if the bank
part<00:04:34.870> pretty<00:04:35.230> much<00:04:35.440> matches<00:04:35.740> your<00:04:36.130> color<00:04:36.370> I

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:36.640 
part pretty much matches your color I

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:38.790 
part pretty much matches your color I
think<00:04:37.480> you<00:04:37.600> can<00:04:37.780> get<00:04:37.930> away<00:04:37.960> with<00:04:38.290> it<00:04:38.470> and<00:04:38.680> then

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:38.800 
think you can get away with it and then

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.880 
think you can get away with it and then
you<00:04:38.920> have<00:04:39.040> to<00:04:39.130> kind<00:04:39.340> of<00:04:39.460> smooth<00:04:39.820> it<00:04:40.000> down<00:04:40.890> but

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:41.890 
you have to kind of smooth it down but

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:46.140 
you have to kind of smooth it down but
this<00:04:42.340> is<00:04:42.610> what<00:04:43.150> it<00:04:43.270> looks<00:04:43.450> like<00:04:43.600> on<00:04:43.750> the<00:04:43.900> top<00:04:45.150> if

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:46.150 
this is what it looks like on the top if

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:52.410 
this is what it looks like on the top if
you<00:04:46.630> have<00:04:47.230> a<00:04:47.260> problem<00:04:47.560> blending<00:04:48.280> it<00:04:48.460> I<00:04:51.420> would

00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:52.420 
you have a problem blending it I would

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:54.150 
you have a problem blending it I would
suggest<00:04:52.600> you<00:04:52.870> wear<00:04:53.050> a<00:04:53.110> headband<00:04:53.590> if<00:04:53.800> you<00:04:53.920> think

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:54.160 
suggest you wear a headband if you think

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:59.190 
suggest you wear a headband if you think
it<00:04:55.710> you<00:04:56.710> know<00:04:56.830> doesn't<00:04:57.490> match<00:04:57.820> it<00:04:58.780> kind<00:04:59.080> of

00:04:59.190 --> 00:04:59.200 
it you know doesn't match it kind of

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:03.270 
it you know doesn't match it kind of
hides<00:04:59.440> the<00:04:59.830> scene<00:05:00.160> right<00:05:00.430> there<00:05:01.350> um<00:05:02.350> if<00:05:02.770> you

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:03.280 
hides the scene right there um if you

00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:04.830 
hides the scene right there um if you
have<00:05:03.370> black<00:05:03.610> hair<00:05:03.910> you<00:05:04.090> can<00:05:04.240> wear<00:05:04.420> black

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:04.840 
have black hair you can wear black

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:08.220 
have black hair you can wear black
headband<00:05:05.940> via<00:05:06.940> brown<00:05:07.300> or<00:05:07.540> blonde<00:05:07.780> hair<00:05:08.050> I

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:08.230 
headband via brown or blonde hair I

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:11.610 
headband via brown or blonde hair I
think<00:05:08.440> a<00:05:08.530> tortoiseshell<00:05:09.160> is<00:05:09.700> pretty<00:05:10.620> which

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:11.620 
think a tortoiseshell is pretty which

00:05:11.620 --> 00:05:14.300 
think a tortoiseshell is pretty which
kind<00:05:12.550> of<00:05:12.670> blends<00:05:13.060> with<00:05:13.270> your<00:05:13.480> hair<00:05:13.660> so<00:05:13.990> it's

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:14.310 
kind of blends with your hair so it's

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:20.010 
kind of blends with your hair so it's
you<00:05:15.310> know<00:05:15.430> there's<00:05:15.850> less<00:05:16.120> of<00:05:16.150> a<00:05:16.419> seam<00:05:16.660> there<00:05:19.020> so

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:20.020 
you know there's less of a seam there so

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:23.610 
you know there's less of a seam there so
this<00:05:20.260> is<00:05:20.410> the<00:05:20.530> human<00:05:20.890> hair<00:05:21.070> bang<00:05:21.310> I<00:05:22.500> think<00:05:23.500> it's

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:23.620 
this is the human hair bang I think it's

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:29.550 
this is the human hair bang I think it's
okay<00:05:24.040> um<00:05:25.050> for<00:05:26.050> 1299<00:05:26.650> human<00:05:27.220> hair<00:05:28.110> you<00:05:29.110> know<00:05:29.260> you

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:29.560 
okay um for 1299 human hair you know you

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:31.409 
okay um for 1299 human hair you know you

00:05:31.409 --> 00:05:31.419 
can thin it out a little bit if it's too

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:34.530 
can thin it out a little bit if it's too
thick<00:05:31.720> and<00:05:32.220> you<00:05:33.220> cut<00:05:33.580> it<00:05:33.700> blunt<00:05:34.030> if<00:05:34.210> you<00:05:34.330> like
