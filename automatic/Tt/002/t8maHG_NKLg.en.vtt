 hello world on the pc that we 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:06.000
 except today I'm going to show you 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:09.360
 how to create a minecraft server 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.849
 bakhit version 1.4.5 of minecraft 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:15.299
 while the version of crabs the kit 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.500
 is now out it's not the 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:19.949
 beta version 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:22.170
 this is the full version then in the 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:24.570
 description there is a link first 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.939
 to download the gender point and the 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.760
 second to download the points rhone 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:32.489
 and beats that I offer you for free 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:34.140
 and yes I am very nice so a 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.860
 once you have both files on 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:37.950
 your office 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:41.600
 we will create a new folder but I 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:45.000
 will call him for the server tutorial 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:48.000
 and that's when these facts are going to be 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.850
 on the duchies in the folder we open 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.100
 the folder and we have this one then 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.940
 she was doing the movie see we go 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.090
 right click 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.800
 we make change and then it may be that 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.750
 make you a warning made 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.600
 perform 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:05.939
 after you have a notepad 

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.740
 then there is going to have you do 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:11.010
 really cost 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.380
 moment of the video etc you're really 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:15.360
 carefully to be sure not to 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.549
 it works the first time 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.560
 first thing we let everything see we go 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:23.189
 go to the ponds we want a 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:28.049
 computer in your drive and call 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:30.450
 it's here then for windows pay it 

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:33.960
 not a windows xp was changed there 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:39.450
 I do not explain for vista and 7 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:44.130
 so it's this game of having it program 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:50.280
 files then program then first time 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:52.270
 86 his feet of nothing if you are 32 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.880
 bits you go 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.439
 if you have a 32-bit windows you 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:57.759
 just have a file 

00:01:56.439 --> 00:01:59.770
 program they may be called 

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:03.460
 premium file will be 6 inches 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:05.500
 only program files then if you 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.850
 have both of you going in price in 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.170
 actually they have to go down if 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:10.090
 you're 32 bits you're going to have 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:13.150
 only one of the two you click on 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:15.400
 him who stays is logical then in vo 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:19.629
 in and we'll go down to 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:24.610
 javaux here here now you look 

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:26.709
 if you managed 6 10 gr 7 is beautiful that 

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:30.370
 was doubtful record too but if 

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:33.430
 you keep yourself zoomed 6 and manages 7 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:35.709
 6 had only manage 6 you're going 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.420
 selected but you are going to 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:40.650
 remember that I had managed this 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:45.400
 muse 6 you're going to take gfs is 

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:49.690
 then maugis gr7 I repeat if you have 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:51.700
 managed 6 and gr7 you take gers is so 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:54.819
 you only manage if you 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:58.150
 know I'll succeed then we'll 

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:59.620
 go back in notepad here I have 

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:03.670
 forgot and we go back 

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:06.250
 here case I said you're going to have to 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.720
 the 32 bits or a single choice then the one 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.750
 who wants you going to have you go 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:12.970
 write it here first time 86 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:14.410
 I leave it like that because I have 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:17.049
 am at the top of the topics both then 

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:18.850
 i'm going by default begging files if you 

00:03:17.049 --> 00:03:21.459
 are in the process of beats and then you have 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:23.489
 only one of the two you write one 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:25.750
 who you have here 

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:28.750
 then are your great prices really from 

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:31.530
 meaning in the jt after a small price in 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:35.019
 France we go in java 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:38.859
 if you have managed this recession gers is 

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:41.139
 here you have both gsm squires so 

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:42.639
 runs seven months there is written the ofs I the 

00:03:41.139 --> 00:03:44.800
 repeat because I would have had a lot of 

00:03:42.639 --> 00:03:46.930
 comments following the previous 

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:49.150
 about this step here if you have 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:51.130
 the two giant recipes and I have a v6 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:52.930
 you take gers is you only have 

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:54.910
 I managed this first throw harris 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:58.500
 if you will surely be gers is protected 

00:03:54.910 --> 00:04:01.930
 it's illogical then it is described here 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:04.510
 then it's over so we can 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:07.300
 close that here you 've been charged a 

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:09.210
 point kind we will do click like for 

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:12.250
 fame actually control these 

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:16.260
 returns in notepads here graffiti 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:19.630
 bukit jrabots leaves if a bracket point 

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:23.290
 2:02 to do control for v paste 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:27.700
 the exact name of the point kind then 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:30.430
 that one was registered here 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:34.390
 it is done it is registered fillers 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:38.680
 orane executed and the server is going 

00:04:34.390 --> 00:04:42.100
 run like a handsome boy then 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:43.510
 1.4.5 you saw it in water then the 

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:48.700
 pause maps 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:51.330
 then the world the bundle is den then 

00:04:48.700 --> 00:04:51.330
 we are waiting 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:00.420

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:02.310
 marked with a child born christophe for the 

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:05.070

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:08.430
 did we write that to get in 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:10.380
 we are waiting for it means to press on a 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:12.120
 key to continue press 

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:13.160
 any keyboard key and 

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:15.990
 then that closes 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:18.180
 then you know your server file 

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:20.370
 sicav or clicked on you have you 

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:22.110
