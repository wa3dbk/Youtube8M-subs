school my PhD program all of that just
not<00:00:38.230> have<00:00:38.379> time<00:00:38.680> to<00:00:39.640> think<00:00:39.820> about<00:00:39.969> my<00:00:40.270> edges

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:40.660

however at this point I'm noticing that
it's<00:00:44.410> kind<00:00:44.739> of<00:00:44.829> reverting<00:00:45.310> back<00:00:45.340> because<00:00:45.970> I've

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:46.090 
it's kind of reverting back because I've

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:47.790 
it's kind of reverting back because I've
been<00:00:46.239> doing<00:00:46.480> things<00:00:46.660> that<00:00:46.930> you<00:00:47.290> know<00:00:47.410> I<00:00:47.440> kind
