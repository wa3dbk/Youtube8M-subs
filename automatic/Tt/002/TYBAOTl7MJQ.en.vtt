that<00:05:06.810> originally<00:05:06.990> have<00:05:07.680> this<00:05:08.370> would<00:05:08.550> be<00:05:08.640> way

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:08.760 
that originally have this would be way

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:11.600 
that originally have this would be way
too<00:05:08.790> heavy<00:05:08.940> plus<00:05:09.570> my<00:05:10.230> own<00:05:10.560> wallet<00:05:11.190> it's<00:05:11.370> pretty

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:11.610 
too heavy plus my own wallet it's pretty

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:14.720 
too heavy plus my own wallet it's pretty
heavy<00:05:11.820> also<00:05:12.290> so<00:05:13.290> chadha<00:05:13.650> I<00:05:13.980> mean<00:05:14.220> but<00:05:14.580> the

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:14.730 
heavy also so chadha I mean but the

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:16.190 
heavy also so chadha I mean but the
weight<00:05:14.910> is<00:05:15.030> not<00:05:15.060> everything<00:05:15.510> that's<00:05:15.780> in<00:05:15.960> here

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:16.200 
weight is not everything that's in here

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:17.510 
weight is not everything that's in here
is<00:05:16.230> not<00:05:16.470> a<00:05:16.530> problem<00:05:16.800> for<00:05:16.980> me<00:05:17.160> though<00:05:17.340> even

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:17.520 
is not a problem for me though even

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:20.240 
is not a problem for me though even
though<00:05:17.730> I<00:05:17.760> was<00:05:18.060> pretty<00:05:18.450> heavy<00:05:18.920> but<00:05:19.920> I<00:05:19.950> don't

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:20.250 
though I was pretty heavy but I don't

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:23.930 
though I was pretty heavy but I don't
think<00:05:20.430> it's<00:05:20.640> a<00:05:20.760> problem<00:05:21.060> either<00:05:21.590> because<00:05:22.940> it's

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:23.940 
think it's a problem either because it's

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:26.660 
think it's a problem either because it's
just<00:05:24.650> but<00:05:25.650> yeah<00:05:25.800> um<00:05:26.100> the<00:05:26.370> weight<00:05:26.550> is

00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:26.670 
just but yeah um the weight is

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:28.520 
just but yeah um the weight is
definitely<00:05:26.970> not<00:05:27.060> a<00:05:27.120> problem<00:05:27.450> for<00:05:27.480> me<00:05:27.630> but<00:05:28.260> if

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:28.530 
definitely not a problem for me but if

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:30.140 
definitely not a problem for me but if

more the heavier um but in my opinion I
definitely<00:05:46.140> think<00:05:46.470> that<00:05:46.620> it<00:05:46.980> is<00:05:47.010> worth<00:05:47.490> the

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:47.520 
definitely think that it is worth the

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:50.630 
definitely think that it is worth the
money<00:05:47.820> because<00:05:48.420> the<00:05:48.900> quality<00:05:49.200> is<00:05:49.470> awesome<00:05:49.830> the

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:50.640 
money because the quality is awesome the

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:53.480 
money because the quality is awesome the
leather<00:05:50.970> is<00:05:51.120> really<00:05:51.480> thick<00:05:51.750> and<00:05:52.220> the<00:05:53.220> leather

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:53.490 
leather is really thick and the leather

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:56.480 
leather is really thick and the leather
is<00:05:53.910> different<00:05:54.660> depending<00:05:55.050> on<00:05:55.440> what<00:05:56.010> kind<00:05:56.250> of

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:56.490 
is different depending on what kind of

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:19.530 
and I felt like it wasn't as heavy as

00:06:19.530 --> 00:06:21.470 
and I felt like it wasn't as heavy as
this<00:06:19.710> one<00:06:19.980> but<00:06:20.280> that<00:06:20.700> could<00:06:20.880> just<00:06:20.910> be<00:06:21.210> me<00:06:21.450> but

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:21.480

this one but that could just be me but
the<00:06:21.780> leather<00:06:22.020> was<00:06:22.170> definitely<00:06:22.590> different<00:06:22.770> and

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:23.070 
the leather was definitely different and
