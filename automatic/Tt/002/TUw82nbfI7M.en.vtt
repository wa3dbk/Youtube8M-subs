00:00:35.689 --> 00:00:35.699 
numbers he doesn't eat them so let's

00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:38.450 
numbers he doesn't eat them so let's
give<00:00:35.879> it<00:00:35.969> a<00:00:36.000> try<00:00:36.649> here<00:00:37.649> you<00:00:37.800> can<00:00:37.980> see<00:00:38.160> we<00:00:38.309> have<00:00:38.430> a

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
give it a try here you can see we have a

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.060 
give it a try here you can see we have a
bunch<00:00:38.760> of<00:00:38.879> mms<00:00:39.480> there's<00:00:39.899> not<00:00:40.079> too<00:00:40.320> many<00:00:40.500> but

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
bunch of mms there's not too many but

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.680 
bunch of mms there's not too many but
there<00:00:41.280> is<00:00:41.370> not<00:00:41.550> too<00:00:41.789> few<00:00:42.120> so<00:00:42.390> we<00:00:42.480> need<00:00:42.629> to

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
there is not too few so we need to

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.270 
there is not too few so we need to
figure<00:00:42.870> out<00:00:43.079> how<00:00:43.230> to<00:00:43.289> count<00:00:43.620> them<00:00:43.859> the<00:00:44.129> best

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:44.280 
figure out how to count them the best

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.459 
figure out how to count them the best
way<00:00:44.489> for<00:00:44.699> us<00:00:44.730> to<00:00:44.910> Connor<00:00:45.120> M&amp;Ms<00:00:45.600> is<00:00:45.809> sectioning

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
way for us to Connor M&amp;Ms is sectioning

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.049 
way for us to Connor M&amp;Ms is sectioning
them<00:00:46.590> off<00:00:46.710> we<00:00:47.280> can<00:00:47.460> actually<00:00:47.579> put<00:00:47.820> a<00:00:47.850> box

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
them off we can actually put a box

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.970 
them off we can actually put a box
around<00:00:48.359> some<00:00:48.629> of<00:00:48.660> them<00:00:48.899> and<00:00:49.079> I<00:00:49.469> think<00:00:49.530> Elliot's

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
around some of them and I think Elliot's

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.970 
around some of them and I think Elliot's
got<00:00:50.100> a<00:00:50.160> great<00:00:50.399> plan<00:00:51.109> here<00:00:52.109> you<00:00:52.260> can<00:00:52.410> see<00:00:52.589> Elliot

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
got a great plan here you can see Elliot

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.009 
got a great plan here you can see Elliot
actually<00:00:53.399> put<00:00:53.519> a<00:00:53.550> box<00:00:53.760> around<00:00:53.940> 10<00:00:54.390> M&amp;Ms

00:00:55.009 --> 00:00:55.019 
actually put a box around 10 M&amp;Ms

00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:57.020 
actually put a box around 10 M&amp;Ms
there's<00:00:55.649> 10<00:00:55.890> of<00:00:55.920> them<00:00:56.039> right<00:00:56.219> there<00:00:56.489> that's

there's 10 of them right there that's

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.900 
there's 10 of them right there that's
easy<00:00:57.239> to<00:00:57.390> count<00:00:57.739> since<00:00:58.739> we<00:00:58.949> can<00:00:59.100> see<00:00:59.339> all<00:00:59.550> 10

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
easy to count since we can see all 10

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.150 
let's muscle through this we can figure
this<00:01:51.510> out<00:01:52.020> don't<00:01:52.230> you<00:01:52.440> worry<00:01:52.650> about<00:01:52.770> it<00:01:53.010> and

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:53.160 
this out don't you worry about it and

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.520 
this out don't you worry about it and
we'll<00:01:53.520> get<00:01:53.700> these<00:01:53.880> counted<00:01:54.420> I've<00:01:55.020> decided<00:01:55.380> to

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
we'll get these counted I've decided to

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.830 
we'll get these counted I've decided to
use<00:01:55.620> just<00:01:56.490> two<00:01:56.670> blue<00:01:56.790> M&amp;Ms<00:01:57.150> cuz<00:01:57.360> that's<00:01:57.510> too

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
use just two blue M&amp;Ms cuz that's too

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.930 
use just two blue M&amp;Ms cuz that's too
wide<00:01:57.960> Willie's<00:01:58.350> favorite<00:01:58.890> color<00:01:59.070> so<00:01:59.340> we're

00:01:59.930 --> 00:01:59.940 
wide Willie's favorite color so we're

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:01.580 
wide Willie's favorite color so we're
gonna<00:02:00.030> use<00:02:00.120> a<00:02:00.270> 10<00:02:00.600> frame<00:02:00.870> so<00:02:01.140> we<00:02:01.260> can<00:02:01.410> figure

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
gonna use a 10 frame so we can figure

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.680 
gonna use a 10 frame so we can figure
out<00:02:01.710> how<00:02:01.860> many<00:02:01.920> M&amp;Ms<00:02:02.430> we<00:02:02.550> have<00:02:02.790> and<00:02:03.090> how<00:02:03.510> many

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:03.690 
out how many M&amp;Ms we have and how many

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:06.440 
out how many M&amp;Ms we have and how many
atoms<00:02:03.840> are<00:02:04.140> left<00:02:04.350> over<00:02:04.500> let's<00:02:05.070> go<00:02:05.250> by<00:02:06.120> moving

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
atoms are left over let's go by moving

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.719 
atoms are left over let's go by moving
each<00:02:06.600> M&amp;M<00:02:07.110> into<00:02:07.500> one<00:02:07.650> of<00:02:07.740> the<00:02:07.830> squares<00:02:08.160> I<00:02:08.459> know

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
each M&amp;M into one of the squares I know

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.060 
each M&amp;M into one of the squares I know
that<00:02:09.179> if<00:02:09.269> I<00:02:09.360> fill<00:02:09.660> all<00:02:09.929> those<00:02:10.229> squares<00:02:10.590> I<00:02:10.800> will

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:11.070 
that if I fill all those squares I will

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:13.550 
that if I fill all those squares I will
have<00:02:11.190> 10<00:02:11.550> mm<00:02:12.150> so<00:02:12.720> the<00:02:12.840> only<00:02:12.960> thing<00:02:13.140> I<00:02:13.230> have<00:02:13.380> left

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
have 10 mm so the only thing I have left

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.040 
have 10 mm so the only thing I have left
to<00:02:13.680> do<00:02:13.860> is<00:02:14.070> count<00:02:14.520> the<00:02:14.640> M&amp;Ms<00:02:15.030> left<00:02:15.240> over

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
to do is count the M&amp;Ms left over

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:26.060 
to do is count the M&amp;Ms left over
there's<00:02:16.860> one<00:02:17.750> two<00:02:18.750> three<00:02:19.640> four<00:02:22.700> five<00:02:24.170> six<00:02:25.170> this

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:26.070 
there's one two three four five six this

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:27.410 
there's one two three four five six this
is<00:02:26.220> actually<00:02:26.460> pretty<00:02:26.610> easy<00:02:26.850> I<00:02:26.940> think<00:02:27.180> we<00:02:27.270> have

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
is actually pretty easy I think we have

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.710 
is actually pretty easy I think we have
it

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:27.720 
it

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:31.070 
it
so<00:02:28.380> we've<00:02:28.500> counted<00:02:28.770> ten<00:02:29.310> at<00:02:29.460> the<00:02:29.490> top<00:02:29.790> and<00:02:30.080> six

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
so we've counted ten at the top and six

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.770 
so we've counted ten at the top and six
at<00:02:31.230> the<00:02:31.320> bottom<00:02:31.650> so<00:02:31.890> ten<00:02:32.130> M&amp;Ms<00:02:32.520> up<00:02:32.700> above<00:02:33.030> six

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
at the bottom so ten M&amp;Ms up above six

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.830 
at the bottom so ten M&amp;Ms up above six
M&amp;Ms<00:02:34.320> below<00:02:35.030> that<00:02:36.030> equals<00:02:36.390> a<00:02:36.480> total<00:02:36.630> of

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
M&amp;Ms below that equals a total of

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:37.970 
M&amp;Ms below that equals a total of
sixteen<00:02:37.290> M&amp;Ms

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
sixteen M&amp;Ms

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.690 
sixteen M&amp;Ms
Willie<00:02:38.460> has<00:02:38.790> 16<00:02:39.480> M&amp;Ms<00:02:40.110> he<00:02:40.470> loves<00:02:40.830> blue<00:02:41.250> M&amp;Ms

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
Willie has 16 M&amp;Ms he loves blue M&amp;Ms

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:43.270 
Willie has 16 M&amp;Ms he loves blue M&amp;Ms
he's<00:02:41.970> gonna<00:02:42.120> be<00:02:42.270> so<00:02:42.480> excited

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
he's gonna be so excited

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.770 
he's gonna be so excited
awesome<00:02:44.280> work<00:02:44.460> math<00:02:44.700> friends<00:02:45.270> you<00:02:45.450> helped

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 
awesome work math friends you helped

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.060 
awesome work math friends you helped
