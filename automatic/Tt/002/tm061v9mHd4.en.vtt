00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.270
 and then take over the impasse in video as 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:09.090
 we were here this simulator attention 

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:12.090
 I agree very well here with the 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:14.610
 35 he has here the simulator 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.880
 in this matter of mana 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:21.510
 flag is the following it gives a slight 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.640
 feel on your guitar that you are 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.529
 let's say so because 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.160
 he takes from his guitar the 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:31.679
 frequencies of medium and leaves more acute 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.750
 and serious and you have the feeling that 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:36.200
 It seems that I was on the guitar so I 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.200
 I have here 

00:00:40.429 --> 00:00:43.940
 now the simulator 

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:55.530
 But this is not guitar that gives you 

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:58.230
 a feeling there is the tone here 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.960
 the guitar that would be to the top of the 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:04.860
 guitar on top is the part where it is sÃ´nia 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:10.020
 more at school sin take out malisse tobo 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:12.030
 leave 0 you see difference has more 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:15.170
 sound from inside the guitar is crazy 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.170
 guitar and when you put 

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:20.700
 he has another command here that 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:23.359
 get the board that would be the body 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.359
 size 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:39.880
 and I get that people leave class 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:42.850
 more sequido ready and I have the volume 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:46.210
 This gives you that feeling of the guitar more 

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:48.940
 the idea is that you plug the guitar 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:52.180
 in its true and you have a have a 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:54.100
 different frequency response not 

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:55.990
 have been angry I have guitar 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.640
 I'm going to call you to put a lap on something. 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.830
 so I call the guitar pick up week 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.950
 which accuses the way a little bit 

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:07.450
 body cap frequency and leaves 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:11.640
 beauty, and then you can use the ball and America. 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:14.950
 has a pedal where it gives a feeling 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.000
 Maggie improved fishing nets and seemed 

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:20.080
 we are not guitar 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:22.660
 out here behind it is still a 

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:26.140
 electric circuit you hit it 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:28.420
 transforms your guitar guitar but it is 

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:31.870
 a thing made by a circuit 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:34.720
 specific of the law you do not have this 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:37.510
 supposed simulation that such a sensation 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.940
 that you took the middle is so much if you 

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:42.610
 you get the analogue you get back to 

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.560
 blockade of the controlled drug 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.950
 increases to another service and 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.950
 do not stay 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:55.350
 so it is what takes you so far 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:57.900
 if there is a guitar somewhere here I 

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:00.630
 I can work the fear then I have been 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.130
 only that it is not that in fact this 

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:04.620
 simulation will leave to avoid 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:08.010
 steel guitar retention in the area and takes 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:11.070
 it would be very easy things are not like that 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:13.440
 Of course I'll connect a guitar here in 

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:15.840
 pedal because it is already regularized and 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:20.880
 then the value that we will not leave 

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:22.740
 ready for 21 and it was then that you 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.900
 have doubt about it picks the wrong 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:27.709
 Legs will not even see you 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.709
 so I went
