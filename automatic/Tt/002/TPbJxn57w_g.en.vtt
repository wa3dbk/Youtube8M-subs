00:00:00.059 --> 00:00:04.259
 the box of Pandora Kratos traverses the desert of lost souls and 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.980
 he finds a horn that on touching him would call kronos who on his back 

00:00:07.979 --> 00:00:10.409
 he carried the huge temple of Pandora 

00:00:10.409 --> 00:00:14.489
 once over the titan it takes three days climbing and looking for some 

00:00:14.489 --> 00:00:16.000
 cost by which to climb 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.510
 when he finally finds a place to get to the mainland 

00:00:20.119 --> 00:00:23.039
 Kratos begins his mission by entering the temple 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.779
 but before entering you meet a person 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:27.099
 in fact he was a human 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:28.259
 it was not a god 

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:32.089
 that had been condemned by the gods to burn the bodies of humans that 

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:35.410
 they wanted to enter the temple and get the Pandora's box 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:39.850
 along the way it is killing many magical and mythical beings such as mermaids 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:40.829
 minotaurs 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.969
 cycle fat witnesses in addition to the multiple puzzles you have to 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.100
 arm in order to find and use the Pandora's box 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.350
 in this journey the main story is interspersed 

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:54.420
 from which skeletons trying to find the pandora's box 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.020
 with secondary stories 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:59.100
 like the first human who tried to conquer the box 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.480
 but not having achieved it 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.260
 the gods condemned him to an eternity burning the corpses in a bonfire 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.040
 of those warriors that like him failed in the search 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:11.330
 also on the road kratos is encountering the corpses of 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.800
 those people who looking for maximum power seemed 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:15.580
 at the same time 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.400
 along this journey in the temple of Pandora that is divided in two 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.440
 zones of ring sof pandora the rings of pandora and cliffs of madness 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:24.860
 cliffs of madness 

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.010
 the game also delves into the history of the architect who built 

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:29.720
 this huge mass 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.470
 missing green third 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.450
 this architect was a faithful follower of the gods who accepted the task of 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.160
 build a temple full of traps to house the box 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:40.150
 but nevertheless 

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:41.310
 this architect 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:42.720
 married and with two children 

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.570
 while he was building this temple 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:46.430
 his two sons die 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:48.070
 this fact made him crazy 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:51.580
 and began to move away more and more from loyalty to the gods 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:53.900
 considering the up coles with him 

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:57.740
 however these two deaths do not stop the architect to follow 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.840
 building his masterpiece even using the heads of his children to 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.930
 access certain places of the temple 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.020
 that's why the more you move forward in the madder temple he gets 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.500
 it was coming back and the traps are getting more and more difficult 

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:14.969
 due to the use of the corpses of their children as 

00:02:14.969 --> 00:02:17.840
 tools or keys to go forward in the temple 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.560
 the wife starts a strong conversation with him 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.420
 that ended with her death nailed by a knife and the back 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.259
 suicide of green cats third 

00:02:27.259 --> 00:02:30.819
 when at last Kratos gets Pandora's box and has it in his possession 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:35.849
 being in the city of Athens seeing the great achievement of kratos throws a 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:38.330
 concrete column crossing it and killing it 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.810
 and on his deathbed nightmares and his terrible visions about the past 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.790
 who surrounds him continue to harass him 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.550
 with the memories he had about him as the murder of his family and the 

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:50.219
 guilty of all this 

00:02:50.219 --> 00:02:54.489
 kratos dies and descends to the underworld where before falling could be saved 

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:58.199
 thanks to the old man who ate the island and that he had removed the key from the 

00:02:58.199 --> 00:02:58.829
 captain 

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:02.759
 Seeing it so that we can find the exit avoiding difficulties 

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:04.759
 which he is already used to 

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:06.069
 when there is the exit 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:10.260
 is coming out of a tomb in Athens that a mysterious days before 

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.620
 hermit who had chatted with kratos 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:14.219
 I had been digging 

00:03:14.219 --> 00:03:18.469
 this old man disappears leaving deals with doubts of the identity of such 

00:03:18.469 --> 00:03:19.359
 hermit 

00:03:19.359 --> 00:03:23.539
 that is when Kratos was about to enter again at the destroyed hour 

00:03:23.539 --> 00:03:24.719
 Oracle Temple 

00:03:24.719 --> 00:03:28.119
 knowing that his final battle was there 

00:03:28.119 --> 00:03:29.669
 kratos vs ares 

00:03:29.669 --> 00:03:33.649
 kratos entrance to the temple and went to the back of this which is at 

00:03:33.649 --> 00:03:34.319
 fresh air 

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:38.540
 where previously there was a huge statue with a giant sword 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:39.859
 bridging 

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:42.499
 it is there where he meets the god of war 

00:03:42.499 --> 00:03:44.650
 who was talking to the sky 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:46.499
 criticizing his father zeus 

00:03:46.499 --> 00:03:49.840
 and reproaching him that he was seeing what his son could do 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.120
 how powerful he was and now even more 

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.089
 because Pandora's box now belonged to him 

00:03:55.089 --> 00:03:59.059
 Kratos throws a lightning bolt at the chain that held the Pandora's box that ares 

00:03:59.059 --> 00:04:01.779
 He had in his hand and is about to open it 

00:04:01.779 --> 00:04:03.109
 after a thousand years 

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:07.709
 the box was finally opened and the powers of the gods were unleashed 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:10.049
 Kratos increased enormously in size 

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:12.039
 reaching the height of ares 

00:04:12.039 --> 00:04:15.739
 after a great epic battle ares sends kratos to another dimension 

00:04:16.289 --> 00:04:19.479
 telling him that he took many ways to kill a man 

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:23.069
 but that the best way to kill someone was to break their spirit 

00:04:23.069 --> 00:04:26.689
 that's why kratos falls on a platform where there was only one 

00:04:26.689 --> 00:04:27.190
 temple 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:30.190
 the temple in which previous years he had killed his family 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:34.720
 Kratos does not understand much open the door of the temple and see that inside the 

00:04:34.719 --> 00:04:37.530
 he finds his family being this an illusion 

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:41.490
 but this is where he sees that clones of him are beginning to emerge from the walls 

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:45.419
 a paradox was formed in which deals had to kill these clones 

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:46.210
 his 

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:49.210
 since they wanted to kill their family then 

00:04:49.729 --> 00:04:52.900
 you have to avoid what previous years he had done 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:54.690
 after a difficult fight 

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:58.970
 where clones of kratos grow a lot numerically ares stripped deals of 

00:04:58.970 --> 00:04:59.789
 your swords 

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:01.710
 tearing off his arms 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:04.330
 and with them he kills his family again 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:06.509
 ares makes kratos back to athens 

00:05:06.509 --> 00:05:10.919
 where before they had been fighting and now kratos stripped of their swords and 

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:14.650
 of all hope only awaits the final blow of his enemy 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:18.810
 but that's where he sees the statue with the giant golden sword that simulated a 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:19.289
 bridge 

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:23.199
 so he dodges the blow of his enemy and tears the sword from the statue 

00:05:23.199 --> 00:05:26.270
 thus being planted in a second fight with the god 

00:05:26.270 --> 00:05:28.699
 willing to liquidate him for what he did 

00:05:28.699 --> 00:05:30.310
 after another fight with ares 

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:32.259
 Kratos manages to beat him and ares 

00:05:32.259 --> 00:05:35.719
 lump ford on the water since the fight develops in the sea 

00:05:35.719 --> 00:05:39.610
 he remembers that it was he who saved him from his death but he wanted to get 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:41.599
 ideal land that did not have mercy 

00:05:41.599 --> 00:05:45.229
 but Kratos tells him that he had achieved it and crosses it with the sword 

00:05:45.229 --> 00:05:47.059
 killing him mercilessly 

00:05:47.059 --> 00:05:49.180
 Kratos had achieved the impossible 

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:51.699
 that a mortal kill a god 

00:05:51.699 --> 00:05:54.050
 ares no longer existed 

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:58.330
 the new god of the war kratos to have fulfilled the mandate of atenea 

00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:01.439
 he feels he will be repressed from his feelings of guilt 

00:06:01.439 --> 00:06:02.740
 but when he talks to her 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:06.580
 she tells him that the gods have cried to their fallen brother and that they thank him 

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:07.939
 for doing his homework 

00:06:07.939 --> 00:06:11.649
 but that he would not be stripped of his nightmares that tormented him when 

00:06:11.649 --> 00:06:15.429
 he killed his family since no man and no god would forget the terrible ones 

00:06:15.429 --> 00:06:17.710
 facts that he had committed 

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:21.680
 when he saw that his main objective had not been achieved and that he would live with 

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:25.259
 remorse of not recovering his family for the rest of his days 

00:06:25.259 --> 00:06:28.809
 Kratos does not support the idea and decides to launch from the top of a mountain 

00:06:28.809 --> 00:06:33.180
 on whose precipice cliffs await you that will surely end with your 

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:33.580
 lifetime 

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:36.360
 saying the gods of Olympus have abandoned me 

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:40.729
 now there is no hope but when diving and falling into the water it is 

00:06:40.729 --> 00:06:43.939
 limited by the goddess atenea to the top where it was launched 

00:06:43.939 --> 00:06:48.169
 where there was a statue of her and a mysterious golden hatch and 

00:06:48.169 --> 00:06:50.139
 he says it was not his time to die 

00:06:50.139 --> 00:06:54.169
 and that the gods could not forget the deeds that he managed to beat without any 

00:06:54.169 --> 00:06:55.619
 help from a god i 

00:06:55.619 --> 00:06:57.189
 how ares had died 

00:06:57.189 --> 00:07:00.669
 there was a vacancy among the gods that was to be occupied by him 

00:07:00.669 --> 00:07:04.629
 since there was no god of war it is here where atenea opens the floodgate 

00:07:04.629 --> 00:07:07.990
 golden and reveals its interior the entrance took it to Mount Olympus 

00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:12.530
 the goddess gives her the athenaeous swords that closely resemble the 

00:07:12.530 --> 00:07:16.840
 swords of chaos only that these are golden instead of the others that were 

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:18.369
 forged iron 

00:07:18.369 --> 00:07:20.689
 Kratos was preparing to enter Mount Olympus 

00:07:20.689 --> 00:07:24.879
 entering a room where in the background awaits the majestic throne where finally 

00:07:24.879 --> 00:07:28.439
 he sits down and rests knowing that he has not only achieved the impossible 

00:07:29.009 --> 00:07:30.379
 but he also knew 

00:07:30.379 --> 00:07:32.189
 that he was now the new god of war
