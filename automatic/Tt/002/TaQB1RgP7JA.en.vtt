00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.900
 flight 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.410

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:06.630
 seconds to be able to click on the 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:09.070

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:16.690
 an old plus you do not care 

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.010
 especially not click on it because it 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:19.870
 will have to redo all 

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:21.459
 manipulations you have your feet on 

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:23.560

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:24.730
 downloads so I inform you of 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.860
 real before it's not a download 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:28.900
 it's your browser that is going to 

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:30.400
 turn into a video player and there you 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.090
 will have your movie directly 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.830
 streaming 

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:34.239
 so I remind you better to have 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:35.730
 a wifi connection that 3g 

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:38.470
 because otherwise it will really lagged 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:39.610
 lazer you have your movie so I'm going 

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:48.370
 to show you that we can have is the 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:50.670
 movie no problem I have not really 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.670
 to choose 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:08.050
 to replace will impact the 6h 12h 

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:08.710
 hang on for the sea 

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:11.110
 was 8th 

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:13.270
 she was well into her thirties 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:15.340
 did it well and did 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:16.780
 so here I showed you how 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:18.280
 watch streaming movies 

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:19.900
 so we will try now to 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:21.610
 go back to see the 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:24.120
 series it's the same since I did not 

00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:24.120
 not tested yet 

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:28.900
 so we go back with the 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:31.180
 back from the back of the browser it's 

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:35.380
 very simple so there she is going to the 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:37.140
 serial teeth once in series I'm going 

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:41.260
 look in the first page because 

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:45.610
 I do not know too many series nor are we going 

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:48.070
 take what for example as notes or 

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:55.810
 then as a lot 

00:04:48.070 --> 00:05:00.100
 there is no need you I'm going to take 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:05:05.080
 express express the example i want to see 

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:07.630
 that and 24000 view we can see so here we 

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:10.660
 go see the series card like everything 

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:12.160
 on time it's a bit long as I 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:15.130
 wanted a connection there that started 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:17.670
 with a bit so we do not care a bit about 

00:05:15.130 --> 00:05:19.630
 the fish tank there you have the team 

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:21.580
 a small crowd and there you have 

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:25.630
 mid-season so for example in dhr the 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:28.540
 season one so there I have the names of 

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:33.460
 season imagine game see season 7 

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:37.150
 a family affair that brings me here 

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:39.580
 on business Thursday figure of 

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:41.670
 holland and there your browser is going to 

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:44.290
 turn a video player 

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:46.300
 so that's very handy 

00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:47.950
 fast there really is not much 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:49.270
 to do separately click on the movies 

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:52.630
 when you look at where the series when 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:56.520
 you look at i'm going to visualize kahel 

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:56.520
 a bit the series that lasts 40 minutes 

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:20.370
 so I did not really choose to come from 

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:21.570
 series so that's where were expressed 

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:23.670
 but you can choose what you 

00:06:21.570 --> 00:06:25.640
 want there were several series I 

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:29.910
 believe he had how much 

00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:33.060
 I know exactly where we will see that a 

00:06:29.910 --> 00:06:34.800
 little 7000 series is going rather episode and 

00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:36.660
 2009 wireless so here I hope that 

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:38.580
 the trick has you more power to watch 

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:40.470
 movies or series in streaming and 

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:44.490
 free on all for free and in 

00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:45.680
