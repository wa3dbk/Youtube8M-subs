 it was one of the jobs of the mayordomos 

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:29.000
 is that when it comes to stores to explain how these things work to 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.339
 distance 

00:05:31.339 --> 00:05:33.080

00:05:35.650 --> 00:05:38.650
 uu to be able to thank 

00:05:39.249 --> 00:05:40.659
 it's hard to say 

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:41.949
 with two areas 

00:05:41.949 --> 00:05:43.520

 He also stressed the sentence of this case 

00:05:51.659 --> 00:05:54.339
 let's see if now 

00:05:54.339 --> 00:05:57.339
 in addition the cameras very practical 

00:05:59.559 --> 00:06:01.869
 another sidewalk 

00:06:01.869 --> 00:06:02.740
 thesis 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:08.080
 this the trident the tickets for the shows with internet access 

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:11.080
 varela 

00:06:11.979 --> 00:06:14.830
 each room has two butlers 

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:19.610
 one of morning shift and one of afternoon so we can call them in any 

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:23.569
 time to help us with the luggage or to prepare a bath 

00:06:24.619 --> 00:06:29.460
 many more waterscalientes that felt flowers rose petals 

00:06:29.459 --> 00:06:34.389
 carefully placed and some candles to create truly appetizing atmosphere 

00:06:36.199 --> 00:06:39.139
 and that having a butler has many advantages 

00:06:39.139 --> 00:06:43.159
 for example when you go back to your room to go to sleep you have the 

00:06:43.159 --> 00:06:46.909
 cam accepted the shoes carefully placed on the 

00:06:46.909 --> 00:06:51.399

00:06:55.729 --> 00:06:56.619
 asian 

00:06:56.619 --> 00:06:59.619
 Well, all that is done by stewards 

00:07:01.279 --> 00:07:04.539
 but we should not forget about the cleaning staff 

00:07:04.539 --> 00:07:08.729
 they are indispensable to find us every day the room in 

00:07:08.729 --> 00:07:10.029
 perfect state 

00:07:10.029 --> 00:07:14.520
 so I've decided to go with kunis to see how they clean these huge 

00:07:14.519 --> 00:07:21.439
 alcoves the smallest of 54 square meters and the Swiss from 86 to 164 

00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:24.129
