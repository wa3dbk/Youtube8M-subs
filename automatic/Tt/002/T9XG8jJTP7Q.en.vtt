at<00:00:17.310> a<00:00:17.340> time<00:00:17.430> there<00:00:17.910> are<00:00:17.940> what<00:00:18.210> eight<00:00:18.690> hundred

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:19.140 
at a time there are what eight hundred

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.990 
at a time there are what eight hundred
guys<00:00:19.380> in<00:00:19.619> that<00:00:19.740> room<00:00:19.800> so<00:00:20.400> that's<00:00:20.580> four<00:00:20.970> hundred

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.000 
guys in that room so that's four hundred

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.660 
guys in that room so that's four hundred
times<00:00:21.570> whatever<00:00:21.869> the<00:00:22.080> mean<00:00:22.260> jerk<00:00:22.560> time<00:00:22.859> is<00:00:23.130> the

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
times whatever the mean jerk time is the

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.820 
times whatever the mean jerk time is the
one<00:00:23.789> mean<00:00:24.510> jerk<00:00:24.869> time<00:00:25.170> I<00:00:25.410> mean<00:00:25.590> it<00:00:25.710> doesn't

one mean jerk time I mean it doesn't

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.370 
one mean jerk time I mean it doesn't
matter<00:00:26.130> but<00:00:26.460> hypothetically<00:00:27.390> time<00:00:27.869> is<00:00:28.080> equal

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
matter but hypothetically time is equal

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.169 
matter but hypothetically time is equal
to<00:00:28.470> foreigner<00:00:28.830> total<00:00:29.160> jerks<00:00:29.400> at<00:00:29.609> a<00:00:29.640> to<00:00:29.910> dick

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179

rate unless Erlich jerks up four guys at
a<00:00:33.840> time<00:00:33.870> and<00:00:34.230> then<00:00:34.350> we<00:00:34.440> can<00:00:34.530> cut<00:00:34.680> that<00:00:34.829> in<00:00:34.890> half

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
a time and then we can cut that in half

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.459 
a time and then we can cut that in half
how<00:00:35.579> would<00:00:35.730> he<00:00:35.790> do<00:00:35.940> four<00:00:36.239> guys<00:00:36.719> he's<00:00:37.050> got<00:00:37.260> two

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
how would he do four guys he's got two

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.319 
how would he do four guys he's got two
hands<00:00:37.920> so<00:00:37.950> that's<00:00:38.190> two<00:00:38.489> dicks<00:00:38.820> at<00:00:39.000> a<00:00:39.030> time

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
hands so that's two dicks at a time

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.060 
hands so that's two dicks at a time
right<00:00:39.570> or<00:00:39.780> do<00:00:39.870> you<00:00:39.960> have<00:00:40.079> two<00:00:40.350> guys<00:00:40.559> on<00:00:40.620> either

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
right or do you have two guys on either

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.250 
right or do you have two guys on either
side<00:00:41.520> with<00:00:41.879> their<00:00:42.090> decks<00:00:42.390> tip<00:00:42.780> to<00:00:42.960> tip<00:00:43.200> so

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
side with their decks tip to tip so

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.350 
side with their decks tip to tip so
you're<00:00:43.649> going<00:00:44.010> full<00:00:44.280> length<00:00:44.870> for<00:00:45.870> c/o<00:00:47.360> from

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
you're going full length for c/o from

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.910 
you're going full length for c/o from
the<00:00:48.480> middle<00:00:48.719> out<00:00:48.870> that<00:00:49.170> does<00:00:49.350> make<00:00:49.500> sense

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
the middle out that does make sense

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.069 
the middle out that does make sense
to<00:00:50.190> shake<00:00:50.430> ways<00:00:50.640> yeah<00:00:51.120> so<00:00:51.510> what<00:00:51.750> we're<00:00:51.930> trying

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
to shake ways yeah so what we're trying

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.680 
to shake ways yeah so what we're trying
to<00:00:52.260> do<00:00:52.500> hypothetically<00:00:53.430> is<00:00:53.610> minimize<00:00:54.270> time

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
to do hypothetically is minimize time

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.520 
to do hypothetically is minimize time
which<00:00:55.289> is<00:00:55.530> 800<00:00:56.520> dudes<00:00:56.789> x<00:00:57.449> mean<00:00:57.809> jerk<00:00:58.199> time

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
which is 800 dudes x mean jerk time

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.889 
which is 800 dudes x mean jerk time
divided<00:00:59.160> by<00:00:59.280> four<00:00:59.640> dicks<00:00:59.940> at<00:01:00.210> a<00:01:00.239> time<00:01:00.539> of

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
divided by four dicks at a time of

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.930 
divided by four dicks at a time of
course<00:01:01.230> Orlick<00:01:01.590> would<00:01:01.710> have<00:01:01.890> to<00:01:02.070> presort<00:01:02.699> guys

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
course Orlick would have to presort guys

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:05.119 
course Orlick would have to presort guys
by<00:01:03.180> height<00:01:03.449> so<00:01:03.719> that<00:01:03.750> their<00:01:04.140> dicks<00:01:04.530> lined<00:01:04.890> up

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
by height so that their dicks lined up

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.460 
by height so that their dicks lined up
not<00:01:05.400> by<00:01:05.580> high<00:01:05.820> technically<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:07.049> measurement

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
not by high technically the measurement

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.530 
not by high technically the measurement
that<00:01:07.530> we're<00:01:07.650> looking<00:01:07.770> for<00:01:07.950> really<00:01:08.280> is<00:01:08.700> dicta

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540

know<00:01:14.970> if<00:01:15.030> a<00:01:15.090> guy's<00:01:15.270> dick<00:01:15.689> was<00:01:16.290> long<00:01:16.619> enough<00:01:16.799> he

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
know if a guy's dick was long enough he

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.280 
know if a guy's dick was long enough he
would<00:01:17.460> be<00:01:17.580> able<00:01:17.729> to<00:01:17.790> reach<00:01:18.000> up<00:01:18.240> or<00:01:18.540> down<00:01:18.869> to

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.300 
longer the dick the greater the D to F
bridge<00:01:24.360> I<00:01:24.750> would<00:01:25.290> still<00:01:25.500> be<00:01:25.650> able<00:01:25.740> to<00:01:25.920> jerk<00:01:26.189> it

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
bridge I would still be able to jerk it

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.539 
bridge I would still be able to jerk it
off<00:01:26.490> in<00:01:26.820> one<00:01:26.880> smooth<00:01:27.509> motion<00:01:27.810> I<00:01:28.430> would<00:01:29.430> just

off in one smooth motion I would just

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:31.370 
off in one smooth motion I would just
have<00:01:29.729> to<00:01:29.820> jerk<00:01:30.060> it<00:01:30.119> on<00:01:30.240> an<00:01:30.360> angle<00:01:30.509> so<00:01:30.869> D<00:01:31.110> to<00:01:31.229> F

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
have to jerk it on an angle so D to F

right<00:01:51.640> yeah<00:01:54.509> guys<00:01:55.509> this<00:01:55.960> girth<00:01:56.290> similarity

00:01:56.999 --> 00:01:57.009 
right yeah guys this girth similarity

00:01:57.009 --> 00:01:58.620 
right yeah guys this girth similarity

different dicks simultaneously shit yeah

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:18.230 
different dicks simultaneously shit yeah
I<00:02:06.159> think<00:02:06.399> it<00:02:06.490> would

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:18.240 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:20.430

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
of course it does

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:25.050 
of course it does
time<00:02:20.980> to<00:02:21.160> orgasm<00:02:21.730> or<00:02:22.260> t2o<00:02:23.520> has<00:02:24.520> to<00:02:24.670> be<00:02:24.760> the<00:02:24.850> same

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060

for each matching pair of dicks

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:27.510 
for each matching pair of dicks
otherwise<00:02:26.620> I'm<00:02:26.770> wasting<00:02:27.070> a<00:02:27.130> lot<00:02:27.250> of<00:02:27.370> great

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:27.520 
otherwise I'm wasting a lot of great

a<00:02:31.840> downstroke<00:02:32.470> you<00:02:32.710> get<00:02:32.860> a<00:02:32.890> new<00:02:33.070> one<00:02:33.220> in<00:02:33.430> so

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
a downstroke you get a new one in so

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:35.250 
a downstroke you get a new one in so
when<00:02:34.090> you<00:02:34.120> stroke<00:02:34.450> up<00:02:34.660> you're<00:02:34.810> not<00:02:34.900> wasting

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
when you stroke up you're not wasting

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.260 
when you stroke up you're not wasting
any<00:02:35.440> energy<00:02:35.530> even<00:02:36.340> so<00:02:36.580> I<00:02:36.610> think<00:02:36.760> this<00:02:37.090> is<00:02:37.180> the

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.270 
any energy even so I think this is the

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:39.500 
any energy even so I think this is the
most<00:02:37.390> reliable<00:02:37.630> metric<00:02:38.110> for<00:02:38.200> stamina<00:02:38.500> guys
