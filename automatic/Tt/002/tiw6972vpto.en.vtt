00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
doing our thing and but even I think

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.810 
doing our thing and but even I think
what<00:01:08.790> on<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.180> animated<00:01:09.630> shows<00:01:09.810> you<00:01:10.380> know<00:01:10.500> I<00:01:10.530> I

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:10.820 
what on the animated shows you know I I

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.010 
what on the animated shows you know I I

what happens is when you have a chance

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.050 
what happens is when you have a chance
to<00:01:15.720> create<00:01:15.990> a<00:01:16.140> town<00:01:16.619> like<00:01:17.430> you<00:01:17.670> could<00:01:17.970> the

his<00:02:00.210> way<00:02:00.479> I<00:02:00.810> mean<00:02:01.020> I<00:02:01.079> i<00:02:01.290> we<00:02:01.890> didn't<00:02:02.070> think<00:02:02.219> is

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
his way I mean I i we didn't think is

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.670 
his way I mean I i we didn't think is
going<00:02:02.610> in<00:02:02.820> but<00:02:03.270> he's<00:02:03.420> he<00:02:03.780> does<00:02:04.110> have<00:02:04.350> some

approaching<00:02:55.980> this<00:02:56.549> of<00:02:56.819> taking<00:02:57.540> our

00:02:57.649 --> 00:02:57.659 
approaching this of taking our

00:02:57.659 --> 00:02:58.909 
approaching this of taking our
characters<00:02:58.139> and<00:02:58.349> putting<00:02:58.620> them<00:02:58.739> in

established roles from a from an already
made<00:03:02.280> peace<00:03:02.819> and<00:03:03.200> I<00:03:04.200> think<00:03:04.919> we've<00:03:05.569> again<00:03:06.569> now

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
made peace and I think we've again now

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:08.720 
made peace and I think we've again now
that<00:03:06.840> we<00:03:07.019> know<00:03:07.049> these<00:03:07.379> characters<00:03:07.680> you<00:03:08.609> can

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
that we know these characters you can

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.640 
that we know these characters you can
place<00:03:09.030> them<00:03:09.299> in<00:03:09.629> these<00:03:09.930> other<00:03:10.169> kind<00:03:10.590> of

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
place them in these other kind of

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.649 
place them in these other kind of
archetypal<00:03:11.219> situation<00:03:12.150> could<00:03:12.359> have<00:03:12.510> done<00:03:12.629> I

00:03:12.649 --> 00:03:12.659 
archetypal situation could have done I

00:03:12.659 --> 00:03:14.420 
archetypal situation could have done I
the<00:03:12.840> season<00:03:13.169> one<00:03:13.290> or<00:03:13.319> even<00:03:13.469> season<00:03:13.919> two<00:03:14.099> I<00:03:14.280> mean

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430 
the season one or even season two I mean

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:15.679 
the season one or even season two I mean
I<00:03:14.519> think<00:03:14.669> this<00:03:14.730> is<00:03:14.790> the<00:03:14.939> earliest<00:03:15.090> you<00:03:15.540> can

00:03:15.679 --> 00:03:15.689 
I think this is the earliest you can

00:03:15.689 --> 00:03:18.800 
I think this is the earliest you can
because<00:03:16.379> it's<00:03:16.560> fun<00:03:16.829> to<00:03:17.010> then<00:03:17.159> see<00:03:17.430> right<00:03:18.030> jr.

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
because it's fun to then see right jr.

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.869 
because it's fun to then see right jr.
actually<00:03:19.319> looks<00:03:19.530> a<00:03:19.620> little<00:03:19.739> like<00:03:19.949> the<00:03:20.220> cop<00:03:20.459> who

00:03:20.869 --> 00:03:20.879 
actually looks a little like the cop who
