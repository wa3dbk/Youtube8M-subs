00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.940
 hi everyone do twice that 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.490
 these 360 we meet all the video 

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:24.810
 nickname of storm generations so this 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.189
 this time I make myself a little bit 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.590
 special because in fact I'm going to 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:29.160
 introduce a geek that I found on 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.530
 Youtube 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.150
 kas is simple who will you 

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:35.550
 to be able to play with 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:37.410
 support the people play a game 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.239
 support but it does work like a 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.370
 practice know so it will not work 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:42.559
 not online way better not that that 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.540
 walk better you will quickly understand 

00:00:42.559 --> 00:00:47.970
 you have to go to see one 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:50.100
 against player 2 and play a game 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:52.620
 normal because it's not very 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:54.570
 complicated finally you'll see it's 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.769
 once we have supported we can not 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:56.940
 do much with him no 

00:00:55.769 --> 00:00:58.680
 melee there is no kunda and 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.720
 hell cloud or below because that's 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.750
 the only thing we do not know 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.430
 nobody knows anyway enough fun 

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.740
 for those who want to do that 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.720
 to be quite funny so sailing then I 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.400
 I quickly took a 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.030
 pretty fast character that I can pc 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:17.070
 attack the defense first we have me 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:21.540
 I tested the bug it's funny 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:23.580
 yes why do I do that use the facts 

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.500
 go back to stupidly while I 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.360
 could quickly let go I do not think he has 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.150
 had with the bad luck that will live him 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:37.950
 remained a double what I 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:40.110
 said once that the match is 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.300
 finish you're going to have to go in 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.700
 free fight mode you'll see what 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:46.050
 you show all that so here you are 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:47.520
 play with all the support also that 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:48.660
 marseille all but what it takes if 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.430
 you knew the replacement 

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:54.060
 you're going to actually see it's not very 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:57.270
 complicated just go in 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:02:00.330
 free fight menus you have selected 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.010
 a workout mode workouts by 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.330
 teams 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:06.870
 and when you move your 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:08.569
 slider to choose your character that 

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:12.230
 has also moved that of the computer 

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:14.930
 here is choose your character once there 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:18.019
 the agreement excuse me I was wrong 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:20.689
 once the window was called us 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:22.939
 will alas that's it you chose a 

00:02:20.689 --> 00:02:26.030
 characters are equal to you so there you 

00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:29.299
 take a random support here I have 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:31.459
 chose darui just for fun because 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:33.620
 that I like to arrive then in 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:34.909
 the annexed naruto left us not so 

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.319
 quite normal because peace 

00:02:34.909 --> 00:02:36.799
 must tell yourself that you have chosen a 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:38.180
 character 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:41.840
 Besides, it's funny because you 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:44.000
 do not have support here and there you 

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.299
 are daru we could not do big 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.180
 thing 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:49.329
 yes it's like a duck he's not moving 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.609
 when he jumps could do it at all 

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:54.230
 this case is funny 

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:57.230
 until then it's not going secret technique 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:03:00.459
 no sorry when you support I am 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:02.930
 not what he has to say enlightened parkinson 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:05.329
 you can call support mons to get 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.469
 beat is important and the nayda decor 

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:08.780
 yes it's true when you 're in 

00:03:06.469 --> 00:03:11.319
 balance and we learn that since chakra 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:15.469
 charge very slowly which is weird 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:17.120
 but object or wii these judges have 

00:03:15.469 --> 00:03:18.859
 forgot to tell you shouting was not doing the 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.510
 objects will you block the character 

00:03:18.859 --> 00:03:23.329
 so here I can do nothing except 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:24.440
 called my support so here on this 

00:03:23.329 --> 00:03:26.419
