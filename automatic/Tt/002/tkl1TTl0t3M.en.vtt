00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
the video but i think that there's an

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.130 
the video but i think that there's an
equal<00:02:24.310> amount<00:02:24.430> of<00:02:24.760> campers<00:02:25.420> with<00:02:25.720> something

happens<00:02:40.120> and<00:02:40.360> so<00:02:40.750> my<00:02:41.500> point<00:02:41.710> what<00:02:41.920> that<00:02:42.040> is

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
happens and so my point what that is

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.790 
happens and so my point what that is
that<00:02:42.880> yeah<00:02:43.120> there's<00:02:43.390> tampers<00:02:44.230> and<00:02:44.410> swap<00:02:44.620> but

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 
that yeah there's tampers and swap but

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.270 
that yeah there's tampers and swap but
there's<00:02:44.950> also<00:02:45.160> campers<00:02:45.820> in<00:02:46.000> um<00:02:46.920> Slayers<00:02:47.920> well

that weapon everybody has that weapon
from<00:04:02.200> the<00:04:02.380> start<00:04:02.709> and<00:04:02.890> so<00:04:03.400> how<00:04:03.640> is<00:04:03.700> it

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 
from the start and so how is it

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.530 
from the start and so how is it
imbalanced<00:04:04.690> if<00:04:04.840> everybody<00:04:05.560> has<00:04:05.830> the<00:04:06.160> weapon

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:06.540 
imbalanced if everybody has the weapon

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.750 
imbalanced if everybody has the weapon
everybody<00:04:07.540> can<00:04:07.780> use<00:04:07.959> the<00:04:08.170> weapon<00:04:08.590> there<00:04:09.370> is<00:04:09.519> no

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:09.760 
everybody can use the weapon there is no

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.360 
everybody can use the weapon there is no
other<00:04:09.910> option<00:04:10.330> besides<00:04:11.140> to<00:04:11.769> use<00:04:11.950> that<00:04:12.220> weapon

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:12.370 
other option besides to use that weapon

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:15.240 
other option besides to use that weapon
so<00:04:12.700> how<00:04:12.940> is<00:04:13.000> it<00:04:13.239> unbalanced<00:04:13.989> if<00:04:14.110> everybody<00:04:15.100> is

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:15.250 
so how is it unbalanced if everybody is

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:17.550 
so how is it unbalanced if everybody is
the<00:04:15.459> same<00:04:15.489> to<00:04:16.330> be<00:04:16.450> unbalanced<00:04:16.959> everyone<00:04:17.380> has

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:17.560 
the same to be unbalanced everyone has

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.590 
the same to be unbalanced everyone has
to<00:04:17.709> be<00:04:17.830> different<00:04:18.310> and<00:04:18.430> when<00:04:18.580> one<00:04:19.000> person<00:04:19.450> has
