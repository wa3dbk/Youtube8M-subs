we'll go ahead and we'll scan this range
while<00:01:17.130> skiing<00:01:17.369> in<00:01:17.640> the<00:01:17.670> effect<00:01:18.479> range<00:01:19.580> for<00:01:20.580> you

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
someone German let's change it to scan

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.880 
someone German let's change it to scan
in<00:01:35.040> image<00:01:35.369> mode<00:01:36.290> this<00:01:37.290> is<00:01:37.409> actually<00:01:37.740> pretty

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
in image mode this is actually pretty

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.210 
in image mode this is actually pretty
cool<00:01:38.100> as<00:01:38.250> well<00:01:38.280> all<00:01:39.000> right<00:01:39.150> now<00:01:39.299> we'll<00:01:39.450> scan<00:01:39.689> in

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:40.220 
cool as well all right now we'll scan in

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.469 
cool as well all right now we'll scan in
the<00:01:41.220> name<00:01:41.430> and<00:01:41.790> you'll<00:01:42.030> actually<00:01:42.150> get<00:01:42.360> the

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
the name and you'll actually get the

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.200 
the name and you'll actually get the
chance<00:01:42.720> to<00:01:42.869> actually<00:01:43.680> get<00:01:44.100> to<00:01:44.130> see<00:01:44.399> what<00:01:45.060> this

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
chance to actually get to see what this

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.719 
chance to actually get to see what this
actually<00:01:45.450> looks<00:01:45.780> like<00:01:45.990> a<00:01:46.049> zit<00:01:46.350> beams<00:01:46.590> in<00:01:46.920> to

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.999 
actually looks like a zit beams in to
the<00:01:47.970> system<00:01:48.180> it's<00:01:48.810> actually<00:01:49.110> pretty<00:01:49.200> cool<00:01:49.439> let

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
the system it's actually pretty cool let

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:51.649 
the system it's actually pretty cool let
me<00:01:50.070> do<00:01:50.220> it<00:01:50.250> again<00:01:50.549> because<00:01:50.970> my<00:01:51.000> screen<00:01:51.420> share

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.530 
see it actually scans in pretty well I'm
in<00:02:01.500> for<00:02:01.799> this<00:02:01.950> system<00:02:02.189> so<00:02:02.670> it<00:02:03.000> picks<00:02:03.240> up<00:02:03.420> the

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
in for this system so it picks up the

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.240 
in for this system so it picks up the
entire<00:02:03.780> image<00:02:04.049> you<00:02:04.229> can<00:02:04.350> scan<00:02:04.619> in<00:02:04.799> the<00:02:04.920> entire

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
entire image you can scan in the entire

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.639 
entire image you can scan in the entire
thing<00:02:05.280> and<00:02:05.729> the<00:02:06.420> recognition<00:02:06.750> software<00:02:07.200> that

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
thing and the recognition software that

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.320 
thing and the recognition software that
it<00:02:07.740> scans<00:02:08.039> as<00:02:08.250> you<00:02:08.340> can<00:02:08.520> see<00:02:08.700> it<00:02:08.849> picks<00:02:09.090> it<00:02:09.209> up

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
it scans as you can see it picks it up

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:11.809 
it scans as you can see it picks it up
and<00:02:09.479> then<00:02:09.899> scans<00:02:10.170> it<00:02:10.349> in<00:02:10.440> the<00:02:10.530> system<00:02:10.950> the<00:02:11.610> last

00:02:11.809 --> 00:02:11.819 
and then scans it in the system the last

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:12.540 
and then scans it in the system the last
thing<00:02:12.000> that

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:12.550 
thing that

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.000 
thing that
to<00:02:12.880> demonstrate<00:02:13.060> on<00:02:13.480> this<00:02:13.660> video<00:02:13.930> is<00:02:14.230> the

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
to demonstrate on this video is the

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.210 
to demonstrate on this video is the
sentence<00:02:15.970> translation<00:02:16.630> function<00:02:16.810> alright<00:02:17.770> so

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
sentence translation function alright so

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:22.350 
sentence translation function alright so
we'll<00:02:19.090> go<00:02:19.240> ahead<00:02:19.270> and<00:02:19.750> we'll<00:02:20.500> set<00:02:21.280> this<00:02:22.090> to

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
we'll go ahead and we'll set this to

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:28.080 
we'll go ahead and we'll set this to
scan<00:02:23.010> german<00:02:24.010> into<00:02:24.250> english<00:02:24.280> alright<00:02:25.350> so<00:02:27.090> we

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
scan german into english alright so we

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:30.960 
scan german into english alright so we
get<00:02:28.210> something<00:02:28.420> pretty<00:02:28.750> basic<00:02:28.990> here<00:02:29.790> let's<00:02:30.790> go

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:30.970 
get something pretty basic here let's go

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:36.360 
get something pretty basic here let's go
back<00:02:31.180> to<00:02:31.210> the<00:02:31.540> effect<00:02:31.930> line<00:02:32.200> I<00:02:35.160> scanning<00:02:36.160> and

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:36.370 
back to the effect line I scanning and

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.990 
back to the effect line I scanning and
the<00:02:36.760> effect<00:02:37.090> line<00:02:37.620> all<00:02:38.620> right<00:02:38.710> as<00:02:39.010> you<00:02:39.550> can<00:02:39.820> see

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
the effect line all right as you can see

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.480 
the effect line all right as you can see
here<00:02:40.270> ona<00:02:40.810> picked<00:02:41.080> up<00:02:41.230> a<00:02:41.350> line<00:02:41.650> of<00:02:41.680> text<00:02:41.950> wasn't

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:42.490 
here ona picked up a line of text wasn't

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:44.370 
here ona picked up a line of text wasn't
in<00:02:42.670> the<00:02:42.760> right<00:02:42.850> position<00:02:43.240> I<00:02:43.300> suppose<00:02:43.600> alright

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:44.380 
in the right position I suppose alright

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.880 
in the right position I suppose alright
so<00:02:44.830> it<00:02:44.980> scanned<00:02:45.340> in<00:02:45.520> the<00:02:45.850> effect<00:02:46.150> so<00:02:46.890> your

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
so it scanned in the effect so your

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:49.980 
so it scanned in the effect so your
controls<00:02:48.340> a<00:02:48.490> monster<00:02:48.970> and<00:02:49.180> you<00:02:49.330> cannot<00:02:49.810> you

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:49.990 
controls a monster and you cannot you

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:52.380 
controls a monster and you cannot you
can<00:02:50.170> summon<00:02:50.440> this<00:02:50.560> monster<00:02:51.030> it's<00:02:52.030> a<00:02:52.120> really

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
can summon this monster it's a really

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.360 
can summon this monster it's a really
really<00:02:52.660> the<00:02:52.900> rough<00:02:53.020> translation<00:02:53.350> for<00:02:54.130> what<00:02:54.250> it

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
really the rough translation for what it

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.790 
really the rough translation for what it
is<00:02:54.400> but<00:02:55.120> it's<00:02:55.540> a<00:02:55.720> really<00:02:55.960> really<00:02:56.230> cool<00:02:56.350> thing

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.810 
and as long as you guys understand the
basic<00:02:58.810> translation<00:02:59.380> function<00:02:59.560> on<00:02:59.890> it<00:03:00.040> it'll

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:00.820 
basic translation function on it it'll

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:02.820 
basic translation function on it it'll
be<00:03:01.000> fine<00:03:01.240> so<00:03:01.720> it<00:03:02.200> was<00:03:02.320> just<00:03:02.350> something<00:03:02.650> I

functions um it can speak to you on your
translation<00:03:22.600> you<00:03:22.690> can<00:03:22.810> scan<00:03:23.140> in<00:03:23.380> bar<00:03:23.620> codes

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
translation you can scan in bar codes

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.430 
translation you can scan in bar codes
like<00:03:25.180> I<00:03:25.239> said<00:03:25.300> you<00:03:25.570> can<00:03:25.630> talk<00:03:25.959> to<00:03:26.110> you<00:03:26.260> can
