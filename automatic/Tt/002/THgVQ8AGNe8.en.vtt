I guess still the champion so in this
case<00:02:51.990> I<00:02:52.170> think<00:02:52.320> it's<00:02:52.410> gonna<00:02:52.500> be<00:02:52.650> no<00:02:52.770> different

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
case I think it's gonna be no different

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:54.920 
case I think it's gonna be no different
I<00:02:53.490> think<00:02:53.820> our<00:02:53.940> troop<00:02:54.210> I<00:02:54.330> mean<00:02:54.480> our<00:02:54.600> take<00:02:54.810> I

I think our troop I mean our take I

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:57.380 
I think our troop I mean our take I
think<00:02:54.960> Curtis<00:02:55.380> axle<00:02:55.980> is<00:02:56.730> going<00:02:57.030> to<00:02:57.120> win<00:02:57.270> this

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:57.390

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.510 
matchup if he isn't going to win the
matchup<00:02:59.790> then<00:03:00.270> maybe<00:03:00.950> lose<00:03:01.950> the<00:03:02.100> match<00:03:02.250> up<00:03:02.430> by
