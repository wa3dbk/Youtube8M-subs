this<00:01:15.049> like<00:01:15.259> a<00:01:15.290> prizefight<00:01:15.979> you'd<00:01:16.159> give<00:01:16.369> it<00:01:16.490> to

00:01:16.569 --> 00:01:16.579 
this like a prizefight you'd give it to

00:01:16.579 --> 00:01:18.100 
this like a prizefight you'd give it to
Dartmouth<00:01:16.939> as<00:01:17.119> much<00:01:17.299> as<00:01:17.450> that<00:01:17.570> doesn't<00:01:17.930> count

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.110 
Dartmouth as much as that doesn't count

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:20.800

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
it's at least reassuring for the team to

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:22.209 
it's at least reassuring for the team to
know<00:01:20.990> that<00:01:21.289> they're<00:01:21.439> right<00:01:21.679> in<00:01:21.859> this<00:01:22.009> with
