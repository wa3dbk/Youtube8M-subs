00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 one of the greatest fears of a man 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.339
 when proposing a date to a woman is 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.930
 to be rejected by her and the truth is 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:08.790
 I understand it because to propose 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.860
 an appointment to the woman and that she accepts 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.900
 you must have several things in mind and for 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.670
 course start forgetting that you 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.230
 asking a woman for an appointment is like 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.390
 ask a man if he wants 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.279
 staying with you will tell you that if you tell him 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.529
 what you say and what you propose 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:23.939
 propose none of that first thing to have 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:26.010
 into account when asking for an appointment to a 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.619
 woman especially if it's a first 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.210
 appointment is not to activate your defenses this is 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.430
 get proposing a little plan 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.530
 intimidating in a little intimidating place 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.360
 it is best to choose a public place 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.280
 where she does not feel any kind of 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.379
 pressure and you can leave when you want 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.570
 for example, although it may sound similar 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:44.969
 compares the fact of going to take some 

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:48.180
 cocktails in the center of the city or 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:50.430
 go to dinner downtown go to 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.530
 dine is much more invasive and sounds 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.120
 much more formal than proposing to go to 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.010
 take something in the afternoon and I do not tell you anymore 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.840
 nothing if you propose to pick it up to take it 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.820
 to a place far from your house where 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.859
 depend on you to return personally 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.899
 What I recommend most is that you do not 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.159
 expose too much if it is not necessary and 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.170
 propose a plan 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.939
 that you are going to do anyway is 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.069
 To say that you have a message to accompany you 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.200
 buy a book to skate to do 

00:01:11.069 --> 00:01:15.299
 sport stroll on the beach whatever 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.130
 something that you can do anyway 

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:19.229
 although she tells you no and since you're 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:21.209
 you who propose the appointment make sure 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.100
 go to a place where you are comfortable and you 

00:01:21.209 --> 00:01:25.380
 You feel comfortable because the more you 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:27.599
 controls the most comfortable ground you 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.219
 you will feel and better reflect it until the 

00:01:27.599 --> 00:01:31.079
 other person is not more than 

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:33.329
 make a temporary limitation of the appointment 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.189
 that is, telling him that you are going to 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.349
 be able to be for an hour and a half or two 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:37.649
 hours because then you have things that 

00:01:37.349 --> 00:01:39.239
 do 

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:41.729
 then calibrate yours and stay or 

00:01:39.239 --> 00:01:43.319
 leave but I advise you to do the 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:44.879
 First, finish the appointment so 

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:46.140
 leave her wanting more 

00:01:44.879 --> 00:01:47.849
 I'm going to keep pulling out a lot of 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.200
 tips like this is so subscribe 

00:01:47.849 --> 00:01:50.610
