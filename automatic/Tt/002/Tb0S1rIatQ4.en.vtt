came<00:00:44.129> with<00:00:44.160> this<00:00:44.399> particular<00:00:44.730> model<00:00:45.120> that<00:00:45.420> we

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
came with this particular model that we

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:48.860 
came with this particular model that we
have<00:00:45.719> labeled<00:00:46.500> what's<00:00:46.860> that<00:00:47.070> noise<00:00:47.340> so<00:00:48.059> since

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:48.870 
have labeled what's that noise so since

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:49.760 
have labeled what's that noise so since
we're<00:00:48.989> going<00:00:49.079> to<00:00:49.140> be<00:00:49.200> working<00:00:49.379> with<00:00:49.559> that

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
we're going to be working with that

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:52.610 
we're going to be working with that
we'll<00:00:50.010> just<00:00:50.039> put<00:00:50.309> that<00:00:50.430> in<00:00:51.350> nothing<00:00:52.350> going<00:00:52.530> on

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
we'll just put that in nothing going on

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.590 
we'll just put that in nothing going on
this<00:00:52.860> side<00:00:53.070> very<00:00:53.399> much<00:00:53.610> except<00:00:54.000> for<00:00:54.180> the<00:00:54.270> USB

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
this side very much except for the USB

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.510 
this side very much except for the USB
slot<00:00:55.020> this<00:00:55.440> is<00:00:55.590> where<00:00:55.739> you<00:00:55.800> put<00:00:55.980> your<00:00:56.039> micro

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
slot this is where you put your micro

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:59.930 
slot this is where you put your micro
USB<00:00:56.550> and<00:00:57.890> you'd<00:00:58.890> connect<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.309> other<00:00:59.430> side<00:00:59.730> to

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
USB and you'd connect the other side to

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.869 
USB and you'd connect the other side to
your<00:01:00.059> computer<00:01:01.129> so<00:01:02.129> on<00:01:02.250> the<00:01:02.370> bottom<00:01:02.520> here<00:01:02.850> you

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
your computer so on the bottom here you

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.280 
your computer so on the bottom here you
see<00:01:03.300> that<00:01:03.539> there<00:01:03.719> is<00:01:03.750> a<00:01:04.700> DC<00:01:05.700> adapter<00:01:06.330> so<00:01:07.020> if<00:01:07.140> you

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
see that there is a DC adapter so if you

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.320 
see that there is a DC adapter so if you
run<00:01:07.439> out<00:01:07.500> of<00:01:07.619> batteries<00:01:08.100> you<00:01:08.280> can<00:01:08.310> always<00:01:08.790> run

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
run out of batteries you can always run

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.500 
run out of batteries you can always run
it<00:01:09.510> via<00:01:09.720> DC<00:01:10.430> goes<00:01:11.430> into<00:01:11.640> your<00:01:11.700> wall<00:01:11.909> jack<00:01:12.150> the

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
it via DC goes into your wall jack the

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.840 
it via DC goes into your wall jack the
keep<00:01:12.720> in<00:01:12.869> mind<00:01:13.110> that<00:01:13.380> when<00:01:13.950> you<00:01:14.040> buy<00:01:14.220> the<00:01:14.280> VTech

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
keep in mind that when you buy the VTech

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.870 
keep in mind that when you buy the VTech
be<00:01:15.090> meter<00:01:15.590> the<00:01:16.590> DC<00:01:16.979> adapter<00:01:17.460> doesn't<00:01:17.759> come

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:17.880 
be meter the DC adapter doesn't come

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.609 
be meter the DC adapter doesn't come
with<00:01:18.000> the<00:01:18.119> unit<00:01:18.150> so<00:01:18.750> you'll<00:01:18.900> have<00:01:19.080> to<00:01:19.259> actually

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
with the unit so you'll have to actually

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.200 
with the unit so you'll have to actually
buy<00:01:19.860> that<00:01:20.070> separately<00:01:20.430> as<00:01:20.759> well<00:01:20.820> as<00:01:21.000> the
