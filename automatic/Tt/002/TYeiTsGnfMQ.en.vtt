00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:16.840 
but uh I've known this existed for years

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.659 
but uh I've known this existed for years
like<00:04:17.049> I<00:04:17.199> said<00:04:17.440> I<00:04:17.470> download<00:04:17.979> and<00:04:18.130> burn<00:04:18.310> the<00:04:18.489> disc

00:04:18.659 --> 00:04:18.669 
like I said I download and burn the disc

00:04:18.669 --> 00:04:22.740 
like I said I download and burn the disc
years<00:04:19.000> ago<00:04:19.269> but<00:04:20.260> uh<00:04:20.290> I<00:04:20.940> suppose<00:04:21.940> I'm<00:04:22.449> gonna<00:04:22.570> get

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:22.750 
years ago but uh I suppose I'm gonna get

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:24.629 
years ago but uh I suppose I'm gonna get
an<00:04:22.840> onslaught<00:04:23.350> of<00:04:23.410> people<00:04:23.590> asking<00:04:24.460> me<00:04:24.520> to

00:04:24.629 --> 00:04:24.639 
an onslaught of people asking me to

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:27.750 
an onslaught of people asking me to
upload<00:04:24.970> the<00:04:25.330> image<00:04:25.360> for<00:04:25.870> this<00:04:25.990> I<00:04:26.639> guess<00:04:27.639> I'll

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:27.760 
upload the image for this I guess I'll

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:30.110 
upload the image for this I guess I'll
have<00:04:27.850> to<00:04:27.910> load<00:04:28.150> it<00:04:28.180> up<00:04:28.389> in<00:04:28.540> disc<00:04:28.780> juggler<00:04:29.290> if<00:04:29.889> I

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120 
have to load it up in disc juggler if I

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.090 
have to load it up in disc juggler if I
to<00:04:31.120> get<00:04:31.300> it<00:04:31.449> to<00:04:31.600> be<00:04:31.780> uh<00:04:31.810> I<00:04:32.380> know<00:04:32.680> I<00:04:32.770> can't<00:04:33.039> just

00:04:33.090 --> 00:04:33.100 
to get it to be uh I know I can't just

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:36.180 
to get it to be uh I know I can't just
make<00:04:33.340> an<00:04:33.460> ISO<00:04:33.789> of<00:04:33.820> it<00:04:34.150> it<00:04:34.750> has<00:04:34.900> to<00:04:35.050> be<00:04:35.169> a<00:04:35.199> multi

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:36.190 
make an ISO of it it has to be a multi

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:39.870 
make an ISO of it it has to be a multi
session<00:04:36.690> image<00:04:37.690> so<00:04:38.620> therefore<00:04:39.100> I'm<00:04:39.280> I<00:04:39.520> have<00:04:39.760> to

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:39.880 
session image so therefore I'm I have to

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:45.659
