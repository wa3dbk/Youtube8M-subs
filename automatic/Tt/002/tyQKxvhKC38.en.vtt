the<00:02:13.680> basic<00:02:14.010> premise<00:02:14.190> is<00:02:14.580> that<00:02:14.610> you<00:02:15.150> have<00:02:15.450> one

the<00:02:24.150> other<00:02:24.330> one<00:02:24.599> would<00:02:24.870> be<00:02:25.019> for<00:02:25.230> the<00:02:25.319> UI<00:02:25.530> and<00:02:25.860> so

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
the other one would be for the UI and so

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.460 
the other one would be for the UI and so
