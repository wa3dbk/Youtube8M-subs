00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
finals Oh last year obviously was a

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.580 
finals Oh last year obviously was a
tough<00:00:18.330> result<00:00:18.660> for<00:00:18.810> us<00:00:18.869> but<00:00:19.140> we've<00:00:19.470> been

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590 
tough result for us but we've been

tough result for us but we've been
training<00:00:19.800> Welford<00:00:20.250> and<00:00:20.430> I<00:00:20.460> think<00:00:21.060> everyone<00:00:21.390> is

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
training Welford and I think everyone is

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.179 
training Welford and I think everyone is
prepared<00:00:21.750> for<00:00:21.900> so<00:00:22.140> I<00:00:22.380> think<00:00:22.800> we<00:00:22.949> got<00:00:23.070> a<00:00:23.100> good

00:00:23.179 --> 00:00:23.189 
prepared for so I think we got a good

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:24.470 
prepared for so I think we got a good
shot<00:00:23.340> at<00:00:23.490> it<00:00:23.609> and<00:00:23.880> we're<00:00:24.029> looking<00:00:24.240> to<00:00:24.330> come

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:24.480 
shot at it and we're looking to come

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:25.790

back<00:00:24.630> with<00:00:24.750> the<00:00:24.869> gold<00:00:25.050> so<00:00:25.289> I<00:00:25.470> think<00:00:25.590> hitting

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
back with the gold so I think hitting

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.259

past weekend we beat them twice with

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.289 
past weekend we beat them twice with
through<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.189> club<00:01:32.430> and<00:01:32.670> I<00:01:32.970> think<00:01:33.180> they're

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:33.299 
through the club and I think they're

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:35.510

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
to be a rough game and battle I think we

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.069 
to be a rough game and battle I think we
should<00:01:38.460> come<00:01:38.790> together<00:01:38.939> more<00:01:39.509> now<00:01:39.750> than<00:01:39.930> ever
