this method is quite slow the great

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.920 
this method is quite slow the great

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:50.420 
guide about source Reds garden I'm
simply<00:01:48.869> running<00:01:49.350> through<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:49.920> middle<00:01:49.950> and

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430 
simply running through the middle and

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.060 
simply running through the middle and
getting<00:01:51.119> the<00:01:51.210> fruit<00:01:51.540> so<00:01:52.079> don't<00:01:52.320> consider<00:01:52.799> this

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
getting the fruit so don't consider this

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.690 
getting the fruit so don't consider this
to<00:01:53.280> be<00:01:53.399> a<00:01:53.520> guide<00:01:53.759> simply<00:01:54.390> a<00:01:55.290> demo<00:01:56.009> of<00:01:56.040> what<00:01:56.189> you

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
to be a guide simply a demo of what you

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:59.990 
to be a guide simply a demo of what you
need<00:01:56.880> to<00:01:57.090> do<00:01:57.270> if<00:01:57.479> you<00:01:57.990> want<00:01:58.350> to<00:01:58.469> do<00:01:58.680> it<00:01:58.880> so<00:01:59.880> yeah

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
need to do if you want to do it so yeah

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.700 
need to do if you want to do it so yeah
it's<00:02:00.119> very<00:02:00.329> easy<00:02:00.600> so<00:02:00.990> like<00:02:01.140> I've<00:02:01.259> just<00:02:01.469> said

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:01.710 
it's very easy so like I've just said

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.010 
it's very easy so like I've just said
you're<00:02:01.890> really<00:02:02.250> glitchy<00:02:02.579> I've<00:02:03.060> managed<00:02:03.869> to

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:04.020 
you're really glitchy I've managed to

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.639 
you're really glitchy I've managed to
get<00:02:04.200> an<00:02:04.409> average<00:02:04.619> round-trip<00:02:05.509> of<00:02:06.509> about<00:02:06.990> 35

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
get an average round-trip of about 35

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:11.420 
get an average round-trip of about 35
seconds<00:02:08.310> but<00:02:08.700> obviously<00:02:09.239> it<00:02:09.929> can<00:02:10.440> be<00:02:10.649> faster

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430 
seconds but obviously it can be faster

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.490 
seconds but obviously it can be faster
than<00:02:11.459> that<00:02:11.610> I<00:02:11.970> think<00:02:12.810> it<00:02:12.989> could

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
than that I think it could

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.730 
than that I think it could
easily<00:02:14.160> less<00:02:14.760> than<00:02:14.970> 30<00:02:15.300> seconds<00:02:15.780> pirate<00:02:16.170> /<00:02:16.500> run

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:16.740 
easily less than 30 seconds pirate / run

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.890 
easily less than 30 seconds pirate / run
and<00:02:16.950> this<00:02:17.580> means<00:02:17.790> that<00:02:17.970> this<00:02:18.420> method<00:02:18.630> is

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900 
and this means that this method is

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.800 
and this means that this method is
currently<00:02:19.350> 180<00:02:20.280> k<00:02:20.760> experience<00:02:21.300> in<00:02:21.420> thieving

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
currently 180 k experience in thieving

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:24.110 
currently 180 k experience in thieving
per<00:02:22.230> hour<00:02:22.380> which<00:02:22.740> is<00:02:22.980> really<00:02:23.400> really<00:02:23.790> good

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
per hour which is really really good

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:28.310 
per hour which is really really good
experience<00:02:24.450> at<00:02:24.990> level<00:02:25.500> 65<00:02:26.630> so<00:02:27.630> yeah<00:02:27.840> your<00:02:28.170> goal

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:28.320 
experience at level 65 so yeah your goal

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:30.230 
experience at level 65 so yeah your goal
is<00:02:28.350> to<00:02:28.500> go<00:02:28.680> to<00:02:28.710> the<00:02:28.920> middle<00:02:29.220> and<00:02:29.400> with<00:02:30.090> the

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:30.240 
is to go to the middle and with the

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:32.480 
is to go to the middle and with the
fruits<00:02:30.570> once<00:02:31.020> you<00:02:31.290> have<00:02:31.410> two<00:02:31.770> fruits<00:02:32.070> you<00:02:32.430> can

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.490 
fruits once you have two fruits you can

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:34.550 
fruits once you have two fruits you can
squeeze<00:02:33.150> them<00:02:33.180> into<00:02:33.630> a<00:02:33.780> beer<00:02:34.020> so<00:02:34.200> that's<00:02:34.380> why<00:02:34.530> I

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:34.560 
squeeze them into a beer so that's why I

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:37.040 
squeeze them into a beer so that's why I
have<00:02:34.800> so<00:02:35.100> many<00:02:35.190> beers<00:02:35.600> glasses<00:02:36.600> in<00:02:36.990> my
