 Go north along the road just before the fork 

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:02.200

 When the weather is nice, you can see the city of Kyoto 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:40.990
 We decided to brew a cup of coffee in this Ryugatake 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:52.960
 Boil hot water with kettle 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:56.880
 Thermal power is stable due to the winter dedicated gas cartridge 

00:03:52.960 --> 00:04:00.060
 The water will use the help water that has been paired with a broom 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:03.050

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:07.510
 This kettle of gsi is recommended because it is easy to pour and it has a good texture . 

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:12.240
 If it is steamed for about 10 seconds, it will be poured in several times 

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:12.240
 If the freshness is good, coffee powder will swell 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:20.610
 Time is lunchtime 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:20.610
 Mountain climbers came and the summit suddenly became bustling 

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:27.970

 It is drip-type mountain coffee 

00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:06.350
 I enjoy the coffee slowly over a low heat because it will cool soon 

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:09.190
 Flow type remaining et al towards the climbers are in your hem divided 

00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:13.860
 Persimmon pipe on a leaf 

00:06:09.190 --> 00:06:13.860
