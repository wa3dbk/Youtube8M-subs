00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
them one side of the line until you

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.780 
them one side of the line until you
figure<00:01:04.470> out<00:01:04.500> which<00:01:04.920> side<00:01:05.159> is<00:01:05.400> going<00:01:05.549> to<00:01:05.610> pull

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
figure out which side is going to pull

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.840 
figure out which side is going to pull
the<00:01:05.909> short<00:01:06.180> end<00:01:06.920> so<00:01:07.920> all<00:01:08.010> you<00:01:08.100> do<00:01:08.280> is<00:01:08.400> you<00:01:08.549> bring

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
the short end so all you do is you bring

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.980 
the short end so all you do is you bring
in<00:01:09.030> that<00:01:09.299> short<00:01:09.780> end<00:01:10.080> all<00:01:11.010> the<00:01:11.369> way<00:01:11.490> down<00:01:11.990> just

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
in that short end all the way down just

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.350 
in that short end all the way down just
so<00:01:13.350> there's<00:01:13.530> only<00:01:13.680> a<00:01:13.770> little<00:01:14.130> bit<00:01:14.430> left<00:01:14.670> about

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
so there's only a little bit left about

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.880 
so there's only a little bit left about
as<00:01:15.479> much<00:01:15.509> as<00:01:15.840> you<00:01:15.960> would<00:01:16.080> cut<00:01:16.320> off<00:01:16.350> with<00:01:16.740> your
