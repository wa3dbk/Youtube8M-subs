00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 
we felt we're intrinsic to make sure

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.200 
we felt we're intrinsic to make sure
that<00:01:35.440> when<00:01:35.619> people<00:01:35.890> see<00:01:36.070> this<00:01:36.250> car<00:01:36.550> it's<00:01:36.880> very

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
see is a very very simple interior but

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.500 
see is a very very simple interior but
actually<00:03:42.480> everything<00:03:43.200> is<00:03:43.440> readily<00:03:44.430> available

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:44.510

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:48.300 
for the driver this car is really

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:50.990 
for the driver this car is really

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
pushing many boundaries as a GT car it's

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.640 
pushing many boundaries as a GT car it's

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
and that's where a simulation really

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:56.390 
and that's where a simulation really
comes<00:03:54.720> into<00:03:54.960> play<00:03:55.050> I<00:03:55.530> think<00:03:56.130> the<00:03:56.220> whole

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
comes into play I think the whole

lot of these cars made and not

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:32.900 
lot of these cars made and not
everyone's<00:04:32.130> going<00:04:32.250> to<00:04:32.310> get<00:04:32.400> to<00:04:32.520> build<00:04:32.670> a<00:04:32.730> drive

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:32.910 
everyone's going to get to build a drive

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:34.790 
everyone's going to get to build a drive
one<00:04:33.090> but<00:04:33.240> no<00:04:33.390> we<00:04:33.780> can<00:04:33.990> you<00:04:34.140> can<00:04:34.290> actually<00:04:34.440> do<00:04:34.680> it

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:34.800 
one but no we can you can actually do it

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.050 
one but no we can you can actually do it
virtually<00:04:35.010> and<00:04:35.340> I<00:04:35.400> think<00:04:35.550> that's<00:04:35.700> going<00:04:35.850> to<00:04:35.910> be

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:36.060 
virtually and I think that's going to be

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.270 
virtually and I think that's going to be
even<00:04:36.600> added<00:04:36.810> to<00:04:36.900> the<00:04:37.020> same<00:04:37.230> Tripucka<00:04:37.590> great

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:38.280 
even added to the same Tripucka great

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:39.980 
even added to the same Tripucka great
brands<00:04:38.580> have<00:04:38.880> really<00:04:39.180> great<00:04:39.330> stories<00:04:39.720> to<00:04:39.750> tell

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:39.990 
brands have really great stories to tell

00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:43.280 
brands have really great stories to tell
and<00:04:40.200> I<00:04:40.440> think<00:04:40.710> Forza<00:04:41.700> gives<00:04:42.000> us<00:04:42.240> a<00:04:42.510> new

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:43.290 
and I think Forza gives us a new

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:44.780 
and I think Forza gives us a new
opportunity<00:04:43.920> to<00:04:44.010> kind<00:04:44.190> of<00:04:44.250> tell<00:04:44.430> that<00:04:44.640> story

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:44.790 
opportunity to kind of tell that story

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:46.760 
opportunity to kind of tell that story
to<00:04:45.030> a<00:04:45.180> new<00:04:45.360> audience<00:04:45.540> what<00:04:46.470> a<00:04:46.500> cool<00:04:46.710> moment

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:46.770 
to a new audience what a cool moment
