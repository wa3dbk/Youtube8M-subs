little bit we're gonna be taking a
closer<00:00:17.369> look<00:00:17.490> at<00:00:17.730> that<00:00:17.940> right<00:00:18.240> now<00:00:18.270> and<00:00:18.630> as

closer look at that right now and as
always<00:00:19.050> we're<00:00:19.230> gonna<00:00:19.350> be<00:00:19.560> starting<00:00:19.859> with<00:00:20.160> the

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
always we're gonna be starting with the

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.580 
always we're gonna be starting with the
flavor<00:00:20.490> text<00:00:20.820> and<00:00:20.910> it<00:00:21.000> says<00:00:21.180> they<00:00:21.960> rest<00:00:22.260> quite

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:22.590 
flavor text and it says they rest quite

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.359 
flavor text and it says they rest quite
on<00:00:22.949> fields<00:00:23.580> afar<00:00:23.880> for<00:00:24.810> this<00:00:24.990> is<00:00:25.170> no<00:00:25.320> ending<00:00:25.680> but

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
on fields afar for this is no ending but

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.990 
on fields afar for this is no ending but
the<00:00:26.609> eye<00:00:26.640> and<00:00:27.289> but<00:00:28.289> the<00:00:28.410> eye<00:00:28.439> what<00:00:28.890> yeah<00:00:29.340> that

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000 
the eye and but the eye what yeah that

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.179 
the eye and but the eye what yeah that
kind<00:00:30.179> of<00:00:30.240> threw<00:00:30.359> me<00:00:30.420> off<00:00:30.539> but<00:00:31.230> uh<00:00:31.260> let's<00:00:32.009> get

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
kind of threw me off but uh let's get

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.770 
kind of threw me off but uh let's get
into<00:00:32.399> this<00:00:32.550> if<00:00:32.820> we<00:00:33.030> take<00:00:33.149> a<00:00:33.210> look<00:00:33.329> at<00:00:33.420> the<00:00:33.660> rate

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
into this if we take a look at the rate

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:35.630 
into this if we take a look at the rate
of<00:00:33.809> fire<00:00:34.350> and<00:00:34.620> impact<00:00:34.950> are<00:00:35.070> both<00:00:35.219> pretty<00:00:35.430> high

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
of fire and impact are both pretty high

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.490 
of fire and impact are both pretty high
for<00:00:35.700> a<00:00:35.910> machine<00:00:36.059> gun<00:00:36.300> usually<00:00:36.690> you<00:00:36.780> get<00:00:36.899> higher

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:37.500 
for a machine gun usually you get higher

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.190 
for a machine gun usually you get higher
rate<00:00:37.739> of<00:00:37.770> fire<00:00:38.040> with<00:00:38.309> low<00:00:38.520> impact<00:00:38.850> or<00:00:39.200> high

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
rate of fire with low impact or high

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.720 
rate of fire with low impact or high
impact<00:00:40.559> with<00:00:40.770> even<00:00:41.010> lower<00:00:41.190> rate<00:00:41.430> of<00:00:41.550> fire

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
impact with even lower rate of fire

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:43.760 
impact with even lower rate of fire
however<00:00:42.480> this<00:00:42.660> one<00:00:42.870> is<00:00:43.020> a<00:00:43.050> nice<00:00:43.350> middle<00:00:43.649> ground

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
however this one is a nice middle ground

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:45.139 
however this one is a nice middle ground
between<00:00:44.040> the<00:00:44.370> two<00:00:44.460> which<00:00:44.610> is<00:00:44.670> nice<00:00:44.910> to<00:00:45.090> see

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
between the two which is nice to see

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:46.279 
between the two which is nice to see
it's<00:00:45.329> one<00:00:45.420> of<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.570> few<00:00:45.750> that<00:00:45.870> I've<00:00:45.989> seen<00:00:46.140> like

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
it's one of the few that I've seen like

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.709 
it's one of the few that I've seen like
that<00:00:46.500> the<00:00:47.039> range<00:00:47.280> is<00:00:47.520> decent<00:00:47.969> stability<00:00:48.480> and

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
that the range is decent stability and

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.840 
that the range is decent stability and
reload<00:00:49.110> are<00:00:49.260> also<00:00:49.440> okay<00:00:50.039> looking<00:00:50.730> at<00:00:50.789> the

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
reload are also okay looking at the

that explosion right there it happened

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.200 
that explosion right there it happened
to<00:02:47.860> get<00:02:48.010> it<00:02:48.160> doesn't<00:02:48.520> happen<00:02:48.670> all<00:02:49.030> the<00:02:49.060> time

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:49.210 
to get it doesn't happen all the time

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:51.780 
to get it doesn't happen all the time
but<00:02:49.630> it<00:02:50.140> is<00:02:50.290> a<00:02:50.320> hidden<00:02:50.740> effect<00:02:51.280> of<00:02:51.400> this<00:02:51.550> gun

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
but it is a hidden effect of this gun

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.820 
but it is a hidden effect of this gun
and<00:02:52.510> I<00:02:52.570> only<00:02:52.930> notice<00:02:53.230> it<00:02:53.350> after<00:02:53.620> I<00:02:53.650> got

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
and I only notice it after I got

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:55.500 
and I only notice it after I got
lightning<00:02:54.130> ground<00:02:54.460> so<00:02:54.640> I<00:02:54.670> think<00:02:54.760> it<00:02:55.060> has<00:02:55.240> to<00:02:55.270> do

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 
lightning ground so I think it has to do

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:56.940 
lightning ground so I think it has to do
with<00:02:55.630> lightning<00:02:55.930> rounds<00:02:56.170> i'm<00:02:56.320> not<00:02:56.530> sure<00:02:56.740> the

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
with lightning rounds i'm not sure the

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:58.920 
with lightning rounds i'm not sure the
exact<00:02:57.280> chance<00:02:57.580> it<00:02:58.180> seems<00:02:58.390> anywhere<00:02:58.780> between

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
exact chance it seems anywhere between

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.580 
exact chance it seems anywhere between
every<00:02:59.590> other<00:02:59.890> to<00:03:00.340> every<00:03:01.000> five<00:03:01.390> kills<00:03:01.780> you<00:03:02.410> get

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
every other to every five kills you get

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:04.530 
every other to every five kills you get
kind<00:03:02.950> of<00:03:02.980> like<00:03:03.070> this<00:03:03.220> static<00:03:03.700> explosion<00:03:04.420> that

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
kind of like this static explosion that

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.170 
kind of like this static explosion that
deals<00:03:04.810> damage<00:03:05.020> to<00:03:05.200> nearby<00:03:05.620> enemies<00:03:06.280> which

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
deals damage to nearby enemies which

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.090 
deals damage to nearby enemies which
from<00:03:07.570> the<00:03:07.660> target<00:03:07.870> that<00:03:08.080> you<00:03:08.170> killed<00:03:08.410> which<00:03:09.010> is

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:09.100 
from the target that you killed which is

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.280 
from the target that you killed which is
really<00:03:09.250> cool<00:03:09.720> I'm<00:03:10.720> really<00:03:10.900> really<00:03:11.200> really

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
really cool I'm really really really

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.370 
really cool I'm really really really
cool<00:03:11.710> for<00:03:12.070> a<00:03:12.130> gun<00:03:12.310> to<00:03:12.430> have<00:03:12.610> and<00:03:13.140> there<00:03:14.140> it<00:03:14.260> is

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
cool for a gun to have and there it is

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.260 
cool for a gun to have and there it is
again<00:03:14.560> the<00:03:15.100> thing<00:03:15.340> that<00:03:15.520> I<00:03:15.610> like<00:03:15.790> about<00:03:15.850> it<00:03:16.090> is

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:16.270 
again the thing that I like about it is

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:18.270 
again the thing that I like about it is
that<00:03:16.300> it<00:03:16.660> doesn't<00:03:17.020> say<00:03:17.260> it<00:03:17.410> though<00:03:17.590> so<00:03:17.830> it<00:03:17.980> was

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
that it doesn't say it though so it was

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.560 
that it doesn't say it though so it was
hidden<00:03:18.459> and<00:03:18.670> I<00:03:18.760> started<00:03:19.060> noticing<00:03:19.090> and<00:03:19.450> I<00:03:19.480> was

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:19.570 
hidden and I started noticing and I was

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:20.790 
hidden and I started noticing and I was
like<00:03:19.660> what<00:03:19.780> the<00:03:19.810> hell<00:03:20.020> is<00:03:20.320> making<00:03:20.709> this

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:20.800 
like what the hell is making this

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.740 
like what the hell is making this
explosion<00:03:21.220> I'm<00:03:21.970> not<00:03:22.150> really<00:03:22.270> sure<00:03:22.420> what's

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:22.750 
explosion I'm not really sure what's

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:24.300 
explosion I'm not really sure what's
causing<00:03:22.930> this<00:03:23.290> explosion<00:03:23.680> but<00:03:23.980> it's<00:03:24.130> damn

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 
causing this explosion but it's damn

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:25.920 
causing this explosion but it's damn
cool<00:03:24.580> making<00:03:24.850> this<00:03:24.970> gun<00:03:25.180> even<00:03:25.420> better<00:03:25.690> and

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:25.930 
cool making this gun even better and

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:27.870 
cool making this gun even better and
even<00:03:26.740> a<00:03:26.800> little<00:03:26.920> bit<00:03:27.010> more<00:03:27.190> powerful<00:03:27.700> than<00:03:27.820> its

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:27.880 
even a little bit more powerful than its

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:32.160 
even a little bit more powerful than its
like<00:03:28.360> sheet<00:03:29.230> of<00:03:29.440> damage<00:03:30.190> per<00:03:30.220> se<00:03:30.610> and<00:03:31.170> that

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:32.170 
like sheet of damage per se and that

00:03:32.170 --> 00:03:33.480 
like sheet of damage per se and that
that's<00:03:32.410> one<00:03:32.740> thing<00:03:32.860> I<00:03:32.980> really<00:03:33.220> wanted<00:03:33.400> to

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:33.490 
that's one thing I really wanted to

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:34.980 
that's one thing I really wanted to
mention<00:03:33.640> with<00:03:33.880> it<00:03:34.000> now<00:03:34.120> there<00:03:34.600> was<00:03:34.780> another

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:34.990 
mention with it now there was another

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:36.540 
mention with it now there was another
perk<00:03:35.260> with<00:03:35.410> feeding<00:03:35.560> frenzy<00:03:35.950> longer<00:03:36.250> you<00:03:36.370> hold

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:36.550 
perk with feeding frenzy longer you hold

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:39.420 
perk with feeding frenzy longer you hold
down<00:03:36.730> the<00:03:36.880> fire<00:03:37.120> the<00:03:37.780> more<00:03:38.020> accurate<00:03:38.860> and<00:03:39.310> the

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:39.430 
down the fire the more accurate and the

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:42.060 
down the fire the more accurate and the
faster<00:03:39.820> gets<00:03:40.000> it<00:03:40.150> seems<00:03:40.390> like<00:03:40.540> every<00:03:41.070> around

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:42.070 
faster gets it seems like every around

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:45.180 
faster gets it seems like every around
16<00:03:42.700> to<00:03:42.910> 18<00:03:43.420> bullets<00:03:43.959> this<00:03:44.200> happened<00:03:44.590> so<00:03:44.800> let<00:03:45.100> me

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.190 
16 to 18 bullets this happened so let me

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:47.040 
16 to 18 bullets this happened so let me
show<00:03:45.310> that<00:03:45.459> off<00:03:45.580> to<00:03:45.730> you<00:03:45.790> this<00:03:45.940> has<00:03:46.120> a<00:03:46.150> Magus<00:03:46.780> 60

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:47.050 
show that off to you this has a Magus 60

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:48.360 
show that off to you this has a Magus 60
so<00:03:47.230> you<00:03:47.290> should<00:03:47.530> be<00:03:47.620> singing<00:03:47.830> it<00:03:48.040> speed

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 
so you should be singing it speed

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:50.550 
so you should be singing it speed
increase<00:03:48.640> around<00:03:48.910> 43<00:03:49.450> and<00:03:49.750> another<00:03:50.350> one

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:50.560 
increase around 43 and another one

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:53.130 
increase around 43 and another one
around<00:03:50.770> 20<00:03:51.400> is<00:03:51.610> what<00:03:51.940> I'm<00:03:52.030> thinking<00:03:52.420> here<00:03:52.630> so

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:53.140 
around 20 is what I'm thinking here so

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:54.570 
around 20 is what I'm thinking here so
let's<00:03:53.440> do<00:03:53.680> a<00:03:53.709> fire<00:03:53.950> right<00:03:54.100> and<00:03:54.250> let's<00:03:54.370> see<00:03:54.490> what

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:54.580 
let's do a fire right and let's see what

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:57.640 
let's do a fire right and let's see what
happens

00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:57.650 

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:02.080 

for<00:03:58.250> speed<00:03:58.519> increase<00:04:00.489> second<00:04:01.489> speed<00:04:01.730> increase

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:02.090 
for speed increase second speed increase

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:04.210 
for speed increase second speed increase
and<00:04:02.900> you<00:04:02.930> can<00:04:03.019> see<00:04:03.290> it's<00:04:03.530> shooting<00:04:03.829> pretty

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:04.220 
and you can see it's shooting pretty

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:07.119 
and you can see it's shooting pretty
darn<00:04:04.400> fast<00:04:04.579> at<00:04:04.879> the<00:04:04.909> end<00:04:05.120> there<00:04:05.299> and<00:04:05.540> you<00:04:06.470> might

00:04:07.119 --> 00:04:07.129 
darn fast at the end there and you might

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:08.740 
darn fast at the end there and you might
want<00:04:07.430> that<00:04:07.579> or<00:04:07.790> you<00:04:07.879> might<00:04:08.000> not<00:04:08.180> depending<00:04:08.659> on

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:08.750 
want that or you might not depending on

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:09.940 
want that or you might not depending on
what<00:04:08.900> you're<00:04:09.019> fighting<00:04:09.200> if<00:04:09.439> you<00:04:09.560> just<00:04:09.769> need<00:04:09.860> to

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:09.950 
what you're fighting if you just need to

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:11.380 
what you're fighting if you just need to
get<00:04:10.040> a<00:04:10.099> lot<00:04:10.310> of<00:04:10.340> rounds<00:04:10.549> into<00:04:10.790> something<00:04:11.209> very

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:11.390 
get a lot of rounds into something very

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:13.420 
get a lot of rounds into something very
quickly<00:04:11.629> this<00:04:11.900> gun<00:04:12.170> excels<00:04:12.799> at<00:04:13.010> that<00:04:13.129> because

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:13.430 
quickly this gun excels at that because

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:15.369 
quickly this gun excels at that because
of<00:04:13.519> that<00:04:13.640> reason<00:04:13.670> if<00:04:14.209> you're<00:04:14.750> looking<00:04:15.079> to<00:04:15.200> just

00:04:15.369 --> 00:04:15.379 
of that reason if you're looking to just

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:18.430 
of that reason if you're looking to just
pop<00:04:15.590> off<00:04:15.739> enemies<00:04:16.100> do<00:04:16.609> the<00:04:16.759> old<00:04:16.970> like<00:04:17.269> a<00:04:17.440> firing

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.440 
pop off enemies do the old like a firing

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:19.810 
pop off enemies do the old like a firing
technique<00:04:18.769> like<00:04:18.949> the<00:04:19.070> sniper<00:04:19.280> technique<00:04:19.669> just

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:19.820 
technique like the sniper technique just

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:23.980 
technique like the sniper technique just
one<00:04:20.000> two<00:04:20.829> one<00:04:21.829> two<00:04:21.940> you<00:04:22.940> know<00:04:23.060> just<00:04:23.449> make<00:04:23.960> sure

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:23.990 
one two one two you know just make sure

00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:25.779 
one two one two you know just make sure
you<00:04:24.110> have<00:04:24.410> controlled<00:04:24.830> rounds<00:04:25.190> and<00:04:25.340> this<00:04:25.520> gun

00:04:25.779 --> 00:04:25.789 
you have controlled rounds and this gun

00:04:25.789 --> 00:04:28.029 
you have controlled rounds and this gun
can<00:04:26.060> work<00:04:26.210> both<00:04:26.389> ways<00:04:26.449> as<00:04:26.900> crowd<00:04:27.169> control<00:04:27.500> or

00:04:28.029 --> 00:04:28.039 
can work both ways as crowd control or

00:04:28.039 --> 00:04:31.090 
can work both ways as crowd control or
just<00:04:28.400> picking<00:04:28.699> things<00:04:29.270> off<00:04:29.600> a<00:04:29.630> far<00:04:30.139> and<00:04:30.500> away

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:31.100 
just picking things off a far and away

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:33.040 
just picking things off a far and away
from<00:04:31.400> each<00:04:31.490> other<00:04:31.610> so<00:04:31.970> those<00:04:32.660> are<00:04:32.810> some<00:04:32.870> things

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:33.050 
from each other so those are some things

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:34.330 
from each other so those are some things
to<00:04:33.169> look<00:04:33.289> at<00:04:33.470> with<00:04:33.590> this<00:04:33.740> gun<00:04:33.919> overall<00:04:34.250> I

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:34.340 
to look at with this gun overall I

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:37.210 
to look at with this gun overall I
really<00:04:34.520> like<00:04:35.030> it<00:04:35.240> for<00:04:35.419> an<00:04:36.050> exotic<00:04:36.560> heavy<00:04:36.860> it's

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:37.220 
really like it for an exotic heavy it's

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:42.520 
really like it for an exotic heavy it's
pretty<00:04:37.729> much<00:04:37.970> the<00:04:38.510> best<00:04:39.910> you<00:04:40.910> can<00:04:41.030> get<00:04:41.530> and

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:09.590 
research as I could on it didn't really

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:11.379
