00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.770 
it's it's an extremely dangerous sport
and<00:01:49.040> so<00:01:49.280> it's<00:01:49.490> great<00:01:49.670> that<00:01:49.790> that<00:01:50.600> they're

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
and so it's great that that they're

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:51.600 
and so it's great that that they're
making<00:01:51.140> them<00:01:51.320> were

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:51.610
