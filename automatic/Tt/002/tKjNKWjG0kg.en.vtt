00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:37.760
 medium is almost half small medium 

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:40.099

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:53.150
 because it is but I am not here 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:56.349
 to hold it is better to be two 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.349
 for maneuver here 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:12.920
 no alas is laying on the ground so if one is 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:16.209
 two is always better too 

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.209
 deflates more easily 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:32.450
 First, it is better to flatten this bah 

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:35.150

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:37.600

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:57.590

00:03:50.330 --> 00:04:00.440
 kiki that's it, we 'll wait for that 

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:02.739
