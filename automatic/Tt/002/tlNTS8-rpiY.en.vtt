00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
and art was what I did to sort of

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.229 
and art was what I did to sort of
decompress<00:00:36.590> and<00:00:37.590> so<00:00:38.040> I<00:00:38.370> went<00:00:38.820> and<00:00:39.000> I<00:00:39.059> did<00:00:39.210> a

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
it was just for myself it really didn't

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.180 
it was just for myself it really didn't
have<00:00:44.790> any<00:00:45.140> great<00:00:46.140> importance<00:00:46.770> other<00:00:46.949> than

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
have any great importance other than

have any great importance other than
self-satisfaction<00:00:48.060> it<00:00:48.450> made<00:00:48.720> me<00:00:48.870> feel<00:00:49.079> good

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
self-satisfaction it made me feel good

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.639 
self-satisfaction it made me feel good
to<00:00:49.590> do<00:00:49.710> it<00:00:49.829> and<00:00:50.120> in<00:00:51.120> two<00:00:51.750> thousand<00:00:52.290> when<00:00:52.620> I

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
to do it and in two thousand when I

traveling<00:01:00.270> some<00:01:00.510> and<00:01:00.870> I<00:01:00.989> saw<00:01:01.260> things<00:01:01.590> and

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:02.420 
traveling some and I saw things and

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:07.969 
traveling some and I saw things and
imagined<00:01:03.420> images<00:01:05.690> that<00:01:06.690> just<00:01:07.229> spoke<00:01:07.500> to<00:01:07.530> me<00:01:07.800> I

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
imagined images that just spoke to me I

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.480 
imagined images that just spoke to me I
saw<00:01:08.460> things<00:01:08.700> and<00:01:09.200> thought<00:01:10.200> oh<00:01:10.410> I<00:01:10.860> need<00:01:11.190> to<00:01:11.340> do

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
saw things and thought oh I need to do

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.710 
saw things and thought oh I need to do
something<00:01:11.759> with<00:01:11.970> that<00:01:13.610> so<00:01:14.610> my<00:01:14.880> art<00:01:15.119> just<00:01:15.420> began

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
something with that so my art just began

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.200 
something with that so my art just began
sort<00:01:16.560> of<00:01:16.680> for<00:01:16.979> me<00:01:17.070> all<00:01:17.250> over<00:01:17.280> again<00:01:17.670> when<00:01:18.149> I

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
sort of for me all over again when I

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.380 
sort of for me all over again when I
started<00:01:18.690> taking<00:01:18.899> it<00:01:19.200> seriously<00:01:19.760> and<00:01:20.760> I

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
started taking it seriously and I

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.120 
started taking it seriously and I
thought<00:01:21.659> whatever<00:01:22.049> you<00:01:22.320> think<00:01:22.590> you<00:01:22.650> know<00:01:22.890> when

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
thought whatever you think you know when

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.410 
thought whatever you think you know when
you<00:01:23.250> start<00:01:25.310> changes<00:01:26.310> every<00:01:26.549> day<00:01:26.580> and<00:01:26.940> every

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
you start changes every day and every

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.260 
you start changes every day and every
five<00:01:27.960> years<00:01:28.250> so<00:01:29.250> i<00:01:29.280> can<00:01:29.610> only<00:01:29.700> say<00:01:29.970> that<00:01:30.000> what<00:01:30.240> i

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
five years so i can only say that what i

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.660 
five years so i can only say that what i
thought<00:01:30.630> i<00:01:30.840> knew<00:01:30.990> how<00:01:31.140> to<00:01:31.200> do<00:01:31.470> ten<00:01:32.310> years<00:01:32.520> ago

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
thought i knew how to do ten years ago

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.960 
thought i knew how to do ten years ago
is<00:01:33.350> only<00:01:34.350> compounded<00:01:35.250> by<00:01:35.430> what<00:01:35.640> i<00:01:35.670> know<00:01:35.820> now

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
is only compounded by what i know now

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.200 
is only compounded by what i know now
and<00:01:36.479> will<00:01:36.630> be<00:01:36.659> compounded<00:01:37.260> by<00:01:37.380> more<00:01:38.000> 10<00:01:39.000> years

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
and will be compounded by more 10 years

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.160 
and will be compounded by more 10 years
from<00:01:39.330> now<00:01:39.420> so<00:01:40.310> it<00:01:41.310> evolved<00:01:41.939> every<00:01:42.210> day<00:01:42.360> what<00:01:43.140> I

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
from now so it evolved every day what I

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.310 
from now so it evolved every day what I
see<00:01:43.580> translates<00:01:44.580> into<00:01:44.880> what<00:01:45.390> I<00:01:45.420> paint<00:01:45.810> and<00:01:46.049> the

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
see translates into what I paint and the

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.590 
see translates into what I paint and the
colors<00:01:46.680> especially<00:01:46.950> as<00:01:47.430> they<00:01:48.119> change<00:01:48.360> through

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
colors especially as they change through

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.899 
colors especially as they change through
the<00:01:48.720> year<00:01:48.900> change<00:01:49.290> in<00:01:49.920> my<00:01:50.280> paintings<00:01:50.700> though

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909 
the year change in my paintings though

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.940 
the year change in my paintings though
it<00:01:51.420> does<00:01:51.659> change<00:01:51.900> every<00:01:52.380> day<00:01:53.570> my<00:01:54.570> garden<00:01:54.990> is<00:01:55.140> my

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
it does change every day my garden is my

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.249 
it does change every day my garden is my
strongest<00:01:56.280> influence<00:01:56.670> I<00:01:57.180> think<00:01:57.420> Gardens

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
strongest influence I think Gardens

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.800 
strongest influence I think Gardens
change<00:01:58.619> every<00:01:58.920> day<00:01:59.040> so<00:01:59.610> you<00:01:59.670> can<00:01:59.850> walk<00:02:00.630> out

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
change every day so you can walk out

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.100 
change every day so you can walk out
into<00:02:01.049> the<00:02:01.229> garden<00:02:01.380> and<00:02:01.740> one<00:02:02.729> day<00:02:02.939> it<00:02:03.240> actually

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
into the garden and one day it actually

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.219 
into the garden and one day it actually
looks<00:02:05.009> like<00:02:05.250> everything's<00:02:05.759> under<00:02:05.970> glass<00:02:06.930> bead

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
looks like everything's under glass bead

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.249 
looks like everything's under glass bead
gel<00:02:07.500> because<00:02:07.770> it<00:02:08.670> has<00:02:08.880> little<00:02:09.209> dew<00:02:09.750> drops<00:02:10.049> all

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
gel because it has little dew drops all

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.870 
gel because it has little dew drops all
over<00:02:10.440> the<00:02:10.560> top<00:02:10.709> of<00:02:10.739> it<00:02:10.950> and<00:02:11.100> that<00:02:11.130> inspires<00:02:11.700> me

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:11.880 
over the top of it and that inspires me

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.910 
over the top of it and that inspires me
to<00:02:11.910> go<00:02:12.090> in<00:02:12.239> play<00:02:12.660> with<00:02:12.840> glass<00:02:13.079> bead<00:02:13.320> gel<00:02:13.530> or<00:02:13.560> one

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
to go in play with glass bead gel or one

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.640 
to go in play with glass bead gel or one
day<00:02:14.160> the<00:02:14.640> irises<00:02:14.970> bloom<00:02:15.360> and<00:02:15.570> I<00:02:15.630> see<00:02:15.959> so

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
day the irises bloom and I see so

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.420 
day the irises bloom and I see so
clearly<00:02:18.079> the<00:02:19.079> forms<00:02:19.590> and<00:02:19.799> shapes<00:02:20.070> in<00:02:20.400> the

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
clearly the forms and shapes in the

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.259 
clearly the forms and shapes in the
flowers<00:02:21.000> one<00:02:21.810> day<00:02:22.019> the<00:02:22.380> bees<00:02:22.650> are<00:02:23.120> creating<00:02:24.120> a

00:02:24.259 --> 00:02:24.269 
flowers one day the bees are creating a

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:27.349 
flowers one day the bees are creating a
fervor<00:02:25.049> around<00:02:25.560> my<00:02:26.370> fennel<00:02:26.850> plants<00:02:27.239> when

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:27.359 
fervor around my fennel plants when

00:02:27.359 --> 00:02:27.620 
fervor around my fennel plants when
there

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:27.630 
there

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.980 
there
and<00:02:28.020> I<00:02:28.080> think<00:02:28.460> it's<00:02:29.460> almost<00:02:29.640> like<00:02:29.940> confetti<00:02:30.720> in

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
and I think it's almost like confetti in

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:33.470 
and I think it's almost like confetti in
the<00:02:31.050> air<00:02:31.620> and<00:02:32.010> it<00:02:32.520> makes<00:02:32.700> me<00:02:32.880> want<00:02:33.060> to<00:02:33.150> go<00:02:33.300> in

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
the air and it makes me want to go in

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.960 
the air and it makes me want to go in
and<00:02:33.630> do<00:02:33.890> some<00:02:34.890> kind<00:02:35.100> of<00:02:35.160> stenciling<00:02:35.700> I<00:02:35.820> mean

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
and do some kind of stenciling I mean

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.300 
and do some kind of stenciling I mean
it's<00:02:36.300> all<00:02:36.540> about<00:02:37.110> the<00:02:37.320> color<00:02:37.590> and<00:02:37.860> the<00:02:37.890> pattern

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
it's all about the color and the pattern

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.130 
it's all about the color and the pattern
that<00:02:38.460> you<00:02:38.610> run<00:02:38.880> into<00:02:39.060> every<00:02:39.420> day<00:02:39.720> when<00:02:39.990> you're

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
that you run into every day when you're

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.650 
that you run into every day when you're
walking<00:02:40.470> through<00:02:40.680> the<00:02:40.920> garden<00:02:41.040> so<00:02:41.490> that's<00:02:42.420> one

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:42.660 
walking through the garden so that's one

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:44.300 
walking through the garden so that's one
of<00:02:42.750> my<00:02:42.810> biggest<00:02:43.020> inspiration<00:02:43.740> travel<00:02:44.190> is

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310 
of my biggest inspiration travel is

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.150 
of my biggest inspiration travel is
another<00:02:44.580> I<00:02:45.480> can<00:02:46.290> see<00:02:46.530> something<00:02:46.950> that's

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
another I can see something that's

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:49.850 
another I can see something that's
magical<00:02:47.850> and<00:02:48.060> want<00:02:48.660> to<00:02:48.750> come<00:02:48.930> back<00:02:49.080> and<00:02:49.380> live

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
magical and want to come back and live

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.860 
magical and want to come back and live
it<00:02:49.980> again<00:02:50.100> and<00:02:50.490> I<00:02:50.670> can<00:02:50.850> do<00:02:51.000> that<00:02:51.150> with<00:02:51.300> my<00:02:51.330> art<00:02:51.630> I

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:51.870 
it again and I can do that with my art I

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.230 
it again and I can do that with my art I
don't<00:02:52.860> start<00:02:53.190> with<00:02:53.340> a<00:02:53.370> plan<00:02:53.670> for<00:02:53.970> the<00:02:54.060> most

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:54.240 
don't start with a plan for the most

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:55.700 
don't start with a plan for the most
part<00:02:54.420> unless<00:02:54.600> it's<00:02:54.960> a<00:02:55.050> commission<00:02:55.530> that

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:55.710 
part unless it's a commission that

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:57.770 
part unless it's a commission that
somebody<00:02:56.160> says<00:02:56.370> to<00:02:56.520> me<00:02:56.640> I<00:02:56.670> want<00:02:57.090> you<00:02:57.180> to<00:02:57.570> paint

this<00:02:58.170> in<00:02:58.440> these<00:02:58.980> colors<00:02:59.460> then<00:03:00.210> the<00:03:00.420> plan<00:03:00.660> is

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:00.830 
this in these colors then the plan is

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:03.230 
this in these colors then the plan is
literally<00:03:01.830> to<00:03:02.010> start<00:03:02.430> with<00:03:02.700> something<00:03:02.910> that<00:03:03.090> I

I don't plan it in advance it plans me

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.920 
I don't plan it in advance it plans me
if<00:03:17.460> you're<00:03:17.700> just<00:03:17.880> starting<00:03:17.970> out<00:03:18.330> in<00:03:18.390> acrylics

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
if you're just starting out in acrylics

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:21.800 
if you're just starting out in acrylics
and<00:03:19.050> you<00:03:19.200> think<00:03:19.530> what<00:03:20.160> do<00:03:20.280> I<00:03:20.400> really<00:03:20.430> need<00:03:21.210> to

get started you first have to start with

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.970 
get started you first have to start with
color<00:03:24.000> and<00:03:24.240> you<00:03:24.870> have<00:03:25.080> to<00:03:25.260> start<00:03:25.440> with<00:03:25.530> colors

purchase the ones that are made from the

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.240 
purchase the ones that are made from the
chemistry<00:03:41.100> lab<00:03:41.250> I<00:03:42.030> would<00:03:42.630> look<00:03:43.620> in<00:03:43.830> my<00:03:44.010> book

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:44.250 
chemistry lab I would look in my book

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.250 
chemistry lab I would look in my book
acrylic<00:03:44.730> solutions<00:03:45.180> and<00:03:45.510> you'll<00:03:45.870> find<00:03:46.140> a

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
acrylic solutions and you'll find a

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.660 
acrylic solutions and you'll find a
great<00:03:46.440> list<00:03:46.710> I<00:03:46.890> think<00:03:47.100> I<00:03:47.930> offer<00:03:48.930> three

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:49.670 
great list I think I offer three

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:52.340 
great list I think I offer three
variations<00:03:50.670> on<00:03:51.240> a<00:03:51.270> red<00:03:51.570> blue<00:03:51.780> yellow<00:03:51.810> that

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350 
variations on a red blue yellow that

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:54.560 
variations on a red blue yellow that
will<00:03:52.500> give<00:03:52.710> you<00:03:52.890> that<00:03:53.280> and<00:03:53.610> then<00:03:54.150> you<00:03:54.300> want<00:03:54.480> to

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:54.570 
will give you that and then you want to

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:56.990 
will give you that and then you want to
purchase<00:03:54.750> a<00:03:55.200> couple<00:03:55.680> of<00:03:55.800> products<00:03:56.310> certainly

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
purchase a couple of products certainly

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.640 
purchase a couple of products certainly
you<00:03:57.120> need<00:03:57.360> a<00:03:58.190> medium<00:03:59.390> and<00:04:00.390> acrylic<00:04:01.230> glazing

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:01.650 
you need a medium and acrylic glazing

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:03.199 
you need a medium and acrylic glazing
liquid<00:04:01.950> which<00:04:02.250> i<00:04:02.490> think<00:04:02.550> is<00:04:02.970> absolutely

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:03.209 
liquid which i think is absolutely

00:04:03.209 --> 00:04:05.360 
liquid which i think is absolutely
essential<00:04:03.959> for<00:04:04.200> learning<00:04:04.740> to<00:04:04.890> paint<00:04:05.070> because

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.370 
essential for learning to paint because

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.699 
essential for learning to paint because

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:09.209 
especially if you're in very warm

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:10.850 
especially if you're in very warm
climates<00:04:09.690> and<00:04:09.780> your<00:04:09.930> paint<00:04:10.200> dries<00:04:10.470> up<00:04:10.650> very

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:10.860 
climates and your paint dries up very

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:13.940 
climates and your paint dries up very
fast<00:04:11.070> that<00:04:11.940> will<00:04:12.180> help<00:04:12.420> you<00:04:12.630> extend<00:04:13.110> the<00:04:13.620> life

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950 
fast that will help you extend the life

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:16.760 
fast that will help you extend the life
of<00:04:14.130> your<00:04:14.190> paints<00:04:14.670> as<00:04:15.570> far<00:04:15.990> as<00:04:16.080> another<00:04:16.350> medium

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:16.770 
of your paints as far as another medium

00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:19.760 
of your paints as far as another medium
I<00:04:16.980> would<00:04:17.790> say<00:04:17.940> you<00:04:18.000> need<00:04:18.299> a<00:04:18.690> soft<00:04:19.350> gel<00:04:19.620> is

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:19.770 
I would say you need a soft gel is

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:22.610 
I would say you need a soft gel is
always<00:04:20.160> good<00:04:20.480> because<00:04:21.480> it<00:04:21.900> can<00:04:22.140> be<00:04:22.260> used<00:04:22.410> as<00:04:22.560> a

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:22.620 
always good because it can be used as a

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.160 
always good because it can be used as a
collage<00:04:23.040> glue<00:04:23.460> or<00:04:23.790> it<00:04:24.150> can<00:04:24.300> be<00:04:24.420> used<00:04:24.600> to<00:04:24.870> create

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:25.170 
collage glue or it can be used to create
