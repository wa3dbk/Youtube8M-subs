00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.550 
of Jack and the Beanstalk and it does
well<00:01:53.399> for<00:01:53.640> the<00:01:53.700> most<00:01:53.939> part<00:01:54.060> but<00:01:54.600> it<00:01:54.840> is<00:01:55.140> kind<00:01:55.470> of

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:55.560 
well for the most part but it is kind of

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.130 
well for the most part but it is kind of
shallow<00:01:55.829> it<00:01:56.250> lacks<00:01:56.790> depth<00:01:57.180> and<00:01:57.420> character<00:01:57.689> and

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
shallow it lacks depth and character and

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.270 
shallow it lacks depth and character and
it<00:01:58.320> could<00:01:58.469> have<00:01:58.560> used<00:01:58.590> a<00:01:58.770> punch-up<00:01:59.070> on<00:01:59.219> the

00:01:59.270 --> 00:01:59.280 
it could have used a punch-up on the

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.010 
it could have used a punch-up on the
script<00:01:59.610> which<00:02:00.030> is<00:02:00.210> just<00:02:00.450> not<00:02:00.600> there<00:02:00.810> those

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
script which is just not there those

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.240 
script which is just not there those
things<00:02:01.259> would<00:02:01.380> have<00:02:01.469> make<00:02:01.590> it<00:02:01.710> memorable

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
things would have make it memorable

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.249 
things would have make it memorable
it's<00:02:02.610> a<00:02:02.729> likeable<00:02:03.149> enough<00:02:03.180> movie<00:02:03.689> but<00:02:04.170> the

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:04.259 
it's a likeable enough movie but the

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.410 
it's a likeable enough movie but the
humor<00:02:04.590> skews<00:02:04.890> a<00:02:04.920> little<00:02:05.310> bit<00:02:05.430> too<00:02:05.729> young<00:02:05.759> with

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
humor skews a little bit too young with

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.359 
humor skews a little bit too young with
all<00:02:06.570> the<00:02:06.689> farting<00:02:07.049> giants<00:02:07.560> I<00:02:07.680> would<00:02:08.099> just<00:02:08.190> give

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
all the farting giants I would just give

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:09.499 
all the farting giants I would just give
it<00:02:08.520> kind<00:02:09.000> of<00:02:09.090> a<00:02:09.179> low

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
problem here is that this film just

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:15.350 
problem here is that this film just
