00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:14.710 
Wii U version that I created on the new

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:18.360 
Wii U version that I created on the new
3ds<00:04:15.989> the<00:04:16.989> last<00:04:17.200> thing<00:04:17.410> I<00:04:17.530> wanted<00:04:17.800> to<00:04:17.920> compare

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:18.370 
3ds the last thing I wanted to compare

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:22.680 
3ds the last thing I wanted to compare
in<00:04:18.640> both<00:04:19.090> systems<00:04:19.390> is<00:04:19.930> the<00:04:20.350> speed<00:04:20.890> of<00:04:21.130> the<00:04:21.690> NFC

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:22.690 
in both systems is the speed of the NFC

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:25.920 
in both systems is the speed of the NFC
card<00:04:22.990> reader<00:04:23.740> so<00:04:24.090> we'll<00:04:25.090> check<00:04:25.330> out<00:04:25.540> which

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:25.930 
card reader so we'll check out which

system reads the amiibo the fastest I

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:36.600
