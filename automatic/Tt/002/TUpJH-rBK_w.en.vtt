00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
the bases loaded with one out we can do

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:10.590 
the bases loaded with one out we can do
some<00:02:09.000> damage<00:02:09.030> right<00:02:09.509> here<00:02:09.569> grandeur

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:10.600 
some damage right here grandeur

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.470

double<00:02:14.080> play<00:02:14.110> just<00:02:14.980> like<00:02:15.310> that<00:02:15.610> so<00:02:15.910> my<00:02:16.120> first

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
double play just like that so my first

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:17.970 
double play just like that so my first
two<00:02:16.540> at-bats<00:02:16.690> couldn't<00:02:17.350> have<00:02:17.440> gone<00:02:17.590> any

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
two at-bats couldn't have gone any

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.490 
two at-bats couldn't have gone any
better<00:02:18.580> so<00:02:19.030> hopefully<00:02:19.450> third<00:02:19.990> time's<00:02:20.290> a<00:02:20.470> charm

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:20.500

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:12.130 
here or a run wins it can we actually

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:14.160 
here or a run wins it can we actually
impress<00:05:12.610> the<00:05:12.730> scouts<00:05:12.850> by<00:05:13.270> being<00:05:13.630> clutch<00:05:13.960> and

00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:14.170 
impress the scouts by being clutch and

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:19.060 
first pitch swinging and maybe we can

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:22.140 
first pitch swinging and maybe we can
score<00:05:19.420> the<00:05:19.690> game-winning<00:05:20.340> run<00:05:21.340> so<00:05:21.910> I'm<00:05:22.000> the
