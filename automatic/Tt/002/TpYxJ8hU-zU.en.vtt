his special moves are quite interesting

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:44.740 
his special moves are quite interesting
as<00:01:42.500> well<00:01:42.789> he's<00:01:43.789> got<00:01:44.000> what<00:01:44.179> we<00:01:44.270> call<00:01:44.390> a<00:01:44.450> wrecker

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:44.750 
as well he's got what we call a wrecker

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:47.319 
as well he's got what we call a wrecker
style<00:01:45.170> of<00:01:45.320> attack<00:01:45.409> which<00:01:46.130> means<00:01:46.369> you<00:01:46.969> can<00:01:47.149> do

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:47.329 
style of attack which means you can do

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:49.870 
style of attack which means you can do
multiple<00:01:47.600> hits<00:01:48.079> one<00:01:48.350> after<00:01:48.619> the<00:01:48.740> other<00:01:48.789> so<00:01:49.789> the

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
multiple hits one after the other so the

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.279 
multiple hits one after the other so the
idea<00:01:50.210> is<00:01:50.329> that<00:01:50.360> when<00:01:50.600> you<00:01:50.689> see<00:01:50.869> this<00:01:51.049> move

00:01:51.279 --> 00:01:51.289 
idea is that when you see this move

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:53.020 
idea is that when you see this move
hitting<00:01:51.649> this<00:01:51.860> is<00:01:51.950> called<00:01:52.130> Patriot<00:01:52.610> circle

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:53.030 
hitting this is called Patriot circle

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.059

which<00:02:23.770> is<00:02:23.860> quite<00:02:24.070> useful<00:02:24.220> because<00:02:24.520> you<00:02:24.940> start

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
which is quite useful because you start

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.330 
which is quite useful because you start
the<00:02:25.600> move<00:02:25.750> by<00:02:25.960> doing<00:02:26.260> a<00:02:26.410> dragon<00:02:26.620> punch<00:02:26.890> motion

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:27.340

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
and pressing kick and from there you can

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:30.780 
and pressing kick and from there you can
actually<00:02:29.740> choose<00:02:29.920> whether<00:02:30.160> you<00:02:30.250> press<00:02:30.520> punch

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:30.790 
actually choose whether you press punch

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.660 
actually choose whether you press punch
or<00:02:31.000> not<00:02:31.380> pressing<00:02:32.380> punch<00:02:32.740> releases<00:02:33.340> the<00:02:33.460> knife

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
or not pressing punch releases the knife

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.970 
or not pressing punch releases the knife
attack<00:02:34.050> it's<00:02:35.050> just<00:02:35.200> another<00:02:35.410> move<00:02:35.680> to<00:02:35.860> read

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
attack it's just another move to read

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:37.260 
attack it's just another move to read
frustrate<00:02:36.400> your<00:02:36.520> partner<00:02:36.820> who's<00:02:37.030> going<00:02:37.150> to<00:02:37.210> be

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:37.270 
frustrate your partner who's going to be

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:38.370

trying<00:02:37.480> to<00:02:37.540> get<00:02:37.630> close<00:02:37.870> to<00:02:37.900> you

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
trying to get close to you

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:39.810 
trying to get close to you
where's<00:02:38.890> you're<00:02:39.190> going<00:02:39.340> to<00:02:39.400> be<00:02:39.460> trying<00:02:39.640> to<00:02:39.670> run

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:39.820 
where's you're going to be trying to run

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:43.020 
where's you're going to be trying to run
away<00:02:40.710> and<00:02:41.710> keep<00:02:41.980> them<00:02:42.130> away<00:02:42.310> like<00:02:42.640> that<00:02:42.670> far

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
away and keep them away like that far

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.650 
away and keep them away like that far
distance

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
distance

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:45.450 
distance
so<00:02:44.590> this<00:02:44.770> is<00:02:44.890> going<00:02:45.010> to<00:02:45.070> be<00:02:45.130> a<00:02:45.160> move<00:02:45.310> that

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:45.460 
so this is going to be a move that

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:47.790 
so this is going to be a move that
really<00:02:45.640> frustrates<00:02:45.820> your<00:02:46.210> opponent<00:02:46.660> the<00:02:47.530> e<00:02:47.560> X

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 
really frustrates your opponent the e X

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.470 
really frustrates your opponent the e X
version<00:02:48.310> can<00:02:48.460> actually<00:02:48.700> be<00:02:48.820> used<00:02:49.000> in<00:02:49.150> combos

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
version can actually be used in combos

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:53.320 
version can actually be used in combos
as<00:02:49.720> well<00:02:49.870> much<00:02:50.380> like<00:02:50.560> this

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:53.330 

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:55.000 

and<00:02:53.510> from<00:02:53.630> here<00:02:53.810> you<00:02:53.990> can<00:02:54.140> seal<00:02:54.350> and<00:02:54.500> his<00:02:54.650> ultra

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.010 
and from here you can seal and his ultra

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.230 
and from here you can seal and his ultra
once<00:02:55.480> ultra<00:02:56.480> one<00:02:56.660> combo<00:02:57.850> actually<00:02:58.850> lands

00:02:59.230 --> 00:02:59.240 
once ultra one combo actually lands

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:02.830 
once ultra one combo actually lands
almost<00:02:59.390> after<00:02:59.900> every<00:03:00.170> juggle<00:03:00.560> juggle<00:03:01.840> every

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
almost after every juggle juggle every

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.030 
almost after every juggle juggle every
time<00:03:03.020> your<00:03:03.170> opponent's<00:03:03.530> in<00:03:03.620> juggle<00:03:03.950> state

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.040 
time your opponent's in juggle state

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.580 
time your opponent's in juggle state
degree<00:03:04.520> much<00:03:04.670> land<00:03:04.910> ultra<00:03:05.270> one<00:03:05.420> so<00:03:06.230> let's<00:03:06.410> take

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:06.590 
degree much land ultra one so let's take

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:08.680 
degree much land ultra one so let's take
a<00:03:06.620> look<00:03:06.770> at<00:03:06.950> relent<00:03:07.370> owes<00:03:07.520> ultra<00:03:07.970> ones<00:03:08.150> is<00:03:08.390> also

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 
a look at relent owes ultra ones is also

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:11.110 
a look at relent owes ultra ones is also
combo<00:03:08.960> one<00:03:09.140> I<00:03:09.290> need<00:03:09.440> to<00:03:09.560> give<00:03:09.680> him<00:03:09.800> some<00:03:10.120> some

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
combo one I need to give him some some

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.660 
combo one I need to give him some some
quick<00:03:11.300> beatings

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.450 

so<00:03:16.300> religious<00:03:16.690> ultra<00:03:17.050> October<00:03:17.740> 1<00:03:17.950> is<00:03:18.190> actually

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:18.460 
so religious ultra October 1 is actually

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:20.220 
so religious ultra October 1 is actually
most<00:03:18.790> useful<00:03:19.240> for<00:03:19.390> the<00:03:19.450> fact<00:03:19.630> that<00:03:19.720> in

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
most useful for the fact that in

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:21.870 
most useful for the fact that in
conference<00:03:20.800> went<00:03:21.010> after<00:03:21.370> pretty<00:03:21.550> much<00:03:21.700> any

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:21.880 
conference went after pretty much any

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:23.280 
conference went after pretty much any
attack<00:03:22.209> that<00:03:22.390> leads<00:03:22.540> to<00:03:22.690> opponent<00:03:23.110> in<00:03:23.200> a

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:23.290 
attack that leads to opponent in a

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:25.590 
attack that leads to opponent in a
juggle<00:03:23.590> state<00:03:24.090> here's<00:03:25.090> one<00:03:25.270> really<00:03:25.510> good

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:25.600 
juggle state here's one really good

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:29.380 
juggle state here's one really good
example<00:03:25.990> of<00:03:26.020> that

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:29.390 

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:31.960 

so<00:03:29.960> I<00:03:29.990> use<00:03:30.170> the<00:03:30.320> e^x<00:03:30.620> knife<00:03:31.460> attack<00:03:31.790> they

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:31.970 
so I use the e^x knife attack they

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:33.790 
so I use the e^x knife attack they
showed<00:03:32.180> you<00:03:32.300> previously<00:03:32.480> puts<00:03:33.470> them<00:03:33.560> into<00:03:33.680> a

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:33.800 
showed you previously puts them into a

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:35.440 
showed you previously puts them into a
double<00:03:34.100> state<00:03:34.280> and<00:03:34.430> ultra<00:03:34.670> non<00:03:34.790> combos<00:03:35.150> after

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
double state and ultra non combos after

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:37.750 
double state and ultra non combos after
that<00:03:35.570> it<00:03:36.410> sounds<00:03:36.590> pretty<00:03:36.770> good<00:03:36.890> damage<00:03:37.040> even

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 
that it sounds pretty good damage even

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:39.160 
that it sounds pretty good damage even
though<00:03:37.880> I'm<00:03:38.000> using<00:03:38.210> odd<00:03:38.390> number<00:03:38.720> double<00:03:39.050> which

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:39.170 
though I'm using odd number double which

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:41.170 
though I'm using odd number double which
does<00:03:39.380> a<00:03:39.950> decrease<00:03:40.340> in<00:03:40.370> our<00:03:40.550> damage<00:03:40.910> having

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:41.180 
does a decrease in our damage having

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:42.910 
does a decrease in our damage having
access<00:03:41.420> to<00:03:41.480> low<00:03:41.660> Baltar's<00:03:42.080> I<00:03:42.350> really<00:03:42.740> want<00:03:42.860> to

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:42.920 
access to low Baltar's I really want to
