a<00:00:52.710> lazy<00:00:52.949> tire<00:00:53.400> who<00:00:53.670> doesn't<00:00:54.059> like<00:00:54.210> putting<00:00:54.629> the

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
a lazy tire who doesn't like putting the

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:57.009 
a lazy tire who doesn't like putting the
lid<00:00:54.960> backing<00:00:55.379> on<00:00:55.500> tightly<00:00:55.830> between<00:00:56.220> every<00:00:56.760> fly

00:00:57.009 --> 00:00:57.019
