00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:35.450 
just so you see some of the main

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.870 
just so you see some of the main
highways<00:02:35.870> actually<00:02:36.410> there<00:02:36.920> we<00:02:37.010> go<00:02:37.160> like<00:02:37.730> that

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
highways actually there we go like that

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.039 
highways actually there we go like that
and<00:02:38.170> the<00:02:39.170> custom<00:02:39.650> size<00:02:39.980> I<00:02:40.579> believe<00:02:41.569> it<00:02:41.840> was<00:02:41.930> at

00:02:42.039 --> 00:02:42.049

00:02:42.049 --> 00:02:46.150 
and the custom size I believe it was at
480<00:02:42.560> by<00:02:42.799> 600<00:02:43.519> so<00:02:43.609> that<00:02:43.730> was<00:02:43.819> 480<00:02:44.299> with<00:02:44.569> by<00:02:45.350> 600

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 
480 by 600 so that was 480 with by 600

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:47.860 
480 by 600 so that was 480 with by 600

goes right behind the map and yeah it

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:01.130 
goes right behind the map and yeah it
just<00:04:00.000> kind<00:04:00.330> of<00:04:00.390> gives<00:04:00.569> it<00:04:00.659> a<00:04:00.720> little<00:04:00.870> bit<00:04:01.049> of

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:01.440 
coolest thing about it is you're just

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.050 
coolest thing about it is you're just
pasting<00:05:01.919> it<00:05:02.070> you're<00:05:02.190> not<00:05:02.310> creating<00:05:02.760> text

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:03.060

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:06.510 
boxes or HTML boxes to actually to put

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:11.360 
boxes or HTML boxes to actually to put
it<00:05:06.599> in<00:05:08.210> muses<00:05:09.210> that<00:05:09.630> you<00:05:09.750> have<00:05:09.960> copied<00:05:10.560> HTML

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:11.370 
it in muses that you have copied HTML

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:13.700 
it in muses that you have copied HTML
and<00:05:11.639> it<00:05:12.060> figures<00:05:12.330> out<00:05:12.750> it's<00:05:13.050> very<00:05:13.380> intuitive

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:13.710 
and it figures out it's very intuitive

00:05:13.710 --> 00:05:15.800 
and it figures out it's very intuitive
it<00:05:14.099> knows<00:05:14.460> what<00:05:14.700> to<00:05:14.820> do<00:05:14.940> with<00:05:15.060> everything<00:05:15.479> so
