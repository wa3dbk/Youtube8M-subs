00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:09.930 
basic scan and if you have frames should

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:12.170 
basic scan and if you have frames should

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220 
will see more enemies then you probably

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:31.249 
will see more enemies then you probably

ignore kilbourn scanner is not mandatory
but<00:00:55.200> it<00:00:55.530> helps<00:00:55.980> also<00:00:56.610> keep<00:00:56.790> in<00:00:56.940> mind<00:00:57.000> that

will be shown as clean but that doesn't

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.490 
will be shown as clean but that doesn't
mean<00:01:05.549> they<00:01:05.820> don't<00:01:06.000> have<00:01:06.270> bounty<00:01:06.750> you<00:01:07.080> just<00:01:07.380> do

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
mean they don't have bounty you just do

probably<00:01:11.490> this<00:01:12.450> type<00:01:12.750> of<00:01:12.780> bounty<00:01:13.470> hunting<00:01:13.920> is

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
probably this type of bounty hunting is

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.300 
probably this type of bounty hunting is
viable<00:01:14.310> only<00:01:14.940> in<00:01:15.180> low<00:01:15.780> full<00:01:16.110> space<00:01:16.440> where

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
after basics can you can see which ships

only<00:02:12.640> so<00:02:13.270> for<00:02:13.540> practicing<00:02:14.200> it's<00:02:14.410> good<00:02:14.650> but<00:02:14.830> not

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:15.070 
only so for practicing it's good but not

the<00:04:26.370> problem<00:04:26.849> is<00:04:27.000> you<00:04:27.030> will<00:04:27.389> need<00:04:27.810> to<00:04:28.169> have

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:28.380 
the problem is you will need to have

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:31.100 
the problem is you will need to have
Kilbourne<00:04:29.099> scanner<00:04:29.460> if<00:04:29.729> you<00:04:30.120> are<00:04:30.389> in<00:04:30.750> foreign

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:35.510 
money because after performing basic
scan<00:04:33.660> you<00:04:34.229> will<00:04:34.380> see<00:04:34.620> that<00:04:34.740> all<00:04:34.950> ships<00:04:35.310> in

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:35.520 
scan you will see that all ships in

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:38.719 
scan you will see that all ships in
energy<00:04:36.000> systems<00:04:36.450> are<00:04:36.660> clean<00:04:37.380> but<00:04:38.250> they<00:04:38.460> still

00:04:38.719 --> 00:04:38.729 
energy systems are clean but they still

00:05:43.279 --> 00:05:43.289 
one will be much safer to mine because

00:05:43.289 --> 00:05:45.679 
one will be much safer to mine because
there<00:05:43.529> will<00:05:43.649> be<00:05:43.830> bigger<00:05:44.159> presence<00:05:44.639> of<00:05:45.029> police

00:05:45.679 --> 00:05:45.689 
there will be bigger presence of police

00:05:45.689 --> 00:05:49.309 
there will be bigger presence of police
ships<00:05:46.550> but<00:05:47.550> same<00:05:47.789> time<00:05:48.089> I<00:05:48.360> streets<00:05:48.930> will<00:05:49.139> not

00:05:49.309 --> 00:05:49.319 
ships but same time I streets will not

00:05:49.319 --> 00:05:52.189 
ships but same time I streets will not
contain<00:05:49.709> as<00:05:50.009> much<00:05:50.399> precious<00:05:51.149> minerals<00:05:51.959> and

00:05:52.189 --> 00:05:52.199 
contain as much precious minerals and

00:05:52.199 --> 00:05:55.389 
contain as much precious minerals and
metals<00:05:52.759> in<00:05:53.759> other<00:05:54.149> we<00:05:54.419> will<00:05:54.569> have<00:05:54.809> much<00:05:55.020> more

00:05:55.389 --> 00:05:55.399 
metals in other we will have much more

00:05:55.399 --> 00:05:58.820 
metals in other we will have much more
pirates<00:05:56.399> at<00:05:57.029> same<00:05:57.330> time<00:05:57.659> the<00:05:58.080> mining<00:05:58.469> will<00:05:58.649> be

00:05:58.820 --> 00:05:58.830 
pirates at same time the mining will be

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:02.540 
pirates at same time the mining will be
much<00:05:59.039> more<00:05:59.279> profitable<00:05:59.580> and<00:06:01.219> also<00:06:02.219> we<00:06:02.399> will

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:02.550 
much more profitable and also we will

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:05.329 
much more profitable and also we will
have<00:06:02.759> drones<00:06:03.149> in<00:06:03.479> 1.3<00:06:04.080> also<00:06:04.620> we<00:06:04.769> have<00:06:04.979> beings

00:06:05.329 --> 00:06:05.339 
have drones in 1.3 also we have beings

00:06:05.339 --> 00:06:08.269 
have drones in 1.3 also we have beings
already<00:06:05.819> now<00:06:05.969> so<00:06:06.330> probably<00:06:06.779> miners<00:06:07.680> will<00:06:07.949> form

00:06:08.269 --> 00:06:08.279 
already now so probably miners will form

00:06:08.279 --> 00:06:10.699 
already now so probably miners will form
a<00:06:08.430> wing<00:06:08.610> go<00:06:09.449> there<00:06:09.689> with<00:06:09.899> some<00:06:10.050> heavy<00:06:10.289> ships

drones<00:06:11.219> mine<00:06:11.669> have<00:06:12.059> fun<00:06:12.360> with<00:06:12.569> pirates<00:06:13.080> maybe

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:13.830 
drones mine have fun with pirates maybe

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:16.879 
drones mine have fun with pirates maybe
not<00:06:14.039> filthy<00:06:14.930> but<00:06:15.930> fighting<00:06:16.199> that<00:06:16.499> extraction

00:06:16.879 --> 00:06:16.889 
not filthy but fighting that extraction

00:06:16.889 --> 00:06:20.629 
not filthy but fighting that extraction
size<00:06:17.279> is<00:06:17.729> much<00:06:18.180> more<00:06:18.539> fun<00:06:18.949> you<00:06:19.949> have<00:06:19.979> to<00:06:20.370> avoid

00:06:20.629 --> 00:06:20.639 
size is much more fun you have to avoid
