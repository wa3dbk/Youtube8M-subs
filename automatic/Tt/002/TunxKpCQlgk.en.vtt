00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:03.850
 all right 

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:09.209
 to me 

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:17.750
 the name of the disc comes with how 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.420
 it arose 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:22.070
 and everything that says in the letters of 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:26.320
 the songs with the most 

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:29.130
 songs if they go to the same thing they lead to 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:31.740
 I'm still here 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.050
 and besides all that of everything that 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.320
 means because it means a lot of 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:40.980
 things I had a very serious accident that I 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:43.320
 cost standing too long to be 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.470
 unable to sing during a lot of 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.470
 weather 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:50.940
 and it was a very big challenge to be able to 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.070
 do this I can not make this record that 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.450
 well the title symbolizes that is not the 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.100
 I'm still here 

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:00.720
 I want to tell people and I want to show 

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:02.710
 to the people that I'm still here 

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.280
 it's the voice 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:05.280
 a baby 

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:09.800
 my mom 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:17.560
 the record was recorded in Buenos Aires in 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.810
 nomadic mix and at the foot of the study of 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.060
 Alejandro Lerner comes with a lot of 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.550
 new things when I was wearing my 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:27.730
 heart in a lot of words this 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:29.690
 disc so for me it 's a dream come true 

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:33.250
 reality 

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:33.250
 trapped time 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:36.570
 from the past 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.670
 goodbye 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.090
 and having been able to share 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.690
 things that I had saved because it was 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:51.480
 something like that were things that I had 

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:54.540
 Saved in many subjects that bits 

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:56.910
 of topic that I had showed this that you 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:00.450
 he liked it very much and in the bible he 

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:03.270
 also liked to full that they are there 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:04.950
 producers of the disc and I started to 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:07.260
 work with that I started working with 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:09.670
 the lyrics with the melodies started to 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:12.430
 help they started to guide me 

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:14.739
 for that reason they laughed a little 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:18.890
 little things that I had accommodated and 

00:02:14.739 --> 00:02:21.510
 We played rabbit I bet you 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:26.000
 I leave 

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:26.000
 to look for you until the end 

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:36.030
 there are topics that represented stadiums 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.410
 I encourage you in my life in particular 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:39.990
 moment 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:42.360
 and it was like every song went 

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:44.220
 chaining to the one that followed today I 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:47.890
 I feel like much more mature being able 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:50.950
 enjoy music more 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:54.770
 of this project having lived 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:58.220
 from another place like that gives me 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:03:00.970
 a closeness and a distance of music 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:02.740
 I did not have before 

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:05.860
 in the sense of being able to look at it and 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:08.140
 observe it from other places where it does not 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:11.630
 He arrived where he could not, could not reach 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:14.780
 I could not enter and 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:17.920
 it's something beautiful for me to be able 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:17.920
 enjoy it week 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:25.110
 do not 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:25.110
 and the moment 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:28.390
 I 

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:33.469
 Y 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:38.540
 As I really want, I want to thank you 

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:40.670
 very much 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:42.590
 goodbye that gave me the possibility of today 

00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:45.560
 be here 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:48.200
 to the people who keep giving me so many 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:51.140
 joys in all places where 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:53.540
 I go every time I get closer to a 

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:55.280
 family and he would talk to me and tell me what 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:58.010
 good that the guys sang my 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:00.349
 songs that the 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:03.049
 the wife of the husband and they came and sang 

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:04.819
 the songs my songs and it's like 

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:08.000
 very familiar and they were always there 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:10.400
 so good for me is very big 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.650
 to be able to give them back a little bit of everything 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:15.140
 that they gave me back a little bit in 

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:17.319
 every show or with this so great for 

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:17.319
 my 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:23.840
 r 

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:26.650
 find yourself to be 

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:26.650
 in the end 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:36.730
 if me be 

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:36.730
 the reasons for living 

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:46.000
 If you give it an hour, start everything 

00:04:42.889 --> 00:04:46.000
 it is the artistic production 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:51.580
 from the hand of the auditor 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:56.280
 it's good that we had the possibility of 

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:56.280
 find us again in buenos aires 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:00.820
 but it's also going to be nice because 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:03.940
 it's like I was unaccustomed to 

00:05:00.820 --> 00:05:07.000
 all that when speaking in front of the cameras and 

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:09.310
 put shrapnel and nervous and good is 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.160
 another challenge that is that we are going to overcome 

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:13.990
 sure with this record is that after 

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:15.449
 all that happened good today I'm from 

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:17.500
 return 

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:20.500
 Y 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:20.500
 yes
