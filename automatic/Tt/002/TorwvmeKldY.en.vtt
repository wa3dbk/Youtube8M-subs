to<00:01:31.860> go<00:01:32.570> right<00:01:33.570> in<00:01:33.689> there<00:01:33.900> see<00:01:34.470> those<00:01:34.590> pull

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
to go right in there see those pull

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.730 
to go right in there see those pull
those<00:01:35.610> two<00:01:35.820> bolts<00:01:36.150> out<00:01:36.270> boom<00:01:37.200> you've<00:01:37.470> done<00:01:37.619> all

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:37.740 
those two bolts out boom you've done all

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.350 
those two bolts out boom you've done all
the<00:01:37.920> really<00:01:38.549> the<00:01:38.670> bolt<00:01:38.850> work<00:01:39.030> that<00:01:39.180> you<00:01:39.240> need

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360 
the really the bolt work that you need

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.569 
the really the bolt work that you need
to<00:01:39.450> do<00:01:39.600> this<00:01:40.259> doesn't<00:01:40.979> need<00:01:41.040> to<00:01:41.100> come<00:01:41.310> out<00:01:41.430> the

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
to do this doesn't need to come out the

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.050 
to do this doesn't need to come out the
handle<00:01:41.880> will<00:01:41.970> actually<00:01:42.299> slide<00:01:42.659> right<00:01:43.560> out

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:44.060 
handle will actually slide right out

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.160 
handle will actually slide right out
none<00:01:45.060> of<00:01:45.090> this<00:01:45.299> is<00:01:45.540> nothing<00:01:45.810> behind<00:01:45.899> here

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
none of this is nothing behind here

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:48.520 
none of this is nothing behind here
nothing<00:01:47.159> else<00:01:47.310> there's<00:01:47.640> nothing<00:01:47.790> else<00:01:48.119> to<00:01:48.360> it

nothing else there's nothing else to it
switch<00:01:49.530> of<00:01:49.680> course<00:01:49.920> there<00:01:50.189> is<00:01:50.340> kind<00:01:50.909> of<00:01:50.939> a

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
switch of course there is kind of a

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.399 
switch of course there is kind of a
module<00:01:51.420> over<00:01:51.630> there<00:01:51.810> and<00:01:51.930> on<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.079> driver<00:01:52.320> side

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
module over there and on the driver side

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:54.289 
module over there and on the driver side
there's<00:01:52.710> a<00:01:52.770> bigger<00:01:53.009> module<00:01:53.430> that<00:01:53.909> keep<00:01:54.149> that

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
there's a bigger module that keep that

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.660 
there's a bigger module that keep that
in<00:01:54.420> mind<00:01:54.689> so<00:01:55.590> when<00:01:55.770> you<00:01:55.829> pull<00:01:56.009> off<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.250> door

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
in mind so when you pull off the door

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.100 
in mind so when you pull off the door
they're<00:01:57.030> going<00:01:57.240> to<00:01:57.299> have<00:01:57.390> that<00:01:57.420> and<00:01:57.750> of<00:01:57.869> course

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
they're going to have that and of course

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.499 
they're going to have that and of course
the<00:01:58.740> lock-up<00:01:59.130> here<00:01:59.460> but<00:01:59.640> again<00:01:59.729> once<00:02:00.210> you<00:02:00.299> pull

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
the lock-up here but again once you pull

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.149 
the lock-up here but again once you pull
off<00:02:00.780> you<00:02:00.960> can<00:02:01.079> actually<00:02:01.200> slip<00:02:01.500> it<00:02:01.619> up<00:02:01.770> and<00:02:01.950> over

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
off you can actually slip it up and over

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:02.940 
off you can actually slip it up and over
and<00:02:02.250> away<00:02:02.399> you<00:02:02.430> go

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
and away you go

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:04.950 
and away you go
all<00:02:03.579> you're<00:02:03.880> going<00:02:03.969> to<00:02:04.090> do<00:02:04.149> then<00:02:04.329> once<00:02:04.810> you've

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 
all you're going to do then once you've

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:06.899 
all you're going to do then once you've
pull<00:02:05.200> off<00:02:05.320> the<00:02:05.680> two<00:02:05.829> bolts<00:02:06.219> and<00:02:06.490> a<00:02:06.670> little

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:06.909 
pull off the two bolts and a little

00:02:06.909 --> 00:02:09.089 
pull off the two bolts and a little
handle<00:02:07.240> you<00:02:08.200> grab<00:02:08.410> your<00:02:08.530> flat<00:02:08.769> head<00:02:08.800> once

00:02:09.089 --> 00:02:09.099 
handle you grab your flat head once

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:09.570 
handle you grab your flat head once
again

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:09.580 
again

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.600 
again
from<00:02:10.360> the<00:02:10.479> inside<00:02:11.110> of<00:02:11.500> the<00:02:11.769> door<00:02:12.040> all<00:02:12.580> right

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
from the inside of the door all right

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.600 
from the inside of the door all right
around<00:02:12.819> here<00:02:13.390> you<00:02:13.989> want<00:02:14.140> to<00:02:14.230> go<00:02:14.349> inside<00:02:14.769> and

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
around here you want to go inside and

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.300 
around here you want to go inside and
once<00:02:15.819> you<00:02:15.879> go<00:02:16.000> inside<00:02:16.150> you<00:02:16.420> just<00:02:16.450> pull<00:02:17.310> that's

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
once you go inside you just pull that's

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.059 
once you go inside you just pull that's
going<00:02:18.519> to<00:02:18.580> pop<00:02:18.849> off<00:02:19.290> nice<00:02:20.290> and<00:02:20.680> easy<00:02:20.860> look

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:21.069 
going to pop off nice and easy look

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:23.040 
going to pop off nice and easy look
actually<00:02:21.550> that<00:02:21.670> right<00:02:21.880> there<00:02:22.120> already<00:02:22.780> create

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:23.050 
actually that right there already create

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:24.059 
actually that right there already create
a<00:02:23.110> whole<00:02:23.230> gap<00:02:23.410> and<00:02:23.590> then<00:02:23.680> you're<00:02:23.800> just<00:02:23.950> going

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:29.130 
to run it all along and all the clips
are<00:02:28.150> release<00:02:28.360> they're<00:02:28.510> actually<00:02:28.780> fairly<00:02:29.019> easy

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:29.140 
are release they're actually fairly easy

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.250 
are release they're actually fairly easy
to<00:02:29.380> pull<00:02:29.650> off<00:02:29.799> so<00:02:30.190> again<00:02:30.540> not<00:02:31.540> very<00:02:31.599> hard<00:02:31.959> to<00:02:32.080> do

the older days those clips broke really

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.690 
the older days those clips broke really
easily<00:02:59.230> out<00:02:59.349> of<00:02:59.440> Eclipse<00:02:59.769> broke<00:03:00.099> or<00:03:00.280> they

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:00.700 
easily out of Eclipse broke or they

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.050 
easily out of Eclipse broke or they
actually<00:03:01.180> the<00:03:01.690> kind<00:03:01.900> of<00:03:01.959> like<00:03:02.849> that<00:03:03.849> where<00:03:03.970> it
