00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
lame dramatic video because I really

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.470 
lame dramatic video because I really

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.890 
truly believe that people would realize
that<00:00:27.660> it<00:00:27.869> wasn't<00:00:28.230> serious<00:00:28.500> and<00:00:29.090> I<00:00:30.090> was<00:00:30.420> wrong

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:30.900 
that it wasn't serious and I was wrong

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.780 
that it wasn't serious and I was wrong
pretty<00:00:31.380> much<00:00:31.560> more<00:00:31.949> wrong<00:00:32.220> than<00:00:32.250> I've<00:00:32.550> ever

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
pretty much more wrong than I've ever

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.580 
pretty much more wrong than I've ever
been<00:00:33.420> once<00:00:33.780> I<00:00:33.899> saw<00:00:34.079> that<00:00:34.110> it<00:00:34.290> totally

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
been once I saw that it totally

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:37.130 
been once I saw that it totally
backfired<00:00:34.890> I<00:00:35.489> added<00:00:35.910> a<00:00:36.030> scathing<00:00:36.450> disclaimer

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
backfired I added a scathing disclaimer

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.720 
backfired I added a scathing disclaimer
that<00:00:37.530> pretty<00:00:37.770> much<00:00:37.920> made<00:00:38.130> people<00:00:38.489> hate<00:00:38.700> it

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
that pretty much made people hate it

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.060 
that pretty much made people hate it
even<00:00:39.000> more<00:00:39.180> but<00:00:39.989> even<00:00:40.290> if<00:00:40.380> it<00:00:40.500> was<00:00:40.590> a<00:00:40.620> terrible

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
even more but even if it was a terrible

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.920 
even more but even if it was a terrible
joke<00:00:41.340> I<00:00:41.520> thought<00:00:41.850> it<00:00:42.030> was<00:00:42.120> at<00:00:42.239> least<00:00:42.450> made<00:00:42.780> up

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
joke I thought it was at least made up

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.709 
joke I thought it was at least made up
for<00:00:43.079> with<00:00:43.140> its<00:00:43.380> cuteness<00:00:43.680> and<00:00:44.040> apparently<00:00:44.719> no

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
for with its cuteness and apparently no

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.490 
for with its cuteness and apparently no
then<00:00:46.590> definitely<00:00:47.280> was<00:00:47.430> not<00:00:47.579> the<00:00:47.760> case<00:00:48.500> our

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
then definitely was not the case our

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.290 
then definitely was not the case our
second<00:00:49.829> contenders<00:00:50.250> my<00:00:50.430> boy<00:00:50.610> buried<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.120> dog

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
second contenders my boy buried the dog

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.299 
second contenders my boy buried the dog
with<00:00:51.510> excited<00:00:51.960> Auto<00:00:52.140> Tune<00:00:52.379> dog<00:00:52.620> this<00:00:52.980> was<00:00:53.160> one

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
with excited Auto Tune dog this was one

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:54.709 
with excited Auto Tune dog this was one
of<00:00:53.340> these<00:00:53.460> extra<00:00:53.820> short<00:00:54.000> videos<00:00:54.420> that<00:00:54.690> I

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
of these extra short videos that I

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.209 
of these extra short videos that I
thought<00:00:54.989> had<00:00:55.200> a<00:00:55.230> legit<00:00:55.620> chance<00:00:55.890> of<00:00:56.100> going

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
thought had a legit chance of going

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.250 
thought had a legit chance of going
viral<00:00:56.370> not<00:00:57.120> only<00:00:57.360> is<00:00:57.420> it<00:00:57.539> funny<00:00:57.780> on<00:00:57.930> its<00:00:58.110> own

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
viral not only is it funny on its own

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.630 
viral not only is it funny on its own
but<00:00:58.649> I<00:00:58.680> thought<00:00:58.860> it<00:00:58.980> would<00:00:59.100> kind<00:00:59.309> of<00:00:59.370> be<00:00:59.460> like<00:00:59.489> a

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 
but I thought it would kind of be like a

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.130 
but I thought it would kind of be like a
rick<00:00:59.879> roll<00:01:00.120> because<00:01:00.480> it<00:01:00.719> was<00:01:00.809> something<00:01:01.110> that

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
rick roll because it was something that

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.709 
rick roll because it was something that
you<00:01:01.289> weren't<00:01:01.440> expecting<00:01:01.590> you<00:01:02.160> know<00:01:02.280> yeah<00:01:02.719> plus

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
you weren't expecting you know yeah plus

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.029 
you weren't expecting you know yeah plus
I<00:01:03.840> thought<00:01:03.989> that<00:01:04.170> anyone<00:01:04.469> who<00:01:04.559> saw<00:01:04.709> the<00:01:04.739> same

00:01:05.029 --> 00:01:05.039 
I thought that anyone who saw the same

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:06.830 
I thought that anyone who saw the same
noise<00:01:05.249> in<00:01:05.399> my<00:01:05.429> excited<00:01:05.909> auto-tuned<00:01:06.329> cat<00:01:06.539> video

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
noise in my excited auto-tuned cat video

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.730 
noise in my excited auto-tuned cat video
would<00:01:07.829> really<00:01:08.130> think<00:01:08.310> that<00:01:08.459> it<00:01:08.520> was<00:01:08.639> funny<00:01:08.819> and

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:09.740 
would really think that it was funny and

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:12.800 
would really think that it was funny and
they<00:01:10.740> didn't<00:01:11.189> they<00:01:11.399> didn't<00:01:11.999> so<00:01:12.209> much<00:01:12.270> that

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
they didn't they didn't so much that

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.660 
they didn't they didn't so much that
these<00:01:12.959> people<00:01:13.170> actually<00:01:13.560> wanted<00:01:14.159> me<00:01:14.249> to<00:01:14.340> die

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:16.590 
like people were actually saying that

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.980 
like people were actually saying that
they<00:01:16.709> hoped<00:01:16.920> that<00:01:17.130> I<00:01:17.189> died<00:01:17.490> so<00:01:18.359> not<00:01:18.509> only<00:01:18.659> is<00:01:18.959> it
