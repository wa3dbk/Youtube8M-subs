first<00:02:18.400> metal<00:02:18.760> detector<00:02:19.239> the<00:02:19.780> very<00:02:20.110> first

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
first metal detector the very first

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.520 
first metal detector the very first
thing<00:02:20.680> I<00:02:20.799> found<00:02:21.010> was<00:02:21.580> in<00:02:21.790> 1919<00:02:22.780> weight<00:02:23.290> back

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
thing I found was in 1919 weight back

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.949 
thing I found was in 1919 weight back
penny<00:02:23.830> and<00:02:24.130> I<00:02:24.580> found<00:02:24.820> it<00:02:24.970> in<00:02:25.090> my<00:02:25.120> backyard<00:02:25.480> and

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:25.959 
penny and I found it in my backyard and

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:29.789 
penny and I found it in my backyard and
I<00:02:27.600> didn't<00:02:28.600> have<00:02:28.720> a<00:02:28.750> clue<00:02:29.049> what<00:02:29.080> I<00:02:29.260> was<00:02:29.470> doing

00:02:29.789 --> 00:02:29.799 
I didn't have a clue what I was doing

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:32.880 
I didn't have a clue what I was doing
and<00:02:29.980> I<00:02:30.850> dug<00:02:31.299> a<00:02:31.330> hole<00:02:31.600> that<00:02:31.930> was<00:02:32.049> about<00:02:32.350> this<00:02:32.620> big

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
and I dug a hole that was about this big

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.060 
and I dug a hole that was about this big
and<00:02:32.920> this<00:02:33.190> deep<00:02:33.630> because<00:02:34.630> the<00:02:35.620> coin<00:02:35.830> kept

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:36.070 
and this deep because the coin kept

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:37.440 
and this deep because the coin kept
rolling<00:02:36.400> from<00:02:36.519> the<00:02:36.670> side<00:02:36.850> of<00:02:36.880> the<00:02:37.060> hole<00:02:37.239> down

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
rolling from the side of the hole down

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:38.850 
rolling from the side of the hole down
to<00:02:37.660> the<00:02:37.750> bottom<00:02:38.049> because<00:02:38.230> I<00:02:38.380> didn't<00:02:38.680> know<00:02:38.739> how

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:38.860 
to the bottom because I didn't know how

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.140 
to the bottom because I didn't know how
to<00:02:38.890> pinpoint<00:02:39.190> but<00:02:39.580> I<00:02:39.880> was<00:02:40.090> so<00:02:40.239> excited<00:02:42.150> at

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:43.150 
to pinpoint but I was so excited at

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:46.080 
to pinpoint but I was so excited at
heart<00:02:43.630> I'm<00:02:44.019> a<00:02:44.290> treasurer<00:02:44.799> kind<00:02:45.100> of<00:02:45.220> I<00:02:45.400> think<00:02:45.790> it

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
heart I'm a treasurer kind of I think it

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:48.509 
heart I'm a treasurer kind of I think it
goes<00:02:46.239> beyond<00:02:46.660> metal<00:02:46.989> detecting<00:02:47.530> before<00:02:48.250> I

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:48.519 
goes beyond metal detecting before I

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:50.910 
goes beyond metal detecting before I
bought<00:02:48.790> my<00:02:48.970> first<00:02:49.000> detector<00:02:49.690> I<00:02:49.870> was<00:02:50.350> digging

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:50.920 
bought my first detector I was digging

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:11.220 
have a ball at it but this is

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.760 
have a ball at it but this is
predominantly<00:04:11.550> a<00:04:12.180> hobby<00:04:12.420> for<00:04:12.540> men<00:04:12.900> I<00:04:13.110> don't

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:13.770 
predominantly a hobby for men I don't

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:15.260 
predominantly a hobby for men I don't
know<00:04:13.920> why<00:04:14.130> more<00:04:14.340> women<00:04:14.490> don't<00:04:14.790> get<00:04:14.970> involved

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:15.270 
know why more women don't get involved

know why more women don't get involved
in<00:04:15.510> this<00:04:15.630> I<00:04:15.900> think<00:04:16.140> a<00:04:16.500> lot<00:04:16.680> of<00:04:16.710> it<00:04:16.920> has<00:04:17.070> to<00:04:17.100> do

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
in this I think a lot of it has to do

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.580 
in this I think a lot of it has to do
with<00:04:17.370> not<00:04:17.580> wanting<00:04:17.880> to<00:04:17.910> get<00:04:18.030> dirty<00:04:18.300> it's<00:04:19.050> the

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
with not wanting to get dirty it's the

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:20.990 
with not wanting to get dirty it's the
women<00:04:19.890> that<00:04:20.010> get<00:04:20.130> involved<00:04:20.340> in<00:04:20.610> this<00:04:20.730> or<00:04:20.910> the

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:31.370 
metal detecting because there's so much

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:34.089 
metal detecting because there's so much
of<00:06:31.430> it<00:06:31.669> here<00:06:32.139> when<00:06:33.139> I<00:06:33.169> lived<00:06:33.560> in<00:06:33.740> Northern

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:36.650 
California there was more history and I

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:38.469 
California there was more history and I
spent<00:06:36.949> a<00:06:37.039> lot<00:06:37.219> of<00:06:37.279> time<00:06:37.550> digging<00:06:38.120> up<00:06:38.360> old

spent a lot of time digging up old
silver<00:06:38.870> coins<00:06:39.139> but<00:06:39.710> then<00:06:39.889> I<00:06:39.979> got<00:06:40.159> bit<00:06:40.310> by<00:06:40.340> the

00:06:40.510 --> 00:06:40.520 
silver coins but then I got bit by the

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:41.730 
silver coins but then I got bit by the
Gold<00:06:40.759> Bug

00:06:41.730 --> 00:06:41.740 
Gold Bug

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:44.350

when<00:06:42.740> I<00:06:42.770> first<00:06:43.069> started<00:06:43.490> finding<00:06:43.849> gold<00:06:44.029> was

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:44.360 
when I first started finding gold was

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:45.580 
when I first started finding gold was
when<00:06:44.509> White's<00:06:44.719> came<00:06:44.960> out<00:06:45.110> with<00:06:45.259> their<00:06:45.409> first

when White's came out with their first
gold<00:06:45.860> detectors<00:06:46.400> the<00:06:46.669> gold<00:06:47.060> master<00:06:47.270> too<00:06:47.569> and<00:06:47.960> I

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:48.680 
gold detectors the gold master too and I

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:50.619 
gold detectors the gold master too and I
was<00:06:49.190> fortunate<00:06:49.490> to<00:06:49.759> live<00:06:49.969> close<00:06:50.210> enough<00:06:50.479> to

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:52.370 
the Sierra Nevada mountain range that I

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:53.740 
the Sierra Nevada mountain range that I
could<00:06:52.610> go<00:06:52.729> up<00:06:52.849> there<00:06:52.879> on<00:06:53.060> the<00:06:53.210> weekends<00:06:53.599> and

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:53.750 
could go up there on the weekends and

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:55.390 
could go up there on the weekends and
hunt<00:06:53.900> for<00:06:53.990> gold<00:06:54.199> and<00:06:54.440> once<00:06:54.620> I<00:06:54.740> started<00:06:55.069> finding

00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:55.400 
hunt for gold and once I started finding

00:06:55.400 --> 00:07:02.290 
hunt for gold and once I started finding
gold<00:06:55.550> that<00:06:55.849> was<00:06:56.029> just<00:06:56.270> real<00:06:56.449> special<00:07:01.090> we<00:07:02.090> had<00:07:02.270> a

00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:02.300 
gold that was just real special we had a

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:04.779 
gold that was just real special we had a
lot<00:07:02.690> of<00:07:02.719> rain<00:07:03.139> this<00:07:03.379> winter<00:07:03.590> and<00:07:04.190> it<00:07:04.610> took

00:07:04.779 --> 00:07:04.789 
lot of rain this winter and it took

00:07:04.789 --> 00:07:06.519 
lot of rain this winter and it took
these<00:07:04.969> washes<00:07:05.449> and<00:07:05.629> moved<00:07:05.810> a<00:07:05.930> lot<00:07:06.110> of<00:07:06.139> dirt

00:07:06.519 --> 00:07:06.529 
these washes and moved a lot of dirt

00:07:06.529 --> 00:07:14.260 
these washes and moved a lot of dirt
right<00:07:06.949> down<00:07:07.159> to<00:07:07.340> the<00:07:07.430> bedrock<00:07:12.819> I'm<00:07:13.819> getting<00:07:14.180> a

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:14.270 
right down to the bedrock I'm getting a

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:21.560 
right down to the bedrock I'm getting a
faint<00:07:14.539> signal<00:07:14.779> right<00:07:15.110> here

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:21.570 

00:07:21.570 --> 00:07:23.820 

when<00:07:22.570> you<00:07:22.690> get<00:07:22.840> a<00:07:22.870> faint<00:07:23.140> signal<00:07:23.320> like<00:07:23.650> that

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:23.830 
when you get a faint signal like that

00:07:23.830 --> 00:07:25.440 
when you get a faint signal like that
that<00:07:24.040> tells<00:07:24.310> me<00:07:24.490> that<00:07:24.520> it's<00:07:24.820> either<00:07:24.970> a<00:07:25.120> tiny

00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:25.450 
that tells me that it's either a tiny

00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:27.300 
that tells me that it's either a tiny
nugget<00:07:25.840> or<00:07:26.020> it's<00:07:26.290> a<00:07:26.440> larger<00:07:26.770> object<00:07:26.920> that's

00:07:27.300 --> 00:07:27.310 
nugget or it's a larger object that's

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:29.730 
nugget or it's a larger object that's
deep<00:07:27.900> but<00:07:28.900> since<00:07:29.110> we're<00:07:29.260> hunting<00:07:29.500> around<00:07:29.560> on

00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:29.740 
deep but since we're hunting around on

00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:32.820 
deep but since we're hunting around on
top<00:07:29.920> of<00:07:30.070> bedrock<00:07:30.930> it's<00:07:31.930> probably<00:07:32.470> something

00:07:32.820 --> 00:07:32.830 
top of bedrock it's probably something

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:34.800 
top of bedrock it's probably something
very<00:07:33.010> small<00:07:33.340> so<00:07:33.640> I<00:07:33.670> like<00:07:34.030> to<00:07:34.180> move<00:07:34.300> the<00:07:34.510> dirt<00:07:34.630> a

00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:34.810 
very small so I like to move the dirt a

00:07:34.810 --> 00:07:37.470 
very small so I like to move the dirt a
little<00:07:35.020> bit<00:07:35.170> at<00:07:35.350> a<00:07:35.470> time<00:07:35.850> so<00:07:36.850> I<00:07:36.880> don't<00:07:37.000> fling

00:07:37.470 --> 00:07:37.480 
little bit at a time so I don't fling

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:38.970 
little bit at a time so I don't fling
the<00:07:37.600> Nugget<00:07:37.930> and<00:07:37.960> then<00:07:38.140> have<00:07:38.320> to<00:07:38.350> go<00:07:38.560> and<00:07:38.710> find

00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:38.980 
the Nugget and then have to go and find

00:07:38.980 --> 00:07:41.220 
the Nugget and then have to go and find
it<00:07:39.130> again
