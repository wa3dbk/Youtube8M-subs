when you're trying it I think let's do

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.270 
when you're trying it I think let's do
it<00:00:54.809> with<00:00:54.989> a<00:00:55.020> stick<00:00:55.410> you<00:00:55.710> hit<00:00:55.829> it<00:00:55.860> with<00:00:55.980> a<00:00:56.039> silly

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
it with a stick you hit it with a silly

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.560
