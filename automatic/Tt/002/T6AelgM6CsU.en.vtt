wireless controller and a wired

00:03:38.669 --> 00:03:41.209 
wireless controller and a wired
controller<00:03:38.909> but<00:03:39.599> most<00:03:39.870> i'm<00:03:40.019> going<00:03:40.139> to<00:03:40.230> do<00:03:41.010> in

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:41.219 
controller but most i'm going to do in

00:03:41.219 --> 00:03:42.709 
controller but most i'm going to do in
this<00:03:41.340> video<00:03:41.579> is<00:03:41.760> the<00:03:41.939> wireless<00:03:42.209> controller

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:42.719 
this video is the wireless controller

00:03:42.719 --> 00:03:46.069 
this video is the wireless controller
but<00:03:43.349> the<00:03:43.949> most<00:03:44.069> important<00:03:44.909> controller<00:03:45.209> will
