if<00:01:16.380> you<00:01:17.009> actually<00:01:17.310> have<00:01:18.030> a<00:01:20.330> base<00:01:21.330> that<00:01:22.369> lights

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369 
if you actually have a base that lights

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:27.679 
if you actually have a base that lights
up<00:01:24.439> with<00:01:25.439> LED<00:01:26.100> lights<00:01:26.369> and<00:01:26.729> that's<00:01:27.210> what<00:01:27.509> this

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
up with LED lights and that's what this

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:33.050 
up with LED lights and that's what this
is<00:01:28.790> the<00:01:29.790> LED<00:01:30.329> lights<00:01:30.600> shine<00:01:31.500> up<00:01:31.770> through<00:01:32.280> the

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
is the LED lights shine up through the

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.190 
is the LED lights shine up through the
glass<00:01:33.390> crystal<00:01:34.189> lumen<00:01:35.189> aiding<00:01:36.200> the

words I love you let's take a look at

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.260 
words I love you let's take a look at
the<00:01:42.570> base<00:01:42.950> this<00:01:43.950> is<00:01:44.009> a<00:01:44.250> three<00:01:44.820> inch<00:01:45.950> diameter

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
the base this is a three inch diameter

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.990 
the base this is a three inch diameter
mera<00:01:48.270> base<00:01:48.720> with<00:01:49.409> a<00:01:49.439> rotating<00:01:50.220> top<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:50.790> top

the light on to show you how it looks
with<00:02:59.959> the<00:03:00.200> lighting<00:03:01.120> you<00:03:02.120> can<00:03:02.300> see<00:03:02.600> now<00:03:02.930> that

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
with the lighting you can see now that

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:10.990 
with the lighting you can see now that
is<00:03:03.650> rotating<00:03:04.400> you<00:03:06.190> can<00:03:07.190> switch<00:03:07.850> it<00:03:08.709> off<00:03:10.000> you

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 
is rotating you can switch it off you

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.240 
is rotating you can switch it off you
can<00:03:11.209> switch<00:03:11.480> it<00:03:11.510> on<00:03:11.780> to<00:03:12.560> where<00:03:12.680> the<00:03:12.709> base<00:03:12.980> is

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
can switch it on to where the base is

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.680 
can switch it on to where the base is
not<00:03:13.430> rotating<00:03:13.640> or<00:03:15.430> preferably<00:03:16.430> I<00:03:16.820> like<00:03:17.299> to<00:03:17.450> see

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:17.690 
not rotating or preferably I like to see

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:22.960 
not rotating or preferably I like to see
the<00:03:18.140> rotation<00:03:18.830> I<00:03:19.070> think<00:03:19.640> it's<00:03:19.760> beautiful<00:03:21.970> now

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:22.970 
the rotation I think it's beautiful now

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:37.810 
the rotation I think it's beautiful now
I'm<00:03:23.269> going<00:03:23.420> to<00:03:23.480> turn<00:03:23.660> off<00:03:23.720> the<00:03:23.989> lights
