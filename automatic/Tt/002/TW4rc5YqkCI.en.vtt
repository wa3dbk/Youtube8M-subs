 and there are the hard cores and lissac redoux 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:41.030
 so we're going to talk about sacredness 2 as the 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.030
 a giraffe when mating 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.729

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:53.040
 I had a bottle of milk 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.229
 I made a little jar and at each 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:02:01.229

 ah ah no moutet looked more like that 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.790
 then I asked myself several 

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:23.650
 questions why Quebecers are 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:26.200
 also mulcair why is there so much 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:28.360
 of course from us word that I have 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.959
 thought every moment before putting my 

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.489
 sundance 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:32.799
 I took out some answers which was 

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:44.109
 done mostly because of the fury the 

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:46.560
 pain is there on it seriously 

00:02:44.109 --> 00:02:49.930
 for everything among others for emotions 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:52.239
 but what's the point in a bag 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.430
 then I had a divine illumination 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:56.290
 first raised like children and 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:56.799

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.620
