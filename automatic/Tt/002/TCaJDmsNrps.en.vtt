00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
the knit stitch over and you can see

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.200 
the knit stitch over and you can see
that<00:01:42.469> we're<00:01:43.469> getting<00:01:43.560> this<00:01:43.770> very<00:01:44.549> nice<00:01:44.969> and

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
that we're getting this very nice and

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.779 
that we're getting this very nice and
stretchy<00:01:45.509> edge<00:01:45.810> and<00:01:46.369> the<00:01:47.369> reason<00:01:47.490> why<00:01:47.670> it's

00:01:47.779 --> 00:01:47.789 
stretchy edge and the reason why it's

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:49.520 
stretchy edge and the reason why it's
nice<00:01:47.909> and<00:01:48.030> stretchy<00:01:48.270> is<00:01:48.450> because<00:01:48.990> these<00:01:49.170> yarn

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
nice and stretchy is because these yarn

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.120 
nice and stretchy is because these yarn
overs<00:01:49.829> that<00:01:51.020> we're<00:01:52.020> doing<00:01:52.259> our<00:01:52.380> adding<00:01:52.859> more

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
overs that we're doing our adding more

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.599 
overs that we're doing our adding more
yarn<00:01:54.380> into<00:01:55.380> the<00:01:55.469> edge<00:01:55.619> and<00:01:55.979> it's<00:01:56.130> making<00:01:56.520> it

00:01:56.599 --> 00:01:56.609 
yarn into the edge and it's making it

00:01:56.609 --> 00:01:59.300 
yarn into the edge and it's making it
harder<00:01:56.880> to<00:01:56.909> pull<00:01:57.210> it<00:01:57.359> tight<00:01:57.840> so<00:01:58.679> reverse<00:01:58.979> yarn

00:01:59.300 --> 00:01:59.310 
harder to pull it tight so reverse yarn

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:07.510 
harder to pull it tight so reverse yarn
over<00:01:59.579> knit<00:02:00.740> a<00:02:01.740> stitch<00:02:05.390> pull<00:02:06.390> the<00:02:06.659> yarn<00:02:06.869> over

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
over knit a stitch pull the yarn over

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.930 
over knit a stitch pull the yarn over
over<00:02:08.520> the<00:02:08.640> knit<00:02:08.790> stitch

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:13.960 
and then bind off the stitch after each

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:15.180 
and then bind off the stitch after each
time<00:02:14.200> after<00:02:14.440> you<00:02:14.500> bind<00:02:14.650> off<00:02:14.740> a<00:02:14.830> stitch<00:02:15.040> you

always do your reverse yarn over a
normal<00:02:18.940> yawn<00:02:19.120> over<00:02:19.390> would<00:02:19.600> look<00:02:19.780> like<00:02:19.930> that

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
normal yawn over would look like that

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.550 
normal yawn over would look like that
the<00:02:21.910> reverse<00:02:22.210> yarn<00:02:22.540> over<00:02:22.720> you<00:02:22.840> go<00:02:22.990> up<00:02:23.290> from

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
the reverse yarn over you go up from

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.360 
the reverse yarn over you go up from
