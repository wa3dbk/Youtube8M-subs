00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:20.130
 friends farmers friends farmer hello 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:21.660
 welcome to the farm welcome to 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.689
 cocotte tv today I present to you 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.760
 the ozone bled so the keyboard that we 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.189
 send the keyboard mark to the keys the 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.810
 prophet who portable membrane this 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:32.040
 this time being we are close to 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.590
 portable but it's still not 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.989
 keyboard gaming scissors it's 

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:39.149
 classic ozone that is rather focused 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:45.420
 keyboard gaming we also receive 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:46.980
 in August laye azerty iso keyboard sold 49 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.660
 90 euros if I'm not mistaken 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.090
 which is both little and at the same time 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.090
 a lot a lot for the simple and 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:58.170
 good reason that the bundle for example 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:00.239
 is relatively sober or even a pretty 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.000
 little therefore a hulotist of 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:04.470
 the user a cd of drivers and that's 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.810
 almost everything 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:10.070
 let's go next keyboard that you 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:15.360
 see why again 49 euros 90 

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:18.150
 it's a lot to the extent that everyone 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.500
 bottom box at the level of the quality of 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.630
 manufacture and finishing 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.159
 so it's not so much the finish that 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.710
 calls for great criticism that the 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:28.009
 quality release product plastic 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.990
 is not valorizing the plastic 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:32.520
 a little shiny 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.290
 so he's crazy about plastic as much you 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.390
 to say that at the level of rigidity it is 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.729
 not that I do not know if you see how 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:39.860
 point I can twist it right and 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:42.329
 left 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.920
 then always at the level of quality 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:45.270
 of the classic you see for example here 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.399
 this title and it's not a stain 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.460
 yielding plastic so a case had a 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:52.560
 treatment not necessarily very successful if 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:53.850
 we still look in detail you 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.490
 will you see that for example 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:59.430
 escapes here is not right and we 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.680
 find here for example writings 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.659
 who drool a little gap between 

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:07.079
 letters that are not necessarily all about 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:08.910
 done clean of the cost 49 euros it seems 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:10.289
 a little much so it seems 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.890
 little also because it is relatively 

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:13.900
 complete for a gaming keyboard 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:15.970
 as far as where you are going to find 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.800
 macro keys on the side that 

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:20.319
 can go up to 50 out of the five 

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.060
 profiles so profiles that is managed 

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:23.470
 thanks to this key 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:27.069
 switch from one profile to another 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:28.270
 in game the function key the 

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:30.490
 backlight because it is 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:33.790
 fully backlit on two 

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:37.410
 color levels the fashion key 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:39.730
 gaming to disable the windows key 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:42.250
 above the numeric keypad we find 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.660
 the three classic led with a small 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.520
 rule is so sliding and when 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:46.870
 not even perfect far from it that goes 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:50.410
 allow to adjust the intensity of the 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:52.360
 backlight the wrist rest is 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:54.190
 integrated as you see then 

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:56.320
 with ticket lines it is rather 

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:58.239
 pretty damn I already used a whole 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:59.590
 little bit really not much I tell you 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:02.860
 not found that the wrist rest was 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:05.200
 completely impertinent will we say it 

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:07.390
 is rather well placed the small slots 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.160
 here are going to let go of 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:11.680
 backlighting there is a marking 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:15.760
 of ozone on the center as usual 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:17.320
 underneath nothing particular two 

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.390
 small rubber pads on the front 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:22.000
 plastic elevation tabs 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:25.150
 hard on the back that's pretty much everything 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:28.030
 then the cable is braided ends 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:29.110
 by a slammed usb so that's normal 

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.970
 for a gaming keyboard 

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:33.760
 in terms of characteristics 

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:36.790
 techniques we are entitled to I the 

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.930
 said color of the backlighting 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:40.540
 adjustable intensity 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:43.030
 we also have five profiles they 

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:44.829
 will handle here the keys the keys of 

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:47.709
 macros that loses reimer will allow 

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:50.260
 sorry to go up to 50 macro one 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:53.130
 memory chip inside 128 kg which 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:55.840
 will reap them there too 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:58.630
 1.1 mg kg roberge searched for a gun 

00:03:55.840 --> 00:04:00.820
 and rollers so complete the polyglot and 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:04.900
 amy luers i think i pretty much 

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:07.060
 globally does not produce a product 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:09.430
 necessarily very expensive but who at the level 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:10.930
 perception and the quality emerges 

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:11.320
 still not be unleashed 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:15.970
 crowds 

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:18.039
 So ozone and blade test in writing 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:19.840
 very soon on cowcotland.com I will you 

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:21.729
 invite to come read the written test even 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:23.310
 if he will not stay in the annals 

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:24.780
 here you are 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:26.280

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:28.940
