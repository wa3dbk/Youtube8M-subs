 I do not really know what he's doing but apparently it's good 

00:00:08.879 --> 00:00:13.080
 some 7000 demons who would clean the assembly but all in the oven 

00:00:14.359 --> 00:00:17.090
 is this the case there have always been motorcycles everywhere at his place 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:19.859
 he keeps - 4 in the dining room 

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:22.630
 there are some in 3d salon scheier

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:27.650
 I find it cool 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:34.210
 every parent in the depths of england 

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.210
 quickly a wizard with a penchant for allowing him

 fuel from spare parts of older models going back 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:54.750
 at the time when power was synonymous with promoter if it is 

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:58.460

 I bought piece by piece all over the country and on the internet 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:07.690
 anne i cut the engine 1 2 m and I assembled with half of another 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:09.760
 engine to make a v12 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.710
 they have to be original and that it looks more like a 

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:16.030
 machined motorcycle I do not like we see that it's home made of course 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.030
 sometimes it takes a plan to break the rules 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.259
 I made people believe that this old motorcycle study considering the 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:27.259
 expectations a machined prototype of ancestral times 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:32.380
 I visualize the finished work before I even start because then I go out 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.690
 hacksaw and I put myself and that I take engines in perfect condition 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:38.970
 walk dice and then I take half of each game is 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.300
 welded it works 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:42.570
 okay when I see 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.060
 It's simple as hello 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.940
 the main body welcome 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.250

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.530
 at the final assembly in the kitchen 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.299
 I use the stove for soaking and the dishwasher for the 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:58.560
 chemical cleaning 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.540

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.759
 something really unique 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:14.329

00:02:14.329 --> 00:02:14.829
 together
