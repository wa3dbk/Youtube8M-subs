00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:43.480 
tell me a little bit about your latest

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.620 
tell me a little bit about your latest
LSA<00:00:44.020> entry<00:00:44.800> what<00:00:45.400> was<00:00:45.580> your<00:00:45.850> thinking<00:00:46.120> for<00:00:46.480> it

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:46.630 
LSA entry what was your thinking for it

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:48.060 
LSA entry what was your thinking for it
and<00:00:46.840> obviously<00:00:47.290> it's<00:00:47.470> a<00:00:47.530> bit<00:00:47.680> of<00:00:47.770> a<00:00:47.800> departure

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:48.070 
and obviously it's a bit of a departure

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.630 
and obviously it's a bit of a departure
from<00:00:48.460> the<00:00:48.550> usual<00:00:48.700> rands<00:00:49.360> norm<00:00:50.280> it<00:00:51.280> could<00:00:51.490> be

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:51.640 
from the usual rands norm it could be

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.520

the first new design since the ruin and

SAS<00:01:30.509> but<00:01:31.509> the<00:01:31.690> philosophy<00:01:32.290> behind<00:01:32.320> it<00:01:32.860> was<00:01:33.040> is

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:33.280 
SAS but the philosophy behind it was is

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:34.560 
SAS but the philosophy behind it was is
to<00:01:33.430> be<00:01:33.550> able<00:01:33.640> to<00:01:33.790> build<00:01:33.970> it<00:01:34.119> mostly<00:01:34.479> on

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:34.570 
to be able to build it mostly on

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:37.740 
to be able to build it mostly on
computer<00:01:35.229> and<00:01:35.670> take<00:01:36.670> all<00:01:36.910> the<00:01:37.060> handiwork<00:01:37.420> out

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:37.750 
computer and take all the handiwork out

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:40.320 
computer and take all the handiwork out
of<00:01:37.869> it<00:01:37.990> so<00:01:38.110> we<00:01:38.229> can<00:01:38.380> get<00:01:38.500> decent<00:01:39.330> production

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:40.330 
of it so we can get decent production

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.600 
of it so we can get decent production
times<00:01:40.660> decent<00:01:41.350> repeatability<00:01:41.890> have<00:01:42.369> very

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:42.610 
times decent repeatability have very

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:45.499 
times decent repeatability have very
consistent<00:01:43.180> quality<00:01:43.450> and<00:01:43.720> the<00:01:44.619> plane<00:01:44.860> itself

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509

imagine at this point that you built

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:23.150 
imagine at this point that you built
this<00:03:20.910> to<00:03:21.209> be<00:03:21.329> produced<00:03:21.720> so<00:03:22.200> what<00:03:23.040> have<00:03:23.130> you

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:23.160 
this to be produced so what have you

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:24.680 
this to be produced so what have you
done<00:03:23.340> as<00:03:23.489> far<00:03:23.670> as<00:03:23.700> economies<00:03:24.180> of<00:03:24.209> scale<00:03:24.510> for

going like this
we've<00:03:49.620> got<00:03:49.829> 12<00:03:50.160> months<00:03:50.430> that<00:03:50.880> we<00:03:51.180> want<00:03:51.329> to<00:03:51.389> ramp

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
we've got 12 months that we want to ramp

we've got 12 months that we want to ramp
up<00:03:51.840> to<00:03:52.019> be<00:03:52.139> building<00:03:52.530> one<00:03:52.560> a<00:03:52.799> week<00:03:53.099> and<00:03:53.400> then<00:03:53.519> a

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
up to be building one a week and then a

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.550 
up to be building one a week and then a
few<00:03:54.389> months<00:03:54.540> after<00:03:54.750> that<00:03:54.930> we<00:03:55.169> hope<00:03:55.290> to<00:03:55.440> be

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
few months after that we hope to be

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.979 
few months after that we hope to be
about<00:03:55.769> one<00:03:56.099> and<00:03:56.220> a<00:03:56.280> half<00:03:56.310> maybe<00:03:56.639> two<00:03:56.989> it's

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:57.989 
about one and a half maybe two it's

00:03:57.989 --> 00:03:59.629 
about one and a half maybe two it's
going<00:03:58.139> to<00:03:58.200> take<00:03:58.380> us<00:03:58.530> 12<00:03:58.799> months<00:03:59.069> to<00:03:59.190> get<00:03:59.370> there

00:03:59.629 --> 00:03:59.639 
going to take us 12 months to get there

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:00.890 
going to take us 12 months to get there
in<00:03:59.790> the<00:03:59.880> meantime<00:04:00.090> we're<00:04:00.510> building<00:04:00.810> a

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
in the meantime we're building a

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.740 
in the meantime we're building a
sampling<00:04:01.380> of<00:04:01.590> aircraft<00:04:02.220> to<00:04:02.430> organize<00:04:03.269> the<00:04:03.510> QA

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
sampling of aircraft to organize the QA

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.750 
sampling of aircraft to organize the QA
systems<00:04:04.349> and<00:04:04.739> the<00:04:05.160> protocols<00:04:05.700> in<00:04:05.849> the<00:04:05.970> factory

systems and the protocols in the factory

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:11.569 
systems and the protocols in the factory
was<00:04:08.760> it<00:04:08.910> much<00:04:09.060> of<00:04:09.090> a<00:04:09.680> change<00:04:10.680> for<00:04:11.010> you<00:04:11.130> to<00:04:11.160> start

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:11.579 
was it much of a change for you to start

00:04:11.579 --> 00:04:15.830 
was it much of a change for you to start
thinking<00:04:11.910> all-metal<00:04:13.430> know<00:04:14.430> it<00:04:14.970> it's

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:15.840 
thinking all-metal know it it's

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.180 
thinking all-metal know it it's
something<00:04:16.199> we<00:04:16.290> always<00:04:16.530> wanted<00:04:16.799> to<00:04:16.859> do<00:04:17.040> and

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:17.190 
something we always wanted to do and

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:18.920 
something we always wanted to do and
we've<00:04:17.340> done<00:04:17.519> a<00:04:17.820> lot<00:04:18.150> of<00:04:18.180> metalwork<00:04:18.630> if<00:04:18.870> you

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:18.930 
we've done a lot of metalwork if you

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:20.600 
we've done a lot of metalwork if you
look<00:04:19.079> at<00:04:19.169> our<00:04:19.259> aircraft

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:20.610 
look at our aircraft

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:22.910 
look at our aircraft
the<00:04:20.970> s12<00:04:21.510> was<00:04:21.810> all<00:04:21.960> metal<00:04:22.260> with<00:04:22.410> the<00:04:22.440> exception

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:22.920 
the s12 was all metal with the exception

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:24.620 
the s12 was all metal with the exception
of<00:04:23.010> some<00:04:23.250> fabric<00:04:23.910> covering<00:04:24.180> on<00:04:24.240> the<00:04:24.270> wing<00:04:24.450> and

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:24.630 
of some fabric covering on the wing and

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:27.380 
of some fabric covering on the wing and
tail<00:04:24.810> the<00:04:25.110> pursuit<00:04:25.530> was<00:04:25.560> pretty<00:04:26.190> much<00:04:26.370> a<00:04:26.730> half

00:04:27.380 --> 00:04:27.390 
tail the pursuit was pretty much a half

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:29.840 
tail the pursuit was pretty much a half
and<00:04:27.570> a<00:04:27.600> half<00:04:27.630> the<00:04:27.990> f16<00:04:28.620> was<00:04:28.830> composite<00:04:29.730> and

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:29.850 
and a half the f16 was composite and

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:31.820 
and a half the f16 was composite and
metal<00:04:30.270> so<00:04:30.870> it's<00:04:31.080> not<00:04:31.260> something<00:04:31.710> we're

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830 
metal so it's not something we're

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:33.890 
metal so it's not something we're
unfamiliar<00:04:32.430> with<00:04:32.550> in<00:04:32.820> and<00:04:33.360> I<00:04:33.450> think<00:04:33.690> we<00:04:33.780> have

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 
unfamiliar with in and I think we have

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:35.270 
unfamiliar with in and I think we have

from the very beginning I thought it was
ridiculous

00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:33.690 
ridiculous

00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:35.719
