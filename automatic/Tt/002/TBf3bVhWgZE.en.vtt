I'll have a link right there so learn

00:01:30.179 --> 00:01:31.880 
I'll have a link right there so learn
those<00:01:30.359> two<00:01:30.539> things<00:01:30.719> like<00:01:30.929> I<00:01:31.049> said<00:01:31.259> they're<00:01:31.649> not

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:31.890 
those two things like I said they're not

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:33.859 
those two things like I said they're not
necessary<00:01:32.490> but<00:01:32.789> they<00:01:32.909> can<00:01:33.060> enhance<00:01:33.359> the<00:01:33.599> trick

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:33.869 
necessary but they can enhance the trick

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.719 
necessary but they can enhance the trick
and<00:01:34.049> once<00:01:34.859> you've<00:01:34.979> learned<00:01:35.159> those<00:01:35.340> come<00:01:35.579> back

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
personally I just like to go with the

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.359

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.279 
pick a card any card I like to say it's
cliche<00:02:08.789> because<00:02:09.000> most<00:02:09.420> magic<00:02:09.840> tricks<00:02:10.079> are

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
cliche because most magic tricks are

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.379 
cliche because most magic tricks are
simple<00:02:10.889> magic<00:02:11.220> tricks<00:02:11.430> do<00:02:11.579> start<00:02:12.030> with<00:02:12.060> a<00:02:12.180> pick

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:12.389 
simple magic tricks do start with a pick

00:02:12.389 --> 00:02:14.420 
simple magic tricks do start with a pick
a<00:02:12.420> card<00:02:12.720> so<00:02:12.989> I<00:02:13.200> like<00:02:13.500> to<00:02:13.530> say<00:02:13.769> it's<00:02:13.889> cliche<00:02:14.280> and

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430 
a card so I like to say it's cliche and

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:15.860 
a card so I like to say it's cliche and
make<00:02:14.519> them<00:02:14.609> laugh<00:02:14.790> a<00:02:14.970> little<00:02:15.209> they'll<00:02:15.690> choose

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
make them laugh a little they'll choose

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:17.720 
make them laugh a little they'll choose
a<00:02:15.900> card<00:02:16.200> and<00:02:16.410> it<00:02:16.470> does<00:02:16.680> not<00:02:16.829> matter<00:02:17.040> what<00:02:17.489> card

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:17.730 
a card and it does not matter what card

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.430 
a card and it does not matter what card
they<00:02:17.790> choose<00:02:18.090> as<00:02:18.299> long<00:02:18.450> as<00:02:18.630> obviously<00:02:19.019> they

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
they choose as long as obviously they

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.229 
they choose as long as obviously they
don't<00:02:19.530> choose<00:02:19.769> the<00:02:19.859> bottom<00:02:20.160> card<00:02:20.370> so<00:02:21.209> let's

00:02:21.229 --> 00:02:21.239

say they choose this card now for the
majority<00:02:24.630> of<00:02:24.660> your<00:02:25.019> tricks<00:02:25.380> if<00:02:25.590> you're<00:02:25.799> going

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
because they're going to be pretty

because they're going to be pretty
occupied<00:02:44.459> so<00:02:45.269> if<00:02:45.329> you're<00:02:45.480> just<00:02:45.510> talking<00:02:46.049> to

the<00:02:49.230> switch<00:02:49.500> it's<00:02:49.769> very<00:02:50.130> simple

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
the switch it's very simple

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.170 
the switch it's very simple
I<00:02:50.790> recommend<00:02:51.630> the<00:02:51.810> deck<00:02:52.319> flip<00:02:52.639> but<00:02:53.639> you<00:02:54.090> know

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180 
I recommend the deck flip but you know

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.430 
I recommend the deck flip but you know
you<00:02:54.239> don't<00:02:54.419> have<00:02:54.599> to<00:02:54.810> if<00:02:54.900> you<00:02:54.959> don't<00:02:55.019> want<00:02:55.200> to

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
you don't have to if you don't want to

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.199 
you don't have to if you don't want to
anyway<00:02:55.980> so<00:02:56.040> you're<00:02:56.250> in<00:02:56.340> this<00:02:56.459> position<00:02:56.940> where

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
anyway so you're in this position where

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:59.449 
anyway so you're in this position where
all<00:02:57.239> the<00:02:57.510> cards<00:02:57.840> are<00:02:57.959> face<00:02:58.260> up<00:02:58.319> except<00:02:59.280> for<00:02:59.400> the

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
all the cards are face up except for the

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:00.530 
all the cards are face up except for the
bottom<00:02:59.609> one

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540 
bottom one

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.059 
bottom one
so<00:03:01.230> they're<00:03:01.379> going<00:03:01.470> to<00:03:01.530> give<00:03:01.739> you<00:03:01.830> back<00:03:02.040> the

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.069 
so they're going to give you back the

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:04.550 
so they're going to give you back the
card<00:03:02.519> you<00:03:03.390> don't<00:03:03.510> need<00:03:03.689> to<00:03:03.780> see<00:03:03.959> it<00:03:03.989> it<00:03:04.260> makes

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
card you don't need to see it it makes

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:05.929 
card you don't need to see it it makes
it<00:03:04.680> better<00:03:04.799> if<00:03:04.950> you<00:03:05.040> don't<00:03:05.189> and<00:03:05.489> you're<00:03:05.790> going

00:03:05.929 --> 00:03:05.939 
it better if you don't and you're going

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:07.490 
it better if you don't and you're going
to<00:03:05.970> stick<00:03:06.209> that<00:03:06.239> card<00:03:06.720> as<00:03:06.900> long<00:03:06.959> as<00:03:07.230> you<00:03:07.319> don't

00:03:07.490 --> 00:03:07.500 
to stick that card as long as you don't

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.740 
to stick that card as long as you don't
do<00:03:07.799> one<00:03:07.980> of<00:03:08.069> these<00:03:08.220> and<00:03:08.579> they<00:03:09.150> see<00:03:09.209> that<00:03:09.450> card

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
do one of these and they see that card

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.990 
do one of these and they see that card
you<00:03:10.650> can<00:03:10.769> just<00:03:10.920> stick<00:03:11.129> it<00:03:11.280> anywhere<00:03:11.730> you<00:03:11.849> like

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
you can just stick it anywhere you like

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.440 
you can just stick it anywhere you like
in<00:03:12.120> the<00:03:12.180> deck

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
in the deck

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:13.850 
in the deck
I<00:03:12.480> recommend<00:03:12.959> the<00:03:13.049> center<00:03:13.349> it<00:03:13.530> just<00:03:13.709> makes

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
I recommend the center it just makes

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:15.800 
I recommend the center it just makes
sense<00:03:14.069> that<00:03:14.220> way<00:03:14.489> you<00:03:14.939> can<00:03:15.090> show<00:03:15.329> them<00:03:15.540> just

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:15.810 
sense that way you can show them just

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:17.449 
sense that way you can show them just
make<00:03:15.989> sure<00:03:16.079> you<00:03:16.170> don't<00:03:16.290> flip<00:03:16.530> or<00:03:16.650> anything<00:03:16.829> you

00:03:17.449 --> 00:03:17.459 
make sure you don't flip or anything you

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:36.120 
recommend you try to learn it you can

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.819 
recommend you try to learn it you can
always<00:03:36.269> do<00:03:36.629> the<00:03:36.930> little<00:03:37.140> wave<00:03:37.379> of<00:03:37.409> the<00:03:37.590> hand

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:37.829 
always do the little wave of the hand

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:39.890 
always do the little wave of the hand
and<00:03:38.040> say<00:03:38.220> I've<00:03:38.489> made<00:03:39.060> it<00:03:39.209> so<00:03:39.239> that<00:03:39.420> all<00:03:39.720> the

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:39.900 
and say I've made it so that all the

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.470 
and say I've made it so that all the
cards<00:03:40.260> go<00:03:41.099> face-up<00:03:41.609> and<00:03:41.909> you<00:03:42.180> can<00:03:42.329> do

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
cards go face-up and you can do

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.420 
cards go face-up and you can do
something<00:03:42.840> like<00:03:42.870> that<00:03:43.200> and<00:03:43.440> then<00:03:44.190> at<00:03:44.310> that

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
something like that and then at that

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:47.000 
something like that and then at that
point<00:03:44.730> it's<00:03:44.879> just<00:03:44.940> revealing<00:03:45.870> the<00:03:46.079> card<00:03:46.349> being

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:47.010 
point it's just revealing the card being

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:49.699 
point it's just revealing the card being
the<00:03:47.159> only<00:03:47.370> card<00:03:47.609> facedown<00:03:48.299> in<00:03:48.720> a<00:03:48.780> face-up<00:03:49.170> deck

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
the only card facedown in a face-up deck

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:52.250 
the only card facedown in a face-up deck
and<00:03:50.010> that's<00:03:50.670> pretty<00:03:50.819> much<00:03:50.940> refined<00:03:51.389> by<00:03:51.900> Josh

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
and that's pretty much refined by Josh

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:53.990 
and that's pretty much refined by Josh
brand<00:03:52.590> like<00:03:52.739> I<00:03:52.829> said<00:03:52.980> I<00:03:53.010> recommend<00:03:53.639> you<00:03:53.730> do<00:03:53.849> the

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
Cardini change because at that point

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:59.750 
Cardini change because at that point
their<00:03:56.519> card<00:03:56.819> is<00:03:56.970> lost<00:03:57.269> in<00:03:58.200> the<00:03:58.409> center<00:03:58.799> and<00:03:59.670> you

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
their card is lost in the center and you

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:00.949 
their card is lost in the center and you
