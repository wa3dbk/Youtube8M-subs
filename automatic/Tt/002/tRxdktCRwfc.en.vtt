00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:04.439

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:07.330
 motorcycle it much better here 

00:00:04.439 --> 00:00:12.339
 but the others were distributed 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:14.709
 next to classic stand as we speak 

00:00:12.339 --> 00:00:15.549
 The normal motorcycles can be third 

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:20.890
 position 

00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:23.270
 the 18 he comes from prague 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:26.030
 the positions are so 

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:27.500
 distributed here we have the 13 has in 

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:30.860
 brought luck last year 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:33.540
 and this year she will too 

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:38.120
 there will be here 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:39.820
 that the day wins and 5 points 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:43.899
 great told the passing process 

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:47.239
 left-wing horse ripped in the middle 

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:50.660
 already eaten and deducted catalyst 

00:00:47.239 --> 00:00:55.640
 inside you see good eye and now 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:59.290
 had the shorter way and approached them 

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.290
 Guests are then driven past 

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:07.330
 among the 15,000 also helmut 

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:09.229
 bradl the fourth of this year's 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:11.210
 road world championship only with the 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:13.400
 motorcycle drove here and see you 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:17.780
 Even his autographs are very 

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:19.520
 desires karl smith has the top of the image 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.640
 most points from the heats 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.210
 collected and now starts at the top 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:27.870
 with it 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:29.830
 gerd riss gustafsson orchestra 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:32.150
 first semifinals 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:35.360
 merkel and co 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:37.100
 is gone bad was just on 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:40.150
 fourth place 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.150
 it is in front 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:50.220
 then the number will be measured assistant 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:52.320
 a fall on the other side that is 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:55.370
 the woman clashed will be small 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:59.870
 see the slow motion what happened there 

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:59.870
 13 it came from it 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:16.050
 the slow motion ends rather dreary 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:19.800
 motorcycle the machine flies it in the 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:21.300
 back the bad wurzacher had 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.760
 Huge luck that they are on the 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:26.480
 machine can stop and then he drives 

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:26.480
 in this machine 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:35.400
 it is vice versa kallmeyer can straight 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:41.540
 still on the right side of so dramatic and 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:41.540
 Of course, all of them are also unhappy 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.140
 Just before the final, it's annoying 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:48.420
 of course, a crucial role 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:50.160
 but we hope that the drivers nothing 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.110
 happened and that she is in 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.000
 repeat run 

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:55.680
 our partners klaus kabisch can us 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.930
 possibly about the consequences now 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.520
 already enlighten and then we show by 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.910
 this event still the absolute 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:04.710
 final 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:07.080
 Unfortunately, Uwe KÃ¤stner had to go unconscious 

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:08.790
 be removed from the helicopter 

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:10.890
 we hope that the audience will be happy 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.200
 OsnabrÃ¼cker here quite 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:15.330
 excellent before soon healthy again 

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.190
 was going on with the polluter fall 

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:19.170
 was because of rowdy driving style 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:22.140
 Disqualifies a ridiculous punishment 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:23.850
 for the brainless Englishman now show 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.560
 we give you the final for yourself 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:27.140
 right to left following driver 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.420
 have qualified 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:34.440
 perthes mask has all the streams 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:36.720
 markram karl maier and everything is with her 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:39.630
 in this final possible only one stands 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:42.090
 firm if karl maier or mask has 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:45.270
 win this run then the winner 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:47.390
 otherwise world champions are the points 

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:51.239
 close to each other 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:53.640
 this is even after this final too 

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:55.260
 A sting could come what we for 

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:58.709
 Of course they do not hope we want 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:04.220
 now the final show and the handball 

00:03:58.709 --> 00:04:04.220
 world champion of the year 1992 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:14.900
 kallmeyer becomes the fifth time 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:16.239
 World Champion 

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:19.239
 can 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:21.139
 he is defending his title 

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:22.240
 all tribes 

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:24.650
 prague 

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:27.490
 for the first time world champion 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:31.090
 and now they go from 

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:34.050
 karl maier got away badly 

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:37.210
 with the brown in the swiss marcel 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:42.370
 gerd-peter 3 he is in the lead 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:45.099
 behind the number four with the 

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:49.150
 New Zealand kahlmeyer already 

00:04:45.099 --> 00:04:50.740
 knocked off and as I said if 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:52.150
 gerd 

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:54.400
 winning 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:56.820
 then the swiss world champion is out 

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:56.820
 frauenfeld 

00:04:56.980 --> 00:04:59.250
 With 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:02.600
 Well 

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:03.960
 he prepared himself 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:04.830
 personally 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:06.630
 red 

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:09.150
 in training the fastest and here 

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:11.250
 maybe the happiest in the end 

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:15.780
 the best the others are bad 

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:18.139
 could have had fared mass 

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:19.790
 of course , the title 

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:21.630
 37 

00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:24.810
 is old 

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:26.460
 often stood in the final 

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:29.030
 to the title 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:29.030
 never enough 

00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:35.200
 is attacked the 

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:37.680
 from the number four 

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:39.620
 a classmate 

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:41.930
 karachi 

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:43.850
 would have to win to become world champion 

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:47.770
 and plug in that 

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:47.770
 we are in the last round 

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:53.740
 Kamal knocked it third leads 

00:05:51.159 --> 00:05:58.080
 but do it 

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:58.080
 the cargo markram 

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:02.820
 kammeyer could still have a seat 

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:05.370
 make up for it, but that will not be enough 

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:06.440
 We do not care about this accident of the goalie 

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:08.780
 out 

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:11.510
 he looked and said before the final 

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:14.470
 do not play the rehearsal well and healthy 

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:14.470
 come home 

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:22.010
 second knight 

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:28.390
 we will be considered the winner here 

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:31.390
 also comes with iran 

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:34.570
 an exciting finale 

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:37.030
 world championship before hand is mine 

00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:38.110
 decided day and here is natural 

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:41.320
 the cheers are great 

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:46.290
 the swiss has a big troop 

00:06:41.320 --> 00:06:46.290
 while his trailer one 

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:53.980
 here again the state of the sun 

00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:57.010
 decide balkan as well as swiss 

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:59.020
 Paul Meier second from the right is almost 

00:06:57.010 --> 00:07:01.330
 stopped or already the 

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:03.250
 World Series of have to to 

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:05.770
 tell karl meyer maybe that 

00:07:03.250 --> 00:07:10.200
 load too big left in marcel 

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:13.420
 Gerhard now they are pulling inwards 

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:16.660
 that will tell you the end there is 

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:21.220
 can go here he has a point 

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:23.100
 left gerd is bitter 13 the him today 

00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:25.060
 has not brought any luck but I believe 

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:28.570
 my ladies and gentlemen we have one 

00:07:25.060 --> 00:07:31.140
 exciting finale experiences are all 

00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:35.380
 thank goodness remained healthy 

00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:38.230
 and even if no German world champion 

00:07:35.380 --> 00:07:40.510
 we are looking forward for mass goes out 

00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:44.490
 switzerland that was off course 

00:07:40.510 --> 00:07:44.490
 back around first
