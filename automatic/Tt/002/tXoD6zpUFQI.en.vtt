00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:11.290
 burned my swivel axis or rather 

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:11.290
 rotary axis motor 

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:20.560
 which was performed using 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:29.330
 collector engine unknown 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:30.699
 power and torque of the toothed pulleys and what 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:34.910
 the most important thing 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:37.480
 sliding bearing which i 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:37.480
 pulled 

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:50.600
 to reduce the backlash and here's my sergo 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:55.119
 servomotor acquired such beautiful 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.119
 dark shades 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:14.030
 call the camera can not convey the smell 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:16.750
 because it is unimaginable worth 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.750
 burnt 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:29.530
 honors here of course still not to blame 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.950
 tuned current limiting amplifier 

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:35.110
 the need was wrong 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:44.350
 unknown what current these are calculated 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:49.080
 engines baku what we have here we have 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:49.080
 stuck and over heating 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:02:01.140
 the amplifier tried to push through increasing 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:02:04.140
 the current is such a beautiful rotor 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.140
 turned out 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:09.030
 will have to redo 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:18.500
 so 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.500
 two days mill on turning 

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:29.790
 pondering assault turned out 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:36.650
 new pivot axis is already engine with 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:36.650
 the reducer in the center of the reduction of the gene to 60 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:48.030
 connected to one cartridge 

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:48.030
 through elastic coupling 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:03:00.620
 beech 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:00.620
 so here it is spinning now 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.950
 and this is a side view
