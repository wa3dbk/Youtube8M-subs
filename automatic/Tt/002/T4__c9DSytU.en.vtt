00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:11.400
 hello says tank on this table 

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:15.599
 assembled a prototype device kapanadze 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:17.060
 which we saw video with can means 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.520
 we have 2 transformers on the table 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:22.710
 same one capacitor will 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.210
 enjoy 50 microfarad avatar 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:28.170
 Now the voltage is reduced on it 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:31.320
 a little from the voltage of your graph 

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:34.050
 will show us the voltage on 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.910
 Primary here this trance 2 probe I 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.129
 No, but the voltage will be 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.559
 identical ie load it 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:43.410
 centers 3 mattresses in the country load 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.149
 connected serial primary 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:49.110
 it is historically connected in series 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.100
 there from the league from the right to the familiar to us 5 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:55.820
 kilo watt lamps 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:01:00.660
 it will be with us oldies average but here 

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:03.870
 i.e. it is a battery, it turns out 

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:09.119
 small trustamar star bridge on 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:13.100
 Kapanadze's video is bias on 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:16.170
 a bank in a bank means two tours 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:19.770
 which contains each of its primary 

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:24.330
 and resale of these which soon as possible 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:27.810
 total total do not let me down 

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:30.860
 subject to the load of the primary croche us 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:33.540
 need to increase the number of turns 

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:37.850
 reduce their resonance resistance 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:41.159
 get started anyway now we will see how 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:44.100
 consistent resonance occurs when 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:48.630
 fully loaded shemale but also 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.079
 under magnetic direct current this 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.979
 posting 

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:56.450
 it depends on how we connect to the capacitor 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:02:02.360
 like a sport so this capacitor 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:02.360
 turn on and see how to start and knew 

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:08.909
 little god promises nothing now 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:08.909
 will start 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.020
 everything went process 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.280
 this is consistently not resonance 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:31.180
 the voltage on the capacitor is about 600 there 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:41.989
 volt on nago you're somewhere around 180 

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:46.069
 600 -180 it turns out that we have 20 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:50.480
 on each traffic 420 is entered on 

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:53.230
 the primary form of the signal they have here 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:57.670
 this is for every singers 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:59.599
 without voltage there is alternating current but current 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:02.090
 primary though transformers 

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:03.019
 permanently 1 direction constant 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:09.730
 pulsating current 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:09.730
 it does not change the direction of the magnetization 

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:15.940
 created exactly in the same direction and 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:21.129
 that's how this miracle works like this 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:26.450
 to explain 

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:34.120
 I can not yet but I guess like 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:36.470
 I will finish the computer theory while there is no 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:37.819
 if you walk differently see how 

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:40.549
 running magnetized turn on 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:44.239
 magnetization but first I would like 

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:46.940
 connect load look at 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:47.520
 the amplitude to be seen on the plate is given 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:50.930
 also 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:50.930
 primary connect the load 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:55.100
 that is, as you can see the amplitude 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:59.980
 voltage 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:59.980
 almost unchanged for jumpers 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.180
 so many times 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:04.500
 rubles some 

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.840
 a little bit 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:08.380
 Now to this eccentric I answer that 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.390
 dark 

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:19.070
 look I distinguish 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:19.070
 that's what's left 

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:26.650
 all all bye
