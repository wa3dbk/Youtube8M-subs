00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:25.560
 videos come as you can see what you are with 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:27.180
 we can do the puff pastry 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.260
 today just the dough what you to 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.859
 you need to look down in the 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.899
 description 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:35.280
 we take our flour sugar and that 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:39.600
 salt and that comes first in the all 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:42.360
 kitchen machine so first the solid 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:49.940
 components dare together the 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:49.940
 kitchen machine and then the water 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:57.000
 and then every two minutes 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:58.530
 lower level first stir mail 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.539
 not so first dust the low 

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.070
 take two minutes and wait 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.949
 then after two minutes seven minutes 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.900
 also precursor when the sea ​​is good with 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.369
 currently mixed with water 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.750
 but no homogeneous mass is like that 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.070
 a bit happy and for a loose one 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.080
 then we can do that 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.670
 machine break then again at 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.600
 high speed seven minutes 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.600
 by kneading 

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.710
 In between , the butter still likes 

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:26.149
 then the dough can still be 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.149
 knead and process better 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.380
 if the dough with nice homogeneous 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:35.670
 lumped up then we can now 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:38.039
 So take everything out now 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:41.069
 mixed now we can again briefly 

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:42.990
 a handful of her by hand 

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:44.880
 Of course, also knead everything by hand 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.219
 I took the kneading hook is one 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.450
 a bit easier but if you want more 

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:50.009
 of course, too 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:54.060
 like to lay in your hand all the time 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:57.329
 I would do that then well and good 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:58.920
 we pack now in foil and 

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:00.329
 then in the refrigerator for 30 minutes in 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.209
 foil thus had no skin 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:04.890
 forms and in the fridge must because he 

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:05.640
 nice and cool to keep him going 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.829
 to process 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.329
 you can do it the day before and 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.530
 but let the fridge 

00:02:09.329 --> 00:02:12.540
 He should be at least 30 minutes 

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.220
 let it lie so it works well 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.690
 price while you ours through the 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.260
 coolest dough lumps from the fridge 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.870
 brought 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.750
 which is now being rolled out is important 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:26.269
 doing that again the worktop one 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:26.269
 Powder that is not the dough sticks on 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:35.130
 and you can also use the rolling pin 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:38.609
 a brother with nothing on bugs so then 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:41.100
 you roll the dough as rectangular as possible 

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:43.290
 and it does not matter too 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:46.340
 rolled out so thin is about 8 mm 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.340
 strength is good 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:57.590
 then you will always follow from the middle 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:59.720
 outside everything clear as possible rectangular yes 

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:02.180
 with a lot of fantasy, it's a nice one 

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.920
 but something has rolled out here 

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:06.860
 It's okay, that's fine 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:09.110
 Now the butter comes in for it 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:11.960
 it's best to just take one piece 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:14.300
 butter commercial piece of butter and 

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:17.510
 cuts it in pieces so easy 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:21.740
 as thin as possible pieces of butter down 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:25.010
 Now cut to the side lay what's important 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:28.550
 is that the butter be quite cold 

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:30.140
 he must to should be the same 

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:31.280
 temperature as the participation of the tiger 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:33.350
 come out of the fridge 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.850
 So let the butter stay in as long as possible 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:37.870
 You want to use the refrigerator 

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:40.430
 take them out just before 

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.780
 and then that should be with the leader 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:43.550
 Technique everything works well 

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:45.920
 Before her mother is under the dough 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:48.800
 draws stops the dough in any case from 

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:51.460
 so that it dries out completely 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:54.350
 important so so excess more 

00:03:51.460 --> 00:03:56.540
 Dust and then he takes the dough 

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:58.730
 Simply place like a pizza, so to speak 

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:00.340
 the mother just beautiful tight 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:02.480
 together 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.950
 centered and to the right 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:06.350
 and left with the place is because we 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:07.820
 have to fold the same day and that 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:09.710
 works best if I'm mother everywhere 

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:11.120
 is the direction you can go to 

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:12.040
 edge should only place right and left should 

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:14.780
 be this place 

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:18.820
 then the dough is folded into a jähnigen 

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:23.120
 just the end lies that over here 

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:25.960
 that concludes that over this then the whole 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:29.950
 Dust again 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:32.710
 wrapping in foil 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:33.310
 and for 30 minutes in the fridge it 

00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:35.170
 continues 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:36.610
 next the dough is rolled out 

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:38.040
 I've got that back for that 

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:40.630
 brought refrigerator 

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:43.600
 we'll pack him cool on the 

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:46.090
 work surface important again 

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:47.740
 Roll it out is that you can not do it once 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:50.890
 too thin, so clean up again 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:52.420
 about eight millimeters and then always 

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:54.990
 working in one direction only 

00:04:52.420 --> 00:05:00.790
 do not make dough layers 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:05:06.100
 So I speak now of the 

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:18.520
 middle outward again as possible 

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:20.710
 Rectangular roll out the dough is now 

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:21.820
 now we fold it out 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:23.350
 second time will be a bit different 

00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:25.030
 like as the first time and that 

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:27.130
 you take this from the side here 

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:30.040
 pieces to the middle where of the other 

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:31.330
 a long way then ran up and 

00:05:30.040 --> 00:05:31.980
 then you switch the whole thing again 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:34.660
 together 

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:36.480
 now scent packed again and must 

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:39.310
 again 30 minutes in the fridge 

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:40.570
 then it is rolled out again and the 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:42.370
 starts from the beginning 

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:44.080
 So fold like the first time then 

00:05:42.370 --> 00:05:46.570
 again 30 minutes the fridge and 

00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:49.480
 then fold like just now and then 

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:52.180
 again in the fridge people day finished 

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:53.830
 after four passes roll out 

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:55.750
 fold in the fridge from pollenfeld in 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:56.950
 I finished the fridge the dough 

00:05:55.750 --> 00:06:00.070
 I've mentioned it now 

00:05:56.950 --> 00:06:01.030
 Look again must be able to look here 

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:05.770
 you quite recognize the 

00:06:01.030 --> 00:06:07.540
 different layers could be the part 

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:08.680
 now process in comparison or her 

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:10.480
 peace and processed 

00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:12.730
 A few days later I hope it has
