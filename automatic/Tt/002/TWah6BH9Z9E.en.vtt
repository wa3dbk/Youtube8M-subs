00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
i think that overall in runescape I

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:28.600 
i think that overall in runescape I
think<00:02:25.110> that<00:02:25.370> Americans<00:02:26.370> are<00:02:26.700> better<00:02:27.060> because

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
because I just feel like better probably

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:34.070 
because I just feel like better probably
have<00:02:31.350> more<00:02:31.590> stuff<00:02:32.010> but<00:02:32.820> there's<00:02:33.450> I'm<00:02:33.900> going<00:02:34.020> to

who's best at what so I think for
example<00:02:38.370> I<00:02:38.880> think<00:02:38.910> probably<00:02:40.100> Europeans<00:02:41.100> are

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280

are<00:02:42.240> better<00:02:42.510> p<00:02:42.780> cares<00:02:43.050> definitely<00:02:43.620> I<00:02:43.650> think

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:43.770 
are better p cares definitely I think

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:46.610 
are better p cares definitely I think
better<00:02:44.160> hybrid<00:02:44.820> or<00:02:44.970> I'm<00:02:45.510> gonna<00:02:45.720> go<00:02:45.810> definitely

with Europeans are definitely definitely
in<00:02:49.710> my<00:02:49.860> opinion<00:02:50.160> better<00:02:50.550> hybridus<00:02:51.360> I'm<00:02:51.600> gonna

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.170 
in my opinion better hybridus I'm gonna

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.530 
in my opinion better hybridus I'm gonna

know<00:06:30.040> they<00:06:30.160> mean<00:06:30.370> but<00:06:30.880> for<00:06:31.090> my<00:06:31.210> own<00:06:31.240> personal

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:31.600 
know they mean but for my own personal

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:34.400 
know they mean but for my own personal
experience<00:06:31.900> is<00:06:32.410> over<00:06:32.830> all<00:06:33.010> I'm<00:06:33.670> going<00:06:33.880> to<00:06:33.940> say

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:34.410 
experience is over all I'm going to say

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:38.010 
experience is over all I'm going to say
Americans<00:06:35.410> are<00:06:35.590> better<00:06:36.150> at<00:06:37.150> runescape

00:06:38.010 --> 00:06:38.020 
Americans are better at runescape

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:39.670 
Americans are better at runescape
because<00:06:38.860> PK

00:06:39.670 --> 00:06:39.680 
because PK

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:42.040 
because PK
is<00:06:39.770> not<00:06:40.039> the<00:06:40.580> biggest<00:06:40.970> part<00:06:41.210> of<00:06:41.360> runescape

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:42.050 
is not the biggest part of runescape

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:44.140 
is not the biggest part of runescape
skilling<00:06:42.919> is<00:06:43.009> probably<00:06:43.310> the<00:06:43.460> bigger<00:06:43.669> part<00:06:43.970> of

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:44.150 
skilling is probably the bigger part of

00:06:44.150 --> 00:06:46.719 
skilling is probably the bigger part of
runescape<00:06:44.690> in<00:06:44.810> all<00:06:44.930> honesty<00:06:45.530> and<00:06:45.740> I<00:06:46.490> think

00:06:46.719 --> 00:06:46.729 
runescape in all honesty and I think

00:06:46.729 --> 00:06:48.700 
runescape in all honesty and I think
that<00:06:46.940> from<00:06:47.449> my<00:06:47.570> personal<00:06:47.990> experience<00:06:48.139> is<00:06:48.590> the

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:48.710 
that from my personal experience is the

00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:50.620 
that from my personal experience is the
Americans<00:06:49.190> are<00:06:49.310> much<00:06:49.490> better<00:06:49.669> at<00:06:49.789> that<00:06:50.060> but<00:06:50.600> i

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:50.630 
Americans are much better at that but i

00:06:50.630 --> 00:06:53.620 
Americans are much better at that but i
will<00:06:50.870> say<00:06:51.139> that<00:06:51.169> definitely<00:06:52.539> europeans<00:06:53.539> are

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:53.630 
will say that definitely europeans are

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:55.420 
will say that definitely europeans are
so<00:06:53.870> much<00:06:54.020> better<00:06:54.169> i<00:06:54.320> think<00:06:54.590> at<00:06:54.710> peking<00:06:55.130> I
