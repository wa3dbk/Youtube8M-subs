our<00:00:51.449> battle<00:00:52.050> at<00:00:52.170> the<00:00:52.289> end<00:00:52.440> and<00:00:52.850> that's<00:00:53.850> a

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
our battle at the end and that's a

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.209 
our battle at the end and that's a
perfect<00:00:54.480> perfect<00:00:54.809> scenario<00:00:55.230> but<00:00:56.039> I<00:00:56.100> know

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
perfect perfect scenario but I know

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:59.029 
perfect perfect scenario but I know
there's<00:00:56.460> a<00:00:56.550> lot<00:00:56.579> of<00:00:56.730> strong<00:00:57.469> riders<00:00:58.469> this<00:00:58.739> year

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
there's a lot of strong riders this year

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.160 
there's a lot of strong riders this year
and<00:00:59.219> that<00:01:00.149> it's<00:01:00.329> going<00:01:00.480> to<00:01:00.570> be<00:01:00.660> tough<00:01:00.840> for<00:01:01.050> that

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:01.170 
and that it's going to be tough for that

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.470 
and that it's going to be tough for that
to<00:01:01.260> happen<00:01:01.410> so<00:01:01.620> well<00:01:02.370> I'm<00:01:02.520> gonna<00:01:02.670> try<00:01:02.969> and<00:01:03.149> try

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
to happen so well I'm gonna try and try

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.270 
to happen so well I'm gonna try and try
and<00:01:03.510> get<00:01:03.660> out<00:01:03.780> fast<00:01:03.809> and<00:01:04.379> I'm<00:01:04.650> traditionally<00:01:05.250> a

and get out fast and I'm traditionally a

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.370 
and get out fast and I'm traditionally a
terrible<00:01:05.700> starter<00:01:06.030> but<00:01:06.210> I've<00:01:06.810> learned<00:01:06.869> little

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
terrible starter but I've learned little

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.960 
terrible starter but I've learned little
tricks<00:01:07.650> and<00:01:07.920> I<00:01:08.100> one<00:01:08.250> last<00:01:08.490> time<00:01:08.640> on<00:01:08.790> that

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
tricks and I one last time on that

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.520 
tricks and I one last time on that
course<00:01:09.210> happened<00:01:09.840> to<00:01:09.900> be<00:01:09.990> a<00:01:10.020> little<00:01:10.170> bit<00:01:10.320> drier

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
course happened to be a little bit drier

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.219 
course happened to be a little bit drier
those<00:01:10.799> probably<00:01:11.520> be<00:01:11.640> my<00:01:11.760> fourth<00:01:12.270> fourth

you're going to get on race day and it
doesn't<00:01:31.710> really<00:01:31.860> help<00:01:32.189> to<00:01:32.280> worry<00:01:32.579> about<00:01:32.729> it

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
doesn't really help to worry about it

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.510 
doesn't really help to worry about it
you<00:01:33.659> need<00:01:33.840> to<00:01:33.930> be<00:01:34.020> prepared<00:01:34.229> for<00:01:34.770> any<00:01:35.189> kind<00:01:35.400> of

I mean you know five degrees difference

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.700 
I mean you know five degrees difference
can<00:01:56.939> make<00:01:56.969> a<00:01:57.149> huge<00:01:57.479> difference<00:01:58.140> in<00:01:58.500> what

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
can make a huge difference in what

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:06.570 
gloves headgear because 32 degrees is a

lot different than you know 24 degrees
and<00:02:09.239> that's<00:02:09.500> not<00:02:10.500> huge
