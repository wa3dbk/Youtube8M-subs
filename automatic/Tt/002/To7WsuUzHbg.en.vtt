00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:33.080 
so that's he's the one who said that in

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:38.780 
so that's he's the one who said that in
the<00:05:33.140> beginning<00:05:33.470> the<00:05:33.530> game

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:38.790 

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:41.240 

they're<00:05:39.300> as<00:05:39.510> awesome<00:05:40.260> now<00:05:40.380> that<00:05:40.680> is<00:05:40.980> awesome

ending<00:05:41.670> right<00:05:41.970> there<00:05:42.180> that's<00:05:42.780> my<00:05:43.020> favor<00:05:43.290> and

00:05:43.400 --> 00:05:43.410 
ending right there that's my favor and

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:49.220 
ending right there that's my favor and
in<00:05:46.520> so<00:05:47.520> I<00:05:47.550> guess<00:05:47.790> this<00:05:48.030> is<00:05:48.210> a<00:05:48.240> real<00:05:48.630> ending<00:05:49.110> of

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:49.230 
in so I guess this is a real ending of

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:55.130 
in so I guess this is a real ending of
the<00:05:49.380> game<00:05:49.530> right<00:05:49.740> here<00:05:50.010> I<00:05:52.880> mean<00:05:53.880> all<00:05:54.630> of<00:05:54.690> them

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:55.140 
the game right here I mean all of them

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:57.320 
the game right here I mean all of them
could<00:05:55.320> be<00:05:55.380> ended<00:05:55.980> you<00:05:56.100> know<00:05:56.250> I<00:05:56.520> guess<00:05:57.120> the

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:57.330 
could be ended you know I guess the

00:05:57.330 --> 00:06:00.890 
could be ended you know I guess the
suicide<00:05:57.930> thing<00:05:58.260> is<00:05:58.470> more<00:05:59.340> of<00:05:59.490> a<00:05:59.520> mental<00:06:00.300> ending

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:00.900 
suicide thing is more of a mental ending

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:02.590 
suicide thing is more of a mental ending
if<00:06:01.020> you<00:06:01.110> wanna<00:06:01.290> think<00:06:01.470> about<00:06:01.560> like<00:06:01.860> that

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:02.600 
if you wanna think about like that

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:05.360 
if you wanna think about like that
because<00:06:03.600> in<00:06:03.780> the<00:06:03.900> end<00:06:04.050> it<00:06:04.590> was<00:06:04.770> all<00:06:04.920> a<00:06:04.950> mental

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:05.370 
because in the end it was all a mental

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:07.100 
because in the end it was all a mental
thing<00:06:05.400> he<00:06:05.760> was<00:06:05.880> going<00:06:06.060> crazy<00:06:06.270> and<00:06:06.780> that's<00:06:06.900> what

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:07.110 
thing he was going crazy and that's what

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:08.810 
thing he was going crazy and that's what
the<00:06:07.230> whole<00:06:07.410> story<00:06:07.440> is<00:06:07.920> about<00:06:08.190> like<00:06:08.460> he<00:06:08.610> just

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:11.090 
the whole story is about like he just
went<00:06:09.450> crazy<00:06:09.630> and<00:06:10.050> you<00:06:10.260> know<00:06:10.290> you<00:06:10.920> actually

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:53.690 
blinds are screwed up in this game for
example<00:06:50.730> the<00:06:50.940> the<00:06:51.210> x<00:06:51.390> button<00:06:51.740> you<00:06:52.740> can<00:06:52.980> you

that<00:06:56.700> never<00:06:56.910> works<00:06:57.210> out<00:06:57.450> like<00:06:57.480> that<00:06:57.810> and<00:06:57.990> the

00:06:58.460 --> 00:06:58.470 
that never works out like that and the

00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:00.140 
that never works out like that and the
vault<00:06:58.740> funds<00:06:59.130> the<00:06:59.220> same<00:06:59.430> fun<00:06:59.640> it's<00:06:59.790> a<00:06:59.850> melee

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:00.150 
vault funds the same fun it's a melee

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:03.380 
vault funds the same fun it's a melee
attack<00:07:00.180> that<00:07:01.050> never<00:07:01.500> works<00:07:01.830> out<00:07:02.040> so<00:07:02.640> if<00:07:03.180> they

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:03.390 
attack that never works out so if they

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:06.290
