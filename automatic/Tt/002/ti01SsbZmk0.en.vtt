00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060 
four different colors and so I could

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.660

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
good too because then you can tell where

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.429 
good too because then you can tell where
the<00:01:14.640> color<00:01:15.030> is<00:01:15.210> going<00:01:15.360> to<00:01:15.509> go<00:01:15.630> so<00:01:16.259> I'm<00:01:16.320> just

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
the color is going to go so I'm just

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.140 
the color is going to go so I'm just
gonna<00:01:16.530> close<00:01:16.770> my<00:01:16.860> eyes<00:01:17.009> and<00:01:17.159> really<00:01:17.850> really

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
gonna close my eyes and really really

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.600 
gonna close my eyes and really really
lightly<00:01:18.570> pull<00:01:18.990> back<00:01:19.229> so<00:01:19.650> if<00:01:19.890> this<00:01:20.009> can<00:01:20.280> go<00:01:20.460> all

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
lightly pull back so if this can go all

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.609 
lightly pull back so if this can go all
the<00:01:20.759> way<00:01:20.790> back<00:01:21.060> just<00:01:21.869> pulling<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.200> belt<00:01:22.380> to

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
the way back just pulling the belt to

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.350 
the way back just pulling the belt to
there<00:01:24.650> maybe<00:01:25.650> a<00:01:25.799> little<00:01:25.830> bit<00:01:26.130> farther<00:01:26.340> and<00:01:27.150> so

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
there maybe a little bit farther and so

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.429 
there maybe a little bit farther and so
then<00:01:27.540> just<00:01:27.900> moving<00:01:28.229> very<00:01:29.040> very<00:01:29.430> slowly<00:01:30.439> once

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
then just moving very very slowly once

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:33.800 
then just moving very very slowly once
the<00:01:31.650> air<00:01:31.799> or<00:01:32.640> once<00:01:32.820> the<00:01:32.939> product<00:01:33.329> starts<00:01:33.630> to

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:33.810 
the air or once the product starts to

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.660 
the air or once the product starts to
come<00:01:34.020> out<00:01:34.259> you'll<00:01:35.009> definitely<00:01:35.400> be<00:01:35.490> able<00:01:35.520> to

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
come out you'll definitely be able to

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.819 
come out you'll definitely be able to
feel<00:01:35.880> it<00:01:35.909> feel<00:01:36.420> it<00:01:36.479> it'll<00:01:36.900> feel<00:01:37.049> really<00:01:37.320> really

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
feel it feel it it'll feel really really

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:41.359 
feel it feel it it'll feel really really
cold<00:01:38.780> so<00:01:39.780> it's<00:01:39.930> definitely<00:01:40.320> a<00:01:40.409> strange<00:01:40.890> thing

00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:41.369 
cold so it's definitely a strange thing

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:46.920 
cold so it's definitely a strange thing
to<00:01:41.549> get<00:01:41.670> used<00:01:41.909> to

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:46.930 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:48.600 

and<00:01:47.380> so<00:01:47.560> then<00:01:47.740> you<00:01:47.860> just<00:01:47.890> start<00:01:48.280> doing<00:01:48.310> the

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:48.610 
and so then you just start doing the

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:52.440 
and so then you just start doing the
shape<00:01:48.850> that<00:01:48.880> you<00:01:49.150> want<00:01:49.180> I<00:01:51.090> want<00:01:52.090> this<00:01:52.240> to<00:01:52.390> go

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:52.450 
shape that you want I want this to go

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:54.150 
shape that you want I want this to go
all<00:01:52.690> over<00:01:52.720> my<00:01:53.080> eyes<00:01:53.290> I<00:01:53.620> don't<00:01:53.800> want<00:01:53.920> it<00:01:53.980> to<00:01:54.070> go

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:54.160 
all over my eyes I don't want it to go

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:58.410 
all over my eyes I don't want it to go
really<00:01:54.370> to<00:01:54.670> high<00:01:54.850> up<00:01:56.790> and<00:01:57.790> I'm<00:01:57.970> just<00:01:58.120> really

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:58.420

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.660 
really to high up and I'm just really
doing<00:01:58.780> this<00:01:58.900> very<00:01:59.200> very<00:01:59.440> lightly<00:01:59.740> because<00:02:00.160> I

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
doing this very very lightly because I

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:02.850 
doing this very very lightly because I
don't<00:02:00.880> want<00:02:01.060> too<00:02:01.600> much<00:02:01.780> product<00:02:02.260> to<00:02:02.530> come<00:02:02.680> on

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:02.860 
don't want too much product to come on

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:04.920 
don't want too much product to come on
to<00:02:03.010> my<00:02:03.100> eyes<00:02:03.280> another<00:02:03.970> thing<00:02:04.300> is<00:02:04.510> is<00:02:04.750> that

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:04.930 
to my eyes another thing is is that

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:06.630 
to my eyes another thing is is that
because<00:02:05.020> this<00:02:05.290> is<00:02:05.470> continuous<00:02:06.040> airflow<00:02:06.460> and

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
because this is continuous airflow and

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.090 
because this is continuous airflow and
there's<00:02:06.820> constantly<00:02:07.360> air<00:02:07.630> coming<00:02:07.930> out<00:02:08.170> if<00:02:08.500> you

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:09.100 
there's constantly air coming out if you

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:10.530 
there's constantly air coming out if you
do<00:02:09.280> put<00:02:09.460> a<00:02:09.520> little<00:02:09.729> bit<00:02:09.880> too<00:02:09.970> much<00:02:10.090> on<00:02:10.270> and<00:02:10.450> it

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:10.540 
do put a little bit too much on and it

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:12.570 
do put a little bit too much on and it
still<00:02:10.780> has<00:02:10.929> kind<00:02:11.140> of<00:02:11.170> a<00:02:11.290> wet<00:02:11.530> look<00:02:11.800> you<00:02:12.430> can

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580

something on it
it<00:06:48.760> would<00:06:48.880> work<00:06:49.000> too<00:06:49.240> another<00:06:50.050> thing<00:06:50.260> we<00:06:50.350> can

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:50.470 
it would work too another thing we can

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:52.500 
it would work too another thing we can
do<00:06:50.620> that<00:06:50.830> I<00:06:50.860> should<00:06:51.040> have<00:06:51.100> mentioned<00:06:51.310> is<00:06:51.700> when
