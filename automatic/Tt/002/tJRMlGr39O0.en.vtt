this I didn't have him in the club and
he<00:01:27.720> was<00:01:27.930> a<00:01:27.960> very<00:01:28.549> high<00:01:29.549> price<00:01:29.909> and<00:01:29.939> not<00:01:30.210> selling

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
he was a very high price and not selling

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:31.700 
he was a very high price and not selling
so<00:01:30.810> I<00:01:30.840> figured<00:01:31.170> it<00:01:31.229> would<00:01:31.350> probably<00:01:31.500> be<00:01:31.680> a

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
so I figured it would probably be a

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:33.770 
so I figured it would probably be a
waste<00:01:31.950> for<00:01:32.040> me<00:01:32.220> to<00:01:32.310> actually<00:01:32.430> get<00:01:32.850> him<00:01:32.970> so<00:01:33.689> we

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
waste for me to actually get him so we

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.120 
waste for me to actually get him so we
used<00:01:33.990> the<00:01:34.110> regular<00:01:34.439> one<00:01:34.590> and<00:01:34.619> i<00:01:34.799> must<00:01:34.950> say

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
used the regular one and i must say

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.190

lovely<00:04:41.400> ball<00:04:41.639> through<00:04:41.910> tube<00:04:42.090> a<00:04:42.180> lassie<00:04:42.539> and

00:04:43.159 --> 00:04:43.169 
lovely ball through tube a lassie and

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:44.839 
lovely ball through tube a lassie and
we're<00:04:43.349> on<00:04:43.380> to<00:04:43.620> his<00:04:43.830> clips<00:04:44.190> for<00:04:44.430> this<00:04:44.550> video

00:04:44.839 --> 00:04:44.849 
we're on to his clips for this video

00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:47.900 
we're on to his clips for this video
right<00:04:45.090> now<00:04:45.150> he's<00:04:45.810> absolutely<00:04:46.530> rapid<00:04:47.340> I<00:04:47.520> think

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:47.910 
right now he's absolutely rapid I think

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:50.480 
right now he's absolutely rapid I think
that<00:04:48.000> I<00:04:48.120> probably<00:04:48.770> didn't<00:04:49.770> get<00:04:49.889> the<00:04:50.039> best<00:04:50.250> out

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:50.490 
that I probably didn't get the best out

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:52.070 
that I probably didn't get the best out
of<00:04:50.520> him<00:04:50.639> simply<00:04:50.970> because<00:04:51.120> I<00:04:51.389> was<00:04:51.630> playing<00:04:51.900> him

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 
of him simply because I was playing him

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.050 
of him simply because I was playing him
at<00:04:52.139> six<00:04:52.410> or<00:04:52.590> seven<00:04:52.919> chemistry<00:04:53.400> at<00:04:53.550> stryker

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:54.060 
at six or seven chemistry at stryker

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:56.870 
at six or seven chemistry at stryker
whereas<00:04:54.870> of<00:04:55.080> course<00:04:55.110> left<00:04:55.710> forward<00:04:56.130> in<00:04:56.250> a<00:04:56.340> 4312

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:56.880 
whereas of course left forward in a 4312

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.510 
whereas of course left forward in a 4312
would<00:04:57.810> probably<00:04:58.349> be<00:04:58.500> his<00:04:58.740> best<00:04:58.979> bet<00:04:59.250> like

00:04:59.510 --> 00:04:59.520 
would probably be his best bet like

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:01.460 
would probably be his best bet like
seriously<00:04:59.970> I<00:05:00.030> reckon<00:05:00.419> you'll<00:05:00.570> you'll<00:05:01.020> do<00:05:01.229> some

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:01.470 
seriously I reckon you'll you'll do some

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:03.680 
seriously I reckon you'll you'll do some
absolute<00:05:02.039> damage<00:05:02.400> maybe<00:05:02.610> have<00:05:02.910> him<00:05:02.940> one<00:05:03.360> side

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:03.690 
absolute damage maybe have him one side

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:06.260 
absolute damage maybe have him one side

up<00:05:22.830> he<00:05:23.070> was<00:05:23.099> extinct<00:05:23.639> on<00:05:23.729> the<00:05:23.820> market<00:05:24.240> and<00:05:24.330> then

00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:24.479 
up he was extinct on the market and then

00:05:24.479 --> 00:05:26.330 
up he was extinct on the market and then
literally<00:05:24.780> a<00:05:24.900> day<00:05:25.080> later<00:05:25.349> he<00:05:25.680> had<00:05:26.159> dropped

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:26.340 
literally a day later he had dropped

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:27.920 
literally a day later he had dropped
about<00:05:26.550> 40k<00:05:27.180> and<00:05:27.360> he<00:05:27.419> was<00:05:27.569> completely

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:27.930 
about 40k and he was completely

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:30.260 
about 40k and he was completely
saturated<00:05:28.530> so<00:05:28.800> god<00:05:29.370> knows<00:05:29.400> what<00:05:29.729> his<00:05:29.849> prices

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:30.270 
saturated so god knows what his prices

00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:32.510 
saturated so god knows what his prices
by<00:05:30.449> now<00:05:30.659> but<00:05:30.840> I<00:05:30.900> reckon<00:05:31.259> it's<00:05:31.380> under<00:05:31.650> 100k<00:05:32.070> and

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:32.520 
by now but I reckon it's under 100k and

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:34.520 
by now but I reckon it's under 100k and
