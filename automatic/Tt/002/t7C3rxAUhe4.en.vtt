00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:07.500
 Hello 

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.300
 in the following video we will give you 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.790
 explain from which components the 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.650
 Playstation 4 is what they can do 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.139
 and above all why the 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.570
 developer playstation 4 we have such a 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.760
 keep a great console 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:22.350
 how exactly the playstation 4 looks like this 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.150
 we do not know yet because sony has 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.010
 bit calm images of the controllers 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:28.970
 dualshock 4 and the camera 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:31.410
 published what we know, however 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.180
 is like the hardware inside the 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.329
 Playstation 4 looks at least in 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.770
 divide 

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:40.050
 so does the playstation 4 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.520
 the graphics core next architecture the 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.840
 For example, in the current 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:48.960
 Radiance is a matter of course 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.840
 sony redesigned this architecture so 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:54.180
 offer, for example, the l1 and l2 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.940
 caches the possibility of being skipped too 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.430
 so that the graphics unit directly 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.789
 write in common memory 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.800
 can 

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.809
 this is the graphics unit shares with 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.880
 the processor later on 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.650
 a bit more 

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:11.040
 the graphics unit of the playstation 4 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:14.729
 offers 18 so-called computer units what 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:18.210
 in 1152 shader units results the 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:20.070
 clocked with 800 megahertz there 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.650
 especially the calculation of 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:25.830
 general information so-called 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.479
 Compute is particularly important has sony 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.689
 the comment section clearly 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:34.610
 Drilled up to 64 slots are available 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:36.540
 and perform compute calculations 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:38.400
 next to the graphics core next 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:41.009
 Graphics unit decreed chip of 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:43.710
 Playstation 4 via two computer units 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:47.369
 based on amd fx 86 jaguar 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:50.220
 technology which supports 64 bit per 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:52.530
 Computer units are four processor cores 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.479
 ready the over a common two 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:55.430
 megabyte big level 2 cache 

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:58.560
 communicate 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:00.600
 this architecture is actually low 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:04.409
 power systems designed for example 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:07.759
 even notebooks or tablets allow it 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.759
 but very efficient 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:13.760
 the actual clou of the playstation 4 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:15.590
 not only is the gpu and the cdu 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:17.480
 sitting in a common chips 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.460
 but that both also on one 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.530
 shared memory can access 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:25.640
 the communication on these so-called 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:29.810
 Unified memory is done by means of a 256 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:32.180
 bit wide interface with 2750 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:35.450
 megahertz is clocked accordingly 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.700
 are 176 g at transfer rates to 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:39.380
 disposal 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:41.300
 purely from the technical data 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:43.489
 this bandwidth in combination with the 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:46.940
 shader units in about what's on 

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:49.450
 desktop sold as radeon hd 7000 850 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.680
 Of course there will be 64 bit as well 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.810
 because these first allow it 

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.480
 a total of eight gigabytes of gddr5 memory 

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.950
 to address 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.930
 of these eight gigabytes is indeed one 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.670
 Part reserved for the operating system 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:03.800
 Nonetheless, there is a lot 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:05.230
 Memory available to the gpu and cpu 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.010
 to be able to use 

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.040
 Normally the communication takes place 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:11.200
 between these two components 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.880
 using the pci express interface 

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:16.549
 which takes a long time and of course 

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:18.830
 Energy costs all data 

00:03:16.549 --> 00:03:20.299
 first from one part to another 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:21.260
 and forth to be copied with it 

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:25.070
 can be expected 

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:28.040
 in the case of unified memory this is 

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:30.019
 no longer necessary because the gpu and 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.880
 cpu can work together on the same 

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:34.580
 memory access and the respectively 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:36.170
 each other's data of the other chips 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:38.630
 edit directly 

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:41.329
 in the desktop area we are here 

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:43.850
 the optimal platform the architecture 

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:46.010
 Integration does not follow until late autumn 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:48.970
 or winter with carey in case of 

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:51.200
 Playstation 4 is already on toni 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:53.150
 accordingly it is possible by point 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:55.400
 on the common storage area 

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:58.299
 to access and thus the copy 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:01.610
 to save effort 

00:03:58.299 --> 00:04:02.480
 here in the picture is a short of a cabin 

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:04.760
 to see chips 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:07.790
 this joins a jaguar compute 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:10.730
 units with two compute units based on 

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:13.760
 the tcn architecture the whole in big 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:14.209
 result in approximately the chip of the playstation 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.459
 4 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:19.420
 but then with two compute units 

00:04:16.459 --> 00:04:22.980
 for the processor part and equal to 8 

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:25.510
 computer units for the graphics unit 

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:27.700
 next to the shared storage area 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:30.850
 is the trick of the playstation 4 in it 

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:32.740
 that the amd allowed next to the gpu and 

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:34.330
 the cpu cores even more 

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.190
 functional units in the chip too 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:37.690
 integrate 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:40.450
 such as is a dedicated 

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:43.390
 solution only for the calculation of audio 

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:45.750
 responsible one only charges the 

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:49.900
 decoding of videos for example 

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:51.670
 for in game scenes and a chip is only 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:53.830
 responsible for data 

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:55.870
 for example, they decompress 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:58.930
 lying on the hard disk or the the 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:01.720
 on the blu-ray are also the 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:04.510
 background screaming explains done 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:06.850
 a single chip stands accordingly 

00:05:04.510 --> 00:05:10.240
 almost the complete memory and almost 

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:12.430
 the complete bandwidth only for the cpu 

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:14.140
 and the gpu available and these 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:16.300
 do not with their computing services 

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:18.220
 additional tasks like the audio 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:20.850
 calculation or decoration 

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:25.000
 waste 

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:28.420
 the disadvantage of the playstation 4 is the 

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:31.480
 memory bandwidth for the 176 gb 

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:32.620
 need the cpu and gpu as already 

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:34.990
 to share mentioned 

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:38.440
 the alternative would have been the bus of 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:40.060
 256 bit to 128 and so on 

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:42.070
 so-called discovered the heat so 

00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:42.610
 extremely fast and chip memory too 

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:44.020
 obstruct 

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:45.790
 the developers did, however 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:48.370
 decided against there is at least for 

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:49.690
 games programmer is easier on 

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:50.770
 a large shared memory 

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:54.250
 access 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:57.900
 as between shared memory and 

00:05:54.250 --> 00:05:59.800
 the embedded to distinguish this 

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:02.560
 summarized one can say that the 

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:05.140
 Playstation 4 purely technological the pc 

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:07.330
 is clearly ahead and accordingly 

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:10.210
 despite supposedly only middle class 

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:12.220
 Hardware specifications a huge 

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:13.720
 will make a leap forward what will be 

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:16.600
 in a much higher graphical 

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:18.430
 The quality of the game results 

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:20.290
 itself, for example, has the 

00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:23.200
 Performance advantage of unified memory 

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:24.670
 at almost 30 percent , it's around 

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:26.200
 one third more power alone 

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:28.420
 in that the pci express 

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:31.000
 interface between cpu and gpu 

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:32.030
 Accordingly, we are very much 

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.010
 looking forward to him 

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:35.750
 games for the playstation 4 and before 

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:37.880
 all things synonymous as the corresponding 

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:39.170
 pc portations fail because the pc 

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:41.450
 of course there are also graphics core 

00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:45.830
 next there is also the x86 architecture 

00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:47.920
 from amd june falls memory also comes and 

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:49.340
 64 bit has been around for some time 

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:51.500
 Accordingly, it is for developers 

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:55.450
 easy to port and hopefully 

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:55.450
 this benefits the entire market
