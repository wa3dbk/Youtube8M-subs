 portal glass and finger 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:13.589
 all mobile entertainment ah on 

00:00:10.749 --> 00:00:13.589
 glafi.com 

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:21.220
 and hello to all friends with you again I 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:24.520
 huskies rusher and today we speak and tanks 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:27.910
 tiger 2 is ours like a tiger alone 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:31.000
 tiger 2 so we went about what today 

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:33.880
 We know firstly what we changed 

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.430
 tiger 2 along with its tanks exactly 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.870
 fellow tiger-1 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:40.690
 look at its distinguishing features 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:42.430
 comparing with his classmates such 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:47.230
 as is-3 and t34 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:49.809
 lion and others and talk about his principle 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:52.089
 the most positive trait is worth it 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:54.970
 generally pumped or pass it for 

00:00:52.089 --> 00:00:57.940
 free experience like some tanks such 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:01:01.390
 how t95 well about her in general, even the words are not 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:04.449
 Need to say so let's go our tiger 2 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:07.260
 comparing with his little fellow 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:09.760
 tiger 1 already has some 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:13.120
 booking about it tells us yourself 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:15.250
 tth we forehead is armored 150 millimeters 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:18.220
 but the boards are the same cardboard 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:23.110
 and by 2 millimeters tank than the tank 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:26.110
 tiger 1 namely 80 millimeters board and 80 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:28.510
 millimeters pocket tower we have a mask 

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:30.270
 armored herself very well and even 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:35.070
 there and and most 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:37.720
 do not penetrate such tanks as level 8 and 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:40.060
 most of the seventh levels like this 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:43.870
 Now you will not see the mass 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:46.780
 ricochets and no penetrations are all about what 

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:48.790
 we forehead is armored 85 millimeters a 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.270
 if we substitute it for good 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:52.150
 by the corner 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:54.850
 it is almost impossible to break through 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:57.640
 This is from the top tower they are with stock as 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:00.070
 Here, for example , the opposite tiger 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.990
 second he had a stock tower 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:04.600
 She's there at all cardboard about her at all. 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.400
 do n't even talk besides 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:09.610
 other things we have a stock here 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:13.120
 strengths of 1600 units that's 200 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:16.410
 units more than the tank t-34 and 100 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:20.230
 units larger than regular IS-3 tank 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:23.050
 rs6 I will not even speak with us here 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:25.719
 over past all this good there 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:26.270
 What kind of speakers do we have? 

00:02:25.719 --> 00:02:28.490
 c 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:32.210
 them at 38 kilometers per hour maximum 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:33.890
 speed with mass in the 70th I want you 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:36.260
 say that its thirty kilometers in 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:38.870
 an hour he is gaining justified quite himself 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:41.630
 cheerfully though he has a 700 horse engine 

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.460
 forces but for this tank its quite a 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:46.670
 enough but probably because we 

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:48.350
 there is no reservation here at all 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:52.940
 break through such tanks as 

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:55.160
 Seventh level 8 9 and even more so 10 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:58.460
 by the way with a dozen we are like ordinary 

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:01.040
 regular tanks gets and there I want 

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:03.830
 say tiger 2 feels quite 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:06.920
 he feels good because he is breaking through 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:10.370
 his top gun makes ordinary 

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:13.360
 projectile 225 millimeters and subcaliber 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:17.120
 already in 285 and I will tell you 

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:20.300
 really good 285 charge gold 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:24.200
 we can live peacefully in the tower tank 

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:27.050
 e-100 and these are friends just fine well 

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:29.540
 definitely good plus we have here 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:31.970
 any good rate of fire 

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:35.840
 as for a heavy tank five and a half 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:37.160
 shots per minute + rammer will be 6 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.130
 we are with 100 percent 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:42.770
 crews, respectively, time information 

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:46.550
 us 2 and 3 seconds with enhanced drives 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:49.790
 pickups will be 19 this for heavy 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:53.840
 the tank is quite a fit plus a good 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:56.660
 scatter 0 34 meters per 100 meters of this 

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:59.150
 also quite enough by itself 

00:03:56.660 --> 00:04:01.940
 I feel like a tank 

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:03.770
 imagine a good tank, I do not advise you 

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:07.250
 deflate it for free experience 

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:11.120
 buy it pass it and feel the tank 

00:04:07.250 --> 00:04:13.250
 for full he is very good and with you
