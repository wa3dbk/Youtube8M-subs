I<00:00:58.590> thought<00:00:59.309> leaders<00:00:59.850> were<00:01:00.149> the<00:01:00.660> guy<00:01:00.840> that

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
I thought leaders were the guy that

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.479 
I thought leaders were the guy that
gives<00:01:01.109> commands<00:01:01.680> and<00:01:01.829> just<00:01:01.980> sit<00:01:02.100> in<00:01:02.190> a<00:01:02.219> corner

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
gives commands and just sit in a corner

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.270 
gives commands and just sit in a corner
and<00:01:02.640> do<00:01:02.789> nothing<00:01:02.940> but<00:01:03.780> leader<00:01:04.320> is<00:01:04.680> an<00:01:04.920> example

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
and do nothing but leader is an example

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.580 
and do nothing but leader is an example
for<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:05.939> people<00:01:06.150> this<00:01:06.810> class<00:01:07.140> had<00:01:07.350> taught<00:01:07.560> me

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
for the people this class had taught me

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:11.210 
for the people this class had taught me
to<00:01:08.010> become<00:01:08.850> a<00:01:09.210> better<00:01:09.570> leader<00:01:09.990> rather<00:01:10.680> than<00:01:10.830> a

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
to become a better leader rather than a

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:14.450 
to become a better leader rather than a
leader<00:01:11.790> that<00:01:11.820> this<00:01:12.150> commands<00:01:12.630> people<00:01:13.340> in<00:01:14.340> so
