along the way who suggested that I use
this<00:01:34.290> stuff<00:01:34.530> and<00:01:34.799> she<00:01:35.070> actually<00:01:35.220> had<00:01:35.460> a<00:01:35.490> bunch

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
this stuff and she actually had a bunch

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:38.149

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
forward I was hooked now I know that

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.950 
forward I was hooked now I know that
sucralose<00:01:41.400> and<00:01:41.880> I<00:01:42.150> don't<00:01:42.600> know<00:01:42.689> if<00:01:42.780> there's

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
aspartame in this one I don't think

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:45.859 
aspartame in this one I don't think
there<00:01:44.820> is<00:01:44.909> I<00:01:45.060> think<00:01:45.090> it's<00:01:45.360> just<00:01:45.479> sucralose

00:01:45.859 --> 00:01:45.869 
there is I think it's just sucralose

there is I think it's just sucralose
whatever<00:01:46.520> obviously<00:01:47.520> artificial<00:01:48.210> sweeteners

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:55.340 
know that but in terms of a survival
situation<00:01:53.310> and<00:01:53.939> the<00:01:54.149> few<00:01:54.720> times<00:01:54.960> a<00:01:55.140> year<00:01:55.320> that

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
you might actually go out on a

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:58.459 
you might actually go out on a
backpacking<00:01:57.329> trip<00:01:57.360> that<00:01:57.719> might<00:01:57.899> warrant<00:01:58.140> this

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
I definitely check it out I don't

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.500 
I definitely check it out I don't
promote<00:02:32.129> any<00:02:32.400> particular<00:02:33.000> brand<00:02:33.150> to<00:02:33.390> these

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:33.510 
promote any particular brand to these

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:34.699 
promote any particular brand to these
I'm<00:02:33.720> sure<00:02:33.900> there's<00:02:34.079> a<00:02:34.170> thousand<00:02:34.560> and<00:02:34.680> one

00:02:34.699 --> 00:02:34.709 
I'm sure there's a thousand and one

00:02:34.709 --> 00:02:37.220 
I'm sure there's a thousand and one
brands<00:02:35.099> nowadays<00:02:35.640> but<00:02:36.269> they're<00:02:36.510> very<00:02:36.720> small

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
brands nowadays but they're very small

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.589 
brands nowadays but they're very small
and<00:02:37.439> compact<00:02:37.859> thirty<00:02:38.519> portions<00:02:39.060> in<00:02:39.239> this<00:02:39.390> one

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599 
and compact thirty portions in this one

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:42.199

so<00:02:40.079> thirty<00:02:40.829> cups<00:02:41.129> I<00:02:41.340> think<00:02:41.549> so<00:02:41.760> that<00:02:41.790> goes<00:02:42.180> a

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:42.209 
so thirty cups I think so that goes a

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:43.479 
so thirty cups I think so that goes a
long<00:02:42.450> way<00:02:42.689> and<00:02:42.840> it's<00:02:42.959> very<00:02:43.139> lightweight

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:43.489 
long way and it's very lightweight

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:45.649 
long way and it's very lightweight
anyways<00:02:44.489> I<00:02:44.609> hope<00:02:44.760> this<00:02:44.909> has<00:02:45.090> been<00:02:45.120> useful<00:02:45.420> to
