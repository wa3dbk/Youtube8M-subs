I found that the Black Label well first
off<00:00:49.530> it<00:00:49.649> is<00:00:49.680> complex

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.160 
off it is complex
it's<00:00:50.670> a<00:00:50.789> blend<00:00:51.059> it's<00:00:51.420> not<00:00:51.660> supposed<00:00:51.960> to<00:00:52.050> be

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
it's a blend it's not supposed to be

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.260

everything<00:00:52.590> you<00:00:52.710> see<00:00:53.010> all<00:00:53.399> at<00:00:53.820> once<00:00:54.059> it

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
everything you see all at once it

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.150 
everything you see all at once it
shouldn't<00:00:54.570> just<00:00:54.600> be<00:00:54.780> figured<00:00:55.410> out<00:00:55.590> by<00:00:55.829> just<00:00:56.039> a

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
shouldn't just be figured out by just a

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.500 
shouldn't just be figured out by just a
single<00:00:56.340> sip<00:00:56.699> that<00:00:57.090> doesn't<00:00:57.390> make<00:00:57.449> sense

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
single sip that doesn't make sense

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.029

there's<00:00:57.899> nothing<00:00:58.140> to<00:00:58.230> explore<00:00:58.649> if<00:00:58.770> that<00:00:58.920> was

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
there's nothing to explore if that was

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:00.229 
there's nothing to explore if that was
the<00:00:59.129> case<00:00:59.309> so<00:00:59.489> what<00:00:59.609> I'm<00:00:59.699> gonna<00:00:59.820> do<00:01:00.000> is<00:01:00.120> they

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.260 
just used a little water in here I
didn't<00:01:40.920> do<00:01:40.979> anything<00:01:41.250> crazy<00:01:41.460> and<00:01:41.759> when<00:01:42.240> I

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:42.270 
didn't do anything crazy and when I

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.020 
didn't do anything crazy and when I
found<00:01:42.540> is<00:01:42.689> that<00:01:42.810> it<00:01:43.049> is<00:01:43.259> complex<00:01:43.710> it<00:01:44.640> isn't

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
found is that it is complex it isn't

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.730 
found is that it is complex it isn't
easy<00:01:45.180> to<00:01:45.329> discern<00:01:45.750> and<00:01:46.049> I<00:01:46.170> think<00:01:46.409> that's<00:01:46.590> the

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
easy to discern and I think that's the

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.850 
easy to discern and I think that's the
purpose<00:01:47.009> if<00:01:47.610> you're<00:01:48.149> just<00:01:48.240> gonna<00:01:48.329> make<00:01:48.540> a

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:48.860 
purpose if you're just gonna make a

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.380 
purpose if you're just gonna make a
whisky<00:01:49.860> a<00:01:50.009> scotch<00:01:50.430> that<00:01:50.759> you<00:01:51.090> could<00:01:51.210> figure

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
whisky a scotch that you could figure

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.469 
whisky a scotch that you could figure
out<00:01:51.770> just<00:01:52.770> right<00:01:53.189> up<00:01:53.369> front<00:01:53.640> but<00:01:54.119> what's<00:01:54.329> the

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
out just right up front but what's the

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.510 
out just right up front but what's the
point<00:01:54.659> I<00:01:54.990> don't<00:01:55.710> understand<00:01:56.219> it's<00:01:56.369> like

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
point I don't understand it's like

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.219 
point I don't understand it's like
meeting<00:01:56.729> a<00:01:56.880> nice<00:01:57.060> woman<00:01:57.420> if<00:01:57.750> you<00:01:57.840> meet<00:01:58.020> a<00:01:58.049> woman

something<00:02:09.119> complex<00:02:09.629> something<00:02:10.170> you're<00:02:10.319> going

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:10.410 
something complex something you're going

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:12.140 
something complex something you're going
to<00:02:10.500> stay<00:02:10.679> with<00:02:10.860> it<00:02:10.920> you<00:02:11.069> can<00:02:11.190> come<00:02:11.400> back<00:02:11.610> to<00:02:11.910> and

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
to stay with it you can come back to and

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.620 
to stay with it you can come back to and
learn<00:02:12.540> something<00:02:12.780> new<00:02:12.989> each<00:02:13.230> time

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:13.630 
learn something new each time

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.870 
learn something new each time
you<00:02:13.720> you<00:02:14.230> take<00:02:14.440> a<00:02:14.470> sip<00:02:14.800> that's<00:02:15.310> what<00:02:15.580> I<00:02:15.610> think<00:02:15.820> a

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
you you take a sip that's what I think a

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.720 
you you take a sip that's what I think a
good<00:02:16.090> blended<00:02:16.720> whiskey<00:02:17.260> should<00:02:17.470> be<00:02:17.680> and<00:02:17.950> I

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
good blended whiskey should be and I

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:20.040 
good blended whiskey should be and I
think<00:02:18.970> Johnny<00:02:19.180> Walker<00:02:19.420> kind<00:02:19.720> of<00:02:19.780> brings<00:02:19.960> that

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
think Johnny Walker kind of brings that

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:23.010 
think Johnny Walker kind of brings that
is<00:02:20.290> it<00:02:20.410> the<00:02:20.500> best<00:02:20.680> $30<00:02:21.430> it's<00:02:22.420> not<00:02:22.630> that<00:02:22.810> bad<00:02:22.960> for

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:23.020 
is it the best $30 it's not that bad for

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:25.800 
is it the best $30 it's not that bad for
30<00:02:23.410> bucks<00:02:23.620> is<00:02:23.890> there<00:02:24.130> better<00:02:24.280> probably<00:02:25.240> but

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
30 bucks is there better probably but

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:29.310 
30 bucks is there better probably but
what<00:02:26.580> what<00:02:27.580> do<00:02:27.640> you<00:02:27.670> want<00:02:27.820> to<00:02:27.970> get<00:02:28.150> from<00:02:28.390> it<00:02:28.420> for

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:29.320 
what what do you want to get from it for

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:30.930 
what what do you want to get from it for
$30<00:02:29.860> you're<00:02:30.010> kind<00:02:30.190> of<00:02:30.220> getting<00:02:30.430> a<00:02:30.490> lot<00:02:30.670> and<00:02:30.880> I

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
$30 you're kind of getting a lot and I

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:32.850 
$30 you're kind of getting a lot and I
think<00:02:31.000> that's<00:02:31.810> why<00:02:32.020> Johnny<00:02:32.380> Walker<00:02:32.620> Black

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
think that's why Johnny Walker Black

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:34.590 
think that's why Johnny Walker Black
should<00:02:33.130> definitely<00:02:33.520> be<00:02:33.610> something<00:02:33.850> you<00:02:34.090> you

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
should definitely be something you you

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.170 
should definitely be something you you
consider<00:02:35.140> don't<00:02:35.860> look<00:02:36.130> at<00:02:36.310> it<00:02:36.400> as<00:02:36.520> I<00:02:36.760> want

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
consider don't look at it as I want

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:38.790 
consider don't look at it as I want
something<00:02:37.510> that<00:02:37.630> has<00:02:37.660> one<00:02:38.050> flavor<00:02:38.380> because

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 
something that has one flavor because

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.920 
something that has one flavor because
that's<00:02:39.070> just<00:02:39.250> kind<00:02:39.340> of<00:02:39.580> lame<00:02:39.730> all<00:02:40.480> right<00:02:40.630> talk

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930
