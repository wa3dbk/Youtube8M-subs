00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:08.120 
hello it's neil ball here from work with

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:11.080 
hello it's neil ball here from work with
neil<00:00:08.270> ball<00:00:08.540> and<00:00:08.809> today<00:00:09.800> in<00:00:10.160> this<00:00:10.430> video<00:00:10.610> i'm

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:11.090 
neil ball and today in this video i'm

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:13.539 
neil ball and today in this video i'm
going<00:00:11.389> to<00:00:11.510> demonstrate<00:00:11.719> how<00:00:12.139> to<00:00:12.500> create<00:00:12.860> an

00:00:13.539 --> 00:00:13.549 
going to demonstrate how to create an

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:16.089 
going to demonstrate how to create an
image<00:00:14.180> or<00:00:14.540> a<00:00:14.600> banner<00:00:14.930> that<00:00:15.650> when<00:00:15.800> you<00:00:15.920> hover

00:00:16.089 --> 00:00:16.099 
image or a banner that when you hover

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:19.120 
image or a banner that when you hover
the<00:00:16.369> mouse<00:00:16.400> over<00:00:16.820> it<00:00:17.090> changes<00:00:17.900> in<00:00:18.560> some<00:00:18.860> way<00:00:19.070> so

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:19.130 
the mouse over it changes in some way so

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:21.250 
the mouse over it changes in some way so
for<00:00:19.520> example<00:00:19.970> if<00:00:20.029> you<00:00:20.119> take<00:00:20.300> this<00:00:20.510> this<00:00:20.960> banner

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:21.260 
for example if you take this this banner

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.010 
for example if you take this this banner
on<00:00:21.470> the<00:00:21.500> right<00:00:21.619> side<00:00:22.279> of<00:00:22.460> my<00:00:22.579> website<00:00:22.790> as<00:00:23.419> i

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:24.020 
on the right side of my website as i

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:28.030 
on the right side of my website as i
hover<00:00:24.259> over<00:00:24.470> the<00:00:25.189> mouse<00:00:26.050> forces<00:00:27.050> an<00:00:27.320> image<00:00:27.650> to

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:28.040 
hover over the mouse forces an image to

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.700 
hover over the mouse forces an image to
jet<00:00:28.310> the<00:00:28.460> thea<00:00:28.730> mister<00:00:29.090> change<00:00:29.390> like<00:00:29.689> that<00:00:29.930> no

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:30.710 
jet the thea mister change like that no

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:33.190 
jet the thea mister change like that no
it's<00:00:30.980> very<00:00:31.340> straightforward<00:00:31.730> to<00:00:32.149> do<00:00:32.419> this<00:00:33.079> is

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:33.200 
it's very straightforward to do this is

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.310 
it's very straightforward to do this is
actually<00:00:33.530> one<00:00:33.770> image<00:00:34.130> and<00:00:35.090> if<00:00:35.870> i<00:00:36.020> show<00:00:36.260> you

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:36.320 
actually one image and if i show you

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.350 
actually one image and if i show you
it's<00:00:37.040> actually<00:00:37.340> made<00:00:37.520> up<00:00:37.670> of<00:00:37.790> an<00:00:37.940> image<00:00:38.180> like

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:38.360 
it's actually made up of an image like

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.200 
it's actually made up of an image like
this<00:00:38.980> which<00:00:39.980> is<00:00:40.130> the<00:00:40.280> two<00:00:40.460> images<00:00:40.730> side<00:00:41.180> by

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:41.210 
this which is the two images side by

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:43.030 
this which is the two images side by
side<00:00:41.690> you<00:00:41.990> see<00:00:42.140> you've<00:00:42.260> got<00:00:42.410> the<00:00:42.530> image<00:00:42.770> on<00:00:42.920> the

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:43.040 
side you see you've got the image on the

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.670 
side you see you've got the image on the
left<00:00:43.250> which<00:00:43.970> is<00:00:44.000> the<00:00:44.240> image<00:00:44.390> that<00:00:44.780> is<00:00:45.320> shown

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:45.680 
left which is the image that is shown

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:48.400 
left which is the image that is shown
before<00:00:46.160> the<00:00:46.520> mouse<00:00:46.670> hovers<00:00:47.480> over<00:00:47.870> and<00:00:48.230> when

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:48.410 
before the mouse hovers over and when

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:51.160 
before the mouse hovers over and when
the<00:00:48.500> house<00:00:48.650> the<00:00:49.400> mouse<00:00:49.610> hovers<00:00:50.270> over<00:00:50.690> the

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:51.170 
the house the mouse hovers over the

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.070 
the house the mouse hovers over the
right-hand<00:00:51.710> image<00:00:52.070> is<00:00:52.370> then<00:00:52.640> shown<00:00:53.080> and

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:54.080 
right-hand image is then shown and

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:55.210 
right-hand image is then shown and
there's<00:00:54.200> a<00:00:54.230> little<00:00:54.350> bit<00:00:54.530> of<00:00:54.710> cold<00:00:54.890> that<00:00:55.190> you

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:55.220 
there's a little bit of cold that you

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:57.940 
there's a little bit of cold that you
need<00:00:55.520> to<00:00:56.030> to<00:00:56.330> make<00:00:56.510> that<00:00:56.660> happen<00:00:56.870> but<00:00:57.590> it's

00:00:57.940 --> 00:00:57.950 
need to to make that happen but it's

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:00.100 
need to to make that happen but it's
very<00:00:58.070> straightforward<00:00:58.460> so<00:00:59.000> start<00:00:59.660> you<00:00:59.840> start

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:00.110 
very straightforward so start you start

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:03.280 
very straightforward so start you start
off<00:01:00.350> obviously<00:01:01.010> with<00:01:01.370> the<00:01:02.360> left<00:01:02.600> and<00:01:03.050> the

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:03.290 
off obviously with the left and the

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:05.740 
off obviously with the left and the
right<00:01:03.500> image<00:01:03.739> they<00:01:04.519> both<00:01:04.699> have<00:01:04.939> to<00:01:05.059> be<00:01:05.089> exactly

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:05.750 
right image they both have to be exactly

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.819 
right image they both have to be exactly
the<00:01:05.900> same<00:01:05.930> size<00:01:06.350> so<00:01:07.240> and<00:01:08.409> and<00:01:09.409> what<00:01:09.590> you<00:01:09.679> do

00:01:09.819 --> 00:01:09.829 
the same size so and and what you do

00:01:09.829 --> 00:01:11.950 
the same size so and and what you do
then<00:01:10.039> is<00:01:10.069> you<00:01:10.249> put<00:01:10.880> them<00:01:11.030> together<00:01:11.149> on<00:01:11.719> a

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960 
then is you put them together on a

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.230 
then is you put them together on a
single<00:01:12.409> image<00:01:12.530> with<00:01:13.369> a<00:01:13.399> space<00:01:13.759> down<00:01:14.090> in<00:01:14.179> the

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:14.240 
single image with a space down in the

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.770 
single image with a space down in the
middle<00:01:14.569> something<00:01:14.990> like<00:01:15.140> 10<00:01:16.780> that's

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780 
middle something like 10 that's

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.349 
middle something like 10 that's
approximately<00:01:18.049> what<00:01:18.439> i've<00:01:18.560> done<00:01:18.770> i've<00:01:18.979> got<00:01:19.359> so

00:01:20.349 --> 00:01:20.359 
approximately what i've done i've got so

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:22.090 
approximately what i've done i've got so
that<00:01:20.509> they're<00:01:20.689> not<00:01:20.749> overlapping<00:01:21.319> and<00:01:21.649> there's

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
that they're not overlapping and there's

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.739 
that they're not overlapping and there's
a<00:01:22.159> distinct<00:01:22.639> difference<00:01:22.819> between<00:01:23.090> the<00:01:23.539> two<00:01:23.719> of

00:01:23.739 --> 00:01:23.749 
a distinct difference between the two of

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:25.419 
a distinct difference between the two of
them<00:01:24.020> you<00:01:24.499> could<00:01:24.649> probably<00:01:24.770> get<00:01:25.009> away<00:01:25.130> of<00:01:25.340> a

00:01:25.419 --> 00:01:25.429 
them you could probably get away of a

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:26.950 
them you could probably get away of a
smaller<00:01:25.700> gap<00:01:25.969> than<00:01:26.119> that<00:01:26.299> but<00:01:26.479> I<00:01:26.509> usually

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:26.960 
smaller gap than that but I usually

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.770 
smaller gap than that but I usually
always<00:01:27.319> work<00:01:27.469> with<00:01:27.560> ten<00:01:27.859> so<00:01:28.460> if<00:01:29.030> we<00:01:29.270> if<00:01:29.479> we<00:01:29.509> now

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:29.780 
always work with ten so if we if we now

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:36.059 
always work with ten so if we if we now
create<00:01:31.359> if<00:01:32.359> I<00:01:32.509> now<00:01:32.719> create<00:01:33.109> another<00:01:33.880> image<00:01:34.880> now

00:01:36.059 --> 00:01:36.069 
create if I now create another image now

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:38.550 
create if I now create another image now
it's<00:01:37.069> a<00:01:37.130> very<00:01:37.159> straightforward<00:01:37.909> process

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:38.560 
it's a very straightforward process

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:44.260 
it's a very straightforward process
you're<00:01:39.560> going<00:01:39.590> to<00:01:39.859> be<00:01:39.950> doing<00:01:41.259> its<00:01:42.259> 580<00:01:43.149> and<00:01:44.149> I

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
you're going to be doing its 580 and I

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.239 
you're going to be doing its 580 and I
think<00:01:44.479> the<00:01:44.569> height<00:01:44.749> on<00:01:45.020> this<00:01:45.139> was<00:01:45.350> five<00:01:45.829> four

00:01:46.239 --> 00:01:46.249 
think the height on this was five four

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:52.510 
think the height on this was five four
three<00:01:46.280> so<00:01:48.069> just<00:01:49.069> create<00:01:49.340> a<00:01:49.369> new<00:01:51.249> new<00:01:52.249> image

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:52.520 
three so just create a new new image

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.690 
three so just create a new new image
like<00:01:52.789> that<00:01:53.499> and<00:01:54.499> then<00:01:55.009> really<00:01:55.279> it's<00:01:55.429> just<00:01:55.459> a

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
like that and then really it's just a

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.550 
like that and then really it's just a
question<00:01:55.909> of<00:01:56.319> positioning<00:01:57.319> the<00:01:59.289> it's<00:02:00.289> just<00:02:00.469> a

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:00.560 
question of positioning the it's just a

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:03.989 
question of positioning the it's just a
question<00:02:00.709> of<00:02:01.009> them<00:02:01.159> positioning<00:02:01.909> the<00:02:02.539> images

00:02:03.989 --> 00:02:03.999 
question of them positioning the images

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:08.980 
question of them positioning the images
to<00:02:04.999> the<00:02:05.119> left<00:02:05.359> and<00:02:05.659> the<00:02:06.229> right<00:02:07.780> once<00:02:08.780> you've

00:02:08.980 --> 00:02:08.990 
to the left and the right once you've

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:10.870 
to the left and the right once you've
created<00:02:09.259> the<00:02:09.649> larger<00:02:10.160> oops

00:02:10.870 --> 00:02:10.880 
created the larger oops

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.970 
created the larger oops
the<00:02:11.180> larger<00:02:11.569> sized<00:02:11.810> images<00:02:12.260> I'll<00:02:12.709> go<00:02:12.860> and

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
the larger sized images I'll go and

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:16.309 
the larger sized images I'll go and
duplicate<00:02:13.490> that<00:02:13.930> send<00:02:14.930> it<00:02:15.050> to

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
duplicate that send it to

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:20.390 
duplicate that send it to
a<00:02:16.379> new<00:02:16.980> image<00:02:17.569> so<00:02:18.569> he<00:02:18.719> aware<00:02:18.870> of<00:02:18.959> it<00:02:19.109> so<00:02:19.680> we've

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.400 
a new image so he aware of it so we've

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:21.979 
a new image so he aware of it so we've
got<00:02:20.549> the<00:02:20.639> left<00:02:20.790> image<00:02:21.060> and<00:02:21.450> the<00:02:21.540> right<00:02:21.569> image

00:02:21.979 --> 00:02:21.989 
got the left image and the right image

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:24.679 
got the left image and the right image
this<00:02:22.680> one's<00:02:22.920> the<00:02:23.069> right<00:02:23.579> image<00:02:24.030> so<00:02:24.540> we're<00:02:24.659> just

00:02:24.679 --> 00:02:24.689 
this one's the right image so we're just

00:02:24.689 --> 00:02:26.170 
this one's the right image so we're just
going<00:02:24.900> to<00:02:24.989> slide<00:02:25.319> that<00:02:25.469> over<00:02:25.530> to<00:02:25.920> the<00:02:26.010> right

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180 
going to slide that over to the right

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:33.289 
going to slide that over to the right
like<00:02:27.180> that<00:02:31.280> until<00:02:32.280> it's<00:02:32.459> perfectly<00:02:32.849> lined<00:02:33.120> up

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:33.299 
like that until it's perfectly lined up

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:36.020 
like that until it's perfectly lined up
there<00:02:34.019> we<00:02:34.170> are<00:02:34.260> and<00:02:34.560> then<00:02:35.370> the<00:02:35.459> left<00:02:35.670> image

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
there we are and then the left image

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.089 
there we are and then the left image
whoops<00:02:37.670> forgot<00:02:38.670> to<00:02:38.879> select<00:02:39.060> the<00:02:39.209> layer<00:02:39.389> and

00:02:40.089 --> 00:02:40.099 
whoops forgot to select the layer and

00:02:40.099 --> 00:02:47.199 
whoops forgot to select the layer and
then<00:02:41.099> this<00:02:41.280> one<00:02:43.189> will<00:02:44.189> just<00:02:44.219> go<00:02:44.400> into<00:02:44.459> position

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.209 

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:50.059 

to<00:02:48.209> the<00:02:48.299> right<00:02:48.349> so<00:02:49.349> it's<00:02:49.379> four<00:02:49.650> left

00:02:50.059 --> 00:02:50.069 
to the right so it's four left

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:54.110 
to the right so it's four left
so<00:02:50.700> you'd<00:02:51.389> then<00:02:51.569> save<00:02:51.900> that<00:02:51.930> I<00:02:52.849> save<00:02:53.849> it<00:02:54.000> as<00:02:54.090> a

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
so you'd then save that I save it as a

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:59.000 
so you'd then save that I save it as a
PNG<00:02:54.480> and<00:02:56.510> you<00:02:57.510> so<00:02:58.199> that's<00:02:58.379> that's<00:02:58.680> fairly

00:02:59.000 --> 00:02:59.010 
PNG and you so that's that's fairly

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.309 
PNG and you so that's that's fairly
straightforward<00:02:59.299> the<00:03:00.299> next<00:03:00.629> the<00:03:00.870> next<00:03:01.169> thing

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:01.319 
straightforward the next the next thing

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:04.059 
straightforward the next the next thing
that<00:03:01.469> you'll<00:03:01.590> need<00:03:01.739> to<00:03:01.799> do<00:03:02.099> is<00:03:02.609> to<00:03:02.909> go<00:03:03.060> into

00:03:04.059 --> 00:03:04.069 
that you'll need to do is to go into

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:08.869 
that you'll need to do is to go into
into<00:03:05.299> WordPress<00:03:06.299> and<00:03:06.569> go<00:03:07.409> into<00:03:07.560> media<00:03:08.099> and<00:03:08.340> add

00:04:53.570 --> 00:04:53.580 
effectively good actually happens here

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:56.360 
effectively good actually happens here
is<00:04:53.940> that<00:04:54.120> as<00:04:54.360> you<00:04:54.810> hover<00:04:55.020> the<00:04:55.290> mouse<00:04:55.320> over<00:04:55.800> the

is that as you hover the mouse over the

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:58.940 
is that as you hover the mouse over the
image<00:04:56.760> it<00:04:57.300> goes<00:04:57.540> from<00:04:57.780> showing<00:04:58.230> the<00:04:58.440> left-hand

00:04:58.940 --> 00:04:58.950 
image it goes from showing the left-hand

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:00.950 
image it goes from showing the left-hand
side<00:04:59.190> of<00:04:59.220> the<00:04:59.550> image<00:04:59.820> to<00:05:00.150> the<00:05:00.240> right<00:05:00.270> hand<00:05:00.720> side

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:00.960 
side of the image to the right hand side

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.560 
side of the image to the right hand side
of<00:05:01.170> the<00:05:01.260> image<00:05:01.410> so<00:05:02.100> it's<00:05:02.250> anytime<00:05:02.700> you're<00:05:03.420> only

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:03.570 
of the image so it's anytime you're only

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:06.260 
of the image so it's anytime you're only
going<00:05:03.840> to<00:05:03.960> see<00:05:04.320> the<00:05:05.130> width<00:05:05.400> of<00:05:05.580> the<00:05:05.730> image<00:05:05.910> no

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:06.270 
going to see the width of the image no

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:08.600 
going to see the width of the image no
the<00:05:06.630> two<00:05:06.840> images<00:05:07.020> that<00:05:07.260> I'm<00:05:07.620> using<00:05:07.920> they're<00:05:08.310> on

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:08.610 
the two images that I'm using they're on

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:12.080 
the two images that I'm using they're on
the<00:05:09.150> single<00:05:09.510> image<00:05:09.630> of<00:05:09.900> each<00:05:10.280> 285<00:05:11.280> Y<00:05:11.640> so<00:05:12.000> the

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:12.090 
the single image of each 285 Y so the

00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:14.030 
the single image of each 285 Y so the
left-hand<00:05:12.390> image<00:05:12.630> is<00:05:12.900> 285<00:05:13.440> and<00:05:13.890> the

00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:14.040 
left-hand image is 285 and the

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.700 
left-hand image is 285 and the
right-hand<00:05:14.520> image<00:05:14.910> is<00:05:15.120> 285<00:05:15.780> and<00:05:16.050> then<00:05:16.590> you've

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:16.710 
right-hand image is 285 and then you've

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:19.520 
right-hand image is 285 and then you've
got<00:05:16.860> the<00:05:17.250> obviously<00:05:17.640> the<00:05:17.730> height<00:05:17.910> is<00:05:18.120> 5<00:05:18.330> 4<00:05:18.630> 3<00:05:18.870> so

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:19.530 
got the obviously the height is 5 4 3 so

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:22.159 
got the obviously the height is 5 4 3 so
these<00:05:19.890> settings<00:05:20.400> here<00:05:20.700> need<00:05:21.330> to<00:05:21.540> be<00:05:21.720> the<00:05:21.930> size

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:22.169 
these settings here need to be the size

00:05:22.169 --> 00:05:26.060 
these settings here need to be the size
of<00:05:22.560> the<00:05:23.550> image<00:05:23.820> that<00:05:23.850> you<00:05:24.030> want<00:05:24.330> to<00:05:24.540> display<00:05:25.070> so

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:26.070 
of the image that you want to display so

00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:27.890 
of the image that you want to display so
then<00:05:26.760> what<00:05:26.940> you're<00:05:27.030> going<00:05:27.180> to<00:05:27.270> do<00:05:27.450> is<00:05:27.600> this

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:27.900 
then what you're going to do is this

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:29.690 
then what you're going to do is this
background<00:05:28.169> setting<00:05:28.710> here<00:05:29.190> is<00:05:29.400> where<00:05:29.580> you

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:29.700 
background setting here is where you

00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:33.080 
background setting here is where you
actually<00:05:29.970> put<00:05:30.150> the<00:05:30.180> URL<00:05:30.510> of<00:05:31.400> the<00:05:32.400> image<00:05:32.430> that

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:33.090

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:34.810 
actually put the URL of the image that
you've<00:05:33.210> uploaded<00:05:33.360> which<00:05:34.080> is<00:05:34.230> the<00:05:34.350> big<00:05:34.530> image

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:45.060 
is I've put some extra code on here for

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:47.120 
is I've put some extra code on here for
clicking<00:05:45.450> it<00:05:45.600> so<00:05:46.140> when<00:05:46.320> you<00:05:46.410> click<00:05:46.680> the<00:05:46.830> image

00:05:53.090 --> 00:05:53.100 
to another page so what I'll do is I'll

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:56.090 
to another page so what I'll do is I'll
put<00:05:53.130> all<00:05:53.490> of<00:05:53.520> that<00:05:53.730> on<00:05:54.030> on<00:05:54.750> my<00:05:55.230> website<00:05:55.680> so<00:05:56.040> you

00:05:56.090 --> 00:05:56.100 
put all of that on on my website so you

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:58.100 
put all of that on on my website so you
can<00:05:56.190> just<00:05:56.430> easily<00:05:56.640> copy<00:05:57.090> and<00:05:57.210> paste<00:05:57.600> it<00:05:57.870> rather

00:05:58.100 --> 00:05:58.110 
can just easily copy and paste it rather

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:00.080 
can just easily copy and paste it rather
than<00:05:58.350> trying<00:05:58.560> to<00:05:58.650> copy<00:05:59.400> it<00:05:59.580> off<00:05:59.669> this<00:05:59.850> video

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:00.090 
than trying to copy it off this video

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:02.000 
than trying to copy it off this video
because<00:06:00.720> it's<00:06:00.960> obviously<00:06:01.500> going<00:06:01.620> to<00:06:01.680> be<00:06:01.740> prone

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:02.010 
because it's obviously going to be prone

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:05.720 
because it's obviously going to be prone
to<00:06:02.250> mistakes<00:06:02.400> and<00:06:04.250> once<00:06:05.250> you've<00:06:05.460> done<00:06:05.669> that

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:05.730 
to mistakes and once you've done that

00:06:05.730 --> 00:06:11.000 
to mistakes and once you've done that
and<00:06:06.360> you<00:06:06.660> save<00:06:06.900> it<00:06:08.540> then<00:06:09.590> you<00:06:10.590> should<00:06:10.740> get<00:06:10.919> an

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:11.010 
and you save it then you should get an

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:13.040 
and you save it then you should get an
image<00:06:11.190> like<00:06:11.310> this<00:06:11.930> which<00:06:12.930> is<00:06:12.990> really

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:13.050 
image like this which is really

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:16.310 
image like this which is really
effective<00:06:13.770> and<00:06:14.550> it's<00:06:14.730> really<00:06:14.880> simple<00:06:15.320> there's

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:16.320 
effective and it's really simple there's

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:18.860 
effective and it's really simple there's
no<00:06:16.500> there's<00:06:17.280> nothing<00:06:17.580> fancy<00:06:17.880> about<00:06:18.120> it<00:06:18.540> at<00:06:18.720> all

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:18.870 
no there's nothing fancy about it at all

00:06:18.870 --> 00:06:20.390 
no there's nothing fancy about it at all
and<00:06:18.930> there<00:06:19.440> are<00:06:19.560> a<00:06:19.590> number<00:06:19.740> of<00:06:19.980> people<00:06:20.160> out

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:20.400 
and there are a number of people out

00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:22.820 
and there are a number of people out
there<00:06:20.430> as<00:06:20.700> I<00:06:20.730> said<00:06:20.970> earlier<00:06:21.300> who<00:06:21.840> are<00:06:22.110> making

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:22.830 
there as I said earlier who are making

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:24.740 
there as I said earlier who are making
this<00:06:22.890> incredibly<00:06:23.400> complicated<00:06:23.820> when<00:06:24.630> it

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:24.750 
this incredibly complicated when it

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:26.250 
this incredibly complicated when it
isn't

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:26.260 
isn't

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:29.190 
isn't
that<00:06:27.130> that<00:06:27.700> is<00:06:27.880> how<00:06:28.000> you<00:06:28.060> make<00:06:28.510> an<00:06:28.690> image<00:06:28.930> that

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:29.200 
that that is how you make an image that
