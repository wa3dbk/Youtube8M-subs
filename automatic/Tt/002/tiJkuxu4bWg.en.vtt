00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.370
 U-turn and a guitarist point 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.380
 Hello everyone, let's go straight to 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:32.260
 parsing a song begins with a chord m 

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:34.200
 let's first put a chord 6 not 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:37.480
 sounds me we are open 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:39.120
 4 from laziness on the second fret the second string 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.710
 On the first hellish one, the first string is open 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.650
 throughout the song we will have 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:48.070
 such a rhythmic pattern is such 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:50.540
 pinch pinch is played he 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:57.800
 so bass 

00:00:50.540 --> 00:01:00.320
 3 2 1 play two times together and bass y 

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:04.280
 we will alternate that is for each 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:08.930
 chord will let's say we start 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:09.910
 We play pian and pull two tweaks for yes 

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:13.729
 I'm two tweaks 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:16.750
 4 2 mistake in the entry will play two 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:16.750
 quart times m 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:23.270
 Now starting the songs also starts with 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.560
 and where are they why we continue next 

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.560
 again they are playing the card 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:35.800
 then comes the chord d em put so 4 

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:41.220
 open 3 on the second 2 on the third 1 on 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:42.369
 the first fret is playing 4 2 mistake and she 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.330
 filling 

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:45.330
 connect 

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:52.440
 next comes the card he is put 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:56.220
 almost what they all fingers 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:02:00.150
 raise on the string above 6 two tweaks 5 2 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:07.220
 hours and then play the chord again and in 

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:11.120
 After we get it ie 

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:15.890
 and m again the next line begins 

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:18.590
 We play again MDM 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:23.660
 Further there is a Kuldja put it 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:26.330
 so 6 on the third fret 5 on the second 4 3 

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:27.050
 will be open and the first 2 will be on 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.880
