00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
out-of-focus reading and the center is

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.240 
out-of-focus reading and the center is
in<00:01:20.549> focus<00:01:21.090> so<00:01:22.080> it's<00:01:22.229> very<00:01:22.380> nice<00:01:22.650> it<00:01:22.830> looks<00:01:23.040> like

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
image perspective in a way and we've

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:34.550 
image perspective in a way and we've
also<00:01:28.590> got<00:01:28.950> here<00:01:29.490> and<00:01:29.790> dots<00:01:31.549> that<00:01:32.549> you<00:01:33.560> very

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
also got here and dots that you very

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.590 
also got here and dots that you very
weird<00:01:34.950> on<00:01:35.549> by<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:35.880> way<00:01:36.000> on<00:01:36.090> that<00:01:36.180> depth<00:01:36.420> of

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
weird on by the way on that depth of

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:39.109 
weird on by the way on that depth of
field<00:01:36.900> you<00:01:37.530> can<00:01:37.710> just<00:01:38.040> the<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:38.759> depth<00:01:38.970> of

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
field you can just the the depth of

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.450 
field you can just the the depth of
field<00:01:39.439> as<00:01:40.439> you<00:01:41.250> actually<00:01:41.820> see<00:01:42.060> here<00:01:42.299> you<00:01:42.450> can

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
field as you actually see here you can

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.120 
field as you actually see here you can
move<00:01:44.460> the<00:01:45.079> depth<00:01:46.079> of<00:01:46.200> field<00:01:46.409> around<00:01:46.590> so<00:01:46.920> if<00:01:47.040> you

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
move the depth of field around so if you

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:50.179 
move the depth of field around so if you
want<00:01:47.340> to<00:01:47.490> have<00:01:47.670> just<00:01:47.939> the<00:01:48.060> speaker<00:01:48.649> in<00:01:49.649> focus

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
want to have just the speaker in focus

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:51.950 
want to have just the speaker in focus
but<00:01:50.220> everything<00:01:50.700> else<00:01:50.820> to<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.090> right<00:01:51.270> out<00:01:51.899> of

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 
but everything else to the right out of

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.429 
but everything else to the right out of
focus<00:01:53.540> take<00:01:54.540> it<00:01:54.689> like<00:01:54.720> that<00:01:54.869> and<00:01:55.110> then<00:01:55.320> the

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
focus take it like that and then the

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.209 
focus take it like that and then the
photo<00:01:55.680> will<00:01:55.950> look<00:01:56.130> like<00:01:56.689> yes<00:01:57.689> that<00:01:58.259> cameras<00:01:58.950> I

something<00:04:33.409> really<00:04:33.800> close<00:04:34.009> up<00:04:34.219> like<00:04:34.430> this

00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:34.900 
something really close up like this

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.830 
something really close up like this
speaker<00:04:35.900> grill<00:04:36.610> and<00:04:37.610> then<00:04:38.300> something<00:04:38.569> far

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:38.840 
speaker grill and then something far

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:43.089 
speaker grill and then something far
away<00:04:40.569> yep<00:04:41.569> that<00:04:41.779> focus<00:04:42.139> is<00:04:42.259> fine<00:04:42.499> very<00:04:42.830> quick

00:04:43.089 --> 00:04:43.099 
away yep that focus is fine very quick

00:04:43.099 --> 00:04:50.409 
away yep that focus is fine very quick
indeed<00:04:44.710> ok<00:04:45.710> now<00:04:46.490> let's<00:04:46.520> play<00:04:46.879> that<00:04:47.090> back<00:04:49.419> and

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:50.419 
indeed ok now let's play that back and

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:59.080 
indeed ok now let's play that back and
we'll<00:04:50.599> see<00:04:50.870> what<00:04:51.680> that<00:04:51.830> looks<00:04:51.889> like<00:04:57.879> now<00:04:58.879> this

00:04:59.080 --> 00:04:59.090 
we'll see what that looks like now this

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:00.700 
we'll see what that looks like now this
is<00:04:59.150> going<00:04:59.479> to<00:04:59.539> be<00:04:59.689> the<00:04:59.810> most<00:04:59.960> boring<00:05:00.289> video

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:00.710 
is going to be the most boring video

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:03.159 
is going to be the most boring video
you've<00:05:01.099> ever<00:05:01.279> seen<00:05:01.689> but<00:05:02.689> you<00:05:02.779> can<00:05:02.930> see

00:05:03.159 --> 00:05:03.169 
you've ever seen but you can see

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:05.200 
you've ever seen but you can see
basically<00:05:03.439> it<00:05:03.860> records<00:05:04.340> it<00:05:04.460> twice<00:05:04.729> as<00:05:04.969> speed

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:05.210 
basically it records it twice as speed

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:06.909 
basically it records it twice as speed
by<00:05:05.389> the<00:05:05.449> looks<00:05:05.689> of<00:05:05.810> it<00:05:05.900> or<00:05:06.139> faster<00:05:06.650> than<00:05:06.770> it

00:05:06.909 --> 00:05:06.919 
by the looks of it or faster than it

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:08.709 
by the looks of it or faster than it
normally<00:05:07.039> would<00:05:07.279> so<00:05:08.090> everything<00:05:08.569> you've

00:05:08.709 --> 00:05:08.719 
normally would so everything you've

00:05:08.719 --> 00:05:12.070 
normally would so everything you've
filmed<00:05:09.069> gets<00:05:10.069> a<00:05:10.189> lot<00:05:10.340> slower<00:05:10.580> so<00:05:11.539> I'm<00:05:11.779> getting

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:12.080 
filmed gets a lot slower so I'm getting

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.529 
filmed gets a lot slower so I'm getting
if<00:05:12.379> you<00:05:12.529> may<00:05:12.710> be<00:05:12.770> filming<00:05:13.669> some<00:05:14.330> of<00:05:14.419> those

00:05:14.529 --> 00:05:14.539 
if you may be filming some of those

00:05:14.539 --> 00:05:17.110 
if you may be filming some of those
personal<00:05:15.349> videos<00:05:15.710> that<00:05:16.069> Tulisa<00:05:16.520> tends<00:05:16.939> to

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:17.120 
personal videos that Tulisa tends to

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:20.439 
personal videos that Tulisa tends to
fill<00:05:17.379> you<00:05:18.379> could<00:05:18.529> maybe<00:05:18.879> record<00:05:19.879> it<00:05:19.969> twice<00:05:20.270> the

00:05:20.439 --> 00:05:20.449 
fill you could maybe record it twice the

00:05:20.449 --> 00:05:23.379 
fill you could maybe record it twice the
speed<00:05:20.659> and<00:05:20.839> playback<00:05:21.379> a<00:05:21.439> lot<00:05:21.770> slower<00:05:22.389> makes

00:05:23.379 --> 00:05:23.389 
speed and playback a lot slower makes

00:05:23.389 --> 00:05:25.450 
speed and playback a lot slower makes
everything<00:05:23.779> seem<00:05:24.229> like<00:05:24.560> it<00:05:24.770> lasted<00:05:25.219> a<00:05:25.310> little

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:25.460 
everything seem like it lasted a little

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:29.529 
everything seem like it lasted a little
bit<00:05:25.729> longer<00:05:25.999> than<00:05:26.240> it<00:05:26.360> actually<00:05:26.539> did<00:05:27.080> and<00:05:28.539> pick

00:05:29.529 --> 00:05:29.539 
bit longer than it actually did and pick

00:05:29.539 --> 00:05:31.059 
bit longer than it actually did and pick
that<00:05:29.569> you<00:05:30.110> can<00:05:30.259> see<00:05:30.439> the<00:05:30.560> speaker<00:05:30.860> grill

00:05:31.059 --> 00:05:31.069 
that you can see the speaker grill

00:05:31.069 --> 00:05:33.040 
that you can see the speaker grill
they're<00:05:31.279> real<00:05:31.669> sharp<00:05:32.150> focus<00:05:32.419> look<00:05:32.870> at<00:05:32.960> that

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:33.050 
they're real sharp focus look at that

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:34.899 
they're real sharp focus look at that
you<00:05:33.139> can<00:05:33.199> see<00:05:33.289> all<00:05:33.500> the<00:05:33.529> little<00:05:33.680> grill<00:05:34.099> parts

00:05:34.899 --> 00:05:34.909

you can see all the little grill parts
there<00:05:35.360> and<00:05:36.169> then<00:05:36.409> goes<00:05:37.039> out<00:05:37.250> focus<00:05:37.729> slightly

00:05:38.079 --> 00:05:38.089 
there and then goes out focus slightly

00:05:38.089 --> 00:05:42.610 
there and then goes out focus slightly
there<00:05:38.240> unfortunately<00:05:38.479> but<00:05:38.949> it<00:05:39.949> moves<00:05:40.339> up<00:05:41.620> and

00:05:42.610 --> 00:05:42.620
