 lorenzo and stoner. valentino rossi is what the two allies with big boots 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.390
 his clan 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:27.560
 the attack of the pilot of the yamaha marco simoncelli on the occasion of the jambs 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:29.060
 Friday commition 

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.970
 almost never visited in the past by the chin 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.590
 made installer + with a stance against burns 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:39.920
 accused of directly managing it specific blend your liking with 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.310
 the stylist's meat support 

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:47.140
 right meaning the valentino answer you mean for chainsaws 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.650
 lem 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:54.400
 guesses olè olè olè voices that say that practically this heard 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.580
 mission 

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:58.460
 an Italian stain 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:00:59.840
 I heard these words 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.800
 where we assist comicsworld we do what we do verb fasano change 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:09.820
 the rules for how you are interested or we find the advantages of 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:15.320
 week I am you usually drink lately we will understand 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.310
 simoncelli since the doors of the Ardennes then last year in history 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:22.800
 normal if it doesn't come then lorenzo came last year on Monday 1 time but 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.900
 now it comes more often than not if someone else 

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:29.360
 however, it is a very thin accusation because in the meantime it does not 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.939
 this blessed has never been the city comic we do a job too 

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:36.970
 also for other pilots 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:40.900
 and above all, theory begins again, we talk about safety on the slopes 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.540
 because the city commission was born in 2003 after the death of paper on pucca 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.190
 is 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:49.270
 earth 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.480
 for pilots to have the item specification 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:53.810
 we don't have it here 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:58.470
 here we have to do this job here we don't go if someone moves we have 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:02.310
 done a job during these years in my opinion it is very important for you 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.300
 also for the rents rents 

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.650
 and I think I felt 100 euros 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:11.689
 mqc great-grandfather advantage but a privilege for internet pilots 

00:02:11.689 --> 00:02:15.829
 in the other types follow me the pilots don't shit anyone and make them go where 

00:02:15.829 --> 00:02:16.199
 I want 

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:21.149
 them and if by any chance the use of there is something they say you felt 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:25.609
 this is a pretty smart thing for the woman in 

00:02:25.609 --> 00:02:29.330
 effects justify commition is a privilege of motorcycling 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:33.129
 while those who go to me are blamed for the race direction 

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:37.290
 which often seems to sleep in front of the monitor and when it does it does it in 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.900
 wrong way we didn't see very well Sunday morning when it was.just 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:47.439
 keystone with a fine of 5000 euros fine deserved indeed arises 

00:02:47.439 --> 00:02:51.959
 someone must be won the Milan I trust in you because of punching with the 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:54.569
 gastone by no means a very bad gesture 

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:58.319
 showing also its character limit 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:02.739
 but also the fumes maneuver had to be scanned in some way even with a 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:06.419
 simple reminder because very dangerous to put insane history 

00:03:06.419 --> 00:03:10.189
 low speed another is coming at full throttle 

00:03:10.189 --> 00:03:15.279
 pilot I also have itunes unfezant simoncelli puzzles overtaking 

00:03:15.279 --> 00:03:20.629
 of mars undoubtedly wrong status and punishment so wrong but we are 

00:03:20.629 --> 00:03:24.869
 sure that it would be the same way if it had never been seen 

00:03:24.869 --> 00:03:25.529
 the episode
