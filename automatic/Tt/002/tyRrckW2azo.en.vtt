do I'm going to take some glass beads

00:00:31.899 --> 00:00:35.970 
do I'm going to take some glass beads
and<00:00:32.730> I'm<00:00:33.730> first<00:00:34.000> going<00:00:34.149> to<00:00:34.210> put<00:00:34.390> them<00:00:34.480> on<00:00:34.980> with

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:35.980 
and I'm first going to put them on with

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.030 
and I'm first going to put them on with
a<00:00:36.010> drop<00:00:36.340> just<00:00:36.940> kind<00:00:37.180> of<00:00:37.270> haphazardly<00:00:38.080> here<00:00:38.890> and

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:39.040 
a drop just kind of haphazardly here and

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:44.370 
a drop just kind of haphazardly here and
there<00:00:42.480> don't<00:00:43.480> particularly<00:00:43.810> care<00:00:43.990> for<00:00:44.170> the

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:44.380 
there don't particularly care for the

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:46.260 
there don't particularly care for the
sound<00:00:44.650> that<00:00:44.860> the<00:00:45.010> glass<00:00:45.190> beads<00:00:45.550> bang<00:00:45.940> up

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:46.270 
sound that the glass beads bang up

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:49.080 
sound that the glass beads bang up
against<00:00:46.840> the<00:00:46.870> surface<00:00:47.200> so<00:00:48.160> we<00:00:48.310> found<00:00:48.579> a

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:49.090 
against the surface so we found a

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:51.720 
against the surface so we found a
different<00:00:49.540> way<00:00:50.010> making<00:00:51.010> them<00:00:51.250> be<00:00:51.430> what<00:00:51.579> we

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:51.730 
different way making them be what we

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:53.640 
different way making them be what we
want<00:00:51.970> to<00:00:52.300> be<00:00:52.480> we're<00:00:52.810> going<00:00:52.930> to<00:00:52.989> use<00:00:53.140> this<00:00:53.320> tool

thick as you want or as thin as you want
the<00:01:35.740> thicker<00:01:36.009> you<00:01:36.249> make<00:01:36.490> them<00:01:36.819> when<00:01:37.450> they<00:01:37.479> dry

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:37.990 
the thicker you make them when they dry

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.879 
the thicker you make them when they dry
they<00:01:38.529> don't<00:01:38.799> dry<00:01:39.130> crystal<00:01:39.639> clear<00:01:40.649> they<00:01:41.649> might

00:01:41.879 --> 00:01:41.889 
they don't dry crystal clear they might

00:01:41.889 --> 00:01:43.830 
they don't dry crystal clear they might
drive<00:01:42.159> the<00:01:42.369> little<00:01:42.549> whitish<00:01:43.060> gray<00:01:43.450> color

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:43.840 
drive the little whitish gray color

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.019 
drive the little whitish gray color
that's<00:01:44.499> why<00:01:44.709> we<00:01:44.889> run<00:01:45.100> a<00:01:45.130> glaze<00:01:45.429> over<00:01:45.609> the<00:01:45.759> top

00:01:46.019 --> 00:01:46.029 
that's why we run a glaze over the top

00:01:46.029 --> 00:01:50.129 
that's why we run a glaze over the top
of<00:01:46.060> them<00:01:46.799> just<00:01:47.799> so<00:01:47.950> that<00:01:48.099> we<00:01:48.219> can<00:01:48.459> get<00:01:49.139> that

00:01:50.129 --> 00:01:50.139 
of them just so that we can get that

00:01:50.139 --> 00:01:52.980 
of them just so that we can get that
white<00:01:50.380> is<00:01:50.529> that<00:01:50.829> white<00:01:51.310> kind<00:01:52.029> of<00:01:52.179> grayish

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990 
white is that white kind of grayish

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.230 
white is that white kind of grayish
color<00:01:53.020> to<00:01:53.649> disappear<00:01:54.219> but<00:01:54.789> when<00:01:54.939> you<00:01:55.029> put

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.240 
color to disappear but when you put

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.260 
color to disappear but when you put
these<00:01:55.389> in<00:01:55.569> the<00:01:55.689> light<00:01:55.959> they<00:01:56.950> just<00:01:57.279> glisten<00:01:57.729> it

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
these in the light they just glisten it

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:24.910 
from your surface and take a look to see

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:27.330 
from your surface and take a look to see
whether<00:06:25.390> or<00:06:25.510> not<00:06:25.720> exactly<00:06:26.590> the<00:06:26.770> way<00:06:26.890> you<00:06:26.950> want

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:27.340 
whether or not exactly the way you want

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:29.580 
whether or not exactly the way you want
then<00:06:27.940> you<00:06:28.090> can<00:06:28.270> always<00:06:28.420> come<00:06:28.690> back<00:06:28.840> and<00:06:28.900> add<00:06:29.260> or

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:29.590 
then you can always come back and add or

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:31.560 
then you can always come back and add or
take<00:06:29.860> more<00:06:30.070> off<00:06:30.280> as<00:06:30.550> I'm<00:06:31.000> looking<00:06:31.120> at<00:06:31.450> the

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:31.570 
take more off as I'm looking at the

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:33.720 
take more off as I'm looking at the
surface<00:06:31.990> once<00:06:32.200> I<00:06:32.320> step<00:06:33.010> back<00:06:33.220> and<00:06:33.430> looked<00:06:33.610> at

00:06:33.720 --> 00:06:33.730 
surface once I step back and looked at

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:35.490 
surface once I step back and looked at
the<00:06:33.820> surface<00:06:34.180> I<00:06:34.270> saw<00:06:34.450> that<00:06:34.570> it<00:06:34.690> was<00:06:34.780> a<00:06:34.810> little

00:06:35.490 --> 00:06:35.500 
the surface I saw that it was a little

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:37.860 
the surface I saw that it was a little
heavier<00:06:35.890> on<00:06:36.250> the<00:06:36.280> glaze<00:06:36.550> on<00:06:36.790> this<00:06:36.970> side<00:06:37.240> then<00:06:37.750> I

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:37.870 
heavier on the glaze on this side then I

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:40.110 
heavier on the glaze on this side then I
was<00:06:38.080> on<00:06:38.260> this<00:06:38.410> side<00:06:38.680> so<00:06:39.280> what<00:06:39.400> I'm<00:06:39.490> going<00:06:39.700> to<00:06:39.790> do

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:40.120 
was on this side so what I'm going to do

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:41.850 
was on this side so what I'm going to do
is<00:06:40.450> I'm<00:06:40.840> just<00:06:40.900> going<00:06:41.110> to<00:06:41.170> add<00:06:41.410> a<00:06:41.440> little<00:06:41.740> bit

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:41.860 
is I'm just going to add a little bit

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:58.110 
is I'm just going to add a little bit
more<00:06:41.950> glaze<00:06:42.370> over<00:06:42.670> here<00:06:43.330> and<00:06:44.340> even<00:06:45.340> it<00:06:45.580> out
