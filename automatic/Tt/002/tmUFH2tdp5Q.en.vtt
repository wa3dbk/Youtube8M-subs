00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:59.410 
will suffer some damage but you won't
die<00:03:54.620> so<00:03:55.620> I<00:03:55.920> think<00:03:56.329> the<00:03:57.329> death<00:03:57.989> traps<00:03:58.650> were

00:03:59.410 --> 00:03:59.420 
die so I think the death traps were

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:04.400 
die so I think the death traps were
where<00:04:00.420> other<00:04:00.959> were<00:04:01.920> just<00:04:01.980> the<00:04:03.230> whatever<00:04:04.230> it

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:04.410 
where other were just the whatever it

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:09.530 
where other were just the whatever it
was<00:04:05.239> darts<00:04:06.239> or<00:04:06.630> I<00:04:07.019> think<00:04:07.650> it<00:04:08.340> was<00:04:08.370> darts<00:04:08.940> and

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:09.540 
was darts or I think it was darts and

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:16.430 
was darts or I think it was darts and
not<00:04:09.750> not<00:04:10.230> this<00:04:10.440> deadly<00:04:11.340> edge<00:04:11.940> of<00:04:13.970> something<00:04:15.440> so

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440 
not not this deadly edge of something so

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.990 
not not this deadly edge of something so
I<00:04:16.799> didn't<00:04:17.609> accept<00:04:18.090> that<00:04:18.389> as<00:04:18.950> death<00:04:19.950> or<00:04:20.220> any

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
I didn't accept that as death or any

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.500 
I didn't accept that as death or any
mistake<00:04:21.570> playing<00:04:22.430> and<00:04:23.430> that's<00:04:23.820> why<00:04:24.030> I<00:04:24.090> play

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:24.510 
mistake playing and that's why I play
