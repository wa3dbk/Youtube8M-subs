00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:11.010
 Today I'll show you how to do it all the way 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:14.280
 little effort and only a few attacks 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.170
 a beautiful origami bookmark 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.270
 if you can do square 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.800
 you use origami paper but you can 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:22.259
 also like any other 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.630
 then use square sheet of paper 

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:25.880
 the colorful printed page is best 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.279
 downward 

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:34.110
 Now we hold the point from below 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:40.140
 right to the other tip so that one 

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:43.380
 triangle arises for this three hold 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:47.660
 you then right tip exactly 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:47.660
 up in the middle of the triangle him 

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:57.300
 we'll do the same after that too 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:01:01.940
 Left top we could 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.940
 right and center up 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:09.369
 now we will be the two pointed and 

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:09.369
 half fold down again 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:21.229
 then this woman is born 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:25.580
 Now we can do the circuits again 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:27.110
 solve and looks the whole way and 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.030
 Now we are the middle of the triangle 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:32.180
 from top to bottom, however, work 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:34.850
 just fold the front part in like 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:39.440
 children down to the middle is for 

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:41.390
 trend if we now the other two 

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:45.830
 Repeat steps again by her 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:47.660
 right side up field and then 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:50.149
 do not fold forward but in the 

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:52.970
 resulting bag inside pointed 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:56.509
 be folded down and relies on technology 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:59.119
 after that he comes in the book page 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:03.679
 same fold up the other side 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:13.209
 again and then resembled lace in the 

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:15.980
 arisen keep our already origami 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:19.070
 bookmark finished that you can now 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:21.530
 Use it on top of a book page 

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:24.170
 of course, it is very big now 

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:26.350
 that it is a 50 kw 

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.670
 I like to use a quarter of it 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:31.370
 that a very nice size 

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:34.250
 it can be used very nicely around it 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:36.320
 try to use as bookmarks Use 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.209
 But it's best to do it 

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.920
 has a lot of joy at the tinkering 

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:42.230
 next time i'll show you a little one 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.799
 variation of this bookmark the above 

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:47.049
 is open 

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:47.049
 joy and fun to the light
