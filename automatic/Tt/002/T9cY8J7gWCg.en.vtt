significant to do the words the bone
implementation<00:00:13.490> here<00:00:14.990> we<00:00:15.990> have<00:00:16.230> an

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:17.930 
implementation here we have an

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:22.029 
implementation here we have an
approximate<00:00:18.930> Road<00:00:19.289> map<00:00:19.590> where<00:00:20.580> you<00:00:21.000> can<00:00:21.180> see

some things already Don's some still
have<00:00:26.519> to<00:00:26.699> be<00:00:26.820> done<00:00:26.849> and<00:00:28.130> I'm<00:00:29.130> going<00:00:29.640> to

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
have to be done and I'm going to

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.610 
have to be done and I'm going to
demonstrate<00:00:31.640> the<00:00:32.640> idioms<00:00:33.120> one<00:00:33.480> by<00:00:33.660> one<00:00:33.899> first

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
demonstrate the idioms one by one first

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:50.690 
demonstrate the idioms one by one first
is<00:00:35.899> this<00:00:41.570> the<00:00:44.329> this<00:00:45.329> change<00:00:45.750> is<00:00:46.289> about<00:00:49.550> the<00:00:50.550> way

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
is this the this change is about the way

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:57.229 
is this the this change is about the way
how<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.719> groups<00:00:51.960> are<00:00:52.260> transform<00:00:52.920> it<00:00:55.670> for<00:00:56.670> a

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
how the groups are transform it for a

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:09.039 
how the groups are transform it for a
group<00:01:00.590> we<00:01:01.590> don't<00:01:02.190> have<00:01:02.609> a<00:01:03.120> zoom<00:01:04.280> or<00:01:07.790> position

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:09.049 
group we don't have a zoom or position

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:12.620 
group we don't have a zoom or position
parameters<00:01:10.049> anymore<00:01:10.890> we<00:01:11.490> just<00:01:11.520> have<00:01:12.060> a<00:01:12.330> single

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
parameters anymore we just have a single

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:18.160 
parameters anymore we just have a single
transformation<00:01:13.260> parameter<00:01:14.750> which<00:01:15.750> could<00:01:16.110> be

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:18.170 
transformation parameter which could be

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:21.410 
transformation parameter which could be
expanded<00:01:19.170> into<00:01:19.680> composite<00:01:20.100> and<00:01:20.400> here<00:01:21.000> we<00:01:21.180> have

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
expanded into composite and here we have

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:35.539 
expanded into composite and here we have
offset<00:01:24.229> we<00:01:25.229> have<00:01:25.530> angle<00:01:28.820> and<00:01:29.820> scale

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:43.330 

so<00:01:36.359> this<00:01:36.630> is<00:01:36.750> it<00:01:36.979> and<00:01:41.060> the<00:01:42.060> next<00:01:42.240> is<00:01:43.140> a

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
so this is it and the next is a

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.639 
so this is it and the next is a
transformation<00:01:44.340> widget<00:01:44.700> I<00:01:44.850> did<00:01:45.179> two<00:01:45.329> groups

00:01:45.639 --> 00:01:45.649 
transformation widget I did two groups

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:50.840 
transformation widget I did two groups
so<00:01:46.649> we<00:01:46.860> don't<00:01:47.070> need<00:01:47.280> to<00:01:47.460> change<00:01:48.799> our<00:01:49.799> values<00:01:50.100> in

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
so we don't need to change our values in

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.249 
so we don't need to change our values in
transformation<00:01:51.719> parameters<00:01:52.350> we<00:01:52.979> just<00:01:53.310> can

00:01:54.249 --> 00:01:54.259 
transformation parameters we just can

00:01:54.259 --> 00:02:00.020 
transformation parameters we just can
manipulate<00:01:57.259> the<00:01:58.259> group<00:01:58.530> using<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:59.030> handles

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:00.030 
manipulate the group using the handles

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:06.109 
manipulate the group using the handles
so<00:02:00.709> we<00:02:01.709> can<00:02:01.950> move<00:02:02.789> it<00:02:03.000> we<00:02:03.450> can<00:02:03.689> rotate<00:02:03.990> it<00:02:05.119> we

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
so we can move it we can rotate it we

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:12.220 
so we can move it we can rotate it we
can<00:02:06.329> scale<00:02:06.719> it<00:02:07.519> by<00:02:08.519> X<00:02:08.819> exists<00:02:09.599> by<00:02:09.929> y<00:02:10.619> exists<00:02:11.370> and

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
can scale it by X exists by y exists and

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:17.030 
can scale it by X exists by y exists and
both<00:02:13.230> XS<00:02:14.450> with<00:02:15.450> this<00:02:15.690> handle<00:02:16.140> this<00:02:16.799> handle

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
both XS with this handle this handle

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.460 
both XS with this handle this handle
should<00:02:17.430> be<00:02:17.549> placed<00:02:17.819> at<00:02:18.000> a<00:02:18.420> different<00:02:19.049> place

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
should be placed at a different place

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:31.539 
should be placed at a different place
but<00:02:20.510> its<00:02:21.709> thing<00:02:22.709> to<00:02:22.920> do<00:02:23.099> in<00:02:23.880> this<00:02:24.569> issue<00:02:27.890> okay

00:02:31.539 --> 00:02:31.549 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:40.610 

we<00:02:32.549> also<00:02:32.760> can<00:02:33.150> mirror<00:02:36.079> the<00:02:37.079> object<00:02:38.030> by<00:02:39.030> X<00:02:39.390> or<00:02:39.780> Y

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
we also can mirror the object by X or Y

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:49.220 
we also can mirror the object by X or Y
axis<00:02:41.250> or<00:02:42.530> also<00:02:43.530> both<00:02:43.980> axes

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:55.500 

like<00:02:50.040> this

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:55.510 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:03:03.160 

okay<00:02:57.880> next<00:03:00.400> you<00:03:01.400> can<00:03:01.610> use<00:03:01.850> the<00:03:02.330> mouse<00:03:02.510> to<00:03:02.900> shift

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:03.170 
okay next you can use the mouse to shift

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:06.370 
okay next you can use the mouse to shift
the<00:03:03.440> origin<00:03:04.190> of<00:03:04.570> transformation<00:03:05.570> by<00:03:05.810> holding

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:06.380 
the origin of transformation by holding

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:10.590 
the origin of transformation by holding
the<00:03:06.740> spacebar<00:03:07.210> if<00:03:08.210> you<00:03:08.360> hold<00:03:08.630> the<00:03:08.900> spacebar

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:10.600 
the spacebar if you hold the spacebar

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:19.310 
the spacebar if you hold the spacebar
then<00:03:12.880> you<00:03:13.880> can

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:19.320 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:24.810 

move<00:03:20.320> the<00:03:21.570> origin<00:03:22.570> of<00:03:23.110> transformation<00:03:24.010> let<00:03:24.640> me

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:24.820 
move the origin of transformation let me

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:27.600 
move the origin of transformation let me
illustrate<00:03:24.880> this<00:03:25.210> with<00:03:25.590> a<00:03:26.590> pure<00:03:27.190> moon

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.610 
illustrate this with a pure moon

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:41.990 
illustrate this with a pure moon
transform<00:03:28.090> it<00:03:28.210> group<00:03:30.690> something<00:03:31.690> like<00:03:31.900> this

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:42.000 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.360 

so<00:03:42.630> heaven<00:03:43.080> transformation<00:03:43.770> widget<00:03:44.160> and

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
so heaven transformation widget and

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:50.210 
so heaven transformation widget and
holding<00:03:45.300> space<00:03:45.830> will<00:03:46.830> move<00:03:47.610> the<00:03:47.970> origin<00:03:49.220> and

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
holding space will move the origin and

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:59.090 
holding space will move the origin and
now<00:03:50.460> we<00:03:50.520> can<00:03:50.970> manipulate<00:03:51.180> it<00:03:51.660> as<00:03:51.900> we<00:03:52.170> like<00:03:58.100> now

00:03:59.090 --> 00:03:59.100 
now we can manipulate it as we like now

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:02.930 
now we can manipulate it as we like now
I<00:03:59.430> would<00:03:59.880> like<00:04:00.060> to<00:04:00.120> explain<00:04:00.900> why<00:04:01.610> all<00:04:02.610> this

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
I would like to explain why all this

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:07.160 
I would like to explain why all this
stuff<00:04:03.120> about<00:04:03.920> group<00:04:04.920> transformation<00:04:06.170> have

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
stuff about group transformation have

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:12.680 
stuff about group transformation have
been<00:04:07.470> done<00:04:08.450> this<00:04:09.450> have<00:04:09.750> been<00:04:09.960> done<00:04:10.200> to<00:04:11.690> allow

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690 
been done this have been done to allow

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:19.160 
been done this have been done to allow
linking<00:04:13.560> the<00:04:14.010> groups<00:04:14.540> to<00:04:15.540> the<00:04:15.840> bones<00:04:17.359> to<00:04:18.359> allow

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:19.170 
linking the groups to the bones to allow

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:22.930 
linking the groups to the bones to allow
easily<00:04:19.739> create<00:04:20.190> a<00:04:20.459> cut<00:04:21.239> out<00:04:21.420> style<00:04:22.140> animation

00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:22.940 
easily create a cut out style animation

00:04:22.940 --> 00:04:32.590 
easily create a cut out style animation
these<00:04:23.940> bones<00:04:25.280> so<00:04:26.810> let's<00:04:29.690> see<00:04:30.690> how<00:04:30.990> this<00:04:31.710> works

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:32.600 
these bones so let's see how this works

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:38.960 
these bones so let's see how this works
at<00:04:33.600> the<00:04:33.930> moment<00:04:35.240> we<00:04:36.240> have<00:04:36.680> Lincoln<00:04:37.680> group<00:04:38.310> to

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:38.970 
at the moment we have Lincoln group to

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:43.310 
at the moment we have Lincoln group to
the<00:04:39.120> bone<00:04:39.300> implemented<00:04:40.140> and<00:04:40.350> it<00:04:41.340> is<00:04:41.730> done<00:04:42.720> by

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:43.320 
the bone implemented and it is done by

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:46.730 
the bone implemented and it is done by
using<00:04:43.590> the<00:04:43.770> convert<00:04:44.280> type<00:04:44.930> but<00:04:45.930> first<00:04:46.230> let's

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:46.740 
using the convert type but first let's

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:49.100 
using the convert type but first let's
add<00:04:47.100> a<00:04:47.930> skeleton

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:49.110 
add a skeleton

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:54.370 
add a skeleton
let's<00:04:49.860> choose<00:04:50.160> layer<00:04:50.820> a<00:04:51.300> new<00:04:52.260> layer<00:04:52.500> author

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:54.380 
let's choose layer a new layer author

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:58.100 
let's choose layer a new layer author
skeleton<00:04:55.730> so<00:04:56.730> we<00:04:57.030> have<00:04:57.240> a<00:04:57.270> skeleton<00:04:57.900> layer

00:04:58.100 --> 00:04:58.110 
skeleton so we have a skeleton layer

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:03.800 
skeleton so we have a skeleton layer
with<00:04:58.410> just<00:04:59.810> one<00:05:00.810> bone<00:05:01.940> which<00:05:02.940> we<00:05:03.120> can<00:05:03.330> rotate

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:03.810 
with just one bone which we can rotate

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:12.580 
with just one bone which we can rotate
or<00:05:04.200> scale<00:05:04.350> and<00:05:06.919> let's<00:05:07.919> add<00:05:08.280> a<00:05:09.080> few<00:05:10.080> more<00:05:10.110> bones

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:12.590 
or scale and let's add a few more bones

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:23.100 
or scale and let's add a few more bones
right<00:05:13.590> click<00:05:15.140> result<00:05:16.910> and<00:05:18.860> one<00:05:19.860> more

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:23.110 

00:05:23.110 --> 00:05:27.100 

obviously<00:05:24.110> in<00:05:24.379> the<00:05:24.559> future<00:05:24.979> in<00:05:25.519> the<00:05:26.059> future<00:05:26.329> we

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:27.110 
obviously in the future in the future we

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:33.189 
obviously in the future in the future we
have<00:05:27.409> to<00:05:29.619> make<00:05:30.619> a<00:05:30.919> special<00:05:31.759> tool<00:05:32.659> to<00:05:32.989> create

00:05:33.189 --> 00:05:33.199 
have to make a special tool to create

00:05:33.199 --> 00:05:36.489 
have to make a special tool to create
the<00:05:33.469> skeletons<00:05:34.039> but<00:05:34.729> at<00:05:35.509> the<00:05:35.719> moment<00:05:35.899> this<00:05:36.439> is

00:05:36.489 --> 00:05:36.499 
the skeletons but at the moment this is

00:05:36.499 --> 00:05:41.229 
the skeletons but at the moment this is
done<00:05:36.829> like<00:05:37.159> this<00:05:37.659> and<00:05:39.519> now<00:05:40.519> let's<00:05:40.879> create<00:05:41.059> a

00:05:41.229 --> 00:05:41.239 
done like this and now let's create a

00:05:41.239 --> 00:05:56.140 
done like this and now let's create a
group<00:05:41.539> to<00:05:43.839> link<00:05:44.860> to<00:05:45.860> our<00:05:46.189> skeleton<00:05:49.299> with<00:05:50.299> this

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:56.150 

00:05:56.150 --> 00:05:57.960 

okay

00:05:57.960 --> 00:05:57.970 
okay

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:04.450 
okay
so<00:05:58.970> we<00:05:59.150> have<00:05:59.360> a<00:05:59.389> group<00:05:59.720> and<00:06:02.919> when<00:06:03.919> we<00:06:04.250> have

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:04.460 
so we have a group and when we have

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:07.379 
so we have a group and when we have
created<00:06:04.909> a<00:06:05.030> skeleton<00:06:05.569> we<00:06:05.870> have<00:06:06.110> a<00:06:06.349> three<00:06:06.590> bones

00:06:07.379 --> 00:06:07.389 
created a skeleton we have a three bones

00:06:07.389 --> 00:06:11.680 
created a skeleton we have a three bones
each<00:06:08.389> bone<00:06:08.810> have<00:06:09.470> a<00:06:10.099> particular<00:06:11.030> name

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:11.690 
each bone have a particular name

00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:16.689 
each bone have a particular name
this<00:06:12.289> is<00:06:12.409> born<00:06:12.650> 3<00:06:13.099> this<00:06:13.580> is<00:06:13.789> born<00:06:14.090> -<00:06:14.750> and<00:06:15.699> this

00:06:16.689 --> 00:06:16.699 
this is born 3 this is born - and this

00:06:16.699 --> 00:06:20.439 
this is born 3 this is born - and this
is<00:06:16.849> born<00:06:17.090> one<00:06:17.360> let's<00:06:17.810> try<00:06:18.139> to<00:06:18.259> link<00:06:18.620> our<00:06:19.449> group

00:06:20.439 --> 00:06:20.449 
is born one let's try to link our group

00:06:20.449 --> 00:06:21.460 
is born one let's try to link our group
to<00:06:20.750> the<00:06:20.990> bone

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:21.470 
to the bone

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:26.610 
to the bone
-<00:06:21.849> so<00:06:22.849> we<00:06:23.539> go<00:06:23.870> to<00:06:24.879> the<00:06:25.879> transformation

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:26.620 
- so we go to the transformation

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:29.740 
- so we go to the transformation
parameter<00:06:27.620> and<00:06:27.830> convert<00:06:28.729> it<00:06:28.940> into<00:06:29.150> a<00:06:29.449> bone

00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:29.750 
parameter and convert it into a bone

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:43.140 
parameter and convert it into a bone
link<00:06:34.000> in<00:06:35.000> the<00:06:35.270> future<00:06:37.449> we<00:06:38.449> plan<00:06:38.719> to<00:06:39.129> implement

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:43.150 

00:06:43.150 --> 00:06:51.459 

perdon<00:06:46.060> we<00:06:47.060> plan<00:06:47.300> to<00:06:47.509> implement<00:06:47.919> a<00:06:50.469> Lincoln

00:06:51.459 --> 00:06:51.469 
perdon we plan to implement a Lincoln

00:06:51.469 --> 00:06:55.920 
perdon we plan to implement a Lincoln
group<00:06:51.770> to<00:06:51.979> the<00:06:52.129> bone<00:06:52.310> using<00:06:52.669> the<00:06:52.969> mouse<00:06:53.150> but<00:06:53.930> it

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:55.930 
group to the bone using the mouse but it

00:06:55.930 --> 00:07:00.209 
group to the bone using the mouse but it
is<00:06:56.930> not<00:06:57.169> done<00:06:57.620> yet<00:06:57.889> so<00:06:58.250> we<00:06:58.460> have<00:06:58.490> to<00:06:59.060> use<00:06:59.240> the

00:07:00.209 --> 00:07:00.219 
is not done yet so we have to use the

00:07:00.219 --> 00:07:03.149 
is not done yet so we have to use the
convert<00:07:01.219> type<00:07:01.490> manually<00:07:02.060> so<00:07:02.419> let's<00:07:02.719> choose<00:07:02.960> a

00:07:03.149 --> 00:07:03.159 
convert type manually so let's choose a

00:07:03.159 --> 00:07:08.920 
convert type manually so let's choose a
group<00:07:04.300> group<00:07:05.300> two<00:07:06.279> booklets<00:07:07.279> useable<00:07:08.000> bone<00:07:08.690> -

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:08.930 
group group two booklets useable bone -

00:07:08.930 --> 00:07:16.089 
group group two booklets useable bone -
and<00:07:09.169> you<00:07:10.099> can<00:07:10.310> see<00:07:11.650> the<00:07:13.870> group<00:07:14.870> is<00:07:15.259> linked<00:07:15.860> to

00:07:16.089 --> 00:07:16.099 
and you can see the group is linked to

00:07:16.099 --> 00:07:22.269 
and you can see the group is linked to
the<00:07:16.250> bone<00:07:16.430> we<00:07:17.029> can

00:07:22.269 --> 00:07:22.279 

00:07:22.279 --> 00:07:26.379 

change<00:07:22.999> it

00:07:26.379 --> 00:07:26.389 

00:07:26.389 --> 00:07:35.409 

or<00:07:27.039> rotate<00:07:28.180> or<00:07:29.180> scale<00:07:31.629> etc<00:07:33.219> also<00:07:34.219> we<00:07:34.490> can<00:07:34.939> link

00:07:35.409 --> 00:07:35.419 
or rotate or scale etc also we can link

00:07:35.419 --> 00:07:37.860 
or rotate or scale etc also we can link
to<00:07:35.930> this<00:07:36.080> group<00:07:36.409> to<00:07:36.439> another<00:07:37.009> bone

00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:37.870 
to this group to another bone

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:44.189 
to this group to another bone
let's<00:07:38.870> choose<00:07:39.110> bone<00:07:39.409> three<00:07:41.169> so<00:07:42.169> it<00:07:42.650> sees<00:07:43.159> now

00:07:44.189 --> 00:07:44.199 
let's choose bone three so it sees now

00:07:44.199 --> 00:07:56.140 
let's choose bone three so it sees now
link<00:07:45.199> it<00:07:49.030> to<00:07:50.030> the<00:07:50.090> boundary<00:07:53.650> so<00:07:54.650> this<00:07:55.159> is<00:07:55.370> what

00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:56.150 
link it to the boundary so this is what

00:07:56.150 --> 00:07:59.740 
link it to the boundary so this is what
we<00:07:56.389> have<00:07:56.740> implemented<00:07:57.740> at<00:07:58.240> the<00:07:59.240> current

00:07:59.740 --> 00:07:59.750 
we have implemented at the current

00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:04.149 
we have implemented at the current
moment<00:08:01.240> we<00:08:02.240> still<00:08:02.479> have<00:08:02.840> a<00:08:02.870> lot<00:08:03.229> of<00:08:03.259> things<00:08:03.860> to

00:08:04.149 --> 00:08:04.159 
moment we still have a lot of things to

00:08:04.159 --> 00:08:09.490 
moment we still have a lot of things to
do<00:08:04.629> but<00:08:05.629> I<00:08:06.729> hope<00:08:07.729> you<00:08:07.969> like<00:08:08.210> the<00:08:08.659> first<00:08:08.960> results

00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:09.500 
do but I hope you like the first results

00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:13.659 
do but I hope you like the first results
just<00:08:10.430> demonstrated<00:08:11.300> here
