00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
seen a nice bright red one will work

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.680 
seen a nice bright red one will work
really<00:00:31.349> well<00:00:31.640> so<00:00:32.640> then<00:00:33.149> what<00:00:33.329> you<00:00:33.390> want<00:00:33.510> to<00:00:33.540> do

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:33.690 
really well so then what you want to do

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.150 
really well so then what you want to do
once<00:00:33.930> you've<00:00:34.079> painted<00:00:34.200> your<00:00:34.440> nails<00:00:34.500> all<00:00:34.860> white

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
once you've painted your nails all white

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.860 
once you've painted your nails all white
is<00:00:35.489> you<00:00:35.550> want<00:00:35.820> to<00:00:35.940> grab<00:00:36.059> some<00:00:36.120> tape<00:00:36.480> because<00:00:36.690> it

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
is you want to grab some tape because it

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.840 
is you want to grab some tape because it
can<00:00:37.020> get<00:00:37.170> quite<00:00:37.380> messy<00:00:37.500> and<00:00:38.040> I<00:00:38.460> think<00:00:38.760> it's

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
can get quite messy and I think it's

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.310 
can get quite messy and I think it's
easier<00:00:39.210> to<00:00:39.300> do<00:00:39.390> it<00:00:39.480> this<00:00:39.510> way<00:00:39.780> around<00:00:40.020> then<00:00:40.230> to

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
easier to do it this way around then to

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.319 
easier to do it this way around then to
try<00:00:40.500> and<00:00:40.620> clear<00:00:40.829> up<00:00:41.010> later<00:00:41.129> so<00:00:41.969> I'm<00:00:42.030> going<00:00:42.239> to

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
try and clear up later so I'm going to

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:45.979 
try and clear up later so I'm going to
grab<00:00:42.660> three<00:00:43.110> bits<00:00:43.350> of<00:00:43.469> tape<00:00:43.620> /<00:00:43.920> nail<00:00:44.160> and<00:00:44.989> stick

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
grab three bits of tape / nail and stick

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:55.459 
grab three bits of tape / nail and stick
one<00:00:46.350> bit<00:00:46.620> along<00:00:47.430> the<00:00:47.460> side<00:00:47.879> like<00:00:48.450> that<00:00:54.469> another

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
one bit along the side like that another

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:03.619 
one bit along the side like that another
bit<00:00:55.739> along<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.100> other<00:00:56.370> side

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.460 

and<00:01:04.629> then<00:01:05.170> the<00:01:05.590> third<00:01:05.620> bit<00:01:06.280> along<00:01:06.820> the<00:01:06.850> bottom

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
and then the third bit along the bottom

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.510 
and then the third bit along the bottom
so<00:01:08.470> you<00:01:08.500> end<00:01:08.710> up<00:01:08.770> with<00:01:08.830> something<00:01:09.040> like<00:01:09.190> that

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:09.520 
so you end up with something like that

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:10.860
