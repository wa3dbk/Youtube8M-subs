 we want to tell you how to get your 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.620
 car 220 volt outlet 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.620
 go 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.300
 this thing is called inverter probably 

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:28.360
 many people know he is only 150 

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:30.759
 watt for example recharge laptop computer 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:33.519
 I do not know maybe on the same laptops 

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:35.379
 Well, itâ€™s not important for different movies 

00:00:33.519 --> 00:00:37.989
 goals can be yes naturally Bulgarian 

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:39.220
 you connect to it, and here 

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:41.620
 present yizbi 

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:44.019
 that is, you can charge for example also 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:46.030
 I do not know the phone may be a navigator 

00:00:44.019 --> 00:00:48.000
 or something else is also here 

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.750
 there is a power button off 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.660
 present on this side 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.860
 20 amp fuse and 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:57.820
 fan hole present 

00:00:53.860 --> 00:01:00.670
 so that our inverter does not overheat with 

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:04.539
 On this side, the 220 volt socket itself 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:08.460
 we need to make start the car further 

00:01:04.539 --> 00:01:13.060
 we need to connect the inverter 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:15.610
 cigarette lighter and turn it on 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:21.000
 the strawberry lights the fan starts 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:21.000
 spin like crazy put 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:27.680
 we take annoyed netbook 40 percent on 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.759
 netbook 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:35.470
 take charge of it we connect 

00:01:30.759 --> 00:01:36.590
 turn on charging lit letters here he is 

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:39.460
 turned on 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.460
 charging went 

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:45.290
 such miracles 

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:48.649
 from 12 volts we get v 220 volts 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:51.860
 through inverter like inverter 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:54.890
 there are different there are 300 watts there are 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:57.320
 at 500 watts 600 700 and so on even 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:59.539
 there in my 1000-something that is 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:02.610
 already kilowatt and the pain is, respectively 

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:04.500
 there it is already possible to connect the grinder 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:12.060
 I don't know, maybe even a microwave 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:14.310
 kettle yes but this is the easiest of it 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:17.280
 Convenience is that you can just 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:21.540
 plug in the cigarette lighter and nothing 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:23.430
 think of those who have more power them 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.060
 must be connected to the battery 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:26.280
 directly 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:29.400
 he has thick wires in him already 

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:30.390
 crab there is you connect and 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.860
 use 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.500
 that is, you can for example with yourself 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:37.260
 somewhere on nature take or else 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.120
 somewhere as I said you can 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:42.150
 Now the laptop is charging and you can 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:45.870
 pick up a phone for example charging 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:47.790
 put a charge for that while aunt u 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.280
 there you will not come on aunt 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.660
 watch this video we filmed in order 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:54.330
 so that you understand that we are not going anywhere 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:56.280
 disappeared that is, we must 

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:58.739
