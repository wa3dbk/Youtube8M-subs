00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.680 

we<00:01:06.190> use<00:01:06.310> this<00:01:06.490> function<00:01:06.760> so<00:01:07.030> we<00:01:07.270> can<00:01:07.450> place

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:07.690 
we use this function so we can place

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:10.320 
we use this function so we can place
units<00:01:08.140> inside<00:01:08.530> a<00:01:08.590> vehicle<00:01:08.920> before<00:01:09.850> the<00:01:10.060> start

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:10.330

units inside a vehicle before the start
of<00:01:10.420> the<00:01:10.510> mission<00:01:13.260> with<00:01:14.260> everything<00:01:14.680> set<00:01:14.950> up

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.100 
of the mission with everything set up

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.590 
of the mission with everything set up
the<00:01:15.280> last<00:01:15.490> thing<00:01:15.790> to<00:01:15.910> do<00:01:16.060> is<00:01:16.090> set<00:01:16.450> the

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:16.600 
the last thing to do is set the

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.020 
the last thing to do is set the
helicopter<00:01:17.260> to<00:01:17.410> flying<00:01:17.770> or<00:01:18.280> else<00:01:18.460> it'll<00:01:18.730> start

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:19.030 
helicopter to flying or else it'll start

helicopter to flying or else it'll start
on<00:01:19.180> the<00:01:19.300> ground<00:01:19.570> and<00:01:19.810> have<00:01:19.900> to<00:01:20.080> spool<00:01:20.350> up<00:01:20.620> and

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:20.830 
on the ground and have to spool up and

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:23.970 
on the ground and have to spool up and
take<00:01:21.010> off<00:01:21.220> and<00:01:21.990> we<00:01:22.990> give<00:01:23.170> it<00:01:23.260> a<00:01:23.320> waypoint<00:01:23.770> for

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:23.980 
take off and we give it a waypoint for

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:34.340 
take off and we give it a waypoint for
transport<00:01:24.970> onload

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.920 

next<00:01:35.130> I'll<00:01:35.250> place<00:01:35.490> a<00:01:35.520> loiterer<00:01:36.150> Waypoint<00:01:36.690> so

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
next I'll place a loiterer Waypoint so

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:38.750 
next I'll place a loiterer Waypoint so
that<00:01:37.110> it<00:01:37.229> leaves<00:01:37.380> the<00:01:37.680> area<00:01:37.979> after<00:01:38.159> inserting

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:38.760 
that it leaves the area after inserting

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:45.430 
that it leaves the area after inserting
the<00:01:39.060> troops

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:45.440 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.810 

now<00:01:46.440> I'll<00:01:46.590> preview<00:01:46.830> it<00:01:47.130> so<00:01:47.280> you<00:01:47.370> can<00:01:47.520> see<00:01:47.700> how

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
now I'll preview it so you can see how

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.310 
now I'll preview it so you can see how
it<00:01:47.940> works

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.750 

as<00:01:53.320> you<00:01:53.500> can<00:01:53.620> see<00:01:53.800> here<00:01:54.070> the<00:01:54.220> troops<00:01:54.460> are<00:01:54.640> all

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:54.760 
as you can see here the troops are all

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:56.370 
as you can see here the troops are all
inside<00:01:55.090> the<00:01:55.270> helicopter<00:01:55.930> and<00:01:56.080> we're<00:01:56.229> on<00:01:56.350> our

inside the helicopter and we're on our

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:58.710 
inside the helicopter and we're on our
way<00:01:56.530> to<00:01:56.650> unload<00:01:57.159> at<00:01:57.340> the<00:01:57.370> Waypoint<00:01:57.880> I'll<00:01:58.300> speed

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:58.720 
way to unload at the Waypoint I'll speed

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:07.490 
way to unload at the Waypoint I'll speed
this<00:01:58.750> up

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:12.930 

this<00:02:08.429> man

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.460 

standing<00:02:13.360> by

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.770 

and<00:02:17.370> now<00:02:17.520> with<00:02:17.700> the<00:02:17.790> troops<00:02:18.060> unloaded<00:02:18.630> it

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
and now with the troops unloaded it

heads towards a loiterer Waypoint
waiting<00:02:26.120> now<00:02:27.120> we'll<00:02:27.300> learn<00:02:27.450> how<00:02:27.510> to<00:02:27.660> create<00:02:27.930> an

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
waiting now we'll learn how to create an

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.990 
waiting now we'll learn how to create an
extraction<00:02:28.620> for<00:02:29.190> this<00:02:29.340> purpose<00:02:29.760> we'll<00:02:29.910> be

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
extraction for this purpose we'll be

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.240 
extraction for this purpose we'll be
creating<00:02:30.540> an<00:02:30.630> op<00:02:30.780> for<00:02:31.110> a<00:02:31.140> unit<00:02:31.440> and<00:02:32.010> I'll<00:02:32.100> be

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:32.250 
creating an op for a unit and I'll be

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:34.190 
creating an op for a unit and I'll be
naming<00:02:32.490> each<00:02:32.790> of<00:02:33.000> them<00:02:33.150> for<00:02:33.750> use<00:02:33.930> with<00:02:34.170> the

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
naming each of them for use with the

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:58.880 
naming each of them for use with the
switch<00:02:34.560> trigger<00:02:34.950> that<00:02:35.190> we'll<00:02:35.280> be<00:02:35.370> using<00:02:35.490> later

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:01.220 

I<00:02:58.980> set<00:02:59.670> up<00:02:59.700> a<00:02:59.910> load<00:03:00.120> wavelength<00:03:00.750> to<00:03:00.870> pick<00:03:01.080> up

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.230 
I set up a load wavelength to pick up

00:03:01.230 --> 00:03:03.020 
I set up a load wavelength to pick up
the<00:03:01.410> troops<00:03:01.650> once<00:03:02.010> they<00:03:02.220> eliminate<00:03:02.670> the<00:03:02.850> OPFOR

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
the troops once they eliminate the OPFOR

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:17.110 
the troops once they eliminate the OPFOR
unit

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.550 

then<00:03:18.120> I<00:03:18.240> give<00:03:18.420> it<00:03:18.540> a<00:03:18.570> waypoint<00:03:18.750> to<00:03:19.200> leave<00:03:19.350> the

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:19.560 
then I give it a waypoint to leave the

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:24.020 
then I give it a waypoint to leave the
area<00:03:19.740> once<00:03:20.130> the<00:03:20.220> mission<00:03:20.610> is<00:03:20.700> completed<00:03:23.030> to

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
area once the mission is completed to

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:25.790 
area once the mission is completed to
stop<00:03:24.270> the<00:03:24.450> helicopter<00:03:25.080> from<00:03:25.290> loading<00:03:25.680> the

stop the helicopter from loading the

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.100 
stop the helicopter from loading the
troops<00:03:26.040> before<00:03:26.640> the<00:03:26.940> up<00:03:27.060> for<00:03:27.390> the<00:03:27.750> unit<00:03:27.990> is

troops before the up for the unit is

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:29.660 
troops before the up for the unit is
eliminated<00:03:28.680> we<00:03:28.830> use<00:03:28.980> a<00:03:29.010> switch<00:03:29.310> trigger

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
eliminated we use a switch trigger

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:31.810 
eliminated we use a switch trigger
inside<00:03:30.540> the<00:03:30.690> conditioned<00:03:31.170> field<00:03:31.410> we<00:03:31.650> type

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:31.820 
inside the conditioned field we type

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:34.370 
inside the conditioned field we type
exclamation<00:03:32.820> mark<00:03:33.030> alive<00:03:33.510> followed<00:03:34.140> by<00:03:34.320> the
