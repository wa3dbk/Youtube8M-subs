00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:44.480 
side and you can see we have three

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:50.330 
side and you can see we have three
buttons<00:00:45.480> here<00:00:45.600> for<00:00:47.600> procured<00:00:48.890> the<00:00:49.890> first<00:00:50.129> one

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
buttons here for procured the first one

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.170 
buttons here for procured the first one
is<00:00:50.520> default<00:00:51.149> one<00:00:51.360> but<00:00:51.899> most<00:00:52.050> users<00:00:52.530> use<00:00:53.180> the

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
is default one but most users use the

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.990 
is default one but most users use the
second<00:00:54.449> one<00:00:54.570> is<00:00:54.750> the<00:00:54.960> minified<00:00:55.410> one<00:00:56.070> it<00:00:56.760> takes

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
second one is the minified one it takes

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:03.090 
second one is the minified one it takes
a<00:00:57.420> bit<00:00:57.719> less<00:00:58.219> bandwidth<00:00:59.570> so<00:01:00.570> if<00:01:00.899> you<00:01:01.079> have<00:01:01.260> a

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.100 
a bit less bandwidth so if you have a

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.260 
a bit less bandwidth so if you have a
that<00:01:03.850> connection<00:01:04.420> our<00:01:05.670> limited<00:01:06.670> bandwidth

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:07.270 
that connection our limited bandwidth

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.649 
that connection our limited bandwidth
this<00:01:07.930> is<00:01:08.049> the<00:01:08.290> one<00:01:08.470> we<00:01:08.740> recommend<00:01:09.450> it<00:01:10.450> also

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:10.659 
this is the one we recommend it also

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:14.160 
this is the one we recommend it also
gets<00:01:11.259> some<00:01:11.940> optimizations<00:01:12.940> compared<00:01:13.690> to<00:01:13.930> the

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:14.170 
gets some optimizations compared to the

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:19.109 
gets some optimizations compared to the
default<00:01:14.830> one<00:01:15.040> and<00:01:16.259> thus<00:01:17.259> we<00:01:18.189> have<00:01:18.399> the<00:01:18.790> jutsu

00:01:19.109 --> 00:01:19.119 
default one and thus we have the jutsu

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:21.840 
default one and thus we have the jutsu
squared<00:01:19.920> if<00:01:20.920> you<00:01:21.130> know<00:01:21.250> what<00:01:21.430> I<00:01:21.460> used<00:01:21.580> to

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:21.850 
squared if you know what I used to

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.960 
squared if you know what I used to
address<00:01:22.119> this<00:01:22.659> is<00:01:22.869> probably<00:01:23.229> the<00:01:23.970> solution

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:24.970 
address this is probably the solution

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:29.639 
address this is probably the solution
for<00:01:25.180> you<00:01:25.299> because<00:01:25.869> this<00:01:26.289> will<00:01:27.899> also<00:01:28.899> run<00:01:29.170> plug

00:01:29.639 --> 00:01:29.649 
for you because this will also run plug

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:33.950 
for you because this will also run plug
shoot<00:01:29.920> without<00:01:30.340> having<00:01:30.990> to<00:01:31.990> use<00:01:32.170> a<00:01:32.200> bookmark

shoot without having to use a bookmark
and<00:01:35.009> some<00:01:36.009> browsers<00:01:36.369> support<00:01:37.300> this<00:01:37.479> natively

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.350 
and some browsers support this natively

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:43.050 
and some browsers support this natively
and<00:01:38.740> some<00:01:39.330> requires<00:01:40.330> an<00:01:40.539> extension<00:01:41.880> but<00:01:42.880> as<00:01:43.030> I

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 
and some requires an extension but as I

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.910 
and some requires an extension but as I
said<00:01:43.390> default<00:01:44.229> is<00:01:44.500> this<00:01:44.740> first<00:01:45.130> one<00:01:45.690> simply

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
said default is this first one simply

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.840 
said default is this first one simply
drag<00:01:47.920> and<00:01:48.490> drop<00:01:48.550> to<00:01:49.360> a<00:01:49.390> toolbar<00:01:49.979> and<00:01:50.979> then<00:01:51.640> you

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:51.850 
drag and drop to a toolbar and then you

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.469 
drag and drop to a toolbar and then you
have<00:01:52.030> it<00:01:52.179> set<00:01:52.720> up<00:01:52.750> ready<00:01:53.470> for<00:01:53.920> use<00:01:54.039> so<00:01:54.909> if<00:01:55.090> we<00:01:55.270> go

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:55.479 
have it set up ready for use so if we go

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:02.190 
have it set up ready for use so if we go

and<00:02:36.240> that's<00:02:37.240> basically<00:02:37.540> how<00:02:37.990> I<00:02:38.020> set<00:02:38.260> up<00:02:39.000> all

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
and that's basically how I set up all

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.070 
and that's basically how I set up all
the<00:02:40.420> settings<00:02:40.540> up<00:02:41.260> here<00:02:42.060> if<00:02:43.060> you<00:02:43.390> want<00:02:43.780> to<00:02:43.930> use

the settings up here if you want to use

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.449 
the settings up here if you want to use
commands<00:02:44.470> cells<00:02:45.040> you<00:02:45.220> use<00:02:45.760> slash<00:02:46.360> commands<00:02:47.459> to

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
commands cells you use slash commands to

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:54.500 
commands cells you use slash commands to
get<00:02:48.640> information<00:02:49.240> about<00:02:49.780> the<00:02:49.900> clients<00:02:50.760> and

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:54.510 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.980 

that's<00:02:55.080> basically<00:02:55.590> it

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:56.990 
that's basically it

00:02:56.990 --> 00:03:00.820
