00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:05.930
 well everyone in this video I'm going to 

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:07.340
 teach how to delineate your eyes and make wind 

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:09.590
 eyeliner that I really have no idea 

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:10.400
 how to say but in itself is this list 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:13.340
 what's wrong with it 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:16.070
 I have a hair in the mouth is the palita 

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:17.900
 corner of the wolf and many times I 've 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.820
 sent messages saying like maquis 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:23.599
 very difficult that I have two eyes 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:26.659
 same and I have to confess them I was 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:28.970
 awful doing it very little 

00:00:26.659 --> 00:00:31.789
 I literally could not get both of them 

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:34.790
 two eyes will remain the same simply 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:37.070
 I have a disaster but recently 

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:39.470
 I discovered a little trick that is 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.240
 helping a lot so that I stay then 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.610
 similar ones are obviously going to be 

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:45.860
 totally the same and that look very 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:49.060
 well then you are going to do them in this 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:49.060
 video I hope you serve them 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.719
 The first thing we are going to do is take 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:55.730
 a thin brush and position the 

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:58.810
 can see where it's going to happen and the 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:01.330
 of our delineated 

00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:03.610
 the next step is to make face 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:05.730
 of brava you need to lower your eyebrows and 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:07.830
 look more 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:09.990
 and this is going to help you notice a lot 

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.920
 more the crease of the eye so you're going to 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:15.259
 find the end of this one 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.689
 and then you're going to take your eyeliner either 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:21.070
 gel liquid in pencil and you're going to make a 

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:21.070
 puntito to guide you 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.030
 and then you're going to follow a line 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:31.970
 imaginary as if you were 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:34.460
 delineating the bottom of your eye and 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:36.890
 you're going to take it to the point and you're going to 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:39.820
 start filling that thick list 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:39.820
 as you want 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.840
 I prefer to do these five steps 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.670
 before finishing the whole eye since it is 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.410
 the hardest part so now 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.960
 we only need how easy it is 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:57.850
 delineate just the little part above 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.850
 of the eye well attached to the eyelashes 

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:02.370
 now you're going to have to decide how 

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:04.560
 thick you want your delineated when 

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:07.260
 you have done you are going to put the tip of your 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:10.740
 eyeliner on the tip of the wing and you're going 

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:14.300
 to bring to your tear he goes to 

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:14.300
 slide naturally 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:21.190
 and since we are not professionals 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.900
 it probably did not look perfect but 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:25.209
 just do not worry they can take a 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.560
 copito and 10 make-up artist and fix her 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:30.080
 to 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:32.480
 and then a little concealer to cover 

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:35.800
 the red part that we left and also 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:35.800
 any rest of the eyeliner 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:46.760
 and there they have it then they just have to 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.530
 follow the same steps in the other eye and 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.500
 they will be very delineated 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:53.450
 seemed not perfect but it seems to me that 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:56.420
 It looks great and makes your eyes look 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.920
 see enormous good especially for hope 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:59.600
