Subtitledtrailers.com

00:00:32.991 --> 00:00:34.543
We are human beings.

00:00:36.795 --> 00:00:38.313
Each and everyone of us.

00:00:41.032 --> 00:00:42.617
This must not go on.

00:00:43.495 --> 00:00:45.654
This injustice must end!

00:00:47.848 --> 00:00:49.291
An increase in the number

00:00:49.541 --> 00:00:52.661
of terrorist attacks
highlights the danger posed

00:00:52.911 --> 00:00:54.296
by augmented citizens.

00:00:54.907 --> 00:00:57.399
I once thought
I could save the world.

00:00:57.844 --> 00:00:59.167
Now look at it.

00:00:59.417 --> 00:01:00.302
Help me!

00:01:17.402 --> 00:01:19.447
Sometimes, you just have to let go

00:01:19.697 --> 00:01:21.747
and embrace what you've become.

00:01:24.371 --> 00:01:26.921
They've worked
from the shadows for years,

00:01:27.171 --> 00:01:28.621
shaping the future,

00:01:28.871 --> 00:01:30.321
manipulating lives,

00:01:30.797 --> 00:01:32.561
controlling the information.

00:01:32.811 --> 00:01:34.236
Innocence have died

00:01:34.486 --> 00:01:36.286
as they played their game.

00:01:39.515 --> 00:01:40.751
We will not sit idly by

00:01:42.627 --> 00:01:44.512
and allow our rights to be eroded

00:01:44.762 --> 00:01:46.882
out of fear and ignorance
any longer.

00:01:50.668 --> 00:01:53.221
We will not be herded into ghettos

00:01:53.471 --> 00:01:55.757
and treated as outcasts.
We will stop

00:01:56.007 --> 00:01:57.313
at nothing.

00:01:58.617 --> 00:02:00.195
The world is different now.

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.680
The old rules no longer apply.

00:02:11.354 --> 00:02:12.440
So much pain.

00:02:16.013 --> 00:02:17.163
So many lies.

00:02:22.022 --> 00:02:23.985
That darkness must end.

00:02:42.298 --> 00:02:45.473
This should be your fight
as well, brother.

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.617
The promise of a gold age is over.

00:03:15.529 --> 00:03:17.429
I won't let it happen again.
