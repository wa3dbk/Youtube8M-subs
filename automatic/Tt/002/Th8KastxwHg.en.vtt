the<00:01:35.939> next<00:01:36.210> step<00:01:36.360> is<00:01:36.540> to<00:01:36.810> clean<00:01:37.439> the<00:01:37.619> surface<00:01:38.040> of

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
the next step is to clean the surface of

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:41.149 
the next step is to clean the surface of
any<00:01:38.400> kind<00:01:38.820> of<00:01:38.990> contaminant<00:01:39.990> so<00:01:40.320> anything

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
any kind of contaminant so anything

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.780 
any kind of contaminant so anything
that's<00:01:41.340> had<00:01:41.700> some<00:01:42.240> kind<00:01:42.450> of<00:01:42.479> Teflon<00:01:42.990> or<00:01:43.020> polish

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:43.790 
that's had some kind of Teflon or polish

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:46.280 
that's had some kind of Teflon or polish
or<00:01:44.790> in<00:01:45.030> fact<00:01:45.240> the<00:01:45.329> glue<00:01:45.540> that's<00:01:45.720> been<00:01:45.930> holding

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
or in fact the glue that's been holding

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.050 
or in fact the glue that's been holding
the<00:01:46.409> little<00:01:46.530> vinyl<00:01:46.920> stripes<00:01:47.189> on<00:01:47.369> everything

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
the little vinyl stripes on everything

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.760 
the little vinyl stripes on everything
has<00:01:48.180> to<00:01:48.299> come<00:01:48.450> off<00:01:48.479> so<00:01:48.659> there's<00:01:48.930> a<00:01:48.990> nice<00:01:49.200> clean

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
has to come off so there's a nice clean

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.679 
has to come off so there's a nice clean
surface<00:01:50.100> that<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:50.640> vinyl<00:01:50.850> can<00:01:51.090> be<00:01:51.210> applied<00:01:51.479> to

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
surface that the vinyl can be applied to

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.870 
surface that the vinyl can be applied to
the<00:01:52.079> next<00:01:52.350> stage<00:01:52.560> is<00:01:52.979> to<00:01:53.040> prepare<00:01:53.549> for<00:01:53.610> the

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
the next stage is to prepare for the

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.060 
the next stage is to prepare for the
vinyl<00:01:54.299> which<00:01:54.899> involves<00:01:55.320> putting<00:01:55.380> a<00:01:55.799> little

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:56.070 
vinyl which involves putting a little

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.060 
vinyl which involves putting a little
vinyl<00:01:56.759> cutter<00:01:57.060> which<00:01:57.960> is<00:01:58.110> a<00:01:58.140> very<00:01:58.619> thin

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
vinyl cutter which is a very thin

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.429 
vinyl cutter which is a very thin
filament<00:01:59.700> of<00:01:59.850> Kevlar<00:02:00.270> which<00:02:01.079> Phil<00:02:01.350> is

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
filament of Kevlar which Phil is

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:03.950 
filament of Kevlar which Phil is
applying<00:02:01.829> here<00:02:02.159> so<00:02:02.880> that<00:02:03.030> you<00:02:03.119> can<00:02:03.270> wrap<00:02:03.479> over

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
applying here so that you can wrap over

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.450 
applying here so that you can wrap over
it<00:02:04.110> and<00:02:04.350> then<00:02:04.469> when<00:02:04.649> the<00:02:04.770> wrap<00:02:04.979> is<00:02:05.130> all<00:02:05.280> in

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
it and then when the wrap is all in

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:06.430 
it and then when the wrap is all in
place

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:06.440 
place

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.130 
place
simply<00:02:06.890> peel<00:02:07.250> back<00:02:07.580> the<00:02:07.790> filament<00:02:08.270> it'll<00:02:08.690> cut

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:09.140 
simply peel back the filament it'll cut

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.080 
simply peel back the filament it'll cut
the<00:02:09.170> wrap<00:02:09.530> like<00:02:09.770> a<00:02:09.830> cheese<00:02:10.160> wire<00:02:10.400> and<00:02:10.910> leave<00:02:11.060> a

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
the wrap like a cheese wire and leave a

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.530 
the wrap like a cheese wire and leave a
very<00:02:11.390> nice<00:02:11.660> clean<00:02:12.050> sharp<00:02:12.410> finish<00:02:13.390> along<00:02:14.390> this

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
very nice clean sharp finish along this

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.000 
very nice clean sharp finish along this
waterline<00:02:15.260> you<00:02:15.410> can<00:02:15.560> see<00:02:15.710> there's<00:02:15.860> a<00:02:15.890> little

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:16.010 
waterline you can see there's a little

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.220 
waterline you can see there's a little
bit<00:02:16.190> of<00:02:16.220> algae<00:02:16.820> staining<00:02:17.300> in<00:02:17.480> the<00:02:17.690> actual<00:02:18.020> gel

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
bit of algae staining in the actual gel

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.350 
bit of algae staining in the actual gel
coat<00:02:18.470> so<00:02:19.100> what<00:02:19.220> I've<00:02:19.340> done<00:02:19.490> it<00:02:19.670> is<00:02:19.880> applied

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
coat so what I've done it is applied

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.760 
coat so what I've done it is applied
some<00:02:20.870> white<00:02:21.320> n<00:02:21.680> gel<00:02:22.220> which<00:02:23.230> bleaches<00:02:24.230> out<00:02:24.410> the

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:24.770 
some white n gel which bleaches out the

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:26.920 
some white n gel which bleaches out the
brown<00:02:24.980> and<00:02:25.250> will<00:02:25.370> hopefully<00:02:25.550> make<00:02:26.390> sure<00:02:26.630> that

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:26.930 
brown and will hopefully make sure that

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:29.410 
brown and will hopefully make sure that
it<00:02:27.680> matches<00:02:27.950> up<00:02:28.310> with<00:02:28.550> where<00:02:28.730> this<00:02:28.880> stripe<00:02:29.180> has

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
it matches up with where this stripe has

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:30.850 
it matches up with where this stripe has
been<00:02:29.630> done<00:02:29.810> when<00:02:29.990> you<00:02:30.140> see<00:02:30.470> a<00:02:30.500> little<00:02:30.650> bit<00:02:30.800> of

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
been done when you see a little bit of

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:32.620 
been done when you see a little bit of
difference<00:02:31.220> between<00:02:31.310> the<00:02:31.580> colors<00:02:31.850> but<00:02:32.450> now

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630 
difference between the colors but now

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:35.200 
difference between the colors but now
I've<00:02:32.780> put<00:02:33.020> this<00:02:33.190> bleaching<00:02:34.190> effect<00:02:34.310> on<00:02:34.700> it

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:35.210 
I've put this bleaching effect on it

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:37.360 
I've put this bleaching effect on it
should<00:02:35.480> take<00:02:35.780> out<00:02:35.960> any<00:02:36.170> of<00:02:36.230> that<00:02:36.320> staining<00:02:36.860> and

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:37.370 
should take out any of that staining and

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:38.680 
should take out any of that staining and
make<00:02:37.550> sure<00:02:37.730> we<00:02:37.850> have<00:02:37.970> a<00:02:38.000> nice<00:02:38.150> clean<00:02:38.480> white

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
make sure we have a nice clean white

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.020 
make sure we have a nice clean white
line<00:02:38.960> this<00:02:39.860> is<00:02:39.920> the<00:02:40.040> vinyl<00:02:40.460> that<00:02:40.490> I've<00:02:40.790> chosen

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
line this is the vinyl that I've chosen

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:43.150 
line this is the vinyl that I've chosen
to<00:02:41.270> be<00:02:41.330> almost<00:02:41.650> played<00:02:42.650> by<00:02:42.770> a<00:02:42.800> company<00:02:43.100> called

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
to be almost played by a company called

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.120 
to be almost played by a company called
backpack<00:02:44.060> and<00:02:44.630> I've<00:02:45.320> gone<00:02:45.500> for<00:02:45.710> a<00:02:45.800> kind<00:02:46.070> of

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 
backpack and I've gone for a kind of

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:48.670 
backpack and I've gone for a kind of
silvery<00:02:46.700> grey<00:02:47.240> effect<00:02:47.600> which<00:02:48.410> is<00:02:48.560> all

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:48.680 
silvery grey effect which is all

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.830 
silvery grey effect which is all
currently<00:02:49.640> on<00:02:49.790> this<00:02:49.940> big<00:02:50.120> roll<00:02:50.330> they're<00:02:50.720> going

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
currently on this big roll they're going

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.600 
currently on this big roll they're going
to<00:02:50.900> unroll<00:02:51.200> it<00:02:51.260> and<00:02:51.620> then<00:02:51.830> start<00:02:52.130> to<00:02:52.310> apply<00:02:52.490> it

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
to unroll it and then start to apply it

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:54.790 
to unroll it and then start to apply it
to<00:02:52.940> the<00:02:53.300> top<00:02:53.480> size<00:02:53.750> of<00:02:53.930> the<00:02:54.020> boat<00:02:54.200> so<00:02:54.440> hopefully

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:54.800 
to the top size of the boat so hopefully

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.380 
to the top size of the boat so hopefully
when<00:02:54.950> it's<00:02:54.980> finished<00:02:55.370> it<00:02:55.970> will<00:02:56.000> have<00:02:56.180> a<00:02:56.210> nice

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:56.390 
when it's finished it will have a nice

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.480 
when it's finished it will have a nice
silvery<00:02:57.020> gray<00:02:57.260> almost<00:02:57.710> like<00:02:58.100> a<00:02:58.130> metallic

00:02:58.480 --> 00:02:58.490 
silvery gray almost like a metallic

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
silvery gray almost like a metallic
effect<00:03:00.280> so<00:03:01.280> now<00:03:01.430> the<00:03:01.490> guys<00:03:01.700> are<00:03:01.910> just<00:03:01.940> hanging

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:02.510 
effect so now the guys are just hanging

00:03:02.510 --> 00:03:04.810 
effect so now the guys are just hanging
the<00:03:02.750> vinyl<00:03:03.110> to<00:03:03.410> see<00:03:03.620> how<00:03:04.220> it's<00:03:04.430> going<00:03:04.610> to<00:03:04.670> fit

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:04.820 
the vinyl to see how it's going to fit

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:07.180 
the vinyl to see how it's going to fit
along<00:03:05.240> the<00:03:05.360> boat<00:03:05.540> just<00:03:06.110> temporarily<00:03:06.590> tack<00:03:07.070> it

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190 
along the boat just temporarily tack it

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:09.340 
along the boat just temporarily tack it
in<00:03:07.280> place<00:03:07.310> so<00:03:07.820> they<00:03:08.060> can<00:03:08.090> make<00:03:08.390> sure<00:03:08.570> they've

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:09.350 
in place so they can make sure they've

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:10.960 
in place so they can make sure they've
got<00:03:09.500> it<00:03:09.620> hanging<00:03:09.800> about<00:03:10.130> right<00:03:10.400> and<00:03:10.700> then

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
got it hanging about right and then

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:12.490 
got it hanging about right and then
they'll<00:03:11.150> proceed<00:03:11.300> to<00:03:11.630> the<00:03:11.720> actual<00:03:12.020> proper

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
they'll proceed to the actual proper

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.180 
they'll proceed to the actual proper
final<00:03:12.950> wrapping<00:03:13.250> stage<00:03:14.830> so<00:03:15.830> now<00:03:15.980> they've

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
final wrapping stage so now they've

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:17.949 
final wrapping stage so now they've
actually<00:03:16.310> started<00:03:16.790> to<00:03:16.910> apply<00:03:17.239> the<00:03:17.600> vinyl

00:03:17.949 --> 00:03:17.959 
actually started to apply the vinyl

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:20.890 
actually started to apply the vinyl
itself<00:03:18.230> once<00:03:19.220> the<00:03:19.400> backing<00:03:19.730> has<00:03:19.820> come<00:03:20.030> off<00:03:20.180> the

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900 
itself once the backing has come off the

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:22.930 
itself once the backing has come off the
adhesive<00:03:21.070> enables<00:03:22.070> it<00:03:22.190> to<00:03:22.220> slip<00:03:22.550> to<00:03:22.670> the<00:03:22.760> bone

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
adhesive enables it to slip to the bone

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:26.199 
adhesive enables it to slip to the bone
and<00:03:23.180> as<00:03:23.300> you<00:03:23.450> can<00:03:23.510> see<00:03:23.890> with<00:03:24.890> rapidly<00:03:25.580> smoothly

00:03:26.199 --> 00:03:26.209 
and as you can see with rapidly smoothly

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:28.630 
and as you can see with rapidly smoothly
now<00:03:26.480> taking<00:03:27.050> out<00:03:27.140> all<00:03:27.350> of<00:03:27.620> it<00:03:27.770> to<00:03:28.310> make<00:03:28.459> sure

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:28.640 
now taking out all of it to make sure

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.840 
now taking out all of it to make sure
it's<00:03:28.970> properly<00:03:29.300> adhered<00:03:29.900> to<00:03:30.080> the<00:03:30.200> surface

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:30.850 
it's properly adhered to the surface

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:33.610 
it's properly adhered to the surface
this<00:03:31.850> is<00:03:32.000> the<00:03:32.090> color<00:03:32.270> I've<00:03:32.450> gone<00:03:32.660> for<00:03:32.900> which<00:03:33.440> is

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620 
this is the color I've gone for which is

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:36.670 
this is the color I've gone for which is
a<00:03:33.650> glossy<00:03:34.220> silver<00:03:35.200> it's<00:03:36.200> relatively

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:36.680 
a glossy silver it's relatively

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.979 
a glossy silver it's relatively
conventional<00:03:37.550> and<00:03:37.970> much<00:03:38.150> like<00:03:38.390> a<00:03:38.420> glossy

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:38.989 
conventional and much like a glossy

00:03:46.449 --> 00:03:46.459 
shiny look and should mean that it's

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:48.520 
shiny look and should mean that it's
good<00:03:46.700> for<00:03:46.730> at<00:03:47.390> least<00:03:47.600> five<00:03:48.110> years<00:03:48.140> before

into that now the final stage in the
process<00:04:41.430> is<00:04:41.879> what's<00:04:42.089> called<00:04:42.300> a<00:04:42.449> post<00:04:42.809> heat<00:04:43.110> so

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:43.800 
process is what's called a post heat so

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.320 
process is what's called a post heat so
the<00:04:43.919> vinyl<00:04:44.099> is<00:04:44.339> now<00:04:44.490> being<00:04:44.669> applied<00:04:44.759> and

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
the vinyl is now being applied and

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:47.689 
the vinyl is now being applied and
wrapped<00:04:45.749> around<00:04:45.899> the<00:04:46.199> boat<00:04:46.379> but<00:04:47.039> it's<00:04:47.520> always

00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:47.699 
wrapped around the boat but it's always

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:49.399 
wrapped around the boat but it's always
trying<00:04:48.089> to<00:04:48.149> go<00:04:48.389> back<00:04:48.629> to<00:04:48.779> its<00:04:48.960> original<00:04:49.020> shape

00:04:49.399 --> 00:04:49.409 
trying to go back to its original shape

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:51.320 
trying to go back to its original shape
is<00:04:49.830> what<00:04:49.979> they<00:04:50.099> call<00:04:50.249> it<00:04:50.430> the<00:04:50.699> memory<00:04:50.939> of<00:04:51.180> the

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:51.330 
is what they call it the memory of the

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:53.149 
is what they call it the memory of the
vinyl<00:04:51.689> so<00:04:52.259> they<00:04:52.379> have<00:04:52.529> to<00:04:52.619> go<00:04:52.770> over<00:04:52.919> the<00:04:53.009> whole

00:04:53.149 --> 00:04:53.159 
vinyl so they have to go over the whole

00:04:53.159 --> 00:04:55.279 
vinyl so they have to go over the whole
thing<00:04:53.189> again<00:04:53.490> with<00:04:53.969> a<00:04:54.029> heat<00:04:54.270> gun<00:04:54.479> just<00:04:55.169> to

00:04:55.279 --> 00:04:55.289 
thing again with a heat gun just to

00:04:55.289 --> 00:04:57.589 
thing again with a heat gun just to
ensure<00:04:55.589> that<00:04:55.619> it<00:04:55.949> sets<00:04:56.399> the<00:04:56.669> vinyl<00:04:57.029> it<00:04:57.149> relaxes

00:04:57.589 --> 00:04:57.599 
ensure that it sets the vinyl it relaxes

00:04:57.599 --> 00:04:59.179 
ensure that it sets the vinyl it relaxes
it<00:04:57.719> and<00:04:57.869> then<00:04:57.990> steps<00:04:58.289> it<00:04:58.499> in<00:04:58.649> the<00:04:58.800> position

00:04:59.179 --> 00:04:59.189 
it and then steps it in the position

00:04:59.189 --> 00:05:01.129 
it and then steps it in the position
that<00:04:59.219> it's<00:04:59.430> been<00:04:59.580> applied<00:04:59.879> to<00:04:59.909> on<00:05:00.210> the<00:05:00.300> boat<00:05:00.479> so

00:05:01.129 --> 00:05:01.139 
that it's been applied to on the boat so

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:02.719 
that it's been applied to on the boat so
then<00:05:01.409> there's<00:05:01.619> no<00:05:01.770> danger<00:05:02.159> of<00:05:02.189> it<00:05:02.339> moving

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:02.729 
then there's no danger of it moving

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:04.730 
then there's no danger of it moving
under<00:05:02.969> the<00:05:03.089> heat<00:05:03.240> of<00:05:03.270> the<00:05:03.419> Sun<00:05:03.629> it's<00:05:04.110> locked<00:05:04.469> in

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:04.740 
under the heat of the Sun it's locked in

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:06.829 
under the heat of the Sun it's locked in
that<00:05:04.949> position<00:05:05.360> one<00:05:06.360> of<00:05:06.449> the<00:05:06.509> questions

00:05:06.829 --> 00:05:06.839 
that position one of the questions

00:05:06.839 --> 00:05:08.449 
that position one of the questions
people<00:05:06.930> ask<00:05:07.289> a<00:05:07.409> lot<00:05:07.439> is<00:05:07.709> what<00:05:07.860> happens<00:05:08.219> if<00:05:08.339> you

00:05:08.449 --> 00:05:08.459 
people ask a lot is what happens if you

00:05:08.459 --> 00:05:10.760 
people ask a lot is what happens if you
actually<00:05:08.610> scratch<00:05:09.240> the<00:05:09.479> boat<00:05:09.659> up<00:05:10.289> through<00:05:10.619> the

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:10.770 
actually scratch the boat up through the

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:13.159 
actually scratch the boat up through the
vinyl<00:05:10.979> itself<00:05:11.399> and<00:05:12.240> the<00:05:12.360> answer<00:05:12.629> is<00:05:12.749> you<00:05:12.990> just
