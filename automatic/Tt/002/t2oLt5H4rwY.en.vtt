00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
beautiful to look at and they're very

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.240 
beautiful to look at and they're very
selective<00:01:15.990> about<00:01:16.110> the<00:01:16.439> materials<00:01:16.979> that<00:01:17.040> they

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
selective about the materials that they

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.730 
selective about the materials that they
use<00:01:17.520> they<00:01:18.030> told<00:01:18.240> us<00:01:18.420> that<00:01:18.600> 90%<00:01:19.080> of<00:01:19.530> those

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
use they told us that 90% of those

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.160 
use they told us that 90% of those
blocks<00:01:20.130> get<00:01:20.460> thrown<00:01:20.729> out<00:01:21.030> for<00:01:21.450> imperfections

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:22.170 
blocks get thrown out for imperfections

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.380 
blocks get thrown out for imperfections
so<00:01:22.770> they're<00:01:22.920> very<00:01:23.189> picky<00:01:23.490> we<00:01:23.820> expect<00:01:24.240> that

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:24.390 
so they're very picky we expect that

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.080

millimeter lens again beautiful results
with<00:03:08.680> these<00:03:08.830> and<00:03:09.160> later<00:03:09.790> this<00:03:10.000> year<00:03:10.240> they'll

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
with these and later this year they'll

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:13.380 
with these and later this year they'll
also<00:03:10.720> be<00:03:11.050> a<00:03:11.200> telephoto<00:03:11.830> zoom<00:03:12.400> lens<00:03:12.430> and<00:03:12.940> the

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
also be a telephoto zoom lens and the

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:15.360 
also be a telephoto zoom lens and the
wide-angle<00:03:13.570> zoom<00:03:13.870> lens<00:03:14.260> so<00:03:14.530> you'll<00:03:14.890> have<00:03:15.040> four

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:15.370 
wide-angle zoom lens so you'll have four

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:16.620 
wide-angle zoom lens so you'll have four
options<00:03:15.850> right<00:03:16.090> away
