Arkansas

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:29.800

not<00:00:33.440> a<00:00:33.469> game

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:36.550 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.410 

very<00:00:37.410> interested<00:00:38.410> to<00:00:38.440> see<00:00:38.680> this

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:40.420 
very interested to see this

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:42.270 
very interested to see this
the<00:00:40.720> space

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:42.280 
the space

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.450 
the space
that<00:00:42.820> they<00:00:43.180> spent<00:00:43.690> billions<00:00:44.320> up<00:00:44.829> which<00:00:45.190> is<00:00:45.340> an

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:45.460 
that they spent billions up which is an

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:47.380 
that they spent billions up which is an
underground<00:00:45.879> city

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:47.390 
underground city

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.670 
underground city
that<00:00:47.809> they've<00:00:47.989> built<00:00:48.200> and<00:00:48.530> has<00:00:48.800> roadways

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:51.680 
that they've built and has roadways

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.000 
that they've built and has roadways
in<00:00:52.680> the<00:00:52.890> mountains<00:00:53.660> underground

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
in the mountains underground

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.220 
in the mountains underground
all<00:00:57.010> the<00:00:57.250> way<00:00:57.400> west<00:00:57.730> to<00:00:58.030> Colorado

00:00:59.220 --> 00:00:59.230 
all the way west to Colorado

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:02.860 
all the way west to Colorado
I<00:00:59.260> think<00:01:00.100> the<00:01:00.220> exit<00:01:00.550> is<00:01:00.700> Colorado<00:01:01.150> Airport

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:02.870 
I think the exit is Colorado Airport

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.800 
I think the exit is Colorado Airport
where<00:01:03.379> the<00:01:03.850> the<00:01:04.850> camps<00:01:05.180> are<00:01:05.269> located<00:01:05.330> out

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:05.810 
where the the camps are located out

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:06.609 
where the the camps are located out
there<00:01:06.020> as<00:01:06.110> well

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:06.619 
there as well

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:12.890 
there as well
and<00:01:07.299> all<00:01:08.299> the<00:01:08.510> way<00:01:08.600> to<00:01:08.630> Washington<00:01:08.900> DC

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.160 

where<00:01:13.440> I<00:01:13.470> think<00:01:13.740> there<00:01:14.070> might<00:01:14.190> be<00:01:14.250> a<00:01:14.460> passage

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:15.170 
where I think there might be a passage

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:19.960 
where I think there might be a passage
close<00:01:16.170> or<00:01:16.620> at<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:17.070> White<00:01:17.250> House

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
picked that area is their home base and

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.929 
picked that area is their home base and
they've<00:01:52.460> built<00:01:52.790> a

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:54.939 
they've built a

00:01:54.939 --> 00:01:57.059 
they've built a
command<00:01:55.329> center<00:01:55.719> which<00:01:56.229> looks<00:01:56.499> like<00:01:56.710> a<00:01:56.740> giant

00:01:57.059 --> 00:01:57.069 
command center which looks like a giant

00:01:57.069 --> 00:01:58.260 
command center which looks like a giant
it's<00:01:57.460> bigger<00:01:57.670> than<00:01:57.850> the<00:01:57.909> White<00:01:58.090> House

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:58.270 
it's bigger than the White House

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:59.830 
it's bigger than the White House
actually

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840 
actually

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.590 
actually
in<00:01:59.960> the<00:02:00.500> middle<00:02:00.740> of<00:02:00.829> this<00:02:00.920> town<00:02:01.310> I<00:02:01.729> don't<00:02:02.329> even

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:02.600 
in the middle of this town I don't even

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.270 
in the middle of this town I don't even
know<00:02:02.869> how<00:02:03.020> many<00:02:03.079> square<00:02:03.560> feet<00:02:03.829> it<00:02:03.950> is<00:02:04.100> I<00:02:04.220> think

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
know how many square feet it is I think

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.930 
know how many square feet it is I think
it's<00:02:04.520> like

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:06.940 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:09.180 

might<00:02:07.540> be<00:02:07.720> over<00:02:07.990> a<00:02:08.020> hundred<00:02:08.470> thousand<00:02:09.100> square

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
might be over a hundred thousand square

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.680 
might be over a hundred thousand square
feet<00:02:09.610> it's<00:02:09.940> bigger<00:02:10.180> than<00:02:10.330> the<00:02:10.420> White<00:02:10.540> House

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
feet it's bigger than the White House

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.550 
feet it's bigger than the White House
and<00:02:14.090> this<00:02:15.090> home<00:02:15.390> phase<00:02:15.720> had<00:02:16.080> actually

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:16.560 
and this home phase had actually

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.780 
and this home phase had actually
established<00:02:18.110> on<00:02:19.110> top<00:02:19.530> of<00:02:19.710> land<00:02:19.950> in<00:02:20.280> them<00:02:20.580> that

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
established on top of land in them that

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
the way to Washington DC but this again

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:38.570 
the way to Washington DC but this again
was<00:02:32.940> built<00:02:33.210> because<00:02:33.660> of<00:02:33.840> the

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.420 

the<00:02:39.000> research<00:02:39.420> that<00:02:39.450> was<00:02:39.780> done<00:02:40.020> has<00:02:40.920> the<00:02:41.250> most

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
the research that was done has the most

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.170 
the research that was done has the most
likely<00:02:41.790> place<00:02:42.330> to<00:02:42.660> survive<00:02:43.410> a<00:02:44.180> cataclysmic

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:45.180 
likely place to survive a cataclysmic

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:50.650 
likely place to survive a cataclysmic
event<00:02:46.370> so<00:02:48.290> I'm<00:02:49.290> gonna<00:02:49.440> go<00:02:49.590> check<00:02:49.860> this<00:02:50.070> out<00:02:50.340> and
