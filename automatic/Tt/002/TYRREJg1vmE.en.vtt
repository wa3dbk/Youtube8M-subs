 pokemones 9 the movement more powers of 

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:40.060
 dragon type and bng and that's what that teaches 

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:42.100
 something from your pokemon and we give it to you so 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:45.340
 we can you want the garment and my 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:48.940
 elements and look cry have already learned 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:50.470
 and then for example the pokemon that 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:52.720
 it must be a Pokémon that 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:55.300
 have quite a dragon type level 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:56.890
 flying or dragon alone and having 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:59.440
 pretty friendship with you let's what 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:01.210
 trained you had had such a high level 

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:02.980
 For example, if this one turns like 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.180
 I recently I'm sure 

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:09.310
 say no 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:13.520
 see if this idea with yes can then 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:16.450
 look if I have a pokemon that I do not have 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.450
 pretty friendship with me 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:25.200
 like the elements that we put on 

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:27.290
 I just got not recently 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:29.060
 arceo know 

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:30.079
 look sorry, your pokemon can not 

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:31.879
 learn that moment because they had you 

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:33.829
 been sufficiently bound to you a 

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:35.810
 report that you can follow it then 

00:02:33.829 --> 00:02:37.250
 so you can learn this movement 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.540
 any little dragon type has 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.000
 have to be fairly level and have 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.379
 pretty friendship with you is to say that 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.140

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:46.790
