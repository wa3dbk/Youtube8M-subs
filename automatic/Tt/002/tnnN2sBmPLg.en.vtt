this<00:00:37.579> may<00:00:37.790> see<00:00:37.850> at<00:00:38.120> least<00:00:38.239> I<00:00:38.719> don't<00:00:39.499> need<00:00:39.620> to

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:39.800 
this may see at least I don't need to

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:41.319

have<00:00:40.100> them<00:00:40.219> completely<00:00:40.670> functional<00:00:40.879> but<00:00:41.239> it'd

00:00:41.319 --> 00:00:41.329 
have them completely functional but it'd

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:42.700 
have them completely functional but it'd
be<00:00:41.359> nice<00:00:41.539> to<00:00:41.809> have<00:00:41.989> something<00:00:42.230> that<00:00:42.350> could<00:00:42.559> sit

take<00:00:55.969> a<00:00:55.999> little<00:00:56.359> chunk<00:00:56.629> of<00:00:56.690> that<00:00:56.749> and<00:00:57.050> then<00:00:57.319> he

00:00:58.169 --> 00:00:58.179 
take a little chunk of that and then he

00:00:58.179 --> 00:01:02.169 
take a little chunk of that and then he
didn't<00:00:59.179> your<00:00:59.390> dremel<00:00:59.859> you<00:01:00.859> can<00:01:01.010> use<00:01:01.249> yet<00:01:02.030> to

00:01:02.169 --> 00:01:02.179 
didn't your dremel you can use yet to

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:19.230 
get to work with the filament it'll fit

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:21.740 
get to work with the filament it'll fit
it's<00:01:19.380> a<00:01:19.440> little<00:01:19.650> snug<00:01:19.860> but<00:01:19.920> it<00:01:20.610> works<00:01:20.850> and<00:01:21.720> I

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
it's a little snug but it works and I

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.150 
it's a little snug but it works and I
don't<00:01:21.810> even<00:01:22.020> taking<00:01:22.380> it<00:01:22.440> down<00:01:22.590> very<00:01:22.800> far<00:01:23.130> I

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:23.160 
don't even taking it down very far I

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.670 
don't even taking it down very far I
just<00:01:23.280> do<00:01:23.760> a<00:01:23.790> hand<00:01:24.120> tight<00:01:24.410> there's<00:01:25.410> a<00:01:25.440> little

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
just do a hand tight there's a little

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:37.310 
just do a hand tight there's a little
finger<00:01:25.890> tight<00:01:26.100> acts<00:01:26.460> on<00:01:26.729> that

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:54.969

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:57.469 

if<00:01:55.979> I<00:01:56.070> go<00:01:56.220> too<00:01:56.280> long<00:01:56.549> with<00:01:56.759> that<00:01:56.909> tip<00:01:57.180> and<00:01:57.210> it

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
if I go too long with that tip and it

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.560 
if I go too long with that tip and it
gets<00:01:57.630> too<00:01:57.899> too<00:01:58.860> short<00:01:59.310> I<00:01:59.549> can't<00:02:00.000> grab<00:02:00.270> with<00:02:00.450> the

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
gets too too short I can't grab with the

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:02.770 
gets too too short I can't grab with the
player<00:02:00.780> then<00:02:00.990> pull<00:02:01.619> it<00:02:01.740> out<00:02:01.799> a<00:02:01.860> little<00:02:02.039> bit<00:02:02.220> so

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:02.780 
player then pull it out a little bit so

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.450 
player then pull it out a little bit so
pull<00:02:03.780> it<00:02:03.810> out<00:02:03.990> and<00:02:04.140> get<00:02:04.350> it<00:02:04.470> back<00:02:04.680> in<00:02:04.920> not<00:02:05.310> too

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
pull it out and get it back in not too

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.999 
pull it out and get it back in not too
far<00:02:05.700> out<00:02:05.729> if<00:02:05.909> I<00:02:06.000> put<00:02:06.180> it<00:02:06.270> in<00:02:06.329> too<00:02:07.289> far<00:02:07.500> out<00:02:07.680> it

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
far out if I put it in too far out it

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.600 
far out if I put it in too far out it
kind<00:02:08.280> of<00:02:08.310> whoops<00:02:08.610> around<00:02:09.000> and<00:02:09.470> then<00:02:10.610> breaks

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
kind of whoops around and then breaks

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.400 
kind of whoops around and then breaks
off<00:02:11.819> think<00:02:12.750> I<00:02:12.810> might<00:02:12.959> have<00:02:13.019> been<00:02:13.110> going<00:02:13.260> a

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
off think I might have been going a

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
that's certainly not going to fall off

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.380
