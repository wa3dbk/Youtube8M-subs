00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:19.990
 hello today i will you 

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:22.419
 explain how to solve your problems 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:23.919
 flush water flows into the 

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:24.849
 bowl of your toilet and reserving it 

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:27.130
 can not fill 

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:29.110
 two possibilities a faucet problem 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:30.460
 floats or a bell problem and the 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:31.900
 water release system you go 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.670
 open the tank lid 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:35.080
 if the water escapes through the well of the 

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:37.750
 overflow you know that the faucet 

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:40.330
 floats malfunctions the mechanism 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:42.489
 is surely blocked by the ugtt tried 

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:44.830
 to maneuver to unlock it without 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:46.150
 force the pieces are fragile if he is 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:48.820
 really stuck 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:50.379
 Both solutions change the egg or 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.269
 to disassemble and let it soak in 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:52.629
 a descaling liquid other case of 

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:54.780
 figure 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:56.949
 the water flows through the completion valve 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.210
 Perhaps this is just the TÃ¢tre 

00:00:56.949 --> 00:00:59.589
 which prevents sealing 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.330
 you will empty into your tank 

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:03.600
 after closing the water and pull the 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:05.740
 hunting liters of distilled vinegar 

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.210
 press the bell with your hand 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:07.600
 so that the vinegar does not leak into the 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.140
 bowl 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.369
 it's a bit long an hour in the end a 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.799
 small brush stroke to evacuate 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:16.990
 waste later prometheus the water and shoot the 

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:18.130
 hunting if the water flows outside and 

00:01:16.990 --> 00:01:19.719
 inside the bowl 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.310
 the laments the hymn of the bell and 

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:23.380
 maybe loosen or seal to 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.210
 change in both cases you go 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.350
 have to dismount the hunt not for 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.789
 disassemble the tank you will need 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.609
 two keys for misses and the arrival 

00:01:27.789 --> 00:01:31.840
 of water I close the tap and pull the 

00:01:30.609 --> 00:01:32.859
 hunt 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:34.200
 I'm careful of a patton the 

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:37.240
 piping when I use them the wave 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.859
 hence the two miss countries and the two 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.869
 butterfly nuts and there you can 

00:01:38.859 --> 00:01:42.219
 raised the tank first 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:43.240
 checks 

00:01:42.219 --> 00:01:45.609
 the big ring the joints and there 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:48.009
 insert no then with the key of your 

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:49.869
 flush a pliers manifold tighten the 

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:50.350
 check the seal between the tank and 

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:53.890
 the bowl 

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:55.630
 if it is damaged change the reinstall the 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.109
 everything is tight well if you still have 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:57.999
 leaks 

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:59.439
 better to change the whole mechanism 

00:01:57.999 --> 00:02:00.609
 the toilet flush 

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:02.799
 you will be quiet for many 

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:05.139
 years you will find on our site 

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:06.939
 internet a video on this subject here is 

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:07.899
 I hope you have been useful for 

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:09.280
