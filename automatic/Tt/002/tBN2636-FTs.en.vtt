00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:05.810
 hello friends stay jorge of faith steal 

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:08.059
 I want to show them this pan you 

00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:11.450
 to use it in our kitchens in 

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:13.370
 our camping gas stoves is 

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:14.900
 from the manufacturer of gs and others we have it 

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:17.480
 in two days I three different this one 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:19.460
 it would be 20 centimeters this would be 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.619
 Largest diameter of about 25 centimeters 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:24.730
 is approximately will have a weight of 1 

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:27.050
 500 grams of this about 374 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:29.480
 main characteristics one like 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:31.490
 you can see and appreciate here is the handle is 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.770
 completely foldable so that at the time 

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:36.579
 to transport it we are less occupied 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:36.579
 space 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:45.320
 of larger size, the same 

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:47.240
 features that technology variant 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.430
 of the g-6 has evolved this pans 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:52.610
 with the new pinnacle technology that is 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:54.620
 a Teflon-based surface 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:57.050
 by multilayer so that there is a better 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:59.989
 heat distribution distribution no 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:02.330
 let's say mega hot spots and according to 

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:05.810
 he says he is more resistant and more 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:07.820
 durable than stainless steel in 

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.650
 the bottom part you can see what it is 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:10.820
 fully slotted is a 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.160
 characteristic that I like because 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.740
 at the time of placing it for example this 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:18.979
 kind of children others who are from 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:21.830
 legs will not have a better one better 

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:22.970
 support and stability perfectly as 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.610
 I have commented to use it in our 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:27.619
 gas stove the criminal system that 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:30.200
 that will give us is a savings in the 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:32.330
 consumption of our fuel since a 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.520
 the time to warm up better and more 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:36.410
 evenly we are going to do it more 

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.170
 quickly with what we are going to reduce 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:40.369
 the consumption of gas or fuel in 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.280
 this case for example if we are going to 

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:45.369
 use 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.720
 of gasoline or paraffin also 

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:49.090
 same features totally 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:51.400
 regulated and as you can appreciate the 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.290
 previous ones so that they occupy very little 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:55.810
 space you can see here the part 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:58.430
 completely interior 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.590
 resistant I hope this information 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:01.970
 has helped us and if it has 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.620
 liked the video but you share it 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.910
 in your social networks and you give 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:06.910
 I like greetings
