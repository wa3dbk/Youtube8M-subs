do because what happens is this thing is

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.210 
do because what happens is this thing is
going<00:01:08.580> to<00:01:09.200> rearrange<00:01:10.200> the<00:01:10.799> financial

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
going to rearrange the financial

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.679 
going to rearrange the financial
structure<00:01:11.520> so<00:01:11.820> much<00:01:12.090> that<00:01:12.299> I<00:01:12.330> think<00:01:12.600> the

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
structure so much that I think the

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:14.480 
structure so much that I think the
notional<00:01:13.080> value<00:01:13.140> of<00:01:13.590> your<00:01:13.770> assets<00:01:14.189> will<00:01:14.340> be

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
notional value of your assets will be

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:15.890 
notional value of your assets will be
much<00:01:14.729> much<00:01:14.909> higher<00:01:15.150> when<00:01:15.420> this<00:01:15.570> thing<00:01:15.780> gets

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
much much higher when this thing gets

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.300 
much much higher when this thing gets
through<00:01:16.200> I<00:01:16.409> think<00:01:16.710> it's<00:01:16.890> going<00:01:17.009> to<00:01:17.040> happen<00:01:17.189> a

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:17.310 
through I think it's going to happen a

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.039 
through I think it's going to happen a
lot<00:01:17.340> faster<00:01:17.460> than<00:01:17.880> we<00:01:18.090> think<00:01:18.299> I<00:01:18.600> think<00:01:18.930> we're

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:19.049 
lot faster than we think I think we're

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.050 
lot faster than we think I think we're
gonna<00:01:19.140> have<00:01:19.380> spectacular<00:01:20.060> unprecedented

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
gonna have spectacular unprecedented

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.219 
gonna have spectacular unprecedented
breakthroughs<00:01:21.540> and<00:01:21.720> what<00:01:21.900> the<00:01:22.049> average

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
breakthroughs and what the average

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:25.070 
breakthroughs and what the average
person<00:01:22.500> knows<00:01:23.130> much<00:01:24.000> akin<00:01:24.330> to<00:01:24.390> when<00:01:24.720> the<00:01:24.869> Cosa

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.420 
is so spectacular and so positive that
your<00:01:45.810> cynicism<00:01:46.350> probably<00:01:46.920> won't<00:01:47.100> allow<00:01:47.369> you

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
your cynicism probably won't allow you

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.460 
your cynicism probably won't allow you
to<00:01:47.700> really<00:01:47.909> take<00:01:48.149> it<00:01:48.329> in<00:01:48.450> but<00:01:48.720> trust<00:01:49.020> me<00:01:49.140> and

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470 
to really take it in but trust me and

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.289 
to really take it in but trust me and
Trust<00:01:50.250> the<00:01:50.369> data<00:01:50.579> that<00:01:50.729> we're<00:01:50.909> starting<00:01:51.090> to

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
Trust the data that we're starting to

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:53.810 
Trust the data that we're starting to
see<00:01:51.329> it<00:01:52.079> is<00:01:52.259> at<00:01:52.380> least<00:01:52.560> possible<00:01:52.979> if<00:01:53.579> not

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
see it is at least possible if not

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:55.249 
see it is at least possible if not
probable<00:01:54.390> that<00:01:54.420> that<00:01:54.659> is<00:01:54.780> what's<00:01:54.960> going<00:01:55.110> to<00:01:55.200> be

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
probable that that is what's going to be

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:00.679 
probable that that is what's going to be
happening

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689
