this week somebody asked me to talk

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.089 
this week somebody asked me to talk
about<00:00:06.629> what<00:00:07.259> medical<00:00:07.529> school<00:00:07.710> is<00:00:07.799> actually

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
about what medical school is actually

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:10.220 
about what medical school is actually
like<00:00:08.280> so<00:00:08.730> let's<00:00:08.880> do<00:00:08.940> that<00:00:09.090> now<00:00:09.690> I<00:00:09.719> can<00:00:09.840> only<00:00:10.050> go

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230 
like so let's do that now I can only go

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:11.690 
like so let's do that now I can only go
by<00:00:10.410> my<00:00:10.590> own<00:00:10.740> experience<00:00:11.309> and<00:00:11.490> there<00:00:11.610> will

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
by my own experience and there will

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.009 
by my own experience and there will
definitely<00:00:11.849> be<00:00:12.120> some<00:00:12.210> variation<00:00:12.870> between

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:13.019 
definitely be some variation between

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:15.650 
definitely be some variation between
medical<00:00:13.500> schools<00:00:13.740> in<00:00:13.860> the<00:00:13.950> UK<00:00:14.130> but<00:00:14.880> the<00:00:15.330> basic

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660 
medical schools in the UK but the basic

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:16.939 
medical schools in the UK but the basic
gist<00:00:15.839> of<00:00:16.020> it<00:00:16.080> is<00:00:16.139> you'll<00:00:16.470> course<00:00:16.740> will<00:00:16.859> be

00:00:16.939 --> 00:00:16.949 
gist of it is you'll course will be

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:18.920 
gist of it is you'll course will be
split<00:00:17.220> up<00:00:17.250> into<00:00:17.520> a<00:00:17.640> pre<00:00:17.940> clinical<00:00:18.119> part<00:00:18.510> and<00:00:18.690> a

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
split up into a pre clinical part and a

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.720 
split up into a pre clinical part and a
clinical<00:00:19.289> part<00:00:19.560> a<00:00:19.740> pre<00:00:20.130> clinical<00:00:20.310> part<00:00:20.640> is

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
clinical part a pre clinical part is

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.040 
clinical part a pre clinical part is
normally<00:00:21.060> the<00:00:21.150> first<00:00:21.300> two<00:00:21.600> years

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
normally the first two years

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:23.720 
normally the first two years
well<00:00:22.410> the<00:00:22.800> clinical<00:00:23.130> part<00:00:23.220> is<00:00:23.340> normally<00:00:23.640> the

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
well the clinical part is normally the

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:25.970 
well the clinical part is normally the
last<00:00:23.910> three<00:00:24.240> in<00:00:24.750> between<00:00:25.140> -<00:00:25.320> you<00:00:25.470> may<00:00:25.590> also<00:00:25.740> do

your clinical years are a little bit
different<00:01:08.880> my<00:01:09.180> expect<00:01:09.570> this<00:01:09.720> is<00:01:09.870> the<00:01:09.960> part

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
different my expect this is the part

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.359 
different my expect this is the part
that<00:01:10.229> most<00:01:10.500> of<00:01:10.680> you<00:01:10.770> are<00:01:10.890> curious<00:01:11.130> about

that most of you are curious about
though<00:01:12.090> you<00:01:12.150> still<00:01:12.390> have<00:01:12.479> the<00:01:12.570> occasional

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080

though you still have the occasional
lecture<00:01:13.500> and<00:01:13.680> a<00:01:13.770> lot<00:01:13.979> of<00:01:14.010> teaching<00:01:14.580> you<00:01:14.880> spent

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
lecture and a lot of teaching you spent
