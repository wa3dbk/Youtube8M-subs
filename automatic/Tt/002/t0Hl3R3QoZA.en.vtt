thirty-five<00:00:02.429> years<00:00:02.790> worth<00:00:03.030> of<00:00:03.270> studying

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:03.650 
thirty-five years worth of studying

00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:05.869 
thirty-five years worth of studying
networks<00:00:04.650> in<00:00:04.859> the<00:00:04.890> brain<00:00:04.980> and<00:00:05.190> we<00:00:05.400> really<00:00:05.700> want

00:00:05.869 --> 00:00:05.879 
networks in the brain and we really want

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:07.130 
networks in the brain and we really want
to<00:00:05.970> understand<00:00:06.420> what<00:00:06.660> those<00:00:06.810> patterns

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:07.140 
to understand what those patterns

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.640 
to understand what those patterns
actually<00:00:07.710> mean<00:00:08.010> and<00:00:09.170> how<00:00:10.170> the<00:00:10.230> brain<00:00:10.590> is

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
actually mean and how the brain is

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:13.400 
actually mean and how the brain is
actually<00:00:11.250> functioning<00:00:12.090> so<00:00:12.360> this<00:00:12.570> really<00:00:13.049> led

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
actually functioning so this really led

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.039 
actually functioning so this really led
in<00:00:13.620> the<00:00:13.710> last<00:00:13.950> ten<00:00:14.250> years<00:00:14.280> to<00:00:15.179> thinking<00:00:15.809> about

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
in the last ten years to thinking about

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:17.269 
in the last ten years to thinking about
how<00:00:16.289> we<00:00:16.350> could<00:00:16.650> use<00:00:16.859> modern<00:00:17.250> technology

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
how we could use modern technology

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.120 
how we could use modern technology
especially<00:00:18.150> in<00:00:18.510> computer<00:00:18.960> science<00:00:19.380> to

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
especially in computer science to

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:21.800 
especially in computer science to
understand<00:00:20.760> the<00:00:20.939> organization<00:00:21.630> of<00:00:21.689> the<00:00:21.750> brain

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
understand the organization of the brain

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.109 
understand the organization of the brain
better<00:00:22.350> we<00:00:22.920> have<00:00:23.010> a<00:00:23.039> big<00:00:23.250> advantage<00:00:23.369> because

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
better we have a big advantage because

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.750 
better we have a big advantage because
we<00:00:24.510> were<00:00:25.289> the<00:00:25.410> only<00:00:25.439> group<00:00:25.769> really<00:00:26.519> in<00:00:26.640> the

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:26.760 
we were the only group really in the

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.109 
we were the only group really in the
world<00:00:26.970> that<00:00:27.240> has<00:00:27.420> a<00:00:27.449> flat<00:00:28.080> map<00:00:28.349> of<00:00:28.970> the<00:00:29.970> brain

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
world that has a flat map of the brain

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:32.959 
world that has a flat map of the brain
you<00:00:30.750> have<00:00:30.990> this<00:00:31.529> very<00:00:32.009> good<00:00:32.219> anatomical<00:00:32.790> map

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
you have this very good anatomical map

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.030 
you have this very good anatomical map
in<00:00:33.600> this<00:00:33.809> very<00:00:33.989> powerful<00:00:34.170> database<00:00:34.590> but

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.040 
in this very powerful database but

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.319 
in this very powerful database but
there's<00:00:35.190> no<00:00:35.280> communication<00:00:35.640> between<00:00:35.880> the<00:00:36.180> two

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
there's no communication between the two

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.209 
there's no communication between the two
databases<00:00:36.809> contains<00:00:37.739> all<00:00:37.890> this<00:00:38.010> information

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
databases contains all this information

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:39.920 
databases contains all this information
is<00:00:38.579> very<00:00:38.700> helpful<00:00:39.090> to<00:00:39.120> scientists<00:00:39.660> it's

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
is very helpful to scientists it's

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.630 
is very helpful to scientists it's
difficult<00:00:40.350> to<00:00:40.469> access<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:41.100> map<00:00:41.280> is<00:00:41.399> a<00:00:41.460> very

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
difficult to access the map is a very

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.459 
difficult to access the map is a very
useful<00:00:41.790> explanatory<00:00:42.540> tool<00:00:42.809> but<00:00:43.200> it<00:00:43.290> needs

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
useful explanatory tool but it needs

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:45.260 
useful explanatory tool but it needs
things<00:00:43.710> layered<00:00:43.980> on<00:00:44.129> top<00:00:44.160> of<00:00:44.460> it<00:00:44.550> and<00:00:44.760> I<00:00:45.210> took

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:45.270 
things layered on top of it and I took

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.459 
things layered on top of it and I took
this<00:00:45.480> as<00:00:45.629> an<00:00:45.719> opportunity<00:00:45.930> to<00:00:46.260> build

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
this as an opportunity to build

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.229 
this as an opportunity to build
something<00:00:46.710> like<00:00:47.070> a<00:00:47.100> google<00:00:47.700> maps<00:00:47.910> for<00:00:48.180> the

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
something like a google maps for the

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.240 
something like a google maps for the
brain<00:00:48.450> that<00:00:48.690> would<00:00:48.840> take<00:00:49.079> this<00:00:49.320> map<00:00:49.620> in<00:00:49.829> this

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
brain that would take this map in this

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.430 
brain that would take this map in this
data<00:00:50.460> and<00:00:50.550> connect<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.149> two<00:00:51.329> we're<00:00:52.140> drawing

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
data and connect the two we're drawing

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.250 
data and connect the two we're drawing

the map and we can add this to the map

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.190 
the map and we can add this to the map
down<00:01:35.759> and<00:01:36.000> this<00:01:36.299> is<00:01:36.420> where<00:01:36.600> the<00:01:36.689> dopamine<00:01:37.049> is

disease<00:01:41.520> but<00:01:42.090> if<00:01:42.180> I<00:01:42.240> want<00:01:42.390> to<00:01:42.450> know<00:01:42.540> what<00:01:42.810> that

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
disease but if I want to know what that

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.539 
disease but if I want to know what that
region<00:01:43.380> is<00:01:43.439> connecting<00:01:43.920> to<00:01:44.070> and<00:01:44.220> how<00:01:44.340> that's

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
region is connecting to and how that's

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.460 
region is connecting to and how that's
operating<00:01:45.299> in<00:01:45.390> a<00:01:45.450> more<00:01:45.600> complex<00:01:46.020> network

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
operating in a more complex network

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.260 
operating in a more complex network
that's<00:01:46.649> generating<00:01:47.100> behavior<00:01:47.549> that<00:01:47.880> data<00:01:48.149> is

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
that's generating behavior that data is

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.789 
that's generating behavior that data is
already<00:01:48.450> at<00:01:48.810> my<00:01:48.899> fingertips<00:01:49.170> are<00:01:49.320> really<00:01:49.649> easy

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
already at my fingertips are really easy

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.850 
already at my fingertips are really easy
to<00:01:50.009> use<00:01:50.040> so<00:01:50.610> i<00:01:50.670> click<00:01:50.939> on<00:01:51.090> it<00:01:51.240> and<00:01:51.560> add<00:01:52.560> this

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
to use so i click on it and add this

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.859 
to use so i click on it and add this
data<00:01:53.070> to<00:01:53.220> the<00:01:53.250> map<00:01:53.460> i<00:01:53.759> could<00:01:54.390> find<00:01:54.570> some<00:01:54.750> of<00:01:54.810> the

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
data to the map i could find some of the

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:56.660 
data to the map i could find some of the
connections<00:01:55.049> between<00:01:55.320> the<00:01:55.590> parts<00:01:55.950> some

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
connections between the parts some

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.459 
connections between the parts some
molecules<00:01:57.180> i<00:01:57.270> can<00:01:57.420> find<00:01:57.630> in<00:01:57.719> this<00:01:57.780> region<00:01:57.990> like

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
molecules i can find in this region like

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:00.499 
molecules i can find in this region like
dopamine<00:01:58.850> different<00:01:59.850> cell<00:02:00.030> types<00:02:00.240> that<00:02:00.329> might

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
dopamine different cell types that might

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.209 
dopamine different cell types that might
be<00:02:00.659> there<00:02:00.869> or<00:02:01.290> some<00:02:01.500> references<00:02:01.920> that<00:02:02.100> this

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
be there or some references that this

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:03.499 
be there or some references that this
data<00:02:02.399> came<00:02:02.670> from<00:02:02.700> so<00:02:03.090> I<00:02:03.119> could<00:02:03.270> do<00:02:03.360> some

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
data came from so I could do some

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.330 
data came from so I could do some
exploration<00:02:03.750> myself<00:02:04.590> of<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:04.829> original<00:02:05.159> data

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
exploration myself of the original data

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:06.980 
exploration myself of the original data
and<00:02:05.640> say<00:02:05.969> okay<00:02:06.210> well<00:02:06.420> what<00:02:06.659> are<00:02:06.750> some<00:02:06.869> of<00:02:06.960> the

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
and say okay well what are some of the

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.930 
and say okay well what are some of the
outputs<00:02:07.380> and<00:02:07.560> we<00:02:07.710> have<00:02:07.799> an<00:02:07.890> output<00:02:08.190> up<00:02:08.369> to<00:02:08.610> this

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
outputs and we have an output up to this

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:09.979 
outputs and we have an output up to this
region<00:02:09.149> that's<00:02:09.360> involved<00:02:09.660> in<00:02:09.810> controlling

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
region that's involved in controlling

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:12.860 
region that's involved in controlling
our<00:02:10.619> behavior<00:02:10.739> and<00:02:11.160> things<00:02:11.940> walking<00:02:12.540> and<00:02:12.780> I

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
our behavior and things walking and I

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.010 
our behavior and things walking and I
trace<00:02:13.319> this<00:02:13.440> connection

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020 
trace this connection

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:15.600 
trace this connection
and<00:02:14.320> it'd<00:02:14.410> be<00:02:14.500> interesting<00:02:14.620> then<00:02:15.010> to<00:02:15.130> find<00:02:15.370> out

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
and it'd be interesting then to find out

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.000 
and it'd be interesting then to find out
what<00:02:16.540> parts<00:02:16.720> that<00:02:17.020> part<00:02:17.260> connects<00:02:17.500> to<00:02:17.680> and<00:02:17.860> how

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.010 
what parts that part connects to and how

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:19.680 
what parts that part connects to and how
that<00:02:18.070> would<00:02:18.340> form<00:02:18.640> a<00:02:18.820> larger<00:02:19.180> circuit<00:02:19.570> that

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:19.690 
that would form a larger circuit that

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:21.810 
that would form a larger circuit that
would<00:02:19.780> influence<00:02:19.990> how<00:02:20.260> I<00:02:20.290> behave<00:02:20.620> and<00:02:20.950> so<00:02:21.700> we

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:21.820 
would influence how I behave and so we

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:25.800 
would influence how I behave and so we
can<00:02:21.970> use<00:02:22.240> this<00:02:22.710> Geographic<00:02:23.710> flat<00:02:24.490> map<00:02:24.820> of<00:02:25.180> the

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
can use this Geographic flat map of the

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:30.720 
can use this Geographic flat map of the
brain<00:02:25.960> as<00:02:27.060> really<00:02:28.060> a<00:02:28.300> way<00:02:29.110> to<00:02:29.170> show<00:02:29.920> the<00:02:29.950> basic

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
brain as really a way to show the basic

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.170 
brain as really a way to show the basic
highways<00:02:31.690> the<00:02:32.620> basic<00:02:33.010> cities<00:02:33.340> the<00:02:33.760> basic

geography<00:02:34.810> of<00:02:35.380> the<00:02:35.710> brain<00:02:35.950> the<00:02:36.610> reason<00:02:37.060> this

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
geography of the brain the reason this

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.300 
geography of the brain the reason this
project<00:02:37.810> is<00:02:37.930> so<00:02:38.140> important<00:02:38.710> is<00:02:38.830> because<00:02:38.890> the

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 
project is so important is because the

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.390 
project is so important is because the
brain<00:02:39.550> is<00:02:39.580> so<00:02:39.910> important<00:02:40.420> there<00:02:41.050> are<00:02:41.320> over<00:02:42.130> a

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
brain is so important there are over a

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.490 
brain is so important there are over a
thousand<00:02:43.030> diseases<00:02:43.570> that<00:02:43.840> involve<00:02:44.200> the

stroke<00:02:49.710> we<00:02:50.710> have<00:02:50.950> essentially<00:02:51.910> been<00:02:52.060> at<00:02:52.420> a

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
stroke we have essentially been at a

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.660 
stroke we have essentially been at a
standstill<00:02:52.870> thinking<00:02:53.770> about<00:02:54.010> how<00:02:54.190> to<00:02:54.250> create

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670

00:02:59.760 --> 00:02:59.770 
diseases and many many people now think

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:02.280 
diseases and many many people now think
that<00:03:00.750> understanding<00:03:01.750> these<00:03:01.870> neurological

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
that understanding these neurological

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.130 
that understanding these neurological
diseases<00:03:03.010> is<00:03:03.640> going<00:03:03.850> to<00:03:03.910> require
