 hi, sorry if you do n't see them but 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:12.300
 that's okay for now they want 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.969
 give you a short tutorial if I can 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:17.369
 do it because it costs evening 

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.500
 the audio doesn't work so well for me 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:23.369
 how to connect the new headphones of the 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:25.590
 sony has the classic TV at home in 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.090
 wireless mode 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.090
 so do not connect directly to 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.189
 headphone jack from three and a half 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.040
 paolo you just run what you need 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:38.100
 inside the headphone box 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:41.670
 obviously the headphones of course 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:44.370
 usb flash drive and three e 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:51.149
 amid increasingly supplied 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:53.129
 then I think 70 and 80 percent 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.850
 of the skilled people these xbox central 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:59.309
 that close to the main TV house 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:01.890
 so I didn't have it 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.470
 moment those given my game by three 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:08.460
 and half to the monitor I have of mine 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:16.790
 computer then the thing you have to do 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:22.049
 other than to connect this neighbor 

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:28.890

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:30.450
 world entry connect on one 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.140

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.140
 playstation 3 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:46.140
 turn on the headphones and they are turned on 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:49.229
 as you see from and in this case 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.470
 using independent and non-independent input 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:54.240
