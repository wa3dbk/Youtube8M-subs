black screen problem with the EPC 900 or
other<00:00:08.730> EE<00:00:09.090> pcs<00:00:11.150> just<00:00:12.150> do<00:00:12.300> the<00:00:12.450> following<00:00:12.809> I

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
other EE pcs just do the following I

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.810 
other EE pcs just do the following I
tried<00:00:13.769> to<00:00:14.610> reset<00:00:15.599> it<00:00:16.010> with<00:00:17.010> the<00:00:17.400> power<00:00:17.609> button

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
tried to reset it with the power button

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.189 
tried to reset it with the power button
but<00:00:18.180> unfortunately<00:00:19.140> it<00:00:19.410> doesn't<00:00:19.890> work<00:00:20.150> so<00:00:21.199> in

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
but unfortunately it doesn't work so in

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.029 
but unfortunately it doesn't work so in
all<00:00:22.410> forms<00:00:22.859> I<00:00:23.130> checked<00:00:23.760> and<00:00:24.090> they<00:00:24.660> said<00:00:24.930> eh<00:00:25.039> you

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:26.039 
all forms I checked and they said eh you

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:33.040 
all forms I checked and they said eh you
should<00:00:26.660> remove<00:00:27.660> the<00:00:28.609> CMOS<00:00:29.609> battery<00:00:29.660> and

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:33.050 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:35.060 

unfortunately<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.290> other<00:00:34.440> thing<00:00:34.710> is<00:00:34.829> does<00:00:34.980> it

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
unfortunately the other thing is does it

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:37.970 
unfortunately the other thing is does it
work<00:00:35.120> with<00:00:36.120> the<00:00:36.200> reset<00:00:37.200> button<00:00:37.230> removing

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
work with the reset button removing

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.549 
work with the reset button removing
battery<00:00:38.340> etc<00:00:38.760> etc<00:00:38.820> no<00:00:39.540> it<00:00:39.780> doesn't<00:00:40.140> work<00:00:40.170> with

00:00:40.549 --> 00:00:40.559 
battery etc etc no it doesn't work with

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.030 
battery etc etc no it doesn't work with
B<00:00:40.879> so<00:00:41.879> I<00:00:41.910> assume<00:00:42.360> this<00:00:42.540> is<00:00:42.809> also<00:00:43.140> not<00:00:43.590> working

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
B so I assume this is also not working

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.270 
B so I assume this is also not working
it<00:00:44.160> from<00:00:44.340> your<00:00:44.520> side<00:00:44.989> so<00:00:45.989> I<00:00:46.320> thought<00:00:46.829> let's

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
it from your side so I thought let's

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.779 
it from your side so I thought let's
open<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:47.760> oil<00:00:48.030> PC<00:00:48.480> and<00:00:48.660> remove<00:00:49.289> the<00:00:49.789> CMOS

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
open the oil PC and remove the CMOS

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:54.200 
open the oil PC and remove the CMOS
battery<00:00:51.800> however<00:00:52.800> other<00:00:53.160> forum<00:00:53.550> says<00:00:53.850> though

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
battery however other forum says though

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.060 
battery however other forum says though
that<00:00:54.239> you<00:00:54.780> have<00:00:54.930> to<00:00:55.140> remove<00:00:55.440> and<00:00:55.739> cut<00:00:55.980> the

that you have to remove and cut the

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.709 
that you have to remove and cut the

cable etc I don't like it to cut a cable
for<00:01:00.930> my<00:01:01.079> e<00:01:01.579> PC<00:01:02.579> so<00:01:02.940> I<00:01:03.500> just<00:01:04.500> opened<00:01:04.949> my<00:01:05.030> laptop

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
for my e PC so I just opened my laptop

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.620 
for my e PC so I just opened my laptop
as<00:01:06.450> you<00:01:06.630> can<00:01:06.720> see<00:01:07.310> remove<00:01:08.310> all<00:01:08.520> things<00:01:08.880> this<00:01:09.479> is

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
as you can see remove all things this is

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.920 
as you can see remove all things this is
all<00:01:09.780> this<00:01:10.290> link<00:01:10.560> to<00:01:11.189> how<00:01:11.369> to<00:01:11.400> open<00:01:11.790> it<00:01:12.150> it's

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
all this link to how to open it it's

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:17.170 
all this link to how to open it it's
also<00:01:13.520> fine<00:01:14.520> a<00:01:14.549> ball<00:01:14.760> at<00:01:15.110> edit<00:01:16.110> it<00:01:16.619> forms

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:17.180 
also fine a ball at edit it forms

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:22.460 
also fine a ball at edit it forms
however<00:01:18.409> the<00:01:19.409> main<00:01:19.590> thing<00:01:19.799> is<00:01:20.040> that<00:01:20.869> to<00:01:21.869> remove

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
however the main thing is that to remove

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.469 
however the main thing is that to remove
the<00:01:23.009> CMOS<00:01:23.670> up<00:01:24.740> 20<00:01:25.740> seconds<00:01:26.130> there's<00:01:27.090> a<00:01:27.180> better

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
the CMOS up 20 seconds there's a better

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.179 
the CMOS up 20 seconds there's a better
solution<00:01:27.979> then<00:01:28.979> I'll<00:01:29.810> just<00:01:30.810> attach<00:01:31.259> the<00:01:31.740> whole

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189 
solution then I'll just attach the whole

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.660 
solution then I'll just attach the whole
motherboard<00:01:32.970> as<00:01:33.180> you<00:01:33.930> can<00:01:34.079> see<00:01:34.320> at<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:35.430> right

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
there's also a note on the motor board

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.720 
there's also a note on the motor board
in<00:02:17.360> fact<00:02:17.629> I<00:02:17.959> assume<00:02:18.739> that's<00:02:18.890> from<00:02:19.220> the<00:02:19.340> battery

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
in fact I assume that's from the battery

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:26.589 
in fact I assume that's from the battery
so<00:02:20.450> just<00:02:21.319> wait<00:02:21.560> 20<00:02:21.950> seconds<00:02:22.370> and<00:02:25.599> please

00:02:26.589 --> 00:02:26.599 
so just wait 20 seconds and please

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:31.690 
so just wait 20 seconds and please
attach<00:02:27.019> it<00:02:27.230> again<00:02:28.870> so<00:02:29.870> it's<00:02:30.440> more<00:02:31.340> than<00:02:31.489> 20

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:49.069 
so just attach it again to the motor

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:55.360 
so just attach it again to the motor
board<00:02:50.500> yes<00:02:51.500> done<00:02:52.450> okay<00:02:53.769> let's<00:02:54.769> see<00:02:55.010> if<00:02:55.220> it

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.370 
board yes done okay let's see if it

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.900 
board yes done okay let's see if it
works

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
works

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:00.990 
works
