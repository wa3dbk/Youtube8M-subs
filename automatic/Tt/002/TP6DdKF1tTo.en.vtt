00:01:54.090 --> 00:02:01.609
 well what happened through your mind that they did 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.609
 they ran all running because it came 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:10.410
 when we arrived there where 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:13.490
 we go today in ricardo but this house 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.490
 who visits it or what 

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.980
 where it was 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.260
 playing with friends and suddenly by 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.240
 when this thing stops for this gift of 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.230
 success and they go against the wall and 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:28.200
 disappears 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:32.090
 well hear on another occasion have you seen something 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.090
 like after that 

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:39.540
 in your case if they get to lose us 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:41.250
 some objects and then they appear 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:43.580
 all things are moved 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:46.050
 we left them in the room and suddenly 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:48.720
 also a quarter carry in another side 

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:51.120
 go then it's awesome because this 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:54.270
 kind of beings is not so easy to record what 

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:56.190
 I know it's really not that easy to burn them and 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:57.750
 they run a fast that was 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:59.940
 precisely what we talked about yesterday 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:02.490
 that they are very naughty that they are leaving 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:05.850
 moving of course there are several types 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:08.820
 there are many types of beings in this 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:10.860
 kind but many kinds of all 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:12.780

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:15.660
 naughty but really all are 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:17.370
