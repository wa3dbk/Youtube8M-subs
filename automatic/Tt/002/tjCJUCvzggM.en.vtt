00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:20.960 
basically it provides two thousand

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.769 
basically it provides two thousand
milliamps<00:00:21.580> so<00:00:22.580> you're<00:00:22.730> getting<00:00:22.970> double<00:00:23.390> the

00:00:23.769 --> 00:00:23.779 
milliamps so you're getting double the

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:26.319 
milliamps so you're getting double the
double<00:00:24.019> so<00:00:24.529> this<00:00:25.070> provides<00:00:25.490> double<00:00:26.240> the

00:00:26.319 --> 00:00:26.329 
double so this provides double the

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:28.960 
double so this provides double the

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:22.010 
form factor difference as well you see

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:25.690 
form factor difference as well you see
this<00:01:22.790> is<00:01:22.940> a<00:01:22.970> little<00:01:23.180> bit<00:01:23.300> thicker<00:01:23.480> I<00:01:24.580> pull<00:01:25.580> this

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.360 
slightly thicker so you need a little

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:33.880 
slightly thicker so you need a little

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.980 
has a hole for it so I don't know if
that's<00:01:43.040> really<00:01:43.160> important<00:01:43.640> to<00:01:43.730> you<00:01:43.880> but<00:01:44.090> this

the case it's going to slide it in here
is<00:02:40.950> pretty<00:02:41.099> simple<00:02:41.430> design<00:02:41.790> nothing<00:02:42.209> really

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
is pretty simple design nothing really

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.720 
is pretty simple design nothing really
fancy<00:02:42.599> just<00:02:43.290> slide<00:02:43.530> it<00:02:43.650> into<00:02:43.739> the<00:02:43.799> bottom<00:02:44.159> as

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:46.019 
you can tell already it's already trying

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:48.080 
you can tell already it's already trying
to<00:02:46.170> charge<00:02:46.409> you<00:02:47.099> can<00:02:47.280> control<00:02:47.639> if<00:02:47.790> you<00:02:47.879> want<00:02:48.030> to

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090

charge it or not but i will switch at

00:02:49.349 --> 00:02:50.929 
charge it or not but i will switch at
the<00:02:49.409> bottom<00:02:49.560> so<00:02:49.919> right<00:02:50.069> now<00:02:50.099> it's<00:02:50.370> off<00:02:50.549> so<00:02:50.819> it's

00:03:34.969 --> 00:03:34.979 
notice about these cases even though

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:36.740 
notice about these cases even though
they're<00:03:35.129> their<00:03:35.430> main<00:03:35.729> primary<00:03:36.180> function<00:03:36.659> is

they're their main primary function is
extended<00:03:37.169> battery<00:03:37.470> life<00:03:37.620> they're<00:03:38.099> very<00:03:38.400> great

00:03:41.059 --> 00:03:41.069 
with protecting the phone there's a

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:42.949 
with protecting the phone there's a
great<00:03:41.430> distance<00:03:41.729> I<00:03:42.090> actually<00:03:42.479> like<00:03:42.780> this

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
great distance I actually like this

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:44.149 
great distance I actually like this
you're<00:03:43.199> probably<00:03:43.290> thinking<00:03:43.530> hey<00:03:43.949> you're

00:03:44.149 --> 00:03:44.159 
you're probably thinking hey you're

00:03:44.159 --> 00:03:45.140 
you're probably thinking hey you're
going<00:03:44.280> to<00:03:44.340> scratch<00:03:44.519> the<00:03:44.639> back<00:03:44.729> of<00:03:44.879> your<00:03:45.000> phone

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
going to scratch the back of your phone

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:46.640 
going to scratch the back of your phone
taking<00:03:45.750> it<00:03:45.840> in<00:03:45.900> and<00:03:45.959> out<00:03:46.139> the<00:03:46.260> case<00:03:46.470> a<00:03:46.500> lot

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:46.650 
taking it in and out the case a lot

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:47.960 
taking it in and out the case a lot
especially<00:03:46.979> if<00:03:47.280> you<00:03:47.340> have<00:03:47.370> a<00:03:47.459> dock<00:03:47.729> or

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:47.970 
especially if you have a dock or

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:49.490 
especially if you have a dock or
something<00:03:48.299> like<00:03:48.389> that<00:03:48.449> but<00:03:49.229> there's<00:03:49.409> actually

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
something like that but there's actually

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.430 
something like that but there's actually
a<00:03:50.209> distance<00:03:51.209> between<00:03:51.540> is<00:03:51.690> a<00:03:51.720> gap<00:03:52.019> of<00:03:52.049> air

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:52.440 
a distance between is a gap of air

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.729 
a distance between is a gap of air
between<00:03:52.650> this<00:03:53.549> case<00:03:53.879> and<00:03:54.260> this<00:03:55.260> case<00:03:55.319> in<00:03:55.650> the

00:03:55.729 --> 00:03:55.739 
between this case and this case in the

00:03:55.739 --> 00:03:57.289 
between this case and this case in the
phone<00:03:55.979> so<00:03:56.639> you<00:03:56.669> don't<00:03:56.760> have<00:03:56.909> to<00:03:57.000> worry<00:03:57.180> about
