 for garage road pricing in nonsense this is a make-up 

00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:07.750
 inspired by the latest collection of hannibal lagoon 

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:10.859
 for this year's cibeles fashion week 

00:00:10.859 --> 00:00:14.169

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:20.109
 very strong this is done with a quite dramatic makeup some eyes 

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:24.620
 very elongated and a nose that also have prominence the Alavés have 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:28.589
 a tail alteration of the valley in this way we are going to create 

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:32.920
 prominence also in the lips valera cellular and very striking and in 

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:37.300
 definitive as I say it is a pretty makeup already martí car this brand is 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.989
 use it to mediate and the country graduate the colon today in which to change 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:45.670
 colors but she wanted a gift because I really like it a lot 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:47.800
 catwalk makeup and blackberry 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:57.000
 only once and 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.210
 as you already know the class 100 so that it endures much discomfort with the alliance 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:24.310
 Agreed yesterday throughout the day 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:27.689
 do not go to what is saying colors there creating vie 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:31.210
 that's why it's important they always used just 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:41.090
 and so we learn to do is to apply percent a base denied and used or 

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.060
 woman with an illegal in jeans 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.200
 happened was to use the one you want or even a pencil in black 

00:02:17.449 --> 00:02:21.299
 to intensify the fence we are going to apply a black matte shadow we are going to 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:24.979
 do it for all the part that we have applied in our black base and 

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:27.979
 we are also going to give shape to our makeup 

00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:51.580
 it is important that this makeup we start 

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.779
 very good the eye and let's do it 

00:02:53.779 --> 00:02:58.489
 creating a shadow until we get to the file by the bottom we will make 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:03.569
 the same process we are going to make black the racket lower sizes and 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:07.290
 we are going to go up to the color ascending the next step is 

00:03:07.289 --> 00:03:09.569
 blur is very important diffuse 

00:03:09.569 --> 00:03:14.429
 just valero pointed out in this makeup because we want to keep that line so 

00:03:14.429 --> 00:03:17.169
 strong as is the diagonal 

00:03:17.169 --> 00:03:22.299
 from this game the probe team of our basin to reach the top 

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:34.339
 min 

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:38.929
 the next is to apply a golden shadow let's do it from the animal 

00:03:38.929 --> 00:03:42.889
 up to the first third of our eyelids and up to the eyelid civil 

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:45.799
 between zone celia the third zone 

00:03:45.799 --> 00:03:48.799
 second and first 

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:03.489
 umbro 

00:04:13.589 --> 00:04:17.060
 On this occasion, apply the energetic chart, indicating that there is 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:21.139
 you can jump sterile this pass applies only mascara and 

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:24.870
 also an important part is delineating the triples of water in it 

00:04:32.770 --> 00:04:37.090
 we have already completely finished eye makeup the following our skin as 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:39.840
 always runs towards the makeup base the only thing we're going to do 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:44.080
 now it is with torreal our faces we are going to intensify a part of the 

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:49.120
 and we're going to get to the odd ones fighting a faith for this 

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:52.120
 part 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:16.460
 the last one just to talk about and that is that the general election process ali is a 

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:19.460
 little different the first thing I'm going to do is apply a base in color 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:20.449
 Bordeaux 

00:05:20.449 --> 00:05:23.629
 then a liner in a brown color 

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:27.610
 quite raised that is a very dark brown 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:31.930
 and the next thing you're going to do is apply only the central zone of 

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:34.620
 our stadium a lipstick in red 

00:05:34.620 --> 00:05:38.800
 we are going to blur this extract so that it is not very striking that we have applied 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:42.870
 three colors but that is a gradient and for this I am going to facilitate with a 

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:45.870
 synthetic brush 

00:05:49.449 --> 00:05:52.449
 dyn 

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:57.650
 min 

00:06:04.009 --> 00:06:07.009
 min 

00:06:10.589 --> 00:06:13.589
 min 

00:06:38.069 --> 00:06:42.389
 they also have to pay more to finish this makeup completely as you see 

00:06:42.389 --> 00:06:46.249
 It's a very daring makeup but I wanted to bring to see 

00:06:46.249 --> 00:06:50.009
 percent this makeup which in my case as I did 

00:06:50.529 --> 00:06:54.469
 as always if you have some kind of help to the work dgs there is nothing else we 

00:06:54.469 --> 00:06:55.409
 it is worth saying that I
