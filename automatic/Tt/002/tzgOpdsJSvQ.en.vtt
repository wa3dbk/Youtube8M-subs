00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:10.920
 we are in 1.5 points we are going to see a mod 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:12.750
 appeared lollipop girl the truth is 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.020
 how I explain it 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:19.680
 to me there is a minecraft rose that is what 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:22.590
 that I see the biggest problem, I think 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:24.090
 is that you make your house and then you 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.330
 you want to go explore simply because 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.700
 yes 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:30.880
 Grace me and this because you have the one 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:33.910
 you want to investigate for whatever 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:36.489
 and you can not take your house there 

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:37.960
 the problem because back is a house you 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:40.180
 pretty and then you have to make another one 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.699
 another site, something good, let's see what 

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:44.170
 what do you do is you can take your house 

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:46.750
 Wherever you want to go appeared super 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:49.510
 epic but the postmen you have in the 

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:51.730
 description in the link that you have in the 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:53.290
 description as I always leave it in the 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:55.329
 description the link of the mod there you have 

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:58.570
 the postmen to make these objects from 

00:00:55.329 --> 00:01:01.540
 here this is open 

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.820
 we're not going to see it first put this 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:06.050
 jalopy 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:10.940
 chachi piruli then we have to put 

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:14.000
 with a short corner corner market as well 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:15.620
 as far as we want 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.630
 take us let's see what I'm 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:21.790
 creative had not put this in a way 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.790
 that I am that way of everything I suppose 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:28.000
 let's do it like that I want to take everything 

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.000
 this 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:35.930
 is exposed here it is assumed that this is 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:39.290
 as a square from the area where 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:42.460
 you put the marker this here to see 

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:44.890
 small interruptions let's see 

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:48.610
 it's supposed to be a square from where 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:52.140
 you put the marker like this here and here 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:54.570
 and here like a square 

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.800
 So here you simply carry everything 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.780
 what's inside that square 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.930
 imaginary 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:05.310
 so if we give it now with the blue 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:08.310
 print with my level of good english 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.990
 we give it to him and we take it super epic 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:11.370
 they give us this one here that comes to be 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.880
 well there are things that you do not take 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.700
 perfect 

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:17.350
 this here is exactly what we 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.320
 we have taken 

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:22.709
 and today we are going to take what I want 

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:26.130
 put it here 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:26.130
 we give here 

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:31.510
 an egg mola or it had seemed super 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:33.430
 ethical fashion there are things like this that 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:36.930
 they have failures like 6 watching but with 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:36.930
 this you can go there where you want 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:41.660
 you can go wherever you want with this and 

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:45.050
 Take your whole house or I think it's 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:46.550
 very very good then there is another thing like 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:49.730
 you see 

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:51.620
 here marker has disappeared good for 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:54.620
 that we have this that is the market 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:56.510
 advanced that does not disappear 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:58.720
 simply and that we can not carry 

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.720
 now 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:08.340
 I do not know is that I do not know if I can take 

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:10.500
 all this has as if it were a 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:13.590
 kind of maximum radio we're going to put 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:16.220
 this here about the advanced 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.220
 is there 

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.280
 here maybe 

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:25.830
 let's see what we are going to put this here 

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:29.310
 here 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:32.010
 I think it would be and not more or less this 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:35.000
 disappears this disappears in reality 

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:41.360
 I'm just creative 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:41.360
 not having put it higher 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:47.530
 liked it or had not thought it was a 

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:51.250
 square has brought me here 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:53.890
 and from here to here I have left with the 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:57.090
 well a little touched but does not pass na 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:04:00.660
 and then we take it wherever 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:04.630
 around here right here 

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:07.330
 and here we do not have half wells to carry 

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:09.610
 the villagers also the super epic and 

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:12.940
 As you can see, the marker follows the advance 

00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:14.350
 it does not disappear when it 's chachi 

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:16.840
 Piruli mo details this advanced and now 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:18.239
 you can go pulling it and transporting 

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:19.709
 all the time 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:21.760
 but well this is the way that has 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:24.090
 seemed very interesting 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:27.720
 the truth and I hope you liked it 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:30.730
