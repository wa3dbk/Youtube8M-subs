00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:12.339
 [Music] 

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:19.310
 Alberto as tutorials to connect your 

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:20.990
 xbox console to your cell phone 

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:23.119
 no need for cables to use 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:24.529
 no other way already has a 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:25.369
 clarification because they are going to 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:26.900
 ask 

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:28.460
 I do not want cables I mean the 

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:33.070
 phone is to connect in any way 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:38.120
 because the control 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:41.989
 and of course network cable as good 

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:45.540
 is a modem or an order that can emit 

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:47.640
 the wifi signal thing that I have here 

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:49.829
 and that brings us the vote that there will be no 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.899
 ip management that works 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.350
 as our cell phone you do not have a 

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.350
 smartphone 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:01.910
 much 

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:05.530
 good of cases of more space explore 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:05.530
 the mechanics in the description 

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:11.480
 we need water or anything on the cell phone 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:14.060
 we only have our wifi and in any case 

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:16.250
 the data synchronization some 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.490
 cell phones we hope it connects via 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.490
 Wifi 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:25.800
 it's better since you learned our website 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:29.479
 as you can see, it is connected to the network 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.479
 let's open our program 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:44.549
 let's click on new job 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.549
 the programs that do this 

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:55.850
 and then what are we going to give 

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:55.850
 good here 

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:00.110
 we wait 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:06.820
 We already said click on new 

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:06.820
 in the term in which this pe 

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:13.970
 good click 

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:18.310
 our keyboard is expected and what are we going to 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:21.300
 do let's type the choice says 

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.300
 that we can not have here 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:24.340
 in my case it would be 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.320
 192 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.320
 world 

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:35.129
 to that team 168 points 

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:40.299
 1.3 

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.760
 and I can not change it I do not know why 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:04.590
 11.30 21 as it is here 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:07.790
 I believe that in that username 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.790
 I have a word the bot 

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:15.140
 and in the password 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:18.959
 in the same way we want something 

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:26.560
 even though 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:28.750
 and this is clear, we are going to the void 

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:32.550
 and we click ok 

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:32.550
 while you watch but minutes 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:43.610
 with great will already say that there is a user 

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:47.770
 in our program this folder appears 

00:03:51.070 --> 00:04:01.570
 fx and facebook and we can make copies 

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:01.570
 what is this good for? 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:08.140
 can change the xml conflict and so 

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:09.340
 can change the skins and 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:11.300
 audio configurations your boats 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:13.340
 among other things 

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:15.960
 it would also be very useful as for example 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:18.090
 transfer songs to your web 

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:19.889
 because I have two movies saved in 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:22.259
 fear too 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:26.719
 on the other hand so much of the web is towards 

00:04:22.259 --> 00:04:26.719
 this view true 

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:31.130
 I have a folder 

00:04:32.050 --> 00:04:37.919
 and it has all these songs I'm going to 

00:04:34.629 --> 00:04:37.919
 transfer any song 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.889
 and we are going to drink 

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:49.169
 making clear our cell phone does not have 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:51.930
 that being a voice does not need to have 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:55.169
 this can work like that simply 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:57.530
 well I want to look for some one 

00:04:55.169 --> 00:04:57.530
 song 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:02.229
 our duty are 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:07.490
 and that completes with jokin dt 

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:10.830
 I'm going to copy 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:15.750
 we go back to where we were 

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:25.620
 and then we implement ourselves in this 

00:05:23.660 --> 00:05:28.550
 tab and it's here 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:28.550
 and we stick it 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:35.150
 it is normal that while this happens that in 

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:38.979
 this likes uncheck zero because it 

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:38.979
 disconnect the web constantly but 

00:05:41.159 --> 00:05:44.159
 transferring 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:52.660
 as it says that I copied it and this 

00:05:50.030 --> 00:06:00.300
 will connect again 

00:05:52.660 --> 00:06:00.300
 well no sir 

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:05.160
 and my ego 

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:11.340
 I'm going to do it 

00:06:11.529 --> 00:06:16.299
 here I have the xv mt for the pro for 

00:06:14.799 --> 00:06:18.909
 browse files and search the file 

00:06:16.299 --> 00:06:20.619
 audio that after how to transfer the 

00:06:18.909 --> 00:06:26.159
 which in the subject matter I put a 

00:06:20.619 --> 00:06:26.159
 folder is good I want 

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:29.990
 look 

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:36.010
 and as you will see here practically point m3 

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:41.470
 it was volume 

00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:48.290
 one night he plays in equal detention 

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:49.970
 way we can transfer games with or 

00:06:48.290 --> 00:06:51.370
 transfer music we will transfer 

00:06:49.970 --> 00:06:53.440
 video 

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:55.930
 with another series of applications with other 

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:56.770
 about anything works with that the 

00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:58.650
 phone 

00:06:56.770 --> 00:07:01.750
 be with android operating system 

00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:03.910
 new import if it's old from this 

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:06.970
 explanation also the view that is 

00:07:03.910 --> 00:07:09.160
 that similar cradle for the year that is the 

00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:10.419
 iphones cell phones with an application 

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:13.540
 similar for the connectable to it 

00:07:10.419 --> 00:07:15.400
 way is how to use the flash xk for the 

00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:17.979
 computers because here you connect 

00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:20.139
 another cell phone because so 

00:07:17.979 --> 00:07:22.490
 wireless there's never connect you 

00:07:20.139 --> 00:07:25.689
 people who are here this charger 

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:28.330
 this is the cell phone charger only 

00:07:25.689 --> 00:07:31.910
 and we bring us transferred from this 

00:07:28.330 --> 00:07:35.160
 network cable that is connected here 

00:07:31.910 --> 00:07:37.449
 we do not believe in it 

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:39.400
 the unique addition 

00:07:37.449 --> 00:07:41.020
 in our way that they were promoted 

00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:43.029
 have to support the connection to 

00:07:41.020 --> 00:07:45.840
 wireless internet in this case 

00:07:43.029 --> 00:07:45.840
 call w lan 

00:07:46.139 --> 00:07:49.319
 but this does not count on any other 

00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:51.150
 type of files 

00:07:49.319 --> 00:07:53.069
 I hope I have served you we see the 

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:56.330
 next any doubt comment and not 

00:07:53.069 --> 00:07:56.330
 I think we see each other sometimes
