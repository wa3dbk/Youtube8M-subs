00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
so if I were to go to the pool with some

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.990 
so if I were to go to the pool with some
bright<00:02:17.720> lipstick<00:02:18.170> and<00:02:18.380> just<00:02:18.680> this<00:02:19.130> and<00:02:19.490> doodle

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
bright lipstick and just this and doodle

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.420 
bright lipstick and just this and doodle
mascara<00:02:20.450> I<00:02:20.690> would<00:02:21.230> do<00:02:21.380> it<00:02:21.500> I<00:02:21.740> think<00:02:21.860> that<00:02:22.250> the

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:22.430 
mascara I would do it I think that the

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:23.980 
mascara I would do it I think that the
perfect<00:02:22.610> combination<00:02:23.000> for<00:02:23.270> someone<00:02:23.660> who<00:02:23.810> has

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:23.990 
perfect combination for someone who has

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:25.870 
perfect combination for someone who has
really<00:02:24.380> oily<00:02:24.590> skin<00:02:24.980> would<00:02:25.160> be<00:02:25.310> to<00:02:25.489> just<00:02:25.640> use<00:02:25.730> a

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:25.880 
really oily skin would be to just use a

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:28.390 
really oily skin would be to just use a
matte<00:02:26.270> foundation<00:02:26.480> over<00:02:27.140> this<00:02:27.290> so<00:02:28.040> you<00:02:28.100> still

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
matte foundation over this so you still

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.370 
matte foundation over this so you still
have<00:02:28.550> a<00:02:28.580> hint<00:02:28.910> of<00:02:29.060> that<00:02:29.239> doing<00:02:29.720> this<00:02:29.840> but<00:02:30.230> it's

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
have a hint of that doing this but it's

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.040 
have a hint of that doing this but it's
not<00:02:30.470> you<00:02:31.250> know<00:02:31.370> overbearing<00:02:32.239> for<00:02:32.510> someone<00:02:32.959> who

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:33.050 
not you know overbearing for someone who
