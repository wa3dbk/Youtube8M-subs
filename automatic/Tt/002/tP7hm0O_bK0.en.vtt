00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
probably one of my most proud gameplays

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.859 
probably one of my most proud gameplays
I've<00:00:16.770> ever<00:00:17.130> uploaded<00:00:17.609> on<00:00:17.910> my<00:00:18.090> channel<00:00:18.539> this<00:00:18.720> is

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
I've ever uploaded on my channel this is

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.710 
I've ever uploaded on my channel this is
actually<00:00:19.320> a<00:00:19.350> reupload<00:00:20.100> but<00:00:21.060> the<00:00:21.330> other<00:00:21.510> one

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
actually a reupload but the other one

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.050 
actually a reupload but the other one
barely<00:00:22.140> had<00:00:22.350> any<00:00:22.619> views<00:00:23.039> and<00:00:23.279> you<00:00:23.550> know<00:00:23.670> it<00:00:23.939> was

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
barely had any views and you know it was

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.179 
barely had any views and you know it was
such<00:00:24.210> a<00:00:24.240> long<00:00:24.480> time<00:00:24.720> ago<00:00:24.930> and<00:00:25.140> such<00:00:25.320> a<00:00:25.350> shitty

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
such a long time ago and such a shitty

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:27.890 
such a long time ago and such a shitty
commentary<00:00:26.490> for<00:00:26.910> such<00:00:27.119> a<00:00:27.150> good<00:00:27.420> gameplay<00:00:27.869> I

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:27.900 
commentary for such a good gameplay I

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.689 
commentary for such a good gameplay I
think<00:00:28.109> it<00:00:28.170> was<00:00:28.230> a<00:00:28.289> shame<00:00:28.590> what<00:00:29.310> you<00:00:29.400> guys<00:00:29.519> are

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
think it was a shame what you guys are

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:31.820 
think it was a shame what you guys are
watching<00:00:29.939> is<00:00:30.599> if<00:00:30.840> you<00:00:31.050> notice<00:00:31.439> that<00:00:31.470> in<00:00:31.740> the

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
watching is if you notice that in the

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.040 
watching is if you notice that in the
very<00:00:32.009> beginning<00:00:32.250> of<00:00:32.640> the<00:00:32.759> game<00:00:33.000> that<00:00:33.690> my

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
very beginning of the game that my

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.250 
very beginning of the game that my
initial<00:00:34.680> score<00:00:35.190> was<00:00:35.670> zero<00:00:36.030> and<00:00:36.329> the<00:00:36.450> initial

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
initial score was zero and the initial

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.310 
initial score was zero and the initial
score<00:00:37.500> of<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.739> top<00:00:37.980> guy<00:00:38.219> was<00:00:39.170> 1400<00:00:40.170> which

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
score of the top guy was 1400 which

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.200 
score of the top guy was 1400 which
means<00:00:40.559> he<00:00:40.649> needs<00:00:40.800> two<00:00:41.100> more<00:00:41.129> kills<00:00:41.579> to<00:00:41.790> go<00:00:41.940> and

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
means he needs two more kills to go and

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.720 
means he needs two more kills to go and
i<00:00:42.930> joined<00:00:43.350> this<00:00:43.469> game<00:00:43.739> and<00:00:44.040> he<00:00:44.309> needs<00:00:44.520> two<00:00:44.700> more

i joined this game and he needs two more

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.119 
i joined this game and he needs two more
kills<00:00:45.180> and<00:00:45.539> i<00:00:45.960> ended<00:00:46.200> up<00:00:46.289> getting<00:00:46.620> a<00:00:46.680> nuke<00:00:46.890> and

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
kills and i ended up getting a nuke and

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:50.930 
kills and i ended up getting a nuke and
winning<00:00:47.399> the<00:00:47.550> game<00:00:47.760> before<00:00:48.450> he<00:00:48.690> does<00:00:49.110> so<00:00:50.010> that

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
winning the game before he does so that

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.549 
winning the game before he does so that
is<00:00:51.149> why<00:00:51.300> this<00:00:51.360> game<00:00:51.690> is<00:00:51.750> so<00:00:52.020> awesome<00:00:52.199> and

is why this game is so awesome and

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.170 
is why this game is so awesome and

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
that's where the timer starts the first
