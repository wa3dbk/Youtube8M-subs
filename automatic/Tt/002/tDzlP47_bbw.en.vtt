 [Music] 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:12.410
 the French and Spanish presidents 

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:13.910
 françois hollande and mariano rajoy has 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:16.369
 celebrated in Paris the twenty-first 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:18.590
 bilateral summit marked by the 

00:00:16.369 --> 00:00:20.869
 satisfaction of both countries for the 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:23.060
 coincidence of views the 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:25.009
 Spanish president who has indicated in 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:27.079
 relation to the bad forecasts of the 

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:29.540
 international monetary fund for its 

00:00:27.079 --> 00:00:31.250
 country my goal will be that they are not met 

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:33.530
 Forecasts of the monetary fund 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:35.090
 international and that logically then it 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.040
 comply with those made by the government of 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:39.920
 Spain as I suppose it will be the objective 

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:42.350
 from either country the two 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.840
 presidents and ministers have 

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:47.059

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:49.670
 excellence of the relations between both 

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:52.340
 countries but in front of the embassy of 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:54.230
 Spain there are those who do not share the same 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.760
 opinion among the protesters is 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.829
 they find mónica that for having 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.719
 deployed a Spanish flag before the 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:01.760
 Elysium when the car passed 

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:03.949
 president rajoy we have removed the flag 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.770
 and we have shouted are you mortgaging in 

00:01:03.949 --> 00:01:09.560
 our country and in rajoy has seen it but 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:11.810
 soon the national police has 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.460
 surrounded has taken us two streets 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.350
 parallel to the street of the elyse 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:17.400
 and they have frisked us and they have taken the 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.710
 data and then they have taken us to the 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.930
 would comisaría these Spaniards in paris that 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.190
 they have many things to say to 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.560
 Mariano Rajoy 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:28.130
 we want to denounce that our government 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:31.110
 with all the measures you are taking 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:33.780
 it is accentuating the crisis even more 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.520
 who is suffering in our country with 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.340
 all the cuts that are leading to 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.229
 out in social services with the 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.690
 labor reform I do not like politics 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.399
 who is having and besides that is not the 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:46.800
 that his election campaign was coming because if 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:49.229
 at least I did not like it but it's the 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.720
 that people would have voted well 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:53.460
 but it is that it does not even fulfill its 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.500
 promises in front of an impressive 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.300
 peaceful deployment of the police 

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.880
 protesters ask the president 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:01.830
 Spanish that goes like dozens of 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:05.369
 thousands of young people who see the future with 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:08.759
 great concern we are here forced 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:12.510
 because it is not impossible for a young man 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:15.420
 now develop professionally in 

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:17.550
 Spain 'and the fault of this is the 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.049
 government that sees everything very black and already 

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.250
 not only in Spain but also in 

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:22.220
 France because it is 

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.600
 we tend to idealize a lot of France and 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:27.120
 It is not that it goes so well and in 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:29.070
 This is generally what in any country 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.410
 wrong things there's not much future for 

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:33.270
 nobody really economic situation 

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:35.070
 of Spain has led the protesters 

00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:37.290
 to remind the president of the government 

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:39.690
 Spanish Mariano Rajoy in front of his 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.550
 embassy in paris that the duties are 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:44.250
 still to be done and that the few that have 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:46.200
 done them wrong to the solutions 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:48.570
 of the French and Spanish governments 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.709
 today they do not convince or to the demonstrators 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:52.530
 or millions of citizens 

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:55.200

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:59.450
 promises that today do not fulfill or to jose
