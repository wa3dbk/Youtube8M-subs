00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
just so the papers will pick up i think

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:37.100

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.679 
i'm i think if Liverpool offer him a new
contract<00:01:37.140> he<00:01:37.770> will<00:01:37.920> definitely<00:01:38.610> accept<00:01:38.970> why

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
contract he will definitely accept why

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.749

he<00:02:17.099> doesn't<00:02:17.519> retire<00:02:17.879> or<00:02:18.269> I<00:02:18.330> or<00:02:18.810> doesn't<00:02:19.349> leave

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:19.530 
he doesn't retire or I or doesn't leave

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.020 
he doesn't retire or I or doesn't leave
at<00:02:20.040> another<00:02:20.819> club<00:02:21.120> to<00:02:21.659> another<00:02:21.930> cup<00:02:22.200> I<00:02:22.379> think

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
at another club to another cup I think

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.410 
at another club to another cup I think
he<00:02:24.030> has<00:02:24.209> still<00:02:24.950> potentially<00:02:25.950> one<00:02:26.849> or<00:02:27.239> maybe

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
he has still potentially one or maybe

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.100 
he has still potentially one or maybe
two<00:02:27.599> maybe<00:02:28.019> three<00:02:28.590> good<00:02:29.489> seasons<00:02:30.090> in<00:02:30.269> him<00:02:30.510> I

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:31.110 
two maybe three good seasons in him I

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:33.770 
two maybe three good seasons in him I
mean<00:02:31.680> Ryan<00:02:31.950> Giggs<00:02:32.220> played<00:02:32.700> until<00:02:32.940> he<00:02:33.239> was<00:02:33.420> 40

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
mean Ryan Giggs played until he was 40

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.800 
mean Ryan Giggs played until he was 40
so<00:02:34.340> there<00:02:35.340> is<00:02:35.430> no<00:02:35.579> reason<00:02:35.790> George<00:02:36.269> to<00:02:36.450> retire

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
so there is no reason George to retire

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.670 
so there is no reason George to retire
now<00:02:37.079> you<00:02:37.140> can<00:02:37.560> still<00:02:37.920> plan<00:02:38.220> offer<00:02:38.610> plenty<00:02:39.030> of

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:39.680 
now you can still plan offer plenty of

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:43.490 
now you can still plan offer plenty of
goals<00:02:40.680> and<00:02:41.010> assists<00:02:41.549> for<00:02:42.360> Liverpool<00:02:42.840> and<00:02:43.079> I

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
goals and assists for Liverpool and I

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.009 
goals and assists for Liverpool and I
really<00:02:43.829> hope<00:02:43.920> that<00:02:44.160> we<00:02:44.430> don't<00:02:44.610> let<00:02:45.019> situation

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:46.019 
really hope that we don't let situation

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:50.449 
really hope that we don't let situation
go<00:02:46.640> just<00:02:47.640> like<00:02:47.849> a<00:02:48.109> chassis<00:02:49.109> left<00:02:49.349> chassis<00:02:50.310> let

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:50.459 
go just like a chassis left chassis let

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:52.550 
go just like a chassis left chassis let
their<00:02:50.790> college<00:02:51.269> and<00:02:51.480> Lampard<00:02:51.959> leave<00:02:52.170> and<00:02:52.470> I

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
their college and Lampard leave and I

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.949 
their college and Lampard leave and I
think<00:02:52.799> that<00:02:52.950> was<00:02:53.129> a<00:02:53.160> bad<00:02:53.940> decision<00:02:54.120> by<00:02:54.660> him

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
think that was a bad decision by him

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:56.449 
think that was a bad decision by him
because<00:02:55.590> you<00:02:55.890> know<00:02:56.010> Lampard<00:02:56.400> scored

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
because you know Lampard scored

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:59.270 
because you know Lampard scored
equalizer<00:02:57.209> for<00:02:57.420> man<00:02:57.750> city<00:02:57.780> and<00:02:58.290> the<00:02:58.470> and<00:02:59.010> he's

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280 
equalizer for man city and the and he's

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:00.979 
equalizer for man city and the and he's
really<00:02:59.609> really<00:02:59.970> playing<00:03:00.329> well<00:03:00.420> for<00:03:00.599> man<00:03:00.959> city

00:03:00.979 --> 00:03:00.989 
really really playing well for man city

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:04.430 
really really playing well for man city
so<00:03:01.440> I<00:03:01.470> think<00:03:01.620> Chelsea<00:03:02.430> should<00:03:02.640> have<00:03:03.410> had<00:03:04.410> a

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
so I think Chelsea should have had a

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:07.430 
so I think Chelsea should have had a
Lampard<00:03:05.400> retired<00:03:05.819> I<00:03:06.090> have<00:03:06.239> a<00:03:06.720> lot<00:03:06.870> of<00:03:06.900> respect

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:07.440 
Lampard retired I have a lot of respect

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.800 
Lampard retired I have a lot of respect

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810 
from Fran for Franklin partner and I

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:14.199 
from Fran for Franklin partner and I
think<00:03:10.349> Liverpool<00:03:11.329> should<00:03:12.329> do<00:03:12.480> the<00:03:12.660> same<00:03:12.690> Jared

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:14.209 
think Liverpool should do the same Jared

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:17.150 
think Liverpool should do the same Jared
don't<00:03:15.209> let<00:03:15.480> him<00:03:15.660> leave<00:03:15.720> please<00:03:16.290> Liverpool<00:03:16.889> and

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:00.199 
first time in a whole year and they beat
tottenham<00:03:57.750> away<00:03:58.019> and<00:03:58.349> maths<00:03:58.709> it<00:03:58.950> away<00:03:59.340> did<00:04:00.030> not

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209 
tottenham away and maths it away did not

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:01.819 
tottenham away and maths it away did not
mess<00:04:00.540> it<00:04:00.569> out<00:04:00.900> of<00:04:01.109> the<00:04:01.230> league<00:04:01.379> cup<00:04:01.560> and<00:04:01.769> the

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:01.829 
mess it out of the league cup and the

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:03.050 
mess it out of the league cup and the
words<00:04:02.099> that<00:04:02.129> game<00:04:02.489> they<00:04:02.700> were<00:04:02.760> very

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
words that game they were very

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:04.849 
words that game they were very
impressive<00:04:03.690> message<00:04:04.049> it<00:04:04.169> wasted<00:04:04.590> a<00:04:04.680> lot<00:04:04.709> of

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:04.859 
impressive message it wasted a lot of

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:07.369 
impressive message it wasted a lot of
chances<00:04:05.430> but<00:04:05.609> you<00:04:05.760> can<00:04:05.970> so<00:04:06.150> we're<00:04:06.329> very<00:04:06.379> solid

00:04:07.369 --> 00:04:07.379 
chances but you can so we're very solid

00:04:07.379 --> 00:04:09.770 
chances but you can so we're very solid
defensively<00:04:08.040> just<00:04:08.849> like<00:04:09.000> against<00:04:09.299> Tottenham

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
defensively just like against Tottenham

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:11.839 
defensively just like against Tottenham
so<00:04:09.959> I<00:04:09.989> think<00:04:10.109> I<00:04:10.680> think<00:04:11.160> it<00:04:11.310> will<00:04:11.489> be<00:04:11.609> a<00:04:11.639> very

00:04:11.839 --> 00:04:11.849 
so I think I think it will be a very

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:15.170 
so I think I think it will be a very
difficult<00:04:12.090> game<00:04:12.569> and<00:04:13.340> liverpool<00:04:14.340> will<00:04:14.940> have

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:15.180 
difficult game and liverpool will have

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:17.270 
difficult game and liverpool will have
to<00:04:15.359> be<00:04:15.480> at<00:04:15.690> their<00:04:15.930> very<00:04:16.289> best<00:04:16.440> if<00:04:16.859> they<00:04:16.979> want<00:04:17.219> to

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
to be at their very best if they want to

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:18.960
