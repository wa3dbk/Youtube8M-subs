hey<00:00:06.980> this<00:00:07.220> is<00:00:07.310> diamond<00:00:07.610> driver<00:00:07.820> back<00:00:08.120> again

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:08.480 
hey this is diamond driver back again

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:11.410 
hey this is diamond driver back again
with<00:00:08.720> another<00:00:08.780> installment<00:00:09.590> of<00:00:09.860> the<00:00:10.420> scratch

00:00:16.210 --> 00:00:16.220 
built airbus a300 build okay now you see

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:18.580 
built airbus a300 build okay now you see
this<00:00:16.369> here<00:00:16.430> this<00:00:16.820> is<00:00:16.970> the<00:00:17.000> lower<00:00:17.300> portion<00:00:18.260> of

this here this is the lower portion of
the<00:00:18.710> upper<00:00:19.540> part<00:00:20.540> of<00:00:20.660> the<00:00:20.770> a300<00:00:21.770> fuselage<00:00:22.430> now

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:23.830 
the upper part of the a300 fuselage now

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:28.720 
the upper part of the a300 fuselage now
this<00:00:24.830> is<00:00:25.360> drywall<00:00:26.360> tape<00:00:26.660> okay<00:00:27.470> I<00:00:27.680> put<00:00:28.550> two

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:28.730 
this is drywall tape okay I put two

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:34.450 
this is drywall tape okay I put two
pieces<00:00:28.970> here<00:00:29.630> and<00:00:30.910> then<00:00:31.910> epoxy<00:00:32.809> it<00:00:32.900> and<00:00:33.460> acts

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:34.460 
pieces here and then epoxy it and acts

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:36.850 
pieces here and then epoxy it and acts
kind<00:00:34.760> of<00:00:34.790> like<00:00:34.910> fiberglass<00:00:35.330> and<00:00:35.780> it<00:00:36.290> really

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:36.860 
kind of like fiberglass and it really

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:38.799 
kind of like fiberglass and it really
strengthens<00:00:37.370> the<00:00:37.790> lower<00:00:38.000> portion<00:00:38.450> of<00:00:38.720> the

00:00:38.799 --> 00:00:38.809 
strengthens the lower portion of the

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:41.049 
strengthens the lower portion of the
fuselage<00:00:39.290> of<00:00:39.320> the<00:00:39.559> a300<00:00:40.190> and<00:00:40.340> of<00:00:40.730> all<00:00:40.880> my

fuselage of the a300 and of all my
airliners<00:00:41.570> the<00:00:42.320> present<00:00:42.680> i<00:00:42.739> do<00:00:42.800> this<00:00:43.040> is<00:00:43.250> if

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:43.520 
airliners the present i do this is if

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.330 
airliners the present i do this is if
you<00:00:43.760> ever<00:00:44.290> have<00:00:45.290> a<00:00:45.320> hard<00:00:45.559> landing<00:00:45.920> you<00:00:46.100> break

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:46.340 
you ever have a hard landing you break

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.660 
you ever have a hard landing you break
your<00:00:46.489> landing<00:00:46.910> gear<00:00:47.120> your<00:00:47.329> retracts<00:00:47.750> whatever

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:48.670 
your landing gear your retracts whatever

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:52.209 
your landing gear your retracts whatever
retracts<00:00:49.670> don't<00:00:49.910> come<00:00:50.090> down<00:00:50.770> it's<00:00:51.770> not<00:00:52.010> going

00:00:52.209 --> 00:00:52.219 
retracts don't come down it's not going

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:53.920 
retracts don't come down it's not going
to<00:00:52.309> gauge<00:00:52.550> the<00:00:52.969> depron<00:00:53.360> it's<00:00:53.600> not<00:00:53.719> going<00:00:53.840> to

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:53.930 
to gauge the depron it's not going to

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:56.049 
to gauge the depron it's not going to
tear<00:00:54.140> it<00:00:54.290> up<00:00:54.379> to<00:00:54.559> bed<00:00:54.800> and<00:00:55.070> it's<00:00:55.640> going<00:00:55.790> to<00:00:55.879> give

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:56.059 
tear it up to bed and it's going to give

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:01.900 
tear it up to bed and it's going to give
some<00:00:56.270> strength<00:00:56.629> and<00:00:59.980> the<00:01:00.980> bottom<00:01:01.370> portion<00:01:01.760> of

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:01.910 
some strength and the bottom portion of

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.270 
some strength and the bottom portion of
the<00:01:02.090> wing<00:01:02.390> box<00:01:02.629> will<00:01:02.930> also<00:01:03.230> be<00:01:03.379> fiberglass<00:01:03.980> if

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280 
the wing box will also be fiberglass if

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.219 
the wing box will also be fiberglass if
that<00:01:04.640> will<00:01:04.759> be<00:01:04.789> with<00:01:05.000> fiberglass<00:01:05.509> mesh<00:01:05.810> with

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:06.229 
that will be with fiberglass mesh with

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:10.180 
that will be with fiberglass mesh with
actual<00:01:06.590> cloth<00:01:07.460> that<00:01:08.210> will<00:01:08.420> be<00:01:08.570> epoxy<00:01:09.530> for

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:10.190 
actual cloth that will be epoxy for

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:12.850 
actual cloth that will be epoxy for
strength<00:01:10.490> and<00:01:10.899> that's<00:01:11.899> very<00:01:12.110> important<00:01:12.679> on

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:12.860 
strength and that's very important on

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:14.980 
strength and that's very important on
all<00:01:13.069> my<00:01:13.280> bills<00:01:13.520> I<00:01:13.729> want<00:01:13.940> them<00:01:14.030> to<00:01:14.090> be<00:01:14.300> strong<00:01:14.690> so

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:14.990 
all my bills I want them to be strong so

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:16.779 
all my bills I want them to be strong so
they<00:01:15.110> can<00:01:15.259> what's<00:01:15.440> and<00:01:15.709> a<00:01:15.950> hard<00:01:16.250> landing<00:01:16.610> or<00:01:16.759> a

00:01:16.779 --> 00:01:16.789 
they can what's and a hard landing or a

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:20.980 
they can what's and a hard landing or a
crash<00:01:17.030> because<00:01:17.300> you<00:01:17.539> know<00:01:17.690> all<00:01:19.240> RC<00:01:20.240> planes<00:01:20.569> are

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:20.990 
crash because you know all RC planes are

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:22.630 
crash because you know all RC planes are
going<00:01:21.229> to<00:01:21.319> have<00:01:21.500> a<00:01:21.800> hard<00:01:22.099> landing<00:01:22.490> or

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640 
going to have a hard landing or

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.790 
going to have a hard landing or
something<00:01:23.000> at<00:01:23.119> some<00:01:23.300> point<00:01:23.630> to<00:01:24.470> build<00:01:24.679> your

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:24.800 
something at some point to build your

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.940 
something at some point to build your
plane<00:01:25.069> super<00:01:25.490> light<00:01:25.640> and<00:01:25.670> super<00:01:26.060> flimsy<00:01:26.300> is<00:01:26.950> in

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:27.950 
plane super light and super flimsy is in

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.240 
plane super light and super flimsy is in
my<00:01:28.130> opinion<00:01:29.440> you<00:01:30.440> know<00:01:30.560> you're<00:01:30.740> taken<00:01:31.069> you

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 
my opinion you know you're taken you

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.900 
my opinion you know you're taken you
just<00:01:31.459> taking<00:01:31.729> a<00:01:31.789> risk<00:01:32.319> but<00:01:33.700> maybe<00:01:34.700> they're

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:34.910 
just taking a risk but maybe they're

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:39.880 
just taking a risk but maybe they're
easy<00:01:35.090> to<00:01:35.270> repair<00:01:35.569> I<00:01:35.630> don't<00:01:35.929> know<00:01:36.039> but<00:01:38.770> you<00:01:39.770> know

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:39.890 
easy to repair I don't know but you know

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.820 
easy to repair I don't know but you know
for<00:01:40.069> my<00:01:40.250> my<00:01:40.849> experience<00:01:41.780> it's<00:01:42.259> easier<00:01:42.709> to

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:42.830 
for my my experience it's easier to

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:44.320 
for my my experience it's easier to
build<00:01:42.979> this<00:01:43.190> way<00:01:43.429> because<00:01:43.640> you<00:01:43.970> just<00:01:44.149> have<00:01:44.300> a

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:44.330 
build this way because you just have a

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:47.979 
build this way because you just have a
stronger<00:01:44.630> plane<00:01:44.979> but<00:01:45.979> you<00:01:46.099> know<00:01:46.220> just<00:01:46.989> just

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:47.989 
stronger plane but you know just just

00:01:47.989 --> 00:01:49.839 
stronger plane but you know just just
little<00:01:48.229> ideas<00:01:48.560> and<00:01:48.830> we're<00:01:49.009> all<00:01:49.130> sharing<00:01:49.610> ideas

00:01:49.839 --> 00:01:49.849 
little ideas and we're all sharing ideas
