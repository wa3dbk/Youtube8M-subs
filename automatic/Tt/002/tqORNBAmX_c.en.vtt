 you want to participate you can time 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:19.229
 give odds of winning book during 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:21.180
 marathon on my twitter on twitter 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.920
 and there in the event of facebook that will have 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.689
 a link down here will happen 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.220
 some in reeds some jokes and 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:28.439
 some challenges that we are doing 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.369
 throughout the marathon being worth many 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.079
 kisses 

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.909
 now if everything still also confusing in the 

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.860
 head I'll try to explain the way 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:37.500
 as clear as possible this marathon will 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:40.170
 lasts two days and she will have two teams 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.329
 have to marathon on Saturday with me 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.490
 be the unicorn type and who to participate 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.790
 on Sunday with the victor will be the type 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.640
 robot and if you want to do 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:51.110
 for 48 hours of course you can but 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.360
 it is important that in the form of 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.350
 you choose one of the teams that 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.970
 you want to stay 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.560
 It's logical that you did not choose because 

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:58.130
 occur are much more wonderful than 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.960
 values 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.970
 Then you ask me to formulate this 

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.890
 victor and I reply from popular here 

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:05.390
 underneath the box of discretion is from 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.740
 of this form that we will know 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.450
 everyone who is participating in the 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.740
 marathon for us to be lucky 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.460
 gifts that we receive other 

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:11.930
 publishers 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:13.220
 so if you have to participate, it's a lot 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.200
 important that you fulfill the 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.910
 form and confirm your presence there 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.100
