00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:33.270
 hello girls I find you 

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:35.550
 today to share with you what 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.800
 that I took the neck to vote in Cairo so 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.110
 the first article I bought this 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.610
 product there so it's a deodorant of the 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.980
 mark the little Marseille so me 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.750
 I've never tested this water there then 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.410
 these are hobbies and his senses and 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:49.440
 aluminum 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.879
 and it's alcohol-free and it smells like flower 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.180
 orange 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:57.600
 so at the level of the smell it seems very 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.890
 good did not really fix it 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.050
 feel very very good tone frankly that 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.360
 feels very good it smells strong and it's 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.800
 pretty sweet enough so here's my guy 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.120
 see to test I'll see if it's 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.920
 effective or not between cases I you in 

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:10.440
 will talk again that's for sure I wanted 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.150
 shows a little closer and so at this 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:12.870
 level there at the price level these two 

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:15.450
 for the price of one 

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:16.920
 so to know that a cost 3 euros 10 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:18.300
 so I got both for 3 euros 10 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.470
 so it's nice it's like we had 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:22.560
 the least 50% 

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.930
 so frankly so I have this then 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.820
 that I took is this product of 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:30.659
 at bourjois 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:32.549
 so it's a lip lacquer so it's 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.570
 a melting and airy texture with 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.200
 a matte finish 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:45.119
 I took the lead the shade 07 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:47.759
 nudists and that's how it is so here is the 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:49.880
 basic price of this product there it me 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.899
 seemed like it was 9 euros and a few 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:53.729
 I do not know all the ways I play but 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:56.640
 at what price he is paid and at which he is 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.560
 at the base but I paid them at 6 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.920
 euros 93 so it's still a 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.719
 price but now it's been a while 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:05.100
 that I wanted to have one I had 

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:08.509
 taken 1 it seems like these same as 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:11.580
 I took julie during the swap 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:13.500
 it's the same one I took and it's 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:17.340
 you're right I'm reading a smell not 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.960
 very nice 69 'race and chemical well 

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.940
 sure it does not stay on the lips so that 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.810
 go but here's five hundred a smell enough 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:26.130
 chemical that is not very nice 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.440
 on the other hand the color I find 

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:30.030
 really very very very very beautiful so 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.440
 at the swatch level on the picture 

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.180
 it's really the rendering you have 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:34.470
 on the lips 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:36.060
 so frankly it's really a beautiful 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:37.620
 returned after 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:41.099
 it does not stay when you eat a sa 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:42.300
 apart but otherwise here I find that 

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:43.950
 it's pretty cool so I wanted 

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:46.830
 take several colors and then after 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.660
 I got resigned myself to taking 

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:50.130
 only one color for not this is at 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.959
 case I would be disappointed in case that's me 

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:53.489
 would not like but here I took this 

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:55.380
 color if I would not go back 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:58.019
 other colors even if I like 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:00.360
 I took this mouthwash from home 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:02.280
 colgate so it's the colgate plate 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.690
 souplex I do not know so it's without 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:05.459
 alcohol is not a mouthwash that 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.310
 you use blood mixed with water there 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:10.170
 is already cut with water so voila 

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:11.610
 I had more and I wanted to 

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.680
 take it because I use thread 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:14.970
 dental and I noticed that when we 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.680
 uses dental floss and has not 

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:18.750
 no hunger not include thin bread 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.280
 do not do a bang just after 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:22.019
 the gum I think he reacts 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.340
 a little bad sometimes I have ace infects 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:24.569
 at the level of people if I'm wrong I 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:27.720
 tend to leave me crazy with the 

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:29.310
 floss and blow the gum she 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.230
 swells and their drawings a little bit at 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:32.549
 tooth level and it's annoying because 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:34.620
 that when you eat you hurt art 

00:03:32.549 --> 00:03:37.739
 and that's so it's pretty boring 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:39.269
 and suddenly they needed us to 

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:41.190
 base had taken jal took'm here 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:42.660
 and the blue then after I rested so 

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:44.630
 it's not very expensive blow by 

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:46.950
 compared to the coupon you are responsible 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:49.709
 0.92 so I think it costs 5 euros 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:51.390
 and some normal so that's it 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:52.950
 frankly that's a good plan but 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:54.660
 I'm glad I took it then 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:57.920
 I think the best plan is the most interesting 

00:03:54.660 --> 00:04:00.750
 it's this one 

00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:02.730
 so this good plan there in fact it's a 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:04.799
 box like that that is all packed 

00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:07.069
 all around and it comes all three 

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:10.880
 products together in fact for the purchase 

00:04:07.069 --> 00:04:12.930
 This duo crem it offers you 

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:15.810
 eye makeup remover cleansing 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:18.239
 smoothly to the eyes so he is 

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:21.150
 no bifff azÃ© this makeup remover there this 

00:04:18.239 --> 00:04:22.350
 cleanser the year not biphasic it is 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:23.639
 hypoallergenic so it can be 

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:25.080
 really nice tested under control 

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:27.810
 Ophthalmology at the site 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:29.580
 I paid three euros 77 for these three 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:32.010
 products so frankly it's really 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:33.389
 cool for didier really ends 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:34.830
 I was happy so I'm going to 

00:04:33.389 --> 00:04:39.600
 show how cream looks 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:42.060
 so that's how she looks so 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:44.610
 this is a moisturizer and 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:46.409
 magician it's a day care then you're 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:47.129
 buys sebum regulating agents 

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:49.559
 hydrated 

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:51.509
 if the normal and mixed pop so 

00:04:49.559 --> 00:04:53.339
 this is to put it in backup is 

00:04:51.509 --> 00:04:54.449
 like that when I finish all 

00:04:53.339 --> 00:04:56.939
 all the creams that I have 

00:04:54.449 --> 00:04:58.159
 will really use it for cream 

00:04:56.939 --> 00:05:01.949
 clip day 

00:04:58.159 --> 00:05:04.199
 by cons there is no xpf it's a 

00:05:01.949 --> 00:05:06.929
 but otherwise little damage here 

00:05:04.199 --> 00:05:08.339
 frankly against it is to use 

00:05:06.929 --> 00:05:11.069
 these ice creams used it from 

00:05:08.339 --> 00:05:13.229
 25 years old so I'm 25 years old so 

00:05:11.069 --> 00:05:16.439
 it's the age that recommended it's between 

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:18.629
 25 and 55 so that's it if you want 

00:05:16.439 --> 00:05:20.129
 really have an effect you look at 

00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:22.879
 behind products from diadermine 

00:05:20.129 --> 00:05:25.559
 you sometimes have the small ruler 

00:05:22.879 --> 00:05:26.939
 at what age should we start it and at what 

00:05:25.559 --> 00:05:28.379
 agency or pastime our kingdom 

00:05:26.939 --> 00:05:30.269
 so here are the girls I have you 

00:05:28.379 --> 00:05:32.550
 presented all the purchases I made 

00:05:30.269 --> 00:05:34.379
 the beauty specials at leclerc 

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:36.149
 so it's true that usually I 

00:05:34.379 --> 00:05:38.699
 tendency to make water there is big 

00:05:36.149 --> 00:05:43.050
 but then I thought I was here 

00:05:38.699 --> 00:05:44.909
 filled my bag a bag a bag leclerc is 

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:46.789
 jelly well well well filled and 

00:05:44.909 --> 00:05:49.139
 frankly after I said myself good 

00:05:46.789 --> 00:05:51.119
 I started to pull I had taken 

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:52.709
 Dry shampoos from Baptist but 

00:05:51.119 --> 00:05:54.749
 as I do not use much of the shot 

00:05:52.709 --> 00:05:57.029
 my sleeve and less - the fat roots 

00:05:54.749 --> 00:05:59.039
 that before I am really very very 

00:05:57.029 --> 00:06:00.389
 rarely so here's really if I do 

00:05:59.039 --> 00:06:02.909
 a hairstyle and that I kept him from 

00:06:00.389 --> 00:06:04.079
 volume I'm going to use it but that's it 

00:06:02.909 --> 00:06:06.029
 so I thought it was not worth it 

00:06:04.079 --> 00:06:08.009
 but hey shampoos 500 to 2 euros and 

00:06:06.029 --> 00:06:09.479
 call which is nice enough I wanted 

00:06:08.009 --> 00:06:10.679
 also takes me the style of the masks for 

00:06:09.479 --> 00:06:12.360
 the evenings when I have a little bit laziness 

00:06:10.679 --> 00:06:14.429
 to go and remove my makeup to the sink 

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:16.979
 but Stephanie told me she told me 

00:06:14.429 --> 00:06:18.329
 someone was 2 and we had 

00:06:16.979 --> 00:06:20.069
 put one in the next package that I 

00:06:18.329 --> 00:06:21.360
 will receive and I wanted you 

00:06:20.069 --> 00:06:22.800
 ask if you're interested that I 

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:24.149
 you film the parcels that I receive from the 

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:26.639
 part of stephanie I can make you 

00:06:24.149 --> 00:06:28.639
 videos it can be nice video 

00:06:26.639 --> 00:06:30.119
 finding or boxing colic 

00:06:28.639 --> 00:06:32.579
 that she sends me 

00:06:30.119 --> 00:06:34.499
 so here we are doing a kind of swap 

00:06:32.579 --> 00:06:36.659
 No gift papers and 100 little words 

00:06:34.499 --> 00:06:38.009
 but suddenly I think it's 

00:06:36.659 --> 00:06:39.659
 really very interesting even if you 

00:06:38.009 --> 00:06:40.800
 know girls or if you do 

00:06:39.659 --> 00:06:42.779
 videos you know others 

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:44.039
 girl who make it if you can you 

00:06:42.779 --> 00:06:46.080
 send parcels like that from time to time 

00:06:44.039 --> 00:06:47.759
 empty cupboards time and even 

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:49.650
 gift inside it can really 

00:06:47.759 --> 00:06:51.629
 frankly cool and suddenly all 

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:54.449
 month of the blow we all the amounts sees 

00:06:51.629 --> 00:06:57.780
 two parcels a month that's a lot 

00:06:54.449 --> 00:06:59.490
 sure but frankly that's what 

00:06:57.780 --> 00:07:01.199
 it's really really very cool 

00:06:59.490 --> 00:07:03.960
 it allows you to discover a lot of 

00:07:01.199 --> 00:07:06.509
 things at a lot cheaper and that's 

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:07.979
 really very very profitable like as 

00:07:06.509 --> 00:07:09.629
 frankly it's really profitable 

00:07:07.979 --> 00:07:11.009
 and if you love tested a lot 

00:07:09.629 --> 00:07:11.870
 a lot of things frankly that's 

00:07:11.009 --> 00:07:14.340
 made for you too 

00:07:11.870 --> 00:07:15.870

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:25.909
 so here he was linked to the next 

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:25.909
 for a next video hi
