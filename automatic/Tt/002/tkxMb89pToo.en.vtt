00:06:23.340 --> 00:06:25.279 
I really got to say about this fight I
mean<00:06:23.580> I<00:06:23.669> think<00:06:23.699> it's<00:06:24.120> kind<00:06:24.539> of<00:06:24.629> a<00:06:24.750> waste<00:06:24.960> I

00:06:25.279 --> 00:06:25.289 
mean I think it's kind of a waste I

00:06:25.289 --> 00:06:27.830 
mean I think it's kind of a waste I
think<00:06:25.500> the<00:06:25.710> ghost<00:06:26.430> world<00:06:26.759> was<00:06:27.029> way<00:06:27.330> out<00:06:27.599> of<00:06:27.629> his

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:27.840 
think the ghost world was way out of his

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:30.589 
think the ghost world was way out of his
step<00:06:28.110> he's<00:06:28.349> way<00:06:29.069> I<00:06:29.400> mean<00:06:29.729> he's<00:06:30.000> way<00:06:30.240> off<00:06:30.270> the

00:06:30.589 --> 00:06:30.599 
step he's way I mean he's way off the

00:06:30.599 --> 00:06:33.110 
step he's way I mean he's way off the
mark<00:06:30.840> I<00:06:31.169> don't<00:06:31.889> even<00:06:32.099> know<00:06:32.370> why<00:06:32.580> he<00:06:32.820> would<00:06:33.000> even

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:33.120 
mark I don't even know why he would even

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:34.110 
mark I don't even know why he would even
really<00:06:33.599> one<00:06:33.810> of

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:34.120 
really one of

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:37.140 
really one of
forward<00:06:34.630> right<00:06:34.870> now<00:06:35.199> I<00:06:35.500> think<00:06:35.740> he<00:06:36.580> needed<00:06:36.850> at

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:37.150 
forward right now I think he needed at

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:40.409 
forward right now I think he needed at
least<00:06:37.360> two<00:06:37.810> more<00:06:38.020> fights<00:06:38.350> at<00:06:38.530> 147<00:06:39.270> before<00:06:40.270> he

00:06:40.409 --> 00:06:40.419 
least two more fights at 147 before he

00:06:40.419 --> 00:06:42.629 
least two more fights at 147 before he
could<00:06:40.570> think<00:06:40.810> about<00:06:40.930> fighting<00:06:41.380> for<00:06:41.740> it<00:06:41.889> but

00:06:42.629 --> 00:06:42.639 
could think about fighting for it but

00:06:42.639 --> 00:06:47.040 
could think about fighting for it but
hey<00:06:43.020> it's<00:06:44.020> the<00:06:44.169> way<00:06:44.290> the<00:06:44.440> game<00:06:44.650> goes<00:06:44.680> um<00:06:46.050> so

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:47.050 
hey it's the way the game goes um so

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:49.290 
hey it's the way the game goes um so
yeah<00:06:47.430> let<00:06:48.430> me<00:06:48.520> know<00:06:48.610> what<00:06:48.699> you<00:06:48.820> guys<00:06:48.970> think<00:06:49.180> of

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:51.270 
yeah let me know what you guys think of
this<00:06:49.419> Batman<00:06:49.900> I<00:06:50.080> think<00:06:50.470> that<00:06:50.680> the<00:06:50.860> Robert<00:06:51.220> the

00:06:51.270 --> 00:06:51.280 
this Batman I think that the Robert the

00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:52.830 
this Batman I think that the Robert the
ghost<00:06:51.310> ghirls<00:06:51.790> can<00:06:51.940> get<00:06:52.090> stopped<00:06:52.389> late<00:06:52.630> in<00:06:52.750> the

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:52.840 
ghost ghirls can get stopped late in the

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:55.680 
ghost ghirls can get stopped late in the
fight<00:06:53.050> I<00:06:53.229> stay<00:06:53.470> around<00:06:53.650> a<00:06:53.770> 9th<00:06:53.979> 10th<00:06:54.340> round<00:06:54.690> I

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:55.690 
fight I stay around a 9th 10th round I

00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:57.930 
fight I stay around a 9th 10th round I
say<00:06:56.650> he'll<00:06:56.860> gets<00:06:57.130> in<00:06:57.370> and<00:06:57.520> get<00:06:57.639> stopped

00:06:57.930 --> 00:06:57.940 
say he'll gets in and get stopped

00:06:57.940 --> 00:06:59.520 
say he'll gets in and get stopped
because<00:06:58.270> his<00:06:58.389> corner<00:06:58.780> will<00:06:58.930> stop<00:06:59.139> the<00:06:59.320> fight

00:06:59.520 --> 00:06:59.530 
because his corner will stop the fight

00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:02.610 
because his corner will stop the fight
to<00:07:00.490> be<00:07:00.639> honest<00:07:00.910> with<00:07:01.060> you<00:07:01.120> I<00:07:01.389> see<00:07:02.199> him<00:07:02.410> getting

00:07:02.610 --> 00:07:02.620 
to be honest with you I see him getting

00:07:02.620 --> 00:07:08.400 
to be honest with you I see him getting
beat<00:07:02.949> down<00:07:03.479> worse<00:07:04.889> than<00:07:05.970> and<00:07:06.970> this<00:07:07.080> is<00:07:08.080> just<00:07:08.260> my
