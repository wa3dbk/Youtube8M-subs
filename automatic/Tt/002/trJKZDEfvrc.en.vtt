think<00:02:16.490> about<00:02:16.580> it<00:02:16.930> so<00:02:17.930> many<00:02:18.020> animals<00:02:18.470> depend<00:02:18.890> on

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040

for<00:02:21.920> example<00:02:22.340> eat<00:02:22.520> insects<00:02:23.200> so<00:02:24.200> do<00:02:24.260> many

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
for example eat insects so do many

for example eat insects so do many

animals won't have enough to eat and

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.180 
animals won't have enough to eat and
that'll<00:02:37.940> hit<00:02:38.030> biodiversity<00:02:38.750> very<00:02:38.960> hard<00:02:39.290> of

that'll hit biodiversity very hard of

that'll hit biodiversity very hard of

course that's exactly what we've done by

course that's exactly what we've done by

said that gardening is a way of showing
that<00:03:35.900> you<00:03:36.050> believe<00:03:36.380> in<00:03:36.530> tomorrow<00:03:36.890> and<00:03:37.489> I<00:03:37.610> think

that you believe in tomorrow and I think

that you believe in tomorrow and I think
that's<00:03:37.940> never<00:03:38.120> been<00:03:38.330> more<00:03:38.510> true<00:03:38.570> than<00:03:38.810> today

that's never been more true than today

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:41.050 
that's never been more true than today
because<00:03:39.709> the<00:03:39.860> way<00:03:40.070> we<00:03:40.280> garden<00:03:40.640> the<00:03:40.790> way<00:03:40.910> we

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060 
because the way we garden the way we

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:42.820 
because the way we garden the way we
create<00:03:41.239> places<00:03:41.840> like<00:03:42.019> meadows<00:03:42.380> is<00:03:42.590> going<00:03:42.769> to

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:42.830 
create places like meadows is going to

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:46.540 
create places like meadows is going to
determine<00:03:43.160> what<00:03:43.489> life<00:03:43.700> looks<00:03:43.910> like<00:03:44.060> tomorrow
