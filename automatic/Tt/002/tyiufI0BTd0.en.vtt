00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.960
 and the food chains in a 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:14.730
 ecosystem the living beings of a 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:17.640
 ecosystem feed on each other 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:21.210
 and what is called a chain is formed 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:24.259
 food at the base are the 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:29.570
 plants that produce their own food 

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:32.930
 of the plants the animals are fed 

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:36.590
 of the herbivorous animals are fed 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:40.190
 the carnivores or predators 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:44.000
 there are also the omnivorous animals that 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:46.520
 they consume both plants and animals 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.750
 the plants since they make their 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:52.970
 own food are named after 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:56.260
 producers the animals as 

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:59.260
 they feed on other living beings they are called 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.260
 consumers 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.680
 Y 

00:01:12.829 --> 00:01:19.649
 in addition to food relations in 

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:23.399
 an ecosystem the relationships of 

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:25.729
 the competition and cooperation 

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:29.670
 animals that live in an ecosystem 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:34.110
 can compete for food or for 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:38.220
 the females for example the lion the 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:42.810
 hyenas the cheetahs compete for 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:45.780
 herbivorous animals of the savanna also 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:50.190
 Plants can compete for light 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:53.880
 they need to make their food 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:57.179
 for example the trees in the jungle are 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:02:00.869
 so big because there are so many 

00:01:57.179 --> 00:02:04.230
 the youngest ones perish at the 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:07.560
 do not receive sunlight 

00:02:04.230 --> 00:02:11.310
 but when living beings collaborate and 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:13.100
 they help each other a relationship of 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.950
 cooperation 

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:19.850
 so the animals are grouped to 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:24.860
 defend against the predators the jjoo 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:28.460
 the zebras the fish schools other 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:31.780
 like the hermit crab makes the 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:35.720
 anemone moves and tentacles 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:39.370
 poisonous from this prevent them from hunting 

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.370
 crab predators 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.260
 Y
