00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.260
 finally we have in our hands the 

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:07.600
 nokia lumia 

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:11.020
 1925 the new franchise terminal of the 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:14.290
 Finns with which they update the 

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:16.990
 range and everything that is proposed to us by 920 

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:21.840
 is the main change comes in the 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:21.840
 design over the entire terminal frame 

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:29.300
 analyzed in aluminum the unibody design 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:32.630
 aesthetically it 's pretty pretty all 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:34.130
 this black finish very conflictive in 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:35.720
 the back if it stays in 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:38.420
 polycarbonate 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:41.450
 is let's say another sign identity that 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:44.900
 had had the lumia previously 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:47.880
 but how do we see this framework if it's from a 

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:50.340
 pretty distanced material 

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:54.540
 my brother falls very well especially 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:56.370
 because they've got 22 pretty things 

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:59.520
 important 

00:00:56.370 --> 00:01:02.489
 with a little bit of the rest at the end of 920 it's 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:04.260
 much lighter we have already lost 50 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.630
 grams from the last terminal 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.880
 franchise of nokia and especially also 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.850
 it's rather narrower is not the most 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.790
 narrow market but it really does 

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:18.479
 that the 4.5-inch terminal falls on 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:20.820
 hands really legs is narrower 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.580
 at the ends that in the center start 

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:27.630
 its curvature is so characteristic of 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:30.810
 those of the high-end because let's say 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.479
 that the whole gamut the whole logic of the 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:36.330
 optics all the mechanics of optics 

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:38.610
 occupies enough space and is still 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:41.970
 one of the strong answers of nokia 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.729
 with 125 aluminum in which they claim 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:46.560
 have more for another more cloudy day 

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:48.960
 they claim that optics is even better 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.470
 in low light conditions and so 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.759
 So let's see a version 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:56.130
 improved from the law to good performance 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:02:00.539
 Photographic giving 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:03.290
 the screen very well 45 inches in 

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:05.610
 amoled technology 

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:08.950
 and estate 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:12.330
 about amoled they build what they have 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:16.030
 called click black in which they claim 

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:17.890
 In addition to providing bar have good 

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:21.190
 performance in autonomy that offers 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:25.300
 that offers the two screens amoled well 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:27.910
 a remarkable improvement what are the 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:31.959
 black when displaying images on 

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:34.350
 terminal will die that the two lack well 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:36.570
 It is an improvement 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:38.580
 our teeth and then let's say the 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:41.000
 rest of features purely 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.000
 techniques 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:48.980
 it's pretty much dual-core continuist the 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:51.370
 micro of which with about 5 gigahertz 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:54.049
 a gig of ram in terms of power 

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:55.819
 because it is not at the level of 

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:57.409
 franchisees of the brands these 

00:02:55.819 --> 00:02:59.239
 platforms partly because the windows 

00:02:57.409 --> 00:03:01.099
 with 8 establishes the action of 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:04.099
 limitations in this aspect to day of 

00:03:01.099 --> 00:03:05.989
 today but the truth is that everything 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:09.530
 we have tested with the terminal in 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:11.810
 fluency terms 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:15.590
 It is impeccable mobile phone 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:17.780
 system without any important port the 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:20.540
 Novelties in photography do not end in 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:23.170
 the improvement of optics but the 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.170
 software 

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:30.050
 we see here called do not want more camera 

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:33.420
 offers themes 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:36.209
 news regarding what 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:38.489
 is everything related to processing 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:42.470
 back of the image 

00:03:38.489 --> 00:03:42.470
 if we click here the options 

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:49.400
 not that it is sea camera we will see that there is a 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:52.070
 lots of options some already present 

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.270
 and other novelties regarding what 

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:57.100
 we can do with photography how 

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:59.650
 remove objects that move 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:03.970
 choose the best photo or change the 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:05.740
 faces if we are doing portraits etc 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:07.270
 of course to try a little more 

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:08.800
 thoroughly keep in mind that when 

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:11.800
 phones and the functionality that triggers 

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:13.960
 ten and ten images we will reduce the 

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:16.000
 resolution that by default is 8 17 

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:19.090
 megapixels but in that in that 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.730
 characteristic is reduced to 5 in the first 

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:23.490
 Very good terminal impressions very good 

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:25.690
 very well designed very well finished 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:29.590
 fits very well in hand have been palliated 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:30.960
 enough of the objections we could 

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:33.930
 pose 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:35.789
 at the moment excellent and good one thing 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:37.800
 that if we lose the way in favor of 

00:04:35.789 --> 00:04:39.360
 lightness and thinness 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:42.330
 is that you no longer have the wireless charge 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:44.639
 native you have to do it with one with one 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:45.880
 housing that is really hooked to 

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:49.450
 these 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:53.639
 together that the phone offers and 

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:56.219
 that has no microsd expansion 

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:57.749
 which in the 16 GB version 

00:04:56.219 --> 00:05:00.810
 probably yes he missed it 

00:04:57.749 --> 00:05:02.430
 the 32 days that will apparently arrive in 

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:06.120
 exclusively with Vodafone for 

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:08.639
 we are probably looking forward to it 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:12.419
 can see the test thoroughly but 

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:15.960
 while what we discussed a very good 

00:05:12.419 --> 00:05:20.270
 update of 1920 in this nokia 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:20.270
 Lumia 925
