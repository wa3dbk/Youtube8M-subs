I just got to weigh myself and I am 174

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.770 
I just got to weigh myself and I am 174
pounds<00:00:10.710> even<00:00:12.290> so<00:00:13.290> um<00:00:14.280> he<00:00:14.940> has<00:00:15.030> a<00:00:15.059> game<00:00:15.420> couple

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:15.780 
pounds even so um he has a game couple

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.080 
pounds even so um he has a game couple
ounces<00:00:16.070> but<00:00:17.070> I've<00:00:17.250> already<00:00:17.460> told<00:00:17.760> you<00:00:17.940> guys

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:18.090 
ounces but I've already told you guys

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.679 
ounces but I've already told you guys
that<00:00:18.150> more<00:00:18.990> than<00:00:19.020> likely<00:00:19.140> i'm<00:00:19.590> going<00:00:19.619> to<00:00:20.689> be

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
that more than likely i'm going to be

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.650 
that more than likely i'm going to be
fluctuating<00:00:22.350> in<00:00:22.710> weight<00:00:23.609> so<00:00:24.210> far<00:00:24.449> it's<00:00:24.570> only

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
fluctuating in weight so far it's only

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.870 
fluctuating in weight so far it's only
been<00:00:24.840> counted<00:00:25.619> so<00:00:25.949> I<00:00:26.189> guess<00:00:26.460> that's<00:00:26.609> a<00:00:26.760> good

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:26.880 
been counted so I guess that's a good

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.240 
been counted so I guess that's a good
thing<00:00:27.019> usually<00:00:28.019> pyramids<00:00:28.680> time<00:00:28.980> I'm

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
thing usually pyramids time I'm

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.089 
thing usually pyramids time I'm
fluctuating<00:00:30.029> a<00:00:30.119> couple<00:00:30.449> of<00:00:30.539> pounds<00:00:30.750> so<00:00:31.410> I'm

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
fluctuating a couple of pounds so I'm

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.190 
fluctuating a couple of pounds so I'm
assuming<00:00:32.340> that<00:00:32.759> my<00:00:32.880> workout<00:00:33.300> is<00:00:33.510> helping<00:00:34.020> me

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:34.200 
assuming that my workout is helping me

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.690 
assuming that my workout is helping me
maintain<00:00:34.969> just<00:00:35.969> a<00:00:36.090> few<00:00:36.300> ounces<00:00:36.480> rather<00:00:37.230> than

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:37.700 
maintain just a few ounces rather than

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:42.440
