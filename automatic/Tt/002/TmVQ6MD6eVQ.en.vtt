 hi hello killion and good today 

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:07.849
 I bring you a map that the truth is 

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:10.549
 great and they will say good but what map is 

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:12.169
 It is a map based on a very 

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:15.860
 acclaimed game that was called I am 

00:00:12.169 --> 00:00:17.480
 infinity and good apart from that as 

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:21.080
 you can see we have main karts here and 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:23.510
 rails and so on because it's for 0.8 

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.130
 zero point and any good build 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:27.500
 the five that would be the last and the one 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:29.960
 it works better and there goes a cart 

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.830
 alone forever alone or rather I am the 

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.679
 forever alone 

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:35.719
 and I do not know it's pretty cool obviously 

00:00:33.679 --> 00:00:38.989
 leave the description in the description 

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:40.699
 did and leave on the page and fleur of more 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:43.460
 well and below I'll leave the page 

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:46.039

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:49.480
 download directly but the link 

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:52.329
 I will not put it in what I know 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:55.390
 here directly because when not 

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:57.520
 I want to avoid problems and ok took me 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:00.340
 my car and I want to get up there is 

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.940
 we are up and we moved forward there 

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:02.739
 good 

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:04.629
 is more we are going to put in third 

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:07.869
 ok person 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:09.660
 coming back to the game and we are here you see 

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:12.880
 pretty cool really see nothing more 

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:16.180
 it's all a city is has never played 

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.770
 of several ok but for the videos that 

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.220
 come to see then actually that is 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.290
 identical 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:24.680
 very identical and not enough 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:28.940
 Great to see nothing else is like a city 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:32.480
 air something like that and it looks amazing the 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:34.880
 I play both the game and the map 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:37.310
 It's great and nothing really I hope that 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.590
