00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:10.490 
just fueling the lantern the right way

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:13.100 
just fueling the lantern the right way
since<00:00:11.490> the<00:00:11.639> last<00:00:11.790> way<00:00:12.000> it<00:00:12.179> was<00:00:12.540> a<00:00:12.570> little<00:00:12.840> loud

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
since the last way it was a little loud

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.519 
since the last way it was a little loud
a<00:00:13.469> little<00:00:13.620> sketchy<00:00:14.070> because<00:00:14.340> it<00:00:14.700> wasn't

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:15.529 
a little sketchy because it wasn't

00:00:15.529 --> 00:00:19.490 
a little sketchy because it wasn't
proper<00:00:16.730> like<00:00:17.730> we're<00:00:18.630> doing<00:00:18.720> it<00:00:18.960> right<00:00:19.170> but

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
proper like we're doing it right but

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:21.830 
proper like we're doing it right but
this<00:00:19.650> is<00:00:19.800> doing<00:00:20.010> it<00:00:20.130> better<00:00:20.310> which<00:00:21.090> all<00:00:21.480> you<00:00:21.660> do

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
this is doing it better which all you do

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.720 
this is doing it better which all you do
is<00:00:21.930> just<00:00:21.960> leave<00:00:22.199> a<00:00:22.289> giant<00:00:22.640> you<00:00:23.640> know

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
is just leave a giant you know

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
that is a cross which is second because

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:13.900 
that is a cross which is second because
you<00:02:12.410> can<00:02:12.560> you<00:02:12.800> can<00:02:12.950> kind<00:02:13.520> of<00:02:13.580> tell<00:02:13.760> the

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:13.910 
you can you can kind of tell the

you can you can kind of tell the
difference<00:02:14.180> between<00:02:14.240> them<00:02:15.020> just<00:02:15.320> by<00:02:15.470> the<00:02:15.530> fact

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
difference between them just by the fact

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.340 
difference between them just by the fact
that<00:02:16.010> if<00:02:16.550> you<00:02:16.640> look<00:02:16.790> across<00:02:16.910> it<00:02:17.450> has<00:02:17.630> all<00:02:18.110> if

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:18.350 
that if you look across it has all if

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.340 
that if you look across it has all if
you<00:02:18.440> look<00:02:18.590> at<00:02:18.680> the<00:02:18.770> sign<00:02:19.550> it<00:02:19.970> had<00:02:20.540> the<00:02:20.690> two<00:02:20.870> ends

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 
you look at the sign it had the two ends

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:25.480 
you look at the sign it had the two ends
and<00:02:21.820> you<00:02:23.620> just<00:02:24.620> pretty<00:02:24.950> much<00:02:25.070> going<00:02:25.310> to<00:02:25.370> match

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:25.490 
and you just pretty much going to match

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:26.950 
and you just pretty much going to match
up<00:02:25.520> the<00:02:25.670> same<00:02:25.910> letters<00:02:26.270> with<00:02:26.450> all<00:02:26.660> the<00:02:26.840> other

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
gliders just to find out and pretty much

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:31.900 
gliders just to find out and pretty much
you<00:02:30.590> just<00:02:30.620> going<00:02:30.800> to<00:02:30.860> follow<00:02:31.010> the<00:02:31.190> wisp<00:02:31.370> I<00:02:31.820> do

ahead<00:03:06.020> like<00:03:06.230> like<00:03:06.620> what's<00:03:06.830> happening<00:03:06.950> right

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:07.190 
ahead like like what's happening right

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:08.560 
ahead like like what's happening right
here<00:03:07.310> because<00:03:07.820> it's<00:03:08.030> not<00:03:08.209> really<00:03:08.420> getting

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:08.570 
here because it's not really getting

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:11.170 
here because it's not really getting
smaller<00:03:09.080> until<00:03:09.860> we<00:03:09.980> actually<00:03:10.100> get<00:03:10.370> past<00:03:11.030> the

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
smaller until we actually get past the

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:12.970 
smaller until we actually get past the
candy<00:03:11.690> shop<00:03:11.870> but<00:03:12.110> that's<00:03:12.260> understandable

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
candy shop but that's understandable

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:17.229 
candy shop but that's understandable
because<00:03:13.220> it's<00:03:13.519> like<00:03:13.760> a<00:03:13.970> few<00:03:14.480> feet<00:03:14.660> away<00:03:15.190> but<00:03:16.239> we

00:03:17.229 --> 00:03:17.239 
because it's like a few feet away but we

00:03:17.239 --> 00:03:20.290 
because it's like a few feet away but we
did<00:03:18.070> we<00:03:19.070> did<00:03:19.220> get<00:03:19.280> the<00:03:19.400> West<00:03:19.580> bin<00:03:19.820> but<00:03:20.030> we<00:03:20.120> did

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:20.300 
did we did get the West bin but we did

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:25.449 
did we did get the West bin but we did
have<00:03:20.450> a<00:03:20.510> problem<00:03:21.080> for<00:03:21.769> the<00:03:21.830> fact<00:03:22.070> that<00:03:22.330> we<00:03:24.459> we

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:25.459 
have a problem for the fact that we we

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:28.210 
have a problem for the fact that we we
get<00:03:25.670> the<00:03:26.060> half<00:03:26.300> the<00:03:26.480> Easter<00:03:26.720> I'd<00:03:26.840> done<00:03:27.110> but<00:03:27.920> as

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:28.220 
get the half the Easter I'd done but as

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:30.820 
get the half the Easter I'd done but as
used<00:03:29.150> as<00:03:29.420> you<00:03:29.630> took<00:03:29.810> as<00:03:30.019> you<00:03:30.290> can<00:03:30.410> tell<00:03:30.590> on<00:03:30.739> the

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:30.830 
used as you took as you can tell on the

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:33.100 
used as you took as you can tell on the
bottom<00:03:31.160> left<00:03:31.550> you<00:03:32.060> can<00:03:32.090> see<00:03:32.239> the<00:03:32.840> number

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:33.110 
bottom left you can see the number

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:36.009 
bottom left you can see the number
change<00:03:33.380> from<00:03:33.560> 7-10<00:03:34.269> we<00:03:35.269> should<00:03:35.450> actually<00:03:35.660> did

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:36.019 
change from 7-10 we should actually did

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:38.920 
change from 7-10 we should actually did
that<00:03:36.340> beforehand<00:03:37.340> before<00:03:37.850> you<00:03:38.390> know<00:03:38.510> the<00:03:38.750> wisp

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:38.930 
that beforehand before you know the wisp

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:40.930 
that beforehand before you know the wisp
actually<00:03:39.320> entered<00:03:39.650> because<00:03:39.980> one<00:03:40.640> if<00:03:40.760> we're

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:40.940 
actually entered because one if we're

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:42.580 
actually entered because one if we're
slowing<00:03:41.269> down<00:03:41.390> time<00:03:41.660> the<00:03:41.900> whispers<00:03:42.260> going<00:03:42.500> to

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:42.590 
slowing down time the whispers going to

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:45.610 
slowing down time the whispers going to
go<00:03:43.160> inside<00:03:43.880> the<00:03:43.940> gallo<00:03:44.390> so<00:03:45.080> we<00:03:45.320> will<00:03:45.440> actually

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:45.620 
go inside the gallo so we will actually

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:47.770 
go inside the gallo so we will actually
get<00:03:45.830> a<00:03:45.890> second<00:03:46.250> list<00:03:46.430> because<00:03:46.760> max's<00:03:47.540> says

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:47.780 
get a second list because max's says

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:49.660 
get a second list because max's says
that<00:03:48.110> we<00:03:48.500> don't<00:03:48.620> have<00:03:48.739> enough<00:03:49.010> energy<00:03:49.160> we

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:49.670 
that we don't have enough energy we

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:51.070 
that we don't have enough energy we
might<00:03:49.880> need<00:03:50.030> a<00:03:50.090> second<00:03:50.480> where<00:03:50.630> school<00:03:50.930> he

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:51.080 
might need a second where school he

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:52.810 
might need a second where school he
doesn't<00:03:51.350> say<00:03:51.470> that<00:03:51.709> exactly<00:03:51.890> but<00:03:52.280> he<00:03:52.640> says

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:52.820 
doesn't say that exactly but he says

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:54.759 
doesn't say that exactly but he says
something<00:03:53.120> that's<00:03:53.269> similar<00:03:53.720> to<00:03:53.780> that<00:03:54.019> which

00:03:54.759 --> 00:03:54.769 
something that's similar to that which

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:57.970 
something that's similar to that which
