00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:09.090
 my friends welcome to 

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:10.559
 a new video of me because I know 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.270
 that some of you also own 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:13.860
 draw because he often in the comments 

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:15.330
 write as bright as you do that 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.590
 I do not want to get a bit better 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.610
 only you can not even couple 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.110
 raushauen tips 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:20.640
 and that's exactly what I'm doing today today 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:25.350
 it's the top five of my personal 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:27.330
 sign up my personal tip 

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:29.250
 Place number 5 is now up 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.349
 no case of false hope over 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.610
 expensive material and I have of you 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:34.050
 ever so desperate in the 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.730
 written comments tell me 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.040
 please which donor you use with it 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.540
 It is guaranteed to work out right away and it 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.159
 Become mega realistic from the moment I am 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.229
 I only have these pens and I can 

00:00:41.159 --> 00:00:45.239
 say that will not happen you can 

00:00:43.229 --> 00:00:47.400
 buy the most expensive donors in the world 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.780
 It is clear that it is easier to hand 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.970
 be different that somehow easier 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.650
 to hold that are geely that 

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:54.239
 cancel less or something but me 

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:55.500
 I made the experience personally 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:56.879
 I already have a lot of donors 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.409
 I have your donors 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.239
 I had had cheap donations and 

00:00:58.409 --> 00:01:02.040
 it does not make a big difference in the end 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.659
 difference for the picture it comes a lot 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:05.989
 much more on the technology as well 

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:05.989
 the material 

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:11.790
 my tip burst mafia no fear 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.110
 Before contrasts countries you briefly here 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.580
 next to me a video sequence where i am 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.690
 jens wawrczeck have drawn that 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.860
 of course you can find it on mine 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:19.710
 channel and none at all 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.780
 self-promotion times are due 

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.580
 really contrasts in the very beginning when 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.350
 You can see how I started this brown in the beginning 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.420
 sign of the time already not nice 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.950
 but rely on it to contrast well 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.270
 bring my good picture even if it am 

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.220
 At first maybe shit looks like 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.930
 just trust your instincts and have 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.170
 because there is no fear so a little too 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.170
 play 

00:01:36.619 --> 00:01:41.520
 my tip on number three is 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.960
 finds a suitable backdrop to the sign 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.189
 By that I mean that they are careful 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.780
 should something happen around you 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.890
 while now that is drawing, that is 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.509
 not that you are distracting yourself somehow 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.950
 should all just fix something 

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.210
 something happens what happens 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.470
 but I mean that you are 

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.750
 that should think carefully before 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:56.640
 what movie you watched it or or 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:58.380
 which movie you sound like 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.179
 somehow audio play becomes or an audiobook 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.429
 or music world something out of what you guys 

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:04.619
 Inspires what you like really well 

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:07.229
 I am personally for example santiago 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:11.039
 higher so the music I celebrate already 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:13.019
 Quite well is open which 

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:14.010
 this music hear pictures a thousand times 

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:15.840
 better than me for example 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.459
 somehow fuck shit at rtl or something 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.290
 that's why you skin in any case 

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:21.269
 Something about you in the background 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:23.130
 totally inspiring what motivates you so that 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:24.630
 It makes more fun than you will sign 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:26.849
 it your pictures and in the end everyone 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:31.739
 Note if it was fun 

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:33.989
 or not and my tip on space 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:35.970
 number roters where works at no 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:36.959
 case large area , I take that too 

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.099
 a thing I totally on the 

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:40.530
 have read comments that he 

00:02:38.099 --> 00:02:42.720
 draws and excites you that 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.760
 you always have these single signs 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.049
 dashes and the paper structure totally 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.609
 See and is simply not 

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:49.680
 looks realistic so it's easy 

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:52.350
 not spacious enough if you are too 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:54.690
 Works large because you somehow 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:56.670
 wants to finish quickly then sees 

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:58.049
 that's how it looks and then it's clear that it 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.459
 not exactly realistic in the end 

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:01.200
 That's why it really looks 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:04.410
 The time of the set is the same now 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:06.870
 makes and very small area 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:10.730
 works only millimeter for 

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:12.180
 millimeters and very slowly and precisely 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:13.620
 works then it is already 

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.359
 different so take yourselves 

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:17.100
 really the time is not working that way 

00:03:15.359 --> 00:03:20.450
 large area but always only in the whole 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.450
 small detail it will be worthwhile 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:25.739
 and my tip is number one 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:26.970
 do not give up and always stay tuned 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:28.500
 will give you pictures totally 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:29.940
 frustrating because you think so 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:31.849
 looks like a bunch of shit i 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:34.590
 I can not do that anymore 

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:36.510
 that is quite normal, no one comes to 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.190
 world and paints mona lisa and in some 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.780
 the learning process just takes something 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:41.129
 longer with some goes a little faster 

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.480
 personally, he has a very long time 

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:44.879
 lasted so I draw my already 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.319
 whole life I am 22 so milk 

00:03:44.879 --> 00:03:49.650
 That's why if you are now 12 years 

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:51.420
 first draws then makes power 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:54.450
 your head did not work 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:56.190
 it is quite normal for him to learn so 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:58.049
 do not give up but just always 

00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:59.579
 keep going you will 

00:03:58.049 --> 00:04:01.410
 It is better because it is purely a matter of practice 

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:03.390
 Of course, there is also a certain amount 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:06.840
 talent and interest but if you 

00:04:03.390 --> 00:04:09.180
 that brings and practices a lot then that becomes 

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:10.349
 have you getting that water still 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.549
 again with my video here 

00:04:10.349 --> 00:04:12.660
 you can now have two under it 

00:04:11.549 --> 00:04:13.859
 click more videos 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:15.930
 Here you come to another 

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:18.359
 drawing here to a random video 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:19.680
 so let yourself be surprised magic and 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:22.459
 I would say makes makes good's 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.459
 better and ciao
