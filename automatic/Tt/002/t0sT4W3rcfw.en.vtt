00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
a small light but we have a dimmer here

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.710 
a small light but we have a dimmer here
okay<00:02:52.530> so<00:02:53.489> we<00:02:53.670> start<00:02:53.940> to<00:02:54.030> play<00:02:54.239> with<00:02:54.420> the<00:02:54.510> dimmer

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
okay so we start to play with the dimmer

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.680 
okay so we start to play with the dimmer
and<00:02:54.989> also<00:02:55.440> we<00:02:56.160> have<00:02:56.310> a<00:02:56.340> back<00:02:56.640> light<00:02:56.849> LED<00:02:57.330> here

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:57.690 
and also we have a back light LED here

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.810 
and also we have a back light LED here
that<00:02:58.290> allows<00:02:58.440> you<00:02:58.799> as<00:02:58.980> you<00:02:59.099> see<00:02:59.310> here<00:02:59.549> on<00:02:59.670> this

00:02:59.810 --> 00:02:59.820 
that allows you as you see here on this

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.840 
that allows you as you see here on this
light<00:03:00.170> to<00:03:01.170> illuminate<00:03:01.440> the<00:03:01.859> camera<00:03:02.280> commands

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850

light LED as in the other lights that

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.479 
light LED as in the other lights that
we've<00:03:14.880> seen<00:03:15.380> what's<00:03:16.380> more<00:03:16.650> we<00:03:16.920> have<00:03:17.100> also<00:03:17.280> the

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
we've seen what's more we have also the

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:19.520 
we've seen what's more we have also the
flash<00:03:17.760> function<00:03:18.060> in<00:03:18.420> this<00:03:18.540> the<00:03:18.780> output<00:03:19.260> of<00:03:19.290> the

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
flash function in this the output of the

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.440 
flash function in this the output of the

output<00:03:24.060> in<00:03:24.569> continuous<00:03:25.230> mode<00:03:25.489> so<00:03:26.489> here<00:03:26.730> we

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:26.850 
output in continuous mode so here we

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:30.410 
output in continuous mode so here we
have<00:03:26.880> an<00:03:27.180> 84<00:03:27.810> LED<00:03:28.370> concept<00:03:29.370> is<00:03:29.519> similar<00:03:29.940> to<00:03:30.269> the
