using these body measurements it's going
to<00:00:26.740> kind<00:00:26.920> of<00:00:27.039> strip<00:00:27.340> the<00:00:27.520> emotion<00:00:27.910> out<00:00:28.030> of<00:00:28.090> it

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:28.300 
to kind of strip the emotion out of it

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:29.939 
to kind of strip the emotion out of it
and<00:00:28.690> keep<00:00:28.840> it<00:00:28.990> specific<00:00:29.530> either<00:00:29.680> you're

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:29.949 
and keep it specific either you're

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:32.279 
and keep it specific either you're
getting<00:00:30.100> leaner<00:00:30.730> and<00:00:30.880> stronger<00:00:31.210> as<00:00:31.480> evidenced

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:34.120 
by increased body measurements or you're

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.090 
by increased body measurements or you're
not<00:00:34.269> so<00:00:34.600> there<00:00:35.170> won't<00:00:35.350> be<00:00:35.499> any<00:00:35.589> middle<00:00:36.069> ground

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:36.100 
not so there won't be any middle ground

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.160 
not so there won't be any middle ground
there<00:00:36.550> what<00:00:37.329> I<00:00:37.359> want<00:00:37.569> you<00:00:37.659> to<00:00:37.690> think<00:00:37.839> about<00:00:37.960> is

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:38.170 
there what I want you to think about is

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:39.779 
there what I want you to think about is
when<00:00:38.289> you<00:00:38.379> look<00:00:38.530> at<00:00:38.649> that<00:00:38.769> spreadsheet<00:00:39.159> you'll

00:00:39.779 --> 00:00:39.789 
when you look at that spreadsheet you'll

00:00:39.789 --> 00:00:41.369 
when you look at that spreadsheet you'll
notice<00:00:40.120> that<00:00:40.210> everything<00:00:40.449> is<00:00:40.600> evaluated<00:00:41.260> on

00:00:41.369 --> 00:00:41.379 
notice that everything is evaluated on

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:42.750 
notice that everything is evaluated on
the<00:00:41.499> left<00:00:41.739> and<00:00:41.920> the<00:00:41.979> right<00:00:42.190> side<00:00:42.489> and<00:00:42.699> that's

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:42.760 
the left and the right side and that's

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.639 
the left and the right side and that's
just<00:00:43.059> for<00:00:43.210> symmetry<00:00:43.539> it's<00:00:44.199> to<00:00:44.379> make<00:00:44.530> you<00:00:44.620> a

00:00:44.639 --> 00:00:44.649 
just for symmetry it's to make you a

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:47.340 
just for symmetry it's to make you a
more<00:00:45.159> well-rounded<00:00:45.489> and<00:00:46.149> a<00:00:46.569> more<00:00:46.839> efficient

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.070 
the tops of the hips where you would be

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:13.290 
the tops of the hips where you would be
able<00:02:12.160> to<00:02:12.250> put<00:02:12.460> your<00:02:12.610> hands

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:16.270 
would be below that and a little bit

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:17.780 
would be below that and a little bit
laterally<00:02:16.750> okay

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790 
laterally okay

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.980 
laterally okay
the<00:02:18.790> last<00:02:19.000> two<00:02:19.210> variables<00:02:19.570> I<00:02:19.660> want<00:02:19.840> you<00:02:19.900> to

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:19.990 
the last two variables I want you to

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:22.650 
the last two variables I want you to
think<00:02:20.140> about<00:02:20.260> on<00:02:21.160> the<00:02:21.340> quadriceps<00:02:22.000> what<00:02:22.570> we

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
think about on the quadriceps what we

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.020 
think about on the quadriceps what we
usually<00:02:22.810> do<00:02:23.080> is<00:02:23.260> we<00:02:23.290> do<00:02:23.470> a<00:02:23.700> pinky<00:02:24.700> finger<00:02:25.000> to

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:25.030 
usually do is we do a pinky finger to

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:26.460 
usually do is we do a pinky finger to
thumb<00:02:25.180> which<00:02:25.630> pretty<00:02:25.840> much<00:02:26.020> puts<00:02:26.260> you<00:02:26.320> in<00:02:26.410> the

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:26.470 
thumb which pretty much puts you in the

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.170 
thumb which pretty much puts you in the
middle<00:02:26.650> of<00:02:26.770> the<00:02:26.830> quad<00:02:27.010> I<00:02:27.430> want<00:02:27.910> you<00:02:28.000> to<00:02:28.090> be

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:28.180 
middle of the quad I want you to be

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.390 
middle of the quad I want you to be
thinking<00:02:28.390> about<00:02:28.630> that<00:02:28.990> measurement<00:02:29.440> and<00:02:29.740> then

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:30.400 
thinking about that measurement and then

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.790 
thinking about that measurement and then
make<00:02:30.610> sure<00:02:30.640> that<00:02:30.940> again<00:02:31.090> that<00:02:31.330> the<00:02:31.810> the<00:02:32.560> tape

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:32.800 
make sure that again that the the tape

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.530 
make sure that again that the the tape
measure<00:02:32.950> is<00:02:33.280> straight<00:02:33.610> across<00:02:33.730> the<00:02:34.120> leg<00:02:34.330> not

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:34.540 
measure is straight across the leg not

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:36.420 
measure is straight across the leg not
at<00:02:34.750> an<00:02:34.840> angle<00:02:35.170> then<00:02:35.680> when<00:02:35.860> you<00:02:35.950> come<00:02:36.160> down<00:02:36.190> to

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
at an angle then when you come down to

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.070 
at an angle then when you come down to
the<00:02:36.520> calf<00:02:36.760> I<00:02:36.970> want<00:02:37.180> you<00:02:37.270> to<00:02:37.360> try<00:02:37.540> to<00:02:37.600> find<00:02:37.900> the

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:38.080 
the calf I want you to try to find the

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.960 
the calf I want you to try to find the
thickest<00:02:38.500> part<00:02:38.710> of<00:02:38.800> the<00:02:38.860> calf<00:02:39.130> usually<00:02:39.850> it's

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
thickest part of the calf usually it's

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:41.610 
thickest part of the calf usually it's
about<00:02:40.060> three<00:02:40.480> inches<00:02:40.780> below<00:02:40.960> the<00:02:41.110> back<00:02:41.380> of<00:02:41.410> the

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:41.620 
about three inches below the back of the

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:42.210 
about three inches below the back of the
kneecap

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:42.220 
kneecap

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.450 
kneecap
again<00:02:42.700> make<00:02:42.940> sure<00:02:42.970> that<00:02:43.270> the<00:02:43.420> measurement<00:02:43.780> is

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:44.460 
again make sure that the measurement is

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:47.610 
again make sure that the measurement is
horizontal<00:02:45.460> to<00:02:45.610> the<00:02:45.640> ground<00:02:46.320> going<00:02:47.320> back<00:02:47.470> to

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
horizontal to the ground going back to

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:48.330 
horizontal to the ground going back to
the<00:02:47.740> upper<00:02:47.980> body

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
the upper body

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.430 
the upper body
you'll<00:02:48.700> notice<00:02:48.970> that<00:02:49.090> we<00:02:49.270> do<00:02:49.420> this<00:02:49.690> the<00:02:49.960> bicep

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
you'll notice that we do this the bicep

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.680 
you'll notice that we do this the bicep
the<00:02:50.650> forearm<00:02:51.130> and<00:02:51.250> the<00:02:51.340> wrist<00:02:51.510> believe<00:02:52.510> it<00:02:52.600> not

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
the forearm and the wrist believe it not

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.450 
the forearm and the wrist believe it not
the<00:02:52.840> risk<00:02:53.020> is<00:02:53.200> a<00:02:53.230> very<00:02:53.710> important<00:02:54.100> variable

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:54.460 
the risk is a very important variable
