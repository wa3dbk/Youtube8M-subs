00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.620
 hello to the new ones that I bring you a new 

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:12.330
 makeup tutorial and as I told you 

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.340
 in previous videos I will try 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.240
 do some by the end of the year and this is 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.220
 my proposal 

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:20.099
 as I already said also the other video of the 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.960
 high goal of goals there are new videos in 

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:25.800
 the channel is worth the best 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:28.289
 little weirder but good was like doing 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:32.340
 different from what you usually do is worth the 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:34.500
 trick or grace of this look is that the 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.050
 glitter is the whole external part is 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.900
 as if the outline will fade into 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.729
 Glitter is worth if you want more or 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:43.739
 less than hereu the idea of ​​how 

00:00:41.729 --> 00:00:47.240
 It's a good thing that if you liked it 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:49.810
 I hope I wanted to see you step by step 

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.810
 here 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:13.020
 we apply a prebase for shadows and 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:14.850
 also a shadow in cream a little 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.610
 bright so that it lasts longer 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:18.670
 the eye makeup 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.670
 and 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.690
 with a shadow of a dull gold 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.080
 let's create a base for all the 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.080
 eyelid mobile 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.130
 i 

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.689
 with a gold in the same hue but 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:42.280
 something brighter I will illuminate the 

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:42.280
 internal part of the half 

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:52.079
 and with a slightly golden brown I'll 

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.079
 Make up the external part of the eye 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:01.870
 we help ourselves with a medium brown clarito 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:04.470
 to blur these colors 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:04.470
 two 

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.480
 and with a dark color that does not become 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.830
 black I'm going to create a basin in the part 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.830
 external to give depth 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.180
 i 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:26.510
 and now with a black shadow I'm going to 

00:02:23.719 --> 00:02:29.859
 darken the outer part as if it were 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:29.859
 a blurred outline 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:39.000
 and of course we blew it a little 

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:39.000
 to integrate everything better 

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:47.660
 we outlined the upper lashes 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.660
 widening the external part 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:56.980
 two 

00:02:54.550 --> 00:03:00.390
 we apply black shadow we integrate it 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.390
 with what we had done previously 

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:10.760
 we help ourselves with a glitter fixer and 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:13.099
 I was missing a criterion and what 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:16.370
 we apply for the whole external part as 

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:18.680
 you are seeing and the delineated and then 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:21.980
 we passed the glitter or pigment that 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:24.560
 let's have the outlined above, not what 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:27.500
 let's wear in the glitter deep inside 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:30.420
 but that is as degraded and then the 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:32.530
 we also climb the basin 

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:35.170
 i 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:37.569
 and then with a brush that's clean, let's go 

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:41.100
 to go replicating a little touch to 

00:03:37.569 --> 00:03:41.100
 little to be degraded 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.950
 we delineate the lower lashes by 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:50.970
 the outer part with the eyeliner in 

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:53.430
 black gel and apply the fixative 

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:55.260
 glitter and finally we apply again 

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:58.010
 the glitter and then we will clean all 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.010
 the areas below 

00:03:58.550 --> 00:04:03.320
 we delineate the lower water line by the 

00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:05.510
 external part and we also delineate the 

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:08.180
 full superior 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:11.620
 all that remains is to apply mascara and 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:11.620
 false eyelashes if you wish 

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:21.350
 and it would be ready and it only remains to tell you 

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:23.420
 I'm going to put the rest of my face 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:25.640
 as we always prepare our skin 

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:28.180
 hydrating it and also using a 

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:31.370
 prebase of face either mattifying 

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:33.410
 neutralize what you need each 

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:36.730
 an I use a green for 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:36.730
 neutralize the roots 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:46.760
 we apply the makeup base and 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:48.590
 we will consider two things one that 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:50.750
 be long-lasting so that it lasts for us 

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:52.760
 more time and another that does not have a factor 

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:55.070
 of sunscreen since this reflects 

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:57.340
 the flash light when we make ourselves 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:05:01.160
 photos and bleaching us face 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:03.290
 we apply corrector, we blur it with 

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:05.650
 a synthetic brush and then we sealed it 

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:05.650
 all 

00:05:13.569 --> 00:05:15.689
 do not 

00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:28.000
 we define the face since being a 

00:05:26.170 --> 00:05:31.950
 makeup night as we also 

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.950
 help a little bit that looks more defined 

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:38.130
 we apply the blusher and what we can 

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:40.500
 to do is combine it more with the tone of the 

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:43.520
 lipstick that we use since the look of 

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:43.520
 pretty neutral eyes 

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:51.590
 and finally the lips I will give three 

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:51.590
 options look with hot pink 

00:05:52.449 --> 00:05:56.849
 a red that would be the most classic 

00:05:58.210 --> 00:06:03.680
 and finally the newt lips already that 

00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:05.690
 choice of each 

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:07.610
 and nothing here all that I hope that 

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:09.650
 I hope you have served it if it is 

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:11.570
 so you can give you little finger up 

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:14.030
 you can subscribe here below if you have not yet 

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:16.910
 what have you done that if you do this 

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:19.940
 look or one of those that you see 

00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:21.410
 inspired by my bible and others because if 

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:22.880
 you want to send them to me through networks 

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:25.070
 social that makes me a lot of 

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:27.350
 I have a great illusion at night 

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:29.810
 end of the year if I do not upload a video that 

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:31.190
 surely one will rise and nothing will 

00:06:29.810 --> 00:06:35.289
 we see the next videos I feel 

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:35.289
 huge take care of them a lot and see you later
