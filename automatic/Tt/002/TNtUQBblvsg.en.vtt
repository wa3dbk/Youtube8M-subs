00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
single person out there but i think that

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.639 
single person out there but i think that
they<00:00:56.789> can<00:00:57.149> it's<00:00:57.600> finally<00:00:58.170> time<00:00:58.230> for<00:00:58.379> them<00:00:58.590> to

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
they can it's finally time for them to

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.139 
they can it's finally time for them to
go<00:00:58.710> to<00:00:58.800> start<00:00:59.129> making<00:00:59.430> some<00:00:59.579> changes<00:00:59.820> and

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
go to start making some changes and

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.060 
go to start making some changes and
making<00:01:00.750> more<00:01:00.899> complicated<00:01:01.469> changes<00:01:01.890> and<00:01:02.039> I

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:02.070 
making more complicated changes and I

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:03.380 
making more complicated changes and I
mean<00:01:02.250> complicated<00:01:02.760> not<00:01:02.879> just<00:01:03.090> stuff<00:01:03.239> that's

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
mean complicated not just stuff that's

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.509 
mean complicated not just stuff that's
going<00:01:03.539> to<00:01:03.600> be<00:01:03.719> harder<00:01:04.049> to<00:01:04.080> use<00:01:04.409> but<00:01:05.129> stuff<00:01:05.339> that

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
going to be harder to use but stuff that

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.310 
going to be harder to use but stuff that
not<00:01:05.820> just<00:01:06.180> because<00:01:06.330> every<00:01:06.689> user<00:01:06.869> is<00:01:07.020> not<00:01:07.140> going

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
not just because every user is not going

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:09.859 
not just because every user is not going
to<00:01:07.380> use<00:01:07.619> it<00:01:07.650> or<00:01:08.060> understand<00:01:09.060> it<00:01:09.180> I<00:01:09.360> don't<00:01:09.720> think

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
to use it or understand it I don't think

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.179 
to use it or understand it I don't think
they<00:01:09.930> should<00:01:09.960> not<00:01:10.290> put<00:01:10.500> that<00:01:10.530> feature<00:01:10.830> in<00:01:11.070> I

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
they should not put that feature in I

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:12.469 
they should not put that feature in I
think<00:01:11.250> they<00:01:11.400> should<00:01:11.549> add<00:01:11.760> features<00:01:12.210> in<00:01:12.360> there

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
think they should add features in there

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:13.789 
think they should add features in there
even<00:01:12.750> though<00:01:12.840> it<00:01:12.900> may<00:01:13.020> just<00:01:13.049> be<00:01:13.260> for<00:01:13.530> the<00:01:13.590> tech

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
even though it may just be for the tech

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:15.499 
even though it may just be for the tech
savvy<00:01:14.070> people<00:01:14.310> out<00:01:14.520> there<00:01:14.760> but<00:01:15.180> at<00:01:15.270> least<00:01:15.360> you

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
savvy people out there but at least you

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:16.880 
savvy people out there but at least you
just<00:01:15.720> have<00:01:15.900> some<00:01:16.110> stuff<00:01:16.200> in<00:01:16.409> there<00:01:16.560> for<00:01:16.740> those

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
just have some stuff in there for those

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.410 
just have some stuff in there for those
that<00:01:17.369> set<00:01:17.670> me<00:01:17.700> good<00:01:18.000> people<00:01:18.299> out<00:01:18.360> there

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
that set me good people out there

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.050 
that set me good people out there
because<00:01:18.750> I<00:01:18.990> think<00:01:19.200> now<00:01:19.350> if<00:01:20.040> you<00:01:20.189> look<00:01:20.280> at<00:01:20.400> 2013

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
because I think now if you look at 2013

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.940 
because I think now if you look at 2013
compared<00:01:21.330> to<00:01:21.390> 2007<00:01:22.110> where<00:01:22.290> smartphones<00:01:22.799> are

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
compared to 2007 where smartphones are

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.520 
compared to 2007 where smartphones are
really<00:01:23.130> just<00:01:23.400> starting<00:01:23.549> to<00:01:23.729> come<00:01:23.970> out<00:01:24.000> I<00:01:24.930> think

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
really just starting to come out I think

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:26.690

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
that now the average users out there

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:28.249 
that now the average users out there
who's<00:01:26.939> using<00:01:27.119> a<00:01:27.240> smartphone<00:01:27.540> is<00:01:27.840> comfortable

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
who's using a smartphone is comfortable

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.050 
who's using a smartphone is comfortable
with<00:01:28.380> the<00:01:28.530> phone<00:01:28.710> now<00:01:28.890> they<00:01:29.070> they<00:01:29.520> they<00:01:29.729> may

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
with the phone now they they they may

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.940 
with the phone now they they they may
want<00:01:30.479> more<00:01:30.689> features<00:01:31.079> they<00:01:31.200> can<00:01:31.500> understand

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
want more features they can understand

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:34.340 
want more features they can understand
it<00:01:32.070> features<00:01:32.310> better<00:01:32.490> than<00:01:32.729> in<00:01:32.970> 2007<00:01:33.960> again

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
it features better than in 2007 again

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.160 
it features better than in 2007 again
the<00:01:34.829> majority<00:01:35.189> of<00:01:35.340> people<00:01:35.850> so<00:01:36.600> I<00:01:36.659> think<00:01:36.720> Apple

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
the majority of people so I think Apple

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.020 
the majority of people so I think Apple
especially<00:01:37.380> with<00:01:37.680> iOS<00:01:37.979> 6<00:01:38.250> they<00:01:38.640> made<00:01:38.820> a<00:01:38.850> little

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
especially with iOS 6 they made a little

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.149 
especially with iOS 6 they made a little
changes<00:01:39.479> do<00:01:39.570> not<00:01:39.600> disturb<00:01:40.020> VIP<00:01:40.710> male<00:01:40.920> all

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
changes do not disturb VIP male all

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.219 
changes do not disturb VIP male all
those<00:01:41.310> things<00:01:41.369> are<00:01:41.759> great<00:01:42.090> but<00:01:42.840> I<00:01:42.930> think<00:01:43.140> when

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
those things are great but I think when

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:44.780 
those things are great but I think when
it<00:01:43.320> gets<00:01:43.439> to<00:01:43.530> the<00:01:43.619> core<00:01:43.649> things<00:01:44.340> that<00:01:44.549> you<00:01:44.640> use

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:44.790 
it gets to the core things that you use

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:47.420 
it gets to the core things that you use
on<00:01:44.820> a<00:01:45.030> daily<00:01:45.390> basis<00:01:46.229> I<00:01:46.409> mean<00:01:46.799> just<00:01:46.829> changing<00:01:47.340> my

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
on a daily basis I mean just changing my

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:49.429 
on a daily basis I mean just changing my
brightness<00:01:47.700> again<00:01:48.119> I<00:01:48.149> argue<00:01:48.780> this<00:01:48.899> a<00:01:48.960> lot<00:01:49.200> I

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
brightness again I argue this a lot I

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.050 
brightness again I argue this a lot I
hate<00:01:49.860> having<00:01:49.979> to<00:01:50.159> go<00:01:50.340> into<00:01:50.460> settings<00:01:50.790> every

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:51.060 
hate having to go into settings every

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.340 
hate having to go into settings every
single<00:01:51.240> time<00:01:51.360> just<00:01:51.659> adjust<00:01:51.990> my<00:01:52.079> brightness

me<00:02:04.040> but<00:02:05.040> I<00:02:05.070> look<00:02:05.579> at<00:02:05.729> Android<00:02:06.270> which<00:02:06.509> i<00:02:06.719> think

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
me but I look at Android which i think

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.359 
me but I look at Android which i think
you<00:02:07.110> know<00:02:07.200> over<00:02:07.619> these<00:02:07.770> past<00:02:08.039> few<00:02:08.190> years

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
you know over these past few years

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:09.529 
you know over these past few years
especially<00:02:08.459> for<00:02:08.819> the<00:02:08.879> past<00:02:09.060> year<00:02:09.239> and<00:02:09.300> a<00:02:09.390> half

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
especially for the past year and a half

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:10.910 
especially for the past year and a half
or<00:02:09.750> so<00:02:09.780> I<00:02:10.110> really

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:10.920 
or so I really

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:13.820 
or so I really
a<00:02:10.979> huge<00:02:11.730> huge<00:02:12.000> fan<00:02:12.300> of<00:02:12.330> it<00:02:12.540> I<00:02:12.690> like<00:02:13.260> most<00:02:13.709> things

time again we get a lot of cool features

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.240 
time again we get a lot of cool features
at<00:02:39.239> least<00:02:39.390> twice<00:02:39.720> a<00:02:39.989> year<00:02:40.260> from<00:02:40.440> google<00:02:40.830> where

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
at least twice a year from google where

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:44.030 
at least twice a year from google where
apple<00:02:41.730> still<00:02:41.940> net<00:02:42.180> once<00:02:42.540> a<00:02:42.690> year<00:02:42.959> update<00:02:43.769> time

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
apple still net once a year update time

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.040 
apple still net once a year update time
cycle<00:02:44.550> which<00:02:45.120> again<00:02:45.510> I<00:02:45.600> don't<00:02:45.660> think<00:02:45.930> that's

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:46.050 
cycle which again I don't think that's

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:48.199 
cycle which again I don't think that's
totally<00:02:46.560> bad<00:02:46.830> but<00:02:47.340> I<00:02:47.519> think<00:02:47.910> if<00:02:48.030> you're<00:02:48.180> going

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
totally bad but I think if you're going

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:49.850 
totally bad but I think if you're going
to<00:02:48.510> be<00:02:48.600> waiting<00:02:48.810> you<00:02:49.260> know<00:02:49.380> and<00:02:49.500> it's<00:02:49.620> higher

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
to be waiting you know and it's higher

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.630 
to be waiting you know and it's higher

the playground like I'm stepping back

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.370 
the playground like I'm stepping back
like<00:03:02.519> I<00:03:02.549> meant<00:03:02.760> whoa<00:03:02.850> I<00:03:02.880> have<00:03:03.090> to<00:03:03.690> get<00:03:03.930> this<00:03:04.110> and

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
like I meant whoa I have to get this and

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.110 
like I meant whoa I have to get this and
with<00:03:04.769> iOS<00:03:05.100> 6<00:03:05.340> I<00:03:05.459> really<00:03:05.700> didn't<00:03:05.910> get<00:03:05.970> that

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:06.120 
with iOS 6 I really didn't get that

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.759 
with iOS 6 I really didn't get that
feeling<00:03:06.299> now<00:03:06.810> they<00:03:06.959> drop<00:03:07.170> the<00:03:07.290> ball<00:03:07.440> with<00:03:07.650> the

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
feeling now they drop the ball with the

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:09.530 
feeling now they drop the ball with the
maps<00:03:08.010> of<00:03:08.250> course<00:03:08.430> we<00:03:08.549> know<00:03:08.670> that<00:03:08.880> and<00:03:09.090> they

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
maps of course we know that and they

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:10.910 
maps of course we know that and they
spend<00:03:09.780> a<00:03:09.840> lot<00:03:09.989> of<00:03:10.019> time<00:03:10.170> and<00:03:10.410> resources<00:03:10.470> on

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
spend a lot of time and resources on

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.229 
spend a lot of time and resources on
that<00:03:11.040> one<00:03:11.190> day<00:03:11.250> I<00:03:11.280> think<00:03:11.459> they<00:03:11.760> really<00:03:12.030> didn't

00:03:12.229 --> 00:03:12.239 
that one day I think they really didn't

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:14.000 
that one day I think they really didn't
need<00:03:12.360> to<00:03:12.420> just<00:03:12.810> keep<00:03:13.080> using<00:03:13.260> google<00:03:13.590> maps<00:03:13.620> and

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
need to just keep using google maps and

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:15.949 
need to just keep using google maps and
I<00:03:14.400> think<00:03:14.610> that<00:03:14.760> really<00:03:14.790> set<00:03:15.329> off<00:03:15.359> some<00:03:15.540> changes

00:03:15.949 --> 00:03:15.959 
I think that really set off some changes

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:18.530 
I think that really set off some changes

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.150 
I've said this before i'm really excited
to<00:03:39.930> see<00:03:40.049> what<00:03:40.170> Johnny<00:03:40.380> I've<00:03:40.560> can<00:03:40.799> do<00:03:40.920> he's<00:03:41.130> a

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:41.160 
to see what Johnny I've can do he's a

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:43.550 
to see what Johnny I've can do he's a
genius<00:03:41.730> with<00:03:42.299> design<00:03:42.690> so<00:03:43.049> if<00:03:43.140> you<00:03:43.230> can<00:03:43.380> really

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
genius with design so if you can really

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:44.960 
genius with design so if you can really
just<00:03:43.709> just<00:03:44.070> bring<00:03:44.340> that<00:03:44.519> over<00:03:44.640> to<00:03:44.820> our<00:03:44.850> website

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:44.970 
just just bring that over to our website

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:47.060 
just just bring that over to our website
I<00:03:45.299> think<00:03:45.420> that<00:03:45.660> would<00:03:45.750> be<00:03:45.810> cool<00:03:45.989> Plus<00:03:46.560> him<00:03:46.920> and

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:47.070 
I think that would be cool Plus him and

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:48.560 
I think that would be cool Plus him and
Scott<00:03:47.280> Forstall<00:03:47.549> didn't<00:03:48.030> get<00:03:48.120> along<00:03:48.299> at<00:03:48.359> all

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:48.570 
Scott Forstall didn't get along at all

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:51.110 
Scott Forstall didn't get along at all
so<00:03:49.109> if<00:03:49.410> they<00:03:49.739> kind<00:03:49.980> of<00:03:50.040> hated<00:03:50.340> each<00:03:50.430> other<00:03:50.640> so<00:03:50.730> I

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:51.120 
so if they kind of hated each other so I

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.880 
so if they kind of hated each other so I
think<00:03:51.390> that<00:03:51.600> part<00:03:52.109> of<00:03:52.140> the<00:03:52.230> extra<00:03:52.530> motivation

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:52.890 
think that part of the extra motivation

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:54.710 
think that part of the extra motivation
for<00:03:53.100> him<00:03:53.250> to<00:03:53.400> really<00:03:53.579> just<00:03:54.150> make<00:03:54.299> iOS

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
for him to really just make iOS

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:56.090 
for him to really just make iOS
something<00:03:55.079> totally<00:03:55.440> different<00:03:55.620> something

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:56.100

the<00:04:03.359> OS<00:04:03.630> great<00:04:04.109> OS<00:04:04.380> is<00:04:04.560> what<00:04:04.709> i<00:04:04.769> use<00:04:04.829> daily<00:04:05.370> but

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
the OS great OS is what i use daily but

the OS great OS is what i use daily but
i<00:04:06.030> think<00:04:06.239> that<00:04:06.359> it<00:04:06.420> has<00:04:06.510> a<00:04:06.540> lot<00:04:06.720> of<00:04:06.750> potential

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:07.139 
i think that it has a lot of potential

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:09.259 
i think that it has a lot of potential
even<00:04:07.829> those<00:04:07.950> who<00:04:08.100> has<00:04:08.280> the<00:04:08.459> best<00:04:08.670> application

even those who has the best application

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:10.879 
even those who has the best application
easily<00:04:09.750> has<00:04:09.900> the<00:04:10.049> best<00:04:10.200> application<00:04:10.739> on<00:04:10.829> the
