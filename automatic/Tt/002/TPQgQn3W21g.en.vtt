oK<00:00:08.170> we've<00:00:08.350> tried<00:00:08.740> to<00:00:08.770> set<00:00:09.160> this<00:00:09.370> burner<00:00:09.730> up<00:00:10.059> for

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:10.360 
oK we've tried to set this burner up for

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:13.000 
oK we've tried to set this burner up for
running<00:00:10.660> a<00:00:10.750> half-inch<00:00:11.379> naw

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:13.010 
running a half-inch naw

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:18.880 
running a half-inch naw
to<00:00:13.190> run<00:00:13.400> into<00:00:13.850> a<00:00:14.530> limit<00:00:15.790> on<00:00:17.260> how<00:00:18.260> efficient<00:00:18.830> we

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:18.890 
to run into a limit on how efficient we

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:21.190 
to run into a limit on how efficient we
could<00:00:19.190> get<00:00:19.490> the<00:00:19.940> bird

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:21.200 
could get the bird

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:26.620 
could get the bird
well<00:00:23.110> so<00:00:24.110> why<00:00:24.470> couldn't<00:00:25.100> I<00:00:25.280> get<00:00:25.630> higher

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:26.630 
well so why couldn't I get higher

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:32.290 
well so why couldn't I get higher
efficiency<00:00:29.710> list<00:00:30.710> we're<00:00:31.490> looking<00:00:31.880> at<00:00:32.119> the

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:32.300 
efficiency list we're looking at the

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.270 
efficiency list we're looking at the
head<00:00:32.540> of<00:00:32.780> the<00:00:32.960> burner<00:00:33.200> you<00:00:33.800> know<00:00:33.920> this<00:00:34.130> is<00:00:34.250> a

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:34.280 
head of the burner you know this is a

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.950 
head of the burner you know this is a
Becky<00:00:35.680> flame<00:00:36.680> retention<00:00:37.250> head<00:00:37.550> and<00:00:37.960> let's

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:38.960 
Becky flame retention head and let's

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:44.380 
Becky flame retention head and let's
look<00:00:39.140> a<00:00:39.260> little<00:00:39.290> closer<00:00:39.770> at<00:00:40.129> this<00:00:40.550> yet<00:00:43.390> okay

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:44.390 
look a little closer at this yet okay

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.540 
look a little closer at this yet okay
what<00:00:44.629> I'm<00:00:44.720> looking<00:00:45.110> at<00:00:45.320> is<00:00:45.710> right<00:00:46.040> here<00:00:46.340> see

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:46.550 
what I'm looking at is right here see

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:51.280 
what I'm looking at is right here see
those<00:00:46.699> slots<00:00:49.360> we've<00:00:50.360> got<00:00:50.570> these<00:00:50.750> little<00:00:51.080> slots

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:51.290 
those slots we've got these little slots

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:53.410 
those slots we've got these little slots
here<00:00:51.739> that<00:00:51.980> are<00:00:52.129> actually<00:00:52.519> supposed<00:00:52.940> to<00:00:53.150> swirl

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:53.420 
here that are actually supposed to swirl

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.229 
here that are actually supposed to swirl
the<00:00:53.629> air<00:00:54.070> but<00:00:55.070> I've<00:00:55.190> got<00:00:55.370> these<00:00:55.580> slots<00:00:55.940> out

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:56.239 
the air but I've got these slots out

00:00:56.239 --> 00:01:01.000 
the air but I've got these slots out
here<00:00:56.479> -<00:00:57.370> this<00:00:58.370> is<00:00:58.760> an<00:00:58.909> f3<00:00:59.659> hit<00:01:00.049> and<00:01:00.739> it's<00:01:00.890> a

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:01.010 
here - this is an f3 hit and it's a

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:08.370 
here - this is an f3 hit and it's a
Beckett<00:01:01.370> number<00:01:03.040> this<00:01:04.040> is<00:01:04.250> for<00:01:05.320> nozzle<00:01:06.320> sizes

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:08.380 
Beckett number this is for nozzle sizes

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:14.200 
Beckett number this is for nozzle sizes
0.75<00:01:09.380> to<00:01:10.299> 1.25<00:01:11.299> gallons<00:01:12.200> per<00:01:12.380> hour<00:01:12.729> so<00:01:13.729> I<00:01:13.760> don't

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:14.210 
0.75 to 1.25 gallons per hour so I don't

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.350 
0.75 to 1.25 gallons per hour so I don't
have<00:01:14.390> the<00:01:14.479> right<00:01:14.690> head<00:01:15.049> on<00:01:15.229> this<00:01:15.380> burner

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:16.360 
have the right head on this burner

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:23.649 
have the right head on this burner
so<00:01:17.360> to<00:01:17.750> reduce<00:01:18.229> the<00:01:19.750> nozzle<00:01:20.750> size<00:01:22.090> down<00:01:23.090> to<00:01:23.270> 0.5

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:23.659 
so to reduce the nozzle size down to 0.5

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:26.139 
so to reduce the nozzle size down to 0.5
or<00:01:24.350> I'll<00:01:24.500> probably<00:01:24.770> even<00:01:25.010> try<00:01:25.219> point<00:01:25.490> 4<00:01:25.820> I

00:01:26.139 --> 00:01:26.149 
or I'll probably even try point 4 I

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:29.950 
or I'll probably even try point 4 I
can't<00:01:26.840> use<00:01:27.049> this<00:01:27.820> it's<00:01:28.820> too<00:01:29.149> big<00:01:29.390> it<00:01:29.539> puts<00:01:29.750> too

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
can't use this it's too big it puts too

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.840 
can't use this it's too big it puts too
much<00:01:29.990> air<00:01:30.380> in<00:01:30.530> there<00:01:30.740> it's<00:01:31.310> not<00:01:31.460> gonna<00:01:31.579> make<00:01:31.729> an

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:31.850 
much air in there it's not gonna make an

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:36.760 
much air in there it's not gonna make an
efficient<00:01:32.240> burn<00:01:33.579> so<00:01:34.579> I<00:01:34.990> will<00:01:35.990> show<00:01:36.259> you<00:01:36.320> what

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770 
efficient burn so I will show you what

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.940 
efficient burn so I will show you what
the<00:01:37.179> f0<00:01:38.179> head<00:01:38.600> looks<00:01:39.109> like<00:01:39.350> because<00:01:39.770> that's

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:39.950 
the f0 head looks like because that's

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.520 
the f0 head looks like because that's
what<00:01:40.100> we're<00:01:40.219> gonna<00:01:40.310> put<00:01:40.549> on<00:01:40.759> the<00:01:41.329> f0<00:01:41.929> head<00:01:42.259> is

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:42.530 
what we're gonna put on the f0 head is

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:51.969 
what we're gonna put on the f0 head is
designed<00:01:43.719> 4.4<00:01:44.719> to<00:01:45.579> 0.75<00:01:50.200> nozzles<00:01:51.200> this<00:01:51.770> is<00:01:51.950> a

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:51.979 
designed 4.4 to 0.75 nozzles this is a

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:56.249 
designed 4.4 to 0.75 nozzles this is a
by<00:01:52.399> the<00:01:52.460> way<00:01:52.700> this<00:01:52.909> is<00:01:53.119> on<00:01:53.299> the<00:01:54.310> AF<00:01:55.310> and<00:01:55.579> AFG

00:01:56.249 --> 00:01:56.259 
by the way this is on the AF and AFG

00:01:56.259 --> 00:02:00.599 
by the way this is on the AF and AFG
model<00:01:57.670> burner<00:01:58.780> and<00:01:59.780> that's<00:01:59.990> what<00:02:00.170> this<00:02:00.289> is

00:02:00.599 --> 00:02:00.609 
model burner and that's what this is

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:03.170 
model burner and that's what this is
okay

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
okay

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.410 
okay
okay<00:02:03.930> what<00:02:04.170> I'm<00:02:04.290> showing<00:02:04.590> here<00:02:04.830> is<00:02:05.760> a<00:02:05.820> couple

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
okay what I'm showing here is a couple

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.120 
okay what I'm showing here is a couple
of<00:02:06.570> FO<00:02:07.200> heads<00:02:07.890> and<00:02:08.990> I'll<00:02:09.990> get<00:02:10.200> closer<00:02:10.440> on<00:02:10.830> and

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
of FO heads and I'll get closer on and

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:12.650 
of FO heads and I'll get closer on and
I'll<00:02:11.220> tell<00:02:11.460> you<00:02:11.520> the<00:02:11.640> difference<00:02:11.820> between<00:02:12.450> the

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
I'll tell you the difference between the

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:16.190 
I'll tell you the difference between the
two<00:02:13.940> okay<00:02:14.940> the<00:02:15.120> difference<00:02:15.330> between<00:02:15.990> these

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
two okay the difference between these

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.960 
two okay the difference between these
two<00:02:16.620> I<00:02:17.300> put<00:02:18.300> my<00:02:18.420> f3<00:02:18.900> head<00:02:19.140> on<00:02:19.320> here<00:02:19.680> and<00:02:20.670> you<00:02:20.790> can

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
two I put my f3 head on here and you can

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:26.110 
two I put my f3 head on here and you can
see<00:02:21.180> the<00:02:21.330> slots<00:02:21.660> in<00:02:21.930> this<00:02:22.080> thing<00:02:22.320> very<00:02:22.500> easily

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:26.120 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:31.730 

now<00:02:27.120> this<00:02:27.300> one<00:02:27.860> doesn't<00:02:28.860> have<00:02:29.190> them<00:02:30.530> that's<00:02:31.530> a

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:31.740 
now this one doesn't have them that's a

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.400 
now this one doesn't have them that's a
difference<00:02:32.100> between<00:02:32.400> those<00:02:32.520> two<00:02:32.880> heads<00:02:33.150> now<00:02:34.080> I

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
difference between those two heads now I

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:36.830 
difference between those two heads now I
got<00:02:35.310> another<00:02:35.580> head<00:02:35.910> here<00:02:36.240> and<00:02:36.420> this<00:02:36.570> is<00:02:36.720> an

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:36.840 
got another head here and this is an

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.500 
got another head here and this is an
asshole<00:02:37.020> head<00:02:37.590> but<00:02:38.520> it's<00:02:38.670> got<00:02:38.880> a<00:02:38.910> ceramic

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510 
asshole head but it's got a ceramic

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:42.680 
asshole head but it's got a ceramic
insulator<00:02:40.020> around<00:02:40.110> it<00:02:40.940> some<00:02:41.940> of<00:02:41.970> the<00:02:42.180> flame

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
insulator around it some of the flame

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:47.090 
insulator around it some of the flame
retention<00:02:43.410> fires<00:02:44.190> are<00:02:44.520> very<00:02:44.730> hot<00:02:45.060> and<00:02:46.100> if

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:47.100 
retention fires are very hot and if

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.610 
retention fires are very hot and if
they're<00:02:47.310> hot<00:02:47.640> enough<00:02:48.170> they<00:02:49.170> will<00:02:49.410> actually

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
they're hot enough they will actually

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:56.150 
they're hot enough they will actually
warp<00:02:50.100> this<00:02:50.340> hit<00:02:51.620> so<00:02:52.620> that<00:02:53.270> insulator<00:02:54.270> is<00:02:55.160> just

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:56.160 
warp this hit so that insulator is just

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.320 
warp this hit so that insulator is just
to<00:02:56.310> keep<00:02:56.459> the<00:02:56.670> head<00:02:56.850> from<00:02:57.060> getting<00:02:57.390> warped<00:02:57.690> so

00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.330 
to keep the head from getting warped so

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:01.730 
to keep the head from getting warped so
we'll<00:03:00.330> probably<00:03:00.540> try<00:03:00.990> this<00:03:01.050> one<00:03:01.440> on<00:03:01.620> the

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:01.740 
we'll probably try this one on the

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:04.760 
we'll probably try this one on the
burner<00:03:02.240> and<00:03:03.240> I'll<00:03:04.080> show<00:03:04.260> you<00:03:04.320> a<00:03:04.410> little<00:03:04.530> looks

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:04.770 
burner and I'll show you a little looks

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:10.830 
burner and I'll show you a little looks
like<00:03:04.950> on<00:03:05.100> the<00:03:05.220> head

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:16.420 

okay<00:03:11.840> there<00:03:12.110> we<00:03:12.260> are<00:03:12.290> with<00:03:12.620> it<00:03:12.769> mounted<00:03:15.430> it's

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:16.430 
okay there we are with it mounted it's

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.670 
okay there we are with it mounted it's
not<00:03:16.640> quite<00:03:16.970> ready<00:03:17.209> to<00:03:17.390> go<00:03:17.780> there's<00:03:18.349> another

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
not quite ready to go there's another

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.530 
not quite ready to go there's another
part<00:03:19.099> that<00:03:19.189> comes<00:03:19.549> with<00:03:19.849> us<00:03:20.090> and<00:03:20.269> I'll<00:03:20.329> show

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:20.540 
part that comes with us and I'll show

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.100 
part that comes with us and I'll show
you<00:03:20.599> what<00:03:20.840> it<00:03:20.959> is<00:03:22.360> okay<00:03:23.360> I<00:03:23.390> pulled<00:03:23.689> the<00:03:23.810> gun<00:03:24.079> out

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:24.110 
you what it is okay I pulled the gun out

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:25.680 
you what it is okay I pulled the gun out
of<00:03:24.439> this<00:03:24.620> thing

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
of this thing

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:32.110 
of this thing
let's<00:03:26.690> see<00:03:26.930> it<00:03:27.049> there<00:03:27.349> now<00:03:30.549> this<00:03:31.549> is<00:03:31.700> a<00:03:31.730> part

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:32.120 
let's see it there now this is a part

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.059 
let's see it there now this is a part
I'm<00:03:32.239> going<00:03:32.390> to<00:03:32.450> put<00:03:32.690> in<00:03:32.930> now<00:03:33.650> there's<00:03:33.890> already

00:03:34.059 --> 00:03:34.069 
I'm going to put in now there's already

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:36.849 
I'm going to put in now there's already
one<00:03:34.489> on<00:03:34.819> it<00:03:35.030> right<00:03:35.269> here<00:03:35.659> if<00:03:36.200> you<00:03:36.379> look<00:03:36.590> close

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:36.859 
one on it right here if you look close

00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:38.979 
one on it right here if you look close
you<00:03:36.890> can<00:03:37.069> see<00:03:37.269> there's<00:03:38.269> one<00:03:38.359> of<00:03:38.599> those<00:03:38.690> plates

00:03:38.979 --> 00:03:38.989 
you can see there's one of those plates

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:41.949 
you can see there's one of those plates
there<00:03:39.409> but<00:03:40.159> this<00:03:40.400> is<00:03:40.609> the<00:03:41.209> plate<00:03:41.510> that<00:03:41.689> comes

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:41.959 
there but this is the plate that comes

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:47.349 
there but this is the plate that comes
with<00:03:42.290> the<00:03:42.500> f0<00:03:44.049> head<00:03:45.489> because<00:03:46.489> it's<00:03:46.700> what<00:03:47.209> it's

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:47.359 
with the f0 head because it's what it's

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:50.680 
with the f0 head because it's what it's
trying<00:03:47.540> to<00:03:47.659> do<00:03:47.959> is<00:03:48.290> control<00:03:48.709> the<00:03:48.829> airflow<00:03:49.690> and

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:50.690 
trying to do is control the airflow and

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:54.099 
trying to do is control the airflow and
so<00:03:51.440> it<00:03:51.590> makes<00:03:51.859> it<00:03:52.159> has<00:03:52.970> a<00:03:53.000> larger<00:03:53.780> it's<00:03:53.989> a

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:54.109 
so it makes it has a larger it's a

00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:57.330 
so it makes it has a larger it's a
larger<00:03:54.470> piece<00:03:54.739> so<00:03:55.489> it<00:03:55.639> fits<00:03:55.940> more<00:03:56.180> tightly

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:57.340 
larger piece so it fits more tightly

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:03.759 
larger piece so it fits more tightly
into<00:03:58.340> the<00:04:00.129> the<00:04:01.129> blaster<00:04:01.790> and<00:04:02.349> so<00:04:03.349> you<00:04:03.440> don't

00:04:03.759 --> 00:04:03.769 
into the the blaster and so you don't

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:08.250 
into the the blaster and so you don't
get<00:04:03.889> quite<00:04:04.129> so<00:04:04.489> much<00:04:06.010> turbulence<00:04:07.010> in<00:04:07.159> the<00:04:07.190> air

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:08.260 
get quite so much turbulence in the air

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.949 
get quite so much turbulence in the air
so<00:04:09.260> we're<00:04:09.650> gonna<00:04:09.739> put<00:04:09.980> that<00:04:10.010> on<00:04:10.629> okay<00:04:11.629> what<00:04:11.840> I'm

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:11.959 
so we're gonna put that on okay what I'm

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:15.069 
so we're gonna put that on okay what I'm
pointing<00:04:12.290> out<00:04:12.590> here<00:04:13.299> with<00:04:14.299> the<00:04:14.389> guy<00:04:14.599> got<00:04:14.930> the

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:15.079 
pointing out here with the guy got the

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:17.080 
pointing out here with the guy got the
head<00:04:15.290> off<00:04:15.500> this<00:04:15.799> thing<00:04:16.130> so<00:04:16.489> that<00:04:16.609> you<00:04:16.639> can<00:04:16.880> see

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:17.090 
head off this thing so that you can see

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:20.289 
head off this thing so that you can see
inside<00:04:17.269> and<00:04:17.870> this<00:04:18.530> plate<00:04:18.859> right<00:04:19.160> here<00:04:19.220> you<00:04:20.150> can

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:20.299 
inside and this plate right here you can

00:04:20.299 --> 00:04:24.029 
inside and this plate right here you can
see<00:04:20.510> the<00:04:20.630> clearance<00:04:21.019> between<00:04:21.169> here<00:04:21.620> and<00:04:21.650> here

00:04:24.029 --> 00:04:24.039 
see the clearance between here and here

00:04:24.039 --> 00:04:27.820 
see the clearance between here and here
we're<00:04:25.039> gonna<00:04:25.130> put<00:04:25.370> this<00:04:25.699> plate<00:04:26.090> in<00:04:26.330> there<00:04:26.830> now

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:27.830 
we're gonna put this plate in there now

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:29.080 
we're gonna put this plate in there now
the<00:04:27.860> reason<00:04:28.280> we're<00:04:28.400> putting<00:04:28.639> this<00:04:28.760> one<00:04:28.970> in

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.090 
the reason we're putting this one in

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:31.320 
the reason we're putting this one in
here<00:04:29.270> is<00:04:29.360> it<00:04:29.510> cuts<00:04:29.780> it<00:04:29.930> down<00:04:29.960> some<00:04:30.919> of<00:04:30.949> that

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:31.330 
here is it cuts it down some of that

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:35.320 
here is it cuts it down some of that
space<00:04:33.370> and<00:04:34.370> makes<00:04:34.639> for<00:04:34.849> a<00:04:34.910> little<00:04:35.060> less

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:35.330 
space and makes for a little less

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:39.730 
space and makes for a little less
turbulence<00:04:35.930> in<00:04:36.169> the<00:04:36.770> air<00:04:38.260> so<00:04:39.260> I'll<00:04:39.470> show<00:04:39.710> you

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:39.740 
turbulence in the air so I'll show you

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:44.140 
turbulence in the air so I'll show you
with<00:04:40.010> it<00:04:40.130> on<00:04:41.919> okay<00:04:42.919> here's<00:04:43.220> a<00:04:43.310> look<00:04:43.849> at<00:04:43.970> the

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:44.150 
with it on okay here's a look at the

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:46.420 
with it on okay here's a look at the
plates<00:04:44.539> beside<00:04:45.080> each<00:04:45.110> other<00:04:45.470> obviously<00:04:46.280> this

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:46.430 
plates beside each other obviously this

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:48.250 
plates beside each other obviously this
one's<00:04:46.699> much<00:04:46.880> larger<00:04:47.449> and<00:04:47.570> going<00:04:47.690> to<00:04:47.750> have<00:04:47.930> less

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:48.260 
one's much larger and going to have less

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:50.200 
one's much larger and going to have less
clearance<00:04:48.800> and<00:04:49.280> I'll<00:04:49.370> show<00:04:49.580> you<00:04:49.639> what<00:04:49.880> it<00:04:49.970> like

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:50.210 
clearance and I'll show you what it like

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:52.990 
clearance and I'll show you what it like
looks<00:04:50.720> like<00:04:50.930> when<00:04:51.139> we<00:04:51.260> put<00:04:51.470> it<00:04:51.560> inside<00:04:52.000> okay

00:04:52.990 --> 00:04:53.000 
looks like when we put it inside okay

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.290 
looks like when we put it inside okay
here<00:04:53.990> you<00:04:54.139> can<00:04:54.349> see<00:04:54.620> that<00:04:54.880> inside<00:04:55.880> the<00:04:56.090> burger

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:56.300 
here you can see that inside the burger

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:00.070 
here you can see that inside the burger
you<00:04:56.510> can<00:04:56.659> see<00:04:56.990> the<00:04:57.139> reduced<00:04:57.530> clearance<00:04:59.080> around

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:00.080 
you can see the reduced clearance around

00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:02.950 
you can see the reduced clearance around
between<00:05:00.919> it<00:05:01.310> and<00:05:01.340> a<00:05:01.460> blast<00:05:01.729> tube<00:05:02.060> that's<00:05:02.750> how

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:02.960 
between it and a blast tube that's how

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:04.300 
between it and a blast tube that's how
it's<00:05:03.110> supposed<00:05:03.409> to<00:05:03.500> be<00:05:03.590> set<00:05:03.889> up<00:05:04.039> for<00:05:04.220> these

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:04.310 
it's supposed to be set up for these

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:06.930 
it's supposed to be set up for these
small<00:05:04.580> nozzles

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:06.940 
small nozzles

00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:09.520 
small nozzles
we'll<00:05:07.940> be<00:05:08.090> trying<00:05:08.360> it<00:05:08.569> this<00:05:08.750> way<00:05:09.080> and<00:05:09.379> then

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:09.530 
we'll be trying it this way and then

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:11.499 
we'll be trying it this way and then
there's<00:05:09.740> some<00:05:09.919> more<00:05:10.069> adaptations<00:05:11.030> I<00:05:11.180> can<00:05:11.330> make

00:05:11.499 --> 00:05:11.509 
there's some more adaptations I can make

00:05:11.509 --> 00:05:15.969 
there's some more adaptations I can make
to<00:05:11.720> this<00:05:12.280> burn<00:05:14.349> to<00:05:15.349> make<00:05:15.530> it<00:05:15.680> a<00:05:15.740> little<00:05:15.860> more

00:05:15.969 --> 00:05:15.979 
to this burn to make it a little more

00:05:15.979 --> 00:05:18.639 
to this burn to make it a little more
efficient
