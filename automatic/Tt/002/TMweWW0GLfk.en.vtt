stools<00:00:11.639> and<00:00:12.000> I<00:00:12.210> think<00:00:12.420> the<00:00:12.509> kids<00:00:12.719> will<00:00:12.840> just

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
stools and I think the kids will just

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:15.079 
stools and I think the kids will just
feel<00:00:13.200> like<00:00:13.230> this<00:00:13.590> it<00:00:13.920> feels<00:00:14.040> like<00:00:14.190> our<00:00:14.429> what

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:15.089 
feel like this it feels like our what

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:18.050 
feel like this it feels like our what
exactly<00:00:15.780> it<00:00:16.410> allows<00:00:16.650> that<00:00:16.830> create<00:00:17.130> game<00:00:17.340> we're

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
exactly it allows that create game we're

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.609 
exactly it allows that create game we're
not<00:00:18.180> sure<00:00:18.210> how<00:00:18.630> this<00:00:18.779> is<00:00:18.960> going<00:00:19.109> to<00:00:19.230> power

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
not sure how this is going to power

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:21.080 
not sure how this is going to power
since<00:00:19.980> our<00:00:20.250> teachers<00:00:20.550> are<00:00:20.670> going<00:00:20.789> to<00:00:20.850> make<00:00:20.910> use

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
since our teachers are going to make use

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.359 
since our teachers are going to make use
of<00:00:21.119> this<00:00:21.359> but<00:00:22.140> we<00:00:22.260> know<00:00:22.410> they<00:00:22.560> will<00:00:22.680> live<00:00:23.220> in

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
when you see that they'll figure it out

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.850 
when you see that they'll figure it out
as<00:00:38.579> we<00:00:38.610> go<00:00:38.850> get<00:00:39.239> it<00:00:39.360> there<00:00:39.540> so<00:00:39.960> on<00:00:40.140> what's<00:00:40.559> with

all the rocks well if you take a look at
this<00:00:43.550> those<00:00:44.550> rocks<00:00:44.789> are<00:00:45.000> just<00:00:45.210> being<00:00:45.390> saved

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
this those rocks are just being saved

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.389 
this those rocks are just being saved
for<00:00:46.079> when<00:00:46.469> we<00:00:46.590> go<00:00:46.620> out<00:00:46.980> the<00:00:47.100> learning

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
for when we go out the learning

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.369 
for when we go out the learning
environment<00:00:47.510> where<00:00:48.510> this<00:00:48.750> little<00:00:48.960> area<00:00:49.230> here

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
environment where this little area here

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.049 
environment where this little area here
is<00:00:49.559> going<00:00:49.770> to<00:00:49.829> be<00:00:49.950> filled<00:00:50.219> up<00:00:50.399> with<00:00:50.550> gardens

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
is going to be filled up with gardens

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.049 
is going to be filled up with gardens
and<00:00:51.600> seeing<00:00:52.170> and<00:00:52.739> you<00:00:53.039> know<00:00:53.190> interesting

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
and seeing and you know interesting

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.090 
and seeing and you know interesting
crushed<00:00:54.510> rock<00:00:54.780> and<00:00:55.020> concrete<00:00:55.170> mix<00:00:55.680> and<00:00:55.949> that's

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
crushed rock and concrete mix and that's

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.740 
crushed rock and concrete mix and that's
where<00:00:56.250> it's<00:00:56.340> that<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:57.239> hell<00:00:57.449> is<00:00:57.570> out<00:00:57.690> there

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
where it's that the hell is out there

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.450 
where it's that the hell is out there
they've<00:00:58.140> been<00:00:58.320> seeded<00:00:58.710> now<00:00:58.890> but<00:00:59.250> eventually

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
they've been seeded now but eventually

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.040 
they've been seeded now but eventually
we're<00:00:59.910> also<00:01:00.030> going<00:01:00.180> to<00:01:00.270> be<00:01:00.359> adding<00:01:00.390> into<00:01:00.899> there

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
we're also going to be adding into there

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.510 
we're also going to be adding into there
some<00:01:01.260> sort<00:01:01.440> of<00:01:01.559> seeding<00:01:01.920> probably<00:01:02.399> with

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
some sort of seeding probably with

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.299 
some sort of seeding probably with
limestone<00:01:02.730> blocks<00:01:03.239> or<00:01:03.949> she<00:01:04.949> talked<00:01:05.189> to

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
limestone blocks or she talked to

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:06.800 
limestone blocks or she talked to
Bartman<00:01:05.729> and<00:01:05.880> they<00:01:05.939> said<00:01:06.210> they<00:01:06.330> can<00:01:06.510> create

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
Bartman and they said they can create

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.300 
Bartman and they said they can create
something<00:01:07.049> too<00:01:07.350> so<00:01:07.650> you're<00:01:07.799> not<00:01:07.860> sure<00:01:08.159> we're

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
something too so you're not sure we're

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:10.280 
something too so you're not sure we're
for<00:01:08.430> sure<00:01:08.460> going<00:01:08.790> but<00:01:09.030> yeah<00:01:09.210> there's<00:01:10.080> gonna<00:01:10.200> be

for sure going but yeah there's gonna be

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.810 
for sure going but yeah there's gonna be
some<00:01:10.439> sort<00:01:10.560> of<00:01:10.650> limestone<00:01:10.830> Tex<00:01:11.369> eating<00:01:11.700> up

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
some sort of limestone Tex eating up

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:14.630 
some sort of limestone Tex eating up
there<00:01:12.090> and<00:01:12.950> so<00:01:13.950> this<00:01:14.040> is<00:01:14.189> all<00:01:14.310> going<00:01:14.430> to<00:01:14.490> be<00:01:14.580> a

there and so this is all going to be a

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:15.890 
there and so this is all going to be a
learning<00:01:14.880> environment<00:01:15.119> where<00:01:15.570> teachers<00:01:15.720> can

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
learning environment where teachers can

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.539 
learning environment where teachers can
go<00:01:16.170> out<00:01:16.290> with<00:01:16.409> their<00:01:16.560> kids<00:01:16.770> and<00:01:16.950> teach<00:01:17.130> there
