00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:06.740 
wasn't really sticking to what I was

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.850 
wasn't really sticking to what I was
looking<00:02:07.070> for<00:02:07.310> so<00:02:08.119> I<00:02:08.479> try<00:02:09.080> something<00:02:09.500> else<00:02:09.590> the

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:09.860 
looking for so I try something else the

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.699 
looking for so I try something else the
next<00:02:10.130> morning<00:02:10.310> I<00:02:11.080> wet<00:02:12.080> the<00:02:12.110> hair<00:02:12.380> with<00:02:12.590> the

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:12.709 
next morning I wet the hair with the

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:15.250 
next morning I wet the hair with the
water<00:02:12.980> and<00:02:13.250> then<00:02:13.430> i<00:02:13.640> put<00:02:14.330> a<00:02:14.390> little<00:02:14.510> bit<00:02:14.870> of<00:02:14.930> the

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
water and then i put a little bit of the

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.100 
water and then i put a little bit of the
organic<00:02:16.160> coconut<00:02:17.000> oil<00:02:17.239> now<00:02:17.720> this<00:02:17.930> is<00:02:18.080> the

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:18.110 
organic coconut oil now this is the

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.080 
organic coconut oil now this is the
press<00:02:18.470> oil<00:02:18.800> so<00:02:19.190> this<00:02:19.400> is<00:02:19.430> probably<00:02:19.790> a<00:02:19.970> little

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
press oil so this is probably a little

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.210 
press oil so this is probably a little
bit<00:02:20.330> heavy<00:02:20.690> from<00:02:20.959> the<00:02:21.050> hair<00:02:21.230> so<00:02:21.470> i<00:02:21.530> only<00:02:21.770> use<00:02:22.040> a

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
bit heavy from the hair so i only use a

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.570 
bit heavy from the hair so i only use a
little<00:02:22.760> bit<00:02:23.000> so<00:02:23.780> i<00:02:23.810> just<00:02:24.230> kind<00:02:24.319> of<00:02:24.620> rubbed<00:02:25.430> it

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
little bit so i just kind of rubbed it

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.370 
little bit so i just kind of rubbed it
in<00:02:25.670> my<00:02:25.760> hands<00:02:26.030> and<00:02:26.209> just<00:02:26.390> kind<00:02:26.630> of<00:02:26.720> rubbed<00:02:27.200> it

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:27.380 
in my hands and just kind of rubbed it

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.550 
in my hands and just kind of rubbed it
through<00:02:27.530> the<00:02:27.650> hair<00:02:27.950> and<00:02:28.250> it<00:02:28.430> gave<00:02:28.700> it<00:02:28.940> a<00:02:29.120> really

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
through the hair and it gave it a really

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.420 
through the hair and it gave it a really
weightless<00:02:31.390> moisture<00:02:32.739> in<00:02:33.739> conjunction<00:02:34.280> with

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:34.430 
weightless moisture in conjunction with

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.850 
weightless moisture in conjunction with
the<00:02:34.640> water<00:02:34.880> so<00:02:35.180> that<00:02:35.540> was<00:02:36.230> really<00:02:36.260> working

00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:36.860 
the water so that was really working

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.030 
the water so that was really working
good<00:02:37.220> for<00:02:37.489> me<00:02:37.640> and<00:02:38.209> I<00:02:38.299> like<00:02:38.569> that<00:02:38.930> mixture<00:02:39.769> but

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040 
good for me and I like that mixture but

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:42.190 
good for me and I like that mixture but
it<00:02:40.190> makes<00:02:40.430> a<00:02:40.580> hair<00:02:40.819> smell<00:02:41.390> a<00:02:41.420> little<00:02:41.690> bit<00:02:42.019> with

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
it makes a hair smell a little bit with

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.140
