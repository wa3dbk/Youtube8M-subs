00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.929
 how to make a low site then 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:05.879
 this is a thick beard has 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:07.049
 finally a boat has a diameter more 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:09.300
 that big is it that usually used 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:12.150
 that is to say the 28 mm standard 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.980
 usually to cases all that and then 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.830
 on the Olympic bars if we count 

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:18.510
 not the parts to insert the weights 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.460
 they are anti little higher that 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.279
 on others then already what's the point 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:26.699
 to work with a bar a bigger 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:29.010
 diameter than the that 28 mm that's all 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.750
 just for the grip then after that 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:32.610
 can give a little comfort on the 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.320
 squat or on the squats fronts this 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.780
 kind of thing but hey it's for the 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:40.829
 grip when you're going to work roaming 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:43.410
 vertical their wing or I do not know where 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.789
 the curl for example the blow does it 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.680
 that there is a larger diameter stops 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.219
 many there is finally the catch is going to be 

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:49.770
 much harder 

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:51.600
 you forced a blog about them 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.789
 forearm and finally ben 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.390
 unconsciously by being focused on 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.649
 our exercise 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:00.480
 you will also work a block the grip 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.670
 forearms but without much 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:03.719
 finally realize how to make the trick if 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.630
 you can if you have the opportunity 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.640
 try and you'll see you go 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.080
 you tear your forearms really 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:12.360
 because finally we are in 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.610
 the exercise we are in the thing and that 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.939
 work somewhere without getting 

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.939
 account 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:20.310
 the method that I will offer here 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:23.400
 to make it so low that there is 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.020
 many but hey that's very 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:28.490
 simple i will stay in simplicity 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:30.960
 we already take a basic bar so 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.590
 barbell standards like years as we 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.409
 take to cats 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:38.009
 we simply measure the distance between 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:43.630
 both goals and so it's small goal and 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:47.310
 there at home and are about 38 mm 2 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:50.920
 of diameter so the deal it's going to be 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.270
 pick up a metal tube that is about 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.390
 near the same diameter or slightly 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:58.390
 inferior so I took this one there 

00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:01.509
 it is due to the test of the circle near the du 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:03.939
 38 inside diameter and edu 40 of 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:06.579
 outside diameter and the goal is it going 

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:09.910
 become cropping the small hillocks and of 

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:12.580
 so that the tube enter batteries and 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.380
 vivienne piles without keel and over 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.650
 the small hills and so I you 

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:19.510
 show you have the little goals and the bar 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.069
 beautiful basic who are there who come 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:23.319
 for goals and points usually 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:25.900
 and the goal is going to be to trim that for 

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:27.459
 that your tube without which pile on it and 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:29.019
 that it's good just he 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:31.330
 there is nothing else to do except 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:32.890
 cut out the tube obviously so that they 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:36.280
 be of the right length ie 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:38.319
 the the length of your gap then 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.569
 have necessarily if you have a tube that 

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:42.819
 repack on on both goals and and 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:43.090
 that you have nothing to trim down it's the 

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:44.590
 top 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:46.780
 obviously good against that it's a 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:48.670
 little bit of luck and saw that h 

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.930
 word also on the basis that you're going 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.910
 to make the recovery that you go 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.340
 recover some of the studies at paou 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:56.560
 what on building sites or what or where 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.870
 in your garage so it's not going 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:00.370
 to go back to the pile is the best way to 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.049
 not to get bored has spent three hours at 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:04.420
 look good battery tube is 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:06.730
 just to take something that goes a 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:11.010
 pretty much that's a little bit lower 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:15.700
 and then worked directly at 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:18.609
 close by taking a little bit of 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:23.560
 goals and for that to fill that up so 

00:03:18.609 --> 00:03:25.959
 simply obtain a tube of 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.430
 about the same diameter as the hillock 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:30.069
 is slightly smaller in diameter 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:31.470
 internal and then you deny the goals 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:34.620
 and with a 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:36.090
 finally a voice a surging where or a 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:38.220
 grinder 1 at worst if you do not have 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:40.410
 but hey it is better to the grinder 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:42.870
 as you see there and then you 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:45.450
 cut the battery tube away from the 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:48.090
 two goals and you have you do you have 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:50.700
 more than the laon who is there and that's it 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:52.260
 while a head you can go there 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:55.830
 germs tapping a little bit with a hammer 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:57.360
 like I'm doing it's not bad sign 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:04:01.020
 on the contrary, it means that things are going well 

00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:03.780
 hold if then you really want 

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:06.810
 sealed the screw thing so that 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:08.430
 you have a bar like that for 

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:11.670
 eternity you can even do 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:14.310
 exceed a little bit the tube slightly 

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:16.380
 a little further than the stop and 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:18.480
 then come hammered here so as to 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:21.750
 do like a little trick and for that 

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:23.940
 for the tube to come in by 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:24.880
 on it and that it moves no more 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:27.040
 you 

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:29.620
 make cold pounding iron 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:31.600
 finally here bah good after this 

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:33.250
 you can burst you tried the ring 

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:35.470
 from the heart all the new exercises 

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:38.470
 favorite at the bar the primordial tool 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:40.660
 yes absolutely and that's it if you want 

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:42.280
 see other tutorial of this type there 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:44.050
 take a tour on the site click on 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:46.180
 the link you go in the category 

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:50.520
 material and is there there will be others 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:53.310
 tutorial like his next time I'm going 

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:54.599
 and try to make a lower seat more 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:57.360
 thick again because that's where it's 

00:04:54.599 --> 00:04:59.069
 stroke is 40 mm thick is based 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:00.620
 on the goals and standards found 

00:04:59.069 --> 00:05:03.240
 on most bars now 

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:05.970
 but well, if you want to do something 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:07.860
 even thicker 5 cm bar where 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:10.229
 it's starting to really become difficult 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:12.810
 and that and that kills even more a 

00:05:10.229 --> 00:05:14.250
 finally there is another method 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:16.590
 I will try to show you that in a 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:18.629
 next video that's click on the 

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:20.870
 link take a ride in the hardware has 

00:05:18.629 --> 00:05:20.870
 more
