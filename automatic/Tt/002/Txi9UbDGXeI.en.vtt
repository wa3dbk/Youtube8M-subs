00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.230
 ok we're going back so we want to see that's 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.090
 quite rare once again but at least 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.309
 this time we in the room plan oms 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.809
 roughly where things are going to happen 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:16.410
 so really here on the side of 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.869
 trays 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:22.050
 we will have five different stations 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:24.090
 directly to the side to continue 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.099
 behind on the alert was Molik 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.250
 to finish with a big bench 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.539
 with two stations directly there 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.189
 same thing when we go to dawn at 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.350
 all the town halls if they will fall 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.280
 then we'll go get a section of 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.230
 traditional banquet 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.210
 the star is obviously they are in 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.860
 the corner only two separate toilets so 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.149
 we have people here we want everything 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.600
 just the time to make one 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.719
 second 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.820
 to also do all the bottom side 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:51.030
 so the bar that will really start at 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:54.570
 wall where we are there to go too much 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:56.910
 long here is really maximizing the space 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.250
 countertop so that people can 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.809
 come to end here is the true on the 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.219
 counter and we can keep a 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.690
 open space for people who 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:07.350
 would like to have a drink on their 

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:10.320
 hungry and also obviously the dj aspect 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:14.939
 drops slash castres wise all that there 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:17.549
 is presentation where we are going to have a 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:19.320
 kiosk directly the entry that goes 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.700
 be elevated or before 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.130
 people who are going to be sitting at 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.680
 work either for castrated or for 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.689
 dj who will understand the room at 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:30.060
 great full and to be in the bar 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.299
 also pursue customers during the 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.299
 evening 

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:47.890
 if the coffee really in the space at the bottom 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:50.140
 which is stronger than he can his price 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.880
 stabilized here a large bright space 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:55.600
 with a presence of a great truth to 

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.990
 the entrance so here we would have supports 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.180
 Brottes 

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.320
 with four to five seats for 

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:01.630
 people who would like to take their 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.990
 morning coffee with the sun especially 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:07.030
 during the winter when five more years 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:09.910
 and then we partnered with 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:11.200
 mangas tridon to have a shop a 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.840
 Coffee shop space 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.280
 so they're going to be carpeted big 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.280
 libraries with derivatives 

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:19.569
 it's comics books 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:23.440
 figures and ourselves see some 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:26.730
 clothes we can already see that space 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.750
 is arranged as a condo space 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:32.170
 in what we will do simply 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:34.090
 build in a boat that goes to the east of 

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:37.900
 wall here and then who will do all the 

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:39.519
 world to end the true otherwise 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.290
 castrais uses a beautiful space of a 

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:43.030
 counter before all the machines we 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.220
 we want to in this Nespresso 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:47.680
 either slush machines this is our 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:50.260
 faith konopizza to do everything that is 

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:53.250
 food and we will see two spaces 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:55.060
 of the angel so a space of the angel here 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.459
 that they will have two themes 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.870
 different and that are also practical 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:00.250
 when end competitions are 

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.230
 ghana john the competitions 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:03.700
 stars daughter cases where both 

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:06.090
 teams will be able to have their own 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:08.140
 room that will not enter into communication 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:12.760
 and who on the other side 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:13.650
 but hurry from here with a second room 

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:15.569
 more 

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:17.040
 wider that will be laid out with 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:20.000
 benches the workspaces 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.000
