00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:15.970 
finished filming next thing is a lotion
and<00:02:14.810> I<00:02:14.870> didn't<00:02:15.140> completely<00:02:15.440> finish<00:02:15.799> the

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
and I didn't completely finish the

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.580 
and I didn't completely finish the
entire<00:02:16.280> thing<00:02:16.340> but<00:02:17.299> i<00:02:17.329> did<00:02:17.690> finish<00:02:17.870> most<00:02:18.230> of<00:02:18.440> it

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
entire thing but i did finish most of it

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:21.160 
entire thing but i did finish most of it
like<00:02:18.880> literally<00:02:19.880> the<00:02:20.030> only<00:02:20.150> amount<00:02:20.900> that's

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:21.170 
like literally the only amount that's

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:22.690 
like literally the only amount that's
left<00:02:21.260> is<00:02:21.590> like<00:02:21.739> what's<00:02:21.920> scraped<00:02:22.250> onto<00:02:22.579> the

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700 
left is like what's scraped onto the

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.370 
left is like what's scraped onto the
sides<00:02:22.940> and<00:02:23.209> like<00:02:23.390> stuck<00:02:23.690> to<00:02:23.810> the<00:02:23.900> bottom<00:02:24.049> and<00:02:24.290> i

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:24.380 
sides and like stuck to the bottom and i

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:25.839 
sides and like stuck to the bottom and i
can't<00:02:24.590> really<00:02:24.709> get<00:02:24.890> that<00:02:25.010> out<00:02:25.190> because<00:02:25.670> like

00:02:25.839 --> 00:02:25.849 
can't really get that out because like

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:28.420 
can't really get that out because like
the<00:02:26.120> top<00:02:26.630> is<00:02:26.810> so<00:02:26.959> narrow<00:02:27.200> but<00:02:27.860> i<00:02:27.890> did<00:02:28.250> use

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
the top is so narrow but i did use

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.400 
the top is so narrow but i did use
almost<00:02:28.760> all<00:02:29.030> of<00:02:29.239> it<00:02:29.360> i<00:02:29.390> used<00:02:29.510> most<00:02:29.959> of<00:02:30.110> it<00:02:30.260> and

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.410 
almost all of it i used most of it and

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.580 
almost all of it i used most of it and
it<00:02:31.010> is<00:02:31.040> this<00:02:31.579> barefoot<00:02:32.329> Venus<00:02:32.810> vanilla<00:02:33.260> shake

savers get extra rich body cream and

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.199 
savers get extra rich body cream and
this<00:02:36.860> is<00:02:36.920> what<00:02:37.040> it<00:02:37.069> looks<00:02:37.370> like<00:02:37.640> it's<00:02:37.970> really

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209 
this is what it looks like it's really

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:40.599 
this is what it looks like it's really
cute<00:02:38.510> it's<00:02:38.780> like<00:02:38.840> a<00:02:38.959> glass<00:02:39.290> bottle<00:02:39.799> and<00:02:40.040> it<00:02:40.400> is

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:40.609 
cute it's like a glass bottle and it is

00:02:40.609 --> 00:02:44.080 
cute it's like a glass bottle and it is
pretty<00:02:41.060> expensive<00:02:41.389> it's<00:02:41.930> 2099<00:02:42.590> so<00:02:43.130> it's<00:02:43.250> $21

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.090 
pretty expensive it's 2099 so it's $21

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.180 
pretty expensive it's 2099 so it's $21
but<00:02:44.630> I<00:02:44.660> think<00:02:45.200> it's<00:02:45.350> well<00:02:45.590> worth<00:02:45.799> it<00:02:45.950> like<00:02:46.069> you

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:46.190 
but I think it's well worth it like you

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:47.740 
but I think it's well worth it like you
get<00:02:46.310> a<00:02:46.340> huge<00:02:46.639> amount<00:02:46.790> this<00:02:47.060> took<00:02:47.239> me<00:02:47.299> like<00:02:47.510> two

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
get a huge amount this took me like two

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:51.099 
get a huge amount this took me like two
years<00:02:48.019> to<00:02:48.260> use<00:02:48.410> up<00:02:48.650> and<00:02:48.970> it's<00:02:49.970> from<00:02:50.180> Canada<00:02:50.750> so

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:51.109 
years to use up and it's from Canada so

00:02:51.109 --> 00:02:52.390 
years to use up and it's from Canada so
you<00:02:51.170> probably<00:02:51.530> won't<00:02:51.680> be<00:02:51.829> able<00:02:51.859> to<00:02:52.069> get<00:02:52.250> it

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
you probably won't be able to get it

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.099 
you probably won't be able to get it
like<00:02:52.790> I<00:02:52.940> went<00:02:53.120> to<00:02:53.209> Canada<00:02:53.600> a<00:02:53.630> couple<00:02:53.900> years<00:02:54.049> ago

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:54.109 
like I went to Canada a couple years ago
