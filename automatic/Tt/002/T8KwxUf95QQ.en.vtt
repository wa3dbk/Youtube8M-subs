00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:06.230
 hello how about youtube friends the day of 

00:00:02.959 --> 00:00:09.469
 today I bring you this video where we are going to 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:12.730
 analyze the rom ex fusion this rom is 

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:15.470
 it seems too rome 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:18.590
 sensations so good we're going to 

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:21.830
 analyze it and to start the radio then 

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:24.760
 I change this radio icon and if we 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:24.760
 we open the radio 

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:32.300
 we will have this very similar to that of the 

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:35.710
 rom sensations but this is with a 

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:38.470
 darker shade more black and good 

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:40.700
 it is very good the radio change the icon 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:43.070
 likewise the clock icon change 

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:46.640
 here we can see that it is exactly the 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:48.710
 same clock but only change the 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.660
 watch the superuser as it comes 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.180
 managing what is this to give the 

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:55.270
 superuser permissions the calendar 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:58.310
 It is also exactly the same 

00:00:55.270 --> 00:01:02.540
 only that they changed what is 

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:05.489
 the icon you see is the calendar 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:08.700
 and original 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:10.770
 but they changed the ok icon from there 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.320
 on the outside what is the bar 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:16.290
 notifications because it is very similar 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.869
 but this one is already modifiable 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:22.229
 so if we go to the 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:24.940
 application that is called status bar mode 

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:27.040
 what is this extreme seeing 

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:30.400
 we can open 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:33.630
 and we will be able to make the change to what 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:37.920
 it's been the notification bar 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.920
 Well, if I give it in one color 

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:44.869
 red so to speak you can see it then 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.869
 and in return 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:52.390
 and equally what is the bar 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:55.610
 sorry the curtain of notifications and the 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:57.770
 we have a blue color 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:02.330
 here for example let's put it in a 

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:05.790
 same blue color but let's clarify it 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:08.880
 clarify doing it a little 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:11.190
 see and it's a little bit more transparent 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:13.710
 ok the touches because they changed change is 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:16.830
 this bar the truth is that it is very 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:19.170
 well I like this bar is a little bit 

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:23.040
 more modifiable than that of the rom 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:25.290
 sensation and what else does this have 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:29.490
 has the book does not have books in the 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:31.620
 contact synchronization that is one 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:34.700
 of the ships that I think brought the rom 

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:39.200
 sensation s 5 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:42.709
 and well then brought launchers has the 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:45.050
 original launcher and this one that says kitkat 

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:47.450
 launcher that to me in particular I 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:49.740
 like this this to remove one chair 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:54.230
 it's very good 

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:54.230
 is this this launcher 

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:05.080
 and another of the things that change is this 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:08.020
 this rom was for example if I leave you 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:10.530
 pressed for a few seconds the button 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:13.709
 home or the house as we see the 

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:13.709
 recent applications 

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:22.769
 and see 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:24.749
 here in charge see how it is already like 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:27.510
 Recent applications appear 

00:03:24.749 --> 00:03:30.840
 a different way different ok 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:33.980
 see the truth is that it is very good is 

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:37.560
 very fluid I tried it with many games 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:40.409
 and I tried it with the gel tools and the truth 

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:42.840
 I did not have any problems and I tried it with 

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:45.120
 facebook with synchronization is 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.750
 contacts and then there are not any 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:48.030
 problem 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:51.299
 youtube runs very well and then the truth 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:53.280
 I dare say that this is one of the 

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:55.859
 best roms that has come out for the 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:58.590
 terminal samsung galaxy fame so 

00:03:55.859 --> 00:04:01.199
 good is this rom and I know the 

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:04.919
 I recommend little by little they will go 

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:07.829
 knowing I hope you like this me 

00:04:04.919 --> 00:04:09.900
 He does not believe it but I asked his permission 

00:04:07.829 --> 00:04:12.659
 creator of this rom to be able to draw 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:15.750
 this video and he said yes he was 

00:04:12.659 --> 00:04:18.720
 very well that there was no detail and 

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:23.220
 good another feature is that 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:27.390
 this amplifier has to remove this 

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:29.610
 has this amplifier called dsp 

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:33.420
 manager is now very good this 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:34.910
 amplifier if you give and the power and 

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:38.150
 time to listen to music 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:40.950
 I also change this one of my files 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:43.580
 that was generally yellow this is 

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:45.919
 black let's open it 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:49.310
 and see for example here video images 

00:04:45.919 --> 00:04:54.529
 music documents here how can 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:58.549
 observe then and change 

00:04:54.529 --> 00:05:01.429
 see the truth is that I liked these 

00:04:58.549 --> 00:05:03.919
 small changes that made him and good 

00:05:01.429 --> 00:05:08.089
 What the creator tells me is that he 

00:05:03.919 --> 00:05:10.039
 He did he not the kitchen that he really 

00:05:08.089 --> 00:05:14.569
 what he did was to compile several roms 

00:05:10.039 --> 00:05:16.539
 that he liked and therefore all the 

00:05:14.569 --> 00:05:20.359
 applications that came in other roms 

00:05:16.539 --> 00:05:23.779
 those with juice or together to make 

00:05:20.359 --> 00:05:28.609
 this rom is why he put the 

00:05:23.779 --> 00:05:31.820
 name of an excursion and well the 

00:05:28.609 --> 00:05:34.700
 truth is that I recommend it 

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:37.910
 I hope this video was from his 

00:05:34.700 --> 00:05:40.160
 I hope you like this rom that 

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:41.930
