00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.480 

you<00:00:28.840> should<00:00:29.080> know<00:00:29.260> that<00:00:29.500> the<00:00:29.650> windows<00:00:29.980> 8<00:00:30.130> user

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:30.490 
you should know that the windows 8 user

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:32.159 
you should know that the windows 8 user
experience<00:00:31.180> is<00:00:31.300> going<00:00:31.480> to<00:00:31.540> be<00:00:31.660> vastly

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:32.169 
experience is going to be vastly

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:35.100 
experience is going to be vastly
different<00:00:32.710> from<00:00:32.740> windows<00:00:33.220> 7<00:00:33.700> vista<00:00:34.180> or<00:00:34.330> XP<00:00:34.360> and

different from windows 7 vista or XP and

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:37.620 
different from windows 7 vista or XP and
as<00:00:35.890> we<00:00:36.100> know<00:00:36.130> from<00:00:36.489> the<00:00:36.580> release<00:00:37.030> of<00:00:37.239> Windows

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:37.630 
as we know from the release of Windows

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:40.470 
as we know from the release of Windows
Vista<00:00:37.930> most<00:00:38.650> Windows<00:00:39.070> users<00:00:39.489> despise<00:00:40.030> any

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:40.480 
Vista most Windows users despise any

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.960 
Vista most Windows users despise any
changes<00:00:41.230> to<00:00:41.260> their<00:00:41.559> beloved<00:00:41.980> windows<00:00:42.520> system

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:42.970 
changes to their beloved windows system

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:45.420 
changes to their beloved windows system
so<00:00:43.840> if<00:00:44.020> that<00:00:44.230> makes<00:00:44.470> you<00:00:44.559> already<00:00:45.070> hate

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:45.430 
so if that makes you already hate

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:48.030 
so if that makes you already hate
windows<00:00:45.879> 8<00:00:46.180> then<00:00:46.660> so<00:00:46.989> be<00:00:47.320> it<00:00:47.350> but<00:00:47.890> my

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:48.040 
windows 8 then so be it but my

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.369 
windows 8 then so be it but my
suggestion<00:00:48.550> is<00:00:48.820> to<00:00:48.879> try<00:00:49.390> it<00:00:49.449> learn<00:00:50.050> it<00:00:50.080> and

00:00:50.369 --> 00:00:50.379 
suggestion is to try it learn it and

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:53.040 
suggestion is to try it learn it and
figure<00:00:50.770> it<00:00:50.800> out<00:00:51.100> then<00:00:51.610> judge<00:00:52.030> it<00:00:52.239> because<00:00:52.690> when

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:53.050 
figure it out then judge it because when

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:54.990 
figure it out then judge it because when
it<00:00:53.140> comes<00:00:53.379> to<00:00:53.530> technology<00:00:53.920> the<00:00:54.460> last<00:00:54.730> thing

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:55.000 
it comes to technology the last thing

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.150 
it comes to technology the last thing
you<00:00:55.120> want<00:00:55.360> to<00:00:55.420> do<00:00:55.600> is<00:00:55.780> be<00:00:55.809> resistant<00:00:56.650> to<00:00:56.710> change

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:57.160 
you want to do is be resistant to change

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.100 
you want to do is be resistant to change
because<00:00:57.760> that's<00:00:58.210> when<00:00:58.420> you<00:00:58.510> get<00:00:58.630> left<00:00:58.960> behind

00:00:59.100 --> 00:00:59.110 
because that's when you get left behind

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:01.620 
because that's when you get left behind
that<00:00:59.710> said<00:01:00.070> let's<00:01:00.370> get<00:01:00.579> windows<00:01:00.940> 8<00:01:01.149> up<00:01:01.329> and

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:01.630 
that said let's get windows 8 up and

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:04.020 
that said let's get windows 8 up and
running<00:01:02.050> in<00:01:02.200> my<00:01:02.590> experience<00:01:02.860> when<00:01:03.460> trying<00:01:03.850> out

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:04.030 
running in my experience when trying out

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.120 
running in my experience when trying out
new<00:01:04.059> software<00:01:04.839> it's<00:01:05.199> best<00:01:05.410> to<00:01:05.530> run<00:01:05.740> it<00:01:05.890> in<00:01:06.009> a

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:06.130 
new software it's best to run it in a

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.310 
new software it's best to run it in a
virtual<00:01:06.640> environment<00:01:06.780> so<00:01:07.780> that<00:01:07.810> it<00:01:08.080> doesn't

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:08.320 
virtual environment so that it doesn't

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:10.889 
virtual environment so that it doesn't
screw<00:01:08.710> up<00:01:08.830> your<00:01:09.040> system<00:01:09.490> so<00:01:10.390> we're<00:01:10.570> going<00:01:10.750> to

00:01:10.889 --> 00:01:10.899 
screw up your system so we're going to

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:12.570 
screw up your system so we're going to
install<00:01:11.229> windows<00:01:11.290> 8<00:01:11.830> in<00:01:12.009> a<00:01:12.100> virtual

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:12.580 
install windows 8 in a virtual

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090 
and I know that you're probably thinking

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.690 
and I know that you're probably thinking
what<00:03:07.599> the<00:03:07.659> crap<00:03:08.049> is<00:03:08.079> this<00:03:08.340> well<00:03:09.340> the<00:03:09.430> best<00:03:09.609> way

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
what the crap is this well the best way

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.460 
what the crap is this well the best way
to<00:03:09.849> get<00:03:10.030> over<00:03:10.090> the<00:03:10.420> shock<00:03:10.689> of<00:03:10.750> the<00:03:11.019> interface

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
to get over the shock of the interface

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.890 
to get over the shock of the interface
is<00:03:11.500> not<00:03:11.920> to<00:03:12.099> think<00:03:12.310> of<00:03:12.489> it<00:03:12.609> as<00:03:12.790> a<00:03:12.819> past<00:03:13.329> Windows

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
is not to think of it as a past Windows

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.319 
is not to think of it as a past Windows
release<00:03:14.319> but<00:03:14.890> to<00:03:15.010> think<00:03:15.250> of<00:03:15.430> it<00:03:15.579> more<00:03:15.879> like<00:03:15.940> an

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:16.329 
release but to think of it more like an

00:03:16.329 --> 00:03:19.289 
release but to think of it more like an
iphone<00:03:16.930> or<00:03:17.140> android<00:03:17.319> operating<00:03:17.950> system<00:03:18.400> so

00:03:19.289 --> 00:03:19.299 
iphone or android operating system so

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:21.629 
iphone or android operating system so

it creates for a much more fluid
application<00:03:59.349> launching<00:03:59.829> and<00:03:59.980> better<00:04:00.190> memory
