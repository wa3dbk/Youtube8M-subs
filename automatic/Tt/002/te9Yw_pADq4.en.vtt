00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:04.630
 e.k 

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:07.930
 after what, but how in the hands I am so happy 

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:10.719
 Do you want to see the school? 

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:12.029
 It's not clear yet 

00:00:12.029 --> 00:00:13.300
 whole line 

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:16.450
 the eighth third as explained to him that 

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:19.450
 beauty is true 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:21.929
 to the beginning 

00:00:21.929 --> 00:00:25.730
 but for learning the rules 

00:00:25.729 --> 00:00:27.420
 road behavior 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.720
 and my husband is also very scary for a dollar 

00:00:31.409 --> 00:00:32.800
 maybe they won't do it 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.190
 according to calculations 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:35.930
 in Ukraine, the main term 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.750
 just show what interests you and I 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:40.890
 I will tell you 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.399
 dropped in the room and on the map 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:46.250
 Akopyan even more 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:47.910
 team 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.400
 l 

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.660
 and then 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.320
 this figure fund is intended to 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:55.210
 cars 

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:58.500
 he tells them when i want it on him 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.960
 red cars and parking if not traveling 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.240
 but then he will say 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:09.900
 intersection 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.760
 very dangerous places on the road 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.960
 in no case can not go into 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.960
 crossroads across 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:22.550
 km 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:25.540
 this is a pedestrian traffic light 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:26.340
 he 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.870
 talk to pedestrians 

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:29.600
 then you can cross the road 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.530
 if the green car is on 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.530
 if red 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.120
 but then he will say 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:43.580
 this and pedestrians like us with you science 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.280
 this and those people who did not find either throw 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.570
 one should be very careful so 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:52.570
 not to fall under this case 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:55.180
 and then 

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:56.619
 as I understand it 

00:01:56.619 --> 00:01:57.810
 with her 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.920
 luntik must remember that by no means 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.320
 the case can not alley so the car is 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.119
 can help them end badly driver 

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:09.339
 you may not see their homes 

00:02:09.339 --> 00:02:12.339
 alanya 

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:17.789
 that's just last week ocean knowing 

00:02:17.789 --> 00:02:20.249
 as pedestrians need it 

00:02:20.249 --> 00:02:22.699
 after this sign you can go 

00:02:22.699 --> 00:02:25.599
 road even if not all couples 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:27.579
 you just need to watch carefully 

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:29.139
 does husband have 1 

00:02:29.139 --> 00:02:32.200
 and it is no coincidence that the red light 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:35.169
 and what 

00:02:35.169 --> 00:02:37.509
 it's a dollar 

00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:41.089
 the pavement is for pedestrians only 

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:44.099
 on it should not be borne by customs officers and 

00:02:44.099 --> 00:02:47.099
 walking there is safe 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:49.919
 but then he will say 

00:02:49.919 --> 00:02:52.609
 this is a footpath 

00:02:52.609 --> 00:02:55.750
 that section of the road which is intended 

00:02:55.749 --> 00:02:58.239
 just for pedestrians 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:00.579
 not all roads have such 

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:03.779
 tracks so it should be entertaining 

00:03:03.779 --> 00:03:06.939
 look out on the road idea stylist 

00:03:06.939 --> 00:03:09.699
 track 

00:03:09.699 --> 00:03:10.950
 and then 

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:14.010
 adoption of this document is not lower than 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:14.870
 more no less 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.540
 and therefore you can only walk on the road 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.420
 specially reserved for this 

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.409
 places 

00:03:22.409 --> 00:03:24.489
 but then he will say 

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:26.649
 Italy car 

00:03:26.649 --> 00:03:29.039
 so it was not always necessarily remember 

00:03:29.039 --> 00:03:31.949
 that in no case can not hope that 

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:32.870
 our minutes 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:36.000
 it may end up very badly driver 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.229
 you may not see their homes 

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:41.509
 alanya 

00:03:41.509 --> 00:03:43.219
 m 

00:03:43.219 --> 00:03:44.659
 for what 

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:45.629
 this 

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:49.069
 pedestrian traffic light harold talk 

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:52.069
 pedestrians when you can cross the road 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:55.709
 if it is green but important 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:58.709
 if red 

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:01.419
 but then tell me 

00:04:01.419 --> 00:04:04.069
 This traffic light is intended for 

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:07.579
 machines it tells them when I want 

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:10.849
 if it is red standing on it if 

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:12.499
 no they are going 

00:04:12.499 --> 00:04:14.869
 P 

00:04:14.869 --> 00:04:16.079
 and what 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:17.659
 so pedestrians 

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:19.909
 such as we are with you cartoons 

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:22.909
 in china those people who are not on the machine and 

00:04:22.909 --> 00:04:26.469
 should not be very careful not to 

00:04:26.469 --> 00:04:29.469
 get hit 

00:04:30.779 --> 00:04:32.759
 but then I will tell 

00:04:32.759 --> 00:04:35.029
 the car 

00:04:35.029 --> 00:04:38.109
 Luntik sure to remember that in no way 

00:04:38.109 --> 00:04:41.169
 case you can not hope industrial 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:43.240
 it may help them end badly 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.590
 the driver may not see you at their homes 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:48.490
 straight at her 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:49.710
 our house 

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:52.370
 these are pedestrian crossings 

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:55.060
 it is also called the theater if that 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:56.430
 that he is striped 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:59.180
 these are special places on the road 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:01.660
 with enough that we are her 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:04.500
 go through but go through 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:07.539
 zebra is possible only if there is no 

00:05:07.539 --> 00:05:11.080
 machines book reiter green light demand not 

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:12.460
 to lose 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:13.900
 village 

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:15.800
 she is also considered an analyst 

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:19.039
 the main thing to remember on the road is very dangerous 

00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:23.019
 they need to be very careful and always 

00:05:23.019 --> 00:05:26.019
 to look around 

00:05:31.589 --> 00:05:32.520
 there is still 

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:35.970
 access to them now he as a whole
