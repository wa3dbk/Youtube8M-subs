00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:07.530 

subtracting<00:00:06.009> mixed<00:00:06.160> numbers<00:00:06.310> with<00:00:07.149> uncommon

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:07.540 
subtracting mixed numbers with uncommon

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:10.890 
subtracting mixed numbers with uncommon
denominators<00:00:08.700> in<00:00:09.700> order<00:00:10.030> to<00:00:10.150> do<00:00:10.330> this<00:00:10.510> we<00:00:10.780> can

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:10.900 
denominators in order to do this we can

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:13.289 
denominators in order to do this we can
separate<00:00:11.410> the<00:00:11.770> whole<00:00:12.070> number<00:00:12.430> three<00:00:13.000> and<00:00:13.119> two

00:00:13.289 --> 00:00:13.299 
separate the whole number three and two

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:17.090 
separate the whole number three and two
and<00:00:13.600> the<00:00:13.990> fractions<00:00:14.500> 5<00:00:14.949> /<00:00:15.250> 7<00:00:15.459> and<00:00:15.879> 5<00:00:16.209> volt<00:00:16.480> rate

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
and the fractions 5 / 7 and 5 volt rate

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:24.499 
and the fractions 5 / 7 and 5 volt rate
so<00:00:18.100> we<00:00:18.220> write<00:00:18.400> 3<00:00:18.820> subtract<00:00:19.510> 2<00:00:21.179> 5<00:00:22.179> /<00:00:22.929> 7<00:00:23.369> subtract

00:00:24.499 --> 00:00:24.509 
so we write 3 subtract 2 5 / 7 subtract

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:29.759 
so we write 3 subtract 2 5 / 7 subtract
5<00:00:25.509> /<00:00:26.349> 8<00:00:26.939> now<00:00:27.939> we<00:00:27.970> work<00:00:28.269> on<00:00:28.449> these<00:00:28.720> 2<00:00:29.169> subtraction

00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:29.769 
5 / 8 now we work on these 2 subtraction

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:31.919 
5 / 8 now we work on these 2 subtraction
problems<00:00:30.189> separately<00:00:30.519> let's<00:00:31.480> start<00:00:31.720> with<00:00:31.810> the

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:31.929 
problems separately let's start with the

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:35.580 
problems separately let's start with the
fraction<00:00:32.910> 7<00:00:33.910> &amp;<00:00:34.120> 8<00:00:34.239> are<00:00:34.270> uncommon<00:00:34.870> denominator

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:35.590 
fraction 7 &amp; 8 are uncommon denominator

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:38.880 
fraction 7 &amp; 8 are uncommon denominator
we<00:00:36.190> must<00:00:36.430> have<00:00:36.880> a<00:00:36.910> common<00:00:37.330> denominator<00:00:37.890> when

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:38.890 
we must have a common denominator when

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:41.640 
we must have a common denominator when
subtracting<00:00:39.400> fraction<00:00:39.880> in<00:00:40.150> this<00:00:40.780> case<00:00:41.110> the

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:41.650 
subtracting fraction in this case the

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:44.640 
subtracting fraction in this case the
common<00:00:41.860> denominator<00:00:42.550> would<00:00:42.850> be<00:00:42.910> 56<00:00:43.690> since<00:00:44.050> 7<00:00:44.500> &amp;

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:44.650 
common denominator would be 56 since 7 &amp;

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:48.150 
common denominator would be 56 since 7 &amp;
8<00:00:44.860> can<00:00:45.310> both<00:00:45.490> go<00:00:45.760> into<00:00:45.970> 56<00:00:46.840> so<00:00:47.800> I'm<00:00:47.920> going<00:00:48.100> to

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:48.160 
8 can both go into 56 so I'm going to

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:56.280 
8 can both go into 56 so I'm going to
set<00:00:48.430> our<00:00:48.700> new<00:00:49.000> denominators<00:00:49.810> to<00:00:50.080> be<00:00:50.230> 56<00:00:55.020> 7<00:00:56.020> goes

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:56.290 
set our new denominators to be 56 7 goes

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:59.400 
set our new denominators to be 56 7 goes
into<00:00:56.590> 56<00:00:57.100> 8<00:00:57.610> times<00:00:58.000> so<00:00:58.360> multiply<00:00:58.840> the<00:00:58.900> bottom

00:00:59.400 --> 00:00:59.410 
into 56 8 times so multiply the bottom

00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:07.560 
into 56 8 times so multiply the bottom
by<00:00:59.440> 8<00:00:59.710> and<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.960> top<00:01:02.350> by<00:01:02.530> 8<00:01:02.880> 5<00:01:03.880> times<00:01:04.150> 8<00:01:04.330> is<00:01:04.509> 40<00:01:06.570> 8

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:07.570 
by 8 and the top by 8 5 times 8 is 40 8

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:10.499 
by 8 and the top by 8 5 times 8 is 40 8
goes<00:01:07.840> into<00:01:08.109> 56<00:01:08.619> 7<00:01:08.979> times<00:01:09.159> so<00:01:09.759> I<00:01:09.789> multiply<00:01:10.270> that

00:01:10.499 --> 00:01:10.509 
goes into 56 7 times so I multiply that

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:17.279 
goes into 56 7 times so I multiply that
denominator<00:01:11.320> by<00:01:11.920> 7<00:01:11.979> in<00:01:12.729> the<00:01:13.630> numerator<00:01:13.810> by<00:01:14.740> 7<00:01:16.289> 5

00:01:17.279 --> 00:01:17.289 
denominator by 7 in the numerator by 7 5

00:01:17.289 --> 00:01:23.130 
denominator by 7 in the numerator by 7 5
times<00:01:17.560> 7<00:01:17.950> is<00:01:18.100> 35<00:01:21.179> now<00:01:22.179> we<00:01:22.240> subtract<00:01:22.990> the

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:23.140 
times 7 is 35 now we subtract the

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.489 
times 7 is 35 now we subtract the
fraction<00:01:24.179> our<00:01:25.179> denominator<00:01:25.810> remains<00:01:26.229> the

00:01:26.489 --> 00:01:26.499 
fraction our denominator remains the

00:01:26.499 --> 00:01:34.080 
fraction our denominator remains the
same<00:01:28.049> 40<00:01:29.049> subtract<00:01:29.439> 35<00:01:30.210> is<00:01:31.210> 5<00:01:31.859> 5<00:01:32.859> /<00:01:32.889> 56<00:01:33.759> cannot

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:34.090 
same 40 subtract 35 is 5 5 / 56 cannot

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.749 
same 40 subtract 35 is 5 5 / 56 cannot
be<00:01:34.270> reduced<00:01:34.859> now<00:01:35.859> let's<00:01:36.219> work<00:01:36.369> on<00:01:36.549> the<00:01:36.639> whole

00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:36.759 
be reduced now let's work on the whole

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:41.010 
be reduced now let's work on the whole
number<00:01:37.090> 3<00:01:38.049> subtract<00:01:38.439> 2<00:01:38.649> is<00:01:38.859> 1<00:01:39.159> and<00:01:39.840> then<00:01:40.840> we

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:41.020 
number 3 subtract 2 is 1 and then we

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:42.719 
number 3 subtract 2 is 1 and then we
combine<00:01:41.200> the<00:01:41.590> whole<00:01:41.859> number<00:01:42.249> with<00:01:42.609> the

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:42.729 
combine the whole number with the

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:47.879 
combine the whole number with the
fraction<00:01:43.259> and<00:01:44.259> our<00:01:44.439> resulting<00:01:45.810> answer<00:01:46.810> is<00:01:47.109> 1<00:01:47.560> +

00:01:47.879 --> 00:01:47.889 
fraction and our resulting answer is 1 +

00:01:47.889 --> 00:02:00.990 
fraction and our resulting answer is 1 +
5<00:01:48.840> /<00:01:49.859> 56<00:01:50.859> and<00:01:51.179> this<00:01:52.179> completes<00:01:52.569> our<00:01:52.719> problem
