00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:05.350
 ah 

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:07.210
 numbers boys girls that such as 

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:08.860
 you are welcome to another break of mine is 

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:10.780
 a news video where I want 

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:12.519
 echoing a news that has come out 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:14.379
 by the corning company 

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:16.990
 because he has presented us with a new 

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:18.820
 crystal that of course the crystals 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:21.220
 that makes corn and the gorilla glass is 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.690
 they mount on all smartphones but 

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.570
 right now he has released a pretty 

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:26.530
 interesting with sapphire crystal but 

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:28.480
 guys let's start at the beginning 

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:30.910
 you know that I like to analyze everything in 

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:32.770
 perspective the truth is that in 2006 

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:35.020
 approximately when apple was 

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:36.310
 working on your first iphone the true 

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:38.710
 is that I knew that the screen was the most 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:40.600
 important that's why I talk to corbin with 

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.070
 a company specializing in crystals 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.170
 to make a crystal 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:46.180
 robust enough that for not 

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:48.130
 it did not break easily the 

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:51.730
 iphone screen so in this case 

00:00:48.130 --> 00:00:53.320
 Well, if it gave you a hard blow, not in that 

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:54.820
 moment with no certain is that he said 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.559
 that I could not do it but good at the end 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:58.989
 they worked together with Paul and 

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:00.790
 corning and they managed to create the crystal 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:02.469
 of gorilla glass that today is the 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:04.540
 that all smartphones screens 

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:08.080
 they are riding of course you know 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:10.120
 Sobradamente that is very resistant I do not know 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:11.770
 and it's quite resistant to shock is 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.810
 a strong blow may not be 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:15.700
 break depends on the strength you apply in 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.950
 the blow but before all the rumors that 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:20.200
 they came from iphone 6 in the past what 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:21.790
 true is that corning said how good 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:24.400
 you remove the sapphire crystal was not the 

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:27.040
 best alloy to make a frontal 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:29.050
 a mobile screen because maybe it was not 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.210
 as resistant as the glass gorilla that 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:33.790
 it was better and such and such not then in 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:36.280
 November the ghost corning replied 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:39.040
 taking out a crystal that was taken with the 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.600
 grass 4 that was the natural evolution a 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.310
 much more resistant than glass 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.350
 that we know not now and 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:46.600
 surely the next devices already 

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:48.160
 will have this this gorilla glass 4 but 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.990
 guys recently the company 's 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:52.000
 corning has taken a new crystal a 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:54.729
 new project parallel to the gorilla sails 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.560
 that would be called project field that would be 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:01:58.630
 the same crystal of all life that 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.180
 he has smartphones but this time with 

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:03.369
 sapphire crystal they assure that it is 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:05.410
 very resistant the most resistant of 

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:07.330
 moment and also that they are not scratched or 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:09.010
 therefore surely in the future 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.149
 we could have even more than 

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:12.160
 abandon the gorilla grass 

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:14.350
 I think we could have two types of 

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:16.750
 smartphones or the high- end 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:19.030
 in this glass film and then the range 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.100
 medium-low that could incorporate the 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.900
 gorilla glass 4 because remember that 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.430
 currently all the smartphones of 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.440
 low-end mid-range high- end 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.420
 has the same glass gorilla glass 3 

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:30.220
 good as it is coordinates despite 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.720
 who said in the past that crystal of 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.820
 This reef was not the best alloy 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.160
 it seems that he has lowered his pants and 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:37.810
 that has taken out a project at the end 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.460
 quite cool quite interesting and 

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:41.380
 that surely all of us 

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:43.030
 users picks of smartphones we're going 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.440
 to see benefited within a little 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:46.660
 because this year the next 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.460
 devices will already start to carry this 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:50.500
 new alloy this new screen the 

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:53.380
 fia and of course there will be as many 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:55.210
 that they will use with class 4 that is for 

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:57.490
 supposedly more resistant than the known 

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:58.680
 formerly guys I do not know what you think 

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:00.580
 the news I think it's pretty 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.410
 hopeful for all those who 

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:04.120
 we suffer and we do not want that when 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:06.340
 we drop our cell phone or get hit 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.290
 the screen is broken like many I 

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:09.100
 I included it has happened to me fired me guys 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.720
 I hope you liked the 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:12.250
 information you already know if you give me a 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:14.290
 like new ones to see so you want him the 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:17.550
 day and nothing that you already know we see in the 

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:17.550
