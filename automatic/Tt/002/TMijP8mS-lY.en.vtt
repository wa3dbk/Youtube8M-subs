the<00:01:02.140> sniper<00:01:02.379> rifles<00:01:02.799> as<00:01:03.129> I<00:01:03.159> am<00:01:03.489> in<00:01:03.820> the<00:01:03.940> game

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:07.720 
looks quite good with them but they just

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.030 
looks quite good with them but they just
don't<00:01:08.440> interest<00:01:08.799> me

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:09.040 
don't interest me

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.160

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:12.270 
as much as an assault rifle or spun

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.280 
laser because it's really not a

requested that they needed it so I did

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:51.030 
requested that they needed it so I did
my<00:01:48.880> best<00:01:48.910> so<00:01:49.660> from<00:01:50.140> the<00:01:50.260> Helu<00:01:50.500> I<00:01:50.710> had<00:01:50.830> to<00:01:50.920> use

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:51.040 
my best so from the Helu I had to use

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.210 
my best so from the Helu I had to use
the<00:01:51.130> halo<00:01:51.310> 3<00:01:52.080> sniper<00:01:53.080> rifle<00:01:53.470> which<00:01:53.590> is<00:01:53.740> in<00:01:53.860> its

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:54.220 
the halo 3 sniper rifle which is in its

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:55.860 
the halo 3 sniper rifle which is in its
full<00:01:54.460> size<00:01:54.670> as<00:01:54.970> the<00:01:55.210> dimensions<00:01:55.690> and

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:55.870 
full size as the dimensions and

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:59.160 
full size as the dimensions and
measurements<00:01:56.290> to<00:01:56.409> help<00:01:57.659> understand<00:01:58.659> what<00:01:58.990> the

00:01:59.160 --> 00:01:59.170 
measurements to help understand what the

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:01.290 
measurements to help understand what the
width<00:01:59.380> and<00:01:59.620> the<00:01:59.740> sizes<00:02:00.610> are<00:02:00.760> and<00:02:01.030> the<00:02:01.090> length

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:01.300 
width and the sizes are and the length

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:02.730 
width and the sizes are and the length
of<00:02:01.540> this<00:02:01.690> because<00:02:02.080> I<00:02:02.170> couldn't<00:02:02.409> actually

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
of this because I couldn't actually

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.170 
of this because I couldn't actually
complete<00:02:03.130> the<00:02:03.280> whole<00:02:03.430> head<00:02:03.700> we<00:02:03.790> reach<00:02:03.940> sniper

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:04.180 
complete the whole head we reach sniper

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.060 
complete the whole head we reach sniper
and<00:02:04.360> build<00:02:04.540> the<00:02:04.630> barrels<00:02:04.990> as<00:02:05.470> I<00:02:05.620> have<00:02:05.770> to<00:02:05.860> send

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:06.070 
and build the barrels as I have to send

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:08.009 
and build the barrels as I have to send
it<00:02:06.190> to<00:02:06.220> America<00:02:06.729> and<00:02:06.909> I<00:02:07.150> can't<00:02:07.390> send<00:02:07.690> a<00:02:07.780> giant

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:08.019 
it to America and I can't send a giant

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:09.089 
it to America and I can't send a giant
possible<00:02:08.590> with<00:02:08.739> that

00:02:09.089 --> 00:02:09.099 
possible with that

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:11.009 
possible with that
so<00:02:09.519> they'll<00:02:09.729> assemble<00:02:10.239> the<00:02:10.390> rest<00:02:10.569> of<00:02:10.720> the<00:02:10.840> gun

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:11.019 
so they'll assemble the rest of the gun

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:15.479 
so they'll assemble the rest of the gun
and<00:02:11.290> in<00:02:11.890> America<00:02:12.459> on<00:02:13.890> the<00:02:14.890> premises<00:02:15.250> of<00:02:15.310> the

00:02:15.479 --> 00:02:15.489 
and in America on the premises of the

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:17.580 
and in America on the premises of the
film<00:02:15.700> and<00:02:15.940> that<00:02:16.930> means<00:02:17.079> I<00:02:17.139> have<00:02:17.260> to<00:02:17.379> worry

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
film and that means I have to worry

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.170 
film and that means I have to worry
about<00:02:17.769> it<00:02:17.920> but<00:02:18.129> all<00:02:18.400> I've<00:02:18.549> had<00:02:18.639> to<00:02:18.760> do<00:02:18.879> is<00:02:18.999> fill

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:19.180 
about it but all I've had to do is fill

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.400 
about it but all I've had to do is fill
the<00:02:19.299> hole

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:21.410 
the hole

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:23.630 
the hole
integrity<00:02:22.410> of<00:02:22.470> the<00:02:22.650> gun<00:02:22.800> that<00:02:22.980> holds<00:02:23.310> all<00:02:23.490> the

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:23.640 
integrity of the gun that holds all the

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.760 
integrity of the gun that holds all the
extra<00:02:23.880> barrels<00:02:24.210> so<00:02:24.930> without<00:02:25.140> any<00:02:25.320> further<00:02:25.440> ado

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:25.770 
extra barrels so without any further ado

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:27.770 
extra barrels so without any further ado
here's<00:02:26.610> been<00:02:26.790> able<00:02:26.940> to<00:02:27.030> reach<00:02:27.180> sniper<00:02:27.420> rifle

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
here's been able to reach sniper rifle

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.300 
here's been able to reach sniper rifle
now<00:02:28.020> of<00:02:28.140> course<00:02:28.320> it's<00:02:28.590> been<00:02:28.710> made<00:02:28.890> of<00:02:29.010> started

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
now of course it's been made of started

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:30.770 
now of course it's been made of started
from<00:02:29.430> as<00:02:29.610> well<00:02:29.760> and<00:02:29.940> I've<00:02:30.000> given<00:02:30.120> my<00:02:30.390> own<00:02:30.510> kind

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
from as well and I've given my own kind

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.080 
from as well and I've given my own kind
of<00:02:30.930> little<00:02:31.200> paint<00:02:31.410> job<00:02:31.680> to<00:02:31.860> it<00:02:31.980> to<00:02:32.580> make<00:02:32.910> it

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
of little paint job to it to make it

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.210 
of little paint job to it to make it
look<00:02:33.420> a<00:02:33.570> bit<00:02:33.630> our<00:02:33.990> own<00:02:34.230> so<00:02:34.590> we're<00:02:34.710> not<00:02:34.770> exact

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
look a bit our own so we're not exact

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.060 
look a bit our own so we're not exact
replicating<00:02:35.880> the<00:02:36.000> gun<00:02:36.150> but<00:02:36.530> it<00:02:37.530> has<00:02:37.710> been<00:02:37.890> done

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:38.070 
replicating the gun but it has been done

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:40.520 
replicating the gun but it has been done
so<00:02:38.250> quite<00:02:38.520> a<00:02:38.550> high<00:02:38.790> standard<00:02:39.210> I<00:02:39.630> achieved<00:02:40.320> the

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530 
so quite a high standard I achieved the

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.060 
so quite a high standard I achieved the
curves<00:02:40.800> in<00:02:41.130> the<00:02:41.190> detail<00:02:41.550> that<00:02:41.580> I<00:02:41.850> needed<00:02:42.150> and

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:43.070 
curves in the detail that I needed and

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:46.220 
curves in the detail that I needed and
I'm<00:02:44.070> quite<00:02:44.340> happy<00:02:44.460> with<00:02:44.700> it<00:02:44.840> they<00:02:45.840> also<00:02:45.990> made

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
I'm quite happy with it they also made

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:47.630 
I'm quite happy with it they also made
the<00:02:46.260> feature<00:02:46.530> so<00:02:46.830> that<00:02:46.980> it<00:02:47.130> can<00:02:47.310> come<00:02:47.490> with

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:47.640 
the feature so that it can come with

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.640 
the feature so that it can come with
interchangeable<00:02:47.870> magazine<00:02:48.870> so<00:02:49.110> about<00:02:49.320> three

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:49.650 
interchangeable magazine so about three

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.130 
interchangeable magazine so about three
different<00:02:49.740> ones<00:02:50.010> that<00:02:50.250> we<00:02:50.340> can<00:02:50.780> switch<00:02:51.780> in

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:52.140 
different ones that we can switch in

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.840 
different ones that we can switch in
between<00:02:52.170> the<00:02:52.710> gun<00:02:52.890> when<00:02:53.130> we<00:02:53.250> need<00:02:53.400> to<00:02:53.430> and

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
between the gun when we need to and

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:56.420 
between the gun when we need to and
we'll<00:02:54.810> find<00:02:55.050> out<00:02:55.290> some<00:02:55.590> way<00:02:55.860> to<00:02:55.890> keep<00:02:56.040> it<00:02:56.340> in

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
we'll find out some way to keep it in

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.310 
we'll find out some way to keep it in
there<00:02:56.610> using<00:02:57.150> magnets<00:02:57.690> once<00:02:57.870> it<00:02:57.990> gets<00:02:58.110> over<00:02:58.200> to

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
there using magnets once it gets over to

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.620 
there using magnets once it gets over to
America<00:02:58.800> but<00:02:59.459> otherwise<00:02:59.700> it's<00:03:00.120> in<00:03:00.209> its<00:03:00.420> full

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:00.630 
America but otherwise it's in its full

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:03.800 
America but otherwise it's in its full
size<00:03:00.870> and<00:03:01.320> it<00:03:01.500> works<00:03:01.680> out<00:03:01.890> quite<00:03:02.070> nicely<00:03:02.810> the

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
size and it works out quite nicely the

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.600 
size and it works out quite nicely the
detail<00:03:04.200> is<00:03:04.380> that<00:03:04.709> has<00:03:04.800> been<00:03:04.980> put<00:03:05.190> into<00:03:05.310> it<00:03:05.490> was

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610 
detail is that has been put into it was

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.250 
detail is that has been put into it was
quite<00:03:05.880> painstaking<00:03:06.510> unfortunately<00:03:07.050> because

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
quite painstaking unfortunately because

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:08.780 
quite painstaking unfortunately because
I<00:03:07.350> had<00:03:07.500> to<00:03:07.620> rush<00:03:07.860> this<00:03:08.100> job<00:03:08.310> because<00:03:08.580> I'm<00:03:08.670> we

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
I had to rush this job because I'm we

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.120 
I had to rush this job because I'm we
need<00:03:08.940> to<00:03:09.030> get<00:03:09.150> over<00:03:09.330> to<00:03:09.570> America<00:03:09.990> stop<00:03:10.770> filming

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
need to get over to America stop filming

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:14.180 
need to get over to America stop filming
the<00:03:11.880> fan<00:03:12.090> film<00:03:12.360> one<00:03:12.540> I<00:03:13.200> didn't<00:03:13.890> get<00:03:14.010> to<00:03:14.070> spend

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190 
the fan film one I didn't get to spend

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:15.770 
the fan film one I didn't get to spend
as<00:03:14.310> much<00:03:14.490> time<00:03:14.550> as<00:03:14.760> I<00:03:14.940> would<00:03:15.120> have<00:03:15.180> liked<00:03:15.480> on<00:03:15.630> it

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:15.780 
as much time as I would have liked on it

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:19.430 
as much time as I would have liked on it
but<00:03:16.110> overall<00:03:17.209> it's<00:03:18.209> about<00:03:18.360> 70<00:03:18.990> percent<00:03:19.140> of<00:03:19.320> my

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440 
but overall it's about 70 percent of my

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.020 
but overall it's about 70 percent of my

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:21.030 
efforts which may not look quite nice

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:23.000 
efforts which may not look quite nice
and<00:03:21.450> on<00:03:21.600> camera<00:03:22.020> that's<00:03:22.500> gonna<00:03:22.680> look<00:03:22.860> even

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010
