00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:23.669
 blonde or blonde and have the problem that 

00:00:21.419 --> 00:00:26.250
 usually now in summer or in 

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:28.590
 winter if we go to indoor pools to 

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.529
 cause of the pool water can we 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:34.530
 appear in blond hair about 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.270
 very ugly green reflections 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.520
 this is due to some products that 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:42.120
 put in the water to keep it as is the 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:44.460
 chlorine or anti algae personally this 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.980
 summer I had that problem myself 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.380
 means to tips that the area more clarita 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:52.500

 problem can happen with either hair 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.070
 dyed or with natural hair because I 

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:04.199
 I remember that as a little girl I also 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.049
 I went by and did not paint or make myself 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.720
 wicks or anything and it's more common the more 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:11.670

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.890
 to tell a homemade trick that you can 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:16.440
 do from home so that those reflections 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.820
 greenish ones go completely without 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.500

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.890

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:28.620
 strong for the hair by 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:31.500
 ingredients you'll use after 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:33.260

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.180

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:38.160
 pretty rough but for this case 

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:40.560
 I also have another trick that is a 

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:42.810
 homemade mask that will work very 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.370
 well in this case so stay 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.590
 watching the video and taking note 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:50.020
 first let's create a kind of 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:52.090
 exfoliant based on bicarbonate and the 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:53.920
 juice of a lemon measures for a 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:56.290
 long hair are 4 tablespoons of 

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.940
 baking soda and a whole lemon and if 

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:00.100
 you have short hair because half 

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:01.870
 You can also add a spoonful of 

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:04.320
 your mask to protect a 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:04.320
 bit 

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:18.980
 ah 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:27.269
 now we create 4 partitions and in cap 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:30.170
 generously each strand with the mixture 

00:02:27.269 --> 00:02:30.170
 what have we done 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:43.440
 [Music] 

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.310
 We wrap with aluminum foil and 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:56.999
 we do the same with the rest 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:56.999
 [Music] 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.170
 Y 

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:24.490
 once we have it, we let it act 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.350
 about 30 to 40 minutes and you can also 

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:28.840
 apply a little heat so that 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:30.730
 act faster while we can go 

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:33.330
 preparing the other mask with a 

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:33.330
 egg white 

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:43.520
 and two tablespoons of olive oil this 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:43.520
 will nourish and soften the hair cuticle 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:51.470
 i 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:54.280
 well then after the 30 

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:57.130
 or 40 minutes rinse 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:59.140
 and we apply the mask ideally 

00:03:57.130 --> 00:04:01.120
 let him act for 10 minutes 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:03.580
 the longer the better 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:05.560
 while we can relax reading 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:06.420
 a book or take advantage to paint us 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:12.760
 the ones 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:12.760
 [Music] 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.439
 rinse pnas 

00:04:16.549 --> 00:04:21.669
 and we wash our hair like we do 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:21.669
 usually 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:30.400
 and ready goodbye to those greenish reflections 

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:32.560
 I hope you liked it and that you 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:32.890
