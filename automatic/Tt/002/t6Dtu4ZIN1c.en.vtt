of being able to obtain any firearms

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.670 
of being able to obtain any firearms
especially<00:02:44.580> in<00:02:44.670> this<00:02:44.820> case<00:02:45.680> semi-automatic

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
especially in this case semi-automatic

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.130 
especially in this case semi-automatic
firearms<00:02:47.340> there<00:02:47.820> is<00:02:48.000> a<00:02:48.030> move<00:02:48.420> by<00:02:48.450> the<00:02:48.780> gun

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:49.140 
firearms there is a move by the gun

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.270 
firearms there is a move by the gun
grabbers<00:02:49.680> in<00:02:49.860> Congress<00:02:50.370> to<00:02:50.520> try<00:02:50.790> to<00:02:50.850> ban

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:52.280 
grabbers in Congress to try to ban

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:54.650 
grabbers in Congress to try to ban
semi-automatic<00:02:53.280> firearms<00:02:53.970> or<00:02:54.180> certain

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
semi-automatic firearms or certain

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.230 
semi-automatic firearms or certain
semi-automatic<00:02:55.100> firearm<00:02:56.100> but<00:02:56.610> they<00:02:56.820> probably

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:57.240 
semi-automatic firearm but they probably

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:59.870 
semi-automatic firearm but they probably
will<00:02:57.720> not<00:02:57.930> get<00:02:58.320> very<00:02:58.620> far<00:02:58.770> with<00:02:59.250> this<00:02:59.370> proposal

00:02:59.870 --> 00:02:59.880 
will not get very far with this proposal

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:02.150 
will not get very far with this proposal
because<00:03:00.540> there<00:03:00.900> simply<00:03:01.110> is<00:03:01.410> not<00:03:01.650> public

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 
because there simply is not public

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.880 
because there simply is not public
support<00:03:02.550> for<00:03:02.610> it<00:03:03.060> so<00:03:03.660> the<00:03:03.930> gun<00:03:04.170> grabbers<00:03:04.650> then

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
support for it so the gun grabbers then

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:06.590 
support for it so the gun grabbers then
would<00:03:05.100> rely<00:03:05.430> on<00:03:05.670> their<00:03:05.820> boy<00:03:06.030> in<00:03:06.270> the<00:03:06.360> White
