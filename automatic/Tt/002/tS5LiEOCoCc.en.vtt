00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.620 
as well and a little bit of pattern on
the<00:02:29.650> back<00:02:29.830> spacer<00:02:30.340> there<00:02:30.550> this<00:02:31.300> is<00:02:31.480> actually

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:31.630 
the back spacer there this is actually

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:33.930 
the back spacer there this is actually
the<00:02:31.990> original<00:02:32.140> back<00:02:33.070> spacer<00:02:33.550> that<00:02:33.580> was<00:02:33.820> in

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
the original back spacer that was in

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:37.440 
the original back spacer that was in
there<00:02:34.090> so<00:02:34.300> this<00:02:34.480> is<00:02:34.630> just<00:02:34.870> plastic<00:02:35.940> now<00:02:36.940> I<00:02:36.970> was

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
there so this is just plastic now I was

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:42.570 
there so this is just plastic now I was
gonna<00:02:37.630> make<00:02:37.900> a<00:02:37.930> back<00:02:38.200> spacer<00:02:38.710> but<00:02:40.920> the<00:02:41.920> screws

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
gonna make a back spacer but the screws

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.240 
gonna make a back spacer but the screws
on<00:02:43.060> both<00:02:43.120> of<00:02:43.630> these<00:02:43.720> screw<00:02:44.290> into<00:02:44.710> a<00:02:44.740> metal

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
on both of these screw into a metal

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.240 
on both of these screw into a metal
piece<00:02:45.400> that's<00:02:45.730> like<00:02:46.300> pressed<00:02:46.810> into<00:02:47.250> the

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
piece that's like pressed into the

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.150 
piece that's like pressed into the
plastic<00:02:48.760> liner<00:02:49.000> so<00:02:49.540> under<00:02:50.470> the<00:02:50.590> plastic<00:02:51.010> back

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:51.160 
plastic liner so under the plastic back

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.780 
plastic liner so under the plastic back
spacer<00:02:51.640> and<00:02:52.140> I<00:02:53.140> don't<00:02:53.350> know<00:02:53.590> I<00:02:53.830> thought<00:02:54.670> about

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
spacer and I don't know I thought about

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:56.940 
spacer and I don't know I thought about
just<00:02:55.420> pulling<00:02:55.840> it<00:02:55.960> out<00:02:56.110> and<00:02:56.140> pressing<00:02:56.470> it<00:02:56.800> into

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:56.950 
just pulling it out and pressing it into

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:59.510 
just pulling it out and pressing it into
another<00:02:57.130> piece<00:02:57.580> of<00:02:57.610> g10<00:02:58.030> or<00:02:58.210> something<00:02:58.480> but

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 
another piece of g10 or something but

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:01.800 
another piece of g10 or something but
this<00:03:00.520> works<00:03:00.790> I<00:03:00.970> think<00:03:01.000> it<00:03:01.240> looks<00:03:01.390> pretty<00:03:01.540> good

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:07.440 
this works I think it looks pretty good
I<00:03:03.120> think<00:03:04.120> it<00:03:04.330> work<00:03:04.450> looks<00:03:04.720> pretty<00:03:04.990> good<00:03:05.200> so<00:03:06.450> so

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:07.450 
I think it work looks pretty good so so

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:44.920 
can see that stuff even sticks out

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.360 
can see that stuff even sticks out
perfect<00:03:46.020> and<00:03:47.020> I<00:03:47.110> didn't<00:03:47.470> even<00:03:47.590> tear<00:03:47.890> the<00:03:48.070> bumps

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:48.370 
perfect and I didn't even tear the bumps

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:53.400 
perfect and I didn't even tear the bumps
off<00:03:48.540> sometimes<00:03:49.540> I<00:03:49.750> I<00:03:50.050> do<00:03:50.980> that<00:03:52.110> hey<00:03:53.110> it's<00:03:53.350> a

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:53.410 
off sometimes I I do that hey it's a

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:55.020 
off sometimes I I do that hey it's a
learning<00:03:53.620> process<00:03:53.770> I<00:03:54.310> think<00:03:54.370> I'm<00:03:54.700> getting<00:03:54.970> a

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.030 
learning process I think I'm getting a

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:58.410 
learning process I think I'm getting a
lot<00:03:55.209> better<00:03:55.390> though<00:03:56.820> but<00:03:57.820> this<00:03:57.970> thing<00:03:58.209> just

00:03:58.410 --> 00:03:58.420 
lot better though but this thing just

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:00.180 
lot better though but this thing just
turned<00:03:58.540> out<00:03:58.750> absolutely<00:03:58.900> amazing<00:03:59.650> and<00:03:59.950> what's

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:00.190 
turned out absolutely amazing and what's

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:02.850 
turned out absolutely amazing and what's
unique<00:04:00.610> about<00:04:00.730> this<00:04:01.030> one<00:04:01.209> too<00:04:01.420> is<00:04:01.630> I<00:04:01.810> know<00:04:02.709> it's

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:02.860 
unique about this one too is I know it's

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:04.020 
unique about this one too is I know it's
hard<00:04:03.010> to<00:04:03.100> see<00:04:03.280> in<00:04:03.370> there<00:04:03.520> but<00:04:03.700> you<00:04:03.880> actually

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:04.030 
hard to see in there but you actually

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:05.910 
hard to see in there but you actually
don't<00:04:04.420> have<00:04:04.540> to<00:04:04.690> middle<00:04:05.140> this<00:04:05.290> liner<00:04:05.620> at<00:04:05.800> all

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:05.920 
don't have to middle this liner at all

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:07.800 
don't have to middle this liner at all
usually<00:04:06.160> you<00:04:06.459> have<00:04:06.580> to<00:04:06.640> mill<00:04:07.090> the<00:04:07.120> liner<00:04:07.540> down

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:07.810 
usually you have to mill the liner down

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:11.160 
usually you have to mill the liner down
just<00:04:08.050> a<00:04:08.140> bit<00:04:08.580> to<00:04:09.580> get<00:04:09.670> some<00:04:09.730> this<00:04:10.420> lock<00:04:10.720> bar<00:04:10.959> to

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:11.170 
just a bit to get some this lock bar to

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:14.759 
just a bit to get some this lock bar to
go<00:04:11.260> back<00:04:11.470> a<00:04:11.500> little<00:04:11.769> but<00:04:12.030> but<00:04:13.030> this<00:04:13.180> one<00:04:13.769> it's

00:04:14.759 --> 00:04:14.769 
go back a little but but this one it's

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:18.000 
go back a little but but this one it's
just<00:04:14.830> the<00:04:15.070> washers<00:04:15.489> clearance<00:04:15.940> enough<00:04:17.010> so

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.010 
just the washers clearance enough so

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:22.050 
just the washers clearance enough so
that's<00:04:18.160> cool<00:04:18.419> and<00:04:19.419> this<00:04:19.600> blade<00:04:19.930> is<00:04:21.000> it's<00:04:22.000> a

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:22.060 
that's cool and this blade is it's a

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:24.900 
that's cool and this blade is it's a
little<00:04:22.330> bit<00:04:22.890> it's<00:04:23.890> a<00:04:23.979> little<00:04:24.010> bit<00:04:24.280> off-center

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:24.910 
little bit it's a little bit off-center

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:27.900 
little bit it's a little bit off-center
but

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:27.910 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:30.640 

it's<00:04:28.910> nice<00:04:29.090> and<00:04:29.479> this<00:04:30.199> is<00:04:30.260> one<00:04:30.530> of<00:04:30.560> those

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:30.650 
it's nice and this is one of those

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:32.680 
it's nice and this is one of those
pivots<00:04:31.070> that<00:04:31.280> you<00:04:31.430> actually<00:04:31.639> tighten<00:04:32.419> all<00:04:32.660> the

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:32.690 
pivots that you actually tighten all the

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:36.129 
pivots that you actually tighten all the
way<00:04:32.990> down<00:04:33.199> and<00:04:33.440> it<00:04:33.560> just<00:04:33.590> it<00:04:34.040> just<00:04:34.220> holds<00:04:35.139> so

00:04:36.129 --> 00:04:36.139 
way down and it just it just holds so

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:40.930 
way down and it just it just holds so
that's<00:04:36.889> kind<00:04:37.100> of<00:04:37.160> cool<00:04:39.340> and<00:04:40.340> once<00:04:40.550> I<00:04:40.639> tighten

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:40.940 
that's kind of cool and once I tighten
