night on Thanksgiving night mom goes

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.160 
night on Thanksgiving night mom goes
into<00:00:28.949> labor<00:00:29.279> she<00:00:29.580> goes<00:00:30.449> to<00:00:30.720> the<00:00:30.750> hospital

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
into labor she goes to the hospital

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.170 
into labor she goes to the hospital
there<00:00:31.380> was<00:00:31.470> a<00:00:31.529> skeleton<00:00:32.070> crew<00:00:32.099> her<00:00:32.640> doctors

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
there was a skeleton crew her doctors

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.090 
there was a skeleton crew her doctors
not<00:00:33.360> there<00:00:33.630> and<00:00:33.930> bam<00:00:34.260> I<00:00:34.469> come<00:00:34.649> out<00:00:34.800> he<00:00:34.920> comes

out and then dr. looks my mom it says
there's<00:00:37.890> something<00:00:38.190> else<00:00:38.280> in<00:00:38.460> there<00:00:38.489> no<00:00:39.180> so

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:40.280

there's something else in there no so
then<00:00:41.280> I<00:00:41.430> and<00:00:41.820> then<00:00:41.879> I<00:00:42.059> like<00:00:42.239> um<00:00:42.480> I'm<00:00:42.750> not<00:00:42.840> really

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
then I and then I like um I'm not really

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:44.360 
then I and then I like um I'm not really
initially<00:00:43.379> but<00:00:43.710> they<00:00:43.890> get<00:00:44.040> me<00:00:44.160> going

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
initially but they get me going

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:45.799 
initially but they get me going
eventually<00:00:44.700> they<00:00:45.030> get<00:00:45.239> him<00:00:45.360> go<00:00:45.450> you<00:00:45.539> can<00:00:45.660> see

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
brain damage all right I thought about

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:51.080 
brain damage all right I thought about
what<00:00:49.890> my<00:00:50.010> life<00:00:50.039> would<00:00:50.370> be<00:00:50.399> like<00:00:50.520> without<00:00:50.760> this

what my life would be like without this
guy<00:00:51.270> right<00:00:51.449> I<00:00:51.510> don't<00:00:51.719> like<00:00:51.870> it<00:00:52.020> well<00:00:52.620> I<00:00:52.649> would

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
guy right I don't like it well I would

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.279 
guy right I don't like it well I would
like<00:00:53.129> a<00:00:53.610> life<00:00:53.760> because<00:00:54.600> I<00:00:54.870> mean<00:00:55.050> you<00:00:55.140> think

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
like a life because I mean you think

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.830 
like a life because I mean you think
about<00:00:55.620> he's<00:00:56.190> always<00:00:56.370> been<00:00:56.550> my<00:00:56.699> by<00:00:57.059> my<00:00:57.090> side<00:00:57.420> so

we<00:01:11.159> both<00:01:11.310> went<00:01:11.820> into<00:01:12.180> engineering<00:01:12.450> because<00:01:13.320> we

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
we both went into engineering because we

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.289 
we both went into engineering because we
both<00:01:13.680> love<00:01:13.740> science<00:01:14.490> mathematics<00:01:14.640> apply<00:01:15.240> to

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
both love science mathematics apply to

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.719 
both love science mathematics apply to
real<00:01:15.540> world<00:01:15.750> situations<00:01:16.380> I<00:01:16.590> felt<00:01:17.250> like<00:01:17.430> in<00:01:17.670> the

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
real world situations I felt like in the

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.690 
real world situations I felt like in the
sciences<00:01:18.720> the<00:01:19.380> more<00:01:19.650> I<00:01:19.680> understood<00:01:20.100> about<00:01:20.310> the

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
sciences the more I understood about the

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.179 
sciences the more I understood about the
world<00:01:20.939> and<00:01:21.420> how<00:01:21.689> things<00:01:21.930> worked<00:01:22.320> just<00:01:22.830> fell

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
world and how things worked just fell

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:24.679 
world and how things worked just fell
like<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.400> more<00:01:23.610> I<00:01:23.640> understood<00:01:23.939> myself<00:01:24.119> in<00:01:24.600> a

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
like the more I understood myself in a

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:27.830 
like the more I understood myself in a
way<00:01:24.810> I<00:01:25.020> saw<00:01:25.439> engineering<00:01:25.979> and<00:01:26.130> saw<00:01:26.600> what<00:01:27.600> type

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
way I saw engineering and saw what type

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.390 
way I saw engineering and saw what type
of<00:01:27.869> careers<00:01:28.320> it<00:01:28.470> would<00:01:28.590> lead<00:01:28.770> to<00:01:28.799> and<00:01:29.250> just

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
of careers it would lead to and just

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.450 
of careers it would lead to and just
immediately<00:01:29.790> knew<00:01:30.060> I<00:01:30.090> want<00:01:30.329> to<00:01:30.390> do<00:01:30.570> it<00:01:31.460> ditto

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
immediately knew I want to do it ditto

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.420 
immediately knew I want to do it ditto
on<00:01:32.490> that<00:01:33.350> just<00:01:34.350> so<00:01:34.500> many<00:01:34.710> I<00:01:34.829> mean<00:01:34.860> I'm<00:01:35.100> in<00:01:35.400> a

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
on that just so many I mean I'm in a

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:37.310 
on that just so many I mean I'm in a
calm<00:01:35.579> investors<00:01:36.150> I<00:01:36.270> called<00:01:36.540> my<00:01:36.689> mentors<00:01:37.140> I

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
calm investors I called my mentors I

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.819 
calm investors I called my mentors I
think<00:01:37.950> of<00:01:38.009> them<00:01:38.100> as<00:01:38.250> measures<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:39.000> amount<00:01:39.150> of

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:39.829 
think of them as measures the amount of

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:41.929 
think of them as measures the amount of
involvement<00:01:40.829> they<00:01:41.040> get<00:01:41.159> their<00:01:41.280> students<00:01:41.700> into

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
involvement they get their students into
