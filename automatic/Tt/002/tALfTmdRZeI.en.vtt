00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
and we'll see what happens I mean it's

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.630 
and we'll see what happens I mean it's
it's<00:03:25.660> a<00:03:25.750> much<00:03:25.930> bigger<00:03:26.200> event<00:03:26.770> and<00:03:27.069> there's<00:03:27.580> a

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:27.640 
it's a much bigger event and there's a

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.870 
it's a much bigger event and there's a
lot<00:03:27.760> of<00:03:27.790> pressure<00:03:28.060> I<00:03:29.370> think<00:03:30.370> that<00:03:30.700> there's

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:30.880 
lot of pressure I think that there's

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:32.370 
lot of pressure I think that there's
definitely<00:03:31.030> going<00:03:31.480> to<00:03:31.510> be<00:03:31.660> some<00:03:31.870> hype<00:03:32.020> around

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:32.380 
definitely going to be some hype around

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:34.470 
definitely going to be some hype around
him<00:03:32.620> in<00:03:32.800> the<00:03:32.890> 1080<00:03:33.280> and<00:03:33.520> that<00:03:33.700> he's<00:03:33.819> 12<00:03:34.150> and

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
him in the 1080 and that he's 12 and

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.900 
him in the 1080 and that he's 12 and
just<00:03:35.230> this<00:03:35.319> little<00:03:35.620> prodigy<00:03:36.370> kid<00:03:36.670> that's

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910 
just this little prodigy kid that's

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:39.900 
just this little prodigy kid that's
never<00:03:37.180> really<00:03:37.630> been<00:03:37.840> I<00:03:38.140> mean<00:03:38.890> his<00:03:39.010> first<00:03:39.310> real

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:39.910 
never really been I mean his first real

00:03:39.910 --> 00:03:42.420 
never really been I mean his first real
like<00:03:40.240> big<00:03:40.480> event<00:03:40.750> was<00:03:40.900> X<00:03:41.140> and<00:03:41.350> Asia<00:03:41.560> so

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:42.430 
like big event was X and Asia so

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:44.940 
like big event was X and Asia so
honestly<00:03:43.420> at<00:03:43.660> this<00:03:43.840> point<00:03:43.930> I<00:03:44.440> don't<00:03:44.740> think

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:44.950 
honestly at this point I don't think

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:49.400 
honestly at this point I don't think
anybody<00:03:45.490> really<00:03:45.820> expects<00:03:46.180> anything<00:03:46.420> from<00:03:46.570> him
