area<00:02:51.359> in<00:02:51.570> the<00:02:51.750> tank<00:02:52.340> it's<00:02:53.340> about<00:02:53.810> 14<00:02:54.810> inches

00:02:55.069 --> 00:02:55.079 
area in the tank it's about 14 inches

wide and 36 inches long and I figured

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.809 
wide and 36 inches long and I figured
that<00:03:00.709> there's<00:03:01.709> about<00:03:01.980> an<00:03:02.160> inch<00:03:02.400> in<00:03:03.090> here<00:03:03.930> where

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:04.819 
that there's about an inch in here where

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:08.150 
that there's about an inch in here where
it'll<00:03:05.819> burn<00:03:06.090> at<00:03:06.480> a<00:03:06.569> steady<00:03:06.930> rate<00:03:07.049> if<00:03:07.859> it<00:03:08.010> drops

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
it'll burn at a steady rate if it drops

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:10.280 
it'll burn at a steady rate if it drops
below<00:03:08.459> that<00:03:08.790> it<00:03:09.180> starts<00:03:09.540> going<00:03:09.690> down<00:03:09.989> and

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
below that it starts going down and

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:14.000 
below that it starts going down and
comes<00:03:10.799> above<00:03:11.100> that<00:03:11.340> that's<00:03:11.850> coming<00:03:12.209> up<00:03:13.010> the

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:14.010 
comes above that that's coming up the

oil<00:03:14.190> in<00:03:14.400> this<00:03:14.489> tank<00:03:14.760> will<00:03:15.630> take<00:03:15.840> about<00:03:15.989> three

00:03:16.309 --> 00:03:16.319 
oil in this tank will take about three

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:18.800 
oil in this tank will take about three
hours<00:03:16.350> to<00:03:16.829> drop<00:03:17.069> that<00:03:17.100> one<00:03:17.609> inch<00:03:17.850> it<00:03:18.510> burns

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
hours to drop that one inch it burns

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.509 
hours to drop that one inch it burns
about<00:03:19.139> three-quarters<00:03:19.739> of<00:03:19.769> a<00:03:19.920> gal<00:03:20.100> in<00:03:20.130> an<00:03:20.370> hour

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
about three-quarters of a gal in an hour

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:24.979 
about three-quarters of a gal in an hour
and<00:03:21.470> as<00:03:22.470> you<00:03:22.680> can<00:03:22.859> see<00:03:23.209> it's<00:03:24.209> pretty<00:03:24.450> high<00:03:24.660> I've

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:24.989 
and as you can see it's pretty high I've

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:27.710 
and as you can see it's pretty high I've

got a non-contact thermometer here and

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.319 
got a non-contact thermometer here and
I'll<00:03:27.870> put<00:03:28.109> in<00:03:29.100> the<00:03:29.280> heat<00:03:29.549> exchanger<00:03:29.670> here

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:30.329 
I'll put in the heat exchanger here

00:03:30.329 --> 00:03:32.090 
I'll put in the heat exchanger here
right<00:03:30.959> now<00:03:31.109> we've<00:03:31.319> got<00:03:31.440> nine<00:03:31.470> hundred<00:03:32.040> and
