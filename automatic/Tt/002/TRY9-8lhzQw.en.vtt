00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:24.260 
but there's some technical reasons that

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:25.510 
but there's some technical reasons that
when<00:00:24.440> you<00:00:24.500> look<00:00:24.680> at<00:00:24.800> a<00:00:24.830> speaker<00:00:25.250> okay<00:00:25.490> a

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:25.520 
when you look at a speaker okay a

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.180 
when you look at a speaker okay a
speaker's<00:00:26.000> a<00:00:26.060> speaker<00:00:26.449> that<00:00:26.480> you<00:00:26.630> may<00:00:26.840> not

speaker's a speaker that you may not
understand<00:00:28.190> why<00:00:28.400> it's<00:00:28.640> so<00:00:28.910> nice<00:00:29.119> now<00:00:29.420> let's

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:30.260 
understand why it's so nice now let's

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:31.750 
understand why it's so nice now let's
look<00:00:30.350> at<00:00:30.470> the<00:00:30.590> wolf<00:00:30.800> it's<00:00:31.010> a<00:00:31.039> 12<00:00:31.279> inch<00:00:31.430> woofer

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:31.760 
look at the wolf it's a 12 inch woofer

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:33.430 
look at the wolf it's a 12 inch woofer
but<00:00:31.910> what<00:00:32.059> we<00:00:32.180> have<00:00:32.419> is<00:00:32.750> we<00:00:32.870> use<00:00:32.989> two<00:00:33.199> voice

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:33.440 
but what we have is we use two voice

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.710 
but what we have is we use two voice
courses<00:00:33.920> that<00:00:33.980> have<00:00:34.100> one<00:00:34.309> all<00:00:35.090> speakers<00:00:35.570> have

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:35.720 
courses that have one all speakers have

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:37.479 
courses that have one all speakers have
a<00:00:35.809> voice<00:00:35.989> coil<00:00:36.350> and<00:00:36.590> that's<00:00:36.829> what<00:00:37.010> goes<00:00:37.220> back

00:00:37.479 --> 00:00:37.489 
a voice coil and that's what goes back

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:39.220 
a voice coil and that's what goes back
and<00:00:37.730> forth<00:00:37.940> and<00:00:38.090> makes<00:00:38.239> a<00:00:38.360> sound<00:00:38.630> we<00:00:38.809> use<00:00:38.840> two

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:39.230 
and forth and makes a sound we use two

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:40.510 
and forth and makes a sound we use two
instead<00:00:39.500> of<00:00:39.620> one<00:00:39.829> so<00:00:40.010> that's<00:00:40.160> double<00:00:40.370> the

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:40.520 
instead of one so that's double the

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:42.639 
instead of one so that's double the
handling<00:00:40.850> power<00:00:41.059> we<00:00:41.870> also<00:00:42.050> have<00:00:42.290> a<00:00:42.320> server

00:00:42.639 --> 00:00:42.649 
handling power we also have a server

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:45.220 
handling power we also have a server
circuit<00:00:43.190> which<00:00:43.309> is<00:00:43.340> a<00:00:43.460> base<00:00:43.700> circuit<00:00:44.180> so<00:00:44.840> one

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:45.230 
circuit which is a base circuit so one

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:47.590 
circuit which is a base circuit so one
coil<00:00:45.500> goes<00:00:45.710> forward<00:00:46.100> one<00:00:46.250> pulls<00:00:46.520> it<00:00:46.700> back<00:00:46.910> so

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:47.600 
coil goes forward one pulls it back so

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.090 
coil goes forward one pulls it back so
it's<00:00:47.719> extremely<00:00:47.899> strong<00:00:48.500> so<00:00:48.559> when<00:00:48.920> people

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100 
it's extremely strong so when people

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:50.860 
it's extremely strong so when people
hear<00:00:49.430> this<00:00:49.640> they<00:00:49.760> think<00:00:49.820> it's<00:00:50.120> a<00:00:50.239> 15<00:00:50.690> as

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:50.870 
hear this they think it's a 15 as

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:52.660 
hear this they think it's a 15 as

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:54.440 
and a much bigger sound much more power

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.830

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
tweeter that it's a 300 watt is that

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:27.480 
tweeter that it's a 300 watt is that
correct<00:02:26.530> I<00:02:26.620> don't<00:02:26.770> what<00:02:26.860> but<00:02:26.980> that's<00:02:27.130> not<00:02:27.310> all

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:27.490 
correct I don't what but that's not all

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:29.070 
correct I don't what but that's not all
here's<00:02:27.880> the<00:02:28.030> other<00:02:28.120> thing<00:02:28.240> about<00:02:28.480> the<00:02:28.870> state

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
here's the other thing about the state

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.410 
here's the other thing about the state
of<00:02:29.110> it<00:02:29.320> you<00:02:29.680> have<00:02:29.770> two<00:02:29.980> inputs<00:02:30.460> you<00:02:30.640> are<00:02:30.940> with

00:02:31.410 --> 00:02:31.420 
of it you have two inputs you are with

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.380 
of it you have two inputs you are with
separate<00:02:31.780> volume<00:02:32.080> controls<00:02:32.500> both<00:02:33.400> our<00:02:33.640> combo

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:34.390 
separate volume controls both our combo

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:36.240 
separate volume controls both our combo
jacks<00:02:34.630> they<00:02:34.780> have<00:02:34.870> a<00:02:34.900> quarter<00:02:35.230> or<00:02:35.380> XOR<00:02:35.800> so<00:02:36.160> you

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:36.250 
jacks they have a quarter or XOR so you

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.040 
jacks they have a quarter or XOR so you
can<00:02:36.370> plug<00:02:36.550> a<00:02:36.790> line<00:02:37.330> into<00:02:37.600> and<00:02:37.690> you<00:02:37.750> can<00:02:37.900> plug<00:02:38.020> a

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050 
can plug a line into and you can plug a

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:40.560 
can plug a line into and you can plug a
microphone<00:02:38.260> into<00:02:38.530> it<00:02:38.910> and<00:02:39.910> then<00:02:40.090> it<00:02:40.120> also<00:02:40.360> has

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:40.570 
microphone into it and then it also has

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:42.750 
microphone into it and then it also has
a<00:02:40.630> DSP<00:02:40.990> section<00:02:41.650> so<00:02:41.860> what<00:02:42.040> it<00:02:42.130> has<00:02:42.160> is<00:02:42.490> we<00:02:42.640> have

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:42.760 
a DSP section so what it has is we have

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:44.340 
a DSP section so what it has is we have
a<00:02:42.790> button<00:02:43.360> that<00:02:43.480> will<00:02:43.570> optimize<00:02:44.020> the

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
a button that will optimize the

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:45.870 
a button that will optimize the
equalization<00:02:44.710> for<00:02:45.100> either<00:02:45.190> voice<00:02:45.460> or<00:02:45.760> music

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:45.880 
equalization for either voice or music

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.900 
equalization for either voice or music
okay<00:02:46.660> we<00:02:47.080> have<00:02:47.350> some<00:02:47.560> kind<00:02:47.800> of<00:02:47.830> leveler<00:02:48.340> which

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
okay we have some kind of leveler which

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:50.790 
okay we have some kind of leveler which
adds<00:02:49.210> us<00:02:49.540> every<00:02:49.840> speakers<00:02:50.230> it<00:02:50.380> gets<00:02:50.500> louder

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:50.800 
adds us every speakers it gets louder

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:53.190 
adds us every speakers it gets louder
they<00:02:51.160> get<00:02:51.280> more<00:02:51.430> bassy<00:02:51.730> err<00:02:52.030> well<00:02:52.660> sometimes

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.200 
they get more bassy err well sometimes

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.960 
they get more bassy err well sometimes
you<00:02:53.290> don't<00:02:53.320> want<00:02:53.500> that<00:02:53.860> let's<00:02:54.100> hear<00:02:54.280> a<00:02:54.340> DJ<00:02:54.760> and

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
you don't want that let's hear a DJ and

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:56.280 
you don't want that let's hear a DJ and
you're<00:02:55.060> doing<00:02:55.300> cocktail<00:02:55.750> hour<00:02:55.930> you<00:02:56.200> don't

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290 
you're doing cocktail hour you don't

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.320 
you're doing cocktail hour you don't
want<00:02:56.470> that<00:02:56.560> too<00:02:56.830> much<00:02:56.980> bass<00:02:57.250> you<00:02:57.610> don't<00:02:57.760> rock

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:58.330 
want that too much bass you don't rock

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:00.330 
want that too much bass you don't rock
that<00:02:58.540> uh<00:02:58.570> I'll<00:02:59.350> see<00:02:59.500> you<00:02:59.560> put<00:02:59.710> the<00:02:59.800> leveler<00:03:00.160> on

00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:00.340 
that uh I'll see you put the leveler on

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.160 
that uh I'll see you put the leveler on
so<00:03:00.520> you<00:03:00.580> can<00:03:00.670> get<00:03:00.790> a<00:03:00.820> volume<00:03:01.360> without<00:03:01.720> too<00:03:02.050> much

there's a blank plate on the back of it
what's<00:03:16.540> this<00:03:16.630> plate<00:03:16.900> for<00:03:17.170> we<00:03:17.860> have<00:03:17.980> modules

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
what's this plate for we have modules

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.670 
what's this plate for we have modules
coming<00:03:18.790> out<00:03:18.940> probably<00:03:19.360> by<00:03:19.570> June<00:03:19.870> where<00:03:20.590> you

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
coming out probably by June where you

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.440 
coming out probably by June where you
can<00:03:20.800> have<00:03:20.920> three<00:03:21.250> more<00:03:21.459> inputs<00:03:21.880> to<00:03:22.090> it<00:03:22.240> so

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:22.450 
can have three more inputs to it so

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:23.910 
can have three more inputs to it so
you'll<00:03:22.630> have<00:03:22.840> you<00:03:23.560> have<00:03:23.650> the<00:03:23.740> two<00:03:23.890> inputs

you'll have you have the two inputs

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.160 
you'll have you have the two inputs
already<00:03:24.580> so<00:03:25.060> you<00:03:25.150> have<00:03:25.240> three<00:03:25.510> more<00:03:25.690> chat<00:03:26.020> on

already so you have three more chat on

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.520 
already so you have three more chat on
