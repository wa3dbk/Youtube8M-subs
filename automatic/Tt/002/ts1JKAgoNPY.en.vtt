00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:06.450
 it's going to play species to create the 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:09.480
 buzz so that dan if it's still a 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.139
 crazy thing if they play good but ok they 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.049
 will have to keep 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.910
 he will play without training truth of 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:16.529
 same as a heading implicated on the 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.109
 field for six weeks 

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:20.670
 it's a crazy thing I it's true 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:21.180
 that more and more he did not do his 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.830
 team 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.289
 I do not know if he will play because 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.660
 because sincerely for om is playing it 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.670
 if he will be burnt after a quarter 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.990
 of time 6 cream very very good what you 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.420
 will kill if they were substitutes for 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.530
 the man so if he was replaced everything to 

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:36.120
 the hour he parked on Thursday 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:39.270
 will reuse to you eric and who can 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:39.510
 to be passing or not me I do not know 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:40.980
 me 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.500
 already from the beginning I think it's 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:44.489
 of the intox to put the pressure on 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.070
 the om or course 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:49.469
 that's it and then when we have ten 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:53.309
 convictions this is the tannery as 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.660
 it is maryse precisely me I do it 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.250
 put in danger despite all this guy 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:57.239
 remember thiago silva he lost not 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.320
 does not act as a step because they 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.600
 did it they would have joined other 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.890
 cars and that he did not taste the 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.940
 big problem that he wanted him 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.710
 just returned from the world cup a 

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:06.000
 thiago silva island lost during i know 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.590
 not how long so take a 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.570
 risk like that to play against the om 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:21.509
 that means for me that means he 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:23.159
 is shitting above zero but the people who 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:26.580
 listen to us speak as we and his 

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:28.110
 it's more serious when I say that 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.939
 but say stop the big words but 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.890
 it's pretty nice to say that's okay it wants 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.390
 to say that more than part of being afraid 

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.130
 does that mean you understand what I want 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.420
 to say it's with his cream this is it 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.420
 fear poor rural sector 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.540
 how then explain that me but 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.770
 in all this all this barnum around them 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.600
 the ton and the fact that they were doing it 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.430
 you have to play just real risk 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.720
 to lie down but I speak yes but me 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.579
 I pass a morality of vampires to 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.409
 hands games of anthony kim is no longer a 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:56.670
 rational reason to what is going on there 

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:58.079
 if just the media is no longer 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.100
 in the field of the rational to the new 

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:00.780
 dilemma that's why I tell you 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.730
 that we actually turn for nothing so 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.690
 been threatened paris is killed 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:06.920
 paris i mean everybody has it 

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:08.930
 do I try to make buzz do 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.580
 speak to say nothing we are in 

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:11.900
 this society we are in this world 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.940
 so me there is one that surprises me in 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:16.930
 this approach had to me compared to 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:19.100
 match after his mistakes sincerely 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.210
 psg without waiting it's not the same 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.650
 team simply 

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:23.210
 so I do not think they're scared 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:25.040
 they just want that 

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:27.710
 expect to win then if we knew 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:30.860
 scissors not scary it means that without 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:32.030
 him ie that without doing it with 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:32.450
 him on that date for that they are 

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.430
 best 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.860
 yes that with all that means it's 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.270
 a team of two in wood and that he 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:42.380
 would communicate like that if he was also 

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:44.000
 on two and if he was actually I want 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:44.420
 to tell how you've been doing for a 

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.130
 week 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:51.200
 send tweets ten years he will do 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:52.670
 shake the reasons for their city agreement 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.620
 is also sure of his strength from his state of 

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:56.060
 you shape your strength and where you have you 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.440
 kill you by the person like that 

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.550
 because I'm far away here I can 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.650
 tell you that the tweets he will look after in 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:02.810
 the locker room they know very well and they 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.770
 know very well that a guy has taken over 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.870
 training yesterday 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:07.640
 able for six weeks who 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.200
 support this theme is closed and you know 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:11.480
 very well that when you're heavy teasing 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.470
 need to do a lot of physics a 

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:13.910
 little more physics 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:15.980
 those guys who play on the intentions 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:17.630
 of power he knows very well that this 

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:22.870
 type there will not be there is not 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:22.870
 bluff cc lineage all of that
