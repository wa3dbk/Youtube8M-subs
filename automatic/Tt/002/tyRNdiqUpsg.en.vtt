00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:09.230
 the poetry books and the novels photos 

00:00:03.509 --> 00:00:09.230
 planets that it rains 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.860
 the one that such goals as they are I hope that 

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:16.869
 are very good today I bring you 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:18.820
 a secret of jeta 5 quite cool 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:20.980
 you will remember that a while ago 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:23.170
 he uploaded a video talking to Uncle Sam 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:26.200
 racist that was a typical gringo that 

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:28.450
 he said we should not go to the US that the 

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:30.730
 land is for Americans after 

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:33.010
 I spoke with a Mexican who told us 

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:35.320
 experience the discrimination that they have 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:37.390
 done by simply being Latino 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.489
 just be Mexican maybe you guys 

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.710
 are not so familiar with the subject 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:43.449
 but what happens a lot is that there 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:46.120
 people who get into the army of 

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:48.519
 us and after the war are left 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:51.250
 traumatized like anyone who 

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:53.620
 live very strong things deaths see 

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:55.989
 friends of yours die on the battlefield 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.430
 they are logically wrong of the head and 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:59.860
 then the government does not pay them a 

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:02.049
 psychological treatment the people do not 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:05.019
 does nothing for them it is very common that 

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:06.400
 when you go to the USA you see people there 

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:09.340
 who are asking for money and says 

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:11.110
 vietnam veteran or soldier or something like that 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:12.790
 Of course some are frauds 

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.110
 like here in Mexico in the ladies that 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:15.850
 they take the baby and the baby is 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:16.550
 crying that they give them money because 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.070
 they have 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:21.170
 that is really a fucking business 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.820
 I know that in the USA there are people 

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.340
 fraudulent as anywhere 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:27.290
 lying people who just try 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.360
 benefit from compassion but 

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:32.480
 right now we'll be seeing what we 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:35.030
 count a guy or a veteran who was the 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:37.130
 war in my opinion is that because he speaks 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.320
 a lot of the war is pretty good the 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:40.730
 message that we try to rockstar and 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.500
 something that also made me pretty 

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:44.330
 curious is that I always step 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.340
 exploring the game and had not seen 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.800

 jeta 5 and until now nobody had 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.070
 found I'm going to stay quiet for 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:57.460
