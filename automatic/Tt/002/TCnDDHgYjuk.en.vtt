00:01:14.669 --> 00:01:14.679 
like this I was impressed right out of

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:16.380 
like this I was impressed right out of
the<00:01:14.800> box<00:01:15.039> so<00:01:15.610> I'll<00:01:15.729> show<00:01:15.909> you<00:01:15.940> the<00:01:16.240> unboxing

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:16.390 
the box so I'll show you the unboxing

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:19.169 
the box so I'll show you the unboxing
video<00:01:16.899> overtop<00:01:17.530> of<00:01:17.560> what<00:01:17.830> I'm<00:01:17.950> talking<00:01:18.399> but<00:01:18.970> um

00:01:19.169 --> 00:01:19.179 
video overtop of what I'm talking but um

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:20.999 
video overtop of what I'm talking but um
I<00:01:19.390> mean<00:01:19.840> it's<00:01:19.990> simple<00:01:20.170> straight<00:01:20.619> to<00:01:20.710> the<00:01:20.800> point

00:01:20.999 --> 00:01:21.009 
I mean it's simple straight to the point

00:01:21.009 --> 00:01:23.820 
I mean it's simple straight to the point
easy<00:01:21.340> to<00:01:21.550> use<00:01:21.909> and<00:01:22.170> there's<00:01:23.170> no<00:01:23.380> confusing

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:23.830 
easy to use and there's no confusing

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:26.160 
easy to use and there's no confusing
cords<00:01:24.340> you<00:01:24.520> get<00:01:24.759> so<00:01:25.630> as<00:01:25.690> you'll<00:01:25.840> see<00:01:25.960> from<00:01:25.990> the

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:26.170 
cords you get so as you'll see from the

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:27.930 
cords you get so as you'll see from the
unboxing<00:01:26.560> video<00:01:26.830> you<00:01:26.979> get<00:01:27.159> the<00:01:27.310> cord<00:01:27.580> to<00:01:27.759> help

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:27.940 
unboxing video you get the cord to help

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:30.570 
unboxing video you get the cord to help
charge<00:01:28.210> this<00:01:28.420> into<00:01:28.840> the<00:01:28.929> USB<00:01:29.409> and<00:01:29.649> essentially

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:30.580 
charge this into the USB and essentially

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:33.690 
charge this into the USB and essentially
you<00:01:30.759> get<00:01:30.909> two<00:01:31.319> USB<00:01:32.319> output<00:01:33.220> so<00:01:33.399> that<00:01:33.429> way<00:01:33.640> you

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:33.700 
you get two USB output so that way you

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:35.580 
you get two USB output so that way you
could<00:01:33.880> charge<00:01:34.119> two<00:01:34.420> things<00:01:34.690> simultaneously

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:35.590 
could charge two things simultaneously

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:37.529 
could charge two things simultaneously
the<00:01:35.950> problem<00:01:36.280> with<00:01:36.369> a<00:01:36.399> lot<00:01:36.610> of<00:01:36.640> a<00:01:36.970> lot<00:01:37.210> of<00:01:37.240> these

00:01:37.529 --> 00:01:37.539 
the problem with a lot of a lot of these

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:40.830 
the problem with a lot of a lot of these
portable<00:01:38.200> chargers<00:01:38.679> is<00:01:38.860> that<00:01:39.149> you<00:01:40.149> only<00:01:40.360> get

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:40.840 
portable chargers is that you only get

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.320 
portable chargers is that you only get
one<00:01:41.440> so<00:01:42.100> you<00:01:42.190> can't<00:01:42.459> do<00:01:42.580> two<00:01:42.759> things<00:01:42.789> at<00:01:43.119> once

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:43.330 
one so you can't do two things at once

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:45.420 
one so you can't do two things at once
so<00:01:43.569> for<00:01:44.020> me<00:01:44.110> for<00:01:44.140> example<00:01:44.320> my<00:01:44.829> phone<00:01:45.100> dies<00:01:45.399> a

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:45.430 
so for me for example my phone dies a

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:47.490 
so for me for example my phone dies a
lot<00:01:45.850> so<00:01:46.090> I'll<00:01:46.210> put<00:01:46.360> my<00:01:46.390> phone<00:01:46.780> in<00:01:46.840> one<00:01:47.229> and

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500 
lot so I'll put my phone in one and

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:51.389 
lot so I'll put my phone in one and
interestingly<00:01:48.189> enough<00:01:48.520> my<00:01:49.360> Sony<00:01:49.860> rx100<00:01:50.860> Mark

00:01:51.389 --> 00:01:51.399 
interestingly enough my Sony rx100 Mark

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:54.749 
interestingly enough my Sony rx100 Mark
three<00:01:51.820> is<00:01:52.090> essentially<00:01:52.990> just<00:01:53.200> a<00:01:53.380> USB<00:01:54.070> charger

00:01:54.749 --> 00:01:54.759 
three is essentially just a USB charger

00:01:54.759 --> 00:01:57.599 
three is essentially just a USB charger
I<00:01:54.909> you<00:01:55.479> have<00:01:55.600> to<00:01:55.719> buy<00:01:55.869> the<00:01:55.930> the<00:01:56.890> wall<00:01:57.189> charger

00:01:57.599 --> 00:01:57.609 
I you have to buy the the wall charger

00:01:57.609 --> 00:01:58.889 
I you have to buy the the wall charger
separately<00:01:58.060> and<00:01:58.149> I'm<00:01:58.240> not<00:01:58.420> going<00:01:58.570> to<00:01:58.630> do<00:01:58.780> that

00:01:58.889 --> 00:01:58.899 
separately and I'm not going to do that

00:01:58.899 --> 00:02:00.719 
separately and I'm not going to do that
and<00:01:58.990> spend<00:01:59.200> extra<00:01:59.409> money<00:01:59.500> so<00:02:00.159> what<00:02:00.250> I<00:02:00.340> do<00:02:00.399> is<00:02:00.640> I

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:00.729 
and spend extra money so what I do is I

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:02.700 
and spend extra money so what I do is I
hook<00:02:00.939> this<00:02:01.119> up<00:02:01.180> and<00:02:01.570> I've<00:02:01.990> plugged<00:02:02.320> this<00:02:02.469> in

hook this up and I've plugged this in

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:04.529 
hook this up and I've plugged this in

at the same time kind of like you're

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.310 
at the same time kind of like you're
tethered<00:02:16.030> in<00:02:16.269> a<00:02:16.359> way<00:02:16.510> juice<00:02:16.810> it<00:02:16.989> seemed<00:02:17.230> to

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.320 
tethered in a way juice it seemed to

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:18.479 
tethered in a way juice it seemed to
come<00:02:17.440> out<00:02:17.530> of<00:02:17.620> the<00:02:17.680> box<00:02:17.829> I'll<00:02:18.100> show<00:02:18.250> you<00:02:18.340> some

close-ups<00:02:18.940> have<00:02:19.030> you<00:02:19.180> seen<00:02:19.390> right<00:02:19.570> here

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:19.600 
close-ups have you seen right here

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.599 
close-ups have you seen right here
there's<00:02:20.200> essentially<00:02:20.530> four<00:02:20.859> LED<00:02:21.400> lights

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:21.609 
there's essentially four LED lights

00:02:21.609 --> 00:02:23.520 
there's essentially four LED lights
obviously<00:02:22.090> when<00:02:22.239> all<00:02:22.359> four<00:02:22.630> lit<00:02:22.930> up<00:02:23.049> that

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
obviously when all four lit up that

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.440 
obviously when all four lit up that
means<00:02:23.709> it's<00:02:23.859> fully<00:02:24.070> charged<00:02:24.640> and<00:02:24.820> typically

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
means it's fully charged and typically

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.720 
means it's fully charged and typically
in<00:02:25.600> regards<00:02:25.870> to<00:02:25.930> fully<00:02:26.200> charged<00:02:26.560> I've<00:02:26.950> tested

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:27.730 
in regards to fully charged I've tested

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:28.319 
in regards to fully charged I've tested
it<00:02:27.760> myself

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:28.329 
it myself

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:30.660 
it myself

your<00:02:34.480> phone<00:02:34.720> I've<00:02:35.200> actually<00:02:35.440> had<00:02:35.739> it<00:02:35.769> go<00:02:36.010> maybe

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
your phone I've actually had it go maybe

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.309 
your phone I've actually had it go maybe
like<00:02:36.640> four<00:02:36.970> so<00:02:37.329> it's<00:02:37.690> right<00:02:37.959> around<00:02:38.049> that<00:02:38.290> area

00:02:38.309 --> 00:02:38.319 
like four so it's right around that area

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:39.960 
like four so it's right around that area
if<00:02:38.680> not<00:02:38.890> a<00:02:38.920> little<00:02:39.069> better<00:02:39.400> than<00:02:39.670> what<00:02:39.790> they

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
if not a little better than what they

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.330 
if not a little better than what they
have<00:02:40.150> factory<00:02:40.600> tested<00:02:41.079> so<00:02:41.680> that's<00:02:41.859> great<00:02:42.160> and

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:42.340 
have factory tested so that's great and

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:44.699 
have factory tested so that's great and
it<00:02:42.459> but<00:02:42.819> it<00:02:42.850> is<00:02:43.209> actually<00:02:43.510> pretty<00:02:44.049> fast<00:02:44.440> and

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709 
it but it is actually pretty fast and

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:46.890 
it but it is actually pretty fast and
also<00:02:45.220> putting<00:02:45.430> your<00:02:45.640> your<00:02:46.090> plane<00:02:46.450> especially

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:46.900 
also putting your your plane especially

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:49.199 
also putting your your plane especially
when<00:02:47.019> iPhone<00:02:47.350> six<00:02:47.709> in<00:02:47.889> airplane<00:02:48.340> mode<00:02:48.370> made<00:02:49.060> it

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209 
when iPhone six in airplane mode made it

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:51.689 
when iPhone six in airplane mode made it
really<00:02:49.449> essentially<00:02:50.169> faster<00:02:50.590> as<00:02:50.709> well<00:02:50.859> so<00:02:51.400> it

00:02:51.689 --> 00:02:51.699 
really essentially faster as well so it

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:53.670 
really essentially faster as well so it
does<00:02:51.880> a<00:02:52.060> great<00:02:52.329> job<00:02:52.900> and<00:02:53.139> I<00:02:53.350> was

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
does a great job and I was

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.619 
does a great job and I was
I've<00:02:53.739> already<00:02:53.950> blown<00:02:54.099> away<00:02:54.400> with<00:02:54.939> that<00:02:55.209> speed

00:02:55.619 --> 00:02:55.629 
I've already blown away with that speed

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:57.959 
I've already blown away with that speed
with<00:02:55.840> its<00:02:56.019> ease<00:02:56.230> of<00:02:56.260> use<00:02:56.409> and<00:02:56.859> one<00:02:57.730> thing<00:02:57.939> that

00:02:57.959 --> 00:02:57.969 
with its ease of use and one thing that

00:02:57.969 --> 00:02:59.880 
with its ease of use and one thing that
used<00:02:58.390> to<00:02:58.510> is<00:02:58.659> when<00:02:58.870> it<00:02:58.959> gets<00:02:59.049> down<00:02:59.290> to<00:02:59.319> one

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890 
used to is when it gets down to one

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:02.250 
used to is when it gets down to one
because<00:03:00.459> I<00:03:00.579> charge<00:03:00.939> this<00:03:01.090> up<00:03:01.299> fully<00:03:01.480> and<00:03:01.780> let

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:02.260 
because I charge this up fully and let

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.349 
because I charge this up fully and let
this<00:03:02.379> go<00:03:02.560> down<00:03:02.769> when<00:03:03.489> it<00:03:03.609> gets<00:03:03.640> to<00:03:03.879> one<00:03:04.150> that

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:04.359 
this go down when it gets to one that

00:03:04.359 --> 00:03:06.479 
this go down when it gets to one that
means<00:03:04.420> it's<00:03:04.689> about<00:03:04.859> 25%<00:03:05.859> and<00:03:05.950> starts<00:03:06.219> blinking

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:06.489 
means it's about 25% and starts blinking

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:08.580 
means it's about 25% and starts blinking
and<00:03:06.849> everything<00:03:07.120> like<00:03:07.269> that<00:03:07.329> so<00:03:08.170> you<00:03:08.260> can<00:03:08.290> kind

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:08.590 
and everything like that so you can kind

I mean it's been really cool it just

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:20.039 
I mean it's been really cool it just
snowed<00:04:19.090> the<00:04:19.120> other<00:04:19.359> day<00:04:19.510> when<00:04:19.630> I<00:04:19.690> film<00:04:19.900> this
