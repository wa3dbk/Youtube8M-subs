that I they take it that I had to take
it<00:02:23.360> apart<00:02:23.420> so<00:02:23.960> I<00:02:23.990> can<00:02:24.290> show<00:02:24.500> you<00:02:24.560> how<00:02:25.070> this

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:25.430 
it apart so I can show you how this

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.740 
it apart so I can show you how this
works<00:02:26.800> it<00:02:27.800> actually<00:02:27.980> can<00:02:28.550> move<00:02:28.760> even<00:02:29.570> like

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
works it actually can move even like

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:36.580 
works it actually can move even like
that<00:02:31.690> and<00:02:32.690> you<00:02:32.870> see<00:02:32.900> inside<00:02:34.450> how<00:02:35.450> the<00:02:36.020> parts

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:36.590 
that and you see inside how the parts

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.450 
that and you see inside how the parts
are<00:02:36.770> moving<00:02:37.070> it's<00:02:37.580> basically<00:02:38.150> a<00:02:38.270> electric

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:39.460 
are moving it's basically a electric

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:45.490 
are moving it's basically a electric
motor<00:02:41.260> that<00:02:42.260> powers<00:02:43.070> some<00:02:43.790> so<00:02:44.360> my<00:02:44.600> wheels<00:02:44.990> here

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
motor that powers some so my wheels here

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:50.640 
motor that powers some so my wheels here
and<00:02:45.940> they<00:02:46.940> go<00:02:47.420> with<00:02:47.810> different<00:02:48.470> bars<00:02:49.190> up<00:02:50.090> and

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
and they go with different bars up and

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:55.210 
and they go with different bars up and
down<00:02:51.650> we<00:02:52.010> have<00:02:52.220> two<00:02:52.640> axes<00:02:53.330> up<00:02:53.630> and<00:02:54.050> down<00:02:54.350> with

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:55.220 
down we have two axes up and down with

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:57.940 
down we have two axes up and down with
like<00:02:55.970> with<00:02:56.210> a<00:02:56.240> real<00:02:56.660> Swiss<00:02:57.020> Army<00:02:57.440> knife<00:02:57.620> the

00:02:57.940 --> 00:02:57.950 
like with a real Swiss Army knife the

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:03.220 
like with a real Swiss Army knife the
ports<00:02:58.459> or<00:02:58.670> a<00:02:58.810> or<00:02:59.860> hinge<00:03:00.860> -<00:03:01.370> as<00:03:01.790> access<00:03:02.660> points

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.230 
ports or a or hinge - as access points

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:10.830 
ports or a or hinge - as access points
and<00:03:03.380> so<00:03:03.650> the<00:03:03.890> whole<00:03:04.100> thing<00:03:04.750> works<00:03:08.440> so<00:03:09.440> it's

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
and so the whole thing works so it's

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.860 
and so the whole thing works so it's
showing<00:03:11.840> how<00:03:12.110> that<00:03:12.790> moves<00:03:13.790> I<00:03:14.120> just<00:03:14.390> have<00:03:14.600> to

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:14.870 
showing how that moves I just have to

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:18.310 
showing how that moves I just have to
try<00:03:15.350> to<00:03:15.410> keep<00:03:15.890> my<00:03:16.190> fingers<00:03:16.820> out<00:03:17.120> of<00:03:17.510> the<00:03:17.570> moving

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:18.320 
try to keep my fingers out of the moving

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:22.810 
try to keep my fingers out of the moving
parts<00:03:18.950> we<00:03:19.520> see<00:03:19.700> the<00:03:19.910> electric<00:03:20.420> parts<00:03:21.400> this<00:03:22.400> one

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:22.820 
parts we see the electric parts this one

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:25.540 
parts we see the electric parts this one
goes<00:03:23.209> on<00:03:23.480> here<00:03:23.900> and<00:03:24.080> they<00:03:24.860> of<00:03:24.980> course<00:03:25.010> the

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:25.550 
goes on here and they of course the

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:29.620 
goes on here and they of course the
scales<00:03:26.050> the<00:03:27.050> scales<00:03:27.380> you<00:03:27.590> can<00:03:27.800> take<00:03:28.390> you<00:03:29.390> can

00:03:29.620 --> 00:03:29.630 
scales the scales you can take you can

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:35.920 
scales the scales you can take you can
take<00:03:29.660> off<00:03:31.300> with<00:03:32.300> this<00:03:32.510> part<00:03:33.140> velcro<00:03:34.870> so<00:03:35.870> you

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:35.930 
take off with this part velcro so you

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:43.630 
take off with this part velcro so you
see<00:03:36.519> how<00:03:37.519> it<00:03:37.730> looks<00:03:37.970> as<00:03:38.390> it<00:03:38.690> is<00:03:38.840> open

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:43.640 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:45.530 

how<00:03:44.640> it<00:03:44.910> moves

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:45.540 
how it moves

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.949 
how it moves
of<00:03:45.870> course<00:03:46.440> it's<00:03:46.739> designed<00:03:47.280> only<00:03:47.550> for<00:03:47.959> stand

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:48.959 
of course it's designed only for stand

00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:51.380 
of course it's designed only for stand
like<00:03:49.230> this<00:03:49.500> and<00:03:49.830> the<00:03:49.950> operate<00:03:50.340> position<00:03:51.150> and

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:51.390 
like this and the operate position and

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:56.660 
like this and the operate position and
they<00:03:52.099> move<00:03:53.099> like<00:03:53.370> that<00:03:55.130> so<00:03:56.130> it's<00:03:56.310> pretty<00:03:56.550> good

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 
they move like that so it's pretty good

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:01.550 
they move like that so it's pretty good

the sound that the electro motor makes

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:14.030 
the sound that the electro motor makes
is<00:04:10.650> really<00:04:10.680> dim<00:04:11.580> you<00:04:12.450> don't<00:04:12.840> hear<00:04:13.050> much<00:04:13.349> how
