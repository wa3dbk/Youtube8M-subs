cable fly's that sort of say okay it's a

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.299 
cable fly's that sort of say okay it's a
problem<00:00:31.230> area<00:00:31.349> for<00:00:31.500> most<00:00:31.800> guys<00:00:31.980> they<00:00:32.040> can

favorite exercises you may have seen

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.500 
favorite exercises you may have seen
this<00:00:41.129> in<00:00:41.190> the<00:00:41.340> in<00:00:41.519> previous<00:00:41.940> videos<00:00:42.239> that<00:00:42.269> I

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
this in the in previous videos that I

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.170 
this in the in previous videos that I
use<00:00:42.710> low-to-high<00:00:43.710> single<00:00:44.340> on<00:00:44.460> cable<00:00:44.820> fly<00:00:45.000> now

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
use low-to-high single on cable fly now

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.780 
use low-to-high single on cable fly now
this<00:00:45.629> is<00:00:45.780> mainly<00:00:46.019> for<00:00:46.199> oh<00:00:46.800> by<00:00:47.220> region<00:00:47.550> of<00:00:47.640> your

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:47.790 
this is mainly for oh by region of your

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:49.670 
this is mainly for oh by region of your
chest<00:00:48.000> which<00:00:48.210> is<00:00:48.239> a<00:00:48.360> big<00:00:48.540> area<00:00:48.780> for<00:00:48.960> for<00:00:49.559> most

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
chest which is a big area for for most

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.889 
chest which is a big area for for most
guys<00:00:49.980> can't<00:00:50.250> develop<00:00:50.790> that<00:00:50.879> area<00:00:51.059> the<00:00:51.719> reason

00:00:51.889 --> 00:00:51.899 
guys can't develop that area the reason

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:54.799 
guys can't develop that area the reason
I<00:00:52.350> do<00:00:52.530> that<00:00:52.649> single-handed<00:00:53.640> is<00:00:54.239> because<00:00:54.629> it

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
I do that single-handed is because it

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:56.090 
I do that single-handed is because it
allows<00:00:54.899> you<00:00:55.170> to<00:00:55.260> get<00:00:55.410> all<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.680> way<00:00:55.860> across

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
allows you to get all the way across

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.650 
allows you to get all the way across
which<00:00:56.520> will<00:00:56.700> fire<00:00:56.910> a<00:00:56.940> lot<00:00:57.120> more<00:00:57.300> muscle<00:00:57.480> fibers

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
which will fire a lot more muscle fibers

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:59.720 
which will fire a lot more muscle fibers
here's<00:00:58.350> the<00:00:58.469> video<00:00:58.590> in<00:00:58.829> question<00:00:58.980> in<00:00:59.430> case<00:00:59.610> you

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
here's the video in question in case you

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:09.740 
here's the video in question in case you
haven't<00:00:59.910> seen

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.210 

so<00:01:10.750> you<00:01:10.840> know<00:01:10.960> it's<00:01:11.080> when<00:01:11.230> you<00:01:11.350> see<00:01:11.470> most<00:01:11.680> guys

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:12.220 
so you know it's when you see most guys

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:13.500 
so you know it's when you see most guys
doing<00:01:12.640> this<00:01:12.700> exercise<00:01:13.120> they<00:01:13.300> would<00:01:13.420> have

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:13.510 
doing this exercise they would have

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:15.450 
doing this exercise they would have
double<00:01:13.720> handed<00:01:14.020> and<00:01:14.200> me<00:01:14.950> in<00:01:15.100> the<00:01:15.190> middle

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:15.460 
double handed and me in the middle

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.580 
double handed and me in the middle
that's<00:01:15.790> great<00:01:16.150> but<00:01:16.870> if<00:01:16.960> you<00:01:17.050> really<00:01:17.080> want<00:01:17.530> to

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:17.590 
that's great but if you really want to

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:19.290 
that's great but if you really want to
hit<00:01:17.740> that<00:01:17.950> in<00:01:18.130> a<00:01:18.160> pod<00:01:18.460> you<00:01:18.880> want<00:01:19.030> to<00:01:19.090> bring<00:01:19.210> it

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:19.300 
hit that in a pod you want to bring it

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:21.480 
hit that in a pod you want to bring it
all<00:01:19.450> the<00:01:19.600> way<00:01:19.720> across<00:01:19.810> so<00:01:20.620> he<00:01:21.070> has<00:01:21.190> a<00:01:21.220> video

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:21.490 
all the way across so he has a video

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:22.830 
all the way across so he has a video
that<00:01:21.670> I<00:01:21.730> shot<00:01:21.910> today<00:01:22.090> which<00:01:22.330> just<00:01:22.570> shows<00:01:22.630> you

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:22.840 
that I shot today which just shows you

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:34.770 
that I shot today which just shows you
how<00:01:22.870> to<00:01:23.020> do<00:01:23.230> that<00:01:23.410> with<00:01:23.860> a<00:01:23.890> regular<00:01:24.160> flies

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:34.780 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.510 

okay<00:01:35.780> guys<00:01:35.900> so<00:01:35.960> you<00:01:36.229> know<00:01:36.350> on<00:01:36.619> this<00:01:36.920> one<00:01:37.159> I'm

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
okay guys so you know on this one I'm

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:38.920 
okay guys so you know on this one I'm
holding<00:01:37.729> on<00:01:37.940> to<00:01:38.030> one<00:01:38.180> side<00:01:38.420> and<00:01:38.630> I'm<00:01:38.720> bringing

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:38.930 
holding on to one side and I'm bringing

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.260 
holding on to one side and I'm bringing
it<00:01:39.140> all<00:01:39.260> the<00:01:39.350> way<00:01:39.740> across<00:01:39.860> but<00:01:40.369> then<00:01:40.580> alternate

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
it all the way across but then alternate

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.180 
it all the way across but then alternate
you<00:01:41.960> don't<00:01:42.110> have<00:01:42.260> to<00:01:42.409> automate<00:01:42.770> it's<00:01:42.920> up<00:01:43.040> to

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:43.190 
you don't have to automate it's up to

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:44.530 
you don't have to automate it's up to
you<00:01:43.310> you<00:01:43.340> could<00:01:43.550> do<00:01:43.670> your<00:01:43.790> whole<00:01:44.000> set<00:01:44.270> and<00:01:44.450> then

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:44.540 
you you could do your whole set and then

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:46.570 
you you could do your whole set and then
switch<00:01:44.840> but<00:01:45.409> by<00:01:45.530> doing<00:01:45.860> that<00:01:46.010> it<00:01:46.250> allows<00:01:46.280> you

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:46.580 
switch but by doing that it allows you

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.430 
switch but by doing that it allows you
to<00:01:46.700> get<00:01:46.820> all<00:01:46.909> the<00:01:47.119> way<00:01:47.330> across<00:01:47.540> try<00:01:48.200> and<00:01:48.290> aim

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:48.440 
to get all the way across try and aim

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:49.870 
to get all the way across try and aim
for<00:01:48.470> the<00:01:48.650> opposing<00:01:48.950> shoulder<00:01:49.490> or<00:01:49.670> a<00:01:49.700> little

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
for the opposing shoulder or a little

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.609 
for the opposing shoulder or a little
bit<00:01:49.970> further<00:01:50.240> if<00:01:50.450> you<00:01:50.479> can<00:01:50.570> by<00:01:51.200> doing<00:01:51.500> that

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:51.619 
bit further if you can by doing that

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:53.560 
bit further if you can by doing that
you're<00:01:52.190> firing<00:01:52.490> up<00:01:52.670> so<00:01:52.880> many<00:01:53.000> more<00:01:53.270> muscle

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:53.570 
you're firing up so many more muscle

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:55.990 
you're firing up so many more muscle
fibers<00:01:53.600> than<00:01:54.259> just<00:01:54.649> come<00:01:55.250> in<00:01:55.369> here<00:01:55.670> and

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
fibers than just come in here and

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.690 
fibers than just come in here and
