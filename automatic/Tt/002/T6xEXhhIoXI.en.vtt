00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
the second disassembly because

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.920 
the second disassembly because
apparently<00:01:08.670> I<00:01:08.760> did<00:01:08.970> not<00:01:09.119> get<00:01:09.330> enough<00:01:09.600> to<00:01:09.720> coke

with<00:01:12.570> battery<00:01:12.900> so<00:01:13.830> it<00:01:14.220> makes<00:01:14.520> it<00:01:14.670> very

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:14.760 
with battery so it makes it very

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.420 
with battery so it makes it very

difficult and with my last disassembly I

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.630 
difficult and with my last disassembly I
did<00:01:17.640> not<00:01:17.759> properly<00:01:18.030> seek<00:01:18.479> my<00:01:18.659> power<00:01:18.930> port<00:01:19.770> so

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640 
did not properly seek my power port so

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.240 
did not properly seek my power port so
it'll<00:01:21.570> periodically<00:01:22.229> lose<00:01:22.530> power<00:01:22.830> when<00:01:23.100> it's

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
it'll periodically lose power when it's

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.609 
it'll periodically lose power when it's
plugged<00:01:23.490> in<00:01:23.759> and<00:01:23.880> I'm<00:01:23.970> trying<00:01:24.299> to<00:01:24.330> utilize<00:01:24.509> it

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:27.619 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:33.460

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
call it it is on top of the memory panel

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:43.609 
call it it is on top of the memory panel
that<00:01:40.560> will<00:01:40.680> also<00:01:41.070> need<00:01:41.220> to<00:01:41.280> come<00:01:41.460> off<00:01:42.290> so<00:01:43.290> I

00:01:43.609 --> 00:01:43.619 
that will also need to come off so I

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:46.399 
that will also need to come off so I
will<00:01:43.860> disassemble<00:01:44.250> all<00:01:44.520> the<00:01:44.640> screws<00:01:45.259> and<00:01:46.259> take

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
will disassemble all the screws and take

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:51.160 
will disassemble all the screws and take
it<00:01:46.530> to<00:01:46.619> the<00:01:46.710> next<00:01:46.829> stage

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.859 

now<00:01:51.740> something<00:01:52.580> to<00:01:52.670> keep<00:01:52.820> in<00:01:52.970> mind<00:01:53.030> here<00:01:53.540> with

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:53.869 
now something to keep in mind here with

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:55.780 
now something to keep in mind here with
the<00:01:53.960> stylistics<00:01:54.439> is<00:01:54.950> that<00:01:55.310> there<00:01:55.610> are<00:01:55.640> a

backlit while the other version is not
daytime<00:02:23.569> reflective<00:02:24.319> so<00:02:25.100> you<00:02:25.489> have<00:02:25.640> to

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:27.920 
get the hard drive out you use something

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.300 
get the hard drive out you use something
like<00:03:28.040> a<00:03:28.160> knife<00:03:29.799> and<00:03:30.799> you<00:03:30.950> will<00:03:31.100> need<00:03:31.280> to

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:31.310 
like a knife and you will need to

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:36.720 
like a knife and you will need to
carefully<00:03:31.670> pry<00:03:32.239> up<00:03:32.269> the<00:03:33.459> stub

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
and after that take a small standard and

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:54.630 
and after that take a small standard and
gently<00:03:48.640> from<00:03:49.599> underneath<00:03:49.930> it<00:03:50.700> lift<00:03:51.700> it<00:03:51.879> up<00:03:53.640> you

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:54.640 
gently from underneath it lift it up you

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:58.710 
gently from underneath it lift it up you
can<00:03:54.790> then<00:03:54.819> go<00:03:55.060> ahead<00:03:55.680> and<00:03:56.680> take<00:03:56.890> it<00:03:56.920> out<00:03:57.390> if<00:03:58.390> you
