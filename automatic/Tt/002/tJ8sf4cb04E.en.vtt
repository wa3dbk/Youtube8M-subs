00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:32.090
 this place here many erosions 

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:32.090
 he's very cute 

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:40.680
 the league overcoming and intensity I imagine 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.059
 What do you guys go through digging? 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.830
 trying to choose the best way to 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.629
 get the car out 

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:47.250
 must be thought of as the one that people 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:49.379
 continues to be the one that does not continue you 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.360
 will arrive in the end it passes 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.019
 I do not even think about giving up. 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.489
 no way 

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:55.680
 the first question what I am 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.570
 doing here does not require a vacation 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.600
 January, no 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.879
 It really is expensive and it's a proof I think 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.979
 Everyone's fascination with dakar is 

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:07.440
 precisely the concept of extreme 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.899
 difficulty in all aspects has no 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:13.350
 It's not easy, the days are long. 

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:15.780
 to leave very early, to sleep very little 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:19.110
 regions are extremely difficult to 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:21.690
 terms of ambient floor temperature and 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:24.240
 is the car suffers a lot the staff in general 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:26.340
 suffers many people so I think 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.380
 this is the main concept of the rally 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.340
 dakar so it's the biggest in the world 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:31.340
 the most difficult in the world 

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.770
 leave a little more ahead for who 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.810
 interdicted as we are here 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.700
 This is good will have less traffic going 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:43.280
 have fewer cars than have 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.200
 less dust - confusion - everything then 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.939
 how much further on 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:51.820
 the chance you got the clean track 

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:51.820
 to accelerate is much bigger and better 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:59.430
 a special view in the middle of a 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:01.800
 It 's nice to arrive in the place of 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.630
 cicinho also lives in Argentina and is 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:06.600
 motoring issue 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.970
 Argentina is a very distant example. 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.640
 other countries or appear with the 

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:13.400
 brazil in south america the whole city 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:16.980
 It has a race track in all the beautiful 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:19.770
 with fantastic trails and landscapes 

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.810
 As you mentioned, it's beautiful as 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:24.570
 this here then that's why people 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:27.060
 sees so many people there on the highways in 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:30.930
 specials an audience without a doubt 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:33.120
 is the world's most fanatical rally 

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:36.240
 It's amazing how many people 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:38.790
 children 

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:41.130
 whole young men and women at last 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.260
 has everything along the entire rally 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:44.430
 since we've been clogged there 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.870
 people on the roads 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.970
 Once again, congratulations to the Argentines. 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:54.530
 for passion for motorsport 

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:56.690
 What is driving? 

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:58.250
 floor in the limit the whole time 

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:01.520
 How do you work this care? 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:03.410
 car that wants to take care agile fast but 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:05.750
 caring only has to stay 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:08.300
 walking you can see 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:10.130
 you can not risk anything on a curve if you 

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:12.560
 take a little risk suddenly has a 

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:14.750
 stone always stays there so you go 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:17.360
 walking fast is taking enough 

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:18.920
 Carefully braking well on some rocks. 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.440
 stones that you can see if you go 

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:24.590
 brakes and even then the tire is giving 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:27.140
 several times and hit a stone or a 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:29.690
 little, but one hopes to see that the 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:33.130
 car a bit of behavior but I 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:33.130
 I continued to accelerate that improved 

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:38.540
 who comes here has to be prepared 

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:40.310
 You have a time that makes you want to go back to 

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:42.980
 house, no doubt you can not deny 

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:45.290
 what time you talk good is what 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:48.080
 more can happen to make it difficult to 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:50.330
 our participation in the rally but I think 

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:51.950
 the great cheap is to go through this 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:53.780
 then look back talk to that 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:56.750
 hour at leisure was to throw in the towel but 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:58.870
 we did not play so much on the serve and follow the 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:58.870
 life
