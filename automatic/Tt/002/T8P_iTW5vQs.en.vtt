pretty cool it's got the same looks as

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:48.080 
pretty cool it's got the same looks as
this<00:02:47.010> snake<00:02:47.310> does<00:02:47.519> if<00:02:47.700> you<00:02:47.790> look<00:02:47.909> at<00:02:48.000> the

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
this snake does if you look at the

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:49.970 
this snake does if you look at the
bottom<00:02:48.329> of<00:02:48.420> it<00:02:48.540> you<00:02:48.690> got<00:02:48.840> the<00:02:48.989> lights<00:02:49.440> and<00:02:49.709> and

the dark sandy colors with the snake

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:54.440 
the dark sandy colors with the snake
texture<00:02:52.370> that<00:02:53.370> is<00:02:53.430> basically<00:02:53.970> what<00:02:54.060> it<00:02:54.209> looks

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:54.450 
texture that is basically what it looks

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:56.660 
texture that is basically what it looks
like<00:02:54.629> on<00:02:54.780> the<00:02:54.840> gun<00:02:55.109> it's<00:02:55.920> like<00:02:56.159> a<00:02:56.190> snakeskin

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
like on the gun it's like a snakeskin

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.479 
like on the gun it's like a snakeskin
pattern<00:02:56.970> all<00:02:57.239> the<00:02:57.269> way<00:02:57.420> down<00:02:57.690> so<00:02:58.620> yeah<00:02:59.250> that's

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
pattern all the way down so yeah that's

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:01.399 
pattern all the way down so yeah that's
that<00:02:59.579> one<00:02:59.819> and<00:03:00.000> the<00:03:00.510> next<00:03:00.659> one<00:03:00.870> I<00:03:01.170> actually

00:03:01.399 --> 00:03:01.409 
that one and the next one I actually

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:04.390 
that one and the next one I actually
think<00:03:01.769> is<00:03:02.040> pretty<00:03:02.400> cool<00:03:02.459> its<00:03:02.790> carbon<00:03:03.090> fiber

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
think is pretty cool its carbon fiber

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.309 
think is pretty cool its carbon fiber
this<00:03:05.400> actually<00:03:05.609> hasn't<00:03:05.940> been<00:03:06.329> introduced<00:03:07.139> in

00:03:07.309 --> 00:03:07.319 
this actually hasn't been introduced in

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:09.349 
this actually hasn't been introduced in
any<00:03:07.500> cod<00:03:07.799> yet<00:03:07.829> so<00:03:08.310> I'm<00:03:08.459> really<00:03:08.700> excited<00:03:08.819> to<00:03:09.180> see

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:09.359 
any cod yet so I'm really excited to see

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:11.869 
any cod yet so I'm really excited to see
what<00:03:09.510> this<00:03:09.629> one<00:03:09.840> looks<00:03:09.870> like<00:03:10.319> I<00:03:11.069> saw<00:03:11.549> a<00:03:11.579> video

00:03:11.869 --> 00:03:11.879 
what this one looks like I saw a video

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:15.410 
what this one looks like I saw a video
from<00:03:12.599> tmartn<00:03:13.260> about<00:03:13.530> carbon<00:03:14.069> fiber<00:03:14.310> and<00:03:14.670> he's

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
from tmartn about carbon fiber and he's

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.720 
from tmartn about carbon fiber and he's
actually<00:03:15.599> got<00:03:15.900> on<00:03:15.989> the<00:03:16.109> crossbow<00:03:16.590> if<00:03:17.459> you<00:03:17.609> go

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
actually got on the crossbow if you go

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.129 
actually got on the crossbow if you go
check<00:03:17.970> out<00:03:18.060> his<00:03:18.180> channel<00:03:18.239> i<00:03:18.599> think<00:03:18.840> it's<00:03:18.989> to

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:19.139 
check out his channel i think it's to

00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:21.650 
check out his channel i think it's to
mine<00:03:19.319> but<00:03:20.099> um<00:03:20.340> yeah<00:03:20.790> he's<00:03:20.940> got<00:03:21.060> carbon<00:03:21.299> fiber

gold launcher I believe I think I look
pretty<00:03:31.049> sick<00:03:31.829> but<00:03:32.549> um<00:03:32.760> yeah<00:03:33.629> so<00:03:33.870> carbon<00:03:34.349> fibers

00:03:34.789 --> 00:03:34.799 
pretty sick but um yeah so carbon fibers

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:38.629 
pretty sick but um yeah so carbon fibers
new<00:03:35.040> and<00:03:36.169> going<00:03:37.169> on<00:03:37.230> to<00:03:37.379> the<00:03:37.470> next<00:03:37.680> camo<00:03:37.980> we

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:38.639

new and going on to the next camo we
have<00:03:38.849> cherry<00:03:39.269> blossom<00:03:39.810> now<00:03:40.680> I<00:03:40.709> think<00:03:41.010> this<00:03:41.340> one

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
look at the in-game screenshots and if

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:47.059 
look at the in-game screenshots and if
you<00:03:46.019> look<00:03:46.169> on<00:03:46.290> the<00:03:46.410> videos<00:03:46.680> I<00:03:46.769> can<00:03:46.919> actually

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:47.069 
you look on the videos I can actually

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:51.170 
you look on the videos I can actually
find<00:03:47.489> it<00:03:47.730> here<00:03:48.000> but<00:03:49.639> yeah<00:03:50.639> it's<00:03:50.819> basically

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:51.180 
find it here but yeah it's basically

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:52.939 
find it here but yeah it's basically
that<00:03:51.419> tree<00:03:51.750> its<00:03:51.989> got<00:03:52.139> like<00:03:52.199> a<00:03:52.349> branch<00:03:52.620> on<00:03:52.829> the

00:03:52.939 --> 00:03:52.949 
that tree its got like a branch on the

00:03:52.949 --> 00:03:55.069 
that tree its got like a branch on the
back<00:03:53.129> of<00:03:53.160> it<00:03:53.430> and<00:03:53.639> all<00:03:54.449> those<00:03:54.629> little<00:03:54.959> white

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:55.079 
back of it and all those little white

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:59.509 
back of it and all those little white
flowers<00:03:55.410> there<00:03:55.859> are<00:03:56.209> basically<00:03:58.190> like<00:03:59.190> pink

00:03:59.509 --> 00:03:59.519 
flowers there are basically like pink

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:01.520 
flowers there are basically like pink
they're<00:03:59.790> pink<00:04:00.090> with<00:04:00.389> the<00:04:00.870> branch<00:04:01.109> coming<00:04:01.379> out

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
they're pink with the branch coming out

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.170 
they're pink with the branch coming out
of<00:04:01.560> it<00:04:01.769> so<00:04:01.949> it's<00:04:02.069> like<00:04:02.220> a<00:04:02.250> pink<00:04:02.549> splatter<00:04:02.909> and

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
of it so it's like a pink splatter and

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.080 
of it so it's like a pink splatter and
paint<00:04:03.500> with<00:04:04.500> like<00:04:04.650> a<00:04:04.680> black<00:04:05.400> lines<00:04:05.669> will<00:04:05.909> throw

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
paint with like a black lines will throw

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:07.159 
paint with like a black lines will throw
it<00:04:06.209> looks<00:04:06.329> like<00:04:06.449> a<00:04:06.480> tree<00:04:06.780> I<00:04:06.810> think<00:04:07.049> it<00:04:07.139> looks

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:07.169 
it looks like a tree I think it looks

00:04:07.169 --> 00:04:09.890 
it looks like a tree I think it looks
pretty<00:04:07.319> cool<00:04:08.269> anyway<00:04:09.269> moving<00:04:09.419> on<00:04:09.629> to<00:04:09.780> the<00:04:09.810> next

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
pretty cool anyway moving on to the next

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.830 
pretty cool anyway moving on to the next
