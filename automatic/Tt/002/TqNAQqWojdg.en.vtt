00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:04.710
 very good in this video I'm going to 

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:06.720
 teach what are the most commands 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.999
 often used in peace affects 

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.499
 there are multiple commands that you can 

00:00:08.999 --> 00:00:13.409
 anytime access to them 

00:00:10.499 --> 00:00:15.059
 through help bar and show us 

00:00:13.409 --> 00:00:16.950
 other ways I will explain what 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.750
 are the real utilities because there 

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:20.400
 many that is to destroy objects for 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.010
 put friends in the cold list for 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.660
 ignore people etcetera and all that what 

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:27.600
 you can do from the social panel 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.720
 also invite people and so on then 

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:31.950
 you should start counting for example 

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.469
 you have a command here called age 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:35.940
 that serves to know how long ago 

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:38.339
 of your character in this case does 

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.949
 15 days they do not tell you how long you've been 

00:00:38.339 --> 00:00:42.510
 playing with him there is another command that 

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:44.760
 it serves to see the number of deaths that 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.190
 you have with him this character has died 0 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.350
 times because he is a hardcore character 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:51.479
 now let's see other commands that are 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.359
 really useful for example the command 

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:56.819
 and time level I here I have an object that 

00:00:54.359 --> 00:00:59.100
 they gave me as a reward for the races and 

00:00:56.819 --> 00:01:01.630
 is that you see in it and says the item that 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.670
 is in your course is level 100 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:05.500
 which is the maximum that a 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:06.730
 object however if I take this that 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.580
 is what I get at the beginning because I 

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:11.550
 says it's a level 1 item or if I take a 

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:14.710
 order of chaos I can say that it does not have 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:16.390
 level that does not apply to the object this 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.130
 that I use you has good because 

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:21.640
 Sometimes you play 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:24.040
 legendary objects and you do not know about 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:27.370
 what basis are they made then what can you 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:29.380
 look like this and have the 12 an object like 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:30.820
 because in this case it is an object that 

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.460
 which requires level 12 is low level 

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:35.020
 but if you are interested for example 

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.150
 these boots that are the ones that give the 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:38.680
 award and you go out and you will have 100 that 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:40.210
 means that this object can have 

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.070
 up to four holes and then by 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:43.600
 example here you can be spending 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:44.860
 jewelers until they have the four 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.420
 holes and that way then if you 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:48.220
 the object is very interesting, so clean them 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.320
 it is practically the utility that has 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:53.290
 equally well at a high level you can 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:55.680
 fall in the good case this is a used 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:59.050
 Imagine that I fall 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:01.270
 for the attack speed but I want 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:03.940
 know if you can have the maximum states 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:06.070
 then you do the level and if they have in 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:08.830
 the 75 is better than the one with the 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:11.230
 level 50 more things that you have to know 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.570
 the command has of these stamps are 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:16.450
 bothering enough is do not know this 

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:20.410
 tour and that way it blocks 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:21.880
 automatically all commands or 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.740
 rather all the guys that you 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.420
 come and now I'm going to teach you I think 

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:27.880
 which is the most useful of all the commands 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:30.940
 that you should even have a macro 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:33.220
 I have it in the macro of the 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:35.860
 keyboard because especially if you are months 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.959
 this is going to save your life to see if 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:40.540
 we found a group of enemies 

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:42.400
 this refers to the famous the 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.900
 things that are synchronization is 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.150
 vertical is when you meet with 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:49.600
 enemy friends and for example I'm 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:51.040
 hitting this possible stuck fine but 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.630
 imagine that you realize that you do not 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:55.030
 is hitting good I get a lot of level 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:58.570
 so they do not kill me because it's the command 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:00.319
 that and then it puts you to your 

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:03.049
 character in the correct position what 

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:05.900
 it is up to you to imagine here that 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:08.959
 I get between many enemies 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:11.090
 and I start to hit and does not affect me because 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:14.329
 fix the command is returned to me 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:17.120
 original position what I tell you what 

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:19.010
 I have put a macro of the g-15 of 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.530
 Logitech keyboard but good to read in 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:22.660
 any keyboard 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:25.480
 and then when I suspect that I am 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:28.870
 see if I get in some position that 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:32.290
 I'm a little bit synchronized because the 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:34.270
 I squeeze and you have seen me updated 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.910
 the position of the enemies then 

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:38.290
 because that serves and the macro is 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:40.120
 basically to not have to write it 

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:42.850
 all the time and directly tighten the 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:45.130
 key and earth synchronize good I think 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:48.190
 that he left me nothing if there would be 

00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:51.069
 debug command that this would be for says 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:53.980
 to report bus you send a screenshot 

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:55.780
 Efe 8 and you have to put in the forum the 

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:57.640
 reference the one that puts us here 

00:03:55.780 --> 00:04:00.820
 that way then to the developers 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:03.340
 A book arrives if you find it and 

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:06.400
 that way he can solve it because I think 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:07.720
 that is already this way I have another is a 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.340
 curiosity more than anything to see what they are going 

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:10.840
 the top ten of the hillside of 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:13.810
 there is no command to know 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:16.359
 in what position of the leader are you and good 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:18.459
 Well, that's all I hope you have been 

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:22.049
 of utility on everything from zinc and 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:22.049
 see you at the Texas step weight
