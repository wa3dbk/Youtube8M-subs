00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
within these games that you know it's

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.479 
within these games that you know it's
not<00:01:03.690> just<00:01:03.960> oh<00:01:04.110> we're<00:01:04.500> inside<00:01:04.830> of<00:01:04.860> the<00:01:05.040> game<00:01:05.220> and

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
not just oh we're inside of the game and

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:06.920 
not just oh we're inside of the game and
you<00:01:05.549> know<00:01:05.640> we<00:01:05.729> got<00:01:05.820> to<00:01:05.939> rescue<00:01:06.210> somebody<00:01:06.420> the

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
you know we got to rescue somebody the

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.289 
you know we got to rescue somebody the
element<00:01:07.530> of<00:01:07.680> you<00:01:07.740> can<00:01:08.159> actually<00:01:08.580> die<00:01:08.790> is<00:01:08.850> back

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:10.969 
element of you can actually die is back
and<00:01:09.510> I<00:01:09.570> think<00:01:09.630> that<00:01:09.780> was<00:01:10.049> one<00:01:10.229> of<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.409> huge

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
and I think that was one of the huge

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.310 
and I think that was one of the huge
things<00:01:11.130> I<00:01:11.580> made<00:01:11.820> sort<00:01:12.150> of<00:01:12.240> online<00:01:12.630> very

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
things I made sort of online very

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.350 
things I made sort of online very
popular<00:01:14.250> I<00:01:14.280> think<00:01:14.580> the<00:01:14.790> fact<00:01:15.000> that<00:01:15.119> you<00:01:15.270> know

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
popular I think the fact that you know

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.670 
popular I think the fact that you know
they<00:01:15.479> were<00:01:15.540> trapped<00:01:15.930> in<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.170> game<00:01:16.350> they<00:01:16.500> could

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
they were trapped in the game they could

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.890 
they were trapped in the game they could
die<00:01:16.950> that's<00:01:17.790> what<00:01:17.970> made<00:01:18.119> people<00:01:18.150> like<00:01:18.450> yo<00:01:18.689> you

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
die that's what made people like yo you

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.450 
die that's what made people like yo you
in<00:01:19.020> this<00:01:19.140> game<00:01:19.380> and<00:01:19.590> if<00:01:19.650> you<00:01:19.799> die<00:01:20.159> in<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.430> game

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
in this game and if you die in the game

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.399 
in this game and if you die in the game
you<00:01:20.759> die<00:01:20.939> in<00:01:21.000> real<00:01:21.240> life<00:01:21.299> but<00:01:21.720> and<00:01:21.900> this<00:01:22.170> one

00:01:22.399 --> 00:01:22.409 
you die in real life but and this one

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:23.870 
you die in real life but and this one
seems<00:01:22.650> a<00:01:22.770> little<00:01:22.950> bit<00:01:23.189> different<00:01:23.520> in<00:01:23.580> a<00:01:23.670> sense

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:23.880 
seems a little bit different in a sense

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.700 
seems a little bit different in a sense
for<00:01:24.030> the<00:01:24.119> fact<00:01:24.360> that<00:01:24.479> first<00:01:25.200> of<00:01:25.380> all<00:01:25.500> it's<00:01:25.619> not

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
for the fact that first of all it's not

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:26.749 
for the fact that first of all it's not
that<00:01:25.920> they're<00:01:26.040> trapped<00:01:26.280> in<00:01:26.400> the<00:01:26.490> game<00:01:26.640> or

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
that they're trapped in the game or

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.219 
that they're trapped in the game or
anything<00:01:26.880> like<00:01:27.030> that<00:01:27.090> is<00:01:27.330> some<00:01:27.479> guy<00:01:27.689> that<00:01:28.110> is

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
anything like that is some guy that is

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:29.810 
anything like that is some guy that is
pretty<00:01:28.439> much<00:01:28.560> warm<00:01:28.829> and<00:01:29.040> I'm<00:01:29.250> assuming<00:01:29.460> guy

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
pretty much warm and I'm assuming guy

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.600 
pretty much warm and I'm assuming guy
shooting<00:01:30.689> people<00:01:31.079> and<00:01:31.320> the<00:01:31.920> bullet<00:01:32.310> I<00:01:32.340> guess

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
shooting people and the bullet I guess

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.580 
shooting people and the bullet I guess
is<00:01:32.820> either<00:01:32.970> being<00:01:33.600> transferred<00:01:34.140> and<00:01:34.290> killing

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
is either being transferred and killing

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:35.960 
is either being transferred and killing
them<00:01:34.710> I'm<00:01:34.829> not<00:01:34.950> exactly<00:01:35.310> sure<00:01:35.460> our<00:01:35.700> work<00:01:35.850> so

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
them I'm not exactly sure our work so

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.340 
them I'm not exactly sure our work so
you<00:01:36.119> just<00:01:36.270> don't<00:01:36.420> might<00:01:36.689> be<00:01:36.810> more<00:01:36.990> scientific

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:37.350 
you just don't might be more scientific

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:39.590 
you just don't might be more scientific
than<00:01:37.710> anything<00:01:38.220> and<00:01:38.430> the<00:01:38.729> fact<00:01:38.880> that<00:01:39.119> it<00:01:39.299> seems

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
than anything and the fact that it seems

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:40.940 
than anything and the fact that it seems
as<00:01:39.750> though<00:01:39.869> they're<00:01:40.200> not<00:01:40.350> getting<00:01:40.560> shot<00:01:40.799> like

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
as though they're not getting shot like

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:42.319 
as though they're not getting shot like
nobody's<00:01:41.490> walking<00:01:41.670> into<00:01:41.939> the<00:01:42.090> room<00:01:42.210> and

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
nobody's walking into the room and

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:43.880 
nobody's walking into the room and
shooting<00:01:42.630> them<00:01:42.720> but<00:01:43.170> it's<00:01:43.290> not<00:01:43.320> frying<00:01:43.680> their

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:43.890 
shooting them but it's not frying their

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:45.200 
shooting them but it's not frying their
brain<00:01:44.100> either<00:01:44.310> so<00:01:44.670> there's<00:01:45.030> definitely

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
brain either so there's definitely

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.230 
brain either so there's definitely
something<00:01:45.840> very<00:01:46.070> in-depth<00:01:47.070> I<00:01:47.189> believe<00:01:47.490> to<00:01:47.850> how

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
something very in-depth I believe to how

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.969 
something very in-depth I believe to how

I<00:01:55.470> like<00:01:55.680> the<00:01:55.799> way<00:01:55.920> the<00:01:56.070> episode<00:01:56.490> started<00:01:56.790> off

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:56.969 
I like the way the episode started off

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:58.609 
I like the way the episode started off
that's<00:01:57.360> how<00:01:57.450> you<00:01:57.570> kick<00:01:57.840> things<00:01:58.110> off<00:01:58.290> and<00:01:58.500> just

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
that's how you kick things off and just

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:00.859 
that's how you kick things off and just
you<00:01:58.920> know<00:01:58.950> go<00:01:59.189> in<00:01:59.369> and<00:01:59.759> run<00:02:00.060> crazy<00:02:00.509> you<00:02:00.750> know

00:02:00.859 --> 00:02:00.869 
you know go in and run crazy you know

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.870 
you know go in and run crazy you know
this<00:02:01.049> guy<00:02:01.200> is<00:02:01.259> just<00:02:01.380> murdering<00:02:02.369> and<00:02:02.610> just

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:02.880 
this guy is just murdering and just

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:04.999 
this guy is just murdering and just
going<00:02:03.030> wild<00:02:03.329> so<00:02:03.750> I<00:02:03.930> like<00:02:04.229> the<00:02:04.380> way<00:02:04.469> the<00:02:04.590> episode

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
going wild so I like the way the episode

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.490 
going wild so I like the way the episode
started<00:02:05.549> off<00:02:05.700> with<00:02:05.880> that<00:02:06.000> very<00:02:06.390> intense<00:02:07.140> vibe

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
started off with that very intense vibe

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.169 
started off with that very intense vibe
and<00:02:07.920> once<00:02:08.190> again<00:02:08.310> it<00:02:08.520> just<00:02:08.700> brought<00:02:08.849> back<00:02:08.879> this

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
and once again it just brought back this

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.630 
and once again it just brought back this
element<00:02:09.629> of<00:02:09.660> like<00:02:09.840> yo<00:02:10.080> people<00:02:10.709> can<00:02:11.039> die<00:02:11.250> again

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
element of like yo people can die again

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:13.760 
element of like yo people can die again
so<00:02:11.879> we're<00:02:12.360> back<00:02:12.569> into<00:02:13.020> the<00:02:13.140> dangerous

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
so we're back into the dangerous

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.320 
so we're back into the dangerous
so<00:02:14.100> to<00:02:14.160> speak<00:02:14.640> and<00:02:14.760> then<00:02:14.850> we<00:02:14.910> got<00:02:15.030> a<00:02:15.060> little<00:02:15.240> bit

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
so to speak and then we got a little bit

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:16.940 
so to speak and then we got a little bit
of<00:02:15.420> context<00:02:15.870> as<00:02:16.020> to<00:02:16.050> what's<00:02:16.350> been<00:02:16.560> going<00:02:16.800> on

I<00:02:47.040> like<00:02:47.460> that<00:02:47.640> element<00:02:47.880> I<00:02:48.060> think<00:02:48.210> that's<00:02:48.360> a

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
I like that element I think that's a

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.000 
I like that element I think that's a
good<00:02:48.570> element<00:02:48.960> that<00:02:49.050> they<00:02:49.200> have<00:02:49.380> even<00:02:49.860> though

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.010 
good element that they have even though

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:52.130 
good element that they have even though
definitely<00:02:50.400> a<00:02:50.700> big<00:02:51.180> portion<00:02:51.480> of<00:02:51.630> this<00:02:51.750> episode

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.090 
art and animation for the most part for

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:10.940 
art and animation for the most part for
the<00:03:09.150> entire<00:03:09.450> episode<00:03:09.600> looked<00:03:10.320> really<00:03:10.740> good

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
the entire episode looked really good

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:12.880 
the entire episode looked really good
but<00:03:11.640> for<00:03:11.820> some<00:03:12.000> reason<00:03:12.300> the<00:03:12.390> art<00:03:12.570> looked

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 
but for some reason the art looked

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:15.440 
but for some reason the art looked
extravagant<00:03:13.890> ten<00:03:14.190> out<00:03:14.340> of<00:03:14.370> ten<00:03:14.670> when<00:03:15.180> it<00:03:15.330> was

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450 
extravagant ten out of ten when it was

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.030 
extravagant ten out of ten when it was

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:35.420 
added again I'm glad though that she
wasn't<00:03:33.930> in<00:03:34.170> this<00:03:34.290> one<00:03:34.530> and<00:03:34.740> hopefully<00:03:35.220> she's

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:35.430 
wasn't in this one and hopefully she's

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:37.670 
wasn't in this one and hopefully she's
not<00:03:35.580> gonna<00:03:35.730> be<00:03:35.880> in<00:03:36.000> any<00:03:36.120> of<00:03:36.300> it<00:03:36.450> because<00:03:36.680> sugu

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
not gonna be in any of it because sugu

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.680 
not gonna be in any of it because sugu
for<00:03:38.370> me<00:03:38.490> she<00:03:38.730> was<00:03:38.850> one<00:03:39.000> of<00:03:39.090> the<00:03:39.180> elements<00:03:39.600> I

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:39.690 
for me she was one of the elements I

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:42.020 
for me she was one of the elements I
feel<00:03:39.930> that<00:03:40.440> definitely<00:03:40.860> brought<00:03:41.190> down<00:03:41.520> the

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030 
feel that definitely brought down the

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:43.520 
feel that definitely brought down the
second<00:03:42.420> half<00:03:42.600> of<00:03:42.690> sword<00:03:42.960> art<00:03:43.080> online<00:03:43.140> I<00:03:43.350> think

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
second half of sword art online I think

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:44.840 
second half of sword art online I think
a<00:03:43.740> lot<00:03:43.860> of<00:03:43.890> people<00:03:44.160> can<00:03:44.280> agree<00:03:44.490> with<00:03:44.640> that<00:03:44.700> as

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
a lot of people can agree with that as

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:47.360 
a lot of people can agree with that as
well<00:03:45.030> so<00:03:45.240> not<00:03:45.750> having<00:03:46.080> her<00:03:46.350> in<00:03:46.530> this<00:03:46.710> one<00:03:46.950> so

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:47.370 
well so not having her in this one so

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.100 
well so not having her in this one so
far<00:03:47.670> as<00:03:47.820> we're<00:03:48.420> in<00:03:48.540> the<00:03:48.660> clear

00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:49.110 
far as we're in the clear

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:50.180 
far as we're in the clear
though<00:03:49.230> she's<00:03:49.440> still<00:03:49.620> trying<00:03:49.800> to<00:03:49.890> get<00:03:49.980> into

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190

was<00:03:59.340> a<00:03:59.370> legit<00:03:59.760> flashback<00:04:00.270> it's<00:04:00.480> been<00:04:00.600> a<00:04:00.630> while

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
was a legit flashback it's been a while

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:02.360 
was a legit flashback it's been a while
since<00:04:00.960> I<00:04:01.080> seen<00:04:01.260> the<00:04:01.380> original<00:04:01.560> starter<00:04:02.040> online

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
since I seen the original starter online

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.580 
since I seen the original starter online
but<00:04:03.060> I<00:04:03.330> definitely<00:04:03.690> don't<00:04:04.020> trust<00:04:04.290> him<00:04:04.500> because

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
but I definitely don't trust him because

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:06.770 
but I definitely don't trust him because
he<00:04:04.890> knew<00:04:05.040> a<00:04:05.070> lot<00:04:05.430> and<00:04:05.700> the<00:04:06.330> fact<00:04:06.480> that<00:04:06.600> he's

made<00:04:15.900> me<00:04:16.020> start<00:04:16.230> thinking<00:04:16.290> when<00:04:16.620> he<00:04:16.650> said<00:04:16.859> it's

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.130 
made me start thinking when he said it's

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:18.680 
made me start thinking when he said it's
almost<00:04:17.250> as<00:04:17.459> if<00:04:17.549> they're<00:04:17.730> trying<00:04:17.760> to<00:04:18.000> remind<00:04:18.390> me

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
almost as if they're trying to remind me

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:20.840 
almost as if they're trying to remind me
to<00:04:19.080> not<00:04:19.230> forget<00:04:19.680> of<00:04:19.830> what<00:04:20.010> happened<00:04:20.430> so<00:04:20.609> it

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:20.850 
to not forget of what happened so it

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:22.490 
to not forget of what happened so it
could<00:04:21.209> be<00:04:21.239> that<00:04:21.540> guy<00:04:21.750> maybe<00:04:22.140> he<00:04:22.320> could<00:04:22.470> be

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 
could be that guy maybe he could be

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:23.900 
could be that guy maybe he could be
something<00:04:22.860> you<00:04:22.890> don't<00:04:23.100> have<00:04:23.220> some<00:04:23.460> sort<00:04:23.850> of

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:23.910 
something you don't have some sort of

00:04:23.910 --> 00:04:25.190 
something you don't have some sort of
role<00:04:24.150> in<00:04:24.330> all<00:04:24.479> this<00:04:24.630> and<00:04:24.810> maybe<00:04:24.930> he's<00:04:25.050> trying

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.200 
role in all this and maybe he's trying

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:26.780 
role in all this and maybe he's trying
to<00:04:25.350> really<00:04:25.740> get<00:04:25.890> Keith<00:04:26.100> though<00:04:26.280> back<00:04:26.490> into<00:04:26.760> a
