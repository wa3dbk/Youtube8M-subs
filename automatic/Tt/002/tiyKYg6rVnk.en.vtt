and just kind of improvised it make it
up<00:01:29.370> as<00:01:29.490> we<00:01:29.610> go<00:01:29.640> yeah<00:01:30.330> well<00:01:30.480> there's<00:01:30.660> a<00:01:30.720> bunch<00:01:30.840> of

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
up as we go yeah well there's a bunch of

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:32.240 
up as we go yeah well there's a bunch of
things<00:01:31.110> you<00:01:31.200> can<00:01:31.350> try<00:01:31.470> do<00:01:31.590> to<00:01:31.860> control<00:01:32.100> the

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
things you can try do to control the

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:33.650 
things you can try do to control the
echoes<00:01:32.550> and<00:01:32.580> that<00:01:32.850> really<00:01:33.090> depends<00:01:33.450> on<00:01:33.510> how

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:33.660 
echoes and that really depends on how

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.560 
echoes and that really depends on how
much<00:01:33.780> time<00:01:34.050> we<00:01:34.380> end<00:01:34.590> up<00:01:34.650> having<00:01:34.770> a<00:01:35.010> craft<00:01:35.280> a<00:01:36.240> lot

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
much time we end up having a craft a lot

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.090 
much time we end up having a craft a lot
of<00:01:36.660> times<00:01:36.810> you<00:01:36.900> can<00:01:37.020> try<00:01:37.170> like<00:01:37.380> like<00:01:37.650> it<00:01:37.830> sound

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
of times you can try like like it sound

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:39.920 
of times you can try like like it sound
put<00:01:38.340> up<00:01:38.490> some<00:01:38.760> flags<00:01:39.000> on<00:01:39.180> c-stands

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:39.930 
put up some flags on c-stands

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.570 
put up some flags on c-stands
but<00:01:40.380> we<00:01:40.470> have<00:01:40.590> a<00:01:40.620> lot<00:01:40.800> of<00:01:40.830> furniture<00:01:41.250> in<00:01:41.460> here

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:41.580 
but we have a lot of furniture in here

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:42.860 
but we have a lot of furniture in here
there's<00:01:41.820> going<00:01:41.910> to<00:01:41.970> be<00:01:42.060> a<00:01:42.120> lot<00:01:42.330> of<00:01:42.450> objects

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:42.870 
there's going to be a lot of objects

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:44.990 
there's going to be a lot of objects
that<00:01:43.350> take<00:01:43.800> part<00:01:43.980> in<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.220> actual<00:01:44.460> fight<00:01:44.730> so

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
that take part in the actual fight so

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.460 
that take part in the actual fight so
hopefully<00:01:45.300> that<00:01:45.450> will<00:01:45.540> help<00:01:45.660> absorb<00:01:45.840> a<00:01:46.170> lot<00:01:46.350> of

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
hopefully that will help absorb a lot of

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.950 
hopefully that will help absorb a lot of
the<00:01:46.650> real<00:01:47.370> nasty<00:01:47.610> reverberations<00:01:48.390> and<00:01:48.540> then

the real nasty reverberations and then

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.420 
the real nasty reverberations and then
of<00:01:49.050> course<00:01:49.230> you<00:01:49.320> can<00:01:49.410> always<00:01:49.650> fix<00:01:49.860> it<00:01:50.040> and<00:01:50.130> post
