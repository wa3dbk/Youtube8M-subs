about 10 years ago but since then it has

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.010 
about 10 years ago but since then it has
worked<00:01:32.009> hard<00:01:32.280> often<00:01:33.150> against<00:01:33.540> the<00:01:33.630> perceived

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
unsuccessful but they would be the first

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.289 
unsuccessful but they would be the first
to<00:01:40.770> admit<00:01:40.829> that<00:01:41.100> there<00:01:41.369> is<00:01:41.400> still<00:01:41.700> much<00:01:41.909> to<00:01:42.150> do

to admit that there is still much to do
I'm<00:01:42.570> afraid<00:01:43.530> your<00:01:43.890> miners<00:01:44.250> program<00:01:44.700> gave<00:01:44.909> them

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119 
I'm afraid your miners program gave them

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:46.730 
I'm afraid your miners program gave them
no<00:01:45.299> credit<00:01:45.720> for<00:01:45.750> the<00:01:45.960> effort<00:01:46.290> they<00:01:46.409> have<00:01:46.530> made

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
no credit for the effort they have made

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.980 
no credit for the effort they have made
and<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.130> considerable<00:01:47.729> sums<00:01:48.000> of<00:01:48.180> money<00:01:48.210> which
