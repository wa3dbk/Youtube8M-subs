00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
 and hi to all of you today 

00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:07.410
 we find ourselves unpacking and testing 

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:10.010
 an apple adapter like in saved a 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.010
 micro usb 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:34.300
 and U.S 

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:44.360
 this is how I dedicate you before 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:46.400
 jingle so well we'll unpack this 

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.770
 small adapter so he goes for example 

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:51.260
 serve you when you do not have 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:52.580
 lightning cable on hand or any 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.320
 simply if you have only one case 

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:56.210
 of lightning is that you do not want 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.370
 not buy one or something like 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.110
 that or if you have several iphone per 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.320
 example 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:05.449
 so here is a micro usb cable 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:07.310
 very simple and so it's an adapter 

00:01:05.449 --> 00:01:09.649
 official from apple he was me 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:12.830
 provided by must feed point fr so 

00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:17.000
 the link will be will have no description the 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:18.640
 available at the price of 29 euros 90 on 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.680
 their shop 

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:24.440
 so this is an official cable to see 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:26.180
 besides that it's a there we do not 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.399
 recognizes the logo is not a 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:29.450
 counterfeit it's really an official 

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:31.340
 is not good 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.170
 the price anyway for an adapter 

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:34.729
 so it comes from apple but hey 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.789
 you can find some on their shop 

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:39.649
 also in the same genre here is where 

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:42.200
 you fall subjects art just removed 

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:45.560
 little thing to the little ones 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:48.229
 mister opera beforehand so here it is 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:51.860
 so just take it off finally and me 

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:55.130
 I think pop here so it's really 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:59.739
 so small so do not lose so if 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:02:04.009
 what is it like if you walk around with 

00:01:59.739 --> 00:02:04.569
 so really small at the buoy not 

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:08.270
 big thing 

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:10.970
 it's really very very small so we 

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:14.150
 going to go high school for example on so 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:18.110
 I'm trying to focus on the 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:22.400
 cable so then that's it 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:23.450
 and so there you have your usb cable from 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.790
 less micro usb 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.950
 so it must be microusb here a 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.739
 the green sava of the cnil this so there 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:34.340
 we see that it snaps the very well 

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:35.810
 so it goes very well at the level of 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.530
 the adapter my page was going to take 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:38.530
 the Iphone 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:45.510
 especially that with a bone 7 it can have 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:47.310
 a benefit because now to you 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:49.710
 and set recognizes and uncertified cables 

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:52.140
 apple and bah it could be annoying 

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:53.670
 if you want to synchronize it so this 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.170
 that I propose to you is that I am going to 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:57.750
 connect to a computer with 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:02.940
 the adapter and I find you just 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:07.670
 after that I plugged the iphone os via 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:10.710
 the adapter that's so right here 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:13.710
 so the iphone it is connected fall imac 

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:16.170
 it's just here via itunes so 

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:19.290
 the adapter here is going to slice 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:21.690
 behind in usb and I did not have the 

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:25.950
 error message finally no mistakes 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:27.750
 but warning of 2007 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.790
 because if you have a bone 7 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:32.550
 and a grandfather who had recovered and karin 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:34.890
 have certified apple and via this adapter 

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:37.620
 and well you certify your usb cable 

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:39.600
 as with the apple adapter 

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:43.170
 so but could well 

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:47.280
 synchronize your iphone under soyaux 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:47.880
 know all where they are with this with 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.459
 adapter 

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:51.810
 so I'll take you right after I 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:54.810
 shows you what it does with a cable 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:56.700
 uncertified here I plugged in 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:58.770
 the iphone so with a cable not 

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:59.790
 certified apple we see because it's all 

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:01.950
 simply black 

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:04.140
 apple does not produce it is plugged 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:05.670
 on sector and not to the computer this 

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:08.040
 time here so it will be the same result if 

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:10.800
 you plug on the computer and we can see 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:12.900
 the error message following this cable or 

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:14.480
 accessory is not certified can not 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:16.980
 not come to work with this iphone 

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:19.530

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:23.610

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:33.480
