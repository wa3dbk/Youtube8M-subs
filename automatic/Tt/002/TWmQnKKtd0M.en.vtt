slack because you need to stretch those

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.330 
slack because you need to stretch those
out<00:00:41.969> later<00:00:42.379> take<00:00:43.379> your<00:00:43.500> motherboard<00:00:43.770> and<00:00:44.070> make

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
out later take your motherboard and make

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.049 
out later take your motherboard and make
sure<00:00:44.460> it's<00:00:44.579> on<00:00:44.610> that<00:00:44.760> plastic<00:00:45.210> frame<00:00:46.850> and<00:00:47.850> go

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059 
sure it's on that plastic frame and go

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:50.720 
sure it's on that plastic frame and go
ahead<00:00:48.180> and<00:00:48.329> push<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:48.690> USB<00:00:49.289> and<00:00:49.730> battery

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
ahead and push the USB and battery

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:53.569 
ahead and push the USB and battery
connectors<00:00:51.530> through<00:00:52.530> that<00:00:52.770> little<00:00:53.100> hole<00:00:53.219> we

00:00:53.569 --> 00:00:53.579 
connectors through that little hole we

00:00:53.579 --> 00:01:00.750 
connectors through that little hole we
cut<00:00:53.850> in<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.059> last<00:00:54.270> video<00:00:54.629> at<00:00:55.620> a<00:00:55.680> 1/2<00:00:55.920> inch

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:00.760 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.580 

and<00:01:01.210> then<00:01:01.329> once<00:01:01.570> you've<00:01:01.780> got<00:01:01.809> them<00:01:02.290> through

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:02.590 
and then once you've got them through

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:04.890 
and then once you've got them through
there<00:01:03.010> usually<00:01:03.760> I<00:01:03.820> do<00:01:03.940> the<00:01:04.089> bigger<00:01:04.449> one<00:01:04.720> the

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:04.900 
there usually I do the bigger one the

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.510 
there usually I do the bigger one the
USB<00:01:05.320> first<00:01:05.650> once<00:01:06.010> you've<00:01:06.130> got<00:01:06.220> them<00:01:06.280> through

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:06.520 
USB first once you've got them through

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.060 
USB first once you've got them through
there<00:01:06.729> there's<00:01:06.940> a<00:01:07.000> have<00:01:07.900> a<00:01:07.990> half<00:01:08.200> circle<00:01:08.500> piece

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:09.070 
there there's a have a half circle piece

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:13.800 
there there's a have a half circle piece
of<00:01:09.250> plastic<00:01:10.380> you'll<00:01:11.380> put<00:01:11.890> that<00:01:12.510> you<00:01:13.510> can<00:01:13.659> lock

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:13.810 
of plastic you'll put that you can lock

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:26.450 
of plastic you'll put that you can lock
it<00:01:13.990> into<00:01:14.110> place<00:01:14.350> there<00:01:14.920> on<00:01:15.820> the<00:01:16.030> body

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.359 

it's<00:01:27.460> now<00:01:27.610> locked<00:01:27.820> in<00:01:28.000> place<00:01:28.920> okay<00:01:29.920> and<00:01:30.280> then

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:30.369 
it's now locked in place okay and then

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:34.230 
it's now locked in place okay and then
you<00:01:30.430> need<00:01:30.579> to<00:01:30.729> take<00:01:31.240> your<00:01:32.430> plastic<00:01:33.430> frame<00:01:33.729> here

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:34.240 
you need to take your plastic frame here

you need to take your plastic frame here
and<00:01:34.420> put<00:01:35.259> on<00:01:35.380> those<00:01:36.960> let's<00:01:37.960> call<00:01:38.140> them<00:01:38.259> screw

00:01:38.639 --> 00:01:38.649 
and put on those let's call them screw

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:42.359 
and put on those let's call them screw
columns<00:01:40.350> so<00:01:41.350> it's<00:01:41.560> in<00:01:41.740> place<00:01:42.009> and<00:01:42.280> you<00:01:42.340> can

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:42.369 
columns so it's in place and you can

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:44.069 
columns so it's in place and you can
screw<00:01:42.789> it<00:01:42.939> in<00:01:43.060> properly<00:01:43.539> make<00:01:43.720> sure<00:01:43.869> you've

screw it in properly make sure you've
got<00:01:44.110> plenty<00:01:44.439> of<00:01:44.590> slack<00:01:44.890> again<00:01:45.520> on<00:01:45.670> those

00:01:45.779 --> 00:01:45.789 
got plenty of slack again on those

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:50.300 
got plenty of slack again on those
ribbons<00:01:46.149> and<00:01:47.020> those<00:01:47.860> connect<00:01:48.189> your<00:01:48.310> cords

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
ribbons and those connect your cords

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.160 
ribbons and those connect your cords
first<00:01:51.310> do<00:01:51.490> the<00:01:51.640> bigger<00:01:52.090> black<00:01:52.390> one<00:01:52.689> put<00:01:53.020> that

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:53.170 
first do the bigger black one put that

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.490 
first do the bigger black one put that
into<00:01:53.350> the<00:01:53.909> bottom<00:01:54.909> larger<00:01:55.630> white<00:01:55.899> connector

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:56.500 
into the bottom larger white connector

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.449 
into the bottom larger white connector
plug<00:01:58.530> it's<00:01:59.530> just<00:01:59.649> easier<00:02:00.009> to<00:02:00.039> just<00:02:00.280> use<00:02:00.429> your

00:02:00.449 --> 00:02:00.459 
plug it's just easier to just use your

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:02.309 
plug it's just easier to just use your
fingers<00:02:00.939> just<00:02:01.179> kind<00:02:01.390> of<00:02:01.659> shove<00:02:01.899> it<00:02:02.049> in<00:02:02.140> there

00:02:02.309 --> 00:02:02.319 
fingers just kind of shove it in there

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:04.499 
fingers just kind of shove it in there
if<00:02:03.250> you've<00:02:03.369> got<00:02:03.549> to<00:02:03.670> touch<00:02:03.819> the<00:02:03.880> motherboard

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:22.070 
little eight Forks at the right there

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:25.670 
little eight Forks at the right there
put<00:03:23.070> them<00:03:23.160> there<00:03:23.340> into<00:03:23.490> that<00:03:23.640> plug<00:03:24.560> slide<00:03:25.560> it

put them there into that plug slide it

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:32.690 
put them there into that plug slide it
in<00:03:25.800> there<00:03:25.920> should<00:03:26.220> go<00:03:26.340> in<00:03:26.520> pretty<00:03:27.270> easily<00:03:31.700> and

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
in there should go in pretty easily and

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:33.980 
in there should go in pretty easily and
then<00:03:32.910> the<00:03:33.030> easiest<00:03:33.300> way<00:03:33.480> is<00:03:33.630> to<00:03:33.660> put<00:03:33.870> this

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:33.990 
then the easiest way is to put this

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:36.470 
then the easiest way is to put this
screw<00:03:34.290> directly<00:03:34.470> on<00:03:34.800> the<00:03:34.980> magnetic<00:03:35.640> tip<00:03:35.820> and

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
screw directly on the magnetic tip and

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:41.570 
screw directly on the magnetic tip and
then<00:03:36.630> go<00:03:37.020> in<00:03:37.170> from<00:03:37.350> there<00:03:39.860> to<00:03:40.860> sharp<00:03:41.310> yeah

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:41.580 
then go in from there to sharp yeah

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:42.530 
then go in from there to sharp yeah
you'll<00:03:41.790> want<00:03:41.940> to<00:03:41.970> put<00:03:42.120> that<00:03:42.239> in<00:03:42.360> there

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
you'll want to put that in there

this little yellow ribbon here it's

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:24.430 
this little yellow ribbon here it's
actually<00:04:23.240> really<00:04:23.330> easy<00:04:23.600> I<00:04:23.720> kind<00:04:23.960> of<00:04:24.020> fumble<00:04:24.320> it

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:24.440 
actually really easy I kind of fumble it

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:28.480 
actually really easy I kind of fumble it
but<00:04:25.310> that<00:04:26.300> was<00:04:26.419> pretty<00:04:26.660> easy<00:04:26.810> just<00:04:27.340> push<00:04:28.340> it

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:28.490 
but that was pretty easy just push it

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:31.440 
but that was pretty easy just push it
down<00:04:28.520> right<00:04:29.030> upside<00:04:29.720> down<00:04:29.990> onto<00:04:30.590> the

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:31.450 
down right upside down onto the

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:39.610 
down right upside down onto the
connector<00:04:35.530> it'll<00:04:36.530> snap<00:04:36.740> as<00:04:36.950> well<00:04:37.930> and<00:04:38.930> if<00:04:39.500> you

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:39.620 
connector it'll snap as well and if you

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:41.530 
connector it'll snap as well and if you
maybe<00:04:40.010> you<00:04:40.730> need<00:04:40.880> some<00:04:41.030> glue<00:04:41.240> or<00:04:41.270> some

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:41.540 
maybe you need some glue or some

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:44.500 
maybe you need some glue or some
double-sided<00:04:41.900> tape<00:04:42.940> that<00:04:43.940> helps<00:04:44.240> to<00:04:44.330> keep

00:04:46.659 --> 00:04:46.669 
that on there should be okay though if

00:04:46.669 --> 00:04:48.250 
that on there should be okay though if
you<00:04:46.760> just<00:04:46.880> took<00:04:47.000> it<00:04:47.120> apart<00:04:47.360> and<00:04:47.600> the<00:04:48.020> same

kind of in the way there's a pain and

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:09.219 
kind of in the way there's a pain and
the<00:05:07.490> holes<00:05:07.669> not<00:05:07.790> really<00:05:08.030> big<00:05:08.180> enough<00:05:08.360> but<00:05:08.600> push

00:05:09.219 --> 00:05:09.229 
the holes not really big enough but push

00:05:09.229 --> 00:05:11.800 
the holes not really big enough but push
up<00:05:09.530> on<00:05:09.830> your<00:05:10.310> motor<00:05:10.520> firmly<00:05:10.970> but<00:05:11.210> gently<00:05:11.270> and

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:11.810 
up on your motor firmly but gently and

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:14.440 
up on your motor firmly but gently and
the<00:05:12.020> pinion<00:05:12.470> gear<00:05:12.680> should<00:05:13.130> pop<00:05:13.400> through<00:05:14.330> the

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:14.450 
the pinion gear should pop through the

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:16.420 
the pinion gear should pop through the
foot<00:05:14.690> and<00:05:14.990> a<00:05:15.020> little<00:05:15.229> hole<00:05:15.410> just<00:05:15.770> there<00:05:16.280> this

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:16.430 
foot and a little hole just there this

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:23.720 
wait right pop up there is then you got

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:26.469 
wait right pop up there is then you got
to<00:05:23.810> put<00:05:23.930> in<00:05:24.050> these<00:05:24.200> connectors<00:05:25.300> again<00:05:26.300> just

00:05:26.469 --> 00:05:26.479 
to put in these connectors again just

00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:28.060 
to put in these connectors again just
use<00:05:26.600> your<00:05:26.720> fingers<00:05:27.080> they<00:05:27.350> go<00:05:27.500> in<00:05:27.620> pretty

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:28.070 
use your fingers they go in pretty

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:37.579 
use your fingers they go in pretty
easily<00:05:29.140> into<00:05:30.140> your<00:05:30.290> motor

00:05:37.579 --> 00:05:37.589 

00:05:37.589 --> 00:05:41.299 

do<00:05:38.099> this<00:05:38.219> before<00:05:38.369> screwing<00:05:38.789> it<00:05:39.029> in<00:05:40.309> nice

00:05:41.299 --> 00:05:41.309 
do this before screwing it in nice

00:05:41.309 --> 00:05:43.099 
do this before screwing it in nice
little<00:05:41.339> bit<00:05:41.609> easier<00:05:41.909> this<00:05:42.629> is<00:05:42.779> the<00:05:42.869> correct

00:05:43.099 --> 00:05:43.109 
little bit easier this is the correct

00:05:43.109 --> 00:05:44.959 
little bit easier this is the correct
order<00:05:43.379> to<00:05:43.469> do<00:05:43.589> it<00:05:43.709> in<00:05:43.829> so<00:05:44.729> put<00:05:44.879> those

00:05:44.959 --> 00:05:44.969 
order to do it in so put those

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:50.599 
order to do it in so put those
connectors<00:05:45.419> in<00:05:45.599> there<00:05:49.219> make<00:05:50.219> sure<00:05:50.249> they're<00:05:50.519> in

00:05:50.599 --> 00:05:50.609 
connectors in there make sure they're in

00:05:50.609 --> 00:05:56.659 
connectors in there make sure they're in
there<00:05:50.699> all<00:05:50.789> the<00:05:50.939> way<00:05:54.229> and<00:05:55.229> then<00:05:55.459> here<00:05:56.459> you<00:05:56.519> got

00:05:56.659 --> 00:05:56.669 
there all the way and then here you got

00:05:56.669 --> 00:06:00.979 
there all the way and then here you got
your<00:05:56.869> other<00:05:57.869> 12<00:05:58.319> sharp<00:05:58.979> end<00:05:59.189> screws<00:05:59.839> same<00:06:00.839> as

00:06:00.979 --> 00:06:00.989 
your other 12 sharp end screws same as

00:06:00.989 --> 00:06:02.779 
your other 12 sharp end screws same as
the<00:06:01.079> ones<00:06:01.259> you<00:06:01.349> put<00:06:01.529> in<00:06:01.619> the<00:06:01.739> motherboard<00:06:02.069> and

00:06:02.779 --> 00:06:02.789 
the ones you put in the motherboard and

00:06:02.789 --> 00:06:06.079 
the ones you put in the motherboard and
the<00:06:02.909> nap<00:06:03.059> board<00:06:04.249> do<00:06:05.249> a<00:06:05.279> triple<00:06:05.519> speed<00:06:05.819> again

00:06:06.079 --> 00:06:06.089 
the nap board do a triple speed again

00:06:06.089 --> 00:06:07.099 
the nap board do a triple speed again
for<00:06:06.269> times<00:06:06.509> sake

00:06:07.099 --> 00:06:07.109 
for times sake

00:06:07.109 --> 00:06:09.499 
for times sake
easiest<00:06:07.679> way<00:06:07.799> again<00:06:08.159> it's<00:06:08.309> just<00:06:08.369> two<00:06:08.699> blue

00:06:09.499 --> 00:06:09.509 
easiest way again it's just two blue

00:06:09.509 --> 00:06:11.209 
easiest way again it's just two blue
toolkits<00:06:09.959> got<00:06:10.139> pretty<00:06:10.349> strong<00:06:10.559> magnet<00:06:10.949> tips

00:06:11.209 --> 00:06:11.219 
toolkits got pretty strong magnet tips

on the tip of the magnet and then go in

00:06:25.529 --> 00:06:48.300 
on the tip of the magnet and then go in
that's<00:06:25.769> the<00:06:25.859> easiest<00:06:26.069> way<00:06:26.249> to<00:06:26.279> do<00:06:26.519> it
