00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:15.350 
in our game i think is fantastic that

00:03:15.350 --> 00:03:18.010 
in our game i think is fantastic that
kind<00:03:16.070> of<00:03:16.130> mean<00:03:16.640> green<00:03:17.000> interfacing<00:03:17.660> the<00:03:17.780> funds

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:18.020 
kind of mean green interfacing the funds

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:20.680 
kind of mean green interfacing the funds
sometimes<00:03:18.680> players<00:03:18.890> and<00:03:19.190> must<00:03:19.940> be<00:03:20.000> quite<00:03:20.540> nice

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:20.690 
sometimes players and must be quite nice

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:22.180 
sometimes players and must be quite nice
to<00:03:20.870> have<00:03:20.990> a<00:03:21.020> training<00:03:21.260> session<00:03:21.440> more<00:03:21.770> relaxed

00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:22.190 
to have a training session more relaxed

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:23.470 
to have a training session more relaxed
maybe<00:03:22.640> think<00:03:22.850> I<00:03:22.940> we're<00:03:23.120> not<00:03:23.209> going<00:03:23.330> to<00:03:23.390> get

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:23.480 
maybe think I we're not going to get

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.120 
maybe think I we're not going to get
busy<00:03:23.660> quite<00:03:23.990> as<00:03:24.170> much<00:03:24.320> by<00:03:24.530> the<00:03:24.560> coaches<00:03:24.980> to

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130

take their finger this signal we kind of

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:28.870 
take their finger this signal we kind of
making<00:03:27.740> mistakes<00:03:27.890> in<00:03:28.310> front<00:03:28.520> of<00:03:28.640> everyone

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:28.880
