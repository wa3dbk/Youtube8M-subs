helmets in the six to seven hundred
dollar<00:00:44.610> range<00:00:44.880> so<00:00:45.660> this<00:00:45.810> is<00:00:45.990> d-o-t<00:00:46.410> approved

and they're using the new TCT ultra
prepreg<00:00:49.800> shell<00:00:50.100> so<00:00:50.610> pretty<00:00:51.120> much<00:00:51.329> what<00:00:51.600> this

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:51.720 
prepreg shell so pretty much what this

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:54.170 
prepreg shell so pretty much what this
is<00:00:51.960> is<00:00:52.200> a<00:00:52.260> newer<00:00:52.739> more<00:00:53.310> precise<00:00:53.850> way<00:00:54.150> of

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
is is a newer more precise way of

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.940 
is is a newer more precise way of
manufacturing<00:00:55.050> this<00:00:55.260> helmet<00:00:55.470> to<00:00:55.739> put

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:00.810 
fiberglass aramid and organic poly resin

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:03.200 
fiberglass aramid and organic poly resin
fibers<00:01:01.470> it<00:01:01.770> creates<00:01:02.340> a<00:01:02.460> lightweight<00:01:03.000> yet

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
fibers it creates a lightweight yet

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:04.790 
fibers it creates a lightweight yet
strong<00:01:03.300> helmet<00:01:04.019> and<00:01:04.320> they're<00:01:04.650> also

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:04.800 
strong helmet and they're also

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:06.410 
strong helmet and they're also
manufacturing<00:01:05.550> it<00:01:05.729> in<00:01:05.850> three<00:01:06.270> different

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
manufacturing it in three different

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.750 
manufacturing it in three different
shell<00:01:06.840> sizes<00:01:07.140> so<00:01:07.830> throughout<00:01:08.250> the<00:01:08.460> range

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
shell sizes so throughout the range

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.940 
shell sizes so throughout the range
you're<00:01:09.300> gonna<00:01:09.420> get<00:01:09.630> a<00:01:09.690> more<00:01:09.900> precise<00:01:10.320> fit<00:01:10.740> and

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
you're gonna get a more precise fit and

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.649 
you're gonna get a more precise fit and
also<00:01:11.340> a<00:01:11.370> lighter<00:01:11.880> weight<00:01:12.150> helmet<00:01:12.510> because

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
also a lighter weight helmet because

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.240 
also a lighter weight helmet because
you're<00:01:12.990> not<00:01:13.080> gonna<00:01:13.200> have<00:01:13.290> a<00:01:13.440> bunch<00:01:13.680> of<00:01:13.800> padding

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
you're not gonna have a bunch of padding

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.940 
you're not gonna have a bunch of padding
to<00:01:14.640> fill<00:01:14.850> that<00:01:15.030> extra<00:01:15.420> space<00:01:15.659> now<00:01:16.380> this<00:01:16.770> is<00:01:16.920> a

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
to fill that extra space now this is a

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.490 
to fill that extra space now this is a
size<00:01:17.220> large<00:01:17.580> it's<00:01:17.970> roughly<00:01:18.330> about<00:01:18.479> 1600<00:01:19.350> grams

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
size large it's roughly about 1600 grams

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.920 
size large it's roughly about 1600 grams
which<00:01:20.220> is<00:01:20.250> really<00:01:21.000> competitive<00:01:21.330> to<00:01:21.750> those

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
which is really competitive to those

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.810 
which is really competitive to those
higher<00:01:22.260> priced<00:01:22.710> helmets<00:01:23.100> in<00:01:23.220> that<00:01:23.370> six<00:01:23.670> to

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:31.440 
also take a look at the great aesthetics

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:34.390 
also take a look at the great aesthetics
you<00:01:31.680> have<00:01:31.830> really<00:01:32.310> clean<00:01:32.640> smooth<00:01:33.150> lines<00:01:33.479> the

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:34.400 
you have really clean smooth lines the

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.350 
you have really clean smooth lines the

rest of the shell is very subtle and

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.890 
rest of the shell is very subtle and
it's<00:01:38.729> gonna<00:01:38.850> have<00:01:39.090> very<00:01:39.420> very<00:01:39.600> nice

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
it's gonna have very very nice
