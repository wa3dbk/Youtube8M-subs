00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
 well all guys orgasms that are here 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:06.330
 to welcome you in the sarro to 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.670
 chelsea new episode after a while 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.730
 I bring an episode to the channel that opens 

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:14.759
 with the purchase of cahill defender more 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:17.550
 strong that there is in chelsea why not 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.830
 we have very large jug the defenders 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.779
 is the one that has good speed and 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.300
 however good values ​​of physical defenses 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:26.279
 so it is our defensive pivot that 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.050
 however it consumes good couple formula 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:29.519
 absolutely had to take it because 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.289
 besides being strong and I was 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:34.260
 recommended by almost all of you 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:35.640
 keep recommending players from 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.219
 take in the next videos though 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.370
 however they are ending and soon we will go 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:42.989
 to play in the gold tournament anyway 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.480
 let's go with a new one a new game 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:47.399
 with the first game of the pisodio 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.320
 we find this player with one 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.719
 really very nice team a hybrid 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:55.969
 very strong even if only two championships 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:58.140
 more or less the game is enough 

00:00:55.969 --> 00:01:00.690
 balanced except that it has towards the 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.760
 35th I do a stupid with the 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.040
 defender with aspire queta that comes 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.740
 expelled the opponent does not score in that 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.210
 case marks at the end after they are with i 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.610
 teeth I managed to hold 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.920
 pretty much the whole game 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.420
 unfortunately mark rondon with a shot 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.799
 quite lucky because hit 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.659
 also the pole and then I eat of 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.450
 all in the final as you can see here 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:24.060
 drogba there is a ball of one of one 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.580
 that maybe it would have made me lose to 

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.740
 in any case, I lose in the extra 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.780
 regulatory times 10 or in any case there 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.790
 was why after that stupid 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.619
 perhaps he did not deserve the red pins 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.170
 queta but after some stupid I have 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.990
 really suffered so much being expelled 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:42.479
 I had to buy both spi 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:44.369
 filipe luis tongue that will be anyway 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.030
 very titillating because really strong and 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.100
 then greets us with 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:51.640
 very few games played the vast 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:53.290
 queta césar azpilicueta called dave nuova 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.740
 game the team is forming 

00:01:53.290 --> 00:02:00.280
 unfortunately drogba has played a game 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:01.869
 very ugly last year, yes 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:03.310
 can redo against this opponent who 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:05.259
 still a very good team 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:06.940
 but he doesn't have a super fast defense 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:09.489
 at least for the part of 

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:11.920
 left in fact I start immediately at the 

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:13.150
 great with an Oscar goal that guys 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.310
 proves to be a player 

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:17.650
 phenomenal look here for that action 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.820
 skipped two players and put it on 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.340
 half one with a wonderful action 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:23.470
 comes the goal of the hall that it too 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.420
 it is turning out to be really good 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:29.830
 player you will also see later 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:31.330
 oscar just to make a golasso succeeds 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.580
 a from outside the area pull this shot a 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:35.470
 turn one of his classic goals to put it 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:38.590
 all of which then manages to free even 

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:41.410
 drug for the goal of 4 to 0 so we are 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:44.530
 type two goals and two assists something 

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:47.650
 genre for what it is called for oscar 

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:49.390
 really a strong player I 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.100
 liked so much then another nice goal 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.980
 of the hall that manages to jump the goalkeeper 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:55.540
 with a twinge ends 5 to 0 game 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.040
 won quite easily though 

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.110
 however the opponent as I said 

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:02.140
 before he had a good team but I was 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:03.910
 quite superior last purchase 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:06.489
 of the day peter cech 

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:08.500
 we needed a decent porter in the sense 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:11.350
 what schwarzer last games he played 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:13.299
 pretty well not very well either 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:16.239
 very badly, however, the time has come for 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:18.130
 replace it and then take that in the 

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:20.200
 next episode I will probably take 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:24.459
 rowing to have an extra gear too 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:26.019
 offensively, however, I look for a new one 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:28.090
 adversary so I come so 

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:29.829
 network check in progress however the 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:31.570
 team as you see one is forming 

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:33.220
 good team pity that there is ivanovic 

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:34.570
 which is not very fast otherwise it would be 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.519
 very competitive 

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:38.350
 third and final opponent beak this 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:40.950
 here that does not have so much understanding or better 

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:43.269
 almost all understood not too much we say 

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:44.890
 but really good players 

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:46.930
 in any case it starts very well with 

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:48.370
 wonderful room action coming in 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:50.350
 everyone jumps in the area with feints 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:52.450
 incredible at a ball control a 

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:54.280
 crazy dribbling and manages to score 

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:56.349
 of one to zero after half an hour of 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:58.480
 balance but then immediately after 

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:59.080
 I make a stupid here not stalling 

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:01.330
 consumes 

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:03.580
 but that goes down immediately and the opponent can 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:05.110
 dribble can make its zig zag go 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:06.940
 straight on goal and make goals from one to 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:08.530
 a goal that will be the only one of this 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:10.420
 game for my opponent because then 

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:12.220
 however I was playing very well 

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:13.810
 so also here with a bit of luck or 

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:16.900
 however the same would have entered the 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:19.330
 always an oscar shot to say one 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.799
 makes the goal of 2 1 then closes asar that 

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:23.890
 however it was from some game that not 

00:04:20.799 --> 00:04:27.280
 you could see just zero either assist and 

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:28.720
 so even asar makes this goal of 3 

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:30.370
 to 1 that closes the game also because 

00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:32.950
 the opponent 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:35.350
 obviously on 3 to 1 he decides to drive 

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:37.090
 it still had 25 minutes, he had everything 

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:39.490
 time to try a comeback in each 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:41.580
 so he is my players here 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:43.650
 they all mark but drugs 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:46.000
 however raga 

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:47.830
 for now he is doing well with the team 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:51.130
 I am quite comfortable with the form 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:53.650
 yet I must change to them 

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:56.260
 I dare to change drugs while rowing then 

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:58.570
 maybe diego what to try later 

00:04:56.260 --> 00:05:00.880
 maybe not somatic instead of mikel 

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:02.980
 which seems a little stronger to me 

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:04.660
 I don't want this right now 

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:06.550
 take fabregas because I am 

00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:08.560
 quite well indeed very well with 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:09.940
 oscar and I would not replace it though 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:11.410
 maybe you could also try 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:13.840
 change form let me know in 

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:15.460
