00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:10.840
 hello everyone hello everyone and welcome 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.059
 Well, this here in the garden and it's 

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:17.080
 that impresses even I am 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:19.650
 used to seeing it impresses 

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:22.210
 the amount of life that there is in 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:26.220
 appears as soon as you take a little bit of 

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:26.220
 maybe a little grass 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.650
 let's see if now they do not leave me bad 

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:33.100
 but let's go as soon as you move a little bit 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.870
 the 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.870
 as soon as you move the grass a little 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:43.170
 appears fixed sews 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:48.809
 see how life appears there 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:01.590
 immediately nothing by moving a little 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:04.610
 of ground there that already found 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.610
 earthworms 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:09.110
 or use pnas 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:13.110
 just move a little 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:18.170
 the grass removes it and 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.170
 appear immediately 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:25.040
 here is paid a lot with organic fertilizer 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:25.040
 the earth is paid a lot 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:30.480
 they live from that practically 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:34.440
 and they are constantly entering and 

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:36.660
 coming in and out with which 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.900
 the earth is self-ventilated thanks to 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:38.900
 they 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.720
 just as they appear they disappear 

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.720
 logically 

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:51.580
 but that is an unequivocal symbol of a 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:54.850
 rich or enriched land well paid and 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:57.820
 healthy where there are worms has always been 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:00.270
 said that it is good land for 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.270
 cultivate 

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:06.370
 I was cleaning a little bit around 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.840
 of the peach tree and as soon as you clean a 

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:09.319
 bit 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:13.540
 appear 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:13.540
 it's awesome they appear kicked 

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:23.970
 as soon as you take off the grass a little 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:23.970
 they appear kicked 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:27.629
 i 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:46.130
 first thing in the morning logically 

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:49.250
 much more 

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:51.590
 it's almost noon 

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.500
 and they start costing them a little more 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.570
 leave but 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:58.210
 but come on, it's a continuous enter and 

00:02:55.570 --> 00:03:00.610
 leave with the grass na practically not 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:03.120
 birds are appreciated by birds 

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.120
 yes they see them 

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:09.040
 but if they are not always continuously 

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:10.900
 helping us 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:13.030
 to ventilate the earth it seems that no but 

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:16.019
 today and there they are working for us 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.019
 and working for free 

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:23.430
 so it's good not to fill the earth with 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:26.569
 pesticides and nurseries 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:29.450
 because if we kill all this 

00:03:26.569 --> 00:03:32.540
 and deserted all good then nothing else 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:34.990
 that I wanted to show a little one 

00:03:32.540 --> 00:03:37.980
 friend 

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:37.980
 assistant 

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:45.690
 from the orchard of the 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:45.690
 farmer who is there always 

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:52.569
 helping us 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:54.549
 to the earth being healthy and ventilated 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:57.620
 Well, nothing more than that but that 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:04:00.319
 someone serves as a curious anecdote 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:03.010
 and interesting and that today there is no need 

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:05.709
 throwing pesticides to kill them 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:09.190
 exterminate them because they are helping us 

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:09.190
 work in our game 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:14.409
 nothing more than that have until then
