00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240 
get started

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.419 
get started
first<00:00:10.139> we're<00:00:10.349> going<00:00:10.469> to<00:00:10.620> place<00:00:10.830> our<00:00:10.980> cake<00:00:11.160> into

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
first we're going to place our cake into

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.490 
first we're going to place our cake into
a<00:00:11.460> food<00:00:11.730> processor<00:00:11.759> I<00:00:12.480> have<00:00:13.080> this<00:00:13.200> really

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
a food processor I have this really

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.560 
a food processor I have this really
adorable<00:00:13.799> mini<00:00:14.070> pink<00:00:14.429> one<00:00:14.580> and<00:00:14.759> just<00:00:15.330> go<00:00:15.450> ahead

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
adorable mini pink one and just go ahead

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.519 
adorable mini pink one and just go ahead
and<00:00:15.809> chop<00:00:15.990> this<00:00:16.170> up<00:00:17.810> you<00:00:18.810> could<00:00:18.990> also<00:00:19.140> do<00:00:19.410> this

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:19.529 
and chop this up you could also do this

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.019 
and chop this up you could also do this
by<00:00:19.770> hand<00:00:20.070> but<00:00:20.310> I<00:00:20.340> think<00:00:20.609> that<00:00:20.730> the<00:00:20.850> food

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029 
by hand but I think that the food

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:25.070 
by hand but I think that the food
processor<00:00:21.539> makes<00:00:21.750> it<00:00:21.869> much<00:00:22.050> faster<00:00:23.960> once<00:00:24.960> you

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
processor makes it much faster once you

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.779 
processor makes it much faster once you
have<00:00:25.260> fine<00:00:25.500> crumbs<00:00:25.830> go<00:00:26.130> ahead<00:00:26.279> and<00:00:26.400> take<00:00:26.609> this

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789
