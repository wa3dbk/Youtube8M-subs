00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.959
 hi guys today I present the new 

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:11.959
 smart globe by oregon scientific e 

00:00:08.959 --> 00:00:14.839
 immersion discovery as you see is squat 

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:17.029
 in the sense that it is a classic globe 

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:20.300
 but also interactive thanks to these three 

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:22.250
 panels 1 on the games we have seen 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.140
 now one on educational activities there 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:26.060
 there are 19 activities with many 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.339
 I have no specific information 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:31.460
 to our country information on countries 

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:33.860
 capitals names populations coins 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:35.989
 national officials and so on if there is 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:37.579
 it is very simply so is the 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:39.920
 globe as you hear hermida 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:41.870
 literally welcome after that 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.579
 I can go and question him then a 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:46.340
 world map in every sense thanks 

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:48.710
 as I said before to the electronic pen 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.930
 it starts for example from the continents but 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:53.359
 I can go as I told you in detail 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:56.030
 on many aspects up to 

00:00:53.359 --> 00:00:58.190
 curiosity towards the moment in the bocciate is 

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.960
 world map to separate that I make a pair 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.219
 of touches with the pen is not because of her 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.960
 it's precise but because I had to 

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:04.730
 I could not see a little crooked 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.470
 otherwise to make the video in the socket 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:08.090
 live 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:14.900
 here are the details on the road to 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:17.900
 example the curiosities and so on 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:19.730
 really to the curious world above all 

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:25.940
 for the little ones who are approaching 

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:27.740
 example to geography and here we are now 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:30.080
 let's see what they are instead 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.280
 the game activities those to me 

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:33.410
 personally I liked them better 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.270
 because we can go or compare 

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:40.430
 country this case the surface 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:42.950
 of Iran chooses fold as you hear 

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.479
 or there is the game mode mode 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.550
 that I liked a lot that of 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:48.710
 challenge in which he makes me 

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:50.840
 questions I will talk a little video game 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:53.030
 just as there was in the fable 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.710
 interactive a video game with which he went 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.240
 that search for the various elements that it 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.479
 they won to look for the game to become 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.009
 this level changes more intensely 1 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:03.110
 simpler I have to go to find i 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:05.030
 various game elements for the world 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.470
 within the time then then move on 

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:10.420
 level and also the music I have to say 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:10.420
 false phase becoming the shoehorn 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:27.230
 the discovery of capital of Thailand 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:30.580
 counter ok in case we make mistakes 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:32.900
 the signal number then I can go to 

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:34.280
 resume my point to proceed then 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:37.640
 there are also all national anthems 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:39.860
 of all the countries that the world map smar 

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.030
 roma already arrives with three batteries a that lo 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:43.640
 feed included in the package 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:47.030
 so you can start playing right away 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:49.130
 for three formations you can sign here 

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.320
 below in the comments obviously I wait for you 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.820
 but I like it here on this video and for 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:56.470
 the next videos on the channel plays
