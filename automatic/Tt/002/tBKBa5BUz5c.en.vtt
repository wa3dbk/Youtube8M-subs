guys was a camp saw for backpacking that
I<00:00:06.839> have<00:00:07.230> custom<00:00:07.649> made<00:00:07.890> and<00:00:08.220> there<00:00:09.120> are<00:00:09.269> similar

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:11.330 
I have custom made and there are similar

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:14.180 
I have custom made and there are similar
devices<00:00:12.330> like<00:00:12.660> this<00:00:12.929> that<00:00:12.990> you<00:00:13.410> can<00:00:13.440> find<00:00:13.830> on

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:14.190 
devices like this that you can find on

YouTube<00:00:15.059> and<00:00:15.650> I<00:00:16.650> haven't<00:00:17.550> seen<00:00:17.730> one<00:00:17.789> exactly

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
YouTube and I haven't seen one exactly

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:20.450 
YouTube and I haven't seen one exactly
like<00:00:18.420> this<00:00:18.600> and<00:00:19.140> I<00:00:19.439> would<00:00:19.529> like<00:00:19.740> to<00:00:20.010> share<00:00:20.279> this

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
like this and I would like to share this

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.200 
like this and I would like to share this
with<00:00:20.670> you<00:00:20.789> this<00:00:20.850> is<00:00:21.150> a<00:00:21.619> sawzall<00:00:22.619> blade<00:00:22.920> saw<00:00:23.430> I

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
with you this is a sawzall blade saw I

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.830 
with you this is a sawzall blade saw I
bought<00:00:24.779> three<00:00:25.199> blades<00:00:25.560> that<00:00:25.890> came<00:00:26.099> in<00:00:26.220> a<00:00:26.310> pack

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:26.840 
bought three blades that came in a pack

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.919 
bought three blades that came in a pack
for<00:00:27.840> ten<00:00:28.080> dollars<00:00:29.269> which<00:00:30.269> these<00:00:30.480> blades<00:00:30.750> are

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929 
for ten dollars which these blades are

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.250 
for ten dollars which these blades are
really<00:00:31.260> aggressive<00:00:31.500> and<00:00:32.360> it<00:00:33.360> cut<00:00:33.600> really<00:00:33.960> well

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
really aggressive and it cut really well

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.930 
really aggressive and it cut really well
you<00:00:35.219> could<00:00:35.370> probably<00:00:35.579> cut<00:00:37.370> well<00:00:38.370> I<00:00:38.399> know<00:00:38.550> what

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
you could probably cut well I know what

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.810 
you could probably cut well I know what
it'll<00:00:39.120> cut<00:00:39.300> is<00:00:39.510> a<00:00:39.540> four<00:00:39.899> inch<00:00:40.140> log<00:00:40.550> which<00:00:41.550> you

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
it'll cut is a four inch log which you

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.760 
it'll cut is a four inch log which you
don't<00:00:42.210> necessarily<00:00:42.390> have<00:00:42.870> to<00:00:42.899> put<00:00:43.170> on<00:00:43.350> but<00:00:43.649> you

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770 
don't necessarily have to put on but you

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:46.819 
don't necessarily have to put on but you
probably<00:00:44.100> could<00:00:44.370> and<00:00:44.899> it<00:00:45.899> will<00:00:46.230> cut<00:00:46.530> really

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
probably could and it will cut really

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.790 
probably could and it will cut really
good<00:00:47.100> it's<00:00:47.370> a<00:00:47.460> very<00:00:48.120> aggressive<00:00:48.750> when<00:00:49.620> they

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
good it's a very aggressive when they

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:51.709 
good it's a very aggressive when they
are<00:00:49.950> probably<00:00:50.850> one<00:00:50.940> of<00:00:50.969> the<00:00:51.090> only<00:00:51.270> aggressive

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
are probably one of the only aggressive

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.330 
are probably one of the only aggressive
saws<00:00:52.140> like<00:00:52.289> this<00:00:52.620> that<00:00:52.800> you<00:00:52.920> could<00:00:53.100> give<00:00:53.309> for

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
saws like this that you could give for

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.290 
saws like this that you could give for
backpacking<00:00:54.090> other<00:00:54.780> than<00:00:55.170> a<00:00:55.289> solve<00:00:55.559> Iver

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:56.300 
backpacking other than a solve Iver

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.420 
backpacking other than a solve Iver
which<00:00:57.300> is<00:00:57.449> a<00:00:57.480> really<00:00:57.780> good<00:00:57.960> saw<00:00:58.199> but<00:00:59.100> you<00:00:59.280> don't

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
which is a really good saw but you don't

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:01.490 
which is a really good saw but you don't
have<00:00:59.550> to<00:00:59.670> spend<00:00:59.910> that<00:01:00.090> money<00:01:00.329> on<00:01:00.629> a<00:01:00.899> solve<00:01:01.199> Iver

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:01.500 
have to spend that money on a solve Iver

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.250 
have to spend that money on a solve Iver
obviously<00:01:02.340> because<00:01:02.640> you<00:01:03.600> can<00:01:03.780> just<00:01:03.899> do<00:01:04.110> this

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
obviously because you can just do this

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.740 
obviously because you can just do this
here<00:01:04.559> and<00:01:04.860> I'm<00:01:05.100> saying<00:01:05.369> it<00:01:05.670> probably<00:01:06.210> you<00:01:06.630> know

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
here and I'm saying it probably you know

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:09.350 
here and I'm saying it probably you know
ain't<00:01:07.229> as<00:01:07.500> as<00:01:07.950> easy<00:01:08.340> to<00:01:08.490> use<00:01:08.760> you<00:01:09.060> know<00:01:09.180> the

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
ain't as as easy to use you know the

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.320 
ain't as as easy to use you know the
handles<00:01:09.780> not<00:01:09.960> gonna<00:01:10.140> be<00:01:10.290> as<00:01:10.409> nice<00:01:11.150> right<00:01:12.150> down

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
handles not gonna be as nice right down

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:14.480 
handles not gonna be as nice right down
here<00:01:12.720> it's<00:01:12.960> not<00:01:13.140> gonna<00:01:13.350> be<00:01:13.530> quite<00:01:14.310> as

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
here it's not gonna be quite as

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.140 
here it's not gonna be quite as
ergonomic<00:01:15.330> as<00:01:15.479> that<00:01:15.659> solve<00:01:15.960> Iver<00:01:16.290> but<00:01:17.070> go<00:01:18.030> out

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150 
ergonomic as that solve Iver but go out

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.460 
ergonomic as that solve Iver but go out
in<00:01:18.270> the<00:01:18.330> woods<00:01:18.450> it's<00:01:18.930> lightweight<00:01:19.229> and<00:01:21.470> cheap

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
in the woods it's lightweight and cheap

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.580 
in the woods it's lightweight and cheap
you<00:01:22.830> know<00:01:23.220> that's<00:01:23.759> the<00:01:23.909> bottom<00:01:24.180> line<00:01:24.530> this<00:01:25.530> is

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
you know that's the bottom line this is

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.760 
you know that's the bottom line this is
what<00:01:25.740> the<00:01:26.009> bottom<00:01:26.400> end<00:01:26.580> of<00:01:26.700> it<00:01:26.880> looks<00:01:27.060> like

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:27.770 
what the bottom end of it looks like

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.249 
what the bottom end of it looks like
typically<00:01:28.770> and<00:01:29.210> you<00:01:30.210> know<00:01:30.299> you<00:01:30.450> can<00:01:30.689> just<00:01:30.900> wrap

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
typically and you know you can just wrap

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.609 
typically and you know you can just wrap
this<00:01:31.530> up<00:01:31.590> I<00:01:32.070> use<00:01:32.820> square<00:01:33.150> knots<00:01:33.390> with<00:01:34.290> a<00:01:34.320> little

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
this up I use square knots with a little

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:39.469 
this up I use square knots with a little
bit<00:01:34.740> of<00:01:34.829> glue<00:01:35.009> and<00:01:35.250> we're<00:01:36.180> just<00:01:36.360> fine<00:01:38.329> and<00:01:39.329> what

00:01:39.469 --> 00:01:39.479 
bit of glue and we're just fine and what

00:01:39.479 --> 00:01:41.210 
bit of glue and we're just fine and what
we<00:01:39.570> have<00:01:39.720> here<00:01:39.750> is<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.200> she<00:01:40.409> thought<00:01:40.650> made<00:01:40.920> I

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
we have here is the she thought made I

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.539 
we have here is the she thought made I
just<00:01:41.820> took<00:01:42.060> place<00:01:42.750> a<00:01:42.810> water<00:01:43.229> bottle<00:01:43.530> I

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
just took place a water bottle I

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:47.030 
just took place a water bottle I
it's<00:01:45.090> basically<00:01:45.509> twice<00:01:45.810> as<00:01:46.079> thickness<00:01:46.590> and<00:01:46.829> I

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
it's basically twice as thickness and I

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.940 
it's basically twice as thickness and I
just<00:01:47.250> folded<00:01:47.640> it<00:01:47.790> back<00:01:47.939> over<00:01:48.180> wrap<00:01:49.079> it<00:01:49.350> around

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
just folded it back over wrap it around

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.270 
just folded it back over wrap it around
but<00:01:50.250> Gorilla<00:01:50.970> Tape<00:01:51.350> Forge<00:01:52.350> really<00:01:52.829> well<00:01:53.009> I

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
but Gorilla Tape Forge really well I

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:57.139 
but Gorilla Tape Forge really well I
really<00:01:53.759> like<00:01:53.909> the<00:01:54.060> product<00:01:54.299> and<00:01:55.790> right<00:01:56.790> here

00:01:57.139 --> 00:01:57.149 
really like the product and right here

00:01:57.149 --> 00:01:58.280 
really like the product and right here
it's<00:01:57.479> folded<00:01:57.930> over

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
it's folded over

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.410 
it's folded over
but<00:01:58.649> I<00:01:58.680> didn't<00:01:59.070> tape<00:01:59.280> that<00:01:59.490> around<00:01:59.820> there<00:02:00.030> so

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:00.420 
but I didn't tape that around there so

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.749 
but I didn't tape that around there so
when<00:02:00.630> you<00:02:00.710> stick<00:02:01.710> this<00:02:01.860> blade<00:02:02.070> in<00:02:02.399> the<00:02:02.490> sheet

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
when you stick this blade in the sheet

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:06.469 
when you stick this blade in the sheet
like<00:02:03.000> so<00:02:04.189> it<00:02:05.189> really<00:02:05.640> holds<00:02:05.820> tightly

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
like so it really holds tightly

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.650 
like so it really holds tightly
I<00:02:06.600> mean<00:02:06.990> tight<00:02:07.500> I<00:02:07.799> mean<00:02:08.459> that<00:02:08.910> doesn't<00:02:09.330> really

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660 
I mean tight I mean that doesn't really

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.630 
I mean tight I mean that doesn't really
want<00:02:09.840> to<00:02:09.989> split<00:02:10.140> that<00:02:10.319> in<00:02:10.440> there<00:02:10.590> I<00:02:11.039> mean<00:02:11.489> it

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:28.620 
on the solve Iver which you know I would

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.340 
on the solve Iver which you know I would
like<00:02:28.710> to<00:02:28.890> have<00:02:29.070> one<00:02:29.340> but<00:02:29.790> you<00:02:30.690> know<00:02:30.780> my<00:02:31.050> price

like to have one but you know my price

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.320 
like to have one but you know my price
range<00:02:31.380> probably<00:02:32.310> a<00:02:32.490> lot<00:02:32.640> of<00:02:32.670> other<00:02:32.820> people's

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
range probably a lot of other people's

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.870 
range probably a lot of other people's
you<00:02:33.840> this<00:02:34.080> would<00:02:34.260> do<00:02:34.410> you<00:02:35.370> know<00:02:35.490> lightweight

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
you this would do you know lightweight

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.730 
you this would do you know lightweight
backpacking<00:02:36.600> I<00:02:37.080> mean<00:02:37.230> this<00:02:37.350> thing<00:02:37.560> doesn't

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:37.740 
backpacking I mean this thing doesn't

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:40.580 
backpacking I mean this thing doesn't
weigh<00:02:37.950> anything<00:02:37.980> I<00:02:38.960> don't<00:02:39.960> know<00:02:40.050> exactly<00:02:40.170> what

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:40.590 
weigh anything I don't know exactly what

to measure but I'm telling you what if

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.940 
to measure but I'm telling you what if
you<00:02:45.060> make<00:02:45.270> one<00:02:45.480> of<00:02:45.570> these<00:02:45.690> you'll<00:02:46.650> probably

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:46.950 
you make one of these you'll probably

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.600 
you make one of these you'll probably
enjoy<00:02:47.250> it<00:02:47.780> it's<00:02:48.780> a<00:02:49.050> useful<00:02:49.410> tool<00:02:49.610> when

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
enjoy it it's a useful tool when

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.790 
enjoy it it's a useful tool when
backpacking<00:02:51.360> you<00:02:52.050> don't<00:02:52.200> necessarily<00:02:52.320> need

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
backpacking you don't necessarily need

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.090 
backpacking you don't necessarily need
it<00:02:52.980> but<00:02:53.790> there's<00:02:54.270> an<00:02:54.420> option<00:02:54.570> and<00:02:55.020> that's<00:02:55.770> a

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:56.100
