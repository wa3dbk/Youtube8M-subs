now<00:00:40.340> inside<00:00:41.030> of<00:00:41.090> this<00:00:41.300> machine<00:00:41.750> the<00:00:42.320> media<00:00:42.739> is

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:42.980 
now inside of this machine the media is

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.150 
now inside of this machine the media is
a<00:00:43.430> steel<00:00:43.760> shot<00:00:44.180> ok<00:00:44.809> now<00:00:45.290> this<00:00:45.440> happens<00:00:45.830> to<00:00:45.920> be<00:00:46.130> a

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:46.160 
a steel shot ok now this happens to be a

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.299 
a steel shot ok now this happens to be a
very<00:00:46.489> fine<00:00:46.820> steel<00:00:47.239> shot<00:00:47.600> it's<00:00:48.079> a<00:00:48.230> 170<00:00:49.040> shot

00:00:49.299 --> 00:00:49.309 
very fine steel shot it's a 170 shot

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:51.430 
very fine steel shot it's a 170 shot
it's<00:00:49.640> one<00:00:49.790> of<00:00:49.880> the<00:00:49.969> finest<00:00:50.450> so<00:00:50.899> if<00:00:50.960> you<00:00:51.050> look<00:00:51.230> on

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:51.440 
it's one of the finest so if you look on

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.619 
it's one of the finest so if you look on
the<00:00:51.590> side<00:00:51.980> of<00:00:52.040> the<00:00:52.160> bag<00:00:52.340> here<00:00:52.550> it<00:00:52.610> says<00:00:52.790> steel

00:00:53.619 --> 00:00:53.629 
the side of the bag here it says steel

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:58.150 
the side of the bag here it says steel
shot<00:00:53.960> 170<00:00:55.270> this<00:00:56.270> is<00:00:56.480> not<00:00:56.629> going<00:00:56.870> to<00:00:57.020> remove<00:00:57.739> a

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:58.160 
shot 170 this is not going to remove a

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:01.479 
shot 170 this is not going to remove a
lot<00:00:58.579> of<00:00:59.260> concrete<00:01:00.260> ok<00:01:00.890> this<00:01:01.100> is<00:01:01.280> going<00:01:01.399> to

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:01.489 
lot of concrete ok this is going to

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:04.090 
lot of concrete ok this is going to
provide<00:01:01.850> just<00:01:01.910> a<00:01:02.210> very<00:01:02.450> fine<00:01:02.809> profile<00:01:03.440> if<00:01:03.680> we

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:04.100 
provide just a very fine profile if we

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.190 
provide just a very fine profile if we
needed<00:01:04.339> a<00:01:04.520> more<00:01:04.699> aggressive<00:01:05.030> profile<00:01:05.690> we

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:06.200 
needed a more aggressive profile we

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.650 
needed a more aggressive profile we
would<00:01:06.380> consider<00:01:06.830> the<00:01:07.039> use<00:01:07.250> of<00:01:07.520> a<00:01:07.670> larger<00:01:08.330> steel

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:08.660 
would consider the use of a larger steel

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:10.690 
would consider the use of a larger steel
shot<00:01:08.990> all<00:01:09.289> the<00:01:09.410> way<00:01:09.440> in<00:01:09.800> upwards<00:01:10.190> of<00:01:10.310> us<00:01:10.490> say<00:01:10.670> a

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:10.700 
shot all the way in upwards of us say a

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.840 
shot all the way in upwards of us say a
320<00:01:11.360> which<00:01:11.390> is<00:01:11.600> very<00:01:11.869> big<00:01:12.140> so<00:01:12.410> the<00:01:13.369> larger<00:01:13.820> the

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:13.850 
320 which is very big so the larger the

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.840 
320 which is very big so the larger the
steel<00:01:14.270> shot<00:01:14.660> the<00:01:15.350> more<00:01:16.070> aggressive<00:01:16.700> it's

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850 
steel shot the more aggressive it's

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:18.640 
steel shot the more aggressive it's
going<00:01:17.030> to<00:01:17.090> be<00:01:17.270> for<00:01:17.600> demonstration<00:01:18.200> purposes

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:18.650 
going to be for demonstration purposes

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.340 
going to be for demonstration purposes
we're<00:01:18.830> going<00:01:18.860> to<00:01:19.010> show<00:01:19.220> you<00:01:19.250> 170<00:01:20.060> now<00:01:20.750> this<00:01:21.200> is

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:21.350 
we're going to show you 170 now this is

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.140 
we're going to show you 170 now this is
a<00:01:21.380> little<00:01:21.680> screen<00:01:22.040> that<00:01:22.070> simply<00:01:22.670> fits<00:01:22.909> inside

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:23.150 
a little screen that simply fits inside

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.810 
a little screen that simply fits inside
of<00:01:23.390> the<00:01:23.600> machine<00:01:24.200> right<00:01:24.409> here<00:01:24.439> and<00:01:24.820> that's

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:25.820 
of the machine right here and that's

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:27.780 
of the machine right here and that's
just<00:01:25.909> a<00:01:26.150> screen<00:01:26.479> to<00:01:26.659> prevent<00:01:26.960> any<00:01:27.229> pieces<00:01:27.560> of

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:27.790 
just a screen to prevent any pieces of

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:31.149 
just a screen to prevent any pieces of
say<00:01:28.790> wood<00:01:29.360> or<00:01:29.659> paper<00:01:29.869> that<00:01:30.470> would<00:01:30.650> get

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:31.159 
say wood or paper that would get

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:33.550 
say wood or paper that would get
dislodged<00:01:32.090> inside<00:01:32.720> of<00:01:32.869> there<00:01:33.020> and<00:01:33.200> it<00:01:33.439> would

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
dislodged inside of there and it would

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:36.039 
dislodged inside of there and it would
actually<00:01:33.710> alter<00:01:34.580> the<00:01:34.729> door<00:01:34.939> from<00:01:35.330> hinging<00:01:35.840> so

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:36.049 
actually alter the door from hinging so

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:38.440 
actually alter the door from hinging so
we<00:01:36.170> just<00:01:36.350> put<00:01:36.500> that<00:01:36.530> screen<00:01:37.009> in<00:01:37.189> there<00:01:37.450> and

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:38.450 
we just put that screen in there and

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:44.140 
we just put that screen in there and
then<00:01:39.909> put<00:01:40.909> some<00:01:41.090> of<00:01:41.119> the<00:01:41.240> steel<00:01:41.479> shot<00:01:42.970> now<00:01:43.970> this

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:44.150 
then put some of the steel shot now this

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:48.880 
then put some of the steel shot now this
machine<00:01:46.210> recycles<00:01:47.210> the<00:01:47.360> shot<00:01:47.630> okay<00:01:48.110> what<00:01:48.860> I

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
machine recycles the shot okay what I

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:51.100 
machine recycles the shot okay what I
mean<00:01:49.159> by<00:01:49.340> that<00:01:49.369> is<00:01:49.820> we<00:01:50.119> have<00:01:50.270> the<00:01:50.450> vacuum

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110 
mean by that is we have the vacuum

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:58.450 
mean by that is we have the vacuum
attachment<00:01:53.320> and<00:01:54.460> what<00:01:55.460> happens<00:01:56.799> it<00:01:57.799> actually

00:01:58.450 --> 00:01:58.460 
attachment and what happens it actually

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.120 
attachment and what happens it actually
recycles<00:01:59.420> and<00:01:59.630> it<00:01:59.960> captures<00:02:00.470> the<00:02:00.500> airborne

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:01.130 
recycles and it captures the airborne

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:03.700 
recycles and it captures the airborne
dust<00:02:01.369> particulate<00:02:02.030> but<00:02:02.600> yet<00:02:02.869> it<00:02:03.049> maintains

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:03.710 
dust particulate but yet it maintains

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.460 
dust particulate but yet it maintains
the<00:02:03.890> steel<00:02:04.220> shot<00:02:04.520> inside<00:02:04.970> of<00:02:05.149> it<00:02:05.470> when

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:06.470 
the steel shot inside of it when

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:08.080 
the steel shot inside of it when
operating<00:02:06.979> equipment<00:02:07.430> like<00:02:07.549> this<00:02:07.729> it's<00:02:08.030> a

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.090 
operating equipment like this it's a

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.150 
operating equipment like this it's a
great<00:02:08.299> idea<00:02:08.479> to<00:02:08.929> have<00:02:09.229> your<00:02:09.769> safety<00:02:10.009> glasses

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:10.160 
great idea to have your safety glasses

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.400 
great idea to have your safety glasses
the<00:02:10.970> last<00:02:11.180> thing<00:02:11.390> you<00:02:11.600> need<00:02:11.630> is<00:02:11.930> the<00:02:12.140> media

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
the last thing you need is the media

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.380 
the last thing you need is the media
flying<00:02:12.829> up<00:02:12.980> into<00:02:13.190> your<00:02:13.280> eyes<00:02:13.430> so<00:02:13.760> the<00:02:14.150> way<00:02:14.269> this
