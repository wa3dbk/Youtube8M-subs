out gonna do her little video tomorrow
down<00:00:37.180> at<00:00:37.390> the<00:00:37.510> pond<00:00:37.829> we're<00:00:38.829> doing<00:00:39.100> the

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:39.220 
down at the pond we're doing the

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:41.270 
down at the pond we're doing the
retrieve<00:00:39.670> and<00:00:39.940> she's<00:00:40.120> doing<00:00:40.480> great<00:00:40.659> with<00:00:41.050> that

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:41.280 
retrieve and she's doing great with that

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:44.220 
retrieve and she's doing great with that
she<00:00:42.280> actually<00:00:42.519> will<00:00:43.300> actually<00:00:43.839> bring<00:00:44.050> it

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:44.230

though<00:00:47.110> i<00:00:47.140> don't<00:00:47.260> know<00:00:47.470> if<00:00:47.530> you<00:00:47.620> remember<00:00:47.739> with

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:48.040 
though i don't know if you remember with

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:49.410 
though i don't know if you remember with
nick<00:00:48.280> we<00:00:48.489> had<00:00:48.579> done<00:00:48.699> something<00:00:49.000> called<00:00:49.300> the

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:49.420 
nick we had done something called the

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.899 
nick we had done something called the
force<00:00:49.720> matching<00:00:50.320> where<00:00:50.530> you<00:00:50.650> make<00:00:50.860> him<00:00:51.100> you

00:00:51.899 --> 00:00:51.909 
force matching where you make him you

00:00:51.909 --> 00:00:53.549 
force matching where you make him you
know<00:00:52.030> bring<00:00:52.330> it<00:00:52.479> back<00:00:52.720> and<00:00:52.989> she<00:00:53.170> hasn't<00:00:53.470> had

00:00:53.549 --> 00:00:53.559 
know bring it back and she hasn't had

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:55.740 
know bring it back and she hasn't had
all<00:00:53.619> that<00:00:54.010> done<00:00:54.369> but<00:00:54.670> she's<00:00:55.269> really<00:00:55.449> pretty

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:55.750 
all that done but she's really pretty

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.170 
all that done but she's really pretty
good<00:00:56.110> so<00:00:56.589> if<00:00:56.979> you<00:00:57.280> were<00:00:57.400> going<00:00:57.549> on<00:00:57.850> seriously

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:58.180 
good so if you were going on seriously

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:59.789 
good so if you were going on seriously
you<00:00:58.659> probably<00:00:58.689> have<00:00:59.140> to<00:00:59.170> get<00:00:59.409> the<00:00:59.530> force

00:00:59.789 --> 00:00:59.799 
you probably have to get the force

00:00:59.799 --> 00:01:02.219 
you probably have to get the force
matching<00:01:00.309> done<00:01:00.489> on<00:01:00.729> her<00:01:00.879> but<00:01:01.689> anyway<00:01:02.049> we're

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:02.229 
matching done on her but anyway we're

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:03.420 
matching done on her but anyway we're
just<00:01:02.379> going<00:01:02.559> to<00:01:02.619> give<00:01:02.739> her<00:01:02.860> a<00:01:02.920> little<00:01:03.129> run

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:03.430 
just going to give her a little run

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:19.520 
just going to give her a little run
through<00:01:03.850> and<00:01:04.479> we'll<00:01:04.960> go<00:01:05.049> from<00:01:05.080> there<00:01:05.340> we<00:01:06.340> deal

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:19.530

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:31.090 
the force matching done we can talk

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:32.430 
the force matching done we can talk
about<00:03:31.240> that<00:03:31.360> would<00:03:31.690> probably<00:03:31.840> take<00:03:32.110> another

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:32.440 
about that would probably take another

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.010 
about that would probably take another
month<00:03:32.830> but<00:03:33.790> I<00:03:33.820> mean<00:03:34.030> she's<00:03:34.240> doing<00:03:34.420> great<00:03:34.720> as
