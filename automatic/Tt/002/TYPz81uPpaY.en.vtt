available at some point at level 90 you
will<00:06:37.420> get<00:06:37.600> a<00:06:37.630> quest<00:06:37.990> and<00:06:38.200> those<00:06:38.410> gates<00:06:38.740> will

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:39.010 
will get a quest and those gates will

00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:42.240 
will get a quest and those gates will
pop<00:06:39.250> open<00:06:39.460> for<00:06:39.880> you<00:06:40.030> so<00:06:40.270> uh<00:06:40.890> I'll<00:06:41.890> just<00:06:41.920> show

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:45.520 
you the gates I wanted to show most

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:49.530 
you the gates I wanted to show most
important<00:06:46.030> gates<00:06:46.240> for<00:06:46.420> us<00:06:46.540> right<00:06:46.750> now<00:06:46.810> so<00:06:48.540> it

00:06:49.530 --> 00:06:49.540 
important gates for us right now so it

00:06:49.540 --> 00:06:53.930 
important gates for us right now so it
wasn't<00:06:49.900> far<00:06:50.830> away<00:06:51.430> from<00:06:51.490> that<00:06:51.940> point<00:06:52.300> and<00:06:52.740> this

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:53.940 
wasn't far away from that point and this

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:58.560 
wasn't far away from that point and this
this<00:06:54.940> is<00:06:55.510> the<00:06:55.870> gate<00:06:56.520> this<00:06:57.520> is<00:06:57.580> the<00:06:57.820> gate<00:06:58.060> were

00:06:58.560 --> 00:06:58.570 
this is the gate this is the gate were

00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:02.670 
this is the gate this is the gate were
interested<00:06:59.350> in<00:06:59.530> and<00:07:00.100> as<00:07:00.700> I<00:07:00.880> said<00:07:00.940> before<00:07:01.680> they
