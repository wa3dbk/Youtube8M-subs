status<00:00:09.700> is<00:00:09.910> called<00:00:10.330> role<00:00:10.660> strain<00:00:10.990> and<00:00:11.700> rural

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:12.700 
status is called role strain and rural

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.400 
status is called role strain and rural
strain<00:00:12.999> causes<00:00:13.329> an<00:00:13.539> individual<00:00:13.959> to<00:00:14.019> be<00:00:14.110> pulled

strain causes an individual to be pulled

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:16.080 
strain causes an individual to be pulled
in<00:00:14.499> many<00:00:14.740> directions<00:00:14.889> by<00:00:15.669> the<00:00:15.730> many

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:16.090 
in many directions by the many

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:18.480 
in many directions by the many
responsibilities<00:00:16.990> of<00:00:17.140> one<00:00:17.410> single<00:00:17.710> status<00:00:18.279> so

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:18.490 
responsibilities of one single status so

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:20.790 
responsibilities of one single status so
an<00:00:18.580> example<00:00:18.640> would<00:00:19.090> be<00:00:19.119> a<00:00:19.269> student<00:00:19.590> and<00:00:20.590> let's

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:20.800 
an example would be a student and let's

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.700 
an example would be a student and let's
say<00:00:20.949> this<00:00:21.130> student<00:00:21.580> has<00:00:21.939> to<00:00:22.269> write<00:00:22.900> two<00:00:23.170> papers

one week so they are being pulled in

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:34.979 
one week so they are being pulled in
many<00:00:33.070> different<00:00:33.340> ways<00:00:33.520> by<00:00:33.820> this<00:00:34.000> one<00:00:34.390> status

00:00:34.979 --> 00:00:34.989 
many different ways by this one status

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:37.229 
many different ways by this one status
the<00:00:35.170> status<00:00:35.559> of<00:00:35.710> being<00:00:35.920> a<00:00:36.039> student<00:00:36.370> on<00:00:36.760> the

00:00:37.229 --> 00:00:37.239 
the status of being a student on the

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:38.610 
the status of being a student on the
other<00:00:37.360> hand<00:00:37.600> there's<00:00:37.809> what's<00:00:38.050> called<00:00:38.110> role

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:38.620 
other hand there's what's called role

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:40.380 
other hand there's what's called role
conflict<00:00:38.890> and<00:00:39.399> this<00:00:39.489> is<00:00:39.640> talking<00:00:40.030> about<00:00:40.090> the

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:40.390 
conflict and this is talking about the

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:42.420 
conflict and this is talking about the
conflict<00:00:40.960> between<00:00:41.140> the<00:00:41.500> roles<00:00:41.949> of<00:00:42.129> two<00:00:42.340> or

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:42.430 
conflict between the roles of two or

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:44.520 
conflict between the roles of two or
more<00:00:42.460> social<00:00:43.090> statuses<00:00:43.539> so<00:00:44.140> I<00:00:44.170> want<00:00:44.379> to<00:00:44.410> be

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:44.530 
more social statuses so I want to be

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:46.650 
more social statuses so I want to be
clear<00:00:44.890> when<00:00:45.100> I<00:00:45.129> say<00:00:45.399> between<00:00:45.820> statuses<00:00:46.539> this

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:46.660 
clear when I say between statuses this

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:48.779 
clear when I say between statuses this
is<00:00:46.809> not<00:00:46.960> an<00:00:47.109> individual<00:00:47.710> status<00:00:48.219> like<00:00:48.399> before

00:00:48.779 --> 00:00:48.789 
is not an individual status like before

00:00:48.789 --> 00:00:50.790 
is not an individual status like before
so<00:00:49.660> let's<00:00:49.870> take<00:00:50.050> a<00:00:50.079> look<00:00:50.350> at<00:00:50.440> this<00:00:50.530> guy<00:00:50.770> right

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:50.800 
so let's take a look at this guy right

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.560 
so let's take a look at this guy right
here<00:00:51.399> and<00:00:51.520> look<00:00:52.059> at<00:00:52.210> a<00:00:52.239> few<00:00:52.539> different

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:52.570 
here and look at a few different

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:55.889 
here and look at a few different
scenarios<00:00:53.109> to<00:00:53.680> understand<00:00:54.160> role<00:00:54.370> conflict<00:00:54.899> so

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:55.899 
scenarios to understand role conflict so

00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:57.660 
scenarios to understand role conflict so
this<00:00:56.050> man<00:00:56.230> has<00:00:56.440> many<00:00:56.649> different<00:00:56.949> statuses

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:57.670 
this man has many different statuses

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:00.720 
this man has many different statuses
he's<00:00:57.940> a<00:00:57.969> student<00:00:58.510> he's<00:00:59.410> a<00:00:59.440> husband<00:01:00.129> he's<00:01:00.699> a

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:00.730 
he's a student he's a husband he's a

he's a student he's a husband he's a
friend<00:01:01.329> he's<00:01:01.629> a<00:01:01.660> worker<00:01:02.050> and<00:01:02.320> he's<00:01:02.469> also<00:01:02.620> a

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:02.800 
friend he's a worker and he's also a

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.730 
friend he's a worker and he's also a
parent<00:01:03.340> and<00:01:03.839> these<00:01:04.839> different<00:01:05.170> statuses<00:01:05.530> can

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:05.740 
parent and these different statuses can

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:07.800 
parent and these different statuses can
compete<00:01:06.130> for<00:01:06.400> his<00:01:06.490> time<00:01:06.790> so<00:01:07.420> let's<00:01:07.630> say<00:01:07.780> that

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:07.810 
compete for his time so let's say that

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:09.539 
compete for his time so let's say that
he<00:01:08.049> gets<00:01:08.259> a<00:01:08.409> call<00:01:08.680> from<00:01:08.710> one<00:01:09.070> of<00:01:09.189> his<00:01:09.310> buddies

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:23.920 
status as a husband should be more

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.100 
status as a husband should be more
important<00:01:24.310> that<00:01:24.430> his<00:01:24.579> status<00:01:24.850> as<00:01:25.119> a<00:01:25.180> friend<00:01:25.840> if

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.110 
important that his status as a friend if

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:29.069 
important that his status as a friend if
he's<00:01:26.710> smart<00:01:26.890> in<00:01:27.310> this<00:01:27.790> case<00:01:28.030> so<00:01:28.720> let's<00:01:28.869> take<00:01:29.049> a

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:29.079 
he's smart in this case so let's take a

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:31.469 
he's smart in this case so let's take a
look<00:01:29.259> at<00:01:29.409> another<00:01:29.649> scenario<00:01:30.009> here<00:01:30.579> let's<00:01:31.329> say

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:31.479 
look at another scenario here let's say

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:33.030 
look at another scenario here let's say
a<00:01:31.509> week<00:01:31.720> later<00:01:31.990> that<00:01:32.110> he<00:01:32.320> has<00:01:32.409> a<00:01:32.439> paper<00:01:32.740> to<00:01:32.890> do

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:33.040 
a week later that he has a paper to do

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.069 
a week later that he has a paper to do
for<00:01:33.250> school<00:01:33.549> but<00:01:33.939> he<00:01:34.030> finds<00:01:34.270> out<00:01:34.479> that<00:01:34.509> his<00:01:34.780> son

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:35.079 
for school but he finds out that his son

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:37.020 
for school but he finds out that his son
was<00:01:35.320> injured<00:01:35.890> and<00:01:36.100> he<00:01:36.340> may<00:01:36.520> need<00:01:36.640> to<00:01:36.700> go<00:01:36.880> to<00:01:36.909> the

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
was injured and he may need to go to the

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.300 
was injured and he may need to go to the
hospital<00:01:37.210> so<00:01:38.079> in<00:01:38.229> this<00:01:38.350> case<00:01:38.560> his<00:01:38.770> status<00:01:39.009> as<00:01:39.280> a

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:39.310 
hospital so in this case his status as a

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:41.310 
hospital so in this case his status as a
parent<00:01:39.790> may<00:01:40.270> take<00:01:40.509> precedence<00:01:41.020> over<00:01:41.170> his

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:41.320 
parent may take precedence over his

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:42.660 
parent may take precedence over his
