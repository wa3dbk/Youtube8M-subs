i guess i'll go ahead and pay attention
to<00:00:01.800> the<00:00:01.920> location<00:00:02.429> of<00:00:02.490> that<00:00:02.550> gas<00:00:02.909> tank<00:00:02.939> while

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:03.449 
to the location of that gas tank while

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:06.410 
to the location of that gas tank while
I'm<00:00:03.570> at<00:00:03.750> it<00:00:04.310> there's<00:00:05.310> the<00:00:05.520> gas<00:00:05.730> tank<00:00:06.120> back

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
I'm at it there's the gas tank back

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:09.140 
I'm at it there's the gas tank back
there<00:00:07.069> here's<00:00:08.069> the<00:00:08.280> hole<00:00:08.490> that<00:00:08.790> I<00:00:08.849> need<00:00:09.120> to

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
there here's the hole that I need to

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.839 
there here's the hole that I need to
weld<00:00:09.450> up<00:00:09.750> I<00:00:10.160> got<00:00:11.160> a<00:00:11.190> good<00:00:11.400> bit<00:00:11.580> of<00:00:11.610> space

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:11.849 
weld up I got a good bit of space

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:14.660 
weld up I got a good bit of space
between<00:00:11.910> that<00:00:12.450> hole<00:00:12.630> in<00:00:12.809> that<00:00:12.900> gas<00:00:13.200> tank<00:00:13.670> what

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:14.670 
between that hole in that gas tank what

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.340 
between that hole in that gas tank what
it<00:00:14.790> might<00:00:14.940> do<00:00:15.150> is<00:00:15.269> take<00:00:15.480> me<00:00:15.630> a<00:00:15.660> metal<00:00:16.020> shield

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:16.350 
it might do is take me a metal shield

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.540 
it might do is take me a metal shield
and<00:00:16.590> just<00:00:17.180> slide<00:00:18.180> it<00:00:18.390> up<00:00:18.539> in<00:00:18.779> here<00:00:19.109> and

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:19.550 
and just slide it up in here and

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:21.590 
and just slide it up in here and
position<00:00:20.550> it<00:00:20.670> in<00:00:20.789> such<00:00:21.000> a<00:00:21.029> way<00:00:21.150> where<00:00:21.480> it

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
position it in such a way where it

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.750 
position it in such a way where it
sparks<00:00:21.990> won't<00:00:22.500> get<00:00:22.710> to<00:00:22.890> it<00:00:23.010> and<00:00:23.130> then<00:00:23.279> I<00:00:23.430> can<00:00:23.609> go

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:23.760 
sparks won't get to it and then I can go

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.150 
sparks won't get to it and then I can go
ahead<00:00:23.910> and<00:00:24.080> cut<00:00:25.080> that<00:00:25.260> out<00:00:25.320> without<00:00:25.740> a<00:00:25.859> piece

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
ahead and cut that out without a piece

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.939 
ahead and cut that out without a piece
back<00:00:26.400> in<00:00:26.609> there<00:00:26.849> and<00:00:27.689> as<00:00:28.080> long<00:00:28.230> as<00:00:28.380> I<00:00:28.470> don't<00:00:28.619> set

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
back in there and as long as I don't set

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:31.279 
back in there and as long as I don't set
one<00:00:29.220> of<00:00:29.279> these<00:00:29.310> gas<00:00:29.670> lines<00:00:30.060> on<00:00:30.390> fire<00:00:30.720> something

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
one of these gas lines on fire something

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.970 
one of these gas lines on fire something
like<00:00:31.380> that<00:00:31.650> I<00:00:31.679> should<00:00:32.009> be<00:00:32.160> okay<00:00:33.829> that's<00:00:34.829> the

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:34.980 
like that I should be okay that's the

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:41.990 
like that I should be okay that's the
brake<00:00:35.219> line<00:00:40.010> that's<00:00:41.010> the<00:00:41.219> brake<00:00:41.430> line<00:00:41.670> and

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 
brake line that's the brake line and

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.369 
brake line that's the brake line and
that's<00:00:42.540> a<00:00:44.300> vent<00:00:45.300> for<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:45.629> rear<00:00:45.809> end<00:00:46.050> so<00:00:46.230> that's

00:00:46.369 --> 00:00:46.379 
that's a vent for the rear end so that's

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:51.049 
that's a vent for the rear end so that's
not<00:00:46.530> a<00:00:46.590> gas<00:00:46.890> line<00:00:47.219> so<00:00:47.670> I<00:00:47.940> believe<00:00:48.899> oh<00:00:49.700> yeah<00:00:50.700> see

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
not a gas line so I believe oh yeah see

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.110 
not a gas line so I believe oh yeah see
this<00:00:51.239> book<00:00:51.420> piece<00:00:51.570> of<00:00:51.750> stuff<00:00:52.739> right<00:00:53.039> here<00:00:53.120> and

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
this book piece of stuff right here and

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.910 
this book piece of stuff right here and
believe<00:00:54.510> that<00:00:54.570> probably<00:00:55.110> is<00:00:55.289> the<00:00:55.440> gas<00:00:55.649> line

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
believe that probably is the gas line

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.950 
believe that probably is the gas line
mrs.<00:00:56.309> right<00:00:56.520> under<00:00:56.820> what<00:00:57.000> I<00:00:57.030> need<00:00:57.270> to<00:00:57.360> cut<00:00:57.600> so

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
mrs. right under what I need to cut so

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.930 
mrs. right under what I need to cut so
oh<00:00:58.199> that's<00:00:59.190> going<00:00:59.340> to<00:00:59.399> give<00:00:59.550> me<00:00:59.579> something<00:00:59.850> to

oh that's going to give me something to

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.779 
oh that's going to give me something to
consider<00:01:00.350> which<00:01:01.350> I<00:01:01.559> will<00:01:01.770> do<00:01:02.010> I<00:01:02.039> will<00:01:02.219> consider

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.179 
them out I should have cut my holes from
my<00:01:29.729> floor<00:01:29.970> before<00:01:30.240> but<00:01:30.750> I<00:01:31.040> wasn't<00:01:32.040> paying

kind of crap which is rust coat coming
off<00:01:50.909> but

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:51.940 
off but

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.900 
off but
and<00:01:52.330> it<00:01:52.450> makes<00:01:52.690> it<00:01:52.810> look<00:01:52.960> worse<00:01:53.020> yes<00:01:53.910> but

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:54.910 
and it makes it look worse yes but

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:57.390 
and it makes it look worse yes but
actually<00:01:55.360> it's<00:01:56.290> good<00:01:56.470> metal<00:01:56.800> up<00:01:56.920> under<00:01:57.220> there

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:57.400 
actually it's good metal up under there

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.060 
actually it's good metal up under there
so<00:01:57.970> what<00:01:58.870> I'll<00:01:59.020> do<00:01:59.200> is<00:01:59.230> I'll<00:01:59.470> brush<00:01:59.710> all<00:01:59.920> this

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.070 
so what I'll do is I'll brush all this

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:01.680 
so what I'll do is I'll brush all this
up<00:02:00.220> I'm<00:02:00.400> an<00:02:00.520> all<00:02:00.790> coke<00:02:01.060> to<00:02:01.210> bottom<00:02:01.480> in<00:02:01.570> this

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:01.690 
up I'm an all coke to bottom in this

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:03.630 
up I'm an all coke to bottom in this
thing<00:02:01.900> I<00:02:02.050> like<00:02:02.440> that<00:02:02.650> all<00:02:02.830> code<00:02:03.130> better<00:02:03.400> than

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:03.640 
thing I like that all code better than

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.420 
thing I like that all code better than
this<00:02:03.790> Rusko<00:02:04.300> for<00:02:04.570> this<00:02:04.750> for<00:02:04.990> just<00:02:05.110> this<00:02:05.290> reason

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
this Rusko for this for just this reason

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.550 
this Rusko for this for just this reason
if<00:02:06.430> you<00:02:06.610> got<00:02:06.790> rust<00:02:07.090> coat<00:02:07.330> it<00:02:07.510> is<00:02:07.690> it<00:02:08.110> will<00:02:08.320> rust

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
if you got rust coat it is it will rust

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.360 
if you got rust coat it is it will rust
up<00:02:08.830> underneath<00:02:09.220> it<00:02:10.740> but<00:02:11.740> that<00:02:11.890> all<00:02:12.010> will

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:12.370 
up underneath it but that all will

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:15.630 
up underneath it but that all will
neutralize<00:02:13.240> the<00:02:13.480> rough<00:02:13.720> so<00:02:14.490> anyway<00:02:15.490> that's

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
neutralize the rough so anyway that's

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.550 
neutralize the rough so anyway that's
what<00:02:15.880> I'm<00:02:16.030> thinking<00:02:16.360> on<00:02:16.510> so<00:02:16.780> let<00:02:16.960> me<00:02:17.080> let<00:02:17.380> me

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
what I'm thinking on so let me let me

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.650 
what I'm thinking on so let me let me
get<00:02:17.770> back<00:02:17.800> to<00:02:18.190> where<00:02:18.340> i<00:02:18.430> was<00:02:18.460> i<00:02:18.760> start<00:02:19.420> working

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
get back to where i was i start working

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.040 
get back to where i was i start working
