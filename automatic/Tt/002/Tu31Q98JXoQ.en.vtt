00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:08.380 
attacks I've got a couple of exciting

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:10.709 
attacks I've got a couple of exciting
things<00:00:08.410> to<00:00:08.650> talk<00:00:08.889> about<00:00:09.190> today<00:00:09.550> the<00:00:09.759> first<00:00:10.120> is

00:00:10.709 --> 00:00:10.719 
things to talk about today the first is

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:13.440 
things to talk about today the first is
my<00:00:11.139> new<00:00:11.349> townhall<00:00:11.980> 10<00:00:12.280> defense<00:00:12.849> I<00:00:13.059> like<00:00:13.269> to

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:13.450 
my new townhall 10 defense I like to

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:16.770 
my new townhall 10 defense I like to
call<00:00:13.690> the<00:00:14.259> gala<00:00:14.650> trap<00:00:15.099> yes<00:00:15.820> it<00:00:16.090> is<00:00:16.240> probably

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:16.780 
call the gala trap yes it is probably

00:00:16.780 --> 00:00:19.260 
call the gala trap yes it is probably
the<00:00:17.020> most<00:00:17.260> successful<00:00:17.980> base<00:00:18.250> I've<00:00:18.550> ever<00:00:18.880> had

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:19.270 
the most successful base I've ever had

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:21.690 
the most successful base I've ever had
and<00:00:19.600> there's<00:00:20.440> a<00:00:20.500> couple<00:00:20.680> of<00:00:20.860> fundamentals<00:00:21.430> why

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:21.700 
and there's a couple of fundamentals why

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:22.830 
and there's a couple of fundamentals why
and<00:00:21.970> we're<00:00:22.090> going<00:00:22.210> to<00:00:22.240> talk<00:00:22.420> about<00:00:22.570> those

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:22.840 
and we're going to talk about those

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:24.630 
and we're going to talk about those
today<00:00:22.990> and<00:00:23.470> talk<00:00:23.830> about<00:00:24.040> how<00:00:24.160> they<00:00:24.340> can<00:00:24.370> be

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:24.640 
today and talk about how they can be

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.600 
today and talk about how they can be
replicated<00:00:25.240> in<00:00:25.360> any<00:00:25.630> high-level<00:00:26.080> base<00:00:26.580> now<00:00:27.580> I

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:27.610 
replicated in any high-level base now I

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:29.310 
replicated in any high-level base now I
say<00:00:28.000> high<00:00:28.180> level<00:00:28.540> base<00:00:28.720> because<00:00:29.140> I<00:00:29.230> think

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:29.320 
say high level base because I think

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.260 
say high level base because I think
pretty<00:00:29.710> much<00:00:29.800> you<00:00:30.070> probably<00:00:30.520> need<00:00:30.760> skeleton

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:31.270 
pretty much you probably need skeleton

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:33.270 
pretty much you probably need skeleton
traps<00:00:31.480> for<00:00:31.750> this<00:00:31.900> base<00:00:32.110> to<00:00:32.289> be<00:00:32.379> effective<00:00:32.860> so

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:33.280 
traps for this base to be effective so

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:34.950 
traps for this base to be effective so
we'll<00:00:33.430> take<00:00:33.579> a<00:00:33.640> look<00:00:33.850> at<00:00:34.059> it<00:00:34.180> here<00:00:34.450> it<00:00:34.810> is<00:00:34.840> a

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:34.960 
we'll take a look at it here it is a

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.319 
we'll take a look at it here it is a
pretty<00:00:35.350> much<00:00:35.650> looks<00:00:36.220> like<00:00:36.430> a<00:00:36.460> southern<00:00:36.940> teaser

00:00:37.319 --> 00:00:37.329 
pretty much looks like a southern teaser

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:39.840 
pretty much looks like a southern teaser
style<00:00:37.780> basis<00:00:38.200> we<00:00:38.320> used<00:00:38.500> to<00:00:38.620> call<00:00:38.800> it<00:00:39.010> open<00:00:39.550> from

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:39.850 
style basis we used to call it open from

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:41.880 
style basis we used to call it open from
the<00:00:40.030> bottom<00:00:40.450> lots<00:00:40.930> of<00:00:41.079> walls<00:00:41.290> from<00:00:41.530> the<00:00:41.650> top

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:41.890 
the bottom lots of walls from the top

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:44.250 
the bottom lots of walls from the top
very<00:00:42.220> difficult<00:00:42.730> to<00:00:42.850> get<00:00:43.030> to<00:00:43.060> with<00:00:43.900> the<00:00:43.989> jump

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:44.260 
very difficult to get to with the jump

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:45.990 
very difficult to get to with the jump

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:04.420 
all three Expos towards the top there is

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.149 
all three Expos towards the top there is
the<00:01:04.570> clan<00:01:04.780> castle<00:01:05.049> set<00:01:05.469> off<00:01:05.649> to<00:01:05.829> the<00:01:05.860> lower

the clan castle set off to the lower

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:08.340 
the clan castle set off to the lower
right<00:01:06.549> it's<00:01:07.210> also<00:01:07.390> discouraging<00:01:08.080> to<00:01:08.170> come

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:08.350 
right it's also discouraging to come

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:09.840 
right it's also discouraging to come
from<00:01:08.470> the<00:01:08.620> lower<00:01:08.799> left<00:01:09.100> because<00:01:09.460> you<00:01:09.580> can't

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:09.850 
from the lower left because you can't

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:11.580 
from the lower left because you can't
really<00:01:10.060> lure<00:01:10.299> the<00:01:10.479> clan<00:01:10.600> castle<00:01:10.960> very<00:01:11.350> well

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:13.870 
from there and you're also facing to

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:16.410 
from there and you're also facing to
Inferno<00:01:14.290> towers<00:01:14.860> right<00:01:15.610> at<00:01:15.760> your<00:01:15.880> attacking

I've had with this village since the

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.199 
I've had with this village since the
update<00:02:26.650> I<00:02:26.680> had<00:02:26.980> defended<00:02:27.490> with<00:02:27.610> it<00:02:27.760> before<00:02:27.910> the

00:02:28.199 --> 00:02:28.209 
update I had defended with it before the

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:30.240 
update I had defended with it before the
update<00:02:28.360> bottom<00:02:29.170> right<00:02:29.350> you<00:02:29.530> see<00:02:29.709> he<00:02:29.830> sends<00:02:30.160> in

update bottom right you see he sends in

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.760 
update bottom right you see he sends in
a<00:02:30.370> feeler<00:02:31.200> wallbreaker<00:02:32.200> there<00:02:32.530> gets

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:32.770 
a feeler wallbreaker there gets

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:34.770 
a feeler wallbreaker there gets
completely<00:02:33.280> obliterated<00:02:34.030> by<00:02:34.120> that<00:02:34.300> big<00:02:34.540> bomb

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:34.780

and also alerts one of the skeleton

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:38.880 
and also alerts one of the skeleton

just got vaporized there and sent into

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:14.580 
just got vaporized there and sent into
space<00:03:12.209> so<00:03:13.209> a<00:03:13.239> partial<00:03:13.630> activation<00:03:14.410> of<00:03:14.470> the

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:14.590 
space so a partial activation of the

space so a partial activation of the
clan<00:03:14.800> castle<00:03:15.040> we<00:03:15.820> can<00:03:16.000> see<00:03:16.180> that<00:03:16.360> he<00:03:16.480> just<00:03:16.510> got

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959

here<00:05:44.650> being<00:05:45.220> that<00:05:45.610> obviously<00:05:46.450> it's<00:05:46.690> not<00:05:46.810> going

00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:47.020 
here being that obviously it's not going

00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:49.050 
here being that obviously it's not going
to<00:05:47.080> be<00:05:47.200> undefeated<00:05:47.830> but<00:05:48.220> if<00:05:48.340> the<00:05:48.460> losses<00:05:48.910> are

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:49.060 
to be undefeated but if the losses are

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:51.960 
to be undefeated but if the losses are
held<00:05:49.419> to<00:05:49.630> one<00:05:49.870> star<00:05:50.290> that<00:05:50.800> can<00:05:51.040> be<00:05:51.220> significant
