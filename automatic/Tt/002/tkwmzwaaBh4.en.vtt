00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.330
 I saw only a second before the 

00:00:01.709 --> 00:00:05.490
 video guys because I have to tell you two 

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.460
 things then practically the video of 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.830
 today I had to go out tomorrow, however, since 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.500
 he had trouble with scares 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:16.109
 for our work together our 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.640
 video together then is postponed to 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.820
 tomorrow the video with beautiful and then 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.519
 another thing I suspended, that is 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:25.019
 definitely canceled the walk through of 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.029
 call of duty because you don't pay me 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.220
 nobody therefore useless that I quote loses 4 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:31.920
 3 hours of tare to mount not to mention 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.750
 of the blog then said fuck me I stop it 

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.059
 so guys , I'll leave you to the video 

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.649
 having said that I recommend commenting 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.489
 with what I will ask you I leave you 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:40.489
 the inter or bona 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:54.469
 word in the violet all boys 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.420
 welcome back 

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:58.850
 today we are with a different video from 

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:02.719
 usually we are on clash of plants 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:05.030
 because I found the cable to record 

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:07.909
 from the iphone so will be going to 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.800
 let's start say a new series together 

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:12.380
 to you here is already beginning exposed to the stuff 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:15.710
 which is not good in the sense the series 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:19.399
 together with you it would be that if you want 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:22.250
 had games by phone for 

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:24.950
 android or for iphone 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:28.850
 tell me that I Lerici are meanwhile there 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:30.890
 we do not know what in the now or now 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.710
 clash because we say that the game more 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:36.229
 famous that there is to show some 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.220
 my village let's say farming 

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:39.920
 as they say 

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:43.399
 and then I'll show you some attacks 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:45.740
 to make so much money and so much there 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:48.649
 however, he says let's say this 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:50.509
 series that I would like to start will be you 

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:53.030
 maybe you recommend me games and me there 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:54.979
 I will take on the canal so let's see some 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.929
 if you like clash of plans maybe 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:57.500
 we find something nice to do in 

00:01:56.929 --> 00:02:00.709
 flash 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.720
 let me know below in the comments and 

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:04.670
 like me and sign up for seeds 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:06.410
 undress then the boys now we go 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.729
 to look for an opponent who meanwhile 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:09.619
 the games arrive 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:11.360
 perfume is beautiful the reggina as it is beautiful 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:12.620
 the reggina that the barbarian is not seen on 

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.800
 bar bar 

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:17.180
 so he's doing everything I'm doing 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.870
 some special stuff goes to make up 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:23.050
 here, however, we are going to attack ea 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:26.050
 to make a little gold is a bit of leasing 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:28.910
 even on the shield but who cares 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:30.500
 ok let's say i attack with 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.870
 archers because now I'll show you 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:35.360
 if we find a good village with the 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.700
 discovered resources this gives us quite a bit 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:40.430
 however they are internal so let's avoid 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:44.030
 you can attack him with the archers 

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:48.129
 much better to steal now I'll do it 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:48.129
 see as soon as I find a fucking village 

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:59.590
 ok guys we found a village 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:01.060
 with 119 thousand euros as you see here son 

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.489
 full this was I threw a 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:06.730
 archer by mistake, however, does so 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:09.400
 put it now I throw them before that 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:11.290
 archers choose us not to defend ourselves 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.150
 break archery boxes as le 

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:15.220
 prisons are weaker than that 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:18.849
 crazy deployed on this other side 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:21.519
 so maybe you do a little more damage 

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:25.720
 trying to arrive maybe all 80 and all 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:29.500
 80 to 50 percent and more damage do 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:32.139
 the better the better it would be to try the 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:34.299
 out of town, however, there is no 

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:37.480
 poor town hall here more balls these 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:39.730
 games that arrive anyway we have 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:42.010
 already taken let's say pretty much everything 

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:43.870
 the gold that is almost there 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:47.049
 now here is another bit of elixir and if 

00:03:43.870 --> 00:03:49.450
 we can get it here now we can 

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:52.480
 make the di ose steal also in 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:55.470
 stolen city ​​hall destroy I am a 

00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:58.750
 asshole because I put it all together 

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:02.199
 but maybe guys maybe we can to 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:04.359
 do a lot of damage a lot if there 

00:04:02.199 --> 00:04:06.940
 let's all get there maybe xvi doesn't come 

00:04:04.359 --> 00:04:09.099
 the mortar that destroys us 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:11.769
 completely all with one stroke ascone 

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:14.079
 what level is it would not hurt not 

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:16.349
 it would be absolutely not bad 

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:18.729
 we have climbed all the troops 

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:20.409
 we say that there is also the towers of the 

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:22.479
 sorcerer who broke out highly 

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:23.979
 but honestly we say that boxes 

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:26.380
 we have already done 90 percent e 

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:27.789
 we completely stole everything from 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:29.860
 she 

00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:31.360
 practically yes we stole due there 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:34.150
 they are survivors of the little ones 

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:35.710
 survivors who will now almost die 

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:38.590
 surely they will die because there is the 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:41.440
 deadly that is the chelsea tower 

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:43.599
 of the archer of the sorcerer match of 

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:45.669
 shit offends we say that maybe there is 

00:04:43.599 --> 00:04:47.710
 if we can destroy it what not 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:49.780
 I think so 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:51.520
 instead we guys did 100 

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:52.900
 percent very well seen you saw 

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:55.180
 what we have now taken with the archers 

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:56.790
 we say it is an easy way because 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:00.780
 archers not 

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:02.970
 consume a tube that does not consume a 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:06.960
 tube does not cost a tumor I have it a 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:10.470
 level 5 costs a 200 I do 195 

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:12.810
 Mycenae are 15th I don't consume so much 

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:17.240
 with 100,000 Elysiums we have resumed 

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:18.780
 all costs more or less 40,000 and 50,000 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:22.860
 simple 

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:24.840
 so guys the video ends here 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:27.450
 I hope you enjoyed my course 

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:29.010
 I recommend left a nice comment and 

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:32.160
 let me know what you most asked 

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:35.400
 first then put like obviously because 

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:38.300
 the like is a must and nothing to see 

00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:38.300
 to an upcoming video
