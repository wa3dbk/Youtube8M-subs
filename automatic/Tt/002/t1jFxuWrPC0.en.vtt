 at any cost seek a change of power 

00:00:07.509 --> 00:00:12.150
 by street hooliganism by the way 

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:14.110
 Ukrainian legislation 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.869
 limiting the so -called freedom 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:18.849
 assembly is no worse than the recent 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:21.279
 Spanish law reported 

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:22.749
 Six weeks ago, there are now 

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:24.640

 regime change of government in the European Union 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:44.380
 want to influence Ukraine in 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.270
 long term business is not 

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:50.980
 economic aspirations it's just 

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:53.140
 eastward expansion is not the point 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:55.510
 four years ago in Ukraine passed 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:58.090
 elections that were declared free 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.980

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:09.549
 then the protesters don't wait until 

00:01:05.259 --> 00:01:11.890
 elections in the spring of 2015 we give 

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:13.359
 understand that we support the background we saw 

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:15.399
 as a former foreign minister 

00:01:13.359 --> 00:01:16.600
 Germany Guido Westerwelle official 

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:18.880
 state representative

 usa victoria nuland handing out 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.479
 Kiev on the barricades of cookies you can 

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:24.670
 imagine that the foreign minister 

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:26.649
 affairs of russia sergey laurels came to 

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:29.350
 barcelona to support catalan 

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:31.149
 separatists in Ukraine, we are seeing 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.759
 government's excessive patience by 

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:35.200
 relation to such street violence is not 

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:38.619
 would have allowed in washington 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:40.590
 london or brussels was thrown here 

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:43.299
 Bandera but what caused 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.579
 Demonstrations The reason for the demonstration was 

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:47.770
 the fact that President Yanukovych and Ukrainian 

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:49.840
 government under pressure from Moscow under 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:51.969
 pressure of Russia at the last moment 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:55.869
 refused to sign an agreement on 

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:57.819
 associate membership congress no 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:59.950
 sorry you admit the fact logical 

00:01:57.819 --> 00:02:01.840
 mistake you talk about the situation when 

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:04.840
 President Yanukovych had every right 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.520
 say no terrible agreement which 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.040
 in case of signing it would cost 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.550
 Ukraine tens of billions of euros of which 

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:13.370
 Kiev could not afford 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:15.550
 whereas Russia helped Ukraine 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.990
 in the amount of 15 billion dollars 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:20.150
 Europe obviously wanted to get 

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:22.430
 freely free access to Ukrainian 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:25.370
 the market and the thing here is solely in 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:27.550
 geopolitics it was the political 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:27.550
 alone
