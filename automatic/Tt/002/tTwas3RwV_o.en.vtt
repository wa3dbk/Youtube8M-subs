00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 hey people here are so fergie and i am 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.350
 and perhaps already have that 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:10.260
 video on mikes channel seen in the me 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:12.420
 the nexus 7 as a monitor and control unit 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:15.870
 have presented for your dslr camera 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:17.940
 if not then look closely and 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.160
 what do we show in this video how to do it 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.510
 the whole mounted because it is so 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.920
 actually quite as practical because in 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.769
 One hand holding the tray in the 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.930
 the other camera and how it is now 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:29.640
 the zoom or how the focus is on the 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:32.210
 Child childish or with the feet 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.559
 somehow I get that too 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:38.040
 you have the luxury and someone has that 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:40.110
 then external but does not assume 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.930
 but get on the cameras is now 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:45.930
 not really objective either 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.280
 balanced a bit though 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.500
 Of course not the cleanest solution 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.300
 That's why the voerder something quite 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.890
 Great thought because its holder 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.199
 Of course you can buy directly too 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.120
 for something but the general tablet 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.910
 bracket but quite expensive 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.430
 yes, the cost of 80 to 100 euros or so 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:06.270
 and is so flexible and in the 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:09.180
 aging that really know creatively 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.290
 just be yourself something 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.510
 together what exactly that is because 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.220
 always the most important creativity and front 

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:15.420
 Doing everything yourself is easy 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:17.100
 give it a try and do it like that 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.810
 does not have to work 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.979
 always be the perfect solution 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.110
 the main thing is it works and it works 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:24.150
 does his job what do you have now 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.729
 done to make it so it is 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.630
 So the power is just here 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.280
 a pill 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.860
 that's a normal cover it 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.030
 here also flexible which protects on the one hand 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.380
 of course, the tray if it is 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.240
 flies down or with the camera on 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:40.650
 tripod yes and on the other normal 

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.970
 I could also leave it out now 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.439
 comes the second point I have here 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:44.820
 mounted on the bottom of such a hot shoe 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:46.770
 that's just a normal one 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.829
 screen with such a one-quarter inch 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.840
 thread and i could do it directly too 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.340
 stick to the tray that is 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.229
 namely now with double supplier so 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.640
 That may be something amateurish but link 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:58.950
 that the double tape but that holds 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:02.909
 really no marching and shaking 

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:05.719
 all that is bombproof and me 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:09.369
 anyway the best friend of the camera 

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:12.159
 People double tape gaffer 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:14.470
 so you can do everything you could 

00:02:12.159 --> 00:02:18.730
 of course also drill or with 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:20.140
 any other pages but if 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.909
 it works then works exactly 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.430
 that's what it's important for me to do 

00:02:21.909 --> 00:02:26.739
 not not directly to the camera 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:28.150
 have to stick to it must have stuck 

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:29.709
 I just took cover thus I am 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:31.959
 flexible to singing without them 

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:39.310
 this beach or still want to be 

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:40.290
 and that was it, that's kind of like that 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.970
 magic on 

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.319
 that has on one side got it in 

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:46.599
 connection for a picture because I think 

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:50.680
 I just go in here up here 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:51.940
 make him stuck on the other side 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.299
 it is quite normal tripod thread 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:55.989
 connection as well to a plane that 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:58.540
 come down there 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:03:00.730
 wonderfully pure and then I can 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:03.010
 in that is so flexible I can 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.170
 to align that as I want that right now 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.940
 Great if you go to any stupid 

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:08.799
 position is and maybe the monitor 

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:09.549
 times on the side needs or up 

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:12.099
 or down 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:15.730
 therefore flexible and you can stay here 

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:19.630
 screw down and then almost say drops 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:22.599
 it's great season everything works 

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:25.329
 what did that cost now ramms space 

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:27.700
 built 30 40 euro so about half 

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:35.260
 taken from the finished solution and and 

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:37.660
 is much more flexible the links to the 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:39.129
 all the things we used here 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:40.359
 you can also find it below in the video 

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:42.160
 description if the whole time 

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:43.510
 if you want another copy 

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.699
 Of course you need a tablet 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:47.530
 other cover otherwise it is not like you 

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:49.930
 which connects the tablet to the camera 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:51.519
 and what you need for it you can find in 

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:53.379
 video on my channel in case it still 

00:03:51.519 --> 00:03:55.629
 did not see that was true 

00:03:53.379 --> 00:04:01.989
 Of course, the voerder also makes clear 

00:03:55.629 --> 00:04:03.010
 great easy with the bus jersey 

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:04.989
 connect 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:06.879
 I still have cable ties here or 

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:08.109
 with the cable a little bit to pinch 

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:09.879
 made it smaller so he does not have that much 

00:04:08.109 --> 00:04:10.510
 Of course you can eat salad 

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:12.790
 on 

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:14.080
 buy a shorter cable I have it 

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:15.610
 very happy about the longer that I to 

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:17.109
 for example, the cables also the camera 

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:17.709
 can put up somewhere else and here 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:19.660
 Operating the 

00:04:17.709 --> 00:04:23.500
 That's why I think that's just it 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:26.500
 the solution exactly or otherwise 6 channel 

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:28.030
 From subscribes to the channel and gives the 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.770
 thumb up if you like the video 

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:32.070
 liked and hopefully too 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:34.810
 did not forget to subscribe 

00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:36.880
 and also like your solutions if you 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:38.320
 Even something like that uses your solution 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:39.940
 below in the comments 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.169
 just in case you have something else 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:43.240
 it was somehow different 

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:44.800
 made likes to write down in the 

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.539
 comments as us, of course, too 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.830
 We are not always interested in exciting things 

00:04:46.539 --> 00:04:50.530
 to know how it is we have it 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:52.600
 others made and when it builds up 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:54.460
 then write down in the kita 

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:56.520
 or send a picture of it like this 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:58.060
 has recreated because it is cool too 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:00.539
 then we'll see each other in the next 

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:00.539
 videos
