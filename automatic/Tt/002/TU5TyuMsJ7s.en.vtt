stand there waiting for your boat every
single<00:00:36.450> time<00:00:36.660> now<00:00:37.320> basically<00:00:37.649> when<00:00:38.190> a

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
single time now basically when a

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.160 
single time now basically when a
windmill<00:00:38.670> gets<00:00:38.940> taken<00:00:39.149> down<00:00:39.329> as<00:00:39.660> you<00:00:39.780> can<00:00:39.960> see

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:40.170 
windmill gets taken down as you can see

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.020 
windmill gets taken down as you can see
earlier<00:00:40.590> in<00:00:40.739> the<00:00:40.829> gameplay<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.670> boat<00:00:41.850> will<00:00:42.000> be

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
earlier in the gameplay the boat will be

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.639 
earlier in the gameplay the boat will be
set<00:00:42.329> free<00:00:42.540> and<00:00:42.600> it<00:00:42.870> will<00:00:42.989> go<00:00:43.140> towards<00:00:43.530> the

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
set free and it will go towards the

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.229 
set free and it will go towards the
island<00:00:44.010> now<00:00:44.160> this<00:00:44.309> is<00:00:44.430> probably<00:00:44.610> one<00:00:44.910> of<00:00:44.940> the

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
island now this is probably one of the

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.270 
island now this is probably one of the
better<00:00:45.480> examples<00:00:45.570> of<00:00:46.289> what<00:00:46.469> evolution<00:00:46.770> is

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
better examples of what evolution is

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.470 
better examples of what evolution is
going<00:00:47.550> to<00:00:47.640> be<00:00:47.789> like<00:00:48.000> in<00:00:48.149> battle<00:00:48.420> before

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
going to be like in battle before

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.779 
going to be like in battle before
obviously<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.680> skyscraper<00:00:50.280> falling<00:00:50.550> down<00:00:50.670> is

00:00:50.779 --> 00:00:50.789 
obviously the skyscraper falling down is

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:52.369 
obviously the skyscraper falling down is
probably<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:51.180> best<00:00:51.390> example<00:00:51.570> but<00:00:52.079> this<00:00:52.170> is

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
probably the best example but this is

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.619 
probably the best example but this is
pretty<00:00:52.710> awesome<00:00:53.039> as<00:00:53.730> you<00:00:53.850> can<00:00:53.969> see<00:00:54.120> I<00:00:54.149> giant

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
pretty awesome as you can see I giant

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.479 
pretty awesome as you can see I giant
ship<00:00:54.870> just<00:00:55.050> crashed<00:00:55.410> into<00:00:55.680> the<00:00:55.890> control<00:00:56.250> point

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
ship just crashed into the control point

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.610 
ship just crashed into the control point
sea<00:00:56.760> and<00:00:57.000> it<00:00:57.390> totally<00:00:57.840> just<00:00:58.079> changed<00:00:58.500> the

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
sea and it totally just changed the

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.290 
sea and it totally just changed the
whole<00:00:58.829> way<00:00:59.100> people<00:00:59.489> would<00:00:59.579> play<00:00:59.940> on<00:00:59.969> this

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
whole way people would play on this

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.610 
whole way people would play on this
control<00:01:00.660> point<00:01:00.809> because<00:01:01.109> there's<00:01:01.260> a<00:01:01.379> giant

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
control point because there's a giant

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.650 
control point because there's a giant
boat<00:01:01.949> you<00:01:02.129> can<00:01:02.280> hide<00:01:02.520> on<00:01:02.670> you<00:01:03.030> can<00:01:03.180> go<00:01:03.329> on<00:01:03.449> top

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
boat you can hide on you can go on top

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.660 
boat you can hide on you can go on top
of<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:03.899> boat<00:01:04.110> shoot<00:01:04.409> from<00:01:04.589> there<00:01:04.830> you<00:01:05.309> can<00:01:05.519> go

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:05.670 
of the boat shoot from there you can go

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.580 
of the boat shoot from there you can go
into<00:01:05.790> ruin<00:01:06.119> building<00:01:06.540> and<00:01:06.689> hide<00:01:06.900> there<00:01:07.229> if<00:01:07.470> you

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
into ruin building and hide there if you

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.609 
into ruin building and hide there if you
take<00:01:07.860> a<00:01:08.100> it's<00:01:08.850> an<00:01:09.030> anti-air<00:01:09.720> on<00:01:09.990> top<00:01:10.350> of<00:01:10.470> the

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
take a it's an anti-air on top of the

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.800 
take a it's an anti-air on top of the
boats<00:01:10.890> so<00:01:11.460> basically<00:01:11.970> if<00:01:12.150> you<00:01:12.210> hold<00:01:12.540> the

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
boats so basically if you hold the

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.539 
boats so basically if you hold the
control<00:01:13.170> point<00:01:13.380> see<00:01:13.619> you<00:01:14.040> can<00:01:14.220> take<00:01:14.340> control

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
control point see you can take control

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.490 
control point see you can take control
over<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.420> anti-air<00:01:15.900> and<00:01:16.110> that<00:01:16.200> was<00:01:16.320> totally

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
over the anti-air and that was totally

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.620 
over the anti-air and that was totally
change<00:01:16.860> the<00:01:16.920> game<00:01:17.159> plays<00:01:17.430> I<00:01:17.610> mean<00:01:17.640> Jets<00:01:18.420> are

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
change the game plays I mean Jets are

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.240 
change the game plays I mean Jets are
going<00:01:18.840> to<00:01:18.930> have<00:01:19.020> to<00:01:19.110> maneuver<00:01:19.380> away<00:01:19.890> from<00:01:20.130> the

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
going to have to maneuver away from the

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.070 
going to have to maneuver away from the
boats<00:01:20.490> helicopters<00:01:20.700> can't<00:01:21.360> really<00:01:21.630> go<00:01:21.780> close

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
boats helicopters can't really go close

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.749 
boats helicopters can't really go close
to<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.350> control<00:01:22.680> point<00:01:22.890> so<00:01:23.310> we're<00:01:23.400> gonna<00:01:23.490> have

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
to the control point so we're gonna have

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.789 
to the control point so we're gonna have
to<00:01:23.939> approach<00:01:24.509> with<00:01:24.869> infantry<00:01:25.439> which<00:01:25.680> is

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:25.799 
to approach with infantry which is

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:27.260 
to approach with infantry which is
totally<00:01:26.130> gonna<00:01:26.250> change<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:26.670> gameplay<00:01:26.880> for

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
totally gonna change the gameplay for

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.120 
totally gonna change the gameplay for
the<00:01:27.420> sea<00:01:27.600> control<00:01:27.990> point<00:01:28.229> again<00:01:28.680> as<00:01:28.890> I<00:01:28.979> already

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
the sea control point again as I already

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.280 
the sea control point again as I already
mentioned<00:01:29.430> this<00:01:30.329> will<00:01:30.509> happen<00:01:30.630> everything

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:31.290 
mentioned this will happen everything

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.499 
mentioned this will happen everything
around<00:01:31.799> you<00:01:32.040> play<00:01:32.220> this<00:01:32.400> map<00:01:32.640> the<00:01:33.150> windmill

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
around you play this map the windmill

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:34.969 
around you play this map the windmill
will<00:01:33.659> fall<00:01:33.930> and<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:34.200> boat<00:01:34.409> will<00:01:34.590> come<00:01:34.770> in

00:01:34.969 --> 00:01:34.979 
will fall and the boat will come in

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:36.620 
will fall and the boat will come in
towards<00:01:35.430> the<00:01:35.490> island<00:01:36.030> although<00:01:36.240> I'm<00:01:36.479> not

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
towards the island although I'm not

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:37.789 
towards the island although I'm not
quite<00:01:36.689> sure<00:01:36.840> if<00:01:37.049> you<00:01:37.170> can<00:01:37.259> actually<00:01:37.560> boost

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799 
quite sure if you can actually boost

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:39.499 
quite sure if you can actually boost
this<00:01:38.040> event<00:01:38.400> by<00:01:38.579> shooting<00:01:38.970> at<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.210> windmill

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
this event by shooting at the windmill

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.240 
this event by shooting at the windmill
because<00:01:40.110> right<00:01:40.320> before<00:01:40.470> it<00:01:40.770> gets<00:01:40.920> taken<00:01:41.100> down

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
because right before it gets taken down

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.649 
because right before it gets taken down
you<00:01:41.430> can<00:01:41.549> see<00:01:41.640> a<00:01:41.670> lot<00:01:41.880> of<00:01:41.909> people<00:01:42.060> shooting<00:01:42.450> and

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:42.659 
you can see a lot of people shooting and

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.149 
you can see a lot of people shooting and
it<00:01:42.750> you<00:01:42.840> can<00:01:42.990> see<00:01:43.110> just<00:01:43.409> trying<00:01:43.710> to<00:01:43.829> take<00:01:44.009> it

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
it you can see just trying to take it

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.950 
it you can see just trying to take it
down<00:01:44.340> so<00:01:44.850> I<00:01:44.880> will<00:01:45.090> just<00:01:45.270> have<00:01:45.390> to<00:01:45.509> wait<00:01:45.659> and<00:01:45.840> see

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
down so I will just have to wait and see

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:47.210 
down so I will just have to wait and see
for<00:01:46.170> that<00:01:46.229> I'm<00:01:46.409> not<00:01:46.590> quite<00:01:46.829> sure<00:01:46.860> how<00:01:47.189> that

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
for that I'm not quite sure how that

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.800 
for that I'm not quite sure how that
actually<00:01:47.520> works<00:01:47.700> yet<00:01:48.149> but<00:01:48.360> as<00:01:48.450> you<00:01:48.540> can<00:01:48.659> see

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:48.810 
actually works yet but as you can see

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:50.300 
actually works yet but as you can see
here<00:01:49.049> people<00:01:49.259> are<00:01:49.439> already<00:01:49.710> starting<00:01:49.950> to

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:50.310 
here people are already starting to

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:52.310 
here people are already starting to
climb<00:01:50.640> on<00:01:50.820> top<00:01:50.850> of<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.210> boat<00:01:51.420> to<00:01:51.899> get<00:01:51.990> up<00:01:52.140> there

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
climb on top of the boat to get up there

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.139 
climb on top of the boat to get up there
and<00:01:52.470> get<00:01:52.680> to<00:01:52.799> height<00:01:53.009> advantage<00:01:53.280> over<00:01:53.820> their

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
and get to height advantage over their

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.370 
and get to height advantage over their
enemies<00:01:54.329> now<00:01:54.689> that's<00:01:54.869> that's<00:01:55.110> gonna<00:01:55.290> be

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380 
enemies now that's that's gonna be

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:57.260 
enemies now that's that's gonna be
pretty<00:01:55.560> cool<00:01:55.920> to<00:01:56.100> see<00:01:56.130> because<00:01:56.909> this<00:01:57.030> boat

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
pretty cool to see because this boat

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:58.760 
pretty cool to see because this boat
just<00:01:57.450> gives<00:01:57.659> a<00:01:57.750> whole<00:01:57.990> new<00:01:58.140> perspective<00:01:58.469> to

00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.770 
just gives a whole new perspective to

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.560 
just gives a whole new perspective to
the<00:01:58.890> whole<00:01:59.070> game<00:01:59.369> plan<00:01:59.399> how<00:01:59.759> sea<00:02:00.270> is<00:02:00.329> just

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:00.570 
the whole game plan how sea is just

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:01.670 
the whole game plan how sea is just
gonna<00:02:00.659> be<00:02:00.780> played<00:02:00.990> out<00:02:01.110> because<00:02:01.380> if<00:02:01.560> you're

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
gonna be played out because if you're

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.429 
gonna be played out because if you're
coming<00:02:01.890> from<00:02:01.979> an<00:02:02.189> island<00:02:02.399> from<00:02:02.820> across<00:02:03.240> sea<00:02:03.509> or

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
coming from an island from across sea or

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:05.780 
coming from an island from across sea or
across<00:02:04.710> the<00:02:04.860> boat<00:02:05.040> you<00:02:05.219> can<00:02:05.340> actually<00:02:05.460> see

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
across the boat you can actually see

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.580 
across the boat you can actually see
that<00:02:06.090> there's<00:02:06.390> no<00:02:06.509> cover<00:02:06.840> at<00:02:07.079> all<00:02:07.259> but<00:02:07.469> once

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:07.590 
that there's no cover at all but once

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.050 
that there's no cover at all but once
the<00:02:07.710> boat<00:02:07.920> is<00:02:08.099> there<00:02:08.250> you<00:02:08.369> can<00:02:08.489> climb<00:02:08.700> on<00:02:08.879> top

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:09.060 
the boat is there you can climb on top

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:10.969 
the boat is there you can climb on top
of<00:02:09.239> it<00:02:09.390> and<00:02:09.660> it<00:02:09.840> can<00:02:09.929> move<00:02:10.140> by<00:02:10.379> the<00:02:10.440> boat<00:02:10.739> and

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
of it and it can move by the boat and

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.250 
of it and it can move by the boat and
actually<00:02:11.250> get<00:02:11.400> sea

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260 
actually get sea

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.619 
actually get sea
much<00:02:12.439> easier<00:02:12.470> way<00:02:13.069> so<00:02:13.730> I<00:02:14.090> think<00:02:14.239> it's<00:02:14.390> gonna<00:02:14.480> be

00:02:14.619 --> 00:02:14.629 
much easier way so I think it's gonna be

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:15.970 
much easier way so I think it's gonna be
quite<00:02:14.780> interesting<00:02:14.840> to<00:02:15.409> see<00:02:15.530> how<00:02:15.650> it<00:02:15.769> plays

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
quite interesting to see how it plays

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:17.710 
quite interesting to see how it plays
out<00:02:16.159> once<00:02:16.400> the<00:02:16.549> boat<00:02:16.730> is<00:02:16.970> placed<00:02:17.239> there<00:02:17.510> but

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:17.720 
out once the boat is placed there but

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:19.000 
out once the boat is placed there but
that<00:02:17.810> pretty<00:02:17.959> much<00:02:18.110> sums<00:02:18.409> it<00:02:18.530> up<00:02:18.620> I<00:02:18.739> think<00:02:18.799> I've

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
that pretty much sums it up I think I've

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.500 
that pretty much sums it up I think I've
talked<00:02:19.250> about<00:02:19.489> everything<00:02:19.760> that<00:02:19.909> I<00:02:20.030> wanted<00:02:20.390> to

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
talked about everything that I wanted to

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:22.179 
talked about everything that I wanted to
talk<00:02:20.750> about<00:02:21.019> I<00:02:21.230> hope<00:02:21.470> you<00:02:21.560> guys<00:02:21.680> enjoyed<00:02:22.069> this
