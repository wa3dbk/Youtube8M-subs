you can see with the follow focus the
friction<00:01:49.189> shape<00:01:50.189> has<00:01:50.340> developed<00:01:50.790> a<00:01:50.880> new

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:51.290 
friction shape has developed a new

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:54.770 
friction shape has developed a new
viewfinder<00:01:52.290> holder<00:01:52.590> for<00:01:52.979> the<00:01:53.240> black<00:01:54.240> magic<00:01:54.659> as
