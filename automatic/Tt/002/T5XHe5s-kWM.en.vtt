00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
I think she's a fairly new artist she's

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.999 
I think she's a fairly new artist she's
I<00:01:18.119> think<00:01:18.270> she's<00:01:18.570> located<00:01:19.020> in<00:01:19.259> Australia<00:01:19.830> I'm

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
I think she's located in Australia I'm

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.859 
I think she's located in Australia I'm
not<00:01:20.189> really<00:01:20.369> sure<00:01:20.490> I<00:01:21.000> know<00:01:21.270> the<00:01:21.390> song<00:01:21.689> was

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
not really sure I know the song was

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.960 
not really sure I know the song was
recorded<00:01:22.229> in<00:01:22.560> Australia<00:01:23.070> but<00:01:23.250> I'm<00:01:23.729> not<00:01:23.850> one

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:23.970 
recorded in Australia but I'm not one

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.429 
recorded in Australia but I'm not one
hundred<00:01:24.030> percent<00:01:24.210> sure<00:01:24.570> so<00:01:24.930> I<00:01:24.960> think<00:01:25.110> she's

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439 
hundred percent sure so I think she's

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:27.230 
hundred percent sure so I think she's
somewhat<00:01:25.860> fairly<00:01:26.280> new<00:01:26.520> to<00:01:26.549> the<00:01:26.850> music

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
somewhat fairly new to the music

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.679

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:40.250 
guess it's just boast to be like a

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:41.979 
guess it's just boast to be like a
regularly<00:03:40.700> deodorant<00:03:41.209> but<00:03:41.420> it's<00:03:41.600> supposed<00:03:41.840> to

00:03:41.979 --> 00:03:41.989

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.540 
be a lot more potent and a lot more
strong<00:03:44.600> so<00:03:45.260> it's<00:03:45.650> supposed<00:03:45.769> to<00:03:45.980> be<00:03:46.130> stronger

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:46.550
