roundness<00:03:55.890> in<00:03:56.280> this<00:03:56.430> music<00:03:56.760> which<00:03:56.910> I<00:03:57.090> also

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:57.240 
roundness in this music which I also

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:59.480 
roundness in this music which I also
wanted<00:03:57.660> to<00:03:57.720> to<00:03:58.560> give<00:03:58.740> them<00:03:58.890> a<00:03:59.010> sacred<00:03:59.370> music

00:03:59.480 --> 00:03:59.490 
wanted to to give them a sacred music

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:02.540 
wanted to to give them a sacred music
has<00:03:59.910> these<00:04:00.500> church<00:04:01.500> walls<00:04:02.010> you<00:04:02.280> know<00:04:02.340> the

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:02.550 
has these church walls you know the

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:05.750 
has these church walls you know the
history<00:04:03.060> and<00:04:03.210> the<00:04:03.480> conf<00:04:03.780> would<00:04:04.350> itself<00:04:04.830> that

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
history and the conf would itself that

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.460 
history and the conf would itself that
was<00:04:05.910> the<00:04:06.030> idea<00:04:06.300> just<00:04:06.570> to<00:04:06.630> have<00:04:06.870> a<00:04:07.050> little<00:04:07.350> bit

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
was the idea just to have a little bit

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:18.360 
was the idea just to have a little bit
from<00:04:07.650> everything<00:04:08.070> United<00:04:08.820> in<00:04:08.940> one<00:04:08.970> one<00:04:09.810> CD

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:18.370 

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.729 

I<00:04:18.419> think<00:04:19.419> the<00:04:19.510> piece<00:04:19.690> needs<00:04:19.959> a<00:04:20.109> lot<00:04:20.260> of<00:04:20.290> energy

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:20.739 
I think the piece needs a lot of energy

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:23.700 
I think the piece needs a lot of energy
it's<00:04:21.579> also<00:04:21.790> for<00:04:22.030> conductor<00:04:22.570> not<00:04:23.020> so<00:04:23.199> easy<00:04:23.380> to

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:23.710 
it's also for conductor not so easy to

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:26.640 
it's also for conductor not so easy to
be<00:04:23.919> managing<00:04:24.699> the<00:04:25.060> organ<00:04:25.480> the<00:04:25.720> orchestra<00:04:26.500> the

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:26.650 
be managing the organ the orchestra the

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:30.240 
be managing the organ the orchestra the
choir<00:04:26.919> behind<00:04:27.190> you<00:04:27.760> a<00:04:28.030> soloist<00:04:28.900> it's<00:04:29.650> a<00:04:29.979> lot<00:04:30.160> of

00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:30.250 
choir behind you a soloist it's a lot of

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:31.980 
choir behind you a soloist it's a lot of
things<00:04:30.490> to<00:04:30.699> put<00:04:30.820> together<00:04:31.000> so<00:04:31.419> obviously<00:04:31.840> that

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:31.990 
things to put together so obviously that

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:34.800 
things to put together so obviously that
also<00:04:32.350> makes<00:04:32.650> me<00:04:32.830> a<00:04:32.860> little<00:04:33.100> bit<00:04:33.690> involved<00:04:34.690> in

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:34.810 
also makes me a little bit involved in

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:37.020 
also makes me a little bit involved in
song
