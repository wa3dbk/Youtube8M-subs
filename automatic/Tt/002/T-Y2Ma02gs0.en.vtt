00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.149
 let's go then with the images of 

00:00:02.199 --> 00:00:06.430
 this match back against saints 

00:00:04.149 --> 00:00:08.980
 In the Jalisco we had already been saying 

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:11.770
 draw favored those of the boss boy 

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:13.330
 we started like this just at minute 5 and 

00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:15.850
 we would see some team from behind 

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:17.980
 plugged in the shot is very good here 

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:19.449
 we had it the Chinese billiards average of 

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:21.640
 the court took the auction oswaldo 

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:23.109
 Sanchez very attentive and began to divert 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.689
 the ball in the first corner kick 

00:00:23.109 --> 00:00:27.970
 of the party that he himself billiards was going to 

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:29.499
 charge and attention because here headbut 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.599
 to exercise that rejected sanchez and 

00:00:29.499 --> 00:00:34.450
 after very good omar bravo was 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:36.460
 attentively they asked for goal others not of course 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:38.230
 the back team was celebrating 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.660
 immediate way ended up being a goal 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:43.630
 legitimate and it seems to me that without crossing 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:45.700
 completely the spherical ended 

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:47.920
 doing the 1 for 0 minute 15 already 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:49.570
 Then the team of 

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:51.310
 Saints 

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.680
 to take the reins of the party and 

00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:56.800
 renteria is the one that stays taking advantage 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:58.840
 a bad rejection of dry and there we have it 

00:00:56.800 --> 00:01:01.360
 then one by one I came to the 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:03.220
 minute 15 this already put the classification 

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:05.290
 in favor of the team of the region 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:07.300
 lagunera to see is a blunder 

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:09.310
 of erpen that ends up changing the course 

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:11.229
 of the party Miguel Angel Pinto puts the 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.930
 hand in a play golf outside 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:15.550
 area is red card direct very well 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:17.890
 sanctioned by the referee we see it a 

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:21.310
 Again he says I think he's wrong 

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:23.410
 as much of the defense as of pint more more 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.750
 It seems to me of the defense that I paint 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:28.119
 ends simply by avoiding the goal 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:30.610
 crossbar later in this shot from 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:32.740
 renterÃ­a took advantage of course to have 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:35.350
 a man over this team of 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:38.610
 saints we would see once again at least 252 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:41.050
 quintero for renteria and renteria good 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.550
 this man Alan Lopez who came in from 

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:46.539
 change after the exclusion of painted 

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:48.369
 was just debuting in the mx league and 

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:50.800
 as a professional in this contest and he and 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:51.540
 who was going to say 62 hot 

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.730
 now 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:56.820
 the one that could already very difficult things 

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:59.100
 for the team from the back a base 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.560
 to finish sealing Carlos Darwin 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.180
 Quintero at minute 63 a man who missed 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.970
 everything in the first leg but that in 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:09.390
 this second game in the match of 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:11.430
 back then simply keep the 

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.530
 he ends up converting two goals this one 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.300
 and the one who puts the last nail in the 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.420
 coffin for the team of saints and so on 

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:20.190
 we have the semifinalist who won 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.600
 back stays on the good road 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.810
 campaign in any way for the 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.810
 eyes
