system basically the concept here is we

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.060 
system basically the concept here is we
have<00:00:11.820> a<00:00:11.900> webcam<00:00:12.900> hooked<00:00:13.230> up<00:00:13.410> to<00:00:13.590> a<00:00:13.620> computer

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
have a webcam hooked up to a computer

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.680

that<00:00:14.340> perhaps<00:00:14.610> you're<00:00:14.880> not<00:00:15.000> using<00:00:15.240> maybe<00:00:15.540> you

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:15.690 
that perhaps you're not using maybe you

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:17.840 
that perhaps you're not using maybe you
are<00:00:15.839> using<00:00:16.109> and<00:00:16.410> of<00:00:16.980> course<00:00:17.220> computers<00:00:17.699> hooked

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
are using and of course computers hooked

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:19.970 
are using and of course computers hooked
up<00:00:18.090> to<00:00:18.210> the<00:00:18.330> Internet<00:00:18.720> and<00:00:18.930> it<00:00:19.470> utilizes

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
up to the Internet and it utilizes

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.570 
up to the Internet and it utilizes
Dropbox<00:00:20.789> to<00:00:21.510> save<00:00:21.779> recorded<00:00:22.410> footage<00:00:22.619> onto<00:00:23.550> a

Dropbox to save recorded footage onto a
remote<00:00:23.939> location<00:00:24.230> so<00:00:25.230> you<00:00:25.260> can<00:00:25.529> access<00:00:25.890> it

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
remote location so you can access it

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.670 
remote location so you can access it

detection<00:01:32.869> now<00:01:33.869> it<00:01:34.259> took<00:01:34.530> me<00:01:34.650> a<00:01:34.680> little<00:01:34.860> bit<00:01:35.100> of

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
detection now it took me a little bit of

detection now it took me a little bit of
playing<00:01:35.400> around<00:01:35.610> with<00:01:35.939> this<00:01:36.150> at<00:01:36.299> first<00:01:36.329> to<00:01:36.810> get

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:36.960 
playing around with this at first to get

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.929 
playing around with this at first to get
the<00:01:37.079> right<00:01:37.229> sensitivity<00:01:38.009> level<00:01:38.460> but<00:01:38.670> for<00:01:38.850> the

00:01:38.929 --> 00:01:38.939 
the right sensitivity level but for the

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:40.609 
the right sensitivity level but for the
most<00:01:39.060> part<00:01:39.210> I'll<00:01:39.720> just<00:01:40.140> stick<00:01:40.320> with<00:01:40.380> the

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:40.380 
if you don't know how Dropbox works

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.680 
if you don't know how Dropbox works
essentially<00:02:41.380> it's<00:02:41.650> a<00:02:41.770> folder<00:02:42.220> on<00:02:42.430> your

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:42.690 
essentially it's a folder on your

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:45.860 
essentially it's a folder on your
computer<00:02:43.690> that<00:02:43.900> synchronizes<00:02:44.620> with<00:02:45.190> the

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
computer that synchronizes with the

Dropbox server over on the distant end

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.870 
Dropbox server over on the distant end
of<00:02:49.210> the<00:02:49.660> Internet<00:02:50.080> and<00:02:50.560> you<00:02:51.190> can<00:02:51.340> access<00:02:51.550> that

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:51.880 
of the Internet and you can access that

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:53.910 
of the Internet and you can access that
folder<00:02:52.120> from<00:02:52.480> your<00:02:52.690> mobile<00:02:52.840> device<00:02:53.050> from

another<00:02:54.220> computer<00:02:54.820> from<00:02:55.330> whatever<00:02:55.570> pretty

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.050 
another computer from whatever pretty

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:58.740 
another computer from whatever pretty
much<00:02:56.230> so<00:02:57.100> I<00:02:57.130> just<00:02:57.460> created<00:02:57.910> a<00:02:58.090> custom<00:02:58.540> folder

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
much so I just created a custom folder

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:03.530 
much so I just created a custom folder
for<00:02:59.170> it<00:02:59.320> called<00:02:59.560> SECAM<00:03:00.160> and<00:03:00.990> I'll<00:03:01.990> go<00:03:02.140> okay<00:03:02.500> now

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
for it called SECAM and I'll go okay now

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.630 
for it called SECAM and I'll go okay now
the<00:03:04.540> cool<00:03:04.840> thing<00:03:05.050> about<00:03:05.080> iSpy<00:03:05.830> is<00:03:05.890> it<00:03:06.280> not<00:03:06.490> only

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:06.640 
the cool thing about iSpy is it not only

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.930 
the cool thing about iSpy is it not only
record<00:03:07.450> snapshots<00:03:08.290> and<00:03:08.590> thumbnails<00:03:09.190> of<00:03:09.490> it<00:03:09.640> so

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:09.940 
record snapshots and thumbnails of it so

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:11.640 
record snapshots and thumbnails of it so
you<00:03:10.030> can<00:03:10.330> easily<00:03:10.480> see<00:03:10.870> all<00:03:10.900> the<00:03:11.260> pictures<00:03:11.620> and

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
you can easily see all the pictures and

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.430 
you can easily see all the pictures and
stuff<00:03:11.860> but<00:03:12.280> it<00:03:12.430> also<00:03:12.610> records<00:03:13.210> about<00:03:13.870> 15

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:14.440 
stuff but it also records about 15

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:17.460 
stuff but it also records about 15
seconds<00:03:14.890> prior<00:03:15.220> to<00:03:15.900> motion<00:03:16.900> being<00:03:17.050> detected

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:17.470 
seconds prior to motion being detected

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:20.840 
seconds prior to motion being detected
and<00:03:17.860> 15<00:03:18.489> seconds<00:03:18.970> after<00:03:19.180> all<00:03:19.750> straight<00:03:20.440> video

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 
and 15 seconds after all straight video

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:25.080 
and 15 seconds after all straight video
so<00:03:21.850> if<00:03:22.150> we<00:03:22.270> take<00:03:22.420> a<00:03:22.480> look<00:03:22.690> and<00:03:23.670> another<00:03:24.670> thing<00:03:24.940> I

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
so if we take a look and another thing I

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:26.420 
so if we take a look and another thing I
got<00:03:25.239> going<00:03:25.270> on<00:03:25.690> here

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:26.430 
got going on here

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:29.520 
got going on here
take<00:03:27.430> a<00:03:27.459> look<00:03:27.670> at<00:03:27.790> Dropbox<00:03:28.090> I'm<00:03:28.780> moving<00:03:29.410> over

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:29.530

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:34.380 
take a look at Dropbox I'm moving over
to<00:03:29.890> see<00:03:30.489> cam<00:03:31.260> video<00:03:32.260> and<00:03:32.800> this<00:03:33.670> is<00:03:33.730> essentially

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:34.390 
to see cam video and this is essentially

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:38.310
