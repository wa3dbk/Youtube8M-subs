00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:03.870 
cracking here and I'm bringing one of

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:06.619 
cracking here and I'm bringing one of
the<00:00:04.110> best<00:00:04.410> spots<00:00:04.529> I<00:00:04.890> have<00:00:05.220> ever<00:00:05.460> seen<00:00:05.940> it<00:00:06.240> is

00:00:06.619 --> 00:00:06.629 
the best spots I have ever seen it is

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:09.049 
the best spots I have ever seen it is
called<00:00:06.810> runespan<00:00:07.170> v<00:00:07.500> 1.1<00:00:08.010> and<00:00:08.340> as<00:00:08.490> it<00:00:08.760> is<00:00:08.910> by

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
called runespan v 1.1 and as it is by

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:12.110 
called runespan v 1.1 and as it is by
round<00:00:09.389> ring<00:00:09.719> so<00:00:10.650> basically<00:00:11.130> it<00:00:11.550> just<00:00:11.610> plays

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
round ring so basically it just plays

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.720 
round ring so basically it just plays
data<00:00:12.420> Bruins<00:00:12.809> been<00:00:13.110> mini<00:00:14.009> game<00:00:14.190> for<00:00:14.429> you<00:00:14.549> so

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
data Bruins been mini game for you so

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.029 
data Bruins been mini game for you so
you<00:00:14.790> don't<00:00:14.849> have<00:00:15.059> to<00:00:15.389> and<00:00:15.900> it<00:00:16.109> brings<00:00:16.470> in<00:00:16.680> so

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
you don't have to and it brings in so

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:19.250 
you don't have to and it brings in so
much<00:00:17.310> runecrafting<00:00:17.760> XP<00:00:18.359> it's<00:00:18.570> unbelievable

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
much runecrafting XP it's unbelievable

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.730 
much runecrafting XP it's unbelievable
you<00:00:19.770> can<00:00:19.920> level<00:00:20.160> up<00:00:20.340> 1<00:00:20.760> to<00:00:20.970> 99<00:00:21.300> in<00:00:21.900> like<00:00:22.230> four

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
you can level up 1 to 99 in like four

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.769 
you can level up 1 to 99 in like four
days<00:00:22.769> to<00:00:23.369> spawning<00:00:23.640> this<00:00:23.880> and<00:00:24.150> it<00:00:24.269> is<00:00:24.420> like

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
days to spawning this and it is like

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.380 
days to spawning this and it is like
undetectable<00:00:25.470> it<00:00:25.710> does<00:00:26.490> audit<00:00:27.240> like

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:27.390 
undetectable it does audit like

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.750 
undetectable it does audit like
automatically<00:00:28.289> makes<00:00:29.160> you<00:00:29.340> look<00:00:29.519> like<00:00:29.699> a

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
automatically makes you look like a

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.429 
automatically makes you look like a
human<00:00:30.060> by<00:00:30.269> moving<00:00:30.510> around<00:00:30.929> by<00:00:31.170> checking

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
human by moving around by checking

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:33.319 
human by moving around by checking
levels<00:00:31.890> all<00:00:32.099> of<00:00:32.219> that<00:00:32.430> which<00:00:32.910> you'll<00:00:33.090> see<00:00:33.210> in

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
levels all of that which you'll see in

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:35.810 
levels all of that which you'll see in
the<00:00:33.510> video<00:00:33.800> so<00:00:34.800> basically<00:00:35.130> it<00:00:35.370> starts<00:00:35.460> off

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
the video so basically it starts off

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.000 
the video so basically it starts off
good<00:00:36.059> game<00:00:36.360> and<00:00:36.600> then<00:00:37.410> collects<00:00:37.739> enough

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
good game and then collects enough

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.590 
good game and then collects enough
person<00:00:38.370> still<00:00:38.579> you're<00:00:38.700> going<00:00:38.879> for<00:00:39.090> hours<00:00:39.360> so

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
person still you're going for hours so

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.180 
person still you're going for hours so
it<00:00:39.719> gets<00:00:39.809> about<00:00:40.050> a<00:00:40.110> hundred<00:00:40.350> or<00:00:40.680> so<00:00:40.710> off<00:00:40.980> s

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
it gets about a hundred or so off s

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.630 
it gets about a hundred or so off s
links<00:00:41.579> and<00:00:41.790> the<00:00:41.850> S<00:00:42.620> Cloud<00:00:43.620> thing<00:00:44.100> floating<00:00:44.430> uh

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
links and the S Cloud thing floating uh

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:45.830 
links and the S Cloud thing floating uh
since<00:00:44.879> they're<00:00:45.090> moved<00:00:45.390> over<00:00:45.570> those

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
since they're moved over those

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.680 
since they're moved over those
convenient<00:00:46.320> and<00:00:47.219> then<00:00:47.520> when<00:00:47.730> it<00:00:47.850> does<00:00:47.969> that<00:00:48.390> it

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
convenient and then when it does that it

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.690 
convenient and then when it does that it
goes<00:00:48.840> up<00:00:49.020> to<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.200> next<00:00:49.410> level<00:00:49.500> because<00:00:49.920> this

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
goes up to the next level because this

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.930 
goes up to the next level because this
isn't<00:00:51.090> free<00:00:51.660> to<00:00:51.780> play<00:00:51.899> but<00:00:52.370> it's<00:00:53.370> not<00:00:53.579> members

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
isn't free to play but it's not members

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.369 
isn't free to play but it's not members
just<00:00:54.180> yet<00:00:54.420> but<00:00:54.539> I'll<00:00:54.660> release<00:00:54.870> another<00:00:55.110> video

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
just yet but I'll release another video

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:57.560 
just yet but I'll release another video
on<00:00:55.469> that<00:00:55.500> loader<00:00:55.860> so<00:00:56.730> basically<00:00:57.090> goes<00:00:57.329> to<00:00:57.480> the

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
on that loader so basically goes to the

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.150 
on that loader so basically goes to the
middle<00:00:57.809> floor<00:00:58.050> as<00:00:58.289> you'll<00:00:58.530> see<00:00:58.559> to<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.070> bottom

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
middle floor as you'll see to the bottom

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:01.939 
middle floor as you'll see to the bottom
left<00:00:59.489> to<00:00:59.609> see<00:00:59.820> it<00:01:00.030> says<00:01:00.210> current<00:01:00.539> floor<00:01:00.899> I<00:01:01.649> will

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
left to see it says current floor I will

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:04.250 
left to see it says current floor I will
say<00:01:02.100> middle<00:01:02.460> for<00:01:02.910> and<00:01:03.149> they<00:01:03.719> don't<00:01:03.870> start

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260 
say middle for and they don't start

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:07.550 
say middle for and they don't start
automatically<00:01:05.630> siphoning<00:01:06.630> the<00:01:06.780> best<00:01:07.320> ones

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
automatically siphoning the best ones

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.890 
automatically siphoning the best ones
you<00:01:07.710> can<00:01:07.860> do<00:01:07.979> so<00:01:08.659> body<00:01:09.659> essence<00:01:10.200> or<00:01:11.479> all<00:01:12.479> that

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
you can do so body essence or all that

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.640 
you can do so body essence or all that
the<00:01:13.200> whatever<00:01:14.070> they're<00:01:14.220> called<00:01:14.430> and<00:01:15.360> then<00:01:16.080> you

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
the whatever they're called and then you

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.580 
the whatever they're called and then you
see<00:01:16.830> it<00:01:16.860> automatically<00:01:17.340> runs<00:01:17.820> up<00:01:17.939> the<00:01:17.970> bud<00:01:18.590> so

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
see it automatically runs up the bud so

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.289 
see it automatically runs up the bud so
this<00:01:19.860> can<00:01:20.009> get<00:01:20.100> you<00:01:20.220> so<00:01:20.430> many<00:01:20.520> points<00:01:20.970> free<00:01:21.210> to

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
this can get you so many points free to

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:22.730 
this can get you so many points free to
play<00:01:21.420> you<00:01:21.509> can't<00:01:21.810> spend<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.140> points<00:01:22.320> which<00:01:22.530> is
