double sided tape little piece of this
double-sided<00:03:28.720> tape<00:03:29.200> on<00:03:29.730> to<00:03:30.730> the<00:03:30.760> tonight's<00:03:31.240> a

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:34.410 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:38.440 

tiny<00:03:35.410> little<00:03:35.710> piece

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:44.010 

of<00:03:38.959> double-sided<00:03:39.950> tape<00:03:40.990> towards<00:03:42.250> SMD<00:03:43.250> LEDs

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:44.020 
of double-sided tape towards SMD LEDs

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:49.059 
of double-sided tape towards SMD LEDs
and<00:03:45.020> the<00:03:45.200> holding<00:03:46.989> so<00:03:47.989> I<00:03:48.020> hope<00:03:48.349> you<00:03:48.530> can<00:03:48.739> see<00:03:48.920> it

00:03:49.059 --> 00:03:49.069 
and the holding so I hope you can see it

00:03:49.069 --> 00:04:04.160 
and the holding so I hope you can see it
go<00:03:49.310> on<00:03:49.489> for<00:03:50.300> better<00:03:50.420> looking<00:03:50.870> at<00:03:52.300> SMD<00:03:53.300> LEDs

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:12.630 

put<00:04:04.710> them<00:04:04.980> in<00:04:05.010> the<00:04:05.310> ditch<00:04:05.460> light<00:04:05.730> housing

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:12.640 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:30.740 

so<00:04:13.270> smoothly<00:04:13.540> peaceful<00:04:14.880> other<00:04:15.880> sided<00:04:16.420> tape

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:30.750 

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:36.210 

so

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:36.220 

00:04:36.220 --> 00:04:39.570 

after<00:04:37.000> the<00:04:37.150> put<00:04:37.420> in<00:04:37.600> the<00:04:37.810> LED<00:04:38.050> mega<00:04:38.980> test<00:04:39.280> how

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:39.580 
after the put in the LED mega test how

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:46.970 
after the put in the LED mega test how
does<00:04:39.790> this<00:04:39.940> look

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:46.980 

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:56.670 

looks<00:04:47.580> nice<00:04:48.350> okay<00:04:49.350> the<00:04:49.920> other<00:04:49.950> one

00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:56.680 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:04.150 

bah

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:04.160 

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:07.270 

now<00:05:04.670> you<00:05:04.730> see<00:05:05.180> the<00:05:05.450> SMD<00:05:06.380> LED<00:05:06.740> in<00:05:06.980> the<00:05:07.010> diff

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:07.280 
now you see the SMD LED in the diff

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:11.380 
now you see the SMD LED in the diff
light<00:05:07.550> housing<00:05:08.030> and<00:05:09.730> it's<00:05:10.730> a<00:05:10.820> double-sided

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:11.390 
light housing and it's a double-sided

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:15.600 
light housing and it's a double-sided
tape

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:15.610 

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:30.630 

inside<00:05:16.450> we<00:05:17.200> hold<00:05:17.410> them<00:05:17.680> right<00:05:29.340> okay<00:05:30.340> on<00:05:30.490> the

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:30.640 
inside we hold them right okay on the

00:05:30.640 --> 00:06:16.089 
inside we hold them right okay on the
test<00:05:30.850> track<00:05:31.000> for<00:05:31.090> test

00:06:16.089 --> 00:06:16.099 

00:06:16.099 --> 00:06:20.269
