so<00:00:34.460> keep<00:00:35.329> that<00:00:35.359> in<00:00:35.569> mind<00:00:36.760> there's<00:00:37.760> how<00:00:38.030> we<00:00:38.089> have

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:38.690 
so keep that in mind there's how we have

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:42.969 
so keep that in mind there's how we have
our<00:00:38.870> roster<00:00:39.559> set<00:00:39.859> up<00:00:40.010> I<00:00:40.449> changed<00:00:41.979> the

00:00:42.969 --> 00:00:42.979 
our roster set up I changed the

00:00:42.979 --> 00:00:45.219 
our roster set up I changed the
receptions<00:00:43.760> the<00:00:44.210> reception's<00:00:44.690> is<00:00:44.839> one<00:00:45.019> like

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:45.229 
receptions the reception's is one like

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:47.949 
receptions the reception's is one like
normal<00:00:45.559> but<00:00:45.649> I<00:00:45.709> gave<00:00:45.920> rushing<00:00:46.309> attempts<00:00:46.959> point

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:47.959 
normal but I gave rushing attempts point

00:00:47.959 --> 00:00:52.209 
normal but I gave rushing attempts point
five<00:00:48.379> because<00:00:50.049> if<00:00:51.049> the<00:00:51.379> the<00:00:51.559> wide<00:00:51.799> receivers

00:00:52.209 --> 00:00:52.219 
five because if the the wide receivers

00:00:52.219 --> 00:00:54.069 
five because if the the wide receivers
didn't<00:00:52.399> become<00:00:52.609> a<00:00:52.639> little<00:00:52.909> bit<00:00:53.030> more<00:00:53.479> over

00:00:54.069 --> 00:00:54.079 
didn't become a little bit more over

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:55.899 
didn't become a little bit more over
power<00:00:54.289> than<00:00:54.619> the<00:00:54.739> running<00:00:55.010> backs<00:00:55.219> give<00:00:55.789> the

00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:55.909 
power than the running backs give the

00:00:55.909 --> 00:00:57.879 
power than the running backs give the
running<00:00:56.119> backs<00:00:56.269> point<00:00:56.659> five<00:00:56.929> it<00:00:57.350> kind<00:00:57.859> of

00:00:57.879 --> 00:00:57.889 
running backs point five it kind of

00:00:57.889 --> 00:01:00.069 
running backs point five it kind of
evens<00:00:58.039> it<00:00:58.279> up<00:00:58.369> a<00:00:58.489> little<00:00:58.609> bit<00:00:58.729> so<00:00:59.629> I<00:00:59.659> thought

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:00.079 
evens it up a little bit so I thought

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:01.660 
evens it up a little bit so I thought
that's<00:01:00.289> why<00:01:00.499> that's<00:01:00.829> what<00:01:00.979> I<00:01:01.010> came<00:01:01.100> to<00:01:01.279> a<00:01:01.459> final

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:01.670 
that's why that's what I came to a final

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.479 
that's why that's what I came to a final
conclusion<00:01:01.850> is<00:01:02.359> um<00:01:03.159> there's<00:01:04.159> all<00:01:04.369> the

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:04.489 
conclusion is um there's all the

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:06.010 
conclusion is um there's all the

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:13.610 
after the Houston defense just because I

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:15.900 
after the Houston defense just because I
thought<00:03:13.760> with<00:03:14.690> the<00:03:14.720> addition<00:03:15.140> to<00:03:15.230> ever<00:03:15.410> read

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 
thought with the addition to ever read

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:18.280 
thought with the addition to ever read
maybe<00:03:16.910> that<00:03:17.090> secondary<00:03:17.600> would<00:03:17.810> get<00:03:17.959> even

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
maybe that secondary would get even

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:21.099 
maybe that secondary would get even
better<00:03:18.440> and<00:03:18.769> I<00:03:19.640> believed<00:03:20.299> in<00:03:20.450> the<00:03:20.600> Houston

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:21.109 
better and I believed in the Houston

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:22.300 
better and I believed in the Houston
defense<00:03:21.440> I<00:03:21.650> think<00:03:21.920> they're<00:03:22.010> going<00:03:22.130> to<00:03:22.220> be

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:22.310 
defense I think they're going to be

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:25.840 
defense I think they're going to be
really<00:03:23.000> good<00:03:23.440> so<00:03:24.440> they're<00:03:24.980> my<00:03:25.370> choice

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:25.850 
really good so they're my choice
