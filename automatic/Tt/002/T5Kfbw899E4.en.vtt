00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:11.639
 the name is luiz fernando from ppe i am 

00:00:08.969 --> 00:00:12.990
 general manager of ong tech and works in 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:15.509
 company for four years 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:22.859
 bitec is a company originally from 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:26.189
 rapid prototyping and scanning 11 to 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:29.039
 3d printing is a technology here to 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:32.189
 obitec brought Brazil 18 years ago 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:34.559
 that allows you to build your piece 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:36.200
 customize your part through a 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.120
 fast-crossing point equipment 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:41.489
 without using media as a tool to 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.190
 production mode then it is an invoice 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:47.039
 additive or laser ne 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.110
 where you build layer by layer of 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:50.969
 order to have your final product 

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:52.590
 there are several materials that you can 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:53.670
 use in the application of prototyping 

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:55.800
 fast 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:58.140
 At first we have materials that 

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.859
 can simulate the famous propylene forum 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.590
 pp 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.980
 the abs or the nine itself there is also the 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.810
 technology you can build parts 

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:10.440
 two prototype with the metallic material 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.900
 titanium steel aluminum tool 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.310
 3d printing she has several advantages I 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.310
 I would tell you that the main advantage 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:19.890
 3d printing is customizing the 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.200
 product where you want what you wanted 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.760
 you apply your identity in the play and 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.370
 becomes reality 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:29.400
 transform it from your drawing to a 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:31.710
 then you quit massifying the 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.630
 production and has a production 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.550
 custom single 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.520
 According to your head this is already a 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:41.490
 trend or in the medical field today you 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:44.100
 have doctors who first make a 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.870
 surgery is you take resonance 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.780
 magnetic 

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:49.520
 example a choreography transfers a 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.760
 file that you can read 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:56.330
 3d between my skull case as before 

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:58.520
 you do surgery in the invasion to 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.870
 the preparation of the surgery you analyze is 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.030
 so big the person before the surgery 

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:04.820
 to study how a 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.350
 cutting and surgery planning and 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.750
 everything else you want to do prototypes 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.760
 already by more specific more technical 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.850
 such as this iron 

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:15.980
 that you can make the presentation of 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:17.330
 a marketing fair a presentation 

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.400
 with your company's board of directors 

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:21.110
 who wants to launch a new product that you 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.750
 makes the first prototype through 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:24.800
 3d printer and presents it in the 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.300
 what you want 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.760
 in a very realistic way as you can 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:31.430
 see here before launching all 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.730
 investment in that project here by 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.370
 me 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.860
 the option reveals began with this idea 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:39.470
 where you print a part to have a 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:42.170
 notion of how it would be but today it already exists 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:44.120
 a change of this trend already exist 

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:46.820
 cases of pieces that you print a 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.590
 printer and applies to the final product 

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:52.700
 we have a very interesting case and 

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:54.440
 of living today is real with embraer 

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:56.570
 who is a customer there is again from our 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:59.110
 we manufacture some printing parts 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:03.410
 3d are already applied in airplanes 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:06.590
 manufactured in the free print 3d has been 

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:08.900
 The more expensive the trend is the lower costs 

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.820
 in over the years with the improvement in 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:13.940
 speed in the productivity of 

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:16.430
 equipment and increasing the scale is the 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:18.890
 increase in consumption volume in brazil 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:21.950
 this here then the 3d printer 

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:24.860
 We 're going to pressure people you 

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:27.950
 even has a cost so power 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:30.560
 she has six thousand reais until 14m she does not 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:32.510
 can you work out a drawing? 

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:36.140
 I just want to say here or save the file 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:37.790
 stf after and raisin with pen drive a 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:39.709
 proclaimed here is software that 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:42.170
 convert already promised help to make 

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:44.450
 sad pressure I made him a party 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:47.390
 in a spiral it takes approximately 40 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:50.569
 minutes to produce 40 minutes then 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:52.280
 We are going to have a new part born of 

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:55.790
 any trip you can create 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:56.780
 because you want it and copy it send the 

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:59.440
 your wish 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:59.440
 your idea 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.550
 the clothes
