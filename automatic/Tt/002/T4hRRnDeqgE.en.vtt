so in conclusion Batman is better than

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:11.860 
so in conclusion Batman is better than
Superman<00:03:09.020> and<00:03:10.330> if<00:03:11.330> you<00:03:11.510> have<00:03:11.630> an<00:03:11.720> opinion

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:11.870 
Superman and if you have an opinion

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.230 
Superman and if you have an opinion
that's<00:03:12.230> otherwise<00:03:12.440> I<00:03:13.600> don't<00:03:14.600> care

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:15.240

that's otherwise I don't care
unless<00:03:15.840> that<00:03:15.870> opinion<00:03:16.260> is<00:03:16.380> that<00:03:16.410> suit<00:03:16.770> as<00:03:16.950> that

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:17.280 
unless that opinion is that suit as that

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.400 
unless that opinion is that suit as that
spider-man<00:03:17.640> is<00:03:17.910> better<00:03:18.090> than<00:03:18.240> both<00:03:18.420> because

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410 
spider-man is better than both because

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:21.680 
spider-man is better than both because
you<00:03:20.130> are<00:03:20.250> entitled<00:03:20.520> to<00:03:20.730> that<00:03:20.850> opinion<00:03:20.910> and<00:03:21.420> I
