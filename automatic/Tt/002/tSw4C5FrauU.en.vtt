00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:12.320 
is not the best flashlight in the world
this<00:02:10.170> is<00:02:10.319> not<00:02:10.470> a<00:02:10.500> flutter<00:02:10.920> this<00:02:11.760> doesn't<00:02:11.970> throw

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:12.330 
this is not a flutter this doesn't throw

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.980 
this is not a flutter this doesn't throw
very<00:02:12.360> far<00:02:12.680> but<00:02:13.680> for<00:02:14.280> up<00:02:14.459> close<00:02:14.569> you'll<00:02:15.569> be<00:02:15.720> just

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:15.990 
very far but for up close you'll be just

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.260 
very far but for up close you'll be just
fine<00:02:16.080> with<00:02:16.440> this<00:02:16.620> but<00:02:17.370> really<00:02:17.730> the<00:02:18.060> primary

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
fine with this but really the primary

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:23.270 
fine with this but really the primary
function<00:02:18.959> is<00:02:20.659> the<00:02:21.659> lantern<00:02:22.079> and<00:02:22.290> the<00:02:22.829> charging

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:23.280 
function is the lantern and the charging

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.270 
function is the lantern and the charging
going<00:02:23.879> back<00:02:24.090> to<00:02:24.329> the<00:02:24.480> front<00:02:24.780> yeah

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
going back to the front yeah

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.280 
going back to the front yeah
power<00:02:25.459> button<00:02:25.790> you<00:02:26.450> have<00:02:26.600> the<00:02:26.720> indicator<00:02:27.230> of

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.290 
power button you have the indicator of

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.559 
power button you have the indicator of
how<00:02:27.500> much<00:02:27.590> charge<00:02:27.860> is<00:02:27.980> left<00:02:28.400> going<00:02:29.209> around

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:29.569 
how much charge is left going around

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:32.199 
how much charge is left going around
yeah<00:02:30.290> the<00:02:30.470> micro<00:02:30.860> USB<00:02:31.340> connection<00:02:31.880> right<00:02:32.000> here

00:02:32.199 --> 00:02:32.209 
yeah the micro USB connection right here

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:34.720 
yeah the micro USB connection right here
that<00:02:32.390> charges<00:02:32.959> this<00:02:33.530> you<00:02:33.920> just<00:02:34.040> simply<00:02:34.340> plug

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:34.730 
that charges this you just simply plug

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.520 
that charges this you just simply plug
this<00:02:34.880> right<00:02:35.120> into<00:02:35.270> the<00:02:35.480> computer<00:02:35.870> and<00:02:35.990> it

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:36.530 
this right into the computer and it

00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:38.230 
this right into the computer and it
starts<00:02:36.800> charging<00:02:37.100> and<00:02:37.459> it<00:02:37.760> will<00:02:37.850> turn<00:02:38.030> off

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:38.240 
starts charging and it will turn off

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:41.080 
starts charging and it will turn off
when<00:02:38.630> it's<00:02:38.810> full<00:02:39.050> going<00:02:40.010> around<00:02:40.310> you<00:02:40.760> have<00:02:40.940> the

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:41.090 
when it's full going around you have the

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.449 
when it's full going around you have the
USB<00:02:41.450> out<00:02:41.870> so<00:02:42.380> you<00:02:42.440> can<00:02:42.620> connect<00:02:42.950> this<00:02:43.010> to<00:02:43.130> your

you can charge your device and also
comes<00:02:53.510> with<00:02:53.630> this<00:02:54.350> carabiner<00:02:55.250> right<00:02:55.520> here<00:02:55.760> of

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:56.060 
comes with this carabiner right here of

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.750 
comes with this carabiner right here of
course<00:02:56.720> this<00:02:57.080> is<00:02:57.230> not<00:02:57.260> for<00:02:57.650> climbing<00:02:57.830> but<00:02:58.610> this

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
course this is not for climbing but this

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.790 
course this is not for climbing but this
should<00:02:58.910> do<00:02:59.030> just<00:02:59.360> fine<00:02:59.480> if<00:02:59.930> you<00:03:00.440> want<00:03:00.620> to

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:00.800 
should do just fine if you want to

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.830 
should do just fine if you want to
attach<00:03:01.430> your<00:03:01.610> Lantern<00:03:01.910> and<00:03:02.060> then<00:03:02.300> attach<00:03:02.690> it

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
attach your Lantern and then attach it

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.180 
attach your Lantern and then attach it
to<00:03:02.900> your<00:03:02.959> pack<00:03:03.260> whatever<00:03:03.680> you<00:03:03.890> want<00:03:04.010> to<00:03:04.070> do

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:04.190 
to your pack whatever you want to do

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:06.520 
to your pack whatever you want to do
overall<00:03:05.150> this<00:03:05.510> is<00:03:05.690> not<00:03:05.870> very<00:03:06.110> heavy<00:03:06.290> this

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:06.530 
overall this is not very heavy this

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:09.040 
overall this is not very heavy this
comes<00:03:06.769> in<00:03:06.890> at<00:03:07.010> seven<00:03:07.340> point<00:03:07.580> four<00:03:07.820> ounces<00:03:08.360> so

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:09.050 
comes in at seven point four ounces so

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:11.259 
comes in at seven point four ounces so
there's<00:03:09.470> definitely<00:03:09.590> heavier<00:03:10.190> battery<00:03:11.000> banks

00:03:11.259 --> 00:03:11.269 
there's definitely heavier battery banks

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:13.509 
there's definitely heavier battery banks
out<00:03:11.390> there<00:03:11.569> but<00:03:11.780> there's<00:03:11.930> also<00:03:12.140> lighter<00:03:12.830> ones

00:03:13.509 --> 00:03:13.519 
out there but there's also lighter ones

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:15.430 
out there but there's also lighter ones
as<00:03:13.760> well<00:03:13.790> the<00:03:14.600> fact<00:03:14.840> that<00:03:14.930> this<00:03:15.080> is<00:03:15.230> dual

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
as well the fact that this is dual

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.220 
as well the fact that this is dual
purpose<00:03:15.830> charging<00:03:16.640> and<00:03:16.790> the<00:03:17.120> lantern<00:03:17.450> makes

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
purpose charging and the lantern makes

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:21.130 
purpose charging and the lantern makes
this<00:03:18.470> even<00:03:18.650> more<00:03:18.860> feasible<00:03:19.250> for<00:03:19.640> use<00:03:19.910> for<00:03:20.480> my

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
this even more feasible for use for my

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.320 
this even more feasible for use for my

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220 
take about four and a half hours now we

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.449 
take about four and a half hours now we
will<00:03:34.549> be<00:03:34.730> testing<00:03:35.090> that<00:03:35.209> out<00:03:35.450> as<00:03:35.750> we<00:03:36.650> go<00:03:36.980> along

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:37.459 
will be testing that out as we go along

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:41.550 
will be testing that out as we go along
the<00:03:38.090> lantern<00:03:38.510> by<00:03:39.350> itself<00:03:39.940> will<00:03:40.940> run<00:03:41.180> for<00:03:41.420> about

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:41.560 
the lantern by itself will run for about

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.250 
the lantern by itself will run for about
75<00:03:42.560> hours<00:03:42.860> straight<00:03:43.640> off<00:03:43.880> of<00:03:43.940> that<00:03:44.390> 7800

phones<00:03:50.900> multiple<00:03:51.890> times<00:03:52.250> I<00:03:52.640> was<00:03:52.880> doing<00:03:53.060> some

00:03:53.229 --> 00:03:53.239 
phones multiple times I was doing some

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:54.849 
phones multiple times I was doing some
research<00:03:53.269> on<00:03:53.720> this<00:03:53.900> and<00:03:54.049> one<00:03:54.380> individual

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:54.859 
research on this and one individual

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:56.830 
research on this and one individual
stated<00:03:55.220> that<00:03:55.310> they<00:03:55.489> were<00:03:55.519> able<00:03:55.850> to<00:03:56.090> recharge

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:56.840 
stated that they were able to recharge

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.890 
stated that they were able to recharge
their<00:03:57.140> galaxy<00:03:57.560> note<00:03:57.920> 2<00:03:58.329> almost<00:03:59.329> three<00:03:59.690> times

00:03:59.890 --> 00:03:59.900 
their galaxy note 2 almost three times

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:03.039 
their galaxy note 2 almost three times
so<00:04:00.650> that's<00:04:00.890> pretty<00:04:01.160> good<00:04:01.400> for<00:04:01.700> only<00:04:02.000> seven<00:04:02.660> and

00:04:03.039 --> 00:04:03.049 
so that's pretty good for only seven and

00:04:03.049 --> 00:04:05.949 
so that's pretty good for only seven and
