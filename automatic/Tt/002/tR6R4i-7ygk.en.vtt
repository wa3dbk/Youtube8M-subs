00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:19.680
 listen to a rather non-standard law 

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:22.020
 would I now to this material in general 

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.550
 I will talk about this tablet 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.980
 toshiba encore 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.960
 but first I want to tell the guys from 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.730
 Toshiba thank you for such detailed 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.099
 characteristics that few people have at all 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.399
 from manufacturers bothers to put 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.930
 next to the device but usually it is nobody 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:39.390
 does not do and here everything is clear to you now 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.540
 Iâ€™ll tell you clearly, so this is 8 7 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.000
 processor based device 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:47.190
 intel atom 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:51.440
 running windows 8.1 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:55.680
 that's all as usual, nothing unusual 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:56.309
 the resolution is 1280 by 800 pixels here 64 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.800
 gigabyte 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:01.020
 main memory for storing content and 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.469
 2 gigabytes of RAM for 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:06.090
 work u if different applications 

00:01:03.469 --> 00:01:10.230
 reported that this thing can 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:13.020
 work up to 7 hours without recharging 

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:13.560
 Here such a compact weighs not so 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.770
 lot 

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:19.410
 450 grams to keep comfortable while she 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:23.570
 thick enough but I can't say 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:26.520
 that it is terrible I personally do not chase for 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:28.320
 super subtlety in devices just to 

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.960
 they worked long enough on 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.610
 it turns out yes it turns out that this is the top 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.740
 butt and keep from the device you need here 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.490
 so vertical orientation so here on 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:40.620

 by the way a pretty rare thing for 

00:02:21.439 --> 00:02:25.400
 tablets because usually up 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.110

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.430
 there will be something interesting shoot well and about 

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:33.379
 the most important thing about how much 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:36.799

00:02:33.379 --> 00:02:39.590
