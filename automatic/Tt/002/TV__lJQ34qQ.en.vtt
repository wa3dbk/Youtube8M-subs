00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520
 I arrived on domaize there are two 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:08.580
 years with the goal of settling 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:11.700
 as a farmer I knew 

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:14.309
 not at all this region of cunlhat 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.049
 of aumetz saint diÃ© I had a shot of 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:18.990
 heart for this house but she had 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:22.140
 that 5 ha 5 ha it was enough for 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.880
 raise poultry so I do not have the 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.689
 status of farmer but leader 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.900
 operating 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:29.760
 the goal of the hen farm is 

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.910
 to make people discover that the 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:36.450
 poultry from one breed to another tastes 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:39.120
 different and I discovered over 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.340
 my personal meetings around 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:46.379
 poultry farming of breed poultry 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:48.059
 pure as the orpington so it has 

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:48.840
 been the reference poultry I had 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:51.449
 chosen at the beginning 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.620
 hence the name of the hen farm 

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:57.090
 redhead because it's big 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:59.250
 crowds false road receives us from 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.930
 groups of tourists but also 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:01.699
 schools of recreation centers 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.439
 groups of children 

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:05.880
 I explain to them what it is 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:07.530
 purebred the marans 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:10.680
 it's called the goose that lays the golden eggs 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:13.110
 it's this black hen lama and she 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:16.020
 lays wishes it very very bad food 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.750
 we looked at the children you have 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.750
 seen the difference a little color and 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.950
 here is a little chick gorges them 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.460
 then the children you will be able to 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.560
 hold 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.470
 so you put a hand under and a 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.210
 hand on I have in the parks to 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:33.030
 outdoors high in meadow poultry 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:36.570
 farmer that I raise there to kill and 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.430
 to sell and often so I can 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.689
 show people what are these 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:42.600
 crossovers and explain them the 

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:45.030
 strains that binds to two sous and so them 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:47.040
 they will discover if they come a 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.409
 once a month consume they go 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.170
 discover different flavors 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:54.990
 so there was that which was very 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.780
 important this culinary discovery 

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:58.960
 and then the second thing is the 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.210
 safeguard 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.500
 of the genetic heritage of our breeds 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:04.630
 local but it is absolutely necessary 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.580
 not lose otherwise all these crossings do not 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:09.640
 can no longer do them I use a 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:11.580
 huge bio because I think in 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:14.790
 my farming behavior as it is 

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:18.069
 it goes without saying what really is self-evident 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.930
 I could actually work 

00:02:18.069 --> 00:02:22.630
 with a person from the park in particular 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:26.670
 build wooden buildings from 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:30.640
 so that the public visit 

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:33.220
 cool what actually is really in 

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.050
 the target in alarm been fixed and then 

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:37.660
 with standards also opening of 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:39.760
 doors and then shelters in case of rain 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:41.290
 it's true that it was a hit and then 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.640
 the face lab that's called the 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.910
 killing where I actually slaughter my 

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.860
 poultry was one of the biggest 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:50.080
 investments 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.730
 it's you who carries the poultry not on 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:54.250
 comes regularly to the hen farm 

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:56.019
 redhead to see the animals and then we 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.910
 tasted several times different 

00:02:56.019 --> 00:02:59.260
 kinds of poultry so we do not hesitate 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:01.650
 to do a few small kilometers to 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:06.459
 to be able to eat quality poultry 

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:08.230
 with explanations on the races so 

00:03:06.459 --> 00:03:11.530
 we find small taste different to 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:12.670
 each time so different kinds of 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:14.380
 poultry and more kids love 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:16.840
 browse the park see the poultry 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.820
 alive and then feasting on returning 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.470
 at home 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:22.090
 lebouc yes you were right I have 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:23.620
 customers that there is now riom 

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:24.850
 and a little further because by 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.790
 chance on a Sunday they came in 

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:31.360
 family with children visit and 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:35.140
 here I become their address and in addition 

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:37.260
 when we taste then we will not 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:37.260
 elsewhere
