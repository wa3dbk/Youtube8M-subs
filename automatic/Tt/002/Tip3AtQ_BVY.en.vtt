avoid that and with each hit he gets

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.620 
avoid that and with each hit he gets
faster<00:01:34.860> and<00:01:34.890> faster<00:01:35.190> so<00:01:36.000> you'll<00:01:36.180> need<00:01:36.330> to<00:01:36.390> hit

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
faster and faster so you'll need to hit

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:45.730 
faster and faster so you'll need to hit
that<00:01:36.810> gym<00:01:36.990> quickly<00:01:37.470> to<00:01:37.619> finish<00:01:37.950> him<00:01:38.100> off
