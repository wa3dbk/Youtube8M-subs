and<00:00:43.829> stuff<00:00:43.950> and<00:00:44.129> he<00:00:44.190> may<00:00:44.340> do<00:00:44.489> that<00:00:44.670> and<00:00:44.969> the

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
and stuff and he may do that and the

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.000 
and stuff and he may do that and the
reason<00:00:45.780> why<00:00:46.020> I<00:00:46.050> think<00:00:46.469> this<00:00:46.590> is<00:00:46.710> one<00:00:46.860> of<00:00:46.890> the

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:47.010 
reason why I think this is one of the

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.590 
reason why I think this is one of the
best<00:00:47.190> hundred-plus<00:00:47.610> gameplays<00:00:48.090> and<00:00:48.120> YouTube

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
best hundred-plus gameplays and YouTube

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.869 
best hundred-plus gameplays and YouTube
you<00:00:49.020> probably<00:00:49.320> heard<00:00:50.070> up<00:00:50.309> from<00:00:50.550> this<00:00:50.670> table

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
you probably heard up from this table

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:53.180 
you probably heard up from this table
and<00:00:51.270> one<00:00:51.420> title<00:00:51.780> video<00:00:51.930> I<00:00:52.350> probably<00:00:52.739> titled

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
and one title video I probably titled

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.439 
and one title video I probably titled
the<00:00:53.280> best<00:00:53.489> on<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:53.730> +<00:00:53.969> key<00:00:54.000> and<00:00:54.239> play<00:00:54.390> or

00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
the best on the + key and play or

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.090 
the best on the + key and play or
something<00:00:54.719> like<00:00:54.780> that<00:00:54.840> and<00:00:55.590> the<00:00:55.739> reason<00:00:55.860> why<00:00:56.070> I

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
something like that and the reason why I

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.799 
something like that and the reason why I
do<00:00:56.250> think<00:00:56.640> is<00:00:56.730> because<00:00:57.059> it's<00:00:57.210> a<00:00:57.270> farce<00:00:57.510> key<00:00:57.690> and

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
do think is because it's a farce key and

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.260 
do think is because it's a farce key and
play<00:00:57.989> I'm<00:00:58.500> their<00:00:59.190> team<00:00:59.430> won<00:00:59.699> by<00:00:59.879> a<00:00:59.910> lot<00:01:00.120> more

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
play I'm their team won by a lot more

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.700 
play I'm their team won by a lot more
points<00:01:00.600> than<00:01:00.629> usual<00:01:00.960> if<00:01:01.320> you<00:01:01.530> see<00:01:01.680> a
