preview of it and basically you're
supposed<00:00:31.289> to<00:00:31.439> like<00:00:31.560> build<00:00:31.859> these<00:00:32.009> weapons

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
supposed to like build these weapons

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.790 
supposed to like build these weapons
that<00:00:32.700> kill<00:00:33.000> these<00:00:33.180> zombie<00:00:33.630> things<00:00:33.899> before

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
that kill these zombie things before

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.780 
that kill these zombie things before
they<00:00:34.890> get<00:00:35.070> to<00:00:35.250> the<00:00:35.309> big<00:00:35.579> generator<00:00:36.180> and<00:00:37.790> it

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
they get to the big generator and it

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.910 
they get to the big generator and it
like<00:00:39.149> if<00:00:39.540> you<00:00:39.780> exit<00:00:40.140> the<00:00:40.230> game<00:00:40.379> at<00:00:40.620> saves

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
like if you exit the game at saves

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.709 
like if you exit the game at saves
automatically<00:00:41.550> so<00:00:42.270> that's<00:00:42.450> a<00:00:42.570> good<00:00:42.660> thing

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
automatically so that's a good thing

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.819 
automatically so that's a good thing
about<00:00:42.989> it<00:00:43.579> that's<00:00:44.579> number<00:00:44.969> 10<00:00:45.149> number<00:00:45.420> 9<00:00:46.379> would

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
about it that's number 10 number 9 would

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.700 
about it that's number 10 number 9 would
have<00:00:46.980> to<00:00:47.100> be<00:00:47.219> gobble<00:00:47.670> Gators<00:00:48.059> it's<00:00:48.710> basically

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
have to be gobble Gators it's basically

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.850 
have to be gobble Gators it's basically
the<00:00:49.829> same<00:00:50.190> thing<00:00:50.250> as<00:00:50.700> Hungry<00:00:51.329> Hungry<00:00:51.480> Hippos

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:51.860

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
and then the winner I lost but that's

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.800 
and then the winner I lost but that's
because<00:01:08.549> I<00:01:08.760> don't<00:01:08.880> play<00:01:09.000> that<00:01:09.030> much<00:01:09.360> but

cars in the middle of the intersection

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.300 
cars in the middle of the intersection
here<00:01:38.610> and<00:01:39.470> I'll<00:01:40.470> show<00:01:40.500> you<00:01:40.650> what<00:01:40.799> happens<00:01:41.159> if
