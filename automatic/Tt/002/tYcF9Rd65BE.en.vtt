the<00:02:18.080> upper<00:02:18.380> register<00:02:18.709> of<00:02:18.800> the<00:02:18.860> base<00:02:19.040> that<00:02:19.550> you

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
the upper register of the base that you

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:22.150 
the upper register of the base that you
know<00:02:20.000> and<00:02:20.300> I<00:02:20.690> should<00:02:20.989> say<00:02:21.140> that<00:02:21.380> I<00:02:21.410> wouldn't

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:22.160 
know and I should say that I wouldn't

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:25.270 
know and I should say that I wouldn't
necessarily<00:02:22.580> be<00:02:23.680> playing<00:02:24.680> those<00:02:24.920> intervals

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
necessarily be playing those intervals

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.520 
necessarily be playing those intervals
so<00:02:25.400> I<00:02:25.459> enjoyed<00:02:26.209> that<00:02:26.300> really<00:02:26.810> writes<00:02:27.050> what<00:02:27.350> he

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:27.530 
so I enjoyed that really writes what he

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.340 
so I enjoyed that really writes what he
wants<00:02:28.010> to<00:02:28.130> hear<00:02:28.459> and<00:02:28.640> so<00:02:29.360> if<00:02:29.570> you<00:02:29.660> play<00:02:29.930> exactly

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.350 
wants to hear and so if you play exactly

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:33.310 
wants to hear and so if you play exactly
what<00:02:30.680> he<00:02:30.920> writes<00:02:31.370> you<00:02:32.330> can<00:02:32.540> really<00:02:32.780> get<00:02:32.989> into

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:33.320 
what he writes you can really get into

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:39.300 
what he writes you can really get into
that<00:02:33.470> style

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:39.310 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:42.120 

then<00:02:40.270> in<00:02:40.510> the<00:02:40.540> second<00:02:40.989> movement<00:02:41.140> the<00:02:41.680> trumpet

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.130 
then in the second movement the trumpet

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.670 
then in the second movement the trumpet
just<00:02:42.370> goes<00:02:42.880> a<00:02:42.910> little<00:02:43.180> it<00:02:43.510> shares<00:02:43.959> you<00:02:44.590> know

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
just goes a little it shares you know

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.410 
just goes a little it shares you know
equally<00:02:45.190> with<00:02:45.370> all<00:02:45.520> the<00:02:45.670> other<00:02:45.790> instruments

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.520 
equally with all the other instruments
and<00:02:46.630> in<00:02:46.750> a<00:02:46.989> kind<00:02:47.230> of<00:02:47.290> mysterious<00:02:47.849> lyrical

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:49.530 
and in a kind of mysterious lyrical

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:52.800 
and in a kind of mysterious lyrical
texture<00:02:50.610> there's<00:02:51.610> mysterious<00:02:52.180> because<00:02:52.599> there

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:52.810 
texture there's mysterious because there

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:56.190 
texture there's mysterious because there
are<00:02:54.270> there<00:02:55.270> really<00:02:55.569> is<00:02:55.630> kind<00:02:55.780> of<00:02:55.900> a<00:02:55.989> question

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:56.200 
are there really is kind of a question

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.229 
and as I looked at the score as i looked
at<00:03:08.019> my<00:03:08.140> part<00:03:08.530> I<00:03:08.800> was<00:03:09.160> really<00:03:09.550> trying<00:03:09.790> to<00:03:09.940> figure

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:10.239 
at my part I was really trying to figure

out and digest what were the colors of

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:13.800 
out and digest what were the colors of
the<00:03:12.430> pairings<00:03:12.850> of<00:03:13.030> the<00:03:13.150> moment<00:03:13.480> within<00:03:13.600> the
