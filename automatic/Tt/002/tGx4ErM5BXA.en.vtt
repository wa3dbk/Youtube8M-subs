 support us as you cook them 

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:53.110
 our pancakes so they bleed

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:22.600
 until all the dough will be 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:26.150
 logically finished we will go to see 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:30.410
 how many a pan or a pot like 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:32.180
 this may contain ok 

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:34.490
 when our pancakes will have 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:37.070

 placing the absorbent paper on them 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:02.710
 when the vast pancakes will have lost 

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:05.080
 the frying oil we transfer into a 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:07.300
