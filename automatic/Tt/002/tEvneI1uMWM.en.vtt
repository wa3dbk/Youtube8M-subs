first of all you can either disable it
or<00:00:59.800> there<00:01:00.800> is<00:01:00.920> activation<00:01:01.309> gestures<00:01:01.850> there

00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:02.449 
or there is activation gestures there

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:04.869 
or there is activation gestures there
swipes<00:01:02.840> and<00:01:03.140> you<00:01:04.100> can<00:01:04.250> figure<00:01:04.399> that<00:01:04.489> out<00:01:04.640> on

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:04.879 
swipes and you can figure that out on

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:06.639 
swipes and you can figure that out on
your<00:01:05.119> own<00:01:05.179> once<00:01:05.750> you<00:01:05.869> get<00:01:06.050> the<00:01:06.200> tweak<00:01:06.410> and

00:01:06.639 --> 00:01:06.649 
your own once you get the tweak and

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:09.130 
your own once you get the tweak and
there's<00:01:07.369> double<00:01:07.729> tap<00:01:08.030> double<00:01:08.840> tap<00:01:08.960> is

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:09.140 
there's double tap double tap is

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.160 
there's double tap double tap is
basically<00:01:09.649> instead<00:01:10.160> of<00:01:10.660> swiping<00:01:11.660> upward

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:12.170 
basically instead of swiping upward

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:14.410 
basically instead of swiping upward
right<00:01:12.289> here<00:01:12.560> you<00:01:13.280> double<00:01:13.700> tap<00:01:13.849> this<00:01:14.030> thing<00:01:14.090> and

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
right here you double tap this thing and

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.020 
right here you double tap this thing and
the<00:01:15.110> thing<00:01:15.140> comes<00:01:15.470> up<00:01:15.649> that's<00:01:16.160> for<00:01:16.369> say<00:01:16.970> you

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.030 
the thing comes up that's for say you

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:18.760 
the thing comes up that's for say you
have<00:01:17.209> another<00:01:17.390> tweak<00:01:17.690> running<00:01:17.990> like<00:01:18.200> atom<00:01:18.590> or

00:01:50.529 --> 00:01:50.539 
course you can keep it out for like I

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:52.270 
course you can keep it out for like I
just<00:01:50.599> showed<00:01:50.899> you<00:01:50.959> a<00:01:51.080> few<00:01:51.349> seconds<00:01:51.860> ago<00:01:51.920> or

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:52.280 
just showed you a few seconds ago or

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.330 
just showed you a few seconds ago or
minutes<00:01:52.610> and<00:01:53.890> finally<00:01:54.890> there's<00:01:55.099> background

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
minutes and finally there's background

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.100 
minutes and finally there's background
image<00:01:55.849> I<00:01:56.030> really<00:01:56.330> love<00:01:56.509> this<00:01:56.690> part<00:01:56.959> of<00:01:57.020> the

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:57.110 
image I really love this part of the

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.680 
image I really love this part of the
tweak<00:01:57.349> because<00:01:58.099> it<00:01:58.250> literally<00:01:58.640> allows<00:01:59.060> you<00:01:59.360> to

00:01:59.680 --> 00:01:59.690 
tweak because it literally allows you to

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:02.249 
tweak because it literally allows you to
go<00:02:00.050> into<00:02:00.170> custom<00:02:00.590> take<00:02:01.310> an<00:02:01.429> image<00:02:01.520> and

00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:02.259 
go into custom take an image and

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:04.479 
go into custom take an image and
basically<00:02:03.259> instead<00:02:03.979> of<00:02:04.069> having<00:02:04.340> that

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:04.489 
basically instead of having that

00:02:04.489 --> 00:02:06.790 
basically instead of having that
clearish<00:02:05.119> awesome<00:02:05.569> background<00:02:06.020> to<00:02:06.679> your

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:06.800 
clearish awesome background to your

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.100 
clearish awesome background to your
control<00:02:07.099> center<00:02:07.489> you<00:02:08.179> will<00:02:08.209> have<00:02:08.509> your<00:02:08.690> image

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
control center you will have your image

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:10.749 
control center you will have your image
in<00:02:09.289> the<00:02:09.410> background<00:02:09.440> which<00:02:10.099> looks<00:02:10.369> just<00:02:10.640> as

00:02:10.749 --> 00:02:10.759 
in the background which looks just as

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.750 
in the background which looks just as
cool<00:02:10.970> as<00:02:11.120> the<00:02:11.209> sky<00:02:11.650> but<00:02:12.650> yeah<00:02:13.129> in<00:02:13.340> any<00:02:13.520> case

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:13.760 
cool as the sky but yeah in any case

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.100 
cool as the sky but yeah in any case
