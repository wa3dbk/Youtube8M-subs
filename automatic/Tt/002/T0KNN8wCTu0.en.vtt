here<00:00:28.619> and<00:00:28.800> we've<00:00:29.730> got<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.240> unit<00:00:30.510> which<00:00:30.660> goes

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
here and we've got the unit which goes

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:32.659 
here and we've got the unit which goes
on<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.140> camera<00:00:31.500> this<00:00:31.800> is<00:00:31.920> what<00:00:32.099> triggers<00:00:32.579> to

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
on the camera this is what triggers to

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.120 
on the camera this is what triggers to
the<00:00:32.759> camera<00:00:33.090> and<00:00:33.410> this<00:00:34.410> is<00:00:34.680> the<00:00:34.890> remote

is radio-controlled like flash remote
controls<00:00:47.219> for<00:00:47.430> example<00:00:47.550> we've<00:00:48.360> got<00:00:48.390> a<00:00:48.600> set<00:00:48.960> of

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:49.010 
controls for example we've got a set of

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.069 
controls for example we've got a set of
four<00:00:50.010> small<00:00:50.219> switches<00:00:50.969> here<00:00:51.420> at<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.719> back<00:00:51.870> of

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
four small switches here at the back of

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.200 
four small switches here at the back of
the<00:00:52.289> units<00:00:52.680> and<00:00:52.860> you<00:00:53.430> have<00:00:53.550> to<00:00:53.670> set<00:00:53.879> the<00:00:54.000> same

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
the units and you have to set the same

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:57.200 
the units and you have to set the same
channel<00:00:54.719> of<00:00:54.840> course<00:00:55.079> for<00:00:55.440> both<00:00:55.620> units<00:00:56.399> to<00:00:56.789> make

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
channel of course for both units to make

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:00.049 
channel of course for both units to make
them<00:00:57.390> work<00:00:58.340> installation<00:00:59.340> is<00:00:59.430> quite<00:00:59.640> simple

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
them work installation is quite simple

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.869 
them work installation is quite simple
you<00:01:00.300> pop<00:01:00.809> the<00:01:01.109> remote<00:01:02.039> control<00:01:02.460> or<00:01:02.730> the

you pop the remote control or the

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:04.460 
you pop the remote control or the
transceiver<00:01:03.600> unit<00:01:03.899> here<00:01:04.110> the<00:01:04.170> reason

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470 
transceiver unit here the reason

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.850 
transceiver unit here the reason
receiving<00:01:05.430> unit<00:01:05.670> here<00:01:05.880> and<00:01:06.450> you<00:01:07.290> install<00:01:07.650> the

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
receiving unit here and you install the

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:14.420 
receiving unit here and you install the
cable<00:01:08.310> just<00:01:09.240> pop<00:01:09.510> it<00:01:09.630> in<00:01:09.750> here<00:01:12.350> yeah<00:01:13.350> switch<00:01:14.250> it

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
cable just pop it in here yeah switch it

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:18.890 
cable just pop it in here yeah switch it
on<00:01:14.580> and<00:01:15.210> that's<00:01:15.659> about<00:01:15.780> it<00:01:16.580> the<00:01:17.580> antenna<00:01:17.900> can

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
on and that's about it the antenna can

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.620 
on and that's about it the antenna can
be<00:01:18.960> extracted<00:01:19.590> if<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:20.640> range<00:01:21.060> doesn't<00:01:21.360> work

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
be extracted if the range doesn't work

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.130 
be extracted if the range doesn't work
and<00:01:22.549> it<00:01:23.549> is<00:01:23.700> short-range<00:01:24.240> here<00:01:24.509> you<00:01:24.840> can<00:01:24.990> also

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
and it is short-range here you can also

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.490 
and it is short-range here you can also
put<00:01:25.590> it<00:01:25.680> in<00:01:25.799> okay<00:01:26.840> operation<00:01:27.840> is<00:01:27.930> very<00:01:27.960> simple

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
put it in okay operation is very simple

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.950

that's<00:02:22.260> about<00:02:22.500> it<00:02:22.910> operation<00:02:23.910> is<00:02:24.000> quite

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
that's about it operation is quite

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.750 
that's about it operation is quite
simple<00:02:24.510> it<00:02:24.660> works<00:02:24.840> reliably<00:02:25.320> and<00:02:25.890> I<00:02:26.640> would

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
simple it works reliably and I would

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.760 
simple it works reliably and I would
like<00:02:26.940> to<00:02:27.090> sum<00:02:27.270> it<00:02:27.300> up<00:02:27.480> with<00:02:27.750> some<00:02:27.990> pluses<00:02:28.380> and

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
like to sum it up with some pluses and

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.520 
like to sum it up with some pluses and
minuses<00:02:29.310> on<00:02:30.030> the<00:02:30.150> plus<00:02:30.330> side<00:02:30.570> it<00:02:30.900> is<00:02:31.260> quite

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:31.530 
minuses on the plus side it is quite

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.090 
minuses on the plus side it is quite
cheap<00:02:32.000> it's<00:02:33.000> about<00:02:33.150> 32<00:02:33.600> euros<00:02:33.990> which<00:02:34.920> is<00:02:34.950> a

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:35.100 
cheap it's about 32 euros which is a

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:38.150 
cheap it's about 32 euros which is a
very<00:02:35.340> affordable<00:02:35.750> remote<00:02:36.750> control<00:02:37.170> unit<00:02:37.380> it's

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
very affordable remote control unit it's

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.210

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
doesn't stop the build quality is OK I

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.760 
doesn't stop the build quality is OK I
would<00:02:44.460> say<00:02:44.670> what<00:02:45.630> I<00:02:45.720> would<00:02:45.990> have<00:02:46.140> been<00:02:46.350> a

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
would say what I would have been a

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:49.850 
would say what I would have been a
little<00:02:47.730> bit<00:02:48.000> more<00:02:48.110> fun<00:02:49.110> love<00:02:49.320> would<00:02:49.500> have<00:02:49.530> been

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
little bit more fun love would have been

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:53.450 
little bit more fun love would have been
a<00:02:49.890> better<00:02:50.460> fit<00:02:50.910> here<00:02:51.330> it<00:02:52.170> doesn't<00:02:52.590> really<00:02:52.800> fit

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:53.460 
a better fit here it doesn't really fit

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:55.640 
a better fit here it doesn't really fit
very<00:02:53.700> tightly<00:02:53.790> on<00:02:54.300> the<00:02:54.330> hot<00:02:54.600> shoe<00:02:54.630> it<00:02:55.260> doesn't

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
very tightly on the hot shoe it doesn't

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.590 
very tightly on the hot shoe it doesn't
fall<00:02:55.890> off<00:02:55.920> when<00:02:56.340> you<00:02:56.490> use<00:02:56.730> it<00:02:56.910> so<00:02:57.150> that's<00:02:57.390> not<00:02:57.540> a

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:57.600 
fall off when you use it so that's not a

00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.930 
fall off when you use it so that's not a
problem<00:02:57.660> but<00:02:58.550> methods<00:02:59.550> the<00:02:59.670> thing<00:02:59.850> of

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940 
problem but methods the thing of

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.640 
problem but methods the thing of
personal<00:03:00.300> taste<00:03:00.540> I<00:03:00.690> would<00:03:00.720> have<00:03:00.930> liked<00:03:01.410> it<00:03:01.530> a

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
personal taste I would have liked it a

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.490 
personal taste I would have liked it a
little<00:03:01.800> bit<00:03:02.040> more<00:03:02.580> firmly<00:03:02.910> here<00:03:03.390> on<00:03:03.570> the<00:03:04.350> hot

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
little bit more firmly here on the hot

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.240 
little bit more firmly here on the hot
shoe<00:03:04.580> on<00:03:05.580> the<00:03:06.450> downside<00:03:06.900> we<00:03:07.350> have<00:03:07.710> two<00:03:08.130> issues

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:08.250 
shoe on the downside we have two issues

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.610 
shoe on the downside we have two issues
which<00:03:08.760> are<00:03:08.970> a<00:03:09.000> little<00:03:09.180> bit<00:03:09.420> annoying<00:03:09.690> first

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
which are a little bit annoying first

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:13.240 
which are a little bit annoying first
one<00:03:10.890> is<00:03:11.130> use<00:03:11.580> the<00:03:12.060> choice<00:03:12.270> of<00:03:12.480> the<00:03:12.600> batteries

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
one is use the choice of the batteries

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:17.030 
one is use the choice of the batteries
manufacturer<00:03:14.250> made<00:03:15.260> first<00:03:16.260> one<00:03:16.560> we<00:03:16.710> have<00:03:16.920> the

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:17.040 
manufacturer made first one we have the

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.850 
manufacturer made first one we have the
cr2<00:03:17.640> photo<00:03:18.030> battery<00:03:18.450> which<00:03:19.110> is<00:03:19.350> comparatively

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
cr2 photo battery which is comparatively

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.450 
cr2 photo battery which is comparatively
expensive<00:03:20.660> compared<00:03:21.660> to<00:03:22.020> triple-a<00:03:23.010> batteries

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:23.460 
expensive compared to triple-a batteries

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:26.450 
expensive compared to triple-a batteries
for<00:03:23.700> example<00:03:24.180> and<00:03:24.900> here<00:03:25.140> you<00:03:25.260> have<00:03:25.500> another<00:03:25.950> 12

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:26.460 
for example and here you have another 12

for example and here you have another 12
volt<00:03:26.700> battery<00:03:27.330> very<00:03:27.930> small<00:03:28.380> format<00:03:29.370> and<00:03:29.550> first

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:30.450 
volt battery very small format and first

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.320 
volt battery very small format and first
question<00:03:30.690> is<00:03:31.110> why<00:03:31.680> did<00:03:32.370> they<00:03:32.550> use<00:03:32.580> two

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:33.330 
question is why did they use two

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.810 
question is why did they use two
different<00:03:33.570> battery<00:03:34.440> formats<00:03:35.040> you<00:03:35.520> have<00:03:35.670> to

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820 
different battery formats you have to

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:38.600 
different battery formats you have to
always<00:03:36.240> have<00:03:36.420> two<00:03:37.050> different<00:03:37.230> batteries<00:03:37.830> as<00:03:38.550> a

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:38.610 
always have two different batteries as a

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:42.230 
always have two different batteries as a
spare<00:03:39.030> and<00:03:40.100> triple-a<00:03:41.130> is<00:03:41.459> used<00:03:41.790> for<00:03:42.120> other

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:42.240 
spare and triple-a is used for other

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:44.840 
spare and triple-a is used for other
radio<00:03:42.750> units<00:03:43.230> with<00:03:43.709> the<00:03:43.920> yongnuo

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
radio units with the yongnuo

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:48.860 
radio units with the yongnuo
RF<00:03:45.510> 603<00:03:46.470> I<00:03:46.500> think<00:03:47.160> they<00:03:47.310> are<00:03:47.490> they<00:03:48.390> use<00:03:48.570> triple

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
RF 603 I think they are they use triple

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:51.020 
RF 603 I think they are they use triple
A's<00:03:49.140> and<00:03:49.410> it<00:03:50.310> would<00:03:50.490> have<00:03:50.580> just<00:03:50.790> been<00:03:50.910> a

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:51.030 
A's and it would have just been a

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.150 
A's and it would have just been a
question<00:03:51.240> of<00:03:51.600> designing<00:03:52.290> this<00:03:52.410> case<00:03:52.709> a<00:03:52.740> little

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:53.160 
question of designing this case a little

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.580 
question of designing this case a little
bit<00:03:53.310> bigger<00:03:53.760> or<00:03:53.910> in<00:03:54.450> another<00:03:54.750> way<00:03:54.990> to<00:03:55.440> make

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590 
bit bigger or in another way to make

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.370 
bit bigger or in another way to make
other<00:03:55.830> batteries<00:03:56.340> fit<00:03:56.690> better<00:03:57.690> and<00:03:57.810> again<00:03:58.170> of

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
other batteries fit better and again of

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:00.560 
other batteries fit better and again of
course<00:03:58.890> this<00:03:59.070> is<00:03:59.250> a<00:03:59.280> 12-volt<00:03:59.790> battery<00:04:00.209> here

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:00.570 
course this is a 12-volt battery here

00:04:00.570 --> 00:04:03.699 
course this is a 12-volt battery here
this<00:04:01.080> one<00:04:01.290> is<00:04:01.320> to<00:04:02.130> read<00:04:02.310> it<00:04:02.490> I<00:04:02.700> don't<00:04:02.820> know<00:04:03.030> the

00:04:03.699 --> 00:04:03.709 
this one is to read it I don't know the

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:05.510 
this one is to read it I don't know the
three<00:04:04.709> volt<00:04:04.950> battery

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:05.520 
three volt battery

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:06.740 
three volt battery
perhaps<00:04:05.910> it's<00:04:06.209> the<00:04:06.330> thing<00:04:06.510> with<00:04:06.630> the

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:06.750 
perhaps it's the thing with the

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.180 
perhaps it's the thing with the
electronics<00:04:07.290> I'm<00:04:07.440> not<00:04:07.590> an<00:04:07.680> expert<00:04:08.010> on<00:04:08.130> that

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.190 
electronics I'm not an expert on that

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:10.280 
electronics I'm not an expert on that
but<00:04:08.880> this<00:04:09.270> would<00:04:09.450> have<00:04:09.630> been<00:04:09.840> a<00:04:09.870> little<00:04:10.170> bit

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:10.290 
but this would have been a little bit

00:04:10.290 --> 00:04:12.120 
but this would have been a little bit
better<00:04:10.440> if<00:04:11.040> we<00:04:11.610> have

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:12.130 
better if we have

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:15.480 
better if we have
same<00:04:12.490> type<00:04:12.730> of<00:04:12.880> battery<00:04:13.270> at<00:04:13.420> least<00:04:14.340> the<00:04:15.340> other

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:15.490 
same type of battery at least the other

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:17.880 
same type of battery at least the other
thing<00:04:15.790> which<00:04:16.000> is<00:04:16.030> quite<00:04:16.930> annoying<00:04:17.440> is<00:04:17.860> that

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:17.890 
thing which is quite annoying is that

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:20.040 
thing which is quite annoying is that
the<00:04:18.490> electronics<00:04:19.060> are<00:04:19.270> designed<00:04:19.630> in<00:04:19.780> such<00:04:19.990> a

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:20.050 
the electronics are designed in such a

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:22.860 
the electronics are designed in such a
way<00:04:20.320> that<00:04:20.350> even<00:04:20.890> if<00:04:21.430> they<00:04:21.810> equipment<00:04:22.810> is

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:22.870 
way that even if they equipment is

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:25.560 
way that even if they equipment is
switched<00:04:23.230> off<00:04:23.560> there<00:04:24.130> is<00:04:24.250> a<00:04:24.280> small<00:04:25.030> creepage

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:25.570 
switched off there is a small creepage

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:28.020 
switched off there is a small creepage
current<00:04:26.050> which<00:04:26.680> means<00:04:26.710> even<00:04:27.490> if<00:04:27.580> it's<00:04:27.760> not

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.030 
current which means even if it's not

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:30.630 
current which means even if it's not
used<00:04:28.360> there<00:04:28.750> is<00:04:28.840> always<00:04:29.140> a<00:04:29.170> little<00:04:29.640> current

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:30.640 
used there is always a little current

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:32.610 
used there is always a little current
leaping<00:04:31.150> through<00:04:31.420> the<00:04:31.720> electronics<00:04:32.410> and

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:32.620 
leaping through the electronics and

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:35.370 
leaping through the electronics and
drains<00:04:33.490> the<00:04:33.640> battery<00:04:33.760> so<00:04:34.690> the<00:04:34.870> first<00:04:35.110> time<00:04:35.350> I

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:35.380 
drains the battery so the first time I

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:38.010 
drains the battery so the first time I
used<00:04:35.680> them<00:04:35.890> everything<00:04:36.490> worked<00:04:36.760> fine<00:04:37.020> then

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:38.020 
used them everything worked fine then

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.440 
used them everything worked fine then
two<00:04:38.260> weeks<00:04:38.410> I<00:04:38.620> did<00:04:38.770> not<00:04:38.950> use<00:04:39.190> them<00:04:39.460> and<00:04:39.730> when<00:04:40.390> I

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:40.450 
two weeks I did not use them and when I

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:42.060 
two weeks I did not use them and when I
installed<00:04:40.870> them<00:04:41.080> again<00:04:41.470> I<00:04:41.500> wanted<00:04:41.860> to<00:04:41.950> use

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:42.070 
installed them again I wanted to use

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:44.310 
installed them again I wanted to use
them<00:04:42.250> it<00:04:42.370> didn't<00:04:42.610> work<00:04:42.790> and<00:04:43.060> until<00:04:44.020> I<00:04:44.050> found

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:44.320 
them it didn't work and until I found

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.530 
them it didn't work and until I found
out<00:04:44.500> that<00:04:44.650> it's<00:04:44.830> the<00:04:44.890> batteries<00:04:45.340> that's<00:04:45.790> quite

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:46.540 
out that it's the batteries that's quite

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:48.900 
out that it's the batteries that's quite
an<00:04:46.750> annoying<00:04:47.140> thing<00:04:47.440> of<00:04:48.280> course<00:04:48.550> I<00:04:48.640> switched

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:48.910 
an annoying thing of course I switched

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:51.000 
an annoying thing of course I switched
it<00:04:49.090> off<00:04:49.180> this<00:04:49.900> unit<00:04:50.230> here<00:04:50.410> has<00:04:50.560> an<00:04:50.680> on/off

it off this unit here has an on/off

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:52.860 
it off this unit here has an on/off

something<00:04:58.570> which<00:04:58.780> could<00:04:59.080> have<00:04:59.200> been<00:04:59.380> made

00:04:59.580 --> 00:04:59.590 
something which could have been made

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:01.890 
something which could have been made
better<00:04:59.860> perhaps<00:05:00.160> for<00:05:00.460> future<00:05:00.730> versions<00:05:01.150> but

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:01.900 
better perhaps for future versions but

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:03.870 
better perhaps for future versions but
to<00:05:02.200> wrap<00:05:02.380> it<00:05:02.530> up<00:05:02.650> it's<00:05:02.980> an<00:05:03.130> affordable<00:05:03.370> and

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:03.880 
to wrap it up it's an affordable and

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:07.650 
to wrap it up it's an affordable and
reliable<00:05:04.260> shutter<00:05:05.260> and<00:05:05.590> if<00:05:06.160> you<00:05:06.490> can<00:05:07.450> live

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:07.660 
reliable shutter and if you can live

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:09.230 
reliable shutter and if you can live
with<00:05:07.930> two<00:05:08.110> different<00:05:08.410> batteries<00:05:08.800> and

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:09.240 
with two different batteries and

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:11.460 
with two different batteries and
removing<00:05:10.240> the<00:05:10.330> batteries<00:05:10.720> after<00:05:10.930> it's<00:05:11.230> used

00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:11.470 
removing the batteries after it's used

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:13.500 
removing the batteries after it's used
to<00:05:11.680> prevent<00:05:12.010> them<00:05:12.280> from<00:05:12.460> draining<00:05:13.000> this<00:05:13.360> is<00:05:13.480> a

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:13.510 
to prevent them from draining this is a

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:15.960 
to prevent them from draining this is a
good<00:05:13.720> choice<00:05:13.900> for<00:05:13.960> you<00:05:14.490> hope<00:05:15.490> you<00:05:15.610> enjoyed<00:05:15.850> the

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:15.970 
good choice for you hope you enjoyed the
