far<00:00:47.309> it<00:00:47.399> hadn't<00:00:47.700> come<00:00:47.820> up<00:00:47.879> as<00:00:48.300> you<00:00:48.480> could<00:00:48.570> see

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
far it hadn't come up as you could see

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.400 
far it hadn't come up as you could see
real<00:00:49.590> quick<00:00:50.120> latency<00:00:51.120> jumped<00:00:51.510> up<00:00:51.629> from<00:00:51.660> 1,200

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
real quick latency jumped up from 1,200

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:55.990 
real quick latency jumped up from 1,200
to<00:00:52.440> 2400<00:00:53.690> it's<00:00:54.690> going<00:00:54.899> to<00:00:54.960> keep<00:00:55.110> climbing<00:00:55.620> as

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:56.000 
to 2400 it's going to keep climbing as

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.639 
to 2400 it's going to keep climbing as
we<00:00:57.000> move<00:00:57.180> along<00:00:57.329> this<00:00:57.629> video<00:00:57.960> I<00:00:58.020> think<00:00:58.379> it<00:00:58.500> gets

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
we move along this video I think it gets

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:05.690 
we move along this video I think it gets
up<00:00:58.829> to<00:00:58.859> 4,000<00:00:59.850> or<00:01:00.000> somewhere<00:01:04.339> go<00:01:05.339> and<00:01:05.549> check

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700 
up to 4,000 or somewhere go and check

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:07.820 
up to 4,000 or somewhere go and check
the<00:01:05.880> mailbox<00:01:06.090> real<00:01:06.570> quick<00:01:06.780> and<00:01:06.990> see<00:01:07.200> if<00:01:07.229> we<00:01:07.680> can

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
the mailbox real quick and see if we can

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.440 
the mailbox real quick and see if we can
pull<00:01:08.010> that<00:01:08.040> up<00:01:08.220> I<00:01:08.610> should<00:01:08.850> pull<00:01:09.060> up<00:01:09.210> without

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
pull that up I should pull up without

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.940 
pull that up I should pull up without
any<00:01:09.600> problems<00:01:10.170> it<00:01:10.439> does<00:01:12.439> let's<00:01:13.439> go<00:01:13.619> ahead<00:01:13.830> and

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:13.950 
any problems it does let's go ahead and

up as you can see I did click on it and
eventually<00:01:27.030> it<00:01:27.360> does<00:01:27.570> come<00:01:27.869> up<00:01:28.020> there<00:01:28.259> it<00:01:28.350> goes

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:29.420 
eventually it does come up there it goes

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.830 
4474 it's the latency I've got going
right<00:01:40.409> now<00:01:40.590> and<00:01:41.189> you<00:01:41.939> might<00:01:42.119> see<00:01:42.450> I've<00:01:42.630> got<00:01:42.659> a

right now and you might see I've got a

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.770 
right now and you might see I've got a
lot<00:01:43.110> of<00:01:43.140> addons<00:01:43.470> so<00:01:44.280> I've<00:01:44.729> been<00:01:44.970> told<00:01:45.030> you<00:01:45.659> no

lot of addons so I've been told you no

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.810 
lot of addons so I've been told you no
add-ons<00:01:46.049> can<00:01:46.470> slow<00:01:46.680> it<00:01:46.710> down<00:01:46.920> so<00:01:47.430> i'm<00:01:47.549> going<00:01:47.729> to

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
add-ons can slow it down so i'm going to

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.630 
add-ons can slow it down so i'm going to
log<00:01:48.030> out<00:01:48.470> jump<00:01:49.470> on<00:01:49.590> another<00:01:49.920> character<00:01:50.430> real

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
log out jump on another character real

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.840 
log out jump on another character real
quick<00:01:50.909> i<00:01:51.240> am<00:01:52.110> without<00:01:52.439> any<00:01:52.799> add-ons<00:01:53.009> loaded<00:01:53.610> as

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
quick i am without any add-ons loaded as

quick i am without any add-ons loaded as
you<00:01:54.060> can<00:01:54.149> see<00:01:54.270> my<00:01:54.390> latency<00:01:54.689> still<00:01:55.110> read<00:01:55.470> since

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 
you can see my latency still read since

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:02.270 
you can see my latency still read since
4062<00:01:58.610> so<00:01:59.610> no<00:02:00.210> real<00:02:00.570> improvement<00:02:01.200> I<00:02:01.439> just<00:02:02.100> see

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.069 
4062 so no real improvement I just see
how<00:02:02.369> long<00:02:02.579> it<00:02:02.759> took<00:02:02.939> for<00:02:03.000> thanks<00:02:03.360> Pelecanos

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
how long it took for thanks Pelecanos

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.590 
how long it took for thanks Pelecanos
and<00:02:04.619> not<00:02:04.860> quite<00:02:05.189> two<00:02:05.430> second<00:02:05.880> delay<00:02:05.909> but<00:02:06.390> I

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
and not quite two second delay but I

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.169 
and not quite two second delay but I
mean<00:02:07.020> if<00:02:07.110> I<00:02:07.200> was<00:02:07.229> trying<00:02:07.469> to<00:02:07.619> heal<00:02:07.829> somebody

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
mean if I was trying to heal somebody

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:11.300 
mean if I was trying to heal somebody
