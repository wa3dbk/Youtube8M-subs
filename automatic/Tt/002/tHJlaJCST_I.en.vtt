00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:23.340
 it was welcome but the video and the guy is 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.610
 some things on the internet the meeting does not 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.150
 can you believe 

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:28.150
 Joseph 

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:10.740
 it seems that some companies stay 

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:12.090
 wasting time writing things 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.429
 inverted in the mark 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.810
 because if it were true the company is 

00:01:14.429 --> 00:01:18.750
 getting lost in fucking time 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:21.750
 placing hello damon hello devil conjur 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.280
 devil and even in Japanese the problem of 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.079
 people is to always have the process of 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.090
 what makes them see 

00:01:25.079 --> 00:01:28.979
 things that do not exist and do 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.939
 themes such as conspiracy to become 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.189
 superfluous 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:34.170
 it is a means of reforming the clouds because our 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.369
 brain always rescues the references of 

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:37.259
 our mind 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.939
 subliminal advertising already has the 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:41.189
 purpose of persuading our 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:43.649
 subconscious the first experiment was 

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:46.470
 made in new jersey in 1976 by James 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.270
 I came to the movies during a movie he 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.630
 put the phrase drink cola with the 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:54.060
 time of 00 03 seconds of duration as 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:55.920
 our eye is only here for 0 2 seconds 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.569
 people did not see the phrase but 

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:59.759
 according to Jim Carrey and the messages 

00:01:57.569 --> 00:02:01.739
 recorded in the minds of people and 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:03.299
 during the interval of films 

00:02:01.739 --> 00:02:05.220
 soda brand sales 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.840
 increased by about 60% 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:09.090
 then he repeated his experience with 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.019
 message like popcorn and got the same 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.760
 result 

00:02:10.019 --> 00:02:13.380
 while the legal process of advertising 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.540
 subliminal approach is the use of 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:17.760
 such as using the color red for 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.799
 to influence hunger and the yellow color 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.690
 makes you eat faster and also 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:23.579
 subliminal advertising with many sounds 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.160
 their choice of heart as noise 

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:28.260
 many advertising backgrounds out there 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:30.359
 Of course there are some that do not have 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.400
 relationship no matter what 

00:02:30.359 --> 00:02:34.139
 that people look at but everyone knows 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.880
 that it's funny how you think the 

00:02:34.139 --> 00:02:38.100
 my smoking marijuana an advertisement 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.720
 I was about to slow that down from the most 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.239
 there are people who believe 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:53.609
 take a look in the comments was the be 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:55.620
 of braga but coming back here to you that 

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:57.239
 thinks that the subliminal 

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.549
 Sbt, a shit. 

00:02:57.239 --> 00:03:01.019
 that they are allowed 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:02.810
 according to the Conar that the national council 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:04.709
 advertising self-regulation 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:06.660
 said that this is not propaganda 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:08.519
 subliminal for the simple fact of not 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.440
 exceed the minimum collection time 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:12.120
 of the human eye but mean war it there 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:14.459
 is to keep passing the same advertisement 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.530
 When are you watching the good? 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:18.720
 there are advertisements that focus on 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.640
 events like I'm the football that 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:22.020
 shows clothing as protagonist 

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:23.910
 of a protester 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:25.560
 look and in some cases you can use the 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:27.240
 that's for you can use the song you 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:29.819
 can use the image that you can make 

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:31.530
 the voice that does not use the word does not work 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:33.060
 people are not stupid enough to 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:36.209
 drop some advertisement 

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:39.330
 Brazil is the country of football but also 

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:41.760
 It's the country of the holidays. 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:44.130
 so our fifa world cup 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.750
 It will be the best of all 

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:47.520
 some insist that our airports 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:50.220
 they will not notice 

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:53.070
 the traffic will be chaos and always 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:57.660
 say if you are like this now imagine in 

00:03:53.070 --> 00:03:59.489
 pessimistic cups always have a country that 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:02.940
 makes the greatest classics 

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:05.130
 the New Year and the carnival will make the 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.750
 best party ever seen 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:09.690
 let's imagine how airports 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:11.970
 will be crowded if they 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:13.019
 excited supporters and athletes 

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:14.700
 incredible 

00:04:13.019 --> 00:04:17.790
 let's imagine how we will have 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:19.410
 traffic jams in we will have trios 

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:24.090
 electrical 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:27.060
 brings a diversity imagine in brazil 

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:30.600
 Imagine that there is football going to have a plot 

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:33.420
 where the verdict erases drama remains 

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:35.160
 Imagine the party moderation error has some 

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:37.740
 which are pretty heavy as a farm 

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:40.760
 mtv and used masochism scenes during 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:40.760
 video frames 

00:05:03.129 --> 00:05:07.209
 but there are others who are thinking how 

00:05:05.439 --> 00:05:09.520
 the electoral campaign of the year 2000 and 

00:05:07.209 --> 00:05:11.709
 criticized its competitor and unintentionally 

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:14.229
 and he put the word rats on top of the 

00:05:11.709 --> 00:05:21.159
 phrase bureaucrats decide to open genius 

00:05:14.229 --> 00:05:24.879
 webex drug go go boy waterman for whom 

00:05:21.159 --> 00:05:32.019
 pull caught child death to 4 and in error 

00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:35.679
 with tightened by 5 to 1 and after having 

00:05:32.019 --> 00:05:37.300
 had access here tie is from the movie 

00:05:35.679 --> 00:05:38.979
 silence of the unconscious 

00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:40.719
 on the movie poster you can see a 

00:05:38.979 --> 00:05:42.399
 skull on a butterfly 

00:05:40.719 --> 00:05:44.589
 So much so, but if we look 

00:05:42.399 --> 00:05:46.659
 carefully in the skull we see about 

00:05:44.589 --> 00:05:48.909
 seven women and before you say that 

00:05:46.659 --> 00:05:51.009
 I'm going crazy and seven bodies are 

00:05:48.909 --> 00:05:53.709
 a work of Salvador DalÃ­ that is called 

00:05:51.009 --> 00:05:55.689
 human skull but abel no leaving that 

00:05:53.709 --> 00:05:59.439
 just do this thinking 

00:05:55.689 --> 00:06:20.949
 these manifested an absurdity I hold 

00:05:59.439 --> 00:06:28.179
 psychologist and technologist you are very far 

00:06:20.949 --> 00:06:29.619
