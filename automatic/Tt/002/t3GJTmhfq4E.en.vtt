that I tried dry brushing and black the

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:41.390 
that I tried dry brushing and black the
way<00:01:39.299> you<00:01:39.360> do<00:01:39.600> it<00:01:39.720> is<00:01:39.840> you<00:01:39.869> apply<00:01:40.439> just<00:01:40.829> a<00:01:41.009> little

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
way you do it is you apply just a little

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.819 
way you do it is you apply just a little
bit<00:01:41.579> of<00:01:41.700> paint<00:01:41.939> to<00:01:42.150> your<00:01:42.240> brush<00:01:42.450> and<00:01:42.750> just<00:01:43.560> wipe

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
bit of paint to your brush and just wipe

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:46.010 
bit of paint to your brush and just wipe
it<00:01:44.009> all<00:01:44.189> away<00:01:44.220> until<00:01:44.850> you<00:01:45.000> got<00:01:45.119> very<00:01:45.390> dry

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
it all away until you got very dry

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.569 
it all away until you got very dry
strokes<00:01:46.649> of<00:01:47.040> paint<00:01:47.119> or<00:01:48.140> dry<00:01:49.250> brush<00:01:50.250> strokes

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
strokes of paint or dry brush strokes

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.060 
strokes of paint or dry brush strokes
and<00:01:50.820> that's<00:01:51.659> why<00:01:51.810> they<00:01:51.990> call<00:01:52.170> it<00:01:52.200> dry<00:01:52.470> brushing

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070

in<00:01:58.380> the<00:01:58.469> front<00:01:58.770> right<00:01:58.920> here<00:01:58.979> they're<00:01:59.759> actually

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
in the front right here they're actually

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.149 
in the front right here they're actually
on<00:02:00.479> their<00:02:00.810> respective<00:02:01.350> halves

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159 
on their respective halves

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:04.459 
on their respective halves
so<00:02:02.340> this<00:02:02.579> LED<00:02:03.030> is<00:02:03.119> on<00:02:03.149> the<00:02:03.390> left<00:02:03.600> and<00:02:03.899> this<00:02:04.259> one

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
so this LED is on the left and this one

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.590 
so this LED is on the left and this one
maybe<00:02:04.920> it's<00:02:05.040> easier<00:02:05.159> for<00:02:05.310> you<00:02:05.579> it's<00:02:06.329> that<00:02:06.450> easy

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
maybe it's easier for you it's that easy

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.190 
maybe it's easier for you it's that easy
for<00:02:06.780> you<00:02:06.960> guys<00:02:07.020> to<00:02:07.290> see<00:02:07.469> no<00:02:08.429> I<00:02:08.459> don't<00:02:08.550> think<00:02:08.700> so

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
for you guys to see no I don't think so

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.220 
for you guys to see no I don't think so
okay<00:02:09.770> so<00:02:09.830> there's<00:02:10.429> one<00:02:10.700> led<00:02:11.120> on<00:02:11.330> this<00:02:11.720> side<00:02:12.020> the

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:12.230 
okay so there's one led on this side the

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:14.020 
okay so there's one led on this side the
left<00:02:12.470> side<00:02:12.650> and<00:02:12.950> then<00:02:13.280> one<00:02:13.489> on<00:02:13.610> the<00:02:13.700> right<00:02:14.000> side

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
left side and then one on the right side

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.199 
left side and then one on the right side
and<00:02:14.630> the<00:02:15.560> reason<00:02:15.920> behind<00:02:16.099> that<00:02:16.400> is<00:02:16.550> if<00:02:17.060> you've

00:02:17.199 --> 00:02:17.209 
and the reason behind that is if you've

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:19.120 
and the reason behind that is if you've
seen<00:02:17.480> my<00:02:17.630> other<00:02:17.660> video<00:02:18.260> which<00:02:18.470> is<00:02:18.650> just<00:02:18.890> all

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
seen my other video which is just all

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:20.589 
seen my other video which is just all
the<00:02:19.280> pictures<00:02:19.640> showing<00:02:19.970> you<00:02:20.030> how<00:02:20.180> I<00:02:20.239> did<00:02:20.390> it

00:02:20.589 --> 00:02:20.599 
the pictures showing you how I did it

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:23.620 
the pictures showing you how I did it
you<00:02:21.200> can<00:02:21.230> actually<00:02:21.590> take<00:02:22.370> it<00:02:22.580> apart<00:02:22.910> and<00:02:23.090> split

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
you can actually take it apart and split

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:25.449 
you can actually take it apart and split
the<00:02:23.780> shell<00:02:23.989> into<00:02:24.200> half<00:02:24.470> so<00:02:24.500> it's<00:02:24.920> really<00:02:25.250> easy

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:25.459 
the shell into half so it's really easy

00:02:25.459 --> 00:02:28.750 
the shell into half so it's really easy
for<00:02:25.610> maintenance<00:02:26.200> what<00:02:27.200> I<00:02:27.230> did<00:02:27.500> was<00:02:27.680> I<00:02:27.980> drilled

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:28.760 
for maintenance what I did was I drilled

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.660 
for maintenance what I did was I drilled
two<00:02:29.239> holes<00:02:29.270> right<00:02:29.870> here<00:02:29.950> not<00:02:30.950> holes<00:02:31.340> big

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
two holes right here not holes big

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.460 
two holes right here not holes big
enough<00:02:31.700> so<00:02:32.180> that<00:02:32.209> the<00:02:32.510> LEDs<00:02:32.959> would<00:02:33.110> actually

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.470 
enough so that the LEDs would actually

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:36.009 
enough so that the LEDs would actually
go<00:02:33.680> into<00:02:33.950> the<00:02:34.250> gun<00:02:34.400> so<00:02:35.180> what<00:02:35.360> I<00:02:35.390> did<00:02:35.510> was<00:02:35.810> that<00:02:35.840> I

00:02:36.009 --> 00:02:36.019 
go into the gun so what I did was that I

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:38.830 
go into the gun so what I did was that I
wired<00:02:36.260> it<00:02:36.440> to<00:02:36.680> a<00:02:36.709> 9-volt<00:02:37.430> battery<00:02:38.180> in<00:02:38.420> the

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:38.840 
wired it to a 9-volt battery in the

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.800 
wired it to a 9-volt battery in the
handle<00:02:39.590> and<00:02:39.940> then<00:02:40.940> I<00:02:41.209> actually<00:02:41.540> put<00:02:41.690> the

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
handle and then I actually put the

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.229 
handle and then I actually put the
switch<00:02:42.110> on<00:02:42.290> the<00:02:42.319> bottom<00:02:42.590> the<00:02:43.370> switch<00:02:43.730> actually

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:44.239 
switch on the bottom the switch actually

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:47.110 
switch on the bottom the switch actually
went<00:02:44.510> in<00:02:44.630> very<00:02:45.080> neatly<00:02:45.440> it<00:02:46.340> was<00:02:46.580> actually<00:02:46.910> just

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:47.120 
went in very neatly it was actually just

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.180 
went in very neatly it was actually just
hot<00:02:47.299> glued<00:02:47.690> from<00:02:48.049> the<00:02:48.170> inside<00:02:48.620> and<00:02:48.860> it<00:02:48.980> goes

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:49.190 
hot glued from the inside and it goes

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.940 
hot glued from the inside and it goes
into<00:02:49.430> this<00:02:49.670> little<00:02:50.000> dark<00:02:50.360> dark<00:02:51.319> holder<00:02:51.769> or

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
into this little dark dark holder or

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:53.380 
into this little dark dark holder or
whatever<00:02:52.220> you<00:02:52.310> call<00:02:52.489> it<00:02:52.519> the<00:02:52.730> useless<00:02:53.120> little

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 
whatever you call it the useless little

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:55.270 
whatever you call it the useless little
thing<00:02:53.600> where<00:02:53.750> you<00:02:53.810> could<00:02:53.900> stick<00:02:54.230> a<00:02:54.260> dart<00:02:54.590> even

00:02:55.270 --> 00:02:55.280 
thing where you could stick a dart even

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.850 
thing where you could stick a dart even
though<00:02:55.370> you<00:02:55.430> use<00:02:55.610> a<00:02:55.640> clip<00:02:56.030> fed<00:02:56.299> gun<00:02:56.860> they

00:02:57.850 --> 00:02:57.860 
though you use a clip fed gun they

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:00.699 
though you use a clip fed gun they
weren't<00:02:58.160> supposed<00:02:58.310> to<00:02:58.640> look<00:02:59.030> or<00:02:59.709> illuminate

00:03:00.699 --> 00:03:00.709 
weren't supposed to look or illuminate

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:03.400 
weren't supposed to look or illuminate
the<00:03:01.069> dark<00:03:01.400> if<00:03:01.940> I<00:03:02.360> wanted<00:03:02.690> to<00:03:02.750> illuminate<00:03:03.290> the

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410 
the dark if I wanted to illuminate the

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:07.140 
the dark if I wanted to illuminate the
dark<00:03:03.650> I<00:03:03.769> would<00:03:03.890> just<00:03:04.040> put<00:03:04.220> a<00:03:04.660> like<00:03:05.660> a<00:03:05.690> 50-pound

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.150 
dark I would just put a like a 50-pound

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.970 
dark I would just put a like a 50-pound
3,000<00:03:08.150> lumen<00:03:08.569> flashlight<00:03:09.200> on<00:03:09.350> the<00:03:09.500> top<00:03:09.709> and

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980 
3,000 lumen flashlight on the top and

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.580 
3,000 lumen flashlight on the top and
that<00:03:10.069> would<00:03:10.220> have<00:03:10.370> been<00:03:10.489> fun<00:03:11.110> people<00:03:12.110> also

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:12.590 
that would have been fun people also

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:15.610 
that would have been fun people also
complained<00:03:13.160> but<00:03:13.730> not<00:03:13.880> complained<00:03:14.450> I<00:03:14.780> mean<00:03:15.079> but

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:15.620 
complained but not complained I mean but

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.550 
complained but not complained I mean but
they<00:03:15.769> had<00:03:16.010> some<00:03:16.459> critiques<00:03:17.329> and<00:03:17.630> I<00:03:18.019> totally

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:18.560 
they had some critiques and I totally

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:19.569 
they had some critiques and I totally
get<00:03:18.769> those<00:03:18.950> critiques

00:03:19.569 --> 00:03:19.579 
get those critiques

00:03:19.579 --> 00:03:22.360 
get those critiques
these<00:03:20.120> LEDs<00:03:20.660> aren't<00:03:21.019> very<00:03:21.200> bright<00:03:21.470> but<00:03:22.250> they

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:22.370 
these LEDs aren't very bright but they

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:24.970 
these LEDs aren't very bright but they
do<00:03:22.430> look<00:03:22.970> really<00:03:23.209> cool<00:03:23.600> and<00:03:23.930> if<00:03:24.500> I<00:03:24.620> really

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:24.980 
do look really cool and if I really

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:26.770 
do look really cool and if I really
wanted<00:03:25.340> to<00:03:25.400> light<00:03:25.670> something<00:03:25.970> up<00:03:26.269> as<00:03:26.480> I<00:03:26.630> said

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
wanted to light something up as I said

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:28.509 
wanted to light something up as I said
I'll<00:03:26.930> just<00:03:26.959> put<00:03:27.290> a<00:03:27.320> flashlight<00:03:27.590> on<00:03:27.829> top<00:03:28.190> I<00:03:28.400> know

00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:28.519 
I'll just put a flashlight on top I know

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:33.340 
I'll just put a flashlight on top I know
that<00:03:29.410> but<00:03:30.410> I<00:03:30.760> put<00:03:31.760> these<00:03:31.880> LEDs<00:03:32.390> just<00:03:32.750> because

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:33.350 
that but I put these LEDs just because

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:35.770 
that but I put these LEDs just because
putting<00:03:34.250> a<00:03:34.340> flashlight<00:03:34.670> that's<00:03:35.030> boring<00:03:35.600> and

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
putting a flashlight that's boring and

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:39.280 
putting a flashlight that's boring and
you<00:03:36.350> can't<00:03:36.560> get<00:03:36.650> a<00:03:36.709> red<00:03:36.950> flashlight<00:03:37.720> so<00:03:38.720> I<00:03:39.109> just

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:39.290 
you can't get a red flashlight so I just

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:41.740 
you can't get a red flashlight so I just
put<00:03:39.470> the<00:03:39.590> LEDs<00:03:40.070> because<00:03:40.670> they<00:03:40.940> look<00:03:41.120> cool<00:03:41.359> and

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:41.750 
put the LEDs because they look cool and

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:43.840 
put the LEDs because they look cool and
I<00:03:42.170> realized<00:03:42.500> you<00:03:42.620> got<00:03:42.829> guys<00:03:43.130> can't<00:03:43.489> see<00:03:43.730> how

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:43.850 
I realized you got guys can't see how

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:45.819 
I realized you got guys can't see how
awesome<00:03:44.390> it<00:03:44.510> looks<00:03:44.540> in<00:03:44.959> real<00:03:45.109> life<00:03:45.350> but<00:03:45.650> these

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:45.829 
awesome it looks in real life but these

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:49.599 
awesome it looks in real life but these
red<00:03:46.190> LEDs<00:03:46.760> really<00:03:47.230> make<00:03:48.230> it<00:03:48.260> look<00:03:48.500> cooler<00:03:49.190> on
