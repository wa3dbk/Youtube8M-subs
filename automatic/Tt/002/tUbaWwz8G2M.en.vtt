00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210 
ankle exposed they should have probably

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:50.899 
ankle exposed they should have probably
left<00:01:48.600> like<00:01:48.810> maybe<00:01:49.049> like<00:01:49.710> a<00:01:49.770> herati<00:01:50.250> material

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:50.909

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.310 
left like maybe like a herati material
there<00:01:51.119> or<00:01:51.360> they<00:01:51.479> should<00:01:51.689> have<00:01:51.780> kept<00:01:52.020> something

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
there or they should have kept something

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.530 
there or they should have kept something
maybe<00:01:53.070> they<00:01:53.220> should<00:01:53.399> just<00:01:53.430> kept<00:01:53.850> the<00:01:54.030> material

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
maybe they should just kept the material

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:55.969 
maybe they should just kept the material
there<00:01:54.720> I<00:01:54.899> don't<00:01:55.439> know<00:01:55.500> they<00:01:55.649> should<00:01:55.829> have<00:01:55.950> done

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
there I don't know they should have done

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.940 
there I don't know they should have done
something<00:01:56.960> which<00:01:57.960> would<00:01:58.200> have<00:01:58.350> cut<00:01:58.590> out<00:01:58.710> one

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
something which would have cut out one

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:01.969 
something which would have cut out one
of<00:01:58.979> the<00:01:59.159> steps<00:01:59.460> to<00:02:00.420> put<00:02:00.899> this<00:02:01.079> shoe<00:02:01.320> on<00:02:01.530> because

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
of the steps to put this shoe on because

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.870 
of the steps to put this shoe on because
it<00:02:02.130> was<00:02:02.460> a<00:02:02.490> hassle<00:02:02.969> and<00:02:04.100> you<00:02:05.100> know<00:02:05.250> it's<00:02:05.520> it's<00:02:05.759> a

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
it was a hassle and you know it's it's a

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.520 
it was a hassle and you know it's it's a
shame<00:02:06.090> because<00:02:06.240> it's<00:02:06.570> definitely<00:02:07.320> a<00:02:07.350> nice

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530 
shame because it's definitely a nice

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.949 
shame because it's definitely a nice
looking<00:02:07.860> shoe<00:02:08.129> arm<00:02:08.539> maybe<00:02:09.539> they<00:02:09.690> could<00:02:09.869> have

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
looking shoe arm maybe they could have

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.720 
looking shoe arm maybe they could have
done<00:02:10.110> something<00:02:10.349> with<00:02:10.590> the<00:02:10.800> mid-foot<00:02:11.430> strap

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
done something with the mid-foot strap

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.580 
done something with the mid-foot strap
as<00:02:11.910> well<00:02:11.940> instead<00:02:12.330> of<00:02:12.569> having<00:02:12.870> that

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590 
as well instead of having that

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:16.520 
as well instead of having that
as<00:02:13.879> you<00:02:14.879> know<00:02:15.000> I'm<00:02:15.269> a<00:02:15.330> mid-foot<00:02:16.050> strap<00:02:16.379> they

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
as you know I'm a mid-foot strap they

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.199 
as you know I'm a mid-foot strap they
should<00:02:16.709> have<00:02:16.800> had<00:02:16.980> it<00:02:17.010> like<00:02:17.340> maybe<00:02:17.580> I<00:02:17.730> just<00:02:18.060> a

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
should have had it like maybe I just a

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:20.270 
should have had it like maybe I just a
design<00:02:18.599> like<00:02:18.870> kind<00:02:19.290> of<00:02:19.319> like<00:02:19.379> a<00:02:19.470> lace<00:02:19.739> cover<00:02:20.040> or

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
design like kind of like a lace cover or

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.210 
design like kind of like a lace cover or
something<00:02:20.670> I<00:02:20.849> don't<00:02:21.330> know<00:02:21.450> but<00:02:21.660> some<00:02:22.530> at<00:02:22.920> least

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:23.220 
something I don't know but some at least

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:24.890 
something I don't know but some at least
one<00:02:23.459> of<00:02:23.580> the<00:02:23.640> steps<00:02:23.910> to<00:02:24.120> get<00:02:24.300> that<00:02:24.450> shoe<00:02:24.720> on

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
one of the steps to get that shoe on

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.460 
one of the steps to get that shoe on
should<00:02:25.680> have<00:02:25.800> been<00:02:26.599> taken<00:02:27.599> away<00:02:27.690> so<00:02:27.840> this<00:02:28.230> way

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
should have been taken away so this way

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:29.839 
should have been taken away so this way
it<00:02:28.500> would<00:02:28.709> have<00:02:28.830> been<00:02:28.920> much<00:02:29.099> easier<00:02:29.160> for<00:02:29.610> the

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:29.849 
it would have been much easier for the

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:31.550 
it would have been much easier for the
person<00:02:30.030> who<00:02:30.269> was<00:02:30.569> buying<00:02:30.840> them<00:02:31.140> to<00:02:31.290> get<00:02:31.410> them

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
person who was buying them to get them

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:35.059 
person who was buying them to get them
on<00:02:31.680> and<00:02:31.860> off<00:02:32.000> but<00:02:33.410> outside<00:02:34.410> of<00:02:34.440> that<00:02:34.590> I<00:02:34.980> still
