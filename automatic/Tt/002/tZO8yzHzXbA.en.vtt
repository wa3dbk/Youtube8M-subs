00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:03.530
 for endesa 

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:13.290
 very good to tuzzio alex how are you 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:16.049
 I am inflated and today I bring you a video of 

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:18.840
 white 2 if you guys have heard well 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.550
 we go back to white 2 again and it seems 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.739
 that we have already found the key point 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:26.339
 to make it lobbys you have already seen 

00:00:22.739 --> 00:00:28.829
 where zotti and now it's my turn 

00:00:26.339 --> 00:00:31.050
 has left and then we have decided 

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:32.460
 again go back to the lobbies as you go 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.880
 to be able to see in this game 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:38.280
 given 30,000 points per game is worth no 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.230
 I see myself a lot because I've been good 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:45.160
 trying and was trying things 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:47.230
 putting things and good the truth is that 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:50.250
 everything works fine because it's for 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:53.220
 enter the game and you will see 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:54.810
 how much happening second kill and already 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:56.160
 people start people to throw or be 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:59.100
 that works then you're going to see how 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.040
 he killed me too and he gives exactly 30 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.210
 a thousand points so nothing is worth 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:07.619
 soon you know by the channels 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:10.440
 usual twitter I'll say when when 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.940
 we do when we lobby for targets 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.340
 2 and what goes what I go 

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:16.050
 leaving warfare 3 and now yes I'm going 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.520
 having a little more time like this 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:19.290
 that nothing left you with the game 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.060
