00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.680
 hello youtube people today I'm going to 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:07.290
 teach how to make Christmas lights with 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:09.390
 LEDs and with cellular chargers before 

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.040
 start I want to tell you that the the video 

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:13.410
 it's going to be a little bit extensive since there's 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.349
 people who do not know how circuit is made 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.240
 in parallel and in series then so that 

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:21.090
 no questions arise I will explain 

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:23.400
 in detail if you already know about this 

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.830
 you can preview the video and see the 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.140
 structure of the circuit that we are going to 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.810
 assemble the materials that we are going to 

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.369
 use first of all is the charger 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.679
 you can use any type of 

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.449
 charger and use this the chargers 

00:00:34.679 --> 00:00:38.760
 they have an output of 5 to 6 volts 

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:40.739
 then there is no problem you can 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:43.620
 use any then we're going to 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:46.170
 use cables in this way these 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:48.960
 cables are more or less of the number 20 the 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.660
 Individuals of the number 20 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.610
 let's cut them into two sizes I'll 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:57.149
 I recommend that the larger size as 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:01:00.239
 you see it here is 15 to 20 centimeters and 

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:03.510
 the smallest is half and this is 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:06.090
 20 Put it on every 10 to fit the 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.700
 structure of the Christmas lights then 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.280
 we will have in the terms possible 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:15.210
 as we see it here to give detail 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:18.600
 final detail to what we are going to do 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:21.869
 and most importantly, the leds are going to 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.880
 use two types of LEDs the first you 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:27.150
 you can choose the color you want 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.380
 It can be red or white not 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.630
 be green 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.030
 I am going to choose white colors and 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:36.000
 that I have the colors the white color already 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:38.070
 and then and the other one that are the tricolors 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.979
 if you do not know much about the tricolors in 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.690
 the previous video I'll leave the link 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.520
 so you can see the previous video where you 

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:46.920
 I explain how our colors are and 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.840
 some examples then we're going to have 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.640
 two types of LEDs the most important are 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.130
 the tricolors and the other you can 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.360
 choose any kind of colors that 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.010
 you want 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:59.650
 we know that the LEDs have two 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:02.230
 terminals as we see it here and the 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:03.760
 longer terminal is the positive side and 

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:06.070
 the shortest terminal is the side 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:09.160
 negative but what happens if we 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.869
 we cut the terminals like this as 

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.600
 recognize what is the positive side and 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:15.810
 negative for this I have a 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:20.740
 very simple graph as we see here 

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:23.020
 within two filaments are led the 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:24.940
 bigger and the smaller one the 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:28.120
 smaller filament is the side 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:30.670
 positive the largest filament like 

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:33.280
 we see in the graph is the negative side 

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:35.440
 then once you've already cut 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:37.239
 the terminals or the legs of the leds 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.400
 you are going to know what is the positive side 

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:42.879
 and negative 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:44.849
 once you 've cut each leg 

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:49.209
 of the LEDs you will need in my case 

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:51.670
 I will use 10 tricolors and 20 leds 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:53.769
 white then what we 

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:56.650
 let's do first of all is to put together 

00:02:53.769 --> 00:02:57.790
 this series circuit circuit how is 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:58.930
 this 

00:02:57.790 --> 00:03:01.719
 3 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.760
 in series in the center will be the 

00:03:01.719 --> 00:03:06.310
 tricolor in the center of the tricolor 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:09.069
 so for this first let's take 

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:11.980
 the tricolor and we are going to weld it in 

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:15.260
 two terminals two cables milestones 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:18.080
 shorter size we change seen 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:20.689
 they are already soldiers there is more or less 

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:24.409
 would be this way then in each 

00:03:20.689 --> 00:03:26.209
 extreme we will solder him the leds 

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:29.599
 whites or the colors that you have 

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:31.440
 chosen more or less we will be left 

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:34.650
 this form 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:36.100
 there I have a model of this form there 

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:38.800
 is 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:41.440
 we are going to stay this way in the 

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:44.260
 center is the tricolor and on the edges 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:47.080
 there are positive leds 

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:49.570
 I say sorry the white LEDs that 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:52.650
 let's use in my case how is this 

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:54.510
 that we have the led 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.310
 then the way to weld in the 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:59.459
 next and for me my case this is the 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:01.409
 negative side is to determine the loose is 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:03.599
 the negative side the one that is welded is 

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:05.879
 the positive side then I have to 

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:09.150
 solder it with the negative side of the 

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:11.459
 center as we see here positive negative 

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:12.810
 positive negative then you have to have 

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:14.909
 into account because if we 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:17.100
 We were wrong in that part because our 

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:20.130
 led is not going to learn once 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:23.400
 we have soldier in series all in my 

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:28.350
 case I have 10 of these 10 of these we're going 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:32.800
 to have the soldier in this way 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:35.470
 we are going to have two shapes in half 

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.590
 first we have this way then to 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:41.050
 half of them on the negative side 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:44.169
 let's solder the cable cited larger 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:45.510
 there we are going to solder the cable he cited 

00:04:44.169 --> 00:04:47.790
 larger 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:48.960
 as we already have here this is my side 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:51.720
 negative 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:54.360
 initially I had this is this is my 

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:56.430
 negative side or in my case here the 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:58.890
 Negative side gives you more cable 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:00.240
 big and I would stay like this there 

00:04:58.890 --> 00:05:04.530
 is 

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:06.449
 then in half if I have five of these 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:08.430
 in my case you can have more if 

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:11.370
 you want your lights to be bigger 

00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:14.819
 in my case five of these and half 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:18.389
 we're going to be welded on the positive side you 

00:05:14.819 --> 00:05:20.400
 We are going to solder 22 of your cables more 

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:23.330
 great as we see it here then we 

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:26.400
 will be 5 of these and 5 of these 

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:29.099
 remember that this part is 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:31.470
 soldier on the negative side and in this 

00:05:29.099 --> 00:05:34.889
 part is soldier on the positive side and 

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:37.500
 two LEDs in the terminal that was 

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:40.050
 loose we had initially and now 

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:42.409
 we have this way now we are going to 

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:42.409
 proceed 

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:50.490
 in welding we have this way 

00:05:47.460 --> 00:05:53.320
 we already have this here and we are not going to 

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:56.310
 extend up 

00:05:53.320 --> 00:06:00.520
 we are going to have this way 

00:05:56.310 --> 00:06:02.830
 then this terminal the other the other that 

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:05.050
 we had about in this way here in 

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:08.620
 this part in this case on the side 

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:10.690
 positive let's solder here 

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:15.419
 then it will fit us then let's go 

00:06:10.690 --> 00:06:15.419
 to drop it quickly here this year 

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:18.650
 Y 

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:29.130
 they are already soldiers 

00:06:25.380 --> 00:06:29.960
 and finally we're going to get this 

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:34.140
 configuration 

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:37.190
 we are going to extend this the terminal and 

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:39.990
 we are going to have this configuration already 

00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:42.600
 let's have five of these in my case 

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:45.570
 they're already set up and we're going to have 

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:48.390
 five of these then from the part of 

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:51.400
 background that is coming this side we are going to 

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:54.639
 solder it in this part 

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:57.190
 there is in this that is staying 

00:06:54.639 --> 00:07:00.330
 we are going to weld here we are going to put 

00:06:57.190 --> 00:07:00.330
 temporarily here 

00:07:01.009 --> 00:07:07.930
 on the other side that has remained and then 

00:07:03.919 --> 00:07:07.930
 let's plug in the charger 

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:14.780
 Once you plug in the charger, we'll go 

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:17.970
 to put in this case is the positive side 

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:21.480
 and let's feed it with that to see 

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:24.960
 if it is well configured 

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:26.790
 and as we see all the LEDs are 

00:07:24.960 --> 00:07:28.830
 turning on we have to make sure that 

00:07:26.790 --> 00:07:30.660
 all the LEDs light up because if one 

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:32.750
 it is misconfigured because it is not going to 

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:35.160
 learn then we're going to complicate 

00:07:32.750 --> 00:07:37.650
 in the next video in the second 

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:40.230
 part to explain how is the 

00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:43.760
 configuration of the entire circuit not you 

00:07:40.230 --> 00:07:43.760
 forget to watch the next video
