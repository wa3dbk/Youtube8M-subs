that<00:02:34.349> they<00:02:34.440> hate<00:02:34.620> maths<00:02:34.890> I<00:02:35.099> want<00:02:35.370> them<00:02:35.459> to<00:02:35.489> get

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
that they hate maths I want them to get

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:37.899 
that they hate maths I want them to get
to<00:02:35.760> key<00:02:35.879> stage<00:02:36.060> two<00:02:36.329> and<00:02:36.480> really<00:02:36.930> love<00:02:37.290> it<00:02:37.500> and

00:02:37.899 --> 00:02:37.909 
to key stage two and really love it and

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:44.360 
to key stage two and really love it and
understand<00:02:38.909> it<00:02:39.319> how<00:02:40.319> many<00:02:40.379> show<00:02:40.980> me<00:02:43.280> should<00:02:44.280> we

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:44.370 
understand it how many show me should we

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:46.550 
understand it how many show me should we
show<00:02:44.640> how<00:02:44.849> we<00:02:44.909> do<00:02:45.090> that<00:02:45.180> as<00:02:45.329> a<00:02:45.360> number<00:02:45.840> bond<00:02:46.049> we

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
show how we do that as a number bond we

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:57.229 
show how we do that as a number bond we
say<00:02:47.360> zero<00:02:50.480> I<00:02:55.519> devised<00:02:56.519> these<00:02:56.730> symbols<00:02:57.120> at<00:02:57.209> the

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:57.239 
say zero I devised these symbols at the

00:02:57.239 --> 00:02:59.660 
say zero I devised these symbols at the
beginning<00:02:57.629> of<00:02:57.720> the<00:02:57.870> year<00:02:58.079> and<00:02:58.379> alongside<00:02:59.310> the

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
beginning of the year and alongside the

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.059 
beginning of the year and alongside the
children<00:03:00.150> and<00:03:00.359> to<00:03:01.140> make<00:03:01.290> it<00:03:01.470> the<00:03:01.650> math<00:03:01.859> more

00:03:02.059 --> 00:03:02.069 
children and to make it the math more

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:04.039 
children and to make it the math more
personal<00:03:02.760> to<00:03:02.909> them<00:03:03.090> so<00:03:03.629> that<00:03:03.659> they<00:03:03.810> have

00:03:04.039 --> 00:03:04.049 
personal to them so that they have

00:03:04.049 --> 00:03:07.009 
personal to them so that they have
ownership<00:03:04.890> of<00:03:05.400> their<00:03:05.970> mathematical<00:03:06.659> learning

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
ownership of their mathematical learning

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:08.599 
ownership of their mathematical learning
and<00:03:07.230> I<00:03:07.319> think<00:03:07.530> it's<00:03:07.709> really<00:03:08.010> worked<00:03:08.310> quite

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:08.609 
and I think it's really worked quite

00:03:08.609 --> 00:03:12.789 
and I think it's really worked quite
well<00:03:08.640> is<00:03:09.030> an<00:03:09.150> equal<00:03:09.569> sign<00:03:09.810> equals<00:03:11.480> Sam<00:03:12.480> I

00:03:12.789 --> 00:03:12.799 
well is an equal sign equals Sam I

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:15.410 
well is an equal sign equals Sam I
didn't<00:03:13.799> know<00:03:13.920> when<00:03:14.129> I<00:03:14.159> devised<00:03:14.519> them<00:03:14.790> how<00:03:15.239> well

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:15.420 
didn't know when I devised them how well

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:16.339 
didn't know when I devised them how well
it<00:03:15.510> would<00:03:15.569> go<00:03:15.629> down<00:03:15.900> if<00:03:16.049> they<00:03:16.109> would<00:03:16.230> actually

00:03:16.339 --> 00:03:16.349 
it would go down if they would actually

00:03:16.349 --> 00:03:18.649 
it would go down if they would actually
remember<00:03:16.890> it<00:03:17.010> or<00:03:17.190> not<00:03:17.370> but<00:03:17.909> they<00:03:18.030> have<00:03:18.060> and

00:03:18.649 --> 00:03:18.659 
remember it or not but they have and

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:20.509 
remember it or not but they have and
they've<00:03:19.079> really<00:03:19.349> taken<00:03:19.590> on<00:03:19.799> board<00:03:20.129> and<00:03:20.340> now

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:20.519 
they've really taken on board and now

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:22.550 
they've really taken on board and now
when<00:03:21.239> we're<00:03:21.359> doing<00:03:21.450> any<00:03:21.629> addition<00:03:22.169> they<00:03:22.319> use

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
when we're doing any addition they use

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:23.530 
when we're doing any addition they use
those<00:03:22.709> symbols<00:03:22.919> as<00:03:23.160> well<00:03:23.280> and<00:03:23.370> it<00:03:23.430> really

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:23.540 
those symbols as well and it really

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:34.039 
those symbols as well and it really
enforces<00:03:24.540> the<00:03:24.660> point<00:03:29.060> equals<00:03:30.060> Oh<00:03:33.049> brilliant

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:34.049 
enforces the point equals Oh brilliant

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:36.229 
enforces the point equals Oh brilliant

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:36.239 
they actually get to get up and use

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:38.119 
they actually get to get up and use
their<00:03:36.480> bodies<00:03:36.780> and<00:03:37.079> they<00:03:37.560> have<00:03:37.739> to<00:03:37.859> they're

00:03:42.619 --> 00:03:42.629 
key in math they're not just is not

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:44.150 
key in math they're not just is not

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:44.160 
they've learnt it by rote

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.589 
they've learnt it by rote
because<00:03:44.400> they<00:03:44.489> have<00:03:44.639> to<00:03:44.790> remember<00:03:45.180> those

00:03:45.589 --> 00:03:45.599 
because they have to remember those

actually<00:04:58.180> learning<00:04:58.570> so<00:04:58.960> I<00:04:58.990> think<00:04:59.110> if<00:04:59.350> you<00:04:59.470> make

00:04:59.490 --> 00:04:59.500 
actually learning so I think if you make

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:01.740 
actually learning so I think if you make
the<00:04:59.800> lesson<00:05:00.100> really<00:05:00.220> fun<00:05:00.490> and<00:05:00.640> enjoyable<00:05:01.120> they

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:01.750 
the lesson really fun and enjoyable they

00:05:01.750 --> 00:05:03.510 
the lesson really fun and enjoyable they
forget<00:05:02.080> that<00:05:02.200> they're<00:05:02.380> learning<00:05:02.530> and<00:05:03.130> they'll

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:03.520 
forget that they're learning and they'll

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:04.860 
forget that they're learning and they'll
just<00:05:03.700> do<00:05:03.850> it<00:05:03.970> without<00:05:04.120> thinking

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:04.870 
just do it without thinking

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:18.630 
two lines in so success criteria we
develop<00:05:17.380> together<00:05:17.560> as<00:05:17.860> a<00:05:17.890> class<00:05:18.070> and<00:05:18.610> we

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:18.640 
develop together as a class and we

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:20.850 
develop together as a class and we
looked<00:05:19.330> at<00:05:19.450> column<00:05:19.750> addition<00:05:20.140> and<00:05:20.350> then<00:05:20.590> we

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:20.860 
looked at column addition and then we

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:23.040 
looked at column addition and then we
wrote<00:05:21.220> lists<00:05:21.670> on<00:05:21.820> a<00:05:21.850> step-by-step<00:05:22.300> guide<00:05:22.570> on

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:23.050 
wrote lists on a step-by-step guide on

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:27.120 
wrote lists on a step-by-step guide on
how<00:05:23.140> to<00:05:23.710> achieve<00:05:24.250> that<00:05:24.520> add<00:05:25.330> the<00:05:25.390> light<00:05:26.170> then

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:27.130 
how to achieve that add the light then

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:29.540 
how to achieve that add the light then
add<00:05:27.280> the<00:05:27.520> left<00:05:27.760> that's<00:05:28.420> to<00:05:28.810> tell<00:05:29.020> you<00:05:29.230> like

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:29.550 
add the left that's to tell you like

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:32.370 
add the left that's to tell you like
first<00:05:30.550> of<00:05:30.790> all<00:05:30.940> you<00:05:31.210> had<00:05:31.330> the<00:05:31.510> unit<00:05:31.870> which<00:05:32.200> is

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:32.380 
first of all you had the unit which is

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:33.870 
first of all you had the unit which is
like<00:05:32.590> once<00:05:33.160> we've<00:05:33.340> done<00:05:33.460> that<00:05:33.520> we've

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:33.880 
like once we've done that we've

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:36.020 
like once we've done that we've
simplified<00:05:34.330> it<00:05:34.570> and<00:05:35.020> then<00:05:35.500> the<00:05:35.620> children

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:36.030 
simplified it and then the children

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:38.700 
simplified it and then the children
created<00:05:37.030> their<00:05:37.150> own<00:05:37.300> actions<00:05:37.960> and<00:05:38.170> their<00:05:38.590> own

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:38.710 
created their own actions and their own

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:42.090 
created their own actions and their own
rap<00:05:38.980> to<00:05:39.220> go<00:05:39.340> with<00:05:39.520> it<00:05:39.700> going<00:05:40.330> tense<00:05:40.870> over<00:05:41.350> and

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:42.100 
rap to go with it going tense over and

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:47.100 
rap to go with it going tense over and
because<00:05:42.790> you<00:05:42.970> have<00:05:43.150> to<00:05:43.420> and<00:05:43.980> put<00:05:45.420> the<00:05:46.420> ten<00:05:46.780> and

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:47.110 
because you have to and put the ten and

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:48.780 
because you have to and put the ten and
if<00:05:47.590> they've<00:05:47.740> got<00:05:47.890> a<00:05:47.920> little<00:05:48.130> routine<00:05:48.520> or<00:05:48.760> a

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:51.220 
little rap then it can help them work

little rap then it can help them work
out<00:05:51.460> what<00:05:51.580> the<00:05:51.670> next<00:05:51.880> step<00:05:52.120> is<00:05:52.300> and<00:05:52.540> just<00:05:52.720> sort

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:53.440 
out what the next step is and just sort

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:54.960 
out what the next step is and just sort
of<00:05:53.500> make<00:05:53.890> it<00:05:53.920> a<00:05:54.070> bit<00:05:54.190> easier<00:05:54.250> for<00:05:54.520> them<00:05:54.700> to<00:05:54.730> get

of make it a bit easier for them to get

of make it a bit easier for them to get
through<00:05:55.150> their<00:05:55.240> work<00:05:55.630> rather<00:05:55.930> than<00:05:56.110> panic<00:05:56.530> I

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:56.710 
through their work rather than panic I
