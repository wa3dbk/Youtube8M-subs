which<00:00:17.250> I<00:00:17.490> updated<00:00:18.150> the<00:00:18.359> flash<00:00:18.600> code<00:00:18.869> so<00:00:19.170> it<00:00:19.470> can

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:19.710 
which I updated the flash code so it can

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:23.599 
which I updated the flash code so it can
be<00:00:19.859> consisted<00:00:20.609> and<00:00:21.320> I<00:00:22.320> have<00:00:23.189> these<00:00:23.369> two

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609 
be consisted and I have these two

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:30.609 
be consisted and I have these two
engines<00:00:23.820> consisted<00:00:24.779> together<00:00:25.400> right<00:00:26.400> now<00:00:26.810> and

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:30.619 

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:35.330 

so<00:00:31.619> why<00:00:31.769> don't<00:00:31.949> we<00:00:31.980> go<00:00:32.189> ahead<00:00:32.309> and<00:00:34.040> take<00:00:35.040> a<00:00:35.070> look

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
so why don't we go ahead and take a look

00:00:35.340 --> 00:01:39.640 
so why don't we go ahead and take a look
at<00:00:35.430> these<00:00:35.550> guys<00:00:35.820> running<00:00:36.120> together

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:39.650 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:44.440 

I<00:01:39.710> don't<00:01:40.490> have<00:01:40.700> all<00:01:41.030> of<00:01:41.330> the<00:01:41.990> Seavey's<00:01:42.790> set<00:01:43.790> to

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
I don't have all of the Seavey's set to

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.600 
I don't have all of the Seavey's set to
have<00:01:44.990> all<00:01:45.290> the<00:01:45.470> functionality<00:01:45.710> go<00:01:46.370> through

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
have all the functionality go through

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:51.810 
have all the functionality go through
with<00:01:46.760> the<00:01:46.880> consisting<00:01:47.570> so<00:01:48.910> what<00:01:49.910> I'm<00:01:50.030> doing<00:01:50.450> is

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:51.820 
with the consisting so what I'm doing is

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.520 
with the consisting so what I'm doing is
I'm<00:01:52.820> just<00:01:52.910> running<00:01:53.570> I'm<00:01:53.720> just<00:01:54.020> running<00:01:54.170> the

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:54.530 
I'm just running I'm just running the

00:01:54.530 --> 00:02:51.530 
I'm just running I'm just running the
lighting<00:01:55.310> separately<00:01:56.120> but<00:01:57.640> that<00:01:58.640> can<00:01:58.820> be<00:01:58.850> done

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.369 

and<00:02:51.629> that<00:02:52.500> is<00:02:52.799> valuable<00:02:53.549> now<00:02:54.510> you<00:02:54.569> could<00:02:55.170> run

00:02:55.369 --> 00:02:55.379 
and that is valuable now you could run

00:02:55.379 --> 00:03:03.020 
and that is valuable now you could run
these<00:02:55.560> big<00:02:55.920> beasts<00:02:56.480> with<00:02:57.480> anything<00:02:58.409> else

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:04.850 

and<00:03:03.180> that<00:03:03.750> should<00:03:03.990> make<00:03:04.140> a<00:03:04.170> nice<00:03:04.440> NS

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
and that should make a nice NS

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:09.230 
and that should make a nice NS
consistent<00:03:07.310> both<00:03:08.310> of<00:03:08.520> these<00:03:08.610> will<00:03:08.820> be<00:03:08.910> up<00:03:09.060> on

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:09.240 
consistent both of these will be up on

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:13.940 
consistent both of these will be up on
eBay<00:03:09.690> as<00:03:10.190> separate<00:03:11.190> items<00:03:11.610> but<00:03:12.350> if<00:03:13.350> you<00:03:13.620> wanted

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950
