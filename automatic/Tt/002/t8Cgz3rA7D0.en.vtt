00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
and warriors what we're looking at is

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.629 
and warriors what we're looking at is
the<00:00:13.259> training<00:00:13.590> that<00:00:13.830> I've<00:00:14.040> done<00:00:14.190> over<00:00:14.250> the

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
the training that I've done over the

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.550 
the training that I've done over the
last<00:00:14.670> eight<00:00:15.089> weeks<00:00:15.330> should<00:00:15.900> have<00:00:16.109> made<00:00:16.350> some

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 
last eight weeks should have made some

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.769 
last eight weeks should have made some
change<00:00:16.890> to<00:00:17.010> their<00:00:17.220> physical<00:00:17.670> capacities<00:00:18.240> and

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
change to their physical capacities and

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:20.359 
change to their physical capacities and
we're<00:00:19.020> making<00:00:19.199> sure<00:00:19.650> that<00:00:19.859> they<00:00:19.980> can<00:00:20.189> actually

00:00:20.359 --> 00:00:20.369 
we're making sure that they can actually

00:00:20.369 --> 00:00:22.960 
we're making sure that they can actually
play<00:00:20.939> the<00:00:21.150> game<00:00:21.390> that<00:00:21.420> we<00:00:21.869> want<00:00:22.140> them<00:00:22.320> to<00:00:22.350> claim

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:22.970 
play the game that we want them to claim

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:26.720 
play the game that we want them to claim
first<00:00:23.970> up<00:00:24.269> the<00:00:24.869> scaly<00:00:25.380> issue<00:00:25.560> of<00:00:25.920> body<00:00:26.460> weight

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:26.730 
first up the scaly issue of body weight

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.599 
first up the scaly issue of body weight
last<00:00:27.689> time<00:00:27.900> we<00:00:28.080> got--we<00:00:28.260> was<00:00:28.949> about<00:00:29.160> six<00:00:29.429> weeks

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
last time we got--we was about six weeks

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.170 
last time we got--we was about six weeks
ago<00:00:29.789> I<00:00:30.330> was<00:00:30.990> just<00:00:31.349> under<00:00:31.590> the<00:00:31.619> 110<00:00:32.160> and<00:00:32.489> now<00:00:33.030> I'm

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
ago I was just under the 110 and now I'm

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.150 
ago I was just under the 110 and now I'm
back<00:00:33.300> to<00:00:33.360> about<00:00:33.570> 107<00:00:34.079> so<00:00:34.469> you<00:00:34.739> drop<00:00:34.920> a<00:00:34.950> few

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
back to about 107 so you drop a few

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.200 
back to about 107 so you drop a few
kilos<00:00:35.550> since<00:00:35.850> then<00:00:36.059> good<00:00:36.980> one<00:00:38.000> 12.4<00:00:39.000> way

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
kilos since then good one 12.4 way

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.840 
kilos since then good one 12.4 way
that's<00:00:39.450> a<00:00:39.570> damn<00:00:39.809> oh<00:00:40.110> that<00:00:40.500> one<00:00:40.739> right<00:00:40.980> whole

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
that's a damn oh that one right whole

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.600 
that's a damn oh that one right whole
idea<00:00:42.270> is<00:00:42.300> to<00:00:42.600> get<00:00:43.079> a<00:00:43.140> bit<00:00:43.320> fitter<00:00:43.530> and<00:00:43.649> avoid

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
idea is to get a bit fitter and avoid

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.160 
idea is to get a bit fitter and avoid
the<00:00:44.730> middle<00:00:44.969> life<00:00:45.090> crisis<00:00:45.510> as<00:00:45.629> it<00:00:45.750> were<00:00:45.870> and<00:00:45.930> so

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
the middle life crisis as it were and so

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.529 
the middle life crisis as it were and so
on<00:00:46.350> get<00:00:47.340> to<00:00:47.460> inspect<00:00:47.820> yesterday<00:00:48.239> I'll<00:00:48.420> be

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
on get to inspect yesterday I'll be

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.150 
on get to inspect yesterday I'll be
pretty<00:00:48.660> happy<00:00:48.809> else<00:00:49.110> first<00:00:49.289> I<00:00:52.039> looked<00:00:53.039> almost

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
pretty happy else first I looked almost

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.950 
pretty happy else first I looked almost
about<00:00:53.550> four<00:00:53.699> kilos<00:00:54.120> in<00:00:54.329> the<00:00:54.420> last<00:00:54.570> six<00:00:54.809> weeks

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.740 
about four kilos in the last six weeks
so<00:00:55.230> explain<00:00:55.559> a<00:00:55.800> fantastic<00:00:56.579> time<00:00:57.000> and<00:00:57.629> I've

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
so explain a fantastic time and I've

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.139 
so explain a fantastic time and I've
worked<00:00:57.989> hard<00:00:58.230> I<00:00:58.500> think<00:00:58.739> over<00:00:59.190> fifty<00:00:59.879> percent

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
worked hard I think over fifty percent

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.540 
worked hard I think over fifty percent
of<00:01:00.329> am<00:01:00.449> I<00:01:00.600> seeing<00:01:01.379> a<00:01:01.530> good<00:01:01.739> training<00:01:02.129> effect

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
of am I seeing a good training effect

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.729 
of am I seeing a good training effect
they're<00:01:03.300> coming<00:01:03.510> down<00:01:03.899> and<00:01:04.110> white<00:01:04.320> their<00:01:04.559> body

competitions changing we can see already
that<00:01:07.409> their<00:01:07.680> power<00:01:07.979> levels<00:01:08.340> have<00:01:08.520> come<00:01:09.030> up

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
that their power levels have come up

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.550 
that their power levels have come up
from<00:01:09.450> their<00:01:09.600> vertical<00:01:09.750> jump<00:01:10.229> from<00:01:10.409> their

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
from their vertical jump from their

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.100 
from their vertical jump from their
sprint<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:11.670> results<00:01:12.210> are<00:01:12.330> testament<00:01:12.900> to<00:01:13.020> the

the better put three and last time and
it<00:01:31.650> gets<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:32.040> win<00:01:32.189> this<00:01:32.340> time<00:01:32.579> to<00:01:32.820> it

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
it gets the win this time to it

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.420 
it gets the win this time to it
ah<00:01:35.210> Boise<00:01:36.210> it's<00:01:36.390> poison<00:01:36.750> it<00:01:36.870> damn<00:01:37.190> y'all<00:01:38.190> start

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
ah Boise it's poison it damn y'all start

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:39.770 
ah Boise it's poison it damn y'all start
from<00:01:38.550> pretty<00:01:38.790> low<00:01:38.910> base<00:01:39.090> any<00:01:39.300> way<00:01:39.360> so<00:01:39.480> it's

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
from pretty low base any way so it's

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:40.910 
from pretty low base any way so it's
actually<00:01:39.870> good<00:01:40.140> to<00:01:40.230> see<00:01:40.350> some<00:01:40.590> progression

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
actually good to see some progression

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.700 
actually good to see some progression
and<00:01:41.160> yeah<00:01:41.730> it's<00:01:41.880> a<00:01:42.000> long<00:01:42.150> read<00:01:42.240> a<00:01:42.480> bit<00:01:42.630> dumb<00:01:42.870> boy

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:43.710 
and yeah it's a long read a bit dumb boy

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.410 
and yeah it's a long read a bit dumb boy
it's<00:01:43.890> good<00:01:44.010> to<00:01:44.070> improve<00:01:44.400> forget<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.240> fitter

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
it's good to improve forget the fitter

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.420 
it's good to improve forget the fitter
and<00:01:45.510> fitter<00:01:45.920> you're<00:01:46.920> almost<00:01:47.010> nothing<00:01:47.190> goes

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
and fitter you're almost nothing goes

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:48.890 
and fitter you're almost nothing goes
last<00:01:47.790> time<00:01:48.000> 12<00:01:48.300> and<00:01:48.480> look<00:01:48.570> at<00:01:48.660> the<00:01:48.750> end<00:01:48.870> of

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:48.900 
last time 12 and look at the end of

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.230 
last time 12 and look at the end of
tensor<00:01:49.320> like<00:01:49.740> Sean<00:01:50.010> something<00:01:50.400> so<00:01:50.580> what<00:01:51.180> he

00:01:51.230 --> 00:01:51.240 
tensor like Sean something so what he

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:52.760 
tensor like Sean something so what he
boots<00:01:51.420> maybe<00:01:51.600> we<00:01:51.720> got<00:01:51.810> way<00:01:52.260> we<00:01:52.380> got<00:01:52.410> down<00:01:52.620> to
