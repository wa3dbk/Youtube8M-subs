00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:07.450 
okay so that's a quick question about

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:13.080 
okay so that's a quick question about
the<00:00:07.630> hanger<00:00:07.900> ah<00:00:10.320> sure<00:00:11.320> in<00:00:11.789> pretty<00:00:12.789> much<00:00:12.850> any

the hanger ah sure in pretty much any

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:15.299 
the hanger ah sure in pretty much any
movie<00:00:13.450> or<00:00:13.570> any<00:00:13.719> situation<00:00:14.230> we<00:00:14.350> have<00:00:14.379> a<00:00:14.830> carrier

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:15.309 
movie or any situation we have a carrier

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:17.160 
movie or any situation we have a carrier
there's<00:00:15.580> always<00:00:15.820> the<00:00:15.969> hope<00:00:16.119> that<00:00:16.930> you<00:00:17.110> will

there's always the hope that you will
find<00:00:17.470> the<00:00:17.619> enemy<00:00:17.770> carrier<00:00:18.220> has<00:00:18.369> left<00:00:18.640> their

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:18.789 
find the enemy carrier has left their

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:21.060 
find the enemy carrier has left their
doors<00:00:18.820> open<00:00:19.240> and<00:00:20.140> you<00:00:20.259> get<00:00:20.410> some<00:00:20.590> and<00:00:20.859> there<00:00:21.039> a

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:21.070 
doors open and you get some and there a

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:22.769 
doors open and you get some and there a
drop<00:00:21.369> a<00:00:21.400> torpedo<00:00:21.910> or<00:00:22.119> something<00:00:22.420> wrong<00:00:22.539> choice

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:22.779 
drop a torpedo or something wrong choice

drop a torpedo or something wrong choice
I<00:00:23.460> mean<00:00:24.460> if<00:00:24.759> you<00:00:24.910> come<00:00:25.060> along<00:00:25.210> addressing<00:00:25.720> the

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:25.779 
I mean if you come along addressing the

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:26.909 
I mean if you come along addressing the
dude<00:00:25.900> forgot<00:00:26.140> to<00:00:26.289> close<00:00:26.439> the<00:00:26.500> door<00:00:26.740> and<00:00:26.830> you

00:00:26.909 --> 00:00:26.919 
dude forgot to close the door and you

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:28.859 
dude forgot to close the door and you
have<00:00:27.039> made<00:00:27.279> a<00:00:27.310> gladiator<00:00:27.849> where<00:00:28.390> you<00:00:28.539> to<00:00:28.660> send

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:28.869 
have made a gladiator where you to send

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:30.870 
have made a gladiator where you to send
the<00:00:28.929> torpedo<00:00:29.320> is<00:00:29.650> that<00:00:30.130> the<00:00:30.400> sort<00:00:30.580> of<00:00:30.699> thing

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:30.880 
the torpedo is that the sort of thing

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.220 
the torpedo is that the sort of thing
where<00:00:31.089> you<00:00:31.449> know<00:00:31.480> you<00:00:31.630> might<00:00:31.869> get<00:00:32.020> a<00:00:32.050> little

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:32.230 
where you know you might get a little

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:34.200 
where you know you might get a little
bit<00:00:32.380> of<00:00:32.439> advantage<00:00:32.800> I<00:00:33.160> know<00:00:33.640> definitely<00:00:33.970> I

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:34.210 
bit of advantage I know definitely I

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:36.060 
bit of advantage I know definitely I
mean<00:00:34.240> I<00:00:34.450> we<00:00:34.900> model<00:00:35.200> the<00:00:35.290> damage<00:00:35.650> right<00:00:35.830> so<00:00:36.010> if

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:36.070 
mean I we model the damage right so if

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:37.740 
mean I we model the damage right so if
you<00:00:36.160> wanted<00:00:36.400> to<00:00:36.550> bring<00:00:36.730> in<00:00:36.880> you<00:00:37.240> you<00:00:37.420> can<00:00:37.570> like

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:37.750 
you wanted to bring in you you can like

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.380 
you wanted to bring in you you can like
do<00:00:38.560> some<00:00:38.770> hits<00:00:38.980> holanda<00:00:39.700> ball<00:00:39.880> with<00:00:40.090> something

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:40.390 
do some hits holanda ball with something

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:43.380 
do some hits holanda ball with something
inside<00:00:40.750> but<00:00:41.500> I<00:00:41.800> pass<00:00:42.190> the<00:00:42.370> ami<00:00:42.670> you<00:00:42.760> bypass<00:00:43.180> the

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:43.390 
inside but I pass the ami you bypass the

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:44.670 
inside but I pass the ami you bypass the
shield<00:00:43.630> so<00:00:43.840> you'll<00:00:43.990> be<00:00:44.110> doing<00:00:44.320> internal

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:44.680 
shield so you'll be doing internal

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:47.220 
shield so you'll be doing internal
damage<00:00:45.010> excellent<00:00:45.730> and<00:00:46.540> this<00:00:46.660> is<00:00:46.900> kind<00:00:47.080> of<00:00:47.140> the

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:47.230 
damage excellent and this is kind of the

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:48.450 
damage excellent and this is kind of the
way<00:00:47.320> it<00:00:47.380> looks<00:00:47.500> like<00:00:47.680> even<00:00:47.860> on<00:00:47.980> the<00:00:48.100> smaller

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:48.460 
way it looks like even on the smaller

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.190 
way it looks like even on the smaller
ships<00:00:48.760> we<00:00:49.300> muddle<00:00:49.600> the<00:00:49.690> shields<00:00:50.050> and<00:00:50.080> we

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:50.200 
ships we muddle the shields and we

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.230 
ships we muddle the shields and we
muddle<00:00:50.440> the<00:00:50.530> armor<00:00:50.860> and<00:00:51.040> actually<00:00:51.640> the<00:00:51.790> system

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:52.240 
muddle the armor and actually the system

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:53.790 
muddle the armor and actually the system
hits<00:00:52.480> are<00:00:52.630> actually<00:00:52.870> model<00:00:53.140> correctly<00:00:53.350> so

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:53.800 
hits are actually model correctly so

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:55.770 
hits are actually model correctly so
basically<00:00:54.250> what<00:00:54.370> happens<00:00:54.700> is<00:00:54.850> we<00:00:55.390> reduce<00:00:55.750> the

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:55.780 
basically what happens is we reduce the

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.320 
basically what happens is we reduce the
sort<00:00:56.140> of<00:00:56.200> resistance<00:00:56.830> so<00:00:57.460> like<00:00:57.850> bullets<00:00:58.240> or

00:00:58.320 --> 00:00:58.330 
sort of resistance so like bullets or

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:59.580 
sort of resistance so like bullets or
energy<00:00:58.600> weapons<00:00:58.870> will<00:00:58.990> pass<00:00:59.170> it<00:00:59.350> likewise

00:00:59.580 --> 00:00:59.590 
energy weapons will pass it likewise

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:02.100 
energy weapons will pass it likewise
your<00:00:59.740> armors<00:01:00.010> car<00:01:00.660> doesn't<00:01:01.660> become<00:01:01.870> a<00:01:01.900> barrier

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:02.110 
your armors car doesn't become a barrier

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:03.810 
your armors car doesn't become a barrier
anymore<00:01:02.470> and<00:01:02.860> we<00:01:02.920> trace<00:01:03.190> through<00:01:03.400> the<00:01:03.550> bullet

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:03.820 
anymore and we trace through the bullet

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:05.310 
anymore and we trace through the bullet
and<00:01:03.850> then<00:01:04.059> if<00:01:04.150> we<00:01:04.269> hit<00:01:04.420> system<00:01:04.869> along<00:01:05.080> the<00:01:05.199> way

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:05.320 
and then if we hit system along the way

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.680 
and then if we hit system along the way
we<00:01:06.070> do<00:01:06.189> damage<00:01:06.460> that<00:01:06.640> system<00:01:07.060> so<00:01:07.330> basically

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:07.690 
we do damage that system so basically

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:10.800 
we do damage that system so basically
where<00:01:07.960> you're<00:01:08.110> shooting<00:01:08.610> effects<00:01:09.610> like<00:01:09.810> what

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:10.810 
where you're shooting effects like what

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:12.510 
where you're shooting effects like what
where<00:01:10.990> the<00:01:11.050> system<00:01:11.230> is<00:01:11.500> right<00:01:12.040> so<00:01:12.250> the<00:01:12.310> shock

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:12.520 
where the system is right so the shock

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.310 
where the system is right so the shock
wave<00:01:12.730> would<00:01:12.820> almost<00:01:13.030> literally<00:01:13.390> gut<00:01:13.750> that

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:14.320 
wave would almost literally gut that

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.070 
wave would almost literally gut that
part<00:01:14.620> of<00:01:14.770> the<00:01:14.830> vessel<00:01:15.250> in<00:01:15.520> terms<00:01:15.820> of<00:01:16.030> yeah<00:01:16.630> so<00:01:16.870> I

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:17.080 
part of the vessel in terms of yeah so I

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.140 
part of the vessel in terms of yeah so I
mean<00:01:17.140> like<00:01:17.350> the<00:01:17.530> idea<00:01:17.830> is<00:01:18.010> it's<00:01:18.310> not<00:01:18.400> like<00:01:18.610> once

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:19.150 
mean like the idea is it's not like once

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:20.460 
mean like the idea is it's not like once
you<00:01:19.300> go<00:01:19.390> through<00:01:19.420> the<00:01:19.690> army<00:01:19.990> you<00:01:20.110> like<00:01:20.260> roll

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:20.470 
you go through the army you like roll

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:22.290 
you go through the army you like roll
around<00:01:20.590> a<00:01:20.860> number<00:01:21.130> to<00:01:21.220> see<00:01:21.370> which<00:01:21.520> internal

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:22.300 
around a number to see which internal

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:23.880 
around a number to see which internal
ship<00:01:22.510> system<00:01:22.900> you<00:01:23.020> destroy<00:01:23.440> which<00:01:23.650> is<00:01:23.770> it

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:23.890 
ship system you destroy which is it

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:26.100 
ship system you destroy which is it
that's<00:01:24.370> like<00:01:24.520> a<00:01:24.550> very<00:01:25.000> typical<00:01:25.150> old<00:01:25.810> school

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.110 
that's like a very typical old school

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:27.540 
that's like a very typical old school
way<00:01:26.230> of<00:01:26.260> doing<00:01:26.590> it<00:01:26.680> if<00:01:26.800> you<00:01:26.890> did<00:01:27.010> blah<00:01:27.159> blah<00:01:27.340> but

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:27.550 
way of doing it if you did blah blah but

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:29.070 
way of doing it if you did blah blah but
we're<00:01:27.700> actually<00:01:27.790> physically<00:01:28.390> placing<00:01:28.900> all

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:29.080 
we're actually physically placing all

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.380 
we're actually physically placing all
the<00:01:29.380> items<00:01:30.159> in<00:01:30.310> the<00:01:30.370> ship<00:01:30.670> so<00:01:30.970> there<00:01:31.150> and

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:31.390 
the items in the ship so there and

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:32.940 
the items in the ship so there and
sometimes<00:01:32.170> if<00:01:32.350> you<00:01:32.440> can<00:01:32.530> walk<00:01:32.620> around<00:01:32.890> the

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:32.950 
sometimes if you can walk around the

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:34.170 
sometimes if you can walk around the
ship<00:01:33.100> you'll<00:01:33.220> actually<00:01:33.340> see<00:01:33.670> the<00:01:33.850> items<00:01:34.120> of

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:34.180 
ship you'll actually see the items of

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:35.310 
ship you'll actually see the items of
like<00:01:34.390> the<00:01:34.540> power<00:01:34.720> plant<00:01:34.990> that<00:01:35.050> you<00:01:35.170> should

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:35.320

write exactly so at that point it just
you<00:01:37.420> trace<00:01:37.659> the<00:01:37.690> hit<00:01:37.960> all<00:01:38.080> the<00:01:38.170> way<00:01:38.260> through
