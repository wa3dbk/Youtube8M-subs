taking construction and testing and in

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.040 
taking construction and testing and in
the<00:01:19.009> beginning<00:01:19.100> we<00:01:19.520> separated<00:01:20.119> into<00:01:20.300> a<00:01:20.750> bunch

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:21.050 
the beginning we separated into a bunch

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:22.960 
the beginning we separated into a bunch
of<00:01:21.200> different<00:01:21.530> groups<00:01:21.770> to<00:01:22.039> research<00:01:22.670> all<00:01:22.880> the

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:22.970 
of different groups to research all the

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:24.399 
of different groups to research all the
possible<00:01:23.450> things<00:01:23.630> that<00:01:23.899> we<00:01:23.990> would<00:01:24.110> have<00:01:24.259> to

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:24.409 
possible things that we would have to

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:27.580 
possible things that we would have to
work<00:01:24.590> on<00:01:24.770> for<00:01:25.069> our<00:01:25.280> robot<00:01:25.640> we<00:01:26.630> had<00:01:26.810> a<00:01:26.840> group

the frame we had a group researching

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:38.230 
the frame we had a group researching
stuff<00:01:37.009> that<00:01:37.250> we<00:01:37.340> had<00:01:37.460> to<00:01:37.580> use<00:01:37.610> for<00:01:37.940> the<00:01:38.000> tether

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.240 
stuff that we had to use for the tether

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.999 
stuff that we had to use for the tether
to<00:01:38.450> get<00:01:38.600> the<00:01:38.720> power<00:01:38.899> down<00:01:39.020> to<00:01:39.500> the<00:01:39.710> robot<00:01:39.860> and

00:01:41.999 --> 00:01:42.009 
to get the power down to the robot and

00:01:42.009 --> 00:01:44.290 
to get the power down to the robot and
with<00:01:43.009> all<00:01:43.190> this<00:01:43.340> research<00:01:43.520> then<00:01:43.909> we<00:01:44.000> came

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:44.300 
with all this research then we came

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.270 
with all this research then we came
together<00:01:44.450> and<00:01:44.869> we<00:01:45.080> brainstormed<00:01:45.649> ideas<00:01:45.740> for

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280 
together and we brainstormed ideas for

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.190 
together and we brainstormed ideas for
what<00:01:46.520> we<00:01:46.700> wanted<00:01:47.060> our<00:01:47.210> robot<00:01:47.630> to<00:01:47.840> look<00:01:47.990> like

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 
what we wanted our robot to look like

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
what we wanted our robot to look like
and<00:01:48.890> we<00:01:49.220> came<00:01:49.429> up<00:01:49.490> with<00:01:49.819> a<00:01:50.060> rectangular<00:01:50.720> frame

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:51.220 
and we came up with a rectangular frame

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:55.059 
and we came up with a rectangular frame
made<00:01:52.220> out<00:01:52.250> of<00:01:52.640> quarter-inch<00:01:53.030> steel<00:01:53.739> that<00:01:54.739> we

00:01:55.059 --> 00:01:55.069 
made out of quarter-inch steel that we

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:59.109 
made out of quarter-inch steel that we
could<00:01:55.550> attach<00:01:56.270> motors<00:01:56.840> to<00:01:57.080> easily<00:01:57.770> and<00:01:58.119> pretty

00:01:59.109 --> 00:01:59.119 
could attach motors to easily and pretty

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:00.609 
could attach motors to easily and pretty
much<00:01:59.179> everything<00:01:59.539> on<00:01:59.810> a<00:01:59.840> robot<00:02:00.200> ended<00:02:00.530> up

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:00.619 
much everything on a robot ended up

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:03.430 
much everything on a robot ended up
being<00:02:00.860> movable<00:02:01.520> and<00:02:01.849> so<00:02:02.750> that<00:02:02.869> we<00:02:03.020> can<00:02:03.200> make

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:03.440 
being movable and so that we can make

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:06.760 
being movable and so that we can make
adjustments<00:02:03.709> as<00:02:04.250> needed

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:06.770 

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:09.109 

what<00:02:07.770> were<00:02:07.890> some<00:02:08.070> of<00:02:08.130> the<00:02:08.310> challenges<00:02:08.340> that

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
what were some of the challenges that

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.020 
what were some of the challenges that
you<00:02:09.240> folks<00:02:09.950> encountered<00:02:10.950> in<00:02:11.100> the<00:02:11.460> project<00:02:11.910> one

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
you folks encountered in the project one

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.490 
you folks encountered in the project one
of<00:02:12.120> the<00:02:12.210> biggest<00:02:12.420> challenges<00:02:12.930> we<00:02:13.080> encountered

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
of the biggest challenges we encountered

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.680 
of the biggest challenges we encountered
was with<00:02:14.310> your<00:02:14.490> electronics<00:02:15.060> box<00:02:15.300> because

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690 
was with your electronics box because

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.150 
was with your electronics box because
getting<00:02:15.900> electronics<00:02:16.380> wet<00:02:16.590> doesn't<00:02:17.010> really

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
getting electronics wet doesn't really

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.030 
getting electronics wet doesn't really
work<00:02:17.340> to<00:02:17.550> help<00:02:17.700> of<00:02:17.940> anything<00:02:18.360> so<00:02:18.960> our<00:02:19.620> biggest

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
work to help of anything so our biggest

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.430 
work to help of anything so our biggest
challenge<00:02:20.340> was<00:02:20.460> every<00:02:21.300> time<00:02:21.480> we<00:02:21.960> would<00:02:22.170> test

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
challenge was every time we would test

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.340 
challenge was every time we would test
the<00:02:22.800> box<00:02:23.490> it<00:02:23.760> would<00:02:23.880> leak<00:02:24.090> so<00:02:24.720> what<00:02:25.140> we<00:02:25.230> would

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
the box it would leak so what we would

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.200 
the box it would leak so what we would
do<00:02:25.530> is<00:02:25.710> it<00:02:25.920> took<00:02:26.370> two<00:02:26.730> weeks<00:02:26.880> to<00:02:27.060> actually

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:27.210 
do is it took two weeks to actually

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.480 
do is it took two weeks to actually
fully<00:02:27.690> one<00:02:27.900> who<00:02:28.110> the<00:02:28.260> box<00:02:28.470> because<00:02:28.770> it<00:02:29.310> takes

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:29.490 
fully one who the box because it takes

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:31.970 
fully one who the box because it takes
24<00:02:30.210> hours<00:02:30.270> for<00:02:30.570> the<00:02:30.780> silicon<00:02:31.140> to<00:02:31.260> dry<00:02:31.440> and<00:02:31.920> then

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:31.980 
24 hours for the silicon to dry and then

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:34.100 
24 hours for the silicon to dry and then
you<00:02:32.220> put<00:02:32.370> it<00:02:32.490> in<00:02:32.610> and<00:02:33.270> you<00:02:33.360> pull<00:02:33.540> it<00:02:33.630> out<00:02:33.750> you

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
you put it in and you pull it out you

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:35.360 
you put it in and you pull it out you
get<00:02:34.350> the<00:02:34.410> paper<00:02:34.620> towels<00:02:34.800> are<00:02:34.950> wet<00:02:35.070> after<00:02:35.340> a

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
get the paper towels are wet after a

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:36.980 
get the paper towels are wet after a
couple<00:02:35.520> hours<00:02:35.730> and<00:02:36.390> if<00:02:36.480> it's<00:02:36.600> wet<00:02:36.750> then<00:02:36.930> you

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:36.990 
couple hours and if it's wet then you

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:38.150 
couple hours and if it's wet then you
have<00:02:37.080> to<00:02:37.140> do<00:02:37.200> all<00:02:37.230> over<00:02:37.410> again<00:02:37.680> so<00:02:37.950> you'd<00:02:38.070> have

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
have to do all over again so you'd have

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.340 
have to do all over again so you'd have
to<00:02:38.250> wait<00:02:38.370> another<00:02:38.490> 24<00:02:39.030> to<00:02:39.270> 48<00:02:39.600> hours<00:02:39.720> before

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
to wait another 24 to 48 hours before

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:41.630 
to wait another 24 to 48 hours before
actually<00:02:40.800> doing<00:02:40.950> anything<00:02:41.040> again<00:02:41.430> so<00:02:41.610> that

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:41.640 
actually doing anything again so that

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.050 
actually doing anything again so that
was<00:02:41.820> one<00:02:41.940> of<00:02:42.000> the<00:02:42.090> biggest<00:02:42.240> challenges

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:44.060 
was one of the biggest challenges

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:46.470 
was one of the biggest challenges
other<00:02:44.690> challenges<00:02:45.260> we<00:02:45.380> encountered<00:02:45.800> was<00:02:45.800> like

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.480 
other challenges we encountered was like

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.490 
other challenges we encountered was like
finding<00:02:47.480> the<00:02:47.569> right<00:02:47.720> kind<00:02:47.900> of<00:02:47.930> cameras<00:02:48.290> how<00:02:48.440> to

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:48.500 
finding the right kind of cameras how to

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:52.410 
finding the right kind of cameras how to
seal<00:02:48.739> them<00:02:48.980> you<00:02:49.280> know

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:56.610 

and<00:02:53.760> you've<00:02:54.760> haven't<00:02:55.599> done<00:02:55.840> this<00:02:55.990> project

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
and you've haven't done this project

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:00.870 
and you've haven't done this project
before<00:02:57.130> or<00:02:57.640> have<00:02:57.849> you<00:02:58.200> four<00:02:59.200> years<00:02:59.380> ago<00:02:59.880> I

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:00.880 
before or have you four years ago I

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.390 
before or have you four years ago I
think<00:03:01.510> it's<00:03:01.630> four<00:03:02.050> years<00:03:02.230> great<00:03:03.040> we<00:03:03.160> didn't

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:03.400 
think it's four years great we didn't

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.640 
think it's four years great we didn't
place<00:03:03.580> its<00:03:03.940> current<00:03:04.660> seniors<00:03:05.080> on<00:03:05.260> our<00:03:05.440> team

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
place its current seniors on our team

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.040 
place its current seniors on our team
were<00:03:06.370> part<00:03:06.730> of<00:03:06.819> this<00:03:06.940> project<00:03:07.209> and<00:03:07.569> there's<00:03:07.780> in

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:08.050

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 
of you you're new to the project yes how

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:18.150 
of you you're new to the project yes how
was<00:03:16.450> that<00:03:16.660> coming<00:03:17.020> into<00:03:17.319> what<00:03:17.680> looks<00:03:17.950> like<00:03:18.010> a

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:18.160 
was that coming into what looks like a

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.270 
was that coming into what looks like a
wickedly<00:03:18.700> complex<00:03:19.330> project<00:03:19.840> 10<00:03:20.050> and<00:03:20.319> figuring

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
wickedly complex project 10 and figuring

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.520 
wickedly complex project 10 and figuring
it<00:03:21.400> out<00:03:23.250> it<00:03:24.250> was<00:03:24.370> hard<00:03:24.580> at<00:03:24.730> first<00:03:24.760> like<00:03:25.269> it<00:03:25.300> was

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
it out it was hard at first like it was

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.780 
it out it was hard at first like it was
we're<00:03:26.530> under<00:03:26.709> we<00:03:27.010> weren't<00:03:27.310> really<00:03:27.370> sure<00:03:27.489> what

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:27.790 
we're under we weren't really sure what

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:29.210 
we're under we weren't really sure what
we<00:03:27.910> were<00:03:28.000> doing<00:03:28.180> but<00:03:28.269> we<00:03:28.420> did<00:03:28.600> have<00:03:28.750> some

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
we were doing but we did have some

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:31.350 
we were doing but we did have some
experience<00:03:30.220> because<00:03:30.400> of<00:03:30.610> people<00:03:30.970> who<00:03:31.060> did<00:03:31.239> it

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:31.360 
experience because of people who did it

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.720 
experience because of people who did it
in<00:03:31.690> the<00:03:31.840> past<00:03:32.049> like<00:03:32.290> the<00:03:32.319> seniors<00:03:32.769> last<00:03:33.459> time

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:33.730 
in the past like the seniors last time

00:03:33.730 --> 00:03:35.220 
in the past like the seniors last time
they<00:03:33.880> did<00:03:33.910> it<00:03:34.420> came<00:03:34.630> in<00:03:34.780> and<00:03:34.900> talked<00:03:35.019> to<00:03:35.049> us

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:35.230 
they did it came in and talked to us

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:36.870 
they did it came in and talked to us
about<00:03:35.350> what<00:03:35.650> they<00:03:35.769> did<00:03:35.830> they<00:03:36.459> gave<00:03:36.640> us<00:03:36.760> advice

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:36.880 
about what they did they gave us advice

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.930 
about what they did they gave us advice
they<00:03:37.420> helped<00:03:38.080> us<00:03:38.170> just<00:03:39.040> design<00:03:39.640> what<00:03:39.819> we're

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
they helped us just design what we're

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:41.880 
they helped us just design what we're
doing<00:03:40.090> the<00:03:40.180> early<00:03:40.450> stages<00:03:40.720> but<00:03:41.380> after<00:03:41.650> that<00:03:41.739> it

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:41.890 
doing the early stages but after that it

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:43.650 
doing the early stages but after that it
was<00:03:41.950> pretty<00:03:42.069> much<00:03:42.250> off<00:03:42.430> toss<00:03:42.670> it<00:03:43.269> was<00:03:43.390> up<00:03:43.510> to<00:03:43.630> us

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:43.660 
was pretty much off toss it was up to us

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:48.630 
was pretty much off toss it was up to us
to<00:03:43.870> build<00:03:44.380> the<00:03:44.500> robot<00:03:44.680> and<00:03:46.709> there<00:03:47.709> was<00:03:47.920> no<00:03:48.130> plan

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:48.640 
to build the robot and there was no plan

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.059 
to build the robot and there was no plan
for<00:03:49.150> the<00:03:49.239> robot<00:03:49.390> provided<00:03:50.260> by<00:03:50.380> anybody<00:03:50.830> else

00:03:51.059 --> 00:03:51.069 
for the robot provided by anybody else

00:03:56.710 --> 00:03:56.720 
and how was that process of figuring out

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:01.240 
and how was that process of figuring out
what<00:03:57.710> you<00:03:57.800> were<00:03:57.920> going<00:03:58.040> to<00:03:58.130> do

didn't really want to be she wanted to
let<00:04:32.300> us<00:04:32.540> figure<00:04:32.750> it<00:04:32.900> out<00:04:33.020> you<00:04:33.140> know<00:04:33.170> so<00:04:33.470> we

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:33.590 
let us figure it out you know so we

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:34.900 
let us figure it out you know so we
could<00:04:33.710> actually<00:04:33.740> learn<00:04:34.040> something<00:04:34.310> so<00:04:34.760> she

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:34.910 
could actually learn something so she

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:45.110 
nobody got hurt working on the robot and

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:47.170 
nobody got hurt working on the robot and
just<00:04:45.950> deal<00:04:46.100> with<00:04:46.250> like<00:04:46.400> the<00:04:46.550> logistics<00:04:47.030> of

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:51.710 
the district but all the actual design

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:53.800 
the district but all the actual design
and<00:04:52.070> the<00:04:52.220> robot<00:04:52.550> itself<00:04:52.669> was<00:04:53.090> entirely<00:04:53.540> done

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:53.810 
and the robot itself was entirely done

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:55.740 
and the robot itself was entirely done
by<00:04:53.930> the<00:04:53.990> team

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:55.750 
by the team

00:04:55.750 --> 00:04:58.440 
by the team
and<00:04:56.230> and<00:04:56.860> as<00:04:57.370> a<00:04:57.400> group<00:04:57.940> of<00:04:58.150> high<00:04:58.420> school

00:04:58.440 --> 00:04:58.450 
and and as a group of high school

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:01.350 
and and as a group of high school
students<00:04:59.160> how<00:05:00.160> are<00:05:00.340> you<00:05:00.460> able<00:05:00.610> to<00:05:00.850> kind<00:05:01.090> of<00:05:01.180> get

00:05:01.350 --> 00:05:01.360 
students how are you able to kind of get

00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:03.920 
students how are you able to kind of get
along<00:05:01.690> well<00:05:02.020> enough<00:05:02.050> to<00:05:02.560> get<00:05:02.980> something<00:05:03.220> done

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:03.930 
along well enough to get something done

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:09.330 
along well enough to get something done
well<00:05:04.930> our<00:05:05.230> school<00:05:05.620> is<00:05:05.650> a<00:05:07.290> public<00:05:08.340> selective

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:09.340 
well our school is a public selective

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:11.790 
well our school is a public selective
admissions<00:05:09.880> public<00:05:10.330> school<00:05:10.540> so<00:05:11.140> what<00:05:11.470> that<00:05:11.500> is

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:11.800 
admissions public school so what that is

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:13.080 
admissions public school so what that is
like<00:05:11.980> you<00:05:12.160> have<00:05:12.250> to<00:05:12.340> take<00:05:12.430> a<00:05:12.460> test<00:05:12.700> to<00:05:12.760> get<00:05:12.940> in

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:13.090 
like you have to take a test to get in

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:15.750 
like you have to take a test to get in
so<00:05:13.690> with<00:05:14.140> that<00:05:14.380> in<00:05:14.590> mind<00:05:14.620> everyone<00:05:15.550> in<00:05:15.670> this

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:15.760 
so with that in mind everyone in this

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.720 
so with that in mind everyone in this
school<00:05:15.880> is<00:05:16.270> very<00:05:16.300> similar<00:05:17.140> so<00:05:17.770> everyone<00:05:18.700> can

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:18.730 
school is very similar so everyone can

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:21.600 
school is very similar so everyone can
really<00:05:19.060> get<00:05:19.180> along<00:05:19.390> really<00:05:19.600> well<00:05:19.720> and<00:05:20.020> so<00:05:20.740> it's

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:21.610 
really get along really well and so it's

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:22.980 
really get along really well and so it's
not<00:05:21.790> that<00:05:21.850> hard<00:05:22.180> to<00:05:22.240> get<00:05:22.420> along<00:05:22.510> with<00:05:22.660> anyone

00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:22.990 
not that hard to get along with anyone

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:25.050 
not that hard to get along with anyone
there<00:05:23.170> isn't<00:05:23.470> really<00:05:24.220> like<00:05:24.280> in<00:05:24.550> average<00:05:24.910> high

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:25.060 
there isn't really like in average high

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:27.270 
there isn't really like in average high
schools<00:05:25.360> there's<00:05:25.600> a<00:05:25.660> huge<00:05:26.440> battery<00:05:26.740> between<00:05:27.250> a

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:27.280 
schools there's a huge battery between a

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:29.640 
schools there's a huge battery between a
freshman<00:05:27.760> a<00:05:27.910> senior<00:05:28.360> or<00:05:28.960> you<00:05:29.110> know<00:05:29.230> the<00:05:29.410> class

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:29.650 
freshman a senior or you know the class

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:31.350 
freshman a senior or you know the class
differences<00:05:30.310> but<00:05:30.790> in<00:05:30.910> our<00:05:31.000> school<00:05:31.240> it's

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:31.360 
differences but in our school it's

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:33.450 
differences but in our school it's
really<00:05:31.600> well<00:05:32.140> meshed<00:05:32.380> together<00:05:32.500> plus<00:05:33.280> our

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:33.460 
really well meshed together plus our

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:35.159 
really well meshed together plus our
schools<00:05:33.669> rather<00:05:34.030> small<00:05:34.419> school<00:05:34.690> our<00:05:34.870> greed

00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:35.169 
schools rather small school our greed

00:05:35.169 --> 00:05:37.080 
schools rather small school our greed
has<00:05:35.410> about<00:05:35.590> 60<00:05:36.010> sequel<00:05:36.340> to<00:05:36.430> school<00:05:36.669> has<00:05:36.880> about

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:37.090 
has about 60 sequel to school has about

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:39.240 
has about 60 sequel to school has about
260<00:05:37.870> so<00:05:38.350> most<00:05:38.560> of<00:05:38.680> us<00:05:38.800> know<00:05:38.950> pretty<00:05:39.190> much

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:39.250 
260 so most of us know pretty much

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:41.760 
260 so most of us know pretty much
everyone<00:05:39.610> is<00:05:39.850> so<00:05:40.660> no<00:05:41.380> one<00:05:41.530> is<00:05:41.620> really

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:41.770 
everyone is so no one is really

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:43.460 
everyone is so no one is really
strangers<00:05:42.340> around<00:05:42.610> in<00:05:42.790> our<00:05:42.880> school

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:43.470 
strangers around in our school

00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:45.350 
strangers around in our school
