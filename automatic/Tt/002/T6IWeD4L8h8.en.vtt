00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.709 
then I'm going to be applying a thin
layer<00:01:58.979> of<00:01:59.039> lip<00:01:59.429> balm<00:01:59.640> and<00:01:59.670> then<00:01:59.939> just<00:02:00.210> blending

00:02:05.059 --> 00:02:05.069 
you don't want too much excess lip gloss

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:07.219 
you don't want too much excess lip gloss
because<00:02:05.219> that<00:02:05.460> might<00:02:05.640> make<00:02:05.880> her<00:02:06.240> lips<00:02:06.539> lip

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
because that might make her lips lip

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.309 
because that might make her lips lip
balm<00:02:07.530> because<00:02:08.099> that<00:02:08.369> may<00:02:08.489> make<00:02:08.819> the<00:02:09.319> lipstick

00:02:10.309 --> 00:02:10.319 
balm because that may make the lipstick

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:11.420 
balm because that may make the lipstick
slide<00:02:10.679> off<00:02:10.860> of<00:02:10.890> it

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
then I'm taking this Rimmel London lip

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.039 
then I'm taking this Rimmel London lip
liner<00:02:13.830> and<00:02:14.099> cherry<00:02:14.489> kiss<00:02:14.940> and<00:02:15.690> it's<00:02:15.840> just<00:02:15.959> a

00:02:16.039 --> 00:02:16.049 
liner and cherry kiss and it's just a

00:02:16.049 --> 00:02:18.199 
liner and cherry kiss and it's just a
really<00:02:16.319> pretty<00:02:16.410> berry<00:02:16.950> lip<00:02:17.220> liner<00:02:17.489> and<00:02:17.790> I'm

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 
really pretty berry lip liner and I'm

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:20.570 
really pretty berry lip liner and I'm
going<00:02:18.450> to<00:02:18.510> outline<00:02:19.260> my<00:02:19.500> lips<00:02:19.530> in<00:02:20.069> this<00:02:20.340> lip

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:20.580 
going to outline my lips in this lip

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.000 
going to outline my lips in this lip
liner<00:02:20.610> and<00:02:21.209> I'm<00:02:21.540> also<00:02:21.780> going<00:02:22.110> to<00:02:22.200> fill<00:02:22.680> them<00:02:22.830> in

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:23.010 
liner and I'm also going to fill them in

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.190 
liner and I'm also going to fill them in
so<00:02:23.879> I<00:02:23.910> feel<00:02:24.239> like<00:02:24.269> lip<00:02:24.510> liner<00:02:24.720> is<00:02:24.900> pretty

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:25.200 
so I feel like lip liner is pretty

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.080 
so I feel like lip liner is pretty
important<00:02:25.709> when<00:02:25.890> doing<00:02:26.069> a<00:02:26.340> dark<00:02:26.640> lip<00:02:26.879> because

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
important when doing a dark lip because

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.819 
important when doing a dark lip because
it<00:02:27.209> kind<00:02:27.390> of<00:02:27.450> just<00:02:27.690> helps<00:02:27.840> the<00:02:28.140> lipstick<00:02:28.620> from

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:28.829 
it kind of just helps the lipstick from

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:30.970 
it kind of just helps the lipstick from
bleeding<00:02:28.890> and<00:02:29.579> also<00:02:30.150> makes<00:02:30.360> it<00:02:30.540> last<00:02:30.690> longer

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980 
bleeding and also makes it last longer

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.350 
bleeding and also makes it last longer
especially<00:02:31.980> when<00:02:32.160> you<00:02:32.280> filled<00:02:32.640> the<00:02:32.790> whole<00:02:33.090> lip

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
especially when you filled the whole lip

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.720 
especially when you filled the whole lip
in<00:02:33.599> with<00:02:33.959> the<00:02:34.110> lip<00:02:34.290> liner<00:02:34.530> so<00:02:35.250> if<00:02:35.430> you<00:02:35.549> eat

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
in with the lip liner so if you eat

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.520 
in with the lip liner so if you eat
something<00:02:36.030> in<00:02:36.329> the<00:02:36.450> lipstick<00:02:36.840> wears<00:02:37.019> off<00:02:37.290> you

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
something in the lipstick wears off you

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:40.280 
something in the lipstick wears off you
still<00:02:37.829> have<00:02:38.040> the<00:02:38.160> lip<00:02:38.400> liner<00:02:38.640> underneath<00:02:39.290> so

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
still have the lip liner underneath so

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:41.809 
still have the lip liner underneath so
I'm<00:02:40.560> just<00:02:40.829> applying<00:02:41.069> that<00:02:41.280> to<00:02:41.489> my<00:02:41.579> lips
