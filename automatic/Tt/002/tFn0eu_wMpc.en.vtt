device<00:01:04.790> let's<00:01:05.790> see<00:01:06.000> how<00:01:06.240> the<00:01:06.300> swing<00:01:06.720> works<00:01:08.390> it

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
device let's see how the swing works it

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.130 
device let's see how the swing works it
just<00:01:09.450> works<00:01:09.990> like<00:01:10.230> any<00:01:11.720> kind<00:01:12.720> of

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:14.140 
just works like any kind of

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.639 
just works like any kind of
ordinary<00:01:15.140> tnt<00:01:15.680> cannons<00:01:16.250> that<00:01:16.369> we're

00:01:17.639 --> 00:01:17.649 
ordinary tnt cannons that we're

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:22.899 
ordinary tnt cannons that we're
technology<00:01:18.649> yeah<00:01:19.039> technology<00:01:21.070> firstly<00:01:22.070> let

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:22.909 
technology yeah technology firstly let

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:27.510 
technology yeah technology firstly let
me<00:01:22.939> show<00:01:23.299> you<00:01:24.280> its<00:01:25.280> main<00:01:25.520> components

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 
me show you its main components

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:33.690 
me show you its main components
firstly<00:01:30.240> the<00:01:31.240> water<00:01:31.479> chamber<00:01:31.990> thing<00:01:32.380> that<00:01:33.070> the

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:33.700 
firstly the water chamber thing that the

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:36.749 
firstly the water chamber thing that the
TNT<00:01:34.240> charge<00:01:34.689> drops<00:01:35.140> and<00:01:35.500> these<00:01:36.009> are<00:01:36.280> the

00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:36.759 
TNT charge drops and these are the

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:40.620 
TNT charge drops and these are the
pliers<00:01:37.119> that<00:01:37.509> would<00:01:37.689> auto<00:01:38.259> remote<00:01:38.920> run<00:01:39.630> and

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 
pliers that would auto remote run and

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.429 
pliers that would auto remote run and
here<00:01:41.439> also<00:01:41.770> a<00:01:41.890> deployer<00:01:42.490> and<00:01:43.060> a<00:01:43.240> slap<00:01:43.539> yes<00:01:44.140> and

00:01:44.429 --> 00:01:44.439 
here also a deployer and a slap yes and

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:51.950 
here also a deployer and a slap yes and
this<00:01:44.679> is<00:01:44.799> where<00:01:45.390> you<00:01:46.390> place<00:01:46.780> the<00:01:47.020> week

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:51.960 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:57.190 

see<00:01:52.140> this<00:01:52.710> cannon<00:01:53.400> have<00:01:53.700> no<00:01:54.150> buttons<00:01:55.250> because

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
see this cannon have no buttons because

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.530 
see this cannon have no buttons because
we're<00:01:58.200> isn't<00:01:58.530> technology<00:01:58.920> so<00:01:59.400> that<00:01:59.540> remote

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
we're isn't technology so that remote

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.520 
we're isn't technology so that remote
controls<00:02:01.140> to<00:02:01.380> farm<00:02:01.710> gun<00:02:03.140> with<00:02:04.140> me<00:02:04.320> in<00:02:04.500> my
