battery out in this case the 525 SL
doesn't<00:00:18.770> this<00:00:19.770> unit<00:00:20.640> is<00:00:20.789> probably<00:00:21.740> around<00:00:22.740> 7

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
doesn't this unit is probably around 7

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.910 
doesn't this unit is probably around 7
to<00:00:23.640> 8<00:00:23.730> years<00:00:23.760> old<00:00:24.330> and<00:00:24.600> it's<00:00:24.689> been<00:00:24.869> a<00:00:24.900> great<00:00:25.230> UPS

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
to 8 years old and it's been a great UPS

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.830 
to 8 years old and it's been a great UPS
so<00:00:26.279> that's<00:00:26.490> why<00:00:26.670> I'm<00:00:26.820> actually<00:00:27.000> replacing<00:00:27.750> the

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
so that's why I'm actually replacing the

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.830 
so that's why I'm actually replacing the
battery<00:00:28.170> in<00:00:28.380> it<00:00:29.119> the<00:00:30.119> first<00:00:30.359> thing<00:00:30.570> you<00:00:30.660> want

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
battery in it the first thing you want

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.810 
battery in it the first thing you want
to<00:00:30.869> do<00:00:31.050> is<00:00:31.320> obviously<00:00:31.560> disconnect<00:00:32.550> the<00:00:32.669> AC

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
to do is obviously disconnect the AC

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.410 
to do is obviously disconnect the AC
that<00:00:33.420> is<00:00:33.480> vital<00:00:34.170> the<00:00:34.920> second<00:00:35.340> step<00:00:35.520> is<00:00:35.790> to<00:00:36.030> take

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
that is vital the second step is to take

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.540 
that is vital the second step is to take
a<00:00:36.750> piece<00:00:36.989> of<00:00:37.020> tape<00:00:37.320> and<00:00:37.590> put<00:00:37.680> it<00:00:38.070> over<00:00:38.219> the

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
a piece of tape and put it over the

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.470 
a piece of tape and put it over the
button<00:00:38.850> here<00:00:39.200> and<00:00:40.430> stick<00:00:41.430> it<00:00:41.610> onto<00:00:41.820> the<00:00:42.149> button

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
button here and stick it onto the button

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.510 
button here and stick it onto the button
so<00:00:42.690> it's<00:00:42.840> actually<00:00:43.079> grabbing<00:00:43.829> the<00:00:43.980> button<00:00:44.309> and

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
so it's actually grabbing the button and

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.670 
so it's actually grabbing the button and
the<00:00:45.090> reason<00:00:45.450> is<00:00:45.629> is<00:00:45.809> because<00:00:45.840> the<00:00:46.379> button

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:46.680 
the reason is is because the button

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.260 
the reason is is because the button
actually<00:00:47.039> will<00:00:47.190> fall<00:00:47.399> out<00:00:47.430> at<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:47.879> bottom

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
actually will fall out at the bottom

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.529 
actually will fall out at the bottom
when<00:00:48.480> you<00:00:48.510> take<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:48.930> lid<00:00:49.079> off<00:00:50.329> next<00:00:51.329> there's

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
when you take the lid off next there's

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:54.889 
when you take the lid off next there's
six<00:00:51.899> screws<00:00:52.289> to<00:00:52.860> remove<00:00:53.010> and<00:00:53.579> that<00:00:54.480> will<00:00:54.660> allow

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
six screws to remove and that will allow

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.860 
six screws to remove and that will allow
you<00:00:54.960> to<00:00:55.110> separate<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.860> unit<00:00:56.160> in<00:00:56.280> half<00:00:56.870> to

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
you to separate the unit in half to

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.110 
you to separate the unit in half to
remove<00:00:58.140> the<00:00:58.320> old<00:00:58.500> battery<00:00:58.590> you<00:00:59.430> just<00:00:59.699> simply

BiBi battery and this is a 7.5 amp

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.649

versus<00:01:36.630> a<00:01:36.659> 7<00:01:37.170> amp<00:01:37.380> but<00:01:37.619> this<00:01:37.799> is<00:01:37.979> the<00:01:38.130> same

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:38.659 
versus a 7 amp but this is the same

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:41.390 
versus a 7 amp but this is the same
brand<00:01:39.659> of<00:01:39.930> battery<00:01:40.320> that<00:01:40.409> was<00:01:40.710> included<00:01:41.100> with

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
brand of battery that was included with

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.830 
brand of battery that was included with
the<00:01:41.670> UPS<00:01:42.570> originally<00:01:43.200> and<00:01:43.970> I<00:01:44.970> believe<00:01:45.509> that

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
the UPS originally and I believe that

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.679 
the UPS originally and I believe that
the<00:01:46.140> battery<00:01:46.710> lasts<00:01:47.220> at<00:01:47.340> about<00:01:47.689> somewhere

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
the battery lasts at about somewhere

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.010 
the battery lasts at about somewhere
around<00:01:49.200> five<00:01:49.649> to<00:01:49.890> seven<00:01:50.250> years<00:01:50.520> so<00:01:50.850> it<00:01:51.600> really

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
around five to seven years so it really

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:55.130 
around five to seven years so it really
held<00:01:52.350> up<00:01:52.530> well<00:01:52.770> so<00:01:53.040> I<00:01:53.570> looked<00:01:54.570> for<00:01:54.659> the<00:01:54.899> brand

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
held up well so I looked for the brand

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.100 
held up well so I looked for the brand
of<00:01:55.259> battery<00:01:55.649> that<00:01:55.680> was<00:01:55.920> in<00:01:56.130> the<00:01:56.250> UPS<00:01:56.700> I<00:01:57.110> ordered

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
of battery that was in the UPS I ordered

connected<00:02:10.050> to<00:02:10.440> the<00:02:10.560> battery<00:02:10.709> now<00:02:11.160> it<00:02:11.700> did

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
connected to the battery now it did

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.059 
connected to the battery now it did
spark<00:02:12.270> a<00:02:12.390> little<00:02:12.480> bit<00:02:12.750> when<00:02:12.900> I

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 
spark a little bit when I

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:15.580 
spark a little bit when I
connected<00:02:13.549> the<00:02:13.640> positive<00:02:13.790> lead<00:02:14.590> that's

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
connected the positive lead that's

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:18.220 
connected the positive lead that's
normal<00:02:16.099> just<00:02:16.310> to<00:02:17.030> see<00:02:17.239> the<00:02:17.450> battery<00:02:17.629> into<00:02:18.019> the

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:18.230 
normal just to see the battery into the

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.739 
normal just to see the battery into the
unit<00:02:18.680> and<00:02:18.920> it's<00:02:19.489> a<00:02:19.579> pretty<00:02:19.790> tight<00:02:20.090> fit<00:02:20.359> but<00:02:20.599> it

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:20.749 
unit and it's a pretty tight fit but it

00:02:20.749 --> 00:02:27.039 
unit and it's a pretty tight fit but it
will<00:02:20.900> fit<00:02:21.139> in<00:02:21.260> there<00:02:23.950> and<00:02:24.950> there<00:02:25.219> you<00:02:25.249> go<00:02:26.049> and

00:02:27.039 --> 00:02:27.049 
will fit in there and there you go and

00:02:27.049 --> 00:02:30.509 
will fit in there and there you go and
there's<00:02:27.319> a<00:02:27.379> small<00:02:27.739> grommet<00:02:28.280> that<00:02:28.489> the<00:02:28.969> 110

00:02:30.509 --> 00:02:30.519 
there's a small grommet that the 110

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:34.780 
there's a small grommet that the 110
power<00:02:31.519> cord<00:02:32.180> fits<00:02:32.510> through<00:02:32.889> so<00:02:33.889> I've<00:02:34.310> got<00:02:34.549> that

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 
power cord fits through so I've got that

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:38.199 
power cord fits through so I've got that
back<00:02:35.060> together<00:02:35.269> now<00:02:35.719> and<00:02:36.549> the<00:02:37.549> two<00:02:37.939> halves

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209 
back together now and the two halves

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:41.050 
back together now and the two halves
don't<00:02:38.540> really<00:02:38.959> snap<00:02:39.349> together<00:02:39.919> they<00:02:40.790> just

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
don't really snap together they just

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.059 
don't really snap together they just
kind<00:02:41.239> of<00:02:41.359> fit<00:02:41.540> together<00:02:41.719> and<00:02:42.290> once<00:02:42.829> you<00:02:42.950> get

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:43.069 
kind of fit together and once you get

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:44.679 
kind of fit together and once you get
them<00:02:43.219> close<00:02:43.489> to<00:02:43.760> start<00:02:44.030> putting<00:02:44.299> the<00:02:44.389> screws

00:02:44.679 --> 00:02:44.689 
them close to start putting the screws

00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:46.599 
them close to start putting the screws
in<00:02:44.930> just<00:02:45.650> be<00:02:45.799> careful<00:02:46.280> that<00:02:46.459> you're<00:02:46.579> not

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:46.609 
in just be careful that you're not

00:02:46.609 --> 00:02:48.429 
in just be careful that you're not
pinching<00:02:47.180> any<00:02:47.359> wires<00:02:47.599> they<00:02:47.989> will<00:02:48.200> try<00:02:48.409> to

00:02:48.429 --> 00:02:48.439 
pinching any wires they will try to

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:51.220 
pinching any wires they will try to
sneak<00:02:48.590> out<00:02:49.010> a<00:02:49.040> little<00:02:49.250> bit<00:02:49.549> and<00:02:49.790> also<00:02:50.359> it<00:02:50.750> it<00:02:50.959> is

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
sneak out a little bit and also it it is

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.589 
sneak out a little bit and also it it is
pretty<00:02:51.439> tight<00:02:51.739> on<00:02:51.799> the<00:02:52.099> inside<00:02:52.459> so<00:02:52.819> you<00:02:53.060> might

00:02:53.589 --> 00:02:53.599 
pretty tight on the inside so you might

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:56.530 
pretty tight on the inside so you might
pinch<00:02:54.230> the<00:02:54.889> wires<00:02:55.099> between<00:02:55.819> the<00:02:56.150> circuit

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:56.540 
pinch the wires between the circuit

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:59.110 
pinch the wires between the circuit
boards<00:02:56.840> and<00:02:57.019> things<00:02:57.680> like<00:02:57.980> that<00:02:58.219> so<00:02:58.489> watch<00:02:58.849> out

00:02:59.110 --> 00:02:59.120 
boards and things like that so watch out

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:01.240 
boards and things like that so watch out
for<00:02:59.150> that<00:02:59.359> but<00:03:00.109> I'm<00:03:00.260> basically<00:03:00.560> ready<00:03:00.829> to<00:03:00.980> test

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
for that but I'm basically ready to test

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:13.059 
for that but I'm basically ready to test
the<00:03:01.430> unit<00:03:01.699> all<00:03:02.150> right<00:03:02.359> time<00:03:02.629> to<00:03:02.659> test<00:03:02.959> it<00:03:03.139> out
