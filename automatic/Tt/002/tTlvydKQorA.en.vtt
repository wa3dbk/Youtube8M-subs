that<00:00:23.689> we<00:00:23.810> wouldn't<00:00:24.020> think<00:00:24.290> about<00:00:24.470> putting<00:00:24.739> in

00:00:24.999 --> 00:00:25.009 
that we wouldn't think about putting in

that we wouldn't think about putting in
a<00:00:25.070> basket<00:00:25.460> right<00:00:25.610> I<00:00:25.790> think<00:00:26.029> most<00:00:26.509> people

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:27.700 
a basket right I think most people

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:32.440 
consider annuals the thing to put in
baskets<00:00:30.800> but<00:00:31.040> a<00:00:31.279> lot<00:00:31.790> of<00:00:31.910> problems<00:00:32.300> with

00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:32.450 
baskets but a lot of problems with

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:35.920 
baskets but a lot of problems with
plants<00:00:32.960> is<00:00:33.520> that<00:00:34.520> you<00:00:34.670> dry<00:00:34.910> them<00:00:35.090> out<00:00:35.210> once<00:00:35.570> and

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:35.930

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.320 
about this too is this is shade and we

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.350 
about this too is this is shade and we

all have like the shady areas and

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:42.700 
all have like the shady areas and
sometimes<00:01:41.840> you<00:01:41.960> don't<00:01:42.110> get<00:01:42.200> a<00:01:42.260> lot<00:01:42.380> of<00:01:42.440> bloom

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
the way to fall and you know what's neat

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.900 
the way to fall and you know what's neat
too<00:02:14.960> is<00:02:15.230> who<00:02:15.470> peruse<00:02:15.770> and<00:02:15.950> tear<00:02:16.130> Ella's<00:02:16.520> Hooper

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:16.910 
too is who peruse and tear Ella's Hooper

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:19.030 
too is who peruse and tear Ella's Hooper
Ella's<00:02:17.150> all<00:02:17.330> change<00:02:17.870> colors<00:02:18.500> many<00:02:18.710> of<00:02:18.920> them

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:19.040 
Ella's all change colors many of them

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.040 
Ella's all change colors many of them
change<00:02:19.310> color<00:02:19.610> patterns<00:02:20.120> during<00:02:20.510> the<00:02:20.630> seasons

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:21.050 
change color patterns during the seasons

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.650 
change color patterns during the seasons
too<00:02:21.290> so<00:02:21.620> this<00:02:22.220> looks<00:02:22.550> different<00:02:23.000> from<00:02:23.180> spring

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
too so this looks different from spring

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.380 
too so this looks different from spring
to<00:02:23.690> summer<00:02:24.050> to<00:02:24.320> fall<00:02:24.530> to<00:02:24.830> winter<00:02:25.180> exactly<00:02:26.180> so

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
to summer to fall to winter exactly so

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:27.850 
to summer to fall to winter exactly so
that's<00:02:26.540> another<00:02:26.900> thing<00:02:27.140> so<00:02:27.320> you<00:02:27.410> almost<00:02:27.590> have

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:27.860 
that's another thing so you almost have

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:30.010 
that's another thing so you almost have
like<00:02:27.890> two<00:02:28.460> two<00:02:28.880> or<00:02:29.000> three<00:02:29.180> different<00:02:29.420> kinds<00:02:29.780> of

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.020 
like two two or three different kinds of

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.650 
like two two or three different kinds of
baskets<00:02:30.470> in<00:02:30.770> the<00:02:30.890> same<00:02:31.190> basket<00:02:31.370> that's<00:02:32.150> a<00:02:32.390> very

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 
baskets in the same basket that's a very

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.800 
baskets in the same basket that's a very

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:35.810 
good observation and with all the assets

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.360 
good observation and with all the assets
the<00:02:37.120> drainage<00:02:38.120> has<00:02:38.330> to<00:02:38.480> be<00:02:38.600> very<00:02:38.990> good<00:02:39.290> and<00:02:39.620> you
