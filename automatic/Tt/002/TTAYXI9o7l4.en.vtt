water I can't show you typically speeds

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:44.440 
water I can't show you typically speeds
three<00:03:41.720> four<00:03:42.050> and<00:03:42.230> five<00:03:42.670> because<00:03:43.670> it's<00:03:44.210> got<00:03:44.420> a

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:44.450 
three four and five because it's got a

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:46.480 
three four and five because it's got a
safety<00:03:44.900> feature<00:03:45.140> and<00:03:45.680> it'll<00:03:46.010> just<00:03:46.220> shut<00:03:46.460> off

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:46.490 
safety feature and it'll just shut off

00:03:46.490 --> 00:03:48.790 
safety feature and it'll just shut off
at<00:03:46.970> those<00:03:47.150> speeds<00:03:47.480> when<00:03:48.230> it's<00:03:48.380> out<00:03:48.500> of<00:03:48.530> water

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:48.800

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.820 
at those speeds when it's out of water
but<00:03:49.640> let<00:03:50.480> me<00:03:50.570> just<00:03:50.750> get<00:03:50.900> it<00:03:51.050> running<00:03:51.350> for<00:03:51.620> you

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:51.830 
but let me just get it running for you

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:55.120 
but let me just get it running for you
you<00:03:52.190> can<00:03:52.400> hear<00:03:52.790> how<00:03:53.480> quiet<00:03:53.840> this<00:03:54.380> motor<00:03:54.680> really

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:55.130 
you can hear how quiet this motor really

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:59.710 
you can hear how quiet this motor really
is<00:03:55.310> there's<00:03:55.790> speed<00:03:56.150> 1<00:03:56.860> speed<00:03:57.860> 2

00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720 
is there's speed 1 speed 2

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:03.940 
is there's speed 1 speed 2
speed<00:04:00.530> three<00:04:00.730> and<00:04:01.730> it<00:04:02.180> shuts<00:04:02.480> off<00:04:02.740> it<00:04:03.740> doesn't

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:03.950 
speed three and it shuts off it doesn't

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:05.710 
speed three and it shuts off it doesn't
want<00:04:04.190> to<00:04:04.280> go<00:04:04.400> too<00:04:04.460> fast<00:04:04.880> when<00:04:05.390> it's<00:04:05.540> out<00:04:05.690> of

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:05.720 
want to go too fast when it's out of

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:09.250 
want to go too fast when it's out of
water<00:04:05.990> the<00:04:06.950> reverse<00:04:07.460> speeds<00:04:07.910> it<00:04:08.600> does<00:04:08.840> let<00:04:09.110> me

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:09.260 
water the reverse speeds it does let me

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:11.320 
water the reverse speeds it does let me
get<00:04:09.530> to<00:04:09.740> all<00:04:09.860> the<00:04:10.040> all<00:04:10.250> the<00:04:10.370> way<00:04:10.460> to<00:04:10.520> three<00:04:10.970> so

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:11.330 
get to all the all the way to three so

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:18.449 
get to all the all the way to three so
let's<00:04:11.360> try<00:04:11.750> it<00:04:11.840> out<00:04:12.130> speed<00:04:13.130> one<00:04:15.160> speed<00:04:16.160> two<00:04:16.959> and

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:18.459 
let's try it out speed one speed two and

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:21.550 
let's try it out speed one speed two and
speed<00:04:19.459> three<00:04:20.350> again

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:21.560 
speed three again

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:24.730 
speed three again
shuts<00:04:22.130> off<00:04:22.330> so<00:04:23.330> you<00:04:23.420> can<00:04:23.600> see<00:04:23.810> how<00:04:24.050> quiet<00:04:24.350> this

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740 
shuts off so you can see how quiet this

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:30.340 
shuts off so you can see how quiet this
machine<00:04:25.490> really<00:04:25.730> is<00:04:26.020> it's<00:04:27.020> real<00:04:27.410> smooth<00:04:29.350> and
