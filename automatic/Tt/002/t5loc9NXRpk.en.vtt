00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
you know I talked to you about the brain

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:14.810 
you know I talked to you about the brain
beauty<00:00:13.950> connection<00:00:14.280> because<00:00:14.490> remember<00:00:14.610> the

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:14.820 
beauty connection because remember the

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.160 
beauty connection because remember the
brain<00:00:15.060> is<00:00:15.270> derived<00:00:15.570> from<00:00:15.660> the<00:00:15.780> same<00:00:15.960> kind<00:00:16.139> of

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
brain is derived from the same kind of

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:17.720 
brain is derived from the same kind of
tissue<00:00:16.350> the<00:00:16.680> skin<00:00:16.710> is<00:00:16.950> derived<00:00:17.250> from<00:00:17.340> and

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
tissue the skin is derived from and

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:19.730 
tissue the skin is derived from and
things<00:00:18.390> that<00:00:18.510> work<00:00:18.750> in<00:00:18.869> the<00:00:18.960> brain<00:00:19.170> to<00:00:19.320> help<00:00:19.590> us

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
things that work in the brain to help us

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.830 
things that work in the brain to help us
make<00:00:19.920> the<00:00:20.040> skin<00:00:20.220> look<00:00:20.279> more<00:00:20.520> youthful<00:00:20.700> and<00:00:21.150> DME

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
make the skin look more youthful and DME

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.150 
make the skin look more youthful and DME
works<00:00:22.140> in<00:00:22.260> the<00:00:22.320> brain<00:00:22.470> and<00:00:22.680> it<00:00:22.770> works<00:00:22.950> in<00:00:23.070> the

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
works in the brain and it works in the

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.179 
works in the brain and it works in the
skin<00:00:23.369> and<00:00:23.460> this<00:00:23.580> theme<00:00:24.500> and<00:00:25.500> so<00:00:25.800> interesting

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
skin and this theme and so interesting

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:31.040 
skin and this theme and so interesting
enough<00:00:26.400> I<00:00:27.140> met<00:00:28.140> a<00:00:28.170> physician<00:00:28.710> in<00:00:29.580> UK<00:00:30.539> London

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
enough I met a physician in UK London

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.729 
enough I met a physician in UK London
who<00:00:31.740> was<00:00:31.860> using<00:00:32.070> infrared<00:00:32.640> frequency<00:00:33.650> at<00:00:34.650> the

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
who was using infrared frequency at the

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.799 
who was using infrared frequency at the
same<00:00:35.129> frequency<00:00:35.370> that's<00:00:35.940> repairing<00:00:36.690> your

00:00:36.799 --> 00:00:36.809 
same frequency that's repairing your

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:39.979 
same frequency that's repairing your
skin<00:00:37.050> and<00:00:37.290> he's<00:00:38.070> and<00:00:38.760> he's<00:00:38.910> looking<00:00:39.300> at<00:00:39.449> it<00:00:39.600> in

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
skin and he's and he's looking at it in

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:43.250 
skin and he's and he's looking at it in
terms<00:00:40.170> of<00:00:40.350> helping<00:00:40.879> brain<00:00:41.879> tissue<00:00:42.120> and<00:00:43.050> so<00:00:43.170> we

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
terms of helping brain tissue and so we

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:44.630 
terms of helping brain tissue and so we
talked<00:00:43.500> and<00:00:43.710> I<00:00:43.770> talked<00:00:44.040> about<00:00:44.220> the<00:00:44.340> fact<00:00:44.489> that

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
talked and I talked about the fact that

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.220 
talked and I talked about the fact that
the<00:00:44.700> brain<00:00:44.850> beauty<00:00:45.180> connection<00:00:45.570> and<00:00:45.989> he<00:00:46.050> told

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
the brain beauty connection and he told

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.720 
the brain beauty connection and he told
me<00:00:46.320> about<00:00:46.410> some<00:00:46.530> fascinating<00:00:47.100> studies<00:00:47.520> he<00:00:47.640> was

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
me about some fascinating studies he was

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:50.960 
me about some fascinating studies he was
doing<00:00:47.970> he<00:00:48.930> originally<00:00:49.890> found<00:00:50.370> that<00:00:50.640> he<00:00:50.760> felt

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:50.970 
doing he originally found that he felt

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:52.130 
doing he originally found that he felt
that<00:00:51.149> this<00:00:51.239> infrared<00:00:51.630> light<00:00:51.899> of<00:00:52.020> this

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
that this infrared light of this

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.049 
that this infrared light of this
frequency<00:00:52.440> could<00:00:52.680> help<00:00:52.860> repair<00:00:53.160> brain<00:00:53.399> so<00:00:53.970> he

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
frequency could help repair brain so he

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.930 
frequency could help repair brain so he
took<00:00:54.239> some<00:00:54.809> mice<00:00:55.050> that<00:00:55.290> were<00:00:55.320> aged<00:00:55.620> and<00:00:56.219> when

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
took some mice that were aged and when

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.549 
took some mice that were aged and when
you<00:00:57.000> might<00:00:57.149> sir<00:00:57.300> older<00:00:57.630> they<00:00:57.750> very<00:00:58.260> much<00:00:58.290> like

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
you might sir older they very much like

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.229 
you might sir older they very much like
us<00:00:58.590> they<00:00:58.920> kind<00:00:59.130> of<00:00:59.160> lose<00:00:59.340> their<00:00:59.489> memories<00:00:59.790> and

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
us they kind of lose their memories and

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.720 
us they kind of lose their memories and
the<00:01:00.510> way<00:01:00.600> they<00:01:00.719> test<00:01:00.960> mice<00:01:01.219> is<00:01:02.219> to<00:01:02.370> put<00:01:02.520> them<00:01:02.610> in

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
the way they test mice is to put them in

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.490 
the way they test mice is to put them in
a<00:01:02.790> maze<00:01:02.940> and<00:01:03.270> see<00:01:03.780> if<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:03.930> mods<00:01:04.140> will<00:01:04.290> remember

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
a maze and see if the mods will remember

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.190 
a maze and see if the mods will remember
the<00:01:04.739> maze<00:01:04.890> to<00:01:05.100> get<00:01:05.220> to<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.460> food<00:01:05.610> and<00:01:06.240> when<00:01:07.140> the

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:07.200 
the maze to get to the food and when the

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.870 
the maze to get to the food and when the
wife's<00:01:07.380> her<00:01:07.500> age<00:01:07.680> they<00:01:08.190> can<00:01:08.369> no<00:01:08.460> longer<00:01:08.670> run

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
wife's her age they can no longer run

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:09.950 
wife's her age they can no longer run
the<00:01:09.030> maze<00:01:09.180> because<00:01:09.450> they<00:01:09.539> can't<00:01:09.750> remember

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960 
the maze because they can't remember

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:11.210 
the maze because they can't remember
where<00:01:10.170> they're<00:01:10.320> going<00:01:10.560> pretty<00:01:10.800> much<00:01:10.920> like<00:01:10.979> me

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
where they're going pretty much like me

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.290 
where they're going pretty much like me
in<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.340> morning<00:01:11.580> trying<00:01:11.729> to<00:01:11.789> find<00:01:11.910> my<00:01:12.090> keys

day a couple of things who were

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:27.830 
day a couple of things who were
remarkable<00:01:26.400> number<00:01:26.610> one<00:01:26.790> they<00:01:27.510> wanted<00:01:27.780> to

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
remarkable number one they wanted to

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:28.880 
remarkable number one they wanted to
kick<00:01:28.020> him<00:01:28.110> out<00:01:28.200> of<00:01:28.260> the<00:01:28.320> university<00:01:28.740> because

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
kick him out of the university because

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.050 
kick him out of the university because
he's<00:01:29.040> putting<00:01:29.220> a<00:01:29.310> little<00:01:29.400> helmet<00:01:29.610> son<00:01:29.880> likes

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
he's putting a little helmet son likes

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.080 
he's putting a little helmet son likes
and<00:01:30.560> secondly<00:01:31.580> he<00:01:32.580> saw<00:01:32.790> some<00:01:32.970> dramatic

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
and secondly he saw some dramatic

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.719 
and secondly he saw some dramatic
effects<00:01:33.600> in<00:01:33.780> two<00:01:33.990> weeks<00:01:34.229> these<00:01:35.159> mice<00:01:35.400> after

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
effects in two weeks these mice after

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:37.160 
effects in two weeks these mice after
just<00:01:36.090> five<00:01:36.270> minutes<00:01:36.450> twice<00:01:36.810> a<00:01:36.869> day<00:01:37.020> of

now run the maze better than the young
lives<00:01:40.920> the<00:01:41.340> memories<00:01:41.700> came<00:01:41.850> back<00:01:42.350> and<00:01:43.350> so<00:01:43.650> he

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
lives the memories came back and so he

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.130

lungs can help our heart can to help
organ<00:02:35.769> systems<00:02:36.129> and<00:02:36.640> so<00:02:37.239> we're<00:02:37.870> getting<00:02:38.019> there

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
organ systems and so we're getting there

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:39.899 
organ systems and so we're getting there
and<00:02:38.469> we'll<00:02:39.099> we'll<00:02:39.219> be<00:02:39.340> stepping<00:02:39.700> into<00:02:39.760> a

00:02:39.899 --> 00:02:39.909 
and we'll we'll be stepping into a

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:42.149 
and we'll we'll be stepping into a
capsule<00:02:40.150> someday<00:02:40.629> soon<00:02:40.900> with<00:02:41.590> this<00:02:41.739> warm

00:02:42.149 --> 00:02:42.159 
capsule someday soon with this warm

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:43.470 
capsule someday soon with this warm
light<00:02:42.219> I<00:02:42.549> really<00:02:42.760> do<00:02:42.879> think<00:02:43.030> so

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
light I really do think so

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.539 
light I really do think so
are<00:02:44.200> there<00:02:44.409> any<00:02:44.500> some<00:02:44.739> negative<00:02:45.129> side<00:02:45.280> effects

00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:45.549 
are there any some negative side effects

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:46.649 
are there any some negative side effects
we<00:02:45.670> shouldn't<00:02:45.909> light<00:02:46.030> none<00:02:46.420> whatsoever

00:02:46.649 --> 00:02:46.659 
we shouldn't light none whatsoever

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:48.539 
we shouldn't light none whatsoever
because<00:02:47.379> it's<00:02:47.560> just<00:02:47.769> LED<00:02:48.159> light<00:02:48.340> it's<00:02:48.489> not

00:02:48.539 --> 00:02:48.549 
because it's just LED light it's not

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:51.390 
because it's just LED light it's not
laser<00:02:48.849> light<00:02:49.150> it's<00:02:49.989> a<00:02:50.049> very<00:02:50.290> low<00:02:50.469> dose<00:02:50.680> and

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
laser light it's a very low dose and

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:52.920 
laser light it's a very low dose and
this<00:02:51.730> seemed<00:02:51.879> to<00:02:51.939> be<00:02:51.969> helping<00:02:52.150> everything<00:02:52.689> so

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:52.930 
this seemed to be helping everything so

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:57.389 
this seemed to be helping everything so
that's<00:02:53.530> the<00:02:53.680> excitement<00:02:53.980> of<00:02:54.250> this<00:02:55.150> treatment
