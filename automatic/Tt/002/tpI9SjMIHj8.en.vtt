the power filter on this tank recently

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:06.190 
the power filter on this tank recently
has<00:00:03.870> started<00:00:04.170> to<00:00:04.290> make<00:00:04.460> pretty<00:00:05.460> loud<00:00:05.700> noise

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:06.200

tank this is an aqua clear 70 I really

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:27.929 
tank this is an aqua clear 70 I really
like<00:00:26.020> these<00:00:26.169> aqua<00:00:26.500> clear<00:00:26.740> filters<00:00:27.189> they<00:00:27.820> have

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:27.939 
like these aqua clear filters they have

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:29.999 
like these aqua clear filters they have
a<00:00:28.000> nice<00:00:28.210> big<00:00:28.540> media<00:00:29.140> compartment<00:00:29.770> that<00:00:29.950> is

00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:30.009 
a nice big media compartment that is

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:32.910 
a nice big media compartment that is
very<00:00:30.939> versatile<00:00:31.509> way<00:00:31.989> more<00:00:32.230> versatile<00:00:32.680> than

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:36.160 
power filters that have the like

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:38.220 
power filters that have the like
all-in-one<00:00:36.760> kind<00:00:37.030> of<00:00:37.120> cartridge<00:00:37.540> which<00:00:38.110> are

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:38.230 
all-in-one kind of cartridge which are

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:39.720 
all-in-one kind of cartridge which are
convenient<00:00:38.559> but<00:00:38.860> you<00:00:39.190> don't<00:00:39.340> have<00:00:39.489> as<00:00:39.610> much

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:39.730 
convenient but you don't have as much

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:41.430 
convenient but you don't have as much
flexibility<00:00:40.390> in<00:00:40.510> what<00:00:40.630> you<00:00:40.780> put<00:00:41.020> in<00:00:41.260> the

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:41.440 
flexibility in what you put in the

filter these filters also generally are

filter these filters also generally are
very<00:00:45.519> quiet<00:00:46.510> and<00:00:48.059> don't<00:00:49.059> require<00:00:49.239> a<00:00:49.449> whole<00:00:49.570> lot

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:49.780 
very quiet and don't require a whole lot

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.200 
very quiet and don't require a whole lot
of<00:00:49.870> maintenance<00:00:50.050> but<00:00:50.829> sometimes<00:00:51.309> they<00:00:52.149> do

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:52.210 
of maintenance but sometimes they do

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.069 
of maintenance but sometimes they do
start<00:00:52.570> to<00:00:52.690> make<00:00:52.839> noise<00:00:53.109> all<00:00:53.469> power<00:00:53.739> filters

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
start to make noise all power filters

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.569 
start to make noise all power filters
can<00:00:56.079> start<00:00:56.350> to<00:00:56.440> make<00:00:56.530> noise<00:00:56.739> after<00:00:56.980> a<00:00:57.280> while

00:00:57.569 --> 00:00:57.579 
can start to make noise after a while

00:00:57.579 --> 00:00:59.669 
can start to make noise after a while
and<00:00:57.999> I've<00:00:58.179> noticed<00:00:58.390> it's<00:00:58.719> particularly<00:00:59.379> a

00:00:59.669 --> 00:00:59.679 
and I've noticed it's particularly a

00:00:59.679 --> 00:01:03.959 
and I've noticed it's particularly a
problem<00:00:59.800> in<00:01:00.489> tanks<00:01:01.120> with<00:01:02.429> sand<00:01:03.429> substrates

00:01:03.959 --> 00:01:03.969 
problem in tanks with sand substrates

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:07.950 
problem in tanks with sand substrates
that<00:01:04.120> tend<00:01:04.449> to<00:01:04.480> get<00:01:05.070> stirred<00:01:06.070> up<00:01:06.280> a<00:01:06.460> lot<00:01:06.960> which

simply<00:01:23.610> twist<00:01:24.610> it<00:01:24.880> off<00:01:26.370> while<00:01:27.370> you<00:01:27.520> have<00:01:27.670> it

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:27.760 
simply twist it off while you have it

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:29.700 
simply twist it off while you have it
off<00:01:27.880> it's<00:01:28.060> a<00:01:28.120> good<00:01:28.240> idea<00:01:28.330> to<00:01:28.570> check<00:01:29.290> out<00:01:29.470> the

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:29.710 
off it's a good idea to check out the

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:32.760 
off it's a good idea to check out the

dried<00:01:36.130> out<00:01:36.160> and<00:01:36.430> cracked<00:01:37.260> it's<00:01:38.260> an<00:01:38.350> easy<00:01:38.470> fix

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:38.770 
dried out and cracked it's an easy fix

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.470 
dried out and cracked it's an easy fix
you<00:01:38.980> can<00:01:39.070> get<00:01:39.160> a<00:01:39.190> new<00:01:39.370> over<00:01:39.670> and<00:01:39.790> pop<00:01:40.000> it<00:01:40.120> on<00:01:40.180> no

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:40.480 
you can get a new over and pop it on no

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:42.390 
you can get a new over and pop it on no
problem<00:01:40.870> it's<00:01:41.590> a<00:01:41.650> good<00:01:41.770> idea<00:01:41.860> to<00:01:42.040> check<00:01:42.250> them

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:42.400 
problem it's a good idea to check them

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.510 
problem it's a good idea to check them
out<00:01:42.490> they<00:01:42.730> do<00:01:42.790> last<00:01:43.240> a<00:01:43.450> long<00:01:43.600> time<00:01:44.220> ten<00:01:45.220> years

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:45.520 
out they do last a long time ten years

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.250 
out they do last a long time ten years
or<00:01:45.730> more<00:01:45.760> if<00:01:46.150> it's<00:01:46.330> on<00:01:46.480> a<00:01:46.510> fresh<00:01:46.750> water<00:01:46.960> tank

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:47.260 
or more if it's on a fresh water tank

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:48.900 
or more if it's on a fresh water tank
maybe<00:01:47.530> a<00:01:47.620> little<00:01:47.830> less<00:01:47.980> on<00:01:48.160> a<00:01:48.190> saltwater<00:01:48.490> tank

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:48.910 
maybe a little less on a saltwater tank

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:50.940 
maybe a little less on a saltwater tank
but<00:01:49.720> it's<00:01:50.110> good<00:01:50.230> idea<00:01:50.440> to<00:01:50.530> check<00:01:50.680> them<00:01:50.830> out

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:50.950 
but it's good idea to check them out

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:55.020 
but it's good idea to check them out
while<00:01:51.310> you<00:01:51.460> have<00:01:51.610> it<00:01:51.730> off<00:01:53.640> what<00:01:54.640> happens<00:01:54.940> the

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:55.030 
while you have it off what happens the

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.530 
while you have it off what happens the
sand<00:01:55.330> can<00:01:55.540> get<00:01:55.740> into<00:01:56.740> the<00:01:56.830> filter<00:01:57.220> and<00:01:57.540> gets

00:01:58.530 --> 00:01:58.540 
sand can get into the filter and gets

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:01.350 
sand can get into the filter and gets
them<00:01:58.720> down<00:01:58.900> in<00:01:59.110> there<00:01:59.350> and<00:01:59.970> can<00:02:00.970> cause<00:02:01.150> some

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:01.360 
them down in there and can cause some

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.570 
them down in there and can cause some
problems<00:02:01.390> with<00:02:01.840> the<00:02:01.930> in<00:02:01.990> power<00:02:02.580> sometimes

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:03.580 
problems with the in power sometimes

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:05.270 
problems with the in power sometimes
these<00:02:03.820> things<00:02:04.000> are<00:02:04.120> just<00:02:04.150> really<00:02:04.450> gunked-up

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
these things are just really gunked-up

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.180 
these things are just really gunked-up
they're<00:02:06.280> coding<00:02:06.640> in<00:02:06.990> diatoms<00:02:07.990> or<00:02:08.289> algae<00:02:08.739> or

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
they're coding in diatoms or algae or

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.380 
they're coding in diatoms or algae or
just<00:02:09.459> some<00:02:09.789> ohm<00:02:10.060> and<00:02:10.330> that<00:02:10.989> can<00:02:11.170> cause<00:02:12.390> the

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
just some ohm and that can cause the

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.320 
just some ohm and that can cause the
impeller<00:02:13.690> of<00:02:13.900> the<00:02:14.200> function<00:02:15.040> improperly<00:02:15.730> so

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
impeller of the function improperly so

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.479 
impeller of the function improperly so
just<00:02:16.840> a<00:02:16.900> cleaning<00:02:17.379> out<00:02:17.560> of<00:02:17.890> the<00:02:18.010> impeller<00:02:18.340> and

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:18.489 
just a cleaning out of the impeller and

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:21.270 
just a cleaning out of the impeller and
the<00:02:18.790> motor<00:02:19.360> housing<00:02:19.629> is<00:02:20.409> often<00:02:20.739> enough<00:02:20.950> to<00:02:21.129> get

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:21.280 
the motor housing is often enough to get

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.790 
the motor housing is often enough to get
these<00:02:21.370> things<00:02:21.640> working

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
these things working

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.650 
these things working
these<00:02:23.490> here's<00:02:23.760> the<00:02:23.880> impeller<00:02:24.150> you<00:02:24.330> can<00:02:24.480> pull

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
these here's the impeller you can pull

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:28.190 
these here's the impeller you can pull
it<00:02:24.780> right<00:02:24.810> out<00:02:25.820> you<00:02:26.820> want<00:02:27.120> to<00:02:27.210> clean<00:02:27.450> in<00:02:27.690> there

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
it right out you want to clean in there

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.330 
it right out you want to clean in there
nice<00:02:28.440> and<00:02:28.470> good<00:02:29.330> what<00:02:30.330> you<00:02:30.420> can<00:02:30.570> see<00:02:31.190> is<00:02:32.190> this

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:32.340 
nice and good what you can see is this

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.620 
nice and good what you can see is this
impeller<00:02:33.320> has<00:02:34.790> ridges<00:02:35.790> that<00:02:35.820> have<00:02:36.120> formed

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
impeller has ridges that have formed

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.360 
impeller has ridges that have formed
from<00:02:36.690> sand<00:02:37.410> particles<00:02:37.890> getting<00:02:38.070> in<00:02:38.220> here

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:38.370 
from sand particles getting in here

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:40.010 
from sand particles getting in here
spinning<00:02:38.670> around<00:02:38.820> and<00:02:39.180> wearing<00:02:39.510> out<00:02:39.720> this

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020 
spinning around and wearing out this

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:47.240 
spinning around and wearing out this
magnet<00:02:40.760> part<00:02:43.580> what<00:02:44.580> happens<00:02:45.030> is<00:02:45.780> that<00:02:46.260> it's

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
magnet part what happens is that it's

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.400 
magnet part what happens is that it's
wears<00:02:47.580> away<00:02:47.790> the<00:02:48.030> magnet<00:02:48.480> so<00:02:49.080> it<00:02:49.140> makes<00:02:49.290> it

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
wears away the magnet so it makes it

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:52.570 
wears away the magnet so it makes it
less<00:02:49.530> powerful<00:02:50.040> and<00:02:50.220> it<00:02:50.940> makes<00:02:51.180> the<00:02:51.570> impeller

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:52.580 
less powerful and it makes the impeller

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:55.640 
less powerful and it makes the impeller
imbalanced<00:02:53.580> and<00:02:53.700> it<00:02:54.540> rattles<00:02:55.020> around<00:02:55.170> inside

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
imbalanced and it rattles around inside

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.890 
imbalanced and it rattles around inside
the<00:02:55.830> motor<00:02:56.010> housing<00:02:56.160> and<00:02:56.640> causes<00:02:57.630> lots<00:02:57.780> of

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
the motor housing and causes lots of

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:04.850 
the motor housing and causes lots of
noise<00:02:58.050> so<00:02:59.660> I<00:03:00.660> have<00:03:01.110> a<00:03:01.250> new<00:03:02.250> impeller<00:03:03.710> and<00:03:04.710> this

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:04.860 
noise so I have a new impeller and this

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.810 
noise so I have a new impeller and this
up<00:03:05.630> magnets<00:03:06.630> are<00:03:06.720> thrashing<00:03:07.170> together<00:03:07.820> the

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.820 
up magnets are thrashing together the

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:12.080 
up magnets are thrashing together the
old<00:03:08.970> one<00:03:09.770> with<00:03:10.770> the<00:03:11.310> ridges<00:03:11.790> you<00:03:11.820> can

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
old one with the ridges you can

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.380 
old one with the ridges you can
definitely<00:03:12.540> feel<00:03:12.810> them<00:03:13.310> the<00:03:14.310> new<00:03:14.520> one<00:03:14.730> nice

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:15.390 
definitely feel them the new one nice

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:21.440 
definitely feel them the new one nice
and<00:03:15.750> smooth<00:03:16.020> magnet<00:03:18.200> so<00:03:19.200> I<00:03:20.160> had<00:03:21.090> to<00:03:21.210> get<00:03:21.330> this

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
and smooth magnet so I had to get this

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:24.110 
and smooth magnet so I had to get this
online<00:03:21.870> I<00:03:22.620> have<00:03:23.250> seen<00:03:23.520> up<00:03:23.610> in<00:03:23.700> pet<00:03:23.880> stores

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
online I have seen up in pet stores

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.940 
online I have seen up in pet stores
before<00:03:24.420> but<00:03:24.570> I<00:03:24.600> couldn't<00:03:24.840> find<00:03:24.990> one<00:03:25.260> around

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
before but I couldn't find one around

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.090 
before but I couldn't find one around
here<00:03:26.340> so<00:03:26.730> I<00:03:26.790> got<00:03:26.940> it<00:03:27.030> online<00:03:27.150> and<00:03:27.950> simply<00:03:28.950> just

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:29.100 
here so I got it online and simply just

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:35.740 
here so I got it online and simply just
slide<00:03:29.550> it<00:03:29.700> back<00:03:29.850> on<00:03:30.120> to<00:03:30.330> the<00:03:30.510> shaft<00:03:31.489> like<00:03:32.489> that

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:35.750 

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.170 

it<00:03:36.200> spins<00:03:36.410> pretty<00:03:36.590> well<00:03:36.830> we'll<00:03:37.580> put<00:03:37.760> this<00:03:37.940> back

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:38.180 
it spins pretty well we'll put this back

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.630 
it spins pretty well we'll put this back
on<00:03:38.480> the<00:03:38.630> power<00:03:38.810> filter<00:03:39.290> and<00:03:39.500> get<00:03:40.250> it<00:03:40.340> back<00:03:40.460> on

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:40.640 
on the power filter and get it back on

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.640 
on the power filter and get it back on
the<00:03:40.730> tank<00:03:40.970> so<00:03:41.660> to<00:03:41.720> put<00:03:41.900> the<00:03:42.020> motor<00:03:42.440> housing

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:42.650 
the tank so to put the motor housing

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:45.640 
the tank so to put the motor housing
back<00:03:43.010> on<00:03:43.480> have<00:03:44.480> it<00:03:44.510> oriented<00:03:44.870> like<00:03:45.200> that<00:03:45.440> with

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:45.650 
back on have it oriented like that with

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:51.160 
back on have it oriented like that with
the<00:03:45.770> tab<00:03:46.120> pointing<00:03:47.120> inwards<00:03:47.680> push<00:03:48.680> it<00:03:48.800> up<00:03:50.170> spin

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:51.170 
the tab pointing inwards push it up spin

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:55.090 
the tab pointing inwards push it up spin
it<00:03:51.290> to<00:03:51.470> lock<00:03:51.620> it<00:03:51.770> into<00:03:51.890> place<00:03:52.070> like<00:03:52.400> that<00:03:54.100> I'll

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:55.100 
it to lock it into place like that I'll

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:56.650 
it to lock it into place like that I'll
put<00:03:55.280> the<00:03:55.370> tube<00:03:55.580> back<00:03:55.730> on<00:03:55.970> fill<00:03:56.330> back<00:03:56.510> with

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:56.660 
put the tube back on fill back with

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:59.170 
put the tube back on fill back with
water<00:03:56.870> put<00:03:57.140> on<00:03:57.260> the<00:03:57.350> tank<00:03:57.590> and<00:03:57.830> fire<00:03:58.820> it<00:03:58.940> up<00:03:59.030> and

00:03:59.170 --> 00:03:59.180 
water put on the tank and fire it up and

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:01.960 
water put on the tank and fire it up and
see<00:03:59.480> how<00:04:00.110> it<00:04:00.230> sounds<00:04:00.430> I've<00:04:01.430> got<00:04:01.640> the<00:04:01.730> filter

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:01.970 
see how it sounds I've got the filter

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:05.050 
see how it sounds I've got the filter
back<00:04:02.270> on<00:04:02.450> the<00:04:02.570> tank<00:04:02.900> but<00:04:03.620> it's<00:04:04.520> still<00:04:04.850> really

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:05.060 
back on the tank but it's still really

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:08.140 
back on the tank but it's still really
loud<00:04:05.420> so<00:04:05.900> I<00:04:06.320> think<00:04:06.590> it's<00:04:06.860> the<00:04:06.980> motor<00:04:07.250> itself

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:08.150 
loud so I think it's the motor itself

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:10.060 
loud so I think it's the motor itself
that<00:04:08.570> is<00:04:08.810> the<00:04:09.080> problem<00:04:09.470> so<00:04:09.650> I'm<00:04:09.709> going<00:04:09.830> to<00:04:09.890> pull

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:10.070 
that is the problem so I'm going to pull

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:12.430 
that is the problem so I'm going to pull
this<00:04:10.160> thing<00:04:10.310> back<00:04:10.550> off<00:04:10.790> and<00:04:11.780> replace<00:04:12.170> it<00:04:12.320> with

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:12.440 
this thing back off and replace it with

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.710 
this thing back off and replace it with
another<00:04:12.470> motor<00:04:12.950> and<00:04:13.250> see<00:04:14.000> if<00:04:14.090> that<00:04:14.300> doesn't

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:14.720 
another motor and see if that doesn't

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.020 
another motor and see if that doesn't
fix<00:04:14.870> the<00:04:14.959> problem<00:04:15.130> okay<00:04:16.130> inside<00:04:16.519> this<00:04:16.730> motor

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:17.030 
fix the problem okay inside this motor

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:19.810 
fix the problem okay inside this motor
there's<00:04:17.989> an<00:04:18.290> an<00:04:18.500> axle<00:04:19.190> that<00:04:19.370> you<00:04:19.459> can<00:04:19.579> pull<00:04:19.790> out

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:19.820 
there's an an axle that you can pull out

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:21.970 
there's an an axle that you can pull out
with<00:04:20.299> the<00:04:20.419> pliers<00:04:20.660> it's<00:04:21.530> in<00:04:21.680> there<00:04:21.799> pretty

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:21.980 
with the pliers it's in there pretty

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:25.840 
with the pliers it's in there pretty
good<00:04:22.270> and<00:04:23.270> then<00:04:23.419> the<00:04:24.010> the<00:04:25.010> impeller<00:04:25.400> slides

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:25.850 
good and then the the impeller slides

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:29.620 
good and then the the impeller slides
and<00:04:26.290> then<00:04:27.290> spins<00:04:27.740> on<00:04:28.040> this<00:04:28.280> axle<00:04:28.910> well<00:04:29.450> this

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:29.630 
and then spins on this axle well this

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:33.310 
and then spins on this axle well this
axle<00:04:30.140> on<00:04:30.230> this<00:04:30.440> noisy<00:04:30.860> filter<00:04:31.280> I<00:04:32.050> hope<00:04:33.050> you<00:04:33.169> can

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:33.320 
axle on this noisy filter I hope you can

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:36.040 
axle on this noisy filter I hope you can
see<00:04:33.590> this<00:04:34.370> whole<00:04:34.640> region<00:04:34.820> here<00:04:35.030> is<00:04:35.419> worn<00:04:35.780> out

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.050 
see this whole region here is worn out

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:37.720 
see this whole region here is worn out
there<00:04:36.530> are<00:04:36.650> grooves<00:04:36.950> in<00:04:37.220> there<00:04:37.430> and

00:04:37.720 --> 00:04:37.730 
there are grooves in there and

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:42.969 
there are grooves in there and
everything<00:04:38.510> and<00:04:39.500> then<00:04:39.979> if<00:04:40.250> I<00:04:40.370> spin<00:04:40.729> this<00:04:41.979> and

00:04:42.969 --> 00:04:42.979 
everything and then if I spin this and

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:44.860 
everything and then if I spin this and
if<00:04:43.070> you<00:04:43.160> can<00:04:43.310> see<00:04:43.520> this<00:04:43.669> or<00:04:43.850> not<00:04:43.880> but<00:04:44.390> this<00:04:44.630> end

00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:44.870 
if you can see this or not but this end

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:49.110 
if you can see this or not but this end
especially<00:04:45.229> is<00:04:45.800> not<00:04:46.660> worn<00:04:47.660> out<00:04:47.810> evenly<00:04:48.260> it's

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:49.120 
especially is not worn out evenly it's

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.820 
especially is not worn out evenly it's
one<00:04:50.120> side<00:04:50.390> is<00:04:50.570> much<00:04:50.750> more<00:04:50.960> worn<00:04:51.200> out<00:04:51.320> than<00:04:51.380> the

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:51.830 
one side is much more worn out than the

00:04:51.830 --> 00:04:54.219 
one side is much more worn out than the
other<00:04:51.979> side<00:04:52.310> and<00:04:52.610> I<00:04:53.300> think<00:04:53.570> that<00:04:53.750> is<00:04:53.990> what's

00:04:54.219 --> 00:04:54.229 
other side and I think that is what's

00:04:54.229 --> 00:04:57.969 
other side and I think that is what's
really<00:04:54.590> causing<00:04:54.919> the<00:04:55.430> problem<00:04:56.650> the<00:04:57.650> impeller

00:04:57.969 --> 00:04:57.979 
really causing the problem the impeller

00:04:57.979 --> 00:05:00.490 
really causing the problem the impeller
is<00:04:58.220> sitting<00:04:58.460> on<00:04:58.580> this<00:04:58.820> and<00:04:59.030> it's<00:04:59.630> not<00:04:59.840> rotating

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:00.500 
is sitting on this and it's not rotating

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:03.940 
is sitting on this and it's not rotating
on<00:05:00.979> a<00:05:01.010> nice<00:05:01.340> even<00:05:01.880> smooth<00:05:02.270> axle<00:05:02.840> it's<00:05:03.500> rattling

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:03.950 
on a nice even smooth axle it's rattling

00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:05.890 
on a nice even smooth axle it's rattling
around<00:05:04.280> and<00:05:04.550> making<00:05:04.729> all<00:05:05.030> sorts<00:05:05.210> of<00:05:05.390> noise<00:05:05.450> so

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:05.900 
around and making all sorts of noise so

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:09.570 
around and making all sorts of noise so
it's<00:05:06.860> this<00:05:07.160> that<00:05:07.430> needs<00:05:07.669> to<00:05:07.760> be<00:05:07.790> replaced

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:09.580 
it's this that needs to be replaced

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:12.340 
it's this that needs to be replaced
which<00:05:10.580> can't<00:05:11.450> just<00:05:11.630> buy<00:05:11.780> these<00:05:11.840> separately

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:12.350 
which can't just buy these separately

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:15.040 
which can't just buy these separately
you<00:05:12.650> gotta<00:05:12.860> they<00:05:13.250> come<00:05:13.490> with<00:05:13.760> the<00:05:14.060> motor<00:05:14.300> so<00:05:15.020> I

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:15.050 
you gotta they come with the motor so I

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:17.230 
you gotta they come with the motor so I
might<00:05:15.169> have<00:05:15.260> to<00:05:15.350> buy<00:05:15.470> a<00:05:15.500> new<00:05:15.680> motor<00:05:16.060> to<00:05:17.060> look

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:17.240 
might have to buy a new motor to look

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:19.000 
might have to buy a new motor to look
through<00:05:17.450> my<00:05:17.479> parts<00:05:17.900> and<00:05:18.050> see<00:05:18.200> maybe<00:05:18.440> I<00:05:18.770> might

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:19.010 
through my parts and see maybe I might

00:05:19.010 --> 00:05:23.050 
through my parts and see maybe I might
have<00:05:19.040> another<00:05:19.340> axle<00:05:19.820> that<00:05:20.630> I<00:05:20.660> can<00:05:20.870> replace<00:05:22.060> but

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:23.060 
have another axle that I can replace but

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:25.030 
have another axle that I can replace but
I<00:05:23.090> think<00:05:23.330> this<00:05:23.570> is<00:05:23.870> the<00:05:24.200> root<00:05:24.410> of<00:05:24.560> the<00:05:24.650> problem

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:25.040 
I think this is the root of the problem

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:27.190 
I think this is the root of the problem
although<00:05:25.250> the<00:05:25.370> old<00:05:25.580> impeller<00:05:26.000> was<00:05:26.300> was<00:05:26.870> pretty

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:27.200 
although the old impeller was was pretty

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:30.550 
although the old impeller was was pretty
bad<00:05:27.440> off<00:05:27.680> so<00:05:28.220> I<00:05:28.460> got<00:05:28.700> a<00:05:28.729> new<00:05:28.910> motor<00:05:29.320> you<00:05:30.320> can<00:05:30.350> go

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:30.560 
bad off so I got a new motor you can go

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:33.219 
bad off so I got a new motor you can go
out<00:05:30.650> and<00:05:30.740> buy<00:05:30.950> these<00:05:31.010> motors<00:05:31.690> separately<00:05:32.690> or

00:05:33.219 --> 00:05:33.229 
out and buy these motors separately or

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:36.010 
out and buy these motors separately or
you<00:05:33.440> can<00:05:33.590> do<00:05:33.710> what<00:05:33.830> I<00:05:33.950> did<00:05:34.010> and<00:05:34.430> get<00:05:35.120> one<00:05:35.360> from<00:05:35.840> a

00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:36.020 
you can do what I did and get one from a

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:39.700 
you can do what I did and get one from a
different<00:05:36.410> aqua<00:05:36.890> clear<00:05:37.040> model<00:05:37.720> because<00:05:38.720> all

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:39.710 
different aqua clear model because all

00:05:39.710 --> 00:05:42.490 
different aqua clear model because all
these<00:05:39.919> aqua<00:05:40.310> Clare's<00:05:40.580> the<00:05:40.850> aqua<00:05:41.240> color<00:05:41.330> 20<00:05:41.840> 30

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:42.500 
these aqua Clare's the aqua color 20 30

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:46.020 
these aqua Clare's the aqua color 20 30
50<00:05:43.190> and<00:05:43.220> 70<00:05:43.880> and<00:05:44.120> maybe<00:05:44.390> even<00:05:44.630> the<00:05:45.020> 90<00:05:45.590> I'm<00:05:45.710> not

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:46.030 
50 and 70 and maybe even the 90 I'm not

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:49.710 
50 and 70 and maybe even the 90 I'm not
though<00:05:46.240> all<00:05:46.840> use<00:05:47.680> the<00:05:47.950> same<00:05:47.980> motor<00:05:48.610> unit<00:05:49.030> the

00:05:49.710 --> 00:05:49.720 
though all use the same motor unit the

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:54.120 
though all use the same motor unit the
only<00:05:50.050> difference<00:05:50.500> is<00:05:50.710> the<00:05:51.430> impeller<00:05:51.850> so<00:05:52.840> I<00:05:53.230> had

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:54.130 
only difference is the impeller so I had

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:57.330 
only difference is the impeller so I had
an<00:05:54.400> aqua<00:05:54.790> clear<00:05:54.970> 20<00:05:55.870> then<00:05:56.620> I<00:05:56.650> took<00:05:56.860> the<00:05:57.160> motor

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:57.340 
an aqua clear 20 then I took the motor

00:05:57.340 --> 00:06:00.300 
an aqua clear 20 then I took the motor
out<00:05:57.430> of<00:05:57.690> I'm<00:05:58.690> going<00:05:58.900> to<00:05:59.020> take<00:05:59.260> away<00:05:59.410> this

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:00.310 
out of I'm going to take away this

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:01.950 
out of I'm going to take away this
impeller<00:06:00.730> which<00:06:01.030> you<00:06:01.150> can<00:06:01.270> see<00:06:01.420> has<00:06:01.570> four

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:01.960 
impeller which you can see has four

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:06.480 
impeller which you can see has four
little<00:06:02.200> fins<00:06:03.120> the<00:06:04.120> aqua<00:06:04.420> clear<00:06:04.570> 70<00:06:05.170> has<00:06:05.980> six

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:06.490 
little fins the aqua clear 70 has six

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:09.200 
little fins the aqua clear 70 has six
fins<00:06:06.850> and<00:06:07.150> they<00:06:07.330> are<00:06:07.570> slightly<00:06:07.960> larger<00:06:08.560> than

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:09.210 
fins and they are slightly larger than

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:13.440 
fins and they are slightly larger than
the<00:06:10.210> fins<00:06:10.450> on<00:06:10.660> the<00:06:10.690> 20<00:06:11.140> ok<00:06:11.970> I'm<00:06:12.970> just<00:06:13.120> going<00:06:13.360> to

00:06:13.440 --> 00:06:13.450 
the fins on the 20 ok I'm just going to

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:16.620 
the fins on the 20 ok I'm just going to
slide<00:06:13.690> the<00:06:14.170> my<00:06:14.980> new<00:06:15.160> aqua<00:06:15.520> color<00:06:15.730> 70<00:06:16.180> impeller

00:06:16.620 --> 00:06:16.630 
slide the my new aqua color 70 impeller

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:22.640 
slide the my new aqua color 70 impeller
into<00:06:17.140> the<00:06:17.290> aqua<00:06:18.010> clear<00:06:18.100> 20<00:06:18.580> motor<00:06:19.000> and<00:06:20.130> then

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:22.650 
into the aqua clear 20 motor and then

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:27.000 
into the aqua clear 20 motor and then
reattach<00:06:23.650> it<00:06:23.860> to<00:06:24.040> the<00:06:24.960> filter<00:06:25.960> see<00:06:26.380> it's<00:06:26.710> just

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:27.010 
reattach it to the filter see it's just

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:29.100 
reattach it to the filter see it's just
fine<00:06:27.280> it's<00:06:27.580> rated<00:06:28.270> the<00:06:28.360> same<00:06:28.540> you<00:06:28.750> can<00:06:28.810> go<00:06:29.050> to

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:29.110 
fine it's rated the same you can go to

00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:31.890 
fine it's rated the same you can go to
aqua<00:06:29.650> Claire's<00:06:29.890> website<00:06:30.310> the<00:06:30.850> parts<00:06:31.300> I<00:06:31.510> have

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:31.900 
aqua Claire's website the parts I have

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:35.040 
aqua Claire's website the parts I have
the<00:06:31.990> same<00:06:32.200> number<00:06:32.410> all<00:06:32.740> the<00:06:33.010> motors<00:06:33.310> so<00:06:34.000> it's<00:06:34.960> a

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:35.050 
the same number all the motors so it's a
