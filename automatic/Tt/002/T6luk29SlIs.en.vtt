00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:34.820
 opinion there in the comments or 

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:36.890
 like this light 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.360
 So let's start working. 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.610
 first of all I wanted to warn you that a 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:43.400
 trip solo then guys is a chore 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:45.530
 very good of you to do for example if 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:48.019
 Do you want to make a tower I do not know? 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.519
 stomp die you can go down and do 

00:00:48.019 --> 00:00:52.610
 Your replica is very good and fast. 

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:54.619
 quickly you gun her then in mine 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:56.059
 opinion is a very good flu only that she 

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:57.170
 it took a while to make a 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:59.059
 little time 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:02.330
 first guys will be as follows 

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:05.030
 It's only you down I think I do not know until 

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:07.100
 the layer 50 may be up to the tank if 

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:10.280
 I want the father, I think it's a great 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.180
 place will not beauty will start again 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.830
 let's go here 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.770
 for example the guys here are going to be there 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:17.870
 up will be like so we are 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.970
 here on top of block 70 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:23.360
 then we 'll make a hole here and 

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:26.000
 will dig up the block 40 beauty is 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.680
 country here not to confuse ready 

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.390
 so here you can start to 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.460
 build up because it will be as follows 

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.170
 'you will close up here to 

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.060
 No one wants to get in the way. 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:37.400
 have to close a little more like this 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.560
 and leaves three time blocks your 

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.540
 height and one more block up then 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.190
 you break those three more breaks 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.960
 these three will look this way 

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:47.570
 ready now that you've done this part 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:50.000
 It's just the next thing is to make that hole 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.890
 here you go and get a little 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.200
 Stair way this way I 'm going to break 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:57.320
 these three blocks and just one block here 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.850
 so you're going to go down three more blocks 

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.409
 It's going to look exactly like this here. 

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:02.870
 guys while you're coming down 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:04.460
 you 'll probably find it 's charcoal 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:05.240
 so make a torch to stay longer 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.370
 clear 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.379
 So people, now you're going to do the 

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:10.039
 next will break these three blocks and 

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:13.099
 it will break 

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:15.440
 here it will come out digging down until da 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:17.870
 more or less 20 blocks of descent 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.870
 so much that a person dies inherent in the 

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:20.670
 it was the iron 

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:23.069
 We are here to stay more 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.500
 Our little trepp is cute and it continues 

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:27.930
 descending the pac has another cave 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:30.989
 Shit ready I think even the block 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:34.440
 10 will be you know that you came so much 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:37.980

 earth is not very important 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.840
 I forgot to mention it here in case 

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:47.909
 When you finish doing this here. 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.959

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:02.400

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.739
 I quickly know you're already up here. 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.079
 It's already down there, beauty, you go. 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:09.989

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:17.730
 detail is what will be the next you 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:21.209
 will put a block here and ready already 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:23.430
 totally made to trek to vote the minimum 

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:26.370
 from scratch to show you how she 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:29.069
 It works beauty, you'll put it here. 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:30.690
 will pull your enemy in that case will 

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:31.950
 be in the bottom block is that you want the 

00:03:30.690 --> 00:03:38.040
 bald stone 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:39.870
 here is the beauty so you will put 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.970
 here and you will pull the guy and it will fall into this 

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:44.250
 Direction, then you're going to crash. 

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:47.430
 back and will already close here more 

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:49.019
 I came running and just breaking with attacks. 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:52.019
 then guys also with a troupe well 

00:03:49.019 --> 00:03:53.849
 simple type is not that simple but 

00:03:52.019 --> 00:03:55.829
 You can understand that she really is well. 

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:58.260
 easy to do yourself, and also that your 

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:59.669
 enemy will become very bewildered is 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.079
 that at the time it was pulled 

00:03:59.669 --> 00:04:02.940
 even more so if you put an area that 

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:04.109
 sells around here and will think that she 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:05.849
 intend to understand 

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:07.859
 effigy then he will be wanting 

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:09.930
 break here and tals meanwhile you 

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:11.819
 Just give a little back and close here. 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:14.489
 while I was knocking at last 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:16.769

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:19.019
