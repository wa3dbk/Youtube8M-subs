00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
signal drops just a little bit but it

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:18.160 
signal drops just a little bit but it
has<00:03:15.820> has<00:03:16.820> a<00:03:16.850> little<00:03:17.060> bit<00:03:17.120> more<00:03:17.180> point<00:03:17.570> number

again there's gonna be a single drop and
you<00:03:43.370> can<00:03:43.580> EQ<00:03:43.910> to<00:03:44.000> taste<00:03:56.110> and<00:03:57.110> then<00:03:57.800> number<00:03:57.950> five

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:58.280 
you can EQ to taste and then number five

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:00.400 
you can EQ to taste and then number five
is<00:03:58.640> going<00:03:58.850> to<00:03:58.940> be<00:03:59.030> the<00:03:59.570> bridge<00:03:59.750> pickups<00:04:00.200> in

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:00.410 
is going to be the bridge pickups in

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:03.130 
is going to be the bridge pickups in
series<00:04:01.160> and<00:04:02.150> that's<00:04:02.540> got<00:04:02.780> a<00:04:02.810> nice<00:04:02.990> little

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:03.140 
series and that's got a nice little

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:13.870 
series and that's got a nice little
modern<00:04:03.530> bite<00:04:03.709> to<00:04:03.890> it<00:04:12.280> so<00:04:13.280> you<00:04:13.370> may<00:04:13.489> be<00:04:13.550> asking

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:13.880 
modern bite to it so you may be asking

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:16.960 
modern bite to it so you may be asking
yourself<00:04:14.180> why<00:04:14.360> why<00:04:14.690> did<00:04:14.930> Elektra<00:04:15.430> bother<00:04:16.430> to

00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:16.970 
yourself why why did Elektra bother to

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:18.820 
yourself why why did Elektra bother to
to<00:04:17.570> do<00:04:17.690> this<00:04:17.840> with<00:04:18.019> the<00:04:18.109> rotary<00:04:18.380> switch<00:04:18.410> and

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:18.830 
to do this with the rotary switch and

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:21.039 
to do this with the rotary switch and
the<00:04:19.010> answer<00:04:19.280> is<00:04:19.400> they<00:04:20.269> were<00:04:20.630> trying<00:04:20.840> to<00:04:20.870> figure

00:04:21.039 --> 00:04:21.049 
the answer is they were trying to figure

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:22.480 
the answer is they were trying to figure
out<00:04:21.140> a<00:04:21.229> way<00:04:21.380> for<00:04:21.410> you<00:04:21.680> not<00:04:21.769> to<00:04:22.100> have<00:04:22.130> to<00:04:22.250> carry

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:22.490 
out a way for you not to have to carry

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:24.790 
out a way for you not to have to carry
ten<00:04:22.820> instruments<00:04:23.330> to<00:04:23.450> a<00:04:23.479> gig<00:04:23.720> or<00:04:23.990> at<00:04:24.620> least

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:24.800 
ten instruments to a gig or at least

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.490 
ten instruments to a gig or at least
five<00:04:25.010> in<00:04:25.220> this<00:04:25.310> case<00:04:25.370> so<00:04:26.120> they<00:04:26.270> have<00:04:26.510> a<00:04:26.810> 5<00:04:27.290> way

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:27.500 
five in this case so they have a 5 way

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:29.590 
five in this case so they have a 5 way
switch<00:04:27.530> which<00:04:28.010> gives<00:04:28.250> you<00:04:28.400> P<00:04:28.669> bass<00:04:28.850> tones<00:04:29.150> some

00:04:29.590 --> 00:04:29.600 
switch which gives you P bass tones some

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:32.140 
switch which gives you P bass tones some
music<00:04:30.169> man<00:04:30.260> tones<00:04:30.530> and<00:04:30.860> then<00:04:31.460> everything<00:04:31.910> sort

00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:32.150 
music man tones and then everything sort

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:34.690 
music man tones and then everything sort
of<00:04:32.210> in<00:04:32.360> between<00:04:32.450> and<00:04:32.960> that<00:04:33.919> saves<00:04:34.160> our<00:04:34.310> back<00:04:34.490> it

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:34.700 
of in between and that saves our back it

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:36.190 
of in between and that saves our back it
saves<00:04:34.910> you<00:04:34.970> money<00:04:35.120> it<00:04:35.360> saves<00:04:35.510> you<00:04:35.660> time<00:04:35.690> saves

playing something let's say nice sort of
P<00:04:45.680> based<00:04:45.890> thing<00:04:46.160> then<00:04:46.970> you<00:04:47.419> want<00:04:47.600> to<00:04:47.660> flip<00:04:48.169> to

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:48.650 
P based thing then you want to flip to

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:51.280 
P based thing then you want to flip to
the<00:04:49.210> extreme<00:04:50.210> which<00:04:50.510> is<00:04:50.540> jumping<00:04:51.050> to<00:04:51.080> the

the extreme which is jumping to the

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:57.120 
the extreme which is jumping to the
bridge<00:04:51.470> pickup

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:57.130

base setting and I like the fact that uh

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:15.000 
base setting and I like the fact that uh
flat<00:05:09.100> it<00:05:10.090> sounds<00:05:13.110> very<00:05:14.110> base<00:05:14.380> leg<00:05:14.620> but<00:05:14.860> then

flat it sounds very base leg but then
you<00:05:15.100> roll<00:05:15.310> up<00:05:15.340> a<00:05:15.550> little<00:05:15.760> bit<00:05:15.940> of<00:05:16.030> low<00:05:16.300> end<00:05:16.540> and

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:21.930 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:25.260 

make<00:05:22.930> some<00:05:23.110> more<00:05:23.290> round<00:05:23.740> here<00:05:24.130> I<00:05:24.160> say<00:05:24.520> and<00:05:24.760> then

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:25.270 
make some more round here I say and then

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:33.379 
make some more round here I say and then
we<00:05:25.420> have<00:05:25.630> Yan<00:05:26.290> Fletcher

00:05:33.379 --> 00:05:33.389 

00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:37.640 

and<00:05:34.259> then<00:05:34.469> another<00:05:35.129> one<00:05:35.430> is<00:05:36.259> right<00:05:37.259> in<00:05:37.469> the

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:37.650 
and then another one is right in the

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:39.649 
and then another one is right in the
middle<00:05:37.860> with<00:05:38.219> the<00:05:38.400> whole<00:05:38.580> thing<00:05:38.819> firing<00:05:39.599> on

00:05:39.649 --> 00:05:39.659 
middle with the whole thing firing on

00:05:39.659 --> 00:05:46.040 
middle with the whole thing firing on
all<00:05:39.689> cylinders<00:05:43.909> just<00:05:44.909> sort<00:05:45.120> of<00:05:45.210> moves<00:05:45.389> the<00:05:45.599> the

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:46.050 
all cylinders just sort of moves the the

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:51.080 
all cylinders just sort of moves the the
EQ<00:05:46.439> just<00:05:46.650> a<00:05:46.740> hair<00:05:46.949> and<00:05:49.490> where<00:05:50.490> that<00:05:50.639> bass<00:05:50.909> is

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:51.090 
EQ just a hair and where that bass is

00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:52.939 
EQ just a hair and where that bass is
placed<00:05:51.360> in<00:05:51.509> the<00:05:51.569> mix<00:05:51.840> and<00:05:52.080> so<00:05:52.500> it<00:05:52.650> has<00:05:52.770> a<00:05:52.800> little

00:05:52.939 --> 00:05:52.949 
placed in the mix and so it has a little

00:05:52.949 --> 00:05:54.920 
placed in the mix and so it has a little
bit<00:05:53.009> more<00:05:53.069> point<00:05:53.400> on<00:05:53.520> this<00:05:53.610> one<00:05:53.669> so<00:05:54.000> again<00:05:54.840> the

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:54.930 
bit more point on this one so again the

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:56.629 
bit more point on this one so again the
number<00:05:55.020> one<00:05:55.289> number<00:05:55.469> three<00:05:55.770> settings<00:05:56.129> are
