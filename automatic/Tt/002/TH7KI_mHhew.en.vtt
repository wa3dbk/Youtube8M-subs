00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
the ghost class burst with the law is my

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:04.969 
the ghost class burst with the law is my
secondary<00:02:03.390> just<00:02:04.259> so<00:02:04.350> that<00:02:04.530> i<00:02:04.560> can<00:02:04.649> get<00:02:04.860> those

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
secondary just so that i can get those

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.069 
secondary just so that i can get those
extra<00:02:05.189> points<00:02:05.820> or<00:02:06.149> shooting<00:02:06.600> down<00:02:06.750> the<00:02:06.869> spy

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
extra points or shooting down the spy

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:10.460 
extra points or shooting down the spy
planes<00:02:07.439> and<00:02:07.789> because<00:02:08.789> the<00:02:09.660> killstreaks<00:02:10.349> are

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
planes and because the killstreaks are

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:11.550 
planes and because the killstreaks are
set<00:02:10.739> you<00:02:11.009> always

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:11.560 
set you always

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:12.809 
set you always
know<00:02:11.620> that<00:02:11.830> people<00:02:12.099> are<00:02:12.250> going<00:02:12.430> to<00:02:12.520> be<00:02:12.610> running

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:12.819 
know that people are going to be running

00:02:12.819 --> 00:02:15.600 
know that people are going to be running
spy<00:02:13.150> plane<00:02:13.480> so<00:02:13.959> it<00:02:13.989> makes<00:02:14.260> it<00:02:14.410> really<00:02:14.800> easy<00:02:14.950> to

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
spy plane so it makes it really easy to

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:17.790 
spy plane so it makes it really easy to
get<00:02:16.030> those<00:02:16.209> kills<00:02:16.569> or<00:02:16.840> those<00:02:17.170> shots<00:02:17.470> towards

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
get those kills or those shots towards

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.690 
get those kills or those shots towards
ghost<00:02:18.370> pro<00:02:18.730> and<00:02:19.290> actually<00:02:20.290> you<00:02:20.500> can<00:02:20.680> get<00:02:21.430> dosed

I had a contract set for seven spy
planes<00:02:44.140> which<00:02:45.100> I<00:02:45.310> don't<00:02:46.060> even<00:02:46.180> I<00:02:46.450> think<00:02:46.540> I'd

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:46.810 
planes which I don't even I think I'd

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.750 
planes which I don't even I think I'd
only<00:02:46.900> get<00:02:47.080> like<00:02:47.230> three<00:02:47.530> in<00:02:47.620> this<00:02:47.739> game<00:02:48.010> but<00:02:48.280> I

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760 
only get like three in this game but I

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.360 
only get like three in this game but I
only<00:02:49.510> died<00:02:49.720> a<00:02:49.750> couple<00:02:49.959> of<00:02:50.140> times<00:02:50.350> too<00:02:50.680> so

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.370 
only died a couple of times too so

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:54.240 
only died a couple of times too so
typically<00:02:52.360> when<00:02:52.660> I<00:02:52.720> go<00:02:52.930> into<00:02:53.080> classic<00:02:53.830> TDM

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
typically when I go into classic TDM

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.300 
typically when I go into classic TDM
I'll<00:02:54.760> run<00:02:55.060> with<00:02:55.090> one<00:02:55.569> maybe<00:02:56.140> two<00:02:56.319> friends<00:02:57.160> that

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
I'll run with one maybe two friends that

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.820 
I'll run with one maybe two friends that
I<00:02:57.819> can<00:02:58.120> count<00:02:58.299> on<00:02:58.480> that<00:02:58.540> are<00:02:58.840> going<00:02:59.200> to<00:02:59.319> do

00:02:59.820 --> 00:02:59.830 
I can count on that are going to do

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:01.860 
I can count on that are going to do
badly<00:03:00.130> and<00:03:00.489> they're<00:03:00.849> going<00:03:00.970> to<00:03:01.030> end<00:03:01.360> up<00:03:01.599> pretty

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
badly and they're going to end up pretty

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:03.839 
badly and they're going to end up pretty
positive<00:03:02.110> just<00:03:02.799> so<00:03:02.920> that<00:03:02.950> I<00:03:03.160> can<00:03:03.250> ensure<00:03:03.670> the

00:03:03.839 --> 00:03:03.849 
positive just so that I can ensure the

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:06.059 
positive just so that I can ensure the
win<00:03:04.030> if<00:03:04.959> you<00:03:05.140> run<00:03:05.349> with<00:03:05.500> any<00:03:05.620> more<00:03:05.920> than<00:03:06.040> that

00:03:06.059 --> 00:03:06.069 
win if you run with any more than that

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:09.000 
win if you run with any more than that
there's<00:03:07.030> a<00:03:07.150> chance<00:03:07.450> that<00:03:07.569> you<00:03:08.319> won't<00:03:08.530> get<00:03:08.799> a

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
there's a chance that you won't get a

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.430 
there's a chance that you won't get a
very<00:03:09.430> great<00:03:09.700> score<00:03:10.090> and<00:03:10.269> if<00:03:10.870> you<00:03:11.019> run<00:03:11.230> with

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:11.440 
very great score and if you run with

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.890 
very great score and if you run with
less<00:03:12.010> than<00:03:12.040> that<00:03:12.430> then<00:03:12.730> there's<00:03:13.540> a<00:03:13.599> chance

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:13.900 
less than that then there's a chance

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.949 
less than that then there's a chance
that<00:03:13.989> you're<00:03:14.200> going<00:03:14.319> to<00:03:14.410> lose<00:03:15.540> but<00:03:16.540> overall

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 
that you're going to lose but overall

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:20.759 
that you're going to lose but overall
this<00:03:17.920> is<00:03:17.980> a<00:03:18.160> great<00:03:18.700> way<00:03:18.940> to<00:03:19.000> keep<00:03:19.870> your<00:03:20.079> KD<00:03:20.440> up

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:20.769 
this is a great way to keep your KD up

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:22.860 
this is a great way to keep your KD up
while<00:03:21.760> you're<00:03:21.940> going<00:03:22.209> to<00:03:22.359> those<00:03:22.510> beginner

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
disadvantage the people in classic TDM

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:32.759 
disadvantage the people in classic TDM
aren't<00:03:30.370> very<00:03:30.549> good<00:03:30.700> I<00:03:31.090> have<00:03:32.079> to<00:03:32.200> say<00:03:32.350> that<00:03:32.560> it's

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:32.769 
aren't very good I have to say that it's

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:34.710 
aren't very good I have to say that it's
been<00:03:33.010> like<00:03:33.160> that<00:03:33.310> since<00:03:33.370> the<00:03:33.850> game<00:03:34.329> came<00:03:34.600> out

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
been like that since the game came out

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:38.150 
been like that since the game came out
this<00:03:35.410> is<00:03:35.680> a<00:03:35.790> little<00:03:36.790> while<00:03:36.940> into<00:03:37.269> the

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
this is a little while into the

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.750 
this is a little while into the
christmas/new<00:03:39.160> Barrow<00:03:39.519> but<00:03:40.590> still<00:03:41.590> it's<00:03:41.920> not

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:42.760 
christmas/new Barrow but still it's not

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.080 
christmas/new Barrow but still it's not
much<00:03:43.030> better<00:03:43.299> typically<00:03:44.310> so<00:03:45.310> yeah<00:03:45.609> this<00:03:45.880> is

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:46.090 
much better typically so yeah this is

00:03:46.090 --> 00:03:49.770 
much better typically so yeah this is
just<00:03:46.329> a<00:03:46.950> great<00:03:47.950> way<00:03:48.160> for<00:03:48.220> you<00:03:48.639> to<00:03:48.670> be<00:03:49.569> able<00:03:49.600> to
