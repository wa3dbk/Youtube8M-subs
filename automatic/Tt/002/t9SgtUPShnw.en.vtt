00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
one transition speed and stuff and you

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:35.090 
one transition speed and stuff and you

choose which camera to use and the

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.970 
choose which camera to use and the
shortcuts<00:03:35.760> this<00:03:36.480> is<00:03:36.630> a<00:03:36.660> real<00:03:36.930> like<00:03:37.170> real<00:03:37.740> time

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
shortcuts this is a real like real time

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.310 
shortcuts this is a real like real time
thing<00:03:38.220> and<00:03:38.400> it's<00:03:38.520> a<00:03:38.700> kind<00:03:39.209> of<00:03:39.270> high<00:03:39.420> end<00:03:39.600> but

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:40.320 
thing and it's a kind of high end but

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.290 
thing and it's a kind of high end but
still<00:03:40.890> much<00:03:41.070> cheaper<00:03:41.100> than<00:03:41.610> other<00:03:41.760> solutions

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:42.300 
still much cheaper than other solutions

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:44.360 
still much cheaper than other solutions
i<00:03:42.390> guess<00:03:42.570> but<00:03:43.050> its<00:03:43.200> twenty<00:03:43.320> six<00:03:43.860> thousand

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:44.370 
i guess but its twenty six thousand

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.250 
i guess but its twenty six thousand
that's<00:03:44.640> what<00:03:44.760> i<00:03:44.820> heard<00:03:44.850> we<00:03:45.239> were<00:03:45.360> in<00:03:45.510> part<00:03:45.720> 25

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:46.260 
that's what i heard we were in part 25

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:49.760 
that's what i heard we were in part 25

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:57.380 
Europe 25,000 and there's also a version

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:01.760 
Europe 25,000 and there's also a version
the<00:03:58.380> smaller<00:03:58.620> one<00:03:58.800> which<00:03:59.130> is<00:03:59.190> also<00:03:59.700> a<00:03:59.850> price<00:04:00.770> 50

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:01.770 
the smaller one which is also a price 50

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:04.100 
the smaller one which is also a price 50
or<00:04:02.070> 60<00:04:02.430> fifteen<00:04:03.180> to<00:04:03.330> sixteen<00:04:03.480> thousand<00:04:03.959> euro

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.110 
or 60 fifteen to sixteen thousand euro

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:06.170 
or 60 fifteen to sixteen thousand euro
and<00:04:04.320> there<00:04:04.830> are<00:04:04.890> different<00:04:05.160> prices<00:04:05.250> in<00:04:05.790> the<00:04:06.060> US

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
and there are different prices in the US

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.479 
and there are different prices in the US
I<00:04:06.630> guess<00:04:06.870> because<00:04:07.560> the<00:04:07.739> different<00:04:08.040> access<00:04:08.370> to

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:08.489 
I guess because the different access to

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:11.470 
I guess because the different access to
everything<00:04:08.790> you<00:04:09.360> just<00:04:09.600> go<00:04:09.780> a<00:04:09.810> new<00:04:10.530> tech<00:04:10.799> Europe

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:11.480 
everything you just go a new tech Europe

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:14.330 
everything you just go a new tech Europe
the<00:04:12.480> come<00:04:12.900> for<00:04:13.230> the<00:04:13.320> European<00:04:13.769> side<00:04:13.920> a<00:04:13.980> new
