one<00:00:58.620> of<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:58.800> things<00:00:59.010> that<00:00:59.190> we're<00:00:59.309> doing

00:01:00.799 --> 00:01:00.809 
one of the things that we're doing

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:06.200 
one of the things that we're doing
as<00:01:01.809> we're<00:01:02.109> taking<00:01:03.330> the<00:01:04.330> 16<00:01:04.720> foot<00:01:04.750> set<00:01:05.199> of<00:01:05.320> hulls

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
as we're taking the 16 foot set of hulls

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:08.460 
as we're taking the 16 foot set of hulls
spreading<00:01:07.210> them<00:01:07.299> far<00:01:07.720> enough<00:01:07.840> apart<00:01:08.080> so<00:01:08.320> that

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:08.470 
spreading them far enough apart so that

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:09.810 
spreading them far enough apart so that
you<00:01:08.680> can<00:01:08.799> have<00:01:08.890> a<00:01:08.920> seat<00:01:09.189> that<00:01:09.369> you<00:01:09.460> can<00:01:09.610> really

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:09.820 
you can have a seat that you can really

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.480 
you can have a seat that you can really
sit<00:01:10.030> up<00:01:10.149> high<00:01:10.409> it's<00:01:11.409> effortless<00:01:11.590> to<00:01:11.950> stand<00:01:12.280> up

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:12.490 
sit up high it's effortless to stand up

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:13.880 
sit up high it's effortless to stand up
and<00:01:12.640> sit<00:01:12.850> down

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
and sit down

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:17.370 
and sit down
this<00:01:14.890> entire<00:01:15.280> boat<00:01:15.640> breaks<00:01:16.060> down<00:01:16.380> including

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:17.380 
this entire boat breaks down including

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:19.050 
this entire boat breaks down including
the<00:01:18.009> framework<00:01:18.490> and<00:01:18.670> I'm<00:01:18.729> going<00:01:18.850> to<00:01:18.909> break

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.060 
the framework and I'm going to break

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:20.490 
the framework and I'm going to break
down<00:01:19.090> the<00:01:19.270> framework<00:01:19.810> here<00:01:20.020> and<00:01:20.110> leave<00:01:20.229> it<00:01:20.380> and

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:20.500 
down the framework here and leave it and

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.370 
down the framework here and leave it and
show<00:01:20.649> you<00:01:20.680> how<00:01:20.770> that<00:01:20.890> works<00:01:21.899> but<00:01:22.899> the<00:01:23.110> whole

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:23.380 
show you how that works but the whole

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.779 
show you how that works but the whole
boat<00:01:23.770> can<00:01:24.520> fit<00:01:24.820> inside<00:01:25.090> a<00:01:25.299> small<00:01:25.869> hatchback

boat can fit inside a small hatchback
vehicle<00:01:27.789> it<00:01:27.909> doesn't<00:01:28.210> take<00:01:28.330> a<00:01:28.360> large<00:01:28.630> SUV

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.100 
vehicle it doesn't take a large SUV

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.120 
vehicle it doesn't take a large SUV
this<00:01:30.610> of<00:01:30.789> course<00:01:30.820> folds<00:01:31.479> in<00:01:31.689> the<00:01:32.130> framework

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130 
this of course folds in the framework

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:38.779 
this of course folds in the framework
folds<00:01:33.819> in<00:01:33.970> half<00:01:34.679> and<00:01:36.060> the<00:01:37.060> whole<00:01:37.270> boat<00:01:37.569> is

00:01:38.779 --> 00:01:38.789 
folds in half and the whole boat is

00:01:38.789 --> 00:01:43.699 
folds in half and the whole boat is
$1,800<00:01:40.799> $1,800<00:01:41.799> for<00:01:42.039> the<00:01:42.190> fully<00:01:42.850> working<00:01:43.179> boat

00:01:43.699 --> 00:01:43.709 
$1,800 $1,800 for the fully working boat

00:01:43.709 --> 00:01:47.279 
$1,800 $1,800 for the fully working boat
compared<00:01:44.709> to<00:01:44.799> say<00:01:44.950> the<00:01:45.100> Hobie<00:01:46.049> angler<00:01:47.049> which

00:01:47.279 --> 00:01:47.289 
compared to say the Hobie angler which

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:50.520 
compared to say the Hobie angler which
starts<00:01:47.679> at<00:01:48.420> $2,800<00:01:49.420> without<00:01:49.929> an<00:01:50.110> electric

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:50.530 
starts at $2,800 without an electric

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:54.260 
starts at $2,800 without an electric
motor<00:01:50.770> that<00:01:52.170> their<00:01:53.170> electric<00:01:53.560> motor<00:01:53.770> is<00:01:53.979> a

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
motor that their electric motor is a

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.690 
motor that their electric motor is a
somewhere<00:01:55.270> around<00:01:55.470> $700<00:01:56.470> unless<00:01:57.429> you<00:01:57.580> go<00:01:57.670> with

00:01:57.690 --> 00:01:57.700 
somewhere around $700 unless you go with

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.490 
somewhere around $700 unless you go with
the<00:01:57.880> lithium-ion<00:01:58.330> batteries<00:01:59.020> and<00:01:59.259> then<00:01:59.350> it's

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500 
the lithium-ion batteries and then it's

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.419 
the lithium-ion batteries and then it's
2,000<00:02:00.220> some<00:02:00.429> dollars<00:02:00.789> with<00:02:01.780> this<00:02:01.990> one<00:02:02.429> it

00:02:03.419 --> 00:02:03.429 
2,000 some dollars with this one it

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:05.249 
2,000 some dollars with this one it
pretty<00:02:03.729> much<00:02:03.850> does<00:02:04.119> the<00:02:04.299> trick<00:02:04.569> of<00:02:04.840> course

00:02:05.249 --> 00:02:05.259 
pretty much does the trick of course

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:11.160 
pretty much does the trick of course
explain<00:02:05.679> is<00:02:05.800> stable<00:02:06.160> you<00:02:07.769> can<00:02:08.769> stand<00:02:09.009> up<00:02:10.170> the

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:11.170 
explain is stable you can stand up the

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.770 
explain is stable you can stand up the
battery<00:02:11.530> is<00:02:11.680> way<00:02:11.890> down<00:02:12.069> low<00:02:12.370> you<00:02:12.670> can<00:02:13.180> also<00:02:13.420> get

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:13.780 
battery is way down low you can also get

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:15.750 
battery is way down low you can also get
the<00:02:13.959> lithium-ion<00:02:14.530> batteries<00:02:15.220> for<00:02:15.459> this<00:02:15.550> one

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
the lithium-ion batteries for this one

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.800 
the lithium-ion batteries for this one
as<00:02:15.879> well<00:02:16.060> you<00:02:16.470> can<00:02:17.470> use<00:02:17.650> a<00:02:17.680> stand<00:02:18.040> up<00:02:18.220> paddle

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
as well you can use a stand up paddle

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.630 
as well you can use a stand up paddle
it's<00:02:19.810> not<00:02:20.110> like<00:02:20.319> standing<00:02:20.800> on<00:02:20.890> a<00:02:20.950> kayak<00:02:21.430> this

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:21.640 
it's not like standing on a kayak this

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:23.509 
it's not like standing on a kayak this
is<00:02:21.760> more<00:02:21.910> like<00:02:22.090> standing<00:02:22.450> on<00:02:22.540> a<00:02:22.599> floating<00:02:22.959> dock

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:23.519 
is more like standing on a floating dock

00:02:23.519 --> 00:02:27.540 
is more like standing on a floating dock
there's<00:02:24.519> just<00:02:24.760> so<00:02:25.000> much<00:02:25.300> stability<00:02:26.140> and<00:02:27.069> of

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:27.550 
there's just so much stability and of

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.759 
there's just so much stability and of
course<00:02:27.730> I'm<00:02:27.879> facing<00:02:28.300> backwards<00:02:28.750> the<00:02:29.500> motors

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:29.769 
course I'm facing backwards the motors

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:32.130 
course I'm facing backwards the motors
in<00:02:29.800> the<00:02:29.980> rear<00:02:30.190> here<00:02:30.550> what<00:02:31.330> I'm<00:02:31.450> not<00:02:31.720> showing

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:32.140 
in the rear here what I'm not showing

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.220 
in the rear here what I'm not showing
today<00:02:32.470> is<00:02:32.890> there<00:02:33.400> will<00:02:33.610> be<00:02:33.790> right<00:02:34.390> here<00:02:34.420> will

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:35.230 
today is there will be right here will

much less drastic than the Hobie the
Hobie<00:03:44.310> is<00:03:44.400> the<00:03:44.519> one<00:03:44.640> where<00:03:44.790> you<00:03:44.849> put<00:03:45.090> the<00:03:45.269> the

it's quite deep this one's going to be
much<00:03:51.030> much<00:03:51.269> shallower<00:03:51.690> than<00:03:52.470> the<00:03:52.680> Hobie<00:03:53.010> and
