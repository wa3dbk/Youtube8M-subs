00:06:11.339 --> 00:06:11.349 
lot of anything except for just kind of

00:06:11.349 --> 00:06:13.450 
lot of anything except for just kind of
sticks<00:06:12.349> to<00:06:12.590> the<00:06:12.740> aspirin<00:06:13.159> which<00:06:13.310> is

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:13.460 
sticks to the aspirin which is

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:16.119 
sticks to the aspirin which is
absolutely<00:06:14.030> fine<00:06:14.500> so<00:06:15.500> then<00:06:15.620> I<00:06:15.650> just<00:06:15.710> take<00:06:15.979> my

00:06:16.119 --> 00:06:16.129 
absolutely fine so then I just take my

00:06:16.129 --> 00:06:18.010 
absolutely fine so then I just take my
finger<00:06:16.490> and<00:06:16.729> I<00:06:16.849> rub<00:06:17.060> it<00:06:17.180> around<00:06:17.270> until<00:06:17.750> it

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:18.020 
finger and I rub it around until it

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:20.850 
finger and I rub it around until it
melts<00:06:18.979> because<00:06:19.069> the<00:06:19.699> warmth<00:06:20.030> of<00:06:20.120> our<00:06:20.300> body

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:20.860 
melts because the warmth of our body

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:25.930 
melts because the warmth of our body
will<00:06:21.860> help<00:06:22.460> to<00:06:22.909> melt<00:06:23.690> it<00:06:23.930> that<00:06:24.110> honey<00:06:24.409> and<00:06:24.940> this

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:25.940 
will help to melt it that honey and this

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:28.300 
will help to melt it that honey and this
feels<00:06:26.210> really<00:06:26.750> really<00:06:26.930> nice<00:06:27.229> on<00:06:27.530> the<00:06:27.800> face<00:06:28.009> if

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:28.310 
feels really really nice on the face if

00:06:28.310 --> 00:06:31.890 
feels really really nice on the face if
you<00:06:28.669> just<00:06:29.000> use<00:06:29.360> the<00:06:29.930> aspirin<00:06:30.530> it<00:06:30.740> is<00:06:31.039> very

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:31.900 
you just use the aspirin it is very

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:34.749 
you just use the aspirin it is very
exfoliating<00:06:33.069> whereas<00:06:34.069> when<00:06:34.280> you<00:06:34.370> use<00:06:34.580> it<00:06:34.729> with

00:06:34.749 --> 00:06:34.759 
exfoliating whereas when you use it with

00:06:34.759 --> 00:06:37.649 
exfoliating whereas when you use it with
the<00:06:35.030> honey<00:06:35.210> it's<00:06:35.599> definitely<00:06:36.349> a<00:06:36.380> bit<00:06:36.979> more

00:06:37.649 --> 00:06:37.659 
the honey it's definitely a bit more

00:06:37.659 --> 00:06:39.999 
the honey it's definitely a bit more
gentler<00:06:38.659> and<00:06:38.900> it<00:06:39.050> feels<00:06:39.259> really<00:06:39.560> really<00:06:39.650> nice

00:06:39.999 --> 00:06:40.009 
gentler and it feels really really nice

00:06:40.009 --> 00:06:42.939 
gentler and it feels really really nice
kind<00:06:40.460> of<00:06:40.580> almost<00:06:40.880> got<00:06:41.000> like<00:06:41.449> a<00:06:41.509> silky<00:06:42.169> grainy

00:06:42.939 --> 00:06:42.949 
kind of almost got like a silky grainy

00:06:42.949 --> 00:06:46.809 
kind of almost got like a silky grainy
feel<00:06:43.340> to<00:06:43.580> it<00:06:43.699> so<00:06:43.729> that<00:06:44.210> is<00:06:45.199> all<00:06:45.500> it<00:06:45.919> is<00:06:45.949> okay

00:06:46.809 --> 00:06:46.819 
feel to it so that is all it is okay

00:06:46.819 --> 00:06:48.370 
feel to it so that is all it is okay
so<00:06:46.969> I<00:06:47.000> just<00:06:47.330> mix<00:06:47.539> that<00:06:47.599> all<00:06:47.870> up<00:06:47.900> it<00:06:48.169> doesn't

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:48.380 
so I just mix that all up it doesn't

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:49.480 
so I just mix that all up it doesn't
even<00:06:48.469> look<00:06:48.650> like<00:06:48.710> there's<00:06:49.039> really<00:06:49.190> anything

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:49.490 
even look like there's really anything

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:51.129 
even look like there's really anything
in<00:06:49.729> there<00:06:49.849> but<00:06:49.880> this<00:06:50.120> is<00:06:50.180> plenty<00:06:50.569> for<00:06:50.750> your

00:06:51.129 --> 00:06:51.139 
in there but this is plenty for your

00:06:51.139 --> 00:06:54.370
