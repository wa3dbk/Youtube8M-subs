00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.599
 efe 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:14.590
 hello good kids we are here with 

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:16.270
 a new video and today I come to show the 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:17.860
 new captor who has sent me 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:19.779
 have a good average and it was already a 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:21.700
 I change the other one because mostly I 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:25.060
 I lost a lot of quality with the videos 

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:27.040
 of ps3 and nothing is the truth and like gamer 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.020
 per table is an authentic past 

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.430
 Super small and good meets all 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:34.960
 the requirements that a 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:37.329
 capturing has thus record up to 1080p 

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.129
 and well, it has a function for live 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:41.559
 of streaming what's going on with me 

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:44.050
 We'll see if I can do it because 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:45.780
 you already know that not new very stable about 

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:48.339
 all the rise that is what depends 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.170
 to do streaming and nothing I'm going to 

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:52.300
 teach another inside and that everything 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:55.059
 that it takes and I explain to you a bit with 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.980
 with another camera so you can see it better 

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:59.559
 because with this you see a little fuzzy and 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:02.590
 well I think it will be better with the other 

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:04.660
 so I 'm going to come right away 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:07.990
 good kids we are here to see if 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:09.820
 so you can see it better to see here is 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:11.830
 the capturing good as you see this is 

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:14.800
 the button used to record and to 

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:16.960
 stop when we want to stop recording and 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:19.360
 nothing has two modes which is the mode with 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.430
 computer and sd card that carries 

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:25.660
 here I do not know if it will look good because it is 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:27.850
 the sticker is now I will take it off and 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:30.340
 nothing here carries the cable that is for 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:33.580
 connect it to the computer and the cables to 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:35.710
 see if you see there what makes these good 

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:39.550
 are the two audio the hdmi input and 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:41.710
 the output and this one that is for the ps3 or 

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:44.440
 to connect the console by component 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:47.729
 if we want to carry the two cables to 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.729
 that we can choose 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.770
 which we want to see if I can 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:52.770
 remove this 

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:00.960
 good as you see leads to see 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.299
 Take my name and write the truth 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:06.210
 which is the cane because it looked like a 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:09.959
 little one to see if it looks good to put 

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:11.390
 rubinho there what does not look a little 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:14.030
 fuzzy 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:16.880
 and good as you can see is the super small 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:20.480
 mobile that is the samsung the galaxy 3 elc3 

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:22.430
 there next to you so you can see what is super 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.739
 small 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:28.189
 and good in width is a tad more but 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:31.599
 does not go much and we will not see anything 

00:02:28.189 --> 00:02:31.599
 what is inside 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:37.980
 here it takes three months of equis split that 

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:40.170
 is the program used to make the 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:43.769
 streamings and that therefore know by 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:46.440
 give away those three three free months and 

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:49.700
 nothing to see what's inside and they're 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:49.700
 the cables and all that 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:03:02.480
 to see this is the audio 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:05.800
 then we have the one that goes to the computer 

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:07.780
 which is a usb of these normals 

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.550
 and good this is the play that 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:12.370
 connects to the play and goes straight to the 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:14.830
 entrance that small that is the same 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:16.720
 input that the one that leads this is the 

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:19.480
 same but to connect the console by 

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:22.390
 components if we want and good here already 

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:24.880
 an hdmi that is like that a bit short but 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:27.070
 to connect from the console to the 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.570
 capturing as it goes pretty well just 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:32.740
 we need one that is the one that goes to the 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:35.260
 tele that we will have it in any case and 

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:37.480
 nothing wears a neoprene sleeve that is 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:40.150
 Pretty cool to put it like that 

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:41.890
 Take the captive house of a 

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:45.340
 colleague or something we put it here 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:49.120
 inside and we only need an sd card 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:51.100
 and an HDMI cable to be able to record or if 

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:54.010
 we're going on a trip or whatever, because the 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:56.170
 true that you lament in your pocket and 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:59.380
 It is super comfortable to take the chair 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:01.510
 up and down and nothing to see that's all 

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:04.810
 I'm going to show you what the 

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:07.870
 minimum requirements for the capturing 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:11.380
 see if the computer looks good 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:16.510
 would be an intel core 2 duo 2 8 gb 

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:20.080
 or an average of 64 dual-core to 3 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:24.400
 gigahertz and nothing asks for 4 gb of ram 

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:29.020
 sb 2.0 and is only compatible with the 

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:32.139
 windows 8 and 7 of 32 and 64 bits 

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:33.940
 and nothing and put what's inside that already 

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:38.620
 I said the cables that I have there 

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:41.319
 that and the specifications that is that the 

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:42.699
 hm and the component cable and nothing what 

00:04:41.319 --> 00:04:45.879
 that I have shown the cables that I have 

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:48.789
 taught and I hope that I have 

00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:50.510
 I liked and here I leave it to the 

00:04:48.789 --> 00:04:54.500
 see 

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:57.710
 well it is very small and very comfortable to 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:05:00.140
 take it up and down as I said and 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:02.380
 I hope that you liked it and even 

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:02.380
 the next
