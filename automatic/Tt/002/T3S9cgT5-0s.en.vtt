there's<00:01:32.939> a<00:01:33.000> revived<00:01:33.360> vessel<00:01:33.840> right<00:01:34.020> under

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
there's a revived vessel right under

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.280 
there's a revived vessel right under
this<00:01:34.530> area<00:01:34.770> under<00:01:35.400> the<00:01:35.490> DMM<00:01:35.939> so<00:01:36.689> we've<00:01:36.869> got<00:01:37.079> the

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
this area under the DMM so we've got the

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.950 
this area under the DMM so we've got the
upper<00:01:37.770> quad<00:01:37.979> also<00:01:38.670> pumping<00:01:39.090> now<00:01:39.780> we're

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
upper quad also pumping now we're

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.840 
upper quad also pumping now we're
pumping<00:01:40.320> from<00:01:40.710> the<00:01:40.829> foot<00:01:41.130> all<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:41.490> way<00:01:41.790> up

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:41.850 
pumping from the foot all the way up

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.499 
pumping from the foot all the way up
look<00:01:42.560> over<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.619> top<00:01:43.890> and<00:01:44.729> what<00:01:44.939> happens<00:01:45.299> is

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
look over the top and what happens is

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.350 
look over the top and what happens is
the<00:01:45.930> fluid<00:01:46.649> is<00:01:46.829> it<00:01:47.220> works<00:01:47.460> in<00:01:47.610> a<00:01:47.670> negative<00:01:48.149> four

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
the fluid is it works in a negative four

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.359 
the fluid is it works in a negative four
and<00:01:48.390> negative<00:01:48.570> pressure<00:01:49.020> so<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:50.130> body

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
and negative pressure so the body

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:52.789 
and negative pressure so the body
vessels<00:01:50.850> are<00:01:50.939> only<00:01:51.119> going<00:01:51.509> this<00:01:51.750> way<00:01:51.990> and<00:01:52.229> they

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
vessels are only going this way and they

are nearly fully dependent on
activation<00:01:55.610> balloon<00:01:56.060> fluid<00:01:56.510> okay<00:01:57.260> here's

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
activation balloon fluid okay here's

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:59.410 
activation balloon fluid okay here's
your<00:01:57.980> muscle<00:01:58.310> activation<00:01:58.790> cuz<00:01:58.880> you're<00:01:59.030> doing

00:01:59.410 --> 00:01:59.420 
your muscle activation cuz you're doing

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:00.310 
your muscle activation cuz you're doing
okay

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320 
okay

just played a college soccer game I go

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:22.270 
just played a college soccer game I go
ahead<00:02:20.450> it's<00:02:20.750> time<00:02:20.990> to<00:02:21.110> recover<00:02:21.440> your<00:02:21.620> legs<00:02:21.830> can

probably not otherwise how do I do it
this<00:02:28.910> way<00:02:29.090> for<00:02:29.150> you<00:02:29.510> yeah<00:02:29.840> but<00:02:30.020> all<00:02:30.140> you<00:02:30.260> do<00:02:30.410> is

sit there and setting can you say not

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.400 
sit there and setting can you say not
really<00:02:32.980> watching<00:02:33.980> us<00:02:34.310> that's<00:02:34.580> not<00:02:34.730> true

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:35.410 
really watching us that's not true

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:38.230 
really watching us that's not true
just<00:02:36.410> only<00:02:36.590> my<00:02:36.800> hot<00:02:36.980> tub<00:02:37.190> so<00:02:37.700> the<00:02:37.940> great<00:02:38.210> news

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:38.240 
just only my hot tub so the great news

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:41.650 
just only my hot tub so the great news
is<00:02:38.810> you<00:02:39.110> can<00:02:39.710> use<00:02:40.040> the<00:02:40.970> body's<00:02:41.450> natural

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:41.660 
is you can use the body's natural

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.980 
is you can use the body's natural
healing<00:02:41.960> process<00:02:42.790> by<00:02:43.790> simply<00:02:44.330> activating<00:02:44.900> the

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:44.990 
healing process by simply activating the

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:46.660 
healing process by simply activating the
muscles<00:02:45.380> we<00:02:45.800> were<00:02:45.920> talking<00:02:46.310> a<00:02:46.370> little<00:02:46.400> earlier

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 
muscles we were talking a little earlier

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:51.120 
muscles we were talking a little earlier
today<00:02:47.240> about<00:02:47.420> how<00:02:48.140> walking<00:02:48.890> is<00:02:49.580> very<00:02:50.330> good<00:02:50.780> at

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:51.130 
today about how walking is very good at

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:54.430 
today about how walking is very good at
D<00:02:52.130> congesting<00:02:52.760> and<00:02:52.880> area<00:02:53.180> basically<00:02:53.990> called

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
D congesting and area basically called

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.370 
D congesting and area basically called
active<00:02:54.860> recovery<00:02:55.210> so<00:02:56.210> you<00:02:56.300> can<00:02:56.540> go<00:02:56.900> for<00:02:57.110> a<00:02:57.140> walk

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:57.380 
active recovery so you can go for a walk

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:59.230 
active recovery so you can go for a walk
or<00:02:57.680> light<00:02:57.890> ride<00:02:58.100> on<00:02:58.280> a<00:02:58.370> bike<00:02:58.580> and<00:02:58.730> an<00:02:58.850> active

00:02:59.230 --> 00:02:59.240 
or light ride on a bike and an active

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:01.690 
or light ride on a bike and an active
recovery<00:02:59.540> well<00:03:00.380> one<00:03:00.950> day<00:03:01.100> I<00:03:01.130> was<00:03:01.280> thinking<00:03:01.610> a

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
recovery well one day I was thinking a

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.970 
recovery well one day I was thinking a
few<00:03:01.730> has<00:03:02.120> a<00:03:02.150> wall<00:03:02.390> it's<00:03:02.840> not<00:03:03.020> walking<00:03:03.380> because

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:03.980 
few has a wall it's not walking because

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.430 
few has a wall it's not walking because
it<00:03:04.300> because<00:03:05.300> if<00:03:05.420> you<00:03:05.540> walked<00:03:05.780> in<00:03:05.990> the<00:03:06.080> moon<00:03:06.260> it

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:06.440 
it because if you walked in the moon it

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.190 
it because if you walked in the moon it
wouldn't<00:03:06.770> work<00:03:07.270> and<00:03:08.270> that's<00:03:08.540> because<00:03:08.930> in<00:03:09.080> the

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:09.200 
wouldn't work and that's because in the

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.660 
wouldn't work and that's because in the
moon<00:03:09.350> you<00:03:09.500> wouldn't<00:03:09.770> activate<00:03:10.130> the<00:03:10.250> muscles

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
moon you wouldn't activate the muscles

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.420 
moon you wouldn't activate the muscles
so<00:03:11.360> it<00:03:11.600> isn't<00:03:12.050> the<00:03:12.230> walking<00:03:12.530> it<00:03:12.860> isn't<00:03:13.280> the

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:13.430 
so it isn't the walking it isn't the

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.290 
so it isn't the walking it isn't the
cycle<00:03:13.880> it's<00:03:14.570> the<00:03:14.720> muscle<00:03:15.050> activation<00:03:16.030> it's<00:03:17.030> so

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:17.300 
cycle it's the muscle activation it's so

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.330 
cycle it's the muscle activation it's so
simple<00:03:17.720> to<00:03:17.900> follow<00:03:18.320> as<00:03:18.620> soon<00:03:18.830> as<00:03:18.950> you<00:03:19.040> get<00:03:19.160> the

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:19.340 
simple to follow as soon as you get the

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.720 
simple to follow as soon as you get the
point

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:19.730 
point

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:22.449 
point
now<00:03:20.120> I<00:03:20.150> went<00:03:20.630> 20<00:03:21.200> years<00:03:21.530> before<00:03:21.800> I<00:03:22.010> realize

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:22.459 
now I went 20 years before I realize

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:24.880 
now I went 20 years before I realize
women<00:03:22.820> it's<00:03:23.000> not<00:03:23.030> the<00:03:23.270> walking<00:03:23.739> it's<00:03:24.739> not

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:24.890 
women it's not the walking it's not

00:03:24.890 --> 00:03:26.440 
women it's not the walking it's not
riding<00:03:25.190> the<00:03:25.400> bike<00:03:25.610> it's<00:03:26.120> not<00:03:26.270> even

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:26.450 
riding the bike it's not even

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:28.870 
riding the bike it's not even
necessarily<00:03:26.810> for<00:03:27.620> status<00:03:28.040> post<00:03:28.160> ACL<00:03:28.580> injury

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:28.880 
necessarily for status post ACL injury

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.880 
necessarily for status post ACL injury
it's<00:03:29.060> not<00:03:29.180> even<00:03:29.360> necessary<00:03:29.750> the<00:03:29.840> ranging<00:03:30.410> it's

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:30.890 
it's not even necessary the ranging it's

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:32.740 
it's not even necessary the ranging it's
it's<00:03:31.340> clearing<00:03:31.730> the<00:03:31.880> congestion<00:03:32.239> that's<00:03:32.570> why

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:32.750 
it's clearing the congestion that's why

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:34.449 
it's clearing the congestion that's why
that<00:03:33.230> cyclones<00:03:33.650> become<00:03:33.890> such<00:03:34.070> an<00:03:34.190> important

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 
that cyclones become such an important

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:39.699 
that cyclones become such an important

doing a lot for you just want to give
you<00:03:45.920> set<00:03:46.130> up<00:03:46.250> key<00:03:46.760> concept<00:03:47.300> thing<00:03:47.510> thinking

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:48.050 
you set up key concept thing thinking

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:50.080 
you set up key concept thing thinking

pausing<00:04:20.579> is<00:04:21.180> causing<00:04:21.660> an<00:04:21.750> inference<00:04:22.019> of<00:04:22.229> flow

pausing is causing an inference of flow

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.939 
pausing is causing an inference of flow
in<00:04:23.060> so<00:04:24.060> we're<00:04:24.330> increasing<00:04:24.780> the<00:04:25.080> flow<00:04:25.320> in<00:04:25.590> with

in so we're increasing the flow in with
the<00:04:26.759> groceries<00:04:27.270> and<00:04:27.440> the<00:04:28.440> garbage<00:04:28.860> is<00:04:29.070> going

the groceries and the garbage is going
out<00:04:29.550> simultaneously<00:04:30.139> so<00:04:31.139> get<00:04:31.440> a<00:04:31.470> lot<00:04:31.620> of<00:04:31.710> this

if you brought in all good and the bad

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:56.719 
if you brought in all good and the bad
didn't<00:04:54.030> leave<00:04:54.740> drink<00:04:55.740> would<00:04:55.919> be<00:04:56.070> for<00:04:56.460> a<00:04:56.490> mess

00:04:56.719 --> 00:04:56.729 
didn't leave drink would be for a mess

00:04:56.729 --> 00:04:59.960 
didn't leave drink would be for a mess
what<00:04:57.000> a<00:04:57.030> mess<00:04:57.090> so<00:04:57.840> whoever<00:04:58.380> did<00:04:58.770> it<00:04:58.979> was<00:04:59.220> really

00:04:59.960 --> 00:04:59.970 
what a mess so whoever did it was really

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:02.659 
what a mess so whoever did it was really
in<00:05:00.630> back<00:05:00.960> the<00:05:01.110> same<00:05:01.380> muscle<00:05:01.860> activation<00:05:02.520> it

00:05:02.659 --> 00:05:02.669 
in back the same muscle activation it

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:05.149 
in back the same muscle activation it
brings<00:05:02.910> in<00:05:03.060> the<00:05:03.150> good<00:05:03.330> stuff<00:05:03.590> Santa<00:05:04.590> faz<00:05:04.770> takes

00:05:05.149 --> 00:05:05.159 
brings in the good stuff Santa faz takes

00:05:05.159 --> 00:05:06.589 
brings in the good stuff Santa faz takes
out<00:05:05.340> the<00:05:05.460> dancer<00:05:05.909> and<00:05:06.090> if<00:05:06.180> you<00:05:06.270> go<00:05:06.360> one<00:05:06.570> step

00:05:06.589 --> 00:05:06.599 
out the dancer and if you go one step

00:05:06.599 --> 00:05:09.200 
out the dancer and if you go one step
further<00:05:07.220> sometimes<00:05:08.220> it<00:05:08.610> causes<00:05:08.789> enough

00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:09.210 
further sometimes it causes enough

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:11.450 
further sometimes it causes enough
tension<00:05:09.630> or<00:05:09.960> rhodium<00:05:10.380> on<00:05:10.470> the<00:05:10.620> tissue<00:05:10.800> the

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:15.750 
help in my motion is lotion yeah did I

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:17.899 
help in my motion is lotion yeah did I
didn't<00:05:16.409> make<00:05:16.470> that<00:05:16.530> up<00:05:16.680> the<00:05:16.860> pressure<00:05:17.099> that's

00:05:17.899 --> 00:05:17.909 
didn't make that up the pressure that's

00:05:17.909 --> 00:05:19.760 
didn't make that up the pressure that's
good<00:05:18.120> I<00:05:18.330> did<00:05:18.810> it<00:05:18.870> look<00:05:19.020> it's<00:05:19.440> about<00:05:19.500> movement

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:19.770 
good I did it look it's about movement

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:21.379
