00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:01.530 
few months ago it looked like he might

00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:03.649 
few months ago it looked like he might
be<00:00:01.709> averse<00:00:02.040> to<00:00:02.070> do<00:00:02.370> I<00:00:02.970> just<00:00:03.210> wondered<00:00:03.480> if<00:00:03.570> you

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:03.659 
be averse to do I just wondered if you

be averse to do I just wondered if you
could<00:00:03.720> talk<00:00:03.899> a<00:00:03.959> little<00:00:04.170> bit<00:00:04.350> about<00:00:04.529> your

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:04.950 
could talk a little bit about your

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:07.340 
could talk a little bit about your
deliberations<00:00:05.700> and<00:00:05.970> how<00:00:06.210> you're<00:00:06.870> thinking<00:00:06.899> of

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:07.350 
deliberations and how you're thinking of

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.070 
deliberations and how you're thinking of
off<00:00:07.529> on<00:00:07.799> that<00:00:07.980> were<00:00:08.820> their<00:00:09.080> conversations

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
off on that were their conversations

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.419 
off on that were their conversations
that<00:00:10.290> were<00:00:10.410> important<00:00:10.769> to<00:00:10.800> you<00:00:10.950> were<00:00:11.280> there

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
that were important to you were there

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.129 
that were important to you were there
things<00:00:11.580> that<00:00:11.730> you've<00:00:11.969> read<00:00:12.179> that<00:00:12.570> influenced

things that you've read that influenced

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:18.279 
things that you've read that influenced
your<00:00:13.230> thinking<00:00:14.839> as<00:00:15.839> everybody<00:00:16.350> here<00:00:16.470> knows

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:18.289 
your thinking as everybody here knows

00:00:18.289 --> 00:00:25.440 
your thinking as everybody here knows
last<00:00:19.289> year<00:00:20.900> upon

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:25.450 

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:29.070 

a<00:00:25.830> long<00:00:26.830> period<00:00:27.250> of<00:00:27.340> reflection<00:00:27.430> I<00:00:28.090> concluded

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:29.080 
a long period of reflection I concluded

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:35.250 
a long period of reflection I concluded
that<00:00:31.349> we<00:00:32.349> cannot<00:00:33.120> discriminate<00:00:34.260> against

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:35.260 
that we cannot discriminate against

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:36.720 
that we cannot discriminate against
same-sex<00:00:35.500> couples<00:00:36.130> when<00:00:36.310> it<00:00:36.400> comes<00:00:36.580> to

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:36.730 
same-sex couples when it comes to

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.890 
same-sex couples when it comes to
marriage

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:40.900 

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.770 

that<00:00:41.470> the<00:00:41.590> basic<00:00:41.980> principle<00:00:42.550> that<00:00:43.030> America<00:00:43.600> is

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:43.780 
that the basic principle that America is

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.040 
that the basic principle that America is
founded<00:00:44.440> on<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:45.640> idea<00:00:45.670> that<00:00:46.000> we're<00:00:46.930> all

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:47.050 
founded on the idea that we're all

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:53.210 
founded on the idea that we're all
created<00:00:47.290> equal<00:00:48.750> applies<00:00:49.750> to<00:00:51.390> everybody

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:53.220 
created equal applies to everybody

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:56.070 
created equal applies to everybody
regardless<00:00:54.220> of<00:00:54.700> sexual<00:00:54.940> orientation<00:00:55.120> as<00:00:55.690> well

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:56.080 
regardless of sexual orientation as well

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:59.550 
regardless of sexual orientation as well
as<00:00:56.230> race<00:00:56.920> or<00:00:57.250> gender<00:00:57.280> or<00:00:58.110> religion<00:00:59.110> or

as race or gender or religion or

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:05.910 
as race or gender or religion or
ethnicity<00:01:00.690> and<00:01:04.199> you<00:01:05.199> know<00:01:05.260> I<00:01:05.290> think<00:01:05.410> that<00:01:05.770> the

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:05.920 
ethnicity and you know I think that the

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:07.530 
ethnicity and you know I think that the
same<00:01:06.310> evolution<00:01:06.850> that<00:01:06.940> I've<00:01:07.060> gone<00:01:07.210> through<00:01:07.270> is

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:07.540 
same evolution that I've gone through is

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:09.390 
same evolution that I've gone through is
an<00:01:07.660> evolution<00:01:08.140> that<00:01:08.170> the<00:01:08.350> country<00:01:08.530> as<00:01:09.220> a<00:01:09.250> whole

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:09.400 
an evolution that the country as a whole

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.220 
an evolution that the country as a whole
has<00:01:09.700> gone<00:01:09.910> through<00:01:10.090> and<00:01:10.690> I<00:01:10.780> think<00:01:10.990> it<00:01:11.080> is<00:01:11.110> a

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:11.230 
has gone through and I think it is a

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:17.420 
has gone through and I think it is a
profoundly<00:01:11.770> positive<00:01:11.980> thing<00:01:15.360> so<00:01:16.360> that<00:01:16.390> when

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
profoundly positive thing so that when

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.680 
profoundly positive thing so that when
the<00:01:18.430> supreme<00:01:18.700> court<00:01:18.940> essentially<00:01:19.240> called<00:01:19.570> the

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:19.690 
the supreme court essentially called the

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:21.930 
the supreme court essentially called the
question<00:01:20.050> by<00:01:20.229> taking<00:01:20.619> this<00:01:20.770> case<00:01:21.610> about

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:21.940 
question by taking this case about

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:24.900 
question by taking this case about
California's<00:01:22.690> law<00:01:22.869> I<00:01:23.770> didn't<00:01:24.340> feel<00:01:24.400> like<00:01:24.460> that

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:24.910 
California's law I didn't feel like that

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:25.890 
California's law I didn't feel like that
was<00:01:25.180> something<00:01:25.300> that<00:01:25.630> this<00:01:25.840> administration

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:25.900 
was something that this administration

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:29.609 
was something that this administration
could<00:01:26.800> avoid<00:01:27.150> I<00:01:28.150> felt<00:01:28.930> it<00:01:29.020> was<00:01:29.110> important<00:01:29.590> for

00:01:29.609 --> 00:01:29.619 
could avoid I felt it was important for

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:34.650 
could avoid I felt it was important for
us<00:01:29.890> to<00:01:29.920> articulate<00:01:30.880> what<00:01:31.830> I<00:01:32.830> believe<00:01:33.700> and<00:01:34.150> what

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:34.660 
us to articulate what I believe and what

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:37.910 
us to articulate what I believe and what
this<00:01:34.810> administration<00:01:34.930> stands<00:01:35.680> for<00:01:35.920> and

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920 
this administration stands for and

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.270 
this administration stands for and
although<00:01:38.920> I<00:01:39.130> do<00:01:39.190> think<00:01:39.400> that<00:01:40.800> we're<00:01:41.800> seeing<00:01:42.040> on

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.280 
although I do think that we're seeing on

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.330 
although I do think that we're seeing on
a<00:01:42.310> state-by-state<00:01:42.670> basis<00:01:44.100> progress<00:01:45.100> being

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.340 
a state-by-state basis progress being

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.500 
a state-by-state basis progress being
made<00:01:45.430> more<00:01:46.390> and<00:01:46.480> more<00:01:46.630> states<00:01:47.280> recognizing

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:48.510 
made more and more states recognizing

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:51.960 
made more and more states recognizing
same-sex<00:01:49.830> couples<00:01:50.830> and<00:01:51.160> giving<00:01:51.730> them<00:01:51.850> the

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:51.970 
same-sex couples and giving them the

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:57.149 
same-sex couples and giving them the
opportunity<00:01:52.000> to<00:01:52.510> marry<00:01:52.950> and<00:01:54.930> maintain<00:01:56.159> all

the<00:01:57.520> benefits<00:01:58.360> of<00:01:58.510> marriage<00:01:58.720> that

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
the benefits of marriage that

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.410 
the benefits of marriage that
heterosexual<00:02:01.540> couples<00:02:01.840> do<00:02:03.060> when<00:02:04.060> the<00:02:04.150> Supreme

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420 
heterosexual couples do when the Supreme

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:09.389 
heterosexual couples do when the Supreme
Court<00:02:04.770> tasks<00:02:06.450> do<00:02:07.450> you<00:02:07.540> think<00:02:07.810> that<00:02:08.399> the

have a good reason it should be struck

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.869 
have a good reason it should be struck
down<00:03:50.049> that's<00:03:50.319> the<00:03:50.409> core<00:03:50.709> principle<00:03:51.220> and<00:03:51.489> apply

00:03:51.869 --> 00:03:51.879 
down that's the core principle and apply

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:57.089 
down that's the core principle and apply
to<00:03:52.030> this<00:03:52.389> case<00:03:53.310> now<00:03:54.310> what<00:03:54.609> the<00:03:55.680> the<00:03:56.680> court<00:03:56.949> may

00:03:57.089 --> 00:03:57.099 
to this case now what the the court may

00:03:57.099 --> 00:03:58.949 
to this case now what the the court may
decide<00:03:57.280> that<00:03:57.519> if<00:03:58.060> it<00:03:58.239> doesn't<00:03:58.479> apply<00:03:58.659> in<00:03:58.870> this

decide that if it doesn't apply in this

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:01.199 
decide that if it doesn't apply in this
case<00:03:59.019> it<00:03:59.349> probably<00:03:59.379> can't<00:03:59.889> apply<00:04:00.159> in<00:04:00.370> any<00:04:00.909> case

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:01.209 
case it probably can't apply in any case

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:04.050 
case it probably can't apply in any case
there's<00:04:02.049> no<00:04:02.199> good<00:04:02.349> reason<00:04:02.530> for<00:04:02.889> it<00:04:02.949> that's<00:04:03.549> if

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.060 
there's no good reason for it that's if

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:06.119 
there's no good reason for it that's if
I<00:04:04.180> were<00:04:04.329> on<00:04:04.359> the<00:04:04.540> court<00:04:04.810> that<00:04:05.530> probably<00:04:05.859> the

00:04:06.119 --> 00:04:06.129 
I were on the court that probably the

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:08.879 
I were on the court that probably the
view<00:04:06.489> that<00:04:06.519> I'd<00:04:06.729> put<00:04:06.939> forward<00:04:07.229> but<00:04:08.229> but<00:04:08.769> I'm

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:08.889 
view that I'd put forward but but I'm

00:04:08.889 --> 00:04:11.460 
view that I'd put forward but but I'm
not<00:04:09.069> a<00:04:09.099> judge<00:04:09.340> I'm<00:04:09.519> the<00:04:09.639> president<00:04:10.060> so<00:04:10.470> the

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:11.470 
not a judge I'm the president so the

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:14.129 
not a judge I'm the president so the
basic<00:04:11.829> principle<00:04:12.310> though<00:04:12.459> is<00:04:12.989> let's<00:04:13.989> treat

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:14.139 
basic principle though is let's treat
