00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.539 
don't think it'll show up on the video
very<00:03:37.549> well<00:03:37.879> you<00:03:38.060> know<00:03:38.209> because<00:03:38.599> dark<00:03:39.549> really

00:03:40.539 --> 00:03:40.549 
very well you know because dark really

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:42.129 
very well you know because dark really
really<00:03:40.730> really<00:03:40.849> bad<00:03:41.299> it's<00:03:41.540> right<00:03:41.780> over<00:03:41.810> the

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:42.139 
really really bad it's right over the

00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:43.360 
really really bad it's right over the
tree<00:03:42.349> that's<00:03:42.500> right<00:03:42.769> in<00:03:42.889> the<00:03:43.010> center<00:03:43.340> here

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
tree that's right in the center here

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.640 
tree that's right in the center here
it's<00:03:43.730> really<00:03:44.120> thin<00:03:44.359> but<00:03:44.720> you<00:03:44.810> can<00:03:44.959> barely<00:03:45.230> see

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:45.650 
it's really thin but you can barely see

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:47.349 
it's really thin but you can barely see
it<00:03:45.769> I<00:03:45.950> can't<00:03:46.250> see<00:03:46.400> any<00:03:46.549> more<00:03:46.790> thinking<00:03:47.150> from

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:47.359 
it I can't see any more thinking from

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:49.539 
it I can't see any more thinking from
good<00:03:47.540> now<00:03:47.769> and<00:03:48.769> that<00:03:48.950> one<00:03:49.129> over<00:03:49.159> there<00:03:49.400> is

00:03:49.539 --> 00:03:49.549 
good now and that one over there is

00:03:49.549 --> 00:03:51.970 
good now and that one over there is
definitely<00:03:50.000> gone<00:03:50.299> but<00:03:50.840> I<00:03:50.870> guarantee<00:03:51.530> there'll

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:51.980 
definitely gone but I guarantee there'll

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:54.939 
definitely gone but I guarantee there'll
be<00:03:52.040> more<00:03:52.340> okay
