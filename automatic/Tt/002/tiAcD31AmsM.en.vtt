00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 premise today will have had to register a 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:06.810
 unfortunately another video is my voice 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:12.000
 then the video related to 

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:14.519
 this man should come out around 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.320
 next week to cover the hole 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.460
 left however decided to 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.250
 record something 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.560
 a kind of half flog so as not to 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.180
 already delay my second video in 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.920
 this sampled video was a little in 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.630
 what is the world of video games 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.590
 I had promised myself not to do it on the way 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:34.140
 of the multitude of youtube channels that 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.149
 already they speak and straparlano but be 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.640
 do not worry because I will not review individuals 

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:40.800
 videogames but I will talk about an event 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.160
 linked to them 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.160
 let's start 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:51.430
 well 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:55.739
 a few days ago I was shooting in 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.940
 Internet searching for information 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.649
 my next video 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.359
 when I came across an article 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:02.760
 particular concerning the prize the 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.489
 golden dragon this show tip 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:06.600
 be the first official prize 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:07.170
 Italian concerning the world of 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.390
 video games 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:12.270
 this event will take place April 16 in 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:15.000
 Milan and no other company will be affiliated 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.409
 event really good thing though 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.149
 we are giving a mosque passes in the 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.369
 serious events would not be me 

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:21.450
 really enjoyed finding an event of 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.330
 this scope 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.530
 stuck in a cola of the Lucca comics 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:28.170
 rather than the mango flax from the fiavet 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:30.240
 novegro mainly because those things 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.490
 talk about comics must stop 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.830
 get involved and video games really 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:38.880
 even if luca comi is called luca comics 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:41.100
 however, I know it 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.959
 intrigued probed look at me for a moment 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.740
 the web page of these associations 

00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:48.240
 this award and I've seen things that 

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.670
 I didn't like them very sincerely 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.850
 thus equipping me with modern means 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.739
 of hi tech equipment technology 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.200
 I have marked some things or things 

00:01:55.739 --> 00:02:00.390
 details that I will go to tell me then the 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.509
 Golden Dragon Award was organized 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.310
 from I read from jesi which is the association of 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:08.910
 Italian video game developer towers 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.920
 and will take place on 16 April in Milan 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.940
 sponsored by mediaworld and the 

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.370
 repubblica.it 

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:17.400
 the choice of video games to be awarded yes 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.090
 performs with a three-jury system la 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.120
 before 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:23.310
 obviously I read a critical jury 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:25.110
 presided over by jaime of alessandro that a 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.810
 journalist of the republic a 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.489
 journalist all round and is linked to 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.500
 world of videogames but speaks anyway 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:36.060
 of a bit of everything done historical services 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:37.420
 made the person of political services 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.459
 culture in short 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:42.880
 and here the first jury note is the jury 

00:02:39.459 --> 00:02:46.630
 composed of courier representatives from 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:54.040
 evening the sun 24 hours the press and the 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:56.530
 sports gazette then there is the jury 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.930
 technique that is composed of Spanish paulos 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:01.690
 which products manager mediaworld 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:03.550
 concerning mediaword video games 

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:05.380
 of the sponsor comes a jury to come 

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:09.130
 presided over by one of its exponents 

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:10.630
 rightly and here is the second sore point 

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:12.269
 if this is called giulia and technique 

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:14.400
 because it was composed of journalists 

00:03:12.269 --> 00:03:17.080
 of sector magazines 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:19.540
 the jury will take that one first 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:21.340
 oh well let's go ahead 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:23.230
 the third is the popular jury that aims 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.900
 made up of all the people who are 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:28.090
 enter the site of the golden dragon and have 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.709
 voted the videogames that they were 

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:32.290
 proposed as the best game of the year I 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:33.280
 of the xbox game in the best play3 game e 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:35.769
 etc 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:37.690
 the popular jury besides this is 

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:40.360
 also reads the popular jury a 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:43.570
 juror who will be physically in 

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:45.579
 vote on 16 April in Milan and am 

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:48.010
 remained that surely surprised when 

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:49.870
 I found out what a popular measure it will not be 

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:52.630
 other than francesco miceli or between 

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:54.519
 house of the channel we talk about video games 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:56.170
 so we can say that at least worn 

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:58.390
 will have seen the games he will go to 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:02.109
 discuss now that you spoke to me from 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:03.820
 jury we can talk about the awards to 

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:05.200
 criticism is given the task of choosing 

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:08.260
 the best games of the following 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:11.560
 categories best column setting 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:14.120
 sound graphics multiplayer gameplay not 

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:17.060
 protagonists of the show 

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:19.519
 international script lindt send 

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:20.930
 Italian then poor journalist of the 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:23.650
 sports gazette will be in front of you 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:26.720
 Italian teeth independent productions 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:29.260
 including having to choose the best mi 

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:31.970
 he knows he'll miss the soccer field 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:33.320
 small surprise among the candidates to the 

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:35.750
 best character award not 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:39.080
 protagonist we find catherine of 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:41.419
 catherine game I was amazed 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:43.580
 because I thought it was not just anyone 

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:47.110
 although obviously it can be the last 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:49.250
 time of then we will hear about usual 

00:04:47.110 --> 00:04:51.860
 however listing the categories comes 

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:55.310
 spontaneous the question to his ep 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:57.880
 the jury composed of people with 

00:04:55.310 --> 00:05:00.229
 The world of video games has nothing to do with it 

00:04:57.880 --> 00:05:02.810
 how do you get him to evaluate stuff of 

00:05:00.229 --> 00:05:04.580
 kind any programmer would do 

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:06.380
 struggling to evaluate games for these 

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:08.720
 features 

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:10.190
 especially multiplayer where to 

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:12.020
 have a correct assessment if with 

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:13.310
 at least an hour of play 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:15.050
 you can see us teacher running in the evening 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:17.950
 get to play for an hour for it 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:19.910
 understand if the multiplayer 

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:22.520
 not me 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:24.349
 the technical jury will be called instead a 

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:26.330
 vote for the best fighting game 

00:05:24.349 --> 00:05:28.070
 shooter the best casual game e 

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:30.470
 best role-playing game the best game 

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:33.380
 of racing the best action video game 

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:35.419
 it's the best sports game you couldn't 

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:37.789
 give them to the other jury, maybe exchange 

00:05:35.419 --> 00:05:40.430
 be of atoms these arguments are a 

00:05:37.789 --> 00:05:44.500
 a little easier, you just need ten minutes 

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:48.580
 game to understand how they are made 

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:51.190
 okay small personal parenthesis in the 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:54.370
 fighting there is that cagata a 

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:56.110
 monstrous of the last dream game dreams 

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:59.350
 or star battle royale I think it's called 

00:05:56.110 --> 00:06:01.570
 so please is a copy of the game 

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:02.740
 nintendo and what's more it is done wrong 

00:06:01.570 --> 00:06:05.620
 really 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:09.070
 we could have avoided the public jury 

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:11.850
 instead it is called to vote indeed it already has 

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:15.610
 voted best xbox video games 

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:17.710
 playstation 3 nintendo ds and san vito e 

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:19.090
 best video game of the year 

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:21.070
 apart from having half the idea of ​​these 

00:06:19.090 --> 00:06:23.740
 hard folk don't really like it because 

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:25.870
 honestly the popular jury already has 

00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:28.510
 voted by buying and buying i 

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:29.770
 games we're talking about is 2 ago 

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:31.960
 above all rotate the prize of the 

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:34.450
 best game of the year to people who 

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:36.700
 maybe from two games a year are 18 

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:38.680
 cocoto battlefield and they don't have 

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:40.900
 experience on other things 

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:43.360
 it is sadness especially because among the 

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:45.040
 best games of the year code the thing 

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:46.510
 that made me more angry was 

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:48.669
 which in the categories as best 

00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:51.520
 videogame xbox playstation and so on 

00:06:48.669 --> 00:06:53.500
 were present of the multiplatform is 

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:55.810
 possible that in the whole of 2012 they are not 

00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:56.680
 come out quite exclusive to create 

00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:59.260
 these categories 

00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:01.900
 ok microsoft with xbox a tirate 

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:04.750
 out of the mountain, however, make the effort also because 

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:06.910
 to see win on xbox and plate and gods 

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:09.409
 ie multi-platform games that are 

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:12.709
 also present on other consoles 

00:07:09.409 --> 00:07:14.929
 is very sad in conclusion 

00:07:12.709 --> 00:07:16.330
 excellent the idea of ​​starting a project e 

00:07:14.929 --> 00:07:18.739
 like the golden dragon here in Italy 

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:21.349
 really great we are in the first year 

00:07:18.739 --> 00:07:22.729
 so the jury can be there but 

00:07:21.349 --> 00:07:25.610
 must put this prize is 

00:07:22.729 --> 00:07:27.259
 really badly set up with this 

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:29.689
 I greet you, I apologize for my tone 

00:07:27.259 --> 00:07:32.929
 of indiscretion I leave you anyway

 some links related to this award 

00:07:32.929 --> 00:07:38.389
