00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:31.489
 Today 

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:33.190
 Dmitry Sands 

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:34.820
 news 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:37.820
 enough 

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.760
 and here is a step back 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.920
 hence the strange thing about him 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.020
 particular 

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:49.710
 all machines are not 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.520
 such a girl eastern 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.910
 country 

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:57.970
 while reading the article 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:59.630
 because that 

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:02.630
 in particular, 6 s 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.970
 found and today the third part of matches in 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.970
 literally, by the way 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:14.570
 now you need to know your place 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.160
 then here is the consumer here I am 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:20.850
 I offer you him technically 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.020
 what the road makes it all clear 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.360
 need to answer once say 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:28.900
 it is very small 

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:30.600
 stop violence 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.229
 now we must learn to distinguish words in 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:35.720
 favor another player in the lineup 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.500
 Here look I can not do with it 

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:41.630
 now data annually 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.590
 to 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.590
 concepts took the reins of grandfather and 

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:50.120
 m on it was nowhere to be no more 

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:53.120
 less to 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.120
 purchase tickets will be valid 

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:59.190
 in the west there in civilian clothes 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:01.220
 to 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.890
 will stand the office of the eyes of the fleet and then 

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.520
 when everything is thought up what to answer 

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.029
 it's a mess in the afternoon but more 

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:13.029
 it seems knowing what she wanted 

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:16.409
 if interested to meet 

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:17.039
 distances 

00:02:17.039 --> 00:02:19.439
 in the east but kind if the guy is reliable 

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:22.359
 tactics do not kill everyone where and 

00:02:22.359 --> 00:02:23.589
 over the counter 

00:02:23.589 --> 00:02:25.299
 recall freedom 

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:28.809
 rubles what I think is not very recent 15 

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:31.809
 days worked 

00:02:32.389 --> 00:02:34.289
 why after 

00:02:34.289 --> 00:02:35.939
 to referendum 

00:02:35.939 --> 00:02:38.939
 guy at 2 2 million barrels 

00:02:40.499 --> 00:02:42.229
 purchasing debates
