00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
know if you notice it's a lot wider than

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:44.299

the stock stance you see here sticking

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.240 
the stock stance you see here sticking
out<00:00:44.460> of<00:00:44.550> the<00:00:44.640> fenders<00:00:45.559> we<00:00:46.559> just<00:00:46.739> swapped<00:00:47.039> the

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
out of the fenders we just swapped the

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:50.360 
out of the fenders we just swapped the
front<00:00:47.520> tires<00:00:48.200> so<00:00:49.200> technically<00:00:50.129> they're<00:00:50.250> on

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
front tires so technically they're on

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:55.010 
front tires so technically they're on
the<00:00:50.760> hub<00:00:50.940> is<00:00:51.180> a<00:00:52.250> on<00:00:53.250> bag<00:00:53.520> virtual<00:00:53.850> driver<00:00:54.030> so<00:00:54.870> it

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
the hub is a on bag virtual driver so it

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.250 
the hub is a on bag virtual driver so it
extends<00:00:55.410> it's<00:00:56.039> a<00:00:56.160> wider<00:00:56.340> whatever<00:00:57.079> the<00:00:58.079> back

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
extends it's a wider whatever the back

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.849 
extends it's a wider whatever the back
has<00:00:58.530> two<00:00:58.829> inch<00:00:59.000> spacers<00:01:00.230> with<00:01:01.230> a<00:01:01.260> bigger<00:01:01.530> size

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.940 
here we go we notice when we first got
there's<00:01:08.130> a<00:01:08.220> lot<00:01:08.340> of<00:01:08.490> slop<00:01:08.729> in<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:08.970> front<00:01:09.210> end

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
nice you know no rips said we actually

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.860 
nice you know no rips said we actually
did<00:03:00.650> the<00:03:01.120> things<00:03:02.120> from<00:03:02.300> the<00:03:02.390> cold

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
did the things from the cold

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:04.900 
did the things from the cold
they<00:03:03.140> were<00:03:03.200> the<00:03:03.470> seats<00:03:03.710> rip<00:03:03.950> I<00:03:04.310> think<00:03:04.820> we

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:04.910 
they were the seats rip I think we

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:07.570 
they were the seats rip I think we
caught<00:03:05.180> it<00:03:05.800> with<00:03:06.800> our<00:03:06.920> boots<00:03:07.070> or<00:03:07.340> something

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:07.580 
caught it with our boots or something

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:10.540 
caught it with our boots or something
like<00:03:07.640> that<00:03:07.820> so<00:03:08.060> that's<00:03:08.870> what<00:03:09.020> happened<00:03:09.550> okay

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:10.550 
like that so that's what happened okay

not the wheel bearings the axle bearings

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:00.460 
not the wheel bearings the axle bearings
as<00:03:58.489> a<00:03:58.550> big<00:03:58.790> project<00:03:59.060> well<00:03:59.750> the<00:03:59.989> one<00:04:00.110> bearing

change of really expensive and then also

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:10.479 
change of really expensive and then also
it<00:04:08.450> took<00:04:08.630> part<00:04:08.900> to<00:04:08.959> break<00:04:09.170> a<00:04:09.530> drum<00:04:09.980> break<00:04:10.220> here

it took part to break a drum break here

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:14.110 
it took part to break a drum break here
because<00:04:10.700> it<00:04:10.820> seized<00:04:11.030> up<00:04:11.209> got<00:04:12.050> that<00:04:12.260> working<00:04:13.120> we

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:14.120 
because it seized up got that working we

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:17.050 
because it seized up got that working we
uh<00:04:14.230> resprayed<00:04:15.230> the<00:04:15.410> back<00:04:15.800> cover<00:04:16.070> there<00:04:16.310> and

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:23.630 
never put a clear coat on it so start

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:26.650 
never put a clear coat on it so start
rusting<00:04:23.870> again<00:04:24.230> so<00:04:24.700> we<00:04:25.700> gotta<00:04:25.850> polish<00:04:26.390> it<00:04:26.630> up

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:26.660 
rusting again so we gotta polish it up

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:29.260 
rusting again so we gotta polish it up
