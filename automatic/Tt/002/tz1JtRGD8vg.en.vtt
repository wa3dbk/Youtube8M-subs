00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:11.700
 hello thank you for being in a new video 

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:15.030
 of this channel this time we have the 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:17.880
 review of samsung galaxy 3 the brother 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.339
 minor of all the new line of samsung 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.349
 which is focused on the front camera 

00:00:20.339 --> 00:00:25.019
 which is for selfish and in the design already 

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:26.759
 which is a thin and very metallic design 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:28.890
 light so let's talk a lot 

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:31.529
 things about him we are going to give some opinions 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:34.109
 interesting and let's start talking about 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.300
 design as I told you at the beginning this new 

00:00:34.109 --> 00:00:37.739
 samsung line is focused on a 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.949
 premium design as they call it 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:43.530
 because it is completely besides metal 

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:46.140
 be a very thin design and also very 

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:48.989
 light from the front we're going to 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.960
 have the 5 megapixel camera in addition 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.359
 of the handset and the brand logo 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.670
 what is samsung after we are going to have the 

00:00:54.359 --> 00:01:00.120
 screen that is super amoled with 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:02.969
 4.5 inch qhd resolution so 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:05.160
 he is the smallest brother of all the 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.020
 series and if we go below we are going to 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:10.109
 find the home button 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.000
 of the multitasking and back buttons that 

00:01:10.109 --> 00:01:14.070
 they are capacitive and if they are retro 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.479
 illuminated by the part of the right 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.820
 let's find the power button 

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.100
 and classic off of samsung the 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:22.380
 location there and also a slot for 

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:25.439
 microsd card and another slot for 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:28.020
 sim cards in this case is nano sim 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:30.659
 there is also a duos model where 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.030
 tray for micro sd you can use it 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:35.280
 both for micro sd or for nano sim 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.200
 one of the two if we go to the side 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.599
 left we will find the keypad 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.030
 of volume and a metallic design as 

00:01:39.599 --> 00:01:43.939
 we said it for the part above not 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.869
 we will find nothing more than a microphone 

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:47.970
 mainly for the cancellation of 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.459
 noise and if we go to the bottom 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:53.489
 let's find the exit for the 

00:01:50.459 --> 00:01:54.450
 hearing aids and the microusb port in addition to 

00:01:53.489 --> 00:01:56.220
 another microphone 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.349
 let's go straight to the back that 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.810
 it's metal too, the truth feels 

00:01:58.349 --> 00:02:02.610
 very very well in the hand we have there the 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.250
 camera that is 8 megapixels 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.829
 accompanied by its led flash and speaker 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.780
 there next to a location that maybe not 

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:11.430
 we like it so much but we'll see more 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.170
 go ahead how is it like you see in 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.599
 design terms is very good 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:17.730
 it's a device that has an aesthetic 

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:19.770
 very high now let's talk about the 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.410
 multimedia aspect where we always put 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:24.510
 to the screen and the speaker to see what 

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:26.730
 such you could enjoy for example see 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:28.080
 videos on a device like this like 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.860
 I said a while ago the resolution of the 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:35.450
 screen is not hd is qhd and is 540 x 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:38.250
 960 pixels in a size of 4.5 inches 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:41.610
 The technology used is super amoled 

00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:44.040
 so it has very good color levels 

00:02:41.610 --> 00:02:45.810
 high the color looks very intense and a 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.970
 contrast also very high so the 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.950
 picture looks very unfortunately the 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:51.780
 resolution is not that high but also 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.299
 the size of the screen is not so 

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:56.310
 large therefore the result is a 

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:58.350
 pretty good screen with good 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.480
 viewing angles and also has good 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:02.790
 visibility under sunlight though 

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:04.730
 not as much as a ips technology the 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.989
 speaker is located in the back 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:09.000
 something that we do not like very much because 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:11.730
 moment of watching a video the audio will 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.440
 shoot backwards and not towards you 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.060
 that being a very thin design 

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:17.340
 also the speaker is not so powerful 

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:19.350
 but if it's clear enough so 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.090
 we will give you a medium term 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:22.650
 let's see just a little video 

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:27.200
 of sample although obviously it is not 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:27.200
 see it and hear it live on video 

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:50.750
 it's time to talk about the 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:52.400
 cameras of this device because it's in 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:54.620
 what more it is there focus on what 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:57.170
 also more highlights a device the 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:59.989
 line to in this case the 3 account with 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:01.520
 a 5 megapixel front camera for 

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:03.950
 that you can do a very selfish 

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:06.080
 pretty and also has a pretty lens 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:09.200
 wider than the others so it captures 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:11.180
 more information in a photograph and 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:13.130
 also with 5 megapixels you achieve a level 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:14.870
 high detail so the camera 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:16.940
 frontal is the best you're going to 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:18.859
 find in the market still in the ranges 

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:21.620
 high and if we go to the back camera 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:24.050
 is an 8 megapixel camera capable of 

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.700
 record in full hd so it's also 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:27.500
 very good camera and you're seeing some 

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:29.450
 images shows the effect of 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:31.790
 Depth of field is fine 

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:33.850
 got the truth is a very camera 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:36.110
 good of the best I 've tried 

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:37.970
 recently also the software that 

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:39.590
 accompanies the a3's camera is 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:43.130
 quite complete you have different 

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:45.320
 capture modes either panoramic hdr 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:46.970
 in short it has many ways as always 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:48.650
 samsung puts him and also the camera 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:51.050
 frontal for example so you can 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:53.360
 Take a picture simply by showing your 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:55.009
 hand and the timer is activated 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:56.599
 do not have to be stretching for 

00:04:55.009 --> 00:04:58.430
 take the picture and press the 

00:04:56.599 --> 00:05:00.439
 shutter so how do you see on camera 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:01.939
 it is also quite well the time has come 

00:05:00.439 --> 00:05:04.159
 time to talk about the software of 

00:05:01.939 --> 00:05:06.289
 galaxy 3 and in this aspect always 

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:08.419
 also samsung adds some functions 

00:05:06.289 --> 00:05:10.250
 extra on your device in addition to 

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:13.939
 change the appearance of android so 

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:15.650
 we have android 4.4 kitkat and about the the 

00:05:13.939 --> 00:05:17.389
 layer touch guys that changes to the 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:20.210
 obvious appearance of android some 

00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:22.159
 Extra functions are for example the mode 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:24.199
 ultra energy saving where you can 

00:05:22.159 --> 00:05:26.090
 disable many services to save 

00:05:24.199 --> 00:05:27.919
 energy the screen goes blank and 

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:30.710
 black leaves you available only 

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:32.569
 a few applications but you're going to 

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:34.129
 save lots of battery the multi 

00:05:32.569 --> 00:05:36.050
 window is not in this 

00:05:34.129 --> 00:05:38.000
 device and it makes some sense 

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:40.189
 because the screen is already quite 

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.259
 small enough to open two applications 

00:05:40.189 --> 00:05:44.750
 at the same time the case of the camera is 

00:05:42.259 --> 00:05:46.909
 another one in which samsung adds his own 

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:49.099
 software where are you going to find many 

00:05:46.909 --> 00:05:51.050
 capture modes for example you can 

00:05:49.099 --> 00:05:53.779
 capture using the voice tell 

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:55.879
 capture or showing the hand and also 

00:05:53.779 --> 00:05:57.500
 lets you change several values ​​like the 

00:05:55.879 --> 00:05:59.750
 did the exhibition and the balance of 

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:00.830
 whites we'll see in the video of tips and 

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:03.050
 tricks some 

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:05.000
 Extra detail that brings the software 

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:07.340
 last let's talk about the performance of 

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.590
 this device and let's give some 

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:11.900
 of its specifications has a 

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:13.910
 quad -core processor at 1.2 giga 

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:16.850
 hertz in this case we are talking about 

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:19.610
 qualcomm snapdragon 410 which is 64 

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:21.350
 bits though it's going to be more exploited 

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:22.880
 when lollipop and samsung are updated 

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:26.210
 He is already working on this update 

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:27.700
 this colleague of the adrenal gpu 306 like this 

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:30.740
 that together give a good performance 

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:31.910
 it has a gigabyte of ram memory and 

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:34.940
 with a storage memory 

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:36.770
 internal 16 gigabytes there you are seeing 

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:38.450
 some tests that I did as always 

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:40.580
 like to open several games be 

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:42.260
 switching between applications for 

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:44.360
 see more or less how many applications 

00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:46.490
 heavy or how many games can you open 

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:48.200
 simultaneously although I think this does not 

00:06:46.490 --> 00:06:50.510
 it's done so much in real life but it gives you 

00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:52.190
 an idea of how powerful is what 

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:54.770
 So good management has memory 

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:58.010
 ram so there I was opening several 

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:59.660
 games like minions roadshow handicrafts 

00:06:58.010 --> 00:07:01.910
 or several games that you are watching in 

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:03.620
 this moment and together has a good 

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:05.450
 performance maybe it's not the most 

00:07:03.620 --> 00:07:07.070
 remarkable but you're definitely not going to 

00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:09.230
 be suffering because this one 

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:11.270
 giving to each time or because you stay 

00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:13.340
 without memory because it has a good 

00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:15.680
 storage has enough memory 

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:17.990
 ram and a quad-core processor 

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:20.960
 64 bits plus that's enough 

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:22.790
 good to support this device well 

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:25.010
 that as you see there you have the 

00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:27.140
 features the details of the galaxy 

00:07:25.010 --> 00:07:30.910
 before I hope you liked this 

00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:30.910
 video and see you next
