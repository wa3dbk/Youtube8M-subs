to say I'm a big accomplished like fan

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.160 
to say I'm a big accomplished like fan
so<00:01:17.520> what<00:01:17.700> I<00:01:17.729> basically<00:01:17.970> done<00:01:18.330> is<00:01:18.360> a<00:01:18.539> slow<00:01:18.899> mode

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
so what I basically done is a slow mode

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:21.649 
so what I basically done is a slow mode
the<00:01:19.740> same<00:01:19.979> video<00:01:20.340> over<00:01:20.700> again<00:01:20.970> to<00:01:21.149> basic<00:01:21.479> give

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
the same video over again to basic give

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.270 
the same video over again to basic give
me<00:01:21.750> a<00:01:21.780> little<00:01:22.080> bit<00:01:22.259> more<00:01:22.500> time<00:01:22.710> to<00:01:22.740> talk<00:01:23.070> about

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
me a little bit more time to talk about

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.850 
me a little bit more time to talk about
it<00:01:23.630> because<00:01:24.630> it<00:01:24.720> was<00:01:24.840> so<00:01:25.080> short<00:01:25.350> from<00:01:25.740> the

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:25.860 
it because it was so short from the

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.919 
it because it was so short from the
beginning<00:01:26.369> and<00:01:26.399> it<00:01:26.940> should<00:01:27.360> also<00:01:27.539> give<00:01:27.810> you

00:01:27.919 --> 00:01:27.929 
beginning and it should also give you

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:29.809 
beginning and it should also give you
some<00:01:28.080> nice<00:01:28.259> slow<00:01:28.590> moments<00:01:29.280> I<00:01:29.369> don't<00:01:29.580> think<00:01:29.729> it

00:01:29.809 --> 00:01:29.819 
some nice slow moments I don't think it

00:01:29.819 --> 00:01:33.350 
some nice slow moments I don't think it
looks<00:01:30.060> too<00:01:30.300> bad<00:01:30.539> and<00:01:31.399> contract<00:01:32.399> as<00:01:32.610> extensive

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:33.360 
looks too bad and contract as extensive

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.529 
looks too bad and contract as extensive
in<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.600> video<00:01:33.899> has<00:01:34.080> sold<00:01:34.380> 25<00:01:35.250> million<00:01:36.149> copies

00:01:36.529 --> 00:01:36.539 
in the video has sold 25 million copies

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:39.529 
in the video has sold 25 million copies
and<00:01:36.929> I<00:01:37.440> mean<00:01:37.619> contract<00:01:38.190> was<00:01:38.340> so<00:01:38.789> popular<00:01:39.149> when

00:01:39.529 --> 00:01:39.539 
and I mean contract was so popular when

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:41.779 
and I mean contract was so popular when
I<00:01:39.569> was<00:01:39.810> a<00:01:39.840> kid<00:01:39.929> I<00:01:40.140> even<00:01:40.649> have<00:01:40.890> the<00:01:41.069> original

mob made by the players on half-life and

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.339 
mob made by the players on half-life and
that<00:01:53.250> was<00:01:53.429> basically<00:01:53.610> picked<00:01:54.119> up<00:01:54.330> by<00:01:54.840> valve

00:01:55.339 --> 00:01:55.349 
that was basically picked up by valve

00:01:55.349 --> 00:01:58.850 
that was basically picked up by valve
and<00:01:55.649> sold<00:01:56.250> there<00:01:56.700> as<00:01:57.090> a<00:01:57.149> real<00:01:57.569> game<00:01:57.869> and<00:01:58.170> it<00:01:58.590> is

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
no only a fast game that I think has

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.890 
no only a fast game that I think has
sold<00:02:04.140> more<00:02:04.410> copies<00:02:04.740> as<00:02:05.310> call<00:02:05.880> of<00:02:06.000> duty<00:02:06.390> the

sold more copies as call of duty the

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.260 
sold more copies as call of duty the
only<00:02:07.470> game<00:02:07.710> and<00:02:07.980> in<00:02:08.130> Sweden<00:02:08.640> you<00:02:09.119> were

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
considered a reject I really thought if

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.600 
considered a reject I really thought if
you<00:02:12.030> didn't<00:02:12.480> own<00:02:12.660> a<00:02:12.870> copy<00:02:13.170> on<00:02:13.560> counter<00:02:14.370> strike
