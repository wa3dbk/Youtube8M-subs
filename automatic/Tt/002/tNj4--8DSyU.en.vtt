00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:55.260
 thick limp that is large enough is ideal 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:58.079
 put a lid on it and let it go 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:01.079
 cook for another twenty minutes 

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:04.709

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.560
 completely out of there just neat to go in 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.030
