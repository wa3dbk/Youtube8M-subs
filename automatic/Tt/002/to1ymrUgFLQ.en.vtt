it to my processes he'd say yeah it's
broken<00:00:17.730> in<00:00:18.029> a<00:00:18.150> new<00:00:18.390> one<00:00:18.630> and<00:00:19.050> it's<00:00:19.289> true<00:00:19.439> I<00:00:19.500> do

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
broken in a new one and it's true I do

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.010 
broken in a new one and it's true I do
need<00:00:19.859> a<00:00:19.920> new<00:00:20.039> one<00:00:20.189> but<00:00:20.490> I<00:00:20.789> also<00:00:21.480> need<00:00:21.750> to<00:00:21.779> get

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
need a new one but I also need to get

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.170 
need a new one but I also need to get
around<00:00:22.260> for<00:00:22.710> the<00:00:23.070> next<00:00:23.340> little<00:00:23.490> while<00:00:23.580> until<00:00:24.119> I

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:24.180 
around for the next little while until I

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.259 
around for the next little while until I
can<00:00:24.330> get<00:00:24.449> that<00:00:24.660> new<00:00:24.900> one<00:00:25.109> and<00:00:25.890> I<00:00:25.980> also<00:00:26.269> wouldn't

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
can get that new one and I also wouldn't

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.810 
can get that new one and I also wouldn't
mind<00:00:27.800> running<00:00:28.800> this<00:00:29.070> thing<00:00:29.250> for<00:00:29.490> a<00:00:29.519> little<00:00:29.640> bit

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
mind running this thing for a little bit

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.930 
mind running this thing for a little bit
longer<00:00:30.060> until<00:00:30.240> it<00:00:30.570> actually<00:00:30.750> breaks<00:00:31.820> you<00:00:32.820> can

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
longer until it actually breaks you can

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.060 
longer until it actually breaks you can
see<00:00:33.120> that<00:00:33.329> you<00:00:33.899> probably<00:00:34.170> can't<00:00:34.410> but<00:00:34.680> take<00:00:34.890> my

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
see that you probably can't but take my

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.500 
see that you probably can't but take my
word<00:00:35.219> for<00:00:35.250> it<00:00:35.460> the<00:00:35.520> carbon<00:00:35.880> down<00:00:35.969> the<00:00:36.149> side<00:00:36.329> is

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
word for it the carbon down the side is

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.080 
word for it the carbon down the side is
all<00:00:36.660> cracked<00:00:36.989> and<00:00:38.360> there's<00:00:39.360> one<00:00:39.600> major<00:00:39.870> crack

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:41.090 
all cracked and there's one major crack

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:46.330 
all cracked and there's one major crack
on<00:00:42.090> the<00:00:43.040> right-hand<00:00:44.040> side<00:00:44.309> of<00:00:44.340> the<00:00:44.670> foot<00:00:45.180> so

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:46.340 
on the right-hand side of the foot so

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.119 
on the right-hand side of the foot so
what<00:00:47.340> I'm<00:00:47.430> gonna<00:00:47.520> do<00:00:47.730> is<00:00:48.390> my<00:00:48.570> goal<00:00:48.780> is<00:00:48.960> to<00:00:49.170> just

00:00:50.119 --> 00:00:50.129 
what I'm gonna do is my goal is to just

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:51.920 
what I'm gonna do is my goal is to just
cinch<00:00:50.789> everything<00:00:50.940> up<00:00:51.270> a<00:00:51.360> little<00:00:51.510> bit<00:00:51.629> tighter

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
cinch everything up a little bit tighter

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.369 
cinch everything up a little bit tighter
and<00:00:52.789> be<00:00:53.789> able<00:00:53.850> to<00:00:53.969> use<00:00:54.149> this<00:00:54.329> thing<00:00:54.570> and<00:00:55.079> the

00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
and be able to use this thing and the

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:04.130 
and be able to use this thing and the
method<00:00:55.789> is<00:00:57.680> duct<00:00:58.680> tape<00:01:02.719> first<00:01:03.719> thing<00:01:03.930> we<00:01:04.049> need

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
method is duct tape first thing we need

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.630 
method is duct tape first thing we need
to<00:01:04.170> prevent<00:01:05.040> is<00:01:06.380> that<00:01:07.380> heel<00:01:07.710> from<00:01:08.189> swinging

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
to prevent is that heel from swinging

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:18.640 
to prevent is that heel from swinging
out<00:01:08.760> like<00:01:09.000> that<00:01:12.140> so<00:01:14.030> we're<00:01:15.030> gonna<00:01:15.119> take<00:01:15.390> that

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:18.650 

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:20.660 

now<00:01:19.650> once<00:01:19.830> this<00:01:19.920> is<00:01:19.979> it<00:01:20.189> a<00:01:20.220> foot<00:01:20.460> she'll

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:20.670 
now once this is it a foot she'll

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:22.010 
now once this is it a foot she'll
probably<00:01:20.939> won't<00:01:21.210> swing<00:01:21.390> out<00:01:21.509> to<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:21.810> side

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
probably won't swing out to the side

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.320 
probably won't swing out to the side
anyway<00:01:22.350> but<00:01:22.650> you<00:01:23.280> don't<00:01:23.549> want<00:01:23.850> it<00:01:24.000> to<00:01:24.210> be

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:24.330 
anyway but you don't want it to be

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.770 
anyway but you don't want it to be
rattling<00:01:24.810> around<00:01:24.930> and<00:01:26.150> sounding<00:01:27.150> bad<00:01:27.330> and

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
rattling around and sounding bad and

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.390 
rattling around and sounding bad and
feeling<00:01:28.140> bad<00:01:28.369> and<00:01:29.369> causing<00:01:30.000> me<00:01:30.119> issues<00:01:30.479> so

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:31.400 
feeling bad and causing me issues so

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:35.600 
feeling bad and causing me issues so
then<00:01:32.400> get<00:01:32.610> that<00:01:32.790> all<00:01:32.909> taped<00:01:33.180> up<00:01:34.549> okay<00:01:35.549> so

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
then get that all taped up okay so

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:36.770 
then get that all taped up okay so
that's<00:01:35.880> pretty<00:01:35.970> good<00:01:36.240> that's<00:01:36.479> not<00:01:36.600> gonna

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:36.780 
that's pretty good that's not gonna

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.210 
that's pretty good that's not gonna
happen<00:01:37.020> anymore<00:01:37.409> that's<00:01:37.710> gonna<00:01:37.920> be<00:01:38.070> nice<00:01:38.189> and

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
happen anymore that's gonna be nice and

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.100 
happen anymore that's gonna be nice and
snug<00:01:38.520> now<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.540> next<00:01:39.780> thing<00:01:39.869> we're<00:01:40.020> gonna

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
snug now the next thing we're gonna

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:45.200 
snug now the next thing we're gonna
prevent<00:01:40.770> is<00:01:40.979> this<00:01:41.750> up<00:01:42.750> and<00:01:42.930> down<00:01:43.970> stuff<00:01:44.970> what's

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
prevent is this up and down stuff what's

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.789 
prevent is this up and down stuff what's
going<00:01:45.450> on<00:01:45.570> cuz<00:01:45.899> that's<00:01:46.079> not<00:01:46.290> any<00:01:46.470> good<00:01:46.619> either

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:46.799 
going on cuz that's not any good either

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:53.960 
going on cuz that's not any good either
so<00:01:47.329> my<00:01:48.329> plan<00:01:48.600> for<00:01:48.840> that<00:01:49.159> also<00:01:50.159> duct<00:01:50.820> tape

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:59.230 

this<00:01:54.450> time<00:01:56.960> we're<00:01:57.960> gonna<00:01:58.140> have<00:01:58.260> to<00:01:58.350> get<00:01:58.470> that

00:01:59.230 --> 00:01:59.240 
this time we're gonna have to get that

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.150 
this time we're gonna have to get that
right<00:02:00.240> in<00:02:00.420> here

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:01.160 
right in here

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.340 
right in here
into<00:02:02.160> the<00:02:02.280> spot<00:02:02.580> between<00:02:02.940> the<00:02:03.330> heel<00:02:03.600> carbon

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
into the spot between the heel carbon

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.510 
into the spot between the heel carbon
and<00:02:04.890> the<00:02:06.050> flipped<00:02:07.050> carbon<00:02:07.500> so<00:02:08.220> we're<00:02:08.310> going<00:02:08.430> to

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
and the flipped carbon so we're going to

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.249 
and the flipped carbon so we're going to
slide<00:02:08.729> it<00:02:08.759> in<00:02:09.030> the<00:02:09.240> best<00:02:09.420> we<00:02:09.570> can<00:02:09.750> I<00:02:09.810> bear<00:02:10.110> in

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
slide it in the best we can I bear in

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:20.080 
slide it in the best we can I bear in
mind<00:02:10.440> that<00:02:10.560> it's<00:02:10.770> sticky<00:02:17.750> just<00:02:18.750> like<00:02:19.050> that

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:20.090 
mind that it's sticky just like that

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:25.730 
mind that it's sticky just like that
wrap<00:02:21.090> it<00:02:21.300> over<00:02:24.230> I've<00:02:25.230> never<00:02:25.410> done<00:02:25.560> this<00:02:25.680> before

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
wrap it over I've never done this before

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:28.760 
wrap it over I've never done this before
and<00:02:26.310> then<00:02:26.550> freestyling<00:02:27.270> I<00:02:27.450> have<00:02:28.170> no<00:02:28.440> idea<00:02:28.709> if

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:28.770 
and then freestyling I have no idea if

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:30.560 
and then freestyling I have no idea if
this<00:02:28.890> is<00:02:28.950> gonna<00:02:29.130> work<00:02:29.220> or<00:02:29.520> not<00:02:29.610> but<00:02:29.880> it's

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
this is gonna work or not but it's

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:32.900 
this is gonna work or not but it's
better<00:02:30.750> to<00:02:30.900> try<00:02:31.140> and<00:02:31.170> fail<00:02:31.410> than<00:02:31.650> to<00:02:32.160> not<00:02:32.580> try

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
better to try and fail than to not try

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.250 
better to try and fail than to not try
it<00:02:32.940> at<00:02:33.060> all<00:02:34.160> and<00:02:35.160> this<00:02:36.120> so<00:02:36.300> far<00:02:36.570> so<00:02:36.810> good<00:02:36.840> this
