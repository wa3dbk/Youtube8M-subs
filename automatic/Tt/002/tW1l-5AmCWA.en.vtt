00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 hello to all and all these xz deco 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.220
 and welcome for this preview video 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.319
 spell of the monk who is the next 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:09.059
 hero appear on heroes of the storm 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.400
 and we start right away with radio 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.080
 dash who teleports quickly on a 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.670
 target allied to enemies in addition to the 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.109
 spell looks like he has several tanks 

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.900
 we see teleport once on 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:22.080
 vallat then on tic us for the second 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.880
 fate and well it's brice of heaven it's going 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.470
 treat so harasym which is the name of the 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.210
 monk and his close allies 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.279
 in addition to their maybe give them 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.240
 a speed movement but that's the speed 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:32.160
 of displacement it is perhaps a good 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.930
 talent is not really elected 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.670
 reach which is also a talent of 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.829
 diablo iii this is his third sister on 

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:39.750
 the e that seems to boost its dedicated in 

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:41.370
 melee and in addition to confer a 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.290
 ranged attack 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.670
 we are a little bit we do not really know 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.559
 the distance he shows us maybe not 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.670
 that it's bigger than that 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.399
 but in any case the scope of his self 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.320
 attack is improved after his first 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.180
 and ultimate so it's the seven strikes 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:56.699
 seven7 choices that you become so 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:58.500
 blah and in addition it's going to favor the 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.780
 hero and a half of course compared to the 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:03.719
 creep we see an improvement with a 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.670
 kind of mantra in the end protector his 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.770
 second ultimate is serenity 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.030
 you put a hero in a stasis whose 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.220
 you make him is invulnerable he can 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.549
 not move and after that you treat him 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:17.549
 enormously salary of an ultimate look 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.840
 but without the delay but launched 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:20.850
 against you have to immobilize your 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.200
 ally so that can cause concern by 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.119
 example sometimes the guys 

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:25.650
 if they have to teleport others by 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.000
 against the care bonus confer on the 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:29.250
 end looks rather huge 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.049

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:33.090
