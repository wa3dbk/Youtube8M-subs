00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
they're really good we go to war and we

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:55.910 
they're really good we go to war and we
even<00:00:54.690> look<00:00:54.929> at<00:00:55.050> their<00:00:55.170> war<00:00:55.350> stats<00:00:55.679> they're

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:55.920 
even look at their war stats they're

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.489 
even look at their war stats they're
really<00:00:56.160> good<00:00:56.629> but<00:00:57.629> for<00:00:57.870> some<00:00:58.050> reason<00:00:58.379> they

00:00:58.489 --> 00:00:58.499 
really good but for some reason they

00:00:58.499 --> 00:01:00.349 
really good but for some reason they
attack<00:00:58.890> the<00:00:59.129> lower<00:00:59.309> players<00:00:59.760> and<00:01:00.120> its<00:01:00.239> really

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359 
attack the lower players and its really

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.779 
attack the lower players and its really
annoying<00:01:00.570> and<00:01:00.870> some<00:01:01.199> people<00:01:01.530> actually<00:01:02.460> are

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
annoying and some people actually are

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.509 
annoying and some people actually are
really<00:01:03.179> bad<00:01:03.329> at<00:01:03.510> attacking<00:01:03.899> so<00:01:04.830> we<00:01:05.309> think

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
really bad at attacking so we think

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:06.560 
really bad at attacking so we think
they're<00:01:05.670> really<00:01:05.880> good<00:01:06.030> at<00:01:06.120> the<00:01:06.210> start<00:01:06.510> but

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
they're really good at the start but

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.960 
they're really good at the start but
then<00:01:06.930> we<00:01:07.080> realized<00:01:07.290> that<00:01:07.830> they<00:01:08.730> don't<00:01:08.910> know

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:08.970 
then we realized that they don't know

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.910 
then we realized that they don't know
