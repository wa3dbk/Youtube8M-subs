00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:09.230
 hello and welcome here 

00:00:06.589 --> 00:00:10.520
 barlow with a little addon guide and 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:13.900
 really a little parent this time 

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:17.060
 guide because i have in some videos 

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:18.470
 some of the addons are not presented 

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:19.550
 Idea what an hour explanation needs 

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:21.560
 and I at least an hour 

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.609
 I have used explanation 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.859
 now a few and sometimes 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:26.210
 In between, imagine the rather tiny 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:29.179
 are and maybe just one 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:31.970
 only thing but make the 

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:33.410
 either have some usefulness 

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.120
 one thinks of or of me 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.880
 At least I thought so, too 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.890
 thank god is something or I 

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.450
 say cosmetic nature that is 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.070
 First what I imagine for everyone 

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:44.930
 wanna call herself monster around her 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.220
 knows the situation you cast something 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.140
 and if now up in the middle of the 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:50.990
 screen looks here 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:53.990
 then you see a spam from arrow 

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:56.690
 messages and finds so I think 

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:57.980
 at least not very nice and there 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.050
 there is workaround an add on called 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.230
 airdrop monster and if i'm in here 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:04.730
 had interface addons ever 

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:08.290
 I can install a frame 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:11.540
 choose in which the error message 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:13.130
 to be displayed and the woman 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.870
 that's why the blizzard arrow frame was that 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.850
 who could see it up again and 

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:18.830
 I do it mostly so that I can do it 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:21.680
 just pack in the channel and then 

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:23.750
 can you down here is my chat can 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:27.560
 You see the message when I am 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:30.409
 here and there a button at the top of the 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.900
 has disappeared in the middle and bottom left 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:35.270
 once youth is debated 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:37.280
 and an action is in progress 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.110
 usually if I have situations now 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.780
 I have the buttons 150 times in 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.340
 follow spam will me this error message 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.970
 the special error message always stops 

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:49.940
 once shown exactly that was it 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.470
 I hope you will benefit for 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:53.600
 If not, find this add-on 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:55.340
 is hope you like it and 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.229
 if so, I would be glad if you 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.360
 subscribed to our channel i will be in 

00:01:57.229 --> 00:02:00.979
 the next days and weeks always 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.270
 again smaller ones and maybe also 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:03.140
 one or two bigger parents 

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.710
 introduce again 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.710
 until then
