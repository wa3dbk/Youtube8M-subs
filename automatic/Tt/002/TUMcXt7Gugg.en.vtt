is<00:01:55.950> pretty<00:01:56.250> much<00:01:56.399> the<00:01:56.899> destinations<00:01:58.189> um<00:01:59.630> the

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
is pretty much the destinations um the

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:03.050 
is pretty much the destinations um the
idea<00:02:00.930> of<00:02:01.079> the<00:02:01.140> destinations<00:02:01.710> that<00:02:02.040> it<00:02:02.820> all

the<00:02:50.300> back<00:02:51.250> follow<00:02:52.250> the<00:02:52.640> inner<00:02:52.970> workings<00:02:54.580> the

00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:55.580 
the back follow the inner workings the

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.750 
the back follow the inner workings the
basic<00:02:56.000> dispenser<00:02:57.220> loading<00:02:58.220> and<00:02:58.460> all<00:02:58.580> that

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:58.760 
basic dispenser loading and all that

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:03.040 
basic dispenser loading and all that
stuff<00:02:59.030> that<00:02:59.960> main<00:03:00.230> system<00:03:01.060> itself<00:03:02.060> em<00:03:02.360> I've

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.050 
stuff that main system itself em I've

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:06.340 
stuff that main system itself em I've
compact<00:03:03.800> it<00:03:03.920> down<00:03:04.070> quite<00:03:04.430> a<00:03:04.460> bit<00:03:04.550> on<00:03:05.200> making<00:03:06.200> it

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:06.350 
compact it down quite a bit on making it

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:11.470 
compact it down quite a bit on making it
only<00:03:06.560> one<00:03:07.130> wider<00:03:07.400> in<00:03:07.670> the<00:03:08.420> back<00:03:09.970> but<00:03:10.970> once<00:03:11.180> we

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
only one wider in the back but once we

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.950 
only one wider in the back but once we
add<00:03:11.630> on<00:03:11.840> our<00:03:12.670> entire<00:03:13.670> destination<00:03:14.420> selection

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:14.960 
add on our entire destination selection

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:18.850 
add on our entire destination selection
and<00:03:15.400> all<00:03:16.400> that<00:03:16.610> that's<00:03:17.240> when<00:03:17.570> things<00:03:17.720> get<00:03:18.170> a<00:03:18.470> a

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:18.860 
and all that that's when things get a a

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:22.600 
and all that that's when things get a a
little<00:03:19.640> bit<00:03:19.730> bigger<00:03:19.970> I<00:03:21.340> guess<00:03:22.340> it<00:03:22.490> was<00:03:22.580> a

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:22.610 
little bit bigger I guess it was a

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:26.830 
little bit bigger I guess it was a
little<00:03:22.760> unavoidable<00:03:23.450> to<00:03:24.790> to<00:03:25.790> keep<00:03:26.030> this<00:03:26.630> as

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
little unavoidable to to keep this as

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:32.890 
little unavoidable to to keep this as
small<00:03:27.230> or<00:03:27.880> smaller<00:03:28.880> than<00:03:31.360> then<00:03:32.360> I<00:03:32.390> thought<00:03:32.870> I

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
small or smaller than then I thought I

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:38.530 
small or smaller than then I thought I
could<00:03:36.100> but<00:03:37.100> I'm<00:03:37.250> very<00:03:37.430> pleased<00:03:37.790> this<00:03:38.150> should

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:38.540 
could but I'm very pleased this should

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:40.750 
could but I'm very pleased this should
be<00:03:38.570> the<00:03:38.780> most<00:03:38.930> compact<00:03:39.440> way<00:03:39.800> of<00:03:40.370> having

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:40.760 
be the most compact way of having

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:43.540 
be the most compact way of having
destination<00:03:41.330> selection<00:03:41.780> I've<00:03:42.050> gone<00:03:42.980> for<00:03:43.370> deep

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:43.550 
destination selection I've gone for deep

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:46.900 
destination selection I've gone for deep
with<00:03:43.970> some<00:03:44.390> very<00:03:44.900> basic<00:03:45.140> wiring<00:03:45.590> I'm<00:03:46.010> also

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:46.910 
with some very basic wiring I'm also

repeaters you've got some of them are

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:53.560 
repeaters you've got some of them are
too<00:03:51.440> long<00:03:51.650> leading<00:03:52.580> to<00:03:52.880> our<00:03:53.060> actual

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:07.280 
go about three deep um for our MTG

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:11.350 
go about three deep um for our MTG
architecture<00:04:09.010> all<00:04:10.010> in<00:04:10.190> all<00:04:10.310> I'm<00:04:10.550> pretty<00:04:10.610> darn

um<00:04:21.890> if<00:04:22.890> you<00:04:23.490> don't<00:04:23.520> think<00:04:23.940> this<00:04:24.480> is<00:04:24.540> a<00:04:24.750> really

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110 
um if you don't think this is a really

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:27.530 
um if you don't think this is a really
small<00:04:25.410> minecart<00:04:25.860> station<00:04:26.340> or<00:04:26.610> it<00:04:27.330> could<00:04:27.510> be

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.540 
small minecart station or it could be

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:30.650 
small minecart station or it could be
smaller<00:04:27.870> you<00:04:28.650> know<00:04:28.770> let<00:04:28.980> me<00:04:29.010> know<00:04:29.180> so<00:04:30.180> I<00:04:30.210> can

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:30.660 
smaller you know let me know so I can

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:32.000 
smaller you know let me know so I can
incorporate<00:04:31.020> or<00:04:31.380> figure<00:04:31.650> out<00:04:31.770> a<00:04:31.800> way<00:04:31.890> to<00:04:31.950> make

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.010 
incorporate or figure out a way to make

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:36.230 
incorporate or figure out a way to make
it<00:04:32.160> even<00:04:32.310> small<00:04:32.640> so<00:04:33.540> that<00:04:34.040> we<00:04:35.040> can<00:04:35.250> all<00:04:35.370> enjoy

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
it even small so that we can all enjoy

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:41.240 
it even small so that we can all enjoy
this<00:04:36.540> design<00:04:37.580> so<00:04:38.580> that's<00:04:38.730> about<00:04:38.940> it<00:04:38.970> and<00:04:40.250> ty

00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:41.250 
this design so that's about it and ty

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:44.030 
this design so that's about it and ty
