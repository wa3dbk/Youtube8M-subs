00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:05.290
 hi guys, how good is that 

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:07.000
 regular 3 

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:10.160
 I'm not well 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.600
 just warn that this is not 

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.869
 a normal gameplay I will not teach 

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:16.849
 absolutely nothing simply a piece 

00:00:14.869 --> 00:00:19.190
 good a piece the starting piece that 

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:21.170
 they let me play 

00:00:19.190 --> 00:00:23.690
 I was here taxing games with 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:25.430
 vehicles because some friends I 

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:27.110
 had asked to be parted with 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:28.880
 vehicles and good was recording and of 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:31.160
 this happened to me that has been happening to me 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:34.010
 often and I do not know if the correct word 

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:35.510
 would denounce it but at least if 

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.670
 complain about the situation that they are 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:39.370
 finding the rental servers and 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:42.579
 is the fact that 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:45.129
 people who rent servers under the 

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:46.550
 conditions or privileges have them 

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:48.649
 the pay 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.410
 can create public or 

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:55.030
 equalized 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:57.090
 that they are not because they score they are worth 

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:00.920
 scoring games that 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:04.939
 that as the word punctual says 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:06.530
 and the administrator his fucking mother have 

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:09.470
 the privileges of expelling from the 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:11.180
 game you are playing a server 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.159
 rent and if you're playing the 

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:14.780
 administrator and he kills the fish and he 

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:17.119
 Your cock inflates will bring you departure 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.940
 it's even that it does not seem like me 

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:21.160
 normal 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:22.300
 I do not say it 's better or worse or that 

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:24.850
 Play better or worse than anyone 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.440
 I simply say that here you must kill 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:27.820
 who is not weak and what should I do 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.160
 quite often you should have luck 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:32.120
 of the orgy because I was expelling a 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:34.590
 starting egg 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:37.679
 and I'm pretty fed up 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.929
 that by entering a game and having 

00:01:37.679 --> 00:01:41.759
 here the 100 that I repeat I'm not 

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:44.159
 boasting that having 100 eagle from 

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:46.610
 shit eagle but simply that the 

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:49.220
 people of the rank 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:51.290
 and it expels you is that it is the host 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.180
 it seems the host looks at the privileges of 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:55.040
 have science here you have the 

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:56.690
 science how good you are take the whore 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.930
 street is that I do not seem or half 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:01.130
 normal or average normal I think 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:02.900
 imagine that a fucking team is 

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:04.670
 playing at home is not like your house 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:06.229
 comes the real madrid says he has put 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:08.479
 they did ronaldo today I do not play not me 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:09.950
 salami of the cock di Maria to take by 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:11.570
 ass if you take it for ass 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.520
 saviano is taking for ass but trunk 

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:14.990
 what are we talking about 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.090
 what way to condition a game 

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:19.190
 public accepts every time it does not seem 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.740
 normal just does not seem normal 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:24.600
 I do not think I do not think that in 

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:27.860
 Items under these conditions 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:29.690
 it can be scored 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.550
 if you want to make a private party 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:35.570
 great if you want to make a game 

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:38.090
 public not ranked that does not score me 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:40.190
 it seems totally perfect that you can 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.540
 eject or let's call it manage that 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:45.920
 sounds softer we do not speak better 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:47.420
 We must manage the issue of deciding 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.380
 who do you want me to play in that game 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.060
 If you think someone 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:52.530
 because you are not doing the right thing or 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.380
 you want to throw someone because you're 

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:56.700
 inflates that because it seems great 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:57.960
 that if you have paid have the 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.610
 privileges of being this person 

00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:03.120
 I hope you can make a game 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:04.920
 public scoring no matter how much you 

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:06.810
 paid out 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.810
 because you can expel people I had a 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:11.400
 puntuable and I think that we go 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:13.170
 scandal 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.990
 you are totally conditioning the 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:18.260
 departure 

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:20.330
 I personally do not care about the subject 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.820
 of statistics the subject of the 

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:25.040
 proportion the subject of a mother gives me 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:26.840
 same all this I simply say here 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.810
 As you can see, they expel me from thinking that 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:31.340
 there was a line error or something but 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:33.140
 well when I went out I found myself 

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.270
 the good little cry I say I do not care 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:36.740
 statistics I just want out 

00:03:35.270 --> 00:03:38.690
 subscribed thinking that the scoring 

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:39.500
 they are the place to play at ease but it 

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:42.110
 see that no 

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:45.050
 Well, guys, here I leave it up to you. 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:48.010
 what do you think about it and see you soon 

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:48.010
 see you later
