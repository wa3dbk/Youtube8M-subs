00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
and they're interested in identifying

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.200 
and they're interested in identifying
plants<00:00:37.380> okay<00:00:37.950> and<00:00:38.190> sometimes<00:00:38.940> they<00:00:39.090> have<00:00:39.180> a

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
plants okay and sometimes they have a

plants okay and sometimes they have a
book<00:00:39.510> with<00:00:39.690> them<00:00:39.809> they<00:00:39.960> can't<00:00:40.170> find<00:00:40.440> it<00:00:40.590> in<00:00:40.710> the

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
book with them they can't find it in the

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.430 
book with them they can't find it in the
book<00:00:41.090> so<00:00:42.090> what<00:00:42.239> you<00:00:42.329> do<00:00:42.510> is<00:00:42.540> you<00:00:42.719> take<00:00:42.750> a<00:00:42.930> sample

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
book so what you do is you take a sample

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:46.790 
book so what you do is you take a sample
of<00:00:43.530> the<00:00:43.590> plant<00:00:43.950> and<00:00:44.899> the<00:00:45.899> plant<00:00:45.930> press<00:00:46.530> will

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
of the plant and the plant press will

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.139 
of the plant and the plant press will
preserve<00:00:47.520> that<00:00:48.030> plant<00:00:48.420> for<00:00:48.750> you<00:00:48.930> for<00:00:49.649> instance

00:00:50.139 --> 00:00:50.149 
preserve that plant for you for instance

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:54.619 
preserve that plant for you for instance
here's<00:00:51.149> the<00:00:51.300> plant<00:00:51.600> Toyota<00:00:52.469> Toya<00:00:53.449> all<00:00:54.449> right

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
here's the plant Toyota Toya all right

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.840

would take this and you would put it in

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.490 
would take this and you would put it in
this<00:00:58.289> plant<00:00:58.590> for<00:00:58.649> us<00:00:58.829> this<00:00:59.039> plant<00:00:59.370> press<00:00:59.670> is

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:00.500 
this plant for us this plant press is

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.070 
this plant for us this plant press is
the<00:01:02.090> specimens<00:01:03.090> in<00:01:03.210> here<00:01:03.420> are<00:01:03.539> about<00:01:03.629> 10<00:01:03.960> years

help preserve this is there something in

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.200 
help preserve this is there something in
the<00:01:36.600> paper<00:01:36.810> it<00:01:37.710> helps<00:01:38.070> absorb<00:01:38.220> the<00:01:38.759> juices

the paper it helps absorb the juices
from<00:01:39.360> the<00:01:39.420> plants<00:01:39.930> so<00:01:40.409> it<00:01:40.500> doesn't<00:01:40.770> go<00:01:40.920> through

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
from the plants so it doesn't go through

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.730 
from the plants so it doesn't go through
and<00:01:41.310> stay<00:01:41.549> anything<00:01:42.060> and<00:01:42.270> it<00:01:43.049> holds<00:01:43.320> the<00:01:43.560> whole

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
and stay anything and it holds the whole

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.790 
and stay anything and it holds the whole
thing<00:01:43.979> together<00:01:44.159> this<00:01:44.939> is<00:01:45.119> glo

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:45.800 
thing together this is glo

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.190 
thing together this is glo
all<00:01:46.700> right<00:01:46.880> I<00:01:47.060> wasn't<00:01:47.270> sure<00:01:47.570> what<00:01:47.750> this<00:01:47.930> was

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200
