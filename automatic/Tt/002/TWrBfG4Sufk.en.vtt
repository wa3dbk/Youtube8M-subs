we'll start with the offense he's got a
great<00:00:19.470> speed<00:00:19.949> of<00:00:20.189> 10<00:00:21.980> so<00:00:22.980> he<00:00:23.189> can<00:00:23.369> get<00:00:23.550> very

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:23.730 
great speed of 10 so he can get very

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.470 
great speed of 10 so he can get very
close<00:00:24.029> to<00:00:24.300> enemies<00:00:24.689> very<00:00:24.960> quickly<00:00:25.609> then<00:00:26.609> it

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:27.480 
close to enemies very quickly then it

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:29.630 
close to enemies very quickly then it
grabbed<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:28.080> little<00:00:28.349> extension<00:00:28.949> part<00:00:29.429> of<00:00:29.519> his

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640

grabbed the little extension part of his
shoulder<00:00:30.090> and<00:00:30.539> you<00:00:30.660> spin<00:00:31.019> it<00:00:31.579> he<00:00:32.579> doesn't<00:00:32.910> have

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:33.030 
shoulder and you spin it he doesn't have

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:35.209 
shoulder and you spin it he doesn't have
a<00:00:33.090> spring<00:00:33.510> which<00:00:34.200> means<00:00:34.500> all<00:00:34.680> this<00:00:34.920> strength

00:00:35.209 --> 00:00:35.219 
a spring which means all this strength

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.819 
a spring which means all this strength
report<00:00:35.670> is<00:00:35.820> in<00:00:36.120> how<00:00:36.719> fast<00:00:37.079> you<00:00:37.260> can<00:00:37.320> spin<00:00:37.710> his

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
report is in how fast you can spin his

report is in how fast you can spin his
arm<00:00:39.230> this<00:00:40.230> actually<00:00:40.890> is<00:00:40.980> very<00:00:41.040> effective<00:00:42.410> just

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
arm this actually is very effective just

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.520 
arm this actually is very effective just
line<00:00:43.710> them<00:00:43.890> up<00:00:44.040> and<00:00:45.000> watch<00:00:45.840> him<00:00:46.079> knock<00:00:46.350> him

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
line them up and watch him knock him

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:54.020 
line them up and watch him knock him
down<00:00:51.410> this<00:00:52.410> may<00:00:52.680> seem<00:00:52.739> kind<00:00:53.280> of<00:00:53.399> cheap<00:00:53.670> since

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:54.030 
down this may seem kind of cheap since

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:56.720 
down this may seem kind of cheap since
it's<00:00:54.180> like<00:00:54.329> an<00:00:54.449> instant<00:00:54.899> death<00:00:55.170> and<00:00:55.739> there's

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
it's like an instant death and there's

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.450 
it's like an instant death and there's
really<00:00:57.090> high<00:00:57.300> speed<00:00:57.770> makes<00:00:58.770> him<00:00:58.920> extremely

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
really high speed makes him extremely

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.799 
really high speed makes him extremely
tricky<00:00:59.940> to<00:01:00.180> avoid<00:01:02.149> but<00:01:03.149> if<00:01:03.300> that<00:01:03.480> wasn't

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
tricky to avoid but if that wasn't

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:16.280 
tricky to avoid but if that wasn't
enough<00:01:03.870> watch<00:01:04.320> his<00:01:04.530> defense<00:01:14.689> it's<00:01:15.689> because<00:01:16.140> of

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
enough watch his defense it's because of

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.990 
enough watch his defense it's because of
his<00:01:16.409> stance<00:01:17.930> his<00:01:18.930> legs<00:01:19.259> go<00:01:19.530> backward<00:01:20.040> but<00:01:20.820> his

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
his stance his legs go backward but his

his stance his legs go backward but his
body<00:01:21.270> goes<00:01:21.600> forward<00:01:22.490> his<00:01:23.490> only<00:01:24.119> weakness<00:01:24.330> is

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
body goes forward his only weakness is

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.910 
body goes forward his only weakness is
that<00:01:25.890> little<00:01:26.640> thing<00:01:26.880> above<00:01:27.210> his<00:01:27.360> head<00:01:27.650> if<00:01:28.650> you

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
that little thing above his head if you

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.109 
that little thing above his head if you
hit<00:01:29.159> it<00:01:29.420> he<00:01:30.420> falls<00:01:30.810> back<00:01:31.049> pretty<00:01:31.350> easily<00:01:31.619> but

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:32.119 
hit it he falls back pretty easily but

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:37.010 
hit it he falls back pretty easily but
it's<00:01:33.119> a<00:01:33.360> small<00:01:33.570> target<00:01:35.090> his<00:01:36.090> only<00:01:36.360> downside<00:01:36.990> is
