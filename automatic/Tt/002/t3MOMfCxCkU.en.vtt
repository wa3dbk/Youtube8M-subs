00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 women of all walton so this case does not 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:04.950
 daily video and it's here as I am 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:06.870
 watching in a placo gameplay these 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.490
 I'm on the hot semi-point map 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.260
 and we are in this case with the 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:11.429
 scale check stage seeing the truth is 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.889
 that has never brought a gameplay of the 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:15.809
 deficiencies of the channel and why not 

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.119
 I had used practically nothing and 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:20.310
 as it was in the secondary account yesterday 

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.320
 being I have prestige and could not for 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.240
 so to say unlock more weapons and for 

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.830
 that of the chips I do not know if they are tokens 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.570
 unlocking chips as you want them 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:28.920
 call not because it supports unlock and good 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.390
 like lately I'm playing more in the 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:32.340
 main account and there I already have 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.230
 prestige teacher and to use all 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.760
 the weapons well I'm going to use it is 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.380
 karachi and the truth is that at the beginning 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.710
 that has begun to use with jigsaw 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.700
 wide the quick charger forgiveness and with 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.649
 unsheathed was going quite well and I 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.020
 I was one of the nuclear and good and 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:47.579
 I was a tad tired of trying and 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.050
 Do not take me out and in the end I'll finish 

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.850
 putting the muffler the discharge of 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.100
 fast and good in the end finished 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.140
 falling the nuclear in this map the map 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.699
 of mails and good as commented base 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.870
 before then I was playing just because 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.130
 well I was a tad tired already of 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.960
 play with equipment because 

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:03.490
 Well yes, it 's true that I always 

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.989
 I said that but you can spend a lot 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:07.090
 better because they take you apart too 

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:08.830
 clouds like this is today you can be a tad more 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:10.900
 easy and that but one I ended up tired 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:13.480
 because they kept stole from me wolves 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:15.190
 enemies and I said good I mess with with 

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:17.020
 people there random with people who do not 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:18.610
 I know nothing when alone and that and 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.310
 good and willy - nilly well maybe 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:23.260
 you can have a better time later 

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.150
 inflate a little more and good attentive this 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.650
 moment that starts to shoot at this 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:28.240
 boy and you know that I do not land 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:30.280
 take hardness and it 's the moment when 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:32.020
 they leave you to a bullet what good if 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.160
 carried hardness to the best if it had 

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:35.800
 followed fired from would have killed 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:37.540
 we have that says come in to separate me already 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:39.970
 I recommend you always be like that 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:41.920
 pretty red then you leave or whatever 

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:44.229
 good that you have to shoot because if 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.880
 they love us killing and good attentive 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:47.350
 this moment is trick critical moment in 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.479
 which video you start to see the 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:51.490
 enemies and leaving kill and I but of 

00:01:49.479 --> 00:01:53.530
 What do you study what happens to 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:55.630
 see another enemy and about killing me water 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.700
 me ok uat my case is that you are now 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.960
 watching now they are going to throw me a c4 and 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:01.210
 thank goodness he wore the vest 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:03.430
 bulletproof or this game already leave me 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.410
 red not the following is amazing and 

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:06.400
 good as always was not anymore 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:09.759
 those bulletproof vest 

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:12.100
 lasts the scavenger and the tactical mask 

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:14.980
 it's what works best for me 

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:17.050
 usually convinces and well I'm not 46 me 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.660
 it seems with some other low but the 

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:20.740
 Most casualties are with the weapon 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.540
 as you are seeing I am using the 

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:24.280
 camouflage ghosts that you already know that good 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.630
 I think yes in reservations the 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.840
 next call of duty if only then what 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:31.540
 you could unlock and well you know that 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.550
 I some time ago I went up with a 

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:36.100
 click if what you could buy 

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:37.930
 free and it was there when I took it and 

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.610
 good to make this video fell to me 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.350
 final a strike and well that's why I can not 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.060
 make it effective and nothing the truth is that 

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:44.470
 It bothered me a little bit because good 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:46.660
 I understand why I ended up putting a 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.910
 strike for that video because I do not know if 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:50.620
 I said spamina things I know what moves 

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:52.060
 more so well I can not make you from 

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:54.100
 streaming but I told you that I'm going 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:56.320
 to promise to bring you something like 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:58.810
 record an hour and a half live or 

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:01.090
 something like that and then put it together and do as 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.400
 if it was a streaming but delayed and 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.470
 If I get water, they can plan a double 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.030
 a triple move or something like that and 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:08.350
 you know how good it is I will try to get 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.340
 at best with the description for 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:11.140
 people who do not want to work 

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:13.030
 whole the moments in which it is 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:15.069
 that game or that 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:17.110
 that hand that play for you to see 

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:18.790
 perfectly so good camouflage 

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:20.200
 I do not know exactly how 

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:22.120
 you can acquire now it seems to me that 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.069
 reserving the game the next one 

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.709
 new expensive beauty as you can villar 

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:28.390
 but we go in any case by bridges 

00:03:26.709 --> 00:03:30.310
 and that seems to me that they already patched it like this 

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:32.020
 that you can not acquire it and it's good 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.430
 pretty good he 's pretty handsome and I 

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:34.989
 it seems to me that I only have it in this 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.630
 green bill that you just unlock it 

00:03:34.989 --> 00:03:39.819
 one account and not all but I'll try 

00:03:37.630 --> 00:03:41.650
 also get me good since I 'm in 

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:43.209
 this account and in this account I have 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:44.950
 all weapons and I can get all of them 

00:03:43.209 --> 00:03:46.450
 the diamonds then I will try to get myself out 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:48.670
 before it's good that it comes out 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:50.320
 next Carlos and all the weapons of 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:51.640
 diamond and still bring you a video so that 

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:53.470
 you see it, although I'm sure that 

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:55.000
 people have it out there so good 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:57.489
 you are seeing that I already had only one 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:59.290
 for good so to nuclear I do not 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:04:01.060
 there were two with this I stayed and only 

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:02.739
 one was a little nervous because as 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.810
 is now yes watching I was surrounded 

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:07.630
 totally of all the enemies there in 

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:09.310
 that little house they were for the four 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:11.140
 sides basically and well I already 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:13.480
 I was nervous I had one because 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:14.769
 I was tired and I told you about good 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:17.350
 that the previous game had 

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:19.120
 killed one of the nuclear so good 

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:21.310
 right here you have the nuclear 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.750
 killing because I said good let's stay 

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:24.970
 four minutes could better have 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:28.090
 tried then good the double but 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:29.710
 I was rather a little behind a bit 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:31.930
 slow because as you have seen it is 

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:34.000
 nor is it very fast and 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:35.860
 it's because I do not know how to play 

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.870
 hot spot and on this map other than 

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:39.970
 they begin to change the two points of a 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:41.800
 side by side because it makes it slower 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:43.840
 but in any case they said let's 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.669
 try to take out some unstoppable me 

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:47.889
 got a run of 35 so 

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:49.360
 five hits I'll kill between 

00:04:47.889 --> 00:04:50.770
 nothing last said what I hope you 

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:52.600
 I liked most of all is the video already 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:54.639
 you know what motivates a lot and commented 

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:56.680
 what good others seem to do 

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:58.930
 a streaming in deferred plan if it 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:00.550
 you will see and all that so nothing and I've already 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:02.350
 said vote the video I leave the 

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:05.160
 final results and all that would be 

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:05.160
 many like to see it 

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:08.250
 bye
