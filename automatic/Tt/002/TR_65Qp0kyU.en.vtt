00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.763
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:09.760
We like to blame our
skin for a lot of things,

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:11.635
but it's time to let it off the hook.

00:00:11.635 --> 00:00:14.820
It's called razor burn for
a reason, and chances are

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:16.804
your skin's not to blame for this one.

00:00:16.804 --> 00:00:20.690
It could be your razor.

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:23.610
Women generally recognize
razor burn as a rash that

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:25.480
appears shortly after shaving.

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:28.560
It's red and sometimes itchy or painful.

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.200
Environmental factors
certainly contribute.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:35.320
For example, if your skin is exposed to
irritating chemicals such as chlorine

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:38.550
in pools, or products
with heavy fragrances,

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.140
as well as extreme heat
and cold, you're more

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.910
likely to experience skin irritation
and potentially razor burn.

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.780
But razor burn can be the result of two
things-- bad shaving habits and lack

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:50.280
of moisture.

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:57.830
Using shave gel creates a protective
layer between the blades and your skin.

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:01.840
Gillette's Satin Care Ultra
Sensitive is dye- and fragrance-free,

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.670
which can further help avoid irritation.

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:06.770
When you shave with a dull
razor, you'll typically

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.130
press harder or shave over
the same area multiple times

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:11.830
in order to get a close shave.

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:14.100
Switching to a new
razor with more blades

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.850
can help capture more
hairs on the first stroke.

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.390
The Venus Embrace
Sensitive razor has give

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:21.970
blades that are spaced closer together.

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:24.560
This makes it less likely
for the skin to bulge up

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.830
between the blades, which can
increase the potential for irritation

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:29.190
from shaving.

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:33.060
To relieve skin irritation, I
recommended a mild hydrocortizone

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:33.880
cream.

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.170
Also, products with aloe
can help soothe the skin.

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.500
I always tell my patients, keeping
your skin well-hydrated and exfoliated,

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.450
as well as replacing blades
at the first sign of dullness,

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.150
can help prevent razor
burn in the future.

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:49.080
Because your skin is
naturally beautiful,

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.140
your shouldn't be afraid to show it off.

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:56.190
You can find a perfect match for you and
your skin with Venus Embrace Sensitive

00:01:56.190 --> 00:01:58.930
by just changing your razor.
