00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:02.180 

all<00:00:01.079> right<00:00:01.260> in<00:00:01.469> this<00:00:01.650> video<00:00:01.890> we're<00:00:02.040> going<00:00:02.129> to

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:02.190 
all right in this video we're going to

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:03.919 
all right in this video we're going to
look<00:00:02.310> at<00:00:02.460> a<00:00:02.490> little<00:00:02.700> related<00:00:03.179> rates<00:00:03.389> problem

00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:03.929 
look at a little related rates problem

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:06.530 
look at a little related rates problem
so<00:00:04.170> suppose<00:00:05.040> a<00:00:05.069> pebble<00:00:05.580> is<00:00:05.790> dropped<00:00:06.210> into<00:00:06.420> a

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
so suppose a pebble is dropped into a

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.390 
so suppose a pebble is dropped into a
pool<00:00:06.810> of<00:00:06.870> water<00:00:07.020> and<00:00:07.500> that<00:00:08.010> makes<00:00:08.189> little

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
pool of water and that makes little

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.820 
pool of water and that makes little
circular<00:00:08.670> ripples<00:00:09.240> the<00:00:09.960> radius<00:00:10.410> of<00:00:10.679> the

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:10.830 
circular ripples the radius of the

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.799 
circular ripples the radius of the
largest<00:00:11.130> ripples<00:00:11.670> increasing<00:00:12.269> at<00:00:12.360> a<00:00:12.389> constant

00:00:12.799 --> 00:00:12.809 
largest ripples increasing at a constant

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:15.799 
largest ripples increasing at a constant
rate<00:00:13.019> of<00:00:13.469> 6<00:00:13.920> inches<00:00:14.190> per<00:00:14.400> second<00:00:14.820> we<00:00:15.509> want<00:00:15.719> to

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
rate of 6 inches per second we want to

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:17.090 
rate of 6 inches per second we want to
know<00:00:15.900> what's<00:00:16.139> the<00:00:16.320> increase<00:00:16.770> in<00:00:17.010> the

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:17.100 
know what's the increase in the

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.609 
know what's the increase in the
circumference<00:00:17.760> of<00:00:18.119> the<00:00:18.390> ripple<00:00:18.750> after<00:00:19.289> 3

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:19.619 
circumference of the ripple after 3

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.990 
circumference of the ripple after 3
seconds<00:00:20.039> have<00:00:20.310> passed

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:23.000 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.240 

ok<00:00:24.000> so<00:00:24.269> when<00:00:25.260> I<00:00:25.289> do<00:00:25.380> these<00:00:25.650> problems<00:00:28.039> so<00:00:29.039> little

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
ok so when I do these problems so little

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.640 
ok so when I do these problems so little
acronym<00:00:29.789> I<00:00:30.119> typically<00:00:30.480> like<00:00:30.750> to<00:00:30.960> use<00:00:31.199> when<00:00:31.619> I

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650 
acronym I typically like to use when I

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.850 
acronym I typically like to use when I
do<00:00:31.740> these<00:00:31.980> problems<00:00:32.510> and<00:00:33.510> you<00:00:34.260> know<00:00:34.380> this<00:00:34.590> ones

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
do these problems and you know this ones

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.470 
do these problems and you know this ones
maybe<00:00:35.100> not<00:00:35.340> so<00:00:35.550> bad<00:00:35.760> but<00:00:36.059> I<00:00:36.090> think<00:00:36.300> it<00:00:36.420> will

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
maybe not so bad but I think it will

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.030 
maybe not so bad but I think it will
come<00:00:36.660> in<00:00:36.750> useful<00:00:36.870> especially<00:00:37.649> in<00:00:37.710> some<00:00:37.860> of<00:00:37.890> the

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
come in useful especially in some of the

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.520 
come in useful especially in some of the
others<00:00:38.280> I<00:00:38.489> like<00:00:39.030> to<00:00:39.120> use<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.540> little<00:00:40.140> acronym

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
others I like to use the little acronym

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.650 
others I like to use the little acronym
dreads<00:00:41.340> and<00:00:42.079> what<00:00:43.079> this<00:00:43.200> stands<00:00:43.500> for<00:00:43.770> is<00:00:44.100> the<00:00:44.660> D

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
dreads and what this stands for is the D

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.209 
dreads and what this stands for is the D
stands<00:00:45.989> for<00:00:46.110> draw<00:00:46.469> diagram<00:00:48.530> the<00:00:49.530> R<00:00:49.680> stands<00:00:50.100> for

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
stands for draw diagram the R stands for

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.090 
stands for draw diagram the R stands for
label<00:00:50.730> rates<00:00:51.210> so<00:00:52.050> when<00:00:52.170> we<00:00:52.260> label<00:00:52.440> rates<00:00:52.860> will

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
label rates so when we label rates will

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:58.099 
label rates so when we label rates will
usually<00:00:53.250> have<00:00:53.550> stuff<00:00:53.820> like<00:00:54.170> dx/dt<00:00:55.170> dy/dt<00:00:57.109> and

00:00:58.099 --> 00:00:58.109 
usually have stuff like dx/dt dy/dt and

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.860 
usually have stuff like dx/dt dy/dt and
usually<00:00:59.010> we'll<00:00:59.190> be<00:00:59.280> using<00:00:59.489> DT<00:01:00.030> if<00:01:00.329> things<00:01:00.660> are

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
usually we'll be using DT if things are

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.410 
usually we'll be using DT if things are
changing<00:01:01.379> well<00:01:02.370> we<00:01:02.460> use<00:01:02.609> DT<00:01:02.940> if<00:01:03.090> things<00:01:03.300> are

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:03.420 
changing well we use DT if things are

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.750 
changing well we use DT if things are
changing<00:01:03.780> with<00:01:03.899> respect<00:01:03.930> to<00:01:04.320> time<00:01:04.619> and<00:01:04.860> a<00:01:04.920> lot

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
changing with respect to time and a lot

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:06.920 
changing with respect to time and a lot
of<00:01:05.880> these<00:01:05.939> problems<00:01:06.270> that's<00:01:06.780> what's

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
of these problems that's what's

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.140 
of these problems that's what's
happening<00:01:07.320> sort<00:01:07.560> of<00:01:07.619> time<00:01:07.830> is<00:01:08.070> increasing<00:01:09.000> and

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
happening sort of time is increasing and

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.179 
happening sort of time is increasing and
we<00:01:09.540> want<00:01:09.689> to<00:01:09.750> know<00:01:09.840> what<00:01:10.049> happens<00:01:10.439> the<00:01:11.159> e

00:01:11.179 --> 00:01:11.189 
we want to know what happens the e

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:16.370 
we want to know what happens the e
stands<00:01:11.850> for<00:01:12.000> come<00:01:12.299> up<00:01:12.450> with<00:01:12.600> an<00:01:12.689> equation<00:01:15.380> the

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
stands for come up with an equation the

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:19.760 
stands for come up with an equation the
d<00:01:16.590> stands<00:01:16.950> for<00:01:17.070> take<00:01:17.490> a<00:01:17.520> derivative<00:01:18.590> again<00:01:19.590> we

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:19.770 
d stands for take a derivative again we

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:21.080 
d stands for take a derivative again we
often<00:01:20.250> have<00:01:20.430> to<00:01:20.549> use<00:01:20.759> implicit

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
often have to use implicit

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.020 
often have to use implicit
differentiation<00:01:21.930> when<00:01:22.530> we<00:01:22.619> do<00:01:22.770> this<00:01:22.979> and<00:01:23.310> the

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
differentiation when we do this and the

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.230 
differentiation when we do this and the
last<00:01:24.240> thing<00:01:24.540> is<00:01:24.810> to<00:01:24.840> substitute<00:01:26.450> substitute

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.240 
last thing is to substitute substitute

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:34.429 
last thing is to substitute substitute
that<00:01:30.240> used<00:01:30.450> to<00:01:30.540> writing<00:01:30.780> a<00:01:32.119> top<00:01:33.119> to<00:01:33.270> bottom<00:01:33.439> so

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
that used to writing a top to bottom so

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:36.530 
that used to writing a top to bottom so
substitute<00:01:35.070> and<00:01:35.369> the<00:01:35.670> specifics<00:01:36.210> I'm<00:01:36.420> going

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
substitute and the specifics I'm going

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.260 
substitute and the specifics I'm going
to<00:01:36.600> write<00:01:36.720> that<00:01:36.810> off<00:01:36.930> to<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.110> side<00:01:37.939> ok<00:01:38.939> so<00:01:39.000> in

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:39.270 
to write that off to the side ok so in

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.090 
to write that off to the side ok so in
this<00:01:39.360> problem<00:01:39.630> we've<00:01:39.960> got<00:01:40.110> a<00:01:40.140> little<00:01:40.409> huh<00:01:40.650> you

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
this problem we've got a little huh you

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:42.410 
this problem we've got a little huh you
know<00:01:41.220> so<00:01:41.340> we<00:01:41.430> draw<00:01:41.610> our<00:01:41.759> little<00:01:41.880> pebble<00:01:42.299> in

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
know so we draw our little pebble in

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.120 
know so we draw our little pebble in
there<00:01:42.600> and<00:01:42.899> then<00:01:43.110> it<00:01:43.619> creates<00:01:43.799> a<00:01:43.979> little

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
there and then it creates a little

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.190 
there and then it creates a little
ripple<00:01:44.399> and<00:01:44.970> the<00:01:45.030> ripples<00:01:45.630> get<00:01:45.840> that<00:01:46.020> you<00:01:46.079> know

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
ripple and the ripples get that you know

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.569 
ripple and the ripples get that you know
increase<00:01:46.920> as<00:01:47.130> time<00:01:47.369> increases<00:01:48.530> so<00:01:49.530> they<00:01:50.340> tell

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
increase as time increases so they tell

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.510 
increase as time increases so they tell
us<00:01:50.790> they<00:01:51.780> tell<00:01:51.960> us<00:01:52.079> that<00:01:52.170> the<00:01:52.320> radius<00:01:53.250> of<00:01:53.430> the

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
us they tell us that the radius of the

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.160 
us they tell us that the radius of the
largest<00:01:53.820> ripple<00:01:54.329> is<00:01:54.479> increasing<00:01:55.020> at<00:01:55.140> a

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
largest ripple is increasing at a

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.800 
largest ripple is increasing at a
constant<00:01:55.560> rate<00:01:55.920> of<00:01:55.950> 6<00:01:56.340> inches<00:01:56.610> per<00:01:56.820> second<00:01:57.240> so

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
constant rate of 6 inches per second so

00:01:57.810 --> 00:01:59.420 
constant rate of 6 inches per second so
I'm<00:01:57.899> just<00:01:58.049> going<00:01:58.200> to<00:01:58.229> suppose<00:01:58.619> that<00:01:58.649> you<00:01:59.310> know

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
I'm just going to suppose that you know

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.760 
I'm just going to suppose that you know
from<00:01:59.759> where<00:02:00.270> the<00:02:00.390> pebble<00:02:00.750> is<00:02:00.899> dropped<00:02:01.229> out<00:02:01.500> to

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
from where the pebble is dropped out to

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:04.100 
from where the pebble is dropped out to
the<00:02:02.040> largest<00:02:02.520> ripple<00:02:02.880> that<00:02:03.299> has<00:02:03.450> a<00:02:03.479> radius<00:02:03.930> of

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
the largest ripple that has a radius of

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.639 
the largest ripple that has a radius of
R<00:02:04.610> so<00:02:05.610> now<00:02:05.759> I<00:02:05.790> can<00:02:06.119> express<00:02:06.600> this<00:02:06.960> idea<00:02:07.259> that

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
R so now I can express this idea that

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:10.850 
R so now I can express this idea that
the<00:02:07.799> rate<00:02:08.069> is<00:02:08.340> changing<00:02:09.530> that<00:02:10.530> the<00:02:10.590> rate<00:02:10.830> of

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
the rate is changing that the rate of

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.380 
the rate is changing that the rate of
change<00:02:10.979> is<00:02:11.459> 6<00:02:11.730> inches<00:02:11.910> per<00:02:12.239> second

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
change is 6 inches per second

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.180 
change is 6 inches per second
again<00:02:13.600> what's<00:02:13.810> changing<00:02:14.350> at<00:02:14.470> six<00:02:14.740> inches<00:02:14.920> per

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
again what's changing at six inches per

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.420 
again what's changing at six inches per
second<00:02:15.610> well<00:02:16.180> the<00:02:16.300> radius<00:02:16.690> is<00:02:16.990> and<00:02:17.470> rates<00:02:18.250> of

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:18.430 
second well the radius is and rates of

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.310 
second well the radius is and rates of
change<00:02:18.670> are<00:02:18.850> described<00:02:19.210> by<00:02:19.330> derivatives<00:02:19.930> so

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:20.320 
change are described by derivatives so

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:22.050 
change are described by derivatives so
we<00:02:20.470> can<00:02:20.590> say<00:02:20.740> the<00:02:20.860> change<00:02:21.070> in<00:02:21.310> radius<00:02:21.640> with

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:22.060 
we can say the change in radius with

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:25.710 
we can say the change in radius with
respect<00:02:22.090> to<00:02:22.960> time<00:02:23.220> equals<00:02:24.220> six<00:02:24.670> inches<00:02:25.180> per

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
respect to time equals six inches per

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.250 
respect to time equals six inches per
second<00:02:27.030> okay<00:02:28.030> we<00:02:28.510> want<00:02:28.690> to<00:02:28.750> figure<00:02:28.870> out<00:02:29.050> what's

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
second okay we want to figure out what's

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.170 
second okay we want to figure out what's
the<00:02:29.350> increase<00:02:29.770> in<00:02:29.980> the<00:02:30.070> circumference<00:02:30.700> of<00:02:31.000> the

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
the increase in the circumference of the

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.600 
the increase in the circumference of the
ripple<00:02:31.620> okay<00:02:32.620> so<00:02:32.680> I'm<00:02:32.860> trying<00:02:33.160> to<00:02:33.190> find<00:02:33.460> the

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
ripple okay so I'm trying to find the

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:35.910 
ripple okay so I'm trying to find the
change<00:02:33.940> in<00:02:34.390> the<00:02:34.600> circumference<00:02:35.350> is<00:02:35.710> what<00:02:35.890> I

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
change in the circumference is what I

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.520 
change in the circumference is what I
want<00:02:36.220> to<00:02:36.280> know<00:02:37.080> okay<00:02:38.080> I<00:02:38.110> want<00:02:38.290> to<00:02:38.320> know<00:02:38.380> the

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
want to know okay I want to know the

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.400 
want to know okay I want to know the
change<00:02:38.800> in<00:02:38.980> the<00:02:39.040> circumference<00:02:40.110> after<00:02:41.110> three

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:41.410 
change in the circumference after three

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:43.650 
change in the circumference after three
seconds<00:02:41.800> of<00:02:41.920> past<00:02:42.190> so<00:02:42.670> basically<00:02:43.150> we<00:02:43.420> want<00:02:43.570> to

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 
seconds of past so basically we want to

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:49.949 
seconds of past so basically we want to
figure<00:02:43.810> out<00:02:44.040> that<00:02:45.040> when<00:02:46.080> T<00:02:47.080> equals<00:02:47.770> three<00:02:48.959> okay

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
figure out that when T equals three okay

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:51.690 
figure out that when T equals three okay
so<00:02:50.020> we've<00:02:50.680> kind<00:02:50.890> of<00:02:50.950> got<00:02:51.220> our<00:02:51.310> little<00:02:51.459> diagram

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:51.700 
so we've kind of got our little diagram

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:54.449 
so we've kind of got our little diagram
we've<00:02:52.390> labeled<00:02:52.660> our<00:02:52.959> rates<00:02:53.260> now<00:02:53.560> the<00:02:54.190> next

00:02:54.449 --> 00:02:54.459 
we've labeled our rates now the next

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:56.760 
we've labeled our rates now the next
thing<00:02:54.580> is<00:02:54.730> we<00:02:54.880> need<00:02:54.910> an<00:02:55.120> equation<00:02:55.530> well<00:02:56.530> we're

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:56.770 
thing is we need an equation well we're

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:58.260 
thing is we need an equation well we're
trying<00:02:56.920> to<00:02:57.100> figure<00:02:57.250> out<00:02:57.430> you<00:02:57.880> know<00:02:57.910> how<00:02:58.209> the

00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:58.270 
trying to figure out you know how the

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:01.020 
trying to figure out you know how the
circumference<00:02:59.020> changes<00:02:59.739> so<00:03:00.340> I'm<00:03:00.730> just<00:03:00.910> going

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
circumference changes so I'm just going

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.060 
circumference changes so I'm just going
to<00:03:01.060> use<00:03:01.390> well<00:03:01.690> the<00:03:02.020> formula<00:03:02.530> that<00:03:02.560> tells<00:03:02.830> me

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:03.070 
to use well the formula that tells me

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:05.280 
to use well the formula that tells me
circumference<00:03:03.550> of<00:03:03.730> a<00:03:03.820> circle<00:03:04.290> circumference

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:05.290 
circumference of a circle circumference

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.229 
circumference of a circle circumference
of<00:03:05.470> a<00:03:05.560> circle<00:03:05.590> has<00:03:06.190> just<00:03:06.400> given<00:03:06.640> by<00:03:06.760> two<00:03:06.820> pi

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239 
of a circle has just given by two pi

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:10.050 
of a circle has just given by two pi
times<00:03:07.780> R<00:03:08.230> and<00:03:08.560> now<00:03:09.370> I'm<00:03:09.489> going<00:03:09.700> to<00:03:09.760> take<00:03:09.910> the

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060 
times R and now I'm going to take the

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:11.670 
times R and now I'm going to take the
derivative<00:03:10.180> and<00:03:10.690> in<00:03:10.930> this<00:03:11.020> case<00:03:11.260> I'm<00:03:11.470> going<00:03:11.620> to

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
derivative and in this case I'm going to

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:13.530 
derivative and in this case I'm going to
take<00:03:11.830> the<00:03:11.950> derivative<00:03:12.070> with<00:03:12.610> respect<00:03:13.030> to<00:03:13.150> time

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
take the derivative with respect to time

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:15.479 
take the derivative with respect to time
again<00:03:14.500> that's<00:03:14.680> whatever<00:03:15.100> is<00:03:15.310> in<00:03:15.400> the

00:03:15.479 --> 00:03:15.489 
again that's whatever is in the

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:16.740 
again that's whatever is in the
denominator<00:03:15.610> that's<00:03:16.239> what<00:03:16.450> you're<00:03:16.570> taking

00:03:16.740 --> 00:03:16.750 
denominator that's what you're taking

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.500 
denominator that's what you're taking
the<00:03:16.989> derivative<00:03:17.140> with<00:03:17.680> respect<00:03:18.070> to<00:03:18.360> but<00:03:19.360> now

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:19.510 
the derivative with respect to but now

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:20.910 
the derivative with respect to but now
we<00:03:19.570> have<00:03:19.810> to<00:03:19.930> remember<00:03:20.170> to<00:03:20.350> use<00:03:20.440> implicit

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:20.920 
we have to remember to use implicit

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:24.660 
we have to remember to use implicit
differentiation<00:03:22.380> so<00:03:23.380> on<00:03:23.500> the<00:03:23.590> left<00:03:23.830> side<00:03:23.920> if<00:03:24.459> I

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
differentiation so on the left side if I

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:27.030 
differentiation so on the left side if I
take<00:03:24.880> the<00:03:25.030> derivative<00:03:25.510> of<00:03:25.630> one<00:03:25.959> C<00:03:26.290> I<00:03:26.620> would<00:03:26.890> get

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.040 
take the derivative of one C I would get

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.400 
take the derivative of one C I would get
one<00:03:27.400> but<00:03:28.150> then<00:03:28.299> I<00:03:28.390> have<00:03:28.510> to<00:03:28.630> multiply<00:03:28.810> by<00:03:29.140> the

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410 
one but then I have to multiply by the

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:34.949 
one but then I have to multiply by the
DC<00:03:30.269> DT<00:03:31.410> 2<00:03:32.410> pi<00:03:32.620> that's<00:03:33.100> just<00:03:33.340> a<00:03:33.459> constant<00:03:33.880> if<00:03:34.870> I

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959 
DC DT 2 pi that's just a constant if I

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:38.250 
DC DT 2 pi that's just a constant if I
take<00:03:35.170> the<00:03:35.320> derivative<00:03:35.440> of<00:03:35.860> R<00:03:36.100> I'll<00:03:36.459> get<00:03:36.760> 1<00:03:37.090> D<00:03:38.049> R

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:38.260 
take the derivative of R I'll get 1 D R

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:42.360 
take the derivative of R I'll get 1 D R
times<00:03:39.160> DT<00:03:40.060> and<00:03:40.650> now<00:03:41.650> I'm<00:03:42.010> just<00:03:42.040> going<00:03:42.340> to

no<00:04:04.330> T<00:04:04.780> in<00:04:04.989> this<00:04:05.110> formula<00:04:05.680> so<00:04:06.250> really<00:04:06.549> what<00:04:06.700> it

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:06.790 
no T in this formula so really what it

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:08.250 
no T in this formula so really what it
says<00:04:07.030> it<00:04:07.239> says<00:04:07.390> the<00:04:07.540> change<00:04:07.840> in<00:04:08.140> the

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:08.260 
says it says the change in the

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.080 
says it says the change in the
circumference<00:04:08.799> with<00:04:09.040> respect<00:04:09.459> to<00:04:09.579> time<00:04:09.790> it's

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.090 
circumference with respect to time it's

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:12.569 
circumference with respect to time it's
actually<00:04:10.269> independent<00:04:11.079> of<00:04:11.200> the<00:04:11.320> time<00:04:11.560> okay

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:12.579 
actually independent of the time okay

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:14.819 
actually independent of the time okay
it<00:04:12.970> doesn't<00:04:13.299> really<00:04:13.450> depend<00:04:13.630> on<00:04:13.989> sort<00:04:14.590> of<00:04:14.680> how

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:14.829 
it doesn't really depend on sort of how

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:17.190 
it doesn't really depend on sort of how
long<00:04:15.160> the<00:04:16.060> you<00:04:16.209> know<00:04:16.329> the<00:04:16.570> ripples<00:04:16.900> been<00:04:17.079> out

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:17.200 
long the you know the ripples been out

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:21.510 
long the you know the ripples been out
there<00:04:18.900> so<00:04:19.900> sometimes<00:04:20.560> what<00:04:21.220> I'm<00:04:21.310> trying<00:04:21.489> to

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:21.520 
there so sometimes what I'm trying to

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:22.500 
there so sometimes what I'm trying to
say<00:04:21.640> sometimes<00:04:22.000> you<00:04:22.090> may<00:04:22.210> even<00:04:22.240> get

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:22.510 
say sometimes you may even get

00:04:22.510 --> 00:04:24.450 
say sometimes you may even get
information<00:04:23.050> that's<00:04:23.260> not<00:04:23.380> not<00:04:23.919> needed<00:04:24.340> to

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:24.460 
information that's not not needed to

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:25.430 
information that's not not needed to
plug<00:04:24.640> in

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
plug in

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.850 
plug in
but<00:04:26.220> in<00:04:26.310> this<00:04:26.430> case<00:04:26.640> we<00:04:26.970> can<00:04:27.120> say<00:04:27.240> that<00:04:27.270> DC<00:04:27.860> the

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:28.860 
but in this case we can say that DC the

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:30.650 
but in this case we can say that DC the
change<00:04:29.100> in<00:04:29.250> circumference<00:04:29.760> with<00:04:30.180> respect<00:04:30.570> to

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:30.660 
change in circumference with respect to

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:35.960 
change in circumference with respect to
time<00:04:30.870> that's<00:04:31.380> going<00:04:31.500> to<00:04:31.590> be<00:04:31.680> 2pi<00:04:34.190> dr/dt<00:04:35.190> we're

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:35.970 
time that's going to be 2pi dr/dt we're

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:39.340 
time that's going to be 2pi dr/dt we're
given<00:04:36.270> that<00:04:36.450> to<00:04:36.690> be<00:04:36.810> six<00:04:37.680> so<00:04:38.670> if<00:04:38.760> you<00:04:38.880> multiply

00:04:39.340 --> 00:04:39.350 
given that to be six so if you multiply

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:43.040 
given that to be six so if you multiply
6<00:04:40.350> times<00:04:40.410> 2pi<00:04:41.070> that<00:04:41.490> will<00:04:41.580> give<00:04:41.700> us<00:04:41.730> 12<00:04:42.270> pi<00:04:42.630> and

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.050 
6 times 2pi that will give us 12 pi and

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:45.320 
6 times 2pi that will give us 12 pi and
so<00:04:43.950> it<00:04:44.310> says<00:04:44.490> the<00:04:44.640> circumference<00:04:45.120> is

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:45.330 
so it says the circumference is

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:50.000 
so it says the circumference is
increasing<00:04:45.990> at<00:04:46.080> a<00:04:46.110> rate<00:04:46.320> of<00:04:46.530> 12<00:04:46.950> pi<00:04:47.390> inches<00:04:49.010> per

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:50.010 
increasing at a rate of 12 pi inches per

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:53.090 
increasing at a rate of 12 pi inches per
second<00:04:50.790> and<00:04:51.240> that's<00:04:52.020> all<00:04:52.260> there<00:04:52.410> is<00:04:52.500> to<00:04:52.710> it<00:04:52.860> so

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:53.100 
second and that's all there is to it so

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:55.250 
second and that's all there is to it so
again<00:04:53.880> some<00:04:54.060> of<00:04:54.150> these<00:04:54.240> can<00:04:54.450> be<00:04:54.540> pretty<00:04:54.720> tricky

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:55.260 
again some of these can be pretty tricky

00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:59.150 
again some of these can be pretty tricky
this<00:04:56.070> kind<00:04:56.340> of<00:04:56.430> usually<00:04:56.730> helps<00:04:57.030> me<00:04:58.100> when<00:04:59.100> I

00:04:59.150 --> 00:04:59.160 
this kind of usually helps me when I

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:00.680 
this kind of usually helps me when I
used<00:04:59.220> to<00:04:59.460> do<00:04:59.580> these<00:04:59.700> problems<00:04:59.970> I<00:05:00.360> would<00:05:00.540> always

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:00.690 
used to do these problems I would always

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:02.300 
used to do these problems I would always
forget<00:05:01.140> to<00:05:01.170> do<00:05:01.860> the<00:05:02.010> implicit

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:02.310 
forget to do the implicit

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:03.770 
forget to do the implicit
differentiation<00:05:02.700> I<00:05:03.300> would<00:05:03.420> forget<00:05:03.660> to

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:03.780 
differentiation I would forget to

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:07.430 
differentiation I would forget to
multiply<00:05:03.900> by<00:05:04.290> DC<00:05:04.710> DT<00:05:04.920> and<00:05:05.520> D<00:05:06.090> R<00:05:06.240> DT<00:05:06.480> and<00:05:06.960> this

00:05:07.430 --> 00:05:07.440 
multiply by DC DT and D R DT and this

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:09.260 
multiply by DC DT and D R DT and this
way<00:05:07.590> if<00:05:07.710> I<00:05:07.800> label<00:05:08.250> them<00:05:08.340> at<00:05:08.460> the<00:05:08.550> beginning<00:05:09.000> you

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:09.270 
way if I label them at the beginning you

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:10.730 
way if I label them at the beginning you
know<00:05:09.300> I<00:05:09.390> would<00:05:09.720> go<00:05:09.840> through<00:05:10.050> this<00:05:10.140> problem<00:05:10.440> and

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:10.740 
know I would go through this problem and

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:12.560 
know I would go through this problem and
say<00:05:10.860> hey<00:05:11.040> you<00:05:11.580> know<00:05:11.700> there's<00:05:11.880> no<00:05:12.030> dr/dt

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:12.570 
say hey you know there's no dr/dt

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:15.020 
say hey you know there's no dr/dt
there's<00:05:13.050> no<00:05:13.170> DC<00:05:13.530> DT<00:05:13.740> oh<00:05:13.890> yeah<00:05:14.310> I<00:05:14.340> forgot<00:05:14.610> to<00:05:14.790> do

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:15.030 
there's no DC DT oh yeah I forgot to do

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:16.550 
there's no DC DT oh yeah I forgot to do
that<00:05:15.210> stuff<00:05:15.510> I<00:05:15.630> need<00:05:15.780> to<00:05:15.810> go<00:05:15.960> back<00:05:16.140> and<00:05:16.260> put<00:05:16.440> it

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:16.560 
that stuff I need to go back and put it

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:19.060 
that stuff I need to go back and put it
in<00:05:16.650> there<00:05:16.860> at<00:05:17.040> the<00:05:17.220> appropriate<00:05:17.700> place<00:05:17.940> so

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:19.070 
in there at the appropriate place so

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:22.070 
in there at the appropriate place so
alright<00:05:20.070> I<00:05:20.790> hope<00:05:21.120> this<00:05:21.300> question<00:05:21.690> makes<00:05:21.900> them

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:22.080 
alright I hope this question makes them

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.380 
alright I hope this question makes them
sense<00:05:22.350> again<00:05:23.190> these<00:05:23.310> can<00:05:23.460> be<00:05:23.580> tricky<00:05:23.880> problems

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:24.390 
sense again these can be tricky problems

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:26.990 
sense again these can be tricky problems
for<00:05:24.660> sure<00:05:24.810> the<00:05:25.020> first<00:05:25.170> few<00:05:25.440> times<00:05:25.560> even<00:05:26.550> after

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:27.000 
for sure the first few times even after

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.050 
for sure the first few times even after
that<00:05:27.330> so<00:05:28.310> you<00:05:29.310> know<00:05:29.430> hang<00:05:29.700> in<00:05:29.850> there<00:05:29.970> if

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:30.060 
that so you know hang in there if

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:32.150 
that so you know hang in there if
they're<00:05:30.180> confusing<00:05:30.740> hopefully<00:05:31.740> you<00:05:32.040> know

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:32.160 
they're confusing hopefully you know

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:33.409 
they're confusing hopefully you know
it's<00:05:32.550> just<00:05:32.700> like<00:05:32.880> anything<00:05:33.120> a<00:05:33.330> little

00:05:33.409 --> 00:05:33.419 
it's just like anything a little

00:05:33.419 --> 00:05:36.890 
it's just like anything a little
practice<00:05:33.930> and<00:05:34.110> they<00:05:34.380> should<00:05:34.590> get<00:05:34.770> better
