00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:07.840
 well now let's explain how it 

00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:11.259
 make the change to cheat the water that 

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:17.740
 is located under the exhaust manifold 

00:00:11.259 --> 00:00:23.140
 of the engine is a motor fiat 147 engine 

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:27.960
 1300 and if they detect that they have lost water 

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:27.960
 below the exhaust manifold 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:35.510
 it usually rots knowledge of 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:37.300
 by itself passage of time 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:40.420
 good 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.710
 as I said this is the year that 

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.230
 we need to change that for the 

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:48.010
 minerals that rots and caused a 

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:50.290
 loss of water in that sector of the engine 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.180
 to be able to make the change of this 

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:54.430
 we're going to have to draw this 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:58.300
 champagne that some cars have it 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:01:01.150
 others that covers the multiple escape of 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:04.030
 admission and has usually is 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:06.659
 mouth located in this place for the 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:10.310
 heating system 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:12.630
 to get this chapÃ³ let's use 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:15.390
 with her 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:18.190
 number 13 which is usually the 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:21.930
 as they have the nuts 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:25.470
 in this part of the out 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:28.920
 apart from taking out the screws that 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:31.500
 hold this plug to the intake manifold 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.770
 you also need to perform the 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:37.530
 disconnection of the throttle cable and 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:42.119
 the spring that makes the accelerator 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:44.250
 return to your home position well a 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.160
 Once it's done well, there's no end to 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.510
 nuts that hold the sheet 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:51.930
 disconnected to the accelerator and the spring 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:54.600
 of the same let's proceed 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:58.370
 move the sheet until you want to fit 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.370
 of the place because it has a box 

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:08.810
 well in this way we can observe the 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:11.870
 multiple multiple intake exhaust and the 

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:14.440
 cane of which we are talking about we are going 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:18.160
 to make the change of this pipe pass 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:21.940
 traverses in multiple layers below 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:25.540
 and joins the water pump that is 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:28.240
 here and you have to take out this screw 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:32.980
 and a screw that can not be seen from 

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:36.290
 inner side of the spout to be able 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:39.599
 remove it and place the new part 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:43.480
 to remove these hot springs again 

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:47.610
 we will use key number 13 or average 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.610
 to be able to extract these screws 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:53.890
 the only thing that is already is will only serve 

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:55.600
 to extract the side of the screw in the 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:57.910
 since the external inner side 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:01.000
 we will need another type tool like 

00:02:57.910 --> 00:03:03.250
 a number three is when a tube with 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.610
 an extension that allows us to reach 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:08.980
 place where said screw is located 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:10.740
 well as I mentioned for goalkeeper of 

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:13.300
 screw that is on the side 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:15.640
 internal of the pipe 

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:18.220
 we are going to need in this case one the 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:20.620
 number 13 that has the length not 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:23.590
 necessary to be able to loosen the screw 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:26.520
 from a place that allows us to do the 

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.520
 force corresponds 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:31.160
 let's go through this side 

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:03.940
 once opening the eyes with the 

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:06.530
 tool you can allow more 

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:08.780
 loosen it finish loosening the 

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:12.080
 screw with the hand as the case that 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:14.840
 our hands obviously enter the 

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:16.850
 where is the screw in this 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:18.920
 otherwise we want to remove it in its 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:22.510
 Totally screw with the tool 

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:22.510
 that we use the prince 

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:25.770
 AHA 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:34.810
 having extracted the broken piece could 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:37.300
 we can see that in this vehicle like this 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:39.300
 has tried to repair it with various 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:41.980
 glues things that are not due 

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:44.290
 processes that should not be done since 

00:04:41.980 --> 00:04:46.240
 This is what allows cooling 

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:47.890
 of the engine and if in the case of this 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:50.800
 be in perfect condition like 

00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:54.130
 is this new piece can cause 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:56.980
 we break the engine completely 

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:59.350
 melting it or breaking various pieces 

00:04:56.980 --> 00:05:01.600
 of the engine as it can be not only 

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:03.960
 melt it but fissure cylinder cap 

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.960
 and else 

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:12.219
 well before placing the new piece 

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:14.889
 let's proceed to put glue 

00:05:12.219 --> 00:05:18.370
 resistant to high temperatures and 

00:05:14.889 --> 00:05:21.189
 corresponding board to be able to seal 

00:05:18.370 --> 00:05:23.460
 the union of this piece with the pump 

00:05:21.189 --> 00:05:23.460
 Water 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:29.050
 so in this way we will avoid by 

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:32.199
 supposed losses of water that can 

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:35.400
 cause problems with the system 

00:05:32.199 --> 00:05:35.400
 engine cooling 

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:45.020
 having placed either once a piece 

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:47.780
 new in the replacement in which we remove 

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:50.180
 let's proceed to place the hoses 

00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:52.910
 that we removed in the beginning for 

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:55.240
 perform what was the drain of the 

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:59.000
 water circuit for which 

00:05:55.240 --> 00:06:01.880
 we disconnected the hose that connects the 

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:06.230
 piece and replace hose 

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:08.270
 the lower part of the radiator that was 

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:10.130
 what we needed to be able to empty 

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:12.560
 the water circuit and that would allow us 

00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:16.740
 review in a cleaner way the 

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:19.560
 change of the part breakdown 

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:21.810
 well once we have placed the 

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:24.420
 hoses that we have removed for the 

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:27.930
 emptying the circuit 

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:30.720
 let's proceed to fill the circuit 

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:33.150
 the radiator with water to check that 

00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:36.450
 there has not been any loss in the 

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:38.850
 piece that we replaced to be 

00:06:36.450 --> 00:06:40.890
 properly tight should not have 

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:43.260
 no type of loss either in the 

00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:45.990
 union with the water pump here below 

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:49.470
 the multiple as in the hoses that 

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:50.910
 we have placed again having 

00:06:49.470 --> 00:06:52.980
 proven that there is no type of 

00:06:50.910 --> 00:06:54.840
 loss we can proceed to place 

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:57.090
 again the flat and place the 

00:06:54.840 --> 00:07:00.960
 spring and throttle cable that 

00:06:57.090 --> 00:07:02.670
 we remove to melt to be able to remove 

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:04.370
 what is the plug that goes up to the 

00:07:02.670 --> 00:07:06.979
 mountain 

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:10.669
 good once having placed the 

00:07:06.979 --> 00:07:13.220
 pacifier that covers the multiple the cable 

00:07:10.669 --> 00:07:15.500
 of the accelerator in the spring is 

00:07:13.220 --> 00:07:17.840
 recommended again 

00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:20.690
 remove the hose from the bottom 

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:22.850
 of the radiator to perform what is the 

00:07:20.690 --> 00:07:25.550
 emptying the circuit is to go pulling all 

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:27.590
 the water re-position the hose and 

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:30.199
 Fill the cooling circuit with 

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:34.070
 distilled water and an antifreeze and 

00:07:30.199 --> 00:07:37.070
 refrigerant of a brand within what 

00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:40.030
 possible good as it suits your 

00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:40.030
 pocket to purchase
