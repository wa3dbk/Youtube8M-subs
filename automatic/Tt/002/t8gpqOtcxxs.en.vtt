00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
on them this in fact was brought as a

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.580 
on them this in fact was brought as a
seed<00:01:28.290> for<00:01:29.250> yellow<00:01:29.729> with<00:01:29.909> stripes<00:01:30.540> on<00:01:30.780> it<00:01:30.930> but

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
seed for yellow with stripes on it but

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.520 
seed for yellow with stripes on it but
it<00:01:31.710> started<00:01:32.159> blooming<00:01:32.900> coral<00:01:33.900> color<00:01:34.110> flowers

also<00:01:34.740> it's<00:01:35.280> the<00:01:35.400> same<00:01:35.670> plant<00:01:36.079> initially<00:01:37.079> I

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
also it's the same plant initially I

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.960 
also it's the same plant initially I
thought<00:01:37.409> this<00:01:37.770> could<00:01:38.070> be<00:01:38.130> two<00:01:38.549> different

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
thought this could be two different

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.179 
thought this could be two different
plants<00:01:39.210> but<00:01:39.540> half<00:01:40.320> of<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.650> plant<00:01:40.890> blooms

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
plants but half of the plant blooms

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.340 
plants but half of the plant blooms
coral<00:01:41.939> colors<00:01:42.270> and<00:01:42.509> the<00:01:42.600> other<00:01:42.720> half<00:01:43.020> blooms

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
coral colors and the other half blooms

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.260 
coral colors and the other half blooms
yellow<00:01:43.759> it's<00:01:44.759> not<00:01:44.880> grafted<00:01:45.689> and<00:01:46.820> I<00:01:47.820> don't<00:01:48.060> know

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
yellow it's not grafted and I don't know

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:54.289 
yellow it's not grafted and I don't know
if<00:01:48.509> this<00:01:48.930> happens<00:01:49.350> often<00:01:49.649> and<00:01:49.979> for<00:01:50.640> clocks<00:01:53.299> so

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
if this happens often and for clocks so

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:57.740 
if this happens often and for clocks so
I<00:01:54.329> decided<00:01:54.930> to<00:01:55.140> keep<00:01:55.320> this<00:01:56.299> just<00:01:57.299> to<00:01:57.479> see<00:01:57.630> how

00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:57.750 
I decided to keep this just to see how

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.440 
I decided to keep this just to see how
this<00:01:57.899> is<00:01:58.079> going<00:01:58.259> to<00:01:58.350> turn<00:01:58.530> out<00:01:58.880> so<00:01:59.880> if<00:02:00.000> I<00:02:00.090> plant

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:00.450 
this is going to turn out so if I plant

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.300 
this is going to turn out so if I plant
the<00:02:00.630> seeds<00:02:00.899> I<00:02:01.049> don't<00:02:01.229> know<00:02:01.320> what<00:02:01.649> is<00:02:01.860> going<00:02:02.189> to

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310 
the seeds I don't know what is going to
