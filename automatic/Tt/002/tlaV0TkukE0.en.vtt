00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:36.220 
right by alterna is better on wet hair I

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.400 
right by alterna is better on wet hair I
find<00:01:36.610> and<00:01:36.910> then<00:01:37.420> rub<00:01:37.840> this<00:01:38.050> throughout<00:01:38.350> your

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.320 

moving<00:01:44.649> on<00:01:44.770> to<00:01:45.039> actually<00:01:45.490> curling<00:01:45.940> our<00:01:46.090> hair

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:46.330 
moving on to actually curling our hair

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:48.029 
moving on to actually curling our hair
so<00:01:46.720> you're<00:01:46.869> going<00:01:47.110> to<00:01:47.170> grab<00:01:47.320> about<00:01:47.590> one-inch

00:01:48.029 --> 00:01:48.039 
so you're going to grab about one-inch

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:50.490 
so you're going to grab about one-inch
sections<00:01:48.580> and<00:01:48.850> take<00:01:49.600> your<00:01:49.750> wand<00:01:49.990> and<00:01:50.259> wrap

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:50.500 
sections and take your wand and wrap

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.609 
sections and take your wand and wrap
your<00:01:50.679> hair<00:01:50.950> away<00:01:51.250> from<00:01:51.520> your<00:01:51.970> face<00:01:52.210> so<00:01:52.869> I

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:53.619 
your hair away from your face so I

00:01:53.619 --> 00:01:55.890 
your hair away from your face so I
usually<00:01:54.520> leave<00:01:54.789> a<00:01:54.850> little<00:01:55.270> bit<00:01:55.420> out<00:01:55.600> on<00:01:55.810> the

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:55.900 
usually leave a little bit out on the

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:59.429 
usually leave a little bit out on the
ends<00:01:56.350> and<00:01:56.530> I<00:01:56.710> don't<00:01:57.130> typically<00:01:58.049> wrap<00:01:59.049> it<00:01:59.229> all

00:01:59.429 --> 00:01:59.439 
ends and I don't typically wrap it all

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:02.399 
ends and I don't typically wrap it all
the<00:01:59.590> way<00:01:59.740> like<00:01:59.979> tight<00:02:00.340> to<00:02:00.549> my<00:02:00.729> scalp<00:02:01.150> this<00:02:02.110> just

the way like tight to my scalp this just

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:06.120 
the way like tight to my scalp this just
gives<00:02:02.590> you<00:02:02.740> a<00:02:03.009> more<00:02:03.460> relaxed<00:02:04.210> beachy<00:02:05.110> curl<00:02:05.500> you

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:45.140 
I'll curl those all the way around but

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:46.960 
I'll curl those all the way around but
some<00:02:45.530> of<00:02:45.650> the<00:02:45.770> pieces<00:02:46.100> kind<00:02:46.490> of<00:02:46.580> the<00:02:46.670> middle

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
some of the pieces kind of the middle

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:48.220 
some of the pieces kind of the middle
sections<00:02:47.600> of<00:02:47.720> my<00:02:47.810> hair

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:48.230 
sections of my hair

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.530 
sections of my hair
they're<00:02:48.830> usually<00:02:49.250> tighter<00:02:49.850> and<00:02:50.060> curl<00:02:50.330> like

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
they're usually tighter and curl like

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:52.210 
they're usually tighter and curl like
when<00:02:50.750> I<00:02:50.780> wake<00:02:50.990> up<00:02:51.020> so<00:02:51.410> I<00:02:51.440> don't<00:02:51.710> have<00:02:51.800> to<00:02:51.980> curl

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
when I wake up so I don't have to curl

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.280 
when I wake up so I don't have to curl
every<00:02:52.370> piece<00:02:52.670> which<00:02:52.880> is<00:02:52.910> good<00:02:53.180> because<00:02:53.390> the

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290 
every piece which is good because the

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.260 
every piece which is good because the
less<00:02:54.500> you<00:02:54.650> to<00:02:54.800> curl<00:02:55.010> the<00:02:55.160> better<00:02:55.430> because<00:02:56.060> you

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:56.270 
less you to curl the better because you

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:05.670 
less you to curl the better because you
are<00:02:56.300> damaging<00:02:57.260> and<00:02:57.680> less<00:02:57.800> of<00:02:57.950> your<00:02:58.040> hair

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:05.680 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:08.170 

so<00:03:06.680> as<00:03:06.830> you<00:03:06.920> can<00:03:07.010> see<00:03:07.069> this<00:03:07.340> takes<00:03:07.610> me<00:03:07.790> kind<00:03:08.090> of

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
so as you can see this takes me kind of

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:09.940 
so as you can see this takes me kind of
a<00:03:08.239> while<00:03:08.390> I'm<00:03:08.690> even<00:03:08.989> fast-forwarding<00:03:09.620> this<00:03:09.769> I

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:09.950 
a while I'm even fast-forwarding this I

of<00:04:19.930> my<00:04:20.019> hair<00:04:20.049> and<00:04:20.380> then<00:04:20.590> I<00:04:20.620> just<00:04:20.889> backcomb<00:04:21.160> it

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:21.570

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:25.060 
towards my scalp and I do it at the top

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:27.360 
towards my scalp and I do it at the top
of<00:04:25.270> my<00:04:25.389> head<00:04:25.600> and<00:04:25.870> I<00:04:25.990> also<00:04:26.229> like<00:04:26.680> to<00:04:26.710> do<00:04:26.950> it<00:04:27.070> down

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:27.370

towards the bottom part of my hair

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:31.050

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:11.560 
it's not crunchy at all so this is a

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.170 
it's not crunchy at all so this is a
part<00:05:11.800> that<00:05:11.919> I<00:05:11.979> tell<00:05:12.129> everybody<00:05:12.430> to<00:05:12.639> do<00:05:12.729> mess<00:05:13.150> up
