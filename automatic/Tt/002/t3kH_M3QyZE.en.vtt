00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.830
 yes this year mister semtex yes and I have 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.870
 I think what do you think if 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.639
 Let's start a small competition 

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:10.139
 you make a trifle for me 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:12.570
 I make a little something for that 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.880
 you and that's why I've considered 

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:17.820
 also by the way at the moment first that 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:19.710
 gameplay is then from the nasty fettsack 16 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.130
 a really wonderful beautiful 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.359
 freefall shuffle with the p90's 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.650
 fettsack nasty has indeed me 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:26.939
 Gameplay provided what I have 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.830
 That's why I uploaded it to warriors 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.320
 definitely look at the boys 

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:33.000
 past the left in the description effect 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.630
 even with the comments I would have him 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.520
 at the beginning synonymous to watch a video 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.840
 bit we have to comment on what 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.129
 Together we look up 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.809
 In any case, any case could be 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.670
 all leave because you will definitely 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.989
 more often the gameplay of him on him 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.910
 to see a canal because he belongs 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.100
 definitely to the people to me 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.809
 Provide gameplay in the long run 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.489
 but I will on the subject but that 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.520
 She writes a lot to me about the topic 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:59.370
 often to start a tournament again 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.750
 x3 tobacco the nasty fat bag and the the 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.949
 motion hand that's three people of it 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.989
 not already uploaded a bit 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.479
 have the are exempt from this tournament 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:08.400
 those are to be seen directly if 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.750
 they are so bent on it so they stand 

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.090
 already fixed the rest is a 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.250
 tournament determines more infos about this and 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.659
 The whole tournament will definitely come first 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:18.060
 after the partner at the project because I 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.740
 before lady is totally busy but 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.530
 I'll say one in the first 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:26.729
 first round I'll give you task 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:28.080
 ask that you then into the gameplay 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.329
 I'm definitely sure 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.250
 that you have it for this competition 

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:34.350
 played at the beginning of the gameplay 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.619
 turn clockwise in a circle 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.790
 and then once in a circle 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.170
 turn once and then you can jump 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.850
 start running can do what you 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.439
 but then I want to know that 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:45.630
 She does that in the beginning that you 

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.280
 this gameplay for me and for the web 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.930
 have gambled and that is not already 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:50.070
 so a three month old thing from your 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.689
 plate is or that you like 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:53.729
 already start to earn something 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:55.590
 it's perfect for the first round 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.119
 no matter i'll do a video we will 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:59.280
 just your gameplays then as a video 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.659
 Answer the most beautiful and cleanse 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.409
 The best of them are the best for me 

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:03.600
 like 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.640
 then come down to such a close in 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.320
 right tournament so pure and there 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.539
 will also give tasks but how 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.649
 said that's all you can do 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.030
 if you 're upset yellow 

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.740
 finished as I said once in a circle 

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:14.300
 turn once 

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:16.460
 or can you do what you want us to do 

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:18.230
 I wanted to give you what you want 

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:19.300
 a tip uses something around you 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.350
 to draw attention 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.590
 fancy waffles fancy 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:27.860
 game mode a mega vetter destroyer 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:29.210
 Skoda 06 clock or I do not know what 

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:31.030
 of course for the perfectly normal or 

00:02:29.210 --> 00:02:33.350
 send in good gameplay 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.490
 it's just so i rate that 

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:36.110
 gameplay in principle, in my opinion 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:38.360
 if I like the gameplay though 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.770
 do not come this style this one 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.300
 I like to play art then come 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:43.190
 So that's not going to happen now 

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.200
 blunt who has the best kg or 

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:46.160
 Something like that will just be mine 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.990
 the opinion will be there in principle 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.790
 decides and later in the course of the 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:51.830
 tournament then the valuation of 

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.960
 people but good as I said there we come 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:55.580
 then later that's all 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:57.260
 first time back compact and first 

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:58.820

 You can do what you want for as long as possible 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:17.900
