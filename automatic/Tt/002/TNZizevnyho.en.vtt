00:00:00.083 --> 00:00:02.864
 Mirror - Mirror - I ask you 

00:00:02.863 --> 00:00:05.003
 Do you want to listen to my bird songs? (Many sentences in this episode are deliberately rhyming, but nothing makes sense) 

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:09.217
 Oh, don't bother me. 

00:00:09.217 --> 00:00:11.512
 I am very busy, you didn't see it? 

00:00:11.512 --> 00:00:14.605
 Yes, busy with reflection 

00:00:14.605 --> 00:00:16.184
 No, stupid fruit 

00:00:16.184 --> 00:00:18.785
 I am doing things for the queen, I am looking for... 

00:00:18.785 --> 00:00:20.271
 The spleen of the unicorn? 

00:00:20.271 --> 00:00:20.920
 what? 

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.175
 Fish in jeans? 

00:00:22.175 --> 00:00:23.428
 Do not! oh I got it 

00:00:23.428 --> 00:00:24.682
 It is a bean that will fart! 

00:00:24.681 --> 00:00:26.029
 To shut up! 

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:27.794
 what happened? I just want to help. 

00:00:27.794 --> 00:00:30.115
 I don't need people to help me rhyme. 

00:00:30.114 --> 00:00:32.437
 And the things you talk about don’t exist at all. 

00:00:32.438 --> 00:00:33.784
 Then let's talk to them. 

00:00:33.783 --> 00:00:37.454
 Does something not exist? Is this what the talking mirror says? 

00:00:37.454 --> 00:00:39.265
 Tell it, Greg 

00:00:42.334 --> 00:00:44.976
 It seems that the guy is really annoying (pain in the ass, disturbing things, he changed to in the gas, gas finger fart, homophonic pun) 

00:00:44.975 --> 00:00:47.045
 Really failed 

00:00:47.045 --> 00:00:49.216
 You have no help for me. 

00:00:49.216 --> 00:00:50.298
 Hey, I know where the problem is. 

00:00:50.298 --> 00:00:52.301
 You don't have a great rhythm to match the rhyme 

00:00:52.301 --> 00:00:53.469
 what? Not 

00:00:56.756 --> 00:00:57.515
 stop!! 

00:00:57.515 --> 00:00:59.188
 Fast, you are not reading rhymes 

00:00:59.188 --> 00:00:59.884
 Do not!! 

00:01:01.603 --> 00:01:03.521
 stop!! 

00:01:03.521 --> 00:01:06.710
 It seems that someone is irritating (this time I changed the pain in the butt to glass) 

00:01:06.709 --> 00:01:09.193
 This joke you just used, stupid 

00:01:09.194 --> 00:01:10.736
 Casually, McChubby (this is a kind of food like McDonald's) 

00:01:10.736 --> 00:01:12.447
 I am MC Chubby! (MC refers to the Micphone Controller, who controls the microphone, and many rappers will add MC in front of the name) 

00:01:12.447 --> 00:01:13.781
 listen 

00:01:13.781 --> 00:01:17.201
 The task of the Queen’s account requires a high level of intelligence to complete 

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.595
 I have to find the most poisonous apple in the whole kingdom. 

00:01:20.596 --> 00:01:22.546
 What? Who are you talking about? 

00:01:22.546 --> 00:01:24.467
 I want to find poison apples. 

00:01:24.466 --> 00:01:26.864
 Let Snow White eat it but I haven't found it yet. 

00:01:26.864 --> 00:01:29.280
 May I? Do you understand this? 

00:01:29.281 --> 00:01:31.230
 Hey, why don't you say it earlier? 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:32.216
 There is one over there. 

00:01:32.215 --> 00:01:33.759
 What... really? 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.061
 God, how is it so hot here? 

00:01:36.061 --> 00:01:37.180
 What? What is this? 

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.868
 This is what you want, moist apple (moistened, near poisoned apple poisoned sound) 

00:01:39.867 --> 00:01:41.634
 Really, everyone, this is super hot. 

00:01:41.634 --> 00:01:44.353
 Hot to the squirrels, they are pouring ice water into the nuts. 

00:01:45.355 --> 00:01:47.189
 how? Is there a problem? 

00:01:47.188 --> 00:01:48.877
 We like to eat ice acorns. 

00:01:48.878 --> 00:01:50.509
 I didn’t mean to pick the fault. 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:52.870
 But I am talking about poison apples! ! You stupid! ! 

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:55.614
 Hey, I understand, okay, what about that? 

00:01:55.614 --> 00:01:58.867
 Don't rely on me too close, I don't feel very comfortable 

00:01:59.953 --> 00:02:01.704
 You are so exaggerated. 

00:02:01.703 --> 00:02:03.205
 That gnome apple he is not poisonous at all 

00:02:03.206 --> 00:02:04.707
 He just can spread the disease!! (contagious will be infected with poisonous toxic sounds) 

00:02:04.706 --> 00:02:06.571
 Is Xiao Ping... 

00:02:06.572 --> 00:02:08.491
 I wish you gnome health (he changed the second half of the health gesundheit to midget) 

00:02:09.312 --> 00:02:10.937
 Time is getting closer 

00:02:10.937 --> 00:02:13.026
 I am worried that I will never find a poison apple. 

00:02:13.026 --> 00:02:15.814
 Be careful to avoid the deer that vomits in your ear! (He keeps talking and rhyming with the mirror but it doesn't make sense) 

00:02:15.813 --> 00:02:18.227
 Stop before I worry! 

00:02:18.228 --> 00:02:20.998
 Hey, do you want to shake the side and go to the truck stop to buy a mop? 

00:02:20.997 --> 00:02:22.638
 Can you be quiet? 

00:02:22.639 --> 00:02:25.379
 Please eat a balanced diet! 

00:02:27.794 --> 00:02:30.108
 Hey, everyone, I didn’t mean to bother you. 

00:02:30.108 --> 00:02:32.610
 But really, can we open a fan or something like that? 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.365
 Shut up, your wet fruit 

00:02:34.365 --> 00:02:38.116
 If I fail, I will be dismissed. 

00:02:38.116 --> 00:02:40.798
 Well, then there is snow coming. 

00:02:40.798 --> 00:02:42.663
 really? Sounds great 

00:02:42.663 --> 00:02:44.538
 No, not snow, it is snow 

00:02:44.538 --> 00:02:45.665
 What is slow? 

00:02:45.664 --> 00:02:46.834
 snow White! 

00:02:46.835 --> 00:02:48.105
 Hey, delicious apple! 

00:02:50.377 --> 00:02:51.803
 Oh, I don't feel very comfortable. 

00:02:52.965 --> 00:02:55.920
 It seems that Snow White is really a weirdo. 

00:02:55.919 --> 00:02:57.793
 Oh my god, it turned out that I was wrong. 

00:02:57.794 --> 00:03:00.007
 That apple has been poisonous!! 

00:03:00.007 --> 00:03:02.103
 Well, he used to be an apple. 

00:03:02.103 --> 00:03:05.811
 The Queen will be very happy that her wish has come true!! 

00:03:05.811 --> 00:03:07.687
 Because Snow White is getting cold. 

00:03:11.441 --> 00:03:12.562
 Dwarf apple 

00:03:14.193 --> 00:03:16.237
 lets Dance! 

00:03:22.525 --> 00:03:25.829
