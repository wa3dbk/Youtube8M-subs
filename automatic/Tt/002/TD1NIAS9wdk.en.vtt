00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
he doesn't have no shoulders I used to

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:28.780

because<00:02:29.790> shoulders<00:02:30.390> were<00:02:30.510> one<00:02:30.690> of<00:02:30.720> my<00:02:30.810> when<00:02:31.440> I

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
because shoulders were one of my when I

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.440 
because shoulders were one of my when I
was<00:02:31.650> lean<00:02:31.920> and<00:02:31.950> I<00:02:32.550> was<00:02:32.700> dieted<00:02:33.030> down<00:02:33.209> shoulders

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
was lean and I was dieted down shoulders

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.930 
was lean and I was dieted down shoulders
probably<00:02:33.840> one<00:02:33.930> of<00:02:33.959> my<00:02:34.050> biggest<00:02:34.940> achievements

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:35.940 
probably one of my biggest achievements

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:38.540 
probably one of my biggest achievements
if<00:02:36.030> I<00:02:36.180> will<00:02:36.360> because<00:02:36.690> I<00:02:36.720> always<00:02:37.319> had<00:02:37.650> that<00:02:37.920> in

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:38.550 
if I will because I always had that in

00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:39.949 
if I will because I always had that in
the<00:02:38.760> back<00:02:38.910> of<00:02:38.940> my<00:02:39.090> head<00:02:39.300> that<00:02:39.330> I<00:02:39.480> never<00:02:39.629> had<00:02:39.810> my

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
the back of my head that I never had my

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:42.350 
the back of my head that I never had my
shoulders<00:02:40.379> so<00:02:40.610> once<00:02:41.610> I<00:02:41.700> was<00:02:41.849> dieted<00:02:42.180> down<00:02:42.330> I

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:42.360 
shoulders so once I was dieted down I

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:43.880 
shoulders so once I was dieted down I
could<00:02:42.599> see<00:02:42.750> the<00:02:42.870> actual<00:02:43.080> reveal<00:02:43.470> from<00:02:43.739> them

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890

feathers in the shoulders especially

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:49.039 
feathers in the shoulders especially
when<00:02:48.090> you<00:02:48.180> do<00:02:48.299> that<00:02:48.450> pose<00:02:48.629> where<00:02:48.810> you<00:02:48.870> put<00:02:49.019> your

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.340 
your back and you tension shoulder you

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:54.530 
your back and you tension shoulder you
can<00:02:53.519> see<00:02:53.610> what<00:02:53.730> the<00:02:53.790> feathers<00:02:54.120> and<00:02:54.239> everything

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
can see what the feathers and everything

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.089 
can see what the feathers and everything
coming<00:02:54.720> in<00:02:54.900> you<00:02:55.019> get<00:02:55.140> that<00:02:55.200> nice<00:02:55.410> rounded<00:02:55.890> look

find<00:03:30.720> that<00:03:30.780> very<00:03:30.989> effective<00:03:31.440> for<00:03:31.470> me<00:03:31.709> I<00:03:31.739> rather

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:32.100 
find that very effective for me I rather

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:34.069 
find that very effective for me I rather

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
top come back down but I would stop just

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:38.270 
top come back down but I would stop just
before<00:03:36.630> that<00:03:37.079> dumbbells<00:03:37.560> hit<00:03:37.709> my<00:03:37.829> site<00:03:38.069> so

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
before that dumbbells hit my site so

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:39.979 
before that dumbbells hit my site so
that<00:03:38.310> I<00:03:38.430> was<00:03:38.519> completely<00:03:38.790> in<00:03:39.030> keeping<00:03:39.660> tension

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 
that I was completely in keeping tension

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:41.930 
that I was completely in keeping tension
on<00:03:40.230> them<00:03:40.410> all<00:03:40.590> times<00:03:40.889> I<00:03:41.160> would<00:03:41.489> literally<00:03:41.730> just

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
on them all times I would literally just

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:43.910 
on them all times I would literally just
drop<00:03:42.180> down<00:03:42.389> into<00:03:42.569> kylo<00:03:43.049> intervals<00:03:43.470> and<00:03:43.590> toils

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
drop down into kylo intervals and toils

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.670 
drop down into kylo intervals and toils
down<00:03:44.069> to<00:03:44.220> 45<00:03:44.819> kilo<00:03:45.269> dumbbells<00:03:45.720> and<00:03:45.900> I<00:03:46.410> found

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:46.680 
down to 45 kilo dumbbells and I found

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.110 
down to 45 kilo dumbbells and I found
that<00:03:46.889> that<00:03:47.069> was<00:03:47.280> a<00:03:47.310> very<00:03:47.549> effective<00:03:47.880> way<00:03:48.000> of

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
that that was a very effective way of

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.270 
that that was a very effective way of
training<00:03:48.389> my<00:03:48.569> side<00:03:48.810> deltoids<00:03:49.349> so<00:03:49.560> if<00:03:49.920> you<00:03:50.130> are

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280 
training my side deltoids so if you are

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:51.680 
training my side deltoids so if you are
having<00:03:50.519> problems<00:03:50.700> with<00:03:51.060> your<00:03:51.090> side<00:03:51.329> deals<00:03:51.569> I

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
having problems with your side deals I

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:53.390 
having problems with your side deals I
definitely<00:03:52.109> advise<00:03:52.500> you<00:03:52.650> to<00:03:52.769> try<00:03:52.920> that<00:03:53.190> a

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
definitely advise you to try that a

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.539 
definitely advise you to try that a
triple<00:03:53.880> drop<00:03:54.150> set<00:03:54.359> or<00:03:54.450> even<00:03:54.660> just<00:03:54.690> a<00:03:54.959> drop<00:03:55.290> set

00:03:55.539 --> 00:03:55.549 
triple drop set or even just a drop set

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:58.099 
triple drop set or even just a drop set
of<00:03:56.549> side<00:03:56.849> lateral<00:03:57.239> raises<00:03:57.419> and<00:03:57.690> I<00:03:57.750> found<00:03:57.930> that

00:03:58.099 --> 00:03:58.109 
of side lateral raises and I found that

00:03:58.109 --> 00:04:01.129 
of side lateral raises and I found that
to<00:03:58.260> be<00:03:58.290> a<00:03:58.410> very<00:03:58.829> good<00:03:59.130> key<00:04:00.060> to<00:04:00.239> unlock<00:04:00.599> those

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:01.139 
to be a very good key to unlock those

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:02.839 
to be a very good key to unlock those
side<00:04:01.440> deltoids<00:04:01.919> so<00:04:02.099> i<00:04:02.130> hope<00:04:02.370> this<00:04:02.400> video<00:04:02.639> has
