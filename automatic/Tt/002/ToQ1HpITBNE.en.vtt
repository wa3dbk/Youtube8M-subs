00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:04.910 
in this video we'll show you how to

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:08.470 
in this video we'll show you how to
update<00:00:05.270> your<00:00:05.780> firmware<00:00:06.400> using<00:00:07.400> Basecamp<00:00:08.179> just

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:08.480 
update your firmware using Basecamp just

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:10.119 
update your firmware using Basecamp just
garments<00:00:08.900> free<00:00:09.080> mapping<00:00:09.530> service<00:00:09.860> now<00:00:09.980> we're

00:00:10.119 --> 00:00:10.129 
garments free mapping service now we're

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:12.579 
garments free mapping service now we're
using<00:00:10.249> the<00:00:10.490> Mac<00:00:10.730> for<00:00:10.759> this<00:00:11.120> but<00:00:11.990> our<00:00:12.110> PC<00:00:12.530> should

00:00:12.579 --> 00:00:12.589 
using the Mac for this but our PC should

00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:14.619 
using the Mac for this but our PC should
be<00:00:12.769> the<00:00:12.919> same<00:00:13.129> so<00:00:13.429> we<00:00:13.549> have<00:00:13.700> our<00:00:13.820> map<00:00:14.030> 6<00:00:14.360> 2

00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:14.629 
be the same so we have our map 6 2

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:17.800 
be the same so we have our map 6 2
plugged<00:00:14.959> into<00:00:15.139> our<00:00:15.409> computer<00:00:16.130> via<00:00:16.280> USB<00:00:16.510> and<00:00:17.510> we

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:17.810 
plugged into our computer via USB and we

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:19.480 
plugged into our computer via USB and we
can<00:00:17.990> see<00:00:18.260> on<00:00:18.410> the<00:00:18.560> top<00:00:18.740> right<00:00:19.010> that<00:00:19.040> we<00:00:19.310> have<00:00:19.460> a

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:19.490 
can see on the top right that we have a

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:21.910 
can see on the top right that we have a
notification<00:00:19.880> icon<00:00:20.870> here<00:00:21.200> so<00:00:21.380> you<00:00:21.740> don't

screen either to skip the update or
apply<00:00:35.150> the<00:00:35.210> update<00:00:35.690> so<00:00:35.930> in<00:00:36.050> this<00:00:36.170> case<00:00:36.380> we're

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:36.590 
apply the update so in this case we're

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.490 
apply the update so in this case we're
going<00:00:36.710> to<00:00:36.860> apply<00:00:37.640> the<00:00:37.700> device<00:00:38.300> update<00:00:39.260> which

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:39.500 
going to apply the device update which

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.380 
going to apply the device update which
is<00:00:39.620> the<00:00:39.739> firmware<00:00:39.950> so<00:00:40.910> we're<00:00:41.030> going<00:00:41.120> to<00:00:41.180> click

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:41.390 
is the firmware so we're going to click

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:47.800 
is the firmware so we're going to click
on<00:00:41.420> that<00:00:45.550> so<00:00:46.550> what<00:00:46.730> happens<00:00:47.120> now<00:00:47.360> is<00:00:47.600> that<00:00:47.630> the

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:47.810 
on that so what happens now is that the

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:50.650 
on that so what happens now is that the
Garmin<00:00:48.380> web<00:00:48.620> updater<00:00:49.040> will<00:00:49.310> come<00:00:49.520> up<00:00:49.670> make

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:50.660 
Garmin web updater will come up make

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:51.819 
Garmin web updater will come up make
sure<00:00:50.690> you<00:00:50.870> have<00:00:50.960> the<00:00:51.050> latest<00:00:51.079> version<00:00:51.680> for

00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:51.829 
sure you have the latest version for

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:53.650 
sure you have the latest version for
that<00:00:51.980> give<00:00:52.730> you<00:00:52.790> a<00:00:52.820> little<00:00:52.970> bit<00:00:53.090> more<00:00:53.180> details

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:53.660 
that give you a little bit more details

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.520 
that give you a little bit more details
here<00:00:54.020> now<00:00:54.200> we're<00:00:54.770> using<00:00:54.950> the<00:00:55.190> map<00:00:55.399> 62<00:00:56.059> so<00:00:56.750> we'll

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:57.530 
here now we're using the map 62 so we'll

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:00.400 
here now we're using the map 62 so we'll
have<00:00:57.710> to<00:00:57.920> do<00:00:58.070> a<00:00:58.100> manual<00:00:58.460> reboot<00:00:59.450> so<00:00:59.960> let's<00:01:00.230> read

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:00.410 
have to do a manual reboot so let's read

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:02.170 
have to do a manual reboot so let's read
the<00:01:00.649> agreement<00:01:01.070> once<00:01:01.579> we're<00:01:01.790> ready<00:01:01.969> with<00:01:02.149> that

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:02.180 
the agreement once we're ready with that

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.270 
the agreement once we're ready with that
we<00:01:02.510> can<00:01:02.690> click<00:01:02.870> on<00:01:02.930> it<00:01:03.110> then<00:01:03.829> we'll<00:01:03.950> download

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:04.280 
we can click on it then we'll download

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:06.490 
we can click on it then we'll download
the<00:01:04.790> software<00:01:05.000> from<00:01:05.420> Garmin<00:01:05.930> and<00:01:06.049> then<00:01:06.290> from

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:06.500 
the software from Garmin and then from

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.200 
the software from Garmin and then from
that<00:01:06.530> it's<00:01:07.250> going<00:01:07.460> to<00:01:07.520> transfer<00:01:08.180> that

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210 
that it's going to transfer that

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.600 
that it's going to transfer that
firmware<00:01:08.990> onto<00:01:09.500> our<00:01:09.799> device<00:01:10.100> so<00:01:10.310> that<00:01:10.340> will

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:10.610 
firmware onto our device so that will

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:20.160 
firmware onto our device so that will
take<00:01:10.850> a<00:01:11.090> few<00:01:11.600> seconds

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:20.170 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.440 

and<00:01:20.470> now<00:01:20.979> we<00:01:21.040> are<00:01:21.220> done<00:01:21.460> we<00:01:21.610> can<00:01:21.640> disconnect

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:22.450 
and now we are done we can disconnect

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.860 
and now we are done we can disconnect
the<00:01:23.310> device<00:01:24.310> from<00:01:24.729> our<00:01:24.909> computer<00:01:25.300> I<00:01:25.420> just<00:01:25.690> pull

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:25.870 
the device from our computer I just pull

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:27.930 
the device from our computer I just pull
the<00:01:25.990> the<00:01:26.290> USB<00:01:26.590> cable<00:01:26.770> out<00:01:27.070> now<00:01:27.670> we're<00:01:27.790> going<00:01:27.880> to

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:27.940 
the the USB cable out now we're going to

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:29.310 
the the USB cable out now we're going to
get<00:01:28.090> a<00:01:28.150> little<00:01:28.270> error<00:01:28.450> message<00:01:28.810> because<00:01:29.140> we're

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:29.320 
get a little error message because we're

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:30.960 
get a little error message because we're
using<00:01:29.470> a<00:01:29.680> map<00:01:29.860> because<00:01:30.100> we<00:01:30.220> didn't<00:01:30.430> eject<00:01:30.580> the

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:30.970 
using a map because we didn't eject the

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:33.930 
using a map because we didn't eject the
disk<00:01:31.890> doesn't<00:01:32.890> really<00:01:33.280> affect<00:01:33.550> our<00:01:33.700> device

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:33.940 
disk doesn't really affect our device

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.210 
disk doesn't really affect our device
here<00:01:34.180> so<00:01:34.420> now<00:01:34.900> we're<00:01:35.050> back<00:01:35.200> to<00:01:35.350> our<00:01:35.380> map<00:01:35.710> 62

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:36.220 
here so now we're back to our map 62

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:37.499 
here so now we're back to our map 62
we're<00:01:36.400> just<00:01:36.580> going<00:01:36.729> to<00:01:36.759> press<00:01:37.060> the<00:01:37.270> power

00:01:37.499 --> 00:01:37.509 
we're just going to press the power

00:01:37.509 --> 00:01:39.630 
we're just going to press the power
button<00:01:37.570> to<00:01:37.900> turn<00:01:38.020> it<00:01:38.170> back<00:01:38.380> on<00:01:38.619> other<00:01:39.160> models

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:39.640 
button to turn it back on other models

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.090 
button to turn it back on other models
will<00:01:39.820> reboot<00:01:40.180> automatically<00:01:40.869> but<00:01:41.650> not<00:01:41.890> the

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100 
will reboot automatically but not the

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.070 
will reboot automatically but not the
map<00:01:42.280> 62<00:01:42.820> so<00:01:43.090> we're<00:01:43.300> going<00:01:43.420> to<00:01:43.479> go<00:01:43.570> through<00:01:43.840> the

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:44.080 
map 62 so we're going to go through the

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:46.350 
map 62 so we're going to go through the
blue<00:01:44.229> top<00:01:44.380> cycle<00:01:44.890> here<00:01:45.159> and<00:01:45.340> the<00:01:45.850> next<00:01:46.060> screen

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:46.360 
blue top cycle here and the next screen

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.780 
blue top cycle here and the next screen
that<00:01:46.390> will<00:01:46.690> see<00:01:46.960> is<00:01:47.200> the<00:01:47.560> validation<00:01:48.100> of<00:01:48.580> the

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:48.790 
that will see is the validation of the

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:51.180 
that will see is the validation of the
firmware<00:01:49.259> so<00:01:50.259> that's<00:01:50.500> going<00:01:50.680> to<00:01:50.740> take<00:01:50.920> about<00:01:51.070> a

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:51.190 
firmware so that's going to take about a

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:53.790 
firmware so that's going to take about a
minute<00:01:51.520> or<00:01:51.790> so<00:01:52.000> maybe<00:01:52.240> a<00:01:52.390> little<00:01:52.600> bit<00:01:52.720> less<00:01:52.930> it

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:53.800 
minute or so maybe a little bit less it

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:59.389 
minute or so maybe a little bit less it
will<00:01:53.920> count<00:01:54.100> to<00:01:54.340> from<00:01:54.610> zero<00:01:54.880> to<00:01:54.970> 100%

00:01:59.389 --> 00:01:59.399 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:01.680 

once<00:02:00.399> it's<00:02:00.520> done<00:02:00.700> is<00:02:00.820> gonna<00:02:00.970> restart<00:02:01.450> it's

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:01.690 
once it's done is gonna restart it's

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:04.830 
once it's done is gonna restart it's
gonna<00:02:01.780> apply<00:02:02.170> or<00:02:02.530> load<00:02:02.830> the<00:02:03.039> loader<00:02:03.280> and<00:02:03.840> for

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:04.840 
gonna apply or load the loader and for

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.300 
gonna apply or load the loader and for
those<00:02:04.960> who've<00:02:05.259> updated<00:02:05.950> their<00:02:06.070> firmware

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.310 
those who've updated their firmware

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:08.880 
those who've updated their firmware
before<00:02:06.670> you'll<00:02:07.240> see<00:02:07.479> a<00:02:07.509> familiar<00:02:07.929> screen<00:02:08.380> here

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:08.890 
before you'll see a familiar screen here

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:10.859 
before you'll see a familiar screen here
so<00:02:09.039> this<00:02:09.459> is<00:02:09.640> what<00:02:09.820> takes<00:02:10.090> the<00:02:10.330> longest<00:02:10.660> years

00:02:10.859 --> 00:02:10.869 
so this is what takes the longest years

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:12.870 
so this is what takes the longest years
to<00:02:11.110> apply<00:02:11.380> to<00:02:11.440> firmware<00:02:11.920> you<00:02:12.550> see<00:02:12.730> the

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
to apply to firmware you see the

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.699 
to apply to firmware you see the
progress<00:02:13.090> bar<00:02:13.510> here<00:02:13.540> it's<00:02:14.170> pretty<00:02:14.440> short

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
progress bar here it's pretty short

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:16.860 
progress bar here it's pretty short
update<00:02:15.640> here<00:02:16.000> so<00:02:16.150> it<00:02:16.209> goes<00:02:16.330> by<00:02:16.510> pretty<00:02:16.540> fast

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
update here so it goes by pretty fast

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.979 
update here so it goes by pretty fast
and<00:02:17.650> we'll<00:02:17.860> do<00:02:17.980> a<00:02:18.010> final<00:02:18.310> reboot<00:02:19.180> and<00:02:19.510> we

00:02:19.979 --> 00:02:19.989 
and we'll do a final reboot and we

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:21.870 
and we'll do a final reboot and we
should<00:02:20.200> be<00:02:20.350> presented<00:02:20.860> to<00:02:21.220> our<00:02:21.459> regular

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 
should be presented to our regular

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.300 
should be presented to our regular
startup<00:02:22.360> screen<00:02:22.690> or<00:02:23.050> whatever<00:02:23.830> screen<00:02:24.100> that

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:24.310 
startup screen or whatever screen that

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.009 
startup screen or whatever screen that
we're<00:02:24.430> at<00:02:24.700> the<00:02:24.910> last<00:02:25.120> time<00:02:25.390> so<00:02:25.690> this<00:02:25.840> might

00:02:26.009 --> 00:02:26.019 
we're at the last time so this might

00:02:26.019 --> 00:02:27.870 
we're at the last time so this might
take<00:02:26.049> a<00:02:26.500> little<00:02:26.890> while<00:02:27.130> depending<00:02:27.400> if<00:02:27.790> you

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:27.880 
take a little while depending if you

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:42.410 
take a little while depending if you
have<00:02:28.030> custom<00:02:28.480> maps<00:02:28.690> installed<00:02:29.200> or<00:02:29.350> not

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.150 

there<00:02:42.599> we<00:02:42.720> go<00:02:42.840> here's<00:02:43.170> our<00:02:43.290> map<00:02:43.500> screen<00:02:43.740> we<00:02:44.010> did

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
there we go here's our map screen we did

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.559 
there we go here's our map screen we did
a<00:02:44.190> little<00:02:44.370> track<00:02:44.640> a<00:02:44.880> little<00:02:45.090> hike<00:02:45.240> here

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:45.569 
a little track a little hike here

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:48.740 
a little track a little hike here
everything<00:02:46.440> looks<00:02:46.650> okay<00:02:47.459> so<00:02:48.360> there<00:02:48.510> you<00:02:48.540> go

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
everything looks okay so there you go

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:53.870 
everything looks okay so there you go
that<00:02:49.470> is<00:02:49.770> how<00:02:50.190> you<00:02:50.250> update<00:02:51.000> firmware
