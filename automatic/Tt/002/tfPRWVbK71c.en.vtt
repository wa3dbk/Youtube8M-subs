00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:15.650
 hello everyone with you fil and i'm writing 

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:18.170
 my second video blog which I would like to 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:21.380
 share about how we spent our 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:23.510
 great bootcamp this bootcamp 

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.439
 probably one of the best ones i 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:26.570
 I can remember 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:28.460
 we played really cool a lot 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:31.130
 trained and almost did not quarrel 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:33.380
 and every day I saw the whole team 

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:37.100
 and including I recruit a good game 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:40.730
 form probably you know that we take off 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:44.030
 to the vein tournament already literally tomorrow it 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:46.190
 it will be friday in the afternoon but we will be in Vienna and where 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:48.290
 a little rest and on Saturday we will be 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:52.040
 play tournaments and fight the best 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:54.260
 Worldwide teams vx goal all 

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:57.490
 probably already saw our group which 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:01:01.100
 consists of Polish Germans and British 

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:03.710
 Poles are a great team there is gaming 

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:06.170
 which literally won all you can 

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.210
 in counter strike 1 6 and the rule is already 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:11.320
 several lans 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:14.570
 counter-strike go and the last lan was 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:18.020
 win last season starserii 

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:20.390
 about the team not faculty i say nothing 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:22.250
 I can not special though I know of course 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.140
 what are those guys you are playing 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.820
 win almost all 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.770
 the internet and they are 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:30.260
 one of two teams that beat 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:34.070
 there are no great ones but of course this is all 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:37.190
 was played on the internet by team number 

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:41.810
 3 in our group is 

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:44.570
 english earrings or crg these guys and 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:47.420
 know absolutely nothing at all 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:49.610
 the only thing is that toilets and for sure 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:52.280
 they also play well because 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:55.190
 sovs teams head almost immediately 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:57.380
 It turned out to play well as it is 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:00.490
 a certain similarity to the dynamics of the game and 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.490
 similarity cards 

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:04.780
 the only problem i can 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:08.840
 note at the moment this is 

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:10.700
 no vis next season 

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:12.590
 namely some problems with 

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.110
 invitations although of course we think 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:17.420
 decide them if we have a passport 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.130
 still valid visa to germany 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:22.790
 and she will allow us to still visit 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:25.550
 this tournament at any cost though she 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:29.600
 will not allow us to visit this tournament 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:31.430
 the cowboy manager and this guy maybe 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.860
 will be rooting for us though literally 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:37.580
 very soon you will find out will be with us or 

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:39.200
 No, I can also say yesterday 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:42.200
 updated his counter 

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:44.930
 or today and 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:47.930
 they fixed the magic lacquer improved 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:52.130
 damage not to match 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:54.800
 improved the spread of digula and further 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:57.650
 fixed that stories on one side 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:59.870
 the fact that they fixed the block and reduced 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:02.060
 water mouse is good 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:04.550
 news but I can highlight the fact that 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:06.020
 such objects before the tournament or in 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:08.690
 tournament time will not affect 

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:12.050
 good at playing all the teams and will contribute 

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:14.230
 some imbalance or luck factor 

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:18.260
 so I would advise for the future 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:20.540
 look at the developers on the schedule 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.700
 tournaments and basically make changes 

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:25.340
 the game especially amounts such as 

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:28.430
 change shooting after all make them 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:30.650
 not during tournaments but in between seasons 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:33.739
 so to speak for example in April or in May 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:35.630
 i don't know no major tournaments 

00:03:33.739 --> 00:03:37.989
 Therefore , it is planned that it is exactly that 

00:03:35.630 --> 00:03:40.959
 time when they could do 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:44.630
 significant changes in the balance of the game 

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:46.930
 also for sure you know what was 

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:49.610
 Moscow tournament announced at the end of March 

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:51.530
 it will be techlabs cup this tournament 

00:03:49.610 --> 00:03:55.070
 will bring together the best teams of Ukraine 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:57.680
 Russia is also no great Swedes therefore 

00:03:55.070 --> 00:04:00.560
 we can say from ourselves that we are waiting for everyone 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:03.290
 necessarily in Khimki Moscow at the end 

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:05.780
 March this will be a grand event and 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:08.209
 for sure those guys who were past 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:09.890
 year was in Moscow at the same time 

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:12.930
 Khimki 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:16.250
 will confirm it all spent enough 

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:18.630
 nice weekend and everyone enjoyed it 

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:20.760
 next tournament after techlabs 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:24.060

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:26.610
 games in denmark it will already be exfat our 

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:29.010

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:31.280
 will show if na'vi can 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:32.810
 count on medals in this version 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:35.699
 so 

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:39.150

00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:41.900
