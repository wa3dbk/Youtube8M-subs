00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:30.979 
say they're not great if you've got

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:33.010

really big feet I have pretty small feet

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:22.840 
and it was a good thing I did because it

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:27.479 
and it was a good thing I did because it
was<00:02:23.430> freezing<00:02:24.430> inside<00:02:25.079> the<00:02:26.079> restaurant<00:02:26.489> so

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:39.580 
lightweight so it's terrific if it's

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:42.029

it has that separation or that seam in
the<00:06:44.560> middle<00:06:44.889> so<00:06:45.399> it<00:06:45.490> really<00:06:45.729> does<00:06:46.029> create<00:06:46.389> some

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:46.690 
the middle so it really does create some

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:47.290 
the middle so it really does create some
shapes

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:47.300
