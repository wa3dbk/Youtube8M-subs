wash on a watercolor paper or raw canvas

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:25.759 
wash on a watercolor paper or raw canvas
it<00:00:23.619> has<00:00:24.070> to<00:00:24.250> be<00:00:24.279> a<00:00:24.400> surface<00:00:24.880> that<00:00:24.910> can<00:00:25.119> absorb

00:00:25.759 --> 00:00:25.769 
it has to be a surface that can absorb

it has to be a surface that can absorb
what<00:00:26.769> we<00:00:26.890> want<00:00:27.070> to<00:00:27.160> do<00:00:27.310> is<00:00:27.550> make<00:00:27.880> a<00:00:28.210> mixture<00:00:28.779> and

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:29.080 
what we want to do is make a mixture and

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:31.499 
what we want to do is make a mixture and
I've<00:00:29.470> already<00:00:29.679> pre-done<00:00:30.189> that<00:00:30.460> you<00:00:30.939> use<00:00:31.150> five

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:31.509 
I've already pre-done that you use five

00:00:31.509 --> 00:00:33.840 
I've already pre-done that you use five
to<00:00:31.779> ten<00:00:32.020> percent<00:00:32.470> of<00:00:32.619> the<00:00:33.160> surface<00:00:33.670> tension

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:33.850 
to ten percent of the surface tension

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:36.390 
to ten percent of the surface tension
breaker<00:00:34.210> to<00:00:34.960> water<00:00:35.230> ninety<00:00:35.860> percent<00:00:35.980> water

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:39.460 
ten percent surface tension breaker now

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.300 
ten percent surface tension breaker now
I'm<00:00:39.520> going<00:00:39.670> to<00:00:39.730> go<00:00:39.820> and<00:00:39.940> spray<00:00:40.210> this<00:00:40.480> area<00:00:41.350> get

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:42.310 
I'm going to go and spray this area get

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:45.330 
I'm going to go and spray this area get
a<00:00:42.340> little<00:00:42.610> wash<00:00:43.120> down<00:00:43.480> of<00:00:43.690> it<00:00:43.870> and<00:00:44.340> pretreat

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:45.340 
a little wash down of it and pretreat

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:49.830 
a little wash down of it and pretreat
the<00:00:45.370> paper<00:00:45.790> with<00:00:46.090> this<00:00:46.360> okay<00:00:48.540> let's<00:00:49.540> see<00:00:49.690> what

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:49.840 
the paper with this okay let's see what

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:51.180 
the paper with this okay let's see what
we<00:00:49.930> got<00:00:50.110> I'll<00:00:50.290> do<00:00:50.410> a<00:00:50.440> little<00:00:50.680> bit<00:00:50.860> with<00:00:51.040> this

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:51.190 
we got I'll do a little bit with this

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:56.490 
we got I'll do a little bit with this
one<00:00:52.920> work<00:00:53.920> it<00:00:54.130> in<00:00:55.050> it's<00:00:56.050> just<00:00:56.260> going<00:00:56.380> to<00:00:56.410> be

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:56.500 
one work it in it's just going to be

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.850 
one work it in it's just going to be
able<00:00:56.770> to<00:00:56.890> let<00:00:57.160> that<00:00:57.400> color<00:00:58.000> fall<00:00:58.660> in<00:00:59.050> place<00:00:59.410> so

00:00:59.850 --> 00:00:59.860 
able to let that color fall in place so

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:04.229 
able to let that color fall in place so
much<00:01:00.070> easier<00:01:01.740> to<00:01:02.740> create<00:01:03.010> a<00:01:03.100> beautiful<00:01:03.610> even

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:04.239 
much easier to create a beautiful even

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:07.410 
much easier to create a beautiful even
field<00:01:04.650> now<00:01:05.650> you<00:01:05.680> see<00:01:05.830> that<00:01:06.310> when<00:01:06.970> I<00:01:07.000> stroke<00:01:07.390> it

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:07.420 
field now you see that when I stroke it

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.420 
field now you see that when I stroke it
if<00:01:07.659> I<00:01:07.810> really<00:01:08.110> agitate<00:01:08.680> it<00:01:08.710> I<00:01:08.890> can<00:01:09.130> create

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:09.430 
if I really agitate it I can create

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:12.780 
if I really agitate it I can create
bubbles<00:01:09.670> you<00:01:10.240> don't<00:01:10.450> want<00:01:10.750> that<00:01:11.220> so<00:01:12.220> you<00:01:12.580> give

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:12.790 
bubbles you don't want that so you give

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:17.010 
bubbles you don't want that so you give
it<00:01:12.910> a<00:01:12.970> nice<00:01:13.270> relaxed<00:01:14.050> stroke<00:01:14.380> and<00:01:15.660> that<00:01:16.660> allows

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:17.020 
it a nice relaxed stroke and that allows

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.149 
it a nice relaxed stroke and that allows
that<00:01:17.380> paper<00:01:17.740> to<00:01:18.010> get<00:01:18.160> set<00:01:18.460> up<00:01:19.890> now<00:01:20.890> what<00:01:20.920> I'm

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:21.159 
that paper to get set up now what I'm

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:23.430 
that paper to get set up now what I'm
going<00:01:21.280> to<00:01:21.340> do<00:01:21.490> is<00:01:21.850> let<00:01:22.600> me<00:01:22.720> take<00:01:22.870> another<00:01:22.900> brush

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:23.440 
going to do is let me take another brush

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.880 
going to do is let me take another brush
and<00:01:23.740> just<00:01:23.950> use<00:01:24.130> plain<00:01:24.250> water<00:01:24.550> here<00:01:25.680> i'm<00:01:26.680> using

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:26.890 
and just use plain water here i'm using

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:29.370 
and just use plain water here i'm using
a<00:01:27.310> flow<00:01:27.580> formula<00:01:27.940> and<00:01:28.330> again<00:01:28.570> the<00:01:28.720> flow<00:01:28.960> for<00:01:29.230> me

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:29.380 
a flow formula and again the flow for me

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.080 
a flow formula and again the flow for me
is<00:01:29.500> probably<00:01:29.710> best<00:01:30.130> suited<00:01:30.250> for<00:01:30.580> doing<00:01:30.970> these

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.090 
is probably best suited for doing these

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.510 
is probably best suited for doing these
watches<00:01:31.690> the<00:01:32.320> structure<00:01:32.890> formula<00:01:33.340> is<00:01:33.460> going

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:33.520 
watches the structure formula is going

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:35.460 
watches the structure formula is going
to<00:01:33.610> be<00:01:33.760> more<00:01:34.030> for<00:01:34.420> if<00:01:34.540> I'm<00:01:34.690> were<00:01:34.810> using<00:01:35.110> impasse

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:35.470 
to be more for if I'm were using impasse

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:37.950 
to be more for if I'm were using impasse
toes<00:01:35.800> or<00:01:36.010> a<00:01:36.040> bulk<00:01:36.370> painting<00:01:36.909> this<00:01:37.630> is<00:01:37.750> going<00:01:37.900> to

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:37.960 
toes or a bulk painting this is going to

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:40.200 
toes or a bulk painting this is going to
be<00:01:38.080> actually<00:01:38.260> acrylic<00:01:39.010> wash<00:01:39.220> that's<00:01:39.970> going<00:01:40.150> to

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:40.210 
be actually acrylic wash that's going to

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:41.910 
be actually acrylic wash that's going to
actually<00:01:40.360> have<00:01:40.870> the<00:01:41.020> same<00:01:41.229> qualities<00:01:41.740> as<00:01:41.770> a

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:41.920 
actually have the same qualities as a

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.750 
actually have the same qualities as a
watercolor<00:01:43.830> so<00:01:44.830> I'm<00:01:45.100> just<00:01:45.370> going<00:01:45.520> to<00:01:45.610> take

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:45.760 
watercolor so I'm just going to take

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.570 
watercolor so I'm just going to take
this<00:01:46.050> using<00:01:47.050> water<00:01:47.290> to<00:01:47.590> create<00:01:48.040> this<00:01:48.310> wash

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:48.580 
this using water to create this wash

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:50.550 
this using water to create this wash
over<00:01:48.970> here<00:01:49.270> and<00:01:49.600> you<00:01:49.960> see<00:01:50.110> I<00:01:50.140> get<00:01:50.409> this

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:50.560 
over here and you see I get this

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:57.630 
over here and you see I get this
streakiness<00:01:51.040> okay<00:01:51.820> I<00:01:55.860> want<00:01:56.860> to<00:01:56.920> have<00:01:57.040> an<00:01:57.159> even

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:57.640 
streakiness okay I want to have an even

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:01.500 
streakiness okay I want to have an even
field<00:01:57.909> of<00:01:58.150> color<00:01:59.520> because<00:02:00.520> I<00:02:00.670> pretreated<00:02:01.330> this

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:01.510 
field of color because I pretreated this

00:02:01.510 --> 00:02:06.990 
field of color because I pretreated this
area<00:02:01.930> over<00:02:02.260> here<00:02:04.320> work<00:02:05.320> it<00:02:05.500> in<00:02:05.680> now<00:02:06.430> take<00:02:06.790> some

00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:21.080 

if<00:02:18.990> I<00:02:19.320> want<00:02:19.500> to<00:02:19.530> add<00:02:19.680> a<00:02:19.710> little<00:02:19.800> bit<00:02:20.070> more<00:02:20.310> I<00:02:20.550> can

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
if I want to add a little bit more I can

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.160 
if I want to add a little bit more I can
get<00:02:21.210> some<00:02:21.390> very<00:02:21.600> interesting<00:02:21.990> effects<00:02:22.770> here

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.170 
get some very interesting effects here

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.770 
get some very interesting effects here
but<00:02:25.170> it<00:02:25.260> just<00:02:25.290> evens<00:02:26.100> out<00:02:26.280> a<00:02:26.490> beautiful<00:02:27.150> like

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:27.780 
but it just evens out a beautiful like

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.690 
but it just evens out a beautiful like
if<00:02:27.930> you<00:02:28.050> wanted<00:02:28.290> to<00:02:28.380> do<00:02:28.530> this<00:02:28.700> beautiful

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:29.700 
if you wanted to do this beautiful

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.720 
if you wanted to do this beautiful
sunset<00:02:30.680> you<00:02:31.680> get<00:02:31.860> in<00:02:31.950> the<00:02:32.010> same<00:02:32.310> kind<00:02:32.670> of

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
sunset you get in the same kind of

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:35.240 
sunset you get in the same kind of
watercolor<00:02:33.330> techniques<00:02:33.870> and<00:02:34.250> you're

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:35.250 
watercolor techniques and you're

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.070 
watercolor techniques and you're
eliminating<00:02:35.820> that<00:02:35.910> splashing<00:02:36.480> yes<00:02:36.840> it

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
eliminating that splashing yes it

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:42.050 
eliminating that splashing yes it
reduces<00:02:37.590> the<00:02:37.830> chroma<00:02:38.460> of<00:02:38.790> the<00:02:39.720> color<00:02:41.060> but

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
reduces the chroma of the color but

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.820 
reduces the chroma of the color but
you're<00:02:42.210> getting<00:02:42.300> that<00:02:42.510> watercolor<00:02:43.350> kind<00:02:43.710> of

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:43.830 
you're getting that watercolor kind of

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:47.420 
you're getting that watercolor kind of
effect<00:02:44.190> here<00:02:44.520> instead<00:02:45.090> of<00:02:45.150> that<00:02:46.190> straight<00:02:47.190> on

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
effect here instead of that straight on

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:48.920 
effect here instead of that straight on
brain<00:02:48.030> so<00:02:48.300> it's<00:02:48.450> just<00:02:48.510> giving<00:02:48.810> you<00:02:48.870> a

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
brain so it's just giving you a

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.100 
brain so it's just giving you a
watercolor<00:02:49.530> effect<00:02:49.760> with<00:02:50.760> an<00:02:50.880> acrylic<00:02:51.090> so<00:02:51.600> you

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
watercolor effect with an acrylic so you

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.140 
watercolor effect with an acrylic so you
watercolorists<00:02:52.980> who've<00:02:53.430> never<00:02:53.580> tried

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150

snowflake it's sort of like I've seen

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:19.610 
snowflake it's sort of like I've seen
this<00:03:18.540> technique<00:03:18.780> before<00:03:18.990> when<00:03:19.500> they've

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:19.620 
this technique before when they've

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:23.930 
this technique before when they've
actually<00:03:19.890> added<00:03:20.130> some<00:03:20.580> alcohol<00:03:21.240> to<00:03:21.450> it<00:03:22.940> but

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940 
actually added some alcohol to it but

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:27.890 
actually added some alcohol to it but
i'll<00:03:24.090> just<00:03:24.590> take<00:03:25.590> a<00:03:25.650> brush<00:03:26.010> and<00:03:26.360> slightly<00:03:27.360> pull

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:27.900 
i'll just take a brush and slightly pull
