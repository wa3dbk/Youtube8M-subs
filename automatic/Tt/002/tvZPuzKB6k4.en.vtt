00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:11.810 
hit to this side turn the shoulders get

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:13.690 
hit to this side turn the shoulders get
the<00:01:11.930> racquet<00:01:12.259> back<00:01:12.439> because<00:01:13.100> remember<00:01:13.430> you've

the racquet back because remember you've

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:16.030 
the racquet back because remember you've
got<00:01:13.880> to<00:01:14.030> hit<00:01:14.149> it<00:01:14.210> further<00:01:14.960> in<00:01:15.290> front<00:01:15.680> now<00:01:15.860> at

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:16.040 
got to hit it further in front now at

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.850

least a foot to a foot and a half ok

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.880 
least a foot to a foot and a half ok
another<00:01:19.189> reason<00:01:19.850> that<00:01:20.390> early<00:01:20.990> preparation<00:01:21.740> is

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890 
another reason that early preparation is

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.219 
another reason that early preparation is
so<00:01:22.100> important<00:01:22.700> is<00:01:23.030> because<00:01:23.090> if<00:01:23.539> you<00:01:23.719> if<00:01:23.990> you're

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:24.229 
so important is because if you if you're

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:26.709 
so important is because if you if you're
late<00:01:24.469> getting<00:01:24.799> the<00:01:24.890> racquet<00:01:25.250> back<00:01:25.539> you're<00:01:26.539> not

00:01:26.709 --> 00:01:26.719 
late getting the racquet back you're not

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:28.480 
late getting the racquet back you're not
going<00:01:26.899> to<00:01:26.960> have<00:01:27.110> time<00:01:27.439> to<00:01:27.680> drop<00:01:27.890> the<00:01:27.950> racket

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
going to have time to drop the racket

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.940 
going to have time to drop the racket
down<00:01:28.759> and<00:01:29.090> what<00:01:29.539> happens<00:01:29.960> is<00:01:30.110> you'll<00:01:30.320> swing<00:01:30.680> to

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
down and what happens is you'll swing to

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:33.399 
down and what happens is you'll swing to
horizontally<00:01:31.729> remember<00:01:32.570> even<00:01:32.930> from<00:01:33.140> near<00:01:33.380> the

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:33.409 
horizontally remember even from near the

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:36.429 
horizontally remember even from near the
baseline<00:01:34.039> here<00:01:34.399> if<00:01:34.820> I'm<00:01:35.570> hitting<00:01:35.899> a<00:01:35.990> shoulder

baseline here if I'm hitting a shoulder
high<00:01:36.590> ball<00:01:36.890> now<00:01:37.460> this<00:01:37.640> is<00:01:37.789> obviously<00:01:38.240> higher

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:38.600 
high ball now this is obviously higher

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.020 
high ball now this is obviously higher
than<00:01:38.899> the<00:01:39.020> net<00:01:39.229> but<00:01:39.920> when<00:01:40.070> you<00:01:40.189> swing<00:01:40.549> straight

what happens see the ball is going to go

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:48.819 
what happens see the ball is going to go
right<00:01:46.729> in<00:01:46.909> the<00:01:46.939> net<00:01:47.240> you'd<00:01:48.109> have<00:01:48.350> to<00:01:48.500> hit<00:01:48.649> the

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:11.300 
so once you get to here remember you're

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.180
