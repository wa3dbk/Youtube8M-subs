right but you have to be able to look
ahead<00:00:56.469> you<00:00:56.829> have<00:00:56.890> to<00:00:57.070> sort<00:00:57.280> of<00:00:57.370> plan<00:00:58.000> your

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:58.210 
ahead you have to sort of plan your

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:01.290 
ahead you have to sort of plan your
moves<00:00:58.420> and<00:00:58.719> carefully<00:00:59.230> it<00:00:59.649> takes<00:00:59.859> a<00:01:00.300> strategy

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:01.300

what<00:01:19.720> can<00:01:19.869> we<00:01:19.990> do<00:01:20.290> with<00:01:21.009> halo<00:01:21.430> that<00:01:21.579> has<00:01:21.759> not

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:21.909 
what can we do with halo that has not

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:25.080 
what can we do with halo that has not

and<00:01:28.090> now<00:01:29.090> what<00:01:29.390> we're<00:01:29.570> doing<00:01:29.600> is<00:01:30.039> for<00:01:31.039> a<00:01:31.100> brain

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:31.310
