00:00:02.389 --> 00:00:04.789 

okay<00:00:03.389> so<00:00:03.449> there<00:00:03.750> are<00:00:03.780> two<00:00:03.840> scales<00:00:04.259> to<00:00:04.500> look<00:00:04.650> at

00:00:04.789 --> 00:00:04.799 
okay so there are two scales to look at

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:07.450 
okay so there are two scales to look at
on<00:00:05.069> a<00:00:05.130> micrometer<00:00:05.910> the<00:00:06.390> barrel<00:00:06.690> scale<00:00:06.990> and

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:07.460 
on a micrometer the barrel scale and

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:10.339 
on a micrometer the barrel scale and
thimble<00:00:08.460> scale<00:00:08.809> we'll<00:00:09.809> look<00:00:09.900> at<00:00:10.019> the<00:00:10.080> barrel

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
thimble scale we'll look at the barrel

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:16.880 
thimble scale we'll look at the barrel
scale<00:00:10.620> first<00:00:10.889> so<00:00:15.020> so<00:00:16.020> here's<00:00:16.230> a<00:00:16.289> barrel<00:00:16.590> scale

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
scale first so so here's a barrel scale

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.140 
scale first so so here's a barrel scale
up<00:00:17.160> close<00:00:18.650> you'll<00:00:19.650> notice<00:00:19.949> that<00:00:20.130> it's<00:00:20.369> got

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150 
up close you'll notice that it's got

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.259 
up close you'll notice that it's got
some<00:00:21.390> numbers<00:00:21.720> across<00:00:22.320> here<00:00:22.590> and<00:00:22.830> some<00:00:23.760> tick

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
some numbers across here and some tick

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.900 
some numbers across here and some tick
marks<00:00:24.660> now<00:00:25.350> if<00:00:25.740> an<00:00:26.160> inch<00:00:26.279> micrometer<00:00:26.699> is

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
marks now if an inch micrometer is

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.689 
marks now if an inch micrometer is
reading<00:00:27.269> from<00:00:27.510> say<00:00:27.750> zero<00:00:28.109> to<00:00:28.199> one<00:00:28.590> inch<00:00:28.890> then

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
reading from say zero to one inch then

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.400 
reading from say zero to one inch then
this<00:00:30.689> scale<00:00:31.160> is<00:00:32.450> well<00:00:33.450> they're<00:00:33.630> tenths<00:00:34.110> of<00:00:34.290> an

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:34.410 
this scale is well they're tenths of an

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.740 
this scale is well they're tenths of an
inch<00:00:34.559> but<00:00:34.890> this<00:00:35.040> would<00:00:35.190> be<00:00:35.309> a<00:00:35.520> half<00:00:36.149> an<00:00:36.360> inch<00:00:36.480> so

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
inch but this would be a half an inch so

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:45.100 
inch but this would be a half an inch so
that's<00:00:36.980> 0.5<00:00:37.980> or<00:00:38.280> 0.5<00:00:39.030> 0<00:00:39.450> 0<00:00:40.850> this<00:00:41.850> first<00:00:43.670> main

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:45.110 
that's 0.5 or 0.5 0 0 this first main

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:47.240 
that's 0.5 or 0.5 0 0 this first main
graduation<00:00:46.110> here<00:00:46.260> the<00:00:46.350> first<00:00:46.530> big<00:00:46.770> division

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
graduation here the first big division

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.160 
graduation here the first big division
from<00:00:47.910> 0<00:00:48.180> to<00:00:48.270> 1<00:00:48.660> this<00:00:49.530> is<00:00:50.210> 0.1<00:00:51.210> so<00:00:51.840> that's<00:00:52.050> a

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
from 0 to 1 this is 0.1 so that's a

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:54.590 
from 0 to 1 this is 0.1 so that's a
tenth<00:00:52.469> of<00:00:52.559> an<00:00:52.680> inch<00:00:52.800> or<00:00:53.039> if<00:00:53.460> we're<00:00:54.120> thinking<00:00:54.449> in

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
tenth of an inch or if we're thinking in

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.459 
tenth of an inch or if we're thinking in
thousands<00:00:55.110> of<00:00:55.199> an<00:00:55.289> inch<00:00:55.440> that's<00:00:55.680> a<00:00:55.860> hundred

00:00:57.459 --> 00:00:57.469 
thousands of an inch that's a hundred

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:02.510 
thousands of an inch that's a hundred
the<00:00:58.469> next<00:00:58.710> big<00:00:59.160> mark<00:00:59.430> is<00:01:00.329> 200<00:01:00.960> or<00:01:01.050> 0.2<00:01:01.890> so<00:01:02.219> point

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
the next big mark is 200 or 0.2 so point

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.509 
the next big mark is 200 or 0.2 so point
to<00:01:02.820> 0<00:01:03.090> 0<00:01:03.420> will<00:01:04.019> say<00:01:04.229> that<00:01:04.439> is<00:01:04.559> 200<00:01:05.309> and<00:01:05.400> that

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:05.519 
to 0 0 will say that is 200 and that

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.100 
to 0 0 will say that is 200 and that
will<00:01:05.729> make<00:01:05.909> it<00:01:06.090> easy<00:01:06.360> to<00:01:06.479> keep<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.780> decimal

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:07.110 
will make it easy to keep the decimal

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.910 
will make it easy to keep the decimal
place<00:01:07.290> straight<00:01:08.720> down<00:01:09.720> here<00:01:10.049> that's<00:01:10.560> a<00:01:10.740> half

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
place straight down here that's a half

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:17.270 
place straight down here that's a half
an<00:01:11.100> inch<00:01:11.220> point<00:01:11.850> five<00:01:14.299> now<00:01:15.299> if<00:01:15.570> if<00:01:16.500> this<00:01:17.009> first

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
an inch point five now if if this first

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.200 
an inch point five now if if this first
mark<00:01:17.580> is<00:01:17.729> point<00:01:18.090> 1<00:01:18.390> or<00:01:19.070> 100<00:01:20.070> half<00:01:20.729> of<00:01:20.970> that

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
mark is point 1 or 100 half of that

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:26.359 
mark is point 1 or 100 half of that
would<00:01:21.840> be<00:01:22.460> 50<00:01:23.960> 0.05<00:01:24.960> oh<00:01:24.990> so<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:26.159> halfway

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
would be 50 0.05 oh so the halfway

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:32.719 
would be 50 0.05 oh so the halfway
between<00:01:27.290> 0<00:01:28.290> and<00:01:28.619> point<00:01:29.040> 1<00:01:29.280> is<00:01:30.229> 50<00:01:31.229> or<00:01:31.729> 50

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
between 0 and point 1 is 50 or 50

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:35.590 
between 0 and point 1 is 50 or 50
thousandths

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.980 

half<00:01:36.290> of<00:01:36.500> that<00:01:36.530> distance<00:01:37.270> would<00:01:38.270> be<00:01:38.330> a<00:01:38.479> quarter

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:38.990 
half of that distance would be a quarter

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.500 
half of that distance would be a quarter
so<00:01:39.650> if<00:01:39.979> you're<00:01:40.580> thinking<00:01:40.909> in<00:01:41.030> terms<00:01:41.060> of

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:41.510 
so if you're thinking in terms of

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:43.800 
so if you're thinking in terms of
thousands<00:01:42.290> this<00:01:42.830> would<00:01:43.010> be<00:01:43.130> a<00:01:43.159> hundred

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:43.810 
thousands this would be a hundred

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:47.940 
thousands this would be a hundred
twenty-five<00:01:44.810> fifty<00:01:45.440> and<00:01:45.950> then<00:01:46.729> this<00:01:47.420> mark

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
twenty-five fifty and then this mark

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:51.100 
twenty-five fifty and then this mark
would<00:01:48.950> obviously<00:01:49.250> be<00:01:49.430> seventy<00:01:50.270> five<00:01:50.540> point

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110 
would obviously be seventy five point

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:56.020 
would obviously be seventy five point
zero<00:01:51.229> seven<00:01:51.770> five<00:01:53.830> the<00:01:54.830> main<00:01:55.009> scale<00:01:55.340> if<00:01:55.580> we

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
zero seven five the main scale if we

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.630 
zero seven five the main scale if we
want<00:01:56.330> to<00:01:56.360> read<00:01:56.509> these<00:01:56.660> together<00:01:56.920> this<00:01:57.920> 0.1

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
want to read these together this 0.1

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.370 
want to read these together this 0.1
somewhere<00:01:59.540> out<00:01:59.690> here<00:01:59.720> this<00:02:00.140> will<00:02:00.259> be<00:02:00.440> 0.4<00:02:01.400> or

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:02.380 
somewhere out here this will be 0.4 or

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.440 
somewhere out here this will be 0.4 or
four<00:02:03.380> hundred<00:02:03.500> and<00:02:03.770> twenty<00:02:03.830> five<00:02:04.180> point<00:02:05.180> four

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:05.450 
four hundred and twenty five point four

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.310 
four hundred and twenty five point four
two<00:02:05.720> five<00:02:07.420> down<00:02:08.420> here<00:02:08.750> can<00:02:08.899> you<00:02:08.989> guess<00:02:09.140> what

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:09.320 
two five down here can you guess what

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:11.670 
two five down here can you guess what
this<00:02:09.470> would<00:02:09.619> be<00:02:09.649> this<00:02:09.860> would<00:02:09.920> be<00:02:10.130> point<00:02:10.880> six

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680 
this would be this would be point six

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.440 
this would be this would be point six
seven<00:02:12.680> five<00:02:13.070> or<00:02:13.370> six<00:02:13.730> hundred<00:02:13.820> and<00:02:14.120> seventy

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
seven five or six hundred and seventy

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:19.420 
seven five or six hundred and seventy
five<00:02:14.950> thousands<00:02:16.959> now<00:02:18.020> the<00:02:18.350> other<00:02:18.530> scale<00:02:19.250> is

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
five thousands now the other scale is

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.270 
five thousands now the other scale is
the<00:02:19.459> thimble<00:02:19.820> scale<00:02:20.239> and<00:02:20.860> you'll<00:02:21.860> see<00:02:22.010> that<00:02:22.160> it

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:22.280 
the thimble scale and you'll see that it

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.400 
the thimble scale and you'll see that it
starts<00:02:22.520> at<00:02:22.760> zero<00:02:23.030> and<00:02:23.239> goes<00:02:23.450> from<00:02:23.900> one<00:02:24.110> two

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:24.410 
starts at zero and goes from one two

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.820 
starts at zero and goes from one two
three<00:02:24.739> four<00:02:25.040> all<00:02:25.459> the<00:02:25.730> way<00:02:25.790> around<00:02:26.150> to<00:02:26.540> 20<00:02:27.530> 21

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:27.830 
three four all the way around to 20 21

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:33.960 
three four all the way around to 20 21
22<00:02:28.220> 23<00:02:28.370> 24<00:02:28.970> and<00:02:29.780> this<00:02:30.320> would<00:02:30.500> be<00:02:30.590> the<00:02:30.709> 25th<00:02:32.080> so

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
22 23 24 and this would be the 25th so

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:38.110 
22 23 24 and this would be the 25th so
these<00:02:34.970> are<00:02:35.530> thousands<00:02:36.530> of<00:02:36.620> an<00:02:36.709> inch<00:02:37.030> so<00:02:38.030> if

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
these are thousands of an inch so if

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.150 
these are thousands of an inch so if
this<00:02:38.239> says<00:02:38.480> one<00:02:38.840> this<00:02:39.140> is<00:02:39.320> one<00:02:39.560> thousandth

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
this says one this is one thousandth

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.949 
this says one this is one thousandth
point<00:02:40.580> zero<00:02:40.850> zero<00:02:40.880> one<00:02:41.380> five<00:02:43.450> would<00:02:44.450> be<00:02:44.630> point

00:02:44.949 --> 00:02:44.959 
point zero zero one five would be point

00:02:44.959 --> 00:02:51.310 
point zero zero one five would be point
zero<00:02:45.019> zero<00:02:45.320> five<00:02:47.709> 17<00:02:48.709> is<00:02:49.959> 17,000<00:02:50.959> so<00:02:51.019> point

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:51.320 
zero zero five 17 is 17,000 so point

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:56.680 
zero zero five 17 is 17,000 so point
zero<00:02:51.829> one<00:02:52.400> seven<00:02:55.209> now<00:02:56.209> let's<00:02:56.390> look<00:02:56.510> at<00:02:56.630> a

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
zero one seven now let's look at a

00:02:56.690 --> 00:03:00.640 
zero one seven now let's look at a
reading<00:02:56.930> on<00:02:57.170> here<00:02:58.450> this<00:02:59.450> mark<00:02:59.870> that<00:03:00.320> you<00:03:00.470> see

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:00.650 
reading on here this mark that you see

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:04.479 
reading on here this mark that you see
there<00:03:00.890> that<00:03:01.540> tells<00:03:02.540> us<00:03:02.690> that<00:03:02.720> we're<00:03:03.049> at<00:03:03.489> 0.3

00:03:04.479 --> 00:03:04.489 
there that tells us that we're at 0.3

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:09.400 
there that tells us that we're at 0.3
and<00:03:05.290> then<00:03:06.290> 0.3<00:03:07.040> twenty<00:03:07.400> five<00:03:07.610> point<00:03:08.450> three<00:03:08.510> 50

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:09.410 
and then 0.3 twenty five point three 50

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:14.170 
and then 0.3 twenty five point three 50
and<00:03:09.650> point<00:03:10.549> three<00:03:10.880> seven<00:03:11.269> five<00:03:12.010> so<00:03:13.010> that<00:03:13.579> mark

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
and point three seven five so that mark

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.470 
and point three seven five so that mark
represents<00:03:14.739> 0.375<00:03:15.739> the<00:03:16.670> reading<00:03:17.120> from<00:03:17.299> the

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:17.480 
represents 0.375 the reading from the

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.110 
represents 0.375 the reading from the
thimble<00:03:17.690> scale<00:03:18.140> is<00:03:18.709> zero<00:03:19.160> so<00:03:19.640> we<00:03:19.670> don't<00:03:19.790> add

00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:20.120 
thimble scale is zero so we don't add

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:22.060 
thimble scale is zero so we don't add
anything<00:03:20.600> to<00:03:20.810> the<00:03:21.230> point<00:03:21.440> three<00:03:21.650> seventy-five

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:22.070 
anything to the point three seventy-five

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:28.890 
anything to the point three seventy-five
and<00:03:24.010> so<00:03:25.010> the<00:03:25.160> reading<00:03:25.489> is<00:03:25.630> 0.375

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:32.140 

okay<00:03:29.900> so<00:03:29.960> here<00:03:30.500> I've<00:03:30.650> taken<00:03:30.980> the<00:03:31.700> micrometer

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150 
okay so here I've taken the micrometer

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.600 
okay so here I've taken the micrometer
and<00:03:32.390> I<00:03:32.810> have<00:03:33.140> moved<00:03:33.650> it<00:03:33.860> just<00:03:33.890> a<00:03:34.340> little<00:03:34.490> bit

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:34.610 
and I have moved it just a little bit

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:37.030 
and I have moved it just a little bit
back<00:03:35.360> so<00:03:35.900> we're<00:03:36.080> just<00:03:36.320> a<00:03:36.440> little<00:03:36.470> bit<00:03:36.800> less

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:37.040 
back so we're just a little bit less

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:39.940 
back so we're just a little bit less
than<00:03:37.280> 0.3<00:03:37.610> 75<00:03:38.420> and<00:03:38.780> the<00:03:39.200> question<00:03:39.560> is<00:03:39.710> what's

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:39.950 
than 0.3 75 and the question is what's

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:43.690 
than 0.3 75 and the question is what's
the<00:03:40.130> reading<00:03:40.280> now<00:03:40.610> well<00:03:42.250> we're<00:03:43.250> not<00:03:43.370> reading

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 
the reading now well we're not reading

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:45.850 
the reading now well we're not reading
from<00:03:43.940> this<00:03:44.270> mark<00:03:44.600> anymore<00:03:44.900> this<00:03:45.260> mark<00:03:45.530> is<00:03:45.650> not

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:45.860 
from this mark anymore this mark is not

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:47.170 
from this mark anymore this mark is not
actually<00:03:46.280> showing<00:03:46.520> even<00:03:46.760> though<00:03:46.940> you<00:03:47.000> can

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180 
actually showing even though you can

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:51.160 
actually showing even though you can
kind<00:03:47.480> of<00:03:47.600> see<00:03:47.900> it<00:03:47.990> the<00:03:48.770> fact<00:03:49.070> is<00:03:49.490> that<00:03:49.700> if<00:03:50.540> this

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:51.170 
kind of see it the fact is that if this

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:53.410 
kind of see it the fact is that if this
mark<00:03:51.650> order<00:03:51.920> show<00:03:52.280> it<00:03:52.550> would<00:03:52.700> be<00:03:52.790> a<00:03:52.820> brand<00:03:53.240> new

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.420 
mark order show it would be a brand new

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:55.330 
mark order show it would be a brand new
mark<00:03:53.810> and<00:03:54.050> so<00:03:54.290> the<00:03:54.440> reading<00:03:54.770> on<00:03:54.920> the<00:03:55.100> thimble

00:03:55.330 --> 00:03:55.340 
mark and so the reading on the thimble

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:57.190 
mark and so the reading on the thimble
scale<00:03:55.760> would<00:03:55.910> be<00:03:56.030> a<00:03:56.060> very<00:03:56.270> small<00:03:56.690> reading<00:03:56.960> and

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 
scale would be a very small reading and

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.250 
scale would be a very small reading and
as<00:03:57.290> you<00:03:57.410> can<00:03:57.560> see<00:03:57.830> we're<00:03:58.640> reading<00:03:59.000> 24<00:03:59.960> which<00:04:00.230> is

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:00.260 
as you can see we're reading 24 which is

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:04.150 
as you can see we're reading 24 which is
almost<00:04:01.450> completely<00:04:02.450> all<00:04:03.020> the<00:04:03.080> way<00:04:03.500> around<00:04:03.950> so

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:04.160 
almost completely all the way around so

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.460 
almost completely all the way around so
this<00:04:04.400> is<00:04:04.550> a<00:04:04.580> very<00:04:04.850> high<00:04:05.630> number<00:04:05.660> so<00:04:06.290> that<00:04:06.320> means

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.470 
this is a very high number so that means

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:08.290 
this is a very high number so that means
we're<00:04:06.770> working<00:04:07.040> off<00:04:07.130> of<00:04:07.310> the<00:04:07.460> older<00:04:07.970> mark

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:08.300 
we're working off of the older mark

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:12.580 
we're working off of the older mark
which<00:04:08.600> would<00:04:08.810> be<00:04:08.960> this<00:04:09.170> one<00:04:09.230> and<00:04:11.260> that<00:04:12.260> mark

00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:12.590 
which would be this one and that mark

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:17.770 
which would be this one and that mark
would<00:04:12.770> read<00:04:12.980> point<00:04:13.310> three<00:04:13.760> five<00:04:14.570> zero<00:04:15.489> now<00:04:16.780> we

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:17.780 
would read point three five zero now we

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:20.320 
would read point three five zero now we
can<00:04:18.020> get<00:04:18.800> the<00:04:19.130> next<00:04:19.400> decimal<00:04:19.940> place<00:04:20.120> by

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:20.330 
can get the next decimal place by

00:04:20.330 --> 00:04:23.110 
can get the next decimal place by
reading<00:04:20.690> the<00:04:20.780> thimble<00:04:21.020> scale<00:04:21.440> and<00:04:21.790> that<00:04:22.790> will

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:23.120 
reading the thimble scale and that will

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:24.640 
reading the thimble scale and that will
this<00:04:23.570> one<00:04:23.750> remember<00:04:24.020> is<00:04:24.260> reading<00:04:24.560> in

00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:24.650 
this one remember is reading in

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:26.770 
this one remember is reading in
thousandths<00:04:25.400> of<00:04:25.490> an<00:04:25.610> inch<00:04:25.700> so<00:04:26.000> this<00:04:26.180> is<00:04:26.330> 20

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780 
thousandths of an inch so this is 20

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:30.490 
thousandths of an inch so this is 20
thousands<00:04:27.350> 21<00:04:27.890> 22<00:04:28.430> 23<00:04:28.880> this<00:04:29.720> is<00:04:29.780> twenty<00:04:30.290> four

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:30.500 
thousands 21 22 23 this is twenty four

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:36.610 
thousands 21 22 23 this is twenty four
thousand<00:04:31.100> so<00:04:31.250> that's<00:04:31.430> point<00:04:31.700> O<00:04:31.850> to<00:04:31.970> four<00:04:35.620> so

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:36.620 
thousand so that's point O to four so

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:40.120 
thousand so that's point O to four so
the<00:04:36.830> reading<00:04:37.280> of<00:04:37.430> this<00:04:37.600> micrometer<00:04:38.600> is<00:04:39.130> the

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:40.130 
the reading of this micrometer is the

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:44.470 
the reading of this micrometer is the
point<00:04:40.430> 350<00:04:41.180> plus<00:04:41.840> the<00:04:42.200> point<00:04:42.590> O<00:04:42.740> 2<00:04:42.860> 4<00:04:43.490> think<00:04:44.330> of

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:44.480 
point 350 plus the point O 2 4 think of

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:49.510 
point 350 plus the point O 2 4 think of
it<00:04:44.600> as<00:04:44.750> adding<00:04:45.310> 350<00:04:46.310> and<00:04:46.840> 24<00:04:48.370> you<00:04:49.370> get<00:04:49.460> a

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:49.520 
it as adding 350 and 24 you get a

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:57.640 
it as adding 350 and 24 you get a
reading<00:04:49.850> of<00:04:49.940> 0.3<00:04:50.800> 7/4

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:57.650 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:01.240 

now<00:04:58.550> on<00:04:58.790> this<00:04:59.419> slide<00:04:59.690> we<00:04:59.960> can<00:04:59.990> see<00:05:00.169> that<00:05:00.650> we've

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:01.250 
now on this slide we can see that we've

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:03.310 
now on this slide we can see that we've
gone<00:05:01.460> past<00:05:01.880> the<00:05:02.120> zero<00:05:02.419> mark<00:05:02.720> so<00:05:03.020> we're<00:05:03.169> working

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:03.320 
gone past the zero mark so we're working

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:06.820 
gone past the zero mark so we're working
off<00:05:03.680> of<00:05:03.710> a<00:05:04.010> brand<00:05:04.490> new<00:05:04.820> number<00:05:05.419> it's<00:05:05.780> a<00:05:05.900> brand

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:06.830 
off of a brand new number it's a brand

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:09.010 
off of a brand new number it's a brand
new<00:05:06.979> mark<00:05:07.430> it's<00:05:07.850> going<00:05:08.449> to<00:05:08.510> be<00:05:08.600> a<00:05:08.630> small<00:05:08.990> number

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:09.020 
new mark it's going to be a small number

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:13.390 
new mark it's going to be a small number
