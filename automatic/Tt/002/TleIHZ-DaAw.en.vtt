00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:50.270 
I'll be right back all right so it's

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:52.000

my scarf

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.800 
my scarf
but<00:02:55.130> I<00:02:55.160> do<00:02:55.250> one<00:02:55.580> last<00:02:55.820> step<00:02:56.060> to<00:02:56.270> get<00:02:56.420> my<00:02:56.510> edges

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
but I do one last step to get my edges

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:59.470 
but I do one last step to get my edges
in<00:02:56.930> tip-top<00:02:57.170> shape<00:02:58.090> because<00:02:59.090> they're<00:02:59.270> really

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
in tip-top shape because they're really

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.190 
in tip-top shape because they're really
flat<00:02:59.959> right<00:03:00.260> now<00:03:00.730> but<00:03:01.730> I<00:03:02.060> don't<00:03:02.120> like<00:03:02.600> the<00:03:03.080> way

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
flat right now but I don't like the way

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.860 
flat right now but I don't like the way
they<00:03:03.380> look<00:03:03.730> the<00:03:04.730> appearance<00:03:05.180> of<00:03:05.300> them<00:03:05.510> I<00:03:05.690> know

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:05.870 
they look the appearance of them I know

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.500 
they look the appearance of them I know
sounds<00:03:06.290> weird<00:03:06.500> but<00:03:06.680> so<00:03:07.489> I<00:03:07.519> do<00:03:07.640> that<00:03:08.000> step<00:03:08.330> at

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:08.510 
sounds weird but so I do that step at

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:10.030 
sounds weird but so I do that step at
the<00:03:08.630> end<00:03:08.660> but<00:03:09.019> that's<00:03:09.170> basically<00:03:09.470> what<00:03:09.920> I<00:03:09.950> do

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:10.040 
the end but that's basically what I do

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:12.699 
the end but that's basically what I do
