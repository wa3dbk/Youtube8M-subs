audio performance inside a notebook when
it's<00:02:24.600> launched<00:02:24.930> the<00:02:25.290> the<00:02:25.530> chamber<00:02:25.830> size<00:02:26.040> is

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
it's launched the the chamber size is

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.190 
it's launched the the chamber size is
approximately<00:02:27.269> four<00:02:27.450> to<00:02:27.480> five<00:02:27.780> times<00:02:27.810> the

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
size of a traditional laptop each it's

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.100 
size of a traditional laptop each it's
big<00:02:31.440> has<00:02:31.590> 54<00:02:32.130> CC<00:02:32.700> which<00:02:33.480> invites<00:02:33.780> provides

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
big has 54 CC which invites provides

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.290 
big has 54 CC which invites provides
better<00:02:34.800> sound<00:02:35.040> quality<00:02:35.100> and<00:02:35.610> more<00:02:35.910> boost<00:02:36.090> as

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:36.300 
better sound quality and more boost as

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.320 
better sound quality and more boost as
well<00:02:36.330> so<00:02:36.720> a<00:02:36.750> more<00:02:36.900> basic<00:02:37.970> what<00:02:38.970> can<00:02:39.150> we<00:02:39.180> expect

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:39.330 
well so a more basic what can we expect

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.330 
well so a more basic what can we expect
it<00:02:39.750> is<00:02:39.840> a<00:02:39.870> laptop<00:02:40.080> so<00:02:40.410> what<00:02:40.530> can<00:02:40.650> we<00:02:40.769> expect<00:02:40.860> in

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
it is a laptop so what can we expect in

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.539 
it is a laptop so what can we expect in
terms<00:02:41.549> of<00:02:41.730> battery<00:02:42.030> life<00:02:42.950> is<00:02:43.950> yet<00:02:44.459> to<00:02:44.519> be

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:44.549 
terms of battery life is yet to be

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:47.600 
terms of battery life is yet to be
confirmed<00:02:44.790> at<00:02:45.030> stage<00:02:45.950> okay<00:02:46.950> so<00:02:47.010> moving<00:02:47.310> on

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
confirmed at stage okay so moving on

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.210 
confirmed at stage okay so moving on
that's<00:02:48.000> a<00:02:48.329> 10<00:02:48.840> X<00:02:48.989> 90<00:02:49.350> audiophile<00:02:49.799> laptop

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
that's a 10 X 90 audiophile laptop

as<00:03:38.050> the<00:03:38.200> hitch<00:03:38.320> is<00:03:38.350> raised<00:03:38.820> increase<00:03:39.820> the

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:39.940 
as the hitch is raised increase the

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:41.730 
as the hitch is raised increase the

management<00:03:41.860> inside<00:03:42.390> so<00:03:43.390> all<00:03:43.930> those<00:03:44.050> just<00:03:44.260> to

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:44.350 
management inside so all those just to

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:46.770 
management inside so all those just to
have<00:03:44.500> a<00:03:44.530> expanding<00:03:45.370> chassis<00:03:45.760> inside<00:03:46.420> to<00:03:46.510> be<00:03:46.600> to

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:46.780 
have a expanding chassis inside to be to

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.080 
have a expanding chassis inside to be to
fans<00:03:47.080> located<00:03:47.680> the<00:03:48.250> other<00:03:48.280> behind<00:03:48.580> that<00:03:48.850> is

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:49.090 
fans located the other behind that is

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:50.520 
fans located the other behind that is
that<00:03:49.120> it'll<00:03:49.510> just<00:03:49.660> play<00:03:49.810> all<00:03:49.960> the<00:03:50.050> heat<00:03:50.260> and

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
that it'll just play all the heat and

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:53.010 
that it'll just play all the heat and
all<00:03:50.620> the<00:03:50.710> noise<00:03:50.860> out<00:03:51.250> the<00:03:51.790> back<00:03:52.030> of<00:03:52.270> the<00:03:52.510> local

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:53.020 
all the noise out the back of the local

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:56.790 
all the noise out the back of the local
open<00:03:53.230> itself<00:03:54.210> back<00:03:55.210> you'll<00:03:55.420> see<00:03:55.800> basically

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:56.800 
open itself back you'll see basically

00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:59.340 
open itself back you'll see basically
the<00:03:56.890> large<00:03:57.040> vents<00:03:57.430> here<00:03:57.810> well<00:03:58.810> you<00:03:58.870> sure<00:03:59.080> that

00:03:59.340 --> 00:03:59.350 
the large vents here well you sure that
