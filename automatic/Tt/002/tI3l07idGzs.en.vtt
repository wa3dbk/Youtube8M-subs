then<00:02:25.720> that<00:02:26.319> doesn't<00:02:26.650> hold<00:02:26.830> no<00:02:27.220> matter<00:02:27.430> how

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
then that doesn't hold no matter how

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.819

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:29.829 
hard you try and like lock it down it

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:32.100 
hard you try and like lock it down it
won't<00:02:30.129> hold<00:02:30.310> which<00:02:30.610> means<00:02:30.790> it<00:02:31.000> will<00:02:31.239> like<00:02:31.810> fall

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.110 
won't hold which means it will like fall

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.229 
won't hold which means it will like fall
on<00:02:32.200> its<00:02:32.349> own<00:02:32.819> especially<00:02:33.819> with<00:02:33.909> a<00:02:33.970> little<00:02:34.150> bit

00:02:34.229 --> 00:02:34.239 
on its own especially with a little bit

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:36.119 
on its own especially with a little bit
of<00:02:34.299> movement<00:02:34.540> and<00:02:34.900> now<00:02:35.440> what<00:02:35.590> I've<00:02:35.680> done<00:02:35.890> to

00:02:36.119 --> 00:02:36.129 
of movement and now what I've done to

00:02:36.129 --> 00:02:37.860 
of movement and now what I've done to
fix<00:02:36.459> that<00:02:36.730> is<00:02:36.909> I've<00:02:37.030> actually<00:02:37.150> just<00:02:37.329> added<00:02:37.750> a

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
fix that is I've actually just added a

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.580 
fix that is I've actually just added a
little<00:02:38.140> washer<00:02:38.980> into<00:02:39.220> there<00:02:39.670> and<00:02:40.349> so<00:02:41.349> one<00:02:41.560> of

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
little washer into there and so one of

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.240 
little washer into there and so one of
them<00:02:41.709> at<00:02:41.799> the<00:02:41.860> moment<00:02:42.159> is<00:02:42.280> sort<00:02:43.000> of<00:02:43.060> fixed<00:02:43.780> ish

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
them at the moment is sort of fixed ish

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:50.430 
them at the moment is sort of fixed ish
whereas<00:02:45.250> the<00:02:45.370> other<00:02:45.400> one<00:02:46.200> isn't<00:02:47.849> and<00:02:49.290> the<00:02:50.290> barn

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:50.440 
whereas the other one isn't and the barn

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.099 
whereas the other one isn't and the barn
doors<00:02:50.650> are<00:02:50.890> quite<00:02:51.730> annoying<00:02:52.120> they<00:02:52.510> sort<00:02:53.049> of

00:02:53.099 --> 00:02:53.109 
doors are quite annoying they sort of

00:02:53.109 --> 00:02:56.849 
doors are quite annoying they sort of
get<00:02:53.319> in<00:02:53.440> my<00:02:53.560> way<00:02:53.590> a<00:02:53.739> bit<00:02:54.150> but<00:02:55.150> I<00:02:55.780> suppose<00:02:56.709> I'd

00:02:56.849 --> 00:02:56.859 
get in my way a bit but I suppose I'd

00:02:56.859 --> 00:02:58.319 
get in my way a bit but I suppose I'd
like<00:02:57.040> you<00:02:57.250> know<00:02:57.340> I'd<00:02:57.430> like<00:02:57.549> to<00:02:57.670> give<00:02:57.849> one<00:02:58.090> light

00:02:58.319 --> 00:02:58.329 
like you know I'd like to give one light

00:02:58.329 --> 00:03:00.479 
like you know I'd like to give one light
that<00:02:58.510> has<00:02:58.629> bonders<00:02:59.109> in<00:02:59.680> case<00:02:59.920> I'd<00:03:00.099> like<00:03:00.220> to<00:03:00.340> use

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:00.489 
that has bonders in case I'd like to use

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:01.860 
that has bonders in case I'd like to use
them<00:03:00.640> and<00:03:00.730> they<00:03:01.090> do<00:03:01.150> help<00:03:01.359> diffuse<00:03:01.720> the<00:03:01.840> light

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
them and they do help diffuse the light

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.640 
them and they do help diffuse the light
just<00:03:02.170> a<00:03:02.319> tiny<00:03:02.500> bit<00:03:02.620> so<00:03:03.159> that's<00:03:03.459> good<00:03:03.730> too

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
just a tiny bit so that's good too

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.619 
just a tiny bit so that's good too
however<00:03:05.650> the<00:03:06.129> quality<00:03:06.940> of<00:03:06.970> the<00:03:07.120> light<00:03:07.239> itself

00:03:07.619 --> 00:03:07.629 
however the quality of the light itself

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:09.660 
however the quality of the light itself
is<00:03:07.840> great<00:03:08.170> it<00:03:08.950> does<00:03:09.099> give<00:03:09.250> a<00:03:09.280> lot<00:03:09.340> of<00:03:09.489> power

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
is great it does give a lot of power

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:12.119 
is great it does give a lot of power
just<00:03:09.940> like<00:03:09.970> the<00:03:10.180> young<00:03:10.390> rose<00:03:10.629> however<00:03:10.859> the<00:03:11.859> if

00:03:12.119 --> 00:03:12.129 
just like the young rose however the if

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:14.970 
just like the young rose however the if
you<00:03:12.220> really<00:03:12.700> want<00:03:12.940> a<00:03:13.209> light<00:03:13.870> with<00:03:14.290> a<00:03:14.500> wireless

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:14.980 
you really want a light with a wireless

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:18.270 
you really want a light with a wireless
system<00:03:15.159> go<00:03:15.849> for<00:03:16.060> the<00:03:16.120> young<00:03:16.269> euro<00:03:16.530> 300<00:03:17.530> the

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
system go for the young euro 300 the

system go for the young euro 300 the
wine<00:03:18.400> 300<00:03:19.030> gives<00:03:19.329> you<00:03:19.510> I<00:03:19.750> believe<00:03:20.349> probably

00:03:20.879 --> 00:03:20.889 
wine 300 gives you I believe probably

00:03:20.889 --> 00:03:23.430 
wine 300 gives you I believe probably
even<00:03:21.010> the<00:03:21.190> same<00:03:21.400> remote<00:03:21.669> system<00:03:22.120> however<00:03:22.750> you

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440 
even the same remote system however you

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:24.870 
even the same remote system however you
do<00:03:23.560> get<00:03:23.680> a<00:03:23.709> better<00:03:23.859> quality<00:03:24.069> light<00:03:24.519> and<00:03:24.790> you

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:24.880 
do get a better quality light and you

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:26.909 
do get a better quality light and you
don't<00:03:25.060> get<00:03:25.209> the<00:03:25.329> shitty<00:03:25.540> mount<00:03:25.840> and<00:03:26.109> you<00:03:26.650> don't

00:03:26.909 --> 00:03:26.919 
don't get the shitty mount and you don't

00:03:26.919 --> 00:03:31.170 
don't get the shitty mount and you don't
get<00:03:27.099> hopefully<00:03:27.849> it<00:03:28.090> won't<00:03:28.269> stab<00:03:28.599> you<00:03:29.099> and<00:03:30.180> so

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:31.180 
get hopefully it won't stab you and so

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:33.180 
get hopefully it won't stab you and so
overall<00:03:31.569> this<00:03:32.019> is<00:03:32.230> not<00:03:32.829> a<00:03:32.859> recommended

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190 
overall this is not a recommended

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:36.599 
overall this is not a recommended
product<00:03:33.609> and<00:03:34.560> you<00:03:35.560> know<00:03:35.680> it's<00:03:35.889> usable<00:03:36.310> if<00:03:36.519> you

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:36.609 
product and you know it's usable if you

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:38.520 
product and you know it's usable if you
go<00:03:36.730> on<00:03:36.879> its<00:03:37.060> usable<00:03:37.389> it<00:03:37.540> gives<00:03:37.690> good<00:03:37.810> light<00:03:38.049> I

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530 
go on its usable it gives good light I

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.770 
go on its usable it gives good light I
think<00:03:39.250> it's<00:03:39.370> a<00:03:39.430> great<00:03:39.459> idea<00:03:39.940> to<00:03:40.269> have<00:03:40.510> wireless

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:40.780 
think it's a great idea to have wireless

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:43.319 
think it's a great idea to have wireless
system<00:03:41.319> you<00:03:41.680> can<00:03:41.859> put<00:03:42.250> it<00:03:42.340> up<00:03:42.430> somewhere<00:03:42.459> turn

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:43.329 
system you can put it up somewhere turn

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:45.030 
system you can put it up somewhere turn
it<00:03:43.419> on<00:03:43.510> and<00:03:43.629> off<00:03:43.720> if<00:03:44.319> you<00:03:44.440> want<00:03:44.650> to<00:03:44.739> have<00:03:44.859> one

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:45.040 
it on and off if you want to have one

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.009 
it on and off if you want to have one
like<00:03:45.190> that<00:03:45.250> you<00:03:45.430> could<00:03:45.579> maybe<00:03:46.120> turn<00:03:46.419> on<00:03:46.540> during

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:47.019 
like that you could maybe turn on during

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:50.159 
like that you could maybe turn on during
a<00:03:47.109> shot<00:03:47.379> or<00:03:47.829> turn<00:03:48.340> on<00:03:48.609> you<00:03:49.510> know<00:03:49.599> turn<00:03:49.870> off<00:03:49.989> from

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:50.169 
a shot or turn on you know turn off from

00:03:50.169 --> 00:03:51.930 
a shot or turn on you know turn off from
far<00:03:50.470> away<00:03:50.500> maybe<00:03:50.889> that's<00:03:51.069> your<00:03:51.190> backlight<00:03:51.699> and

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:51.940 
far away maybe that's your backlight and

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:53.849 
far away maybe that's your backlight and
you<00:03:52.329> don't<00:03:52.510> have<00:03:52.660> to<00:03:52.810> keep<00:03:52.989> running<00:03:53.230> back<00:03:53.590> to

00:03:53.849 --> 00:03:53.859 
you don't have to keep running back to

00:03:53.859 --> 00:03:55.890 
you don't have to keep running back to
get<00:03:54.069> it<00:03:54.220> and<00:03:54.370> you<00:03:54.940> can<00:03:55.120> just<00:03:55.239> turn<00:03:55.419> it<00:03:55.540> off<00:03:55.599> with

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:55.900 
get it and you can just turn it off with

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:58.740 
get it and you can just turn it off with
a<00:03:56.079> remote<00:03:56.590> right<00:03:57.549> now<00:03:57.669> the<00:03:57.730> remote<00:03:58.120> is<00:03:58.329> giving

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:58.750 
a remote right now the remote is giving

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:02.909 
a remote right now the remote is giving
me<00:03:58.840> a<00:03:58.870> little<00:03:59.079> bit<00:03:59.260> of<00:04:01.109> light<00:04:02.109> from<00:04:02.410> there<00:04:02.650> but

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:02.919 
me a little bit of light from there but

00:04:02.919 --> 00:04:05.189 
me a little bit of light from there but
it's<00:04:03.129> still<00:04:03.340> not<00:04:03.579> able<00:04:03.940> to<00:04:04.299> get<00:04:04.480> any<00:04:04.660> anything

00:04:05.189 --> 00:04:05.199 
it's still not able to get any anything

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:06.770 
it's still not able to get any anything
so<00:04:05.319> the<00:04:05.379> batteries<00:04:05.650> lat<00:04:05.799> almost<00:04:06.069> dead<00:04:06.250> and

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
so the batteries lat almost dead and

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:09.360 
so the batteries lat almost dead and
that<00:04:07.780> sucks<00:04:08.079> because<00:04:08.319> it<00:04:09.040> would<00:04:09.190> have<00:04:09.280> been

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:09.370 
that sucks because it would have been

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:11.009 
that sucks because it would have been
better<00:04:09.519> if<00:04:09.609> they<00:04:09.760> gave<00:04:09.910> a<00:04:09.940> larger<00:04:10.329> remote<00:04:10.599> that

00:04:11.009 --> 00:04:11.019 
better if they gave a larger remote that

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:12.930 
better if they gave a larger remote that
takes<00:04:11.260> triple<00:04:12.069> a<00:04:12.160> batteries<00:04:12.489> or<00:04:12.669> something

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:12.940 
takes triple a batteries or something

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:15.509 
takes triple a batteries or something
allow<00:04:13.120> this<00:04:13.780> thing<00:04:13.840> takes<00:04:14.340> some<00:04:15.340> sort<00:04:15.489> of

00:04:15.509 --> 00:04:15.519 
allow this thing takes some sort of

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:18.029 
allow this thing takes some sort of
button<00:04:15.819> battery<00:04:16.599> and<00:04:16.750> that's<00:04:17.139> just<00:04:17.410> I<00:04:17.620> don't

00:04:18.029 --> 00:04:18.039 
button battery and that's just I don't

00:04:18.039 --> 00:04:19.469 
button battery and that's just I don't
know<00:04:18.190> I<00:04:18.370> don't<00:04:18.549> understand<00:04:18.880> why<00:04:18.970> any<00:04:19.150> company

00:04:19.469 --> 00:04:19.479 
know I don't understand why any company

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:21.779 
know I don't understand why any company
does<00:04:19.630> that<00:04:19.810> unless<00:04:20.470> it's<00:04:20.650> a<00:04:20.709> watch<00:04:20.889> it's<00:04:21.609> not<00:04:21.760> a

does that unless it's a watch it's not a

00:04:21.789 --> 00:04:24.860 
does that unless it's a watch it's not a
watch<00:04:21.969> don't<00:04:22.719> put<00:04:22.870> a<00:04:22.900> button<00:04:23.169> in<00:04:23.229> it<00:04:23.380> that's<00:04:23.740> my

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:24.870
