can<00:02:28.320> avoid<00:02:28.530> that<00:02:28.590> also<00:02:29.420> this<00:02:30.420> mix<00:02:30.690> all<00:02:30.870> these

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:31.020 
can avoid that also this mix all these

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:36.080 
can avoid that also this mix all these
things<00:02:31.230> together<00:02:33.890> then<00:02:34.890> this<00:02:35.130> is<00:02:35.250> still<00:02:35.790> wit

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.090 
things together then this is still wit

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.660 
things together then this is still wit
you<00:02:36.780> can<00:02:36.990> sprinkle<00:02:37.320> like<00:02:37.590> that<00:02:37.740> itself<00:02:38.100> or<00:02:38.370> if

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:38.670 
you can sprinkle like that itself or if

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.140 
you can sprinkle like that itself or if
if<00:02:38.940> it<00:02:39.420> is<00:02:39.480> already<00:02:39.780> dry<00:02:40.050> I<00:02:40.170> have<00:02:41.150> already

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:42.150 
if it is already dry I have already

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:44.120 
if it is already dry I have already
washed<00:02:42.630> it<00:02:42.870> long<00:02:43.050> before<00:02:43.260> it's<00:02:43.830> been<00:02:44.010> too

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:44.130 
washed it long before it's been too

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:50.199 
washed it long before it's been too
little<00:02:44.280> water<00:02:44.930> and<00:02:45.930> then<00:02:46.310> add<00:02:47.310> this<00:02:47.640> to<00:02:48.180> coat

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:50.209 
little water and then add this to coat

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:54.320 
little water and then add this to coat
and<00:02:51.320> now<00:02:52.320> you<00:02:52.380> have<00:02:52.650> to<00:02:52.800> deep-fry<00:02:53.040> it<00:02:53.330> directly

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
and now you have to deep-fry it directly

00:02:54.330 --> 00:03:04.430 
and now you have to deep-fry it directly
in<00:02:54.510> the<00:02:54.570> hot<00:02:55.140> oil<00:02:55.170> I<00:02:57.650> just<00:02:58.650> put<00:02:58.890> this<00:02:59.070> in<00:02:59.280> this

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:13.690 

you

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.250 

so<00:03:14.700> this<00:03:14.850> is<00:03:14.970> the<00:03:15.120> color<00:03:15.300> which<00:03:15.840> you<00:03:16.050> should
