glue monster
I'm<00:05:21.710> just<00:05:22.710> you're<00:05:23.430> probably<00:05:23.580> wondering<00:05:24.000> why<00:05:24.180> I

I'm just you're probably wondering why I
got<00:05:24.420> to<00:05:24.900> VG's<00:05:25.260> because<00:05:29.240> on<00:05:30.240> the<00:05:30.330> other<00:05:30.390> side

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:30.630 
got to VG's because on the other side

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:33.130 
got to VG's because on the other side
see<00:05:31.380> what<00:05:31.500> we<00:05:31.590> did

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:33.140 
see what we did

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:35.600 
see what we did
so<00:05:34.140> there's<00:05:34.290> only<00:05:34.350> one<00:05:34.470> side<00:05:34.770> done<00:05:34.980> let's<00:05:35.460> move

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:35.610 
so there's only one side done let's move

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:39.860 
so there's only one side done let's move
on<00:05:35.730> to<00:05:35.760> the<00:05:35.910> next<00:05:36.000> one<00:05:36.180> so<00:05:37.250> this<00:05:38.250> is<00:05:38.490> oh<00:05:38.870> it's

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:39.870 
on to the next one so this is oh it's

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:42.170 
on to the next one so this is oh it's
not<00:05:39.960> completed<00:05:40.550> but<00:05:41.550> it<00:05:41.640> should<00:05:41.910> look<00:05:42.120> like

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:42.180 
not completed but it should look like

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:46.820 
not completed but it should look like
this<00:05:44.570> so<00:05:45.570> this<00:05:45.810> is<00:05:45.900> the<00:05:45.990> complete<00:05:46.320> version<00:05:46.620> of

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:46.830 
this so this is the complete version of

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:50.930 
this so this is the complete version of
the<00:05:46.950> whole<00:05:47.130> thing<00:05:47.400> and<00:05:48.500> yeah<00:05:49.730> the<00:05:50.730> reason

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:50.940 
the whole thing and yeah the reason

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:52.730 
the whole thing and yeah the reason
BlueTEC<00:05:51.450> oh<00:05:51.480> I<00:05:51.600> did<00:05:51.840> a<00:05:51.870> bit<00:05:52.080> at<00:05:52.350> the<00:05:52.500> bit<00:05:52.650> of

00:05:52.730 --> 00:05:52.740 
BlueTEC oh I did a bit at the bit of

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:55.300 
BlueTEC oh I did a bit at the bit of
blood<00:05:52.890> sack<00:05:53.100> and<00:05:53.310> I<00:05:53.370> stuck<00:05:53.850> these<00:05:54.600> on<00:05:54.870> as<00:05:55.020> well

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:55.310 
blood sack and I stuck these on as well

00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:59.210 
blood sack and I stuck these on as well
liberal<00:05:56.310> lipid<00:05:57.210> things<00:05:57.710> so<00:05:58.710> it<00:05:58.830> makes<00:05:58.980> it<00:05:59.070> ten

00:05:59.210 --> 00:05:59.220 
liberal lipid things so it makes it ten

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:00.890 
liberal lipid things so it makes it ten
times<00:05:59.310> stronger<00:05:59.669> but<00:06:00.180> I'm<00:06:00.419> going<00:06:00.600> to<00:06:00.690> get

00:06:00.890 --> 00:06:00.900 
times stronger but I'm going to get

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:03.230 
times stronger but I'm going to get
looser<00:06:01.169> I<00:06:01.290> can<00:06:01.470> stick<00:06:01.860> all<00:06:02.070> the<00:06:02.310> in<00:06:02.430> like<00:06:02.640> it

00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:03.240 
looser I can stick all the in like it

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:04.570 
looser I can stick all the in like it
doesn't<00:06:03.419> look<00:06:03.540> stick<00:06:03.810> out<00:06:03.960> or<00:06:04.050> anything
