00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.419
 once on everyone's lips during a 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.670
 interview to the rolling magazine are 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:07.170
 the announcer shot without qualms like the 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.090
 drive i have personal reasons 

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.410
 I think jules wine page barragán play 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.240
 a public role but when the 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.190
 confrontations do not tell you the same 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:17.070
 that seems unfair to me because then 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:20.220
 You're a hit man and I discovered the whore 

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:23.760
 mother I thought I would never know that 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.740
 What good did you say I'm a hit man? 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:30.060
 all the fear that today makes the dress of 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:32.040
 hit man so there are no excess hit men 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.270
 but several did not have hairs on the tongue to 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.890
 the time to criticize even the same 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.750
 magazine that was giving him a cover 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.969
 and central interview declaring his anger 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:40.649
 because in other editions he had the same 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.820
 place wainnright the question of 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.370
 journalists and he was still a guy 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:45.960
 rabid was the trigger to continue 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.940
 with his criticism the difference is that 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.770
 Matías comes to you differently and another kind of 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.690
 listened to say barbarities to the air of 

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.090
 me the issue is that later when we in 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.160
 faces they said not mario but he's an uncle 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.100
 television then for me it was the worst 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.600
 that before is all lies and why not 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.550
 clear that it is a game for television by 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:04.500
 his part sebastián wainraich did not stay 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.440
 back and this was what he answered after 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.820
 the controversial statements 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:11.250
 it seems to me that he has hell in the 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.380
 head like that the chabón can not 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.060
 enjoy what you have as a 

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:17.100
 millionaire with sadness it seems that it is 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:19.640
 that but poor because it happens for the 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:21.750
 that do not make notes and talk about me 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.300
 I have a lot of things to do but 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:26.070
 It's all gives me more pain than be 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:29.130
 a real great look that people who 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:33.050
 he worked with him he always loves the lug 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.050
 and as you are always full 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:41.220
 we will also take the treaty 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:43.170
 as usual pergolini always gives 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.670
 the note each word has its own weight and 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.320
 more when he gets among others 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.390
 radial conductors in the case of 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:50.130
 matías martin is another one that is also 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.390
 ironically in the crosshairs is when I 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.950
 I fight with someone I fight because I have 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.110
 a reason as is the case of Matías 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.940
 who goes out to defend his friends there 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.759
 everything is fine because it comes from the front 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.660
 air or out of the air for him there's 

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.130
 differences 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:04.020
 again pergolini in the eye of the 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.790
 storm serves because I miss having 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:09.200
 prominence that he lost on TV that 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.200
 he attacks without ceasing all
