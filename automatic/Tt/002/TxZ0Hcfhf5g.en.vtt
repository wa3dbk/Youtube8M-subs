00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:43.570 
the trades

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:46.850 
the trades
and<00:04:44.340> wherever<00:04:45.340> women<00:04:45.970> go<00:04:46.150> they<00:04:46.420> leave

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:46.860 
and wherever women go they leave

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:49.980 
and wherever women go they leave
profound<00:04:47.860> influence<00:04:48.760> on<00:04:49.030> everything<00:04:49.480> they<00:04:49.930> do

profound influence on everything they do
and<00:04:50.530> so<00:04:51.250> now<00:04:51.460> men<00:04:51.970> and<00:04:52.180> the<00:04:52.240> trades<00:04:52.540> can<00:04:52.780> see

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:53.050 
and so now men and the trades can see

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:55.440 
and so now men and the trades can see
that<00:04:53.470> it's<00:04:53.980> a<00:04:54.070> place<00:04:54.280> for<00:04:54.580> women<00:04:54.940> as<00:04:55.240> well

00:04:55.440 --> 00:04:55.450 
that it's a place for women as well

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:58.500 
that it's a place for women as well
exactly<00:04:56.260> that<00:04:56.680> women<00:04:57.100> can<00:04:57.430> do<00:04:57.790> the<00:04:58.000> work<00:04:58.180> we

00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:58.510 
exactly that women can do the work we

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:01.560 
exactly that women can do the work we
can<00:04:58.870> do<00:04:59.290> math<00:04:59.590> they<00:04:59.920> thought<00:05:00.220> we<00:05:00.460> just<00:05:00.730> simply

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:01.570 
can do math they thought we just simply

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:03.660 
can do math they thought we just simply
didn't<00:05:01.900> have<00:05:02.020> the<00:05:02.200> ability<00:05:02.530> and<00:05:03.130> weren't

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:03.670 
didn't have the ability and weren't

00:05:03.670 --> 00:05:06.630 
didn't have the ability and weren't
smart<00:05:04.060> enough<00:05:04.210> but<00:05:04.780> we<00:05:05.050> are<00:05:05.320> exactly<00:05:06.250> and<00:05:06.370> we

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:06.640 
smart enough but we are exactly and we

00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:09.390 
smart enough but we are exactly and we
are<00:05:06.820> a<00:05:06.850> great<00:05:07.270> resource<00:05:07.990> in<00:05:08.290> this<00:05:08.590> area<00:05:09.160> of

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:09.400 
are a great resource in this area of

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.850 
are a great resource in this area of
work<00:05:09.730> and<00:05:10.060> I<00:05:10.510> am<00:05:10.540> truly<00:05:11.170> trying<00:05:11.440> to<00:05:11.620> promote

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:11.860 
work and I am truly trying to promote

00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:14.970 
work and I am truly trying to promote
that<00:05:12.310> because<00:05:13.000> the<00:05:13.510> pay<00:05:13.780> is<00:05:14.020> good<00:05:14.380> and<00:05:14.710> it<00:05:14.830> is<00:05:14.860> a

00:05:14.970 --> 00:05:14.980 
that because the pay is good and it is a

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:17.970

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:25.000 
need to get trained what kind of

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.390 
need to get trained what kind of
subjects<00:05:25.510> would<00:05:26.140> you<00:05:26.320> encourage<00:05:26.770> women<00:05:27.100> to

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:27.400 
subjects would you encourage women to

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.460 
subjects would you encourage women to
start<00:05:27.910> take<00:05:28.120> our<00:05:28.360> young<00:05:28.510> girls<00:05:28.750> definitely

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:29.470 
start take our young girls definitely

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:33.510 
start take our young girls definitely
math<00:05:30.300> math<00:05:31.300> and<00:05:31.810> math<00:05:32.080> together<00:05:32.410> okay<00:05:33.130> it's

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:33.520 
math math and math together okay it's

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:36.480 
math math and math together okay it's
math<00:05:33.790> such<00:05:34.180> as<00:05:34.530> trigonometry<00:05:35.530> calculus

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:36.490 
math such as trigonometry calculus

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:40.830 
math such as trigonometry calculus
geometry<00:05:38.010> we<00:05:39.010> can<00:05:39.040> do<00:05:39.520> math<00:05:39.880> it<00:05:40.180> just<00:05:40.540> takes

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:40.840 
geometry we can do math it just takes

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.590 
geometry we can do math it just takes
focus<00:05:41.350> and<00:05:41.620> discipline<00:05:42.610> right<00:05:42.940> I<00:05:43.150> love<00:05:43.420> that

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:43.600

attitude because so many girls it seems

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:47.970 
attitude because so many girls it seems
at<00:05:45.760> age<00:05:45.910> 12<00:05:46.330> start<00:05:47.080> thinking<00:05:47.410> they<00:05:47.500> can't<00:05:47.770> do

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:47.980 
at age 12 start thinking they can't do

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:50.220 
at age 12 start thinking they can't do
math<00:05:48.190> it's<00:05:48.550> like<00:05:48.700> we<00:05:49.090> can<00:05:49.270> do<00:05:49.420> math<00:05:49.660> come<00:05:50.050> on

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:50.230 
math it's like we can do math come on

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:52.740 
math it's like we can do math come on
young<00:05:50.590> but<00:05:51.040> we<00:05:51.160> can<00:05:51.310> do<00:05:51.460> this<00:05:51.640> right<00:05:51.700> I'm<00:05:52.450> so

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:52.750 
young but we can do this right I'm so

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:54.360 
young but we can do this right I'm so
