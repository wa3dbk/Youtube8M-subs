or<00:01:55.710> one<00:01:55.950> LED<00:01:56.460> means<00:01:57.030> it's<00:01:57.479> almost<00:01:57.750> empty<00:01:57.990> four

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
or one LED means it's almost empty four

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.069 
or one LED means it's almost empty four
means<00:01:59.219> it's<00:01:59.460> fully<00:01:59.759> charged<00:02:00.360> if<00:02:00.630> there's<00:02:01.020> a

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
means it's fully charged if there's a

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.899 
means it's fully charged if there's a
blinking<00:02:01.560> light<00:02:01.619> that<00:02:02.280> means<00:02:02.579> it's<00:02:02.820> still

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
blinking light that means it's still

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.240 
blinking light that means it's still
charging<00:02:03.390> now<00:02:04.320> an<00:02:04.439> important<00:02:04.829> question<00:02:04.950> I

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
charging now an important question I

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.550 
charging now an important question I
think<00:02:05.310> is<00:02:05.670> okay<00:02:06.390> once<00:02:06.719> it's<00:02:06.930> fully<00:02:07.140> charged

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
think is okay once it's fully charged

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.260 
think is okay once it's fully charged
how<00:02:07.979> long<00:02:08.160> does<00:02:08.310> it<00:02:08.369> last<00:02:08.489> I<00:02:08.819> mean<00:02:08.940> if<00:02:09.030> you<00:02:09.090> take

00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:09.270 
how long does it last I mean if you take

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:11.240 
how long does it last I mean if you take
this<00:02:09.420> thing<00:02:09.690> you<00:02:10.110> know<00:02:10.200> on<00:02:10.259> a<00:02:10.289> camping<00:02:10.739> trip<00:02:10.770> or

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
this thing you know on a camping trip or

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.699 
this thing you know on a camping trip or
any<00:02:11.819> trip<00:02:12.360> you<00:02:12.870> know<00:02:12.989> will<00:02:13.349> the

00:02:13.699 --> 00:02:13.709 
any trip you know will the

00:02:13.709 --> 00:02:15.740 
any trip you know will the
the<00:02:13.890> charge<00:02:14.159> start<00:02:14.640> to<00:02:14.790> fade<00:02:14.969> over<00:02:15.000> time<00:02:15.269> I

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
the charge start to fade over time I

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.009 
the charge start to fade over time I
would<00:02:16.530> say<00:02:16.890> what<00:02:17.430> I<00:02:17.459> found<00:02:17.700> is<00:02:17.909> over<00:02:18.180> about<00:02:18.599> two

00:02:19.009 --> 00:02:19.019 
would say what I found is over about two

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:20.750 
would say what I found is over about two
weeks<00:02:19.260> after<00:02:19.530> about<00:02:19.739> two<00:02:19.980> weeks<00:02:20.159> it<00:02:20.310> starts<00:02:20.579> to

00:02:20.750 --> 00:02:20.760 
weeks after about two weeks it starts to

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.729 
weeks after about two weeks it starts to
lose<00:02:20.939> its<00:02:21.150> charge<00:02:21.480> a<00:02:21.629> little<00:02:21.870> bit<00:02:21.989> so<00:02:22.170> gives

00:02:22.729 --> 00:02:22.739 
lose its charge a little bit so gives

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:25.880 
lose its charge a little bit so gives
you<00:02:22.859> plenty<00:02:23.219> of<00:02:23.400> time<00:02:24.230> you<00:02:25.230> know<00:02:25.319> I<00:02:25.349> think<00:02:25.530> for

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:25.890 
you plenty of time you know I think for

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:27.949 
you plenty of time you know I think for
most<00:02:26.340> trips<00:02:26.670> and<00:02:26.909> then<00:02:27.239> it's<00:02:27.390> not<00:02:27.599> that<00:02:27.840> the

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
most trips and then it's not that the

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:30.349 
most trips and then it's not that the
charge<00:02:28.230> is<00:02:28.290> is<00:02:28.709> gone<00:02:29.040> it's<00:02:29.430> just<00:02:29.489> it<00:02:29.760> starts<00:02:30.090> to

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:30.359 
charge is is gone it's just it starts to

00:02:30.359 --> 00:02:34.129 
charge is is gone it's just it starts to
lose<00:02:31.200> its<00:02:31.379> charge<00:02:31.680> the<00:02:32.310> other<00:02:32.430> thing<00:02:32.849> is<00:02:33.139> okay

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:34.139 
lose its charge the other thing is okay

00:02:34.139 --> 00:02:36.349 
lose its charge the other thing is okay
how<00:02:34.560> many<00:02:34.620> times<00:02:35.069> can<00:02:35.579> you<00:02:35.609> charge<00:02:36.030> this

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:36.359 
how many times can you charge this

00:02:36.359 --> 00:02:38.420 
how many times can you charge this
before<00:02:37.139> it<00:02:37.230> starts<00:02:37.560> to<00:02:37.650> lose<00:02:38.370> its

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:38.430 
before it starts to lose its

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.770 
before it starts to lose its
effectiveness<00:02:39.260> it'll<00:02:40.260> go<00:02:40.489> 500<00:02:41.489> full<00:02:42.000> charge

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
effectiveness it'll go 500 full charge

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.319 
effectiveness it'll go 500 full charge
cycles<00:02:43.620> now<00:02:44.310> when<00:02:44.609> I<00:02:44.639> first<00:02:44.909> heard<00:02:45.090> that<00:02:45.150> I

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:45.329 
cycles now when I first heard that I

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:47.089 
cycles now when I first heard that I
thought<00:02:45.420> well<00:02:45.750> that's<00:02:45.900> not<00:02:46.079> very<00:02:46.200> much<00:02:46.319> 500

00:02:47.089 --> 00:02:47.099 
thought well that's not very much 500

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:51.349 
thought well that's not very much 500
but<00:02:47.669> it's<00:02:47.970> again<00:02:48.419> 500<00:02:48.810> full<00:02:49.650> charges<00:02:50.359> partial

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:51.359 
but it's again 500 full charges partial

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:53.899 
but it's again 500 full charges partial
charges<00:02:51.720> don't<00:02:52.109> count<00:02:52.579> so<00:02:53.579> if<00:02:53.669> you're<00:02:53.790> only

00:02:53.899 --> 00:02:53.909 
charges don't count so if you're only

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:58.220 
charges don't count so if you're only
doing<00:02:54.840> a<00:02:55.470> half<00:02:55.739> charge<00:02:56.250> then<00:02:57.000> it<00:02:57.659> would<00:02:57.900> you

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:58.230 
doing a half charge then it would you

00:02:58.230 --> 00:02:59.809 
doing a half charge then it would you
know<00:02:58.349> in<00:02:58.469> a<00:02:58.530> sense<00:02:58.709> be<00:02:58.889> giving<00:02:59.129> you<00:02:59.189> a<00:02:59.219> thousand

00:02:59.809 --> 00:02:59.819 
know in a sense be giving you a thousand

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:01.759 
know in a sense be giving you a thousand
and<00:02:59.969> so<00:03:00.000> if<00:03:00.419> you<00:03:00.510> think<00:03:00.540> about<00:03:00.930> it<00:03:01.139> let's<00:03:01.590> say

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:01.769 
and so if you think about it let's say

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:04.819 
and so if you think about it let's say
you're<00:03:02.069> using<00:03:02.310> this<00:03:02.840> you<00:03:03.840> know<00:03:03.989> once<00:03:04.379> a<00:03:04.590> week

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:04.829 
you're using this you know once a week

00:03:04.829 --> 00:03:08.479 
you're using this you know once a week
you<00:03:05.340> know<00:03:05.489> to<00:03:05.549> to<00:03:06.389> you<00:03:07.169> completely<00:03:07.829> drain<00:03:08.189> this

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:08.489 
you know to to you completely drain this

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:10.429 
you know to to you completely drain this
once<00:03:08.819> a<00:03:09.000> week<00:03:09.030> you<00:03:09.810> know<00:03:09.930> that's<00:03:10.139> basically

00:03:10.429 --> 00:03:10.439 
once a week you know that's basically

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:14.300 
once a week you know that's basically
500<00:03:11.250> weeks<00:03:11.510> there's<00:03:12.510> 52<00:03:12.810> weeks<00:03:13.139> in<00:03:13.319> a<00:03:13.439> year<00:03:13.469> so

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
500 weeks there's 52 weeks in a year so

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.110 
500 weeks there's 52 weeks in a year so
you<00:03:15.269> know<00:03:15.389> obviously<00:03:15.659> that's<00:03:16.019> giving<00:03:16.319> you

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:17.120 
you know obviously that's giving you

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.530 
you know obviously that's giving you
quite<00:03:18.120> a<00:03:18.180> while<00:03:18.379> the<00:03:19.379> other<00:03:19.409> thing<00:03:20.010> is<00:03:20.540> when

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
quite a while the other thing is when

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.420 
quite a while the other thing is when
you're<00:03:21.690> charging<00:03:22.169> something<00:03:22.590> you<00:03:22.979> get<00:03:23.159> about

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:23.430 
you're charging something you get about

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:26.110 
you're charging something you get about
two<00:03:23.940> and<00:03:24.239> a<00:03:24.299> half<00:03:24.329> charges<00:03:25.319> of<00:03:25.470> say<00:03:25.680> an<00:03:25.829> iPhone

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120 
two and a half charges of say an iPhone

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.059 
two and a half charges of say an iPhone
so<00:03:27.120> you<00:03:27.180> can<00:03:27.419> fully<00:03:27.810> charge<00:03:28.290> your<00:03:28.379> iPhone<00:03:28.919> if

00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:29.069 
so you can fully charge your iPhone if

00:03:29.069 --> 00:03:31.129 
so you can fully charge your iPhone if
it's<00:03:29.220> been<00:03:29.400> completely<00:03:29.790> drained<00:03:30.180> about<00:03:30.810> two

00:03:31.129 --> 00:03:31.139 
it's been completely drained about two

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:33.830 
it's been completely drained about two
and<00:03:31.319> a<00:03:31.349> half<00:03:31.530> times<00:03:32.329> just<00:03:33.329> to<00:03:33.510> give<00:03:33.659> you<00:03:33.750> an

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
and a half times just to give you an

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:36.349 
and a half times just to give you an
idea<00:03:34.109> so<00:03:34.319> let's<00:03:34.739> say<00:03:34.919> two<00:03:34.979> times<00:03:35.609> to<00:03:36.239> be

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:36.359 
idea so let's say two times to be

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:39.140 
idea so let's say two times to be
conservative<00:03:36.900> so<00:03:37.769> if<00:03:38.370> you're<00:03:38.729> let's<00:03:39.060> say

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
conservative so if you're let's say

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:40.939 
conservative so if you're let's say
you're<00:03:39.510> using<00:03:39.540> this<00:03:39.870> to<00:03:40.109> hypothetically

00:03:40.939 --> 00:03:40.949 
you're using this to hypothetically

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:44.089 
you're using this to hypothetically
charge<00:03:41.250> an<00:03:41.400> iPhone<00:03:42.229> every<00:03:43.229> and<00:03:43.470> you<00:03:43.560> were<00:03:43.829> to

00:03:44.089 --> 00:03:44.099 
charge an iPhone every and you were to

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:45.890 
charge an iPhone every and you were to
let's<00:03:44.609> see<00:03:44.729> need<00:03:44.879> to<00:03:45.060> fully<00:03:45.329> charge<00:03:45.449> your

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:45.900 
let's see need to fully charge your

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:50.689 
let's see need to fully charge your
iPhone<00:03:46.909> you<00:03:47.909> know<00:03:48.000> once<00:03:48.329> a<00:03:48.540> week<00:03:48.720> then<00:03:49.439> you<00:03:50.159> go

00:03:50.689 --> 00:03:50.699 
iPhone you know once a week then you go

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:52.520 
iPhone you know once a week then you go
through<00:03:50.729> a<00:03:50.970> charge<00:03:51.239> once<00:03:51.509> every<00:03:51.810> two<00:03:52.049> weeks<00:03:52.079> or

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
through a charge once every two weeks or

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.409 
through a charge once every two weeks or
if<00:03:52.799> you're<00:03:52.949> fully<00:03:53.220> charging<00:03:53.819> your<00:03:53.970> iPhone

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:54.419 
if you're fully charging your iPhone

00:03:54.419 --> 00:03:56.990 
if you're fully charging your iPhone
twice<00:03:55.290> a<00:03:55.319> week<00:03:55.739> and<00:03:56.040> you'd<00:03:56.280> go<00:03:56.459> through<00:03:56.699> a<00:03:56.790> full

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:57.000 
twice a week and you'd go through a full

00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.569 
twice a week and you'd go through a full
charge<00:03:57.299> of<00:03:57.629> this<00:03:57.780> once<00:03:58.379> a<00:03:58.560> week<00:03:58.709> just<00:03:58.979> to<00:03:59.430> give

00:03:59.569 --> 00:03:59.579 
charge of this once a week just to give

00:03:59.579 --> 00:04:01.759 
charge of this once a week just to give
you<00:03:59.669> an<00:03:59.759> idea<00:04:00.030> so<00:04:00.239> basically<00:04:00.780> it<00:04:01.049> lasts<00:04:01.530> quite

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:01.769 
you an idea so basically it lasts quite

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:03.800 
you an idea so basically it lasts quite
a<00:04:01.919> while<00:04:02.250> I<00:04:02.489> mean<00:04:02.699> definitely<00:04:02.909> a<00:04:03.329> few<00:04:03.569> years

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:03.810 
a while I mean definitely a few years

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.479 
a while I mean definitely a few years
and<00:04:04.019> I<00:04:04.409> think<00:04:04.620> for<00:04:04.769> most<00:04:04.889> people<00:04:05.040> they're<00:04:05.459> not

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:05.489 
and I think for most people they're not

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:07.280 
and I think for most people they're not
probably<00:04:06.000> using<00:04:06.720> this<00:04:06.810> to<00:04:06.989> fully<00:04:07.199> charge

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:07.290 
probably using this to fully charge

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.979 
probably using this to fully charge
something<00:04:07.799> but<00:04:08.099> if<00:04:08.250> you<00:04:08.370> do<00:04:08.519> you<00:04:09.479> kind<00:04:09.750> of<00:04:09.870> know

00:04:09.979 --> 00:04:09.989 
something but if you do you kind of know

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:11.629 
something but if you do you kind of know
how<00:04:10.139> it<00:04:10.199> works<00:04:10.379> so<00:04:10.979> that's<00:04:11.099> basically<00:04:11.519> all

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:11.639 
how it works so that's basically all

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:14.569 
how it works so that's basically all
