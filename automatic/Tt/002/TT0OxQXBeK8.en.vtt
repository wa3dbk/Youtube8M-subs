00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:21.790
 b 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:25.170
 m 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.539
 and 

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.600
 and 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:36.079
 and 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.750
 on the first agreement it's a deal of 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:01.340
 back we're going to do an arpeggio have done 

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.340
 ring the four middle bodies 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:13.240
 and we will play with a small hammer here 

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.240
 we will do 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:18.990
 which gives the effect of 

00:01:19.649 --> 00:01:26.350
 2 

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:30.070
 and the last note which is 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:32.160
 so in fact empty we normally have to 

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:32.160
 make 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:40.729
 to avoid having to scratch twice 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:43.700
 too fast we're going to go out so let's go 

00:01:40.729 --> 00:01:45.259
 we go on scratch 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.329
 and letting go of the rope and we have 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:50.170
 now a little bit we will do 

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:50.170
 ring the 6 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:02:05.350
 I manage and then we go to the ground and 

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.350
 so 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.680
 what makes chained 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:18.130
 the psy does not sound as strong 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:22.580
 that when in the state manages like that is 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:24.540
 so that gives back and ground then we 

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:29.239
 follow with a minor 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:29.239
 and then so at startup 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:37.580
 for scratching the second rope the rope 

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:40.370
 from empty las that is the basis of 2 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:43.360
 we also have the same effect here for 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.360
 make a little effect anne hurd 

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.360
 so 

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:51.540
 Oh 

00:02:54.080 --> 00:03:06.000
 here I start again and then we go on 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:11.010
 with the lighthouse to make a little effects 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:13.050
 rhythmic the second time that one 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:17.150
 scratch it's all empty strings and 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:17.150
 here we scratch the four middle bodies 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:29.700
 and we start again 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:39.140
 2 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:39.140
 2 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:48.590
 for their 

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:50.310
 the chords are the mjf 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:51.850
 know it 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:55.710
 he swears it 

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:55.710
 that we can make an arpeggio also 

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:03.210
 and 

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:05.480
 2 

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:05.480
 and 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:14.220
 hydro here is at the level of fishing 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.220
 slowly 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:22.239
 a fairly fast passage between the back and 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:22.239
 the g 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:25.020
