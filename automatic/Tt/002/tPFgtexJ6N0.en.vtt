into this since like I tried that first

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.509 
into this since like I tried that first
and<00:00:42.940> then<00:00:43.030> it<00:00:43.120> was<00:00:43.210> pretty<00:00:43.359> bad<00:00:43.510> sound<00:00:43.870> quality

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:11.280 
like the the scratching noise that you
heard<00:03:08.540> earlier<00:03:08.660> was<00:03:09.140> just<00:03:09.440> the<00:03:10.010> jack<00:03:10.280> moving

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:11.290 
heard earlier was just the jack moving

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:15.039 
heard earlier was just the jack moving
so<00:03:12.290> as<00:03:12.590> long<00:03:12.739> as<00:03:12.799> you<00:03:13.100> don't<00:03:14.060> move<00:03:14.480> your<00:03:14.540> laptop

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:15.049

fine
um<00:03:19.050> be<00:03:20.050> careful<00:03:20.560> though<00:03:20.709> if<00:03:21.490> you<00:03:21.760> set<00:03:22.120> your

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:22.150 
um be careful though if you set your

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.839 
um be careful though if you set your
microphone<00:03:22.840> audio<00:03:22.959> too<00:03:23.440> high<00:03:23.620> will<00:03:24.610> I<00:03:24.700> go<00:03:24.819> to

00:03:24.839 --> 00:03:24.849 
microphone audio too high will I go to

00:03:24.849 --> 00:03:26.160 
microphone audio too high will I go to
set<00:03:25.120> up<00:03:25.209> that<00:03:25.330> I<00:03:25.360> have<00:03:25.569> words<00:03:25.840> through<00:03:26.110> a

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 
set up that I have words through a

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:29.640 
set up that I have words through a
microphone<00:03:26.500> port<00:03:27.150> the<00:03:28.150> the<00:03:29.050> audio<00:03:29.290> can<00:03:29.500> get<00:03:29.620> a

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:29.650 
microphone port the the audio can get a

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:31.280 
microphone port the the audio can get a
little<00:03:29.770> scratchy<00:03:30.130> on<00:03:30.370> like<00:03:30.520> the<00:03:30.670> higher<00:03:30.849> notes

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290 
little scratchy on like the higher notes

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:33.960 
little scratchy on like the higher notes
and<00:03:32.290> if<00:03:32.380> you<00:03:32.500> want<00:03:32.680> to<00:03:32.770> fix<00:03:33.010> that<00:03:33.280> you<00:03:33.340> can<00:03:33.730> go

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:33.970 
and if you want to fix that you can go

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:36.809 
and if you want to fix that you can go
and<00:03:34.180> then<00:03:34.270> I<00:03:34.890> think<00:03:35.890> under<00:03:35.980> like<00:03:36.250> mixer<00:03:36.790> or

00:03:36.809 --> 00:03:36.819 
and then I think under like mixer or

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:39.020 
and then I think under like mixer or
something<00:03:37.209> yeah<00:03:37.540> you<00:03:37.600> can<00:03:37.750> change<00:03:37.930> like<00:03:38.080> the

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
something yeah you can change like the

something yeah you can change like the
microphones<00:03:40.470> audio<00:03:41.470> power<00:03:42.750> and<00:03:43.750> blows<00:03:44.730> see

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:45.730 
microphones audio power and blows see

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:51.300 
microphones audio power and blows see
external<00:03:46.120> mic<00:03:46.300> i<00:03:46.450> can<00:03:48.239> put<00:03:49.239> 20<00:03:50.100> works<00:03:51.100> pretty

external mic i can put 20 works pretty

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:57.300 
external mic i can put 20 works pretty
nicely<00:03:52.230> so<00:03:53.230> yeah<00:03:54.780> halo<00:03:55.780> works<00:03:56.080> any<00:03:56.590> game<00:03:57.040> works

00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:57.310
