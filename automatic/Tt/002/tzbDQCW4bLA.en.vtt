00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:16.609
 hello people I consider a very comical 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:23.029
 and sad day 

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:23.029
 because I will border section 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:01:04.550
 now once separated and can now but 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:07.310
 I washed it now for a while and closed it 

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:10.250
 look like cappuccino I think so 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:13.550
 that I had the two years it is 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:15.800
 really no truck so i will 

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:18.860
 now here on disconnect and 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:20.900
 look what it looks like and mine 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.150
 the problem is that they are around here 

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:25.880
 you can see that they are moldy and now 

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:30.830
 Now I'm curious that just 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:33.610
 only here is outside or i will now 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:33.610
 Just go to the 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:55.280
 looks a bit and I am already 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:59.300
 curious if it all just drops off 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:01.369
 or can make up or no 

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:03.950
 I'll just do it now 

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:05.750
 try because I see that 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:07.640
 actually are so pretty and that 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:12.500
 they actually do not have long to 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:13.880
 hair and especially if you have them 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.010
 then washed has because I the 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:17.390
 Research is looking for 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:22.430
 and I would like English 

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:24.560
 did not start so if you have 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.360
 know that you carry in hand that is real 

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.870
 we are not delicious at all 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.870
 a little bit fast 

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.540
 Having lunch 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:58.790
 the result is to blame 

00:02:56.570 --> 00:03:02.660
 and really soft so I will 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:04.490
 then buy me right and so and so 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:06.650
 I already have a few already 

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:10.340
 written off amortized and if I am 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:12.530
 all look at me so this is more than 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:14.800
 disgusting so the mold really 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:14.800
