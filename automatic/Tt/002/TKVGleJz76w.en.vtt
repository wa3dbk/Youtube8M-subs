00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:15.300
 hello in this video another episode 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.850
 who do not want to end in series windows 

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:19.890
 10 make windows more beautiful the new ones 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.110
 applications the so-called apps the 

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.150
 usually come quite gray 

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:28.030
 here shown very briefly that they are more 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:30.340
 or less everything looks gray 

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:32.830
 Microsoft has hidden a possibility 

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:33.310
 built this dark view too 

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:35.230
 to let 

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:36.610
 The trick has been known for a long time 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.470
 and you are originally from it 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:40.300
 assumed that microsoft one 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:41.770
 possibility one builds the whole right 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:44.559
 easy to activate 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:46.480
 Now windows 10 is out 

00:00:44.559 --> 00:00:48.700
 but the necessary switch is the 

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:51.380
 not yet because of that here the whole 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:53.360
 via the registry 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:55.550
 To do this, we first press on windows 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.650
 button and the r button then get the 

00:00:55.550 --> 00:01:00.890
 execute dialog here we carry one 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:03.500
 regedit axis is already with me 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.950
 in it just confirm that here 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:09.140
 also and then we tried to find 

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:13.610
 akita and user 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:17.750
 Software microsoft needs from below 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:19.340
 scroll windows current version yet 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.310
 Scroll down until we get here 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:25.540
 find our topics or like here 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.540
 personal ice cream 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.130
 on the other 

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.510
 Let's take a look with the right one 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.670
 mouse button then I get that 

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:34.130
 Context menu appears that has only one 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.810
 new entry we will get 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.150
 we have a submenu and here we have the 

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:40.700
 possibility to value the word 

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:43.140
 We also make that call 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:48.890
 like rape 

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.890
 deuce whom 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.450
 do not need to change the value of the 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:54.460
 value will automatically be 0 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:57.979
 assigned 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:02:00.680
 namely that the bright theme is no more 

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:02.390
 therefore the whole thing is used with 0 

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:04.789
 so far that would have been it already 

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:07.100
 If I do it all over again 

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:10.259
 then we have the whole call here 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.939
 darker as I said that 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.470
 so will only look at the new windows 

00:02:11.939 --> 00:02:15.420
 applications from so -called 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.129
 apps for example at the computer 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.030
 but if I have the 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:20.030
 google chrome opener 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.820
 there it works 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:26.470
 are not out if they are the whole again 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:28.420
 want to revert simply again 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.280
 open the registry editor here 

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:35.020
 and here either the corresponding one 

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:37.150
 remove entry or just from 0 1 1 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:38.590
 was with a double click all because 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:41.620
 modify and confirm 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.760
 then come that this close and 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:43.120
 it should have been then again 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.900
 his 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.900
 OK
