00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:10.139
 hello girls so today it's 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.590
 this little one does not alert that I'm going to 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:13.950
 show 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:20.580
 I have already laid my base is a varnish 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:21.869
 club color the 963 there are glitter 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.050
 beautiful and you can find it 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:26.880
 at home is that for us to do my 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.400
 flowers I'm going to take an old paintbrush 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:33.090
 to not spoil it in the vergne and a 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:36.270
 sweet sun varnish is called orange 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.230
 so I use the varnish but if 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.250
 you want you can very well from 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.710
 do the acrylic painting 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:47.190
 as long as I put polish on my 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:51.030
 brush and I want to come roughly 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:54.059
 traced my flowers there is no need 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:01:07.890
 to be very precise since after all 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:01:11.010
 will do with the outlines so you do 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.750
 five-petalled flowers and always 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.979
 on the same side in front but here I go 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.259
 now use my painting 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:17.759
 acrylic pbo a thunderstorm a little bit more 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:22.909
 clear that I am I used to the 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.909
 flowers background and montbourg bluff 

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:38.070
 and I will make small strokes that 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:42.439
 leave from the center of the flower and who 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.439
 go out to a typical final 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.759
 so to make traits also do 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.549
 you will need a brush with a boa 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.289
 was done and paint enough 

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:59.429
 fluid 

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:02.069
 I am now going to paint 

00:01:59.429 --> 00:02:04.849
 acrylic and black beret and I'm going 

00:02:02.069 --> 00:02:13.560
 to draw the outline of my flowers so 

00:02:04.849 --> 00:02:18.650
 I support I always release the same 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.650
 of support for the first side I release 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:35.989
 I now take the painting 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:38.940
 yellow acrylic and mondo thing in busan 

00:02:35.989 --> 00:02:43.440
 and I have a yellow tip in the center 

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:49.190
 of my flowers I take back my brush and 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:51.690
 the fra fast antenna and I do the holidays 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:53.840
 sent for leaves makes it a 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:58.549
 little movement to finish a tip 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:58.549
 I then draw the ribs 

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:08.650
 we try anyway you did not do 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:08.650
 in a harmonious way 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:28.239
 then I leave with my painting 

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:28.239
 light orange and I make arabesques 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:39.650
 I take back my host he has eaten and I 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:40.390
 add black hairs join of my 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:43.670
 flowers 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:47.299
 in fact I take a new amount 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:52.370
 be a black painting and I'm going 

00:03:47.299 --> 00:04:05.209
 add a black line on the outline of 

00:03:52.370 --> 00:04:09.109
 manara but in places I added some 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:10.190
 rhinestone I orange but I did not put 

00:04:09.109 --> 00:04:12.350
 especially the fingers because I wanted 

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:14.329
 it's not too busy 

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:16.010
 So that's what it gives I hope that 

00:04:14.329 --> 00:04:20.169
 you liked it and I say to myself 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:20.169
 soon my little idea
