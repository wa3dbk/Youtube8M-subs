00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.740 
it's wet it's going to spread around too
easily<00:04:37.919> and<00:04:38.160> you<00:04:38.430> won't<00:04:38.639> get<00:04:38.790> a<00:04:38.820> nice<00:04:39.060> thick

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:39.750

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:00.409 
expire I would recommend definitely
using<00:04:58.440> it<00:04:58.560> up<00:04:58.680> before<00:04:59.639> the<00:04:59.760> expiration<00:05:00.210> date

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:00.419 
using it up before the expiration date

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:02.780 
using it up before the expiration date
now<00:05:01.229> unlike<00:05:01.530> a<00:05:01.590> lot<00:05:01.830> of<00:05:01.860> lush<00:05:02.100> products<00:05:02.610> but

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:02.790 
now unlike a lot of lush products but

00:05:02.790 --> 00:05:04.430 
now unlike a lot of lush products but
this<00:05:03.210> one<00:05:03.390> you<00:05:03.510> do<00:05:03.600> not<00:05:03.630> have<00:05:03.930> to<00:05:04.050> keep<00:05:04.200> in<00:05:04.350> the

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:04.440 
this one you do not have to keep in the

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:06.650 
this one you do not have to keep in the
fridge<00:05:04.680> and<00:05:05.010> so<00:05:05.160> yes<00:05:05.370> it<00:05:05.520> does<00:05:05.640> expire<00:05:06.060> but

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:06.660 
fridge and so yes it does expire but

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:08.570 
fridge and so yes it does expire but
because<00:05:06.900> of<00:05:06.930> the<00:05:07.140> oils<00:05:07.500> in<00:05:07.680> it<00:05:07.860> that<00:05:08.220> will<00:05:08.400> help

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:08.580 
because of the oils in it that will help

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:10.159 
because of the oils in it that will help
preserve<00:05:08.940> it<00:05:09.210> for<00:05:09.360> that<00:05:09.479> four<00:05:09.750> month<00:05:09.930> time

00:05:10.159 --> 00:05:10.169 
preserve it for that four month time

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:13.370 
preserve it for that four month time
period<00:05:10.490> another<00:05:11.490> recommendation<00:05:11.789> is<00:05:12.660> I<00:05:12.990> would

00:05:13.370 --> 00:05:13.380 
period another recommendation is I would

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:15.740 
period another recommendation is I would
wash<00:05:13.560> any<00:05:13.919> makeup<00:05:14.160> off<00:05:14.490> that<00:05:14.850> you<00:05:15.000> have<00:05:15.240> on

00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:18.950 
your face before applying this mask
because<00:05:18.030> it<00:05:18.060> does<00:05:18.300> not<00:05:18.419> have<00:05:18.630> any<00:05:18.750> makeup

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:18.960 
because it does not have any makeup

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:21.200 
because it does not have any makeup
removers<00:05:19.560> in<00:05:19.740> it<00:05:19.890> it<00:05:20.070> has<00:05:20.250> a<00:05:20.280> lot<00:05:20.460> of<00:05:20.520> oils<00:05:21.000> in

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:21.210 
removers in it it has a lot of oils in

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:23.270 
removers in it it has a lot of oils in
it<00:05:21.300> so<00:05:21.630> if<00:05:21.990> you<00:05:22.200> apply<00:05:22.440> the<00:05:22.500> mask<00:05:22.770> on<00:05:22.950> top<00:05:23.130> of

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:23.280 
it so if you apply the mask on top of

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:24.890 
it so if you apply the mask on top of
your<00:05:23.430> makeup<00:05:23.580> it<00:05:23.850> could<00:05:24.060> trap<00:05:24.330> the<00:05:24.479> makeup<00:05:24.750> in

00:05:24.890 --> 00:05:24.900 
your makeup it could trap the makeup in

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:26.779 
your makeup it could trap the makeup in
your<00:05:24.930> pores<00:05:25.260> and<00:05:25.530> then<00:05:26.130> cause<00:05:26.400> you<00:05:26.580> to<00:05:26.669> break

00:05:26.779 --> 00:05:26.789 
your pores and then cause you to break

00:05:26.789 --> 00:05:29.390 
your pores and then cause you to break
out<00:05:27.060> so<00:05:27.660> make<00:05:27.900> sure<00:05:27.930> your<00:05:28.530> face<00:05:28.710> is<00:05:28.950> clear<00:05:29.250> of
