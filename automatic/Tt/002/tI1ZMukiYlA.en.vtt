mini game server and like I accident

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:27.670 
mini game server and like I accident
accidentally<00:00:24.080> deleted<00:00:25.080> the<00:00:25.740> wrong<00:00:26.010> fouls<00:00:26.430> and

today<00:00:28.680> we<00:00:29.550> got<00:00:29.640> a<00:00:29.699> machine<00:00:30.390> appear<00:00:30.689> in<00:00:30.750> a

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:31.940 
today we got a machine appear in a

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:34.250 
today we got a machine appear in a
stronger<00:00:32.940> machine<00:00:33.390> on<00:00:33.630> server<00:00:33.899> should<00:00:34.140> be

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
stronger machine on server should be

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.650 
stronger machine on server should be
ranch<00:00:34.530> and<00:00:34.680> 32<00:00:35.040> gig<00:00:35.219> of<00:00:35.399> ram<00:00:35.430> back<00:00:35.730> and<00:00:36.030> I'm

of<00:00:40.170> ram<00:00:40.350> I<00:00:40.649> share<00:00:41.219> what<00:00:41.520> I<00:00:41.730> think<00:00:42.510> from<00:00:42.629> beyond

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
of ram I share what I think from beyond

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.850 
of ram I share what I think from beyond
premium<00:00:44.120> it<00:00:45.120> has<00:00:45.450> a<00:00:45.480> stronger<00:00:45.960> processing<00:00:46.710> of

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
premium it has a stronger processing of

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.970 
premium it has a stronger processing of
CPUs<00:00:47.700> at<00:00:47.969> em<00:00:48.239> a<00:00:48.420> lot<00:00:48.600> faster<00:00:48.899> and<00:00:49.260> better<00:00:49.559> so

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
CPUs at em a lot faster and better so

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.250 
CPUs at em a lot faster and better so
the<00:00:50.070> sim<00:00:50.309> should<00:00:50.520> be<00:00:50.610> a<00:00:50.640> lot<00:00:50.879> less<00:00:51.059> laggy<00:00:51.329> I

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
the sim should be a lot less laggy I

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.560 
the sim should be a lot less laggy I
want<00:00:53.129> to<00:00:53.280> make<00:00:53.399> a<00:00:53.430> hub<00:00:53.640> server<00:00:53.940> because<00:00:54.329> those

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
want to make a hub server because those

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.110 
want to make a hub server because those

that just running no one machine I like
in<00:01:40.860> this<00:01:41.009> server<00:01:41.280> just<00:01:42.030> lock<00:01:42.360> in<00:01:42.570> so<00:01:43.439> it's<00:01:43.860> hard

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
in this server just lock in so it's hard

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:49.340 
in this server just lock in so it's hard
it<00:01:44.369> so<00:01:44.970> there's<00:01:45.119> a<00:01:45.210> portal

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:56.870 

and<00:01:49.740> the<00:01:50.700> portals<00:01:51.060> are<00:01:51.150> like<00:01:51.270> that<00:01:52.700> oh<00:01:55.759> this<00:01:56.759> is

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:56.880 
and the portals are like that oh this is

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.109 
and the portals are like that oh this is
my<00:01:57.000> code<00:01:57.210> is<00:01:57.320> everything<00:01:58.320> up<00:01:58.380> so<00:01:59.009> server<00:01:59.820> right

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:00.119 
my code is everything up so server right

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:03.800 
my code is everything up so server right
you<00:02:00.720> go<00:02:00.960> and<00:02:01.380> this<00:02:01.560> thing<00:02:02.360> just<00:02:03.360> like<00:02:03.659> the

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
you go and this thing just like the

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.480 
you go and this thing just like the
techno<00:02:04.170> scrunchies<00:02:04.860> but<00:02:05.159> I<00:02:05.189> didn't

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
techno scrunchies but I didn't

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.059 
techno scrunchies but I didn't
orchestrate<00:02:05.610> I<00:02:06.270> just<00:02:06.450> quit<00:02:06.840> and<00:02:07.020> I<00:02:07.710> need<00:02:07.920> to

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
orchestrate I just quit and I need to

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:10.249 
orchestrate I just quit and I need to
reset<00:02:08.459> the<00:02:08.729> map<00:02:08.910> and<00:02:09.209> make<00:02:09.390> a<00:02:09.420> new<00:02:09.690> map<00:02:09.869> because

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
reset the map and make a new map because

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:11.890 
reset the map and make a new map because
the<00:02:10.440> hub<00:02:10.619> and<00:02:10.800> everything<00:02:11.100> was<00:02:11.220> gone<00:02:11.489> already

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
the hub and everything was gone already

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:23.240 
the hub and everything was gone already
so<00:02:12.900> this<00:02:13.470> is<00:02:13.590> how<00:02:13.770> it<00:02:13.890> is<00:02:21.170> the<00:02:22.170> new<00:02:22.350> pure<00:02:22.620> you

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
so this is how it is the new pure you

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:25.040 
so this is how it is the new pure you
press<00:02:23.459> tab<00:02:23.730> is<00:02:23.970> only<00:02:24.120> one<00:02:24.300> person<00:02:24.510> on<00:02:24.720> and<00:02:24.989> I

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
press tab is only one person on and I

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:30.920 
press tab is only one person on and I
especially<00:02:25.730> no<00:02:27.200> no<00:02:29.269> yeah<00:02:30.269> that's<00:02:30.569> how<00:02:30.690> it<00:02:30.720> goes

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:30.930 
especially no no yeah that's how it goes

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:33.020 
especially no no yeah that's how it goes
