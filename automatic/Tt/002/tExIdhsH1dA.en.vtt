00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.269
 Welcome, how are you? 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:27.259
 and here we are again with you 

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:29.840
 to share you on the subject of 

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:32.180
 questions and answers the striking yes 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.340
 well first I would like to tell us that 

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.989
 if we speak from doubling there is a 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.269
 original question that starts the 

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:40.780
 unfolding then there is a 

00:00:38.269 --> 00:00:42.760
 response that closes it 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:46.149
 when talking about questions and answers 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:48.430
 We say that the answers are already 

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:51.160
 beforehand and in that we can quote the 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:53.500
 example of the web crawler 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:55.690
 answers are from the other side and I do 

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:59.409
 the question to get an answer 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:01.739
 as if it were a fishhook looking for that 

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:01.739
 answer 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.299
 it seems very nice to me, so 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:08.900
 Came a little more to our processes 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.900
 personal 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:13.469
 well first say that in the before 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.569
 the personal processes and that also 

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:18.869
 they go in personal processes is that 

00:01:15.569 --> 00:01:21.479
 you have to know how to ask yourself why 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:23.670
 the answers are there you have to know which 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.090
 is the question a good question has 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:29.090
 a good answer 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:31.159
 and good and in personal processes 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:34.009
 as we had seen in the many videos 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:35.840
 Sometimes there are people that we refuse 

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:38.600
 some way or we all have moments 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:42.810
 but we started this physical plane the 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:46.560
 unfolding we reject 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:50.700
 because we have a memory of a place 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:54.299
 more harmonious and so on but we can not 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:57.750
 access that question because no 

00:01:54.299 --> 00:02:03.370
 we assume that we have taken the 

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:05.410
 decision to unfold not us 

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:10.080
 and we have made the decision to double 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:13.080
 it means that we made ourselves the 

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.080
 original 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:20.549
 we asked ourselves the question of how it would not be 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:24.299
 be what I am clear and I have to start 

00:02:20.549 --> 00:02:27.060
 by assuming that to then be able to 

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:31.170
 finding the way back home is 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:34.440
 clear because if I do not recognize that I chose 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:38.069
 and give me home to experience what I do not 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:40.370
 was I can not find the answer that 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:43.400
 he returns me home 

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:46.080
 That 's right 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:52.940
 as we speak is a matter of 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:52.940
 Exact decision to choose 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:03:00.300
 that we talk about when we talk about 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:05.160
 questions when I do not assume that decision and 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:10.770
 It also happens that as I have that memory 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:14.190
 original does not ask me if and that 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:16.420
 it means that I do not want to commit 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:18.910
 mistakes 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:21.819
 because if we talk about how it would not be 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:24.520
 be what I am 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:27.040
 then I will experience what is not 

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:29.380
 and all these as well as the errors are 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.810
 those who bring the questions and then 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:34.450
 I see mistakes as my elders 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:37.720
 enemies when in fact the mistakes 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:39.570
 my best friends are the ones who 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:42.570
 they inform and make you aware 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:42.570
 justly 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:48.830
 how the perspective changes truth that 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:52.110
 it is also extremely important 

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:54.480
 become aware of the error or not 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:58.230
 resist us 

00:03:54.480 --> 00:04:01.500
 well one thing leads to the other if I accept 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:05.760
 I chose to leave I can accept the error 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:08.489
 because it is part of this path for 

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:12.239
 be able to return on the way back 

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:15.420
 it's over I chose it and it organizes everything I 

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:17.430
 This trip 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:19.730
 experience 

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:24.070
 well then 

00:04:19.730 --> 00:04:24.070
 it seems to me that for another day we are talking 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:30.100
 we are making progress 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:34.240
 Well, thanks for being there 

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:34.240
 accompanying accompanying 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:38.480
 see you 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.150
 Y 

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:44.630
 ah 

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.090
 ah 

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:07.110
 i
