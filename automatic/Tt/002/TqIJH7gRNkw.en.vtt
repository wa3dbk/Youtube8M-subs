00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:09.599

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.460

 consoles and orient one is mine but that 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.740
 is from álex that has left me very 

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:19.860
 kindly since it was the week 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:22.200
 spent on a trip in Sweden where no 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:24.480
 I could go because I 'll tell you now 

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.740
 I was preparing my little things to go 

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:29.130
 a main context with him serving this 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.210
 video I will be on the way to florida and 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.890
 that same thing I could not record any 

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:34.980
 video since in Europe it is the game 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.140
 just today 31 and the USA in the game 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.579
 On the 28th, I could not play like that 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.320
 that's good if I get something during the 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.370
 trip then upload something else if not 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:43.559
 you will have to wait until the return 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.420
 unfortunately so like 6 well 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.519

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.260
 generation of consoles the truth that is 

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:51.269
 delighted by her of this event but 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.679

00:00:52.679 --> 00:00:56.789
 what they call you in their channel because yes 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.559
 which is a machine in fact was the one 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.449
 He told me that the first of all of the 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.460
 Lice forgiveness all day in all 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:04.710
 platforms that they played so he left ready 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.390
 now and espanyol very very high and the 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.930
 they were carrying on him saying mother 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:12.120
 from where it came out he said the super truth 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.460
 happy to be able to try to play this 

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:16.320
 Game game I played the alpha version 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.200
 We met the e3 on other trips as has 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.180
 been also in the euro gamers the no 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.280
 sorry for james with we build in 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:25.020
 Germany in Cologne a lot of events 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.090
 However, he could not play the version 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.100
 final and now that I would love to 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.479
 all can see it no longer so much with the 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.009
 new people I'm curious the 

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:34.740
 truth I 'm not going to cheat but yes 

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:36.570
 I would like to see it in I started because 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:38.460
 oysters this game the final version 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.410
 I started has inner authentic wonder 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.410
 although certainly according to what alex told me 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:45.270
 in precision 40 in a bestial way 

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:47.250
 amazing so good how it served a 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:49.890
 Chimera perform it the highest quality that 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:51.479
 can so you can appreciate it but 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.100
 As I tell you , we'll see when I 'm in 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.330
 consoles we practically have 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:57.000
 doing optimized let's leave in 

00:01:54.330 --> 00:02:00.300
 those 15 days a month practically yes 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.280
 we consider here in europe and as 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.840
 I tell you super happy that this game 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.940
 have finally come out are games that 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.320
 I was also waiting quite a lot 

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.119
 comes far from the levels at 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.619
 that I had before hype with all the 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.390
 shooters but nevertheless yes that is a 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.170
 game in which playing with friends is 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:16.560
 of those that better 

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:18.300
 the goal is not if I played 20 hours something like that 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.010
 in the days that he was there and in fact 

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.440
 it was all-day practices every day 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.810
 but in all the plays in the 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:27.300
 first 23 days so the game 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:28.890
 I did not spend very well and especially 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.940
 Well, the theme that was a game 

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.440
 totally different I do not want that 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:33.150
 start fighting that exists better than 

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:35.190
 follow the white sox like the call of 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.989
 duty or game is the game that is like 

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.610
 I say the truth is that it gives you enough 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:40.920
 the same as long as I always want 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:42.090
 I just tried to have less we will 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.220
 play a game because he only wants 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.810
 is to entertain so I do not want that 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.160
 start to fight that if a game of 

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.720
 better job what I'm going to upload a 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.819
 thing I will raise the other in fact 

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.910
 surely upload a video being a 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:55.680
 little thing that they have brought to me and in addition 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.870
 will also serve to do as the 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:59.549
 channel application and and that kind of 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:01.860
 things that I want to tell the 

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:04.019
 things as I tell you the battlefield 4 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.610
 according to what has been counted and for some action 

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:08.220
 had when he was Juan Díaz document 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:11.190
 the videos that I got from the truth but 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.150
 it's just that the truth is that it's 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:14.080
 a wonder is not like being 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.650
 practically the war 

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.760
 practically as you know they have 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:18.740
 Dedicated servers although this year 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.420
 they also have the color beauty and 

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:22.880
 Well the truth is that it is a game which 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:24.500
 playing just cool but I think it was 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:26.240
 Some friends is an experience 

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:29.360
 incredible and more than anything because it's a lot 

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:31.220
 more of shopping and saying continue on 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:33.140
 team and well we would say basically that 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:35.570
 it's a lot to follow the team and in fact 

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:37.070
 the most important things that you have to 

00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:38.810
 to do in this game is obviously 

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:40.370
 How do I tell you to play with your classmates? 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:42.080
 fact indeed this game starts 

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.459
 playing bad company 2 and it was 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:45.560
 practically because you could go 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:47.360
 with your classmates and so on and how are you going 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.010
 to see during the next days when 

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:51.530
 already huelva and I 'll go to different gameplay 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:52.790
 chronicles and to record and play as there is a 

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:54.920
 Lots of maps which as 

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:56.600
 flood that let's say things happen 

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:59.690
 that would happen the best in any 

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:01.400
 another type of event not well every game 

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:03.020
 each map there are different things to do 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:04.850
 and also the map totally change by 

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:06.709
 completely remember is that the map of the 

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:09.200
 beta change since there is a building in 

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:11.390
 others there are floods that make the 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:13.400
 map is virtually different than 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:14.690
 that we had previously seen in 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:17.180
 function of the game modes changes the 

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:18.590
 map also put more less tanks 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:19.790
 also depending on the platforms 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:21.440
 there are more or less players 

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:22.610
 is a game can be adapted 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:24.800
 practically so that it goes the best 

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:27.920
 possible on each platform be both 

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.390
 be cc as if that console is 

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:31.790
 generation next generation 

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:34.550
 whatever it is so good as I say 

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:35.570
 quite satisfied that they read 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:36.740
 because in this game and in says a 

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:39.320
 week the new games 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:41.390
 generations and finally see how 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:43.640
 they yield not because up to now matters 

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:46.580
 they had seen games that send you this way 

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:48.410
 played at watts dogs in this 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:51.350
 generation of consoles in the application 

00:04:48.410 --> 00:04:53.360
 4 but also as I tell you I have not 

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:54.620
 tried shooters or play them online that 

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:56.720
 is the eye of what interests me the most 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:57.650
 since these games are actually 

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:00.140
 generation I think it's going to be everything 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:03.590
 practically online games those that go 

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:06.230
 to tighten them internally for that very reason 

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:07.670
 the people would drive out x I do not know how many 

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:09.920
 numbers servers features what 

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:12.350
 better was possible fluid and as I say 

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:14.630
 that is everything more focused on the last 

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:16.160
 to multiplayer online so that people 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:17.810
 of the biggest bed experience no less the 

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:20.000
 mine that they are also advancing 

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:22.010
 connections in let's say all the 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.390
 countries from here to wet to ten years is 

00:05:22.010 --> 00:05:27.520
 something normal that does not have 50 to 100 megabytes 

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:29.080
 is what most affects when playing 

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:31.420
 the multi power mode and more in this case 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:33.070
 as they are shooter so good as been 

00:05:31.420 --> 00:05:34.390
 I hope you liked this book and 

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:35.950
 thank you very much we passed through your 

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:38.620
 channel because now it's that he threw me a 

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:40.360
 hand to bring osio gameplay from 

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:41.740
 this game that not although I could not 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:44.170
 play it for the moment the final version 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:45.550
 because being on a trip and nothing said 

00:05:44.170 --> 00:05:50.100
 I only hope everyone likes the 

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:50.100
 video and see you next goodbye
