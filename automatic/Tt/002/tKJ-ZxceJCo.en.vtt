00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:04.930
 hello welcome to a new good video 

00:00:02.499 --> 00:00:08.290
 Today I am going to talk and I am going to comment on 

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:10.360
 definitive notice my experience but 

00:00:08.290 --> 00:00:13.320
 three months later as you will know 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:15.249
 A couple of months ago a video went up 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:19.230
 telling them that he had bought a 

00:00:15.249 --> 00:00:23.400
 definitive smoothing on the internet was this 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:25.710
 if it's from the brand evans with lime aroma or 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:28.320
 lima and the strong and strong line 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.380
 means strong comes in black container 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.960
 of red cap back is of the 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.390
 Introductions is a definitive smoothing 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.699
 and the brand has nothing to do with the 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:42.150
 keratin is promoted in 

00:00:38.699 --> 00:00:45.430
 markama evans television but that 

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:47.620
 this is a definitive smoothing 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:50.410
 then not briefly to comment 

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:53.950
 I've been three months as the smoothed 

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:56.500
 you will see you can see my hair 

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:59.710
 it was pretty straight I had a second 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:02.020
 side still lasts me 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:04.629
 good the first months the first month 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:07.740
 I was incredibly straight and good and 

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:12.130
 with the passing of the months 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:13.780
 decreasing a bit and being super straight if 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:16.880
 well it does not go back to being a bent like 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:19.350
 before but neither is 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:23.280
 too straight or with the same effect 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:26.130
 that the first month I think the fact 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:30.510
 that lasts three to four months or six 

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:33.660
 months as he promises is quite positive 

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:35.790
 matches this and not because 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:38.940
 it coincides because it is still in the head 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:42.040
 lacio is still activated with the dryer 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:44.390
 zoo with drying and I have left 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:48.170
 a semi straight 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:50.060
 and because it's not as durable as 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:53.810
 programete and because it is not like the 

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:57.710
 first day of course this with him 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:02:00.200
 the washing and continuous let's say goes 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:03.970
 wearing out like that seems like a 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:06.439
 very effective product in relation 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:10.250
 price-quality you can try it in several 

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:12.830
 hair types I tried on straight hair yes 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.989
 the truth that gives a super straight I tried it 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.760
 but they have doubled me like mine and 

00:02:14.989 --> 00:02:20.099
 the action is really enough 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:23.340
 and also with respect to the product 

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:25.739
 contains a minimum percentage of formaldehyde 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:30.239
 I can tell you that my hair was left 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:32.520
 much more defined without frizz although already 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:35.750
 three months have passed 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:38.220
 I do not do it on my hair I tried it on hairs 

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:40.620
 platinum or very blond or very 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.980
 red and the truth that does not ruin or 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:45.870
 burn in each kiss that is a myth 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:48.090
 it really originates from brazil the 

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:51.660
 product comes for a liter so they 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:53.550
 can yield up to 810 enrolled and good 

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:57.650
 the truth that has been a great solution 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:03:01.620
 for me I 'm keeping it with 

00:02:57.650 --> 00:03:03.750
 a volume and zante product that are 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:05.970
 products that take out the volume and 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:09.360
 they eliminate the frizz they have another video there 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:12.900
 recent where he explained this product in 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:16.410
 the title keratin treatments and what 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:18.840
 What I do is apply a cream bath 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:22.370
 a nutrition once a week so 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:25.459
 well really it is highly recommended 

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:27.519
 if you want to ask for it, you can 

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:30.470
 search in mercadolibre here in argentina 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:33.590
 it has to be from the strong line like 

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:35.209
 she explains it comes in three lime aromas 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:38.239
 like this that I have with a lemon 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:40.930
 has the chocolate and comes apple yes or 

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:43.819
 if they ask for the one that says strong for 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:47.310
 make sure it is the strongest or the one that 

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:49.380
 contains a percentage of the fund 

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:51.599
 I hope that any 

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:52.950
 you can write me and really if 

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:55.770
 have the possibility to buy it 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:57.480
 buy it because it works works very 

00:03:55.770 --> 00:04:00.300
 well and the truth is that they save a lot 

00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:01.920
 money in the hairdresser good hands 

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:04.489
 something all and until next time 

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.489
 bye Bye
