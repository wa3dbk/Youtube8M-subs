easily the way this guy works is you
have<00:00:36.490> your<00:00:36.700> input<00:00:37.120> for<00:00:37.300> the<00:00:37.690> mp3<00:00:38.200> player<00:00:38.340> you

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:39.340 
have your input for the mp3 player you

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:42.060 
have your input for the mp3 player you
have<00:00:39.579> a<00:00:39.850> ground<00:00:40.390> pin<00:00:40.810> coming<00:00:41.200> off<00:00:41.350> you<00:00:41.920> could

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:42.070 
have a ground pin coming off you could

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:44.040 
have a ground pin coming off you could
say<00:00:42.220> the<00:00:42.340> bottom<00:00:42.700> and<00:00:42.880> then<00:00:43.600> you<00:00:43.630> have<00:00:43.810> to

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:44.050 
say the bottom and then you have to

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:47.400 
say the bottom and then you have to
signal<00:00:44.320> pins<00:00:44.680> coming<00:00:45.010> off<00:00:45.250> the<00:00:45.700> back<00:00:46.410> signal

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:47.410 
signal pins coming off the back signal

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:49.710 
signal pins coming off the back signal
one<00:00:47.560> in<00:00:47.739> signal<00:00:48.100> to<00:00:48.280> are<00:00:48.550> just<00:00:48.610> left<00:00:49.390> and<00:00:49.570> right

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:49.720 
one in signal to are just left and right

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.380 
one in signal to are just left and right
speaker<00:00:50.200> so<00:00:50.980> in<00:00:51.370> your<00:00:51.520> XM<00:00:51.880> module<00:00:52.239> you're

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:52.390 
speaker so in your XM module you're

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:54.389 
speaker so in your XM module you're
going<00:00:52.510> to<00:00:52.600> have<00:00:52.720> two<00:00:52.960> wires<00:00:53.200> that<00:00:53.829> control<00:00:54.250> the

00:00:54.389 --> 00:00:54.399 
going to have two wires that control the

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:56.490 
going to have two wires that control the
left<00:00:54.610> and<00:00:54.820> right<00:00:54.970> speakers<00:00:55.480> and<00:00:55.780> you<00:00:56.260> need<00:00:56.440> to

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:56.500 
left and right speakers and you need to

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.160 
left and right speakers and you need to
tap<00:00:56.680> into<00:00:56.890> those<00:00:57.160> and<00:00:57.460> attach<00:00:58.059> the<00:00:58.480> signal<00:00:58.989> one

00:00:59.160 --> 00:00:59.170 
tap into those and attach the signal one

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.120 
tap into those and attach the signal one
and<00:00:59.410> signal<00:00:59.800> two<00:01:00.010> to<00:01:00.670> the<00:01:00.760> left<00:01:00.790> and<00:01:01.149> right<00:01:02.130> so

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:03.130 
and signal two to the left and right so

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:04.679 
and signal two to the left and right so
I'm<00:01:03.219> going<00:01:03.399> to<00:01:03.430> start<00:01:03.790> off<00:01:03.910> by<00:01:03.940> soldering<00:01:04.420> a

00:01:04.679 --> 00:01:04.689 
I'm going to start off by soldering a

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:14.190 
I'm going to start off by soldering a
wire<00:01:04.930> onto<00:01:05.199> each<00:01:05.469> signal<00:01:05.979> pin

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:14.200 

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.410 

then<00:01:14.710> I'll<00:01:14.860> solder<00:01:15.130> a<00:01:15.250> wire<00:01:15.400> onto<00:01:15.880> the<00:01:16.150> ground

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:16.420 
then I'll solder a wire onto the ground

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:22.270 
then I'll solder a wire onto the ground
pin

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:22.280 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.490 

to<00:01:23.060> finish<00:01:23.240> that<00:01:23.480> up<00:01:23.660> I'm<00:01:23.810> going<00:01:23.990> to<00:01:24.080> paint<00:01:24.320> on

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:24.500 
to finish that up I'm going to paint on

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.830 
to finish that up I'm going to paint on
some<00:01:24.740> of<00:01:24.860> this<00:01:24.950> nifty<00:01:25.250> liquid<00:01:26.210> electrical

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:26.840 
some of this nifty liquid electrical

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.050 
some of this nifty liquid electrical
tape<00:01:27.080> covers<00:01:27.650> up<00:01:27.800> all<00:01:28.040> the<00:01:28.160> solder<00:01:28.400> joints<00:01:28.880> and

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 
tape covers up all the solder joints and

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:38.389 
tape covers up all the solder joints and
dries<00:01:29.570> in<00:01:29.750> about<00:01:29.810> five<00:01:30.290> to<00:01:30.320> ten<00:01:30.710> minutes

00:01:38.389 --> 00:01:38.399 

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:40.520 

one<00:01:39.000> thing<00:01:39.179> to<00:01:39.299> keep<00:01:39.450> in<00:01:39.600> mind<00:01:39.659> when<00:01:40.229> soldering

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
one thing to keep in mind when soldering

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.050 
one thing to keep in mind when soldering
your<00:01:40.829> wires<00:01:41.009> on<00:01:41.250> is<00:01:41.460> make<00:01:41.700> sure<00:01:41.729> you<00:01:42.030> have

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
your wires on is make sure you have

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.999 
your wires on is make sure you have
enough<00:01:42.450> length<00:01:42.750> to<00:01:42.899> reach<00:01:43.320> where<00:01:43.560> you<00:01:43.679> want<00:01:43.890> it

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
enough length to reach where you want it

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.099 
enough length to reach where you want it
to<00:01:44.189> I<00:01:44.399> had<00:01:44.789> a<00:01:44.820> lot<00:01:45.060> of<00:01:45.090> extra<00:01:45.390> lengths<00:01:45.719> and<00:01:45.960> I

00:01:46.099 --> 00:01:46.109 
to I had a lot of extra lengths and I

00:01:46.109 --> 00:01:47.809 
to I had a lot of extra lengths and I
just<00:01:46.320> cut<00:01:46.500> it<00:01:46.530> off<00:01:46.799> but<00:01:47.130> I<00:01:47.159> didn't<00:01:47.460> have<00:01:47.549> to<00:01:47.670> add

00:01:47.809 --> 00:01:47.819 
just cut it off but I didn't have to add

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:50.029 
just cut it off but I didn't have to add
any<00:01:48.090> more<00:01:48.179> wire<00:01:48.509> now<00:01:49.170> that<00:01:49.350> we've<00:01:49.469> created<00:01:49.649> the
