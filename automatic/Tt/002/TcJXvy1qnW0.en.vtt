00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
 yes 

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:04.620
 the 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:13.420
 and 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:16.740
 true 

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:28.220
 hello friends today we are going to make a big 

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.340
 brawn and that is a cake and is very in 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:33.330
 vogue 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.910
 American and we need those 

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:38.390
 following ingredients 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:43.370
 sugar and chocolate chocolate 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:47.780
 fondant the eggs the butter the 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:51.270
 flour and nuts and also 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:55.760
 a little bit of liquid vanilla 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.760
 and a tiny bit of salt 

00:00:56.079 --> 00:01:04.110
 first of all we will put the amount 

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:04.110
 for editing it's fine 

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.510
 when we already have the butter that 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:17.010
 It is undoing us 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:17.010
 we will put the chocolate 

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.549
 a couple of times 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.420
 yes 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:36.500
 we will be stirring well 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:39.750
 to the river always and of all canada 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:43.070
 when you have felt the chocolate 

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.070
 for the fire 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:49.500
 and then hit 

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:58.000
 never stop stirring 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.000
 well with the energy 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.830
 We have once already integrated the sugar 

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.440
 let's let temper have to be a 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:11.930
 bit cold 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:16.250
 well we have already tempered the chocolate 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:18.460
 and now we will add the eggs first 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.460
 3 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.260
 although he leaves these groups 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.970
 already delivered yet 

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:40.739
 2 and also 

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.739
 let's beat well 

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:47.710
 and then 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:51.459
 it's a soup spoon 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.010
 and we will continue beating 

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:09.200
 the salt 

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:14.980
 we are going to sift it as always 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.069
 Once we have sifted the flour 

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.910
 stirring 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.879
 very well shakes 

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.750
 and finally we will put the nuts that 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:56.890
 we see them 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.900
 previously we have cut them a little bit 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:01.240
 so that they are not so big we have 

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:02.930
 reserved some because they are 

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:06.250
 we will put over 

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:06.250
 we throw the nuts there 

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:12.860
 and we follow the governments 

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:12.860
 so that they are distributed well 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:19.840
 we have delayed the mold a little 

00:04:17.109 --> 00:04:22.750
 these are disposable with a little 

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:25.660
 butter and we will also put a 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:29.520
 little bit of flour to keep it from 

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:33.530
 hit us and then 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.530
 where we saw the whole mass of the crawley 

00:04:35.620 --> 00:04:43.740
 an average we have it we give you some 

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:43.740
 taps for bubbles to come out 

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:51.120
 and finally 

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:54.360
 we will put some nuts 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:57.979
 for decoration here we have our 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:05:03.860
 road and now we will pass it to the oven at 180 

00:04:57.979 --> 00:05:03.860
 degrees above and below to cook 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:11.849
 this has to give a little bit raw no 

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:15.270
 it has to be very very very cooked 

00:05:11.849 --> 00:05:18.770
 35 minutes have passed and now we are going to 

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:18.770
 see how our brown is 

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:24.620
 think because they have to give a little 

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:27.590
 crude from the center 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:30.020
 we put the toothpick and other 

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:32.860
 times they have to give dry this truth is 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:35.540
 that goes a little wet is perfect 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:38.260
 because it does not have to be too much 

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:38.260
 parched 

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:45.160
 we'll let it cool and we can 

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:48.390
 unmold 

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:52.000
 good friends here we have our loud and 

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:55.020
 I hope that when you do, it will come out so 

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.020
 good like this
