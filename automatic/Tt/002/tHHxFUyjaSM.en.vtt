actual pastry not hard container to the

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.729 
actual pastry not hard container to the
same<00:03:07.610> thing<00:03:07.819> so<00:03:08.030> these<00:03:08.569> have<00:03:08.900> the<00:03:09.110> same<00:03:09.140> amount

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:09.739 
same thing so these have the same amount

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:11.350 
same thing so these have the same amount
of<00:03:09.799> calories<00:03:10.099> with<00:03:10.640> the<00:03:10.819> ones<00:03:11.030> with<00:03:11.329> a

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:11.360 
of calories with the ones with a

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.789 
of calories with the ones with a
chocolate<00:03:11.870> frosting<00:03:14.019> okay<00:03:15.019> so<00:03:15.079> these<00:03:15.470> don't

00:03:15.789 --> 00:03:15.799 
chocolate frosting okay so these don't

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:18.190 
chocolate frosting okay so these don't
have<00:03:16.010> any<00:03:16.040> frosting<00:03:16.880> at<00:03:17.030> all<00:03:17.209> looks<00:03:18.019> like<00:03:18.049> a

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
have any frosting at all looks like a

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:20.050 
have any frosting at all looks like a
sugar<00:03:18.560> crystals<00:03:18.980> well<00:03:19.130> they<00:03:19.310> do<00:03:19.370> they<00:03:19.850> have

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:20.060 
sugar crystals well they do they have

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.900 
sugar crystals well they do they have
sugar<00:03:20.269> crystals<00:03:20.810> on<00:03:21.019> them<00:03:21.109> but<00:03:21.380> I<00:03:21.980> find<00:03:22.700> it

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:22.910 
sugar crystals on them but I find it

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:24.370 
sugar crystals on them but I find it
interesting<00:03:23.299> that<00:03:23.630> these<00:03:24.019> have<00:03:24.200> the<00:03:24.350> same

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:24.380 
interesting that these have the same

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:27.610 
interesting that these have the same
amount<00:03:24.889> of<00:03:24.950> calories<00:03:25.180> without<00:03:26.180> any<00:03:26.810> chocolate

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620 
amount of calories without any chocolate

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:32.080 
amount of calories without any chocolate
on<00:03:27.739> top<00:03:28.599> so<00:03:29.650> open<00:03:30.650> this<00:03:30.859> and<00:03:31.220> once<00:03:31.639> again<00:03:31.910> it's

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:32.090 
on top so open this and once again it's

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:36.569 
on top so open this and once again it's
very<00:03:32.180> soft<00:03:33.849> that<00:03:34.849> came<00:03:35.120> apart<00:03:35.510> very<00:03:36.319> easily

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:36.579 
very soft that came apart very easily

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:47.280 
very soft that came apart very easily
not<00:03:37.579> crispy<00:03:38.239> like<00:03:38.450> a<00:03:38.480> regular<00:03:38.750> pop<00:03:39.169> tart

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.290 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:51.449 

it's<00:03:47.830> good<00:03:48.189> I<00:03:49.590> like<00:03:50.590> the<00:03:50.769> one<00:03:50.920> with<00:03:51.069> the<00:03:51.129> chop

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:51.459 
it's good I like the one with the chop

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:53.250 
it's good I like the one with the chop
on<00:03:51.640> top<00:03:51.670> better<00:03:52.209> because<00:03:52.629> he<00:03:52.750> gave<00:03:52.930> it<00:03:53.110> more

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260 
on top better because he gave it more

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.259 
on top better because he gave it more
flavor<00:03:53.620> the<00:03:54.010> chocolate<00:03:54.489> for<00:03:54.730> me<00:03:54.879> definitely

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:55.269 
flavor the chocolate for me definitely

00:03:55.269 --> 00:04:00.330 
flavor the chocolate for me definitely
added<00:03:55.870> more<00:03:56.200> flavor<00:03:57.060> it's<00:03:58.060> good<00:03:59.040> nice<00:04:00.040> and

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:00.340 
added more flavor it's good nice and

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.170 
added more flavor it's good nice and
soft<00:04:01.799> can<00:04:02.799> taste<00:04:02.980> like<00:04:03.069> a<00:04:03.189> sugar<00:04:03.549> cookie<00:04:03.819> but

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:04.180 
soft can taste like a sugar cookie but

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:05.729 
soft can taste like a sugar cookie but
with<00:04:04.299> peanut<00:04:04.599> butter<00:04:04.629> like<00:04:05.409> that's<00:04:05.590> the

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:05.739 
with peanut butter like that's the

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:09.149 
with peanut butter like that's the
texture<00:04:06.159> it<00:04:06.370> gives<00:04:06.579> yeah<00:04:07.030> definitely<00:04:07.950> but<00:04:08.950> now

00:04:09.149 --> 00:04:09.159 
texture it gives yeah definitely but now

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:12.690 
texture it gives yeah definitely but now
this<00:04:09.930> these<00:04:10.930> without<00:04:11.500> the<00:04:11.829> chocolate<00:04:12.040> I<00:04:12.370> would

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:12.700 
this these without the chocolate I would

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:16.080 
this these without the chocolate I would
not<00:04:12.909> necessarily<00:04:13.090> buy<00:04:13.780> again<00:04:14.670> the<00:04:15.670> chocolate

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:16.090 
not necessarily buy again the chocolate

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:18.090 
not necessarily buy again the chocolate
ones<00:04:16.269> for<00:04:16.510> me<00:04:16.630> I<00:04:16.660> were<00:04:16.959> by<00:04:17.169> their<00:04:17.440> yeah<00:04:17.829> they

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:19.600 
were better the ones with the chocolate

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.270 
were better the ones with the chocolate
were<00:04:19.720> definitely<00:04:20.139> better<00:04:20.440> if<00:04:20.889> he's<00:04:21.100> at

00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:21.280

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:46.750 

these<00:04:45.470> are<00:04:45.650> bland<00:04:45.980> compared<00:04:46.520> to<00:04:46.639> the

00:04:46.750 --> 00:04:46.760 
these are bland compared to the

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:49.110 
these are bland compared to the
chocolate<00:04:47.150> ones<00:04:47.360> I<00:04:47.540> mean<00:04:47.750> they're<00:04:47.960> really<00:04:48.110> I

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:52.300 
mean they have a little bit of a peanut
flavor<00:04:51.410> but<00:04:51.620> they<00:04:51.710> don't<00:04:51.860> have<00:04:51.980> a<00:04:52.010> strong

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:52.310 
flavor but they don't have a strong

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:53.950 
flavor but they don't have a strong
peanut<00:04:52.760> butter<00:04:52.880> flavor<00:04:53.120> it's<00:04:53.389> very<00:04:53.720> very

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:53.960 
peanut butter flavor it's very very

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.070 
peanut butter flavor it's very very
light<00:04:54.220> the<00:04:55.220> chocolate<00:04:55.669> one

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:56.080 
light the chocolate one

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:00.040 
light the chocolate one
definitely<00:04:57.080> 100%<00:04:57.260> better<00:04:57.889> if<00:04:58.760> I<00:04:58.970> have<00:04:59.870> to<00:04:59.960> be

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:00.050 
definitely 100% better if I have to be

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:02.170 
definitely 100% better if I have to be
honest<00:05:00.320> I'm<00:05:00.440> not<00:05:00.470> a<00:05:00.590> huge<00:05:01.130> pop<00:05:01.340> art<00:05:01.580> fan<00:05:01.760> anyway
