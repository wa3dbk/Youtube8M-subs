that<00:02:28.350> that<00:02:28.740> horse<00:02:28.950> is<00:02:29.040> nice<00:02:29.310> and<00:02:29.520> long<00:02:29.670> in<00:02:30.030> that

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
that that horse is nice and long in that

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.440 
that that horse is nice and long in that
and<00:02:31.170> I<00:02:31.620> have<00:02:31.890> some<00:02:32.100> bracketry<00:02:32.910> you<00:02:33.000> can<00:02:33.150> see<00:02:33.330> it

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:33.450 
and I have some bracketry you can see it

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.540 
and I have some bracketry you can see it
so<00:02:33.570> let's<00:02:33.690> just<00:02:33.840> connect<00:02:34.200> it<00:02:34.320> on<00:02:34.410> the<00:02:34.470> bottom

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:35.550 
so let's just connect it on the bottom

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.450 
so let's just connect it on the bottom
they'll<00:02:35.970> be<00:02:36.090> brackets<00:02:36.480> across<00:02:36.780> the<00:02:36.960> top<00:02:37.460> and

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:38.460 
they'll be brackets across the top and

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.280 
they'll be brackets across the top and
the<00:02:38.820> radio<00:02:39.120> is<00:02:39.180> just<00:02:39.480> back<00:02:39.690> strapped<00:02:40.080> in<00:02:40.260> with

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
the radio is just back strapped in with

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:42.620 
the radio is just back strapped in with
three<00:02:40.890> or<00:02:40.980> four<00:02:41.130> back<00:02:41.310> straps<00:02:41.700> there<00:02:42.000> and

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630 
three or four back straps there and

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.260 
three or four back straps there and
that's<00:02:43.010> basically<00:02:44.010> to<00:02:44.190> keep<00:02:44.340> it<00:02:44.490> in<00:02:44.610> place

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:45.270 
that's basically to keep it in place

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:48.740 
that's basically to keep it in place
while<00:02:45.810> I<00:02:46.220> make<00:02:47.220> the<00:02:47.250> the<00:02:47.970> sraw<00:02:48.210> because<00:02:48.570> over

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
while I make the the sraw because over

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:50.210 
while I make the the sraw because over
the<00:02:48.840> whole<00:02:48.930> thing<00:02:49.170> it'll<00:02:49.800> actually<00:02:50.010> be

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:50.220 
the whole thing it'll actually be

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.100 
the whole thing it'll actually be
attached<00:02:50.460> to<00:02:50.730> the<00:02:50.820> straw<00:02:51.060> audible<00:02:51.900> to<00:02:52.080> the

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
attached to the straw audible to the

00:02:52.110 --> 00:03:02.150 
attached to the straw audible to the
dash

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:04.450 

here's<00:03:02.430> a<00:03:02.490> little<00:03:02.730> handy<00:03:02.970> trick<00:03:03.180> if<00:03:03.330> you

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:04.460 
here's a little handy trick if you

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:08.900 
here's a little handy trick if you
fabricate<00:03:05.460> using<00:03:05.850> body<00:03:06.330> putty<00:03:07.370> you<00:03:08.370> can<00:03:08.790> also

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:08.910 
fabricate using body putty you can also

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:10.850 
fabricate using body putty you can also
do<00:03:09.150> it<00:03:09.240> actually<00:03:09.540> with<00:03:09.660> a<00:03:09.690> resin<00:03:10.110> and

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:10.860 
do it actually with a resin and

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:15.290 
do it actually with a resin and
fiberglass<00:03:12.530> pieces<00:03:13.530> of<00:03:13.650> PVC<00:03:14.070> pipe<00:03:14.280> and<00:03:15.120> I<00:03:15.210> have

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 
fiberglass pieces of PVC pipe and I have

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:16.790 
fiberglass pieces of PVC pipe and I have
a<00:03:15.360> couple<00:03:15.540> different<00:03:15.630> sizes<00:03:15.930> I<00:03:16.260> keep<00:03:16.440> on<00:03:16.530> hand

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:16.800 
a couple different sizes I keep on hand

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:19.880 
a couple different sizes I keep on hand
some<00:03:17.670> of<00:03:17.760> them<00:03:17.850> are<00:03:17.940> whole<00:03:18.090> some<00:03:18.390> are<00:03:18.510> cut<00:03:18.890> but

00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:19.890 
some of them are whole some are cut but

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:21.590 
some of them are whole some are cut but
really<00:03:20.280> all<00:03:20.490> you<00:03:20.580> need<00:03:20.610> is<00:03:20.820> a<00:03:20.850> cut<00:03:21.060> circle<00:03:21.450> for

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:21.600 
really all you need is a cut circle for

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.750 
really all you need is a cut circle for
one<00:03:21.690> this<00:03:21.810> small<00:03:21.930> and<00:03:22.320> I<00:03:23.160> put<00:03:23.370> a<00:03:23.550> piece<00:03:23.700> of

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
one this small and I put a piece of

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.690 
one this small and I put a piece of
masking<00:03:24.000> table<00:03:24.480> on<00:03:24.540> it<00:03:25.220> you<00:03:26.220> could<00:03:26.400> just<00:03:26.430> do

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700 
masking table on it you could just do

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.590 
masking table on it you could just do
this<00:03:26.930> without<00:03:27.930> the<00:03:28.230> masking<00:03:28.620> tape<00:03:28.650> but<00:03:29.600> even

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
this without the masking tape but even

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:32.960 
this without the masking tape but even
with<00:03:30.750> the<00:03:30.870> parting<00:03:31.230> wax<00:03:31.740> sometimes<00:03:32.670> the<00:03:32.790> putty

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:32.970 
with the parting wax sometimes the putty

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:35.950 
with the parting wax sometimes the putty
still<00:03:33.240> gets<00:03:33.420> left<00:03:33.570> on<00:03:33.810> so<00:03:34.140> little<00:03:35.070> parting<00:03:35.340> wax

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:35.960 
still gets left on so little parting wax

00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:39.830 
still gets left on so little parting wax
and<00:03:36.960> you<00:03:36.990> just<00:03:37.350> change<00:03:37.590> the<00:03:37.680> tape<00:03:38.510> if<00:03:39.510> it<00:03:39.660> gets

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
and you just change the tape if it gets

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:45.200 
and you just change the tape if it gets
uh<00:03:41.120> putty<00:03:42.120> stuck<00:03:42.420> to<00:03:42.570> it<00:03:43.580> and<00:03:44.580> this<00:03:45.000> is<00:03:45.060> for

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:45.210 
uh putty stuck to it and this is for

00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:50.570 
uh putty stuck to it and this is for
rounding<00:03:45.960> corners<00:03:46.490> in<00:03:47.490> the<00:03:47.670> framework<00:03:49.580> yeah

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:50.580 
rounding corners in the framework yeah
