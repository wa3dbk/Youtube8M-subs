00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.320
 But it's nice if you are today 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:57.270
 I can not go after my room 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.410
 comment because it's about me 

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:59.550
 make time I have an example at the time 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.949
 already brought so I imagine 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.809

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:07.220

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:09.479
 hd shit sausage from your asshole 

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:11.430

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.820
 hard and mother goes to outside 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.200
 past 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:17.659

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.659
 like her that he's coming now shit 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:23.009
 So a noise creates a lot of fun 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.180
 is shit or and and that is exactly how it is 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.680
 it now also because we have applications 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.840
 Do not take the comment coming 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.229
 again the back overrun I come 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.000
 again before 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.229
 and that's why I have a little bit now 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.490
 waiting for it but now it comes 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.900

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.820
 what you have not mentioned yet is 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.790
 following really funny times 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.350
 on the last day we still have at night 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.729
 so said yes we will certainly tomorrow 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.829
 somehow miss the train 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.920
 The train leaves at 12.20 pm I take 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:02:01.950
 awake so on anton anton it is 12 o'clock 16 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:03.420

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:04.680
 the fun again extra cost that 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.700
 We overslept because it was to the train 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.799

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.090

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.909

 be freaked out and death was sweating 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.609

 already on it and what we still have 

00:03:05.989 --> 00:03:11.930

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:25.819
 story I ever happened 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:27.470
 or the funny or handicapped 

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:28.639
 history ever the comments 

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:29.989
 Write because I'll do it once 

00:03:28.639 --> 00:03:31.370
 video is the whole before now it has 

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:32.870
 but always said at the release 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:34.069
 somehow I do not know the stories like that 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:35.540
 there are always so a bit so 

00:03:34.069 --> 00:03:36.709
 way too blatantly mixed but if now 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:37.879
 Just because I can do that nicely 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:39.199
 disconnect and if you are mine 

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:40.970
 comment wrote then under 

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:43.010
 a story then definitely makes 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:44.329
 here again people without shit the 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:45.230
 most embarrassing or such story because of me 

00:03:44.329 --> 00:03:46.250
 first I want to read to me 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:47.870
 every case thought right 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:49.220
 laugh but I love something like that 

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:50.269
 every case and case will be the right one 

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:51.620
 have finally stories so cool 

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:54.169
 if the synonymous would not be something like that 

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:55.400
 a shit I'm immediately to the mountain 

00:03:54.169 --> 00:03:57.230
 played down that survived 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.220
 still three minutes fucked authority know 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:59.540
 which I mean, of course, an extreme 

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:03.440
 Realistic story I am 

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:04.730
 again a deserted person 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:07.209
 have trick is to clap hands 

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:09.349
 i do not say so on 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:10.940
 By the way, you should get the two 

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:12.270
 hands a controller telscher look and 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:14.040
 Of course some have 

00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:15.420
 very clever people noticed by you 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.680
 always two behind the controller are yes 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:18.989
 that's actually right now 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.370
 but noticed two different hands 

00:04:18.989 --> 00:04:21.360
 from different people yes to everyone 

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.920
 case I would look again 

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:24.540
 is the channel because it has somehow 

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:25.860
 somehow at youtube full of little clicks 

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:27.210
 There were in the last two days at all 

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:28.350
 but somehow affects again 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:29.670
 different in any case very entertaining 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:31.890
 I would say as the most entertaining 

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:33.270
 videos on this channel because I'm there 

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:34.680
 easy without shit like others did not 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:36.210
 Of course, I'm crazy 

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.350
 tries almost every kill with four zones 

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:39.870
 until now from original swiss 

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:42.180
 Of course, but also belongs without shit 

00:04:39.870 --> 00:04:43.440
 There is so incredibly bock made 

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.970
 so if you have not seen that and 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:46.200
 should there new items, I count in any case 

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:48.300
 Now we think the whole thing on youtube 

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:50.190
 normalized to her without shit like 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:52.140
 you live if someone is here a week 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:53.730
 long you sit and you are one 

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:54.810
 now the whole one's own room yes 

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:55.980
 so of course you can also 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:56.730
 Go out and say, of course 

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:58.680
 very much done 

00:04:56.730 --> 00:05:00.150
 The oxygen is somehow currently 

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:01.830
 sometime sucked is just 

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:03.150
 handicapped people have been disabled so i 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:04.590
 you just have to cut it out 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:05.820
 Rear hang without shit I 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:07.530
 also attached to antons videos 

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:08.190
 had hung because that's so funny 

00:05:07.530 --> 00:05:09.390
 and like us 

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:10.490
 I just comment on it live 

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:13.320
 tried when he was here again 

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:14.400
 slimmed down in other two clips 

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:15.300
 I ran to us quite yet 

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:16.320
 Slicing a bit is a couple of clubs 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:18.150
 but I also had this video the 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:19.410
 handicapped round so well and me 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:20.610
 can often times together sections 

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:21.510
 make of such rounds because that 

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:22.710
 you like it very well 

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:23.970
 Of course that's a bit 

00:05:22.710 --> 00:05:25.200
 overdriven what I'm right now 

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:28.080
 but it will depend on everyone 

00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:29.940
 case again been like that 

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:30.840
 we are happy to slim down together then 

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:32.430
 Let's see how I'm so sorry 

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:33.540
 Comments easily record so by 

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:35.100
 turn because somehow not worked and 

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:36.630
 then both are just dehydrated 

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:38.220
 because we just have the whole day 

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:39.770
 have drunk energy drinks and easy 

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:42.390
 no air 

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:44.520
 that was really funny of the 

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:46.350
 wind power documents subscribed to the channel 

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:49.140
 scorpion place if you still have it 

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:50.520
 and of course I will
