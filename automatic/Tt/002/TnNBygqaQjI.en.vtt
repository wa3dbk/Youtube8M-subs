00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:07.690
 like the other agreements and we carry 

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:09.309
 out this video one more video for me 

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:11.530
 channel and good on this occasion let's say 

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:14.200
 that is not a simple video 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:16.380
 commented so chingÃ³n no kids this is 

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:19.419
 a video of let's say a reminder 

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:22.300
 from gears of war 1 to people who 

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:25.450
 they died that they died as is the case 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:28.360
 of Carmen as is the case of Kim too 

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:31.660
 the case of renÃ© and well I made a small 

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:33.969
 a little biography what something that 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:36.880
 happened to these characters also let's say 

00:00:33.969 --> 00:00:39.880
 that we see 10 15 seconds or so if 

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:42.010
 you want to read the biography 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:45.490
 I recommend that they stop the video because they are 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:48.250
 it's like a paragraph that's full but if 

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:50.920
 the people who have not played 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:54.670
 gears of war 1 I recommend you not 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:57.250
 watch the video I do not want to ruin the 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:59.980
 story of this this game that was one 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:02.500

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:05.700
