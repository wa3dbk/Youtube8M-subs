00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.330
 Hello what Pasca without crash 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:08.820
 today i will tell you two ways how 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:13.349
 can paint eggs natural 

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:15.870
 dyes and one way decoupage for 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.770
 to paint eggs with natural 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:21.960
 dyes I boiled them hard 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:25.050
 preferably of course brothers white eggs 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:28.230
 so we had beautiful bright and 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.880
 colorful take kurkov slurp 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.079
 differently it is called Indian 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:36.930
 Saffron and color we will have Krashenki 

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:41.160
 yellow color take half a liter key to 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:45.890
 count I already boiled some water pouring 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:50.579
 quietly bath and pour there 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:55.190
 bag of turmeric and drop there already 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:58.350
 boiled egg ready for her 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:02.129
 it turns out beautiful monochrome lot 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:09.590
 no dyes why 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:16.189
 made there are lots of ways to do 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:16.189
 beautiful eggs on 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:28.860
 take well this spice smells of youth 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:31.320
 and also drop the egg and we'll be there 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:35.340
 look for what time it is with us 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:39.980
 paint and lucy in another way u 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:47.729
 we take these blue eggs 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:50.640
 red cabbage finely shred here 

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:53.940
 this amount is enough and you need even these 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:56.460
 a little less but when you will be bigger 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:58.740
 the amount of dyeing their eggs and when 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:01.830
 understandably need more 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:07.280
 Now we take this cabbage and fill it 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:10.110
 boiling water we take boiled water cabbage 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:14.730
 see it immediately becomes with us 

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:24.840
 blue color and naturally we hide there 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:27.410
 eggs - the night is gentle blue our color 

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.410
 eggs 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:39.340
 all and leave to be painted in principle if 

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:42.160
 you leave but just look whichever 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:44.800
 want the color I last time made up 

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:48.280
 the night I have not turned blue 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:52.990
 and blue but nothing terrible, I took and 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:56.520
 Scratch made a scratch with a needle 

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:59.770
 it was very beautiful unusual 

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:01.480
 see show another one the easiest and 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:05.440
 the most beautiful he 

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:08.560
 way to cook our easter 

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.280
 eggs is called this decoupage method and 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.970
 tion 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:18.070
 Of course an interesting name is taken 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:24.880
 boiled egg we take a dense good 

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:27.209
 quality napkin separates this one 

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:27.209
 little white 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:35.739
 separately neat well 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:39.760
 peel off and cut out let's do 

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:43.350
 so I already cooked and cut out 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:49.690
 patterns can now have a mass 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:53.890
 easter napkins so i cut out to 

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:56.170
 show you the idea how to us them 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:58.810
 glue here is the most interesting in order 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:01.060
 to glue them and then to eat 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:03.040
 it could have been egg super-glue not 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:07.500
 glue if you glue what to eat already 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:11.950
 you can't take normal squirrels 

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:13.720
 eggs as we did Easter separated 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:18.970
 I'm yolks from proteins 

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:21.959
 we have ready to be locked take smear 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:21.959
 egg 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:37.330
 and glue our eyes and so on 

00:04:31.689 --> 00:04:42.490
 neatly brush with glue and 

00:04:37.330 --> 00:04:56.779
 so on and it turns out we 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:05:00.020
 beautiful egg so we continue those 

00:04:56.779 --> 00:05:02.870
 eyes are a very good way to attract 

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:09.460
 cook diet you of little babes 

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:15.830
 so that they themselves prepare Easter 

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:17.169
 egg so neat and then when 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:22.389
 completely 

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:24.409
 you made a little pattern and take 

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:29.300

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:37.430
 proteins you put height now we still here 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:44.449

00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:48.169
 not worth it now see where we are not 

00:05:44.449 --> 00:05:50.300

00:05:57.469 --> 00:06:04.159
 now look here this egg we 

00:06:02.199 --> 00:06:07.370
