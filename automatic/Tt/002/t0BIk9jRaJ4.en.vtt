00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:16.660
 hello everybody, motor car, a tip for 

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:19.510
 You who are suffering with defect 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:20.950
 square slow square developer you already 

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:22.420
 took the car in various workshops changed 

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:25.540
 until the mode did not solve 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:27.340
 much attention you can switch in the 

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:29.890
 in a car that is wiring the 

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:31.510
 sensors totally wrong and you switch 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:32.230
 the car module behaves the same 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:34.620
 way 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:37.930
 not that the module is not 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.960
 he was stuck someone tried 

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:43.030
 to fix the car 

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:45.280
 of yours and the time you put the 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.900
 module or the original defect even 

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:49.269
 car is still bad 

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:52.540
 so here's the tip you'll change a 

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:55.390
 legal way of this continuity of 

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:57.519
 sensor connectors and actuators up to 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:01.059
 the module especially if I had 

00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:04.750
 tape less high origin was everything 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:07.990
 forced to mess everything up the spinning 

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:10.570
 also a little bug you can already stay 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:11.020
 Smart Looks Just How Cheap The Wiring Here 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.479
 O 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:16.840
 Look at the color of the threads here. 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:19.450
 I did not hit the wiring color, it's wireless 

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:23.890
 points out of the sale with a lot of 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:25.870
 movies at the time we are were pulling the 

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:27.970
 readings here we entered with the 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:29.200
 scheme and has been tested and 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:31.210
 set this car here to do 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:34.540
 parameter is very bad his system is 

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:37.750
 very old can not have 95 we went 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:40.030
 measure did not hit the sky in sign here not 

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:41.260
 had positive 5 volts 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.120
 today the five others had no 

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.860
 grounding in the right position 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:47.980
 much less a sign from his wife 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:52.360
 the hose 

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:55.480
 vacuum from the collector that leads to the 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:56.950
 sensor and map that connect wrong point 

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:59.530
 point where the cow 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.990
 so you change the car module is good 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:03.850
 It's not there, the car does not look good. 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:06.550
 people think that it is not 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:08.050
 mode after repairing the 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:09.640
 correct in the application because after 

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:11.560
 connect the right vacuum hose and 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.870
 check other items 

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.750
 just put a module that solves the problem 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.970
 problem, but the module is placed before 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.889
 to review the spinning the car behave 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:24.219
 evil suddenly who kills a new way 

00:02:20.889 --> 00:02:24.870
 because everything connected wrong here reform 

00:02:24.219 --> 00:02:27.870
 of the new 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:30.560
 for the goal module is good then before 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:33.959
 to change the module before touching the mob 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:36.989
 test and action keep an eye on the state 

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:39.629
 whip test point to point continuity 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:41.489
 ok and especially short between wires have 

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:44.190
 A video, I'll leave it here to you. 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:45.720
 talking about how to test in a way 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.000
 You put pipino in your head. 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.340
 when testing whip continuity an 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.430
 neighbor very cool and has a video about 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:55.590
 bad contact on the mode connector is 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:59.069
 another video here for you too 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:01.410
 fun then it was there to change the module 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:03.780
 before that you have to test for continuity 

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:07.319
 which are mainly if you have 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:09.480
 so non-original tapes were poked 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:11.549
 in this case they are connected wrong 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:14.760
 signal that carries the signal from the 

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:16.890
 sensor was going right for nothing 

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.870
 because they are wrapped inside and 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:21.709
 whip with the pointed tip and look at 

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:25.109
 what a cheap earthing so far 

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:27.959
 in this circuit was a bridge that 

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:30.150
 Oh, I even cut the bridge I used to 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:31.709
 same wire as earth sensor 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:33.810
 position of the butterfly even though the 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:35.280
 the map sensor that also had 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:38.160
 made a bridge here 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:40.290
 So you're fixing the wiring now, yes. 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.450
 you can put a new mode now yes 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.340
 will have a good result superdicas 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:47.579
 another car and I'll see you at the good site. 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:50.069
 Day, I liked it, please share this 

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:51.780
 video on youtube and if you want to know 

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:53.489
 more than a very interesting subject 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:55.560
 here and you can subscribe click 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:58.440
 here and subscribe also our channel 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:02.120
 it's good and tire settled in the other car 

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.120
 na ale
