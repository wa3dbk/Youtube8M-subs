00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.460
 ah 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:16.290
 ah 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:50.200
 hi people i am killer kripper too 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.990
 known as johnny he picked up his rifle and 

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.970
 we are here today in a mod 

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:58.270
 what good is very interesting as you see 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:01:00.680
 it's about mutant creepers that 

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:03.020
 jump 

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:05.660
 let's see if the orÃ¡n jump with this a little 

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:08.090
 far high and crazy and exploits 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:10.610
 they also have peace of mind that they are 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.670
 like some mini creepers that are like there 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:14.530
 is it so 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:15.790
 and good that I am playing in creative 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:19.380
 but I think if I was playing a 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:19.380
 survival would be more fantastic 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:26.460
 and good to say in this way then that 

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:28.439
 has a few details that are 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:31.679
 very good, let's start first by 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:33.780
 these jumping creepers are like 

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:35.490
 giant bugs that have like 50 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.640
 hearts of life is to say that we can 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:42.870
 beat them a lot of times they take 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:45.450
 in dying when they die to see if he dies 

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:49.020
 there makes a last explosion that 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:51.710
 it attracts up there total how to explode and it 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.560
 leave an egg of kripper 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:56.299
 what is it and press the right button I have it 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.030
 in my head you can see it better here 

00:01:56.299 --> 00:02:03.229
 it's in my head and good as this 

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:05.210
 egg what you are going to do is a mini 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:07.460
 Creepers of a pet creepers makes 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:10.270
 missing three days in minecraft so that 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:12.920
 grow and walk through it your ball 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:17.280
 so then let's wait three days 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:19.740
 from minecraft to check what they do 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.830
 to wait good since I brought the baby 

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:23.850
 of egg here to a safer area 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:26.060
 because how will it be from now 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:27.959
 My pet I want to take care of her very well 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:29.520
 I will also comment that that is 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:33.030
 kripper we wrote before the clippers 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.530
 mutants feed on explosions that 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:37.950
 it means that we can not kill them with 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:40.260
 tnt or any other good other 

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.330
 explosive even if a crime explodes 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.340
 next to them then that friend who 

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:46.470
 is there in the background if it explodes next to 

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.930
 they will give you life, I do not know if you 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.310
 you fix before but when it explodes or something 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.760
 this is how small hearts appear 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:56.190
 around the mutant clipper and those 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:59.100
 hearts is that it is gaining more life or 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:01.320
 it would be harder to kill them good 

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:03.450
 so let's keep waiting here to see 

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:06.060
 if the egg grows it has to be something 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:08.459
 very very very very charming then 

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:11.880
 we hope good after being 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:14.560
 waiting three days for 3 to 5 days has 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:17.200
 realized that here something was missing 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:20.660
 and I've come down here underneath and I've found 

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:23.390
 my little creeper here is 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:25.730
 we have lost good I have lost what 

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:28.190
 which is when it breaks the shell but 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:30.620
 well there it is we are going to see the other 

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:33.440
 method to get these 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:36.380
 tiny little children of there are two 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:39.080
 ways to incubate these flu eggs 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:43.670
 and we've seen it before it was 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:46.070
 waiting for 3 to 5 days and another one that is a 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:47.780
 little easier than it is because feeding 

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:49.580
 the connt 

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.440
 when the tnt explodes is some 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:53.090
 hearts in the egg that is as if 

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:56.510
 let's live more life then we are 

00:03:53.090 --> 00:04:00.260
 subtracting days of delay before 

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:02.870
 come out the clipper then let's see a 

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:05.050
 explosive growth of a crime let's go 

00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:05.050
 there 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:20.930
 and there it is after a hard but 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:23.540
 effective incubation process through 

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:26.780
 explosions we have accelerated the 

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:30.610
 growth of this kripper egg and how 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:32.860
 You see, it has grown before the other 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:34.389
 well, this kripper acts like a 

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:36.639
 wolf if we give the right vote it 

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:39.280
 feel in a very strange way but 

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:43.379
 quite funny to give it again what 

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:43.379
 does is follow us and follow us 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:51.900
 I 'm going to call it flow fi and well 

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:53.640
 it is a blow dies and it is already nothing 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:57.540
 when we have located one of these 

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:59.790
 giant mutated monsters what are we going 

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:02.130
 to do is first settle our 

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:04.710
 small rebuke and then kill this 

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:07.170
 giant guy and let's see what 

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:09.960
 then we can get part of 

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:11.490
 little kripper what we can get to 

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:13.790
 from the egg let's go there we 're going to 

00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:17.560
 act on it 

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:17.560
 there he is once he is dead 

00:05:18.249 --> 00:05:22.959
 ok it has killed my little gripper 

00:05:20.399 --> 00:05:25.149
 we have the egg and now we destroy 

00:05:22.959 --> 00:05:28.389
 the egg there are two or two possibilities of 

00:05:25.149 --> 00:05:30.590
 that we have a series of items we are going to 

00:05:28.389 --> 00:05:33.150
 see the first 

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:35.880
 the first is this gunpowder 

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:38.900
 ok and the second one I'm going to look for another 

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:41.610
 mutant kripper mother and I teach you the 

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:43.290
 second option that this egg can give 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:45.740
 Well see if it works now 

00:05:43.290 --> 00:05:45.740
 second method 

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:52.070
 and there we have got this 

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:54.530
 it's called creepers art and what it does 

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:58.100
 is the following explosions by a tube 

00:05:54.530 --> 00:06:00.380
 is one is a pretty effective weapon and the 

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:02.300
 true after killing this giant 

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:04.430
 Well, the truth is that it is like a prize not 

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:06.950
 and let's see what I can do to 

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:09.590
 hit some not to the different modes 

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:12.710
 what's in this game is what's done 

00:06:09.590 --> 00:06:14.360
 pair of skeletons so let's give it 

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:16.310
 a little bit of straw 

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:17.990
 Well I think I've already killed the 

00:06:16.310 --> 00:06:19.490
 The first thing you see is a very 

00:06:17.990 --> 00:06:21.409
 effective let's see what he does with the 

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:24.349
 clipper 

00:06:21.409 --> 00:06:24.860
 also dead good well up here 

00:06:24.349 --> 00:06:27.050
 this mod 

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:29.449
 I liked it a lot, I hope that 

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:31.610
 I like you and good one last 

00:06:29.449 --> 00:06:33.769
 advice try not to give these 

00:06:31.610 --> 00:06:35.839
 mutant creepers next to a village 

00:06:33.769 --> 00:06:37.999
 good or next to your house because 

00:06:35.839 --> 00:06:40.399
 you can see the great devastation that 

00:06:37.999 --> 00:06:42.830
 a kripper of these mutants imagine 

00:06:40.399 --> 00:06:44.809
 two or three then be very careful 

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:48.499
 and well then see you in the next 

00:06:44.809 --> 00:06:48.860
 chapter of killer mods and nothing that's 

00:06:48.499 --> 00:06:52.449
 all 

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:52.449
 a greeting killer creepers and peace
