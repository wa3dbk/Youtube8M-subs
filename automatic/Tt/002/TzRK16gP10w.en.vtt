is<00:01:50.130> annoying<00:01:50.430> but<00:01:50.729> I<00:01:51.060> find<00:01:51.600> myself<00:01:51.720> being

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
is annoying but I find myself being

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.649 
is annoying but I find myself being
pretty<00:01:52.500> deadly<00:01:52.979> accurate<00:01:53.640> definitely<00:01:54.479> don't

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
pretty deadly accurate definitely don't

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:55.969 
pretty deadly accurate definitely don't
be<00:01:54.869> taking<00:01:55.170> multiple<00:01:55.500> enemies<00:01:55.770> of<00:01:55.890> this

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
be taking multiple enemies of this

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.340 
be taking multiple enemies of this
weapon<00:01:56.329> because<00:01:57.329> you<00:01:57.420> can't<00:01:57.659> be<00:01:57.750> very<00:01:57.930> agile

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
weapon because you can't be very agile

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.830 
weapon because you can't be very agile
as<00:01:58.530> you're<00:01:58.680> shooting<00:01:58.890> but<00:01:59.399> it's<00:01:59.790> good<00:02:00.119> for

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
as you're shooting but it's good for

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.560 
as you're shooting but it's good for
long<00:02:01.350> distances<00:02:01.890> I'd<00:02:02.040> say<00:02:02.250> hip<00:02:02.850> fire<00:02:03.090> coming

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
long distances I'd say hip fire coming

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.539 
long distances I'd say hip fire coming
in<00:02:03.719> clutch<00:02:03.960> there<00:02:04.259> it's<00:02:04.500> got<00:02:04.619> +3<00:02:05.070> handling

00:02:05.539 --> 00:02:05.549 
in clutch there it's got +3 handling

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:07.459 
in clutch there it's got +3 handling
which<00:02:06.149> means<00:02:06.360> the<00:02:06.509> hip<00:02:06.659> fire<00:02:06.840> spreads<00:02:07.229> better

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
which means the hip fire spreads better

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:09.320 
which means the hip fire spreads better
it's<00:02:07.979> not<00:02:08.129> very<00:02:08.459> obvious<00:02:08.610> like<00:02:09.030> if<00:02:09.149> you<00:02:09.209> look

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
it's not very obvious like if you look

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.460 
it's not very obvious like if you look
to<00:02:09.450> handling<00:02:09.840> you<00:02:09.899> won't<00:02:10.020> even<00:02:10.229> know<00:02:10.349> what

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
to handling you won't even know what

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:11.680 
to handling you won't even know what
that<00:02:10.530> means

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:11.690 
that means

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.640 
that means
this<00:02:12.690> is<00:02:12.810> guy<00:02:12.930> can<00:02:13.080> go

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
this is guy can go

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.000 
this is guy can go
this<00:02:14.129> guy<00:02:14.310> going<00:02:14.459> to<00:02:14.549> go<00:02:14.840> he's<00:02:15.840> that<00:02:16.049> assault
