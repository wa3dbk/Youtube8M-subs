doing the wiring here the factory says

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:46.310 
doing the wiring here the factory says
at<00:01:45.119> least<00:01:45.390> a<00:01:45.540> couple<00:01:45.690> of<00:01:45.900> months<00:01:46.200> in

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
installation time practically all they

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.109 
installation time practically all they
have<00:01:49.530> to<00:01:49.680> do<00:01:49.799> at<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.040> site<00:01:50.310> is<00:01:50.610> plug<00:01:50.970> the

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:51.119 
have to do at the site is plug the

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.529 
have to do at the site is plug the
office<00:01:51.479> in<00:01:51.659> and<00:01:51.930> tie<00:01:52.200> it<00:01:52.259> into<00:01:52.500> the<00:01:52.680> trunk<00:01:52.920> line

00:01:53.529 --> 00:01:53.539 
office in and tie it into the trunk line

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:56.480 
office in and tie it into the trunk line
the<00:01:54.539> whole<00:01:54.720> system's<00:01:55.350> tested<00:01:55.920> right<00:01:56.130> here<00:01:56.399> at

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490 
the whole system's tested right here at

00:01:56.490 --> 00:01:59.060 
the whole system's tested right here at
the<00:01:56.610> plant<00:01:56.940> before<00:01:57.509> it<00:01:57.600> leaves<00:01:57.830> inside<00:01:58.830> and

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
the plant before it leaves inside and

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.080 
the plant before it leaves inside and
out<00:01:59.190> number<00:01:59.759> by<00:02:00.090> number<00:02:01.549> so<00:02:02.549> when<00:02:02.700> we<00:02:02.820> pack

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
out number by number so when we pack

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.330 
out number by number so when we pack
this<00:02:03.299> thing<00:02:03.509> to<00:02:03.630> travel<00:02:03.869> we<00:02:04.799> know<00:02:04.979> it<00:02:05.100> works

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
this thing to travel we know it works

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:07.790 
this thing to travel we know it works
and<00:02:05.700> all<00:02:06.509> the<00:02:06.659> packing<00:02:07.049> is<00:02:07.110> around<00:02:07.380> a<00:02:07.530> steel

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:07.800 
and all the packing is around a steel

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.979 
and all the packing is around a steel
truss<00:02:08.190> so<00:02:08.759> we<00:02:08.910> know<00:02:09.030> it'll<00:02:09.239> work<00:02:09.420> when<00:02:09.630> it<00:02:09.750> gets

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
truss so we know it'll work when it gets

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:17.059 
truss so we know it'll work when it gets
where<00:02:10.200> it's<00:02:10.319> going<00:02:15.050> we<00:02:16.050> can<00:02:16.200> build<00:02:16.410> a<00:02:16.620> one<00:02:16.890> or

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
where it's going we can build a one or

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:18.920 
where it's going we can build a one or
two<00:02:17.220> thousand<00:02:17.700> line<00:02:17.880> central<00:02:18.330> office<00:02:18.660> in<00:02:18.870> a
