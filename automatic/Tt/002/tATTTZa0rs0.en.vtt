00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.280 
design and you for the handles you need
to<00:00:33.210> fold<00:00:33.420> in<00:00:33.600> half<00:00:35.270> like<00:00:36.270> that<00:00:36.540> just<00:00:36.899> a<00:00:37.050> small

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
to fold in half like that just a small

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.069 
to fold in half like that just a small
handle<00:00:37.649> like<00:00:37.829> that<00:00:37.860> just<00:00:38.670> a<00:00:38.760> couple<00:00:39.210> and<00:00:39.840> glue

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.930 
it together we make the chamber just
fold<00:00:42.239> it<00:00:42.390> in<00:00:42.570> half<00:00:42.629> this<00:00:43.170> way<00:00:43.489> see<00:00:44.489> how<00:00:44.550> long<00:00:44.789> it

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
fold it in half this way see how long it

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.750 
fold it in half this way see how long it
is<00:00:45.079> okay<00:00:46.579> and<00:00:47.780> for<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:48.899> paper<00:00:49.140> clip<00:00:49.760> you'll

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
is okay and for the paper clip you'll

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.689 
is okay and for the paper clip you'll
need<00:00:51.030> the<00:00:52.010> scissors<00:00:55.460> basically<00:00:56.460> what<00:00:56.610> you

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
need the scissors basically what you

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:59.630 
need the scissors basically what you
have<00:00:56.730> to<00:00:56.879> do<00:00:57.030> is<00:00:57.239> left<00:00:57.480> it<00:00:57.660> yeah<00:00:58.410> so<00:00:58.739> you<00:00:59.520> have

have to do is left it yeah so you have
to<00:00:59.820> take<00:01:00.270> the<00:01:00.510> paper<00:01:00.719> clip<00:01:01.020> and<00:01:02.989> fold<00:01:03.989> it<00:01:04.140> out

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:04.290 
to take the paper clip and fold it out

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:11.000 
to take the paper clip and fold it out
like<00:01:04.979> this<00:01:05.430> then<00:01:06.110> just<00:01:07.110> have<00:01:07.260> to<00:01:07.610> cut<00:01:08.610> off<00:01:10.010> that

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
like this then just have to cut off that

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.090 
like this then just have to cut off that
bit<00:01:11.310> right<00:01:11.549> there<00:01:12.619> that's<00:01:13.619> all<00:01:13.799> you<00:01:13.920> need

nothing just like that and then need to

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:20.210 
nothing just like that and then need to
be<00:01:16.740> like<00:01:16.920> a<00:01:16.950> triangular<00:01:17.820> kind<00:01:18.210> of<00:01:18.330> shape<00:01:19.220> that

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
be like a triangular kind of shape that

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:25.720 
be like a triangular kind of shape that
and<00:01:20.610> you<00:01:21.479> dip<00:01:22.350> it<00:01:22.500> in<00:01:22.650> the<00:01:22.950> glue<00:01:23.390> like

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:25.730 
and you dip it in the glue like

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:29.800 
and you dip it in the glue like
that<00:01:26.860> you<00:01:27.860> rub<00:01:28.040> it<00:01:28.160> in<00:01:28.280> the<00:01:28.400> glue<00:01:28.610> so<00:01:29.390> it's<00:01:29.540> kind

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.810 
that you rub it in the glue so it's kind

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.990 
that you rub it in the glue so it's kind
of<00:01:29.900> coded<00:01:30.290> in<00:01:30.620> glue<00:01:31.120> and<00:01:33.190> put<00:01:34.190> into<00:01:34.880> the

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
of coded in glue and put into the

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.030 
of coded in glue and put into the
chamber<00:01:35.690> yeah<00:01:37.900> right<00:01:38.900> and<00:01:39.170> then<00:01:39.380> you<00:01:39.800> could

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:40.040 
chamber yeah right and then you could

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.650 
chamber yeah right and then you could
stick<00:01:41.000> it<00:01:41.030> on<00:01:42.280> okay<00:01:43.280> okay<00:01:44.030> so<00:01:44.090> you're<00:01:44.450> going<00:01:44.570> to

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:44.660 
stick it on okay okay so you're going to

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:47.410 
stick it on okay okay so you're going to
depend<00:01:45.380> how<00:01:45.620> many<00:01:45.830> barrels<00:01:46.100> you<00:01:46.370> want<00:01:46.580> you<00:01:47.270> are

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.420 
depend how many barrels you want you are

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.540 
depend how many barrels you want you are
going<00:01:47.780> to<00:01:48.050> put<00:01:48.230> a<00:01:48.290> paperclip<00:01:48.620> for<00:01:49.010> each<00:01:49.160> barrel

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:49.550 
going to put a paperclip for each barrel

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:53.820 
going to put a paperclip for each barrel
and<00:01:49.670> basically<00:01:50.660> what<00:01:51.290> you<00:01:51.440> want<00:01:51.650> afterwards

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:53.830 
and basically what you want afterwards

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:57.610 
and basically what you want afterwards
is<00:01:54.830> you'll<00:01:55.100> take<00:01:55.460> the<00:01:55.580> glue<00:01:55.820> stick<00:01:56.350> I'm<00:01:57.350> doing

00:01:57.610 --> 00:01:57.620 
is you'll take the glue stick I'm doing

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:00.640 
is you'll take the glue stick I'm doing
but<00:01:57.950> but<00:01:58.100> first<00:01:58.340> you're<00:01:58.460> gonna<00:01:58.520> have<00:01:58.700> to<00:01:59.650> cut

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:00.650 
but but first you're gonna have to cut

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:04.360 
but but first you're gonna have to cut
cut<00:02:00.980> off<00:02:01.160> with<00:02:02.030> this<00:02:02.210> like<00:02:02.890> use<00:02:03.890> it<00:02:04.070> and<00:02:04.250> then

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:04.370 
cut off with this like use it and then

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:08.230 
cut off with this like use it and then
bang<00:02:04.880> inside<00:02:05.390> there<00:02:06.400> you<00:02:07.400> basically<00:02:07.640> put<00:02:07.880> in

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:08.240 
bang inside there you basically put in

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.910 
bang inside there you basically put in
like<00:02:08.360> that<00:02:08.540> and<00:02:08.750> you<00:02:08.990> can<00:02:09.170> fill<00:02:09.350> it<00:02:09.500> as<00:02:09.619> as<00:02:09.890> many

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:09.920 
like that and you can fill it as as many

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:12.520 
like that and you can fill it as as many
glue<00:02:10.490> sticks<00:02:10.790> as<00:02:10.940> you<00:02:11.060> want<00:02:11.240> and<00:02:11.480> depending<00:02:12.380> on

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
glue sticks as you want and depending on

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.550 
glue sticks as you want and depending on
that<00:02:12.650> you<00:02:12.980> make<00:02:13.220> the<00:02:13.460> paper<00:02:14.090> roll<00:02:14.930> bigger<00:02:15.320> or

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
that you make the paper roll bigger or

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.120 
that you make the paper roll bigger or
smaller<00:02:15.910> you<00:02:16.910> look<00:02:17.330> at<00:02:17.450> your<00:02:17.540> design<00:02:17.930> and<00:02:18.260> the

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:19.130 
smaller you look at your design and the

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.670 
smaller you look at your design and the
next<00:02:19.400> thing<00:02:19.640> okay<00:02:20.540> so<00:02:20.810> far<00:02:21.020> we<00:02:21.200> have<00:02:21.290> made<00:02:21.500> the

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
next thing okay so far we have made the

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.080 
next thing okay so far we have made the
handle<00:02:22.100> so<00:02:22.850> we'll<00:02:23.840> have<00:02:24.020> to<00:02:24.670> cross<00:02:25.670> off<00:02:26.060> the

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
handle so we'll have to cross off the

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:30.070 
handle so we'll have to cross off the
barrel<00:02:26.660> and<00:02:26.980> the<00:02:27.980> handle<00:02:28.810> so<00:02:29.810> all<00:02:30.050> we

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.080 
barrel and the handle so all we

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.400 
barrel and the handle so all we
basically<00:02:30.680> need<00:02:31.010> is<00:02:31.510> the<00:02:32.510> nozzle<00:02:32.780> at<00:02:33.110> the<00:02:33.290> end

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:33.410 
basically need is the nozzle at the end

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:37.840 
basically need is the nozzle at the end
and<00:02:33.730> the<00:02:34.730> cocking<00:02:35.330> mechanism<00:02:36.490> okay<00:02:37.490> for<00:02:37.760> the

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:37.850 
and the cocking mechanism okay for the

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:41.560 
and the cocking mechanism okay for the
cocking<00:02:38.270> mechanism<00:02:38.950> it's<00:02:39.950> cool<00:02:40.490> all<00:02:40.940> you<00:02:41.360> need

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:41.570 
cocking mechanism it's cool all you need

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:45.540 
cocking mechanism it's cool all you need
is<00:02:41.840> the<00:02:42.709> spring<00:02:43.070> the<00:02:43.340> spring<00:02:43.520> from<00:02:44.150> the<00:02:44.330> pen

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550 
is the spring the spring from the pen

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:50.440 
is the spring the spring from the pen
just<00:02:46.550> a<00:02:46.820> tiny<00:02:47.390> spring<00:02:47.870> and<00:02:48.709> you<00:02:49.280> can<00:02:49.550> use<00:02:49.940> cut

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
just a tiny spring and you can use cut

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:52.979 
just a tiny spring and you can use cut
and<00:02:50.930> all<00:02:51.140> you<00:02:51.260> need<00:02:51.440> is<00:02:51.590> to<00:02:51.620> cut<00:02:51.800> the<00:02:52.190> people

00:02:52.979 --> 00:02:52.989 
and all you need is to cut the people

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:58.860 
and all you need is to cut the people
that<00:02:54.370> like<00:02:55.370> that<00:02:55.580> you<00:02:56.360> take<00:02:56.630> the<00:02:56.780> spring<00:02:57.140> and

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
that like that you take the spring and

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.560 
that like that you take the spring and
you<00:02:59.870> fold<00:03:00.680> in<00:03:00.890> half<00:03:01.250> let's<00:03:01.820> tear<00:03:02.090> off<00:03:02.270> the

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:02.570 
you fold in half let's tear off the

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:04.910 
you fold in half let's tear off the
edges

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:10.670 

that's<00:03:05.580> mom<00:03:07.010> that's<00:03:08.010> more<00:03:08.930> then<00:03:09.930> you<00:03:10.380> just

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
that's mom that's more then you just

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.839 
that's mom that's more then you just
talk<00:03:11.280> in<00:03:11.459> the<00:03:11.610> paper<00:03:11.849> clip<00:03:12.420> I<00:03:12.660> mean<00:03:12.989> the<00:03:13.170> spring

00:03:13.839 --> 00:03:13.849 
talk in the paper clip I mean the spring

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:20.839 
talk in the paper clip I mean the spring
back<00:03:15.950> right<00:03:16.950> there<00:03:17.190> and<00:03:17.660> then<00:03:18.660> I<00:03:19.610> you<00:03:20.610> take

00:03:20.839 --> 00:03:20.849 
back right there and then I you take

00:03:20.849 --> 00:03:26.210 
back right there and then I you take
your<00:03:21.120> thing<00:03:21.930> and<00:03:24.140> attach<00:03:25.140> it<00:03:25.170> like<00:03:25.440> that<00:03:25.800> so

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:26.220 
your thing and attach it like that so

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.910 
your thing and attach it like that so
right<00:03:26.940> now<00:03:26.970> where's<00:03:27.450> the<00:03:27.660> barrel<00:03:28.020> and<00:03:28.140> then

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
right now where's the barrel and then

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:30.830 
right now where's the barrel and then
you<00:03:29.160> take<00:03:29.370> the<00:03:29.580> coping<00:03:29.970> mechanism<00:03:30.510> in<00:03:30.690> you

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
you take the coping mechanism in you

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.210 
you take the coping mechanism in you
know<00:03:30.989> just<00:03:31.290> hold<00:03:31.530> it<00:03:31.709> against<00:03:32.250> an<00:03:33.470> ok<00:03:34.470> you

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
know just hold it against an ok you

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:36.530 
know just hold it against an ok you
attach<00:03:35.459> the<00:03:35.489> spring<00:03:35.940> to<00:03:36.090> the<00:03:36.180> back<00:03:36.330> of<00:03:36.360> the

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
attach the spring to the back of the

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.949 
attach the spring to the back of the
glue<00:03:36.780> then<00:03:37.680> back<00:03:37.980> to<00:03:38.190> the<00:03:38.280> back<00:03:38.430> of<00:03:38.459> the<00:03:38.610> glue

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:38.959 
glue then back to the back of the glue

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:44.780 
glue then back to the back of the glue
push<00:03:39.959> the<00:03:40.080> spring<00:03:41.780> so<00:03:42.780> you<00:03:42.840> want<00:03:43.200> to<00:03:43.700> hold<00:03:44.700> it

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:44.790 
push the spring so you want to hold it

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.050 
push the spring so you want to hold it
in<00:03:44.940> place<00:03:45.319> with<00:03:46.319> the<00:03:46.470> stretch<00:03:46.739> the<00:03:46.920> spring<00:03:47.160> all

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
in place with the stretch the spring all

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:52.460 
in place with the stretch the spring all
the<00:03:48.450> way<00:03:48.510> around<00:03:49.250> down<00:03:50.250> there<00:03:50.519> ya<00:03:51.180> see<00:03:51.480> ya

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:52.470 
the way around down there ya see ya

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:55.850 
the way around down there ya see ya
there<00:03:53.810> stretch<00:03:54.810> it<00:03:54.959> all<00:03:55.110> the<00:03:55.290> way<00:03:55.380> to<00:03:55.440> the<00:03:55.650> back

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:55.860 
there stretch it all the way to the back

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:59.539 
there stretch it all the way to the back
so<00:03:56.459> when<00:03:56.730> you<00:03:56.880> push<00:03:57.299> it<00:03:57.450> back<00:03:57.660> the<00:03:58.019> glue<00:03:58.799> it

00:03:59.539 --> 00:03:59.549 
so when you push it back the glue it

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:02.960 
so when you push it back the glue it
goes<00:03:59.790> like<00:04:00.030> back<00:04:00.450> into<00:04:01.140> it<00:04:01.290> and<00:04:01.470> then<00:04:02.400> when<00:04:02.790> you

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
goes like back into it and then when you

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.840 
goes like back into it and then when you
shoot<00:04:03.330> it<00:04:03.930> comes<00:04:04.350> out<00:04:04.500> comes<00:04:04.920> out<00:04:05.160> the<00:04:05.430> dark<00:04:05.670> on

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:05.850 
shoot it comes out comes out the dark on

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:08.330 
shoot it comes out comes out the dark on
this<00:04:05.880> so<00:04:06.299> now<00:04:06.780> all<00:04:06.810> you<00:04:07.200> need<00:04:07.230> is<00:04:07.410> an<00:04:07.650> altar<00:04:08.040> and

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:08.340 
this so now all you need is an altar and

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:15.199 
this so now all you need is an altar and
that<00:04:08.850> you'll<00:04:09.030> need<00:04:09.209> a<00:04:09.420> really<00:04:09.720> strong<00:04:14.209> USB

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209 
that you'll need a really strong USB

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:17.960 
that you'll need a really strong USB
cable<00:04:15.600> is<00:04:15.750> optional<00:04:16.530> so<00:04:16.709> doesn't<00:04:17.190> fall<00:04:17.370> out<00:04:17.400> so

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:17.970 
cable is optional so doesn't fall out so

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:20.000 
cable is optional so doesn't fall out so
after<00:04:18.150> you<00:04:18.419> fix<00:04:18.720> us<00:04:18.840> all<00:04:18.989> up<00:04:19.169> to<00:04:19.320> Krypton<00:04:19.620> also

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:20.010 
after you fix us all up to Krypton also

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:22.730 
after you fix us all up to Krypton also
which<00:04:20.459> is<00:04:20.609> very<00:04:20.789> simple<00:04:21.090> yeah<00:04:21.390> just<00:04:21.780> um<00:04:22.049> you

00:04:50.719 --> 00:04:50.729 
with this part of the pen have to go

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:53.510 
with this part of the pen have to go
back<00:04:51.560> there

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:53.520 
back there

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.610 
back there
push<00:04:54.150> it<00:04:54.300> in<00:04:54.389> a<00:04:54.509> little<00:04:54.539> bit<00:04:55.819> squeeze<00:04:56.819> it<00:04:57.120> and

see you shoot it and look as you sit
with<00:05:16.530> me<00:05:17.419> and<00:05:18.419> that<00:05:18.539> proves<00:05:18.810> with<00:05:19.169> a<00:05:19.199> little

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:19.560 
with me and that proves with a little

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:22.369 
with me and that proves with a little
hard<00:05:19.740> work<00:05:19.949> and<00:05:20.159> determination<00:05:21.020> you<00:05:22.020> can<00:05:22.199> make
