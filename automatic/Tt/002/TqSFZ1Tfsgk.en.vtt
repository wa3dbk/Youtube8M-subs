is<00:02:19.280> dry<00:02:19.610> I<00:02:19.820> can<00:02:20.000> finally<00:02:20.210> put<00:02:20.600> it<00:02:20.690> into<00:02:21.020> the

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
is dry I can finally put it into the

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.680 
is dry I can finally put it into the
ring<00:02:21.320> and<00:02:22.130> you<00:02:22.820> just<00:02:22.940> want<00:02:23.090> to<00:02:23.120> put<00:02:23.300> the<00:02:23.420> flat

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:23.690 
ring and you just want to put the flat

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:25.450 
ring and you just want to put the flat
side<00:02:23.960> down<00:02:23.990> the<00:02:24.620> slide<00:02:24.800> that<00:02:24.950> has<00:02:25.040> the<00:02:25.160> polish

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:25.460 
side down the slide that has the polish

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:29.410 
side down the slide that has the polish
on<00:02:25.610> it<00:02:25.730> down<00:02:25.880> into<00:02:26.060> the<00:02:26.240> ring<00:02:26.450> and<00:02:28.090> then<00:02:29.090> these

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
on it down into the ring and then these

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.140 
on it down into the ring and then these
prongs<00:02:29.840> are<00:02:30.320> pointing<00:02:31.100> straight<00:02:31.400> up<00:02:31.670> because

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
prongs are pointing straight up because

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:34.300 
prongs are pointing straight up because
they<00:02:32.300> want<00:02:32.510> to<00:02:32.570> let<00:02:32.750> you<00:02:32.990> put<00:02:33.620> the<00:02:33.800> stone<00:02:34.100> into

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
they want to let you put the stone into

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.940 
they want to let you put the stone into
the<00:02:34.400> ring<00:02:34.700> before<00:02:34.910> you<00:02:35.180> close<00:02:35.420> the<00:02:35.630> prongs<00:02:35.950> so

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
the ring before you close the prongs so

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:38.920 
the ring before you close the prongs so
next<00:02:37.340> you<00:02:37.430> just<00:02:37.489> need<00:02:37.820> to<00:02:37.910> use<00:02:38.090> a<00:02:38.120> flat<00:02:38.600> surface

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930 
next you just need to use a flat surface

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.220 
next you just need to use a flat surface
