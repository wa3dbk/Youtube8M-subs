there is that competitive spirit in the

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:40.840 
there is that competitive spirit in the
room<00:00:38.900> but<00:00:39.500> at<00:00:39.650> the<00:00:39.769> same<00:00:39.980> time<00:00:40.250> they've<00:00:40.580> you

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:40.850 
room but at the same time they've you

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:42.610 
room but at the same time they've you
know<00:00:40.910> I<00:00:41.150> think<00:00:41.479> there's<00:00:41.659> a<00:00:41.720> level<00:00:42.019> of<00:00:42.199> respect

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:42.620 
know I think there's a level of respect

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.810 
know I think there's a level of respect
between<00:00:42.830> the<00:00:43.159> two<00:00:43.370> and<00:00:44.530> you<00:00:45.530> know<00:00:45.650> it's<00:00:46.640> a<00:00:46.699> good

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:46.820 
between the two and you know it's a good

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.329 
between the two and you know it's a good
situation<00:00:47.110> it<00:00:48.110> last<00:00:48.620> year<00:00:48.920> there<00:00:49.159> was<00:00:49.280> the

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:49.339 
situation it last year there was the

00:00:49.339 --> 00:00:51.520 
situation it last year there was the
dynamic<00:00:49.670> or<00:00:50.239> I<00:00:50.269> guess<00:00:50.659> a<00:00:50.690> couple<00:00:50.930> years<00:00:51.260> ago<00:00:51.379> of
