00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:13.500 
you can have as many rings than you want

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.350 
you can have as many rings than you want
and<00:00:14.040> I'm<00:00:14.190> also<00:00:14.219> gonna<00:00:14.610> if<00:00:14.820> I<00:00:14.940> have<00:00:15.059> time<00:00:15.210> i'm

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:16.500 
going to show you how to make them have

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.910 
going to show you how to make them have
physics<00:00:16.920> and<00:00:17.100> stuff<00:00:17.310> so<00:00:18.439> for<00:00:19.439> the<00:00:19.500> same<00:00:19.680> time

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
physics and stuff so for the same time

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.710 
physics and stuff so for the same time
let's<00:00:20.160> just<00:00:20.340> jump<00:00:20.550> right<00:00:20.670> into<00:00:20.970> this<00:00:21.180> tutorial

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
let's just jump right into this tutorial

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.140 
let's just jump right into this tutorial
so<00:00:22.380> I<00:00:22.439> already<00:00:22.680> have<00:00:22.890> cinema<00:00:23.250> 4d<00:00:23.490> open<00:00:23.939> and

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
so I already have cinema 4d open and

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.540 
so I already have cinema 4d open and
then<00:00:24.869> what<00:00:25.380> we're<00:00:25.500> going<00:00:25.529> to<00:00:25.680> do<00:00:25.859> I<00:00:26.099> like<00:00:26.460> to

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
then what we're going to do I like to

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.150 
then what we're going to do I like to
just<00:00:26.699> add<00:00:26.910> my<00:00:27.090> floor<00:00:27.359> off<00:00:27.810> the<00:00:28.050> bat<00:00:28.410> as<00:00:28.619> you

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
just add my floor off the bat as you

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.560 
just add my floor off the bat as you
guys<00:00:29.279> know<00:00:29.340> I<00:00:29.670> move<00:00:29.910> it<00:00:30.029> down<00:00:30.179> a<00:00:30.210> little<00:00:30.420> bit

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
guys know I move it down a little bit

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:36.380 
guys know I move it down a little bit
and<00:00:30.810> then<00:00:30.869> we<00:00:31.859> add<00:00:32.040> a<00:00:33.079> Taurus<00:00:34.079> and<00:00:35.059> then<00:00:36.059> I

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
and then we add a Taurus and then I

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.720 
and then we add a Taurus and then I
already<00:00:37.079> have<00:00:37.590> done<00:00:37.800> this<00:00:37.980> and<00:00:38.190> I<00:00:38.430> know<00:00:38.489> that

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
already have done this and I know that

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.440 
already have done this and I know that
the<00:00:39.050> radius<00:00:40.050> a<00:00:40.200> pretty<00:00:40.469> good<00:00:40.649> one<00:00:40.770> is<00:00:40.890> 60<00:00:41.309> and<00:00:41.520> I

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
the radius a pretty good one is 60 and I

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.660 
the radius a pretty good one is 60 and I
ring<00:00:42.750> segment<00:00:42.989> 60s<00:00:43.739> just<00:00:44.010> made<00:00:44.190> it<00:00:44.280> be<00:00:44.399> really

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
ring segment 60s just made it be really

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.600 
ring segment 60s just made it be really
smooth<00:00:45.030> site<00:00:45.329> and<00:00:45.739> for<00:00:46.739> the<00:00:46.829> final<00:00:46.980> render<00:00:47.460> you

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
smooth site and for the final render you

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:50.720 
smooth site and for the final render you
can<00:00:47.760> pump<00:00:48.059> that<00:00:48.270> up<00:00:48.329> a<00:00:48.570> ton<00:00:49.039> because<00:00:50.039> that'll

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
can pump that up a ton because that'll

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:56.290 
can pump that up a ton because that'll
make<00:00:50.879> it<00:00:50.940> look<00:00:51.390> really<00:00:51.690> good<00:00:51.870> and<00:00:52.879> pipe<00:00:53.879> radius

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:56.300 
make it look really good and pipe radius

00:00:56.300 --> 00:01:02.750 
make it look really good and pipe radius
30<00:00:58.190> and<00:00:59.480> then<00:01:00.480> now<00:01:01.079> well<00:01:01.920> no<00:01:02.129> pipe<00:01:02.430> radius

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
30 and then now well no pipe radius

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.870 
30 and then now well no pipe radius
would<00:01:02.940> be<00:01:03.210> 15<00:01:03.930> and<00:01:04.199> that's<00:01:04.680> a<00:01:04.830> very<00:01:05.010> good<00:01:05.460> right

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
would be 15 and that's a very good right

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.440 
would be 15 and that's a very good right
there<00:01:06.920> or<00:01:07.920> you<00:01:08.340> can<00:01:08.460> just<00:01:08.640> change<00:01:09.150> it<00:01:09.330> to

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
there or you can just change it to

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:11.510 
there or you can just change it to
however<00:01:09.659> you<00:01:10.049> like<00:01:10.260> and<00:01:10.560> then<00:01:11.250> we're<00:01:11.369> going<00:01:11.460> to

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
however you like and then we're going to

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.190 
however you like and then we're going to
add<00:01:11.610> a<00:01:12.350> cylinder<00:01:13.350> right<00:01:13.560> here<00:01:13.830> and<00:01:14.960> as<00:01:15.960> you<00:01:16.080> can

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
add a cylinder right here and as you can

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.429 
add a cylinder right here and as you can
see<00:01:16.229> it's<00:01:16.920> already<00:01:17.479> kind<00:01:18.479> of<00:01:18.540> see<00:01:19.110> something

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
see it's already kind of see something

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:22.760 
see it's already kind of see something
change<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:20.250> radius<00:01:20.549> to<00:01:20.759> 60<00:01:21.380> and<00:01:22.380> it<00:01:22.470> doesn't

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 
change the radius to 60 and it doesn't

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.020 
change the radius to 60 and it doesn't
matter<00:01:22.890> what<00:01:23.070> you<00:01:23.159> leave<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.460> high<00:01:23.610> does<00:01:23.820> as

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
matter what you leave the high does as

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.179 
matter what you leave the high does as
long<00:01:24.060> as<00:01:24.360> you<00:01:24.420> don't<00:01:24.600> make<00:01:24.750> it<00:01:24.810> to<00:01:25.080> just<00:01:25.979> leave

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
long as you don't make it to just leave

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:29.899 
long as you don't make it to just leave
it<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.369> same<00:01:27.110> and<00:01:28.110> then<00:01:28.579> then<00:01:29.579> we're<00:01:29.729> going<00:01:29.850> to

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
it the same and then then we're going to

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:32.899 
it the same and then then we're going to
drop<00:01:30.119> that<00:01:30.329> under<00:01:30.659> a<00:01:30.689> bull<00:01:31.380> I'm<00:01:32.280> not<00:01:32.520> too<00:01:32.729> sure

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
drop that under a bull I'm not too sure

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.580 
drop that under a bull I'm not too sure
which<00:01:33.119> one<00:01:33.299> goes<00:01:33.509> first<00:01:33.810> i'm<00:01:34.229> pretty<00:01:34.409> sure

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
which one goes first i'm pretty sure

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:35.899 
which one goes first i'm pretty sure
they're<00:01:34.710> tourists<00:01:35.100> who<00:01:35.220> is<00:01:35.280> first<00:01:35.520> there<00:01:35.820> we

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
they're tourists who is first there we

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.649 
they're tourists who is first there we
go<00:01:36.090> and<00:01:36.600> if<00:01:37.530> we<00:01:37.680> do<00:01:37.799> a<00:01:37.829> quick<00:01:38.100> render<00:01:38.460> out

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:38.659 
go and if we do a quick render out

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:40.940 
go and if we do a quick render out
already<00:01:39.659> got<00:01:39.869> the<00:01:39.960> shape<00:01:40.170> we<00:01:40.439> already<00:01:40.799> got

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:40.950 
already got the shape we already got

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.999 
already got the shape we already got
that<00:01:41.159> part<00:01:41.579> and<00:01:42.210> then<00:01:42.780> what<00:01:43.710> we're<00:01:43.829> going<00:01:43.860> to

00:01:43.999 --> 00:01:44.009 
that part and then what we're going to

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.230 
that part and then what we're going to
do<00:01:44.130> is<00:01:44.250> just<00:01:44.430> make<00:01:44.490> a<00:01:44.610> texture<00:01:45.470> color<00:01:47.090> get<00:01:48.090> it<00:01:48.180> a

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
do is just make a texture color get it a

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.179 
do is just make a texture color get it a
nice<00:01:48.390> gold<00:01:48.780> you<00:01:49.079> can<00:01:49.200> like<00:01:49.350> make<00:01:49.590> it<00:01:49.740> a<00:01:49.829> silver

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
nice gold you can like make it a silver

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:55.130 
nice gold you can like make it a silver
ring<00:01:50.220> I<00:01:50.899> prefer<00:01:51.899> gold<00:01:52.409> actually<00:01:53.450> and<00:01:54.450> then

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
ring I prefer gold actually and then

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.950 
ring I prefer gold actually and then
just<00:01:55.829> and<00:01:56.670> then<00:01:56.939> we're<00:01:57.090> gold<00:01:57.240> will<00:01:57.659> go<00:01:57.780> to<00:01:57.840> the

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
just and then we're gold will go to the

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.450 
just and then we're gold will go to the
luminance<00:01:58.320> remembering<00:01:58.740> to<00:01:58.829> check<00:01:59.070> these<00:01:59.219> off

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
luminance remembering to check these off

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.510 
luminance remembering to check these off
it<00:02:00.299> isn't<00:02:00.540> it<00:02:00.600> bad<00:02:00.750> to<00:02:00.930> like<00:02:01.049> a<00:02:01.229> good<00:02:01.439> like<00:02:01.619> 20

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
it isn't it bad to like a good like 20

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:05.450 
it isn't it bad to like a good like 20
something<00:02:02.790> lower<00:02:03.540> 20s<00:02:04.130> and<00:02:05.130> then<00:02:05.250> we'll<00:02:05.340> go<00:02:05.430> to

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
something lower 20s and then we'll go to

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:08.330 
something lower 20s and then we'll go to
reflection<00:02:06.090> check<00:02:06.509> it<00:02:06.689> I<00:02:07.009> always<00:02:08.009> liked

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
reflection check it I always liked

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:11.089 
reflection check it I always liked
Fresnel<00:02:09.300> right<00:02:09.509> here<00:02:09.840> just<00:02:10.739> makes<00:02:10.920> everything

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
Fresnel right here just makes everything

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.400 
Fresnel right here just makes everything
look<00:02:11.340> better

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
look better

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.430 
look better
yeah<00:02:13.300> and<00:02:14.300> then<00:02:14.420> we'll<00:02:14.720> just<00:02:14.930> drop<00:02:15.170> it<00:02:15.230> right

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:15.440 
yeah and then we'll just drop it right

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.990 
yeah and then we'll just drop it right
up<00:02:15.830> here<00:02:15.980> under<00:02:16.220> the<00:02:16.340> pool<00:02:17.500> and<00:02:18.500> then<00:02:19.430> you've

00:02:19.990 --> 00:02:20.000 
up here under the pool and then you've

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.740 
up here under the pool and then you've
got<00:02:20.030> pretty<00:02:20.600> much<00:02:20.840> it<00:02:21.020> and<00:02:21.700> then<00:02:22.700> but<00:02:23.540> like

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:23.750 
got pretty much it and then but like

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.620 
got pretty much it and then but like
what's<00:02:23.960> wrong<00:02:24.110> here<00:02:24.470> is<00:02:24.790> it<00:02:25.790> you<00:02:26.240> can<00:02:26.360> see<00:02:26.510> all

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:26.630 
what's wrong here is it you can see all

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:28.480 
what's wrong here is it you can see all
the<00:02:26.660> outside<00:02:27.230> what<00:02:27.860> we<00:02:27.950> need<00:02:28.100> to<00:02:28.160> do<00:02:28.280> now<00:02:28.460> is

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:28.490 
the outside what we need to do now is

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:32.200 
the outside what we need to do now is
make<00:02:28.850> a<00:02:28.910> light<00:02:30.370> well<00:02:31.370> we<00:02:31.640> don't<00:02:31.790> even<00:02:31.910> need<00:02:32.090> to

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:32.210 
make a light well we don't even need to

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:33.550 
make a light well we don't even need to
move<00:02:32.330> it<00:02:32.480> don't<00:02:32.660> even<00:02:32.840> move<00:02:33.080> it<00:02:33.260> and<00:02:33.380> then

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:33.560 
move it don't even move it and then

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:36.070 
move it don't even move it and then
we'll<00:02:33.710> go<00:02:33.860> here<00:02:34.250> just<00:02:35.150> click<00:02:35.390> on<00:02:35.540> it<00:02:35.690> and<00:02:35.780> then

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:36.080 
we'll go here just click on it and then

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.110 
we'll go here just click on it and then
we'll<00:02:36.260> have<00:02:36.440> an<00:02:36.590> array<00:02:36.860> and<00:02:37.670> we<00:02:37.700> drop<00:02:38.000> the

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120 
we'll have an array and we drop the

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.970 
we'll have an array and we drop the
light<00:02:38.330> underneath<00:02:38.690> the<00:02:38.960> array<00:02:39.110> and<00:02:39.380> then

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:39.980 
light underneath the array and then

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.700 
light underneath the array and then
we've<00:02:40.160> got<00:02:40.190> a<00:02:40.370> nice<00:02:40.580> little<00:02:40.850> and<00:02:41.360> then<00:02:41.720> we've

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:42.710 
we've got a nice little and then we've

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:46.600 
we've got a nice little and then we've
got<00:02:42.740> like<00:02:43.070> seven<00:02:44.080> lights<00:02:45.080> right<00:02:45.320> here<00:02:45.610> we're

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
got like seven lights right here we're

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.020 
got like seven lights right here we're
going<00:02:46.700> to<00:02:46.790> raise<00:02:46.970> it<00:02:47.150> up<00:02:48.250> bring<00:02:49.250> the<00:02:49.400> radius<00:02:49.820> to

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:50.030 
going to raise it up bring the radius to

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:56.220 
going to raise it up bring the radius to
around<00:02:50.530> 350<00:02:52.660> now<00:02:53.660> let's<00:02:53.930> try<00:02:54.080> four<00:02:54.380> hundred

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
around 350 now let's try four hundred

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.380 
around 350 now let's try four hundred
and<00:02:57.230> then<00:02:57.380> see<00:02:57.620> it<00:02:58.100> overpower<00:02:58.850> simply<00:02:59.210> now

00:02:59.380 --> 00:02:59.390 
and then see it overpower simply now

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:01.450 
and then see it overpower simply now
we'll<00:02:59.600> go<00:02:59.720> to<00:02:59.780> light<00:03:00.170> and<00:03:00.860> turn<00:03:00.980> it<00:03:01.100> down<00:03:01.220> to

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:01.460 
we'll go to light and turn it down to

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:05.770 
we'll go to light and turn it down to
around<00:03:01.550> 20<00:03:02.210> 24<00:03:04.150> that's<00:03:05.150> still<00:03:05.420> a<00:03:05.480> little<00:03:05.630> bit

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
around 20 24 that's still a little bit

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:14.290 
around 20 24 that's still a little bit
too<00:03:05.930> high<00:03:06.110> maybe<00:03:09.130> 20<00:03:10.130> let's<00:03:10.520> try<00:03:10.730> that<00:03:13.300> it's

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:14.300 
too high maybe 20 let's try that it's

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.870 
too high maybe 20 let's try that it's
not<00:03:14.390> perfect<00:03:14.840> but<00:03:14.900> it's<00:03:15.020> okay<00:03:15.620> it's<00:03:16.370> kind<00:03:16.820> of

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:16.880 
not perfect but it's okay it's kind of

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.060 
not perfect but it's okay it's kind of
too<00:03:17.030> bright<00:03:17.270> I<00:03:17.510> know<00:03:18.410> what<00:03:18.560> we<00:03:18.680> can<00:03:18.709> do<00:03:18.890> we<00:03:19.040> can

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:19.070 
too bright I know what we can do we can

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:21.550 
too bright I know what we can do we can
turn<00:03:19.340> the<00:03:19.490> radius<00:03:19.820> of<00:03:20.000> the<00:03:20.420> array<00:03:21.080> up<00:03:21.320> higher

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
turn the radius of the array up higher

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.949 
turn the radius of the array up higher
to<00:03:21.590> maybe<00:03:22.100> 500<00:03:22.730> and<00:03:22.970> then<00:03:23.120> it<00:03:23.360> won't<00:03:23.480> reflect

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:23.959 
to maybe 500 and then it won't reflect

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:27.430 
to maybe 500 and then it won't reflect
too<00:03:24.290> bad<00:03:24.590> into<00:03:24.980> that<00:03:25.130> middle<00:03:25.850> as<00:03:26.180> much<00:03:26.510> and

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 
too bad into that middle as much and

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.730 
too bad into that middle as much and
then<00:03:28.400> I<00:03:28.430> always<00:03:28.700> liked<00:03:28.910> it<00:03:29.090> just<00:03:29.180> shader<00:03:29.740> file

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:30.740 
then I always liked it just shader file

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:33.820 
then I always liked it just shader file
shader<00:03:31.240> new<00:03:32.240> key<00:03:32.480> let's<00:03:33.080> put<00:03:33.290> that<00:03:33.410> on<00:03:33.470> the

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:33.830 
shader new key let's put that on the

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:36.850 
shader new key let's put that on the
floor<00:03:34.900> and<00:03:35.900> I<00:03:36.110> give<00:03:36.290> you<00:03:36.410> a<00:03:36.440> nice<00:03:36.620> little

00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:36.860 
floor and I give you a nice little

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:38.650 
floor and I give you a nice little
reflection<00:03:37.280> give<00:03:37.670> it<00:03:37.760> some<00:03:37.910> blue<00:03:38.090> tint<00:03:38.450> in

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:38.660 
reflection give it some blue tint in

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:41.020 
reflection give it some blue tint in
there<00:03:39.220> of<00:03:40.220> course<00:03:40.520> you<00:03:40.670> can<00:03:40.790> do<00:03:40.880> whatever

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:41.030 
there of course you can do whatever

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:45.160 
there of course you can do whatever
color<00:03:41.390> you<00:03:41.540> want<00:03:41.570> it's<00:03:41.870> tough<00:03:42.140> and<00:03:43.989> to<00:03:44.989> make

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:45.170 
color you want it's tough and to make

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:48.460 
color you want it's tough and to make
the<00:03:45.970> little<00:03:46.970> seemed<00:03:47.300> that<00:03:47.420> I<00:03:47.480> had<00:03:47.540> what<00:03:48.440> you

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:48.470 
the little seemed that I had what you

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:54.550 
the little seemed that I had what you
let's<00:03:48.739> do<00:03:48.860> is<00:03:50.440> control<00:03:51.440> C<00:03:51.680> control<00:03:51.709> V<00:03:52.420> and<00:03:53.560> then

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 
let's do is control C control V and then

00:03:54.560 --> 00:04:03.580 
let's do is control C control V and then
just<00:03:55.310> move<00:03:55.730> it<00:03:55.910> down<00:03:57.640> rotate<00:03:59.020> rotate<00:04:00.730> and<00:04:02.590> I'm

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590 
just move it down rotate rotate and I'm

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:05.140 
just move it down rotate rotate and I'm
not<00:04:03.770> going<00:04:03.890> to<00:04:03.950> be<00:04:04.010> able<00:04:04.040> to<00:04:04.250> do<00:04:04.370> this<00:04:04.489> hole<00:04:04.700> is

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.150 
not going to be able to do this hole is

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:07.660 
not going to be able to do this hole is
for<00:04:05.600> the<00:04:05.660> sake<00:04:05.810> of<00:04:05.840> time<00:04:06.110> I<00:04:06.410> don't<00:04:07.400> know<00:04:07.550> if

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:07.670 
for the sake of time I don't know if

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:09.190 
for the sake of time I don't know if
this<00:04:07.790> is<00:04:07.880> going<00:04:08.060> to<00:04:08.150> take<00:04:08.690> too<00:04:08.870> long<00:04:08.989> during

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:09.200 
this is going to take too long during

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.280 
this is going to take too long during
the<00:04:09.380> next<00:04:09.560> tutorial<00:04:10.040> on<00:04:10.700> it<00:04:11.150> but<00:04:11.750> you'll<00:04:12.140> just

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:12.290 
the next tutorial on it but you'll just

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:14.830 
the next tutorial on it but you'll just
move<00:04:12.560> this<00:04:12.739> to<00:04:12.950> where<00:04:13.070> they<00:04:13.580> don't<00:04:13.790> overlap<00:04:14.060> so

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:14.840 
move this to where they don't overlap so

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:15.940 
move this to where they don't overlap so
I'm<00:04:14.930> going<00:04:15.050> to<00:04:15.080> go<00:04:15.200> ahead<00:04:15.230> and<00:04:15.440> delete<00:04:15.620> this

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:15.950 
I'm going to go ahead and delete this

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:19.599 
I'm going to go ahead and delete this
and<00:04:16.130> this<00:04:16.940> is<00:04:17.000> going<00:04:17.299> to<00:04:17.359> be<00:04:17.450> for<00:04:17.660> the<00:04:18.609> physics

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:19.609 
and this is going to be for the physics

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:22.810 
and this is going to be for the physics
thing<00:04:19.730> of<00:04:20.120> a<00:04:20.299> actual<00:04:20.900> range<00:04:21.140> open<00:04:21.530> now<00:04:22.010> we're

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:22.820 
thing of a actual range open now we're

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:25.280

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:30.710 
mogra cloner object and drop the bull
right<00:04:29.380> underneath<00:04:29.680> that<00:04:29.890> you'll<00:04:30.070> see<00:04:30.280> three

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 
right underneath that you'll see three

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.810 
right underneath that you'll see three
we<00:04:31.720> only<00:04:31.870> want<00:04:32.110> one<00:04:32.290> two<00:04:32.500> down<00:04:32.710> here<00:04:33.010> on<00:04:33.190> the

you have Kelowna I'll be collected we'll

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:40.950 
you have Kelowna I'll be collected we'll
go<00:04:37.900> down<00:04:38.200> to<00:04:38.380> one<00:04:38.670> and<00:04:39.670> bring<00:04:40.480> the<00:04:40.720> cloner

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:40.960 
go down to one and bring the cloner

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:47.640 
go down to one and bring the cloner
object<00:04:41.440> of<00:04:41.950> all<00:04:44.970> right<00:04:45.970> there<00:04:46.180> now<00:04:46.870> if<00:04:47.410> you

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:47.650 
object of all right there now if you

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:49.560 
object of all right there now if you
just<00:04:47.830> fell<00:04:48.130> right<00:04:48.160> there<00:04:48.490> it<00:04:48.790> wouldn't<00:04:49.420> look

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:49.570 
just fell right there it wouldn't look

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:51.180 
just fell right there it wouldn't look
very<00:04:49.630> cool<00:04:50.020> we<00:04:50.170> got<00:04:50.290> to<00:04:50.440> get<00:04:50.560> it<00:04:50.710> a<00:04:50.770> little<00:04:50.920> bit

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:51.190 
very cool we got to get it a little bit

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:53.910 
very cool we got to get it a little bit
of<00:04:51.310> a<00:04:51.400> nice<00:04:51.610> rotation<00:04:51.910> on<00:04:52.690> it<00:04:52.870> just<00:04:53.530> a<00:04:53.680> slight

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:53.920 
of a nice rotation on it just a slight

00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:55.650 
of a nice rotation on it just a slight
slight<00:04:54.340> one<00:04:54.580> you<00:04:54.760> don't<00:04:54.820> want<00:04:54.910> to<00:04:55.090> go<00:04:55.180> bouncing

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:55.660 
slight one you don't want to go bouncing

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:58.830 
slight one you don't want to go bouncing
all<00:04:55.780> over<00:04:55.960> the<00:04:56.050> place<00:04:56.220> but<00:04:57.220> I<00:04:57.540> that<00:04:58.540> looks

00:04:58.830 --> 00:04:58.840 
all over the place but I that looks

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.320 
all over the place but I that looks
pretty<00:04:59.050> good<00:04:59.140> to<00:04:59.560> me<00:04:59.590> and<00:05:00.550> now<00:05:00.730> we<00:05:01.030> got<00:05:01.180> to<00:05:01.270> go

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:01.330 
pretty good to me and now we got to go

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:04.290 
pretty good to me and now we got to go
to<00:05:01.420> the<00:05:01.510> final<00:05:01.750> thing<00:05:01.870> is<00:05:02.200> easy<00:05:02.830> just<00:05:03.270> drag<00:05:04.270> and

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:04.300 
to the final thing is easy just drag and

and<00:05:16.000> it's<00:05:16.450> the<00:05:16.810> only<00:05:17.020> way<00:05:17.140> I<00:05:17.170> know<00:05:17.320> how<00:05:17.440> to<00:05:17.590> make

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:17.680 
and it's the only way I know how to make

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:20.400 
and it's the only way I know how to make
physics<00:05:18.430> like<00:05:18.580> I<00:05:18.790> don't<00:05:18.850> I've<00:05:19.150> tried<00:05:20.110> seeing

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:20.410 
physics like I don't I've tried seeing

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:21.960 
physics like I don't I've tried seeing
everywhere<00:05:20.830> else<00:05:20.980> nobody<00:05:21.430> else<00:05:21.610> seems<00:05:21.850> to

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:21.970 
everywhere else nobody else seems to

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:24.150 
everywhere else nobody else seems to
know<00:05:22.030> how<00:05:22.300> to<00:05:23.110> make<00:05:23.230> everything<00:05:23.530> something

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:24.160 
know how to make everything something

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:25.980 
know how to make everything something
have<00:05:24.280> physics<00:05:24.700> without<00:05:24.910> putting<00:05:25.480> it<00:05:25.690> under<00:05:25.960> a

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:25.990 
have physics without putting it under a

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:28.980 
have physics without putting it under a
cloner<00:05:26.290> of<00:05:26.470> it<00:05:26.620> so<00:05:26.800> remember<00:05:27.220> that<00:05:27.300> and<00:05:28.300> then

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:28.990 
cloner of it so remember that and then

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:34.650 
cloner of it so remember that and then
we'll<00:05:29.230> see<00:05:30.180> we'll<00:05:31.180> probably<00:05:31.450> need<00:05:31.780> to<00:05:33.660> that's

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:34.660 
we'll see we'll probably need to that's

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:38.460 
we'll see we'll probably need to that's
a<00:05:34.900> nice<00:05:35.080> effect<00:05:35.350> there<00:05:36.070> we<00:05:36.220> go<00:05:36.750> turn<00:05:37.750> pump<00:05:38.320> this

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:38.470 
a nice effect there we go turn pump this

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:45.200 
a nice effect there we go turn pump this
up<00:05:38.650> to<00:05:38.830> maybe<00:05:38.980> 300

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:45.210 

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:49.230 

get<00:05:46.210> down<00:05:47.460> and<00:05:48.460> it's<00:05:48.670> always<00:05:48.790> the<00:05:49.000> same<00:05:49.030> and

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:49.240 
get down and it's always the same and

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:51.870 
get down and it's always the same and
then<00:05:49.690> you<00:05:49.810> can<00:05:49.960> like<00:05:50.340> mess<00:05:51.340> with<00:05:51.520> it<00:05:51.550> see<00:05:51.790> how

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:51.880 
then you can like mess with it see how

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:55.080 
then you can like mess with it see how
you<00:05:51.940> like<00:05:52.210> it<00:05:52.620> that<00:05:53.620> this<00:05:54.220> was<00:05:54.460> perfect<00:05:54.730> it's

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:55.090 
you like it that this was perfect it's

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:58.710 
you like it that this was perfect it's
got<00:05:55.240> that<00:05:55.390> nice<00:05:55.570> little<00:05:56.640> ring<00:05:57.640> effect<00:05:58.510> it's

00:05:58.710 --> 00:05:58.720 
got that nice little ring effect it's

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:03.750 
got that nice little ring effect it's
like<00:05:58.870> a<00:05:59.080> coin<00:05:59.590> and<00:06:01.830> then<00:06:02.830> see<00:06:03.040> another<00:06:03.460> thing

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:03.760 
like a coin and then see another thing

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:05.730 
like a coin and then see another thing

earlier if you're going to take the pic

00:06:07.330 --> 00:06:09.690 
earlier if you're going to take the pic
make<00:06:07.630> it<00:06:07.720> just<00:06:07.960> one<00:06:08.200> picture<00:06:08.470> you<00:06:09.220> can<00:06:09.370> pump<00:06:09.580> up

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:09.700 
make it just one picture you can pump up

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:12.950 
make it just one picture you can pump up
