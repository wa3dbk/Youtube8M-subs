that's<00:00:25.019> usual<00:00:25.590> there<00:00:26.010> was<00:00:26.039> no<00:00:26.279> controller

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
that's usual there was no controller

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.700 
that's usual there was no controller
with<00:00:27.029> it<00:00:27.180> in<00:00:27.359> charity<00:00:28.019> shops<00:00:28.289> that<00:00:28.529> very

with it in charity shops that very

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.999 
with it in charity shops that very
rarely<00:00:28.980> is<00:00:29.250> a<00:00:29.279> controller<00:00:29.820> and<00:00:30.740> it<00:00:31.740> was<00:00:31.830> down

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
rarely is a controller and it was down

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.010 
rarely is a controller and it was down
$4.99<00:00:32.250> pence<00:00:33.469> so<00:00:34.469> I<00:00:34.530> thought<00:00:34.710> I'd<00:00:34.860> have<00:00:35.100> it

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:36.020 
$4.99 pence so I thought I'd have it

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.959 
$4.99 pence so I thought I'd have it
even<00:00:37.020> if<00:00:37.260> we<00:00:37.320> can't<00:00:37.620> get<00:00:37.770> it<00:00:37.890> to<00:00:38.010> work<00:00:38.040> it<00:00:38.850> will

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
even if we can't get it to work it will

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.389 
even if we can't get it to work it will
have<00:00:39.180> at<00:00:39.450> least<00:00:39.480> two<00:00:40.020> electric<00:00:40.770> motors<00:00:41.129> in<00:00:41.280> it

00:00:41.389 --> 00:00:41.399 
have at least two electric motors in it

00:00:41.399 --> 00:00:43.069 
have at least two electric motors in it
it<00:00:41.520> has<00:00:41.640> a<00:00:41.700> small<00:00:42.059> one<00:00:42.210> at<00:00:42.329> the<00:00:42.420> back<00:00:42.570> here<00:00:42.840> on

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
it has a small one at the back here on

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.760 
it has a small one at the back here on
the<00:00:43.200> tail<00:00:44.000> another<00:00:45.000> one<00:00:45.210> inside<00:00:46.110> they're<00:00:46.500> well

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
the tail another one inside they're well

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:54.080 
the tail another one inside they're well
geared<00:00:48.140> so<00:00:49.140> run<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:49.770> rotors<00:00:50.190> I<00:00:52.070> thought<00:00:53.090> well

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
geared so run the rotors I thought well

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.479 
geared so run the rotors I thought well
it'd<00:00:54.360> be<00:00:54.480> worth<00:00:54.660> having<00:00:54.870> just<00:00:55.199> for<00:00:55.350> that<00:00:55.500> I<00:00:55.739> do

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
it'd be worth having just for that I do

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:03.170 
it'd be worth having just for that I do
actually<00:00:56.820> have<00:01:00.890> the<00:01:01.890> radio-controlled<00:01:02.670> not

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
actually have the radio-controlled not

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.050 
actually have the radio-controlled not

helicopter<00:01:06.060> of<00:01:06.150> my<00:01:06.299> own<00:01:06.450> already<00:01:06.770> had<00:01:07.770> it<00:01:07.890> so

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
helicopter of my own already had it so

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.469 
helicopter of my own already had it so
long<00:01:08.369> that<00:01:08.430> it<00:01:08.970> actually<00:01:10.939> can't<00:01:11.939> quite<00:01:12.299> get

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
long that it actually can't quite get

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.210 
long that it actually can't quite get
off<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.810> ground<00:01:13.020> or<00:01:13.290> at<00:01:13.380> least<00:01:13.500> if<00:01:13.650> it<00:01:13.799> goes<00:01:14.010> up

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
off the ground or at least if it goes up

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.640 
off the ground or at least if it goes up
about<00:01:14.520> six<00:01:15.390> inches<00:01:15.810> and<00:01:16.049> then<00:01:16.200> the<00:01:16.350> rest<00:01:16.530> of

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
about six inches and then the rest of

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:23.200 
about six inches and then the rest of
its<00:01:16.799> flights<00:01:17.100> downhill<00:01:20.330> work<00:01:21.330> at<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.600> moment

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.210 
its flights downhill work at the moment

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:33.780 
its flights downhill work at the moment
let's<00:01:24.210> switch<00:01:24.479> it<00:01:24.509> on<00:01:24.780> and<00:01:24.900> have<00:01:24.960> a<00:01:25.020> look

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:33.790 

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:48.560 

wants<00:01:34.790> to<00:01:34.820> go

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:50.969 

we<00:01:49.570> can<00:01:49.750> probably<00:01:49.869> hear<00:01:50.200> it<00:01:50.350> dying<00:01:50.590> on<00:01:50.859> the

00:01:50.969 --> 00:01:50.979 
we can probably hear it dying on the

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:54.060 
we can probably hear it dying on the
floor<00:01:51.219> there<00:01:52.229> yes<00:01:53.229> it<00:01:53.380> had<00:01:53.469> enough<00:01:53.710> lift<00:01:53.979> to

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.070 
floor there yes it had enough lift to

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:55.919 
floor there yes it had enough lift to
get<00:01:54.250> it<00:01:54.340> off<00:01:54.460> the<00:01:54.490> table<00:01:55.000> and<00:01:55.119> then<00:01:55.299> go

00:01:55.919 --> 00:01:55.929 
get it off the table and then go

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:58.709 
get it off the table and then go
downhill<00:01:56.200> after<00:01:56.649> that<00:01:56.950> but<00:01:57.880> that<00:01:58.030> does<00:01:58.240> mean<00:01:58.270> I

00:01:58.709 --> 00:01:58.719 
downhill after that but that does mean I

00:01:58.719 --> 00:02:03.870 
downhill after that but that does mean I
do<00:01:58.840> actually<00:01:59.259> have<00:01:59.320> a<00:01:59.380> controller<00:02:00.390> so<00:02:02.880> I've

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:03.880 
do actually have a controller so I've

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:07.529 
do actually have a controller so I've
plugged<00:02:04.270> the<00:02:04.450> charger<00:02:04.929> in<00:02:05.079> to<00:02:05.649> this<00:02:05.799> and<00:02:06.539> it

00:02:07.529 --> 00:02:07.539 
plugged the charger in to this and it

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:11.789 
plugged the charger in to this and it
has<00:02:07.750> taken<00:02:08.110> charge<00:02:09.869> just<00:02:10.869> don't<00:02:11.620> know<00:02:11.680> if<00:02:11.739> you

00:02:11.789 --> 00:02:11.799 
has taken charge just don't know if you

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:14.759 
has taken charge just don't know if you
can<00:02:11.890> see<00:02:12.190> there<00:02:12.959> little<00:02:13.959> blue<00:02:14.140> lights<00:02:14.410> come<00:02:14.739> on

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:14.769 
can see there little blue lights come on

00:02:14.769 --> 00:02:17.759 
can see there little blue lights come on
and<00:02:15.129> a<00:02:15.310> flashing<00:02:15.610> red<00:02:15.790> and<00:02:16.090> blues<00:02:16.650> working<00:02:17.650> at

00:02:17.759 --> 00:02:17.769 
and a flashing red and blues working at

00:02:17.769 --> 00:02:23.339 
and a flashing red and blues working at
the<00:02:17.860> front<00:02:17.980> there<00:02:18.660> but<00:02:20.400> it's<00:02:21.400> not<00:02:21.519> enough<00:02:22.349> or

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:23.349 
the front there but it's not enough or

00:02:23.349 --> 00:02:25.050 
the front there but it's not enough or
at<00:02:23.500> least<00:02:23.650> it's<00:02:24.069> not<00:02:24.160> actually<00:02:24.670> on<00:02:24.760> the<00:02:24.849> same

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.060 
at least it's not actually on the same

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:28.979 
at least it's not actually on the same
frequency<00:02:25.950> that's<00:02:26.950> this<00:02:27.160> one<00:02:27.690> so<00:02:28.690> we've<00:02:28.870> got

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:28.989 
frequency that's this one so we've got

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:32.970 
frequency that's this one so we've got
three<00:02:29.319> settings<00:02:29.739> here<00:02:30.010> ABC<00:02:31.170> but<00:02:32.170> it<00:02:32.620> doesn't

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:32.980 
three settings here ABC but it doesn't

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:37.710 
three settings here ABC but it doesn't
respond<00:02:33.430> to<00:02:33.579> any<00:02:33.790> of<00:02:33.910> them<00:02:34.799> so<00:02:36.420> the<00:02:37.420> charity

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:37.720 
respond to any of them so the charity

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.080 
respond to any of them so the charity
shot<00:02:38.079> the<00:02:38.200> gold<00:02:38.410> or<00:02:38.560> garbage<00:02:39.040> if<00:02:39.459> I<00:02:39.640> was<00:02:39.819> just

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090 
shot the gold or garbage if I was just

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.600 
shot the gold or garbage if I was just
buying<00:02:40.989> this<00:02:41.319> completely<00:02:41.799> without<00:02:42.400> any

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:42.610 
buying this completely without any

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:46.410 
buying this completely without any
knowledge<00:02:43.049> then<00:02:44.099> as<00:02:45.099> a<00:02:45.160> toy<00:02:45.459> it<00:02:45.970> looks<00:02:46.180> like<00:02:46.390> a

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:46.420 
knowledge then as a toy it looks like a

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:47.069 
knowledge then as a toy it looks like a
helicopter

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:47.079 
helicopter

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:51.449 
helicopter
it<00:02:47.650> is<00:02:47.799> a<00:02:47.829> helicopter<00:02:48.459> so<00:02:48.670> that's<00:02:49.599> fine<00:02:50.459> that's

00:02:51.449 --> 00:02:51.459 
it is a helicopter so that's fine that's

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:54.030 
it is a helicopter so that's fine that's
a<00:02:51.579> working<00:02:51.819> toy<00:02:52.299> without<00:02:52.840> the<00:02:53.139> controller<00:02:53.560> and

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
a working toy without the controller and

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:57.300 
a working toy without the controller and
obviously<00:02:54.940> without<00:02:55.120> the<00:02:55.389> charger<00:02:55.959> then<00:02:56.739> it's

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
obviously without the charger then it's
