00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:28.340
 just catch up with a pancake how pisses me off 

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:31.070

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:43.280

 there on him dad just an arrow when 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:58.820
 I ask you to see it probably because of 

00:04:56.450 --> 00:04:59.660
 Moreover, I do not agree that the second time 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:02.270
 missed 

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:06.380

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:09.500

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:11.120
 I know it can like were taken out 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:14.060

 how much we have accumulated and unnecessary things 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:28.210
 we generally would have calmly thrown out but damn 

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:31.130

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:33.290
