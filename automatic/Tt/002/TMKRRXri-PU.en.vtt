just a look at the packaging step out of

00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:30.190 
just a look at the packaging step out of
the<00:07:26.940> way

00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:30.200 

00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:32.900 

actually<00:07:31.200> purchased<00:07:31.560> two<00:07:31.800> of<00:07:31.950> these<00:07:32.070> three<00:07:32.790> in

00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:32.910 
actually purchased two of these three in

00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:34.460 
actually purchased two of these three in

then I've got one to keep in the package

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:39.530 
then I've got one to keep in the package
so<00:07:38.310> there<00:07:38.460> you<00:07:38.580> have<00:07:38.730> the<00:07:38.820> actual<00:07:38.970> packaged
