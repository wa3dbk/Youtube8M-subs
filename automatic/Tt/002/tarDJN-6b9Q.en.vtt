00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:45.150 
shape now we're going to try to

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:47.180 
shape now we're going to try to
penetrate<00:05:45.660> this<00:05:46.050> wall<00:05:46.200> next<00:05:46.770> to<00:05:46.890> the<00:05:47.040> town

hole<00:05:47.430> right<00:05:47.700> here<00:05:47.760> and<00:05:48.180> hopefully<00:05:49.140> by<00:05:49.590> the<00:05:49.650> way

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:49.830 
hole right here and hopefully by the way

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:52.070 
hole right here and hopefully by the way
I'm<00:05:50.040> sure<00:05:50.070> he<00:05:50.460> has<00:05:50.610> either<00:05:50.850> John<00:05:51.600> bombs<00:05:51.870> there

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:52.080 
I'm sure he has either John bombs there

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:55.400 
I'm sure he has either John bombs there
or<00:05:52.230> Tesla's<00:05:52.790> so<00:05:53.790> the<00:05:54.660> goal<00:05:54.840> here<00:05:54.870> is<00:05:55.200> not<00:05:55.230> to

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:55.410 
or Tesla's so the goal here is not to

00:05:55.410 --> 00:06:00.230 
or Tesla's so the goal here is not to
overkill<00:05:56.310> on<00:05:56.550> the<00:05:57.060> setting<00:05:57.540> of<00:05:57.690> troops<00:05:59.240> all
