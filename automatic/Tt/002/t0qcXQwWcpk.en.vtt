before<00:01:40.420> now<00:01:41.139> obviously<00:01:41.619> this<00:01:41.829> huge<00:01:42.100> map<00:01:42.310> would

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:42.520 
before now obviously this huge map would

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.190 
before now obviously this huge map would
only<00:01:42.700> be<00:01:42.880> able<00:01:42.999> to<00:01:43.240> be<00:01:43.359> handled<00:01:43.600> on<00:01:44.020> the

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:44.200 
only be able to be handled on the

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.230 
only be able to be handled on the
next-generation<00:01:44.530> consoles<00:01:45.310> Xbox<00:01:45.789> one<00:01:46.030> and

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:46.240 
next-generation consoles Xbox one and

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:48.629 
next-generation consoles Xbox one and
PlayStation<00:01:46.359> 4<00:01:46.770> another<00:01:47.770> reason<00:01:48.100> I<00:01:48.159> do<00:01:48.219> think

00:01:48.629 --> 00:01:48.639 
PlayStation 4 another reason I do think

00:01:48.639 --> 00:01:50.279 
PlayStation 4 another reason I do think
that<00:01:48.789> is<00:01:48.939> that<00:01:49.149> Call<00:01:49.359> of<00:01:49.389> Duty<00:01:49.719> games<00:01:49.959> come<00:01:50.200> out

00:01:50.279 --> 00:01:50.289 
that is that Call of Duty games come out

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:51.809 
that is that Call of Duty games come out
with<00:01:50.439> a<00:01:50.469> brand<00:01:50.770> new<00:01:50.859> series<00:01:51.100> every<00:01:51.520> single

00:01:51.809 --> 00:01:51.819 
with a brand new series every single

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:53.760 
with a brand new series every single
year<00:01:51.999> but<00:01:52.389> GT<00:01:52.689> is<00:01:52.810> much<00:01:53.049> different<00:01:53.499> they<00:01:53.590> come

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:53.770 
year but GT is much different they come

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:55.379 
year but GT is much different they come
out<00:01:53.799> with<00:01:54.009> a<00:01:54.069> brand<00:01:54.340> new<00:01:54.399> game<00:01:54.670> every<00:01:54.999> couple

00:01:55.379 --> 00:01:55.389 
out with a brand new game every couple

00:01:55.389 --> 00:01:57.120 
out with a brand new game every couple
of<00:01:55.479> years<00:01:55.719> because<00:01:55.840> the<00:01:56.049> development<00:01:56.469> takes<00:01:56.979> a

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 
of years because the development takes a

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:57.899 
of years because the development takes a
really<00:01:57.340> long<00:01:57.459> time

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:57.909 
really long time

00:01:57.909 --> 00:01:59.910 
really long time
now<00:01:58.450> with<00:01:58.569> GT<00:01:59.049> games<00:01:59.350> come<00:01:59.590> out<00:01:59.679> usually

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 
now with GT games come out usually

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.980 
now with GT games come out usually
within<00:02:00.340> four<00:02:00.670> to<00:02:00.700> six<00:02:01.060> years<00:02:01.389> I'm<00:02:01.600> not<00:02:01.749> really

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 
within four to six years I'm not really

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:03.389 
within four to six years I'm not really

PlayStation 4 so I don't really see um
games<00:02:10.000> being<00:02:10.420> made<00:02:10.629> on<00:02:10.840> the<00:02:10.869> agenda<00:02:11.470> now<00:02:12.189> I

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
sure but that's when we're actually

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.089 
sure but that's when we're actually
gonna<00:02:18.630> get<00:02:18.750> more<00:02:19.080> information<00:02:19.319> on<00:02:19.770> it<00:02:19.950> when

00:02:20.089 --> 00:02:20.099 
gonna get more information on it when

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:22.040 
gonna get more information on it when
they're<00:02:20.220> actually<00:02:20.489> working<00:02:20.670> on<00:02:21.000> it<00:02:21.209> Ben<00:02:21.870> Z

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.050 
they're actually working on it Ben Z

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:23.870 
they're actually working on it Ben Z
said<00:02:22.349> it's<00:02:22.500> always<00:02:22.739> a<00:02:22.770> possibility<00:02:23.310> that<00:02:23.640> vice

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:23.880 
said it's always a possibility that vice

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:25.520 
said it's always a possibility that vice
city<00:02:24.150> could<00:02:24.360> be<00:02:24.390> returning<00:02:24.840> as<00:02:25.080> a<00:02:25.110> future

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
city could be returning as a future

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:27.890 
city could be returning as a future
setting<00:02:26.010> but<00:02:26.520> he<00:02:26.700> said<00:02:26.970> that<00:02:27.120> vice<00:02:27.420> city<00:02:27.720> the

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:27.900 
setting but he said that vice city the

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.930 
setting but he said that vice city the
game<00:02:28.140> was<00:02:28.530> more<00:02:28.739> about<00:02:29.010> its<00:02:29.220> era<00:02:29.520> than<00:02:29.790> the

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940 
game was more about its era than the

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.690 
game was more about its era than the
setting<00:02:30.270> itself<00:02:30.500> Miami<00:02:31.500> in<00:02:31.590> the<00:02:31.620> 1980s<00:02:32.520> would

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
setting itself Miami in the 1980s would

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.640 
setting itself Miami in the 1980s would
be<00:02:32.850> so<00:02:33.060> ironic<00:02:33.600> and<00:02:33.720> strange<00:02:34.050> feeling<00:02:34.500> to

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:34.650 
be so ironic and strange feeling to

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:36.350 
be so ironic and strange feeling to
revisit<00:02:35.280> the<00:02:35.370> city<00:02:35.610> in<00:02:35.700> a<00:02:35.790> different<00:02:36.150> time

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
revisit the city in a different time

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.780 
revisit the city in a different time
period<00:02:36.739> another<00:02:37.739> thing<00:02:38.010> they<00:02:38.160> did<00:02:38.370> say<00:02:38.610> is

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:38.790 
period another thing they did say is

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.340 
period another thing they did say is
that<00:02:38.940> the<00:02:39.030> setting<00:02:39.390> would<00:02:39.540> not<00:02:39.750> be<00:02:39.930> London

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:40.350 
that the setting would not be London

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:42.110 
that the setting would not be London
however<00:02:40.709> they<00:02:40.920> would<00:02:41.100> love<00:02:41.430> to<00:02:41.610> make<00:02:41.790> the<00:02:41.940> game

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
however they would love to make the game

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.570 
however they would love to make the game
set<00:02:42.420> in<00:02:42.450> the<00:02:42.569> UK<00:02:43.019> set<00:02:43.380> in<00:02:43.470> London<00:02:43.680> but<00:02:44.459> they

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:44.580 
set in the UK set in London but they

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:46.370 
set in the UK set in London but they
don't<00:02:44.760> know<00:02:44.940> if<00:02:45.180> the<00:02:45.330> game<00:02:45.480> would<00:02:45.720> be<00:02:45.870> a<00:02:45.900> GTA

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
don't know if the game would be a GTA

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.590 
don't know if the game would be a GTA
game<00:02:46.470> in<00:02:46.890> London<00:02:47.100> he<00:02:47.730> thinks<00:02:47.970> there<00:02:48.090> plenty<00:02:48.390> of

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
game in London he thinks there plenty of

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.360 
game in London he thinks there plenty of
great<00:02:49.019> stories<00:02:49.380> they<00:02:49.500> could<00:02:49.560> tell<00:02:49.680> in<00:02:49.920> the<00:02:50.010> UK

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:50.370 
great stories they could tell in the UK

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:52.370 
great stories they could tell in the UK
great<00:02:50.880> environments<00:02:51.450> to<00:02:51.540> showcase<00:02:52.019> great

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380 
great environments to showcase great

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.020 
great environments to showcase great
gameplay<00:02:52.799> mechanics<00:02:53.280> that<00:02:53.400> the<00:02:53.519> UK<00:02:53.819> could

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:54.030 
gameplay mechanics that the UK could

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:56.059 
gameplay mechanics that the UK could
bend<00:02:54.239> to<00:02:54.450> them<00:02:54.660> I<00:02:54.870> just<00:02:55.350> don't<00:02:55.620> think<00:02:55.890> it<00:02:56.040> would

00:02:56.059 --> 00:02:56.069 
bend to them I just don't think it would

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:59.150 
bend to them I just don't think it would
be<00:02:56.160> unnecessarily<00:02:57.120> GTA<00:02:57.720> game<00:02:58.110> so<00:02:59.040> they're

00:02:59.150 --> 00:02:59.160 
be unnecessarily GTA game so they're

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.680 
be unnecessarily GTA game so they're
kind<00:02:59.370> of<00:02:59.459> doubting<00:02:59.850> that<00:03:00.000> the<00:03:00.090> setting<00:03:00.420> for<00:03:00.630> a

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:00.690 
kind of doubting that the setting for a

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:02.660 
kind of doubting that the setting for a
GTA<00:03:01.019> game<00:03:01.110> could<00:03:01.500> be<00:03:01.650> in<00:03:01.739> the<00:03:01.830> UK<00:03:02.130> I<00:03:02.160> honestly

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670 
GTA game could be in the UK I honestly

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:03.920 
GTA game could be in the UK I honestly
wouldn't<00:03:02.910> mind<00:03:03.180> I<00:03:03.330> think<00:03:03.390> would<00:03:03.660> be<00:03:03.780> something

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
wouldn't mind I think would be something

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:04.910 
wouldn't mind I think would be something
new<00:03:04.260> and<00:03:04.290> awesome

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
new and awesome

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:06.860 
new and awesome
but<00:03:05.160> he<00:03:05.280> did<00:03:05.459> say<00:03:05.670> that<00:03:05.700> a<00:03:05.910> setting<00:03:06.330> in<00:03:06.480> London

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
but he did say that a setting in London

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.110 
but he did say that a setting in London
for<00:03:07.080> the<00:03:07.110> UK<00:03:07.530> could<00:03:07.860> be<00:03:08.010> left<00:03:08.340> to<00:03:08.489> another<00:03:08.580> game

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:16.170 
this is what he said in the future could

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:17.390 
this is what he said in the future could
we<00:03:16.319> do<00:03:16.440> a<00:03:16.470> game<00:03:16.739> with<00:03:16.920> the<00:03:17.010> lead<00:03:17.190> female

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.400 
we do a game with the lead female

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.370 
we do a game with the lead female
character<00:03:17.549> of<00:03:18.150> course<00:03:18.420> we<00:03:18.989> just<00:03:19.019> haven't

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
character of course we just haven't

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:20.990 
character of course we just haven't
found<00:03:19.620> the<00:03:19.769> right<00:03:19.799> game<00:03:20.190> for<00:03:20.489> it<00:03:20.609> yet

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:21.000 
found the right game for it yet

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.340 
found the right game for it yet
but<00:03:21.209> it's<00:03:21.329> one<00:03:21.570> of<00:03:21.660> the<00:03:21.750> things<00:03:21.959> I<00:03:22.200> would

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.350 
but it's one of the things I would

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:24.110 
but it's one of the things I would
always<00:03:22.560> think<00:03:22.709> about<00:03:23.190> it<00:03:23.700> doesn't<00:03:24.000> feel

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120 
always think about it doesn't feel

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.940 
always think about it doesn't feel
natural<00:03:24.359> for<00:03:24.750> this<00:03:24.870> game<00:03:25.109> but<00:03:25.350> definitely<00:03:25.799> for

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950 
natural for this game but definitely for

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:27.740 
natural for this game but definitely for
the<00:03:26.070> right<00:03:26.280> game<00:03:26.519> in<00:03:26.730> the<00:03:26.820> future<00:03:27.000> with<00:03:27.600> the

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
the right game in the future with the

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.630 
the right game in the future with the
right<00:03:27.930> themes<00:03:28.230> it<00:03:28.530> could<00:03:28.650> be<00:03:28.769> fantastic<00:03:28.950> for

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:29.640 
right themes it could be fantastic for

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:32.210 
right themes it could be fantastic for
GT<00:03:30.239> 5<00:03:30.570> this<00:03:30.810> was<00:03:30.989> an<00:03:31.109> organic<00:03:31.440> thing<00:03:31.650> that<00:03:32.040> came

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
GT 5 this was an organic thing that came

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:33.650 
GT 5 this was an organic thing that came
up<00:03:32.250> these<00:03:32.790> are<00:03:33.030> the<00:03:33.060> characters<00:03:33.510> I<00:03:33.630> would

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:33.660 
up these are the characters I would

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:35.300 
up these are the characters I would
display<00:03:34.079> themes<00:03:34.410> we<00:03:34.620> wanted<00:03:34.950> to<00:03:35.040> talk<00:03:35.280> about
