00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
have to pull back right there so just to

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.759 
have to pull back right there so just to
look<00:02:26.700> five<00:02:27.120> bottles<00:02:27.570> of<00:02:27.720> champagne<00:02:28.200> in<00:02:28.530> the

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:28.769 
look five bottles of champagne in the

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:30.250 
look five bottles of champagne in the
but<00:02:28.950> in<00:02:29.100> the<00:02:29.310> bag

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:30.260 
but in the bag

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.170 
but in the bag
these<00:02:31.260> aren't<00:02:31.650> full-size<00:02:32.340> bottles<00:02:33.000> a<00:02:33.150> couple

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180 
these aren't full-size bottles a couple

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.300 
these aren't full-size bottles a couple
of<00:02:33.570> them<00:02:33.690> so<00:02:33.930> I<00:02:34.380> was<00:02:34.590> able<00:02:34.829> to<00:02:34.859> get<00:02:34.980> all<00:02:35.130> five

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
of them so I was able to get all five

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.280 
of them so I was able to get all five
standing<00:02:36.090> straight<00:02:36.359> up<00:02:36.390> I<00:02:36.720> suppose<00:02:36.900> they<00:02:37.170> had

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:37.290 
standing straight up I suppose they had

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:39.830 
standing straight up I suppose they had
larger<00:02:37.650> bottles<00:02:38.010> in<00:02:38.220> France<00:02:38.790> at<00:02:39.030> the<00:02:39.060> time<00:02:39.180> so

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
larger bottles in France at the time so

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.690 
larger bottles in France at the time so
maybe<00:02:40.709> that's<00:02:40.890> why<00:02:41.010> they<00:02:41.100> had<00:02:41.220> a<00:02:41.250> turn<00:02:41.489> one

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
maybe that's why they had a turn one

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:46.130 
maybe that's why they had a turn one
upside<00:02:42.000> down<00:02:42.269> maybe<00:02:42.989> they<00:02:43.170> were<00:02:43.230> magnums<00:02:45.140> for

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:46.140 
upside down maybe they were magnums for

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:47.449 
upside down maybe they were magnums for
those<00:02:46.260> of<00:02:46.440> us<00:02:46.560> who<00:02:46.680> don't<00:02:46.890> carry<00:02:47.280> our

00:02:47.449 --> 00:02:47.459 
those of us who don't carry our

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:49.400 
those of us who don't carry our

I think is one of those bags that you

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:08.900 
I think is one of those bags that you
have<00:05:06.450> to<00:05:06.570> see<00:05:06.750> in<00:05:06.900> person<00:05:07.230> on<00:05:07.770> the<00:05:08.040> website<00:05:08.610> the

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:08.910 
have to see in person on the website the

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:11.500 
have to see in person on the website the
picture<00:05:09.360> just<00:05:09.630> does<00:05:09.870> not<00:05:10.080> do<00:05:10.440> it<00:05:10.590> justice

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:11.510 
picture just does not do it justice

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:14.060 
picture just does not do it justice
because<00:05:12.510> I<00:05:12.660> had<00:05:13.050> seen<00:05:13.290> the<00:05:13.500> new<00:05:13.620> way<00:05:13.770> many

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:14.070 
because I had seen the new way many

00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:14.930 
because I had seen the new way many
times<00:05:14.370> on

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:14.940 
times on

00:05:14.940 --> 00:05:17.570 
times on
website<00:05:15.300> never<00:05:15.660> thought<00:05:16.110> twice<00:05:16.350> about<00:05:16.500> it<00:05:16.860> one

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:17.580 
website never thought twice about it one

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:19.220 
website never thought twice about it one
day<00:05:17.610> I<00:05:17.760> was<00:05:17.940> in<00:05:18.030> the<00:05:18.120> store<00:05:18.420> and<00:05:18.690> I<00:05:18.810> happen<00:05:19.200> to

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:19.230 
day I was in the store and I happen to

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:21.860 
day I was in the store and I happen to
pass<00:05:19.440> by<00:05:19.500> it<00:05:19.830> and<00:05:20.100> the<00:05:20.790> display<00:05:21.390> the<00:05:21.570> reason<00:05:21.810> I

00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:21.870 
pass by it and the display the reason I

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:23.750 
pass by it and the display the reason I
noticed<00:05:22.230> it<00:05:22.380> was<00:05:22.500> because<00:05:22.890> it<00:05:23.220> was<00:05:23.460> kind<00:05:23.700> of

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:23.760 
noticed it was because it was kind of

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:25.670 
noticed it was because it was kind of
opened<00:05:24.150> up<00:05:24.270> like<00:05:24.450> this<00:05:24.660> and<00:05:24.900> more<00:05:25.110> relaxed

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:25.680 
opened up like this and more relaxed

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:26.570 
opened up like this and more relaxed
which<00:05:25.830> gives<00:05:26.070> it<00:05:26.190> a<00:05:26.250> whole<00:05:26.430> different

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:26.580 
which gives it a whole different

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:29.120 
which gives it a whole different
appearance<00:05:27.240> so<00:05:27.870> I<00:05:27.900> stopped<00:05:28.350> and<00:05:28.530> asked<00:05:28.830> what

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:29.130 
appearance so I stopped and asked what

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:31.880 
appearance so I stopped and asked what
bag<00:05:29.370> that<00:05:29.610> was<00:05:29.850> it<00:05:30.180> was<00:05:30.360> the<00:05:30.540> new<00:05:30.720> way<00:05:30.870> which<00:05:31.590> as

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:31.890 
bag that was it was the new way which as

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:33.110 
bag that was it was the new way which as
I<00:05:32.070> said<00:05:32.130> I<00:05:32.310> never<00:05:32.460> would<00:05:32.760> have<00:05:32.790> thought<00:05:33.060> that

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:33.120 
I said I never would have thought that

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:35.390 
I said I never would have thought that
having<00:05:33.630> judged<00:05:34.170> by<00:05:34.440> the<00:05:34.830> picture<00:05:35.100> they<00:05:35.220> have

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:35.400
