you'll<00:01:43.829> also<00:01:44.070> see<00:01:44.430> that<00:01:44.460> they've<00:01:44.880> set<00:01:45.210> your

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
you'll also see that they've set your

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.120 
you'll also see that they've set your
sapphire<00:01:45.780> handsaw<00:01:46.350> here<00:01:46.500> took<00:01:46.649> a<00:01:46.710> little<00:01:46.890> bit

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.130 
sapphire handsaw here took a little bit

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:49.420 
sapphire handsaw here took a little bit
damage<00:01:47.520> it<00:01:47.880> does<00:01:48.090> take<00:01:48.329> durability<00:01:48.869> damage

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:49.430 
damage it does take durability damage

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.670 
damage it does take durability damage
next<00:01:50.430> if<00:01:50.729> you<00:01:50.820> place<00:01:51.060> your<00:01:51.270> dirt<00:01:51.540> slabs<00:01:51.930> with

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
next if you place your dirt slabs with

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:55.130 
next if you place your dirt slabs with
this<00:01:52.979> handsaw<00:01:53.579> above<00:01:53.880> it<00:01:54.030> you<00:01:54.750> get<00:01:54.930> dirt

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
this handsaw above it you get dirt

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.190 
this handsaw above it you get dirt
panels<00:01:55.590> they're<00:01:56.070> slightly<00:01:56.369> thinner

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
panels they're slightly thinner

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.520 
panels they're slightly thinner
I'll<00:01:58.200> even<00:01:58.380> just<00:01:58.619> do<00:01:58.740> one<00:01:58.979> for<00:01:59.159> now

00:01:59.520 --> 00:01:59.530 
I'll even just do one for now

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.580 
I'll even just do one for now
if<00:02:00.280> you<00:02:00.520> place<00:02:00.820> your<00:02:00.850> hand<00:02:01.390> saw<00:02:01.930> to<00:02:02.200> the<00:02:02.320> left

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:02.590 
if you place your hand saw to the left

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:04.770 
if you place your hand saw to the left
of<00:02:02.770> your<00:02:02.860> dirt<00:02:03.070> slab<00:02:03.370> you<00:02:04.030> get<00:02:04.210> a<00:02:04.240> dirt<00:02:04.480> slab

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:04.780 
of your dirt slab you get a dirt slab

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.630 
of your dirt slab you get a dirt slab
strip<00:02:05.170> so<00:02:05.680> now<00:02:05.830> that<00:02:05.890> it's<00:02:06.130> in<00:02:06.250> a<00:02:06.370> slightly

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
strip so now that it's in a slightly

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.180 
strip so now that it's in a slightly
smaller<00:02:07.240> size<00:02:07.810> you<00:02:08.229> can<00:02:08.560> either<00:02:08.710> cut<00:02:08.950> it<00:02:09.070> from

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
smaller size you can either cut it from

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.120 
smaller size you can either cut it from
the<00:02:09.310> side<00:02:09.520> or<00:02:09.550> the<00:02:09.970> top<00:02:10.410> other<00:02:11.410> sides<00:02:11.800> don't

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
the side or the top other sides don't

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:13.830 
the side or the top other sides don't
work<00:02:12.310> well<00:02:12.790> left<00:02:13.120> or<00:02:13.270> right<00:02:13.390> is<00:02:13.540> about<00:02:13.630> the

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:13.840 
work well left or right is about the

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.610 
work well left or right is about the
same<00:02:14.050> but<00:02:14.650> the<00:02:15.130> top<00:02:15.340> does<00:02:15.610> that<00:02:16.140> so<00:02:17.140> you<00:02:17.200> could

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620 
same but the top does that so you could

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:21.360 
same but the top does that so you could
get<00:02:17.770> your<00:02:17.830> dirt<00:02:18.190> panel<00:02:18.610> from<00:02:18.850> the<00:02:18.880> top<00:02:20.190> or<00:02:21.190> if

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
get your dirt panel from the top or if

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:22.920 
get your dirt panel from the top or if
you<00:02:21.459> put<00:02:21.580> it<00:02:21.730> on<00:02:21.820> the<00:02:21.910> side<00:02:22.120> you<00:02:22.600> can<00:02:22.720> get<00:02:22.870> a

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
you put it on the side you can get a

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:28.140 
you put it on the side you can get a
dirt<00:02:23.140> slab<00:02:23.470> stripped<00:02:26.520> if<00:02:27.520> we<00:02:27.610> take<00:02:27.820> our<00:02:27.940> dirt

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:28.150 
dirt slab stripped if we take our dirt

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.810 
dirt slab stripped if we take our dirt
panel<00:02:28.540> now<00:02:28.690> we<00:02:29.590> can<00:02:29.770> either<00:02:29.890> get<00:02:30.100> a<00:02:30.160> dirt<00:02:30.400> panel

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:30.820 
panel now we can either get a dirt panel

00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:39.270 
panel now we can either get a dirt panel
slit<00:02:34.050> or<00:02:35.050> we<00:02:35.290> can<00:02:35.410> get<00:02:35.500> a<00:02:35.560> dirt<00:02:35.800> cover<00:02:38.070> and<00:02:39.070> dirt

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
slit or we can get a dirt cover and dirt

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:40.860 
slit or we can get a dirt cover and dirt
cover<00:02:39.610> is<00:02:39.820> gonna<00:02:39.940> be<00:02:40.180> the<00:02:40.330> thinnest<00:02:40.690> that<00:02:40.810> you

other items so we can place these guys
down<00:03:27.040> and<00:03:27.400> what's<00:03:27.549> nice<00:03:27.730> is<00:03:28.000> you<00:03:28.030> can<00:03:28.239> kind<00:03:28.360> of

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
down and what's nice is you can kind of

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.180 
down and what's nice is you can kind of
see<00:03:28.720> how<00:03:28.989> they'll<00:03:29.200> look<00:03:29.350> in<00:03:29.530> the<00:03:29.620> world<00:03:29.799> as<00:03:30.040> you

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
see how they'll look in the world as you

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:39.840 
see how they'll look in the world as you
place<00:03:30.400> them<00:03:30.700> before<00:03:31.239> you<00:03:31.329> do

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:39.850 

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:41.730 

you<00:03:40.450> can<00:03:40.600> see<00:03:40.780> that<00:03:40.930> some<00:03:41.110> items<00:03:41.230> need<00:03:41.560> to<00:03:41.650> be

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:41.740 
you can see that some items need to be

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:43.410 
you can see that some items need to be
placed<00:03:42.040> on<00:03:42.280> things<00:03:42.640> where<00:03:42.850> other<00:03:42.970> items<00:03:43.330> can

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:43.420 
placed on things where other items can

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.960 
placed on things where other items can
stand<00:03:43.780> on<00:03:43.930> their<00:03:44.080> own<00:03:44.130> so<00:03:45.130> your<00:03:45.400> pillars<00:03:45.730> can

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:45.970 
stand on their own so your pillars can

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:49.260 
stand on their own so your pillars can
stand<00:03:46.270> up<00:03:46.420> on<00:03:46.570> their<00:03:46.690> own<00:03:46.750> like<00:03:47.050> that<00:03:47.290> but<00:03:48.270> the

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:49.270 
stand up on their own like that but the

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:52.350 
stand up on their own like that but the
ones<00:03:49.450> that<00:03:49.630> don't<00:03:49.840> have<00:03:49.990> that<00:03:50.020> base<00:03:50.380> cannot<00:03:51.360> so

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:52.360 
ones that don't have that base cannot so

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.060 
ones that don't have that base cannot so
just<00:03:52.630> so<00:03:52.720> you<00:03:52.810> can<00:03:52.960> see<00:03:53.140> that<00:03:53.260> again<00:03:53.590> while<00:03:54.040> I

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:54.070 
just so you can see that again while I

00:03:54.070 --> 00:04:06.320 
just so you can see that again while I
cut<00:03:54.400> up<00:03:54.430> some<00:03:54.700> cobblestone

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:06.330 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:10.010 

cobblestone<00:04:07.290> pillars<00:04:08.360> can<00:04:09.360> stand<00:04:09.720> on<00:04:09.870> their

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:10.020 
cobblestone pillars can stand on their

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:17.150 
cobblestone pillars can stand on their

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:27.790 

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:30.960 

you<00:04:28.360> can<00:04:28.540> also<00:04:28.720> place<00:04:29.110> your<00:04:29.500> slabs<00:04:29.920> panels<00:04:30.730> and

up on their own or be placed up against
another<00:04:37.000> item

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:44.700 

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:47.800 

pretty<00:04:45.390> cool

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:47.810 

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:49.720 

now<00:04:48.380> the<00:04:48.440> nice<00:04:48.680> thing<00:04:48.950> about<00:04:48.980> covers

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:49.730 
now the nice thing about covers

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:52.920 
now the nice thing about covers
specifically<00:04:50.510> the<00:04:51.290> extra<00:04:51.860> thin<00:04:52.040> ones<00:04:52.280> that<00:04:52.580> is

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:52.930 
specifically the extra thin ones that is

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:58.210 
specifically the extra thin ones that is
so<00:04:53.930> let's<00:04:54.080> take<00:04:54.290> our<00:04:54.440> covers<00:04:56.740> and<00:04:57.740> go<00:04:57.950> play

so let's take our covers and go play
with<00:04:58.250> the<00:04:58.460> redstone<00:04:58.880> contraption<00:04:59.450> I<00:04:59.540> made<00:04:59.720> in

00:04:59.830 --> 00:04:59.840 
with the redstone contraption I made in

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:01.150 
with the redstone contraption I made in
one<00:04:59.870> of<00:04:59.990> my<00:05:00.110> previous<00:05:00.320> videos

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:01.160 
one of my previous videos

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:06.700 
one of my previous videos
nice<00:05:02.150> looking<00:05:02.510> wall<00:05:05.200> and<00:05:06.200> we<00:05:06.320> wanted<00:05:06.530> to<00:05:06.590> run

00:05:06.700 --> 00:05:06.710 
nice looking wall and we wanted to run

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:09.970 
nice looking wall and we wanted to run
our<00:05:06.860> redstone<00:05:07.070> wire<00:05:07.520> down<00:05:07.850> that<00:05:08.120> wall<00:05:08.860> but<00:05:09.860> we

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:09.980 
our redstone wire down that wall but we

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:11.650 
our redstone wire down that wall but we
didn't<00:05:10.190> want<00:05:10.340> this<00:05:10.460> ugly<00:05:10.820> wire<00:05:11.030> hanging<00:05:11.570> out

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:11.660 
didn't want this ugly wire hanging out

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:13.750 
didn't want this ugly wire hanging out
in<00:05:11.780> the<00:05:11.840> middle<00:05:12.050> of<00:05:12.139> our<00:05:12.200> house<00:05:12.440> we<00:05:13.400> can<00:05:13.580> use

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:13.760 
in the middle of our house we can use

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:16.870 
in the middle of our house we can use
our<00:05:13.940> stone<00:05:14.180> covers<00:05:15.340> and<00:05:16.340> make<00:05:16.550> sure<00:05:16.700> they're

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:16.880 
our stone covers and make sure they're

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:23.430 
our stone covers and make sure they're
oriented<00:05:17.360> properly

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:23.440 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:25.440 

and<00:05:23.920> they<00:05:24.100> actually<00:05:24.280> completely<00:05:25.090> cover<00:05:25.300> up

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:25.450 
and they actually completely cover up

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:27.240 
and they actually completely cover up
your<00:05:25.600> redstone<00:05:25.990> wire<00:05:26.230> you<00:05:26.680> can't<00:05:26.920> even<00:05:27.070> tell

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:27.250 
your redstone wire you can't even tell

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:28.920 
your redstone wire you can't even tell
the<00:05:27.310> difference<00:05:27.400> between<00:05:27.910> the<00:05:28.360> stone<00:05:28.600> cover

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:28.930 
the difference between the stone cover

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:31.440 
the difference between the stone cover
and<00:05:29.410> the<00:05:29.500> regular<00:05:29.860> cobblestone<00:05:30.400> and<00:05:30.670> you<00:05:31.300> can

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:31.450 
and the regular cobblestone and you can

00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:33.120 
and the regular cobblestone and you can
do<00:05:31.510> the<00:05:31.600> same<00:05:31.780> with<00:05:31.960> smooth<00:05:32.230> stone<00:05:32.560> almost

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:33.130 
do the same with smooth stone almost

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:35.130 
do the same with smooth stone almost
every<00:05:33.700> block<00:05:33.910> in<00:05:34.090> the<00:05:34.180> game<00:05:34.390> can<00:05:34.690> be<00:05:34.720> cut<00:05:34.960> in

00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:35.140 
every block in the game can be cut in

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:37.680 
every block in the game can be cut in
this<00:05:35.290> manner<00:05:35.530> this<00:05:36.520> also<00:05:36.760> works<00:05:37.090> with<00:05:37.300> smooth

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:37.690 
this manner this also works with smooth

00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:42.860 
this manner this also works with smooth
stone<00:05:37.990> it<00:05:38.680> works<00:05:38.950> with<00:05:39.720> it<00:05:40.720> works<00:05:40.930> with<00:05:41.140> wool

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:42.870 
stone it works with it works with wool

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:48.350 
stone it works with it works with wool
it<00:05:43.870> works<00:05:44.200> with<00:05:44.440> pumpkins

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:48.360 

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:51.800 

and<00:05:48.840> it<00:05:49.110> works<00:05:49.289> with<00:05:49.409> blocks<00:05:49.710> of<00:05:49.889> iron<00:05:50.810> so

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:51.810 
and it works with blocks of iron so

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:54.080 
and it works with blocks of iron so
pretty<00:05:52.050> much<00:05:52.229> a<00:05:52.500> majority<00:05:53.250> of<00:05:53.460> the<00:05:53.580> blocks<00:05:53.849> in

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:54.090 
pretty much a majority of the blocks in

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:55.909 
pretty much a majority of the blocks in
the<00:05:54.120> game<00:05:54.210> can<00:05:54.720> be<00:05:54.750> cut<00:05:55.050> in<00:05:55.169> this<00:05:55.259> manner<00:05:55.530> I'm

00:05:55.909 --> 00:05:55.919 
the game can be cut in this manner I'm

00:05:55.919 --> 00:05:58.939 
the game can be cut in this manner I'm
sitting<00:05:56.310> -<00:05:56.490> not<00:05:57.110> it<00:05:58.110> works<00:05:58.319> with<00:05:58.500> bookshelves

00:05:58.939 --> 00:05:58.949 
sitting - not it works with bookshelves

00:05:58.949 --> 00:06:02.869 
sitting - not it works with bookshelves
so<00:06:00.770> you<00:06:01.770> can<00:06:01.919> kind<00:06:02.129> of<00:06:02.219> play<00:06:02.400> around<00:06:02.550> and

00:06:02.869 --> 00:06:02.879 
so you can kind of play around and

00:06:02.879 --> 00:06:04.459 
so you can kind of play around and
figure<00:06:03.030> out<00:06:03.300> what<00:06:03.539> works<00:06:03.780> for<00:06:03.900> you<00:06:04.080> and<00:06:04.169> what

00:06:04.459 --> 00:06:04.469 
figure out what works for you and what

00:06:04.469 --> 00:06:06.439 
figure out what works for you and what
does<00:06:04.650> not<00:06:04.889> you<00:06:05.550> can<00:06:05.729> see<00:06:05.939> some<00:06:06.180> of<00:06:06.210> the<00:06:06.330> items

00:06:06.439 --> 00:06:06.449 
does not you can see some of the items

00:06:06.449 --> 00:06:08.149 
does not you can see some of the items
here<00:06:06.870> but<00:06:07.020> I<00:06:07.439> don't<00:06:07.500> think<00:06:07.800> that's<00:06:07.949> all<00:06:08.129> of

00:06:08.149 --> 00:06:08.159 
here but I don't think that's all of

00:06:08.159 --> 00:06:09.860 
here but I don't think that's all of
them<00:06:08.340> I<00:06:08.430> think<00:06:08.460> there's<00:06:08.819> more<00:06:09.030> to<00:06:09.539> it<00:06:09.569> than

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:09.870 
them I think there's more to it than

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:15.050 
them I think there's more to it than
just<00:06:09.930> what's<00:06:10.379> shown<00:06:10.590> here<00:06:10.860> at<00:06:10.949> TMI<00:06:13.759> and<00:06:14.759> if<00:06:14.939> you

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:15.060 
just what's shown here at TMI and if you

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:16.879 
just what's shown here at TMI and if you
really<00:06:15.240> wanted<00:06:15.569> to<00:06:15.659> get<00:06:15.780> creative<00:06:16.080> you<00:06:16.500> could

00:06:16.879 --> 00:06:16.889 
really wanted to get creative you could

00:06:16.889 --> 00:06:24.110 
really wanted to get creative you could
place<00:06:17.129> down<00:06:17.370> your<00:06:17.400> pillars<00:06:19.550> like<00:06:20.550> so<00:06:23.030> if<00:06:24.030> you

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:24.120 
place down your pillars like so if you

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:30.469 
place down your pillars like so if you
had<00:06:24.389> some<00:06:24.740> slabs<00:06:25.740> here<00:06:28.879> you<00:06:29.879> could<00:06:30.030> use<00:06:30.210> them

00:06:30.469 --> 00:06:30.479 
had some slabs here you could use them

00:06:30.479 --> 00:06:35.770 
had some slabs here you could use them
to<00:06:30.509> create<00:06:31.020> a<00:06:31.289> table

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:35.780 

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:37.540 

of<00:06:36.080> course<00:06:36.350> it<00:06:36.530> takes<00:06:36.710> a<00:06:36.920> little<00:06:37.070> bit<00:06:37.250> of<00:06:37.310> time

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:37.550 
of course it takes a little bit of time

00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:43.279 
of course it takes a little bit of time
and<00:06:37.820> get<00:06:37.910> everything<00:06:38.210> right<00:06:38.560> there<00:06:39.560> we<00:06:39.680> go

00:06:43.279 --> 00:06:43.289 

00:06:43.289 --> 00:06:44.989 

just<00:06:43.919> make<00:06:44.069> sure<00:06:44.099> you're<00:06:44.369> not<00:06:44.460> standing<00:06:44.789> in

00:06:44.989 --> 00:06:44.999 
just make sure you're not standing in

00:06:44.999 --> 00:06:48.049 
just make sure you're not standing in
the<00:06:45.059> way<00:06:45.770> then<00:06:46.770> I<00:06:46.919> get<00:06:47.069> myself<00:06:47.249> a<00:06:47.550> couple<00:06:47.789> more

00:06:48.049 --> 00:06:48.059 
the way then I get myself a couple more

00:06:48.059 --> 00:06:57.610 
the way then I get myself a couple more
