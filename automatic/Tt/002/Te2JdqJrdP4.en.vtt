00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 Hello, this issue is dedicated 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.120
 masters who are just starting 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:07.740
 build and design nails 

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.780
 This video will be useful to those asty 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.710
 who have just learned finished 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.200
 some schools 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.179
 but they still have some questions and 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.060
 Today I will build up with you 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.710
 imagine the lonely goal of uncovering some 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.050
 secrets are such harmful masters 

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.720
 who don't want to share with newbies 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.820
 my experience is absolutely free 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.410
 I share with you the secrets of the most 

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:30.179
 the main thing is to come back to 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.160
 this material and periodically it 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:34.559
 view and repeat these steps 

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.540
 you have seen today before 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.730
 start building up let's deal with 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.860
 architecture and artificial structure 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.750
 the nail 

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:46.590
 if you look at the top of our artificial 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:50.039
 nail should look like it has 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:53.719
 parallel sides here you will be zone 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:57.059
 cuticle conditionally here free edge 

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:58.980
 means that it is important here as I said 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:03.350
 parallel sides must be strictly 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:09.530
 elder parallel to each other 

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:09.530
 perpendicular to the sides 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:17.180
 so denote fell on the smile line if 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:19.850
 look at the side of our nail should 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:22.790
 look something like this 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:26.440
 the lower lateral line here and so finger 

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:28.760
 we will have a cuticle zone and 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.760
 artificial nail looks like 

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:36.100
 way 

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:40.160
 something like this is a classic square 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:43.160
 which we will build up today that 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:45.440
 important here are the side lines which 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:48.590
 here in parallel they are also parallel 

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:50.150
 and here one sideline comes out of 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.460
 the angle of the nail roller is 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:55.760
 the continuation of the nail and the second side 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:58.280
 the line on the back is also coming out 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:00.530
 near the nail roller is also 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.590
 continuation of the nails these two lines should 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.000
 be strictly parallel to each other 

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:07.070
 naturally by themselves parallel they 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.220
 they will not need to be modeled 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:15.580
 way about this we'll talk here need 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:15.580
 pay attention to the cuticle area 

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:21.410
 the material is very plan here it passes 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:25.220
 the material is about like this 

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:28.310
 so here, respectively, and he 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:31.370
 very smoothly enters the natural nail 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:33.680
 so that the border is not visible to consider 

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:38.900
 free edge when modeling 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:41.570
 I create it in such a way that the top 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:45.560
 longitudinal arch I call it 

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:48.470
 here it is here this line from about 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:52.340
 stress zone until the end of the free cut 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:57.320
 there was this line parallel to the bottom 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:58.100
 sidelines like this effect 

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.980
 to achieve 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:03.800
 I will definitely show you here 

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:05.660
 the material gradually fades to the next 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:08.000
 This formulation is typical error 

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:10.520
 do the master when the form set 

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:14.959
 as follows 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:20.350
 natural nail and masters 

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:20.350
 as always put a form of continuation 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:26.580
 nail plate like this 

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:29.940
 way here so here they substitute 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:33.020
 here at tani we glue them together 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:36.290
 rip here perforation leave 

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:42.150
 as follows form here it is 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:44.790
 put under the thumb of 

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:46.770
 continuing the nail plate with such 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:50.460
 Artificially shaped nail 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:56.610
 it turns out not very beautiful well, about 

00:03:50.460 --> 00:04:00.020
 there so so they lower the side 

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:03.000
 the line is free edge 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:11.490
 they want to create a stress zone here 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:14.850
 pile up a hill here they killed here 

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:19.770
 surely the sidelines they turn out 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:24.690
 not not included from the side roller and 

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:29.010
 spit higher well and no arches flat 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:31.500
 nails are absolutely not nails themselves 

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:32.900
 flax and absolutely start here here 

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:35.670
 exfoliate looks ugly 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:38.760
 cumbersome awful ie setting 

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:41.190
 Forum is fundamentally wrong no 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:44.250
 washed down here will not fix so rude 

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:45.710
 error back to our artificial 

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:48.720
 beautiful nail 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:52.320
 Imagine that here here we go 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:53.880
 nail forgot to say that u 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.540
 artificial nail must necessarily 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:57.180
 attend 

00:04:54.540 --> 00:05:01.380
 arch contest for modeling such an arch 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:04.140
 that's 50 percent of the range let's imagine that 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:09.230
 it's a 50 percent circle we will have 

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:09.230
 look something like this 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:18.410
 salons fringe implies a 

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:23.940
 archway 

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:26.690
 about 30-40 percent of the circle well here 

00:05:23.940 --> 00:05:33.030
 so draw 

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:35.520
 Arochka must necessarily be but on my 

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:36.510
 taste in my mind 50 percent for 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:39.960
 salon 

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:42.180
 french is too cool 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:44.250
 You can do a little softer to the point 

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:46.290
 so aggressive and since we have 

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:48.660
 there must be an arch accordingly we have it 

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:51.270
 here here we schedule here we have the top 

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:53.640
 point which will be ours 

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:55.590
 paper form here with us. 

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:56.760
 in which we will substitute this 

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:59.040
 paper form 

00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:04.230
 if you connect two points see what 

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:08.060
 get staged form goes 

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:08.060
 as follows here it is 

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:24.349
 to make it clear neatly in mind our 

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:28.810
 natural nail here it is well, and the form 

00:06:24.349 --> 00:06:28.810
 correspondingly inserted here 

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:45.520
 Well, here we have a knife by nature 

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:49.120
 the diagram clearly shows that if we 

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:52.770
 put the form a little higher it will give us 

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:56.860
 the ability to model a high arch and 

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:59.230
 straight sidelines stress zone 

00:06:56.860 --> 00:07:01.240
 here by itself you appear 

00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:04.450
 you can see that she is right here 

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:06.490
 there is a nail in this place reaches 

00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:09.250
 about three millimeters with that 

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:11.520
 the thickness of the free cut here will be one 

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:11.520
 millimeter
