00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:09.040
 at jeep the big cherokee represents 

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:11.350
 the upscale and is trying to go 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:13.150
 compete with the x5m she kayane other 

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:13.930
 range as he must therefore have a 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:16.180
 muscular version 

00:00:13.930 --> 00:00:17.650
 here it is called srt and cache 

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:20.650
 under his hood a gasoline v8 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:22.330
 atmospheric 6 liters 4 and 4 168 

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:23.590
 horses coupled to an automatic gearbox 

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:24.520
 at 8 reports and of course a 

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:26.289
 full transmission 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:27.369
 this version is certainly and is recognizable 

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:29.680
 among others to his front shield 

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:31.539
 work it's yes on the hood these 

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:32.769
 huge 20-inch black wheels where these 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:33.280
 two big exhaust outlets at 

00:00:32.769 --> 00:00:36.519
 the rear 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.749
 the decor is planted inside the 

00:00:36.519 --> 00:00:39.280
 bucket seats in the front his last 

00:00:37.749 --> 00:00:40.929
 leather and alcantara but lack of 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.670
 lateral support given the vocation of the 

00:00:40.929 --> 00:00:44.109
 car the wooden board represents 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.519
 correctly it is not at the level of 

00:00:44.109 --> 00:00:46.839
 more prestigious competitors be it 

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:48.729
 for materials for assembly 

00:00:46.839 --> 00:00:50.019
 of a circus carbon of our model 

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:52.389
 test remains despite everything 

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:53.679
 friendly in the back the space is 

00:00:52.389 --> 00:00:55.239
 identical to that of the other big ones 

00:00:53.679 --> 00:00:57.940
 cherokee three adults can sit 

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:59.409
 comfortably on the other hand with 457 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.249
 cubic decimetres the trunk is pale 

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:04.270
 figure compared to the competition 

00:01:02.249 --> 00:01:06.220
 contacted right away the v8 comes in 

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:07.510
 scene his sound did not remain unobtrusive at 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.430
 low load and low speeds and becomes 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:11.230
 explosive beyond 4000 rounds up 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.120
 the red zone located at 6500 tours 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:15.430
 the thrust is progressive and becomes 

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:17.470
 strong there also around 4000 laps 

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:19.840
 the machine despite its 2 tons 4 announced 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:20.590
 goes from 0 to 100 in 5 seconds better than 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:22.510
 many sportsmen 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.400
 chassis side this big suv fight 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:25.720
 effectively against the roll at the price 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.910
 a firm comfort and a lot of 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.110
 trepidation on bad coating the 

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:30.790
 rather direct direction gives a 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:32.590
 amazing feeling of agility when 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:34.090
 put in support a hedge laws of the 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:36.070
 physics then take over and 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.840
 limits curve speeds 

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:38.860
 likewise braking is biting and 

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.910
 powerful as you do not 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.910
 solicit and not too often 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.329
 in fact from the top of his 4 168 horses this 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.149
 grand cherokee is certainly not 

00:01:47.329 --> 00:01:53.119
 really the same level as x 5 mg / l 63 

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:54.530
 s amg cayenne turbo s all his rivals 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:55.700
 frankly exceed 500 horsepower and 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.049
 are closer to the four seconds 

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.670
 for the 0 to 100 than 5 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:00.920
 they are all also a lot more 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:02.569
 expensive because in the genre with only 83 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.619
 thousand roses this great cherokee is certainly 

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:05.619
 it is good business
