00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
so while that was heating up I sprayed

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.530 
so while that was heating up I sprayed
some<00:02:47.069> heat<00:02:47.250> protectants<00:02:47.819> into<00:02:48.060> my<00:02:48.150> hair<00:02:48.389> and

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:48.540 
some heat protectants into my hair and

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.929 
some heat protectants into my hair and
brushed<00:02:48.900> it<00:02:49.079> out<00:02:49.230> and<00:02:49.590> now<00:02:50.519> as<00:02:50.670> you<00:02:50.760> can<00:02:50.879> see

00:02:50.929 --> 00:02:50.939 
brushed it out and now as you can see

00:02:50.939 --> 00:02:53.059 
brushed it out and now as you can see
I'm<00:02:51.180> just<00:02:51.209> flat<00:02:51.659> ironing<00:02:52.019> my<00:02:52.109> hair<00:02:52.200> first<00:02:52.709> and

00:02:53.059 --> 00:02:53.069 
I'm just flat ironing my hair first and

00:02:53.069 --> 00:02:55.160 
I'm just flat ironing my hair first and
the<00:02:53.730> reason<00:02:53.879> it's<00:02:54.120> so<00:02:54.239> poofy<00:02:54.750> and<00:02:54.780> wave<00:02:55.019> is

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
the reason it's so poofy and wave is

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.020 
the reason it's so poofy and wave is
because<00:02:55.560> I<00:02:55.739> actually<00:02:55.950> work<00:02:56.310> currently<00:02:56.670> the

00:02:57.020 --> 00:02:57.030 
because I actually work currently the

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:58.819 
because I actually work currently the
day<00:02:57.209> before<00:02:57.420> and<00:02:58.049> as<00:02:58.260> you<00:02:58.319> can<00:02:58.470> see<00:02:58.500> I<00:02:58.620> have<00:02:58.680> my

00:02:58.819 --> 00:02:58.829 
day before and as you can see I have my

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:01.069 
day before and as you can see I have my
extensions<00:02:59.370> in<00:02:59.489> and<00:02:59.670> everything<00:03:00.120> so<00:03:00.780> more

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:01.079 
extensions in and everything so more

00:03:01.079 --> 00:03:03.110 
extensions in and everything so more
both<00:03:01.109> my<00:03:01.590> hair<00:03:01.799> and<00:03:01.980> the<00:03:02.129> extensions<00:03:02.609> curly

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
both my hair and the extensions curly

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.339 
both my hair and the extensions curly
the<00:03:03.150> day<00:03:03.389> before<00:03:03.540> so<00:03:03.840> that's<00:03:04.019> why<00:03:04.169> it's<00:03:04.200> a

00:03:04.339 --> 00:03:04.349 
the day before so that's why it's a

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:06.289 
the day before so that's why it's a
little<00:03:04.560> bit<00:03:04.650> wavy<00:03:04.919> but<00:03:05.639> I<00:03:05.700> wanted<00:03:06.030> to<00:03:06.120> use<00:03:06.269> it

00:03:06.289 --> 00:03:06.299 
little bit wavy but I wanted to use it

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:07.759 
little bit wavy but I wanted to use it
that<00:03:06.540> way<00:03:06.569> so<00:03:06.750> it's<00:03:06.989> not<00:03:07.079> like<00:03:07.230> pin<00:03:07.470> straight

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:07.769 
that way so it's not like pin straight

00:03:07.769 --> 00:03:09.319 
that way so it's not like pin straight
and<00:03:08.010> you<00:03:08.069> can<00:03:08.189> actually<00:03:08.400> see<00:03:08.700> how<00:03:08.970> the<00:03:09.030> Iron

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:09.329 
and you can actually see how the Iron

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:13.490 
and you can actually see how the Iron
Works<00:03:10.849> and<00:03:11.849> of<00:03:12.569> course<00:03:12.810> you<00:03:12.989> can<00:03:13.169> leave<00:03:13.319> the

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
Works and of course you can leave the

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.009 
Works and of course you can leave the
hairpin<00:03:14.040> straight<00:03:14.519> or<00:03:15.060> in<00:03:15.180> my<00:03:15.299> case<00:03:15.329> it's<00:03:15.900> not

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019 
hairpin straight or in my case it's not

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:17.479 
hairpin straight or in my case it's not
a<00:03:16.079> pin<00:03:16.409> straight<00:03:16.650> but<00:03:16.829> it's<00:03:16.980> just<00:03:17.129> straight

00:03:17.479 --> 00:03:17.489 
a pin straight but it's just straight

00:03:17.489 --> 00:03:20.210 
a pin straight but it's just straight
just<00:03:18.480> because<00:03:18.720> my<00:03:18.870> natural<00:03:19.200> hair<00:03:19.319> is<00:03:19.560> curly<00:03:19.950> so

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
just because my natural hair is curly so

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.220 
just because my natural hair is curly so
it's<00:03:20.340> going<00:03:20.430> to<00:03:20.489> be<00:03:20.579> that<00:03:20.849> way<00:03:20.930> but<00:03:21.930> if<00:03:22.109> you

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230 
it's going to be that way but if you

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:23.899 
it's going to be that way but if you
want<00:03:22.409> to<00:03:22.470> give<00:03:22.680> it<00:03:22.799> a<00:03:22.859> little<00:03:23.010> bit<00:03:23.220> of<00:03:23.310> a<00:03:23.370> sassy

00:03:23.899 --> 00:03:23.909 
want to give it a little bit of a sassy

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:26.240 
want to give it a little bit of a sassy
curl<00:03:24.329> whatever<00:03:24.720> you<00:03:24.930> can<00:03:25.049> curl<00:03:25.379> just<00:03:25.680> the<00:03:25.829> ends

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
curl whatever you can curl just the ends

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:28.009 
curl whatever you can curl just the ends
so<00:03:26.400> that<00:03:26.790> way<00:03:27.030> it's<00:03:27.150> not<00:03:27.269> like<00:03:27.419> a<00:03:27.569> super

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:28.019 
so that way it's not like a super

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:30.259 
so that way it's not like a super
glamorous<00:03:28.409> big<00:03:28.949> huge<00:03:29.220> cross<00:03:29.519> but<00:03:29.879> it's<00:03:30.060> just<00:03:30.209> a

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
glamorous big huge cross but it's just a

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:32.719 
glamorous big huge cross but it's just a
little<00:03:30.510> bit<00:03:30.629> cuter<00:03:31.500> and<00:03:31.650> so<00:03:32.250> have<00:03:32.400> a<00:03:32.430> whole

00:03:32.719 --> 00:03:32.729 
little bit cuter and so have a whole

00:03:32.729 --> 00:03:34.879 
little bit cuter and so have a whole
video<00:03:32.909> dedicated<00:03:33.299> to<00:03:33.690> how<00:03:34.079> to<00:03:34.139> curl<00:03:34.590> your<00:03:34.709> hair

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:34.889
