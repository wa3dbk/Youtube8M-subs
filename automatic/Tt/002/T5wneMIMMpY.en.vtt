for<00:00:01.020> whatever<00:00:01.170> reason<00:00:01.650> I<00:00:01.800> never<00:00:01.860> thought

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:02.310 
for whatever reason I never thought

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:03.740 
for whatever reason I never thought
about<00:00:02.340> if<00:00:02.790> there<00:00:02.939> could<00:00:03.060> be<00:00:03.090> anybody<00:00:03.540> else

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:03.750 
about if there could be anybody else

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:06.289 
about if there could be anybody else
like<00:00:04.020> seviche<00:00:04.560> who<00:00:05.100> had<00:00:05.310> a<00:00:05.339> parasite<00:00:06.000> in

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
like seviche who had a parasite in

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:08.089 
like seviche who had a parasite in
different<00:00:07.080> parts<00:00:07.319> of<00:00:07.379> their<00:00:07.560> body<00:00:07.799> rather

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
different parts of their body rather

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:10.430 
different parts of their body rather
than<00:00:08.250> fully<00:00:08.790> intact<00:00:09.330> inside<00:00:09.960> of<00:00:10.110> the<00:00:10.200> brain

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:10.440 
than fully intact inside of the brain

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.530 
than fully intact inside of the brain
and<00:00:11.040> in<00:00:11.160> this<00:00:11.250> episode<00:00:11.670> we<00:00:11.820> get<00:00:12.030> that<00:00:12.210> answer

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
and in this episode we get that answer

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.060 
and in this episode we get that answer
for<00:00:12.809> some<00:00:12.960> reason<00:00:13.259> like<00:00:13.469> I<00:00:13.559> said<00:00:13.769> I'd<00:00:13.920> never

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:14.070 
for some reason like I said I'd never

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.010 
for some reason like I said I'd never
thought<00:00:14.400> of<00:00:14.670> thought<00:00:15.120> of<00:00:15.240> it<00:00:15.330> like<00:00:15.480> why<00:00:15.690> I

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
thought of thought of it like why I

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.810 
thought of thought of it like why I
never<00:00:16.619> thought<00:00:16.800> of<00:00:16.949> it<00:00:16.980> I<00:00:17.130> don't<00:00:17.279> know<00:00:17.430> but<00:00:17.460> it

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
never thought of it I don't know but it

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.189 
never thought of it I don't know but it
makes<00:00:17.970> perfect<00:00:18.119> sense<00:00:18.390> if<00:00:18.720> you<00:00:18.869> mean<00:00:19.050> she's

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
makes perfect sense if you mean she's

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.170 
makes perfect sense if you mean she's
able<00:00:19.410> to<00:00:19.500> become<00:00:19.740> like<00:00:19.920> that<00:00:20.000> that<00:00:21.000> means

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
able to become like that that means

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.029 
able to become like that that means
there<00:00:21.300> could<00:00:21.359> be<00:00:21.420> other<00:00:21.630> cases<00:00:21.900> as<00:00:22.199> well<00:00:22.380> and<00:00:22.949> I

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
there could be other cases as well and I

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.370 
there could be other cases as well and I
wonder<00:00:23.279> if<00:00:23.400> Otis<00:00:23.760> on<00:00:23.970> or<00:00:24.420> rather<00:00:24.750> una<00:00:25.199> that's

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
wonder if Otis on or rather una that's

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.560 
wonder if Otis on or rather una that's
his<00:00:25.560> name<00:00:25.769> and<00:00:26.039> Shinichi<00:00:26.880> are<00:00:27.029> the<00:00:27.150> only<00:00:27.300> cases

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
his name and Shinichi are the only cases

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.330 
his name and Shinichi are the only cases
or<00:00:27.960> if<00:00:28.050> there's<00:00:28.199> anybody<00:00:28.470> else<00:00:28.680> in<00:00:28.980> similar

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:29.340 
or if there's anybody else in similar

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.279 
or if there's anybody else in similar
situations<00:00:29.970> and<00:00:30.480> maybe<00:00:30.630> we'll<00:00:30.840> see<00:00:30.990> a<00:00:31.019> few

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
situations and maybe we'll see a few

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:33.709 
situations and maybe we'll see a few
more<00:00:31.560> show<00:00:32.460> up<00:00:32.640> and<00:00:32.880> join<00:00:33.059> forces<00:00:33.090> which

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
more show up and join forces which

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.380 
more show up and join forces which
Kenichi<00:00:34.110> in<00:00:34.410> Oda<00:00:34.739> now<00:00:35.280> obviously<00:00:35.760> una<00:00:36.149> just

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
Kenichi in Oda now obviously una just

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:38.840 
Kenichi in Oda now obviously una just
calls<00:00:36.570> his<00:00:36.950> parasite<00:00:37.950> parasite<00:00:38.520> and<00:00:38.700> it's

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
calls his parasite parasite and it's

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.000 
calls his parasite parasite and it's
from<00:00:39.120> his<00:00:39.300> like<00:00:39.510> bottom<00:00:40.110> of<00:00:40.200> his<00:00:40.320> jaw<00:00:40.590> and<00:00:40.620> it

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
from his like bottom of his jaw and it

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.619 
from his like bottom of his jaw and it
was<00:00:41.100> neck<00:00:41.340> and<00:00:41.370> possibly<00:00:41.879> his<00:00:42.000> chest<00:00:42.329> and

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
was neck and possibly his chest and

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.010 
was neck and possibly his chest and
obviously<00:00:43.530> Kimmy<00:00:44.370> Chi<00:00:44.550> has<00:00:44.700> median<00:00:45.180> in<00:00:45.420> the

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
obviously Kimmy Chi has median in the

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:46.610 
obviously Kimmy Chi has median in the
right<00:00:46.200> hand

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:46.620 
right hand

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.490

I<00:00:47.550> enjoyed<00:00:48.450> the<00:00:48.600> conversation<00:00:48.780> between<00:00:49.260> the

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
I enjoyed the conversation between the

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.110 
I enjoyed the conversation between the
two<00:00:49.530> I<00:00:49.739> enjoyed<00:00:50.309> seeing<00:00:50.760> the

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
two I enjoyed seeing the

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.360 
two I enjoyed seeing the
characterization<00:00:51.899> of<00:00:52.020> una<00:00:52.410> seeing<00:00:53.039> how<00:00:53.219> he's

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
characterization of una seeing how he's

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.580 
characterization of una seeing how he's
pretty<00:00:53.640> much<00:00:53.760> a<00:00:53.820> big<00:00:54.000> crybaby<00:00:54.300> that<00:00:54.840> his<00:00:55.260> wife

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
pretty much a big crybaby that his wife

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.529 
pretty much a big crybaby that his wife
left<00:00:55.890> him<00:00:56.070> after<00:00:56.219> a<00:00:56.460> year<00:00:56.820> of<00:00:56.850> marriage<00:00:57.149> and

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
left him after a year of marriage and

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:58.790 
left him after a year of marriage and
that's<00:00:57.629> what<00:00:57.960> he<00:00:58.050> was<00:00:58.140> about<00:00:58.230> to<00:00:58.320> kill<00:00:58.590> himself

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
that's what he was about to kill himself

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.130 
that's what he was about to kill himself
and<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.489> parasite<00:00:59.969> attacked<00:01:00.359> and<00:01:00.660> the

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
and the parasite attacked and the

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.009 
and the parasite attacked and the
parasite<00:01:01.559> basically<00:01:02.100> saved<00:01:02.460> him<00:01:02.760> because<00:01:03.329> he

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
parasite basically saved him because he

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.620 
parasite basically saved him because he
was<00:01:04.199> drowning<00:01:04.530> so<00:01:05.010> a<00:01:05.339> similar<00:01:06.000> situation<00:01:06.180> to

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
was drowning so a similar situation to

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.500 
was drowning so a similar situation to
Kenichi<00:01:07.320> in<00:01:07.470> migi<00:01:07.740> in<00:01:08.010> a<00:01:08.100> sense<00:01:08.340> when<00:01:08.610> migi

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
Kenichi in migi in a sense when migi

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.510 
Kenichi in migi in a sense when migi
saved<00:01:09.869> Kenichi<00:01:10.470> by<00:01:10.619> you<00:01:10.890> know<00:01:11.010> venting<00:01:11.369> his

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
saved Kenichi by you know venting his

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:13.490 
saved Kenichi by you know venting his
heart<00:01:11.790> now<00:01:12.420> my<00:01:12.689> assumptions<00:01:13.350> were<00:01:13.470> correct

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
heart now my assumptions were correct

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.499 
heart now my assumptions were correct
that<00:01:14.070> basically<00:01:14.880> me<00:01:15.150> because<00:01:15.540> of<00:01:15.689> merged<00:01:16.170> with

00:01:17.499 --> 00:01:17.509 
that basically me because of merged with

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:21.289 
that basically me because of merged with
CDG's<00:01:18.540> overall<00:01:19.439> system<00:01:19.920> and<00:01:20.189> basically<00:01:20.880> we

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
CDG's overall system and basically we

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.450 
CDG's overall system and basically we
find<00:01:21.509> out<00:01:21.630> that<00:01:21.780> me<00:01:21.960> can't<00:01:22.320> meet<00:01:22.619> I<00:01:23.040> don't<00:01:23.400> know

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
find out that me can't meet I don't know

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.940 
find out that me can't meet I don't know
if<00:01:23.549> it's<00:01:23.670> specific<00:01:24.180> to<00:01:24.570> him<00:01:24.840> or<00:01:25.380> if<00:01:25.500> other<00:01:25.710> ones

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
if it's specific to him or if other ones

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.560 
if it's specific to him or if other ones
can<00:01:26.130> do<00:01:26.280> this<00:01:26.490> I'm<00:01:26.670> going<00:01:26.909> to<00:01:27.000> assume<00:01:27.270> just

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
can do this I'm going to assume just

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.420 
can do this I'm going to assume just
because<00:01:27.600> miggy's<00:01:28.350> learned<00:01:28.619> how<00:01:28.740> to<00:01:28.799> do<00:01:29.070> it<00:01:29.250> so

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
because miggy's learned how to do it so

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.789 
because miggy's learned how to do it so
far<00:01:29.460> he<00:01:30.390> can<00:01:30.540> separate<00:01:31.049> and<00:01:31.170> make<00:01:31.290> clones<00:01:31.590> of

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
far he can separate and make clones of

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.010 
far he can separate and make clones of
himself<00:01:31.860> but<00:01:32.729> as<00:01:32.880> he<00:01:33.060> separates<00:01:33.540> over<00:01:33.869> and

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
himself but as he separates over and

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.319 
himself but as he separates over and
over<00:01:34.259> again<00:01:34.380> they<00:01:35.130> become<00:01:35.460> less<00:01:35.640> intelligent

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
over again they become less intelligent

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.330 
over again they become less intelligent
they<00:01:36.509> can<00:01:36.630> do<00:01:36.750> less<00:01:37.079> but<00:01:37.320> he<00:01:37.740> has<00:01:37.860> to<00:01:38.100> make<00:01:38.310> one

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
they can do less but he has to make one

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:40.819 
they can do less but he has to make one
directive<00:01:39.180> and<00:01:39.299> that<00:01:39.420> is<00:01:39.570> to<00:01:39.780> come<00:01:40.409> back<00:01:40.590> as

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
directive and that is to come back as

probably could gonna get introduced to

00:05:38.639 --> 00:05:42.379 
probably could gonna get introduced to
new<00:05:38.849> parasite<00:05:39.510> hosts<00:05:40.050> and<00:05:40.260> I<00:05:41.099> obviously<00:05:41.940> the

00:05:42.379 --> 00:05:42.389 
new parasite hosts and I obviously the

00:05:42.389 --> 00:05:44.930 
new parasite hosts and I obviously the
story's<00:05:42.690> not<00:05:42.720> over<00:05:43.010> but<00:05:44.010> now<00:05:44.160> Shinichi<00:05:44.760> is

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:44.940 
story's not over but now Shinichi is

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:47.570 
story's not over but now Shinichi is
more<00:05:45.539> control<00:05:46.050> of<00:05:46.260> his<00:05:46.740> abilities<00:05:47.370> more

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:47.580 
more control of his abilities more

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:49.879 
more control of his abilities more
control<00:05:48.150> of<00:05:48.419> being<00:05:48.990> able<00:05:49.110> to<00:05:49.260> protect<00:05:49.680> himself

00:05:49.879 --> 00:05:49.889 
control of being able to protect himself

00:05:49.889 --> 00:05:52.820 
control of being able to protect himself
so<00:05:50.460> I<00:05:50.669> wonder<00:05:51.389> if<00:05:51.419> Tommy<00:05:51.810> asan<00:05:52.229> will<00:05:52.410> pose<00:05:52.620> any

00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:52.830 
so I wonder if Tommy asan will pose any

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:54.140 
so I wonder if Tommy asan will pose any
kind<00:05:53.070> of<00:05:53.190> threat<00:05:53.490> and<00:05:53.520> he'll<00:05:53.729> have<00:05:53.849> to<00:05:54.000> do

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:54.150 
kind of threat and he'll have to do

00:05:54.150 --> 00:05:56.330 
kind of threat and he'll have to do
battle<00:05:54.389> with<00:05:54.539> her<00:05:54.780> and<00:05:55.470> I'll<00:05:55.590> obviously<00:05:55.889> be

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:56.340 
battle with her and I'll obviously be

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:58.550 
battle with her and I'll obviously be
obviously<00:05:57.240> be<00:05:57.360> a<00:05:57.389> much<00:05:57.599> more<00:05:57.810> harder<00:05:58.169> battle

00:05:58.550 --> 00:05:58.560 
obviously be a much more harder battle

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:00.379 
obviously be a much more harder battle
than<00:05:59.070> with<00:05:59.280> the<00:05:59.400> parasite<00:05:59.910> that<00:06:00.060> took<00:06:00.240> over

00:06:00.379 --> 00:06:00.389 
than with the parasite that took over

00:06:00.389 --> 00:06:01.850 
than with the parasite that took over
his<00:06:00.630> mother<00:06:00.870> because<00:06:01.229> Tommy<00:06:01.500> Hassan's

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:01.860 
his mother because Tommy Hassan's

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:04.370 
his mother because Tommy Hassan's
parasite<00:06:02.430> Herbert<00:06:03.120> Muhammad<00:06:03.690> rationed<00:06:04.229> rate

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:04.380 
parasite Herbert Muhammad rationed rate

00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:07.159 
parasite Herbert Muhammad rationed rate
is<00:06:04.530> a<00:06:04.560> lot<00:06:04.830> higher<00:06:05.699> and<00:06:06.030> a<00:06:06.090> lot<00:06:06.240> more<00:06:06.270> efficient

00:06:07.159 --> 00:06:07.169 
is a lot higher and a lot more efficient

00:06:07.169 --> 00:06:09.589
