the<00:03:14.050> sheet<00:03:14.290> metal<00:03:14.590> screws<00:03:14.890> so<00:03:15.040> you<00:03:15.129> don't<00:03:15.250> have

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
the sheet metal screws so you don't have

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.130 
the sheet metal screws so you don't have
to<00:03:15.400> worry<00:03:15.550> about<00:03:15.730> going<00:03:15.879> super<00:03:16.330> tight<00:03:16.540> what<00:03:17.110> I
