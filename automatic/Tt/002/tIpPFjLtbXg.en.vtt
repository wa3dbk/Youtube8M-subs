00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:03.020
 Y 

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:07.080
 i 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:17.270
 the most exciting experiences for 

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:19.790
 any pilot is the power to fly to 

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:22.220
 blinds by instruments or what 

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:24.290
 we call instrument flight rose every 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:26.810
 time the sky is cloudy and we lose 

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:28.550
 the natural horizon of view we are 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:31.550
 forced to look at the instruments 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:33.770
 to fly control and land the 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.660
 plane and in this video we will have the 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:40.270
 opportunity to experiment for some 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:40.270
 minutes that exciting experience 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:52.640
 and of course long before that 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.559
 let's begin our journey we will have 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:57.140
 had the opportunity to hear the 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:59.960
 air that is he webber the climate of how 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:01.400
 is the airport of our destination and 

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.829
 that will give us the opportunity to 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.690
 understand what kind of approach is of type 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:08.390
 of approximation by instruments are 

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:10.130
 pulling at the airport in particular 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.650
 we are going to have the opportunity to 

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:15.730
 prepare to select the approximate and 

00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:17.800
 concentrate on putting all beings 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:20.770
 before we enter the clouds is 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:23.080
 extremely important to concentrate 

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.060
 in the instruments of the planes you see 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:28.030
 an average of 16 seconds get used to 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:30.610
 to the instruments before entering the 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.620
 clouds so that if one does not put 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.450
 attention in the instruments before 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:37.500
 entering the clouds is something very 

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:40.720
 disorientate t is a very sensation 

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:42.490
 unpleasant are in order to prevent it 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:45.700
 we focus on the instruments 

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:47.560
 before entering and instruments 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:50.170
 Become our best friends 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.320
 they are the ones who tell us the attitude 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:55.810
 of the plane if we go up or down 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.520
 we go around the left or the 

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:00.160
 right because one of the main 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:03.280
 things that the human body experiences 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:06.220
 when it enters the clouds is the fact 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:08.350
 disorientating what is above is no longer 

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:10.860
 above what is below is no longer work 

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.490
 and it is a disorientation 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:15.730
 completely 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:18.250
 great in the life of the pilot has only 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:21.220
 to get used to ignoring the 

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:23.560
 sensations of the body and concentrate and 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:26.200
 Believe the instruments the 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.840
 instruments do not get disoriented do not 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.060
 They do not get sick and they are our 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.280
 best friends especially when one 

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.440
 is going in and out in and out 

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:36.819
 from the clouds the clouds can give 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.340
 one one 

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:43.150
 disorient effect giving you a 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:46.599
 false horizon and that therefore we have 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:48.060
 to concentrate on the instruments in 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:51.480
 the A 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:54.870
 today they are on the artificial horizon that 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:57.300
 we have on the plane extremely 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:59.580
 important to ignore what one feels is 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:01.290
 a habit that takes hours 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:04.830
 develop it but at the end of accounts 

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:07.019
 that is simply a habit as they can 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:11.330
 see here we have all the instruments 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:13.709
 needed in the garmin system 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:16.170
 every time we enter and leave the 

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:19.440
 clouds the clouds can give us the effect 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:21.629
 of a false horizon about the darlings 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.370
 the illusion on the occasion that we go 

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:25.680
 clogs that we are going around the 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:28.630
 right or left when in 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:31.000
 reality is not 

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:33.220
 and that it is imperative to check the 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.860
 instruments to concentrate on them and 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:38.170
 ignore everything that is outside 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:40.510
 especially as in this case that 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:42.280
 we are coming down from the clouds the 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:45.070
 effect is very disoriented because no 

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:47.620
 we have enough visibility below 

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:52.840
 the clouds is usually accompanied 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:58.030
 with hays fort hays and rain and still in 

00:03:52.840 --> 00:04:01.090
 the earth the way the soil has 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:04.120
 can give us wrong horizons 

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:07.240
 false horizons or a combination of 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:10.240
 the clouds and the earth the rain the 

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:14.050
 haze and obstacles around if 

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:16.750
 there are mountains can give us an illusion and 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:19.450
 that can create in us vertigo what 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:20.260
 which can lead to an accident 

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:23.980
 catastrophic 

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:26.380
 once we get off outside the 

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:28.420
 clouds and through the irish by means 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:31.030
 from the weather, we are going to give us a very 

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:33.340
 correct of how are the bases of the 

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:34.750
 clouds we have no idea where we're going 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:36.580
 to break down 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:39.160
 the first thing we're going to see below the 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:42.000
 clouds paradoxically are the lights of 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:44.710
 the track a lot of people expect to see the track 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.270
 in front when one of the clouds goes down 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:49.150
 but really what you see first 

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:53.860
 are the lights of the track and it's there 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:56.560
 where one recognizes what surrounds the 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:58.690
 track around it is imperative to recognize 

00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:00.970
 the track by means of the lights because 

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:03.130
 there are usually other lights around 

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:05.770
 of the cities that can give us the 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:07.930
 idea of â€‹â€‹a wrong track in many 

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:09.700
 accidents have happened because the pilot 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:11.920
 has landed on the road 

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:14.260
 they confused the street lights with 

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:16.240
 the lights of the track we have to 

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:19.030
 identify the track and we have to 

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:21.460
 identify the marks the signs the 

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:23.920
 lines the track lights and 

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:24.910
 make sure we're on the track 

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:28.060
 on the street 

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:30.550
 once we leave the active track 

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:34.150
 the control tower will give us clarins 

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:35.740
 protection where we should stop and 

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:40.009
 this is one of the most 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:42.740
 amazing that a pilot can have 

00:05:40.009 --> 00:05:44.689
 I hope you enjoyed it seemed 

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:46.339
 which is considerably difficult 

00:05:44.689 --> 00:05:47.869
 achieve it the only thing I can tell you is 

00:05:46.339 --> 00:05:50.050
 with practice training 

00:05:47.869 --> 00:05:52.849
 adequate you will also be able to achieve it 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:54.529
 unfortunately in the USA 51 by 

00:05:52.849 --> 00:05:57.110
 percent of aviation accidents 

00:05:54.529 --> 00:05:59.539
 general occur because the pilot loses 

00:05:57.110 --> 00:06:01.969
 reference to the natural horizon of 

00:05:59.539 --> 00:06:04.270
 there that we are obliged to dedicate 

00:06:01.969 --> 00:06:08.149
 time to instrument training 

00:06:04.270 --> 00:06:13.029
 be safe that you look for safe in farm 

00:06:08.149 --> 00:06:13.029
 keep the skies safe and fun
