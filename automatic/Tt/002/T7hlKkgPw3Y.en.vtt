00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.740
 fear of veterans I'll repeat it a 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.740
 more time here we do not admit weak 

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:14.429
 I was kidding the truth is that I'm very 

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:16.109
 excited I can not believe we will have 

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:20.050
 a battle hydrate on a track so 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:22.269
 dangerous again 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:25.960
 let's see how long it will last with that 

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:31.109
 enthusiasm the battle will be held at 

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:31.109
 dawn when the sun comes out super 

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:44.140
 they are going to have a battle with those humans 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:46.420
 tomorrow morning on the bridge there 

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:49.390
 matter what happens I will earn them a 

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.940
 charge of the mtb thanks I want 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:54.730
 Thank you 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:59.320
 I do not want to bother you but they're still 

00:00:54.730 --> 00:01:00.580
 time they must give up takes because what 

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.800
 He says 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:06.310
 I heard that these brothers are very 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:10.390
 cruel I do not know what they are capable of 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:12.130
 it will be fine lady could you tell us a 

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.910
 little more about them guardians of 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:14.910
 that door 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:26.390
 the guardians is called andrew and I do 

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:28.560
 time they used to be good men 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:31.229
 heart 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:34.140
 they always practiced happily with their 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.060
 mtb until one day they went to the 

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:38.700
 city ​​of xis with the hope of 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.720
 become the best cyclists to 

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:41.720
 less that I dreamed 

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:50.010
 both left their techniques and were the 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:51.930
 most popular m3 cyclists here 

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:53.740
 but that was just the beginning of the 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.560
 tragedy 

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.750
 because out he found out their names and 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.530
 he asked them to go immediately to the 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:05.310
 famous city x 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:08.039
 and they both left very happy 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.860
 germany we will finally get into the 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:14.540
 city ​​of xis so they say here 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.540
 Any wish can be fulfilled 

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:21.400
 for them the city x was the capital of 

00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:23.950
 I dream, however, the only thing that 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:28.740
 he hoped was the dirty betrayal of his 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.740
 friends and trials full of suffering 

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:34.769
 very well let's start with the battle and 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:36.690
 date style will be free if you 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:40.080
 they manage to defeat my men I promise 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:42.030
 that I will fulfill any wish but 

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:45.349
 if they lose they will become my 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.349
 slaves is clear 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:51.910
 brother let's find a way to win 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:54.840
 so that we can make our dream come true 

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:54.840
 In this city 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:16.459
 to help me I hurt my leg 

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:18.940
 wait I'll help you joe wait hear you 

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:18.940
 you find good 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:25.370
 take this by hand 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:37.269
 and wait losers kneel in front 

00:03:33.849 --> 00:03:39.280
 to his master from this moment and 

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:40.930
 until eternity they can work 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.350
 as guardians of the gate of the 

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:44.600
 cities 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:47.720
 now your job will be to end the 

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:51.800
 dreams of all the naive such as 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:55.150
 it happened to you here the most 

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:55.150
 important is to win 

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:06.420
 and since then the brothers stopped 

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:10.560
 trust people 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:12.900
 sunset river and sunrise joe 

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:15.270
 when they started to be called like that and the 

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:18.440
 people were very afraid and almost never 

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:18.440
 they approach there 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:27.160
 we admire the sunset every day 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:29.380
 and yet it is a painful memory 

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:32.970
 when I think I can smash pieces 

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:32.970
 That child I feel motivated 

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:38.020
 my brother you think that what we are 

00:04:35.349 --> 00:04:39.879
 doing what is right what madness is 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:42.930
 is saying we were about 

00:04:39.879 --> 00:04:45.310
 naive but if we stop being it 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:49.509
 we will probably go back to the city of 

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:52.210
 you do not believe brother yes but do not be 

00:04:49.509 --> 00:04:54.669
 silly being strong means everything to me 

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:56.710
 it's no use having dreams and 

00:04:54.669 --> 00:04:59.939
 feelings in this life 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:03.510
 for having them present that day 

00:04:59.939 --> 00:05:07.340
 we lost our freedom 

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:07.340
 I want to have that horrible memory 

00:05:08.969 --> 00:05:15.190
 this city has no salvation and everything 

00:05:12.179 --> 00:05:18.040
 because of the selfishness of gabo 

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:20.080
 we are just losers what 

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:23.580
 The only thing left for us is to do away with 

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:23.580
 hopes of the weak 

00:05:24.819 --> 00:05:32.300
 but it is not what you believe because a 

00:05:29.990 --> 00:05:34.939
 mtpe does not serve to harm the 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:39.069
 we are talking about a wonderful sport 

00:05:34.939 --> 00:05:39.069
 and help create great friendships 

00:05:42.550 --> 00:05:48.090
 I hope that the feeling of I achieve 

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:48.090
 get to those men 

00:05:50.420 --> 00:05:53.800
 and me
