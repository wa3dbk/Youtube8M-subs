tonight pronounced Harvey on but that's
just<00:00:14.370> me<00:00:14.519> I<00:00:14.549> think<00:00:14.839> we're<00:00:15.839> going<00:00:15.990> for<00:00:16.760> the

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
just me I think we're going for the

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:19.250 
just me I think we're going for the
electrolytes<00:00:18.270> the<00:00:18.359> bad<00:00:18.539> in<00:00:18.810> there<00:00:18.960> that's

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
electrolytes the bad in there that's

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.269 
electrolytes the bad in there that's
kind<00:00:19.529> of<00:00:19.619> you<00:00:19.980> know<00:00:20.070> carbohydrates<00:00:22.279> the

00:00:23.269 --> 00:00:23.279 
kind of you know carbohydrates the

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:25.250 
kind of you know carbohydrates the
electrolytes<00:00:23.820> has<00:00:24.090> like<00:00:24.300> the<00:00:24.449> ion<00:00:24.750> kind<00:00:25.170> of

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
electrolytes has like the ion kind of

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.849 
electrolytes has like the ion kind of
thing<00:00:25.439> to<00:00:25.619> it<00:00:25.769> so<00:00:26.039> makes<00:00:26.910> sense<00:00:27.619> we<00:00:28.619> got<00:00:28.740> this

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
thing to it so makes sense we got this

very you know fluent as far as how these
kind<00:01:10.200> of<00:01:10.229> carbohydrates<00:01:10.770> are<00:01:10.890> gonna<00:01:10.979> work<00:01:11.159> in

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
kind of carbohydrates are gonna work in

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.600 
kind of carbohydrates are gonna work in
your<00:01:11.400> body<00:01:12.500> to<00:01:13.500> you<00:01:13.920> know<00:01:14.010> the<00:01:14.159> best<00:01:14.340> of<00:01:14.490> my

your body to you know the best of my
understanding<00:01:14.640> is<00:01:16.130> opposed<00:01:17.130> to<00:01:17.340> just<00:01:17.759> pure

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
understanding is opposed to just pure

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.050 
understanding is opposed to just pure
dextrose<00:01:18.689> what<00:01:19.500> they're<00:01:19.650> saying<00:01:19.860> is<00:01:20.159> you<00:01:20.939> know

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
dextrose what they're saying is you know

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.609 
dextrose what they're saying is you know
if<00:01:21.420> you<00:01:21.810> have<00:01:21.990> a<00:01:22.820> budget<00:01:23.820> and<00:01:24.240> you<00:01:25.170> just<00:01:25.380> want

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
if you have a budget and you just want

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:29.990 
if you have a budget and you just want
that<00:01:26.119> post-workout<00:01:27.119> insulin<00:01:27.920> boost<00:01:28.920> you<00:01:29.909> know

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
that post-workout insulin boost you know

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.789 
that post-workout insulin boost you know
what<00:01:30.150> dextrose<00:01:30.600> really<00:01:31.079> isn't<00:01:31.320> all<00:01:31.560> that<00:01:31.619> bad

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
what dextrose really isn't all that bad

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:34.429 
what dextrose really isn't all that bad
but<00:01:32.280> if<00:01:33.240> you<00:01:33.509> want<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:33.990> you<00:01:34.170> know<00:01:34.259> the

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:34.439 
but if you want the you know the

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:39.410 
but if you want the you know the
absolute<00:01:35.009> you<00:01:35.579> know<00:01:35.670> best<00:01:36.710> carbohydrate<00:01:38.420> this

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
absolute you know best carbohydrate this

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.090 
absolute you know best carbohydrate this
this<00:01:40.020> is<00:01:40.140> where<00:01:40.259> all<00:01:40.290> max<00:01:40.590> is<00:01:40.710> kind<00:01:40.890> of<00:01:40.920> going

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
this is where all max is kind of going

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.490 
this is where all max is kind of going
with<00:01:41.340> and<00:01:41.610> what<00:01:41.880> they're<00:01:42.060> saying<00:01:42.360> is<00:01:42.540> that<00:01:42.750> ya

with and what they're saying is that ya

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.530 
with and what they're saying is that ya
next<00:01:43.770> dose<00:01:43.950> is<00:01:44.100> pretty<00:01:44.520> much<00:01:44.610> the<00:01:45.149> smallest

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
next dose is pretty much the smallest

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.710 
next dose is pretty much the smallest
simplest<00:01:46.140> sugar<00:01:46.530> and<00:01:46.829> it<00:01:46.920> is<00:01:47.070> absorbed

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:47.720 
simplest sugar and it is absorbed

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.920 
simplest sugar and it is absorbed
extremely<00:01:48.720> quick<00:01:49.850> but<00:01:50.850> its<00:01:51.329> absorbed

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
extremely quick but its absorbed

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.800 
extremely quick but its absorbed
extremely<00:01:52.470> quick<00:01:52.710> once<00:01:53.490> it<00:01:53.759> exits<00:01:54.509> your

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:54.810 
extremely quick once it exits your

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.289 
extremely quick once it exits your
stomach<00:01:55.229> and<00:01:55.409> it<00:01:56.219> can<00:01:56.430> actually<00:01:56.790> take<00:01:57.000> up<00:01:57.180> to

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
stomach and it can actually take up to

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.120 
stomach and it can actually take up to
30<00:01:57.570> minutes<00:01:57.689> to<00:01:58.140> exit<00:01:58.530> your<00:01:58.619> stomach<00:01:59.040> because

30 minutes to exit your stomach because

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.550 
30 minutes to exit your stomach because
what<00:01:59.430> happens<00:01:59.790> is<00:01:59.939> dextrose<00:02:00.360> and<00:02:00.689> simple

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
what happens is dextrose and simple

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.459 
what happens is dextrose and simple
sugars<00:02:01.890> have<00:02:02.040> a<00:02:02.070> different<00:02:02.460> pH<00:02:02.790> then<00:02:03.570> let's

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:04.469 
sugars have a different pH then let's

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.640 
sugars have a different pH then let's
say<00:02:04.710> what<00:02:04.920> they've<00:02:05.070> also<00:02:05.250> added<00:02:05.520> here<00:02:05.939> is

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:06.650 
say what they've also added here is

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:08.950 
say what they've also added here is
hi<00:02:07.119> make<00:02:08.119> sure<00:02:08.270> it's<00:02:08.420> right<00:02:08.540> high<00:02:08.780> molecular

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:08.960 
hi make sure it's right high molecular

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:13.060 
hi make sure it's right high molecular
weight<00:02:10.960> ultra-high<00:02:11.960> molecular<00:02:12.110> waxy<00:02:12.920> maize

weight ultra-high molecular waxy maize
sorry<00:02:13.990> that's<00:02:14.990> gonna<00:02:15.290> have<00:02:15.530> the<00:02:16.160> correct<00:02:16.610> pH

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
sorry that's gonna have the correct pH

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.850 
sorry that's gonna have the correct pH
so<00:02:17.600> let's<00:02:17.720> happen<00:02:18.050> is<00:02:18.140> that's<00:02:18.380> gonna<00:02:18.560> shoot

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
so let's happen is that's gonna shoot

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.040 
so let's happen is that's gonna shoot
right<00:02:19.070> through<00:02:19.510> right<00:02:20.510> into<00:02:20.750> the<00:02:20.870> small

that's where you know a lot of the you
know<00:02:26.690> is<00:02:26.900> waxy<00:02:27.350> maize<00:02:27.500> you<00:02:28.010> know<00:02:28.100> a<00:02:28.130> good<00:02:28.340> car

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:28.580 
know is waxy maize you know a good car

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:31.270 
know is waxy maize you know a good car
was<00:02:28.790> just<00:02:28.970> cheap<00:02:29.210> or<00:02:29.390> whatever<00:02:29.630> like<00:02:29.720> that<00:02:30.280> it

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.280 
was just cheap or whatever like that it

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:34.150 
was just cheap or whatever like that it
doesn't<00:02:31.610> exit<00:02:31.850> or<00:02:32.000> enter<00:02:32.240> any<00:02:32.780> you<00:02:33.140> know<00:02:33.290> it

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:34.160 
doesn't exit or enter any you know it

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:35.950

doesn't enter the bloodstream and any

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:38.140 
doesn't enter the bloodstream and any
quicker<00:02:36.290> than<00:02:36.590> let's<00:02:36.890> say<00:02:36.950> dextrose<00:02:37.520> however

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150 
quicker than let's say dextrose however

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:40.960 
quicker than let's say dextrose however
it<00:02:38.360> does<00:02:38.570> get<00:02:39.080> right<00:02:39.830> past<00:02:40.160> your<00:02:40.550> stomach

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:40.970 
it does get right past your stomach

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.500 
it does get right past your stomach
quicker<00:02:41.390> than<00:02:41.630> dextrose<00:02:42.160> so<00:02:43.160> they<00:02:43.880> threw<00:02:44.180> six

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:44.510 
quicker than dextrose so they threw six

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.390 
quicker than dextrose so they threw six
different<00:02:44.720> carb<00:02:45.140> sources<00:02:45.590> into<00:02:46.010> this<00:02:46.130> as
