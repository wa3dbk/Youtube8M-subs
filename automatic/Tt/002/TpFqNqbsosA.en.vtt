00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.650
 I wielded the nothing soft life dick and you 

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:16.710
 You can even try but you will not. 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:19.320
 get away from the cup or the subject 

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:22.800
 Have a good cup and if no one is here to 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:25.650
 represent Brazil, I think it is 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.410
 yellow and blue was then the 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.750
 next to get I am not a fan 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.910
 and leaves him there for those who do not 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.190
 know the new google it is now 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.920

 And on top of the world cup, I'm going 

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:43.559
 make a quick video of some 

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:45.870
 voice commands that I discover if you 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:50.100
 type in google world cup he already 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:52.559
 It'll give you a little table but it's there. 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.949
 some voice commands that I was going to 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:58.170
 trying to find out more than he 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.480
 answer also right now why google 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.590
 does not speak Portuguese in all 

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:04.470
 devices 

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:07.080
 this video is worth to anyone who has 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.000
 android as for anyone who uses iphone or 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.310
 tablet or ipad nÃ© 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.049
 I 'm here with flex engine because he 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.110
 will answer me even if the screen is 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:19.590
 So let's go and test here. 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:21.240
 the basics of the information he gives me 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.659
 about the world cup I'm going to draw now 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:28.070
 the microphone near my mouth to 

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:29.610
 to get closer is his response. 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:35.130
 by cellphone 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:37.610
 just a moment and let's go there ok go now canopy 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.610
 of the world 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:47.770
 there are three matches between participants 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:50.259
 known today the match between Switzerland and 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:52.570

00:01:55.539 --> 00:02:01.600
 hours and point 

00:01:57.039 --> 00:02:05.740
 I now know that for example Spain and 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:09.849
 holland will play and I do not remember when it goes 

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:18.420

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:21.610
 result of the game spain and holland a 

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.970

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.970
 years 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.239

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.690

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:47.590
 hence he said everyone played 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:50.400
 I believe that who is in the bank also 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:55.840
 Reservation is not here reservations 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:58.290

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:12.250
 between colombia and greece 

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:14.019
 Look at the missing finishes 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.350
 ball in the corner defense without 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:25.150
 impediments and blah blah blah 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:27.450
 what the next world cup game there 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:30.489
 three matches between participants 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:33.850
 known today this was the same 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:36.819
 result of searching world cup 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:38.889
 we will test if it informs which were 

00:03:36.819 --> 00:03:41.440
 which were yesterday's games 

00:03:38.889 --> 00:03:44.040
 what were the games of yesterday for the 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:44.040
 world Cup 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:53.990
 there are four matches between participants 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:56.690
 known from colombia ticket 

00:03:53.990 --> 00:04:00.140
 It's blue an hour on end between Uruguayan 

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:04.370
 and Costa Rica at 4 o'clock well 

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:08.030
 female voice does not have this ability to 

00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:11.140
 say it was one hour or it was two o'clock 

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:14.990
 hours she says like she's a present 

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:17.560
 one thing I would very much like the 

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:20.239
 google did implement 

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:24.820
 especially for those who are following 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:28.190
 games is to create reminders when 

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:32.750
 klaus reminders of the next game I 

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:35.120
 I tried, for example, the court created 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:37.420
 reminder for the next game in the 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:37.420
 world 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:45.380
 it prompts you to create a reminder only 

00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:47.870
 he will tell me when and where 

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:50.780
 or where is the location if I 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:52.010
 arrive at a certain place it goes 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:54.740
 remind me of that 

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:57.350
 or when it is the time of the game but if I 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:05:01.400
 I do not know the game schedule would be very 

00:04:57.350 --> 00:05:05.000
 interesting that he is already in the score 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:07.100
 for example create a reminder 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.460
 for the next game between Honduras and 

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:09.460
 Ecuador 

00:05:14.189 --> 00:05:22.240
 there is one more time 

00:05:19.689 --> 00:05:26.259
 He thinks it's when they get there when 

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:29.349
 arrive at the equator that should remind me and 

00:05:26.259 --> 00:05:32.830
 not when he told me he asked me the 

00:05:29.349 --> 00:05:36.520
 so unfortunately he is not 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:37.900
 creating reminders thank you for having 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:39.939
 until now, these have been the 

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:43.330
 voice commands that I got 

00:05:39.939 --> 00:05:44.770
