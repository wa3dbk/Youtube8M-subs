00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:12.110 
okay we're gonna start out with

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:15.369 
okay we're gonna start out with
Photoshop<00:00:12.799> and<00:00:13.250> then<00:00:13.670> the<00:00:14.570> first<00:00:14.839> of<00:00:14.990> all<00:00:15.110> in

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:15.379 
Photoshop and then the first of all in

00:00:15.379 --> 00:00:17.080 
Photoshop and then the first of all in
the<00:00:15.650> artwork<00:00:15.919> here<00:00:16.279> we're<00:00:16.490> looking<00:00:16.760> at<00:00:16.939> the

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:17.090 
the artwork here we're looking at the

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:18.790 
the artwork here we're looking at the
checkerboard<00:00:17.480> in<00:00:17.720> the<00:00:17.779> back<00:00:17.960> that's<00:00:18.289> a<00:00:18.529> clue

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:18.800 
checkerboard in the back that's a clue

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.859 
checkerboard in the back that's a clue
that<00:00:18.830> we<00:00:19.130> have<00:00:19.369> a<00:00:19.400> transparent<00:00:20.210> background<00:00:20.359> so

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:20.869 
that we have a transparent background so

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:22.800 
that we have a transparent background so
if<00:00:21.529> we<00:00:21.680> have<00:00:21.800> the<00:00:21.890> artwork<00:00:22.070> set<00:00:22.460> up<00:00:22.580> with

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:22.810 
if we have the artwork set up with

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:25.450 
if we have the artwork set up with
transparent<00:00:23.810> background<00:00:24.250> makes<00:00:25.250> it<00:00:25.340> a<00:00:25.400> little

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:25.460 
transparent background makes it a little

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:27.820 
transparent background makes it a little
bit<00:00:25.640> easier<00:00:25.939> work<00:00:26.179> in<00:00:26.390> printing<00:00:27.380> these<00:00:27.529> dark

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:27.830 
bit easier work in printing these dark

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:30.519 
bit easier work in printing these dark
shirts<00:00:28.130> now<00:00:29.090> if<00:00:29.210> we<00:00:29.330> go<00:00:29.449> over<00:00:29.599> here<00:00:29.779> to<00:00:29.840> the

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:30.529 
shirts now if we go over here to the

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:31.419 
shirts now if we go over here to the
layers

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:31.429

here that has no color we're gonna go

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:09.160 
here that has no color we're gonna go
back<00:01:08.150> to<00:01:08.210> the<00:01:08.390> bucket<00:01:08.780> and<00:01:08.930> we're<00:01:09.020> going<00:01:09.140> to

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
back to the bucket and we're going to

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.210 
back to the bucket and we're going to
drop<00:01:09.410> in<00:01:09.880> the<00:01:10.880> white<00:01:11.150> ink<00:01:11.390> into<00:01:12.350> here<00:01:12.680> you

drop in the white ink into here you
might<00:01:13.400> not<00:01:13.550> see<00:01:13.850> it<00:01:13.880> here<00:01:14.150> because<00:01:14.300> the<00:01:14.420> black

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:14.660 
might not see it here because the black

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:16.300 
might not see it here because the black
layer<00:01:14.990> is<00:01:15.200> on<00:01:15.350> top<00:01:15.560> of<00:01:15.590> the<00:01:15.770> white<00:01:15.950> but<00:01:16.160> if<00:01:16.250> you

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
layer is on top of the white but if you

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:17.710 
layer is on top of the white but if you
look<00:01:16.460> over<00:01:16.670> here<00:01:16.700> you'll<00:01:16.940> see<00:01:17.000> that<00:01:17.300> it<00:01:17.510> did

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:17.720 
look over here you'll see that it did

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:20.320 
look over here you'll see that it did
turn<00:01:17.930> white<00:01:18.430> so<00:01:19.430> now<00:01:19.790> we've<00:01:19.970> already<00:01:20.090> got<00:01:20.270> two

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:20.330 
turn white so now we've already got two

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.120 
turn white so now we've already got two
layers<00:01:20.720> that<00:01:21.020> are<00:01:21.080> already<00:01:21.350> named<00:01:21.740> so<00:01:22.040> I'm

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
layers that are already named so I'm

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.370 
layers that are already named so I'm
gonna<00:01:22.220> go<00:01:22.370> ahead<00:01:22.430> and<00:01:22.580> delete<00:01:22.820> these<00:01:23.090> to<00:01:23.390> do

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
gonna go ahead and delete these to do

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.590 
gonna go ahead and delete these to do
the<00:01:24.470> trash<00:01:24.680> can't<00:01:25.010> get<00:01:25.130> rid<00:01:25.250> of<00:01:25.310> that<00:01:25.400> one<00:01:25.670> and

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:30.700 
get rid of this one so now we have a
white<00:01:28.430> layer<00:01:28.700> and<00:01:28.940> a<00:01:29.000> black<00:01:29.240> layer<00:01:29.480> if<00:01:30.230> we<00:01:30.470> turn

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:30.710 
white layer and a black layer if we turn

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:32.310 
white layer and a black layer if we turn
on<00:01:30.830> the<00:01:30.920> white<00:01:31.070> layer<00:01:31.340> you'll<00:01:31.580> see<00:01:31.790> it<00:01:31.909> show<00:01:32.120> up

it<00:03:40.410> white<00:03:40.680> on<00:03:40.950> black<00:03:41.190> so<00:03:41.519> it<00:03:41.639> has<00:03:41.790> the<00:03:41.970> white

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
it white on black so it has the white

other way it's reversed it's kind of

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:46.039
