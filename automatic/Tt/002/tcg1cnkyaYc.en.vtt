so the next color is this color called
blushing<00:02:34.390> which<00:02:34.660> is<00:02:34.990> like<00:02:35.440> really<00:02:36.160> really

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
blushing which is like really really

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:38.460 
blushing which is like really really
pretty<00:02:36.670> it's<00:02:36.940> like<00:02:37.060> a<00:02:37.090> blush<00:02:37.450> color<00:02:37.780> but<00:02:38.350> you

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:38.470 
pretty it's like a blush color but you

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.320 
pretty it's like a blush color but you
used<00:02:38.710> on<00:02:38.860> your<00:02:38.890> face<00:02:39.220> but<00:02:39.520> you<00:02:39.700> obviously<00:02:39.850> use

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
used on your face but you obviously use

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.810 
used on your face but you obviously use
it<00:02:40.540> on<00:02:40.630> your<00:02:40.780> lips<00:02:40.930> does<00:02:41.410> you<00:02:41.740> apply<00:02:42.340> these<00:02:42.400> I

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:42.820 
it on your lips does you apply these I

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:44.760 
it on your lips does you apply these I
actually<00:02:43.090> used<00:02:43.600> a<00:02:43.810> lip<00:02:44.050> brush<00:02:44.230> I<00:02:44.530> would

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:44.770 
actually used a lip brush I would

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:46.200 
actually used a lip brush I would
recommend<00:02:45.160> a<00:02:45.430> lip<00:02:45.580> brush<00:02:45.700> because<00:02:45.940> they're

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:46.210 
recommend a lip brush because they're

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:47.670 
recommend a lip brush because they're
like<00:02:46.450> paint<00:02:46.840> they<00:02:47.050> literally<00:02:47.320> look<00:02:47.650> like

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:47.680 
like paint they literally look like

00:02:47.680 --> 00:03:03.680 
like paint they literally look like
paint<00:02:48.130> and<00:02:48.310> they<00:02:48.790> come<00:02:48.970> out<00:02:49.090> like<00:02:49.270> paint

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:03.690 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:06.450 

so<00:03:04.690> the<00:03:04.810> next<00:03:04.960> color<00:03:05.200> is<00:03:05.380> koi<00:03:05.680> which<00:03:05.980> is<00:03:06.130> like<00:03:06.280> a
