 sports in the object model the 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:53.670
 paisatge 0 3 b 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.260
 we have bluetooth 4.0 other 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.090
 we found a microusb port for 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:59.100
 can charge a 120 battery 

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.829
 milliamp charge time we go 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.469
 here are two hours of loading we are going to 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:07.380
 allow an autonomy of 6 hours and in 

00:01:04.469 --> 00:01:08.579
 stand by up to 200 hours will be 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.159
 compatible with all devices 

00:01:08.579 --> 00:01:13.649
 by bluetooth that is iphone samsung or 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:17.189

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:21.630
 we want that is super league 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:23.580
 and this is this model of obedience because what 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:25.470
 considers interesting to do here in the 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:26.790
 I'm going to show you and the little one 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.650
 unemployment that I wanted to show a little 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:31.140
 how they work that is here in the 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:35.370
 European market, they are much more 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:38.330
 expensive since I bought this model 

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:42.760
 to run on everything is very good 

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:45.130
 we will leave the box here and here 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:47.350
 which are blank 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.420
 They adapt very well to the ear too 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:50.770
 we can take calls and be able to talk 

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.720
 from here since we have a small 

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:56.710
 microphone and we have the buttons on 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.470
 move forward or backwards the 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:02.710
 song the power button the port 

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:05.319
 usb for recharging and also the 

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:07.780
 buttons to raise and lower the volume 

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:09.220
 at the other end a very nice design 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.170
 which is very well adapted that now 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.440
 we will see a little here we also have 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:15.510
 so on exit 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.770
 the usb cable to charge 

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:22.170
 logically and different adapters 

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:23.940
 logically to the size of the ear that 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.100
 let's have us 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:29.760
 we also have around here 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:32.550
 manuals in English that you should remember if 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:35.010
 in English to see how the 

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:37.110
 load times and how it turns on 

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.090
 especially that here we have a code 

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:41.550
 also r in Chinese then if we want 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.200
 download the application also that we 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:45.030
 will allow to see the battery that has 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.660
 at all times from our smartphone 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:50.240
 this little bluetooth headset for 

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.260
 match it and quite simply simply 

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:55.830
 we press the power button during 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:59.410
 about 5 seconds and it will light up a 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:01.819
 led blue and red 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:05.139
 we keep pressing 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:08.749
 and we already see here that it changes red blue 

00:03:05.139 --> 00:03:13.099
 then we go to the smartphone to adjustments to 

00:03:08.749 --> 00:03:15.110
 bluetooth and we see the sh 03 b le 

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:18.050
 we give to link 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:20.420
 and I would already be connected just 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:21.740
 you can hang us our smartphone on 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:25.040
 our arm with our having support 

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:27.350
 and adjusting the auricular device 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.319
 in our ear we play the song 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:32.160
 example that we were 

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:34.340
 is for example 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:38.370
 and logically 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:40.409
 Well, we will hear perfectly 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.330
 our song with our headphones 

00:03:40.409 --> 00:03:44.700
 wirelessly without cables or be 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:45.870
 that to run for running I was going to do 

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.580
 our sports activity without 

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:49.519
 need for cables as it is an option 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:51.900
 very valid also can allow us 

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:54.510
 adapt it perfectly to the size of 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:56.310
 our hearing and have up to 6 hours of 

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:58.560
 autonomy that I do not think anyone is 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:01.200
 running more than 6 hours and they are about 

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:03.299
 headphones very comfortable and very easy to 

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:07.019
 handle and carry and I tell you they are 

00:04:03.299 --> 00:04:09.450
 alone 17.5 grams a ridiculous weight and 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:11.430
 that stays very well adapted to the size 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:13.540
 of the ear and our of our 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:15.159
 sports activity in general 

00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:17.229
 and what happens when we have so many 

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:20.650
 items both from yesterday by house that be 

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:22.780
 an mp3 headphones the bracelet the 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:24.580
 power bank that we have no way to 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.979
 load them all at once because we have 

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:29.289
 the latter and you see loading the track 

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:31.300
 that is connected to the wall to charge 

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:33.600
 all the devices that we have 

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:36.400
 home because we want lately in day 

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:37.969
 very many and here we have five ports 

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:41.299
 usb 

00:04:37.969 --> 00:04:43.639
 will load us on the wall that was more 

00:04:41.299 --> 00:04:45.769
 fast in facing power neighborhoods 

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:48.019
 here we have the cable to connect it to 

00:04:45.769 --> 00:04:50.149
 the wall what will allow us a 

00:04:48.019 --> 00:04:52.719
 fully fast load we have five 

00:04:50.149 --> 00:04:56.059
 usb ports to be able to charge and has been 

00:04:52.719 --> 00:04:58.399
 the power bank the xiaomi bracelet 

00:04:56.059 --> 00:05:00.860
 we have the headphones the mp3 

00:04:58.399 --> 00:05:02.569
 any other usb device that 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:04.759
 we have many, you open all 

00:05:02.569 --> 00:05:07.849
 possibly connecting here each 

00:05:04.759 --> 00:05:09.110
 in his post with 50 40 watts he has 

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:09.769
 of power because it will take us out of 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:12.139
 fast ways 

00:05:09.769 --> 00:05:13.549
 all our gadgets that we have for 

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:15.679
 house we call here all the 

00:05:13.549 --> 00:05:17.599
 characteristics that this presents us 

00:05:15.679 --> 00:05:19.399
 small multi osb charging port 

00:05:17.599 --> 00:05:20.929
 rehabilitate as already here that is a 

00:05:19.399 --> 00:05:22.309
 very interesting article for all 

00:05:20.929 --> 00:05:24.860
 those who have many articles 

00:05:22.309 --> 00:05:27.079
 for home that we can not load all to 

00:05:24.860 --> 00:05:30.199
 the time then this is a great idea 

00:05:27.079 --> 00:05:32.809
 to be able to load each one and the one 

00:05:30.199 --> 00:05:35.149
 we have bridge brand here 

00:05:32.809 --> 00:05:38.539
 with or whatever it's called I do not know what brand it is 

00:05:35.149 --> 00:05:40.939
 the one that looks good and then 

00:05:38.539 --> 00:05:42.889
 below I leave the links in case you want 

00:05:40.939 --> 00:05:45.020
 buy them can be bought these two 

00:05:42.889 --> 00:05:47.210
 items together because I have so many 

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:50.990
 per house to load at a time that clear 

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:53.330
 USB ports are very scarce and that's why 

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:57.080
 this little girl buys this what she announces 

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:58.400
 also the manual and quick to say 

00:05:57.080 --> 00:06:01.009
 which is very simple to use simply 

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:03.620
 is connected to the wall then we are at the 

00:06:01.009 --> 00:06:05.780
 wall we plug in and we can give it 

00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:08.389
 charges with our usb cable to any 

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:11.000
 device using this multi v you see 

00:06:08.389 --> 00:06:13.490
 of fast charges I'm going to tell you 

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:16.030
 than to know the exact battery of 

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:18.860
 terminal we can download the application 

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:21.050
 from the qr code that is totally 

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:22.639
 in Chinese the already optical application of 

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:25.460
 new you will know how to use it I have not known 

00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:27.949
 use it and I will put here the part 

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:29.630
 higher the level of load it carries in 

00:06:27.949 --> 00:06:32.300
 any time that is an application 

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:34.069
 quite interesting just just 

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:36.080
 why to know the battery level 

00:06:34.069 --> 00:06:38.360
 that brings us to rim every moment because 

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:40.819
 the application itself is useless since it does not 

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:42.930
 we know nothing that is completely in 

00:06:40.819 --> 00:06:45.330
 Chinese and we will not understand anything 

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:46.860
 it's just a little point that 

00:06:45.330 --> 00:06:48.389
 I wanted to highlight about that application 

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:49.830
 because until it has reached the small 

00:06:48.389 --> 00:06:51.539
 video I just wanted to show you these 

00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:53.130
 small two gadgets that I bought that 

00:06:51.539 --> 00:06:55.020
 considered interesting is to do this 

00:06:53.130 --> 00:06:56.850
 small video only with headphones 

00:06:55.020 --> 00:06:58.259
 bluetooth that would be very adaptable 

00:06:56.850 --> 00:07:00.210
 well at the time of running fits very well 

00:06:58.259 --> 00:07:02.460
 to the ear and cancels the sound very well 

00:07:00.210 --> 00:07:04.590
 external thanks to these headphones and 

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:06.690
 they give us sound quality audio 

00:07:04.590 --> 00:07:08.789
 very very good in addition to being able to answer 

00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:10.680
 incoming calls we're 

00:07:08.789 --> 00:07:12.479
 receiving when we are running 

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:14.340
 any other activity through 

00:07:12.479 --> 00:07:15.690
 our microphone without needing 

00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:18.360
 stop 

00:07:15.690 --> 00:07:20.160
 to pick up the phone and other a very 

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:21.810
 good buy and I say very good quality 

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:24.150
 of sound is improvement has Spain in 

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:26.400
 about 50 or 60 dollars euros better said 

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:28.740
 Well, you're going to have some headphones 

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:30.120
 good and very good quality I think 

00:07:28.740 --> 00:07:32.160
 you have it available also in others 

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:33.389
 colors either black and chosen in color 

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:34.830
 white because I liked this more 

00:07:33.389 --> 00:07:38.009
 color but good you can choose each one 

00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:40.349
 the color that most interests you and the port 

00:07:38.009 --> 00:07:42.360
 multicarga usb simply for that reason 

00:07:40.349 --> 00:07:44.430
 the many devices that we have for 

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:46.229
 charge at home that many times 

00:07:44.430 --> 00:07:48.240
 we managed to expose them all at once 

00:07:46.229 --> 00:07:49.680
 Well, these are two purchases that I've 

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:51.780
 made so you can see 

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:54.150
 simply these two gadgets 

00:07:51.780 --> 00:07:55.830
 interesting if you liked the video 

00:07:54.150 --> 00:07:57.479
 you know leave me a like that is always 

00:07:55.830 --> 00:08:00.150
