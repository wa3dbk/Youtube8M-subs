00:00:05.810 --> 00:00:10.589
 Hi there, recently on the channel was a review 

00:00:08.579 --> 00:00:12.780
 on the phone you my hammer which you 

00:00:10.589 --> 00:00:14.820
 now see during the review I said 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:16.920
 what is the program of the root of joy which 

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:19.470
 allows you to quickly and easily change the firmware 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.689
 on the phone and now decided to make a video about 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.730
 tom how to do it all done in 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.949
 principle just the same with the phone and died 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:27.779
 zira and in all likelihood the future 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:30.029
 phone and people will support this 

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:32.670
 function first thing you need to download 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:33.150
 ruth john program link official 

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:35.130
 site 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:37.230
 umid where it is downloaded is in 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:40.230
 description follow the link 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.700
 click download button download this 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.610
 install the program 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.830
 and there is such an icon 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:48.840
 launching the program now we have written 

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:50.730
 connect the phone to the computer that we 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:52.620
 actually do as we see 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:56.040
 the program itself reports what we need 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:58.470
 make click ok and on the auto computer 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:00.570
 hits connect id from now on the phone 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:04.910
 and computer interfaced now 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.910
 we confirm all requests on the phone 

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:11.320
 ready I want to notice at the first 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:13.090
 connecting the program will install the drivers 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.040
 have to wait a little bit 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.930
 now click on the flash button 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:18.760
 the program reports that the firmware is not 

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:21.130
 found on our computer click 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:23.260
 the yes buttons button opens a window with 

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:24.910
 list of firmware at the moment 

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.530
 yummy firmware available 

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:28.930
 zero the moment you will 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:31.540
 watch the video most likely firmware for 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:33.310
 you my hammer will already be on the list then 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.420
 you just select the appropriate firmware and 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:36.430
 pressing the button gave 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:38.380
 that is, download at this stage for now 

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:41.620
 developers finish my program 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:43.210
 downloaded manually through the yumi wild form then 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:44.860
 there is an official site uni 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:47.110
 for this we have a button below 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:55.150
 choose firmware from your computer 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:57.190
 what I actually will do now 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:02:00.280
 In this case, the phone is installed 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:02.080
 naked android 4.4 and we will try 

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.660
 install miui firmware 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:06.430
 weight of the firmware itself 530 megabytes add 

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:08.200
 on my own it's worth charging the phone though 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:09.580
 would be 70 percent before the start 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.350
 firmware after we chose 

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:13.840
 firmware program offers us 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:16.480
 make a backup of the phone ie save 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.640
 all your personal data or click 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.030
 skip button and continue to the next 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.340
 stage 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.230
 I advise you to backup it never 

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:25.209
 does not hurt well and I to save time 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:29.260
 press the step button the process has begun 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:31.950
 firmware video most likely to come out 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.950
 accelerated process 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:24.260
 the program reports that the phone has switched 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.260
 auto flashing mode 

00:04:02.060 --> 00:04:09.989
 the will on the phone is firmware from new 

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:12.329
 that is similar to xiaomi and so friends I 

00:04:09.989 --> 00:04:14.129
 I paused the video 

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:15.120
 phone problem not unlocked 

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:16.979
 after firmware 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.479
 the reason was that there was no sim card 

00:04:16.979 --> 00:04:20.630
 if you have such a problem 

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:22.949
 insert a sim card and it will work 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:24.990
 now as we see we have firmware here 

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:27.000
 miui is exactly the same way you can 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:29.660
 install any available firmware for 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.660
 you my hammer 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:34.320
 if you have any questions 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.840
 ask in the comments or in the group 

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:40.490
 vkontakte link is in the description yes yes 

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:40.490
 perhaps all thanks to all bye
