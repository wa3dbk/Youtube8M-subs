00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:46.410 
around you freeze
so<00:01:44.770> bullying<00:01:45.220> can<00:01:45.460> stem<00:01:45.700> a<00:01:45.729> lot<00:01:45.940> of<00:01:46.000> times<00:01:46.240> from

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:46.420 
so bullying can stem a lot of times from

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:47.940 
so bullying can stem a lot of times from
home<00:01:46.630> life<00:01:46.840> and<00:01:47.110> I<00:01:47.380> think<00:01:47.440> the<00:01:47.650> difference

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:47.950 
home life and I think the difference

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:49.530 
home life and I think the difference
that<00:01:48.009> parents<00:01:48.460> can<00:01:48.610> make<00:01:48.640> at<00:01:48.909> home<00:01:48.940> would<00:01:49.509> be

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:49.540 
that parents can make at home would be

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.060 
that parents can make at home would be
just<00:01:49.869> simple<00:01:50.170> things<00:01:50.200> like<00:01:50.500> telling<00:01:50.920> their

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.070 
just simple things like telling their

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:52.830 
just simple things like telling their
kids<00:01:51.190> that<00:01:51.430> they<00:01:51.550> love<00:01:51.729> them<00:01:51.940> or<00:01:52.180> giving<00:01:52.750> them

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:52.840 
kids that they love them or giving them

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.779 
kids that they love them or giving them
a<00:01:52.930> hug<00:01:53.110> before<00:01:53.380> they<00:01:53.680> leave<00:01:53.979> for<00:01:54.280> school<00:01:54.430> and

00:01:54.779 --> 00:01:54.789 
a hug before they leave for school and

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:56.639 
a hug before they leave for school and
parents<00:01:55.600> are<00:01:55.720> the<00:01:55.810> number<00:01:56.020> one<00:01:56.170> role<00:01:56.350> models

00:01:56.639 --> 00:01:56.649 
parents are the number one role models

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:58.620 
parents are the number one role models
that<00:01:56.710> kids<00:01:56.979> look<00:01:57.130> up<00:01:57.310> to<00:01:57.520> and<00:01:57.759> they<00:01:58.149> aspire<00:01:58.450> to

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:58.630 
that kids look up to and they aspire to

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 
make a positive difference is to

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.139 
make a positive difference is to
actually<00:02:02.500> talk<00:02:02.710> about<00:02:02.740> depression<00:02:03.280> and<00:02:03.670> hope
