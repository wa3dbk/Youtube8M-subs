out I'm sure a lot of people will
probably<00:02:22.370> choose<00:02:22.760> the<00:02:22.910> need<00:02:23.090> to<00:02:23.180> the<00:02:23.300> nurse

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.060 
probably choose the need to the nurse
insists<00:02:23.900> the<00:02:23.990> favor<00:02:24.200> and<00:02:24.380> despite<00:02:24.680> plus<00:02:24.920> he

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.070

has<00:02:25.160> more<00:02:25.370> fans<00:02:25.580> and<00:02:25.820> everything<00:02:26.180> but<00:02:26.900> this<00:02:27.770> is

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:27.950 
has more fans and everything but this is

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:29.860 
has more fans and everything but this is
more<00:02:28.160> of<00:02:28.220> a<00:02:28.340> 50<00:02:28.610> 55<00:02:28.940> in<00:02:29.210> my<00:02:29.300> opinion<00:02:29.600> I<00:02:29.840> think

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
more of a 50 55 in my opinion I think

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:35.110 
more of a 50 55 in my opinion I think
the<00:02:30.410> knockout<00:02:30.980> can<00:02:31.220> go<00:02:31.370> either<00:02:31.550> way<00:02:32.950> if<00:02:34.000> I<00:02:35.000> have

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:35.120 
the knockout can go either way if I have

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:40.630 
the knockout can go either way if I have
to<00:02:35.300> choose<00:02:36.550> man<00:02:37.550> i<00:02:38.980> stomp<00:02:39.980> on<00:02:40.130> it<00:02:40.160> I<00:02:40.370> was

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
to choose man i stomp on it I was

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.130 
to choose man i stomp on it I was
thinking<00:02:40.910> about<00:02:40.940> it<00:02:41.150> and<00:02:41.420> I'm<00:02:41.780> pretty<00:02:41.960> sure

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:42.140 
thinking about it and I'm pretty sure

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:43.870 
thinking about it and I'm pretty sure
someone<00:02:42.320> will<00:02:42.500> get<00:02:42.590> knocked<00:02:42.830> out<00:02:42.980> but<00:02:43.670> if<00:02:43.790> I

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
someone will get knocked out but if I

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.000 
someone will get knocked out but if I
have<00:02:44.000> to<00:02:44.090> choose<00:02:44.120> I<00:02:44.450> guess<00:02:44.630> in<00:02:45.110> the<00:02:45.560> early

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
have to choose I guess in the early

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.630 
have to choose I guess in the early
rounds<00:02:46.040> I<00:02:46.760> would<00:02:47.510> go<00:02:47.720> with<00:02:48.250> with<00:02:49.250> Nikolas

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
rounds I would go with with Nikolas

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.870 
rounds I would go with with Nikolas
Walters<00:02:50.060> I<00:02:50.270> think<00:02:50.480> from<00:02:51.380> round<00:02:51.710> 12<00:02:52.610> round

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880 
Walters I think from round 12 round

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.450 
Walters I think from round 12 round
maybe<00:02:53.720> six<00:02:54.140> like<00:02:54.470> the<00:02:54.590> first<00:02:54.770> first<00:02:54.950> half<00:02:55.340> of

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:55.460 
maybe six like the first first half of

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:57.700 
maybe six like the first first half of
the<00:02:55.520> fight<00:02:55.730> I<00:02:55.940> think<00:02:56.450> you<00:02:56.540> Nikolas<00:02:57.320> waters

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:57.710 
the fight I think you Nikolas waters

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:59.140 
the fight I think you Nikolas waters
will<00:02:57.950> most<00:02:58.160> likely<00:02:58.430> have<00:02:58.700> that<00:02:58.880> bent

00:02:59.140 --> 00:02:59.150 
will most likely have that bent

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.540 
will most likely have that bent
advantage<00:02:59.840> of<00:03:00.050> knocking<00:03:00.800> out<00:03:00.890> nonito<00:03:01.250> Donaire

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:01.550 
advantage of knocking out nonito Donaire

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:03.700 
advantage of knocking out nonito Donaire
and<00:03:01.790> maybe<00:03:02.210> as<00:03:02.330> the<00:03:02.480> fight<00:03:02.690> goes<00:03:02.720> on<00:03:03.110> as<00:03:03.290> nonito

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:03.710 
and maybe as the fight goes on as nonito

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:05.940 
and maybe as the fight goes on as nonito
Donaire<00:03:04.010> at<00:03:04.130> jesse's<00:03:04.550> and<00:03:04.730> everything

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:05.950 
Donaire at jesse's and everything

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.230 
Donaire at jesse's and everything
because<00:03:06.950> he<00:03:06.980> needs<00:03:07.310> to<00:03:07.460> really<00:03:07.670> think<00:03:07.880> smart

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:08.240 
because he needs to really think smart

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:09.520 
because he needs to really think smart
in<00:03:08.330> this<00:03:08.450> fight<00:03:08.630> this<00:03:08.750> is<00:03:08.930> not<00:03:09.050> going<00:03:09.230> to<00:03:09.290> be<00:03:09.410> an
