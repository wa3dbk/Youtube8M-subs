00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
connected the mouse to the PC

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:45.540 
connected the mouse to the PC
we're<00:03:39.880> gonna<00:03:40.150> turn<00:03:40.750> it<00:03:41.080> on<00:03:43.950> when<00:03:44.950> I<00:03:45.040> turn<00:03:45.280> it<00:03:45.400> on

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
you can see that there's a lad here

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:56.040 
you can see that there's a lad here
indicating<00:03:49.660> that<00:03:49.690> it's<00:03:50.290> turned<00:03:50.740> on<00:03:50.950> and<00:03:55.050> once

00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:56.050 
indicating that it's turned on and once

00:03:56.050 --> 00:04:01.490

you<00:03:56.290> click<00:03:56.500> to<00:03:56.860> use<00:03:57.070> it<00:03:58.530> it<00:03:59.530> stops<00:03:59.860> blinking

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
you click to use it it stops blinking

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:06.870

so<00:04:02.500> to<00:04:02.920> Mouse<00:04:03.220> I<00:04:04.830> have<00:04:05.830> to<00:04:06.070> confess<00:04:06.459> that<00:04:06.520> it

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:06.880 
so to Mouse I have to confess that it

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:12.110 
so to Mouse I have to confess that it
feels<00:04:07.420> a<00:04:07.690> little<00:04:07.810> weird<00:04:10.380> at<00:04:11.380> the<00:04:11.560> beginning

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
feels a little weird at the beginning

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:17.460 
feels a little weird at the beginning
but<00:04:13.120> it's<00:04:13.390> very<00:04:13.660> comfortable<00:04:14.020> and<00:04:16.230> it<00:04:17.230> feels

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.470 
but it's very comfortable and it feels

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:23.360 
but it's very comfortable and it feels
very<00:04:17.829> cool<00:04:19.049> however<00:04:20.049> a<00:04:20.350> lot<00:04:20.650> of<00:04:20.680> the<00:04:20.859> precision

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
very cool however a lot of the precision

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:27.440 
very cool however a lot of the precision
well<00:04:24.370> since<00:04:24.850> you're<00:04:25.690> so<00:04:26.020> used<00:04:26.500> to<00:04:26.710> the<00:04:27.100> old

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:27.450 
well since you're so used to the old

well since you're so used to the old
Mouse's<00:04:28.450> medieval<00:04:28.930> decision<00:04:29.440> is<00:04:29.620> not<00:04:29.830> what

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:30.100 
Mouse's medieval decision is not what

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:33.720 
Mouse's medieval decision is not what
you<00:04:30.340> expect<00:04:30.400> at<00:04:31.120> first<00:04:31.410> but<00:04:32.410> maybe<00:04:33.340> it<00:04:33.520> comes

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:33.730 
you expect at first but maybe it comes

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:36.780 
you expect at first but maybe it comes
with<00:04:34.030> a<00:04:34.060> weighted<00:04:34.690> time<00:04:35.070> however<00:04:36.070> I<00:04:36.580> believe
