00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
that you add one diamond and then we

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.929 
that you add one diamond and then we
also<00:01:13.229> have<00:01:13.409> this<00:01:13.530> supercharged<00:01:14.010> one<00:01:14.220> you're

00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
also have this supercharged one you're

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:16.219 
also have this supercharged one you're
gonna<00:01:15.060> need<00:01:15.240> to<00:01:15.330> do<00:01:15.390> a<00:01:15.420> little<00:01:15.780> bit<00:01:15.869> more<00:01:16.020> work

on this one because you need another

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.560 
on this one because you need another
reactor<00:01:18.060> and<00:01:18.270> of<00:01:19.020> course<00:01:19.970> your<00:01:20.970> iron<00:01:21.270> ingots

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
reactor and of course your iron ingots

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.350 
reactor and of course your iron ingots
and<00:01:21.869> then<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.140> obsidian<00:01:22.619> and<00:01:22.770> then<00:01:22.979> the

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360 
and then the obsidian and then the

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.270 
and then the obsidian and then the
diamond<00:01:24.360> and<00:01:24.509> stuff<00:01:24.720> so<00:01:24.990> that's<00:01:25.830> he<00:01:26.040> get<00:01:26.189> the

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
diamond and stuff so that's he get the

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.600 
diamond and stuff so that's he get the
supercharged<00:01:26.670> one<00:01:26.909> it's<00:01:27.509> it's<00:01:27.930> pretty<00:01:28.229> easy

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:28.610 
supercharged one it's it's pretty easy

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:30.859 
supercharged one it's it's pretty easy
so<00:01:29.610> as<00:01:29.729> long<00:01:29.850> as<00:01:29.909> you<00:01:30.090> have<00:01:30.180> the<00:01:30.329> stuff<00:01:30.630> that's

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
near for it like the nether reactor and

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.520 
near for it like the nether reactor and
the<00:01:33.270> diamonds<00:01:33.780> and<00:01:33.840> stuff<00:01:34.079> like<00:01:34.170> that<00:01:34.380> you

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
the diamonds and stuff like that you

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.109 
the diamonds and stuff like that you
should<00:01:34.680> be<00:01:34.770> able<00:01:34.860> to<00:01:34.979> get<00:01:35.159> this<00:01:35.310> in<00:01:35.610> survival

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
should be able to get this in survival

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:36.440 
should be able to get this in survival
mode

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
mode

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.300 
mode
so<00:01:36.960> let's<00:01:37.200> just<00:01:37.380> go<00:01:37.560> ahead<00:01:37.590> and<00:01:37.920> go<00:01:38.040> right<00:01:38.280> into

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
so let's just go ahead and go right into

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.580 
so let's just go ahead and go right into
the<00:01:38.610> mod<00:01:38.790> so<00:01:39.540> you<00:01:39.600> just<00:01:39.810> put<00:01:40.049> it<00:01:40.140> on<00:01:40.229> your<00:01:40.380> hand

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
the mod so you just put it on your hand

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.770 
the mod so you just put it on your hand
just<00:01:41.070> like<00:01:41.159> this<00:01:41.430> I'm<00:01:42.210> not<00:01:42.329> sure<00:01:42.390> verts

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:42.780 
just like this I'm not sure verts

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:45.010 
just like this I'm not sure verts
supposed<00:01:43.200> to<00:01:43.320> break<00:01:43.500> anything<00:01:43.950> cuz<00:01:44.189> on<00:01:44.340> mine

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:45.020 
supposed to break anything cuz on mine

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.300 
supposed to break anything cuz on mine
it<00:01:46.020> doesn't<00:01:46.290> break<00:01:46.409> anything<00:01:46.619> you<00:01:47.070> can<00:01:47.189> see

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
it doesn't break anything you can see

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.010 
it doesn't break anything you can see
it's<00:01:47.460> not<00:01:47.610> breaking<00:01:47.939> anything<00:01:48.119> enter<00:01:48.840> my

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
it's not breaking anything enter my

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.730 
it's not breaking anything enter my
searches<00:01:49.320> at<00:01:49.439> hand

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
searches at hand

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.830 
searches at hand
it<00:01:50.009> breaks<00:01:50.250> it<00:01:50.490> so<00:01:50.759> I'm<00:01:51.270> not<00:01:51.450> sure<00:01:51.509> if<00:01:51.720> it's

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
it breaks it so I'm not sure if it's

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.389 
it breaks it so I'm not sure if it's
supposed<00:01:51.899> to<00:01:52.079> do<00:01:52.200> that<00:01:52.350> but<00:01:52.560> I'm<00:01:52.680> I<00:01:52.890> think<00:01:53.040> it

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
supposed to do that but I'm I think it

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.460 
supposed to do that but I'm I think it
is<00:01:53.520> but<00:01:53.700> I<00:01:53.759> don't<00:01:54.149> really<00:01:54.299> know<00:01:54.450> but<00:01:54.659> anyways<00:01:55.200> I

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
is but I don't really know but anyways I

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.330 
is but I don't really know but anyways I
put<00:01:55.860> it<00:01:55.950> on<00:01:56.540> I<00:01:57.890> really<00:01:58.890> don't<00:01:59.040> know<00:01:59.100> what<00:01:59.250> the

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
put it on I really don't know what the

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.010 
put it on I really don't know what the
difference<00:01:59.640> is<00:01:59.759> between<00:01:59.939> both<00:02:00.509> of<00:02:00.540> them<00:02:00.810> this

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
difference is between both of them this

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.200 
difference is between both of them this
is<00:02:01.110> supercharged<00:02:01.530> one<00:02:01.770> and<00:02:02.009> just<00:02:02.729> a<00:02:02.880> regular

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
is supercharged one and just a regular

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.880 
is supercharged one and just a regular
one<00:02:03.329> because<00:02:03.719> I<00:02:03.750> think<00:02:04.170> they<00:02:04.320> both<00:02:04.560> do<00:02:04.829> the

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
one because I think they both do the

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.859 
one because I think they both do the
same<00:02:04.979> but<00:02:05.520> the<00:02:05.700> only<00:02:05.850> difference<00:02:06.119> I<00:02:06.630> don't

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:06.869 
same but the only difference I don't

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.199 
same but the only difference I don't
know<00:02:06.930> if<00:02:07.020> it<00:02:07.079> is<00:02:07.200> me<00:02:07.409> or<00:02:07.619> if<00:02:07.829> it's<00:02:07.920> like<00:02:08.190> or<00:02:08.879> if

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
know if it is me or if it's like or if

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.869 
know if it is me or if it's like or if
it's<00:02:09.330> really<00:02:09.840> difference<00:02:10.259> is<00:02:10.560> the<00:02:11.400> push<00:02:11.670> back

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
it's really difference is the push back

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.140 
it's really difference is the push back
so<00:02:12.209> you<00:02:12.270> tap<00:02:12.599> to<00:02:12.629> push

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
so you tap to push

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.619 
so you tap to push
back<00:02:13.329> just<00:02:14.290> like<00:02:14.409> that<00:02:14.470> I<00:02:15.120> don't<00:02:16.120> know<00:02:16.299> if<00:02:16.420> this

00:02:16.619 --> 00:02:16.629 
back just like that I don't know if this

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:18.569 
back just like that I don't know if this
is<00:02:16.659> further<00:02:17.110> if<00:02:17.409> this<00:02:17.590> goes<00:02:17.890> further<00:02:18.189> or<00:02:18.549> I

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:18.579 
is further if this goes further or I

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:20.220 
is further if this goes further or I
don't<00:02:18.730> know<00:02:18.909> if<00:02:19.060> it's<00:02:19.180> the<00:02:19.269> same<00:02:19.599> it's<00:02:19.989> this

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
don't know if it's the same it's this

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:21.990 
don't know if it's the same it's this
one<00:02:20.470> I<00:02:20.680> don't<00:02:21.159> really<00:02:21.280> know<00:02:21.430> but<00:02:21.640> they<00:02:21.819> both

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:22.000

just like that and it goes flying just
like<00:02:42.430> that<00:02:42.609> so<00:02:42.790> it's<00:02:42.909> pretty<00:02:42.970> cool<00:02:43.359> pretty<00:02:43.569> fun

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:44.280 
like that so it's pretty cool pretty fun

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.240 
like that so it's pretty cool pretty fun
let's<00:02:45.280> do<00:02:45.430> this<00:02:45.579> one<00:02:46.230> just<00:02:47.230> like<00:02:47.409> that<00:02:47.739> don't

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
let's do this one just like that don't

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:50.399 
let's do this one just like that don't
see<00:02:48.519> a<00:02:48.549> difference<00:02:48.970> with<00:02:49.120> this<00:02:49.299> one<00:02:49.540> let<00:02:50.319> me

00:02:50.399 --> 00:02:50.409 
see a difference with this one let me

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:51.599 
see a difference with this one let me
see<00:02:50.500> what<00:02:50.620> happens<00:02:50.829> to<00:02:50.889> be<00:02:50.980> change

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:51.609 
see what happens to be change

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:54.240 
see what happens to be change
oh<00:02:51.639> it<00:02:52.420> just<00:02:52.450> lets<00:02:52.780> it<00:02:52.870> go<00:02:53.019> so<00:02:53.349> let<00:02:53.920> me<00:02:53.980> go<00:02:54.069> back

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
oh it just lets it go so let me go back

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:57.360 
oh it just lets it go so let me go back
to<00:02:54.310> this<00:02:54.579> one<00:02:55.260> let<00:02:56.260> me<00:02:56.290> tap<00:02:56.650> see<00:02:56.920> if<00:02:57.220> it<00:02:57.280> goes

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
to this one let me tap see if it goes

00:02:57.370 --> 00:02:59.250 
to this one let me tap see if it goes
further<00:02:57.609> oh<00:02:57.939> okay<00:02:58.359> so<00:02:58.420> I<00:02:58.599> guess<00:02:58.810> that's<00:02:59.079> what

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
further oh okay so I guess that's what

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:00.990 
further oh okay so I guess that's what
it<00:02:59.349> does<00:02:59.500> it<00:02:59.709> goes<00:02:59.829> further<00:03:00.159> it<00:03:00.489> launches<00:03:00.819> it

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
it does it goes further it launches it

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.660 
it does it goes further it launches it
further<00:03:01.269> I<00:03:01.620> guess<00:03:02.620> that's<00:03:02.920> the<00:03:03.069> difference<00:03:03.129> so

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
further I guess that's the difference so

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:05.759 
further I guess that's the difference so
let<00:03:03.790> me<00:03:03.879> do<00:03:03.970> this<00:03:04.090> one<00:03:04.150> again<00:03:04.389> I<00:03:04.689> don't<00:03:05.470> really

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:05.769 
let me do this one again I don't really

me<00:03:09.010> try<00:03:09.159> to<00:03:09.189> get<00:03:09.400> so<00:03:10.030> let's<00:03:10.180> launch<00:03:10.389> it<00:03:10.659> alright

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:11.109 
me try to get so let's launch it alright

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:12.509 
me try to get so let's launch it alright
so<00:03:11.379> when<00:03:11.680> all<00:03:11.799> the<00:03:11.889> way<00:03:12.010> over<00:03:12.129> there

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:12.519 
so when all the way over there

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:16.830 
so when all the way over there
and<00:03:12.790> let<00:03:13.120> me<00:03:13.180> do<00:03:13.329> this<00:03:13.510> guy<00:03:13.810> oh<00:03:15.689> yeah<00:03:16.689> it

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:16.840 
and let me do this guy oh yeah it

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.449 
and let me do this guy oh yeah it
doesn't<00:03:17.019> go<00:03:17.169> further<00:03:17.379> so<00:03:17.739> I<00:03:17.769> guess<00:03:18.069> well

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:18.459 
doesn't go further so I guess well

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:20.520 
doesn't go further so I guess well
that's<00:03:18.699> a<00:03:18.819> lot<00:03:19.030> so<00:03:19.690> I<00:03:19.720> guess<00:03:19.959> that<00:03:20.319> is<00:03:20.500> the

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
that's a lot so I guess that is the

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.580 
that's a lot so I guess that is the
difference<00:03:21.040> this<00:03:21.280> one<00:03:21.519> is<00:03:21.639> just<00:03:21.910> a<00:03:22.000> lot<00:03:22.180> more

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
difference this one is just a lot more

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.710 
difference this one is just a lot more
powerful<00:03:23.590> with<00:03:23.980> with<00:03:24.370> the<00:03:24.549> pushing<00:03:25.269> or<00:03:25.419> the

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
powerful with with the pushing or the

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.189 
powerful with with the pushing or the
launching<00:03:26.709> of<00:03:26.829> it<00:03:27.010> so<00:03:27.569> that<00:03:28.569> is<00:03:28.720> what<00:03:28.870> this<00:03:28.989> mod

00:03:29.189 --> 00:03:29.199 
launching of it so that is what this mod

00:03:29.199 --> 00:03:30.330 
launching of it so that is what this mod
does<00:03:29.230> it's<00:03:29.709> pretty<00:03:29.919> cool

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
does it's pretty cool

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.789 
does it's pretty cool
um<00:03:30.609> it<00:03:31.090> does<00:03:31.299> wait<00:03:31.629> hold<00:03:31.780> on<00:03:31.900> I<00:03:32.139> want<00:03:32.650> to<00:03:32.680> try

00:04:17.279 --> 00:04:17.289 
to see if it works on a different player

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:21.599 
to see if it works on a different player
if<00:04:17.739> a<00:04:17.859> player<00:04:18.070> joined<00:04:18.400> to<00:04:18.549> your<00:04:19.150> game<00:04:20.219> so<00:04:21.219> I'm

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:21.609 
if a player joined to your game so I'm

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:23.659 
if a player joined to your game so I'm
not<00:04:21.789> I'm<00:04:22.270> tapping<00:04:22.599> a<00:04:22.750> holding<00:04:23.080> but<00:04:23.260> nothing

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:23.669 
not I'm tapping a holding but nothing

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:25.850 
not I'm tapping a holding but nothing
nothing<00:04:24.669> is<00:04:25.029> happening

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
nothing is happening

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:28.879 
nothing is happening
so<00:04:26.520> I'm<00:04:26.639> not<00:04:26.759> really<00:04:26.970> sure<00:04:27.060> it<00:04:27.389> works<00:04:27.889> but

00:04:28.879 --> 00:04:28.889 
so I'm not really sure it works but

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:31.159 
so I'm not really sure it works but
overall<00:04:29.280> this<00:04:29.580> is<00:04:29.639> a<00:04:29.699> pretty<00:04:29.729> fun<00:04:30.120> mod<00:04:30.360> um<00:04:30.960> it

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:31.169 
overall this is a pretty fun mod um it

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:33.890 
overall this is a pretty fun mod um it
doesn't<00:04:31.470> work<00:04:31.650> on<00:04:31.919> other<00:04:32.789> people<00:04:33.180> not<00:04:33.569> even<00:04:33.720> a

00:04:33.890 --> 00:04:33.900 
doesn't work on other people not even a

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.320 
doesn't work on other people not even a
pushback<00:04:34.349> thing<00:04:34.650> but<00:04:35.060> other<00:04:36.060> than<00:04:36.270> that

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:36.330 
pushback thing but other than that

00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:38.420 
pushback thing but other than that
there's<00:04:37.169> a<00:04:37.229> pretty<00:04:37.379> fun<00:04:37.620> mod<00:04:37.830> to<00:04:38.039> play<00:04:38.219> around

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:38.430 
there's a pretty fun mod to play around

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:41.629 
there's a pretty fun mod to play around
with<00:04:38.639> on<00:04:39.569> the<00:04:39.719> other<00:04:39.840> screen<00:04:40.169> I<00:04:40.469> can't<00:04:41.370> see<00:04:41.610> a

00:04:41.629 --> 00:04:41.639 
with on the other screen I can't see a

00:04:41.639 --> 00:04:43.279 
with on the other screen I can't see a
player<00:04:41.939> like<00:04:42.389> there's<00:04:42.659> nobody<00:04:42.810> here

00:04:43.279 --> 00:04:43.289 
player like there's nobody here

00:04:43.289 --> 00:04:45.409 
player like there's nobody here
so<00:04:43.770> I<00:04:43.800> guess<00:04:44.280> that's<00:04:44.460> the<00:04:44.639> only<00:04:44.849> downside<00:04:45.060> to
