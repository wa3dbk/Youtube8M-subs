00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
at the controller there we go so I went

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.600 
at the controller there we go so I went
for<00:01:11.909> red<00:01:12.090> again<00:01:12.479> because<00:01:12.810> I've<00:01:12.960> seen<00:01:12.990> my<00:01:13.380> whole

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:13.610 
for red again because I've seen my whole

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.359

controllers red as well and went for the

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.060 
controllers red as well and went for the
stealth<00:01:21.420> buttons<00:01:21.900> here<00:01:22.229> so<00:01:22.530> you<00:01:22.590> can't<00:01:22.860> see

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
round the controller hopefully you can

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:13.530 
round the controller hopefully you can
see<00:02:12.370> that<00:02:12.550> I<00:02:12.580> don't<00:02:12.760> know<00:02:12.820> why<00:02:12.940> I<00:02:12.970> didn't<00:02:13.330> focus

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
see that I don't know why I didn't focus

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.270 
see that I don't know why I didn't focus
in<00:02:13.840> and<00:02:15.330> but<00:02:16.330> yeah<00:02:16.480> they're<00:02:16.690> a<00:02:16.720> lot<00:02:17.020> wider<00:02:17.890> at

to see how it feels I mean that the
finish<00:02:54.640> on<00:02:54.820> it<00:02:54.850> is<00:02:55.030> really<00:02:55.420> nice<00:02:55.570> it's<00:02:55.840> like<00:02:55.930> a

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:04.530 
well which is nice black and red and see
I<00:03:03.220> think<00:03:03.610> that's<00:03:03.760> everything<00:03:04.090> obviously

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:04.540 
I think that's everything obviously

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.600 
I think that's everything obviously
touchpad<00:03:05.380> works<00:03:05.860> exactly<00:03:06.190> the<00:03:06.370> same<00:03:06.430> the

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:06.610 
touchpad works exactly the same the

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.270 
touchpad works exactly the same the
light<00:03:06.940> bar<00:03:07.209> is<00:03:07.390> still<00:03:07.630> there<00:03:07.840> and<00:03:08.280> still

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:09.280 
light bar is still there and still

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:11.760 
light bar is still there and still

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:11.770 
charged up the same way and of think you

00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:13.770 
charged up the same way and of think you
can<00:03:11.920> customize<00:03:12.489> the<00:03:12.730> sticks<00:03:13.030> you<00:03:13.570> can<00:03:13.690> have

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
can customize the sticks you can have

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.110 
can customize the sticks you can have
downed<00:03:14.049> ones<00:03:14.380> white<00:03:14.830> ones<00:03:14.860> longer<00:03:15.640> ones<00:03:15.880> I

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:16.120 
downed ones white ones longer ones I
