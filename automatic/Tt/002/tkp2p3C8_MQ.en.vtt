 just a little bit always comes clichÃ© 

00:00:15.699 --> 00:00:17.810
 year in year out it's not hard 

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:22.099
 but perhaps hard through curves liessel and there are to where so 

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:25.980
 economical to drive that we do in the golf gtd that outsiders 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.619

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:33.050
 for a little faster driving 

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:35.680
 yes and then it is only you 

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:38.680
 to put as beautiful tracks as possible 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.450

 complete mans stop system and two fuel tank side fuel lines 

00:01:06.819 --> 00:01:10.169
 one with normal 98 and the other with bp ultimate 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.840
 yes, three cylinders that rotate can be seen on a normal second cousin and three on them 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.190
 BP and you can clearly see the effect on the screen 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:23.500
 of these is, for example, the carbon deposit 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:26.230
 busy to win 

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:28.380

 the battle of arnhem 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.990
 but on 

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.219
 but they did not reach themselves on Sunday evening 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:56.210
 service Friday 

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:59.210
 the torque one higher 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.570
 cycling come 

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.630
 No 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.630
 23 percent 

00:02:20.179 --> 00:02:23.179
 because of which it is difficult 

00:02:25.399 --> 00:02:28.759

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.379
 kilometers per liter measuring number two 

00:02:47.379 --> 00:02:50.879
