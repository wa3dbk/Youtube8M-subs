00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:33.870 
12 to 24 hours we could divide this

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:36.620 
12 to 24 hours we could divide this
dough<00:04:33.930> up<00:04:34.350> and<00:04:34.680> put<00:04:35.010> it<00:04:35.100> into<00:04:35.370> smaller<00:04:35.940> well

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:41.610 
floured bowls to make rolls now we've

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:44.060 
floured bowls to make rolls now we've
prepared<00:04:42.030> this<00:04:42.450> batch<00:04:42.750> ahead<00:04:43.380> time<00:04:43.590> and<00:04:43.950> it's

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:44.070 
prepared this batch ahead time and it's

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:46.580 
prepared this batch ahead time and it's
been<00:04:44.220> rising<00:04:44.490> about<00:04:45.000> 18<00:04:45.720> hours<00:04:45.900> it's<00:04:46.440> got<00:04:46.560> a

00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:49.800 
very nice spongy texture so it looks

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.140 
very nice spongy texture so it looks
like<00:04:49.860> it's<00:04:50.070> time<00:04:50.280> to<00:04:50.310> start<00:04:50.580> preheating<00:04:50.820> our
