00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:19.240

 the golden master comes out good 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:31.240
 before you start you need to have your edit 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.580
 registered in developer mode I've 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:36.820
 seen on the internet that you can buy them 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:38.860
 from a dollar to 10 dollars I have seen 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:40.450
 quite high prices but good and 

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:42.610
 it's something that you see also what you can 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:44.500
 register or you can update without being 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:47.050
 developer nothing else you're going to have 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:49.030

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.560

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.620
 take advantage and try in case you do not 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:01:00.190

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:01.690

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:05.379

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:07.930
 up to a dollar sales but good 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:09.430

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.320

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.300
 I want to do for the fact of the videos 

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:15.940
 of the tweets because 

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:18.220
 ios 8 is going to be unstable remember is the 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:20.230
 first beta they are taking out so 

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:23.350
 well let's go super fast in case 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:25.660
 do not have the registered edit that is not 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.550
 registered your iphone or ipod touch or your 

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:29.890
 ipad the only thing we have to do is 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:32.410
 press shift in case of windows or 

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:35.020
 apple in case of marc and give it in the 

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:38.380

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:40.660

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:45.040

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.020

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:52.120
 Saleh but in case you have your 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.580
 Registered dale in restore is the best 

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:57.010
 and it's what I always recommend 

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:59.410
 give it in restore since it's going to be a 

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:01.210
 clean update and you're going to lose everything 

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:03.760
 what you have above santervÃ¡s to lose 

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:07.060
 photos you're going to lose videos you're going to lose 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:09.010

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.650
 in your case of videos and photos of making a 

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:13.150
 backup in case of notes and everything 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.340

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:13.459
 we wait for the language to change 

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:15.830
 remember I repeat you again I'll 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:17.600
 I recommend that you have registered your cv 

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:19.880
 dir as a developer so you do not 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:22.160
 have no problem when it comes to 

00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:24.889
 want to update the other betas and 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:27.800
 you can restore in a clean way and 

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:31.100
 without errors that I also repeat to you 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:35.090
 been reading that there are many problems 

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:36.950
 regarding the update in case of 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:38.720
 it is not java developer when 

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:41.330
 all this because I changed the password and 

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:43.340

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:46.600

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:58.500

00:04:56.159 --> 00:05:02.520

00:05:25.439 --> 00:05:30.139
 everything that this new system brings 

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:30.139
 operating apple 

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:34.070
 because until now he did not want to install 

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:37.190
 on the iphone I'm going to repeat you 

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:41.470
 issues already very mine last time what 

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:43.340
 install the bird betas 7 was because 

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:45.830
 completely changed the system 

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:49.040
 operative I do not know I liked it quite like 

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:51.350

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:53.420

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:55.700
