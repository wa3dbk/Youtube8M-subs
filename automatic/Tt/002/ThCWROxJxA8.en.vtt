00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
hand and stretching the dough out you'll

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.190 
hand and stretching the dough out you'll
feel<00:01:23.100> that<00:01:23.310> a<00:01:23.340> slightly<00:01:23.970> gritty<00:01:24.330> texture<00:01:24.930> to

feel that a slightly gritty texture to

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.380 
feel that a slightly gritty texture to
the<00:01:25.290> dough<00:01:25.470> initially<00:01:26.310> but<00:01:26.640> as<00:01:26.790> you<00:01:26.939> knead<00:01:27.180> the

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:27.390 
the dough initially but as you knead the

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.390 
the dough initially but as you knead the
dough<00:01:27.420> after<00:01:27.869> about<00:01:28.380> 4<00:01:28.680> 5<00:01:28.890> or<00:01:29.100> 10<00:01:29.280> minutes

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
dough after about 4 5 or 10 minutes

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.870 
dough after about 4 5 or 10 minutes
you'll<00:01:29.970> get<00:01:30.119> a<00:01:30.180> lovely<00:01:30.420> smooth<00:01:30.840> silky<00:01:31.470> feel

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.640 
you'll get a lovely smooth silky feel
now<00:01:32.880> if<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.119> dough<00:01:33.270> ends<00:01:33.450> up<00:01:33.600> too<00:01:34.140> sticky<00:01:34.409> we

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
now if the dough ends up too sticky we

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.010 
now if the dough ends up too sticky we
can<00:01:34.770> just<00:01:34.950> add<00:01:35.130> a<00:01:35.189> little<00:01:35.400> flour<00:01:35.970> to<00:01:36.270> our<00:01:36.600> hands

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
can just add a little flour to our hands

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.109 
can just add a little flour to our hands
into<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.409> dough<00:01:37.590> and<00:01:37.799> continue<00:01:38.520> to<00:01:38.670> mix<00:01:38.880> that

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
into the dough and continue to mix that

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.510 
into the dough and continue to mix that
through<00:01:39.329> we<00:01:39.869> want<00:01:39.990> a<00:01:40.110> smooth<00:01:40.500> silky<00:01:41.369> dough

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
through we want a smooth silky dough

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:46.600 
through we want a smooth silky dough
that's<00:01:41.820> not<00:01:42.119> too<00:01:42.840> sticky<00:01:43.110> but<00:01:43.680> not<00:01:43.890> too<00:01:44.100> firm

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.090 

so<00:01:47.540> now<00:01:47.690> our<00:01:47.720> dough<00:01:48.020> started<00:01:48.500> to<00:01:48.560> become<00:01:48.830> nice

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
so now our dough started to become nice

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.890 
so now our dough started to become nice
