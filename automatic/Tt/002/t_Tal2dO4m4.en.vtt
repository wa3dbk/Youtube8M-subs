the<00:02:19.709> pressure<00:02:19.890> missile<00:02:20.220> shard

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:21.819 
the pressure missile shard

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:24.869 
the pressure missile shard
and<00:02:22.709> yeah<00:02:23.709> you<00:02:23.799> speed<00:02:24.129> it<00:02:24.249> up<00:02:24.340> and<00:02:24.549> get<00:02:24.790> some

00:02:24.869 --> 00:02:24.879 
and yeah you speed it up and get some

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:27.809 
and yeah you speed it up and get some
kills<00:02:25.090> so<00:02:25.450> yeah<00:02:26.290> I<00:02:26.590> got<00:02:27.189> nice<00:02:27.400> double<00:02:27.670> kill

you're<00:02:31.209> out<00:02:31.359> killing<00:02:32.349> some<00:02:32.790> stupid<00:02:33.790> retards

00:02:34.259 --> 00:02:34.269 
you're out killing some stupid retards

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:38.970 
you're out killing some stupid retards
it's<00:02:34.420> run<00:02:34.659> around<00:02:36.480> and<00:02:37.480> yeah<00:02:38.379> we<00:02:38.709> like<00:02:38.859> this

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
it's run around and yeah we like this

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.309 
it's run around and yeah we like this
killstreak<00:02:39.400> set<00:02:39.579> up<00:02:39.719> this<00:02:40.719> seems<00:02:40.989> most

00:02:41.309 --> 00:02:41.319 
killstreak set up this seems most

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:43.349 
killstreak set up this seems most
paintable<00:02:41.650> for<00:02:41.920> me<00:02:42.209> because<00:02:43.209> they're

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:43.359 
paintable for me because they're

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:45.720 
paintable for me because they're
predator<00:02:43.689> missile<00:02:43.989> to<00:02:44.139> Harrier<00:02:44.560> to<00:02:44.920> a<00:02:44.950> c-130

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
predator missile to Harrier to a c-130

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.149 
predator missile to Harrier to a c-130
or<00:02:45.909> chopper<00:02:46.209> gunner<00:02:46.680> really<00:02:47.680> complements

00:02:48.149 --> 00:02:48.159 
or chopper gunner really complements

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:50.309 
or chopper gunner really complements
each<00:02:48.310> other<00:02:48.639> like<00:02:49.030> it<00:02:49.359> really<00:02:49.689> like<00:02:50.019> once<00:02:50.230> you

each other like it really like once you

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:51.569 
each other like it really like once you
once<00:02:50.500> you<00:02:50.560> get<00:02:50.709> to<00:02:50.739> the<00:02:50.859> five<00:02:51.010> feels<00:02:51.280> like

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:51.579 
once you get to the five feels like

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:53.129 
once you get to the five feels like
you're<00:02:51.760> good<00:02:51.879> to<00:02:51.999> go<00:02:52.030> unless<00:02:52.749> you're<00:02:52.900> really

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:53.139

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
know what they are javelins that doesn't

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:21.470 
know what they are javelins that doesn't
look<00:03:20.220> like<00:03:20.310> a<00:03:20.400> javelin<00:03:20.730> they<00:03:21.210> can<00:03:21.330> I<00:03:21.360> could

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
look like a javelin they can I could

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.510 
look like a javelin they can I could
tell<00:03:21.600> what<00:03:21.750> that<00:03:21.780> was<00:03:22.080> then<00:03:22.470> you<00:03:22.800> can<00:03:22.950> tell<00:03:23.490> me

below<00:03:24.180> in<00:03:24.510> the<00:03:24.570> comments<00:03:24.990> I<00:03:25.740> don't<00:03:26.190> use

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
below in the comments I don't use

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:28.730 
below in the comments I don't use
missiles<00:03:26.790> I<00:03:27.000> like<00:03:27.330> I<00:03:27.570> think<00:03:27.990> i'm<00:03:28.080> using<00:03:28.650> the

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:28.740 
missiles I like I think i'm using the

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:33.110 
missiles I like I think i'm using the
javelin<00:03:29.190> like<00:03:29.400> three<00:03:29.820> times<00:03:30.060> and<00:03:30.450> i<00:03:32.120> think

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
javelin like three times and i think

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.820 
javelin like three times and i think
that<00:03:33.240> was<00:03:33.330> because<00:03:33.360> I<00:03:33.900> wanted<00:03:34.080> to<00:03:34.320> see<00:03:34.680> the

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:34.830 
that was because I wanted to see the

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:36.020 
that was because I wanted to see the
javelin<00:03:35.340> glitch<00:03:35.370> thing<00:03:35.760> that<00:03:35.850> they<00:03:35.940> were

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:36.030 
javelin glitch thing that they were

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:38.780 
javelin glitch thing that they were
talking<00:03:36.180> about<00:03:36.360> and<00:03:36.950> I<00:03:37.950> immediately<00:03:38.430> gave

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:38.790 
talking about and I immediately gave

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.040 
talking about and I immediately gave
that<00:03:38.970> up<00:03:39.000> because<00:03:39.210> I<00:03:39.480> just<00:03:39.540> thought<00:03:39.810> that<00:03:39.870> was

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:40.050 
that up because I just thought that was

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:42.170 
that up because I just thought that was
stupid<00:03:40.560> like<00:03:40.830> I'm<00:03:40.980> glad<00:03:41.220> into<00:03:41.460> bed<00:03:41.640> out<00:03:41.820> like

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:42.180

stupid like I'm glad into bed out like
the<00:03:42.360> javelin<00:03:42.780> glitch<00:03:42.810> was<00:03:43.170> just<00:03:43.350> unbelievably

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
the javelin glitch was just unbelievably

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.310 
the javelin glitch was just unbelievably
retarded<00:03:44.790> can't<00:03:45.090> believe<00:03:45.270> they<00:03:45.420> have<00:03:45.810> to

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:57.810 
God because the holographic sight is

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:58.910 
God because the holographic sight is
weird<00:03:58.050> I'm<00:03:58.290> not<00:03:58.440> really<00:03:58.590> much<00:03:58.770> of<00:03:58.830> a

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:01.200 
holographic sight kind of guy it seems

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:04.280 
holographic sight kind of guy it seems
to<00:04:01.290> be<00:04:01.410> more<00:04:01.680> of<00:04:01.740> a<00:04:02.030> long-range<00:04:03.050> aim<00:04:04.050> down<00:04:04.230> the

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
to be more of a long-range aim down the

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:07.220 
to be more of a long-range aim down the
sights<00:04:04.410> kind<00:04:04.830> of<00:04:04.890> thing<00:04:05.510> I'm<00:04:06.510> more<00:04:07.020> of<00:04:07.110> a

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
sights kind of thing I'm more of a

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:10.790 
sights kind of thing I'm more of a
close-range<00:04:08.100> rusher<00:04:08.610> kind<00:04:08.910> of<00:04:08.970> guy<00:04:09.090> so<00:04:09.800> you

close-range rusher kind of guy so you

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:14.330 
close-range rusher kind of guy so you
think<00:04:11.160> this<00:04:11.459> wasn't<00:04:11.850> really<00:04:12.330> my<00:04:12.480> forte<00:04:13.340> now

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:14.340 
think this wasn't really my forte now

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:15.949 
think this wasn't really my forte now
usually<00:04:14.490> like<00:04:14.700> the<00:04:14.760> red<00:04:14.940> thought<00:04:15.120> my<00:04:15.600> opinion

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
usually like the red thought my opinion

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:18.650 
usually like the red thought my opinion
that's<00:04:16.250> one<00:04:17.250> of<00:04:17.310> my<00:04:17.400> flavor<00:04:17.700> you<00:04:18.450> know<00:04:18.540> what<00:04:18.630> I

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:18.660 
that's one of my flavor you know what I

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:20.140 
that's one of my flavor you know what I
mean

00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:20.150 
mean

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:23.100 
mean
yeah<00:04:20.630> eating<00:04:20.989> or<00:04:21.199> cysts<00:04:21.620> and

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:23.110 
yeah eating or cysts and

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:25.670 
yeah eating or cysts and
I<00:04:23.169> like<00:04:24.039> they<00:04:24.159> see<00:04:24.219> are<00:04:24.490> actually<00:04:24.639> I<00:04:24.879> mean<00:04:25.030> it's

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 
I like they see are actually I mean it's

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:30.209 
I like they see are actually I mean it's
not<00:04:26.680> what<00:04:27.099> I'm<00:04:27.340> best<00:04:27.580> at<00:04:27.849> because<00:04:28.360> uh<00:04:28.389> you<00:04:29.219> know

00:04:30.209 --> 00:04:30.219 
not what I'm best at because uh you know

00:04:30.219 --> 00:04:31.740 
not what I'm best at because uh you know
it's<00:04:30.400> it's<00:04:30.610> got<00:04:30.819> weak<00:04:31.000> bullets<00:04:31.360> but<00:04:31.479> it's<00:04:31.629> very

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:31.750 
it's it's got weak bullets but it's very

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:34.439 
it's it's got weak bullets but it's very
accurate<00:04:32.669> so<00:04:33.669> you<00:04:33.729> gotta<00:04:33.849> get<00:04:34.000> balls<00:04:34.180> count

00:04:34.439 --> 00:04:34.449 
accurate so you gotta get balls count

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:36.929 
accurate so you gotta get balls count
and<00:04:34.990> I<00:04:35.889> guess<00:04:36.129> I'm<00:04:36.250> not<00:04:36.340> really<00:04:36.460> good<00:04:36.610> at<00:04:36.669> doing

00:04:36.929 --> 00:04:36.939 
and I guess I'm not really good at doing

00:04:36.939 --> 00:04:38.610 
and I guess I'm not really good at doing
that<00:04:37.030> I<00:04:37.090> mean<00:04:37.270> it<00:04:37.900> really<00:04:37.990> depend<00:04:38.319> on<00:04:38.379> the<00:04:38.439> gun

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:38.620 
that I mean it really depend on the gun

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:43.649 
that I mean it really depend on the gun

really like this map scrap yard is
really<00:04:46.990> fun<00:04:47.110> map<00:04:47.319> for<00:04:47.500> me<00:04:47.590> I<00:04:48.930> can<00:04:49.930> kind<00:04:50.110> of

00:04:50.129 --> 00:04:50.139 
really fun map for me I can kind of

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:53.550 
really fun map for me I can kind of
compare<00:04:50.319> two<00:04:50.650> vacant<00:04:51.129> from<00:04:51.280> quality<00:04:51.639> for<00:04:52.560> the

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:53.560 
compare two vacant from quality for the

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.890 
compare two vacant from quality for the
fact<00:04:53.800> that<00:04:53.889> it's<00:04:54.099> you<00:04:54.280> know<00:04:54.310> close<00:04:55.000> range<00:04:55.300> and

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:55.900 
fact that it's you know close range and

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:57.510 
fact that it's you know close range and
it's<00:04:56.379> a<00:04:56.469> lot<00:04:56.590> of<00:04:56.680> running<00:04:56.889> around<00:04:56.949> eight<00:04:57.310> to<00:04:57.400> do
