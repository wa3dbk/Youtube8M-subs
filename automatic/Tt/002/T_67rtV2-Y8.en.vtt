00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:48.509 
saying that this is cheating well in a
way<00:02:43.600> it<00:02:43.630> is<00:02:44.319> I<00:02:44.739> mean<00:02:46.080> but<00:02:47.080> in<00:02:47.560> reality<00:02:47.950> it's

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:48.519 
way it is I mean but in reality it's

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:51.420 
way it is I mean but in reality it's
just<00:02:48.579> like<00:02:48.910> ever<00:02:49.120> no<00:02:49.299> well<00:02:50.079> coordinated<00:02:51.040> to

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:51.430 
just like ever no well coordinated to

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.030 
just like ever no well coordinated to
mantain<00:02:51.940> it's<00:02:52.630> like<00:02:52.870> any<00:02:53.170> well<00:02:53.500> coordinated

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.040 
mantain it's like any well coordinated

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.020 
mantain it's like any well coordinated
to<00:02:54.370> maintain<00:02:55.620> but<00:02:56.620> it's<00:02:57.190> just<00:02:57.430> done<00:02:57.610> with<00:02:57.790> one

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:58.030 
to maintain but it's just done with one

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.560 
to maintain but it's just done with one
person

00:02:58.560 --> 00:02:58.570 
person

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:02.340 
person
I<00:02:59.280> personally<00:03:00.390> don't<00:03:01.390> count<00:03:02.019> this<00:03:02.170> as

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:02.350 
I personally don't count this as

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:04.880 
I personally don't count this as
cheating<00:03:02.739> at<00:03:02.859> all<00:03:03.040> I<00:03:03.310> just<00:03:03.370> think<00:03:03.850> it's<00:03:04.060> a

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:04.890 
cheating at all I just think it's a

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.830 
cheating at all I just think it's a
clever<00:03:05.890> and<00:03:06.280> different<00:03:06.970> way<00:03:07.150> to<00:03:07.209> play<00:03:07.570> with

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:07.840 
clever and different way to play with

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.330 
clever and different way to play with
the<00:03:07.930> world<00:03:08.109> of<00:03:08.230> warcraft<00:03:08.440> and<00:03:09.220> I<00:03:09.880> really<00:03:10.570> enjoy

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340

I've<00:03:29.109> got<00:03:29.170> two<00:03:29.739> wolves<00:03:29.980> in<00:03:30.250> this<00:03:30.430> video<00:03:30.760> but

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:31.120 
I've got two wolves in this video but

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:32.610 
I've got two wolves in this video but
that's<00:03:31.269> mainly<00:03:31.600> because<00:03:31.720> I'm<00:03:32.019> at<00:03:32.170> sea<00:03:32.320> level

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:32.620 
that's mainly because I'm at sea level

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:35.160 
that's mainly because I'm at sea level
in<00:03:32.859> the<00:03:32.890> wolf<00:03:33.250> so<00:03:33.880> I<00:03:33.940> can<00:03:34.120> use<00:03:34.299> them

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:35.170 
in the wolf so I can use them

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:38.220 
in the wolf so I can use them
in<00:03:35.350> instances<00:03:36.250> I've<00:03:36.670> got<00:03:37.000> mainly<00:03:37.720> used<00:03:37.960> to

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:38.230 
in instances I've got mainly used to

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:42.449 
in instances I've got mainly used to
bears<00:03:38.560> for<00:03:38.950> level<00:03:39.190> in<00:03:39.390> there<00:03:40.390> obviously<00:03:41.459> got

00:03:42.449 --> 00:03:42.459 
bears for level in there obviously got

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:46.890 
bears for level in there obviously got
the<00:03:42.580> tenth<00:03:42.850> time<00:03:43.300> trees<00:03:43.750> in<00:03:44.520> pet<00:03:45.600> builds<00:03:46.600> and

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
the tenth time trees in pet builds and

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:51.630 
the tenth time trees in pet builds and
it<00:03:47.850> makes<00:03:48.959> selling<00:03:49.959> things<00:03:50.470> so<00:03:50.980> easy

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:51.640 
it makes selling things so easy

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:55.080 
it makes selling things so easy

questions and stuff but just live with
it<00:04:43.180> really<00:04:43.570> I<00:04:46.710> hopefully<00:04:47.710> when<00:04:48.130> I<00:04:48.220> get<00:04:48.370> to<00:04:48.460> 80

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:48.640 
it really I hopefully when I get to 80

00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:52.260 
it really I hopefully when I get to 80
or<00:04:48.820> try<00:04:49.210> and<00:04:49.330> do<00:04:49.419> some<00:04:49.630> heroics<00:04:50.669> raiding<00:04:51.669> is<00:04:52.120> a

bit<00:04:52.660> of<00:04:52.750> the<00:04:52.960> question<00:04:53.440> because<00:04:54.720> it's<00:04:55.720> pretty

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:55.930 
bit of the question because it's pretty

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:59.190 
bit of the question because it's pretty
difficult<00:04:56.290> to<00:04:56.680> jewel-box<00:04:57.340> like<00:04:58.120> when<00:04:59.080> you

00:04:59.190 --> 00:04:59.200 
difficult to jewel-box like when you

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:00.780 
difficult to jewel-box like when you
gotta<00:04:59.380> like<00:04:59.590> fight<00:04:59.860> so<00:05:00.040> we<00:05:00.190> need<00:05:00.340> to<00:05:00.460> spread

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:00.790 
gotta like fight so we need to spread

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:08.150 
gotta like fight so we need to spread
out<00:05:00.850> a<00:05:01.000> lot<00:05:01.270> it's<00:05:01.830> it's<00:05:02.830> doable<00:05:05.490> it's

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:08.160 
out a lot it's it's doable it's

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:09.960 
out a lot it's it's doable it's
difficult

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:09.970 
difficult

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:12.570 
difficult
also<00:05:10.780> if<00:05:10.930> you<00:05:11.050> can<00:05:11.170> think<00:05:11.380> of<00:05:11.620> any<00:05:11.770> suggestions

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:12.580 
also if you can think of any suggestions

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:14.310 
also if you can think of any suggestions
which<00:05:12.910> I<00:05:13.090> could<00:05:13.270> what<00:05:13.630> I<00:05:13.660> could<00:05:13.900> do<00:05:14.050> with<00:05:14.170> these

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:14.320 
which I could what I could do with these

00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:17.280 
which I could what I could do with these
two<00:05:14.560> characters<00:05:15.070> as<00:05:15.400> well<00:05:15.430> then<00:05:16.180> I'll<00:05:16.750> be
