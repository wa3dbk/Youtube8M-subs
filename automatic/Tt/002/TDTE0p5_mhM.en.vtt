00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:10.850
 hop 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:15.770
 and greet everyone we find ourselves 

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:18.650
 for a new exclusivity on gt5 

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:20.570
 online in 1 26 after the recent patch 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:22.610
 so this is a new publication 

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:24.560
 to do this so you will need to 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:25.760
 two minimum dams you will put 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.340
 take it early in a garage 

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:29.869
 we do not care there is a plane still needed 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:31.789
 just that they have the slope in what 

00:00:29.869 --> 00:00:34.670
 you preferably you go to m 

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:35.720
 everything in front of right is just 

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.250
 right when you get back into the 

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.379
 garage preferably so that long live 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.059
 faster to do so we need a 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:43.100
 garage that are filled with vehicles 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:44.330
 like this one we can fill it with 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.559
 leguide com you see there I have no 

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:46.790
 vehicle but that's because I was coming 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:48.409
 to order it on current which he 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.120
 did not appear once you 

00:00:48.409 --> 00:00:51.019
 replace with a rebel guy but he 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.610
 You just have one of the few that are 

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:54.680
 full and the slope at you have brought it 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:56.350
 in another garage as much as possible 

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.729
 forward to come be faster 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:00.559
 so I will show you will have to have a 

00:00:58.729 --> 00:01:02.479
 cargo ship so shows you where is the 4th 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:06.590
 hear I wanted to enjoy for you 

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:08.870
 to say that basso srichapan by pass it was 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.340
 found tags in berkane witcher moldy 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:13.280
 behind blick ch we'll find this 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:15.080
 week did not work on glitches 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.970
 during this week what's that how 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.140
 it can be a mess so we have 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:22.070
 found this topic we still have others 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:23.630
 tracks so I'm showing you exactly where 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.060
 is the hospital to do this 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.800
 that no cargo bob so if you go 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.420
 do you go into the garage 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:32.120
 you will see this turn there you eat 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:34.550
 and there these winners 48 years that I took 

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:35.960
 to put there to take few names 

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:37.130
 but we do not care we can do what 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.610
 you want with any error 

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:43.430
 always so you enter your buddy is going 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:45.830
 you take the road to vote as to 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:47.060
 village he faces early but it can 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:48.860
 very well be a turning point but you 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.660
 can not sell it after so 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.400
 I advise you can sell 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:54.260
 the answer you want us you 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.060
 can pull to get away as you 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:58.480
 can get away as much as possible 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:00.890
 I will ask for the personal vehicle 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.730
 at the moment that I press on request of 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.159
 personal vehicles 

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:05.960
 I will go quickly in my garage 

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:08.149
 not especially hurry I'm going 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.220
 enter the garage where the 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:11.690
 slope to power you'll see she 

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:13.700
 appears she has reappeared 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:15.500
 it happened asked people 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.730
 excluded go into the corner there you 

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.840
 go accelerated you'll see that can 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.939
 not to leave the vehicle 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.290
 so if you're going to take out of the 

00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:22.760
 vehicle and look good 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:25.269
 I asked my friends to let go 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:28.819
 vehicle here you and that disappears 

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:31.390
 you will go to the very bottom 

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:33.920
 go out with a bmx 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.510
 once outside with the bmx that you 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.250
 will do that faster and more 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.109
 quickly possible without wasting time when 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.569
 even you can take it took me 

00:02:39.109 --> 00:02:46.670
 an hour we do not care what but just 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:48.019
 get in the back and bmx once 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:51.139
 the interest that bmx 

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:54.290
 you have it out with the punto to 

00:02:51.139 --> 00:02:58.299
 so again so to vote buddies you 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:03:02.150
 wait well ahead with the cargo bob 

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:04.669
 but you're going out we'll make you 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:06.819
 exactly the same thing he goes the 

00:03:04.669 --> 00:03:06.819
 to touch 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:13.459
 he will jump with his embargo 

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:15.590
 he will move away however here this 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:17.629
 lasting treat too fast and that I 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.700
 double if not Algeria to get his 

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:21.349
 find mikulic so again 

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.909
 get away from losing the bob of what 

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:24.099
 you will be able to request the vehicle 

00:03:22.909 --> 00:03:26.599
 staff 

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:28.549
 So there I go ask my vehicle 

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:30.199
 personal and new like I come in 

00:03:28.549 --> 00:03:30.829
 in the garage this time always 

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:32.690
 in the garage 

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:36.709
 the dam ie where he brings 

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:38.269
 to exactly the same because at one time 

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:39.530
 or a garage you will see your 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:42.409
 coat level pop 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:43.459
 you will go inside once 

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:44.870
 in it you'll see that this time 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:45.290
 you will be able to go out with the 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.060
 vehicle 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:48.979
 that's because he would put the little 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:51.859
 manipulate with the bike otherwise it could not 

00:03:48.979 --> 00:03:52.190
 not go out so we will end up 

00:03:51.859 --> 00:03:53.569
 outside 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:54.799
 me what am I going to do because I 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:56.840
 advise you the site make peace 

00:03:54.799 --> 00:03:58.909
 leicester and put the police shut 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:00.949
 eyes meanwhile I'm going to you 

00:03:58.909 --> 00:04:02.180
 pass on the dynamic city for 

00:04:00.949 --> 00:04:04.639
 explain pretty much what you do 

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:05.780
 will have to do that then so you 

00:04:04.639 --> 00:04:07.370
 will you find two assets even 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:08.540
 vehicle it will be all iraq and the 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:11.269
 will say that we receive from all 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:12.079
 first see so we find ourselves in 

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:14.209
 the bubble my friend 

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:15.500
 well it's not my vehicle because I 

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:16.880
 the do with it but it's like I 

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:18.380
 explain to you how to do this then 

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:20.180
 that you will do once you have 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:22.039
 my car and that I you 

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:25.520
 got out with the vehicles to activate them 

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:28.580
 the passive mode your skin must stick a 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:31.340
 c4 or anything explosive about 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:32.750
 your vehicle flying if you do 

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:34.340
 be careful that my two friends 

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:38.139
 without liabilities 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:38.139
 otherwise it will make him explode his cargo 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:42.979
 so you go you do not have to 

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:44.690
 you move away there we move away 

00:04:42.979 --> 00:04:47.470
 obliged at all everything that will have to 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:50.930
 do is blow up your car 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:54.410
 and you have to take the opportunity to say 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:56.090
 that there I say me but when I say me 

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:57.889
 it's to say the person who makes 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:59.780
 what's duplicating when I said coliseum 

00:04:57.889 --> 00:05:01.340
 before the private game advance it takes 

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:03.199
 tell the person who duplicates vehicles 

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:04.820
 body that will have to do 

00:05:03.199 --> 00:05:06.350
 so here I saw you against and saw it 

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:07.040
 my friend whom you see he explained 

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:08.630
 The Minister 

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:10.660
 so I'm going to show you exactly 

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:12.830
 like the same source everything is going to start from 

00:05:10.660 --> 00:05:14.290
 of the life of the person who duplicates 

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:19.180
 you see a little the passive tangy 

00:05:14.290 --> 00:05:19.180
 play hake c4 on the vehicle 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:23.300
 anytime a little history I 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:24.169
 do not expose me with I do 

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:26.450
 explode the vehicle 

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:27.320
 you see that it tells me nothing there you 

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:29.419
 get out of your vehicle 

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:31.190
 it means your personal vehicle and 

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:33.289
 electric you go back in 

00:05:31.190 --> 00:05:35.210
 you will see his access card to 

00:05:33.289 --> 00:05:39.020

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:42.410
 mutually mutually mutually 

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:44.750
 French called she does not go this contract 

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:47.080
 because what are you going to do from 

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:49.039
 now is asking the staff 

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:50.930
 exactly as before and you go 

00:05:49.039 --> 00:05:52.520
 return with 7 points early in a garage 

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:55.130
 in the garage that I told you to 

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:57.139
 fill before what needs to be filled 

00:05:55.130 --> 00:05:58.070
 of vehicles you want to replace 

00:05:57.139 --> 00:06:00.020

 replaced as soon as you agree 

00:06:03.889 --> 00:06:07.849
 so all replaced by the vehicle that 

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:09.889

00:06:07.849 --> 00:06:11.090
