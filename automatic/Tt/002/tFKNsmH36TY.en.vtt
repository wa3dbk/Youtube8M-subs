deals<00:00:05.130> with<00:00:05.370> the<00:00:05.490> fact<00:00:05.670> that<00:00:05.850> when<00:00:06.089> we<00:00:06.120> bring<00:00:06.480> a

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
deals with the fact that when we bring a

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.709 
deals with the fact that when we bring a
light<00:00:06.810> in<00:00:07.080> closer<00:00:07.830> to<00:00:08.160> a<00:00:08.189> subject<00:00:08.760> it<00:00:09.269> becomes

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
light in closer to a subject it becomes

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:12.140 
light in closer to a subject it becomes
softer<00:00:10.260> it<00:00:10.469> becomes<00:00:10.800> effectively<00:00:11.340> larger<00:00:11.940> and

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
softer it becomes effectively larger and

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.049 
softer it becomes effectively larger and
therefore<00:00:12.929> softer<00:00:13.559> the<00:00:14.070> effect<00:00:14.429> of<00:00:14.580> softness

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
therefore softer the effect of softness

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.050 
therefore softer the effect of softness
is<00:00:15.269> increased<00:00:16.230> even<00:00:16.440> greater<00:00:16.859> by<00:00:17.550> moving<00:00:17.820> the

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
is increased even greater by moving the

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.880 
is increased even greater by moving the
light<00:00:18.240> around<00:00:18.510> blending<00:00:19.410> the<00:00:19.529> shadow<00:00:19.770> to

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:19.890 
light around blending the shadow to

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.609 
light around blending the shadow to
highlight<00:00:20.070> transitions<00:00:21.230> in<00:00:22.230> this

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
highlight transitions in this

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.320 
highlight transitions in this
demonstration<00:00:23.220> I'll<00:00:23.550> be<00:00:23.640> using<00:00:23.699> the<00:00:24.119> same

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
demonstration I'll be using the same

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.999 
with an adapter and diffusers which
increase<00:00:30.539> the<00:00:30.570> size<00:00:30.960> of<00:00:31.140> the<00:00:31.230> light<00:00:31.410> from<00:00:31.800> the

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:32.009 
increase the size of the light from the

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:34.970 
increase the size of the light from the
small<00:00:32.279> LED<00:00:32.910> chip<00:00:33.329> to<00:00:33.840> one<00:00:34.350> inch<00:00:34.590> in<00:00:34.770> diameter

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.119 
small LED chip to one inch in diameter
which<00:00:35.880> is<00:00:35.910> a<00:00:36.090> huge<00:00:36.510> increase<00:00:36.719> in<00:00:36.960> softness<00:00:37.469> due

00:00:38.119 --> 00:00:38.129 
which is a huge increase in softness due

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:40.369 
which is a huge increase in softness due
to<00:00:38.250> demand<00:00:38.520> from<00:00:38.879> workshop<00:00:39.690> students<00:00:40.170> I've

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:08.890 
using the same light source I'm in very

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:11.010 
using the same light source I'm in very
very<00:01:09.100> close<00:01:09.460> maybe<00:01:09.850> just<00:01:10.119> an<00:01:10.240> inch<00:01:10.450> away<00:01:10.630> and

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:11.020 
very close maybe just an inch away and

very close maybe just an inch away and
I'm<00:01:11.650> moving<00:01:11.890> the<00:01:12.130> light<00:01:12.310> to<00:01:13.240> blend<00:01:13.540> the<00:01:13.780> shadow

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:13.810 
I'm moving the light to blend the shadow

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.170 
I'm moving the light to blend the shadow
to<00:01:14.200> highlight<00:01:14.340> transitions<00:01:15.340> and<00:01:15.550> you'll<00:01:16.000> see

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:16.180 
to highlight transitions and you'll see

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:17.700 
to highlight transitions and you'll see
that<00:01:16.360> the<00:01:16.479> result<00:01:16.810> is<00:01:16.960> much<00:01:17.200> more<00:01:17.380> pleasing

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:17.710 
that the result is much more pleasing

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:20.190 
that the result is much more pleasing
and<00:01:18.070> much<00:01:18.520> softer<00:01:18.790> and<00:01:19.240> this<00:01:19.570> is<00:01:19.690> the<00:01:19.810> exact

understand<00:01:41.590> I<00:01:41.890> prefer<00:01:42.789> to<00:01:42.910> light<00:01:43.060> individual

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:43.780 
understand I prefer to light individual

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.540 
understand I prefer to light individual
elements<00:01:44.289> in<00:01:44.410> my<00:01:44.530> images<00:01:44.920> so<00:01:45.130> that<00:01:45.160> I<00:01:45.310> can

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:45.550 
elements in my images so that I can

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:47.040 
elements in my images so that I can
control<00:01:45.820> the<00:01:46.060> lighting<00:01:46.270> for<00:01:46.570> each<00:01:46.750> of<00:01:46.930> those

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:47.050 
control the lighting for each of those

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:50.190 
control the lighting for each of those
elements<00:01:47.640> by<00:01:48.640> getting<00:01:48.940> in<00:01:49.030> very<00:01:49.240> close<00:01:49.539> I<00:01:49.869> can

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:50.200 
elements by getting in very close I can

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.380 
elements by getting in very close I can
create<00:01:50.470> a<00:01:50.530> beautiful<00:01:50.800> soft<00:01:51.399> light<00:01:51.670> which

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:52.390 
create a beautiful soft light which

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.249 
create a beautiful soft light which
cannot<00:01:52.690> be<00:01:52.840> achieved<00:01:52.960> in<00:01:53.350> any<00:01:53.470> other<00:01:53.740> way
