00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:14.190 
way now what you want to do is cover
this<00:04:12.140> entirely<00:04:12.829> with<00:04:13.130> plastic<00:04:13.640> wrap<00:04:13.670> and

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:14.200 
this entirely with plastic wrap and

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.259 
this entirely with plastic wrap and
refrigerate<00:04:15.200> it<00:04:15.680> for<00:04:15.799> at<00:04:16.070> least<00:04:16.370> two<00:04:16.669> hours<00:04:16.700> or

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:17.269 
refrigerate it for at least two hours or

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:19.449 
refrigerate it for at least two hours or
overnight<00:04:17.299> and<00:04:18.260> then<00:04:18.680> we'll<00:04:18.889> bake<00:04:19.039> it<00:04:19.220> later

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:19.459 
overnight and then we'll bake it later

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:21.849 
overnight and then we'll bake it later
so<00:04:19.970> we'll<00:04:20.090> put<00:04:20.239> this<00:04:20.389> in<00:04:20.600> the<00:04:20.690> fridge<00:04:20.900> and<00:04:21.229> I'll

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:21.859 
so we'll put this in the fridge and I'll

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:23.590 
so we'll put this in the fridge and I'll
show<00:04:22.070> you<00:04:22.100> the<00:04:22.340> next<00:04:22.789> step<00:04:22.940> after<00:04:23.270> that<00:04:23.419> so

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:23.600 
show you the next step after that so

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.390 
show you the next step after that so
it's<00:04:23.690> been<00:04:23.840> a<00:04:23.870> couple<00:04:24.080> hours<00:04:24.500> and<00:04:24.740> I've

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:25.400 
it's been a couple hours and I've

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.420 
it's been a couple hours and I've
created<00:04:25.610> the<00:04:26.000> oven<00:04:26.240> to<00:04:26.419> 350<00:04:27.110> degrees<00:04:27.320> and<00:04:27.889> i'm

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:28.430 
created the oven to 350 degrees and i'm

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:30.190 
created the oven to 350 degrees and i'm
just<00:04:28.580> going<00:04:28.820> to<00:04:28.850> uncover<00:04:29.360> this<00:04:29.570> doesn't

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:30.200 
just going to uncover this doesn't

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:32.290 
just going to uncover this doesn't
really<00:04:30.320> look<00:04:30.500> too<00:04:30.740> much<00:04:30.860> different<00:04:31.310> and<00:04:31.490> i'm

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:32.300 
really look too much different and i'm

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:33.909 
really look too much different and i'm
going<00:04:32.479> to<00:04:32.570> bake<00:04:32.720> it<00:04:32.840> for<00:04:32.870> about<00:04:33.020> 40<00:04:33.500> minutes<00:04:33.530> or

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:33.919 
going to bake it for about 40 minutes or

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:36.580 
going to bake it for about 40 minutes or
until<00:04:33.950> it's<00:04:34.340> golden<00:04:34.820> and<00:04:35.090> the<00:04:35.570> filling<00:04:36.110> is<00:04:36.289> set

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:36.590 
until it's golden and the filling is set

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:39.070 
until it's golden and the filling is set
so<00:04:36.979> it's<00:04:37.130> been<00:04:37.310> 40<00:04:37.700> minutes<00:04:37.880> and

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:39.080 
so it's been 40 minutes and

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:42.070 
so it's been 40 minutes and
is<00:04:39.400> the<00:04:40.400> coffee<00:04:40.639> cake<00:04:41.000> looks<00:04:41.720> and<00:04:41.930> smells

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:42.080
