00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.650

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:16.590

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.580
 color groups namely the news and 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.590

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:25.260
 right and the moss and plus the lipsticks 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:25.619

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.539
 colors 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.310
 what is so special about the estée 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.619
 pure color envy is that they are you 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:34.079
 dating that there is a lot of pigment it 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.550
 is also to finish too much color in a v 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.160
 and it contains a special complex 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:40.440
 namely the time release and the chicken fillet 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.120
 moisture complex a whole mouth full 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.010
 It means that it is your lips the whole way 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.620
 time dated wood and way your lips 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.140
 does one on the other so this then comes one 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.340
 new kind of beautiful shirley notation free 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.530
 making your lips very much 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.570
 so stay nourished and hydrated 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.160
 feels very comfortable 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:58.260
 but it also really hydrates you 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.149
 lips that make you just very soft and 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.340
 like smooth lips like when you 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:03.809
 lip balm would use the estee 

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.309
 Lauder pure color lipsticks would envy 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.930
 have to sit for six hours after me 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.000
 I tested them of course 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.710
 they don't get the six hours from me because 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.240
 if they are rather creamy, they are going something 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.220
 faster off your lips but all 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.020
 meal they definitely survive the 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.750
 strongest shine does go from the lipstick 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.400
 but definitely the color that stays real 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.770
 or illness bread myself a lot of fun 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.970
 think of this new lipstick line is that 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.549
 there are so many colors that there are before 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.930
 everyone has a 10 tips that fits the 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.970
 There are four families who are there 

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:31.920
 families in every group there is something 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.329
 what is with you I also have four 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.369
 select colors that I think of 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.470
 well that suit me i will be four 

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:39.780
 just swatch lipsticks and show them 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.070
 both on my arm and on my lips 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.689
 the packaging of my new estée 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.119
 lauder pure color envy is really bad 

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:47.040
 pretty very tight close the lipstick with the 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:51.439
 magnet and that gives a very luxury 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:54.659
 feeling when I set it up like that now 

00:01:51.439 --> 00:01:57.000
 here I have four colors from each color 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:02:00.469
 family I have one from the news and 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.469
 I have brown's that are sidetable 

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:13.100
 I have information about the pimps and berries 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:28.250
 of grains and the right I have in patient 

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.250
 very nice orange red color 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.860
 and from Moses and Plums I am in the setting 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.260
 plan 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.440
 it is a very beautiful dark purple red 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.440
 colour 

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.080
 the plus points of the estée lauder pure 

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:55.330
 color envy lipsticks 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:56.830
 it is firstly the packaging I find 

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:58.600
 who work very well and he is 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:00.550
 just very beautiful and the magnet 

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.680
 I find it very chic it feels very 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:04.570
 think it is chic about the color choice 

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.460
 very good in 20 colors and in 

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:08.530
 every family has a color that 

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:11.230
 with you brings very easy 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.610
 it is very novel it feels on 

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:15.310
 comfortable on your lips and they stay 

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:16.420
 really sit for six hours but 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:17.770
 the lipsticks survive a meal 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:20.050
 certainly 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:21.610
 they have a very subtle vanilla scent 

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:23.380
 and but they taste so nowhere 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:25.780
 I find it very pleasant and the 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:27.610
 formula is a kind between matt and 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.930
 shiny in it is not super shine but 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:31.000
 around that super mat and that is a formula 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:32.560
 kind of finish that a lot of women 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.060
 I think you are very beautiful 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.080
 just somewhere in the middle and keep it there 

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:36.610
 I like it myself 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.950
 if i have to think of a downside it 

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:40.750
 yes the price is 32 euros each 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:42.220
 does not drive cheap for that 

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:44.560
 lipstick but for a lipstick of 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:46.720
 seek quality that is so beautiful for so long 

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.980
 remains as feels comfortable 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.540
 a price that I personally like that 

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:51.220
 want to pay for a color that i 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:53.770
 very beautiful 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:55.630
 my favorite color is the bizarre sphere 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:58.180
 I just showed it to you and me 

00:03:55.630 --> 00:04:00.370
 color and Slade have now plan 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:02.800
 my lips but I find a design role myself 

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:04.150
 the most beautiful color in the entire line so that 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:06.850
 also prefers to wear 

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:09.310
 this is my short one but i hope full 

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:11.950
 review of the estée lauder pure color 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:14.200
