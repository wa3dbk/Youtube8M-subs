their out on track they just look into
what<00:00:34.250> left<00:00:34.460> behind<00:00:34.730> as<00:00:34.850> they<00:00:35.030> can<00:00:35.239> lay<00:00:35.360> down<00:00:35.600> so

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:35.960 
what left behind as they can lay down so

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.780 
what left behind as they can lay down so
we're<00:00:36.590> as<00:00:36.710> a<00:00:36.739> normal<00:00:36.830> race<00:00:37.250> there<00:00:37.519> will<00:00:37.610> be

winner time attack doesn't have that

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:45.700 
winner time attack doesn't have that

layin session where the competitors can
go<00:00:48.170> out<00:00:48.320> together<00:00:48.500> I<00:00:48.799> they<00:00:48.979> can<00:00:49.100> go

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:49.250 
go out together I they can go

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.340 
go out together I they can go
individually<00:00:49.610> now<00:00:50.360> a<00:00:50.390> set<00:00:50.720> amount<00:00:50.809> of<00:00:51.049> time<00:00:51.110> to

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:51.350 
individually now a set amount of time to

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.770 
individually now a set amount of time to
lay<00:00:51.769> down<00:00:51.799> if<00:00:52.159> we<00:00:52.280> just<00:00:52.460> left<00:00:52.850> they<00:00:53.000> can<00:00:53.239> so

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:53.780 
lay down if we just left they can so

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.360 
lay down if we just left they can so
that's<00:00:54.170> why<00:00:54.320> he's<00:00:54.350> different<00:00:54.920> from<00:00:55.070> a<00:00:55.339> normal

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:55.370 
that's why he's different from a normal

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.720 
that's why he's different from a normal
race<00:00:55.940> meeting
