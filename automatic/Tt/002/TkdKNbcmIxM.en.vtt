00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:23.460 
position so you could play out wide

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.370 
position so you could play out wide
right<00:00:23.699> could<00:00:24.570> play<00:00:24.689> in<00:00:24.990> the<00:00:25.140> middle<00:00:25.350> of

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:25.380 
right could play in the middle of

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.259 
right could play in the middle of
midfield<00:00:25.590> he<00:00:26.340> does<00:00:26.730> the<00:00:26.820> same<00:00:26.939> thing<00:00:27.150> for

midfield he does the same thing for

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:28.670 
midfield he does the same thing for
Honduras<00:00:27.720> as<00:00:27.869> what<00:00:28.050> we're<00:00:28.170> expecting<00:00:28.349> of<00:00:28.590> them

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
Honduras as what we're expecting of them

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.650 
Honduras as what we're expecting of them
here<00:00:28.859> to<00:00:29.070> you<00:00:29.580> know<00:00:29.609> have<00:00:30.179> them<00:00:30.269> on<00:00:30.359> the<00:00:30.449> field

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
here to you know have them on the field

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:31.790 
here to you know have them on the field
haven't<00:00:30.869> be<00:00:30.929> a<00:00:30.960> productive<00:00:31.230> player<00:00:31.470> would<00:00:31.710> be

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
haven't be a productive player would be

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.170 
haven't be a productive player would be
out<00:00:31.920> wider<00:00:32.130> in<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:32.369> middle<00:00:32.579> i<00:00:32.700> think<00:00:33.090> is

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
out wider in the middle i think is

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.180 
out wider in the middle i think is
preferred<00:00:33.480> position<00:00:34.230> though<00:00:34.380> is<00:00:34.559> on<00:00:35.070> the

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
preferred position though is on the

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.770 
preferred position though is on the
right<00:00:35.309> side<00:00:35.489> of<00:00:35.550> midfield<00:00:35.610> which<00:00:35.969> is<00:00:36.120> the<00:00:36.329> one

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
right side of midfield which is the one

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:37.790 
right side of midfield which is the one
of<00:00:36.840> the<00:00:36.899> reasons<00:00:37.140> we<00:00:37.230> were<00:00:37.320> looking<00:00:37.530> at<00:00:37.590> I

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800 
of the reasons we were looking at I

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:38.900 
of the reasons we were looking at I
think<00:00:37.980> you<00:00:38.040> could<00:00:38.100> play<00:00:38.219> out<00:00:38.250> wide<00:00:38.489> right<00:00:38.670> for

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
think you could play out wide right for

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.369 
think you could play out wide right for
us<00:00:38.940> obviously<00:00:39.180> there's<00:00:39.660> if<00:00:40.020> there's<00:00:40.140> a<00:00:40.290> need

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
us obviously there's if there's a need

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:42.200 
us obviously there's if there's a need
to<00:00:40.500> have<00:00:40.620> him<00:00:40.710> play<00:00:40.829> in<00:00:40.920> the<00:00:40.980> middle<00:00:41.250> I<00:00:41.370> think

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
to have him play in the middle I think

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.520 
to have him play in the middle I think
you<00:00:42.270> could<00:00:42.360> play<00:00:42.510> in<00:00:42.570> there<00:00:42.719> too<00:00:42.899> he's<00:00:43.320> a<00:00:43.379> very

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
you could play in there too he's a very

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.500 
you could play in there too he's a very
smart<00:00:43.770> player<00:00:43.950> and<00:00:44.280> you<00:00:44.760> know<00:00:44.820> in<00:00:45.090> a<00:00:45.239> pinch<00:00:45.450> you

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:45.510 
smart player and you know in a pinch you

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:46.520 
smart player and you know in a pinch you
go<00:00:45.660> play<00:00:45.780> him<00:00:45.899> in<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:46.020> back<00:00:46.140> i<00:00:46.289> think<00:00:46.469> the

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
go play him in the back i think the

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.020 
go play him in the back i think the
backs<00:00:46.710> one<00:00:46.890> of<00:00:46.950> our<00:00:47.039> strengths<00:00:47.309> were<00:00:47.399> looking

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030 
backs one of our strengths were looking

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:49.910 
backs one of our strengths were looking
at<00:00:48.120> a<00:00:48.149> map<00:00:48.360> but<00:00:48.600> i<00:00:48.750> think<00:00:49.200> wide<00:00:49.350> riot<00:00:49.649> would<00:00:49.800> be

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
at a map but i think wide riot would be

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:51.049 
at a map but i think wide riot would be
the<00:00:50.010> place<00:00:50.160> he's<00:00:50.610> going<00:00:50.760> to<00:00:50.820> feel<00:00:50.940> comfortable

00:00:51.049 --> 00:00:51.059 
the place he's going to feel comfortable

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:52.970 
the place he's going to feel comfortable
and<00:00:51.360> we<00:00:51.660> feel<00:00:51.809> comfort<00:00:52.110> with<00:00:52.199> him<00:00:52.320> that's<00:00:52.829> the

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
and we feel comfort with him that's the

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.110 
and we feel comfort with him that's the
good<00:00:53.100> thing<00:00:53.160> I'm<00:00:53.430> I<00:00:53.520> thought<00:00:53.699> number<00:00:53.879> i<00:00:53.940> never

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120
