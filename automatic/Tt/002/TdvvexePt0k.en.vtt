 sound is emitted if another barking

 inhibiting a new stimulation 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:48.130
 is conditioned by the absence of 

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.580

 sound alone without stimulation the beeps 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.920
 sound will probably be insufficient 

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.720
 departure to stop his barking 

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.130
 but they will allow him to understand 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.140
 future events 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:07.330
 after a period of a few hours if 

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:09.160
 your dog continue to send added 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:11.470
 short stimulation then have it so what 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.940
 is not enough it's not about 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.930
 definitely stop the barking 

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:18.420
 but to limit the nuisances 

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:18.420
 caused by excessive barking 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:26.420
 Oh
