00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:06.230
 We will show the following property 

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:08.029
 We will show that it is included in 

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:09.769
 united with come let's prove is 

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:11.929
 appropriate 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:15.200
 well graphically we can see the 

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:19.119
 next way we have together to 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.119
 and we're going to have the set d 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.500
 and then the union would be all this 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.500
 part 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:31.760
 this would talk has united with good and 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:34.700
 only the set a is this 

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:38.000
 we can see that that set is 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:39.710
 included in the union this is going to 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.670
 show then then we go 

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:42.670
 to put on show 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.970
 then let's grab an element 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:52.170
 let's put first in the definition 

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:54.960
 of inclusion that is the following 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.089
 there it is when it is included instead 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.159
 it means that yes alone and for everything x 

00:00:57.089 --> 00:01:02.760
 that belongs to the team will belong 

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:05.220
 then x is going to belong ab not this 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:08.460
 would be the definition 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.960
 even this then what are we going to 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.080
 do the following we are going to grab a 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.100
 element x that will belong to 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:16.050
 then we will show that it is the 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.100
 element x will also belong to 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:20.939
 united with b 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.939
 let us begin 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:32.890
 for everything x for everything x that belongs to 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:37.950
 let's have the following x 

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:41.329
 will belong to then 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.329
 xv or belong 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.170
 in this case 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.880
 ox 

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:53.299
 it will belong 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.829
 let's see let's show that this 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:58.369
 proposition that we have put here is 

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:58.369
 true 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:04.140
 then what are we going to do this x that 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:07.330
 belongs to will represent my p 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:10.929
 here belongs to smith 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:13.299
 and that belongs to thermal view 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:16.480
 then we know by 

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:19.930
 propositions that p then I see this 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:22.640
 It is always true , therefore not 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:27.150
 this proposition is going to be true 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:30.540
 there is that is the concept 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:34.430
 so let's put it like this, not this is going to 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:34.430
 be true not 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:44.830
 because if we give him pe like no 

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:47.610
 x that belongs to this value 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:47.610
 and we give him 

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:54.600
 co 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:54.600
 equal to x that belongs ab 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.920
 Then we will show what 

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:05.610
 or in this case 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.460
 p then 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:17.100
 ocu 

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:21.190
 that is true not by 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:23.500
 propositions not where we already know that I 

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:24.910
 represent also that it belongs to and that 

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.790
 will represent me here 

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:31.700
 belongs to come or rather is this 

00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:34.900
 is equivalent to this from here not 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:37.390
 therefore when have the following 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:39.530
 how is this proposition true 

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:42.019
 then by definition of union 

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:44.209
 we know that it belongs to today 

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:48.280
 which belongs to b means that it is going to 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:51.200
 belong to united with beno then 

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:57.760
 let's have the following as x 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:57.760
 belongs to then x will belong 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:06.400
 united with come or not there is then already 

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:08.230
 we know that it belongs to or x that 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:11.050
 belongs to see is how to say x that 

00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:13.770
 belongs to the union then we are 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:13.770
 demonstrating 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:20.759
 what is going to be 

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:20.759
 be included in a nest with poison 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:27.200
 then we say there is no 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:30.650
 no way 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:35.300
 it will be included 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:38.270
 in has joined with good there are and that 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:41.020
 it would be the answer we will not see each other 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:41.020
