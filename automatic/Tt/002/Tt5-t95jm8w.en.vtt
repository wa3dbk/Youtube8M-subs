 hello my dear viewer topic 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.460
 such as changing commander's light bulb to 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.340
 I once had my own 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:22.800
 already such a video but it is moral 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.439
 outdated changed patch changed 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.030
 fashion and so on and so forth and 

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:27.869
 the task itself sounds as follows 

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:30.180
 way 

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.790
 hello plumber how to change a light bulb 

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.629
 I want a commander on my own 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.360
 cut out 

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:38.610
 photo former and put in place 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:42.420
 light bulbs to scare everyone 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.920
 time when my tank shine opponents ok 

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.440
 let's try that for this 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.630
 will need first must necessarily 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.489
 mods that change 

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:53.190
 the view of this light bulb is otherwise nothing 

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:56.190
 it turns out if they are installed then we 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:59.040
 we can modify to put our 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.600
 picture Well firstly it secondly in 

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.390
 second we need a graphic 

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:05.250
 editor windows 7 and above can 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.440
 use pain there 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.990
 graphic editor and of course difficult 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:12.810
 do something well well guys here already 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.740
 nothing can be done is desirable of course 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.360
 photoshop 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:20.520
 okay, take a photo of your ex 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:23.330
 now neatly and and cut out 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:27.420
 we delete the background, that is, we delete all unnecessary and 

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:30.300
 we get this image here again 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.819
 did see for yourself what to delete 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:35.780
 what not to remove what to leave exactly 

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:38.250
 delete all the background we should not be 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:40.530
 here it is the shaded surface 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.420
 it's nothing it's emptiness 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.099
 that is, if you don't remove the background from it 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.560
 there will be such a square picture 

00:01:44.099 --> 00:01:49.649
 be highlighted if you removed the fund and 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:52.770
 You will be here is a photo of the former 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:54.899
 without any squares and so on that is 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:56.429
 the outline will be highlighted that 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.640
 actually can only please 

00:01:56.429 --> 00:02:00.470
 need to be reduced to normal size 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:04.370
 let's so on 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:06.200
 it is 500 seeds, but somewhere like this 

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:09.350
 can maybe a little bigger maybe a little 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:11.270
 smaller but this is the selection method and all 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:14.390
 this ugliness needs to be kept 

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:17.590
 it is in png format so where do we have here 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:20.060
 pong format by typing why 

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.880
 I ’m not an editor editor 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:25.370
 I do not remember exactly, but I think in the paint 

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.990
 xp no png format that is, it is in this 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.930
 format in my opinion can not work 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:33.050
 wrong do not want to say so 

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:42.459
 ok and now save this file under 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:46.100
 name six six senses 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:48.980
 png here it should be 

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:52.330
 I hope you can see the name there, but if 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:52.330
 not visible improve the quality of the picture 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:03:04.590
 save ok close photoshop yes 

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:07.590
 ok save so now 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:11.610
 open where we are there that saved 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:12.989
 so this file could I use it 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.150
 total commander can basically 

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:19.110
 conductor the same thing make a difference 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:23.099
 and open the drive c folder games folder 

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:26.970
 world of tanks res-mods folder so 

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:32.069
 so so so in my folder mods decide 

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:32.400
 resources xvm cut and this sixth file 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:35.430
 sense 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.870
 png if you are afraid to spoil something 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:40.410
 rename it to some other 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:44.069
 the file here I’m not particularly afraid 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:48.090
 so just copying from one side to 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:50.400
 I replace the other in this way and we get 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:53.459
 output image former 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:57.269
 instead of a light bulb commander well let 's 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:04:00.569
 look at the screen and enjoy the fact that 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:02.280
 we finally got it I hope it 

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:04.349
 the video was not worth it 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:06.870
 take him seriously she 's still on 

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:09.450
 in fact, can be a joke 

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:12.209
 will want to make your map pack so 

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:14.400
 not an intricate way to start 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:15.540
 of course with the commander's light bulbs and the same 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.070
 the easiest on 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:19.250
 Well, today I have everything 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:21.989
 subscribe to the channel put 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:24.690
 Likely maybe went out sometime 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:29.180
 we will build similar in the same style 

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:29.180
 but for now 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:38.990
 but
