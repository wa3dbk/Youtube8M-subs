00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:11.549
 We sold because we still continues 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:14.280

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:16.409

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.540
 but today you find in our 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.490
 old videogames here in são paulo by 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.830
 example I do not know if you know the 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:25.740
 holy effigy there sells more or less 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.990
 for $ 300 you know what the game was 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:31.700
 most played by super nintendo 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.700
 I'm sure you've already played 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:41.240
 that's right people is the super today was mário 

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:44.390
 sold more than 20 million copies in the 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:47.689
 whole world and is the 18th most 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:50.090
 commercialized throughout history and comes 

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:56.420
 To the next bass of the video came a 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:59.210
 chooses old hot glue filling 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:03.490
 plush and other in black gray colors 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:08.090
 light gray medium or dark purple and lilac 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:10.429
 needle and crochet scissors white wool black 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.799
 or any thicker line and ink 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:14.450
 white and black relief for details I 

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:16.310
 I'll teach you the trick. 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.290
 to make the control format 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.630
 You'll get two bucks in which 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.459
 lay above gray fabric 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:25.040
 You'll leave more or less here 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:26.060
 space of approximately 10 12 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.650
 centimeters 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.380
 this will also depend a lot on the 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:32.780
 dish size that my dish he has 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:34.519
 27 centimeters in diameter I made one 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.349
 marking around the plate of 

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:38.480
 approximately one centimeter more 

00:02:36.349 --> 00:02:41.870
 for each side and then I passed a 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.579
 straight line here and another down in the area 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:46.010
 of cut she also cut a 

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:46.940
 little bigger than the part that will stay 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.069
 seam 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.620
 after all, cut to start the 

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:54.470
 Sewing I'm going to start down here at 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:56.840
 control to rotate all the way back 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.859
 here below the other side leaves open 

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.049
 down here 

00:02:57.859 --> 00:03:01.730
 I'll give you an ok at the end of the line. 

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:04.400
 Let's start the seam from below to 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:05.569
 joins up the two matches and always 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.609
 upwards 

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:09.709
 the closer a point of the other 

00:03:07.609 --> 00:03:11.569
 Closer, more beautiful will be lonely. 

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:14.269
 with the fact and I will make this culture 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:14.870
 now giving all the way back to that other 

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:16.850
 tip 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:19.549
 I arrived with the culture on this side, I did not 

00:03:16.850 --> 00:03:24.709
 I'll take the line still just needle to 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:26.690
 to turn the opposite of us 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:29.120
 beginning of the video I said the white line 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:31.540
 because it had no gray but the ideal 

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:33.879
 is the gray line to stay the same 

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:36.400
 I decide good people already cut all 

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:38.200
 control parts all the buttons I go 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:40.359
 available here in the description of the 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.549
 video all furniture and popular not 

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:44.379
 part by piece for you to understand 

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:46.209
 First we'll paste the circle. 

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:49.750
 here with the hot glue 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:52.329
 the idea is that you put 

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:54.670
 few arrive as close as possible 

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:56.500
 edge but does not put too much glue to 

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:58.780
 do not program out 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:02.109
 now I'm going to paste these parts of the button 

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:04.540
 lilac in black and then rolled in this 

00:04:02.109 --> 00:04:06.659
 gray part and last I'll put 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:06.659
 on here 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:16.539
 now I'll paste start and select now 

00:04:14.169 --> 00:04:18.910
 I'm going to paste the top button parts 

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:21.130
 then this sign from below I 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:23.710
 I cut a piece of the black line and 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:26.139
 stick it up and in the end I go 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:28.599
 skip this part folded in half and 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:30.280
 rolled into the video game dock put there 

00:04:28.599 --> 00:04:32.560
 inside a drop of hot glue that's 

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.030
 I fixed this part I put the needle 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:36.520
 that on the other end 

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:38.440
 I will pass in the middle this time alone and 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:40.030
 now I'm going to fold that paste hiding 

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.560
 this line I will not let too much 

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:43.810
 long key question that I wanted 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:45.550
 and is optional if you do not want to 

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:47.949
 put in your control does not need 

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:49.960
 also here or there dark gray part 

00:04:47.949 --> 00:04:52.539
 and of course it's very well written 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:54.190
 nintendo that part is optional if you 

00:04:52.539 --> 00:04:56.830
 You may want to write directly in the 

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:58.840
 and not necessarily you 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:01.389
 write nintendo you can put your 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:03.010
 name on anything you want and 

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:06.570
 now it's time to give the details with 

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:06.570
 black and white relief ink 

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:26.460
 now that I know however I will put the 

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:28.350
 filling current to the herein 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:30.030
 inside it gradually 

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:31.200
 settling to stay the same every 

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:33.510
 sides 

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:35.790
 now that it 's dry, I'm going to finish 

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:38.820
 culture here if you want you can 

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:45.240
 pass also the hot glue is ready 

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:47.970
 control and people you liked video

 lake of campaigns social networks 

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:55.700
 and here in the previous video evidence and if the 

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:55.700
 People see themselves in the next video
