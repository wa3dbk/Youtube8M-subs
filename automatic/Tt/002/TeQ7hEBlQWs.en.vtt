00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
let's move on to the Crypt our packages

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:29.540 
let's move on to the Crypt our packages
so<00:00:26.849> we've<00:00:27.000> got<00:00:27.180> the<00:00:27.449> two<00:00:27.930> blue<00:00:28.470> engrams<00:00:28.710> again

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:29.550 
so we've got the two blue engrams again

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.070 
so we've got the two blue engrams again
pretty<00:00:29.880> standard<00:00:30.390> stuff<00:00:30.480> I'm<00:00:30.779> hoping<00:00:31.019> for

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.790 
of a lot over blue engrams now here's
what<00:00:42.149> I'm<00:00:42.270> most<00:00:42.510> interested<00:00:42.660> in<00:00:43.140> I've<00:00:43.410> got

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
what I'm most interested in I've got

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.860 
what I'm most interested in I've got
five<00:00:44.070> future<00:00:44.550> war<00:00:44.730> cult<00:00:44.910> packages<00:00:45.420> to<00:00:45.539> open

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:45.870 
five future war cult packages to open

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.740 
five future war cult packages to open
and<00:00:46.079> I'm<00:00:46.559> really<00:00:46.980> hoping<00:00:47.309> to<00:00:47.370> get<00:00:47.670> a<00:00:47.940> shader<00:00:48.420> or

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:48.750 
and I'm really hoping to get a shader or

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.290 
and I'm really hoping to get a shader or
a<00:00:48.840> ship<00:00:49.620> a<00:00:49.829> future<00:00:50.280> war<00:00:50.370> cult<00:00:50.550> shader<00:00:50.879> or<00:00:50.969> ship

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
a ship a future war cult shader or ship

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.750 
a ship a future war cult shader or ship
because<00:00:51.780> I<00:00:51.870> have<00:00:52.050> none<00:00:52.530> of<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:52.739> shaders<00:00:53.100> and<00:00:53.219> I

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
because I have none of the shaders and I

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.389 
because I have none of the shaders and I
don't<00:00:54.149> have<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.510> ship<00:00:54.750> either<00:00:54.989> so<00:00:55.399> hopefully

00:00:56.389 --> 00:00:56.399 
don't have the ship either so hopefully

00:00:56.399 --> 00:00:58.729 
don't have the ship either so hopefully
we'll<00:00:56.850> find<00:00:56.879> some<00:00:57.480> in<00:00:57.660> these<00:00:57.930> packages<00:00:58.559> so

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
we'll find some in these packages so

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:01.549 
we'll find some in these packages so
let's<00:00:59.070> open<00:00:59.340> and<00:01:00.180> see<00:01:00.210> what's<00:01:00.600> going<00:01:00.930> down<00:01:00.960> a

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:01.559 
let's open and see what's going down a

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.490 
let's open and see what's going down a
strange<00:01:02.460> coin<00:01:02.850> and<00:01:03.059> a<00:01:03.120> motive<00:01:03.449> light<00:01:03.750> not<00:01:04.379> the

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
strange coin and a motive light not the

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.679 
strange coin and a motive light not the
best<00:01:04.710> start<00:01:05.000> let's<00:01:06.000> see<00:01:06.150> what<00:01:06.270> else<00:01:06.360> we<00:01:06.540> have

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
best start let's see what else we have

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:06.950 
best start let's see what else we have
here

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
here

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.770

particularly of worth here come on we

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.690 
particularly of worth here come on we
need<00:01:12.510> a<00:01:12.570> shader<00:01:12.869> -<00:01:13.500> motes<00:01:13.740> of<00:01:13.890> fucking<00:01:14.430> light

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
need a shader - motes of fucking light

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.410 
need a shader - motes of fucking light
we<00:01:15.479> need<00:01:15.780> a<00:01:16.020> shader<00:01:16.530> or<00:01:16.830> a<00:01:16.920> ship<00:01:17.580> that<00:01:17.939> would<00:01:18.180> be

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
we need a shader or a ship that would be

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.200 
we need a shader or a ship that would be
spiffing<00:01:19.290> here<00:01:19.470> we<00:01:19.560> go

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:20.210 
spiffing here we go

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.630 
spiffing here we go
we've<00:01:21.210> got<00:01:21.360> the<00:01:21.479> sigil<00:01:21.930> obedience<00:01:22.680> again<00:01:23.430> that

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
we've got the sigil obedience again that

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:26.060 
we've got the sigil obedience again that
was<00:01:23.759> looking<00:01:24.119> for<00:01:24.150> so<00:01:24.930> this<00:01:25.170> is<00:01:25.320> our<00:01:25.500> final

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
was looking for so this is our final

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.060 
was looking for so this is our final
hope<00:01:26.100> to<00:01:26.939> get<00:01:27.119> either<00:01:27.270> a<00:01:27.420> shader<00:01:27.810> or<00:01:28.200> a<00:01:28.290> ship

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:29.070 
hope to get either a shader or a ship

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.679 
hope to get either a shader or a ship
here<00:01:29.369> we<00:01:29.520> go<00:01:30.860> booyah<00:01:31.860> neither<00:01:32.670> so<00:01:33.360> that<00:01:33.540> was<00:01:33.659> a

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
here we go booyah neither so that was a

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.130 
here we go booyah neither so that was a
bit<00:01:34.049> of<00:01:34.229> a<00:01:34.500> fucking<00:01:35.189> bust<00:01:35.549> no<00:01:36.180> shaders<00:01:36.689> no

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
bit of a fucking bust no shaders no

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.200 
bit of a fucking bust no shaders no
ships<00:01:37.439> from<00:01:37.650> all<00:01:37.799> console<00:01:38.310> so<00:01:38.759> that<00:01:38.790> means<00:01:39.090> I

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210 
ships from all console so that means I

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.149 
ships from all console so that means I
my<00:01:39.720> grand<00:01:40.020> total<00:01:40.409> of<00:01:40.530> future<00:01:40.799> war<00:01:40.979> cult

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:41.159 
my grand total of future war cult

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:43.910 
my grand total of future war cult
shaders<00:01:41.579> is<00:01:41.729> zero<00:01:42.150> and<00:01:42.509> my<00:01:42.810> ship<00:01:43.079> is<00:01:43.229> zero<00:01:43.470> -<00:01:43.740> so

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
shaders is zero and my ship is zero - so

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.460 
shaders is zero and my ship is zero - so
let's<00:01:44.100> go<00:01:44.280> to<00:01:44.340> the<00:01:45.210> blue<00:01:45.750> bastard

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
let's go to the blue bastard

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.590 
let's go to the blue bastard
also<00:01:46.920> known<00:01:47.100> as<00:01:47.130> the<00:01:47.369> cryptarch<00:01:47.820> give<00:01:48.420> him<00:01:48.570> a

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
also known as the cryptarch give him a

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.560 
also known as the cryptarch give him a
little<00:01:48.750> salute<00:01:49.110> unless<00:01:49.860> the<00:01:50.070> Crypt<00:01:50.759> all<00:01:51.299> of

little salute unless the Crypt all of
the<00:01:51.659> stuff<00:01:51.899> I've<00:01:52.170> got<00:01:52.409> here<00:01:52.619> and<00:01:52.710> let's<00:01:52.860> see<00:01:52.950> if

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
the stuff I've got here and let's see if

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.399 
the stuff I've got here and let's see if
I<00:01:53.100> actually<00:01:53.250> get<00:01:53.610> anything<00:01:53.850> of<00:01:54.329> any<00:01:54.509> value<00:01:54.600> it

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
I actually get anything of any value it

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:56.270 
I actually get anything of any value it
