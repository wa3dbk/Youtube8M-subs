and gameplay in the background now we

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.200 
and gameplay in the background now we

time<00:00:24.390> that<00:00:24.449> we<00:00:24.689> haven't<00:00:24.930> heard<00:00:25.080> before<00:00:25.230> and

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
time that we haven't heard before and

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.349 
time that we haven't heard before and
that<00:00:25.710> was<00:00:25.740> pretty<00:00:26.189> epic<00:00:26.340> but<00:00:27.029> the<00:00:27.150> gameplay

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
that was pretty epic but the gameplay

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:28.880 
that was pretty epic but the gameplay
and<00:00:27.750> cinematics<00:00:28.199> in<00:00:28.320> the<00:00:28.410> background<00:00:28.769> were

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:28.890 
and cinematics in the background were

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.080 
and cinematics in the background were
just<00:00:29.130> the<00:00:29.250> same<00:00:29.429> thing<00:00:29.460> we've<00:00:29.760> seen<00:00:29.970> before

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
just the same thing we've seen before

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.269 
just the same thing we've seen before
from<00:00:30.420> the<00:00:30.570> e3<00:00:30.900> reveal<00:00:30.929> nothing<00:00:31.650> new<00:00:31.980> there

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
from the e3 reveal nothing new there

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:34.370 
from the e3 reveal nothing new there
they<00:00:32.700> did<00:00:32.910> use<00:00:33.120> some<00:00:33.329> new<00:00:33.450> camera<00:00:33.870> angles<00:00:34.260> at

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
they did use some new camera angles at

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:35.810 
they did use some new camera angles at
certain<00:00:34.680> points<00:00:35.040> so<00:00:35.130> we<00:00:35.160> got<00:00:35.370> to<00:00:35.489> see<00:00:35.640> a<00:00:35.670> better

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
certain points so we got to see a better

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.459 
certain points so we got to see a better
glimpse<00:00:36.120> at<00:00:36.329> a<00:00:36.360> couple<00:00:36.690> little<00:00:36.809> things<00:00:36.930> we

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
glimpse at a couple little things we

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.350 
glimpse at a couple little things we
didn't<00:00:37.770> actually<00:00:37.890> get<00:00:38.280> any<00:00:38.489> new<00:00:38.790> footage<00:00:39.180> but

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
didn't actually get any new footage but

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.610 
didn't actually get any new footage but
like<00:00:39.510> I<00:00:39.600> said<00:00:39.660> there<00:00:39.899> was<00:00:40.020> some<00:00:40.170> new<00:00:40.290> camera

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:40.620 
like I said there was some new camera

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:42.170 
like I said there was some new camera
angles<00:00:41.010> so<00:00:41.309> you<00:00:41.370> got<00:00:41.520> to<00:00:41.610> see<00:00:41.760> things<00:00:41.910> from<00:00:42.059> a

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
angles so you got to see things from a

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.670 
angles so you got to see things from a
slightly<00:00:42.329> different<00:00:42.480> perspective<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:43.500> main

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
slightly different perspective the main

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.080 
slightly different perspective the main
thing<00:00:43.710> I<00:00:43.950> saw<00:00:44.129> was<00:00:44.309> right<00:00:44.550> here<00:00:44.879> with<00:00:45.059> a

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
thing I saw was right here with a

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.850 
thing I saw was right here with a
falling<00:00:45.510> devil<00:00:45.809> Walker<00:00:45.989> sort<00:00:46.320> of<00:00:46.379> launches

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
falling devil Walker sort of launches

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.350 
falling devil Walker sort of launches
the<00:00:47.039> falling<00:00:47.370> shank<00:00:47.730> which<00:00:48.000> is<00:00:48.120> the<00:00:48.210> little

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
the falling shank which is the little

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.299 
the falling shank which is the little
combat<00:00:48.780> assist<00:00:49.140> robot<00:00:49.469> it<00:00:49.680> launches<00:00:50.190> it

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
combat assist robot it launches it

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:51.590 
combat assist robot it launches it
through<00:00:50.489> this<00:00:50.579> little<00:00:50.730> hatch<00:00:50.969> on<00:00:51.180> the<00:00:51.210> side<00:00:51.449> as

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
through this little hatch on the side as

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.810 
through this little hatch on the side as
you<00:00:51.690> can<00:00:51.840> see<00:00:52.050> now<00:00:52.620> we<00:00:52.680> actually<00:00:52.920> already<00:00:53.399> knew

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:53.820 
you can see now we actually already knew

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.250 
you can see now we actually already knew
that<00:00:53.850> the<00:00:54.120> devil<00:00:54.390> Walker<00:00:54.570> could<00:00:54.840> launch<00:00:55.020> these

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
that the devil Walker could launch these

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.319 
that the devil Walker could launch these
shanks<00:00:55.710> so<00:00:55.829> this<00:00:55.980> isn't<00:00:56.250> exactly<00:00:56.309> news<00:00:56.850> but<00:00:57.239> we

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
shanks so this isn't exactly news but we

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:58.910 
shanks so this isn't exactly news but we
never<00:00:57.449> actually<00:00:57.690> saw<00:00:58.170> it<00:00:58.199> before<00:00:58.469> and<00:00:58.770> now

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
never actually saw it before and now

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.410 
never actually saw it before and now
with<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.129> new<00:00:59.219> camera<00:00:59.609> angle<00:00:59.910> we<00:01:00.000> actually

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
with the new camera angle we actually

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.760 
with the new camera angle we actually
get<00:01:00.539> a<00:01:00.570> glimpse<00:01:00.809> of<00:01:00.930> it<00:01:01.020> so<00:01:01.260> that's<00:01:01.530> kind<00:01:01.739> of

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
get a glimpse of it so that's kind of

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.290 
get a glimpse of it so that's kind of
cool<00:01:01.920> other<00:01:02.340> than<00:01:02.609> that<00:01:02.670> though<00:01:02.969> I<00:01:03.000> really

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
cool other than that though I really

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:04.700 
cool other than that though I really
didn't<00:01:03.660> see<00:01:03.780> anything<00:01:03.960> I<00:01:04.170> thought<00:01:04.350> was<00:01:04.559> worth

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
didn't see anything I thought was worth

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.350 
didn't see anything I thought was worth
pointing<00:01:05.070> out<00:01:05.189> as<00:01:05.369> far<00:01:05.580> as<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:05.790> videos<00:01:06.060> go

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
pointing out as far as the videos go

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.210 
pointing out as far as the videos go
like<00:01:06.900> I<00:01:06.990> said<00:01:07.049> it<00:01:07.290> is<00:01:07.320> all<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:07.799> same<00:01:07.830> gameplay

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:08.220 
like I said it is all the same gameplay

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.859 
like I said it is all the same gameplay
reveal<00:01:08.670> but<00:01:08.880> there's<00:01:09.030> a<00:01:09.090> couple<00:01:09.270> new<00:01:09.479> angles

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
reveal but there's a couple new angles

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.990 
reveal but there's a couple new angles
so<00:01:10.380> that's<00:01:10.560> about<00:01:10.770> it<00:01:10.799> now<00:01:11.369> as<00:01:11.549> for<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:11.850> actual

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
so that's about it now as for the actual

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.520 
so that's about it now as for the actual
music<00:01:12.600> which<00:01:12.750> is<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:12.930> whole<00:01:13.049> point<00:01:13.110> of<00:01:13.380> this

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
music which is the whole point of this

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.350 
music which is the whole point of this
we<00:01:13.860> got<00:01:14.010> to<00:01:14.130> hear<00:01:14.280> a<00:01:14.310> couple<00:01:14.640> minutes<00:01:14.880> of<00:01:15.000> epic

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
we got to hear a couple minutes of epic

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.760 
we got to hear a couple minutes of epic
destiny<00:01:15.780> music<00:01:16.110> that<00:01:16.259> we<00:01:16.320> haven't<00:01:16.650> heard

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770

Bungie and they actually gave us a bit

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.719 
Bungie and they actually gave us a bit
of<00:01:28.229> information<00:01:28.530> about<00:01:28.890> this<00:01:29.250> music<00:01:29.369> I'll

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:33.180 
us that this is part of music of the

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.030 
us that this is part of music of the
spheres<00:01:33.240> which<00:01:34.079> is<00:01:34.229> an<00:01:34.350> eighth<00:01:34.530> movement

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:35.040 
spheres which is an eighth movement

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.620 
spheres which is an eighth movement
Destiny's<00:01:35.520> Sweet<00:01:35.549> and<00:01:36.030> this<00:01:36.390> part

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
Destiny's Sweet and this part

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.179 
Destiny's Sweet and this part
specifically<00:01:37.140> that<00:01:37.320> they<00:01:37.439> played<00:01:37.710> today<00:01:37.890> was

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
specifically that they played today was

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:39.710 
specifically that they played today was
movement<00:01:38.460> too<00:01:38.880> but<00:01:39.360> now<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:39.509> real

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:39.720 
movement too but now the real

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.030 
movement too but now the real
interesting<00:01:40.200> part<00:01:40.409> of<00:01:40.470> this<00:01:40.619> is<00:01:40.799> that<00:01:40.950> they

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
interesting part of this is that they

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.639 
interesting part of this is that they
said<00:01:41.310> this<00:01:41.490> is<00:01:41.700> not<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.240> destiny<00:01:42.720> score<00:01:43.110> this

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
said this is not the destiny score this

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.410 
said this is not the destiny score this
music<00:01:43.979> we're<00:01:44.130> hearing<00:01:44.430> is<00:01:44.549> not<00:01:44.820> the<00:01:45.000> destiny

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420 
music we're hearing is not the destiny

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.569 
music we're hearing is not the destiny

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
soundtrack this eight-part orchestral

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.429 
soundtrack this eight-part orchestral
suite<00:01:47.820> is<00:01:48.000> sort<00:01:48.270> of<00:01:48.329> a<00:01:48.420> prequel<00:01:48.930> to<00:01:49.110> the<00:01:49.229> game

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
suite is sort of a prequel to the game

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.410 
suite is sort of a prequel to the game
it's<00:01:49.740> music<00:01:50.220> for<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:50.579> game<00:01:50.759> in<00:01:50.939> a<00:01:51.030> sense<00:01:51.240> but

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420 
it's music for the game in a sense but

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.210 
it's music for the game in a sense but
it<00:01:51.540> isn't<00:01:51.869> actually<00:01:52.049> part<00:01:52.530> of<00:01:52.649> the<00:01:52.710> video<00:01:53.009> game

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:53.220 
it isn't actually part of the video game

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.830 
it isn't actually part of the video game
soundtrack<00:01:53.820> it's<00:01:54.240> something<00:01:54.570> that<00:01:54.689> they're

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
soundtrack it's something that they're

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.539 
soundtrack it's something that they're
doing<00:01:54.960> before<00:01:55.500> the<00:01:55.649> game<00:01:55.799> to<00:01:55.979> sort<00:01:56.159> of<00:01:56.219> set<00:01:56.490> up

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:56.549 
doing before the game to sort of set up

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:58.219 
doing before the game to sort of set up
the<00:01:56.759> mood<00:01:56.969> I<00:01:57.119> suppose<00:01:57.450> I'm<00:01:57.719> a<00:01:58.020> bit<00:01:58.079> confused

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
the mood I suppose I'm a bit confused

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:00.289 
the mood I suppose I'm a bit confused
about<00:01:58.619> it<00:01:58.770> myself<00:01:58.890> but<00:01:59.340> I<00:01:59.549> think<00:01:59.969> it's<00:02:00.090> mainly

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:00.299 
about it myself but I think it's mainly

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.179 
about it myself but I think it's mainly
for<00:02:00.540> us<00:02:00.719> actually<00:02:01.020> like<00:02:01.590> to<00:02:01.710> sort<00:02:01.860> of<00:02:01.950> set<00:02:02.159> up

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:02.189 
for us actually like to sort of set up

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:03.859 
for us actually like to sort of set up
the<00:02:02.399> atmosphere<00:02:02.549> before<00:02:03.060> we<00:02:03.270> actually<00:02:03.450> get<00:02:03.810> a

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
the atmosphere before we actually get a

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.480 
the atmosphere before we actually get a
hold<00:02:04.049> of<00:02:04.140> the<00:02:04.290> game<00:02:04.500> and<00:02:04.740> in<00:02:05.040> marty's<00:02:05.369> own

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
hold of the game and in marty's own

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:06.889 
hold of the game and in marty's own
words<00:02:05.759> he<00:02:05.880> did<00:02:06.030> say<00:02:06.210> that<00:02:06.329> this<00:02:06.420> is<00:02:06.479> sort<00:02:06.750> of<00:02:06.810> a

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
words he did say that this is sort of a

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:08.930 
words he did say that this is sort of a
prequel<00:02:07.380> so<00:02:07.770> this<00:02:07.920> music<00:02:08.250> does<00:02:08.399> sort<00:02:08.640> of<00:02:08.729> tie

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
prequel so this music does sort of tie

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.669 
prequel so this music does sort of tie
into<00:02:09.209> destiny<00:02:09.539> story<00:02:09.959> perhaps<00:02:10.259> it's<00:02:10.560> like

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:10.679 
into destiny story perhaps it's like

00:02:10.679 --> 00:02:12.270 
into destiny story perhaps it's like
sort<00:02:10.979> of<00:02:11.009> the<00:02:11.129> feeling<00:02:11.459> of<00:02:11.550> what<00:02:11.700> happened

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.280 
sort of the feeling of what happened

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:13.980 
sort of the feeling of what happened
for<00:02:12.490> when<00:02:13.030> the<00:02:13.120> traveler<00:02:13.510> came<00:02:13.690> into<00:02:13.900> the

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:13.990 
for when the traveler came into the

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:15.420 
for when the traveler came into the
solar<00:02:14.200> system<00:02:14.620> or<00:02:14.770> something<00:02:15.100> along<00:02:15.190> those

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
solar system or something along those

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.640 
solar system or something along those
lines<00:02:15.520> and<00:02:16.000> the<00:02:16.330> name<00:02:16.510> of<00:02:16.540> the<00:02:16.750> sweet<00:02:16.990> music<00:02:17.530> of

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
lines and the name of the sweet music of

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:19.110 
lines and the name of the sweet music of
the<00:02:17.800> spheres<00:02:17.860> seems<00:02:18.490> to<00:02:18.640> sort<00:02:18.819> of<00:02:18.850> go<00:02:19.000> along

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
the spheres seems to sort of go along

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.880 
the spheres seems to sort of go along
with<00:02:19.420> that<00:02:19.450> like<00:02:19.870> the<00:02:20.020> spheres<00:02:20.350> might<00:02:20.620> be<00:02:20.770> the

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
with that like the spheres might be the

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.650 
with that like the spheres might be the
planets<00:02:21.280> and<00:02:21.430> the<00:02:21.550> traveler<00:02:21.940> I<00:02:22.090> don't<00:02:22.540> really

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
planets and the traveler I don't really

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:24.150 
planets and the traveler I don't really
know<00:02:22.900> I'm<00:02:23.110> a<00:02:23.140> bit<00:02:23.319> confused<00:02:23.350> about<00:02:23.800> it<00:02:24.010> myself

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
know I'm a bit confused about it myself

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.860 
know I'm a bit confused about it myself
but<00:02:24.610> I<00:02:24.670> do<00:02:24.819> know<00:02:25.120> that<00:02:25.150> it<00:02:25.360> sounds<00:02:25.540> pretty

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 
but I do know that it sounds pretty

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:26.970 
but I do know that it sounds pretty
awesome<00:02:25.930> and<00:02:26.380> the<00:02:26.440> whole<00:02:26.590> thing<00:02:26.620> is<00:02:26.770> really

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
awesome and the whole thing is really

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:28.920 
awesome and the whole thing is really
cool<00:02:27.130> now<00:02:27.850> the<00:02:27.910> other<00:02:28.000> thing<00:02:28.209> that<00:02:28.420> he<00:02:28.600> did<00:02:28.720> say

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
cool now the other thing that he did say

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:30.000 
cool now the other thing that he did say
in<00:02:29.020> the<00:02:29.110> interview<00:02:29.170> is<00:02:29.560> that<00:02:29.680> they're<00:02:29.860> really

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.010 
in the interview is that they're really

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:31.860 
in the interview is that they're really
excited<00:02:30.370> to<00:02:30.610> release<00:02:30.760> this<00:02:31.120> at<00:02:31.360> some<00:02:31.540> point<00:02:31.569> in

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
excited to release this at some point in

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:33.660 
excited to release this at some point in
the<00:02:31.959> future<00:02:31.989> this<00:02:32.800> being<00:02:33.130> the<00:02:33.220> eight-part

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
the future this being the eight-part

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.340 
the future this being the eight-part
sweet<00:02:34.030> so<00:02:34.510> that<00:02:34.540> would<00:02:34.810> be<00:02:34.900> really<00:02:35.110> awesome

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:35.350 
sweet so that would be really awesome

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.800 
sweet so that would be really awesome
again<00:02:35.980> he<00:02:36.160> did<00:02:36.190> just<00:02:36.400> say<00:02:36.730> at<00:02:36.940> some<00:02:36.970> point<00:02:37.630> in

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
again he did just say at some point in

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.600 
again he did just say at some point in
the<00:02:37.959> future<00:02:37.989> so<00:02:38.709> we<00:02:38.830> have<00:02:38.920> no<00:02:39.069> idea<00:02:39.370> what<00:02:39.580> that

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:39.610 
the future so we have no idea what that

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:41.370 
the future so we have no idea what that
might<00:02:39.940> mean<00:02:40.000> it<00:02:40.300> could<00:02:40.480> be<00:02:40.569> a<00:02:40.600> long<00:02:40.840> time<00:02:41.110> but

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:41.380 
might mean it could be a long time but

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:42.780 
might mean it could be a long time but
it<00:02:41.500> would<00:02:41.650> definitely<00:02:41.680> be<00:02:42.220> awesome<00:02:42.640> and<00:02:42.730> I

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:42.790
