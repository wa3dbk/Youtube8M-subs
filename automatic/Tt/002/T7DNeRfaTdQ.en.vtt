00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.650
 here is peace xm but finally it came 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.830
 his time how much but I was lying about I already 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:13.110
 no one needs this here's the thing finally 

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:15.300

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:25.290
 which is more relevant than rubbage 

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:28.260
 incomprehensible in general gone and thank God mxm 

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:31.319
 finally he disappeared from my inventory 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:34.019
 and hopefully never go well again 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:35.580
 what we go on further we had our 

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:38.760
 spot prancing 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:40.470
 where it is necessary to put it somewhere, that is 

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.180
 I put a certain subject there 

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:44.840
 who were not interested found old 

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:46.409
 man who we changed this one but on 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:50.220
 desert rebel 

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:52.920
 on a shabby but not a bit on on just 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:54.989
 well-worn rebel better at such things 

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:59.459
 do not barter better tagged on after 

00:03:54.989 --> 00:04:01.170
 field or there is a little well-worn well not 

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:02.879
 there was an exit 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:04.500
 Yes, and he seems to be a bit more expensive 

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:06.030
 it turns out because their number there 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:09.780
 less than after the field 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:12.069
 although he did better, but everything changed 

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:14.730
 plus as usual everything 

00:04:12.069 --> 00:04:17.019
 there are still two trades with us 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:19.509
 next waste us get a little 

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:20.250
 I wore a glossy red 

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:23.949
 gloss 

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:26.199
 the caiman that I traded and 

00:04:23.949 --> 00:04:28.870
 Viper, too, which you menu after 

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:31.150
 field freeman by the way a little well-worn 

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:33.190
 adder after field and orchid era 

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:35.320
 who also recently traded slightly 

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:38.789
 I collected all the knife and changed it to 

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:41.349
 field trip traveler 

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:42.940
 I then of course with him on the mail asya there 

00:04:41.349 --> 00:04:45.789
 there will be a whole story 

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:48.580
 and ways 6 there, too, very much leaned 

00:04:45.789 --> 00:04:49.840
 didn't rise mostly just fell and 

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:52.150
 kept to the bottom 

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:55.240
 but it will be the next series 

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:57.820
 next we finish our tray last 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:05:00.539
 in such a trade we are the same guard 

00:04:57.820 --> 00:05:03.160
 which in this series he exchanged 

00:05:00.539 --> 00:05:05.220
 I changed the dignitas sticker on the map 

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:08.819
 sir a little shabby 

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:11.289
 this time straight factory 

00:05:08.819 --> 00:05:14.409
 I went to the plus so you can say because 

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:19.029
 a little cheese map to make it bigger 

00:05:14.409 --> 00:05:21.520
 will be worth what the guardian and the demand for it 

00:05:19.029 --> 00:05:24.939
 how would I get more so I noticed about 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:28.110
 to see my statistics which I 

00:05:24.939 --> 00:05:29.229
 for themselves lead in more or less why 

00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:32.889
 m4 

00:05:29.229 --> 00:05:36.310
 guardian is certainly not atomic smoothly quarreling 

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:39.520
 and this was the last trade today 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:40.120

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:42.400
