00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:12.810
 trembling 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.310
 n 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.590
 and 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:44.580
 So we consider the entry as 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:44.580
 play intro show 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.840
 so here we will like 5 chords 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:03.380
 first chord on the sixth fret of the bar on 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.939
 eighth year third fourth string 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:08.099
 after this move two years ago 

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.940
 finger placement does not change it 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:11.400
 next chord 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:12.390
 after that we leave finger on 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.610
 fourth fret bar 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:19.019
 but here in the sixth year we put the fifth 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:21.840
 the string after that we will have already shifted to 

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:26.040
 two frets five back and put a chord 

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:30.739
 F sharp in second fret bars in third 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.739
 fret the third string on the fourth fret 4 5 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:38.510
 one more chord on 2 dubai on the fourth 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:41.720
 year 34 countries 

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:48.739
 so what a fight in the sixth fret 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:50.180
 you beat two times down then i have here 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:56.239
 so it looks like there will be a transition from 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:59.810
 this on this court that is two times 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:03.250
 down then twice up 

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:06.070
 hit then down up 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:08.410
 and when you will rise the third 

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:15.640
 times up you go to the next 

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:17.160
 chord this one and here beat twice in 

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:20.720
 two times down 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.720
 and twice up 

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:29.030
 then go on this chord and here 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:31.010
 we will hit hit down up and then 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:34.209
 up again 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:34.209
 and move on to this 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:41.180
 on this chord you play more 

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:42.400
 a six that is two times down three times 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:46.360
 up 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:49.370
 and then down up 

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:52.600
 then go back to this chord 

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:52.600
 beat two times down 

00:03:52.740 --> 00:04:00.500
 then go here and beat twice 

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:02.990
 down but rather two times up 

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:05.510
 and then down up 

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:09.460
 and this entry couplet is played 

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:09.460
 a little easier show 

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:24.240
 and then again so here you add 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:28.110
 A new chord that will need to play 

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:30.720
 this here this is the first year of the bar on 

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:36.810
 second fret second country and the third 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:39.390
 fret 4 you are all chords here 

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:41.009
 will be if you put that is the order 

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:43.590
 this 

00:04:41.009 --> 00:04:46.580
 then this 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:46.580
 then this one 

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:53.310
 and then this one 

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:57.710
 two times down then three times up 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:05:04.310
 and then down up again twice down 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:04.310
 three times up down up and turn 

00:05:05.289 --> 00:05:15.220
 next so play the couplet 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:15.220
 watch the final part of the chorus 

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:54.840
 that is, you notice 1 2 2 times that is, I 

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:58.169
 repeat the same chords 

00:05:54.840 --> 00:06:02.580
 and only for the third time, well, we're a little bit 

00:05:58.169 --> 00:06:03.320

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:06.210
 pause 

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:10.380
 moving two years ago again two 

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:12.710
 times down then here and here we hit more 

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:12.710

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:22.650

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:26.599

00:06:26.599 --> 00:06:37.330
 same 

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:37.330
 and then again 

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:52.800
 and after that you will before 

00:06:50.530 --> 00:07:03.490
 again put this chord snack and 

00:06:52.800 --> 00:07:04.090
 hit twice then turn off again then 

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:09.729

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:12.220

 fate removed three times down 

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:26.409
 and move this chord volume down 

00:07:23.689 --> 00:07:26.409
 and then abruptly 

00:07:29.610 --> 00:07:32.610
 again 

00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:42.680
