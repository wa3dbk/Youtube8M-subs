00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
there's a tiny bit of bubbling just

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.030 
there's a tiny bit of bubbling just
coming<00:01:21.540> up<00:01:21.659> on<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:21.930> very<00:01:22.200> bottom<00:01:22.470> rear<00:01:22.860> edge

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
of the near side door I suppose the

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.249 
of the near side door I suppose the
right<00:01:29.820> color<00:01:30.119> I<00:01:30.210> suspect<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.720> tailgate<00:01:31.140> has

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
right color I suspect the tailgate has

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:32.600 
right color I suspect the tailgate has
been<00:01:31.409> painted<00:01:31.590> at<00:01:31.829> some<00:01:32.040> point<00:01:32.280> because<00:01:32.430> the

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
been painted at some point because the

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.640 
been painted at some point because the
pain<00:01:32.790> feels<00:01:33.030> slightly<00:01:33.329> rough<00:01:33.630> on<00:01:34.439> the

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
pain feels slightly rough on the

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.850 
pain feels slightly rough on the
tailgate<00:01:34.890> so<00:01:35.369> suspect<00:01:35.759> that<00:01:35.880> spin<00:01:36.860> that's

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
tailgate so suspect that spin that's
