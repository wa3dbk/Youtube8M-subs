00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:26.910
 in 15 years of PRD governments the 

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.210
 The city's natural resources have been 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.210
 degraded 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:37.290
 30% of the df water is lost in 

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:40.690
 leaks and clandestine shots 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:43.120
 approximately 140,000 df houses 

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:45.300
 they are not connected to the water network 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.300
 public 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.870
 it is estimated that in the aquifer of the 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.870
 city there is an overexploitation of 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.870
 35% 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:01.610
 in 2011 we only had 122 days with 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.610
 good air quality 

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.790
 a large percentage of the garbage is 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:08.790
 Deposit in the open 

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.070
 until when 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:20.520
 beatriz paredez proposes 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:28.670
 we will conclude at the fair whose investment 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:30.799
 will be 1,600 million pesos 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:34.030
 and we will generate an intensive strategy 

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:34.030
 leak repair 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.910
 we will build a catchment system 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:41.690
 rain and we will use water for 

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:41.690
 recharge of aquifers 

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:47.440
 with the participation of the private sector 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:49.280
 we will make the garbage have its own 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:52.369
 solution 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:54.700
 it's time for us all to win and win the 

00:01:52.369 --> 00:01:54.700
 city
