00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:11.280
 hi guys all right now talking hair 

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:14.639
 so I came here to do a review for 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:17.400
 you from the album laugh at alfaparf this 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:20.400
 button here from a pound and if the 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.170
 version and has an older version that 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.390
 was a white package with steel but 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.269
 continues to be marketed 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:31.250
 both the old and the old for what I 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:35.129
 vi is so blue and ball 

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:36.710
 The smell is strong but not bad and it has 

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:38.579
 people who said they smelled 

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:42.300
 disinfectant then I do not know which version 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:43.879
 This old one does not have any and this one is 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:46.350
 the river to the kremlin 

00:00:43.879 --> 00:00:51.450
 It smells like a little bit. 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:53.820
 weaker and he is white boy is 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:56.520
 following the old version was also a 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.160
 the standard of one kilo and in the new 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:01.199
 version in the old version does not 

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:05.009
 I half a kilo and have this new 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:07.200
 Then it 's the staff version. 

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:11.400
 always spoke very well both of the new 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:13.170
 as old and only that is the following is a 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.880
 reconstructive treatment I 'm 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:17.189
 preparing a post as the timeline 

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:19.530
 capillary that will be left for you to 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:22.530
 difference and hydration 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.640
 reconstruction but held that what already 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.189
 left post 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.439
 then a reconstructive treatment is 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:31.320
 base of keratin proteins of 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:34.049
 collagen that can make hair hard 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:35.250
 because your hair hard if it does not 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.829
 you need this kind of 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.939
 treatment or is not prepared 

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:43.470
 It was a hair that the feet and that you have 

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:46.110
 you have resected that you have not 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.540
 by the stages of hydration and nutrition 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.700
 before he will not hardly accept 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.320
 well the reconstruction so I'm doing 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.270
 hydration and nutrition and hydration 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.710
 pressure has been there for a 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.020
 week and a half I do not think of 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.790
 construction a couple of weeks actually 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:02.549
 who is not afraid was a rush not 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.799
 Arrive, so I ended up relaxing well in the 

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:08.610
 hair but I never stopped doing 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:11.310
 nothing I always used is some line some 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:13.680
 ball up mask I got to use more 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.100
 so in the shower, and now let's go 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.130
 try a rebuild 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:20.770
 If anything will happen then he 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:23.560
 has basically the old had collagen 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:26.920
 which is highly reconstructive the new 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:30.400
 It's because it's basically like that. 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:32.470
 speak the components but in principle 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:36.520
 more active as soon as the 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:42.280
 hydrolyzed wheat has an optimum 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:44.620
 castor oil and hydrolyzed milk protein 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.600
 so what am I seeing here? 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:48.760
 it has moisturizing ingredients 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.640
 nutritional reconstructor this is very 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:54.910
 common, then it is difficult to even 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:56.590
 a mask he said reconstructor let's 

00:02:54.910 --> 00:03:00.370
 see in the hair the effect it gives you 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:02.170
 and this one also has protein and also 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:04.630
 has principles strategy then it rolled 

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:07.570
 twice with shampoo or mix two 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:09.460
 portions of themselves for allowing to 30 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:11.980
 minutes rinse and dispense 

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:13.480
 conditioner because this brand has a 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.150
 acid ph 

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:18.910
 This one is three and a half and that four is 

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.350
 it may be that one really has decency 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:23.380
 Conditioner I do not usually do this 

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:24.940
 but as the staff that made the neighbor is 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:26.800
 better to sit because other than the hair 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:29.470
 can not stay even Saturday 

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:32.860
 So I'm going to do this test too. 

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:36.130
 then I'll wash hydrate is spending 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:39.810
 ck rinse product and whether or not 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:42.820
 back to tv cruise I went back up soon 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:46.480
 prontinho I've seen already left the 

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:47.890
 acting product already rinse boring law is 

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:50.050
 that only with dryer without using any 

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:52.930
 do not let the 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:54.550
 end result is what I felt when 

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:57.880
 I applied the product 

00:03:54.550 --> 00:04:00.010
 He's kind of rude then, he's fine. 

00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:02.560
 easy to pass and it's not that 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:05.800
 product that melts hair and hair 

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:07.480
 well but he has an audience and 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:09.970
 not god hair product from my side 

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:11.890
 You are experiencing hair environment but not 

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:14.890
 so soft that include you cut 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:17.080
 practical effect is melting hair and 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:18.880
 so as soon as I know I realize 

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:19.930
 hair was very bright looked good 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:24.070
 soft 

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:25.430
 I do not know if you'll see the big one. 

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:27.500
 ben saltinho 

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:30.710
 the hair is solitary that gives a 

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:31.789
 Clean hair feeling so I liked it 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:33.889
 enough 

00:04:31.789 --> 00:04:39.770
 but I continue with my tips 

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:43.820
 cigarettes continues the tips he does not 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:45.169
 thus improved 10% of the accounts only then 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:46.310
 so I want to make it clear that this is 

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:48.500

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:52.300
