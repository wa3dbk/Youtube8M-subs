00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:07.830
 3 this section is focused on the principles and techniques for applying the 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.970
 horseshoes on a horse prepared according to the financial system I remember 

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:16.970
 during helmet preparation we should not invade compressed force miku 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:18.419
 sensitive tissue 

00:00:18.419 --> 00:00:22.099
 Remove the old horseshoe cross and observe the small dirt stain 

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:24.070
 that stays compact against the palm 

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:28.289
 is the horseshoe is designed to retain these broken small particles 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.360
 because they promote healthy growth of the palm and provide support to the 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:33.110
 play or 

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:37.430
 to achieve a flat sole flush that dirt or to remove them consistently in 

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:41.440
 the stolen fabric of the sole being careful not to invade the active tissue 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.360
 of the sole cut out the excess of helmet just at the height of the plane 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:50.220
 the soles staying out of the white line the amount that needs to be 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.250
 trim is different on each horse 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.350
 then it is cooking until it reaches the same level over the entire surface 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:02.200
 xerez and the horseshoe of the appropriate size bunbury go to the heels at 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:06.070
 same time that will keep the area of ​​the day keys observe the new 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:10.520
 hard war to see if it is uneven remember the horseshoe not 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:11.930
 must be heated 

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:15.920
 put the tungsten batteries in the four buildings destined for it 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.290
 letting it stand out about two and a half millimeters and this is what is going 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.870
 to ensure maintaining strong traction and will help us maintain 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:25.870
 constant the starting point of the helmet 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.670
 choose the smallest possible nails considering that they should 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.950
 remain immobile in the helmet kiko the appropriate shape will depend on the helmet 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.979
 with which you work the position of the horseshoe is that in which they are covered 

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:44.590
 the heels and you can safely use the two front races and the psoe 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:48.290
 both heels of the horseshoe of benestar equidistant to the center of the 

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:52.229
 ranilla kilos while holding moss we will use the least number of nails 

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:55.229
 possible until we secure the position 

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.180
 we will cut the lights aligning with the angle that forms the vice side of the 

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:08.259
 horseshoe on active horses in this angle is maintained with its own 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:11.369
 Steps 

00:02:11.369 --> 00:02:15.409
 is to cook we have gently the periphery of the helmet wall along d 

00:02:15.409 --> 00:02:18.409
 all the edge of the horseshoe 

00:02:18.929 --> 00:02:22.719
 we will check that the starting point of your adventure using the song of the 

00:02:22.719 --> 00:02:25.719
 rockfish its other straight material 

00:02:29.869 --> 00:02:33.819
 when we finish does not soften the tips of the exception nails and expand with 

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:36.819
 they choose it to the wall 

00:02:38.069 --> 00:02:41.639
 it is better to return the horse by reaching for the accumulation of earth that 

00:02:41.639 --> 00:02:45.229
 will have it under the palm is always better rather than the dirt it takes from the 

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:49.019
 stable we will also remind the owner that it is not necessary 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:51.499
 remove earth from the hull between rajes 

00:02:51.499 --> 00:02:55.409
 in hands in most cases the horse will not have to be wrong 

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:58.509
 new between six and ten weeks depending on conditions
