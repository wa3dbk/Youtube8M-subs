the wall if I did any if I put it up any
thicker<00:03:32.200> than<00:03:32.440> that<00:03:32.620> I'd<00:03:33.549> surely<00:03:34.000> have<00:03:34.359> it<00:03:34.989> you

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:35.470 
thicker than that I'd surely have it you

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:38.160 
thicker than that I'd surely have it you
know<00:03:35.560> peel<00:03:35.980> or<00:03:36.220> slump<00:03:36.639> down<00:03:36.940> into<00:03:37.780> the<00:03:37.900> bottom

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.170 
know peel or slump down into the bottom

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:45.000 
know peel or slump down into the bottom
of<00:03:38.230> the<00:03:38.290> form<00:03:41.310> now<00:03:42.310> the<00:03:43.150> rate<00:03:43.739> at<00:03:44.739> which<00:03:44.769> I

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:45.010 
of the form now the rate at which I

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.190 
of the form now the rate at which I
build<00:03:45.280> this<00:03:45.459> wall<00:03:45.730> up<00:03:46.000> on<00:03:46.180> a<00:03:46.239> high<00:03:46.870> vertical

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200 
build this wall up on a high vertical

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:51.990 
build this wall up on a high vertical
like<00:03:47.620> this<00:03:48.000> this<00:03:49.000> is<00:03:49.180> a<00:03:49.209> 15<00:03:49.750> inch<00:03:49.780> high<00:03:50.200> wall<00:03:51.000> so

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000 
like this this is a 15 inch high wall so

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.809 
like this this is a 15 inch high wall so
the<00:03:52.180> timing<00:03:52.629> of<00:03:52.750> this<00:03:52.989> is<00:03:53.409> really<00:03:54.310> important

00:03:54.809 --> 00:03:54.819 
the timing of this is really important

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:57.360 
the timing of this is really important
because<00:03:55.659> if<00:03:55.959> I<00:03:56.049> build<00:03:56.260> too<00:03:56.470> much<00:03:56.650> material<00:03:57.220> up

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370 
because if I build too much material up

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:57.780 
because if I build too much material up
too

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:57.790 
too

00:03:57.790 --> 00:03:59.880 
too
quickly<00:03:58.209> I<00:03:58.450> could<00:03:58.930> get<00:03:59.170> all<00:03:59.349> the<00:03:59.500> way<00:03:59.530> up<00:03:59.620> to

00:03:59.880 --> 00:03:59.890 
quickly I could get all the way up to

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:02.910 
quickly I could get all the way up to
the<00:04:00.010> top<00:04:00.219> here<00:04:00.870> you<00:04:01.870> know<00:04:01.959> turn<00:04:02.260> my<00:04:02.469> head<00:04:02.650> for<00:04:02.680> a

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:02.920 
the top here you know turn my head for a

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.069 
the top here you know turn my head for a
minute<00:04:03.040> and<00:04:04.000> turn<00:04:04.239> around<00:04:04.390> and<00:04:04.810> this<00:04:04.870> whole

00:04:05.069 --> 00:04:05.079 
minute and turn around and this whole

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:08.509 
minute and turn around and this whole
wall<00:04:05.349> might<00:04:05.620> might<00:04:06.489> have<00:04:06.640> slumped<00:04:07.090> down<00:04:07.290> so

00:04:08.509 --> 00:04:08.519 
wall might might have slumped down so

00:04:08.519 --> 00:04:10.619 
wall might might have slumped down so
you<00:04:09.519> don't<00:04:09.670> want<00:04:09.790> to<00:04:09.849> get<00:04:09.909> too<00:04:10.120> far<00:04:10.150> ahead<00:04:10.480> of

you don't want to get too far ahead of

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:14.339 
you don't want to get too far ahead of
yourself<00:04:11.280> you'll<00:04:12.280> also<00:04:12.459> notice<00:04:12.909> that<00:04:13.299> as<00:04:14.140> I

00:04:14.339 --> 00:04:14.349 
yourself you'll also notice that as I

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:16.370 
yourself you'll also notice that as I
got<00:04:14.530> up<00:04:14.709> here<00:04:14.920> as<00:04:15.040> I'm<00:04:15.220> up<00:04:15.250> here<00:04:15.519> at<00:04:15.640> the<00:04:15.760> top

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
got up here as I'm up here at the top

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:21.180 
got up here as I'm up here at the top
I'm<00:04:17.380> applying<00:04:18.340> no<00:04:19.209> more<00:04:19.739> than<00:04:20.739> an<00:04:20.829> eighth<00:04:20.979> of

I'm applying no more than an eighth of
an<00:04:21.310> inch<00:04:21.400> of<00:04:21.609> material<00:04:22.259> so<00:04:23.259> it's<00:04:23.410> actually

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:23.560 
an inch of material so it's actually

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:25.740 
an inch of material so it's actually
thinner<00:04:24.070> up<00:04:24.160> here<00:04:24.340> at<00:04:24.610> the<00:04:24.699> top<00:04:24.910> and<00:04:25.570> what<00:04:25.720> I

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:29.620 
was placing at the bottom I'll thicken

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:33.900 
was placing at the bottom I'll thicken
this<00:04:29.740> up<00:04:29.949> on<00:04:30.190> later<00:04:30.580> passes<00:04:32.250> if<00:04:33.250> as<00:04:33.580> you're

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:33.910 
this up on later passes if as you're

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:36.120 
this up on later passes if as you're
building<00:04:34.300> up<00:04:34.419> the<00:04:34.599> wall<00:04:34.810> you<00:04:35.620> get<00:04:35.770> an<00:04:35.889> area

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:36.130 
building up the wall you get an area

00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:39.570 
building up the wall you get an area
where<00:04:36.490> that<00:04:36.729> starts<00:04:37.210> to<00:04:37.419> sag<00:04:38.460> and<00:04:39.460> you're

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:39.580 
where that starts to sag and you're

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:42.689 
where that starts to sag and you're
pressing<00:04:39.849> it<00:04:40.090> back<00:04:40.240> into<00:04:40.479> place<00:04:41.430> should<00:04:42.430> work

00:04:42.689 --> 00:04:42.699 
pressing it back into place should work

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:47.550 
pressing it back into place should work
but<00:04:43.479> if<00:04:43.599> it<00:04:43.690> continues<00:04:43.810> to<00:04:44.620> say<00:04:45.419> just<00:04:46.419> try<00:04:46.990> to

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:47.560 
but if it continues to say just try to

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:53.249 
but if it continues to say just try to
thin<00:04:47.830> it<00:04:47.949> out<00:04:48.389> and<00:04:49.860> then<00:04:50.860> let<00:04:50.889> it<00:04:51.070> go<00:04:51.190> don't<00:04:52.259> let

00:04:53.249 --> 00:04:53.259 
thin it out and then let it go don't let

thin it out and then let it go don't let

00:04:55.509 --> 00:04:56.969 
you know then just let it set don't keep
trying<00:04:55.840> to<00:04:56.080> Pat<00:04:56.289> it<00:04:56.470> and<00:04:56.500> hold<00:04:56.740> it<00:04:56.860> up<00:04:56.949> because

00:04:56.969 --> 00:04:56.979 
trying to Pat it and hold it up because

00:04:56.979 --> 00:04:59.670 
trying to Pat it and hold it up because
the<00:04:57.310> more<00:04:57.340> I<00:04:57.550> agitate<00:04:58.150> this<00:04:58.330> surface<00:04:58.780> or<00:04:59.410> this

00:04:59.670 --> 00:04:59.680 
the more I agitate this surface or this

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.100 
the more I agitate this surface or this
this<00:04:59.889> backing<00:05:00.190> material<00:05:00.479> the<00:05:01.479> looser<00:05:01.960> it

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:02.110 
this backing material the looser it

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:04.620 
this backing material the looser it
becomes<00:05:02.560> so<00:05:03.280> it's<00:05:03.400> only<00:05:03.610> with<00:05:03.940> a<00:05:04.210> little<00:05:04.510> bit

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:04.630 
becomes so it's only with a little bit

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:07.350 
becomes so it's only with a little bit
of<00:05:04.750> time<00:05:05.020> passing<00:05:05.380> that<00:05:06.250> it's<00:05:06.430> going<00:05:06.760> to<00:05:06.970> you

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:07.360 
of time passing that it's going to you
