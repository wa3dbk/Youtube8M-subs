00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
spring and the shock and shit like that

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.520 
spring and the shock and shit like that
taking<00:01:04.739> that<00:01:04.830> out<00:01:05.040> so<00:01:05.309> I<00:01:06.170> used<00:01:07.170> some<00:01:07.380> of<00:01:07.409> the

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
taking that out so I used some of the

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:09.080 
taking that out so I used some of the
existing<00:01:08.010> hole<00:01:08.189> there<00:01:08.400> on<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:08.549> bottom<00:01:08.880> of<00:01:08.970> the

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
existing hole there on the bottom of the

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.880 
existing hole there on the bottom of the
frame<00:01:09.360> and<00:01:09.689> just<00:01:10.220> basically<00:01:11.220> uh<00:01:12.619> use<00:01:13.619> this

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
frame and just basically uh use this

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:23.510 
frame and just basically uh use this
long<00:01:16.369> extension<00:01:18.350> with<00:01:21.470> this<00:01:22.470> socket<00:01:23.280> that's

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.520 
long extension with this socket that's

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.550 
long extension with this socket that's
like<00:01:23.670> adjustable<00:01:24.390> like<00:01:24.540> you<00:01:25.110> can<00:01:25.259> do<00:01:25.409> like<00:01:25.530> a

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
like adjustable like you can do like a

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.340 
like adjustable like you can do like a
45<00:01:26.100> degree<00:01:26.280> angle<00:01:26.720> 90<00:01:27.720> degree<00:01:28.080> angle<00:01:28.320> like

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
45 degree angle 90 degree angle like

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.960 
45 degree angle 90 degree angle like
it's<00:01:28.590> just<00:01:28.710> adjustable<00:01:29.570> so<00:01:31.759> basically<00:01:32.759> got

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
it's just adjustable so basically got

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.719 
it's just adjustable so basically got
that<00:01:33.180> in<00:01:33.360> there<00:01:33.570> so<00:01:33.799> I<00:01:34.799> could<00:01:35.040> hold<00:01:35.159> my<00:01:35.310> bolts

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
that in there so I could hold my bolts

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:41.240 
that in there so I could hold my bolts
from<00:01:35.939> behind<00:01:36.240> and<00:01:39.710> then<00:01:40.710> finished<00:01:41.040> it<00:01:41.159> off

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
from behind and then finished it off

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.950 
from behind and then finished it off
with<00:01:41.430> the<00:01:41.610> impact

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
with the impact

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.600 
with the impact
I<00:01:44.150> pack<00:01:45.150> them<00:01:45.330> out<00:01:45.479> and<00:01:45.900> they<00:01:46.049> came<00:01:46.200> right<00:01:46.380> out

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:46.610 
I pack them out and they came right out

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.750 
I pack them out and they came right out
on<00:01:47.610> this<00:01:47.880> passenger<00:01:48.540> side<00:01:48.810> one<00:01:49.460> it's<00:01:50.460> kind<00:01:50.670> of

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:50.760 
on this passenger side one it's kind of

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.340 
on this passenger side one it's kind of
harder<00:01:51.060> because<00:01:51.360> you<00:01:51.510> got<00:01:51.659> the<00:01:51.810> fuel<00:01:52.170> lines

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
harder because you got the fuel lines

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:54.980 
harder because you got the fuel lines
coming<00:01:52.680> out<00:01:53.240> from<00:01:54.240> the<00:01:54.420> tank

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:54.990 
coming out from the tank

00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:00.740 
coming out from the tank
so<00:01:55.890> I<00:01:55.920> had<00:01:56.220> my<00:01:57.200> rubber<00:01:58.200> rubber<00:01:58.650> hose<00:01:59.720> gon<00:02:00.720> is

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
so I had my rubber rubber hose gon is

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.350 
so I had my rubber rubber hose gon is
coming<00:02:01.140> out<00:02:01.290> so<00:02:01.440> it's<00:02:01.590> kind<00:02:01.800> of<00:02:01.830> like<00:02:02.180> hard<00:02:03.180> for

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
coming out so it's kind of like hard for

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.810 
coming out so it's kind of like hard for
me<00:02:03.570> because<00:02:03.899> on<00:02:04.140> this<00:02:04.290> top<00:02:04.920> one<00:02:05.190> here<00:02:05.430> on<00:02:05.670> this

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
me because on this top one here on this

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.570 
me because on this top one here on this
top<00:02:06.030> corner<00:02:06.300> one<00:02:06.920> that's<00:02:07.920> the<00:02:08.069> hardest<00:02:08.399> one<00:02:08.550> to

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:08.580 
top corner one that's the hardest one to

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.430 
top corner one that's the hardest one to
get<00:02:08.789> to<00:02:09.000> this<00:02:09.390> one's<00:02:09.660> the<00:02:09.899> bubble<00:02:10.229> blower

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
get to this one's the bubble blower

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.949 
get to this one's the bubble blower
one's<00:02:10.739> easier<00:02:11.190> the<00:02:11.940> top<00:02:12.180> ones<00:02:12.420> okay

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
one's easier the top ones okay

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:14.570 
one's easier the top ones okay
but<00:02:13.410> this<00:02:13.590> one's<00:02:13.800> the<00:02:13.890> hardest<00:02:14.220> because<00:02:14.340> you

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
but this one's the hardest because you

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.360 
but this one's the hardest because you
got<00:02:14.730> the<00:02:14.880> lines<00:02:15.170> that<00:02:16.170> are<00:02:16.410> blocking<00:02:17.130> your

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
got the lines that are blocking your

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:18.830 
got the lines that are blocking your
socket<00:02:17.820> from<00:02:17.940> getting<00:02:18.269> in<00:02:18.390> there<00:02:18.540> so<00:02:18.780> you

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
socket from getting in there so you

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.930 
socket from getting in there so you
can't<00:02:19.110> get<00:02:19.290> in<00:02:19.470> there<00:02:19.620> from<00:02:19.739> the<00:02:19.860> bottom<00:02:20.040> you

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:20.940 
can't get in there from the bottom you

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:22.520 
can't get in there from the bottom you
have<00:02:20.970> to<00:02:21.120> get<00:02:21.390> your<00:02:21.480> socket<00:02:21.900> into<00:02:22.170> the<00:02:22.290> side

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:22.530 
have to get your socket into the side

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:28.910 
have to get your socket into the side
here<00:02:23.180> so<00:02:24.739> I<00:02:25.739> had<00:02:25.860> to<00:02:25.950> take<00:02:26.100> the<00:02:26.220> holes<00:02:26.430> off<00:02:27.920> and

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
here so I had to take the holes off and

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:31.699 
here so I had to take the holes off and
actually<00:02:29.430> uh<00:02:29.459> I<00:02:29.910> fit<00:02:30.690> my<00:02:30.840> socket<00:02:31.170> right<00:02:31.530> in

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
actually uh I fit my socket right in

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:34.490 
actually uh I fit my socket right in
there<00:02:31.920> and<00:02:32.910> actually<00:02:33.450> was<00:02:33.750> able<00:02:33.989> to<00:02:34.019> get<00:02:34.320> it

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
there and actually was able to get it

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:38.449 
there and actually was able to get it
tight<00:02:35.040> enough<00:02:35.070> so<00:02:35.610> I<00:02:35.670> can<00:02:35.900> impact<00:02:36.900> it<00:02:37.050> out<00:02:37.459> now

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
tight enough so I can impact it out now

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:42.190 
tight enough so I can impact it out now
on<00:02:38.640> the<00:02:38.760> driver<00:02:39.000> side<00:02:39.150> is<00:02:39.480> a<00:02:39.510> lot<00:02:39.720> easier

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.720 

because<00:02:43.200> you've<00:02:43.410> got<00:02:43.560> no<00:02:43.739> fuel<00:02:44.010> lines<00:02:44.190> so<00:02:44.550> it's

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
because you've got no fuel lines so it's

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.479 
because you've got no fuel lines so it's
all<00:02:44.910> just<00:02:45.180> a<00:02:45.709> empty<00:02:46.709> hole<00:02:46.890> you<00:02:47.070> can<00:02:47.250> get<00:02:47.370> the

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
all just a empty hole you can get the

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:52.789 
all just a empty hole you can get the
top<00:02:47.730> two<00:02:48.480> bolts<00:02:48.930> for<00:02:49.170> the<00:02:50.269> for<00:02:51.269> the<00:02:51.799> engine

00:02:52.789 --> 00:02:52.799 
top two bolts for the for the engine

00:02:52.799 --> 00:02:55.789

mount<00:02:53.450> you<00:02:54.450> take<00:02:54.690> that<00:02:54.870> out<00:02:55.079> through<00:02:55.350> here<00:02:55.620> and

00:02:55.789 --> 00:02:55.799 
mount you take that out through here and

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:57.510
