the end well I guess more accurately you
could<00:02:38.430> say<00:02:38.730> an<00:02:39.680> end<00:02:41.599> because<00:02:42.599> this<00:02:43.560> is<00:02:43.739> only

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
could say an end because this is only

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.500 
could say an end because this is only
what<00:02:45.690> the<00:02:45.900> second<00:02:46.349> of<00:02:46.530> three<00:02:46.560> endings<00:02:47.310> I'm<00:02:47.700> not

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:48.510 
what the second of three endings I'm not

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:50.120 
what the second of three endings I'm not
entirely<00:02:48.810> clear<00:02:49.140> on<00:02:49.260> the<00:02:49.470> endings<00:02:49.800> of<00:02:49.920> this

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.130 
entirely clear on the endings of this

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:51.770
