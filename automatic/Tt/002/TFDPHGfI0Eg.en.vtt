00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
hit play all right so this is basically

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.410 
hit play all right so this is basically
how<00:00:22.260> you<00:00:22.410> did<00:00:22.650> it<00:00:22.680> as<00:00:22.890> you<00:00:23.609> can<00:00:23.730> see<00:00:23.910> I'm<00:00:24.150> Maura

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:24.420 
how you did it as you can see I'm Maura

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.769 
how you did it as you can see I'm Maura
let's<00:00:24.600> just<00:00:24.779> do<00:00:25.050> an<00:00:25.470> auto-attack<00:00:26.269> IQ<00:00:27.269> after

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
let's just do an auto-attack IQ after

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:29.689 
let's just do an auto-attack IQ after
and<00:00:27.960> then<00:00:28.140> I<00:00:28.199> move<00:00:28.529> so<00:00:29.130> if<00:00:29.250> you<00:00:29.340> want<00:00:29.460> to<00:00:29.519> run

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
and then I move so if you want to run

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:36.270 
and then I move so if you want to run
through<00:00:29.820> it<00:00:29.880> one<00:00:30.029> more<00:00:30.090> time

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:36.280 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.150 

the<00:00:37.210> auto-attack<00:00:37.539> Q<00:00:38.020> the<00:00:38.260> Q<00:00:38.289> cancels<00:00:38.890> the<00:00:38.980> auto

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:39.160 
the auto-attack Q the Q cancels the auto

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:40.709 
the auto-attack Q the Q cancels the auto
attack<00:00:39.460> and<00:00:39.640> then<00:00:39.730> moving<00:00:39.969> cancels<00:00:40.390> the<00:00:40.510> rest

00:00:40.709 --> 00:00:40.719 
attack and then moving cancels the rest

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:42.869 
attack and then moving cancels the rest
of<00:00:40.809> the<00:00:40.899> Q<00:00:41.079> animation<00:00:41.500> so<00:00:42.070> if<00:00:42.160> you<00:00:42.280> do<00:00:42.460> it<00:00:42.610> fast

00:00:42.869 --> 00:00:42.879 
of the Q animation so if you do it fast

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:44.790 
of the Q animation so if you do it fast
you<00:00:43.149> can<00:00:43.300> basically<00:00:43.719> finish<00:00:44.260> it<00:00:44.379> within<00:00:44.530> about

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:44.800 
you can basically finish it within about

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.770 
you can basically finish it within about
a<00:00:44.860> second<00:00:45.309> the<00:00:45.610> second<00:00:45.940> than<00:00:46.089> that<00:00:46.269> if

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:46.780 
a second the second than that if

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:48.900 
a second the second than that if
actually<00:00:47.170> do<00:00:47.379> it<00:00:47.500> could<00:00:47.860> obviously<00:00:48.670> the

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:48.910 
actually do it could obviously the

can eat right before the q and then q
after<00:01:33.940> to<00:01:34.179> extend<00:01:34.569> the<00:01:34.659> range<00:01:34.810> of<00:01:34.990> the<00:01:35.110> q<00:01:35.259> and

after to extend the range of the q and

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.830 
after to extend the range of the q and
people<00:01:35.800> don't<00:01:36.009> really<00:01:36.479> expect<00:01:37.479> it<00:01:37.690> because

spencey to show you that he makes it a

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.690 
spencey to show you that he makes it a
picture<00:02:04.560> or<00:02:05.560> a<00:02:05.620> quicker<00:02:05.950> than<00:02:06.130> normal<00:02:06.190> what<00:02:06.610> at

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:06.700 
picture or a quicker than normal what at

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:11.580 
picture or a quicker than normal what at
least<00:02:07.560> here<00:02:08.560> we<00:02:08.740> can<00:02:08.890> not<00:02:09.280> do<00:02:09.430> it<00:02:09.550> again<00:02:10.590> it

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:11.590 
least here we can not do it again it

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.260 
least here we can not do it again it
just<00:02:11.980> makes<00:02:12.100> it<00:02:12.250> go<00:02:12.370> farther<00:02:12.640> and<00:02:12.880> it<00:02:12.970> makes<00:02:13.210> it

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:13.270 
just makes it go farther and it makes it

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.650 
just makes it go farther and it makes it
go<00:02:13.420> a<00:02:13.450> little<00:02:13.630> bit<00:02:13.810> quicker<00:02:14.020> oh<00:02:14.260> yeah<00:02:15.660> it's

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:16.660 
go a little bit quicker oh yeah it's

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:19.410 
go a little bit quicker oh yeah it's
very<00:02:16.930> very<00:02:17.230> slight<00:02:17.560> yeah<00:02:18.490> does<00:02:18.970> that<00:02:19.120> it's<00:02:19.300> not

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
very very slight yeah does that it's not

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.450 
very very slight yeah does that it's not
like<00:02:19.570> a<00:02:19.630> giant<00:02:19.990> north<00:02:20.350> wing<00:02:20.770> thing<00:02:20.980> well

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:21.460 
like a giant north wing thing well

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:23.370 
like a giant north wing thing well
people<00:02:21.670> can't<00:02:22.120> really<00:02:22.480> see<00:02:22.690> it<00:02:22.810> see<00:02:23.260> the

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:23.380 
people can't really see it see the

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:25.110 
people can't really see it see the
difference<00:02:23.500> so<00:02:24.190> they<00:02:24.520> think<00:02:24.580> it's<00:02:24.880> just<00:02:25.030> a

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
difference so they think it's just a

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:26.670 
difference so they think it's just a
normal<00:02:25.300> kill<00:02:25.600> they<00:02:25.750> probably<00:02:25.930> want<00:02:26.350> to<00:02:26.380> get<00:02:26.560> it

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:26.680 
normal kill they probably want to get it

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:28.200 
normal kill they probably want to get it
will<00:02:26.770> hit<00:02:26.920> them<00:02:27.070> but<00:02:27.640> sometimes<00:02:27.820> it's<00:02:28.150> the

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:28.210 
will hit them but sometimes it's the

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:29.580 
will hit them but sometimes it's the
difference<00:02:28.540> between<00:02:28.600> hang<00:02:29.020> a<00:02:29.110> person<00:02:29.380> or<00:02:29.470> not

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
difference between hang a person or not

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.760 
difference between hang a person or not
hitting<00:02:29.830> your<00:02:29.950> person<00:02:30.250> the<00:02:30.970> and<00:02:31.770> then

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:32.770 
hitting your person the and then

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:34.710 
hitting your person the and then
basically<00:02:33.000> what<00:02:34.000> i<00:02:34.030> wanted<00:02:34.330> to<00:02:34.420> show<00:02:34.600> what

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
basically what i wanted to show what

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:36.780 
basically what i wanted to show what
that<00:02:34.900> is<00:02:35.080> e<00:02:35.350> cancels<00:02:36.070> the<00:02:36.130> animations<00:02:36.670> of

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
that is e cancels the animations of

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.940 
that is e cancels the animations of
everything<00:02:37.180> else<00:02:37.390> so<00:02:37.840> you<00:02:37.870> can<00:02:38.080> cast<00:02:38.290> eeew<00:02:38.860> at

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:38.950 
everything else so you can cast eeew at

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:40.740 
everything else so you can cast eeew at
the<00:02:39.040> same<00:02:39.220> time<00:02:39.370> you<00:02:39.580> can<00:02:39.760> cast<00:02:39.940> ER<00:02:40.510> at<00:02:40.660> the

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:40.750 
the same time you can cast ER at the

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.570 
the same time you can cast ER at the
same<00:02:40.930> time<00:02:41.110> you<00:02:41.620> basically<00:02:41.800> can<00:02:42.250> use<00:02:42.400> e

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
same time you basically can use e

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.340 
same time you basically can use e
anytime<00:02:43.240> you<00:02:43.360> want<00:02:43.480> to<00:02:43.570> use<00:02:43.690> anything<00:02:43.960> else<00:02:44.200> as

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
anytime you want to use anything else as

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:45.960 
anytime you want to use anything else as
well<00:02:44.380> and<00:02:44.560> that<00:02:45.250> will<00:02:45.340> cancel<00:02:45.550> the<00:02:45.730> rest<00:02:45.880> of

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
well and that will cancel the rest of

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:49.140 
well and that will cancel the rest of
whatever<00:02:46.300> is<00:02:46.360> happening<00:02:46.950> so<00:02:47.950> the<00:02:48.520> reason<00:02:48.670> why

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
whatever is happening so the reason why

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:51.810 
whatever is happening so the reason why
i<00:02:49.480> said<00:02:49.780> earlier<00:02:49.900> Hydra<00:02:50.530> was<00:02:50.740> a<00:02:50.800> core<00:02:51.190> item<00:02:51.640> for

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:51.820 
i said earlier Hydra was a core item for

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:54.000 
i said earlier Hydra was a core item for
the<00:02:51.910> build<00:02:52.150> is<00:02:52.510> you<00:02:52.960> can<00:02:53.140> use<00:02:53.170> TMI<00:02:53.740> right

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
the build is you can use TMI right

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:56.340 
the build is you can use TMI right
before<00:02:54.190> an<00:02:54.520> auto<00:02:54.700> tech<00:02:54.940> or<00:02:55.150> a<00:02:55.210> skill<00:02:55.600> and<00:02:55.840> it

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:56.350 
before an auto tech or a skill and it

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:57.960 
before an auto tech or a skill and it
will<00:02:56.440> combo<00:02:56.800> it<00:02:57.040> into<00:02:57.310> the<00:02:57.430> damage<00:02:57.760> in<00:02:57.910> that

00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:57.970 
will combo it into the damage in that

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:00.300 
will combo it into the damage in that
waste<00:02:58.270> time<00:02:58.480> so<00:02:59.050> in<00:02:59.170> the<00:02:59.230> case<00:02:59.380> you<00:02:59.620> say<00:03:00.070> you

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
waste time so in the case you say you

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.490 
waste time so in the case you say you
auto<00:03:00.490> attack<00:03:00.760> then<00:03:01.360> you<00:03:01.540> use<00:03:01.810> tema<00:03:02.230> and<00:03:02.410> the

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
auto attack then you use tema and the

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.740 
auto attack then you use tema and the
Wi-Fi<00:03:02.920> right<00:03:03.610> next<00:03:03.940> to<00:03:04.090> it<00:03:04.120> or<00:03:04.330> right<00:03:04.570> neck

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
Wi-Fi right next to it or right neck

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.990 
Wi-Fi right next to it or right neck
right<00:03:05.050> after<00:03:05.470> that<00:03:05.620> they'll<00:03:06.250> do<00:03:06.430> it<00:03:06.580> instantly

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 
right after that they'll do it instantly

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.220 
right after that they'll do it instantly
and<00:03:07.240> then<00:03:07.360> you<00:03:07.480> don't<00:03:07.570> have<00:03:07.660> to<00:03:07.840> worry<00:03:08.050> about

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 
and then you don't have to worry about

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:10.380 
and then you don't have to worry about
like<00:03:08.650> the<00:03:09.190> cast<00:03:09.580> animation<00:03:10.090> of<00:03:10.150> your<00:03:10.270> heart

skill so especially another way to weave

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.160 
skill so especially another way to weave
and<00:03:14.890> cancel<00:03:15.340> autos<00:03:15.640> or<00:03:15.880> spell<00:03:16.150> animations<00:03:16.690> so

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.170 
and cancel autos or spell animations so

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:18.600 
and cancel autos or spell animations so
that<00:03:17.320> you<00:03:17.380> have<00:03:17.530> a<00:03:17.560> lot<00:03:17.739> of<00:03:17.770> variety<00:03:18.310> and<00:03:18.400> what

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:20.890 
you can use to cancel an auto animation

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:24.030 
you can use to cancel an auto animation
or<00:03:21.040> I<00:03:21.100> spell<00:03:21.489> animation<00:03:22.090> so<00:03:22.750> riven<00:03:23.680> is<00:03:23.770> kind<00:03:23.950> of

or I spell animation so riven is kind of

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:25.290 
or I spell animation so riven is kind of
silly<00:03:24.220> and<00:03:24.430> what<00:03:24.610> you<00:03:24.730> can<00:03:24.880> do<00:03:24.970> with<00:03:25.120> our

silly and what you can do with our
combos<00:03:25.870> it'll<00:03:26.200> take<00:03:26.230> a<00:03:26.380> lot<00:03:26.650> of<00:03:26.680> time<00:03:26.980> to<00:03:27.160> learn
