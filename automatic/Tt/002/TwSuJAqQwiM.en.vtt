00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:37.480 
and I don't particularly like the idea

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.680 
and I don't particularly like the idea
of<00:02:38.050> what's<00:02:38.230> going<00:02:38.500> on<00:02:38.739> there<00:02:39.010> but<00:02:39.310> you<00:02:39.690> know

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
of what's going on there but you know

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.920 
of what's going on there but you know
that's<00:02:40.900> politics<00:02:41.790> the<00:02:42.790> political<00:02:42.940> side<00:02:43.570> of<00:02:43.600> it

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:43.930 
that's politics the political side of it

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:45.930 
that's politics the political side of it
now<00:02:44.380> I<00:02:44.440> think<00:02:44.560> it's<00:02:44.890> bad<00:02:45.100> when<00:02:45.400> anybody<00:02:45.820> should

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:45.940 
now I think it's bad when anybody should

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:48.240 
now I think it's bad when anybody should
come<00:02:46.270> in<00:02:46.390> a<00:02:46.450> mass<00:02:46.720> fit<00:02:47.020> a<00:02:47.050> lot<00:02:47.200> of<00:02:47.230> people<00:02:47.320> but<00:02:48.070> I

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
come in a mass fit a lot of people but I

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.390 
come in a mass fit a lot of people but I
