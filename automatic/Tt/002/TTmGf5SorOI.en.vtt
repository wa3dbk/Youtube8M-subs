yeah<00:00:02.840> and<00:00:03.840> get<00:00:04.170> to<00:00:04.259> watch<00:00:04.380> lifters<00:00:04.859> you<00:00:04.950> can<00:00:05.100> do

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:05.250 
yeah and get to watch lifters you can do

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:22.340 
yeah and get to watch lifters you can do
it<00:00:16.880> okay<00:00:18.890> overlap<00:00:19.890> is<00:00:20.100> the<00:00:20.250> moment<00:00:21.199> that<00:00:22.199> the

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
it okay overlap is the moment that the

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.950 
it okay overlap is the moment that the
intake<00:00:22.710> valve<00:00:22.980> is<00:00:23.189> opening<00:00:23.670> and<00:00:24.570> the<00:00:24.660> exhaust

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
intake valve is opening and the exhaust

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.140 
intake valve is opening and the exhaust
is<00:00:25.109> closing<00:00:25.590> and<00:00:26.010> they<00:00:26.220> do<00:00:26.279> it<00:00:26.490> at<00:00:26.699> the<00:00:26.910> same

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150 
is closing and they do it at the same

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:58.620 
is closing and they do it at the same
time

00:00:58.620 --> 00:00:58.630 

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:00.720 

if<00:00:59.470> you<00:00:59.590> look<00:00:59.770> here<00:00:59.920> ones<00:01:00.160> opening<00:01:00.550> ones

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:00.730 
if you look here ones opening ones

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:02.670 
if you look here ones opening ones
closing<00:01:01.120> at<00:01:01.210> the<00:01:01.300> same<00:01:01.480> moment<00:01:01.660> see<00:01:02.590> it

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:02.680 
closing at the same moment see it

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:07.920 
closing at the same moment see it
rocking<00:01:03.180> okay<00:01:04.320> that<00:01:05.320> is<00:01:05.590> overlap<00:01:05.979> cycle<00:01:06.930> both

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:07.930 
rocking okay that is overlap cycle both

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:09.780 
rocking okay that is overlap cycle both
valves<00:01:08.229> in<00:01:08.530> the<00:01:08.590> head<00:01:08.950> are<00:01:09.130> open<00:01:09.430> at<00:01:09.520> the<00:01:09.610> same

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:09.790 
valves in the head are open at the same

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:12.030 
valves in the head are open at the same
time<00:01:10.090> while<00:01:10.960> the<00:01:11.050> piston<00:01:11.229> is<00:01:11.500> at<00:01:11.619> top<00:01:11.800> dead

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:12.040 
time while the piston is at top dead

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:12.980 
time while the piston is at top dead
center

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
center

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:17.520 
center
that's<00:01:13.990> the<00:01:14.170> overlap<00:01:14.560> cycle<00:01:16.200> this<00:01:17.200> is<00:01:17.380> why

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:17.530 
that's the overlap cycle this is why

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:19.200 
that's the overlap cycle this is why
engines<00:01:17.979> blow<00:01:18.190> up<00:01:18.369> if<00:01:18.700> they're<00:01:18.880> not<00:01:19.000> set<00:01:19.180> up

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:19.210 
engines blow up if they're not set up

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:21.359 
engines blow up if they're not set up
correctly<00:01:19.540> and<00:01:19.930> you<00:01:20.259> click<00:01:20.440> too<00:01:20.590> big<00:01:20.740> a<00:01:21.009> minute

00:01:21.359 --> 00:01:21.369 
correctly and you click too big a minute

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:23.760 
correctly and you click too big a minute
the<00:01:21.970> over<00:01:22.180> life<00:01:22.330> overlap<00:01:23.050> cycle<00:01:23.470> is<00:01:23.530> even

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770 
the over life overlap cycle is even

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:27.980 
the over life overlap cycle is even
longer<00:01:25.080> so<00:01:26.080> by<00:01:26.259> doing<00:01:26.320> that<00:01:26.619> you<00:01:27.369> have<00:01:27.610> zero

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:27.990 
longer so by doing that you have zero

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.480 
longer so by doing that you have zero
compression<00:01:28.990> as<00:01:29.170> the<00:01:29.470> piston<00:01:29.800> comes<00:01:29.950> top<00:01:30.280> dead

00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:30.490 
compression as the piston comes top dead

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:37.560 
compression as the piston comes top dead
center<00:01:33.899> stock<00:01:34.899> engines<00:01:35.320> have<00:01:36.119> almost<00:01:37.119> no

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:37.570 
center stock engines have almost no

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:42.270 
center stock engines have almost no
overlap<00:01:38.460> so<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:41.259> Pistons<00:01:41.649> always<00:01:41.950> come<00:01:42.130> up

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.280 
overlap so the Pistons always come up

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:45.690 
overlap so the Pistons always come up
top<00:01:42.490> dead<00:01:42.729> center<00:01:43.060> with<00:01:43.420> resistance<00:01:44.700> where

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 
top dead center with resistance where

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.130 
top dead center with resistance where
the<00:01:45.880> more<00:01:46.060> Canford<00:01:46.600> in<00:01:46.690> it<00:01:46.810> the<00:01:46.960> less

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140 
the more Canford in it the less

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:53.070 
the more Canford in it the less
resistance<00:01:47.649> R<00:01:47.770> is<00:01:50.910> okay<00:01:51.910> the<00:01:52.360> more<00:01:52.570> overlap

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:53.080 
resistance R is okay the more overlap

00:01:53.080 --> 00:02:03.910 
resistance R is okay the more overlap
you<00:01:53.259> have<00:01:55.560> during<00:01:56.560> that<00:01:56.710> cycle

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:03.920 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.090 

so<00:02:04.460> the<00:02:05.180> more<00:02:05.360> overlap<00:02:05.780> the<00:02:06.229> more<00:02:06.409> radical<00:02:06.590> can

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
so the more overlap the more radical can

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.440 
so the more overlap the more radical can
the<00:02:07.550> cooler<00:02:07.790> the<00:02:08.060> engine<00:02:08.360> run<00:02:08.539> at<00:02:08.780> low<00:02:08.990> speeds

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
the cooler the engine run at low speeds

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.270 
the cooler the engine run at low speeds
high<00:02:11.450> speeds<00:02:11.840> it's<00:02:12.200> just<00:02:12.500> the<00:02:12.620> opposite<00:02:13.010> runs

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:13.280 
high speeds it's just the opposite runs

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.540 
high speeds it's just the opposite runs
hotter<00:02:13.550> than<00:02:13.880> hell<00:02:14.440> because<00:02:15.440> of<00:02:15.590> generating<00:02:16.459> a

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
hotter than hell because of generating a

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.300 
hotter than hell because of generating a
ton<00:02:16.760> of<00:02:16.819> horsepower
