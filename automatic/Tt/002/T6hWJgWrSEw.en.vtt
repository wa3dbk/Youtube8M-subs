00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
where they are because we fished all

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.090 
where they are because we fished all
morning<00:03:45.450> we<00:03:45.930> were<00:03:46.110> down<00:03:46.560> there<00:03:46.590> you<00:03:46.860> told<00:03:47.010> me

morning we were down there you told me

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.250 
morning we were down there you told me
to<00:03:47.190> go<00:03:47.340> further<00:03:48.000> west<00:03:48.240> and<00:03:48.570> to<00:03:48.600> come<00:03:48.780> out<00:03:48.870> here

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
to go further west and to come out here

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:50.390 
to go further west and to come out here
how<00:03:49.500> do<00:03:49.560> you<00:03:49.680> know<00:03:49.800> how<00:03:50.070> they<00:03:50.220> move<00:03:50.370> around

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:50.400 
how do you know how they move around

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.110 
how do you know how they move around
yeah<00:03:50.940> it's<00:03:51.150> in<00:03:51.300> use<00:03:51.450> you<00:03:51.870> have<00:03:51.959> a<00:03:52.020> sixth<00:03:52.350> sense

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:53.120 
yeah it's in use you have a sixth sense

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.430 
yeah it's in use you have a sixth sense
actually<00:03:54.120> probably<00:03:54.540> about<00:03:54.690> 30<00:03:55.110> years

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:55.440 
actually probably about 30 years

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.220 
actually probably about 30 years
experience<00:03:55.850> these<00:03:56.850> fish<00:03:57.150> seem<00:03:57.390> to<00:03:57.570> have<00:03:58.200> a

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
experience these fish seem to have a

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:00.800 
experience these fish seem to have a
winter<00:03:58.560> pattern<00:03:58.740> to<00:03:59.730> them<00:03:59.910> and<00:04:00.090> they<00:04:00.330> stage<00:04:00.600> in

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
winter pattern to them and they stage in

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:02.930 
winter pattern to them and they stage in
certain<00:04:01.140> areas<00:04:01.440> in<00:04:01.620> the<00:04:01.650> bay<00:04:01.890> and<00:04:02.280> this<00:04:02.700> part

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.940 
certain areas in the bay and this part

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:04.670 
certain areas in the bay and this part
of<00:04:03.000> the<00:04:03.090> bay<00:04:03.209> right<00:04:03.239> now<00:04:03.630> is<00:04:03.840> very<00:04:03.870> very<00:04:04.440> active

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:04.680

guide<00:04:38.880> I<00:04:39.090> would<00:04:39.330> say<00:04:39.510> that<00:04:39.720> fish<00:04:39.930> would

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:40.110 
guide I would say that fish would

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:42.590 
guide I would say that fish would
probably<00:04:40.440> go<00:04:40.560> a<00:04:40.590> lot<00:04:40.800> about<00:04:40.979> boat<00:04:41.460> 11<00:04:41.880> it's

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:42.600 
probably go a lot about boat 11 it's

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:45.830 
probably go a lot about boat 11 it's
been<00:04:42.780> gone<00:04:42.960> 11<00:04:43.830> what<00:04:44.580> gets<00:04:44.790> me<00:04:44.970> is<00:04:45.000> they're<00:04:45.419> so

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840 
been gone 11 what gets me is they're so

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:47.480 
been gone 11 what gets me is they're so
thick<00:04:46.290> around<00:04:46.320> like<00:04:46.890> when<00:04:47.040> you<00:04:47.160> pull<00:04:47.370> them

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:47.490 
thick around like when you pull them

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:49.070 
thick around like when you pull them
through<00:04:47.550> is<00:04:48.150> that<00:04:48.390> that's<00:04:48.600> probably<00:04:48.810> an<00:04:48.960> 8

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:49.080 
through is that that's probably an 8

00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:50.750 
through is that that's probably an 8
inch<00:04:49.229> auger<00:04:49.410> hole<00:04:49.740> if<00:04:50.100> that<00:04:50.340> already<00:04:50.550> looks

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:50.760 
inch auger hole if that already looks

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:52.430 
inch auger hole if that already looks
like<00:04:50.910> it's<00:04:51.060> gonna<00:04:51.210> fit<00:04:51.450> through<00:04:51.660> what<00:04:52.410> a

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:52.440 
like it's gonna fit through what a

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.200 
like it's gonna fit through what a
beautiful<00:04:52.740> fish<00:04:53.130> but<00:04:53.370> you<00:04:53.760> know<00:04:53.880> we<00:04:54.030> should

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:20.550 
hooks and this is years ago this hook is

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:22.279 
hooks and this is years ago this hook is
probably<00:06:20.879> three<00:06:21.059> times<00:06:21.239> the<00:06:21.479> size<00:06:21.749> of<00:06:22.050> what<00:06:22.259> it

00:06:22.279 --> 00:06:22.289

probably three times the size of what it
was<00:06:22.529> supposed<00:06:22.889> to<00:06:23.009> be<00:06:23.219> you<00:06:23.429> know<00:06:23.519> when<00:06:23.669> it

00:06:23.719 --> 00:06:23.729 
was supposed to be you know when it

00:06:23.729 --> 00:06:25.639 
was supposed to be you know when it
actually<00:06:23.849> comes<00:06:24.149> from<00:06:24.179> the<00:06:24.329> manufacturer<00:06:24.989> so

00:06:25.639 --> 00:06:25.649 
actually comes from the manufacturer so

00:06:25.649 --> 00:06:26.659 
actually comes from the manufacturer so
that<00:06:25.800> I've<00:06:25.919> got<00:06:26.099> to<00:06:26.219> give<00:06:26.309> you<00:06:26.399> the<00:06:26.489> credit

00:06:26.659 --> 00:06:26.669 
that I've got to give you the credit

00:06:26.669 --> 00:06:28.669 
that I've got to give you the credit

00:06:28.669 --> 00:06:28.679 
because I find that the bigger hooks you

00:06:28.679 --> 00:06:30.409 
because I find that the bigger hooks you
definitely<00:06:29.219> they've<00:06:29.339> got<00:06:29.519> such<00:06:29.789> big<00:06:30.029> hard

00:06:30.409 --> 00:06:30.419 
definitely they've got such big hard

00:06:30.419 --> 00:06:33.139 
definitely they've got such big hard
mouths<00:06:30.689> and<00:06:31.050> sewing<00:06:31.979> the<00:06:32.099> minnow<00:06:32.309> on<00:06:32.399> you<00:06:33.029> know

00:06:33.139 --> 00:06:33.149 
mouths and sewing the minnow on you know

00:06:33.149 --> 00:06:34.879 
mouths and sewing the minnow on you know
I'm<00:06:33.209> sure<00:06:33.360> you<00:06:33.449> do<00:06:33.569> the<00:06:33.689> same<00:06:33.899> thing<00:06:34.229> I<00:06:34.349> put<00:06:34.739> one

00:06:34.879 --> 00:06:34.889 
I'm sure you do the same thing I put one

00:06:34.889 --> 00:06:36.739 
I'm sure you do the same thing I put one
hook<00:06:35.069> through<00:06:35.249> the<00:06:35.339> side<00:06:35.579> and<00:06:35.849> then<00:06:36.479> it<00:06:36.599> put<00:06:36.719> a

00:06:36.739 --> 00:06:36.749 
hook through the side and then it put a

00:06:36.749 --> 00:06:38.629 
hook through the side and then it put a
second<00:06:37.169> one<00:06:37.199> you<00:06:37.649> know<00:06:37.739> up<00:06:37.889> further<00:06:38.159> so<00:06:38.519> it's

00:06:38.629 --> 00:06:38.639 
second one you know up further so it's

00:06:38.639 --> 00:06:41.059 
second one you know up further so it's
actually<00:06:38.819> horizontal<00:06:39.419> on<00:06:40.199> the<00:06:40.499> spoon<00:06:40.799> so<00:06:40.829> it

00:06:41.059 --> 00:06:41.069 
actually horizontal on the spoon so it

00:06:41.069 --> 00:06:42.529 
actually horizontal on the spoon so it
literally<00:06:41.339> Wiggles<00:06:41.879> in<00:06:41.999> front<00:06:42.179> of<00:06:42.239> their<00:06:42.360> nose

00:06:42.529 --> 00:06:42.539 
literally Wiggles in front of their nose

00:06:42.539 --> 00:06:45.289 
literally Wiggles in front of their nose
but<00:06:43.259> I<00:06:43.289> think<00:06:43.559> the<00:06:43.709> oversized<00:06:44.189> hook<00:06:44.699> is<00:06:44.939> one<00:06:45.209> of

00:06:45.289 --> 00:06:45.299 
but I think the oversized hook is one of

00:06:45.299 --> 00:06:46.489 
but I think the oversized hook is one of
the<00:06:45.360> things<00:06:45.569> that's<00:06:45.659> never<00:06:45.869> left<00:06:46.139> me<00:06:46.319> from

00:06:46.489 --> 00:06:46.499 
the things that's never left me from

00:06:46.499 --> 00:06:47.869 
the things that's never left me from
seeing<00:06:46.679> you<00:06:46.769> get<00:06:46.919> those<00:06:47.069> big<00:06:47.309> fish<00:06:47.519> one<00:06:47.759> of<00:06:47.819> the

00:06:47.869 --> 00:06:47.879 
seeing you get those big fish one of the

00:06:47.879 --> 00:06:49.819 
seeing you get those big fish one of the
reasons<00:06:48.239> why<00:06:48.419> we<00:06:48.659> did<00:06:48.899> that<00:06:48.959> years<00:06:49.409> ago<00:06:49.709> is

00:06:49.819 --> 00:06:49.829 
reasons why we did that years ago is

00:06:49.829 --> 00:06:52.249 
reasons why we did that years ago is
going<00:06:50.129> to<00:06:50.249> the<00:06:50.369> heavier<00:06:50.639> hooks<00:06:50.939> was<00:06:51.629> that<00:06:51.869> the

00:06:52.249 --> 00:06:52.259 
going to the heavier hooks was that the

00:06:52.259 --> 00:06:53.779 
going to the heavier hooks was that the
fact<00:06:52.499> that<00:06:52.860> with<00:06:53.009> a<00:06:53.039> lot<00:06:53.249> of<00:06:53.369> these<00:06:53.459> bigger

00:06:53.779 --> 00:06:53.789 
fact that with a lot of these bigger

00:06:53.789 --> 00:06:56.029 
fact that with a lot of these bigger
fish<00:06:54.149> like<00:06:54.689> you<00:06:54.719> say<00:06:55.019> the<00:06:55.199> mouth<00:06:55.379> is<00:06:55.559> so<00:06:55.769> hard

00:06:56.029 --> 00:06:56.039 
fish like you say the mouth is so hard
