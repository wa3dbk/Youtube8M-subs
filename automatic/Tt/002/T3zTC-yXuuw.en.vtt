00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
this portion there's a pack of film and

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.850 
this portion there's a pack of film and
over<00:00:40.510> here<00:00:40.720> is<00:00:40.840> the<00:00:40.990> lens<00:00:41.200> where<00:00:41.500> we're<00:00:41.680> going

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:41.860 
over here is the lens where we're going

over here is the lens where we're going
to<00:00:41.920> put<00:00:42.070> our<00:00:42.220> image<00:00:42.550> that<00:00:42.730> we<00:00:42.820> want<00:00:43.030> to<00:00:43.090> expose

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:43.450 
to put our image that we want to expose

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:46.400 
to put our image that we want to expose
onto<00:00:43.840> the<00:00:43.960> film<00:00:44.200> now<00:00:45.040> when<00:00:45.220> I<00:00:45.250> pull<00:00:45.550> the<00:00:45.700> film

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:46.410 
onto the film now when I pull the film

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:49.650 
onto the film now when I pull the film
out<00:00:47.410> of<00:00:47.590> the<00:00:47.650> machine<00:00:48.100> there's<00:00:48.970> rollers<00:00:49.480> in

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:49.660 
out of the machine there's rollers in

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:52.229 
out of the machine there's rollers in
the<00:00:49.750> machine<00:00:50.140> and<00:00:50.560> they<00:00:51.250> sly<00:00:51.640> it<00:00:51.700> a<00:00:51.970> chemical

00:00:52.229 --> 00:00:52.239 
the machine and they sly it a chemical

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:55.020 
the machine and they sly it a chemical
across<00:00:52.989> the<00:00:53.230> film<00:00:53.530> here<00:00:53.950> and<00:00:54.130> that's<00:00:54.700> what

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:55.030 
across the film here and that's what

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:57.569 
across the film here and that's what
makes<00:00:55.930> the<00:00:56.110> reaction<00:00:56.260> that<00:00:56.680> exposes<00:00:57.460> the

00:00:57.569 --> 00:00:57.579 
makes the reaction that exposes the

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:01.889 
makes the reaction that exposes the
image<00:00:57.960> so<00:00:58.960> I<00:00:58.989> put<00:00:59.260> the<00:00:59.410> image<00:01:00.309> side<00:01:00.579> down<00:01:00.899> and

00:01:01.889 --> 00:01:01.899 
image so I put the image side down and

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:03.990 
image so I put the image side down and
then<00:01:02.050> we<00:01:02.170> take<00:01:02.350> a<00:01:02.410> roller<00:01:02.800> and<00:01:03.100> just<00:01:03.340> roll<00:01:03.850> it

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:04.000 
then we take a roller and just roll it

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.870 
then we take a roller and just roll it
on<00:01:04.229> and<00:01:05.229> the<00:01:05.350> cool<00:01:05.590> thing<00:01:05.619> about<00:01:05.920> the<00:01:06.399> Polaroid

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:06.880 
on and the cool thing about the Polaroid

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:08.819 
on and the cool thing about the Polaroid
transfers<00:01:07.420> is<00:01:07.600> that<00:01:07.780> no<00:01:07.990> two<00:01:08.049> images<00:01:08.530> really

00:01:08.819 --> 00:01:08.829 
transfers is that no two images really

00:01:08.829 --> 00:01:13.109 
transfers is that no two images really
come<00:01:09.009> out<00:01:09.130> the<00:01:09.280> same<00:01:09.520> the<00:01:09.880> film<00:01:10.179> is<00:01:11.310> it's<00:01:12.310> it's

00:01:13.109 --> 00:01:13.119 
come out the same the film is it's it's

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:20.300 
come out the same the film is it's it's
got<00:01:13.359> a<00:01:13.389> lot<00:01:13.600> of<00:01:13.749> variation<00:01:14.439> to<00:01:14.649> it<00:01:19.289> I'm

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
got a lot of variation to it I'm

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.999 
got a lot of variation to it I'm
primarily<00:01:21.310> using<00:01:22.179> emulsion<00:01:22.869> lifts<00:01:23.469> and<00:01:23.679> Stud

00:01:23.999 --> 00:01:24.009 
primarily using emulsion lifts and Stud

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:26.539 
primarily using emulsion lifts and Stud
which<00:01:24.340> is<00:01:24.579> still<00:01:25.299> using<00:01:25.780> the<00:01:25.929> same<00:01:25.959> machine

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:26.549 
which is still using the same machine

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.059 
which is still using the same machine
but<00:01:27.549> instead<00:01:28.060> of<00:01:28.289> cutting<00:01:29.289> it<00:01:29.469> open<00:01:29.829> and

00:01:30.059 --> 00:01:30.069 
but instead of cutting it open and

00:01:30.069 --> 00:01:32.249 
but instead of cutting it open and
pulling<00:01:30.579> it<00:01:30.789> apart<00:01:30.909> to<00:01:31.359> print<00:01:31.630> it<00:01:31.749> onto<00:01:31.959> the

00:01:32.249 --> 00:01:32.259 
pulling it apart to print it onto the

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:35.730 
pulling it apart to print it onto the
paper<00:01:32.499> you<00:01:33.340> fully<00:01:33.639> expose<00:01:34.209> the<00:01:34.689> film<00:01:35.139> for<00:01:35.529> a

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:35.740 
paper you fully expose the film for a

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.510 
paper you fully expose the film for a
minute<00:01:36.159> and<00:01:36.399> then<00:01:37.240> I<00:01:37.420> put<00:01:37.740> contact<00:01:38.740> paper<00:01:38.979> onto

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 
minute and then I put contact paper onto

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.580 
minute and then I put contact paper onto
the<00:01:39.639> back<00:01:39.880> of<00:01:40.240> the<00:01:40.990> image<00:01:41.139> and<00:01:41.619> it<00:01:42.459> soaks<00:01:42.819> in

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
the back of the image and it soaks in

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.949 
the back of the image and it soaks in
160<00:01:44.590> degree<00:01:44.979> water<00:01:45.249> for<00:01:45.939> about<00:01:46.389> three<00:01:46.779> minutes

00:01:46.949 --> 00:01:46.959 
160 degree water for about three minutes

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:49.889 
160 degree water for about three minutes
and<00:01:47.439> then<00:01:48.069> this<00:01:48.219> image<00:01:48.490> lifts<00:01:49.149> off<00:01:49.299> so<00:01:49.810> it

00:01:49.889 --> 00:01:49.899 
and then this image lifts off so it

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:52.739 
and then this image lifts off so it
floats<00:01:50.259> in<00:01:50.590> the<00:01:50.619> water<00:01:51.009> you<00:01:51.819> can<00:01:52.060> see<00:01:52.329> it<00:01:52.479> kind

00:01:52.739 --> 00:01:52.749 
floats in the water you can see it kind

00:01:52.749 --> 00:01:56.099 
floats in the water you can see it kind
of<00:01:52.840> takes<00:01:53.109> the<00:01:53.789> takes<00:01:54.789> the<00:01:55.090> movement<00:01:55.779> of<00:01:55.929> the

00:01:56.099 --> 00:01:56.109 
of takes the takes the movement of the

00:01:56.109 --> 00:01:58.679 
of takes the takes the movement of the
water<00:01:56.409> so<00:01:57.099> they<00:01:57.249> look<00:01:57.459> like<00:01:57.639> pieces<00:01:58.179> of<00:01:58.359> fabric

00:01:58.679 --> 00:01:58.689 
water so they look like pieces of fabric

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:02.730 
water so they look like pieces of fabric
almost<00:01:59.279> the<00:02:00.279> glass<00:02:00.579> panes<00:02:01.049> make<00:02:02.049> it<00:02:02.229> so<00:02:02.590> that

00:02:02.730 --> 00:02:02.740 
almost the glass panes make it so that

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.279 
almost the glass panes make it so that
they're<00:02:02.919> transparent<00:02:03.700> people<00:02:03.909> can<00:02:04.329> kind<00:02:05.139> of

00:02:05.279 --> 00:02:05.289 
they're transparent people can kind of

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:08.249 
they're transparent people can kind of
extract<00:02:05.709> their<00:02:05.950> own<00:02:06.099> meanings<00:02:06.700> from<00:02:07.389> from<00:02:08.110> the

00:02:08.249 --> 00:02:08.259 
extract their own meanings from from the

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:10.089 
extract their own meanings from from the
work<00:02:08.470> instead<00:02:09.280> of

00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:10.099 
work instead of

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:12.339 
work instead of
they're<00:02:10.579> necessarily<00:02:11.390> being<00:02:11.719> a<00:02:11.840> story<00:02:12.140> or

00:02:12.339 --> 00:02:12.349 
they're necessarily being a story or

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:14.800 
they're necessarily being a story or
there<00:02:12.500> is<00:02:12.650> a<00:02:12.890> story<00:02:13.459> for<00:02:13.700> me<00:02:13.879> but<00:02:14.299> it<00:02:14.480> kind<00:02:14.719> of
