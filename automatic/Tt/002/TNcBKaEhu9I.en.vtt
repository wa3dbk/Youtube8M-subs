00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
it and this gun is a horrible if they

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:42.550 
I guess when you're that close it
manages<00:02:40.640> to<00:02:40.820> and<00:02:41.390> I'm<00:02:42.230> getting<00:02:42.380> really

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
manages to and I'm getting really

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.560 
manages to and I'm getting really
anxious<00:02:42.890> right<00:02:43.220> here<00:02:43.490> because<00:02:43.790> I<00:02:43.970> like<00:02:44.270> to<00:02:44.300> see
