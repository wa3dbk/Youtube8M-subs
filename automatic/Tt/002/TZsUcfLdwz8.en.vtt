one<00:00:03.780> way<00:00:03.959> to<00:00:04.020> augment<00:00:04.830> your<00:00:05.549> three<00:00:05.910> stages<00:00:06.180> of

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.450 
one way to augment your three stages of

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.690 
one way to augment your three stages of
hitting<00:00:06.810> would<00:00:07.290> be<00:00:07.470> off<00:00:07.620> of<00:00:07.770> a<00:00:07.890> tee<00:00:08.130> so<00:00:08.460> that

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
hitting would be off of a tee so that

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.480 
hitting would be off of a tee so that
the<00:00:09.179> young<00:00:09.510> players<00:00:09.809> can<00:00:10.200> actually<00:00:10.769> start

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
the young players can actually start

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.999 
the young players can actually start
incorporating<00:00:12.450> what<00:00:12.960> they're<00:00:13.139> learning<00:00:13.320> with

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
incorporating what they're learning with

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:15.440 
incorporating what they're learning with
the<00:00:14.130> ball<00:00:14.309> that's<00:00:14.490> not<00:00:14.670> moving<00:00:15.059> so<00:00:15.210> that<00:00:15.240> they

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:15.450 
the ball that's not moving so that they

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:16.760 
the ball that's not moving so that they
don't<00:00:15.540> have<00:00:15.719> the<00:00:15.809> stress<00:00:16.109> of<00:00:16.260> the<00:00:16.350> ball<00:00:16.529> moving

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:16.770 
don't have the stress of the ball moving

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.400 
don't have the stress of the ball moving
we<00:00:17.310> do<00:00:17.490> this<00:00:17.640> with<00:00:17.850> the<00:00:17.940> tee<00:00:18.150> so<00:00:18.199> mariann<00:00:19.199> here

their bat around their head because it

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.830 
their bat around their head because it

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840 
causes their barrel to cast out and be

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.730 
causes their barrel to cast out and be
long<00:01:10.080> and<00:01:10.380> so<00:01:10.799> we<00:01:10.920> don't<00:01:11.010> want<00:01:11.189> to<00:01:11.250> train<00:01:11.520> that

00:01:12.730 --> 00:01:12.740 
long and so we don't want to train that

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.170 
long and so we don't want to train that
one<00:01:13.740> of<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:13.950> things<00:01:14.220> that's<00:01:14.729> important<00:01:15.119> to

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
one of the things that's important to

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.149 
one of the things that's important to
remember<00:01:15.299> off<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:15.840> tee<00:01:16.080> and<00:01:16.350> I<00:01:16.799> want<00:01:16.979> to<00:01:17.040> make

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
remember off the tee and I want to make

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:19.010 
remember off the tee and I want to make
sure<00:01:17.189> that<00:01:17.460> that<00:01:18.000> we<00:01:18.210> emphasize<00:01:18.390> this<00:01:18.960> because

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:19.020 
sure that that we emphasize this because

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.960 
sure that that we emphasize this because
we<00:01:19.320> do<00:01:19.500> all<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:19.799> time<00:01:19.830> is<00:01:20.400> when<00:01:20.850> you're

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
we do all the time is when you're

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.880 
we do all the time is when you're
working<00:01:21.119> with<00:01:21.360> a<00:01:21.720> tee<00:01:21.960> a<00:01:21.990> lot<00:01:22.350> of<00:01:22.470> times<00:01:22.680> the

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
working with a tee a lot of times the

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.830 
working with a tee a lot of times the
tee<00:01:23.070> will<00:01:23.280> be<00:01:23.369> here<00:01:23.700> in<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:24.420> middle<00:01:24.659> of<00:01:24.750> the

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
tee will be here in the middle of the

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.080 
tee will be here in the middle of the
plate<00:01:25.110> and<00:01:25.320> that's<00:01:25.860> really<00:01:26.220> an<00:01:26.490> improper

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
plate and that's really an improper

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.390 
plate and that's really an improper
place<00:01:27.360> to<00:01:27.659> contact<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.229> ball<00:01:28.380> so<00:01:29.009> it's

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:29.400 
place to contact the ball so it's

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:30.859 
place to contact the ball so it's
important<00:01:29.880> to<00:01:30.000> know<00:01:30.180> that<00:01:30.210> you've<00:01:30.600> got<00:01:30.840> it

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
important to know that you've got it

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.330 
important to know that you've got it
you've<00:01:31.350> got<00:01:31.380> to<00:01:31.619> have<00:01:31.740> a<00:01:31.770> tee

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
you've got to have a tee

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.740 
you've got to have a tee
you've<00:01:32.640> got<00:01:32.759> to<00:01:32.850> have<00:01:32.939> a<00:01:32.970> plate<00:01:33.210> and<00:01:33.420> a<00:01:33.509> tee<00:01:33.720> in

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
you've got to have a plate and a tee in

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.749 
you've got to have a plate and a tee in
front<00:01:34.170> or<00:01:34.409> wherever<00:01:34.740> your<00:01:35.070> contact<00:01:35.520> point<00:01:35.700> is

going<00:01:35.909> to<00:01:35.970> be<00:01:36.060> on<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.329> inside<00:01:36.450> it's<00:01:36.869> going<00:01:36.960> to

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
going to be on the inside it's going to

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.840 
going to be on the inside it's going to
be<00:01:37.170> further<00:01:37.380> out<00:01:37.500> and<00:01:37.920> on<00:01:38.220> the<00:01:38.310> outside<00:01:38.729> it's

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
be further out and on the outside it's

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.789 
be further out and on the outside it's
gonna<00:01:38.970> be<00:01:39.090> closer<00:01:39.329> to<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:39.689> plate<00:01:39.930> but<00:01:40.590> that's

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799 
gonna be closer to the plate but that's

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:42.109 
gonna be closer to the plate but that's
important<00:01:41.189> when<00:01:41.280> you're<00:01:41.400> working<00:01:41.430> tee<00:01:41.909> work
