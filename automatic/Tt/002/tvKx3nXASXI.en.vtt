00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:03.000
 ah 

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:06.740
 good guys that are very good 

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:08.540
 welcome a new video and just 

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:11.839
 pass a plane over my house I do not know 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:14.870
 if it is heard go to internal 

00:00:11.839 --> 00:00:16.370
 fail but good let's start already with 

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:17.770
 the gameplay or with the tutorial since 

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:20.420
 this is a tutorial of how to have 

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:23.810
 Minecraft and German carty commands without 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:26.539
 mods in may is so we go without that the 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:28.130
 break without any of that only the only thing that 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:31.460
 need in the application that 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:34.150
 flame plus is so let's go into 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:36.890
 gel had already made a video of this from 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:39.110
 how to get the table of what is the 

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:40.580
 iron door saddle 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.300
 good all this but now I'm going to do it 

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:45.250
 a little more complete as many do not 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:49.480
 they did not find out many and we're going to 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:51.430
 commands for commands and we're going to review 

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:54.970
 each of those commands and then to 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:56.770
 put them into practice so 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:58.600
 but first we start with this point 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:00.490
 cap that serves to kill the players 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.630
 that is, we put point here space and the 

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:04.239
 Player's name and we will kill him 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:06.100
 instantaneously it is something trap but the 

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:08.680
 it's really fun once 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:11.659
 it's a bit troll but you'll laugh a lot 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:15.649
 true that you know do it someone 

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:17.689
 point l that I think this serves us if 

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:20.119
 they serve some they serve us they are still in 

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:22.429
 phase as of test point and no I have not 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:24.649
 tried now we will prove it point I know that 

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:26.270
 are the coordinates to not miss you anymore 

00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:27.770
 that I am I am one of those who get lost 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.380
 very easily yes that 's perfect 

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:31.219
 for my point and here that is for 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.439
 commit suicide 

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:35.450
 I do not know if they serve point h which is for 

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:38.030
 give you life or to generate texts and 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:39.349
 what's the point if it's proven and point g already 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.340
 we try at once to form 

00:01:39.349 --> 00:01:45.039
 objects to give you like too many items 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.200
 point what is blocking coffers I guess 

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:50.109
 I have not tried it and atp point that serves 

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:52.450
 to transport us this they will already know 

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:55.869
 way that the cpc however this one does not 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:57.880
 we can prove it since I'm alone and 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:59.439
 no i 'm not multiplayer so i'm 

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.719
 alone here we are going to try only those of 

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:05.010
 a player so what we do will be 

00:02:01.719 --> 00:02:07.830
 leave this open and go to minecraft 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:09.540
 and we go to minecraft and enter one of 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:11.960
 our worlds must be our worlds 

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:14.700
 since if we enter a server or a 

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:17.250
 multiplayer will serve us should be a 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:18.810
 our world I have many worlds the 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.770
 I really do not know deleted I have servers 

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:22.610
 also so let's go into 

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:25.400
 any of these are all servers 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.690
 I have not erased them, well, we are going to 

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.340
 get in 

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.560
 to my word that I do not even have a 

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:33.330
 first name 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:35.690
 and now we wait and we are going to try 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:39.280
 clear if I load 

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:39.280
 of course let's go 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:46.640
 and then let's ally hope we 

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:48.470
 activated in the application because if not 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:52.240
 I came out in the chat with a statement 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:54.040
 Now I think we're going to try it 

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:56.410
 but it 's now let's serve ourselves yes 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.680
 exact if this is already active the 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.730
 the commands and it does not come out is that still not 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.100
 they have to open the application again 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.500
 I do not know I've had luck turned off late 

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:07.390
 but good and what we have to 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.030
 to do is go to the chat and put a point 

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:11.920
 this is to scan objects put a 

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:15.310
 number of the object that we can see it in 

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:17.770
 sometimes we will see it quickly we can see 

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:20.470
 here in there are temps we can see the number 

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:24.750
 of the object and well here comes the number 

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.750
 of the object and here it puts the point g 

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:28.390
 out 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:35.209
 it did not come out to me seriously then what 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:37.040
 said let's go to chad we put point g I'm going to 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:40.069
 lower the volume a little 

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:43.099
 we put point g the number of the object that 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:45.409
 will be going to put 50 that I think are 

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:47.239
 the space torches and we put the 

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:49.920
 number of antonio we want in this 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:51.780
 case I want I do not know 10 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:55.010
 and we give him space here he works a 

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:55.010
 little or no 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:59.269
 we have locked a serious good me the 

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:00.769
 They look like they look great if you can put 

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:03.470
 any type of object that is 

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:06.019
 minecraft up more like the chair of 

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:09.290
 ride and as I had said before and now 

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:11.690
 let's go with another command that is point c if 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:14.210
 I'm not wrong is the coordinates 

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:15.590
 Yes as you can see there is you get the 

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:17.540
 coordinates so you do not miss out like 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:18.590
 I already said I 'm not one of those who depend 

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:20.480
 very easily so that's 

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:24.410
 incredible for me for turbay worlds 

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:26.780
 bolt and see what else there was also in 

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:29.510
 point let's do a little damage 

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:30.890
 in case the authority to regenerate we are going to 

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:32.630
 throw us around here I think these are the 

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:34.340
 three that serve for now if they serve in 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:36.770
 way to a player because if we play at 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:39.650
 multiplayer will follow others as is the 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:41.870
 pp and the point here is to kill 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:44.810
 others that I have already seen how it works 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:46.820
 the auto life command that is h so 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:49.420
 let's try it let's go up the 

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:49.420
 enough 

00:04:52.149 --> 00:04:57.639
 enough to prove these that 

00:04:55.429 --> 00:04:59.199
 let's go up there 

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:01.960
 if we look from here supposedly 

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:03.909
 we would take our lives here we had good 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:08.669
 a heart or mediocre are however if 

00:05:03.909 --> 00:05:11.319
 we put this and we put point ah sorry 

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:14.409
 we put a point to our name or the 

00:05:11.319 --> 00:05:16.200
 name of any the player h 

00:05:14.409 --> 00:05:18.129
 i 

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:20.770
 this 

00:05:18.129 --> 00:05:22.569
 we will have our self - life means that 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:25.179
 it does not regenerate life no no we can not 

00:05:22.569 --> 00:05:28.089
 come we have as invincibility let's 

00:05:25.179 --> 00:05:29.379
 let's jump and it took our hearts away 

00:05:28.089 --> 00:05:32.050
 principle but afterwards it does not regenerate 

00:05:29.379 --> 00:05:33.729
 very fast this is great, so 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:35.439
 these are the commands that I'm going to talk about 

00:05:33.729 --> 00:05:36.999
 or show for now the thing is that 

00:05:35.439 --> 00:05:39.069
 you prove it if you want us 

00:05:36.999 --> 00:05:42.459
 listen at all so I hope that you 

00:05:39.069 --> 00:05:44.169
 Help this tutorial a lot and tell me 

00:05:42.459 --> 00:05:45.699
 in the comment box obviously and 

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:47.229
 how have I done with that application like this 

00:05:45.699 --> 00:05:49.709
 what a greeting and until next time 

00:05:47.229 --> 00:05:49.709
 goodbye
