this<00:00:04.130> summit<00:00:04.430> is<00:00:04.520> my<00:00:04.700> ipad<00:00:04.939> mini<00:00:05.149> on<00:00:05.240> the<00:00:05.359> left

00:00:05.559 --> 00:00:05.569 
this summit is my ipad mini on the left

00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:07.599 
this summit is my ipad mini on the left
and<00:00:06.109> the<00:00:06.169> ipad<00:00:06.620> 4th<00:00:06.830> dimension<00:00:07.220> on<00:00:07.339> the<00:00:07.430> right

00:00:07.599 --> 00:00:07.609 
and the ipad 4th dimension on the right

00:00:07.609 --> 00:00:09.730 
and the ipad 4th dimension on the right
so<00:00:08.390> I<00:00:08.420> already<00:00:08.570> got<00:00:08.750> Infinity<00:00:09.230> Blade<00:00:09.380> 2

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:09.740 
so I already got Infinity Blade 2

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:12.040 
so I already got Infinity Blade 2
already<00:00:10.160> load<00:00:10.460> it<00:00:10.580> up<00:00:10.730> and<00:00:10.940> let's<00:00:11.480> see<00:00:11.690> which

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:12.050 
already load it up and let's see which

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:34.120 
already load it up and let's see which
one<00:00:12.290> starts<00:00:12.560> quicker<00:00:12.980> 1<00:00:13.850> 2<00:00:14.450> 3

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:34.130 

00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:37.180 

so<00:00:34.760> it<00:00:35.270> does<00:00:35.510> look<00:00:35.720> like<00:00:35.840> the<00:00:35.990> ipad<00:00:36.320> mini<00:00:36.350> did

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:37.190 
so it does look like the ipad mini did

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.770 
so it does look like the ipad mini did
win<00:00:37.870> but<00:00:38.870> it<00:00:38.990> just<00:00:39.170> might<00:00:39.350> have<00:00:39.500> been<00:00:39.590> me

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:40.780 
win but it just might have been me

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:46.510 
win but it just might have been me
pushing<00:00:42.790> touching<00:00:43.790> it<00:00:44.560> first<00:00:45.560> but<00:00:45.920> we<00:00:46.250> can<00:00:46.430> do

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:46.520 
pushing touching it first but we can do

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:51.940 
pushing touching it first but we can do
it<00:00:46.550> one<00:00:46.700> more<00:00:46.760> time<00:00:46.880> we'll<00:00:47.270> see<00:00:48.310> so<00:00:50.170> one<00:00:51.170> two

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:51.950 
it one more time we'll see so one two

00:00:51.950 --> 00:01:12.149 
it one more time we'll see so one two
three

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:12.159 

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:15.069 

yeah<00:01:13.159> so<00:01:13.430> it<00:01:13.520> is<00:01:13.640> about<00:01:13.850> even<00:01:14.210> it<00:01:14.450> so<00:01:14.689> much<00:01:14.869> of<00:01:14.990> a

00:01:15.069 --> 00:01:15.079 
yeah so it is about even it so much of a

00:01:15.079 --> 00:01:18.760 
yeah so it is about even it so much of a
difference<00:01:16.329> so<00:01:17.329> we'll<00:01:17.630> just<00:01:17.659> go<00:01:17.960> back<00:01:18.530> out<00:01:18.740> of

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:18.770 
difference so we'll just go back out of

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:21.490 
difference so we'll just go back out of
this<00:01:18.950> clear<00:01:19.549> both<00:01:19.820> of<00:01:20.000> these<00:01:20.090> and<00:01:21.079> we'll<00:01:21.229> load

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
this clear both of these and we'll load

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:26.469 
this clear both of these and we'll load
up<00:01:21.560> the<00:01:22.369> verge<00:01:24.100> com<00:01:25.100> so<00:01:25.850> they<00:01:25.970> are<00:01:26.119> that<00:01:26.299> would

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:26.479 
up the verge com so they are that would

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:34.419 
up the verge com so they are that would
work<00:01:27.439> some<00:01:27.710> breath<00:01:27.920> devices<00:01:31.689> so<00:01:32.860> I'll<00:01:33.860> refresh

00:01:34.419 --> 00:01:34.429 
work some breath devices so I'll refresh

00:01:34.429 --> 00:01:45.630 
work some breath devices so I'll refresh
the<00:01:34.640> pages<00:01:35.500> one<00:01:36.500> two<00:01:37.310> three

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:45.640 

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.700 

so<00:01:46.210> it<00:01:46.270> looks<00:01:46.300> like<00:01:46.479> the<00:01:46.690> ipad<00:01:46.960> 4th<00:01:47.320> direction

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:47.710 
so it looks like the ipad 4th direction

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:54.030 
so it looks like the ipad 4th direction
did<00:01:47.800> win<00:01:48.090> let's<00:01:49.090> check<00:01:51.630> pinch<00:01:52.630> and<00:01:52.810> zoom<00:01:53.040> no

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:54.040 
did win let's check pinch and zoom no

00:01:54.040 --> 00:02:02.660 
did win let's check pinch and zoom no
lag<00:01:54.340> at<00:01:54.369> all<00:01:58.440> but<00:01:59.440> you<00:01:59.530> can<00:01:59.710> see<00:01:59.920> the<00:02:00.070> retina

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:08.219 

display<00:02:03.670> much<00:02:04.330> clearer<00:02:06.180> but<00:02:07.180> the<00:02:07.930> ipad<00:02:08.200> mini

00:02:08.219 --> 00:02:08.229 
display much clearer but the ipad mini

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:11.190 
display much clearer but the ipad mini
display<00:02:08.740> is<00:02:08.800> still<00:02:09.160> nice<00:02:09.820> all<00:02:10.570> right<00:02:10.690> let's<00:02:10.990> go

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:11.200 
display is still nice all right let's go

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.000 
display is still nice all right let's go
to<00:02:11.260> maps<00:02:12.100> and<00:02:12.400> see<00:02:12.489> which<00:02:12.640> one<00:02:12.790> load<00:02:12.970> skipper<00:02:14.010> 1

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.010 
to maps and see which one load skipper 1

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:21.420 
to maps and see which one load skipper 1
2<00:02:15.730> 3<00:02:17.940> so<00:02:18.940> you<00:02:19.000> get<00:02:19.690> again<00:02:20.260> the<00:02:20.860> i<00:02:20.920> post<00:02:21.190> for

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
2 3 so you get again the i post for

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:25.259 
2 3 so you get again the i post for
actually<00:02:21.820> did<00:02:21.970> win<00:02:22.150> but<00:02:22.630> it's<00:02:23.380> only<00:02:23.530> by<00:02:24.180> just<00:02:25.180> a

00:02:25.259 --> 00:02:25.269 
actually did win but it's only by just a

00:02:25.269 --> 00:02:28.550 
actually did win but it's only by just a
small<00:02:25.720> margin<00:02:25.930> so<00:02:26.739> it's<00:02:26.890> clear<00:02:27.100> both<00:02:27.280> of<00:02:27.430> these

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:28.560 
small margin so it's clear both of these

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.610 
small margin so it's clear both of these
and<00:02:29.560> we'll<00:02:29.650> launch<00:02:29.890> the<00:02:30.100> apple<00:02:30.340> store<00:02:30.430> app

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:31.620 
and we'll launch the apple store app

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.110 
and we'll launch the apple store app
store<00:02:32.620> sorry<00:02:32.890> and<00:02:33.160> we'll<00:02:33.459> see<00:02:33.610> which<00:02:33.730> one<00:02:33.940> wins

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
store sorry and we'll see which one wins

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:49.340 
store sorry and we'll see which one wins
so<00:02:34.980> one<00:02:35.980> two<00:02:36.670> three

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:49.350 

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:53.200 

so<00:02:49.980> the<00:02:50.070> ipad<00:02:50.430> mini<00:02:50.690> lost<00:02:51.690> again<00:02:52.560> but<00:02:52.800> it<00:02:52.950> only

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:53.210 
so the ipad mini lost again but it only

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:56.750 
so the ipad mini lost again but it only
stopped<00:02:54.210> by<00:02:54.390> a<00:02:54.420> huge<00:02:54.750> margin<00:02:54.780> so<00:02:55.520> it's<00:02:56.520> not

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:56.760 
stopped by a huge margin so it's not

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.490 
stopped by a huge margin so it's not
that<00:02:56.940> bad<00:02:57.120> so<00:02:57.600> it<00:02:57.750> will<00:02:57.930> clear<00:02:58.110> both<00:02:58.290> of<00:02:58.410> these

00:02:58.490 --> 00:02:58.500 
that bad so it will clear both of these

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.820 
that bad so it will clear both of these
and<00:02:58.710> we'll<00:02:58.770> do<00:02:58.890> a<00:02:58.950> reboot<00:02:59.370> test<00:02:59.670> and<00:03:00.830> yes

00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:01.830 
and we'll do a reboot test and yes

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:11.870 
and we'll do a reboot test and yes
alright<00:03:02.340> so<00:03:03.530> its<00:03:04.530> current<00:03:05.010> here

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:11.880 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:19.270 

Scott<00:03:12.630> tough

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:39.600 

so<00:03:19.850> let's<00:03:20.330> do<00:03:20.569> a<00:03:20.600> reboot<00:03:20.930> test<00:03:21.230> right

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:39.610 

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:41.370 

so<00:03:40.210> does<00:03:40.360> look<00:03:40.510> like<00:03:40.630> the<00:03:40.780> iPad<00:03:41.110> filtration

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:41.380 
so does look like the iPad filtration

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:45.300 
so does look like the iPad filtration
did<00:03:41.890> win<00:03:42.070> and<00:03:42.960> there<00:03:43.960> it<00:03:44.110> is<00:03:44.200> so<00:03:44.500> took<00:03:45.190> that

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310 
did win and there it is so took that

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:47.310 
did win and there it is so took that
much<00:03:45.520> of<00:03:45.730> a<00:03:45.790> difference<00:03:45.820> it's<00:03:46.780> a<00:03:46.840> bit<00:03:46.990> quicker

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:47.320 
much of a difference it's a bit quicker

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:51.240 
much of a difference it's a bit quicker
the<00:03:47.440> ipad<00:03:47.710> 4<00:03:47.980> but<00:03:48.610> not<00:03:48.790> that<00:03:48.910> much<00:03:49.350> so<00:03:50.350> guys<00:03:50.980> if

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:51.250 
the ipad 4 but not that much so guys if
