00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.470
 the next dish for this dinner in the 

00:00:02.379 --> 00:00:07.209
 that you want to show off the truth is 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:11.890
 extremely easy the star is the 

00:00:07.209 --> 00:00:15.080
 spectacular product 

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:18.410
 ingredients that we need very garlic 

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:20.990
 generous with the garlic remove a little 

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.730
 oil the oil will be let 's say 

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:25.160
 the times of the liquid medium that goes to 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.510
 allow to do the theft on a tablet to 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:30.230
 that this first time they have a lot 

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:31.640
 we're going to add rosemary now 

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:34.340
 let's put another aromatic herb that 

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:37.210
 it also combines wonderfully well and 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:37.210
 I mean the thyme 

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:42.710
 I'm putting mustard powder now 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:45.620
 we add pepper to pepper 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:48.980
 generous with the pepper we throw 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:50.420
 now salt grain we repeat with the 

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:53.000
 oil the kind of oil that I am 

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:55.280
 using this time is oil 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.230
 Olive will give great flavor 

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:59.300
 course to the marinade 

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:01.690
 a little bit of onion, let's liquefy 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.690
 all 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:10.220
 stellar player he is the one who puts the 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.400
 goals must be covered perfectly 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.400
 all right 

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:24.220
 let's go with the tray for the oven 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:26.800
 to give a little height to my first 

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:29.290
 book that I do is that I cut some 

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.580
 slices of potatoes and this what is going to 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:33.190
 is that is going to give height is to say 

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:34.630
 the bottom of our prime is not going 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:37.290
 to touch the tray directly 

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:40.290
 we remove a little pepper the potatoes 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.290
 oil 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:45.780
 touch of rosemary because I repeat these 

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:45.780
 we are going to use them 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:52.020
 the star of the number 10 goes for 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:02:00.900
 up to life furnace temperature 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:03.810
 initially 240 degrees centigrade what 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:06.990
 you leave it for 20 minutes , cover it with paper 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:09.540
 aluminum and about an hour per 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:12.590
 each kilo must be in to 180 

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:14.420
 degrees you will feel like gamarra 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.910
 this first baby is a true 

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:19.020
 delight 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:21.540
 remember to let rest at least 15 to 20 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.520
 minutes before cutting it that's going to 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:25.970
 allow cubes to return to 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.970
 center 

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:32.590
 start serving a little of the mash the 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.590
 chips I had mentioned 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:43.410
 sprinkle with a little puree onion 

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:43.410
 although now we are going with the tractor 

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:49.080
 I would take it to the table directly on 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:52.010
 the coral table or with a bit of 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.010
 fresh rosemary 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:57.280
 above touch of grain salt 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.790
 and it's finished
