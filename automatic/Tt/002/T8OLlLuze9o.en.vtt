00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:12.649
 again during the dissident 

00:00:12.649 --> 00:00:16.839
 they returned to photograph objects very close to the sun thanks to the 

00:00:16.839 --> 00:00:19.060
 space telescopes 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:21.560
 that has the earth that has the nasa 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:24.800
 it was possible to detect these objects that must be almost the size 

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:27.140
 of a planet 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.849
 the images are amazing 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.849
 the investigation in alevines with fernando correa 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.960
 During the year of 2010 several flying objects were observed. 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:39.190
 they made the sun fall 

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:43.400
 it has been confirmed that it is not artificial satellites either of the 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.410
 international space station and there are defects in the sensors of the 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:51.800
 space telescopes therefore these UFOs should be investigated 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.130
 deeply in the face of the possibility that cubicle objects from other 

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:59.530
 civilizations that are using our star as 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:01.110
 conveyance 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:06.030
 on December 30, 2010 at two hours with 46 minutes time aboard the 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.040
 stereo space telescope was caught a strange object whose origin does not have 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.050
 conventional explanation 

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:15.890
 spokesman of the carefully 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.760
 they are not perfect or pixels that could confuse otherwise 

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:25.850
 about a genuine image of NASA, the presence of 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.440
 other objects like the nobleman who registered with the soy telescope and who 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.440
 appears in this image dated November 8, 2010 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.090
 in this broad citation its peculiar form is noted 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:43.420
 now you both look closely at this huge pyramidal UFO that appeared 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:48.310
 very close to the sun moments after a powerful solar explosion suddenly 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.450
 in the image with green filter was clearly recorded 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.450
 the shape of this unknown body 

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:00.930
 this image was captured on October 7, 2010 with the instruments of the 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:06.070
 Sojo telescope of this mysterious pyramid is also inexplicable 

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:11.540
 on February 1, 2010 in london england the astronomer 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:12.239
 malcom 

00:02:12.239 --> 00:02:17.569
 art record in videos and photographs the passage of an object that does not correspond with 

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:20.429
 the orbit of an artificial satellite 

00:02:20.429 --> 00:02:25.299
 I watched carefully as the unknown object passes through the disk 

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:27.729
 solar from the front 

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:32.269
 in this application you see the sprinter are of the mysterious percent 

00:02:34.499 --> 00:02:39.149
 this man was also caught in a photograph with special filter cache 

00:02:39.149 --> 00:02:40.419
 hike in the shot 

00:02:40.419 --> 00:02:44.669
 the trajectory of the object that was captured with exposure was recorded 

00:02:44.669 --> 00:02:49.859
 multiple up to 51 times that are the dark circles representing the 

00:02:49.859 --> 00:02:52.879
 positions of the unknown object 

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:57.379
 some suggested that it was the international space station which 

00:02:57.379 --> 00:03:01.609
 it is impossible the shape of the space station is well known by the 

00:03:01.609 --> 00:03:06.829
 astronomers as in this image captured during the partial solar eclipse of 4 

00:03:06.829 --> 00:03:08.359
 January 2011 

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:13.579
 or in this shot of May 22, 2010 in which the space station appears 

00:03:13.579 --> 00:03:18.290
 and to the left the atlantis ferry whose silhouettes also very 

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:19.279
 known 

00:03:19.279 --> 00:03:24.109
 so this picture menghi this video our not an object that 

00:03:24.109 --> 00:03:27.489
 It has not yet been possible to identify 

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:32.290
 now both erbes with all care this image that show agÃ©nor month 

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:35.009
 spherical objects very close to the sun 

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:37.419
 objects that look metallic 

00:03:37.419 --> 00:03:42.079
 and that highlights the same distance from the sun should measure thousands of kilometers 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:48.399
 This image of NASA was stopped on January 18, 2010 at 5 o'clock 

00:03:48.399 --> 00:03:51.279
 aboard the twin telescopes outside 

00:03:51.279 --> 00:03:56.239
 days after the image was removed from the archives of the nasa are treated 

00:03:56.239 --> 00:04:00.469
 evidence of unknown objects that could be related to the existence 

00:04:00.469 --> 00:04:03.689
 of the magnificent portals between the sun and the earth 

00:04:03.689 --> 00:04:08.329
 through these material portals the sun reaches the earth in almost 

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:12.579
 snapshot of these portals that have been observed by the works the certain 

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:15.479
 is that they are accepted by scientists as the doctor of 

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:20.269
 The nation's exhibitions are portals that could have a direct relationship with 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:25.479
 the presence of the mysterious UFOs that during 2010 appeared very 

00:04:25.479 --> 00:04:28.479
 near our star 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.780
 mysterious objects continue to appear very close to the sun 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:36.910
 that you see images of space telescopes 

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:40.930
 and NASA still has no explanation 

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:42.809
 about these young people 

00:04:42.809 --> 00:04:44.850
 reports for the third millennium 

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:45.700
