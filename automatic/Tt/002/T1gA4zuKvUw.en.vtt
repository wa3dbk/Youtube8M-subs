00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:15.090
 the world of drag cranes from 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:18.210
 light load will never be the 

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:20.340
 A designed vehicle has been born 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.650
 made by jordan the company with the 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.050
 vision the dexterity and the plant 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.960
 necessary to start a 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:29.880
 revolution 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:33.320
 presentation of the towing crane ml 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.320
 40 Ivy 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:39.400
 the m-40 is the perfect tool for 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.770
 trailer to reign on the asphalt 

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:43.450
 has a wide range of features that 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:44.520
 make it ideal for any operation 

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:48.460
 light load 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:50.110
 we go first with the visibility the 

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.750
 view from the cabin on the head 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:54.520
 it's fantastic is a fabulous hole 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:56.500
 between the pen and the body to see with 

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:59.350
 accuracy how is moving the 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:01.390
 Telescopic fork thus wins time in 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:03.750
 each maneuver and minimizes possible damage 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:07.420
 to the fork and the vehicle has assisted 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:09.190
 jordan has endowed the ml 40 of one of 

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:11.560
 the lower profile forks of the 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:14.350
 market with the pen in its position 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:17.290
 natural has about 11.5 centimeters 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:19.149
 of profile for the head so you can 

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:21.700
 get into the lows of any 

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:23.740
 luxury car or sports car without risk 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:27.369
 of damaging your bumpers or protections 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:29.590
 also the mp l 40 has a function of 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:31.690
 negative tilt for vehicles in 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:34.780
 pending maybe one of the aspects 

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:37.060
 most extraordinary of the mp l 40 be the 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.490
 versatility of your lift ride with 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:42.040
 multitude of possible configurations 

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.780
 a mechanism of 90 degrees that allows 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:47.759
 take cars out of positions that up 

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:47.759
 now they were considered impossible 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.040
 he also has manual arms on him and 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.440
 a rescue pen with eight tons 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:58.509
 of capacity which allows it to effect 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:02.460
 more rescues in multiple circumstances 

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:02.460
 and gives it a comparative advantage 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:08.800
 The ml series incorporates as a new option 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:11.260
 a transport system for mopeds 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.330
 that allows a single operator to load and 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:16.270
 transport mopeds safely 

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:18.640
 Its lightness adaptability and ease of 

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:21.640
 hooking make this system a trait 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:24.540
 from which your cranes lose series ml no 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.540
 they can do without 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.250
 cylinders are anderlecht 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.400
 protected to prevent wear 

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.870
 abuse and prolong the longevity 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.700
 cylinders form a whole with the 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.380
 anderlecht so they are safe from 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:39.600
 the area of â€‹â€‹work and friction with the 

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:43.400
 chassis and you enjoy more visibility 

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.400
 about the under live and the pen 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.980
 the under leaf also has a mechanism 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.349
 Adjustable auto friction-centered 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:54.430
 that is interesting as the 

00:02:51.349 --> 00:02:54.430
 enter under the vehicle 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:03:00.010
 at the 40 yard the details mark the 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:02.450
 difference 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.770
 the dry joints of the axles 

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.330
 they will save maintenance costs 

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:08.820
 throughout the life of the machine 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:10.680
 thanks to its design the anderlecht 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:12.450
 maintains an ideal distance from 

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:14.910
 floor so as not to damage the 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:17.100
 towed vehicle especially the crankcase 

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:19.170
 of oil and in the large boxes of 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:22.650
 Side tools fit well all 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:25.380
 his utensils the engineers of jordan 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:27.690
 they have also endowed the mp l 40 with a 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.820
 series of security functions 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:33.030
 the retention wheel of the arms 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:34.800
 has block link an auto mechanism 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:37.440
 automatic centering blocker 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:39.330
 attack and that holds the arms of 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:41.820
 under lead in the pneumatic position 

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:44.490
 required to prevent a decoupling in 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:46.410
 case of hydraulic failure is required 

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:50.510
 hydraulic power to power the 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:50.510
 mechanism and release the tires 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:57.319
 jordan has thought about every detail the 

00:03:55.069 --> 00:03:59.420
 body to be reinforced aluminum is 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:02.150
 lighter reduces the wear of the 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:05.060
 housing that you choose and revokes more weight with 

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:08.180
 the crane itself is more resistant to 

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:10.130
 the corrosion that the steel part 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:11.780
 lower body is protected from 

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:14.390
 elements and the asphalt with slopes 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:16.609
 integrated we have thought up the 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:18.859
 location of the wing whose position is 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:21.079
 lower than the pen but not the 

00:04:18.859 --> 00:04:23.780
 of the body so that the cable remains 

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:26.790
 tense and firm even when the pen is 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:28.770
 find in movement 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:30.870
 all body parts and pen 

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:33.120
 have been painted separately before your 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:35.520
 assembly so all surfaces 

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:37.830
 they are safe from the elements last longer 

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:40.530
 the body and its good appearance is preserved 

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:42.240
 This modular design also has 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:45.270
 The advantage of providing spare parts 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:47.070
 extractions and substitutions saves 

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:49.590
 time and long maintenance costs 

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:51.600
 most important deadline still saves you 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:54.810
 inactive time everything we have 

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:57.060
 incorporated into ml 40 is to save you 

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:59.490
 time in each maneuver and that renews the 

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:01.320
 work is designed so that up 

00:04:59.490 --> 00:05:03.900
 a novice can handle it 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:06.030
 quick and simple does much more than 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:08.450
 that could never be expected from a crane 

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:08.450
 drag 

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:14.240
 reign over the assault with the mp l 40 of 

00:05:11.819 --> 00:05:14.240
 iata
