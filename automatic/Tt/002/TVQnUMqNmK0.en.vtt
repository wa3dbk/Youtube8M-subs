00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:01.400 
right here just for to make sure that no

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:06.880 
right here just for to make sure that no
wires<00:05:01.910> and<00:05:02.300> separating<00:05:03.760> yeah<00:05:05.470> here<00:05:06.470> you<00:05:06.680> just

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:06.890 
wires and separating yeah here you just

00:05:06.890 --> 00:05:12.880 
wires and separating yeah here you just
add<00:05:07.400> a<00:05:07.460> little<00:05:08.090> wall<00:05:08.480> or<00:05:08.810> something<00:05:11.710> and<00:05:12.710> I
