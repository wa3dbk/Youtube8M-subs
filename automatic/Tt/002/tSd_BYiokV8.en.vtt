00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:05.020
 good your fears still did not live good 154 

00:00:03.219 --> 00:00:06.100
 it is accessible that favorite these hours 

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:08.590
 often done a lot and encourages a lot 

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:10.360
 as I always say and good seems to be 

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:12.280
 that seeps the new black tepes 

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:14.860
 ops 3 possibly I do not know yet 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:16.299
 for now they are supposedly rumor the 

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:19.120
 source would be the same one that leaked 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:21.760
 a lot of things about black ops 2 and atino 

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:23.890
 quite the truth to lie but 

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:27.190
 I see her sincerely detailed that is 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:28.869
 that I doubt that it is real in certain 

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:31.420
 sense you also have to think that the 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:34.300
 game has been three years with this 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:35.739
 in development and they are more that are more years 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.539
 that the previous out tuti and it's normal 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:39.399
 that leaked relationship before though 

00:00:37.539 --> 00:00:42.489
 as I say then you have to be careful 

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:43.870
 because even this is more false than 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:46.960
 the cocks because they have leaked all 

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:48.729
 weapons and others so I do not know hesitated a 

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.170
 little of its reliability but good there will be 

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:52.239
 what to expect as always are the 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.829
 rumors you have to fuck in me like 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:56.710
 I always say if the source seems to me 

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:58.299
 reliable one thousand percent as you get that 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.489
 90 percent chance of it being 

00:00:58.299 --> 00:01:03.579
 true but in this case we can only 

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:05.560
 say a 50 to a yes or no and it's already good 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:06.640
 its development would take place from 2030 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.260
 good 070 because 

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.760
 the information of zombies and of 

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.800
 multiplayer and others for now we're going to 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:14.350
 start with the story will go on in 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:16.750
 2030 and those of the game would tell us how 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:19.540
 around as around the world the 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:21.010
 people have rebelled against their 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.229
 governments blaming imperialism 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:24.720
 American for his suffering the 

00:01:23.229 --> 00:01:28.119
 organization of the treatment 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.590
 multinationals known as mmt or is 

00:01:28.119 --> 00:01:31.420
 a military and political coalition 

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.550
 Economic created to combat 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:35.350
 influence of the West its members are 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:36.820
 Main mainly countries 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.960
 of the good third world we must say that 

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.910
 you have an information also in the 

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.070
 description in case you do not want the law 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:43.720
 others we have been translating between 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:46.420
 john and I a little bit because all the 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:48.220
 information and others in which several 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.110
 days by the network by a hundred by the way but 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.910
 well, it 's something old too, 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.770
 you have listened although it is not 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:55.539
 capacity the action that would elapse 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.280
 between a coalition of countries against 

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:59.380
 us a new song what they choose 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.850
 located between the border of mexico and the 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.580
 country of opportunities 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.610
 the rebels get to destroy us and 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:08.229
 they end up murdering more than 70 million 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.450
 of Americans of your form part of the 

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:13.209
 ebx group or they have to stop this 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:17.000
 it's even barbarian 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:21.109
 previously they put soldiers like that 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.180
 that time is implants to be 

00:02:21.109 --> 00:02:25.640
 best examples maybe an arm by 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:27.650
 a mechanical or robotic arm to make 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.409
 maybe it 's good to increase your 

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:32.060
 capabilities increases in the word the 

00:02:30.409 --> 00:02:35.959
 weapons follow the following rifle is

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:45.470
 as you see many desire of different 

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:46.639
 caloto test and also with which I do not 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:49.549
 I know if this is going to be true or false 

00:02:46.639 --> 00:02:54.079

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:39.860
 can 15 15 the mechanics do not tell us 

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:42.770
 that the rumors say that there will be 

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:44.690
 a kind of exo costume more focused on 

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:47.210
 that they make us to resist more 

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:48.560
 catastrophes like radiation pollution 

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:51.290
 and else 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.550
 well then basically because that is 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:54.319
 would have associated with a manufacturer of 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:56.060
 weapons is in the real to do more 

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:58.880
 real that the weapons never and 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:00.290
 accessories and both the game and adjust 

00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:01.760
 the gun prices of the game to a 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:04.269
 level as if they were good 

00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:06.800
 buying in real life then also 

00:04:04.269 --> 00:04:08.540
 graphics would you use a graphic engine 

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:10.099
 more powerful than they used it to add 

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:12.140
 ferb or not obviously, you have to go 

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:13.760
 improving as always allowing then 

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:16.519
 good graphics improved and again from 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:18.919
 new frames 60 frames per second 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:21.019
 some blur that blur effect of 

00:04:18.919 --> 00:04:22.370
 movement that good they will call the 

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:24.650
 attention the rapid movements that do not 

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:26.600
 will propose the game then also the 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:28.100
 multiplayer in customization 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.050
 return to be important any the 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:31.669
 week for square fer and camouflages 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:33.680
 you can use the different parts of 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:35.240
 the character's kit will return to 

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:36.710
 mode of games of previous deliveries 

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:39.680
 from what I've seen there were quite a few 

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:42.440
 ways like the previous karting 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:44.720
 nothing new and good the game war 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:46.220
 terrestrial has been totally predefined 

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:49.610
 and now all the maps will allow 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:51.470
 combats of 20 versus 20 a fine each 

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:53.680
 pump would return the kinematics where 

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:56.380
 explode 

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:57.639
 a reactor or similar event and in all 

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:59.440
 the maps would occur in events 

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:00.970
 randomly before starting the games 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:03.130
 would also occur in events such as 

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:04.750
 descending by parachute or breaking a 

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:06.370
 door thus eliminating the typical account 

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:08.380
 back with his he had quite the truth 

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:10.539
 that has a way to advance quite 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:12.430
 as we have seen in other games 

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:13.810
 there would also be new accessories for 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:15.340
 the weapons of some of the current 

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:16.960
 will remain unchanged as to 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:18.759
 remaining point 5 and virginia not new 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:21.910
 called evo file what would be the 

00:05:18.759 --> 00:05:24.370
 supposed hidden streak that would allow us 

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:27.370
 since the enemy system of form 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:28.870
 that would allow us not to allow 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:30.849
 immobilize them to enemies languages 

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:32.770
 for a few seconds so good 

00:05:30.849 --> 00:05:35.440
 eliminate the friend fire ban 

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:37.030
 and tessitura as hostile to members 

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:39.840
 from your own team so good will be 

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:41.770
 a quite powerful cultural overcoming 

00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:43.180
 we can more I imagine that they will stay 

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:45.910
 unemployed of the enemy team and others and 

00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:49.139
 well we can kill them without you 

00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:49.139
 oppose the resistance and others 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:53.830
 why 

00:05:51.129 --> 00:05:57.159
 fire friend and others and good I do not know very 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:59.169
 well how did they live neither explained very 

00:05:57.159 --> 00:06:00.729
 well then you also form the zombie mode 

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:02.050
 being a mix between black ops 2 and 

00:06:00.729 --> 00:06:03.309
 for warfare was the initial mode 

00:06:02.050 --> 00:06:05.199
 would go on in the basement of a 

00:06:03.309 --> 00:06:07.809
 destroyed new york and it contained us of 

00:06:05.199 --> 00:06:08.979
 background the story of good I 'm not going to what 

00:06:07.809 --> 00:06:10.209
 I'm going to reveal nothing just in case 

00:06:08.979 --> 00:06:12.399
 you know the history of the ancients 

00:06:10.209 --> 00:06:14.589
 zombies is good it would happen at events 

00:06:12.399 --> 00:06:16.119
 randomly we value the games so 

00:06:14.589 --> 00:06:19.089
 ensures that the map would be longer than 

00:06:16.119 --> 00:06:21.459
 transit we would move from a car 

00:06:19.089 --> 00:06:23.199
 metro also read with the good in 

00:06:21.459 --> 00:06:25.779
 the accessories would also be purchased 

00:06:23.199 --> 00:06:27.189
 the walls and so on like the weapons like that 

00:06:25.779 --> 00:06:29.469
 that good we would also have accessories 

00:06:27.189 --> 00:06:31.959
 and all this for now, well, it's a 

00:06:29.469 --> 00:06:33.550
 filtration is not known if it is true if it is 

00:06:31.959 --> 00:06:36.189
 false as I always say, you have to 

00:06:33.550 --> 00:06:37.959
 wait you do not know anything until until 

00:06:36.189 --> 00:06:40.809
 that we do not have it in our hands 

00:06:37.959 --> 00:06:42.669
 obviously and good in many of the 

00:06:40.809 --> 00:06:44.439
 rumors because nothing appears 

00:06:42.669 --> 00:06:46.269
 crazy others like saying 

00:06:44.439 --> 00:06:48.369
 specifically weapons because yes I 

00:06:46.269 --> 00:06:50.309
 it seems pretty crazy to do it and 

00:06:48.369 --> 00:06:53.979
 I think you massive information 

00:06:50.309 --> 00:06:56.199
 where we are we did not even get to 

00:06:53.979 --> 00:06:58.250
 may we already have all this I do not know if 

00:06:56.199 --> 00:07:00.750
 It will be true as I say 

00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:02.040
 I could rely on calling more time 

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:03.990
 Batch development more expensive tuttis 

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:05.490
 emotion in the case of password do that 

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:07.650
 it also leaked much earlier many 

00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:09.870
 things but I do not know how I say there are 

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:11.640
 wait and not know anything else and generates 

00:07:09.870 --> 00:07:13.350
 ticos remember that the insane if 

00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:16.430
 we will have a trailer and nothing we go in the 

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:16.430
 next video until next time
