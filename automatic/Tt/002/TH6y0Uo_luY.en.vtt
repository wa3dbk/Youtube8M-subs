00:00:06.399 --> 00:00:11.139
One of Earth’s few landforms visible from
space, the Grand Canyon of the Colorado River

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:18.139
slices through 277 miles of Northwestern Arizona.
While there are certainly deeper canyons,

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:24.140
no where else on Earth has width, depth and
length combined in such a way as to produce

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:31.140
anything quite like this breathtaking chasm.
Over the course of 6 billion years, the canyon

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:38.390
has been carved by the Colorado River. A mile
deep, 277 miles long, and up to 18 miles wide,

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:45.519
this canyon is like none other.

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:50.040
Grand Canyon begins at Lees Ferry, which is
where river runners today start their rafting

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:55.580
adventure down the Colorado River. Here, the
first of Grand Canyon’s many rock layers

00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:02.580
is exposed. At 270 million years in age, the
whitish-gray Kaibab Limestone is the youngest

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.240
in a series of layered sedimentary rocks,
each emerging as the river carves its way

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:15.240
deeper into the Colorado Plateau.

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:24.030
Entering on the left we see the Little Colorado
River. At this point the main Colorado River

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.350
turns west, carving through the Kaibab Uplift,
exposing both the reddish pink Supergroup

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:36.350
rocks and the dark rocks of the inner gorge.

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.570
The river divides the uplift into two plateaus,
which form the North Rim and South Rim of

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:49.510
the canyon. Flying over the South Rim and
Grand Canyon Village, we enjoy a view of the

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:55.340
canyon well-documented by almost four and
a half million visitors each year. From the

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:00.490
village, visitors gain access to the Bright
Angel Trail, a popular pathway for canyon

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:05.799
hikers, established here because the Bright
Angel Fault has fractured the otherwise impenetrable

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:12.799
cliffs.

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:20.310
Following the Bright Angel Fault across the
canyon to the north, we arrive at the North

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:27.310
Rim, which reaches elevations over 9,000 ft.
As we pass, note the Kaibab Monocline, which

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:34.700
forms the eastern edge of the Kaibab Uplift.

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:43.510
We return to the river down Crystal Creek.
In 1966 a large storm caused a debris flow

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:49.379
to surge down Crystal Creek, enter the Colorado
River and create overnight one of the toughest

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:50.379
rapids on the river.

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:57.379
Ahead is Powell Plateau, an erosional remnant
of the North Rim named for John Wesley Powell,

00:02:58.919 --> 00:03:05.919
who, in 1869, was the first explorer to survey
and map the canyon from one end to the other.

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:12.329
At Powell Plateau the character of the canyon
changes. Here the Esplanade Sandstone, one

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:18.430
of the Paleozoic rock layers, forms a wide,
red rock bench within the canyon. Fossils

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:25.430
in the Paleozoic rocks provide evidence of
the region’s dynamic geologic history. Shellfish,

00:03:25.749 --> 00:03:31.590
coral, reptile tracks and fern fossils reveal
the ancient oceans, deserts and swamps that

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:38.590
once existed here.

00:03:38.719 --> 00:03:44.069
On the left, is Havasu Creek. This creek is
famous for its blue-green water, stunning

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:50.260
waterfalls and travertine pools. This is the
traditional home of the Havasupai, or “people

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:57.260
of the blue-green waters,” who still occupy
the canyon today.

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:05.919
Further downriver, we approach Vulcan’s
Throne, the remnant of an ancient volcano.

00:04:05.919 --> 00:04:11.790
Beginning 630,000 years ago, lava poured forth
over the canyon rim from volcanoes such as

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:18.790
this, damming the river at least 13 times.
Each time the river was blocked, water collected

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:23.490
behind the dams. Eventually the weight and
pressure of the water caused them to catastrophically

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:30.490
fail. Remains of these dams can still be seen
perched on the cliff walls. Volcanic eruptions

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:37.919
came to an end about 10,000 years ago.

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:53.389
Upon passing the lava flows, we cross the
Hurricane Fault, one of a series of north

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:58.879
to south trending faults that cut across the
canyon. The Hurricane Fault was originally

00:04:58.879 --> 00:05:05.879
active during the Precambrian Era, but has
been reactivated numerous times since. Like

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:13.270
fossils, faults provide insight into Grand
Canyon’s complex geologic history.

00:05:19.919 --> 00:05:24.620
Many fault-oriented tributaries are visible
in this section of the canyon, including Separation

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:29.689
Canyon, named such because it was here that
three of John Wesley Powell’s men left the

00:05:29.689 --> 00:05:34.990
group in 1869, never to be seen again.

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:40.360
Long before Powell visited the canyon, prehistoric
peoples were living along the river. Rock

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:47.289
art, cliff dwellings and pot sherds serve
as evidence of their presence here. Additionally,

00:05:47.289 --> 00:05:52.800
caves throughout the canyon contain the remains
of large ice age mammals, such as giant ground

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:59.800
sloth, camels, mastodon, and horses. The discovery
of clovis style spear points indicates that

00:06:00.759 --> 00:06:05.139
ice age hunters also dwelled within the canyons
walls 12,000 years ago.

00:06:05.139 --> 00:06:12.139
Our 277 mile journey through Grand Canyon
ends abruptly at the Grandwash Cliffs. As

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:23.039
we pull away, the full, spectacular length
of this grandest of all canyons comes into

00:06:23.039 --> 00:06:30.039
view once again. The geologic story of this
impressive feature is complicated, but with

00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:39.590
each day we learn something new. As time passes,
the aged rocks will continue to be eroded.

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:44.669
Although we can only imagine how this feature
will appear in the next million years, its

00:06:44.669 --> 00:06:49.770
value as a geologic and visual masterpiece
is apparent and we will continue to protect

00:06:49.770 --> 00:06:51.479
it for generations to come.
