that the urban edges are toward you open

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.899 
that the urban edges are toward you open
up<00:00:51.120> to<00:00:51.870> the<00:00:51.960> center<00:00:52.170> of<00:00:52.289> the<00:00:52.440> pages<00:00:52.890> and<00:00:53.039> fold

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:53.909 
up to the center of the pages and fold

00:00:53.909 --> 00:00:57.170 
up to the center of the pages and fold
down<00:00:54.120> into<00:00:54.479> a<00:00:54.539> triangle<00:00:55.820> this<00:00:56.820> is<00:00:56.969> a<00:00:57.030> typical

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
down into a triangle this is a typical

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.479 
down into a triangle this is a typical
origami<00:00:57.989> fall<00:00:58.320> and<00:00:58.530> they<00:00:58.860> take<00:00:59.100> some<00:00:59.309> practice

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489 
origami fall and they take some practice

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:11.870 
origami fall and they take some practice
to<00:00:59.879> get<00:00:59.969> the<00:01:00.119> hang<00:01:00.210> off<00:01:10.520> then<00:01:11.520> do<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:11.850> other

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880 
to get the hang off then do the other

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:18.880 
to get the hang off then do the other
side<00:01:12.830> then<00:01:13.830> folded<00:01:14.659> simply<00:01:15.950> turn<00:01:16.950> it<00:01:17.159> around

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:18.890 
side then folded simply turn it around

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.880 
side then folded simply turn it around
it's<00:01:19.890> time<00:01:20.159> to<00:01:20.369> fold<00:01:20.610> like<00:01:20.940> a<00:01:21.179> paper<00:01:21.450> airplane

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890 
it's time to fold like a paper airplane

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.499 
it's time to fold like a paper airplane
so<00:01:22.890> folding<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.429> edges<00:01:23.460> to<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.390> center

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
so folding the edges to the center

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.609 
so folding the edges to the center
crease<00:01:25.850> again<00:01:26.850> using<00:01:27.569> your<00:01:27.720> knife<00:01:27.869> help

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
crease again using your knife help

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.889 
crease again using your knife help
sharpen<00:01:28.920> those<00:01:29.220> bulbs<00:01:29.520> then<00:01:30.330> fold<00:01:30.659> it<00:01:30.780> in

00:01:30.889 --> 00:01:30.899 
sharpen those bulbs then fold it in

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:37.510 
sharpen those bulbs then fold it in
again<00:01:34.069> do<00:01:35.069> the<00:01:35.220> same<00:01:35.429> for<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:35.759> other<00:01:35.909> side

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
again do the same for the other side

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.490 
again do the same for the other side
should<00:01:38.520> look<00:01:38.729> like<00:01:38.970> this<00:01:39.390> once<00:01:40.200> you've<00:01:40.350> done

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:43.850 
that turn it over and do the same a

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:47.570 
that turn it over and do the same a
great<00:01:44.850> thing<00:01:45.119> about<00:01:45.270> this<00:01:45.450> plat<00:01:45.959> pot<00:01:46.429> is<00:01:47.429> it

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:47.580
