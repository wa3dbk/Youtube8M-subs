00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
the walls there's a whole conservation

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:06.859 
the walls there's a whole conservation
angle<00:01:05.549> to<00:01:05.670> things<00:01:05.850> as<00:01:06.000> well<00:01:06.180> ya<00:01:06.479> know<00:01:06.720> it's

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:06.869 
angle to things as well ya know it's

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.020 
angle to things as well ya know it's
it's<00:01:07.409> really<00:01:07.470> cool<00:01:07.950> it's<00:01:08.159> really<00:01:08.220> deep<00:01:08.700> like

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 
it's really cool it's really deep like

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:11.660 
it's really cool it's really deep like
surprisingly<00:01:09.810> deep<00:01:10.140> and<00:01:10.470> I<00:01:10.770> honestly<00:01:11.220> I<00:01:11.460> don't

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:11.670 
surprisingly deep and I honestly I don't

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.399 
surprisingly deep and I honestly I don't
think<00:01:11.909> anyone<00:01:12.299> expected<00:01:12.330> that<00:01:12.990> and<00:01:13.110> it's<00:01:13.229> also

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
think anyone expected that and it's also

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.710 
think anyone expected that and it's also
it's<00:01:14.220> like<00:01:14.280> a<00:01:14.340> really<00:01:14.580> nice<00:01:14.790> proof<00:01:15.119> of<00:01:15.270> concept

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
it's like a really nice proof of concept

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.359 
it's like a really nice proof of concept
at<00:01:15.840> these<00:01:15.990> early<00:01:16.259> days<00:01:16.290> like<00:01:16.740> what<00:01:17.100> could<00:01:17.250> we

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
at these early days like what could we

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.340 
at these early days like what could we
get<00:01:17.520> down<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:17.790> line<00:01:18.000> in<00:01:18.240> terms<00:01:18.420> of<00:01:18.659> like<00:01:18.869> theme

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350

parks simulators and stuff like that so
that<00:01:21.420> really<00:01:21.869> interests<00:01:22.290> me<00:01:22.350> and<00:01:22.560> just<00:01:22.710> I

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:22.890 
that really interests me and just I

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.280 
that really interests me and just I
think<00:01:23.189> one<00:01:23.490> thing<00:01:23.670> that<00:01:23.790> also<00:01:23.939> I<00:01:24.360> think

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
think one thing that also I think

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.289 
think one thing that also I think
surprised<00:01:25.650> us<00:01:25.890> was<00:01:26.130> the<00:01:26.340> how<00:01:26.549> good<00:01:26.939> Kinect

00:01:27.289 --> 00:01:27.299 
surprised us was the how good Kinect

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:29.690 
surprised us was the how good Kinect
works<00:01:27.509> you<00:01:27.840> know<00:01:27.960> Kinect<00:01:28.320> works<00:01:28.700> fairly

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
works you know Kinect works fairly

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.520 
works you know Kinect works fairly
fantastically<00:01:30.570> and<00:01:30.630> when<00:01:30.780> it<00:01:30.869> comes<00:01:31.049> to<00:01:31.320> it

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
fantastically and when it comes to it

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.590 
fantastically and when it comes to it
certainly<00:01:31.950> a<00:01:32.040> great<00:01:32.189> example<00:01:32.430> of<00:01:32.670> how<00:01:32.759> Kinect

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
certainly a great example of how Kinect

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.690 
certainly a great example of how Kinect
can<00:01:33.720> be<00:01:33.810> used<00:01:33.990> for<00:01:34.170> very<00:01:34.350> light<00:01:34.680> dropping<00:01:35.610> in

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
can be used for very light dropping in

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:36.830 
can be used for very light dropping in
and<00:01:35.759> out<00:01:35.850> kind<00:01:36.150> of<00:01:36.210> gameplay<00:01:36.390> we're<00:01:36.659> not

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840 
and out kind of gameplay we're not

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:38.630 
and out kind of gameplay we're not
constantly<00:01:37.530> having<00:01:37.590> to<00:01:37.890> use<00:01:38.100> it<00:01:38.280> we're<00:01:38.610> just

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
constantly having to use it we're just

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.730 
constantly having to use it we're just
helping<00:01:38.939> to<00:01:39.119> enhance<00:01:39.360> your<00:01:40.140> experience<00:01:40.290> just

helping to enhance your experience just

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.190 
helping to enhance your experience just
a<00:01:40.860> little<00:01:41.310> bit<00:01:41.720> we'll<00:01:42.720> come<00:01:42.840> back<00:01:42.960> to<00:01:43.020> that<00:01:43.140> in

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
a little bit we'll come back to that in

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.120 
a little bit we'll come back to that in
a<00:01:43.259> second<00:01:43.470> because<00:01:43.530> you'll<00:01:43.710> be<00:01:43.770> able<00:01:43.829> to<00:01:43.950> see<00:01:44.100> a

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
a second because you'll be able to see a

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.010 
a second because you'll be able to see a
little<00:01:44.220> bit<00:01:44.310> that<00:01:44.490> footage<00:01:44.700> running<00:01:44.970> but<00:01:45.899> I

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:46.020 
little bit that footage running but I

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:47.060 
little bit that footage running but I
did<00:01:46.200> want<00:01:46.320> to<00:01:46.350> say<00:01:46.439> was<00:01:46.560> just<00:01:46.619> driving<00:01:47.009> around

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
did want to say was just driving around

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.039 
did want to say was just driving around
we<00:01:47.700> have<00:01:47.970> some<00:01:48.119> being<00:01:48.299> reminded<00:01:48.600> of<00:01:48.840> playing

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
we have some being reminded of playing

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.319 
we have some being reminded of playing
GTA<00:01:49.259> yeah<00:01:49.950> which<00:01:50.670> is<00:01:50.790> a<00:01:50.820> weird<00:01:51.119> kind<00:01:51.240> of

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
GTA yeah which is a weird kind of

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:52.370 
GTA yeah which is a weird kind of
comparison<00:01:51.720> but<00:01:51.780> I<00:01:51.840> think<00:01:51.960> it<00:01:52.020> does<00:01:52.110> speak<00:01:52.350> to

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
comparison but I think it does speak to

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.230 
comparison but I think it does speak to
the<00:01:52.560> visual<00:01:52.860> quality<00:01:52.979> of<00:01:53.369> what<00:01:53.490> Zoo<00:01:53.700> Tycoon<00:01:53.850> is

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:54.240 
the visual quality of what Zoo Tycoon is

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.380 
the visual quality of what Zoo Tycoon is
produced<00:01:54.899> and<00:01:55.640> unfortunately<00:01:56.640> you<00:01:56.759> can't<00:01:57.060> run

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
produced and unfortunately you can't run

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:58.940 
produced and unfortunately you can't run
out<00:01:57.420> as<00:01:57.630> soon<00:01:57.780> as<00:01:57.810> you<00:01:57.930> run<00:01:58.380> over<00:01:58.560> this<00:01:58.619> video

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
out as soon as you run over this video

00:01:58.950 --> 00:01:59.959 
out as soon as you run over this video
it's<00:01:59.100> one<00:01:59.219> of<00:01:59.280> those<00:01:59.369> little<00:01:59.640> moments<00:01:59.759> that

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
it's one of those little moments that

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:01.069 
it's one of those little moments that
kind<00:02:00.180> of<00:02:00.210> draws<00:02:00.450> you<00:02:00.509> out<00:02:00.630> of<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:00.930> game

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
kind of draws you out of the game

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.660 
kind of draws you out of the game
because<00:02:01.200> then<00:02:01.590> slide<00:02:01.979> out<00:02:02.159> the<00:02:02.189> way<00:02:02.310> not<00:02:02.610> that

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:02.670 
because then slide out the way not that

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:04.069 
because then slide out the way not that
we<00:02:02.759> expected<00:02:03.149> be<00:02:03.210> able<00:02:03.329> to<00:02:03.390> run<00:02:03.540> them<00:02:03.689> over<00:02:03.930> but

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
we expected be able to run them over but

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:06.050 
we expected be able to run them over but
just<00:02:04.259> there<00:02:05.040> might<00:02:05.189> be<00:02:05.219> another<00:02:05.549> animation<00:02:05.909> I

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
just there might be another animation I

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.029 
just there might be another animation I
kinda<00:02:06.570> wanted<00:02:06.899> to<00:02:07.079> be<00:02:07.350> able<00:02:07.530> to<00:02:07.680> run<00:02:07.829> people

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
kinda wanted to be able to run people

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:09.410 
kinda wanted to be able to run people
over<00:02:08.220> that's<00:02:08.849> because<00:02:09.000> you're<00:02:09.149> sick<00:02:09.300> in<00:02:09.390> the

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
over that's because you're sick in the

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.109 
over that's because you're sick in the
head

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119

but here we can see connected up and

00:02:11.799 --> 00:02:13.470 
but here we can see connected up and
running<00:02:12.010> this<00:02:12.250> is<00:02:12.400> one<00:02:12.519> of<00:02:12.610> the<00:02:12.700> sensory

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
running this is one of the sensory

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.140 
running this is one of the sensory
interaction<00:02:14.230> things<00:02:14.860> now<00:02:15.250> important<00:02:15.970> point

kinectimals i think it's from the same
studio<00:02:45.160> in<00:02:45.400> fact<00:02:45.670> and<00:02:45.910> it's<00:02:46.720> just<00:02:47.079> silly

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:47.410 
studio in fact and it's just silly

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
you know kids are gonna love it we've

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:52.339 
you know kids are gonna love it we've
found<00:02:49.780> probably<00:02:50.530> too<00:02:50.769> much<00:02:50.920> enjoyment<00:02:51.489> in

00:02:52.339 --> 00:02:52.349 
found probably too much enjoyment in

00:02:52.349 --> 00:02:54.990 
found probably too much enjoyment in
Tigers<00:02:53.349> and<00:02:53.560> stroking<00:02:53.980> tigers<00:02:54.370> and<00:02:54.519> stuff<00:02:54.760> but

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
Tigers and stroking tigers and stuff but

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.059 
Tigers and stroking tigers and stuff but
that's<00:02:55.450> fine<00:02:55.690> you<00:02:56.049> know<00:02:56.200> there's<00:02:56.440> always<00:02:56.650> that

00:02:57.059 --> 00:02:57.069 
that's fine you know there's always that

00:02:57.069 --> 00:02:58.559 
that's fine you know there's always that
doesn't<00:02:57.549> have<00:02:57.640> to<00:02:57.730> be<00:02:57.790> so<00:02:57.940> serious<00:02:58.209> all<00:02:58.510> the

00:02:58.559 --> 00:02:58.569 
doesn't have to be so serious all the

00:02:58.569 --> 00:03:00.180 
doesn't have to be so serious all the
time<00:02:58.659> there's<00:02:59.079> this<00:02:59.290> time<00:02:59.829> for<00:03:00.040> a<00:03:00.069> bit<00:03:00.159> of

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
time there's this time for a bit of

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:01.890 
time there's this time for a bit of
color<00:03:00.489> and<00:03:00.819> a<00:03:00.879> bit<00:03:01.000> of<00:03:01.120> silliness<00:03:01.420> and<00:03:01.569> we<00:03:01.810> have

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
color and a bit of silliness and we have

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:03.509 
color and a bit of silliness and we have
enjoyment<00:03:02.200> in<00:03:02.470> our<00:03:02.590> lives<00:03:02.769> with<00:03:02.980> this<00:03:03.099> xbox1

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:03.519 
enjoyment in our lives with this xbox1

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:05.069 
enjoyment in our lives with this xbox1
and<00:03:03.879> I<00:03:04.030> think<00:03:04.390> this<00:03:04.510> just<00:03:04.540> speaks<00:03:04.959> to

00:03:05.069 --> 00:03:05.079 
and I think this just speaks to

00:03:05.079 --> 00:03:08.309 
and I think this just speaks to
Microsoft's<00:03:05.799> like<00:03:06.180> how<00:03:07.180> much<00:03:07.930> variation

00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:08.319 
Microsoft's like how much variation

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:09.780 
Microsoft's like how much variation
they've<00:03:08.769> got<00:03:08.920> in<00:03:09.010> this<00:03:09.069> launch<00:03:09.310> lineup<00:03:09.519> there

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790 
they've got in this launch lineup there

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:11.550 
they've got in this launch lineup there
really<00:03:10.000> is<00:03:10.239> something<00:03:10.540> for<00:03:10.690> everyone<00:03:11.049> and<00:03:11.349> I

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
really is something for everyone and I

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.380 
really is something for everyone and I
think<00:03:12.069> this<00:03:12.159> is<00:03:12.250> gonna<00:03:12.430> surprise<00:03:12.609> a<00:03:13.090> lot<00:03:13.329> of

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:13.390 
think this is gonna surprise a lot of

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:15.120 
think this is gonna surprise a lot of
people<00:03:13.780> come<00:03:13.959> launch<00:03:14.200> day<00:03:14.410> you<00:03:14.680> know<00:03:14.799> picking

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.130 
people come launch day you know picking

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:16.620 
people come launch day you know picking
up<00:03:15.220> their<00:03:15.400> kids<00:03:15.639> and<00:03:15.849> I'm<00:03:15.910> finding<00:03:16.150> it's<00:03:16.389> 5:00

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630 
up their kids and I'm finding it's 5:00

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:18.690 
up their kids and I'm finding it's 5:00
a.m.<00:03:16.750> and<00:03:17.109> they're<00:03:17.230> still<00:03:17.440> you<00:03:18.130> know<00:03:18.250> laying

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:18.700 
a.m. and they're still you know laying

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:21.120 
a.m. and they're still you know laying
out<00:03:18.910> roads<00:03:19.419> and<00:03:19.750> stuff<00:03:19.900> in<00:03:20.049> their<00:03:20.200> zoo<00:03:20.380> yeah<00:03:20.859> I

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:21.130 
out roads and stuff in their zoo yeah I

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:22.860 
out roads and stuff in their zoo yeah I
think<00:03:21.609> graphically<00:03:22.269> would<00:03:22.450> say<00:03:22.599> this<00:03:22.720> is

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:22.870 
think graphically would say this is

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:25.020 
think graphically would say this is
probably<00:03:22.959> just<00:03:23.139> a<00:03:23.739> margin<00:03:24.400> short<00:03:24.730> of<00:03:24.819> what<00:03:24.940> we

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
probably just a margin short of what we

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.119 
probably just a margin short of what we
would<00:03:25.120> consider<00:03:25.239> really<00:03:26.079> next-gen<00:03:26.709> levels<00:03:27.040> of

00:03:27.119 --> 00:03:27.129 
would consider really next-gen levels of

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:28.860 
would consider really next-gen levels of
graphics<00:03:27.519> but<00:03:27.730> we<00:03:28.180> have<00:03:28.299> to<00:03:28.419> compliment<00:03:28.810> the

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
graphics but we have to compliment the

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:30.900 
graphics but we have to compliment the
animation<00:03:29.459> fantastic<00:03:30.459> animation<00:03:30.790> on

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:30.910 
animation fantastic animation on

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:32.360 
animation fantastic animation on
everything<00:03:31.269> I<00:03:31.389> earn<00:03:31.450> more<00:03:31.540> feels<00:03:31.780> really<00:03:32.139> real

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370 
everything I earn more feels really real

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.680 
everything I earn more feels really real
really<00:03:33.370> real<00:03:33.669> yeah<00:03:34.060> pretty<00:03:34.269> really<00:03:34.540> real

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:51.300 
the water can use to clean them or to
when<00:03:49.599> you<00:03:49.690> feed<00:03:49.900> them<00:03:50.109> all<00:03:50.319> those<00:03:50.470> sensory

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:51.310 
when you feed them all those sensory

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:52.439 
when you feed them all those sensory
interaction<00:03:51.760> sensors<00:03:52.090> we<00:03:52.209> talked<00:03:52.359> about

00:03:52.439 --> 00:03:52.449 
interaction sensors we talked about

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:54.240 
interaction sensors we talked about
earlier<00:03:52.780> all<00:03:53.319> really<00:03:53.829> really<00:03:53.859> top<00:03:54.220> quality

00:03:59.339 --> 00:03:59.349 
this point you know you look at your

00:03:59.349 --> 00:04:00.930 
this point you know you look at your
spoilt<00:03:59.709> for<00:03:59.739> choice<00:03:59.889> when<00:04:00.280> it<00:04:00.310> comes<00:04:00.400> to<00:04:00.669> Xbox

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:03.790 
one stuff but we really didn't portray

pretty much every other launch tile this

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:12.240 
pretty much every other launch tile this
is<00:04:11.199> a<00:04:11.230> nice<00:04:11.440> game<00:04:11.680> you<00:04:11.769> know<00:04:11.829> you<00:04:11.859> can't<00:04:12.129> run

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:12.250
