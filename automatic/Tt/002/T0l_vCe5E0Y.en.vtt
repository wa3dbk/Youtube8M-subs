We like to have something good and tasty on our holidays, so we

00:00:13.005 --> 00:00:18.723
will prepare crispy Bread Rolls which are very easy to make.

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:24.540

Amchur(mango) powder - 1/4 tsp

00:00:52.554 --> 00:00:55.586
Red chilly powder - less than 1/4 tsp

00:00:56.161 --> 00:00:58.899
Garam  masala - 1/4 tsp

00:00:59.298 --> 00:01:01.616
Oil - to fry bread rolls

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.604
Heat the pan and break potatoes into small pieces.

00:01:19.804 --> 00:01:39.824
Pour 1 tbsp oil in the pan, put green chillies, ginger, coriander powder in hot oil.

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:49.074
 Fry the spices a little then put the potato pieces.

00:01:57.478 --> 00:02:22.886
Add salt, Amchur powder, red chilly powder, Garam masala and green coriander to the potatoes.

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:30.791
Stir fry all the ingredients till they mix well together.

00:02:33.113 --> 00:02:35.383
Break the potatoes some more with a spoon.

00:02:38.062 --> 00:02:40.411
The stuffing required for the bread rolls is ready.

00:02:52.498 --> 00:02:58.694
Cut off the hard, brown edges of the bread slices.

00:03:18.693 --> 00:03:33.468
Divide the potato stuffing into 12 equal portions(oval shaped).

00:03:33.668 --> 00:03:36.676
Take some water in a plate

00:03:41.233 --> 00:03:59.546
dip 1 bread slice in water. Take out the slice immediately, press to remove water.

00:04:01.373 --> 00:04:29.923
Place 1 portion of potato mixture on the bread and wrap it up(close all sides). Then keep it on a plate.

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:44.892
Potato mix should be completely covered with bread.

00:04:51.767 --> 00:04:57.246
Similarly make bread rolls with all the bread slices.

00:04:57.655 --> 00:04:59.631
Heat oil.

00:05:11.726 --> 00:05:16.107
 Now that the oil is hot we will fry the Bread Rolls.

00:05:37.381 --> 00:05:43.581
Regularly turn the bread rolls from one side to another till they turn brown all over.

00:05:47.709 --> 00:05:51.559
Take them out on a plate.

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:29.488
Hot and crispy Bread Rolls are ready.

00:06:29.936 --> 00:06:43.994
Do remeber that the hoil should be hot when frying the Bread Rolls else they tend to break.

00:06:44.277 --> 00:06:49.507
Serve Bread Rols with sweet chutney or green coriander chutney.

00:06:49.853 --> 00:06:56.174
