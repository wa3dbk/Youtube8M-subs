put the dress into Photoshop and this is

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.280 
put the dress into Photoshop and this is
why<00:01:54.120> people<00:01:54.180> are<00:01:54.510> seeing<00:01:54.690> all<00:01:54.870> four<00:01:55.140> colors

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
why people are seeing all four colors

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:58.130 
why people are seeing all four colors
see<00:01:56.010> the<00:01:56.160> gold<00:01:56.370> or<00:01:56.580> black<00:01:56.970> color<00:01:57.300> is<00:01:57.540> on<00:01:57.930> the

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
see the gold or black color is on the

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.170 
see the gold or black color is on the
color<00:01:58.320> spectrum<00:01:58.470> right<00:01:59.100> on<00:01:59.340> the<00:01:59.700> line<00:01:59.880> between

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:00.180 
color spectrum right on the line between

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:03.260 
color spectrum right on the line between
the<00:02:00.810> two<00:02:00.990> colors<00:02:01.350> and<00:02:02.070> the<00:02:02.220> same<00:02:02.490> for<00:02:03.000> the

the two colors and the same for the

the two colors and the same for the
white<00:02:03.510> and<00:02:03.720> blue<00:02:04.080> and<00:02:04.530> in<00:02:04.830> my<00:02:04.920> opinion<00:02:05.040> when

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:05.400 
white and blue and in my opinion when

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:08.330 
white and blue and in my opinion when
you<00:02:05.490> put<00:02:05.700> our<00:02:05.910> blue<00:02:06.360> kind<00:02:06.870> of<00:02:07.190> graphic<00:02:08.190> on<00:02:08.310> the

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
you put our blue kind of graphic on the

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.160 
you put our blue kind of graphic on the
sides<00:02:08.640> there<00:02:08.879> I<00:02:09.060> feel<00:02:09.509> like<00:02:09.569> it<00:02:09.720> pulls<00:02:09.959> the

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
sides there I feel like it pulls the

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:12.500 
sides there I feel like it pulls the
blue<00:02:10.379> eyes<00:02:10.739> into<00:02:11.039> a<00:02:11.069> little<00:02:11.459> bit<00:02:11.549> done<00:02:11.700> it<00:02:11.819> so

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:12.510 
blue eyes into a little bit done it so

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.780 
blue eyes into a little bit done it so
we<00:02:13.409> decided<00:02:13.769> to<00:02:13.890> bring<00:02:13.980> the<00:02:14.159> doctor<00:02:14.370> in<00:02:14.640> for

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
we decided to bring the doctor in for

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:15.959 
we decided to bring the doctor in for
this<00:02:14.879> one

00:02:15.959 --> 00:02:15.969 
this one

00:02:15.969 --> 00:02:19.599 
this one
okay<00:02:17.110> so<00:02:18.110> we're<00:02:18.650> we<00:02:18.950> would<00:02:19.069> ask<00:02:19.189> you<00:02:19.340> is<00:02:19.489> this

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:19.609 
okay so we're we would ask you is this

00:02:19.609 --> 00:02:22.449 
okay so we're we would ask you is this
an<00:02:19.760> optical<00:02:20.180> illusion<00:02:20.230> is<00:02:21.230> this<00:02:21.469> a<00:02:21.500> biology

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
an optical illusion is this a biology

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:24.459 
an optical illusion is this a biology
like<00:02:22.939> the<00:02:23.060> way<00:02:23.180> we<00:02:23.209> see<00:02:23.629> things<00:02:23.659> there's<00:02:24.379> so

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:24.469 
like the way we see things there's so

00:02:24.469 --> 00:02:26.559 
like the way we see things there's so
many<00:02:24.709> explanations<00:02:25.219> for<00:02:25.670> this<00:02:25.790> but<00:02:26.120> I<00:02:26.150> think

00:02:26.559 --> 00:02:26.569 
many explanations for this but I think

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:28.330 
many explanations for this but I think
it's<00:02:26.659> probably<00:02:26.810> a<00:02:27.079> lot<00:02:27.349> of<00:02:27.469> biology<00:02:28.010> so<00:02:28.189> when

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:28.340 
it's probably a lot of biology so when

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.280 
it's probably a lot of biology so when
you<00:02:28.430> look<00:02:28.670> at<00:02:28.819> something<00:02:29.450> you're<00:02:29.780> not<00:02:29.989> just

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
you look at something you're not just

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:31.660 
you look at something you're not just
seeing<00:02:30.530> that<00:02:30.680> color<00:02:30.980> that<00:02:31.189> color<00:02:31.400> has<00:02:31.549> to

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:31.670 
seeing that color that color has to

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.640 
seeing that color that color has to
reflect<00:02:31.909> back<00:02:32.269> to<00:02:32.659> you<00:02:32.870> so<00:02:33.109> if<00:02:33.319> you're<00:02:33.530> in

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
reflect back to you so if you're in

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.710 
reflect back to you so if you're in
complete<00:02:33.890> darkness<00:02:34.459> and<00:02:34.670> something<00:02:35.000> is<00:02:35.120> fire

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
complete darkness and something is fire

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.330 
complete darkness and something is fire
engine<00:02:36.079> red<00:02:36.109> you<00:02:36.409> can't<00:02:36.650> see<00:02:36.799> the<00:02:36.890> red<00:02:37.069> right

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
engine red you can't see the red right

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.460 
engine red you can't see the red right
because<00:02:37.879> it<00:02:38.000> has<00:02:38.180> to<00:02:38.329> reflect<00:02:38.569> back<00:02:38.930> so<00:02:39.200> when

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:39.470 
because it has to reflect back so when

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:41.470 
because it has to reflect back so when
it<00:02:39.709> reflects<00:02:40.099> back<00:02:40.310> to<00:02:40.670> you<00:02:40.879> then<00:02:41.269> your<00:02:41.450> eyes

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
it reflects back to you then your eyes

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.330 
it reflects back to you then your eyes
have<00:02:41.840> to<00:02:42.019> filter<00:02:42.290> filter<00:02:42.799> out<00:02:43.010> some<00:02:43.189> of<00:02:43.250> that

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.340 
have to filter filter out some of that

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.250 
have to filter filter out some of that
extraneous<00:02:43.909> reflection<00:02:44.719> so<00:02:44.900> maybe<00:02:45.079> that

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:45.260 
extraneous reflection so maybe that

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.440 
extraneous reflection so maybe that
glare<00:02:45.650> or<00:02:45.889> some<00:02:46.310> of<00:02:46.340> the<00:02:46.489> other<00:02:46.639> aspects<00:02:47.299> of

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
glare or some of the other aspects of

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.509 
glare or some of the other aspects of
that<00:02:47.659> light<00:02:47.930> that<00:02:48.409> are<00:02:48.590> not<00:02:48.799> necessary<00:02:49.430> for

00:02:49.509 --> 00:02:49.519 
that light that are not necessary for

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:51.520 
that light that are not necessary for
you<00:02:49.760> to<00:02:49.790> interpret<00:02:50.329> that<00:02:50.629> color<00:02:50.930> and<00:02:51.200> so<00:02:51.290> that

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
you to interpret that color and so that

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:53.440 
you to interpret that color and so that
is<00:02:51.680> what<00:02:51.829> the<00:02:51.920> theory<00:02:52.220> is<00:02:52.310> is<00:02:52.579> that<00:02:52.790> as<00:02:52.970> we're

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:53.450 
is what the theory is is that as we're

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:55.479 
is what the theory is is that as we're
doing<00:02:53.659> that<00:02:53.959> that<00:02:54.200> filter<00:02:54.680> may<00:02:54.889> be<00:02:54.950> different

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:55.489 
doing that that filter may be different

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:57.399 
doing that that filter may be different
in<00:02:55.579> different<00:02:55.700> individuals<00:02:56.540> so<00:02:57.019> we're<00:02:57.230> seeing

00:02:57.399 --> 00:02:57.409 
in different individuals so we're seeing

00:02:57.409 --> 00:02:59.199 
in different individuals so we're seeing
less<00:02:57.709> and<00:02:57.739> less<00:02:58.010> perhaps<00:02:58.280> of<00:02:58.639> that<00:02:58.790> darkness

00:02:59.199 --> 00:02:59.209 
less and less perhaps of that darkness

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:02.289 
less and less perhaps of that darkness
of<00:02:59.540> that<00:02:59.569> particular<00:03:00.340> dress<00:03:01.340> and<00:03:01.639> and<00:03:01.970> here

00:03:02.289 --> 00:03:02.299 
of that particular dress and and here

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:03.490 
of that particular dress and and here
you<00:03:02.419> can<00:03:02.540> see<00:03:02.599> this<00:03:02.959> is<00:03:03.139> this<00:03:03.349> is<00:03:03.470> a

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:03.500 
you can see this is this is a

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:05.800 
you can see this is this is a
photoshopped<00:03:04.099> version<00:03:04.489> of<00:03:05.239> it<00:03:05.329> so<00:03:05.480> this<00:03:05.659> is

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
photoshopped version of it so this is

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:07.089 
photoshopped version of it so this is
what<00:03:05.989> they're<00:03:06.169> saying<00:03:06.439> is<00:03:06.590> some<00:03:06.769> people<00:03:06.799> are

00:03:07.089 --> 00:03:07.099 
what they're saying is some people are

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:08.949 
what they're saying is some people are
seeing<00:03:07.310> what's<00:03:07.519> on<00:03:07.669> that<00:03:07.700> far<00:03:08.180> right<00:03:08.510> which<00:03:08.930> is

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:08.959 
seeing what's on that far right which is

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:10.659 
seeing what's on that far right which is
that<00:03:09.290> blue<00:03:09.590> and<00:03:09.799> that<00:03:09.859> black<00:03:10.250> and<00:03:10.430> I<00:03:10.459> got<00:03:10.579> to

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:10.669 
that blue and that black and I got to

00:03:10.669 --> 00:03:13.690 
that blue and that black and I got to
tell<00:03:10.790> you<00:03:10.939> someone<00:03:11.689> did<00:03:11.959> post<00:03:12.379> the<00:03:12.799> dress<00:03:13.159> that

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
tell you someone did post the dress that

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.909 
tell you someone did post the dress that
was<00:03:13.879> that<00:03:14.389> was<00:03:14.480> on<00:03:14.720> the<00:03:14.900> internet<00:03:15.290> for<00:03:15.409> sale

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:15.919 
was that was on the internet for sale

00:03:15.919 --> 00:03:18.449 
was that was on the internet for sale
and<00:03:16.189> it<00:03:16.519> looks<00:03:16.760> a<00:03:16.939> lot<00:03:17.329> more<00:03:17.389> like<00:03:17.870> that<00:03:18.169> right

00:03:18.449 --> 00:03:18.459 
and it looks a lot more like that right

00:03:18.459 --> 00:03:20.949 
and it looks a lot more like that right
right<00:03:19.459> sand<00:03:19.760> and<00:03:19.940> the<00:03:20.120> owner<00:03:20.329> is<00:03:20.599> saying<00:03:20.870> this

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:20.959 
right sand and the owner is saying this

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:22.240 
right sand and the owner is saying this
is<00:03:21.079> absolutely<00:03:21.500> no<00:03:21.739> doubt<00:03:21.769> about<00:03:21.949> is

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
is absolutely no doubt about is

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.039 
is absolutely no doubt about is
blameless<00:03:22.609> so<00:03:22.940> you<00:03:23.000> have<00:03:23.150> to<00:03:23.269> ask<00:03:23.299> yourself<00:03:23.599> to

00:03:24.039 --> 00:03:24.049 
blameless so you have to ask yourself to

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:26.110 
blameless so you have to ask yourself to
what<00:03:24.409> kind<00:03:24.739> of<00:03:24.889> light<00:03:25.099> was<00:03:25.400> that<00:03:25.430> picture

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:26.120 
what kind of light was that picture

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.960 
what kind of light was that picture
taken<00:03:26.569> in<00:03:26.919> when<00:03:27.919> they<00:03:28.040> were<00:03:28.099> asking<00:03:28.579> you<00:03:28.849> know

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
taken in when they were asking you know

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:31.539 
taken in when they were asking you know
is<00:03:29.180> this<00:03:29.540> blue<00:03:29.930> or<00:03:30.109> is<00:03:30.229> this<00:03:30.409> white<00:03:31.250> but

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:31.549 
is this blue or is this white but

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:33.159 
is this blue or is this white but
certainly<00:03:31.940> when<00:03:32.150> you<00:03:32.299> really<00:03:32.629> do<00:03:32.780> look<00:03:32.900> at<00:03:33.079> it

00:03:33.159 --> 00:03:33.169 
certainly when you really do look at it

00:03:33.169 --> 00:03:34.479 
certainly when you really do look at it
and<00:03:33.290> you<00:03:33.349> look<00:03:33.530> at<00:03:33.620> the<00:03:33.680> color<00:03:33.859> spectrum<00:03:34.040> it<00:03:34.370> is

00:03:34.479 --> 00:03:34.489 
and you look at the color spectrum it is

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:36.460 
and you look at the color spectrum it is
the<00:03:34.609> light<00:03:34.819> blue<00:03:35.150> and<00:03:35.419> there<00:03:35.930> is<00:03:36.049> some<00:03:36.260> black

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:36.470 
the light blue and there is some black

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:38.559 
the light blue and there is some black
to<00:03:36.709> it<00:03:36.829> but<00:03:37.010> if<00:03:37.099> it<00:03:37.220> was<00:03:37.370> pure<00:03:37.609> black<00:03:37.849> it<00:03:38.180> would

00:03:38.559 --> 00:03:38.569 
to it but if it was pure black it would

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:40.270 
to it but if it was pure black it would
not<00:03:38.720> look<00:03:38.989> gold<00:03:39.319> because<00:03:39.769> it<00:03:39.799> would<00:03:40.010> not<00:03:40.129> be

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:40.280 
not look gold because it would not be

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.009 
not look gold because it would not be
able<00:03:40.340> to<00:03:40.459> reflect<00:03:40.909> back<00:03:41.120> to<00:03:41.449> you<00:03:41.629> because

00:03:42.009 --> 00:03:42.019 
able to reflect back to you because

00:03:42.019 --> 00:03:44.649 
able to reflect back to you because
black<00:03:42.290> just<00:03:42.560> absorbs<00:03:43.220> all<00:03:43.430> color<00:03:43.729> so<00:03:44.299> there<00:03:44.629> is

00:03:44.649 --> 00:03:44.659 
black just absorbs all color so there is

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:47.559 
black just absorbs all color so there is
okay<00:03:45.440> so<00:03:45.859> there<00:03:46.040> is<00:03:46.129> some<00:03:46.340> blue<00:03:46.549> there<00:03:47.090> is<00:03:47.239> some

00:03:47.559 --> 00:03:47.569 
okay so there is some blue there is some

00:03:47.569 --> 00:03:49.569 
okay so there is some blue there is some
black<00:03:47.840> but<00:03:48.319> there<00:03:48.470> is<00:03:48.590> some<00:03:48.829> goldish<00:03:49.310> or
