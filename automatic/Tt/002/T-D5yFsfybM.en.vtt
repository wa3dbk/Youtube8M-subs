00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:08.389
 hello today we're going to make some hamburgers 

00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:10.809
 of tofu in a very simple and very 

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:10.809
 fast 

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:15.820
 to do it we need all of your 

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:17.860
 fresh to which we are going to add then a 

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:19.599
 little bit of flour we're going to despise and 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:22.180
 let's put salt so we're going to 

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:24.220
 start now to make the hamburgers what 

00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:26.730
 first thing we have to do is grate 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.730
 the tofu 

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:32.550
 As you can see, I picked up a grater that 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.710
 It has a fairly large cut for 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.420
 then we can knead well because if we do not 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:40.010
 it would be too creamy and 

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.010
 we can not make hamburgers 

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.530
 once we have all the tofu 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:00.910
 we 'll put it in a bowl more 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.680
 great to be able to work comfortably 

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:06.230
 and let's start with special 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.920
 we are going to put curry and cumin and 

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:10.840
 a little salt 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.939
 the tofu as you know has a flavor 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.950
 quite neutral so it's important 

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:18.070
 if you want the flavor to take strength 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:20.140
 the special is pretty 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:23.700
 the yellow curry is also going to 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.700
 Give the hamburger enough color 

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:41.000
 once we have it special and we 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.530
 we have put salt let's start 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.730
 mix it well so that we have the 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:45.730
 as homogeneous as possible 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.650
 and once we have the mixture well 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.020
 done let's start with the 

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:06.060
 burgers we 're going to help from the 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:10.069
 flour so that once we put it 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:12.049
 to fry, keep it and give it consistency 

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:15.549
 so when we get to fry we 

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:15.549
 will break and if we have everything together 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.020
 and once we have made the 

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.660
 We're going to put the burgers 

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:42.490
 griddle 

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:44.380
 then a food can be taken 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:45.580
 fresh without having to cook it but 

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:47.590
 we are going to spend a little bit 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:49.150
 iron almost without oil because we want 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:50.410
 to bend on the outside and leave a 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.540
 little bit especially the flour that 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.680
 we have added and in this way so 

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:56.530
 simple we have done our 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:58.030
 vegetarian burgers for 12 and yes os 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:02:59.560
