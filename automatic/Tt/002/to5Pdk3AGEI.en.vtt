00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.510 
players and and at times it caused us
problems<00:00:51.390> but<00:00:51.840> we<00:00:52.110> may<00:00:52.739> be<00:00:52.800> Reuters<00:00:53.219> look<00:00:53.399> a

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
problems but we may be Reuters look a

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.600 
problems but we may be Reuters look a
little<00:00:53.670> a<00:00:53.940> little<00:00:54.180> bit<00:00:54.539> what<00:00:54.690> is<00:00:55.079> and<00:00:55.610> which

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
little a little bit what is and which

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:57.650 
little a little bit what is and which
you<00:00:56.640> need<00:00:56.879> you<00:00:57.059> know<00:00:57.180> when<00:00:57.329> you<00:00:57.390> come<00:00:57.539> to

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
you need you know when you come to

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.020 
you need you know when you come to
places<00:00:57.870> like<00:00:58.020> this<00:00:58.289> but<00:00:58.500> I<00:00:58.859> think<00:00:59.309> overall<00:00:59.730> for

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
places like this but I think overall for

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.729 
places like this but I think overall for
the<00:01:00.059> effort<00:01:00.420> and<00:01:00.449> the<00:01:00.600> way<00:01:01.140> that<00:01:01.289> every<00:01:01.559> single

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
the effort and the way that every single

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.000 
the effort and the way that every single
got<00:01:02.640> out<00:01:02.820> there<00:01:03.000> the<00:01:03.750> effort<00:01:04.559> they're<00:01:04.710> putting

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
got out there the effort they're putting

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.730 
got out there the effort they're putting
we<00:01:05.909> deserve<00:01:06.210> something<00:01:06.420> is<00:01:07.320> there<00:01:07.500> a<00:01:07.530> gut

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
we deserve something is there a gut

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.530 
we deserve something is there a gut
feeling<00:01:07.979> though<00:01:08.220> that<00:01:08.250> that<00:01:08.670> probably<00:01:09.299> isn't

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
feeling though that that probably isn't

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.390 
feeling though that that probably isn't
enough<00:01:09.840> today<00:01:10.020> they've<00:01:10.650> inspired<00:01:10.890> him<00:01:11.250> now

enough today they've inspired him now

enough today they've inspired him now

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:34.350 
and when you do that irrespective of

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:37.760 
and when you do that irrespective of
what's<00:01:34.860> gone<00:01:35.490> on<00:01:35.549> resto<00:01:36.210> season<00:01:36.659> you<00:01:37.590> know<00:01:37.619> you

what's gone on resto season you know you

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.249 
what's gone on resto season you know you

doll<00:01:40.409> although<00:01:41.100> i<00:01:41.400> suppose<00:01:42.240> it's<00:01:42.479> a<00:01:42.540> case<00:01:42.689> of

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:42.720 
doll although i suppose it's a case of

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.149 
doll although i suppose it's a case of
what<00:01:42.930> might<00:01:43.079> have<00:01:43.229> been<00:01:43.350> there<00:01:43.560> isn't<00:01:43.799> it<00:01:43.860> that

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
what might have been there isn't it that

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.770 
what might have been there isn't it that
sort<00:01:44.430> of<00:01:44.460> performance<00:01:44.729> away<00:01:45.270> from<00:01:45.450> no<00:01:45.570> more

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
sort of performance away from no more

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.450 
sort of performance away from no more
often<00:01:46.020> this<00:01:46.170> season<00:01:46.350> and<00:01:46.649> we<00:01:47.280> probably

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
often this season and we probably

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.069 
often this season and we probably
wouldn't<00:01:47.729> be<00:01:47.820> looking<00:01:48.060> at<00:01:48.149> a<00:01:48.210> team<00:01:48.420> in<00:01:48.930> the

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
wouldn't be looking at a team in the

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:52.010 
wouldn't be looking at a team in the
bottom<00:01:49.320> three<00:01:49.470> yeah<00:01:50.250> exactly

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
bottom three yeah exactly

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.779 
bottom three yeah exactly
Bashar<00:01:52.770> think<00:01:53.009> that's<00:01:53.159> what<00:01:53.369> being<00:01:53.579> one<00:01:53.759> of

00:01:53.779 --> 00:01:53.789 
Bashar think that's what being one of

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:55.609 
Bashar think that's what being one of
his<00:01:53.969> biggest<00:01:54.179> downs<00:01:54.450> follows<00:01:54.810> a<00:01:54.840> waveform<00:01:55.380> you

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
his biggest downs follows a waveform you

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.160 
his biggest downs follows a waveform you
know<00:01:55.710> I<00:01:55.950> think<00:01:56.280> it's<00:01:56.520> just<00:01:57.030> two<00:01:57.210> wins<00:01:57.359> away<00:01:57.899> all

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
know I think it's just two wins away all

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.160 
know I think it's just two wins away all
season<00:01:58.640> you<00:01:59.640> know<00:01:59.789> you're<00:02:00.689> obviously<00:02:00.899> going

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
season you know you're obviously going

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.020 
season you know you're obviously going
to<00:02:01.259> go<00:02:01.380> nowhere<00:02:01.829> with<00:02:02.130> that<00:02:02.159> kind<00:02:02.490> of<00:02:02.579> farm<00:02:02.820> but

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
to go nowhere with that kind of farm but

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.940 
to go nowhere with that kind of farm but
and<00:02:04.340> maybe<00:02:06.229> yet<00:02:07.229> obviously<00:02:07.380> were<00:02:07.740> pleased

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:07.950 
and maybe yet obviously were pleased

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.490 
and maybe yet obviously were pleased
with<00:02:08.250> the<00:02:08.340> performance<00:02:08.459> but<00:02:09.140> as<00:02:10.140> you<00:02:10.259> say<00:02:10.440> it

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
with the performance but as you say it

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.440 
with the performance but as you say it
could<00:02:10.649> be<00:02:10.769> four<00:02:10.950> straight<00:02:11.220> enough<00:02:11.459> while<00:02:12.209> come

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
could be four straight enough while come

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:14.710 
could be four straight enough while come
with<00:02:12.599> it<00:02:12.690> on<00:02:12.780> that<00:02:12.810> after<00:02:13.319> was<00:02:14.069> there<00:02:14.280> just<00:02:14.400> a

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
with it on that after was there just a

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.970 
with it on that after was there just a
looming<00:02:15.720> threat<00:02:15.750> of<00:02:15.930> relegation<00:02:16.080> today<00:02:16.739> did

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
looming threat of relegation today did

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:18.830 
looming threat of relegation today did
that<00:02:17.250> somehow<00:02:17.489> bring<00:02:18.209> the<00:02:18.299> best<00:02:18.450> out<00:02:18.599> of<00:02:18.660> you

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
that somehow bring the best out of you

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.740 
that somehow bring the best out of you
you<00:02:18.959> just<00:02:19.230> did<00:02:19.410> not<00:02:19.560> want<00:02:19.709> to<00:02:19.799> be<00:02:19.920> down<00:02:20.069> today

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:20.750

tom<00:02:22.400> I'm<00:02:23.400> not<00:02:23.580> too<00:02:23.760> sure<00:02:23.970> what<00:02:24.900> obviously

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
tom I'm not too sure what obviously

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.160 
tom I'm not too sure what obviously
aware<00:02:25.470> of<00:02:25.530> this<00:02:25.860> the<00:02:26.430> situation<00:02:26.810> as<00:02:27.810> everyone

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:28.170 
aware of this the situation as everyone

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:34.670 
aware of this the situation as everyone
was<00:02:28.319> before<00:02:29.360> you<00:02:30.360> know<00:02:30.480> but<00:02:32.450> I<00:02:33.620> think<00:02:34.620> the

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
was before you know but I think the

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.350 
was before you know but I think the
problem<00:02:34.829> was<00:02:35.069> we<00:02:35.280> needed<00:02:35.459> performances<00:02:36.209> like

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
problem was we needed performances like

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.890 
problem was we needed performances like
that<00:02:36.569> morphed<00:02:37.470> at<00:02:38.010> the<00:02:38.130> moment<00:02:38.630> you<00:02:39.630> know<00:02:39.720> but

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
that morphed at the moment you know but

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.110 
that morphed at the moment you know but
that's<00:02:40.319> gone<00:02:40.530> now<00:02:40.590> and<00:02:40.769> and<00:02:41.579> we<00:02:41.700> could<00:02:42.000> only

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
that's gone now and and we could only

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.210 
that's gone now and and we could only
affect<00:02:42.540> it<00:02:42.690> today<00:02:42.959> we've<00:02:43.709> obviously<00:02:43.829> done

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
affect it today we've obviously done

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.190 
affect it today we've obviously done
that<00:02:44.400> to<00:02:44.519> a<00:02:44.549> certain<00:02:44.730> extent<00:02:45.150> and<00:02:45.390> as<00:02:45.930> I<00:02:46.049> say

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
that to a certain extent and as I say

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.080 
that to a certain extent and as I say
off<00:02:46.319> forget<00:02:46.709> that<00:02:46.860> bill<00:02:47.010> of<00:02:47.160> them<00:02:47.310> should

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090

all just gets to the ball first but as I
