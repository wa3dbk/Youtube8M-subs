00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.580
 Hello everyone and today I am with my girlfriend 

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:09.420
 then we shoot for you a video like 

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:12.150
 make cookies with me 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:17.220
 enjoy and give you want to learn 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:21.810
 top so for making our cookies 

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:25.320
 we will need flour 206 orgam white 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:30.410
 sugar 130 grams brown sugar 140 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:33.840
 grams in candy mondays bigger egg and 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:37.440
 egg yolk butter 170 grams 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.950
 vanilla and a little soda and salt by 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.370
 to taste 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:44.070
 so our butter and fall asleep on the way rub 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:48.230
 here and interfere with it for well somewhere 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.230
 minutes and at medium speed 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:58.329
 but our oil has taken some 

00:00:54.899 --> 00:01:00.250
 strange state condition in general 

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:03.510
 now you need to pour white and 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:03.510
 Brown sugar 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.240
 and mix it all up until smooth 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:16.240
 masses 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:26.480
 in general, now we add an egg 

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.020
 five 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.580
 who broke the face alina developed the face and 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:47.479
 egg 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:51.320
 tupak and literally at the tip of the spoon 

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:57.560
 vanillin needs it quite a bit 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:59.909
 something like this and continue to beat 

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:04.320
 So you should get this 

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:06.840
 here's the page mocap porridge okay it seems a 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.600
 now you take well and we too 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:13.160
 Respectively big cup and in it 

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.160
 mix 250 grams of flour 

00:02:14.959 --> 00:02:21.630
 further baking soda and and need 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:27.750
 literally not everything not everything not everything literally 

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:31.650
 on the tip of a spoon something like this 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:35.700
 the amount of soda is also about the same 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:44.610
 the amount of salt it tastes so here we are 

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:48.870
 and mix it all up and onions whisk and 

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:53.040
 the difference is just to mix it up 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:56.640
 in short, now our flour and salt 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:59.299
 heights we add to the mass that us 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:59.299
 got a mix 

00:03:00.210 --> 00:03:04.500
 and we all go to mix how long ago 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:06.450
 forget to put on some tip 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:09.510
 I think you have it because the flour 

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:11.880
 will start to scatter all sides to when 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:15.650
 stirring food we bring down somewhere a minute 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.650
 to form a comfortable weight 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:22.720
 in general, we should get here 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:23.620
 such is the mass and now it needs 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.930
 cover by 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:29.290
 he cling and put 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:35.590
 fridge about 40 minutes darin 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:40.210
 half an hour and so we got our dough out 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:43.690
 here it is a little bit cooler both 

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:47.200
 chill turned out to be cold yes and 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:49.270
 now from it we will sculpt cookies 

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:51.670
 when you still need different 

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:53.770
 molds but you can just take a glass 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:56.380
 or you can take an ordinary glass or 

00:03:53.770 --> 00:03:59.220
 cover in general is to make your pupils 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:59.220
 more original 

00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:25.639
 and we also need of course 

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:28.880
 pan on this pan we we should 

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:32.270
 lining parchment paper here to 

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:37.389
 our cookies are not stuck here and yes 

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:40.639
 need to put the stove 180 degrees 

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:43.360
 warm up well and in principle yes you can 

00:04:40.639 --> 00:04:43.360
 sell in the same vein 

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:15.580
 and so in general, that's what we did 

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:17.530
 be careful when you bake 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:21.130
 watch them and more often for cookies because 

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:23.770
 that we understand them a little burned 

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:27.370
 we were slightly burned but one pair of stockings 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:28.510
 you can be put on 180 degrees 

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:30.880
 ten minutes of this will be quite 

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:32.410
 enough here to survive bridges from the test 

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:39.490
 Yes , we baked some countries 

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:50.980
 incomprehensible pieces of dough that's my we 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:57.430
 made a parody of the horn is very far away 

00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:59.800
 even delicious even in the above video so 

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:02.740
 that pray and delicious tea or cocoa 

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:04.200
 far as here and enjoy these 

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:09.900
 cookies 

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:15.160

00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:16.750
