heavy<00:01:21.150> metal<00:01:21.479> sort<00:01:21.689> sound<00:01:21.960> to<00:01:22.560> give<00:01:22.710> you<00:01:22.830> saw

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:23.630 
heavy metal sort sound to give you saw

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:25.969 
heavy metal sort sound to give you saw
wider<00:01:24.630> perspective<00:01:25.320> of<00:01:25.439> what<00:01:25.560> sounds<00:01:25.770> like

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
wider perspective of what sounds like

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:58.740 
wider perspective of what sounds like
right<00:01:26.790> so<00:01:26.970> here<00:01:27.150> we<00:01:27.180> go

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:58.750 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:01.420 

that's<00:01:59.750> in<00:01:59.960> the<00:02:00.050> bridge<00:02:00.260> position<00:02:00.440> now<00:02:01.370> the

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:01.430 
that's in the bridge position now the

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:03.970 
that's in the bridge position now the
second<00:02:01.970> position<00:02:02.390> of<00:02:02.480> it<00:02:02.630> is<00:02:03.440> the<00:02:03.710> bridge

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:03.980 
second position of it is the bridge

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:05.890 
second position of it is the bridge
where<00:02:04.610> parallel<00:02:05.060> connected<00:02:05.390> so<00:02:05.630> it's<00:02:05.750> like

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:05.900 
where parallel connected so it's like

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:07.480 
where parallel connected so it's like
having<00:02:06.140> a<00:02:06.200> single<00:02:06.560> coil<00:02:06.770> a<00:02:06.890> slight<00:02:07.130> coil

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:07.490 
having a single coil a slight coil

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:09.280 
having a single coil a slight coil
splitting<00:02:08.030> so<00:02:08.570> it's<00:02:08.720> only<00:02:08.840> gonna<00:02:09.020> be<00:02:09.110> using

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:09.290 
splitting so it's only gonna be using

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:11.920 
splitting so it's only gonna be using
this<00:02:10.280> pot<00:02:10.640> this<00:02:10.820> part<00:02:11.090> of<00:02:11.240> pickup<00:02:11.570> not<00:02:11.750> this

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930 
this pot this part of pickup not this

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.100 
this pot this part of pickup not this
bit<00:02:12.170> this<00:02:12.890> part<00:02:13.220> is<00:02:13.570> essentially<00:02:14.570> a<00:02:14.690> single

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
bit this part is essentially a single

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:43.650 
bit this part is essentially a single
coil

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:43.660 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:45.760 

now<00:02:44.660> moving<00:02:44.930> on<00:02:45.140> to<00:02:45.170> the<00:02:45.380> middle<00:02:45.650> position

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:45.770 
now moving on to the middle position

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:48.960 
now moving on to the middle position
where<00:02:46.190> we<00:02:46.310> got<00:02:46.490> both<00:02:46.850> humbuckers<00:02:47.440> together<00:02:48.440> a

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
where we got both humbuckers together a

00:02:48.970 --> 00:03:15.620 
where we got both humbuckers together a
little<00:02:49.970> bit<00:02:50.090> like<00:02:50.240> this

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:15.630 

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:47.390 

right<00:03:16.630> so<00:03:17.020> uh<00:03:17.850> longer<00:03:18.850> do<00:03:19.000> know<00:03:19.180> showing<00:03:19.480> forth

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:47.400 

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.039 

now<00:03:48.400> to<00:03:48.459> the<00:03:48.790> fifth<00:03:49.000> position<00:03:49.150> which<00:03:49.599> is<00:03:49.780> the

00:03:50.039 --> 00:03:50.049 
now to the fifth position which is the

00:03:50.049 --> 00:04:22.700 
now to the fifth position which is the
neck<00:03:50.290> in<00:03:50.620> full<00:03:51.159> humbucker<00:03:51.549> mode

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:22.710 

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:25.500
