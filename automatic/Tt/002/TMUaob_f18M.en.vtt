what is awakening that's a good question
I<00:00:07.849> find<00:00:08.849> the<00:00:08.970> times<00:00:09.240> we<00:00:09.450> are<00:00:09.480> living<00:00:09.570> in<00:00:09.990> right

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
I find the times we are living in right

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.259 
I find the times we are living in right
now<00:00:10.260> are<00:00:10.650> the<00:00:10.769> most<00:00:11.010> extremely<00:00:11.519> diverse<00:00:12.090> and

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
now are the most extremely diverse and

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:15.499 
now are the most extremely diverse and
radical<00:00:12.719> times<00:00:12.990> of<00:00:13.170> all<00:00:14.089> collectively<00:00:15.089> and

00:00:15.499 --> 00:00:15.509 
radical times of all collectively and

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.890 
radical times of all collectively and
individually<00:00:17.029> we're<00:00:18.029> seeing<00:00:18.330> a<00:00:18.390> constant

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
individually we're seeing a constant

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.750 
individually we're seeing a constant
barrage<00:00:19.020> of<00:00:19.170> how<00:00:19.590> human<00:00:20.039> life<00:00:20.279> is<00:00:20.460> portrayed

barrage of how human life is portrayed

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.210 
barrage of how human life is portrayed
to<00:00:21.000> us<00:00:21.150> by<00:00:21.359> the<00:00:21.420> media<00:00:21.740> we're<00:00:22.740> finding<00:00:23.070> our

to us by the media we're finding our

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.730 
to us by the media we're finding our
identities<00:00:23.789> through<00:00:24.119> our<00:00:24.720> culture's<00:00:25.320> or<00:00:25.590> our

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
identities through our culture's or our

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:27.950 
identities through our culture's or our
social<00:00:26.070> circles<00:00:26.760> and<00:00:27.180> what<00:00:27.390> we<00:00:27.480> do<00:00:27.660> for<00:00:27.900> a

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:27.960 
social circles and what we do for a

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.330 
social circles and what we do for a
living<00:00:27.990> rather<00:00:28.769> than<00:00:29.130> in<00:00:29.279> who<00:00:29.490> we<00:00:29.640> are<00:00:31.219> and<00:00:32.219> a

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:32.340 
living rather than in who we are and a

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.010 
living rather than in who we are and a
deeper<00:00:32.610> question<00:00:32.969> to<00:00:33.120> that<00:00:33.270> would<00:00:33.480> be<00:00:33.630> Who<00:00:33.840> am

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
deeper question to that would be Who am

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.790 
deeper question to that would be Who am
I<00:00:34.200> Who<00:00:35.070> am<00:00:35.100> I<00:00:35.340> really<00:00:35.840> outside<00:00:36.840> my<00:00:37.110> work<00:00:37.350> or<00:00:37.649> my

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:46.819 
community Who am I when I am alone
facing<00:00:43.649> myself<00:00:45.260> and<00:00:46.260> this<00:00:46.350> is<00:00:46.410> a<00:00:46.559> good

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:46.829 
facing myself and this is a good

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:48.350 
facing myself and this is a good
question<00:00:47.070> because<00:00:47.520> we<00:00:47.820> keep<00:00:47.969> her<00:00:48.090> alive<00:00:48.300> so

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
question because we keep her alive so

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.510 
question because we keep her alive so
busy<00:00:49.170> that<00:00:49.320> we<00:00:49.379> have<00:00:49.590> lost<00:00:49.860> connection<00:00:50.489> with

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
busy that we have lost connection with

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.470 
busy that we have lost connection with
ourselves<00:00:52.309> and<00:00:53.309> this<00:00:53.520> reconnecting<00:00:54.449> with

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:54.480 
ourselves and this reconnecting with

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.750 
ourselves and this reconnecting with
ourselves<00:00:54.809> lets<00:00:55.530> us<00:00:55.649> understand<00:00:56.160> why<00:00:56.370> some<00:00:56.730> of

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
ourselves lets us understand why some of

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.110 
ourselves lets us understand why some of
us<00:00:56.969> today<00:00:57.329> feel<00:00:57.660> so<00:00:57.840> lost<00:00:58.109> or<00:00:58.980> feel<00:00:59.520> a<00:00:59.550> sense<00:00:59.969> of

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
us today feel so lost or feel a sense of

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.299 
us today feel so lost or feel a sense of
meaninglessness<00:01:00.449> or<00:01:01.199> will<00:01:01.920> live<00:01:02.129> with

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
meaninglessness or will live with

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.369

anxiety or whatever the issues are that

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.320 
anxiety or whatever the issues are that
arrives<00:01:04.739> when<00:01:04.979> we<00:01:05.129> really<00:01:05.430> take<00:01:05.640> that<00:01:05.820> time<00:01:06.090> to

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
arrives when we really take that time to

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:10.160 
arrives when we really take that time to
face<00:01:06.510> ourselves<00:01:08.299> so<00:01:09.299> much<00:01:09.360> healing<00:01:09.930> happens

face ourselves so much healing happens

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.780 
face ourselves so much healing happens
when<00:01:10.590> we<00:01:10.710> take<00:01:10.920> the<00:01:11.010> space<00:01:11.310> and<00:01:11.549> time<00:01:11.760> to

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
when we take the space and time to

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.780 
when we take the space and time to
unwind<00:01:12.150> and<00:01:13.110> unravel<00:01:13.530> and<00:01:13.860> unpack<00:01:14.280> the<00:01:14.520> truth
