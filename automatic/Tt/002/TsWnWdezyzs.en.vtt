than<00:01:09.510> there<00:01:09.750> usually<00:01:10.020> is<00:01:10.409> on<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:10.860> server

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
than there usually is on the server

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.370 
than there usually is on the server
since<00:01:11.490> it's<00:01:12.119> going<00:01:12.360> through<00:01:12.450> a<00:01:12.540> proxy<00:01:12.810> there

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
since it's going through a proxy there

since it's going through a proxy there
already<00:01:13.560> said<00:01:13.830> this<00:01:13.950> on<00:01:14.070> the<00:01:14.159> forums<00:01:14.460> so<00:01:14.670> if

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
already said this on the forums so if

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.060

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:11.410 
the game sorry I had a bit of a stroke

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:13.740 
the game sorry I had a bit of a stroke
there<00:05:11.620> and<00:05:11.800> with<00:05:12.250> a<00:05:12.570> since<00:05:13.570> they're

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:13.750

going to send the blessings through to

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:26.520 
going to send the blessings through to
your<00:05:23.110> dead<00:05:23.440> depart<00:05:24.070> or<00:05:24.310> mail<00:05:24.669> so<00:05:25.419> I<00:05:25.840> don't<00:05:26.410> know

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:26.530 
your dead depart or mail so I don't know

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:28.800 
your dead depart or mail so I don't know
how<00:05:26.740> they<00:05:26.979> would<00:05:27.130> do<00:05:27.580> this<00:05:27.760> without<00:05:27.970> giving

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:28.810 
how they would do this without giving

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:32.760 
how they would do this without giving
charms<00:05:29.169> so<00:05:29.500> charms<00:05:30.370> or<00:05:31.330> could<00:05:32.050> become<00:05:32.530> very

00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:32.770 
charms so charms or could become very

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:34.740 
charms so charms or could become very
expensive<00:05:32.919> since<00:05:33.520> they're<00:05:33.729> most<00:05:34.330> of<00:05:34.479> them<00:05:34.570> are

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:34.750 
expensive since they're most of them are

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:38.430 
expensive since they're most of them are
unobtainable<00:05:35.080> and<00:05:35.760> if<00:05:36.840> you<00:05:37.840> are<00:05:37.990> under<00:05:38.260> level

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:38.440

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:42.510 
unobtainable and if you are under level
120<00:05:39.070> is<00:05:39.700> you<00:05:39.880> can<00:05:40.060> sell<00:05:40.270> these<00:05:40.450> for<00:05:41.340> 20k

00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:42.520 
120 is you can sell these for 20k

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:48.270 
120 is you can sell these for 20k
each<00:05:42.729> and<00:05:43.680> you<00:05:44.680> can<00:05:45.070> then<00:05:45.550> buy<00:05:46.410> blessings<00:05:47.410> for

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:51.550 
yourself for maybe a 10k each so you can

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:53.670

make<00:05:51.669> profit<00:05:52.030> out<00:05:52.120> of<00:05:52.180> that<00:05:52.300> but<00:05:53.020> and<00:05:53.229> you'll

00:05:53.670 --> 00:05:53.680 
make profit out of that but and you'll

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:55.950 
make profit out of that but and you'll
also<00:05:53.919> for<00:05:54.280> each<00:05:54.490> time<00:05:54.760> you<00:05:54.880> died

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:55.960 
also for each time you died

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:58.770 
also for each time you died
you'll<00:05:56.380> get<00:05:56.590> 50%<00:05:57.280> of<00:05:57.760> the<00:05:57.880> experience<00:05:58.270> lost<00:05:58.479> so

00:05:58.770 --> 00:05:58.780 
you'll get 50% of the experience lost so

00:05:58.780 --> 00:06:01.080 
you'll get 50% of the experience lost so
let's<00:05:59.139> say<00:05:59.289> I'm<00:05:59.380> a<00:05:59.470> low-level<00:05:59.770> I<00:06:00.070> die<00:06:00.340> I<00:06:00.789> lose<00:06:01.060> a

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:01.090 
let's say I'm a low-level I die I lose a

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:03.570 
let's say I'm a low-level I die I lose a
hundred<00:06:01.360> experienced<00:06:01.960> that<00:06:02.289> when<00:06:03.039> I<00:06:03.070> log<00:06:03.340> in

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:03.580 
hundred experienced that when I log in

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:06.180 
hundred experienced that when I log in
later<00:06:03.910> when<00:06:04.210> they<00:06:04.360> will<00:06:04.780> be<00:06:04.930> giving<00:06:05.260> the<00:06:05.380> DEF

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:06.190 
later when they will be giving the DEF

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:08.640 
later when they will be giving the DEF
compensations<00:06:07.090> I<00:06:07.300> would<00:06:08.050> get<00:06:08.200> fifty

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:08.650 
compensations I would get fifty

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:11.219 
compensations I would get fifty
experience<00:06:09.130> for<00:06:09.760> that<00:06:09.910> and<00:06:10.150> for<00:06:10.180> example<00:06:11.020> my

00:06:11.219 --> 00:06:11.229 
experience for that and for example my

00:06:11.229 --> 00:06:13.710 
experience for that and for example my
druid<00:06:11.530> died<00:06:11.919> three<00:06:12.850> times<00:06:12.880> during<00:06:13.389> the<00:06:13.539> kicks

00:06:13.710 --> 00:06:13.720 
druid died three times during the kicks

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:15.719 
druid died three times during the kicks
and<00:06:13.840> legs<00:06:13.990> I<00:06:14.139> think<00:06:14.200> so<00:06:14.889> I'll<00:06:15.130> be<00:06:15.400> getting<00:06:15.669> a

00:06:15.719 --> 00:06:15.729 
and legs I think so I'll be getting a

00:06:15.729 --> 00:06:18.830 
and legs I think so I'll be getting a
fuck<00:06:15.970> ton<00:06:16.240> of<00:06:16.300> experience<00:06:16.780> from<00:06:17.110> that<00:06:17.139> and<00:06:17.530> I

00:06:18.830 --> 00:06:18.840 
fuck ton of experience from that and I

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:21.300 
fuck ton of experience from that and I
think<00:06:19.840> that<00:06:19.990> they<00:06:20.139> will<00:06:20.289> be<00:06:20.350> compensating

00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:21.310 
think that they will be compensating

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:23.460 
think that they will be compensating
items<00:06:22.060> as<00:06:22.210> well<00:06:22.330> but<00:06:22.570> the<00:06:23.020> thing<00:06:23.050> that's<00:06:23.350> most

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:23.470 
items as well but the thing that's most

00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:26.159 
items as well but the thing that's most
important<00:06:23.950> right<00:06:24.160> now<00:06:24.280> is<00:06:24.520> the<00:06:25.169> departure

important right now is the departure
since<00:06:26.650> that's<00:06:26.860> the<00:06:26.950> only<00:06:27.039> thing<00:06:27.340> that's

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:27.520 
since that's the only thing that's

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:30.270
