00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:06.899
 in my opinion, when I heard that 

00:00:04.170 --> 00:00:08.250
 Nobody is honest 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:09.150
 rockstar games what they are again 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.849
 allow 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.710
 So if you ask me at 2000 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.719
 at the same time as janne man yes I would be 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.760
 already rockstar games circle and long ago 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.350
 would protect the sowas of the open 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.160
 because the need that is in my opinion 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.160
 you 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.399
 the ruin is back 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.180
 excuse me that should not 

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:40.710
 weighted you 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.140
 that should be a rockstar games because 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.690
 Again, there are disgusting to super 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.790
 start the go out of rockstar games 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.739
 And yes, nobody has one or the other 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:51.750
 It was said to have already heard the duke 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.040
 and in the garage so many of them 

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.570
 We offered you that and there 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.220
 I thought that you constantly over 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.900
 meanwhile everyone in the online mode off 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:59.820
 but again i wanted to help you with that 

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.470
 next but I'm glad I still have it 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.750
 not have because for pretty much every 

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:06.149
 this car in the garage has is the 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.979
 clear path danger to go out friends 

00:01:06.149 --> 00:01:09.390
 that's abnormally dirty what rockstar 

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.340
 games 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.509
 because we have bronze through the update 

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.130
 and somehow it seems to me that way 

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:16.350
 that did not help at all 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:17.759
 anti cheat system updates this 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.960
 I have so my post found the 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.490
 everything around writes from one 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.830
 Trustworthy man, too 

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:24.390
 so often has the short published what 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.770
 about updates have said the 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.270
 then in retrospect of rockstar 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.720
 Games last published 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.940
 were 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.250
 I'll send you the foot one he says 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:33.929
 that a new automatic system in 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:37.080
 the game was added which 

00:01:33.929 --> 00:01:39.539
 automatically the garages of the players 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:41.099
 scans and therefore the idea is the 

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:43.770
 Recognition when looking at the vehicles 

00:01:41.099 --> 00:01:46.020
 recognizes and should now also thereby 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.300
 this newport jazz scene in the garage 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.190
 has recognized and as soon as you have this 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:51.300
 then vehicle either from the garage 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:53.429
 wanted to go out 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:55.020
 or just be smart and you 

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:55.470
 think that what you will see soon 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.179
 become 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.800
 only happens when their garage from the group consisting 

00:01:57.179 --> 00:02:01.500
 I want to drive and then it's easy 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.550
 The street orders it happens 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.539
 and same friends 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:05.369
 I'll just give you one 

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:07.319

 Just let go of Kruse with a buddy, yes 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.760
 already impressed by a horny 

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.440
 car you may even want it for him 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.750

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.190
 garage kitchen as give him that and 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.930
 drive the common to the garage and there 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:23.670
 so happens what the car explodes 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:25.110
 Simply without reason and you both see 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.640
 have committed suicide it was not 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.900

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.120
 confessed that someone made in kiel 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.080

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.290
 indescribable so we have first 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.780
