00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:36.120 
back on NBA 2k15 and you look at all the

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:38.060 
back on NBA 2k15 and you look at all the
kinks<00:00:36.510> in<00:00:36.630> the<00:00:36.750> game<00:00:36.989> such<00:00:37.290> as<00:00:37.440> all<00:00:37.620> the<00:00:37.770> cheese

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070

the<00:00:38.460> mechanics<00:00:39.090> and<00:00:39.270> the<00:00:39.300> physics<00:00:39.870> you<00:00:40.770> think

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
the mechanics and the physics you think

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.270 
the mechanics and the physics you think
get<00:00:41.610> there<00:00:41.820> going<00:00:42.120> the<00:00:42.239> right<00:00:42.390> direction

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:43.280 
get there going the right direction

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.029 
get there going the right direction
because<00:00:44.280> with<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.899> 27th<00:00:45.899> date<00:00:46.110> of<00:00:46.260> October<00:00:46.860> it

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
because with the 27th date of October it

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:49.279 
because with the 27th date of October it
gave<00:00:47.309> them<00:00:47.550> more<00:00:47.730> time<00:00:47.969> to<00:00:48.030> fit<00:00:48.510> these<00:00:48.750> actual

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
gave them more time to fit these actual

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.710 
gave them more time to fit these actual
you<00:00:49.680> know<00:00:49.710> these<00:00:50.070> kids<00:00:50.340> that's<00:00:50.700> in<00:00:50.850> the<00:00:50.940> game

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:51.720 
you know these kids that's in the game

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:53.840 
you know these kids that's in the game
now<00:00:52.320> it<00:00:52.500> seems<00:00:52.830> like<00:00:53.010> it's<00:00:53.190> not<00:00:53.340> going<00:00:53.610> to<00:00:53.730> be

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850 
now it seems like it's not going to be

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.170 
now it seems like it's not going to be
fixed<00:00:54.270> and<00:00:54.390> next<00:00:54.750> year<00:00:54.900> maybe<00:00:55.140> the<00:00:55.440> same<00:00:55.680> thing

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:56.180

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:19.050 
the outside looking in at this point it

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:20.750 
the outside looking in at this point it
don't<00:01:19.380> look<00:01:19.440> pretty<00:01:19.830> good<00:01:19.920> it<00:01:20.370> looks<00:01:20.580> like

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:20.760 
don't look pretty good it looks like

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.330 
don't look pretty good it looks like
it's<00:01:21.150> going<00:01:21.360> in<00:01:21.510> the<00:01:21.540> wrong<00:01:21.750> direction<00:01:21.810> and<00:01:22.620> I

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
it's going in the wrong direction and I

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.340 
it's going in the wrong direction and I
don't<00:01:23.520> want<00:01:23.640> to<00:01:23.729> see<00:01:23.880> the<00:01:24.030> same<00:01:24.240> game<00:01:24.660> but<00:01:25.200> they
