exfoliate<00:01:48.899> on<00:01:49.530> dirty<00:01:49.920> skin<00:01:50.280> if<00:01:50.460> that<00:01:50.610> makes

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
exfoliate on dirty skin if that makes

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.340 
exfoliate on dirty skin if that makes
sense<00:01:51.000> because<00:01:51.180> that's<00:01:51.960> really<00:01:52.170> doing

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.350 
sense because that's really doing

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:53.870 
sense because that's really doing
nothing<00:01:52.619> for<00:01:52.649> you<00:01:52.950> so<00:01:53.340> make<00:01:53.490> sure<00:01:53.520> you<00:01:53.729> clean
