a<00:00:28.010> little<00:00:28.279> stag<00:00:28.910> beetle<00:00:29.270> here<00:00:29.860> these<00:00:30.860> beetle

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:32.290 
a little stag beetle here these beetle

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:35.410 
a little stag beetle here these beetle
and<00:00:33.290> he<00:00:33.410> comes<00:00:33.560> with<00:00:33.740> reflector<00:00:34.250> as<00:00:34.460> a<00:00:35.210> little

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:35.420 
and he comes with reflector as a little

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:37.180 
and he comes with reflector as a little
mini<00:00:35.570> card<00:00:35.810> partner<00:00:36.140> reflectors<00:00:36.860> I<00:00:36.980> think<00:00:37.130> a

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:37.190 
mini card partner reflectors I think a

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:38.230 
mini card partner reflectors I think a
little<00:00:37.280> better<00:00:37.490> than<00:00:37.670> ground-pounder

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:38.240 
little better than ground-pounder

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:40.390 
little better than ground-pounder
overall<00:00:38.660> although<00:00:39.590> again<00:00:39.890> his<00:00:40.070> robot<00:00:40.370> mode

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:40.400 
overall although again his robot mode

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.520 
overall although again his robot mode
just<00:00:40.640> take<00:00:40.850> the<00:00:40.970> camera<00:00:41.150> stand<00:00:42.079> it<00:00:42.140> up<00:00:42.260> on<00:00:42.410> its

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:42.530 
just take the camera stand it up on its

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:44.290 
just take the camera stand it up on its
lens<00:00:42.770> and<00:00:43.070> there's<00:00:43.460> a<00:00:43.550> robot<00:00:43.880> mode<00:00:44.030> he<00:00:44.150> does

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:44.300 
lens and there's a robot mode he does

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:46.479 
lens and there's a robot mode he does
have<00:00:44.480> some<00:00:44.660> articulation<00:00:45.110> here<00:00:45.590> and<00:00:45.800> his<00:00:46.160> arms

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:46.489 
have some articulation here and his arms

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:47.830 
have some articulation here and his arms
since<00:00:46.850> they're<00:00:46.970> not<00:00:47.000> attached<00:00:47.390> to<00:00:47.420> treads

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:47.840 
since they're not attached to treads

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.389 
since they're not attached to treads
actually<00:00:48.199> looks<00:00:48.350> semi<00:00:48.620> proportional<00:00:49.129> to<00:00:49.280> his

00:00:49.389 --> 00:00:49.399 
actually looks semi proportional to his

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:51.490 
actually looks semi proportional to his
robot<00:00:49.699> mode<00:00:49.809> versus<00:00:50.809> ground-pounders<00:00:51.350> which

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:51.500 
robot mode versus ground-pounders which

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.979 
robot mode versus ground-pounders which
were<00:00:51.620> very<00:00:51.800> long<00:00:52.070> and<00:00:52.129> ridiculous

00:00:53.979 --> 00:00:53.989 
were very long and ridiculous

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:56.380 
were very long and ridiculous
so<00:00:54.559> yeah<00:00:54.680> and<00:00:54.800> he<00:00:54.859> also<00:00:55.070> turns<00:00:55.460> into<00:00:55.699> a<00:00:55.820> weapon

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.390 
so yeah and he also turns into a weapon

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:57.700 
so yeah and he also turns into a weapon
and<00:00:56.750> he's<00:00:56.930> spring-loaded<00:00:57.440> he's<00:00:57.620> actually

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:57.710 
and he's spring-loaded he's actually

00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:59.439 
and he's spring-loaded he's actually
pretty<00:00:57.920> cool<00:00:58.100> you<00:00:58.219> pull<00:00:58.399> these<00:00:58.519> down<00:00:58.579> I<00:00:59.030> just

00:00:59.439 --> 00:00:59.449 
pretty cool you pull these down I just

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:01.419 
pretty cool you pull these down I just
open<00:00:59.870> up<00:00:59.929> the<00:01:00.050> lens<00:01:00.230> and<00:01:00.679> he<00:01:00.800> Springs<00:01:01.129> forward

00:01:01.419 --> 00:01:01.429 
open up the lens and he Springs forward

00:01:01.429 --> 00:01:03.520 
open up the lens and he Springs forward
and<00:01:02.269> then<00:01:02.390> fold<00:01:02.600> down<00:01:02.719> his<00:01:02.840> peg<00:01:03.050> into<00:01:03.260> the<00:01:03.320> gun

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:03.530 
and then fold down his peg into the gun

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.410 
and then fold down his peg into the gun
mode<00:01:03.739> now<00:01:04.280> the<00:01:04.340> gun<00:01:04.519> mode<00:01:04.699> is<00:01:04.879> supposedly<00:01:05.300> like

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:05.420 
mode now the gun mode is supposedly like

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.150 
mode now the gun mode is supposedly like
this<00:01:05.600> -<00:01:05.990> looks<00:01:06.230> kind<00:01:06.320> of<00:01:06.440> like<00:01:06.530> a<00:01:06.590> crossbow

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:07.160 
this - looks kind of like a crossbow

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.370 
this - looks kind of like a crossbow
desk<00:01:07.670> tying<00:01:08.120> the<00:01:08.210> kind<00:01:08.480> of<00:01:08.510> weapon<00:01:08.780> I<00:01:08.930> like<00:01:09.290> to

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:09.380 
desk tying the kind of weapon I like to

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:10.450 
desk tying the kind of weapon I like to
flip<00:01:09.530> these<00:01:09.650> around<00:01:09.710> and<00:01:10.070> make<00:01:10.190> it<00:01:10.310> kind<00:01:10.370> of

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:10.460 
flip these around and make it kind of

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.610 
flip these around and make it kind of
like<00:01:10.580> an<00:01:10.670> electro<00:01:11.030> claw<00:01:11.330> type<00:01:12.140> of<00:01:12.260> weapon<00:01:12.500> like

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:12.620 
like an electro claw type of weapon like

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:13.930 
like an electro claw type of weapon like
maybe<00:01:12.800> kind<00:01:13.070> of<00:01:13.100> builds<00:01:13.400> up<00:01:13.490> a<00:01:13.580> ball<00:01:13.760> of<00:01:13.850> energy

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:13.940 
maybe kind of builds up a ball of energy

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.120 
maybe kind of builds up a ball of energy
right<00:01:14.330> here<00:01:14.510> before<00:01:14.630> it<00:01:14.840> shoots<00:01:15.080> but<00:01:15.980> it's

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:16.130 
right here before it shoots but it's

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:17.770 
right here before it shoots but it's
entirely<00:01:16.430> up<00:01:16.550> to<00:01:16.640> you<00:01:16.820> I<00:01:16.880> like<00:01:17.420> that<00:01:17.600> version

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780 
entirely up to you I like that version

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:22.030 
entirely up to you I like that version
of<00:01:17.960> the<00:01:18.020> weapon<00:01:18.200> better<00:01:19.090> but<00:01:20.650> this<00:01:21.650> is<00:01:21.799> tank

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:22.040 
of the weapon better but this is tank

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.249 
of the weapon better but this is tank
that<00:01:22.159> was<00:01:22.250> supposed<00:01:22.490> to<00:01:22.520> be<00:01:22.640> yet<00:01:23.079> it's<00:01:24.079> cool

00:01:24.249 --> 00:01:24.259 
that was supposed to be yet it's cool

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:25.539 
that was supposed to be yet it's cool
he's<00:01:24.500> flipping<00:01:24.799> and<00:01:24.890> put<00:01:25.100> that<00:01:25.220> back<00:01:25.369> up<00:01:25.520> and

00:01:25.539 --> 00:01:25.549 
he's flipping and put that back up and

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:28.120 
he's flipping and put that back up and
he<00:01:25.670> folds<00:01:25.909> back<00:01:26.030> up<00:01:26.210> the<00:01:26.360> robot<00:01:26.659> mode<00:01:27.040> lay<00:01:28.040> him

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:28.130 
he folds back up the robot mode lay him

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.440 
he folds back up the robot mode lay him
down<00:01:28.159> for<00:01:28.400> camera<00:01:28.640> mode<00:01:30.340> now<00:01:31.340> scrap<00:01:31.610> no<00:01:31.759> and

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450 
down for camera mode now scrap no and

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:33.639 
down for camera mode now scrap no and
that's<00:01:32.600> the<00:01:32.689> weird<00:01:32.869> things<00:01:33.110> like<00:01:33.320> their

00:01:33.639 --> 00:01:33.649 
that's the weird things like their

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:35.340 
that's the weird things like their
legends<00:01:33.950> class<00:01:34.159> they're<00:01:34.430> not<00:01:34.579> huge<00:01:34.970> but

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:35.350 
legends class they're not huge but

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:37.899 
legends class they're not huge but
somebody<00:01:36.350> took<00:01:36.470> a<00:01:36.560> picture<00:01:36.770> of<00:01:36.890> you<00:01:37.130> of<00:01:37.399> this

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:37.909 
somebody took a picture of you of this

00:01:37.909 --> 00:01:41.289 
somebody took a picture of you of this
guy<00:01:38.119> with<00:01:38.390> g1<00:01:38.899> shrapnel<00:01:39.439> and<00:01:39.860> he's<00:01:40.820> not<00:01:41.060> much

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:41.299 
guy with g1 shrapnel and he's not much

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:43.569 
guy with g1 shrapnel and he's not much
smaller<00:01:41.720> like<00:01:42.290> he's<00:01:42.439> a<00:01:42.799> little<00:01:43.009> less<00:01:43.130> bulky

00:01:43.569 --> 00:01:43.579 
smaller like he's a little less bulky

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:45.310 
smaller like he's a little less bulky
but<00:01:44.119> height<00:01:44.329> wise<00:01:44.540> in<00:01:44.719> a<00:01:44.780> robot<00:01:45.020> mode<00:01:45.170> they're

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:45.320 
but height wise in a robot mode they're

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:46.899 
but height wise in a robot mode they're
almost<00:01:45.469> the<00:01:45.649> exact<00:01:45.860> same<00:01:46.040> size<00:01:46.280> and<00:01:46.579> it's

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:46.909 
almost the exact same size and it's

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:48.819 
almost the exact same size and it's
weird<00:01:47.180> cuz<00:01:47.420> I<00:01:47.479> don't<00:01:47.689> remember<00:01:47.990> the<00:01:48.200> g1

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:48.829 
weird cuz I don't remember the g1

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:50.499 
weird cuz I don't remember the g1
insecticons<00:01:49.189> being<00:01:49.610> this<00:01:49.880> small<00:01:50.180> but<00:01:50.390> they

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:50.509 
insecticons being this small but they

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:52.240 
insecticons being this small but they
were<00:01:50.570> now<00:01:51.500> that<00:01:51.649> I<00:01:51.680> saw<00:01:51.890> one<00:01:52.100> of<00:01:52.130> the

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
were now that I saw one of the

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.429

you bring these down it's actually
really<00:02:03.140> cool<00:02:03.350> let's<00:02:03.950> put<00:02:04.130> the<00:02:04.219> legs<00:02:04.430> rotate

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:05.360 
really cool let's put the legs rotate

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:06.940 
really cool let's put the legs rotate
these<00:02:05.479> panels<00:02:05.869> off<00:02:05.990> to<00:02:06.079> the<00:02:06.170> side<00:02:06.380> of<00:02:06.469> the<00:02:06.530> leg

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:06.950 
these panels off to the side of the leg

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.260 
these panels off to the side of the leg
flip<00:02:07.340> the<00:02:07.460> foot<00:02:07.640> up<00:02:09.369> I<00:02:10.369> bring<00:02:10.759> the<00:02:10.880> waist<00:02:11.060> piece

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 
flip the foot up I bring the waist piece

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:15.070 
flip the foot up I bring the waist piece
forward<00:02:11.690> just<00:02:12.200> like<00:02:12.380> that<00:02:13.690> unpack<00:02:14.690> the<00:02:14.720> arms

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:15.080 
forward just like that unpack the arms

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.020 
forward just like that unpack the arms
here<00:02:15.320> now<00:02:16.130> here's<00:02:16.340> the<00:02:16.460> weird<00:02:16.640> thing<00:02:16.730> like

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:17.030 
here now here's the weird thing like

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.810 
here now here's the weird thing like
these<00:02:17.480> legs<00:02:17.900> fold<00:02:18.290> back<00:02:18.530> think<00:02:19.220> of<00:02:19.310> this<00:02:19.490> and

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:19.820 
these legs fold back think of this and

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:22.330 
these legs fold back think of this and
the<00:02:20.330> thing<00:02:20.540> is<00:02:20.720> like<00:02:20.900> they're<00:02:21.800> designed<00:02:22.190> so

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
the thing is like they're designed so

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.100 
the thing is like they're designed so
they<00:02:22.520> fold<00:02:22.790> back<00:02:22.970> as<00:02:23.150> one<00:02:23.390> is<00:02:23.690> supposed<00:02:23.959> to<00:02:23.989> be

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:24.110 
they fold back as one is supposed to be

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:25.960 
they fold back as one is supposed to be
like<00:02:24.230> one<00:02:24.410> piece<00:02:24.709> if<00:02:24.980> you<00:02:25.310> look<00:02:25.519> they're

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970 
like one piece if you look they're

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:27.790 
like one piece if you look they're
clearly<00:02:26.360> two<00:02:26.569> pieces<00:02:26.989> like<00:02:27.200> there's<00:02:27.560> two

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
clearly two pieces like there's two

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.140 
clearly two pieces like there's two
separate<00:02:28.190> legs<00:02:28.430> here

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
separate legs here

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.240 
separate legs here
the<00:02:29.239> problem<00:02:29.629> is<00:02:29.720> like<00:02:29.840> you'd<00:02:30.379> see<00:02:30.560> it<00:02:30.650> if<00:02:31.069> you

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
the problem is like you'd see it if you

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.940 
the problem is like you'd see it if you
can<00:02:31.879> see<00:02:32.120> it<00:02:32.239> bends<00:02:32.870> this<00:02:33.049> piece<00:02:33.349> to<00:02:33.620> fold<00:02:33.860> it

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950 
can see it bends this piece to fold it

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:35.710 
can see it bends this piece to fold it
over<00:02:34.040> it<00:02:34.250> so<00:02:34.670> they<00:02:34.790> made<00:02:35.180> these<00:02:35.360> as<00:02:35.540> two

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
over it so they made these as two

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.509 
over it so they made these as two
separate<00:02:36.080> pieces<00:02:36.290> and<00:02:36.680> then<00:02:37.099> made<00:02:37.280> them<00:02:37.370> so

00:02:37.509 --> 00:02:37.519 
separate pieces and then made them so

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:38.770 
separate pieces and then made them so
they<00:02:37.640> lock<00:02:37.879> together<00:02:38.030> so<00:02:38.450> you<00:02:38.510> can<00:02:38.659> only

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:38.780 
they lock together so you can only

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.539 
they lock together so you can only
really<00:02:38.959> move<00:02:39.170> them<00:02:39.290> as<00:02:39.409> one<00:02:39.620> I<00:02:39.830> think<00:02:40.250> if<00:02:40.430> you

00:02:40.539 --> 00:02:40.549 
really move them as one I think if you

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:42.309 
really move them as one I think if you
if<00:02:40.790> you<00:02:40.879> just<00:02:40.909> trimmed<00:02:41.360> this<00:02:42.019> Ridge<00:02:42.290> right

00:02:42.309 --> 00:02:42.319 
if you just trimmed this Ridge right

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:43.780 
if you just trimmed this Ridge right
here<00:02:42.560> you'd<00:02:42.890> be<00:02:43.010> able<00:02:43.040> to<00:02:43.220> move<00:02:43.370> this<00:02:43.549> these

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
here you'd be able to move this these

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:45.280 
here you'd be able to move this these
two<00:02:43.940> pieces<00:02:44.150> freely<00:02:44.599> from<00:02:44.780> each<00:02:44.900> other<00:02:45.080> and

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:45.290 
two pieces freely from each other and

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.229 
two pieces freely from each other and
maybe<00:02:45.739> get<00:02:45.980> some<00:02:46.129> more<00:02:46.159> dynamic<00:02:46.700> insect<00:02:47.060> leg

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:47.239 
maybe get some more dynamic insect leg

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:49.270 
maybe get some more dynamic insect leg
poses<00:02:47.599> out<00:02:47.720> of<00:02:47.840> it<00:02:47.930> I<00:02:48.110> don't<00:02:48.829> know<00:02:48.950> why<00:02:49.099> they

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:49.280 
poses out of it I don't know why they

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.819 
poses out of it I don't know why they
made<00:02:49.489> it<00:02:49.610> so<00:02:49.760> those<00:02:49.940> two<00:02:50.150> were<00:02:50.829> constantly

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:51.829 
made it so those two were constantly

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:55.050 
made it so those two were constantly
locked<00:02:52.069> together<00:02:52.220> but<00:02:52.879> oh<00:02:53.269> well

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:55.060 
locked together but oh well

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.059 
locked together but oh well
see<00:02:56.060> you<00:02:56.120> fold<00:02:56.329> those<00:02:56.420> down<00:02:56.739> bring<00:02:57.739> the<00:02:57.829> arms

00:02:58.059 --> 00:02:58.069 
see you fold those down bring the arms

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:06.400 
see you fold those down bring the arms
forward<00:02:58.129> like<00:02:59.060> this<00:02:59.920> and<00:03:03.519> open<00:03:04.519> up<00:03:05.410> well

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:06.410 
forward like this and open up well

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:07.900 
forward like this and open up well
antenna<00:03:06.709> here<00:03:06.829> and<00:03:07.040> then<00:03:07.400> the<00:03:07.489> whole<00:03:07.609> torso

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:07.910 
antenna here and then the whole torso

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.720 
antenna here and then the whole torso
piece<00:03:08.180> you<00:03:08.420> just<00:03:08.739> pull<00:03:09.739> up<00:03:09.769> and<00:03:10.069> down<00:03:10.280> slide

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:16.970 
there is grapnel aka shrapnel in robot

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:18.880 
there is grapnel aka shrapnel in robot
mode<00:03:17.150> and<00:03:17.390> he's<00:03:18.200> actually<00:03:18.440> pretty<00:03:18.680> nice

00:03:39.309 --> 00:03:39.319 
see the silver right there it's a little

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:42.039 
see the silver right there it's a little
tight<00:03:39.470> swivel<00:03:40.329> kind<00:03:41.329> of<00:03:41.389> have<00:03:41.480> to<00:03:41.540> pull<00:03:41.750> if<00:03:41.959> you

00:03:42.039 --> 00:03:42.049
