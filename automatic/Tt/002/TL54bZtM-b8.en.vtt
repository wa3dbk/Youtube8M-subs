00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900 
here this is the ZF 5 HP 24 gearbox or

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.959 
here this is the ZF 5 HP 24 gearbox or
transmission<00:00:13.740> that<00:00:14.070> we<00:00:14.190> call<00:00:14.460> it<00:00:14.610> that's

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
transmission that we call it that's

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:17.480 
transmission that we call it that's
talked<00:00:15.330> converted<00:00:15.870> there<00:00:16.080> it<00:00:16.529> starts<00:00:17.190> to<00:00:17.369> get

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:17.490 
talked converted there it starts to get

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:18.980 
talked converted there it starts to get
a<00:00:17.550> bit<00:00:17.820> technical<00:00:18.060> now<00:00:18.539> because<00:00:18.779> we're<00:00:18.900> going

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:18.990 
a bit technical now because we're going

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.679 
a bit technical now because we're going
to<00:00:19.080> be<00:00:19.170> taking<00:00:19.619> it<00:00:19.770> apart

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:20.689 
to be taking it apart

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:23.779 
to be taking it apart
this<00:00:21.689> is<00:00:21.840> the<00:00:22.050> D<00:00:22.230> assembly<00:00:22.830> sequence<00:00:23.100> and

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
this is the D assembly sequence and

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.390 
this is the D assembly sequence and
there's<00:00:24.720> quite<00:00:24.960> a<00:00:24.990> lot<00:00:25.199> to<00:00:25.230> do<00:00:25.560> we're<00:00:25.859> starting

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
there's quite a lot to do we're starting

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.790 
there's quite a lot to do we're starting
with<00:00:27.090> the<00:00:27.330> talk<00:00:27.570> of<00:00:27.599> the<00:00:27.990> reverse<00:00:28.470> and<00:00:28.710> be

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
with the talk of the reverse and be

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.080 
with the talk of the reverse and be
taking<00:00:29.189> that<00:00:29.340> out<00:00:29.550> and<00:00:29.880> then<00:00:30.869> moving<00:00:31.140> on<00:00:31.500> to

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:32.090 
taking that out and then moving on to

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.319 
taking that out and then moving on to
removing<00:00:33.090> the<00:00:33.120> bell<00:00:33.450> housing<00:00:33.690> and<00:00:34.290> oil<00:00:34.800> pump

00:00:35.319 --> 00:00:35.329 
removing the bell housing and oil pump

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:37.850 
removing the bell housing and oil pump
but<00:00:36.329> it<00:00:36.480> will<00:00:36.630> all<00:00:36.750> come<00:00:37.020> quite<00:00:37.350> clear<00:00:37.649> in<00:00:37.800> a

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:37.860 
but it will all come quite clear in a

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:40.700 
but it will all come quite clear in a
minute<00:00:38.570> but<00:00:39.570> it<00:00:39.690> is<00:00:39.719> going<00:00:39.930> to<00:00:40.020> be<00:00:40.230> quite

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
minute but it is going to be quite

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:43.220 
minute but it is going to be quite
difficult<00:00:40.920> to<00:00:41.219> do<00:00:41.489> we've<00:00:42.480> got<00:00:42.719> the<00:00:42.899> book<00:00:43.079> of

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
difficult to do we've got the book of

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.170 
difficult to do we've got the book of
instructions<00:00:43.469> to<00:00:44.040> show<00:00:44.160> us<00:00:44.460> how<00:00:44.640> to<00:00:44.700> do<00:00:44.940> it<00:00:44.969> as

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
instructions to show us how to do it as

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.979 
instructions to show us how to do it as
a<00:00:45.239> view<00:00:45.750> of<00:00:46.070> the<00:00:47.070> length<00:00:47.789> of<00:00:48.000> the<00:00:48.270> gearbox<00:00:48.750> is

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
a view of the length of the gearbox is

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.470 
a view of the length of the gearbox is
quite<00:00:49.320> long<00:00:49.559> this<00:00:50.010> is<00:00:50.160> the<00:00:50.460> workbench<00:00:51.300> that

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:51.480 
quite long this is the workbench that

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.139 
quite long this is the workbench that
we're<00:00:51.870> going<00:00:51.960> to<00:00:52.079> be<00:00:52.199> using<00:00:52.739> to<00:00:53.309> actually<00:00:53.340> do

00:00:54.139 --> 00:00:54.149 
we're going to be using to actually do

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:59.990 
we're going to be using to actually do
semble<00:00:54.690> the<00:00:55.230> parts<00:00:56.190> on<00:00:56.399> and<00:00:58.370> in<00:00:59.370> a<00:00:59.489> minute<00:00:59.760> here

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
semble the parts on and in a minute here

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.849 
semble the parts on and in a minute here
you'll<00:01:00.270> see<00:01:00.510> that<00:01:00.719> I've<00:01:00.989> turned<00:01:01.649> the

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
you'll see that I've turned the

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.240 
you'll see that I've turned the
transmission<00:01:02.699> upside<00:01:03.030> down<00:01:03.890> so<00:01:04.890> we<00:01:05.070> can

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
transmission upside down so we can

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.000 
transmission upside down so we can
really<00:01:05.489> get<00:01:05.790> to<00:01:05.850> grips<00:01:06.240> with<00:01:06.420> the<00:01:07.140> first<00:01:07.799> thing

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
really get to grips with the first thing

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.760 
really get to grips with the first thing
off<00:01:08.189> is<00:01:08.430> obviously<00:01:08.790> the<00:01:08.970> drive<00:01:09.560> the<00:01:10.560> valve

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
off is obviously the drive the valve

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:13.700 
off is obviously the drive the valve
gear<00:01:11.250> and<00:01:11.880> we're<00:01:12.270> taking<00:01:12.600> the<00:01:12.750> pan<00:01:13.049> off<00:01:13.320> right

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
gear and we're taking the pan off right

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.200 
gear and we're taking the pan off right
now<00:01:14.040> or<00:01:14.430> should<00:01:15.299> I<00:01:15.390> say<00:01:15.540> my<00:01:15.720> assistant<00:01:16.229> is<00:01:17.210> here

there and F is at the rights at the back
this<00:02:38.510> is<00:02:38.659> very<00:02:38.989> difficult<00:02:39.349> to<00:02:39.560> see<00:02:39.739> that's<00:02:40.010> the

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.390 
this is very difficult to see that's the

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:46.059 
this is very difficult to see that's the
the<00:02:41.390> output<00:02:41.540> shaft<00:02:42.340> and<00:02:44.019> mounting<00:02:45.019> here<00:02:45.410> is<00:02:45.650> a

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:46.069 
the output shaft and mounting here is a

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:49.539 
the output shaft and mounting here is a
and<00:02:46.670> B<00:02:47.060> that's<00:02:47.329> out<00:02:47.840> that's<00:02:48.349> input<00:02:48.859> shaft<00:02:49.190> a

00:02:49.539 --> 00:02:49.549 
and B that's out that's input shaft a

00:02:49.549 --> 00:02:52.990 
and B that's out that's input shaft a

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:53.000 
and clutch housing and B they're joined

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.750 
and clutch housing and B they're joined
together<00:02:53.150> with<00:02:53.709> some<00:02:54.709> snap<00:02:55.010> rings<00:02:55.340> I'll<00:02:55.640> be

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:55.760 
together with some snap rings I'll be

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.390 
together with some snap rings I'll be
showing<00:02:55.970> how<00:02:56.209> that<00:02:56.269> comes<00:02:56.629> apart<00:02:57.049> this<00:02:57.769> is<00:02:58.040> the

00:02:58.390 --> 00:02:58.400 
showing how that comes apart this is the

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:02.050 
showing how that comes apart this is the
oil<00:02:58.760> pump<00:02:59.060> and<00:02:59.390> the<00:03:00.260> bell<00:03:00.500> housing<00:03:01.030> which<00:03:02.030> is

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
oil pump and the bell housing which is

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.240 
oil pump and the bell housing which is
obviously<00:03:02.659> and<00:03:03.530> we're<00:03:03.890> not<00:03:04.040> going<00:03:04.190> to

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 
obviously and we're not going to

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:05.949 
obviously and we're not going to
actually<00:03:04.519> be<00:03:04.640> doing<00:03:04.879> much<00:03:05.090> with<00:03:05.420> that<00:03:05.659> part

00:03:05.949 --> 00:03:05.959 
actually be doing much with that part

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:08.110 
actually be doing much with that part
from<00:03:06.170> changing<00:03:06.620> a<00:03:06.680> few<00:03:06.980> o-rings<00:03:07.489> and<00:03:07.760> so<00:03:07.940> on

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
from changing a few o-rings and so on

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.809 
from changing a few o-rings and so on
I've<00:03:08.959> got<00:03:09.200> the<00:03:09.349> valve<00:03:09.560> gear<00:03:09.859> out<00:03:10.099> there<00:03:10.430> on<00:03:10.670> the

00:03:10.809 --> 00:03:10.819 
I've got the valve gear out there on the

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:11.460 
I've got the valve gear out there on the
table

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:11.470 
table

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:14.710 
table
we're<00:03:12.470> just<00:03:12.590> going<00:03:12.859> back<00:03:13.010> to<00:03:13.069> the<00:03:13.450> sump<00:03:14.450> and

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:14.720 
we're just going back to the sump and

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.349 
we're just going back to the sump and
you<00:03:15.139> can<00:03:15.349> actually<00:03:15.620> see<00:03:16.099> this<00:03:16.639> little<00:03:17.030> tiny

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:17.359 
you can actually see this little tiny

00:03:17.359 --> 00:03:18.430 
you can actually see this little tiny
bits<00:03:17.690> of<00:03:17.930> swarf

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 
bits of swarf

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.710 
bits of swarf
on<00:03:18.620> the<00:03:18.769> magnets<00:03:19.220> there<00:03:19.549> it's<00:03:20.030> not<00:03:20.209> easy<00:03:20.419> to

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
on the magnets there it's not easy to

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.949 
on the magnets there it's not easy to
see<00:03:20.930> but<00:03:21.400> there's<00:03:22.400> some<00:03:22.669> foreign<00:03:23.629> bodies

00:03:23.949 --> 00:03:23.959 
see but there's some foreign bodies

00:03:23.959 --> 00:03:25.960 
see but there's some foreign bodies
there<00:03:24.260> that<00:03:24.470> have<00:03:24.560> worn<00:03:24.769> off<00:03:24.980> from<00:03:25.549> different

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:25.970 
there that have worn off from different

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:30.009 
there that have worn off from different
places<00:03:27.459> if<00:03:28.459> we<00:03:28.579> just<00:03:28.730> go<00:03:28.879> back<00:03:29.120> to<00:03:29.329> the<00:03:29.540> clutch

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:30.019 
places if we just go back to the clutch

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:31.990 
places if we just go back to the clutch
a<00:03:30.230> and<00:03:30.349> B<00:03:30.530> that<00:03:30.859> is<00:03:31.160> where<00:03:31.489> one<00:03:31.790> of<00:03:31.910> the

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:32.000 
a and B that is where one of the

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.360 
a and B that is where one of the
problems<00:03:32.540> is<00:03:32.930> I'll<00:03:33.349> show<00:03:33.379> you<00:03:33.620> later<00:03:33.859> what's

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:34.370 
problems is I'll show you later what's

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:36.939 
problems is I'll show you later what's
happened<00:03:34.790> inside<00:03:35.209> that<00:03:35.269> hub<00:03:35.900> but<00:03:36.709> there<00:03:36.829> is

00:03:36.939 --> 00:03:36.949 
happened inside that hub but there is

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:39.819 
happened inside that hub but there is
definitely<00:03:37.370> a<00:03:37.400> problem<00:03:37.549> there<00:03:38.500> anyway<00:03:39.500> we

00:03:39.819 --> 00:03:39.829 
definitely a problem there anyway we

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:42.819 
definitely a problem there anyway we
save<00:03:40.040> that<00:03:40.069> to<00:03:40.400> next<00:03:40.669> time
