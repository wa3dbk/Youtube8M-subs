00:00:00.079 --> 00:00:09.320
 hello youtube guys just look at you guys 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:14.190
 the staff is having a hard time 

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:17.100
 is to have better sound quality in your 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.260
 notebook I was researching now 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.529
 in the morning and the staff talk a lot 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:27.060
 respect to some codex that exist and 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:28.619
 in fact staff there was great is great 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:32.550
 part of comments there the staff 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:35.130
 solves this type of problem with these 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.070
 hunt ter speakers and so on 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:39.540
 because codecs actually 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:45.090
 will not solve the problem of the question 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:48.539
 how much you can increase the sound 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.590
 on your notebook on your computer, and 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:53.100
 so on 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:55.590
 okay so it's the simple way I 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.600
 was I was looking for something 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:02.579
 to be able to solve this type of 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:04.470
 issue and I ended up solving the problem 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:09.330
 the way I'll show you 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:13.520
 I'll do it, I'll put the music that 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.520
 any song has a thing on youtube 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:25.640
 I solved the volume problem one 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.640
 greater gain 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.659
 ae 

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:04.500
 beauty guys this is how it's solved 

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:07.830
 this is a question of if you want a little 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:11.820
 more volume on your notebook 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:14.070
 Do as you and I will not go any further. 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:16.200
 and with a notebook that plays so 

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:19.080
 softly and when you play you loose 

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.370
 Your songs, sir. Your video of yours. 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:24.050
 movie so on 

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.050
 A hug ever
