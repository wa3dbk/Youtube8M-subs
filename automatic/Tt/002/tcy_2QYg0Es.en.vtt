how to create Daffy Duck so here we are
my<00:00:22.100> barracks<00:00:22.460> so<00:00:22.670> I'm<00:00:22.820> just<00:00:22.970> gonna<00:00:23.090> go<00:00:23.300> into<00:00:23.480> it

my barracks so I'm just gonna go into it
and<00:00:23.779> I'm<00:00:23.900> going<00:00:24.080> to<00:00:24.140> show<00:00:24.290> you<00:00:24.350> how<00:00:24.680> to<00:00:24.910> make

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:25.910 
and I'm going to show you how to make

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:29.019 
and I'm going to show you how to make
that<00:00:26.119> and<00:00:26.450> so<00:00:26.990> basically<00:00:27.439> on<00:00:27.800> your<00:00:27.860> layer<00:00:28.700> 1

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:29.029 
that and so basically on your layer 1

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:32.650 
that and so basically on your layer 1
you<00:00:29.930> just<00:00:29.960> want<00:00:30.500> to<00:00:30.590> start<00:00:31.250> with<00:00:31.520> you<00:00:32.450> know<00:00:32.540> the

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:32.660 
you just want to start with you know the

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:35.979 
you just want to start with you know the
back<00:00:32.810> layer<00:00:33.050> so<00:00:33.950> that<00:00:34.160> would<00:00:34.340> be<00:00:34.550> the<00:00:35.390> round

00:00:35.979 --> 00:00:35.989 
back layer so that would be the round

00:00:35.989 --> 00:00:37.660 
back layer so that would be the round
Square<00:00:36.290> and<00:00:36.739> we<00:00:36.829> doesn't<00:00:37.130> really<00:00:37.310> matter<00:00:37.520> what

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:37.670 
Square and we doesn't really matter what

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:39.250 
Square and we doesn't really matter what
color<00:00:37.880> you<00:00:38.120> starting<00:00:38.540> on<00:00:38.630> the<00:00:38.750> background<00:00:39.140> but

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:39.260 
color you starting on the background but

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:40.600 
color you starting on the background but
it's<00:00:39.410> just<00:00:39.470> a<00:00:39.620> little<00:00:39.829> bit<00:00:39.920> helpful<00:00:40.160> so<00:00:40.520> you

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:40.610 
it's just a little bit helpful so you

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:42.819 
it's just a little bit helpful so you
can<00:00:40.760> get<00:00:40.910> a<00:00:40.940> bit<00:00:41.149> of<00:00:41.239> a<00:00:41.300> shape<00:00:41.570> on<00:00:41.840> how<00:00:42.530> to<00:00:42.590> do

00:00:42.819 --> 00:00:42.829 
can get a bit of a shape on how to do

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:43.210 
can get a bit of a shape on how to do
that

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:43.220 
that

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:46.540 
that
now<00:00:43.640> on<00:00:43.970> layer<00:00:44.330> 2<00:00:44.480> would<00:00:45.200> be<00:00:45.500> the<00:00:45.860> start<00:00:46.310> of<00:00:46.370> his

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:46.550 
now on layer 2 would be the start of his

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.120 
now on layer 2 would be the start of his
head<00:00:46.760> so<00:00:47.690> you<00:00:47.750> want<00:00:48.020> to<00:00:48.110> choose<00:00:48.320> the<00:00:48.650> tongue

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:49.130 
head so you want to choose the tongue

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:52.240 
head so you want to choose the tongue
and<00:00:49.430> the<00:00:49.610> default<00:00:50.000> emblem<00:00:50.860> which<00:00:51.860> would<00:00:52.010> be<00:00:52.100> on

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:52.250 
and the default emblem which would be on

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.480 
and the default emblem which would be on
Tools<00:00:52.520> and<00:00:52.760> obviously<00:00:53.660> just<00:00:54.050> I<00:00:54.230> push<00:00:54.890> X<00:00:55.160> on<00:00:55.340> it

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.610 
free sky lit and now for the beak I have
used<00:01:00.200> on<00:01:00.470> level<00:01:00.800> fruit<00:01:01.040> layer<00:01:01.610> 3<00:01:02.090> and<00:01:02.270> 4<00:01:02.660> would

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:03.620 
used on level fruit layer 3 and 4 would

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:05.469 
used on level fruit layer 3 and 4 would
be<00:01:03.680> to<00:01:04.100> half<00:01:04.339> circle<00:01:04.790> so<00:01:04.939> you<00:01:04.970> just<00:01:05.210> want<00:01:05.420> to

00:01:05.469 --> 00:01:05.479 
be to half circle so you just want to

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:09.100 
be to half circle so you just want to
reshape<00:01:05.659> and<00:01:06.140> resize<00:01:06.560> that<00:01:06.830> and<00:01:07.750> it<00:01:08.750> obviously

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
that will give you the shape on the two

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:14.800 
that will give you the shape on the two
sides<00:01:12.350> of<00:01:12.500> that<00:01:12.650> now<00:01:13.490> for<00:01:13.880> the<00:01:14.150> side<00:01:14.540> of<00:01:14.570> his

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:14.810 
sides of that now for the side of his

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.899 
sides of that now for the side of his
beaks<00:01:15.110> I<00:01:15.439> have<00:01:15.860> actually<00:01:16.340> gone<00:01:16.700> with<00:01:17.030> the

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:18.909 
beaks I have actually gone with the

00:01:18.909 --> 00:01:21.940 
beaks I have actually gone with the
what's<00:01:19.909> called<00:01:20.150> now<00:01:20.330> the<00:01:20.900> rock<00:01:21.350> shadow<00:01:21.620> so

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:21.950 
what's called now the rock shadow so

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:23.350 
what's called now the rock shadow so
that<00:01:22.100> would<00:01:22.190> be<00:01:22.310> the<00:01:22.460> front<00:01:22.730> or<00:01:22.940> the<00:01:23.090> side<00:01:23.180> of

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360 
that would be the front or the side of

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.320 
that would be the front or the side of
his<00:01:23.600> beak<00:01:23.810> and<00:01:24.080> on<00:01:24.800> the<00:01:24.950> side<00:01:25.159> is<00:01:25.460> the<00:01:25.820> Gulf

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:26.330 
his beak and on the side is the Gulf

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.170 
his beak and on the side is the Gulf
flag<00:01:26.890> not<00:01:27.890> not<00:01:28.460> the<00:01:28.580> one<00:01:28.700> that's<00:01:28.850> not<00:01:28.940> that

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.180 
flag not not the one that's not that

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.410 
flag not not the one that's not that
mean<00:01:29.360> obviously<00:01:29.720> and<00:01:30.590> layer<00:01:31.340> 7<00:01:31.880> would<00:01:32.180> give

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:32.420 
mean obviously and layer 7 would give

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:33.910 
mean obviously and layer 7 would give
you<00:01:32.540> the<00:01:32.659> front<00:01:32.810> of<00:01:32.960> the<00:01:33.050> beat<00:01:33.200> which<00:01:33.470> is<00:01:33.500> the

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
you the front of the beat which is the

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.240 
you the front of the beat which is the
quarter<00:01:34.340> circle<00:01:34.600> but<00:01:35.600> again<00:01:36.020> just<00:01:36.440> push<00:01:36.650> X<00:01:36.920> and

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:37.250 
quarter circle but again just push X and

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.070 
quarter circle but again just push X and
I'll<00:01:37.670> free<00:01:37.940> that<00:01:38.150> just<00:01:38.360> a<00:01:38.420> free<00:01:38.630> sketch<00:01:38.870> just

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:39.080 
I'll free that just a free sketch just

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.800 
I'll free that just a free sketch just
to<00:01:39.229> stretch<00:01:39.500> it<00:01:39.650> out<00:01:39.740> a<00:01:39.800> little<00:01:40.040> bit<00:01:40.280> more<00:01:40.810> now

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810 
to stretch it out a little bit more now

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.000 
to stretch it out a little bit more now
for<00:01:41.960> the<00:01:42.409> on<00:01:43.070> layer<00:01:43.460> 8<00:01:43.790> &amp;<00:01:44.150> 9<00:01:44.290> it<00:01:45.290> gives<00:01:45.530> you<00:01:45.740> the

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:46.010 
for the on layer 8 &amp; 9 it gives you the

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:48.880 
for the on layer 8 &amp; 9 it gives you the
two<00:01:46.370> sides<00:01:46.700> of<00:01:46.850> the<00:01:46.970> beak<00:01:47.260> so<00:01:48.260> you<00:01:48.680> basically

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:48.890 
two sides of the beak so you basically

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.680 
two sides of the beak so you basically
have<00:01:49.280> the<00:01:50.650> so<00:01:51.650> smart<00:01:52.100> outline<00:01:52.580> it's<00:01:52.880> called<00:01:53.120> so

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:53.690 
have the so smart outline it's called so

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:56.170 
have the so smart outline it's called so
just<00:01:54.260> again<00:01:54.530> just<00:01:54.860> push<00:01:55.010> X<00:01:55.280> I'll<00:01:55.640> free<00:01:55.940> that<00:01:56.090> so

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.180 
just again just push X I'll free that so

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.300 
just again just push X I'll free that so
you<00:01:56.270> can<00:01:56.420> free<00:01:56.720> scale<00:01:57.110> it<00:01:57.320> and<00:01:57.530> that<00:01:58.130> would

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
you can free scale it and that would

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.359 
you can free scale it and that would
give<00:01:58.520> you<00:01:58.700> the<00:01:59.140> obviously<00:02:00.140> latouche<00:02:00.500> two

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:01.369 
give you the obviously latouche two

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:02.890 
give you the obviously latouche two
lines<00:02:01.610> of<00:02:01.700> link<00:02:01.940> so<00:02:02.000> it<00:02:02.090> looks<00:02:02.270> like<00:02:02.420> it's<00:02:02.659> more

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:02.900 
lines of link so it looks like it's more

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.380
