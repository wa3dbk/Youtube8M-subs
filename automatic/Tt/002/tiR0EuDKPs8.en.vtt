two ounces of household sudsy ammonia

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:44.389

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
but we're going to do four ounces

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:46.790 
but we're going to do four ounces
because<00:00:44.640> in<00:00:45.270> this<00:00:45.450> particular<00:00:46.110> job<00:00:46.379> we<00:00:46.620> have

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:46.800 
because in this particular job we have

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.010 
because in this particular job we have
quite<00:00:47.100> a<00:00:47.129> lot<00:00:47.370> of<00:00:47.520> red<00:00:47.789> dye<00:00:48.000> stains<00:00:48.420> and

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.020 
quite a lot of red dye stains and

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.950 
quite a lot of red dye stains and
instead<00:00:49.800> of<00:00:49.920> using<00:00:50.129> household<00:00:50.850> sudsy<00:00:51.449> ammonia

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
instead of using household sudsy ammonia

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.619 
instead of using household sudsy ammonia
the<00:00:52.649> master<00:00:53.219> blend<00:00:53.460> upholstery<00:00:54.000> priest<00:00:54.390> ray

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
the master blend upholstery priest ray

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.319 
the master blend upholstery priest ray
already<00:00:54.989> does<00:00:55.350> have<00:00:55.739> some<00:00:56.129> ammonia<00:00:56.789> in<00:00:56.940> it<00:00:56.969> and

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
already does have some ammonia in it and

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.720 
already does have some ammonia in it and
so<00:00:57.960> it's<00:00:58.140> just<00:00:58.199> a<00:00:58.440> little<00:00:58.680> bit<00:00:58.859> handier<00:00:59.370> then

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
so it's just a little bit handier then

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.420 
so it's just a little bit handier then
making<00:01:00.300> a<00:01:00.539> trip<00:01:00.809> to<00:01:00.840> the<00:01:00.989> supermarket<00:01:01.469> so

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:02.430 
making a trip to the supermarket so

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.549 
making a trip to the supermarket so
we're<00:01:02.640> gonna<00:01:02.789> mix<00:01:03.090> that<00:01:03.300> material<00:01:04.019> up<00:01:04.229> and

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
we're gonna mix that material up and

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.910 
we're gonna mix that material up and
apply<00:01:05.460> it<00:01:05.519> to<00:01:05.820> our<00:01:05.850> red<00:01:06.210> dye<00:01:06.510> stain<00:01:06.960> but<00:01:07.740> it

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
apply it to our red dye stain but it

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.690 
apply it to our red dye stain but it
will<00:01:08.189> need<00:01:08.460> some<00:01:09.090> heat<00:01:09.390> to<00:01:09.630> accelerate<00:01:10.290> it

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:13.700 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:17.690 

just<00:01:14.700> apply<00:01:15.090> the<00:01:15.150> material<00:01:15.750> to<00:01:16.040> the<00:01:17.040> red<00:01:17.340> stain

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
just apply the material to the red stain

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.940 
just apply the material to the red stain
in<00:01:17.970> this<00:01:18.090> case<00:01:18.330> it<00:01:18.570> happens<00:01:18.930> to<00:01:19.110> be<00:01:19.140> cherry

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
in this case it happens to be cherry

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:28.399 
in this case it happens to be cherry
kool-aid<00:01:24.320> and<00:01:25.320> it<00:01:25.530> does<00:01:25.799> take<00:01:26.130> some<00:01:27.020> heat<00:01:28.020> to

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:28.409 
kool-aid and it does take some heat to

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:30.499 
kool-aid and it does take some heat to
accelerate<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.310> product<00:01:29.759> to<00:01:29.880> get<00:01:30.030> it<00:01:30.180> to<00:01:30.329> work

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
accelerate the product to get it to work

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.690 
accelerate the product to get it to work
