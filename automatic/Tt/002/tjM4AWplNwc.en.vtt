00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:12.450
 today we have a different scenario 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:15.120
 He is in my joke this time. 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:19.470
 to also talk about a different theme 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:22.140
 that's how to make yours is at home 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.330
 I think it's a really cool thing, I do not 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.060
 Comes from work so the super cabala 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.519
 tired self-esteem on the ground with the skin 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.500
 Bad hair I think nothing better than 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:36.200
 for you to recover from that sock 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.200
 time when you only do it yourself 

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:44.340
 continuing is our videos and who is going 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.860
 stay at home, now I'll talk, it's 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.980
 and silver in his face spoke 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:53.309
 the video is of products through the body 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.230
 so now face is I also think 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.390
 very cool face choose how you 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.090
 have that day of doing everything with more 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:02.309
 I take care of you every week 

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:05.220
 exfoliate cool because it removes cells 

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.740
 of the skin leaves the skin a bit 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.409
 brighter and leaves it is more 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:12.840
 susceptible to absorb the nutrients of 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:16.110
 a cream that was last I use this 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:19.110
 exfoliating here on progeny front well 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:23.210
 levinho call I also won in 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.210
 mation silver studs 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:30.270
 the booth shop and also has a 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:32.880
 other weight of the current maximum has water 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:37.640
 thermal pool would also not choose 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:40.860
 the proposed soft and also I have this 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.940
 daley that mimics that 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.340
 with aggression 

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:45.960
 I also explain my skin 

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.000
 he thought it was cool for him to feel 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.610
 more time if you want to take better care of the 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.530
 face skin 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:56.220
 so for one more line is in 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:58.470
 home even i love mask you have 

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:01.830
 he has a fascination with the mask if 

00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:05.220
 could produce this here is a 

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:08.520
 This is Roberto Roberto that I did in a cvs 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:09.989
 Daniela Flame in the boy is a trademark of 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.720
 Finland had never seen it in my 

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:15.209
 life but the seller of things that was 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:17.489
 good for oily skin because it with 

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:20.730
 continuous use, it decreases the 

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:22.350
 skin is really like this is very good I 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.170
 I ended up using a couple of times per 

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:28.200
 week is allowed ten minutes at the face in 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:31.890
 Closed poles stay less bright 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:35.400
 body is also has a mud mask 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:37.980
 the dead sea and the other video everything is 

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.830
 color because I brought it there, I 'm sick of it 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:44.310
 jordan is a mafia a little bit more 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:46.140
 heavy because it is the same mud 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:48.650
 the line you want a little bit more 

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:51.630
 work is very good too 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:54.000
 so the benefits of mud mask 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:55.680
 there really is not much at all 

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.830
 Concrete I think you'll do when 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:00.360
 You feel that it made an effect on her. 

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:04.410
 time is a little bit easier 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:06.989
 series and then I bought this one from here until 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:10.920
 now I do not know really did effect 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:12.900
 but the promise is a white clay of 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.430
 uniform the skin tone and I found 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.010
 very cool because every once in a while I 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:20.100
 I feel a difference of tonality and 

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:21.540
 someone in a charming little pot that is all 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:24.860
 nice too 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:28.980
 this sword thing is the story ball 

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:31.319
 he has a really nice store itself is 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:34.380
 another mask that I usually do that 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:36.599
 I even made a video about it putting the 

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:39.599
 people is also that mask 

00:03:36.599 --> 00:03:42.840
 mixes the hypoglossal and 

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:45.590
 asked super easy access 

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.670
 make and it leaves the skin more moisturized 

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:51.799
 gives a firmness 

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:54.690
 It's very cool, they 're finishing the mask. 

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:56.430
 I always clean the skin after 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:58.980
 of a skin exfoliation of the mask and 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:00.690
 ends up culminating with a solar producer 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:03.780
 with the moisturizer 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:06.000
 usually the dance hesitation is that a 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:08.730
 gel for oily skins but he has six 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.040
 hours of hydration so that the mayor 

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:13.790
 which affects my 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:18.229
 Looks great and also shows 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:21.859
 you and the city they had exchange 

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:24.620
 crazy to stay home so it is a kind 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:28.220
 an eye gel pouch 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:29.960
 He told me that in the eye area. 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:31.759
 Actually I think I put him in more 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:34.550
 pretending you're doing effect 

00:04:31.759 --> 00:04:38.600
 any cut or one that is simple 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:39.979
 is not but anyway it's really cool one 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:42.349
 thing that I end up using a polymer 

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:46.610
 every Friday 

00:04:42.349 --> 00:04:48.860
 Good, that's my routine, Dad says. 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:51.020
 parts have liked and if you have 

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:55.240
 doubt leave in the comments we go 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:55.240
 take outside good kiss and even exchange
