00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 
another thing you have to think about is

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:32.770 
another thing you have to think about is
how<00:01:31.310> exactly<00:01:31.820> are<00:01:31.909> you<00:01:32.060> going<00:01:32.210> to<00:01:32.390> wear<00:01:32.420> the

how exactly are you going to wear the
Fedora<00:01:33.429> are<00:01:34.429> you<00:01:34.640> trying<00:01:34.939> to<00:01:35.030> look<00:01:35.859> just

00:01:36.849 --> 00:01:36.859 
Fedora are you trying to look just

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:41.249 
Fedora are you trying to look just
stylish<00:01:37.810> are<00:01:38.810> you<00:01:38.929> trying<00:01:39.229> to<00:01:39.319> look<00:01:39.700> dapper

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:43.719 
stylish are you trying to look dapper
it's<00:01:42.259> also<00:01:42.500> important<00:01:43.009> to<00:01:43.039> think<00:01:43.189> about<00:01:43.310> what

00:01:43.719 --> 00:01:43.729 
it's also important to think about what

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:45.910 
it's also important to think about what
you<00:01:43.909> were<00:01:44.030> wearing<00:01:44.240> with<00:01:44.569> the<00:01:44.600> Fedora<00:01:45.020> because

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:45.920 
you were wearing with the Fedora because

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.679 
you were wearing with the Fedora because
I<00:01:46.039> would<00:01:46.159> probably<00:01:46.490> not<00:01:46.640> wear<00:01:46.909> a<00:01:47.209> shirt<00:01:47.630> like

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:47.689 
I would probably not wear a shirt like

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:52.480 
I would probably not wear a shirt like
this<00:01:47.899> with<00:01:48.770> the<00:01:48.890> Fedora<00:01:50.799> patterns<00:01:51.799> just<00:01:52.130> tend

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
this with the Fedora patterns just tend

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:57.029 
this with the Fedora patterns just tend
to<00:01:52.810> not<00:01:53.810> go<00:01:53.990> quite<00:01:54.229> as<00:01:54.259> well<00:01:54.500> with<00:01:54.649> a<00:01:54.740> fedora

00:01:57.029 --> 00:01:57.039 

00:01:57.039 --> 00:02:00.969 

and<00:01:58.039> also<00:01:58.609> t-shirts<00:01:59.149> I<00:01:59.600> would<00:02:00.470> not<00:02:00.649> advise

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:00.979 
and also t-shirts I would not advise

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:04.149 
and also t-shirts I would not advise
people<00:02:01.549> to<00:02:01.729> wear<00:02:02.060> t-shirts<00:02:02.630> but<00:02:03.349> I'm<00:02:03.799> sure

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:04.159 
people to wear t-shirts but I'm sure

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:05.800 
people to wear t-shirts but I'm sure
there<00:02:04.310> might<00:02:04.489> be<00:02:04.549> a<00:02:04.729> couple<00:02:05.030> t-shirts<00:02:05.569> out

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
there might be a couple t-shirts out

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.620 
there might be a couple t-shirts out
there<00:02:05.989> that<00:02:06.200> would<00:02:06.409> work<00:02:06.909> but<00:02:07.909> overall<00:02:08.569> I

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
there that would work but overall I

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:12.900 
there that would work but overall I
would<00:02:08.840> advise<00:02:09.709> staying<00:02:10.640> away<00:02:10.880> from<00:02:10.910> fedoras

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:12.910 
would advise staying away from fedoras

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:15.640 
would advise staying away from fedoras

sense of style not meaning offense to
the<00:02:31.879> Amish<00:02:32.030> not<00:02:32.870> that<00:02:33.019> they<00:02:33.109> will<00:02:33.260> ever<00:02:33.380> see

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:33.739 
the Amish not that they will ever see

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:36.670 
the Amish not that they will ever see
this<00:02:34.630> you<00:02:35.630> know<00:02:35.750> because<00:02:36.200> the<00:02:36.319> Amish<00:02:36.560> people

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
this you know because the Amish people

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.550 
this you know because the Amish people
don't<00:02:36.859> even<00:02:37.100> have<00:02:37.280> electricity<00:02:37.459> so<00:02:38.560> they'll

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
don't even have electricity so they'll

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:44.650 
don't even have electricity so they'll
never<00:02:39.709> see<00:02:39.980> this<00:02:40.130> I<00:02:41.019> hope<00:02:43.359> otherwise<00:02:44.359> I'll

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
never see this I hope otherwise I'll

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.710 
never see this I hope otherwise I'll
have<00:02:44.810> a<00:02:44.840> lot<00:02:44.989> of<00:02:45.019> angry<00:02:45.290> Amish<00:02:45.590> people<00:02:46.720> compare

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
have a lot of angry Amish people compare

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.319 
have a lot of angry Amish people compare
this<00:02:47.870> to<00:02:48.049> what<00:02:48.079> I<00:02:48.230> was<00:02:48.349> wearing<00:02:48.530> before<00:02:49.329> this

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:50.329 
this to what I was wearing before this

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:52.690 
this to what I was wearing before this
looks<00:02:50.630> miles<00:02:50.870> better<00:02:51.170> and<00:02:51.500> I<00:02:52.190> just<00:02:52.370> threw<00:02:52.579> this

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
looks miles better and I just threw this

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.900 
looks miles better and I just threw this
together<00:02:52.849> in<00:02:53.180> like<00:02:53.299> 30<00:02:53.569> seconds<00:02:54.069> so<00:02:55.069> imagine

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:55.910 
together in like 30 seconds so imagine

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:58.360 
together in like 30 seconds so imagine
if<00:02:56.000> somebody<00:02:56.299> actually<00:02:56.569> tried<00:02:57.049> the<00:02:57.980> black<00:02:58.220> of

00:02:58.360 --> 00:02:58.370 
if somebody actually tried the black of

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:01.020 
if somebody actually tried the black of
the<00:02:58.489> hat<00:02:58.669> goes<00:02:58.940> with<00:02:59.450> the<00:02:59.569> jacket<00:02:59.840> and<00:03:00.139> the

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:01.030 
the hat goes with the jacket and the

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.379 
the hat goes with the jacket and the
shirt<00:03:02.030> adds<00:03:02.389> enough<00:03:03.200> sophistication<00:03:03.889> that

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:04.389 
shirt adds enough sophistication that

00:03:04.389 --> 00:03:07.110 
shirt adds enough sophistication that
the<00:03:05.389> hat<00:03:05.569> also<00:03:06.049> adds<00:03:06.200> sophistication

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:07.120 
the hat also adds sophistication

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.080 
the hat also adds sophistication
compared<00:03:08.120> with<00:03:08.840> and<00:03:09.139> without<00:03:09.620> that<00:03:10.090> which

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
compared with and without that which

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.960 
compared with and without that which
looks<00:03:11.450> more<00:03:11.930> sophisticated<00:03:12.709> it<00:03:13.579> might<00:03:13.790> not<00:03:13.910> be

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970 
looks more sophisticated it might not be

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:18.580 
looks more sophisticated it might not be
that<00:03:14.569> great<00:03:15.049> of<00:03:15.260> a<00:03:15.290> difference<00:03:15.650> but<00:03:16.090> the<00:03:17.590> Hat

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590 
that great of a difference but the Hat

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.550 
that great of a difference but the Hat
probably<00:03:18.970> looks<00:03:19.970> more<00:03:20.720> sophisticated<00:03:21.319> in

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
probably looks more sophisticated in

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.260 
probably looks more sophisticated in
general

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:25.270 

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:29.080
