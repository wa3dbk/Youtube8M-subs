to<00:01:29.150> see<00:01:29.420> how<00:01:29.600> it<00:01:29.750> works<00:01:29.990> I<00:01:30.380> was<00:01:31.009> hoping<00:01:31.369> the

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
to see how it works I was hoping the

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:32.859 
to see how it works I was hoping the

longer<00:01:33.439> than<00:01:33.560> it<00:01:33.799> did<00:01:33.950> because<00:01:34.340> I<00:01:34.369> would<00:01:34.579> have

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:34.700 
longer than it did because I would have

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.190 
longer than it did because I would have
really<00:01:35.000> liked<00:01:35.210> to<00:01:35.390> take<00:01:35.600> a<00:01:35.630> look<00:01:35.840> underneath

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:36.200 
really liked to take a look underneath

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.530 
really liked to take a look underneath
the<00:01:36.409> bonnet<00:01:36.590> they<00:01:37.549> didn't<00:01:37.759> even<00:01:37.909> land<00:01:38.149> in<00:01:38.390> the

the bonnet they didn't even land in the
end<00:01:38.689> which<00:01:39.079> is<00:01:39.200> a<00:01:39.320> shame<00:01:39.500> because<00:01:39.710> I<00:01:39.950> had

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:40.070 
end which is a shame because I had

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:42.370 
end which is a shame because I had
enough<00:01:40.310> questions<00:01:40.790> I<00:01:41.119> was<00:01:41.960> going<00:01:42.140> to<00:01:42.229> change
