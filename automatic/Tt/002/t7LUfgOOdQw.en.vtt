your Vanda orchid - bloom is simply

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.890 
your Vanda orchid - bloom is simply
because<00:04:18.769> it's<00:04:18.979> not<00:04:19.070> mature<00:04:19.400> yet<00:04:19.880> now<00:04:20.510> this<00:04:20.720> is

00:04:20.890 --> 00:04:20.900 
because it's not mature yet now this is

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:23.290 
because it's not mature yet now this is
where<00:04:21.080> a<00:04:21.289> name<00:04:21.590> tag<00:04:21.919> actually<00:04:22.400> comes<00:04:22.640> handy<00:04:23.120> if

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:23.300 
where a name tag actually comes handy if

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:25.420 
where a name tag actually comes handy if
you<00:04:23.780> know<00:04:24.050> what<00:04:24.260> your<00:04:24.440> orchid<00:04:24.860> is<00:04:24.979> do

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:25.430 
you know what your orchid is do

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:28.090 
you know what your orchid is do
research<00:04:25.880> and<00:04:26.150> see<00:04:26.479> how<00:04:26.990> tall<00:04:27.500> the<00:04:27.740> circuit

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:28.100 
research and see how tall the circuit

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:30.430 
research and see how tall the circuit
needs<00:04:28.310> to<00:04:28.490> be<00:04:28.610> before<00:04:28.820> it<00:04:29.090> can<00:04:29.479> bloom<00:04:29.720> there

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:30.440 
needs to be before it can bloom there

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:32.590 
needs to be before it can bloom there
are<00:04:30.590> some<00:04:30.860> species<00:04:31.220> that<00:04:31.610> need<00:04:31.790> to<00:04:31.970> be<00:04:32.000> quite

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:32.600 
are some species that need to be quite

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:34.540 
are some species that need to be quite
tall<00:04:32.990> before<00:04:33.470> they<00:04:33.620> can<00:04:33.800> bloom<00:04:34.039> like<00:04:34.310> that

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:34.550 
tall before they can bloom like that

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:37.270 
tall before they can bloom like that
hybrid<00:04:34.820> over<00:04:35.240> there<00:04:35.449> and<00:04:35.690> some<00:04:36.289> species<00:04:36.620> like

00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:37.280 
hybrid over there and some species like

orchid hopefully you can see now there

00:04:48.259 --> 00:04:50.230 
orchid hopefully you can see now there
are<00:04:48.410> found<00:04:48.650> orchids<00:04:49.190> that<00:04:49.310> are<00:04:49.610> very<00:04:49.910> very

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:50.240 
are found orchids that are very very

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:53.200 
are found orchids that are very very
young<00:04:50.539> if<00:04:50.780> they<00:04:51.110> look<00:04:51.500> like<00:04:51.770> this<00:04:52.210> especially

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:53.210 
young if they look like this especially

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:54.969 
young if they look like this especially
the<00:04:53.360> complex<00:04:53.780> hybrids<00:04:54.259> or<00:04:54.440> the<00:04:54.590> proper

00:04:54.969 --> 00:04:54.979 
the complex hybrids or the proper

00:04:54.979 --> 00:04:57.730 
the complex hybrids or the proper
vanda's<00:04:55.430> this<00:04:55.820> is<00:04:56.120> a<00:04:56.180> wrinkled<00:04:56.960> Reedus<00:04:57.380> it<00:04:57.620> is

00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:57.740 
vanda's this is a wrinkled Reedus it is

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:00.340 
vanda's this is a wrinkled Reedus it is
a<00:04:57.979> hybrid<00:04:58.520> and<00:04:58.729> wrinkled<00:04:59.419> stylist<00:04:59.840> in<00:05:00.020> general

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:00.350 
a hybrid and wrinkled stylist in general

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:03.310 
a hybrid and wrinkled stylist in general
is<00:05:00.530> not<00:05:01.070> very<00:05:01.610> tall<00:05:02.120> so<00:05:02.510> it<00:05:02.630> can<00:05:02.810> bloom<00:05:02.990> at

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:03.320 
is not very tall so it can bloom at

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:05.260 
is not very tall so it can bloom at
smaller<00:05:03.680> sizes<00:05:04.070> and<00:05:04.490> this<00:05:04.850> is<00:05:04.970> why<00:05:05.090> this

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:05.270 
smaller sizes and this is why this

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:07.480 
smaller sizes and this is why this
orchid<00:05:05.630> can<00:05:05.990> bloom<00:05:06.320> but<00:05:06.770> if<00:05:06.919> this<00:05:07.100> work<00:05:07.310> it

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:07.490 
orchid can bloom but if this work it

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:09.189 
orchid can bloom but if this work it
would<00:05:07.639> have<00:05:07.760> been<00:05:07.970> Avantika<00:05:08.389> Chara<00:05:08.840> delight

00:05:09.189 --> 00:05:09.199 
would have been Avantika Chara delight

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:11.500 
would have been Avantika Chara delight
like<00:05:09.500> that<00:05:09.740> one<00:05:10.010> it<00:05:10.490> would<00:05:10.729> be<00:05:10.880> very<00:05:11.150> very

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:11.510 
like that one it would be very very

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:13.420 
like that one it would be very very
young<00:05:11.810> and<00:05:12.020> I<00:05:12.199> would<00:05:12.350> have<00:05:12.500> to<00:05:12.650> wait<00:05:12.800> another<00:05:13.039> 3

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:13.430 
young and I would have to wait another 3

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:15.189 
young and I would have to wait another 3
years<00:05:13.460> where<00:05:13.970> the<00:05:14.090> circuit<00:05:14.449> to<00:05:14.479> become<00:05:14.900> mature

00:05:15.189 --> 00:05:15.199 
years where the circuit to become mature

00:05:15.199 --> 00:05:17.230 
years where the circuit to become mature
and<00:05:15.350> actually<00:05:15.710> bloom<00:05:15.979> so<00:05:16.490> make<00:05:16.849> sure<00:05:16.880> your

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:17.240 
and actually bloom so make sure your

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:20.050 
and actually bloom so make sure your
orchid<00:05:17.630> is<00:05:17.840> mature<00:05:18.289> enough<00:05:18.320> before<00:05:18.949> you<00:05:19.160> start

00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:20.060 
orchid is mature enough before you start

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:22.089 
orchid is mature enough before you start
to<00:05:20.210> panic<00:05:20.449> on<00:05:20.840> why<00:05:21.229> your<00:05:21.440> orchid<00:05:21.800> doesn't

00:05:22.089 --> 00:05:22.099 
to panic on why your orchid doesn't

00:05:22.099 --> 00:05:24.460 
to panic on why your orchid doesn't
bloom<00:05:22.250> and<00:05:22.490> finally<00:05:23.210> the<00:05:23.360> last<00:05:23.509> major<00:05:23.900> reason

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:24.470 
bloom and finally the last major reason

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:26.290 
bloom and finally the last major reason
why<00:05:24.620> your<00:05:24.830> orchid<00:05:25.220> doesn't<00:05:25.610> bloom<00:05:25.789> is<00:05:25.970> that

00:05:26.290 --> 00:05:26.300 
why your orchid doesn't bloom is that

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:28.450 
why your orchid doesn't bloom is that
maybe<00:05:26.509> it's<00:05:26.750> not<00:05:26.930> healthy<00:05:27.470> especially<00:05:27.830> if<00:05:28.340> it

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:28.460 
maybe it's not healthy especially if it

can see if your Vanda orchid is not have
roots<00:05:40.370> and<00:05:40.639> does<00:05:40.760> not<00:05:41.000> receive<00:05:41.360> enough

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:41.690 
roots and does not receive enough

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:44.200 
roots and does not receive enough
hydration<00:05:42.229> it<00:05:42.650> might<00:05:43.310> be<00:05:43.490> a<00:05:43.520> serious<00:05:43.940> cause

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:44.210 
hydration it might be a serious cause

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:46.149 
hydration it might be a serious cause
for<00:05:44.539> its<00:05:44.750> not<00:05:44.930> blooming<00:05:45.260> but<00:05:45.680> the<00:05:45.770> good<00:05:45.949> news

00:05:46.149 --> 00:05:46.159 
for its not blooming but the good news

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:48.040 
for its not blooming but the good news
is<00:05:46.400> that<00:05:46.669> if<00:05:46.789> you<00:05:46.880> care<00:05:47.060> for<00:05:47.270> it<00:05:47.360> properly<00:05:47.389> the

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:48.050 
is that if you care for it properly the

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:50.560 
is that if you care for it properly the
roots<00:05:48.260> will<00:05:48.470> grow<00:05:48.830> back<00:05:49.159> and<00:05:49.610> eventually<00:05:50.060> it

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:50.570 
roots will grow back and eventually it

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:53.500 
roots will grow back and eventually it
will<00:05:50.840> bloom<00:05:51.110> so<00:05:51.500> health<00:05:51.949> plays<00:05:52.550> a<00:05:52.580> major<00:05:53.330> role

00:05:53.500 --> 00:05:53.510 
will bloom so health plays a major role

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:56.620 
will bloom so health plays a major role
in<00:05:53.930> blooming<00:05:54.860> a<00:05:54.949> Vanda<00:05:55.250> orchid<00:05:55.639> as<00:05:55.789> well<00:05:56.180> so

obviously just like any other orchid the

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:00.700 
obviously just like any other orchid the
healthier<00:05:58.970> your<00:05:59.180> Vanda<00:05:59.570> is<00:05:59.750> the<00:06:00.080> more<00:06:00.260> chances

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:00.710 
healthier your Vanda is the more chances

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:02.920 
healthier your Vanda is the more chances
it<00:06:00.860> has<00:06:01.010> to<00:06:01.220> actually<00:06:01.340> bloom<00:06:01.789> okay<00:06:02.449> so<00:06:02.510> this<00:06:02.750> is

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:02.930 
it has to actually bloom okay so this is

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:05.020 
it has to actually bloom okay so this is
about<00:06:03.169> it<00:06:03.380> on<00:06:03.530> why<00:06:03.979> Vanda<00:06:04.400> orchids<00:06:04.789> don't

00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:05.030
