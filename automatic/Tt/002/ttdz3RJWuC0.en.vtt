I<00:00:00.089> think<00:00:00.510> we<00:00:00.630> should<00:00:00.659> continue<00:00:01.050> handshake

sometimes in life we don't realize we're

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.660 
sometimes in life we don't realize we're
not<00:00:05.940> anything<00:00:06.480> without<00:00:06.960> an<00:00:07.379> opponent<00:00:07.919> if<00:00:08.519> we

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:08.670 
not anything without an opponent if we

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.480 
not anything without an opponent if we
didn't<00:00:08.849> have<00:00:08.880> somebody<00:00:09.150> to<00:00:09.420> play<00:00:09.450> hillel<00:00:09.990> EP
