 in which he was able to set the pace 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.560
 from early a pretty comfortable rhythm 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:53.989
 passing in 24 the first 400 meters 

00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:55.910
 but in particular more comfortable they were still 

00:00:53.989 --> 00:01:00.350
 the second 400 when the half mile 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:03.140

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:05.600

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:10.610
 sources for 

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:13.430
 to hold by scarcely the neck 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:15.320
 of advantage and time of two minutes five 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:17.750
 seconds and two fifths for the distance 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.670
 of a mile and a quarter third term smart 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.830
 has and fourth came to backus all 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.600
 these representatives of panama in this 

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.250
 event further back fifth came the 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.960
 Venezuelan deals, followed by the 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.670
 also Venezuelan quin white 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.960
 the Puerto Rican hartline field finished in the 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.170
 seventh position 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:35.800
 castelá of representative of mexico 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:38.210
 finished in eighth place and toni you'll be 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:40.060
 representing venezuela arrived in the 

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:42.640
 last position 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:46.750
 let's see next in the reactions 

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:48.850
 of the winners I really feel 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:52.090
 glad that my second triumph is 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:54.460
 on the Caribbean coast it was good 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:56.049
 pretty quiet point I did not have the 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.460
 problem at the moment and the last thing 

00:01:56.049 --> 00:01:59.770
 I'm being pressured into all the practice 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:02.049
 ice with good ballet but not in green 

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:04.060
 title the last attacks step was 

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:06.340
 relatively comfortable 24 and then it happened a 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.929
 49 1 so you could relax it very 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.450
 okay those seconds 400 less and it's 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:11.920
 really horse is now well and 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.350
 well I think that was the factor that 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.120
 I can get to the last until 

00:02:14.350 --> 00:02:19.620
 get to the finish line the track is pretty 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:22.709
 light flattering for speed 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:24.360
 it may be after that after a 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:25.920
 horse do not go scampering I think that 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:28.349
 the speed while you go 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:30.780
 ahead it's going to be quite difficult to catch 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:32.670
 a carrerón I had done everything had 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.730
 many accesses mouth if you go ahead is 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.019
 grows I understand what I'm going to look for 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.640
 they gave him a lot of know that separates forward 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:40.489
 professional they were quite as I knew 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:43.379
 that it was going to be easier this time 

00:02:40.489 --> 00:02:45.420
 would indicate what the amounts 20 that 

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:47.670
 fell a second third race not 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:49.230
 we improvise with one I think so 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:50.400
 I knew a little bit more about the bike 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.440
 so two have found several 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.940
 times and it has generated mutually not you 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.500
 surprised the first and second here not 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.280
 we had already done control question 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.959
 of game 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.030
 let's say 123 with down that came from 

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:01.819
 fourth and sometimes the last three 

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:03.900
 times they have run they have won 12 

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:05.730
 We chat with jockey Juan Carlos 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.829
 diaz who rode the exemplary france 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:09.150
 In this test, let's listen to what 

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:12.510
 he told us 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:15.720
 Well well horse this match well 

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:19.230
 this place the first curve I had little 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:20.340
 reach in the horse to the game a 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:23.220
 always look for a little bit 

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:25.680
 outward and when they came down that what 

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:27.859
 I put the lane in a little bit 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:30.450
 be a little 

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:33.510
 it's about going out and playing and attitudes 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:36.480
 near the part that was treated after 

00:03:33.510 --> 00:03:38.870
 went up because it was going well is 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.870
 Clear 

00:03:44.239 --> 00:03:51.319
 the second part did not advance 

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:57.940
 It was not going well for the delay in 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:01.480
 curve was a little factor that could 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:03.959
 have given closer but I think not 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.959
 more sonorous
