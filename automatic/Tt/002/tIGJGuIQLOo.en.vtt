folder done and done now there are a few

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.200 
folder done and done now there are a few
recipes<00:00:35.250> that<00:00:35.520> you've<00:00:35.730> actually<00:00:35.850> want<00:00:36.149> to

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
recipes that you've actually want to

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.740 
recipes that you've actually want to
know<00:00:36.300> to<00:00:36.960> specifically<00:00:38.390> one<00:00:39.390> for<00:00:39.660> the

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
know to specifically one for the

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.950 
know to specifically one for the
wireless<00:00:40.100> transmitter<00:00:41.100> and<00:00:41.370> then<00:00:42.180> one<00:00:42.570> for

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
wireless transmitter and then one for

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.380 
wireless transmitter and then one for
the<00:00:43.140> wireless<00:00:43.440> receiver<00:00:44.129> now<00:00:44.550> these<00:00:44.940> recipes

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
the wireless receiver now these recipes

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.420 
the wireless receiver now these recipes
aren't<00:00:45.719> exactly<00:00:46.289> too<00:00:46.530> expensive<00:00:47.100> but<00:00:47.280> then

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
aren't exactly too expensive but then

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.569 
aren't exactly too expensive but then
again<00:00:47.550> if<00:00:48.000> you<00:00:48.300> are<00:00:48.480> low<00:00:48.780> on<00:00:48.809> iron<00:00:49.379> they<00:00:50.340> kind

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
again if you are low on iron they kind

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.700 
again if you are low on iron they kind
of<00:00:50.610> can<00:00:50.820> be<00:00:51.000> so<00:00:51.390> this<00:00:51.570> is<00:00:51.750> kind<00:00:51.989> of<00:00:52.110> not<00:00:52.289> for<00:00:52.620> the

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
of can be so this is kind of not for the

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.260 
of can be so this is kind of not for the
very<00:00:52.949> beginning<00:00:53.370> but<00:00:53.699> this<00:00:53.850> is<00:00:54.000> once<00:00:54.180> you

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
very beginning but this is once you

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.430 
very beginning but this is once you
actually<00:00:54.420> start<00:00:54.660> getting<00:00:54.930> a<00:00:54.989> bit<00:00:55.110> of<00:00:55.199> an<00:00:55.260> iron

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
actually start getting a bit of an iron

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:58.430 
actually start getting a bit of an iron
supply<00:00:55.890> and<00:00:56.390> redstone<00:00:57.390> well<00:00:57.780> we<00:00:57.989> all<00:00:58.109> know<00:00:58.140> how

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
supply and redstone well we all know how

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.260 
supply and redstone well we all know how
easy<00:00:58.680> it<00:00:58.770> is<00:00:58.859> to<00:00:58.920> get<00:00:59.100> redstone<00:00:59.520> however<00:01:00.059> this

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
easy it is to get redstone however this

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.310 
easy it is to get redstone however this
does<00:01:00.510> make<00:01:00.660> redstone<00:01:00.930> kinda<00:01:01.590> more<00:01:01.800> useful

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.320 
does make redstone kinda more useful

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.080 
does make redstone kinda more useful
anyways<00:01:04.320> so<00:01:04.619> basically<00:01:05.460> you<00:01:05.610> start<00:01:05.670> off<00:01:05.939> with

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:06.090 
anyways so basically you start off with

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:07.340 
anyways so basically you start off with
the<00:01:06.119> transmitter<00:01:06.630> you<00:01:06.750> set<00:01:06.930> it<00:01:07.020> to<00:01:07.110> a<00:01:07.140> specific

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
the transmitter you set it to a specific

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.679 
the transmitter you set it to a specific
frequency<00:01:07.680> and<00:01:08.280> it<00:01:08.460> kind<00:01:08.700> of<00:01:08.790> transmits<00:01:09.510> the

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
frequency and it kind of transmits the

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:12.920 
frequency and it kind of transmits the
signal<00:01:10.070> the<00:01:11.070> receiver<00:01:11.540> receives<00:01:12.540> that<00:01:12.689> said

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
signal the receiver receives that said

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.260 
signal the receiver receives that said
signal<00:01:13.320> if<00:01:13.470> it's<00:01:13.650> on<00:01:13.770> the<00:01:13.860> same<00:01:14.010> frequency<00:01:14.520> so

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
signal if it's on the same frequency so

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.480 
signal if it's on the same frequency so
let's<00:01:16.020> test<00:01:16.290> this<00:01:16.500> out<00:01:16.650> let's<00:01:16.890> set<00:01:17.070> down<00:01:17.100> a

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
let's test this out let's set down a

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.929 
let's test this out let's set down a
transmitter<00:01:18.150> and<00:01:18.439> set<00:01:19.439> down<00:01:19.560> a<00:01:19.619> lever<00:01:20.040> if<00:01:20.280> we

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
transmitter and set down a lever if we

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:22.550 
transmitter and set down a lever if we
flip<00:01:21.119> the<00:01:21.180> lever<00:01:21.390> we<00:01:22.020> can<00:01:22.140> see<00:01:22.290> that<00:01:22.409> this

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
flip the lever we can see that this

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.310 
flip the lever we can see that this
turns<00:01:22.799> on<00:01:23.270> and<00:01:24.270> if<00:01:24.450> we<00:01:24.570> look<00:01:24.689> really<00:01:25.110> closely

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
turns on and if we look really closely

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.859 
turns on and if we look really closely
we<00:01:26.189> can<00:01:26.400> see<00:01:26.640> zero<00:01:27.150> on<00:01:27.390> it<00:01:28.040> on<00:01:29.630> all<00:01:30.630> four<00:01:30.840> sides

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
we can see zero on it on all four sides

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:33.649 
we can see zero on it on all four sides
so<00:01:31.770> all<00:01:32.610> we<00:01:32.939> have<00:01:32.970> to<00:01:33.090> do<00:01:33.240> right<00:01:33.360> now<00:01:33.479> is<00:01:33.509> just

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
so all we have to do right now is just

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:36.620 
so all we have to do right now is just
click<00:01:34.140> on<00:01:34.290> well<00:01:34.890> right-click<00:01:35.479> this<00:01:36.479> will

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
click on well right-click this will

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.530 
click on well right-click this will
bring<00:01:36.810> up<00:01:37.020> the<00:01:37.520> little<00:01:38.520> UI<00:01:38.880> that<00:01:39.210> they<00:01:39.390> have

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
bring up the little UI that they have

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.499 
bring up the little UI that they have
what<00:01:40.290> I<00:01:40.320> suggest<00:01:40.770> doing<00:01:40.979> is<00:01:41.340> not<00:01:41.759> using<00:01:42.270> within

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
what I suggest doing is not using within

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.830 
what I suggest doing is not using within
the<00:01:42.630> first<00:01:42.869> two<00:01:43.380> hundred<00:01:43.829> frequencies<00:01:44.399> so<00:01:45.299> set

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
the first two hundred frequencies so set

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:47.569 
the first two hundred frequencies so set
it<00:01:45.960> to<00:01:46.049> anything<00:01:46.259> after<00:01:46.740> that<00:01:46.770> and<00:01:47.100> just<00:01:47.250> set

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
it to anything after that and just set

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:50.830 
it to anything after that and just set
whatever<00:01:47.850> you<00:01:48.270> want<00:01:48.600> let's<00:01:49.259> put<00:01:49.740> it<00:01:49.829> at<00:01:49.950> 240

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:50.840 
whatever you want let's put it at 240

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.300 
whatever you want let's put it at 240

you<00:01:53.430> need<00:01:53.579> some<00:01:53.759> reserved<00:01:54.210> spots<00:01:54.659> at<00:01:54.869> the<00:01:54.930> very

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:55.110 
you need some reserved spots at the very

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:57.260 
you need some reserved spots at the very
beginning<00:01:55.229> and<00:01:55.590> trust<00:01:55.920> me<00:01:56.009> these<00:01:56.340> do<00:01:56.909> fill<00:01:57.149> up

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
beginning and trust me these do fill up

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.420 
beginning and trust me these do fill up
rather<00:01:57.479> easily<00:01:57.930> if<00:01:58.229> you<00:01:58.409> have<00:01:58.590> a<00:01:58.619> rather<00:01:59.159> large

00:01:59.420 --> 00:01:59.430 
rather easily if you have a rather large

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:04.039 
rather easily if you have a rather large
setup<00:01:59.909> like<00:02:00.869> I<00:02:01.079> do<00:02:01.880> anyways<00:02:02.880> okay<00:02:03.210> so<00:02:03.270> just<00:02:03.930> to

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
setup like I do anyways okay so just to

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.810 
setup like I do anyways okay so just to
test<00:02:04.229> this<00:02:04.350> out<00:02:04.500> we<00:02:04.799> will<00:02:05.009> head<00:02:05.250> over<00:02:05.280> here

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
test this out we will head over here

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.559 
test this out we will head over here
plop<00:02:06.600> down<00:02:06.899> the<00:02:07.940> receiver<00:02:08.940> as<00:02:09.149> you<00:02:09.270> can<00:02:09.390> see

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
plop down the receiver as you can see

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.780 
plop down the receiver as you can see
this<00:02:09.720> is<00:02:09.929> also<00:02:10.289> frequency<00:02:10.979> set<00:02:11.280> at<00:02:11.430> zero

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:12.790 
this is also frequency set at zero

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.699 
this is also frequency set at zero
and<00:02:13.180> we're<00:02:13.750> going<00:02:13.870> to<00:02:13.900> put<00:02:14.110> a<00:02:14.140> few<00:02:14.409> lamps

00:02:14.699 --> 00:02:14.709 
and we're going to put a few lamps

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:15.990 
and we're going to put a few lamps
whoopsies<00:02:15.159> we're<00:02:15.280> going<00:02:15.400> to<00:02:15.459> put<00:02:15.549> a<00:02:15.610> few<00:02:15.790> lamps

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:16.000 
whoopsies we're going to put a few lamps

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.309 
whoopsies we're going to put a few lamps
right<00:02:16.299> across<00:02:16.540> and<00:02:18.329> as<00:02:19.329> you<00:02:19.450> can<00:02:19.569> see<00:02:19.599> if<00:02:20.079> we

00:02:20.309 --> 00:02:20.319 
right across and as you can see if we

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:22.380 
right across and as you can see if we
flip<00:02:20.650> the<00:02:20.709> switch<00:02:21.250> seeing<00:02:21.790> as<00:02:21.909> this<00:02:22.180> is

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
flip the switch seeing as this is

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.349 
flip the switch seeing as this is
frequency<00:02:22.989> 240<00:02:23.590> and<00:02:23.769> this<00:02:24.069> isn't<00:02:24.549> this

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:25.359 
frequency 240 and this isn't this

00:02:25.359 --> 00:02:28.679

doesn't turn on however i'm going to
reef<00:02:29.200> lip<00:02:29.409> the<00:02:29.530> switch<00:02:29.739> okay<00:02:30.099> so<00:02:30.159> let's<00:02:30.790> switch

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:31.180 
reef lip the switch okay so let's switch

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.759 
reef lip the switch okay so let's switch
this<00:02:31.450> to<00:02:31.689> frequency<00:02:32.470> 240<00:02:33.750> is<00:02:34.750> it<00:02:34.959> 240<00:02:35.349> yes<00:02:35.620> it

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:35.769 
this to frequency 240 is it 240 yes it

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:38.130 
this to frequency 240 is it 240 yes it
is<00:02:35.859> okay<00:02:36.790> let's<00:02:37.090> flip<00:02:37.359> the<00:02:37.480> switch<00:02:37.689> and<00:02:37.870> see

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 
is okay let's flip the switch and see

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.509 
is okay let's flip the switch and see
what<00:02:38.230> happens<00:02:38.639> this<00:02:39.639> lights<00:02:40.030> up<00:02:40.329> and<00:02:41.519> it's

00:02:42.509 --> 00:02:42.519 
what happens this lights up and it's

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:44.849 
what happens this lights up and it's
fairly<00:02:42.930> instantaneous<00:02:43.930> so<00:02:44.260> if<00:02:44.469> you<00:02:44.620> have

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:44.859 
fairly instantaneous so if you have

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:47.789 
fairly instantaneous so if you have
multiple<00:02:45.480> you<00:02:46.480> know<00:02:46.599> receivers<00:02:47.170> this<00:02:47.560> will

00:02:47.789 --> 00:02:47.799 
multiple you know receivers this will

00:02:47.799 --> 00:02:50.009 
multiple you know receivers this will
work<00:02:48.069> so<00:02:48.760> let's<00:02:48.970> set<00:02:49.120> that<00:02:49.180> one<00:02:49.480> here<00:02:49.810> let's

00:02:50.009 --> 00:02:50.019 
work so let's set that one here let's

00:02:50.019 --> 00:02:53.149 
work so let's set that one here let's
set<00:02:50.230> that<00:02:50.260> one<00:02:50.500> here<00:02:50.739> let's<00:02:50.980> set<00:02:51.189> this<00:02:51.340> one<00:02:51.519> for

00:02:53.149 --> 00:02:53.159 
set that one here let's set this one for

00:02:53.159 --> 00:03:00.149 
set that one here let's set this one for
240<00:02:55.049> whoops<00:02:57.540> 240<00:02:58.540> and<00:02:58.750> again<00:02:59.439> let's<00:02:59.709> just<00:02:59.980> set

00:03:00.149 --> 00:03:00.159 
240 whoops 240 and again let's just set

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:03.750 
240 whoops 240 and again let's just set
that<00:03:00.189> one<00:03:00.519> as<00:03:00.760> some<00:03:01.419> random<00:03:01.599> number<00:03:02.579> this<00:03:03.579> is

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
that one as some random number this is

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:05.490 
that one as some random number this is
just<00:03:03.939> a<00:03:04.000> proof<00:03:04.209> of<00:03:04.299> concept<00:03:04.510> to<00:03:05.019> show<00:03:05.200> that<00:03:05.379> it

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
just a proof of concept to show that it

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.649 
just a proof of concept to show that it
does<00:03:05.769> in<00:03:05.950> fact<00:03:05.980> work<00:03:06.790> the<00:03:07.000> way<00:03:07.150> you'd<00:03:07.299> expect

00:03:07.649 --> 00:03:07.659 
does in fact work the way you'd expect

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:09.690 
does in fact work the way you'd expect
it<00:03:07.780> to<00:03:07.900> and<00:03:08.169> you<00:03:08.769> can<00:03:08.889> have<00:03:08.980> as<00:03:09.129> many<00:03:09.370> of<00:03:09.579> these

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
it to and you can have as many of these

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.670 
it to and you can have as many of these
as<00:03:09.760> you<00:03:10.030> want<00:03:10.299> and<00:03:10.629> as<00:03:11.049> many<00:03:11.409> of<00:03:11.560> those

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:11.680 
as you want and as many of those

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:16.710 
as you want and as many of those
receivers<00:03:12.159> as<00:03:12.459> you<00:03:12.579> want<00:03:14.250> voila<00:03:15.250> and<00:03:15.609> I<00:03:16.480> mean

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
receivers as you want voila and I mean

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:22.379 
receivers as you want voila and I mean
that<00:03:16.989> is<00:03:17.229> fairly<00:03:17.530> instantaneous<00:03:21.150> there<00:03:22.150> is<00:03:22.359> a

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:22.389 
that is fairly instantaneous there is a

00:03:22.389 --> 00:03:25.140 
that is fairly instantaneous there is a
potential<00:03:23.079> tick<00:03:23.470> lag<00:03:23.709> for<00:03:24.129> actually<00:03:24.909> turning

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:25.150 
potential tick lag for actually turning

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.539 
potential tick lag for actually turning
off<00:03:25.329> the<00:03:25.709> devices<00:03:26.709> around<00:03:26.799> it<00:03:27.190> but<00:03:27.340> that's

00:03:27.539 --> 00:03:27.549 
off the devices around it but that's

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:30.509 
off the devices around it but that's
because<00:03:27.909> it's<00:03:28.180> a<00:03:28.269> tick<00:03:28.680> the<00:03:29.680> setting<00:03:30.400> on

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:30.519 
because it's a tick the setting on

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:33.439 
because it's a tick the setting on
turning<00:03:31.180> off<00:03:31.359> and<00:03:31.540> on<00:03:31.690> of<00:03:31.989> the<00:03:32.109> receivers<00:03:32.739> is

00:03:33.439 --> 00:03:33.449 
turning off and on of the receivers is

00:03:33.449 --> 00:03:39.899 
turning off and on of the receivers is
fairly<00:03:34.949> synced<00:03:35.949> up<00:03:37.889> anyways<00:03:38.889> so<00:03:39.459> that's<00:03:39.760> about

00:03:39.899 --> 00:03:39.909 
fairly synced up anyways so that's about

00:03:39.909 --> 00:03:41.399 
fairly synced up anyways so that's about
it<00:03:40.030> I<00:03:40.180> mean<00:03:40.419> this<00:03:40.569> is<00:03:40.720> a<00:03:40.750> fairly<00:03:41.139> quick

00:03:41.399 --> 00:03:41.409 
it I mean this is a fairly quick

00:03:41.409 --> 00:03:43.259 
it I mean this is a fairly quick
tutorial<00:03:41.979> I<00:03:42.129> am<00:03:42.159> well<00:03:42.489> not<00:03:42.609> really<00:03:42.760> tutorial

00:03:43.259 --> 00:03:43.269 
tutorial I am well not really tutorial

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:44.969 
tutorial I am well not really tutorial
just<00:03:43.479> kind<00:03:43.659> of<00:03:43.720> a<00:03:43.810> mod<00:03:43.989> spotlight<00:03:44.229> to<00:03:44.530> show<00:03:44.739> how

00:03:44.969 --> 00:03:44.979 
just kind of a mod spotlight to show how

00:03:44.979 --> 00:03:46.680 
just kind of a mod spotlight to show how
to<00:03:45.040> actually<00:03:45.430> use<00:03:45.519> wireless<00:03:45.940> transmitters

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:46.690 
to actually use wireless transmitters

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:48.809 
to actually use wireless transmitters
and<00:03:46.840> receivers<00:03:47.019> and<00:03:47.680> I<00:03:48.129> mean<00:03:48.310> you<00:03:48.430> can<00:03:48.519> plug

00:03:48.809 --> 00:03:48.819 
and receivers and I mean you can plug

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:50.789 
and receivers and I mean you can plug
these<00:03:48.970> in<00:03:49.150> the<00:03:49.239> wall<00:03:49.449> you<00:03:49.810> can<00:03:49.930> hide<00:03:50.290> them<00:03:50.620> type

00:03:50.789 --> 00:03:50.799 
these in the wall you can hide them type

00:03:50.799 --> 00:03:52.649 
these in the wall you can hide them type
of<00:03:50.829> thing<00:03:51.190> it's<00:03:51.519> all<00:03:51.819> there<00:03:52.090> and<00:03:52.329> not<00:03:52.479> to

00:03:52.649 --> 00:03:52.659 
of thing it's all there and not to

00:03:52.659 --> 00:03:53.939 
of thing it's all there and not to
mention<00:03:52.690> if<00:03:53.169> you<00:03:53.290> really<00:03:53.590> want<00:03:53.769> to<00:03:53.859> be

00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:53.949 
mention if you really want to be

00:03:53.949 --> 00:03:56.759 
mention if you really want to be
specific<00:03:55.109> what<00:03:56.109> you<00:03:56.229> can<00:03:56.349> do<00:03:56.470> is<00:03:56.590> actually

00:03:56.759 --> 00:03:56.769 
specific what you can do is actually

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:59.189 
specific what you can do is actually

behind<00:04:03.189> a<00:04:03.519> wall<00:04:03.760> let's<00:04:04.419> say<00:04:04.689> something<00:04:05.319> like

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:05.500 
behind a wall let's say something like

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:09.929 
behind a wall let's say something like
that<00:04:08.069> pretend<00:04:09.069> that's<00:04:09.220> a<00:04:09.310> wall<00:04:09.489> i<00:04:09.519> know<00:04:09.699> it's

00:04:09.929 --> 00:04:09.939 
that pretend that's a wall i know it's

00:04:09.939 --> 00:04:21.809 
that pretend that's a wall i know it's
fairly<00:04:10.150> low

00:04:21.809 --> 00:04:21.819 

00:04:21.819 --> 00:04:24.909 

there<00:04:22.819> we<00:04:22.970> go<00:04:23.349> sorry<00:04:24.349> about<00:04:24.470> that<00:04:24.560> i<00:04:24.680> forgot<00:04:24.770> to

00:04:24.909 --> 00:04:24.919 
there we go sorry about that i forgot to

00:04:24.919 --> 00:04:27.969 
there we go sorry about that i forgot to
high<00:04:25.130> had<00:04:25.490> to<00:04:25.610> invert<00:04:25.940> the<00:04:26.060> signal<00:04:26.419> so<00:04:27.199> this

00:04:27.969 --> 00:04:27.979 
high had to invert the signal so this

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:30.580 
high had to invert the signal so this
works<00:04:28.280> and<00:04:28.550> it's<00:04:28.970> pretty<00:04:29.539> much<00:04:29.810> inverted<00:04:30.380> to

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:30.590 
works and it's pretty much inverted to

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:34.089 
works and it's pretty much inverted to
soho<00:04:31.310> you<00:04:32.180> know<00:04:32.300> if<00:04:32.660> you<00:04:32.870> flip<00:04:33.259> a<00:04:33.289> switch<00:04:33.500> on<00:04:33.770> it

00:04:34.089 --> 00:04:34.099 
soho you know if you flip a switch on it

00:04:34.099 --> 00:04:36.719 
soho you know if you flip a switch on it
can<00:04:34.340> turn<00:04:34.520> on<00:04:34.699> lights<00:04:35.030> why<00:04:35.720> not<00:04:35.960> right<00:04:36.319> and

00:04:36.719 --> 00:04:36.729 
can turn on lights why not right and

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:39.100 
can turn on lights why not right and
that's<00:04:37.729> how<00:04:38.000> you<00:04:38.060> do<00:04:38.330> it<00:04:38.479> and<00:04:38.630> it<00:04:38.690> works<00:04:38.930> out

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.110 
that's how you do it and it works out

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:43.659 
that's how you do it and it works out
rather<00:04:39.410> well<00:04:41.560> keep<00:04:42.560> in<00:04:42.680> mind<00:04:42.710> i<00:04:43.009> don't<00:04:43.430> believe

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:43.669 
rather well keep in mind i don't believe

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:45.370 
rather well keep in mind i don't believe
there's<00:04:43.880> much<00:04:44.030> the<00:04:44.270> distance<00:04:44.780> on<00:04:44.960> this<00:04:45.139> let's

00:04:45.370 --> 00:04:45.380 
there's much the distance on this let's

00:04:45.380 --> 00:04:48.040 
there's much the distance on this let's
test<00:04:45.740> it<00:04:45.889> out<00:04:46.069> let's<00:04:46.910> go<00:04:47.150> somewhere<00:04:47.509> further

00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:48.050 
test it out let's go somewhere further

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:57.100 
test it out let's go somewhere further
down<00:04:50.889> nope<00:04:51.970> so<00:04:52.970> it's<00:04:53.810> pretty<00:04:54.139> far<00:04:54.440> away<00:04:56.110> i'm
