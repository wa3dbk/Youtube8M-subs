00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
bucks at that website so i kind of like

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.800

figured it was probably worth the
investment<00:01:13.770> but<00:01:14.340> then<00:01:14.760> I<00:01:15.060> found<00:01:15.330> it<00:01:15.570> at

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:15.890 
investment but then I found it at
