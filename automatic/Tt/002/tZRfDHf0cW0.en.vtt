00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:23.210
 Hello dear friends with you vampire 

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:26.330
 1735 and yesterday April 3 in the evening to us 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:29.090
 added on the tank on the x-box and the new mod 

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:31.699
 so to speak tanks on the moon as we see 

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:33.620
 here we all play fights only on 9 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:35.239
 levels that is lunar and play with the moon 

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.110
 frame we can not play with any other 

00:00:35.239 --> 00:00:38.809
 by tanks 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:41.510
 afraid of 7 to 7 respectively collect 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:43.820
 platoon of five and go all bend over so 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:46.160
 we see the external card is completely 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:49.489
 sandy river just slightly added 

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:51.289
 new texture to so completely drunk and 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:53.719
 the river here we see before us even 

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:56.170
 the planet earth is drawn that is it we 

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:59.750
 I play all the time boom now in the moon 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:01.609
 we are so very well exposed here 

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:02.710
 gravity that is traced like on 

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:05.630
 real moon 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:10.220
 we shoot here lasers average damage 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:12.530
 with a shot of 30-40 hp we have 560 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.270
 580 I do not remember how many great and 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.820
 respectively with the drum and its 

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:20.270
 pick up the discharge of the drum from us 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:23.810
 is 3 seconds with a drum y and 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:26.479
 we take out the tank one more plus our guns 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:29.030
 this is something that there is no information what is it 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:30.710
 that is, that is, no matter how we play 

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.689
 there will always be one thing here 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:35.390
 the same if we stand and shoot 

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:37.040
 if we go and shoot with us 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:39.820
 information is always the same 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.540
 pineapple with an average of about apt-2 and 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.009
 accordingly, once we need 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.409
 stop always shoot at 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:46.310
 movement then we will be fine 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:48.950
 turn out 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:51.710
 I also want to note that on this tank 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:54.020
 it's hard to shoot exactly the same with 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.939
 prejudice that is it is better around it 

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:58.759
 he ride and then accordingly you 

00:01:55.939 --> 00:02:00.140
 he will get everything for you 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:03.020
 I want to show you a fight 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.950
 gravity than tanks on x 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:07.159
 boxing from bye 

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:10.099
 what to expect next and as far as 

00:02:07.159 --> 00:02:10.550
 cool here i'm gonna drive with my 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:13.550
 clan 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:15.560
 more precisely, I go with my own with a platoon 

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.480
 this is my clan member 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.550
 Now we will show you in principle what 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:22.700
 it is lunar and how it is played 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:25.730
 in general, what are they for and all 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:28.580
 the rest and so see what we see 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:30.500
 the first is that when we shoot 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.450
 half of us breaks down no 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:35.120
 because getting into a mask can 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:37.400
 get somewhere bevel tower and also 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:40.040
 somewhere else there let loose 

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:42.319
 it will also ricochet that here in the tank 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.269
 I personally like something that is not for repair 

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:46.310
 no need to pay for shells 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:47.989
 that is, we pay exclusively here 

00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:50.810
 Is it just a bazaar in the kit and 

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:52.640
 or for fire extinguishers plaster first aid kit 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:54.440
 that you put this here with us big 

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:57.230
 plus that is, you only need to pay for 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:03:01.010
 consumable items for projectile repair not 

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:03.830
 pay one more such well not minus tank 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:06.200
 but it's just not a good thing. 

00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:09.200
 this is something that it is impossible to earn 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:11.720
 experience neither silver nor the end 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.640
 battlefield you will see that this tank is no 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:17.299
 yield does not bring us we play for 

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:19.670
 on it just for fun and all that is 0 

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:22.430
 experience 0 silver and everything comes first 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:25.340
 will always be that I say again 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:27.650
 this tank is good 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.299
 see another 24 same moon so here I am 

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:31.640
 spin around him accordingly he doesn't 

00:03:29.299 --> 00:03:34.010
 can you not get here when he went 

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:36.140
 in motion I also sometimes fall for yes 

00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:38.660
 no yes today I 'm spinning around him 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:41.569
 I shoot at them their soundness gun 

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:43.970
 top past shooting we are here with lasers 

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:45.829
 they are with outfits and when we shoot you 

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:48.170
 can hear quite cool 

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:50.750
 sound tanks need to allocate here in 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:54.709
 basically just a caravan for us 

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:56.720
 did not leave temporarily mixing Pushkin not 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:03:59.530
 Pushkin's information aiming tank 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:02.660
 eat just push the fish we are all brought together 

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:04.609
 in this fight I shot a lot 

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:06.200
 in principle, you will see 

00:04:04.609 --> 00:04:08.780
 you can paint on this tank you 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:11.660
 Now I will try to show you 

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:14.840
 more or less here we are all well 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:17.269
 made the mod will go we have only three 

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:17.959
