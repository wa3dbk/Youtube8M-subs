00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:03.439 
it's got momentum back so if we can just

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:05.499 
it's got momentum back so if we can just
keep<00:02:03.590> going<00:02:03.950> with<00:02:04.070> it<00:02:04.159> and<00:02:04.369> booster<00:02:05.210> come<00:02:05.420> to

us a little more God you guys improved

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:09.669 
us a little more God you guys improved
as<00:02:08.090> the<00:02:08.179> game<00:02:08.360> went<00:02:08.539> on<00:02:08.660> how<00:02:08.899> to<00:02:08.959> encouraging

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 
as the game went on how to encouraging

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:11.770 
as the game went on how to encouraging
signs<00:02:10.069> that<00:02:10.369> it<00:02:10.640> was<00:02:11.000> good<00:02:11.180> it<00:02:11.209> was<00:02:11.510> actually

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:11.780 
signs that it was good it was actually

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:13.360 
signs that it was good it was actually
similar<00:02:11.959> to<00:02:12.200> our<00:02:12.319> game<00:02:12.530> against<00:02:13.100> northeastern

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
similar to our game against northeastern

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.970 
similar to our game against northeastern
the<00:02:13.700> second<00:02:14.030> night<00:02:14.150> we<00:02:14.530> did<00:02:15.530> okay<00:02:15.830> in<00:02:15.860> the

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
the second night we did okay in the

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.640 
the second night we did okay in the
first<00:02:16.280> I<00:02:16.549> mean<00:02:16.700> not<00:02:16.790> our<00:02:16.970> best<00:02:17.090> period<00:02:17.390> but<00:02:17.750> and

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:18.650 
first I mean not our best period but and

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:19.660 
first I mean not our best period but and
then<00:02:18.739> we<00:02:18.830> did<00:02:18.920> a<00:02:19.010> little<00:02:19.160> bit<00:02:19.280> better<00:02:19.459> in<00:02:19.610> a

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:19.670 
then we did a little bit better in a

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:22.449 
then we did a little bit better in a
second<00:02:20.120> despite<00:02:20.569> the<00:02:20.780> goal<00:02:21.260> against<00:02:21.680> and<00:02:21.980> I

00:02:22.449 --> 00:02:22.459 
second despite the goal against and I

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:23.890 
second despite the goal against and I
thought<00:02:22.819> we<00:02:22.940> played<00:02:23.120> even<00:02:23.420> better<00:02:23.690> in<00:02:23.810> the

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:23.900 
thought we played even better in the

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:26.020 
thought we played even better in the
third<00:02:24.140> so<00:02:24.799> that's<00:02:25.220> it<00:02:25.340> that's<00:02:25.549> a<00:02:25.670> good<00:02:25.819> sign

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:26.030 
third so that's it that's a good sign

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.080 
third so that's it that's a good sign
but<00:02:26.239> again<00:02:26.450> it's<00:02:26.599> just<00:02:26.690> one<00:02:26.930> game<00:02:27.110> with<00:02:27.380> help

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.090 
but again it's just one game with help

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:35.480 
but again it's just one game with help
tomorrow's<00:02:29.090> games<00:02:29.239> worth<00:02:29.420> two<00:02:29.599> points<00:02:29.750> do<00:02:30.049> so

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:38.300
