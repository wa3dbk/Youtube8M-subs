00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:05.160
 what is hello dear friends swami 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:07.589
 befana and before you start a conversation 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:09.929
 with my video I would like to pre 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:10.410
 apologize to you for giving 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:13.500
 me 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:15.630
 desktop entourage since long ago 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.880
 I did not move and plan games that 

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.730
 now you can eat there 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.039
 delete so now the conversation will go 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.650
 about minecraft but more precisely in the update in 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.140
 the last video, I told her to beat 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.029
 on version 1 62 

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:32.099
 since many could not go with 15 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.440
 Go there was a comfortable launcher still quite 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:37.350
 comfortable and so I showed you 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:39.960
 pirate launcher so here are the cakes Lance and 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.899
 the voucher was also updated along with 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:45.180
 so that the official is not updated 

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:46.260
 because I noticed your questions in 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.050
 commentary supposedly 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.960
 things if you upgrade to 164 whether they 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.780
 life is in this something is possible yes she is 972 we 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.989
 can't find this parameter so here i am 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.539
 I decided to check whether it's possible that the same 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:04.229
 downloading my own file I installed it 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:06.810
 opened tried to download maincraft by 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.390
 new and found that yes indeed u 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:15.689
 I was missing point 1 strong well 

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:19.500
 172 is also 1742 back so here but 

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:23.700
 the fact that I discovered the installation is not something I 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:25.830
 discovered the issue of downloading a new file 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.619
 that is, a new launcher that will allow 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:30.630
 upgrade to 172 this file called 

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:33.869
 minecraft not oppressed now 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:36.450
 located in the zone of the cursor 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:38.400
 I'll open it now and 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.340
 no let's come before I open it 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:45.720
 I will check antivirus to see no threats 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:47.970
 discovered remove download it again 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:51.200
 so you have no doubt about 

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:54.979
 that file may be viral 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:59.219
 throwing on the property minecraft 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:02:01.200
 tass cannibal anti-virus threats not 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:02.070
 discovered so after all these 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.950
 operations 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:07.060
 I want to open it and after opening 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:10.010
 I will start downloading 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:12.340
 files downloading takes some 

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:14.960
 time therefore you excuse me if 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:18.710
 paused and after a pause I will return 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:21.020
 and calmly scatter that yes how am I 

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:23.480
 come back and now we have 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:25.460
 the file was up to download 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:29.470
 1st century like last video for sure 

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:34.340
 We are seen and the status we have to install and 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:36.920
 let's download and I will show you what 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:40.280
 really 12 minekravt works 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:44.980
 no lags no interruptions like 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:47.360
 should you actually saying so 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.340
 we are pumping ready to play 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:53.630
 that is, now we can quite run 

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:57.680
 memory is allocated 1100 megabytes this 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:59.690
 ok for minecraft now means 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:02.030
 that we have already opened it since it 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:04.130
 he died this machine in this shop 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:06.650
 not knowing why you're not quite comfortable but 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:10.190
 glance so launcher basically you can 

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:13.270
 close and now i'll show you what's in 

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:17.600
 work powerlessly let's go on a server 

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:22.150

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:31.570
 pirate everything is ready create a new world 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:34.570

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:34.570
 So 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:44.959
 as you can see everything was created everything works 

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:52.049
 the key because chunks are not loaded 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:55.829

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:58.530
