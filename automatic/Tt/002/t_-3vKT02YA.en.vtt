hidden hangar in Harrisburg Pennsylvania
and<00:00:12.840> today<00:00:13.260> we're<00:00:13.469> going<00:00:13.680> to<00:00:13.770> discuss<00:00:14.219> radios

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:17.240 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.109 

let's<00:00:18.240> start<00:00:18.539> off<00:00:18.690> with<00:00:18.900> the<00:00:19.050> basic<00:00:19.880> radios<00:00:20.880> we

00:00:21.109 --> 00:00:21.119 
let's start off with the basic radios we

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:28.190 
let's start off with the basic radios we
have<00:00:21.330> today<00:00:21.690> today<00:00:22.560> we<00:00:22.830> have<00:00:22.859> a<00:00:24.350> Futaba<00:00:26.390> 4<00:00:27.390> YF

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:28.200 
have today today we have a Futaba 4 YF

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.520 
have today today we have a Futaba 4 YF
transmitter<00:00:28.920> it's<00:00:29.700> a<00:00:29.910> basic

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:30.530 
transmitter it's a basic

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
non-programmable 4 channel radio and

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.139 
non-programmable 4 channel radio and
from<00:00:34.230> there<00:00:34.500> we<00:00:34.920> take<00:00:35.129> a<00:00:35.190> step<00:00:35.520> up<00:00:35.730> to<00:00:36.000> the

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
from there we take a step up to the

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:38.299 
from there we take a step up to the
