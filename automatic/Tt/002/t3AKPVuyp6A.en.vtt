00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
 hi friends my name is mark and today 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:06.330
 passed another mother shooting I want 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.690
 share with you the experience that I 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.690
 has gained 

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:34.250
 at least start with the background light in 

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:39.140
 as a flash used canon 580ex 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:40.880
 2 with settings 1 2 and the main purpose of this 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:43.940
 flashes it separate 

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:46.580
 the model, that is, the object from the background, and 

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.200
 accordingly highlight from phone in 

00:00:46.580 --> 00:00:50.300
 this plan helped me a lot 

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:53.060
 card is white which is included in this 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:56.140
 the flash is originally that is this card 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:58.900
 us fulfills the dual purpose of persian 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:03.190
 redirects the light side of the background and 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:03.190
 blocks it from the model 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:19.000
 as for the main light i 

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:24.250
 used three sources one of them 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:26.740
 it's us 430 x 2 with settings 1 4 and 70 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:29.170
 millimeters meaning it is more such 

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.630
 hard more directional light in 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:34.810
 side of the model than let's say this 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:37.619
 flash which is also less than 430 x 

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:41.439
 2 but already with a gary fong diffuser on this 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:43.960
 defender helps this flash 

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:47.229
 spread light evenly across 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:49.990
 the remainder of the face as 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:53.649
 third light source it was 

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:55.959
 built-in flash in canon 650d camera 

00:01:53.649 --> 00:01:57.640
 which just ran all the rest 

00:01:55.959 --> 00:01:59.789
 flashes i.e. background its main 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.789
 sources of 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:07.739
 colleagues keys listen to this illusion 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:29.030
 Thanks for watching this video and remember 

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:32.650
 that practice will always add to your experience 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.650
 so shoot more often 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.420
 strings
