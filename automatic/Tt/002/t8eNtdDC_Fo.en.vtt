hardware no I can't build a deck still
kind<00:00:12.840> of<00:00:12.900> have<00:00:13.049> to<00:00:13.080> review<00:00:13.530> all<00:00:13.590> these<00:00:13.860> things

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:14.630 
kind of have to review all these things

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:18.290 
kind of have to review all these things
first<00:00:15.630> thing<00:00:16.020> is<00:00:16.980> you<00:00:17.190> Jared<00:00:17.609> it's<00:00:17.820> exit

boys your flex doors so yeah basically
the<00:00:27.330> main<00:00:28.019> focal<00:00:28.439> point<00:00:28.680> of<00:00:28.920> this<00:00:29.220> bill<00:00:29.519> is<00:00:29.849> to

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
the main focal point of this bill is to

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.260 
the main focal point of this bill is to
be<00:00:30.330> like<00:00:30.539> really<00:00:30.779> fast<00:00:31.260> so<00:00:31.980> I<00:00:32.279> got<00:00:32.489> six<00:00:32.910> they

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
be like really fast so I got six they

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.950 
be like really fast so I got six they
for<00:00:33.600> the<00:00:33.780> Evo's<00:00:34.850> 120<00:00:35.850> gigabytes<00:00:36.090> because

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
for the Evo's 120 gigabytes because

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.650 
for the Evo's 120 gigabytes because
they're<00:00:37.170> like<00:00:37.440> really<00:00:37.950> fast<00:00:38.399> and<00:00:38.940> decently

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
they're like really fast and decently

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.170 
they're like really fast and decently
cheap<00:00:39.750> and<00:00:40.350> the<00:00:40.649> chips<00:00:40.920> that<00:00:41.160> can<00:00:41.219> do<00:00:41.520> six<00:00:41.879> out

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
cheap and the chips that can do six out

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.990 
cheap and the chips that can do six out
of<00:00:42.210> six<00:00:42.530> so<00:00:43.530> I'm<00:00:43.620> hoping<00:00:43.920> for<00:00:44.160> fat<00:00:44.430> raid<00:00:44.670> 0

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
of six so I'm hoping for fat raid 0

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.410 
of six so I'm hoping for fat raid 0
array<00:00:45.030> with<00:00:45.360> these<00:00:45.570> I<00:00:46.700> was<00:00:47.700> planning<00:00:47.850> on<00:00:48.090> doing

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:48.420 
array with these I was planning on doing

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.240 
array with these I was planning on doing
a<00:00:48.510> build<00:00:48.719> like<00:00:48.899> this<00:00:48.960> back<00:00:49.469> in<00:00:49.500> IV<00:00:50.039> but<00:00:50.190> I

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
a build like this back in IV but I

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.040 
a build like this back in IV but I
didn't<00:00:50.489> have<00:00:50.610> any<00:00:50.789> money<00:00:51.059> didn't<00:00:51.600> have<00:00:51.690> a<00:00:51.719> job

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
didn't have any money didn't have a job

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.590 
didn't have any money didn't have a job
and<00:00:52.500> then<00:00:52.710> has<00:00:53.010> all<00:00:53.219> came<00:00:53.430> out<00:00:53.610> and<00:00:53.940> it's

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
and then has all came out and it's

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.889 
and then has all came out and it's
faster<00:00:55.199> and<00:00:55.559> it's<00:00:55.649> got<00:00:56.579> a<00:00:56.610> better<00:00:56.820> chipset<00:00:57.480> so

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
faster and it's got a better chipset so

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.400 
faster and it's got a better chipset so
I'm<00:00:58.050> doing<00:00:58.469> it<00:00:59.030> the<00:01:00.030> graphics<00:01:00.390> card<00:01:00.660> is<00:01:01.079> the

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
I'm doing it the graphics card is the

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:08.060 
I'm doing it the graphics card is the

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:39.810 
didn't want something slow either so

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.190 
didn't want something slow either so
2400<00:01:40.500> is<00:01:40.740> I<00:01:42.049> guess<00:01:43.049> the<00:01:43.320> entry<00:01:43.890> level<00:01:43.920> 4

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 
2400 is I guess the entry level 4

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.840 
2400 is I guess the entry level 4
