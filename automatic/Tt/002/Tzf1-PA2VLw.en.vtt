00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:55.980 

we're<00:03:54.820> going<00:03:54.940> to<00:03:55.000> use<00:03:55.090> our<00:03:55.210> three<00:03:55.510> sixteenths

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:55.990 
we're going to use our three sixteenths

00:03:55.990 --> 00:04:12.260 
we're going to use our three sixteenths
nut<00:03:56.050> driver<00:03:56.380> put<00:03:56.980> all<00:03:57.070> these<00:03:57.160> screws<00:03:57.430> back<00:03:57.580> in

another<00:04:13.270> way<00:04:13.420> of<00:04:13.510> the<00:04:13.600> screws<00:04:13.870> all<00:04:14.050> in<00:04:14.230> we<00:04:14.770> can

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:15.100 
another way of the screws all in we can

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:17.340 
another way of the screws all in we can
reconnect<00:04:15.580> the<00:04:15.850> solenoid<00:04:16.810> to<00:04:17.080> the<00:04:17.170> wiring

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:17.350 
reconnect the solenoid to the wiring

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:19.860 
reconnect the solenoid to the wiring
harness<00:04:17.850> all<00:04:18.850> you<00:04:18.970> have<00:04:19.090> to<00:04:19.150> do<00:04:19.270> is<00:04:19.390> plug<00:04:19.630> it<00:04:19.750> in

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:19.870 
harness all you have to do is plug it in

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:24.900 
harness all you have to do is plug it in
so<00:04:20.050> it<00:04:20.140> locks<00:04:20.260> in<00:04:20.470> place<00:04:23.580> once<00:04:24.580> you<00:04:24.670> have<00:04:24.790> the
