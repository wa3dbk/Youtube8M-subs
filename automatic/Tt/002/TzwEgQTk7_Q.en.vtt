00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.470
 was hi to all guys i do this 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:06.210
 short video so because a friend of mine 

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:10.139
 tonight we go to another message on 

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:14.940
 facebook and letting me see let's say 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:16.619
 this news to san marino comics and i am 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.869
 went to take a look 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.480
 I have seen so many people who are not 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.560
 agree on this thing 

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:24.359
 so first of all I want to say that 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.310
 often we always complain that 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.380
 These fairs are all the same all 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:30.480
 standard there is never something 

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:33.059
 really new 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.649
 because in the end and so the fairs 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:38.989
 italy sex improves all a bit 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:42.120
 I don't think so but I think that 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:44.610
 there are really many during the fair 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.620
 moments in which to give something 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.420
 new to the public on stage there are 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:51.239
 many dead moments to fill with 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:54.420
 something new was not so before a 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:56.399
 the race leaves enough sense 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.680
 cosplay is a moment and fabio da 

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:02.000
 cosplayer and also as a spectator 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:04.710
 regards others to participate sometimes 

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.720
 a bit special for building a 

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:08.520
 moment of total respect and respect 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.650
 cospia towards the public of the public 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:15.240
 to cosplayer that shouldn't be mine 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:17.540
 judgment be ruined by quotation marks 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.540
 since July 

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:23.170
 this video is absolutely not because 

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:27.040
 there is from jury level to harden 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:29.110
 sorry to make this jungle band 

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.790
 given the past, etc. has nothing to do with it 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:32.470
 really nothing if these comments 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:35.350
 my mother and father should do 

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:37.000
 say the same anyway in my opinion for 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.040
 organization is not a good idea 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.290
 and then we are there there will be another youtube 

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:45.490
 that I don't know and take advantage of 

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:47.590
 of the occasion to greet him and I repeat 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.610
 at the time of starting place there is a bit 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.130
 particular 

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:54.850
 so I went to read everyone 

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:59.320
 these comments on the san's page 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:02:01.300
 marine comics and I've seen so many people not 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.880
 agree but fortunately also a 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:07.180
 comment that the organization was saying 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:09.970
 that nobody forces cosplayers to be 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:11.800
 we say subjected to these comments that 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.940
 I'm sure as I read and I was 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.040
 I ask what I read will be 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.680
 totally ironic and polite about this 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:20.489
 I think there are no doubts and I hope that 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:23.080
 really that is so insert because the 

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:26.890
 18 consent will be given only g that 

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:29.620
 however, a signature on a piece of paper but me 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:30.940
 I always address the organization of the saint 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.070
 marine 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:36.130
 how many memberships do you really expect 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:37.870
 but to have such a thing 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:40.060
 I applaud you for having had 

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.100
 some the new that has had no one 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.110
 but on the other side I will give you one 

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:45.400
 critical because always spoken by faust 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:47.530
 rai according to me this thing I 

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.090
 will see very well and I believe that reserves 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.790
 level that the other guy won't have a 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:54.220
 face what actions to comment on people 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:56.370
 then maybe the sheet maybe wrong 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.540
 therefore I leave the benefit of the doubt e 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:02.500
 we will talk better when this thing 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:06.250
 separate including then true membership 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:09.070
 only through a signature I think though 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:12.160
 for the best doing the estimate on 100 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:16.000
 exhibitions as many as they can give you 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:20.049
 consent five people 10 15 

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:22.209
 I don't know there are people that also for 

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:23.769
 a week or even wine for me 

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:25.510
 in my case, but I know people who do 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:27.910
 prepare that allows a skit on 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:30.910
 stage you really think they might have 

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:32.890
 then the pleasure of having a disorder 

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:34.780
 during their interpretation during 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:37.239
 their performance 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:39.010
 another audio besides their audio 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:41.829
 of their skit that I think of 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:43.720
 I still believe the meaning of this 

00:03:41.829 --> 00:03:46.060
 video is therefore to say on my part 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.919
 considering that in this time frame it is 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:49.450
 passed that my friend told me 

00:03:47.919 --> 00:03:50.950
 this thing now doing this 

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:55.299
 video people have already asked me to 

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:57.070
 express an opinion on this thing 

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:58.540
 and here it is totally still the 

00:03:57.070 --> 00:04:01.120
 warm and calm because there is nothing 

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:05.470
 which to get angry in my opinion is not 

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:08.430
 will be successful and you have had one 

00:04:05.470 --> 00:04:10.930
 good idea to do something new but 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:13.209
 just the post rino race we say that 

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:16.510
 I'm sure so many cosplayers don't 

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:19.030
 will take your choice well vi 

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:21.459
 I would recommend for future editions of 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:24.760
 continue to have good ideas of 

00:04:21.459 --> 00:04:25.830
 to provide something new but not to 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:28.540
 this kind 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:31.180
 my comment here I said this 

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:33.570
 I greet you I wish you a good weekend 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:38.530
 tomorrow I will finally be a finalborgo 

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:40.210
 I will present an event here at my home 

00:04:38.530 --> 00:04:43.060
 we managed to bring Ligurian cosplay 

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:45.850
 makes me an exaggerated pleasure I hope the 

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:48.880
 what will go well there will be a post of gods 

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:50.290
 which is a preamble to the fair ring 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:52.870
 that there will be two next year 

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:56.470
 days which will be called burton hicks 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:59.770
 comics and games and I must say that it is 

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:00.220
 catching on and the location then is the 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:03.700
 top 

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:06.630
 nothing so we feel hi bye a 

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:06.630
