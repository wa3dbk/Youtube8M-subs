00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.580 
actually completely different because
this<00:01:48.299> is<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:48.450> first<00:01:48.630> time<00:01:48.930> back<00:01:49.170> you<00:01:49.229> got<00:01:49.439> in<00:01:49.530> a

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
this is the first time back you got in a

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.389 
this is the first time back you got in a
custom<00:01:49.950> mass<00:01:50.130> custom<00:01:50.610> fit<00:01:50.820> to<00:01:50.909> my<00:01:51.030> face<00:01:51.299> i<00:01:52.399> sat

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
custom mass custom fit to my face i sat

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.160 
custom mass custom fit to my face i sat
down<00:01:53.579> with<00:01:53.790> the<00:01:53.909> master<00:01:54.270> designer<00:01:54.600> and<00:01:54.960> I<00:01:54.990> had

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
down with the master designer and I had

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.770 
down with the master designer and I had
a<00:01:55.409> couple<00:01:55.740> things<00:01:56.040> really<00:01:56.939> different<00:01:57.450> I<00:01:57.600> had

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
a couple things really different I had

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.130 
a couple things really different I had
the<00:01:58.020> chin<00:01:58.380> lowered<00:01:58.950> an<00:01:59.159> extra<00:01:59.490> inch<00:01:59.670> I<00:02:00.030> had<00:02:00.750> the

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
the chin lowered an extra inch I had the

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:03.469 
the chin lowered an extra inch I had the
mask<00:02:01.409> lowered<00:02:01.920> an<00:02:02.009> extra<00:02:02.340> inch<00:02:02.520> I<00:02:02.850> had<00:02:03.119> besides

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
mask lowered an extra inch I had besides

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:06.490 
mask lowered an extra inch I had besides
flared<00:02:03.990> out<00:02:04.170> and<00:02:04.619> then<00:02:05.340> I<00:02:05.430> had<00:02:05.640> the

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
flared out and then I had the

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.859 
flared out and then I had the
peripherals<00:02:07.070> cut<00:02:07.340> back<00:02:07.550> a<00:02:07.580> little<00:02:07.850> more<00:02:08.090> so

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
peripherals cut back a little more so

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:10.510 
peripherals cut back a little more so
I've<00:02:08.990> really<00:02:09.170> done<00:02:09.560> a<00:02:09.619> lot<00:02:09.710> of<00:02:09.890> design<00:02:10.250> into

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:10.520 
I've really done a lot of design into

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.970 
I've really done a lot of design into
this<00:02:10.640> mask<00:02:10.910> every<00:02:11.690> team<00:02:11.930> has<00:02:12.170> the<00:02:12.740> same

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:12.980 
this mask every team has the same

00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:14.410 
this mask every team has the same
jerseys<00:02:13.460> all<00:02:13.730> the<00:02:14.000> players<00:02:14.210> are<00:02:14.300> the<00:02:14.330> same

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:14.420 
jerseys all the players are the same

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:16.740 
jerseys all the players are the same
jerseys<00:02:14.960> same<00:02:15.230> mass<00:02:15.500> or<00:02:16.010> saint<00:02:16.250> helmets

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
jerseys same mass or saint helmets

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:19.720 
jerseys same mass or saint helmets
sticks<00:02:17.750> very<00:02:17.870> skates<00:02:18.710> vary<00:02:19.010> a<00:02:19.070> little<00:02:19.220> bit<00:02:19.340> but

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
sticks very skates vary a little bit but

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.199 
sticks very skates vary a little bit but
oh<00:02:20.030> no<00:02:20.450> that's<00:02:20.660> still<00:02:20.990> very<00:02:21.440> similar<00:02:22.150> when<00:02:23.150> you

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
oh no that's still very similar when you

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:25.810 
oh no that's still very similar when you
see<00:02:23.360> a<00:02:23.390> goal<00:02:23.660> you<00:02:23.959> see<00:02:24.170> part<00:02:24.800> of<00:02:24.890> him<00:02:25.130> on<00:02:25.400> it<00:02:25.550> on

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:25.820 
see a goal you see part of him on it on

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:27.760 
see a goal you see part of him on it on
his<00:02:26.240> mask<00:02:26.540> I<00:02:26.780> think<00:02:26.959> that's<00:02:27.110> a<00:02:27.200> huge<00:02:27.440> reason

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:27.770 
his mask I think that's a huge reason

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:30.580 
his mask I think that's a huge reason
the<00:02:28.250> contrast<00:02:28.790> is<00:02:29.000> huge<00:02:29.330> between<00:02:29.930> everything

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:30.590 
the contrast is huge between everything

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:32.680 
the contrast is huge between everything
that's<00:02:30.890> going<00:02:31.160> on<00:02:31.280> you<00:02:31.459> can<00:02:31.700> really<00:02:32.150> notice<00:02:32.480> a

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
that's going on you can really notice a

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:34.480 
that's going on you can really notice a
mask<00:02:32.930> and<00:02:33.260> the<00:02:33.380> colors<00:02:33.920> that<00:02:33.980> they<00:02:34.190> put<00:02:34.370> out

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:34.490 
mask and the colors that they put out

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:37.510 
mask and the colors that they put out
and<00:02:34.700> the<00:02:34.790> designs<00:02:35.180> they<00:02:35.360> put<00:02:35.540> on<00:02:35.660> it<00:02:36.520> other

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:37.520 
and the designs they put on it other

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:38.740 
and the designs they put on it other
than<00:02:37.700> that<00:02:37.850> I<00:02:37.880> really<00:02:38.240> think<00:02:38.420> it's<00:02:38.510> because

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:38.750 
than that I really think it's because

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.010 
than that I really think it's because
it's<00:02:38.900> very<00:02:38.959> personal<00:02:39.380> to<00:02:39.680> goalie
