00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:10.710
 we introduce the gelatin sheets in 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.710
 cold water 

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:21.520
 in a saucepan we incorporate amaretto water 

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.520
 soluble coffee and sugar 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.090
 ah 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:30.449
 We stir and bring to boil of 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:34.189
 this way evaporates the alcohol and the 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.189
 children can also eat the cake 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.150
 when it breaks to boil, drain the 

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:48.620
 gelatin sheets and we incorporate them 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:50.690
 stir and let boil for a 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.810
 minute or until the gelatin is 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:56.010
 totally dissolved 

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:56.010
 and so much 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.420
 we let warm and prepare more coffee 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.930
 to subsequently bathe 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:02.930
 picky 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:08.430
 we add sugar to the coffee and we throw it in 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:08.430
 a vaporizer 

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.090
 ah 

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:23.070
 we crushed the cookies 

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:36.270
 we add the ointment butter and 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:36.270
 we mix well 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.640
 we put it in a removable mold where 

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:47.130
 we will have put some plant paper in the 

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:49.020
 background and we cover 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.159
 we make with the help of a spoon and 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.159
 we booked in the fridge 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.920
 we toss the mascarpone cheese in the 

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:02.840
 blender you can use any cheese 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:06.010
 cream type but remember that the tiramisu 

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.010
 is done with mascarpone 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.680
 we beat a little with the flat beater and 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.910
 we are incorporating the mixture little by little 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:18.860
 of coffee containing gelatin 

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.860
 dissolved and that we had reserved 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:33.340
 once all the 

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.340
 ingredients we reserve in a bowl 

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:39.690
 let's assemble the cream remember that you should 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:42.400
 to be cold add the sugar and 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:44.300
 we beat with the balloon type rod 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.490
 the mind 

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:49.870
 it is not necessary to mount the cream of the whole 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:49.870
 we will leave it assembled 

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:56.880
 and so much 

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:58.140
 and now we are incorporating little to 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.860
 little to the cheese mixture with 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:00.860
 enveloping movements 

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:23.390
 let's fill the mold with the mixture 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.390
 up to half of approximately 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.780
 we enlist well with the help of a 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:31.780
 spoon 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:36.900
 and now let's put these biscuits of 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.340
 soletilla or picks all over the 

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:41.590
 surface 

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:44.200
 we lightly sprinkle the part of coffee 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:45.849
 down and put all the cake there 

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.530
 who dips the cupcakes in the coffee 

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:49.330
 but I do not like them because then the 

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:53.700
 cake crumbles and is very watery 

00:03:49.330 --> 00:03:53.700
 so as you like more 

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:02.470
 The idea is to cover the entire surface so 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:05.340
 that we will cut out the biscuits for 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:05.340
 cover all the gaps 

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:11.640
 now we sprinkle the biscuits with coffee 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:15.050
 will take all the flavor of coffee and 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:15.050
 sponge cake will remain whole 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:20.000
 we cover with the rest of the mixture and 

00:04:17.489 --> 00:04:20.000
 alice masters 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:28.120
 so that you stay perfect you can 

00:04:26.289 --> 00:04:31.919
 use a spatula like this or 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.919
 even a long flat knife 

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:38.599
 a photo to upload the instagram and 

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:38.599
 the refrigerator for a minimum of 6 hours 

00:04:41.009 --> 00:04:45.629
 Now let's unmold it and decorate it 

00:04:43.249 --> 00:04:47.430
 how I forgot to put acetate 

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:49.789
 first I pass a knife around the 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:49.789
 cake 

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:53.640
 with a carton of a box of cookies I 

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:56.250
 made some circles that we will use 

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:58.200
 to decorate we place them 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:02.390
 randomly by the surface of the 

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:02.390
 cake and sprinkle cocoa powder 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:14.580
 and now we remove the circles with a pulse 

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:17.330
 of the same cheesecake surgeon 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:17.330
 I remember you remember 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:26.000
 we put some coffee beans inside 

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:28.770
 the circles that will be decorative only 

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:31.460
 Kenyan coffee by the way authentic 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:31.460
 brought from there 

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:37.630
 we open the mold and very carefully 

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:37.630
 we unmold 

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:45.370
 we place and here you have this wonder 

00:05:43.569 --> 00:05:47.169
 of cut you see that perfect is the 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:51.150
 sponge cake moistened inside 

00:05:47.169 --> 00:05:51.150
 coffee but whole to taste it
