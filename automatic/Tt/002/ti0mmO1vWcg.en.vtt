efficiently than other solutions so

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.650 
efficiently than other solutions so
inside<00:00:44.469> the<00:00:44.620> box<00:00:44.829> you<00:00:45.040> find<00:00:45.309> an<00:00:45.550> AC<00:00:45.820> power<00:00:46.270> cord

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:49.660 
and the USB charging hub itself so it's

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:53.460 
and the USB charging hub itself so it's
got<00:00:49.870> a<00:00:50.080> 2.1<00:00:51.070> rather<00:00:51.550> a<00:00:51.670> 2<00:00:51.790> amp<00:00:52.180> port<00:00:52.540> another<00:00:53.200> to

got a 2.1 rather a 2 amp port another to
import<00:00:53.950> and<00:00:54.100> 2-1<00:00:54.640> amp<00:00:54.820> ports<00:00:55.270> all<00:00:55.510> you<00:00:55.900> do<00:00:56.020> is

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:56.170 
import and 2-1 amp ports all you do is

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:57.720 
import and 2-1 amp ports all you do is
plug<00:00:56.350> it<00:00:56.500> into<00:00:56.620> the<00:00:56.800> wall<00:00:56.980> and<00:00:57.010> it<00:00:57.250> can<00:00:57.430> provide

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:57.730 
plug it into the wall and it can provide

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:00.070 
a total of up to 5 amps so you'll notice

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.310 
a total of up to 5 amps so you'll notice
this<00:01:00.250> is<00:01:00.310> a<00:01:00.460> little<00:01:00.820> bit<00:01:00.940> less<00:01:01.300> than<00:01:01.870> the<00:01:01.930> 6

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:02.320 
this is a little bit less than the 6

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:04.020 
this is a little bit less than the 6
amps<00:01:02.680> of<00:01:02.829> total<00:01:03.280> power<00:01:03.550> that<00:01:03.880> it<00:01:04.000> can

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:04.030 
amps of total power that it can

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:05.999 
amps of total power that it can
theoretically<00:01:04.689> deliver<00:01:05.290> on<00:01:05.439> the<00:01:05.560> ports<00:01:05.829> but

00:01:05.999 --> 00:01:06.009 
theoretically deliver on the ports but

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:07.560 
theoretically deliver on the ports but
that's<00:01:06.159> fine<00:01:06.430> it<00:01:06.820> just<00:01:07.060> means<00:01:07.240> that<00:01:07.329> things

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:07.570 
that's fine it just means that things

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:08.880 
that's fine it just means that things
will<00:01:07.689> go<00:01:07.780> a<00:01:07.810> little<00:01:07.930> bit<00:01:08.110> slower<00:01:08.439> if<00:01:08.740> you

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:08.890 
will go a little bit slower if you

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:10.560 
will go a little bit slower if you
occupy<00:01:09.400> all<00:01:09.670> of<00:01:09.700> them<00:01:10.030> in<00:01:10.119> your<00:01:10.210> charging

decent amount of amperage on each of the

ports so you could plug a bunch of
things<00:01:39.850> into<00:01:40.120> it<00:01:40.150> but<00:01:40.390> they'd<00:01:40.510> be<00:01:40.570> limited<00:01:41.020> to

for<00:03:41.739> the<00:03:41.799> battery<00:03:42.099> life<00:03:42.280> so<00:03:42.430> you<00:03:42.519> can<00:03:42.669> see

00:03:42.809 --> 00:03:42.819 
for the battery life so you can see

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:45.270 
for the battery life so you can see
right<00:03:42.970> around<00:03:43.120> 80%<00:03:44.109> on<00:03:44.290> the<00:03:44.739> three<00:03:44.979> sides

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
right around 80% on the three sides

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:46.740 
right around 80% on the three sides
there's<00:03:45.549> nothing<00:03:45.819> other<00:03:45.939> than<00:03:46.150> screws<00:03:46.479> and<00:03:46.659> on

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:46.750 
there's nothing other than screws and on

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:47.999 
there's nothing other than screws and on
the<00:03:46.870> bottom<00:03:47.109> you've<00:03:47.229> got<00:03:47.259> some<00:03:47.590> little<00:03:47.680> feet

00:03:47.999 --> 00:03:48.009 
the bottom you've got some little feet

00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:49.619 
the bottom you've got some little feet
to<00:03:48.040> hold<00:03:48.400> it<00:03:48.519> in<00:03:48.609> place<00:03:48.849> so<00:03:48.879> what<00:03:49.150> the<00:03:49.239> devil<00:03:49.509> is

00:03:49.619 --> 00:03:49.629 
to hold it in place so what the devil is

00:03:49.629 --> 00:03:52.229 
to hold it in place so what the devil is
this<00:03:49.810> thing<00:03:50.019> it<00:03:50.109> is<00:03:50.229> a<00:03:50.319> twenty<00:03:50.799> six<00:03:51.239> thousand

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:52.239 
this thing it is a twenty six thousand

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:56.069 
this thing it is a twenty six thousand
milliamp<00:03:52.989> hour<00:03:53.609> essentially<00:03:54.780> battery<00:03:55.780> bank
