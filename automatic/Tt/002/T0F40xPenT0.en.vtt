00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.830 
getting on trees last team alive wins
and<00:01:26.009> the<00:01:26.310> spawn<00:01:26.549> is<00:01:26.670> in<00:01:26.759> the<00:01:26.850> sky<00:01:27.030> so<00:01:27.330> right

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840 
and the spawn is in the sky so right

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:29.300 
and the spawn is in the sky so right
there<00:01:28.110> I<00:01:28.320> don't<00:01:28.560> even<00:01:28.710> need<00:01:28.829> to<00:01:28.950> see<00:01:29.040> a<00:01:29.070> hunter

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
there I don't even need to see a hunter

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.069 
there I don't even need to see a hunter
but<00:01:29.490> it's<00:01:29.640> like<00:01:29.759> a<00:01:29.820> 1<00:01:30.000> V<00:01:30.119> 3<00:01:30.150> it's<00:01:30.630> pretty<00:01:30.960> much

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
but it's like a 1 V 3 it's pretty much

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.600 
but it's like a 1 V 3 it's pretty much
the<00:01:31.200> same<00:01:31.350> rules<00:01:31.619> except<00:01:31.950> the<00:01:32.040> animals<00:01:32.490> are

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
the same rules except the animals are

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:33.950 
the same rules except the animals are
allowed<00:01:32.729> to<00:01:32.850> get<00:01:32.939> on<00:01:33.000> the<00:01:33.119> trees<00:01:33.360> instead<00:01:33.780> of

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
allowed to get on the trees instead of

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.990 
allowed to get on the trees instead of
just<00:01:34.200> the<00:01:34.380> monster<00:01:34.799> so<00:01:35.310> here's<00:01:35.490> Mike<00:01:35.700> might

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
just the monster so here's Mike might

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.940 
just the monster so here's Mike might
need<00:01:36.390> to<00:01:36.509> begin<00:01:36.630> and<00:01:36.840> then<00:01:36.930> I<00:01:36.960> got<00:01:37.140> the<00:01:37.560> map<00:01:37.740> on

switch so well happen he'll be ready

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:46.219 
switch so well happen he'll be ready
he'll<00:01:45.000> flip<00:01:45.149> the<00:01:45.270> switch<00:01:45.479> it'll<00:01:45.689> run<00:01:45.869> out<00:01:45.899> and

he actually gets a speed to buff so he'd

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:50.149

00:04:15.199 --> 00:04:15.209 
another player from across the map so

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:16.370 
another player from across the map so
they<00:04:15.330> would<00:04:15.480> know<00:04:15.600> where<00:04:15.780> you<00:04:15.900> are<00:04:15.930> so<00:04:16.260> it's

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:16.380 
they would know where you are so it's

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:18.199 
they would know where you are so it's
very<00:04:16.470> important<00:04:16.980> that<00:04:17.040> you<00:04:17.400> kind<00:04:17.700> of<00:04:17.820> sneak

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
very important that you kind of sneak

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:20.270 
very important that you kind of sneak
around<00:04:18.359> a<00:04:18.690> trapper<00:04:19.049> kill<00:04:19.650> them<00:04:19.830> as<00:04:19.919> fast<00:04:20.130> as

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:20.280 
around a trapper kill them as fast as

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:20.840 
around a trapper kill them as fast as
you<00:04:20.340> can

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:20.850 
you can

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:22.570 
you can
any<00:04:21.359> of<00:04:21.510> these<00:04:21.630> salt<00:04:21.870> would<00:04:22.020> just<00:04:22.140> go<00:04:22.260> around

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580 
any of these salt would just go around

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:24.339 
any of these salt would just go around
because<00:04:22.909> I'm<00:04:23.030> making<00:04:23.509> this<00:04:23.720> map<00:04:23.930> kind<00:04:24.229> of<00:04:24.289> in

00:04:24.339 --> 00:04:24.349 
because I'm making this map kind of in

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:52.370 
night vision of course you can easily

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:54.159 
night vision of course you can easily
see<00:04:52.819> while<00:04:53.060> they'll<00:04:53.270> be<00:04:53.449> having<00:04:53.750> trouble

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:54.169 
see while they'll be having trouble

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:57.610 
see while they'll be having trouble
seeing<00:04:54.409> so<00:04:54.620> you<00:04:54.740> can<00:04:54.919> get<00:04:55.099> some<00:04:55.310> nice<00:04:56.199> areas<00:04:57.199> to

00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:57.620 
seeing so you can get some nice areas to

00:04:57.620 --> 00:04:59.260 
seeing so you can get some nice areas to
catch<00:04:57.800> them<00:04:58.039> if<00:04:58.280> they<00:04:58.430> catch<00:04:58.639> you<00:04:58.909> then<00:04:59.090> you

00:04:59.260 --> 00:04:59.270 
catch them if they catch you then you

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:00.730 
catch them if they catch you then you
probably<00:04:59.569> just<00:04:59.690> want<00:04:59.810> to<00:04:59.900> hide<00:05:00.080> but<00:05:00.349> you<00:05:00.409> get

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:00.740 
probably just want to hide but you get

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:02.439 
probably just want to hide but you get
to<00:05:00.889> just<00:05:01.219> have<00:05:01.430> the<00:05:01.550> advantage<00:05:02.030> of<00:05:02.150> seeing

00:05:02.439 --> 00:05:02.449 
to just have the advantage of seeing

00:05:02.449 --> 00:05:04.629 
to just have the advantage of seeing
very<00:05:02.780> well<00:05:03.080> and<00:05:03.440> that's<00:05:03.919> kind<00:05:04.129> of<00:05:04.400> pretty

00:05:04.629 --> 00:05:04.639 
very well and that's kind of pretty

00:05:04.639 --> 00:05:07.270 
very well and that's kind of pretty
straightforward<00:05:05.360> it's<00:05:05.900> two<00:05:06.560> hills<00:05:06.800> so<00:05:07.069> this

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:07.280 
straightforward it's two hills so this

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:09.100 
straightforward it's two hills so this
is<00:05:07.400> a<00:05:07.430> hill<00:05:07.639> of<00:05:08.120> course<00:05:08.389> and<00:05:08.629> then<00:05:08.810> this<00:05:08.930> one

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:09.110 
is a hill of course and then this one

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:10.869 
is a hill of course and then this one
over<00:05:09.289> there<00:05:09.409> and<00:05:09.620> then<00:05:10.280> it's<00:05:10.430> like<00:05:10.580> a<00:05:10.610> little

00:05:10.869 --> 00:05:10.879 
over there and then it's like a little

00:05:10.879 --> 00:05:12.610 
over there and then it's like a little
valley<00:05:11.060> with<00:05:11.569> the<00:05:11.599> river<00:05:12.169> through<00:05:12.349> it<00:05:12.440> and

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:12.620 
valley with the river through it and

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:14.529 
valley with the river through it and
that's<00:05:13.129> pretty<00:05:13.460> much<00:05:13.669> it<00:05:13.940> and<00:05:14.240> I<00:05:14.360> know<00:05:14.419> the

00:05:14.529 --> 00:05:14.539 
that's pretty much it and I know the

00:05:14.539 --> 00:05:16.029 
that's pretty much it and I know the
mountains<00:05:14.810> kind<00:05:15.020> of<00:05:15.229> suck<00:05:15.409> but<00:05:15.590> it<00:05:15.740> took<00:05:15.830> me<00:05:16.009> a

00:05:16.029 --> 00:05:16.039 
mountains kind of suck but it took me a

00:05:16.039 --> 00:05:18.730 
mountains kind of suck but it took me a
while<00:05:16.129> to<00:05:16.190> even<00:05:16.279> make<00:05:16.550> them<00:05:16.789> so<00:05:17.029> cuz<00:05:17.690> just<00:05:18.319> does

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:18.740 
while to even make them so cuz just does

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:21.010 
while to even make them so cuz just does
making<00:05:19.430> them<00:05:19.639> that<00:05:19.789> high<00:05:19.940> and<00:05:20.180> it's<00:05:20.689> just

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:21.020 
making them that high and it's just

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:22.769 
making them that high and it's just
pretty<00:05:21.229> much<00:05:21.319> stacking<00:05:22.039> them<00:05:22.129> up<00:05:22.219> in<00:05:22.400> like

00:05:22.769 --> 00:05:22.779 
pretty much stacking them up in like

00:05:22.779 --> 00:05:26.619 
pretty much stacking them up in like
fashions<00:05:23.779> of<00:05:23.930> straight<00:05:24.439> up<00:05:24.819> but<00:05:25.819> yeah<00:05:26.419> so

00:05:26.619 --> 00:05:26.629 
fashions of straight up but yeah so

00:05:26.629 --> 00:05:28.659 
fashions of straight up but yeah so
where's<00:05:26.870> one<00:05:27.349> of<00:05:27.440> these<00:05:27.590> at<00:05:27.949> there<00:05:28.310> it<00:05:28.370> is

00:05:28.659 --> 00:05:28.669 
where's one of these at there it is

00:05:28.669 --> 00:05:30.939 
where's one of these at there it is
and<00:05:28.969> they're<00:05:29.330> also<00:05:29.539> traps<00:05:30.199> along<00:05:30.409> this<00:05:30.710> which

00:05:30.939 --> 00:05:30.949 
and they're also traps along this which

00:05:30.949 --> 00:05:33.309 
and they're also traps along this which
can<00:05:31.129> be<00:05:31.219> used<00:05:31.400> against<00:05:31.610> both<00:05:31.849> creatures<00:05:32.389> both

00:05:33.309 --> 00:05:33.319 
can be used against both creatures both

00:05:33.319 --> 00:05:34.809 
can be used against both creatures both
games<00:05:33.740> so<00:05:33.949> if<00:05:34.039> you<00:05:34.129> step<00:05:34.370> on<00:05:34.520> it<00:05:34.699> without

00:05:34.809 --> 00:05:34.819 
games so if you step on it without

00:05:34.819 --> 00:05:38.110 
games so if you step on it without
realizing<00:05:35.120> it<00:05:35.599> was<00:05:35.779> funny<00:05:36.099> little<00:05:37.120> spider

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:38.120 
realizing it was funny little spider

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:39.999 
realizing it was funny little spider
that<00:05:38.779> will<00:05:38.930> poison<00:05:39.139> you<00:05:39.379> or<00:05:39.589> something<00:05:39.860> like

00:05:39.999 --> 00:05:40.009 
that will poison you or something like

00:05:40.009 --> 00:05:41.680 
that will poison you or something like
that<00:05:40.159> so<00:05:40.279> it's<00:05:40.400> just<00:05:40.550> a<00:05:40.610> pain<00:05:40.819> added<00:05:41.539> in<00:05:41.629> the

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:41.690 
that so it's just a pain added in the

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:42.999 
that so it's just a pain added in the
map<00:05:41.870> so<00:05:42.020> you<00:05:42.110> want<00:05:42.229> to<00:05:42.319> watch<00:05:42.440> for<00:05:42.589> your<00:05:42.710> steps

00:05:42.999 --> 00:05:43.009 
map so you want to watch for your steps

00:05:43.009 --> 00:05:44.409 
map so you want to watch for your steps
every<00:05:43.250> now<00:05:43.400> and<00:05:43.550> then<00:05:43.610> there's<00:05:43.789> only<00:05:43.849> like<00:05:44.089> ten

00:05:44.409 --> 00:05:44.419 
every now and then there's only like ten

00:05:44.419 --> 00:05:46.149 
every now and then there's only like ten
of<00:05:44.539> them<00:05:44.629> I<00:05:44.719> think<00:05:44.779> or<00:05:45.080> nine<00:05:45.229> of<00:05:45.259> them<00:05:45.469> so<00:05:46.099> you

00:05:46.149 --> 00:05:46.159 
of them I think or nine of them so you

00:05:46.159 --> 00:05:47.980 
of them I think or nine of them so you
don't<00:05:46.370> you<00:05:46.669> just<00:05:46.879> kind<00:05:47.029> of<00:05:47.120> accidentally<00:05:47.750> run

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:47.990 
don't you just kind of accidentally run

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:49.360 
don't you just kind of accidentally run
on<00:05:48.110> them<00:05:48.349> if<00:05:48.440> you<00:05:48.529> weren't<00:05:48.710> paying<00:05:48.860> attention

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:49.370 
on them if you weren't paying attention

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:50.740 
on them if you weren't paying attention
which<00:05:49.490> will<00:05:49.729> make<00:05:49.879> like<00:05:50.029> another<00:05:50.389> little

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:50.750 
which will make like another little

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:53.079 
which will make like another little
hostile<00:05:51.110> creature<00:05:51.379> after<00:05:51.889> you<00:05:52.069> especially<00:05:52.940> on

00:05:53.079 --> 00:05:53.089 
hostile creature after you especially on

00:05:53.089 --> 00:05:54.610 
hostile creature after you especially on
high-speed<00:05:53.330> chases<00:05:53.659> so<00:05:54.259> if<00:05:54.349> you're<00:05:54.500> like

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:54.620 
high-speed chases so if you're like

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:55.809 
high-speed chases so if you're like
running<00:05:54.889> and<00:05:55.159> you're<00:05:55.250> not<00:05:55.370> really<00:05:55.610> paying

00:05:55.809 --> 00:05:55.819 
running and you're not really paying

00:05:55.819 --> 00:05:56.920 
running and you're not really paying
attention<00:05:55.940> anything<00:05:56.509> you're<00:05:56.629> trying<00:05:56.779> to

00:05:56.920 --> 00:05:56.930 
attention anything you're trying to

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:01.600 
attention anything you're trying to
speed<00:05:59.110> that's<00:06:00.110> you<00:06:01.069> knowing<00:06:01.400> you<00:06:01.430> could

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:01.610 
speed that's you knowing you could

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:03.459 
speed that's you knowing you could
accidentally<00:06:02.060> step<00:06:02.360> on<00:06:02.479> one<00:06:02.719> but<00:06:03.169> you'd<00:06:03.319> also

00:06:03.459 --> 00:06:03.469 
accidentally step on one but you'd also

00:06:03.469 --> 00:06:05.019 
accidentally step on one but you'd also
go<00:06:03.830> to<00:06:03.889> your<00:06:04.069> advantage<00:06:04.460> so<00:06:04.580> if<00:06:04.729> someone's

00:06:05.019 --> 00:06:05.029 
go to your advantage so if someone's

00:06:05.029 --> 00:06:06.579 
go to your advantage so if someone's
following<00:06:05.180> you<00:06:05.419> they<00:06:05.599> will<00:06:05.750> hit<00:06:06.229> the<00:06:06.319> spider

00:06:06.579 --> 00:06:06.589 
following you they will hit the spider

00:06:06.589 --> 00:06:09.579 
following you they will hit the spider
but<00:06:07.490> that<00:06:07.669> is<00:06:07.789> the<00:06:07.879> map<00:06:08.089> right<00:06:08.330> there<00:06:08.589> another

00:06:09.579 --> 00:06:09.589 
but that is the map right there another

00:06:09.589 --> 00:06:13.930 
but that is the map right there another
thing<00:06:09.889> is<00:06:10.099> that<00:06:10.129> the<00:06:10.669> river<00:06:11.629> is<00:06:11.900> lit<00:06:12.379> up<00:06:12.560> I<00:06:12.940> have

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:13.940 
thing is that the river is lit up I have

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:16.570 
thing is that the river is lit up I have
a<00:06:13.969> thought<00:06:14.810> of<00:06:14.839> starting<00:06:15.259> sometimes<00:06:15.589> but<00:06:16.490> the

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:16.580 
a thought of starting sometimes but the

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:19.020 
a thought of starting sometimes but the
river<00:06:16.849> is<00:06:16.969> actually<00:06:17.180> lit<00:06:17.690> up<00:06:17.870> so<00:06:18.229> it's

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:19.030 
river is actually lit up so it's

00:06:19.030 --> 00:06:21.340 
river is actually lit up so it's
anyone<00:06:20.030> who<00:06:20.150> crosses<00:06:20.420> it<00:06:20.690> will<00:06:20.780> easily<00:06:21.020> be

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:21.350 
anyone who crosses it will easily be

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:23.650 
anyone who crosses it will easily be
seen<00:06:21.620> and<00:06:21.950> one<00:06:22.910> more<00:06:23.030> thing<00:06:23.180> about<00:06:23.330> the<00:06:23.480> rules

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:23.660 
seen and one more thing about the rules

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:25.240 
seen and one more thing about the rules
I<00:06:23.840> think<00:06:23.870> I<00:06:24.080> forgot<00:06:24.350> is<00:06:24.530> that<00:06:24.560> make<00:06:25.040> sure<00:06:25.160> you

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:25.250 
I think I forgot is that make sure you

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:27.970 
I think I forgot is that make sure you
have<00:06:25.430> daylight<00:06:25.910> cycle<00:06:26.240> off<00:06:26.660> and<00:06:27.380> what<00:06:27.650> that<00:06:27.800> is

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:27.980 
have daylight cycle off and what that is

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:30.340 
have daylight cycle off and what that is
is<00:06:28.280> this<00:06:28.760> one<00:06:29.000> it'll<00:06:29.420> make<00:06:29.720> it<00:06:29.840> forever<00:06:30.080> night

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:30.350 
is this one it'll make it forever night

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:31.900 
is this one it'll make it forever night
that's<00:06:30.590> a<00:06:30.740> very<00:06:30.920> important<00:06:31.340> part<00:06:31.550> of<00:06:31.580> this<00:06:31.730> map

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:31.910 
that's a very important part of this map

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:33.190 
that's a very important part of this map
because<00:06:32.120> that's<00:06:32.510> how<00:06:32.630> it<00:06:32.780> makes<00:06:32.900> it<00:06:33.050> the

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:33.200 
because that's how it makes it the

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:35.560 
because that's how it makes it the
stealth<00:06:33.500> into<00:06:34.430> it<00:06:34.580> too<00:06:34.790> so<00:06:35.270> it's<00:06:35.420> not<00:06:35.480> just

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:35.570 
stealth into it too so it's not just

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:37.510 
stealth into it too so it's not just
fighting<00:06:36.350> it's<00:06:36.500> stealth<00:06:36.860> and<00:06:37.070> kind<00:06:37.280> of<00:06:37.340> being

00:06:37.510 --> 00:06:37.520 
fighting it's stealth and kind of being

00:06:37.520 --> 00:06:38.710 
fighting it's stealth and kind of being
a<00:06:37.640> little<00:06:37.940> more<00:06:38.150> stretched

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:38.720 
a little more stretched

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:41.050 
a little more stretched
strategic<00:06:39.350> compared<00:06:40.340> to<00:06:40.460> other<00:06:40.580> ones<00:06:40.670> a<00:06:40.940> new

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:41.060 
strategic compared to other ones a new

00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:42.700 
strategic compared to other ones a new
trailer<00:06:41.300> jump<00:06:41.600> but<00:06:41.810> it<00:06:42.020> I<00:06:42.230> think<00:06:42.260> it's<00:06:42.530> gonna

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:42.710 
trailer jump but it I think it's gonna

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:44.950 
trailer jump but it I think it's gonna
be<00:06:42.890> pretty<00:06:43.280> cool<00:06:43.490> folk<00:06:43.760> I<00:06:43.970> did<00:06:44.540> enjoy<00:06:44.840> this
