in<00:00:01.319> this<00:00:01.589> video<00:00:01.890> we're<00:00:02.220> going<00:00:02.340> to<00:00:02.460> look<00:00:02.580> at<00:00:02.730> how

00:00:02.869 --> 00:00:02.879 
in this video we're going to look at how

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:05.660 
in this video we're going to look at how
to<00:00:02.939> do<00:00:03.179> sums<00:00:03.540> in<00:00:03.929> standard<00:00:04.529> form<00:00:04.799> or<00:00:05.040> sums<00:00:05.370> with

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:05.670 
to do sums in standard form or sums with

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:08.089 
to do sums in standard form or sums with
numbers<00:00:06.089> that<00:00:06.240> are<00:00:06.390> in<00:00:06.540> standard<00:00:07.020> form<00:00:07.259> this

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:08.099 
numbers that are in standard form this

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:10.459 
numbers that are in standard form this
example<00:00:08.519> for<00:00:08.849> you<00:00:08.970> here<00:00:09.240> you<00:00:09.420> may<00:00:10.050> have<00:00:10.080> to<00:00:10.290> do

00:00:10.459 --> 00:00:10.469 
example for you here you may have to do

00:00:10.469 --> 00:00:12.830 
example for you here you may have to do
a<00:00:10.500> multiplying<00:00:11.250> some<00:00:11.610> with<00:00:12.240> two<00:00:12.450> numbers

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:12.840 
a multiplying some with two numbers

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:15.560 
a multiplying some with two numbers
which<00:00:13.410> are<00:00:13.590> both<00:00:13.740> in<00:00:14.040> standard<00:00:14.610> form<00:00:14.880> so<00:00:15.089> I've

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
which are both in standard form so I've

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.210 
which are both in standard form so I've
got<00:00:15.719> to<00:00:15.929> point<00:00:16.139> three<00:00:16.500> times<00:00:16.710> ten<00:00:16.920> to<00:00:17.190> the

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
got to point three times ten to the

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.269 
got to point three times ten to the
power<00:00:17.460> of<00:00:17.520> five<00:00:17.820> times<00:00:18.660> two<00:00:19.410> point<00:00:19.680> one<00:00:19.920> times

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:20.279 
power of five times two point one times

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:22.910 
power of five times two point one times
ten<00:00:20.609> to<00:00:20.730> the<00:00:20.760> power<00:00:21.000> of<00:00:21.060> four<00:00:21.710> we're<00:00:22.710> going<00:00:22.859> to

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
ten to the power of four we're going to

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.849 
ten to the power of four we're going to
do<00:00:23.010> this<00:00:23.130> without<00:00:23.279> a<00:00:23.460> calculator<00:00:24.650> first<00:00:25.650> thing

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:25.859 
do this without a calculator first thing

00:00:25.859 --> 00:00:28.099 
do this without a calculator first thing
you<00:00:25.949> can<00:00:26.070> do<00:00:26.279> if<00:00:26.820> your<00:00:27.090> time<00:00:27.300> thing<00:00:27.599> you<00:00:27.930> can

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
you can do if your time thing you can

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.259 
you can do if your time thing you can
write<00:00:28.289> the<00:00:28.439> some<00:00:28.680> numbers<00:00:29.279> down<00:00:29.460> at<00:00:29.609> any<00:00:29.789> order

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269

in<00:01:04.860> this<00:01:05.010> multiplication<00:01:05.640> grid<00:01:06.650> two<00:01:07.650> twos<00:01:08.159> are

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
in this multiplication grid two twos are

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.260 
in this multiplication grid two twos are
four<00:01:08.460> and<00:01:09.030> I<00:01:09.510> have<00:01:09.659> two<00:01:09.930> notes<00:01:10.200> so<00:01:10.500> that's<00:01:11.270> 420

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
four and I have two notes so that's 420

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:17.480 
four and I have two notes so that's 420
times<00:01:12.479> by<00:01:13.189> 360<00:01:14.189> 20<00:01:15.030> times<00:01:15.270> by<00:01:15.420> one<00:01:15.689> is<00:01:16.280> 21<00:01:17.280> times

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
times by 360 20 times by one is 21 times

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.270 
times by 360 20 times by one is 21 times
by<00:01:17.759> three<00:01:18.150> is<00:01:18.840> three<00:01:19.200> if<00:01:19.500> I<00:01:19.619> add<00:01:19.799> the<00:01:19.950> numbers

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
by three is three if I add the numbers

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:26.240 
by three is three if I add the numbers
inside<00:01:20.430> the<00:01:20.729> grid<00:01:20.909> up<00:01:21.979> 460<00:01:23.210> 480<00:01:24.210> three<00:01:25.250> four

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:26.250 
inside the grid up 460 480 three four

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:28.670 
inside the grid up 460 480 three four
eight<00:01:26.460> three<00:01:26.600> so<00:01:27.600> I've<00:01:27.810> got<00:01:28.020> twenty-one

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
eight three so I've got twenty-one

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:34.010 
eight three so I've got twenty-one
twenty<00:01:29.520> three<00:01:29.700> times<00:01:29.880> by<00:01:30.119> 21<00:01:30.659> is<00:01:31.400> 483<00:01:33.020> the

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:34.020 
twenty three times by 21 is 483 the

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.480 
twenty three times by 21 is 483 the
question<00:01:34.380> I<00:01:34.470> was<00:01:34.650> trying<00:01:34.680> to<00:01:35.009> do<00:01:35.130> with<00:01:35.220> two

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
question I was trying to do with two

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:38.539 
question I was trying to do with two
point<00:01:35.880> three<00:01:36.119> and<00:01:36.390> two<00:01:36.990> point<00:01:37.259> one<00:01:37.560> and<00:01:38.460> I've

00:01:38.539 --> 00:01:38.549 
point three and two point one and I've

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:40.580 
point three and two point one and I've
underlined<00:01:39.030> here<00:01:39.180> two<00:01:39.840> digits<00:01:40.320> that<00:01:40.470> were

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
underlined here two digits that were

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:43.280 
underlined here two digits that were
after<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:41.100> decimal<00:01:41.250> point<00:01:41.670> so<00:01:42.229> for<00:01:43.229> the

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290 
after the decimal point so for the

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.380 
after the decimal point so for the
answer<00:01:43.649> I<00:01:43.680> need<00:01:43.799> two<00:01:44.520> of<00:01:44.549> these<00:01:44.850> need<00:01:45.180> to<00:01:45.299> be

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
answer I need two of these need to be

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.719 
answer I need two of these need to be
after<00:01:45.780> the<00:01:45.899> decimal<00:01:46.049> point<00:01:46.439> so<00:01:46.740> that<00:01:47.549> will<00:01:47.640> be

00:01:47.719 --> 00:01:47.729 
after the decimal point so that will be

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:50.179 
after the decimal point so that will be
four<00:01:48.210> point<00:01:48.509> eight<00:01:48.659> three<00:01:48.950> will<00:01:49.950> be<00:01:50.040> the

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
four point eight three will be the

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:53.179 
four point eight three will be the
answer<00:01:50.520> to<00:01:50.640> that<00:01:50.670> sum<00:01:51.560> so<00:01:52.560> if<00:01:52.710> I<00:01:52.829> look<00:01:52.979> at<00:01:53.070> the

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
answer to that sum so if I look at the

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.609 
answer to that sum so if I look at the
line<00:01:53.369> I've<00:01:53.549> got<00:01:53.759> here<00:01:54.060> I've<00:01:54.899> just<00:01:54.960> worked<00:01:55.409> out

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
line I've got here I've just worked out

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.980 
line I've got here I've just worked out
that<00:01:56.009> the<00:01:56.460> two<00:01:56.670> point<00:01:56.939> three<00:01:57.180> times<00:01:57.509> two<00:01:57.780> point

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:57.990 
that the two point three times two point

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.319 
that the two point three times two point
one<00:01:58.290> is<00:01:58.619> four<00:01:59.549> point<00:01:59.820> eight<00:01:59.939> three

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
one is four point eight three

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.929 
one is four point eight three
I<00:02:00.619> still<00:02:01.619> now<00:02:01.799> got<00:02:02.009> to<00:02:02.130> deal<00:02:02.310> with<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.579> 10<00:02:02.820> to

00:02:02.929 --> 00:02:02.939 
I still now got to deal with the 10 to

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.389 
I still now got to deal with the 10 to
the<00:02:03.060> power<00:02:03.210> of<00:02:03.270> five<00:02:03.600> times<00:02:04.530> by<00:02:04.770> the<00:02:04.829> 10<00:02:05.159> to<00:02:05.310> the

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399 
the power of five times by the 10 to the

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:08.690 
the power of five times by the 10 to the
power<00:02:05.579> of<00:02:05.640> four<00:02:06.920> and<00:02:07.920> if<00:02:08.009> I<00:02:08.099> look<00:02:08.220> at<00:02:08.340> this<00:02:08.489> bit

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
power of four and if I look at this bit

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.360 
power of four and if I look at this bit
here<00:02:08.879> using<00:02:09.509> my<00:02:09.599> laws<00:02:09.810> of<00:02:10.020> indices<00:02:10.470> if<00:02:10.770> the<00:02:11.160> big

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
here using my laws of indices if the big

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.690 
here using my laws of indices if the big
numbers<00:02:11.730> are<00:02:11.879> the<00:02:12.000> same<00:02:12.270> and<00:02:12.599> I<00:02:12.959> multiply

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
numbers are the same and I multiply

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.240 
numbers are the same and I multiply
all<00:02:14.540> I<00:02:14.569> have<00:02:14.750> to<00:02:14.870> do<00:02:14.989> is<00:02:15.170> add<00:02:15.349> the<00:02:15.860> powers

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:16.250 
all I have to do is add the powers

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:19.119 
all I have to do is add the powers
together<00:02:16.610> so<00:02:17.569> 10<00:02:17.810> to<00:02:17.959> the<00:02:18.050> power<00:02:18.200> of<00:02:18.260> 5<00:02:18.620> times

00:02:19.119 --> 00:02:19.129 
together so 10 to the power of 5 times

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:21.339 
together so 10 to the power of 5 times
10<00:02:19.400> to<00:02:19.519> the<00:02:19.580> power<00:02:19.790> of<00:02:19.849> 4<00:02:20.180> is<00:02:20.810> 10<00:02:21.080> to<00:02:21.230> the<00:02:21.290> power

00:02:21.339 --> 00:02:21.349 
10 to the power of 4 is 10 to the power

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:24.360 
10 to the power of 4 is 10 to the power
of<00:02:21.530> 9<00:02:22.420> so<00:02:23.420> there's<00:02:23.599> my<00:02:23.720> answer

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
of 9 so there's my answer

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.839 
of 9 so there's my answer
4.83<00:02:25.370> times<00:02:26.300> 10<00:02:26.629> to<00:02:26.989> the<00:02:27.110> power<00:02:27.319> of<00:02:27.590> 9<00:02:28.010> all<00:02:28.489> done

00:02:28.839 --> 00:02:28.849 
4.83 times 10 to the power of 9 all done

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:32.740 
4.83 times 10 to the power of 9 all done
without<00:02:29.420> a<00:02:29.810> calculator<00:02:31.300> if<00:02:32.300> I<00:02:32.390> look<00:02:32.569> at<00:02:32.660> a

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:32.750 
without a calculator if I look at a

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:33.880 
without a calculator if I look at a
second<00:02:33.140> example

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:33.890 
second example

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:37.990 
second example
so<00:02:34.670> another<00:02:35.540> example<00:02:35.750> 5<00:02:36.620> times<00:02:37.519> 10<00:02:37.819> to<00:02:37.970> the

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
so another example 5 times 10 to the

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.030 
so another example 5 times 10 to the
power<00:02:38.239> of<00:02:38.300> 6<00:02:38.799> times<00:02:39.799> by<00:02:40.630> 6<00:02:41.630> times<00:02:42.500> 10<00:02:42.830> to<00:02:42.980> the

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:43.040 
power of 6 times by 6 times 10 to the

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:47.080 
power of 6 times by 6 times 10 to the
power<00:02:43.280> of<00:02:43.340> 3<00:02:45.220> you<00:02:46.220> don't<00:02:46.340> need<00:02:46.549> the<00:02:46.700> brackets

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:47.090 
power of 3 you don't need the brackets

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.150 
power of 3 you don't need the brackets
here<00:02:47.269> but<00:02:47.750> often<00:02:48.080> you<00:02:48.170> will<00:02:48.319> find<00:02:48.620> brackets<00:02:49.040> on

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160 
here but often you will find brackets on

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.460 
here but often you will find brackets on
these<00:02:49.280> questions<00:02:49.780> I'll<00:02:50.780> do<00:02:50.989> what<00:02:51.110> I<00:02:51.200> did<00:02:51.260> last

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470 
these questions I'll do what I did last

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.259 
these questions I'll do what I did last
time<00:02:51.650> I'll<00:02:52.069> write<00:02:52.310> down<00:02:52.489> the<00:02:52.579> normal<00:02:52.819> numbers

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:53.269 
time I'll write down the normal numbers

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:57.610 
time I'll write down the normal numbers
first<00:02:53.569> 5<00:02:54.049> &amp;<00:02:54.410> 6<00:02:55.780> they're<00:02:56.780> being<00:02:56.930> x<00:02:57.230> together

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
first 5 &amp; 6 they're being x together

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.509 
first 5 &amp; 6 they're being x together
then<00:02:58.400> 10<00:02:59.060> to<00:02:59.209> the<00:02:59.329> power<00:02:59.510> of<00:02:59.569> 6<00:02:59.989> and<00:03:00.290> 10<00:03:01.250> to<00:03:01.400> the

00:03:01.509 --> 00:03:01.519 
then 10 to the power of 6 and 10 to the

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:05.860 
then 10 to the power of 6 and 10 to the

our<00:03:06.049> 30<00:03:06.640> if<00:03:07.640> I<00:03:07.730> times<00:03:08.060> those<00:03:08.299> together<00:03:08.510> I<00:03:08.930> would

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:09.290 
our 30 if I times those together I would

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.800 
our 30 if I times those together I would
just<00:03:09.410> be<00:03:09.530> adding<00:03:09.890> the<00:03:10.010> powers<00:03:10.400> so<00:03:11.180> I<00:03:11.209> get<00:03:11.480> 10<00:03:11.690> to

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:11.810 
just be adding the powers so I get 10 to

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:15.370 
just be adding the powers so I get 10 to
the<00:03:11.900> power<00:03:12.049> of<00:03:12.110> 9<00:03:12.670> 30<00:03:13.670> times<00:03:14.450> my<00:03:14.630> pen<00:03:14.870> 10<00:03:15.110> to<00:03:15.260> the

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:15.380 
the power of 9 30 times my pen 10 to the

the power of 9 30 times my pen 10 to the
power<00:03:15.530> of<00:03:15.590> 9<00:03:15.890> it's<00:03:16.640> very<00:03:16.849> tempting<00:03:17.209> to<00:03:17.780> think

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:17.989 
power of 9 it's very tempting to think

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:19.960 
power of 9 it's very tempting to think
that's<00:03:18.620> your<00:03:18.769> final<00:03:18.980> answer<00:03:19.220> but<00:03:19.579> actually

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
that's your final answer but actually

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:23.379 
that's your final answer but actually
isn't<00:03:20.950> because<00:03:21.950> in<00:03:22.069> standard<00:03:22.489> form<00:03:22.760> this

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:23.389 
isn't because in standard form this

00:03:23.389 --> 00:03:26.229 
isn't because in standard form this
number<00:03:23.750> here<00:03:24.049> has<00:03:24.230> to<00:03:24.739> be<00:03:24.889> between<00:03:25.069> 1<00:03:25.579> and<00:03:25.819> 9

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:26.239 
number here has to be between 1 and 9

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:29.349 
number here has to be between 1 and 9
and<00:03:26.540> 30<00:03:26.810> isn't<00:03:27.200> 30<00:03:27.440> is<00:03:27.590> too<00:03:27.739> big<00:03:27.950> we<00:03:28.269> have<00:03:29.269> to

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:29.359 
and 30 isn't 30 is too big we have to

00:03:29.359 --> 00:03:33.160 
and 30 isn't 30 is too big we have to
change<00:03:29.600> that<00:03:29.780> number<00:03:29.930> to<00:03:30.139> 3<00:03:30.769> point<00:03:31.040> naught<00:03:32.170> and

00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:33.170 
change that number to 3 point naught and

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:35.890 
change that number to 3 point naught and
if<00:03:33.260> I<00:03:33.350> make<00:03:33.560> this<00:03:33.709> number<00:03:33.889> smaller<00:03:34.900> to

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:35.900 
if I make this number smaller to

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:38.199 
if I make this number smaller to
compensate<00:03:36.620> I<00:03:36.889> need<00:03:37.430> to<00:03:37.609> make<00:03:37.760> the<00:03:37.910> power

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:38.209 
compensate I need to make the power

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:41.949 
compensate I need to make the power
bigger<00:03:39.700> so<00:03:40.700> if<00:03:40.970> I've<00:03:41.299> made<00:03:41.510> this<00:03:41.630> number

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:41.959 
bigger so if I've made this number

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:45.970 
bigger so if I've made this number
smaller<00:03:42.290> by<00:03:42.769> dividing<00:03:43.340> it<00:03:43.459> by<00:03:43.609> 10<00:03:44.000> I<00:03:44.889> need<00:03:45.889> an

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:45.980 
smaller by dividing it by 10 I need an

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:48.280 
smaller by dividing it by 10 I need an
extra<00:03:46.370> 10<00:03:46.609> here<00:03:47.000> so<00:03:47.389> what<00:03:47.510> I<00:03:47.540> do<00:03:47.630> is<00:03:47.780> I<00:03:47.870> add<00:03:48.049> 1

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
extra 10 here so what I do is I add 1

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:51.490 
extra 10 here so what I do is I add 1
onto<00:03:48.560> that<00:03:48.680> power<00:03:49.120> so<00:03:50.120> I<00:03:50.150> will<00:03:50.389> get<00:03:50.510> 3<00:03:51.230> point

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:51.500 
onto that power so I will get 3 point

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:54.910 
onto that power so I will get 3 point
naught<00:03:51.709> times<00:03:52.519> 10<00:03:52.850> to<00:03:53.030> the<00:03:53.060> power<00:03:53.269> of<00:03:53.329> 10<00:03:53.920> you

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:54.920 
naught times 10 to the power of 10 you

naught times 10 to the power of 10 you
could<00:03:55.100> if<00:03:55.220> you<00:03:55.310> want<00:03:55.489> to<00:03:55.639> miss<00:03:55.850> out<00:03:56.000> the<00:03:56.120> point

00:03:56.349 --> 00:03:56.359 
could if you want to miss out the point

00:03:56.359 --> 00:03:58.979 
could if you want to miss out the point
naught<00:03:56.540> there<00:03:56.810> and<00:03:56.989> just<00:03:57.470> write<00:03:57.680> it<00:03:57.829> down<00:03:57.859> as<00:03:58.579> 3

00:03:58.979 --> 00:03:58.989 
naught there and just write it down as 3

dividing questions we look at 8 times by

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:15.460 
dividing questions we look at 8 times by
10<00:04:10.430> to<00:04:10.609> the<00:04:10.730> power<00:04:10.940> of<00:04:11.000> 5<00:04:12.669> divided<00:04:13.669> by<00:04:13.910> 2<00:04:14.540> times

10 to the power of 3 if you're doing a

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:20.979 
10 to the power of 3 if you're doing a
question<00:04:19.970> like<00:04:20.090> this<00:04:20.120> again<00:04:20.479> you<00:04:20.599> can<00:04:20.750> split

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:20.989 
question like this again you can split

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:24.100 
question like this again you can split
it<00:04:21.049> up<00:04:21.289> you've<00:04:22.010> got<00:04:22.190> 8<00:04:22.810> which<00:04:23.810> is<00:04:23.930> being

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.110 
it up you've got 8 which is being

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:25.580 
it up you've got 8 which is being
divided<00:04:24.440> by<00:04:24.740> 2

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590 
divided by 2

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:27.650 
divided by 2
that's<00:04:25.770> a<00:04:25.889> normal<00:04:26.160> part<00:04:26.370> if<00:04:27.030> you<00:04:27.210> like<00:04:27.389> eight

00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:27.660 
that's a normal part if you like eight

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:33.050 
that's a normal part if you like eight
is<00:04:28.380> divided<00:04:29.040> by<00:04:29.190> two<00:04:30.320> this<00:04:31.400> ten<00:04:32.400> bit<00:04:32.669> you've

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:33.060 
is divided by two this ten bit you've

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:35.810 
is divided by two this ten bit you've
got<00:04:33.300> ten<00:04:33.570> to<00:04:33.690> the<00:04:33.720> power<00:04:33.960> of<00:04:34.020> five<00:04:34.669> which<00:04:35.669> is

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:35.820 
got ten to the power of five which is

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:38.510 
got ten to the power of five which is
being<00:04:36.000> divided<00:04:36.389> by<00:04:37.350> ten<00:04:38.010> to<00:04:38.190> the<00:04:38.250> power<00:04:38.460> of

three but these bits are being
multiplied<00:04:43.050> together<00:04:43.230> these<00:04:43.650> multiplied

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:44.250 
multiplied together these multiplied

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:46.070 
multiplied together these multiplied
signs<00:04:44.580> you<00:04:44.760> can<00:04:44.880> just<00:04:45.090> sort<00:04:45.419> of<00:04:45.450> put<00:04:45.660> in<00:04:45.810> there

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:46.080 
signs you can just sort of put in there

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:48.800 
signs you can just sort of put in there
and<00:04:46.290> now<00:04:46.620> you<00:04:46.710> can<00:04:46.770> think<00:04:47.040> of<00:04:47.220> this<00:04:47.340> as<00:04:47.810> your

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:48.810 
and now you can think of this as your

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:51.650 
and now you can think of this as your
question<00:04:49.169> split<00:04:49.410> up<00:04:49.590> like<00:04:49.740> this<00:04:50.090> 8<00:04:51.090> divided<00:04:51.630> by

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:51.660 
question split up like this 8 divided by

00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:56.030 
question split up like this 8 divided by
2<00:04:51.780> is<00:04:52.440> 4<00:04:53.570> 10<00:04:54.570> to<00:04:54.720> the<00:04:54.810> power<00:04:54.960> of<00:04:55.020> 5<00:04:55.320> divided<00:04:55.889> by

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:56.040 
2 is 4 10 to the power of 5 divided by

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:58.129 
2 is 4 10 to the power of 5 divided by
10<00:04:56.370> to<00:04:56.550> the<00:04:56.580> power<00:04:56.669> of<00:04:56.850> 3<00:04:57.240> because<00:04:57.870> we're

00:04:58.129 --> 00:04:58.139 
10 to the power of 3 because we're

00:04:58.139 --> 00:05:00.170 
10 to the power of 3 because we're
dividing<00:04:58.680> I<00:04:58.860> do<00:04:59.190> a<00:04:59.370> taking<00:04:59.790> away<00:04:59.970> with<00:05:00.090> the

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:00.180 
dividing I do a taking away with the

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:02.870 
dividing I do a taking away with the
powers<00:05:00.510> that's<00:05:01.169> 10<00:05:01.440> to<00:05:01.530> the<00:05:01.620> power<00:05:01.800> of<00:05:01.860> 2<00:05:02.160> put

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:02.880 
powers that's 10 to the power of 2 put

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:05.780 
powers that's 10 to the power of 2 put
that<00:05:03.030> time<00:05:03.240> sign<00:05:03.540> in<00:05:03.720> left<00:05:04.650> my<00:05:04.830> answer<00:05:05.250> just

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:05.790 
that time sign in left my answer just

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:09.260 
that time sign in left my answer just
check<00:05:06.090> that<00:05:06.870> is<00:05:07.290> between<00:05:08.130> 1<00:05:08.340> and<00:05:08.520> 10<00:05:08.729> and<00:05:08.970> it<00:05:09.090> is

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:09.270 
check that is between 1 and 10 and it is

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:11.180 
check that is between 1 and 10 and it is
so<00:05:09.900> there's<00:05:10.110> my<00:05:10.229> out<00:05:10.410> sort<00:05:10.680> of<00:05:10.740> that<00:05:10.919> question

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:11.190 
so there's my out sort of that question

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:15.650 
so there's my out sort of that question

special<00:05:29.370> standard<00:05:29.880> form<00:05:30.180> tricks<00:05:30.570> if<00:05:31.050> you're

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:31.590 
special standard form tricks if you're

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:33.830 
special standard form tricks if you're
adding<00:05:31.950> or<00:05:32.130> if<00:05:32.220> you're<00:05:32.340> taking<00:05:32.669> away<00:05:32.789> the<00:05:33.720> only

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:33.840 
adding or if you're taking away the only

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:35.820 
way to do this really is to write both

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:38.170 
way to do this really is to write both

00:05:42.170 --> 00:05:42.180 
that 8 times 10 to the power of 5 is 8

10 to the power of 3 is 2 with 3 zeroes
after<00:05:51.240> it<00:05:52.250> so<00:05:53.250> I've<00:05:53.550> got<00:05:54.110> so<00:05:55.110> I<00:05:55.139> should<00:05:55.380> have

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:55.470 
after it so I've got so I should have

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:57.379 
after it so I've got so I should have
had<00:05:55.590> five<00:05:55.830> zero<00:05:56.160> seven<00:05:56.370> I<00:05:56.580> got<00:05:56.729> four<00:05:57.000> so<00:05:57.180> I<00:05:57.210> put

00:05:57.379 --> 00:05:57.389 
had five zero seven I got four so I put

00:05:57.389 --> 00:06:00.650 
had five zero seven I got four so I put
another<00:05:57.419> one<00:05:57.630> in<00:05:57.919> so<00:05:58.919> I've<00:05:59.010> got<00:05:59.160> 800<00:06:00.120> thousand

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:00.660 
another one in so I've got 800 thousand

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:03.350 
another one in so I've got 800 thousand
and<00:06:01.100> two<00:06:02.100> thousand<00:06:02.669> and<00:06:02.789> if<00:06:02.940> I<00:06:03.000> add<00:06:03.150> those

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:03.360 
and two thousand and if I add those

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:06.010 
and two thousand and if I add those
together<00:06:03.539> I<00:06:03.960> get<00:06:04.410> eight<00:06:04.710> hundred<00:06:05.100> and<00:06:05.130> two

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:06.020 
together I get eight hundred and two

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:09.830 
together I get eight hundred and two
thousand<00:06:07.520> then<00:06:08.520> I<00:06:08.789> can<00:06:09.210> change<00:06:09.389> that<00:06:09.600> back

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:09.840 
thousand then I can change that back

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:12.790 
thousand then I can change that back
into<00:06:10.110> a<00:06:10.139> standard<00:06:10.530> form<00:06:10.800> number<00:06:11.010> I<00:06:11.389> will<00:06:12.389> write

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:12.800 
into a standard form number I will write
