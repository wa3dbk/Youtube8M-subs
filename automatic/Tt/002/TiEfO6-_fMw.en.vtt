00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
tall cooling fan but I actually had to

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.000 
tall cooling fan but I actually had to
do<00:01:52.360> some<00:01:52.540> modifications<00:01:52.870> to<00:01:53.380> get<00:01:53.560> back<00:01:53.740> to<00:01:53.860> fit

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:54.010 
do some modifications to get back to fit

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:57.550 
had to modify on the case in order to

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:59.580 
had to modify on the case in order to
get<00:01:57.730> a<00:01:57.760> tall<00:01:58.060> cooler<00:01:58.480> i<00:01:58.510> wanted<00:01:58.840> a<00:01:58.930> tall<00:01:59.170> and

get a tall cooler i wanted a tall and
really<00:01:59.770> quiet<00:02:00.130> cooler<00:02:00.580> the<00:02:00.790> stockrooms<00:02:01.450> not

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:01.690 
really quiet cooler the stockrooms not

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:03.720 
really quiet cooler the stockrooms not
quiet<00:02:01.990> enough<00:02:02.230> so<00:02:02.920> i<00:02:02.980> wanted<00:02:03.280> something<00:02:03.700> that

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:03.730 
quiet enough so i wanted something that

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:06.360 
quiet enough so i wanted something that
was<00:02:04.000> basically<00:02:04.240> inaudible<00:02:04.870> when<00:02:05.740> like<00:02:06.160> we're

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:06.370 
was basically inaudible when like we're

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:08.730 
was basically inaudible when like we're
watching<00:02:06.670> movies<00:02:06.970> and<00:02:07.150> stuff<00:02:07.330> so<00:02:08.229> this<00:02:08.530> is<00:02:08.560> a

00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:08.740 
watching movies and stuff so this is a

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:10.919 
watching movies and stuff so this is a
set<00:02:09.010> up<00:02:09.040> all<00:02:09.369> the<00:02:09.610> case<00:02:09.790> also<00:02:10.000> came<00:02:10.300> with<00:02:10.330> a<00:02:10.479> 500

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:10.929 
set up all the case also came with a 500

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:13.530 
set up all the case also came with a 500
watt<00:02:11.020> power<00:02:11.230> supply<00:02:11.370> it<00:02:12.370> only<00:02:12.520> has<00:02:12.700> 16<00:02:13.180> pin

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
watt power supply it only has 16 pin

watt power supply it only has 16 pin
power<00:02:13.720> connector<00:02:13.870> but<00:02:14.740> that's<00:02:14.920> going<00:02:15.100> to<00:02:15.160> work

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
power connector but that's going to work

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:16.740 
power connector but that's going to work
out<00:02:15.490> perfectly<00:02:15.880> with<00:02:16.090> the<00:02:16.180> new<00:02:16.300> video<00:02:16.540> card

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:16.750 
out perfectly with the new video card

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:18.840 
out perfectly with the new video card
that<00:02:16.930> I<00:02:16.990> have<00:02:17.170> been<00:02:17.380> playing<00:02:17.500> installing<00:02:18.190> it

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
that I have been playing installing it

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.960 
that I have been playing installing it
only<00:02:19.000> requires<00:02:19.330> one<00:02:20.160> 6-pin<00:02:21.160> connector<00:02:21.310> and

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
only requires one 6-pin connector and

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.150 
only requires one 6-pin connector and
only<00:02:22.240> draws<00:02:22.480> 100<00:02:23.200> watts<00:02:23.410> of<00:02:23.590> power<00:02:23.709> there's<00:02:24.130> a

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
only draws 100 watts of power there's a

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.680 
only draws 100 watts of power there's a
quick<00:02:24.310> look<00:02:24.459> at<00:02:24.580> the<00:02:24.610> other<00:02:24.790> other<00:02:25.120> side<00:02:25.450> guys

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:25.690 
quick look at the other other side guys

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:27.000 
quick look at the other other side guys
you<00:02:25.990> can<00:02:26.140> see<00:02:26.320> that<00:02:26.500> we<00:02:26.590> got<00:02:26.709> pretty

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:27.010 
you can see that we got pretty

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.220 
you can see that we got pretty
substantial<00:02:27.940> room<00:02:28.150> for<00:02:28.390> long<00:02:28.540> video<00:02:28.840> cards

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
substantial room for long video cards

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.710 
substantial room for long video cards
the<00:02:29.410> main<00:02:29.620> problem<00:02:30.580> obviously<00:02:30.850> is<00:02:31.300> the<00:02:31.510> height

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:31.720 
the main problem obviously is the height

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:33.960 
the main problem obviously is the height
you<00:02:32.290> got<00:02:32.410> to<00:02:32.530> make<00:02:32.620> sure<00:02:32.650> they're<00:02:33.040> not<00:02:33.190> too

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:33.970 
you got to make sure they're not too

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:36.660 
you got to make sure they're not too
high<00:02:34.209> or<00:02:34.600> have<00:02:34.720> too<00:02:34.930> much<00:02:35.050> heat<00:02:35.350> pipes<00:02:35.670> that

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:36.670 
high or have too much heat pipes that

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:41.100 
high or have too much heat pipes that
come<00:02:36.910> up<00:02:37.060> that<00:02:37.090> might<00:02:37.270> hit<00:02:37.630> the<00:02:39.690> power<00:02:40.690> supply

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:41.110 
come up that might hit the power supply

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:42.900 
come up that might hit the power supply
here<00:02:41.380> and<00:02:41.709> you<00:02:42.130> have<00:02:42.220> to<00:02:42.310> make<00:02:42.370> sure<00:02:42.580> that<00:02:42.760> they

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:42.910 
here and you have to make sure that they

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:44.699 
here and you have to make sure that they
have<00:02:43.030> horizontal<00:02:43.420> facing<00:02:44.019> power<00:02:44.230> connectors

00:02:44.699 --> 00:02:44.709 
have horizontal facing power connectors

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:45.720 
have horizontal facing power connectors
otherwise<00:02:45.100> you're<00:02:45.250> gonna<00:02:45.310> have<00:02:45.459> to<00:02:45.550> mod<00:02:45.700> your

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
otherwise you're gonna have to mod your

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.820 
otherwise you're gonna have to mod your
case<00:02:46.090> because<00:02:46.510> the<00:02:46.630> power<00:02:46.810> connector<00:02:47.260> is

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:47.830 
case because the power connector is

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:49.259 
case because the power connector is
going<00:02:48.010> to<00:02:48.070> hit<00:02:48.190> this<00:02:48.340> drive<00:02:48.640> bay<00:02:48.850> right<00:02:49.030> here

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:49.269

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:29.330 
a millimeter fan on the other side here
but<00:03:27.780> as<00:03:27.900> you<00:03:28.050> can<00:03:28.170> see<00:03:28.410> right<00:03:28.440> here<00:03:28.920> and<00:03:29.160> here

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
but as you can see right here and here

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.610 
but as you can see right here and here
had<00:03:29.520> cut<00:03:29.790> the<00:03:29.820> case<00:03:30.090> with<00:03:30.300> the<00:03:30.390> dremel<00:03:30.780> to<00:03:31.470> get

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
had cut the case with the dremel to get

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.880 
had cut the case with the dremel to get
it<00:03:31.740> to<00:03:31.860> fit<00:03:32.100> because<00:03:32.670> it<00:03:32.820> was<00:03:33.350> making<00:03:34.350> contact

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:34.890 
it to fit because it was making contact

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:36.890 
it to fit because it was making contact
here<00:03:35.220> but<00:03:35.400> we<00:03:35.490> did<00:03:35.670> get<00:03:35.820> it<00:03:35.940> to<00:03:36.030> fit<00:03:36.240> and<00:03:36.600> work

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
here but we did get it to fit and work

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:39.770 
here but we did get it to fit and work
around<00:03:37.080> the<00:03:37.260> power<00:03:37.410> supply<00:03:37.740> on<00:03:38.210> this<00:03:39.210> cooler

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
around the power supply on this cooler

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.810 
around the power supply on this cooler
has<00:03:39.960> a<00:03:40.020> fan<00:03:40.860> that<00:03:41.010> you<00:03:41.100> can<00:03:41.220> offset<00:03:41.460> on<00:03:41.790> the

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:41.820 
has a fan that you can offset on the

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:43.910 
has a fan that you can offset on the
other<00:03:42.030> side<00:03:42.240> so<00:03:42.450> it<00:03:42.540> is<00:03:42.690> slightly<00:03:43.110> down<00:03:43.560> lower

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
other side so it is slightly down lower

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:46.070 
other side so it is slightly down lower
because<00:03:44.910> of<00:03:45.060> the<00:03:45.150> power<00:03:45.300> supply<00:03:45.540> that<00:03:45.690> comes

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:46.080 
because of the power supply that comes

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.440 
because of the power supply that comes
in<00:03:46.260> here<00:03:46.410> too<00:03:46.620> so<00:03:47.100> this<00:03:47.400> is<00:03:47.430> a<00:03:47.700> cooler<00:03:48.270> that

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:48.450 
in here too so this is a cooler that

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:52.730 
in here too so this is a cooler that
 that<00:03:49.200> good<00:03:51.290> trying<00:03:52.290> to<00:03:52.320> show<00:03:52.410> you<00:03:52.530> from

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:52.740 
 that good trying to show you from

00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:55.340 
 that good trying to show you from
this<00:03:52.920> angle<00:03:53.160> it<00:03:53.520> is<00:03:54.420> pretty<00:03:54.720> tight<00:03:54.990> in<00:03:55.020> there

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:55.350 
this angle it is pretty tight in there

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:57.190 
this angle it is pretty tight in there
if<00:03:55.470> you<00:03:55.560> can<00:03:55.590> see<00:03:55.710> that's<00:03:56.220> right<00:03:56.520> up<00:03:56.700> on<00:03:56.910> the

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 
if you can see that's right up on the

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:00.680 
if you can see that's right up on the
hard<00:03:58.200> drive<00:03:58.350> chassis<00:03:58.850> and<00:03:59.850> then<00:04:00.120> there<00:04:00.450> is

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:00.690 
hard drive chassis and then there is

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:04.100 
hard drive chassis and then there is
where<00:04:00.990> the<00:04:01.140> cooling<00:04:01.500> fan<00:04:01.530> comes<00:04:02.190> in<00:04:02.520> on<00:04:03.110> a

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.110 
where the cooling fan comes in on a

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:08.240 
where the cooling fan comes in on a
slight<00:04:04.590> a<00:04:04.800> leap<00:04:05.160> in<00:04:05.340> see<00:04:05.550> for<00:04:05.790> the<00:04:06.950> the<00:04:07.950> cooling

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
slight a leap in see for the the cooling

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:09.920 
slight a leap in see for the the cooling
fan<00:04:08.280> is<00:04:08.580> on<00:04:08.670> an<00:04:08.790> offset<00:04:09.210> angle<00:04:09.600> from<00:04:09.840> the

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:09.930 
fan is on an offset angle from the

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:11.250 
fan is on an offset angle from the
corner<00:04:10.290> of<00:04:10.380> a<00:04:10.470> polished

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:11.260 
corner of a polished

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:13.670 
corner of a polished
but<00:04:11.860> it<00:04:11.950> does<00:04:12.129> fit<00:04:12.549> and<00:04:12.790> it<00:04:12.909> cools<00:04:13.090> grey

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
but it does fit and it cools grey

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.439 
but it does fit and it cools grey
totally<00:04:14.680> inaudible<00:04:14.860> it<00:04:15.700> can't<00:04:15.970> be<00:04:16.030> heard<00:04:16.299> when

00:04:16.439 --> 00:04:16.449 
totally inaudible it can't be heard when

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:18.030 
totally inaudible it can't be heard when
you're<00:04:16.600> watching<00:04:16.720> movies<00:04:17.199> so<00:04:17.410> that's<00:04:17.680> that's

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:18.040 
you're watching movies so that's that's

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.069 
you're watching movies so that's that's
the<00:04:18.340> overall<00:04:18.669> main<00:04:19.060> goal<00:04:19.269> so<00:04:19.570> with<00:04:19.840> a<00:04:19.870> slight

00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:20.079 
the overall main goal so with a slight

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:21.930 
the overall main goal so with a slight
modification<00:04:20.709> you<00:04:20.889> can<00:04:21.100> fit<00:04:21.310> this<00:04:21.430> cooler<00:04:21.790> in

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:21.940 
modification you can fit this cooler in

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:24.570 
modification you can fit this cooler in
here<00:04:22.590> see<00:04:23.590> I<00:04:23.620> went<00:04:23.889> ahead<00:04:23.949> and<00:04:24.070> removed<00:04:24.280> the

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:24.580 
here see I went ahead and removed the

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:26.100 
here see I went ahead and removed the
motherboard<00:04:25.090> tray<00:04:25.330> and<00:04:25.570> disconnected

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:26.110

everything<00:04:26.560> unfortunately<00:04:27.250> the<00:04:27.340> cooler<00:04:27.639> is

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:27.760 
everything unfortunately the cooler is

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:30.629 
everything unfortunately the cooler is
so<00:04:27.970> tall<00:04:28.210> that<00:04:28.419> you<00:04:28.600> cannot<00:04:28.870> remove<00:04:29.639> the

00:04:30.629 --> 00:04:30.639 
so tall that you cannot remove the

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:33.029 
so tall that you cannot remove the
motherboard<00:04:31.150> without<00:04:31.539> removing<00:04:32.050> a<00:04:32.199> taller

00:04:33.029 --> 00:04:33.039 
motherboard without removing a taller

cooler<00:04:33.490> if<00:04:33.639> you<00:04:33.760> have<00:04:33.940> a<00:04:33.970> dog<00:04:35.280> has<00:04:36.280> a<00:04:36.310> pretty

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:36.610 
cooler if you have a dog has a pretty

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:38.790 
cooler if you have a dog has a pretty
low<00:04:36.850> clearance<00:04:37.330> so<00:04:38.110> we'll<00:04:38.260> just<00:04:38.470> go<00:04:38.590> ahead<00:04:38.680> and

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:38.800 
low clearance so we'll just go ahead and

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.890 
low clearance so we'll just go ahead and

like<00:05:54.510> I<00:05:54.660> think<00:05:54.900> it<00:05:55.020> well<00:05:55.200> so<00:05:55.650> we'll<00:05:55.950> find<00:05:56.160> out

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:56.430 
like I think it well so we'll find out

00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:00.940 
like I think it well so we'll find out
looks<00:05:57.390> like<00:05:57.540> it'll<00:05:57.720> be<00:05:57.840> a<00:05:57.870> tight<00:05:58.110> fit

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:00.950 

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:07.040 

oh<00:06:01.040> man<00:06:01.910> that<00:06:02.300> just<00:06:02.630> barely<00:06:02.990> clears

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:07.050 

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:18.700 

look<00:06:07.650> at<00:06:07.770> that<00:06:07.909> perfect

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:18.710 

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:22.900 

and<00:06:19.130> there<00:06:19.400> we<00:06:19.610> go<00:06:20.680> upgraded<00:06:21.680> video<00:06:21.980> card<00:06:22.340> and

00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:22.910 
and there we go upgraded video card and

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:24.520 
and there we go upgraded video card and
there<00:06:23.240> you<00:06:23.300> guys<00:06:23.450> go<00:06:23.510> now<00:06:23.900> you<00:06:23.960> can<00:06:24.170> see<00:06:24.320> that

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:24.530 
there you guys go now you can see that

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:27.340 
there you guys go now you can see that
this<00:06:24.710> case<00:06:25.130> can't<00:06:25.520> handle<00:06:25.790> a<00:06:25.910> larger<00:06:26.390> video

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:27.350 
this case can't handle a larger video

00:06:27.350 --> 00:06:29.650 
this case can't handle a larger video

see<00:06:32.390> I<00:06:32.630> picked<00:06:33.470> this<00:06:33.620> card<00:06:33.890> because<00:06:34.220> the<00:06:34.490> power

00:06:34.660 --> 00:06:34.670 
see I picked this card because the power

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:36.370 
see I picked this card because the power
connectors<00:06:35.150> in<00:06:35.360> the<00:06:35.450> back<00:06:35.630> here<00:06:35.930> coming<00:06:36.260> out

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:36.380 
connectors in the back here coming out

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:38.650 
connectors in the back here coming out
the<00:06:36.530> rear<00:06:36.770> if<00:06:37.400> you<00:06:37.670> have<00:06:37.820> a<00:06:37.850> vertical<00:06:38.120> one<00:06:38.480> your

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:38.660 
the rear if you have a vertical one your

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:39.880 
the rear if you have a vertical one your
power<00:06:38.840> connectors<00:06:39.290> are<00:06:39.410> going<00:06:39.530> to<00:06:39.590> hit<00:06:39.740> right

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:39.890 
power connectors are going to hit right

00:06:39.890 --> 00:06:41.590 
power connectors are going to hit right
here<00:06:39.950> you<00:06:40.220> could<00:06:40.400> modify<00:06:40.700> this<00:06:40.850> case<00:06:41.240> and<00:06:41.450> cut

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:41.600 
here you could modify this case and cut

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:43.600 
here you could modify this case and cut
that<00:06:41.810> but<00:06:42.170> I<00:06:42.440> really<00:06:43.010> didn't<00:06:43.220> want<00:06:43.370> to<00:06:43.400> have<00:06:43.490> to

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:43.610 
that but I really didn't want to have to

00:06:43.610 --> 00:06:46.000 
that but I really didn't want to have to
so<00:06:44.420> we<00:06:44.570> lucked<00:06:44.780> out<00:06:44.960> this<00:06:45.020> thing<00:06:45.500> fits<00:06:45.770> like

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:46.010 
so we lucked out this thing fits like

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:48.220 
so we lucked out this thing fits like
perfectly<00:06:46.580> in<00:06:46.820> here<00:06:47.180> it's<00:06:47.840> going<00:06:47.990> to<00:06:48.080> have<00:06:48.200> a

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:48.230 
perfectly in here it's going to have a

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:50.260 
perfectly in here it's going to have a
quiet<00:06:48.620> noise<00:06:48.920> because<00:06:49.400> of<00:06:49.580> the<00:06:49.670> dual<00:06:49.820> cooling

00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:50.270 
quiet noise because of the dual cooling

00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:52.300 
quiet noise because of the dual cooling
solution<00:06:50.810> so<00:06:51.560> it's<00:06:51.680> not<00:06:51.860> going<00:06:51.950> to<00:06:52.040> be<00:06:52.130> loud

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:52.310 
solution so it's not going to be loud

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:53.710 
solution so it's not going to be loud
it's<00:06:52.610> going<00:06:52.730> to<00:06:52.790> offer<00:06:52.910> some<00:06:53.450> great

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:53.720 
it's going to offer some great

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:58.120 
it's going to offer some great
performance<00:06:54.350> and<00:06:54.850> and<00:06:55.900> cooling<00:06:56.900> for<00:06:57.530> the<00:06:57.620> htpc

00:06:58.120 --> 00:06:58.130 
performance and and cooling for the htpc

00:06:58.130 --> 00:06:59.860 
performance and and cooling for the htpc
set<00:06:58.520> up<00:06:58.670> we'll<00:06:59.150> go<00:06:59.180> ahead<00:06:59.300> and<00:06:59.510> get<00:06:59.570> all<00:06:59.750> the

00:06:59.860 --> 00:06:59.870 
set up we'll go ahead and get all the

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:01.050 
set up we'll go ahead and get all the
wires<00:07:00.050> and<00:07:00.290> everything<00:07:00.320> hooked<00:07:00.680> back<00:07:00.830> up

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:01.060 
wires and everything hooked back up

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:03.490 
wires and everything hooked back up
quick<00:07:02.060> look<00:07:02.300> at<00:07:02.420> what<00:07:02.450> kind<00:07:02.870> of<00:07:02.960> clearance<00:07:03.200> we

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:03.500 
quick look at what kind of clearance we

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:04.960 
quick look at what kind of clearance we
got<00:07:03.650> here<00:07:03.860> I<00:07:03.890> did<00:07:04.130> have<00:07:04.310> to<00:07:04.460> remove<00:07:04.640> the<00:07:04.850> power

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:04.970

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:11.260 
supply from the top to insert the card
here<00:07:08.620> but<00:07:09.620> you<00:07:09.800> can<00:07:09.860> see<00:07:10.190> that<00:07:10.220> at<00:07:10.580> all<00:07:10.670> it<00:07:11.000> does
