00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:13.280 
now on the end outside if we want to

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.110 
now on the end outside if we want to
remove<00:01:13.550> the<00:01:14.510> high<00:01:14.630> limits<00:01:15.760> pressure<00:01:16.760> switch

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:22.790 
wires and the sensor careful not to lose

00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:25.330 
wires and the sensor careful not to lose
this<00:01:22.940> part<00:01:23.690> of<00:01:23.750> the<00:01:23.840> sensor<00:01:24.260> now<00:01:24.799> we<00:01:24.860> can<00:01:25.159> take

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:25.340 
this part of the sensor now we can take

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.340 
this part of the sensor now we can take
these<00:01:25.520> nuts<00:01:25.790> off<00:01:26.000> around<00:01:26.840> the<00:01:26.990> perimeter<00:01:27.320> of

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:27.350 
these nuts off around the perimeter of

these nuts off around the perimeter of
the<00:01:27.470> in<00:01:27.650> out<00:01:27.770> header<00:01:29.440> now<00:01:30.440> this<00:01:30.620> will<00:01:30.770> just

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:30.950 
the in out header now this will just

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:35.440 
the in out header now this will just
simply<00:01:31.580> move<00:01:31.940> off<00:01:32.150> if<00:01:32.750> you'll<00:01:33.350> notice<00:01:34.450> these

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450 
simply move off if you'll notice these

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.950 
simply move off if you'll notice these
bolt<00:01:35.780> configurations<00:01:36.560> are<00:01:36.710> identical<00:01:37.780> so<00:01:38.780> now

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:38.960 
bolt configurations are identical so now

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.510 
bolt configurations are identical so now
we<00:01:39.020> can<00:01:39.229> just<00:01:39.260> reverse<00:01:39.740> the<00:01:39.950> headers<00:01:42.460> okay<00:01:43.460> if

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:43.520 
we can just reverse the headers okay if

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:44.710 
we can just reverse the headers okay if
you<00:01:43.610> notice<00:01:43.940> now<00:01:44.090> that<00:01:44.119> we've<00:01:44.420> got<00:01:44.540> this

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:44.720 
you notice now that we've got this

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.200 
you notice now that we've got this

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:49.549 
our limits or our sensor so we're going

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:51.460 
our limits or our sensor so we're going
to<00:01:49.640> have<00:01:49.729> to<00:01:49.790> relocate<00:01:50.030> those<00:01:50.390> we'll<00:01:51.229> pull

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 
to have to relocate those we'll pull

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.859 
to have to relocate those we'll pull
these<00:01:51.590> wires<00:01:51.830> straight<00:01:52.369> out<00:01:52.580> and<00:01:53.000> we're<00:01:53.780> going

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:53.869 
these wires straight out and we're going

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:55.149

00:01:55.159 --> 00:01:57.760 
to have to relocate these to the other
side<00:01:55.460> once<00:01:56.210> we<00:01:56.330> get<00:01:56.540> the<00:01:56.780> header<00:01:57.260> over<00:01:57.590> there

this<00:02:05.990> was<00:02:06.170> a<00:02:06.200> return<00:02:06.530> header<00:02:06.740> side<00:02:08.200> okay<00:02:09.200> when

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:09.319 
this was a return header side okay when

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:11.500 
this was a return header side okay when
you<00:02:09.409> put<00:02:09.560> these<00:02:09.679> back<00:02:09.890> in<00:02:09.969> be<00:02:10.969> sure<00:02:11.180> to<00:02:11.329> put<00:02:11.480> a

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
you put these back in be sure to put a

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.690 
you put these back in be sure to put a
light<00:02:11.749> clutch<00:02:12.019> on<00:02:12.260> your<00:02:12.409> drill<00:02:12.650> and<00:02:12.829> go<00:02:13.370> solo

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:13.700 
light clutch on your drill and go solo

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.500 
light clutch on your drill and go solo
it's<00:02:14.540> easy<00:02:14.900> enough<00:02:15.139> to<00:02:15.319> break

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
it's easy enough to break

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:20.429 
it's easy enough to break
a<00:02:16.569> quarter-inch<00:02:17.260> bolt<00:02:18.810> okay<00:02:19.810> we<00:02:19.959> brought<00:02:20.260> the

00:02:20.429 --> 00:02:20.439 
a quarter-inch bolt okay we brought the

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:21.750 
a quarter-inch bolt okay we brought the
wires<00:02:20.650> through<00:02:21.040> we<00:02:21.400> brought<00:02:21.610> them<00:02:21.700> through

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
wires through we brought them through

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.360 
wires through we brought them through
the<00:02:21.909> heat<00:02:22.150> shield<00:02:22.530> the<00:02:23.530> high-limit<00:02:24.010> shield

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:24.370 
the heat shield the high-limit shield

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.759 
the heat shield the high-limit shield
here<00:02:24.670> so<00:02:25.540> now<00:02:25.689> let's<00:02:25.900> go<00:02:26.079> ahead<00:02:26.170> and<00:02:26.470> put<00:02:26.620> the

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:26.769 
here so now let's go ahead and put the

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:31.229 
here so now let's go ahead and put the
limits<00:02:27.220> on<00:02:27.930> hi<00:02:28.930> little<00:02:29.110> bit<00:02:29.200> one<00:02:29.470> I<00:02:30.000> limit<00:02:31.000> to

00:02:31.229 --> 00:02:31.239 
limits on hi little bit one I limit to

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:34.890 
limits on hi little bit one I limit to
the<00:02:31.870> pressure<00:02:32.200> switch<00:02:33.239> now<00:02:34.239> those<00:02:34.450> wires<00:02:34.720> are

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:34.900 
the pressure switch now those wires are

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.600 
the pressure switch now those wires are
armed<00:02:35.079> we<00:02:35.200> can<00:02:35.349> put<00:02:35.530> this<00:02:35.680> shield<00:02:36.129> in<00:02:36.400> place

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:43.470 

and<00:02:39.610> put<00:02:40.060> this<00:02:40.180> nut<00:02:40.390> over<00:02:40.510> to<00:02:40.750> hold<00:02:40.900> it<00:02:41.019> in<00:02:42.480> last

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480 
and put this nut over to hold it in last

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.960 
and put this nut over to hold it in last
thing<00:02:43.690> we<00:02:43.810> have<00:02:43.930> to<00:02:43.989> do<00:02:44.200> is<00:02:44.489> our<00:02:45.489> three<00:02:45.790> wires

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:45.970 
thing we have to do is our three wires

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:48.930 
thing we have to do is our three wires
sensor<00:02:47.040> take<00:02:48.040> that<00:02:48.220> good<00:02:48.430> and<00:02:48.549> tight<00:02:48.730> and

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:48.940 
sensor take that good and tight and

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.579 
sensor take that good and tight and
you're<00:02:49.390> ready<00:02:49.659> for<00:02:50.650> reverse<00:02:50.920> flow<00:02:51.250> of<00:02:51.370> water
