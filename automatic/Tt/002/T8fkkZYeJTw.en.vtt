00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:13.590
 I converted everything myself to black 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.570
 So there's display better me 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:18.820

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:22.420
 so let's start it now 

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:29.410
 so after it starts we catch 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:32.020
 on the first page so all pretty 

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:35.129

00:00:43.839 --> 00:00:49.420
 i have the standard apple app store 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:51.219
 rarely do I need it because I have it 

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:54.010
 despite app facetime and facebook 

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:58.030
 added windows is also economist 

00:00:54.010 --> 00:01:00.039
 was only on the second page so here 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.590
 is all the same to me and remained 

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:06.009
 I put my iphone down in front of me 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:07.420

 navigation app institute is such an app 

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:16.360

00:01:21.910 --> 00:01:35.250
 For example, here we take the song 

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:37.750

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:41.530

 Such folders make really great app 

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:58.590
