liquitex line and that's really

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.089 
liquitex line and that's really
versatility<00:00:09.540> now<00:00:10.139> because<00:00:10.410> it's<00:00:10.590> an<00:00:10.709> acrylic

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
versatility now because it's an acrylic

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:12.949 
versatility now because it's an acrylic
ink<00:00:11.519> it<00:00:11.999> can<00:00:12.179> be<00:00:12.269> mixed<00:00:12.570> with<00:00:12.719> the<00:00:12.780> other

00:00:12.949 --> 00:00:12.959 
ink it can be mixed with the other

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:14.629 
ink it can be mixed with the other
mediums<00:00:13.440> and<00:00:13.559> the<00:00:13.650> other<00:00:13.799> two<00:00:14.009> colors<00:00:14.309> in<00:00:14.610> the

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:14.639 
mediums and the other two colors in the

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:16.880 
mediums and the other two colors in the
line<00:00:14.849> and<00:00:15.209> that's<00:00:16.020> different<00:00:16.350> than<00:00:16.560> what<00:00:16.770> you

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:16.890 
line and that's different than what you

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:18.680 
line and that's different than what you
normally<00:00:17.039> think<00:00:17.280> of<00:00:17.640> when<00:00:17.820> you<00:00:18.030> think<00:00:18.060> of<00:00:18.300> inks

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
normally think of when you think of inks

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.840 
normally think of when you think of inks
usually<00:00:19.320> it's<00:00:19.440> a<00:00:19.530> dye<00:00:19.770> in<00:00:20.100> a<00:00:20.190> shellac<00:00:20.550> base

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:20.850 
usually it's a dye in a shellac base

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.270 
usually it's a dye in a shellac base
because<00:00:21.570> this<00:00:21.780> is<00:00:21.930> an<00:00:22.020> acrylic<00:00:22.230> again<00:00:23.040> it<00:00:23.160> can

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:23.280 
because this is an acrylic again it can

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:24.860 
because this is an acrylic again it can
be<00:00:23.310> inter<00:00:23.580> mixable<00:00:23.970> with<00:00:24.240> all<00:00:24.480> the<00:00:24.630> other<00:00:24.750> low

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:24.870 
be inter mixable with all the other low

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:27.110 
be inter mixable with all the other low
context<00:00:25.170> products<00:00:25.710> and<00:00:25.860> there's<00:00:26.430> 30<00:00:26.700> colors

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:27.120 
context products and there's 30 colors

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:29.300 
context products and there's 30 colors
in<00:00:27.330> the<00:00:27.480> range<00:00:27.720> and<00:00:28.020> they<00:00:28.350> match<00:00:28.710> with<00:00:29.160> the

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
in the range and they match with the

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:30.650 
in the range and they match with the
other<00:00:29.460> colors<00:00:29.850> so<00:00:29.970> that's<00:00:30.090> nice<00:00:30.330> to<00:00:30.480> have<00:00:30.570> an

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660 
other colors so that's nice to have an

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:32.930 
other colors so that's nice to have an
exact<00:00:30.990> match<00:00:31.230> so<00:00:31.530> if<00:00:31.620> I<00:00:31.710> have<00:00:31.950> let's<00:00:32.460> say<00:00:32.610> vivid

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
exact match so if I have let's say vivid

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.090 
exact match so if I have let's say vivid
lime<00:00:33.120> green<00:00:33.480> in<00:00:33.719> a<00:00:33.809> two<00:00:33.989> color<00:00:34.289> and<00:00:34.620> vivid<00:00:34.920> lime

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
lime green in a two color and vivid lime

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.130 
lime green in a two color and vivid lime
green<00:00:35.430> and<00:00:35.730> an<00:00:35.820> ink<00:00:36.060> again<00:00:36.690> those<00:00:36.900> are<00:00:36.930> going

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
green and an ink again those are going

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.200 
green and an ink again those are going
to<00:00:37.200> match<00:00:37.410> their<00:00:37.680> intermix<00:00:38.070> will<00:00:38.280> same<00:00:38.850> color

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
to match their intermix will same color

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:41.360 
to match their intermix will same color
they're<00:00:39.960> water-based<00:00:40.560> there<00:00:41.010> are<00:00:41.100> permanent

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
they're water-based there are permanent

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:43.370 
they're water-based there are permanent
inks<00:00:41.910> and<00:00:42.030> again<00:00:42.360> they're<00:00:42.510> very<00:00:42.540> very<00:00:42.960> fluid

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:43.380 
inks and again they're very very fluid

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:45.979 
inks and again they're very very fluid
so<00:00:44.100> that<00:00:44.550> allows<00:00:44.820> me<00:00:45.060> to<00:00:45.210> do<00:00:45.300> a<00:00:45.329> lot<00:00:45.660> of<00:00:45.780> things

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
so that allows me to do a lot of things

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.900 
so that allows me to do a lot of things
that<00:00:46.110> I<00:00:46.140> would<00:00:46.320> normally<00:00:46.500> do<00:00:46.890> with<00:00:47.190> other<00:00:47.489> inks

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
that I would normally do with other inks

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.630 
that I would normally do with other inks
again<00:00:48.149> a<00:00:48.300> dye<00:00:48.600> in<00:00:48.930> a<00:00:49.140> shellac<00:00:49.470> base<00:00:49.770> but<00:00:50.430> this

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
again a dye in a shellac base but this

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.340 
again a dye in a shellac base but this
is<00:00:50.820> better<00:00:51.060> because<00:00:51.200> since<00:00:52.200> we're<00:00:52.320> using

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
is better because since we're using

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.950 
is better because since we're using
highly<00:00:52.980> pigmented<00:00:53.370> acrylic<00:00:54.149> rather<00:00:54.660> than<00:00:54.899> a

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
highly pigmented acrylic rather than a

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.500 
highly pigmented acrylic rather than a
dye<00:00:55.170> we've<00:00:55.860> got<00:00:56.040> light<00:00:56.280> fastness<00:00:56.760> we've<00:00:57.149> got<00:00:57.329> a

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
dye we've got light fastness we've got a

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.020 
dye we've got light fastness we've got a
permanent<00:00:58.110> ink<00:00:58.320> dyes<00:00:58.890> can<00:00:59.190> fade<00:00:59.489> over<00:00:59.760> time

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
permanent ink dyes can fade over time

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.340 
permanent ink dyes can fade over time
and<00:01:00.540> that's<00:01:00.719> something<00:01:01.079> that<00:01:01.200> you<00:01:01.320> really

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
and that's something that you really

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:02.959 
and that's something that you really
don't<00:01:01.559> want<00:01:02.010> for<00:01:02.130> the<00:01:02.190> longevity<00:01:02.399> of<00:01:02.820> your

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
don't want for the longevity of your

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:06.680 
don't want for the longevity of your
work<00:01:03.390> so<00:01:04.019> again<00:01:04.860> these<00:01:05.460> colors<00:01:05.790> can<00:01:06.420> be<00:01:06.509> mixed

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:06.690 
work so again these colors can be mixed

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:09.050 
work so again these colors can be mixed
with<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:07.470> mediums<00:01:07.860> that<00:01:07.950> we<00:01:08.159> have<00:01:08.370> and<00:01:08.640> also

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
with the mediums that we have and also

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.210 
with the mediums that we have and also
the<00:01:09.299> two<00:01:09.450> colors<00:01:09.840> as<00:01:10.020> well<00:01:10.170> again<00:01:10.799> to<00:01:10.920> add<00:01:11.040> to

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
the two colors as well again to add to

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.649 
the two colors as well again to add to
versatility<00:01:11.820> throughout<00:01:12.330> your<00:01:12.479> whole

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:12.659 
versatility throughout your whole

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:15.590 
versatility throughout your whole

practice in your studio so all of the
things<00:01:15.810> that<00:01:15.930> I<00:01:16.049> can<00:01:16.290> do<00:01:16.470> with<00:01:16.650> the

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
things that I can do with the

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.050 
things that I can do with the
traditional<00:01:16.890> ink<00:01:17.430> can<00:01:17.640> be<00:01:17.729> done<00:01:17.880> with<00:01:18.000> the

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
put out a lot more ink right here I'm

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:04.969 
put out a lot more ink right here I'm
gonna<00:02:03.570> sort<00:02:03.780> of<00:02:03.840> flood<00:02:04.110> this<00:02:04.259> area<00:02:04.500> for<00:02:04.920> a

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
gonna sort of flood this area for a

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.219 
gonna sort of flood this area for a
second<00:02:05.430> and<00:02:05.880> the<00:02:06.000> reason<00:02:06.150> I'm<00:02:06.390> doing<00:02:06.420> that<00:02:06.750> too

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
second and the reason I'm doing that too

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.609 
second and the reason I'm doing that too
is<00:02:07.970> if<00:02:08.970> you're<00:02:09.269> doing<00:02:09.539> something<00:02:10.019> like<00:02:10.170> maybe

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
is if you're doing something like maybe

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.010 
is if you're doing something like maybe
you<00:02:10.800> mixed<00:02:11.160> media<00:02:11.580> work

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:13.020 
you mixed media work

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:16.520 
you mixed media work
and<00:02:13.470> you<00:02:14.160> want<00:02:14.370> to<00:02:14.430> bring<00:02:14.640> in<00:02:14.880> a<00:02:15.120> stamp<00:02:15.690> they

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:16.530 
and you want to bring in a stamp they

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.350 
and you want to bring in a stamp they
can<00:02:16.710> do<00:02:16.800> that<00:02:16.980> you<00:02:17.340> can<00:02:17.760> start<00:02:18.060> to<00:02:18.180> incorporate

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:18.360 
can do that you can start to incorporate

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.720 
can do that you can start to incorporate
that<00:02:18.930> in<00:02:19.140> here<00:02:19.380> too<00:02:19.560> so<00:02:19.830> I<00:02:19.860> can<00:02:20.040> use<00:02:20.190> that<00:02:20.460> and

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
that in here too so I can use that and

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.170 
that in here too so I can use that and
then<00:02:21.120> also<00:02:21.690> because<00:02:22.050> this<00:02:22.200> is<00:02:22.350> an<00:02:22.470> acrylic

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:23.180 
then also because this is an acrylic

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.730 
then also because this is an acrylic
emulsion<00:02:24.180> what<00:02:24.540> I<00:02:24.570> can<00:02:24.810> do<00:02:24.960> I've<00:02:25.140> got<00:02:25.170> pouring

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:25.740 
emulsion what I can do I've got pouring

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:27.500 
emulsion what I can do I've got pouring
medium<00:02:26.100> in<00:02:26.250> here<00:02:26.460> already<00:02:26.790> I'm<00:02:26.940> gonna<00:02:27.120> take<00:02:27.330> I

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
medium in here already I'm gonna take I

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.690 
medium in here already I'm gonna take I
think<00:02:27.690> a<00:02:27.750> different<00:02:27.990> color<00:02:28.380> now<00:02:28.470> this<00:02:29.250> is<00:02:29.490> a
