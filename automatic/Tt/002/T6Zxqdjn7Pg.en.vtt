because it offline because it's broken

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:42.309 
because it offline because it's broken

for some reason that it'll why and i'm

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:47.740 
for some reason that it'll why and i'm
just<00:02:42.410> going<00:02:42.500> to<00:02:42.650> build<00:02:42.920> big<00:02:43.910> arena<00:02:46.569> I'm<00:02:47.569> not

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:47.750 
just going to build big arena I'm not

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:48.729 
just going to build big arena I'm not
gonna<00:02:47.900> be<00:02:47.989> that<00:02:48.140> big<00:02:48.319> because<00:02:48.500> I<00:02:48.590> don't<00:02:48.709> want

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:48.739 
gonna be that big because I don't want

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:50.199 
gonna be that big because I don't want
the<00:02:48.890> running<00:02:49.340> around<00:02:49.430> like<00:02:49.700> noobs<00:02:50.000> and

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:50.209 
the running around like noobs and

00:02:50.209 --> 00:03:00.250 
the running around like noobs and
camping<00:02:50.660> and<00:02:56.889> I<00:02:57.889> guess<00:02:58.720> probably<00:02:59.720> make<00:03:00.049> the

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:00.260 
camping and I guess probably make the

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:08.220 
camping and I guess probably make the
border<00:03:00.910> for<00:03:01.910> this<00:03:02.540> side<00:03:02.840> to<00:03:03.109> about<00:03:03.380> here<00:03:04.250> I

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:08.230 

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:13.700 

don't<00:03:09.230> like<00:03:09.260> it<00:03:09.500> iron

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:13.710 

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:16.310 

and<00:03:14.370> I'll<00:03:14.760> just<00:03:14.790> cover<00:03:15.360> up<00:03:15.510> on<00:03:15.840> the<00:03:15.990> floor

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
and I'll just cover up on the floor

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:19.010 
and I'll just cover up on the floor
everything<00:03:16.890> later<00:03:17.540> so<00:03:18.540> that's<00:03:18.690> just<00:03:18.930> the

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:19.020 
everything later so that's just the

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:23.570 
everything later so that's just the
beginning<00:03:19.110> of<00:03:19.500> it<00:03:20.180> and<00:03:21.830> you<00:03:22.830> may<00:03:22.980> look<00:03:23.160> crappy

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:23.580 
beginning of it and you may look crappy

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:27.800 
beginning of it and you may look crappy
like<00:03:23.850> when<00:03:24.120> it's<00:03:24.240> finished<00:03:24.300> and<00:03:24.810> I<00:03:25.140> shall<00:03:26.810> try

00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:52.319 
and I just need to get cutting down

00:03:52.319 --> 00:04:03.650 
and I just need to get cutting down
these<00:03:52.470> trees<00:03:52.670> and<00:04:01.790> I<00:04:02.790> think<00:04:03.120> it's<00:04:03.239> a<00:04:03.300> pain

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 
these trees and I think it's a pain

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.690 
these trees and I think it's a pain
about<00:04:03.690> this<00:04:04.230> is<00:04:04.440> just<00:04:04.680> all<00:04:04.800> the<00:04:04.890> trees<00:04:05.280> yet<00:04:05.550> to

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:05.700 
about this is just all the trees yet to

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:13.970 
about this is just all the trees yet to
cut<00:04:07.430> to<00:04:08.430> actually<00:04:08.730> make<00:04:09.000> the<00:04:09.239> server<00:04:12.860> up<00:04:13.860> at

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980 
cut to actually make the server up at

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:15.949 
cut to actually make the server up at
the<00:04:14.040> IP<00:04:14.190> in<00:04:14.430> the<00:04:14.519> description<00:04:14.549> i'll<00:04:15.540> put<00:04:15.810> the

00:04:15.949 --> 00:04:15.959 
the IP in the description i'll put the

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:19.659 
the IP in the description i'll put the
date<00:04:16.199> on<00:04:16.620> it<00:04:16.680> no<00:04:17.010> much<00:04:17.220> should<00:04:17.549> be<00:04:17.699> finished

00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:19.669 
date on it no much should be finished

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:23.659 
date on it no much should be finished
probably<00:04:20.669> be<00:04:20.790> around<00:04:22.310> about<00:04:23.310> two<00:04:23.490> days

00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:23.669 
probably be around about two days

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:33.830 
probably be around about two days
because<00:04:24.210> i<00:04:24.419> can<00:04:24.600> build<00:04:24.780> fast<00:04:27.450> cow<00:04:32.840> so

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
because i can build fast cow so

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.120 
because i can build fast cow so
yeah<00:04:33.990> all<00:04:34.200> these<00:04:34.380> trees<00:04:34.650> are<00:04:34.710> gonna<00:04:34.919> have<00:04:35.040> to

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:35.130 
yeah all these trees are gonna have to

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:36.890 
yeah all these trees are gonna have to
be<00:04:35.220> cut<00:04:35.250> down<00:04:35.460> I<00:04:35.880> just<00:04:36.120> might<00:04:36.270> as<00:04:36.330> well<00:04:36.450> start

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:36.900 
be cut down I just might as well start

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:42.219 
be cut down I just might as well start
making<00:04:36.960> this<00:04:37.320> come<00:04:37.560> closer<00:04:40.070> there<00:04:41.070> the<00:04:41.250> border

00:04:42.219 --> 00:04:42.229

chest<00:04:55.620> I'll<00:04:55.889> make<00:04:56.010> that<00:04:56.160> one<00:04:56.280> of<00:04:56.340> the<00:04:56.400> rules

00:04:56.570 --> 00:04:56.580 
chest I'll make that one of the rules

00:04:56.580 --> 00:05:00.500 
chest I'll make that one of the rules
and<00:04:57.060> they<00:04:57.690> me<00:04:57.810> and<00:04:58.229> then<00:04:59.160> our<00:04:59.389> replenish<00:05:00.389> on

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:00.510 
and they me and then our replenish on

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:06.050 
and they me and then our replenish on
the<00:05:00.600> ammunition<00:05:04.490> and<00:05:05.490> I<00:05:05.610> actually<00:05:05.729> I<00:05:06.030> just

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:06.060 
the ammunition and I actually I just

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:08.900 
the ammunition and I actually I just
make<00:05:06.720> a<00:05:06.750> chest<00:05:07.080> or<00:05:07.289> you<00:05:07.410> just<00:05:07.560> put<00:05:07.800> them<00:05:07.889> on<00:05:08.099> one

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:08.910 
make a chest or you just put them on one

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:12.890 
make a chest or you just put them on one
chest<00:05:09.240> and<00:05:09.419> not<00:05:09.599> reorganize<00:05:10.260> them<00:05:11.720> so<00:05:12.720> there's

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:12.900 
chest and not reorganize them so there's

00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:17.260 
chest and not reorganize them so there's
plenty<00:05:12.990> of<00:05:13.169> ammo<00:05:13.349> for<00:05:13.590> each<00:05:13.770> gun

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:17.270 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:19.490 

flamethrowers<00:05:18.270> I'm<00:05:18.479> putting<00:05:18.870> hidden<00:05:19.080> chest

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:19.500 
flamethrowers I'm putting hidden chest

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:21.890 
flamethrowers I'm putting hidden chest
around<00:05:19.680> for<00:05:20.039> other<00:05:20.190> weapons<00:05:20.630> especially<00:05:21.630> the

00:05:21.890 --> 00:05:21.900 
around for other weapons especially the

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:23.300 
around for other weapons especially the
flamethrowers<00:05:22.380> I<00:05:22.470> reckon<00:05:22.830> just<00:05:23.070> going<00:05:23.250> to

00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:23.310 
flamethrowers I reckon just going to

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:26.870 
flamethrowers I reckon just going to
give<00:05:23.430> people<00:05:23.580> flamethrowers<00:05:25.639> make<00:05:26.639> it<00:05:26.760> up<00:05:26.849> by

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:26.880 
give people flamethrowers make it up by

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:38.280 
give people flamethrowers make it up by
yay<00:05:27.539> high<00:05:30.710> and<00:05:31.710> we<00:05:32.250> just<00:05:32.280> change<00:05:32.849> the<00:05:33.060> time

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:38.290 

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:40.210 

maybe<00:05:39.290> i'll<00:05:39.410> make<00:05:39.530> that<00:05:39.560> a<00:05:39.710> little<00:05:39.800> bit<00:05:39.979> closer

00:05:40.210 --> 00:05:40.220 
maybe i'll make that a little bit closer

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:44.920 
maybe i'll make that a little bit closer
it's<00:05:40.430> gonna<00:05:40.520> be<00:05:40.669> a<00:05:40.699> lot<00:05:40.790> of<00:05:40.850> building<00:05:43.780> see<00:05:44.780> the

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:44.930 
it's gonna be a lot of building see the

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:46.600 
it's gonna be a lot of building see the
