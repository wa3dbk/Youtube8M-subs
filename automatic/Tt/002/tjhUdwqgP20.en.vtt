00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:21.150
 Y 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:28.960
 what is a competition and how is it 

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:28.960
 acquire 

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:35.960
 what do we mean by competition 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:39.110
 it is a complex act knowing that demands 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:42.080
 mobilize and combine human capabilities 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:45.440
 of different nature as 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:48.290
 knowledge cognitive skills and 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:51.670
 partner emotional dispositions 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:55.380
 Affective ethical principles 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:57.690
 concrete procedures and so on 

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:03.140
 to build a relevant response 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:03.140
 and effective to a given challenge 

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:17.300
 a competition is a current knowledge 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:20.360
 complex to the extent that it demands 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:22.670
 mobilize and combine human capabilities 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:25.890
 of different nature 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:28.289
 knowledge cognitive skills and 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:31.039
 partner emotional dispositions 

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:34.500
 Affective ethical principles 

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:37.200
 concrete procedures and so on for 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:40.130
 build a relevant response and 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:43.009
 effective to a particular challenge 

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:46.240
 so for a person to be 

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:49.789
 competent needs to master certain 

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:52.909
 knowledge skills and a broad 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:55.850
 variety of knowledge or resources but 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:58.789
 above all you need to know how to transfer them 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:01.490
 of the context in which they were learned 

00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:03.920
 another one to apply them and 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:07.990
 combinedly use in 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.990
 function of a certain objective 

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:22.740
 How competences are acquired 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:24.750
 from challenging situations 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:27.330
 so that students can learn 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:30.470
 to act competently in 

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:33.710
 various areas need to face 

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:37.010
 Repeatedly challenging situations 

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:39.710
 that require them to select mobilize and 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:42.020
 combining strategically 

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:45.670
 capacities that consider more 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:45.670
 necessary to solve them 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:55.480
 when a significant situation or 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:59.040
 problematic can be perceived as a 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.040
 challenge for the students 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:03.720
 to the extent that you keep in relation to 

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:07.010
 your interests 

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:11.520
 with personal social contexts 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:14.450
 cultural or environmental school 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:17.600
 own of each specific knowledge 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:20.780
 constitute significant challenges 

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:24.020
 it can be real situations or 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:25.880
 also simulated but referring to the 

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:28.630
 daily activities of 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.630
 students 

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:38.380
 of the general 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:38.380
 to the particular and vice versa 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:50.260
 the pedagogical process needs to start 

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:52.090
 as already said with a situation 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:54.430
 challenging that wakes up in the 

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:57.219
 students 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:04:01.010
 and therefore the need to put 

00:03:57.219 --> 00:04:03.860
 Test your skills to solve it 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:07.040
 as in any dynamic process it will be 

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:11.349
 necessary to permanently return to 

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.349
 Statement of challenging situations 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:23.650
 how competition is acquired 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:23.650
 building significantly 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:31.979
 the student is required to handle the 

00:04:29.319 --> 00:04:31.979
 information 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:37.430
 and the concepts you will need 

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:41.260
 raised 

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:46.100
 in another type of knowledge 

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:03.990
 and progressively 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:21.750
 collard the student to write those 

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:24.320
 levels is the function of the maps of 

00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:24.320
 progress
