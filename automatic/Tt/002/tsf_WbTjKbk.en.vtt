really recording this as you can see
another<00:03:31.370> skeleton<00:03:32.690> just<00:03:33.690> came<00:03:34.290> through<00:03:34.320> and

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
another skeleton just came through and

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:35.480 
another skeleton just came through and
died<00:03:34.830> instantly

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:35.490 
died instantly

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:37.010

long<00:04:03.630> and<00:04:03.840> even<00:04:04.500> the<00:04:04.650> deck<00:04:05.130> Trinity<00:04:05.460> and<00:04:05.550> the

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:05.640 
long and even the deck Trinity and the

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.150 
long and even the deck Trinity and the
ground<00:04:05.880> states<00:04:06.420> are<00:04:06.600> a<00:04:06.630> good<00:04:06.840> problem<00:04:07.530> I

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:08.160 
ground states are a good problem I

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:09.440 
ground states are a good problem I
didn't<00:04:08.370> really<00:04:08.580> count<00:04:08.760> but<00:04:09.000> it<00:04:09.120> looked<00:04:09.330> like

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.450 
didn't really count but it looked like

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:11.660 
didn't really count but it looked like
it<00:04:09.540> was<00:04:09.600> gonna<00:04:09.720> least<00:04:10.080> 30<00:04:10.290> seconds<00:04:10.680> or<00:04:10.830> so<00:04:10.860> it's

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:11.670 
it was gonna least 30 seconds or so it's

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:14.450 
it was gonna least 30 seconds or so it's
definitely<00:04:12.000> a<00:04:12.090> good<00:04:12.600> amount<00:04:12.810> of<00:04:12.930> time<00:04:13.280> you<00:04:14.280> see

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:14.460 
definitely a good amount of time you see

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:17.390 
definitely a good amount of time you see
