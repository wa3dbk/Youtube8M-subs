00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:06.480 
and then put another drop at the end now
this<00:01:04.449> one<00:01:04.659> is<00:01:04.780> going<00:01:04.900> to<00:01:04.960> go<00:01:05.170> directly<00:01:05.619> to<00:01:06.100> your

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:06.490 
this one is going to go directly to your

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:09.749 
this one is going to go directly to your
Lantern<00:01:06.909> so<00:01:07.630> stick<00:01:07.869> it<00:01:07.960> down<00:01:08.399> hold<00:01:09.399> it<00:01:09.520> for<00:01:09.700> a

00:01:09.749 --> 00:01:09.759 
Lantern so stick it down hold it for a

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:13.440 
Lantern so stick it down hold it for a
second<00:01:11.009> you're<00:01:12.009> going<00:01:12.130> to<00:01:12.189> make<00:01:12.310> more<00:01:12.460> it<00:01:13.270> goes

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:13.450 
second you're going to make more it goes

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:15.270 
second you're going to make more it goes
pretty<00:01:13.630> fast<00:01:13.899> if<00:01:14.259> you<00:01:14.409> glue<00:01:14.799> all<00:01:14.950> the<00:01:15.040> filters

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280 
pretty fast if you glue all the filters

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.200 
pretty fast if you glue all the filters
beforehand<00:01:16.619> so<00:01:17.619> you<00:01:18.490> can<00:01:18.610> fold<00:01:18.820> a<00:01:18.940> bunch<00:01:19.090> of

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:19.210 
beforehand so you can fold a bunch of

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:21.270 
beforehand so you can fold a bunch of
two<00:01:19.330> tacos<00:01:19.570> and<00:01:20.140> then<00:01:20.470> again<00:01:20.710> put<00:01:21.009> the<00:01:21.100> glue<00:01:21.250> in

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:21.280 
two tacos and then again put the glue in

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:27.560 
two tacos and then again put the glue in
the<00:01:21.430> middle<00:01:22.950> hold<00:01:23.950> it

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.139 

glue<00:01:28.570> on<00:01:28.689> the<00:01:28.780> point<00:01:29.080> and<00:01:29.860> stick<00:01:30.700> it<00:01:30.789> on<00:01:30.909> and

00:01:31.139 --> 00:01:31.149 
glue on the point and stick it on and

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:33.749 
glue on the point and stick it on and
the<00:01:31.780> closer<00:01:32.020> you<00:01:32.319> stick<00:01:32.619> them<00:01:32.830> the<00:01:33.340> tighter<00:01:33.640> it

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:33.759 
the closer you stick them the tighter it

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:37.020 
the closer you stick them the tighter it
will<00:01:34.000> be<00:01:34.119> if<00:01:34.929> you<00:01:35.050> spread<00:01:35.319> them<00:01:35.530> out<00:01:35.940> it<00:01:36.940> will

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.030 
will be if you spread them out it will

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.109 
will be if you spread them out it will
just<00:01:37.090> be<00:01:37.360> a<00:01:37.390> more<00:01:37.840> relaxed<00:01:38.409> pop<00:01:38.679> so<00:01:39.670> they're

00:01:40.109 --> 00:01:40.119 
just be a more relaxed pop so they're

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:42.630 
just be a more relaxed pop so they're
going<00:01:40.210> to<00:01:40.270> glue<00:01:40.420> it<00:01:40.479> on<00:01:40.569> like<00:01:40.750> this<00:01:41.490> I'm<00:01:42.490> going

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:42.640 
going to glue it on like this I'm going

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.330 
going to glue it on like this I'm going
to<00:01:42.700> put<00:01:42.819> this<00:01:42.909> one<00:01:43.090> aside<00:01:43.619> so<00:01:44.619> this<00:01:44.799> one<00:01:45.039> is

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:45.340 
to put this one aside so this one is

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.219 
to put this one aside so this one is
completely<00:01:45.789> glued<00:01:46.119> and<00:01:46.810> you're<00:01:46.929> not<00:01:47.049> going<00:01:47.170> to

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:47.229 
completely glued and you're not going to

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:48.690 
completely glued and you're not going to
use<00:01:47.319> a<00:01:47.380> whole<00:01:47.560> stack<00:01:47.799> of<00:01:47.830> coffee<00:01:48.130> filters<00:01:48.520> this

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:48.700 
use a whole stack of coffee filters this

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.609 
use a whole stack of coffee filters this
one's<00:01:48.880> really<00:01:49.179> tight<00:01:49.509> but<00:01:50.289> I'll<00:01:50.380> show<00:01:50.560> you

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:50.619 
one's really tight but I'll show you

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:52.139 
one's really tight but I'll show you
this<00:01:51.009> is<00:01:51.130> what<00:01:51.280> they<00:01:51.399> look<00:01:51.580> like<00:01:51.610> when<00:01:52.060> you

00:01:52.139 --> 00:01:52.149 
this is what they look like when you

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:53.669 
this is what they look like when you
first<00:01:52.179> glue<00:01:52.539> them<00:01:52.720> on<00:01:52.840> see<00:01:53.049> how<00:01:53.170> flat<00:01:53.409> they<00:01:53.590> are

00:01:53.669 --> 00:01:53.679 
first glue them on see how flat they are

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:55.859 
first glue them on see how flat they are
now<00:01:54.549> when<00:01:54.700> you<00:01:54.819> start<00:01:55.030> ruffling<00:01:55.420> them<00:01:55.600> that's

00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:55.869 
now when you start ruffling them that's

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:57.449 
now when you start ruffling them that's
what<00:01:56.020> makes<00:01:56.200> it<00:01:56.289> look<00:01:56.440> like<00:01:56.619> a<00:01:56.649> big<00:01:56.890> rose<00:01:57.130> ball

00:01:57.449 --> 00:01:57.459 
what makes it look like a big rose ball

00:01:57.459 --> 00:02:00.359

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:05.810 
you know now we're going to make a

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:07.569 
you know now we're going to make a
fabric<00:03:06.200> pump<00:03:06.560> this<00:03:06.980> is<00:03:07.129> a<00:03:07.220> little<00:03:07.430> more

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:07.579 
fabric pump this is a little more

00:03:07.579 --> 00:03:09.039 
fabric pump this is a little more
expensive<00:03:07.849> because<00:03:08.359> you're<00:03:08.480> using<00:03:08.750> styrofoam

00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:09.049 
expensive because you're using styrofoam

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:10.839 
expensive because you're using styrofoam
and<00:03:09.590> not<00:03:09.680> a<00:03:09.709> Chinese<00:03:10.099> lantern<00:03:10.340> and<00:03:10.760> the

00:03:14.259 --> 00:03:14.269 
styrofoam is a little more costly so you

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:16.720 
styrofoam is a little more costly so you
need<00:03:14.420> a<00:03:14.450> Styrofoam<00:03:14.930> ball<00:03:15.079> to<00:03:15.709> start<00:03:15.950> use<00:03:16.579> any

open them and spread them out and you're

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:02.420 
open them and spread them out and you're
just<00:04:01.500> going<00:04:01.620> to<00:04:01.680> put<00:04:01.860> them<00:04:01.980> everywhere<00:04:02.129> of

just going to put them everywhere of
their<00:04:02.519> space<00:04:02.760> you<00:04:02.909> don't<00:04:03.000> want<00:04:03.180> to<00:04:03.239> see<00:04:03.329> any

their space you don't want to see any

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.990 
their space you don't want to see any
styrofoam<00:04:03.900> so<00:04:04.530> you<00:04:04.620> keep<00:04:04.769> going<00:04:04.980> until<00:04:05.760> you

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:06.000 
styrofoam so you keep going until you

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.789 
styrofoam so you keep going until you
make<00:04:06.269> an<00:04:06.769> entire<00:04:07.769> ball<00:04:08.629> and<00:04:09.629> basically<00:04:10.530> I<00:04:10.560> just

00:04:10.789 --> 00:04:10.799 
make an entire ball and basically I just

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:13.479 
make an entire ball and basically I just
spread<00:04:11.310> them<00:04:11.430> out<00:04:11.549> when<00:04:12.090> they're<00:04:12.209> on<00:04:12.329> there

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:13.489 
spread them out when they're on there

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:16.039 
spread them out when they're on there
this<00:04:14.489> is<00:04:14.609> what<00:04:14.760> you<00:04:14.819> get<00:04:14.940> now<00:04:15.540> you<00:04:15.569> need<00:04:15.870> to

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
this is what you get now you need to

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:17.599 
this is what you get now you need to
hang<00:04:16.380> them<00:04:16.620> just<00:04:17.130> like<00:04:17.250> we<00:04:17.340> did<00:04:17.459> with<00:04:17.519> the

00:04:17.599 --> 00:04:17.609 
hang them just like we did with the

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:20.840 
hang them just like we did with the
Chinese<00:04:17.970> lantern<00:04:18.959> pom<00:04:19.340> so<00:04:20.340> you<00:04:20.430> find<00:04:20.669> some

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:20.850 
Chinese lantern pom so you find some

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:23.540 
Chinese lantern pom so you find some
string<00:04:21.090> that<00:04:21.269> you<00:04:21.329> like<00:04:22.220> there's<00:04:23.220> a<00:04:23.280> piece<00:04:23.430> of

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:23.550 
string that you like there's a piece of

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:26.980 
string that you like there's a piece of
lace<00:04:24.770> I'm<00:04:25.770> going<00:04:25.889> to<00:04:25.979> tie<00:04:26.190> it<00:04:26.250> into<00:04:26.610> a<00:04:26.760> knot

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:26.990 
lace I'm going to tie it into a knot

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:30.460 
lace I'm going to tie it into a knot
you're<00:04:27.990> going<00:04:28.110> to<00:04:28.169> take<00:04:28.260> another<00:04:28.380> pin<00:04:28.820> and

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:30.470 
you're going to take another pin and

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:32.870 
you're going to take another pin and
you're<00:04:31.470> going<00:04:31.590> to<00:04:31.650> pin<00:04:31.800> it<00:04:31.830> directly<00:04:32.490> to<00:04:32.729> the

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:32.880 
you're going to pin it directly to the

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.570 
you're going to pin it directly to the
ball<00:04:33.030> now<00:04:33.630> this<00:04:33.870> time<00:04:34.169> you<00:04:35.010> can't

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:35.580 
ball now this time you can't

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:38.870 
ball now this time you can't
once<00:04:36.389> you<00:04:36.539> pin<00:04:36.810> it<00:04:37.160> the<00:04:38.160> pin<00:04:38.400> will<00:04:38.580> come<00:04:38.760> out

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:38.880 
once you pin it the pin will come out

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.510 
once you pin it the pin will come out
because<00:04:39.090> the<00:04:39.240> styrofoam<00:04:39.660> is<00:04:39.780> heavy<00:04:39.979> so<00:04:40.979> when

00:04:41.510 --> 00:04:41.520 
because the styrofoam is heavy so when

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:44.360 
because the styrofoam is heavy so when
you<00:04:41.610> pin<00:04:41.910> the<00:04:42.539> fabric<00:04:42.810> you<00:04:43.800> want<00:04:43.919> to<00:04:44.070> take<00:04:44.190> your

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:44.370 
you pin the fabric you want to take your

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:48.620 
you pin the fabric you want to take your
glue<00:04:44.639> gun<00:04:44.960> and<00:04:45.960> you<00:04:46.919> want<00:04:47.100> to<00:04:47.190> put<00:04:47.340> glue<00:04:47.699> over

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:48.630 
glue gun and you want to put glue over

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:51.320 
glue gun and you want to put glue over
the<00:04:49.050> pin<00:04:49.800> you<00:04:50.460> want<00:04:50.550> to<00:04:50.669> really<00:04:50.910> press<00:04:51.090> it<00:04:51.210> in

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:51.330 
the pin you want to really press it in

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:53.510 
the pin you want to really press it in
there<00:04:51.510> and<00:04:51.810> then<00:04:52.470> pour<00:04:52.650> glue<00:04:52.919> on<00:04:53.039> top<00:04:53.190> of<00:04:53.400> it

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:53.520 
there and then pour glue on top of it

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.110 
there and then pour glue on top of it
that<00:04:54.050> creates<00:04:55.050> a<00:04:55.229> seal<00:04:55.500> and<00:04:55.860> that<00:04:55.889> way<00:04:56.669> the

00:04:57.110 --> 00:04:57.120 
that creates a seal and that way the

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:58.219 
that creates a seal and that way the
rope<00:04:57.300> will<00:04:57.449> not<00:04:57.570> come<00:04:57.690> out<00:04:57.810> when<00:04:57.900> you<00:04:57.960> hang<00:04:58.110> it

00:04:58.219 --> 00:04:58.229 
rope will not come out when you hang it

00:04:58.229 --> 00:05:00.830 
rope will not come out when you hang it
so<00:04:59.070> this<00:04:59.160> one<00:04:59.310> will<00:04:59.400> go<00:04:59.460> outside<00:04:59.720> and<00:05:00.720> now

00:05:00.830 --> 00:05:00.840 
so this one will go outside and now

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:02.719 
so this one will go outside and now
again<00:05:00.990> just<00:05:01.770> like<00:05:01.860> we<00:05:01.979> did<00:05:02.130> with<00:05:02.220> the<00:05:02.400> coffee

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:02.729
