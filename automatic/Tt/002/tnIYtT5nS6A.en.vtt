00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:10.400
 performed without worrying on in real 

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:12.110
 time on the screen is usually 

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:15.050
 not all recorded signal is displayed 

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:17.020
 only its endings ie graphics 

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:20.360
 signals are shifted from right to left 

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:22.220
 imitating the movement of the tape recorder when 

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:23.750
 need to view recorded 

00:06:22.220 --> 00:06:26.750
 data directly in the process 

00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:29.050
 registration is enough just to go to 

00:06:26.750 --> 00:06:30.979
 the analyzed signal segment 

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:35.419
