00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.470 
Schumacher before they come back and now
well<00:02:17.610> he<00:02:18.570> certainly<00:02:18.810> got<00:02:19.110> a<00:02:19.170> little<00:02:19.410> bit<00:02:19.500> older

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480 
well he certainly got a little bit older

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.240 
well he certainly got a little bit older
no<00:02:21.480> less<00:02:21.750> competitive<00:02:22.440> in<00:02:22.680> my<00:02:22.800> point<00:02:23.010> of<00:02:23.190> view

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:23.250 
no less competitive in my point of view

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:28.060 
no less competitive in my point of view
certainly<00:02:24.180> no<00:02:24.420> no<00:02:24.900> less<00:02:25.140> determined<00:02:25.560> and<00:02:26.040> I

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:28.070 
certainly no no less determined and I

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:31.220 
certainly no no less determined and I
yeah<00:02:29.070> I<00:02:29.100> see<00:02:29.610> it<00:02:29.730> as<00:02:29.820> a<00:02:29.850> great<00:02:30.030> challenge<00:02:30.300> to

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
yeah I see it as a great challenge to

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.290 
yeah I see it as a great challenge to
fulfill<00:02:31.590> the<00:02:31.739> mission<00:02:31.890> to<00:02:32.400> get<00:02:32.730> Mercedes<00:02:33.150> back

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
fulfill the mission to get Mercedes back

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.810 
fulfill the mission to get Mercedes back
on<00:02:33.450> the<00:02:33.540> winning<00:02:33.630> World<00:02:33.930> the<00:02:34.770> teammate<00:02:35.280> Nico

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:35.820 
on the winning World the teammate Nico

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:38.449 
on the winning World the teammate Nico
was<00:02:36.209> sometimes<00:02:36.600> faster<00:02:36.930> than<00:02:37.320> you<00:02:37.530> what<00:02:38.220> kind

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
was sometimes faster than you what kind

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:39.979 
was sometimes faster than you what kind
of<00:02:38.520> seven<00:02:38.820> times<00:02:39.030> world<00:02:39.300> champion<00:02:39.390> learned

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
of seven times world champion learned

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:43.310 
of seven times world champion learned
from<00:02:40.200> a<00:02:40.350> 26<00:02:41.280> years<00:02:41.610> old<00:02:41.730> guy<00:02:42.030> well<00:02:43.019> if<00:02:43.200> you

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:43.320 
from a 26 years old guy well if you

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.860 
from a 26 years old guy well if you
imagine<00:02:43.500> he's<00:02:43.830> only<00:02:44.040> 26<00:02:44.610> in<00:02:44.880> a<00:02:45.060> way<00:02:45.269> but<00:02:45.330> then

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
imagine he's only 26 in a way but then

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:48.710 
imagine he's only 26 in a way but then
he<00:02:46.290> has<00:02:46.380> about<00:02:46.620> 100<00:02:47.040> grand<00:02:47.310> prison<00:02:47.790> already<00:02:48.570> on

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
he has about 100 grand prison already on

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.270 
he has about 100 grand prison already on
his<00:02:48.840> shoulders<00:02:49.260> so<00:02:49.709> he's<00:02:49.890> reasonably

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
his shoulders so he's reasonably

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.729 
his shoulders so he's reasonably
experience<00:02:50.850> he's<00:02:51.690> certainly<00:02:52.110> quick<00:02:52.380> he's

00:02:52.729 --> 00:02:52.739 
experience he's certainly quick he's

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:54.140 
experience he's certainly quick he's
certainly<00:02:53.070> one<00:02:53.130> of<00:02:53.280> the<00:02:53.459> quickest<00:02:53.790> teammate

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
certainly one of the quickest teammate

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:56.840 
certainly one of the quickest teammate
I've<00:02:54.720> had<00:02:55.049> amongst<00:02:55.920> the<00:02:55.980> others<00:02:56.280> together

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
I've had amongst the others together

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:00.650 
I've had amongst the others together
with<00:02:57.150> Philippa<00:02:57.450> and<00:02:57.750> so<00:02:57.900> on<00:02:58.880> but<00:02:59.880> the<00:03:00.450> good

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
with Philippa and so on but the good

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:02.600 
with Philippa and so on but the good
thing<00:03:00.690> is<00:03:00.900> that<00:03:01.019> the<00:03:01.320> combination<00:03:01.830> of<00:03:01.920> us<00:03:02.130> is

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
thing is that the combination of us is

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:04.400 
thing is that the combination of us is
very<00:03:02.850> positive<00:03:03.090> because<00:03:03.510> we<00:03:03.840> have<00:03:03.989> the<00:03:04.200> same

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:04.410 
very positive because we have the same

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:07.250 
very positive because we have the same
approach<00:03:05.010> we<00:03:05.280> have<00:03:05.400> the<00:03:05.519> same<00:03:05.790> thought<00:03:06.630> how

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
approach we have the same thought how

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.289 
approach we have the same thought how
the<00:03:07.560> car<00:03:07.769> has<00:03:07.980> to<00:03:08.100> behave<00:03:08.280> our<00:03:08.700> kai<00:03:09.000> is<00:03:09.030> to

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:09.299 
the car has to behave our kai is to

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:12.080 
the car has to behave our kai is to
develop<00:03:09.510> how<00:03:09.959> car<00:03:10.230> has<00:03:10.380> to<00:03:10.530> handle<00:03:10.860> that<00:03:11.549> is

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
develop how car has to handle that is

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:14.810 
develop how car has to handle that is
very<00:03:12.299> helpful<00:03:12.510> for<00:03:12.720> the<00:03:12.959> team<00:03:13.140> to<00:03:13.320> focus<00:03:13.560> in<00:03:14.340> in

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:14.820 
very helpful for the team to focus in in

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:18.740

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
whole to come forward who then will make

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.470 
whole to come forward who then will make
the<00:03:22.650> better<00:03:22.829> races<00:03:23.220> or<00:03:23.400> not<00:03:23.579> that<00:03:24.150> will<00:03:24.269> show
