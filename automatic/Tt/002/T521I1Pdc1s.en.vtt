00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.129
 I'm not mistaken because then you'll have 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.610
 now the player who was founded the game 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.920

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.439
 So you understood who got the 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:14.640
 package counter will get access 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:18.509

 ok and during and after the early access 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.700
 Because there are a lot of people who ask 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:35.460
 poxa game closed beta always reset 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:37.530
 Geez, I did not record any more sky. 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:41.820
 precisely because I already knew that I would have a 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:43.860
 reset and when I came back in this levada 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.259

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:48.930
 closed beta they did i'll try 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:51.659
 start from scratch again so I did not have 

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:54.090
 how to record as far as I understand 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:56.100
 was very evolved since then it had not 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.119
 how to get back on that level to start 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:59.790
 record again 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:02.880
 ok then logically also feedback 

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:05.939

00:02:08.489 --> 00:02:13.670
 progress will be permanent 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:15.830

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:59.810

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:03.920
 things legal conditions and understood is a 

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:05.660
 little is medieval with good futuristic 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:07.610
 You've already seen a game you've already seen. 

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:10.730

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:15.380
 working is a different game in this 

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:17.209
 interface is already different from many 

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:20.630
