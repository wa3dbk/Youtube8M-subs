00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:09.910
 kabachi parterre information hello and yes to lot live in the storm 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:11.959
 and where there is a wind blowing 

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:15.799
 very very strong but now that we find everything to their advantage 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:17.960
 and besides for the classico 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.830
 the clasico let's talk ball the barrel rating of the om supporters seemed 

00:00:22.829 --> 00:00:25.890
 supporters of the olympic marseille and when we know declared 

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.529
 completely empty today so we will have for a supporter to pretend 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:34.290
 of supporters of the olympic stadium of marseille for the clasico 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:39.530
 the little finger of jean-claude dassier was certainly right since one 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:40.840
 in more than 10% 

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.840
 will not be there as well as the friends that he said before coming back to the 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:46.789
 this statement 

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:50.430
 on these statements - since he says I quote 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:54.210
 they do not have with this summer the supporters of the olympique de marseille 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.890
 rightly the game goes well because we put them in the same bag that 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.450
 those of paris saint germain 

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:02.359
 so what are his words 

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:05.130
 and behind robin leproux him 

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:09.090
 On the one hand, she wishes to return to her comments by saying that 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.240
 he does not understand that that the recent sending 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.090
 that was all he just wanted to avoid the pitfall wanted this 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:19.000
 be a great footballer's party all have outrage boosts place it is 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.220
 botched the banks it's a failure for both clubs he wants to remember 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.640
 to energies that are not lacking you must not be amnesic 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.979
 because last October 25th then for the first leg for these facts the 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:34.900
 supporters of paris saint germain who spread his gaps in verse 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.230
 but we will not be the same Parisian supporter to be overthrown by a 

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:41.990
 vehicle so percent still something to yield to these serious and 

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.870
 important to report it, and he also wished to point out that 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.020
 the supporters of the olympique de marseille 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.369
 also 

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:55.139
 they did not leave good memories an example for example madrid 

00:01:55.139 --> 00:01:59.399
 will have so these are pretty important ballet lyrics that wanted I ask 

00:01:59.399 --> 00:02:02.190
 beers before classico 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:06.780
 something else allies% it's obviously% to this little boycott 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.249
 questioning straight from asking oneself and wondering 

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:13.790
 this device that had been set up at the Ministry of the Interior on 

00:02:13.789 --> 00:02:15.060
 February 10 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:18.200
 so the one that was managed accepted by the set 

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.669
 protagonists their clubs 

00:02:20.669 --> 00:02:21.880
 little question 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.640
 we are entitled to ask is why boycott something that we 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.029
 accepted two weeks before in the club 

00:02:27.029 --> 00:02:31.259
 several hypotheses have there been fears of 

00:02:31.259 --> 00:02:35.430
 Olympics marseille fans of overflows do not I know 

00:02:35.429 --> 00:02:36.110
 not 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.550
 the cds for other reasons more obscure reasons the reasons for of 

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:42.009
 resale of place I do not know too much 

00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:45.769
 we will not know it anyway it deserves to be asked us 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:49.229
 will also learn insurers antoine kombouaré who is a coach of 

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:54.339
 character who knows how to motivate his troops actually one saves himself two of his 

00:02:54.339 --> 00:02:59.119
 former players who knew him in the old particular aimed at the Czech 

00:02:59.119 --> 00:02:59.799
 jana 

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:04.089
 who say it's a man who is able to transcend the islands of 

00:03:04.089 --> 00:03:08.780
 to insufflate the necessary motivation especially in this kind of meeting so 

00:03:08.779 --> 00:03:11.619
 he thinks of them by uric force 

00:03:11.619 --> 00:03:16.180
 for antoine kombouaré will be motivated in addition to managing the honor that 

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:19.360
 the gamblers of paris saint-germain want to wash and for the club 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:22.419
 to give an excellent result to a victory paris 

00:03:22.419 --> 00:03:25.159
 obviously antoine kombouare also 

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:29.049
 first and foremost, it wants to solidify its defense and 

00:03:29.049 --> 00:03:31.039
 not take a goal one day calls that 

00:03:31.039 --> 00:03:34.039
 the young sakho is suspended as well as stéphane sessègnon 

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:38.430
 and so what to do but perhaps we will have the surprise of Sylvain 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:43.670
 armand in the middle so a hinge a little recomposed showing the camara pair 

00:03:44.529 --> 00:03:48.549
 so that I hope this defense will be strong enough to stay 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:49.700
 still virgin 

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:51.949
 what would that be like the fourth match 

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:55.869
 percent and so on aimlessly what would really be to very good a very 

00:03:55.869 --> 00:03:57.739
 good state of mind and iraq 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:01.749
 he was managing something very emotional to just allow his 

00:04:01.749 --> 00:04:05.519
 diet is often an earlier plan a two-hour win by gear 

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:07.849
 Thursday also information in the halls 

00:04:07.849 --> 00:04:11.779
 in the game especially valérie pécresse even if the wind redouble 

00:04:11.779 --> 00:04:14.169
 I do not know what it will be tonight anyway here I can guarantee you 

00:04:14.169 --> 00:04:18.199
 that the bar there is a lot of wind it's really a storm 

00:04:19.469 --> 00:04:24.389
 lyon going to walk you said still yael naim a few hours that according to him 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:30.649
 the second the ball face there was reason hard goliath please maybe tonight 

00:04:30.649 --> 00:04:34.599
 precisely with all these low times we will see a beautiful 

00:04:34.599 --> 00:04:36.550
 victory of paris saint germain 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:41.110
 we also hear about ludovic giuly who in a Parisian article 

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:44.110
 for not quoting him so god the day before 

00:04:44.779 --> 00:04:47.169
 the chance to have a happy coach 

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:50.190
 enough to listen to him and that makes him a total confidence 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:53.480
 and that's why every time he's gone there's no 

00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:56.300
 had that claude puel or didier deschamps in particular that he will find 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:01.130
 tonight but in the opposing camp and in this confidence make him want to 

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:05.120
 give everything on the ground of auxerre hope that with antoine kombouare this 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:08.820
 the same thing and that suddenly it can be drawn those darfur 

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:12.760
 since i remind you of your last matches el bahri was passionate about 

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:16.350
 the supporters of paris saint germain for precisely the jersey he has 

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:19.410
 shine so do not forget so let's hope it's the same thing this 

00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:19.979
 evening 

00:05:19.979 --> 00:05:23.600
 jordi folding on a brandao I remind you that there is great uncertainty 

00:05:23.599 --> 00:05:26.990
 about what he would do not suddenly part of the group that he will 

00:05:26.990 --> 00:05:30.039
 titularized ba so I can not answer the second question in 

00:05:30.039 --> 00:05:33.490
 however it is well part of the group and it will be good to say that 

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:37.770
 in the group and certainly on the bench tonight for classico 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:42.639
 finally at the end of the last minute we warned yesterday that Peguy luyindula 

00:05:42.639 --> 00:05:48.740
 was likely the accents of the classico actually make it clear 

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:52.939
 knee pain is too important for them to take risks and 

00:05:52.939 --> 00:05:56.199
 so low blow to several votes opportunity to outgoing Antoine 

00:05:56.199 --> 00:06:00.199
 kombuare to replace it actually there is the possibility for 

00:06:00.199 --> 00:06:04.220
 them of clement chantôme we spoke to you yesterday but we also speak 

00:06:04.219 --> 00:06:08.789
 also young sankharé who can replace him instead and place but 

00:06:08.789 --> 00:06:11.819
 also since matt henjak spain is part of the group he can also 

00:06:11.819 --> 00:06:17.020
 be played in this role so big question mark prognostic side 

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:20.719
 to replace a zoo rock soup to support that clement chantôme 

00:06:20.719 --> 00:06:25.810
 will be the ideal substitute now place in the field we will see what's going 

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:28.939
 give on everything go paris 

00:06:28.939 --> 00:06:30.149
 good luck ben ali
