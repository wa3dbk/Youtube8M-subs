00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
know all the properties here it's best

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.420 
know all the properties here it's best
to<00:02:30.930> memorize<00:02:31.319> them<00:02:31.590> it<00:02:31.799> takes<00:02:32.040> a<00:02:32.129> lot<00:02:32.159> of<00:02:32.310> time

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:32.430 
to memorize them it takes a lot of time

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.250 
to memorize them it takes a lot of time
you<00:02:32.909> need<00:02:33.060> a<00:02:33.120> lot<00:02:33.299> of<00:02:33.420> free<00:02:33.599> time<00:02:33.629> to<00:02:33.959> do<00:02:34.079> this

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
you need a lot of free time to do this

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.490 
you need a lot of free time to do this
so<00:02:35.159> you<00:02:35.220> know<00:02:35.519> if<00:02:35.819> you<00:02:35.939> have<00:02:36.090> a<00:02:36.450> full-time<00:02:37.290> job

do the skin games up workspace pay yo 39

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:56.089 
do the skin games up workspace pay yo 39
or<00:02:53.129> your<00:02:53.730> name<00:02:53.909> was<00:02:54.180> again<00:02:54.209> that<00:02:55.169> humanoid<00:02:55.739> and

thoughts walk capital s PE D equals 100

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.470 
thoughts walk capital s PE D equals 100
make<00:03:01.500> sure<00:03:01.620> you<00:03:02.189> realize<00:03:02.549> the<00:03:02.669> capitalization

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:03.480 
make sure you realize the capitalization

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.050 
make sure you realize the capitalization
does<00:03:03.720> count<00:03:04.169> so<00:03:04.919> if<00:03:05.069> your<00:03:05.189> name<00:03:05.400> is<00:03:05.579> all<00:03:05.730> caps

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:16.889 
do that here capitalizing does count so

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:19.819 
do that here capitalizing does count so
H<00:03:17.129> needs<00:03:17.639> to<00:03:17.729> be<00:03:17.819> capital<00:03:18.239> W<00:03:19.169> and<00:03:19.199> walks<00:03:19.560> being

i'm walking normal speed now but uh one
makes<00:03:43.799> you<00:03:43.889> really<00:03:44.159> slow<00:03:46.159> it's<00:03:47.159> pretty<00:03:47.340> funny

00:03:50.569 --> 00:03:50.579 
actually but uh what's nice about walk

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:53.539 
actually but uh what's nice about walk
speed<00:03:50.760> is<00:03:50.909> this<00:03:51.030> is<00:03:51.180> actually<00:03:51.829> it<00:03:52.829> wasn't<00:03:53.040> here

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:53.549 
speed is this is actually it wasn't here

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:55.819 
speed is this is actually it wasn't here
when<00:03:54.030> i<00:03:54.180> was<00:03:54.329> around<00:03:54.449> at<00:03:54.810> first<00:03:55.079> because<00:03:55.590> i

00:03:55.819 --> 00:03:55.829 
when i was around at first because i

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:57.229 
when i was around at first because i
think<00:03:55.889> it<00:03:56.129> came<00:03:56.250> out<00:03:56.400> in<00:03:56.579> either<00:03:56.760> late<00:03:57.090> two

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:57.239 
think it came out in either late two

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:00.379 
think it came out in either late two
thousand<00:03:57.689> eight<00:03:57.870> or<00:03:58.849> early<00:03:59.849> two<00:04:00.000> thousand

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:00.389 
thousand eight or early two thousand

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:04.339 
thousand eight or early two thousand
nine<00:04:00.419> so<00:04:01.409> that's<00:04:01.439> pretty<00:04:02.069> interesting<00:04:03.349> you

00:04:04.339 --> 00:04:04.349 
nine so that's pretty interesting you

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:06.199 
nine so that's pretty interesting you
know<00:04:04.439> i<00:04:04.680> didn't<00:04:05.340> have<00:04:05.459> this<00:04:05.639> when<00:04:05.819> i<00:04:05.849> first

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:06.209 
know i didn't have this when i first

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:09.099 
know i didn't have this when i first
grew<00:04:06.959> up<00:04:07.109> in<00:04:07.680> i<00:04:07.829> guess<00:04:08.010> you<00:04:08.129> could<00:04:08.280> say

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:09.109 
grew up in i guess you could say

00:04:09.109 --> 00:04:11.240 
grew up in i guess you could say
now<00:04:10.109> we're<00:04:10.229> gonna<00:04:10.319> change<00:04:10.590> the<00:04:10.769> name<00:04:10.979> of<00:04:11.009> the

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
humanoid so we're gonna change you know
