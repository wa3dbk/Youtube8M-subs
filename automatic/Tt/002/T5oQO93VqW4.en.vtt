bit longer but tastes better put it in
slowly<00:03:31.770> I'm<00:03:32.770> eyeballing<00:03:33.040> it<00:03:33.400> but<00:03:33.640> it<00:03:33.760> is

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:33.880 
slowly I'm eyeballing it but it is

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.070 
slowly I'm eyeballing it but it is
really<00:03:34.150> good<00:03:34.270> to<00:03:34.300> measure<00:03:34.570> it<00:03:34.660> if<00:03:34.810> you<00:03:34.900> haven't

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:35.080 
really good to measure it if you haven't

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:46.030 
going to soak up all this liquid so you

00:03:46.030 --> 00:03:51.510 
going to soak up all this liquid so you
don't<00:03:46.180> want<00:03:46.360> to<00:03:46.480> get<00:03:47.050> too<00:03:47.230> crazy<00:03:47.470> put<00:03:47.860> much<00:03:48.100> in
