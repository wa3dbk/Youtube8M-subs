and first thing I want to point out is
something<00:01:04.799> I've<00:01:05.040> been<00:01:05.070> noticing<00:01:05.670> a<00:01:05.880> lot<00:01:06.030> with

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
something I've been noticing a lot with

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.670 
something I've been noticing a lot with
figures<00:01:06.510> something<00:01:06.810> that<00:01:07.080> I<00:01:07.110> really<00:01:07.500> dislike

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
figures something that I really dislike

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.580 
figures something that I really dislike
and<00:01:08.070> that<00:01:08.610> is<00:01:08.880> the<00:01:09.210> lack<00:01:09.720> of<00:01:10.020> color

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
and that is the lack of color

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.980 
and that is the lack of color
coordination<00:01:11.310> you<00:01:11.700> can<00:01:12.030> hopefully<00:01:12.360> see<00:01:12.630> that

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
coordination you can hopefully see that

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:15.950 
coordination you can hopefully see that
his<00:01:13.170> head<00:01:13.409> is<00:01:13.650> a<00:01:14.070> different<00:01:14.460> shade<00:01:14.729> than<00:01:15.060> his

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
his head is a different shade than his

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.580 
his head is a different shade than his
body<00:01:16.439> and<00:01:16.890> it<00:01:17.400> looks<00:01:17.700> kind<00:01:18.060> of<00:01:18.180> weird<00:01:18.420> and<00:01:19.170> I

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
body and it looks kind of weird and I

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.020 
body and it looks kind of weird and I
think<00:01:19.860> they<00:01:19.979> do<00:01:20.159> use<00:01:20.430> a<00:01:20.460> different<00:01:20.880> type<00:01:21.000> of

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
think they do use a different type of

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.789 
think they do use a different type of
plastic<00:01:21.570> for<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:21.780> face<00:01:22.020> which<00:01:22.259> sticks<00:01:22.650> out

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:22.799 
plastic for the face which sticks out

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:25.910 
plastic for the face which sticks out
looks<00:01:23.670> like<00:01:23.820> he<00:01:23.909> doesn't<00:01:24.060> know<00:01:24.420> neck<00:01:24.920> really

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
pants on the front you can kind of

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:59.690 
pants on the front you can kind of
believe<00:01:56.369> it<00:01:56.729> but<00:01:57.240> this<00:01:57.719> the<00:01:58.500> thing<00:01:58.710> is<00:01:58.860> like<00:01:59.100> if

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
believe it but this the thing is like if

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.319 
believe it but this the thing is like if
you<00:01:59.939> got<00:02:00.270> this<00:02:00.450> figure<00:02:01.219> just<00:02:02.219> basing<00:02:02.700> it<00:02:02.850> on<00:02:03.000> it

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:03.329 
you got this figure just basing it on it

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.510 
you got this figure just basing it on it
is<00:02:03.450> I'd<00:02:04.259> say<00:02:04.290> the<00:02:04.590> main<00:02:04.740> flaw<00:02:05.009> is<00:02:05.189> that<00:02:05.219> the

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
is I'd say the main flaw is that the

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.119 
is I'd say the main flaw is that the
head<00:02:05.700> is<00:02:05.880> too<00:02:06.299> small<00:02:06.600> and<00:02:06.780> too<00:02:06.840> low<00:02:07.200> but<00:02:08.039> it

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
head is too small and too low but it

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:09.800 
head is too small and too low but it
looks<00:02:08.310> pretty<00:02:08.700> good<00:02:09.030> except<00:02:09.390> for<00:02:09.509> the<00:02:09.599> back<00:02:09.780> of

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
looks pretty good except for the back of

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:11.510 
looks pretty good except for the back of
the<00:02:10.020> pants<00:02:10.379> this<00:02:10.470> does<00:02:10.739> not<00:02:10.920> look<00:02:11.129> like<00:02:11.190> Dean

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520

Ambrose they go to

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:16.160

in<00:02:13.740> the<00:02:14.040> back<00:02:14.250> that's<00:02:14.730> talking<00:02:15.000> fashion<00:02:15.330> then

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
in the back that's talking fashion then
