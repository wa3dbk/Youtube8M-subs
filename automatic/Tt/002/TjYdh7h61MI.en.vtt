00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
I sound really really immature saying

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.549 
I sound really really immature saying
that<00:00:42.239> you<00:00:42.570> know<00:00:42.690> like<00:00:42.840> a<00:00:42.870> hair<00:00:43.140> color<00:00:43.379> is

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
that you know like a hair color is

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:46.220 
that you know like a hair color is
really<00:00:43.710> close<00:00:44.040> to<00:00:44.070> my<00:00:44.219> heart<00:00:44.309> but<00:00:44.760> I<00:00:44.940> had<00:00:45.510> that

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
really close to my heart but I had that

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.810 
really close to my heart but I had that
color<00:00:46.530> for<00:00:46.890> almost<00:00:48.289> I'd<00:00:49.289> say<00:00:49.590> like<00:00:49.800> 6<00:00:50.309> or<00:00:50.460> 7

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
color for almost I'd say like 6 or 7

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:53.119 
color for almost I'd say like 6 or 7
months<00:00:51.000> and<00:00:51.660> it<00:00:52.170> was<00:00:52.230> something<00:00:52.710> that<00:00:52.739> I

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
months and it was something that I

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.119 
months and it was something that I
really<00:00:53.579> felt<00:00:54.449> like<00:00:54.860> connected<00:00:55.860> with<00:00:55.980> my

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
really felt like connected with my

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.000 
really felt like connected with my
personality<00:00:56.780> but<00:00:57.780> it<00:00:57.899> wasn't<00:00:58.199> very<00:00:58.350> practical

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
personality but it wasn't very practical

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.150 
personality but it wasn't very practical
for<00:00:59.039> the<00:00:59.309> working<00:00:59.699> environment<00:01:00.480> and<00:01:00.690> I<00:01:01.160> just

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
for the working environment and I just

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.340 
for the working environment and I just
recently<00:01:02.579> graduated<00:01:02.730> from<00:01:03.239> UC<00:01:03.570> Irvine<00:01:03.600> like<00:01:04.320> a

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
recently graduated from UC Irvine like a

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.250 
recently graduated from UC Irvine like a
few<00:01:04.650> weeks<00:01:04.739> ago<00:01:04.949> so<00:01:05.909> I've<00:01:06.240> been<00:01:06.510> kind<00:01:07.170> of

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260 
few weeks ago so I've been kind of

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.530 
few weeks ago so I've been kind of
hunting<00:01:07.650> for<00:01:08.070> a<00:01:08.130> job<00:01:08.369> right<00:01:08.670> now<00:01:08.700> and<00:01:08.850> I<00:01:09.510> just

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:09.540 
hunting for a job right now and I just

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.170 
hunting for a job right now and I just
thought<00:01:09.930> maybe<00:01:10.159> if<00:01:11.159> I<00:01:11.810> went<00:01:12.810> for<00:01:13.020> a<00:01:13.049> more

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:14.180 
thought maybe if I went for a more

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.670 
thought maybe if I went for a more
practical<00:01:15.180> hair<00:01:15.420> color<00:01:15.689> maybe<00:01:16.080> my<00:01:16.229> chances

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
practical hair color maybe my chances

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.700 
practical hair color maybe my chances
would<00:01:16.860> be<00:01:16.920> better<00:01:17.430> especially<00:01:17.790> that<00:01:18.330> I'm

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:18.710 
would be better especially that I'm

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.670 
would be better especially that I'm
looking<00:01:19.710> for<00:01:20.340> a<00:01:20.369> position<00:01:20.549> the<00:01:20.970> bio<00:01:21.210> fields<00:01:21.780> it

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
looking for a position the bio fields it

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.200 
looking for a position the bio fields it
would<00:01:22.799> probably<00:01:22.979> benefit<00:01:23.640> me<00:01:23.700> to<00:01:23.970> have<00:01:24.180> a

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
would probably benefit me to have a

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.569 
would probably benefit me to have a
normal<00:01:25.369> normal<00:01:26.369> looking<00:01:26.670> hair<00:01:26.880> color<00:01:27.150> so<00:01:28.579> as
