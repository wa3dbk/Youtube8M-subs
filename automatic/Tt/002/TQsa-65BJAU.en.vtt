00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:11.370
 and what we ask 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:16.410
 Agustin 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.789
 hello everyone I'm football tricks 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.330
 online and today I'm going to show you the 

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:20.330
 next trick 

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:24.830
 and 

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:34.270
 and there is no doubt 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.480
 same 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.930
 now it is the next 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:53.000
 early 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.410
 ok you know that lately I'm 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.149
 uploading some tricks invented by me 

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:57.739
 simply practicing or inventing 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:00:59.290
 new things I like it 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:01.190
 you make them to practice them 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:02.719
 practicing this trick did not come and the 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:04.940
 it's really great and I think that 

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:06.290
 can be very effective in football 11 already 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.729
 that when he does it the ball goes out to 

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:10.009
 a very fast speed and the opponent 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:12.110
 we do not even realize what we're going to do 

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:13.909
 is the next thing we're going to step on the ball 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.740
 with the dominant foot we're going to 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:17.899
 drag back we carry 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.670
 lift with the tip of the foot like that ok 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:22.100
 is the first step as in many other 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.570
 tricks just roll and lift in 

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:26.119
 this case we will not raise it very 

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.820
 high simply at knee level 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:29.470
 more or less 

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:31.300
 one thing that may be confusing 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:32.860
 when we raise you have to hit him 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:36.700
 when the ball goes up do not wait for 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:38.410
 rise and when I get off lp as soon as it's already 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.060
 you have to hit him or she has to 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:42.700
 make a very fast move as well 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.110
 the rise you already support he has the floor and 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.210
 right away but do knee or something 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:48.190
 A) Yes 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:50.110
 if we raise it too low we're going to 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:51.610
 hit with the part below the knee and 

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.530
 that's going to make the ball vote 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.470
 on the floor then maybe in some 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:58.060
 occasion serve us but would not be ideal 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:59.619
 on the other hand it has risen very high 

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.640
 what will happen to us is that we are going to 

00:01:59.619 --> 00:02:02.500
 paste with the top of the 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:04.150
 knee or with a bit of the world it 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.979
 could you say no then what's going to happen 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:07.950
 this time is that the ball instead 

00:02:05.979 --> 00:02:10.479
 direct is strong will go slowly 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.250
 and pumped up a little 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.040
 then that will not surprise the 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.019
 opponent then 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:17.819
 to do this correctly and ideally 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:19.650
 would be that you hit with the bone of the 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:21.989
 knee right in the middle then it 's 

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.400
 practice lifting it to a level where it 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:25.920
 you can hit just with the bone and that the 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.959
 ball comes out strong in speed is more 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.519
 or less like hitting a puntinazo 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:31.349
 the ball already know that when he hits 

00:02:29.519 --> 00:02:32.939
 tiptoe to the ball comes out to a super 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:35.489
 speed and that what we want to do 

00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:37.019
 but with the knee then we practice 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:39.709
 that raising to a level that we can 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:39.709
 hit with the knee 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.160
 there are variants of this trick what can you 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.150
 do for any direction by 

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.040
 example if you want to go there 

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:47.840
 just as I say in the video what 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:49.670
 We raise and hit him on his side to 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:50.960
 let it go in speed and we want it 

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:52.550
 stands in front of you has simply lifted 

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:54.050
 more in front of you and we hit a 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:55.460
 kneed to the front and then to 

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:57.140
 You can also move the last 

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:58.910
 knee a little to the outside to 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.740
 throw it over there the most comfortable you 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:03.110
 come where you can use and what's more 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:04.940
 is likely to be very effective little to 

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:06.710
 all and the opponent more or less with the 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.390
 body and inadvertently show you towards 

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:09.860
 where will the defender or the 

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:11.240
 opponent then if the opponent knows 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:13.010
 defend well more or less realize 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:14.300
 where will it come from but vice versa 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.920
 with this trick we can cheat 

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:17.630
 quite more than anything because first 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.040
 let's lift the ball and the opponent 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:20.750
 is going to say he does this by raising the 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:22.520
 over the ball and then gets into a 

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:24.370
 knee and the ball will come out super 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:27.140
 speed and we're going to surprise you a lot 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:29.750
 even though this trick has steps 

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:31.430
 very simple do not think it's all 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:32.840
 easy more than anything because you have to 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:34.550
 have a good coordination you have to 

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:36.560
 practice the height of the ball 

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:39.520
 perfect for it to go well and hit 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.520
 well with the knee bone 

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:45.530
 and 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.620
 d 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:57.890
 Well, people have not said it for a long time 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:59.299

 the tricks and doing some tutorials 

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:06.660
 phenomenal with opponents

 video as the description of the video and 

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:19.260
 now to finish is a mega throw a 

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:21.530
 criminal and most likely not what 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.530
 goal 

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.970
 yes
