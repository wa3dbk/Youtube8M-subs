00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.330 
we're going to cover is the measurement
of<00:00:44.640> the<00:00:44.850> output<00:00:45.360> shaft<00:00:45.570> the<00:00:46.260> turbo<00:00:46.590> 400<00:00:46.830> had

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
of the output shaft the turbo 400 had

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.720 
of the output shaft the turbo 400 had
three<00:00:47.790> different<00:00:48.300> output<00:00:48.750> shaft<00:00:49.020> links<00:00:49.470> and

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:49.730 
three different output shaft links and

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:53.119 
three different output shaft links and
it<00:00:50.730> rains<00:00:51.059> anywhere<00:00:51.510> from<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:51.780> early<00:00:52.080> 60s<00:00:52.290> all

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129

it rains anywhere from the early 60s all
the<00:00:53.400> way<00:00:53.489> up<00:00:53.610> into<00:00:53.790> the<00:00:54.000> 90s<00:00:54.239> and<00:00:54.720> they<00:00:54.900> ran

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
the way up into the 90s and they ran

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.439 
the way up into the 90s and they ran
different<00:00:55.710> output<00:00:56.070> shaft<00:00:56.309> lengths<00:00:56.760> they<00:00:57.300> are

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
different output shaft lengths they are

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.080 
different output shaft lengths they are
all<00:00:57.720> three<00:00:58.170> of<00:00:58.290> them<00:00:58.470> have<00:00:58.710> 32<00:00:59.280> spline<00:00:59.760> teeth

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:00.090 
all three of them have 32 spline teeth

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:03.740 
all three of them have 32 spline teeth
as<00:01:00.360> you<00:01:00.840> can<00:01:00.989> see<00:01:01.170> they<00:01:01.379> all<00:01:01.500> have<00:01:01.650> 32<00:01:02.129> T<00:01:02.750> and

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
as you can see they all have 32 T and

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.299 
as you can see they all have 32 T and
there's<00:01:03.930> different<00:01:04.140> length<00:01:04.650> shafts<00:01:04.979> I'm

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
there's different length shafts I'm

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.270 
there's different length shafts I'm
going<00:01:05.489> to<00:01:05.550> show<00:01:05.610> you<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:05.820> correct<00:01:06.180> method<00:01:06.810> of

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:07.280 
going to show you the correct method of

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.460 
going to show you the correct method of
measuring<00:01:08.280> the<00:01:08.490> output<00:01:08.640> shaft<00:01:09.090> now<00:01:09.960> obviously

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
measuring the output shaft now obviously

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.110 
measuring the output shaft now obviously
this<00:01:10.620> transmission<00:01:11.159> is<00:01:11.250> out<00:01:11.460> of<00:01:11.610> the<00:01:11.670> vehicle

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:12.120 
this transmission is out of the vehicle

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.020 
this transmission is out of the vehicle
the<00:01:12.510> transfer<00:01:12.960> case<00:01:13.170> and<00:01:13.350> adapter<00:01:14.040> removed<00:01:14.159> we

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
the transfer case and adapter removed we

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:16.640 
the transfer case and adapter removed we
need<00:01:15.150> a<00:01:15.210> measurement<00:01:15.690> from<00:01:15.900> the<00:01:16.049> casting<00:01:16.560> of

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
need a measurement from the casting of

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:19.070 
need a measurement from the casting of
the<00:01:16.770> case<00:01:17.010> to<00:01:17.940> the<00:01:18.060> end<00:01:18.240> of<00:01:18.420> the<00:01:18.510> output<00:01:18.870> shaft

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
the case to the end of the output shaft

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.219 
the case to the end of the output shaft
so<00:01:20.040> basically<00:01:20.340> what<00:01:20.520> you<00:01:20.610> do<00:01:20.760> to<00:01:20.970> place<00:01:21.780> a<00:01:21.810> flat

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
so basically what you do to place a flat

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.770 
so basically what you do to place a flat
item<00:01:22.680> let's<00:01:22.890> say<00:01:23.040> a<00:01:23.070> ruler<00:01:23.340> flat<00:01:24.330> surface

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
item let's say a ruler flat surface

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.620 
item let's say a ruler flat surface
flush<00:01:25.530> with<00:01:25.799> the<00:01:25.920> end<00:01:26.070> of<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.280> shaft<00:01:26.549> and<00:01:26.820> then

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
flush with the end of the shaft and then

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.570 
flush with the end of the shaft and then
what<00:01:27.810> you<00:01:27.930> will<00:01:28.020> do<00:01:28.170> is<00:01:28.320> you'll<00:01:28.470> measure<00:01:28.710> from

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:29.580 
what you will do is you'll measure from

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.510 
what you will do is you'll measure from
the<00:01:29.760> surface<00:01:30.210> of<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:31.170> edge<00:01:31.320> of<00:01:31.530> the<00:01:31.590> case<00:01:31.920> not

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:32.520 
the surface of the edge of the case not

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.670 
the surface of the edge of the case not
the<00:01:32.700> adapter<00:01:33.119> plate<00:01:33.330> put<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.570> case<00:01:33.810> to<00:01:34.560> the

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
the adapter plate put the case to the

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.319 
the adapter plate put the case to the
end<00:01:34.859> of<00:01:35.039> the<00:01:35.100> shaft<00:01:35.369> and<00:01:35.700> this<00:01:35.969> one<00:01:36.149> here

00:01:36.319 --> 00:01:36.329 
end of the shaft and this one here

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:38.870 
end of the shaft and this one here
measures<00:01:36.539> approximately<00:01:37.039> and<00:01:38.039> just<00:01:38.520> over<00:01:38.789> an

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
measures approximately and just over an

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.330 
measures approximately and just over an
inch<00:01:38.969> and<00:01:39.210> a<00:01:39.240> half<00:01:39.270> like<00:01:39.689> an<00:01:39.810> inch<00:01:39.960> and<00:01:40.079> 3/4<00:01:40.680> so

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
inch and a half like an inch and 3/4 so

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.849 
inch and a half like an inch and 3/4 so
this<00:01:42.000> is<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.270> length<00:01:42.509> of<00:01:42.719> the<00:01:42.899> short<00:01:43.259> shaft<00:01:43.619> on

00:01:43.849 --> 00:01:43.859 
this is the length of the short shaft on

00:01:43.859 --> 00:01:46.249 
this is the length of the short shaft on
the<00:01:43.979> turbo<00:01:44.280> 400<00:01:44.659> we're<00:01:45.659> going<00:01:45.780> to<00:01:45.840> go<00:01:45.960> over<00:01:46.170> the

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
the turbo 400 we're going to go over the

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.880 
the turbo 400 we're going to go over the
measurement<00:01:46.770> of<00:01:47.030> the<00:01:48.030> next<00:01:48.990> shaft<00:01:49.380> that's

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
measurement of the next shaft that's

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.599 
measurement of the next shaft that's
available<00:01:50.640> in<00:01:51.060> a<00:01:51.149> turbo<00:01:51.390> 400<00:01:52.070> this<00:01:53.070> shaft<00:01:53.340> is

00:01:53.599 --> 00:01:53.609 
available in a turbo 400 this shaft is

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:57.319 
available in a turbo 400 this shaft is
about<00:01:54.119> an<00:01:54.329> inch<00:01:54.539> longer<00:01:55.789> to<00:01:56.789> measure<00:01:57.030> it

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
about an inch longer to measure it

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:04.410 
about an inch longer to measure it
obviously<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.079> exact<00:01:58.439> same<00:01:58.770> way

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:04.420 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.090 

flat<00:02:05.420> surface<00:02:05.990> again<00:02:06.380> you<00:02:06.500> measure<00:02:06.710> from<00:02:06.920> the

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
flat surface again you measure from the

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.040 
flat surface again you measure from the
flange<00:02:07.490> or<00:02:07.790> the<00:02:07.850> outside<00:02:08.030> edge<00:02:08.479> of<00:02:08.690> the<00:02:08.810> case

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
flange or the outside edge of the case

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:12.610 
flange or the outside edge of the case
to<00:02:09.890> the<00:02:10.010> end<00:02:10.220> of<00:02:10.550> the<00:02:11.180> shaft<00:02:11.450> and<00:02:11.720> that

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
to the end of the shaft and that

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.080 
to the end of the shaft and that
measurement<00:02:13.010> is<00:02:13.310> about<00:02:13.580> two<00:02:13.880> and<00:02:14.000> a<00:02:14.060> half

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:14.090 
measurement is about two and a half

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.990 
measurement is about two and a half
inches<00:02:14.600> so<00:02:15.530> this<00:02:15.890> is<00:02:16.040> roughly<00:02:16.310> an<00:02:16.430> inch<00:02:16.580> longer

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
inches so this is roughly an inch longer

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.840 
inches so this is roughly an inch longer
than<00:02:17.360> the<00:02:17.930> short<00:02:18.200> shaft<00:02:18.470> this<00:02:19.190> is<00:02:19.400> actually

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:19.850 
than the short shaft this is actually

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:22.720 
than the short shaft this is actually
the<00:02:20.000> most<00:02:20.270> common<00:02:20.860> four<00:02:21.860> by<00:02:22.010> four<00:02:22.280> output

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
the most common four by four output

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.120 
the most common four by four output
shaft<00:02:22.970> that's<00:02:23.180> in<00:02:23.360> a<00:02:23.390> turbo<00:02:23.750> 400<00:02:23.990> and<00:02:24.500> then

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130 
shaft that's in a turbo 400 and then

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:27.130 
shaft that's in a turbo 400 and then
we'll<00:02:25.250> move<00:02:25.370> on<00:02:25.550> to<00:02:25.580> the<00:02:25.820> last<00:02:26.060> one<00:02:26.390> this<00:02:26.870> one's

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:27.140 
we'll move on to the last one this one's
