 short is the reggina bathtub for this 

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:46.340
 period 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.980
 of our racing season 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.890
 athletes for who employ the 

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:52.880
 most of their time in 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.430
 short tank training though 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.790
 many are already starting to think about the tub 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:57.530
 long 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:59.750
 really the signal that this 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.580
 movement is growing we have become 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:05.380
 big companies have become big 

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:07.550
 to the athletes and therefore it is a first step for 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:10.090
 of approaching these two 

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:15.160
 very important first events 

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:17.910
 European inas fid of August where 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:21.280
 clearly we will try to return 

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.630
 on the continental stage more and more 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.820
 competitive over the years 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:28.500
 there are previous numbers there are 

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:31.580
 new athletes and this bodes well for us 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:34.390
 the same the same thing for the 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:37.190
 worldwide decided where we are 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:39.350
 obviously the special observants we are 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.510
 the first nation of europe is the 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:44.030
 second in the world therefore they wait from 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:47.530
 we saw results in these 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.530
 days also with other colleagues 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:52.409
 the old ones say the old results le 

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:55.319
 old international competitions 

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:57.840
 in the face of a renewal that exists 

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:59.849
 been on our part 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:03.510
 we still see national selections 

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:05.670
 let's say they are still at numbers 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.109
 to elements to athletes of the last years 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:09.239
 so this also bodes well for us 

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:10.739
 because fresh new forces besides 

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:13.019
 be more motivated from the point of view 

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:15.810
 physiological and organic can 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:17.069
 definitely express the best and this 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.620
 will be our strength 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:22.370
 specifically, three records arrived 

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:25.109

 they also constitute an Italian record 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:51.150
 another 11 national records must be added 

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.560

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:54.689
