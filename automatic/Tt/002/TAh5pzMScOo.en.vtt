the<00:00:45.329> answer<00:00:45.660> is<00:00:45.840> I<00:00:47.210> viewed<00:00:48.210> a<00:00:48.269> video<00:00:48.540> on

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:48.690 
the answer is I viewed a video on

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:52.700 
the answer is I viewed a video on
YouTube<00:00:49.080> long<00:00:49.320> time<00:00:49.620> ago<00:00:51.170> the<00:00:52.170> guys<00:00:52.379> name<00:00:52.680> was

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:52.710 
YouTube long time ago the guys name was

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:55.189 
YouTube long time ago the guys name was
man<00:00:53.160> Gus<00:00:53.460> and<00:00:54.120> had<00:00:54.300> some<00:00:54.510> numbers<00:00:54.870> after<00:00:55.019> it

00:00:55.189 --> 00:00:55.199 
man Gus and had some numbers after it

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:58.369 
man Gus and had some numbers after it
I'll<00:00:55.379> try<00:00:55.530> and<00:00:55.710> stick<00:00:55.890> it<00:00:55.980> in<00:00:56.100> here<00:00:56.690> anyway<00:00:57.690> he

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
I'll try and stick it in here anyway he

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.700 
I'll try and stick it in here anyway he
had<00:00:59.150> used<00:01:00.150> some<00:01:00.390> ballpoint<00:01:00.870> hammers<00:01:01.290> and<00:01:01.410> such

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
had used some ballpoint hammers and such

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.249 
had used some ballpoint hammers and such
to<00:01:02.040> try<00:01:02.610> and<00:01:02.730> do<00:01:02.820> the<00:01:02.940> same<00:01:03.120> thing<00:01:03.450> and<00:01:03.750> I

00:01:04.249 --> 00:01:04.259 
to try and do the same thing and I

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:06.889 
to try and do the same thing and I
believe<00:01:04.710> he<00:01:04.890> was<00:01:05.009> successful<00:01:05.670> however<00:01:06.600> I

00:01:06.889 --> 00:01:06.899 
believe he was successful however I

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:09.859 
believe he was successful however I
couldn't<00:01:07.229> replicate<00:01:07.920> it<00:01:08.399> until<00:01:08.700> I<00:01:08.869> created

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
couldn't replicate it until I created

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:13.279 
couldn't replicate it until I created
these<00:01:10.229> two<00:01:11.009> objects<00:01:11.580> these<00:01:12.360> are<00:01:12.570> just<00:01:12.810> two

00:01:13.279 --> 00:01:13.289 
these two objects these are just two

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:15.380 
these two objects these are just two
large<00:01:13.530> dowel<00:01:13.890> rods<00:01:14.190> but<00:01:14.580> some<00:01:14.850> small<00:01:15.180> ones

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
large dowel rods but some small ones

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:16.910 
large dowel rods but some small ones
going<00:01:15.600> through<00:01:15.899> it<00:01:15.990> and<00:01:16.110> I<00:01:16.170> rounded<00:01:16.530> the<00:01:16.649> tips

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
going through it and I rounded the tips

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:20.840 
going through it and I rounded the tips
off<00:01:17.960> this<00:01:18.960> one's<00:01:19.170> a<00:01:19.229> lot<00:01:19.380> more<00:01:19.590> round<00:01:19.860> this<00:01:20.700> one

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:20.850 
off this one's a lot more round this one

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.999 
off this one's a lot more round this one
has<00:01:21.030> a<00:01:21.060> bit<00:01:21.240> more<00:01:21.420> of<00:01:21.479> a<00:01:21.570> point<00:01:21.920> typically<00:01:22.920> I

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
has a bit more of a point typically I

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.560 
has a bit more of a point typically I
would<00:01:23.250> try<00:01:23.460> and<00:01:23.520> get<00:01:23.700> it<00:01:23.820> started<00:01:24.060> with<00:01:24.420> this

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
would try and get it started with this

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.410 
would try and get it started with this
one<00:01:24.780> and<00:01:25.080> then<00:01:25.320> switch<00:01:25.649> over<00:01:26.090> in<00:01:27.090> the<00:01:27.270> process

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
one and then switch over in the process

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.469 
one and then switch over in the process
of<00:01:27.930> making<00:01:28.110> mine<00:01:28.500> I<00:01:28.830> did<00:01:29.280> ruin<00:01:29.550> about<00:01:29.850> three<00:01:30.330> of

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
of making mine I did ruin about three of

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:31.999 
of making mine I did ruin about three of
them<00:01:30.600> some<00:01:31.050> of<00:01:31.170> them<00:01:31.320> I<00:01:31.410> made<00:01:31.590> it<00:01:31.710> all<00:01:31.860> the<00:01:31.979> way

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
them some of them I made it all the way

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.190 
them some of them I made it all the way
up<00:01:32.220> to<00:01:32.429> the<00:01:32.550> last<00:01:32.729> ridge<00:01:33.119> that<00:01:33.420> I<00:01:33.509> was<00:01:33.660> creating

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:34.200 
up to the last ridge that I was creating

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.660 
up to the last ridge that I was creating
and<00:01:35.659> punched<00:01:36.659> this<00:01:36.900> right<00:01:37.200> through<00:01:37.670> punched

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
and punched this right through punched

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.480 
and punched this right through punched
this<00:01:38.820> thing<00:01:39.119> right<00:01:39.330> through<00:01:39.689> the<00:01:40.080> can<00:01:40.490> by

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
this thing right through the can by

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.570 
this thing right through the can by
pushing<00:01:41.790> too<00:01:41.939> hard

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:43.580 
pushing too hard

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:48.530 
pushing too hard
what<00:01:44.580> I<00:01:44.610> do<00:01:44.729> is<00:01:45.060> basically<00:01:45.439> it<00:01:46.439> just<00:01:47.540> fits

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
what I do is basically it just fits

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:49.429 
what I do is basically it just fits
right<00:01:48.659> in<00:01:49.020> there

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
right in there

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:51.590 
right in there
not<00:01:50.130> a<00:01:50.159> lot<00:01:50.369> of<00:01:50.490> space<00:01:50.759> so<00:01:50.790> that<00:01:51.060> I<00:01:51.240> don't<00:01:51.450> have

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
not a lot of space so that I don't have

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.289 
not a lot of space so that I don't have
to<00:01:51.810> pry<00:01:52.140> much<00:01:52.409> pressure<00:01:52.740> but<00:01:53.490> I<00:01:53.520> pull<00:01:53.820> back<00:01:53.850> on

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
to pry much pressure but I pull back on

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.149 
to pry much pressure but I pull back on
it<00:01:54.329> slightly<00:01:54.750> which<00:01:55.320> pushes<00:01:55.619> it<00:01:55.860> into<00:01:56.070> the

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
it slightly which pushes it into the

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.310 
it slightly which pushes it into the
other<00:01:56.280> wall<00:01:56.579> and<00:01:57.479> then<00:01:57.600> I<00:01:57.689> just<00:01:57.960> roll<00:01:58.170> it

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
other wall and then I just roll it

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.060 
other wall and then I just roll it
against<00:01:58.710> my<00:01:58.860> hand<00:01:59.869> over<00:02:00.869> and<00:02:00.990> over<00:02:01.259> again<00:02:01.380> now

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
against my hand over and over again now

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.530 
against my hand over and over again now
I<00:02:02.100> make<00:02:02.399> the<00:02:02.430> passes<00:02:02.970> go<00:02:03.119> the<00:02:03.270> whole<00:02:03.420> way

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
I make the passes go the whole way

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:04.700 
I make the passes go the whole way
around<00:02:03.659> I'm<00:02:04.049> just<00:02:04.079> doing<00:02:04.530> this<00:02:04.649> for

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
around I'm just doing this for

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.199 
around I'm just doing this for
demonstration<00:02:05.990> purposes<00:02:07.640> I'm<00:02:08.640> not<00:02:08.910> trying<00:02:09.149> to

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
demonstration purposes I'm not trying to

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:14.330 
demonstration purposes I'm not trying to
make<00:02:09.360> another<00:02:09.660> canned<00:02:09.989> right<00:02:10.200> now<00:02:10.380> I<00:02:13.340> just

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
make another canned right now I just

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:16.160 
make another canned right now I just
want<00:02:14.519> to<00:02:14.610> try<00:02:14.760> and<00:02:14.790> get<00:02:15.090> one<00:02:15.120> ridge<00:02:15.540> pushed<00:02:15.930> out

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:16.170 
want to try and get one ridge pushed out

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:24.860 
want to try and get one ridge pushed out
here<00:02:16.470> a<00:02:16.910> little<00:02:17.910> bit<00:02:18.180> so<00:02:20.000> you<00:02:21.000> guys<00:02:21.150> can<00:02:21.420> see

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.840 

don't<00:02:25.870> know<00:02:26.050> if<00:02:26.170> you<00:02:26.290> can<00:02:26.440> see<00:02:26.620> that<00:02:26.850> hopefully

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:27.850 
don't know if you can see that hopefully

00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:33.360 
don't know if you can see that hopefully
you<00:02:28.240> can<00:02:30.360> start<00:02:31.360> at<00:02:31.450> the<00:02:31.540> ridge<00:02:31.750> there<00:02:32.190> now<00:02:33.190> if

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
you can start at the ridge there now if

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.940 
you can start at the ridge there now if
I<00:02:33.460> take<00:02:33.730> that<00:02:33.940> the<00:02:34.120> whole<00:02:34.270> way<00:02:34.420> around<00:02:34.950> several

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
I take that the whole way around several

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.330 
I take that the whole way around several
times<00:02:36.100> up<00:02:37.000> and<00:02:37.270> down<00:02:37.390> the<00:02:37.570> can<00:02:37.860> I'll<00:02:38.860> have<00:02:39.130> some

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:39.340 
times up and down the can I'll have some

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:44.250 
times up and down the can I'll have some
ridges<00:02:39.730> that's<00:02:40.240> the<00:02:40.480> inside<00:02:41.760> now<00:02:42.760> I<00:02:43.120> did<00:02:44.050> have

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:44.260 
ridges that's the inside now I did have

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.280 
ridges that's the inside now I did have
some<00:02:44.500> problems<00:02:45.040> with<00:02:45.270> it<00:02:46.270> scratching<00:02:46.990> up<00:02:47.110> the

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
some problems with it scratching up the

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:49.470 
some problems with it scratching up the
inside<00:02:47.710> of<00:02:47.860> the<00:02:47.950> cans<00:02:48.220> after<00:02:48.940> a<00:02:48.970> while<00:02:49.180> with

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:49.480 
inside of the cans after a while with

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:51.720 
inside of the cans after a while with
too<00:02:49.660> much<00:02:49.870> pressure<00:02:50.200> so<00:02:51.190> what<00:02:51.340> it<00:02:51.430> ended<00:02:51.640> up

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
too much pressure so what it ended up

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.760 
too much pressure so what it ended up
doing<00:02:52.060> was<00:02:52.390> just<00:02:52.420> wrapping<00:02:52.930> a<00:02:53.170> piece<00:02:53.350> of<00:02:53.530> felt

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:53.770 
doing was just wrapping a piece of felt

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:56.610 
doing was just wrapping a piece of felt
the<00:02:54.130> whole<00:02:54.910> way<00:02:55.060> around<00:02:55.390> and<00:02:55.720> holding<00:02:56.410> it<00:02:56.500> in

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:56.620 
the whole way around and holding it in

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.670 
the whole way around and holding it in
my<00:02:56.650> hand<00:02:57.010> which<00:02:57.220> made<00:02:58.120> a<00:02:58.150> real<00:02:58.420> nice<00:02:59.140> slick

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
my hand which made a real nice slick

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.550 
my hand which made a real nice slick
surface<00:03:00.430> which<00:03:01.420> didn't<00:03:01.780> damage<00:03:01.960> the<00:03:02.140> inside

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:02.560 
surface which didn't damage the inside

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.710 
surface which didn't damage the inside
of<00:03:02.710> the<00:03:02.800> can<00:03:02.980> that<00:03:03.160> I<00:03:03.250> have<00:03:03.490> it<00:03:03.640> all<00:03:03.790> I<00:03:04.030> do

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
of the can that I have it all I do

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.900 
of the can that I have it all I do
eventually<00:03:05.110> plan<00:03:05.470> on<00:03:05.620> making<00:03:05.920> some<00:03:06.100> more<00:03:06.250> just

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
eventually plan on making some more just

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:17.670 
eventually plan on making some more just
not<00:03:07.090> right<00:03:07.300> now<00:03:07.980> thanks<00:03:08.980> for<00:03:09.010> watching
