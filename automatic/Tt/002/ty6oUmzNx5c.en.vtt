00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:08.720 

I<00:00:00.089> think<00:00:00.599> fits<00:00:00.810> right<00:00:01.020> in<00:00:01.170> the<00:00:01.230> frame<00:00:01.560> to<00:00:07.730> use

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:08.730 
I think fits right in the frame to use

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:10.640 
I think fits right in the frame to use
in<00:00:08.880> the<00:00:08.940> black<00:00:09.179> work

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:10.650 
in the black work

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:25.790 
in the black work
we<00:00:11.460> feature<00:00:15.770> on<00:00:16.770> this<00:00:24.140> mostess<00:00:25.140> frames<00:00:25.470> off

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
we feature on this mostess frames off

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.190 
we feature on this mostess frames off
right<00:00:26.160> here<00:00:26.400> you<00:00:27.029> can<00:00:27.210> tell<00:00:27.239> by<00:00:27.599> looking<00:00:27.960> at<00:00:28.050> if

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:28.200 
right here you can tell by looking at if

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.680 
right here you can tell by looking at if
you<00:00:28.320> look<00:00:28.470> straight<00:00:28.619> down<00:00:29.390> it<00:00:30.390> is<00:00:30.890> crooked<00:00:31.890> I

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:32.690 
you look straight down it is crooked I

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:36.350 
you look straight down it is crooked I
think<00:00:33.690> it's<00:00:33.840> why<00:00:33.960> they<00:00:34.140> sold<00:00:34.440> it<00:00:34.590> to<00:00:34.649> me<00:00:35.360> so

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
think it's why they sold it to me so

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:41.870 
think it's why they sold it to me so
cheap<00:00:38.390> but<00:00:39.390> you<00:00:39.780> can<00:00:39.930> see<00:00:40.170> how<00:00:40.350> it<00:00:40.640> over<00:00:41.640> a

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:41.880 
cheap but you can see how it over a

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:46.189 
cheap but you can see how it over a
little<00:00:42.660> bit<00:00:42.809> is<00:00:44.030> per<00:00:45.030> kid<00:00:45.239> right<00:00:45.449> here<00:00:45.629> we<00:00:45.960> tell

00:00:46.189 --> 00:00:46.199 
little bit is per kid right here we tell

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:50.900 
little bit is per kid right here we tell
by<00:00:46.320> looking<00:00:46.649> at<00:00:46.769> it<00:00:46.949> I<00:00:49.309> got<00:00:50.309> this<00:00:50.429> winning<00:00:50.760> arm

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
by looking at it I got this winning arm

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:55.459 
by looking at it I got this winning arm
on<00:00:51.149> there<00:00:52.070> because<00:00:53.070> now<00:00:53.519> I<00:00:54.050> actually<00:00:55.050> work<00:00:55.350> a

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
on there because now I actually work a

00:00:55.469 --> 00:01:05.120 
on there because now I actually work a
lot<00:00:55.739> better<00:00:55.949> and<00:00:56.249> I<00:00:56.309> thought<00:00:56.640> it<00:00:56.789> was

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:05.130 

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:08.370 

actually<00:01:06.130> straightening<00:01:06.580> frame<00:01:06.790> up<00:01:07.060> to<00:01:07.380> see

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:08.380 
actually straightening frame up to see

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.470 
actually straightening frame up to see
it's<00:01:08.500> a<00:01:08.620> lot<00:01:08.950> straighter<00:01:09.430> this<00:01:09.730> time<00:01:09.970> it<00:01:10.300> was

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:10.480 
it's a lot straighter this time it was

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:28.200 
it's a lot straighter this time it was
creepy

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:28.210 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.780

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:33.710 
fabricating the shocks there underneath

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:35.940 
fabricating the shocks there underneath
the<00:01:34.040> suspension

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
the suspension

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.359

as<00:01:36.100> you<00:01:36.250> can<00:01:36.340> tell<00:01:36.400> I'm<00:01:36.820> a<00:01:36.970> well-known<00:01:37.479> of

00:01:38.359 --> 00:01:38.369 
as you can tell I'm a well-known of

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:47.290 
as you can tell I'm a well-known of
keeping<00:01:39.369> hanging<00:01:39.610> levels<00:01:39.939> now

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:47.300 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:51.830 

fiving<00:01:48.300> up<00:01:48.390> the<00:01:48.510> front<00:01:48.750> motor<00:01:48.930> mount<00:01:49.260> now<00:01:50.840> in

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
fiving up the front motor mount now in

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.710 
fiving up the front motor mount now in
the<00:01:52.020> front<00:01:52.380> so<00:01:53.010> let's<00:01:53.340> get<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:53.640> size<00:01:53.940> of<00:01:54.270> it<00:01:54.450> I

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:54.720 
the front so let's get the size of it I

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:58.670 
the front so let's get the size of it I
got<00:01:55.409> a<00:01:55.440> problem<00:01:55.770> here<00:01:56.630> this<00:01:57.630> engine<00:01:58.229> is

00:01:58.670 --> 00:01:58.680 
got a problem here this engine is

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.160 
got a problem here this engine is
getting<00:01:59.190> way<00:01:59.430> too<00:01:59.490> close<00:02:00.150> this<00:02:00.479> frame<00:02:00.869> and<00:02:00.900> I

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
getting way too close this frame and I

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.530 
getting way too close this frame and I
know<00:02:01.260> it<00:02:01.650> raises<00:02:02.070> up<00:02:02.310> when<00:02:02.940> you<00:02:03.030> give<00:02:03.210> it<00:02:03.270> a<00:02:03.330> gas

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
know it raises up when you give it a gas

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:07.160 
know it raises up when you give it a gas
I've<00:02:04.170> seen<00:02:04.470> it<00:02:04.590> shake<00:02:04.860> before<00:02:05.130> and<00:02:06.090> I<00:02:06.900> can't

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
I've seen it shake before and I can't

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.690 
I've seen it shake before and I can't
really<00:02:07.290> do<00:02:07.470> anything<00:02:07.650> with<00:02:07.800> the<00:02:08.009> fact<00:02:08.340> with

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
really do anything with the fact with

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.960 
really do anything with the fact with
mounted<00:02:09.300> I<00:02:09.600> can't<00:02:10.470> lower<00:02:10.770> because<00:02:11.310> the<00:02:11.370> frame

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:11.970 
mounted I can't lower because the frame

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:16.600 
mounted I can't lower because the frame
is<00:02:12.000> touching<00:02:12.630> the<00:02:12.720> frame<00:02:13.080> so<00:02:13.500> I'll<00:02:14.160> have<00:02:14.640> to

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:16.610 
is touching the frame so I'll have to

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:26.990 
is touching the frame so I'll have to
toes<00:02:17.610> and<00:02:18.180> raise<00:02:18.480> them<00:02:18.690> up<00:02:25.610> actually<00:02:26.610> has<00:02:26.970> a

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
toes and raise them up actually has a

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.460 
toes and raise them up actually has a
motor<00:02:27.269> back<00:02:27.510> into<00:02:28.019> the<00:02:28.320> frame<00:02:28.769> now<00:02:29.160> which

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
motor back into the frame now which

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:34.190 
motor back into the frame now which
actually<00:02:31.470> have<00:02:31.739> more<00:02:32.459> clearance<00:02:33.330> there<00:02:33.690> not

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
actually have more clearance there not

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.520 
actually have more clearance there not
as<00:02:34.380> much<00:02:34.590> as<00:02:34.709> I<00:02:34.830> thought<00:02:35.100> it<00:02:35.280> would<00:02:35.489> be<00:02:35.880> a<00:02:36.530> lot

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:37.530 
as much as I thought it would be a lot

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.030 
as much as I thought it would be a lot
more<00:02:37.769> clearance<00:02:39.170> going<00:02:40.170> there<00:02:40.350> now<00:02:40.620> than<00:02:40.830> what

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
more clearance going there now than what

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:43.400 
more clearance going there now than what
it<00:02:41.160> was<00:02:41.430> actually<00:02:42.209> raised<00:02:42.690> to<00:02:42.840> the<00:02:42.959> engine<00:02:43.260> up

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
it was actually raised to the engine up

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:45.560 
it was actually raised to the engine up
to<00:02:43.440> just<00:02:44.100> a<00:02:44.280> hair<00:02:44.700> and<00:02:45.000> I<00:02:45.180> thought<00:02:45.360> maybe

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:45.570 
to just a hair and I thought maybe

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:48.350 
to just a hair and I thought maybe
hitting<00:02:45.959> the<00:02:46.080> frame
