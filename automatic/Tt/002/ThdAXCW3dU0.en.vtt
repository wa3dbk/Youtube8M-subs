00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:47.900 
the floor I'm gonna put latch here
between<00:00:45.629> the<00:00:45.809> beams<00:00:46.260> to<00:00:46.739> make<00:00:46.890> sure<00:00:47.100> that<00:00:47.340> the

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
between the beams to make sure that the

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.760 
between the beams to make sure that the
floor<00:00:48.120> is<00:00:48.180> even<00:00:48.420> so<00:00:48.960> I<00:00:49.020> need<00:00:49.230> to<00:00:49.350> adjust<00:00:49.440> a

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:49.770 
floor is even so I need to adjust a

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:51.770 
floor is even so I need to adjust a
little<00:00:49.890> more<00:00:50.160> you<00:00:50.280> see<00:00:50.460> there's<00:00:50.690> there's<00:00:51.690> a

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:51.780 
little more you see there's there's a

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.920 
little more you see there's there's a
bit<00:00:51.930> of<00:00:52.079> a<00:00:52.920> difference<00:00:53.699> there<00:00:53.910> in<00:00:54.570> terms<00:00:54.809> of

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:54.930 
bit of a difference there in terms of

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:55.880 
bit of a difference there in terms of
the<00:00:55.050> level<00:00:55.289> might<00:00:55.440> be<00:00:55.559> one<00:00:55.710> or<00:00:55.860> two

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:55.890 
the level might be one or two

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.540 
the level might be one or two
millimeters<00:00:57.320> so<00:00:58.320> this<00:00:58.469> is<00:00:58.649> this<00:00:59.160> is<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.399> back

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
millimeters so this is this is the back

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.630 
millimeters so this is this is the back
wall<00:00:59.879> here<00:01:02.539> you<00:01:03.539> see<00:01:03.750> it's<00:01:03.899> gonna<00:01:04.019> sit<00:01:04.260> on<00:01:04.290> legs

00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:04.640 
wall here you see it's gonna sit on legs

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.770 
wall here you see it's gonna sit on legs
so<00:01:05.640> it's<00:01:05.760> gonna<00:01:05.850> have<00:01:06.060> a<00:01:06.090> sort<00:01:06.450> of<00:01:06.479> a<00:01:06.600> little

so it's gonna have a sort of a little

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:17.990 
so it's gonna have a sort of a little
luck<00:01:14.689> so<00:01:15.689> that's<00:01:15.840> gonna<00:01:15.990> be<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.170> back<00:01:16.820> this<00:01:17.820> is

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
luck so that's gonna be the back this is

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.929 
luck so that's gonna be the back this is
the<00:01:18.030> front<00:01:18.680> it's<00:01:19.680> gonna<00:01:19.799> be<00:01:20.009> sloped<00:01:20.369> so<00:01:20.820> you

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939
