00:00:15.189 --> 00:00:16.230
 European deputy 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.640
 I believe in it and it's gone 

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:24.730
 we left with Belgium the green right for 100 th sale to make it go 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:29.530
 simple but that's it makes me laugh random so it's done now for 

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:30.649
 Roman Bausch 

00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:36.050
 now that we hear in the racket analyzing the left stick to the left 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.859
 because that's for sure that we're asking him the right analogy to the right 

00:00:39.859 --> 00:00:42.859
 misunderstandings golden globes with the right hand 

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:47.820
 little float it's very interesting some players down the 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.590
 joystick that's little float 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:53.590
 it's not every day that to succeed 

00:00:55.060 --> 00:00:56.680
 here 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:00.050
 after now but we will direct the curation it will be further removed 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:03.250
 of your controller and we will do the same thing except that it is 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.690
 totally different attention down fox movies or others we go to cart 

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:09.930
 hell 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.590
 patience the moving article Copts and in the company of its interesting for 

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.680
 eliminate any player if you have a day admitted as the said role 

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:18.550
 in the back 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:20.550
 bob parker 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:22.740
 neighbor for kenneth merten 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.119
 now she the idea is no longer this one left he has to do it 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.759
 it's a big double-lane shot he supports his double exactly 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.890
 the same on the second disease support like that was actually I search the 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:37.900
 contact 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.980
 this is the second time it allows to provoke faults 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.420
 prices up here is close up w 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.030
 it is obvious that this 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.810
 it allows to easily put between two opponents for the moment 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:54.360
 that's how it's beautiful 

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:01.110
