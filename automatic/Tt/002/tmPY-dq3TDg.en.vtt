00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:09.599
 see how important it is to go 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:15.019
 let's now put inc to create a header selected this cell in the 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:16.829
 we are going to put obstacles that make 

00:00:16.829 --> 00:00:20.369
 I'm going to remove the background color here and I'll tell you none 

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:23.400
 in fact this cell 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.400
 I'm going to put a lime insert image 

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:29.749
 in the folder we are working I am going to put 

00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:32.749
 be here, look, this affected 

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.800
 alternative image for now we accept or do not worry 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:41.820
 the cell occupies us completely has been adapted has become larger for 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.890
 that fits the whole image 

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.450
 very well let's put now is on the plot that we equip do the 

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:48.770
 little girl 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:49.980
 aasi

 selection to be here and lic I'm going to remove the background for now we remove the 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:00:59.940
 background 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.530
 we already have here we go is to be with your image 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:04.520
 insert image 

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:06.049
 look what we have here 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:07.650
 they're here 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.090
 this one 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.510
 does not have anything would be the peace part done this be the top part 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:16.590
 but I'm interested to know how much I want my daughter 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:17.710
 and a week 

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:21.010
 the smallest echo and locate perfectly the same 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:24.240
 as if it were another cell another tiny cell here 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.340
 for this very reason 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.160
 that will also have an image an image 

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:32.720
 let it be the continuation of these 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.690
 I insert an image 

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:37.690
 very well the confirmation of this in this 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.610
 4 4 this time they are the perfect lines 

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.140
 accept this I do not worry 

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.380
 Now I'm going to correct the size of the fees again 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.620
 and finally we are going to create the one here 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:53.620
 I take a cell tiago 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.109
 very well and we are going to insert an image 

00:01:58.109 --> 00:02:01.249
 I insert an image of these and that we had 

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.480
 poor's the appointment is at work 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.520
 very well I accepted this dialogue 

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.129
 perfect and elderly 

00:02:09.129 --> 00:02:10.989
 good now let's create 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:14.949
 another cell on the right rakitic part that will occupy 

00:02:14.949 --> 00:02:16.279
 all this supposes 

00:02:16.279 --> 00:02:17.539
 a well 

00:02:17.539 --> 00:02:20.859
 up here perfect and sink a bit later 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:24.950
 very well messi had inside we were going to insert an image 

00:02:25.869 --> 00:02:28.869
 we have it 

00:02:29.859 --> 00:02:33.079
 the testa patrias to date 

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:36.849
 perfect to make this dialogue do not worry me boyacá chicó moon bigger 

00:02:36.849 --> 00:02:39.239
 so that it could 

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:43.450
 now to finish we are going to make these cells of the medium are those that I am interested in 

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:49.239
 that adapt select femsa I put it here selected the other I put it here 

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:50.520
 to fill everything 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:51.809
 selected this 

00:02:51.809 --> 00:02:56.839
 I put it here and finally we'll make this the autopsy speak look 

00:02:56.839 --> 00:03:00.279
 that for now wever is making us the last infinite 

00:03:00.279 --> 00:03:01.909
 we did here do 

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:04.089
 author who speaks 

00:03:04.089 --> 00:03:10.779
 we already have 204 152 and pique quito this will be although expandable 

00:03:10.779 --> 00:03:12.749
 let's check it 

00:03:12.749 --> 00:03:15.090
 vick browser preview 

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:17.339
 we accept 

00:03:17.339 --> 00:03:19.819
 and here we have it 

00:03:19.819 --> 00:03:22.809
 for this it adapts and the cells side remain 

00:03:22.809 --> 00:03:24.749
 perfectly 

00:03:24.749 --> 00:03:27.359
 see what I was here has left us like sojeros 

00:03:27.359 --> 00:03:31.700
 let's see what inside an image of a cell I can put a picture of 

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:32.419
 background 

00:03:32.419 --> 00:03:35.379
 we go back to linguists 

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:36.960
 let's see now how to power 

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:39.949
 this image for example background of this cell 

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:44.389
 If you select the cell in the design module, look at it, it allows me to change the 

00:03:44.389 --> 00:03:45.709
 background color 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:47.919
 but when it allows us to change 

00:03:47.919 --> 00:03:49.819
 ed the background image 

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:53.799
 for this we have to work also then in the standard mode we are going to 

00:03:53.799 --> 00:03:55.159
 move standards 

00:03:55.159 --> 00:03:59.239
 perfect look here yes yes I have celta xerez and nothing allows me to put a 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:03:59.920
 image 

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:04.160
 In the background, you have to know how to work with the design mode and with the 

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:05.539
 standard mode 

00:04:05.539 --> 00:04:08.290
 the two I released extremely useful 

00:04:08.290 --> 00:04:09.089
 very well 

00:04:09.089 --> 00:04:12.859
 what are we going to do, select this cell and I'm interested in having this own 

00:04:12.859 --> 00:04:17.479
 background image and then how is background will act as mosaic is 

00:04:17.479 --> 00:04:18.489
 will repeat 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:21.840
 infinitely as big as this path is 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:24.960
 look at the trick the image was injured 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:27.960
 says that the origin of that style selection 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:31.210
 perfect we select central 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:33.930
 brenda tití sections of tevé labels 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:37.509
 and the parameters appear I come here thoroughly cnt 

00:04:37.509 --> 00:04:38.639
 i left them 

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:42.280
 very well squeezed did it look and grows perfectly 

00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.150
 let's see with the browser 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:47.539
 i already have it perfectly done look 

00:04:47.539 --> 00:04:49.979
 how is it growing 

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:54.129
 with this we have seen that I can put a background image according to finance 

00:04:54.879 --> 00:04:55.779
 selection 

00:04:55.779 --> 00:04:58.419
 be here daily the lookout- process 

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:00.689
 this here of course we can erase it 

00:05:00.689 --> 00:05:04.939
 and now like this fund we can write stephens clubs 

00:05:04.939 --> 00:05:09.080
 instead in this here we could not write because you already have an image 

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.439
 here I can put a headline 

00:05:11.439 --> 00:05:16.309
 sub-catalog tencent internet for example 

00:05:16.870 --> 00:05:18.789
 about if I can center it 

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:23.229
 because the background image is horizontally it could be central 

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:25.300
 and vertically I can 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:27.300
 with this means look 

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:28.710
 correct as it is 

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:33.330
 a background image is not inside the cell itself and I can draw on it 

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:34.290
 what you want 

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:35.240
 and even 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:38.430
 is for example here I can not anymore because I was focused because I have the 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:41.430
 own image then selections 

00:05:43.599 --> 00:05:45.219
 I'm going to date 

00:05:45.219 --> 00:05:48.339
 and I put the name 

00:05:48.339 --> 00:05:52.169
 I already repeated it in the background now I can take this race image 

00:05:52.809 --> 00:05:55.809
 I can write whatever you want in this area here 

00:05:59.689 --> 00:06:02.689
 your store 

00:06:04.809 --> 00:06:06.599
 this web 

00:06:06.599 --> 00:06:07.400
 the leader 

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:10.699
 I'm going to say it centered horizontally centered 

00:06:10.699 --> 00:06:12.419
 and practically inferior 

00:06:12.419 --> 00:06:15.900
 very good but I have work look how I can control 

00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:17.509
 Where are the things 

00:06:17.509 --> 00:06:19.650
 I go to the preview in the browser 

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:21.270
 when the changes 

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:22.569
 i look 

00:06:22.569 --> 00:06:25.869
 adapts perfectly to the center 

00:06:25.869 --> 00:06:27.979
 that we have left the top 

00:06:27.979 --> 00:06:29.719
 he got injured 

00:06:29.719 --> 00:06:30.909
 ringo ibeas 

00:06:30.909 --> 00:06:33.569
 I'm going to be here here that recently I have a color of 

00:06:33.569 --> 00:06:34.229
 background 

00:06:34.229 --> 00:06:37.479
 I took out cell selection and simply that instead of image 

00:06:37.479 --> 00:06:39.779
 I put background and the same as here 

00:06:39.779 --> 00:06:43.770
 it sounds perfectly and this image now I can remove it 

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:44.669
 very well 

00:06:44.669 --> 00:06:47.669
 perfect let's see how we are staying 

00:06:48.689 --> 00:06:51.439
 with this we want is seen as 

00:06:51.439 --> 00:06:55.160
 work mode are tarqui in design mode 

00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:56.050
 both 

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:57.930
 work with the two modes 

00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:00.879
 vueling uribe to work with the two bass drums 

00:07:00.879 --> 00:07:04.240
 to create tables is the best way to control 

00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:06.389
 It is not trapp application 

00:07:06.389 --> 00:07:10.319
 the design mode will help me to create variable shapes 

00:07:10.319 --> 00:07:14.259
 but then we'll go back to stand mode aspa modifying many 

00:07:14.259 --> 00:07:16.579
 parameters that design mode where persists
