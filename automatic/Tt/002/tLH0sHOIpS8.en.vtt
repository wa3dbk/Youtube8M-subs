and they were pounding it till it became

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.270 
and they were pounding it till it became
a<00:02:43.390> paste<00:02:43.780> now<00:02:43.989> that's<00:02:44.680> just<00:02:44.800> a<00:02:44.920> lot<00:02:45.040> of<00:02:45.130> work

00:02:45.270 --> 00:02:45.280 
a paste now that's just a lot of work

where it's going now another thing

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:53.820 
where it's going now another thing
though<00:02:51.880> I'll<00:02:52.180> add<00:02:52.450> in<00:02:52.720> it<00:02:52.870> while<00:02:53.140> I'm<00:02:53.290> doing<00:02:53.680> it

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:53.830 
though I'll add in it while I'm doing it

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:56.130 
though I'll add in it while I'm doing it
is<00:02:53.980> I<00:02:54.160> add<00:02:54.370> a<00:02:54.400> little<00:02:54.670> bit<00:02:54.880> of<00:02:54.910> salt<00:02:55.300> and<00:02:55.480> just<00:02:55.540> a

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:56.140 
is I add a little bit of salt and just a

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.530 
is I add a little bit of salt and just a
little<00:02:56.260> bit<00:02:56.470> of<00:02:56.620> olive<00:02:57.130> oil<00:02:57.519> that's<00:02:58.030> about<00:02:58.330> it

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:02.350 
so this is basically how it's done in

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:04.770 
so this is basically how it's done in
many<00:03:02.680> households<00:03:03.430> not<00:03:03.850> like<00:03:04.030> I<00:03:04.150> said<00:03:04.450> some
