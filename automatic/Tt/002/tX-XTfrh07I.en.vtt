not<00:00:55.400> so<00:00:55.579> sure<00:00:55.760> like<00:00:56.120> that

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:05.260 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.020 

been<00:01:05.710> trying<00:01:05.920> to<00:01:06.100> decide<00:01:06.400> what<00:01:06.610> to<00:01:06.700> do<00:01:06.880> with

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.030 
been trying to decide what to do with

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:09.780 
been trying to decide what to do with
the<00:01:07.150> Sun<00:01:07.450> I<00:01:08.080> like<00:01:08.620> the<00:01:08.800> plan<00:01:09.010> and<00:01:09.190> I<00:01:09.310> originally

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:09.790 
the Sun I like the plan and I originally

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:11.130 
the Sun I like the plan and I originally
had<00:01:09.880> it<00:01:10.000> planned<00:01:10.180> on<00:01:10.420> the<00:01:10.510> other<00:01:10.659> side<00:01:10.900> you

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:11.140 
had it planned on the other side you

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.240 
had it planned on the other side you
just<00:01:11.320> saw<00:01:11.970> but<00:01:12.970> I<00:01:13.360> might<00:01:14.170> decide<00:01:14.590> to<00:01:14.830> flip<00:01:15.040> it

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:15.250 
just saw but I might decide to flip it

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.230 
just saw but I might decide to flip it
this<00:01:15.550> year<00:01:15.880> and<00:01:16.290> plan<00:01:17.290> it<00:01:17.440> on<00:01:17.530> this<00:01:17.710> side

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
this year and plan it on this side

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.969 
this year and plan it on this side
thinking<00:01:19.240> about<00:01:19.570> maybe<00:01:19.840> a<00:01:19.990> forest<00:01:20.470> planning

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:20.979 
thinking about maybe a forest planning

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:25.950 
thinking about maybe a forest planning
that<00:01:21.850> would<00:01:22.619> fill<00:01:23.619> in<00:01:23.800> this<00:01:24.009> area

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:25.960 
that would fill in this area

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:30.000 
that would fill in this area
probably

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:30.010 

00:01:30.010 --> 00:01:32.730 

because<00:01:30.730> it's<00:01:30.970> the<00:01:31.210> concave<00:01:31.690> side<00:01:31.930> I<00:01:32.110> want<00:01:32.710> to

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:32.740 
because it's the concave side I want to

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.790 
because it's the concave side I want to
be<00:01:32.800> careful<00:01:33.160> to<00:01:33.370> keep<00:01:33.670> the<00:01:33.940> soil<00:01:34.240> level<00:01:34.720> as<00:01:35.080> low

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:35.800 
be careful to keep the soil level as low

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.430 
be careful to keep the soil level as low
as<00:01:36.040> possible<00:01:36.070> but<00:01:36.940> still<00:01:37.540> enough<00:01:37.960> to<00:01:38.110> keep<00:01:38.320> the

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:38.440 
as possible but still enough to keep the

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:43.350 
as possible but still enough to keep the
trees<00:01:38.860> good<00:01:39.070> and<00:01:39.280> healthy<00:01:41.700> now<00:01:42.700> that's<00:01:43.240> a

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:43.360 
trees good and healthy now that's a

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.620 
trees good and healthy now that's a
definite<00:01:43.780> possibility<00:01:45.120> stone<00:01:46.120> looks<00:01:46.360> really

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:46.630 
definite possibility stone looks really

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.670 
definite possibility stone looks really
good<00:01:46.810> from<00:01:46.960> this<00:01:47.200> side<00:01:47.640> now<00:01:48.640> it's<00:01:49.120> really<00:01:49.680> no

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:50.680 
good from this side now it's really no

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:55.590 
good from this side now it's really no
bad<00:01:51.330> breaks<00:01:52.330> or<00:01:52.630> ugly<00:01:53.020> areas<00:01:54.090> the<00:01:55.090> colors<00:01:55.570> a

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:55.600 
bad breaks or ugly areas the colors a

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:57.660 
bad breaks or ugly areas the colors a
little<00:01:55.960> different<00:01:56.380> but<00:01:56.650> yeah<00:01:56.980> most<00:01:57.340> of<00:01:57.640> it

00:01:57.660 --> 00:01:57.670 
little different but yeah most of it

00:01:57.670 --> 00:01:59.760 
little different but yeah most of it
will<00:01:57.910> be<00:01:57.940> covered<00:01:58.390> up<00:01:58.750> so<00:01:58.990> I<00:01:59.170> think<00:01:59.590> what

00:01:59.760 --> 00:01:59.770 
will be covered up so I think what

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.030 
will be covered up so I think what
you'll<00:02:00.010> end<00:02:00.040> up<00:02:00.520> seeing<00:02:00.790> is<00:02:01.090> the<00:02:01.270> dark<00:02:01.540> area

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
you'll end up seeing is the dark area

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.920 
you'll end up seeing is the dark area
across<00:02:03.040> here<00:02:03.460> primarily<00:02:03.730> this<00:02:04.360> area<00:02:04.750> in<00:02:04.840> the

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:04.930 
across here primarily this area in the

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:08.670 
across here primarily this area in the
back<00:02:05.110> I<00:02:05.140> think<00:02:05.410> will<00:02:05.650> be<00:02:05.770> covered<00:02:06.220> so<00:02:06.630> that<00:02:07.680> it

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:08.680 
back I think will be covered so that it

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:10.950 
back I think will be covered so that it
might<00:02:08.860> be<00:02:09.010> interesting<00:02:09.160> a<00:02:09.760> little<00:02:10.570> different

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:10.960 
might be interesting a little different

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:13.910 
might be interesting a little different
I<00:02:11.140> wonder<00:02:12.010> what<00:02:12.190> direction<00:02:12.610> that<00:02:12.940> Stein<00:02:13.270> is<00:02:13.570> I

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
I wonder what direction that Stein is I

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.250 
I wonder what direction that Stein is I
guess<00:02:14.920> if<00:02:15.100> I<00:02:15.220> step<00:02:15.520> back<00:02:15.760> on<00:02:16.090> you<00:02:16.300> stretch<00:02:16.690> this

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:17.260 
guess if I step back on you stretch this

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.530 
guess if I step back on you stretch this
way
