passion we're seeing in Egypt is
absolutely<00:00:24.270> real<00:00:24.510> I<00:00:24.840> think<00:00:25.110> that<00:00:25.500> 50%<00:00:26.160> of<00:00:26.220> the

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:33.089 
their breaking point and I believe that

00:00:33.089 --> 00:00:35.360 
their breaking point and I believe that
it's<00:00:33.420> real<00:00:33.660> these<00:00:34.379> people<00:00:34.769> truly<00:00:35.160> do<00:00:35.339> want

however what I really want to get to is

00:00:50.159 --> 00:00:52.790 
however what I really want to get to is
the<00:00:50.190> fact<00:00:50.519> that<00:00:50.960> regardless<00:00:51.960> of<00:00:52.199> what<00:00:52.350> happens

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.619 
in Egypt regardless of how this shakes
out<00:00:55.379> it's<00:00:55.890> important<00:00:56.429> to<00:00:56.519> know<00:00:56.729> that<00:00:56.999> the

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
out it's important to know that the

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.479 
out it's important to know that the

is 100 percent by design and sadly I

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.389 
is 100 percent by design and sadly I
think<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.600> argument<00:01:04.049> can<00:01:04.199> be<00:01:04.229> made<00:01:04.339> that<00:01:05.339> it

00:01:05.389 --> 00:01:05.399 
think the argument can be made that it

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:07.039 
think the argument can be made that it
is<00:01:05.579> all<00:01:05.909> our<00:01:06.270> fault
