00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
it's one thing that that's already a

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:45.979 
it's one thing that that's already a
really<00:00:43.739> hard<00:00:44.280> matchup<00:00:44.550> for<00:00:44.879> belkin<00:00:45.120> and<00:00:45.570> so<00:00:45.809> is

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:45.989 
really hard matchup for belkin and so is

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:49.069 
really hard matchup for belkin and so is
fox<00:00:46.260> but<00:00:47.039> chic<00:00:47.670> works<00:00:47.969> very<00:00:48.270> well<00:00:48.390> in<00:00:48.570> close

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
quarters which is all you going to get

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.090 
quarters which is all you going to get
in<00:00:50.640> teams<00:00:50.910> and<00:00:51.239> falcon<00:00:51.899> needs<00:00:52.170> a<00:00:52.410> lot<00:00:52.739> of<00:00:52.770> room

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
in teams and falcon needs a lot of room

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:54.920 
in teams and falcon needs a lot of room
so<00:00:53.370> that<00:00:53.399> means<00:00:53.760> if<00:00:53.969> he's<00:00:54.180> not<00:00:54.420> looking<00:00:54.780> at
