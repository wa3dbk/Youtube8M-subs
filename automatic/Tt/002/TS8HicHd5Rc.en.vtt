old<00:01:26.640> and<00:01:26.970> it<00:01:27.210> would<00:01:27.479> make<00:01:27.780> your<00:01:28.020> paper<00:01:28.320> not

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
old and it would make your paper not

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:32.390 
old and it would make your paper not
even<00:01:29.400> so<00:01:30.150> you<00:01:30.210> would<00:01:30.479> get<00:01:30.780> that<00:01:30.990> impression<00:01:31.400> so

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
even so you would get that impression so

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.219 
even so you would get that impression so
i<00:01:32.430> would<00:01:32.640> say<00:01:32.880> the<00:01:33.060> best<00:01:33.240> thing<00:01:33.540> if<00:01:33.810> you<00:01:33.960> get<00:01:34.200> a

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
i would say the best thing if you get a

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:37.310 
i would say the best thing if you get a
phone<00:01:34.619> that<00:01:35.220> would<00:01:35.490> be<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:35.820> ideal<00:01:36.090> thing<00:01:36.420> so

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
phone that would be the ideal thing so

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.390 
phone that would be the ideal thing so
i'm<00:01:37.500> saving<00:01:38.009> one<00:01:38.220> me<00:01:38.520> just<00:01:38.909> for<00:01:39.150> my<00:01:39.210> stamping

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:40.400 
i'm saving one me just for my stamping

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.679 
i'm saving one me just for my stamping
so<00:01:41.400> i'm<00:01:41.490> putting<00:01:41.670> a<00:01:41.880> piece<00:01:42.090> of<00:01:42.119> paper<00:01:42.450> here

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
so i'm putting a piece of paper here

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.170 
so i'm putting a piece of paper here
because<00:01:43.200> we're<00:01:43.439> going<00:01:43.619> to<00:01:43.710> stamp<00:01:44.040> off<00:01:44.310> so<00:01:44.909> it's

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
because we're going to stamp off so it's

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.940 
because we're going to stamp off so it's
going<00:01:45.420> to<00:01:45.509> be<00:01:45.600> easier<00:01:46.670> so<00:01:47.670> if<00:01:48.450> we<00:01:49.409> use<00:01:49.439> the

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
going to be easier so if we use the

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.789 
going to be easier so if we use the
stamp-a-ma-jig<00:01:50.430> we<00:01:51.119> have<00:01:51.299> to<00:01:51.570> remember<00:01:51.899> which

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
stamp-a-ma-jig we have to remember which

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.520 
stamp-a-ma-jig we have to remember which
we<00:01:53.159> go<00:01:53.399> where<00:01:53.729> because<00:01:54.329> if<00:01:54.479> not<00:01:54.659> we<00:01:54.720> won't<00:01:55.229> know

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
we go where because if not we won't know

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.399 
we go where because if not we won't know
so<00:01:55.890> i<00:01:56.100> know<00:01:56.250> it<00:01:56.759> is<00:01:56.880> my<00:01:57.149> stamping<00:01:57.840> it's<00:01:58.079> in<00:01:58.290> the

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
so i know it is my stamping it's in the

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.870 
so i know it is my stamping it's in the
bottom<00:01:58.860> so<00:01:59.549> that's<00:01:59.759> what<00:02:00.030> i'm<00:02:00.149> going<00:02:00.299> to<00:02:00.390> do<00:02:00.630> I

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
bottom so that's what i'm going to do I

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:07.210 
bottom so that's what i'm going to do I
going<00:02:02.880> to<00:02:02.969> end<00:02:03.240> that<00:02:03.509> with<00:02:04.020> my<00:02:04.320> white<00:02:04.799> crap<00:02:05.280> in

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:51.540 
for that we have to let dried the

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:54.949 
for that we have to let dried the
cracking<00:02:52.080> you<00:02:52.320> can<00:02:52.530> use<00:02:52.800> your<00:02:53.209> heat<00:02:54.209> tool<00:02:54.270> for

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
cracking you can use your heat tool for

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:59.150 
cracking you can use your heat tool for
that<00:02:54.989> the<00:02:55.410> embossing<00:02:56.360> eat<00:02:57.360> tool<00:02:57.720> or<00:02:57.989> just<00:02:58.980> put

that the embossing eat tool or just put
it<00:02:59.280> aside<00:02:59.459> and<00:02:59.880> let<00:03:00.150> it<00:03:00.180> dry<00:03:00.600> at<00:03:00.810> least<00:03:00.840> like<00:03:01.590> a

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:01.620 
it aside and let it dry at least like a

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.640 
it aside and let it dry at least like a
five<00:03:02.100> minutes<00:03:02.730> if<00:03:03.150> not<00:03:03.209> when<00:03:03.900> you<00:03:04.050> stamp<00:03:04.350> with

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
five minutes if not when you stamp with

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.330 
five minutes if not when you stamp with
your<00:03:04.860> color<00:03:05.160> ink<00:03:05.580> it's<00:03:06.390> going<00:03:06.720> to<00:03:07.010> really<00:03:08.010> get

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:08.340 
your color ink it's going to really get

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:12.710 
your color ink it's going to really get
the<00:03:08.580> white<00:03:08.820> on<00:03:09.150> your<00:03:10.790> stamp<00:03:11.790> and<00:03:12.090> all<00:03:12.209> that<00:03:12.450> so

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
the white on your stamp and all that so

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.020 
the white on your stamp and all that so
it's<00:03:12.870> better<00:03:13.140> if<00:03:13.350> you<00:03:13.530> let<00:03:13.739> it<00:03:13.770> dry<00:03:13.920> so<00:03:14.850> now

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:15.030 
it's better if you let it dry so now

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:18.020 
it's better if you let it dry so now
we're<00:03:15.239> going<00:03:15.390> to<00:03:15.480> watch<00:03:15.570> this<00:03:16.290> oh<00:03:16.739> I'm<00:03:17.610> almost

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
we're going to watch this oh I'm almost

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.039 
we're going to watch this oh I'm almost
out<00:03:18.269> of<00:03:18.330> the<00:03:18.750> spritz<00:03:19.200> here<00:03:19.440> here<00:03:20.370> we<00:03:20.489> go<00:03:20.870> so<00:03:21.870> now

00:03:22.039 --> 00:03:22.049 
out of the spritz here here we go so now

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:25.699 
out of the spritz here here we go so now
I<00:03:22.110> have<00:03:22.260> to<00:03:22.620> wash<00:03:22.830> it<00:03:22.860> and<00:03:23.430> try<00:03:24.000> to<00:03:24.440> keep<00:03:25.440> the

00:03:25.699 --> 00:03:25.709 
I have to wash it and try to keep the

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:28.130 
I have to wash it and try to keep the
stamp<00:03:26.100> at<00:03:26.310> the<00:03:26.370> right<00:03:26.850> place<00:03:27.269> so<00:03:27.299> then<00:03:27.720> we<00:03:27.930> can

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
stamp at the right place so then we can

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.890 
stamp at the right place so then we can
match<00:03:28.350> it<00:03:28.380> perfectly<00:03:29.150> like<00:03:30.150> mine<00:03:30.450> was<00:03:30.480> not

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:30.900 
match it perfectly like mine was not

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:32.690 
match it perfectly like mine was not
matched<00:03:31.170> perfectly<00:03:31.530> but<00:03:32.100> I'm<00:03:32.250> going<00:03:32.430> to<00:03:32.519> show

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
matched perfectly but I'm going to show

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.380 
matched perfectly but I'm going to show
you<00:03:32.760> how<00:03:32.850> to<00:03:33.030> match<00:03:33.600> it<00:03:33.930> and<00:03:34.049> you<00:03:34.140> see<00:03:35.010> those

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:35.390 
you how to match it and you see those

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:38.330 
you how to match it and you see those
photopolymer<00:03:36.390> they<00:03:36.660> stick<00:03:37.110> on<00:03:37.290> the<00:03:37.680> blog<00:03:37.980> like

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
photopolymer they stick on the blog like

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.270 
photopolymer they stick on the blog like
no<00:03:38.610> tomorrow<00:03:38.670> so<00:03:39.630> that's<00:03:40.140> one<00:03:40.500> good<00:03:40.769> thing<00:03:40.799> and

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:41.280 
no tomorrow so that's one good thing and

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.390 
no tomorrow so that's one good thing and
it<00:03:41.459> is<00:03:41.610> the<00:03:41.880> through<00:03:42.269> clear<00:03:42.720> stamp<00:03:43.200> so<00:03:44.130> with

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.400 
it is the through clear stamp so with

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:52.260 
it is the through clear stamp so with
all<00:03:44.610> the<00:03:44.970> tips<00:03:45.299> i<00:03:46.190> think<00:03:47.190> it<00:03:47.340> is<00:03:47.370> perfect

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:52.270 

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:57.250 

and<00:03:53.830> the<00:03:54.830> white<00:03:55.070> ink<00:03:55.430> released<00:03:56.060> is<00:03:56.570> stick<00:03:57.050> to

00:03:57.250 --> 00:03:57.260 
and the white ink released is stick to

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:12.180 
and the white ink released is stick to
this<00:03:57.440> so<00:03:57.740> you<00:03:57.800> have<00:03:58.010> to<00:03:58.220> really<00:03:58.250> wash<00:03:59.180> it<00:03:59.570> good

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:12.190 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:15.699 

here<00:04:13.190> we<00:04:13.340> go<00:04:13.459> I<00:04:13.670> think<00:04:13.970> it's<00:04:14.120> clean<00:04:14.510> enough<00:04:14.709> so

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:15.709 
here we go I think it's clean enough so

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:19.990 
here we go I think it's clean enough so
now<00:04:15.860> I<00:04:15.920> had<00:04:16.250> pre<00:04:16.640> done<00:04:16.880> one<00:04:18.310> so<00:04:19.310> you<00:04:19.400> can<00:04:19.730> see

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:20.000 
now I had pre done one so you can see

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.030 
now I had pre done one so you can see
it's<00:04:20.180> already<00:04:20.450> done<00:04:20.959> so<00:04:21.410> now<00:04:21.590> what<00:04:21.859> we're

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:22.040

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:40.910 
corner of this and then it's the corner

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:43.150 
corner of this and then it's the corner
of<00:04:40.940> the<00:04:41.330> stamp<00:04:41.630> so<00:04:42.260> now<00:04:42.380> I<00:04:42.440> have<00:04:42.590> to<00:04:42.890> remember

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:43.160
