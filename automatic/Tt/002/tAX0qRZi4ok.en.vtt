00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.319
 very good friends and friends of youtube 

00:00:02.399 --> 00:00:06.299
 Today I will teach you how to solve the 

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.519
 error that many people are sure that 

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:10.650
 is the envy stopped working and it 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:14.070
 I recovered this error I started to appear 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:16.199
 when installing the windows 10 good this 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:18.390
 error can be caused by two reasons 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:21.210
 the first one is about an update 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:23.880
 and the second one is for time so that's why 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.910
 I explain later time good without 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.960
 more nothing to say start let's go for 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:29.960
 the number one mistake 

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:36.090
 go to control panel and uninstall 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:36.090
 Program 

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:41.360
 once there uninstall the driver 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.010
 nvidia video and they go to the page 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.050
 that I will leave you in the description of 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:48.500
 video and the driver are downloaded 

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:50.810
 updated once installed is already and 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.879
 If the error still appears then 

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:55.450
 stay to see how I solve the error 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:55.450
 number 2 

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:00.899
 now let's go for error number 2 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:05.390
 we go down and look for regedit 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.840
 once here we go to that local 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.040
 machine 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:24.490
 then a system 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:25.800
 then to current control set then to 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:29.930
 control 

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.930
 and finally to graphics drivers 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:34.410
 now before we continue we minimize the 

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.420
 page and we go to properties the 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:40.820
 team and we see how many bit is our 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.820
 pc in my case is 32 bits 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:47.590
 we go back to the page and we click 

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:50.550
 new right and value 32 bit or 64 bit a 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:50.550
 what is your case 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:57.780
 now we put tdr delight 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:04.870
 and we put it in value 8 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.979

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.980
