00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:37.329
 follow up which would talk about it 

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:37.329
 that would take years 

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.690
 Why is there really a project ? 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:43.190
 the people just a lot of what i do 

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:45.410
 very bad, but there are also 

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:46.790
 the people on the channel 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:48.859
 they just do not help but 

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:52.340
 just good at finding the project and having fun 

00:03:48.859 --> 00:03:54.470
 because we do that for us 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:56.450

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:07.520

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:09.380
