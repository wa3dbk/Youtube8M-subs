00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:11.269
 in this video we are going to change the filter 

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:15.049
 of gasoline that is this that is here 

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:18.500
 has this connection and this one that brings 

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:21.430
 1 leg and two legs uc to lift 

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:26.020
 this little foot and they pushed to infiltrate already 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:29.780
 so I can so you can leave 

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:33.610
 try to make noise a clear place 

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:33.610
 with a lot of air 

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:40.030
 have a chat for the reason very 

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:42.970
 important official talk of the hour of 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.890
 remove the used one to put in the way 

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:47.540
 correct and the new 

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:50.690
 then you have to throw 

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:55.070
 those two legs 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:55.070
 what is this here 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:02.740
 pushing it forward and lifting 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.740
 the legs 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.260
 I would check out the gas filter 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:17.520
 here in total connection would be the other 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:20.729
 we have the filter 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:23.310
 I used more than anything to make sure 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:27.259
 have a container to throw the 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.259
 gasoline pulling 

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:33.159
 and be in a very ventilated place 

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.000
 have you on a flannel to clean the 

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:38.260
 excess of 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.260
 of spilled gasoline 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:46.230
 since we have everything clean 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.230
 we proceed to install the magician filter 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:52.510
 without forgetting the position of the filter 

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:56.100
 only 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.990
 we place 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:16.490
 we look for a new filter by clicking 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:18.800
 until we press 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:20.980
 would be a connection and the other for the 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:25.560
 back side 

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:29.390
 and this has to make sure that he clicks 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.390
 done this we clean 

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:38.120
 and verify that it is well explored 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:41.360
 before turning on the car you have to 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:43.370
 open the switch three times this for 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:46.360
 the pressure is back 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.360
 gasoline system 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.600
 we close 

00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:59.690
 we open 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.069
 and finally 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:15.430
 in fact this has to go to review the 

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:19.010
 filter that does not leak and here we can 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:21.879
 see that it is indeed 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:21.879
 It's so dry 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.130
 and in the back 

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:30.110
 It is also dry 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:32.799
 and has verified we can turn on the car 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:32.799
 No problem 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.569
 and ready 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:44.850
 ok then that would be all for changing your 

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:47.580
 petrol filter as you see it is very easy 

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:48.690
 I hope to be served and soon to come up 

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:51.140
 the new video 

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.140
 regards
