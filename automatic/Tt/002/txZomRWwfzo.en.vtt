00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.910
 I'm from Oldenburg so and then 

00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:10.759
 when I grew up in the 70s 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:14.480
 vfb oldenburg did not offer that 

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:16.680
 overwhelming potential for identification 

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.630
 that may be a bit today 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.520
 different but that's early childhood 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.199
 I've embossing then at that time 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:22.590
 The thumbs are determined 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.449
 to press 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.529
 no matter what happens to me 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.090
 we can also in the circle class 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.099
 I would still go down the 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.859
 I do not doubt thumb 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.390
 that's what the trend in exactly that 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.610
 the other direction goes up 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.380
 do not go down that lifelong 

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:39.600
 means to me that I now 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.570
 lifelong as an ambassador 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.129
 will be 

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.390
 werder changes sometime but there 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.649
 who is there known for the long 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:51.000
 periods in which there is thinking and of 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.000
 Therefore, I assume that the 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.010
 Now some decades will be like this 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.390
 Werder fan is looking at you now 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.760
 There's a lot going on over there 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.320
 important thing which is alright 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.480
 That's why I can be the biggest 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.580
 give from me because the music plays on 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.490
 the place the truth lies on the 

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.920
 place like a famous bremer philosopher 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.650
 once said in handling the ball 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.450
 I have technical deficits like me 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.850
 not going to be real anymore 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.650
 That's why I have to balance now 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.030
 not even with new good ones 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.400
 team necessarily train that 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.740
 I do with the sons and theirs 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.030
 friends in the village now and then and even there 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.070
 I have to watch that 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.930
 nobody hurt 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.520
 So not hurt but at 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.259
 I'm always more in danger of that 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.060
 I then just frustrated directly in the 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:37.680
 bones jump in and that's what I want 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.790
 now the werder fans to watch 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.840
 I do not expect that here with me 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:45.270
 train a hard- bitten grazer so what 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.970
 there is hardly anything better 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.750
 in life as if you are so new now 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.399
 area of â€‹â€‹interest discovered for themselves and 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.079
 Suddenly the curiosity begins 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.509
 overflows and is similar to the one 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:55.950
 Movements actually, so I have 

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:58.259
 now that this harvest this year 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.149
 the first time that so full for swimming 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.439
 I discover an activity that I 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.960
 actually do not like 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:05.969
 and then I thought to myself now 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:07.490
 especially if you do not like that that's it 

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:10.190
 much more interesting yet 

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.720
 that's exciting to find out how 

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:13.250
 You feel then if you have time 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.200
 longer distances swimming or that 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:18.830
 just noted down times and looks like 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.180
 you develop as a swimmer and so on 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.250
 that's still not really fun 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.569
 but I can still do incredibly good 

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.099
 anecdotes already tell about 

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:27.769
 strange waters where i am 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:29.989
 have been traveling and where we are before 

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:31.010
 all in harmless the weser weser 

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:32.750
 is probably not like that 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.180
 not dangerous because of the ships on it 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.860
 I'll drive in the next bremer 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.780
 let's see what 's up then as well 

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:41.239
 Well-known bathing lakes we would have been like that 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:44.239
 very exciting and now you have these 

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:45.890
 island nias harriersand or so he 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:47.900
 Nice destination so back and forth times 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:50.900
 so look because there is already flow 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.910
 neat yes, maybe even look 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.280
 Doing so dangerous does not deny that 

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:57.920
 I here as a promotional ambassador few tips 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:00.680
 give it up and now everybody is doing great 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.870
 rheine the life so swim there now 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.569
 all about you do not worry that is 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:06.530
 very easy 

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:14.329
 I might even be able to do that 

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:16.280
 make punishable if I then again 

00:03:14.329 --> 00:03:17.780
 cut out of all industries no 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:20.859
 that was the guy who did it completely 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.859
 misunderstood he is
