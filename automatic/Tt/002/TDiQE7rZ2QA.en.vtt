00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:46.250
 some feyenoord you walk a bit better because 

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.570
 if you don't have amplify boys yet 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.070
 of course walk but not so good 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:50.120
 with amplifier 

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:51.830
 so now I have to pay attention 

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:53.449
 because here they can Kempen is still running 

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:55.309
 a 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:57.589
 also the no yes-r 2010 is one 

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:59.720
 very strong weapon but not so strings 

00:00:57.589 --> 00:01:01.250
 other weapons so you need a little bit 

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.799
 know how to use as it were 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.760
 and the will wait here for a moment 

00:01:02.799 --> 00:01:07.070
 because I hear him coming the two are standing 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.729
 show second to god I'm sitting scooter 

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:09.530
 there will be another 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:11.750
 is still in the back there is the clit 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.740
 I think somewhere or he just lies 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.030
 the ground 

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.369
 why not unheard of on the ground 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:19.340
 remain lying yes always do that well 

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:20.299
 ah shit well started nice eight zero 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.560
 we were already back so that is natural 

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:22.789
 good start 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.189
 he has such a way is dead of course 

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:26.689
 always a bit a bit unfortunate 

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:29.810
 you name something but then of course makes it 

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:32.049
 not or from 18 a team is running, I know 

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.250
 hear him here 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:36.939
 oh shit going to go Hercules 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:36.939
 headless note 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.530
 and it will lie on the floor again 

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.240
 with that net oh and just smile with it 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.170
 the box on the ground and now none that there 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.520
 in the middle of the man just on the floor 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.689
 lie the step and must be in it 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.799
 kept an eye on 

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:47.210
 because if you get there right away there is more in the 

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:50.509
 folder lights up and you don't bother 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:52.310
 walk because of each other sometimes you go like that 

00:01:50.509 --> 00:01:53.810
 quick tote it sometimes seems like someone like them 

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.340
 kill with bee feels and axel or triforce 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:57.259
 you just get chilled by a sniper 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.310
 rifles something like that from you really that fast 

00:01:57.259 --> 00:01:59.899
 kill that it is no longer normal you see 

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.090
 weather for example that just isn't 

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:03.200
 fine and especially i am on a iota 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.819
 you can start again 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.590
 Of course it's not very nice 

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:08.239
 because she 's dying way but it is 

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:11.209
 well that way that i can do it 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:13.430
 chose so then you should also regular 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:14.720
 to respond in this way and not gallop 

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.610
 and drove you or so pussy the next two 

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.500
 I can need almost three years 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.420
 oh my god still a fast loader 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.160

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.500

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.480
 yes nice teammate to be careful 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:30.590
 my teammate nature survived equally them 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:32.480
 help to animals because I get there very much 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.950

 of course us that is nice 

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:43.040
 we can see a little more look at option 

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.700

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.930

 okay if I die that way 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.750
 I really don't care 

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:01.280
 I was waiting for that guy anyway 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.870
 and someone fell off making the film 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.250
 I just think that's good that makes me 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:05.780

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:08.630

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:10.040
 clock and I call that beautiful beautiful ted's 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:11.720
 but we have to make sure that we get the 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.010
 30 kills all hail for the 30 kills 

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:14.000
 camping in my back i see him through the 

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:15.950
 wall 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.109
 this is also the team itself and so mesko 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:19.609
 the dust nice then we must now again the 

00:03:18.109 --> 00:03:21.530
 our Maya team goes the other way and goes too 

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:23.450
 which also goes along a bit anyway 

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:26.090
 it wo n't survive in your cunt there 

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:27.920
 dog or rot you then he walks in there 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:29.690
 yes i saw that dog say turn around and 

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:31.010
 walk that way so that means 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:32.269
 there of course then their enemy only to 

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:33.170
 That 's why I'm standing here now 

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:35.510
 wait a moment 

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:37.489
 I am also in Amy's says come drop 

00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:40.260
 I heard young cake that I heard 

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:42.629
 now I'm sitting 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:45.390
 oh shit that girl come help what the 

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:47.189
 teammate behind me how this is also one 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:49.680
 beautiful that look this semtex look this 

00:03:47.189 --> 00:03:51.629
 really wonderful assistance of a pan 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.280
 you ca n't do anything about it and those people 

00:03:51.629 --> 00:03:54.030
 they just have skills look around 

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.709
 to wait for 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:56.940
 and this makes sense that he now relies on it 

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:58.379
 to run but that he has such a semtex 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:03:59.700
 ever imagine that you just put me on a wat 

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:01.590
 easier way to lift and this 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.700
 was such a bullshit again I throw someone 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:04.290
 they lead bullets in 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:06.120
 and so every time we go the whole day 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:08.099
 again and again in call or 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.720
 duty ghost and that makes the game on one 

00:04:08.099 --> 00:04:10.859
 side is nice on the other side 

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.209
 side can also be used again if you do a lot 

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:14.220
 of that kind of bullshit there are 

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:14.640
 for example but you just have to 

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:16.440
 pay attention 

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.329
 I was lucky inside I still remembered 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:19.829
 not that there was a hole man 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:21.389
 I often play this man dozer 

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:23.820

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:25.949
