the<00:01:03.629> reason<00:01:03.840> why<00:01:04.199> we<00:01:04.439> chose<00:01:05.510> runescape<00:01:06.510> back

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
the reason why we chose runescape back

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.359 
the reason why we chose runescape back
in<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:06.900> days<00:01:07.110> it's<00:01:07.320> probably<00:01:07.740> not<00:01:08.010> because<00:01:08.220> of

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
in the days it's probably not because of

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.820 
in the days it's probably not because of
the<00:01:08.520> graphic<00:01:08.790> because<00:01:09.270> let's<00:01:10.140> face<00:01:10.260> it<00:01:10.619> back

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
the graphic because let's face it back

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:12.890 
the graphic because let's face it back
in<00:01:10.979> the<00:01:11.070> days<00:01:11.280> runescape<00:01:12.240> graphics<00:01:12.420> were

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
in the days runescape graphics were

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.770 
in the days runescape graphics were
simply<00:01:13.530> a<00:01:13.650> rebel<00:01:14.130> even<00:01:14.310> compared<00:01:15.150> to<00:01:15.420> the<00:01:15.540> game

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:15.780 
simply a rebel even compared to the game

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.590 
simply a rebel even compared to the game
to<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:16.860> other<00:01:17.070> games<00:01:17.400> back<00:01:18.150> in<00:01:18.180> the<00:01:18.390> days<00:01:19.340> so

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600 
to the other games back in the days so

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.600 
to the other games back in the days so
most<00:01:21.600> I'm<00:01:21.960> sure<00:01:22.409> that<00:01:22.560> most<00:01:22.710> people<00:01:23.100> doesn't

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
most I'm sure that most people doesn't

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.399 
most I'm sure that most people doesn't
really<00:01:23.820> care<00:01:24.150> well<00:01:24.330> of<00:01:24.479> course<00:01:24.810> if<00:01:25.080> we<00:01:25.200> can't

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409 
really care well of course if we can't

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:27.320 
really care well of course if we can't
have<00:01:25.530> better<00:01:25.799> graphic<00:01:26.250> then<00:01:26.400> it's<00:01:26.580> good<00:01:26.909> the

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
silliman store yeah maybe not but yeah I

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.200 
silliman store yeah maybe not but yeah I
guess<00:02:01.140> you<00:02:01.259> get<00:02:01.439> my<00:02:01.590> point<00:02:01.890> what<00:02:02.549> if<00:02:02.700> most<00:02:03.090> of

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:03.210 
guess you get my point what if most of

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:05.090 
guess you get my point what if most of
the<00:02:03.360> team<00:02:03.600> is<00:02:03.780> working<00:02:03.990> on<00:02:04.320> the<00:02:04.439> graphic<00:02:04.829> part

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
the team is working on the graphic part

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.249 
the team is working on the graphic part
and<00:02:05.369> this<00:02:05.969> means<00:02:06.210> that<00:02:06.299> less<00:02:06.689> people<00:02:07.110> are

00:02:07.249 --> 00:02:07.259 
and this means that less people are

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.219 
and this means that less people are
working<00:02:07.469> on<00:02:07.799> real<00:02:08.280> Compton<00:02:08.759> so<00:02:09.360> improving<00:02:09.929> the

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
working on real Compton so improving the

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.520 
working on real Compton so improving the
game<00:02:10.500> with<00:02:11.099> new<00:02:11.310> mechanics<00:02:11.940> which<00:02:12.599> saw

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
game with new mechanics which saw

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.180 
game with new mechanics which saw
solving<00:02:14.130> worth<00:02:14.850> fixing<00:02:15.209> bugs<00:02:15.660> and<00:02:16.200> things

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:17.190 
solving worth fixing bugs and things

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.730 
solving worth fixing bugs and things
like<00:02:17.459> that<00:02:17.520> and<00:02:18.230> personally<00:02:19.230> that's<00:02:19.410> why<00:02:19.560> I'm

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:19.740 
like that and personally that's why I'm

00:02:19.740 --> 00:02:23.480 
like that and personally that's why I'm
looking<00:02:20.430> for<00:02:20.700> in<00:02:21.090> a<00:02:21.180> game<00:02:21.620> game<00:02:22.620> with<00:02:22.800> no<00:02:23.160> box

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
looking for in a game game with no box

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:26.690 
looking for in a game game with no box
again<00:02:24.090> with<00:02:24.390> new<00:02:25.230> things<00:02:25.260> to<00:02:25.950> do<00:02:26.100> well<00:02:26.520> maybe

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
again with new things to do well maybe

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.340 
again with new things to do well maybe
not<00:02:26.910> new<00:02:27.209> things<00:02:27.600> that<00:02:27.870> makes<00:02:28.080> the<00:02:28.230> game

00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:28.350 
not new things that makes the game

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:33.290 
not new things that makes the game
easier<00:02:28.500> but<00:02:29.069> you<00:02:30.470> like<00:02:31.470> you<00:02:31.830> can<00:02:32.670> release<00:02:33.060> new

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
easier but you like you can release new

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.720 
easier but you like you can release new
things<00:02:33.600> but<00:02:34.140> you<00:02:34.380> need<00:02:34.620> to<00:02:34.890> think<00:02:35.190> about<00:02:35.400> it

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730 
things but you need to think about it

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.410 
things but you need to think about it
and<00:02:35.880> think<00:02:36.270> about<00:02:36.480> the<00:02:36.950> consequences<00:02:37.950> of<00:02:38.730> the

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:39.420 
and think about the consequences of the

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.809 
and think about the consequences of the
updates<00:02:39.930> and<00:02:40.200> it's<00:02:40.650> not<00:02:40.860> really<00:02:41.069> that<00:02:41.220> hard<00:02:41.580> to

00:02:41.809 --> 00:02:41.819 
updates and it's not really that hard to

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:44.240 
updates and it's not really that hard to
make<00:02:42.000> well<00:02:42.600> it's<00:02:42.840> hard<00:02:43.200> to<00:02:43.290> make<00:02:43.500> new<00:02:43.650> content

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
make well it's hard to make new content

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.330 
make well it's hard to make new content
that<00:02:44.819> won't<00:02:45.150> screw<00:02:45.630> all<00:02:45.900> we<00:02:46.739> have<00:02:46.860> done<00:02:47.040> in<00:02:47.220> the

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:47.340 
that won't screw all we have done in the

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.330 
that won't screw all we have done in the
past<00:02:47.610> but<00:02:48.510> I<00:02:48.570> mean<00:02:48.900> there's<00:02:49.470> a<00:02:49.590> way<00:02:49.800> to<00:02:49.830> do<00:02:50.190> it

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
past but I mean there's a way to do it

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.110 
past but I mean there's a way to do it
and<00:02:50.550> there's<00:02:50.820> a<00:02:50.940> way<00:02:51.360> to<00:02:52.019> avoid<00:02:52.140> doing<00:02:52.980> it<00:02:53.220> and

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:54.120 
and there's a way to avoid doing it and

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:56.990 
and there's a way to avoid doing it and
I<00:02:54.300> think<00:02:54.360> jagex<00:02:55.080> should<00:02:55.470> put<00:02:56.100> more<00:02:56.400> time<00:02:56.760> and

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:57.000 
I think jagex should put more time and

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.449 
I think jagex should put more time and
effort<00:02:57.180> on<00:02:57.570> thinking<00:02:58.560> about<00:02:59.010> what<00:02:59.250> they<00:02:59.370> are

00:02:59.449 --> 00:02:59.459 
effort on thinking about what they are

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:02.210 
effort on thinking about what they are
doing<00:02:59.730> instead<00:03:00.300> of<00:03:00.450> working<00:03:01.140> on<00:03:01.560> the<00:03:01.800> graphic

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220 
doing instead of working on the graphic

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.690 
doing instead of working on the graphic
support<00:03:02.550> but<00:03:03.510> yeah<00:03:03.630> in<00:03:03.840> the<00:03:03.989> other<00:03:04.170> hand<00:03:04.700> even

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700 
support but yeah in the other hand even

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:08.680 
support but yeah in the other hand even
though<00:03:05.910> it<00:03:06.060> won't<00:03:06.300> really<00:03:06.540> pleased<00:03:07.080> well

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 
though it won't really pleased well

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:12.670 
though it won't really pleased well
general<00:03:09.830> point<00:03:10.830> of<00:03:10.890> view<00:03:11.100> but<00:03:11.220> I<00:03:11.280> mean<00:03:11.519> I<00:03:11.730> think

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 
general point of view but I mean I think

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:15.920 
general point of view but I mean I think
runescape<00:03:13.680> 3<00:03:13.860> updates<00:03:14.640> is<00:03:14.910> more<00:03:15.269> aimed<00:03:15.540> for

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
runescape 3 updates is more aimed for

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.460 
runescape 3 updates is more aimed for
new<00:03:16.200> players<00:03:16.500> that<00:03:17.280> are<00:03:17.959> trying<00:03:18.959> to<00:03:19.200> find<00:03:19.410> a

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:19.470 
new players that are trying to find a

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.100 
new players that are trying to find a
new<00:03:19.620> game<00:03:19.829> and<00:03:20.070> they<00:03:20.340> see<00:03:20.730> runescape<00:03:21.329> and<00:03:21.540> vcd

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
new game and they see runescape and vcd

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:24.500 
new game and they see runescape and vcd
that<00:03:22.680> it<00:03:22.829> has<00:03:23.040> really<00:03:23.459> good<00:03:23.610> graphics<00:03:24.120> it

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:24.510 
that it has really good graphics it

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:27.800 
that it has really good graphics it
might<00:03:24.780> be<00:03:24.959> more<00:03:25.260> willing<00:03:25.560> to<00:03:26.549> try<00:03:27.120> it<00:03:27.180> out<00:03:27.299> then

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:27.810 
might be more willing to try it out then

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:30.530 
might be more willing to try it out then
with<00:03:28.739> the<00:03:28.860> currency<00:03:29.519> but<00:03:29.910> for<00:03:30.120> all<00:03:30.269> player

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
with the currency but for all player

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.280 
with the currency but for all player
don't<00:03:30.959> really<00:03:31.230> think<00:03:32.570> makes<00:03:33.570> that<00:03:33.840> much<00:03:34.019> of<00:03:34.200> a

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:34.290 
don't really think makes that much of a

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.259 
don't really think makes that much of a
difference<00:03:34.320> of<00:03:34.799> course<00:03:34.980> free<00:03:35.340> draft<00:03:35.640> better

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
difference of course free draft better

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:38.240 
difference of course free draft better
graphics<00:03:36.750> is<00:03:36.870> good<00:03:37.140> but<00:03:37.620> if<00:03:37.739> I<00:03:37.860> have<00:03:38.010> to<00:03:38.040> choose

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:38.250 
graphics is good but if I have to choose

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:40.880 
graphics is good but if I have to choose
between<00:03:38.579> better<00:03:39.030> graphics<00:03:39.600> or<00:03:39.870> better<00:03:40.470> game

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:40.890 
between better graphics or better game

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:44.210 
between better graphics or better game
mechanics<00:03:41.430> then<00:03:42.090> I<00:03:42.209> will<00:03:42.359> obviously<00:03:43.160> get<00:03:44.160> the

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:44.220 
mechanics then I will obviously get the

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.120 
mechanics then I will obviously get the
better<00:03:44.730> game<00:03:45.180> mechanics<00:03:45.780> that's<00:03:46.200> how<00:03:46.410> I<00:03:46.709> play

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:47.130 
better game mechanics that's how I play

00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:51.680 
better game mechanics that's how I play
games<00:03:47.390> and<00:03:49.040> yeah<00:03:50.040> over<00:03:50.340> the<00:03:50.459> last<00:03:50.700> year's<00:03:51.239> it's

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
games and yeah over the last year's it's

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:54.289 
games and yeah over the last year's it's
kind<00:03:51.900> of<00:03:51.959> obvious<00:03:52.140> that<00:03:52.739> runescape<00:03:53.730> wall<00:03:53.970> jack

00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:54.299 
kind of obvious that runescape wall jack

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:57.830 
kind of obvious that runescape wall jack
x<00:03:54.510> is<00:03:54.630> trying<00:03:55.049> to<00:03:55.200> make<00:03:55.549> runescape<00:03:56.549> more<00:03:57.540> like

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:57.840 
x is trying to make runescape more like

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.199 
x is trying to make runescape more like
other<00:03:58.140> MMOs<00:03:58.799> I<00:03:59.010> mean<00:03:59.459> that<00:03:59.609> means<00:03:59.760> the<00:03:59.940> friends

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:00.209 
other MMOs I mean that means the friends

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:03.170 
other MMOs I mean that means the friends
between<00:04:00.560> runescape<00:04:01.560> and<00:04:01.769> other<00:04:02.040> MMOs<00:04:02.730> is

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:03.180 
between runescape and other MMOs is

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.199 
between runescape and other MMOs is
first<00:04:03.959> of<00:04:04.079> all<00:04:04.170> the<00:04:04.470> combat<00:04:04.980> system<00:04:05.209> so

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:06.209 
first of all the combat system so

00:04:06.209 --> 00:04:09.710 
first of all the combat system so
especially<00:04:06.510> before<00:04:07.160> EOC<00:04:08.390> runescape<00:04:09.390> combat

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:09.720 
especially before EOC runescape combat

00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.650 
especially before EOC runescape combat
system<00:04:10.109> really<00:04:10.500> well<00:04:11.459> you<00:04:11.670> couldn't<00:04:12.120> compare

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:12.660 
system really well you couldn't compare

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:15.020 
system really well you couldn't compare
it<00:04:12.780> to<00:04:13.079> other<00:04:13.109> animals<00:04:13.980> I<00:04:14.100> mean<00:04:14.280> you<00:04:14.850> have<00:04:15.000> no

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
it to other animals I mean you have no

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:18.080 
it to other animals I mean you have no
class<00:04:15.480> you<00:04:15.540> have<00:04:15.870> no<00:04:16.039> customization<00:04:17.039> with<00:04:18.000> the

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:18.090 
class you have no customization with the

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.900 
class you have no customization with the
armors<00:04:18.510> you<00:04:19.289> have<00:04:19.440> protect<00:04:19.979> from<00:04:20.280> Millie<00:04:20.609> that

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:20.910 
armors you have protect from Millie that

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:24.230 
armors you have protect from Millie that
removes<00:04:21.539> all<00:04:21.690> damage<00:04:22.560> from<00:04:23.430> Millie<00:04:23.849> monster<00:04:24.210> I

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:24.240 
removes all damage from Millie monster I

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:26.780 
removes all damage from Millie monster I
mean<00:04:24.479> it's<00:04:24.659> just<00:04:25.140> broken<00:04:25.680> system

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:26.790 
mean it's just broken system

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:30.740 
mean it's just broken system
and<00:04:27.530> the<00:04:28.530> comet<00:04:28.920> system<00:04:29.370> turn-by-turn<00:04:30.090> well

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:30.750 
and the comet system turn-by-turn well

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:32.330 
and the comet system turn-by-turn well
it<00:04:30.900> can<00:04:31.170> be<00:04:31.320> good<00:04:31.620> well<00:04:31.830> it's<00:04:31.980> not<00:04:32.100> rly

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:32.340 
it can be good well it's not rly

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:35.410 
it can be good well it's not rly
turn-by-turn<00:04:32.670> but<00:04:33.150> it's<00:04:34.080> not<00:04:34.320> really<00:04:34.620> a

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:35.420 
turn-by-turn but it's not really a

00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:40.400 
turn-by-turn but it's not really a
active<00:04:36.420> I<00:04:36.780> would<00:04:37.500> say<00:04:37.710> so<00:04:39.140> yeah<00:04:40.140> you<00:04:40.200> can

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:40.410 
active I would say so yeah you can

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:42.440 
active I would say so yeah you can
actually<00:04:40.710> compare<00:04:41.190> it<00:04:41.310> to<00:04:41.460> other<00:04:41.490> MMOs<00:04:42.210> I'm

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:42.450 
actually compare it to other MMOs I'm

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:44.780 
actually compare it to other MMOs I'm
pretty<00:04:43.200> sure<00:04:43.440> that's<00:04:43.620> that's<00:04:44.250> the<00:04:44.400> reason<00:04:44.760> why

00:04:44.780 --> 00:04:44.790 
pretty sure that's that's the reason why

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:47.950 
pretty sure that's that's the reason why
they<00:04:45.120> release<00:04:45.480> you'll<00:04:46.410> see<00:04:46.590> it's<00:04:46.710> more<00:04:46.980> to<00:04:47.160> be

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:47.960 
they release you'll see it's more to be

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:51.200 
they release you'll see it's more to be
to<00:04:48.960> be<00:04:49.080> in<00:04:49.140> the<00:04:49.260> same<00:04:49.560> skill<00:04:49.980> of<00:04:50.280> other<00:04:50.670> MMOs

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:51.210 
to be in the same skill of other MMOs

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:54.740 
to be in the same skill of other MMOs
but<00:04:52.170> I<00:04:52.200> mean<00:04:52.880> for<00:04:53.880> your<00:04:53.970> players<00:04:54.270> I'm<00:04:54.570> sure

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:57.150 
that the EEOC version is way better but

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.960 
that the EEOC version is way better but
for<00:04:57.390> the<00:04:57.480> old<00:04:57.690> players<00:04:58.050> these<00:04:58.620> toes<00:04:59.280> runescape

00:04:59.960 --> 00:04:59.970 
for the old players these toes runescape

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:03.770 
for the old players these toes runescape

because in an aspect because of the
components<00:05:04.710> a<00:05:04.770> crappy<00:05:05.160> combat<00:05:05.670> system<00:05:06.090> but

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:06.600 
components a crappy combat system but

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:11.090 
components a crappy combat system but
it's<00:05:06.750> all<00:05:08.450> not<00:05:09.450> complex<00:05:10.020> combat<00:05:10.590> system<00:05:10.980> I

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:11.100 
it's all not complex combat system I

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:14.990 
it's all not complex combat system I
would<00:05:11.160> say<00:05:11.430> well<00:05:11.820> it's<00:05:11.970> good<00:05:12.180> for<00:05:14.000> certain

00:05:14.990 --> 00:05:15.000 
would say well it's good for certain

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.730 
would say well it's good for certain
type<00:05:15.210> of<00:05:15.240> people<00:05:15.780> but<00:05:16.050> for<00:05:16.080> other<00:05:16.410> type<00:05:16.710> of

people like me personally i prefer the

00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:21.950 
people like me personally i prefer the
combat<00:05:20.370> system<00:05:20.580> i<00:05:20.820> wouldn't<00:05:21.120> say<00:05:21.270> that<00:05:21.300> EOC<00:05:21.780> is

00:05:21.950 --> 00:05:21.960 
combat system i wouldn't say that EOC is

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:26.570 
combat system i wouldn't say that EOC is
good<00:05:23.360> because<00:05:24.360> well<00:05:24.800> I'm<00:05:25.800> sure<00:05:26.100> it's<00:05:26.370> more

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:26.580 
good because well I'm sure it's more

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:28.130 
good because well I'm sure it's more
entertaining<00:05:26.850> but<00:05:27.360> I'm<00:05:27.510> not<00:05:27.690> really<00:05:27.840> playing

00:05:28.130 --> 00:05:28.140 
entertaining but I'm not really playing

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:31.160 
entertaining but I'm not really playing
runescape<00:05:28.710> for<00:05:29.040> the<00:05:29.130> combat<00:05:29.640> even<00:05:30.180> EOC<00:05:30.750> I<00:05:30.780> mean

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:31.170 
runescape for the combat even EOC I mean

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:33.590 
runescape for the combat even EOC I mean
it's<00:05:31.410> not<00:05:31.680> really<00:05:32.040> deep<00:05:32.490> enough<00:05:32.910> for<00:05:33.450> me

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:33.600 
it's not really deep enough for me

there's real customization different

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:41.960 
there's real customization different
class<00:05:39.270> different<00:05:39.780> things<00:05:40.050> to<00:05:40.260> do<00:05:40.410> I<00:05:40.730> mean<00:05:41.730> you

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:41.970 
class different things to do I mean you

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:44.210 
class different things to do I mean you
can<00:05:42.120> actually<00:05:42.480> compare<00:05:42.900> you<00:05:43.170> see<00:05:43.440> even<00:05:43.560> you'll

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:44.220 
can actually compare you see even you'll

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:47.150 
can actually compare you see even you'll
see<00:05:44.580> with<00:05:44.820> part<00:05:45.570> of<00:05:45.630> Exile<00:05:45.990> it<00:05:46.230> just<00:05:46.830> doesn't

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:47.160 
see with part of Exile it just doesn't

00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:52.910 
see with part of Exile it just doesn't
really<00:05:47.310> scale<00:05:47.670> um<00:05:50.330> what<00:05:51.330> was<00:05:51.480> I<00:05:51.600> saying<00:05:51.860> so<00:05:52.860> you

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:52.920 
really scale um what was I saying so you

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:54.770 
really scale um what was I saying so you
had<00:05:53.040> a<00:05:53.070> comeback<00:05:53.520> part<00:05:53.730> oh<00:05:53.850> yeah<00:05:54.000> the<00:05:54.570> other

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:54.780 
had a comeback part oh yeah the other

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:56.690 
had a comeback part oh yeah the other
big<00:05:55.140> difference<00:05:55.620> between<00:05:55.770> runescape<00:05:56.490> and

00:05:56.690 --> 00:05:56.700 
big difference between runescape and

00:05:56.700 --> 00:06:00.830 
big difference between runescape and
other<00:05:57.060> MMOs<00:05:57.720> is<00:05:58.080> the<00:05:58.770> graphics<00:05:59.340> and<00:05:59.840> i'm

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:00.840 
other MMOs is the graphics and i'm

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:02.660 
other MMOs is the graphics and i'm
pretty<00:06:01.260> sure<00:06:01.560> that<00:06:01.590> they<00:06:01.830> are<00:06:01.860> working<00:06:02.160> right

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:02.670 
pretty sure that they are working right

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:06.020 
pretty sure that they are working right
now<00:06:02.700> on<00:06:03.030> the<00:06:03.240> graphics<00:06:03.720> to<00:06:03.930> solve<00:06:04.320> well<00:06:05.070> not

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:06.030 
now on the graphics to solve well not

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:08.120 
now on the graphics to solve well not
really<00:06:06.090> to<00:06:06.420> Seoul<00:06:06.720> but<00:06:06.960> to<00:06:07.200> be<00:06:07.680> in<00:06:07.710> the<00:06:07.890> same

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:08.130 
really to Seoul but to be in the same

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:11.180 
really to Seoul but to be in the same
scale<00:06:08.460> that<00:06:08.670> other<00:06:08.910> MMOs<00:06:09.650> to<00:06:10.650> do<00:06:10.800> this<00:06:10.950> they

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:11.190 
scale that other MMOs to do this they

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:13.990 
scale that other MMOs to do this they
need<00:06:11.220> to<00:06:12.000> move<00:06:12.150> on<00:06:12.300> to<00:06:12.450> a<00:06:12.480> new<00:06:12.710> technology<00:06:13.710> and

00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:14.000 
need to move on to a new technology and

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.330 
need to move on to a new technology and
they<00:06:15.000> need<00:06:15.180> to<00:06:15.540> spend<00:06:16.080> a<00:06:16.140> lot<00:06:16.320> of<00:06:16.500> money<00:06:17.160> and

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:17.340 
they need to spend a lot of money and

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:20.120 
they need to spend a lot of money and
effort<00:06:17.820> on<00:06:17.940> doing<00:06:18.480> so<00:06:18.750> so<00:06:19.680> yeah<00:06:19.800> that's<00:06:19.920> pretty

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:20.130 
effort on doing so so yeah that's pretty

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:21.970 
effort on doing so so yeah that's pretty
much<00:06:20.550> it<00:06:20.670> about<00:06:21.000> what<00:06:21.240> I<00:06:21.270> think<00:06:21.390> about
