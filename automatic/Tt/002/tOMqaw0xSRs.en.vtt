apparently the only thing i don't know
if<00:02:05.909> this<00:02:06.030> is<00:02:06.090> still<00:02:06.299> a<00:02:06.630> broken<00:02:07.500> thing<00:02:08.129> but

00:02:08.389 --> 00:02:08.399 
if this is still a broken thing but

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:10.609

do<00:02:12.450> depend<00:02:12.810> on

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.180 
do depend on

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.750 
do depend on
uncle<00:02:13.930> bluetooth<00:02:14.379> audio<00:02:14.650> other<00:02:15.370> than<00:02:15.579> that<00:02:15.730> I

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:15.760 
uncle bluetooth audio other than that I

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:17.490 
uncle bluetooth audio other than that I
definitely<00:02:16.329> recommend<00:02:16.689> giving<00:02:17.079> this<00:02:17.319> a<00:02:17.379> try

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:17.500
