chocolate milk it has the same

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:09.670 
chocolate milk it has the same
carbohydrate<00:01:05.269> to<00:01:05.540> protein<00:01:07.360> ratio<00:01:08.619> that<00:01:09.619> is

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 
carbohydrate to protein ratio that is

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.990 
carbohydrate to protein ratio that is
needed<00:01:10.159> by<00:01:10.460> the<00:01:10.520> body<00:01:10.909> to<00:01:11.780> repair<00:01:12.650> the<00:01:13.520> muscle

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:14.000 
needed by the body to repair the muscle

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.399 
needed by the body to repair the muscle
tissue<00:01:14.330> that<00:01:15.140> was<00:01:15.439> damaged<00:01:16.100> and<00:01:16.510> your<00:01:17.510> in<00:01:18.380> your

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:18.409 
tissue that was damaged and your in your

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:21.399 
tissue that was damaged and your in your
work<00:01:18.740> of<00:01:18.890> it<00:01:18.979> you<00:01:19.070> just<00:01:19.100> did<00:01:19.430> so<00:01:20.299> the<00:01:21.170> key<00:01:21.380> is

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:21.409 
work of it you just did so the key is

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:23.679 
work of it you just did so the key is
that<00:01:21.680> there's<00:01:22.250> like<00:01:22.400> a<00:01:22.430> window<00:01:22.820> of<00:01:22.850> time<00:01:23.210> when

00:01:23.679 --> 00:01:23.689 
that there's like a window of time when

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:26.980 
that there's like a window of time when
the<00:01:23.810> body<00:01:23.990> is<00:01:24.110> breast<00:01:24.500> them<00:01:24.799> rest<00:01:25.869> there<00:01:26.869> the

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
the body is breast them rest there the

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.020 
the body is breast them rest there the
bottles<00:01:27.439> will<00:01:27.560> keep<00:01:27.710> it<00:01:27.830> in<00:01:27.890> nail<00:01:28.070> here<00:01:28.460> when

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:29.030 
bottles will keep it in nail here when

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:33.039 
bottles will keep it in nail here when
the<00:01:29.180> body<00:01:29.420> is<00:01:29.720> best<00:01:30.579> receptive<00:01:31.579> to<00:01:32.299> the

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:33.049 
the body is best receptive to the

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:36.219 
the body is best receptive to the
infusion<00:01:33.829> of<00:01:34.420> the<00:01:35.420> protein<00:01:35.929> and<00:01:36.200> the

00:01:36.219 --> 00:01:36.229 
infusion of the protein and the

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:38.770 
infusion of the protein and the
synthesis<00:01:37.130> in<00:01:37.340> the<00:01:37.549> muscle<00:01:37.880> cell<00:01:38.030> so<00:01:38.390> you've

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:38.780 
synthesis in the muscle cell so you've

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:40.810 
synthesis in the muscle cell so you've
got<00:01:38.810> that<00:01:39.140> little<00:01:39.469> small<00:01:39.740> bundle<00:01:40.039> time<00:01:40.340> that

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:40.820 
got that little small bundle time that

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.899 
got that little small bundle time that
might<00:01:41.090> sound<00:01:41.420> familiar<00:01:41.719> it's<00:01:42.649> because<00:01:42.909> little

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:43.909 
might sound familiar it's because little

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:49.870 
might sound familiar it's because little
homeboy<00:01:44.329> after<00:01:44.899> every<00:01:45.319> p90x<00:01:47.859> workout<00:01:48.859> he<00:01:49.670> said

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880 
homeboy after every p90x workout he said

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.700 
homeboy after every p90x workout he said
the<00:01:49.969> same<00:01:50.149> thing<00:01:50.450> he's<00:01:50.689> talking<00:01:51.170> about<00:01:51.229> the

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:51.710 
the same thing he's talking about the

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.069 
the same thing he's talking about the
recovery<00:01:52.219> formula<00:01:52.759> so<00:01:53.479> basically<00:01:53.960> it's<00:01:54.049> the

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:54.079 
recovery formula so basically it's the

00:01:54.079 --> 00:01:55.660 
recovery formula so basically it's the
same<00:01:54.170> thing<00:01:54.380> you<00:01:54.859> know<00:01:54.979> you<00:01:55.039> can<00:01:55.490> buy<00:01:55.609> the

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:55.670 
same thing you know you can buy the

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.609 
same thing you know you can buy the
recovery<00:01:56.149> formula<00:01:56.479> or<00:01:56.780> you<00:01:57.139> can<00:01:57.259> get<00:01:57.380> you<00:01:57.469> some

00:01:57.609 --> 00:01:57.619 
recovery formula or you can get you some

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:00.010 
recovery formula or you can get you some
chocolate<00:01:58.009> milk<00:01:58.299> obviously<00:01:59.299> the<00:01:59.689> chocolate

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:00.020 
chocolate milk obviously the chocolate

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.109 
chocolate milk obviously the chocolate
milk<00:02:00.170> is<00:02:00.289> a<00:02:00.319> lot<00:02:00.499> cheaper<00:02:00.789> recovery<00:02:01.789> formula

00:02:02.109 --> 00:02:02.119 
milk is a lot cheaper recovery formula

00:02:02.119 --> 00:02:07.380 
milk is a lot cheaper recovery formula
though<00:02:02.450> is<00:02:02.689> nice<00:02:03.109> if<00:02:03.799> you<00:02:04.579> are<00:02:04.939> looking<00:02:05.780> at

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:07.390 
though is nice if you are looking at

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:09.580 
though is nice if you are looking at
situation<00:02:08.390> if<00:02:08.600> you<00:02:08.840> are<00:02:09.020> like<00:02:09.200> me<00:02:09.380> if<00:02:09.470> you
