00:00:54.439 --> 00:00:54.449 
way up to 128 million so you would be

00:00:54.449 --> 00:00:56.719 
way up to 128 million so you would be
there<00:00:54.690> for<00:00:54.959> a<00:00:54.989> while<00:00:55.229> but<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:56.129> original<00:00:56.609> way

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
to access these was instead of putting

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.729 
to access these was instead of putting
sonic<00:01:00.149> 2<00:01:00.329> or<00:01:00.479> Sonic<00:01:00.780> 3<00:01:01.109> in<00:01:01.229> Sonic<00:01:01.559> and<00:01:01.709> Knuckles

you'd<00:01:02.219> insert<00:01:02.670> Sonic<00:01:03.179> 1<00:01:03.569> what<00:01:04.350> this<00:01:04.530> would

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
you'd insert Sonic 1 what this would

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.040 
you'd insert Sonic 1 what this would
allow<00:01:04.979> you<00:01:05.040> to<00:01:05.309> do<00:01:05.489> was<00:01:06.060> to<00:01:06.090> just<00:01:06.510> play<00:01:06.750> blue

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
it's been a long time since I've done

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.010 
it's been a long time since I've done
this<00:01:14.250> but<00:01:14.520> I<00:01:14.580> also<00:01:14.850> believe<00:01:15.270> putting<00:01:15.750> any

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
this but I also believe putting any

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.170 
this but I also believe putting any
other<00:01:16.320> game<00:01:16.620> that<00:01:16.800> isn't<00:01:16.950> Sonic<00:01:17.460> related<00:01:17.850> into

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
other game that isn't Sonic related into

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.720 
other game that isn't Sonic related into
Sonic<00:01:18.420> and<00:01:18.660> Knuckles<00:01:18.710> gave<00:01:19.710> you<00:01:19.890> a<00:01:19.920> single

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:20.730 
Sonic and Knuckles gave you a single

00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:22.820 
Sonic and Knuckles gave you a single
blue<00:01:21.060> sphere<00:01:21.390> stage<00:01:21.750> and<00:01:22.050> a<00:01:22.110> code<00:01:22.410> that<00:01:22.620> went

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
blue sphere stage and a code that went

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:25.070 
blue sphere stage and a code that went
with<00:01:23.070> it<00:01:23.220> now<00:01:23.580> if<00:01:23.760> you<00:01:23.880> know<00:01:24.030> that<00:01:24.240> code<00:01:24.570> you

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.080 
with it now if you know that code you

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.260 
with it now if you know that code you
can<00:01:25.230> insert<00:01:25.620> it<00:01:25.830> into<00:01:25.980> this<00:01:26.370> game<00:01:26.700> and<00:01:27.060> it<00:01:27.150> will

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270 
can insert it into this game and it will

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.780 
can insert it into this game and it will
generate<00:01:27.510> that<00:01:28.200> level<00:01:28.620> for<00:01:28.650> you<00:01:29.160> but<00:01:29.670> of

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790 
generate that level for you but of

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.020 
generate that level for you but of
course<00:01:30.060> there's<00:01:30.570> about<00:01:31.070> 128<00:01:32.070> million<00:01:32.430> levels

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
course there's about 128 million levels

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.190 
course there's about 128 million levels
so<00:01:33.870> you're<00:01:34.140> not<00:01:34.290> gonna<00:01:34.560> know<00:01:34.830> every<00:01:35.340> code<00:01:36.200> but

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
so you're not gonna know every code but

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.810 
so you're not gonna know every code but
if<00:01:37.290> you<00:01:37.380> don't<00:01:37.620> want<00:01:37.800> to<00:01:37.920> play<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:38.340> millions

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
of almost randomly picked levels you can

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.590

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
actually had a chance to mess around

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.500 
actually had a chance to mess around
with<00:02:16.080> yet<00:02:16.560> is<00:02:16.800> that<00:02:17.280> it<00:02:17.550> actually<00:02:17.760> comes<00:02:18.269> with

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:21.090 
a level editor and apparently it's

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:23.000 
a level editor and apparently it's
pretty<00:02:21.180> simple<00:02:21.810> to<00:02:21.870> use<00:02:22.019> they<00:02:22.530> give<00:02:22.680> a<00:02:22.709> quick

pretty simple to use they give a quick

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.280 
pretty simple to use they give a quick

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459 
game all the time I had no idea what's

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:22.610 
game all the time I had no idea what's
going<00:03:20.730> on<00:03:20.880> now<00:03:21.540> they're<00:03:21.780> really<00:03:22.049> the<00:03:22.350> only

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
going on now they're really the only

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:24.600 
bugs that are kind of noticeable at the

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.390 
bugs that are kind of noticeable at the
moment<00:03:24.989> I<00:03:25.139> haven't<00:03:25.680> seen<00:03:25.920> anything<00:03:26.310> else

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.309 
moment I haven't seen anything else
that's<00:03:26.639> really<00:03:27.030> broken<00:03:27.420> the<00:03:27.630> game<00:03:27.780> in<00:03:27.989> any<00:03:28.109> way

00:03:28.309 --> 00:03:28.319 
that's really broken the game in any way

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:30.830 
that's really broken the game in any way
so<00:03:28.380> everything<00:03:29.220> seems<00:03:29.489> to<00:03:29.549> be<00:03:29.639> fine<00:03:29.970> there<00:03:30.750> are

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:30.840 
so everything seems to be fine there are

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:33.610 
so everything seems to be fine there are
two<00:03:31.019> suggestions<00:03:31.440> I<00:03:31.769> have<00:03:31.819> for<00:03:32.819> some<00:03:32.970> reason

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620 
two suggestions I have for some reason

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:36.349 
two suggestions I have for some reason
objects<00:03:34.620> in<00:03:34.709> the<00:03:34.829> background<00:03:35.060> seem<00:03:36.060> to<00:03:36.209> be

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:36.359 
objects in the background seem to be

00:03:36.359 --> 00:03:38.860 
objects in the background seem to be
very<00:03:36.569> kind<00:03:36.989> of<00:03:37.109> squashed<00:03:37.560> end

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
very kind of squashed end

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:42.130 
very kind of squashed end
they<00:03:39.500> look<00:03:39.739> weird<00:03:40.099> that<00:03:40.849> could<00:03:41.000> be<00:03:41.090> me<00:03:41.269> it<00:03:41.870> just
