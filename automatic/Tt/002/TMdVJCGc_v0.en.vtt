00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:14.629
 very simple Chickpeas 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:17.210
 ingredients we need are two 

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:18.830
 half boiled chickpea pots 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.750
 if you will not find them you can also 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:22.220
 know them you already know that the 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:24.320
 way of cost the chickpeas is 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:26.599
 getting them soaking in the night 

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:29.929
 previous and then cooking them with water and 

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:33.770
 leave then about half an hour as 

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:36.340
 minimum then oil water 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:40.400
 a little salt a little sugar 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:44.030

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:53.930
 then as a final chorizo 

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:55.760
 The first thing we have done has been to wash 

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:58.890
 well the chickpeas remove the broth 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:02.040
 with which the jars come and leave them 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:04.199
 we reserve now in a saucepan 

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:06.710
 we put a couple of tablespoons of oil 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:06.710
 olive 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:15.330
 when it takes temperature we add the 

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.330
 onion and garlic 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.750
 [Music] 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.380
 and real let's go a little bit 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.119
 and we enter with a little bit to pick up 

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.820
 onion and garlic we are going to add the 

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:46.469
 crushed tomato and it comes a few 

00:01:42.820 --> 00:01:46.469
 400 grams of crushed tomatoes 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.970
 we were a little salt 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.729
 and remember that whenever you use 

00:01:54.970 --> 00:02:00.729
 Tomato in any stew add 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:03.630
 always a little sugar to remove the 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:03.630
 tomato city 

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:15.100
 we have to let this suffer 

00:02:13.409 --> 00:02:17.700
 a little 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.700
 Y 

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:23.330
 well we have the sofrito done and 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:26.300
 now about this 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:29.830
 let's take three three tablespoons of 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.830
 chickpeas who had booked 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.030
 and we're just going to add 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.299
 it's a little turn 

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:52.090
 and we will add then about 700 

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.090
 milliliters of water 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:59.520
 approximately, it is not necessary that 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.870
 be exact with the water measurement 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.670
 Y 

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:06.440
 if then you see that you need more water 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:06.440
 it is added without any problem 

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:13.360
 and we're going to crush all this 

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:31.269
 [Applause] 

00:03:28.019 --> 00:03:33.069
 Well, we have already crushed it and 

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:37.500
 the chickpeas what we have achieved is 

00:03:33.069 --> 00:03:40.040
 that the oncenos are forced to look 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.040

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:46.200
 because nothing else now we throw our 

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.200
 chickpeas 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:05.340

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:09.010

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:13.510
 like a little tip of a teaspoon of 

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:13.510
 coffee 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.610
 a little parsley 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:29.080
 a little bit of salt because we have 

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:29.080
 added water 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:34.789

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:40.630

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:40.630
 of laurel 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:48.270
