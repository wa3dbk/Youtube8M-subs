 examination of the crusader euro and 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.539
 welcome I greet you now 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:21.990
 with a first wow edition after one 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.310
 short break yes this time you're done 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.289
 already heard after examining the 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.100
 crusader there is an ice 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.310
 crown ready 

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:31.949

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.539
 a bit hard alone and yes from the 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:38.550
 Degree of difficulty lies just now 

00:00:33.539 --> 00:00:40.139
 between culture and icc is located 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.940
 an ice crown I've said 

00:00:40.139 --> 00:00:43.769
 games here in terminology spec 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:45.899
 in my opinion, still on 

00:00:43.769 --> 00:00:47.940
 best for any actions just 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:50.549
 because there are quite a few in pdk 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:51.719
 Weapons gives the look pretty cool 

00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:54.600
 and offers, for example, for tomorrow 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:57.299
 we can and he could we 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:01.350
 have already decided and just 

00:00:57.299 --> 00:01:03.179
 for dermatology actually say already 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.760
 times because of the advantage because the first 

00:01:03.179 --> 00:01:07.770
 pass first phase for example a demon 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.900

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:11.760
 the damage carries the relatively fast 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.250
 Down available for the with the 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:17.700
 effortlessly revive without one 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:20.370
 to have splinters in stock or without 

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:22.710
 Everything is possible 

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:24.810
