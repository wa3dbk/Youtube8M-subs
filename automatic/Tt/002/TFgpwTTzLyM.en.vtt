my skin tends to get very very dry just

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:27.270 
my skin tends to get very very dry just
because<00:00:26.080> of<00:00:26.289> the<00:00:26.410> weather<00:00:26.560> changing<00:00:27.070> and<00:00:27.190> all

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:27.280 
because of the weather changing and all

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:29.520

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:31.510 
love the way that this is something that

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:32.819 
love the way that this is something that
I<00:00:31.630> can<00:00:31.810> put<00:00:31.960> on<00:00:32.020> my<00:00:32.110> skin<00:00:32.529> that<00:00:32.710> will

00:00:32.819 --> 00:00:32.829 
I can put on my skin that will

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:34.830 
I can put on my skin that will
moisturize<00:00:33.039> it<00:00:33.340> but<00:00:33.760> it<00:00:33.879> will<00:00:34.059> not<00:00:34.300> make<00:00:34.629> it

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:34.840 
moisturize it but it will not make it

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.260 
moisturize it but it will not make it
too<00:00:35.260> oily<00:00:35.620> or<00:00:35.950> greasy<00:00:35.980> it<00:00:36.520> gets<00:00:36.670> absorbed<00:00:36.850> into

like<00:01:18.579> either<00:01:18.789> ruin<00:01:19.209> them<00:01:19.389> in<00:01:19.630> the<00:01:19.749> wash<00:01:19.929> or<00:01:20.350> I

00:01:21.179 --> 00:01:21.189 
like either ruin them in the wash or I

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:23.429 
like either ruin them in the wash or I
lose<00:01:21.520> them<00:01:21.789> before<00:01:22.119> I<00:01:22.149> actually<00:01:22.359> get<00:01:22.689> to<00:01:22.749> run

is actually an eyeliner and I have

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:08.390 
is actually an eyeliner and I have
definitely<00:04:06.900> been<00:04:07.379> wearing<00:04:07.620> this<00:04:07.769> this<00:04:08.099> entire

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
definitely been wearing this this entire

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:11.149 
definitely been wearing this this entire
month<00:04:08.729> and<00:04:08.940> this<00:04:09.599> is<00:04:09.810> also<00:04:10.049> by<00:04:10.379> Clinique<00:04:10.799> it<00:04:10.979> is

00:04:11.149 --> 00:04:11.159 
month and this is also by Clinique it is

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:13.670 
month and this is also by Clinique it is
a<00:04:11.340> cream<00:04:11.729> shaper<00:04:12.090> for<00:04:12.209> eyes<00:04:12.389> in<00:04:12.810> the<00:04:13.079> number

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:13.680 
a cream shaper for eyes in the number

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.069 
a cream shaper for eyes in the number
105<00:04:14.190> the<00:04:14.519> color<00:04:14.729> is<00:04:14.940> chocolate<00:04:15.299> luster<00:04:15.870> and

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:16.079 
105 the color is chocolate luster and

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:17.990 
105 the color is chocolate luster and
the<00:04:16.500> reason<00:04:16.769> I<00:04:16.829> like<00:04:17.039> this<00:04:17.190> is<00:04:17.400> because<00:04:17.579> it<00:04:17.880> is

00:04:17.990 --> 00:04:18.000 
the reason I like this is because it is

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.949 
the reason I like this is because it is
a<00:04:18.030> light<00:04:18.389> brown

00:04:18.949 --> 00:04:18.959 
a light brown

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:21.379 
a light brown
color<00:04:19.079> but<00:04:19.319> it<00:04:19.410> has<00:04:19.530> sparkles<00:04:19.979> in<00:04:20.370> it<00:04:20.459> and<00:04:21.209> so

00:04:21.379 --> 00:04:21.389 
color but it has sparkles in it and so

00:04:21.389 --> 00:04:22.939 
color but it has sparkles in it and so
I've<00:04:21.509> definitely<00:04:21.720> just<00:04:22.319> been<00:04:22.470> lining<00:04:22.680> my

00:04:22.939 --> 00:04:22.949 
I've definitely just been lining my

00:04:22.949 --> 00:04:25.969 
I've definitely just been lining my
upper<00:04:22.979> and<00:04:23.669> lower<00:04:24.030> wat<00:04:24.330> excuse<00:04:25.080> me<00:04:25.229> lash<00:04:25.680> lines

00:04:25.969 --> 00:04:25.979

00:04:25.979 --> 00:04:27.680 
upper and lower wat excuse me lash lines
with<00:04:26.460> this<00:04:26.669> and<00:04:26.880> then<00:04:27.030> blending<00:04:27.389> it<00:04:27.389> out<00:04:27.539> with

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:27.690 
with this and then blending it out with

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:29.240 
with this and then blending it out with
my<00:04:27.750> finger<00:04:28.020> and<00:04:28.139> I<00:04:28.229> really<00:04:28.590> like<00:04:28.770> the<00:04:28.919> effect

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:29.250 
my finger and I really like the effect

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:31.670 
my finger and I really like the effect
that<00:04:29.370> it<00:04:29.520> gives<00:04:29.810> so<00:04:30.810> I<00:04:30.840> definitely<00:04:31.319> really

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:31.680 
that it gives so I definitely really

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.860 
that it gives so I definitely really
recommend<00:04:32.099> this<00:04:32.160> color<00:04:32.430> as<00:04:32.610> well<00:04:32.639> because<00:04:33.210> the

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:33.870 
recommend this color as well because the

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:36.230 
recommend this color as well because the
sparkles<00:04:34.590> in<00:04:34.710> it<00:04:34.800> is<00:04:35.550> something<00:04:35.880> that<00:04:36.000> I<00:04:36.150> think

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:36.240 
sparkles in it is something that I think

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.469 
sparkles in it is something that I think
is<00:04:36.449> very<00:04:36.630> festive<00:04:37.259> for<00:04:37.590> the<00:04:38.130> upcoming<00:04:38.550> winter

00:04:39.469 --> 00:04:39.479
