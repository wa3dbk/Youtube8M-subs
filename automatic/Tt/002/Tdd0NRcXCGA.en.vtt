succession it gives the animation the

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.490 
succession it gives the animation the
illusion<00:02:51.790> of<00:02:51.880> movement<00:02:52.150> this<00:02:52.840> technique<00:02:53.290> is

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
illusion of movement this technique is

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:58.740 
illusion of movement this technique is
called<00:02:53.790> stop-motion<00:02:57.360> this<00:02:58.360> is<00:02:58.450> what<00:02:58.600> we're

how much actual animation we get to do

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.240 
how much actual animation we get to do
probably<00:04:09.750> get<00:04:09.959> about<00:04:10.200> half<00:04:10.620> a<00:04:10.740> second<00:04:11.100> done

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:11.250

movements isn't that that's it just turn
them<00:04:50.880> towards<00:04:51.150> the<00:04:51.210> camera<00:04:51.390> that's<00:04:52.260> great

00:04:52.670 --> 00:04:52.680 
them towards the camera that's great

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:54.350 
them towards the camera that's great
so<00:04:52.800> let's<00:04:53.010> get<00:04:53.160> Merlin<00:04:53.580> in<00:04:53.700> just<00:04:53.940> to<00:04:54.060> give<00:04:54.210> it<00:04:54.300> a

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:54.360 
so let's get Merlin in just to give it a

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:55.909 
so let's get Merlin in just to give it a
final<00:04:54.570> hydrate<00:04:54.990> before<00:04:55.110> we<00:04:55.320> start<00:04:55.590> animating

00:04:55.909 --> 00:04:55.919 
final hydrate before we start animating

00:04:55.919 --> 00:04:59.260 
final hydrate before we start animating
I<00:04:56.250> know<00:04:56.550> this<00:04:56.700> huh

00:04:59.260 --> 00:04:59.270 

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:01.820 

Josh<00:05:00.270> I<00:05:00.419> think<00:05:00.450> Wallace's<00:05:01.169> eyeline<00:05:01.530> needs<00:05:01.740> to

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:01.830 
Josh I think Wallace's eyeline needs to

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:03.380 
Josh I think Wallace's eyeline needs to
come<00:05:02.010> down<00:05:02.040> a<00:05:02.280> little<00:05:02.550> bit<00:05:02.760> more<00:05:02.940> looks<00:05:03.210> like

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:03.390 
come down a little bit more looks like

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:04.909 
come down a little bit more looks like
he's<00:05:03.570> some<00:05:03.840> looking<00:05:04.110> up<00:05:04.229> into<00:05:04.410> the<00:05:04.500> sky

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:04.919 
he's some looking up into the sky

00:05:04.919 --> 00:05:07.159 
he's some looking up into the sky
okay<00:05:05.400> mister<00:05:05.700> look<00:05:05.850> so<00:05:06.330> the<00:05:06.450> visit<00:05:06.690> he's<00:05:06.870> where

00:05:07.159 --> 00:05:07.169 
okay mister look so the visit he's where

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:10.320 
he's going on that that's the ticket

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:13.300

yeah

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:13.310 

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:15.070 

that<00:05:14.030> tiny<00:05:14.210> little<00:05:14.300> bit<00:05:14.510> that<00:05:14.660> she<00:05:14.690> does<00:05:14.900> make

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:15.080 
that tiny little bit that she does make

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:16.720 
that tiny little bit that she does make
a<00:05:15.110> lot<00:05:15.440> of<00:05:15.500> difference<00:05:15.770> there<00:05:16.070> it's<00:05:16.280> the<00:05:16.370> final

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:16.730 
a lot of difference there it's the final

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:19.060 
a lot of difference there it's the final
couple<00:05:17.000> of<00:05:17.060> percent<00:05:17.360> really<00:05:17.980> attention<00:05:18.980> to

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:19.070 
couple of percent really attention to

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:21.430 
couple of percent really attention to
detail<00:05:19.370> and<00:05:19.580> really<00:05:19.850> takes<00:05:20.780> it<00:05:20.960> from<00:05:21.080> looking

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:21.440 
detail and really takes it from looking

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:23.830 
detail and really takes it from looking
maybe<00:05:22.010> a<00:05:22.160> bit<00:05:22.310> muddly<00:05:22.700> to<00:05:22.880> something<00:05:23.150> that<00:05:23.180> you

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:23.840 
maybe a bit muddly to something that you

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:25.270 
maybe a bit muddly to something that you
start<00:05:24.110> to<00:05:24.200> believe<00:05:24.320> in<00:05:24.590> ya<00:05:24.770> know<00:05:24.920> it's<00:05:25.100> those

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:25.280 
start to believe in ya know it's those

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.060 
start to believe in ya know it's those
little<00:05:25.520> bits<00:05:25.820> that<00:05:25.910> we<00:05:26.090> really<00:05:26.390> strive<00:05:26.720> for

amazing<00:06:19.960> we're<00:06:20.960> gonna<00:06:21.050> get<00:06:21.230> the<00:06:21.350> frame<00:06:21.530> now<00:06:22.300> so

00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:23.300 
amazing we're gonna get the frame now so

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:24.550 
amazing we're gonna get the frame now so
now<00:06:23.450> we've<00:06:23.570> taken<00:06:23.750> two<00:06:24.020> frames<00:06:24.320> through

00:06:24.550 --> 00:06:24.560 
now we've taken two frames through

now we've taken two frames through
phrase<00:06:24.860> now<00:06:25.790> we<00:06:25.850> need<00:06:26.300> to<00:06:26.420> start<00:06:26.720> that<00:06:26.810> slow

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:27.170 
phrase now we need to start that slow

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:29.050 
phrase now we need to start that slow
moving<00:06:27.440> up<00:06:27.620> the<00:06:27.740> hill<00:06:27.890> so<00:06:28.220> this<00:06:28.400> whole<00:06:28.610> bar<00:06:28.850> is

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:29.060 
moving up the hill so this whole bar is

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:30.910 
moving up the hill so this whole bar is
gonna<00:06:29.240> go<00:06:29.420> up<00:06:29.510> a<00:06:29.600> little<00:06:29.780> bit<00:06:30.020> probably<00:06:30.410> only<00:06:30.560> a

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:30.920 
gonna go up a little bit probably only a

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:33.790 
gonna go up a little bit probably only a
centimeter<00:06:31.490> that's<00:06:31.970> great<00:06:32.390> so<00:06:33.140> now<00:06:33.290> you<00:06:33.650> can

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:33.800 
centimeter that's great so now you can

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:35.440 
centimeter that's great so now you can
carry<00:06:34.040> on<00:06:34.190> that<00:06:34.280> action<00:06:34.670> I<00:06:34.820> think<00:06:34.850> that's<00:06:35.240> good

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:35.450 
carry on that action I think that's good
