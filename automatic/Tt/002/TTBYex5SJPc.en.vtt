00:03:43.979 --> 00:03:43.989 
right here that one they're a lot

00:03:43.989 --> 00:03:45.270 
right here that one they're a lot
brighter<00:03:44.260> so<00:03:44.560> fiddle<00:03:44.860> around<00:03:44.950> with<00:03:45.190> the

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.280 
brighter so fiddle around with the

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:47.220 
brighter so fiddle around with the
backdrops<00:03:45.850> fiddle<00:03:46.420> around<00:03:46.480> with<00:03:46.690> what<00:03:46.989> dirt

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:47.230 
backdrops fiddle around with what dirt

00:03:47.230 --> 00:03:49.260 
backdrops fiddle around with what dirt
shows<00:03:47.500> and<00:03:47.770> what<00:03:47.890> dirt<00:03:48.070> doesn't<00:03:48.430> show<00:03:48.580> but

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:49.270 
shows and what dirt doesn't show but

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:51.120 
shows and what dirt doesn't show but
there<00:03:49.570> you<00:03:49.690> go<00:03:49.870> let's<00:03:50.470> go<00:03:50.650> back<00:03:50.860> through<00:03:51.100> again

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.130 
there you go let's go back through again

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:53.100 
there you go let's go back through again
there<00:03:51.700> is<00:03:51.820> no<00:03:52.000> way<00:03:52.120> out<00:03:52.150> of<00:03:52.360> this<00:03:52.600> one<00:03:52.870> because

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:53.110 
there is no way out of this one because

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:54.870 
there is no way out of this one because
I<00:03:53.380> made<00:03:53.590> it<00:03:53.680> backwards<00:03:54.130> so<00:03:54.220> let's<00:03:54.550> just<00:03:54.760> go

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:54.880 
I made it backwards so let's just go

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:59.670 
I made it backwards so let's just go
like<00:03:55.090> this<00:03:56.130> and<00:03:57.130> there<00:03:58.000> you<00:03:58.090> go<00:03:58.270> but<00:03:59.110> I<00:03:59.320> find

00:03:59.670 --> 00:03:59.680 
like this and there you go but I find

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.390 
like this and there you go but I find
that<00:03:59.770> you<00:03:59.860> can<00:04:00.070> fiddle<00:04:00.310> around<00:04:00.489> with<00:04:00.940> that

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
that you can fiddle around with that

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:05.250 
that you can fiddle around with that
like<00:04:03.400> this<00:04:04.030> right<00:04:04.329> here<00:04:04.600> if<00:04:04.690> you<00:04:04.870> were<00:04:04.959> to<00:04:05.079> go

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:05.260 
like this right here if you were to go

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.500 
like this right here if you were to go
in<00:04:05.500> and<00:04:05.739> cover<00:04:06.280> that<00:04:06.400> it<00:04:06.820> makes<00:04:07.030> it<00:04:07.150> a<00:04:07.239> lot<00:04:07.450> more

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:07.510 
in and cover that it makes it a lot more

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:08.160 
in and cover that it makes it a lot more
concealed

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.170

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:10.959 
old the darker it is behind it but again

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:12.420 
old the darker it is behind it but again
there's<00:04:11.319> nothing<00:04:11.680> that<00:04:11.830> I<00:04:11.860> could<00:04:12.190> really

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:12.430 
there's nothing that I could really

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:13.770 
there's nothing that I could really
explain<00:04:12.849> this<00:04:13.060> room<00:04:13.270> is<00:04:13.360> a<00:04:13.420> little<00:04:13.510> bright
