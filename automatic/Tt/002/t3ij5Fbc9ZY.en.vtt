00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:10.149

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:20.550
 and what's happening, and since we 're in a 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.079
 new top trite and let's give it 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.449
 strong with those talls and those knives 

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:26.279
 ballistic bear go with the 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.130
 number 5 that we have here Mr. Diego 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.869
 he charges that his ax would be shot 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.260
 make a piece of across the map in 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.790
 this map that is my boat fuck I never 

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.219
 I will tire of saying it clearly is that you 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.710
 you think there's that for being there fighting and 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:43.050
 throwing bullets and axes is part of yours 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.789
 since you are invited, yes 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.130
 but good has stopped bullshit 

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:48.930
 because we see here a great across the map 

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:51.120
 that you only throw enemy that was 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.540
 waiting for your little parcel and you 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.210
 well your online package 

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:57.950
 and if we go there and record, it 's all with 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:00.020
 the three sectors that stop us because 

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:01.700
 we go there with number four and we're going 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:04.220

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.520
 destroyed by 5 there is an uncle 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:13.310
 wants to escape via via river 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:15.680
 up directly to run away from this 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:18.200
 ax but I can not because it crosses in 

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.210
 his way yes indeed is the little man 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:23.640
