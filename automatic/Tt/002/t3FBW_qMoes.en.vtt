quite<00:01:56.480> a<00:01:56.570> good<00:01:56.630> mic<00:01:57.050> on<00:01:57.290> it<00:01:57.470> and<00:01:57.650> it<00:01:57.980> doesn't

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
quite a good mic on it and it doesn't

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.130 
quite a good mic on it and it doesn't
really<00:01:58.430> matter<00:01:58.730> where<00:01:59.060> you<00:01:59.090> point<00:01:59.240> it<00:01:59.690> still

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
really matter where you point it still

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:01.570 
really matter where you point it still
picks<00:02:00.380> up<00:02:00.560> your<00:02:00.680> voice<00:02:00.860> really<00:02:01.100> really<00:02:01.430> well

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:01.580 
picks up your voice really really well

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:03.550 
picks up your voice really really well
even<00:02:02.120> though<00:02:02.270> it's<00:02:02.450> only<00:02:02.600> mono<00:02:02.960> which<00:02:03.260> I<00:02:03.440> was

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560 
even though it's only mono which I was

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.950 
even though it's only mono which I was
quite<00:02:03.770> impressed<00:02:03.890> with<00:02:04.310> 1080p<00:02:05.120> is<00:02:05.360> relatively

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:05.960 
quite impressed with 1080p is relatively

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:08.559 
quite impressed with 1080p is relatively
good<00:02:06.260> I<00:02:06.500> would<00:02:07.130> say<00:02:07.370> is<00:02:07.670> a<00:02:07.700> little<00:02:08.179> bit<00:02:08.330> better

00:02:08.559 --> 00:02:08.569 
good I would say is a little bit better

00:02:08.569 --> 00:02:11.020 
good I would say is a little bit better
than<00:02:08.989> the<00:02:09.050> Kodak<00:02:09.649> cameras<00:02:10.130> but<00:02:10.580> it<00:02:10.700> doesn't

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
than the Kodak cameras but it doesn't

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:12.850 
than the Kodak cameras but it doesn't
have<00:02:11.180> image<00:02:11.480> stabilization<00:02:11.870> not<00:02:12.560> that<00:02:12.740> that

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:12.860 
have image stabilization not that that

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.059 
have image stabilization not that that
makes<00:02:13.069> a<00:02:13.280> real<00:02:13.730> difference<00:02:13.760> in<00:02:14.600> the<00:02:14.660> 10

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:15.069 
makes a real difference in the 10

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:18.989 
makes a real difference in the 10
p<00:02:15.310> but<00:02:15.939> it<00:02:16.629> does<00:02:16.870> do<00:02:17.079> quite<00:02:17.469> good<00:02:17.680> 1080p<00:02:18.280> the

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:18.999 
p but it does do quite good 1080p the

00:02:18.999 --> 00:02:22.319 
p but it does do quite good 1080p the
low<00:02:19.239> light<00:02:19.530> when<00:02:20.530> it<00:02:20.650> does<00:02:20.829> focus<00:02:21.129> is<00:02:21.700> really

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:22.329 
low light when it does focus is really

00:02:22.329 --> 00:02:24.629 
low light when it does focus is really
really<00:02:22.480> good<00:02:22.749> and<00:02:22.989> I<00:02:23.200> found<00:02:23.530> it<00:02:23.769> to<00:02:23.950> have<00:02:24.370> a

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:24.639 
really good and I found it to have a

00:02:24.639 --> 00:02:26.849 
really good and I found it to have a
better<00:02:25.150> quality<00:02:25.450> low<00:02:25.870> light<00:02:26.139> than<00:02:26.439> the<00:02:26.530> kodak

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:26.859 
better quality low light than the kodak

00:02:26.859 --> 00:02:28.440 
better quality low light than the kodak
playsport<00:02:27.010> which<00:02:27.549> I<00:02:27.670> was<00:02:27.819> quite<00:02:28.060> surprised

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:28.450 
playsport which I was quite surprised

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.809 
playsport which I was quite surprised
that<00:02:28.689> the<00:02:29.139> the<00:02:29.650> quality<00:02:30.069> of<00:02:30.129> the<00:02:30.219> videos<00:02:30.579> are

00:02:30.809 --> 00:02:30.819 
that the the quality of the videos are

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:32.699 
that the the quality of the videos are
quite<00:02:31.150> good<00:02:31.180> but<00:02:31.689> I<00:02:31.780> did<00:02:31.989> find<00:02:32.230> it<00:02:32.469> a<00:02:32.530> little

00:02:32.699 --> 00:02:32.709 
quite good but I did find it a little

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:36.990 
quite good but I did find it a little
bit<00:02:32.920> grainy<00:02:33.189> in<00:02:33.459> some<00:02:34.109> situations<00:02:35.189> now<00:02:36.189> I<00:02:36.639> am

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:37.000 
bit grainy in some situations now I am

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.640 
bit grainy in some situations now I am
still<00:02:37.420> doing<00:02:37.569> tests<00:02:38.109> with<00:02:38.260> both<00:02:38.439> these

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:38.650 
still doing tests with both these

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.580 
still doing tests with both these
cameras<00:02:39.159> and<00:02:39.400> I'm<00:02:39.969> yet<00:02:40.239> to<00:02:40.269> do<00:02:40.540> a<00:02:40.569> test<00:02:40.989> as<00:02:41.319> far

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:41.590 
cameras and I'm yet to do a test as far

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.039 
cameras and I'm yet to do a test as far
as<00:02:41.799> the<00:02:42.430> image<00:02:42.669> stabilization<00:02:43.060> is<00:02:43.540> concerned

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:44.049 
as the image stabilization is concerned

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:46.259 
as the image stabilization is concerned
and<00:02:44.260> comparing<00:02:44.799> the<00:02:44.889> two<00:02:45.099> so<00:02:45.430> i'll<00:02:45.669> let<00:02:46.150> you

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:46.269 
and comparing the two so i'll let you

00:02:46.269 --> 00:02:48.479 
and comparing the two so i'll let you
guys<00:02:46.480> know<00:02:46.780> how<00:02:47.019> that<00:02:47.260> goes<00:02:47.469> so<00:02:48.159> that's<00:02:48.370> the

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:48.489 
guys know how that goes so that's the

00:02:48.489 --> 00:02:51.569 
guys know how that goes so that's the
bonuses<00:02:49.209> about<00:02:49.510> this<00:02:49.750> the<00:02:50.349> negatives<00:02:50.829> the

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:51.579 
bonuses about this the negatives the

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:53.909 
bonuses about this the negatives the
focusing<00:02:52.180> in<00:02:52.329> low<00:02:52.510> light<00:02:52.750> is<00:02:52.930> a<00:02:52.959> major<00:02:53.349> problem

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:53.919 
focusing in low light is a major problem

00:02:53.919 --> 00:02:56.550 
focusing in low light is a major problem
on<00:02:54.040> my<00:02:54.129> birthday<00:02:54.669> I<00:02:54.969> took<00:02:55.120> this<00:02:55.419> out<00:02:55.659> and<00:02:55.989> I<00:02:56.049> did

00:02:56.550 --> 00:02:56.560 
on my birthday I took this out and I did

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.670 
on my birthday I took this out and I did
a<00:02:56.590> lot<00:02:56.799> of<00:02:56.859> video<00:02:57.129> of<00:02:57.430> it<00:02:57.579> and<00:02:57.900> the<00:02:58.900> focusing

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
a lot of video of it and the focusing

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.619 
a lot of video of it and the focusing
was<00:02:59.980> a<00:03:00.010> problem<00:03:00.370> in<00:03:00.699> pretty<00:03:01.090> much<00:03:01.180> all<00:03:01.449> the

00:03:01.619 --> 00:03:01.629 
was a problem in pretty much all the

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:04.080 
was a problem in pretty much all the
videos<00:03:01.930> that<00:03:02.199> i<00:03:02.230> took<00:03:02.530> it<00:03:02.739> seems<00:03:03.459> to<00:03:03.819> just<00:03:04.000> want

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
videos that i took it seems to just want

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.209 
videos that i took it seems to just want
to<00:03:04.329> focus<00:03:04.510> on<00:03:04.810> everything<00:03:05.290> and<00:03:05.409> i<00:03:05.799> tried

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:06.219 
to focus on everything and i tried

00:03:06.219 --> 00:03:08.069 
to focus on everything and i tried
turning<00:03:06.579> the<00:03:06.939> image<00:03:07.120> stabilization<00:03:07.449> on<00:03:07.930> and

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:08.079 
turning the image stabilization on and

00:03:08.079 --> 00:03:10.409 
turning the image stabilization on and
off<00:03:08.169> and<00:03:08.469> the<00:03:09.370> face<00:03:09.579> detection<00:03:09.760> on<00:03:10.180> and<00:03:10.329> off

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:10.419 
off and the face detection on and off

00:03:10.419 --> 00:03:14.069 
off and the face detection on and off
and<00:03:10.689> in<00:03:11.650> certain<00:03:11.980> situations<00:03:12.310> it<00:03:12.909> did<00:03:13.659> seem<00:03:13.900> to

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:14.079 
and in certain situations it did seem to

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:17.429 
and in certain situations it did seem to
make<00:03:14.199> things<00:03:14.439> better<00:03:14.680> but<00:03:15.579> the<00:03:15.909> focus<00:03:16.180> in<00:03:16.569> for

00:03:17.429 --> 00:03:17.439 
make things better but the focus in for

00:03:17.439 --> 00:03:20.429 
make things better but the focus in for
me<00:03:17.620> it<00:03:18.040> would<00:03:18.340> be<00:03:18.579> a<00:03:18.609> major<00:03:19.209> put<00:03:19.599> off<00:03:19.780> I<00:03:20.019> have

00:03:20.429 --> 00:03:20.439 
me it would be a major put off I have

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:22.199 
me it would be a major put off I have
talked<00:03:20.709> sony<00:03:21.009> about<00:03:21.310> it<00:03:21.489> and<00:03:21.669> they<00:03:21.759> said<00:03:22.030> that

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:22.209 
talked sony about it and they said that

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:24.330 
talked sony about it and they said that
its<00:03:22.329> part<00:03:22.569> the<00:03:22.629> camera<00:03:23.049> it's<00:03:23.560> and<00:03:24.009> it's<00:03:24.159> the

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:24.340 
its part the camera it's and it's the

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.969 
its part the camera it's and it's the
way<00:03:24.489> that<00:03:24.699> the<00:03:24.819> camera<00:03:25.319> adjusts<00:03:26.319> to<00:03:26.500> the<00:03:26.680> light

00:03:26.969 --> 00:03:26.979 
way that the camera adjusts to the light

00:03:26.979 --> 00:03:28.830 
way that the camera adjusts to the light
in<00:03:27.189> situations<00:03:27.939> and<00:03:28.209> the<00:03:28.299> focus<00:03:28.689> in

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:28.840 
in situations and the focus in

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.199 
in situations and the focus in
situations<00:03:29.530> and<00:03:29.739> they<00:03:30.549> said<00:03:30.819> that<00:03:30.849> there

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:31.209 
situations and they said that there

00:03:31.209 --> 00:03:33.119 
situations and they said that there
isn't<00:03:31.479> really<00:03:31.629> a<00:03:31.870> firmware<00:03:32.290> update<00:03:32.620> that<00:03:32.979> they

00:03:33.119 --> 00:03:33.129 
isn't really a firmware update that they

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:35.879 
isn't really a firmware update that they
can<00:03:33.340> see<00:03:33.639> would<00:03:33.939> rectify<00:03:34.720> or<00:03:35.259> change<00:03:35.590> this

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:35.889 
can see would rectify or change this

00:03:35.889 --> 00:03:38.069 
can see would rectify or change this
thing<00:03:36.220> what<00:03:37.060> would<00:03:37.209> have<00:03:37.359> been<00:03:37.509> nice<00:03:37.720> as<00:03:37.959> if

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:38.079 
thing what would have been nice as if

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:40.619 
thing what would have been nice as if
they<00:03:38.229> put<00:03:38.500> a<00:03:38.530> manual<00:03:39.340> focus<00:03:40.120> on<00:03:40.269> it<00:03:40.419> or<00:03:40.569> a

00:03:40.619 --> 00:03:40.629 
they put a manual focus on it or a

00:03:40.629 --> 00:03:42.689 
they put a manual focus on it or a
button<00:03:41.409> where<00:03:41.739> you<00:03:41.889> could<00:03:42.099> turn<00:03:42.340> the<00:03:42.519> focus

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:42.699 
button where you could turn the focus

off but obviously they didn't so that is
a<00:03:45.129> bit<00:03:45.310> of<00:03:45.430> a<00:03:45.519> bummer<00:03:45.729> also<00:03:46.449> another<00:03:46.750> issue

00:03:47.009 --> 00:03:47.019 
a bit of a bummer also another issue

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:50.610 
a bit of a bummer also another issue
that<00:03:47.259> I<00:03:47.500> have<00:03:47.739> is<00:03:48.040> the<00:03:48.879> lead<00:03:49.199> now<00:03:50.199> I've<00:03:50.409> got

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:50.620 
that I have is the lead now I've got

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:52.439 
that I have is the lead now I've got
desktop<00:03:51.099> which<00:03:51.310> I<00:03:51.430> do<00:03:51.489> most<00:03:51.849> admired<00:03:52.180> it<00:03:52.329> in

00:03:52.439 --> 00:03:52.449 
desktop which I do most admired it in

00:03:52.449 --> 00:03:55.349 
desktop which I do most admired it in
with<00:03:52.659> if<00:03:52.959> I<00:03:53.680> didn't<00:03:54.009> have<00:03:54.220> my<00:03:54.459> extension<00:03:55.090> poor

00:03:55.349 --> 00:03:55.359 
with if I didn't have my extension poor

00:03:55.359 --> 00:03:58.199 
with if I didn't have my extension poor
on<00:03:55.569> my<00:03:56.109> desktop<00:03:56.530> this<00:03:57.129> would<00:03:57.430> be<00:03:57.639> a<00:03:57.669> complete

00:03:58.199 --> 00:03:58.209 
on my desktop this would be a complete

00:03:58.209 --> 00:03:59.580 
on my desktop this would be a complete
and<00:03:58.329> utter<00:03:58.449> nightmare<00:03:58.629> because<00:03:59.049> it<00:03:59.199> means<00:03:59.379> i

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590 
and utter nightmare because it means i

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:00.839 
and utter nightmare because it means i
would<00:03:59.709> have<00:03:59.829> to<00:03:59.889> stick<00:04:00.219> it<00:04:00.340> around<00:04:00.519> the<00:04:00.669> back

00:04:00.839 --> 00:04:00.849 
would have to stick it around the back

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:04.530 
would have to stick it around the back
and<00:04:01.169> that<00:04:02.169> is<00:04:02.290> just<00:04:02.530> not<00:04:02.650> practical<00:04:03.540> compared

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:04.540 
and that is just not practical compared

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:07.709 
and that is just not practical compared
to<00:04:04.750> the<00:04:04.870> kodak<00:04:05.229> playsport<00:04:05.409> and<00:04:06.599> actually<00:04:07.599> the

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:07.719 
to the kodak playsport and actually the

00:04:07.719 --> 00:04:10.409 
to the kodak playsport and actually the
CIA<00:04:08.049> and<00:04:08.469> the<00:04:08.500> lumix<00:04:08.979> which<00:04:09.759> give<00:04:10.030> you<00:04:10.150> leads

00:04:10.409 --> 00:04:10.419 
CIA and the lumix which give you leads

00:04:10.419 --> 00:04:14.189 
CIA and the lumix which give you leads
that<00:04:10.750> are<00:04:10.780> at<00:04:10.989> least<00:04:11.019> this<00:04:11.409> long<00:04:11.709> you<00:04:12.669> know<00:04:13.199> it

00:04:14.189 --> 00:04:14.199 
that are at least this long you know it

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:15.659 
that are at least this long you know it
is<00:04:14.349> a<00:04:14.379> bit<00:04:14.650> of<00:04:14.739> a<00:04:14.799> disappointment<00:04:15.099> and

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:15.669 
is a bit of a disappointment and

00:04:15.669 --> 00:04:18.120 
is a bit of a disappointment and
considering<00:04:16.630> that<00:04:16.750> you<00:04:16.989> pay<00:04:17.259> more<00:04:17.560> money<00:04:17.799> from

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:18.130 
considering that you pay more money from

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:20.039 
considering that you pay more money from
the<00:04:18.340> bloggie<00:04:18.969> than<00:04:19.269> you<00:04:19.389> do<00:04:19.570> for<00:04:19.780> the<00:04:19.840> place

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:20.049 
the bloggie than you do for the place

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:23.360 
the bloggie than you do for the place
ball<00:04:20.289> or<00:04:20.469> even<00:04:20.829> the<00:04:20.949> CIA<00:04:21.360> you<00:04:22.360> would<00:04:22.659> sort<00:04:23.199> of

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:23.370 
ball or even the CIA you would sort of

00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:26.159 
ball or even the CIA you would sort of
expect<00:04:24.370> them<00:04:24.610> to<00:04:24.849> put<00:04:25.090> a<00:04:25.120> little<00:04:25.449> bit<00:04:25.719> longer

00:04:26.159 --> 00:04:26.169 
expect them to put a little bit longer

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:28.350 
expect them to put a little bit longer
lead<00:04:26.680> in<00:04:27.310> your<00:04:27.820> accessory

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:28.360 
lead in your accessory

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:30.450 
lead in your accessory
so<00:04:28.930> that<00:04:29.199> was<00:04:29.379> a<00:04:29.409> little<00:04:29.590> bit<00:04:29.800> disappointing

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:30.460 
so that was a little bit disappointing

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:32.100 
so that was a little bit disappointing
also<00:04:31.210> the<00:04:31.360> fact<00:04:31.539> that<00:04:31.629> you<00:04:31.750> don't<00:04:31.900> have<00:04:32.080> a

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:32.110 
also the fact that you don't have a

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:34.800 
also the fact that you don't have a
power<00:04:32.409> on<00:04:32.439> button<00:04:32.789> which<00:04:33.789> I<00:04:34.180> had<00:04:34.539> an<00:04:34.659> issue

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:34.810 
power on button which I had an issue

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:36.839 
power on button which I had an issue
with<00:04:35.020> the<00:04:35.289> other<00:04:35.439> model<00:04:35.650> that<00:04:35.919> I<00:04:35.949> had<00:04:36.250> because

00:04:36.839 --> 00:04:36.849 
with the other model that I had because

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:38.279 
with the other model that I had because
basically<00:04:37.120> I<00:04:37.449> got<00:04:37.659> to<00:04:37.780> a<00:04:37.810> point<00:04:38.050> where<00:04:38.169> I

00:04:38.279 --> 00:04:38.289 
basically I got to a point where I

00:04:38.289 --> 00:04:40.230 
basically I got to a point where I
couldn't<00:04:38.500> even<00:04:38.650> turn<00:04:38.919> it<00:04:39.039> on<00:04:39.159> just<00:04:39.370> by<00:04:40.000> lifting

00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:40.240 
couldn't even turn it on just by lifting

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.719 
couldn't even turn it on just by lifting
that<00:04:40.569> flap<00:04:40.900> they<00:04:41.590> could<00:04:41.889> have<00:04:42.009> put<00:04:42.219> a<00:04:42.250> power<00:04:42.699> on

00:04:42.719 --> 00:04:42.729 
that flap they could have put a power on

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:44.339 
that flap they could have put a power on
button<00:04:42.939> there<00:04:43.509> which<00:04:43.840> would<00:04:44.050> have<00:04:44.139> made<00:04:44.289> a

00:04:44.339 --> 00:04:44.349 
button there which would have made a

00:04:44.349 --> 00:04:46.890 
button there which would have made a
huge<00:04:44.650> difference<00:04:44.919> because<00:04:45.430> it<00:04:46.150> would<00:04:46.719> mean

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:46.900 
huge difference because it would mean

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:48.209 
huge difference because it would mean
you<00:04:47.080> wouldn't<00:04:47.289> have<00:04:47.409> to<00:04:47.469> rely<00:04:47.830> on<00:04:47.860> this

00:04:48.209 --> 00:04:48.219 
you wouldn't have to rely on this

00:04:48.219 --> 00:04:50.159 
you wouldn't have to rely on this
mechanism<00:04:48.669> so<00:04:49.300> that<00:04:49.330> was<00:04:49.599> another<00:04:49.719> little

00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:50.169 
mechanism so that was another little

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:54.450 
mechanism so that was another little
niggle<00:04:50.500> and<00:04:50.939> lastly<00:04:51.939> no<00:04:52.840> wvga<00:04:53.620> like<00:04:54.099> i<00:04:54.219> said

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:54.460 
niggle and lastly no wvga like i said

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:56.339 
niggle and lastly no wvga like i said
previously<00:04:54.610> a<00:04:55.210> lot<00:04:55.509> of<00:04:55.569> the<00:04:55.629> videos<00:04:55.960> that<00:04:55.990> i<00:04:56.229> do

00:04:56.339 --> 00:04:56.349 
previously a lot of the videos that i do

00:04:56.349 --> 00:04:59.189 
previously a lot of the videos that i do
are<00:04:56.919> in<00:04:57.219> wvga<00:04:57.909> because<00:04:58.300> it's<00:04:58.449> easier<00:04:58.780> to<00:04:59.020> edit

00:04:59.189 --> 00:04:59.199 
are in wvga because it's easier to edit

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:02.550 
are in wvga because it's easier to edit
it's<00:04:59.710> nearly<00:05:00.099> as<00:05:00.340> good<00:05:00.490> as<00:05:00.639> HD<00:05:00.879> and<00:05:01.449> the<00:05:02.319> file

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:02.560 
it's nearly as good as HD and the file

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:05.760 
it's nearly as good as HD and the file
sizes<00:05:02.919> are<00:05:03.250> smaller<00:05:03.550> this<00:05:04.120> has<00:05:04.360> vga<00:05:04.770> obviously

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:05.770 
sizes are smaller this has vga obviously

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:08.100 
sizes are smaller this has vga obviously

00:05:14.249 --> 00:05:14.259 
all distorted so that was a little bit

00:05:14.259 --> 00:05:16.170 
all distorted so that was a little bit
disappointing<00:05:14.949> so<00:05:15.490> that's<00:05:15.729> the<00:05:15.819> buses<00:05:16.150> and

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:16.180 
disappointing so that's the buses and

comparison to the play sport i would say

00:05:20.349 --> 00:05:22.379 
comparison to the play sport i would say
that<00:05:20.560> the<00:05:20.620> play<00:05:20.830> sport<00:05:21.189> does<00:05:21.490> a<00:05:21.759> clearer

00:05:22.379 --> 00:05:22.389 
that the play sport does a clearer

side<00:05:29.830> of<00:05:29.979> things<00:05:30.129> if<00:05:30.520> I<00:05:30.789> had<00:05:30.819> to<00:05:31.000> choose

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:31.060 
side of things if I had to choose

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:33.300 
side of things if I had to choose
between<00:05:31.270> the<00:05:31.689> two<00:05:31.900> I<00:05:32.199> would<00:05:32.680> probably<00:05:32.860> still

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:33.310 
between the two I would probably still

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:35.490 
between the two I would probably still
go<00:05:33.550> with<00:05:33.759> the<00:05:33.849> correct<00:05:34.180> place<00:05:34.360> ball<00:05:34.629> because

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:35.500 
go with the correct place ball because

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:38.149 
go with the correct place ball because
you<00:05:36.039> know<00:05:36.190> I<00:05:36.490> think<00:05:36.729> it's<00:05:36.879> more<00:05:36.940> durable<00:05:37.629> and

00:05:38.149 --> 00:05:38.159 
you know I think it's more durable and

00:05:38.159 --> 00:05:40.920 
you know I think it's more durable and
the<00:05:39.159> picture<00:05:39.669> quality<00:05:39.849> like<00:05:40.270> I've<00:05:40.449> said<00:05:40.690> in

00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:40.930 
the picture quality like I've said in

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:44.279 
the picture quality like I've said in
the<00:05:41.440> 720p<00:05:42.069> is<00:05:42.490> better<00:05:42.879> than<00:05:43.509> the<00:05:43.779> sony<00:05:44.020> bloggie

00:05:44.279 --> 00:05:44.289 
the 720p is better than the sony bloggie

00:05:44.289 --> 00:05:47.700 
the 720p is better than the sony bloggie
if<00:05:44.949> they<00:05:45.639> sort<00:05:46.240> it<00:05:46.300> out<00:05:46.479> the<00:05:46.719> focus<00:05:47.319> on<00:05:47.469> this

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:47.710 
if they sort it out the focus on this

00:05:47.710 --> 00:05:50.550 
if they sort it out the focus on this
then<00:05:48.580> I<00:05:48.969> would<00:05:49.360> say<00:05:49.659> that<00:05:49.960> it<00:05:50.110> would<00:05:50.319> be<00:05:50.529> a

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:50.560 
then I would say that it would be a

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:52.920 
then I would say that it would be a
close<00:05:50.919> call<00:05:51.250> between<00:05:51.490> the<00:05:51.819> two<00:05:52.029> but<00:05:52.569> because

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:52.930 
close call between the two but because

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:55.290 
close call between the two but because
of<00:05:52.960> the<00:05:53.139> focus<00:05:53.589> in<00:05:53.770> on<00:05:53.979> this<00:05:54.819> and<00:05:55.060> the<00:05:55.150> fact

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:55.300 
of the focus in on this and the fact

00:05:55.300 --> 00:05:57.839 
of the focus in on this and the fact
that<00:05:55.419> it<00:05:55.629> goes<00:05:55.810> absolutely<00:05:56.050> a<00:05:56.469> wire<00:05:56.740> that<00:05:57.009> is

00:05:57.839 --> 00:05:57.849 
that it goes absolutely a wire that is

00:05:57.849 --> 00:06:00.269 
that it goes absolutely a wire that is
what<00:05:58.089> makes<00:05:58.330> the<00:05:58.689> the<00:05:59.020> kodak<00:05:59.409> playsport<00:05:59.589> a<00:06:00.099> lot

00:06:00.269 --> 00:06:00.279
