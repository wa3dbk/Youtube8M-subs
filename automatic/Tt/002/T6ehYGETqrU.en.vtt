00:00:01.459 --> 00:00:05.220
 is the family where the first values ​​of a human being are established but 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:08.320
 what better than francisco avilés family and couple therapist so that 

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:11.130
 tell us about this topic a few days francisco welcome as for the most 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.130
 feliz buenos aires - from the eleven meters 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.330
 many times this is constant so far how good it is necessary and 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:22.269
 listen to possible with a sculpture that are 

00:00:22.269 --> 00:00:26.419
 this section 22 for lobbyists to the production prices of 

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:30.599
 its plants go down from its star after the disinfection injury 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:32.570
 I'm not interested in talking about values 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:35.520
 in the human relationships of individual values ​​that is a subject in English 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.460
 despite the very important to be 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.130
 but not only values ​​in human relationships 

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:41.550
 now appears a 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:44.830
 one did not feel that it is the principle of reciprocity 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:48.290
 I think it's very important and that he takes into account that to build a 

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:49.330
 good relationship 

00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:51.770
 it is necessary to take in count 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.819
 some aspects like these that we are going to touch country 

00:00:54.819 --> 00:00:58.280
 this spot let's start with reciprocity 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:02.370
 we understand that there is a basic principle in human relations feet 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.840
 there is no doubt about the other 

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:07.610
 what you would not want them to do to you 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.610
 and that has to be the principle of reciprocity 

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:14.850
 if I want to maintain a good relationship with someone 

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.549
 I have to take care of it from that 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:18.520
 respect 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:19.640
 and to understand 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.080
 what loquillo united 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.280
 it's the same as I can wait 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.880
 in reciprocity I loved it then 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.940
 we do not have to be firm and tricks 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:31.600
 about the santos munárriz veracruz and residences of the question 

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.750
 12 years one of the main advisors of decent Spanish discord pib 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.060
 present in the pie industries 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:39.090
 I mean 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.179
 like so many while I'm not receiving orchestrating to conclude and 

00:01:43.179 --> 00:01:46.870
 We always look forward to those people and loans and I am one more 

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:51.420
 and when the municipalities that the new text was destroyed by satisfying the 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.300
 needs to turn a raw with a partner like next year 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:57.890
 who want me to believe that 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:02.310
 and it is precisely there that when the communication process was lacking, they are created 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:04.860
 expectations and then those are not met 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.069
 then one would expect to receive 

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:09.279
 i something in exchange for what they give 

00:02:09.279 --> 00:02:11.769
 and does not receive them but I believe that although inferior 

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:17.650
 qinghai and that I find important and retaliated in a statement this destroys 

00:02:18.279 --> 00:02:21.239
 more than wait for them to give us 

00:02:21.239 --> 00:02:25.170
 I think the emphasis we have to put what what we are capable of 

00:02:25.169 --> 00:02:26.449
 give to others 

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:30.239
 if we do not marry the unit frustrated waiting for God to fulfill the 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:34.400
 expectations that we have a catering we achieve the level of well-being and 

00:02:34.399 --> 00:02:38.699
 satisfaction I think the important thing is to focus on us and 

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:43.149
 imbalances that we bet on torture and imposes much less 

00:02:43.149 --> 00:02:46.160
 important points is that of communications we have been 

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:47.249
 working 

00:02:47.249 --> 00:02:50.829
 tactically that in all the interventions that I have here because 

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:53.060
 it's a subject that we'll have to be 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.490
 constantly going through communication as that process 

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:58.549
 with which I know you 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:02:59.989
 and you know me 

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:02.550
 I know your expectations and you know mine 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:06.720
 and if they are budgets and that the satisfaction of our needs 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.009
 more sure is that we will build a good relationship 

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:11.840
 the acceptance that appears now 

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:16.349
 We can not be at all times qualifying others 

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:21.790
 and be plying the 48 years on all the people that these are claimed 

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.779
 the people that we behave that means 

00:03:24.779 --> 00:03:26.509
 It's very important 

00:03:26.509 --> 00:03:27.979
 have that pressure 

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:30.979
 respect them and accept them in their individuality 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:36.189
 it is not possible for people to behave to be what we want them to be 

00:03:36.189 --> 00:03:40.749
 every person is different i am not like these we turn to criticism 

00:03:41.539 --> 00:03:43.459
 Sweden and outdoors 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:45.220
 in the situation of weakness 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:49.030
 I always remember expectations of change also to people do not do if they are 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:53.289
 Fit world had a boyfriend this I do not like these things but 

00:03:53.289 --> 00:03:56.179
 I have a hope to change the Kanak time 

00:03:56.179 --> 00:03:59.149
 there is not a ticket situation to those things are like that 

00:03:59.149 --> 00:04:03.599
 I think part of the television and the contribution that has not been a good 

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:05.609
 relationship with flexibility 

00:04:05.609 --> 00:04:09.449
 so many parents say for example is that I have a child that is and is very 

00:04:09.449 --> 00:04:14.309
 good very respectful very obedient very hard worker and I have another or others that do not 

00:04:14.309 --> 00:04:14.890
 are 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:16.319
 likewise then 

00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:20.669
 I believe that I say it here as others hand in hand all the attempts an important 

00:04:20.669 --> 00:04:22.060
 these have a function 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.620
 but even in the same way as the rest of the schools by 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:27.430
 example the indexes would be impossible 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:31.630
 the wealth in the award is useful precisely to be able to enjoy and 

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:35.470
 take advantage of diversity the differences that enriches us 

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:40.879
 it is important to appreciate the differences not only criticize the 1 stay with 

00:04:40.879 --> 00:04:44.879
 that but appreciate them respect the individuality and then 

00:04:46.059 --> 00:04:50.580
 establishes the foundations to build a good relationship not the one at a time 

00:04:50.579 --> 00:04:52.659
 last on the May plant 

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:55.710
 I had many advance emails 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:58.710
 to the difference here raised about being in love 

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.539
 ii one more day 

00:05:01.539 --> 00:05:04.539
 and precisely the painter the interest that is raising 

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:09.809
 that it would be timely for the next time would be the issue next time 

00:05:09.809 --> 00:05:14.449
 talk about a very important book that inscribes Robert Sterlin see the three in 

00:05:14.449 --> 00:05:15.439
 Tokyo 

00:05:15.439 --> 00:05:18.300
 what is it about the experience of love 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:21.130
 then he's going to pay me we're going to be able to practice 

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:24.370
 about issues different types of love relationships 

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:26.830
 and I think that if people 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:30.190
 you can consult the public you can consult we could not have 

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:31.960
 a very interesting program 

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:34.819
 people speak precisely about health 

00:05:34.819 --> 00:05:38.400
 as the pillars of love, by anticipating us a little, we experienced the 

00:05:38.399 --> 00:05:41.559
 Intimacy, passion and commitment 

00:05:41.559 --> 00:05:44.219
 in a relationship 

00:05:44.219 --> 00:05:47.219
 totally rewarding send your pillars 

00:05:47.759 --> 00:05:50.839
 Intimacy, passion and commitment and it's a real event 

00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:53.930
 they won by 4-1 

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:54.790
 very well 

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:56.559
 Buenos Aires Dec 11 

00:05:56.559 --> 00:05:58.749
 you have to stop also for 

00:05:58.749 --> 00:06:00.010
 annual percent 

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:03.570
 It is in these days of crisis and how they said 'the little apartment' with my first 

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:05.639
 go first to the values ​​that say nothing 

00:06:05.639 --> 00:06:06.849
 reciprocity 

00:06:06.849 --> 00:06:09.909
 When there is a crisis situation it is the first time that we finally leave 

00:06:09.909 --> 00:06:11.289
 always by tomás 

00:06:11.289 --> 00:06:13.940
 not always the city and structure 

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:16.599
 westwood the curator benito dumont 

00:06:16.599 --> 00:06:20.599
 and we also refuse to see what the other place can not see and always 

00:06:20.599 --> 00:06:24.569
 there is always a contribution from the world apart the referee but as phenomena 

00:06:25.189 --> 00:06:27.080
 maybe we do not move 

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:29.589
 how can we see those days 

00:06:29.589 --> 00:06:33.490
 precisely by the way that we can not see if we are close to what 

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:34.389
 near 

00:06:34.389 --> 00:06:36.689
 physically and emotionally 

00:06:36.689 --> 00:06:40.999
 - talks because when we talk about extreme acteck situations where 

00:06:40.999 --> 00:06:44.009
 the frustration the tension the anger any emotion 

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:49.070
 already the virus took as prey it is very difficult to establish the day when 

00:06:49.069 --> 00:06:53.389
 he is very angry as very sad or very desperate because he does not have time 

00:06:53.389 --> 00:06:57.629
 normally reaction reacted in inconvenient ways 

00:06:57.629 --> 00:06:59.770
 but data is that these documents did not warn 

00:06:59.770 --> 00:07:03.080
 fundamental because it is creating precisely the space 

00:07:04.129 --> 00:07:08.270
 I insist nelson piquet great spaces giving him his place and then 

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:11.419
 will be open to a dialogue where 

00:07:11.419 --> 00:07:13.900
 first of all I have to know what your needs are
