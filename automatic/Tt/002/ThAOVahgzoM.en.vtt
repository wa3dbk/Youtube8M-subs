00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:09.299
 well let's start 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:10.710
 Chapter 1 of the module 1 points and lines 

00:00:09.299 --> 00:00:12.750
 these are the basic movements that 

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:15.300
 let's do and I call them basic 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:17.400
 because they are the basis in reality of how 

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:19.860
 we are going to work from here in more with the 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.230
 airbrushing is so important to learn to 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:24.599
 do this work these exercises that 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:27.680
 I will give you what you will understand 

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:30.200
 tomorrow the outline that you are going to have 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:32.210
 to make a comparison is like the 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:35.360
 list that you currently have that 

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:37.820
 was marked when they started to learn 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.950
 to write then here we are going to do 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:42.890
 exactly the same thing we are going to learn to 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:45.470
 handling the airbrush is a job of 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.120
 double action and let's get acquainted 

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:49.250
 with the weight with the movement of 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.960
 airbrush so that the air to the game is 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.150
 part of our hand and our 

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.690
 body 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:58.770
 then without more let's start with 

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:58.770
 lines and points 

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:05.700
 let's start 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.700
 the handling of points 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:09.550
 I'm going to mark 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.479
 if possible debilitating 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.479
 with a link 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:26.330
 has been similar to one another 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:29.620
 I is what I'll do now step 

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.620
 to write blessed 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:36.119
 how do I make the points local points 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.759
 in this way I first press on the 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.259
 trigger down is very little the 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.270
 movement would have a little more 

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:45.030
 to the camera is very little movement 

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:47.070
 but you see it works like that then towards 

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:49.010
 down air begins to flow out 

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.930
 of air through 

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:54.530
 from the channel out 

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:57.830
 and backwards as a trigger is leaving 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:59.270
 leave the paint because the needle of the ine 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:02.750
 in 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:04.409
 it is pulled back and the flow of the 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:07.289
 exit 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:09.179
 I have been clear then down 

00:02:07.289 --> 00:02:12.270
 first and then back 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:14.880
 down and then back 

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:18.170
 down and then back 

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.170
 and then we start 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:24.260
 on board down and 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:26.810
 down 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.910
 down 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:29.870
 down comes the air and accept to 

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:32.980
 victims 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:36.730
 the air and reading 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:38.750
 again the air the paint 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:41.000
 and the air and then link it 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:44.740
 the air and then the painting 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.740
 the air and the decorative 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.750
 the air and then I lived it 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:53.000
 thus 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:54.890
 is that we are going to work and we are going to do 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:58.060
 what about Jesus what I need 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:03:00.740
 you practice much in the way 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:03.200
 cutting the air and returning to start at 

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:07.130
 every point I explain myself I need that 

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:10.430
 you pointed cut off to point 

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:12.620
 they cut they smell at the point of cutting not that 

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:14.740
 is constantly leaving the air yes 

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:14.740
 do not 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:31.810
 thank you more marked because they notice you 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:33.640
 he said raised his finger 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:37.510
 the trigger 

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:41.459
 and good makes the whole process more 

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:41.459
 then I will go 

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:46.410
 a little faster 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:58.160
 if you wake up the attention you will notice 

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:58.160
 this sounds like shot one and another 

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:02.870
 it's new 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:09.700
 that is, but I need you 

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:11.980
 practice this child a lot of points and 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.840
 be vertical horizontal from above to 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:16.299
 down and down up but that go 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:19.139
 doing it constantly to go 

00:04:16.299 --> 00:04:22.090
 loosening and getting used to it and now 

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:24.760
 then here as last it finished of 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:27.070
 show me I started with the most point 

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:29.280
 Quick 

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:31.950
 and I was doing it 

00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.780
 chemically what do I want that 

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:36.300
 you do when you achieve 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:39.450
 do it chemically and get the 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:41.910
 points pretty similar to each other there 

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:43.800
 they are already achieving on Sunday and they are 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:48.020
 achieving what we are looking for that is 

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:48.020
 master the red point by point
