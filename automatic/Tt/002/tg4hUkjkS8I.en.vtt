00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060 
looking for in these demos is usually a

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.520 
looking for in these demos is usually a
conceit<00:02:57.769> hold<00:02:58.769> on<00:02:58.889> what<00:02:59.099> just<00:02:59.280> happened<00:02:59.609> there

there<00:03:37.169> it<00:03:37.260> was<00:03:37.579> did<00:03:38.579> you<00:03:38.730> see<00:03:38.940> it<00:03:39.349> did<00:03:40.349> you<00:03:40.530> see

00:03:40.789 --> 00:03:40.799 
there it was did you see it did you see

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:41.289 
there it was did you see it did you see
it

00:03:41.289 --> 00:03:41.299 
it

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:43.550 
it
goodness<00:03:42.299> he<00:03:42.449> just<00:03:42.690> full<00:03:42.870> down<00:03:43.019> spray<00:03:43.290> in<00:03:43.409> that

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
goodness he just full down spray in that

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.300 
goodness he just full down spray in that
USB<00:03:44.250> there<00:03:44.430> isn't<00:03:44.639> he<00:03:45.500> deserve<00:03:46.500> that<00:03:46.709> death<00:03:46.949> I

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.310 
USB there isn't he deserve that death I

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.059 
USB there isn't he deserve that death I
guess<00:03:48.209> that<00:03:48.900> was<00:03:49.139> our<00:03:49.290> only<00:03:49.470> evidence<00:03:49.680> right

00:03:50.059 --> 00:03:50.069 
guess that was our only evidence right

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:52.969 
guess that was our only evidence right
there<00:03:50.280> we<00:03:50.459> will<00:03:50.699> go<00:03:50.909> and<00:03:51.150> review<00:03:51.629> it<00:03:51.769> once<00:03:52.769> the

00:03:52.969 --> 00:03:52.979 
there we will go and review it once the

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:55.099 
there we will go and review it once the
demo<00:03:53.190> is<00:03:53.459> over<00:03:53.790> his<00:03:54.180> crosshair<00:03:54.629> placement<00:03:55.019> is

00:03:55.099 --> 00:03:55.109 
demo is over his crosshair placement is

00:03:55.109 --> 00:03:56.270 
demo is over his crosshair placement is
absolutely<00:03:55.470> terrible<00:03:55.709> but<00:03:55.919> that<00:03:55.949> can<00:03:56.159> be

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
absolutely terrible but that can be

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:58.759 
absolutely terrible but that can be
explained<00:03:56.639> by<00:03:56.729> being<00:03:57.180> terrible<00:03:57.840> like<00:03:58.530> why<00:03:58.709> is

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:58.769 
explained by being terrible like why is

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:01.610 
explained by being terrible like why is

00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:02.560 
alright I guess that's all we get let's

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.950 
alright I guess that's all we get let's
review<00:05:02.980> the<00:05:03.190> evidence<00:05:03.700> what<00:05:04.480> we're<00:05:04.660> looking

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:04.960 
review the evidence what we're looking

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:06.960 
review the evidence what we're looking
for<00:05:04.990> here<00:05:05.410> is<00:05:05.590> consistent<00:05:06.130> suspicious

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:06.970 
for here is consistent suspicious

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:09.000 
for here is consistent suspicious
behavior<00:05:07.450> coupled<00:05:07.810> with<00:05:07.840> blatant<00:05:08.470> instances
