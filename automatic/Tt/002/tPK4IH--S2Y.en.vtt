00:00:01.719 --> 00:00:05.609
 in 1981, the Japanese Dutch scientists 

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:07.849
 invented a device that produced 

00:00:07.849 --> 00:00:09.160
 revolution in music 

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:11.120
 the industry they released a compact 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.190
 drive today these dodgy 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:14.750
 devices store a million bits 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:17.519
 information that's the whole story at home or in 

00:00:17.519 --> 00:00:20.519
 archives sit discs become irreplaceable 

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:24.039
 you need to produce compact discs 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:26.230
 sterile conditions any dust particles 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:29.199
 can ruin the whole process 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:30.949
 CDs are replicas made 

00:00:30.949 --> 00:00:33.860
 from the original glass reference 

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:35.930
 direct skr 

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.320
 now the real work begins 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:39.950
 thin plates of heat 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:41.630
 carries selected information in this 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:43.070
 case music 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.260
 written on it by writing 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.260
 laser beam 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.550
 after the information 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.780
 moved to disk causes two 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.450
 chemicals primer 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:04.450
 and photo resistive coated 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.400
 Deniska carefully removed from the apparatus 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.340
 then system coverage was filed 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.340
 dried ovens for 30 minutes 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.880
 Kuratov show or two pipe

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:35.200
 data manifestations 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.410
 imprinted on the glass now 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:40.410
 information is applied to the disk 

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:43.630
 the disc is placed in this apparatus for applying 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:46.720
 metallic coating next 

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:47.940
 stage is to apply 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:49.820
 metallic coating 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.590
 from nickel and vanadium 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.539
 after this electro forming 

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:56.179
 process appears in the salon from which 

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:59.200
 will make discs etched 

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:01.350
 expired immerse the chemical solution on 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:04.380
 7 10 minutes after that the reference appears 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.920
 roofs from which will make disks 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:09.440
 this cliche is then stamped giving it 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.080
 The desired form of the best material sent 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:15.080
 for recycling 

00:02:37.719 --> 00:02:39.339
 clichis occupy 

00:02:39.339 --> 00:02:41.199
 and the technique removes the film which 

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:44.209
 protects data applied to it 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:46.079
 after a visual inspection this is a cliche 

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:48.230
 send owned pressing maiden 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.359
 carefully set the shape 

00:02:50.359 --> 00:02:53.359
 for casting compact discs 

00:02:56.619 --> 00:02:58.619
 discs are made from 

00:02:58.619 --> 00:03:00.849
 special plastic called the box 

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:01.849

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:05.709
 liquid polycarbonate 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:07.679
 after patience it turns out 

00:03:07.679 --> 00:03:09.989
 small solid translucent disc 

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:12.219
 this disc is now ready to be applied to 

00:03:12.219 --> 00:03:14.599
 him a metallic coating to his 

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:16.840
 could read the reader 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.589
 devices 10 discs 

00:03:18.589 --> 00:03:20.779
 robot arm taking out low controversy and 

00:03:20.779 --> 00:03:23.779
 puts on a stand 

00:03:27.589 --> 00:03:29.229
 in the opening of the disc is very metal 

00:03:29.229 --> 00:03:31.589
 short simple process it consists of 

00:03:31.589 --> 00:03:33.389
 drawing on plastic 

00:03:33.389 --> 00:03:35.379
 desktops are very thin layer of 

00:03:35.379 --> 00:03:38.379
 aluminum 

00:03:44.149 --> 00:03:47.149
 fund 

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:53.119
 all this has been paid so far not applied 

00:03:53.119 --> 00:03:54.969
 aluminum coated 

00:03:54.969 --> 00:03:57.969
 vbd 

00:03:59.589 --> 00:04:02.019
 in the process almost completely 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:04.349
 automated which allows the plant to 

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:07.349
 word to say you're sitting on the bus 

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:16.099
 important defender of the surface of the disc 

00:04:16.099 --> 00:04:18.310
 therefore a glossy coat is applied 

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:20.750
 which allows also well 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:22.680
 attach a label to it and protect it 

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.680
 silks 

00:04:26.289 --> 00:04:27.729
 sculptors purple lamps 

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:30.729
 quickly dry glossy words 

00:04:34.319 --> 00:04:36.419
 and in this workshop stick protection 

00:04:36.419 --> 00:04:38.029
 label and silks 

00:04:38.029 --> 00:04:41.379
 7 10 discs can be decorated with them for 60 

00:04:41.379 --> 00:04:42.819
 seconds 

00:04:42.819 --> 00:04:45.050
 and after that the finished discs are sent to 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:46.569
 packing 

00:04:46.569 --> 00:04:47.860
 everything is very simple
