 They are the only oceans we have 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
 They have been evolving for billions of years 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
 They are essential for life on the planet 

00:00:19.201 --> 00:00:20.301
 So who is taking care of them? 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
 In the year 2000 a group of people went on a voyage of discovery 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
 To wonder what had been happening with the world's oceans 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.400
 What they discovered was more shocking than they had imagined 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
 We must decide the future of our oceans 

00:02:00.401 --> 00:02:06.001
