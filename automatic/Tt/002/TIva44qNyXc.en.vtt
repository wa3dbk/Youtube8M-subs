00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.550
 in calcium we have been told that it is the 

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.320
 glass once it is recycled and that it 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.760
 It becomes an ingredient to be able to 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:14.400
 make more glass because that's the way 

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:16.379
 throw one making glass glass 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.640
 until eternity eternally 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.269
 recyclable good 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.269
 we observe how 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:24.170
 in our daily life 

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.910
 and sometimes inadvertently break when 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:32.279
 we are 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:34.650
 we talk about glass or crystal seem 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.700
 the same but fernando really are 

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:37.410
 no, they are not 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:39.809
 look at this what we commonly call 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.830
 crystal and it really is as glass as 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.600
 any of these fields that 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:44.400
 we manufacture what happens is that in its 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.739
 chemical composition there is lead oxide 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:48.480
 that gives much more brightness and also we 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:50.760
 allows to detail what is decorative 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:52.080
 but they really are not crystal not 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.519
 We have a nature as look at you 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:55.070
 prepared here some samples for example 

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:58.769
 a quartz crystal or rock crystal 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:01:01.110
 this is a material as you see opaque that 

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:02.579
 is much more fragile and that nothing has to 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.159
 see in its structure with the glass that 

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:07.429
 we make 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:09.259
 and what is the recipe for glass is the 

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:10.899
 The most important raw material is 

00:01:09.259 --> 00:01:13.759
 recycled glass that we call calcined 

00:01:10.899 --> 00:01:16.600
 then we have the silica sand the 

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:19.999
 soul of all life sodium carbonate 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:23.119
 color element a calcium carbonate that 

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:25.099
 it's limestone without crushing all this 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:26.599
 what we do is mix it well and 

00:01:25.099 --> 00:01:29.899
 take it by conveyor belts 

00:01:26.599 --> 00:01:31.579
 we introduce them into 

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:34.069
 some informants that are some shovels that 

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:36.289
 they are introducing it into the oven 

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:37.280
 here we can see it go 

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:40.310
 producing a series of reactions 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:42.890
 chemicals around about 1500 degrees that 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:45.150
 produce a mass of glass that is at 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.040
 end out like a molten lava 

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.150
 and at the end of this oven we've already brought it 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.130
 directly on machines 

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:52.410
 conformation manufactured by the cars 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.290
 properly done then once 

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:56.330
 we have made the jar 

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:59.990
 there is a very important technical leap from 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:02.570
 I take 2300 degrees to about 800 in a few 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.070
 seconds that forces you to give him a 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.070
 heat treatment we introduce it 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:08.300
 inside a linear oven that is this 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.580
 we raise the temperature and go back to 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:13.340
 cool very slowly so that the car 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:14.660
 be mechanically stable we are now 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.090
 in the quality control area of ​​the 

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:19.730
 product here we perform and control 

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.350
 the restoration time we manufacture with 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.730
 jars that are good arrivals 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:24.470
 which are we for the zombie 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.360
 client opportunities those who 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.800
 we reject them we reintroduce 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:28.990
 in the oven to be part of the 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.630
 cars 

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:33.040
 we can stimulate it infinitely times 

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:36.450
 a whole kilo of video will get 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:36.450
 always another kilo of videos 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:42.770
 and glass has endless lives and that 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.660
 all the glass or the glasses and glasses 

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:47.210
 of glass that we call normally 

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:49.640
 we put glass is glass then the 

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:51.260
 cups and glasses you have to throw them too 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:56.260
 to the glass container for recycling 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:56.260
 Well no, no, they do not know why 

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.680
 in the glass container we should only 

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:03.560
 deposit glass containers bottles 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:05.810
 jars and jars never to other glasses 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.200
 like glasses and cups because they have rust 

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.170
 of lead 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.730
 neither cups and plates because those 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:13.810
 materials go to the garbage can 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:13.810
 normal house
