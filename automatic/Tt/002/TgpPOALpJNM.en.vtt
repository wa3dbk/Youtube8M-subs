to<00:01:27.869> make<00:01:28.020> an<00:01:28.140> X<00:01:28.380> through<00:01:28.770> the<00:01:28.860> circle<00:01:29.369> making

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
to make an X through the circle making

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.820 
to make an X through the circle making
the<00:01:30.450> next<00:01:30.720> to<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:30.900> circle<00:01:31.259> makes<00:01:31.439> it<00:01:31.560> a<00:01:31.650> little

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:31.830 
the next to the circle makes it a little

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:33.200 
the next to the circle makes it a little
bit<00:01:31.979> easier<00:01:32.310> to<00:01:32.340> actually<00:01:32.790> cut<00:01:33.000> out<00:01:33.150> the

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
bit easier to actually cut out the

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.270 
bit easier to actually cut out the
circle<00:01:33.750> you<00:01:34.200> want<00:01:34.320> to<00:01:34.439> periodically<00:01:34.950> clean

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
off the residue on the knife and make a

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:38.649 
off the residue on the knife and make a
little<00:01:37.140> bit<00:01:37.320> easier<00:01:37.350> for<00:01:37.830> the<00:01:37.950> whole<00:01:38.070> project

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:38.659 
little bit easier for the whole project

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:41.060 
little bit easier for the whole project
and<00:01:39.659> you'll<00:01:40.049> just<00:01:40.229> want<00:01:40.409> to<00:01:40.470> continue<00:01:40.890> on

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:41.070 
and you'll just want to continue on

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.539 
and you'll just want to continue on
through<00:01:41.369> each<00:01:41.970> section<00:01:42.479> of<00:01:42.600> the<00:01:42.659> head<00:01:42.930> and

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:43.549 
through each section of the head and

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:47.060 
through each section of the head and
cutting<00:01:44.549> out<00:01:44.670> each<00:01:44.850> quarter<00:01:45.240> piece<00:01:45.950> again<00:01:46.950> it

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
cutting out each quarter piece again it

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.380 
cutting out each quarter piece again it
makes<00:01:47.220> for<00:01:47.549> cutting<00:01:47.790> the<00:01:47.909> circle<00:01:48.090> a<00:01:48.329> little

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
makes for cutting the circle a little

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:49.789 
makes for cutting the circle a little
smoother

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:49.799 
smoother

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:52.429 
smoother
and<00:01:49.920> a<00:01:50.130> little<00:01:50.280> bit<00:01:50.460> easier<00:01:51.049> can<00:01:52.049> also<00:01:52.200> take

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:52.439 
and a little bit easier can also take

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:53.929 
and a little bit easier can also take
your<00:01:52.470> exacto<00:01:52.860> knife<00:01:53.130> and<00:01:53.310> run<00:01:53.490> it<00:01:53.610> around<00:01:53.729> the

00:01:53.929 --> 00:01:53.939 
your exacto knife and run it around the

00:01:53.939 --> 00:01:55.010 
your exacto knife and run it around the
edge<00:01:54.090> of<00:01:54.210> the<00:01:54.329> circle<00:01:54.509> that<00:01:54.750> you've<00:01:54.840> created

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:55.020 
edge of the circle that you've created

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.260 
edge of the circle that you've created
it'll<00:01:55.920> smooth<00:01:56.189> out<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.460> edges<00:01:56.610> a<00:01:56.790> little<00:01:57.119> bit

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
it'll smooth out the edges a little bit

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.179 
it'll smooth out the edges a little bit
which<00:01:57.509> isn't<00:01:57.840> completely<00:01:58.080> necessary<00:01:58.560> but

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
which isn't completely necessary but

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.460 
which isn't completely necessary but
it'll<00:01:59.790> be<00:01:59.939> good<00:02:00.540> for<00:02:00.600> dropping<00:02:01.080> the<00:02:01.110> speaker

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:01.470 
it'll be good for dropping the speaker

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:04.370 
it'll be good for dropping the speaker
in<00:02:02.210> so<00:02:03.210> you<00:02:03.299> want<00:02:03.450> to<00:02:03.539> go<00:02:03.659> ahead<00:02:03.750> and<00:02:04.049> test<00:02:04.259> the

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
in so you want to go ahead and test the

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.600 
in so you want to go ahead and test the
speaker<00:02:04.619> to<00:02:04.799> make<00:02:04.920> sure<00:02:05.070> it<00:02:05.159> fits<00:02:05.369> nice<00:02:05.579> and

snug next step you want to take your

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:11.900 
snug next step you want to take your
speaker<00:02:10.709> wire<00:02:10.860> and<00:02:11.069> you<00:02:11.160> want<00:02:11.310> to<00:02:11.400> cut<00:02:11.610> it<00:02:11.730> and

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
speaker wire and you want to cut it and

get your speaker pretty close to where
it<00:02:47.310> needs<00:02:47.459> to<00:02:47.549> be<00:02:47.730> and<00:02:48.450> then<00:02:49.049> next<00:02:49.260> you'll<00:02:49.500> take

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
it needs to be and then next you'll take

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.650 
it needs to be and then next you'll take
your<00:02:49.830> bag<00:02:50.190> of<00:02:50.370> polyfill<00:02:50.940> and<00:02:51.239> you<00:02:51.420> want<00:02:51.599> to

start stuffing the head you want to go

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:56.240 
start stuffing the head you want to go
ahead<00:02:54.480> and<00:02:54.750> stuff<00:02:54.989> it<00:02:55.140> pretty<00:02:55.320> full<00:02:55.620> the

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
ahead and stuff it pretty full the

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:57.740 
ahead and stuff it pretty full the
reason<00:02:56.640> we're<00:02:56.760> putting<00:02:57.000> the<00:02:57.090> polyfill<00:02:57.510> in<00:02:57.660> the

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
reason we're putting the polyfill in the

00:02:57.750 --> 00:02:59.840 
reason we're putting the polyfill in the
head<00:02:57.900> is<00:02:58.079> to<00:02:58.260> create<00:02:59.040> a<00:02:59.070> bigger<00:02:59.310> air<00:02:59.519> space

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
head is to create a bigger air space

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:01.729 
head is to create a bigger air space
than<00:03:00.060> is<00:03:00.180> actually<00:03:00.329> there<00:03:00.840> for<00:03:01.200> the<00:03:01.350> speaker

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
than is actually there for the speaker

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:02.960 
than is actually there for the speaker
and<00:03:01.920> it'll<00:03:02.220> help<00:03:02.370> with<00:03:02.459> the<00:03:02.640> speaker's

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:02.970 
and it'll help with the speaker's

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.509 
and it'll help with the speaker's
performance<00:03:03.739> next<00:03:04.739> step<00:03:04.980> you<00:03:05.100> want<00:03:05.250> to<00:03:05.340> take

00:03:05.509 --> 00:03:05.519 
performance next step you want to take

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:07.640 
performance next step you want to take
the<00:03:06.120> silicone<00:03:06.600> and<00:03:06.810> create<00:03:07.019> a<00:03:07.049> thin<00:03:07.350> bead

00:03:25.369 --> 00:03:25.379 
for the final step you want to take the

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:27.080 
for the final step you want to take the
screws<00:03:25.709> put<00:03:26.250> it<00:03:26.340> through<00:03:26.489> the<00:03:26.610> holes<00:03:26.819> and

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
screws put it through the holes and

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:28.759 
screws put it through the holes and
start<00:03:27.569> pushing<00:03:27.870> it<00:03:27.959> into<00:03:28.140> the<00:03:28.260> head<00:03:28.439> the

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769 
start pushing it into the head the

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:30.770 
start pushing it into the head the
plastic<00:03:29.370> should<00:03:29.549> be<00:03:29.640> pretty<00:03:29.849> easy<00:03:30.060> to<00:03:30.420> just

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:30.780 
plastic should be pretty easy to just

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.190 
plastic should be pretty easy to just
screw<00:03:31.409> down<00:03:31.620> by<00:03:31.829> hand<00:03:32.069> and<00:03:32.540> I<00:03:33.540> just<00:03:33.689> went<00:03:34.140> down

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
screw down by hand and I just went down

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.059 
screw down by hand and I just went down
halfway<00:03:34.590> on<00:03:35.430> all<00:03:36.000> four<00:03:36.269> first<00:03:36.659> and<00:03:36.989> then<00:03:37.709> the

00:03:38.059 --> 00:03:38.069 
halfway on all four first and then the

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:41.000 
halfway on all four first and then the
final<00:03:38.400> step<00:03:38.640> I<00:03:38.790> went<00:03:38.970> around<00:03:39.209> and<00:03:39.890> put<00:03:40.890> them

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
final step I went around and put them

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.089 
final step I went around and put them
all<00:03:41.159> nice<00:03:41.340> and<00:03:41.549> snug<00:03:41.819> this<00:03:42.799> avoids<00:03:43.799> it<00:03:43.950> from

00:03:44.089 --> 00:03:44.099 
all nice and snug this avoids it from

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:46.890 
all nice and snug this avoids it from
being<00:03:44.280> too<00:03:44.519> tight<00:03:44.760> on<00:03:44.909> one<00:03:45.090> side<00:03:45.299> or<00:03:45.480> the<00:03:45.569> other
