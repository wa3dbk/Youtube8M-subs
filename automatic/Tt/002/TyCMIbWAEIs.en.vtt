fructose<00:00:24.480> corn<00:00:24.720> syrup<00:00:25.019> in<00:00:25.470> the<00:00:25.949> grocery<00:00:26.400> store

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
fructose corn syrup in the grocery store

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:29.870 
fructose corn syrup in the grocery store
and<00:00:26.880> in<00:00:27.420> your<00:00:27.599> cupboards<00:00:28.019> now<00:00:28.710> one<00:00:29.340> question<00:00:29.580> I

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
and in your cupboards now one question I

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.510 
and in your cupboards now one question I
always<00:00:30.060> get<00:00:30.510> is<00:00:30.779> why<00:00:31.260> do<00:00:31.320> manufacturers<00:00:32.279> put

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
always get is why do manufacturers put

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.670 
always get is why do manufacturers put
high<00:00:32.790> fructose<00:00:33.090> corn<00:00:33.329> syrup<00:00:33.660> in<00:00:34.140> my<00:00:34.380> food

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
high fructose corn syrup in my food

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.250 
high fructose corn syrup in my food
instead<00:00:35.280> of<00:00:35.399> sugar<00:00:35.730> it's<00:00:36.329> much<00:00:36.809> much<00:00:37.200> cheaper

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
instead of sugar it's much much cheaper

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:40.130 
instead of sugar it's much much cheaper
for<00:00:38.070> them<00:00:38.160> to<00:00:38.489> use<00:00:38.700> this<00:00:39.000> chemical<00:00:39.570> high

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:40.140 
for them to use this chemical high

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.290 
for them to use this chemical high
fructose<00:00:40.410> corn<00:00:40.620> syrup<00:00:40.920> than<00:00:41.579> natural<00:00:42.030> sugar

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
fructose corn syrup than natural sugar

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.049 
fructose corn syrup than natural sugar
so<00:00:42.899> actually<00:00:43.500> their<00:00:43.950> food<00:00:44.309> items<00:00:44.700> will<00:00:44.910> be<00:00:44.940> a

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059 
so actually their food items will be a

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:46.700 
so actually their food items will be a
little<00:00:45.360> bit<00:00:45.480> cheaper<00:00:45.690> but<00:00:46.230> you're<00:00:46.410> the<00:00:46.559> one

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710 
little bit cheaper but you're the one

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.400 
little bit cheaper but you're the one
that<00:00:46.890> suffers<00:00:47.100> so<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.539> number<00:00:48.930> one<00:00:49.140> place

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
that suffers so the number one place

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:50.750 
that suffers so the number one place
most<00:00:49.770> people<00:00:50.100> are<00:00:50.190> getting<00:00:50.460> their<00:00:50.610> high

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
most people are getting their high

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.290 
most people are getting their high
fructose<00:00:51.030> corn<00:00:51.239> syrup<00:00:51.570> is<00:00:51.960> in<00:00:52.649> soda<00:00:53.280> now<00:00:53.940> the

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:54.300 
fructose corn syrup is in soda now the

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:56.979 
fructose corn syrup is in soda now the
ingredients<00:00:54.780> list<00:00:55.350> on<00:00:55.559> this<00:00:55.829> coke<00:00:56.250> is

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:56.989 
ingredients list on this coke is

00:00:56.989 --> 00:00:59.840 
ingredients list on this coke is
carbonated<00:00:57.989> water<00:00:58.199> high<00:00:59.100> fructose<00:00:59.430> corn

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
carbonated water high fructose corn

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.119 
carbonated water high fructose corn
syrup<00:00:59.969> so<00:01:00.600> the<00:01:00.780> second<00:01:01.289> ingredient<00:01:01.500> in<00:01:02.100> here

00:01:02.119 --> 00:01:02.129 
syrup so the second ingredient in here

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:04.700 
syrup so the second ingredient in here
is<00:01:02.550> high<00:01:02.879> fructose<00:01:03.270> corn<00:01:03.480> syrup<00:01:03.840> and<00:01:04.260> there

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
is high fructose corn syrup and there

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.670 
is high fructose corn syrup and there
are<00:01:04.830> 40<00:01:05.339> grams<00:01:05.729> of<00:01:06.060> sugar<00:01:06.360> in<00:01:06.630> this<00:01:06.930> one<00:01:07.200> can<00:01:07.530> of

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
are 40 grams of sugar in this one can of

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.920 
are 40 grams of sugar in this one can of
coke<00:01:07.950> which<00:01:08.460> is<00:01:08.640> the<00:01:08.790> equivalent<00:01:09.390> of<00:01:09.510> 10

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
coke which is the equivalent of 10

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:12.560 
coke which is the equivalent of 10
teaspoons<00:01:10.530> of<00:01:10.680> sugar<00:01:10.740> so<00:01:11.580> imagine<00:01:12.030> putting<00:01:12.180> 10

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
teaspoons of sugar so imagine putting 10

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.020 
teaspoons of sugar so imagine putting 10
teaspoons<00:01:13.110> of<00:01:13.229> sugar<00:01:13.290> in<00:01:13.740> a<00:01:13.920> cup<00:01:14.159> adding<00:01:14.820> some

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
teaspoons of sugar in a cup adding some

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.149 
teaspoons of sugar in a cup adding some
water<00:01:15.180> and<00:01:15.540> then<00:01:15.900> drinking<00:01:16.380> that<00:01:16.530> or<00:01:16.860> even

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
water and then drinking that or even

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.950 
water and then drinking that or even
worse<00:01:17.400> giving<00:01:18.030> that<00:01:18.180> to<00:01:18.330> your<00:01:18.479> kids

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
worse giving that to your kids

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.249 
worse giving that to your kids

drinking Gatorade
well<00:01:23.700> there's<00:01:23.939> high<00:01:24.180> fructose<00:01:24.600> corn<00:01:24.810> syrup<00:01:25.140> in

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
well there's high fructose corn syrup in

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.670 
well there's high fructose corn syrup in
Gatorade<00:01:26.549> it<00:01:27.060> also<00:01:27.270> happens<00:01:27.810> to<00:01:27.900> be<00:01:28.140> blue<00:01:28.380> and

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680
