00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:16.650
 today she drinks and in this match 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.550
 just really crazy cars in gta 5 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.619
 show if not even the 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.029
 craziest cars seen as in gta 5 

00:00:19.619 --> 00:00:22.259
 gg made right on the ball 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.880
 force reported cars 

00:00:22.259 --> 00:00:26.310
 all pictures i give you in this video 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.810
 Screens are from the side of tk that 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.100
 Such an institution in any case like 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.449
 said really crazy cars 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.340
 make both the paint as 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.510
 also do the complete body shape 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.769
 it's really changing 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.330
 pretty blatant for cars 

00:00:34.769 --> 00:00:37.590
 that we will be the same in any case 

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:37.949
 to see is to stay tuned and to everyone 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.330
 case 

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:40.860
 Before that wanted to ask if we 

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.580
 maybe a blatant easy too 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.500
 can crack 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:44.610
 I know you are really always bucket 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:46.350
 active and he always does 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:47.519
 to lead a blatant and such and me 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:49.229
 I will be really happy in any case 

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:50.909
 when we really get up at this meeting 

00:00:49.229 --> 00:00:52.350
 an absolutely sick to go easy target 

00:00:50.909 --> 00:00:53.820
 would if you sit in a table 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.629
 then hold on to the table now 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.449
 is she really sick? 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.449
 So let's make the three people 

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:04.229
 36 on this video will definitely be 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.909
 extremely pleased but already we say 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.130
 strong ecm sometimes hides with the first 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.990
 Reported car and we start with 

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.189
 the marshall monstertruck this car 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.210
 is actually not that blatant 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:14.370
 it changes in any case 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.780
 get straight to you but you can 

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:17.280
 just see it is no second 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.840
 but it is a four-door and me 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.400
 He definitely liked this car 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.870
 pretty funny because it's easy 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.610
 monster truck is pretty long 

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:25.620
 then we come to the 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.260
 next car and indeed to the samples 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:29.460
 But trend without a roof and this 

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:31.290
 car if I'm not even like that 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.670
 turned off so you realize I've got myself 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:34.320
 so slowly increase the will be on everyone 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.880
 even worse cars come this case 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.990
 car finally finds itself so turned off and 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.610
 I even like this car pretty much 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.020
 cool if this would really exist 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:41.580
 be because then promptly separates as 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.500
 Convertible fans are running pretty cool 

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:44.940
 with me personally this this carbon 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.220
 roof at the branch trend not so 

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:48.720
 like and if it then just as jain 

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.980
 as convertible would give if this on 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.420
 rockstar is cool 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:53.070
 games definitely take your time 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.020
 For example, on this basis a car me 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.479
 Fans definitely cool 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.190
 then it goes on with the stirling gt 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.960
 and now look at this turning goes 

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:03.510
 it is not completely normal it is the 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.010
 sterling as stretch limo and that 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:06.330
 car I really really early 

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:08.640
 made because it is just such a classic car 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:10.229
 But it is also in such a stretch 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.400
 turned limo is really pretty funny 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.129
 And you can definitely do that 

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:16.260
 then take his complete meeting 

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:17.730
 it continues with the panther and her 

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:19.170
 you can also see directly with 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:21.330
 Canto is not right the speakers are 

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:22.650
 bigger than the car itself I found that 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:24.209
 car in any case pretty funny because 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.400
 it is simply much higher than it is long 

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:28.799
 and simple evil fat mature on 

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:30.150
 the smallest car in the game is found 

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:32.310
 I'm really pretty, personally 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:33.750
 funny then it continues with the 

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.799
 we also wave it out of the story 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:37.980
 To know the mode with which one, for example 

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:40.319
 always the grass has picked up with franklin 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.150
 to supply his shop but this 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:43.739
 if it is not quite normal 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:45.030
 is namely a biplane and so can 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:46.530
 In any case, the double 

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.360
 lots of graf with smuggling 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:50.160
 Then let's have a look at the mini 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:52.019
 look like smoke from the server mode 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:53.340
 know of the daughter of Michael and 

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:55.019
 You can also go here again directly 

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:56.760
 recognize something with this mini 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:59.280
 it's not just a stretch limo 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.840
 All in all, there are only two doors 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.579
 in the huge doors was probably not like that 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.410
 but pay close attention if you want to 

00:03:02.579 --> 00:03:06.329
 he is careful to pay attention 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.190
 seats and can definitely be 

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:10.230
 but one or the other friend still 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:12.390
 take away people then it is still possible 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:13.950
 continue with those probably two sick cars 

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:15.450
 I found and I would 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:18.599
 say we're looking right here now 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:19.920
 times this yes this author of this car 

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:21.540
 looks really pretty sick i 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:23.099
 do you think your worth recognizing or 

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:24.630
 At least most of you event is 

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:26.489
 know from a movie and that from the 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:28.650
 film back to the future it is that 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:29.880
 Car from back to the future looks up 

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:31.169
 any case really cool with out 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.310
 all this with all this 

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:34.260
 cabling and so they just there 

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:35.639
 were attached by the textures the 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.859
 there were still changes looks on everyone 

00:03:35.639 --> 00:03:38.880
 case f pretty cool out and 

00:03:37.859 --> 00:03:41.910
 Now we come to my absolute 

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:43.380
 favorites for this batman 

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:44.910
 mobile or whatever you want to call it 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.500
 is it really damned crass what 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:48.630
 I changed everything in this car 

00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:50.400
 suppose that in this car as 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:51.450
 starting form next to the mesh monster 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:53.340
 truck or just this other one 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:54.780
 independence day monster truck taken 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:56.639
 I forgot the name 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:59.130
 Write me in the comments how 

00:03:56.639 --> 00:04:01.829
 This American monster truck 

00:03:59.130 --> 00:04:03.359
 trial and this car was like 

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:05.280
 said a lot has changed 

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:06.629
 there the rims and the paint 

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:08.069
 but that's really just that 

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:09.660
 slightest because you have there's wings 

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:11.700
 you can put these fat behind 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:13.319
 see nozzles serving there to the other 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:14.609
 and it looks really blatantly 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:16.769
 this car and that were so 

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:18.329
 probably the sick cars it 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:20.039
 ever seen in Germany 

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:21.750
 this is a really all those cars 

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:23.450
 So also in gta 5 drove around so 

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:25.040
 not just photoshop now 

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:26.450
 because everything is really suspected 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:28.760
 cars so what can we do there 

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:30.080
 and then just got another one 

00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:31.580
 Paint on it looks set 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:32.960
 in any case really pretty cool out of me 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:34.520
 So what always really fascinates what is there 

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.930
 everything can be done you can me 

00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.460
 like to write in the comments 

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:39.080
 you think about it which car 

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:40.970
 you found most starkly my absolute 

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:43.280
 favorit is like saying that the this 

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:44.930
 batman monstertruck and yes then how 

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:46.220

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:47.180
