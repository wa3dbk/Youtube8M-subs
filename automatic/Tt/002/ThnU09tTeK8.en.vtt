00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:05.800
 let's move on to part of lucas 

00:00:03.219 --> 00:00:08.380
 matthysse to the forecasts with the 

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:11.349
 tremendous fight together with what I expected 

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:13.780
 there in new york when they mark us 

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:17.050
 well, lucas matthysse with more resources 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:18.550
 that without running simply by putting a 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:21.010
 little distance between him and his rival 

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:22.810
 with more boxing resources like the 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:24.850
 good punch dominated the first part of the 

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:28.270
 combat made it look easy then 

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:30.940
 celebrating the horse a very fight 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:35.370
 smart and even in favor of his 

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:35.370
 castle in the first half 

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:50.520
 can not keep a little more and then 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:50.520
 initiative 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:01.840
 I liked more the first card 114 a 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:05.880
 good score I'm going more for the 

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.880
 tie on the card 

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:10.930
 we are not judges to be able to give 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:14.049
 score in a fight but I already had it 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:16.600
 sat 14 14 because because more lucas says 

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:18.759
 he let win that the second half of the 

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.979
 fight if I compatible with a 

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:23.560
 honest performance honestly in 

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:25.560
 the first six seven episodes with 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:27.369
 combinations including long swan 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.470
 left-right especially in 

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:31.960
 dramatic to what did not throw nuances 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:34.600
 in impacted in the face of purposes 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.610
 you can not fight at these levels with 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.830
 the face in front more or less the same 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:41.649
 curious problem juniors skipped this 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:43.509
 Saturday in cause but there were no waists 

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:45.820
 had not established and sooner or later 

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:48.250
 Well, it ended with this cut that is worth 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:50.200
 shame to say it was headbutting a header and 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.149
 cut to stay in the Tourism Ministry to 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.590
 the fight did not let him see the blood that 

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:55.659
 although still in the corner that they were 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:57.280
 defining and they were working very 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:59.500
 well as far as the bleeding is not what 

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.270
 they stopped to see then that's a 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.610
 reason also in which he did not leave 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.619
 exploit their combinations of blows of 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.630
 single lead did not let pressure 

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:09.250
 because because the activated blood or you 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.110
 it locked the eye and then then it came to 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.910
 remove him with the glove but at the end of 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:14.730
 accounts what a cloth is 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:16.660
 and smart a good new 

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.750
 used to fighting like that but 

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:22.900
 Now Luis Oyola will be provided by the party 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:24.160
 he received powerful economic blows in 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.170
 the positions fragile legs before in 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.510
 some styles I think that there was 

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:30.430
 where Batista did not take the same 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:32.410
 confidence in continuing to flip the 

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.600
 same way the second episode can 

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:36.130
 ask mission for booty with a 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.380
 right and a left perks of 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:41.230
 this guy has a superhuman punch 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:43.660
 bestial and the only thing to buy 

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:45.640
 with me is that he has his arms very 

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:47.650
 shorts was very short of where I was 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:49.810
 it's never easy for them to have to fly 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:52.300
 the hooks were no longer hooks were 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.220
 flown left and in this sense 

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:57.010
 he could not repeat the story 

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:59.680
 then worry more pro Monica 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.840
 stop lukas nuances that by offending the 

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:03.760
 Argentine and that's where lucas matthysse 

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.190
 first winning and fighting here are 

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.530
 the numbers much more effective a lot 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.750
 more boxing and ended hopes of 

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:12.700
 face to a forecast at the end of 

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:14.620
 accounts by hand and I think the victory 

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:17.170
 is just for lucas nuances had a 

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.270
 better performance did a great job 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:21.819
 halfway through the fight he declared this 

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:23.380
 try to fight the 12 rounds was 

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:25.150
 close to even going to the canvas what is 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:27.099
 easy as Juan Manuel pointed 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:29.260
 marquez but I really liked what he did 

00:03:27.099 --> 00:03:32.349
 the Argentine is a different facet 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:34.959
 before danny garcÃ­a we saw him go only 

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:35.770
 towards the front he shit boxing for ale 

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:37.720
 Garcia 

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:40.120
 now he teaches us a different boxing he 

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:42.040
 see that he has resources and the plan to the 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.540
 perfectly good plan led him out 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.450
 I think what you have to do not 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:48.160
 I would look for the short economic zone 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:50.500
 because we know that the only thing has a 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.630
 stuck for pea then and they are a 

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:54.130
 very important fight in some machines 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:56.440
 they are preparing us to be moving 

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:58.630
 but in some times he stopped lukas 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:04:00.010
 matrices was connected and connected very 

00:03:58.630 --> 00:04:01.870
 strong in which as I say it 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:05.200
 they put in faltering lands and where 

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:07.209
 it gave him to think where I do not know he did not have 

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.709
 to have stopped to have stopped 

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:11.110
 exchange blows because I was going to 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:12.640
 finish what it is that the second 

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:14.890
 half the fight of opportunity 

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:17.500
 chronic because lucas matthysse felt 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:19.130
 the power and even moved and when 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:21.860
 he received clean blows pity 

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:24.380
 yes yes yes yes no simple buseros back is 

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:25.670
 very very tired and especially when one 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:27.590
 has the nature of going towards the 

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:29.600
 front as the case of hue then 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:31.610
 skip the preparation is different and 

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:33.410
 so so its different the way 

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:35.990
 facing your opponent is different and 

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:38.600
 just that tired nuance in the second 

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:40.010
 part of the combat we go to the subject 

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:41.330
 but now new york 

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:43.310
 let's listen to the words of lucas 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:45.770
 matthysse who valentona bobby te 

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:48.760
 I want to my web or apathy or to that 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:48.760
 listen out 

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:59.159
 but before talking about the loss I 

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:00.689
 I stay with the forecast digest with 

00:04:59.159 --> 00:05:04.939
 about the last round that hug 

00:05:00.689 --> 00:05:04.939
 it was worth somehow what it was 

00:05:13.999 --> 00:05:22.969
 the people two things 

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:41.610
 and I believe that the campaign until the last 

00:05:37.830 --> 00:05:43.800
 I was moving and pulling and blocking 

00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:46.300
 the puncher feels in his body when 

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:53.500
 put your hand to the bottom 

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:57.550
 I think I almost could not move 

00:05:53.500 --> 00:06:01.300
 hands in some threads up down 

00:05:57.550 --> 00:06:03.610
 but still at the time that if they felt a 

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:07.380
 hand but but always aware of what 

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:07.380
 what was he doing and now with whom
