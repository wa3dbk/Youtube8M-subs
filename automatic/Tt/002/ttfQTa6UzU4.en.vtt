00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.629 
who's in the back he reads a story with
Abraham<00:03:13.169> Brooks<00:03:13.379> so<00:03:13.620> that<00:03:13.799> is<00:03:13.980> actually<00:03:14.489> his

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:14.639 
Abraham Brooks so that is actually his

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:16.729 
Abraham Brooks so that is actually his
routine<00:03:15.000> and<00:03:15.299> he<00:03:15.389> goes<00:03:15.540> to<00:03:15.569> bed<00:03:15.689> right<00:03:16.079> at<00:03:16.319> 7:00
