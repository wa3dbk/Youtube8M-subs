slider I like the glossy one it's nice

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:27.590 
slider I like the glossy one it's nice
it<00:01:25.200> just<00:01:25.229> like<00:01:25.710> goes<00:01:26.340> over<00:01:26.670> anything<00:01:26.970> comes<00:01:27.450> in

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
it just like goes over anything comes in

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.120 
it just like goes over anything comes in
and<00:01:27.750> out<00:01:27.810> of<00:01:27.930> your<00:01:27.990> pocket<00:01:28.350> really<00:01:28.500> easily<00:01:28.890> and

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
and out of your pocket really easily and

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.749 
and out of your pocket really easily and
if<00:01:30.000> you're<00:01:30.119> wondering<00:01:30.799> this<00:01:31.799> is<00:01:31.860> definitely

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
if you're wondering this is definitely

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:36.649 
if you're wondering this is definitely
the<00:01:33.659> best<00:01:33.869> case<00:01:34.220> and<00:01:35.220> I<00:01:36.090> think<00:01:36.119> you<00:01:36.420> should<00:01:36.570> get

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
the best case and I think you should get

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:38.660 
the best case and I think you should get
it<00:01:36.840> it's<00:01:37.049> just<00:01:37.290> as<00:01:37.500> slippery<00:01:37.979> as<00:01:38.009> the<00:01:38.280> iphone

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
it it's just as slippery as the iphone

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.580 
it it's just as slippery as the iphone
so<00:01:38.909> if<00:01:39.119> you<00:01:39.210> take<00:01:39.390> your<00:01:39.600> regular<00:01:39.930> iphone<00:01:40.140> and

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
so if you take your regular iphone and

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.950 
so if you take your regular iphone and
you<00:01:40.650> don't<00:01:40.829> have<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.130> incase<00:01:41.400> slider<00:01:41.780> you<00:01:42.780> can

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
you don't have the incase slider you can

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.469 
you don't have the incase slider you can
just<00:01:43.140> put<00:01:43.439> it<00:01:43.590> on<00:01:43.770> to<00:01:44.399> something<00:01:44.970> that<00:01:45.270> would

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
just put it on to something that would

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.300 
just put it on to something that would
stick<00:01:45.780> like<00:01:46.020> put<00:01:46.530> it<00:01:46.560> in<00:01:46.740> and<00:01:46.890> out<00:01:46.950> of<00:01:47.130> your

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
stick like put it in and out of your

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.370 
stick like put it in and out of your
pocket<00:01:47.909> your<00:01:48.119> jeans<00:01:48.360> pocket<00:01:48.450> and<00:01:48.990> go<00:01:49.200> like

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
pocket your jeans pocket and go like

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.450 
pocket your jeans pocket and go like
this<00:01:50.299> it's<00:01:51.299> slippery<00:01:51.659> it<00:01:52.500> it's<00:01:53.220> definitely

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
this it's slippery it it's definitely

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:55.940 
this it's slippery it it's definitely
easy<00:01:53.880> and<00:01:54.240> if<00:01:54.899> you<00:01:54.990> have<00:01:55.110> a<00:01:55.140> rubber<00:01:55.409> one<00:01:55.680> it

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
easy and if you have a rubber one it

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.940 
easy and if you have a rubber one it
sticks<00:01:56.490> which<00:01:57.000> I<00:01:57.119> don't<00:01:57.180> like<00:01:57.299> so<00:01:58.079> this<00:01:58.500> one<00:01:58.710> is

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
sticks which I don't like so this one is

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.530 
sticks which I don't like so this one is
exactly<00:01:59.219> like<00:01:59.399> the<00:01:59.670> iphone<00:02:00.060> is<00:02:00.090> just<00:02:00.450> a

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:00.540 
exactly like the iphone is just a

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:05.209 
exactly like the iphone is just a
slippery<00:02:01.700> so<00:02:02.780> so<00:02:03.780> yeah<00:02:04.170> that's<00:02:04.740> think<00:02:05.070> a

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
slippery so so yeah that's think a

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:08.719 
slippery so so yeah that's think a
slider<00:02:05.520> and<00:02:05.820> it's<00:02:07.069> definitely<00:02:08.069> the<00:02:08.310> best<00:02:08.459> case

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
slider and it's definitely the best case

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.800 
slider and it's definitely the best case
