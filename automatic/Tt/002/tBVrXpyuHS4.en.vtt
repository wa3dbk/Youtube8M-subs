00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.440
 hello friends with you I am ella myself 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:04.770
 welcome to mode called 

00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:08.099
 pamplona 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:10.800
 so friends here we are and the essence 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:13.559
 this mode is that here and now 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.410
 our eggs in inventory to our dynamite and 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.539
 we will have to fire their neighbor 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:22.230
 islands oh my god oh my god how am i 

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:24.510
 little hp how do i have little hp and and and not 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.580
 wanna die i don't wanna die in her 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.590
 dangerous dangerously dangerous 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:32.460
 as much as possible mansity of these dynamites 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:35.010
 so ok now somewhere yes here are yours 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.930
 and 4 not to throw but in principle, these 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.450
 here is the last one I think I think 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:42.149
 so over there head over to throw 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.160
 oh oh oh missed along the way so now 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:47.489
 just under the drop of dynamite and it will be possible 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:50.250
 somehow go and try to put out 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:53.850
 I bought them a class of some kind there for two 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:56.489
 Thousands of genes 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:00.120
 there is a dude, everything is in the area should 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:04.439
 die already and there he is dude 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:09.030
 I got it, I got it purely in it 

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:11.640
 here it is dangerously dangerous so dangerous 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:14.010
 now i don't know where i'm going 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.860
 I think here the dude costs on pretty 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:20.189
 normal place is very difficult here 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:24.119
 get there no people get you like that 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:29.070
 look there are two dudes left and they 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:33.360
 will flow into it okay so i will throw 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:36.119
 pagodas are our dynamite and this is the hive and her and 

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:36.689
 itâ€™s dangerous to swap against shock 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:40.549
 going away 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:47.670
 that's great now get away straight in the face 

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:50.939
 so those are there damn when someone from 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:54.890
 I have so zadolbalsya okay die in 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:57.740
 her and so there you can throw 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:02:00.270
 reads it should be raised 

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.880
 okay here and so I think it will be normal 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.700
 yes but in principle yes but he has already come running 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:09.679
 there was one person so he is right in me 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:12.150
 aiming since anything like this here Kinema 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:14.489
 so here we throw 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:18.920
 let's go aim at me why not me 

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:24.140
 why not in this dude so now we 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:28.349
 Look, he does not hold out is a plus 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:31.739
 big plus now we will throw pagodas 

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:34.920
 and stupidly there he does not have enough output 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:39.450
 how to jump into the water so now like this 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:44.280
 here is a man let's principle i into him 

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:47.370
 got all easy win and so now will be 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:50.099
 one more game and so here's another 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:53.250
 playing now now now when we 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:55.139
 there will be a dynamite and i will think the mash 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:56.370
 more cards already appeared more 

00:02:55.139 --> 00:02:58.470
 most obstacles 

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:02.489
 and in principle we need to go somewhere 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:04.260
 for trying where we will be very there 

00:03:02.489 --> 00:03:06.810
 get there i can't break these blocks off 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:09.000
 I got lost dynamite punished me for it 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:11.879
 so look over there kin 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:16.169
 still there is even in anton and and dangerous 

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:19.049
 dangerously dangerous vodka him golden in 

00:03:16.169 --> 00:03:22.290
 secret they patchuk and I forgot to choose a class 

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:22.739
 yes it is very bad of default my class 

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:25.440
 now 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:28.409
 but if I have fun paw armor 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:32.150
 would make me a lot less about her 

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:34.560
 in the face all killed me oh god so 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:36.569
 tense struggle in us leads us so 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:40.769
 only one comment left 

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:44.129
 the red and blue team won so 

00:03:40.769 --> 00:03:46.109
 here is the next card and now is not yet 

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:48.629
 there were dynamite we will need to where 

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:50.940
 no filing hide and that's about where 

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:53.609
 something you hit I chose all the same 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:57.690
 class over there again, we will not 

00:03:53.609 --> 00:04:01.169
 while kids are 25, he's the one to do, and while I'm 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:05.310
 accumulating accumulating there it is generally already 

00:04:01.169 --> 00:04:05.879
 We are overwhelmed with shelling now here 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:09.389
 somehow 

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:13.319
 mb I'll go up he lies there dudets iiii 

00:04:09.389 --> 00:04:14.540
 dangerous very dangerous somehow like this 

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:19.250
 here threw 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:23.330
 and see we play for any topic 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:25.340
 now we are not what we do you stayed 

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:27.470
 we do not have a big advantage in principle 

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:29.080
 now it will be possible to throw it 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:33.020
 dude 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:37.580
 still lives he lives so here is pretty 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:40.430
 not bad I think how much dynamite 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:43.400
 dynamite in one place go nuts so now 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:46.849
 some way over there i'm over here 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:51.139
 something I jumped like that 

00:04:46.849 --> 00:04:55.330
 dude over there so well they draw something i 

00:04:51.139 --> 00:05:03.020
 for some reason I don't see you leaving ppd and 

00:04:55.330 --> 00:05:07.099
 besides the court and somewhere here someone 

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:09.560
 die one dude was ok understood 

00:05:07.099 --> 00:05:10.400
 again you would see and now will be 

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:13.400
 the next 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:16.849
 and again we have such a map 

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:19.099
 in the style of a wall such towers 2 3 even 

00:05:16.849 --> 00:05:21.320
 towers can go upstairs and then 

00:05:19.099 --> 00:05:25.639
 get out of there do something well i 

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:28.039
 I think now then immediately shoot down ah yes 

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:29.330
 yes yes yes yes yes yes I was right like that 

00:05:28.039 --> 00:05:32.330
 I will fall down I will fall 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:34.760
 and now take away here, I would have 

00:05:32.330 --> 00:05:37.370
 amassed enough dynamite to it that 

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:41.690
 tower to leave and so there is something 

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:44.389
 break and watch 2 red left yes 

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:47.330
 what kind of iz generally one red which 

00:05:44.389 --> 00:05:49.150
 now I was already banim i'm sure either he 

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:53.330
 will live very long but it is unlikely 

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:57.289
 so almost all out he lives 

00:05:53.330 --> 00:06:02.389
 Antonov's cinema and she's so good there 

00:05:57.289 --> 00:06:05.419
 cinema you all seems they will be such 

00:06:02.389 --> 00:06:09.889
 such a dude they are so artykova done but 

00:06:05.419 --> 00:06:13.460
 I think I blew it there and now it will be 

00:06:09.889 --> 00:06:15.710
 one more is the same card again 

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:18.050
 and now now we are playing for 

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:20.479
 the red team is finally like that now 

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:23.430
 it is necessary to immediately throw back that guy in 

00:06:20.479 --> 00:06:26.910
 principle he condemn i about him half a penny 

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:30.420
 so client where he threw go nuts so much 

00:06:26.910 --> 00:06:32.880
 the meat on this map is generally ok 

00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:35.810
 now for a long time to not get the stones 

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:38.580
 such now we run, I was left alone 

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:42.930
 try to exhale ohh no there is impossible 

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:45.000
 pull out oh my goodness Well guys here such 

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:47.550
