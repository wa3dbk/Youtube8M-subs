in<00:00:03.030> my<00:00:03.180> previous<00:00:03.390> video<00:00:03.750> talking<00:00:04.319> about<00:00:04.470> the

00:00:04.699 --> 00:00:04.709 
in my previous video talking about the

00:00:04.709 --> 00:00:06.739 
in my previous video talking about the
blade<00:00:04.919> 130<00:00:05.430> X<00:00:05.700> and<00:00:05.910> all<00:00:05.999> the<00:00:06.209> problems<00:00:06.450> that

00:00:06.739 --> 00:00:06.749 
blade 130 X and all the problems that

00:00:06.749 --> 00:00:09.799 
blade 130 X and all the problems that
people<00:00:07.350> are<00:00:07.559> finding<00:00:08.210> mainly<00:00:09.210> because<00:00:09.360> of<00:00:09.540> the

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
people are finding mainly because of the

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.409 
people are finding mainly because of the
tail<00:00:11.210> wagging<00:00:12.210> or<00:00:12.419> a<00:00:13.110> lot<00:00:13.320> of<00:00:13.440> tail<00:00:13.650> bounce

00:00:14.409 --> 00:00:14.419 
tail wagging or a lot of tail bounce

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:17.840 
tail wagging or a lot of tail bounce
there's<00:00:15.419> also<00:00:15.629> other<00:00:15.900> problems<00:00:16.170> where<00:00:16.850> when

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
there's also other problems where when

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.179 
there's also other problems where when
she's<00:00:18.060> at<00:00:18.240> 0<00:00:18.689> pitch<00:00:19.019> coming<00:00:19.439> down<00:00:19.740> from<00:00:20.070> a

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
she's at 0 pitch coming down from a

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.429 
she's at 0 pitch coming down from a
high-speed<00:00:20.760> flight<00:00:21.240> she<00:00:21.630> has<00:00:21.840> a<00:00:21.869> little<00:00:22.380> bit

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439 
high-speed flight she has a little bit

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.950 
high-speed flight she has a little bit
of<00:00:22.560> a<00:00:22.590> wobble<00:00:22.830> a<00:00:23.820> lot<00:00:24.179> of<00:00:24.269> these<00:00:24.359> problems<00:00:24.630> are

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:24.960 
of a wobble a lot of these problems are

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.009 
of a wobble a lot of these problems are
due<00:00:25.199> to<00:00:25.320> maintenance<00:00:26.179> what<00:00:27.179> I<00:00:27.210> found<00:00:27.480> if

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
due to maintenance what I found if

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:29.870 
due to maintenance what I found if
you're<00:00:28.410> coming<00:00:28.619> down<00:00:28.740> from<00:00:29.039> 0<00:00:29.310> pitch<00:00:29.580> and

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
you're coming down from 0 pitch and

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:32.480 
you're coming down from 0 pitch and
you've<00:00:30.509> got<00:00:30.660> a<00:00:30.689> little<00:00:30.900> bit<00:00:30.990> of<00:00:31.080> shake<00:00:31.490> clean

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:32.490 
you've got a little bit of shake clean

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:34.340 
you've got a little bit of shake clean
your<00:00:32.610> servos<00:00:33.030> it's<00:00:33.450> highly<00:00:33.690> recommended<00:00:33.870> that

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:34.350 
your servos it's highly recommended that

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:35.869 
your servos it's highly recommended that
the<00:00:34.500> servos<00:00:34.829> be<00:00:35.010> cleaned<00:00:35.309> after<00:00:35.489> a<00:00:35.610> few

00:00:35.869 --> 00:00:35.879 
the servos be cleaned after a few

00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:37.549 
the servos be cleaned after a few
flights<00:00:36.120> I<00:00:36.450> find<00:00:36.780> that<00:00:36.899> they<00:00:37.050> carbon<00:00:37.440> out

00:00:37.549 --> 00:00:37.559 
flights I find that they carbon out

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:40.250 
flights I find that they carbon out
after<00:00:37.980> about<00:00:38.190> 10<00:00:38.520> flights<00:00:38.899> take<00:00:39.899> the<00:00:40.020> server

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
after about 10 flights take the server

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.069 
after about 10 flights take the server
apart<00:00:40.710> clean<00:00:41.219> the<00:00:41.370> carbon<00:00:41.760> off<00:00:42.450> of<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:42.780> wiper

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
apart clean the carbon off of the wiper

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.470 
apart clean the carbon off of the wiper
arm<00:00:43.110> and<00:00:43.559> you'll<00:00:44.399> be<00:00:44.520> good<00:00:44.670> to<00:00:44.730> go<00:00:44.850> she'll<00:00:45.300> fly

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:45.480 
arm and you'll be good to go she'll fly

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:47.569 
arm and you'll be good to go she'll fly
just<00:00:45.780> as<00:00:45.930> good<00:00:46.050> as<00:00:46.199> new<00:00:46.410> and<00:00:46.890> also<00:00:47.190> extend<00:00:47.520> the

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
just as good as new and also extend the

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.430 
just as good as new and also extend the
life<00:00:47.789> of<00:00:47.879> your<00:00:47.940> servo<00:00:48.480> the<00:00:49.079> other<00:00:49.230> thing<00:00:49.410> that

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
life of your servo the other thing that

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.450 
life of your servo the other thing that
I<00:00:49.559> found<00:00:50.120> mainly<00:00:51.120> due<00:00:51.300> to<00:00:51.329> tail<00:00:52.289> wag<00:00:52.590> to

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460 
I found mainly due to tail wag to

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.790 
I found mainly due to tail wag to
ongoing<00:00:54.120> problem<00:00:54.539> previous<00:00:55.230> video<00:00:55.469> I<00:00:55.559> showed

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
ongoing problem previous video I showed

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.680 
ongoing problem previous video I showed
of<00:00:55.920> all<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.250> changes<00:00:56.609> that<00:00:56.730> I<00:00:56.789> made<00:00:57.030> to<00:00:57.660> the

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
of all the changes that I made to the

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.830 
of all the changes that I made to the
rear<00:00:58.440> of<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.620> heli<00:00:59.120> one<00:01:00.120> thing<00:01:00.359> that<00:01:00.539> I<00:01:00.570> have

the<00:01:25.950> issue<00:01:26.070> that<00:01:26.430> I<00:01:26.460> was<00:01:26.610> having<00:01:27.050> this<00:01:28.050> one<00:01:28.260> was

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:28.440 
the issue that I was having this one was

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:29.870 
the issue that I was having this one was
bent<00:01:28.650> right<00:01:28.830> out<00:01:28.950> of<00:01:29.010> the<00:01:29.130> package<00:01:29.490> if<00:01:29.640> I<00:01:29.730> was

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:29.880 
bent right out of the package if I was

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:31.730 
bent right out of the package if I was
to<00:01:30.030> stick<00:01:30.240> it<00:01:30.360> on<00:01:30.420> the<00:01:30.570> heli<00:01:30.750> you<00:01:31.320> would<00:01:31.470> see

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
to stick it on the heli you would see

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.490 
to stick it on the heli you would see
this<00:01:32.010> end<00:01:32.280> bounce<00:01:32.700> up<00:01:32.970> and<00:01:33.060> down<00:01:33.300> if<00:01:34.080> you<00:01:34.320> do

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
this end bounce up and down if you do

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.490 
this end bounce up and down if you do
not<00:01:34.650> have<00:01:34.890> a<00:01:34.920> straight<00:01:35.510> torque<00:01:36.510> tube<00:01:36.750> your

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
not have a straight torque tube your

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.440 
not have a straight torque tube your
heli<00:01:37.830> will<00:01:38.160> vibrate<00:01:38.400> you<00:01:39.030> will<00:01:39.210> have<00:01:39.420> a

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
heli will vibrate you will have a

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.880 
heli will vibrate you will have a
tremendous<00:01:40.080> amount<00:01:40.290> of<00:01:41.090> tail<00:01:42.090> wag<00:01:42.770> take<00:01:43.770> the

straighten it out balance it you're not

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.890 
straighten it out balance it you're not
really<00:01:47.040> bending<00:01:47.640> this<00:01:47.880> you're<00:01:48.210> just<00:01:48.480> changing

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:48.900 
really bending this you're just changing

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.760 
really bending this you're just changing
the<00:01:49.470> way<00:01:49.790> that<00:01:50.790> the<00:01:50.910> system<00:01:51.240> is<00:01:51.360> out<00:01:51.510> around

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
the way that the system is out around

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.050 
the way that the system is out around
and<00:01:52.770> you're<00:01:52.890> putting<00:01:53.130> it<00:01:53.220> back<00:01:53.400> into<00:01:53.640> normal

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
and you're putting it back into normal

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.630 
and you're putting it back into normal
configuration<00:01:54.240> and<00:01:55.190> assemble<00:01:56.190> it<00:01:56.280> and<00:01:56.310> fly<00:01:56.610> it
