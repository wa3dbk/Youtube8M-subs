00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
USB 3.0 cable this cable is backwards

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.160 
USB 3.0 cable this cable is backwards
compatible<00:02:11.489> to<00:02:11.670> 2.0<00:02:12.209> so<00:02:12.420> even<00:02:12.690> if<00:02:12.810> it<00:02:13.020> looks

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170

like
this<00:02:13.750> on<00:02:14.409> one<00:02:14.799> end<00:02:15.010> this<00:02:15.220> goes<00:02:15.400> into<00:02:15.610> the<00:02:15.700> hard

00:02:15.899 --> 00:02:15.909 
this on one end this goes into the hard

00:02:15.909 --> 00:02:17.940 
this on one end this goes into the hard
drive<00:02:15.970> this<00:02:16.330> goes<00:02:16.540> into<00:02:16.780> the<00:02:16.900> actual<00:02:17.080> hard

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
drive this goes into the actual hard

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.940 
drive this goes into the actual hard
drive<00:02:18.840> you<00:02:19.840> can<00:02:19.989> see<00:02:20.200> here<00:02:20.500> let's<00:02:20.680> bring<00:02:20.709> the

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
drive you can see here let's bring the

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.160 
drive you can see here let's bring the
hard<00:02:21.099> drive<00:02:21.310> up<00:02:21.459> closer<00:02:22.079> there's<00:02:23.079> a

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
hard drive up closer there's a

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.539 
hard drive up closer there's a
connection<00:02:25.110> here's<00:02:26.110> the<00:02:26.260> connection<00:02:26.470> so<00:02:27.459> you

00:02:27.539 --> 00:02:27.549 
connection here's the connection so you

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:29.280 
connection here's the connection so you
can<00:02:27.700> see<00:02:27.849> that<00:02:28.090> goes<00:02:28.269> there<00:02:28.629> so<00:02:28.810> this<00:02:29.019> is<00:02:29.079> where

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.290 
can see that goes there so this is where

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:31.740 
can see that goes there so this is where
the<00:02:29.379> hard<00:02:29.590> drive<00:02:29.829> cable<00:02:30.069> goes<00:02:30.459> this<00:02:31.360> goes<00:02:31.569> into

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
the hard drive cable goes this goes into

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.449 
the hard drive cable goes this goes into
your<00:02:31.840> computer<00:02:31.900> but<00:02:32.560> keep<00:02:32.860> in<00:02:33.010> mind<00:02:33.040> that<00:02:33.280> it

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
your computer but keep in mind that it

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:35.610 
your computer but keep in mind that it
is<00:02:33.549> compatible<00:02:33.940> with<00:02:34.209> 2.0<00:02:34.959> connections<00:02:35.470> you

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
is compatible with 2.0 connections you

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:39.420 
is compatible with 2.0 connections you
just<00:02:35.829> won't<00:02:35.980> get<00:02:36.220> as<00:02:36.430> fast<00:02:37.420> read<00:02:37.750> speeds<00:02:38.430> all

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:39.430 
just won't get as fast read speeds all

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:51.809 
just won't get as fast read speeds all
right<00:02:49.769> so<00:02:50.769> it<00:02:50.890> looks<00:02:51.040> like<00:02:51.099> this<00:02:51.400> is<00:02:51.549> just<00:02:51.760> a

00:02:51.809 --> 00:02:51.819 
right so it looks like this is just a

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:54.569 
right so it looks like this is just a
quick<00:02:52.030> installation<00:02:52.389> guide<00:02:53.370> tells<00:02:54.370> you<00:02:54.489> the

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:54.579 
quick installation guide tells you the

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:56.220 
quick installation guide tells you the
components<00:02:55.209> tells<00:02:55.510> you<00:02:55.629> how<00:02:55.780> to<00:02:55.840> work<00:02:56.049> the

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
components tells you how to work the

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.460 
components tells you how to work the
software<00:02:56.889> and<00:02:57.870> so<00:02:58.870> forth

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
software and so forth

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.860 
software and so forth
so<00:03:00.010> really<00:03:00.370> not<00:03:00.670> much<00:03:00.849> information<00:03:01.450> there<00:03:01.599> not

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
so really not much information there not

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:03.300 
so really not much information there not
that<00:03:02.019> you're<00:03:02.109> gonna<00:03:02.170> need<00:03:02.440> much<00:03:02.680> information

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:03.310 
that you're gonna need much information

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:08.339 
that you're gonna need much information
anyway<00:03:05.370> alright<00:03:06.840> it<00:03:07.840> looks<00:03:07.989> like<00:03:08.109> it's<00:03:08.260> a

00:03:08.339 --> 00:03:08.349 
anyway alright it looks like it's a

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:11.930 
anyway alright it looks like it's a
relatively<00:03:08.739> thin<00:03:09.069> hard<00:03:09.340> drive<00:03:10.650> compact

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
relatively thin hard drive compact

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:14.849 
relatively thin hard drive compact
obviously<00:03:12.940> this<00:03:13.060> is<00:03:13.209> using<00:03:13.599> the<00:03:13.930> smaller<00:03:14.379> hard

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:14.859 
obviously this is using the smaller hard

00:03:14.859 --> 00:03:17.849 
obviously this is using the smaller hard
drives<00:03:15.340> us<00:03:15.909> for<00:03:16.180> serial<00:03:16.480> ata<00:03:16.750> connections<00:03:17.290> but

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:17.859 
drives us for serial ata connections but

00:03:17.859 --> 00:03:21.569 
drives us for serial ata connections but
it's<00:03:18.010> pretty<00:03:18.370> solid<00:03:18.609> seems<00:03:19.299> pretty<00:03:20.250> sturdy<00:03:21.250> it

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:21.579 
it's pretty solid seems pretty sturdy it

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:23.069 
it's pretty solid seems pretty sturdy it
doesn't<00:03:21.910> seem<00:03:22.120> like<00:03:22.299> nothing's<00:03:22.690> moving

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:23.079 
doesn't seem like nothing's moving

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:24.180 
doesn't seem like nothing's moving
inside<00:03:23.379> so<00:03:23.590> that's<00:03:23.709> good<00:03:24.010> because

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:24.190 
inside so that's good because

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:26.250 
inside so that's good because
portability<00:03:25.000> dropping<00:03:25.510> these<00:03:25.660> things<00:03:25.900> is<00:03:26.079> not

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:26.260 
portability dropping these things is not

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:26.729 
portability dropping these things is not
ideal

00:03:26.729 --> 00:03:26.739 
ideal

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:30.330 
ideal
I<00:03:27.090> like<00:03:28.090> the<00:03:28.209> red<00:03:28.329> and<00:03:28.510> the<00:03:28.930> black<00:03:29.079> do<00:03:29.620> 2-toned

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
I like the red and the black do 2-toned

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:33.330 
I like the red and the black do 2-toned
a<00:03:30.609> case<00:03:31.449> it's<00:03:31.870> pretty<00:03:32.079> nice<00:03:32.260> feels<00:03:33.010> good<00:03:33.220> in

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
a case it's pretty nice feels good in

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.580 
a case it's pretty nice feels good in
your<00:03:33.370> hand<00:03:33.489> feel<00:03:34.419> solid<00:03:35.049> it<00:03:35.139> doesn't<00:03:35.169> feel

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
your hand feel solid it doesn't feel

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:38.640 
your hand feel solid it doesn't feel
flimsy<00:03:35.819> so<00:03:37.139> I'll<00:03:38.139> see<00:03:38.319> how<00:03:38.440> this<00:03:38.590> thing

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:38.650 
flimsy so I'll see how this thing

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:40.140 
flimsy so I'll see how this thing
performs<00:03:39.160> but<00:03:39.370> I'm<00:03:39.519> guessing<00:03:39.819> this<00:03:39.910> is<00:03:39.970> going

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:40.150 
performs but I'm guessing this is going

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:41.640 
performs but I'm guessing this is going
to<00:03:40.209> be<00:03:40.269> pretty<00:03:40.419> good<00:03:40.569> and<00:03:40.750> for<00:03:40.900> 59<00:03:41.290> bucks

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:41.650 
to be pretty good and for 59 bucks

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:44.009 
to be pretty good and for 59 bucks
I<00:03:41.829> really<00:03:42.519> can't<00:03:42.730> beat<00:03:42.910> it<00:03:42.940> so<00:03:43.660> this<00:03:43.840> is<00:03:43.930> the

00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:44.019 
I really can't beat it so this is the

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:46.800 
I really can't beat it so this is the
unboxing<00:03:44.139> of<00:03:44.769> the<00:03:44.980> Toshiba<00:03:45.579> automatic<00:03:46.389> backup

unboxing of the Toshiba automatic backup

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.379 
unboxing of the Toshiba automatic backup
