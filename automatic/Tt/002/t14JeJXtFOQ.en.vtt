00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
it's safe is just to go with a 32-bit

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.710 
it's safe is just to go with a 32-bit
version<00:01:51.180> as<00:01:51.509> it<00:01:51.780> should<00:01:51.960> work<00:01:52.140> on<00:01:52.290> everything

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:53.720

which<00:03:39.450> one<00:03:39.600> to<00:03:39.720> choose<00:03:39.780> you<00:03:40.590> can<00:03:40.710> just<00:03:40.890> leave

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:41.040 
which one to choose you can just leave

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.190 
which one to choose you can just leave
it<00:03:41.130> on<00:03:41.270> h.264<00:03:42.270> it<00:03:42.420> doesn't<00:03:42.720> really<00:03:42.810> matter

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:43.200 
it on h.264 it doesn't really matter

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.830 
it on h.264 it doesn't really matter
I<00:03:43.320> find<00:03:44.280> that<00:03:44.430> encoding<00:03:45.060> it<00:03:45.150> with<00:03:45.240> mpeg-4

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 
I find that encoding it with mpeg-4

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.450 
I find that encoding it with mpeg-4
works<00:03:46.110> a<00:03:46.200> little<00:03:46.470> bit<00:03:46.650> faster<00:03:47.100> but<00:03:47.220> it's<00:03:47.340> not

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:47.460 
works a little bit faster but it's not

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:48.590 
works a little bit faster but it's not
something<00:03:47.610> you<00:03:47.730> really<00:03:48.090> need<00:03:48.210> to<00:03:48.330> work<00:03:48.510> a

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
something you really need to work a

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.930 
something you really need to work a
worry<00:03:49.020> about<00:03:49.290> and<00:03:49.590> you<00:03:50.220> can<00:03:50.250> also<00:03:50.460> choose<00:03:50.730> your

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
worry about and you can also choose your

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:52.670 
worry about and you can also choose your
frame<00:03:51.180> rates<00:03:51.420> you<00:03:51.660> can<00:03:51.810> leave<00:03:51.930> that<00:03:51.960> alone<00:03:52.170> too

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
frame rates you can leave that alone too

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.190 
frame rates you can leave that alone too
there's<00:03:53.400> a<00:03:53.490> quality<00:03:53.760> slider<00:03:54.180> here<00:03:54.540> and<00:03:54.720> if<00:03:55.080> you

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:55.200 
there's a quality slider here and if you

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.570 
there's a quality slider here and if you
want<00:03:55.350> the<00:03:55.470> highest<00:03:55.620> quality<00:03:56.070> video<00:03:56.160> I<00:03:56.370> would

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:56.580 
want the highest quality video I would

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:58.850 
want the highest quality video I would
suggest<00:03:56.760> putting<00:03:57.480> it<00:03:57.600> all<00:03:57.720> the<00:03:57.780> way<00:03:57.900> up<00:03:58.020> you

00:03:58.850 --> 00:03:58.860 
suggest putting it all the way up you

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:00.650 
suggest putting it all the way up you
can<00:03:59.010> also<00:03:59.160> choose<00:03:59.490> your<00:03:59.550> bitrate<00:03:59.970> and<00:04:00.030> target

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:00.660 
can also choose your bitrate and target

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:03.440 
can also choose your bitrate and target
size<00:04:00.900> megabytes<00:04:01.820> those<00:04:02.820> aren't<00:04:03.270> really

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:03.450 
size megabytes those aren't really

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:04.430 
size megabytes those aren't really
something<00:04:03.720> you<00:04:03.780> really<00:04:03.960> need<00:04:04.080> to<00:04:04.170> play<00:04:04.290> with

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:04.440 
something you really need to play with

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:06.340 
something you really need to play with
either<00:04:04.560> and<00:04:05.340> down<00:04:05.520> here<00:04:05.670> it<00:04:05.760> just<00:04:05.910> tells<00:04:06.120> you

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:06.350 
either and down here it just tells you

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:09.440 
either and down here it just tells you
what<00:04:07.350> your<00:04:07.500> picture<00:04:07.860> size<00:04:08.190> sources<00:04:08.880> and<00:04:09.060> the

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.450 
what your picture size sources and the

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:10.670 
what your picture size sources and the
output<00:04:09.840> and<00:04:09.990> resolution

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
output and resolution

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:14.120 
output and resolution
so<00:04:11.280> it's<00:04:11.610> 720<00:04:12.090> by<00:04:12.210> 480<00:04:12.570> and<00:04:13.170> I'll<00:04:13.320> put<00:04:13.530> a<00:04:13.560> 720<00:04:14.040> by

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:14.130 
so it's 720 by 480 and I'll put a 720 by

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:17.930 
so it's 720 by 480 and I'll put a 720 by
480<00:04:15.109> and<00:04:16.109> up<00:04:16.290> here<00:04:16.500> you<00:04:16.620> can<00:04:16.830> add<00:04:17.130> things<00:04:17.670> to

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
480 and up here you can add things to

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:20.599 
480 and up here you can add things to
your<00:04:18.030> cue<00:04:18.270> to<00:04:18.480> encode<00:04:19.190> while<00:04:20.190> you're<00:04:20.340> encoding

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:24.210 
what's in the cue and there's nothing in

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:24.740 
what's in the cue and there's nothing in

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:03.030 
happens when you start it because I

00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:05.180 
happens when you start it because I
really<00:05:03.720> want<00:05:04.080> to<00:05:04.140> abide<00:05:04.380> by<00:05:04.440> copyright<00:05:05.010> laws

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:08.310 
so it says encoding here and it does in

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:10.340 
so it says encoding here and it does in
one<00:05:08.550> pass<00:05:08.850> you<00:05:09.120> can<00:05:09.300> choose<00:05:09.480> to<00:05:09.750> pass<00:05:09.930> right

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:10.350 
one pass you can choose to pass right

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:12.410 
one pass you can choose to pass right
here<00:05:10.500> and<00:05:10.950> it<00:05:11.730> tells<00:05:11.910> you<00:05:12.030> how<00:05:12.150> long<00:05:12.180> it's

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:13.560 
going to take now that says this is

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:15.350

going to take three hours and 22 minutes
to<00:05:15.570> complete<00:05:15.900> and<00:05:16.140> it's<00:05:16.950> actually<00:05:17.250> going<00:05:17.370> down

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:17.490 
to complete and it's actually going down

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:20.270 
to complete and it's actually going down
quite<00:05:17.850> fast<00:05:18.060> but<00:05:18.410> so<00:05:19.410> this<00:05:19.650> is<00:05:19.830> going<00:05:20.040> to<00:05:20.130> take

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:20.280 
quite fast but so this is going to take

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:22.570 
quite fast but so this is going to take
a<00:05:20.310> while<00:05:20.550> it's<00:05:20.880> not<00:05:21.090> even<00:05:21.390> you<00:05:21.720> know<00:05:21.750> Oh<00:05:22.050> point

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:22.580 
a while it's not even you know Oh point

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:26.330 
a while it's not even you know Oh point
15%<00:05:23.580> through<00:05:23.820> it<00:05:23.940> so<00:05:24.570> you<00:05:25.230> know<00:05:25.350> go<00:05:26.130> do

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:26.340 
15% through it so you know go do

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:27.680 
15% through it so you know go do
something<00:05:26.640> else<00:05:26.730> while<00:05:26.970> this<00:05:27.150> is<00:05:27.300> working

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:27.690 
something else while this is working

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:29.420 
something else while this is working
because<00:05:27.840> it<00:05:28.620> will<00:05:28.800> take<00:05:28.980> a<00:05:29.010> while<00:05:29.130> now<00:05:29.340> I'm

00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:29.430 
because it will take a while now I'm

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:30.770 
because it will take a while now I'm
just<00:05:29.550> going<00:05:29.670> to<00:05:29.760> hit<00:05:29.850> stop<00:05:30.120> because<00:05:30.420> I<00:05:30.600> don't

00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:30.780 
just going to hit stop because I don't

00:05:30.780 --> 00:05:33.560 
just going to hit stop because I don't
really<00:05:30.930> want<00:05:31.050> to<00:05:31.260> do<00:05:31.350> this<00:05:31.470> now<00:05:32.390> but<00:05:33.390> I<00:05:33.450> will

now everyone this is a tutorial on how
to<00:05:53.940> use<00:05:54.120> handbrake

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:54.930 
to use handbrake

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:57.320 
to use handbrake
now<00:05:55.320> what<00:05:55.530> handbrake<00:05:55.950> is<00:05:56.220> so<00:05:56.850> you<00:05:56.940> can<00:05:57.060> kind<00:05:57.270> of

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:57.330 
now what handbrake is so you can kind of

00:05:57.330 --> 00:05:59.600 
now what handbrake is so you can kind of
see<00:05:57.510> the<00:05:57.750> video<00:05:58.290> there<00:05:58.560> and<00:05:58.800> it's<00:05:59.100> you<00:05:59.580> know

fairly good quality and I have the

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:05.240 
fairly good quality and I have the
source<00:06:03.540> already<00:06:03.930> selected<00:06:04.410> and<00:06:04.740> that<00:06:04.800> is<00:06:05.100> the

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:05.250

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:08.900 
movie on the desktop now I'm going to
leave<00:06:07.320> pretty<00:06:07.590> much<00:06:07.740> everything<00:06:08.190> alone<00:06:08.460> I'm

00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:08.910 
leave pretty much everything alone I'm

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:18.330 
subtitles advanced and chapters tabs now

00:06:18.330 --> 00:06:20.030 
subtitles advanced and chapters tabs now
these<00:06:18.540> are<00:06:18.720> tabs<00:06:18.960> that<00:06:19.080> unless<00:06:19.410> you're<00:06:19.620> a<00:06:19.650> pro

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:20.040 
these are tabs that unless you're a pro

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:21.440 
these are tabs that unless you're a pro
user<00:06:20.310> you<00:06:20.550> really<00:06:20.820> don't<00:06:21.000> have<00:06:21.120> to<00:06:21.300> worry

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:21.450 
user you really don't have to worry

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:24.230 
user you really don't have to worry
about<00:06:21.480> there<00:06:22.290> are<00:06:22.530> nothing<00:06:22.860> too<00:06:23.100> complex<00:06:23.820> or

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:24.240 
about there are nothing too complex or

00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:26.990 
about there are nothing too complex or
they're<00:06:24.510> pretty<00:06:24.690> complex<00:06:25.080> so<00:06:25.530> you<00:06:26.490> probably

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:27.000 
they're pretty complex so you probably

00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.580 
they're pretty complex so you probably
don't<00:06:27.150> want<00:06:27.360> to<00:06:27.420> use<00:06:27.570> them<00:06:27.720> unless<00:06:27.990> you<00:06:28.200> really

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:28.590 
don't want to use them unless you really

00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:31.280 
don't want to use them unless you really
feel<00:06:28.950> like<00:06:28.980> you<00:06:29.280> need<00:06:29.490> to<00:06:29.540> they're<00:06:30.540> somewhat

00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:31.290 
feel like you need to they're somewhat

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:34.220 
feel like you need to they're somewhat
confusing<00:06:31.950> and<00:06:32.250> you<00:06:32.600> generally<00:06:33.600> won't<00:06:34.050> need

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:34.230 
confusing and you generally won't need

00:06:34.230 --> 00:06:35.690 
confusing and you generally won't need
to<00:06:34.320> use<00:06:34.350> them<00:06:34.620> so<00:06:35.130> I'm<00:06:35.190> just<00:06:35.310> going<00:06:35.460> to<00:06:35.610> hit

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:35.700 
to use them so I'm just going to hit

00:06:35.700 --> 00:06:38.510 
to use them so I'm just going to hit
start<00:06:36.000> and<00:06:36.440> this<00:06:37.440> is<00:06:37.560> about<00:06:37.740> a<00:06:37.770> six<00:06:38.190> minute

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:38.520 
start and this is about a six minute

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:40.700 
start and this is about a six minute
video<00:06:38.630> so<00:06:39.630> it's

00:06:40.700 --> 00:06:40.710 
video so it's

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:43.790 
video so it's
going<00:06:40.890> to<00:06:41.810> encode<00:06:42.810> it<00:06:42.960> right<00:06:43.140> now<00:06:43.290> and<00:06:43.560> this<00:06:43.680> is

00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:43.800 
going to encode it right now and this is

00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:46.160 
going to encode it right now and this is
going<00:06:43.950> to<00:06:44.040> take<00:06:44.310> about<00:06:45.030> 23<00:06:45.660> minutes<00:06:46.020> it's

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:46.170 
going to take about 23 minutes it's

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:48.890 
going to take about 23 minutes it's
saying<00:06:46.380> so<00:06:47.130> I<00:06:47.550> will<00:06:47.850> come<00:06:48.450> back<00:06:48.570> when<00:06:48.750> it's

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:48.900 
saying so I will come back when it's

00:06:48.900 --> 00:06:51.590 
saying so I will come back when it's
done<00:06:49.020> and<00:06:49.200> I'll<00:06:49.290> show<00:06:49.440> you<00:06:49.560> the<00:06:49.680> quality<00:06:50.570> so<00:06:51.570> I

00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:51.600 
done and I'll show you the quality so I

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:54.010 
done and I'll show you the quality so I
finished<00:06:52.170> encoding<00:06:52.830> the<00:06:52.920> file<00:06:53.190> and<00:06:53.430> it

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:54.020 
finished encoding the file and it

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:58.400 
finished encoding the file and it
exports<00:06:55.020> in<00:06:55.200> a<00:06:55.440> dot<00:06:56.130> m4v<00:06:56.850> file<00:06:57.510> format<00:06:58.020> instead

00:06:58.400 --> 00:06:58.410 
exports in a dot m4v file format instead

00:06:58.410 --> 00:07:01.070 
exports in a dot m4v file format instead
of<00:06:58.710> the<00:06:58.830> dot<00:06:59.130> MOV<00:06:59.460> it<00:06:59.850> was<00:07:00.000> in<00:07:00.210> now<00:07:00.810> I'm<00:07:00.930> just

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:01.080 
of the dot MOV it was in now I'm just
