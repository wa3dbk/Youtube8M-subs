alcohol to make make its debut in the
u.s.<00:00:35.399> i<00:00:35.700> think<00:00:36.360> it's<00:00:36.480> a<00:00:36.600> it's<00:00:36.630> a<00:00:37.020> really

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
u.s. i think it's a it's a really

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.340 
u.s. i think it's a it's a really
difficult<00:00:37.410> process<00:00:38.040> you<00:00:38.850> know<00:00:38.969> you<00:00:39.540> have<00:00:39.690> mono

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
difficult process you know you have mono

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.709 
difficult process you know you have mono
not<00:00:40.590> it's<00:00:40.770> like<00:00:41.040> climbing<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.520> trees<00:00:41.790> and

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
not it's like climbing the trees and

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.869 
not it's like climbing the trees and
what<00:00:42.930> we<00:00:43.050> did<00:00:43.170> was<00:00:43.230> we<00:00:43.980> had<00:00:44.129> to<00:00:44.250> refine<00:00:44.640> that

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
what we did was we had to refine that

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:47.180 
what we did was we had to refine that
whole<00:00:45.090> collection<00:00:45.270> process<00:00:46.050> and<00:00:46.890> then

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
whole collection process and then

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.440 
whole collection process and then
there's<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:47.610> whole<00:00:47.730> distillation<00:00:48.300> process

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
there's the whole distillation process

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.990 
there's the whole distillation process
that<00:00:49.350> we<00:00:49.920> had<00:00:50.039> to<00:00:50.129> take<00:00:50.250> a<00:00:50.309> look<00:00:50.520> at<00:00:50.640> two<00:00:50.850> and

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:51.000 
that we had to take a look at two and

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.170 
that we had to take a look at two and
and<00:00:51.390> basically<00:00:51.899> redo<00:00:52.770> it<00:00:52.920> so<00:00:53.160> that<00:00:53.309> it<00:00:53.699> would

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
and basically redo it so that it would

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.020 
and basically redo it so that it would
work<00:00:54.539> well<00:00:55.170> here<00:00:55.530> now<00:00:55.800> in<00:00:56.100> the<00:00:56.250> US<00:00:56.520> definitely

there's this growing trend towards

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.580 
there's this growing trend towards
exotic<00:01:14.010> but<00:01:14.220> familiar<00:01:14.640> type<00:01:14.820> of<00:01:15.000> products<00:01:15.420> and

exotic but familiar type of products and
lumber<00:01:16.590> dog<00:01:16.710> you<00:01:16.860> can't<00:01:17.100> really<00:01:17.689> categorize

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
lumber dog you can't really categorize

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:21.020 
lumber dog you can't really categorize
it<00:01:18.869> and<00:01:19.290> so<00:01:19.650> the<00:01:19.860> closest<00:01:20.369> thing<00:01:20.610> that<00:01:20.640> we

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
it and so the closest thing that we

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.179 
it and so the closest thing that we
thought<00:01:21.360> of<00:01:21.540> was<00:01:21.780> vodka<00:01:22.049> but<00:01:22.830> in<00:01:22.950> order<00:01:23.100> to

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:23.189 
thought of was vodka but in order to

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.780 
thought of was vodka but in order to
attain<00:01:23.850> a<00:01:23.909> vodka<00:01:24.540> category<00:01:25.049> status<00:01:25.560> he<00:01:26.369> had<00:01:26.580> to

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
attain a vodka category status he had to

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.640 
attain a vodka category status he had to
really<00:01:27.240> refine<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:27.720> product<00:01:28.049> first<00:01:28.200> before

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
really refine the product first before

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.039 
really refine the product first before
we<00:01:28.799> could<00:01:28.950> call<00:01:29.100> it<00:01:29.220> that<00:01:29.280> so<00:01:29.610> we<00:01:30.270> did<00:01:30.750> that<00:01:30.780> it

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
we could call it that so we did that it

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:32.719 
we could call it that so we did that it
took<00:01:31.170> a<00:01:31.320> got<00:01:31.770> actually<00:01:32.189> took<00:01:32.280> a<00:01:32.340> couple<00:01:32.520> years

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
took a got actually took a couple years

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:36.100 
took a got actually took a couple years
