00:00:02.989 --> 00:00:09.270
 the baby food the best out of the door 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.700
 I had to take flights for that 

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:13.800
 my name claus hipp is the owner of 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:17.130
 world-famous family-owned hip 

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:18.179
 child food but the 73-year-old has 

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:20.789
 by the way many others 

00:00:18.179 --> 00:00:22.679
 Fields of activity and hobbies that's how he is 

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.939
 not only a lecturer in business administration 

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:26.369
 but also for art 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:29.279
 he paints music and speaks fluently 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.960
 Russian with pro language about his 

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:35.310
 company ethos and his personal 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:38.730
 Faith gives situations in which all 

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:40.830
 means are not available 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:43.980
 suffice and a faithful person can 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:47.820
 pray and do not hope to be stronger than 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.130
 that is not pure 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.720
 economical reasons 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:54.390
 Sometimes it is already good to believe 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:58.680
 Being an extortion can be that 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:00.540
 pressure is exercised and we do not 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:06.390
 other Central have not the people 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:09.499
 know and even at all, doing what 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:12.030
 do we boundaries are set 

00:01:09.499 --> 00:01:12.479
 where people are active happen too 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.859
 error 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:20.219
 and in that respect prayer is important 

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:21.869
 the work is good for the believer 

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:23.670
 Catholics come in his company 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:24.679
 again and again biblical principles 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.439
 to the validity 

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:31.499
 quite a few principles give you that 

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:32.369
 example from the markus gospel the 

00:01:31.499 --> 00:01:34.799
 seventh chapter 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:38.490
 there go the scribes and 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:41.069
 Pharisees complain themselves 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.929
 jesus that the younger with unwashed 

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:45.569
 Hands eat and many do not regulate 

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:50.130
 and then jesus brush pretty much 

00:01:45.569 --> 00:01:52.020
 together and madness that content 

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.060
 of the law important as the form of the 

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.119
 act 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:02:00.779
 and so it is often in our lives 

00:01:56.119 --> 00:02:01.920
 The form of the law can be against 

00:02:00.779 --> 00:02:04.229
 the people judge 

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:06.209
 capstone oral consul of georgia for 

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:08.729
 bavaria and Baden wÃ¼rttemberg and finds 

00:02:06.209 --> 00:02:10.200
 also still time for the painting he feels 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:11.300
 not burned out sometime 

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.600
 burned out 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.890
 more important on when I realize that 

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.550
 I'm not good at one anymore 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:22.010
 discipline then I stop 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:25.700
 So I think we need our doing 

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:28.730
 an orientation up and we 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:30.920
 we have to see that we do it for ourselves 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:33.020
 could not do anything that was a limb 

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.700
 we are not in the chain 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:37.430
 How much money are we in 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:39.430
 accumulate life but something out of it 

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:42.470
 what you do with it has become 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.520
 deal with it responsibly and 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.980
 responsibility also belongs to the 

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:49.580
 Responsibility of body and where in the 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:52.340
 own spirit and who abused there 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:55.520
 is driving at the very end 

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:57.290
 there is not responsible for that 

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:58.700
 company raises busy 2000 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:01.430
 employees and made one in the year 

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:03.530
 turnover of 500 million euro 

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:06.620
 company headquarters in pfaffenhofen leave pro 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:08.660
 day 15 million glasses of his baby and 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.550
 child food hip or as king of 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:12.020
 sustainability and eco 

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:14.240
 manager of the year chosen 

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:16.760
 For his company he set an ethic 

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:17.709
 We did not want a new law 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.450
 do 

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:23.060
 we did not want to complicate it but 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:25.340
 we wanted the way of thinking with us 

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:27.770
 to write down times that prevail 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.239
 the suppliers the customers the 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:32.630
 Employees employees on it 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:33.850
 can call that everyone knows how it is 

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:36.050
 actually should go 

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:37.610
 We also know that it is not always 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:39.970
 Of course we have ours 

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:42.410
 interests in the eye 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:45.709
 and we will represent them too 

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:48.140
 but if we represent interests 

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:50.080
 It always has to happen that way 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:52.670
 other people stay on the route 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:55.160
 pitt plays oboe and english horn in 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:56.630
 a Munich orchestra every morning 

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:58.340
 at half past five he closes the chapel 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:04:01.700
 Men's racing near the company headquarters 

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:04.820
 up and start the day with a prayer 

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:06.620
 dealing with creation 

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:08.930
 ahead of recognizing a creator 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:11.660
 that you have a higher obligation 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:13.090
 as if we only did that 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:16.570
 make marketing reasons 

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:18.010
 it is for a Christian entrepreneur 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:20.769
 of course, that's a creator 

00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:21.729
 there and that we are in responsibility 

00:04:20.769 --> 00:04:24.130
 stand 

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:27.120
 with the goods entrusted to us 

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:27.120
 deal accordingly
