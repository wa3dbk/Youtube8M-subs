00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:10.150
 hello to you, the fund of planets is with you today 

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:12.549
 there will be a review on a wonderful simulator 

00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:14.799
 which is called a filter in general it 

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:16.810
 running simulator you can say the most 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:19.330
 the best simulator of its genre such 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:21.310
 I have not seen any real analogues in general 

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:25.779
 great toy let's play me 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:29.830
 Now, so in general, I was looking for this game very 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:31.720
 long does it take for a long time still left in 

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:33.489
 Air finally found decided to do 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.280
 her review because the game is great 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:39.460
 still in general here's how we see here two 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:42.460
 joystick and with the help of hijaz tics we 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:46.690
 manage a person and go through various 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:50.320
 levels goal of the game in general here go from 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:52.690
 to the finish line is shorter now go shorter 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:54.280
 I don't know how to stay here 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:56.920
 let's try to become somehow 

00:00:54.280 --> 00:01:00.640
 management is very difficult to say 

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:04.180
 you need to learn to manage a person 

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:06.270
 then so on here the level will be 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:09.039
 it is often difficult to guard 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:11.289
 pass and then there will be a level with 

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:13.979
 skate can be still with a bike i 

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:17.020
 don't know about the bike that's about 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:20.500
 skate there are such levels here and here as 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:22.270
 did you go I do not know how I was there in 

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.580
 so let's try to get up like 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.510
 the poplars are already tired of running 

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:30.260
 really difficult 

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:34.490
 she's great but she's hard cows 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:36.490
 how would the game be done that is 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:40.340
 you need to really learn to manage 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:42.290
 somehow especially get up let's try 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:47.990
 restart click i just want to show 

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:52.600
 how can you even crawl a little 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:52.600
 damn 40 so 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:00.189
 come on come on come so choose it once 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:08.780
 how to run and my legs so well here's an example 

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.649
 for example, for some reason, his leg 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.649
 tilts back 

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:20.450
 need a pancake 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.450
 seriously how to do it 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:31.080
 it is necessary to tell on the ass about let's go 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:31.080
 go go go go hi 

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:40.219
 so here we are singing 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:46.530
 let's go let's go let's go let's go let's go 

00:02:40.219 --> 00:02:48.799
 so now how to become now like a helicopter 

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:52.519
 feet and flew 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:54.780
 in short , this is such an interesting toy 

00:02:52.519 --> 00:02:57.719
 kept there further pass the general 

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:00.269
 you need to learn to play it and a toy 

00:02:57.719 --> 00:03:03.000
 really interesting and very cool i 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:04.709
 I advise you not to play a great game on 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.489
