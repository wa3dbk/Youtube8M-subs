shortly we'll see the screen appear for

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:59.180 
shortly we'll see the screen appear for
about<00:00:57.239> two<00:00:57.659> seconds<00:00:58.230> I'm<00:00:58.409> guessing<00:00:58.859> and<00:00:59.070> then

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190 
about two seconds I'm guessing and then

let's<00:01:16.110> try<00:01:16.350> step<00:01:16.740> two<00:01:17.040> we'll<00:01:17.369> open<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:18.000> Dell

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
let's try step two we'll open the Dell

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.260 
let's try step two we'll open the Dell
laptop<00:01:18.930> case<00:01:19.290> lid<00:01:19.619> there's<00:01:20.369> our<00:01:20.640> screen<00:01:20.940> image

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:21.270 
laptop case lid there's our screen image

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.999 
laptop case lid there's our screen image
there<00:01:21.540> it<00:01:21.659> is<00:01:21.750> again<00:01:21.900> on<00:01:22.229> the<00:01:22.320> envision<00:01:22.740> and

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
there it is again on the envision and

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.700 
there it is again on the envision and
gone<00:01:24.440> okay<00:01:25.440> well<00:01:26.399> let's<00:01:26.670> try<00:01:26.880> the

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:27.710 
gone okay well let's try the

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:35.020 
gone okay well let's try the
ever-popular<00:01:28.850> function<00:01:30.590> f8<00:01:31.590> key<00:01:33.649> there<00:01:34.649> we<00:01:34.770> go

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:35.030 
ever-popular function f8 key there we go

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:40.480 
ever-popular function f8 key there we go
1001<00:01:36.030> it<00:01:36.240> does<00:01:36.390> do<00:01:36.720> and<00:01:37.049> gone<00:01:38.720> hmm

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:40.490 
1001 it does do and gone hmm

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:48.529 
1001 it does do and gone hmm
function<00:01:41.490> f8<00:01:44.179> but<00:01:45.179> to<00:01:45.479> laptop<00:01:46.080> screen<00:01:47.539> no

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
signal in the envision monitor so let's

00:01:51.750 --> 00:02:05.090 
signal in the envision monitor so let's
function<00:01:54.710> f8<00:01:55.710> again<00:01:56.810> and<00:02:00.800> 1001<00:02:01.800> 1002<00:02:02.520> gone<00:02:04.100> so

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
function f8 again and 1001 1002 gone so

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:06.499 
function f8 again and 1001 1002 gone so
