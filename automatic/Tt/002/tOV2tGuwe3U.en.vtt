00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:09.440
 in 2003 microsoft and launched a worldwide initiative here in brazil receive 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:11.899
 the name of learning partners 

00:00:11.899 --> 00:00:16.679
 The main objective of the initiative is to train community representatives 

00:00:16.679 --> 00:00:20.800
 school for use of new information technologies 

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.119
 and communication 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.439
 between partner programs in learning kristal school management of 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:30.579
 technologies 

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:35.340
 a partnership of microsoft secretary of education of são paulo and one of the 

00:00:35.339 --> 00:00:38.449
 top universities in the country a puc de são paulo 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:48.560
 but let's sign it because there the preparation of the studies in the school 

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:53.180
 what she sees in fact is this possibility 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:58.250
 to engage with a public school as a whole 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.359
 nor who does not have to do what must be done 

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:02.730
 today 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.440
 in each state's reservoir 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:06.180
 15 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.240
 the universities he also said that we have to analyze 

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.700
 the manager is not only the one who controls compliance with the laws and 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:15.990
 public policy 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.790
 but the manager is the one who gives 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.670
 school life interpreting law 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.970
 interprets accounts of the community that interprets 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.740
 what teachers do best that highlights that what's best 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:35.160
 stimulates that it is possible for the director to open the doors and 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.870
 of laboratories in all schools 

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:39.630
 after he realizes 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.149
 here you can change your management practices with the use of 

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:47.090
 tools with the use of technology 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.620
 so we go 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:53.010
 away from the public school system 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:56.010
 and so was going up from the fear of technology 

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.590
 because we have the majority 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:08.500
 were the theoretical conceptions and experiments carried out in other 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.269
 similar projects 

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:13.479
 with other regions of the country 

00:02:13.479 --> 00:02:17.359
 according to the education secretary of são paulo do state são paulo 

00:02:17.359 --> 00:02:22.320
 demonstrated interest in developing the technology management project 

00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:25.960
 with puc de são paulo and with the participation of microsoft 

00:02:27.139 --> 00:02:32.389
 is this project was rebuilt within this reality so it was 

00:02:32.389 --> 00:02:35.529
 reconstructed to six hands institutionally 

00:02:36.859 --> 00:02:39.909
 the school management and technology 

00:02:39.909 --> 00:02:44.200
 aims to train directors and coordinators for the use of 

00:02:44.199 --> 00:02:46.259
 communication information 

00:02:46.259 --> 00:02:50.399
 encourage them to disseminate this knowledge to the whole team 

00:02:50.399 --> 00:02:52.389
 pedagogical 

00:02:52.389 --> 00:02:55.119
 the program presents the soil with drowsiness 

00:02:55.119 --> 00:02:57.310
 with program initiatives from the 

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.559
 the federal government 

00:02:59.559 --> 00:03:02.899
 we are the educational reality of each state 

00:03:02.899 --> 00:03:06.759
 The central objective of the program is the development of 

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:09.019
 transformation of school reality 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:09.930
 supporter 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:12.930
 and the critical use of technologies 

00:03:17.189 --> 00:03:20.529
 we often have this technology 

00:03:20.529 --> 00:03:23.879
 but this technology is thrown into a corner 

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:27.949
 without knowing how to use 

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:29.729
 the most qi technology 

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:32.729
 but to the extent that it does not have enough scope 

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:35.659
 ends up making people 

00:03:35.659 --> 00:03:37.869
 has insisted that we are doing 

00:03:37.869 --> 00:03:41.419
 technology advances opportunity to know that our problems 

00:03:42.259 --> 00:03:47.789
 and our solutions are better when I change it more by 

00:03:47.789 --> 00:03:49.960
 example we have a lot of technology 

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:54.100
 which is not only the technology of the meter itself but we have many means of 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:57.910
 technology that can be applied very coherently in a very 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:01.059
 fast in school with a very good result 

00:04:01.059 --> 00:04:02.349
 the training course 

00:04:02.349 --> 00:04:04.899
 and mixed 

00:04:04.899 --> 00:04:08.299
 less than two face-to-face modules and two at a distance 

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:11.039
 the open nature 

00:04:11.039 --> 00:04:12.969
 information in action 

00:04:12.969 --> 00:04:15.969
 theory and practice 

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:20.909
 factions 

00:04:20.909 --> 00:04:22.300
 the 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:25.300
 carry out actions of their schools 

00:04:25.909 --> 00:04:27.539
 in remote modes 

00:04:27.539 --> 00:04:30.639
 with the support of the teachers who form the 

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:33.639
 managers have access to studies and experiences 

00:04:34.469 --> 00:04:36.740
 many technologies in the management 

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:40.520
 assess the actions in schools that exchange experiences 

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:43.449
 based on actual experiences 

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:46.930
 you have the condition of for example having an index as I did a 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:49.930
 diagnostic evaluation at school go through computer science 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:54.539
 to know how much they are always coming into the minds of fabet and cities in 

00:04:54.539 --> 00:04:58.160
 third or fourth series how many then not from there you take 

00:04:58.159 --> 00:05:02.789
 pedagogical decisions through the computerized class council 

00:05:02.789 --> 00:05:04.310
 on dc screens 

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:08.960
 greater agility in the class council and consequently the result 

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:11.009
 leave behind bulletin 

00:05:11.009 --> 00:05:13.580
 the current managers regarding the evening 

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:15.110
 throughout the process 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:18.990
 videoconferences are carried out by optimizing the rooms 

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:22.080
 computing or the poles of the knowledge network 

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:24.280
 Of the Education Department of São Paulo 

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:25.360
 do not try again 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:26.919
 I'm not 

00:05:26.919 --> 00:05:29.419
 easy accessing detail né 

00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:33.210
 with it is accessible even those that I do not have much knowledge in 

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:35.259
 computing at cp ap 

00:05:35.259 --> 00:05:38.189
 civility found support from other colleagues 

00:05:38.189 --> 00:05:42.189
 to solve problems here are often common with cutting-edge technology 

00:05:42.189 --> 00:05:43.659
 one more 

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:46.620
 a real contribution and that's what we want 

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:49.620
 only that this course is a path that 

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:55.550
 eli is the first of a large criminal group in this course I intend to form 10 

00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:58.869
 thousand managers of the public school of são paulo 

00:05:58.869 --> 00:06:02.879
 the formation system in such a way that those who today are formed 

00:06:03.729 --> 00:06:07.109
 began to be trainers participate in the training team 

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:09.389
 in the next games 

00:06:09.389 --> 00:06:12.389
 that such that the last course the presence of puc 

00:06:12.889 --> 00:06:17.970
 and margins and centering starts in a city will be the smallest possible 

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:23.169
 and the network itself will have disappeared the role reni that to exercise 

00:06:23.169 --> 00:06:25.589
 your own project 

00:06:25.589 --> 00:06:27.069
 at the end of the program 

00:06:27.069 --> 00:06:31.229
 The secretariat of education has the conditions to promote future 

00:06:31.229 --> 00:06:32.770
 training 

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:35.770
 broadening the scope of this initiative 

00:06:36.930 --> 00:06:38.770
 we also passed 

00:06:38.770 --> 00:06:41.069
 and always doing the same thing 

00:06:41.069 --> 00:06:42.449
 the same way 

00:06:42.449 --> 00:06:44.219
 and now suddenly 

00:06:44.219 --> 00:06:47.869
 we realize that opportunities are being given for people to 

00:06:48.699 --> 00:06:50.679
 for us to change so that people
