00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:33.360
 two-sided famous emblem of 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:37.759

 he was also pearly, but he was already 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:05.040
 on sharkan and glued on hot glue 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:05.869
 beads are the same pearl and mean 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:11.519

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:19.049
 I did, too, as a suspension 

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:22.220

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:47.500
 At once 

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:49.690
