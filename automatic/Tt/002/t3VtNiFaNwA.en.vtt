00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:00.970 
what in the world is that about and then

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:02.990

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.210 
interesting and then finally we have a
limited<00:04:07.630> resolution<00:04:08.260> so<00:04:08.590> illustrator<00:04:09.100> is

00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:09.220 
limited resolution so illustrator is

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:11.070 
limited resolution so illustrator is
made<00:04:09.400> whatever<00:04:09.790> arbitrary<00:04:10.080> determination

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:11.080
