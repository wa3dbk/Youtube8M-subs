just<00:04:15.509> it's<00:04:16.509> kind<00:04:16.570> of<00:04:16.780> like<00:04:16.870> it's<00:04:17.109> a<00:04:17.169> two-parter

00:04:17.729 --> 00:04:17.739 
just it's kind of like it's a two-parter

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:21.060 
just it's kind of like it's a two-parter
in<00:04:17.829> a<00:04:17.889> way<00:04:18.009> into<00:04:18.220> one<00:04:18.400> episode<00:04:19.049> now<00:04:20.049> is<00:04:20.320> it<00:04:20.650> was

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:21.070 
in a way into one episode now is it was

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:23.460 
in a way into one episode now is it was
it<00:04:21.220> like<00:04:21.430> season<00:04:21.970> three<00:04:22.630> like<00:04:22.960> season<00:04:23.320> two

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:23.470 
it like season three like season two

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:28.290 
it like season three like season two
finale<00:04:23.710> not<00:04:24.370> exactly<00:04:25.680> it's<00:04:26.680> not<00:04:26.919> like<00:04:27.760> I<00:04:27.969> don't

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:31.300 
think it's gonna be like I'm pretty well

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:32.100 
think it's gonna be like I'm pretty well
sure<00:04:31.570> that<00:04:31.840> this

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:32.110 
sure that this

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:34.680 
sure that this
is<00:04:32.200> the<00:04:32.530> season<00:04:32.740> finale<00:04:33.040> like<00:04:33.880> I<00:04:33.970> don't<00:04:34.030> feel

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:34.690 
is the season finale like I don't feel

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:36.720 
is the season finale like I don't feel
like<00:04:34.900> there's<00:04:35.110> anything<00:04:35.470> else<00:04:35.770> coming<00:04:36.280> after

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:36.730 
like there's anything else coming after

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:39.300 
like there's anything else coming after
this<00:04:36.910> like<00:04:37.480> episode<00:04:37.960> I<00:04:37.990> don't<00:04:38.590> think<00:04:38.800> I<00:04:38.980> think

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:39.310 
this like episode I don't think I think

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:41.490 
this like episode I don't think I think
they're<00:04:39.430> done<00:04:39.640> the<00:04:40.000> season<00:04:40.390> I<00:04:40.510> think<00:04:40.840> that's

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:41.500 
they're done the season I think that's

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:42.800 
they're done the season I think that's
how<00:04:41.620> I'm<00:04:41.710> looking<00:04:42.010> at<00:04:42.100> it<00:04:42.250> because<00:04:42.340> I<00:04:42.490> did<00:04:42.640> the

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:42.810 
how I'm looking at it because I did the

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:44.970 
how I'm looking at it because I did the
coronation<00:04:43.810> all<00:04:43.900> that<00:04:44.110> stuff<00:04:44.290> so<00:04:44.410> I<00:04:44.560> really

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:44.980 
coronation all that stuff so I really

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:46.980 
coronation all that stuff so I really
think<00:04:45.100> that's<00:04:45.310> what<00:04:45.460> they're<00:04:45.550> going<00:04:45.760> for<00:04:45.960> so<00:04:46.960> I

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:46.990 
think that's what they're going for so I

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:48.480 
think that's what they're going for so I
don't<00:04:47.200> feel<00:04:47.350> they're<00:04:47.530> like<00:04:47.860> there's<00:04:48.130> gonna<00:04:48.250> be

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:48.490 
don't feel they're like there's gonna be

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:49.680 
don't feel they're like there's gonna be
an<00:04:48.610> episode<00:04:48.940> that<00:04:48.970> comes<00:04:49.210> out<00:04:49.330> for<00:04:49.480> looks<00:04:49.600> like
