00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.050 
an unlimited energy glitch I haven't
seen<00:00:19.140> it<00:00:19.320> anywhere<00:00:19.470> else<00:00:19.890> on<00:00:20.070> youtube<00:00:20.460> i<00:00:20.699> think

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.060

i'm the founder but i'm not sure because
I've<00:00:23.130> been<00:00:23.160> really<00:00:24.230> researched<00:00:25.230> this<00:00:25.619> glitch

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
I've been really researched this glitch

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.540 
I've been really researched this glitch
at<00:00:26.130> all<00:00:26.480> but<00:00:27.480> so<00:00:27.779> you<00:00:28.410> just<00:00:28.619> go<00:00:28.800> into<00:00:29.070> a<00:00:29.099> battle

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:55.470 
and as you can see I only have three

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:59.990 
and as you can see I only have three
energy<00:00:55.890> and<00:00:56.070> all<00:00:56.190> of<00:00:56.340> them<00:00:57.740> so<00:00:58.740> yeah<00:00:59.670> just

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000 
energy and all of them so yeah just

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.750 
energy and all of them so yeah just
three<00:01:00.240> energy<00:01:00.630> and<00:01:00.780> all<00:01:00.870> them<00:01:01.050> so<00:01:01.860> now<00:01:02.160> you<00:01:02.220> go

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
and time or you go into general and then

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.820 
and time or you go into general and then
date<00:01:11.040> and<00:01:11.190> time<00:01:11.400> and<00:01:11.700> then<00:01:12.470> set<00:01:13.470> the<00:01:13.620> date<00:01:13.800> and

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
date and time and then set the date and

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.540 
date and time and then set the date and
time<00:01:14.040> and<00:01:14.220> then<00:01:14.610> set<00:01:14.910> it<00:01:14.940> like<00:01:15.150> an<00:01:15.390> hour<00:01:16.550> ahead

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:17.550 
time and then set it like an hour ahead

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:21.859 
time and then set it like an hour ahead
so<00:01:18.360> that<00:01:19.490> like<00:01:20.490> an<00:01:20.670> hour's<00:01:21.030> worth<00:01:21.210> of<00:01:21.360> energy

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
so that like an hour's worth of energy

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.370 
so that like an hour's worth of energy
is<00:01:22.050> done<00:01:22.610> or<00:01:23.610> now<00:01:24.270> every<00:01:24.540> worth<00:01:24.720> of<00:01:24.900> waiting<00:01:25.140> is

is done or now every worth of waiting is
done<00:01:25.590> and<00:01:25.830> then<00:01:25.979> you<00:01:26.250> can<00:01:26.400> just<00:01:26.550> go<00:01:26.700> back<00:01:26.729> into
