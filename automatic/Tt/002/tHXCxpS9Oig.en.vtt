 styrofoam construction bases 

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:07.000
 used in construction on 

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.040
 over the years it's ecologically 

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:10.420
 pure and toxic assets and 

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:12.080
 soundproof materials with low 

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:13.269
 thermal conductivity 

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:15.349
 vapor permeability expanded polystyrene it 

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:16.670
 material that does not emit any 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:18.210
 harmful substances are straining 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.529
 decomposition under the influence 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:21.230
 microorganisms without time limit 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:23.009
 shelf life does not support the process 

00:00:23.009 --> 00:00:23.869
 burning polystyrene foam 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:25.450
 good heat insulator 

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:26.800
 used as an average 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.349

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:35.130
 two meter brick style 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.629
 prospective equipment 

00:00:36.629 --> 00:00:38.190
 allows you to produce square Stolypin

 polystyrene weather 

00:00:39.569 --> 00:00:43.419
 15 588 86 and does not require special installation 

00:00:43.419 --> 00:00:45.319
 production is waste-free 

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:47.339

 production technology 

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:51.009
 the foam is divided into 

00:00:51.009 --> 00:00:53.340
 the next stage of depreciation 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:54.950
 and will carry out preliminary

 we are at the same time 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:17.189
 interesting for cutting the block but there are 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.009
 requires solutions designed table 

00:01:19.009 --> 00:01:21.159
 the blocks are just possible for the summer from as thick as 

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:22.770

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:29.270
 2 capacity 5 cubic meters per hour for 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:30.560
 increase performance in 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:31.600
