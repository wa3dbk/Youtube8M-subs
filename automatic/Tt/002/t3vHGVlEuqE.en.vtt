00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.380
 hello welcome to my channel 

00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:06.660
 as I had the card magic little set apart by stage magic 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:11.309
 well let's go back to the origins the flow of cosmography boys and girls 

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:12.049
 with 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:15.159
 red 

00:00:15.159 --> 00:00:17.240
 we will take the red deck 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:20.240
 the mixture we will do a little 

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:24.439
 therefore the pair of mixtures 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:31.009
 and we will give a spectator lesson a letter as 

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:33.680
 to the Hindu 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:34.620
 we'll go 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.710
 passing letters and when I do not have you for example over here 

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.010
 we will send you the letter 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.880
 we will recompose the deck 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.150
 we will make a cut 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:51.150
 i salt tote 

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:53.610
 done this 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:57.890
 we will see the spectator that by our magic we will return a letter 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:00.890
 we are a magical pass 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:04.280
 i have already turned a letter upside down 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.280
 we will be clearly taught 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.210
 the ruled out the turn 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.630
 we will remove the letter 

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:17.050
 the depositaries the edge of the table 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:19.010
 we will ask the viewer 

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:22.010
 was this your letter will logically tell us not to 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.270
 then we will go by let's do 

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:27.550
 another method to look for it 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:31.240
 you will stand and shuffle and with your magic pistol fire the alarms 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.240
 shot taken 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.650
 we will only have 

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.200
 what to turn around 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.110
 and look for your letter 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:45.110
 we will throw a bomb on the table 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:51.280
 until you examine your letter that we will clearly see that they have 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.480
 a shot 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:57.480
 in the middle 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.340
 i will continue to pester you to see 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.480
 his rests 

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:08.480
 this is exactly 

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:23.900
