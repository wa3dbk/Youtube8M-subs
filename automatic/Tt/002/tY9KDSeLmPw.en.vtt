them before we left but actually that
was<00:00:16.890> a<00:00:16.920> little<00:00:17.100> bit<00:00:17.310> of<00:00:17.400> a<00:00:17.430> problem<00:00:17.640> because

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:17.820 
was a little bit of a problem because

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.120 
was a little bit of a problem because
when<00:00:18.720> we<00:00:18.840> got<00:00:18.990> downstairs<00:00:19.350> to<00:00:19.740> the<00:00:19.770> bottom

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
when we got downstairs to the bottom

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.240 
when we got downstairs to the bottom
door<00:00:20.369> the<00:00:21.020> the<00:00:22.020> door<00:00:22.289> was<00:00:22.529> locked<00:00:22.560> from<00:00:23.039> the

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
door the the door was locked from the

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.040 
door the the door was locked from the
inside<00:00:23.369> like<00:00:24.119> the<00:00:24.240> front<00:00:24.539> door<00:00:24.750> of<00:00:24.900> the

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
inside like the front door of the

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:33.280 
inside like the front door of the
building<00:00:25.490> so<00:00:26.490> you<00:00:26.580> need<00:00:26.760> a<00:00:26.789> key<00:00:27.060> to<00:00:27.090> get<00:00:27.359> out

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:33.290 

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:35.510 

and<00:00:34.290> of<00:00:34.410> course<00:00:34.440> we<00:00:34.770> didn't<00:00:35.010> have<00:00:35.220> a<00:00:35.250> key

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
and of course we didn't have a key

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.729 
and of course we didn't have a key
because<00:00:36.060> we<00:00:36.390> left<00:00:36.600> both<00:00:36.780> sets<00:00:37.080> of<00:00:37.200> keys<00:00:37.260> in<00:00:37.620> the

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
because we left both sets of keys in the

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:39.620 
because we left both sets of keys in the
apartment<00:00:38.280> with<00:00:38.400> Karen<00:00:38.790> Chris<00:00:39.030> and<00:00:39.239> then<00:00:39.360> shut

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
the front door of the apartment so we

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.340 
the front door of the apartment so we
couldn't<00:00:42.600> get<00:00:42.720> out<00:00:42.900> of<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:43.260> apartment

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
couldn't get out of the apartment

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.250 
couldn't get out of the apartment
building<00:00:43.739> but<00:00:44.309> then<00:00:44.430> we<00:00:44.580> heard<00:00:44.790> some
