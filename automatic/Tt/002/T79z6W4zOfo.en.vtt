 and well this one is about how 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.969
 remove it on a michael server in 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.430
 measures server why because 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:47.550
 the server of main of the summit of the day 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:50.820
 said what you handle on the internet 

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:54.240
 it's a fault of not having optical and social 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:57.120
 why and well let's start 

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:59.220
 get a good solution to remove 

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:02.640
 to eliminate the lac forever and 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:05.100
 play very well because he remembered that 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.200
 are you walking from the games of the 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.630
 hungry for example after walking when 

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:13.259
 well excited inflation 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:17.009
 even killing people and the time comes in 

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:19.140
 which is for the bonus and after a 

00:01:17.009 --> 00:01:22.170
 ball that reacts and you're dead no 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.360
 no no no I do not allow that friends and then 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:27.899
 I looked for an exclusion and I found it 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.790
 and I have it for you and well we're going to 

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:31.960
 start 

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:34.510
 and they are going to remove 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.810
 let's start let's give first what 

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:40.079
 What I have to say is that 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.909
 a cable from the modem connected to the 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:45.060
 computer this serves so that the 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:52.320
 internet do not have anything else for you 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:54.899
 and right now nothing since giving 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:58.580
