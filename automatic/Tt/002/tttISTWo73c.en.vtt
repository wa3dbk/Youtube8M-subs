00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.159
 in an artificial intelligence about 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:04.159
 wheels 

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:10.450
 open door care when going up 

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:13.360
 please your base still alive and you will be greeted 

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:16.960
 by his private robotic companion 

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:19.539
 hello my name is a friendly co-pilot who is 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.990
 smart and helpful there are some 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:21.990
 steep slope 

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:36.510
 the goal is to create a new relationship 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:40.949
 between the human being and the car is a 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:43.260
 really futuristic car live is the 

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:46.170
 creation of masato inoue and his colleagues 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:49.320
 of nissan that bet on a future not 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:52.220
 only from super cars but also from 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:55.859
 kind robotic cars have come 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:58.770
 This robotic agent has two cameras 

00:00:55.859 --> 00:01:00.570
 in the eyes as a human being 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:02.359
 the interior cameras control and 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.129
 they analyze all their facial expressions 

00:01:02.359 --> 00:01:06.770
 so that alive he always knows how to 

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:09.679
 feel 

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:14.090
 it's sleepy it takes a long time 

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:16.490
 driving a cafeteria at 450 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.740
 meters but the virtues of pÃ­vot not 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:22.130
 limit to have a robot on board all the 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:24.110
 Car design is equally ingenious 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:26.030
 but it has wide doors for 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:27.920
 facilitate access to the cabin and 

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.409
 windshields and large openings for a 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.509
 better visibility and in case 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:33.860
 there would be some dead angle a set 

00:01:32.509 --> 00:01:35.780
 of cameras distributed by the 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:39.530
 body would facilitate a vision of 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:42.100
 360 degrees and alive not only sees in all 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:44.270
 directions broken in all directions 

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:47.000
 something that will change our current 

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:49.009
 driving concept on its chassis 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.260
 with four wheels has a cabin 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:54.780
 that rotates 360 degrees 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:56.080
 and how its four wheels can rotate 90 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.770
 degrees 

00:01:56.080 --> 00:02:01.720
 Parallel parking will not be a problem 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:05.010
 and the driver can always leave the 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.010
 car sidewalk 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.340
 thanks to his huge hands and his 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.430
 multiple live cameras is like 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:15.990
 visibility and transparency a car that 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.720
 It will make you feel connected to the world 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:20.610
 outside but and if the smart car 

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.160
 of the future will replace the windshield with 

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:25.290
 a computer screen is the audacious 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:28.740
 concept that proposes this phage back well 

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:31.080
 with your attend city car 

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:33.630
 as the name suggests the citycar 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:35.520
 is designed for urban life with a 

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.990
 lightweight chassis and the wheels arranged in 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.730
 diamond shape to optimize the 

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:40.850
 ability to maneuver in space 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.850
 reduced 

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:46.300
 but the most radical concept of the car 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:48.370
 It's your interior 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:50.410
 activating the city's intelligent mode 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:52.570
 car displays a digital display 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:55.690
 over the windshield so that you no longer 

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:57.520
 you will see through the glass but you will not 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:59.560
 worry they can see much better than 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:03.010
 before the road thanks to a system 

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:05.080
 that stefan calls augmented reality 

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:07.030
 the augmented reality consists of 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:10.510
 use technologies created to 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:12.040
 programs aimed at tanks and fighters the 

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:14.260
 basic concept is to give a 

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.540
 representation of reality superior to 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.640
 what we normally perceive in other 

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:19.990
 words his two eyes will not be able to compete 

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:22.510
 with the four infrared cameras 

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:24.250
 of the city card that allow you to see with 

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.020
 rain and at night much better than 

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:28.210
 would you see 

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:30.760
 Your display will alert you to the signals of 

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:34.230
 traffic and possible dangers and being a 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.230
 Digital display can be customized 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:38.170
 You can decide where to place the controls 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:40.180
 vehicle 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:41.920
 adjust the mirror to its angle 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.500
 view or place the speedometer more 

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.970
 up augmented reality will give you a 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:48.160
 windshield much more useful than 

00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:50.410
 usual glass like the 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:52.150
 pib or the citycar will also have cameras 

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:54.010
 inside and through a 

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:55.989
 retinal detector will confirm that the 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:58.120
 driving is your true owner and if 

00:03:55.989 --> 00:04:00.250
 the system does not recognize your eyes or those of 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:03.010
 some family the engine does not start and for 

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:04.390
 So much can not be stolen what those same 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:07.870
 cameras will make sure that the 

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:09.819
 driver is alert a camera 

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:11.680
 controls the movement of the eyes and 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:13.840
 emits a sound each time your eye 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:15.170
 left remains closed more than one 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:17.389
 second 

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:20.090
 with the cameras and sensors of the city card 

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:21.919
 your car will be safer and smarter and 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:24.500
 similar technologies can get 

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:26.990
 that the driving is smoother 

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:28.910
 in luxury cars the luxury 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:30.770
 it's not all and the lavish innovations 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:33.660
 Futurists will ensure that the vessel 

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:35.490
 follow half full 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:37.200
 the Mercedes engineers are 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:38.910
 developing a system to soften 

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:41.720
 the irregularities of the roads 

00:04:38.910 --> 00:04:45.950
 through a system called press can 

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:45.950
 We are paving the entire field 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.620
 infrared laser beams scan the 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:53.750
 road to detect bumps debris 

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:56.150
 or any irregularity at 10 meters 

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:57.740
 distance depending on what you see the 

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:00.050
 laser the system orders the suspension 

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:03.170
 relax or prepare for whatever comes 

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:06.210
 the result a smooth ride in 

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:08.370
 any type of conditions 

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:11.340
 Place a cup with water on the ceiling and 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:14.220
 will not spill a drop 

00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:16.500
 the Mercedes engineers call it the 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:19.230
 ride on magic carpet with the 

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:22.960
 radar sensors with sensors 

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:26.500
 the cameras we improve the amplitude 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:28.240
 to the depth of what we can see and 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:31.539
 perceive 

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:34.210
 and the best of all is that I will drive such 

00:05:31.539 --> 00:05:36.880
 how I like enjoying as much as possible 

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:40.770
 but with the full assurance that all 

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:40.770
 those sensors take care of me 

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:47.290
 your car of the future will be super 

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:47.290
 smart and super swan
