00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:25.650 
there and I think that's something being
dictated<00:05:23.530> by<00:05:23.860> the<00:05:23.919> field<00:05:24.490> position<00:05:25.030> but<00:05:25.539> you

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:25.660 
dictated by the field position but you

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:28.260 
dictated by the field position but you
see<00:05:25.900> what<00:05:26.110> Justin<00:05:26.650> don't<00:05:26.889> can<00:05:27.250> do<00:05:27.460> when<00:05:28.180> you

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:28.270 
see what Justin don't can do when you

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:30.300 
see what Justin don't can do when you
have<00:05:28.419> to<00:05:28.599> be<00:05:28.870> nine<00:05:29.080> yards<00:05:29.590> and<00:05:29.860> this<00:05:29.979> is<00:05:30.130> making
