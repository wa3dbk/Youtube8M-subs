the<00:00:08.849> review<00:00:09.090> is<00:00:09.210> gonna<00:00:09.360> be<00:00:09.480> this<00:00:09.690> and<00:00:11.570> most

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:12.570 
the review is gonna be this and most

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:14.030 
the review is gonna be this and most
people<00:00:12.809> will<00:00:12.929> probably<00:00:12.990> what<00:00:13.469> is<00:00:13.590> that<00:00:13.799> and

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040 
people will probably what is that and

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.359 
people will probably what is that and
and<00:00:14.790> what's<00:00:15.150> the<00:00:15.240> point<00:00:15.420> of<00:00:15.599> it<00:00:15.660> but<00:00:16.279> this<00:00:17.279> is

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
and what's the point of it but this is

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:18.830 
and what's the point of it but this is
probably<00:00:17.490> one<00:00:17.820> of<00:00:17.850> the<00:00:17.970> most<00:00:18.090> simple<00:00:18.480> things<00:00:18.690> I

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
probably one of the most simple things I

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.179 
probably one of the most simple things I
have<00:00:19.020> just<00:00:19.260> a<00:00:19.380> little<00:00:19.410> adapter<00:00:19.740> but<00:00:20.070> it's

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
have just a little adapter but it's

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:22.250 
have just a little adapter but it's
probably<00:00:20.369> one<00:00:20.580> of<00:00:20.609> the<00:00:20.730> most<00:00:20.850> useful<00:00:21.300> and<00:00:21.600> this

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
probably one of the most useful and this

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.300 
probably one of the most useful and this
is<00:00:22.500> a<00:00:22.680> micro<00:00:23.310> USB<00:00:23.340> OTG<00:00:24.000> two<00:00:24.840> USB<00:00:25.680> and<00:00:25.980> this<00:00:26.189> is

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
is a micro USB OTG two USB and this is

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.800 
is a micro USB OTG two USB and this is
only<00:00:26.460> 2.0<00:00:27.000> and<00:00:27.269> OTG<00:00:28.279> stands<00:00:29.279> for<00:00:29.460> on-the-go

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:29.810 
only 2.0 and OTG stands for on-the-go

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:32.179 
only 2.0 and OTG stands for on-the-go
and<00:00:30.810> the<00:00:31.380> reason<00:00:31.619> they<00:00:31.710> say<00:00:31.859> that<00:00:31.890> is<00:00:32.070> because

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
and the reason they say that is because

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:34.280 
and the reason they say that is because
it's<00:00:32.640> for<00:00:33.210> use<00:00:33.300> on<00:00:33.450> the<00:00:33.480> go<00:00:33.690> doesn't<00:00:33.960> require

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
it's for use on the go doesn't require

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.030 
it's for use on the go doesn't require
any<00:00:34.590> external<00:00:34.739> power<00:00:35.100> and<00:00:36.739> mainly<00:00:37.739> what<00:00:37.890> this

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:38.040 
any external power and mainly what this

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.369 
any external power and mainly what this
is<00:00:38.190> for<00:00:38.520> is<00:00:38.879> to<00:00:39.530> plug<00:00:40.530> into<00:00:40.770> your<00:00:41.010> phone<00:00:41.280> and

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
then you have a USB port and actually

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.580 
then you have a USB port and actually
the<00:00:48.210> majority<00:00:48.360> that<00:00:48.750> people<00:00:48.989> that<00:00:49.110> I<00:00:49.140> see<00:00:49.350> use

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
the majority that people that I see use

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.760 
the majority that people that I see use
these<00:00:49.800> online<00:00:50.070> or<00:00:50.640> even<00:00:51.149> in<00:00:51.239> person<00:00:51.270> is<00:00:51.840> they

these online or even in person is they
use<00:00:52.980> it<00:00:53.219> to<00:00:53.340> hook<00:00:53.430> up<00:00:53.640> some<00:00:53.969> sort<00:00:54.149> of<00:00:54.239> storage

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
use it to hook up some sort of storage

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.430 
use it to hook up some sort of storage

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:07.200 
gonna turn it so you guys can see what
I'm<00:02:05.710> doing<00:02:05.740> I<00:02:06.220> don't<00:02:06.790> know<00:02:06.850> if<00:02:06.940> you'll<00:02:07.030> be<00:02:07.150> able

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:07.210 
I'm doing I don't know if you'll be able

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:09.600 
I'm doing I don't know if you'll be able
to<00:02:07.390> see<00:02:07.600> this<00:02:07.810> but<00:02:08.619> as<00:02:08.740> I<00:02:08.860> move<00:02:09.039> the<00:02:09.190> controller

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:09.610 
to see this but as I move the controller

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:11.370 
to see this but as I move the controller
you<00:02:09.910> can<00:02:10.090> say<00:02:10.209> it<00:02:10.300> can<00:02:10.330> actually<00:02:10.600> use<00:02:11.110> it<00:02:11.260> to

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
you can say it can actually use it to

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:18.930 
you can say it can actually use it to
navigate<00:02:14.250> and<00:02:15.250> I<00:02:16.239> was<00:02:16.569> gonna<00:02:16.720> you<00:02:17.080> know<00:02:17.940> get

navigate and I was gonna you know get

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:20.430 
navigate and I was gonna you know get
all<00:02:19.090> this<00:02:19.209> queued<00:02:19.630> up<00:02:19.750> and<00:02:19.930> everything<00:02:20.230> but

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
all this queued up and everything but

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.710 
all this queued up and everything but
for<00:02:20.709> the<00:02:21.580> purpose<00:02:21.850> of<00:02:21.940> the<00:02:22.030> video<00:02:22.300> I'm<00:02:22.569> gonna

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
for the purpose of the video I'm gonna

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.240 
for the purpose of the video I'm gonna
do<00:02:22.900> this<00:02:22.989> all<00:02:23.140> in<00:02:23.170> real<00:02:23.380> time<00:02:23.590> so<00:02:23.830> you<00:02:23.860> guys<00:02:24.069> can

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:24.250 
do this all in real time so you guys can

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.340 
do this all in real time so you guys can
see<00:02:24.400> exactly<00:02:24.610> what<00:02:24.819> I'm<00:02:24.940> doing<00:02:25.090> and<00:02:25.420> then<00:02:26.260> I'll

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:26.350 
see exactly what I'm doing and then I'll

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:30.150 
see exactly what I'm doing and then I'll
zoom<00:02:26.500> in<00:02:26.620> for<00:02:26.830> you<00:02:26.980> so<00:02:27.930> as<00:02:28.930> I<00:02:29.140> was<00:02:29.260> saying<00:02:29.500> my<00:02:30.130> I

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
zoom in for you so as I was saying my I

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:31.860 
zoom in for you so as I was saying my I
bricked<00:02:30.730> my<00:02:30.910> old<00:02:31.030> phone<00:02:31.239> so<00:02:31.420> this<00:02:31.540> is<00:02:31.630> a<00:02:31.660> brand

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:31.870 
bricked my old phone so this is a brand

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:33.210 
bricked my old phone so this is a brand
new<00:02:31.900> once<00:02:32.140> you<00:02:32.230> only<00:02:32.350> have<00:02:32.500> a<00:02:32.530> couple<00:02:32.830> games<00:02:33.010> on

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
new once you only have a couple games on

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.000 
new once you only have a couple games on
it<00:02:33.630> but<00:02:34.630> and<00:02:34.870> actually<00:02:35.050> maybe<00:02:35.500> I<00:02:35.650> won't<00:02:35.860> sue

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.010 
it but and actually maybe I won't sue

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:37.860 
it but and actually maybe I won't sue
min<00:02:36.160> so<00:02:36.340> you<00:02:36.400> can<00:02:36.610> actually<00:02:36.730> see<00:02:37.150> that<00:02:37.750> I'm

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
min so you can actually see that I'm

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:42.290 
min so you can actually see that I'm
using<00:02:37.900> the<00:02:38.230> controller<00:02:39.780> so<00:02:40.800> let's<00:02:41.800> just<00:02:42.010> start

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:42.300 
using the controller so let's just start

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.360 
using the controller so let's just start
actually<00:02:43.300> maybe<00:02:43.600> you<00:02:43.660> have<00:02:43.780> to<00:02:43.870> do<00:02:44.019> it<00:02:44.250> and<00:02:45.250> so

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
actually maybe you have to do it and so

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.130 
actually maybe you have to do it and so
then<00:02:45.489> once<00:02:45.640> you<00:02:45.700> start<00:02:45.880> playing<00:02:46.140> and

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:47.140 
then once you start playing and

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:48.630 
then once you start playing and
obviously<00:02:47.530> I'm<00:02:47.680> playing<00:02:47.890> upside<00:02:48.190> down<00:02:48.340> for<00:02:48.550> my

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:48.640 
obviously I'm playing upside down for my

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.000 
obviously I'm playing upside down for my
point<00:02:48.880> of<00:02:48.970> view<00:02:49.120> but<00:02:49.350> just<00:02:50.350> so<00:02:50.470> you<00:02:50.530> guys<00:02:50.739> can

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
point of view but just so you guys can

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.809 
point of view but just so you guys can
see<00:02:52.500> I'm<00:02:53.500> actually<00:02:53.709> playing<00:02:54.130> and<00:02:54.459> actually

00:02:54.809 --> 00:02:54.819 
see I'm actually playing and actually

00:02:54.819 --> 00:03:00.360 
see I'm actually playing and actually
what<00:02:54.970> I'm<00:02:55.060> gonna<00:02:55.239> do<00:02:55.480> is<00:02:58.980> you<00:02:59.980> guys<00:03:00.130> know<00:03:00.340> I

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:00.370 
what I'm gonna do is you guys know I

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.009 
what I'm gonna do is you guys know I
don't<00:03:00.459> like<00:03:00.700> to<00:03:00.819> cue<00:03:01.060> up<00:03:01.090> my<00:03:01.330> crap<00:03:01.630> I<00:03:01.780> like<00:03:01.930> to

00:03:02.009 --> 00:03:02.019 
don't like to cue up my crap I like to

00:03:02.019 --> 00:03:04.770 
don't like to cue up my crap I like to
do<00:03:02.110> it<00:03:02.200> all<00:03:02.260> alive<00:03:02.560> so<00:03:02.950> bear<00:03:03.549> with<00:03:03.579> me<00:03:03.760> there<00:03:04.690> we

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
do it all alive so bear with me there we

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:13.330 
do it all alive so bear with me there we
go<00:03:04.930> that's<00:03:05.170> a<00:03:05.230> little<00:03:05.380> bit<00:03:05.500> better<00:03:05.590> view<00:03:07.380> so

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.290 

that's<00:03:14.340> pretty<00:03:14.490> much<00:03:14.610> how<00:03:14.670> it<00:03:14.790> works<00:03:14.910> you<00:03:15.120> just

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:15.300 
that's pretty much how it works you just

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.120 
that's pretty much how it works you just
play<00:03:15.480> like<00:03:15.840> if<00:03:15.990> you<00:03:16.110> were<00:03:16.260> playing<00:03:16.980> on<00:03:17.070> a

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
play like if you were playing on a

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:21.530 
play like if you were playing on a
console<00:03:18.380> or<00:03:19.380> xbox<00:03:19.890> specifically<00:03:20.540> because

00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:21.540 
console or xbox specifically because

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.520 
console or xbox specifically because
it's<00:03:21.870> an<00:03:21.960> Xbox<00:03:22.320> controller<00:03:23.030> so<00:03:24.030> anyway<00:03:24.530> that's

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
it's an Xbox controller so anyway that's

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:27.050 
it's an Xbox controller so anyway that's
one<00:03:25.800> of<00:03:25.950> the<00:03:26.010> things<00:03:26.220> you<00:03:26.310> can<00:03:26.460> do<00:03:26.580> with<00:03:26.730> it<00:03:26.880> is

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:27.060 
one of the things you can do with it is

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:29.960 
one of the things you can do with it is
play<00:03:27.690> native<00:03:28.290> games<00:03:28.530> the<00:03:29.370> other<00:03:29.550> thing<00:03:29.790> I<00:03:29.910> do

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:29.970 
play native games the other thing I do

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:35.180 
play native games the other thing I do
which<00:03:30.390> is<00:03:30.420> I<00:03:32.030> think<00:03:33.030> better<00:03:33.390> is<00:03:34.200> you<00:03:35.040> can

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:35.190 
which is I think better is you can

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:39.460 
which is I think better is you can
emulate<00:03:35.520> so<00:03:36.330> what<00:03:36.720> games<00:03:36.960> I<00:03:37.110> have<00:03:37.260> on<00:03:37.380> here<00:03:37.830> I

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470 
emulate so what games I have on here I

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:42.830 
emulate so what games I have on here I
have<00:03:40.470> a<00:03:40.500> gameboy<00:03:41.130> advance<00:03:41.460> emulator<00:03:41.700> and<00:03:42.270> I

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
have a gameboy advance emulator and I

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:48.280 
have a gameboy advance emulator and I
thought<00:03:43.140> I<00:03:43.200> had<00:03:43.650> I<00:03:45.320> just<00:03:46.320> have<00:03:46.590> contra<00:03:47.040> I<00:03:47.070> guess

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
thought I had I just have contra I guess

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:56.840 
thought I had I just have contra I guess
so<00:03:51.230> actually<00:03:52.230> let<00:03:52.350> me<00:03:52.380> do<00:03:52.530> this<00:03:55.460> as<00:03:56.460> I<00:03:56.580> said<00:03:56.820> I

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:56.850 
so actually let me do this as I said I

00:03:56.850 --> 00:03:58.490 
so actually let me do this as I said I
don't<00:03:57.000> like<00:03:57.150> to<00:03:57.390> queue<00:03:57.600> things<00:03:57.870> up<00:03:58.140> maybe<00:03:58.380> I

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
don't like to queue things up maybe I

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:03.770 
don't like to queue things up maybe I
should<00:03:58.830> but<00:03:59.100> whatever<00:03:59.370> I<00:04:02.330> just<00:04:03.330> want<00:04:03.630> to<00:04:03.690> make

00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:03.780 
should but whatever I just want to make

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:07.480 
should but whatever I just want to make
it<00:04:03.930> a<00:04:03.990> better<00:04:04.140> view<00:04:04.470> for<00:04:04.740> you<00:04:04.860> oh<00:04:05.990> there<00:04:06.990> we<00:04:07.050> go

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:07.490 
it a better view for you oh there we go

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:14.230 
it a better view for you oh there we go
so<00:04:08.490> rotated<00:04:09.150> it<00:04:09.270> and<00:04:10.080> then<00:04:11.900> play<00:04:12.900> contra<00:04:13.290> and

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:14.240 
so rotated it and then play contra and

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:15.940 
so rotated it and then play contra and
unfortunately<00:04:15.240> I<00:04:15.300> don't<00:04:15.450> know<00:04:15.630> the<00:04:15.750> buttons

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:15.950 
unfortunately I don't know the buttons

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:19.909 
unfortunately I don't know the buttons
but<00:04:16.950> as<00:04:17.310> you<00:04:17.489> can<00:04:17.609> see<00:04:18.290> you<00:04:19.290> can<00:04:19.440> use<00:04:19.470> any<00:04:19.709> sort

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919 
but as you can see you can use any sort

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:22.220 
but as you can see you can use any sort
of<00:04:20.040> emulator<00:04:20.489> or<00:04:20.640> in<00:04:21.359> any<00:04:21.510> sort<00:04:21.720> of<00:04:21.780> roms<00:04:22.020> you

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:22.230 
of emulator or in any sort of roms you
