 auxerre 39 points receives sochaux 42.2 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.509
 league historic club 1 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.980
 compete to find her precisely 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:18.359
 next season and this desire 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:22.490
 does not appear utopian at eleven days 

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:24.900
 of the end despite a tumultuous journey 

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:26.939
 the auxerrois remain on a victory 4 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:29.760
 goals 2 against arles-avignon and sochaux 

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:31.740
 also prevailed against towers 

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.450
 the Sochaux who show themselves 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:37.290
 enterprising at the beginning of the meeting 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:42.809
 thanks to karl toko ekambi who stumbles on 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:44.969
 a geoffrey lambert inspired a phase in 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:49.440
 two passes that puts the defense 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:50.969
 auxerroise to the torture toko ekambi who 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.039
 try to control this balloon 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:56.550
 properly there is a bad rebound 

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:58.859
 the ornament has subsequently prevented these are 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.050
 always they and Sochaux who will 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.090
 dangerous watch 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.320
 geoffrey lambert pushes the ball and 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:08.970
 the recovery that follows is not framed 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:12.299
 sochaux has the monopoly of the Sochaux balloon 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:14.040
 mastery but is driven to fault by 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:17.960
 Auxerrois laundry 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:22.020
 the goal is scored but denied for 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:25.280
 amara baby for an offside position 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:29.520
 an offside position 

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:33.000
 for the smugger amara baby and so 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:37.380
 unfairly deprived of the opening of the 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:39.270
 score we are a stone's throw away 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.590
 of the end of this first period 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.479
 a free kick caused by Frederic 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:46.399
 sammaritano it's hit by the foot 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:49.500
 left of Gregory Berthier is cut by 

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:51.540
 Sebastien Puygrenier Captain of 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.210
 the aja which rises higher than all the 

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:57.030
 world to register his third goal of 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:02:00.450
 the season and allow the age ago to 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.110
 lead yohann peeled remained stuck on 

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.119
 its supports 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:07.259
 the free kick is well shot well 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:08.899
 worked but the former nancéen and 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:11.510
 Monaco 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:13.060
 to experience is very strong about these 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:16.459
 phases of play 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:19.700
 despite its large size there valve peeled 

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:22.610
 could not relax and push back this 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.230
 head of sébastien puygrenier a goal to 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:25.370
 zero so for the chiasse is better 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.890
 in the first leg where both teams 

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:30.079
 had left on the score of 0 to 0 

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:31.549
 we were close to 2 to 0 thanks to this 

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:32.840
 good job of berthier it's thomas 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:34.760
 fountain that was mounted to the front 

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.680
 posts but he finds a peeled yohann 

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:38.900
 inspired at close range and they 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.739
 leave behind a new leg 

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:44.690
 opportunity for vannuchi men 

00:02:41.739 --> 00:02:47.900
 the equivocal balloon in the surface of 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:49.940
 peeled yohann repair and it takes a 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.129
 saving liberation of matheus vivian 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:53.720
 holder in the absence of lionel zuma and 

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:55.730
 of jean pascal mignot we stay there 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.439
 second consecutive victory for the ga 

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:59.420
 which comes down to six points on the podium and 

00:02:57.439 --> 00:03:00.950
 passes in front of the Sochaux to the benefit 

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:04.060
 a better goal difference and 

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:04.060
 lion cubs are seventh
