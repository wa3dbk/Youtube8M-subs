00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:40.080
 very welcome to scientist channel 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:42.510
 data 

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.199
 today we will analyze the depreciation of 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.570
 cars 

00:00:43.199 --> 00:00:48.149
 according to the fipe table with values 

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.940
 between 40 and 50 thousand reais 

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:54.390
 we chose six cars and is part of the 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:57.210
 list the citroen c3 1.5 with average value 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:00.449
 of 10 kilometers of 44 thousand reais 

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:03.000
 also has the 1.4 cobalt chevrolet with 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:06.479
 average value of 44 thousand reais 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.880
 fiat punto 1.4 attractive costing 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:13.200
 average 46 thousand reais 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:15.630
 It is part of the analysis the FDLR Rwanda x 1.4 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.200
 an average value of 46 thousand reais is zero 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.200
 kilometer 

00:01:18.349 --> 00:01:26.640
 the jac j3 1.4 costing an average of 41 thousand 

00:01:23.399 --> 00:01:29.880
 real and finally a fox 1.6 i motion 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:33.149
 with an average value of 41 thousand reais 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.020
 which of these cars - depreciates in two 

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:37.289
 years 

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:40.520
 The winner is the fitch ranking that 

00:01:37.289 --> 00:01:43.349
 depreciate for two years 16 percent 

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.209
 decreasing about seven thousand and 

00:01:43.349 --> 00:01:48.270
 six hundred reais 

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:51.420
 then comes the fox with almost 18 per 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.739
 cent devaluating about seven thousand and 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:57.479
 two hundred reais 

00:01:52.739 --> 00:02:00.599
 the next is the cube and jumps to 23% and 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:05.789
 depreciation decreasing by around 10,000 

00:02:00.599 --> 00:02:08.550
 real and closely followed by c3 with 23 

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:12.150
 percent dropping by about 10,000 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:15.030
 It is followed by real negative point 

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:18.050
 which loses 24 percent of its value 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:20.540
 original decreasing more than 11 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:24.020
 real estate with a strong 

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:27.800
 devaluation is the turn of j3 with almost 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:29.420
 32 percent depreciating about 13 thousand 

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:31.490
 real 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.800
 and if you spend four years with these 

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:37.040
 cars for sale 

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:40.760
 we will analyze the individual profile and the 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:44.690
 car that least value and the round feed 

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:48.500
 in one year of use it loses 10% in two 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:51.980
 years loses 16 percent in three years 

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:54.770
 goes to 21 percent and in four years 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:57.110
 rises to 27 percent 

00:02:54.770 --> 00:03:00.500
 we note that in two years he 

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:02.960
 16% and if you intend to 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:05.920
 buy one made in two years of use 

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:09.530
 over the next two years it will 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:11.870
 12.8 percent ie is a good choice 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:14.150
 for those who buy at 0 and it's a great 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.320
 choice for those who buy seminovo 12 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:20.090
 years of use 

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:23.420
 we will analyze the fox 1.6 in a year is 

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:24.080
 I only need 7% less until the sling 

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:27.020
 fit 

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:30.500
 however in two years it makes a leap to 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:35.840
 18th center in three years climbs lightly 

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:38.330
 to 22% and in four years goes to 29% 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.610
 if you compare a fox with two years of 

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:44.810
 use and spend another two years 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:47.480
 devaluation at 13.45 per cent in the 

00:03:44.810 --> 00:03:50.150
 which tells us that it is a good option both 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:53.480
 so that the Brazilian as a new 

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:55.190
 let's see the situation of c3 as a model 

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:58.459
 chosen is not four years old 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:04:02.239
 analyzed in three years in a year 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:05.750
 depreciates 19 percent in two years jumps 

00:04:02.239 --> 00:04:08.120
 to 23 percent in three years rises 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:09.860
 slightly to 26% 

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:12.590
 this shows us that the greater 

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:15.410
 devaluation is two years of use 

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:17.120
 we can not point as a bad option but 

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:18.320
 we also can not classify as 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:21.260
 best choice 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:24.680
 let's look at the point in a year now 

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:25.710
 depreciates 19 percent in two years 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:29.940
 to 25 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:33.360
 the center in three years goes to 33% and in 

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:35.430
 four years rises to 37% 

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:38.580
 if you buy a point with two years of use 

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:41.430
 and spend two more years depreciating the 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:43.410
 about 16,000 97% 

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:46.289
 this shows us that the model is a good 

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:46.949
 option to buy seminovo 12 years of 

00:04:46.289 --> 00:04:50.220
 use 

00:04:46.949 --> 00:04:54.360
 let's analyze the cube with the year depreciates 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:57.410
 strongly at 21% with two years 

00:04:54.360 --> 00:05:01.650
 slightly to 23 percent in three years 

00:04:57.410 --> 00:05:06.599
 rises a little more to 29% and in four 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:09.060
 years depreciates greatly going to 44% 

00:05:06.599 --> 00:05:13.199
 if you buy with two years of use and pass 

00:05:09.060 --> 00:05:15.509
 plus two will not lose 27.43 on average 

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:17.880
 this indicates that the body is not a 

00:05:15.509 --> 00:05:19.050
 good bit for zero kilometer 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:22.400
 while the new 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:25.889
 To conclude, let's look at the situation of j3 

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:28.940
 in one year strongly depreciated by 25 per 

00:05:25.889 --> 00:05:33.720
 one in two years goes to 32 percent 

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:36.270
 in three years rises to 40% and in four 

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:38.970
 years goes to 45% 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:41.880
 the variation for who buys j3 with 

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:46.139
 two years of use and spends another two years 

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:48.000
 is 19,26 we can conclude that with 

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:49.409
 Zero models rush is not 

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.500
 a good option 

00:05:49.409 --> 00:05:55.080
 two years of use is reasonable when 

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:57.320
 we analyze the depreciation in four years 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:06:00.930
 we saw that j3 was the most 

00:05:57.320 --> 00:06:02.639
 devalued however the coach stays with 

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:05.070
 a negative choice of the 

00:06:02.639 --> 00:06:08.039
 because it is the one that most devalued 

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:10.349
 for anyone who buys seminovo and the choice 

00:06:08.039 --> 00:06:13.469
 positive attitude of the data scientist goes to 

00:06:10.349 --> 00:06:15.750
 or the fitch round that devalues ​​27 per 

00:06:13.469 --> 00:06:18.060
 cent over four years and is one of the 

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:20.509
 good option for those who buy seminovo 12 

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:24.270
 years of use and according to the fipe table 

00:06:20.509 --> 00:06:25.919
 besides analyzing the motorization comfort 

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:27.990
 and maintenance cost 

00:06:25.919 --> 00:06:29.849
 we have seen how important it is to 

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:32.880
 depreciation of the vehicle we intend to 

00:06:29.849 --> 00:06:35.180
 acquire in the next video we will go 

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:38.210
 analyze cars with values ​​between them with 

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:40.460
 Five and eighty thousand reais you will see that 

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:41.990
 in this category you have to be willing to 

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:45.470
 lose much more money in the 

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:47.840
 depreciation liked the data scientist 

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:48.740
 channel and share with your 

00:06:47.840 --> 00:06:51.490
 friends 

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:51.490
 to the next
