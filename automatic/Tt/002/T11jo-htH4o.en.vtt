00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
actually not too I guess thrilled about

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.549 
actually not too I guess thrilled about
I<00:00:40.620> like<00:00:41.250> the<00:00:41.670> hard<00:00:42.000> shell<00:00:42.300> double<00:00:42.719> dip<00:00:42.870> this

00:00:43.549 --> 00:00:43.559 
I like the hard shell double dip this

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.209 
I like the hard shell double dip this
one<00:00:43.829> is<00:00:44.100> a<00:00:44.129> little<00:00:44.730> bit<00:00:45.680> not<00:00:46.680> really<00:00:46.950> hitting

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
one is a little bit not really hitting

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:48.979 
one is a little bit not really hitting
it<00:00:47.309> for<00:00:47.579> me<00:00:47.700> I<00:00:48.030> mean<00:00:48.180> it<00:00:48.270> because<00:00:48.510> it<00:00:48.629> just<00:00:48.780> it

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
it for me I mean it because it just it

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.350 
it for me I mean it because it just it
just<00:00:49.020> doesn't<00:00:49.350> really<00:00:49.379> feel<00:00:49.789> quality<00:00:50.789> wise<00:00:50.969> is

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
just doesn't really feel quality wise is

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.990 
just doesn't really feel quality wise is
nice<00:00:51.629> as<00:00:51.960> the<00:00:52.170> other<00:00:52.350> one<00:00:52.590> did<00:00:52.829> and<00:00:53.160> it<00:00:53.879> does

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
nice as the other one did and it does

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.069 
nice as the other one did and it does
have<00:00:54.180> a<00:00:54.210> little<00:00:54.329> more<00:00:54.510> functionality<00:00:55.050> than

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
have a little more functionality than

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.020 
have a little more functionality than
your<00:00:55.260> average<00:00:55.410> flip<00:00:55.980> case<00:00:56.190> traditionally

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
your average flip case traditionally

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.029 
your average flip case traditionally
like<00:00:57.149> on<00:00:57.270> your<00:00:57.390> Samsung<00:00:57.780> devices<00:00:58.140> it<00:00:58.859> just

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
like on your Samsung devices it just

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.010 
like on your Samsung devices it just
flips<00:00:59.219> open<00:00:59.340> like<00:00:59.609> that<00:00:59.640> but<00:01:00.030> this<00:01:00.149> one<00:01:00.449> has<00:01:00.660> a

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
flips open like that but this one has a

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.349 
flips open like that but this one has a
little<00:01:01.680> more<00:01:01.800> extra<00:01:02.399> flip<00:01:02.640> you<00:01:02.850> can<00:01:02.969> see<00:01:03.149> here

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
little more extra flip you can see here

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:07.219 
little more extra flip you can see here
it<00:01:03.480> opens<00:01:03.570> up<00:01:03.899> all<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:04.320> way<00:01:04.409> like<00:01:04.619> that<00:01:04.860> and<00:01:06.229> it

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
it opens up all the way like that and it

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.030 
it opens up all the way like that and it
allows<00:01:07.470> you<00:01:07.770> to<00:01:08.330> prop<00:01:09.330> up<00:01:09.540> the<00:01:09.750> device<00:01:10.020> to<00:01:10.619> give

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:11.040 
allows you to prop up the device to give

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:13.490 
allows you to prop up the device to give
it<00:01:11.159> almost<00:01:11.400> a<00:01:11.549> kickstand<00:01:11.939> like<00:01:12.210> a<00:01:12.659> little

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
it almost a kickstand like a little

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.530 
it almost a kickstand like a little
media<00:01:13.830> functionality<00:01:14.760> there<00:01:14.939> so<00:01:15.210> you<00:01:15.270> can

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:15.540 
media functionality there so you can

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.480 
media functionality there so you can
play<00:01:15.900> games<00:01:15.930> or<00:01:16.290> watch<00:01:16.439> movies<00:01:16.619> what<00:01:17.400> I'm

gonna play games but you could actually

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.570 
gonna play games but you could actually
watch<00:01:18.869> a<00:01:19.020> movie<00:01:19.290> or<00:01:19.320> YouTube<00:01:19.710> video<00:01:19.950> by

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040 
propping it up like so and spin it

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.010 
propping it up like so and spin it
around<00:01:23.220> there<00:01:23.580> for<00:01:23.610> you<00:01:23.939> get<00:01:24.450> a<00:01:24.479> good<00:01:24.659> look<00:01:24.720> at

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
around there for you get a good look at

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.580 
around there for you get a good look at
it<00:01:25.670> and<00:01:26.670> it's<00:01:27.000> pretty<00:01:27.420> nice<00:01:27.630> pretty<00:01:28.170> cool<00:01:28.380> I

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590

actually<00:01:28.740> liked<00:01:29.009> that<00:01:29.130> part<00:01:29.340> about<00:01:29.549> it<00:01:29.610> but

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
actually liked that part about it but

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.569 
actually liked that part about it but
overall<00:01:30.810> I<00:01:30.869> just<00:01:31.170> feel<00:01:31.380> like<00:01:31.500> it<00:01:31.770> feels<00:01:32.189> weird

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
overall I just feel like it feels weird

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:35.450 
overall I just feel like it feels weird
like<00:01:32.850> the<00:01:32.909> soft<00:01:33.240> touch<00:01:33.420> down<00:01:33.689> here<00:01:34.460> doesn't

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
like the soft touch down here doesn't

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.819 
like the soft touch down here doesn't
really<00:01:35.640> look<00:01:35.820> nice<00:01:36.509> and<00:01:36.840> chiseled<00:01:37.409> and<00:01:37.740> it

really look nice and chiseled and it

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.399 
really look nice and chiseled and it
leaves<00:01:38.130> little<00:01:38.340> marks<00:01:38.850> and<00:01:39.090> scrapings<00:01:39.720> and<00:01:40.079> it

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:40.409 
leaves little marks and scrapings and it

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:42.080 
leaves little marks and scrapings and it
has<00:01:40.560> a<00:01:40.590> nice<00:01:40.770> leather<00:01:41.070> touch<00:01:41.369> here<00:01:41.759> on<00:01:41.939> the

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:45.530 
has a nice leather touch here on the
back<00:01:42.560> but<00:01:43.560> it<00:01:44.399> just<00:01:44.460> feels<00:01:44.820> flimsy<00:01:45.030> when<00:01:45.450> you

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:45.540 
back but it just feels flimsy when you

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.030 
back but it just feels flimsy when you
open<00:01:45.869> it<00:01:45.990> mainly<00:01:46.320> because<00:01:46.560> it<00:01:46.860> has<00:01:47.009> that

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
open it mainly because it has that

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.719 
open it mainly because it has that
little<00:01:47.399> extra<00:01:47.670> flap<00:01:48.450> open<00:01:48.840> area<00:01:49.140> there<00:01:49.320> and<00:01:49.729> I

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
little extra flap open area there and I

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:53.450 
little extra flap open area there and I
don't<00:01:51.180> like<00:01:51.299> the<00:01:51.479> way<00:01:51.600> that<00:01:52.130> it<00:01:53.130> doesn't

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:53.460 
don't like the way that it doesn't

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.990 
don't like the way that it doesn't
actually<00:01:53.579> cover<00:01:54.450> go<00:01:55.020> all<00:01:55.259> the<00:01:55.350> way<00:01:55.380> over<00:01:56.000> the

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
actually cover go all the way over the

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.940 
actually cover go all the way over the
speaker<00:01:57.390> grills<00:01:57.659> it<00:01:58.290> might<00:01:58.500> be<00:01:58.590> hard<00:01:58.770> to<00:01:58.799> see

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
speaker grills it might be hard to see

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.450 
speaker grills it might be hard to see
it<00:01:59.009> on<00:01:59.040> camera<00:01:59.219> but<00:01:59.880> it<00:02:00.329> doesn't<00:02:00.930> and<00:02:01.170> it<00:02:02.009> if

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
it on camera but it doesn't and it if

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:03.709 
it on camera but it doesn't and it if
you<00:02:02.610> just<00:02:02.640> give<00:02:02.939> it<00:02:03.060> a<00:02:03.149> little<00:02:03.299> bit<00:02:03.450> of<00:02:03.540> prep

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:03.719 
you just give it a little bit of prep

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:05.120 
you just give it a little bit of prep
not<00:02:03.930> even<00:02:04.110> pressure<00:02:04.290> but<00:02:04.619> you<00:02:04.710> can<00:02:04.829> see<00:02:04.950> here

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
not even pressure but you can see here

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.160 
not even pressure but you can see here
just<00:02:05.369> kind<00:02:05.579> of<00:02:05.670> I'm<00:02:06.420> hardly<00:02:06.689> doing<00:02:06.840> anything

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
just kind of I'm hardly doing anything

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.990 
just kind of I'm hardly doing anything
and<00:02:07.530> it's<00:02:07.619> already<00:02:07.920> kind<00:02:08.190> of<00:02:08.250> slipping<00:02:08.819> off

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:09.000 
and it's already kind of slipping off

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:09.930 
and it's already kind of slipping off
there

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:09.940 
there

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.990 
there
on<00:02:10.270> all<00:02:10.540> sides<00:02:10.869> so<00:02:11.320> it<00:02:11.620> seems<00:02:12.310> like<00:02:12.490> it's<00:02:12.730> just

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
on all sides so it seems like it's just

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.790 
on all sides so it seems like it's just
barely<00:02:13.390> holding<00:02:13.960> on<00:02:14.050> I<00:02:14.290> mean<00:02:14.440> it<00:02:14.530> really<00:02:14.680> is

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
barely holding on I mean it really is

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.710 
barely holding on I mean it really is
you<00:02:15.100> can<00:02:15.370> just<00:02:15.640> pop<00:02:15.820> your<00:02:15.850> device<00:02:16.210> out<00:02:16.450> like
