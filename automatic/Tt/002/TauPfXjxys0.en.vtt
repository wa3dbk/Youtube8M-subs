00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.549
 questions in front of the camera because 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.619

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:05.090
 do not evaporate so much alcohol and if not 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:10.770
 where the ship 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:13.560
 and they add only really when a wine 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:15.720
 or a cognac or a brandy to a recipe with 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.660
 it's hot the only thing we do is 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.260
 that the alcohol evaporates and the 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:24.810
 burn 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:29.819

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:04.740

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:06.750

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:11.430
 our classic Mexican chocolate 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:13.020
 granny chocolate that is a chocolate 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.440
 with cane we made known to the 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:18.210
 world what it is cocoa cocoa 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:21.000

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:22.860
 sadness if it is a sadness that in others 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.860
 countries 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:26.940
 process it we also have a 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:29.220
 little fat 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:31.200
 it does not matter we know that we are 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.300
 ready and now if what we're going to do 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.770
 is to fill the molds of these likes 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:36.120
 our furniture that can surely 

00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:38.370
 meet in the market we are at 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.690
 our from the mine my mom what they 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:41.460
 explained a little while ago is that it is very 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:42.990
 important to put a newspaper or a 

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:44.880
 piece of paper on the bottom so that 

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:46.770
 so they do not have movement for that 

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.740
 it is this challenge that releases the 

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:52.380
 review if you do not have something that 

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:54.030
 you help them think to move or 

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:56.340
 that instead with this good this is more 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:58.170
 heavy heavier ok I have to go to 

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:00.810
