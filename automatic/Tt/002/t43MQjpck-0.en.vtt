00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.870
 just 

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:10.280

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.450
 I can not go advent and there 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:13.160
 to throw mean spells around me 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:16.280
 dominate me today and at the same time 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:18.729
 helps me with chocolate chocolate 

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.729
 Orange taste 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:47.900

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:58.280
 her coffee chocolate roasted almonds 

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:59.720
 and some butter lentils alex are there 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.920
 but sometimes you can now fantasize 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.870
 are not that big of the gamescom 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.620
 but he is as small as lead or something 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:06.110
 sometimes do it 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:07.820
 until then you know honestly 

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:09.950
 I have been in the past very often 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:12.170
 I want to meet him and I always have 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:13.280
 still like to meet or to such a meeting 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:14.690
 such meetings 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.959
 the problem was that he was in the 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:20.450
 past uni and youtube are 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:22.489
 incidentally, very difficult to combine 

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.020
 and that's why they stayed extra 

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:27.410
 organized small television meeting 

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:28.580

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:30.290
 I am doing well directional statements 

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.450
 meanwhile this means for me 

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.220
 also a bit more time then left 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.680
 stay and then we can too 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:39.500
 together such little fantasies 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.030
 somewhere stupid at mc or burger 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.370

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.239

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.980

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.940
 and then let's see where we might be in 

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:54.769
 the next days respectively 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.450

 Animate is not really my prayer 

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:54.080
 I'm not up to date 

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:55.300

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:57.800
 from my blog 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:58.280
 Honestly that's a funny one 

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:00.710
 idea 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:02.690

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:06.320

00:05:56.370 --> 00:06:00.780
