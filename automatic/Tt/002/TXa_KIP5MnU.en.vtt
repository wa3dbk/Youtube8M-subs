other<00:00:13.679> words<00:00:13.920> let's<00:00:14.309> say<00:00:14.670> you've<00:00:15.210> purchased<00:00:15.719> a

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
other words let's say you've purchased a

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.230 
other words let's say you've purchased a
template<00:00:16.500> you've<00:00:16.800> downloaded<00:00:17.160> that<00:00:17.670> template

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:18.240 
template you've downloaded that template

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:21.080 
template you've downloaded that template
and<00:00:18.590> it<00:00:19.590> usually<00:00:19.980> comes<00:00:20.130> in<00:00:20.340> a<00:00:20.430> zipped<00:00:20.670> folder

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
and it usually comes in a zipped folder

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.480 
and it usually comes in a zipped folder
so<00:00:21.240> you<00:00:21.270> have<00:00:21.570> to<00:00:21.720> extract<00:00:22.320> the<00:00:22.529> contents<00:00:22.560> of

so you have to extract the contents of
the<00:00:24.060> zipped<00:00:24.960> folder<00:00:25.170> and<00:00:25.650> now<00:00:26.490> you<00:00:26.550> have<00:00:26.939> just

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
the zipped folder and now you have just

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.599 
the zipped folder and now you have just
a<00:00:27.330> folder<00:00:27.750> that<00:00:28.170> has<00:00:28.529> your<00:00:28.769> template<00:00:29.340> in<00:00:29.460> it

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
expression web 4 and there's a page

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.200 
expression web 4 and there's a page
there<00:00:58.859> by<00:00:59.039> default<00:00:59.100> so<00:00:59.699> I'll<00:00:59.789> just<00:00:59.910> close<00:01:00.149> that
