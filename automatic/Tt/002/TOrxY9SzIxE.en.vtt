00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:10.260
 Today is the protoleaf channel 

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:15.450
 This section describes the way of the water using a soil called Seramisu today 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:19.529
 I'm a store, but unlike Hydroball, this seller's store is 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.610
 There is a power to add water to each grain 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:25.620
 In such the 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:30.570
 It's like a hydroball, and managing it with a reservoir of water makes it a little bit of work and becomes rotten 

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:31.350
 As this watering will throw away extra water, it will be easier to cause 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.290
 It is referred to 

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:35.590
 It's important 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:37.280
 Time is actually going 

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:41.500
 Once 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.500
 Another hurts the sky comfortably water it in material 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:52.250
 Because if you do well, all shares will be included without seeing 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:56.380
 It is being organs at the time of this to turn off the water in the state in which I put a 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.380
 I'm waking up to the delay when I guess 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:12.760
 Yes you will see this 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:18.100
 Please be sure to give me this extra festival 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:24.400
 That these glass boots I've been asked to quite difficult and is the guy other than but 

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:25.510
 This surface is as the timing to raise it to the basics, so I'll give it back so completely 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.460
 Please be so 

00:01:25.510 --> 00:01:31.540
 This is also the same, and a lot of water 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.540
 Have you bald 

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:41.830
 Please give be in the water in the same way as before and you congratulation from to suit the grab 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:46.210
 Or rather float condition is not known, unlike glass 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:51.850
 There is an indicator like this because you can look at the surface of the board, so this 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:53.330
 If the color is light-dried it will turn red, so it will be water 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:57.730
 There is a timing to raise 

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.730
 I think all right kana and also you could use the this kind of goods
