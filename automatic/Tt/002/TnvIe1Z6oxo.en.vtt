00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:09.390
 on 2 in the Emirates test match against 

00:00:07.229 --> 00:00:11.550
 multiple uzbek champion will 

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:13.950
 bark dan petrescu exposed the composition almost 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:16.109
 identical to that completed previous 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:18.780
 fight sbrendil with kokorina we positions 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.760
 pure forward new and soup in the role 

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:23.580
 central midfielders with Ivanovo and 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.680
 to themselves on the flanks for me as well as three 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.420
 I had n't played a whole day before 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.789
 habitual role of drawn 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.619
 forward olo sword Berezovsky opposite 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.899
 returned to familiar positions 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:35.760
 thus the line of defense in the presence of 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:38.840
 Wilkshire and two central sambo and 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:40.380
 grenade acquired familiar outlines 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.360
 demonstrated from the first minutes 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:44.100
 good team movement Dynamo 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.079
 not even including the maximum speed 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.090
 looked better than the opponent 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.969
 left much to be desired only 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.890
 the final stage of the attack but at this 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:55.040
 time is more important to the coaching staff 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.030
 evaluation of the functional state of players 

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.920
 full command training 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.079
 interaction petrescu starts cooking 

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.059
 their charges in the next collection 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.440
 nevertheless, now the contour 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.430
 constructive game at times 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.650
 viewed 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:10.260
 very clearly in the brightest 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.360
 episode of the first half Yusupov unfolded 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.740
 gave a pity to Karina for giving 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:15.780
 moment at the gate brandt 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.060
 alexander cool left in central 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:20.610
 defenders and had a graceful throw 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:22.830
 the ball through the jumped goalkeeper to 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:24.869
 sorry for the dynamo is a bit inaccurate 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.460
 continuing on duty to wield the sword and 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:28.080
 territory financially however 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.909
 quite rarely managed to hide quite 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:32.250
 imagine a well-off defense uzbeks and 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:33.930
 teams play some work under 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:36.240
 management of the lava exchange Kasimov 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.369
 can boast a solid performance 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.229
 internationally closer to the break 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.180
 Asian Champions League semi finalist 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.040
 began to aggressively try on the gate 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.659
 Berezovsky and under the present 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.340
 I had to work hard at the gate 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:49.829
 appeared in the frame in the second half 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.720
 Frolova for which the debut at the charges 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:55.560
 two years ago is not the most pleasant 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:57.380
 remembered two years ago 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.719
 damn it 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:02.149
 and a little bit went wrong after that 

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:05.240
 the moment the game is now the opposite 

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:10.060
 It turned out and thank God it went better 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:12.650
 so I hope that in the future they will 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:15.290
 change a little bit of course for the better 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:17.630
 side this time I did not frolov 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.890
 the hero of the second half 2 him with his 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:20.269
 some short term 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:21.769
 connivance of defenders 

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:23.810
 accompanied by applause 

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:25.550
 Dynamo spare justice sake 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:26.569
 It is worth noting that in the composition in the second 

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.519
 half changed everything 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:30.590
 and the field appeared youth so this 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:32.769
 previously, and especially bear had to make 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:35.180
 a lot of effort in organizing defense 

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:37.010
 acting in the midfield yakubi 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.810
 while on viewing but this is the case 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.299
 hitting the player team rather on 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:43.519
 I play the perspective in my content 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:45.620
 in the second half did not leave holistic 

00:02:43.519 --> 00:02:47.870
 impression aggressive on the flanks she 

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.160
 was only occasionally so rare and 

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:51.110
 interaction of tashayev 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.780
 and howling yesterday led to the island lumbago 

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:55.940
 in the penalty area where the defenders burned write 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:58.010
 point-blank kurana because aches to that 

00:02:55.940 --> 00:03:00.709
 moment already replaced the ball came up a little 

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:03.079
 noticeable in the game jujak wenders points 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:05.359
 it seemed to hit for sure but ultimately pleased 

00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:07.190
 at bar 0 equality lasted until 

00:03:05.359 --> 00:03:09.019
 final referee whistle by giving 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:10.280
 for the next few days coaching 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:14.500
 headquarters and dynamo fans 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.500
 a lot of interesting topics for discussion 

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:23.049
 synth and forth in decline and sweat the place 

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:27.829
 Author savanchuku engine read what 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:32.400
 I get to Narvion Norm while you're there for him 

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:37.049
 learning from sea problems hit 

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:40.560
 pure Tatars are smeared compared to ours 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:45.299
 rival we are lagging behind in preparation and 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:48.950
 Exactly for a month the first half was better with 

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:50.909
 our side in the second was a bit like 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:53.390
 have work to do 

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:58.650
 there is something to think about a lot of young people 

00:03:53.390 --> 00:04:02.150
 which I also played, that is, in general, I 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:02.150
 satisfied with the movement
