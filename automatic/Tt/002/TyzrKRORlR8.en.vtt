only see those cleaner stays but it does

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.230

done<00:03:01.360> on<00:03:01.750> this<00:03:01.959> frame<00:03:02.230> we<00:03:02.770> have<00:03:02.800> just<00:03:03.250> super

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:03.730 
done on this frame we have just super

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:07.770 
done on this frame we have just super
super<00:03:04.230> stout<00:03:05.230> and<00:03:05.530> beefy<00:03:06.450> chainstays<00:03:07.450> and

super stout and beefy chainstays and

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.650 
super stout and beefy chainstays and
they<00:03:08.320> basically<00:03:08.620> transfer<00:03:09.340> the<00:03:09.459> power<00:03:09.670> so

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:10.660 
they basically transfer the power so

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:14.310 
they basically transfer the power so
well<00:03:10.959> this<00:03:11.620> is<00:03:11.800> a<00:03:11.950> rear<00:03:12.430> end<00:03:12.580> that's<00:03:12.820> a<00:03:13.050> 415<00:03:14.050> on

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:14.320 
well this is a rear end that's a 415 on

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.890 
well this is a rear end that's a 415 on
the<00:03:14.920> chainstay<00:03:15.310> length<00:03:15.700> and<00:03:16.060> that

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
the chainstay length and that

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.270 
the chainstay length and that
combination<00:03:17.320> can<00:03:17.680> have<00:03:17.800> a<00:03:17.860> little<00:03:18.070> bit

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:18.280 
combination can have a little bit

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.640 
combination can have a little bit
tighter<00:03:18.489> rear<00:03:18.790> and<00:03:19.000> with<00:03:19.570> those<00:03:19.959> chain<00:03:20.350> stays

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:20.650 
tighter rear and with those chain stays

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.100 
tighter rear and with those chain stays
that<00:03:20.980> are<00:03:21.130> so<00:03:21.459> thick<00:03:21.820> and<00:03:21.970> beefy<00:03:22.330> mean<00:03:22.930> that

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:23.110 
that are so thick and beefy mean that

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:25.080 
that are so thick and beefy mean that
when<00:03:23.500> you<00:03:23.620> jump<00:03:23.890> out<00:03:24.070> of<00:03:24.100> everything<00:03:24.550> every

cyclocross races are nothing but lots of

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.520 
cyclocross races are nothing but lots of

cornering and accelerating out of those
corners<00:03:32.800> is<00:03:33.040> very<00:03:33.310> important<00:03:33.820> and<00:03:33.970> and<00:03:34.510> this

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:34.720 
corners is very important and and this

your<00:03:57.700> bottom<00:03:58.000> bracket<00:03:58.120> so<00:03:59.160> redline<00:04:00.160> was<00:04:00.310> the

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:00.400 
your bottom bracket so redline was the

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:01.920 
your bottom bracket so redline was the
first<00:04:00.640> to<00:04:00.790> lower<00:04:00.970> the<00:04:01.180> bottom<00:04:01.450> bracket<00:04:01.540> height
