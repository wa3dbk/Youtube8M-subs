00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:22.020 
for those sort of even Super Mario Kart

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:23.480 
for those sort of even Super Mario Kart
and<00:00:22.320> are<00:00:22.439> looking<00:00:22.710> for<00:00:22.859> something<00:00:23.039> harder

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:23.490 
and are looking for something harder

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.929 
and are looking for something harder
it's<00:00:23.640> a<00:00:23.699> very<00:00:23.910> difficult<00:00:24.150> game<00:00:24.680> and<00:00:25.820> even<00:00:26.820> this

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
it's a very difficult game and even this

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.750 
it's a very difficult game and even this
first<00:00:27.240> course<00:00:27.599> is<00:00:27.840> not<00:00:28.740> very<00:00:28.769> easy<00:00:29.429> you'd

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
first course is not very easy you'd

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.709 
first course is not very easy you'd
think<00:00:29.970> that<00:00:30.210> the<00:00:30.449> very<00:00:30.720> shallow<00:00:31.560> curves<00:00:32.040> would

00:00:32.709 --> 00:00:32.719 
think that the very shallow curves would

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:35.660 
think that the very shallow curves would
make<00:00:33.719> it<00:00:33.899> a<00:00:34.079> rather<00:00:34.559> easy<00:00:34.829> course<00:00:35.160> to<00:00:35.280> navigate

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
make it a rather easy course to navigate

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.250 
make it a rather easy course to navigate
but<00:00:35.820> actually<00:00:36.360> there's<00:00:36.540> nothing<00:00:36.719> in<00:00:37.110> the

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:37.260 
but actually there's nothing in the

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.840 
but actually there's nothing in the
original<00:00:37.590> Super<00:00:37.739> Mario<00:00:38.040> Kart<00:00:38.129> quite<00:00:38.610> that

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
original Super Mario Kart quite that

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.850 
original Super Mario Kart quite that
long<00:00:39.090> and<00:00:39.329> shallow<00:00:41.300> so<00:00:42.300> it's<00:00:43.200> a<00:00:43.530> little<00:00:43.680> bit

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
long and shallow so it's a little bit

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.520 
long and shallow so it's a little bit
unfamiliar<00:00:44.370> and<00:00:44.730> also<00:00:45.210> the<00:00:45.809> cards<00:00:46.140> turns

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:46.530 
unfamiliar and also the cards turns

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:48.319 
unfamiliar and also the cards turns
aren't<00:00:46.800> quite<00:00:47.070> built<00:00:47.370> for<00:00:47.670> that<00:00:47.789> this<00:00:48.090> type<00:00:48.300> of

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:50.730 
term you see I'm good I have to make a

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:52.880 
term you see I'm good I have to make a
lot<00:00:50.969> of<00:00:51.090> sort<00:00:51.270> of<00:00:51.360> starts<00:00:51.930> of<00:00:52.140> drifts<00:00:52.590> to<00:00:52.770> be

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
lot of sort of starts of drifts to be

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.139 
lot of sort of starts of drifts to be
able<00:00:53.039> to<00:00:53.100> navigate<00:00:53.460> that<00:00:53.670> properly<00:00:55.940> it<00:00:56.940> allows

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
able to navigate that properly it allows

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.170 
able to navigate that properly it allows
me<00:00:57.300> to<00:00:57.329> keep<00:00:57.539> at<00:00:57.690> high<00:00:57.840> speed<00:00:58.289> but<00:00:59.010> I<00:00:59.250> don't<00:00:59.820> I'm

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
me to keep at high speed but I don't I'm

me to keep at high speed but I don't I'm
unable<00:01:00.480> to<00:01:00.570> drift<00:01:00.899> long<00:01:01.109> enough<00:01:01.440> to<00:01:02.309> get<00:01:02.460> to

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:02.520 
unable to drift long enough to get to

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.729 
unable to drift long enough to get to
full<00:01:02.699> speed<00:01:02.879> boost<00:01:03.290> and<00:01:04.290> if<00:01:04.559> you're<00:01:04.650> gonna

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
full speed boost and if you're gonna

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
speed speed-boosting item such as a

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.420 
speed speed-boosting item such as a
mushroom<00:01:07.080> or<00:01:07.200> star<00:01:07.470> you<00:01:07.590> can<00:01:07.710> use<00:01:07.860> it<00:01:07.979> as<00:01:08.100> I<00:01:08.220> did

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
mushroom or star you can use it as I did

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.270 
mushroom or star you can use it as I did
there<00:01:08.670> to<00:01:09.570> make<00:01:10.409> a<00:01:10.439> little<00:01:10.740> shortcut<00:01:11.010> across

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
there to make a little shortcut across

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:19.070 
there to make a little shortcut across
the<00:01:11.930> sandy<00:01:12.930> parts<00:01:13.200> of<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.409> track<00:01:18.080> don't

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
the sandy parts of the track don't

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.780 
the sandy parts of the track don't
notice<00:01:19.409> too<00:01:19.650> that<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:20.040> track<00:01:20.280> is<00:01:20.310> shaped<00:01:20.670> like

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
notice too that the track is shaped like

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.060 
notice too that the track is shaped like
a<00:01:20.939> mushroom<00:01:21.360> it's<00:01:22.140> a<00:01:22.259> nice<00:01:22.409> little<00:01:22.619> gimmick

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
a mushroom it's a nice little gimmick

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.710 
a mushroom it's a nice little gimmick
but<00:01:23.189> it's<00:01:23.369> actually<00:01:23.790> a<00:01:23.850> fun<00:01:24.060> course<00:01:24.330> to<00:01:24.570> race

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
but it's actually a fun course to race

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.200 
but it's actually a fun course to race
on<00:01:24.990> this<00:01:25.530> this<00:01:25.950> romhack<00:01:26.250> is<00:01:26.610> very<00:01:26.850> good<00:01:27.090> it

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
on this this romhack is very good it

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.490 
on this this romhack is very good it
doesn't<00:01:27.390> rely<00:01:28.170> on<00:01:28.200> gimmicks<00:01:28.979> such<00:01:29.460> as<00:01:29.670> sort<00:01:30.270> of

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
doesn't rely on gimmicks such as sort of

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.399 
doesn't rely on gimmicks such as sort of
excessive<00:01:31.500> jumps<00:01:31.890> or<00:01:32.750> tracks<00:01:33.750> being<00:01:34.049> shaped

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
excessive jumps or tracks being shaped

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:37.370 
excessive jumps or tracks being shaped
like<00:01:34.680> certain<00:01:35.670> things<00:01:35.909> it's<00:01:36.150> just<00:01:36.380> it

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:37.380 
like certain things it's just it

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.590 
like certain things it's just it
provides<00:01:37.680> very<00:01:37.920> good<00:01:38.009> racing<00:01:38.520> now<00:01:39.450> this

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
provides very good racing now this

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.270 
provides very good racing now this
course<00:01:39.930> provides<00:01:40.229> a<00:01:40.680> few<00:01:41.390> Forks<00:01:42.390> in<00:01:42.509> the<00:01:42.540> road

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 
course provides a few Forks in the road

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.039 
course provides a few Forks in the road
and<00:01:44.280> if<00:01:44.430> I<00:01:44.520> decided<00:01:45.030> to<00:01:45.180> go<00:01:45.329> to<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.600> to<00:01:45.960> the

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:46.049 
and if I decided to go to the to the

00:01:46.049 --> 00:01:48.590 
and if I decided to go to the to the
right<00:01:46.200> of<00:01:46.409> this<00:01:46.560> fork<00:01:46.979> I'll<00:01:47.640> be<00:01:47.880> able<00:01:47.970> to<00:01:48.090> get

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
right of this fork I'll be able to get

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.270 
right of this fork I'll be able to get
some<00:01:48.840> items<00:01:49.020> and<00:01:49.409> like<00:01:50.220> what<00:01:50.460> is<00:01:50.549> there<00:01:52.220> but<00:01:53.220> I

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
some items and like what is there but I

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.160 
some items and like what is there but I
recommend<00:01:53.759> just<00:01:53.820> staying<00:01:54.329> on<00:01:54.509> the<00:01:54.659> inside<00:01:54.990> as

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
recommend just staying on the inside as

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:57.469 
recommend just staying on the inside as
much<00:01:55.200> as<00:01:55.380> possible<00:01:55.880> because<00:01:56.880> it's<00:01:57.180> quite<00:01:57.450> a

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
much as possible because it's quite a

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.830 
much as possible because it's quite a
bit<00:01:57.659> faster<00:01:58.280> now<00:01:59.280> the<00:01:59.340> trick<00:01:59.640> here<00:01:59.909> is<00:01:59.939> being

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:00.840 
bit faster now the trick here is being

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.500 
bit faster now the trick here is being
able<00:02:00.960> to<00:02:01.049> take<00:02:01.259> those<00:02:02.100> very

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:03.510 
able to take those very

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:05.570

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
speed and I have to drift in and

speed and I have to drift in and
immediately<00:02:07.530> drift<00:02:07.980> back<00:02:08.220> and<00:02:08.490> space<00:02:08.700> myself

immediately drift back and space myself
right<00:02:09.300> and<00:02:09.510> there<00:02:09.690> I<00:02:09.720> messed<00:02:09.990> up<00:02:10.200> a<00:02:10.320> little<00:02:10.500> bit

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
right and there I messed up a little bit

right and there I messed up a little bit
fortunately<00:02:12.030> I<00:02:12.060> did<00:02:12.330> well<00:02:12.480> enough<00:02:12.510> in<00:02:12.900> the

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
fortunately I did well enough in the

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:16.490 
fortunately I did well enough in the
first<00:02:13.170> few<00:02:13.500> laps<00:02:13.650> so<00:02:13.980> that<00:02:14.130> I<00:02:14.690> am<00:02:15.690> still<00:02:16.380> in

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
first few laps so that I am still in

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.360 
first few laps so that I am still in
first<00:02:16.650> place<00:02:16.830> here<00:02:18.320> but<00:02:19.320> in<00:02:19.560> general<00:02:20.100> in<00:02:20.220> this

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:20.370 
first place here but in general in this

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:22.130 
first place here but in general in this
game<00:02:20.640> I<00:02:20.790> have<00:02:20.940> to<00:02:21.060> race<00:02:21.210> a<00:02:21.240> lot<00:02:21.540> more<00:02:21.780> precisely

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
game I have to race a lot more precisely

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.050 
game I have to race a lot more precisely
because<00:02:22.440> the<00:02:22.680> computer<00:02:23.070> AI<00:02:23.220> is<00:02:23.610> much<00:02:23.790> more

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
because the computer AI is much more

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:25.910 
because the computer AI is much more
aggressive<00:02:24.510> the<00:02:25.080> computers<00:02:25.470> race<00:02:25.650> very

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
aggressive the computers race very

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:32.120 
aggressive the computers race very
quickly<00:02:30.110> if<00:02:31.110> they<00:02:31.260> raced<00:02:31.470> at<00:02:31.650> the<00:02:31.770> speed<00:02:31.950> they

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
quickly if they raced at the speed they

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:33.530 
quickly if they raced at the speed they

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
did in Super Mario Kart I'd probably

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:38.630 
did in Super Mario Kart I'd probably
have<00:02:34.260> lapped<00:02:34.560> like<00:02:35.400> half<00:02:35.670> of<00:02:35.850> them<00:02:37.490> but<00:02:38.490> there

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640 
have lapped like half of them but there

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.250 
have lapped like half of them but there
are<00:02:38.730> some<00:02:38.910> courses<00:02:39.150> where<00:02:40.340> you<00:02:41.340> can<00:02:41.880> race

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:42.260 
are some courses where you can race

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.630 
are some courses where you can race
pretty<00:02:43.260> much<00:02:43.470> at<00:02:43.620> full<00:02:43.830> speed<00:02:44.070> the<00:02:44.250> whole<00:02:44.370> time

lose all your speed and that's a very

lose all your speed and that's a very

hit<00:04:10.920> if<00:04:11.790> you<00:04:11.880> jump<00:04:12.150> against<00:04:12.450> the<00:04:12.660> breakable

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:13.049 
hit if you jump against the breakable

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:14.630 
hit if you jump against the breakable
block<00:04:13.230> and<00:04:13.440> try<00:04:13.590> to<00:04:13.650> continue<00:04:13.980> for<00:04:14.310> instance

block and try to continue for instance

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.289 
block and try to continue for instance
you'll<00:04:15.480> just<00:04:15.810> fall<00:04:16.140> into<00:04:16.320> the<00:04:16.500> pit<00:04:16.709> and

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:17.299 
you'll just fall into the pit and

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:19.370 
you'll just fall into the pit and
that'll<00:04:18.299> slow<00:04:18.479> you<00:04:18.540> down<00:04:18.690> and<00:04:19.019> out<00:04:19.079> for<00:04:19.140> the

00:04:19.370 --> 00:04:19.380 
that'll slow you down and out for the

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:25.120 
that'll slow you down and out for the
computers<00:04:19.799> to<00:04:19.950> jump<00:04:20.370> out<00:04:20.519> ahead<00:04:20.669> of<00:04:20.880> you<00:04:21.620> so<00:04:22.620> I

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:25.130 

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:27.590 

generally<00:04:26.130> think<00:04:26.910> it's<00:04:27.030> a<00:04:27.120> little<00:04:27.330> bit<00:04:27.450> safer

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:27.600 
generally think it's a little bit safer

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.440 
generally think it's a little bit safer
if<00:04:27.900> you<00:04:27.960> hit<00:04:28.200> one<00:04:28.380> of<00:04:28.410> those<00:04:28.590> to<00:04:29.430> just<00:04:30.060> sort<00:04:30.330> of

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:30.450 
if you hit one of those to just sort of

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:33.380 
if you hit one of those to just sort of
turn<00:04:31.229> yourself<00:04:31.680> by<00:04:31.919> hopping<00:04:32.190> repeatedly<00:04:33.030> and

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:33.390 
turn yourself by hopping repeatedly and

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:36.969 
turn yourself by hopping repeatedly and
slowly<00:04:34.169> work<00:04:34.560> your<00:04:34.590> way<00:04:34.820> out<00:04:35.820> from<00:04:36.270> the<00:04:36.390> wall

00:04:36.969 --> 00:04:36.979 
slowly work your way out from the wall

00:04:36.979 --> 00:04:44.100 
slowly work your way out from the wall
but<00:04:37.979> even<00:04:38.250> that<00:04:38.370> this<00:04:38.580> is<00:04:38.760> you<00:04:38.880> a<00:04:38.910> lot<00:04:39.180> of<00:04:39.300> time

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:44.110 

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:46.930 

now<00:04:45.110> this<00:04:45.320> romhack<00:04:45.560> does<00:04:46.010> use<00:04:46.280> jumps<00:04:46.760> a<00:04:46.850> little

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:46.940 
now this romhack does use jumps a little

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:49.480 
now this romhack does use jumps a little
bit<00:04:47.150> more<00:04:47.360> than<00:04:47.540> Super<00:04:47.780> Mario<00:04:47.990> Kart<00:04:48.370> but<00:04:49.370> it

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:49.490 
bit more than Super Mario Kart but it

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:51.310 
bit more than Super Mario Kart but it
uses<00:04:49.790> them<00:04:49.940> tastefully<00:04:50.480> I<00:04:50.510> played<00:04:50.810> a<00:04:50.840> few<00:04:51.080> rom

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:51.320 
uses them tastefully I played a few rom

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:54.160 
uses them tastefully I played a few rom
hacks<00:04:51.560> said.but<00:04:52.540> jumps<00:04:53.540> in<00:04:53.690> pretty<00:04:54.110> much

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:54.170 
hacks said.but jumps in pretty much

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:57.940 
hacks said.but jumps in pretty much
every<00:04:54.500> course<00:04:54.740> this<00:04:55.730> game<00:04:55.970> uses<00:04:56.800> jumps<00:04:57.800> in

00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:57.950 
every course this game uses jumps in

00:04:57.950 --> 00:05:01.690 
every course this game uses jumps in
probably<00:04:58.700> four<00:04:58.970> or<00:04:59.210> five<00:04:59.510> courses<00:05:00.700> but

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:01.700 
probably four or five courses but

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:06.999 
probably four or five courses but
they're<00:05:01.850> rather<00:05:02.000> tastefully<00:05:02.540> done

00:05:06.999 --> 00:05:07.009 

00:05:07.009 --> 00:05:09.289 

this<00:05:08.009> is<00:05:08.159> a<00:05:08.189> very<00:05:08.399> quick<00:05:08.639> about<00:05:08.909> the<00:05:09.089> class<00:05:09.269> of

00:05:09.289 --> 00:05:09.299 
this is a very quick about the class of

00:05:09.299 --> 00:05:10.850 
this is a very quick about the class of
cars<00:05:09.629> quicker<00:05:09.959> than<00:05:10.169> any<00:05:10.349> of<00:05:10.439> the<00:05:10.529> ones<00:05:10.709> in<00:05:10.799> the

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:10.860 
cars quicker than any of the ones in the

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:18.890 
cars quicker than any of the ones in the
original<00:05:11.249> Super<00:05:11.429> Mario<00:05:11.580> Kart

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:18.900 

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:22.310 

it's<00:05:19.500> looking<00:05:19.980> pretty<00:05:20.250> easy<00:05:20.610> right<00:05:20.910> now<00:05:21.320> but

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:22.320 
it's looking pretty easy right now but

00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:24.350 
it's looking pretty easy right now but
it's<00:05:22.470> easy<00:05:22.650> to<00:05:22.830> bump<00:05:23.010> into<00:05:23.370> a<00:05:23.400> wall<00:05:23.700> or<00:05:23.730> a<00:05:24.030> swamp

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:24.360 
it's easy to bump into a wall or a swamp

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:26.780 
it's easy to bump into a wall or a swamp
and<00:05:24.810> the<00:05:25.470> speed<00:05:25.710> you<00:05:25.830> lose<00:05:26.040> allows<00:05:26.640> the

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:26.790 
and the speed you lose allows the

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:28.970 
and the speed you lose allows the
computers<00:05:27.180> to<00:05:27.300> catch<00:05:27.480> up<00:05:27.690> again<00:05:27.840> I<00:05:28.170> can<00:05:28.800> race

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:28.980 
computers to catch up again I can race

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:30.830 
computers to catch up again I can race
very<00:05:29.370> smoothly<00:05:29.790> but<00:05:30.090> the<00:05:30.210> computers<00:05:30.600> will

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:30.840 
very smoothly but the computers will

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:33.410 
very smoothly but the computers will
always<00:05:31.620> be<00:05:31.770> pretty<00:05:32.100> close<00:05:32.430> behind<00:05:32.670> I'm

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:33.420 
always be pretty close behind I'm

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:34.940 
always be pretty close behind I'm
actually<00:05:33.540> making<00:05:33.840> some<00:05:34.080> decent<00:05:34.260> distance<00:05:34.830> on

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:34.950

but did that won't be the case in all

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:45.860 
but did that won't be the case in all
the<00:05:42.570> courses<00:05:42.750> in<00:05:43.050> this<00:05:43.140> game<00:05:44.630> you<00:05:45.630> can<00:05:45.750> get

the courses in this game you can get

the courses in this game you can get
lots<00:05:46.050> of<00:05:46.230> speed<00:05:46.530> boosters<00:05:46.920> here<00:05:47.130> now<00:05:47.790> there's

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:48.510 
lots of speed boosters here now there's

00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:50.680 
lots of speed boosters here now there's
a<00:05:48.600> bit<00:05:48.810> of<00:05:48.900> a<00:05:48.990> difficulty<00:05:49.620> with<00:05:49.800> that<00:05:49.830> jump<00:05:50.280> I

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:50.690 
a bit of a difficulty with that jump I

00:05:50.690 --> 00:05:52.910 
a bit of a difficulty with that jump I
found<00:05:51.690> that<00:05:51.810> sometimes<00:05:52.050> when<00:05:52.440> I<00:05:52.470> take<00:05:52.740> it

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:52.920 
found that sometimes when I take it

00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:53.590 
found that sometimes when I take it
turning

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:56.520 
instead of properly jumping in taking

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:58.750 
instead of properly jumping in taking
the<00:05:56.610> speed<00:05:56.850> boost<00:05:57.090> and<00:05:57.330> jumping<00:05:57.630> over<00:05:57.870> the

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:02.520 
over the part of the track I'll hit the

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:06.140 
over the part of the track I'll hit the
wall<00:06:02.700> and<00:06:03.590> then<00:06:04.590> hit<00:06:04.860> the<00:06:05.010> jump<00:06:05.220> boost<00:06:05.460> and

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:06.150 
wall and then hit the jump boost and

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:08.030 
wall and then hit the jump boost and
it'll<00:06:06.390> send<00:06:06.540> me<00:06:06.720> either<00:06:07.500> into<00:06:07.740> the<00:06:07.770> narrow

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:08.040 
it'll send me either into the narrow

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:11.180 
it'll send me either into the narrow
area<00:06:08.250> or<00:06:08.610> backwards<00:06:09.150> and<00:06:09.750> I<00:06:10.710> won't<00:06:10.860> be<00:06:10.980> able<00:06:11.100> to

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:11.190 
area or backwards and I won't be able to

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:14.990 
area or backwards and I won't be able to
complete<00:06:11.430> the<00:06:11.550> jump<00:06:12.200> so<00:06:13.200> I<00:06:13.910> don't<00:06:14.910> know

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:15.000 
complete the jump so I don't know

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.600 
complete the jump so I don't know
exactly<00:06:15.390> what<00:06:15.660> causes<00:06:16.020> that<00:06:16.800> to<00:06:16.860> happen<00:06:17.190> but<00:06:17.550> I

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:17.610 
exactly what causes that to happen but I

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:20.690 
exactly what causes that to happen but I
recommend<00:06:17.970> coming<00:06:18.870> into<00:06:19.050> the<00:06:19.260> jump<00:06:19.700> as

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:20.700 
recommend coming into the jump as

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:26.420 
recommend coming into the jump as
straight<00:06:21.030> as<00:06:21.150> possible

00:06:26.420 --> 00:06:26.430

and<00:06:26.630> this<00:06:27.630> track<00:06:27.930> the<00:06:28.470> basic<00:06:28.830> idea<00:06:29.130> of<00:06:29.280> this

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:29.400 
and this track the basic idea of this

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:32.290 
and this track the basic idea of this
tractor<00:06:29.729> is<00:06:30.300> you<00:06:30.990> have<00:06:31.139> these<00:06:31.320> two<00:06:31.380> forks

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:32.300 
tractor is you have these two forks

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:34.969 
tractor is you have these two forks
while<00:06:33.300> this<00:06:33.449> fork<00:06:33.840> these<00:06:34.169> two<00:06:34.380> paths<00:06:34.650> you<00:06:34.830> can

00:06:34.969 --> 00:06:34.979 
while this fork these two paths you can

00:06:34.979 --> 00:06:39.290 
while this fork these two paths you can
take<00:06:35.039> this<00:06:35.820> windy<00:06:36.360> long<00:06:36.870> s-curve<00:06:37.530> and<00:06:38.300> path

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:39.300 
take this windy long s-curve and path

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:43.040 
take this windy long s-curve and path
from<00:06:39.479> left<00:06:40.280> that<00:06:41.280> starts<00:06:41.970> with<00:06:42.150> one<00:06:42.600> jump<00:06:42.870> and

00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:43.050 
from left that starts with one jump and

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:48.469 
from left that starts with one jump and
finishes<00:06:43.710> with<00:06:43.740> another<00:06:44.100> jump<00:06:44.370> and<00:06:47.210> I<00:06:48.210> like

00:06:48.469 --> 00:06:48.479 
finishes with another jump and I like

00:06:48.479 --> 00:06:52.670 
finishes with another jump and I like
taking<00:06:48.750> the<00:06:48.900> S<00:06:49.199> path<00:06:50.210> on<00:06:51.210> the<00:06:51.870> first<00:06:52.110> four<00:06:52.440> laps

00:06:52.670 --> 00:06:52.680 
taking the S path on the first four laps

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:59.360 
taking the S path on the first four laps
I<00:06:53.509> think<00:06:54.509> it's<00:06:54.630> just<00:06:54.900> a<00:06:55.110> little<00:06:55.320> bit<00:06:55.440> faster

00:06:59.360 --> 00:06:59.370 

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:03.689 

now<00:07:00.370> the<00:07:00.430> trick<00:07:00.699> here<00:07:00.729> is<00:07:01.090> to<00:07:01.919> to<00:07:02.919> try<00:07:03.340> to<00:07:03.400> jump

00:07:03.689 --> 00:07:03.699 
now the trick here is to to try to jump

00:07:03.699 --> 00:07:06.089 
now the trick here is to to try to jump
over<00:07:03.849> those<00:07:04.150> little<00:07:04.449> sandy<00:07:04.810> bits<00:07:04.990> in<00:07:05.560> a<00:07:05.650> siren

00:07:06.089 --> 00:07:06.099 
over those little sandy bits in a siren

00:07:06.099 --> 00:07:08.309 
over those little sandy bits in a siren
I've<00:07:06.340> been<00:07:06.580> racing<00:07:06.759> as<00:07:07.300> consistently<00:07:08.080> as<00:07:08.169> I

00:07:08.309 --> 00:07:08.319 
I've been racing as consistently as I

00:07:08.319 --> 00:07:10.800 
I've been racing as consistently as I
ever<00:07:08.530> did<00:07:08.770> in<00:07:08.949> that<00:07:09.099> original<00:07:09.699> and<00:07:10.300> I<00:07:10.509> Super

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:10.810 
ever did in that original and I Super

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:12.779 
ever did in that original and I Super
Mario<00:07:10.990> Kart<00:07:11.080> let's<00:07:11.470> play<00:07:11.680> but<00:07:12.310> the<00:07:12.400> computers

00:07:12.779 --> 00:07:12.789 
Mario Kart let's play but the computers

00:07:12.789 --> 00:07:15.570 
Mario Kart let's play but the computers
are<00:07:12.940> stolen<00:07:13.240> really<00:07:13.509> thoughts<00:07:13.690> behind<00:07:13.990> me<00:07:14.580> but

00:07:15.570 --> 00:07:15.580 
are stolen really thoughts behind me but

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:17.580 
are stolen really thoughts behind me but
is<00:07:15.699> he<00:07:15.819> on<00:07:15.849> this<00:07:16.030> last<00:07:16.270> lap<00:07:16.569> I'm<00:07:17.259> gonna<00:07:17.409> take

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:17.590 
is he on this last lap I'm gonna take

00:07:17.590 --> 00:07:19.050 
is he on this last lap I'm gonna take
the<00:07:17.710> other<00:07:17.830> fork<00:07:18.159> because<00:07:18.310> it<00:07:18.580> passes<00:07:18.729> you

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:19.060 
the other fork because it passes you

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:20.339 
the other fork because it passes you
across<00:07:19.330> the<00:07:19.539> finish<00:07:19.690> line<00:07:19.810> a<00:07:20.020> little<00:07:20.229> bit

00:07:20.339 --> 00:07:20.349 
across the finish line a little bit

00:07:20.349 --> 00:07:23.790 
across the finish line a little bit
earlier<00:07:20.680> and<00:07:21.810> what<00:07:22.810> I<00:07:22.840> do<00:07:22.960> here<00:07:23.289> as<00:07:23.379> I<00:07:23.470> cut<00:07:23.680> off

00:07:23.790 --> 00:07:23.800 
earlier and what I do here as I cut off

00:07:23.800 --> 00:07:27.839 
earlier and what I do here as I cut off
by<00:07:24.699> the<00:07:24.729> dinner<00:07:25.740> and<00:07:26.740> try<00:07:27.460> not<00:07:27.580> to<00:07:27.639> lose

00:07:27.839 --> 00:07:27.849 
by the dinner and try not to lose

00:07:27.849 --> 00:07:29.460 
by the dinner and try not to lose
control<00:07:28.030> like<00:07:28.389> that<00:07:28.629> and<00:07:28.870> that<00:07:28.960> way<00:07:29.110> I<00:07:29.139> past

00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:29.470 
control like that and that way I past

00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:32.070 
control like that and that way I past
the<00:07:29.620> finish<00:07:29.860> line<00:07:30.039> well<00:07:30.819> before<00:07:31.210> Yoshi<00:07:31.750> does

00:07:32.070 --> 00:07:32.080 
the finish line well before Yoshi does

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:35.249 
the finish line well before Yoshi does
know<00:07:32.770> she's<00:07:32.830> caught<00:07:33.430> up<00:07:33.550> to<00:07:33.819> me<00:07:34.810> partly

00:07:35.249 --> 00:07:35.259 
know she's caught up to me partly

00:07:35.259 --> 00:07:37.170 
know she's caught up to me partly
because<00:07:35.409> your<00:07:36.190> character<00:07:36.340> slows<00:07:36.729> down<00:07:37.000> when

00:07:37.170 --> 00:07:37.180 
because your character slows down when

00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:40.709 
because your character slows down when
he<00:07:37.960> passes<00:07:38.349> the<00:07:38.469> finish<00:07:38.710> line<00:07:38.889> but<00:07:39.599> you<00:07:40.599> can

00:07:40.709 --> 00:07:40.719 
he passes the finish line but you can

00:07:40.719 --> 00:07:42.719 
he passes the finish line but you can
see<00:07:40.870> I<00:07:40.900> finished<00:07:41.199> a<00:07:41.620> host<00:07:41.979> of<00:07:42.340> all<00:07:42.520> three

00:07:42.719 --> 00:07:42.729 
see I finished a host of all three

00:07:42.729 --> 00:07:46.409 
see I finished a host of all three
seconds<00:07:43.180> before<00:07:43.330> Yoshi<00:07:43.659> did<00:07:44.969> now<00:07:45.969> I<00:07:46.000> made<00:07:46.270> that

00:07:46.409 --> 00:07:46.419 
seconds before Yoshi did now I made that

00:07:46.419 --> 00:07:48.749 
seconds before Yoshi did now I made that
seem<00:07:46.690> easier<00:07:47.020> than<00:07:47.199> it<00:07:47.289> is<00:07:47.319> I<00:07:47.680> was<00:07:48.400> a<00:07:48.430> little

00:07:48.749 --> 00:07:48.759 
seem easier than it is I was a little

00:07:48.759 --> 00:07:51.629 
seem easier than it is I was a little
bit<00:07:48.849> lucky<00:07:49.030> this<00:07:49.300> time<00:07:49.360> but<00:07:50.159> the<00:07:51.159> rest<00:07:51.430> of<00:07:51.550> the

00:07:51.629 --> 00:07:51.639 
bit lucky this time but the rest of the

00:07:51.639 --> 00:07:53.129 
bit lucky this time but the rest of the
tracks<00:07:51.849> in<00:07:52.030> the<00:07:52.120> game<00:07:52.240> are<00:07:52.479> even<00:07:52.990> more

00:07:53.129 --> 00:07:53.139 
tracks in the game are even more

00:07:53.139 --> 00:07:55.020 
tracks in the game are even more
difficult<00:07:53.590> and<00:07:53.770> we'll<00:07:53.949> see<00:07:54.129> if<00:07:54.219> I<00:07:54.310> can<00:07:54.520> keep<00:07:54.879> up

00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:55.030 
difficult and we'll see if I can keep up

00:07:55.030 --> 00:07:57.899 
difficult and we'll see if I can keep up
the<00:07:55.270> first<00:07:55.479> places<00:07:56.250> thanks<00:07:57.250> for<00:07:57.400> watching<00:07:57.759> and

00:07:57.899 --> 00:07:57.909 
the first places thanks for watching and

00:07:57.909 --> 00:08:01.229 
the first places thanks for watching and
I'll<00:07:58.000> catch<00:07:58.150> you<00:07:58.270> on<00:07:58.449> the<00:07:58.509> next<00:07:58.599> episode
