turn<00:00:44.559> it<00:00:44.680> on<00:00:44.800> now<00:00:45.010> here<00:00:45.970> we<00:00:46.120> can<00:00:46.150> see<00:00:46.449> the<00:00:46.570> drive

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:46.780 
turn it on now here we can see the drive

turn it on now here we can see the drive
shaft<00:00:47.080> is<00:00:47.320> turn<00:00:47.650> now<00:00:48.370> with<00:00:49.059> the<00:00:49.239> angles<00:00:49.629> the

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:49.690 
shaft is turn now with the angles the

same and the universal joints in line

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:54.509 
same and the universal joints in line
we<00:00:53.080> have<00:00:53.199> no<00:00:53.500> acceleration<00:00:54.280> and<00:00:54.430> deceleration

we have no acceleration and deceleration

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:56.820 
we have no acceleration and deceleration
happen<00:00:55.390> there's<00:00:55.989> couple<00:00:56.229> ways<00:00:56.409> that<00:00:56.620> we<00:00:56.680> can

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:56.830 
happen there's couple ways that we can

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:58.979 
happen there's couple ways that we can
show<00:00:57.010> this<00:00:57.159> one<00:00:57.729> we<00:00:57.879> control<00:00:58.269> it<00:00:58.360> visually<00:00:58.720> we

00:00:58.979 --> 00:00:58.989 
show this one we control it visually we

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:01.530 
show this one we control it visually we
can<00:00:59.019> also<00:00:59.260> show<00:00:59.530> it<00:00:59.589> audibly<00:01:00.220> so<00:01:00.970> if<00:01:01.210> I<00:01:01.330> take

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:01.540 
can also show it audibly so if I take

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:11.550 
can also show it audibly so if I take
business<00:01:02.440> card<00:01:02.680> and<00:01:03.339> we<00:01:03.489> this<00:01:10.500> sounds<00:01:11.500> the

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:11.560 
business card and we this sounds the

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.330 
business card and we this sounds the
same<00:01:12.210> by<00:01:13.210> changing<00:01:13.659> perspective<00:01:14.229> we<00:01:14.830> can<00:01:15.040> see

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:15.340 
same by changing perspective we can see

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.770 
same by changing perspective we can see
visually<00:01:15.850> that<00:01:18.150> every<00:01:19.150> point<00:01:19.390> along<00:01:19.600> the

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:19.780 
visually that every point along the

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.580 
visually that every point along the
shaft<00:01:20.020> it's<00:01:20.920> turning<00:01:21.220> at<00:01:21.340> the<00:01:21.430> same<00:01:21.640> speed<00:01:22.590> now

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:23.590 
shaft it's turning at the same speed now

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.190 
shaft it's turning at the same speed now
obviously<00:01:24.120> the<00:01:25.120> shaft<00:01:25.390> was<00:01:25.690> always<00:01:25.990> in<00:01:26.140> a

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:26.200 
obviously the shaft was always in a

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.140 
obviously the shaft was always in a
straight<00:01:26.470> line<00:01:26.680> and<00:01:26.920> there<00:01:27.400> was<00:01:27.520> no<00:01:27.700> angles

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:28.150 
straight line and there was no angles

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:29.670 
straight line and there was no angles
involved<00:01:28.420> we<00:01:29.020> would<00:01:29.140> never<00:01:29.320> have<00:01:29.410> any

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:29.680 
involved we would never have any

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.070 
involved we would never have any
problems<00:01:30.130> so<00:01:30.940> what<00:01:31.090> happens<00:01:31.570> when<00:01:31.870> we

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:32.080 
problems so what happens when we

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.950 
problems so what happens when we
introduce<00:01:32.110> an<00:01:32.710> angle<00:01:33.390> into<00:01:34.390> a<00:01:34.420> system<00:01:34.810> with

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:34.960 
introduce an angle into a system with

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:51.670 
introduce an angle into a system with
two<00:01:35.910> universal<00:01:36.910> joints

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:51.680 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.750 

now<00:01:52.680> here<00:01:52.980> we<00:01:53.130> can<00:01:53.159> see<00:01:53.930> speed<00:01:54.930> is<00:01:55.080> constant

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:55.760 
now here we can see speed is constant

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.219 
now here we can see speed is constant
now<00:01:56.760> we<00:01:56.820> have<00:01:57.150> an<00:01:57.270> acceleration<00:01:57.870> and

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
now we have an acceleration and

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:01.610 
now we have an acceleration and
deceleration<00:01:59.210> now<00:02:00.210> at<00:02:00.360> this<00:02:00.510> end<00:02:00.810> because<00:02:01.440> the

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:01.620 
deceleration now at this end because the

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:03.860 
deceleration now at this end because the
universal<00:02:02.100> joints<00:02:02.430> are<00:02:02.580> in<00:02:02.790> phase<00:02:03.030> the

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:03.870 
universal joints are in phase the

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:06.290 
universal joints are in phase the
accelerations<00:02:04.530> and<00:02:04.740> decelerations<00:02:05.300> cancel

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:06.300 
accelerations and decelerations cancel

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:21.380 
accelerations and decelerations cancel
out<00:02:06.450> now<00:02:07.440> let's<00:02:07.650> listen<00:02:07.830> to<00:02:08.039> the<00:02:08.190> noises<00:02:20.390> here

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390 
out now let's listen to the noises here

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:23.330 
out now let's listen to the noises here
in<00:02:21.990> the<00:02:22.140> middle<00:02:22.440> we<00:02:22.650> can<00:02:22.680> hear<00:02:23.070> a<00:02:23.100> difference

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:23.340 
in the middle we can hear a difference

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.130 
in the middle we can hear a difference
in<00:02:23.820> the<00:02:24.239> noise<00:02:24.420> we're<00:02:24.660> hearing<00:02:24.959> the

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
in the noise we're hearing the

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.790 
in the noise we're hearing the
acceleration<00:02:25.800> and<00:02:25.980> deceleration<00:02:27.200> so<00:02:28.200> as<00:02:28.440> long

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:28.800 
acceleration and deceleration so as long

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:31.460 
acceleration and deceleration so as long
as<00:02:29.010> the<00:02:29.100> two<00:02:29.280> angles<00:02:29.730> are<00:02:29.850> the<00:02:29.940> same<00:02:30.470> the

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
as the two angles are the same the

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.290 
as the two angles are the same the
accelerations<00:02:32.220> and<00:02:32.400> decelerations

accelerations and decelerations

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.900 
accelerations and decelerations
will<00:02:33.690> cats<00:02:33.959> look<00:02:34.260> what<00:02:35.160> happens<00:02:35.610> if<00:02:35.760> the

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
will cats look what happens if the

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:43.699 
will cats look what happens if the
angles<00:02:36.270> aren't<00:02:36.450> the<00:02:36.570> same<00:02:42.140> here<00:02:43.140> we<00:02:43.320> can<00:02:43.470> see

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709 
angles aren't the same here we can see

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:46.070 
angles aren't the same here we can see
that<00:02:43.920> we<00:02:44.670> don't<00:02:44.820> have<00:02:44.910> the<00:02:45.000> same<00:02:45.269> angle<00:02:45.690> for

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:46.080 
that we don't have the same angle for

that we don't have the same angle for
this<00:02:46.200> universal<00:02:46.830> trend<00:02:47.040> as<00:02:47.280> for<00:02:47.940> this<00:02:48.060> one

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:00.340 
decelerations at this end we have a

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:02.610 
decelerations at this end we have a
constant<00:05:00.910> speed<00:05:01.000> in<00:05:01.390> the<00:05:02.230> middle<00:05:02.470> we<00:05:02.590> have

some accelerations and decelerations and

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:09.690 
some accelerations and decelerations and
now<00:05:05.770> we<00:05:05.830> have<00:05:06.220> the<00:05:06.640> maximum<00:05:07.380> exaggeration<00:05:08.700> now

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:09.700
