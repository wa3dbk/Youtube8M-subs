00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
that um because I think they had written

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.620 
that um because I think they had written
in<00:01:58.110> that<00:01:58.500> that<00:01:58.950> scene<00:01:59.340> and<00:01:59.610> I<00:01:59.759> was<00:01:59.790> I<00:02:00.210> just<00:02:00.509> had

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
in that that scene and I was I just had

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.030 
in that that scene and I was I just had
the<00:02:00.719> twins<00:02:00.990> that<00:02:01.079> I<00:02:01.170> was<00:02:01.350> nursing<00:02:01.829> and<00:02:01.979> I

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:02.040 
the twins that I was nursing and I

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.980 
the twins that I was nursing and I
thought<00:02:02.250> well<00:02:03.119> this<00:02:03.390> is<00:02:03.600> kind<00:02:03.810> of<00:02:03.840> like<00:02:03.960> a

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
thought well this is kind of like a

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.990 
thought well this is kind of like a
borrowed<00:02:04.409> body<00:02:04.770> you<00:02:05.250> know<00:02:05.399> this<00:02:05.790> is<00:02:05.969> a

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
borrowed body you know this is a

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.320 
borrowed body you know this is a
temporary<00:02:06.390> situation<00:02:07.079> and<00:02:07.920> that<00:02:08.670> exactly<00:02:09.209> was

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
temporary situation and that exactly was

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.460 
temporary situation and that exactly was
the<00:02:09.420> argument<00:02:09.690> I<00:02:09.720> think<00:02:09.750> believe<00:02:10.170> Danny's

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
the argument I think believe Danny's

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:11.750 
the argument I think believe Danny's
look<00:02:10.619> at<00:02:10.739> her<00:02:10.800> roadside<00:02:11.160> episode<00:02:11.520> was<00:02:11.610> like
