and<00:01:58.700> we'll

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:45.780 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:52.430 

I<00:02:46.850> think<00:02:48.560> we<00:02:49.560> try<00:02:49.800> line<00:02:50.190> seven<00:02:50.700> on<00:02:50.820> its<00:02:51.000> own<00:02:51.440> the

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:52.440 
I think we try line seven on its own the

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.740 
I think we try line seven on its own the
beeps<00:02:52.710> she's<00:02:53.370> like<00:02:53.520> seven<00:02:53.970> and<00:02:54.120> try<00:02:54.330> that<00:02:54.480> one

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
beeps she's like seven and try that one

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:57.080 
beeps she's like seven and try that one
more<00:02:54.780> time<00:02:55.020> a<00:02:55.740> little<00:02:56.190> more<00:02:56.340> how<00:02:56.790> to<00:02:56.850> be

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
more time a little more how to be

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:20.780 
more time a little more how to be
attitude<00:02:57.720> into<00:02:58.020> it<00:03:18.590> we<00:03:19.590> probably<00:03:20.160> work<00:03:20.400> on<00:03:20.580> it

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790 
attitude into it we probably work on it

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.190 
attitude into it we probably work on it
a<00:03:20.880> little<00:03:20.970> bit<00:03:21.209> longer<00:03:21.450> in<00:03:21.750> this<00:03:21.840> video

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:22.200 
a little bit longer in this video

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.170 
a little bit longer in this video
because<00:03:22.530> it's<00:03:22.709> going<00:03:22.860> a<00:03:23.070> little<00:03:23.160> long<00:03:23.430> but<00:03:23.970> the

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:24.180 
because it's going a little long but the

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:26.510 
because it's going a little long but the
performance<00:03:24.900> is<00:03:24.989> really<00:03:25.230> good<00:03:25.530> so<00:03:26.220> let's<00:03:26.400> play

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:26.520 
performance is really good so let's play

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:38.500 
performance is really good so let's play
the<00:03:26.640> back

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:04:05.530 

anyway

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:05.540 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:13.250 

they<00:04:06.540> seemed<00:04:06.870> like<00:04:07.050> you<00:04:11.720> will<00:04:12.720> we<00:04:12.900> like<00:04:13.110> her

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:13.260 
they seemed like you will we like her

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.020 
they seemed like you will we like her
too<00:04:13.500> I<00:04:13.830> think<00:04:13.980> this<00:04:14.370> is<00:04:14.580> another<00:04:14.820> one<00:04:15.000> that

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:15.030 
too I think this is another one that

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:18.430 
too I think this is another one that
kayaker<00:04:15.570> wants<00:04:15.870> her<00:04:15.990> phone<00:04:16.260> number

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.440 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:23.660 

so<00:04:19.440> the<00:04:19.940> reactions<00:04:20.940> what's<00:04:22.310> how<00:04:23.310> do<00:04:23.370> you<00:04:23.520> how

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:23.670 
so the reactions what's how do you how

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:25.130 
so the reactions what's how do you how
come<00:04:23.850> you<00:04:23.970> know<00:04:24.090> how<00:04:24.210> to<00:04:24.270> do<00:04:24.480> those<00:04:24.690> because

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:25.140 
come you know how to do those because

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:27.200 
come you know how to do those because
those<00:04:25.320> are<00:04:25.380> really<00:04:25.560> hard<00:04:26.220> they<00:04:26.790> take<00:04:26.940> a<00:04:27.030> lot<00:04:27.180> of

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:27.210 
those are really hard they take a lot of

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:54.850 
those are really hard they take a lot of
work<00:04:51.170> you<00:04:52.170> said<00:04:52.640> about<00:04:53.640> the<00:04:53.910> internet
