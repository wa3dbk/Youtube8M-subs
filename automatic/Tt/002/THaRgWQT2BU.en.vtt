00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 at the international book fair of 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:06.629
 Bogota 2014 I had the pleasure of 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:10.110
 meet my great friend putting together 

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:13.230
 to get lost doctor surgeon creator of the 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.269
 psychoneuroimmunology technique 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:18.570
 celebrating the launching very happy 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:21.029
 of his book make it happen to make 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.670
 things happen that collect 20 years of 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:26.070
 research assembling us precise 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:28.680
 concepts about his technique we call him 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:32.099
 with eur penis immunotherapy and technical 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.899
 Bashing is basically how it works 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.840
 the brain then is the result of 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:39.180
 20 years of research 350 thousand 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.730
 people in how are the rhythms 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.940
 brain and how to do 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:47.309
 materialize projects basically the 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.350
 Hyper summary would be all people 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:51.960
 they want not all of us want something but there's 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.329
 a giant instance between what you 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:56.550
 wants what you get 

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:59.030
 and that happens because people though 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.289
 we all have longings the brain is 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.719
 trained to understand the life of a single 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:05.100
 way then you want but you understand 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:08.070
 in a way and how do you understand a 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:11.009
 way what you do sometimes does not bring you 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:15.390
 what you want and people fill 

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:19.060
 that space with justifications is that 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:21.850
 was that why but even though 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:24.460
 when you justify yourself starting to have the 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.920
 clear reason then one says starting 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:29.710
 who is right is reviewed what he did 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:31.899
 and when you review that I am perfect 

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:35.080
 because I checked here here and this 

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:36.399
 the result is fine then an entity 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.039
 they still have the world of it 

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:40.899
 way its justification becomes real and 

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:43.619
 every time what you want were far from 

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:43.619
 what he gets 

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:48.740
 and something that is called frustration appears 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.810
 fear anxiety anxiety stress 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.790
 Rage 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.229
 what's up with that then the people are 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:55.850
 they usually process the same 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:58.430
 way understand the same way and open 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:01.820
 the same neuronal groups when the 

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:05.149
 archives are maintained sustainably that 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:07.100
 it's file that holds makes every 

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:09.380
 Once a new stimulus comes in, 

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:12.530
 brain seeks what it knows for 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:15.370
 keep your reality then the book 

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:18.430
 is designed so that while you're 

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:22.310
 reading from emape is the nervous system 

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:23.980
 now other brain files of 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.630
 way that with the new synapses 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:28.519
 you understand the different world and you get 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:31.430
 realize that if what you are doing to 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:33.049
 getting to the result does not work because it does not 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:36.380
 you are going to do and what is convenient 

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:37.730
 do to get what you want 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:39.770
 It has been many years of research 

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:43.600
 to put a lot of neurophysiology 

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:45.370
 simple is designed so that 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:49.760
 anyone can understand 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:51.799
 Neurosurgeon a housewife 

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:54.110
 all the physiology put so 

00:02:51.799 --> 00:02:55.890
 fun and nice note this 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.870
 dolly 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:00.270
 and the intention to leave these spaces for 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:03.000
 that you write what you are understanding 

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:05.459
 then a paragraph and the paragraph makes you 

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.410
 process understand the different world what 

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:09.000
 what you do is write a 

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:10.920
 week later he reads the same 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.140
 paragraph and what he understands is 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:15.480
 completely different write that another 

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:17.959
 time and you will notice that three or four laws 

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.780
 from paragraph three or four 

00:03:17.959 --> 00:03:24.260
 perceptions of the different world 

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:27.050
 when you do that when you make those new 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:29.230
 perceptions is that way of understanding 

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:29.230
 the world 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:34.620
 and then it looks like a confrontation like 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:37.409
 a strategy of 

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:39.659
 to prepare you for what comes six 

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:41.760
 months later you realize that what 

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:43.290
 you have written what you are doing in 

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.260
 different contexts without having to 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:48.030
 think another way to use the book is 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:50.010
 simple you think of something I want 

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:54.180
 do this for when you have it in the 

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:55.860
 hand with the book they say and think of a 

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.989
 problem ok 

00:03:55.860 --> 00:04:01.840
 then to activate prefrontal cortex the 

00:03:57.989 --> 00:04:04.599
 inhalation intelligence area inhales 

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:07.670
 and you look up and at that moment 

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:10.370
 questions that I need to know 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:12.660
 then you smile opens is the book 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:14.970
 on any page 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:17.519
 Now it's the book and you read one or two or 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:20.750
 three paragraphs and you're going to find the 

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:22.790
 solution to what you were thinking 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:24.440
 it's a super fun way not what 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:27.690
 not otherwise were my students 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:30.960
 who discovered that 

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:33.300
 the prologue is by john grinder the creator 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:37.500
 of neurolinguistics and for me it is 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:39.600
 no no because my dad is the one who is 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:42.249
 writing when daddy is my 

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:44.559
 mentor my mentor who is already 

00:04:42.249 --> 00:04:46.029
 and is saying something fantastic what 

00:04:44.559 --> 00:04:48.940
 we are doing and rethinking the 

00:04:46.029 --> 00:04:51.790
 medicine in another way 

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:55.060
 the most important part of this is such 

00:04:51.790 --> 00:04:56.800
 once we do not get sick maybe the 

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:59.470
 disease does not exist what exists are 

00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:02.140
 the adaptations maybe when not 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:04.070
 they have money in the bag they do not have 

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:06.020
 money 

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:09.230
 maybe it's not that there is no money is that 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:10.730
 We'll be sick in the pocket if something 

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:12.710
 we are misunderstanding the world when 

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:14.360
 you understand more of the evil of the world because what 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:16.040
 what you keep doing keeps pulling you out 

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:18.200
 money to pocket and instead of 

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:20.600
 focus on what you want you focus 

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:23.390
 in what you know is not what you can 

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:25.120
 do then we are questioning and 

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:28.280
 giving tools to remove fears 

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:30.200
 to produce prosperity to improve 

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:33.530
 sexual life to improve the 

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:34.760
 relationships to improve the solution of 

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:40.010
 problems 

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:43.280
 it's basically make it happen do that 

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:46.760
 things happen that things happen and 

00:05:43.280 --> 00:05:50.380
 it's a way to stop being the one 

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:53.930
 one is and can do what is best for you 

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:55.430
 and what does it mean to stop being look at what 

00:05:53.930 --> 00:05:57.100
 the worst thing you can do to one is when 

00:05:55.430 --> 00:06:00.620
 he says it 's fantastic never change 

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:02.810
 because if you have problems now and he is 

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:05.810
 fantastic you jo 

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:08.420
 then you have to stop being who you are and 

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:10.670
 be someone better every time 

00:06:08.420 --> 00:06:12.890
 and perhaps it is that if I'm still me who 

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:15.050
 I'm still understanding the same thing 

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:17.060
 I'm going to do it's going to take me 

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:19.590
 results that I have the question is 

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:21.240
 think about your current results 

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:23.370
 in any medium of the mental physicist 

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:25.650
 emotional spiritual economic material 

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:28.290
 financial at any level think about 

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:31.740
 your results if you do not like those 

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:33.840
 results you have to do something else 

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:36.539
 but you can not do them and it's still 

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:40.349
 the same you have to stop being who you are 

00:06:36.539 --> 00:06:44.430
 to do what one can be is that 

00:06:40.349 --> 00:06:46.229
 the thing happens mx to end thanks arming 

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:49.810
 it's good to have found you here 

00:06:46.229 --> 00:06:52.680
 friend colleague 

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:58.050
 well I 'm going to the task of reading the book 

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:58.050
 buy and I 'll tell you 

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:06.720
 serve them as much as I know they are going to 

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:06.720
 serve thank you arming keep smiling
