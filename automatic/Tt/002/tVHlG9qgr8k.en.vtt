00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
do the test we have to find out what the

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.620 
do the test we have to find out what the
cold<00:01:39.960> cranking<00:01:40.380> amps<00:01:40.619> are<00:01:41.189> of<00:01:41.460> our<00:01:42.000> battery

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 
cold cranking amps are of our battery

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:44.749 
cold cranking amps are of our battery
now<00:01:43.439> if<00:01:43.530> you<00:01:43.649> look<00:01:43.829> right<00:01:44.009> down<00:01:44.189> here<00:01:44.490> on<00:01:44.610> this

now if you look right down here on this

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:49.730 
now if you look right down here on this
battery<00:01:45.030> it<00:01:45.630> has<00:01:45.740> 600<00:01:46.740> cold<00:01:47.310> cranking<00:01:47.670> amps<00:01:48.740> so

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
battery it has 600 cold cranking amps so

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.800 
battery it has 600 cold cranking amps so
write<00:01:50.009> that<00:01:50.039> figure<00:01:50.549> down<00:01:50.759> and<00:01:51.329> keep<00:01:51.539> track<00:01:51.750> of

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
write that figure down and keep track of

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.440 
write that figure down and keep track of
it<00:01:52.219> okay<00:01:53.219> we're<00:01:53.369> just<00:01:53.399> about<00:01:53.700> ready<00:01:53.759> to<00:01:54.119> do<00:01:54.270> our

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
it okay we're just about ready to do our

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.770 
it okay we're just about ready to do our
test<00:01:55.369> this<00:01:56.369> is<00:01:56.579> the<00:01:56.700> scale<00:01:57.000> we<00:01:57.210> hope<00:01:57.420> that<00:01:57.659> the

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:57.780 
test this is the scale we hope that the

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.310 
test this is the scale we hope that the
meter<00:01:58.020> will<00:01:58.320> be<00:01:58.500> in<00:01:58.680> and<00:01:59.149> mine<00:02:00.149> is<00:02:00.390> a<00:02:00.420> 600<00:02:01.109> cold

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
meter will be in and mine is a 600 cold

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:04.039 
meter will be in and mine is a 600 cold
cranking<00:02:01.530> amps<00:02:01.740> so<00:02:02.729> it<00:02:02.850> should<00:02:03.060> be<00:02:03.090> the<00:02:03.329> s<00:02:03.420> 600

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
cranking amps so it should be the s 600

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:08.630 
cranking amps so it should be the s 600
now<00:02:04.979> I'm<00:02:05.280> going<00:02:05.609> to<00:02:05.759> press<00:02:06.719> this<00:02:06.990> button<00:02:07.640> for
