00:03:55.290 --> 00:03:58.370 
they're all level one cannon so they'd
only<00:03:55.380> it<00:03:55.799> would<00:03:55.920> only<00:03:56.040> take<00:03:56.160> two<00:03:56.700> of<00:03:56.940> my<00:03:57.380> my

00:03:58.370 --> 00:03:58.380 
only it would only take two of my my

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:01.400 
only it would only take two of my my
mortars<00:03:58.829> to<00:03:59.610> take<00:04:00.090> them<00:04:00.239> out<00:04:00.390> to<00:04:00.690> take<00:04:01.260> each

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.410 
mortars to take them out to take each

no matter what excuse me let's see what

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:28.339 
no matter what excuse me let's see what
we<00:05:23.009> got<00:05:23.159> here<00:05:26.389> so<00:05:27.389> I<00:05:27.419> threw<00:05:27.689> down<00:05:27.779> two<00:05:28.020> mortars

00:05:28.339 --> 00:05:28.349 
we got here so I threw down two mortars

00:05:28.349 --> 00:05:30.800 
we got here so I threw down two mortars
I<00:05:28.819> remember<00:05:29.819> those<00:05:29.939> are<00:05:30.060> called<00:05:30.210> artillery's

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:30.810 
I remember those are called artillery's

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:33.680 
I remember those are called artillery's
I<00:05:30.840> think<00:05:31.199> took<00:05:32.069> down<00:05:32.340> both<00:05:33.120> those<00:05:33.360> defense

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:33.690 
I think took down both those defense

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:35.570 
I think took down both those defense
units<00:05:33.990> and<00:05:34.139> we<00:05:35.039> got<00:05:35.159> these<00:05:35.250> flamethrowers

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:35.580 
units and we got these flamethrowers

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:38.119 
units and we got these flamethrowers
here<00:05:36.150> I<00:05:36.300> was<00:05:36.810> always<00:05:37.169> so<00:05:37.529> afraid<00:05:37.710> of<00:05:37.919> these

00:05:38.119 --> 00:05:38.129 
here I was always so afraid of these

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:40.850 
here I was always so afraid of these
things<00:05:38.370> at<00:05:38.639> first<00:05:38.909> um<00:05:39.360> but<00:05:40.289> you<00:05:40.409> know<00:05:40.440> what<00:05:40.710> my

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:40.860 
things at first um but you know what my

00:05:40.860 --> 00:05:44.180 
things at first um but you know what my
warriors<00:05:41.370> do<00:05:41.550> pretty<00:05:41.879> well<00:05:42.150> against<00:05:42.629> them<00:05:43.190> um

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:44.190 
warriors do pretty well against them um

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:48.409
