00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:05.750
 hello hello my friends 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:08.929
 I already have reviews on the channel 

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:11.370
 this semi-automatic machine 

00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:14.040
 which me by the way is not connected to 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:17.880
 plumbing as it is not I pour 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:21.510
 from buckets of water right here in this tank then 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.279
 I squeeze in that tanks but not the essence of flaws 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.980
 such semi-automatic machines 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.609
 Of course they have a plus need to talk about 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.650
 disadvantages this time guys time 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:34.739
 you need to bring water first then 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:38.969
 pour then pour then into a centrifuge 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:40.829
 load to survive linen again 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:44.940
 in the water pour it all spent 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:47.760
 time which time unfortunately not so 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.829
 a lot of modern man of course 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.660
 if you are a pensioner in either 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:55.140
 vacation somewhere in the country that you 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:57.930
 as a workout water brought on 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.719
 hallelujah all this of course is cute all this but 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.969
 time is spent on use 

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:06.030
 such a car but honestly I’m already here 

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:08.760
 a spoon from about an hour and a half and for these 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.750
 one and a half hours at home automatic car 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:14.520
 worth the extraordinary in it loaded 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.530
 set the time then pulled into the dryer 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.750
 threw everything is not and to this car you 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:21.720
 permanently tied surely would 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:25.229
 big plus if i connect 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:28.110
 when the washing machine has water here 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:30.030
 the corresponding connector there would put 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:32.040
 I mean it’s stuck in a hose somewhere 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.600
 I was lying here and this hose with 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.840
 the other end obeys the crane 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:38.759
 water is poured but we immediately go out 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.159
 minus these washing machines if we 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.500
 let's connect the water for which you will 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.960
 pay if you have free water 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.390
 somewhere for God's sake and if you plant 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:52.100
 you will pay this water supply then this 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:54.450
 the car is not as economical as 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:57.420
 automatic washing machine why 

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:00.750
 here in this tank somewhere breaks 50 liters 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.939
 60 here in this tank you imagine 

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.610
 automatic cars you notice there 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:08.399
 if the load is laundry in the drum then in 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.800
 principle when turn on already wash 

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:13.530
 you will see that there water is dosed as on 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:15.630
 washing and rinsing 

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:18.390
 your linen which is automatic 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.970
 washing machine there 60 liters is not enough 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:23.459
 that does not fit into the drum such 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.350
 60 liters never poured that is 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:27.390
 do not automatically take a washing machine 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:31.319
 water flow as much as necessary 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:34.080
 wash more or less plus not to 

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:37.230
 there was a cold water flow right here and 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:38.970
 beasts can pour 50 60 liters here 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:42.360
 water and imagine if that would be 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:44.790
 water somewhere tap would be in the pipe 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:46.410
 flew you can say well not flown to 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:49.170
 pipe but still costs would be on 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:51.390
 the water is cold and here you need more water 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:55.320
 warm up too minus excuse me then 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:57.470
 have time spent quite a lot 

00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:00.150
 plus you need to heat the water here I take 

00:02:57.470 --> 00:03:03.569
 pouring in a cold water filter stick 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:05.880
 there this water heater is called all 

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:09.510
 teva and heated water then they come here 

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:11.430
 you understand i'm spending time i'm already thinking 

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:13.680
 what was easier on me in auto 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:15.440
 machine wash but in automatic 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.910
 car constantly know the whole family 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:20.280
 erases there constantly goes some 

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:22.140
 scuffling around this automatic 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:24.989
 washing machine and here you loaded 

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:26.760
 calm but when there is time when 

00:03:24.989 --> 00:03:29.790
 I have no time to mess around 

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:31.860
 Well, it is not very convenient, this is also a minus 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:35.970
 that now I will not use in winter 

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:39.120
 because in the same place there is a hose on discharge here 

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:41.579
 here he is here knud there and now i'm 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:44.640
 I'll show you where this hose is 

00:03:41.579 --> 00:03:47.420
 the hose and it breaks out of there now the water 

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:50.640
 and I want to tell you that in the winter of course 

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:52.320
 when the premises here are not and the fuel is not 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.799
 you can of course turn on the heat 

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:56.730
 this cute stove either there 

00:03:54.799 --> 00:04:00.000
 fan heater but not the essence but still 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:02.250
 here the water is constantly in the car there 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.130
 a glass of semi a glass but it remains 

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:07.079
 somewhere in the machine systems and if 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:10.410
 subzero temperature will freeze it all 

00:04:07.079 --> 00:04:13.170
 and the car will come by simple saying khan 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:17.370
 that is, we do not heat the room 

00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:19.530
 keep this machine on all the time 

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:21.940
 especially when it's already -10 I'm not 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:24.910
 I'm talking about minus 20-30 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:27.250
 there is such a pleasant little 8 such 

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:28.290
 cons ie summing up time 

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:31.780
 takes away 

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:33.280
 plus I don't know if it would be a minus 

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:34.900
 you stood in the apartment a lot there 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:37.210
 tap water to this addiction 

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:39.670
 Coco you pour and pour me hunting 

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:42.850
 a lot for some reason plus in the cold 

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:45.160
 time of year would have searched this minus later 

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:46.840
 constantly in the cold season and and 

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:48.490
 when at minus temperature and 

00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:50.800
 use if your premises are not 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:52.450
 heat this is minus plus more 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:54.490
 constantly need to this machine something 

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:56.410
 pour when the carrier feeder pour 

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:59.050
 turn off switch well and so in 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:02.550
 principle on this to the country such a machine 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:02.550
 Hello, my friends
