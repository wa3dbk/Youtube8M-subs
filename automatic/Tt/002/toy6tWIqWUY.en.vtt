00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:37.310 
giving the r8 e-tron a sound that

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.029 
giving the r8 e-tron a sound that
clearly<00:01:37.729> identifies<00:01:38.539> it<00:01:38.899> as<00:01:39.020> an<00:01:39.350> electronic

00:01:40.029 --> 00:01:40.039

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:49.440 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:53.610 

this<00:01:50.440> is<00:01:50.830> what<00:01:51.340> the<00:01:51.460> ADI<00:01:51.760> r8<00:01:52.450> e-tron<00:01:52.720> sounds

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:53.620 
this is what the ADI r8 e-tron sounds

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:56.820 
this is what the ADI r8 e-tron sounds
like<00:01:53.830> on<00:01:54.130> the<00:01:54.610> road
