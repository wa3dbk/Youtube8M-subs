00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
killed once out of the car but I think

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.059

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
if you have an armored carrying with all

00:02:10.339 --> 00:02:10.349 
those reinforcements around the car it

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:11.900 
those reinforcements around the car it
should<00:02:10.440> be<00:02:10.619> much<00:02:10.830> harder<00:02:11.069> to<00:02:11.160> kill<00:02:11.459> you<00:02:11.640> if<00:02:11.819> you

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:11.910 
should be much harder to kill you if you

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
should be much harder to kill you if you
do<00:02:12.030> the<00:02:12.150> glitch<00:02:12.330> with<00:02:12.569> it

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930
