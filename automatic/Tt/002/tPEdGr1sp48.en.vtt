00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.580
 hello to everyone that this shy this 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:07.379
 combines episode of snap shot fava made 

00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:09.120
 yes the frame between lallero 11 point 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:10.530
 I will explain to you next 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.030
 episode is more why 

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.009
 stop recording so many episodes that 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.230
 I am not less than I am above all 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.760
 create a calendar on gmail ie su 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:20.189
 which on google applications to understand 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.039
 where I had to go the videos is a 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:26.029
 casino let alone 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:29.160
 then snap shot trani cv 39 what it is 

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:32.189
 changed they added a new block 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.250
 maybe some setting but the thing 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:38.320
 main who usually have so many bugs 

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:40.060
 have fixed many bugs and 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.730
 nothing this let's send show 

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:45.250
 this and biome of the extreme I know 

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:47.250
 apparently they added a block 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:51.100
 added a block which is the block 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:53.410
 of red sand so we can create 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.870
 naruto sand village no 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:58.059
 that's the sense more or less no ok 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:02.440
 I was obviously joking I was 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:07.690
 simply joking sand with the 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:10.270
 reddish texture other thing 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:13.539
 when I click on super sexy gate 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:18.190
 settings should make me the settings 

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:21.369
 the shaders make me think they were 

00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:23.710
 some added only that still are not 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:26.940
 visible because when I click sometimes 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:32.560
 the completely black screen appears 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:37.979
 it just looks so let's see 

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:37.979
 black screen I click change continuously 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.039
 black screen black screen 

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:54.100
 and so in short it is good to know that not 

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:57.310
 I know but I don't care what the is 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:02:00.580
 his from his hotels solved a case of 

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:03.190
 bug apparently because the title of 

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:07.180
 nerbon so we trust and stay 

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:09.940
 working on some of the structures and 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:12.630
 let's say structures as I can 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:16.090
 explain it practically they will put 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:18.580
 of the east of the structures for example i 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:21.370
 jungle times the chat le 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:23.620
 fortresses similar to those talking but in 

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:28.000
 around all the biomes to give some 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:34.330
 more than exploration awards that 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:37.739
 what was the success with these sheep that 

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.739
 cool with horses 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:46.660
 in the white oil spots i 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.660
 cookies 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:54.800
 I don't think he has reached other blocks 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:03:00.500
 because I would have heard more than one 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:02.660
 web plus web by making structures 

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:05.150
 structures and maybe even some others 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:07.790
 idiom we would have it next week 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:09.560
 this week the group of 

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:11.750
 of young love has also gone into 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:16.370
 Japan type for some event not 

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:17.990
 I know something like that and so I do it 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:20.990
 Today's sale this week 

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:27.290
 I should say it's really really more 

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:30.290
 brought to the problem of solving bugs 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:32.870
 for those who did n't know it when you to you 

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:37.420
 crasha minecraft a bug appears 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:37.420
 very strange because all the black horses 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:48.620
 stuck absurdly there is a cow 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:52.040
 dies when you find a bug you can 

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:53.600
 go and bring it back to the mojang that the 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:55.580
 Minecraft manufacturer came to 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:58.070
 home but now you are from a home 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:01.550
 producer we could say go there is 

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:04.970
 you can simply bring yours back 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:08.810
 balbi and most likely will be elected 

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:11.030
 by one of the programmers if not of it 

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:17.180
 same jarred but jabber corn takes up more 

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:20.090
 of mobile in depends on the money could 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:21.890
 to be fixed they did it on purpose 

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:24.080
 so it costs nothing to use it 

00:04:21.890 --> 00:04:24.590
 used in his but what i am 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.110
 doing 

00:04:24.590 --> 00:04:31.580
 and if to this question two rockets this 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:38.380
 tutorial how to build a pyramid from 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:43.780
 more or less there are not many others 

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:46.220
 information the thing is that it is missing 1.7 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:48.020
 will come out between no less type of two 

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:52.070
 weeks as you know the next 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:54.800
 so I am not here so week 

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:59.900
 They should also have increased the type 

00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:02.390
 power of the mit mappa thing with the 

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:05.120
 active shaders I can't determine 

00:05:02.390 --> 00:05:10.070
 if this was a fucking texture me 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:12.550
 I would take nothing for me 

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:14.630
 only shader fingers, however, is entrusted to you 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:19.850
 so for this video and everything was 

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:21.260
 just to inform you of the training 

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:26.020
 given how I'm doing every week 

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:26.020
