00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:48.680 
that you take one or two I'll take two
or<00:02:45.840> three<00:02:45.960> of<00:02:46.320> these<00:02:47.130> figures<00:02:47.850> back<00:02:48.180> then<00:02:48.390> look

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
or three of these figures back then look

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.470 
or three of these figures back then look
at<00:02:48.840> the<00:02:48.960> detail<00:02:49.140> on<00:02:49.620> the<00:02:50.370> belt<00:02:50.610> and<00:02:51.150> on<00:02:51.360> the

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
at the detail on the belt and on the

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.200 
at the detail on the belt and on the
face<00:02:51.750> and<00:02:52.170> some<00:02:53.040> parts<00:02:53.370> of<00:02:53.430> the<00:02:53.490> boots<00:02:53.760> and<00:02:54.030> and

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:54.210 
face and some parts of the boots and and

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:56.390 
face and some parts of the boots and and
arms<00:02:54.870> and<00:02:55.110> just<00:02:55.350> see<00:02:55.530> the<00:02:55.710> pain<00:02:55.920> quality

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
arms and just see the pain quality

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.770 
arms and just see the pain quality
because<00:02:56.700> some<00:02:56.880> figures<00:02:57.150> are<00:02:57.300> really<00:02:57.540> good

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
because some figures are really good

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.860 
because some figures are really good
some<00:02:58.560> have<00:02:58.770> a<00:02:59.040> lot<00:02:59.220> of<00:02:59.250> overlapping<00:02:59.940> paint<00:03:00.630> job

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:00.870 
some have a lot of overlapping paint job

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.430 
some have a lot of overlapping paint job
but<00:03:01.170> nevertheless<00:03:02.480> the<00:03:03.480> the<00:03:04.050> Star<00:03:04.290> Wars

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:04.440 
but nevertheless the the Star Wars

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.060 
but nevertheless the the Star Wars
figures<00:03:04.740> are<00:03:05.070> still<00:03:05.720> one<00:03:06.720> of<00:03:06.840> Hasbro's<00:03:07.410> better

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:08.070 
figures are still one of Hasbro's better

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:11.120 
figures are still one of Hasbro's better
toy<00:03:08.340> lines<00:03:08.640> in<00:03:08.850> terms<00:03:09.030> of<00:03:09.120> paint<00:03:09.390> quality<00:03:10.130> so

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130 
toy lines in terms of paint quality so

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
toy lines in terms of paint quality so
he<00:03:11.700> does<00:03:11.940> have<00:03:12.150> a<00:03:12.620> sort<00:03:13.620> of<00:03:13.680> light<00:03:13.980> blue<00:03:15.590> aqua

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:17.150 
he does have a sort of light blue aqua

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:22.400 
he does have a sort of light blue aqua
translucent<00:03:18.150> alcohol<00:03:18.680> lightsaber<00:03:19.680> I<00:03:21.350> think<00:03:22.350> a

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410 
translucent alcohol lightsaber I think a

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.830 
translucent alcohol lightsaber I think a
lot<00:03:22.560> of<00:03:22.590> the<00:03:22.710> concept<00:03:23.250> art<00:03:23.460> figures<00:03:23.850> yield<00:03:24.690> a

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
lot of the concept art figures yield a

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.550 
lot of the concept art figures yield a
lighter<00:03:25.050> shade<00:03:25.200> of<00:03:25.500> light<00:03:26.160> sabers<00:03:26.670> I<00:03:27.560> don't

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
lighter shade of light sabers I don't

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.290 
lighter shade of light sabers I don't
know<00:03:28.620> the<00:03:28.890> rooks<00:03:29.370> are<00:03:29.520> over<00:03:29.790> in<00:03:29.880> a<00:03:29.940> darker

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:30.300 
know the rooks are over in a darker

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:33.140 
know the rooks are over in a darker
shade<00:03:30.470> but<00:03:31.470> I<00:03:32.010> like<00:03:32.490> this<00:03:32.670> look<00:03:32.940> on

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:33.150 
shade but I like this look on

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.000 
shade but I like this look on
ki-adi-mundi<00:03:33.630> looking<00:03:34.470> him<00:03:34.620> look<00:03:34.800> a<00:03:34.830> little

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010 
ki-adi-mundi looking him look a little

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:38.750 
ki-adi-mundi looking him look a little
bit<00:03:35.190> tough<00:03:36.740> really<00:03:37.740> makes<00:03:38.280> him<00:03:38.430> look<00:03:38.550> like<00:03:38.670> a

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:38.760 
bit tough really makes him look like a

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.260 
bit tough really makes him look like a
formidable<00:03:39.060> Jedi<00:03:39.600> and<00:03:40.280> I'm<00:03:41.280> glad<00:03:41.490> I<00:03:41.610> got<00:03:42.090> him

highly recommend this figure if even if
you're<00:04:21.930> not

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.200 
you're not

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:25.190 
you're not

have<00:04:25.380> to<00:04:25.590> get<00:04:25.770> I<00:04:26.070> figure<00:04:26.940> from<00:04:27.120> this<00:04:27.360> wave<00:04:27.570> this

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:28.350 
have to get I figure from this wave this

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:31.010 
have to get I figure from this wave this
is<00:04:28.500> probably<00:04:28.770> the<00:04:28.920> one<00:04:29.100> you<00:04:29.220> want<00:04:29.370> to<00:04:29.430> get<00:04:30.020> very

is probably the one you want to get very
nice<00:04:31.380> just<00:04:31.920> I'm<00:04:32.700> just<00:04:33.030> blown<00:04:33.600> away<00:04:33.660> at<00:04:34.410> this

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 
nice just I'm just blown away at this

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:39.520 
nice just I'm just blown away at this
concept<00:04:35.130> art<00:04:35.340> and<00:04:35.520> I<00:04:35.610> wish<00:04:35.820> the<00:04:36.690> movie<00:04:36.840> had<00:04:37.230> or

concept art and I wish the movie had or
the<00:04:40.940> cartoon<00:04:41.940> or<00:04:42.270> the<00:04:42.540> movie<00:04:42.960> had<00:04:43.140> actually

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:45.110 
the cartoon or the movie had actually

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:47.870 
the cartoon or the movie had actually
made<00:04:46.110> it<00:04:46.380> made<00:04:46.680> ciotti<00:04:47.070> we<00:04:47.250> need<00:04:47.400> to<00:04:47.520> look<00:04:47.640> like

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:47.880 
made it made ciotti we need to look like

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:50.840 
made it made ciotti we need to look like
this<00:04:48.590> perhaps<00:04:49.590> in<00:04:49.770> your<00:04:49.800> veg<00:04:50.070> of<00:04:50.220> the<00:04:50.340> Sith<00:04:50.580> and

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:50.850 
this perhaps in your veg of the Sith and

00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:55.760 
this perhaps in your veg of the Sith and
then<00:04:51.000> I<00:04:53.120> don't<00:04:54.120> know<00:04:54.210> he'd<00:04:55.080> look<00:04:55.290> awesome<00:04:55.650> i

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:55.770 
then I don't know he'd look awesome i

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:59.060 
then I don't know he'd look awesome i
guess<00:04:56.190> but<00:04:57.140> sadly<00:04:58.140> we<00:04:58.230> didn't<00:04:58.410> see<00:04:58.560> him<00:04:58.650> in<00:04:58.950> the

00:04:59.060 --> 00:04:59.070 
guess but sadly we didn't see him in the

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:01.190 
guess but sadly we didn't see him in the
movie<00:04:59.370> looking<00:04:59.850> like<00:05:00.000> this<00:05:00.210> so<00:05:00.960> there<00:05:01.110> you

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:01.200 
movie looking like this so there you

00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:05.110 
movie looking like this so there you
have<00:05:01.230> it<00:05:01.350> the<00:05:02.300> Star<00:05:03.300> Wars<00:05:03.540> legacy<00:05:04.410> collection

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:05.120 
have it the Star Wars legacy collection

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:08.150
