have<00:02:44.610> a<00:02:44.640> skull<00:02:44.910> so<00:02:45.060> if<00:02:45.150> they<00:02:45.240> don't<00:02:45.390> have<00:02:45.480> a

but that's few and far between as far as
we<00:02:59.070> know<00:03:00.110> but<00:03:01.460> this<00:03:02.460> this<00:03:03.000> causes<00:03:03.450> some

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:03.660 
we know but this this causes some

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.080 
we know but this this causes some

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
problems because well the parasites

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:10.100 
problems because well the parasites
catch<00:03:06.450> on<00:03:06.690> and<00:03:07.050> and<00:03:07.890> be<00:03:08.280> it<00:03:08.700> starts<00:03:09.420> causing<00:03:09.600> a

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
little bit of chaos because when they

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:14.870 
little bit of chaos because when they
killed<00:03:13.830> the<00:03:13.950> first<00:03:14.130> parasite<00:03:14.610> when<00:03:14.790> they

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:14.880 
killed the first parasite when they

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.760 
killed the first parasite when they
spotted<00:03:15.090> what<00:03:15.450> they<00:03:15.660> presumed<00:03:16.110> to<00:03:16.290> be<00:03:16.470> a

off the bat that that they don't care

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:30.590 
off the bat that that they don't care
like<00:03:28.980> sure<00:03:29.760> maybe<00:03:30.090> she<00:03:30.270> could<00:03:30.390> have<00:03:30.480> been

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:34.770 
to kill us you would think that that

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:35.870 
to kill us you would think that that
would<00:05:34.890> kind<00:05:35.130> of<00:05:35.160> run<00:05:35.310> through<00:05:35.370> their<00:05:35.580> head<00:05:35.730> but

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:35.880

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:38.180 
would kind of run through their head but
now<00:05:36.030> it<00:05:36.420> didn't<00:05:36.720> it<00:05:37.290> didn't<00:05:37.650> it<00:05:37.830> didn't<00:05:38.130> make

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:38.190 
now it didn't it didn't it didn't make

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:41.090 
now it didn't it didn't it didn't make
sense<00:05:38.250> um<00:05:38.640> so<00:05:39.210> he<00:05:39.510> destroys<00:05:39.750> all<00:05:39.960> of<00:05:40.020> them<00:05:40.290> with

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:41.100 
sense um so he destroys all of them with

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:43.340 
sense um so he destroys all of them with
their<00:05:41.280> own<00:05:41.340> bullets<00:05:41.730> shoots<00:05:42.540> all<00:05:42.990> their<00:05:43.260> own

bullets<00:05:43.590> back<00:05:43.860> at<00:05:44.040> them<00:05:44.190> which<00:05:44.340> is<00:05:44.460> pretty

00:05:44.630 --> 00:05:44.640 
bullets back at them which is pretty
