00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:12.630

 I have the hair old and the whole 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.769
 have victoria's secret models theme 

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.960
 try to get loose to his to this 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.869
 beautiful soft waves and a 

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:33.030
 major which I like very much so one 

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:35.430
 Kindly know your colors red 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.950
 but very much yes, I think so 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.960
 just a lot of fun with the video going on 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.989
 she gives the make up and I'm one 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:46.980
 very light glory foundation the me 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:50.879
 the fingers but only a little on pots 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:54.960
 and then only where I apply 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:56.550
 so to speak problems have on the 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.670
 I always have a few small ones 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:01.129
 pimples here in front for the audio 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.110
 shadow now an extra helping 

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:05.010
 concealer so that too put away 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:06.840
 are 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.870
 and when not yet reflect that 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:13.230
 but to save the powder again from the 

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:15.210
 fondation and all the lyrics 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:17.490
 to shine more radiant 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.370
 I keep my eyes relatively simple 

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:23.250
 use two colors once a beautiful one 

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:24.720
 warm champagne cream tone and then 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.160
 another eggplant I think so 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.040
 Eggplant happens very nicely in the 

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:32.580
 autumn winter and suits many 

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:36.060
 skin types 100 first the shimmer toni 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:41.970
 speech but this beautiful kÃ¼mmerling on 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:43.680
 the song comes to open the view 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:48.750
 Also here in this angle the 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:50.610
 color beauty top down big 

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.830
 fluffy pense now in eggplant tone 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.610
 in the eyelet give to come up 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.760
 downward 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:59.160
 your mirror and I do so one 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.870
 combination of light winds in 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:04.680
 circling movements so that you 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:08.160
 not the puff and he does but already 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.480
 Nice one works so reddish 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:12.810
 eyeshadows should definitely be on 

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:15.480
 combine with an eyeliner and to do so 

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:20.239
 I take now to the brush and a 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:23.010
 brother eyeshadow just wear it 

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:24.420
 could also take liquid nylander 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.120
 but I like the brothers a bit 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:29.959
 deeper because then 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:32.900
 a natural one so deluded 

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:37.940
 and quite a lot 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:42.129
 Mascara's eyebrows will last honey 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:46.549
 even with a pen just so small 

00:02:42.129 --> 00:02:49.489
 striche lay movements in the 

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:50.959
 eyebrows and now I want to 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:53.030
 a little bit of color back to the face 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:56.180
 because we're honest right now 

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:59.209
 Just like a ghost, it just shows me and me 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:03:00.519
 start small at first with a bit 

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:04.489
 kettering bronze 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:07.569
 below my bones to give that 

00:03:04.489 --> 00:03:07.569
 to compete 

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:15.730
 and a pink blush number 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:17.590
 nice the color back to the weight I 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.890
 I do not use a browser now 

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.840
 such a victoria secrets look 

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:24.609
 bronze place in all cases 

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:27.040
 and why used in winter shows 

00:03:24.609 --> 00:03:29.650
 the industry but my basic skin color 

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.959
 is currently so bright that's just 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:35.139
 of course that would mean today 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:39.280
 Although there is a pale face autumn 

00:03:35.139 --> 00:03:43.950
 variant and then another circuit 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:43.950
 little pink is on the lips 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.189
 on we go with the hard I have it 

00:03:46.689 --> 00:03:50.109
 me here on average seemed made because 

00:03:48.189 --> 00:03:51.700
 second most victoria secret 

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:54.099
 So mid-peaks have a slight 

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:56.290
 side vertex and around the whole now 

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:58.629
 easier to do because we try 

00:03:56.290 --> 00:04:00.760
 us today at this wonderful great 

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:05.019
 perfect waves which was mine 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:07.719
 turn away side and here the top 

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:09.340
 Just play with it 

00:04:07.719 --> 00:04:14.919
 makes it a bit easier because I have so 

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:16.959
 Many hair and body longer is 

00:04:14.919 --> 00:04:18.459
 Start by blowing it through again 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:20.739
 really no knots are in there 

00:04:18.459 --> 00:04:22.780
 Hair is completely dry, too 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:25.000
 if you have your hair login this is one 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:27.190
 then be bit over wet then game over 

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.110
 they will go out again and 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:30.130
 In addition, for the hold now takes 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:31.720
 even cases that is the 

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:33.909
 at the same time that has to protect 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:37.080
 you can become both in a year 

00:04:33.909 --> 00:04:39.460
 Protects and the curls hold better 

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:40.979
 and in lotte we did not die using that 

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:44.320
 is the deepest 

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:49.139
 it 's a relatively big one and I put it 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:49.139
 now the hair around 

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:57.540
 so and then the brace on it 

00:04:55.530 --> 00:05:01.860
 press a little to one approach 

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:05.670
 and just let it clip then 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:07.710
 and I give the people in there 

00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:13.260
 my hand and runs first so 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:15.390
 bit cool and the reason to go in 

00:05:13.260 --> 00:05:19.020
 something bigger curling iron is that me 

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:20.670
 just nice big voluminous waves 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:24.270
 want to have and no defined 

00:05:20.670 --> 00:05:26.250
 lure it there is always important how 

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:29.130
 her hair on bell city brings 

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:31.170
 if the hairs know so 1 turns while 

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:35.520
 your on the curling iron then do 

00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:37.920
 Do you get it so tight? 

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:39.750
 and if you are trying it relatively smooth 

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:42.630
 or curler to get gets her 

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:45.780
 he nice waves of that exactly 

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:49.530
 I try now wisps again 

00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:51.510
 I take all in one 

00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:52.950
 direction then all back then 

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:55.530
 connect them then have the same 

00:05:52.950 --> 00:05:58.400
 Better to read the novels if you want more 

00:05:55.530 --> 00:06:01.290
 volume then you want the synonymous 

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:03.240
 further back to the back at the 

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:06.030
 front strands now makes that way 

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:10.740
 I do not use the brace the hair 

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:13.230
 only very loosely wrapped around the bar gentleman 

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:16.560
 because the facial parts I want 

00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:19.020
 just have a bit of janosa so 

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:20.820
 that they do not bring so strong 

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:22.169
 but that they are simply one 

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:24.840
 nice light balls have that 

00:06:22.169 --> 00:06:28.310
 face played well and now need 

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:28.310
 we still have a lot of hairspray 

00:06:30.009 --> 00:06:34.880
 we now have our rest bells 

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:37.569
 So, so to speak, the form is there but you 

00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:41.150
 also look very made and 

00:06:37.569 --> 00:06:44.300
 I use a soft one 

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:45.470
 Hair brush could do it too 

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:48.740
 make a fuss 

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:51.620
 That's how it became for me 

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:53.210
 everything comes together at the lump 

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:55.310
 Of course, step out a bit and 

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:57.800
 if you want to have an angel and 

00:06:55.310 --> 00:07:00.050
 there small then us just small 

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:03.800
 curling iron I make this print like it 

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:06.650
 Now, of course, looks like 

00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:09.250
 and you have to move in the hair when I have it 

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:11.449
 now too flat is so combed out then 

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:13.159
 I always do that so I'm single 

00:07:11.449 --> 00:07:17.240
 just take it easy again 

00:07:13.159 --> 00:07:21.080
 from the baker and then just around 

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:23.780
 put the curling iron around again 

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:28.250
 house just here claim the area 

00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:29.930
 that that fits nicely so if you want 

00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:31.940
 can you in upper computer a bit 

00:07:29.930 --> 00:07:34.280
 to copy but I really like that 

00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:35.659
 that it said a bit platter above 

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:38.780

00:07:35.659 --> 00:07:40.190
