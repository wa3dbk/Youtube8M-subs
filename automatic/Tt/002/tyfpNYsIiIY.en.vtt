double crochet by wrapping my yarn

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.219 
double crochet by wrapping my yarn
around<00:01:13.770> my<00:01:14.460> hook<00:01:14.760> now<00:01:15.390> that<00:01:15.570> movement<00:01:16.080> is

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
you may need to actually wrap it around

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.969 
you may need to actually wrap it around
like<00:01:21.240> this<00:01:21.570> until<00:01:21.840> you<00:01:22.350> get<00:01:22.560> all<00:01:22.799> the

like this until you get all the
movements<00:01:23.520> it<00:01:23.700> just<00:01:24.240> takes<00:01:24.509> practice<00:01:24.810> so

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
movements it just takes practice so

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
into that chain and what you'll see is

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.149 
into that chain and what you'll see is
it<00:01:35.340> has<00:01:35.369> one<00:01:36.060> loop<00:01:36.570> or<00:01:36.810> one<00:01:37.020> bar<00:01:37.290> over<00:01:37.770> the<00:01:37.890> top

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009 
double crochet so this is the stitch

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:10.490 
double crochet so this is the stitch
I've<00:02:08.220> actually<00:02:08.459> just<00:02:08.729> worked<00:02:09.239> into<00:02:09.690> so<00:02:10.140> I<00:02:10.170> want

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:10.500 
I've actually just worked into so I want

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.020 
I've actually just worked into so I want
to<00:02:10.590> work<00:02:10.770> into<00:02:11.069> the<00:02:11.220> next<00:02:11.580> stitch<00:02:11.730> which<00:02:12.000> is

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
to work into the next stitch which is

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:13.050 
to work into the next stitch which is
right<00:02:12.450> here

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
right here

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.110 
right here
so<00:02:13.840> to<00:02:14.260> start<00:02:14.650> we<00:02:15.400> want<00:02:15.550> to<00:02:15.700> wrap<00:02:15.880> our<00:02:16.090> yarn

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
so to start we want to wrap our yarn

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:20.220 
so to start we want to wrap our yarn
around<00:02:16.750> or<00:02:16.959> hook<00:02:17.760> place<00:02:18.760> our<00:02:19.030> hook<00:02:19.270> through

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
around or hook place our hook through

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.430 
around or hook place our hook through
that<00:02:21.010> stitch<00:02:21.550> you<00:02:22.540> can<00:02:22.600> kind<00:02:22.959> of<00:02:23.020> see<00:02:23.170> it<00:02:23.260> looks

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
that stitch you can kind of see it looks

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.160 
that stitch you can kind of see it looks
like<00:02:23.650> three<00:02:24.010> loops<00:02:24.250> on<00:02:24.459> my<00:02:24.520> hook<00:02:24.700> I<00:02:25.240> want<00:02:26.110> to

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
like three loops on my hook I want to

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:29.550 
like three loops on my hook I want to
wrap<00:02:26.380> my<00:02:26.620> yarn<00:02:26.650> around<00:02:27.220> my<00:02:27.819> hook<00:02:28.240> and<00:02:28.420> draw<00:02:29.290> up

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
wrap my yarn around my hook and draw up

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.490 
wrap my yarn around my hook and draw up
a<00:02:29.739> loop<00:02:29.980> so<00:02:30.940> there<00:02:31.150> we<00:02:31.330> are<00:02:31.360> we<00:02:31.780> now<00:02:31.930> have<00:02:32.170> three

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
a loop so there we are we now have three

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.970 
a loop so there we are we now have three
loops<00:02:32.739> on<00:02:33.040> our<00:02:33.100> hook<00:02:33.280> I<00:02:34.470> want<00:02:35.470> to<00:02:35.560> wrap<00:02:35.709> my<00:02:35.950> yarn

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
loops on our hook I want to wrap my yarn

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.240 
loops on our hook I want to wrap my yarn
around<00:02:36.489> my<00:02:36.970> hook<00:02:37.360> and<00:02:37.680> pull<00:02:38.680> it<00:02:38.709> through<00:02:38.860> all

around my hook and pull it through all

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.059 
around my hook and pull it through all
three<00:02:39.310> of<00:02:40.270> those<00:02:40.510> loops<00:02:40.989> and<00:02:41.319> that's<00:02:41.770> your

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:42.069 
three of those loops and that's your

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:45.540 
three of those loops and that's your
second<00:02:42.459> half<00:02:42.670> double<00:02:43.090> crochet<00:02:43.980> so<00:02:44.980> here<00:02:45.250> we<00:02:45.400> go

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550 
second half double crochet so here we go

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:47.580 
second half double crochet so here we go
that's<00:02:45.940> the<00:02:46.180> stitch<00:02:46.510> I've<00:02:46.720> worked<00:02:46.959> into<00:02:47.320> and

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
that's the stitch I've worked into and

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.199 
that's the stitch I've worked into and
this<00:02:47.800> is<00:02:47.980> the<00:02:48.130> next<00:02:48.400> stitch<00:02:48.580> I<00:02:48.730> want<00:02:48.970> to<00:02:49.060> work

00:02:49.199 --> 00:02:49.209

00:02:57.509 --> 00:02:57.519 
your hook place it into your stitch wrap

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:01.530 
your hook place it into your stitch wrap
my<00:02:57.760> yarn<00:02:57.790> around<00:02:58.239> my<00:02:58.630> hook<00:02:59.790> draw<00:03:00.790> up<00:03:01.120> a<00:03:01.300> loop

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
my yarn around my hook draw up a loop

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.660 
my yarn around my hook draw up a loop
and<00:03:01.750> now<00:03:02.230> you<00:03:02.290> have<00:03:02.680> three<00:03:02.950> loops<00:03:03.069> on<00:03:03.580> your

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:03.670 
and now you have three loops on your

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:07.640 
and now you have three loops on your
hook<00:03:03.970> wrap<00:03:04.739> my<00:03:05.739> yarn<00:03:05.769> around<00:03:06.310> my<00:03:06.640> hook<00:03:07.030> and

hook wrap my yarn around my hook and
pull<00:03:08.650> it<00:03:08.680> through<00:03:08.890> all<00:03:09.640> of<00:03:09.760> those<00:03:10.569> loops<00:03:10.930> and<00:03:11.080> I

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:11.350 
pull it through all of those loops and I

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:12.809 
pull it through all of those loops and I
promise<00:03:11.830> with<00:03:12.010> some<00:03:12.190> practice<00:03:12.580> those

00:03:12.809 --> 00:03:12.819 
promise with some practice those

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:14.910 
promise with some practice those
movements<00:03:13.360> will<00:03:13.510> get<00:03:13.690> much<00:03:13.930> smoother<00:03:14.739> and

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:14.920 
movements will get much smoother and

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:17.640 
movements will get much smoother and
much<00:03:15.040> easier<00:03:15.900> so<00:03:16.900> here<00:03:17.140> we<00:03:17.260> go<00:03:17.350> I'm<00:03:17.470> going<00:03:17.620> to

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:17.650 
much easier so here we go I'm going to

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.940 
much easier so here we go I'm going to
work<00:03:17.829> the<00:03:18.010> last<00:03:18.310> stitch<00:03:18.730> into<00:03:19.209> my<00:03:19.390> row<00:03:19.860> want<00:03:20.860> to

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:32.470 
hook and draw up a loop I now have three

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:36.210 
hook and draw up a loop I now have three
loops<00:03:32.739> on<00:03:33.040> my<00:03:33.070> hook<00:03:34.019> wrap<00:03:35.019> my<00:03:35.290> yarn<00:03:35.320> around<00:03:35.860> my

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:44.190 
hook and pull it through all three loops
and<00:03:41.260> there<00:03:42.250> we<00:03:42.430> go<00:03:42.609> so<00:03:43.269> if<00:03:43.329> I<00:03:43.420> cover<00:03:43.780> hold<00:03:44.049> it

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:44.200 
and there we go so if I cover hold it

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:46.110 
and there we go so if I cover hold it
like<00:03:44.380> this<00:03:44.410> you<00:03:44.620> can<00:03:44.829> see<00:03:45.220> here's<00:03:45.579> my<00:03:45.790> four

like this you can see here's my four
stitches<00:03:46.290> one<00:03:47.290> two<00:03:47.760> three<00:03:48.760> four<00:03:49.450> those<00:03:50.109> are

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:50.320 
stitches one two three four those are

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:53.039 
stitches one two three four those are
the<00:03:50.410> missed<00:03:50.680> chains<00:03:51.130> that<00:03:52.000> we<00:03:52.209> skipped<00:03:52.720> and

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:53.049 
the missed chains that we skipped and

00:03:53.049 --> 00:03:54.780 
the missed chains that we skipped and
that's<00:03:53.500> to<00:03:53.739> give<00:03:53.890> the<00:03:54.070> row<00:03:54.220> a<00:03:54.250> little<00:03:54.459> bit<00:03:54.700> of

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:54.790 
that's to give the row a little bit of

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:56.490 
that's to give the row a little bit of
height<00:03:54.970> but<00:03:55.239> this<00:03:55.510> is<00:03:55.660> actually<00:03:56.109> your<00:03:56.230> four

do<00:04:00.850> we<00:04:00.940> do<00:04:01.090> when<00:04:01.269> we<00:04:01.359> get<00:04:01.480> to<00:04:01.660> our<00:04:01.750> next<00:04:01.870> row<00:04:02.140> so

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:02.709 
do we do when we get to our next row so

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:06.150 
do we do when we get to our next row so
we<00:04:02.859> turn<00:04:03.100> our<00:04:03.340> work<00:04:04.140> and<00:04:05.140> what<00:04:05.350> we<00:04:05.500> want<00:04:05.769> to<00:04:05.890> do

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:10.890 
to start our half double crochets is
your<00:04:09.070> pattern<00:04:09.250> nose<00:04:09.549> tell<00:04:09.820> you<00:04:10.060> to<00:04:10.239> chain<00:04:10.570> two

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:10.900 
your pattern nose tell you to chain two

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:16.740 
your pattern nose tell you to chain two
so<00:04:11.560> to<00:04:11.620> chain<00:04:12.660> we<00:04:13.660> want<00:04:13.959> to<00:04:14.519> have<00:04:15.519> our<00:04:15.790> yarn

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:16.750 
so to chain we want to have our yarn

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:19.080 
so to chain we want to have our yarn
around<00:04:16.989> our<00:04:17.380> hook<00:04:17.620> and<00:04:17.799> draw<00:04:18.760> up<00:04:18.940> a<00:04:19.060> loop

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:19.090 
around our hook and draw up a loop

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:21.719 
around our hook and draw up a loop
that's<00:04:19.539> one<00:04:19.840> chain<00:04:20.169> grab<00:04:20.919> my<00:04:21.070> yarn<00:04:21.310> around<00:04:21.489> my

00:04:21.719 --> 00:04:21.729 
that's one chain grab my yarn around my

00:04:21.729 --> 00:04:25.110 
that's one chain grab my yarn around my
hook<00:04:22.060> and<00:04:23.220> pull<00:04:24.220> it<00:04:24.310> through<00:04:24.340> so<00:04:24.669> that's<00:04:24.909> two

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120 
hook and pull it through so that's two

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:26.640 
hook and pull it through so that's two
chains<00:04:25.419> one<00:04:25.840> two

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:26.650 
chains one two

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:28.980 
chains one two
now<00:04:27.400> your<00:04:27.610> powder<00:04:27.880> will<00:04:28.180> tell<00:04:28.449> you<00:04:28.660> whether

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:28.990 
now your powder will tell you whether

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:31.950 
now your powder will tell you whether
this<00:04:29.440> chain<00:04:30.010> counts<00:04:30.639> as<00:04:30.760> a<00:04:30.790> stitch<00:04:31.240> or<00:04:31.449> not<00:04:31.630> if

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:31.960 
this chain counts as a stitch or not if

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:36.000 
this chain counts as a stitch or not if
it<00:04:32.650> counts<00:04:32.889> as<00:04:33.250> a<00:04:33.280> stitch<00:04:33.790> you<00:04:34.120> want<00:04:35.050> to<00:04:35.260> sort

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:36.010 
it counts as a stitch you want to sort

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:38.400 
it counts as a stitch you want to sort
of<00:04:36.130> count<00:04:36.460> it<00:04:36.639> as<00:04:36.790> this<00:04:37.060> first<00:04:37.479> stitch<00:04:37.870> so<00:04:38.110> this

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:38.410 
of count it as this first stitch so this

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:40.620 
of count it as this first stitch so this
chain<00:04:38.800> would<00:04:39.070> then<00:04:39.250> belong<00:04:39.699> with<00:04:40.000> this<00:04:40.180> stitch

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:40.630 
chain would then belong with this stitch

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:43.170 
chain would then belong with this stitch
so<00:04:41.320> then<00:04:41.470> when<00:04:41.650> it<00:04:41.770> says<00:04:41.979> work<00:04:42.340> into<00:04:42.699> the<00:04:42.820> next

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:43.180 
so then when it says work into the next

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:44.969 
so then when it says work into the next
stitch<00:04:43.360> you'd<00:04:43.630> actually<00:04:44.080> work<00:04:44.350> into<00:04:44.770> this

00:04:44.969 --> 00:04:44.979 
stitch you'd actually work into this

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:48.810 
stitch you'd actually work into this
stitch<00:04:45.310> right<00:04:45.610> here<00:04:46.199> often<00:04:47.199> though<00:04:48.070> your

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:48.820 
stitch right here often though your

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:51.180 
stitch right here often though your
pattern<00:04:49.389> will<00:04:49.570> tell<00:04:49.600> you<00:04:50.080> with<00:04:50.290> a<00:04:50.320> half<00:04:50.680> double

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:51.190 
pattern will tell you with a half double

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:54.629 
pattern will tell you with a half double
crochet<00:04:51.729> that<00:04:52.270> these<00:04:52.660> chain<00:04:53.050> to<00:04:53.350> do<00:04:53.740> not<00:04:54.130> count

draw<00:06:02.320> up<00:06:02.349> a<00:06:02.530> loop<00:06:03.150> wrap<00:06:04.150> it<00:06:04.330> around<00:06:04.449> and<00:06:04.930> pull

00:06:05.129 --> 00:06:05.139 
draw up a loop wrap it around and pull

00:06:05.139 --> 00:06:08.070 
draw up a loop wrap it around and pull
through<00:06:05.320> all<00:06:05.410> three<00:06:06.250> loops<00:06:06.550> and<00:06:06.970> that's<00:06:07.900> all

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:08.080 
through all three loops and that's all

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:10.939 
through all three loops and that's all
there<00:06:08.229> is<00:06:08.260> to<00:06:08.590> making<00:06:08.620> half<00:06:09.130> double<00:06:09.460> crochets

00:06:10.939 --> 00:06:10.949 
there is to making half double crochets

00:06:10.949 --> 00:06:14.640 
there is to making half double crochets
this<00:06:11.949> is<00:06:12.160> what<00:06:12.720> rows<00:06:13.720> of<00:06:14.050> half<00:06:14.260> double

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:14.650 
this is what rows of half double

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:16.770 
this is what rows of half double
crochets<00:06:15.099> look<00:06:15.520> like<00:06:15.820> when<00:06:16.150> you<00:06:16.300> go<00:06:16.479> back<00:06:16.750> and

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:16.780 
crochets look like when you go back and

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:18.900 
crochets look like when you go back and
forth<00:06:17.080> these<00:06:17.440> are<00:06:17.500> all<00:06:17.770> half<00:06:18.099> double<00:06:18.460> crochets

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:18.910 
forth these are all half double crochets

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:21.390 
forth these are all half double crochets
and<00:06:19.210> if<00:06:19.330> I<00:06:19.539> flip<00:06:19.810> this<00:06:20.020> over<00:06:20.320> you'll<00:06:20.919> see<00:06:21.190> that

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:21.400 
and if I flip this over you'll see that

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:23.909 
and if I flip this over you'll see that
it<00:06:21.550> looks<00:06:21.580> basically<00:06:22.180> the<00:06:22.690> same<00:06:22.960> on<00:06:23.289> both

00:06:23.909 --> 00:06:23.919 
it looks basically the same on both

00:06:23.919 --> 00:06:27.510 
it looks basically the same on both
sides<00:06:24.810> so<00:06:25.810> that's<00:06:25.990> all<00:06:26.169> there<00:06:26.260> is<00:06:26.410> to<00:06:26.620> it<00:06:26.830> we'll

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:27.520 
sides so that's all there is to it we'll

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:30.510 
sides so that's all there is to it we'll
