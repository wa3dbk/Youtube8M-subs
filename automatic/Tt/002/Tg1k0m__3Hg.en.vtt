have a chance to catch some fish

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.140 
have a chance to catch some fish
hopefully<00:00:15.960> it's<00:00:16.230> a<00:00:16.710> steelhead<00:00:17.460> and<00:00:17.670> this<00:00:17.910> year

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
hopefully it's a steelhead and this year

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.390 
hopefully it's a steelhead and this year
has<00:00:18.240> been<00:00:18.410> gotten<00:00:19.410> off<00:00:19.560> to<00:00:19.710> a<00:00:19.770> slow<00:00:20.010> start<00:00:20.070> on

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:20.400 
has been gotten off to a slow start on

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.710 
has been gotten off to a slow start on
the<00:00:20.520> snake<00:00:20.760> our<00:00:20.970> water<00:00:21.150> temps<00:00:21.510> have<00:00:21.600> been

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
the snake our water temps have been

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.660 
the snake our water temps have been
higher<00:00:21.900> than<00:00:21.930> normal<00:00:22.320> but<00:00:22.619> if<00:00:22.859> we<00:00:22.980> stay

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:23.670 
higher than normal but if we stay

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:24.980 
higher than normal but if we stay
persistent<00:00:23.880> and<00:00:24.359> keep<00:00:24.480> our<00:00:24.630> heads<00:00:24.779> in<00:00:24.900> the

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:24.990 
persistent and keep our heads in the

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:26.900 
persistent and keep our heads in the
game<00:00:25.140> I<00:00:25.199> think<00:00:25.410> we<00:00:25.710> can<00:00:25.890> at<00:00:26.460> least<00:00:26.670> get<00:00:26.880> a

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.700 
game I think we can at least get a
hookup<00:00:27.269> or<00:00:27.390> two<00:00:27.570> well<00:00:28.199> let's<00:00:28.349> give<00:00:28.529> it<00:00:28.590> a<00:00:28.680> shot

yeah gel has been telling me that being

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.330 
yeah gel has been telling me that being
first<00:03:55.790> through<00:03:56.000> the<00:03:56.090> holes<00:03:56.329> really<00:03:56.659> the<00:03:56.930> best
