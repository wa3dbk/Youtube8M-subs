in<00:01:46.619> here<00:01:46.799> at<00:01:46.920> least<00:01:47.100> they<00:01:47.250> were<00:01:47.310> not<00:01:47.579> for<00:01:47.820> us

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030

Oh to the yeah so we will come back for

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.020 
Oh to the yeah so we will come back for
a<00:02:40.540> lot<00:02:40.690> of<00:02:40.750> these<00:02:40.959> studs<00:02:41.410> in<00:02:41.769> a<00:02:41.950> little<00:02:42.190> bit<00:02:42.370> but

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.030 
a lot of these studs in a little bit but

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:44.340 
a lot of these studs in a little bit but
we're<00:02:43.150> trying<00:02:43.360> to<00:02:43.450> scatter<00:02:43.720> it<00:02:43.840> out<00:02:44.049> a<00:02:44.080> little

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:44.350 
we're trying to scatter it out a little

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:48.800 
we're trying to scatter it out a little
bit<00:02:44.500> so<00:02:44.739> it's<00:02:44.830> not<00:02:44.920> too<00:02:45.250> much<00:02:45.280> of<00:02:45.430> a<00:02:45.670> stud<00:02:45.970> fest

00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:48.810 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.840 

so<00:02:49.810> a<00:02:49.840> couple<00:02:50.260> swoops<00:02:50.590> through<00:02:50.920> here<00:02:51.190> flying

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850 
so a couple swoops through here flying

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:54.300 
so a couple swoops through here flying
surely<00:02:52.390> is<00:02:52.569> a<00:02:52.600> good<00:02:53.290> way<00:02:53.440> to<00:02:53.470> do<00:02:53.769> a<00:02:54.069> lot<00:02:54.250> of

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310 
surely is a good way to do a lot of

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:55.770 
surely is a good way to do a lot of
stuff<00:02:54.580> collecting<00:02:55.000> if<00:02:55.090> you<00:02:55.150> don't<00:02:55.330> have<00:02:55.510> the

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
stuff collecting if you don't have the

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.740 
stuff collecting if you don't have the
stud<00:02:56.260> collector<00:02:56.799> red<00:02:57.519> brick<00:02:57.790> yet<00:02:58.030> stutter

00:02:58.740 --> 00:02:58.750 
stud collector red brick yet stutter

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.430 
stud collector red brick yet stutter

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.440 
tracked that being because it does kind

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.390 
tracked that being because it does kind
of<00:03:02.560> work<00:03:02.769> like<00:03:03.190> the<00:03:03.489> stutter<00:03:04.030> tracked<00:03:05.400> track

after<00:03:23.890> hacking<00:03:24.220> the<00:03:24.459> terminal<00:03:24.910> we<00:03:25.030> did<00:03:25.180> hack

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:25.390 
after hacking the terminal we did hack

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:27.240 
after hacking the terminal we did hack
the<00:03:25.600> terminal<00:03:26.049> but<00:03:26.170> we<00:03:26.380> edited<00:03:26.739> that<00:03:26.980> footage

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:27.250 
the terminal but we edited that footage

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:30.120 
the terminal but we edited that footage
out<00:03:27.900> since<00:03:28.900> in<00:03:29.049> wasting<00:03:29.380> the<00:03:29.470> time<00:03:29.680> bouncing

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.130 
out since in wasting the time bouncing

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:33.390 
out since in wasting the time bouncing
around<00:03:30.329> but<00:03:31.329> once<00:03:31.810> you<00:03:31.930> do<00:03:32.079> completely<00:03:32.590> hack

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
around but once you do completely hack

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.640

start driving on them and it will

00:06:00.229 --> 00:06:02.620 
start driving on them and it will
actually<00:06:00.410> cue<00:06:00.860> a<00:06:00.950> stud<00:06:01.220> trail<00:06:01.490> and<00:06:02.419> then<00:06:02.539> you

actually cue a stud trail and then you

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:05.140 
actually cue a stud trail and then you
follow<00:06:02.870> that<00:06:02.960> trail<00:06:03.349> and<00:06:03.680> you'll<00:06:04.370> find<00:06:04.729> what

follow that trail and you'll find what

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:07.659 
follow that trail and you'll find what
happens<00:06:05.510> to<00:06:05.630> be<00:06:05.720> our<00:06:05.900> last<00:06:06.349> brick<00:06:06.680> because<00:06:06.919> we

00:06:07.659 --> 00:06:07.669 
happens to be our last brick because we

00:06:07.669 --> 00:06:09.879 
happens to be our last brick because we
do<00:06:07.880> hit<00:06:08.479> the<00:06:08.599> million<00:06:08.810> studs<00:06:09.229> here<00:06:09.470> in<00:06:09.590> just<00:06:09.770> a

00:06:09.879 --> 00:06:09.889 
do hit the million studs here in just a

00:06:09.889 --> 00:06:12.010 
do hit the million studs here in just a
second<00:06:10.310> so<00:06:10.490> yeah<00:06:11.300> now<00:06:11.450> that<00:06:11.599> I'm<00:06:11.690> getting<00:06:11.810> more

00:06:12.010 --> 00:06:12.020 
second so yeah now that I'm getting more

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:13.600 
second so yeah now that I'm getting more
studs<00:06:12.289> maybe<00:06:12.560> there's<00:06:12.740> not<00:06:12.860> two<00:06:13.099> million<00:06:13.490> and

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:13.610 
studs maybe there's not two million and

00:06:13.610 --> 00:06:15.700 
studs maybe there's not two million and
there's<00:06:13.940> probably<00:06:14.180> a<00:06:14.389> million<00:06:14.660> a<00:06:14.930> quarter<00:06:15.590> or

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:15.710 
there's probably a million a quarter or

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:19.089 
there's probably a million a quarter or
something<00:06:16.010> like<00:06:16.130> that<00:06:17.740> so<00:06:18.740> you<00:06:18.800> can<00:06:18.919> see<00:06:19.070> I

00:06:19.089 --> 00:06:19.099 
something like that so you can see I

00:06:19.099 --> 00:06:21.390 
something like that so you can see I
still<00:06:19.370> don't<00:06:19.550> get<00:06:19.669> the<00:06:19.789> fishtank<00:06:20.180> one

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:21.400
