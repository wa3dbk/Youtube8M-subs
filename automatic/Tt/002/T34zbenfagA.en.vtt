00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:04.830
 Hello, I am the summer of the horses 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:07.470
 inside.com and I want you today 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:10.349
 we show two simple exercises 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:13.559
 already when cleaning the horse a basin 

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:15.719
 your whole hip area and yours 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:19.520
 legs and jump joints great 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:19.520
 can mobilize and make loose 

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:36.500
 the pool is he really that 

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:38.450
 center of movement of the rider and all 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:41.420
 very important area of â€‹â€‹the really 

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:42.980
 must be relaxed and elastic 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.650
 so that the back movement and the 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.940
 optimally record horses' movement and 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:48.949
 can help shape 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:51.470
 Unfortunately it is so by our sitting 

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:53.390
 work in the office and so on we are 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:56.690
 often blocked in this area 

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:59.180
 shortens inelastic and therefore unfortunately 

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:00.320
 also for the horse ballast and so to speak 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:02.780
 really one too 

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.309
 movement restriction what long term 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.729
 cause problems for the horse's back 

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:06.170
 can 

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:07.700
 I would like to give you a simple one now 

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:09.740
 Of course, exercises could show that as well 

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.479
 in the office and anywhere or even 

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:14.030
 if you stand somewhere and on the bus 

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:15.740
 wait or do something uncomplicated 

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:18.890
 but you can actually do it 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:21.320
 the plaster process an insert 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.080
 how it looks like I always say I am 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.159
 already non-smoker I always say 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.540
 cigar stub I leak 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:28.700
 I 've just got a cigarette 

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.439
 thrown off the ground and just turns 

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.390
 here with my tip this 

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:34.280
 cigarette off so we stand so 

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.660
 practically on the stand have that 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.610
 others play the game at one 

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:39.770
 Exercise plan loose and do now here 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.140
 These cigarettes exude exercise applicants 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.460
 in the end, cigarette 

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:45.830
 really obliterating cigarette stubs 

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:48.110
 wish we can first also more likely 

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:52.220
 Just run out of us easily 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:54.050
 get this movement coordinated and 

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:56.750
 By doing so you can already see it here 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:58.700
 in the end hip joint is there in the end 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.490
 yet how that hip joint moves and 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.350
 also relaxed is quite important 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:06.650
 of course that with both legs too 

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:08.360
 take turns and get there as well 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:10.310
 one already feels right 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.200
 but maybe a bit 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.450
 difficult for me or vice versa because 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.700
 if these movements are not even 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:18.470
 run and the bit hooked then can 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.550
 it may be that blockades also exist 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.700
 that maybe a good one 

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:24.980
 should seek the therapist 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:28.519
 variation of the exercise is also easy 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:30.500
 you just set up these verses and 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:31.730
 makes the same move only is now 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:33.769
 the heel on the ground 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:36.170
 Of course, we also have the 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:38.750
 variant of a leg and an exercise 

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:40.340
 or the leg we stretch 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:42.830
 de ski not completely through should we 

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.730
 let it go a bit loose but that 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.890
 entire legs 

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.810
 relatively knitted but not fixed now 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:50.599
 that pushed through the knee but just 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:54.739
 Then move a loosely stretched leg 

00:02:50.599 --> 00:02:58.299
 we just here the heel to the right and 

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:58.299
 left in the semicircle again 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:02.810
 Of course you can do that too first 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.420
 Run very slowly until you get that one 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:07.160
 bit of coordination better 

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:08.870
 You can make up for a bit of this 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:11.870
 exercise is not and is used to and 

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:14.540
 really great thing is when you're up here 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:17.120
 and in the back, so to speak, in the hip joint and 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:19.459
 on the buttocks if you have hands here 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:21.440
 it is so out of the 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:23.510
 sports science is known if one 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.430
 would like to improve movements 

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:27.260
 then it always makes sense his hands 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:30.680
 so to speak, that on the move 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:32.510
 to lay joint because so you get so 

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.940
 one actually moves two stimuli 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:36.650
 in the case now hip joint and the 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:39.859
 the second attraction is that you can talk about his 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:41.870
 sense of touch over this sample receptors in 

00:03:39.859 --> 00:03:44.780
 the hand really does that movement too 

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:47.030
 the body learns and thereby learns a lot 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.950
 faster to improve a movement 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:51.799
 or in this joint as well 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:52.970
 to really optimize agility and 

00:03:51.799 --> 00:03:55.669
 let go 

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:57.799
 So no matter which one if you do that 

00:03:55.669 --> 00:03:58.989
 possibility have your hands with you somewhere 

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:02.410
 to use 

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:10.760
 then do it because it's this one again 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:11.480
 training effect of course then strengthened 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:13.400
 also a little vary 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:16.130
 a little faster again a bit 

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:17.680
 slower when riding we need 

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:19.400
 Of course many are great 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:21.049
 Coordinations in the different 

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:24.169
 I do not move like that 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:25.849
 of course always different so that 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:27.470
 what we do today are a few small exercises 

00:04:25.849 --> 00:04:28.849
 if you liked that then 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:31.460
