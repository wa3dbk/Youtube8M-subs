hey<00:00:00.930> there<00:00:01.110> guys<00:00:01.260> I<00:00:01.469> have<00:00:01.560> one<00:00:01.829> more<00:00:01.860> unboxing

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:02.790 
hey there guys I have one more unboxing

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:08.830 
hey there guys I have one more unboxing
for<00:00:03.000> you<00:00:03.149> aha<00:00:03.750> this<00:00:04.140> is<00:00:04.589> the<00:00:05.220> nut<00:00:05.520> to<00:00:05.759> a<00:00:07.099> nhd<00:00:08.099> 14

00:00:08.830 --> 00:00:08.840 
for you aha this is the nut to a nhd 14

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:14.509 
for you aha this is the nut to a nhd 14
so<00:00:10.309> you<00:00:11.309> can't<00:00:11.519> say<00:00:11.730> it's<00:00:12.120> so<00:00:12.420> high<00:00:12.630> it<00:00:13.519> comes

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
so you can't say it's so high it comes

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.260 
so you can't say it's so high it comes
up<00:00:14.670> to<00:00:14.759> the<00:00:14.820> camera<00:00:15.030> so<00:00:15.900> this<00:00:16.049> is<00:00:16.080> a<00:00:16.199> dual<00:00:16.500> fan

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:17.270 
up to the camera so this is a dual fan

00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:22.189 
up to the camera so this is a dual fan
twin<00:00:18.270> tower<00:00:18.650> 140<00:00:19.650> /<00:00:19.890> 120<00:00:20.820> millimeter<00:00:21.199> cpu

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:28.040 
twin tower 140 / 120 millimeter cpu
cooler<00:00:25.010> what<00:00:26.010> that<00:00:26.130> means<00:00:26.340> is<00:00:26.580> it<00:00:27.420> has<00:00:27.630> two

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:28.050 
cooler what that means is it has two

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.349 
cooler what that means is it has two
towers<00:00:28.560> instead<00:00:29.070> of<00:00:29.189> one<00:00:29.429> where<00:00:30.119> the<00:00:30.210> heat

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:30.359 
towers instead of one where the heat

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:39.709 
towers instead of one where the heat
pipes<00:00:30.570> go<00:00:30.810> into<00:00:31.460> and<00:00:37.700> as<00:00:38.700> two<00:00:38.940> fans<00:00:39.180> one<00:00:39.329> is<00:00:39.600> a

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
pipes go into and as two fans one is a

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.190 
pipes go into and as two fans one is a
140mm<00:00:40.379> you<00:00:40.590> and<00:00:40.800> one<00:00:41.040> is<00:00:41.160> a<00:00:41.870> 120<00:00:42.870> millimeter

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:35.100 
this cooler that's my hand and of course
here<00:02:32.530> is<00:02:33.190> a<00:02:33.250> soda<00:02:33.459> can<00:02:33.690> she<00:02:34.690> give<00:02:34.780> an<00:02:34.870> idea<00:02:34.900> how

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.110 
here is a soda can she give an idea how

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:36.780 
here is a soda can she give an idea how
big<00:02:35.230> it<00:02:35.380> is<00:02:35.440> pretty<00:02:35.950> large<00:02:36.040> so<00:02:36.489> what<00:02:36.700> I'm

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
big it is pretty large so what I'm

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.009 
big it is pretty large so what I'm
really<00:02:36.880> excited<00:02:37.150> about<00:02:37.299> this<00:02:37.420> cooler<00:02:37.780> is<00:02:37.810> not

00:02:38.009 --> 00:02:38.019 
really excited about this cooler is not

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:39.960 
really excited about this cooler is not
only<00:02:38.290> that<00:02:38.410> is<00:02:38.590> amazing<00:02:38.829> performance<00:02:39.459> but

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:39.970 
only that is amazing performance but

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:42.059 
only that is amazing performance but
that<00:02:40.150> it<00:02:40.239> has<00:02:40.360> amazing<00:02:40.630> performance<00:02:41.349> while

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:42.069 
that it has amazing performance while

00:02:42.069 --> 00:02:45.240 
that it has amazing performance while
being<00:02:42.370> silent<00:02:43.090> so<00:02:43.690> it<00:02:43.810> has<00:02:43.840> these<00:02:44.769> adapters

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
being silent so it has these adapters

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:46.559 
being silent so it has these adapters
that<00:02:45.280> I<00:02:45.430> was<00:02:45.519> talking<00:02:45.640> about<00:02:45.940> and<00:02:46.180> those

00:02:46.559 --> 00:02:46.569 
that I was talking about and those

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:48.660 
that I was talking about and those
adapters<00:02:47.019> allow<00:02:47.680> it<00:02:47.799> to<00:02:47.829> run<00:02:48.010> effectively

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
adapters allow it to run effectively

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.720 
adapters allow it to run effectively
silently<00:02:49.329> so<00:02:49.900> here<00:02:50.110> you<00:02:50.200> have<00:02:50.230> the<00:02:50.730> 120

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
silently so here you have the 120

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.539 
silently so here you have the 120
millimeter<00:02:52.060> fan<00:02:52.410> I've<00:02:53.410> heard<00:02:53.620> that<00:02:53.680> touching

00:02:54.539 --> 00:02:54.549 
millimeter fan I've heard that touching

00:02:54.549 --> 00:02:55.710 
millimeter fan I've heard that touching
the<00:02:54.639> fans<00:02:54.819> is<00:02:54.940> actually<00:02:55.209> a<00:02:55.239> bad<00:02:55.359> idea<00:02:55.540> so<00:02:55.660> i

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:55.720 
the fans is actually a bad idea so i

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.270 
the fans is actually a bad idea so i
might<00:02:55.870> do<00:02:56.049> that<00:02:56.139> much<00:02:56.380> and<00:02:56.950> then<00:02:57.069> we<00:02:57.160> have<00:02:57.250> a

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
might do that much and then we have a

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.520 
might do that much and then we have a
140<00:02:57.880> million<00:02:58.030> fan<00:02:58.359> now<00:02:59.079> the<00:02:59.139> reason<00:02:59.319> you<00:02:59.440> have

00:02:59.520 --> 00:02:59.530 
140 million fan now the reason you have

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.710 
140 million fan now the reason you have
a<00:02:59.560> 140<00:03:00.010> in<00:03:00.100> the<00:03:00.160> middle<00:03:00.430> is<00:03:00.579> because<00:03:01.480> if<00:03:01.630> you

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
a 140 in the middle is because if you

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.410 
a 140 in the middle is because if you
had<00:03:01.840> on<00:03:01.959> the<00:03:02.019> side<00:03:02.380> then<00:03:02.859> you'd<00:03:03.609> block<00:03:03.910> your

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
had on the side then you'd block your

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:07.710 
had on the side then you'd block your
memory<00:03:04.630> slots<00:03:04.870> or<00:03:05.639> possibly<00:03:06.639> could<00:03:06.970> so<00:03:07.660> by

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:07.720 
memory slots or possibly could so by

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:09.360 
memory slots or possibly could so by
putting<00:03:07.870> in<00:03:08.019> the<00:03:08.079> middle<00:03:08.350> you<00:03:08.530> actually<00:03:09.250> get

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:09.370 
putting in the middle you actually get

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:12.120 
putting in the middle you actually get
extra<00:03:10.180> airflow<00:03:10.329> down<00:03:10.720> here<00:03:11.109> passing<00:03:11.739> around

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.130 
extra airflow down here passing around

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:14.370 
extra airflow down here passing around
back<00:03:12.519> and<00:03:12.549> forth<00:03:12.910> in<00:03:13.120> a<00:03:13.180> sort<00:03:13.959> of<00:03:13.989> collateral

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
back and forth in a sort of collateral

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.190 
back and forth in a sort of collateral
airflow<00:03:14.980> if<00:03:15.100> you<00:03:15.220> will<00:03:15.400> that<00:03:15.870> helps<00:03:16.870> cool<00:03:17.049> down

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
airflow if you will that helps cool down

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.140 
airflow if you will that helps cool down
the<00:03:17.290> chipset<00:03:17.680> so<00:03:18.549> you<00:03:18.670> might<00:03:18.849> be<00:03:18.880> able<00:03:19.000> to

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
the chipset so you might be able to

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:20.729 
the chipset so you might be able to
notice<00:03:19.359> that<00:03:19.569> on<00:03:20.019> the<00:03:20.200> heatsink<00:03:20.560> you<00:03:20.620> have

00:03:20.729 --> 00:03:20.739 
notice that on the heatsink you have

00:03:20.739 --> 00:03:22.530 
notice that on the heatsink you have
these<00:03:20.829> little<00:03:20.980> fins<00:03:21.310> here<00:03:21.609> and<00:03:21.790> my

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:22.540 
these little fins here and my

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:23.699 
these little fins here and my
understanding<00:03:22.569> is<00:03:23.019> that<00:03:23.079> that<00:03:23.380> creates<00:03:23.590> a

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
understanding is that that creates a

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:25.080 
understanding is that that creates a
little<00:03:23.950> bit<00:03:24.069> of<00:03:24.099> extra<00:03:24.190> turbulence<00:03:24.790> to

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
little bit of extra turbulence to

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.390 
little bit of extra turbulence to
enhance<00:03:25.840> the<00:03:26.109> cooling<00:03:26.410> performance<00:03:26.560> so

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
enhance the cooling performance so

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:28.650 
enhance the cooling performance so
that's<00:03:27.519> about<00:03:27.639> it<00:03:27.790> thank<00:03:28.269> you<00:03:28.329> very<00:03:28.389> much<00:03:28.630> for

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:28.660 
that's about it thank you very much for

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:30.390 
that's about it thank you very much for
watching<00:03:28.840> and<00:03:29.230> I<00:03:29.590> hope<00:03:29.620> to<00:03:29.739> see<00:03:29.950> you<00:03:30.010> back<00:03:30.130> when

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
watching and I hope to see you back when

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.109 
watching and I hope to see you back when
I<00:03:30.430> start<00:03:30.730> building<00:03:31.480> my<00:03:31.630> system
