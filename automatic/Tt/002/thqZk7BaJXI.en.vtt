00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:09.200 
we have the guitar in tune let's talk
about<00:02:07.200> how<00:02:07.500> the<00:02:07.560> guitar<00:02:07.770> does<00:02:08.250> that<00:02:08.520> somehow

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:09.210 
about how the guitar does that somehow

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:12.530 
about how the guitar does that somehow
and<00:02:09.540> don't<00:02:09.840> ask<00:02:10.020> me<00:02:10.200> how<00:02:10.320> exactly<00:02:10.530> it<00:02:11.540> measures

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
and don't ask me how exactly it measures

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.290 
and don't ask me how exactly it measures
the<00:02:12.750> string<00:02:12.990> length<00:02:13.140> it<00:02:13.590> knows<00:02:13.950> that<00:02:14.400> somehow

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
the string length it knows that somehow

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.320 
the string length it knows that somehow
that<00:02:15.480> the<00:02:16.170> nut<00:02:16.380> is<00:02:16.560> right<00:02:16.770> here<00:02:17.130> okay<00:02:17.850> it's

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 
that the nut is right here okay it's

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:19.670 
that the nut is right here okay it's
measuring<00:02:18.750> the<00:02:18.870> string<00:02:19.110> length<00:02:19.260> from<00:02:19.560> the

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:19.680 
measuring the string length from the

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:22.370 
measuring the string length from the
from<00:02:20.130> the<00:02:20.220> bridge<00:02:20.490> to<00:02:20.760> the<00:02:21.000> nut<00:02:21.180> what<00:02:22.170> we<00:02:22.260> can

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:22.380 
from the bridge to the nut what we can

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:23.720 
from the bridge to the nut what we can
do<00:02:22.500> is<00:02:22.620> we<00:02:22.709> can<00:02:22.860> actually<00:02:22.980> trick<00:02:23.520> the

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:23.730 
do is we can actually trick the

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:26.030 
do is we can actually trick the
processor<00:02:24.360> into<00:02:24.600> moving<00:02:24.840> the<00:02:25.050> nut<00:02:25.320> around<00:02:25.770> on

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:26.040 
processor into moving the nut around on

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.740 
processor into moving the nut around on
all<00:02:26.250> the<00:02:26.459> strings<00:02:26.790> or<00:02:27.030> a<00:02:27.060> few<00:02:27.330> of<00:02:27.420> the<00:02:27.480> strings

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:27.750 
all the strings or a few of the strings

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:30.290 
all the strings or a few of the strings
if<00:02:27.870> we<00:02:27.990> want<00:02:28.170> to<00:02:28.260> anyway<00:02:28.709> we<00:02:28.890> want<00:02:29.130> so<00:02:29.940> the<00:02:30.120> math

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
if we want to anyway we want so the math

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:31.820 
if we want to anyway we want so the math
works<00:02:30.630> like<00:02:30.870> this<00:02:31.080> if<00:02:31.290> I<00:02:31.410> lay<00:02:31.590> my<00:02:31.770> finger

00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:31.830 
works like this if I lay my finger

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.460 
works like this if I lay my finger
across<00:02:32.490> the<00:02:32.940> second<00:02:33.420> fret<00:02:33.660> let's<00:02:33.870> say<00:02:34.110> I<00:02:34.140> can

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
across the second fret let's say I can

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.949 
across the second fret let's say I can
do<00:02:34.590> it<00:02:34.680> anywhere<00:02:35.010> on<00:02:35.070> the<00:02:35.220> neck<00:02:35.600> and<00:02:36.600> strum

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
do it anywhere on the neck and strum

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:39.020 
do it anywhere on the neck and strum
through<00:02:37.200> and<00:02:37.350> hit<00:02:37.440> the<00:02:37.470> processor<00:02:38.160> the<00:02:38.730> guitar

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
through and hit the processor the guitar

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:41.990

00:02:59.330 --> 00:02:59.340 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.860 

and<00:03:00.340> I<00:03:00.430> can<00:03:00.580> keep<00:03:00.760> going<00:03:00.790> up<00:03:01.240> the<00:03:01.390> neck<00:03:01.570> if<00:03:01.720> I'd

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
and I can keep going up the neck if I'd

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:05.970 
and I can keep going up the neck if I'd
like<00:03:02.730> and<00:03:03.900> the<00:03:04.900> fifth<00:03:05.140> fret<00:03:05.410> we're<00:03:05.710> going<00:03:05.890> to

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980 
like and the fifth fret we're going to

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:15.670 
like and the fifth fret we're going to
find<00:03:06.190> baritone<00:03:06.730> tuning

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:15.680 

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:22.030

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:22.040 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:24.680 

so<00:03:23.040> you<00:03:23.130> can<00:03:23.250> also<00:03:23.400> do<00:03:23.730> alternate<00:03:24.360> tunings

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:24.690 
so you can also do alternate tunings

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.360 
so you can also do alternate tunings
open<00:03:25.080> tunings<00:03:25.440> if<00:03:25.590> you'd<00:03:25.709> like<00:03:25.860> let's<00:03:26.130> say<00:03:26.250> we

open tunings if you'd like let's say we
just<00:03:26.520> want<00:03:26.670> standard<00:03:27.150> tuning<00:03:27.450> with<00:03:27.630> the<00:03:27.720> drop

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:28.020 
just want standard tuning with the drop

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:29.930 
just want standard tuning with the drop
D<00:03:28.290> I<00:03:28.470> don't<00:03:28.680> have<00:03:28.860> to<00:03:29.010> do<00:03:29.130> all<00:03:29.370> of<00:03:29.400> the<00:03:29.670> strings

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:31.770 
I can do one of the strings so the low E

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:39.259 
I can do one of the strings so the low E
string<00:03:32.010> by<00:03:32.459> itself<00:03:37.580> our<00:03:38.580> and<00:03:38.819> drop<00:03:39.030> D<00:03:39.209> tuning

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:42.229 
string by itself our and drop D tuning
or<00:03:39.750> let's<00:03:40.230> put<00:03:40.290> the<00:03:40.500> whole<00:03:40.620> guitar<00:03:40.800> into<00:03:41.310> D<00:03:41.610> and

or let's put the whole guitar into D and

00:03:42.239 --> 00:03:50.850 
or let's put the whole guitar into D and
let's<00:03:42.480> drop<00:03:42.660> the<00:03:42.840> low<00:03:42.989> E<00:03:43.019> down<00:03:43.380> to<00:03:43.560> C

00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:50.860 

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:53.410 

one<00:03:51.860> thing<00:03:52.070> on<00:03:52.190> a<00:03:52.220> clean<00:03:52.520> app<00:03:52.730> but<00:03:52.970> on<00:03:53.060> a<00:03:53.090> nice

00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:05.900 
so you're able to get drop tunings as

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:07.990 
so you're able to get drop tunings as
low<00:04:06.080> as<00:04:06.200> you'd<00:04:06.320> like<00:04:06.470> to<00:04:06.620> go<00:04:06.770> and<00:04:07.100> you<00:04:07.790> get<00:04:07.880> to
