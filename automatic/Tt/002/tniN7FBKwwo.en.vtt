gone then when you can constantly going
out<00:01:21.920> and<00:01:22.369> just<00:01:22.550> wondering<00:01:23.149> when<00:01:23.360> the<00:01:23.660> next

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840

time<00:01:24.080> is<00:01:24.350> there's<00:01:25.100> gonna<00:01:25.310> happen

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:28.780 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:34.320 

give<00:01:29.780> those<00:01:29.869> statements<00:01:30.970> I<00:01:31.970> did<00:01:32.179> I<00:01:32.360> don't<00:01:32.690> know

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:34.330

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.330 
give those statements I did I don't know
and<00:01:35.330> so<00:01:35.360> I<00:01:35.630> became<00:01:35.960> when<00:01:36.470> I<00:01:36.500> came<00:01:36.590> home<00:01:37.009> and<00:01:37.220> I

00:01:37.330 --> 00:01:37.340 
and so I became when I came home and I

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.820 
and so I became when I came home and I
and<00:01:37.759> I<00:01:37.880> was<00:01:38.600> constantly<00:01:39.140> in<00:01:39.409> that<00:01:39.619> mode<00:01:39.800> I

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:39.830 
and I was constantly in that mode I

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.100 
and I was constantly in that mode I
couldn't<00:01:40.250> turn<00:01:40.369> it<00:01:40.429> off<00:01:40.670> to<00:01:40.940> where<00:01:41.119> you<00:01:41.990> don't

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.110 
couldn't turn it off to where you don't

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:43.600 
couldn't turn it off to where you don't
know<00:01:42.320> what's<00:01:42.590> gonna<00:01:42.770> happen<00:01:42.860> when<00:01:43.250> and<00:01:43.429> where

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:43.610 
know what's gonna happen when and where

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:46.300 
know what's gonna happen when and where
and<00:01:44.060> the<00:01:44.869> paranoia<00:01:45.320> and<00:01:45.649> you<00:01:45.740> know<00:01:45.830> I<00:01:45.860> have<00:01:46.009> a

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:46.310 
and the paranoia and you know I have a

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.249 
and the paranoia and you know I have a
little<00:01:46.460> visual<00:01:46.880> it's<00:01:47.149> just<00:01:47.450> filled<00:01:47.690> out<00:01:47.840> the

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:48.259 
little visual it's just filled out the

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:52.030 
little visual it's just filled out the
roof<00:01:48.700> and<00:01:49.700> and<00:01:50.420> it<00:01:50.990> becomes<00:01:51.440> overwhelming

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:52.040 
roof and and it becomes overwhelming

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:53.920 
roof and and it becomes overwhelming
especially<00:01:52.820> when<00:01:53.270> it<00:01:53.390> starts<00:01:53.630> to<00:01:53.689> take<00:01:53.840> a<00:01:53.869> toll

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:53.930 
especially when it starts to take a toll

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.649 
especially when it starts to take a toll
and<00:01:54.259> people<00:01:54.710> you<00:01:54.799> love<00:01:55.299> your<00:01:56.299> your
