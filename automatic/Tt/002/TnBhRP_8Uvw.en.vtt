00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:34.300 
things that I'm thinking of real quick

things that I'm thinking of real quick

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:36.880 
well three actually when you have

mascara if you haven't watched some of

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:40.860 
mascara if you haven't watched some of
my<00:00:39.100> other<00:00:39.280> videos<00:00:39.370> i<00:00:39.670> talked<00:00:40.090> about<00:00:40.120> linking

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:40.870 
my other videos i talked about linking

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:44.370 
my other videos i talked about linking
your<00:00:41.260> lashes<00:00:41.590> and<00:00:42.100> what<00:00:42.640> making<00:00:42.910> is<00:00:43.270> is<00:00:43.570> two

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:44.380 
your lashes and what making is is two

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:46.680 
your lashes and what making is is two
coats<00:00:44.650> of<00:00:44.920> mascara<00:00:45.160> still<00:00:45.970> most<00:00:46.210> people<00:00:46.570> use

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:46.690 
coats of mascara still most people use

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.920 
coats of mascara still most people use
two<00:00:46.870> quotes<00:00:47.140> and<00:00:47.580> the<00:00:48.580> first<00:00:48.850> one<00:00:49.120> brown<00:00:49.510> and

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:49.930 
two quotes and the first one brown and

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:54.420 
two quotes and the first one brown and
the<00:00:50.170> second<00:00:50.590> one<00:00:50.739> black<00:00:51.309> and<00:00:51.640> the<00:00:52.629> brown<00:00:53.430> makes

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:54.430 
the second one black and the brown makes

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:57.180 
the second one black and the brown makes
them<00:00:54.640> a<00:00:54.730> thicker<00:00:55.030> and<00:00:55.330> the<00:00:56.320> black<00:00:56.589> makes<00:00:57.040> them

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:57.190 
them a thicker and the black makes them

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.100 
them a thicker and the black makes them
look<00:00:57.339> longer<00:00:57.670> so<00:00:58.030> they're<00:00:58.180> just<00:00:58.420> really<00:00:58.839> an

00:00:59.100 --> 00:00:59.110 
look longer so they're just really an

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:01.680 
look longer so they're just really an
incredible<00:00:59.400> full<00:01:00.400> look<00:01:00.820> but<00:01:01.390> when<00:01:01.540> you<00:01:01.570> have

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:01.690 
incredible full look but when you have

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:05.310 
incredible full look but when you have
two<00:01:02.170> mascaras<00:01:02.680> sometimes<00:01:03.839> it's<00:01:04.839> really<00:01:05.140> hard

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:05.320 
two mascaras sometimes it's really hard

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:08.040 
two mascaras sometimes it's really hard
to<00:01:05.740> distinguish<00:01:06.220> between<00:01:06.430> them<00:01:06.790> so<00:01:06.970> I<00:01:07.210> make

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:08.050 
to distinguish between them so I make

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:09.750 
to distinguish between them so I make
sure<00:01:08.080> that<00:01:08.260> I<00:01:08.440> make<00:01:08.980> sure<00:01:09.190> the<00:01:09.340> lids<00:01:09.580> are

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:09.760 
sure that I make sure the lids are

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.370 
sure that I make sure the lids are
different<00:01:10.150> so<00:01:10.270> this<00:01:10.450> is<00:01:10.570> the<00:01:10.720> brown<00:01:10.930> one<00:01:11.200> and

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:11.380 
different so this is the brown one and

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.100 
different so this is the brown one and
this<00:01:11.590> is<00:01:11.770> the<00:01:11.890> black<00:01:12.100> one<00:01:12.370> and<00:01:12.580> if<00:01:13.390> I<00:01:13.570> have<00:01:13.810> to

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:14.110 
this is the black one and if I have to

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:18.360 
this is the black one and if I have to
that<00:01:15.040> match<00:01:15.659> because<00:01:16.659> of<00:01:16.960> the<00:01:17.050> same<00:01:17.290> brand<00:01:17.620> I

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:18.370 
that match because of the same brand I

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:21.240 
that match because of the same brand I
usually<00:01:19.210> use<00:01:19.630> a<00:01:19.659> thing<00:01:19.990> of<00:01:20.170> fingernail<00:01:21.070> polish

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:21.250 
usually use a thing of fingernail polish

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.200 
usually use a thing of fingernail polish
and<00:01:21.729> so<00:01:22.300> I<00:01:22.330> mean<00:01:22.570> you<00:01:22.750> can<00:01:22.900> tell<00:01:23.140> that<00:01:23.170> one<00:01:24.210> can

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:25.210 
and so I mean you can tell that one can

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.150 
and so I mean you can tell that one can
you<00:01:25.270> see<00:01:25.480> it<00:01:25.570> or<00:01:25.690> not<00:01:25.840> see<00:01:26.140> it<00:01:26.230> it's<00:01:26.470> pink<00:01:26.830> I

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:27.160 
you see it or not see it it's pink I

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.130 
you see it or not see it it's pink I
painted<00:01:27.790> fingernail<00:01:28.210> polish<00:01:28.390> on<00:01:28.720> that<00:01:28.870> one<00:01:29.020> so

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:29.140 
painted fingernail polish on that one so

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:31.230 
painted fingernail polish on that one so
I<00:01:29.170> know<00:01:29.320> that's<00:01:29.680> the<00:01:29.890> brown<00:01:30.100> one<00:01:30.310> and<00:01:30.520> on<00:01:31.030> this

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:31.240 
I know that's the brown one and on this

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:35.040 
I know that's the brown one and on this
one<00:01:31.480> on<00:01:31.780> this<00:01:32.500> set<00:01:32.830> I<00:01:33.070> did<00:01:33.670> the<00:01:33.790> same<00:01:34.000> thing<00:01:34.050> so

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:35.050 
one on this set I did the same thing so

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:37.080 
one on this set I did the same thing so
that<00:01:35.260> i<00:01:35.290> know<00:01:35.350> when<00:01:35.650> i<00:01:35.680> pick<00:01:35.770> it<00:01:36.100> up<00:01:36.250> that<00:01:36.940> this

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:37.090 
that i know when i pick it up that this

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.460 
that i know when i pick it up that this
one<00:01:37.330> is<00:01:37.360> the<00:01:37.600> brown<00:01:37.840> one<00:01:38.020> so<00:01:38.740> that<00:01:39.160> is<00:01:39.400> one<00:01:39.700> tip

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 
one is the brown one so that is one tip

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.080 
one is the brown one so that is one tip
well<00:01:41.470> actually<00:01:41.590> that's<00:01:41.890> to<00:01:42.160> the<00:01:42.430> linking<00:01:42.850> and

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090 
well actually that's to the linking and

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.440 
well actually that's to the linking and
then<00:01:43.780> how<00:01:44.560> to<00:01:44.590> distinguish<00:01:45.430> which<00:01:45.970> ones<00:01:46.270> are

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:46.450 
then how to distinguish which ones are

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:48.770 
then how to distinguish which ones are
which<00:01:46.480> and<00:01:46.900> sometimes<00:01:47.740> if<00:01:48.310> you're<00:01:48.520> not

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
which and sometimes if you're not

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.810

which should be every three months you

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.070 
which should be every three months you
buy<00:01:53.740> a<00:01:53.770> new<00:01:54.040> set<00:01:54.430> of<00:01:54.610> mascara<00:01:55.150> or<00:01:55.360> open<00:01:55.780> a<00:01:55.870> brand
