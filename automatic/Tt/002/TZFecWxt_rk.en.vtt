Team<00:00:57.190> Canada<00:00:57.219> West<00:00:57.820> I<00:00:58.120> think<00:00:58.600> is<00:00:58.719> the<00:00:58.870> u19<00:00:59.440> is

00:00:59.520 --> 00:00:59.530 
Team Canada West I think is the u19 is

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:01.229 
Team Canada West I think is the u19 is
there<00:00:59.710> and<00:01:00.190> that's<00:01:00.670> a<00:01:00.730> little<00:01:00.820> bit<00:01:00.940> different

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:01.239 
there and that's a little bit different

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:02.880 
there and that's a little bit different
than<00:01:01.329> the<00:01:01.390> u-17<00:01:01.660> so<00:01:02.050> I'm<00:01:02.109> a<00:01:02.140> younger<00:01:02.410> guy<00:01:02.590> I<00:01:02.620> was

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:02.890 
than the u-17 so I'm a younger guy I was

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:13.990

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.859 
definitely cool I think this would be my
fourth<00:01:14.259> here<00:01:14.860> so<00:01:15.160> we<00:01:16.030> haven't<00:01:16.420> done<00:01:16.509> too<00:01:16.690> well

00:01:16.859 --> 00:01:16.869 
fourth here so we haven't done too well

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:19.109 
fourth here so we haven't done too well
and<00:01:17.170> concerning<00:01:18.039> with<00:01:18.160> metals<00:01:18.520> and<00:01:18.610> stuff<00:01:18.910> so

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:21.180 
and concerning with metals and stuff so
I'm<00:01:19.840> really<00:01:19.960> hoping<00:01:20.320> that<00:01:20.380> this<00:01:20.740> time<00:01:20.950> we<00:01:21.070> can

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:21.190
