that I think men are just as odd if not
a<00:02:46.239> bit<00:02:46.450> older<00:02:46.750> than<00:02:46.870> women<00:02:47.170> to<00:02:47.260> be<00:02:47.349> honest<00:02:47.620> yeah

simple<00:03:49.000> brains<00:03:50.220> this<00:03:51.220> gene<00:03:51.519> that<00:03:51.760> I'll<00:03:52.000> have

00:03:52.289 --> 00:03:52.299 
simple brains this gene that I'll have

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:54.569 
simple brains this gene that I'll have
one<00:03:52.450> of<00:03:52.599> yours<00:03:52.840> gene<00:03:53.290> what's<00:03:53.859> that<00:03:54.099> well<00:03:54.549> I

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:54.579 
one of yours gene what's that well I

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:55.830 
one of yours gene what's that well I
think<00:03:54.639> all<00:03:54.940> men<00:03:55.120> can<00:03:55.329> relate<00:03:55.569> to<00:03:55.660> this<00:03:55.780> and

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:55.840 
think all men can relate to this and

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.150 
think all men can relate to this and
women<00:03:56.170> do<00:03:56.290> this<00:03:56.440> a<00:03:56.470> lot<00:03:56.680> it's<00:03:56.829> nothing<00:03:57.040> more

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:57.160 
women do this a lot it's nothing more

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:00.000
