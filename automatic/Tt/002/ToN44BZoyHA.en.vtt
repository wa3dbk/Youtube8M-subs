00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:18.190 
compared to a lot of my other drawings
was<00:03:14.380> easier<00:03:15.380> and<00:03:15.980> when<00:03:16.970> I<00:03:17.000> was<00:03:17.150> a<00:03:17.209> easier<00:03:17.510> it

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:18.200 
was easier and when I was a easier it

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:19.930 
was easier and when I was a easier it
didn't<00:03:18.620> take<00:03:18.680> as<00:03:19.010> long<00:03:19.190> this<00:03:19.400> maybe<00:03:19.669> took

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
didn't take as long this maybe took

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:21.909 
didn't take as long this maybe took
maybe<00:03:20.209> an<00:03:20.389> hour<00:03:20.540> and<00:03:20.780> a<00:03:20.810> half<00:03:20.989> so<00:03:21.590> that's<00:03:21.769> why

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:21.919 
maybe an hour and a half so that's why

00:03:21.919 --> 00:03:26.800 
maybe an hour and a half so that's why
this<00:03:21.980> video<00:03:22.459> is<00:03:22.579> a<00:03:22.609> little<00:03:23.919> shorter<00:03:24.919> but<00:03:25.810> it's
