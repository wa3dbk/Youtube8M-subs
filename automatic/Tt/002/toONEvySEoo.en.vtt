00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:11.549
 According to the data of the Fisheries and Conservation Department 

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:15.102
 On average, thirty dogs are humanely destroyed every day. 

00:00:15.392 --> 00:00:18.763
 Most of them are healthy, friendly and lovely. 

00:00:19.154 --> 00:00:22.577
 Part of it is a dog that lives freely on the mountain side. 

00:00:22.916 --> 00:00:26.070
 Friends who have been concerned about animal rights for many years 

00:00:26.379 --> 00:00:28.990
 Against this cruel practice 

00:00:29.352 --> 00:00:32.562
 Recently, the fishing and shelter office finally got TNVR. 

00:00:32.914 --> 00:00:36.415
 Capture, sterilize, inject, put back 

00:00:36.756 --> 00:00:39.336
 Referred to as "sterilization and return" for consultation 

00:00:39.815 --> 00:00:42.508
 Hope to reduce the humanitarian destruction of dogs 

00:00:42.938 --> 00:00:45.998
 As the current legislation does not allow volunteers 

00:00:46.298 --> 00:00:48.089
 Help stray dogs to be sterilized and put back 

00:00:48.498 --> 00:00:50.999
 Make many volunteers contribute money 

00:00:51.389 --> 00:00:52.699
 Also to be told by the AFCD 

00:00:53.088 --> 00:00:54.269
 Really unfair 

00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:57.900
 There is a dog called Didi. 

00:00:58.833 --> 00:01:02.434
 Lived here for almost seven or eight years 

00:01:03.294 --> 00:01:07.706
 And the villagers there are actually living in harmony 

00:01:08.247 --> 00:01:09.948
 Although it does not belong to any one owner 

00:01:10.387 --> 00:01:13.620
 But it is also a village dog, belonging to this community. 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:17.431
 I helped sterilize it later. 

00:01:19.622 --> 00:01:21.692
 Later I knew the legal problem. 

00:01:22.082 --> 00:01:24.642
 Even though it lives in this village 

00:01:25.273 --> 00:01:26.523
 Living in harmony with the people here 

00:01:26.903 --> 00:01:27.923
 But because it has no chips 

00:01:28.313 --> 00:01:30.353
 That is, it does not belong to any owner 

00:01:30.703 --> 00:01:32.803
 So when someone complains about it one day 

00:01:33.163 --> 00:01:34.983
 Dog-hunting team with fishing and shelter 

00:01:35.413 --> 00:01:37.073
 It may be caught 

00:01:37.683 --> 00:01:40.223
 Everyone knows that if you are caught for four days, no one will claim it. 

00:01:40.583 --> 00:01:42.023
 Didi is actually a dead end 

00:01:42.524 --> 00:01:44.033
 So I am worried 

00:01:44.444 --> 00:01:49.625
 Take it to the collar and there will be a dog tag. 

00:01:51.506 --> 00:01:52.820
 But one day after the time of walking 

00:01:53.309 --> 00:01:57.972
 Let the fishermen’s people catch 

00:01:58.343 --> 00:02:01.632
 Because (wafer) has my name 

00:02:01.913 --> 00:02:03.043
 So I redeem it immediately 

00:02:03.563 --> 00:02:07.012
 I paid some ransom when I redeemed it. 

00:02:07.463 --> 00:02:08.622
 Detention fee 

00:02:09.073 --> 00:02:12.024
 They asked me to redeem the next day. 

00:02:12.494 --> 00:02:14.194
 I received more than 700 yuan for my accommodation. 

00:02:14.624 --> 00:02:18.046
 At first thought that things have subsided. 

00:02:18.356 --> 00:02:19.397
 Because I explained to them 

00:02:19.817 --> 00:02:21.598
 It's just a village dog, not a bite 

00:02:22.738 --> 00:02:26.218
 But half a year later, the AFCD suddenly issued a ticket to send me a ticket. 

00:02:26.549 --> 00:02:29.870
 Means that I am a dog registrant 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.309
 But the dog walks in public places without care. 

00:02:34.691 --> 00:02:35.871
 Then sue me 

00:02:36.294 --> 00:02:40.415
 Finally because it is my name wafer 

00:02:40.695 --> 00:02:42.836
 The law has no human feelings at all. 

00:02:43.127 --> 00:02:45.467
 Even knowing the story behind it will not be considered 

00:02:46.027 --> 00:02:50.248
 Finally, the crime was fined more than two thousand yuan. 

00:02:52.156 --> 00:02:53.427
 Volunteers have the risk of being prosecuted 

00:02:53.817 --> 00:02:55.618
 Also often under pressure from some citizens 

00:02:56.227 --> 00:02:59.699
 They think that dogs living in the community will be filthy. 

00:03:00.058 --> 00:03:01.678
 Affect their lives 

00:03:02.021 --> 00:03:05.911
 According to non-profit veterinarian Mai Zhicheng in the vicinity of Wong Tai Sin 

00:03:06.341 --> 00:03:08.081
 After the sterilization is put back 

00:03:08.421 --> 00:03:10.751
 Public complaints are significantly reduced 

00:03:11.541 --> 00:03:13.752
 I have two indicators to prove 

00:03:14.501 --> 00:03:21.962
 Past residents or District Council data for the past year 

00:03:22.313 --> 00:03:25.875
 All refer to the number of complaints about stray dogs is much less 

00:03:28.485 --> 00:03:29.726
 It used to be very simple 

00:03:30.036 --> 00:03:32.959
 When there is a stray dog, it will be sent to the AFCD. 

00:03:33.358 --> 00:03:35.129
 The AFCD confessed that it would not give me face. 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.091
 They will go to catch dogs when there are dogs. 

00:03:39.491 --> 00:03:50.375
 The number of dogs caught by the AFCD in the past two years is zero. 

00:03:50.775 --> 00:03:54.781
 They all have complaints to catch dogs. 

00:03:54.781 --> 00:03:56.011
 Do you think the government really has a lot of time? 

00:03:56.311 --> 00:03:57.821
 It can be seen that the complaint is really much less. 

00:03:58.151 --> 00:04:00.291
 I don’t know if it’s really zero. 

00:04:00.801 --> 00:04:03.532
 Another indicator is the naked eye. 

00:04:04.092 --> 00:04:09.974
 You have traveled to Huangrenxian District in Zhuyuan North District and Cizhen Village 

00:04:10.593 --> 00:04:12.544
 The dog did not go down the mountain 

00:04:12.884 --> 00:04:17.074
 Once upon a time there was a downhill activity in the area. 

00:04:19.228 --> 00:04:21.588
 There are no dogs in the district. 

00:04:22.668 --> 00:04:25.409
 I heard the neighborhood saying 

00:04:25.759 --> 00:04:33.595
 If you put the dog sterilization back, you will feel noisy. 

00:04:33.925 --> 00:04:40.426
 Not everyone is happy to be a neighbor with cats and dogs. 

00:04:40.756 --> 00:04:44.028
 They will give pressure to the district board members 

00:04:44.358 --> 00:04:49.199
 We also understand that the government has resistance. 

00:04:49.569 --> 00:04:52.591
 So why don’t we reduce (funding) 1.3 million but half 

00:04:54.021 --> 00:04:57.782
 Because we have calculated that there is a so-called "nine deaths" 

00:04:58.194 --> 00:05:04.048
 That is, it kills only 9 of them and can be adopted to escape. 

00:05:04.418 --> 00:05:11.340
 So in order to avoid others being too stubborn 

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:16.742
 We only cut half, hope to become five dead and five 

00:05:17.082 --> 00:05:21.973
 This is our position 

00:05:22.455 --> 00:05:28.288
 I have spoken in the Legislative Council many times and have quoted Gandhi to speak. 

00:05:31.672 --> 00:05:41.854
 To see if a country is civilized and of high quality 

00:05:41.854 --> 00:05:43.664
 See how they treat animals 

00:05:45.459 --> 00:05:49.172
 I believe this is really a few words. 

00:05:51.153 --> 00:05:55.585
 If you can't live peacefully with animals, you can be friends. 

00:05:55.936 --> 00:05:59.855
 The local civilization is extremely limited 

00:06:00.846 --> 00:06:04.038
 If in accordance with current regulations 

00:06:04.378 --> 00:06:11.854
 We help (wandering) dogs to release the wafer and tell us 

00:06:12.143 --> 00:06:18.616
 Is the biggest deterrent, difficulty and obstacle for us to do animal welfare. 

00:06:18.968 --> 00:06:22.787
 Obviously this is completely unnecessary 

00:06:23.017 --> 00:06:24.417
 The government does this unnecessary 

00:06:24.707 --> 00:06:28.219
 I think the worst case, the government can make a concession. 

00:06:28.549 --> 00:06:32.882
 We have us to do it, it has it to do 

00:06:33.183 --> 00:06:36.245
 We don't need government cooperation 

00:06:36.466 --> 00:06:41.026
 Sterilization and resumption in Hong Kong from the very beginning 

00:06:41.307 --> 00:06:43.568
 You don't want to do it doesn't matter 

00:06:43.899 --> 00:06:46.488
 If you have a complaint, you have to catch the dog and kill the dog. 

00:06:46.718 --> 00:06:48.561
 I can't stop it, because this is your policy. 

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:53.193
 But why are you pulling us? 

00:06:53.643 --> 00:06:55.163
 Hong Kong has no rabies for decades 

00:06:55.583 --> 00:06:57.704
 Why are you pulling us? 

00:06:58.664 --> 00:07:02.645
 personal opinion 

00:07:02.995 --> 00:07:07.838
 According to the Government's Anti-Abuse of Animals Act 

00:07:08.497 --> 00:07:16.627
 It’s also illegal to do nothing but make animals suffer. 

00:07:17.107 --> 00:07:22.080
 As long as the government gives up execution 

00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:25.923
 An outdated and unreasonable law is no longer a problem 

00:07:26.502 --> 00:07:33.005
 Very simple, why are you implementing this law? 

00:07:33.536 --> 00:07:36.447
 I am not challenging this current law. 

00:07:36.807 --> 00:07:38.588
 But can you have someone to do it? 

00:07:38.868 --> 00:07:40.399
 Not necessary at all 

00:07:40.809 --> 00:07:44.281
 Dogs and humans have lived together for thousands of years. 

00:07:44.651 --> 00:07:47.265
 But Hong Kong’s managementism is overdeveloped 

00:07:47.675 --> 00:07:51.605
 In addition, there is insufficient education to respect the life of animals. 

00:07:51.885 --> 00:07:53.985
 Causing a large number of animals to die innocent 

00:07:54.326 --> 00:07:59.168
 Finally, the relationship between animals and animals is getting farther and farther
