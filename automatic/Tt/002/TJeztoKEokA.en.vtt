00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:05.360 
anyways so I know I can't do anything to

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:06.750 
anyways so I know I can't do anything to
this<00:03:05.480> so<00:03:05.720> I've<00:03:05.810> switched<00:03:06.019> out<00:03:06.230> here<00:03:06.410> and<00:03:06.560> to<00:03:06.680> my

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
this so I've switched out here and to my

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:11.590 
this so I've switched out here and to my
qett<00:03:08.170> which<00:03:09.170> is<00:03:09.580> my<00:03:10.580> pokémon<00:03:10.910> right<00:03:11.209> here<00:03:11.450> and

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:11.600 
qett which is my pokémon right here and

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:13.690 
qett which is my pokémon right here and
he<00:03:11.630> goes<00:03:11.840> for<00:03:12.019> a<00:03:12.080> will<00:03:12.350> whips<00:03:12.620> will-o'-wisp<00:03:13.310> so

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:13.700 
he goes for a will whips will-o'-wisp so

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.750 
he goes for a will whips will-o'-wisp so
I<00:03:14.060> was<00:03:15.019> wondering<00:03:15.050> why<00:03:15.830> he<00:03:15.860> would<00:03:16.160> do<00:03:16.340> that<00:03:16.370> so

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
I was wondering why he would do that so

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.430 
I was wondering why he would do that so
he<00:03:16.790> probably<00:03:17.269> predicted<00:03:17.750> my<00:03:17.900> switch<00:03:18.230> or

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:18.440 
he probably predicted my switch or

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.289 
he probably predicted my switch or
something<00:03:18.560> like<00:03:18.769> that<00:03:18.829> but<00:03:19.489> they<00:03:19.670> should<00:03:19.910> 14

00:03:20.289 --> 00:03:20.299 
something like that but they should 14

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:22.090 
something like that but they should 14
move<00:03:20.510> just<00:03:20.870> to<00:03:20.959> take<00:03:21.140> me<00:03:21.320> out<00:03:21.380> but<00:03:21.620> anyways<00:03:21.920> I

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:22.100 
move just to take me out but anyways I

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:24.160 
move just to take me out but anyways I
go<00:03:22.430> for<00:03:22.640> nasty<00:03:22.850> nasty<00:03:23.360> part<00:03:23.780> because<00:03:24.079> I

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:24.170 
go for nasty nasty part because I

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:25.930 
go for nasty nasty part because I
thought<00:03:24.320> it<00:03:24.410> was<00:03:24.470> gonna<00:03:24.560> switch<00:03:24.829> out<00:03:24.980> here<00:03:25.220> but

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:25.940 
thought it was gonna switch out here but

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.240 
thought it was gonna switch out here but
he<00:03:26.150> goes<00:03:26.390> for<00:03:26.540> a<00:03:26.600> hidden<00:03:26.870> power<00:03:27.049> ice<00:03:27.320> he<00:03:28.040> should

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:28.250 
he goes for a hidden power ice he should

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:29.890 
he goes for a hidden power ice he should
have<00:03:28.340> one<00:03:28.459> for<00:03:28.670> a<00:03:28.700> far<00:03:29.060> move<00:03:29.239> since<00:03:29.510> it<00:03:29.780> would

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:29.900 
have one for a far move since it would

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:31.810 
have one for a far move since it would
be<00:03:30.079> it<00:03:30.470> would<00:03:30.530> do<00:03:30.709> much<00:03:30.920> more<00:03:31.160> damage<00:03:31.220> in<00:03:31.670> see

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:31.820 
be it would do much more damage in see

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:35.650 
be it would do much more damage in see
as<00:03:31.850> the<00:03:32.269> sunny<00:03:33.140> day<00:03:33.350> and<00:03:33.760> it's<00:03:34.760> down<00:03:35.090> so<00:03:35.450> I

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:35.660 
as the sunny day and it's down so I

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:37.390 
as the sunny day and it's down so I
don't<00:03:35.840> know<00:03:35.900> why<00:03:36.019> we'd<00:03:36.230> do<00:03:36.350> that<00:03:36.530> but<00:03:36.769> it<00:03:37.010> does

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:37.400 
don't know why we'd do that but it does

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.539 
don't know why we'd do that but it does
take<00:03:38.000> me<00:03:38.150> in<00:03:38.209> about<00:03:38.420> half<00:03:38.630> HP<00:03:38.840> so<00:03:39.430> it's<00:03:40.430> pretty

00:03:40.539 --> 00:03:40.549 
take me in about half HP so it's pretty

00:03:40.549 --> 00:03:42.310 
take me in about half HP so it's pretty
good<00:03:40.700> for<00:03:40.760> him<00:03:41.030> and<00:03:41.269> I<00:03:41.570> do<00:03:41.630> get<00:03:41.989> the<00:03:42.110> bird

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:44.500 
good for him and I do get the bird
language<00:03:42.650> so<00:03:42.890> that<00:03:42.920> does<00:03:43.400> even<00:03:43.640> more<00:03:43.850> and<00:03:44.030> I'm

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:44.510 
language so that does even more and I'm

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.650

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950 
blocked and that's gonna do more than

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:51.220 
blocked and that's gonna do more than
half<00:03:49.220> so<00:03:49.489> I'm<00:03:49.700> pretty<00:03:49.880> happy<00:03:50.000> about<00:03:50.239> that<00:03:50.600> but

here because the the reflect wears off

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.260 
here because the the reflect wears off
and<00:04:30.010> if<00:04:31.010> I<00:04:31.220> go<00:04:31.340> for<00:04:31.520> a<00:04:31.550> bullet<00:04:31.820> punch<00:04:31.970> I'm<00:04:32.120> gonna

and his blade kanana predicted that

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.200 
and his blade kanana predicted that
switch<00:04:36.170> till<00:04:36.410> I<00:04:36.620> go<00:04:36.980> for<00:04:37.220> swords<00:04:37.700> lance<00:04:37.970> and

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:38.210 
switch till I go for swords lance and

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:40.660 
switch till I go for swords lance and
turns<00:04:39.110> out<00:04:39.230> to<00:04:39.350> pretty<00:04:39.500> good<00:04:39.620> for<00:04:39.770> me<00:04:39.890> and<00:04:40.070> I

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:40.670 
turns out to pretty good for me and I

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:43.150 
turns out to pretty good for me and I
over<00:04:41.540> predicted<00:04:41.960> here<00:04:42.140> will<00:04:42.320> actually<00:04:42.350> did<00:04:42.920> i

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:43.160 
over predicted here will actually did i

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.160 
over predicted here will actually did i
pricked<00:04:43.730> it<00:04:43.910> really<00:04:44.240> well<00:04:44.420> since<00:04:44.720> he<00:04:44.870> goes<00:04:45.020> for

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:45.170 
pricked it really well since he goes for

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:48.430 
pricked it really well since he goes for
swords<00:04:45.500> nuts<00:04:45.860> so<00:04:46.430> I<00:04:47.050> predicted<00:04:48.050> his

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:48.440 
swords nuts so I predicted his

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:51.190 
swords nuts so I predicted his
prediction<00:04:49.010> so<00:04:49.310> anyways<00:04:50.120> he<00:04:50.630> goes<00:04:50.780> for<00:04:50.960> swords

00:04:51.190 --> 00:04:51.200 
prediction so anyways he goes for swords

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:53.530 
prediction so anyways he goes for swords
dance<00:04:51.410> and<00:04:51.650> right<00:04:52.400> here<00:04:52.580> I<00:04:52.760> thought<00:04:53.000> maybe

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:53.540 
dance and right here I thought maybe

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:56.260

maybe<00:04:53.960> i<00:04:54.170> can<00:04:54.320> get<00:04:54.620> off<00:04:54.800> any<00:04:55.430> bullet<00:04:55.880> punch<00:04:56.060> and

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:56.270 
maybe i can get off any bullet punch and

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:58.750 
maybe i can get off any bullet punch and
take<00:04:56.420> it<00:04:56.540> out<00:04:56.660> and<00:04:56.900> i<00:04:57.440> do<00:04:57.500> cuz<00:04:58.010> i<00:04:58.100> gotta<00:04:58.280> quit<00:04:58.550> so

00:05:00.980 --> 00:05:03.340 
that's really really lucky for me but
really<00:05:01.190> unlucky<00:05:01.820> for<00:05:02.090> him<00:05:02.300> and<00:05:02.480> i<00:05:03.140> don't<00:05:03.320> know
