 Hello, what's up how are you 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:09.089
 we start our theme 

00:00:09.089 --> 00:00:11.639
 we have here on this screen 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:13.419
 in the presentation 

00:00:13.419 --> 00:00:15.129
 from powerpoint 

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:16.779
 already in video clips 

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:18.829
 love asia 

00:00:18.829 --> 00:00:23.399
 this was the recording of ee per hundred a presentation with five days 

00:00:23.399 --> 00:00:24.609
 positive 

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:27.159
 we do not have integrated 

00:00:27.159 --> 00:00:28.589
 at 

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:30.909
 in it palmarÃ©s north clips 

00:00:30.909 --> 00:00:33.340
 kocsis pri 

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.460
 we click 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.980
 to the image of the recording we plan to the timeline 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.880
 we choose the mentions are 2 

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:48.990
 ramos coke 

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:52.350
 and we see that they are integrated here in the timeline 

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:57.540
 the first step to keep in mind asked him to have benefits for 

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:00.050
 bridges and the timeline 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:04.850
 the second very important testicular in audio that is chosen denied when recording the 

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:06.540
 provision of bridge 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.950
 in this video clip 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:12.950
 well we are the fundamental aspects here at this point of the video shown 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.539
 a small circle 

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:17.969
 which indicates the link between claudio 

00:01:17.969 --> 00:01:19.540
 and the video 

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:20.660
 we click 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:24.950
 in this message we are shown that it will permanently erase that 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.920
 Linkage between audio 1 and video 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.450
 we answer them 

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.750
 Kelly is yes 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:36.340
 we observe here at this point that the video of one's side was unlinked 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.310
 so we can another technique on the timeline to the audio 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.340
 and we are going to remove 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.259
 that is the first point they initiate indispensable requirement to go make a 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:50.470
 proper narration 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:52.510
 we start with the narration 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:54.350
 let's send 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.350
 tulsa tools menu 

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:01.360
 we choose the option 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:03.970
 of narration 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:06.270
 i have here 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:08.020
 min two buttons 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.319
 the one who starts the recording 

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.319
 i the one that ausa we are going to call it that 

00:02:14.539 --> 00:02:16.610
 It is also important to verify 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.849
 percent this system that gives delahunt son 

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:21.349
 where are indicated 

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:25.560
 The audio device that we have connected to our computer is 

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.829
 important to verify the ones to make sure that effectively 

00:02:30.469 --> 00:02:31.929
 the filmmaker 

00:02:31.929 --> 00:02:34.769
 xd bando out the recording 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:38.869
 we observe that there is someone who this level shows you the volume 

00:02:38.869 --> 00:02:40.819
 by the perfect color 

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:44.830
 as the country the variation in the volume input 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:46.589
 the microphone 

00:02:46.589 --> 00:02:51.519
 here we have an ethos microphones the pin left with the computer inc a 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:54.519
 second through a serial hub port 

00:02:55.469 --> 00:02:58.469
 let's give you next experience an ex 

00:03:01.579 --> 00:03:06.739
 this is for the state screen it shows a volume this sport the 

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:08.269
 adjustment levels 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:09.769
 there is a point 

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:11.489
 otumba tico de juste 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:14.299
 percent amen 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:17.559
 if level 3 stressed that adopt in this situation 

00:03:18.329 --> 00:03:20.819
 what can we give 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:21.890
 meaning 

00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:24.970
 There are those who took me out of three seconds to operate 

00:03:24.970 --> 00:03:27.629
 approximately one third paragraph 

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:29.610
 to ensure that everything is correct 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:30.799
 Yeah that's right 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:33.590
 Donzis tells us here in a message 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:37.340
 piquer adjustment of these correct tasks let's give you times 

00:03:39.679 --> 00:03:42.769
 let's start with hundred percent this nation 

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:46.489
 we are sad 

00:03:46.489 --> 00:03:49.489
 on the button of this clipping 

00:03:52.999 --> 00:03:55.999
 the act will begin recording our voice 

00:03:56.979 --> 00:04:00.209
 We can see here how TomaticÃ¡n is moving 

00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:04.159
 the head or the indicator 

00:04:04.159 --> 00:04:06.009
 already in the timeline 

00:04:06.009 --> 00:04:10.489
 the same here in the preview image 1 dp preview 

00:04:12.769 --> 00:04:16.799
 sow the advantage of these is a ration and that is that it allows us in your 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:17.959
 moment 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:19.269
 for 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:20.329
 the recording 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:22.349
 giving him who the tap buttons 

00:04:22.349 --> 00:04:23.620
 the green button 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:28.320
 and then start it again without interfering with the minimum 

00:04:28.999 --> 00:04:30.129
 with lass 

00:04:30.129 --> 00:04:32.779
 images that we have recorded 

00:04:32.779 --> 00:04:36.430
 here we go walking a little bit maybe we present a 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:40.430
 A 4t dialogue with SMEs is a topic that postiga 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:43.430
 the benefit of by we expected to accept 

00:04:44.719 --> 00:04:47.559
 min we are going now to cuartar like 

00:04:47.559 --> 00:04:49.559
 the file 

00:04:49.559 --> 00:04:53.839
 This is a file seal of slide packagings 

00:04:54.559 --> 00:04:57.979
 that became precisely for its that com 

00:04:57.979 --> 00:04:59.259
 With so many 

00:04:59.259 --> 00:05:01.629
 we click on peace eta 

00:05:01.629 --> 00:05:04.559
 but lovers we choose the type of files 

00:05:04.559 --> 00:05:07.710
 in this case it is the type of chip image etc 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:10.930
 let's use gel crispÃ³ name of the file 

00:05:12.559 --> 00:05:15.559
 let's see the save button 

00:05:16.599 --> 00:05:20.699
 we are presented with a dialogue box where we indicate that each of the 

00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:22.089
 slideshow 

00:05:22.089 --> 00:05:25.089
 c will record separately as images 

00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:31.760
 finally this two dialog box show the location of the patches 

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:33.749
 of pictures 

00:05:33.749 --> 00:05:36.749
 we give accept 

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:45.809
 we look for more images in these documents 

00:05:45.809 --> 00:05:48.809
 we look for folk-rock 

00:05:49.849 --> 00:05:54.220
 here we see and we find the five post days already converted as 

00:05:54.219 --> 00:05:57.069
 images jokes for use in any 

00:05:57.069 --> 00:05:58.700
 system or program 

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:01.700
 in this specific case for qantas and study 

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:07.480
 this is a small example of how we can create hoist 

00:06:08.339 --> 00:06:11.339
 in the narration 

00:06:12.289 --> 00:06:14.979
 we give her who this example 

00:06:14.979 --> 00:06:16.080
 to record 

00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:18.059
 to stop the narration 

00:06:18.059 --> 00:06:20.599
 in this dialog window min 

00:06:20.599 --> 00:06:22.339
 let's indicate the name 

00:06:22.339 --> 00:06:23.930
 net the file 

00:06:23.930 --> 00:06:26.930
 that we use for the narration 

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:30.520
 flies his simple name na 

00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:33.520
 the occasion 

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:38.069
 this in a 

00:06:38.069 --> 00:06:39.559
 said folder 

00:06:39.559 --> 00:06:40.889
 the handlebar 

00:06:40.889 --> 00:06:41.770
 we 

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:44.770
 6 hugo accepts 

00:06:47.119 --> 00:06:50.119
 this concludes more or less the procedure 

00:06:50.669 --> 00:06:52.860
 simplified of what is a 

00:06:52.860 --> 00:06:55.879
 what is a narrative love studio asia 

00:06:58.830 --> 00:07:00.810
