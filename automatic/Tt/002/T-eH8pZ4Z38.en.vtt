here's<00:00:01.140> something<00:00:01.860> that<00:00:02.070> could<00:00:02.310> be<00:00:02.490> a<00:00:02.669> problem

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:03.090 
here's something that could be a problem

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.670 
here's something that could be a problem
for<00:00:03.830> your<00:00:04.830> stairway<00:00:05.839> and<00:00:06.839> of<00:00:06.990> course<00:00:07.200> it<00:00:07.440> will

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:07.680 
for your stairway and of course it will

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.410 
for your stairway and of course it will
be<00:00:08.840> this<00:00:09.840> any<00:00:10.559> gaps<00:00:10.980> that<00:00:11.219> you<00:00:11.460> have<00:00:11.759> in<00:00:12.179> the

any part of the stairway if you have any
gaps<00:00:21.869> it<00:00:22.080> should<00:00:22.320> be<00:00:22.470> your<00:00:22.619> first<00:00:22.650> clue<00:00:23.369> that

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
gaps it should be your first clue that

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.290 
gaps it should be your first clue that
there<00:00:23.760> might<00:00:23.939> be<00:00:24.000> a<00:00:24.420> problem<00:00:24.779> with<00:00:25.230> the<00:00:26.300> stair

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:49.190 
your landing wasn't built at the right
height<00:00:46.700> then<00:00:47.700> you<00:00:48.180> could<00:00:48.450> get<00:00:48.629> a<00:00:48.660> gap<00:00:48.930> at<00:00:49.170> the

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200

could be the problem could be the floor
the<00:00:54.360> floor<00:00:54.510> could<00:00:54.840> be<00:00:54.989> a<00:00:55.020> little<00:00:55.410> out<00:00:55.590> of<00:00:55.620> whack

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
the floor could be a little out of whack

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.340 
the floor could be a little out of whack
or<00:00:56.399> you<00:00:56.579> could<00:00:56.789> even<00:00:56.910> have<00:00:57.210> a<00:00:57.239> buckle<00:00:57.870> a<00:00:58.050> small

buckle in the flooring you could have a

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.770 
buckle in the flooring you could have a

forget that if you have your stair

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.630 
forget that if you have your stair
stringers<00:01:54.960> cut<00:01:55.259> correctly<00:01:55.680> and<00:01:56.159> you<00:01:56.399> think

stringers cut correctly and you think

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:57.830 
stringers cut correctly and you think
you<00:01:56.729> know<00:01:56.790> what<00:01:57.030> I'm<00:01:57.210> just<00:01:57.420> going<00:01:57.540> to<00:01:57.570> go<00:01:57.750> ahead

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
you know what I'm just going to go ahead

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:00.020 
you know what I'm just going to go ahead
and<00:01:58.110> shave<00:01:58.320> a<00:01:58.350> little<00:01:58.530> bit<00:01:59.070> off<00:01:59.250> of<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.670> front

here and make this flat because I want

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.780 
here and make this flat because I want
it<00:02:02.790> to<00:02:02.909> look<00:02:03.119> good<00:02:03.439> then<00:02:04.439> that<00:02:04.619> could<00:02:05.009> change

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
it to look good then that could change

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.410 
it to look good then that could change
your<00:02:06.450> first<00:02:07.049> step<00:02:07.770> or<00:02:08.009> the<00:02:08.640> height<00:02:08.849> of<00:02:09.119> the

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420 
your first step or the height of the

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.339 
your first step or the height of the
first<00:02:09.720> step<00:02:11.000> from<00:02:12.000> the<00:02:12.180> floor<00:02:12.450> to<00:02:12.480> the<00:02:12.810> top<00:02:12.959> of

00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:13.349 
first step from the floor to the top of

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:13.550 
first step from the floor to the top of
the

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
the

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:16.130 
the
Fred<00:02:13.830> do<00:02:14.160> not<00:02:14.370> forget<00:02:14.760> about<00:02:14.910> that<00:02:15.140> whether

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
Fred do not forget about that whether

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.190 
Fred do not forget about that whether
the<00:02:16.410> gaps<00:02:16.650> in<00:02:16.920> the<00:02:17.010> back<00:02:17.220> I<00:02:17.520> should<00:02:18.060> say<00:02:18.300> in<00:02:18.870> the

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
the gaps in the back I should say in the

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.809 
the gaps in the back I should say in the
in<00:02:19.410> the<00:02:19.620> back<00:02:19.800> of<00:02:19.980> the<00:02:20.069> front<00:02:20.310> but<00:02:20.489> that's<00:02:20.670> not

00:02:20.809 --> 00:02:20.819 
in the back of the front but that's not

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:23.390 
in the back of the front but that's not
true<00:02:21.209> because<00:02:21.989> if<00:02:22.380> you<00:02:22.560> have<00:02:22.770> a<00:02:22.800> gap<00:02:23.099> in<00:02:23.130> the

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
true because if you have a gap in the

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.720 
true because if you have a gap in the
front<00:02:23.819> and<00:02:24.380> your<00:02:25.380> riser<00:02:25.770> was<00:02:26.160> cut<00:02:26.400> correctly

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
front and your riser was cut correctly

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.330 
front and your riser was cut correctly
then<00:02:27.599> it<00:02:27.810> would<00:02:27.930> obviously<00:02:28.110> obviously<00:02:28.709> be<00:02:29.310> a

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
then it would obviously obviously be a

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.259 
then it would obviously obviously be a
little<00:02:29.970> longer<00:02:31.040> so<00:02:32.040> you<00:02:32.099> might<00:02:32.670> need<00:02:32.910> to<00:02:33.060> cut

00:02:33.259 --> 00:02:33.269 
little longer so you might need to cut

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:35.960 
little longer so you might need to cut
the<00:02:33.420> back<00:02:33.630> if<00:02:33.930> that<00:02:34.230> was<00:02:34.500> the<00:02:34.650> case<00:02:34.680> so<00:02:35.550> anyway

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
the back if that was the case so anyway

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.580 
the back if that was the case so anyway
just<00:02:36.150> wanted<00:02:36.269> to<00:02:36.540> point<00:02:36.720> that<00:02:36.870> out<00:02:37.019> if<00:02:37.440> you

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
just wanted to point that out if you

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:41.690 
just wanted to point that out if you
have<00:02:37.769> any<00:02:38.069> gaps<00:02:39.230> in<00:02:40.230> these<00:02:40.590> areas<00:02:40.920> then<00:02:41.580> it

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
have any gaps in these areas then it

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.020 
have any gaps in these areas then it
wouldn't<00:02:41.940> be<00:02:41.970> a<00:02:42.030> bad<00:02:42.209> idea<00:02:42.239> to<00:02:42.599> check<00:02:43.019> out<00:02:44.030> the

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
wouldn't be a bad idea to check out the

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.350 
wouldn't be a bad idea to check out the
steps<00:02:46.019> or<00:02:46.380> the<00:02:46.709> treads<00:02:47.010> before<00:02:47.580> going<00:02:48.000> any

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360 
steps or the treads before going any

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.900 
steps or the treads before going any
further<00:02:48.510> to<00:02:49.019> see<00:02:49.319> if<00:02:49.459> all<00:02:50.459> of<00:02:50.760> your

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
further to see if all of your

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.840 
further to see if all of your
calculations<00:02:51.720> are<00:02:51.930> correct<00:02:52.230> or<00:02:52.709> if<00:02:53.100> anything

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
calculations are correct or if anything

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:58.850 
calculations are correct or if anything
is<00:02:54.090> out<00:02:54.930> of<00:02:54.989> whack<00:02:55.470> or<00:02:55.830> out<00:02:56.190> of<00:02:56.370> level
