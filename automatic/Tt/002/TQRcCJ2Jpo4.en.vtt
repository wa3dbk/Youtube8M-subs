00:04:14.059 --> 00:04:14.069 
every time I had a curved surface I

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:17.449 
every time I had a curved surface I
always<00:04:14.849> wind<00:04:15.120> up<00:04:15.650> getting<00:04:16.650> a<00:04:16.769> little<00:04:16.950> bit<00:04:17.099> too

00:04:17.449 --> 00:04:17.459

deep<00:04:17.930> and<00:04:18.930> I've<00:04:19.079> already<00:04:19.289> crushed<00:04:19.709> this<00:04:19.919> up

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 
deep and I've already crushed this up

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.820 
deep and I've already crushed this up
and<00:04:20.370> rescinded<00:04:21.030> it<00:04:21.150> and<00:04:21.419> again<00:04:21.989> but<00:04:22.440> I<00:04:22.470> went<00:04:22.740> to

00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:22.830 
and rescinded it and again but I went to

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:25.520
