00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:15.260
 our little mini tractor made 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:22.010
 home conditions serve faithfully 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:28.189
 probably years 18 years every year 

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:28.189
 until being worked through 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:47.960
 let's start with the main engine 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:47.960
 ud-2 power 8 horsepower he 

00:00:51.110 --> 00:01:04.260
 connected to the box at the gas-51 

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:08.340
 standing across the frame with gears here 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:18.170
 there is a clutch and drive from 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:18.170
 engine box from the box is arranged

 chain transmission on the rear to the rear axle 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:57.990
 the rear axle is composed called mom knew 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:02:00.060
 Drum our stars I in diameter 58 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:06.410
 teeth on this shaft 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:11.340
 planted two wheels which are both leading 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:17.209
 he is always blocked we will lower now 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:17.209
 hitch you look like 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.650
 everything is arranged there 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:03:04.120
 here stands razdatka razdatka connected 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:10.080
 with oil pump the oil pump serves 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:10.080
 for hydraulic lifting 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:21.510
 knife cylinder knife front and back 

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:32.220
 whole thread with a cylinder and with 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:38.160
 time show how raises the cart 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:44.910
 also with a lift distributor 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:44.910
 is under the seat all covered with snow 

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:50.730
 here is the distributor 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:50.730
 two-piece 

00:03:53.520 --> 00:04:04.680
 this year put a starter with a drive 

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:07.190
 flywheel puskacha and become bloom 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:12.150
 here will be 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:28.970
 the battery is fixed just installed 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:31.740
 the generator here is the oil sensor 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:36.920
 this temperature will stand it now 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:41.250
 broken crown and light bulb 

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:49.740
 indicating the work of the generator gas tank 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:58.550
 Naturally, this is an oil tank for 

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:58.550
 hydraulics with time scum how will 

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:06.200
 try to make it work
