00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:34.420
 hello everyone, inexorably running forward 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:37.150
 and now two thirds of the summer 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:39.489
 left behind in front of us waiting 

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:41.890
 game 2013 in which the company 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:42.790
 blizzard promises something big and 

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:44.950
 after 

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:46.150
 autumn with its leaf fall and a bunch 

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:49.030
 long-awaited new products 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:51.010
 well, we still continue to talk 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:53.470
 on the similarity of various projects 

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:57.930
 media areas and today we talk about 

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:57.930
 the headlight game edge 3 and the beach movie 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.900
 each of us perceives the games in their own way 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:15.450
 for someone it's a way to relieve stress 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.970
 having landed a couple of both in virtual 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.610
 an enemy for someone the opportunity to experience 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.460
 unforgettable sensations pressing the gas pedal 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.590
 to the floor of an expensive sports car well for 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:28.259
 some games are a way to go there 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.960
 where for one reason or another not being 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:33.930
 it seems possible that's why 

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:36.720
 I spent the headlights edge 3 gray November 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:41.220
 weekday tropical island open world 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:45.450
 great graphics but but you already know what 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:47.430
 I will say it well, and the reason for this was 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:50.820
 film beach with leonardo dicaprio in the main 

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:54.050
 the roles that appeared on the screens of 13 years 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:58.080
 back well let's go to the details 

00:01:54.050 --> 00:02:00.509
 first with this fictional tropical 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:03.119
 Paradise Headlights Edge 3 has the name of the hands and 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:03.659
 based on represented in the game flora and 

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.820
 fauna 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:08.580
 located in the atlantic ocean somewhere 

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.830
 between thailand and papua new guinea 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.940
 by the way the real island with the name of the hands 

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:16.560
 exists and is about the same 

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:18.900
 Film beach turn was shot on 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:19.739
 island phi phi lei krabi republic 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:22.110
 Thailand 

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:24.690
 the fun fact is that after 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:27.360
 filming the movie island got a middle name 

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.920
 island leonardo dicaprio is 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:30.769
 local landmark 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.670
 on par with James Bond Island 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:33.989
 got their middle name by 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:36.120
 similar reason 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:38.010
 as you already understood from the above 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.170
 actions like the movie and the game 

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:43.260
 occur about the same 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:45.190
 second place of the globe 

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.020
 characters 

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.390
 in both stories the main characters 

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.870
 are young people who want 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.480
 to experience 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.800
 something more than standard rest in 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:56.230
 hotel by the sea 

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.210
 caught thirst for adventure they 

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:01.300
 find themselves on islands where already 

00:02:58.210 --> 00:03:04.360
 antagonist storylines develop 

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:06.670
 also share the similar features of headlights edge 3 

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:09.070
 introduces us to the whole army the most that 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:11.590
 on there are pirates haggling their people 

00:03:09.070 --> 00:03:13.110
 in your free time, well, the movie beach 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:15.430
 presents to our attention 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:17.470
 drug traffickers whom we are clearly not 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:22.480
 like when their island appear 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:26.640
 new faces do not like much but you 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.640
 don't wait for this to hear that 

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:32.069
 what a madness 

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:34.410
 the symbol of madness which has become a favorite 

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:35.370
 psychopath you present in the film as much in 

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:38.069
 two options 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:40.380
 first name is duffy it is he who becomes 

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:42.300
 the reason why the main characters 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:46.050
 go in search of the island 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:49.680
 you are just a rotten apparatus concept for 

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:52.170
 thrust well and the second so here it is necessary 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:54.450
 conduct a little explanation of the matter in 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:57.209
 that the one that became you 

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:59.730
 the main symbol of headlights edge 3 was originally 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:00.870
 was conceived as a character with a completely 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:03.780
 a different character 

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:06.030
 however thanks michael man up to actor 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:08.840
 who played his role appeared before you 

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:11.100
 as we know 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:13.860
 the original concept assumed 

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:16.650
 gloomy silent but all this already 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:18.720
 ill saying actually exactly such 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:23.640
 and is the leader of the drug dealer in 

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:25.710
 the movie beach is the third plot if 

00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:28.230
 consider the plot of the game and motion pictures 

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:30.620
 In short, you get something like this. 

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:33.500
 chain of events hit the island 

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:36.630
 stumbled upon local bad guys 

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:39.360
 fled stumbled upon the local good 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:41.700
 the guys that became friends went against 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:44.160
 bad guys well and in the end the ending 

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:46.350
 Of course, the edge of the edge 3 offers us 

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:49.470
 a lot more action shootings and 

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:51.270
 bloodshed but Leonardo killed 

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:53.600
 sharks before it even became 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:53.600
 mainstream 

00:04:55.610 --> 00:05:01.080
 summarizing it is worth noting that despite 

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:03.810
 all parallels movie beach and game far 

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:06.060
 cry 3 are similar only in terms of concept 

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:07.860
 Yes, the game has many references to 

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:10.620
 films that suggest that 

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:13.379
 developers inspired by seven however 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:16.050
 headlight edge 3 has its own set of ideas and 

00:05:13.379 --> 00:05:18.060
 stories as if there were any if the game 

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:21.300
 I came to your taste I advise to look 

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:23.310
 film beach at this all do not forget 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:25.199

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:27.630
 movies and games from the TV series in your opinion 

00:05:25.199 --> 00:05:30.240
