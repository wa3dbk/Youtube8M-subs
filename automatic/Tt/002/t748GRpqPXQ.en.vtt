think I recorded this with around an

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:50.289 
think I recorded this with around an
hour<00:01:48.799> of<00:01:49.039> play<00:01:49.220> time<00:01:49.490> to<00:01:49.640> my<00:01:49.729> credit<00:01:50.000> so<00:01:50.270> I

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:50.299 
hour of play time to my credit so I

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:51.550 
hour of play time to my credit so I
haven't<00:01:50.689> quite<00:01:50.810> mastered<00:01:51.079> the<00:01:51.380> game's

mechanics<00:01:51.820> but<00:01:52.820> the<00:01:52.909> bigger<00:01:53.210> disservice<00:01:53.600> is

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:53.930 
mechanics but the bigger disservice is

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:54.969 
mechanics but the bigger disservice is
the<00:01:54.020> fact<00:01:54.259> that<00:01:54.320> I'm<00:01:54.470> playing<00:01:54.770> this<00:01:54.890> game

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:54.979 
the fact that I'm playing this game

00:01:57.669 --> 00:01:57.679 
offline by myself I did this in order to

00:01:57.679 --> 00:01:59.679 
offline by myself I did this in order to
avoid<00:01:57.799> a<00:01:58.039> drop<00:01:58.340> match<00:01:58.580> or<00:01:58.909> maybe<00:01:59.210> finding<00:01:59.570> a

00:01:59.679 --> 00:01:59.689 
avoid a drop match or maybe finding a

me<00:02:01.549> the<00:02:01.670> entire<00:02:01.880> time<00:02:01.939> I<00:02:02.179> recorded<00:02:02.630> the

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.720 
me the entire time I recorded the

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.690 
me the entire time I recorded the
gameplay<00:02:03.140> the<00:02:03.679> community<00:02:04.070> so<00:02:04.220> far<00:02:04.460> has<00:02:04.549> been

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.700 
gameplay the community so far has been

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.429 
gameplay the community so far has been
awesome<00:02:04.880> but<00:02:05.240> this<00:02:05.750> is<00:02:05.899> the<00:02:06.049> internet<00:02:06.409> and

people are crazy so I figured it'd be

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:11.920 
people are crazy so I figured it'd be
best<00:02:09.619> not<00:02:09.739> to<00:02:09.979> risk<00:02:10.330> piling<00:02:11.330> on<00:02:11.480> with<00:02:11.660> someone

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:11.930
