00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
physical products maybe some of you

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:45.260 
physical products maybe some of you
would<00:01:43.380> like<00:01:43.500> to<00:01:43.860> have<00:01:43.950> a<00:01:44.009> physical<00:01:44.189> product<00:01:44.610> at

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
would like to have a physical product at

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.749 
would like to have a physical product at
a<00:01:45.329> minimal<00:01:45.689> price<00:01:45.900> so<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:47.070> physical<00:01:47.430> product

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
a minimal price so the physical product

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.210 
a minimal price so the physical product
would<00:01:47.850> probably<00:01:48.420> run<00:01:48.650> between<00:01:49.650> ten<00:01:50.189> and

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
would probably run between ten and

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.069 
would probably run between ten and
twenty<00:01:50.400> dollars<00:01:50.939> for<00:01:51.210> the<00:01:51.299> manual<00:01:51.720> I<00:01:51.810> think

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
twenty dollars for the manual I think

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.990 
twenty dollars for the manual I think
and<00:01:52.259> if<00:01:52.770> it<00:01:53.130> was<00:01:53.250> going<00:01:53.430> to<00:01:53.490> be<00:01:53.549> shipped<00:01:53.790> with<00:01:53.970> a

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
and if it was going to be shipped with a

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.330 
and if it was going to be shipped with a
DVD<00:01:54.500> that<00:01:55.500> would<00:01:55.950> be<00:01:56.369> a<00:01:56.399> little<00:01:56.579> bit<00:01:56.759> as<00:01:56.880> well

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
DVD that would be a little bit as well

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.160 
DVD that would be a little bit as well
