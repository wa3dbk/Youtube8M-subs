on<00:02:58.630> grass<00:02:58.930> right<00:02:59.260> on<00:02:59.380> sand<00:02:59.650> it<00:03:00.640> gets<00:03:00.940> a<00:03:01.030> lot

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
on grass right on sand it gets a lot

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:02.430 
on grass right on sand it gets a lot
better<00:03:01.210> and<00:03:01.570> better<00:03:01.630> and<00:03:01.960> easier<00:03:02.110> and<00:03:02.350> then

better and better and easier and then

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:07.020 
better and better and easier and then
eventually<00:03:02.650> concrete<00:03:03.550> is<00:03:05.520> just<00:03:06.520> an<00:03:06.790> illusion

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.030
