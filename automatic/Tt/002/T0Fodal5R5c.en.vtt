of course but the reason she was staying

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:05.959 
of course but the reason she was staying
in<00:02:04.649> this<00:02:04.740> is<00:02:04.950> because<00:02:05.219> we<00:02:05.369> had<00:02:05.490> to<00:02:05.579> keep<00:02:05.729> her

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
in this is because we had to keep her

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:08.690 
in this is because we had to keep her
warm<00:02:06.630> and<00:02:06.990> comfortable<00:02:07.890> so<00:02:08.160> she<00:02:08.220> could<00:02:08.489> heal

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
warm and comfortable so she could heal

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.029 
warm and comfortable so she could heal
so<00:02:09.360> or<00:02:09.720> so<00:02:10.140> she<00:02:10.200> could<00:02:10.470> heal<00:02:10.619> the<00:02:10.739> best<00:02:10.920> she

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
so or so she could heal the best she

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.080 
so or so she could heal the best she
could<00:02:11.220> so<00:02:11.790> it<00:02:11.849> needed<00:02:12.030> to<00:02:12.150> be<00:02:12.330> a<00:02:12.360> small<00:02:12.660> space

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:13.090 
could so it needed to be a small space

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.059 
could so it needed to be a small space
she<00:02:13.269> didn't<00:02:13.480> have<00:02:13.569> to<00:02:13.690> travel<00:02:13.930> too<00:02:14.170> far<00:02:14.200> and

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:15.069 
she didn't have to travel too far and

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:17.280 
she didn't have to travel too far and

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:24.310 
so yeah it's a bit of a difficult

00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:29.009 
so yeah it's a bit of a difficult
situation<00:03:24.549> because<00:03:25.950> she's<00:03:26.950> now<00:03:27.819> so<00:03:28.450> ill<00:03:28.690> and

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:29.019 
situation because she's now so ill and

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:30.920 
situation because she's now so ill and
because<00:03:29.680> of<00:03:29.709> her<00:03:29.859> age<00:03:30.069> and<00:03:30.310> everything<00:03:30.700> that

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
because of her age and everything that

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.210 
because of her age and everything that
is<00:03:31.930> unlikely<00:03:32.500> she's<00:03:32.739> going<00:03:32.980> to<00:03:33.069> get<00:03:33.160> better

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
is unlikely she's going to get better

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.449 
is unlikely she's going to get better
from<00:03:33.549> this<00:03:33.790> and<00:03:34.139> she<00:03:35.139> could<00:03:35.349> actually<00:03:35.500> go<00:03:35.920> any

00:03:36.449 --> 00:03:36.459 
from this and she could actually go any

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:38.460 
from this and she could actually go any
day<00:03:36.730> now<00:03:37.480> what<00:03:37.630> I'm<00:03:37.780> worried<00:03:38.049> about<00:03:38.109> right<00:03:38.290> now

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:38.470 
day now what I'm worried about right now

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.740 
day now what I'm worried about right now
of<00:03:38.739> course<00:03:38.920> is<00:03:39.190> that<00:03:39.340> a<00:03:39.579> lot<00:03:40.239> of<00:03:40.269> people<00:03:40.569> know

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.750 
of course is that a lot of people know

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.289 
of course is that a lot of people know
when<00:03:40.959> hamsters<00:03:41.410> go<00:03:41.530> to<00:03:41.590> pass<00:03:41.859> away<00:03:42.120> they'll<00:03:43.120> be

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:43.299 
when hamsters go to pass away they'll be

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:44.640 
when hamsters go to pass away they'll be
really<00:03:43.660> ill<00:03:43.900> for<00:03:44.079> a<00:03:44.109> couple<00:03:44.260> of<00:03:44.290> days<00:03:44.410> and

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.650 
really ill for a couple of days and

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:46.949 
really ill for a couple of days and
right<00:03:44.859> before<00:03:45.010> they<00:03:45.280> go<00:03:45.459> they<00:03:46.419> have<00:03:46.599> a<00:03:46.630> sudden

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:46.959 
right before they go they have a sudden

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:50.190 
right before they go they have a sudden
burst<00:03:47.260> of<00:03:47.560> energy<00:03:47.709> and<00:03:48.630> I<00:03:49.630> am<00:03:49.780> a<00:03:49.810> little

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:50.200 
burst of energy and I am a little

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:54.750 
burst of energy and I am a little
concerned<00:03:50.500> about<00:03:53.160> the<00:03:54.160> fact<00:03:54.370> that<00:03:54.489> she's
