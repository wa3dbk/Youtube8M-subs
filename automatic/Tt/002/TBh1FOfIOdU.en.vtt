00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:23.939 
hunting Turkey especially shot placement
you<00:00:22.869> look<00:00:23.019> at<00:00:23.140> why<00:00:23.259> there's<00:00:23.499> been<00:00:23.650> so<00:00:23.830> much

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:23.949 
you look at why there's been so much

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:26.279 
you look at why there's been so much
confusion<00:00:24.220> as<00:00:24.939> where<00:00:25.119> to<00:00:25.269> shoot<00:00:25.449> a<00:00:25.599> turkey<00:00:26.109> I

confusion as where to shoot a turkey I

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:28.710 
confusion as where to shoot a turkey I
guess<00:00:27.009> it<00:00:27.249> probably<00:00:27.550> started<00:00:28.240> with<00:00:28.359> the<00:00:28.509> first

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:28.720 
guess it probably started with the first

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.050 
guess it probably started with the first
people<00:00:29.289> that<00:00:29.320> bow<00:00:29.560> hunting<00:00:29.919> turkeys<00:00:30.369> years

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:31.060 
people that bow hunting turkeys years

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:33.810 
people that bow hunting turkeys years
ago<00:00:31.449> with<00:00:32.380> the<00:00:32.529> equipment<00:00:32.860> they<00:00:33.190> were<00:00:33.340> using

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:33.820 
ago with the equipment they were using

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:35.310 
ago with the equipment they were using
they<00:00:33.940> advocated<00:00:34.510> shooting<00:00:34.810> them<00:00:34.930> in<00:00:34.989> the<00:00:35.050> butt

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.950 
they advocated shooting them in the butt
of<00:00:35.470> the<00:00:35.500> wing<00:00:35.739> and<00:00:36.160> I'd<00:00:36.280> place<00:00:36.730> a<00:00:37.180> lot<00:00:37.780> of<00:00:37.809> the

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:37.960 
of the wing and I'd place a lot of the

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:40.500 
of the wing and I'd place a lot of the
blame<00:00:38.170> on<00:00:38.440> the<00:00:38.789> manufacturers<00:00:39.789> of<00:00:39.879> the

targets you've got paper targets that's
been<00:00:43.930> around<00:00:44.050> for<00:00:44.530> years<00:00:44.699> the<00:00:45.699> vital<00:00:46.090> cavity

00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:46.570 
been around for years the vital cavity

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:48.599 
been around for years the vital cavity
has<00:00:46.719> drawn<00:00:47.109> up<00:00:47.320> in<00:00:47.469> the<00:00:47.559> wrong<00:00:47.710> place<00:00:47.769> on<00:00:48.399> them

00:00:48.599 --> 00:00:48.609 
has drawn up in the wrong place on them

00:00:48.609 --> 00:00:50.490 
has drawn up in the wrong place on them
and<00:00:48.910> then<00:00:49.030> you've<00:00:49.180> got<00:00:49.359> the<00:00:49.539> new<00:00:49.690> newer<00:00:49.870> 3d

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:50.500 
and then you've got the new newer 3d

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:53.009 
and then you've got the new newer 3d
targets<00:00:51.129> are<00:00:51.340> not<00:00:51.879> in<00:00:52.149> exactly<00:00:52.480> the<00:00:52.840> right

00:00:53.009 --> 00:00:53.019

but if you get high high and back right
all<00:01:25.479> in<00:01:25.659> this<00:01:25.990> area<00:01:26.500> all<00:01:27.100> up<00:01:27.369> to<00:01:27.549> here<00:01:28.110> you're

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:29.110 
all in this area all up to here you're

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:32.130 
all in this area all up to here you're
gonna<00:01:29.290> recover<00:01:29.740> the<00:01:29.950> bird<00:01:30.159> every<00:01:30.549> time<00:01:30.790> so<00:01:31.329> and

gonna recover the bird every time so and

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.709 
gonna recover the bird every time so and
then<00:01:32.619> the<00:01:32.890> big<00:01:33.189> mechanicals<00:01:33.939> just<00:01:34.210> up<00:01:34.450> your

00:01:34.709 --> 00:01:34.719 
then the big mechanicals just up your

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:38.819 
then the big mechanicals just up your
odds<00:01:34.930> they<00:01:36.479> expand<00:01:37.479> the<00:01:37.689> vital<00:01:38.140> cavity<00:01:38.680> and

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:38.829 
odds they expand the vital cavity and

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:41.550 
odds they expand the vital cavity and
make<00:01:38.950> it<00:01:39.070> larger<00:01:39.549> than<00:01:39.579> it<00:01:39.850> really<00:01:40.030> is<00:01:40.240> and<00:01:40.869> you

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
make it larger than it really is and you

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.560 
make it larger than it really is and you
throw<00:01:41.890> and<00:01:42.070> you<00:01:42.130> got<00:01:42.280> the<00:01:42.460> spine<00:01:42.759> in<00:01:43.119> there<00:01:43.329> you

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.570 
throw and you got the spine in there you

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.039 
throw and you got the spine in there you
got<00:01:43.780> the<00:01:43.930> thighs<00:01:44.430> that<00:01:45.430> are<00:01:45.729> in<00:01:46.479> the<00:01:46.630> way<00:01:46.810> of

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:47.049 
got the thighs that are in the way of

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:49.740 
got the thighs that are in the way of

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.090 
of my RS end up hitting the thigh

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:55.350 
of my RS end up hitting the thigh
breaking<00:01:52.899> it<00:01:53.049> or<00:01:53.460> severely<00:01:54.460> damaging<00:01:55.240> the
