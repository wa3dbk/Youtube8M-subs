however the juggling is loving most
people<00:00:10.440> hugged<00:00:10.710> in<00:00:11.099> one<00:00:11.340> minute<00:00:11.670> the<00:00:11.790> current

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
people hugged in one minute the current

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.279 
people hugged in one minute the current
record<00:00:12.509> is<00:00:12.719> 55<00:00:13.650> hoax<00:00:14.370> in<00:00:14.940> one<00:00:15.900> minute<00:00:16.170> the

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:16.289 
record is 55 hoax in one minute the

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:18.410 
record is 55 hoax in one minute the
rules<00:00:16.529> our<00:00:16.770> arms<00:00:17.340> must<00:00:17.520> go<00:00:17.730> completely<00:00:18.150> around

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:18.420 
rules our arms must go completely around

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:29.919 
rules our arms must go completely around
each<00:00:18.840> other<00:00:19.050> example<00:00:20.039> of<00:00:20.160> that<00:00:20.189> would<00:00:20.580> be

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:29.929 

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:31.759 

obviously<00:00:30.929> it<00:00:31.019> will<00:00:31.080> be<00:00:31.199> short<00:00:31.439> of<00:00:31.560> that

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
obviously it will be short of that

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.850 
obviously it will be short of that
two-bit<00:00:32.130> 55<00:00:32.790> min<00:00:33.059> and<00:00:33.899> you<00:00:34.140> don't<00:00:34.380> get<00:00:34.559> one

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
two-bit 55 min and you don't get one

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.680 
two-bit 55 min and you don't get one
main<00:00:35.070> person<00:00:35.520> to<00:00:35.640> give<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:35.880> hug<00:00:36.059> so<00:00:36.329> we'll<00:00:36.480> try

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
main person to give the hug so we'll try

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.270 
main person to give the hug so we'll try
this<00:00:36.750> again<00:00:36.930> maybe<00:00:37.559> three<00:00:37.860> times<00:00:38.040> that

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
this again maybe three times that

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.010 
this again maybe three times that
setting<00:00:38.550> a<00:00:38.579> bit<00:00:38.730> of<00:00:38.820> each<00:00:38.940> one<00:00:39.210> to<00:00:39.690> the<00:00:39.780> stand

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
setting a bit of each one to the stand

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.170 
setting a bit of each one to the stand
up<00:00:40.140> to<00:00:40.260> make<00:00:40.350> it<00:00:40.469> easy<00:00:40.590> so<00:00:41.399> we<00:00:41.760> need<00:00:41.879> to<00:00:42.000> work

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
up to make it easy so we need to work

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.950 
up to make it easy so we need to work
out<00:00:42.360> as<00:00:42.719> a<00:00:42.780> team<00:00:43.379> now<00:00:43.649> that<00:00:44.520> we<00:00:45.420> came<00:00:45.629> up<00:00:45.690> with

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
out as a team now that we came up with

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.630 
out as a team now that we came up with
two<00:00:46.140> theories<00:00:46.500> of<00:00:46.620> how<00:00:46.920> we<00:00:46.980> should<00:00:47.160> do<00:00:47.460> this

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
two theories of how we should do this

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.260 
two theories of how we should do this
number<00:00:48.059> one<00:00:48.270> is<00:00:49.309> the<00:00:50.309> person<00:00:50.730> who's<00:00:51.000> getting

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
number one is the person who's getting

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.510 
number one is the person who's getting
hugged<00:00:51.539> to<00:00:52.020> stand<00:00:52.350> here<00:00:52.559> and<00:00:52.829> people<00:00:52.980> who<00:00:53.250> in<00:00:53.460> a

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:53.520 
hugged to stand here and people who in a

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.819 
hugged to stand here and people who in a
line<00:00:54.559> number<00:00:55.559> two<00:00:55.949> was<00:00:56.370> the<00:00:57.590> people<00:00:58.590> being

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
line number two was the people being

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.770 
line number two was the people being
hugged<00:00:59.190> all<00:00:59.520> stand<00:00:59.910> in<00:01:00.030> line<00:01:00.210> like<00:01:00.390> that<00:01:00.449> so

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:00.780 
hugged all stand in line like that so

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.840 
hugged all stand in line like that so
the<00:01:00.930> hugger<00:01:01.109> goes<00:01:01.410> like<00:01:01.680> this<00:01:01.859> like<00:01:02.340> this<00:01:02.370> like

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
the hugger goes like this like this like

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.219 
the hugger goes like this like this like
this<00:01:03.059> like<00:01:03.539> this<00:01:03.809> like<00:01:04.290> this<00:01:05.450> first<00:01:06.450> theory<00:01:07.020> or

00:01:07.219 --> 00:01:07.229 
this like this like this first theory or

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:20.450 
this like this like this first theory or
second<00:01:07.619> theory<00:01:11.299> first<00:01:16.759> first<00:01:17.759> one<00:01:19.280> okay<00:01:20.280> well

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
second theory first first one okay well

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.130 
second theory first first one okay well
we<00:01:20.580> got<00:01:20.759> three<00:01:20.970> attempts<00:01:21.450> so<00:01:21.600> I'm<00:01:21.810> going<00:01:22.049> to

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
we got three attempts so I'm going to

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.590 
we got three attempts so I'm going to
try<00:01:22.350> the<00:01:22.409> first<00:01:22.799> theory<00:01:23.220> so<00:01:24.000> if<00:01:24.330> everyone

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
try the first theory so if everyone

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:25.969 
try the first theory so if everyone
wouldn't<00:01:24.900> mind<00:01:25.140> but<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.500> people<00:01:25.830> in<00:01:25.890> the

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
wouldn't mind but the people in the

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.950 
wouldn't mind but the people in the
front<00:01:26.159> row<00:01:26.310> if<00:01:26.759> we<00:01:26.909> can<00:01:27.060> just<00:01:27.090> stand<00:01:27.450> up<00:01:27.689> just

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
front row if we can just stand up just

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.630 
front row if we can just stand up just
the<00:01:28.140> people<00:01:28.409> in<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.560> front<00:01:28.710> row<00:01:28.920> or<00:01:29.220> anyone

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
the people in the front row or anyone

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.100 
the people in the front row or anyone
else<00:01:29.820> you<00:01:29.939> want<00:01:30.150> stymied<00:01:30.479> by<00:01:30.840> a<00:01:30.869> juggler

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:33.110 
else you want stymied by a juggler

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.219 
else you want stymied by a juggler
hoping<00:01:34.110> I'll<00:01:34.200> say<00:01:34.350> god<00:01:34.560> oh<00:01:35.630> and<00:01:36.630> if<00:01:37.079> we

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
hoping I'll say god oh and if we

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.210 
hoping I'll say god oh and if we
actually<00:01:37.590> make<00:01:37.770> a<00:01:37.799> line<00:01:38.100> on<00:01:38.369> stage<00:01:40.220> Tuesday

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
actually make a line on stage Tuesday

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.569 
actually make a line on stage Tuesday
and<00:01:41.460> ads<00:01:41.610> will<00:01:41.850> join<00:01:42.060> in<00:01:42.240> as<00:01:42.360> well<00:01:43.369> to<00:01:44.369> make<00:01:44.520> a

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
and ads will join in as well to make a

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:49.969 
and ads will join in as well to make a
line<00:01:44.880> I'm<00:01:45.210> going<00:01:45.240> to<00:01:45.420> stand<00:01:45.689> over<00:01:46.170> here<00:01:48.979> that's

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:49.979 
line I'm going to stand over here that's

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:55.550 
line I'm going to stand over here that's
