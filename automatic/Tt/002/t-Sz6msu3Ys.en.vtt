00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:08.430
 So we have two here now 

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:11.570
 introduced with the new ford focus 

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:14.700
 as you can see now have a big one 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:16.650
 8 inch touch screen and we have the 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:18.210
 main functions telephone navigation 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.300
 Air conditioning and entertainment right on 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:23.849
 The top surface was four 

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:27.119
 corner quali if you press on it 

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:28.310
 you're right in the right menu we have 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.050
 here, of course, no gps reception 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:32.660
 air conditioner 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.940
 entertainment 

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:35.650
 and telephone 

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:36.700
 the coolest feature 

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:39.060
 he is not the touchscreen 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:41.290
 but the language recognition now 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:42.610
 almost a natural conversation with the 

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:43.720
 System allows we have the system is 

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:44.110
 in english and in german that works 

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.280
 just like that 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:47.280
 you can say then 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.780
 playstation 3 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.649
 next to tbb 

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:07.260
 Of course he sees himself now 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:09.550
 London as he set as a salt 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:13.030
 because then we can have the GPS reception 

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:16.690
 You can also mixed language or 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:18.250
 prestige the coolest now too 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:19.690
 directly through our points of interest 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.580
 and the michelin travel guide directly the 

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:24.160
 phone number in there but I can 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:26.610
 now say cool and call directly 

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:31.820
 For example , make a reservation 

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:31.820
 and then they say the destination 

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:35.680
 that the humans 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.580
 that is of course extremely easy 

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.960
 right on a city where you look 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.610
 not at all know how in Barcelona 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.990
 for example , now can restaurant 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.130
 find and go there as very convenient 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:48.920
 the same works with parking lots 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:51.040
 with the band with pretty much all pos 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.440
 then you can go here 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.550
 which was always difficult, for example 

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.230
 or what we all find difficult 

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:58.420
 felt was the address 

00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:00.009
 to enter while you are driving 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.850
 we also let it be extremely simple 

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:04.890
 said now 

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.980
 was standing 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.039
 destination address 

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:11.310
 co 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:11.310
 People 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.870
 from piccadilly circus land 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:30.560
 watching you say say say say say say 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.910
 something 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.400
 the destination 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.129
 and you see 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:39.290
 dense munich I did not need the 

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:40.970
 to say street separately from the city 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.290
 before or the house number again separately 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:44.390
 but I could do that in one 

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:46.640
 say what makes it easy to one 

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:49.090
 address to navigate without the gaze 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:51.290
 to take from the street 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:55.690
 as well as I can my air conditioning 

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.690
 Control the save me on 17 5 degrees 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:01.600
 with tampa bay rays 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.960
 O 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:07.160
 said the grease 

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:08.170
 now 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.500
 O 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:11.930
 If you 

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.750
 Marcel miracles perfectly at 20 degrees 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:14.010
 bound 

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.680
 the same is with the music i have 

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:18.960
 my phone is connected to the iphone im 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:22.710
 cable charging here too is also a power 

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:24.660
 tools report download the iphone and can 

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:25.920
 my music on it even it is running 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.600
 just old and dusty i could 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:33.020
 Now go and say 

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:33.020
 the safeway bang bang 

00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:40.290
 I knew I say place on track 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:42.480
 playback and then it works 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.610
 that is also one 

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:46.980
 a huge step forward that me 

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:48.200
 now the commands are more or less free 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.989
 can give 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.379
 the same with mine 

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:53.050
 Phone contacts I can for example 

00:03:51.379 --> 00:03:58.230
 just say it now 

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:58.230
 psn card to be 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:09.790
 I would like it annoying that I always 

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:11.680
 a million calls fit 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:13.670
 The system can indeed synonymous with 

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:15.799
 read short messages and that means 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:18.229
 an sms comes then will be read to you 

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:19.250
 You can also turn that off under 

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:20.660
 circumstances too 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:22.010
 Difficulties lead when you have yours 

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:24.320
 girlfriend next to the seat then you have 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:25.910
 you switch off so do not be here 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:28.960
 disturb then no more calls come 

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:28.960
 still no linguistic
