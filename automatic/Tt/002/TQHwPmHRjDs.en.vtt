so<00:00:35.640> you<00:00:36.059> just<00:00:36.300> basically<00:00:36.510> fold<00:00:37.440> in<00:00:37.710> two<00:00:38.070> pieces

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
so you just basically fold in two pieces

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.520 
so you just basically fold in two pieces
of<00:00:38.550> paper<00:00:38.730> or<00:00:38.969> you<00:00:39.329> can<00:00:39.540> use<00:00:39.690> more<00:00:39.930> obviously

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
of paper or you can use more obviously

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.229 
of paper or you can use more obviously
and<00:00:40.950> you<00:00:41.250> just<00:00:41.430> have<00:00:41.579> to<00:00:41.640> prop<00:00:41.910> them<00:00:42.149> up

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
and you just have to prop them up

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.180 
and you just have to prop them up
somehow<00:00:42.510> so<00:00:42.660> they<00:00:43.140> stand<00:00:43.530> upright<00:00:43.739> so<00:00:44.070> when

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
somehow so they stand upright so when

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.220 
somehow so they stand upright so when
you<00:00:44.280> put<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.550> butterfly<00:00:44.820> in<00:00:45.059> its<00:00:45.600> gonna<00:00:45.840> stay

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
you put the butterfly in its gonna stay

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
like that so it can dry or chocolate in

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:52.400 
like that so it can dry or chocolate in
this<00:00:49.559> case<00:00:49.800> harden<00:00:50.250> in<00:00:50.940> that<00:00:51.449> position<00:00:51.690> I'm

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
this case harden in that position I'm

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:53.869 
this case harden in that position I'm
gonna<00:00:52.680> be<00:00:52.829> using<00:00:52.980> this<00:00:53.219> template<00:00:53.610> you<00:00:53.730> can
