what<00:01:42.450> we're<00:01:42.630> doing<00:01:42.930> in<00:01:43.530> a<00:01:43.650> program<00:01:44.070> called

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
what we're doing in a program called

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.820 
what we're doing in a program called
Operation<00:01:44.850> hydras<00:01:45.300> is<00:01:45.630> we've<00:01:46.110> bonded<00:01:46.350> water

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:46.830 
Operation hydras is we've bonded water

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:49.460 
Operation hydras is we've bonded water
English<00:01:47.150> so<00:01:48.150> our<00:01:48.360> first<00:01:48.510> project<00:01:48.810> is<00:01:49.200> in<00:01:49.350> the

village and cameras Oquendo we're

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.320 
village and cameras Oquendo we're
building<00:01:52.800> a<00:01:53.040> spring<00:01:53.370> water<00:01:53.580> distribution

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:54.330 
building a spring water distribution

00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:57.950 
building a spring water distribution
system<00:01:54.650> and<00:01:55.650> for<00:01:56.640> every<00:01:57.360> dollar<00:01:57.750> we

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
system and for every dollar we

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.650 
system and for every dollar we
contribute<00:01:58.770> over<00:01:59.040> here<00:01:59.250> for<00:02:00.090> every<00:02:00.330> dollar<00:02:00.510> we

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:00.660 
contribute over here for every dollar we

contribute over here for every dollar we
contribute<00:02:01.230> to<00:02:01.350> that<00:02:01.440> project<00:02:01.710> we're<00:02:02.670> able<00:02:02.850> to

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
contribute to that project we're able to

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.480 
contribute to that project we're able to
generate<00:02:03.510> 2,000<00:02:04.290> gallons<00:02:04.530> of<00:02:04.680> water<00:02:05.100> in<00:02:05.340> that

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
generate 2,000 gallons of water in that

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:07.730 
generate 2,000 gallons of water in that
village<00:02:05.960> it's<00:02:06.960> a<00:02:07.050> really<00:02:07.200> small<00:02:07.350> scale

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
village it's a really small scale

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.160 
village it's a really small scale
project<00:02:08.220> but<00:02:08.520> the<00:02:09.210> goal<00:02:09.479> is<00:02:09.510> to<00:02:09.720> sort<00:02:10.080> of

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:10.170 
project but the goal is to sort of

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.160 
project but the goal is to sort of
replicate<00:02:10.380> the<00:02:10.770> model<00:02:11.100> so<00:02:11.700> first<00:02:12.000> one<00:02:12.270> sky's

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
replicate the model so first one sky's

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:16.320 
replicate the model so first one sky's
the<00:02:13.200> limit<00:02:13.380> three<00:02:13.770> comes<00:02:14.000> tomorrow

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:16.330 
the limit three comes tomorrow

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.210 
the limit three comes tomorrow
I'll<00:02:16.810> tell<00:02:17.020> us<00:02:17.140> about<00:02:17.230> the<00:02:17.500> other<00:02:17.800> filters

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:18.220 
I'll tell us about the other filters

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:19.650 
I'll tell us about the other filters
themselves<00:02:18.730> how<00:02:18.850> often<00:02:19.150> they<00:02:19.300> need<00:02:19.450> to<00:02:19.540> be
