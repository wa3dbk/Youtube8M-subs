00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.140
Hi kids, it’s me Miss Booksy

00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:04.220
and it’s story time here at Cool School!

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:05.480
Hi Eleanor!

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:06.640
Hi Ms. Booksy!

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:08.620
Are you ready for a new story?

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:09.900
KIDS: Oh yeah!!

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.020
Oh my gosh! We’re almost late for Story time!!

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.400
I love Story time.

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.220
Me too! Me too!

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.780
… I hope it’s a Robot story.

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.420
Sh! Sh!

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:23.600
Shhh!!!

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:24.640
Okay, okay!

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.840
Ok, is everyone ready to read “Sleeping Beauty”?

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:32.340
Once upon a time, there was a--

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.500
Um, uh... Sleeping Beauty?

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.660
Miss Booksy? I have a question

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:37.280
Harry has a question.

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.480
Are there any robots in Sleeping Beauty?

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:41.940
Um, no.

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.000
There aren’t any robots in Sleeping Beauty

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.380
I heard, I heard.

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:49.580
It’s ok, I'm sure it's a very nice story anyway. You go ahead--

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:51.840
Of course there are no robots,

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.280
it’s an amazing story about taking a huge nap

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:03.120
and then when you wake up finding true love in spite of an evil witch fairy.

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.180
Really??

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.400
Well, you know that coulda been an evil robot.. but it’s ok. Go ahead Miss Booksy

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:10.060
Go ahead.

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:11.840
Ok, thanks Miles

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.860
Here we go again! “Sleeping Beauty.”

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:16.520
Once upon a time

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.820
a beautiful little baby princess was--

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.280
MILES: Oh oh oh oh oh! Can we be in the story??

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.740
Is there a good part I can play?

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.220
Oh, me too. Me too!

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.100
Well if there are parts being handed out

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:31.640
I know a young thespian who would relish the opportunity to perform.

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:32.460
Relish?

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:33.640
The-bi-something?

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:35.940
Sure guys!

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.960
There are some great parts you could play.

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:40.120
Miles, you could be a fairy!

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.820
Oh well... I dunno..

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.500
How 'bout being the king?

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.120
King? Yeah! Now you're talking!

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:53.680
Since you're the king, can you also be a nice fairy?

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.440
Yeah, ok fine. As long as I'm the king.

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.580
I don’t care what I am…

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:01.860
No, I totally do.

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.920
Can I be the Prince? There's always a prince...

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.420
Well, you're right. There IS a prince,

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:07.400
And you're him!

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.440
Or he's you.

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:09.600
Or... something.

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:10.780
Awesome!!

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.920
And Eleanor.. I’m thinking you can be

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.260
the evil fairy!

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.760
Oh perfect!

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.120
Watch out, guys. He he he he he!

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:23.500
I think you might be too NICE to be an evil fairy!

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.920
Oh, you'll see, you'll see...

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.940
Okay, Sleeping Beauty take 2!

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:37.780
Once upon a time a beautiful little baby princess was born in a magical kingdom.

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.780
The king and queen invited the 7 fairies,

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.520
you know the magic fairies who come to bless little babies.

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.300
Fairies? Is that me??

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.700
Nope, not yet! Just a sec.

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:50.180
Okay...

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:51.980
Miles, it's your turn!!

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:53.940
Oh!! Here I am!

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.980
Whoa, the wings are actually, actually pretty cool...

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.620
BOOKSY: Anywho, so all the fairies were invited...

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.500
Well, all except for one fairy who hadn’t responded to like any invitations recently,

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.820
I mean that fairy never came so why bother to keep inviting her??

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.160
That turned out to be a bad idea.

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.080
Well, the uninvited fairy

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.760
Eleanor, you're the unhappy fairy!

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:18.940
Mwahahahaha!

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.680
So, she found out about the blessing party.

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.120
And got super annoyed that she wan't invited!

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.840
So, she crashed the party.

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.280
Not only did she crash it, she showed up really late,

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.280
right in the middle of the king’s flute solo.

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.100
And, instead of a blessing, she put a curse on the baby!

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.300
Toil n trouble,

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:41.160
my curse upon you shall bubble!

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:44.400
Instead of growing up to be something special,

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.980
and having fame that will linger...

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:51.760
you will touch a spindle and get pricked on the finger!

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:56.080
And then you will sleep for 100 years in a big snoring heap!

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:00.120
And if you're lucky, a prince will wake you and you'll think he's neat!

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:03.060
Oh.... I almost forgot THIS.

00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:06.300
To totally, 100% break the spell,

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:09.180
the prince has to give you...

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:10.900
A kiss!!

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:12.380
Mmmmuah!

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:14.640
Ha ha ha ha ha!

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:18.120
As you can see, it was a pretty evil curse!

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:21.040
The princess would get pricked by a spindle

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:22.020
Ouch!

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:25.480
and sleep for a HUNDRED years,

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:30.560
and after all that time, she could only be awakened by a prince who kisses her?

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:34.940
Oy, a hundred years of sleeping and there’s still a catch!

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:36.440
The king was like:

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:39.120
To avoid that mean fairy curse,

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:42.300
There shall be no spindles allowed in this kingdom!

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:44.440
BOOKSY: So the little princess grew up,

00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:46.220
into meeee!

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:49.720
So, I'm chillin',

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.040
no spindles around,

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:53.000
I wouldn’t even know one if I saw one.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.980
Seriously, like, what's a spindle?

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.040
This turned out to be a problem

00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:02.320
because there was one little old spinster who didn’t get the memo.

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:05.980
I didn't know! Nobody told me!

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:09.280
One day I saw her spinning away,

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:13.340
making the most beautiful thread for the most beautiful gown.

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:14.760
I asked her:

00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:20.460
Hey, could I try your cool... spinning... machine... thing?

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:23.660
and as fate would have it,

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:26.400
I pricked my finger.

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:27.400
Uh-oh!

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:30.280
I think THAT'S  a spindle!

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:36.520
Oh dear! That's not good...

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.020
My parents were devastated.

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:43.120
Rather than have life go on for the 100 years while I was sleeping,

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:48.500
they asked one of the nice fairies to put a sleeping spell on the whole castle,

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:50.440
so we could all wake up together.

00:05:51.220 --> 00:05:52.960
Miles... that's you again!

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:56.900
If a prince doesn't kiss her, we're going to be weepy.

00:05:56.900 --> 00:06:01.020
But for the next 100 years, we're going to be sleepy!

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:04.040
Nighty night!

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:21.160
Hey! Don't touch that dial. Click right here for part 2.
