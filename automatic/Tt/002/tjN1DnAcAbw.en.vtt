00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:12.300
 so the conversation went about whether it was possible 

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:19.500
 to etch the force with nitric acid from 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:21.650
 well or not here look here this 

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:24.720
 crap 

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:33.320
 very, very, very, very 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:39.540
 long even have you break the top 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:47.910
 here it is so much you will have it 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:51.180
 hanging around in my head is a lot considering 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:01:03.059
 what else is there a valve valve and there 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:01:05.359
 there is a hot there is no by it now 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.359
 will find 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.310
 there is a forsa stub 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.500
 very plump 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:27.130
 we put water over it here 

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:39.400
 diluted with nitric acid and try and 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:43.220
 let's see what we get from this 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:45.560
 Today is tomorrow tomorrow 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.340
 come here let's see what we have for 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.260
 day will be 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:50.260
 and the power of it 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:02:02.270
 in general , we put in a jar 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:13.500
 the truth came out with us somewhere around 

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:17.450
 30 milligrams of water 15 milligrams 

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:17.450
 and sounds 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:25.010
 the bubbles went stink too 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:37.070
 ok now a little bit of acid 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:41.210
 add and everything and see how this 

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:44.530
 slice we have it about 

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:44.530
 us centimeter 2 

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:57.110
 three days have passed we will teach nothing short 

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:57.110
 not changed 

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:07.380
 how sat it a force return line ate 

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:21.130
 this is our lowest part 

00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:25.220
 but no nut for three days no sense 

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:33.920
 so let's try this here 

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:42.550
 here is garbage throw in acid and we will 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:42.550
 look at this at the same time what and how much 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:52.700
 I can not even imagine how much it is necessary and 

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:57.860
 to eliminate the force if it is on these 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:04:03.069
 find the track and start on a micron to you 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:03.069
 drip onto the cylinder 

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:11.890
 joy you will have full pants not 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:11.890
 wake famously while it is quiet 

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:21.639
 noodle bolt figuratively speaking two or three 

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:21.639
 days and it all dissolves 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:36.310
 there is a bolt now Iâ€™ll still bolt there 

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:38.930
 Now I measure its length and let down 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:43.879
 put it risers and see how much 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:48.969
 he will eat him football 

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:53.740
 he is not visible I will tell you 75 millimeters 

00:04:48.969 --> 00:04:57.580
 so I get tired put to where the thread 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:05:00.650
 that's it and it was dissolved and 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:04.400
 let's see will be another day tomorrow 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:05.169
 I will come and see how he became 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.800
 less 

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:08.800
 how ate it 

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:16.910
 Here are the stand 

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:29.910
 noise stink. 

00:05:32.100 --> 00:05:35.210
 and see 

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:41.060
 Well, we get out of it 

00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:53.390
 devour will not devour 

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:59.750
 we remove 

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:06.390
 waiting for more 

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:37.880
 in general, two weeks flew by 

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:50.290
 the bolt must have dropped the net 

00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:53.330
 looked all the other parts and veterans 

00:06:50.290 --> 00:06:57.800
 most likely it is nitrogen to it should 

00:06:53.330 --> 00:07:00.680
 work hot on a hungry she 

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:05.270
 practically does not work duck and you are 

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:07.360
 Th deposits that is shorter not always 

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:11.710
 she did not take 

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:11.710
 although the day is more than water 

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:19.280
 so forget about it as scary 

00:07:14.789 --> 00:07:22.680
 sleep well bolt a centimeter maybe 

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:28.320
 eaten on hot can be eaten and 

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:30.630
 more plan all crap no complete engine 

00:07:28.320 --> 00:07:35.430
 yes hot i think the reaction was 

00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:37.130
 faster well how do we hot etch 

00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:40.830
 nozzle 

00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:43.220
 I will not go crazy and I don't even want my head 

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:43.220
 to hammer
