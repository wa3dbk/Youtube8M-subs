about I don't know seven hundred eight
hundred<00:00:11.519> gallons<00:00:12.090> and<00:00:12.389> I'm<00:00:12.929> filling<00:00:13.290> the<00:00:13.349> back

and the reason I did that because in the

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:18.200 
and the reason I did that because in the
winter<00:00:16.830> time<00:00:16.949> before<00:00:17.250> the<00:00:17.340> snow<00:00:17.699> comes<00:00:18.000> and

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:18.210 
winter time before the snow comes and

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.460 
winter time before the snow comes and
put<00:00:18.330> ice<00:00:18.510> comes<00:00:18.900> you<00:00:18.960> got<00:00:19.080> to<00:00:19.199> do<00:00:19.260> a<00:00:19.289> water

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
put ice comes you got to do a water

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:20.960 
put ice comes you got to do a water
change<00:00:19.619> it's<00:00:20.070> just<00:00:20.130> like<00:00:20.369> doing<00:00:20.550> a<00:00:20.640> big<00:00:20.789> water

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
change it's just like doing a big water

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.359 
change it's just like doing a big water
change<00:00:21.240> for<00:00:21.390> your<00:00:21.510> fish<00:00:21.990> tank<00:00:22.170> you<00:00:22.949> gotta<00:00:23.189> get

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
rid of those excess nitrates and

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.420 
rid of those excess nitrates and
phosphates<00:00:25.289> and<00:00:25.410> all<00:00:25.470> my<00:00:25.590> plants<00:00:25.980> died<00:00:26.160> back

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
phosphates and all my plants died back

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.370 
phosphates and all my plants died back
on<00:00:26.640> 100<00:00:27.029> percent<00:00:27.119> sure<00:00:27.570> that<00:00:27.720> the<00:00:27.810> nitrates

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:28.380 
on 100 percent sure that the nitrates

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:30.950 
on 100 percent sure that the nitrates
and<00:00:28.500> stuff<00:00:28.740> has<00:00:28.920> skyrocketed<00:00:29.310> up<00:00:29.840> but<00:00:30.840> it's

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
and stuff has skyrocketed up but it's

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.179 
and stuff has skyrocketed up but it's
not<00:00:31.019> as<00:00:31.230> much<00:00:31.380> as<00:00:31.500> you<00:00:31.560> think<00:00:31.710> because<00:00:32.009> in<00:00:32.099> the

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
not as much as you think because in the

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.880 
not as much as you think because in the
wintertime<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:32.700> metabolism<00:00:33.120> slows<00:00:33.510> down

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:33.890 
wintertime the metabolism slows down

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.549

it gets to 45 degrees stop feeding a

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
period because simply they cannot digest

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.389 
period because simply they cannot digest
it<00:00:45.780> you've<00:00:46.590> had<00:00:46.710> to<00:00:46.829> stop<00:00:47.010> feeding<00:00:47.190> them<00:00:47.340> a

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
it you've had to stop feeding them a

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.090 
it you've had to stop feeding them a
high-protein<00:00:47.820> diet<00:00:47.969> in<00:00:48.660> the<00:00:49.200> fall<00:00:49.410> and<00:00:49.890> early

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
high-protein diet in the fall and early

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.100 
high-protein diet in the fall and early
spring<00:00:50.399> in<00:00:50.760> through<00:00:51.000> winter<00:00:51.180> because<00:00:51.840> they

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:52.110 
spring in through winter because they

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:53.959 
spring in through winter because they
cannot<00:00:52.350> digest<00:00:52.590> that<00:00:53.010> protein<00:00:53.430> here<00:00:53.640> we<00:00:53.760> just

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
cannot digest that protein here we just

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.580 
cannot digest that protein here we just
sit<00:00:54.149> in<00:00:54.270> there<00:00:54.420> organ<00:00:54.809> so<00:00:55.110> it's<00:00:55.260> kind<00:00:55.530> of

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:55.590 
sit in there organ so it's kind of

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:57.020 
sit in there organ so it's kind of
similar<00:00:55.800> to<00:00:55.949> a<00:00:56.039> stomach<00:00:56.489> but<00:00:56.699> it's<00:00:56.879> not

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
similar to a stomach but it's not

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.029 
similar to a stomach but it's not
exactly<00:00:57.329> a<00:00:57.420> stomach<00:00:57.809> if<00:00:58.500> we<00:00:58.559> just<00:00:58.710> sit<00:00:58.890> there

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
exactly a stomach if we just sit there

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.459 
exactly a stomach if we just sit there
watch<00:00:59.340> so<00:00:59.910> if<00:01:00.780> you<00:01:00.899> feed<00:01:01.140> them<00:01:01.260> put

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
watch so if you feed them put

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.969 
watch so if you feed them put
high-protein<00:01:01.920> diets<00:01:02.699> in<00:01:02.850> a<00:01:03.379> 55<00:01:04.379> degree<00:01:04.409> below

just kill your face period so block the

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.520 
just kill your face period so block the
street<00:01:15.479> and<00:01:15.600> their<00:01:15.689> countless<00:01:15.930> camera-shy

cleaning up some crabs the net over

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.070 
cleaning up some crabs the net over
there<00:01:19.439> but<00:01:20.270> giving<00:01:21.270> this<00:01:21.420> thing<00:01:21.600> ready<00:01:21.750> for

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
there but giving this thing ready for

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.810 
there but giving this thing ready for
the<00:01:22.140> spring<00:01:22.710> and<00:01:22.979> I<00:01:23.100> cannot<00:01:23.369> wait<00:01:23.790> until

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
the spring and I cannot wait until

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.090 
the spring and I cannot wait until
springtime<00:01:24.390> comes<00:01:24.840> gonna<00:01:25.409> fix<00:01:25.650> this<00:01:25.770> thing<00:01:25.950> up

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
springtime comes gonna fix this thing up

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.710 
springtime comes gonna fix this thing up
really<00:01:26.520> good<00:01:26.670> first<00:01:27.299> thing<00:01:27.420> I'm<00:01:27.509> gonna<00:01:27.600> do

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:27.720 
really good first thing I'm gonna do

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.359 
really good first thing I'm gonna do
probably<00:01:27.900> is<00:01:28.110> get<00:01:28.229> a<00:01:28.259> UV<00:01:28.560> sterilizer<00:01:28.619> on<00:01:29.250> this

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
probably is get a UV sterilizer on this

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:32.600 
probably is get a UV sterilizer on this
