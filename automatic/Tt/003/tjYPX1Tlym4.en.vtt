00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.240
 image 

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:18.180
 all from death throw devoted development 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:21.890
 hypertrophy a little bit let's go go addition 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:24.849
 what is fiber care 

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:27.560
 body and trophy maybe i'm in vain on 

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:31.120
 tab for fast-shrinking fibers 

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:33.030
 and for slow muscle fibers 

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:35.280
 and also it opens two types 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.810
 sarcoplasmic and cute fibrillary 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.610
 In this case, I grew up with you they 

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:41.500
 are popular 

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.770
 hypertrophy for quickly shrinking everything 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:46.350
 slowly cutting powerful and gender 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:49.690
 let's start today thursday 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:52.300
 I will train for hypertrophy fast 

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:54.040
 cutting fibers powerful and parameters 

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:58.540
 loads for this not on pursuing 

00:00:54.040 --> 00:01:02.680
 mean rest interval from 37 to 1 

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:05.560
 seconds I will probably choose 6090 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:08.860
 for yourself for your workout amount 

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:11.250
 working approaches from 3 to 6 

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:16.090
 Well, on this film I will do three approaches 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:23.860
 3-4 exercises per workout 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:26.440
 and that even forgot to weight complication in 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:30.720
 80 range 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:33.130
 8-10 reps and the most important point 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.290
 Everything I listed is very similar to 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.480
 ordinary strength training in what 

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:43.360
 the difference is that we have dosed 

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:45.190
 rest interval 60-90 seconds if 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.800
 not enough time to cope with 

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:49.210
 the weight that you set for yourself 

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.850
 it means you need to reduce the weight but still 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:55.840
 to withstand the rigorous failure of the spirit in this 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:58.390
 range and spacing 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:01.929
 work already exercises himself he looks 

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:04.240
 like a new type of training ie 1 

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:06.250
 second start one second rise but 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.830
 without bristle that is without repulsed without 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:12.840
 swinging and that kind of say so 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.840
 relief exercises will begin 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.560
 Unlike 

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.900
 strength training types here i 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:52.230
 I use a little less weight 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:55.410
 because you need to do this more 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:56.220
 qualitatively because you need to approach 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.800
 next approach 

00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:02.120
 that moment when you are still not completely 

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:04.070
 recovered that is some nippon and 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.810
 recovery between approaches is 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:09.480
 basic principle mechanism 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:12.060
 muscle development and hypertrophy it should 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:14.250
 began to accumulate 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.430
 should in theory even be reduced 

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.190
 a little bit 

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:21.340
 but 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:24.220
 and a very important motivator is the clock by 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:28.690
 shows upstairs 

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:29.819
 let's do a lot of things though so much 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:31.650
 how much are you filled 

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:34.810
 nothing more you nothing 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:37.950
 distracted start paul c 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:40.830
 not assigned to get the desired effect 

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:42.930
 All training period amounts are not judged. 

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:46.580
 worlds for a period 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.580
 aimed at the whale size 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.920
 Well 

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:54.230
 you need to build do the same 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.230
 brass tempo signal time to work 

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:02.950
 here 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.910
 done so less but within 

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:29.910
 permissible 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:29.910
 red 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.080
 promised 

00:04:55.890 --> 00:05:04.870
 water approach with 40 kilograms first but 

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:07.710
 It is because of this that I feel that 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:10.570
 must feel tired 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:12.460
 management satisfaction and one 

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:18.700
 exercises on a powerful group in this 

00:05:12.460 --> 00:05:20.410
 you want speech is not enough but in like 

00:05:18.700 --> 00:05:21.280
 the same pace of the exercise I will 

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:28.600
 do more today 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:30.000
 back biceps hips and arms but desirable 

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:34.180
 See no point because everyone 

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:36.670
 monotonous and boring tomorrow I'll show you 

00:05:34.180 --> 00:05:39.010
 what is the difference between hypertrophy on slow 

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:41.740
 cutting fibers and you will see what 

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:44.560
 the principle of using hadith there will be 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:45.580
 and how to set the pace correctly 

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:49.439
 run way me 

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:49.439
 for this forget
