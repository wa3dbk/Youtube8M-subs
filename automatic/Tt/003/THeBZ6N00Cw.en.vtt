why<00:05:17.930> do<00:05:17.990> we<00:05:18.139> do<00:05:18.259> it<00:05:18.289> this<00:05:18.440> way<00:05:18.590> because<00:05:19.130> the

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:19.400 
why do we do it this way because the

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:21.100 
why do we do it this way because the
number<00:05:19.849> one<00:05:20.000> factor<00:05:20.210> for<00:05:20.479> muscular<00:05:20.750> growth<00:05:20.870> is

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:21.110 
number one factor for muscular growth is

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:24.430 
number one factor for muscular growth is
not<00:05:21.530> buying<00:05:22.069> it<00:05:22.220> is<00:05:22.370> frequency<00:05:22.940> so<00:05:23.870> we're

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:24.440 
not buying it is frequency so we're

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:25.839 
not buying it is frequency so we're
doing<00:05:24.590> the<00:05:24.740> workouts<00:05:25.039> this<00:05:25.099> way<00:05:25.250> allows<00:05:25.460> us<00:05:25.759> to

00:05:25.839 --> 00:05:25.849 
doing the workouts this way allows us to

00:05:25.849 --> 00:05:27.520 
doing the workouts this way allows us to
have<00:05:26.030> a<00:05:26.060> good<00:05:26.240> amount<00:05:26.389> of<00:05:26.479> intensity<00:05:26.870> but<00:05:27.409> we

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:27.530 
have a good amount of intensity but we

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:29.140 
have a good amount of intensity but we
can<00:05:27.650> also<00:05:27.770> get<00:05:28.009> the<00:05:28.099> volume<00:05:28.280> maybe<00:05:28.940> you're

00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:29.150 
can also get the volume maybe you're

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:30.520 
can also get the volume maybe you're
only<00:05:29.270> doing<00:05:29.419> one<00:05:29.690> chest<00:05:29.960> one<00:05:30.139> back<00:05:30.320> when
