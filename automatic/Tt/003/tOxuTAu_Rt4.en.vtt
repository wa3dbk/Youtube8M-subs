00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:24.500
 plan types 

00:00:19.919 --> 00:00:26.869
 part of which attention 

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:29.840
 All video examples in this tutorial will be 

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:32.390
 show up without sound because 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:37.640
 way the visual material is digested 

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:42.650
 much better title plans for moving 

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:45.320
 camera shooting moving camera attached 

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:47.090
 the plan is more expressive but very 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.830
 it is important to understand when it is necessary 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:51.260
 use camera in motion 

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:53.780
 and when it is better to put a static plan 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:56.210
 when the camera moves with it 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:59.149
 move and the viewer attaches to the plan 

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:04.629
 more speakers are very necessary scene 

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:04.629
 its color panorama 

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:11.240
 human head can turn 

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:13.310
 from left to right or top to bottom exactly 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:16.000
 so the panorama looks like this 

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:16.000
 naturally 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:20.580
 and 

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:42.380
 took a cart ride 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:45.479
 starting in one physical place and 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:48.329
 friend- terminated data frames 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:49.259
 used to show movement in 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:51.600
 such a cut 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:54.770
 in which but cannot be shown by 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.770
 static camera 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.420
 how is the driveway removed from the cart 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:33.860
 hitting a cart 

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:51.320
 how to shoot on 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:51.320
 there are carts 

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:10.099
 departure in the trolley 

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:27.799
 tracking plan the camera is in 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:31.569
 synchronous 

00:03:27.799 --> 00:03:34.390
 movement with the object of shooting e.g. 

00:03:31.569 --> 00:03:36.650
 take a look at how the camera moves 

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:41.500
 directly behind the main character and 

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:41.500
 all the actions that he performs 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:56.420
 shooting 

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:57.440
 the crane can move freely in all 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:00.080
 three planes 

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:02.990
 this creates the impression 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:06.440
 like the viewer is flying emotional 

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:08.920
 the effect of swooping tap shooting is just 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.920
 out of competition 

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:33.940
 how to shoot from a crane 

00:05:07.790 --> 00:05:13.230
 This kind of shooting can be like 

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:14.580
 ordinary and give some video 

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:18.750
 realistic action 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:20.640
 let's look at an example practically 

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:24.870
 all films of this director 

00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:28.280
 filming term light stirring 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:31.530
 when shooting gives viewers a sense of being 

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:35.190
 as if they themselves are looking into the castle 

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:39.740
 well may pry but not be 

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:44.240
 participants of events this is the effect 

00:05:39.740 --> 00:05:44.240
 realistic when shooting with hands 

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:58.730
 lived plan 

00:05:55.720 --> 00:06:01.400
 zoom is the ability to change focal 

00:05:58.730 --> 00:06:02.180
 lens distance throughout 

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:04.520
 single frame 

00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:06.920
 in order to present the subjects of this shooting 

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:09.620
 more or less large frames 

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:12.740
 this plan has something to do with arrivals 

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:16.660
 and leaving the trolley but the camera 

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:18.680
 static during this type of survey 

00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:21.740
 modern cinema 

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:24.230
 the zoom plan is used extremely rarely he 

00:06:21.740 --> 00:06:25.700
 was widely used by the sixties and 

00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:29.350
 seventies 

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:29.350
 for example bluesoleil films 

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:42.589
 modern cinema is either short 

00:06:39.900 --> 00:06:42.589
 moment of change 

00:06:42.770 --> 00:06:50.159
 notice how smoothly the frames are added up 

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:53.249
 it is almost not noticeable by the way it 

00:06:50.159 --> 00:07:01.620
 the only scene in the whole movie where 

00:06:53.249 --> 00:07:04.650
 There is a zoom plan or a movie chip 

00:07:01.620 --> 00:07:07.469
 like for example the trilogy of the friends of the ocean 

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:10.139
 the film is filled with zoom plans but he and 

00:07:07.469 --> 00:07:20.520
 stylized film of the sixties 

00:07:10.139 --> 00:07:23.689
 seventies sequel you'll see 

00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:23.689
 next issue
