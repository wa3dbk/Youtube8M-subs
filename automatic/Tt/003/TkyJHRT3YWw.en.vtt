here pull it up you might need to really
get<00:01:51.820> a<00:01:51.880> little<00:01:52.179> firmness<00:01:53.340> there<00:01:54.340> we<00:01:54.429> go<00:01:55.289> we

00:01:56.279 --> 00:01:56.289 
get a little firmness there we go we

00:01:56.289 --> 00:02:01.050 
get a little firmness there we go we
broke<00:01:56.560> it<00:01:56.710> loose<00:01:56.860> and<00:01:57.390> all<00:01:58.390> she<00:01:58.600> comes<00:01:59.909> this<00:02:00.909> is

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
broke it loose and all she comes this is

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.980 
broke it loose and all she comes this is
your<00:02:01.500> eight<00:02:02.500> millimeter<00:02:02.950> allen<00:02:03.689> bolt<00:02:04.689> out<00:02:04.929> of

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 
your eight millimeter allen bolt out of

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:11.430 
your eight millimeter allen bolt out of
there<00:02:05.579> alone<00:02:07.769> ok<00:02:08.769> now<00:02:09.539> the<00:02:10.539> crank<00:02:10.810> still<00:02:11.170> will

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
there alone ok now the crank still will

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:12.839 
there alone ok now the crank still will
not<00:02:11.530> just<00:02:11.799> come<00:02:11.860> right<00:02:12.190> off<00:02:12.250> because<00:02:12.700> it's

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:12.849 
not just come right off because it's

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:18.199 
not just come right off because it's
pressed<00:02:13.269> on<00:02:13.510> so<00:02:14.230> we<00:02:14.349> need<00:02:14.530> to<00:02:14.650> use<00:02:14.860> this<00:02:15.130> polar

00:02:18.199 --> 00:02:18.209 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:21.000 

first<00:02:19.209> we<00:02:19.540> have<00:02:19.630> to<00:02:19.690> thread<00:02:20.079> the<00:02:20.260> big<00:02:20.470> part<00:02:20.799> in

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
first we have to thread the big part in

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:22.650 
first we have to thread the big part in
again<00:02:21.489> we're<00:02:21.640> going<00:02:21.760> to<00:02:21.849> use<00:02:22.000> that<00:02:22.030> 12<00:02:22.480> inch

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:22.660 
again we're going to use that 12 inch

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:24.930 
again we're going to use that 12 inch
adjustable<00:02:22.780> wrench<00:02:23.470> we<00:02:24.250> can<00:02:24.400> take<00:02:24.549> this<00:02:24.700> part

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:24.940 
adjustable wrench we can take this part

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:27.120 
adjustable wrench we can take this part
all<00:02:25.120> the<00:02:25.269> way<00:02:25.390> out<00:02:25.420> if<00:02:25.750> we<00:02:25.900> want<00:02:26.110> and<00:02:26.319> just<00:02:26.349> read

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:27.130 
all the way out if we want and just read

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:30.150 
all the way out if we want and just read
this<00:02:27.280> part<00:02:27.549> in<00:02:28.319> get<00:02:29.319> it<00:02:29.470> in<00:02:29.590> there<00:02:29.620> straight

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.160 
this part in get it in there straight

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.120 
this part in get it in there straight
start<00:02:31.120> it<00:02:31.269> by<00:02:31.450> hand<00:02:31.870> if<00:02:32.260> it<00:02:32.680> gets<00:02:32.829> a<00:02:32.980> little

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
start it by hand if it gets a little

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:35.580 
start it by hand if it gets a little
tough<00:02:33.459> make<00:02:33.760> sure<00:02:34.120> you<00:02:34.450> get<00:02:34.750> it<00:02:34.959> in<00:02:35.230> all<00:02:35.530> the

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:35.590 
tough make sure you get it in all the

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:45.240 
tough make sure you get it in all the
way<00:02:42.540> this<00:02:43.540> is<00:02:43.599> an<00:02:43.930> important<00:02:44.470> step<00:02:44.769> if<00:02:45.100> you

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
way this is an important step if you

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:46.830 
way this is an important step if you
don't<00:02:45.430> get<00:02:45.639> this<00:02:45.790> baby<00:02:46.090> in<00:02:46.329> all<00:02:46.480> the<00:02:46.630> way<00:02:46.780> you

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
don't get this baby in all the way you

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.960 
don't get this baby in all the way you
could<00:02:47.260> pull<00:02:47.590> the<00:02:47.739> aluminum<00:02:48.310> right<00:02:48.519> off<00:02:48.730> for

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:48.970 
could pull the aluminum right off for

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:50.970 
could pull the aluminum right off for
the<00:02:49.060> aluminum<00:02:49.989> threads<00:02:50.290> right<00:02:50.500> out<00:02:50.709> of<00:02:50.739> the

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:50.980 
the aluminum threads right out of the

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.670 
the aluminum threads right out of the
socket<00:02:51.220> here<00:02:51.639> and<00:02:51.989> then<00:02:52.989> you<00:02:53.139> will<00:02:53.319> end<00:02:53.560> up

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:53.680 
socket here and then you will end up

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.530 
socket here and then you will end up
beating<00:02:53.980> and<00:02:54.250> living<00:02:54.579> date<00:02:54.850> that's<00:02:55.329> out<00:02:55.510> of

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:55.540 
beating and living date that's out of

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:57.180 
beating and living date that's out of
this<00:02:55.690> thing<00:02:55.870> to<00:02:56.019> try<00:02:56.230> to<00:02:56.290> get<00:02:56.530> it<00:02:56.680> off<00:02:56.859> it's

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
this thing to try to get it off it's

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.099 
this thing to try to get it off it's
almost<00:02:57.519> impossible<00:02:57.940> to<00:02:58.420> get<00:02:58.569> it<00:02:58.660> off<00:02:58.780> without

00:02:59.099 --> 00:02:59.109 
almost impossible to get it off without

00:02:59.109 --> 00:03:02.940 
almost impossible to get it off without
a<00:02:59.560> polar<00:02:59.829> all<00:03:00.579> right<00:03:00.730> back<00:03:01.480> again<00:03:01.810> I've<00:03:02.739> got

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:02.950 
a polar all right back again I've got

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.190 
a polar all right back again I've got
that<00:03:03.100> part<00:03:03.340> all<00:03:03.549> the<00:03:03.730> way<00:03:03.880> in<00:03:03.910> now<00:03:04.600> we're<00:03:05.079> going

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.200 
that part all the way in now we're going

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.390 
that part all the way in now we're going
to<00:03:05.260> screw<00:03:06.900> that<00:03:07.900> volt<00:03:08.290> part<00:03:08.590> the<00:03:08.769> other<00:03:08.799> end<00:03:09.250> of

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
to screw that volt part the other end of

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.910 
to screw that volt part the other end of
the<00:03:09.489> eight<00:03:09.639> millimeter<00:03:10.120> right<00:03:10.389> in<00:03:10.569> and<00:03:10.920> she's
