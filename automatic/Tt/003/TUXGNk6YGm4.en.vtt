and<00:03:02.629> it<00:03:03.049> comes<00:03:03.379> and<00:03:03.890> so<00:03:04.459> I<00:03:04.670> thought<00:03:05.180> I'd<00:03:05.450> and

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:05.890 
and it comes and so I thought I'd and

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:09.039 
and it comes and so I thought I'd and
developed<00:03:06.890> over<00:03:07.280> many<00:03:07.459> years<00:03:07.610> a<00:03:08.299> lovely

00:03:09.039 --> 00:03:09.049 
developed over many years a lovely

00:03:09.049 --> 00:03:12.880 
developed over many years a lovely
tamping<00:03:09.920> and<00:03:11.079> routine<00:03:12.079> and<00:03:12.349> it<00:03:12.440> used<00:03:12.590> to<00:03:12.709> take

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 
tamping and routine and it used to take

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:15.490 
tamping and routine and it used to take
me<00:03:12.950> longer<00:03:13.420> anyway<00:03:14.420> the<00:03:14.480> customer<00:03:15.140> can<00:03:15.170> wait

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
me longer anyway the customer can wait

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.750 
me longer anyway the customer can wait
because<00:03:16.340> I<00:03:16.819> can<00:03:17.569> you<00:03:17.660> sell<00:03:17.959> bail<00:03:18.290> then<00:03:19.250> and

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
because I can you sell bail then and

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:23.500 
because I can you sell bail then and
then<00:03:20.000> we<00:03:20.299> got<00:03:21.260> one<00:03:21.440> of<00:03:21.530> these<00:03:21.709> I<00:03:22.390> wasn't<00:03:23.390> doing

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:23.510 
then we got one of these I wasn't doing

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:28.780 
then we got one of these I wasn't doing
well<00:03:23.810> at<00:03:23.959> all<00:03:26.799> the<00:03:27.799> two<00:03:28.040> years<00:03:28.340> of<00:03:28.549> learning

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:28.790 
well at all the two years of learning

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.890 
well at all the two years of learning
how<00:03:29.299> to<00:03:29.359> do<00:03:29.720> this<00:03:30.079> and<00:03:30.670> and<00:03:31.670> now<00:03:31.970> I'd<00:03:32.359> come<00:03:32.659> back

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
how to do this and and now I'd come back

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:37.660 
how to do this and and now I'd come back
and<00:03:33.290> it's<00:03:33.530> really<00:03:33.890> simple<00:03:34.629> just<00:03:36.310> as<00:03:37.310> long<00:03:37.519> as

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:37.670 
and it's really simple just as long as

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:40.960 
and it's really simple just as long as
its<00:03:37.849> level<00:03:38.440> when<00:03:39.440> I<00:03:39.530> when<00:03:39.829> I<00:03:39.859> do<00:03:39.950> it<00:03:40.280> I<00:03:40.459> am<00:03:40.700> I

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:40.970 
its level when I when I do it I am I

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:44.770 
its level when I when I do it I am I
hold<00:03:41.450> it<00:03:41.569> like<00:03:41.720> a<00:03:41.750> torch<00:03:43.030> with<00:03:44.030> my<00:03:44.180> finger<00:03:44.659> and

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:44.780 
hold it like a torch with my finger and

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.870 
hold it like a torch with my finger and
my<00:03:44.930> thumb<00:03:45.730> so<00:03:46.730> when<00:03:46.879> I<00:03:46.970> press<00:03:47.239> down<00:03:47.569> I<00:03:47.900> can<00:03:48.590> feel

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:48.880 
my thumb so when I press down I can feel

00:03:48.880 --> 00:04:07.650 
my thumb so when I press down I can feel
if<00:03:49.880> if<00:03:50.480> it's<00:03:50.720> level<00:03:55.959> okay

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:07.660 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:11.140 

in<00:04:08.660> and<00:04:08.930> I<00:04:09.110> leave<00:04:09.320> it<00:04:09.440> and<00:04:10.370> it<00:04:10.490> helps<00:04:10.790> me<00:04:10.880> level

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:11.150 
in and I leave it and it helps me level

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:15.520 
in and I leave it and it helps me level
map<00:04:11.300> if<00:04:11.450> it's<00:04:11.630> not<00:04:12.050> level<00:04:13.090> like<00:04:14.090> that<00:04:14.500> when<00:04:15.500> I

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:15.530 
map if it's not level like that when I

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:18.789 
map if it's not level like that when I
twist<00:04:16.040> round<00:04:16.489> I<00:04:16.850> can<00:04:17.120> feel<00:04:17.440> that<00:04:18.440> it's<00:04:18.500> not

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:18.799 
twist round I can feel that it's not

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:31.390 
twist round I can feel that it's not
level<00:04:26.080> yeah<00:04:27.080> when<00:04:27.290> it<00:04:28.660> and<00:04:29.660> if<00:04:29.990> you<00:04:30.170> do<00:04:30.410> this<00:04:30.650> if

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400 
level yeah when it and if you do this if

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.000 
level yeah when it and if you do this if
it's<00:04:31.640> an<00:04:31.870> analog<00:04:32.870> the<00:04:33.410> water<00:04:33.620> goes<00:04:33.980> through

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.010 
it's an analog the water goes through

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:36.430 
it's an analog the water goes through
here<00:04:34.430> very<00:04:34.670> quickly<00:04:34.850> and<00:04:35.840> it<00:04:35.990> goes<00:04:36.170> through

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:36.440 
here very quickly and it goes through

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:40.020 
here very quickly and it goes through
here<00:04:36.680> at<00:04:36.950> a<00:04:37.010> different<00:04:37.520> speed<00:04:37.750> so<00:04:38.750> the<00:04:38.780> flavor

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.030 
here at a different speed so the flavor

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:43.930 
here at a different speed so the flavor
will<00:04:41.030> not<00:04:41.210> be<00:04:41.300> even<00:04:41.690> maybe<00:04:42.650> maybe<00:04:43.520> under

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:43.940 
will not be even maybe maybe under

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:47.800 
will not be even maybe maybe under
extractive<00:04:44.510> may<00:04:44.810> be<00:04:44.870> extracted
