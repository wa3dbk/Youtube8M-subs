but<00:03:06.060> okay<00:03:06.720> now<00:03:07.470> there's<00:03:08.280> something<00:03:08.459> important

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:09.560 
but okay now there's something important

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:12.860 
but okay now there's something important
you<00:03:10.560> can<00:03:10.829> get<00:03:11.100> killed<00:03:11.549> which<00:03:12.000> will<00:03:12.299> reduce

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:12.870 
you can get killed which will reduce

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:16.870 
you can get killed which will reduce
your<00:03:13.170> money<00:03:13.380> making<00:03:13.739> per<00:03:13.890> hour<00:03:14.040> obviously<00:03:14.760> and

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:16.880 
your money making per hour obviously and

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.789 
your money making per hour obviously and
from<00:03:17.880> sometimes<00:03:18.480> mining<00:03:19.049> takes<00:03:19.319> really<00:03:19.500> quick

00:03:19.789 --> 00:03:19.799 
from sometimes mining takes really quick

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:21.620 
from sometimes mining takes really quick
like<00:03:20.010> that<00:03:20.190> time<00:03:20.400> it<00:03:20.549> took<00:03:20.670> pretty<00:03:20.940> quick<00:03:21.180> and

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:21.630 
like that time it took pretty quick and

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.809 
like that time it took pretty quick and
I<00:03:21.959> don't<00:03:22.049> know<00:03:22.290> how<00:03:22.440> fast<00:03:23.220> this<00:03:23.430> will<00:03:23.639> take

00:03:23.809 --> 00:03:23.819 
I don't know how fast this will take

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:25.910 
I don't know how fast this will take
it's<00:03:24.090> random<00:03:24.420> and<00:03:24.690> make<00:03:25.139> sure<00:03:25.350> you<00:03:25.500> bring<00:03:25.709> food

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
even though with the stupid evolution of

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.670 
even though with the stupid evolution of
combat<00:03:29.609> Rangers<00:03:30.450> are<00:03:30.599> so<00:03:30.780> overpowered<00:03:31.500> and

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
combat Rangers are so overpowered and

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.230 
combat Rangers are so overpowered and
they'll<00:03:31.890> just<00:03:31.920> freeze<00:03:32.340> you<00:03:32.519> even<00:03:32.819> if<00:03:32.909> you<00:03:33.000> do

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:33.240

you<00:04:09.900> can<00:04:10.110> make<00:04:10.650> better<00:04:10.890> money<00:04:11.100> killing<00:04:11.730> the

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:11.790 
you can make better money killing the

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:13.760 
you can make better money killing the
people<00:04:11.970> who<00:04:12.180> are<00:04:12.270> minding<00:04:12.630> it<00:04:12.780> but<00:04:13.440> at<00:04:13.560> all<00:04:13.680> the

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:13.770 
people who are minding it but at all the

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:19.490 
people who are minding it but at all the
patterns<00:04:14.480> now<00:04:16.100> I'm<00:04:17.100> pretty<00:04:17.640> sure<00:04:18.000> I<00:04:18.500> didn't

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
patterns now I'm pretty sure I didn't

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.190 
patterns now I'm pretty sure I didn't
actually<00:04:19.620> get<00:04:19.920> to<00:04:20.510> mine<00:04:21.510> for<00:04:21.810> a<00:04:21.840> full<00:04:22.020> hour

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:22.200 
actually get to mine for a full hour

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.440 
actually get to mine for a full hour
each<00:04:22.440> time<00:04:22.470> my<00:04:22.860> cup<00:04:23.070> dying<00:04:23.340> but<00:04:23.880> the<00:04:24.030> time<00:04:24.240> it

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:24.450 
each time my cup dying but the time it

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:25.790 
each time my cup dying but the time it
took<00:04:24.570> me<00:04:24.630> to<00:04:24.750> mine<00:04:24.990> around<00:04:25.260> a<00:04:25.410> full<00:04:25.590> inventory

00:04:25.790 --> 00:04:25.800 
took me to mine around a full inventory

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.080 
took me to mine around a full inventory
I<00:04:26.280> calculated<00:04:26.970> it<00:04:27.150> and<00:04:27.780> you<00:04:27.900> could<00:04:28.050> probably

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.090 
I calculated it and you could probably

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:32.660 
I calculated it and you could probably
gain<00:04:30.090> about<00:04:30.840> 400<00:04:31.320> K<00:04:31.470> or<00:04:31.530> more<00:04:31.800> per<00:04:32.040> hour<00:04:32.130> like<00:04:32.520> I

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:32.670 
gain about 400 K or more per hour like I

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:38.930 
gain about 400 K or more per hour like I
said<00:04:32.940> depends<00:04:33.870> on<00:04:33.930> your<00:04:34.080> luck<00:04:34.290> so<00:04:35.960> yeah<00:04:37.940> that's
