00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:11.850 

these<00:00:10.330> kind<00:00:10.629> of<00:00:10.690> virtual<00:00:10.900> objects<00:00:11.620> so<00:00:11.709> if<00:00:11.799> I

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:11.860 
these kind of virtual objects so if I

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:13.440 
these kind of virtual objects so if I
don't<00:00:12.039> have<00:00:12.160> a<00:00:12.190> real<00:00:12.400> train<00:00:12.759> station<00:00:13.209> I<00:00:13.299> can

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:13.450 
don't have a real train station I can

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:15.119 
don't have a real train station I can
just<00:00:13.570> download<00:00:13.719> a<00:00:14.019> virtual<00:00:14.440> one<00:00:14.619> drop<00:00:14.980> it

00:00:15.119 --> 00:00:15.129 
just download a virtual one drop it

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:17.310 
just download a virtual one drop it
wherever<00:00:15.309> I<00:00:15.459> want<00:00:15.759> and<00:00:16.420> we<00:00:16.570> can<00:00:16.689> still<00:00:16.960> detect

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:17.320 
wherever I want and we can still detect

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.140 
wherever I want and we can still detect
when<00:00:17.680> the<00:00:17.829> Train<00:00:18.130> is<00:00:18.160> close<00:00:18.610> to<00:00:18.820> the<00:00:18.939> virtual

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:19.150 
when the Train is close to the virtual

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.409 
when the Train is close to the virtual
train<00:00:19.630> station<00:00:20.310> or<00:00:21.310> we<00:00:21.730> can<00:00:21.880> still<00:00:22.150> have<00:00:22.300> the

00:00:22.409 --> 00:00:22.419 
train station or we can still have the

00:00:22.419 --> 00:00:24.929 
train station or we can still have the
dragon<00:00:22.980> effectively<00:00:23.980> light<00:00:24.160> it<00:00:24.310> on<00:00:24.400> fire<00:00:24.460> the

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:24.939 
dragon effectively light it on fire the

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:30.450 
dragon effectively light it on fire the
fire<00:00:25.150> engine<00:00:25.329> consider

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:30.460 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.670 

attach<00:00:31.460> dynamic<00:00:32.060> behavior<00:00:32.509> so<00:00:32.810> like<00:00:32.989> dragons

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:33.680 
attach dynamic behavior so like dragons

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.950 
attach dynamic behavior so like dragons
breathe<00:00:33.920> fire

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:35.960 
breathe fire

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:41.030 
breathe fire
you<00:00:36.079> can<00:00:36.230> cut<00:00:36.530> your<00:00:36.710> house

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:50.090 

fire<00:00:41.580> engines<00:00:42.030> have<00:00:42.330> fire<00:00:43.110> putting<00:00:43.470> MP

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:51.750 

so<00:00:50.609> we're<00:00:50.730> using

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:51.760 
so we're using

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.180 
so we're using
the<00:00:52.329> new<00:00:52.570> Intel<00:00:52.960> Sandy<00:00:53.289> Bridge<00:00:53.379> platform

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:54.190 
the new Intel Sandy Bridge platform

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.450 
the new Intel Sandy Bridge platform
to<00:00:54.340> run<00:00:54.550> all<00:00:54.820> of<00:00:54.850> these<00:00:55.059> underlying<00:00:55.420> processes

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:57.460 
to run all of these underlying processes

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.130 
to run all of these underlying processes
behind<00:00:58.059> the<00:00:58.210> scenes<00:00:58.450> of<00:00:58.570> a<00:00:58.660> multi-threaded

00:00:59.130 --> 00:00:59.140 
behind the scenes of a multi-threaded

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.080 
behind the scenes of a multi-threaded
way<00:00:59.530> which<00:00:59.800> allows<00:01:00.100> us<00:01:00.309> to<00:01:00.460> create<00:01:00.640> these<00:01:00.879> men

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:01.090 
way which allows us to create these men

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:03.299 
way which allows us to create these men
of<00:01:01.210> new<00:01:01.420> experiences<00:01:01.899> that<00:01:02.680> look<00:01:02.920> nothing

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:03.309 
of new experiences that look nothing

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:05.030 
of new experiences that look nothing
like<00:01:03.340> conventional<00:01:04.210> xperia

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
like conventional xperia

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.510 
like conventional xperia
so<00:01:05.460> there's<00:01:05.640> no<00:01:06.260> TV<00:01:07.260> display<00:01:07.770> laptop

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
so there's no TV display laptop

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:15.210 
so there's no TV display laptop
computers<00:01:09.210> in<00:01:09.480> the<00:01:09.690> background<00:01:10.200> saying

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:15.220 

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:17.820 

I've<00:01:16.220> been<00:01:16.430> living

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:17.830 
I've been living

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:31.410 
I've been living
your<00:01:18.370> interactive<00:01:18.940> service

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:31.420 

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.200 

we're<00:01:31.990> trying<00:01:32.140> to<00:01:32.409> show<00:01:33.310> here<00:01:33.340> is<00:01:33.700> that<00:01:33.850> unum

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.210 
we're trying to show here is that unum

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:35.850 
we're trying to show here is that unum
is<00:01:34.330> really<00:01:34.600> unexpected<00:01:35.049> kinds<00:01:35.799> of

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:35.860 
is really unexpected kinds of

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:36.990 
is really unexpected kinds of
experiences<00:01:36.220> even<00:01:36.580> though<00:01:36.759> there's<00:01:36.939> a

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:37.000 
experiences even though there's a

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.490 
experiences even though there's a
considerable<00:01:37.540> and<00:01:37.720> the<00:01:37.869> scenes<00:01:38.140> it<00:01:38.320> looks

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:38.500 
considerable and the scenes it looks

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.620 
considerable and the scenes it looks
nothing<00:01:38.740> like<00:01:38.950> what<00:01:39.369> you<00:01:39.430> might

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:42.630 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.320 

TV<00:01:43.350> this<00:01:43.560> way

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:45.330 
TV this way

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.649 
TV this way
all<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.690> objects

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:47.659 
all the objects

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:50.289 
all the objects
far<00:01:47.990> away<00:01:48.079> they<00:01:48.350> are<00:01:48.380> two<00:01:48.740> other<00:01:48.950> things<00:01:49.340> are

00:01:50.289 --> 00:01:50.299 
far away they are two other things are

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:51.999 
far away they are two other things are
all<00:01:50.450> taken<00:01:50.780> into<00:01:50.990> account<00:01:51.020> in<00:01:51.499> real<00:01:51.740> time

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:52.009 
all taken into account in real time

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:55.569 
all taken into account in real time
frame<00:01:52.369> by<00:01:52.520> frame<00:01:52.549> and<00:01:53.390> you<00:01:53.539> can<00:01:54.130> have<00:01:55.130> any<00:01:55.429> of

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:55.579 
frame by frame and you can have any of

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:57.249 
frame by frame and you can have any of
these<00:01:55.670> kind<00:01:56.000> of<00:01:56.060> virtual<00:01:56.299> objects<00:01:56.990> so<00:01:57.109> if<00:01:57.170> I

00:01:57.249 --> 00:01:57.259 
these kind of virtual objects so if I

00:01:57.259 --> 00:01:58.809 
these kind of virtual objects so if I
don't<00:01:57.409> have<00:01:57.530> a<00:01:57.560> real<00:01:57.770> train<00:01:58.130> station<00:01:58.579> I<00:01:58.670> can

00:01:58.809 --> 00:01:58.819 
don't have a real train station I can

00:01:58.819 --> 00:02:00.520 
don't have a real train station I can
just<00:01:58.939> download<00:01:59.090> a<00:01:59.390> virtual<00:01:59.810> one<00:01:59.990> drop<00:02:00.350> it

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
just download a virtual one drop it

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:02.679 
just download a virtual one drop it
wherever<00:02:00.679> I<00:02:00.859> want<00:02:01.130> and<00:02:01.819> we<00:02:01.939> can<00:02:02.060> still<00:02:02.329> detect

00:02:02.679 --> 00:02:02.689 
wherever I want and we can still detect

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:04.510 
wherever I want and we can still detect
when<00:02:03.079> the<00:02:03.200> Train<00:02:03.499> is<00:02:03.530> close<00:02:03.979> to<00:02:04.189> the<00:02:04.310> virtual

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520 
when the Train is close to the virtual

or<00:02:06.979> we<00:02:07.100> can<00:02:07.220> still<00:02:07.520> have<00:02:07.700> the<00:02:07.790> dragon

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:08.350 
or we can still have the dragon

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:10.540 
or we can still have the dragon
