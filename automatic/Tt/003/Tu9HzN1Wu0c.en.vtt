00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.819
 hello to all this little addition to my 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:07.680
 tutorial on exploring the tunes on 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.480
 will today see how to spot the 

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.790
 systems that have great potential at 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.590
 discovery level of your objects so 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.639
 you have several types of systems 

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.740
 already you have those who belong 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:18.750
 either the federation or the alpi ans 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:20.340
 are harkis like that those who 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.050
 do not belong to anyone what are 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.640
 two tenors like that so this you 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.930
 can find stuff but it's 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.099
 really lucky luck because 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.519
 that in general here you have that the 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.960
 discovery stars and that's not it 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.360
 possible to find stuff done but 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.520
 it's really on the edge and 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:41.570
 you have the systems that belong 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:41.570
 so one of the alliances or federation 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:46.050
 ah this is for example this system is 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.700
 that a high potential there you see it 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.930
 there are stations of a system it is necessary 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.460
 know that the stations are still in 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:52.500
 orbit around the planet or 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.910
 canvases has expired gold there as you can 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.079
 find out there is none next to this 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.579
 which means they are still summer 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.370
 discovery what keeps them from the fort 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:00.570
 potential so we'll see them and we 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.670
 go see them what can be learned but 

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:06.630
 it must be profitable so the system 

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:11.060
 it's al dr amine and to go there we go 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.060
 go through wolf 1084 it's gone 

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.100
 m 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:36.350
 eloi you are aiming love 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.350
 couple s merkel 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:46.370
 note that the rose to go up 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.200
 up to the arm what are far what 

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:50.979
 comes for exploration however 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.979
 really not great 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:06.530
 Yes 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.530
 we 

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:14.989
 completely and benali radine 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:18.660
 however to stay bad 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:19.600
 be careful though 

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:22.230
 because 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.230
 it's a service 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:28.710
 here we go 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:38.910
 How is he doing 

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:38.910
 the reich and inquiry 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.320
 people are dying and that often when 

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:00.300
 you arrive in a system move away 

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:02.040
 you already detect sounded 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:04.340
 simply by arriving in system without 

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.340
 even having 

00:03:04.719 --> 00:03:10.569
 we love what is always good 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.569
 return to the nearby oil scanner 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:19.990
 for example 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:19.990
 as well 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:29.410
 and that la la so this part we see 

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:32.760
 that there are several stations to wear and 

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:32.760
 sandra interview on the other hand 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:36.910
 so maybe I will not let the 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:39.239
 video was going so far because it's okay 

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:39.239
 to be extremely 

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.060
 but know that for example you have 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.060
 three stations 

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:47.990
 you have three stations that are in 

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:50.510
 orbit around that slab that are 

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:52.670
 necessarily in orbit around art around 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:54.410
 of a planet we do of a star we do not 

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:56.090
 not see here which means they 

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:56.840
 are detected are still detected so 

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:58.610
 it will bring 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:03:59.600
 so I will not do it entirely there 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:02.450
 because the video lasted longer 

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:06.700
 but you have I think seize 

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:06.700
 these islands concept on this to more
