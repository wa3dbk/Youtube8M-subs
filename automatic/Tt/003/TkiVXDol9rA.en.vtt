00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:31.370 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:33.790 

sort<00:01:32.090> of<00:01:32.150> movies<00:01:32.570> is<00:01:33.170> probably<00:01:33.500> the<00:01:33.620> first

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:33.800 
sort of movies is probably the first

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.080 
sort of movies is probably the first
thing<00:01:33.950> that<00:01:34.070> will<00:01:34.280> take<00:01:34.430> inspiration<00:01:34.700> from

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
thing that will take inspiration from

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.480 
thing that will take inspiration from
because<00:01:35.450> what<00:01:36.200> we<00:01:36.320> see<00:01:36.530> knows<00:01:36.800> you<00:01:37.070> can't<00:01:37.280> see

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:37.490 
because what we see knows you can't see

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:39.970 
because what we see knows you can't see
it's<00:01:37.940> not<00:01:38.120> it's<00:01:38.510> added<00:01:39.110> at<00:01:39.200> yeah<00:01:39.440> so<00:01:39.560> you<00:01:39.740> don't

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:39.980 
it's not it's added at yeah so you don't

see<00:01:40.130> it<00:01:40.250> it's<00:01:40.430> not<00:01:40.550> something<00:01:40.850> you<00:01:40.880> can<00:01:40.940> take

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:41.210 
see it it's not something you can take

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:43.540 
see it it's not something you can take

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
they automatically you know to say

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:58.540 
they automatically you know to say
something<00:01:57.650> and<00:01:57.740> they<00:01:57.830> can<00:01:57.980> react<00:01:58.220> off<00:01:58.400> the

00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:58.550 
something and they can react off the

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:01.420 
something and they can react off the
word<00:01:58.730> whereas<00:01:59.690> I<00:01:59.900> don't<00:02:00.350> have<00:02:00.920> those<00:02:01.070> to<00:02:01.310> do

guess and we're taking it from the
approach<00:03:57.850> of<00:03:59.490> humanity<00:04:00.490> for<00:04:00.700> him<00:04:00.850> for<00:04:01.480> looking

00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:01.870 
approach of humanity for him for looking

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:05.480 
approach of humanity for him for looking
at<00:04:02.020> how<00:04:02.410> it<00:04:02.590> is<00:04:02.680> for<00:04:02.950> him<00:04:03.069> to<00:04:03.100> love<00:04:03.450> you<00:04:04.450> know<00:04:04.930> he

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:05.490 
at how it is for him to love you know he

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:09.900 
at how it is for him to love you know he
he's<00:04:06.490> immortal<00:04:06.790> he<00:04:07.120> lives<00:04:07.330> for<00:04:08.670> forever<00:04:09.670> and

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:09.910 
he's immortal he lives for forever and

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:12.990 
he's immortal he lives for forever and
then<00:04:10.480> you<00:04:11.230> know<00:04:11.350> how<00:04:11.470> does<00:04:11.650> he<00:04:11.800> deal<00:04:12.040> with<00:04:12.070> that

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:13.000 
then you know how does he deal with that

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.550 
then you know how does he deal with that
side<00:04:13.270> of<00:04:13.300> his<00:04:13.480> life<00:04:13.660> and<00:04:13.810> nothing<00:04:13.900> he<00:04:14.200> falls<00:04:14.410> in

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:21.750 
he wants to it's just what happens and
it's<00:04:20.470> how<00:04:20.590> you're<00:04:21.220> dealing<00:04:21.400> with<00:04:21.579> the

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:21.760 
it's how you're dealing with the

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:25.960 
and instead of just taking it from the

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.360 
and instead of just taking it from the
point<00:04:26.110> of<00:04:26.260> he's<00:04:26.410> just<00:04:26.590> using<00:04:26.770> his<00:04:27.040> power<00:04:27.250> and

00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:27.370

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:33.970 
like how he might actually feel how

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:35.580

human emotion I think we see a lot of

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:42.540 
human emotion I think we see a lot of
his<00:04:40.540> humanity<00:04:40.840> in<00:04:41.230> this<00:04:41.380> piece<00:04:41.620> I<00:04:41.890> think<00:04:42.280> he
