00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:25.710
 and so ladies and gentlemen or in our case 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.530
 more correctly probably gentlemen and ladies 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:29.990
 I welcome everyone who loves this 

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:33.210

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.970
 knows broadcasts that now on screens 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:40.290
 shipping 14 drilling and this bastard under 

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:41.520
 the glass dome which you are now 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.300
 see on your screens 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:47.640
 this is a creation of american industry 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:49.830
 i don't know light or hard but we 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.530
 this country and little control of the car 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:54.690
 relationship we don't have our table hockey 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:58.739
 This is Swedish standard stiga 

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:00.690
 playoff model so final series 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.970
 stage of the world tour of the big series 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.700
 Six Riga as it is like your 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:07.860
 This is the sixth match in the series 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:11.040
 32 here you now see on the screens 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:13.020
 score of the match in favor of the maxim Borisov 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.420
 previous concern as we already had 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.590
 opportunity to see and unconditional 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.320
 advantage of boris in some 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:22.170
 components and incredible just i would 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:24.090
 became trick goals this site with and 

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.040
 brand comeback maxim and when you 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.650
 literally 1 minute from within created 

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.470
 53 its favor and here is the sixth match of the series 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.920
 we can now see how he is 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:35.130
 will be 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:36.780
 see and here is the first I am such a goal 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.660
 Maxim Borisov scores at first 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:41.850
 seconds of the match something is not discarded 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:46.830
 liked maxim he asked for trying 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:49.920
 repeat here Edgars was wrong given 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:52.620
 The situation a little believed that it would be either 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:55.710
 for if western and yanked the goalkeeper from 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:58.020
 corner here is another point maltseva not 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:01.170
 Frequently performed by Boris Maltsev Shiba 

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:04.140
 swept down the line for help it's 10 in 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:08.670
 the sixth match of the final series 32 in favor 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:12.390
 Maxim Borisov Well, now pass on 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:14.459
 no way out implemented the typical such 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:17.760
 passport not rpg from maxim borisov 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:19.860
 on the right and on the right mostly mine 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:22.960
 so prefers to act borisov 

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:25.730
 and on the left, by the way 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:29.810
 much more annoying 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:32.060
 game maxim and short and 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:35.360
 throws in the near corner and, respectively 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:37.099
 a groove on top of the exit with fought for 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.769
 sport puck and in the end 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:41.540
 but by the way interesting point yes I already 

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:42.830
 said our table hockey is 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.590
 swedish stiga player 

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:48.230
 but recently more and more players 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:51.140
 go 2 organizers forget maxim 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:53.780
 borisov exit bun putter yet 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:55.280
 the special says so here and the players 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:59.060
 organizers are increasingly faced with 

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:02.299
 problem 30 already see borisov one more 

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:04.790
 . bun does not give me maxim to tell 

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:06.489
 about the problems of the manufacturer so that's all 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:09.019
 more often we run into a problem 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:11.359
 karimov ice or no steps yes 

00:03:09.019 --> 00:03:13.430
 especially left-handed hitters 

00:03:11.359 --> 00:03:15.109
 put something under the ice to 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.840
 level this surface 

00:03:15.109 --> 00:03:19.129
 well and here here is clearly a dollar down to 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.650
 such a degree that 

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:24.560
 the back of the ice that runs the board 

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:26.510
 It became noticeably higher and appeared in 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.910
 step in the reverse brake which you 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:33.430
 putter clung to the bar for straight work 

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:36.919
 washers in 40 in favor of Borisov 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:38.620
 This is the assessment that Borisov himself set . 

00:03:36.919 --> 00:03:41.090
 for this goal 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:43.639
 a freebie a freebie of course but in this 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:46.040
 situations he quickly figured out and 

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:49.010
 ferried the puck from the disputed territory 

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:52.489
 opponent's gate and this is already overdone 

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:54.739
 a little and the door from so tightly closed 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:57.200
 its center forward that cap 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:58.639
 gone under the ice and almost ripped up 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:01.250
 this surface 

00:03:58.639 --> 00:04:03.500
 Well, it happens so much hockey 

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:05.750
 despite the fact that in Latvia under the ice as 

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:09.049
 since there is a special device for 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:11.480
 under the glue enclosed to just 

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:13.669
 the slots did not lengthen the central 

00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:17.090
 forward striker Borisov scored 

00:04:13.669 --> 00:04:18.739
 another short one is still getting 50 well 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:21.139
 for this you can probably 

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:22.400
 actually put the top five Davy 

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:25.250
 the scoreboard itself 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:28.280
 sisters demonstrate superiority 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:31.190
 forcibly borisov in this sixth match 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:35.449
 the final series and to victory he left 

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:37.060
 quite a bit of Borisov 

00:04:35.449 --> 00:04:39.740
 to amuse the audience with your grades 

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:41.900
 exhibited unsatisfactory for 

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:45.050
 execution output and in the meantime 

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:47.300
 opened punished him for it 

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:50.660
 having implemented such a throw poke 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:53.449
 short circuit after a pass to the right striker 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:55.970
 almost flat center makes movement 

00:04:53.449 --> 00:04:57.860
 forward i strive it seems to me just 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:58.639
 hit the target in the past 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:00.979
 reports 

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:04.220
 Mikhail Spivakovsky called this 

00:05:00.979 --> 00:05:06.289
 a combination of simple bananas in the far well not 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:09.110
 I know that such a name came from honestly 

00:05:06.289 --> 00:05:14.060
 give, in principle, does not matter the goal he and 

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:16.810
 have a bolt this score we have a match 51 

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:19.639
 I use Borisov to hurry 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:22.759
 clearly the address is hidden here now visible 

00:05:19.639 --> 00:05:23.360
 down the street he is not happy though 

00:05:22.759 --> 00:05:25.580
 attempts 

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:28.030
 how to cling to this match 

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:31.310
 trying to fight but of course 

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:33.380
 play such an advantage in Borisov 

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:37.449
 especially as it remains to have already left 

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:43.219
 less than a minute can only borisov 

00:05:37.449 --> 00:05:45.919
 pass to exit tried the trick element 

00:05:43.219 --> 00:05:49.580
 fulfill borisov and got a goal in his 

00:05:45.919 --> 00:05:52.039
 gate 25 40 with a few seconds to 

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:55.909
 end for pro forma I will say 

00:05:52.039 --> 00:05:58.550
 I said the main time match 

00:05:55.909 --> 00:06:02.990
 about the history of the confrontation of two masters 

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:05.139
 and increased motivation but see how 

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:07.930
 fighting king savior 

00:06:05.139 --> 00:06:11.379
 loses decides proved you are unlikely 

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:14.289
 does believe in success well nevertheless well done 

00:06:11.379 --> 00:06:17.740
 fights until the end of the word clean one more 

00:06:14.289 --> 00:06:19.689
 goal scored 35 already well, of course, that 

00:06:17.740 --> 00:06:23.800
 no country is played but fights until 

00:06:19.689 --> 00:06:25.960
 the end of what is ten seconds with us 

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:27.819
 left in this match and you can already 

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:30.699
 I begin to think of congratulating Borisov 

00:06:27.819 --> 00:06:33.810
 which was holding here is another frog in 

00:06:30.699 --> 00:06:36.849
 imprisoned who won 

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:39.580
 the fourteenth rebecca stage of the world 

00:06:36.849 --> 00:06:41.889
 tour big six really stress 

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:45.009
 this tournament is certainly deserved 

00:06:41.889 --> 00:06:48.219
 applause very beautiful bright series 

00:06:45.009 --> 00:06:51.009
 and now greetings from teammate 

00:06:48.219 --> 00:06:53.409
 I give birth to the lamp 

00:06:51.009 --> 00:06:55.509
 Spivakovsky four fives agree 

00:06:53.409 --> 00:06:57.789
 perhaps very high quality confident 

00:06:55.509 --> 00:06:58.860
 spent boris in this series lit up 

00:06:57.789 --> 00:07:00.580
 just in frame 

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:03.099
 president of the international federation 

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:06.270
 steel hockey bjarni maxim center but 

00:07:03.099 --> 00:07:06.270
 now the floor is a winner 

00:07:07.139 --> 00:07:12.120
 not crying will feel 

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:13.770
 Well, that's what I felt, I think 

00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:16.920
 max gave a rating 

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:20.340
 very decent probably considered here 

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:22.350
 such pushups quotes pull-ups 

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:24.930
 after the tournament i to maintain 

00:07:22.350 --> 00:07:27.570

 cup league as a bonus tv 

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:39.440
 diploma and something else and deserved 

00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:41.760
 praise from the office of Sirius 

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:44.670
 decent such he helped the caretakers 

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:48.350
 sit here for all the sporting success until 

00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:48.350
 new meetings to play table hockey
