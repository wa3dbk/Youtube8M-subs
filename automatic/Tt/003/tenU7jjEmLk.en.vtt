00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:09.230
 the basis of this adapter, I decided to take 

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:12.690
 scheme 

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:15.570
 front adapter about two times 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:18.630
 best tractive performance and gonna be 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:20.400
 tell on the system that's front 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:26.220
 beam here everything is clearly visible she 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:27.990
 has an u-shape that's this front 

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:30.929
 suspension from aki 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.540
 actually the exact same suspension y 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.370
 Eight nines many other machines have 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:39.480
 we are standing below 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:43.640
 ball from him is a long rod there 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:47.039
 You can clearly see that I cut her 

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:51.059
 on top this is the place to mount you there 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:54.420
 visible holes here it is put 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:56.579
 the rack that I took sentenced here 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:59.550
 Here are two of these little corner and also put 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:02.329
 here the ball joint respectively 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:03.979
 a scrap here from that bottom detail 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:07.610
 used here 

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:09.810
 I connected them here with a simple pipe 

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.720
 accordingly it turned out the same 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.180
 construction on the left and on the right here 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.640
 grenade residue 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:21.590
 which is bearing all very 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:24.360
 rotates easily and in quality 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:28.860
 steering gear shot broken a 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:31.310
 scrap metal pipe inside 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:35.250
 which are crackers 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:37.290
 shaft made the right length took straight to 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:41.750
 of this emergency he is a little bit bent 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:45.180
 steering wheel and kissed here this one 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:50.549
 cardan I broke and and used it 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:52.439
 immediately like drying on the other hand here 

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:56.670
 since it is tubular 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:59.549
 I strengthened it with a corner and entered here 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:02.100
 by peasant I just put here 

00:01:59.549 --> 00:02:04.799
 ball fell against him 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:07.380
 ok here i welded and handed out on 

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:08.550
 native tail rods here and on the steering wheel and 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.880
 enter she 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.230
 and here accordingly turned out 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:16.560
 the design is very simple 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.960
 cheap fast going well 

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:22.310
 only inconvenience as with any 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.520
 work is quite difficult to do in 1 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:26.940
 result 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:31.860
 Well, now I will show this 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:34.580
 the steering system works like this 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:42.030
 yes that is practically absent 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:47.670
 load on the steering wheel in the network in front of her beam 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:50.790
 I have done here based on 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:55.100
 scheme tractor Belarus here it is the pipe 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:55.100
 here is the kind of shaft that will weld here
