on the other side of the wheel weight
clip<00:03:40.900> right<00:03:41.079> now<00:03:41.290> so<00:03:41.680> we're<00:03:41.859> going<00:03:42.010> to<00:03:42.100> what's

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:51.250 
okay we're going to do one final check

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:52.860 
okay we're going to do one final check
to<00:03:51.370> make<00:03:51.460> sure<00:03:51.520> it's<00:03:51.880> on<00:03:52.120> there<00:03:52.180> the<00:03:52.630> way<00:03:52.720> we
