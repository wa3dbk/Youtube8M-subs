00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:18.640
 was presented to the five most prototypes 

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:21.310
 breakers of the gin room and with the 

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:23.439
 number five this volkswagen sport coupe 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:25.779
 gti a model that the German brand 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:27.849
 wants to position between the phaeton and the 

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:30.550
 passat although what I see here is a 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:32.169
 clear replacement of the cc and is that account 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:34.780
 with a large boot a few practices 

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:37.030
 rear seats and a very very interior 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:39.850
 technological under the hood a system 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:42.120
 hybrid of 380 horses we go for the 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:42.120
 port 

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:53.260
 I'm in lexus because your little one is the 

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:55.780
 s / a breaks molds who was going to tell me 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:57.670
 me that a luxury brand like lexus will 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.129
 I was going to be interested in a segment of 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:03.039
 utilitarian well here we have it a 

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:05.379
 Very small car with a sub body 

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:07.330
 will come from the future because everything depends on 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:10.799
 the reception you have here in the room and 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.799
 from what we see it looks like it's good 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.380
 we get to number 3 with this dance and xp 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.880
 a model that has been manufactured 

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:32.460
 absolutely in an artisan way with a 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.679
 very high quality interior and some 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.229
 very exclusive materials such as wood 

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:39.149
 cherry tree sells and says that it has 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:43.159
 inspired by the fuselage and the wings of 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:43.159
 an airplane for your design there is nothing 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:57.220
 with the number 2 the infinity 60 with being 

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:58.360
 a model that as you see is going to take the 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:59.740
 production because the good thing that has 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.500
 this brand is that all its prototypes 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:04.900
 they end up in a street car so that 

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.610
 prepare the audio at 5 and the bmw s at 4 

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:09.100
 because they get a rival care 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:11.530
 under 470 meters in length it hides 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:13.300
 a 3-liter v6 engine traction at 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:15.520
 four wheels and a gearbox 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:20.100
 seven - speed automatic and now 

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:20.100
 yes what will be the number one let's see it 

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:34.150
 we come to audio to meet the 

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:36.400
 avant prologue with more than five meters of 

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:38.590
 length and four comfortable seats in a 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:41.080
 minimalist design interior and very 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:43.360
 technological with several screens oled e 

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:47.230
 distributed throughout the cabin under 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:48.930
 the bonnet a 456 horsepower hybrid engine 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.850
 that provide benefits 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:54.070
 bright and up to here the five 

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:58.140
 most disruptive prototypes between the living room 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:58.140
