00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.780
 hi everyone guys are more than 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.330
 welcome to this new video or 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:09.300
 at least mini videos where we will talk about 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.340
 now driven back, pittsburgh guests 

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:13.040
 for this game guys this day 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.199
 so very soon a simulator 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.609
 and not carpentry simulator but 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:19.830
 I had to go and collect wood 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.820
 wood then program to destination 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.210
 etc. etc. 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.590
 let's start with a tiny gip is 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.420
 a small cannon 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.369
 that's because the guys because it's the jeep 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:33.390
 Now I'll explain a couple of things to you if I 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:35.750
 I do for example no change truck ok 

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:39.719
 ok and let's just go to the jeep 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:42.510
 the jeep is one of the small trailers from the 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:44.430
 schooners just barely discard why 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:46.890
 allows us to go around to 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.860
 collect trucks where quotation marks are placed 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:52.320
 if in case we get bogged down 50 niamo 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.539
 the mud many this game turns 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.870
 all in the mud in a lot of trucks 

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:59.670
 powerful with lots of cart wheels 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.199
 armed then much more lover of the game yes 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.280
 they will block many more trucks 

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.140
 etc. etc. 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.030
 this we can go to the cippus 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.939
 to recover the bogged-down trucks 

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.280
 a helping hand and above all giving them 

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:13.439
 now apple orchards in stall the trunk the trunk 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.970
 transport to 200 repair points because 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:18.119
 the truck suffers damage 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.830
 as you can see below damage 0 300 if 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.520
 this blue path should suffer 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.770
 of damage 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.070
 thanks to the gip, look at repairing like 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:29.280
 200 here says of damage now is for example 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.990
 let's change the truck and here too we can 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:34.560
 install it for something else, for example 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:38.100
 we now have a spring a spring a 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.890
 ok and we put them trailer towing no 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:44.189
 sometimes axon limits we can put them 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:46.439
 the box we can put the big box on 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.939
 we put them as penn per game 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.200
 words boys when they tell by wood 

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:51.360
 but for the moment we have to unlock 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.579
 other things because pressing f1 papam pete 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.180
 we have a map yet to be unlocked 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:58.380
 because there are hidden places 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:00.390
 blackened where we give them a pass 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:01.710
 through to unlock them boy is a 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:03.420
 I play a little weak because a 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:06.030
 I know I will do some videos every simulator 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:07.530
 so much of those in the usual comments one 

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.789
 series I don't know but I do n't think I make one 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.410
 series I think I make some videos 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:12.360
 Fool around even advanced videos 

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.230
 to explain some things but 

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:17.400
 mostly 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:20.069
 so maybe we start the engine I'm in 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.049
 to say something I'm going to go live 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:24.390
 with this game on the center of the inter 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:26.580
 description so exactly as I said 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:28.739
 first I do not play with quotation marks motion ed 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.239
 is a classic live game 

00:02:28.739 --> 00:02:34.379
 guys I'm going to do immediately 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:36.209
 mission that is to go go to 

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:37.170
 destination I can even even 

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:38.670
 put the destination 

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.930
 when you have come to pay 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:41.069
 of the water so for me it will be 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:47.329
 impossible at the beginning they have 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:49.440
 almost ok simple destination simple 

00:02:47.329 --> 00:02:52.170
 you will want to see it on the map 

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.120
 here for example starting in the mud a 

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.280
 I put a bit of graphics on guys 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.140
 because it is thanks to my video card is 

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.090
 too powerful for these games is 

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:01.200
 otherwise I have to pass the graphics 

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:02.970
 for any crashes 

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.280
 look at us here for sure 

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:06.629
 we bog the oils also installed 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:13.160
 chains on the wheels 

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:13.160
 and indeed we have already met there 

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:19.790
 there really is no looking for the road anymore 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.439
 right as possible but now the truck 

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:23.689
 thought that empty think when it 

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:26.840
 we will fill with wood that is just the 

00:03:23.689 --> 00:03:30.709
 heaviness allows us to get bogged down 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:33.319
 still before ok but for me it will be 

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:35.780
 impossible to pass it or whatever it is 

00:03:33.319 --> 00:03:39.129
 need a lot of patience and slowly 

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:41.769
 we could even make it by wanting 

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:44.780
 wishing we were stuck 

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:47.359
 ok now what do you care guys understood v 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.829
 nor can we even watch each other 

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:51.290
 for example a tree this is a 

00:03:48.829 --> 00:03:53.239
 twig cannot be standing in 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:55.670
 surroundings we can tie for example a 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:57.319
 tree in tree and give us the push o 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:59.599
 let us even pull from the tree 

00:03:57.319 --> 00:04:01.790
 let us pull from the tree felt in the 

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:03.889
 guys is better than most of the video and there 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:06.230
 let's see for those who want live alerts 

00:04:03.889 --> 00:04:08.180
 relatives and friends with comments 

00:04:06.230 --> 00:04:09.739
 especially if you want other types of 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:10.940
 video an arm kiss as in the 

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:12.739
 Usually boys this game I 

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:15.049
 bought the team this morning to me 

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:16.519
 I'm a good Sunday gift 

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:19.449
 Sunday all a kiss and hug 

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:19.449
 bye Bye
