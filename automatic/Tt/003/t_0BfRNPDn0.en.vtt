make their multiplayer better well one I

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:05.920 
make their multiplayer better well one I
do<00:01:03.979> think<00:01:04.400> it<00:01:04.610> was<00:01:04.640> a<00:01:04.729> little<00:01:04.970> bit<00:01:05.180> dark<00:01:05.630> of

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:05.930 
do think it was a little bit dark of

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.050 
do think it was a little bit dark of
course<00:01:06.229> it's<00:01:06.409> Batman<00:01:06.890> it<00:01:07.100> has<00:01:07.310> to<00:01:07.549> be<00:01:07.640> dark<00:01:07.909> I

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
course it's Batman it has to be dark I

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:09.969 
course it's Batman it has to be dark I
mean<00:01:08.090> he's<00:01:08.330> the<00:01:08.360> Dark<00:01:08.780> Knight<00:01:09.080> but<00:01:09.320> I<00:01:09.710> think

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:09.979 
mean he's the Dark Knight but I think

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:11.469 
mean he's the Dark Knight but I think
they<00:01:10.070> could<00:01:10.280> brighten<00:01:10.610> it<00:01:10.760> up<00:01:10.880> just<00:01:11.090> a<00:01:11.240> little

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:11.479 
they could brighten it up just a little

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:13.240 
they could brighten it up just a little
bit<00:01:11.600> just<00:01:11.930> to<00:01:12.080> get<00:01:12.229> a<00:01:12.260> good<00:01:12.530> feeling<00:01:12.860> of<00:01:13.070> where

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:13.250 
bit just to get a good feeling of where

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.609 
bit just to get a good feeling of where
you<00:01:13.430> are<00:01:13.670> like<00:01:14.390> they<00:01:14.750> can<00:01:14.960> make<00:01:15.170> it<00:01:15.350> nighttime

00:01:15.609 --> 00:01:15.619 
you are like they can make it nighttime

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:17.499 
you are like they can make it nighttime
still<00:01:16.100> but<00:01:16.310> just<00:01:16.520> make<00:01:16.670> the<00:01:16.790> actual<00:01:16.909> screen

00:01:17.499 --> 00:01:17.509 
still but just make the actual screen

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:19.749 
still but just make the actual screen
brighter<00:01:17.810> or<00:01:18.079> any<00:01:18.380> really<00:01:19.039> way<00:01:19.189> to<00:01:19.250> make<00:01:19.520> that

00:01:19.749 --> 00:01:19.759 
brighter or any really way to make that

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:22.419 
brighter or any really way to make that
better<00:01:20.299> so<00:01:20.990> one<00:01:21.500> thing<00:01:21.649> I<00:01:21.770> think<00:01:21.829> they<00:01:22.070> didn't

00:01:22.419 --> 00:01:22.429 
better so one thing I think they didn't

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:24.219 
better so one thing I think they didn't
really<00:01:22.520> have<00:01:22.759> is<00:01:22.939> they<00:01:23.060> had<00:01:23.210> one<00:01:23.479> mode<00:01:23.719> that's

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:24.229 
really have is they had one mode that's

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:27.399 
really have is they had one mode that's
it<00:01:24.409> I<00:01:24.590> mean<00:01:25.149> it<00:01:26.149> may<00:01:26.299> look<00:01:26.509> like<00:01:26.570> a<00:01:26.780> prototype

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:27.409 
it I mean it may look like a prototype

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:29.050 
it I mean it may look like a prototype
almost<00:01:27.799> it's<00:01:28.009> just<00:01:28.219> like<00:01:28.520> that's<00:01:28.729> all<00:01:28.939> you

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 
almost it's just like that's all you

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:30.730 
almost it's just like that's all you
could<00:01:29.179> do<00:01:29.359> I<00:01:29.570> know<00:01:29.840> they're<00:01:30.109> added<00:01:30.439> they<00:01:30.530> added

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:30.740 
could do I know they're added they added

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:32.739 
could do I know they're added they added
like<00:01:30.859> a<00:01:30.950> second<00:01:31.340> mode<00:01:31.490> and<00:01:32.149> that's<00:01:32.479> it<00:01:32.630> like

00:01:32.739 --> 00:01:32.749 
like a second mode and that's it like

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:33.730 
like a second mode and that's it like
there's<00:01:32.929> just<00:01:32.960> two<00:01:33.200> different<00:01:33.380> game<00:01:33.710> modes

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 
there's just two different game modes

think<00:03:12.019> they<00:03:12.079> should<00:03:12.290> make<00:03:12.319> it<00:03:12.470> almost<00:03:13.159> like

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:13.400 
think they should make it almost like

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.849 
think they should make it almost like
slot<00:03:13.940> classes<00:03:14.480> they<00:03:14.750> should<00:03:14.959> have<00:03:15.139> prestiging

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:15.859 
slot classes they should have prestiging

00:03:15.859 --> 00:03:18.940 
slot classes they should have prestiging
where<00:03:16.400> the<00:03:16.940> person<00:03:17.269> is<00:03:17.420> encouraged<00:03:18.019> to<00:03:18.200> want

00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:18.950 
where the person is encouraged to want

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:20.770 
where the person is encouraged to want
to<00:03:19.040> keep<00:03:19.159> on<00:03:19.310> playing<00:03:19.639> to<00:03:19.909> unlock<00:03:19.940> more<00:03:20.510> things

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
to keep on playing to unlock more things

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.020 
to keep on playing to unlock more things
that<00:03:20.959> no<00:03:21.170> like<00:03:21.859> the<00:03:22.040> origins<00:03:22.430> multiplier<00:03:22.879> do

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
that no like the origins multiplier do

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:24.789 
that no like the origins multiplier do
that<00:03:23.180> but<00:03:23.420> it's<00:03:23.840> not<00:03:23.959> really<00:03:24.079> it<00:03:24.379> really<00:03:24.530> hit

00:03:24.789 --> 00:03:24.799 
that but it's not really it really hit

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:26.140 
that but it's not really it really hit
you<00:03:24.920> in<00:03:24.980> the<00:03:25.010> face<00:03:25.220> like<00:03:25.430> boom<00:03:25.700> this<00:03:25.879> is<00:03:25.940> what

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:26.150 
you in the face like boom this is what

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:28.059 
you in the face like boom this is what
you<00:03:26.209> can<00:03:26.329> do<00:03:26.510> and<00:03:26.720> different<00:03:27.440> modes<00:03:27.620> is<00:03:27.859> the

00:03:28.059 --> 00:03:28.069 
you can do and different modes is the

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:30.220 
you can do and different modes is the
big<00:03:28.280> thing<00:03:28.310> I<00:03:28.609> feel<00:03:28.819> you<00:03:28.879> should<00:03:29.030> have<00:03:29.239> at

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
big thing I feel you should have at

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:32.259 
big thing I feel you should have at
least<00:03:30.290> five<00:03:30.829> different<00:03:31.190> modes<00:03:31.549> maybe<00:03:31.940> like

00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:32.269 
least five different modes maybe like

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:34.539 
least five different modes maybe like
five<00:03:32.540> I<00:03:32.989> would<00:03:33.169> prefer<00:03:33.319> like<00:03:33.739> nine<00:03:34.040> or<00:03:34.069> twelve

00:03:34.539 --> 00:03:34.549 
five I would prefer like nine or twelve

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:37.360 
five I would prefer like nine or twelve
but<00:03:35.269> like<00:03:35.510> just<00:03:35.959> different<00:03:36.379> modes<00:03:36.560> I<00:03:36.739> mean<00:03:36.949> got

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:37.370 
but like just different modes I mean got

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:39.189 
but like just different modes I mean got
three<00:03:37.639> versus<00:03:38.090> what<00:03:38.569> are<00:03:38.629> the<00:03:38.690> three<00:03:38.870> first<00:03:39.079> is

00:03:39.189 --> 00:03:39.199 
three versus what are the three first is

00:03:39.199 --> 00:03:41.140 
three versus what are the three first is
two<00:03:39.319> versus<00:03:39.650> two<00:03:39.680> I<00:03:40.040> mean<00:03:40.519> or<00:03:40.669> three<00:03:40.819> versus

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150 
two versus two I mean or three versus

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.360 
two versus two I mean or three versus
three<00:03:41.180> verses<00:03:41.690> to<00:03:41.870> why<00:03:42.379> don't<00:03:42.590> you<00:03:42.650> do<00:03:42.829> a<00:03:42.859> big

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
three verses to why don't you do a big

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.520 
three verses to why don't you do a big
mode<00:03:43.639> look<00:03:44.090> like<00:03:44.239> a<00:03:44.329> Sandlot<00:03:44.810> mode<00:03:45.109> which<00:03:45.379> is

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:45.530 
mode look like a Sandlot mode which is

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:49.689 
mode look like a Sandlot mode which is
like<00:03:45.940> 16<00:03:46.940> verses<00:03:47.510> 16<00:03:47.840> and<00:03:48.290> I<00:03:48.919> know<00:03:48.980> there<00:03:49.280> isn't

00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:49.699 
like 16 verses 16 and I know there isn't

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:52.479 
like 16 verses 16 and I know there isn't

like I know 16 bat-family characters it

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:54.479 
like I know 16 bat-family characters it
doesn't<00:03:52.970> matter<00:03:53.150> you<00:03:53.510> can<00:03:53.660> literally<00:03:53.900> have<00:03:54.139> I

we want is like a 16-5 16 would be

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:04.330 
we want is like a 16-5 16 would be
awesome<00:04:02.900> and<00:04:03.199> then<00:04:03.349> she'd<00:04:03.500> have<00:04:03.530> a<00:04:03.680> war<00:04:04.040> mode

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:04.340 
awesome and then she'd have a war mode

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:07.509 
awesome and then she'd have a war mode
where<00:04:04.760> the<00:04:05.120> instance<00:04:06.019> Batman<00:04:06.620> does<00:04:06.919> kill<00:04:07.280> and

00:04:07.509 --> 00:04:07.519 
where the instance Batman does kill and

00:04:07.519 --> 00:04:09.220 
where the instance Batman does kill and
for<00:04:07.819> the<00:04:07.910> only<00:04:08.060> reason<00:04:08.359> Batman<00:04:08.660> would<00:04:08.900> kill<00:04:09.109> on

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:09.230 
for the only reason Batman would kill on

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:11.710 
for the only reason Batman would kill on
this<00:04:09.349> war<00:04:09.650> mode<00:04:09.889> is<00:04:10.040> because<00:04:10.760> he<00:04:11.030> is<00:04:11.269> getting

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:11.720 
this war mode is because he is getting

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:13.149 
this war mode is because he is getting
controlled<00:04:12.109> by<00:04:12.260> something<00:04:12.530> so<00:04:12.709> let's<00:04:13.010> say

00:04:13.149 --> 00:04:13.159 
controlled by something so let's say

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:14.800 
controlled by something so let's say
you're<00:04:13.310> in<00:04:13.340> a<00:04:13.519> map<00:04:13.760> and<00:04:14.060> you<00:04:14.389> kind<00:04:14.569> of<00:04:14.599> look<00:04:14.750> at

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:14.810 
you're in a map and you kind of look at

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:16.750 
you're in a map and you kind of look at
a<00:04:14.840> tower<00:04:15.169> and<00:04:15.379> for<00:04:15.919> instance<00:04:16.039> a<00:04:16.340> character

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:16.760 
a tower and for instance a character

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:18.159 
a tower and for instance a character
they<00:04:16.909> can<00:04:17.060> choose<00:04:17.209> really<00:04:17.510> anything<00:04:17.780> like

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:18.169 
they can choose really anything like

00:04:18.169 --> 00:04:20.349 
they can choose really anything like
dark<00:04:19.039> side<00:04:19.280> or<00:04:19.489> something<00:04:19.729> really<00:04:19.970> cool<00:04:20.120> like

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:20.359 
dark side or something really cool like

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:21.909 
dark side or something really cool like
that<00:04:20.389> it's<00:04:20.720> just<00:04:20.810> controlling<00:04:21.320> the<00:04:21.620> bat

00:04:21.909 --> 00:04:21.919 
that it's just controlling the bat

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:24.010 
that it's just controlling the bat
characters<00:04:22.430> so<00:04:22.940> it's<00:04:23.180> just<00:04:23.330> an<00:04:23.389> all-out<00:04:23.599> war

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:24.020 
characters so it's just an all-out war

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:26.020 
characters so it's just an all-out war
between<00:04:24.050> nine<00:04:24.650> vs<00:04:25.099> 9<00:04:25.310> so<00:04:25.610> it's<00:04:25.729> pretty<00:04:25.880> much

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:26.030 
between nine vs 9 so it's pretty much

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:28.210 
between nine vs 9 so it's pretty much
just<00:04:26.090> like<00:04:26.389> this<00:04:26.659> these<00:04:27.530> nine<00:04:27.800> kills<00:04:28.099> that

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:28.220 
just like this these nine kills that

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:29.589 
just like this these nine kills that
night<00:04:28.430> kind<00:04:28.729> of<00:04:28.760> like<00:04:28.909> is<00:04:28.970> this<00:04:29.060> cod<00:04:29.270> you<00:04:29.479> know

00:04:29.589 --> 00:04:29.599 
night kind of like is this cod you know

00:04:29.599 --> 00:04:31.540 
night kind of like is this cod you know
it's<00:04:29.750> a<00:04:29.840> normal<00:04:30.169> game<00:04:30.409> mode<00:04:30.680> and<00:04:30.919> I<00:04:31.310> think<00:04:31.460> I'll

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:31.550 
it's a normal game mode and I think I'll

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:33.159 
it's a normal game mode and I think I'll
be<00:04:31.699> awesome<00:04:32.090> because<00:04:32.210> it's<00:04:32.510> like<00:04:32.659> full<00:04:33.020> out

00:04:33.159 --> 00:04:33.169 
be awesome because it's like full out

00:04:33.169 --> 00:04:35.469 
be awesome because it's like full out
just<00:04:33.530> like<00:04:33.680> Batman<00:04:34.250> thurs<00:04:34.639> battery<00:04:35.000> boom<00:04:35.270> he's

00:04:35.469 --> 00:04:35.479 
just like Batman thurs battery boom he's

00:04:35.479 --> 00:04:37.750 
just like Batman thurs battery boom he's
dead<00:04:35.510> you<00:04:35.780> get<00:04:36.050> points<00:04:36.260> to<00:04:36.530> level<00:04:36.620> up<00:04:36.950> and<00:04:37.070> like

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:37.760 
dead you get points to level up and like

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:39.399 
dead you get points to level up and like
it<00:04:37.880> could<00:04:38.000> be<00:04:38.030> a<00:04:38.090> little<00:04:38.330> bit<00:04:38.539> maybe<00:04:38.900> lighter<00:04:39.289> I

00:04:39.399 --> 00:04:39.409 
it could be a little bit maybe lighter I

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:40.870 
it could be a little bit maybe lighter I
think<00:04:39.650> they<00:04:39.740> should<00:04:39.950> have<00:04:39.979> like<00:04:40.370> a<00:04:40.550> few

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:40.880 
think they should have like a few

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.760 
think they should have like a few
stages<00:04:41.240> word<00:04:41.480> actually<00:04:41.660> is<00:04:41.990> like<00:04:42.260> once<00:04:42.500> again

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:42.770 
stages word actually is like once again

I don't like there is enough stages I

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:45.670 
I don't like there is enough stages I
just<00:04:44.570> think<00:04:44.690> this<00:04:44.810> whole<00:04:44.870> thing<00:04:45.050> was<00:04:45.320> lowered

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:46.700 
down I don't know if it's because the

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:48.550 
down I don't know if it's because the

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:24.820

encourage people to play more people

00:05:24.830 --> 00:05:26.590 
encourage people to play more people
would<00:05:24.890> get<00:05:25.130> the<00:05:25.280> game<00:05:25.460> maybe<00:05:26.000> even<00:05:26.210> a<00:05:26.390> for

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:26.600 
would get the game maybe even a for

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:29.470 
would get the game maybe even a for
multi<00:05:26.960> player<00:05:27.170> and<00:05:27.680> I<00:05:28.400> think<00:05:28.700> would<00:05:28.820> be<00:05:29.000> just

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:29.480 
multi player and I think would be just

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:30.910 
multi player and I think would be just
make<00:05:29.870> the<00:05:29.960> whole<00:05:29.990> game<00:05:30.320> better<00:05:30.560> like<00:05:30.740> I<00:05:30.860> don't

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:30.920 
make the whole game better like I don't

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:32.680 
make the whole game better like I don't
think<00:05:31.130> origins<00:05:31.580> multiplayer<00:05:31.670> was<00:05:32.360> good<00:05:32.600> at

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:32.690 
think origins multiplayer was good at

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:34.900 
think origins multiplayer was good at
all<00:05:32.840> I<00:05:33.050> just<00:05:33.470> don't<00:05:33.620> think<00:05:33.920> they<00:05:34.190> emphasize<00:05:34.700> it

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:34.910 
all I just don't think they emphasize it

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:36.190 
all I just don't think they emphasize it
enough<00:05:35.000> and<00:05:35.360> I<00:05:35.480> just<00:05:35.630> think<00:05:35.840> it<00:05:35.930> was<00:05:35.990> kind<00:05:36.170> of

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:36.200 
enough and I just think it was kind of

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:38.410 
enough and I just think it was kind of
like<00:05:36.320> a<00:05:36.380> rush<00:05:36.710> I<00:05:37.010> think<00:05:37.580> Rocksteady<00:05:38.150> should

00:05:38.410 --> 00:05:38.420 
like a rush I think Rocksteady should

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:39.880 
like a rush I think Rocksteady should
make<00:05:38.570> the<00:05:38.690> multiplayer<00:05:39.260> game<00:05:39.590> just<00:05:39.830> like

00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:39.890 
make the multiplayer game just like

00:05:39.890 --> 00:05:41.140 
make the multiplayer game just like
they'll<00:05:40.100> be<00:05:40.190> doing<00:05:40.310> for<00:05:40.580> the<00:05:40.640> fourth<00:05:40.910> game

00:05:41.140 --> 00:05:41.150 
they'll be doing for the fourth game

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:42.460 
they'll be doing for the fourth game
they<00:05:41.630> shouldn't<00:05:41.870> have<00:05:41.990> like<00:05:42.080> a<00:05:42.140> separate

00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:42.470 
they shouldn't have like a separate

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:44.110 
they shouldn't have like a separate
company<00:05:42.620> doing<00:05:43.010> it<00:05:43.250> it<00:05:43.370> should<00:05:43.520> be<00:05:43.550> the<00:05:43.730> same

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:44.120 
company doing it it should be the same

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:46.690 
company doing it it should be the same
game<00:05:44.480> just<00:05:45.050> in<00:05:45.200> multiplayer<00:05:45.710> and<00:05:46.400> there's

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:46.700 
game just in multiplayer and there's

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:48.010 
game just in multiplayer and there's
just<00:05:46.850> so<00:05:47.000> much<00:05:47.120> they<00:05:47.300> could<00:05:47.360> do<00:05:47.570> with<00:05:47.690> it<00:05:47.870> and

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:48.020 
just so much they could do with it and

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:49.540 
just so much they could do with it and
they<00:05:48.110> didn't<00:05:48.500> do<00:05:48.650> it<00:05:48.680> for<00:05:48.800> origins<00:05:49.280> which<00:05:49.430> is

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:49.550 
they didn't do it for origins which is

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:51.160 
they didn't do it for origins which is
disappointment<00:05:50.120> and<00:05:50.540> I<00:05:50.630> really<00:05:50.930> think<00:05:51.050> they

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:51.170 
disappointment and I really think they

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:53.140 
disappointment and I really think they
can<00:05:51.200> fix<00:05:51.380> that<00:05:51.770> for<00:05:52.280> of<00:05:52.520> course<00:05:52.730> the<00:05:52.940> fourth

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:53.150 
can fix that for of course the fourth

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:54.820 
can fix that for of course the fourth

for<00:06:04.940> instance<00:06:05.060> moves<00:06:05.750> like<00:06:05.930> a<00:06:05.990> predator

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:06.200 
for instance moves like a predator

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:07.600 
for instance moves like a predator
mission<00:06:06.710> where<00:06:06.830> you<00:06:06.920> actually<00:06:07.070> just<00:06:07.280> have

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:07.610 
mission where you actually just have

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:09.640 
mission where you actually just have
Batman<00:06:08.480> and<00:06:08.510> Robin<00:06:08.870> or<00:06:08.960> Batman<00:06:09.410> and<00:06:09.620> the

00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:09.650 
Batman and Robin or Batman and the

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:12.070 
Batman and Robin or Batman and the
choosing<00:06:10.160> sidekick<00:06:10.700> vs<00:06:11.210> let's<00:06:11.840> say<00:06:12.020> two

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:12.080 
choosing sidekick vs let's say two

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:13.450 
choosing sidekick vs let's say two
characters<00:06:12.650> and<00:06:12.770> it's<00:06:12.860> more<00:06:13.040> like<00:06:13.160> a<00:06:13.250> predator

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:13.460 
characters and it's more like a predator

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:15.640 
characters and it's more like a predator
type<00:06:13.880> map<00:06:14.120> but<00:06:14.750> I<00:06:14.780> think<00:06:15.050> there's<00:06:15.230> the<00:06:15.470> map

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:15.650 
type map but I think there's the map

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:17.200 
type map but I think there's the map
should<00:06:15.860> be<00:06:15.980> brighter<00:06:16.280> I<00:06:16.400> don't<00:06:16.670> like<00:06:16.790> the<00:06:16.910> feel

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:17.210 
should be brighter I don't like the feel

00:06:17.210 --> 00:06:19.150 
should be brighter I don't like the feel
of<00:06:17.240> it<00:06:17.540> and<00:06:17.840> there's<00:06:18.440> just<00:06:18.530> so<00:06:18.770> much<00:06:18.890> more<00:06:18.950> you

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:19.160 
of it and there's just so much more you

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:20.770 
of it and there's just so much more you
could<00:06:19.340> do<00:06:19.490> with<00:06:19.640> it<00:06:19.820> I<00:06:19.910> think<00:06:19.970> of<00:06:20.330> course<00:06:20.600> it's

00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:20.780 
could do with it I think of course it's

00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:22.480 
could do with it I think of course it's
like<00:06:20.900> a<00:06:20.960> third<00:06:21.200> person<00:06:21.440> view<00:06:21.830> maybe<00:06:22.010> you<00:06:22.250> want

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:22.490 
like a third person view maybe you want

00:06:22.490 --> 00:06:24.040 
like a third person view maybe you want
to<00:06:22.670> be<00:06:22.820> able<00:06:22.910> to<00:06:23.090> switch<00:06:23.390> to<00:06:23.600> a<00:06:23.630> first-person

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:24.050 
to be able to switch to a first-person

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:26.500 
to be able to switch to a first-person
view<00:06:24.260> maybe<00:06:25.040> you<00:06:25.190> can<00:06:25.310> be<00:06:25.490> able<00:06:25.700> as<00:06:25.850> first<00:06:26.390> vice

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:26.510 
view maybe you can be able as first vice

00:06:26.510 --> 00:06:29.320 
view maybe you can be able as first vice
versa<00:06:27.050> like<00:06:27.770> there's<00:06:28.070> an<00:06:28.190> actual<00:06:28.370> mode<00:06:28.970> word

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:29.330 
versa like there's an actual mode word

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:31.360 
versa like there's an actual mode word
is<00:06:29.600> first<00:06:29.870> person<00:06:30.260> and<00:06:30.500> there's<00:06:31.040> just<00:06:31.130> so<00:06:31.280> much

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:31.370 
is first person and there's just so much

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:33.130 
is first person and there's just so much
they<00:06:31.520> could<00:06:31.640> do<00:06:31.820> with<00:06:31.970> it<00:06:32.150> and<00:06:32.330> they<00:06:32.780> didn't<00:06:33.050> do

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:33.140 
they could do with it and they didn't do

00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:34.870 
they could do with it and they didn't do
