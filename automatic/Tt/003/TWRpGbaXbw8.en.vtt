00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:07.900
 the team takes df to Dr. liu's office so they are new to 

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:11.540
 california for pre-surgical exams or the alleged alien implant 

00:00:14.179 --> 00:00:19.140
 both sought radiativity electromagnetic fields in such things 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.499
 let's go inter 

00:00:20.499 --> 00:00:21.869
 let's go 

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.710
 jeff robinov gave a magnetic object to his leg four years ago 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:30.220
 When I got back, I wanted to know what it was. 

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:33.100
 was with veterans association physicians 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.100
 they told the samba basket just do not worry it's nothing 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.409
 for some reason I thought 

00:00:39.409 --> 00:00:40.830
 and if it's metal 

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:45.210
 There he put a sister on it. He jumped up. I thought it good with this study. 

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.880
 based magnetic 

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.620
 already forward 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.860
 only after the surgical removal the team can determine 

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:54.870
 scientifically that the object is and what its origin 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.420
 this is the main face 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.580
 and here is the object 

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:06.800
 the object appears to be a little bullet slightly larger than a feast cartridge 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:11.170
 buried three or four millimeters of skin from which the whole right 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:12.250
 lands 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:14.409
 paulinho's size is very 

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:18.620
 the very similar to what we have seen before was very similar 

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:22.090
 which is said to have no idea how the object entered his leg 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.850
 he does not remember any incident that may have led him to 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.490
 lodge in your body 

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:31.260
 on a scar near the tie 

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:35.190
 the others he removed were so close to the beam 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.690
 Malu are usually closer 

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:42.120
 the subject but it could be more in the background and create moving towards the 

00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:45.120
 surface 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.909
 chance to do the surgery to remove an implant we have to determine 

00:01:49.909 --> 00:01:51.580
 that the object was 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:55.940
 we have to do some tests and magnetism and this radio frequency 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:00.620
 is a brother with strength of 113 pounds with him we can get a good 

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.480
 magnetic force 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:08.770
 the object reacted magnetic field it should be pulled closer to the 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:10.239
 Earth 

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:13.239
 is this the cut-off point 

00:02:13.909 --> 00:02:17.309
 bf to open 

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:20.339
 for this karam as 

00:02:20.339 --> 00:02:22.939
 Well, yes, I see. 

00:02:22.939 --> 00:02:27.700
 was using a small secular area for that very reason as for the sixth percent 

00:02:28.969 --> 00:02:31.969
 to announcement three millimeters three minutes 

00:02:32.669 --> 00:02:36.999
 now let's do radioactivity tests electromagnetic fields 

00:02:36.999 --> 00:02:43.170
 and also radio frequency tests before removing oyster implant 

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:47.819
 we have to overcome something detectable occurring knowing that it is magnetic 

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:51.619
 maybe have activity maybe in radio rooms 

00:02:51.619 --> 00:02:56.779
 we have to finish the metal piece session or if it has a higher purpose dr 

00:02:56.779 --> 00:03:01.009
 this is a carousel and subway serve to detect electromagnetic fields 

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:05.769
 Let's see what happened. 

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:07.629
 this is the leader 

00:03:07.629 --> 00:03:10.979
 of a very strong magnetic field 

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:14.479
 this mark on the unmeasured wash is extremely strong 

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:22.279
 it is very common for a small piece of metal to emit such a strong signal 

00:03:22.279 --> 00:03:25.279
 that is connected to a power source 

00:03:25.999 --> 00:03:30.260
 I'm more curious now that you've read the issue 

00:03:31.299 --> 00:03:35.919
 with increase projections to be used is a radio frequency detector 

00:03:35.919 --> 00:03:42.389
 we have two parts to check the biggest of spending feet and the other reduction 

00:03:42.389 --> 00:03:48.290
 denied the doctor to triumph over a wide range of possible radiofrequencies 

00:03:48.289 --> 00:03:52.129
 from the beginning of the band of those who win up a little from the band of giants 

00:03:53.559 --> 00:03:57.479
 one month before is the fulfillment of one of the students by television and 

00:03:57.479 --> 00:03:59.059
 FM radio 

00:03:59.059 --> 00:04:03.629
 arrives to receive much louder used by microwave ovens and telephones 

00:04:03.629 --> 00:04:06.869
 between other devices 

00:04:06.869 --> 00:04:09.519
 This is clear radio frequency. 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:15.450
 appears to be 5 9 comma with 2 5 2 and 5 4 gigs 

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:25.050
 now let's see how often we deny them the guideline five comma 8 9 3 

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:26.699
 deny these 

00:04:26.699 --> 00:04:31.669
 the reading to deny these fell in the pedestrian band the band should be used to 

00:04:31.669 --> 00:04:35.490
 satellite and terrestrial radio communications by both the government and 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:37.129
 by consumers 

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:41.509
 I already discovered something today and now we'll wait until tomorrow to 

00:04:41.509 --> 00:04:44.509
 see result 

00:04:46.469 --> 00:04:50.560
 is evidence we can examine was very interesting indeed 

00:04:50.559 --> 00:04:55.080
 we had a read off of those that look good on a radio frequency of 

00:04:55.079 --> 00:05:00.099
 item has 5 megahertz issing 49 gigahertz 35 megahertz which 

00:05:03.680 --> 00:05:07.430
 there is a chance of having captured the background radiation around files 

00:05:08.019 --> 00:05:12.459
 the other is 59 reaches 59 giants so this is a frequency 

00:05:12.459 --> 00:05:18.139
 radio frequency that astronomers use to detect 

00:05:18.139 --> 00:05:23.009
 emissions from outer space because it is an object on the skin of 

00:05:23.009 --> 00:05:27.299
 someone would generate such a kind of frequency first thing to send 

00:05:27.299 --> 00:05:30.419
 a sign of a frequency that travels very far 

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:36.240
 and it is also a type of digital signal week these victories are 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.120
 particularly serious 

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:42.860
 powerful in magnitude is so can be particularly in the space where it was 

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:45.370
 made the measurement now 

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:47.479
 basically this was conclusive 

00:05:47.479 --> 00:05:50.479
 while we do not remove the implant is to do more tests 

00:05:54.159 --> 00:05:57.559
 after seeing if the surgical site the systems are ready to room 

00:05:57.559 --> 00:06:00.559
 is ready and I am anxious to see what we are going to distract 

00:06:02.039 --> 00:06:06.180
 before the operation the medical team drew blood for the object 

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:09.180
 even the fluid in which it has been immersed can be stored 

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:12.440
 certain it's ready 

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:15.440
 of the team must 

00:06:16.749 --> 00:06:21.270
 in fact I will have to go back a little to find this thing there 

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:25.810
 the doctor of a crisis announced today 11 in the capital are new in california that 

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:28.349
 will conduct the operation 

00:06:28.349 --> 00:06:31.349
 there the defendant was ethical 

00:06:32.089 --> 00:06:34.089
 I'm going to use local anesthesia. 

00:06:34.089 --> 00:06:37.509
 Let's have here at this meeting before 

00:06:37.509 --> 00:06:38.740
 I spoke 

00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:41.740
 a small cut on the skin 

00:06:46.479 --> 00:06:49.460
 I can not feel the goal relying on the x-ray 

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:51.550
 Let's go back a little. 

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:54.550
 I think we started to see something here. 

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:59.149
 the company generates a black dot there 

00:06:59.149 --> 00:07:01.779
 I'll make sure we're at the same point. 

00:07:01.779 --> 00:07:04.099
 It seems that you now take care of yourself 

00:07:04.099 --> 00:07:05.689
 for these cases 

00:07:05.689 --> 00:07:08.289
 You're fighting with force. 

00:07:08.289 --> 00:07:11.289
 show slide 

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:17.090
 I picked tavares had solid for sure the doctor being left standing 

00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:21.460
 surprised to see that the steering cloth had adhered to the objective 

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:25.130
 it seems that the object was encapsulated in organic material that was it 

00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:26.409
 saved the body of the day 

00:07:26.409 --> 00:07:29.409
 you had to pull a little to be able to remove 

00:07:33.439 --> 00:07:36.439
 if the bidder 

00:07:38.289 --> 00:07:41.520
 with the size of the object was surprising 

00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:42.930
 it was more 

00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:45.719
 he looked more boring and round 

00:07:45.719 --> 00:07:49.849
 I was really surprised that something of this size is a signal 

00:07:50.699 --> 00:07:53.699
 out of my body we're already out 

00:07:55.509 --> 00:07:58.419
 I'm curious to see what happens like everyone 

00:07:58.419 --> 00:08:03.039
 now that you left that will change the next step will be to take the material to the 

00:08:03.039 --> 00:08:06.039
 laboratory and start examining 

00:08:09.759 --> 00:08:13.029
 when the team analyzes the implant 

00:08:13.029 --> 00:08:16.069
 they discover something that nobody expected 

00:08:16.069 --> 00:08:17.329
 to make a small meteorite
