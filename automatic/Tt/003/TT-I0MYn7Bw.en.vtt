00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:33.790 
water straightening I know this is

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:35.250 
water straightening I know this is
common<00:02:34.120> sense<00:02:34.150> but<00:02:34.480> I'm<00:02:34.630> just<00:02:34.840> pointing<00:02:35.050> this

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
common sense but I'm just pointing this

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:41.869 
common sense but I'm just pointing this
out<00:02:35.470> here's<00:02:35.980> a<00:02:36.069> few<00:02:36.250> examples

00:02:41.869 --> 00:02:41.879 

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:46.069 

look<00:02:42.420> at<00:02:42.629> how<00:02:42.810> I'm<00:02:42.989> barely<00:02:43.319> leading<00:02:45.079> that's

look at how I'm barely leading that's

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:48.259 
look at how I'm barely leading that's
also<00:02:47.040> a<00:02:47.069> reason<00:02:47.519> why<00:02:47.700> you<00:02:47.760> don't<00:02:48.060> want<00:02:48.209> to

00:02:48.259 --> 00:02:48.269 
also a reason why you don't want to

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:50.330 
also a reason why you don't want to
shoot<00:02:48.480> like<00:02:48.689> that<00:02:48.719> it's<00:02:49.139> just<00:02:49.409> so<00:02:49.709> easy<00:02:49.739> for

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.340 
shoot like that it's just so easy for

to the place you were before so you'll

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.890 
to the place you were before so you'll

straight because you're just retro blip

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:11.989 
straight because you're just retro blip
in<00:03:10.469> this<00:03:10.620> space<00:03:10.950> that<00:03:10.980> you<00:03:11.400> was<00:03:11.549> important

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:11.999 
in this space that you was important

00:03:11.999 --> 00:03:12.650

game

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
game

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.720 
game
look<00:03:13.140> at<00:03:13.290> how<00:03:13.380> he<00:03:13.440> stepped<00:03:13.950> back<00:03:14.190> a<00:03:14.220> little<00:03:14.520> bit

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
look at how he stepped back a little bit

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.970 
look at how he stepped back a little bit
and<00:03:15.060> that's<00:03:15.390> why<00:03:15.600> he<00:03:16.080> got<00:03:16.200> hit<00:03:16.380> right<00:03:16.500> there<00:03:16.560> I

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:16.980 
and that's why he got hit right there I

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.950 
and that's why he got hit right there I
think<00:03:17.640> this<00:03:17.790> is<00:03:17.970> why<00:03:18.150> Ducks<00:03:18.690> this<00:03:20.060> okay<00:03:21.060> we're

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:21.960 
think this is why Ducks this okay we're

pretty good he's a USA service and
here's<00:03:27.240> some<00:03:27.420> examples<00:03:27.930> of<00:03:28.020> shooting<00:03:28.350> the

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
here's some examples of shooting the

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.580 
here's some examples of shooting the
mill<00:03:29.420> now<00:03:30.420> I'm<00:03:30.600> going<00:03:30.840> to<00:03:30.930> demonstrate<00:03:31.080> some

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:31.590 
mill now I'm going to demonstrate some

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:35.150 
mill now I'm going to demonstrate some
sniper<00:03:32.310> shooting<00:03:33.620> look<00:03:34.620> at<00:03:34.740> how<00:03:34.890> I'm<00:03:34.950> moving

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.160 
sniper shooting look at how I'm moving

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:37.010 
sniper shooting look at how I'm moving
in<00:03:35.430> the<00:03:35.520> same<00:03:35.730> way<00:03:35.940> they<00:03:36.150> are<00:03:36.180> like<00:03:36.600> whoops<00:03:36.870> at

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:37.020 
in the same way they are like whoops at

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:40.460 
in the same way they are like whoops at
system<00:03:37.410> I<00:03:37.560> just<00:03:37.590> find<00:03:37.980> it<00:03:38.160> a<00:03:38.220> lot<00:03:38.430> easier<00:03:39.470> and

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:40.470 
system I just find it a lot easier and

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:42.830 
system I just find it a lot easier and
also<00:03:41.220> you<00:03:41.340> just<00:03:41.520> have<00:03:41.670> to<00:03:41.790> first<00:03:42.180> find<00:03:42.480> leaves

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
also you just have to first find leaves

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.200 
also you just have to first find leaves
and<00:03:43.200> stuff<00:03:43.580> and<00:03:44.580> scope<00:03:45.000> the<00:03:45.210> tags<00:03:45.510> are<00:03:45.930> very

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:47.210 
and stuff and scope the tags are very

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:49.670 
and stuff and scope the tags are very
accurate<00:03:48.210> they're<00:03:48.810> more<00:03:48.990> accurate<00:03:49.170> than<00:03:49.470> no

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:49.680 
accurate they're more accurate than no

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.280 
accurate they're more accurate than no
scopes<00:03:50.040> and<00:03:50.360> I'm<00:03:51.360> sure<00:03:51.600> most<00:03:51.810> of<00:03:51.990> you<00:03:52.110> know

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.290 
scopes and I'm sure most of you know

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.650 
scopes and I'm sure most of you know
that<00:03:52.670> but<00:03:53.670> it's<00:03:53.820> moving<00:03:54.000> the<00:03:54.270> same<00:03:54.510> way

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:54.660 
that but it's moving the same way

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:57.410 
that but it's moving the same way
they're<00:03:54.960> moving<00:03:55.610> and<00:03:56.610> I<00:03:56.760> find<00:03:57.060> this<00:03:57.180> extremely

00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.420 
they're moving and I find this extremely

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.800 
they're moving and I find this extremely
easy<00:03:58.050> for<00:03:58.410> beginners<00:03:58.530> and<00:03:59.100> me<00:03:59.280> so<00:03:59.790> it's<00:04:00.060> a<00:04:00.150> all

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:00.810 
easy for beginners and me so it's a all

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:02.660 
easy for beginners and me so it's a all
right<00:04:00.960> the<00:04:01.140> same<00:04:01.410> can<00:04:01.680> be<00:04:01.710> applied<00:04:02.250> to<00:04:02.280> other

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:02.670 
right the same can be applied to other

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:04.880 
right the same can be applied to other
weapons<00:04:02.970> like<00:04:03.360> the<00:04:03.480> shotgun<00:04:03.750> you<00:04:04.590> see<00:04:04.740> how<00:04:04.830> he

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:04.890 
weapons like the shotgun you see how he

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:06.410 
weapons like the shotgun you see how he
has<00:04:05.070> an<00:04:05.220> over<00:04:05.520> shield<00:04:05.790> but<00:04:06.060> it's<00:04:06.210> just

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:06.420 
has an over shield but it's just

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.360 
has an over shield but it's just
dominated<00:04:07.080> cuz<00:04:07.230> I<00:04:07.320> entered<00:04:07.710> three<00:04:08.130> whole

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
dominated cuz I entered three whole

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:13.040 
dominated cuz I entered three whole
clips<00:04:08.730> in<00:04:09.000> his<00:04:09.300> nutsack<00:04:10.190> and<00:04:11.810> with<00:04:12.810> the

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:13.050 
clips in his nutsack and with the

00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:15.590 
clips in his nutsack and with the
sniping<00:04:13.740> and<00:04:13.980> those<00:04:14.370> scopes<00:04:14.670> become<00:04:15.270> a<00:04:15.300> lot

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:15.600 
sniping and those scopes become a lot

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.420 
sniping and those scopes become a lot
easier<00:04:15.810> just<00:04:16.110> look<00:04:16.830> at<00:04:16.980> how<00:04:17.100> I'm<00:04:17.160> moving

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
easier just look at how I'm moving

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.690 
easier just look at how I'm moving
toward<00:04:18.000> his<00:04:18.360> fingers<00:04:19.220> notice<00:04:20.220> how<00:04:20.400> I<00:04:20.430> was

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:20.700 
toward his fingers notice how I was

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:23.720 
toward his fingers notice how I was
moving<00:04:20.970> right<00:04:21.390> but<00:04:22.020> then<00:04:22.230> when<00:04:22.710> he<00:04:22.740> moved<00:04:22.920> left

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:23.730 
moving right but then when he moved left

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:26.770 
moving right but then when he moved left
I<00:04:23.930> immediately<00:04:24.930> changed<00:04:25.620> my<00:04:25.710> direction<00:04:25.890> and

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780 
I immediately changed my direction and

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:29.360 
I immediately changed my direction and
just<00:04:27.780> shot<00:04:28.350> him<00:04:28.500> and<00:04:28.770> it<00:04:28.890> was<00:04:28.980> pretty<00:04:29.190> accurate

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 
just shot him and it was pretty accurate

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:36.980 
just shot him and it was pretty accurate
too<00:04:34.370> now<00:04:35.370> I<00:04:35.400> miss<00:04:35.880> these<00:04:36.120> can<00:04:36.420> be<00:04:36.630> hitting

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990 
too now I miss these can be hitting

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:40.820
