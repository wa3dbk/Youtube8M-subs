00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:14.940
 so hi everyone today we get 

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.410
 found for a server presentation 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:17.960
 the server 10 pixels 

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:21.180
 so of course I would put you lippÃ© 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:23.939
 in the description so here you can 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:27.480
 see one's direct attack you can 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:29.699
 see the menu so you have the place where 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.980
 you go and spawn and so you have a 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:37.890
 book to say welcome and so on 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:42.629
 sense then we have a watch to do 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:44.010
 human rights in fact a 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:46.950
 right click or a little wait until 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:47.850
 his charge and the people are going 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:52.170
 reappear 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:54.989
 no no so here otherwise in this server 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:57.059
 there are really several games 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:58.980
 are really awesome a little more varied 

00:00:57.059 --> 00:01:02.219
 than other servers finally at least 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.619
 I've never found the same games on 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.720
 other servers finally in particular 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:08.820
 one that I make you see so click 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.210
 right without the compass so here this is the 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.340
 spawn here you have the adventure lobby 

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.200
 so never done but I think and 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:18.049
 adventure maps so I think it can be 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:22.380
 friendly 

00:01:18.049 --> 00:01:26.189
 so here we have the 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.890
 paintball without paintball a little 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.560
 emerald appears 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:30.920
 right click and that's sort of the 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.659
 shock 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:36.140
 so how to buy you click 

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:37.640
 on it and you can see that right 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.460
 in my screen there is a small counter 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.630
 so the money I have and the names of 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.810
 so I made a few more achievement 

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:48.320
 two more kills the more you earn from 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:50.150
 the more money you will have money 

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.619
 to pay small options a few 

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:53.360
 centers is so there you have them 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:54.920
 panels of which enjoys so you can 

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:58.130
 so there always parties it's 

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:59.479
 always we could never finally find 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.060
 there are always parts it's 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:04.330
 really that's great I think 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:09.679
 then you have the pvp 

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:11.900
 so it's a pvp with the chests it's 

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:12.590
 so you know you are looking for that 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.390
 coffers 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.700
 you can not break the wood and that's 

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:18.560
 so again the same principle on 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.500
 signs there are always parts 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.300
 free and here too a show so 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:26.450
 always right the a little counter 

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:28.489
 so the number of kills with the parties 

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:32.660
 that I have won good for now I 

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:35.680
 earn more then you have the heck the 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.680
 quad kraft end 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:41.550
 so here no there is no shock by 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:44.040
 against so the quack crack for those 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:45.319
 who would ask are you wait 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.300
 to see quickly 

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:51.989
 that's it if you have a bow and you shoot 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:54.060
 between you pull on the floor so that 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:55.019
 nobody finally to bring down the 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.670
 people must be the last 

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:57.930
 here we are and to leave a party 

00:02:56.670 --> 00:03:02.160
 so that's for all modes you 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:03.930
 do slash lobby hop there and you 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.550
 So leave this is for everything 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:08.069
 any server is a simple object you 

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:10.440
 leave each time so then 

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:11.730
 we continue the visit so I also 

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:15.810
 present this server because I'm going 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:17.970
 to be quite a few times on server on my 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:19.319
 chain so if you can subscribe 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:24.390
 like that you'll see a lot of 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:26.400
 parts of my case so that's after 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:30.540
 so we will continue for my little help 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:34.200
 of turkey and the 0 1 so that 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:37.349
 completely awesome part it's in 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.569
 somehow you leave you are there 

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:41.819
 four teams 

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:43.769
 you arrive on a four teams and 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:45.959
 you each have the same map 

00:03:43.769 --> 00:03:46.980
 but each team finds itself under a 

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:48.720
 mark somehow 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:51.450
 finally I'll show you soon 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:54.390
 it 'll be easier 

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:59.040
 imagine harwanne voices you wait 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:04:00.959
 there look at the brand Valais loaded you 

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.159
 see there mores that separates us and 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:04.409
 for 15 minutes we see this rise 

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:06.269
 donates so that so there are some 

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:09.689
 chests and after 15 minutes his 

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:11.489
 walls will fall and we will have to kill 

00:04:09.689 --> 00:04:13.980
 the other teams be the first so 

00:04:11.489 --> 00:04:15.060
 look here this is exactly the 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:20.009
 same identical bases 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:21.810
 so that's enough excuse me that enough 

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:23.940
 awesome really me frankly we know 

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:26.130
 it's my favorite of waiters and 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:29.310
 moreover it is most of the time 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:32.160
 I stay five on this game I 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:33.240
 do not hurt with sheep company you 

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.380
 will soon be able to see them 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:37.680
 so in fact all that I you 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:39.220
 present a little bit that's it's all 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:41.590
 will happen without my channel 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:44.340
 I will give a demonstration here 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:49.030
 so always his side the kills 

00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:50.320
 or the games won and not geo 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:55.900
 still the shock 

00:04:50.320 --> 00:05:01.090
 here and finally tarnished by the cost of 

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:03.370
 Kraft also earlier for sure and therefore 

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:06.490
 here you also have the shop 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:10.780
 so if it's a bit strange it's a 

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:14.140
 so you have like a hoe and finally 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:18.160
 I do not know what's called down 

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:21.520
 have concerns and take you as 

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:23.620
 rockets you have to touch people this juice 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:25.980
 bosses finally I did just a part 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:28.570
 you can see his side being is he 

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:32.080
 it's nice but it's because 

00:05:28.570 --> 00:05:35.680
 I prefer so that's so yes if we 

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:37.350
 fall to the spawn and that's it I want more 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:45.430
 see nobody 

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:48.880
 but here you go, that's okay 

00:05:45.430 --> 00:05:50.440
 do the little trick of this server that is 

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:51.790
 really great especially the zoos 

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:55.300
 frankly I really advise you 

00:05:51.790 --> 00:05:57.820
 the bones and so all and most of these 

00:05:55.300 --> 00:06:00.700
 games so pvp shells suck the zoos 

00:05:57.820 --> 00:06:04.150
 are going to happen on my channel I'm going 

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:05.070
 soon turn with little economical role or 

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:07.419
 sometimes alone 

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:08.950
 so here I tell you to the approached 

00:06:07.419 --> 00:06:11.110
 it was the small presentation of 

00:06:08.950 --> 00:06:13.210
 server 10 pixels so show you the 

00:06:11.110 --> 00:06:16.300
 link in the island in the island in the 

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:20.250
 description you the price is good bah I 

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:20.250
 tell you more to the approached hi
