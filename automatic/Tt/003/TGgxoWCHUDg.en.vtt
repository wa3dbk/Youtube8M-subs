 arisen is such a tree is burning look 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:09.570
 that's what they call the belief I have that 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:10.800
 more often with other youtube 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.330

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.400
 that try even once 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:16.379
 Patrice is honestly the only one 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.940
 brand in this with me in the 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.859

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:23.070

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:24.510
 I also own the brand suits me 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.680
 my attitude base was missing 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.240
 and one case was that I have now 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.859
 Still worried but everything else I had 

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.539
 really already at home and to the products 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.830
 I like to use all the great and 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:33.600
 that's why i have the all marx then 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.219
 dig up a gap 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.489
 tastes and I wish you much 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:37.489
 fun 

00:00:40.329 --> 00:00:44.839
 there are many products at a glance 

00:00:42.859 --> 00:00:46.370
 You can already know that because both 

00:00:44.839 --> 00:00:47.750
 him and me constantly in the 

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:49.640
 Keep the camera and the to ours 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.409
 absolute favorites belong first 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.479
 I called the little fine tuxedo 

00:00:51.409 --> 00:00:55.399
 one applied this is the palmer im 

00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:57.489
 kathrin's assortment of probably fuller 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:59.359
 Silicones because the skin immediately great 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:01.489
 looks soft and totally 

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:03.229
 even though it works for it 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:04.549
 also had really really good so 

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:06.229
 very nice skin picture if you give it 

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:07.729
 has applied and I have the feeling 

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:09.170
 he still makes the makeup a bit longer 

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:10.880
 durable and then I have 

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:13.130
 foundation uses this is the allnet 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.090
 Kathrin does not know the class foundation 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.649
 how many times for those already 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:17.690
 That's really true 

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:19.880
 i the best kind kickin the best 

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:21.440
 drugstore foundation that leaves is a 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:22.880
 look so healthy and fresh and 

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.440
 really not cold or at all 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.209
 The covering power I would get pasted 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.709
 to classify as low to medium 

00:01:26.209 --> 00:01:30.110
 but it can be very beautiful layers 

00:01:27.709 --> 00:01:32.060
 the color selection is okay the color 010 

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:32.929
 Leitgeb always suits me quite well except 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:33.560
 when I'm just out of vacation 

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:36.259
 come 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:38.149
 which corresponds to approximately McCann g20 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:40.039
 So driving technically would have the earlier 

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:41.539
 Most of you will fit then we come 

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:43.399
 to concealer by simply dead on 

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:45.289
 islam of katrins I used had the 

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:46.969
 in color 0 1 0 1 draw the 

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:48.530
 bright color and I have a lot 

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:50.240
 Very often talked about as I like 

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.590
 They like to be easy under the eyes 

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.689
 around the nose and on the chin 

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.250
 because with camouflage very very creamy 

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:56.750
 and certainly not for many 

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:58.369
 the right under my eyes I come 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.810
 that's very good, but also easy 

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:01.700
 just because I like a high opacity 

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.109
 In the eyes then we come to 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:05.179
 Eye make-up I have as the first in 

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:06.859
 the base applied that is the prime 

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:08.090
 accounts for only base I have my 

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:09.739
 for the video new purchase and 

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:12.019
 Accordingly, there for the first time 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:13.850
 tested a light pink now 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:15.200
 Stifling color and eye shadow come 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:17.030
 really good on the world and 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.370
 Shelf life, I find it okay too 

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:20.600
 It's a solid one in any case 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.319
 I have the mobile lid for the 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.480
 color 750 million 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:26.939
 Brown decided that is such a very 

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:28.769
 warm copper brown with a very very 

00:02:26.939 --> 00:02:30.480
 nice sorry schirmer generally find 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:31.680
 i really like the individual types of katrins 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:33.359
 they have been very nice 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:35.099
 color selection and those are from the texture 

00:02:33.359 --> 00:02:36.749
 Here's really really good in the lid fold 

00:02:35.099 --> 00:02:39.480
 I then have the color my first couple 

00:02:36.749 --> 00:02:40.620
 Part number 400 is applied 

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.810
 the color will always be a bit like 

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.459
 the option mcfit top acted and it 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.109
 is really a very beautiful brown 

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:48.180
 sound with the one over the eyelet fold 

00:02:46.109 --> 00:02:49.889
 can emphasize a bit cooler than new 

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.989
 and brown and in combination are the 

00:02:49.889 --> 00:02:53.969
 Both super nice as a broker of course 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:55.439
 the glamor dojo mascara that is the 

00:02:53.969 --> 00:02:56.939
 There are also classic variants 

00:02:55.439 --> 00:02:58.200
 still stuck in the water and then still in 

00:02:56.939 --> 00:02:59.489
 a leader in packaging the 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.049
 I find black best with distance 

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:02.699
 we've heard about this so often 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:04.799
 Talking about massacre separates the eyelashes 

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:07.199
 very nice gives volume is great 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:08.969
 black and I can only do that for you all 

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:10.949
 to the heart for the eyebrows 

00:03:08.969 --> 00:03:13.049
 i also taken a classic that is 

00:03:10.949 --> 00:03:15.000
 ipad by patrice i always use only 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:16.829
 the lighter color and strangely 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.599
 breaks me the darker color always 

00:03:16.829 --> 00:03:20.129
 That's why I have five 

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:21.629
 open eyebrows even of 

00:03:20.129 --> 00:03:23.159
 patrice and each looks like that 

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:25.109
 what you saw so totally off 

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:26.370
 crawled as I said the lighter color 

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:28.169
 and I wear it with an eyeliner 

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.790
 Brush on the always varies with 

00:03:28.169 --> 00:03:32.489
 wherein the discovery that it has a 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:33.359
 that's the color 000 people from the 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:35.340
 respective industry 

00:03:33.359 --> 00:03:38.040
 that's really loud orange 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.509
 Ancient very very silky texture bled 

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.040
 unfortunately a bit stain on the order 

00:03:39.509 --> 00:03:42.689
 So you have to blend in well and 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.280
 Careful to wear but the color is 

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:45.659
 super nice and I'm wearing that right 

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:46.859
 Often lately then I have 

00:03:45.659 --> 00:03:47.970
 also a highlighter 

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:50.579
 used that is the illumination 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:51.840
 highlighter penn in this rosÃ© golden 

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:53.400
 I've got that color too 

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.259
 I am honestly not shown 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.210
 Highlighters are mainly liquid 

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:58.680
 Highlighter I find difficult when 

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:00.330
 I always find the flush with it 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.680
 bit back and forth just push it 

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:03.570
 with my fingers above the 

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:05.490
 cheekbones trumped her now 

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:06.750
 not the easiest product 

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:08.670
 I think and then still remain 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.470
 thereby combining two products 

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:13.320
 and once the license color 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:14.670
 league when in color 060 flamingo 

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:16.170
 and so on 

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:19.200
 I still have to intensify that 

00:04:16.170 --> 00:04:21.360
 ultimate safestick in color 080 

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:23.460
 passion bed applied and that's on 

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:25.200
 the finished looks adds up to something 

00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:26.910
 the total cost so the dazzling I 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:29.040
 get in here and it really is 

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:31.020
 mainly favorites and products the 

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:32.430

 maybe I'll try it 

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:42.000
 another brand on product together 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:43.260
 to look for and thus a look too 

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.730
