00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:16.740 
first offense well pad I think in this

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
prosecutor has to take that into account

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.740 
prosecutor has to take that into account
just<00:00:23.250> listen<00:00:23.580> to<00:00:23.640> her<00:00:23.760> on<00:00:23.820> the<00:00:23.939> tape<00:00:24.210> and<00:00:24.689> you

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
just listen to her on the tape and you

just like 18 or 19 year olds the law has

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.380 
just like 18 or 19 year olds the law has
made<00:00:58.590> a<00:00:58.620> line<00:00:59.340> in<00:00:59.489> the<00:00:59.579> sand<00:00:59.789> saying<00:01:00.149> that<00:01:00.300> if

well we'll talk about that a little

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.730 
well we'll talk about that a little
later<00:01:12.479> a<00:01:12.630> lot<00:01:12.840> of<00:01:12.960> people<00:01:13.170> in<00:01:13.229> choice<00:01:13.439> or<00:01:13.650> is<00:01:13.710> a

later a lot of people in choice or is a

later a lot of people in choice or is a
former<00:01:14.100> detective<00:01:14.570> do<00:01:15.570> you<00:01:15.720> find<00:01:16.020> that<00:01:16.259> there

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
former detective do you find that there

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.830 
former detective do you find that there
is<00:01:16.740> a<00:01:16.770> common<00:01:17.250> theme<00:01:17.490> amongst<00:01:18.000> these<00:01:18.360> kinds<00:01:18.780> of

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
is a common theme amongst these kinds of

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.109 
is a common theme amongst these kinds of
cases<00:01:19.049> where<00:01:19.290> there<00:01:19.590> is<00:01:19.770> substance<00:01:20.640> abuse

cases where there is substance abuse

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:24.770 
cases where there is substance abuse
involved<00:01:22.640> not<00:01:23.640> necessarily<00:01:24.180> I<00:01:24.360> think<00:01:24.600> that<00:01:24.750> a

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
involved not necessarily I think that a

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.719 
involved not necessarily I think that a
sexual<00:01:25.409> addiction<00:01:25.799> is<00:01:26.159> probably<00:01:26.430> the<00:01:26.580> more

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:26.729 
sexual addiction is probably the more

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.240 
sexual addiction is probably the more
kind<00:01:26.970> game<00:01:27.330> and<00:01:27.630> I<00:01:27.750> take<00:01:28.320> difference<00:01:28.829> with

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
kind game and I take difference with

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.310 
kind game and I take difference with
your<00:01:29.909> other<00:01:30.030> guests<00:01:30.450> who<00:01:30.509> are<00:01:30.540> stating<00:01:31.170> that

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:33.509 
these psychological problems may be a

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.200 
these psychological problems may be a
factor<00:01:34.140> in<00:01:34.200> mitigation<00:01:34.619> if<00:01:35.040> this<00:01:35.520> was<00:01:35.729> a<00:01:35.759> man
