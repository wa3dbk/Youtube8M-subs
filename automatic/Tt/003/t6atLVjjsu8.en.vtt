is<00:01:37.460> definitely<00:01:37.760> in<00:01:38.270> the<00:01:38.390> style<00:01:38.720> of<00:01:39.020> what's<00:01:39.380> on

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:39.680 
is definitely in the style of what's on

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.920 
is definitely in the style of what's on
my<00:01:39.920> ipod<00:01:40.070> so<00:01:40.670> if<00:01:40.909> you<00:01:41.119> had<00:01:41.270> to<00:01:41.360> name<00:01:41.390> one<00:01:41.720> song

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:41.930

my ipod so if you had to name one song
on<00:01:42.049> your<00:01:42.170> iPod<00:01:42.530> though<00:01:42.650> that<00:01:42.799> just<00:01:42.979> sums<00:01:43.280> you

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:43.460 
on your iPod though that just sums you

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.940 
on your iPod though that just sums you
up<00:01:43.520> like<00:01:43.850> your<00:01:44.330> song<00:01:44.750> what<00:01:45.380> would<00:01:45.470> it<00:01:45.500> be<00:01:45.590> I

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:45.950
