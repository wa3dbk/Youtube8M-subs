a beginner it's just a lot of different

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.600 
a beginner it's just a lot of different
things<00:02:00.299> going<00:02:00.450> on<00:02:00.719> um<00:02:01.619> in<00:02:01.950> terms<00:02:02.130> of<00:02:02.280> chords

things going on um in terms of chords
but<00:02:03.329> um<00:02:03.570> yeah<00:02:03.990> so<00:02:04.170> I<00:02:04.259> started<00:02:04.320> really<00:02:04.890> small

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
but um yeah so I started really small

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:08.690 
but um yeah so I started really small
just<00:02:05.340> with<00:02:05.490> four<00:02:05.820> you<00:02:06.540> know<00:02:06.659> chord<00:02:07.670> 4<00:02:08.670> chord

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
just with four you know chord 4 chord

just with four you know chord 4 chord
chord<00:02:09.179> progressions<00:02:09.780> so<00:02:09.959> I<00:02:10.410> did<00:02:10.679> that<00:02:10.830> one

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
chord progressions so I did that one

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:11.990 
chord progressions so I did that one
another<00:02:11.370> one<00:02:11.520> was<00:02:11.640> Americ

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:11.320 
tricky so you might have to learn a

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:12.870 
tricky so you might have to learn a
couple<00:05:11.410> songs<00:05:11.740> before<00:05:11.979> you<00:05:12.190> learn<00:05:12.340> that<00:05:12.460> one<00:05:12.639> I
