00:00:01.219 --> 00:00:04.370
 one woman a day 

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:07.800
 the listing had the turn of ronaldinho gaucho 

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:10.639
 Is he coming back to you? 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:11.959
 player wants 

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:14.669
 Brazil was asking for his presence. 

00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:18.090
 is that reference player you want in the Brazilian national team 

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:24.550
 the players arrived in time to play on Wednesday 31 March against the 

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:26.980
 corinthians that can be decisive of the championship 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:28.390
 I would like you to 

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:30.829
 compared 

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:33.260
 adding up all 

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.260
 No doubt 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.500
 but no issues do not focus on the return of ronaldinho 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.010
 for all that he means by the moment above all that is 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:47.790
 indent 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:48.710
 ever 

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:51.710
 I made clear what I think about it. 

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.180
 lack of players 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:00:58.620
 be more consecrated as a greater thief trajectory 

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.680
 world champion with the Brazilian national team 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.280
 popcorn corn, I think 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:09.280
 after his return to Brazilian football 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.510
 the time has passed to go 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:16.510
 that he could sell again very well 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.350
 tunnels becoming one of the main players of Brazil in the 

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:23.540
 season 

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.259
 He has been playing too often. 

00:01:26.259 --> 00:01:29.770
 since the Carioca championship is what is worse still 

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.110
 showing its growth 

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.200
 the physical 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.290
 the Argentine coach 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:41.290
 had no doubt any kind of questioning 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.080
 it has been constituting a leadership 

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:47.420
 I come here 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.180
 should be a reference 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.660
 one of the references we need to have 

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:55.320
 in the Brazilian national team and so 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.510
 his return I think it can also mean for the selection 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:01.510
 proportionally what you have been able to do in Flemish 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:08.030
 Good morning, the excuse I got back from the return of the players. 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.249
 working with our logistics 

00:02:11.249 --> 00:02:13.409
 exactly in practice 

00:02:13.409 --> 00:02:15.389
 minimize 

00:02:15.389 --> 00:02:18.389
 paying all that was within our reach 

00:02:19.799 --> 00:02:23.909
 knows that eventual injury injury can cause to the clubs nÃ© 

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:26.919
 at certain times it is not possible 

00:02:26.919 --> 00:02:28.109
 as a player 

00:02:28.109 --> 00:02:30.069
 all issues 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:33.269
 but I believe that in return 

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:35.849
 for the round of day 7 

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:39.569
 We'll make it through guilherme's competence. 

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:43.889
 I got all the blues 

00:02:43.889 --> 00:02:47.569
 why the players are here to participate in this round of 

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:49.899
 Brazilian championship on the 7th 

00:02:49.899 --> 00:02:53.279
 also on this subject is the placement of some players by 

00:02:53.279 --> 00:02:54.219
 example of ronaldinho 

00:02:54.219 --> 00:02:57.219
 in the proposal for a regulation 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:02.790
 can not give up 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.790
 throughout the work, 

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:16.699
 we think first and foremost about the Brazilian team 

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:22.980
 I understand something very little time has already commented on this, right? 

00:03:22.979 --> 00:03:26.170
 I saw some questions to the players of the saints, I'm not mistaken. 

00:03:27.479 --> 00:03:31.929
 it is not possible to reconcile all the questions and it seems to me to play 

00:03:31.929 --> 00:03:35.749
 Brazilian team continues to be extremely important that we have 

00:03:35.749 --> 00:03:38.749
 to understand how Brazilians think this is important 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:42.269
 we need to see the front 

00:03:43.369 --> 00:03:46.369
 the Brazilian championship has 38 rounds 

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:48.739
 he will not be 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:52.229
 decided in a round as we know 

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:55.229
 and will not be decided by one or two players 

00:03:55.859 --> 00:03:59.209
 country that is governed by a group of players that has the best team over 

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:01.979
 of these 38 rounds will be the champion 

00:04:01.979 --> 00:04:06.669
 is the selection can not meddle in all these particular issues 

00:04:06.669 --> 00:04:09.689
 we also get to the selection 

00:04:09.689 --> 00:04:12.689
 primarily as a Brazilian team 

00:04:13.189 --> 00:04:18.690
 which seems to me quite possible to have this understanding by separating the issues 

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:22.139
 of each club 

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:23.199
 he would have lied 

00:04:23.199 --> 00:04:27.210
 think of the selection as a whole and it is very important that the 

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:30.650
 every step we have to go through 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:33.669
 there are 2014 in the front we work 

00:04:34.189 --> 00:04:36.849
 just thinking about it 

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:39.680
 all the decisions we make 

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.789
 she has an end point 

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:46.169
 if there are steps that we use, we would go there to get there 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:51.219
 we understand that we are going through an important moment and definitions 

00:04:51.219 --> 00:04:54.219
 so we can really move forward 

00:04:54.969 --> 00:04:56.080
 talks little 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:01.099
 works rather forget minor issues dispensed from the selection 

00:05:01.099 --> 00:05:03.599
 Brazilian too soon 

00:05:03.599 --> 00:05:06.599
 our captain gave a statement in the air in the Copa America 

00:05:07.589 --> 00:05:09.999
 Then the whole of Brazil applauded. 

00:05:09.999 --> 00:05:14.719
 you can not think of names above the shield of the Brazilian national team. 

00:05:14.719 --> 00:05:19.019
 one can also put particular questions of each above the shield 

00:05:19.019 --> 00:05:20.210
 of the Brazilian national team
