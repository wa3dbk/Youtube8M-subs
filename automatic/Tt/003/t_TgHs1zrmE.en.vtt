00:00:00.919 --> 00:00:02.810
 what's up guys 

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:05.700
 What are you talking about? 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:07.780
 Pine 

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:09.859
 grow a lot 

00:00:09.859 --> 00:00:12.129
 always commented 

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:15.129
 but it's not here 

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:19.390
 You can go ahead and you can talk. 

00:00:20.329 --> 00:00:21.519
 in the question and 

00:00:21.519 --> 00:00:24.550
 give a tip is simple the tips fear not wanted 

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:28.960
 as assumed the version of sarney dedication updates 

00:00:29.499 --> 00:00:31.699
 and does everything 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:34.699
 the tuscan ecovia encouraged 

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:38.490
 first because it was on the line 

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:40.170
 Good morning to play 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.800
 so I'm not going to miss your funeral 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.800
 the bank of portugal on tripoli 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.910
 did it go well 

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:51.470
 I recommend things very easily 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:54.470
 iPhone isaltino with a distinctive touch 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.780
 mm is an obvious why you love 

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.330
 so I do not need 

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:05.239
 by the end of the 60's 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:06.720
 he took off 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.910
 no noise 

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:11.410
 So 

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:12.780
 I recommend 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.380
 style of play 

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.290
 but the defensive 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.510
 listen so much that it's obvious why 

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:22.800
 for being harvested however with a flashy 

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:24.420
 hoping you're wrong 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.899
 and no matter what, they do not do this kind of thing I did now 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:30.710
 an extreme fault 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.490
 I did not hear space from this guy. 

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:36.490
 in thesis you doubt 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.480
 you stay 

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:43.480
 and other protests doors 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:45.920
 Taxi timothy 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.920
 game mode 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:49.580
 I recommend the stand 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:50.900
 demolition 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.160
 the municipality but Diogo 

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:55.380
 he has the new 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.530
 You can wait for a little date. 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.820
 he is a bed box and yes a little this month 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.820
 the secretaries and with extreme is that the recital 

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:08.539
 - they commented 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:10.580
 What they will do is what the pacha 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.229
 because today is what you will do ahead 

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:16.409
 because as a reviewer of holguín 

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:18.359
 through an excellent bravo 

00:02:18.359 --> 00:02:21.060
 Why am I helping, I'm taking from Tübingen. 

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.359
 there after training the commander 

00:02:23.359 --> 00:02:26.359
 these three things of leandro game and remote control agree 

00:02:27.419 --> 00:02:30.279
 it's a farewell idol thing 

00:02:30.279 --> 00:02:32.099
 as in the 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:33.899
 It's all good, right? 

00:02:33.899 --> 00:02:35.689
 click here 

00:02:35.689 --> 00:02:37.699
 So 

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:40.699
 if you go to a command like pleasure 

00:02:40.699 --> 00:02:42.879
 has a style of play 

00:02:42.879 --> 00:02:45.069
 patrol like me 

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:46.639
 and the boys 

00:02:46.639 --> 00:02:49.469
 Any support but then you have to intervene 

00:02:49.469 --> 00:02:52.079
 that's how the other seven ininga 

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:55.529
 now we have to be ahead 

00:02:55.529 --> 00:02:58.269
 last month the house 

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:00.719
 in thesis you doubt 

00:03:00.719 --> 00:03:03.889
 we have huge tight 2 to 0 

00:03:03.889 --> 00:03:06.889
 these athletes the bank of people 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:10.519
 so I do not do this striptease 

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:14.169
 obviously you know that it is because 

00:03:14.169 --> 00:03:16.469
 Why are you doing here? 

00:03:16.469 --> 00:03:19.609
 I think she told me that you just do not want a company 

00:03:20.259 --> 00:03:23.049
 unless you to make it a diet 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:26.529
 and passes to vote or did not want to be hot 

00:03:26.529 --> 00:03:30.769
 if you do that video decides now the spokesperson's philosophy of a whore 

00:03:31.759 --> 00:03:33.599
 You are in favor of good 

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:35.689
 left me with these ugly symbols 

00:03:35.689 --> 00:03:37.089
 wrong debbie 

00:03:37.089 --> 00:03:38.419
 the white square 

00:03:38.419 --> 00:03:41.419
 Bobsleigh Prestigious Details 

00:03:41.989 --> 00:03:43.530
 a study done by grandmother 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.660
 with that I'm satisfied with it means dung 

00:03:47.439 --> 00:03:48.949
 plim plim plim 

00:03:48.949 --> 00:03:50.359
 So 

00:03:50.359 --> 00:03:52.329
 I recommend that you do not cooperate 

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:55.329
 coffee already ensures powder sincerely had 

00:03:56.469 --> 00:03:57.500
 wait here 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.889
 All enemies will pass to you, I'm going to die. 

00:04:00.889 --> 00:04:02.259
 pass again 

00:04:02.259 --> 00:04:03.889
 Savio, yes. 

00:04:03.889 --> 00:04:06.029
 It's my room that's gonna happen. 

00:04:06.029 --> 00:04:07.629
 I thought I would go 

00:04:07.629 --> 00:04:10.569
 but for cool it found athlete 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:12.909
 my series against the ticen 

00:04:12.909 --> 00:04:14.319
 what to say 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:15.870
 but they did not hit 

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:18.159
 I decided to have a pedal boat 

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:19.999
 or with a grenade 

00:04:19.999 --> 00:04:22.999
 the perceived karate 

00:04:23.509 --> 00:04:27.129
 then you will have a power and the power to rely too much on your district 

00:04:29.099 --> 00:04:31.159
 as headquarters of departure 

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:32.529
 neymar dunga 

00:04:32.529 --> 00:04:33.930
 obama 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:36.189
 I found between the poet 

00:04:36.189 --> 00:04:39.189
 It's no big deal and Taylor already killed two per game. 

00:04:40.059 --> 00:04:41.889
 is the best event driver 

00:04:41.889 --> 00:04:44.550
 since then 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:45.330
 I trust 

00:04:45.330 --> 00:04:48.909
 always being different but what will get the rally is the turkey is great 

00:04:48.909 --> 00:04:51.139
 the disc repertoire 

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:52.629
 entity 

00:04:52.629 --> 00:04:54.309
 giving the software 

00:04:54.309 --> 00:04:58.209
 I only notice the branch that gets unbalanced to go and we do not intend 

00:04:58.209 --> 00:05:00.499
 sell that legal that dies 

00:05:00.499 --> 00:05:03.800
 people do not like much and die know at least in the very short 

00:05:04.939 --> 00:05:07.999
 the pilot was so the staff we discussed too much 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:12.969
 then our next king is the subject but because he is related 

00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:14.719
 they are quite by the way 

00:05:14.719 --> 00:05:17.719
 dead the entire pt pt 

00:05:19.629 --> 00:05:22.029
 noting that ctc aquino 

00:05:22.029 --> 00:05:24.509
 I look 

00:05:24.509 --> 00:05:26.039
 I chose my ne 

00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:29.139
 we are very happy 

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:32.740
 only a palanque also in the port and aware that it is going to be late for long to be 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:34.139
 fought 

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:36.770
 the rest to accor may 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:39.770
 ewerthon zacharias 

00:05:40.389 --> 00:05:43.159
 and it's very danceable it's an important thing 

00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:45.909
 patios of augusta in the combats 

00:05:45.909 --> 00:05:47.979
 short 

00:05:47.979 --> 00:05:50.979
 the climbs of cycling 

00:05:52.219 --> 00:05:53.490
 in second 

00:05:53.490 --> 00:05:55.060
 how do you forget everything 

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:58.309
 other 

00:05:58.309 --> 00:06:00.879
 He recently called me. 

00:06:00.879 --> 00:06:04.019
 and this was good guys because there are 

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:07.710
 we buy the channel please ' 

00:06:08.499 --> 00:06:11.499
 he also found public in what we are 

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:14.990
 sparrow 

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:16.089
 the wheat
