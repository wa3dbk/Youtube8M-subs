00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
 yes we had a small ride here 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:07.109
 with the youth also with the normal train 

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:09.870
 under quotes and meanwhile 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.940
 he is firmly established in the 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.740
 fan base of the single in the driver you 

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.680
 he is after the presentation at that time as 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:19.529
 they newly arrived somewhat out of favor 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:21.180
 the normal tube at that time because they are not 

00:00:19.529 --> 00:00:24.119
 Radical enough was not cool enough 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:27.480
 Looked in comparison to the radical 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.310
 predecessor devices with ikea then ktm 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.689
 of course, everything was well done and 

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.619
 meanwhile, too 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:36.120
 rumgesprochen 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:40.739
 the something civil the naked bike drives 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:42.050
 as in the past radically fast but clearly 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.370
 more significantly further 

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.289
 possibilities in the field of application in 

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.870
 everyday until I have a nice round today 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:51.870
 drove and we have you the advantages 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.480
 of 4 of them from the single engine of 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:57.600
 We can cost motor -driven costs 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.879
 pulled through the cities and you could 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.129
 almost forgot that here once 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:05.360
 single engine engine works done 

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:07.560
 once untamed beasts now with 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.659
 Double ignition with ride by wire system 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.140
 is that in the city on the way to 

00:01:09.659 --> 00:01:15.060
 work or on the way to school 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:18.060
 really an easy to dose that 

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:20.610
 is really 100% suitable for everyday use 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.360
 nothing just not just more freaks 

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:26.189
 this one cylinder on the other side 

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.720
 can this duke and also like very much 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:30.720
 address a broad target group because the 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:32.790
 Seats are lower than the smt or 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:35.180
 also as with the course that means one 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.799
 Motorcycle which is very wide 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:40.680
 readership here or managed here 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:42.150
 a vehicle can put that to heart 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.829
 easy to drive is a vehicle where 

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.659
 you feel comfortable and fast 

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:48.630
 then take the mountains comes 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:51.450
 vehicle the really purist 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.799
 motorcycle delights sprayed all colleagues 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.600
 here and we drive through many 

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.130
 different bikes bremer of 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.810
 the only one that really descends it 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.020
 always a very special feeling that is 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.390
 somehow motorcycling in his 

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:06.119
 best and most intense way 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.099
 a light motor that insanely fast 

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:10.470
 in the curves are that one 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:12.450
 in terms of performance, but with 70 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.830
 ps the streets in the beautiful curves 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:16.500
 easy to drive here 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.180
 and at the end of the day you ask yourself 

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.970
 then always when you are such an individual 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.049
 gone is what else is there for that 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:26.430
 until march lines 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:28.200
 Here I have everything I need but 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.970
 of course you have to say ktm chooses 

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.709
 here the test tracks always sent 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:34.110
 from the curves here 

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:36.000
 speed 130 140 km h 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.760
 we are indeed a short motorway section 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.560
 but of course we traveled a long way 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.209
 we have not done anything today we have 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:44.940
 here the curves enjoyed 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:47.370
 I would say that while I really do 

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:48.989
 hardcore long- distance data drives there 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.739
 the go this vehicle out nothing 

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:53.819
 From 160 to 170 is the vehicle 

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:55.530
 effortlessly everywhere 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:58.980
 she runs fast but then up 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:01.019
 out it is already a bit strained so 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.880
 Overall, the conclusion with the only one 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:04.410
 motor a vehicle with the one way 

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.239
 can do pretty much everything 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.190
 At the same time , it is also very easy 

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:11.450
 to drive and that is an insane amount 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.450
 made happy
