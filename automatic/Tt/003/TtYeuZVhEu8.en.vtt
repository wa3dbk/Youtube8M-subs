hello there have been some requests for
me<00:00:04.350> to<00:00:04.500> do<00:00:04.940> pre-flight<00:00:05.940> on<00:00:06.330> the<00:00:06.899> air<00:00:06.990> star<00:00:07.290> 601

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
me to do pre-flight on the air star 601

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.650 
me to do pre-flight on the air star 601
P<00:00:08.280> so<00:00:09.269> I<00:00:09.300> thought<00:00:09.719> I'd<00:00:09.840> do<00:00:10.019> that<00:00:10.170> today<00:00:10.500> and<00:00:11.660> as

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:12.660 
P so I thought I'd do that today and as

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.060 
P so I thought I'd do that today and as
a<00:00:12.719> basic<00:00:13.790> guide<00:00:14.790> I<00:00:14.849> have<00:00:15.089> the<00:00:15.540> section<00:00:15.990> 3<00:00:16.800> in

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:17.070 
a basic guide I have the section 3 in

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.189 
a basic guide I have the section 3 in
the<00:00:17.160> pilots<00:00:17.550> operating<00:00:17.880> handbook<00:00:18.150> which<00:00:19.050> is<00:00:19.170> a

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
the pilots operating handbook which is a

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.340 
the pilots operating handbook which is a
very<00:00:19.439> very<00:00:19.500> detailed<00:00:19.830> checklist<00:00:20.960> or<00:00:21.960> what

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
very very detailed checklist or what

very very detailed checklist or what
they<00:00:22.529> think<00:00:22.560> you<00:00:22.890> should<00:00:23.100> do<00:00:23.250> in<00:00:23.460> the

00:00:23.509 --> 00:00:23.519 
they think you should do in the

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:26.060 
they think you should do in the
pre-flight<00:00:23.939> what<00:00:24.810> I<00:00:24.840> think<00:00:25.080> most<00:00:25.320> aircraft

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:26.070 
pre-flight what I think most aircraft

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.670 
pre-flight what I think most aircraft
owners<00:00:26.849> and<00:00:26.880> Pilots<00:00:27.150> do<00:00:27.720> is<00:00:27.960> they<00:00:28.140> kind<00:00:28.349> of<00:00:28.500> do

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
owners and Pilots do is they kind of do

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.709 
owners and Pilots do is they kind of do
their<00:00:29.519> own<00:00:29.550> little<00:00:29.970> abbreviated<00:00:30.330> version<00:00:31.199> of

00:00:32.709 --> 00:00:32.719 
their own little abbreviated version of

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:35.120 
their own little abbreviated version of
pre-flight<00:00:33.719> and<00:00:33.899> that's<00:00:34.140> what<00:00:34.710> I'm<00:00:34.800> gonna<00:00:34.920> do

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:35.130 
pre-flight and that's what I'm gonna do

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.740 
pre-flight and that's what I'm gonna do
today<00:00:35.280> I<00:00:35.610> don't<00:00:36.059> personally<00:00:36.390> have<00:00:36.719> a

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
today I don't personally have a

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.900 
today I don't personally have a
checklist<00:00:37.020> for<00:00:37.260> it<00:00:37.530> I<00:00:37.680> just<00:00:38.100> have<00:00:38.280> kind<00:00:38.670> of<00:00:38.820> a

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
checklist for it I just have kind of a

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.020 
checklist for it I just have kind of a
flow<00:00:39.210> that<00:00:39.540> I<00:00:39.629> do<00:00:40.460> so<00:00:41.460> let<00:00:41.760> me<00:00:41.850> take<00:00:41.969> you

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:42.030 
flow that I do so let me take you

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:42.740 
flow that I do so let me take you
through<00:00:42.120> that<00:00:42.420> one

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:42.750 
through that one

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.660 
through that one
like<00:00:43.200> most<00:00:43.469> Twins<00:00:43.860> and<00:00:44.129> high-performance

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
like most Twins and high-performance

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.389 
like most Twins and high-performance
aircraft<00:00:45.300> there<00:00:45.960> is<00:00:46.079> no<00:00:46.260> real<00:00:46.530> physical<00:00:47.250> way

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
aircraft there is no real physical way

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.450 
aircraft there is no real physical way
of<00:00:47.430> checking<00:00:47.820> the<00:00:48.180> fuel<00:00:48.360> quantity<00:00:48.629> in<00:00:49.460> the

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:50.460 
of checking the fuel quantity in the

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.369 
of checking the fuel quantity in the
aircraft<00:00:50.850> so<00:00:51.090> how<00:00:51.420> do<00:00:51.480> we<00:00:51.570> do<00:00:51.719> that<00:00:51.870> well<00:00:52.079> that

00:00:52.369 --> 00:00:52.379 
aircraft so how do we do that well that

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:54.979 
aircraft so how do we do that well that
is<00:00:53.340> the<00:00:53.550> first<00:00:53.789> step<00:00:54.059> on<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.390> pre-flight<00:00:54.750> and

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:54.989 
is the first step on the pre-flight and

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:57.049 
is the first step on the pre-flight and
you'll<00:00:55.890> see<00:00:56.129> here<00:00:56.280> very<00:00:56.489> shortly<00:00:56.550> that<00:00:56.969> I'll

00:00:57.049 --> 00:00:57.059 
you'll see here very shortly that I'll

00:00:57.059 --> 00:00:59.599 
you'll see here very shortly that I'll
turn<00:00:57.210> the<00:00:57.390> bat<00:00:57.539> battery<00:00:58.050> master<00:00:58.350> on<00:00:58.500> and<00:00:59.250> it'll

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
turn the bat battery master on and it'll

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.150 
turn the bat battery master on and it'll
check<00:00:59.930> the<00:01:00.930> fuel<00:01:01.140> gauges<00:01:01.379> and<00:01:01.680> we<00:01:01.890> will<00:01:02.010> also

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
check the fuel gauges and we will also

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.070 
check the fuel gauges and we will also
double-check<00:01:02.609> with<00:01:03.359> the<00:01:03.480> shade<00:01:03.690> in<00:01:03.840> fuel

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
double-check with the shade in fuel

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:04.729 
double-check with the shade in fuel

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
totalizer

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.590 
totalizer
to<00:01:05.070> see<00:01:05.250> if<00:01:05.400> they<00:01:05.519> correspond<00:01:08.090> as<00:01:09.090> you<00:01:09.299> can<00:01:09.420> see

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
to see if they correspond as you can see

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.340 
to see if they correspond as you can see
here<00:01:09.869> the<00:01:10.049> arrow<00:01:10.260> star<00:01:10.590> has<00:01:10.970> three<00:01:12.350> tank

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
here the arrow star has three tank

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.950 
here the arrow star has three tank
gauges<00:01:13.770> one<00:01:14.580> is<00:01:14.820> the<00:01:15.150> center<00:01:15.330> tank<00:01:15.630> reach<00:01:15.810> the

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:15.960 
gauges one is the center tank reach the

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.230 
gauges one is the center tank reach the
fuselage<00:01:16.380> tank<00:01:16.650> and<00:01:16.950> then<00:01:17.700> you<00:01:17.820> have<00:01:17.939> the<00:01:18.030> left

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
fuselage tank and then you have the left

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:20.780 
fuselage tank and then you have the left
wing<00:01:18.450> and<00:01:18.630> the<00:01:18.689> right<00:01:18.720> wing<00:01:19.140> and<00:01:19.460> as<00:01:20.460> you<00:01:20.670> can

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
wing and the right wing and as you can

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.090 
wing and the right wing and as you can
see<00:01:20.850> here<00:01:21.390> it<00:01:21.600> shows<00:01:21.630> well<00:01:22.439> I<00:01:22.470> would<00:01:22.799> say<00:01:22.950> about

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
see here it shows well I would say about

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.999 
see here it shows well I would say about
25<00:01:23.640> gallons<00:01:24.150> in<00:01:24.240> the<00:01:24.330> center<00:01:24.600> tank<00:01:24.840> and<00:01:25.110> five

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
25 gallons in the center tank and five

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:27.679 
25 gallons in the center tank and five
gallons<00:01:26.520> in<00:01:26.759> each<00:01:26.880> wing<00:01:27.150> which<00:01:27.360> is<00:01:27.390> pretty

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
gallons in each wing which is pretty

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:31.069 
gallons in each wing which is pretty
much<00:01:27.950> true<00:01:28.950> to<00:01:29.640> my<00:01:29.850> computations<00:01:30.689> after<00:01:30.990> the

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
much true to my computations after the

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:32.330 
much true to my computations after the
last<00:01:31.259> flight<00:01:31.470> I<00:01:31.500> haven't<00:01:31.829> fueled<00:01:32.070> her<00:01:32.189> up

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
last flight I haven't fueled her up

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:35.060 
last flight I haven't fueled her up
since<00:01:32.579> the<00:01:32.700> last<00:01:32.850> flight<00:01:33.799> now

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
since the last flight now

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.530 
since the last flight now
it's<00:01:35.189> hard<00:01:35.430> to<00:01:35.520> tell<00:01:35.759> here<00:01:36.060> but<00:01:36.090> on<00:01:36.420> the

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540 
it's hard to tell here but on the

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:38.749 
it's hard to tell here but on the
unknown<00:01:36.840> theater<00:01:37.170> panel<00:01:37.530> here<00:01:37.740> there's<00:01:38.490> also

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
unknown theater panel here there's also

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.510 
unknown theater panel here there's also
a<00:01:38.909> low<00:01:39.210> fuel<00:01:39.990> warning<00:01:40.409> light<00:01:40.799> that<00:01:41.159> should<00:01:41.369> be

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
a low fuel warning light that should be

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.270 
a low fuel warning light that should be
out<00:01:41.729> that<00:01:42.299> goes<00:01:42.600> on<00:01:42.899> when<00:01:43.320> the<00:01:43.470> fuselage<00:01:44.009> tank

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
out that goes on when the fuselage tank

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:48.410 
out that goes on when the fuselage tank
has<00:01:44.670> 12<00:01:45.180> gallons<00:01:45.780> left<00:01:45.990> in<00:01:46.290> it<00:01:46.549> and<00:01:47.549> I<00:01:47.850> don't

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
has 12 gallons left in it and I don't

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.660 
has 12 gallons left in it and I don't
think<00:01:48.750> you<00:01:48.840> can<00:01:48.990> see<00:01:49.170> it<00:01:49.290> but<00:01:49.530> it's<00:01:49.710> it's

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:50.670 
think you can see it but it's it's

00:01:50.670 --> 00:02:45.230 
think you can see it but it's it's
actually<00:01:51.030> out<00:01:51.180> here

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:45.240 

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:49.630 

now<00:02:45.780> the<00:02:45.840> air<00:02:46.080> store<00:02:46.440> has<00:02:47.270> three<00:02:48.270> main<00:02:48.870> drains

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640 
now the air store has three main drains

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.560 
now the air store has three main drains
one<00:02:50.640> for<00:02:50.850> each<00:02:50.910> tank

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:51.570 
one for each tank

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:53.690 
one for each tank
one<00:02:51.930> for<00:02:52.140> each<00:02:52.170> wing<00:02:52.500> and<00:02:52.770> then<00:02:53.160> the<00:02:53.370> center

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
one for each wing and then the center

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.180 
one for each wing and then the center
fuselage<00:02:54.150> tank<00:02:54.390> it<00:02:55.140> also<00:02:55.320> has<00:02:55.680> a<00:02:55.709> fuel

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:56.190 
fuselage tank it also has a fuel

00:02:56.190 --> 00:02:58.790 
fuselage tank it also has a fuel
ventilation<00:02:56.910> drain<00:02:57.150> system<00:02:57.660> if<00:02:58.200> you<00:02:58.530> have<00:02:58.769> a

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 
ventilation drain system if you have a

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.400 
ventilation drain system if you have a
certain<00:02:59.100> modification<00:02:59.940> that<00:03:00.060> I<00:03:00.150> have<00:03:00.410> to

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.410 
certain modification that I have to

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:05.330 
certain modification that I have to
ventilate<00:03:02.070> the<00:03:02.910> wing<00:03:03.630> tanks<00:03:04.050> and<00:03:04.560> what

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
ventilate the wing tanks and what

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.300 
ventilate the wing tanks and what
normally<00:03:05.760> happens<00:03:05.790> is<00:03:06.470> that<00:03:07.470> a<00:03:07.530> lot<00:03:07.830> of<00:03:07.980> fuel

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:08.310 
normally happens is that a lot of fuel

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:10.190 
normally happens is that a lot of fuel
gets<00:03:08.730> caught<00:03:08.970> up<00:03:09.090> in<00:03:09.209> this<00:03:09.330> ventilation<00:03:09.810> tract

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:10.200 
gets caught up in this ventilation tract

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.030 
gets caught up in this ventilation tract
and<00:03:11.239> it<00:03:12.239> has<00:03:12.390> to<00:03:12.510> do<00:03:12.660> with<00:03:12.690> thermal<00:03:13.410> expansion

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
and it has to do with thermal expansion

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.370 
and it has to do with thermal expansion
and<00:03:14.160> stuff<00:03:14.400> so<00:03:15.390> you<00:03:15.690> always<00:03:15.840> have<00:03:16.050> to<00:03:16.140> drain

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380 
and stuff so you always have to drain

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:19.780 
and stuff so you always have to drain
that<00:03:16.709> and<00:03:17.180> this<00:03:18.180> time<00:03:18.450> it<00:03:19.050> was<00:03:19.200> one<00:03:19.500> cup

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:19.790 
that and this time it was one cup

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:22.100 
that and this time it was one cup
normally<00:03:20.790> when<00:03:21.060> you<00:03:21.150> filled<00:03:21.570> her<00:03:21.720> up<00:03:21.900> and

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:22.110 
normally when you filled her up and

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:23.449 
normally when you filled her up and
she's<00:03:22.290> been<00:03:22.470> sitting<00:03:22.769> on<00:03:22.830> the<00:03:22.950> tarmac<00:03:23.130> on<00:03:23.430> a

00:03:23.449 --> 00:03:23.459 
she's been sitting on the tarmac on a

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:26.390 
she's been sitting on the tarmac on a
hot<00:03:23.670> day<00:03:23.910> they<00:03:24.630> can<00:03:24.810> take<00:03:25.019> up<00:03:25.380> to<00:03:25.440> seven<00:03:26.310> or

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
hot day they can take up to seven or

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.210 
hot day they can take up to seven or
eight<00:03:26.550> of<00:03:26.700> these<00:03:26.820> cups<00:03:27.120> to<00:03:27.660> drain<00:03:28.220> the

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.220 
eight of these cups to drain the

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:48.050 
eight of these cups to drain the
ventilation<00:03:30.000> system<00:03:46.220> not<00:03:47.220> in<00:03:47.370> an<00:03:47.489> easy<00:03:47.700> way<00:03:48.000> at

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060 
ventilation system not in an easy way at

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:49.880 
ventilation system not in an easy way at
least<00:03:48.239> so<00:03:48.660> it's<00:03:48.930> always<00:03:49.140> exposed<00:03:49.650> to<00:03:49.799> the

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:49.890 
least so it's always exposed to the

00:03:49.890 --> 00:03:50.990 
least so it's always exposed to the
weather<00:03:49.980> element<00:03:50.430> so<00:03:50.489> it's<00:03:50.610> important<00:03:50.910> to

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
weather element so it's important to

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.580 
weather element so it's important to
have<00:03:51.120> a<00:03:51.150> little<00:03:51.450> look<00:03:51.570> at<00:03:51.690> that<00:03:51.870> see<00:03:52.470> that

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:52.590 
have a little look at that see that

00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:54.289 
have a little look at that see that
there<00:03:52.739> are<00:03:52.769> there<00:03:52.920> obvious<00:03:53.370> obstructions<00:03:54.120> or

00:03:54.289 --> 00:03:54.299 
there are there obvious obstructions or

00:03:54.299 --> 00:04:26.120 
there are there obvious obstructions or
anything<00:03:54.510> like<00:03:54.780> that

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:26.130 

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:27.620 

so<00:04:26.490> what<00:04:26.639> you<00:04:26.730> want<00:04:26.880> to<00:04:26.940> look<00:04:27.060> for<00:04:27.240> here<00:04:27.480> is

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:27.630 
so what you want to look for here is

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:29.450 
so what you want to look for here is
basically<00:04:27.990> there's<00:04:28.260> no<00:04:28.410> you<00:04:28.830> know<00:04:28.860> obviously

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:29.460 
basically there's no you know obviously

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:34.220 
basically there's no you know obviously
'qs<00:04:30.169> on<00:04:31.169> the<00:04:31.290> disc<00:04:31.500> brakes<00:04:31.770> or<00:04:31.950> the<00:04:32.010> disc<00:04:33.230> or

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:34.230 
'qs on the disc brakes or the disc or

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:36.290 
'qs on the disc brakes or the disc or
the<00:04:34.290> brake<00:04:34.530> kill<00:04:34.800> line<00:04:35.040> you<00:04:35.820> also<00:04:36.000> want<00:04:36.240> to

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
the brake kill line you also want to

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.780 
the brake kill line you also want to
look<00:04:36.390> that<00:04:36.630> there's<00:04:36.870> enough<00:04:37.140> this<00:04:38.010> brake<00:04:38.490> pads

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:38.790 
look that there's enough this brake pads

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:54.170 
look that there's enough this brake pads
left<00:04:49.070> brake<00:04:50.070> the<00:04:50.700> wheel<00:04:50.880> to<00:04:51.150> spin<00:04:52.880> and<00:04:53.880> also

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:54.180 
left brake the wheel to spin and also

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:55.580 
left brake the wheel to spin and also
when<00:04:54.570> you're<00:04:54.660> down<00:04:54.870> here<00:04:55.080> it's<00:04:55.320> very<00:04:55.380> very

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:55.590 
when you're down here it's very very

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:59.210 
when you're down here it's very very
important<00:04:56.130> to<00:04:56.310> check<00:04:56.940> the<00:04:57.330> exhausts<00:04:57.990> and<00:04:58.220> put

00:04:59.210 --> 00:04:59.220 
important to check the exhausts and put

00:04:59.220 --> 00:05:00.680 
important to check the exhausts and put
a<00:04:59.250> firm<00:04:59.610> shake<00:05:00.000> on<00:05:00.210> them<00:05:00.390> and<00:05:00.540> see<00:05:00.660> that

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:00.690 
a firm shake on them and see that

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:02.930 
a firm shake on them and see that
they're<00:05:00.930> not<00:05:01.110> rattling<00:05:01.590> or<00:05:01.680> anything<00:05:01.940> because

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:02.940 
they're not rattling or anything because

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:05.330 
they're not rattling or anything because
if<00:05:03.180> they<00:05:03.330> are<00:05:03.360> that's<00:05:04.229> an<00:05:04.500> immediate<00:05:04.770> no-go

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:05.340 
if they are that's an immediate no-go

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:09.290 
if they are that's an immediate no-go
because<00:05:06.350> that<00:05:07.350> means<00:05:07.620> you<00:05:07.740> probably<00:05:08.270> will<00:05:09.270> the

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:09.300 
because that means you probably will the

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:11.150 
because that means you probably will the
chances<00:05:09.750> of<00:05:09.780> an<00:05:09.990> engine<00:05:10.290> fire<00:05:10.530> or<00:05:10.890> engine

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:11.160 
chances of an engine fire or engine

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:14.450 
chances of an engine fire or engine
compartment<00:05:11.610> fire<00:05:11.960> increases<00:05:12.960> a<00:05:13.110> lot<00:05:13.350> so<00:05:14.160> this

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:14.460 
compartment fire increases a lot so this

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:16.219 
compartment fire increases a lot so this
is<00:05:14.550> a<00:05:14.580> big<00:05:14.820> thing<00:05:15.090> on<00:05:15.270> the<00:05:15.360> paper<00:05:15.539> Aerostars

00:05:16.219 --> 00:05:16.229 
is a big thing on the paper Aerostars

00:05:16.229 --> 00:05:18.440 
is a big thing on the paper Aerostars
and<00:05:16.380> most<00:05:17.130> high-performance<00:05:17.400> twins<00:05:18.060> you<00:05:18.240> have

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:16.710 
little bit of hydraulic leak there just

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:19.670 
little bit of hydraulic leak there just
by<00:06:16.920> the<00:06:16.980> o-ring<00:06:17.460> of<00:06:17.700> that<00:06:18.300> actuator<00:06:18.810> it's<00:06:19.500> not

00:06:19.670 --> 00:06:19.680 
by the o-ring of that actuator it's not

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:22.640 
by the o-ring of that actuator it's not
a<00:06:19.710> major<00:06:20.010> saying<00:06:20.490> but<00:06:21.150> it<00:06:21.810> should<00:06:22.080> be<00:06:22.230> looked

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:22.650 
a major saying but it should be looked

00:06:22.650 --> 00:06:31.370 
a major saying but it should be looked
at<00:06:23.100> at<00:06:23.550> some<00:06:23.820> point<00:06:29.930> that<00:06:30.930> pretty<00:06:31.200> much

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:31.380 
at at some point that pretty much

at at some point that pretty much
concludes<00:06:32.010> the<00:06:32.700> brief<00:06:33.240> flight<00:06:33.510> on<00:06:33.840> the<00:06:34.040> piper

air<00:06:35.220> source<00:06:35.490> takes<00:06:35.730> a<00:06:35.850> 1<00:06:36.090> p<00:06:36.390> as<00:06:36.960> you<00:06:37.110> can<00:06:37.230> see

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:37.350 
air source takes a 1 p as you can see

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:38.780 
air source takes a 1 p as you can see
it's<00:06:37.530> pretty<00:06:37.650> simple<00:06:37.770> is<00:06:38.190> actually<00:06:38.520> a<00:06:38.550> little

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:38.790 
it's pretty simple is actually a little

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:42.050 
it's pretty simple is actually a little
bit<00:06:38.940> less<00:06:39.440> to<00:06:40.440> do<00:06:40.620> on<00:06:40.890> this<00:06:41.010> one<00:06:41.250> and<00:06:41.490> then<00:06:41.940> they

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:42.060 
bit less to do on this one and then they

00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:46.070 
bit less to do on this one and then they
used<00:06:42.210> to<00:06:42.300> be<00:06:42.390> on<00:06:42.480> my<00:06:42.510> old<00:06:42.840> air<00:06:42.990> commander<00:06:44.900> okay

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:46.080 
used to be on my old air commander okay

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:47.990 
used to be on my old air commander okay
that<00:06:46.230> only<00:06:46.410> leaves<00:06:46.620> the<00:06:46.920> fine<00:06:47.130> so<00:06:47.610> let's<00:06:47.910> go

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:48.000 
that only leaves the fine so let's go

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:57.780 
that only leaves the fine so let's go
find
