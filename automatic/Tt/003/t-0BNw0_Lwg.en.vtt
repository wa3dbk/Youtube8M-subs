you like the stadium anyway as you can
see<00:01:16.159> here<00:01:16.960> hey<00:01:20.860> there's<00:01:21.860> lines<00:01:22.159> now<00:01:22.580> the

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640 
see here hey there's lines now the

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.880 
see here hey there's lines now the
beyblades<00:01:23.180> get<00:01:23.420> caught<00:01:23.750> in<00:01:23.960> these<00:01:24.110> lines<00:01:24.409> but

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
beyblades get caught in these lines but

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.039 
beyblades get caught in these lines but
does<00:01:25.580> that<00:01:25.610> the<00:01:26.060> lives<00:01:26.270> of<00:01:26.420> learning<00:01:26.870> there's

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:27.049 
does that the lives of learning there's

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:30.250 
does that the lives of learning there's
when<00:01:27.380> it<00:01:27.500> was<00:01:27.590> folded<00:01:27.790> but<00:01:28.790> the<00:01:29.690> problem<00:01:29.900> is

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:30.260 
when it was folded but the problem is

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:33.430 
when it was folded but the problem is
that<00:01:30.890> the<00:01:31.670> babies<00:01:32.030> don't<00:01:32.060> really<00:01:32.540> get<00:01:33.140> caught

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:33.440 
that the babies don't really get caught

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:35.830 
that the babies don't really get caught
they<00:01:33.619> get<00:01:33.799> caught<00:01:34.100> so<00:01:34.400> they<00:01:34.520> can't<00:01:34.790> escape<00:01:34.940> so

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
they get caught so they can't escape so

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.030 
they get caught so they can't escape so
I'm<00:01:35.900> going<00:01:36.080> to<00:01:36.110> put<00:01:36.260> something<00:01:36.530> over<00:01:36.619> it<00:01:36.860> i

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:37.040 
I'm going to put something over it i

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.039 
I'm going to put something over it i
have<00:01:37.190> basically<00:01:38.030> i've<00:01:38.240> barely<00:01:38.570> finished<00:01:38.930> a

00:01:39.039 --> 00:01:39.049 
have basically i've barely finished a

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:42.399 
have basically i've barely finished a
prototype<00:01:39.530> which<00:01:39.740> ice<00:01:40.369> cream<00:01:40.820> well<00:01:41.450> i<00:01:42.140> want<00:01:42.380> a

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:42.409 
prototype which ice cream well i want a

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:46.380 
prototype which ice cream well i want a
schematic<00:01:43.010> it's<00:01:43.700> a<00:01:43.790> basic<00:01:44.060> a<00:01:44.150> year<00:01:44.360> hurry<00:01:44.960> up

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:46.390 
schematic it's a basic a year hurry up

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.450 
schematic it's a basic a year hurry up
so<00:01:47.390> maybe<00:01:47.570> legs<00:01:47.810> get<00:01:48.020> caught<00:01:48.320> in<00:01:49.070> the<00:01:49.100> lines

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:49.460 
so maybe legs get caught in the lines

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.410 
so maybe legs get caught in the lines
and<00:01:50.000> then<00:01:50.810> they<00:01:50.990> the<00:01:51.260> baby<00:01:51.500> just<00:01:51.860> go<00:01:52.130> we'd<00:01:52.850> need

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:53.420 
and then they the baby just go we'd need

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.500 
and then they the baby just go we'd need
they<00:01:53.930> do<00:01:53.990> hit<00:01:54.380> they<00:01:54.530> do<00:01:54.710> move<00:01:54.920> in<00:01:55.250> the<00:01:55.369> light<00:01:55.580> so

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:56.510 
they do hit they do move in the light so

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:58.630 
they do hit they do move in the light so
yeah<00:01:57.049> it's<00:01:57.680> gonna<00:01:57.860> show<00:01:58.040> you<00:01:58.100> a<00:01:58.220> couple<00:01:58.430> of
