00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:14.040 
definitely makes a difference have been
the<00:04:11.860> better<00:04:12.310> pickups<00:04:12.700> in<00:04:12.820> there<00:04:12.970> and<00:04:13.750> you<00:04:13.960> know

the better pickups in there and you know

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:15.540 
the better pickups in there and you know
why<00:04:14.350> I've<00:04:14.500> never<00:04:14.710> changed<00:04:15.010> the<00:04:15.220> wiring<00:04:15.520> out

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:15.550 
why I've never changed the wiring out

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:17.340 
why I've never changed the wiring out
the<00:04:15.760> pop<00:04:15.970> so<00:04:16.150> I<00:04:16.180> think<00:04:16.330> that<00:04:16.540> so<00:04:16.750> I<00:04:16.780> hear<00:04:17.230> a<00:04:17.290> lot

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:17.350 
the pop so I think that so I hear a lot

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:18.660 
the pop so I think that so I hear a lot
of<00:04:17.470> guys<00:04:17.620> do<00:04:17.799> and<00:04:17.950> they<00:04:18.040> sound<00:04:18.280> much<00:04:18.459> much

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:18.670

better<00:04:18.820> which<00:04:19.030> I'm<00:04:19.120> sure<00:04:19.270> they<00:04:19.390> do

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:20.970 
better which I'm sure they do

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:24.300 
better which I'm sure they do
before<00:04:21.970> I<00:04:22.000> use<00:04:22.210> these<00:04:22.360> were<00:04:22.540> they<00:04:23.470> sound<00:04:23.740> you

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:24.310

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:26.320 
know to dish out by and stay in tune I

00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:28.890 
know to dish out by and stay in tune I
said<00:04:26.650> I<00:04:26.680> don't<00:04:26.800> really<00:04:27.010> use<00:04:27.450> with<00:04:28.450> any<00:04:28.660> of<00:04:28.810> the

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:28.900 
said I don't really use with any of the

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:30.570 
said I don't really use with any of the
last<00:04:29.080> you<00:04:29.200> stay<00:04:29.350> in<00:04:29.410> tune<00:04:29.740> because<00:04:30.340> either

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:32.890 
I've been lucky or I think it depends on

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:33.990 
I've been lucky or I think it depends on
where<00:04:33.100> you<00:04:33.340> get<00:04:33.550> these<00:04:33.700> from
