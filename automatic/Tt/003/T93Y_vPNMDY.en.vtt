00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.690
 hello android friends but they are 

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:17.410
 happening very well today we bring you a 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:20.590
 a bit spectacular video can be 

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:22.900
 say so since it has leaked or more 

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:26.410
 well it has come out and the camera of 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:29.140
 phone nexus 5 as they have already come 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:31.480
 showing the specifications of the 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:36.160
 new android operating system that 

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:40.210
 would be 4.4 kat kit because now it has 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:41.019
 the camera came out in a pk and here are the 

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:42.880
 we have 

00:00:41.019 --> 00:00:45.640
 remember totally free in the 

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:47.890
 description of the video will be the 

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:51.460
 camera application that would be 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:55.950
 here we have it, we are going to open it and 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:59.800
 how they see it is going to be the camera of the 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:02.020
 nexus 5 here as we could see it and 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:05.009
 we have other settings to touch 

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:09.009
 the screen is how you are seeing it 

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:11.710
 we would have what would be the opposition of 

00:01:09.009 --> 00:01:14.950
 phone is good to leave it at +1 

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:16.680
 there it would be fine we have the most 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:20.860
 options that would be 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:23.080
 the timer select the time the 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.790
 size of the image is always 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:28.300
 function simply works when 

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:30.670
 we have the front camera and the mode 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:34.600
 of the scene that would be sunset in 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:37.830
 no effect at night and action 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.420
 we are going to leave the action 

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:41.640
 and something that has called us a lot 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:44.130
 Attention is that when making a 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:47.180
 show we can do the show us like 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.320
 as if we were in an image 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:52.200
 extending the screen with both 

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:56.100
 fingers and how are you seeing and we can see 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:58.380
 the number of song we make at the same 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.770
 weather 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:05.520
 the applied pulls pretty well does not give us 

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:07.970
 failures or anything like that now where 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.709
 there is the little camera there we see several 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:14.280
 several options what would this be that 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:18.000
 would be to take a picture this would be 

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:20.790
 to record a video this would be the 

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.920
 from our gallery and this would be the 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:25.930
 to take a panoramic photo 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.630
 there are the four options the four 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:31.090
 they work well there is no problem 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:33.640
 and as we say the camera is 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.920
 pretty good takes the images pretty 

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:39.310
 well we are going to leave you 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:42.849
 some images taken by the phone 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:45.550
 samsung galaxy s3 mini the application 

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:47.980
 I was pulling on the galaxy s3 mini not 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:53.050
 I've tested it on other devices with 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:55.680
 Android 4.0 below work on the 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:58.810
 apk most likely would be that 

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:01.720
 that works with conversions of 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:05.470
 Android 4.0 onwards that would be 

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:09.430
 ice cream sandwich and then that would be all 

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:11.769
 we are going to leave you some catches and 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:16.209
 to take the picture you just know 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:19.360
 touch the little blue circle and 

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:22.780
 will give us the autofocus and will take 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:24.180
 the image then we are going to take several 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:28.420
 images 

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:31.060
 and we will see them 

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:34.660
 so they can see that they have a quality 

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:36.190
 quite pretty good and we are seeing 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:38.200
 that the camera is working at 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:42.610
 perfection and as we see we are going to 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:46.300
 show them the application that gives us 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:48.550
 the app of mÃ©rida we are going to open it for 

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:51.760
 see that also operates the mode 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:54.730
 camera on we will 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:57.620
 select the options and the camera 

00:03:54.730 --> 00:04:02.510
 frontal camera 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:05.659
 and as you see, you are also talking 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:07.370
 the front camera what stretches the 

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:10.610
 forward camera 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:13.459
 and that would be in the aspect of the camera 

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:17.840
 if we play this part like they appear 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:20.840
 the configurations we are going to return the 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:23.810
 rear camera 

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:26.449
 and we're going to go out and as I say I'm going 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:29.960
 to show to the camera of the galaxy s3 

00:04:26.449 --> 00:04:32.680
 what would be this more is bigger what 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:32.680
 let's move here 

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:41.210
 and they eat tell me tell them we open it 

00:04:38.330 --> 00:04:43.550
 it's totally different well 

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:46.580
 the quality looks pretty good too 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:48.199
 But the photos will take the same 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:50.840
 We have even liked how they take 

00:04:48.199 --> 00:04:54.500
 things plus her phone camera 

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:58.840
 of nexus 5 the same application if 

00:04:54.500 --> 00:05:02.139
 We flipped the camera will work 

00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:05.830
 work pretty well because that would be 

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:07.510
