you<00:02:33.379> know<00:02:33.500> the<00:02:33.620> great<00:02:33.799> thing<00:02:33.830> about<00:02:34.069> this

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:34.370 
you know the great thing about this

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:36.970 
you know the great thing about this
whole<00:02:34.580> duel<00:02:34.970> vehicle<00:02:35.480> design<00:02:35.900> thing<00:02:36.290> it's<00:02:36.799> not

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:36.980 
whole duel vehicle design thing it's not

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:38.229 
whole duel vehicle design thing it's not
just<00:02:37.040> that<00:02:37.370> they're<00:02:37.549> different<00:02:37.970> it's<00:02:38.090> that

00:02:38.229 --> 00:02:38.239 
just that they're different it's that

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:40.149 
just that they're different it's that
they<00:02:38.360> complement<00:02:38.959> each<00:02:38.989> other<00:02:39.260> too<00:02:39.560> so<00:02:40.010> like

00:02:40.149 --> 00:02:40.159 
they complement each other too so like

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:41.979 
they complement each other too so like
the<00:02:40.310> strengths<00:02:40.700> of<00:02:40.790> the<00:02:40.909> helicopter<00:02:41.510> they

00:02:41.979 --> 00:02:41.989 
the strengths of the helicopter they

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:43.479 
the strengths of the helicopter they
actually<00:02:42.349> make<00:02:42.500> up<00:02:42.680> for<00:02:42.830> the<00:02:42.890> weaknesses<00:02:43.430> of

00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:43.489 
actually make up for the weaknesses of

00:02:43.489 --> 00:02:45.820 
actually make up for the weaknesses of
the<00:02:43.670> jeep<00:02:43.879> and<00:02:44.030> vice<00:02:44.480> versa<00:02:44.780> to<00:02:45.140> be<00:02:45.650> there

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:45.830 
the jeep and vice versa to be there

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:47.289 
the jeep and vice versa to be there
their<00:02:46.129> enemies<00:02:46.459> the<00:02:46.610> helicopter<00:02:47.120> might

00:02:47.289 --> 00:02:47.299 
their enemies the helicopter might

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:49.030 
their enemies the helicopter might
struggle<00:02:47.569> with<00:02:47.720> but<00:02:48.349> then<00:02:48.470> the<00:02:48.650> Jeep<00:02:48.860> will

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
struggle with but then the Jeep will

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.280 
struggle with but then the Jeep will
just<00:02:49.280> annihilate<00:02:50.030> you<00:02:50.239> know<00:02:50.329> so<00:02:50.569> so<00:02:50.989> it's<00:02:51.110> also

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:51.290 
just annihilate you know so so it's also

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.170 
just annihilate you know so so it's also
one<00:02:51.590> of<00:02:51.620> those<00:02:51.799> hey<00:02:52.340> I'll<00:02:52.489> take<00:02:52.700> this<00:02:52.909> guy<00:02:53.120> you

one of those hey I'll take this guy you
take<00:02:53.540> that<00:02:53.780> guy<00:02:53.959> games<00:02:54.260> which<00:02:54.680> to<00:02:55.129> me<00:02:55.280> are

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
take that guy games which to me are

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:57.490 
take that guy games which to me are
always<00:02:55.819> the<00:02:56.000> most<00:02:56.180> fun<00:02:56.329> kind<00:02:56.780> of<00:02:56.810> games<00:02:57.049> but

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:57.500 
always the most fun kind of games but

00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:58.990 
always the most fun kind of games but
again<00:02:57.739> the<00:02:57.860> fact<00:02:58.069> that<00:02:58.159> it's<00:02:58.340> on<00:02:58.430> the<00:02:58.519> NES

00:02:58.990 --> 00:02:59.000 
again the fact that it's on the NES

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.539 
again the fact that it's on the NES
which<00:02:59.569> isn't<00:03:00.079> necessarily<00:03:00.799> a<00:03:00.980> system<00:03:01.400> people

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:01.549 
which isn't necessarily a system people

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:03.729 
which isn't necessarily a system people
think<00:03:01.909> up<00:03:02.060> for<00:03:02.239> shoot-'em-ups<00:03:02.720> I<00:03:03.019> think<00:03:03.590> that

00:03:03.729 --> 00:03:03.739 
think up for shoot-'em-ups I think that

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:05.830 
think up for shoot-'em-ups I think that
might<00:03:03.920> be<00:03:03.950> the<00:03:04.160> coolest<00:03:04.400> thing<00:03:04.579> of<00:03:04.670> all<00:03:04.840> well

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
might be the coolest thing of all well

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.710 
might be the coolest thing of all well
except<00:03:06.109> for<00:03:06.140> the<00:03:06.319> explosions<00:03:07.160> of<00:03:07.280> friends<00:03:07.720> now

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
except for the explosions of friends now

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.509 
except for the explosions of friends now
that's<00:03:08.959> cooler<00:03:09.230> than<00:03:09.349> blown<00:03:09.739> up<00:03:09.980> strangers

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:10.519 
that's cooler than blown up strangers

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:24.640 
that's cooler than blown up strangers
with<00:03:10.760> people<00:03:11.090> you<00:03:11.239> love<00:03:11.450> you<00:03:11.870> guys

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:26.949 

so<00:03:25.069> the<00:03:25.159> game<00:03:25.340> has<00:03:25.370> a<00:03:25.610> cold<00:03:25.940> design<00:03:26.360> gimmick<00:03:26.810> it

00:03:26.949 --> 00:03:26.959 
so the game has a cold design gimmick it

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:29.440 
so the game has a cold design gimmick it
plays<00:03:27.260> great<00:03:27.709> it<00:03:27.950> looks<00:03:28.280> awesome<00:03:28.819> like<00:03:29.060> I<00:03:29.090> said

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450 
plays great it looks awesome like I said

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:30.940 
plays great it looks awesome like I said
I'd<00:03:29.569> love<00:03:29.780> some<00:03:30.049> of<00:03:30.080> these<00:03:30.200> backgrounds<00:03:30.769> all

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:30.950 
I'd love some of these backgrounds all

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:32.830 
I'd love some of these backgrounds all
very<00:03:31.190> colorful<00:03:31.700> it's<00:03:32.060> like<00:03:32.209> a<00:03:32.239> confetti<00:03:32.720> of

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:32.840 
very colorful it's like a confetti of

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.830 
very colorful it's like a confetti of
blood<00:03:33.620> and<00:03:34.040> explosions<00:03:34.700> which<00:03:34.909> is<00:03:35.060> just<00:03:35.299> the

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
blood and explosions which is just the

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.809 
blood and explosions which is just the
best<00:03:36.049> kind<00:03:36.349> of<00:03:36.470> confetti<00:03:36.830> what<00:03:37.640> are<00:03:37.730> those

00:03:37.809 --> 00:03:37.819 
best kind of confetti what are those

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:39.640 
best kind of confetti what are those
issues<00:03:37.879> we<00:03:38.360> talked<00:03:38.599> about<00:03:38.720> earlier<00:03:39.140> well<00:03:39.470> for

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:39.650 
issues we talked about earlier well for

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:42.369 
issues we talked about earlier well for
starters<00:03:39.890> that<00:03:40.340> focus<00:03:41.180> on<00:03:41.299> multiplayer<00:03:41.720> makes

00:03:42.369 --> 00:03:42.379 
starters that focus on multiplayer makes

00:03:42.379 --> 00:03:44.860 
starters that focus on multiplayer makes
playing<00:03:42.650> this<00:03:42.860> alone<00:03:43.190> a<00:03:43.489> lot<00:03:43.940> less<00:03:44.150> fun<00:03:44.450> I<00:03:44.690> mean

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:44.870 
playing this alone a lot less fun I mean

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:46.420 
playing this alone a lot less fun I mean
it's<00:03:44.989> still<00:03:45.140> good<00:03:45.440> don't<00:03:45.680> leave<00:03:45.799> me<00:03:45.890> wrong<00:03:46.099> but

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:46.430 
it's still good don't leave me wrong but

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.520 
it's still good don't leave me wrong but
it's<00:03:47.120> nowhere<00:03:47.269> near<00:03:47.420> as<00:03:47.690> fun<00:03:47.930> as<00:03:48.140> when<00:03:48.290> both

00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:48.530 
it's nowhere near as fun as when both

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:50.470 
it's nowhere near as fun as when both
vehicles<00:03:48.860> are<00:03:49.129> on<00:03:49.280> the<00:03:49.370> screen<00:03:49.610> also<00:03:50.239> it's

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:50.480 
vehicles are on the screen also it's

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.930 
vehicles are on the screen also it's
crazy<00:03:50.750> tough<00:03:51.110> on<00:03:51.319> your<00:03:51.470> own<00:03:51.620> too<00:03:51.920> I<00:03:52.129> mean<00:03:52.640> look

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:52.940 
crazy tough on your own too I mean look

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:55.000 
crazy tough on your own too I mean look
if<00:03:53.239> it<00:03:53.390> weren't<00:03:53.569> for<00:03:53.690> the<00:03:53.870> game<00:03:54.049> genie<00:03:54.349> I<00:03:54.620> would

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.010 
if it weren't for the game genie I would

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:58.839 
if it weren't for the game genie I would
have<00:03:55.099> been<00:03:55.599> says<00:03:56.599> every<00:03:57.079> kid<00:03:57.319> ever<00:03:57.560> in<00:03:57.890> 1989

00:03:58.839 --> 00:03:58.849 
have been says every kid ever in 1989

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:00.550 
have been says every kid ever in 1989
actually<00:03:59.599> the<00:03:59.690> game<00:03:59.810> doesn't<00:04:00.109> really<00:04:00.230> evolve

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:00.560 
actually the game doesn't really evolve

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.830 
actually the game doesn't really evolve
that<00:04:00.680> much<00:04:00.890> either<00:04:01.040> like<00:04:01.400> like<00:04:02.239> the<00:04:02.480> enemies

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 
that much either like like the enemies

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.869 
that much either like like the enemies
stay<00:04:03.109> basically<00:04:03.890> the<00:04:04.040> same<00:04:04.220> from<00:04:04.489> level<00:04:04.819> to

00:04:04.869 --> 00:04:04.879 
stay basically the same from level to

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:06.880 
stay basically the same from level to
level<00:04:04.910> there's<00:04:05.450> not<00:04:05.599> much<00:04:05.780> variation<00:04:06.019> and

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:06.890 
level there's not much variation and

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:08.440 
level there's not much variation and
eventually<00:04:07.340> those<00:04:07.519> backgrounds<00:04:08.090> start<00:04:08.329> to

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:08.450 
eventually those backgrounds start to

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:10.479 
eventually those backgrounds start to
repeat<00:04:08.750> too<00:04:09.019> so<00:04:09.349> yeah<00:04:10.010> without<00:04:10.220> the

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:10.489 
repeat too so yeah without the

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:12.789 
repeat too so yeah without the
multiplayer<00:04:10.970> elements<00:04:11.480> so<00:04:11.930> form<00:04:12.230> isn't<00:04:12.560> quite

00:04:12.789 --> 00:04:12.799 
multiplayer elements so form isn't quite

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:16.930 
multiplayer elements so form isn't quite
as<00:04:13.150> well<00:04:14.150> it's<00:04:14.810> not<00:04:14.900> quite<00:04:15.140> a<00:04:15.170> silkworm<00:04:15.940> look

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:16.940 
as well it's not quite a silkworm look

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:19.000 
as well it's not quite a silkworm look
