00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:23.560 
okay so let's look at the examples the

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.540 
okay so let's look at the examples the
first<00:00:23.769> one<00:00:23.949> is<00:00:24.750> ok<00:00:25.750> this<00:00:25.929> is<00:00:26.080> the<00:00:26.550> core

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:27.550 
first one is ok this is the core

mass M there are many ways to make a
negative<00:00:44.260> sentence<00:00:44.770> but<00:00:45.340> so<00:00:45.580> far<00:00:45.820> we<00:00:46.060> be

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:46.240 
negative sentence but so far we be

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:50.970 
negative sentence but so far we be
learned<00:00:46.510> a<00:00:47.940> speech<00:00:48.940> a<00:00:49.300> speech<00:00:49.500> pattern<00:00:50.500> it's

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:50.980 
learned a speech a speech pattern it's

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:56.400 
learned a speech a speech pattern it's
either<00:00:51.960> instead<00:00:52.960> su<00:00:53.260> re<00:00:53.740> masu<00:00:54.430> imasu<00:00:55.330> so<00:00:55.990> let's

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:56.410 
either instead su re masu imasu so let's

00:00:56.410 --> 00:01:02.400 
either instead su re masu imasu so let's
just<00:00:57.330> memorize<00:00:58.330> all<00:00:58.660> the<00:00:59.310> form<00:01:00.310> changes<00:01:00.730> ok<00:01:01.690> so

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:02.410 
just memorize all the form changes ok so

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.840 
just memorize all the form changes ok so
repeat<00:01:03.250> after<00:01:03.280> me<00:01:03.610> what<00:01:04.420> does<00:01:04.659> you<00:01:04.900> up<00:01:05.850> yadira

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:06.850 
repeat after me what does you up yadira

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:24.070 
denial and I have another example using

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:28.260 
denial and I have another example using
there<00:01:24.310> is<00:01:24.550> there<00:01:24.880> are<00:01:25.560> let's<00:01:26.560> say<00:01:26.650> it<00:01:27.310> was<00:01:27.610> a

00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:28.270 
there is there are let's say it was a

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:31.710 
there is there are let's say it was a
cool<00:01:28.840> umaga<00:01:29.430> ademas<00:01:30.430> that<00:01:31.090> was<00:01:31.210> there<00:01:31.510> is<00:01:31.690> a

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:31.720 
cool umaga ademas that was there is a

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.719 
cool umaga ademas that was there is a
car<00:01:32.140> and<00:01:32.470> now<00:01:33.310> you<00:01:33.760> say<00:01:34.000> there<00:01:34.270> isn't<00:01:34.540> a<00:01:34.870> car

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:35.729 
car and now you say there isn't a car

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:41.850 
car and now you say there isn't a car
you<00:01:36.729> say<00:01:36.970> kuru<00:01:37.330> maaga<00:01:37.810> re<00:01:38.680> misson<00:01:40.590> it's<00:01:41.590> very

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:41.860 
you say kuru maaga re misson it's very

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:44.370 
you say kuru maaga re misson it's very
similar<00:01:42.159> you<00:01:42.520> use<00:01:42.909> edema<00:01:43.420> send<00:01:43.690> both<00:01:44.020> times

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 
similar you use edema send both times

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.640 
similar you use edema send both times
and<00:01:44.850> actually<00:01:45.850> when<00:01:46.299> you<00:01:46.360> use<00:01:46.570> a<00:01:46.810> muscle<00:01:47.380> it's

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:47.650 
and actually when you use a muscle it's

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:51.149 
and actually when you use a muscle it's
the<00:01:47.979> same<00:01:48.340> change<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.960> support<00:01:50.590> chains<00:01:50.979> a

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:51.159 
the same change the support chains a

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:55.200 
the same change the support chains a
must<00:01:51.520> sin<00:01:52.170> so<00:01:53.170> this<00:01:53.470> as<00:01:53.680> M<00:01:54.070> part<00:01:54.610> is<00:01:54.850> the<00:01:55.030> denial

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.210 
must sin so this as M part is the denial

00:01:55.210 --> 00:02:01.980 
must sin so this as M part is the denial
and<00:01:56.549> also<00:01:57.600> there's<00:01:58.740> we<00:01:59.740> only<00:02:00.040> use<00:02:00.369> the<00:02:00.790> verb<00:02:01.659> is

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:01.990 
and also there's we only use the verb is

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:07.260 
and also there's we only use the verb is
M<00:02:02.560> are<00:02:03.810> in<00:02:04.810> English<00:02:05.290> so<00:02:05.820> we're<00:02:06.820> going<00:02:06.909> to<00:02:07.030> get

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
M are in English so we're going to get

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.499 
M are in English so we're going to get
into<00:02:07.510> the<00:02:07.630> verb<00:02:07.840> then<00:02:08.140> we<00:02:08.409> learn<00:02:08.679> a<00:02:08.950> more

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
into the verb then we learn a more

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:12.569 
into the verb then we learn a more
denials<00:02:10.509> but<00:02:10.749> so<00:02:10.989> far<00:02:11.230> this<00:02:11.799> is<00:02:12.010> the<00:02:12.040> form<00:02:12.430> you

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:12.579 
denials but so far this is the form you

00:02:12.579 --> 00:02:21.309 
denials but so far this is the form you
have<00:02:12.609> to<00:02:12.819> know

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319 

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:23.379 

you
