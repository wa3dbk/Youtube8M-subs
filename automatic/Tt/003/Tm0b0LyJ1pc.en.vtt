all<00:00:01.560> right<00:00:01.770> with<00:00:01.890> the<00:00:01.979> seeing<00:00:02.190> here<00:00:02.370> was<00:00:02.520> the

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:03.410 
all right with the seeing here was the

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:08.780 
all right with the seeing here was the
circuit<00:00:05.150> and<00:00:06.150> that<00:00:06.299> took<00:00:06.450> the<00:00:06.540> truck<00:00:07.080> I<00:00:07.790> got

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:08.790 
circuit and that took the truck I got

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.379 
circuit and that took the truck I got
the<00:00:09.800> Blair

00:00:11.379 --> 00:00:11.389 
the Blair

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:16.750 
the Blair
speed<00:00:12.389> controlled<00:00:14.059> with<00:00:15.059> the<00:00:15.560> 1/8<00:00:16.560> scale

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:16.760 
speed controlled with the 1/8 scale

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:22.310 
speed controlled with the 1/8 scale
torque<00:00:17.760> a<00:00:18.029> Chad<00:00:18.539> torque<00:00:18.810> motor<00:00:19.730> and<00:00:21.170> I've<00:00:22.170> been

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
torque a Chad torque motor and I've been

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:30.370 
torque a Chad torque motor and I've been
I've<00:00:23.130> been<00:00:23.310> messing<00:00:23.609> around<00:00:23.789> I<00:00:28.189> got<00:00:29.189> some

00:00:30.370 --> 00:00:30.380 
I've been messing around I got some

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:35.830 
I've been messing around I got some
weights<00:00:31.380> in<00:00:31.830> the<00:00:32.520> shelves<00:00:32.940> so<00:00:33.000> that<00:00:33.120> the<00:00:34.610> the

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:35.840 
weights in the shelves so that the the

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:39.500 
weights in the shelves so that the the
car<00:00:36.840> doesn't<00:00:37.110> really<00:00:37.260> pop<00:00:37.469> a<00:00:37.530> wheelie<00:00:37.770> I<00:00:38.510> don't

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
car doesn't really pop a wheelie I don't

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.299 
car doesn't really pop a wheelie I don't
really<00:00:39.660> see<00:00:39.930> anywhere<00:00:40.320> on<00:00:40.440> here<00:00:40.649> to<00:00:40.860> put<00:00:41.070> any

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
really see anywhere on here to put any

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.520 
really see anywhere on here to put any
you<00:00:41.760> know<00:00:41.910> on<00:00:42.059> the<00:00:42.180> Rustler<00:00:42.510> there's<00:00:42.690> a<00:00:42.780> it's

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
you know on the Rustler there's a it's

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.040 
you know on the Rustler there's a it's
flat<00:00:43.829> right<00:00:44.040> there<00:00:44.250> so<00:00:44.430> you<00:00:44.489> can<00:00:44.640> put<00:00:44.670> it

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:45.050 
flat right there so you can put it

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:49.250 
flat right there so you can put it
anywhere<00:00:46.670> but<00:00:47.670> of<00:00:47.850> Serket<00:00:48.719> trucks<00:00:48.930> kind<00:00:49.200> of

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260 
anywhere but of Serket trucks kind of

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.510 
anywhere but of Serket trucks kind of
flat<00:00:49.440> so<00:00:49.649> you<00:00:49.680> can't<00:00:49.920> really<00:00:50.039> put<00:00:50.250> it<00:00:50.309> anywhere

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:50.520 
flat so you can't really put it anywhere

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.970 
flat so you can't really put it anywhere
so<00:00:50.730> I<00:00:50.789> just<00:00:50.910> put<00:00:51.090> them<00:00:51.149> in<00:00:51.270> here<00:00:51.449> so<00:00:51.829> I'm<00:00:52.829> about

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:52.980 
so I just put them in here so I'm about

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.900 
so I just put them in here so I'm about
to<00:00:53.100> do<00:00:53.280> a<00:00:53.309> little<00:00:55.489> throttling<00:00:56.489> to<00:00:56.670> show<00:00:56.850> you

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
to do a little throttling to show you

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:05.750 
to do a little throttling to show you
the<00:00:57.059> blending<00:00:57.360> of<00:00:57.539> the<00:00:57.600> tires<00:01:03.890> all<00:01:04.890> righty

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
the blending of the tires all righty

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:19.420 
the blending of the tires all righty
here<00:01:06.150> we<00:01:06.210> go

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:19.430 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.630 

and<00:01:19.910> that's<00:01:20.090> just<00:01:20.270> use<00:01:20.420> a<00:01:21.070> regular<00:01:22.070> batteries

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:22.640 
and that's just use a regular batteries

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.300 
and that's just use a regular batteries
not<00:01:22.820> lipo<00:01:23.210> batteries<00:01:23.690> so<00:01:23.930> I<00:01:24.200> got<00:01:24.980> to<00:01:25.070> get<00:01:25.160> some

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
not lipo batteries so I got to get some

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:26.890 
not lipo batteries so I got to get some
lipo<00:01:25.640> batteries<00:01:26.030> to<00:01:26.150> see<00:01:26.300> how<00:01:26.390> fast<00:01:26.660> it<00:01:26.810> goes

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:26.900 
lipo batteries to see how fast it goes

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:32.760 
lipo batteries to see how fast it goes
but<00:01:27.140> I<00:01:27.200> do<00:01:27.320> have<00:01:27.790> on<00:01:30.310> the<00:01:31.310> gear<00:01:31.580> side<00:01:31.610> I<00:01:31.970> got<00:01:32.330> a

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 
but I do have on the gear side I got a

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.910 
but I do have on the gear side I got a
camera<00:01:33.770> to<00:01:33.980> see<00:01:34.160> cuz<00:01:34.430> it's<00:01:34.580> dark<00:01:35.320> but<00:01:36.320> that<00:01:36.620> is

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:36.920 
camera to see cuz it's dark but that is

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:44.340 
camera to see cuz it's dark but that is
a<00:01:37.450> mod<00:01:38.450> one<00:01:39.760> pinion<00:01:40.760> and<00:01:41.170> that<00:01:42.170> is<00:01:42.350> a<00:01:42.380> 36<00:01:43.010> tooth

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.350 
a mod one pinion and that is a 36 tooth

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:50.740 
a mod one pinion and that is a 36 tooth
spur<00:01:45.350> gear<00:01:46.120> and<00:01:48.730> it's<00:01:49.730> pretty<00:01:49.970> fast<00:01:50.270> but<00:01:50.600> it's

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:50.750 
spur gear and it's pretty fast but it's

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:52.810 
spur gear and it's pretty fast but it's
raining<00:01:51.050> outside<00:01:51.200> right<00:01:51.650> now<00:01:51.680> that<00:01:52.040> I'm

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:52.820 
raining outside right now that I'm

00:01:52.820 --> 00:02:03.209 
raining outside right now that I'm
running<00:01:52.940> rain<00:01:54.220> but<00:01:55.220> you<00:01:55.580> can<00:01:55.700> shake<00:01:55.910> it<00:01:55.940> out

00:02:03.209 --> 00:02:03.219 

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:08.279 

you're<00:02:03.729> not<00:02:03.909> playing<00:02:04.390> around<00:02:05.729> so<00:02:07.140> maybe<00:02:08.140> later

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289 
you're not playing around so maybe later

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:09.900 
you're not playing around so maybe later
I'll<00:02:08.530> do<00:02:08.709> some<00:02:08.860> videos<00:02:09.190> let<00:02:09.369> me<00:02:09.459> run<00:02:09.610> down<00:02:09.789> the

00:02:09.900 --> 00:02:09.910 
I'll do some videos let me run down the

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:13.289 
I'll do some videos let me run down the
street<00:02:10.860> hopefully<00:02:11.860> by<00:02:12.670> the<00:02:12.730> time<00:02:12.819> I<00:02:13.060> do<00:02:13.120> the

00:02:13.289 --> 00:02:13.299 
street hopefully by the time I do the

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:17.130 
street hopefully by the time I do the
videos<00:02:13.569> there'll<00:02:13.959> be<00:02:13.989> some<00:02:15.420> the<00:02:16.420> lipo

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:17.140 
videos there'll be some the lipo

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:18.630 
videos there'll be some the lipo
batteries<00:02:17.500> in<00:02:17.620> there<00:02:17.769> said<00:02:18.040> this<00:02:18.220> irregular

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
batteries in there said this irregular

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:24.269 
batteries in there said this irregular
better<00:02:18.819> so<00:02:19.120> we'll<00:02:19.569> see<00:02:20.640> I'll<00:02:21.640> at<00:02:21.879> you<00:02:22.060> later
