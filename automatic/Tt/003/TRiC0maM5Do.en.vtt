00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.390 
down and then this is kind of where you
could<00:02:33.960> do<00:02:34.080> whatever<00:02:34.230> you<00:02:34.440> want<00:02:34.710> but<00:02:34.890> I<00:02:34.920> think<00:02:35.280> I

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:35.400 
could do whatever you want but I think I

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:41.800 
could do whatever you want but I think I
do<00:02:35.459> like<00:02:35.760> down<00:02:36.090> down<00:02:36.959> up<00:02:37.200> up<00:02:37.470> down<00:02:37.650> so

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:43.840 

and<00:02:42.350> then<00:02:42.560> you<00:02:42.890> slide<00:02:43.190> up<00:02:43.430> and<00:02:43.640> do<00:02:43.700> the<00:02:43.819> same

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:43.850 
and then you slide up and do the same

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:47.540 
and then you slide up and do the same
thing

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.010 

and<00:02:47.910> then<00:02:48.030> slide<00:02:48.270> back<00:02:48.300> down<00:02:48.660> and<00:02:48.900> you<00:02:48.990> just

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:49.020 
and then slide back down and you just

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:51.380 
and then slide back down and you just
alternate<00:02:49.590> back<00:02:49.770> and<00:02:49.800> forth<00:02:50.010> so<00:02:50.820> then<00:02:51.000> you<00:02:51.270> get

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390 
alternate back and forth so then you get

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:52.550 
alternate back and forth so then you get
to<00:02:51.480> the<00:02:51.570> part<00:02:51.720> where<00:02:51.780> it<00:02:51.900> kind<00:02:52.050> of<00:02:52.140> slows<00:02:52.320> down

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
to the part where it kind of slows down

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.200 
to the part where it kind of slows down
for<00:02:52.950> the<00:02:53.010> pre-chorus<00:02:53.400> and<00:02:53.700> you're<00:02:54.030> just

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:54.210 
for the pre-chorus and you're just

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:56.870 
for the pre-chorus and you're just
strumming<00:02:54.920> once<00:02:55.920> and<00:02:56.280> then<00:02:56.490> you<00:02:56.640> hit<00:02:56.790> the

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
strumming once and then you hit the

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.310 
strumming once and then you hit the
guitar<00:02:57.000> four<00:02:57.660> times<00:02:57.870> like<00:02:58.080> right<00:02:58.230> here<00:02:58.440> and

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:00.320 
guitar four times like right here and

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:04.550 
guitar four times like right here and
then<00:03:01.320> up<00:03:01.950> to<00:03:02.010> the<00:03:02.730> second<00:03:03.060> fret<00:03:03.240> and<00:03:03.560> strum

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:04.560 
then up to the second fret and strum

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.010 
then up to the second fret and strum
ones<00:03:04.830> and<00:03:05.070> then<00:03:05.160> one<00:03:05.490> two<00:03:06.360> you<00:03:06.780> could<00:03:06.900> do<00:03:06.990> a

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:07.020 
ones and then one two you could do a

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.840 
ones and then one two you could do a
third<00:03:07.320> and<00:03:07.650> then<00:03:07.770> I<00:03:07.950> kind<00:03:08.220> of<00:03:08.280> just<00:03:08.340> do<00:03:08.580> down

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:08.850 
third and then I kind of just do down

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.150 
third and then I kind of just do down
and<00:03:09.060> down<00:03:09.300> up<00:03:09.600> and<00:03:10.290> then<00:03:10.320> you're<00:03:10.980> at<00:03:11.070> the

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:11.160 
and down up and then you're at the

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.100 
and down up and then you're at the
chorus<00:03:11.550> and<00:03:11.820> this<00:03:12.270> is<00:03:12.420> the<00:03:12.540> only<00:03:12.690> time<00:03:12.930> you're

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 
chorus and this is the only time you're

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:14.540 
chorus and this is the only time you're
using<00:03:13.140> like<00:03:13.440> a<00:03:13.530> full-on<00:03:13.710> strumming<00:03:14.250> pattern

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:14.550 
using like a full-on strumming pattern

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:16.250 
using like a full-on strumming pattern
so<00:03:14.970> the<00:03:15.180> strumming<00:03:15.480> pattern<00:03:15.540> for<00:03:15.960> the<00:03:16.020> chorus

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:16.260 
so the strumming pattern for the chorus

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.980 
so the strumming pattern for the chorus
is<00:03:16.440> down<00:03:16.740> down<00:03:17.190> up<00:03:17.220> up<00:03:17.610> down<00:03:17.940> up<00:03:18.000> up<00:03:18.240> down<00:03:18.720> up<00:03:18.780> up

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:18.990 
is down down up up down up up down up up

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:23.300 
is down down up up down up up down up up
down<00:03:19.530> up<00:03:19.800> down<00:03:19.830> down<00:03:20.310> up<00:03:22.160> and<00:03:23.160> you're<00:03:23.280> just

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
down up down down up and you're just

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.770 
down up down down up and you're just
switching<00:03:24.270> back<00:03:24.390> and<00:03:24.450> forth<00:03:24.630> every<00:03:25.400> four

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:26.780 
switching back and forth every four

00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:29.750 
switching back and forth every four
downbeats<00:03:27.780> kind<00:03:28.230> of<00:03:28.410> I<00:03:28.680> don't<00:03:29.250> know<00:03:29.340> that

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
downbeats kind of I don't know that

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.180 
downbeats kind of I don't know that
probably<00:03:30.030> made<00:03:30.210> no<00:03:30.330> sense<00:03:30.540> but<00:03:31.020> you<00:03:31.650> like<00:03:32.040> you
