You never told me you could leave and never look back 

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:29.840
Another year is dead this town is still thinking of you

00:00:30.556 --> 00:00:35.296
I wanna get out and live another day with you now

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.460
Just spend the day in the sun, night falls, we'll hit the town

00:00:41.093 --> 00:00:45.093
Then bring back the sunshine!

00:00:45.095 --> 00:00:51.235
Have you ever felt something that makes you feel the world spin round so fast? 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:56.500
Have you ever held on to a dream? Well hold this one close cos it might just be your last

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:02.460
Have you ever cried so hard that you can't see tomorrow through the tears?

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:08.840
Move in slowly so that you can see that this world's for you 
Yeah you know this is all for you!

Leave all the fear behind I'm not afraid any more... woah

I wanna get out and leave another day in the clouds 

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:40.140
Just spend my life in this haze and never ever come down

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:44.680
Just bring back the good times!
