I'm<00:01:59.009> wrong<00:02:00.500> it's<00:02:01.500> really<00:02:01.710> powerful<00:02:02.040> like<00:02:02.250> it

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
I'm wrong it's really powerful like it

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:05.929 
I'm wrong it's really powerful like it
wasn't<00:02:02.640> the<00:02:02.990> on-call<00:02:03.990> duty<00:02:04.140> for<00:02:04.759> all<00:02:05.759> those<00:02:05.880> a

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
wasn't the on-call duty for all those a

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.429 
wasn't the on-call duty for all those a
lot<00:02:06.180> easier<00:02:06.270> to<00:02:06.509> control<00:02:06.689> on<00:02:06.990> this<00:02:07.140> and<00:02:07.350> my

00:02:07.429 --> 00:02:07.439 
lot easier to control on this and my

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:12.880 
lot easier to control on this and my
opinion<00:02:10.670> personally

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
opinion personally

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.160 
opinion personally
I<00:02:12.980> think<00:02:13.850> I'd<00:02:14.000> probably<00:02:14.270> stick<00:02:14.630> with<00:02:14.660> the<00:02:14.840> scar

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:15.170 
I think I'd probably stick with the scar

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:20.350 
I think I'd probably stick with the scar
but<00:02:16.690> this<00:02:17.690> this<00:02:18.470> is<00:02:18.530> probably<00:02:18.920> I<00:02:19.340> guess<00:02:20.209> a<00:02:20.240> bit

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:20.360 
but this this is probably I guess a bit

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.620 
but this this is probably I guess a bit
more<00:02:20.660> reliable<00:02:21.670> I'd<00:02:22.670> say<00:02:22.880> less<00:02:23.120> powerful<00:02:23.420> than

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:23.630 
more reliable I'd say less powerful than

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.340 
more reliable I'd say less powerful than

damage<00:02:28.970> that<00:02:29.180> so<00:02:29.300> I<00:02:29.330> have<00:02:29.420> no<00:02:29.570> idea<00:02:29.840> because<00:02:29.930> I

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
damage that so I have no idea because I

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.070 
damage that so I have no idea because I
haven't<00:02:30.260> read<00:02:30.500> anything<00:02:30.770> but<00:02:31.420> to<00:02:32.420> me<00:02:32.570> it<00:02:32.780> seems

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
haven't read anything but to me it seems

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:36.250 
haven't read anything but to me it seems
