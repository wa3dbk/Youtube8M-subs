00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.930 

okay<00:03:45.000> like<00:03:45.600> if<00:03:45.960> anything<00:03:46.650> like<00:03:47.160> if<00:03:47.400> you<00:03:47.730> wanted

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:49.290 
to use this weapon I'd recommend

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:50.930 
to use this weapon I'd recommend
probably<00:03:50.130> using<00:03:50.340> it<00:03:50.400> with<00:03:50.520> the<00:03:50.580> Huntsman

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:50.940 
probably using it with the Huntsman

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:52.370 
probably using it with the Huntsman
because<00:03:51.180> the<00:03:51.360> Huntsman<00:03:51.660> is<00:03:51.780> more<00:03:51.990> of<00:03:52.050> a<00:03:52.110> front

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:52.380 
because the Huntsman is more of a front

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.250 
because the Huntsman is more of a front
nine<00:03:52.770> weapon<00:03:53.550> than<00:03:53.910> the<00:03:54.030> default<00:03:54.600> sniper<00:03:54.990> for

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
nine weapon than the default sniper for

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.010 
nine weapon than the default sniper for

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:27.920 
flying speed and the no random critical

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:32.500 
flying speed and the no random critical
hits<00:05:29.830> which<00:05:30.830> are<00:05:31.130> basically<00:05:31.400> making<00:05:32.360> this

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:32.510 
hits which are basically making this

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:34.570 
hits which are basically making this
weapon<00:05:32.810> shoot<00:05:32.990> at<00:05:33.200> a<00:05:33.350> very<00:05:33.500> slower<00:05:33.770> speed<00:05:34.190> with

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:34.580 
weapon shoot at a very slower speed with

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:38.950 
weapon shoot at a very slower speed with
a<00:05:34.610> very<00:05:36.340> not<00:05:37.340> very<00:05:37.370> small<00:05:38.030> clip<00:05:38.540> size<00:05:38.720> it's

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:38.960 
a very not very small clip size it's

00:05:38.960 --> 00:05:45.010 
a very not very small clip size it's
just<00:05:39.110> a<00:05:39.340> like<00:05:40.340> five<00:05:40.520> less<00:05:41.360> bullets<00:05:41.720> um<00:05:44.020> which

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:45.020 
just a like five less bullets um which

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:47.050 
just a like five less bullets um which
basically<00:05:45.290> make<00:05:45.590> this<00:05:45.710> weapon<00:05:46.010> shoot<00:05:46.160> as<00:05:46.340> long

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:47.060 
basically make this weapon shoot as long

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:48.700 
basically make this weapon shoot as long
as<00:05:47.090> the<00:05:47.360> default<00:05:47.510> SMG<00:05:47.960> but<00:05:48.170> it's<00:05:48.260> not<00:05:48.410> tuning

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:48.710 
as the default SMG but it's not tuning

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:50.950 
as the default SMG but it's not tuning
as<00:05:48.800> much<00:05:48.950> bullets<00:05:49.370> and<00:05:49.640> not<00:05:50.510> as<00:05:50.600> much<00:05:50.690> damage

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:50.960 
as much bullets and not as much damage

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:54.430 
as much bullets and not as much damage
so<00:05:51.560> this<00:05:51.800> weapon<00:05:52.270> by<00:05:53.270> default<00:05:53.570> basically

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:54.440 
so this weapon by default basically

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:57.610 
so this weapon by default basically
doesn't<00:05:54.920> do<00:05:55.190> very<00:05:55.340> much<00:05:55.490> damage<00:05:55.910> like<00:05:56.620> not

00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:57.620 
doesn't do very much damage like not

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:59.260 
doesn't do very much damage like not
much<00:05:57.800> damage<00:05:58.100> at<00:05:58.220> all<00:05:58.310> and<00:05:58.580> with<00:05:58.790> the<00:05:58.880> crits<00:05:59.120> on

00:05:59.260 --> 00:05:59.270 
much damage at all and with the crits on

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:01.210 
much damage at all and with the crits on
top<00:05:59.420> of<00:05:59.540> that<00:05:59.690> it's<00:05:59.960> still<00:06:00.680> not<00:06:00.830> very<00:06:01.040> much

00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:01.220 
top of that it's still not very much

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:04.180 
top of that it's still not very much
damage<00:06:01.640> like<00:06:01.940> it<00:06:02.450> still<00:06:03.290> can<00:06:03.470> do<00:06:03.560> damage<00:06:03.800> but

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:04.190 
damage like it still can do damage but

00:06:04.190 --> 00:06:07.180 
damage like it still can do damage but
