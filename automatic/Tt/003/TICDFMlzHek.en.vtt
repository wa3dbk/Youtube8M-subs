00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.800 
tries see how fast I can do it alright
so<00:01:50.100> I'm<00:01:50.159> going<00:01:50.280> to<00:01:50.340> attempt<00:01:51.119> this<00:01:51.299> will<00:01:51.600> try

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
so I'm going to attempt this will try

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.749 
so I'm going to attempt this will try
three<00:01:52.079> times<00:01:52.290> like<00:01:52.500> you<00:01:52.619> did<00:01:52.799> again<00:01:53.490> I'm<00:01:53.729> using

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
three times like you did again I'm using

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.690 
three times like you did again I'm using
a<00:01:54.299> manual<00:01:54.600> knife<00:01:54.990> and<00:01:55.320> it's<00:01:56.130> being<00:01:56.399> deployed

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
a manual knife and it's being deployed

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:00.679 
a manual knife and it's being deployed
from<00:01:57.030> an<00:01:57.270> open-top<00:01:58.490> sheath<00:01:59.490> I<00:01:59.790> think<00:02:00.479> this<00:02:00.600> is

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
from an open-top sheath I think this is

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.539 
from an open-top sheath I think this is
going<00:02:00.780> to<00:02:00.840> have<00:02:00.960> less<00:02:01.110> retention<00:02:01.770> then<00:02:02.280> a

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
going to have less retention then a

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.609 
going to have less retention then a
knife<00:02:02.759> clipped<00:02:03.149> your<00:02:03.270> pocket<00:02:03.689> so<00:02:04.140> it<00:02:04.170> kind<00:02:04.590> of

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
knife clipped your pocket so it kind of

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.020 
knife clipped your pocket so it kind of
offset<00:02:05.009> that<00:02:05.040> if<00:02:05.340> you<00:02:05.399> happen<00:02:05.640> I<00:02:05.700> think<00:02:05.729> that's

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
offset that if you happen I think that's

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.639 
offset that if you happen I think that's
an<00:02:06.119> advantage<00:02:06.270> which<00:02:06.869> I<00:02:07.020> happen<00:02:07.200> to<00:02:07.350> think<00:02:07.409> it

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649 
an advantage which I happen to think it

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.559 
an advantage which I happen to think it
is<00:02:07.680> instead<00:02:08.459> of<00:02:08.520> having<00:02:08.580> your<00:02:08.789> hands<00:02:09.119> draped

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:09.569 
is instead of having your hands draped

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:11.320 
is instead of having your hands draped
down<00:02:09.720> to<00:02:09.929> the<00:02:10.050> sides

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
down to the sides

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.360 
down to the sides
and<00:02:11.450> going<00:02:11.750> from<00:02:11.990> here<00:02:12.260> to<00:02:12.350> here<00:02:12.770> to<00:02:13.100> grab<00:02:13.280> your

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
and going from here to here to grab your

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:14.830 
and going from here to here to grab your
knife<00:02:13.520> or<00:02:13.730> from<00:02:13.880> here<00:02:14.120> to<00:02:14.300> your<00:02:14.390> pocket<00:02:14.780> or

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:14.840 
knife or from here to your pocket or

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.590 
knife or from here to your pocket or
whatever<00:02:15.080> I'm<00:02:15.530> going<00:02:15.740> to<00:02:15.800> cross<00:02:16.010> my<00:02:16.250> arms<00:02:16.540> so<00:02:17.540> I

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:17.600 
whatever I'm going to cross my arms so I

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.960 
whatever I'm going to cross my arms so I
have<00:02:17.720> to<00:02:17.810> come<00:02:17.960> down<00:02:18.200> to<00:02:18.440> get<00:02:18.620> it<00:02:18.680> all<00:02:19.430> right<00:02:19.610> so

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
have to come down to get it all right so

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
have to come down to get it all right so
that<00:02:20.900> should<00:02:21.110> add<00:02:21.320> time<00:02:21.710> to<00:02:21.740> my<00:02:22.100> draw<00:02:22.750> but<00:02:23.750> just

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:23.990 
that should add time to my draw but just

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:26.320 
that should add time to my draw but just
having<00:02:24.170> some<00:02:24.320> fun<00:02:24.350> it's<00:02:25.250> no<00:02:25.400> real<00:02:25.640> prize<00:02:26.030> hear

again<00:03:06.680> you<00:03:07.280> get<00:03:07.430> faster<00:03:07.760> and<00:03:07.820> faster<00:03:07.910> but<00:03:08.660> you

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
again you get faster and faster but you

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:10.330 
again you get faster and faster but you
