with and it cannot be dealt with again
we<00:00:41.520> do<00:00:41.640> nothing<00:00:41.879> about<00:00:41.969> it<00:00:42.120> even<00:00:42.360> if<00:00:42.600> he<00:00:42.690> was

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
we do nothing about it even if he was

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.080 
we do nothing about it even if he was
wrong<00:00:43.170> are<00:00:43.469> they<00:00:43.590> infallible<00:00:44.280> lines<00:00:44.640> men<00:00:44.940> is

that<00:00:45.210> part<00:00:45.420> of<00:00:45.510> the<00:00:45.680> hope<00:00:46.680> yeah<00:00:47.160> that<00:00:47.520> the

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
that part of the hope yeah that the

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.970 
that part of the hope yeah that the
referee<00:00:48.059> didn't<00:00:48.360> see<00:00:48.390> but<00:00:48.690> one<00:00:48.930> guy<00:00:49.260> did<00:00:49.680> see

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980

referee didn't see but one guy did see
us<00:00:50.129> and<00:00:50.370> then<00:00:51.090> when<00:00:51.809> we've<00:00:52.050> seen<00:00:52.320> it<00:00:52.530> and<00:00:52.710> if<00:00:53.399> I

00:00:53.869 --> 00:00:53.879 
us and then when we've seen it and if I

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.150 
us and then when we've seen it and if I
didn't<00:00:54.120> act<00:00:54.239> in<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.480> moment<00:00:54.870> then<00:00:55.379> somehow<00:00:55.680> is

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
didn't act in the moment then somehow is

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.000 
didn't act in the moment then somehow is
that<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.809> rules<00:00:57.809> are<00:00:57.960> slightly<00:00:58.199> arcane<00:00:58.710> and

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
that the rules are slightly arcane and

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.209 
that the rules are slightly arcane and
the<00:00:59.250> fact<00:00:59.460> is<00:00:59.609> he<00:00:59.730> got<00:00:59.910> off<00:01:00.059> didn't<00:01:00.510> he<00:01:00.539> yeah

00:01:01.209 --> 00:01:01.219 
the fact is he got off didn't he yeah

00:01:01.219 --> 00:01:04.549 
the fact is he got off didn't he yeah
very<00:01:02.219> obviously<00:01:03.030> a<00:01:03.149> hideous<00:01:03.960> even<00:01:04.470> though

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559 
very obviously a hideous even though

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:07.990 
very obviously a hideous even though
we've<00:01:04.710> was<00:01:04.890> down<00:01:05.129> many<00:01:05.369> times<00:01:05.640> and<00:01:05.970> you<00:01:06.060> go

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
what about the concept of the fact that

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.020
