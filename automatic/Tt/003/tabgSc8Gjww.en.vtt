00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
kit and some basic tools first you by

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:21.470 
kit and some basic tools first you by
going<00:00:18.990> up<00:00:19.140> here<00:00:19.460> you<00:00:20.460> are<00:00:20.609> going<00:00:20.850> to<00:00:21.150> want<00:00:21.330> to

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:21.480 
going up here you are going to want to

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.830 
going up here you are going to want to
the<00:00:21.689> plumb<00:00:22.109> remove<00:00:23.100> the<00:00:23.939> negative<00:00:24.510> charge

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
the plumb remove the negative charge

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.630 
the plumb remove the negative charge
from<00:00:25.080> the<00:00:25.230> battery<00:00:25.260> so<00:00:26.250> it<00:00:26.310> doesn't

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:26.640 
from the battery so it doesn't

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:28.990 
from the battery so it doesn't
electrocute<00:00:27.090> you<00:00:27.269> and<00:00:27.539> I'll<00:00:28.170> be<00:00:28.289> right<00:00:28.470> back

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:29.000

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
so after you remove the negative charge

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.450 
so after you remove the negative charge
from<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.120> battery<00:00:33.260> you<00:00:34.260> want<00:00:34.410> to<00:00:34.680> remove<00:00:35.160> the

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
from the battery you want to remove the

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.580 
from the battery you want to remove the
air<00:00:35.730> compressor<00:00:36.300> lines<00:00:36.570> from<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.410> air

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
air compressor lines from the air

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.639 
air compressor lines from the air
compressor<00:00:38.129> itself<00:00:38.520> so<00:00:39.480> you<00:00:39.540> will<00:00:40.170> remove

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
compressor itself so you will remove

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:44.060 
compressor itself so you will remove
this<00:00:40.920> nut<00:00:41.160> and<00:00:41.489> then<00:00:42.050> this<00:00:43.050> bowl<00:00:43.379> and<00:00:43.649> then<00:00:43.950> it

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
this nut and then this bowl and then it

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.590 
this nut and then this bowl and then it
will<00:00:44.190> come<00:00:44.370> over<00:00:44.610> here<00:00:44.700> and<00:00:45.120> then<00:00:45.239> you<00:00:45.329> want<00:00:45.450> to

will come over here and then you want to
remove<00:00:45.930> the<00:00:46.320> serpentine<00:00:46.980> belt<00:00:47.780> and<00:00:48.780> we'll<00:00:49.680> be

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
remove the serpentine belt and we'll be

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:52.090 
remove the serpentine belt and we'll be
right<00:00:50.010> back<00:00:50.190> after<00:00:50.370> we<00:00:50.640> do<00:00:50.820> those<00:00:51.000> two<00:00:51.180> steps

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:52.100 
right back after we do those two steps

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.459 
right back after we do those two steps
so<00:00:53.100> now<00:00:53.129> that<00:00:53.340> you<00:00:53.640> have<00:00:53.820> removed<00:00:54.000> the<00:00:54.660> air

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
so now that you have removed the air

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:58.700 
so now that you have removed the air
compressor<00:00:56.070> tubes<00:00:56.340> on<00:00:57.300> and<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:58.020> serpentine

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
compressor tubes on and the serpentine

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:01.069 
compressor tubes on and the serpentine
belt<00:00:58.739> you<00:00:59.609> want<00:00:59.940> to<00:01:00.239> disconnect<00:01:00.870> the

belt you want to disconnect the

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.349 
belt you want to disconnect the
electrical<00:01:01.620> charge<00:01:01.920> right<00:01:02.160> here<00:01:02.219> from<00:01:03.180> these

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
electrical charge right here from these

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.469 
electrical charge right here from these
two<00:01:03.600> tabs<00:01:03.899> which<00:01:04.470> are<00:01:04.650> very<00:01:05.640> hard<00:01:05.939> to<00:01:06.030> remove

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
two tabs which are very hard to remove

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:09.109 
two tabs which are very hard to remove
and<00:01:06.780> then<00:01:07.350> you<00:01:07.439> want<00:01:07.650> to<00:01:07.860> unscrew<00:01:08.430> all<00:01:08.850> the

bolts these four bolts that are holding

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:15.140 
bolts these four bolts that are holding
it<00:01:12.479> down<00:01:12.720> onto<00:01:13.260> the<00:01:13.530> engine<00:01:13.830> and<00:01:14.250> we'll<00:01:15.030> be

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
it down onto the engine and we'll be

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.289 
it down onto the engine and we'll be
right<00:01:15.330> back<00:01:15.830> so<00:01:16.830> once<00:01:17.100> you<00:01:17.340> have<00:01:17.520> removed<00:01:17.790> to

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:18.299 
right back so once you have removed to

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.600 
right back so once you have removed to
d4<00:01:18.780> on<00:01:19.200> bullets<00:01:19.799> out<00:01:19.979> holding<00:01:20.280> it<00:01:20.460> your

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
d4 on bullets out holding it your

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.460 
d4 on bullets out holding it your
compressor<00:01:21.030> down<00:01:21.210> to<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.479> engine<00:01:21.840> you<00:01:22.320> want

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
compressor down to the engine you want

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.390 
compressor down to the engine you want
to<00:01:22.740> remove<00:01:23.130> it<00:01:23.490> by<00:01:24.090> lifting<00:01:24.350> the<00:01:25.350> top<00:01:25.560> and<00:01:26.189> just

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
to remove it by lifting the top and just

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.719 
to remove it by lifting the top and just
pulling<00:01:26.759> it<00:01:27.000> out<00:01:27.240> so<00:01:28.220> this<00:01:29.220> is<00:01:29.460> the<00:01:29.610> air

00:01:29.719 --> 00:01:29.729 
pulling it out so this is the air

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.310 
pulling it out so this is the air
compressor<00:01:30.299> this<00:01:30.450> is<00:01:30.509> where<00:01:30.780> the<00:01:30.869> belt<00:01:31.079> goes

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320 
compressor this is where the belt goes

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:37.550 
compressor this is where the belt goes
and<00:01:31.710> this<00:01:32.460> is<00:01:33.000> where<00:01:33.270> on<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:34.140> two<00:01:34.350> um<00:01:36.560> air

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
and this is where on the two um air

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.620 
and this is where on the two um air
compressor<00:01:38.070> tubes<00:01:38.310> go<00:01:38.610> to<00:01:39.000> fit<00:01:39.180> in<00:01:39.329> and

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
compressor tubes go to fit in and

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.510 
compressor tubes go to fit in and
there's<00:01:40.049> some<00:01:40.560> liquid<00:01:40.740> in<00:01:41.009> there<00:01:41.220> if<00:01:41.310> you<00:01:41.490> can

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
there's some liquid in there if you can

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.740 
there's some liquid in there if you can
like<00:01:42.000> see<00:01:42.780> but<00:01:43.259> okay<00:01:44.070> so<00:01:44.610> we'll<00:01:45.060> be<00:01:45.210> back<00:01:45.420> after

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:48.620 
we get the new one

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:52.660 
we get the new one

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:55.490 
the part store gave us the wrong air

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.540 
the part store gave us the wrong air
compressor<00:01:56.120> so<00:01:57.040> unfortunately<00:01:58.040> we<00:01:58.250> can't

00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:58.550 
compressor so unfortunately we can't

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 
through it so it's a sensitive core so

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:20.440 
through it so it's a sensitive core so
you<00:02:19.130> don't<00:02:19.310> want<00:02:19.430> to<00:02:19.490> put<00:02:19.610> it<00:02:19.700> down<00:02:19.790> that's

certified mechanic and get the system

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:22.360 
certified mechanic and get the system
charged<00:04:20.989> which<00:04:21.590> means<00:04:21.889> they're<00:04:22.070> putting

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:22.370 
charged which means they're putting

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:24.550 
charged which means they're putting
freon<00:04:22.789> in<00:04:22.940> the<00:04:23.060> system<00:04:23.509> which<00:04:24.050> will<00:04:24.229> make<00:04:24.410> the

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:24.560 
freon in the system which will make the

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:27.010 
freon in the system which will make the
