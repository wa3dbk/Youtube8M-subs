00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:55.580 
was thinking is like the communion

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:57.160 
was thinking is like the communion
that's<00:00:55.939> why<00:00:56.119> we<00:00:56.239> drink<00:00:56.420> wine<00:00:56.659> it's<00:00:56.989> like

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.170 
that's why we drink wine it's like

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.200 
that's why we drink wine it's like
drinking<00:00:57.860> his<00:00:58.040> blood<00:00:58.189> and<00:00:58.460> like<00:00:58.610> ingesting

00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.210 
drinking his blood and like ingesting

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.230 
drinking his blood and like ingesting
him<00:00:59.449> and<00:00:59.869> like<00:01:00.439> having<00:01:01.220> our<00:01:01.309> body<00:01:01.580> run<00:01:01.850> off

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:02.240 
him and like having our body run off

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:04.600 
him and like having our body run off
that<00:01:02.360> when<00:01:03.320> we<00:01:03.350> start<00:01:03.680> following<00:01:03.800> Jesus<00:01:04.040> and

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:04.610 
that when we start following Jesus and

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:06.790 
that when we start following Jesus and
like<00:01:04.790> our<00:01:05.030> blood<00:01:05.300> becomes<00:01:05.780> like<00:01:06.050> the<00:01:06.560> wine

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:06.800
