00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:10.490
 milan polytechnic's laboratory of artificial intelligence and robotics Ã¨ 

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:15.660
 was founded in 1973 by professor marco sommantico one of the pioneers of the 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.939
 artificial intelligence contacts 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:21.230
 then carried out its support activity 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:22.939
 to search 

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:26.880
 aruba technology transfer and teaching in the field of intelligence 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:29.069
 artificial and ham 

00:00:29.069 --> 00:00:33.440
 dozens of robots have been developed within the laboratory 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.720
 been used for scientific purposes excel 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.590
 I think of training in Ferrara 

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:41.280
 now hundreds of students 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.810
 laboratory also supports a large amount of level research 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:47.010
 international with 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.010
 funding mainly in the European community 

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.130
 research 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:54.530
 information 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.740
 international card industries 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:59.200
 and also basic research 

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:03.560
 research activities concern such aspects 

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.480
 diesel jeans official fz1 

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:10.300
 particularly in the field of provincial systems developer science 

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.730
 oh God. but cheer 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:16.730
 knowledge of sustainability 

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:19.820
 intelligent 

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.540
 the face of the saint in health 

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:26.210
 he is called lovers friends with whom he interprets 

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:28.830
 trust you are present 

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:33.020
 other activities concern different species of donkey replacement room 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.990
 robot 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.360
 that eyes from building robots 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.360
 euro extranet intelligence of 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:45.210
 such realization of recent times an autonomous wheelchair able again 

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:46.450
 set us up 

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:47.670
 a space 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:51.690
 that support the movement led by a person having problems 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:55.780
 contact problems that can range from simple hair 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:57.370
 15 you schoolgirl 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:59.520
 final situation 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.750
 complete block cases where 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:06.460
 life system goes through the final knives electroencephalography 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:09.179
 teach the whole plant. knowing 

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.209
 the person able without moving and indicate the wheelchair. 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:14.619
 bring it up 

00:02:14.619 --> 00:02:17.339
 among other applications we have systems 

00:02:17.339 --> 00:02:19.129
 sometimes in the context of 

00:02:19.129 --> 00:02:21.189
 European projects including 

00:02:21.189 --> 00:02:25.859
 system able to collect large amounts of data and then drive 

00:02:25.859 --> 00:02:27.509
 become localized 

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:30.479
 facing some of the documents he would do 

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:31.929
 robotic car radio 

00:02:31.929 --> 00:02:34.929
 product must be mounted on the bottom of the all-fire fire 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:42.460
 another line of research to get rid of developments, forgotten robotics 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:46.790
 in which inspiration is found from the private attachment to develop 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:48.309
 Verona 8 standard bearers 

00:02:48.309 --> 00:02:51.309
 can have gods 

00:02:52.189 --> 00:02:54.539
 new wardrobe itself 

00:02:54.539 --> 00:02:57.789
 return to fiducial form 

00:02:57.789 --> 00:03:00.789
 I also counted a lot of problems related to channels 

00:03:01.989 --> 00:03:06.390
 already artificial that requires interpretation of images that come from 

00:03:06.389 --> 00:03:07.639
 from camera 

00:03:07.639 --> 00:03:12.460
 that for example really 2 projects on earth are used 

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:13.849
 to evaluate 

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:17.599
 the positions of the objects certainly recognize them 

00:03:19.379 --> 00:03:22.089
 the movement of people and cars 

00:03:22.089 --> 00:03:26.439
 the external space maybe not sweetened and once again cooked open 

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:29.079
 to locate 

00:03:29.079 --> 00:03:31.480
 the dynasty from which we also mention 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:36.110
 at the robot actor initiative that plans to have robot teams is in 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:38.539
 able to play soccer 

00:03:38.539 --> 00:03:41.329
 pieces of without any human intervention 

00:03:41.329 --> 00:03:42.580
 this is one of mine 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:46.830
 perhaps more difficult tasks that you can carry cars at this time 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:48.469
 while drowning 50 we have 

00:03:48.469 --> 00:03:51.179
 real box office interact with each other 

00:03:51.179 --> 00:03:53.119
 must be able to 

00:03:53.119 --> 00:03:55.779
 intellinet with a real-time environment 

00:03:55.779 --> 00:03:57.230
 and face a team from 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:01.570
 art. buy aspects. interviews facebook italy 

00:04:02.559 --> 00:04:04.559
 in this particular case 

00:04:04.559 --> 00:04:06.680
 which also includes interaction 

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:07.879
 people 

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:12.310
 the case of video games that we need to be artificial time 

00:04:12.309 --> 00:04:14.299
 dictation of Turkey 

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:16.469
 behavior 

00:04:16.469 --> 00:04:19.629
 interact with their little people. ok baby 

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:22.460
 a favorite actor that exact time 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:26.460
 perfect computing, ie the possibility of having machines capable of 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:28.270
 interpetare 

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:31.060
 posted festival this reason the people around
