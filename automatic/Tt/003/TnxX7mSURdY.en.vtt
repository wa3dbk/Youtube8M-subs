this time of year we're just having to
look<00:00:51.379> here<00:00:51.620> at<00:00:51.710> the<00:00:51.800> tree<00:00:52.039> a<00:00:52.070> little<00:00:52.219> bit<00:00:52.489> and

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:52.730 
look here at the tree a little bit and

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:54.549 
look here at the tree a little bit and
we<00:00:53.510> can<00:00:53.629> see<00:00:53.840> that<00:00:53.989> it's<00:00:54.170> still<00:00:54.379> pretty

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:54.559 
we can see that it's still pretty

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:55.869 
we can see that it's still pretty
dormant<00:00:54.890> I'm<00:00:55.219> just<00:00:55.399> going<00:00:55.520> to<00:00:55.579> cut<00:00:55.730> this

00:00:55.869 --> 00:00:55.879 
dormant I'm just going to cut this

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:58.180 
dormant I'm just going to cut this
little<00:00:56.090> stub<00:00:56.420> off<00:00:56.629> here<00:00:56.930> because<00:00:57.260> it's<00:00:57.469> just

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.190 
little stub off here because it's just

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.139 
little stub off here because it's just
kind<00:00:58.399> of<00:00:58.579> a<00:00:59.230> was<00:01:00.230> left<00:01:00.530> rugged<00:01:01.100> ragged<00:01:01.910> here

00:01:02.139 --> 00:01:02.149 
kind of a was left rugged ragged here

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:03.790 
kind of a was left rugged ragged here
you<00:01:02.239> can<00:01:02.390> sort<00:01:02.629> of<00:01:02.719> see<00:01:02.899> here<00:01:03.170> that<00:01:03.350> was<00:01:03.530> cut

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:03.800 
you can sort of see here that was cut

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.429 
you can sort of see here that was cut
off<00:01:03.980> it<00:01:04.520> was<00:01:04.640> a<00:01:04.670> bad<00:01:04.940> cut<00:01:05.330> so<00:01:05.630> it<00:01:05.750> needs<00:01:06.260> to<00:01:06.350> be

00:01:06.429 --> 00:01:06.439 
off it was a bad cut so it needs to be

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:09.039 
off it was a bad cut so it needs to be
removed<00:01:06.710> properly<00:01:07.310> so<00:01:07.850> by<00:01:08.390> just<00:01:08.630> cutting<00:01:08.810> it

00:01:09.039 --> 00:01:09.049 
removed properly so by just cutting it

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:11.620 
removed properly so by just cutting it
off<00:01:09.200> I've<00:01:09.439> got<00:01:09.470> rid<00:01:09.830> of<00:01:09.860> that<00:01:10.040> bad<00:01:10.820> potentially

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
off I've got rid of that bad potentially

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.250 
off I've got rid of that bad potentially
you<00:01:12.200> know<00:01:12.229> an<00:01:12.380> area<00:01:12.560> a<00:01:12.920> bad<00:01:13.400> angled<00:01:14.000> cut<00:01:14.270> where

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:15.260 
you know an area a bad angled cut where

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:16.960 
you know an area a bad angled cut where
disease<00:01:15.590> could<00:01:15.830> potentially<00:01:16.369> enter<00:01:16.640> into<00:01:16.760> the

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:16.970 
disease could potentially enter into the

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:17.380 
disease could potentially enter into the
tree

tree

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.510

I<00:01:17.420> remember<00:01:18.020> that<00:01:18.170> square<00:01:18.590> cuts<00:01:18.920> are<00:01:19.100> easier

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:19.520 
I remember that square cuts are easier

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:21.640 
I remember that square cuts are easier
for<00:01:19.729> trees<00:01:19.939> to<00:01:19.970> heal<00:01:20.420> you<00:01:21.170> don't<00:01:21.320> want<00:01:21.470> to<00:01:21.530> have

these angled cuts angled cuts are just a

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.050 
these angled cuts angled cuts are just a

you<00:01:26.689> can<00:01:26.750> actually<00:01:27.020> see<00:01:27.409> it<00:01:27.560> here<00:01:27.830> where<00:01:28.009> this

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:28.189 
you can actually see it here where this

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:30.520 
you can actually see it here where this
has<00:01:28.430> tried<00:01:28.670> to<00:01:28.820> heal<00:01:29.030> itself<00:01:29.390> it's<00:01:30.110> growing<00:01:30.380> a

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
has tried to heal itself it's growing a

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.499 
has tried to heal itself it's growing a
callus<00:01:30.979> around<00:01:31.310> here<00:01:31.520> but<00:01:31.670> it's<00:01:31.790> not<00:01:31.909> it's<00:01:32.390> not

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:34.670 
doing it it's not working so when you

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.370 
doing it it's not working so when you
make<00:01:34.790> a<00:01:34.850> nice<00:01:35.090> fresh<00:01:35.420> cut<00:01:35.630> this<00:01:35.869> way<00:01:36.110> it's
