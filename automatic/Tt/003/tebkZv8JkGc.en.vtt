wrong with it I pulled up some
information<00:00:05.819> online<00:00:06.359> I<00:00:06.629> just<00:00:06.930> plugged<00:00:07.230> in<00:00:07.410> the

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
pop up is called fixa I think this was

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:20.689 
pop up is called fixa I think this was
originally<00:00:19.920> where<00:00:20.070> I<00:00:20.100> had<00:00:20.250> seen<00:00:20.550> the

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
originally where I had seen the

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.970 
originally where I had seen the
information<00:00:21.300> on<00:00:21.480> this<00:00:21.750> piece<00:00:22.740> of<00:00:22.890> equipment

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
information on this piece of equipment

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.560 
information on this piece of equipment
before<00:00:23.760> and<00:00:25.519> the<00:00:26.519> question<00:00:27.000> was<00:00:27.180> I<00:00:27.240> have<00:00:27.539> a

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
before and the question was I have a

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:30.730 
before and the question was I have a
rippling<00:00:28.050> vibration<00:00:28.769> in<00:00:29.039> the<00:00:29.179> subwoofer

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:30.740 
rippling vibration in the subwoofer

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:33.880 
rippling vibration in the subwoofer
seemed<00:00:31.740> to<00:00:31.920> be<00:00:32.040> transformer<00:00:32.730> related<00:00:33.210> well<00:00:33.480> as

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:33.890 
seemed to be transformer related well as

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:36.170 
seemed to be transformer related well as
you<00:00:34.890> can<00:00:35.070> see<00:00:35.250> on<00:00:35.370> this<00:00:35.520> board<00:00:35.760> there's<00:00:36.030> no

volts DC back into the back into the
system<00:00:46.739> here<00:00:47.390> now<00:00:48.390> I<00:00:48.420> did<00:00:48.629> test<00:00:48.989> there<00:00:49.440> is

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
system here now I did test there is

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.810 
system here now I did test there is
about<00:00:50.719> 0.25<00:00:51.719> volts<00:00:52.230> coming<00:00:52.410> out<00:00:52.710> going<00:00:53.699> to

about 0.25 volts coming out going to

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:55.490 
about 0.25 volts coming out going to
that<00:00:54.059> subwoofer<00:00:54.570> when<00:00:54.719> it<00:00:54.870> starts<00:00:55.079> bouncing

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
that subwoofer when it starts bouncing

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.900 
that subwoofer when it starts bouncing
all<00:00:55.620> around<00:00:55.649> but<00:00:56.070> there<00:00:56.219> are<00:00:56.280> no<00:00:56.460> voltage

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
all around but there are no voltage

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.049 
all around but there are no voltage
coming<00:00:57.360> back<00:00:57.570> to<00:00:57.870> any<00:00:58.530> of<00:00:58.949> the<00:00:59.100> inputs<00:00:59.550> which<00:00:59.879> I

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059 
coming back to any of the inputs which I

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:01.369 
coming back to any of the inputs which I
don't<00:01:00.449> really<00:01:00.570> understand<00:01:00.930> why<00:01:01.050> has<00:01:01.199> two

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
don't really understand why has two

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.609 
don't really understand why has two
inputs<00:01:01.829> and<00:01:02.039> whatever<00:01:03.030> so<00:01:04.019> I<00:01:04.049> got<00:01:04.320> to<00:01:04.439> read

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
inputs and whatever so I got to read

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:07.640 
inputs and whatever so I got to read
some<00:01:04.650> information<00:01:05.010> and<00:01:06.439> the<00:01:07.439> first

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
some information and the first

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.399 
some information and the first
suggestion<00:01:08.040> was<00:01:08.400> to<00:01:08.549> replace<00:01:08.820> this<00:01:09.180> 2200<00:01:10.110> UF

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:10.409 
suggestion was to replace this 2200 UF

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.340 
suggestion was to replace this 2200 UF
cap<00:01:10.890> which<00:01:11.400> we<00:01:11.610> did<00:01:11.820> and<00:01:12.000> obviously<00:01:12.150> I<00:01:12.450> that

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
cap which we did and obviously I that

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.810 
cap which we did and obviously I that
made<00:01:13.530> a<00:01:13.560> little<00:01:13.799> difference<00:01:14.010> be<00:01:14.400> honest<00:01:14.640> with

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
made a little difference be honest with

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.359 
made a little difference be honest with
you<00:01:14.939> because<00:01:15.090> before<00:01:15.869> the<00:01:16.409> home<00:01:16.650> was<00:01:16.920> a<00:01:16.950> wool

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
you because before the home was a wool

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.149 
you because before the home was a wool
it's<00:01:18.180> like<00:01:18.330> that<00:01:18.570> I<00:01:18.600> mean<00:01:18.780> just<00:01:18.810> like<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.320> AC

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:20.159 
it's like that I mean just like the AC

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.100 
it's like that I mean just like the AC
version<00:01:20.729> that<00:01:20.820> you<00:01:20.939> hear<00:01:21.180> in<00:01:21.299> an<00:01:21.390> old<00:01:21.570> to<00:01:21.810> Brady

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
version that you hear in an old to Brady

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.200 
version that you hear in an old to Brady
I<00:01:22.200> mean<00:01:22.470> it's<00:01:22.619> just<00:01:22.650> constant<00:01:23.159> hum<00:01:23.759> no<00:01:24.000> matter

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
I mean it's just constant hum no matter

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.760 
I mean it's just constant hum no matter
what<00:01:24.509> you<00:01:24.630> couldn't<00:01:24.900> hear<00:01:24.990> nothing<00:01:25.200> over<00:01:25.680> it

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
what you couldn't hear nothing over it

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.580 
what you couldn't hear nothing over it
and<00:01:26.369> I<00:01:26.490> didn't<00:01:26.700> even<00:01:26.850> have<00:01:27.060> these<00:01:27.840> to<00:01:28.110> control

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
and I didn't even have these to control

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.350 
and I didn't even have these to control

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:30.360 
speakers plugged into it that was just

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.719

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:14.430

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.860 
and it'll have the back speakers plugged
in<00:02:18.330> so<00:02:18.540> it<00:02:18.600> must<00:02:18.810> be<00:02:18.900> back<00:02:19.290> in<00:02:20.060> front<00:02:21.060> and<00:02:21.480> sub

how<00:04:37.660> crazy<00:04:38.020> is<00:04:38.260> that<00:04:40.740> it's<00:04:41.740> obviously<00:04:41.950> got<00:04:42.490> an

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:42.610 
how crazy is that it's obviously got an

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:47.790 
how crazy is that it's obviously got an
intermittent<00:04:43.270> problem<00:04:43.300> somewhere<00:04:46.650> that<00:04:47.650> is

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:47.800 
intermittent problem somewhere that is

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:51.060 
intermittent problem somewhere that is
not<00:04:47.830> good<00:04:48.930> but<00:04:49.930> I'm<00:04:50.110> amazed<00:04:50.500> that<00:04:50.650> the<00:04:50.830> team

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:51.070 
not good but I'm amazed that the team

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:53.100 
not good but I'm amazed that the team
will<00:04:51.220> even<00:04:51.490> play<00:04:51.730> all<00:04:51.940> together<00:04:52.090> and<00:04:52.960> no

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:53.110 
will even play all together and no

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:54.570 
will even play all together and no
longer<00:04:53.380> than<00:04:53.530> that<00:04:53.620> was<00:04:53.830> on<00:04:53.950> that<00:04:53.980> plate<00:04:54.430> is

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:54.580 
longer than that was on that plate is

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:58.410 
longer than that was on that plate is
just<00:04:55.740> hot<00:04:56.740> as<00:04:56.980> can<00:04:57.160> be<00:04:57.340> you<00:04:57.670> can<00:04:57.820> hold<00:04:58.000> on<00:04:58.120> to<00:04:58.330> it

00:04:58.410 --> 00:04:58.420 
just hot as can be you can hold on to it

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:00.300 
just hot as can be you can hold on to it
a<00:04:58.480> little<00:04:58.660> bit<00:04:58.840> and<00:04:59.650> see<00:04:59.800> there's<00:04:59.980> very<00:05:00.010> little

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:00.310 
a little bit and see there's very little

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:03.180 
a little bit and see there's very little
heat<00:05:00.550> right<00:05:00.760> there<00:05:01.030> a<00:05:01.680> lot<00:05:02.680> of<00:05:03.010> heat<00:05:03.160> right

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:03.190 
heat right there a lot of heat right

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:07.380 
heat right there a lot of heat right
there<00:05:05.220> quite<00:05:06.220> a<00:05:06.250> bit<00:05:06.520> of<00:05:06.640> heat<00:05:06.790> over<00:05:06.820> that<00:05:07.180> one

00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:07.390 
there quite a bit of heat over that one

00:05:07.390 --> 00:05:10.110 
there quite a bit of heat over that one
in<00:05:07.510> this<00:05:07.630> little<00:05:07.960> resistor<00:05:08.500> is<00:05:08.620> just<00:05:09.120> scalding

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:10.120 
in this little resistor is just scalding

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:13.350 
in this little resistor is just scalding
hot<00:05:10.620> so<00:05:11.620> that's<00:05:11.920> a<00:05:12.160> very<00:05:12.520> interesting<00:05:12.790> that<00:05:13.240> it

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:13.360 
hot so that's a very interesting that it

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:18.090 
hot so that's a very interesting that it
will<00:05:13.510> still<00:05:13.780> play<00:05:15.270> so<00:05:16.270> you<00:05:16.870> know<00:05:16.990> where<00:05:17.980> does

will still play so you know where does

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:21.090 
will still play so you know where does
