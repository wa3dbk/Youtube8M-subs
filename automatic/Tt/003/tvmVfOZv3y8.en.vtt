 so to download the game there you 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.659
 takes at least two hours two hours of 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.460
 downloading 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.950

 so that's it's a game in English to 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.780
 nex holidays was not really waiting for you

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.420

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.990
 rick this demo zoric a little 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:29.280
 prehistoric prehistory of which 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.020
 you do choose you want 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.880

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.960
 there you press install it's going to last 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.880
 at least 30 minutes see sam lasted 20 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.000
 minutes 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.740
 no it's going that I dreamed of five minutes 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.200
 but you have to have a good 

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:48.710
 collection so to go to the site 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:54.640
 I want to clarify that this game is when 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:56.179
 even a pretty good graphics so is 

00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.009
 quite heavy 

00:01:56.179 --> 00:02:06.470
 I think he finished all that without 

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:08.349
 look at it that does not want me it's not 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:11.000
 serious I show you a little bit fast and 

00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:12.319
 that's how you're going to disgust me 

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.690
 so are you once you have 

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:16.580
 installed you'll have that once 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.560
 the 30 minutes will not it's that you 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:21.380
 will have installed I would have you this little 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:25.420
 lobo icon 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:27.980
 then I booked you two servers 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:31.269
 so here are two servers that I have 

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:35.599
 could find on the site on the flights 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:37.310
 survival servers so here's what 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:38.480
 she had only two for now I 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.930
 think she has no other but I 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:44.510
 found that two so here it is 

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:46.730
 a game them massively online that's it 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:49.519
