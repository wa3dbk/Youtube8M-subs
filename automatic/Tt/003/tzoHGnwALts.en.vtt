okay<00:00:01.949> here's<00:00:02.250> the<00:00:02.310> tempest<00:00:02.820> multi-game<00:00:03.620> my

00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:04.620 
okay here's the tempest multi-game my

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.440 
okay here's the tempest multi-game my
machine<00:00:05.069> obviously<00:00:05.759> still<00:00:06.029> needs<00:00:06.240> a<00:00:06.299> bit<00:00:06.420> of

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:06.450 
machine obviously still needs a bit of

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.589 
machine obviously still needs a bit of
adjustment<00:00:06.600> on<00:00:07.109> the<00:00:07.170> screen<00:00:07.470> there<00:00:07.710> and<00:00:07.950> um

00:00:08.589 --> 00:00:08.599 
adjustment on the screen there and um

00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:13.129 
adjustment on the screen there and um
the<00:00:09.599> alignment<00:00:10.110> on<00:00:10.230> the<00:00:10.769> board<00:00:11.840> also<00:00:12.840> need<00:00:13.019> to

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
the alignment on the board also need to

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:14.990 
the alignment on the board also need to
be<00:00:13.259> better<00:00:13.469> tweaking<00:00:13.920> but<00:00:14.130> a<00:00:14.190> small<00:00:14.700> that's

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
be better tweaking but a small that's

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:33.290 
be better tweaking but a small that's
working<00:00:15.920> and<00:00:16.920> this<00:00:17.220> is<00:00:17.340> just<00:00:17.520> tempest<00:00:32.180> also<00:00:33.180> on

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
working and this is just tempest also on

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.350 
working and this is just tempest also on
the<00:00:33.420> machine<00:00:33.780> Tempest<00:00:34.530> again<00:00:35.160> it's<00:00:35.910> a

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
the machine Tempest again it's a

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:48.770 
the machine Tempest again it's a
provision<00:00:44.840> 2.1<00:00:45.840> on<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:46.079> thing<00:00:46.410> is<00:00:46.680> uh<00:00:47.780> tempest

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
provision 2.1 on the thing is uh tempest

00:00:48.780 --> 00:01:12.590 
provision 2.1 on the thing is uh tempest
again

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:12.600 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.649 

the<00:01:12.990> interesting<00:01:13.320> stuff<00:01:13.770> next<00:01:14.310> one<00:01:14.550> up<00:01:14.700> is

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:17.659 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:23.750 

vortex<00:01:18.659> I<00:01:20.150> think<00:01:21.560> now<00:01:22.560> as<00:01:23.070> far<00:01:23.310> as<00:01:23.400> I<00:01:23.490> can<00:01:23.550> work

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:23.760 
vortex I think now as far as I can work

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.609 
vortex I think now as far as I can work
overtakes<00:01:24.479> not<00:01:24.900> that<00:01:25.050> definitely<00:01:25.470> from

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
overtakes not that definitely from

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:32.440 
overtakes not that definitely from
tempest<00:01:26.070> and<00:01:28.729> say<00:01:29.729> I<00:01:29.760> definitely<00:01:30.180> tracked<00:01:30.660> mud

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450 
tempest and say I definitely tracked mud

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:42.430 
tempest and say I definitely tracked mud
so<00:01:33.450> I'll<00:01:33.660> let<00:01:33.840> it<00:01:34.080> run<00:01:34.350> into<00:01:34.650> that

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:42.440 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:50.320 

there<00:01:43.070> we<00:01:43.190> go<00:01:47.920> so<00:01:48.920> that's<00:01:49.040> the<00:01:49.310> vortex<00:01:49.850> track

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:50.330 
there we go so that's the vortex track

00:01:50.330 --> 00:03:07.050 
there we go so that's the vortex track
mode<00:01:54.160> the<00:01:55.160> other<00:01:55.370> than<00:01:55.580> that

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.809 

and<00:03:08.060> so<00:03:08.270> it<00:03:08.330> was<00:03:08.690> um<00:03:09.250> slight<00:03:10.250> glitch<00:03:10.520> there

00:03:10.809 --> 00:03:10.819 
and so it was um slight glitch there

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:13.780 
and so it was um slight glitch there
that's<00:03:11.150> the<00:03:11.510> graphics<00:03:12.200> wrong<00:03:12.440> in<00:03:13.430> the<00:03:13.640> better

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
that's the graphics wrong in the better

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:18.160 
that's the graphics wrong in the better
cleaning<00:03:14.740> hmm<00:03:15.770> so<00:03:16.370> next<00:03:16.520> up<00:03:16.790> is<00:03:17.000> the<00:03:17.720> alien

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:18.170 
cleaning hmm so next up is the alien

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:23.350 
cleaning hmm so next up is the alien
splutter<00:03:18.500> tape<00:03:19.900> now<00:03:20.900> that<00:03:21.140> one<00:03:22.030> it<00:03:23.030> doesn't

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:23.360 
splutter tape now that one it doesn't

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:26.850 
splutter tape now that one it doesn't
actually<00:03:23.450> have<00:03:23.690> an<00:03:23.780> attract<00:03:24.050> more<00:03:24.230> at<00:03:24.380> all<00:03:25.780> and

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:26.860 
actually have an attract more at all and

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:29.110 
actually have an attract more at all and
it's<00:03:27.860> the<00:03:27.980> only<00:03:28.100> one<00:03:28.250> with<00:03:28.370> a<00:03:28.430> game<00:03:28.670> appears<00:03:29.030> to

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:29.120 
it's the only one with a game appears to

00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:31.630 
it's the only one with a game appears to
be<00:03:29.209> different<00:03:29.390> the<00:03:29.780> different<00:03:30.140> says<00:03:30.400> we<00:03:31.400> don't

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:31.640 
be different the different says we don't

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:37.570 
be different the different says we don't
have<00:03:32.030> a<00:03:33.430> rapid-fire<00:03:35.470> we<00:03:36.470> know<00:03:36.650> all<00:03:36.980> my<00:03:37.220> hat<00:03:37.400> we

00:03:37.570 --> 00:03:37.580 
have a rapid-fire we know all my hat we

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:41.670 
have a rapid-fire we know all my hat we
have<00:03:38.830> single<00:03:39.830> fire<00:03:40.220> and<00:03:40.580> you've<00:03:40.700> got<00:03:40.940> two

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
have single fire and you've got two

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.600 
have single fire and you've got two
mouths<00:03:42.680> about<00:03:42.980> my<00:03:43.160> crazy

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:45.610 

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:51.060 

I've<00:03:46.610> happy<00:03:47.150> with<00:03:47.269> Australis<00:03:47.750> unplayable<00:03:49.150> I

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:51.070 
I've happy with Australis unplayable I

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:56.780 
I've happy with Australis unplayable I
was<00:03:52.070> gonna<00:03:52.220> get<00:03:52.489> an<00:03:52.550> insert

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:58.800 

you<00:03:57.790> wouldn't<00:03:58.030> think<00:03:58.120> someone<00:03:58.480> looking<00:03:58.690> at

00:03:58.800 --> 00:03:58.810 
you wouldn't think someone looking at

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:00.839 
you wouldn't think someone looking at
this<00:03:58.959> but<00:03:59.260> let's<00:03:59.830> see<00:04:00.010> let's<00:04:00.250> try<00:04:00.430> an<00:04:00.580> easy

00:04:00.839 --> 00:04:00.849 
this but let's see let's try an easy

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:18.680 
this but let's see let's try an easy
level<00:04:09.420> button<00:04:10.420> all<00:04:10.569> the<00:04:10.660> time<00:04:10.840> really

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:50.770 

was<00:04:19.690> a<00:04:19.720> sudden<00:04:20.079> down

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:50.780 

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:54.230 

so<00:04:52.370> obviously<00:04:53.370> I've<00:04:53.520> got<00:04:53.670> some<00:04:53.820> factors<00:04:54.210> to

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:54.240 
so obviously I've got some factors to

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:55.700 
so obviously I've got some factors to
there<00:04:54.570> but<00:04:54.720> I<00:04:54.780> think<00:04:54.870> before<00:04:55.200> I<00:04:55.230> do<00:04:55.350> that<00:04:55.440> I've

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:55.710 
there but I think before I do that I've

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:58.700 
there but I think before I do that I've
got<00:04:55.770> some<00:04:56.070> wrong<00:04:56.310> sockets<00:04:56.760> to<00:04:56.940> clean<00:04:57.710> but

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:58.710 
got some wrong sockets to clean but

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:02.900 
got some wrong sockets to clean but
that's<00:04:59.370> Debra's<00:05:00.150> vortex<00:05:00.800> and<00:05:01.800> Hylian<00:05:02.190> one<00:05:02.700> yes

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:02.910 
that's Debra's vortex and Hylian one yes

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:45.850 
that's Debra's vortex and Hylian one yes
next<00:05:03.480> up<00:05:04.610> tempest<00:05:05.610> chips<00:05:11.990> different<00:05:12.990> things

00:05:45.850 --> 00:05:45.860 

00:05:45.860 --> 00:06:26.890 

chips<00:05:47.740> press<00:05:48.740> another<00:05:49.430> version<00:05:49.790> of<00:05:50.030> chips

00:06:26.890 --> 00:06:26.900 

00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:29.600 

and<00:06:27.900> then<00:06:28.110> there's<00:06:28.290> a<00:06:28.350> car<00:06:28.560> -<00:06:28.770> the<00:06:29.010> tubular

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:29.610 
and then there's a car - the tubular

00:06:29.610 --> 00:07:03.950 
and then there's a car - the tubular
think<00:07:01.370> and<00:07:02.370> that's<00:07:02.550> it<00:07:02.760> last<00:07:03.090> one<00:07:03.420> this<00:07:03.720> back

00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:03.960 
think and that's it last one this back

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:08.690 
think and that's it last one this back
to<00:07:04.290> back<00:07:05.840> to<00:07:06.840> tempest<00:07:07.500> national<00:07:08.010> one<00:07:08.100> again

00:07:08.690 --> 00:07:08.700 
to back to tempest national one again

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:11.750 
to back to tempest national one again
and<00:07:09.410> then<00:07:10.410> what<00:07:10.650> effects<00:07:11.040> that<00:07:11.190> graphics

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:11.760 
and then what effects that graphics

00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:15.230 
and then what effects that graphics
collectors<00:07:12.270> really<00:07:12.780> annoying<00:07:13.080> me
