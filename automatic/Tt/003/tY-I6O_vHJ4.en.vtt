00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:04.350 
showed them the very first clip that
we'd<00:01:03.010> worked<00:01:03.190> on<00:01:03.340> which<00:01:03.460> was<00:01:03.610> Optimus<00:01:04.059> Prime

feds forming in that city and it was

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:07.830 
feds forming in that city and it was
based<00:01:06.400> on<00:01:06.490> that<00:01:06.610> toy<00:01:06.820> that<00:01:07.060> I<00:01:07.210> had<00:01:07.479> seen<00:01:07.780> in

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:07.840 
based on that toy that I had seen in

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.630 
based on that toy that I had seen in
Japan<00:01:08.290> which<00:01:08.560> is<00:01:08.590> this<00:01:08.830> white<00:01:09.100> version<00:01:09.549> of

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:09.640 
Japan which is this white version of

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.340 
Japan which is this white version of
that<00:01:10.180> robot<00:01:10.540> and<00:01:10.690> they<00:01:10.750> look<00:01:10.870> beautiful

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:11.350 
that robot and they look beautiful

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.320 
that robot and they look beautiful
you<00:01:11.560> know<00:01:11.680> our<00:01:11.799> biggest<00:01:11.979> challenge<00:01:12.460> in

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:13.330 
you know our biggest challenge in

00:01:13.330 --> 00:01:15.060 
you know our biggest challenge in
rendering<00:01:14.020> real-time<00:01:14.350> graphics<00:01:14.830> that<00:01:14.920> our

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:15.070 
rendering real-time graphics that our

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:16.590 
rendering real-time graphics that our
cinema<00:01:15.340> quality<00:01:15.700> is<00:01:15.820> that<00:01:16.030> the<00:01:16.180> size<00:01:16.390> of<00:01:16.479> the

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:16.600 
cinema quality is that the size of the

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.200 
cinema quality is that the size of the
data<00:01:16.780> sets<00:01:17.049> and<00:01:17.310> I<00:01:18.310> think<00:01:18.790> one<00:01:18.880> of<00:01:18.909> the<00:01:19.030> things

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:19.210 
data sets and I think one of the things

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:21.210 
data sets and I think one of the things
that's<00:01:19.570> helped<00:01:19.840> narrow<00:01:20.560> that<00:01:20.710> gap<00:01:20.770> for<00:01:21.010> us<00:01:21.070> the

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:21.220 
that's helped narrow that gap for us the

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:22.859 
that's helped narrow that gap for us the
most<00:01:21.340> of<00:01:21.520> it<00:01:21.610> definitely<00:01:21.909> has<00:01:22.060> been<00:01:22.210> the<00:01:22.330> gddr5

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:22.869 
most of it definitely has been the gddr5

of interest from game publishers and I
count<00:01:39.280> my<00:01:39.400> stage<00:01:39.729> is<00:01:39.909> probably<00:01:40.240> you<00:01:40.720> know<00:01:40.810> the

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:40.930 
count my stage is probably you know the

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:42.899 
count my stage is probably you know the
the<00:01:41.619> biggest<00:01:41.799> hole<00:01:42.040> we<00:01:42.100> have<00:01:42.130> in<00:01:42.369> that<00:01:42.460> Arsenal

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:42.909 
the biggest hole we have in that Arsenal

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:44.730 
the biggest hole we have in that Arsenal
so<00:01:43.119> to<00:01:43.180> speak<00:01:43.420> videos<00:01:43.960> of<00:01:44.170> these<00:01:44.259> characters

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:44.740 
so to speak videos of these characters

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:46.560 
so to speak videos of these characters
on<00:01:44.890> my<00:01:45.009> stage<00:01:45.280> they<00:01:45.490> just<00:01:45.700> look<00:01:45.880> perfect<00:01:46.479> I

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:46.570 
on my stage they just look perfect I

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:48.570 
on my stage they just look perfect I
mean<00:01:46.689> I<00:01:46.810> can't<00:01:47.110> tell<00:01:47.320> whether<00:01:48.159> it's<00:01:48.250> a<00:01:48.400> real

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:48.580

person or a CG character and that's

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:52.830 
person or a CG character and that's
that's<00:01:51.670> what<00:01:51.880> I<00:01:51.909> didn't<00:01:52.180> hand<00:01:52.299> out<00:01:52.390> of<00:01:52.450> out<00:01:52.810> of
