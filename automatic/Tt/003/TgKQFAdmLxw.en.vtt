00:04:35.379 --> 00:04:35.389 
but when challenges come up it doesn't

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:37.360

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:40.570 
does not mean that you are not capable
and<00:04:39.229> it<00:04:39.320> doesn't<00:04:39.620> mean<00:04:39.740> that<00:04:39.770> you<00:04:40.039> can't<00:04:40.370> be

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:40.580
