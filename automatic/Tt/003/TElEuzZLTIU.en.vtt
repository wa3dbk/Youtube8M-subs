tutorial and today I'm going to talk
about<00:00:08.250> printing<00:00:08.820> I<00:00:09.230> just<00:00:10.230> want<00:00:10.380> to<00:00:10.440> show<00:00:10.590> you<00:00:10.650> a

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:10.740 
about printing I just want to show you a

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:12.320 
about printing I just want to show you a
couple<00:00:11.130> of<00:00:11.190> hopefully<00:00:11.550> pretty<00:00:11.849> quick<00:00:12.090> things

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
couple of hopefully pretty quick things

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.049 
couple of hopefully pretty quick things
today<00:00:12.740> the<00:00:13.740> first<00:00:13.980> one<00:00:14.160> is<00:00:14.309> is<00:00:14.580> what<00:00:14.759> I've<00:00:14.880> done

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:15.059 
today the first one is is what I've done

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:16.670 
today the first one is is what I've done
here<00:00:15.299> is<00:00:15.450> I've<00:00:15.660> just<00:00:15.690> gone<00:00:16.139> and<00:00:16.289> I've<00:00:16.440> created

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
here is I've just gone and I've created

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.320 
here is I've just gone and I've created
a<00:00:16.920> spreadsheet<00:00:17.220> with<00:00:17.580> several<00:00:17.880> rows<00:00:18.119> and

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
a spreadsheet with several rows and

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:21.830 
a spreadsheet with several rows and
columns<00:00:19.010> and<00:00:20.010> just<00:00:20.279> put<00:00:20.490> a<00:00:20.520> random<00:00:21.300> numbers<00:00:21.630> in

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:21.840 
columns and just put a random numbers in

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:26.120 
columns and just put a random numbers in
the<00:00:22.380> in<00:00:22.830> the<00:00:23.189> worksheet<00:00:23.869> so<00:00:24.869> the<00:00:25.650> first<00:00:25.920> way<00:00:26.099> to

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
the in the worksheet so the first way to

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.759 
the in the worksheet so the first way to
print<00:00:26.519> is<00:00:26.699> to<00:00:27.240> do<00:00:27.660> what<00:00:27.960> what's<00:00:28.439> called<00:00:28.680> a

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
print is to do what what's called a

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:30.169 
print is to do what what's called a
quick<00:00:28.980> print<00:00:29.279> if<00:00:29.369> you<00:00:29.429> go<00:00:29.609> here<00:00:29.789> to<00:00:29.820> the<00:00:29.970> quick

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:30.179 
quick print if you go here to the quick

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:32.600 
quick print if you go here to the quick
access<00:00:30.420> toolbar<00:00:30.929> up<00:00:31.380> top<00:00:31.650> here<00:00:31.920> there's<00:00:32.460> a

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
access toolbar up top here there's a

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.410 
access toolbar up top here there's a
little<00:00:32.759> pull<00:00:33.059> down<00:00:33.090> option<00:00:33.809> here<00:00:35.000> select<00:00:36.000> that

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
little pull down option here select that

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.440 
little pull down option here select that
and<00:00:36.690> then<00:00:37.110> click<00:00:37.410> the<00:00:38.309> quick<00:00:38.610> print<00:00:38.969> option

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.450 
and then click the quick print option

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:41.690 
and then click the quick print option
and<00:00:39.600> what<00:00:40.050> that'll<00:00:40.260> do<00:00:40.500> is<00:00:40.530> add<00:00:40.860> a<00:00:40.890> quick<00:00:41.370> print

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:41.700 
and what that'll do is add a quick print

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.479 
and what that'll do is add a quick print
icon<00:00:41.879> here<00:00:42.480> and<00:00:42.809> if<00:00:43.620> I<00:00:43.770> were<00:00:43.980> to<00:00:44.040> click<00:00:44.280> this

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
icon here and if I were to click this

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:46.190 
icon here and if I were to click this
right<00:00:44.730> now<00:00:44.910> it<00:00:45.149> would<00:00:45.300> just<00:00:45.510> print<00:00:45.719> the<00:00:45.840> active

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
right now it would just print the active

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.880 
right now it would just print the active
worksheet<00:00:46.440> in<00:00:46.950> the<00:00:47.219> default<00:00:47.579> mode<00:00:47.750> portrait

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
orientation probably not going to use

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:54.080 
orientation probably not going to use
that<00:00:52.860> a<00:00:52.890> whole<00:00:53.070> lot<00:00:53.250> unless<00:00:53.550> you're<00:00:53.730> working

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:54.090 
that a whole lot unless you're working

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:56.990 
that a whole lot unless you're working
with<00:00:54.270> a<00:00:54.300> really<00:00:54.390> basic<00:00:54.899> spreadsheet<00:00:56.000> so

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
with a really basic spreadsheet so

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.330 
with a really basic spreadsheet so
there's<00:00:57.899> several<00:00:58.199> options<00:00:58.800> here<00:00:58.859> when<00:00:59.160> you<00:00:59.219> go

00:00:59.330 --> 00:00:59.340 
there's several options here when you go

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:03.290 
there's several options here when you go
under<00:00:59.550> view<00:01:00.559> there's<00:01:01.559> several<00:01:02.460> layouts<00:01:02.760> here

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
under view there's several layouts here

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.240 
under view there's several layouts here
one<00:01:03.690> is<00:01:03.809> a<00:01:03.840> normal<00:01:04.290> layout<00:01:04.470> which<00:01:04.830> doesn't

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
one is a normal layout which doesn't

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.399 
one is a normal layout which doesn't
typically<00:01:05.610> show<00:01:05.880> you<00:01:05.939> page<00:01:06.299> breaks<00:01:06.720> and<00:01:07.170> and

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
typically show you page breaks and and

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.260 
typically show you page breaks and and
so<00:01:07.710> forth<00:01:08.010> just<00:01:08.100> shows<00:01:08.490> you<00:01:08.640> your<00:01:08.850> your

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:09.270 
so forth just shows you your your

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:15.020 
so forth just shows you your your
worksheet<00:01:10.790> then<00:01:11.790> there's<00:01:12.090> a<00:01:13.490> page<00:01:14.490> layout

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
worksheet then there's a page layout

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.990 
worksheet then there's a page layout
view<00:01:15.290> the<00:01:16.290> page<00:01:16.530> layout<00:01:16.950> view<00:01:16.979> will<00:01:17.640> break<00:01:17.850> it

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
view the page layout view will break it

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.950 
view the page layout view will break it
down<00:01:18.180> by<00:01:18.450> page<00:01:20.150> okay<00:01:21.150> so<00:01:21.180> you<00:01:21.420> can<00:01:21.570> see<00:01:21.600> how

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
down by page okay so you can see how

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.960 
down by page okay so you can see how
it's<00:01:22.170> actually<00:01:22.500> going<00:01:22.680> to<00:01:22.799> print<00:01:23.189> you<00:01:23.850> can

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
header let's see here another thing that

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.350 
header let's see here another thing that
you<00:01:30.960> can<00:01:31.110> do<00:01:31.259> is<00:01:31.439> click<00:01:31.650> page<00:01:32.070> break<00:01:32.970> preview

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:35.360 

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.710 

and<00:01:36.920> that'll<00:01:37.920> break<00:01:38.130> it<00:01:38.280> down<00:01:38.490> and<00:01:38.880> show<00:01:38.939> you

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
exactly where all the page breaks are

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.730 
exactly where all the page breaks are
and<00:01:42.180> it's<00:01:42.420> an<00:01:42.540> easy<00:01:42.750> way<00:01:43.049> of<00:01:43.079> editing<00:01:43.590> your

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
and it's an easy way of editing your

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.910 
and it's an easy way of editing your
page<00:01:43.920> breaks<00:01:44.250> this<00:01:45.180> blue<00:01:45.649> hyphenated<00:01:46.649> line

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
page breaks this blue hyphenated line

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.030 
page breaks this blue hyphenated line
here<00:01:47.399> is<00:01:47.670> our<00:01:47.939> page<00:01:48.180> break<00:01:48.479> in<00:01:48.659> this<00:01:48.750> case<00:01:49.040> you

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
here is our page break in this case you

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.880 
here is our page break in this case you
can<00:01:50.220> see<00:01:50.399> we<00:01:50.549> have<00:01:50.729> one<00:01:51.000> here<00:01:51.380> so<00:01:52.380> let's<00:01:52.560> assume

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
can see we have one here so let's assume

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:55.429 
can see we have one here so let's assume
this<00:01:53.130> isn't<00:01:53.520> the<00:01:53.640> right<00:01:53.850> setting<00:01:54.780> and<00:01:54.990> we<00:01:55.200> want

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
this isn't the right setting and we want

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.100 
this isn't the right setting and we want
to<00:01:55.500> move<00:01:55.680> this<00:01:55.890> page<00:01:56.189> break<00:01:56.520> over<00:01:57.180> to<00:01:57.479> behind

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
to move this page break over to behind

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:01.310 
to move this page break over to behind
column<00:01:58.560> F<00:01:58.770> here<00:01:59.100> all<00:02:00.090> we<00:02:00.329> have<00:02:00.450> to<00:02:00.540> do<00:02:00.689> is<00:02:00.899> move

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:01.320 
column F here all we have to do is move

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:03.080 
column F here all we have to do is move
the<00:02:01.500> mouse<00:02:01.680> anywhere<00:02:02.189> along<00:02:02.430> here<00:02:02.490> where<00:02:02.939> you

the mouse anywhere along here where you

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:07.990

so now what we've done is we've moved
that<00:02:16.700> page<00:02:16.970> break<00:02:17.620> likewise<00:02:18.620> if<00:02:18.830> we<00:02:18.890> want<00:02:19.130> to

that page break likewise if we want to

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:20.950 
that page break likewise if we want to
move<00:02:19.310> this<00:02:19.520> up<00:02:19.700> a<00:02:19.820> couple<00:02:19.850> runs<00:02:20.360> the<00:02:20.660> same

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:20.960 
move this up a couple runs the same

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:22.900 
move this up a couple runs the same
thing<00:02:21.290> we<00:02:21.500> take<00:02:21.740> the<00:02:21.860> mouse<00:02:22.070> till<00:02:22.400> we<00:02:22.490> get<00:02:22.670> to

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:22.910 
thing we take the mouse till we get to

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:26.260 
thing we take the mouse till we get to
split<00:02:23.180> arrows<00:02:23.630> and<00:02:24.250> we<00:02:25.250> click<00:02:25.580> the<00:02:25.730> mouse<00:02:25.880> and

split arrows and we click the mouse and

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:29.860 
split arrows and we click the mouse and
we<00:02:26.300> just<00:02:26.959> drag<00:02:27.350> it<00:02:27.560> and<00:02:28.160> drop<00:02:28.600> it<00:02:29.600> where<00:02:29.750> we

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
we just drag it and drop it where we

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.560 
we just drag it and drop it where we
want<00:02:29.900> to<00:02:30.320> so<00:02:31.160> now<00:02:31.340> we<00:02:31.400> can<00:02:31.730> customize<00:02:32.270> the

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
layout like that one other thing to note

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.470 
layout like that one other thing to note
is<00:02:36.890> that<00:02:37.459> this<00:02:37.790> is<00:02:37.850> just<00:02:38.150> the<00:02:38.330> default

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:38.480 
is that this is just the default

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.520 
is that this is just the default
settings<00:02:40.209> another<00:02:41.209> thing<00:02:41.390> you<00:02:41.480> can<00:02:41.570> do<00:02:41.780> if<00:02:42.290> you

settings another thing you can do if you

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.550 
settings another thing you can do if you
would<00:02:42.680> like<00:02:42.800> to<00:02:42.950> remove<00:02:43.130> a<00:02:43.430> page<00:02:43.640> break<00:02:44.470> see<00:02:45.470> if

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
would like to remove a page break see if

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.229 
would like to remove a page break see if
we<00:02:45.650> could<00:02:45.800> remove<00:02:46.100> one<00:02:46.160> here<00:02:46.580> let<00:02:46.910> me<00:02:47.030> add<00:02:47.209> a

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:47.239 
we could remove one here let me add a

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:49.030 
we could remove one here let me add a
page<00:02:47.600> break<00:02:47.630> let<00:02:47.959> me<00:02:48.050> add<00:02:48.200> a<00:02:48.230> page<00:02:48.530> break<00:02:48.560> here

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:49.040 
page break let me add a page break here

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.220 
page break let me add a page break here
so<00:02:49.880> let's<00:02:50.000> assume<00:02:50.270> we<00:02:50.420> wanted<00:02:50.690> to<00:02:50.780> add<00:02:50.900> a<00:02:50.930> page

00:02:51.220 --> 00:02:51.230 
so let's assume we wanted to add a page

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:56.770 
so let's assume we wanted to add a page
break<00:02:51.560> here<00:02:51.670> we<00:02:52.670> can<00:02:52.820> go<00:02:52.970> into<00:02:55.300> let's<00:02:56.300> see<00:02:56.510> page

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
break here we can go into let's see page

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.900 
break here we can go into let's see page
layout<00:02:57.170> and<00:02:57.440> then<00:02:57.980> we<00:02:58.070> go<00:02:58.190> to<00:02:58.220> break<00:02:58.489> so<00:02:58.730> we<00:02:58.820> can

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
layout and then we go to break so we can

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:00.910 
layout and then we go to break so we can
say<00:02:59.030> insert<00:02:59.480> page<00:02:59.780> break<00:02:59.810> and<00:03:00.350> it<00:03:00.530> will<00:03:00.650> put

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
say insert page break and it will put

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.890 
say insert page break and it will put
insert<00:03:01.640> that<00:03:01.880> page<00:03:02.150> break<00:03:02.420> in<00:03:02.600> there<00:03:02.750> but

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900 
insert that page break in there but

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.500 
insert that page break in there but
let's<00:03:03.020> just<00:03:03.230> assume<00:03:03.560> for<00:03:03.620> a<00:03:03.890> moment<00:03:04.040> that<00:03:04.510> we

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:05.510 
let's just assume for a moment that we

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:07.150 
let's just assume for a moment that we
don't<00:03:05.690> want<00:03:05.870> that<00:03:06.050> page<00:03:06.320> break<00:03:06.650> to<00:03:06.830> go<00:03:06.980> in

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:07.160 
don't want that page break to go in

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.729 
don't want that page break to go in
there<00:03:07.340> we<00:03:07.520> go<00:03:07.670> back<00:03:07.880> to<00:03:08.060> breaks<00:03:08.360> and<00:03:09.140> we<00:03:09.380> remove

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:09.739 
there we go back to breaks and we remove

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:12.430 
there we go back to breaks and we remove
the<00:03:09.890> page<00:03:10.100> break<00:03:11.230> okay

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:12.440 
the page break okay

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:14.229 
the page break okay
another<00:03:12.980> common<00:03:13.430> thing<00:03:13.549> that<00:03:13.610> you'd<00:03:13.880> like<00:03:14.030> to

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:14.239 
another common thing that you'd like to

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:18.100 
another common thing that you'd like to

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:19.580

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:13.740 
there we go I can drag this margin over

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:16.070 
there we go I can drag this margin over
up<00:04:13.980> top<00:04:14.370> here<00:04:14.640> and<00:04:14.700> you<00:04:14.880> see<00:04:15.510> it<00:04:15.630> tells<00:04:15.870> me

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:16.080 
up top here and you see it tells me

00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:17.720 
up top here and you see it tells me
there's<00:04:16.470> a<00:04:16.560> little<00:04:16.799> pop-up<00:04:17.160> that<00:04:17.190> tells<00:04:17.549> me

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:17.730 
there's a little pop-up that tells me

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:20.660 
there's a little pop-up that tells me
where<00:04:17.880> it's<00:04:18.030> at<00:04:18.180> I<00:04:18.560> can<00:04:19.560> just<00:04:19.739> drag<00:04:20.010> it<00:04:20.190> over<00:04:20.280> to

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:20.670 
where it's at I can just drag it over to

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:23.660 
where it's at I can just drag it over to
say<00:04:20.880> point<00:04:21.269> five<00:04:21.900> inches<00:04:22.380> so<00:04:23.130> I<00:04:23.160> can<00:04:23.430> just

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:23.670 
say point five inches so I can just

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:27.010 
say point five inches so I can just
manually<00:04:24.180> and<00:04:24.720> visually<00:04:25.440> make<00:04:25.800> those<00:04:26.070> changes

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.020 
manually and visually make those changes

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:29.390 
manually and visually make those changes
so<00:04:28.020> that's<00:04:28.530> another<00:04:28.770> option<00:04:29.040> of<00:04:29.250> how<00:04:29.340> to

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:29.400 
so that's another option of how to

00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:31.730 
so that's another option of how to
change<00:04:29.730> margins<00:04:30.240> another<00:04:31.110> thing<00:04:31.410> that<00:04:31.590> you

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:31.740 
change margins another thing that you

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:35.030 
change margins another thing that you
commonly<00:04:32.640> have<00:04:32.820> to<00:04:32.970> do<00:04:33.150> in<00:04:33.450> Excel<00:04:33.930> is<00:04:34.230> change

00:04:35.030 --> 00:04:35.040 
commonly have to do in Excel is change

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:38.000 
commonly have to do in Excel is change
the<00:04:35.310> page<00:04:35.550> oriental<00:04:36.240> in<00:04:36.480> Torreon<00:04:36.870> tation<00:04:37.260> so

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.010 
the page oriental in Torreon tation so

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:39.770 
the page oriental in Torreon tation so
the<00:04:38.550> easiest<00:04:38.880> way<00:04:39.000> to<00:04:39.060> do<00:04:39.270> that<00:04:39.390> is<00:04:39.510> going<00:04:39.690> to

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
the easiest way to do that is going to

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.380 
the easiest way to do that is going to
page<00:04:39.990> layout<00:04:40.610> orientation<00:04:41.610> and<00:04:41.790> you<00:04:42.240> can

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:42.390 
page layout orientation and you can

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:43.970 
page layout orientation and you can
choose<00:04:42.600> portrait<00:04:43.080> or<00:04:43.170> landscape<00:04:43.410> I'm<00:04:43.830> going

00:04:43.970 --> 00:04:43.980 
choose portrait or landscape I'm going

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:46.370 
choose portrait or landscape I'm going
to<00:04:44.040> change<00:04:44.280> this<00:04:44.430> to<00:04:44.490> landscape<00:04:45.170> I'm<00:04:46.170> going<00:04:46.320> to

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:46.380 
to change this to landscape I'm going to

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:49.430 
to change this to landscape I'm going to
go<00:04:46.470> back<00:04:46.680> into<00:04:47.010> my<00:04:48.000> view<00:04:48.360> and<00:04:48.810> clean<00:04:49.080> up<00:04:49.230> some

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:49.440 
go back into my view and clean up some

00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:52.910 
go back into my view and clean up some
of<00:04:49.560> these<00:04:49.650> page<00:04:49.950> breaks<00:04:51.410> okay<00:04:52.410> I'm<00:04:52.680> going<00:04:52.860> to

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:52.920 
of these page breaks okay I'm going to

00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:57.970 
of these page breaks okay I'm going to
go<00:04:53.070> ahead<00:04:53.160> and<00:04:53.490> and<00:04:53.730> move<00:04:54.390> this<00:04:54.630> over<00:04:54.810> here<00:04:56.540> and

go ahead and and move this over here and

00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:00.850 
go ahead and and move this over here and
now<00:04:58.980> I'm<00:04:59.130> going<00:04:59.280> to<00:04:59.340> go<00:04:59.490> back<00:04:59.670> to<00:04:59.850> page<00:05:00.030> layout

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:00.860 
now I'm going to go back to page layout

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:03.620 
now I'm going to go back to page layout
orientation<00:05:01.860> it's<00:05:02.010> on<00:05:02.160> landscape<00:05:02.730> and<00:05:03.510> then

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:03.630 
orientation it's on landscape and then

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:07.060 
orientation it's on landscape and then
what<00:05:03.720> we<00:05:03.810> can<00:05:03.990> do<00:05:04.170> can<00:05:04.500> go<00:05:04.650> into<00:05:05.010> print<00:05:05.970> and

00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:07.070 
what we can do can go into print and

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:09.980 
what we can do can go into print and
let's<00:05:08.070> do<00:05:08.250> a<00:05:08.280> print<00:05:08.580> preview<00:05:08.790> you<00:05:09.450> can<00:05:09.570> see<00:05:09.660> it

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:09.990 
let's do a print preview you can see it

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:11.630 
let's do a print preview you can see it
put<00:05:10.169> it<00:05:10.290> landscape<00:05:10.830> when<00:05:11.040> we<00:05:11.130> have<00:05:11.220> several

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:11.640 
put it landscape when we have several

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:14.570 
put it landscape when we have several
rows<00:05:12.080> but<00:05:13.080> one<00:05:13.230> of<00:05:13.350> the<00:05:13.410> things<00:05:13.650> that<00:05:13.950> you<00:05:14.400> may

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:14.580 
rows but one of the things that you may

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:18.050 
rows but one of the things that you may
want<00:05:14.610> to<00:05:14.910> do<00:05:15.169> is<00:05:16.280> you<00:05:17.280> may<00:05:17.430> want<00:05:17.669> to<00:05:17.700> go<00:05:17.850> on<00:05:17.970> to

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:18.060 
want to do is you may want to go on to

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:22.040 
want to do is you may want to go on to
page<00:05:18.240> setup<00:05:18.570> here<00:05:18.990> and<00:05:20.540> you<00:05:21.540> might<00:05:21.780> want<00:05:21.990> to

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:22.050 
page setup here and you might want to

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:26.810 
page setup here and you might want to
squeeze<00:05:22.470> everything<00:05:23.220> onto<00:05:24.030> one<00:05:24.720> page<00:05:25.820> one

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:26.820 
squeeze everything onto one page one

00:05:26.820 --> 00:05:30.170 
squeeze everything onto one page one
page<00:05:27.000> wide<00:05:27.300> by<00:05:27.690> one<00:05:27.930> page<00:05:28.140> tall<00:05:28.640> so<00:05:29.640> compress

00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:30.180 
page wide by one page tall so compress

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:33.860 
page wide by one page tall so compress
the<00:05:30.360> document<00:05:30.930> you<00:05:31.230> say<00:05:31.440> okay<00:05:31.860> and<00:05:32.870> you'll

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:33.870 
the document you say okay and you'll

00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:35.600 
the document you say okay and you'll
notice<00:05:34.110> it<00:05:34.410> compressed<00:05:34.830> it<00:05:34.980> down<00:05:35.160> very<00:05:35.430> very

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:35.610 
notice it compressed it down very very

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:38.210 
notice it compressed it down very very
small<00:05:36.150> here<00:05:36.390> Excel<00:05:37.230> doesn't<00:05:37.410> care<00:05:37.650> how<00:05:37.800> tiny

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:38.220 
small here Excel doesn't care how tiny

00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:40.700 
small here Excel doesn't care how tiny
you<00:05:38.460> make<00:05:38.669> your<00:05:38.970> your<00:05:39.510> font<00:05:39.810> it<00:05:40.110> doesn't<00:05:40.560> take

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:40.710 
you make your your font it doesn't take

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:42.830 
you make your your font it doesn't take
that<00:05:40.860> into<00:05:41.070> consideration<00:05:41.660> so<00:05:42.660> that's

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:42.840 
that into consideration so that's

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:44.030 
that into consideration so that's
probably<00:05:43.110> not<00:05:43.320> going<00:05:43.470> to<00:05:43.530> be<00:05:43.620> a<00:05:43.680> good<00:05:43.830> choice

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:44.040 
probably not going to be a good choice

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:45.620 
probably not going to be a good choice
so<00:05:44.370> what<00:05:44.550> we<00:05:44.669> want<00:05:44.850> to<00:05:44.940> do<00:05:45.090> you<00:05:45.270> see<00:05:45.480> what

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:45.630 
so what we want to do you see what

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:48.170 
so what we want to do you see what
happened<00:05:46.020> it<00:05:46.230> squeezed<00:05:46.950> it<00:05:47.190> compressed<00:05:47.790> it<00:05:48.000> to

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:48.180 
happened it squeezed it compressed it to

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:51.380 
happened it squeezed it compressed it to
40%<00:05:48.840> of<00:05:48.900> normal<00:05:49.260> size<00:05:49.550> so<00:05:50.550> probably<00:05:51.150> what<00:05:51.300> we

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:51.390 
40% of normal size so probably what we

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:54.260 
40% of normal size so probably what we
want<00:05:51.570> to<00:05:51.630> do<00:05:51.780> is<00:05:52.020> go<00:05:52.230> to<00:05:52.310> one<00:05:53.310> pages<00:05:53.760> wide<00:05:53.970> by

00:05:54.260 --> 00:05:54.270 
want to do is go to one pages wide by

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:57.200 
want to do is go to one pages wide by
two<00:05:54.330> pages<00:05:54.720> tall<00:05:55.140> and<00:05:55.890> click<00:05:56.160> OK<00:05:56.520> and<00:05:56.820> that's

00:05:57.200 --> 00:05:57.210 
two pages tall and click OK and that's

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:59.300 
two pages tall and click OK and that's
much<00:05:57.480> more<00:05:57.510> readable<00:05:57.960> okay<00:05:58.830> then<00:05:59.010> if<00:05:59.130> you<00:05:59.220> go

00:05:59.300 --> 00:05:59.310 
much more readable okay then if you go

00:05:59.310 --> 00:06:00.680 
much more readable okay then if you go
back<00:05:59.490> into<00:05:59.669> page<00:05:59.910> setup<00:06:00.270> you<00:06:00.390> see<00:06:00.570> it

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:00.690 
back into page setup you see it

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:03.020 
back into page setup you see it
compressed<00:06:01.080> it<00:06:01.230> down<00:06:01.380> to<00:06:01.500> 82<00:06:01.770> percent<00:06:02.030> which

00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:03.030 
compressed it down to 82 percent which

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:05.750 
compressed it down to 82 percent which
is<00:06:03.060> probably<00:06:03.660> legible<00:06:04.230> as<00:06:05.220> far<00:06:05.550> as<00:06:05.640> your

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:05.760 
is probably legible as far as your

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:07.550 
is probably legible as far as your
printout<00:06:06.060> goes<00:06:06.240> the<00:06:07.050> other<00:06:07.200> thing<00:06:07.410> while

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:07.560 
printout goes the other thing while

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:11.090 
printout goes the other thing while
you're<00:06:07.740> in<00:06:07.830> here<00:06:08.130> if<00:06:08.610> you<00:06:09.740> would<00:06:10.740> like<00:06:10.919> to
