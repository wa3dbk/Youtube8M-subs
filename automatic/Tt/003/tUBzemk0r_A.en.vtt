I were to make a like a top 10 which I

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:22.860 
I were to make a like a top 10 which I

coming<00:03:24.250> your<00:03:24.370> way<00:03:24.430> pretty<00:03:24.790> soon<00:03:24.820> but<00:03:25.480> if<00:03:25.600> I

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:25.690 
coming your way pretty soon but if I

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:28.350 
coming your way pretty soon but if I
were<00:03:25.750> to<00:03:25.780> make<00:03:25.900> a<00:03:25.959> top<00:03:26.290> 10<00:03:26.590> worst<00:03:27.330> attachments

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:28.360 
were to make a top 10 worst attachments

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.210 
were to make a top 10 worst attachments
I<00:03:28.420> think<00:03:28.780> the<00:03:28.930> ACOG<00:03:29.290> we<00:03:29.500> one<00:03:29.709> of<00:03:29.860> if<00:03:30.010> not<00:03:30.040> the

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
I think the ACOG we one of if not the

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.220 
I think the ACOG we one of if not the
worst<00:03:30.640> attachment<00:03:31.269> to<00:03:31.360> me<00:03:31.480> in<00:03:31.630> qaulity

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
worst attachment to me in qaulity

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.170 
worst attachment to me in qaulity
because<00:03:32.500> the<00:03:33.160> only<00:03:33.340> time<00:03:33.519> it's<00:03:33.730> ever<00:03:33.820> really<00:03:33.940> a

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
because the only time it's ever really a

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.420 
because the only time it's ever really a
viable<00:03:34.480> option<00:03:34.840> is<00:03:35.290> like<00:03:35.500> the<00:03:35.650> sniper<00:03:35.920> rifles

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:36.430 
viable option is like the sniper rifles

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:38.100 
viable option is like the sniper rifles
even<00:03:36.850> then<00:03:37.000> it's<00:03:37.180> not<00:03:37.269> that<00:03:37.390> good<00:03:37.810> than<00:03:37.989> the

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:38.110 
even then it's not that good than the

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:40.860 
even then it's not that good than the
sniper<00:03:38.350> rifles<00:03:38.890> so<00:03:39.519> I<00:03:39.970> just<00:03:40.480> don't<00:03:40.630> understand

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 
sniper rifles so I just don't understand

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:42.870 
sniper rifles so I just don't understand
how<00:03:40.930> people<00:03:40.959> use<00:03:41.380> ACOG<00:03:41.769> I<00:03:41.980> don't<00:03:42.340> understand

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:42.880 
how people use ACOG I don't understand

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:44.759 
how people use ACOG I don't understand
it<00:03:43.000> but<00:03:43.090> there's<00:03:43.269> a<00:03:43.360> lot<00:03:43.540> of<00:03:43.630> you<00:03:43.750> that<00:03:43.930> do<00:03:44.080> let

00:03:44.759 --> 00:03:44.769 
it but there's a lot of you that do let

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:54.310 
anyone could possibly like the ACOG it

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:56.820 
anyone could possibly like the ACOG it
just<00:03:54.580> it<00:03:55.390> seems<00:03:55.570> weird<00:03:55.870> it<00:03:56.110> just<00:03:56.530> seems<00:03:56.739> weird

about the Kem strike a little bit

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:05.430 
about the Kem strike a little bit
towards<00:04:04.690> the<00:04:04.810> game<00:04:04.959> but<00:04:05.110> for<00:04:05.170> the<00:04:05.260> most<00:04:05.350> part

00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:05.440 
towards the game but for the most part

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.140 
towards the game but for the most part
we're<00:04:05.650> kinda<00:04:05.950> it's<00:04:06.040> like<00:04:06.160> straying<00:04:06.760> away<00:04:06.880> from

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150 
we're kinda it's like straying away from

we're kinda it's like straying away from
the<00:04:07.209> gameplay<00:04:07.390> but<00:04:08.110> the<00:04:08.230> gameplay<00:04:08.410> itself<00:04:08.799> man

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:09.010

you<00:05:12.729> can<00:05:12.849> try<00:05:13.000> and<00:05:13.060> get<00:05:13.150> clips<00:05:13.389> but<00:05:13.810> then<00:05:14.050> you

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:14.110 
you can try and get clips but then you

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:14.939 
you can try and get clips but then you
actually<00:05:14.169> gets<00:05:14.440> Kem<00:05:14.560> strike<00:05:14.650> right<00:05:14.860> there

00:05:14.939 --> 00:05:14.949
