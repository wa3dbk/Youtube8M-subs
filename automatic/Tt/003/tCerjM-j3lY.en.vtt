in the white this is just showing you
how<00:00:52.690> much<00:00:52.870> power<00:00:53.109> you're<00:00:53.230> using<00:00:53.260> from<00:00:53.680> the

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969 
how much power you're using from the

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:56.520 
how much power you're using from the
electric<00:00:54.969> motor<00:00:55.180> so<00:00:56.019> now<00:00:56.140> as<00:00:56.260> you<00:00:56.320> can<00:00:56.410> see

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:56.530 
electric motor so now as you can see

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:58.049 
electric motor so now as you can see
when<00:00:56.800> we're<00:00:56.949> driving<00:00:57.190> the<00:00:57.519> vehicle<00:00:57.969> is

00:00:58.049 --> 00:00:58.059 
when we're driving the vehicle is

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:00.010 
running off the gas engine when it's

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:01.229 
running off the gas engine when it's
running<00:01:00.190> off<00:01:00.340> the<00:01:00.489> gas<00:01:00.640> engine<00:01:00.879> that's

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:01.239 
running off the gas engine that's

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:03.060 
running off the gas engine that's
sending<00:01:01.480> power<00:01:01.780> back<00:01:02.019> to<00:01:02.230> the<00:01:02.260> electric<00:01:02.590> motor

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:03.070 
sending power back to the electric motor

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:05.310 
sending power back to the electric motor
you<00:01:04.000> can<00:01:04.180> see<00:01:04.360> that<00:01:04.540> right<00:01:04.720> here<00:01:04.900> in<00:01:04.989> the<00:01:05.080> gauge

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:05.320
