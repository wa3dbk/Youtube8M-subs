00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:08.069
 hello to all today i'm going 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.230
 realize so this little video for 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.179
 you actually explain how to achieve 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:17.039
 a stencil to make a tattoo 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:18.779
 on the skin so that's the paper so 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.270
 so it's carbon paper 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:23.400
 paper for transfer so this paper has 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:27.029
 the peculiarity of being able to be used 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:27.349
 either with a machine or only with 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:29.820
 m 

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:33.090
 that's what we have today so the 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:35.880
 realization only by hand 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:40.620
 so the model that I would like 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:43.739
 realize you then have your 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.920
 carbon sheet that features four 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.920
 leaves 

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:52.800
 the most important being the third 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:54.780
 so that's the carbon sheet then 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.239
 watch out the carbon fairy is one side 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:01.190
 glossy and a matt side this is the side 

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:06.930
 mac that interests us we can withdraw 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:11.700
 the first two paid our lack 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:13.700
 multi made they are used simply 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:18.060
 for those who use a machine 

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:23.490
 Then I took your model 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:25.040
 put the so white side against the 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:29.070
 carbon 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:31.590
 you can place paper clips for 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.890
 avoid moving avoid utter 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:38.400
 movement on the on the carbon this is in 

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:43.430
 done after all you simply have the 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:45.860
 drawing and after using a pen pen 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:49.350
 is only bic 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:53.760
 you will go back to the contours of 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:55.950
 your drawing what makes that carbon 

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:58.140
 will soak up behind the passage of 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:04.590
 your pen and then you will not have 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:08.759
 than to apply the back of your 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:10.350
 leaf directly on the skin here 

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.989
 I hope this video will be able to 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:17.310
 help and you can find my page 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:19.620

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:22.130
 tattoo see you soon for 

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.130
