00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.410 
you out of town on a rail I'm suggesting

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:26.640 
you out of town on a rail I'm suggesting
why<00:02:24.190> go<00:02:24.430> I<00:02:24.700> mean<00:02:25.060> money<00:02:25.750> obviously<00:02:26.290> being<00:02:26.470> the

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
why go I mean money obviously being the

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:28.350 
why go I mean money obviously being the
one<00:02:26.860> factor<00:02:27.430> I<00:02:27.460> don't<00:02:27.790> know<00:02:27.850> if<00:02:27.940> they<00:02:28.030> can<00:02:28.210> go

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:28.360 
one factor I don't know if they can go

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:29.850 
one factor I don't know if they can go
from<00:02:28.540> so<00:02:28.780> much<00:02:28.930> more<00:02:29.080> money<00:02:29.170> than<00:02:29.410> Memphis<00:02:29.680> can

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
from so much more money than Memphis can

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.550 
from so much more money than Memphis can
but<00:02:30.280> aside<00:02:30.550> from<00:02:30.610> that<00:02:30.790> why<00:02:31.270> go<00:02:31.510> because<00:02:32.290> he

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
but aside from that why go because he

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.250 
but aside from that why go because he
can<00:02:32.710> be<00:02:32.860> mainstreamed<00:02:33.550> and<00:02:33.760> for<00:02:34.000> two<00:02:34.180> months

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
can be mainstreamed and for two months

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.050 
can be mainstreamed and for two months
from<00:02:35.260> basically<00:02:35.650> the<00:02:35.860> end<00:02:35.980> of<00:02:36.100> December<00:02:36.610> until

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
from basically the end of December until

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.660 
from basically the end of December until
March<00:02:37.360> he's<00:02:38.080> on<00:02:38.230> the<00:02:38.380> side<00:02:38.590> you<00:02:39.550> know

March he's on the side you know

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.640 
March he's on the side you know
Conference<00:02:40.090> USA<00:02:40.210> you<00:02:41.170> know<00:02:41.200> I<00:02:41.290> don't<00:02:41.470> want<00:02:41.590> to

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
Conference USA you know I don't want to

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.500 
Conference USA you know I don't want to
disparage<00:02:42.220> the<00:02:42.580> other<00:02:42.700> networks<00:02:43.090> but<00:02:43.360> they're

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:43.510 
disparage the other networks but they're

00:02:43.510 --> 00:02:46.770 
disparage the other networks but they're
not<00:02:43.630> a<00:02:43.870> main<00:02:44.140> player<00:02:44.590> on<00:02:44.950> our<00:02:44.980> network<00:02:45.610> or<00:02:45.820> CBS

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:48.990 
not a main player on our network or CBS
