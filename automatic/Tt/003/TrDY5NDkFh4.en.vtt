actually slowly grows outward it almost

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.200 
actually slowly grows outward it almost
forms<00:01:07.590> a<00:01:07.680> little<00:01:07.860> conveyor<00:01:08.430> belt<00:01:08.790> that

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
forms a little conveyor belt that

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
part of the ear and don't worry about a

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.340 
part of the ear and don't worry about a
thing<00:01:20.340> the<00:01:21.210> biggest<00:01:21.570> mistake<00:01:21.990> you<00:01:22.170> can<00:01:22.320> make

is to introduce a q-tip or cotton swab

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.560 
is to introduce a q-tip or cotton swab
into<00:01:25.979> the<00:01:26.159> ear<00:01:26.369> canal<00:01:26.400> there's<00:01:27.240> a<00:01:27.330> little

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
into the ear canal there's a little

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.810 
into the ear canal there's a little
narrowing<00:01:28.200> or<00:01:28.380> turn<00:01:28.979> here<00:01:29.400> that<00:01:29.579> the<00:01:29.670> ear

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
narrowing or turn here that the ear

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.969 
narrowing or turn here that the ear
canal<00:01:29.970> makes<00:01:30.329> about<00:01:30.570> halfway<00:01:30.840> down<00:01:31.229> and<00:01:31.619> what

canal makes about halfway down and what

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.490 
canal makes about halfway down and what
you're<00:01:32.159> likely<00:01:32.369> to<00:01:32.640> do<00:01:32.759> is<00:01:32.909> to<00:01:33.030> impact<00:01:33.630> wax<00:01:34.110> in

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
you're likely to do is to impact wax in

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.710 
you're likely to do is to impact wax in
that<00:01:35.159> narrowing<00:01:35.670> and<00:01:35.909> actually<00:01:36.450> cause<00:01:36.689> a

that narrowing and actually cause a

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.050 
that narrowing and actually cause a
blockage<00:01:37.079> it's<00:01:37.530> also<00:01:37.680> very<00:01:38.009> easy<00:01:38.430> to<00:01:38.820> damage
