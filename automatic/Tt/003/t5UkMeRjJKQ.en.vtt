about<00:01:54.340> it's<00:01:54.580> linked<00:01:55.000> next<00:01:55.659> to<00:01:55.840> a<00:01:55.870> son<00:01:56.350> biomes

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:56.800 
about it's linked next to a son biomes

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.290 
about it's linked next to a son biomes
look<00:01:57.100> for<00:01:57.280> the<00:01:57.340> sand<00:01:57.580> and<00:01:57.850> you<00:01:57.940> will<00:01:58.060> see<00:01:58.210> the

00:01:58.290 --> 00:01:58.300 
look for the sand and you will see the

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:59.340 
look for the sand and you will see the
mess<00:01:58.450> of<00:01:58.600> iron<00:01:58.750> but<00:01:58.900> give<00:01:59.020> a<00:01:59.050> little<00:01:59.080> bit<00:01:59.260> of

00:01:59.340 --> 00:01:59.350 
mess of iron but give a little bit of

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:01.260 
mess of iron but give a little bit of
time<00:01:59.470> to<00:02:00.040> spawn<00:02:00.400> but<00:02:00.580> basically<00:02:00.940> straight

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:01.270 
time to spawn but basically straight

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.360

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:08.530 
part seems to be kind of broken so some

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.830 
part seems to be kind of broken so some
of<00:02:08.560> it<00:02:08.709> is<00:02:08.860> kind<00:02:09.369> of<00:02:09.459> broken<00:02:09.670> bow<00:02:10.060> the<00:02:10.390> majority

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:10.840

today on my iphone 6 which arrived

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:40.960 
today on my iphone 6 which arrived
yesterday<00:03:39.110> so<00:03:40.070> I'm<00:03:40.190> a<00:03:40.280> little<00:03:40.370> bit<00:03:40.549> loose<00:03:40.730> and

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:40.970 
yesterday so I'm a little bit loose and

yesterday so I'm a little bit loose and
a<00:03:41.000> little<00:03:41.180> bit<00:03:41.299> slow<00:03:42.140> I<00:03:42.320> using<00:03:42.680> the<00:03:42.709> buttons

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:43.370 
a little bit slow I using the buttons

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.100 
a little bit slow I using the buttons
again<00:03:43.549> but<00:03:44.239> you<00:03:44.330> can<00:03:44.450> see<00:03:44.660> it<00:03:44.750> just<00:03:44.959> looks

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:45.110 
again but you can see it just looks

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:46.810 
again but you can see it just looks
absolutely<00:03:45.500> magnificent<00:03:46.280> it<00:03:46.430> makes<00:03:46.640> this

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:46.820 
absolutely magnificent it makes this

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:48.610 
absolutely magnificent it makes this
terrain<00:03:47.180> and<00:03:47.480> this<00:03:47.570> mess<00:03:47.750> up<00:03:47.870> I<00:03:47.959> am<00:03:48.110> even<00:03:48.590> more

00:03:48.610 --> 00:03:48.620 
terrain and this mess up I am even more

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:51.130 
terrain and this mess up I am even more
fun<00:03:49.130> to<00:03:49.310> explore<00:03:49.640> like<00:03:50.330> I<00:03:50.450> said<00:03:50.510> console

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:51.140 
fun to explore like I said console

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:52.840 
fun to explore like I said console
edition<00:03:51.470> on<00:03:51.590> pc<00:03:51.620> both<00:03:52.220> don't<00:03:52.489> have<00:03:52.670> this

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:52.850 
edition on pc both don't have this

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:54.880 
edition on pc both don't have this
feature<00:03:53.060> I<00:03:53.480> think<00:03:53.989> console<00:03:54.350> edition<00:03:54.650> might

00:03:54.880 --> 00:03:54.890 
feature I think console edition might

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:56.530 
feature I think console edition might
get<00:03:55.100> messy<00:03:55.220> biomes<00:03:55.640> in<00:03:55.730> the<00:03:55.820> next<00:03:56.030> big<00:03:56.180> update

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 
get messy biomes in the next big update

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:57.910 
get messy biomes in the next big update
but<00:03:56.750> I<00:03:56.780> don't<00:03:56.959> think<00:03:57.110> we'll<00:03:57.290> get<00:03:57.410> the<00:03:57.560> surface

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:57.920 
but I don't think we'll get the surface

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.410 
but I don't think we'll get the surface
mine<00:03:58.130> shafts<00:03:58.430> I<00:03:58.640> think<00:03:59.120> that<00:03:59.239> would<00:03:59.330> be

00:03:59.410 --> 00:03:59.420 
mine shafts I think that would be

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:00.789 
mine shafts I think that would be
amazing<00:03:59.660> if<00:03:59.989> they<00:04:00.140> could<00:04:00.380> do<00:04:00.590> that<00:04:00.739> for

00:04:00.789 --> 00:04:00.799 
amazing if they could do that for

00:04:00.799 --> 00:04:03.190 
amazing if they could do that for
console<00:04:01.340> edition<00:04:01.730> I'd<00:04:02.480> be<00:04:02.720> absolutely

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:03.200 
console edition I'd be absolutely

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.979 
console edition I'd be absolutely
forever<00:04:03.610> amazingly<00:04:04.610> happy<00:04:05.060> and<00:04:05.540> you<00:04:05.870> can

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:05.989 
forever amazingly happy and you can

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:07.570 
forever amazingly happy and you can
seems<00:04:06.170> like<00:04:06.290> that<00:04:06.410> random<00:04:06.830> like<00:04:07.010> dead<00:04:07.310> patch

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:07.580 
seems like that random like dead patch

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:09.190 
seems like that random like dead patch
that<00:04:07.820> you<00:04:07.940> get<00:04:08.180> when<00:04:08.390> you<00:04:08.510> when<00:04:08.810> you<00:04:08.840> go<00:04:09.049> inside

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:09.200 
that you get when you when you go inside

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.979 
that you get when you when you go inside
mine<00:04:09.590> shafts<00:04:09.890> I<00:04:10.040> just<00:04:10.250> passed<00:04:10.430> it<00:04:10.610> there<00:04:10.989> and

00:04:11.979 --> 00:04:11.989 
mine shafts I just passed it there and

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:12.970 
mine shafts I just passed it there and
was<00:04:12.140> going<00:04:12.320> to<00:04:12.380> check<00:04:12.470> out<00:04:12.590> the<00:04:12.739> other<00:04:12.860> side

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:12.980 
was going to check out the other side

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:14.289 
was going to check out the other side
that's<00:04:13.220> messed<00:04:13.459> up<00:04:13.549> I<00:04:13.670> own<00:04:13.820> because<00:04:14.030> like<00:04:14.150> I

00:04:14.289 --> 00:04:14.299 
that's messed up I own because like I

00:04:14.299 --> 00:04:17.440 
that's messed up I own because like I
said<00:04:14.360> it<00:04:14.630> is<00:04:14.660> linked<00:04:15.290> inside<00:04:16.190> a<00:04:16.609> sand<00:04:17.060> by<00:04:17.269> them

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:17.450 
said it is linked inside a sand by them

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:18.610 
said it is linked inside a sand by them
but<00:04:17.600> this<00:04:17.720> is<00:04:17.840> where<00:04:17.959> you<00:04:18.049> have<00:04:18.169> to<00:04:18.290> be<00:04:18.410> careful

00:04:18.610 --> 00:04:18.620 
but this is where you have to be careful

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:21.250 
but this is where you have to be careful
because<00:04:19.010> some<00:04:19.340> of<00:04:19.370> the<00:04:19.489> sand<00:04:20.140> obviously<00:04:21.140> when

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:21.260 
because some of the sand obviously when

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:23.110 
because some of the sand obviously when
it<00:04:21.350> generates<00:04:21.739> is<00:04:22.070> stuck<00:04:22.460> with<00:04:22.669> no<00:04:22.910> gravity

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:23.120 
it generates is stuck with no gravity

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:25.960 
it generates is stuck with no gravity
but<00:04:23.930> normally<00:04:24.320> a<00:04:24.350> son<00:04:24.830> has<00:04:25.100> gravity<00:04:25.610> so<00:04:25.790> if<00:04:25.880> you

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:25.970 
but normally a son has gravity so if you

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:28.000 
but normally a son has gravity so if you
place<00:04:26.180> down<00:04:26.390> torches<00:04:26.960> or<00:04:27.080> send<00:04:27.380> blocks<00:04:27.710> be

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:28.010 
place down torches or send blocks be

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:30.130 
place down torches or send blocks be
careful<00:04:28.340> you<00:04:28.430> don't<00:04:28.550> get<00:04:28.700> sand<00:04:29.090> trapped<00:04:29.870> and

00:04:30.130 --> 00:04:30.140 
careful you don't get sand trapped and

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:31.930 
careful you don't get sand trapped and
then<00:04:30.500> I'll<00:04:30.680> start<00:04:30.950> to<00:04:31.070> die<00:04:31.250> through<00:04:31.580> the<00:04:31.700> walls

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:31.940 
then I'll start to die through the walls

00:04:31.940 --> 00:04:33.490 
then I'll start to die through the walls
but<00:04:32.270> you<00:04:32.660> can<00:04:32.780> see<00:04:32.930> there<00:04:33.110> you've<00:04:33.290> got<00:04:33.410> the

but you can see there you've got the
