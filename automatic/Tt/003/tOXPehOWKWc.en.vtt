00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
with the run up on the outside calling

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.050 
with the run up on the outside calling
the<00:01:03.480> 99<00:01:03.930> Edwards<00:01:04.350> I<00:01:04.619> think<00:01:05.250> Gordon<00:01:05.460> did<00:01:05.790> work<00:01:05.939> a

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
the 99 Edwards I think Gordon did work a

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.140 
the 99 Edwards I think Gordon did work a
little<00:01:06.420> justly<00:01:07.049> yeah<00:01:07.260> but<00:01:07.770> touch<00:01:08.100> there<00:01:08.430> but

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
little justly yeah but touch there but

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.330 
little justly yeah but touch there but
then<00:01:09.330> when<00:01:09.479> he<00:01:09.510> does<00:01:09.780> Edwards<00:01:10.710> has<00:01:10.860> got<00:01:11.040> to<00:01:11.189> hit

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
then when he does Edwards has got to hit

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.130 
then when he does Edwards has got to hit
into<00:01:11.640> the<00:01:11.729> back<00:01:11.880> of<00:01:11.909> the<00:01:12.119> 14<00:01:12.510> of<00:01:12.540> Tony<00:01:12.780> Stewart

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
into the back of the 14 of Tony Stewart

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.609 
into the back of the 14 of Tony Stewart
I<00:01:13.640> think<00:01:14.640> Gordon<00:01:15.150> got<00:01:15.479> into<00:01:15.780> Stewart<00:01:16.170> enough

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
I think Gordon got into Stewart enough

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:19.370 
I think Gordon got into Stewart enough
to<00:01:16.860> move<00:01:17.220> him<00:01:17.520> it<00:01:17.729> the<00:01:18.390> contact<00:01:18.869> of<00:01:19.020> Edwards

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
to move him it the contact of Edwards

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.320 
to move him it the contact of Edwards
though<00:01:19.619> I<00:01:19.890> think<00:01:20.189> it<00:01:20.340> happened<00:01:20.640> when<00:01:20.759> Stewart

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:21.330 
though I think it happened when Stewart

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.149 
though I think it happened when Stewart
broke<00:01:21.630> a<00:01:21.659> little<00:01:22.020> momentum<00:01:22.290> Edwards<00:01:22.860> had<00:01:23.040> it

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
broke a little momentum Edwards had it

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.310 
broke a little momentum Edwards had it
in<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.580> 99<00:01:24.030> had<00:01:24.180> that<00:01:24.330> great<00:01:24.540> run<00:01:24.780> coming<00:01:25.200> off

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
in the 99 had that great run coming off
