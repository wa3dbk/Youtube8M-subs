00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:04.500 
to give you the MassDEP is right there

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:07.480 
to give you the MassDEP is right there
at<00:06:04.980> least

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:07.490 

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:09.980 

so<00:06:08.490> rather<00:06:08.700> than<00:06:08.880> replace<00:06:09.210> policy<00:06:09.750> for<00:06:09.930> the

00:06:09.980 --> 00:06:09.990 
so rather than replace policy for the

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:11.710 
so rather than replace policy for the
lab<00:06:10.140> natural

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:11.720 
lab natural

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:15.100 
lab natural
I<00:06:11.750> think<00:06:12.620> the<00:06:12.980> authored<00:06:13.340> by<00:06:14.300> Patricia<00:06:14.780> one

00:06:15.100 --> 00:06:15.110 
I think the authored by Patricia one

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:17.320 
I think the authored by Patricia one
that<00:06:15.320> she<00:06:15.740> in<00:06:15.860> the<00:06:15.980> x-ray<00:06:16.340> that<00:06:16.880> those<00:06:17.060> both

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:17.330 
that she in the x-ray that those both

00:06:17.330 --> 00:06:20.440 
that she in the x-ray that those both
for<00:06:17.570> bed<00:06:17.750> and<00:06:18.940> what<00:06:19.940> about<00:06:20.090> this<00:06:20.240> little

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:20.450 
for bed and what about this little

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:24.880 
for bed and what about this little
cracking<00:06:20.960> here<00:06:22.600> or<00:06:23.600> is<00:06:23.690> that<00:06:23.780> just<00:06:23.840> Lee<00:06:24.140> that's

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:24.890 
cracking here or is that just Lee that's

00:06:24.890 --> 00:06:28.900 
cracking here or is that just Lee that's
drying<00:06:25.280> out<00:06:25.610> mainly<00:06:26.500> okay<00:06:27.500> so<00:06:27.800> what<00:06:28.460> I<00:06:28.490> do<00:06:28.730> I'm

00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:28.910 
drying out mainly okay so what I do I'm

00:06:28.910 --> 00:06:31.510 
drying out mainly okay so what I do I'm
here<00:06:29.210> just<00:06:29.600> get<00:06:29.810> something<00:06:30.320> back<00:06:30.530> on<00:06:30.800> the<00:06:30.920> reef

00:06:31.510 --> 00:06:31.520 
here just get something back on the reef

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:35.080 
here just get something back on the reef
that<00:06:31.550> out<00:06:32.030> that<00:06:32.780> filler<00:06:33.080> and<00:06:33.700> get<00:06:34.700> something

00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:35.090 
that out that filler and get something

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:36.850 
that out that filler and get something
on<00:06:35.240> there<00:06:35.450> as<00:06:35.540> soon<00:06:35.690> as<00:06:35.810> possible<00:06:36.410> to<00:06:36.590> stop

00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:36.860 
on there as soon as possible to stop

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:41.260 
on there as soon as possible to stop
that<00:06:37.840> all<00:06:38.840> of<00:06:39.140> us<00:06:39.260> uses<00:06:39.890> Oh<00:06:40.220> hope<00:06:40.610> is<00:06:40.790> very<00:06:41.060> bad

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:41.270 
that all of us uses Oh hope is very bad

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:44.830 
that all of us uses Oh hope is very bad
about<00:06:41.450> doing<00:06:42.040> but<00:06:43.040> not<00:06:43.220> original<00:06:43.760> it<00:06:44.240> probably

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:44.840 
about doing but not original it probably

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:55.750 
about doing but not original it probably
is<00:06:49.180> funky<00:06:50.180> but<00:06:53.320> not<00:06:54.320> in<00:06:54.560> the<00:06:54.710> room<00:06:54.920> these<00:06:55.700> are

00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:55.760 
is funky but not in the room these are

00:06:55.760 --> 00:07:00.100 
is funky but not in the room these are
important<00:06:56.390> bolts<00:06:56.690> here<00:06:58.630> so<00:06:59.630> we'll<00:06:59.870> get<00:06:59.960> the

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:00.110 
important bolts here so we'll get the

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:01.900 
important bolts here so we'll get the
exhale<00:07:00.530> that<00:07:00.770> yeah<00:07:01.100> because<00:07:01.280> this<00:07:01.580> is<00:07:01.730> where

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:01.910 
exhale that yeah because this is where

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:09.610 
exhale that yeah because this is where
the<00:07:02.000> stem<00:07:02.650> joins<00:07:03.650> the<00:07:03.860> four-foot<00:07:08.530> sailing<00:07:09.530> the

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:09.620 
the stem joins the four-foot sailing the

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:10.840 
the stem joins the four-foot sailing the
weather<00:07:09.830> yeah

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:10.850 
weather yeah

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:13.440 
weather yeah
the<00:07:11.120> force<00:07:11.420> day<00:07:11.630> is<00:07:11.780> pulling<00:07:12.140> up<00:07:12.260> on<00:07:12.410> the<00:07:12.530> bow

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:13.450 
the force day is pulling up on the bow

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:16.510 
the force day is pulling up on the bow
so<00:07:14.450> it<00:07:14.480> pulls<00:07:14.810> on<00:07:14.990> that<00:07:15.200> joint<00:07:15.470> it's<00:07:16.100> really

00:07:16.510 --> 00:07:16.520 
so it pulls on that joint it's really

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:19.540 
so it pulls on that joint it's really
pulls<00:07:16.790> on<00:07:16.940> that<00:07:17.120> and<00:07:17.650> that's<00:07:18.650> why<00:07:18.800> you<00:07:18.860> get<00:07:19.100> get

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:19.550 
pulls on that and that's why you get get

00:07:19.550 --> 00:07:20.950 
pulls on that and that's why you get get
leaks<00:07:19.790> to<00:07:19.970> on<00:07:20.060> the<00:07:20.150> letter<00:07:20.360> and<00:07:20.600> then<00:07:20.690> we<00:07:20.780> seem

00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:20.960 
leaks to on the letter and then we seem

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:22.870 
leaks to on the letter and then we seem
to<00:07:20.990> talk<00:07:21.260> to<00:07:21.470> bow<00:07:21.590> to<00:07:21.620> stop<00:07:21.920> freakin<00:07:22.340> right

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:22.880 
to talk to bow to stop freakin right

00:07:22.880 --> 00:07:25.360 
to talk to bow to stop freakin right
this<00:07:23.270> is<00:07:23.510> another<00:07:23.840> joint<00:07:24.320> and<00:07:24.740> you<00:07:24.980> metal

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:25.370 
this is another joint and you metal

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:27.910 
this is another joint and you metal
plate
