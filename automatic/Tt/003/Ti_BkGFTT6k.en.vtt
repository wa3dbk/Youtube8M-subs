workout interesting but the basic
premises<00:00:13.080> of<00:00:13.259> bodybuilding<00:00:13.799> don't<00:00:14.099> change<00:00:14.400> so

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
premises of bodybuilding don't change so

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.640 
premises of bodybuilding don't change so
you'd<00:00:15.150> still<00:00:15.420> want<00:00:15.660> to<00:00:15.750> remember<00:00:15.960> your<00:00:16.289> 8<00:00:16.470> to

per body part your rest intervals would

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:24.590 
per body part your rest intervals would

all of those same premises would remain
the<00:00:27.750> way<00:00:27.990> you're<00:00:28.260> going<00:00:28.560> to<00:00:28.619> build<00:00:28.890> muscle

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160 
the way you're going to build muscle

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.980 
the way you're going to build muscle
regardless<00:00:30.000> of<00:00:30.119> your<00:00:30.210> modality<00:00:30.779> is<00:00:30.810> by

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:30.990 
regardless of your modality is by

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:32.870 
regardless of your modality is by
working<00:00:31.170> in<00:00:31.470> your<00:00:31.619> negatives<00:00:32.070> so<00:00:32.520> you<00:00:32.610> want<00:00:32.790> to

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
working in your negatives so you want to

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.610 
working in your negatives so you want to
tear<00:00:33.149> down<00:00:33.180> the<00:00:33.630> muscle<00:00:33.960> as<00:00:34.079> much<00:00:34.290> as<00:00:34.440> possible

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
tear down the muscle as much as possible

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.470 
tear down the muscle as much as possible
so<00:00:35.340> that<00:00:35.370> it<00:00:35.520> builds<00:00:35.610> scar<00:00:35.969> tissue<00:00:36.239> and

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
so that it builds scar tissue and

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:38.450 
so that it builds scar tissue and
increase<00:00:36.809> muscle<00:00:37.050> mass<00:00:37.200> as<00:00:37.559> it<00:00:38.010> rebuilds

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
increase muscle mass as it rebuilds

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.580 
increase muscle mass as it rebuilds
itself<00:00:38.550> so<00:00:39.270> you<00:00:39.329> want<00:00:39.600> to<00:00:39.719> concentrate<00:00:40.050> on<00:00:40.410> the

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
itself so you want to concentrate on the

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.250 
itself so you want to concentrate on the
negative<00:00:41.070> or<00:00:41.280> lowering<00:00:42.180> portion<00:00:42.780> of<00:00:42.899> the

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
negative or lowering portion of the

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.950 
negative or lowering portion of the
movement<00:00:43.680> every<00:00:44.239> exercise<00:00:45.239> that<00:00:45.570> you<00:00:45.629> can<00:00:45.719> do

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
movement every exercise that you can do

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.600 
movement every exercise that you can do
with<00:00:46.110> free<00:00:46.320> weights<00:00:46.500> you<00:00:46.770> can<00:00:46.800> also<00:00:47.160> do<00:00:47.460> with

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
with free weights you can also do with

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.610 
with free weights you can also do with
resistance<00:00:48.090> bands<00:00:48.450> with<00:00:48.870> resistance<00:00:49.410> bands

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:49.620 
resistance bands with resistance bands

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.920 
resistance bands with resistance bands
the<00:00:50.039> difficulty<00:00:50.700> of<00:00:50.730> the<00:00:50.969> exercise<00:00:51.420> increases

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:51.930 
the difficulty of the exercise increases

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.110 
the difficulty of the exercise increases
the<00:00:52.379> farther<00:00:52.710> away<00:00:52.800> you<00:00:53.129> are<00:00:53.520> from<00:00:53.550> your<00:00:53.910> base

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
the farther away you are from your base

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.540 
the farther away you are from your base
so<00:00:54.719> once<00:00:55.079> you<00:00:55.199> walk<00:00:55.440> away<00:00:55.649> from<00:00:55.980> where<00:00:56.430> you

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
so once you walk away from where you

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.069 
so once you walk away from where you
have<00:00:56.670> attached<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.210> resistance<00:00:57.629> band<00:00:57.870> it

00:00:58.069 --> 00:00:58.079 
have attached the resistance band it

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:00.170 
have attached the resistance band it
will<00:00:58.350> get<00:00:58.500> more<00:00:58.710> and<00:00:58.859> more<00:00:59.010> difficult<00:00:59.190> to<00:00:59.640> as

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
will get more and more difficult to as

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.049 
will get more and more difficult to as
the<00:01:00.539> tension<00:01:00.960> increases<00:01:01.379> as<00:01:01.789> with<00:01:02.789> free

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
the tension increases as with free

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.850 
the tension increases as with free
weights<00:01:03.239> you<00:01:03.840> would<00:01:03.989> want<00:01:04.199> to<00:01:04.350> work<00:01:04.500> on<00:01:04.739> your

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
weights you would want to work on your

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.740 
weights you would want to work on your
larger<00:01:05.280> muscles<00:01:05.640> first<00:01:05.880> so<00:01:06.299> let's<00:01:06.330> talk<00:01:06.630> about

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750 
larger muscles first so let's talk about

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.750 
larger muscles first so let's talk about
our<00:01:06.869> push<00:01:07.200> exercises<00:01:07.890> let's<00:01:08.369> talk<00:01:08.520> about<00:01:08.670> a

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:08.760 
our push exercises let's talk about a

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.760 
our push exercises let's talk about a
chest<00:01:09.090> press<00:01:09.270> so<00:01:09.869> for<00:01:10.049> a<00:01:10.080> chest<00:01:10.350> press<00:01:10.500> we

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
chest press so for a chest press we

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.740 
chest press so for a chest press we
would<00:01:10.950> want<00:01:11.159> to<00:01:11.250> secure<00:01:11.760> the<00:01:11.970> resistance<00:01:12.479> band

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
would want to secure the resistance band

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.859 
would want to secure the resistance band
to<00:01:13.290> somewhere<00:01:13.799> ideally<00:01:14.549> chest<00:01:14.939> high<00:01:15.240> make

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:15.869 
to somewhere ideally chest high make

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:17.510 
to somewhere ideally chest high make
sure<00:01:15.900> it's<00:01:16.229> nice<00:01:16.439> and<00:01:16.500> secure<00:01:16.830> and<00:01:17.070> that<00:01:17.430> you

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
sure it's nice and secure and that you

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.359 
sure it's nice and secure and that you
have<00:01:17.729> equaled<00:01:18.240> resistance<00:01:18.930> or<00:01:19.380> equal<00:01:19.860> tension

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
have equaled resistance or equal tension

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.700 
have equaled resistance or equal tension
left<00:01:21.000> to<00:01:21.180> right<00:01:21.390> so<00:01:21.900> you<00:01:21.990> would<00:01:22.110> want<00:01:22.350> to<00:01:22.409> walk

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:22.710 
left to right so you would want to walk

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:25.039 
left to right so you would want to walk
away<00:01:22.979> from<00:01:23.280> where<00:01:24.060> you're<00:01:24.210> secure<00:01:24.689> anchor

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
away from where you're secure anchor

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:27.200 
away from where you're secure anchor
point<00:01:25.290> is<00:01:25.530> and<00:01:25.740> remember<00:01:26.250> again<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:26.909> farther

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
point is and remember again the farther

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.090 
point is and remember again the farther
you<00:01:27.270> walk<00:01:27.540> away<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:28.080> more<00:01:28.229> resistance<00:01:28.500> you'll

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:29.100 
you walk away the more resistance you'll

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.550 
you walk away the more resistance you'll
have<00:01:29.369> you<00:01:30.030> want<00:01:30.180> to<00:01:30.240> have<00:01:30.390> your<00:01:30.509> elbows<00:01:30.990> chest

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
have you want to have your elbows chest

exercise for a smaller muscle group

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.789 
exercise for a smaller muscle group
would<00:01:41.549> be<00:01:41.700> your<00:01:41.790> delts<00:01:42.210> a<00:01:42.329> lateral<00:01:43.320> raise<00:01:43.560> is<00:01:43.770> a
