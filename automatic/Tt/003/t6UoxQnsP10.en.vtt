the<00:04:14.700> app<00:04:14.820> store<00:04:14.850> if<00:04:15.180> you're<00:04:15.450> in<00:04:15.690> the<00:04:15.870> in<00:04:16.440> cydia

00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:16.950 
the app store if you're in the in cydia

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:19.030 
the app store if you're in the in cydia
if<00:04:17.040> you<00:04:17.130> know<00:04:17.250> where<00:04:17.400> to<00:04:17.430> get<00:04:17.580> it<00:04:17.640> from<00:04:17.900> um

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:19.040 
if you know where to get it from um

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:23.090 
if you know where to get it from um
there's<00:04:20.040> other<00:04:20.280> stuff<00:04:20.760> in<00:04:21.090> here<00:04:21.720> also<00:04:22.100> where

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:23.100 
there's other stuff in here also where

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:25.550 
there's other stuff in here also where
you<00:04:23.640> can<00:04:23.760> randomize<00:04:24.390> it<00:04:24.660> where<00:04:24.810> everything<00:04:25.380> is

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
you can randomize it where everything is

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.190 
you can randomize it where everything is
random<00:04:26.040> so<00:04:26.430> it's<00:04:27.150> not<00:04:27.240> just<00:04:27.330> like<00:04:27.750> you<00:04:27.960> know

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:28.200 
random so it's not just like you know

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:29.810 
random so it's not just like you know
all<00:04:28.470> the<00:04:28.740> skulls<00:04:29.070> it's<00:04:29.280> like<00:04:29.430> it<00:04:29.550> could<00:04:29.700> be<00:04:29.730> a

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:29.820 
all the skulls it's like it could be a

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:31.640 
all the skulls it's like it could be a
skull<00:04:30.210> it<00:04:30.360> can<00:04:30.480> be<00:04:30.570> a<00:04:30.600> cloud<00:04:30.990> you<00:04:31.290> know<00:04:31.410> that's

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:31.650 
skull it can be a cloud you know that's

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:35.390 
skull it can be a cloud you know that's
pretty<00:04:31.770> cool<00:04:32.720> there's<00:04:33.720> collections<00:04:34.380> you<00:04:35.250> can

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400 
pretty cool there's collections you can

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.430 
pretty cool there's collections you can
hide<00:04:35.640> the<00:04:35.670> shadows<00:04:36.300> you<00:04:36.990> can<00:04:37.140> enable

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440 
hide the shadows you can enable

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:39.710 
hide the shadows you can enable
colorization<00:04:38.250> i'm<00:04:38.970> not<00:04:39.120> going<00:04:39.330> to<00:04:39.360> do<00:04:39.540> because

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:39.720 
colorization i'm not going to do because

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:41.900 
colorization i'm not going to do because
I<00:04:39.810> it'll<00:04:40.590> take<00:04:40.830> too<00:04:41.010> long<00:04:41.190> for<00:04:41.490> my<00:04:41.580> phone<00:04:41.880> to

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:41.910 
I it'll take too long for my phone to

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:43.670 
I it'll take too long for my phone to
load<00:04:42.240> and<00:04:42.510> you<00:04:42.810> know<00:04:42.930> it<00:04:43.350> would<00:04:43.440> just<00:04:43.530> be

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:43.680 
load and you know it would just be

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:45.410 
load and you know it would just be
easier<00:04:43.710> if<00:04:44.010> you<00:04:44.130> guys<00:04:44.280> just<00:04:44.310> mess<00:04:44.820> around<00:04:44.850> with

easier if you guys just mess around with

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:47.150 
easier if you guys just mess around with
