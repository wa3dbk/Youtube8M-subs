00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:09.520
 this week we discover sensei of a 

00:00:07.269 --> 00:00:12.549
 netflix series created by the watchers who 

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:14.410
 yes what they achieved matrix then a 

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:16.420
 big package of good but hey they have 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:20.890
 still done matrix and that that 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:21.910
 forgive everything so sensei it's 

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:23.830
 the story of eight characters 

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:27.330
 scattered to it corners of the world that to 

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:27.330
 from a given moment shares everything 

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.539
 emotion skills and can even get 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:36.249
 speak as if they were side by side 

00:00:33.539 --> 00:00:38.109
 we discover afterwards that the group 

00:00:36.249 --> 00:00:43.050
 is hunted by nasty not nice 

00:00:38.109 --> 00:00:45.249
 at all but then not nice at all 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.690
 the senses itif that's how we 

00:00:45.249 --> 00:00:48.280
 call the heroes yes I know in 

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.199
 French is not very pretty so 

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.179
 have to cooperate to get out of there 

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:53.859
 as much to warn you right now 

00:00:52.179 --> 00:01:00.609
 the beginning is as exciting as 

00:00:53.859 --> 00:01:00.909
 dinner with skye and more 

00:01:00.609 --> 00:01:03.760
 no 

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:05.229
 own accomplishment but banal cuma fund 

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:06.970
 philosophical speech new wave 

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:08.770
 simplistic and damn characters 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.180
 clichÃ©s the Korean is strong in arts 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.020
 martial indians sing and dance 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:13.299
 Bollywood Tale 

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:15.850
 not to mention antonio banderas forgiveness in 

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:17.860
 do they call themselves litho ok ok that's it 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.149
 a little scary we say we like to arms 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.149
 watchers who still screwed up 

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:23.619
 a good idea but not as and when 

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:25.420
 measuring episodes we focus on 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:27.009
 characters we realize that they 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.320
 are much more interesting as the 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:30.729
 believed that the concept of sensory is 

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:32.920
 much more than a scenario pretense 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:34.899
 is that it allows epic scenes 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:36.789
 when a character is in danger 

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:39.780
 the mafia takes control of his body 

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:39.780
 to handle the shootings 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:45.020
 then it's coffee tour at just 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:47.240
 take the hand during the race 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:53.840
 pursuit and sun to make his 

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:55.670
 fists during the battles ouaga then is 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:58.759
 what it's worth to watch these 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.659
 corn that we say it will not please 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:01.490
 everybody 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:03.470
 strangely all the characters speak 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:04.250
 that English yes even in korea in berlin or 

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:06.950
 in Kenya 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:09.020
 woodstock is long and it may seem 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.780
 a little empty but once everything 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.880
 racing it remains stuck to the sofa 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.440
 bo is excellent and the watchers who get 

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:18.730
 even allow some TV moments 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.730
 completely or what the fuck 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.890
 originally planned to last five 

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:25.720
 seasons we hope it's not there 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:27.190
 will find his audience as the watchers who 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:30.540
 will not fall again in 

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:30.540
 a two- ball philosophical delirium 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:37.660
 in any case it is undoubtedly the 

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:39.820
 best creation of the two directors 

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:41.470
 for about fifteen years and then 

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:43.090
 all those characters who share their 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.390
 emotions with people at the other end of the 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:45.280
 world 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.970
 it's a sacred metaphor for the series 

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:47.970
 telly no 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:51.510
 m 

00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:00.030
 in the morning
