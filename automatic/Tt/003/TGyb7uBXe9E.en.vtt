00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.970 
most fluffy possible eggs so you'll see
that<00:00:35.460> we<00:00:35.670> turn<00:00:36.030> it<00:00:36.149> down<00:00:36.270> here<00:00:36.570> right<00:00:36.719> away<00:00:36.980> but

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
that we turn it down here right away but

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.170 
that we turn it down here right away but
it's<00:00:38.129> already<00:00:38.520> made<00:00:39.390> a<00:00:39.420> little<00:00:40.520> solidness<00:00:41.520> so

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
it's already made a little solidness so

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.910 
it's already made a little solidness so
we<00:00:42.300> just<00:00:42.590> pull<00:00:43.590> it<00:00:43.680> in<00:00:43.860> as<00:00:44.670> we<00:00:44.969> do<00:00:45.090> this<00:00:45.270> gently

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:45.920 
we just pull it in as we do this gently

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.139 
we just pull it in as we do this gently
you<00:00:46.920> know<00:00:46.950> I<00:00:47.039> want<00:00:47.160> to<00:00:47.250> mess<00:00:47.550> around<00:00:47.730> with<00:00:47.940> it

00:00:48.139 --> 00:00:48.149 
you know I want to mess around with it

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:51.740 
you know I want to mess around with it
too<00:00:48.360> much<00:00:48.710> and<00:00:49.710> just<00:00:50.550> as<00:00:50.700> it's<00:00:50.910> heating<00:00:51.449> here

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
too much and just as it's heating here

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.830 
too much and just as it's heating here
then<00:00:52.190> we<00:00:53.190> just<00:00:53.340> bring<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:53.879> solid<00:00:54.239> parts<00:00:54.539> to

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
then we just bring the solid parts to

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.610 
then we just bring the solid parts to
the<00:00:55.050> center<00:00:55.379> just<00:00:56.719> gently<00:00:57.719> do<00:00:57.989> that<00:00:58.199> and<00:00:58.469> then

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.180 
the center just gently do that and then
that<00:00:58.800> allows<00:00:59.100> the<00:00:59.670> raw<00:01:00.180> egg<00:01:00.480> to<00:01:01.010> rush<00:01:02.010> around

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
that allows the raw egg to rush around

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:12.859 
that allows the raw egg to rush around
and<00:01:02.910> get<00:01:03.059> on<00:01:03.300> this<00:01:03.449> hot<00:01:03.840> skillet
