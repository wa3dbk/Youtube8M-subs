 of pregnant women because it intervenes in 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.150
 the processes of division and 

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:13.830
 cell multiplication that take place 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.199
 in the first months of pregnancy 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.600
 also contributes in the production of 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.369
 red and white blood cells in the synthesis 

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.939
 genetic material and training

 minerals such as potassium and magnesium 

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:34.020
 favor a rapid recovery 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.329
 physics minimize the risk of injury and 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:39.239
 to replenish the loss of glucose water 

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:41.340
 and electrolytes during exercise the 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:43.010
 orange is a potent antioxidant the 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.510
 joint action of vitamin c 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:47.760
 flavonoids and beta-carotene exert a 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:49.250
 powerful antioxidant function fighting 

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.539
 the action of free radicals 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.789
 substances responsible for development 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:56.699
 of cardiovascular diseases 

00:00:52.789 --> 00:00:59.010
 degenerative and cancer the orange 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.690
 Vitamin C contributes its richness of vitamin 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.210
 c helps the formation of collagen 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:05.040
 bones and teeth red blood cells and 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.720
 favors the absorption of iron from 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.600
 food and resistance 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.580
 infections a glass of orange processed 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.440
 It provides almost 100% 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:16.170
 vitamin c requirements of a 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:18.090
 healthy adult person gastritis and ulcers

 beneficial for the stomach being 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.300
 able to regulate the functions of it 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.030
 avoiding many anomalies like gastritis 

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:29.220
 and gastroduodenal ulcers in these 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:31.110
 cases avoid varieties of oranges 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.210
 more acidic because they can produce more 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.100
 discomfort what benefits in this case 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:37.620
 enhance the nervous and muscular system 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.390
 consuming orange the potassium present 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:41.010
 in the orange is necessary for the 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.560
 transmission and generation of momentum 

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:45.630
 nervous for muscle activity in 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:47.600
 general and intervenes in the balance of 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.190
 water inside and outside the cell 

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.170
 consume orange favors the system 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:54.000
 digestive magnesium is a mineral that 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.940
 It is related to the functioning of the 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.380
 intestine nerves and muscles are part 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.960
 in the development of bones and teeth 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:04.020

 iron absorption in case of anemia 

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:10.229
 Ferropenic vitamin C contained in 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.090
 the orange markedly increases the 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:13.350
 absorption of iron and this accelerates the 

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.630
 Recovery 

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.730

 flavonoids and beta-carotene and fiber that 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.610
 together they help decrease the 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.500
 bad cholesterol ldl and prevent this 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:31.710
 is deposited in the walls of the vessels 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:33.660
 blood orange is diuretic

 diuretic effect of the orange arises to 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:37.920
 from its high water content 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:40.440
 potassium and citric acid that alkalizes 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.540
 the urine this is convenient in 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:44.790
 case of gout and kidney stones because 

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:47.100
 favors the elimination of uric acid and 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:49.260
 its salts and in cases of hypertension 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:52.320
 arterial or other associated diseases 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:54.030
 to fluid retention consult your

 has alkalizing properties this 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.650
 supposes an aid in the purification of the 

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:06.480
 blood since it dissolves acids and 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.490
 prevents them from settling in 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:11.640
 kidneys and produce kidney stones 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:13.830
 or kidney stones however the acid 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:16.080
 oxalic containing oranges can 

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:18.540
 form salts with certain minerals like 

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:20.190
 calcium and form calcium oxalate by 

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:22.230
 what your consumption has to have

 kidney failure situation juice 

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:31.950
 Orange helps produce more quantity 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.390
 of bile which is very advantageous for 

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:36.210
 the people who suffer from 

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:38.310
 bile failure however the 

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:39.960
 people suffering from kidney failure 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:42.420
 and that require special diets 

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:44.750
 controlled in potassium should moderate 

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.750
 the consumption
