00:00:01.009 --> 00:00:05.229
 here the WTV looked and that today they have the Medion Akoya 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.539
 12 22 and we here here he already sees a foam she's known 

00:00:10.539 --> 00:00:12.949
 I completely disassembled it 

00:00:12.949 --> 00:00:16.179
 Although I had reassembled without the screws so that now 

00:00:16.179 --> 00:00:17.829
 can make faster for you 

00:00:17.829 --> 00:00:21.489
 "But I've shown depending on the subject estate swap the guys off 

00:00:21.489 --> 00:00:22.499
 can exchange 

00:00:22.499 --> 00:00:25.589
 and what you actually find in it 

00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:28.589
 around the man is completely disassembled and though off 

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:31.169
 there is a surprise 

00:00:31.169 --> 00:00:37.370
 Bremen around it is not before Messier poses so 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:39.280
 proven in any case 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.670
 to the hard drive from the Volt or the main memory two 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.920
 To upgrade Gigabyte must begin with the adorns the battery away 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.380
 towers Cologne one drives easily into the one here 

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:53.260
 that you are pushing for percent right here bands curled that also has to 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.330
 to be pushed to the left and he can have my neck turned up quite easily 

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:57.410
 away 

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.710
 that was AP's simplest part of the whole 

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:02.960
 but otherwise the manual wants to do research 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.000
 Mußmann 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.740
 Percent also a few screws, unfortunately, it is altogether 

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:10.160
 must do without one 6 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:11.300
 15 pieces 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:12.960
 Remove Müstair 

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.090
 but it is not difficult because they are all under the keyboard 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.450
 the keyboard can be removed 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.560
 just by using a plastic card that does not necessarily use Altit 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.670
 Moll Tieres set free admission to the club for example 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.000
 I'll just leave it 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.290
 Percent just the URL the depth but taste 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:33.160
 we have so small here 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.830
 we choose Bezos in the double where the routes are held 

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.960
 and to you the battery of the Chiemgau because you here with Dr 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.690
 It could easily be easier for Mikat and the tropical could be the mark of every child 

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:44.840
 Result is deceptive 

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.860
 just here then through the weather map 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.920
 and then if the whole thing is already a bit high with me is now one 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.830
 Little bit of a bit of patience, but otherwise here at the 

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:56.990
 Page if it does not want to go up even with the card too long 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.250
 go and then it works and then lift here so high 

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.550
 and the cable just here 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:06.190
 grow from what big ions are to an inside 

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.099
 with me I'm in it so infected 

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:12.289
 Rocket no problem if it just pulls out 

00:02:12.289 --> 00:02:15.069
 and then I sit here so valuable metal cover 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:16.949
 with many four screws 

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:18.840
 and there are 1 here 

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.840
 Szmal 3 4 

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:23.620
 6 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.249
 7 8 

00:02:25.249 --> 00:02:27.119
 9 see 

00:02:27.119 --> 00:02:31.400
 11 12 13 14 15 screwdrivers loss percent 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.739
 and now may have overlooked 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:34.619
 on him wrong room who sows 

00:02:34.619 --> 00:02:38.559
 in order not necessarily remove here for example not and also the 

00:02:38.559 --> 00:02:39.849
 not from this 

00:02:39.849 --> 00:02:42.869
 unless you want it to completely disassemble just just those 

00:02:42.869 --> 00:02:45.119
 we have sent screws here 

00:02:45.119 --> 00:02:47.579
 Porta hold that would have to take out 

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:48.649
 and then 

00:02:48.649 --> 00:02:52.099
 Simply that defenders take for example an estimated lift 

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:54.669
 try up here 

00:02:54.669 --> 00:02:57.669
 to get it because here is also a cost 

00:02:58.629 --> 00:03:01.469
 and then it's like that too 

00:03:01.469 --> 00:03:04.849
 I lose both such actions a bit of skin but half as wild that 

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:06.469
 Mike likes for others 

00:03:06.469 --> 00:03:10.289
 and then you can quickly know the frame is a gigabyte ahead 

00:03:10.289 --> 00:03:13.589
 Swissbit two Kia have two of them could put Max in 

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:19.499
 with 800 megahertz or 607 60 hardens now ddr2 so-dimm it must be 

00:03:20.149 --> 00:03:22.239
 but also other ComCom report 

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:25.259
 You can find the spa from Kingston or Corser 

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:28.839
 which corresponds with models like a box otherwise we have the 52 here 

00:03:28.839 --> 00:03:32.089
 each is taxed plate which was also fastened here with a screw 

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:34.509
 you can just do that here 

00:03:34.509 --> 00:03:37.619
 to lift up and pull out 

00:03:37.619 --> 00:03:39.139
 and so 

00:03:39.139 --> 00:03:40.319
 and she is free 

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:44.419
 and she could see what the fall helped Scorpion 

00:03:44.419 --> 00:03:45.059
 Blum 

00:03:45.059 --> 00:03:47.519
 I'm always pretty fast now 

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:51.900
 and then here is the Intel Atom chip complete without heb-Alb or 

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:54.409
 if something else so 

00:03:54.409 --> 00:03:58.150
 since the wind was not really cool and Jacmel Bluetooth and w-lan adapter 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:02.509
 then stoke but what does she do now if, for example 

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:05.779
 Percent of Jews wanted to swap something down here is still hidden 

00:04:05.779 --> 00:04:09.519
 a free pci-e unfortunately nothing works but op Plaz as well as already at 

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:11.329
 Samsung in 51 a year 

00:04:11.329 --> 00:04:13.739
 for example, the edition is known 

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:17.879
 or you certainly want to see the Investor Box, I know 

00:04:17.879 --> 00:04:20.439
 to recognize on the pictures even at all times 

00:04:20.439 --> 00:04:23.459
 express may look at high-resolution images but if you second in the 

00:04:23.459 --> 00:04:24.889
 Enclosure no one wants to come 

00:04:24.889 --> 00:04:26.620
 really should have all the shop removed 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:29.120
 here every 15 or 16 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.169
 then shut down the device and down here 

00:04:32.169 --> 00:04:35.960
 again six pieces remove these six pieces are unfortunately behind 

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:39.000
 Percent partially projected such images away 

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:43.659
 Here are two thick rubber studs in it just have to pull out 

00:04:43.659 --> 00:04:46.999
 and down here these are so beautiful 

00:04:46.999 --> 00:04:49.929
 smaller I do not know how to bring that closer or that's it 

00:04:49.929 --> 00:04:50.699
 loses 

00:04:50.699 --> 00:04:53.669
 at 12 with too small plastic lid 

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:55.180
 taped 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:57.860
 it is easy to take it off I've got that I'm sorry and weak 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:04:58.800
 ruler 

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:01.939
 in the tweezers or so it will certainly be synonymous and thereunder but also 

00:05:01.939 --> 00:05:03.510
 these standards screws here 

00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:04.809
 between long ones 

00:05:04.809 --> 00:05:07.339
 the grammy-winners this way only on the hard drive 

00:05:07.339 --> 00:05:10.620
 they would not bother us now and make the ideal choice 

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:12.969
 then you would have to start with the cases 

00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:15.219
 here upper percent 

00:05:15.219 --> 00:05:18.879
 since that is quite outstanding with having accompanied again, another one means we 

00:05:18.879 --> 00:05:20.150
 not necessarily want to use 

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:21.740
 already in August SK run 

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:24.449
 to enter here in this way 

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:27.449
 and best of all where it is not necessarily such a guy you 

00:05:27.449 --> 00:05:30.379
 Women you can look ahead and then just here 

00:05:30.379 --> 00:05:31.669
 stand us 

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:33.800
 and with something more violent 

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:35.490
 Press no 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:38.759
 and tried 

00:05:38.759 --> 00:05:41.759
 all four think I solve contact points 

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:48.439
 Unterberger continues on 

00:05:48.439 --> 00:05:51.439
 Can enter the mix of Calle that finally practical 

00:05:52.979 --> 00:05:55.979
 Solve solve and here on this page too 

00:05:57.089 --> 00:05:59.490
 and then that works should already be so nice up here 

00:05:59.490 --> 00:06:00.830
 the route can 

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:02.460
 Problem it now 

00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:05.690
 Here at the hand switch SID of destruction here one switch 

00:06:06.259 --> 00:06:08.729
 By means of this there is also a contact point based on the one 

00:06:08.729 --> 00:06:10.300
 Side also with the hinges 

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:12.719
 unfortunately there should be something here 

00:06:12.719 --> 00:06:15.819
 to carry out the difficult action second regulation 

00:06:16.789 --> 00:06:17.969
 was us 

00:06:17.969 --> 00:06:21.369
 Now it can work so much, I just keep on pulling up 

00:06:21.369 --> 00:06:23.430
 Of course it is something to him 

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:25.240
 Hausen was relaxed 

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:27.669
 and then pull Mittermeier up 

00:06:27.669 --> 00:06:29.300
 and you almost think 

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:32.689
 the device or the housing was broken 

00:06:32.689 --> 00:06:35.689
 but when you buy once the whole then but from 

00:06:36.309 --> 00:06:39.749
 not per 4, the understanding on the left AZ suggests already solved 

00:06:39.749 --> 00:06:41.719
 professional Tuesday after too 

00:06:41.719 --> 00:06:44.719
 Unfortunately, Wai Velen is easier 

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:46.719
 the children see 

00:06:46.719 --> 00:06:49.269
 so Schopper its bottom out I have now yes that can not yet 

00:06:49.269 --> 00:06:50.180
 turned on by 

00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:53.569
 from Perth but the value has been here as well 

00:06:53.569 --> 00:06:56.689
 what he can just pull out and here could be the whole thing 

00:06:56.689 --> 00:06:58.860
 Talk can 

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:02.330
 as already said here is the ETA people from 50 pieces "Here is the 

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:06.099
 free space for the PC the madly proud of course that's also the talker 

00:07:06.099 --> 00:07:07.439
 is the card reader 

00:07:07.439 --> 00:07:09.059
 Connection of course 

00:07:09.059 --> 00:07:13.199
 a local anti-rust for a huge BIOS battery we still have 

00:07:13.199 --> 00:07:17.949
 here is the graphics unit so the animals was a 30 50 chip 

00:07:17.949 --> 00:07:20.870
 and the rest I've already thought so without me here now 

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:22.119
 Upper Town has made 

00:07:22.119 --> 00:07:25.969
 what I do not understand is this fan Boskovic this forest youth it 

00:07:25.969 --> 00:07:28.899
 demarcated so here now pulls off no air 

00:07:28.899 --> 00:07:31.899
 only does not really have space so theoretically seen 

00:07:32.529 --> 00:07:36.629
 Per cent if your all the Brit want to be minute I would expand this 

00:07:36.629 --> 00:07:38.219
 That saves you 

00:07:38.219 --> 00:07:39.580
 for space 

00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:40.460
 and Sierre
