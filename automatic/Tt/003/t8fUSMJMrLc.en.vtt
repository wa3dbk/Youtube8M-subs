00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:07.220
 the stallion 

00:00:11.329 --> 00:00:14.329
 si 

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:18.180
 we show today that the middle game would have scored 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.730
 from the Fed 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:24.240
 Michels Lexa is about it as with all the field players per cent that we the 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.380
 Game concepts their what was increased in difficulty degrees 

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:29.919
 Kuhnt percent fun places and places 

00:00:29.919 --> 00:00:32.789
 but that includes making somersaults hit a sweat 

00:00:32.789 --> 00:00:33.680
 come 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.010
 and gets us mixed up 

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:38.490
 and still percent 

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:42.160
 The fun of whether the door is set on Indian stock market money is about it 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.600
 that the AXA itself mourns 10 potions 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.740
 since she has forgotten one ingredient each, there are ten different ones 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:52.690
 Ingredients So there are always just one ingredient to hold in these little ingredients 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.540
 we want to find out together and indeed 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:59.310
 As soon as possible which ingredients a particular continues I would 

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:00.740
 throws 

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:03.200
 in the said 1 the AXA goes one step 

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.310
 and look in the 

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:07.310
 Pott before the whole I do but in thought 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.600
 The dice are covered and each player tries it in the head 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.610
 to walk this step virtually 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.710
 Look in the cauldron and then quickly says which ingredient is missing 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:19.900
 then the whole thing is checked 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.950
 Witch runs 1 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.950
 it is said what could be and we need to check 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:28.970
 and the snail is right 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:31.280
 There is a small but fine reward 

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:32.900
 and the game continues 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.430
 if the kids are percent 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.860
 Cech have conveyed this principle to a degree that is almost internalized 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.729
 Increase cascades a little bit by himself 

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:42.930
 Various other dice games bring through four different dice 

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:46.110
 So the game is adjustable in modular difficulty 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.990
 One possibility would be to change direction next 

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.950
 I wish he brings us witch goes clockwise or the witch is running 

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.190
 counterclockwise 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:56.520
 we do that too 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.870
 successively 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:01.870
 cover it up and that too will be in your head again 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.390
 Mandated I must give you a spark again 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.379
 by the way, that does not look bad because if I punished 

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:11.659
 This principle is also internalized 

00:02:11.659 --> 00:02:13.889
 the more one step further 

00:02:13.889 --> 00:02:15.309
 and then ask questions 

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:19.839
 looks at the witch in the cauldron in front of her or looks at the witch in the cauldron 

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:20.979
 behind 

00:02:20.979 --> 00:02:23.649
 also that he rolled out again 

00:02:23.649 --> 00:02:25.569
 one simulates with 1 

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:28.770
 covered and we draw that so they always see ghost species so seen 

00:02:29.299 --> 00:02:32.139
 I remember she must be 1 4 

00:02:32.139 --> 00:02:36.210
 clockwise in Kassel in front of him so it shows that could be so 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:39.780
 In the case is that I have to go shortly after seeing this person at the cactus 

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:44.919
 and I'm right, that's another point 

00:02:44.919 --> 00:02:48.599
 although that is internalized but which will take a while because 

00:02:48.599 --> 00:02:50.730
 that is Brigitte also speed and thus 

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:51.849
 Richard Oswald 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:55.840
 Percent but still funny Add the last step to the Flex 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:56.729
 Fox 

00:02:56.729 --> 00:02:58.949
 the text Socks is the mascot of the pond 

00:02:58.949 --> 00:03:02.759
 and worries she was the last confusing one for the last step but per 

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:04.889
 from Holland should be the most exciting Stofer 

00:03:04.889 --> 00:03:06.960
 Also in the game it is so the Fed fox 

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:09.469
 into the goal of a Monza but what in this game 

00:03:09.469 --> 00:03:10.800
 whereas the witch 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:14.930
 the Sterns Habermann is "The whole web presented on the may of the says 

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:17.829
 which of both characters the next train appeal 

00:03:17.829 --> 00:03:20.039
 the simulated times 

00:03:20.039 --> 00:03:23.039
 this result the Fed Cup stands for the 4th 

00:03:23.739 --> 00:03:26.090
 Texts are there and that would be discarded Zentner 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:30.060
 Uni would have to copy this now in his mind and get out Lord what that 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.959
 The result is the problem with the Fex Fox but percent he is even more freaky 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:37.830
 as the firefight itself and therefore makes a statement in reverse until 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:40.830
 Of course, he does that exactly as he understands 

00:03:41.939 --> 00:03:45.629
 in this case, he does not run these cubes 2 clockwise 

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:47.449
 counterclockwise 

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:49.059
 like that 

00:03:49.059 --> 00:03:52.850
 and PrÃ¶ll would not have the kettle in front of him, so it's about time 

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:56.310
 but he understands the cauldron behind his mind 

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:59.909
 1 2 3 refers to this hit 

00:03:59.909 --> 00:04:03.930
 and he additionally makes the mistake of not finding the end ingredient 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:08.680
 He finds out the ingredients that are twice the pot in the pot 

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.570
 Case I say bold 

00:04:10.570 --> 00:04:13.159
 that's the sticking point 

00:04:13.159 --> 00:04:16.239
 all Kundert look it is actually the cactus here too 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:16.809
 the point 

00:04:16.809 --> 00:04:18.180
 we can play the game so 

00:04:18.180 --> 00:04:21.759
 to the requirements percent of the child or even adulthood ever 

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:24.680
 if you are short or long on the day of the fair you play with more 

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:26.169
 or no longer dice with less
