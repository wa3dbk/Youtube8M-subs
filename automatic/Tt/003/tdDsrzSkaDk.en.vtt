frequently used gun in the game and I

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:11.780 
frequently used gun in the game and I
thought<00:00:10.800> for<00:00:10.980> the<00:00:11.040> longest<00:00:11.070> time<00:00:11.340> it<00:00:11.550> be<00:00:11.670> the

thought for the longest time it be the
opie<00:00:12.030> weapon<00:00:12.330> but<00:00:12.420> it's<00:00:12.570> not<00:00:12.750> it's<00:00:12.929> not<00:00:13.080> even

the<00:00:13.380> best<00:00:13.469> assault<00:00:13.830> rifle<00:00:14.130> it's<00:00:14.250> just<00:00:14.429> a<00:00:14.519> good

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:14.849 
the best assault rifle it's just a good

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:17.000 
the best assault rifle it's just a good
assault<00:00:15.630> rifle<00:00:15.870> it's<00:00:16.049> a<00:00:16.080> good<00:00:16.230> weapon<00:00:16.379> and<00:00:16.680> it

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:17.010 
assault rifle it's a good weapon and it

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.800 
assault rifle it's a good weapon and it
has<00:00:17.100> its<00:00:17.250> niche<00:00:17.760> but<00:00:18.029> it's<00:00:18.210> not<00:00:18.330> the<00:00:18.390> best<00:00:18.539> for

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
has its niche but it's not the best for

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:20.660 
has its niche but it's not the best for
everything<00:00:19.170> you<00:00:19.289> know<00:00:19.470> fully<00:00:19.680> gets<00:00:19.920> that<00:00:20.160> in

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
everything you know fully gets that in

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.519 
everything you know fully gets that in
this<00:00:20.820> video<00:00:21.060> so<00:00:21.779> basically<00:00:21.990> this<00:00:22.109> gameplay<00:00:22.350> is

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:22.529 
this video so basically this gameplay is

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:24.109 
this video so basically this gameplay is
I<00:00:22.920> think<00:00:23.160> it's<00:00:23.279> only<00:00:23.369> twenty<00:00:23.760> five<00:00:23.850> to<00:00:24.090> twenty

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
I think it's only twenty five to twenty

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.109 
I think it's only twenty five to twenty
five<00:00:24.779> on<00:00:25.140> a<00:00:25.170> Stonehaven<00:00:26.160> and<00:00:26.279> that's<00:00:26.670> against

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
five on a Stonehaven and that's against

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:28.460 
five on a Stonehaven and that's against
really<00:00:27.359> bad<00:00:27.539> people<00:00:28.019> but<00:00:28.109> it's<00:00:28.230> one<00:00:28.320> of<00:00:28.380> those

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
really bad people but it's one of those

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.200 
really bad people but it's one of those
game<00:00:28.650> so<00:00:28.830> it's<00:00:28.980> like<00:00:29.099> I<00:00:29.250> don't<00:00:29.310> know<00:00:29.640> how<00:00:29.820> I<00:00:29.849> did

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
game so it's like I don't know how I did

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.150 
game so it's like I don't know how I did
well<00:00:30.449> but<00:00:30.630> let's<00:00:30.779> let's<00:00:31.349> upload<00:00:31.529> this<00:00:31.800> anyway

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:32.160 
well but let's let's upload this anyway

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.490 
well but let's let's upload this anyway
and<00:00:32.189> see<00:00:32.430> what<00:00:32.579> people<00:00:32.880> think<00:00:32.910> so<00:00:33.390> it's<00:00:34.380> when

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
and see what people think so it's when

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:35.540 
and see what people think so it's when
the<00:00:34.590> game<00:00:34.739> first<00:00:34.770> came<00:00:35.040> out<00:00:35.219> and<00:00:35.340> I've<00:00:35.430> been

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
the game first came out and I've been

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.280 
the game first came out and I've been
playing<00:00:35.700> for<00:00:35.850> a<00:00:35.910> couple<00:00:36.000> days<00:00:36.239> already<00:00:36.390> so

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
playing for a couple days already so

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.720 
playing for a couple days already so
that's<00:00:37.469> why<00:00:37.739> everyone's<00:00:37.980> so<00:00:38.129> bad<00:00:38.399> it's<00:00:38.579> not<00:00:38.640> we

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
that's why everyone's so bad it's not we

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:39.830 
that's why everyone's so bad it's not we
playing<00:00:38.940> squads<00:00:39.239> a<00:00:39.300> lot<00:00:39.390> of<00:00:39.450> people<00:00:39.629> think

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:39.840 
playing squads a lot of people think

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:41.780 
playing squads a lot of people think
that<00:00:40.050> up<00:00:40.260> from<00:00:40.590> my<00:00:40.680> day<00:00:40.739> one<00:00:40.980> game<00:00:41.129> list<00:00:41.430> it's

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790 
that up from my day one game list it's

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.040 
that up from my day one game list it's
just<00:00:41.940> everyone<00:00:42.180> not<00:00:42.390> understanding<00:00:42.809> the<00:00:42.870> map

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050 
just everyone not understanding the map

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.680 
just everyone not understanding the map
so<00:00:43.260> me<00:00:43.379> taking<00:00:44.360> advantage<00:00:45.360> but<00:00:45.539> still

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:45.690 
so me taking advantage but still

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:46.940 
so me taking advantage but still
managing<00:00:46.140> to<00:00:46.170> do<00:00:46.320> pretty<00:00:46.500> well<00:00:46.590> so<00:00:46.829> that's

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
managing to do pretty well so that's

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.860 
managing to do pretty well so that's
what<00:00:47.100> this<00:00:47.190> gameplay<00:00:47.399> is<00:00:47.550> and<00:00:47.879> yes<00:00:48.420> let's<00:00:48.719> get

answer<00:00:53.370> and<00:00:53.520> I<00:00:53.579> dub<00:00:53.730> I<00:00:53.850> did<00:00:54.000> my<00:00:54.090> research<00:00:54.420> on

00:00:54.740 --> 00:00:54.750 
answer and I dub I did my research on

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:56.360 
answer and I dub I did my research on
you<00:00:55.140> know<00:00:55.350> the<00:00:55.469> honey<00:00:55.590> badger<00:00:55.770> versus<00:00:56.190> the<00:00:56.280> up

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
you know the honey badger versus the up

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:57.770 
you know the honey badger versus the up
weapons<00:00:56.699> in<00:00:56.820> terms<00:00:57.000> of<00:00:57.120> range<00:00:57.329> if<00:00:57.600> they're

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780 
weapons in terms of range if they're

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.029 
weapons in terms of range if they're
tree<00:00:57.960> at<00:00:58.050> Sun<00:00:58.230> so<00:00:58.379> she<00:00:58.410> takes<00:00:58.620> away<00:00:58.800> from<00:00:58.829> it

00:00:59.029 --> 00:00:59.039 
tree at Sun so she takes away from it

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:01.069 
tree at Sun so she takes away from it
and<00:00:59.280> basically<00:00:59.879> it's<00:01:00.270> kind<00:01:00.570> of<00:01:00.600> like<00:01:00.780> a<00:01:00.809> half

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
and basically it's kind of like a half

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:03.170 
and basically it's kind of like a half
sorta<00:01:01.469> like<00:01:01.680> half<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.250> penalty<00:01:02.609> from<00:01:02.850> not

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
sorta like half the penalty from not

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.479 
sorta like half the penalty from not
having<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.600> science<00:01:04.110> rod<00:01:04.260> so<00:01:04.470> it's<00:01:04.890> a<00:01:05.070> score

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
having the science rod so it's a score

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:06.620 
having the science rod so it's a score
low<00:01:05.670> less<00:01:05.850> range<00:01:06.060> than<00:01:06.119> the<00:01:06.210> other<00:01:06.360> assault

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
low less range than the other assault

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.870 
low less range than the other assault
rifles<00:01:06.659> but<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.979> like<00:01:08.369> it's<00:01:08.549> not<00:01:08.640> as<00:01:08.760> much

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
rifles but the like it's not as much

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.940 
rifles but the like it's not as much
science<00:01:09.450> it<00:01:09.540> would<00:01:09.630> take<00:01:09.780> off<00:01:09.960> but<00:01:10.439> there's<00:01:10.770> no

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
science it would take off but there's no

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.770 
science it would take off but there's no
way<00:01:11.310> to<00:01:11.340> burn<00:01:11.580> muzzle<00:01:11.880> brake<00:01:12.030> on<00:01:12.240> to<00:01:12.479> pull<00:01:12.689> it

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
way to burn muzzle brake on to pull it

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.179 
way to burn muzzle brake on to pull it
you<00:01:12.900> know<00:01:13.020> extra<00:01:13.470> twenty<00:01:13.650> percent<00:01:13.920> like<00:01:14.070> they

one<00:01:25.740> to<00:01:25.920> use

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
one to use

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.950 
one to use
so<00:01:26.850> yeah<00:01:26.970> let's<00:01:27.180> go<00:01:27.299> right<00:01:27.509> into<00:01:27.540> why<00:01:27.930> I

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
so yeah let's go right into why I

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.300 
so yeah let's go right into why I
recommend<00:01:28.439> actually<00:01:28.740> using<00:01:28.950> on<00:01:29.009> this<00:01:29.159> weapon

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
recommend actually using on this weapon

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.760 
recommend actually using on this weapon
and<00:01:29.640> why<00:01:29.790> it's<00:01:29.939> so<00:01:30.119> nice<00:01:30.270> so<00:01:30.509> basically<00:01:30.869> as<00:01:31.530> far

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
and why it's so nice so basically as far

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.380 
and why it's so nice so basically as far
as<00:01:31.890> the<00:01:32.310> science'<00:01:32.670> goes<00:01:32.820> it's<00:01:33.030> already<00:01:33.270> got

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
as the science' goes it's already got

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.630 
as the science' goes it's already got
one<00:01:33.479> bow<00:01:33.630> in<00:01:33.810> as<00:01:34.020> far<00:01:34.320> as<00:01:34.380> sights<00:01:34.650> go<00:01:34.860> I<00:01:35.100> do<00:01:35.400> not

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
one bow in as far as sights go I do not

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.580 
one bow in as far as sights go I do not
like<00:01:35.850> any<00:01:36.060> sights<00:01:36.390> on<00:01:36.540> this<00:01:36.659> weapon<00:01:36.810> if<00:01:37.140> you<00:01:37.350> I

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:37.590 
like any sights on this weapon if you I

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.679 
like any sights on this weapon if you I
tried<00:01:37.860> using<00:01:38.070> a<00:01:38.400> holographic<00:01:38.909> I'd<00:01:39.270> used<00:01:39.570> an

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
tried using a holographic I'd used an

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.510 
tried using a holographic I'd used an
ACOG<00:01:40.020> for<00:01:40.200> an<00:01:40.290> obit<00:01:40.590> and<00:01:40.770> I<00:01:40.979> also<00:01:41.100> use<00:01:41.280> a<00:01:41.310> red

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
ACOG for an obit and I also use a red

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.080 
ACOG for an obit and I also use a red
dot<00:01:42.560> none<00:01:43.560> of<00:01:43.680> them<00:01:43.860> really<00:01:44.070> did<00:01:44.399> what<00:01:44.820> I<00:01:44.850> want

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
dot none of them really did what I want

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.249 
dot none of them really did what I want
them<00:01:45.210> to<00:01:45.240> do<00:01:45.390> I<00:01:45.509> keep<00:01:45.659> in<00:01:45.750> a<00:01:45.810> red<00:01:45.960> dot<00:01:46.170> I

00:01:46.249 --> 00:01:46.259 
them to do I keep in a red dot I

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.080 
them to do I keep in a red dot I
actually<00:01:46.740> prefer<00:01:47.070> the<00:01:47.430> iron<00:01:47.579> sights<00:01:47.820> to<00:01:47.909> a<00:01:47.970> red

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
actually prefer the iron sights to a red

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.340 
actually prefer the iron sights to a red
dot<00:01:48.240> because<00:01:48.509> even<00:01:48.720> though<00:01:48.780> I<00:01:48.810> love<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.200> red

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350 
dot because even though I love the red

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:50.510 
dot because even though I love the red
dot<00:01:49.530> you<00:01:49.680> know<00:01:49.710> that<00:01:50.040> if<00:01:50.130> you've<00:01:50.220> seen<00:01:50.399> these

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:50.520 
dot you know that if you've seen these

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.819 
dot you know that if you've seen these
videos<00:01:50.990> something<00:01:51.990> about<00:01:52.259> these<00:01:52.380> iron<00:01:52.590> sights

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
videos something about these iron sights

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.380 
videos something about these iron sights
just<00:01:53.040> work<00:01:53.310> at<00:01:53.579> the<00:01:53.729> range<00:01:53.909> this<00:01:54.060> weapons

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
just work at the range this weapons

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:55.880 
just work at the range this weapons
let's<00:01:54.540> do<00:01:54.689> because<00:01:54.930> this<00:01:55.079> out<00:01:55.229> it<00:01:55.380> has<00:01:55.590> a<00:01:55.619> lot

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.890 
let's do because this out it has a lot

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.190 
let's do because this out it has a lot
of<00:01:55.950> kick<00:01:56.159> at<00:01:56.399> long<00:01:56.549> ranges<00:01:56.909> but<00:01:57.570> close<00:01:57.780> ranges

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
of kick at long ranges but close ranges

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.569 
of kick at long ranges but close ranges
the<00:01:58.469> iron<00:01:58.680> sights<00:01:58.950> just<00:01:59.040> seem<00:01:59.280> to<00:01:59.399> track

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
the iron sights just seem to track

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:00.950 
the iron sights just seem to track
targets<00:01:59.820> better<00:02:00.240> you<00:02:00.630> know<00:02:00.750> there's

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
targets better you know there's

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.450 
targets better you know there's
something<00:02:01.079> about<00:02:01.200> them<00:02:01.590> maybe<00:02:02.219> it's<00:02:02.369> those

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460

red dot buy it recommend trying to use

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:11.270 
red dot buy it recommend trying to use
the<00:02:10.050> iron<00:02:10.170> sights<00:02:10.470> first<00:02:10.770> because<00:02:11.099> they're

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
the iron sights first because they're

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.250 
the iron sights first because they're
really<00:02:11.489> really<00:02:11.819> good<00:02:11.910> iron<00:02:12.030> sights<00:02:12.330> they<00:02:12.989> work

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
really really good iron sights they work

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.180 
really really good iron sights they work
on<00:02:13.379> the<00:02:13.440> ranges<00:02:13.739> now

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:14.190 
on the ranges now

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.250 
on the ranges now
and<00:02:14.550> you<00:02:15.330> don't<00:02:15.450> really<00:02:15.660> need<00:02:15.840> them<00:02:16.050> pass<00:02:16.230> the

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:16.260 
and you don't really need them pass the

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:17.870 
and you don't really need them pass the
ranges<00:02:16.680> that<00:02:16.860> it<00:02:16.980> works<00:02:17.130> at<00:02:17.370> so<00:02:17.520> that's<00:02:17.700> what<00:02:17.850> I

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:17.880 
ranges that it works at so that's what I

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:21.290 
ranges that it works at so that's what I
recommend<00:02:18.030> their<00:02:18.390> second<00:02:19.380> full<00:02:20.090> that<00:02:21.090> means

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:21.300 
recommend their second full that means

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.020 
recommend their second full that means
that<00:02:21.510> we<00:02:21.630> now<00:02:21.780> have<00:02:21.990> to<00:02:22.620> like<00:02:23.070> perk<00:02:23.340> sorry<00:02:23.850> two

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
that we now have to like perk sorry two

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.360 
that we now have to like perk sorry two

attachments wrong reach up quipment slot

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:28.520 
attachments wrong reach up quipment slot
and<00:02:26.580> you<00:02:27.390> can<00:02:27.540> basically<00:02:27.750> pull<00:02:28.080> on<00:02:28.200> anything

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:28.530 
and you can basically pull on anything

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:30.680 
and you can basically pull on anything
you<00:02:28.980> want<00:02:29.190> or<00:02:29.370> one<00:02:29.760> from<00:02:29.970> each<00:02:30.030> category<00:02:30.330> which

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
you want or one from each category which

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:31.550 
you want or one from each category which
means<00:02:30.720> you<00:02:30.930> essentially<00:02:31.200> have<00:02:31.350> four

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
means you essentially have four

really really nice thing about it I

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:35.570 
really really nice thing about it I
think<00:02:34.530> that's<00:02:34.710> on<00:02:34.920> the<00:02:35.010> things<00:02:35.220> a<00:02:35.400> lot<00:02:35.520> of

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
think that's on the things a lot of

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.490 
think that's on the things a lot of
people<00:02:35.790> like<00:02:35.940> so<00:02:36.690> since<00:02:36.930> though<00:02:37.080> I<00:02:37.110> did<00:02:37.350> have

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:37.500 
people like so since though I did have

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:39.270 
an under barrel and a I guess it's a

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:41.630 
an under barrel and a I guess it's a
magazine<00:02:39.660> type<00:02:39.930> attachment<00:02:40.650> than<00:02:41.220> what<00:02:41.610> I

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.810 
kills the clip rather than one or two oh
yeah<00:03:16.230> that's<00:03:16.410> what<00:03:16.560> I'd<00:03:16.650> recommend<00:03:16.830> as<00:03:17.370> far<00:03:17.400> as

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
yeah that's what I'd recommend as far as

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:19.570 
yeah that's what I'd recommend as far as
the<00:03:18.180> attachments<00:03:18.660> go

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:19.580 
the attachments go

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:21.830 
the attachments go
secondaries<00:03:20.580> I<00:03:20.790> would<00:03:21.330> actually<00:03:21.600> recommend

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
secondaries I would actually recommend

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.479 
secondaries I would actually recommend
pulling<00:03:22.140> on<00:03:22.350> the<00:03:22.500> akimbo<00:03:22.830> pistol<00:03:23.220> so<00:03:23.280> this

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
pulling on the akimbo pistol so this

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:25.250 
pulling on the akimbo pistol so this
loadout<00:03:23.820> although<00:03:24.570> well<00:03:24.690> is<00:03:24.780> a<00:03:24.810> pretty<00:03:25.080> good

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:25.260 
loadout although well is a pretty good

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.229 
loadout although well is a pretty good
close-range<00:03:25.800> weapon<00:03:25.920> and<00:03:26.430> putting<00:03:27.030> out<00:03:27.150> they

00:03:27.229 --> 00:03:27.239 
close-range weapon and putting out they

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:29.060 
close-range weapon and putting out they
came<00:03:27.360> a<00:03:27.420> pistol<00:03:27.780> as<00:03:27.840> well<00:03:28.110> you<00:03:28.530> know<00:03:28.650> kind<00:03:28.950> of

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:29.070 
came a pistol as well you know kind of

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:31.220 
came a pistol as well you know kind of
make<00:03:29.250> you<00:03:29.400> lose<00:03:29.640> the<00:03:30.030> the<00:03:30.480> stope<00:03:30.750> of<00:03:30.930> it<00:03:31.080> I

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
make you lose the the stope of it I

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.130 
make you lose the the stope of it I
really<00:03:31.560> still<00:03:31.800> would<00:03:31.920> recommend<00:03:32.370> just

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:33.140 
really still would recommend just

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:36.170 
really still would recommend just
because<00:03:34.140> is<00:03:34.290> it<00:03:34.530> a<00:03:34.800> sauropod<00:03:35.430> aren't<00:03:35.970> the<00:03:36.030> best

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
because is it a sauropod aren't the best

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:37.340 
because is it a sauropod aren't the best
at<00:03:36.390> close<00:03:36.540> range<00:03:36.780> on<00:03:36.900> the<00:03:36.989> game<00:03:37.140> they<00:03:37.290> do

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
at close range on the game they do

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:39.020 
at close range on the game they do
pretty<00:03:37.950> well<00:03:38.100> with<00:03:38.250> close<00:03:38.489> range<00:03:38.820> but<00:03:38.940> you

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:39.030 
pretty well with close range but you

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:40.699 
pretty well with close range but you
want<00:03:39.180> to<00:03:39.239> have<00:03:39.360> the<00:03:39.600> you<00:03:39.840> know<00:03:39.870> just<00:03:40.260> that<00:03:40.410> neck

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
want to have the you know just that neck

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:42.199 
want to have the you know just that neck
low<00:03:40.950> back<00:03:41.130> sure<00:03:41.370> and<00:03:41.459> close<00:03:41.610> range<00:03:41.820> obviously

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
low back sure and close range obviously

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:44.090 
low back sure and close range obviously
on<00:03:42.540> the<00:03:42.630> larger<00:03:42.959> maps<00:03:43.170> you<00:03:43.320> could<00:03:43.530> forego<00:03:43.800> the

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
on the larger maps you could forego the

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:45.680 
on the larger maps you could forego the
secondaries<00:03:44.670> but<00:03:44.940> I<00:03:45.090> just<00:03:45.390> leave<00:03:45.510> them<00:03:45.660> on

00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:45.690 
secondaries but I just leave them on

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:47.270 
secondaries but I just leave them on
there<00:03:45.870> anyway<00:03:46.050> so<00:03:46.200> I'm<00:03:46.470> am<00:03:46.620> used<00:03:46.950> to<00:03:47.040> having

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
there anyway so I'm am used to having

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:48.860 
there anyway so I'm am used to having
them<00:03:47.400> there<00:03:47.430> because<00:03:48.239> swishing<00:03:48.570> out<00:03:48.660> for<00:03:48.810> each

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:48.870 
them there because swishing out for each

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:52.340 
them there because swishing out for each
map<00:03:49.080> is<00:03:49.110> difficult<00:03:49.620> so<00:03:50.510> tacticals<00:03:51.510> I<00:03:51.750> did<00:03:52.230> not

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:52.350 
map is difficult so tacticals I did not

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:53.600 
map is difficult so tacticals I did not
go<00:03:52.470> over<00:03:52.530> tactic<00:03:52.860> over<00:03:52.980> this<00:03:53.070> weapon<00:03:53.370> or<00:03:53.459> move

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
go over tactic over this weapon or move

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.070 
go over tactic over this weapon or move
since<00:03:53.760> it<00:03:53.910> is<00:03:54.000> a<00:03:54.030> sore<00:03:54.239> overage<00:03:54.630> you<00:03:54.750> could<00:03:54.930> go

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:55.080 
since it is a sore overage you could go

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.320 
since it is a sore overage you could go
over<00:03:55.140> thermobaric<00:03:55.650> grenade<00:03:56.130> or<00:03:56.790> a<00:03:56.820> nine<00:03:57.090> thing

00:03:57.320 --> 00:03:57.330 
over thermobaric grenade or a nine thing

00:03:57.330 --> 00:03:59.570 
over thermobaric grenade or a nine thing
or<00:03:57.510> something<00:03:57.930> I<00:03:58.200> really<00:03:58.950> didn't<00:03:59.190> find<00:03:59.370> them

00:03:59.570 --> 00:03:59.580 
or something I really didn't find them

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:01.430 
or something I really didn't find them
that<00:03:59.700> useful<00:03:59.910> on<00:04:00.180> the<00:04:00.269> larger<00:04:00.480> maps<00:04:00.720> but<00:04:00.989> if

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
that useful on the larger maps but if

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.259 
that useful on the larger maps but if
you're<00:04:01.620> playing<00:04:01.709> Doman<00:04:02.250> 9<00:04:02.400> bangs<00:04:02.670> always<00:04:02.970> fun

00:04:03.259 --> 00:04:03.269 
you're playing Doman 9 bangs always fun

00:04:03.269 --> 00:04:05.840 
you're playing Doman 9 bangs always fun
sort<00:04:03.959> don't<00:04:04.140> strike<00:04:04.440> zone<00:04:04.680> so<00:04:05.489> yeah<00:04:05.670> that's

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:05.850 
sort don't strike zone so yeah that's

00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:07.220 
sort don't strike zone so yeah that's
what<00:04:06.030> I'd<00:04:06.090> recommend<00:04:06.239> spars<00:04:06.660> that<00:04:06.840> goes<00:04:07.019> are

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
what I'd recommend spars that goes are

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:10.430 
what I'd recommend spars that goes are
lethal<00:04:07.650> a<00:04:07.860> c4<00:04:08.400> it's<00:04:09.180> nice<00:04:09.480> it<00:04:09.780> just<00:04:09.959> it<00:04:10.140> covers

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
lethal a c4 it's nice it just it covers

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.560 
lethal a c4 it's nice it just it covers
everything<00:04:10.680> so<00:04:11.010> well<00:04:11.250> obviously<00:04:11.970> could<00:04:12.450> trade

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:12.570 
everything so well obviously could trade

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:14.420 
everything so well obviously could trade
out<00:04:12.690> for<00:04:12.810> a<00:04:12.930> grenade<00:04:13.230> I'd<00:04:13.350> recommend<00:04:13.680> c4<00:04:14.160> just

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:14.430 
out for a grenade I'd recommend c4 just

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:15.979 
out for a grenade I'd recommend c4 just
it<00:04:14.640> works<00:04:14.850> for<00:04:15.120> everything<00:04:15.450> in<00:04:15.540> my<00:04:15.660> opinion

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:15.989 
it works for everything in my opinion

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:18.199 
it works for everything in my opinion
except<00:04:16.440> the<00:04:16.620> crazy<00:04:16.859> long<00:04:17.100> range<00:04:17.340> but<00:04:17.549> the<00:04:18.060> long

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:18.209 
except the crazy long range but the long

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:19.550 
except the crazy long range but the long
range<00:04:18.450> you<00:04:18.600> can<00:04:18.720> actually<00:04:18.870> just<00:04:19.080> kill<00:04:19.260> away<00:04:19.380> so

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
range you can actually just kill away so

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.140 
range you can actually just kill away so
it's<00:04:20.040> kind<00:04:20.340> of<00:04:20.430> the<00:04:20.549> defensive<00:04:20.970> equipment

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
it's kind of the defensive equipment

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:22.790 
it's kind of the defensive equipment
which<00:04:21.510> is<00:04:21.660> why<00:04:21.750> I<00:04:21.780> like<00:04:22.049> I<00:04:22.200> like<00:04:22.350> to<00:04:22.530> defend

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 
which is why I like I like to defend

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:23.240 
which is why I like I like to defend
myself

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
myself

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:26.029 
myself
IEDs<00:04:24.120> also<00:04:24.510> you<00:04:24.990> know<00:04:25.110> an<00:04:25.229> option<00:04:25.530> if<00:04:25.650> you<00:04:25.770> want

00:04:26.029 --> 00:04:26.039 
IEDs also you know an option if you want

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:28.040 
IEDs also you know an option if you want
to<00:04:26.130> play<00:04:26.340> stealthy<00:04:26.910> and<00:04:27.090> just

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:28.050 
to play stealthy and just

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:29.689 
to play stealthy and just
really<00:04:28.349> be<00:04:28.470> annoying<00:04:28.680> which<00:04:28.979> I<00:04:29.160> guess<00:04:29.340> is<00:04:29.520> what

00:04:29.689 --> 00:04:29.699 
really be annoying which I guess is what

00:04:29.699 --> 00:04:31.400 
really be annoying which I guess is what
some<00:04:29.879> people<00:04:30.000> don't<00:04:30.180> call<00:04:30.389> GD<00:04:30.690> I<00:04:30.900> see<00:04:31.289> that's

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:31.410 
some people don't call GD I see that's

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:33.020 
some people don't call GD I see that's
why<00:04:31.620> I'd<00:04:31.680> recommend<00:04:32.009> as<00:04:32.129> far<00:04:32.160> as<00:04:32.490> equipment

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.030 
why I'd recommend as far as equipment

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:36.830 
why I'd recommend as far as equipment
goes<00:04:33.300> so<00:04:33.710> Oaks<00:04:34.710> is<00:04:34.949> a<00:04:34.979> little<00:04:35.460> bit<00:04:35.840> interesting

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
goes so Oaks is a little bit interesting

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.240 
goes so Oaks is a little bit interesting
with<00:04:36.990> this<00:04:37.080> one<00:04:37.289> you<00:04:37.470> can<00:04:37.740> go<00:04:37.949> with<00:04:38.099> the

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:38.250 
with this one you can go with the

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:39.920 
with this one you can go with the
stealth<00:04:38.520> perks<00:04:38.819> which<00:04:39.060> kind<00:04:39.389> of<00:04:39.509> fits<00:04:39.690> the

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
stealth perks which kind of fits the

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:41.960 
stealth perks which kind of fits the
build<00:04:40.139> which<00:04:40.860> is<00:04:41.009> off<00:04:41.159> the<00:04:41.280> radar<00:04:41.490> dead

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:41.970 
build which is off the radar dead

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:44.270 
build which is off the radar dead
silence<00:04:42.449> and<00:04:42.780> takedown<00:04:43.319> I<00:04:43.349> think<00:04:43.680> but<00:04:44.250> I

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:44.280 
silence and takedown I think but I

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.159 
silence and takedown I think but I
honestly<00:04:44.550> wouldn't<00:04:44.970> recommend<00:04:45.240> it<00:04:45.479> because<00:04:45.840> I

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:46.169 
honestly wouldn't recommend it because I

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:48.260 
honestly wouldn't recommend it because I
think<00:04:46.620> you<00:04:47.009> should<00:04:47.039> maybe<00:04:47.699> strengthen<00:04:48.150> this

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:48.270 
think you should maybe strengthen this

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:50.059 
think you should maybe strengthen this
weapon<00:04:48.509> before<00:04:48.659> you<00:04:48.930> go<00:04:49.259> into<00:04:49.530> the<00:04:49.620> step<00:04:49.830> so

00:04:50.059 --> 00:04:50.069 
weapon before you go into the step so

00:04:50.069 --> 00:04:52.219 
weapon before you go into the step so
first<00:04:50.370> of<00:04:50.490> all<00:04:50.550> stalker<00:04:50.909> stalk<00:04:51.810> is<00:04:51.960> really

00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:52.229 
first of all stalker stalk is really

00:04:52.229 --> 00:04:53.960 
first of all stalker stalk is really
nice<00:04:52.440> because<00:04:52.650> it<00:04:52.770> means<00:04:52.979> you<00:04:53.190> can<00:04:53.400> just<00:04:53.550> keep

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:53.970 
nice because it means you can just keep

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:55.610 
nice because it means you can just keep
you<00:04:54.210> know<00:04:54.240> moving<00:04:54.539> around<00:04:54.629> a<00:04:54.930> nice<00:04:55.199> like<00:04:55.440> as

00:04:55.610 --> 00:04:55.620 
you know moving around a nice like as

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:04.440 
into an SMG kind of almost close range

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:06.950 
into an SMG kind of almost close range
of<00:05:04.590> science<00:05:04.860> that's<00:05:05.009> been<00:05:05.099> due<00:05:05.250> to<00:05:05.539> and<00:05:06.539> then

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:06.960 
of science that's been due to and then

00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:08.749 
of science that's been due to and then
maybe<00:05:07.289> a<00:05:07.440> little<00:05:07.530> bit<00:05:07.830> on<00:05:07.979> the<00:05:08.130> go<00:05:08.280> so<00:05:08.550> you<00:05:08.639> can

00:05:08.749 --> 00:05:08.759 
maybe a little bit on the go so you can

00:05:08.759 --> 00:05:10.760 
maybe a little bit on the go so you can
sprint<00:05:09.389> around<00:05:09.569> corners<00:05:09.930> and<00:05:09.960> stuff<00:05:10.229> and<00:05:10.409> do

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:10.770 
sprint around corners and stuff and do

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:12.860 
sprint around corners and stuff and do
that<00:05:10.949> fast<00:05:11.190> stuff<00:05:11.460> and<00:05:11.639> then<00:05:12.210> if<00:05:12.389> you've<00:05:12.840> got

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:12.870 
that fast stuff and then if you've got

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:14.450 
that fast stuff and then if you've got
the<00:05:12.990> points<00:05:13.319> laying<00:05:13.530> around<00:05:13.650> then<00:05:13.979> the<00:05:14.099> Jim<00:05:14.280> T

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:14.460 
the points laying around then the Jim T

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:16.040 
the points laying around then the Jim T
is<00:05:14.639> always<00:05:14.789> a<00:05:14.880> nice<00:05:15.060> one<00:05:15.240> too<00:05:15.419> so<00:05:15.659> then<00:05:15.810> off

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:16.050 
is always a nice one too so then off

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:17.839 
is always a nice one too so then off
you've<00:05:16.289> got<00:05:16.319> those<00:05:16.680> points<00:05:17.099> perks<00:05:17.550> you<00:05:17.699> want

00:05:17.839 --> 00:05:17.849 
you've got those points perks you want

00:05:17.849 --> 00:05:20.300 
you've got those points perks you want
on<00:05:18.020> hardline<00:05:19.020> and<00:05:19.050> paying<00:05:19.740> our<00:05:19.860> another<00:05:20.069> two

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:20.310 
on hardline and paying our another two

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:22.490 
on hardline and paying our another two
that<00:05:20.580> are<00:05:20.699> particularly<00:05:21.330> good<00:05:21.659> then<00:05:22.380> I'd

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:22.500 
that are particularly good then I'd

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:24.379 
that are particularly good then I'd
recommend<00:05:22.650> if<00:05:23.520> you<00:05:23.699> have<00:05:23.819> any<00:05:23.969> points<00:05:24.210> left

00:05:24.379 --> 00:05:24.389 
recommend if you have any points left

00:05:24.389 --> 00:05:26.629 
recommend if you have any points left
and<00:05:24.630> you<00:05:24.870> really<00:05:25.229> want<00:05:25.380> the<00:05:25.500> self<00:05:25.770> off<00:05:26.430> the

00:05:26.629 --> 00:05:26.639 
and you really want the self off the

00:05:26.639 --> 00:05:28.999 
and you really want the self off the
radar<00:05:26.969> on<00:05:27.719> the<00:05:27.930> radar<00:05:28.229> operator<00:05:28.770> whatever

00:05:28.999 --> 00:05:29.009 
radar on the radar operator whatever

00:05:29.009 --> 00:05:30.920 
radar on the radar operator whatever
it's<00:05:29.129> called<00:05:29.280> is<00:05:29.520> a<00:05:29.550> smart<00:05:30.060> one<00:05:30.210> and<00:05:30.389> so<00:05:30.750> is

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:30.930 
it's called is a smart one and so is

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:32.480 
it's called is a smart one and so is
because<00:05:31.590> it<00:05:31.710> pairs<00:05:32.009> really<00:05:32.099> well<00:05:32.280> the

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:32.490 
because it pairs really well the

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:34.459 
because it pairs really well the
silencer<00:05:32.909> not<00:05:33.630> that<00:05:33.810> you<00:05:33.900> really<00:05:33.930> show<00:05:34.289> up<00:05:34.349> in

00:05:34.459 --> 00:05:34.469 
silencer not that you really show up in

silencer not that you really show up in
UAV<00:05:34.740> that<00:05:34.770> much<00:05:34.979> anyway<00:05:35.250> but<00:05:35.490> off<00:05:35.550> the<00:05:35.610> radar

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:35.880 
UAV that much anyway but off the radar

00:05:35.880 --> 00:05:38.809 
UAV that much anyway but off the radar
will<00:05:36.240> just<00:05:36.389> give<00:05:36.539> you<00:05:36.599> that<00:05:36.690> tiny<00:05:36.960> bit<00:05:37.259> off<00:05:37.819> you

00:05:38.809 --> 00:05:38.819 
will just give you that tiny bit off you

00:05:38.819 --> 00:05:40.040 
will just give you that tiny bit off you
know<00:05:38.940> nice<00:05:39.180> I<00:05:39.569> guess

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:40.050 
know nice I guess

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:42.890 
know nice I guess
avoidance<00:05:41.009> and<00:05:41.190> then<00:05:41.759> dead<00:05:42.360> silence<00:05:42.750> will

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:42.900 
avoidance and then dead silence will

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:44.209 
avoidance and then dead silence will
keep<00:05:43.050> you<00:05:43.259> hidden<00:05:43.469> at<00:05:43.620> close<00:05:43.770> range<00:05:44.009> which<00:05:44.190> is

00:05:44.209 --> 00:05:44.219 
keep you hidden at close range which is

00:05:44.219 --> 00:05:45.290 
keep you hidden at close range which is
where<00:05:44.460> you<00:05:44.550> really<00:05:44.819> want<00:05:44.909> to<00:05:45.029> be<00:05:45.090> able<00:05:45.150> is

00:05:45.290 --> 00:05:45.300 
where you really want to be able is

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:47.480 
where you really want to be able is
weapon<00:05:45.630> because<00:05:46.469> I<00:05:46.500> guess<00:05:46.680> close<00:05:46.919> /<00:05:47.219> medium

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:47.490 
weapon because I guess close / medium

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:49.730 
weapon because I guess close / medium
range<00:05:47.849> to<00:05:48.120> pull<00:05:48.240> it<00:05:48.330> more<00:05:48.690> inspect<00:05:49.020> it<00:05:49.169> this

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:49.740 
range to pull it more inspect it this

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:51.499 
range to pull it more inspect it this
weapon<00:05:50.009> is<00:05:50.190> a<00:05:50.219> good<00:05:50.580> assault<00:05:50.849> rifle<00:05:51.180> in<00:05:51.300> there

00:05:51.499 --> 00:05:51.509 
weapon is a good assault rifle in there

00:05:51.509 --> 00:05:54.170 
weapon is a good assault rifle in there
is<00:05:51.719> a<00:05:52.050> SMG<00:05:52.560> kind<00:05:52.979> of<00:05:53.099> built<00:05:53.310> in<00:05:53.550> but<00:05:53.729> not<00:05:53.909> a<00:05:53.940> full

is a SMG kind of built in but not a full
SMG<00:05:54.630> it's<00:05:54.750> confusing<00:05:55.169> to<00:05:55.289> explain<00:05:55.680> as<00:05:55.919> yeah

00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:01.139 
well it's good things so it's really

00:06:01.139 --> 00:06:03.499 
well it's good things so it's really
disgusting<00:06:01.909> different<00:06:02.909> loadout<00:06:03.240> for<00:06:03.419> this

00:06:03.499 --> 00:06:03.509 
disgusting different loadout for this

00:06:03.509 --> 00:06:04.939 
disgusting different loadout for this
weapon<00:06:03.659> because<00:06:03.870> there<00:06:04.259> is<00:06:04.380> a<00:06:04.409> second<00:06:04.830> way<00:06:04.919> to

00:06:04.939 --> 00:06:04.949 
weapon because there is a second way to

00:06:04.949 --> 00:06:06.709 
weapon because there is a second way to
use<00:06:05.190> it<00:06:05.219> that<00:06:05.580> most<00:06:05.909> of<00:06:06.029> us<00:06:06.060> always<00:06:06.330> calm<00:06:06.630> be

00:06:06.709 --> 00:06:06.719 
use it that most of us always calm be

00:06:06.719 --> 00:06:08.450 
use it that most of us always calm be
use<00:06:06.870> basically<00:06:07.650> you've<00:06:07.830> got<00:06:07.860> a<00:06:07.949> burst<00:06:08.190> fire

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:08.460 
use basically you've got a burst fire

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:10.249 
use basically you've got a burst fire
attachment<00:06:08.669> on<00:06:09.000> it<00:06:09.029> as<00:06:09.240> well<00:06:09.509> as<00:06:09.659> potentially

00:06:10.249 --> 00:06:10.259 
attachment on it as well as potentially

00:06:10.259 --> 00:06:11.809 
attachment on it as well as potentially
a<00:06:10.289> red<00:06:10.469> dot<00:06:10.680> for<00:06:10.830> it<00:06:10.919> because<00:06:11.099> red<00:06:11.310> dot<00:06:11.490> seems

00:06:11.809 --> 00:06:11.819 
a red dot for it because red dot seems

00:06:11.819 --> 00:06:13.339 
a red dot for it because red dot seems
to<00:06:11.909> tear<00:06:12.060> well<00:06:12.180> first<00:06:12.449> fire<00:06:12.659> you<00:06:13.229> could

00:06:13.339 --> 00:06:13.349 
to tear well first fire you could

00:06:13.349 --> 00:06:15.140 
to tear well first fire you could
obviously<00:06:13.590> trade<00:06:13.919> that<00:06:14.069> out<00:06:14.250> for<00:06:14.550> something

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:15.150 
obviously trade that out for something

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:16.700 
obviously trade that out for something
like<00:06:15.330> the<00:06:15.479> grip<00:06:15.690> so<00:06:15.930> you<00:06:15.960> get<00:06:16.229> the<00:06:16.349> extra<00:06:16.500> if

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:16.710 
like the grip so you get the extra if

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:18.620 
like the grip so you get the extra if
their<00:06:16.889> aim<00:06:17.069> as<00:06:17.669> she<00:06:17.849> works<00:06:18.029> really<00:06:18.240> well<00:06:18.449> with

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:18.630 
their aim as she works really well with

00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:20.510 
their aim as she works really well with
the<00:06:18.750> burst<00:06:19.229> by<00:06:19.409> it's<00:06:19.560> one<00:06:19.680> of<00:06:19.770> like<00:06:19.919> tourists

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:20.520 
the burst by it's one of like tourists

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:21.980 
the burst by it's one of like tourists
or<00:06:20.610> else<00:06:20.789> I<00:06:20.940> think<00:06:21.000> actually<00:06:21.300> works<00:06:21.569> a<00:06:21.779> burst

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:21.990 
or else I think actually works a burst

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:23.719 
or else I think actually works a burst
where<00:06:22.169> it<00:06:22.770> has<00:06:22.919> a<00:06:22.949> little<00:06:23.219> bit<00:06:23.340> increased

00:06:23.719 --> 00:06:23.729 
where it has a little bit increased

00:06:23.729 --> 00:06:26.390 
where it has a little bit increased
damage<00:06:23.909> as<00:06:24.180> well<00:06:24.300> so<00:06:24.830> my<00:06:25.830> helping<00:06:26.159> up<00:06:26.250> you're
