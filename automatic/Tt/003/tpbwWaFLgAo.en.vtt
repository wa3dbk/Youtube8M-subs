hairdryer for devices like this which
are<00:01:02.190> curved<00:01:02.520> and<00:01:02.789> so<00:01:03.420> I<00:01:03.449> actually<00:01:03.629> did<00:01:03.989> do<00:01:04.140> that

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
are curved and so I actually did do that

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.170 
are curved and so I actually did do that
and<00:01:04.530> as<00:01:04.769> you<00:01:04.830> guys<00:01:04.979> can<00:01:05.129> see<00:01:05.189> here<00:01:05.519> one<00:01:06.030> of<00:01:06.119> the

and as you guys can see here one of the

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:07.550 
and as you guys can see here one of the
good<00:01:06.299> things<00:01:06.450> about<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.780> skin<00:01:07.020> is<00:01:07.170> that<00:01:07.320> it<00:01:07.409> is

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
good things about the skin is that it is

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.560 
good things about the skin is that it is
removable<00:01:08.189> so<00:01:08.340> I<00:01:08.670> actually<00:01:08.970> did<00:01:09.210> have<00:01:09.270> to<00:01:09.420> take

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:09.570 
removable so I actually did have to take

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:12.200 
removable so I actually did have to take
it<00:01:09.720> off<00:01:09.840> quite<00:01:10.080> a<00:01:10.140> number<00:01:10.799> of<00:01:10.890> times<00:01:11.130> but<00:01:12.000> of

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
it off quite a number of times but of

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.240 
it off quite a number of times but of
course<00:01:12.510> after<00:01:12.750> managing<00:01:13.530> to<00:01:13.650> get<00:01:13.770> it<00:01:13.920> lined

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
course after managing to get it lined

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.670 
course after managing to get it lined
properly<00:01:14.790> I<00:01:15.000> did<00:01:15.600> actually<00:01:15.900> use<00:01:16.140> my<00:01:16.320> sister's

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
properly I did actually use my sister's

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.080 
properly I did actually use my sister's
hair<00:01:16.890> dryer<00:01:17.130> which<00:01:17.400> is<00:01:17.520> why<00:01:17.640> you<00:01:17.700> can<00:01:17.880> probably

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:18.090 
hair dryer which is why you can probably

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.060 
hair dryer which is why you can probably
see<00:01:18.420> a<00:01:18.450> pink<00:01:18.780> hair<00:01:18.990> dryer<00:01:19.259> in<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.650> video<00:01:19.860> at

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
see a pink hair dryer in the video at

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.070 
see a pink hair dryer in the video at
some<00:01:20.220> point<00:01:20.520> to<00:01:21.150> actually<00:01:21.450> heat<00:01:21.600> it<00:01:21.720> up<00:01:21.810> to<00:01:21.990> the

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
some point to actually heat it up to the

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:23.539 
some point to actually heat it up to the
point<00:01:22.290> where<00:01:22.439> the<00:01:22.530> vinyl<00:01:22.890> melts<00:01:23.220> just<00:01:23.400> a

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
point where the vinyl melts just a

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:24.980 
point where the vinyl melts just a
little<00:01:23.759> bit<00:01:23.909> and<00:01:24.119> then<00:01:24.450> it<00:01:24.570> conforms

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:24.990 
little bit and then it conforms

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.990 
little bit and then it conforms
perfectly<00:01:25.049> to<00:01:25.619> the<00:01:25.740> device<00:01:25.979> and<00:01:26.549> I<00:01:26.670> think<00:01:26.909> that

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
perfectly to the device and I think that

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.640 
perfectly to the device and I think that
it<00:01:27.119> looks<00:01:27.270> very<00:01:27.360> very<00:01:27.659> nice<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.350> skin

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
it looks very very nice the skin

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:30.980 
it looks very very nice the skin
actually<00:01:28.799> fits<00:01:29.189> just<00:01:29.310> perfectly<00:01:30.119> I<00:01:30.450> actually

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990 
actually fits just perfectly I actually

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.080 
actually fits just perfectly I actually
have<00:01:31.350> it<00:01:31.500> exactly<00:01:32.310> lined<00:01:32.520> up<00:01:32.700> and<00:01:32.850> I<00:01:32.880> think

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
have it exactly lined up and I think

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:34.460 
have it exactly lined up and I think
that<00:01:33.180> this<00:01:33.270> is<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:33.540> best<00:01:33.689> install<00:01:34.079> I've<00:01:34.290> ever

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.470 
that this is the best install I've ever

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.440 
that this is the best install I've ever
done<00:01:34.680> and<00:01:35.280> so<00:01:35.460> without<00:01:35.610> any<00:01:35.729> further<00:01:35.880> ado<00:01:36.150> now

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
done and so without any further ado now

feel<00:02:11.520> good<00:02:11.550> in<00:02:11.819> the<00:02:11.910> hand

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:12.410 
feel good in the hand

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.020 
feel good in the hand
but<00:02:12.770> more<00:02:12.980> often<00:02:13.130> than<00:02:13.400> not<00:02:13.430> it<00:02:13.670> does<00:02:13.790> feel

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
but more often than not it does feel

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:15.910 
but more often than not it does feel
very<00:02:14.060> slippery<00:02:14.720> and<00:02:14.900> I<00:02:15.410> just<00:02:15.590> don't<00:02:15.740> like<00:02:15.860> it

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:15.920 
very slippery and I just don't like it

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:17.860 
very slippery and I just don't like it
and<00:02:16.250> this<00:02:16.700> skin<00:02:16.910> actually<00:02:17.120> adds<00:02:17.450> a<00:02:17.630> really

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:17.870 
and this skin actually adds a really

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.870 
and this skin actually adds a really
nice<00:02:18.050> new<00:02:18.320> texture<00:02:18.650> to<00:02:18.800> the<00:02:18.890> device<00:02:19.160> which

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880 
nice new texture to the device which

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:21.430 
nice new texture to the device which
makes<00:02:20.090> it<00:02:20.180> a<00:02:20.210> lot<00:02:20.360> easier<00:02:20.420> to<00:02:20.810> hold<00:02:21.050> and

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:21.440 
makes it a lot easier to hold and

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.650 
makes it a lot easier to hold and
actually<00:02:21.770> use<00:02:22.190> more<00:02:22.490> on<00:02:22.730> a<00:02:22.760> day-to-day<00:02:23.240> basis

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
actually use more on a day-to-day basis

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:24.940 
actually use more on a day-to-day basis
I've<00:02:23.810> actually<00:02:23.990> found<00:02:24.200> myself<00:02:24.410> using<00:02:24.800> my

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
I've actually found myself using my

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:26.350 
I've actually found myself using my
iPhone<00:02:25.310> a<00:02:25.340> little<00:02:25.610> bit<00:02:25.700> more<00:02:25.850> since<00:02:26.090> the<00:02:26.210> time

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360 
iPhone a little bit more since the time

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:27.790 
iPhone a little bit more since the time
I<00:02:26.480> installed<00:02:26.840> this<00:02:26.990> skin<00:02:27.230> and<00:02:27.440> I<00:02:27.530> really

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:27.800 
I installed this skin and I really

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:29.590 
I installed this skin and I really
really<00:02:27.890> do<00:02:28.100> like<00:02:28.280> it<00:02:28.310> now<00:02:29.120> as<00:02:29.240> you<00:02:29.330> guys<00:02:29.420> can

really do like it now as you guys can

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:30.760 
really do like it now as you guys can
see<00:02:29.720> from<00:02:29.750> these<00:02:29.960> clips<00:02:30.260> that<00:02:30.380> are<00:02:30.530> on<00:02:30.620> screen

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:30.770 
see from these clips that are on screen

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:32.920 
see from these clips that are on screen
right<00:02:31.100> now<00:02:31.280> on<00:02:31.580> the<00:02:31.880> buttons<00:02:32.210> the<00:02:32.510> ports

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
right now on the buttons the ports

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:34.750 
right now on the buttons the ports
everything<00:02:33.350> is<00:02:33.500> cut<00:02:33.710> out<00:02:33.800> just<00:02:34.070> perfectly<00:02:34.460> and

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
everything is cut out just perfectly and

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.490 
everything is cut out just perfectly and
it<00:02:34.850> does<00:02:35.000> not<00:02:35.150> interfere<00:02:35.480> with<00:02:35.750> any<00:02:35.960> of<00:02:36.380> the

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:36.500 
it does not interfere with any of the

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:37.930 
it does not interfere with any of the
accessories<00:02:36.800> or<00:02:37.220> peripherals<00:02:37.670> that<00:02:37.760> you

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:37.940 
accessories or peripherals that you

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:39.910 
accessories or peripherals that you
would<00:02:38.060> like<00:02:38.150> to<00:02:38.300> connect<00:02:38.570> to<00:02:38.720> the<00:02:38.810> device<00:02:38.930> now

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
would like to connect to the device now

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.830 
would like to connect to the device now
this<00:02:40.100> also<00:02:40.280> does<00:02:40.550> work<00:02:40.820> with<00:02:41.030> the<00:02:41.090> majority<00:02:41.390> of

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:41.840 
this also does work with the majority of

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.020 
this also does work with the majority of
cases<00:02:41.990> because<00:02:42.410> it<00:02:42.500> is<00:02:42.620> an<00:02:42.740> ultra<00:02:43.100> slim<00:02:43.310> skin

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
cases because it is an ultra slim skin

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:45.550 
cases because it is an ultra slim skin
so<00:02:44.390> it<00:02:44.480> isn't<00:02:44.810> really<00:02:44.930> gonna<00:02:45.080> protect<00:02:45.410> you

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560 
so it isn't really gonna protect you

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:46.900 
so it isn't really gonna protect you
from<00:02:45.650> any<00:02:45.860> drops<00:02:46.130> or<00:02:46.310> anything<00:02:46.640> but<00:02:46.820> then

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:46.910 
from any drops or anything but then

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.400 
from any drops or anything but then
again<00:02:47.000> that's<00:02:47.330> not<00:02:47.510> what<00:02:47.660> it's<00:02:47.780> meant<00:02:47.990> for

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
again that's not what it's meant for

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.080 
again that's not what it's meant for
it<00:02:48.980> is<00:02:49.130> definitely<00:02:49.520> gonna<00:02:49.610> protect<00:02:49.940> you

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
it is definitely gonna protect you

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:51.640 
it is definitely gonna protect you
against<00:02:50.330> scratches<00:02:50.780> and<00:02:50.960> if<00:02:51.110> you're<00:02:51.230> like<00:02:51.410> me

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:51.650 
against scratches and if you're like me

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:52.750 
against scratches and if you're like me
I<00:02:51.680> actually<00:02:52.100> have<00:02:52.220> a<00:02:52.250> screen<00:02:52.700> protector

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:55.640 
underneath the front skin because the

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:12.020 
can see here again I was I was saying

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:14.170 
can see here again I was I was saying
before<00:03:12.320> the<00:03:12.950> texture<00:03:13.430> the<00:03:13.700> feeling<00:03:14.030> of<00:03:14.120> the

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:14.180 
before the texture the feeling of the

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:15.460 
before the texture the feeling of the
phone<00:03:14.360> altogether<00:03:14.870> it<00:03:15.020> does<00:03:15.200> feel<00:03:15.440> really

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
phone altogether it does feel really

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:18.130 
phone altogether it does feel really
really<00:03:15.950> nice<00:03:16.130> and<00:03:16.370> also<00:03:17.000> not<00:03:17.600> just<00:03:17.780> visually

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:18.140 
really nice and also not just visually

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:19.750 
really nice and also not just visually
but<00:03:18.290> also<00:03:18.500> aesthetically<00:03:19.100> I<00:03:19.220> think<00:03:19.520> that<00:03:19.670> the

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
but also aesthetically I think that the

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.100 
but also aesthetically I think that the
skin<00:03:19.970> really<00:03:20.090> does<00:03:20.330> add<00:03:20.450> a<00:03:20.570> touch<00:03:20.840> of<00:03:20.990> style

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.110 
skin really does add a touch of style

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:23.440 
skin really does add a touch of style
and<00:03:21.890> increased<00:03:22.280> functionality<00:03:22.880> in<00:03:23.090> terms<00:03:23.330> of

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
and increased functionality in terms of

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:24.850 
and increased functionality in terms of
actually<00:03:23.720> gripping<00:03:24.020> the<00:03:24.140> phone<00:03:24.320> altogether

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:24.860 
actually gripping the phone altogether

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:27.070 
actually gripping the phone altogether
now<00:03:25.550> overall<00:03:25.820> I<00:03:25.940> really<00:03:26.240> really<00:03:26.570> do<00:03:26.720> like<00:03:26.930> the
