mother but they just they seem to have a

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:58.969 
mother but they just they seem to have a
really<00:01:57.840> good<00:01:58.020> functioning<00:01:58.860> relationship

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
really good functioning relationship

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.420 
really good functioning relationship
which<00:01:59.820> is<00:02:00.000> really<00:02:00.240> nice<00:02:00.479> to<00:02:00.750> see<00:02:01.430> functioning

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
which is really nice to see functioning

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.609 
which is really nice to see functioning
relationships<00:02:03.270> happen<00:02:03.509> in<00:02:03.810> real<00:02:03.990> life<00:02:04.049> but

00:02:04.609 --> 00:02:04.619 
relationships happen in real life but

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:07.069 
relationships happen in real life but
they<00:02:05.100> don't<00:02:05.369> make<00:02:05.759> good<00:02:05.969> fiction<00:02:06.420> fodder<00:02:06.930> for

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:07.079 
they don't make good fiction fodder for

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:09.169 
they don't make good fiction fodder for
the<00:02:07.380> most<00:02:07.590> part<00:02:07.860> so<00:02:08.310> they<00:02:08.489> don't<00:02:08.670> always<00:02:08.970> get

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
the most part so they don't always get

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:11.029 
the most part so they don't always get
portrayed<00:02:09.599> and<00:02:09.840> it's<00:02:09.959> nice<00:02:10.170> to<00:02:10.379> see<00:02:10.560> it<00:02:10.649> here

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.039 
portrayed and it's nice to see it here

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:13.370 
portrayed and it's nice to see it here
especially<00:02:11.700> in<00:02:12.150> a<00:02:12.239> story<00:02:12.510> that

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
especially in a story that

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:16.040 
especially in a story that
is<00:02:13.440> ultimately<00:02:14.010> meant<00:02:14.400> to<00:02:14.670> be<00:02:14.910> a<00:02:14.940> dark<00:02:15.600> story

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:16.050 
is ultimately meant to be a dark story

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:19.460 
is ultimately meant to be a dark story
that<00:02:16.710> we<00:02:16.830> have<00:02:17.100> this<00:02:17.550> this<00:02:18.330> patch<00:02:18.660> of<00:02:19.050> just

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:25.680 
really that's just that's where the book

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.830 
really that's just that's where the book
is<00:02:25.830> right<00:02:26.220> now<00:02:26.430> it<00:02:26.640> shows<00:02:26.850> us<00:02:27.090> the<00:02:27.270> dark<00:02:27.540> it

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
is right now it shows us the dark it

shows us some gory and everything but we

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:34.310 
shows us some gory and everything but we
just<00:02:31.440> don't<00:02:32.150> we<00:02:33.150> have<00:02:33.360> like<00:02:33.900> I<00:02:34.020> said<00:02:34.200> the

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:34.320 
just don't we have like I said the

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:36.170 
just don't we have like I said the
context<00:02:34.890> for<00:02:34.950> how<00:02:35.070> they<00:02:35.310> came<00:02:35.520> to<00:02:35.580> be<00:02:35.760> here

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
context for how they came to be here

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.830 
context for how they came to be here
which<00:02:36.300> is<00:02:36.510> its<00:02:36.930> own<00:02:37.140> dark<00:02:37.530> story<00:02:37.860> but<00:02:38.820> we<00:02:39.630> don't

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
which is its own dark story but we don't

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.110 
which is its own dark story but we don't
know<00:02:40.230> a<00:02:40.620> whole<00:02:40.950> lot<00:02:41.010> about<00:02:41.280> what's<00:02:41.700> going<00:02:41.880> on

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
know a whole lot about what's going on

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.390 
know a whole lot about what's going on
in<00:02:42.300> those<00:02:42.420> woods<00:02:42.750> we<00:02:43.140> just<00:02:43.680> don't<00:02:43.950> have<00:02:44.220> a<00:02:44.250> lot

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400 
in those woods we just don't have a lot

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.420 
in those woods we just don't have a lot
of<00:02:44.580> context<00:02:45.390> yet<00:02:45.660> and<00:02:45.960> I'm<00:02:46.020> very<00:02:46.800> curious<00:02:47.190> to

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
of context yet and I'm very curious to

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.880 
of context yet and I'm very curious to
see<00:02:47.730> how<00:02:47.940> he<00:02:48.540> meant<00:02:48.780> at<00:02:49.020> how<00:02:49.230> Scott<00:02:49.560> Snyder

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:49.890 
see how he meant at how Scott Snyder

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.060 
see how he meant at how Scott Snyder
builds<00:02:50.430> that<00:02:50.640> and<00:02:50.910> how<00:02:51.060> jog<00:02:51.740> continues<00:02:52.740> to

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
builds that and how jog continues to

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:54.860 
builds that and how jog continues to
illustrate<00:02:53.850> that<00:02:53.880> because<00:02:54.510> I<00:02:54.540> think<00:02:54.720> that

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:54.870 
illustrate that because I think that

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:56.630 
illustrate that because I think that
they're<00:02:55.140> working<00:02:55.290> very<00:02:55.740> well<00:02:55.860> together<00:02:56.280> in

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:56.640 
they're working very well together in

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.370 
they're working very well together in
this<00:02:56.850> book<00:02:57.890> something<00:02:58.910> that<00:02:59.910> I<00:03:00.300> also<00:03:00.660> liked

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
this book something that I also liked

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.250 
this book something that I also liked
about<00:03:01.590> the<00:03:01.920> story<00:03:02.280> is<00:03:02.640> it's<00:03:03.600> actually<00:03:03.780> not<00:03:04.110> the

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
about the story is it's actually not the

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.850 
about the story is it's actually not the
comic<00:03:04.590> book<00:03:04.770> itself<00:03:05.070> at<00:03:06.060> the<00:03:06.330> end<00:03:06.570> of<00:03:07.140> comic

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
comic book itself at the end of comic

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.040 
comic book itself at the end of comic
books<00:03:08.100> these<00:03:08.310> days<00:03:08.370> a<00:03:09.090> lot<00:03:09.180> of<00:03:09.600> writers<00:03:09.780> are

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:10.050 
books these days a lot of writers are

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:11.660 
books these days a lot of writers are
getting<00:03:10.260> back<00:03:10.440> to<00:03:10.650> letters<00:03:10.950> comes<00:03:11.250> obviously

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:13.740 
they miss them in their own readings so

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:15.770 
they miss them in their own readings so
they're<00:03:13.860> trying<00:03:14.100> to<00:03:14.160> bring<00:03:14.370> it<00:03:14.400> back<00:03:14.520> and<00:03:15.060> in

not<00:04:26.560> really<00:04:27.520> clearly<00:04:27.729> to<00:04:27.939> find<00:04:28.150> at<00:04:28.300> this<00:04:28.449> point

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810 
not really clearly to find at this point

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:32.279 
not really clearly to find at this point
I<00:04:29.080> do<00:04:29.530> think<00:04:29.949> it's<00:04:30.069> got<00:04:30.219> a<00:04:30.249> good<00:04:30.789> book<00:04:31.180> I<00:04:31.449> think

00:04:32.279 --> 00:04:32.289 
I do think it's got a good book I think

00:04:32.289 --> 00:04:35.070 
I do think it's got a good book I think
that<00:04:32.560> if<00:04:32.740> you're<00:04:33.310> on<00:04:33.550> the<00:04:33.610> fence<00:04:34.270> about<00:04:34.689> it

00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:35.080 
that if you're on the fence about it

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:39.269 
that if you're on the fence about it
maybe<00:04:36.389> wait<00:04:37.389> a<00:04:37.419> little<00:04:37.689> bit<00:04:37.960> get<00:04:38.289> the<00:04:38.349> trade

00:04:39.269 --> 00:04:39.279 
maybe wait a little bit get the trade

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:41.519 
maybe wait a little bit get the trade
paperback<00:04:39.789> when<00:04:39.969> that<00:04:40.090> comes<00:04:40.300> out<00:04:40.629> and<00:04:40.840> half<00:04:41.409> a

00:04:41.529 --> 00:04:43.350 
paperback when that comes out and half a
year<00:04:41.860> because<00:04:42.430> that'll<00:04:42.909> have<00:04:43.029> a<00:04:43.060> few<00:04:43.330> issues

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:43.360 
year because that'll have a few issues

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.570 
year because that'll have a few issues
in<00:04:43.810> one<00:04:44.110> in<00:04:44.349> those<00:04:44.560> points<00:04:45.129> that<00:04:45.279> aren't

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:45.580
