00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:12.130
 The new xf car that's here today is a premium luxury grade aero 

00:00:07.959 --> 00:00:16.869
 It is a car with a package option called Dynamic Pack . 

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:18.530
 First I made a minor change and what changed most 

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:23.780
 It is a face 

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:28.940
 Conventional type 9 headlights are slightly rounded on the hood side 

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:33.950
 But it had become a raised shape is clean this time 

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:38.540
 Of the entire lamp modeling is Kirenaga looks the same image as the xj 

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:44.200
 In here the lamp of the LED marker entered 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:49.540
 Grill First, the entire grille of mesh was a little upright 

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:50.470
 In this car at the same time is with a package option that aerodynamic pack 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:53.680
 By 

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:58.640
 The entire grill is blacked out 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:01:01.400
 The bumper form is also its package option 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:07.130
 To a dedicated design 

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:11.220
 The blade of the chrome enters here, but the blur around the glaring 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:15.300
 You are chrome and then the blade 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:19.400
 Then decorated with chrome in the headlights 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:22.680
 By arranging the light things effectively 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:25.600
 While being very energetic 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:31.400
 Impressive look 

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:34.760
 But but we have been around to the side that has been and tables 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:37.060
 The report is a coupe- style proportion 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:40.020
 While being a sedan 

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:44.050
 With a very arched roofline 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:46.010
 Simply put, very stylish proportions are stylish 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:50.570
 then 

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:53.600
 This side window's chrome in the sense of highlighting its arched 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:02:00.049
 The graphics are very effective 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:02:01.610
 Then the tire wheel is also 20 inches, but its foot is very trapezoidal 20 inches 

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:07.150
 Since the tire oil 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:07.150
 This is a very stylish image even more prominent 

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:18.110
 It is a rare view, but I think that the impression is different at first glance 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:21.440
 Is it is here of the tail lamp 

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.730
 It spread to the trunk lid side 

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:29.269
 then 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:35.540
 The fact is that the lamps that light up here use all of the LED technology. 

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:37.280
 The graphic when stepping on the brake lamp is very distinctive 

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:42.720
 I have a new feeling 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:44.800
 The blinker is also very sharp because it uses leb 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.670
 This is also new 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.630
 I have been directing 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:52.040
 garnish of chrome 

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:55.340
 E was also spread to the very 

00:02:52.040 --> 00:03:01.250
 This is also a big identification point even transparent 

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:08.330
 In this car, a lip- like spoiler is attached to the rear end of that trunk lid. 

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:14.780
 This will be part of the aerodynamic pack option 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:15.770
 Let me tell you a little selfish now and take the river now at your favorite angle 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:20.490
 is 

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:25.860
 This Ford is a coupe sedan while in the country Peru 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:28.470
 The flowing roof line and then this is an option but 21 more 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:29.850
 Very powerful tire wheel 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:35.720
 then 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:37.230
 It is my face that featured a new long-length headlight 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:40.240
 Rin here 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:46.380
 Is most fortunate 

00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:46.380
 I 'm currently taking this cut for an angle that looks symbolically
