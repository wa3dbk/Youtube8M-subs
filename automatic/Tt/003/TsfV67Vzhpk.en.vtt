 Brother Jared, what happened? Reiter told the songs to him what's going on 

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:12.270
 yourself 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.140
 now did 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.329
 No what they needed Round Eternity 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:27.740
 the league 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:29.169
 what have you done 

00:00:29.169 --> 00:00:32.339
 what if not learned in the main markets of our people 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:37.069
 in the 4th 

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:40.069

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:50.250
 she defends her 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:51.240
 No 

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:54.240
 we need this power the citizens know too 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:56.050
 my brother 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:59.470
 how power of the well was when lured to the legionnaires 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:03.270
 and through your guilt there is a reason for their return 8 

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.240
 my fault 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.630
 May study this fountain is not a curse 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.640
 but a gift from Aden Jews or anyone else 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:23.320
 Our people are above all Mayer 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.680
 only to ourselves leave the guest 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.190
 which is just as unexpected 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:31.820
 not only mischief and annihilation would be insanity 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.150
 and a crime against us all 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:35.380
 in songs 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:38.750
 I see all my attempts to appeal to your mind in the wind 

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:39.530
 spoken 

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.150
 we can not tolerate such a danger to this world the well needs 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:44.360
 be destroyed 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.259
 whether with or without his consent 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.440
 the inlet and see it 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:51.440
 therefore come 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:55.320
 the revenue is flowing 

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.320
 Landshut 

00:02:12.969 --> 00:02:14.779
 that is hopeless 

00:02:14.779 --> 00:02:18.339
 I see no way the chaotic currents that this water 

00:02:18.339 --> 00:02:19.709
 lead to break 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:22.309
 this fountain is not heard 

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:24.379
 set your address 

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:26.619
 Yes and

00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:34.629
 the pensioner 

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:35.869
 now we will 

00:02:35.869 --> 00:02:38.629
 big issues

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:54.489
 who go their own way only this fountain de Gaulle's em titles 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:59.149
 enough 

00:02:59.149 --> 00:03:02.409
 from this summer 

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:03.869
 you want 

00:03:03.869 --> 00:03:08.709
 in safer the villas 

00:03:12.669 --> 00:03:13.600
 Wehrle 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.600
 No 

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:29.309
 and not just the double bogey as you call the baseless one 

00:03:29.309 --> 00:03:33.999
 bring your people to be my blessing of immortality and Benedict to the 

00:03:33.999 --> 00:03:38.599
 Weltenbaum hopes that he will be developed for all time and by everyone 

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:39.569
 may 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:42.569
 These are enough for a good or a bad awakening 

00:03:59.819 --> 00:04:01.999
 I came to the decision 

00:04:01.999 --> 00:04:03.839
 Elegance Dommitzsch 

00:04:03.839 --> 00:04:08.149
 for your madness to endanger our people and all of Caliendo 

00:04:08.149 --> 00:04:11.149
 I judge you to be a lifelong dungeon 

00:04:11.929 --> 00:04:15.519
 since the blessing from Doremus has given us eternal life, this means 

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:18.309
 that for all eternity 

00:04:18.309 --> 00:04:22.149
 the Pamina will be in a cell deep under this mountain 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:26.030
 I give hope that some love the words of the right thumb 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:30.209
 Over the centuries, Bahrain has also been sick of market greed 

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.740
 eat value 

00:04:39.939 --> 00:04:41.659
 Schorndorf Ladies World 

00:04:41.659 --> 00:04:44.659
 Werth with years 

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:51.129
 if the traitor is to be elegantly sentenced to eternal captivity 

00:04:51.129 --> 00:04:55.099
 so I ask you do not burden those who are in chains too 

00:04:55.099 --> 00:04:59.580
 one of his cell will keep watch so he gets his deserved punishment 

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:01.509
 not escape 

00:05:01.509 --> 00:05:03.219
 new CEO of the US Open 

00:05:03.219 --> 00:05:06.219
 Bodenbender now asks 

00:05:10.189 --> 00:05:11.749
 yes Landau 

00:05:11.749 --> 00:05:15.279
 good if that is your own wish to break up a new CEO 

00:05:15.279 --> 00:05:16.930
 I agree with that 

00:05:16.930 --> 00:05:18.169
 and thoughts 

00:05:18.169 --> 00:05:20.339
 that they put that load on 

00:05:20.339 --> 00:05:21.619
 That's how it should be
