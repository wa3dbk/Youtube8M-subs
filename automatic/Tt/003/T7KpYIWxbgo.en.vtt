00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:15.240
 hello franck magna we are so 

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:15.240
 in the west of lyon 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:22.050
 2 the lion in the department of the rhône 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:25.430
 with the company m roofing on a 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.630
 construction site so renovation of roofs 

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:29.430
 franck is what you can we 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.910
 tell why you advocated this 

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:35.640
 solution to your teen of ben clients at 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.710
 level of the place mostly it's through 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.250
 compared to a normal car 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.629
 in fact there is a gain of place on mail 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:46.350
 natural insulators 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:49.769
 linen between chevron and a vapor barrier 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.390
 which goes from soul and chevron so unrolled 

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:53.850
 on the length on the flat blow sure the 

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:56.129
 paneling and stapled on the sides for 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.449
 to be well airtight after we come 

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:03.739
 put it this only a natural insulator 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:07.369
 between chevron and after we unfurl 

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:10.590
 the tecpro insulation you see here 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:14.909
 and who with his multi layers that makes 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:17.640
 reflectors that is unrolled on a 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.890
 continuous support an evolution 2 of 15 cm 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:23.250
 to leave a sufficient air gap of 

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.720
 about 4 cm close a blade of air 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.420
 firm they made a blade of air so 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:30.120
 unventilated between the val matte in 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.590
 plant insulation she tecpro this is it 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:34.710
 for that we have a withdrawal in convoy 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:37.409
 van nath did it 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:39.210
 butcher how much of 2 cm 2 cm and 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:42.420
 there we have shaped panels of the 200 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:45.750
 mm in nature insulation in thickness and 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:47.399
 in width so 48 cm and our hot 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.170
 herringbone are 

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:52.090
 dax in axis every five years okay 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.460
 like that there's no cutout have no 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:56.170
 higher cuts 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:59.469
 and as we can see their axis 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:02.619
 intermission and 43 cm and the panel of 

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:04.600
 48 cm so that really stands well there 

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:05.799
 there is no a good thermal at the level 

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.659
 chevrons on the right and on the left 

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:08.950
 yes because he's tight on the 

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:10.119
 chevrons from right to left 

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:11.650
 yes there is a lot of spring so 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:12.849
 illegal well to non-cadres well to 

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:15.400
 herringbone can be seen there during the 

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:16.870
 put in exactly where the panel is 

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.380
 wedge perfectly between the rafters 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:21.220
 without breaking an insulation support so 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.090
 these two isolation techniques 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:26.489
 different 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:30.000
 yes it was worth the linen insulation 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:33.970
 Natural comes in addition to the tech pro 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:39.400
 and it's an insulation complex that 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:40.989
 them really what gpu kate pee wee who 

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.700
 means great energy performance 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:46.630
 and acoustic veil and that cumulates so 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:48.280
 the inertia duval nat- roland vegetable and 

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:49.630
 the reflective multilayer from above 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.519
 which serves as a screen of under roof in 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:54.040
 same time here and that also works 

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:55.269
 on the radiation of the cover so 

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.560
 the earth is when you are there 

00:02:55.269 --> 00:02:58.000
 we see that the roof is not inflated 

00:02:56.560 --> 00:03:01.810
 no there is no safe place and peace sisters 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.940
 not at all and the tpr to the guards 

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:06.250
 are inflated in fact compared to the 

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:08.260
 baule he's the friend of the roads agree 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.250
 underneath and learns one leads against 

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:12.010
 awaits 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:13.570
 in forty forty by tullow tullow and 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.730
 the clashes that hangs on the 

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:19.060
 tile and there you have an insulation that 

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:21.780
 is perfectly waterproof and there you 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:23.740
 do you realize how many 

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.130
 year-building like this of this 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:27.340
 way 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:29.190
 baa about 2000 m² 2000 square meters 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:33.340
 there for example in this subdivision 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:34.840
 today well we did 3 yes the 

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:38.320
 house that is there and the house that is 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:43.690
 there and customers are becoming 

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:45.070
 more about insulation and then yielded a 

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:47.410
 solution that you advocate now 

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:49.810
 moreover each time an insulating chain 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:51.340
 actually mount finds to replace the 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:53.650
 layers of paint and will come in 

00:03:51.340 --> 00:03:58.410
 additional insulation 

00:03:53.650 --> 00:04:03.040
 if we put the tec pro or with the valtech 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:04.570
 complete insulation and the renovation of 

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.830
 once there is already a glass wool 

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:08.709
 for example existing which was enough 

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:09.250
 running so in this case there too she 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:11.230
 is in good condition 

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:13.390
 on a good condition we let it the 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:16.600
 let's create an air gap between 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:16.959
 between our tétreault products and wool 

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:18.609
 of glass 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:22.090
 it is important not that they are in 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:25.210
 contact and I left a check 

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:25.780
 missed all agree and the same in the 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:26.919
 same principle 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:28.479
 instead of putting a screen in fact one 

00:04:26.919 --> 00:04:30.370
 puts in an improvement of relations 

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:34.660
 with the tempo yeah that's it 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:36.250
 the agreement that remains a super insulation 

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:38.290
 because we come in continuous support 

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:40.360
 so we hold a thermal bridge or that 

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:42.790
 with that makes the hat on the on the 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:44.800
 home and how many years it's been 

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:47.620
 that you are in these times so at 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:49.390
 reason of 2000 square meters per year of which 

00:04:47.620 --> 00:04:50.890
 about you have already asked about 

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:56.680
 fourteen thousand square meters of this 

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:58.570
 way there although good at the level of 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:01.960
 rotois so with improvements 

00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:03.580
 summer comfort energy saving 

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:05.919
 also a ford was of course because 

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:08.500
 the interest of these products there is you 

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:10.090
 have attic arranged and ben loses 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:11.050
 no place it's all about the 

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:14.530
 blanket 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:15.099
 you study plates all and we have a 

00:05:14.530 --> 00:05:18.460
 insulation 

00:05:15.099 --> 00:05:22.180
 it's really a pleasure at the level of 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:23.289
 teas a high level of summer and then 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:24.729
 to see as posers too 

00:05:23.289 --> 00:05:27.009
 it's a product that goes is a product 

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:28.930
 already that is natural so no mask 

00:05:27.009 --> 00:05:30.490
 because if we put wool 

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:32.319
 glass and touba a mask because with 

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:35.080
 the fibers all the glass fibers and 

00:05:32.319 --> 00:05:38.349
 where there are people who are allergic 

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:40.360
 especially so me my product 

00:05:38.349 --> 00:05:42.810
 my sale is especially at the level of 

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:46.469
 natural product than those developed 

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:46.469
 without natural products 

00:06:01.129 --> 00:06:05.370
 diab listened to thank you for these 

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:07.969
 information then good luck 

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:07.969
 thank you
