00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:14.549
 hello you look at two pieces of 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.830
 culture the monthly chronicle voice 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:19.170
 of general knowledge the record of this 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.240
 months the guns we go mostly 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.439
 talk about small arms then already 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.630
 how does a gun work 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:26.519
 let's first look at a munition then we 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.570
 has a socket also called holster 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:29.429
 for small calibres 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:31.349
 it is the element that solidarises 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.910
 all the components of the ball she is 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.450
 often conscious in brass or in 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.950
 plastic 

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.170
 the socket itself is hollow 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:39.149
 the front is called the collar and that's where 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.820
 are placed the logical ogive this is the 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.540
 projectile is expelled from the barrel at 

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.190
 middle of the socket 

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.870
 there is the body that contains the 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:48.090
 powder is a propelling charge 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:50.280
 denial stalks most often at the back 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:52.620
 is the base that houses death this 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.120
 often femina of mercury or 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.680
 the azide of shots that have the 

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:57.480
 particularity of producing a small 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.680
 explosion if they suffer a shock 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.109
 violent or friction 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.390
 so death will be ignited the charges 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:05.549
 propulsive that goes on when it burns 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.290
 project our buses out of the socket and 

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:10.350
 Now let's look at an army his 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.030
 components the chassis is 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.939
 the body of tears that holds the barrel 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:17.220
 the lock and the butt the gun is a 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.780
 particularly resistant tube because the 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.549
 temperature inside during the 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.890
 propulsion can rise to more than 2000 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:25.080
 degrees celsius inside the barrel and 

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.369
 grooved which allows to confer to the 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.380
 ball expel a rotational movement 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:30.930
 on itself which improves its 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.610
 aerodynamic stability by decreasing the 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:33.900
 wind deflection these grooves you 

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.640
 reminds can be something 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.990
 oh yes that's what we see in the 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.549
 James Bond movies introductions 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.049
 giving the impression that the camera that 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:42.479
 film is inside a cannon 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:44.729
 the room is the element of the barrel 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.530
 contains the munition the called lock 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.570
 also breech is the room located at 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.950
 the back of the barrel containing the pieces 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.259
 the mechanism of tears 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.759
 the trigger by digital pressure she 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.979
 transmits a mechanism movement of 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.899
 percussion in some cases the relaxation 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.469
 maybe an electric switch the 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:00.149
 trigger 

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:02.579
 it's the part that holds and relax 

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:04.320
 directly the latch or the striker the 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:06.659
 dog is a little hammer that goes 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.580
 hit the firing pin the firing pin gets 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:09.959
 find in the will see he'll hit the 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:10.450
 death that of the cartridge starting the 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.239
 propels 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:14.590
 of the warhead the stick is the handle that 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:16.480
 also serves as compartments where is 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:17.440
 inserted the ammo loaders so 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.120
 that's the technique 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.410
 in practice you have to know that the 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:22.450
 speed of balls and variables between 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.280
 300 and 2000 meters per second 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:25.870
 I recall that the speed of sound and 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.030
 340 meters per second 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:29.860
 the noise generated when firing comes so 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.480
 from two sources on the one hand the speed 

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.950
 balls that when she passes the wall 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.959
 sound and put a detonation 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:36.310
 subsonic balls are therefore less 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:38.170
 noisy but there is also noise 

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.239
 produced by the detonation of gas in the 

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.680
 cannon this town it can be mitigated 

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:43.720
 by adding a silent on tears 

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.980
 but the muffler does not have any actions on 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:45.220
 the noise produced by the speed of the 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:46.900
 ball 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.760
 so contrary to what we can 

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.500
 see in some movies if we use 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.150
 a muffler on a rifle that use 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.980
 bullets then more than 340 meters 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:56.440
 second shot will still produce a 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.760
 detonation in practice always he 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:59.349
 must know that the trajectory of a 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.099
 ball is never linear but 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:01.450
 parabolic 

00:03:00.099 --> 00:03:02.980
 this phenomenon is particularly 

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.780
 important to take into account for 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.400
 long-range shots over the 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.750
 direction and the force of the wind changes 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:09.430
 easily the trajectory of the balls 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:10.810
 the practical scope of firearms is 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.150
 also variable depending on the 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:15.459
 ammunition used a gun will have a 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.810
 maximum range of 50 meters for the 

00:03:15.459 --> 00:03:19.090
 gun can it go 

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:20.650
 up to 100 m an assault rifle 200 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.049
 meters and guns with glasses approximately 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:25.900
 1 km or more the current record of 

00:03:23.049 --> 00:03:28.329
 long hours of shooting being 2475 m 

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.760
 made by British corporal Craig 

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:32.590
 and harrison in 2009 during the war in 

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:34.299
 afghanistan flatly see quickly 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:35.859
 some fairly common weapon models 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:37.150
 story that you can them 

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:39.010
 identify if you ever see them 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:41.470
 somewhere start with the weapons 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:43.750
 punch the revolver which often 

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:45.600
 a capacity of these ammunition then by 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.750
 example we have the python colt presented in 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.430
 1955 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:51.549
 probably one of the most revolvers 

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:52.569
 known the smith &amp; wesson model 29 his 

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:55.440
 tears of clint eastwood in 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:56.560
 the inspector harry the model remington 

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.030
 1858 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:00.430
 it is a model that we find 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:02.230
 frequently in the shooting ranges and 

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:04.030
 still for example the torus trending 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:05.739
 purse and a very brazilian revolver 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:08.560
 imposing intended to draw caliber 

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:11.940
 powerful let's go pistol the beretta 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:14.500
 92 Italian pistol presented in 1976 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:15.850
 using ammunition 9 mm parabellum 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:18.280
 and a charger of a 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:19.600
 the city of 16 min sion he equipped with 

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:21.820
 many armies like the army 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:23.470
 American where the French army whose 

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:24.940
 especially the gendarmerie there are 

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:27.190
 modified versions of this model as the 

00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:29.320
 pam as g1 used by the French army 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:31.000
 and some gendarmerie units on 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:32.890
 sixer sp 2022 

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:35.230
 since 2002 he gradually replaces 

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:37.090
 the guns of the French army his 

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:39.850
 minimum service life is 20 years hence 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:41.320
 its name 2022 indicating that the 

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:44.890
 it can be replaced from 

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:47.260
 2022 the colt m1911 was the gun of the 

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:49.060
 United States Armed Forces between 1911 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:50.680
 and 1987 

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:53.890
 block 17 and manufactured in austria 

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:55.660
 since 1981 equipped with a charger of 17 

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:57.730
 ammunition it has the particularity of having 

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:59.770
 a plastic chassis which makes it 

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:01.450
 very light nevertheless it remains identifiable 

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:03.190
 by metal detectors because the 

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:05.470
 gun the breech and ammunition remains 

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:08.560
 metallic the fn five cevennes use 

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:10.030
 specific ammunition of 5.7 mm this is 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:10.960
 a weapon used by cartels 

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:12.550
 Mexican 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:15.340
 let's go to the gun 

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:17.070
 commonly called submachine gun the mp5 

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:20.740
 German submachine gun developed in 

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:23.770
 1964 the fnp 90 was designed in belgium 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:25.540
 in 1986 he has the distinction of having a 

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:27.100
 loader of 50 ammunition then 

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:28.810
 that they usually have 30 

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:31.060
 he uses the same specific bullets 

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:34.840
 that the fn five seven the uzi eye was 

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:36.940
 invented in 1952 in israel the mc 10 or m 

00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:38.740
 10 you have to know that match om it's 

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:40.300
 like this comes from the name of a factory that 

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:41.920
 manufactures these weapons in the united states we have 

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:43.900
 now the rifles then for the 

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:46.450
 assault rifles there are the famous colts 

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:48.850
 m16 this is the standard assault rifle of 

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:50.380
 the american army the famas and a rifle 

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:51.490
 French assault teaming the army 

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:55.870
 French 

00:05:51.490 --> 00:05:57.940
 the kalachnikov ak47 designed in 1947 in 

00:05:55.870 --> 00:05:59.650
 Soviet Union are low costs of 

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:01.360
 manufacturing and its reliability make it a 

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:03.670
 very popular weapon with guerrillas 

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:06.430
 the kalachnikov ak m is a declination 

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:07.930
 of the a47 which presents the advantage of 

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:08.530
 further reduce the costs of 

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:10.330
 manufacturing 

00:06:08.530 --> 00:06:12.400
 today the cream and the model of 

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:15.040
 kalachnikov the most used for 

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:16.240
 sniper rifles mention the 24th 

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:17.949
 it is the gun 

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:19.539
 precision most used by the army of 

00:06:17.949 --> 00:06:21.400
 American earth he has a scope 

00:06:19.539 --> 00:06:24.520
 practice of 800 meters and a charger of 

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:25.870
 five cartridges the remington 700 the 

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:27.130
 United States Marine Corps 

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:30.819
 use a modified version of this 

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:33.370
 weapon called m40 the pgm and cat 2 is a 

00:06:30.819 --> 00:06:34.210
 French sniper rifle used by 

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:36.340
 the French army 

00:06:34.210 --> 00:06:38.919
 he has a capacity of this cartridge and 

00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:40.900
 a practical range of 1800 meters 

00:06:38.919 --> 00:06:41.680
 f2 is produced in France is used by 

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:43.660
 the French army 

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:47.139
 its range of 800 m is less than 

00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:49.150
 that of the pgm and cat of plus hk psg 1 is 

00:06:47.139 --> 00:06:50.620
 designed in germany it has a cadence of
