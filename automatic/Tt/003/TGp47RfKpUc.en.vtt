 [Music] 

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:13.110
 Hi, I'm the editor of the soul 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:16.099
 welcome to the new break oval the echo 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.419
 by today let's see we have a wheel 

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:21.170
 who has ideas for we have put the 

00:00:18.419 --> 00:00:24.650
 new pills we turn 

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:27.200
 and I do not know if you hear it rubs a p in the 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:29.450
 it rotates very well but it rubs quite a 

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.520
 tidy or quite as we want to call the 

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:33.500
 disk 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:37.240
 if we stay totally silent 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:39.530
 you hear how the disc rubs the pills 

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:41.060
 the most common will be can reach 

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:42.830
 be that the pistons are dirty and that 

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:45.320
 do not return to your site but the most common 

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:48.559
 is to center the clamp that is with these two 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:50.930
 screws that we have here with a key 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:52.610
 someone of 5 will be worth what 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:55.250
 we try to do if we already see that 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:56.840
 centering does not continue to touch us anymore it would be 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:59.210
 issue of cleaning the pistons but 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:01.010
 let's try it with the key there to 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.680
 see the two screws that we have to 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:05.570
 touch to center the clip is this and 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:08.660
 I'm here with a key beyond 5 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:10.910
 it's worth to us then we have I do not know if it 

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:13.399
 appreciate here there are inside we have the 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:15.410
 pills and the disc and there is very little 

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:18.740
 separation between all we will have to see 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:20.479
 a thread of light somewhere and by the 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.510
 On the other hand, see what you're playing, let's see 

00:01:20.479 --> 00:01:25.880
 where is the thread of light 

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:28.030
 and where we're not going to let go first 

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:31.170
 the screw above 

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.170
 now if it's worth 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.890
 and we play with the clamp a bit the 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:41.440
 we move like this with the hand is not if it 

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:41.440
 move let's see and turn the wheel 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.820
 we already see that it almost does not touch you have to look 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.520
 the place where it does not rub to see where it is 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.770
 the thread of light 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.859
 in this case I have to wear the clamp 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:57.049
 to you what you can see in the 

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:59.439
 light at home because here is the 

00:01:57.049 --> 00:01:59.439
 tiny 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.710
 to see when changing the rare pills is 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.229
 that does not touch absolutely anything because the 

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:08.229
 disk is always a bit cloudy 

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:19.750
 we see that every time we touch less we are going to 

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:21.550
 loosen a little down now yes 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:24.120
 it leaves me 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.120
 not see it 

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:29.690
 oh it's going to be them they are absolutely nothing 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:33.010
 let's try to squeeze 

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.010
 and that does not sound anything 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:41.250
 to see that although it sounds a little 

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.250
 while the wheel turns 

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.840
 a wheel I'm just the sound of the 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:47.239
 wheel bearings 

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:50.150
 there it is then now we press the 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:52.880
 two screws and we have the clamp 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:56.330
 centered is usually the majority of 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:58.220
 cases that rubs the disk if you already 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.959
 doing this we did not take it away would be 

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:02.870
 question of removing the pills and 

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:05.520
 clean the pistons so they return 

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.650
 well in place 

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:10.740
 we have tightened the two screws 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:12.900
 the clip will choose the wheel and we see that 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:15.180
 It does not sound absolutely nothing but 

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.610
 creek bearings the weird that not 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.470
 rubbing nothing we can let it rub a little 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:22.110
 time that always changing the 

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:24.550
 Pads rubs a tad to be a bit 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:26.810
 fold the disc but it has been 

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:28.970
 very well 

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:30.620
 I hope you liked our public 

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:32.599
 today's bay so you can see only one 

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:35.330
 You can do the key of 5 

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:38.910
 home just center the clamp that is a 

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:41.420
 very common thing that rice the disc 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:41.420
 ah
