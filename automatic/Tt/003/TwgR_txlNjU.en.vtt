00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:08.069
 so that's the beginning I recovered 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:13.080
 you are going to pitch the tent is laid at 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:18.779
 about 20 to 30 cm we will work we will 

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:20.970
 put a guardian here nor twitter la rosa 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:24.449
 to be well packed and that's where 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.810
 start fire had to sign here on 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.390
 will cut and then 

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:31.629
 because the vine will start to grow have 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:35.210
 built to bud all this part 

00:00:31.629 --> 00:00:39.230
 so far andrade disbudded here and one 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:41.800
 will keep getting revenge in laye suffered from 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:44.390
 his hand to stay on 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:48.500
 okay okay so 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:50.240
 the goal to recap is to 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:53.060
 can redo 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:54.860
 at our feet do that both feet 

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:56.570
 flows between them not that sap 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:59.090
 circulates between the two feet by this 

00:00:56.570 --> 00:01:00.440
 bias there because yesterday yes they will 

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:05.480
 never independent finally the beds will be 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:07.910
 always connected always connected and that's it 

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:11.090
 so the more he goes he will recreate a 

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:13.670
 root system him the night here here is going 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:16.250
 there is an independent root system 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.150
 who will be frank as he did not 

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.340
 no transplants 

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.810
 while old vine she she has 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:24.050
 been grafted so year on a door 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:26.270
 transplants so this one we'll say this is 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.760
 a classic vine / rootstock then 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:32.060
 that here we really have to take the foot 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:35.690
 so the foot fram kick him 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:39.140
 which normally is more sensitive to 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:40.570
 phylloxera would risk in the time of 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:45.410
 do not perpetuate 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:47.180
 we think that being to continue 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:50.619
 to be connected to the old vine who she 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:54.080
 a graft door allows by this means 

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:55.520
 to minimize we'll say the impact of the 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.920
 junior assures the young man 

00:01:55.520 --> 00:02:01.039
 so a few years ago I spent 5 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:02.899
 6 years of hindsight it works very well 

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:04.970
 or if auxerre does not commit 

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:05.899
 still effects the driven leading so he 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:07.250
 should reach at least one 

00:02:05.899 --> 00:02:09.770
 twenty years to draw a 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:12.770
 conclusion but finally we'll say that 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:17.690
 already over 5 6 years and the normans 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:19.520
 result and the wood on what we are there 

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:23.240
 are quickly becoming very big withdrawal 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:24.830
 like an old town so still 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:27.680
 and it gives vigor to aiea la 

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:31.760
 old vine also or not that's it 

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:34.370
 Sasha does not play con ne the young 

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:38.540
 becomes and then everyone in my 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:41.000
 independent living and she may be less 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.380
 if not stronger than it has also 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.940
 vigorous to keep this is it 

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:45.940
 behind you well said it long
