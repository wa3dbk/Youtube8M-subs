00:00:17.109 --> 00:00:20.109
 mainz 

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:28.150
 as this game on the ubisoft 

00:00:26.109 --> 00:00:30.310
 press conference was shown at the e3 

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:32.290
 it has become really dead quiet problem 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:34.559
 Nobody really has that at all 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:34.559
 expected 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:42.630
 you're dead-silent too 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:45.239
 The graphic is an ideal that is so I have 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:47.040
 this trailer or this one 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.350
 seen scenes already once 

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.700
 and it was really the only one 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.030
 what I do from home from home 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:58.170
 where I have really followed so well 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:00.300
 a kind of goose bumps and yes, so stress 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.360
 felt so the atmosphere pursue 

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:06.869
 that was something completely unfamiliar 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:08.009
 unexpected and new teeth often 

00:01:06.869 --> 00:01:09.750
 material has been working since 

00:01:08.009 --> 00:01:10.530
 longer secret to it that is also 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.600
 nothing at all to the public 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.920
 devices 

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.539
 it will now know so much at the game 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.550
 we generally are the information 

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:18.240
 Relatively lazy on the e3 not too 

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:19.770
 betrayed a lot 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.600
 We know that in the near future 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.690
 you play masters plays in chicago 

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:27.030
 The hero is a guy named empires and 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:28.590
 For some reason, it can all 

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.720
 Systems of the city would have the city 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:32.220
 is ceo it by a computer program 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:34.289
 supervised and there he can 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.780
 ie it access to any destination 

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:39.020
 from traffic lights to bridge 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.020
 to mobile phones 

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:03.799
 the animation 

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:08.390
 what's up to story from this trailer too 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:11.930
 he can pull that is he somehow 

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:13.970
 a kind of hitman, too, is apparently yes 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.440
 and if you listen carefully you have to 

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.819
 example people in the club about the rain 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.290
 Wondering what does the country do 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:20.870
 that is, city ​​is also known 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:22.400
 to be and his goal is this demarco 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.260
 whose show he is right now is the one that shines 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.610
 to know him too and wants to end him 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:28.250
 from sometime to the leather 

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:30.950
 you do not know why but that still has 

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:32.480
 nobody betrayed here to be used 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.190
 By the way, one of his special hecking 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.319
 skills he can namely everyone 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.480
 Listening to people because all humans are 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:39.830
 electronically networked with each other and so on 

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.540
 not only can hear the conversation from 

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:44.209
 but also learns important parts about 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:49.459
 job about professions about criminal records or whether 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:51.670
 the one who wants him leather like this one 

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:51.670
 Type 

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:10.490
 there it finally got me off 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:11.660
 office chair elected yes and now comes 

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:13.250
 also with scenes on the ubisoft 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:15.050
 press conference not really people 

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:18.740
 have understood or can do together 

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:20.660
 not really that run for keeps 

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:22.190
 now uses the traffic lights 

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:25.510
 Turn the traffic light around by where it is 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:25.510
 needs to cause an accident 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.750
 to get her way 

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:36.920
 that really work in the finished game 

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.920
 can 

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:42.060
 May 

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:44.430
 the question is just what happens when you 

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:47.060
 push too early or too late or even 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:49.230
 do not push others 

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:51.660
 Solutions for the job 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:53.370
 gives as a giant big 

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:55.739
 question mark about it was a lot of things 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:57.209
 but has just seen time bomb 

00:03:55.739 --> 00:04:01.500
 used to shoot too interesting 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:02.819
 and he has a cover system that was yes 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.330
 also a bit to the trend on the 

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:07.140
 e3 that somehow everyone holds meanwhile 

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:10.500
 Anyway, a Swiss pocket knife 

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:13.340
 Everything must and above all, somewhere 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:13.340
 stick in the cover 

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:35.300
 that again a bit max payne 

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:38.120
 moderately I think so the shoot out or 

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:40.509
 tea or something else in his grand 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.509
 in the title 

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:48.999
 I would like to know why he does that 

00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:48.999
 makes 

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:55.219
 In any case, this has the brand as him 

00:04:53.689 --> 00:04:57.460
 then finally not really caught up 

00:04:55.219 --> 00:04:57.460
 too long 

00:05:11.630 --> 00:05:16.370
 typical of the example you can also cars 

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:17.570
 steal and jayden has one 

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:19.220
 special ability he can namely the 

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:21.050
 British at Chicago plays at the city 

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:22.730
 The bridges can be high and full of bridges 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:24.650
 shut down and use that now 

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:26.470
 Here come the cops goal fast 

00:05:24.650 --> 00:05:29.780
 vehicle 

00:05:26.470 --> 00:05:32.570
 bombel 1 of the hottest title 

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:35.170
 the fair and may be curious what that 

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:35.170
 in the end he will
