00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:09.330
 DNA consists of two compounds 

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:12.010
 Wrapped around each other in a double helical shape 

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:17.039
 Each compound is made up of four chemical bases 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:22.770
 Known as "A, C, G, T" 

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:25.000
 The two cars are complete with each other 

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:27.800
 This means that there is a "T" in the composite 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.300
 A "A" is needed in the corresponding vessel 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:32.330
 When "C" is in the first axle 

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:35.449
 "G" will be found in the corresponding vessel 

00:00:35.449 --> 00:00:38.900
 Both vehicles have a 5 "end and another 3" 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.260
 On two levels it works in opposite directions. 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:47.560
 This determines how each strand of DNA is copied. 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:52.690
 The first step in DNA replication is the separation of the two compounds 

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:55.980
 This is done by the enzyme dei helicase 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:01.000
 The results in the formation of the replication fork. 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:08.470
 Chapter branches provide each template to create a new branch of DNA. 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:13.000
 An enzyme called primase begins with a processor. 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.200
 This enzyme makes a small piece of RNA 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.310
 The primer is called. 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.210
 This represents a starting point for building new DNA. 

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.120
 The enzyme called polymerase polymerase binds primer 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:32.109
 It will make new DNA. 

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:36.600
 DNA polymerization can only add DNA bases in one direction, 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.500
 From 'end to 3' 5 finish. 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.000
 One of the new branches of DNA, a leading strand, 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.400
 Is continuously, 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:52.600
 DNA polymers add bases one by one in a 5 'to 3' direction. 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:57.520
 Another strand, stranded lag, can not be done this way continuously 

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:00.640
 Because it works in the opposite direction 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.300
 Thus DNA polymerization can only make this strand in a series of small pieces 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.000
 The fragments are called Okazaki. 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:18.000
 Each part was started with an RNA primer. 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.780
 DNA polymerization then adds short consecutive DNA bases 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.000
 In the direction of 5 'to 3'. 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.000
 Then the next primer is added further down the lagging strand. 

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:44.160
 Okazaki is then another part, and the process is repeated again. 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:47.260
 Once the new DNA has been made 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:53.000
 The nucleotide nucleotide enzyme removes all RNA primers from each strand of DNA. 

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.800
 The enzyme then fills another DNA polymerase gaps left behind 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:00.800
 With DNA. 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:08.590
 Finally the DNA enzyme seals the DNA up fragments of DNA 

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:13.000
 In both paths to form a continuous double strand. 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.260
 DNA replication is described as quasi-conservative 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:22.800
 Because each DNA molecule is made up of an old, strand-preserving DNA 

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:23.910
 One new one.
