00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:27.420
 Welcome to the protector of 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.949
 lego lp and if you thought so well 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.929
 pure place and I want 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.780
 start to the project and then people too 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.920
 found who would want to play with us 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.770
 not run places suffer now the 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:41.520
 is from school to start me here 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:43.920
 But one Saturday around that's okay 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.200
 he wants next and he is sick 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.289
 But he also comes in. I 'll get in touch 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.340
 Voluntarily for all my name 

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.469
 especially not my first 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.780
 spectators my name is philipp and main 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.719
 channel once even much gambled as 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.989
 here also main channel microsoft name like 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:02.100
 you can see up here and I think that 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:03.840
 is already the most important thing about 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.070
 me back there somewhere a plot 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.450
 that will be all right then 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.270
 because that's not the first one 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.799
 is the result but the 0 follow 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.840
 yes and I think now only can 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:16.439
 as if I turn to others this other 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:22.320
 strange types he so I think there is 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:27.479
 from club internet 7 and yes there is more 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:32.130
 not to say that everything is clear 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:35.180
 Now let's say yes catch the charm of 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.180
 has failed that is not so 

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:41.909
 that can not go on like this 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.100
 we start with that with the 

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.520
 presentation of the land or 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:49.290
 jovovich beginning 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:52.490
 I would say this stretched out here 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.490
 is the first plot of 

00:01:52.939 --> 00:02:00.710
 christoffers dlp yes, let's say 

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:00.710
 bit right times broke my heart 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:07.229
 just to the right 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.119
 I would also say that all clear 

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:10.739
 next property is my opinion 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.780
 for the best plot and also the 

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:15.420
 is my property 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.310

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:18.690

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.390

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.720
