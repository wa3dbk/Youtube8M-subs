00:00:07.435 --> 00:00:09.733
 In just 50 years, 

00:00:09.734 --> 00:00:13.322
 half of the planet's rainforests have been devastated. 

00:00:16.194 --> 00:00:19.452
 About 100 species of rainforests 

00:00:19.453 --> 00:00:21.388
 are extinguished every day, 

00:00:23.352 --> 00:00:26.187
 often without even being discovered. 

00:00:32.475 --> 00:00:35.231
 And it's not just animals and plants. 

00:00:35.654 --> 00:00:38.296
 We are also losing human cultures. 

00:00:38.297 --> 00:00:41.126
 which we hardly know. 

00:00:45.242 --> 00:00:48.249
 Even in the 21st century, 

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:53.027
 there are people living isolated from the rest of humanity, 

00:00:53.615 --> 00:00:56.737
 and practically everyone lives in the jungles. 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.286
 These huge unexplored forests 

00:01:03.287 --> 00:01:05.648
 are the only remaining sites on Earth 

00:01:05.649 --> 00:01:09.244
 where entire communities can live undetected. 

00:01:10.521 --> 00:01:15.225
 It is estimated that Brazil shelters about 70 isolated tribes, 

00:01:15.226 --> 00:01:18.328
 about 2/3 of the world total. 

00:01:21.335 --> 00:01:24.343
 Jose Carlos Meirelles works for FUNAI, 

00:01:24.344 --> 00:01:25.889
 government agency 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.366
 which protects the indigenous peoples of Brazil. 

00:01:29.179 --> 00:01:33.566
 Today, he hopes to find one of these isolated tribes. 

00:01:38.478 --> 00:01:41.516
 He must reach them before others do. 

00:02:00.721 --> 00:02:02.769
 Logging and mining 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.076
 forests and there are some who want to deny 

00:02:06.081 --> 00:02:09.318
 what isolated tribes live here. 

00:02:30.512 --> 00:02:32.869
 Meirelles needs evidence. 

00:02:33.117 --> 00:02:35.057
 The struggle to protect these peoples 

00:02:35.092 --> 00:02:39.174
 depends on proving and disclosing its existence. 

00:02:55.496 --> 00:02:59.093
 This is the first aerial shot 

00:02:59.094 --> 00:03:01.456
 of an isolated community. 

00:03:19.743 --> 00:03:24.094
 Little is known about his lifestyle and his language, 

00:03:24.953 --> 00:03:28.151
 and Meirelles prefers it to remain so. 

00:03:32.903 --> 00:03:35.130
 He has been working for 40 years. 

00:03:35.131 --> 00:03:38.237
 to protect tribes isolated from the outside world, 

00:03:38.238 --> 00:03:42.087
 but it is not as simple as leaving them alone. 

00:04:03.348 --> 00:04:05.904
 Using stabilized zoom lenses, 

00:04:05.905 --> 00:04:08.954
 it was possible to shoot 1 km away, 

00:04:08.955 --> 00:04:11.308
 minimizing the disturbance. 

00:04:11.993 --> 00:04:14.814
 Meirelles believes that the more people you know 

00:04:14.815 --> 00:04:16.816
 of the existence of such tribes, 

00:04:16.817 --> 00:04:20.455
 the more effective the struggle to preserve your lifestyle. 

00:04:58.944 --> 00:05:03.522
 The man survived here becoming part of the forest, 

00:05:03.523 --> 00:05:07.549
 but it is this specialization that makes you so vulnerable 

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:09.699
 in these times of change.
