I've<00:00:14.070> got<00:00:14.250> a<00:00:14.280> few<00:00:14.490> key<00:00:14.670> features<00:00:14.880> here<00:00:15.859> well

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
I've got a few key features here well

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:26.620 
I've got a few key features here well
six-speed<00:00:17.430> gear<00:00:17.880> set<00:00:18.090> at<00:00:18.210> the<00:00:18.270> back

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:26.630 

00:00:26.630 --> 00:01:25.530 

you

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:25.540 

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:28.170 

I'm<00:01:26.380> not<00:01:26.500> sure<00:01:26.590> on<00:01:26.650> the<00:01:26.740> price<00:01:26.980> check<00:01:27.970> it<00:01:28.090> out

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:28.180 
I'm not sure on the price check it out

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.520 
I'm not sure on the price check it out
on<00:01:28.300> their<00:01:28.420> website<00:01:28.570> maybe<00:01:29.700> and<00:01:31.140> with<00:01:32.140> battery

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:32.530 
on their website maybe and with battery

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.550 
on their website maybe and with battery
out<00:01:32.700> you<00:01:33.700> can<00:01:33.820> fold<00:01:34.000> them<00:01:34.120> up<00:01:34.240> move<00:01:34.570> around<00:01:34.840> the

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:35.560 
out you can fold them up move around the

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:37.800 
out you can fold them up move around the
battery<00:01:35.890> is<00:01:36.070> LED<00:01:36.850> acid<00:01:37.180> which<00:01:37.330> is<00:01:37.360> a<00:01:37.510> little

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
battery is LED acid which is a little

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.050 
battery is LED acid which is a little
bit<00:01:37.900> heavier<00:01:38.170> than<00:01:38.260> the<00:01:38.350> lithium's<00:01:38.910> still<00:01:39.910> I

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:40.060 
bit heavier than the lithium's still I

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:41.700 
bit heavier than the lithium's still I
think<00:01:40.210> it's<00:01:40.390> 12<00:01:40.600> amperes<00:01:40.960> oh<00:01:41.230> so<00:01:41.290> it's<00:01:41.500> still

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:41.710 
think it's 12 amperes oh so it's still

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:44.880 
think it's 12 amperes oh so it's still
pretty<00:01:41.860> decent<00:01:42.280> in<00:01:42.310> size<00:01:43.470> range<00:01:44.470> on<00:01:44.740> this

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:44.890 
pretty decent in size range on this

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.140 
pretty decent in size range on this
probably<00:01:45.370> about<00:01:45.880> forty<00:01:46.330> kilometers<00:01:48.150> with

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:49.150 
probably about forty kilometers with

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:52.200 
probably about forty kilometers with
pedal<00:01:49.570> assist<00:01:49.840> which<00:01:50.380> is<00:01:50.530> pretty<00:01:50.770> good<00:01:50.950> for<00:01:51.880> a

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 
pedal assist which is pretty good for a

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:55.530 
pedal assist which is pretty good for a
bike<00:01:52.420> of<00:01:52.570> this<00:01:52.720> price<00:01:54.000> it's<00:01:55.000> for<00:01:55.180> the<00:01:55.240> battery

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:55.540 
bike of this price it's for the battery

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.320 
bike of this price it's for the battery
and<00:01:55.600> then<00:01:55.720> go<00:01:55.840> for<00:01:55.990> a<00:01:56.020> quick<00:01:56.170> ride<00:01:57.060> so<00:01:58.060> before

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:58.330 
and then go for a quick ride so before

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:59.490 
and then go for a quick ride so before
we<00:01:58.420> take<00:01:58.540> it<00:01:58.660> for<00:01:58.750> a<00:01:58.810> quick<00:01:58.840> ride<00:01:59.140> quick

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500 
we take it for a quick ride quick

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:00.480 
we take it for a quick ride quick
feature<00:01:59.770> I<00:01:59.860> probably<00:02:00.070> should<00:02:00.280> have<00:02:00.310> mentioned

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:00.490 
feature I probably should have mentioned

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:02.609 
feature I probably should have mentioned
turn<00:02:01.360> the<00:02:01.479> bike<00:02:01.630> on<00:02:01.810> and<00:02:01.930> off<00:02:02.050> is<00:02:02.200> just<00:02:02.380> the<00:02:02.470> key

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:02.619 
turn the bike on and off is just the key

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:06.120 
turn the bike on and off is just the key
there<00:02:02.890> that's<00:02:03.550> it<00:02:03.790> so<00:02:04.360> with<00:02:04.930> that<00:02:05.050> on<00:02:05.290> twist

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:06.130 
there that's it so with that on twist

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:07.859 
there that's it so with that on twist
the<00:02:06.220> throttle<00:02:06.400> but<00:02:07.060> it's<00:02:07.210> also<00:02:07.330> got<00:02:07.600> pedal

00:02:07.859 --> 00:02:07.869 
the throttle but it's also got pedal

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:11.040 
the throttle but it's also got pedal
assist<00:02:08.140> as<00:02:08.350> well<00:02:08.380> which<00:02:09.340> is<00:02:09.369> on<00:02:09.840> all<00:02:10.840> the<00:02:10.990> time

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.050 
assist as well which is on all the time

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:15.840 
assist as well which is on all the time
by<00:02:11.350> default<00:02:11.880> Google<00:02:12.880> stands<00:02:14.640> then<00:02:15.640> out<00:02:15.790> the

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:15.850 
by default Google stands then out the

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:24.309 
by default Google stands then out the
way<00:02:15.940> let's<00:02:16.120> go

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:24.319 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:27.679 

so<00:02:25.319> the<00:02:25.439> gears<00:02:25.650> on<00:02:25.799> this<00:02:25.890> one<00:02:26.099> a<00:02:26.129> pretty<00:02:26.689> well

00:02:27.679 --> 00:02:27.689 
so the gears on this one a pretty well

00:02:27.689 --> 00:02:32.030 
so the gears on this one a pretty well
chosen<00:02:28.730> let's<00:02:29.730> go<00:02:29.849> to<00:02:29.909> first<00:02:30.360> gear<00:02:30.799> nice<00:02:31.799> and

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:32.040 
chosen let's go to first gear nice and

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:47.160 
chosen let's go to first gear nice and
low<00:02:32.269> pedal<00:02:33.269> assist<00:02:33.510> on

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170

don't<00:04:49.530> think<00:04:49.650> you<00:04:49.710> can<00:04:49.770> really<00:04:50.039> beat<00:04:50.250> this<00:04:50.400> for

00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:50.639 
don't think you can really beat this for

00:04:57.230 --> 00:04:57.240 
I'd probably give it seven sprockets out

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:01.550 
I'd probably give it seven sprockets out
