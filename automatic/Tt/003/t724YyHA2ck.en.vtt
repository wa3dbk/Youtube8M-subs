we're<00:05:02.430> ready<00:05:02.610> to<00:05:02.700> start<00:05:02.820> connecting<00:05:03.360> the

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:03.660 
we're ready to start connecting the

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:05.900 
we're ready to start connecting the
wires<00:05:03.870> so<00:05:04.320> you<00:05:04.349> can<00:05:04.650> see<00:05:04.919> how<00:05:05.099> everything<00:05:05.430> fits

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:05.910 
wires so you can see how everything fits

00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:09.140 
wires so you can see how everything fits
together<00:05:06.210> all<00:05:06.930> of<00:05:07.470> the<00:05:07.590> cables<00:05:08.130> are<00:05:08.430> keyed<00:05:08.849> all

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:09.150 
together all of the cables are keyed all

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:10.550 
together all of the cables are keyed all
the<00:05:09.300> connectors<00:05:09.780> are<00:05:09.930> keyed<00:05:10.139> to<00:05:10.260> each<00:05:10.380> other

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:10.560 
the connectors are keyed to each other

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:13.339 
the connectors are keyed to each other
so<00:05:10.770> they'll<00:05:10.889> only<00:05:11.070> go<00:05:11.310> in<00:05:11.520> one<00:05:11.550> way<00:05:11.820> and<00:05:12.360> just

00:05:13.339 --> 00:05:13.349 
so they'll only go in one way and just

00:05:13.349 --> 00:05:15.860 
so they'll only go in one way and just
simply<00:05:13.680> hook<00:05:14.610> everything<00:05:14.910> up<00:05:15.180> so<00:05:15.389> you<00:05:15.450> can<00:05:15.660> see

00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:15.870 
simply hook everything up so you can see

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:18.469 
simply hook everything up so you can see
how<00:05:16.020> it<00:05:16.139> all<00:05:16.229> goes<00:05:16.289> together<00:05:16.740> now<00:05:17.700> once<00:05:18.180> we<00:05:18.389> get

00:05:18.469 --> 00:05:18.479 
how it all goes together now once we get

00:05:18.479 --> 00:05:20.000 
how it all goes together now once we get
this<00:05:18.630> all<00:05:18.810> together<00:05:18.990> we're<00:05:19.349> basically<00:05:19.710> going

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:20.010 
this all together we're basically going

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:22.070 
this all together we're basically going
to<00:05:20.099> test<00:05:20.430> the<00:05:20.639> light<00:05:20.849> before<00:05:21.360> we<00:05:21.539> mount<00:05:21.720> it<00:05:21.960> to

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:22.080 
to test the light before we mount it to

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:25.670 
to test the light before we mount it to
make<00:05:22.470> sure<00:05:22.500> everything<00:05:23.099> works<00:05:24.320> now<00:05:25.320> you<00:05:25.349> can

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:25.680 
make sure everything works now you can

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:27.290 
make sure everything works now you can
plug<00:05:25.889> the<00:05:26.070> head<00:05:26.250> light<00:05:26.430> fixture<00:05:26.820> back<00:05:27.060> into

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:27.300 
plug the head light fixture back into

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:29.120 
plug the head light fixture back into
the<00:05:27.389> bike<00:05:27.539> turn<00:05:27.990> the<00:05:28.139> bike<00:05:28.260> on<00:05:28.500> and<00:05:28.770> make<00:05:29.099> sure

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:29.130 
the bike turn the bike on and make sure

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:32.300 
the bike turn the bike on and make sure
the<00:05:29.460> lights<00:05:29.669> work<00:05:29.940> before<00:05:30.450> proceeding<00:05:31.310> it's

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:32.310 
the lights work before proceeding it's

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:33.950 
the lights work before proceeding it's
important<00:05:32.880> to<00:05:32.970> clean<00:05:33.240> the<00:05:33.270> inside<00:05:33.780> of<00:05:33.900> the

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:33.960 
important to clean the inside of the

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:35.750 
important to clean the inside of the
fairing<00:05:34.349> underneath<00:05:34.979> where<00:05:35.310> the<00:05:35.340> turn

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:35.760 
fairing underneath where the turn

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:37.339 
fairing underneath where the turn
signals<00:05:36.300> are<00:05:36.419> mounted<00:05:36.750> because<00:05:36.870> that's<00:05:37.169> where

00:05:37.339 --> 00:05:37.349 
signals are mounted because that's where

00:05:37.349 --> 00:05:39.800 
signals are mounted because that's where
we're<00:05:37.440> going<00:05:37.560> to<00:05:37.620> mount<00:05:37.860> our<00:05:38.130> ballasts<00:05:38.880> here

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:39.810 
we're going to mount our ballasts here

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:42.950 
we're going to mount our ballasts here
you<00:05:39.960> can<00:05:40.169> see<00:05:40.380> how<00:05:40.620> I've<00:05:40.770> sort<00:05:41.160> of<00:05:41.870> routed<00:05:42.870> the

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:42.960 
you can see how I've sort of routed the

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:45.570 
you can see how I've sort of routed the
wires<00:05:43.200> from<00:05:43.590> the<00:05:43.710> ballast<00:05:44.280> through<00:05:44.880> to<00:05:45.270> the

00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:45.580 
wires from the ballast through to the

00:05:45.580 --> 00:05:47.580 
wires from the ballast through to the
headlight<00:05:45.909> area<00:05:46.569> and<00:05:46.780> that's<00:05:47.349> where

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:47.590 
headlight area and that's where

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:49.140 
headlight area and that's where
everything<00:05:47.830> will<00:05:48.069> be<00:05:48.129> hooked<00:05:48.520> up<00:05:48.789> but<00:05:49.060> the

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:49.150 
everything will be hooked up but the

00:05:49.150 --> 00:05:51.719 
everything will be hooked up but the
ballast<00:05:49.659> and<00:05:49.840> the<00:05:50.199> ballast<00:05:51.009> box<00:05:51.310> will<00:05:51.699> be

00:05:51.719 --> 00:05:51.729 
ballast and the ballast box will be

00:05:51.729 --> 00:05:55.219 
ballast and the ballast box will be
mounted<00:05:52.389> underneath<00:05:53.289> the<00:05:53.590> turn<00:05:53.800> signal

00:05:55.219 --> 00:05:55.229 
mounted underneath the turn signal

mounted underneath the turn signal
notice<00:05:56.229> how<00:05:56.349> everything<00:05:56.650> in<00:05:56.860> this<00:05:57.009> picture

00:05:57.390 --> 00:05:57.400 
notice how everything in this picture

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:59.640 
notice how everything in this picture
has<00:05:57.580> been<00:05:57.610> reconnected<00:05:58.599> the<00:05:58.629> h4<00:05:59.139> connectors

00:05:59.640 --> 00:05:59.650 
has been reconnected the h4 connectors

00:05:59.650 --> 00:06:04.709 
has been reconnected the h4 connectors
and<00:05:59.830> the<00:06:00.250> waterproof<00:06:00.789> connectors<00:06:03.569> it's<00:06:04.569> a

00:06:04.709 --> 00:06:04.719 
and the waterproof connectors it's a

00:06:04.719 --> 00:06:07.110 
and the waterproof connectors it's a
good<00:06:04.990> idea<00:06:05.169> to<00:06:05.439> secure<00:06:05.979> the<00:06:06.129> h4<00:06:06.580> connectors

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:07.120 
good idea to secure the h4 connectors

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:08.939 
good idea to secure the h4 connectors
using<00:06:07.509> one<00:06:07.810> of<00:06:07.900> the<00:06:07.990> cable<00:06:08.349> ties<00:06:08.590> that's
