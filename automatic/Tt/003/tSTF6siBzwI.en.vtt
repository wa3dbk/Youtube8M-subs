00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:12.640 
is pocket infrared thermometer you may

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:15.000 
is pocket infrared thermometer you may
have<00:00:12.760> seen<00:00:13.000> us<00:00:13.150> use<00:00:13.360> this<00:00:13.720> other<00:00:14.010> infrared

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:15.010 
have seen us use this other infrared

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:17.880 
have seen us use this other infrared
thermometer<00:00:15.640> in<00:00:15.760> other<00:00:15.910> videos<00:00:16.299> and<00:00:16.779> this<00:00:17.500> is

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:17.890 
thermometer in other videos and this is

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:19.769 
thermometer in other videos and this is
our<00:00:18.070> like<00:00:18.220> 40<00:00:18.580> bucks<00:00:18.730> 50<00:00:19.180> bucks<00:00:19.210> depending<00:00:19.690> on

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:19.779 
our like 40 bucks 50 bucks depending on

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:21.870 
our like 40 bucks 50 bucks depending on
where<00:00:19.930> you<00:00:19.990> get<00:00:20.170> them<00:00:20.260> this<00:00:20.920> one<00:00:21.130> was<00:00:21.340> 20<00:00:21.520> bucks

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:21.880 
where you get them this one was 20 bucks

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.400 
where you get them this one was 20 bucks
at<00:00:22.119> the<00:00:22.300> shack<00:00:22.689> and<00:00:24.390> basically<00:00:25.390> it's<00:00:25.600> a<00:00:25.780> whim

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:26.410 
at the shack and basically it's a whim

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:28.500 
at the shack and basically it's a whim
purchased<00:00:26.980> I<00:00:27.190> leave<00:00:27.760> this<00:00:27.940> thing<00:00:28.180> at<00:00:28.330> the

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:28.510 
purchased I leave this thing at the

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:31.410 
purchased I leave this thing at the
computers<00:00:29.230> too<00:00:29.410> often<00:00:29.830> and<00:00:30.240> when<00:00:31.240> we're<00:00:31.360> out

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:31.420 
computers too often and when we're out

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:33.000 
computers too often and when we're out
at<00:00:31.510> the<00:00:31.600> range<00:00:31.810> or<00:00:32.020> something<00:00:32.349> I<00:00:32.500> wish<00:00:32.650> I<00:00:32.800> had<00:00:32.980> a

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.010 
at the range or something I wish I had a

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.040 
at the range or something I wish I had a
thermometer<00:00:33.699> so<00:00:34.480> I<00:00:34.510> thought<00:00:34.750> maybe<00:00:34.900> this

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:35.050 
thermometer so I thought maybe this

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.549 
thermometer so I thought maybe this
would<00:00:35.949> fill<00:00:36.190> in<00:00:36.309> the<00:00:36.460> gap<00:00:36.879> for<00:00:37.180> us<00:00:37.239> there<00:00:37.570> so<00:00:38.440> it

00:00:38.549 --> 00:00:38.559 
would fill in the gap for us there so it

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:41.340 
would fill in the gap for us there so it
just<00:00:38.590> comes<00:00:38.949> with<00:00:39.040> some<00:00:39.780> quick<00:00:40.780> paperwork

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:41.350 
just comes with some quick paperwork

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:48.220 
just comes with some quick paperwork
here

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:48.230 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.069 

here<00:00:48.829> so<00:00:49.070> we're<00:00:49.190> going<00:00:49.340> to<00:00:49.460> unscrew<00:00:50.210> it<00:00:50.239> now

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:51.079 
here so we're going to unscrew it now

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:52.750 
here so we're going to unscrew it now
what<00:00:51.230> I<00:00:51.260> was<00:00:51.470> impressed<00:00:51.800> with<00:00:52.070> you<00:00:52.670> know

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:52.760 
what I was impressed with you know

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:54.310 
what I was impressed with you know
sometimes<00:00:53.150> you<00:00:53.270> buy<00:00:53.390> stuff<00:00:53.630> at<00:00:53.809> Rio<00:00:53.989> Shack

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:54.320 
sometimes you buy stuff at Rio Shack

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:55.990 
sometimes you buy stuff at Rio Shack
sometimes<00:00:54.770> it's<00:00:54.920> good<00:00:55.190> sometimes<00:00:55.340> it<00:00:55.850> isn't

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:56.000 
sometimes it's good sometimes it isn't

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.180 
sometimes it's good sometimes it isn't
this<00:00:56.690> seemed<00:00:56.960> pretty<00:00:57.170> decent<00:00:57.650> I'm<00:00:57.829> just

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.190 
this seemed pretty decent I'm just

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.390 
this seemed pretty decent I'm just
looking<00:00:58.430> at<00:00:58.550> the<00:00:58.670> quality<00:00:58.879> of<00:00:59.180> it<00:01:00.010> I'm<00:01:01.010> pulling

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:01.400 
looking at the quality of it I'm pulling

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.069 
looking at the quality of it I'm pulling
out<00:01:01.520> a<00:01:01.550> little<00:01:01.760> clear<00:01:02.059> piece<00:01:02.270> of<00:01:02.300> plastic<00:01:02.449> here

00:01:03.069 --> 00:01:03.079 
out a little clear piece of plastic here

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:04.749 
out a little clear piece of plastic here
that<00:01:03.260> keeps<00:01:03.470> the<00:01:03.620> batteries<00:01:03.980> from<00:01:04.159> working<00:01:04.519> so

00:01:04.749 --> 00:01:04.759 
that keeps the batteries from working so

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:06.219 
that keeps the batteries from working so
it<00:01:04.850> doesn't<00:01:05.119> accidentally<00:01:05.570> go<00:01:05.750> off<00:01:05.780> in<00:01:06.140> the

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:06.229 
it doesn't accidentally go off in the

00:01:06.229 --> 00:01:08.230 
it doesn't accidentally go off in the
packaging<00:01:06.710> I<00:01:06.800> guess<00:01:07.009> but<00:01:07.729> you<00:01:07.790> can<00:01:07.970> close<00:01:08.119> a

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:08.240 
packaging I guess but you can close a

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:09.580 
packaging I guess but you can close a
little<00:01:08.330> overhang<00:01:08.780> in<00:01:08.960> there<00:01:09.170> and<00:01:09.290> it<00:01:09.380> seems

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590 
little overhang in there and it seems

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.370 
little overhang in there and it seems
pretty<00:01:09.800> decent<00:01:10.040> it's<00:01:10.820> rubberized<00:01:11.360> so<00:01:12.080> I<00:01:12.110> like

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:12.380 
pretty decent it's rubberized so I like

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:17.550 
pretty decent it's rubberized so I like
that<00:01:12.680> and<00:01:14.140> we're<00:01:15.140> getting<00:01:15.259> 96<00:01:16.009> right<00:01:16.220> now<00:01:16.430> 87

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:17.560 
that and we're getting 96 right now 87

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.800 
that and we're getting 96 right now 87
so<00:01:18.729> let's<00:01:19.729> compare<00:01:20.119> it<00:01:20.240> let's<00:01:20.390> see<00:01:20.539> if<00:01:20.630> it

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:20.810 
so let's compare it let's see if it

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.840 
so let's compare it let's see if it
works<00:01:22.330> it<00:01:23.330> says<00:01:23.539> it<00:01:23.720> can<00:01:23.840> do<00:01:24.080> from<00:01:24.470> negative<00:01:25.070> 27

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
works it says it can do from negative 27

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:31.810 
works it says it can do from negative 27
to<00:01:27.160> 230<00:01:28.160> so<00:01:29.090> I'm<00:01:29.180> hoping<00:01:29.600> that<00:01:29.660> you<00:01:30.820> know

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:31.820 
to 230 so I'm hoping that you know

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.560 
to 230 so I'm hoping that you know
that'll<00:01:32.180> take<00:01:32.210> us<00:01:32.539> enough<00:01:32.869> range<00:01:33.170> that<00:01:33.590> will

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:34.570 
that'll take us enough range that will

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:36.639 
that'll take us enough range that will
it'll<00:01:35.570> be<00:01:35.630> useful<00:01:36.140> for<00:01:36.289> some<00:01:36.470> of<00:01:36.560> the<00:01:36.619> things

00:01:36.639 --> 00:01:36.649 
it'll be useful for some of the things

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:40.150 
it'll be useful for some of the things
we<00:01:36.950> do<00:01:37.600> since<00:01:38.600> they<00:01:38.750> both<00:01:39.050> will<00:01:39.440> work<00:01:39.710> with<00:01:39.979> it

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:40.160 
we do since they both will work with it

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.010 
we do since they both will work with it
let's<00:01:40.429> use<00:01:40.610> an<00:01:40.789> indicator<00:01:41.270> that<00:01:41.390> should<00:01:41.810> work

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
let's use an indicator that should work

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:45.300 
let's use an indicator that should work
the<00:01:42.679> same<00:01:42.710> on<00:01:43.100> both<00:01:43.130> and<00:01:43.670> that'll<00:01:43.910> be<00:01:44.060> this<00:01:44.270> ice

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:45.310 
the same on both and that'll be this ice

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:47.620 
the same on both and that'll be this ice
should<00:01:46.310> be<00:01:46.340> the<00:01:46.580> same<00:01:46.789> temperature<00:01:47.210> because

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:47.630 
should be the same temperature because

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.350 
should be the same temperature because
ice<00:01:47.780> is<00:01:48.050> a<00:01:48.080> universal<00:01:48.679> temperature<00:01:49.179> so<00:01:50.179> we've

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:50.360 
ice is a universal temperature so we've

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:55.690 
ice is a universal temperature so we've
got<00:01:50.600> 41<00:01:51.530> degrees<00:01:51.950> here<00:01:53.979> right<00:01:54.979> at<00:01:55.160> the<00:01:55.190> top<00:01:55.310> of

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:55.700 
got 41 degrees here right at the top of

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:03.669 
got 41 degrees here right at the top of
the<00:01:55.789> cup<00:01:57.520> 44<00:01:58.520> degrees<00:01:58.849> this<00:01:59.060> time<00:02:02.470> we've<00:02:03.470> got

00:02:03.669 --> 00:02:03.679 
the cup 44 degrees this time we've got

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:06.699 
the cup 44 degrees this time we've got
35<00:02:04.069> degrees<00:02:04.640> over<00:02:05.000> here<00:02:05.239> so<00:02:05.539> looks<00:02:06.229> like<00:02:06.349> one

00:02:06.699 --> 00:02:06.709 
35 degrees over here so looks like one

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:09.300 
35 degrees over here so looks like one
of<00:02:06.830> these<00:02:06.950> might<00:02:07.220> need<00:02:07.399> to<00:02:07.520> be<00:02:07.640> calibrated<00:02:07.910> or

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
of these might need to be calibrated or

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:14.380 
of these might need to be calibrated or
we<00:02:10.310> just<00:02:10.550> found<00:02:10.670> a<00:02:10.849> new<00:02:12.970> interesting<00:02:13.970> thing<00:02:14.239> to

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:14.390 
we just found a new interesting thing to

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.390 
we just found a new interesting thing to
test<00:02:14.630> out<00:02:14.840> or<00:02:15.020> something<00:02:15.349> here<00:02:15.500> so<00:02:15.620> we<00:02:15.709> got<00:02:15.860> 36

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:16.400 
test out or something here so we got 36

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.670 
test out or something here so we got 36
degrees<00:02:16.760> there

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:20.680 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.850 

yep<00:02:21.280> 45<00:02:21.879> degrees<00:02:22.290> it's<00:02:23.290> got<00:02:23.470> a<00:02:23.500> little<00:02:23.620> closer

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
yep 45 degrees it's got a little closer

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:28.470 
yep 45 degrees it's got a little closer
now<00:02:26.860> we've<00:02:27.069> got<00:02:27.250> twenty<00:02:27.610> six<00:02:27.939> point<00:02:28.239> five

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:28.480 
now we've got twenty six point five

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.850 
now we've got twenty six point five
degrees<00:02:30.510> let's<00:02:31.510> go<00:02:31.689> to<00:02:31.780> Celsius<00:02:32.349> which<00:02:32.620> should

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
degrees let's go to Celsius which should

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:38.789 
degrees let's go to Celsius which should
be<00:02:32.980> zero<00:02:33.340> at<00:02:33.549> freezing<00:02:37.019> and<00:02:38.019> we've<00:02:38.170> got<00:02:38.409> point

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:38.799 
be zero at freezing and we've got point

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:46.530 
be zero at freezing and we've got point
four<00:02:40.200> will<00:02:41.200> flip<00:02:41.560> to<00:02:41.590> Celsius<00:02:42.340> here<00:02:45.329> and<00:02:46.329> we've

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
four will flip to Celsius here and we've

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.660 
four will flip to Celsius here and we've
got<00:02:46.569> two<00:02:47.109> so<00:02:47.590> that<00:02:47.709> tells<00:02:47.950> us<00:02:48.099> that<00:02:48.310> this<00:02:48.459> one

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:48.670 
got two so that tells us that this one

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:51.300 
got two so that tells us that this one
might<00:02:48.849> be<00:02:48.879> the<00:02:49.060> one<00:02:49.150> that's<00:02:49.390> a<00:02:49.480> little<00:02:49.599> high<00:02:50.310> -

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
might be the one that's a little high -

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:54.990 
might be the one that's a little high -
let's<00:02:51.670> take<00:02:51.760> it<00:02:51.909> way<00:02:52.060> in<00:02:52.299> there<00:02:53.489> one<00:02:54.489> so<00:02:54.849> this

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:55.000 
let's take it way in there one so this

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.180 
let's take it way in there one so this
one<00:02:55.180> might<00:02:55.359> be<00:02:55.420> a<00:02:55.569> little<00:02:55.780> high<00:02:56.049> we'll<00:02:57.010> take

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.190 
one might be a little high we'll take

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:58.920 
one might be a little high we'll take
this<00:02:57.400> one<00:02:57.670> and<00:02:57.819> have<00:02:58.209> it<00:02:58.239> right<00:02:58.540> down<00:02:58.720> there

00:02:58.920 --> 00:02:58.930 
this one and have it right down there

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:02.399 
this one and have it right down there
near<00:02:59.200> the<00:02:59.349> ice<00:03:00.239> and<00:03:01.239> we're<00:03:01.450> at<00:03:01.569> two<00:03:01.810> point<00:03:02.139> two

00:03:02.399 --> 00:03:02.409 
near the ice and we're at two point two

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:05.369 
near the ice and we're at two point two
and<00:03:02.920> if<00:03:03.040> I<00:03:03.159> touch<00:03:03.459> the<00:03:03.639> ice<00:03:03.790> road<00:03:04.060> actually<00:03:04.379> and

00:03:05.369 --> 00:03:05.379 
and if I touch the ice road actually and

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:07.530 
and if I touch the ice road actually and
then<00:03:05.530> we'll<00:03:05.709> go<00:03:06.489> in<00:03:06.639> there<00:03:06.819> again<00:03:06.970> really

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:07.540 
then we'll go in there again really

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.910 
then we'll go in there again really
close<00:03:07.810> to<00:03:07.989> the<00:03:08.079> ice<00:03:09.810> to<00:03:10.810> point<00:03:11.139> our<00:03:11.409> negative

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
close to the ice to point our negative

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:16.920 
close to the ice to point our negative
2.6<00:03:12.900> we'll<00:03:13.900> come<00:03:14.079> up<00:03:14.109> here<00:03:14.230> to<00:03:14.530> the<00:03:14.650> top<00:03:15.810> and<00:03:16.810> we

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:16.930 
2.6 we'll come up here to the top and we

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.369 
2.6 we'll come up here to the top and we
get<00:03:17.109> an<00:03:17.200> eight<00:03:18.659> you're<00:03:19.659> getting<00:03:19.840> really<00:03:20.170> close

00:03:20.369 --> 00:03:20.379 
get an eight you're getting really close

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:27.000 
get an eight you're getting really close
to<00:03:20.439> the<00:03:20.620> ice<00:03:23.669> and<00:03:24.669> we<00:03:24.790> got<00:03:24.940> a<00:03:24.970> true<00:03:25.410> 0.4<00:03:26.410> come<00:03:26.889> up

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.010 
to the ice and we got a true 0.4 come up

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:34.170 
to the ice and we got a true 0.4 come up
here<00:03:27.190> to<00:03:27.310> the<00:03:27.400> top<00:03:30.780> and<00:03:31.780> we<00:03:31.870> write<00:03:31.989> a<00:03:32.019> 1<00:03:32.139> so<00:03:33.180> why

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:34.180 
here to the top and we write a 1 so why

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.720 
here to the top and we write a 1 so why
is<00:03:34.329> interesting<00:03:34.900> I'm<00:03:35.859> gonna<00:03:36.069> blow<00:03:36.310> into<00:03:36.519> the

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:36.730 
is interesting I'm gonna blow into the

00:03:36.730 --> 00:03:47.520 
is interesting I'm gonna blow into the
cup<00:03:36.940> there<00:03:39.750> we<00:03:40.750> got<00:03:40.930> a<00:03:40.959> four<00:03:41.260> point<00:03:41.560> four<00:03:46.530> and

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:47.530 
cup there we got a four point four and

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:55.759 
cup there we got a four point four and
we<00:03:47.620> still<00:03:47.829> get<00:03:47.889> that<00:03:48.069> one<00:03:48.280> point<00:03:48.639> four<00:03:52.979> 34

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:55.769 
we still get that one point four 34

00:03:55.769 --> 00:04:02.800 
we still get that one point four 34
switch<00:03:56.769> this<00:03:56.980> back

thought<00:05:22.150> it<00:05:22.270> would<00:05:22.360> have<00:05:22.419> been<00:05:22.540> a<00:05:22.570> great<00:05:22.870> asset

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:23.080 
thought it would have been a great asset

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:25.500 
thought it would have been a great asset

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:25.510 
to the range bag to help us check out

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:28.129 
to the range bag to help us check out
temperatures<00:05:25.930> on<00:05:26.380> barrels<00:05:26.949> or<00:05:27.250> suppressors

00:05:28.129 --> 00:05:28.139 
temperatures on barrels or suppressors

00:05:28.139 --> 00:05:30.570 
temperatures on barrels or suppressors
even<00:05:29.139> on<00:05:29.260> optics<00:05:29.770> or<00:05:29.979> just<00:05:30.220> the<00:05:30.400> ambient

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:30.580 
even on optics or just the ambient

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:33.360 
even on optics or just the ambient
temperature<00:05:31.000> outside<00:05:31.600> but<00:05:31.870> doesn't<00:05:32.770> seem

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:33.370 
temperature outside but doesn't seem

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:36.080 
temperature outside but doesn't seem
like<00:05:33.870> it's<00:05:34.870> gonna<00:05:34.960> work<00:05:35.080> for<00:05:35.470> us

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:36.090 
like it's gonna work for us

00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:38.189 
like it's gonna work for us
luckily<00:05:37.090> it<00:05:37.300> looks<00:05:37.479> like<00:05:37.630> it'll<00:05:37.840> be<00:05:37.870> easy<00:05:38.080> to

00:05:38.189 --> 00:05:38.199 
luckily it looks like it'll be easy to

00:05:38.199 --> 00:05:57.110 
luckily it looks like it'll be easy to
put<00:05:38.470> back<00:05:38.650> into<00:05:38.680> its<00:05:39.040> packaging
