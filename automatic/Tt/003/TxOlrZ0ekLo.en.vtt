00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:10.280
 I do not know what will work but here it is here 

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:15.139
 Toward ssd 

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:16.720
 Try to migrate the system a bit or reinstall os 

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:21.369
 I would like to 

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:24.880
 Still this is half disk such a feeling here ssd 

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:30.310
 The difference between the size and weight of this kind of Ne is amazing 

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:31.280
 Mirrored the ne ss dick 256 Iga City What I it just a little worry is too late 

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:34.490
 I understand 

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:38.600
 Mountain ne another of 1.2 temple hesitation in this computer 

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:44.530
 First of all that this ssb a hit data is clogged 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:44.530
 I want to attach this ssd to the body for a moment 

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:55.660
 Well, I 'll leave it outside like this 

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:59.290
 I installed this ssd, but it is not recognized that this is only for example now 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:01:04.000
 It's like that, it's like that, but there are a few hard disks 

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:06.970
 c I'm fishing the drive hard drive and the external hard disk 1 seller but now 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:11.920
 It does not appear in the attached usd noppo 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:17.050
 In case of windows 10 you have to be able to view hard disks here 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:18.690
 Kutte implanted in'll When the creation of the Hardy clothing partition towards the top and format 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:24.550
 It comes out to say handle 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:28.720
 I'll select here Then here came out of Tteyuu Disk Management 

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:33.510
 In fact struck, but now that the Tteyuu I'm there is that if the disk of graduation now disc 2 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:35.820
 This indicates a master boot record, as it indicates the installed f sd 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:41.370
 I will try ok here 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:42.510
 And here 's a preference assignment of disc 2 Right click and simple 

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:45.510
 It is a volume 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:50.020
 Select new simple vol 2 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:54.549
 If you do so, you will be successful through the wizard of simple volume 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:58.380
 Here it is carried out you drive of the assignment is you have for the child of Masu in the region to 

00:01:54.549 --> 00:02:03.580
 Stay good without changing this time 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:06.380
 Next to N ntfs page vol 9 or later even if the file 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:11.440
 That line on the map 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:14.920
 There is a condition that is formatted by this and the drive comes to be 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:19.750
 Yes a normal or would you know that I am seeing here. 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:21.680
 Evo Li also came out good drive of the volume was not just this is ssd 

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:26.900
 Now you can recognize 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:31.879
 But this I'm kinda intention of ssd of it is I Well is the preparation stage 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:34.030
 There were too many hard disks before the transition so click here for a bit 

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:37.850
 You will see and see 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:41.360
 The hard disk 3 Tirano Cardiff 

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:46.790
 spira how little sloppy and data capacity 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:49.940
 I 'm starting with a terabyte hard disk clone now 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:52.970
 The windows are up right now, but the windows are 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:56.270
 I copied the data with this clone 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:57.840
 Starting from Tilabite hard disk 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:03.900
 As the hard disk 

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:06.989
 I will cut the amount to about 250 and try to make a little clone to ssd 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:09.470
 I wish it was a really clean install 

00:03:06.989 --> 00:03:13.190
 Well just stick to the clone this time 

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:17.660
 I think I want to move to ssd for a moment now 

00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:21.350
 Yes , finally here is a clone from hard disk to hard disk 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:25.610
 Finished and reduced capacity towards ssd 

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:29.490
 I want to transfer the data of Utsu's PC 

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:33.569
 Come on and put on a hard disk temporarily and click here 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:34.860
 S sto of plan freshness I have protruding to the outside 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:38.460
 I 'm sticking 

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:43.470
 I think that now you want to create a clone in the free software of data 

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:47.690
 Some people may recommend other software for clones, but if it continues to be great, this is fine. 

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:51.050
 A major good child Azu and Todo backup 

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:55.820
 I'm selling this and it's so easy. 

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:56.720
 Because there is a place called here, this clone comes out by selecting the place 

00:03:55.820 --> 00:04:01.970
 hard disk 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:05.750
 First, the total number this Now it is the guy made on the basis of that is to say the hard disk to zero 

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:07.680
 The product has a clone hard disk prepared in reserve 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:09.700
 I'm confusing, so this 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:14.860
 Select and proceed to the next 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:15.489
 It is too much Ise this time to protect to the target hard disk from the next source 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:19.750
 in the case of 

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:25.480
 This ssd hard disk one patient's transcend ssd this time 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:29.260
 Which from here to proceed next in so Then Zeng Suo Metropolitan in the towards the target disk 

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:29.720
 You can see it with a meter if you have enough capacity 

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:31.849
 107 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:33.699
 Hey since end up buying heavy machinery is about 

00:04:31.849 --> 00:04:38.050
 In Jikko this 

00:04:33.699 --> 00:04:43.509
 In will erase the data on the target disk will continue if yes no problem 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:45.870
 If you leave it as it is, ssd's hard disk environment is 

00:04:43.509 --> 00:04:49.980
 Will be copied entirely 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:54.090
 Uzzah work a little I once Nde do must come off after this hair 

00:04:49.980 --> 00:05:00.060
 Allowed to leave will come off a little hair from about 1 hour 2 hours 

00:04:54.090 --> 00:05:00.570
 Outing cormorants entered Yes Now that we have cut now hair in I would like to do more of the work after this 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:05.490
 I will 

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:05.889
 A little from here so was able to transfer the system to here Transcend ssd now 

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:10.300
 Start-up 

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:14.590
 Because in it, even if I would like to the people here system is crawling now 

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:18.620
 Yes transcend ts 256 gssd 370 s 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:21.820
 Because you Yes according to the here I'll try if this remains little can be started 

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:21.820
 Entered bread 

00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:25.090
 Ah ah ah ah 

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:25.090
 Correct 

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:30.100
 I wonder if rises 

00:05:27.569 --> 00:05:35.820
 Still came came up to temperature 

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:37.550
 Soooo crawling game until the start Yes Hey Hey I was accidentally cut 

00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:40.820
 Such a haim 

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:45.530
 A little surprised 1 center of hard at all 

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:51.600
 A little like this time the difference between the speed of the hard disk and the trajectory of ssd 

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:55.860
 Just sorry I super not fast Kai impressions of you is but a little Usan not raise the comparison video 

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:59.640
 The act understood people's feelings that it wanted to make ssd a start disk by this 

00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:05.010
 I think many people already use it with ssd 

00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:08.610
 It is speed difference 5 PC 3 various sound software starts but 

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:11.590
 I pretty until the end of its orbit 

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:14.560
 I wonder if I have to wait for a minute or so Cloud Server 

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:19.760
 If it is my sister, it is all blue and blue 

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:24.590
 If you start this ssd now by the time it is up and set up 

00:06:19.760 --> 00:06:29.420
 It has been started and can be used in about 30 seconds of entering minutes 

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:34.430
 Wow the system to ssd rough-hewn from the hard disk in such Fu in this 

00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:39.080
 Migration to the case of Well Usa but is Mitan in there or the amount of data it now fills up a little in 

00:06:34.430 --> 00:06:39.750
 Software work does not stand up well even if I try to keep working as it is because there is 

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:43.950
 Or 

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:47.040
 There are a lot of problems in various ways, but it's just Clon, and the capacity is great. 

00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:51.550
 As there are more and more clone disks, so do games 

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:56.830
 ぅ I can't make settings so I can check it in a little 

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:57.940
 I do not know whether it will be used with ssd as it is, but it is very convenient to start up and very convenient 

00:06:56.830 --> 00:07:01.060
 I felt that 

00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:05.770
 It is highly recommended to launch ssd 

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:07.270
 It will take a lot of time after this to put the working environment back to its original state 

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:10.480
 So once 

00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:11.540
 The green of the western digital we used more 

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:16.430
 Run here 

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:18.820
 Edit Today's videos I am allowed to and also to the hard disk 

00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:22.960
 You I think that attempts at do 

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:26.860
 Story of loosely personal computer Mendokuse lie in a channel like this 

00:07:22.960 --> 00:07:30.850
 Since doing story full of gadgets, I need your help by all means towards the channel registration 

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:32.020
 In addition, in please my best regards the vortex of the road it will be very easy to see when you subscribe 

00:07:30.850 --> 00:07:37.510
 Paia in another video 

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:38.810
 This time it was heard that those hair and professional people, so I have it firmly 

00:07:37.510 --> 00:07:41.500
 I think that there 

00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:41.500
 We take the
