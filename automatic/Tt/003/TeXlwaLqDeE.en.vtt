00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.080
 Hello today I show you as you 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.330
 cook sausages in dressing gown 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:09.630
 could for two servings you need 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:11.340
 much spice some spice ketchup her 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:13.230
 You can also take tomato ketchup but 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.150
 spice ketchup I think brings more 

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.859
 taste in the sleep skirt and the 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.109
 Fabric is made of fresh puff pastry 

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:20.640
 there you can either puff pastry 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:25.140
 Take a role or you can too 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:27.119
 Thaw frozen puff pastry as 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:32.330
 First you have to clear the country day 

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:32.330
 and n64 cut equal rectangles 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:43.410
 First, the Rhine ferry still takes 

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.239
 wish it could be something else 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:49.309
 but it is not necessary and 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:53.670
 give some curry ketchup in the middle 

00:00:49.309 --> 00:00:57.600
 not too much else that is different 

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:59.850
 the sausage pajamas that passes 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:03.049
 you are not quite up to it either 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:07.880
 edges and then you put the sausage 

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:07.880
 step up and roll up 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.939
 that's how you get to know all the sausages 

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:29.549
 while you set the oven to 200 degrees 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:31.590
 upper and lower heat before you can 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.790
 the sausages in the dressing gown once before 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.830
 brush with water 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.340
 Of course that does not mean the sausages 

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:39.570
 but only the puff pastry 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:44.909
 You can also take a gag then 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:47.009
 they become a bit darker but what 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:54.300
 It also makes it nice and crispy 

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:56.759
 when all will finish him 

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:58.920
 and the oven has reached its 200 degrees 

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:01.049
 put her the baking tray on the 

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:02.460
 middle rail of the oven and after 

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.840
 about twenty minutes 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.530
 I have to watch that they are not too brown 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:09.569
 they will be finished when the 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.450
 sausages in a dressing gown have accepted 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:21.299
 have to take about 20 minutes 

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:23.360
 she pops something up and does it 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:26.390
 they could previously cut 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:29.600
 but I do not find that disturbing 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:33.540
 so we can add a salad to it 

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:33.930
 Serve or something else as well 

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.000
 pure 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.190
 they taste very delicious or maybe 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.280
 a little more ketchup or must be good 

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:40.280
 appetite
