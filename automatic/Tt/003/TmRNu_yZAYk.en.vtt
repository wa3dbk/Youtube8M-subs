00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.910
 The sweater is a guide extension 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:07.770
 of the veste of that you should 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.800
 first look at the instructions to better 

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:13.740
 and the vest ready cherish then make 

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.310
 we continue with the heirs as well 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:24.900
 electrify with the save means 

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:25.849
 this color 2352 and with a 45 mm 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.710
 to have 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:32.340
 everything we still have to do with politics 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:36.270
 of course, the sleeves and and the 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:42.120
 the front of the hood rises and 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:45.329
 I already knotted the yarn and 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:49.649
 Although at the point where the axis is so 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:51.420
 just pull through 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:01:00.500
 Now I'm going through the same again 

00:00:51.420 --> 00:01:03.770
 mesh through us here a stitch high 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:03.770
 an air 

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:15.100
 the short is missing what I mean by the way 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:21.399
 run away so they disappear with 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:21.399
 and we continue crocheting in tight stitches 

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:30.469
 we can put the sleeves in spittal and 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:31.659
 Laying or finished him complete the 

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:36.369
 it does not matter 

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:36.369
 you should never spiral around here, no 

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:41.810
 make a marker 

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:44.349
 here you are the place again 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.349
 finds 

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.090
 and I would have a round now 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.620
 moor 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:02:00.550
 We'll meet you back at so 

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:02.860
 start round when you first round 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:04.960
 crochet for the sleeve you should calmly 

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:07.870
 use both tabs of one stitch 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:10.570
 So that means under both wash the 

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:13.270
 again he will give me a good one 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:15.940
 haid did on the second round 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:18.550
 again pass over only through the 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:21.300
 crochet front tab or just the one 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:23.890
 take front flap 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:26.620
 the first round was now over 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:30.160
 'm going to close it, the 

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:33.040
 First time seems to close the whole 

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:36.400
 Winter knows mesh and the work will 

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:37.750
 I now therefore apply those approaching to 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.209
 this place will not be with you 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:41.380
 usually walks when crocheting 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:43.180
 but still that with me 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:47.320
 At least when you are in that direction if 

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:50.530
 I continue to crochet in rounds and yourself 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:53.110
 Here I turn the work begins 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:55.510
 again with an air mesh and here 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:58.180
 click again in fixed stitches 

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:59.530
 back what we are now in the 2 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:08.560
 still we start with one 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:10.810
 So I go where I am the more serious 

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.880
 mesh by the demand germany 

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:16.060
 she can tell me that what she likes so much 

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:17.320
 through the next this can be done by and 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.200
 that too, and then I pull 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:24.940
 through all three corpses through that results 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:27.130
 an art and then have a day 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.320
 wash firmly only through the front 

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:33.120
 Clear 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:33.120
 the complete round finished 

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:40.420
 we meet again at the round 

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:43.830
 arrived at the end of the round 

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:43.830
 Let's close the round again 

00:03:52.710 --> 00:04:05.630
 then an air mass and back into the 

00:03:55.050 --> 00:04:09.710
 Work and crochet in tight stitches 

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:18.210
 the complete round around 

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:22.110
 this time without loss that is we have 

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:23.700
 always a round with a decrease and a 

00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:27.240
 round without decrease 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:29.580
 that makes the sleeve a little bit 

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:31.740
 Of course, the sleeve should be narrower 

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:35.750
 early before you get the whole 

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:38.130
 have leveraged length already be close enough 

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:40.440
 then , of course, with the decreases 

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:42.510
 then we crochet now in solid 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:45.540
 mesh depending on whether now spiral 

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:48.060
 wanted or have chosen closed 

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:49.920
 but the sky with the dues already 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:51.330
 should look at it early then 

00:04:49.920 --> 00:04:51.930
 s.besten try as you see then 

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:53.820
 even better 

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:57.350
 or if you have a pattern 

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:57.350
 Of course you can stick to it 

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:04.980
 yes and then we'll meet again if 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:07.560
 we want to start with the covenant 

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:09.810
 So not the full length of the rb 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:13.290
 chop finished but a little bit more 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:14.730
 leave space for the cuff if the 

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:17.220
 arms are long enough you can 

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:19.830
 Looking temporary cuff and 

00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:21.530
 that here we can just like me here 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:28.900
 below 

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:31.160
 We start with a sore chopsticks 

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:33.050
 you can start with, for example 

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:36.200
 I want two or three air 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:41.150
 start in two correct jobs so that 

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:49.130
 I would have looked at the outer side 

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:53.050
 the whole round only in chopsticks and you 

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:53.050
 fifth mesh I will lose weight 

00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:59.090
 then every fifth say something 

00:05:56.090 --> 00:06:05.090
 cheap to the heart 5 the first air 

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:07.390
 mercedes 1 so 12345 and then the 

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:07.390
 order 

00:06:17.409 --> 00:06:25.110
 so convenient the two together 

00:06:20.199 --> 00:06:25.110
 differ and then count again 

00:06:26.729 --> 00:06:29.729
 12 

00:06:44.320 --> 00:06:46.590
 here 

00:06:47.439 --> 00:07:03.770
 and then again the decrease we see 

00:06:54.500 --> 00:07:05.889
 us again in dogs beginning in the 

00:07:03.770 --> 00:07:11.770
 round is done 

00:07:05.889 --> 00:07:17.180
 we close it knows basic machine 

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:21.830
 and then we start again with two 

00:07:17.180 --> 00:07:24.520
 air masses and a change 1 rule 

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:24.520
 rod 

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:31.050
 bargain 

00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:35.560
 make others 

00:07:37.639 --> 00:07:43.099
 chopsticks and so on, so we did that 

00:07:40.159 --> 00:07:47.949
 actually already from the bottom 

00:07:43.099 --> 00:07:50.990
 We are used to that too often 

00:07:47.949 --> 00:07:53.180
 round in completed rounds he is 

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:54.830
 rather now completely finished off 

00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:56.659
 you do not need the second round 

00:07:54.830 --> 00:07:57.849
 Decreases to do more you can do it 

00:07:56.659 --> 00:08:00.259
 but if you want 

00:07:57.849 --> 00:08:02.150
 he looks more like this when he finishes 

00:08:00.259 --> 00:08:03.830
 is and the other sleeve we do 

00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:06.379
 of course , and then as you do 

00:08:03.830 --> 00:08:08.770
 do not forget the sweater 

00:08:06.379 --> 00:08:12.169
 to earn whole loose ends 

00:08:08.770 --> 00:08:15.080
 yes I hope the instructions are helpful 

00:08:12.169 --> 00:08:17.439
 for you and have fun until the 

00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:17.439
 next time
