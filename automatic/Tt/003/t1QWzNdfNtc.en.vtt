00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:20.820
If you could choose to go anywhere

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:28.200
Just close your eyes and imagine

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:40.900
The world belongs to just you and I if I could be there with you

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:53.640
If any road was one we could take

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:00.900
And any place could be ours

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:09.020
We make the choice, we leave here today and

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:13.580
I could be there with you

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:22.580
If I'm where you are, nowhere's too far

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.120
So take me with you

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:35.260
All I need is you

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:44.560
We go and when we come back again

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:51.860
Everything seems like it's new then

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:59.860
On rainy nights, tell me the story

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:04.680
When I was there with you

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:13.480
If I am where you are, nowhere's too far

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.940
So take me with you

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:29.340
All I need is you

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:30.080

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.300
Someday, someway

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.760
I will be there with you

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:53.600
If you could choose to go anywhere

00:02:55.180 --> 00:03:01.080
Just close your eyes and imagine

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:13.720
The world belongs to just you and I if I could be there with you

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.900
I could be there with you
