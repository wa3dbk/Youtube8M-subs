00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:02.366
- YOU'RE A HUGE ANIMAL LOVER,
AS AM I,

00:00:02.366 --> 00:00:04.800
AND YOU LOVE
TO RESCUE ANIMALS.

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.300
- MM-HMM.

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.700
- YOU ALMOST RESCUED AN ANIMAL
THAT DIDN'T WANT TO BE RESCUED.

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:09.833
- I DID.
I ONCE CHASED--

00:00:09.833 --> 00:00:11.400
I ONCE MISSED
THREE PERIODS OF SCHOOL

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.500
CHASING A CAT
THROUGH MY NEIGHBORHOOD

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.300
UNDER FENCES,
INTO PEOPLE'S BACKYARDS,

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:19.300
TILL IT BECAME REALLY CLEAR
THAT THE CAT WAS, LIKE,

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:21.366
TOTALLY ENJOYING ITS LIFE
WITHOUT ME...

00:00:21.366 --> 00:00:22.500
- UH-HUH.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.666
- AND DID NOT NEED
TO COME HOME WITH ME,

00:00:24.666 --> 00:00:26.633
BUT, YOU KNOW, I--
WE HAVE ONE DOG,

00:00:26.633 --> 00:00:28.333
MY BOYFRIEND AND ME,
WHO'S A RESCUE DOG.

00:00:28.333 --> 00:00:30.400
HIS NAME'S LAMBY.
HE'S A VERY ECCENTRIC GUY.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.800
- LAMBY.
- LAMBY.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.000
- LOOK AT LAMBY.
- HE'S SO CUTE.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.066
THAT'S THE OTHER DAY.

00:00:37.066 --> 00:00:38.433
I HAD A REST DAY
FROM MY BOOK TOUR,

00:00:38.433 --> 00:00:40.933
AND WE LITERALLY DID THAT
FOR THE ENTIRE DAY.

00:00:40.933 --> 00:00:43.966
THAT'S JUST--THAT'S JUST
THE KIND OF LOVE WE SHARE.

00:00:43.966 --> 00:00:45.066
- THAT'S ADORABLE.

00:00:45.066 --> 00:00:47.800
- BUT I REALLY WANT
MORE DOGS AND--

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.900
I WANT A HAIRLESS CAT.
- MM-HMM.

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:51.700
- I GREW UP WITH HAIRLESS CATS,
AND I WANT MORE.

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:52.733
AND I ALSO WANT A--

00:00:52.733 --> 00:00:54.033
- YOU GREW UP
WITH HAIRLESS CATS?

00:00:54.033 --> 00:00:55.866
- I HAD FOUR OF THEM.
- WOW.

00:00:55.866 --> 00:00:58.100
- BECAUSE MY MOM
WAS ALLERGIC.

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.366
- PORTIA WANTS A HAIRLESS CAT.
THEY'RE WEIRD-LOOKING.

00:01:00.366 --> 00:01:01.866
- THEY'RE REALLY
WEIRD-LOOKING.

00:01:01.866 --> 00:01:03.133
THEY HAVE SOME HEALTH ISSUES

00:01:03.133 --> 00:01:04.600
BECAUSE THERE'S,
LIKE, FOUR OF THEM,

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.200
AND THEY'RE ALL
SLEEPING TOGETHER,

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.066
SO IT'S--
THEY'RE INBRED.

00:01:09.066 --> 00:01:10.966
THEY'RE REALLY INBRED.

00:01:10.966 --> 00:01:13.233
- ALL HAIRLESS CATS
ARE INBRED?

00:01:13.233 --> 00:01:15.200
- I DON'T WANT TO MAKE
BLANKET STATEMENTS

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.200
THAT ARE GONNA OFFEND

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.833
THE HAIRLESS CAT
COMMUNITY, BUT...

00:01:17.833 --> 00:01:19.700
- WELL, YOU JUST DID.

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.200
YOU CAN'T SAY THAT THERE'S ONLY
FOUR HAIRLESS CATS

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.233
IN THE WHOLE WORLD

00:01:23.233 --> 00:01:24.666
AND THEY'RE ALL
SLEEPING TOGETHER.

00:01:24.666 --> 00:01:26.800
[laughter]

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.033
- I MEAN--
HERE'S WHAT I'LL SAY.

00:01:28.033 --> 00:01:29.666
I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE
A HAIRLESS CAT.

00:01:29.666 --> 00:01:32.200
THEY--HAIRLESS CATS
ARE SUCH A SPECIALIZED THING

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:33.800
THAT THEY'RE ONLY AVAILABLE
FOR RESCUE,

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.000
LIKE, ONCE EVERY NINE YEARS,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.533
SO IF YOU SEE ONE,
YOU SHOULD JUMP AT IT.

00:01:36.533 --> 00:01:38.033
- RIGHT, RIGHT.

00:01:38.033 --> 00:01:40.300
AND THEY'RE HARD TO RESCUE,
AND YOU WANT TO RESCUE, RIGHT?

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:41.333
- YEAH, I WANT TO RESCUE.

00:01:41.333 --> 00:01:42.800
- BUT WHAT ELSE
DO YOU WANT TO RESCUE?

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.833
'CAUSE DIDN'T YOU TEXT
YOUR BOYFRIEND--

00:01:44.833 --> 00:01:48.600
WHO, BY THE WAY, IS THE FABULOUS
JACK ANTONOFF FROM FUN,

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.900
FROM THE BAND FUN.

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:53.000
SO WHAT--
WHAT DID YOU WANT TO--

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.000
WHAT ELSE--

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.400
- OH, THERE HE IS.
- THERE HE IS.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.233
- I TEXTED HIM
THAT I WANT--

00:01:57.233 --> 00:01:59.800
I THINK I SAID,
"I WANT TWO PUPPIES,

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.366
"A POTBELLY PIG, A HAIRLESS CAT,
AND ANOTHER PUPPY,

00:02:03.366 --> 00:02:04.900
"AND IF I CAN'T HAVE THEM ALL
RIGHT NOW,

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:05.966
I'M GOING TO DIE."

00:02:05.966 --> 00:02:07.233
- WOW.

00:02:07.233 --> 00:02:08.766
- AND HE WROTE BACK,

00:02:08.766 --> 00:02:10.933
"CAN WE TALK ABOUT THIS
WHEN I GET HOME,

00:02:10.933 --> 00:02:13.266
OR DOES IT HAVE TO BE HANDLED
RIGHT NOW?"

00:02:13.266 --> 00:02:15.200
- THAT'S A VERY
UNDERSTANDING BOYFRIEND,

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.433
'CAUSE THAT WAS A VERY
DRAMATIC WAY TO PHRASE THAT.

00:02:17.433 --> 00:02:19.000
- I KNOW.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.233
DO YOU--DO YOU--
HOW MANY ANIMALS DO YOU HAVE?

00:02:22.233 --> 00:02:23.233
- WE HAVE SIX.

00:02:23.233 --> 00:02:24.633
WE HAVE THREE DOGS
AND THREE CATS.

00:02:24.633 --> 00:02:26.833
- SO NICE.
- AND I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE MORE.

00:02:26.833 --> 00:02:29.600
I'D LOVE TO HAVE AS MANY ANIMALS
AS I COULD POSSIBLY--

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.566
BUT RIGHT NOW, I THINK THAT'S--
WE HAVE OUR HANDS FULL.

00:02:32.566 --> 00:02:36.400
- LAST WEEK, I WAS FEELING
SORT OF, LIKE, EXHAUSTED,

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.133
A LITTLE DEPRESSED
AND SELF-INDULGENT,

00:02:38.133 --> 00:02:39.266
AND I SAID
TO MY BOYFRIEND,

00:02:39.266 --> 00:02:40.700
"WHAT'S THE POINT
OF WORKING SO HARD

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.866
IF YOU CAN'T HAVE MILLIONS
OF PUPPIES?"

00:02:43.866 --> 00:02:45.933
[laughter]

00:02:45.933 --> 00:02:47.033
- WOW.

00:02:47.033 --> 00:02:48.600
WAS YOUR HAND LIKE THAT
WHEN YOU SAID IT?

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.400
- BASICALLY.
ALL CURLED UP.

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.800
- IT SOUNDS VERY--
- DESPONDENT.

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.000
- I HAVE--I HAVE A GIFT.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.700
ON THE SHOW, YOU'RE ALWAYS
WEARING ONESIES,

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.300
WHICH I LOVE,
AND WE SELL ONESIES

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:58.333
HERE IN THE ELLEN SHOP.

00:02:58.333 --> 00:02:59.333
- YOU DO?

00:02:59.333 --> 00:03:00.433
- WE HAVE FOR A LONG TIME,

00:03:00.433 --> 00:03:01.833
BECAUSE I THINK
THEY'RE FABULOUS.

00:03:01.833 --> 00:03:03.433
I LOVE ONESIES.
- ONESIES ARE MY PASSION.

00:03:03.433 --> 00:03:05.666
- AND MINE TOO.
- LAMBY HAS A ONESIE.

00:03:05.666 --> 00:03:07.100
- LAMBY HAS A ONESIE?
- TWO.

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:08.600
ONE HAS RABBIT EARS,
AND ONE DOESN'T.

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.100
- I WISH
I WOULD'VE KNOWN THAT.

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.100
WE DIDN'T GET ANYTHING FOR--
BUT WE GOT SOMETHING FOR YOU,

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:14.166
AND IT HAS ALL--

00:03:14.166 --> 00:03:15.733
- NO!

00:03:15.733 --> 00:03:17.233
[cheers and applause]

00:03:17.233 --> 00:03:21.800
- IT HAS A PIG, A PUPPY,
A RABBIT, AND ME.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.933
- AND LAMBY.
- YEAH.

00:03:24.933 --> 00:03:27.666
- ELLEN,
THANK YOU.

00:03:27.666 --> 00:03:29.033
I'M NOT EXAGGERATING.

00:03:29.033 --> 00:03:31.500
THIS IS THE BEST PRESENT
I'VE EVER GOTTEN.

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.066
- I'M SO GLAD.
IT'S YOURS.
