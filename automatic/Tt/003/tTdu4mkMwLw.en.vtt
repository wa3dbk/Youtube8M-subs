00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:04.220
 digital cable tv and windows media center that they are not the cheese best 

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:07.279
 friends have had it very often and he had possibly before and was one 

00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:09.799
 solution then the flop idtv 

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:14.659
 the product from one to about manufacturers and not one behind me 

00:00:14.659 --> 00:00:19.020
 deficit this bin said sjorders vocally i just pretend that this area is this 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.910
 technology that counts for that and then it appears the media center after the latter 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:26.689
 Their order was separate because he did not work the PC internally via York 

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:30.390
 connected to additional bull cards per se that ditch in vianen 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:34.280
 warioware connection actually on your PC but it works like that 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.180
 For a long time, however, the only solution to have digital cable TV has been the 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:39.110
 viewers off 

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:41.600
 that is not about a horde of fans still 

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.500
 the third-to-a-few months ago, small businesses that took the risks 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.829
 The indication of the one year stop is a true manufacturer of the garage of the 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:50.129
 side of the top idea 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:53.289
 but also go for it thanks to the crisis and I want it all 

00:00:53.289 --> 00:00:57.139
 nothing was sold to keep a lot of businesses and therefore healthy 

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:58.650
 she pulled the plug 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:02.200
 And it seemed that there were difficult solutions such as digital cable TV 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.989
 a co-suspicious look 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:07.460
 maarten almost really got a share of the 

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.970
 the zero as importer in love with idtv hangover van van je this is a pedal of 

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.330
 we have another solution and that is namely the boxes of it 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.230
 Korean brand and chili 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:19.990
 and that's okay i agree with you that is a complete tuning exactly 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.010
 via usb reason that's it right away 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:23.720
 and immediately a big difference 

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.850
 with the flop idtv cards 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.090
 He is also external to that increase due to an external from Jan that there is a hefty one 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.940
 buyer interest calculate exactly 

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.940
 this is just such a type of small thing so immediately and 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.820
 the n va well received and is therefore not only incur additional costs yes let's 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:40.750
 then also abolish it 

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:42.900
 in a bag and drops 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:47.760
 The beauty of this product, however, is the power for digital TV that is possible 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:48.110
 here 

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:52.470
 directly in the plus if your pc google launches what critics work of course 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.540
 often never book there but never good to say because they do 

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:59.020
 the entire story of media from poetic to digital tv media center 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.010
 always a media center if you have eyelashes it is a nice time to make it through 

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:04.770
 stephan it's just not going to work exactly and that's that usually has 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:06.890
 margot digital TV conflicts 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.379
 which totally managed on the computer of joepie cynically for a notebook 

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:14.030
 There is a risk that machangulo almers would leave the cart like that 

00:02:14.029 --> 00:02:16.510
 but you know where it is but you can only get the par for the plus 

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.419
 package are exactly collapsed well b the voc replica to sit the power always 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:26.379
 I can close Bruno already wrong after he has often found that it is only possible 

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:30.980
 mobile costs under 20 euros and the costs that the flop idtv kate itself 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.569
 also another 150 euros 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:35.809
 the friezin so gives in this direction the 300 euros in you could start 

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:41.599
 MSC receivers that sits in the oil card reader industry can use the smart card very much 

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:43.319
 to stop immediately 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:45.789
 de and you have done everything to get started 

00:02:45.789 --> 00:02:47.730
 before clarity one 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:50.960
 This is a minister to come and make more so you will have to happen 

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:53.440
 what is already underway that has little to do with this, it is a dust comb 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:54.020
 and 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:58.029
 so it is very common in those days that I also have protocol 

00:02:58.029 --> 00:03:01.879
 Therefore the players and the board's data can think the aex 

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:06.069
 NX drops opportunities. In normal set-top boxes such as those who order here 

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:09.669
 have TV that the death toll can still be substantial 

00:03:09.669 --> 00:03:12.999
 she visited differently or comically a lot cheaper to make 

00:03:12.999 --> 00:03:17.259
 and according to oskam is also until then city that says the other manufacturer and I see 

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:18.479
 that is very common 

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:24.149
 a the fabric made about this is so if you dream that i can ever adjust 

00:03:24.149 --> 00:03:28.129
 his says on it says on that adaptation and dropped of this new movie 

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:31.589
 actually when you get out and then then you should be able to watch 

00:03:31.589 --> 00:03:34.249
 He also has that installation is ever very complicated 

00:03:34.249 --> 00:03:38.669
 yes it is if you have to go there the money that you do as some paint on idtv before 

00:03:38.669 --> 00:03:43.279
 did Karen duys this device occurs with a special train effect as being 

00:03:43.279 --> 00:03:45.809
 and receive a DVD 

00:03:45.809 --> 00:03:50.119
 it makes it is otherwise the installation says in pieces the talk 

00:03:50.119 --> 00:03:53.569
 then at the flop idtv cards because what was always the case there 

00:03:53.569 --> 00:03:57.069
 read here the media center that once to get started searching the bike was against it 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:03:57.990
 come 

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:02.200
 for being measured 12 50 or more have gone radio live i can and i like it 

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.870
 whole work and you will find it at the forefront 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:08.360
 counting in the ruined spectrum for the murder of the cable is a nasty one 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:12.370
 are right in children's language nice good order year is absolute sense in that sense 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:15.599
 in the latest version of the van meerssen up to windows 7 a whole can be done 

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:18.880
 much faster than the years before, you had to dance the versions of the past 

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.539
 but if you have one if you are a channel from it 

00:04:20.539 --> 00:04:24.339
 number three below bougherra the possibility year that was 95 times 

00:04:24.339 --> 00:04:26.899
 no more pressing a button against the light already entering to it stays 

00:04:26.899 --> 00:04:27.960
 participate for the time being 

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:32.240
 the next installment of bonding is the so-called maybe jal it looks like it 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.120
 that looks a bit too good and that is a normal set-top box 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:38.020
 used rutte mainly sees who there is being that his grandfather 

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:41.539
 that can now go a bit bad within ten minutes, the media center sees 

00:04:41.539 --> 00:04:44.060
 speed have it here it is different 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:47.169
 I have a very nice words Zeeland one two and three in the beginning 

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:50.110
 rtl4 rtl5 sbs6 and so on 

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:52.919
 there you are immediately also it is not just one that one two three snow 

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:56.210
 in venray hd so there is also a few weeks much of the meantime suitable 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:58.710
 for her 2 6 4 the king yes that is the cake 

00:04:58.710 --> 00:05:02.410
 you do not yet have the great advantage of a medical center in the 7 

00:05:02.410 --> 00:05:06.120
 suitable for HD TV to put 107 late had fishermen fourth 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.539
 So there is support for HD channels 

00:05:08.539 --> 00:05:13.009
 the codex with this so even sit therefore also suitable because the video card 

00:05:13.009 --> 00:05:16.009
 so I try no more problems with exactly ten years ago 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:19.589
 he dropped and you see then there is also 

00:05:19.589 --> 00:05:22.869
 Employers choose between those made HD channels work great gun idea 

00:05:22.869 --> 00:05:25.659
 players boasted adede tail gets such 

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:29.639
 if power needs power and you can see here that it runs like one 

00:05:29.639 --> 00:05:34.590
 train in the minus 4 in windows 7 media center than so there is a lot to come 

00:05:34.589 --> 00:05:38.180
 say that everyone is themselves that is say but not just a logical one 

00:05:38.179 --> 00:05:42.419
 successor to an improvement on the paper newspaper yes and above all 

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:46.830
 is a lot cheaper to pay for this box 149 euros in addition 

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:47.580
 must be ready 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:50.469
 studio 100 meters turnout last in the bite 

00:05:50.469 --> 00:05:54.270
 and what i said letter to you this is a good way it was the map for the region 

00:05:54.269 --> 00:05:57.919
 Researchers found they are in the euro zone almost off the job 

00:05:57.919 --> 00:06:01.470
 although many have a tuner about this you can connect two traden 

00:06:01.469 --> 00:06:04.840
 galatasaray means if you are multiple then that's why a channel becomes 

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:07.449
 to be able to watch with some to record then i have as one 

00:06:07.449 --> 00:06:10.229
 second ticket with the winter is easier to compete against sparta 

00:06:10.229 --> 00:06:12.030
 accountants become ecoclubs 

00:06:12.030 --> 00:06:15.000
 less difficult about you can just class but today against my head 

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.569
 set per household 

00:06:16.569 --> 00:06:20.719
 but I at least for a part of the time amount and a great working and 

00:06:20.719 --> 00:06:21.520
 media center 

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:24.520
 the ball was from windows 7 with a mission 

00:06:26.439 --> 00:06:30.519
 and if this week lots of hd tv news from the hilversummer de winne annual 

00:06:30.519 --> 00:06:34.409
 had held Breda after a bit of a party where all the effects are already tasting 

00:06:34.409 --> 00:06:35.759
 leaders and broadcasters
