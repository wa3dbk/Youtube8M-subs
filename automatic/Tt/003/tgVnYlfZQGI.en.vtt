00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
I got me thinking why do we even have

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.299 
I got me thinking why do we even have
traffic<00:01:00.780> in<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.140> first<00:01:01.379> place<00:01:01.530> of<00:01:01.739> every<00:01:02.070> car

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309

00:01:05.119 --> 00:01:05.129 
on the road was moving and then getting

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:06.320 
on the road was moving and then getting
off<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.489> frame<00:01:05.640> and<00:01:05.790> they're<00:01:05.909> supposed<00:01:06.210> to

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
off the frame and they're supposed to

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.780 
off the frame and they're supposed to
shouldn't<00:01:06.990> all<00:01:07.170> the<00:01:07.350> cars<00:01:07.590> be<00:01:07.830> moving<00:01:08.250> forward

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
shouldn't all the cars be moving forward
