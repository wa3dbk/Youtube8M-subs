00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:50.380 
just a little lower but from the way of

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.219 
just a little lower but from the way of
playing<00:01:51.380> at<00:01:51.800> the<00:01:52.250> technique<00:01:52.840> you<00:01:53.840> feel<00:01:54.080> at

home immediately because if you listen
to<00:01:57.410> the<00:01:57.650> middle<00:01:57.920> register<00:01:58.240> it's<00:01:59.240> very

00:01:59.650 --> 00:01:59.660 
to the middle register it's very

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:01.780

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:15.290 
gets that kind of nasty nasal sound this

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.130 
gets that kind of nasty nasal sound this
sounds<00:02:15.980> the<00:02:16.130> sound<00:02:16.489> of<00:02:16.640> this<00:02:16.820> flute<00:02:17.180> stays
