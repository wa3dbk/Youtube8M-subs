00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
 and then guys all beauty who speaks 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:06.240
 launch a second mathematical channel in the 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.830
 real life bringing you 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.139
 the resolution of the 1st qualification examination 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.780
 da uerj 2016 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:16.289
 the question of number 27 let's say 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:18.480
 thus an inflation index of 25% in 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:21.810
 determined period of time indicates that 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.560
 on average prices rose 25% in this 

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:24.660
 period 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.180
 a worker who could previously buy 

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.220
 a number of products with the 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.529
 inflation and are wage increases and without 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.930
 you can only buy now 

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:37.590
 an amount of the same products 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.000
 being y smaller than pee with inflation 

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.920
 of 25% 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.010
 loss of purchasing power 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.350
 worker is from here is a matter of 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.649
 percentage if the rule of three 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:51.629
 this is theoretically a question of a 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.980
 simple concept but the one advertised is 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:55.920
 quite jammed 

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:58.140
 so it's an issue you can is 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.609
 stay behind the parade in some time 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.620
 frozen in time 

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:04.170
 It's a well-solved song with lots of 

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.920
 attention if you read and reread it with much 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.330
 attention 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.250
 Can you understand what he wants? 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.610
 say look what he is saying 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.200
 He says that you bought is a 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.070
 quantity x of products it goes 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.220
 decrease 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.920
 As you only have percentages here, I 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:23.549
 I always speak with all the videos I say 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.950
 you see not only percentages you 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.689
 you can assign values because 

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:29.670
 for a percentage goes for any 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:32.189
 value following the 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:35.759
 So I'll say so let's say a 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:39.720
 worker he received 100 reais a 

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:41.159
 value of 100 and he could buy a 

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:45.360
 quantity of products 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:46.439
 certain product or product that was 100 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.270
 real 

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.280
 only now that product has had a 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.439
 increase of 25% 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:57.540
 it does not cost you more than a hundred dollars it costs 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:59.640
 now R $ 125 25% of 100 reais and twenty 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.390
 five reais you want to make the rule of 

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.329
 three 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.500
 but the worker keeps on winning 

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:06.780
 100 reais 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.209
 after all the disk question without increase 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:13.210
 salary right there you will think the 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:16.090
 next with 100 reais 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:16.960
 for 100% of the product that cost 100 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:19.870
 real 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:22.420
 now with 100 reais he can not 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:24.130
 more buy 100% of the product it 

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.380
 can only buy a percentage 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.570
 of this product a part of that product 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:32.950
 but what part is this? 

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:37.930
 the whole product costs 125 to 125 

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:38.710
 Real is 100% right product 100 

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.570
 real 

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:41.890
 he can buy how many percent 

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:44.050
 of this product 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:46.000
 ok he can not get the whole product but 

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:47.620
 he gets a share then the 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:55.900
 multiplying crossed here will stay the 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:03:01.150
 that 125 x is equal to 10 thousand x will be 10 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:05.560
 thousand over 125 you discover that x is 

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:08.830
 equal to 80% beauty but do not fret 

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:10.240
 because he did not ask how much 

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:13.840
 he can buy 

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:15.010
 he asked the power to lose power 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:18.490
 purchase 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:21.910
 he bought 100% and now he can 

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:25.420
 buy 80% ie he had a loss 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:27.630
 of purchasing power of 20% then the 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.790
 alternative correct alternative ' 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:32.200
 Calm down, you understood the point. 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:33.970
 anything any doubt bet 

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.920
 in the comments you already know 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:39.990
 if you like the video you subscribe to 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.990
