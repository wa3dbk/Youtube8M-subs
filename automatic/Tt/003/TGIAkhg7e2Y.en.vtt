more feminine where's their the extra is
maybe<00:00:47.070> more<00:00:47.160> masculine<00:00:47.820> I<00:00:48.090> think<00:00:48.390> exonic

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.050 
maybe more masculine I think exonic

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.209 
maybe more masculine I think exonic
gazelle<00:00:49.469> maker<00:00:50.840> but<00:00:51.840> it's<00:00:51.960> got<00:00:52.140> some<00:00:52.410> females

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
gazelle maker but it's got some females

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:56.660 
gazelle maker but it's got some females
that<00:00:53.280> it's<00:00:53.879> a<00:00:54.000> very<00:00:54.870> female<00:00:55.410> how<00:00:55.680> I<00:00:55.710> think<00:00:56.160> for

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
that it's a very female how I think for

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.459 
that it's a very female how I think for
younger<00:00:56.879> people<00:00:57.120> generation<00:00:57.840> generation

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
younger people generation generation

younger people generation generation
active<00:00:59.280> people<00:00:59.489> the<00:01:00.059> shape<00:01:00.300> it's<00:01:00.510> still<00:01:00.840> kind

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
active people the shape it's still kind

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:04.219 
active people the shape it's still kind
of<00:01:01.379> bulky<00:01:01.680> so<00:01:02.550> I<00:01:02.879> think<00:01:02.940> even<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:03.600> men<00:01:03.809> will

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
of bulky so I think even the men will

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:07.550 
of bulky so I think even the men will
like<00:01:04.619> it<00:01:04.890> our<00:01:05.430> idea<00:01:05.939> was<00:01:06.030> to<00:01:06.540> go<00:01:06.720> away<00:01:07.020> from<00:01:07.439> a

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
like it our idea was to go away from a

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.670 
like it our idea was to go away from a
conventional<00:01:07.950> SUV<00:01:08.909> because<00:01:09.659> people<00:01:09.720> have<00:01:10.470> in

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:10.680 
conventional SUV because people have in

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.580 
conventional SUV because people have in
mind<00:01:10.950> a<00:01:11.159> more<00:01:11.340> personal<00:01:11.909> car<00:01:12.210> it's<00:01:12.750> account

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
mind a more personal car it's account

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.370 
mind a more personal car it's account
for<00:01:13.770> everybody<00:01:14.189> it's<00:01:14.790> a<00:01:15.030> new<00:01:15.360> expression<00:01:15.930> of

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:16.380 
for everybody it's a new expression of

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.980 
for everybody it's a new expression of
SUV<00:01:17.070> which<00:01:17.400> means<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:17.970> double<00:01:18.390> set<00:01:18.570> shoulder

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
SUV which means the double set shoulder

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:24.600 
very sleek greenhouse area and that's

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:25.490 
very sleek greenhouse area and that's
something<00:01:24.780> that<00:01:24.930> you<00:01:25.080> see<00:01:25.200> only<00:01:25.350> on

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
something that you see only on

high-performance sports cars dynamic

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.289 
high-performance sports cars dynamic
proportions<00:01:28.740> so<00:01:28.950> the<00:01:29.070> car<00:01:29.340> is<00:01:29.369> not<00:01:29.820> a<00:01:29.880> static

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
proportions so the car is not a static

proportions so the car is not a static
object<00:01:30.659> it<00:01:31.200> moves<00:01:31.530> and<00:01:32.360> sculptural<00:01:33.360> is<00:01:33.720> our

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
approach to the surfacing dynamics

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.740 
approach to the surfacing dynamics
capture<00:01:37.470> means<00:01:37.680> negative<00:01:38.520> positive<00:01:39.060> surface

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
capture means negative positive surface

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.080 
capture means negative positive surface
is<00:01:40.020> coming<00:01:40.380> together<00:01:40.530> creating<00:01:41.490> tension<00:01:42.000> in

is coming together creating tension in
between<00:01:42.420> which<00:01:42.960> is<00:01:42.990> a<00:01:43.140> unique<00:01:43.590> approach<00:01:43.740> in

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
between which is a unique approach in

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.429 
between which is a unique approach in
the<00:01:44.220> category<00:01:44.700> of<00:01:44.820> a<00:01:45.119> compact<00:01:45.479> SUV<00:01:45.930> if<00:01:46.140> you

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
the category of a compact SUV if you

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:49.580 
the category of a compact SUV if you
look<00:01:46.680> at<00:01:46.890> the<00:01:47.189> rear<00:01:47.790> of<00:01:47.880> the<00:01:48.030> car<00:01:48.479> we<00:01:49.110> use<00:01:49.380> very

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
look at the rear of the car we use very

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.310 
look at the rear of the car we use very
innovative<00:01:50.270> materials<00:01:51.270> of<00:01:51.509> the<00:01:51.659> rear<00:01:51.869> window

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
innovative materials of the rear window

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.920 
innovative materials of the rear window
which<00:01:52.950> allows<00:01:53.340> us<00:01:53.670> to<00:01:53.939> create<00:01:54.119> a<00:01:54.270> much<00:01:54.630> more

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:54.930 
which allows us to create a much more

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.800 
which allows us to create a much more
three-dimensional<00:01:55.890> shape<00:01:56.219> then<00:01:56.969> it<00:01:57.299> would<00:01:57.540> be

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
three-dimensional shape then it would be

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.800 
three-dimensional shape then it would be
using<00:01:58.770> conventional<00:01:59.130> class<00:01:59.820> you<00:02:00.600> and<00:02:00.719> I

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
using conventional class you and I

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.260 
using conventional class you and I
doesn't<00:02:01.229> have<00:02:01.259> the<00:02:01.649> history<00:02:02.189> of<00:02:02.280> other<00:02:02.820> well

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
doesn't have the history of other well

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.090 
doesn't have the history of other well
established<00:02:03.960> brands<00:02:04.409> in<00:02:04.560> Europe<00:02:04.920> and

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
established brands in Europe and

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.789 
established brands in Europe and
therefore<00:02:06.000> we<00:02:06.240> have<00:02:06.270> the<00:02:06.540> chance<00:02:06.810> to<00:02:07.020> head

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:07.799 
therefore we have the chance to head

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:11.150 
therefore we have the chance to head
more<00:02:08.190> to<00:02:08.399> the<00:02:08.520> future<00:02:09.000> and<00:02:09.209> this<00:02:09.959> gives<00:02:10.229> us

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
more to the future and this gives us
