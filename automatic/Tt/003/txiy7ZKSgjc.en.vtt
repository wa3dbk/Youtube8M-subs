00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.240
 carrier because the weight of the pilot will be fundamental this year 

00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:05.880
 giorgio explains piola why 

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:09.730
 yes, because with the third of which takes away over 30 civilians and 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:14.400
 the important thing is that the pilot gets to the minimum of his possible weight to be able to 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:19.229
 mount more ballast because then total weight must always be 605 tv 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:23.560
 the right tension for this felipe massa debut 

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.050
 that goes up but that we said ros me2 fundamental in that season 

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:33.060
 difficult the past of caressed this f60 the new steering wheel difficult 

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.390
 because if it is played to the end here we see 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:39.180
 the new lante should be positioned in the upper right corner 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:42.890
 second in the pilot community the vote of the cheers 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.890
 yes of course verdena sei namorar 

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:53.270
 trust we are genialloyd with the n 73 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.870
 good the camera. 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.490
 commentary let me enjoy a man 

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.490
 unipol volume bank and we go with remote control 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.850
 about this 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.920
 where he lives in the neutral zone 

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.820
 of the deflectors that sprouted instead now you see it completely video 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.849
 sometimes you see the side mirror that mounted on those 

00:02:11.849 --> 00:02:14.809
 brand new revolutionary film 

00:02:14.809 --> 00:02:18.299
 I have become must have just that you say areodinamica 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:21.540
 return box interesting to see it because why 

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.200
 and now you will see that the mechanics do not immediately approach the machine there 

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.920
 machine comes back because there is this that goes along with it 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.140
 the batteries there is the danger risk of the shock comes the engineers pilot 

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:37.260
 mechanics immediately put my hands on the machine but now they have to wait 

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:42.110
 locke and must be sure to be able to approach the car look and then 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.510
 the okay comes when the mechanics can get their hands on 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:46.989
 u 

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:50.459
 I can tell you a funny thing you like this 

00:02:50.459 --> 00:02:53.610
 because it means that when the cars arrive the boxes are no longer needed 

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:57.890
 to run fast for he managed to take pictures because the mechanics stand a 

00:02:57.889 --> 00:03:01.760
 a little further from this is the technical aspect that concerns above all yours 

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.299
 I work here roses and then this trial too 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:07.939
 speaks with felipe massa about first impressions felipe massa
