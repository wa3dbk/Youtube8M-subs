00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:08.149
 How does it stop moving? This time I will talk about the subject of how human value is determined 

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:11.990
 I hope to do it 

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:15.019
 Well, people are all about money 

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:16.830
 Yea or a would be important face is the most 

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:20.760
 Even without money 

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:25.529
 If a person with a beautiful heart is the most valuable person 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:31.690
 Is that what is correct for most really but I think that various discussion even raise 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:39.520
 I think I would like to pursue this thoroughly and deeply about this 

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:44.810
 I have taught me how to make money mostly and I think it's really important 5 times really important 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:51.380
 I'm doing that I say so yeah since the are but on the other hand 

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:56.540
 It has a worth personality it is a good guy, even poor or not it good to did not have a conversation money 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:01:01.630
 First of all, some people say that it is best to polish the inside 

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:06.920
 So even though what I become the wind Tteyuu correct Is this 

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:12.290
 There is no clear standard to determine human value 

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:14.150
 Human values This Now I had to have a textbook Toka law Toka those things determined 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.520
 Have you ever seen 

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:20.109
 It is not 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:26.860
 This is because what or say if each person values are different 

00:01:20.109 --> 00:01:33.450
 I mainly look at the face and the character when judging women, but other people are 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:33.450
 It may be different I might be interested only after super milk 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:41.570
 The occupation is a 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:42.230
 I could not think of a cabin attendant and an example and now it becomes like that 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:46.130
 But 

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:51.290
 List a different standard views to determine the person in each person 

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:53.990
 The person who had good character to buy my case is judged to be worth keeping it in a place where it's big tits 

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:57.350
 Speaking that people are worth it 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:02:02.750
 Another person also has a profession a 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:05.540
 It may be worthwhile to say that it may be worthwhile to people of your favorite occupation 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:10.789
 It's free no matter what you choose 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:13.140
 Separately, such as a person skiing you have the money and face a good person skiing is such a good girl and the ski of personality 

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:15.180
 Anything is fine 

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:19.700
 About 2 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:24.630
 Against people who are saying gold is the most important DAP 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:30.000
 The most important thing is the inside because it doesn't matter whether it is bad or poor 

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:37.140
 There is no other person who says that the human value is determined by the contents 

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:40.090
 It's so that I mean trample the rights of the person with strong emphasis this value to 

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:46.599
 Why? For example 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:47.110
 Personality is only a good boy was of being marked so defined in the wind Tteyuu there is that worth 

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:53.170
 Tara 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:58.910
 I'm no longer the kind of gene I'm extinct except the character is a good boy 

00:02:53.170 --> 00:03:05.000
 People who have money but have a personality but a good face but a bad personality 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:07.670
 Whole body Why I mean door roots gold there are many people in the middle of the night It is distinguished service in such person 

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:11.120
 It has received Dosu results added 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:14.989
 My face is good but my personality is talkative but my personality is bad 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:21.560
 On the contrary, there are a lot of people who have good personality but do not have money 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:24.250
 Why do we have so many different people? 

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.250
 Did it say whether there 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:34.130
 Some people who like rich are good because some people like rich 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:37.970
 Even if there is a person with a nice face, the face is a 

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:42.500
 It is because there are people who judge it as important 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:45.800
 It is why are now the Tteyuu exist are human beings Everyone chosen to say 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:50.080
 Someone who admits that someone is worth it 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:52.560
 So I'm not told merits related to each 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:53.940
 If you have a good personality 

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.230
 Shikane 

00:03:53.940 --> 00:04:00.420
 1 

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:05.940
 If it is judged that it is not worth, just a rich person or a person who has a good face 

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:09.440
 It will die. If such people are worthless, such a thing is totally 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:09.440
 Not because it's not 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:17.470
 People to be this correct Tteyuu money's all 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:23.400
 The person who says that the content is the most important is correct 

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:27.419
 Just denying people's values ​​is that this is wrong in the first place 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:29.330
 I I think you have defeated and if he's all gold 

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:33.949
 I hate it there 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:38.920
 Brush your more dream without thinking such a thing because I also a poor 

00:04:33.949 --> 00:04:43.770
 If there is a person who uses it, it is wrong 

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:48.300
 It has nothing to do with gold cacao or content or superiority 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:51.870
 Since not each of which is under at each of values 

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:57.030
 It's not clear which one is the most important . 

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:59.560
 But there is I majority of the problem or a likely to be the most popular person is a good face that sort of 

00:04:57.030 --> 00:05:06.760
 I think you many also entertainers 

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:11.900
 There are alternative celebrities who are popular celebrities or who are not popular celebrities 

00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:15.530
 Certainly it depends on the number, but 

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:20.900
 Because there were many, it was worth it 

00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:21.200
 The number is not popular It is not popular It is not worth buying that person is worth it 

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:25.330
 is 

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:29.139
 Everyone who survives now is worthwhile 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:32.889
 So if to you too 

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:38.379
 That is what you do 

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:39.699
 If there is a person who is more concerned with polishing the contents which is not worthwhile 

00:05:38.379 --> 00:05:44.320
 I think that is good 

00:05:39.699 --> 00:05:47.360
 The point is whether you are in line with your values 

00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:51.070
 a Well I tell you this video 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:55.180
 Wings of Tteyuu those Tteyuu and wanted to say through 

00:05:51.070 --> 00:06:00.700
