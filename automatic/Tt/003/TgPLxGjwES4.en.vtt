00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:52.170 
we went to Harbor Freight and we got

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.869 
we went to Harbor Freight and we got
this<00:00:52.469> thing<00:00:52.969> it's<00:00:53.969> called<00:00:54.090> a<00:00:54.570> needle<00:00:54.899> scaler

00:00:55.869 --> 00:00:55.879 
this thing it's called a needle scaler

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:58.970 
this thing it's called a needle scaler
it's<00:00:56.879> a<00:00:57.059> giant<00:00:57.629> air<00:00:57.840> powered<00:00:58.379> metal

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
it's a giant air powered metal

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.709 
it's a giant air powered metal
contraption<00:00:59.340> the<00:00:59.850> way<00:01:00.000> is<00:01:00.059> a<00:01:00.300> fair<00:01:00.539> bit

00:01:00.709 --> 00:01:00.719 
contraption the way is a fair bit

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.439 
contraption the way is a fair bit
actually<00:01:01.170> it's<00:01:01.260> my<00:01:01.350> heaviest<00:01:01.620> air<00:01:01.890> tool<00:01:02.100> and

00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:02.449 
actually it's my heaviest air tool and

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:04.880 
actually it's my heaviest air tool and
has<00:01:03.449> needles<00:01:03.899> to<00:01:04.049> come<00:01:04.199> out<00:01:04.290> of<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.470> end<00:01:04.619> and

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:04.890 
has needles to come out of the end and

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.250 
has needles to come out of the end and
when<00:01:05.640> you<00:01:05.700> press<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.180> lever<00:01:08.780> the<00:01:09.780> needles<00:01:10.110> go

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
when you press the lever the needles go

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.760 
when you press the lever the needles go
crazy<00:01:10.590> let<00:01:11.520> me<00:01:11.610> show<00:01:11.850> you<00:01:11.909> what<00:01:12.210> this<00:01:12.330> does<00:01:12.770> to

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
crazy let me show you what this does to

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.310 
crazy let me show you what this does to
questionable<00:01:14.580> looking<00:01:14.939> metal<00:01:15.240> I'm<00:01:15.960> gonna<00:01:16.080> put

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
questionable looking metal I'm gonna put

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:24.670 
questionable looking metal I'm gonna put
on<00:01:16.409> my<00:01:16.530> ears<00:01:16.799> here<00:01:17.130> and<00:01:17.310> then<00:01:17.400> we'll<00:01:17.640> go<00:01:17.790> out

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:24.680 

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.929 

I'm<00:01:25.680> not<00:01:25.860> gonna<00:01:25.950> be<00:01:26.130> pushing<00:01:26.369> I'm<00:01:26.670> gonna<00:01:26.820> let

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
I'm not gonna be pushing I'm gonna let

00:01:26.939 --> 00:02:54.430 
I'm not gonna be pushing I'm gonna let
the<00:01:27.030> weight<00:01:27.180> of<00:01:27.270> the<00:01:27.330> tool<00:01:27.509> do<00:01:27.720> the<00:01:27.750> work<00:01:27.869> here

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.640 

so<00:02:55.440> this<00:02:55.590> thing<00:02:56.420> basically<00:02:57.420> makes<00:02:58.050> anything

00:02:58.640 --> 00:02:58.650 
so this thing basically makes anything

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:00.980 
so this thing basically makes anything
that's<00:02:59.160> not<00:02:59.340> extremely<00:03:00.120> well<00:03:00.330> attached<00:03:00.690> to

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:00.990 
that's not extremely well attached to

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:03.260 
that's not extremely well attached to
disappear<00:03:01.530> and<00:03:02.220> so<00:03:02.400> when<00:03:02.550> you've<00:03:02.670> got<00:03:02.700> thicker

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:03.270 
disappear and so when you've got thicker

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:05.900 
disappear and so when you've got thicker
flicking<00:03:03.930> multi-layer<00:03:04.560> rest<00:03:04.860> like<00:03:05.040> that<00:03:05.280> this

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
flicking multi-layer rest like that this

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.930 
flicking multi-layer rest like that this
thing<00:03:06.150> makes<00:03:06.390> real<00:03:06.660> short<00:03:06.990> work<00:03:07.170> of<00:03:07.290> it<00:03:07.820> and<00:03:08.820> so

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
thing makes real short work of it and so

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.570 
thing makes real short work of it and so
you<00:03:09.000> can<00:03:09.210> see<00:03:09.420> here<00:03:10.010> the<00:03:11.010> battle<00:03:11.220> I've<00:03:11.400> got

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:11.580 
you can see here the battle I've got

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.450 
you can see here the battle I've got
left<00:03:11.790> with<00:03:12.500> it's<00:03:13.500> always<00:03:13.680> pretty<00:03:13.950> good<00:03:14.070> shape

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:14.460 
left with it's always pretty good shape

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:16.520 
left with it's always pretty good shape
that<00:03:15.180> flaky<00:03:15.630> stuff<00:03:15.900> that<00:03:16.050> you<00:03:16.140> saw<00:03:16.290> that's

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
that flaky stuff that you saw that's

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.980 
that flaky stuff that you saw that's
gone<00:03:16.860> now<00:03:17.100> this<00:03:17.430> got<00:03:17.670> rid<00:03:17.850> of<00:03:17.880> it<00:03:18.060> anywhere<00:03:18.930> it

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:18.990 
gone now this got rid of it anywhere it

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:20.300 
gone now this got rid of it anywhere it
looks<00:03:19.170> like<00:03:19.320> we<00:03:19.440> have<00:03:19.590> little<00:03:19.830> ridge<00:03:20.040> lines

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310 
looks like we have little ridge lines

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:21.710 
looks like we have little ridge lines
like<00:03:20.550> that<00:03:20.700> we<00:03:20.940> can<00:03:21.060> go<00:03:21.180> out<00:03:21.300> a<00:03:21.390> little<00:03:21.510> bit

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:21.720 
like that we can go out a little bit

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:53.510 
like that we can go out a little bit
more<00:03:21.870> this<00:03:22.080> guy

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:53.520 

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:56.430 

so<00:03:54.520> this<00:03:54.670> thing<00:03:54.880> is<00:03:54.910> pretty<00:03:55.120> awesome<00:03:55.480> is<00:03:55.840> 44

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:56.440 
so this thing is pretty awesome is 44
