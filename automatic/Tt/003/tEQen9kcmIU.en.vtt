00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
are red right here and they kind of look

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.760 
are red right here and they kind of look
quilted<00:01:35.909> if<00:01:36.540> you<00:01:36.720> look<00:01:36.930> closely<00:01:37.229> which<00:01:37.619> you'll

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
quilted if you look closely which you'll

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.090 
quilted if you look closely which you'll
see<00:01:37.799> later<00:01:37.979> on<00:01:38.220> but<00:01:39.030> they<00:01:39.990> are<00:01:40.170> black<00:01:40.470> gray<00:01:40.920> and

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
see later on but they are black gray and

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.429 
see later on but they are black gray and
red<00:01:41.369> and<00:01:41.670> then<00:01:42.119> the<00:01:42.270> laces<00:01:42.630> are<00:01:42.840> met<00:01:43.049> and<00:01:43.229> these

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
red and then the laces are met and these

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.499 
red and then the laces are met and these
are<00:01:43.560> the<00:01:43.680> superphone<00:01:44.220> as<00:01:44.430> well<00:01:44.729> because

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
are the superphone as well because

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:47.569 
are the superphone as well because
inside<00:01:45.899> it's<00:01:46.110> all<00:01:46.320> foam<00:01:46.799> so<00:01:47.280> it's<00:01:47.430> really

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
inside it's all foam so it's really

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.819 
inside it's all foam so it's really
comfortable<00:01:47.970> to<00:01:48.149> walk<00:01:48.360> in<00:01:48.659> and<00:01:49.020> it<00:01:49.560> just<00:01:49.710> has

00:01:49.819 --> 00:01:49.829 
comfortable to walk in and it just has

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:52.219 
comfortable to walk in and it just has
red<00:01:50.070> bottoms<00:01:50.100> I<00:01:50.850> think<00:01:51.090> supers<00:01:51.479> are<00:01:51.630> great<00:01:51.899> for

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
thought that was like a must for it and

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.490 
thought that was like a must for it and
then<00:03:21.670> also<00:03:21.880> for<00:03:22.180> the<00:03:22.330> shoes<00:03:22.630> they<00:03:22.930> are<00:03:22.959> swayed

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:27.120 
then also for the shoes they are swayed
and<00:03:23.820> these<00:03:24.820> are<00:03:25.090> the<00:03:25.300> supras<00:03:25.840> and<00:03:26.080> they<00:03:26.980> have

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.130 
and these are the supras and they have

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:28.890 
and these are the supras and they have
the<00:03:27.280> red<00:03:27.430> net<00:03:27.670> which<00:03:27.940> also<00:03:28.180> matches<00:03:28.660> with<00:03:28.870> the

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:28.900 
the red net which also matches with the

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:30.840

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:30.850 
Panthers tongue on his shirt so I

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:33.750

with a strapless tank which was black

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:51.910 
with a strapless tank which was black
just<00:04:50.780> so<00:04:50.930> I<00:04:50.960> could<00:04:51.110> put<00:04:51.350> the<00:04:51.500> outfit<00:04:51.740> together

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:51.920
