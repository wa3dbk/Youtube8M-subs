00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:49.550
 what does it mean 

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:52.550
 not less than six months 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:55.630
 and yes the video 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:57.370
 marrying the plain 

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:58.440
 and that's a shame 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:01.440
 you have more info here than there are coffee beans in brazil 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:06.549
 for example let's take that whoever says by afp all the way down 

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:12.869
 but she and her friend the high school teacher tell us about it 

00:02:12.869 --> 00:02:15.869
 beginnings 

00:02:16.939 --> 00:02:20.349
 cesana thank you teacher 

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:23.349
 this story takes us to the South Pole 

00:02:26.699 --> 00:02:29.449
 wait a moment now you see his positions when a 

00:02:29.449 --> 00:02:31.039
 boy rather the room 

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:32.360
 dish 

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:33.599
 like that it's clear 

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:36.599
 the two things we meet most often a little 6 years 

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:38.789
 ice 

00:02:38.789 --> 00:02:40.969
 and the time 

00:02:40.969 --> 00:02:45.140
 it's amazing that people can enjoy themselves in this country and yet the 

00:02:45.139 --> 00:02:48.139
 most people would not want to live elsewhere for all the gold in the world 

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:52.199
 you might find it's true of better climate for fishing 

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:54.719
 ski 

00:02:54.719 --> 00:02:56.069
 they need 

00:02:56.069 --> 00:02:58.399
 he put pressure 

00:02:58.399 --> 00:03:02.299
 laura harris and merignac a penguin will prefer a day the dish 

00:03:05.679 --> 00:03:09.379
 but wait I had to present you at the table he lives after 

00:03:09.379 --> 00:03:10.549
 the main street 

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:13.729
 coming back plume time to see a little what he does 

00:03:13.729 --> 00:03:17.349
 picture of setbacks of right does not remember having put in his days 

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:21.459
 also his best friend and they are naked I assumed 

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:34.439
 between two shivers dashboard and hugo almeida to gingham to finish his 

00:03:34.439 --> 00:03:37.439
 days on a tropical beach 

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:43.289
 here it is so we relax courageously in road to city of 

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:46.709
 ceret his friends from a corner to the lot to wish him good trip 

00:03:48.149 --> 00:03:51.149
 but as soon as they move away from his hair 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:55.289
 l 

00:03:55.289 --> 00:03:58.289
 christiane 

00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:02.599
 tavares 

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:05.599
 maybe he will give up and his insane ideas 

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:10.299
 he's ready to start again 

00:04:10.829 --> 00:04:12.589
