motor upright which means cutter

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:50.859 
motor upright which means cutter
changing<00:01:50.090> very<00:01:50.329> much<00:01:50.450> easier

what's<00:01:51.380> more<00:01:51.649> the<00:01:52.159> integral<00:01:52.639> spindle<00:01:53.090> lock

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:53.270 
what's more the integral spindle lock

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.260 
what's more the integral spindle lock
means<00:01:53.959> you<00:01:54.139> only<00:01:54.259> need<00:01:54.530> a<00:01:54.770> single<00:01:55.069> spanner<00:01:55.579> to

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.270 
means you only need a single spanner to

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.629 
means you only need a single spanner to
fit<00:01:56.509> the<00:01:56.659> cutter<00:01:56.899> the<00:01:57.409> body<00:01:57.619> itself<00:01:58.009> is<00:01:58.579> a

fit the cutter the body itself is a

00:01:58.639 --> 00:02:00.879 
fit the cutter the body itself is a
strong<00:01:59.179> aluminium<00:01:59.899> casting<00:02:00.350> for<00:02:00.529> long<00:02:00.649> life

strong aluminium casting for long life

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:03.999 
strong aluminium casting for long life
but<00:02:01.789> it's<00:02:02.209> just<00:02:02.479> 200<00:02:03.049> millimeters<00:02:03.499> long<00:02:03.709> and

but it's just 200 millimeters long and
weighs<00:02:04.340> 1.8<00:02:05.060> kilograms<00:02:05.539> so<00:02:05.719> it's<00:02:05.840> dead<00:02:06.049> easy

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200 
weighs 1.8 kilograms so it's dead easy
