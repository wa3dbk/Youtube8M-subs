okay<00:04:29.949> sauce<00:04:30.949> trying<00:04:31.340> to<00:04:31.400> play<00:04:31.580> this<00:04:31.729> a<00:04:31.789> kind<00:04:32.240> of

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.330 
okay sauce trying to play this a kind of

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.270 
okay sauce trying to play this a kind of
static<00:04:32.690> style<00:04:32.930> I<00:04:33.199> don't<00:04:33.710> think<00:04:34.039> it'll<00:04:34.220> work

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:34.280 
static style I don't think it'll work

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:36.219 
static style I don't think it'll work
out<00:04:34.550> I<00:04:34.639> think<00:04:34.820> that<00:04:35.210> duck<00:04:35.449> kind<00:04:35.750> of<00:04:35.930> has<00:04:36.050> the

00:04:36.219 --> 00:04:36.229 
out I think that duck kind of has the

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:38.290 
out I think that duck kind of has the
market<00:04:36.590> cornered<00:04:36.830> on<00:04:37.100> that<00:04:37.310> style<00:04:37.580> yeah<00:04:37.940> oh<00:04:38.240> I

00:04:38.290 --> 00:04:38.300 
market cornered on that style yeah oh I

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:40.000 
market cornered on that style yeah oh I
feel<00:04:39.050> like<00:04:39.139> he's<00:04:39.320> gonna<00:04:39.440> have<00:04:39.620> to<00:04:39.710> put<00:04:39.860> on<00:04:39.950> the

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:40.010 
feel like he's gonna have to put on the

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:41.560 
feel like he's gonna have to put on the
pressure<00:04:40.160> if<00:04:40.430> he<00:04:40.550> wants<00:04:40.760> to<00:04:40.789> get<00:04:40.970> this<00:04:41.060> but<00:04:41.300> the

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:41.570 
pressure if he wants to get this but the

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:43.090 
pressure if he wants to get this but the
problem<00:04:41.870> is<00:04:41.930> that<00:04:42.200> pressure<00:04:42.440> has<00:04:42.680> to<00:04:42.710> be<00:04:42.919> so

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:43.100 
problem is that pressure has to be so

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:45.279 
problem is that pressure has to be so

lot of SAMHSA's here in Canada as

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:21.580 
lot of SAMHSA's here in Canada as

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:21.590 
evidenced by our top players

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:23.830 
evidenced by our top players
performances<00:06:22.280> against<00:06:22.640> Santos<00:06:22.970> yeah<00:06:23.210> I<00:06:23.510> think

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:23.840 
performances against Santos yeah I think

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:26.080 
performances against Santos yeah I think
the<00:06:24.170> main<00:06:24.320> things<00:06:24.560> about<00:06:24.800> the<00:06:24.950> stage<00:06:25.190> are<00:06:25.760> that

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:26.090 
the main things about the stage are that

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:29.560 
the main things about the stage are that
one<00:06:26.690> combo<00:06:27.230> games<00:06:27.410> although<00:06:27.560> that<00:06:27.830> was<00:06:27.980> a<00:06:28.570> yeah

00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:29.570 
one combo games although that was a yeah

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:31.750 
one combo games although that was a yeah
so<00:06:30.410> what<00:06:30.830> the<00:06:30.980> comic<00:06:31.310> game<00:06:31.430> is<00:06:31.520> a<00:06:31.550> little

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:31.760 
so what the comic game is a little

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:34.090 
so what the comic game is a little
better<00:06:31.880> for<00:06:32.060> Fox<00:06:32.530> because<00:06:33.530> again<00:06:33.770> if<00:06:33.860> you<00:06:33.950> get

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:34.100 
better for Fox because again if you get

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:36.910 
better for Fox because again if you get
down<00:06:34.820> there<00:06:35.060> you<00:06:35.870> can<00:06:36.020> get<00:06:36.170> like<00:06:36.320> five<00:06:36.650> years

00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:36.920 
down there you can get like five years

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:38.680 
down there you can get like five years
in<00:06:37.040> a<00:06:37.100> row<00:06:37.130> on<00:06:37.310> Santa's<00:06:37.670> and<00:06:37.820> the<00:06:38.030> punch<00:06:38.480> game

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:38.690 
in a row on Santa's and the punch game

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:40.000 
in a row on Santa's and the punch game
is<00:06:38.780> a<00:06:38.810> little<00:06:38.900> worse<00:06:39.110> for<00:06:39.350> service<00:06:39.650> because

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:40.010 
is a little worse for service because

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:42.070 
is a little worse for service because
she<00:06:40.490> doesn't<00:06:40.670> get<00:06:40.820> those<00:06:40.940> those<00:06:41.270> nasty<00:06:41.900> like

00:06:42.070 --> 00:06:42.080 
she doesn't get those those nasty like

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:44.200 
she doesn't get those those nasty like
down<00:06:42.410> air<00:06:42.680> tech<00:06:43.310> chases<00:06:43.610> on<00:06:43.730> the<00:06:43.790> platform

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:44.210 
down air tech chases on the platform

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:46.630 
down air tech chases on the platform
right<00:06:44.510> she<00:06:45.410> wants<00:06:45.710> those<00:06:45.860> platforms<00:06:46.130> there

00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:46.640 
right she wants those platforms there

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:48.970 
right she wants those platforms there
for<00:06:47.090> the<00:06:47.150> most<00:06:47.330> part<00:06:47.630> yeah<00:06:47.900> she<00:06:48.560> likes<00:06:48.770> those<00:06:48.920> a

00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:48.980 
for the most part yeah she likes those a

00:06:48.980 --> 00:06:50.980 
for the most part yeah she likes those a
lot<00:06:49.160> that<00:06:49.340> was<00:06:49.430> a<00:06:49.490> nice<00:06:49.820> nice<00:06:50.420> back<00:06:50.720> here<00:06:50.900> the

00:06:50.980 --> 00:06:50.990 
lot that was a nice nice back here the

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:52.630 
lot that was a nice nice back here the
one<00:06:51.110> thing<00:06:51.260> I'll<00:06:51.440> say<00:06:51.470> though<00:06:51.800> is<00:06:51.980> that<00:06:52.010> on

00:06:52.630 --> 00:06:52.640 
one thing I'll say though is that on

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:54.700 
one thing I'll say though is that on
this<00:06:52.850> stage<00:06:53.060> once<00:06:53.450> Fox<00:06:53.690> is<00:06:53.900> offset<00:06:54.230> off<00:06:54.410> stage

00:06:54.700 --> 00:06:54.710 
this stage once Fox is offset off stage

00:06:54.710 --> 00:06:56.950 
this stage once Fox is offset off stage
he<00:06:54.740> doesn't<00:06:55.310> have<00:06:55.490> that<00:06:56.030> platform<00:06:56.630> to<00:06:56.690> go<00:06:56.900> to

00:06:56.950 --> 00:06:56.960 
he doesn't have that platform to go to

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:58.540 
he doesn't have that platform to go to
to<00:06:57.230> get<00:06:57.380> a<00:06:57.410> little<00:06:57.710> bit<00:06:57.830> more<00:06:57.950> safe<00:06:58.220> right

00:06:58.540 --> 00:06:58.550 
to get a little bit more safe right

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:00.310 
to get a little bit more safe right
right<00:06:58.790> right<00:06:58.850> there<00:06:59.210> is<00:06:59.330> a<00:06:59.450> duck<00:06:59.870> being<00:07:00.110> so
