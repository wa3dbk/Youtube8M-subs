Tennessee and I'd like to say a few
words<00:00:06.569> about<00:00:06.779> the<00:00:07.109> restoration<00:00:07.830> of<00:00:07.919> books<00:00:08.750> we

words about the restoration of books we

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.990 
words about the restoration of books we
can<00:00:09.780> basically<00:00:10.380> rebind<00:00:11.040> anything<00:00:11.700> any

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
can basically rebind anything any

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.720 
can basically rebind anything any
century<00:00:12.360> any<00:00:12.900> style<00:00:13.320> but<00:00:14.070> when<00:00:14.219> we're<00:00:14.400> working

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
century any style but when we're working

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.519 
century any style but when we're working
with<00:00:14.910> things<00:00:15.179> that<00:00:15.269> have<00:00:15.509> historic<00:00:16.080> or

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
with things that have historic or

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.650 
with things that have historic or
aesthetic<00:00:17.070> value<00:00:17.490> we're<00:00:18.000> trying<00:00:18.240> to<00:00:18.330> preserve

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
aesthetic value we're trying to preserve

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.540 
aesthetic value we're trying to preserve
as<00:00:18.840> much<00:00:19.020> of<00:00:19.080> the<00:00:19.320> original<00:00:19.710> binding<00:00:19.949> as<00:00:20.279> we

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
as much of the original binding as we

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.820 
as much of the original binding as we
can<00:00:20.880> this<00:00:21.420> is<00:00:21.480> what<00:00:21.750> conservation<00:00:22.470> is<00:00:22.590> called

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:22.830 
can this is what conservation is called

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.740 
can this is what conservation is called
minimal<00:00:23.310> intervention<00:00:23.880> and<00:00:24.390> so<00:00:24.449> I<00:00:24.510> want<00:00:24.689> to

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:24.750 
minimal intervention and so I want to

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.769 
minimal intervention and so I want to
give<00:00:24.930> you<00:00:25.080> three<00:00:25.680> different<00:00:25.800> examples<00:00:26.670> of

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:26.779 
give you three different examples of

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:29.320 
give you three different examples of
different<00:00:27.779> approaches<00:00:28.260> to<00:00:28.310> binding

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:29.330 
different approaches to binding

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.209 
different approaches to binding
utilizing<00:00:30.330> that<00:00:30.599> technique<00:00:31.050> the<00:00:31.500> first<00:00:31.529> is<00:00:32.040> a

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
utilizing that technique the first is a

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:36.650 
utilizing that technique the first is a
book<00:00:32.520> from<00:00:32.820> the<00:00:33.120> late<00:00:34.020> 18<00:00:34.829> early<00:00:34.969> 1900s<00:00:35.969> it's<00:00:36.510> a

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
book from the late 18 early 1900s it's a

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:39.590 
book from the late 18 early 1900s it's a
good<00:00:36.870> example<00:00:37.020> of<00:00:37.530> a<00:00:37.790> publisher's<00:00:38.790> stamped

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
good example of a publisher's stamped

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.209 
good example of a publisher's stamped
binding<00:00:40.079> that<00:00:40.230> was<00:00:40.379> done<00:00:40.620> originally<00:00:40.890> in

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
binding that was done originally in

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:42.709 
binding that was done originally in
several<00:00:41.610> colors<00:00:41.969> it's<00:00:42.180> just<00:00:42.360> a<00:00:42.480> very

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
several colors it's just a very

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:44.779 
several colors it's just a very
intricate<00:00:43.469> piece<00:00:43.829> it'd<00:00:43.980> be<00:00:44.100> very<00:00:44.129> hard<00:00:44.579> for<00:00:44.640> us

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
intricate piece it'd be very hard for us

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:47.389 
intricate piece it'd be very hard for us
to<00:00:44.910> replicate<00:00:45.239> it<00:00:45.660> and<00:00:45.809> it's<00:00:46.379> a<00:00:46.469> great<00:00:46.770> example

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
to replicate it and it's a great example

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.270 
to replicate it and it's a great example
of<00:00:47.910> something<00:00:48.899> that<00:00:49.050> it's<00:00:49.469> worth<00:00:49.649> saving<00:00:49.980> all

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
of something that it's worth saving all

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.610 
of something that it's worth saving all
the<00:00:50.430> original<00:00:50.820> parts<00:00:51.120> for<00:00:51.390> it<00:00:51.989> came<00:00:52.260> in<00:00:52.440> with

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620 
the original parts for it came in with

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.350 
the original parts for it came in with
the<00:00:52.739> covers<00:00:53.070> detached<00:00:53.460> in<00:00:53.730> the<00:00:53.850> in<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:54.090> spine

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
the covers detached in the in the spine

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.470 
the covers detached in the in the spine
dangling<00:00:54.899> and<00:00:55.100> in<00:00:56.100> this<00:00:56.340> case<00:00:56.640> what<00:00:57.059> we<00:00:57.180> wanted

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
dangling and in this case what we wanted

00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:59.900 
dangling and in this case what we wanted
to<00:00:57.570> do<00:00:57.719> was<00:00:57.989> again<00:00:58.710> save<00:00:59.070> as<00:00:59.370> much<00:00:59.579> of<00:00:59.640> the

00:00:59.900 --> 00:00:59.910 
to do was again save as much of the

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.630 
to do was again save as much of the
original<00:00:59.940> as<00:01:00.359> we<00:01:00.539> could<00:01:00.840> so<00:01:01.500> we<00:01:01.739> lifted<00:01:02.160> up<00:01:02.280> the

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
original as we could so we lifted up the

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.240 
original as we could so we lifted up the
cloth<00:01:02.910> from<00:01:03.090> the<00:01:03.180> sides<00:01:03.539> we<00:01:04.199> ran<00:01:04.470> new<00:01:04.710> material

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
cloth from the sides we ran new material

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.330 
cloth from the sides we ran new material
all<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:05.670> way<00:01:06.119> around<00:01:06.540> to<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.500> other<00:01:07.530> side<00:01:07.770> and

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
all the way around to the other side and

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.640 
all the way around to the other side and
then<00:01:08.820> put<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.119> spine<00:01:09.479> back<00:01:09.689> over<00:01:10.020> the<00:01:10.140> top<00:01:10.350> and

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
then put the spine back over the top and

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.859 
then put the spine back over the top and
what<00:01:10.770> we've<00:01:10.890> ended<00:01:11.010> up<00:01:11.250> with<00:01:11.310> is<00:01:11.670> a<00:01:12.060> repair<00:01:12.840> job

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:12.869 
what we've ended up with is a repair job

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.399 
what we've ended up with is a repair job
where<00:01:13.409> the<00:01:13.619> only<00:01:13.830> visible<00:01:15.200> restoration<00:01:16.200> is

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
where the only visible restoration is

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:18.920 
where the only visible restoration is
right<00:01:16.770> inside<00:01:17.159> these<00:01:17.430> joints<00:01:18.090> here<00:01:18.119> and<00:01:18.509> then

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
right inside these joints here and then

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.480 
right inside these joints here and then
a<00:01:18.960> little<00:01:19.170> bit<00:01:19.320> at<00:01:19.470> the<00:01:19.710> head<00:01:19.890> in<00:01:20.009> the<00:01:20.070> tail<00:01:20.280> of

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:20.490 
a little bit at the head in the tail of

00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:22.999 
a little bit at the head in the tail of
the<00:01:20.610> spine<00:01:20.909> and<00:01:21.180> I<00:01:21.330> don't<00:01:21.390> know<00:01:21.780> if<00:01:21.960> the<00:01:22.619> camera

00:01:22.999 --> 00:01:23.009 
the spine and I don't know if the camera

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.830 
the spine and I don't know if the camera
will<00:01:23.159> even<00:01:23.490> pick<00:01:23.670> this<00:01:23.820> up<00:01:24.000> very<00:01:24.270> well<00:01:24.330> but<00:01:24.540> the

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
will even pick this up very well but the

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:27.109 
will even pick this up very well but the
goal<00:01:25.049> is<00:01:25.080> to<00:01:25.530> make<00:01:25.710> the<00:01:25.920> repairs<00:01:26.119> fairly

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
goal is to make the repairs fairly

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.100 
goal is to make the repairs fairly
invisible<00:01:28.159> now<00:01:29.159> another<00:01:29.520> problem<00:01:30.450> that<00:01:30.780> often

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:31.110 
invisible now another problem that often

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:32.810 
invisible now another problem that often
arises<00:01:31.380> is<00:01:31.740> when<00:01:31.920> we've<00:01:32.040> got<00:01:32.220> material<00:01:32.520> that's

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
arises is when we've got material that's

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.899 
arises is when we've got material that's
just<00:01:33.090> too<00:01:33.240> damaged<00:01:33.689> to<00:01:33.810> to<00:01:34.799> save<00:01:35.070> at<00:01:35.310> all<00:01:35.460> a<00:01:35.490> big

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
just too damaged to to save at all a big

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.030 
just too damaged to to save at all a big
chunk<00:01:36.210> missing<00:01:36.630> from<00:01:36.840> a<00:01:36.930> spine<00:01:37.229> for<00:01:37.560> example

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:38.040 
chunk missing from a spine for example

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.910 
chunk missing from a spine for example
and<00:01:38.189> this<00:01:38.610> is<00:01:38.670> a<00:01:38.820> case<00:01:39.439> of<00:01:40.439> a<00:01:40.560> book<00:01:40.740> from<00:01:40.829> the

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:40.920 
and this is a case of a book from the

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:43.429 
and this is a case of a book from the
1500s<00:01:41.549> worth<00:01:41.909> really<00:01:42.600> that's<00:01:42.840> exactly<00:01:43.320> what

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
1500s worth really that's exactly what

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.780 
1500s worth really that's exactly what
was<00:01:43.530> wrong<00:01:43.770> the<00:01:44.430> spine<00:01:44.909> was<00:01:45.979> broken<00:01:46.979> and<00:01:47.159> the

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
was wrong the spine was broken and the

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.090 
was wrong the spine was broken and the
joints<00:01:48.659> of<00:01:48.750> course<00:01:48.990> were<00:01:49.140> broken<00:01:49.530> as<00:01:49.649> well<00:01:49.680> and

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
joints of course were broken as well and

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.490 
joints of course were broken as well and
so<00:01:50.759> here<00:01:51.030> we've<00:01:51.180> got<00:01:51.210> corners<00:01:51.899> that<00:01:52.110> are<00:01:52.259> in

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
so here we've got corners that are in

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.069 
so here we've got corners that are in
original<00:01:53.399> and<00:01:53.579> in<00:01:53.700> good<00:01:53.850> shape<00:01:53.909> but<00:01:54.630> we<00:01:54.780> wanted

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
original and in good shape but we wanted

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.580 
original and in good shape but we wanted
to<00:01:56.030> put<00:01:57.030> leather<00:01:57.270> back<00:01:57.509> on<00:01:57.750> that<00:01:57.990> matched<00:01:58.320> as

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:58.590 
to put leather back on that matched as

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.770 
to put leather back on that matched as
closely<00:01:58.890> as<00:01:59.130> we<00:01:59.159> could<00:01:59.490> the<00:01:59.670> original<00:02:00.119> so<00:02:00.479> even

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
closely as we could the original so even

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.600 
closely as we could the original so even
to<00:02:01.290> the<00:02:01.469> tooling<00:02:01.860> of<00:02:01.979> this<00:02:02.130> little<00:02:02.369> triple

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:02.610 
to the tooling of this little triple

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:05.300 
to the tooling of this little triple
line<00:02:02.880> right<00:02:03.210> along<00:02:03.329> the<00:02:03.659> border<00:02:03.780> here<00:02:04.320> we<00:02:05.100> have

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
line right along the border here we have

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.760 
line right along the border here we have
worked<00:02:05.850> new<00:02:06.090> leather<00:02:06.329> on<00:02:06.540> over<00:02:06.930> the<00:02:07.079> spine<00:02:07.560> and

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:07.770 
worked new leather on over the spine and

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.680 
worked new leather on over the spine and
then<00:02:07.890> on<00:02:08.039> the<00:02:08.129> inside<00:02:08.280> and<00:02:08.819> I'm<00:02:09.360> quite<00:02:09.629> sure

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:09.690 
then on the inside and I'm quite sure

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:11.630 
then on the inside and I'm quite sure
the<00:02:10.020> camera<00:02:10.289> won't<00:02:10.440> pick<00:02:10.619> this<00:02:10.770> up<00:02:11.009> but<00:02:11.489> we've

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:11.640 
the camera won't pick this up but we've

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:14.300 
the camera won't pick this up but we've
got<00:02:11.819> new<00:02:12.000> paper<00:02:12.270> that<00:02:12.870> runs<00:02:13.140> underneath

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:14.310 
got new paper that runs underneath

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.970 
got new paper that runs underneath
the<00:02:14.420> pace<00:02:15.420> down<00:02:15.660> here<00:02:16.020> and<00:02:16.230> the<00:02:16.290> Flyleaf<00:02:16.709> here

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
the pace down here and the Flyleaf here

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.370 
the pace down here and the Flyleaf here
and<00:02:17.190> it's<00:02:17.970> visible<00:02:18.540> if<00:02:18.720> you<00:02:18.959> know<00:02:19.110> what<00:02:19.260> you're

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.380 
and it's visible if you know what you're

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.320 
and it's visible if you know what you're
looking<00:02:19.620> for<00:02:19.800> right<00:02:20.040> along<00:02:20.520> the<00:02:20.730> inside<00:02:20.760> of

looking for right along the inside of
this<00:02:21.510> of<00:02:21.720> this<00:02:22.319> edge<00:02:22.620> right<00:02:22.950> here<00:02:23.060> so<00:02:24.060> this

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
this of this edge right here so this

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.180 
this of this edge right here so this
would<00:02:24.870> be<00:02:24.990> an<00:02:25.080> example<00:02:25.200> then<00:02:25.680> of<00:02:25.800> needing<00:02:26.160> to

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:26.190 
would be an example then of needing to

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:28.280 
would be an example then of needing to
replace<00:02:26.400> certain<00:02:26.910> structural<00:02:27.540> parts<00:02:28.020> of<00:02:28.200> the

replace certain structural parts of the

replace certain structural parts of the
binding<00:02:28.709> but<00:02:29.130> saving<00:02:29.760> the<00:02:29.850> original<00:02:30.209> flavor

and the original feel and as much as we

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:36.020 
and the original feel and as much as we

could of the original now a third
example<00:02:36.450> is<00:02:36.860> where<00:02:37.860> we've<00:02:38.010> got<00:02:38.130> a<00:02:38.160> completely

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:38.760 
example is where we've got a completely

new<00:02:39.120> binding<00:02:39.630> on<00:02:39.780> an<00:02:40.350> old<00:02:40.560> book<00:02:40.860> and<00:02:41.069> this<00:02:41.160> book

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
new binding on an old book and this book

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.680 
new binding on an old book and this book
is<00:02:41.640> from<00:02:42.209> the<00:02:42.390> 1400s<00:02:43.080> it<00:02:43.590> came<00:02:43.860> in<00:02:44.069> with<00:02:44.280> a

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:44.690 
is from the 1400s it came in with a

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:46.759 
is from the 1400s it came in with a
nineteenth-century<00:02:45.690> binding<00:02:46.470> and<00:02:46.560> pretty

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
nineteenth-century binding and pretty

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:49.370 
nineteenth-century binding and pretty
rough<00:02:46.950> shape<00:02:46.980> it<00:02:47.640> had<00:02:47.760> a<00:02:48.150> leather<00:02:48.690> spine<00:02:49.110> and

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
rough shape it had a leather spine and

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.680 
rough shape it had a leather spine and
German<00:02:49.680> pace<00:02:49.860> paper<00:02:50.130> sides<00:02:50.489> and<00:02:50.820> in<00:02:51.300> this<00:02:51.420> case

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:51.690 
German pace paper sides and in this case

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.380 
German pace paper sides and in this case
the<00:02:51.930> decision<00:02:52.080> was<00:02:52.470> made<00:02:52.650> to<00:02:52.910> rebind<00:02:53.910> in<00:02:54.269> a

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:54.390 
the decision was made to rebind in a

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:56.840 
the decision was made to rebind in a
15th<00:02:55.200> century<00:02:55.320> style<00:02:55.860> binding<00:02:56.430> that<00:02:56.550> would<00:02:56.700> be

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:56.850 
15th century style binding that would be

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:59.240 
15th century style binding that would be
appropriate<00:02:57.120> for<00:02:57.510> the<00:02:57.959> book<00:02:58.140> there<00:02:58.860> was<00:02:58.950> a<00:02:58.980> lot

00:02:59.240 --> 00:02:59.250 
appropriate for the book there was a lot

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:00.770 
appropriate for the book there was a lot
of<00:02:59.280> work<00:02:59.519> on<00:02:59.700> the<00:02:59.819> inside<00:03:00.180> that<00:03:00.450> needed<00:03:00.690> to<00:03:00.720> be

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
of work on the inside that needed to be

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:03.559 
of work on the inside that needed to be
done<00:03:01.019> as<00:03:01.260> far<00:03:01.290> as<00:03:01.500> page<00:03:02.459> repair<00:03:02.850> and<00:03:03.090> then

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:03.569 
done as far as page repair and then

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:06.860 
done as far as page repair and then
resew<00:03:04.640> accords<00:03:05.640> and<00:03:05.819> then<00:03:06.330> the<00:03:06.450> binding

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
resew accords and then the binding

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.740 
resew accords and then the binding
itself<00:03:07.230> has<00:03:07.860> been<00:03:08.100> blind<00:03:08.519> tooled<00:03:08.910> without<00:03:09.569> any

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:09.750 
itself has been blind tooled without any

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:12.770 
itself has been blind tooled without any
gold<00:03:10.050> and<00:03:10.670> even<00:03:11.670> little<00:03:11.910> details<00:03:12.269> like<00:03:12.450> the

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:12.780 
gold and even little details like the

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:14.620 
gold and even little details like the
way<00:03:12.930> that<00:03:13.170> the<00:03:13.290> boards<00:03:13.590> here<00:03:13.800> are<00:03:13.920> beveled

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:14.630 
way that the boards here are beveled

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:17.809 
way that the boards here are beveled
inwards<00:03:15.630> and<00:03:15.930> all<00:03:16.890> of<00:03:17.130> this<00:03:17.280> then<00:03:17.610> would

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:17.819 
inwards and all of this then would

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:20.600 
inwards and all of this then would
suggest<00:03:18.090> to<00:03:18.450> a<00:03:18.480> collector<00:03:19.019> or<00:03:19.049> historian<00:03:19.860> that

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:20.610 
suggest to a collector or historian that

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:22.490 
suggest to a collector or historian that
this<00:03:20.760> is<00:03:20.970> appropriate<00:03:21.630> binding<00:03:22.200> for<00:03:22.320> a<00:03:22.350> book

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
this is appropriate binding for a book

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:23.600 
this is appropriate binding for a book
from<00:03:22.620> the<00:03:22.709> 1400s

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
from the 1400s

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:26.120 
from the 1400s
so<00:03:24.090> three<00:03:24.540> completely<00:03:25.260> different<00:03:25.380> approaches

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:26.130 
so three completely different approaches

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:30.620 
so three completely different approaches
to<00:03:27.530> to<00:03:28.530> restoring<00:03:29.489> an<00:03:29.610> old<00:03:29.700> book<00:03:30.000> all<00:03:30.329> with

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:30.630 
to to restoring an old book all with

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:32.840 
to to restoring an old book all with
minimal<00:03:31.110> intervention<00:03:32.010> in<00:03:32.130> mind<00:03:32.340> and<00:03:32.670> all

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:32.850 
minimal intervention in mind and all

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:34.400 
minimal intervention in mind and all
with<00:03:33.060> an<00:03:33.209> eye<00:03:33.329> towards<00:03:33.780> preserving<00:03:34.110> the

with an eye towards preserving the
original<00:03:34.500> feel<00:03:35.040> and<00:03:35.390> character<00:03:36.390> of<00:03:36.810> the<00:03:37.170> book
