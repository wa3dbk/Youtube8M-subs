this<00:00:35.969> is<00:00:36.180> the<00:00:36.300> original<00:00:36.840> track<00:00:37.190> but<00:00:38.190> they've

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
this is the original track but they've

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.900 
this is the original track but they've
come<00:00:38.850> up<00:00:38.879> with<00:00:39.000> another<00:00:39.450> tracking<00:00:40.020> system<00:00:40.469> in

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:40.910 
come up with another tracking system in

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:44.840 
come up with another tracking system in
1973<00:00:41.910> that's<00:00:42.180> more<00:00:42.450> efficient<00:00:43.050> and<00:00:43.200> it<00:00:44.100> uses<00:00:44.820> a

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
1973 that's more efficient and it uses a

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.360 
1973 that's more efficient and it uses a
plastic<00:00:45.300> glide<00:00:45.960> that's<00:00:46.410> just<00:00:46.710> sewn<00:00:46.950> onto<00:00:47.129> the

plastic glide that's just sewn onto the
drapery<00:00:47.910> in<00:00:48.360> this<00:00:48.989> particular<00:00:49.350> one<00:00:49.739> in<00:00:49.890> our

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
drapery in this particular one in our

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.119 
drapery in this particular one in our
shop<00:00:50.370> we've<00:00:50.730> decided<00:00:51.210> to<00:00:51.390> use<00:00:52.350> a<00:00:52.379> cotton<00:00:52.710> twill

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
shop we've decided to use a cotton twill

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.270 
shop we've decided to use a cotton twill
tape<00:00:53.190> on<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:54.390> glide<00:00:54.690> on<00:00:55.020> the<00:00:55.079> top<00:00:55.500> glides<00:00:55.920> on

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
tape on the glide on the top glides on

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.410 
tape on the glide on the top glides on
the<00:00:57.239> bottom<00:00:57.770> we<00:00:58.770> use<00:00:59.039> elastic<00:00:59.370> to<00:01:00.000> give<00:01:00.149> it<00:01:00.270> the

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
the bottom we use elastic to give it the

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.950 
the bottom we use elastic to give it the
mobility<00:01:01.050> we<00:01:01.230> need<00:01:02.059> but<00:01:03.059> we<00:01:03.149> use<00:01:03.420> the<00:01:03.600> cotton

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
mobility we need but we use the cotton

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.780 
mobility we need but we use the cotton
twill<00:01:04.199> tape<00:01:04.260> in<00:01:04.860> order<00:01:05.010> to<00:01:05.159> prevent<00:01:05.580> it<00:01:05.729> from

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
twill tape in order to prevent it from

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.810 
twill tape in order to prevent it from
sagging<00:01:06.689> it<00:01:07.619> always<00:01:07.770> holds<00:01:08.400> it<00:01:08.490> in<00:01:08.610> position

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:08.820 
sagging it always holds it in position

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:12.770 
sagging it always holds it in position
at<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.360> top<00:01:10.490> Arleen<00:01:11.490> also<00:01:11.939> suggested<00:01:12.570> just

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:12.780 
at the top Arleen also suggested just

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.570 
at the top Arleen also suggested just
covering<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.320> window<00:01:13.619> area<00:01:13.830> and<00:01:13.950> not<00:01:14.400> the

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
covering the window area and not the

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:17.060 
covering the window area and not the
sides<00:01:14.820> and<00:01:15.210> using<00:01:15.810> a<00:01:15.869> dramatic<00:01:16.320> fabric<00:01:16.740> design

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:17.070 
sides and using a dramatic fabric design

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.789 
sides and using a dramatic fabric design
the<00:01:18.060> stripe<00:01:18.390> runs<00:01:18.810> up<00:01:19.020> and<00:01:19.200> down<00:01:19.409> on<00:01:19.619> your

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
the stripe runs up and down on your

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.010 
the stripe runs up and down on your
vault<00:01:20.070> but<00:01:20.670> we<00:01:20.820> chose<00:01:21.119> to<00:01:21.479> run<00:01:21.720> it<00:01:21.900> the

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
vault but we chose to run it the

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.800 
vault but we chose to run it the
opposite<00:01:22.590> direction<00:01:23.009> we<00:01:23.460> railroaded<00:01:24.150> it<00:01:24.330> to

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
opposite direction we railroaded it to

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:27.469 
opposite direction we railroaded it to
get<00:01:25.470> your<00:01:25.650> full<00:01:25.950> impact<00:01:26.670> of<00:01:26.939> your<00:01:27.150> stripes

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
get your full impact of your stripes

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.600 
get your full impact of your stripes
when<00:01:28.229> you<00:01:28.380> pleat<00:01:28.950> stripes<00:01:29.700> like<00:01:30.659> this<00:01:31.610> you

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:32.610 
when you pleat stripes like this you

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.520 
when you pleat stripes like this you
wouldn't<00:01:32.909> have<00:01:33.180> a<00:01:33.320> consistency<00:01:34.320> in<00:01:34.500> your

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
wouldn't have a consistency in your

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.999 
wouldn't have a consistency in your
pattern<00:01:35.280> and<00:01:35.600> you<00:01:36.600> lose<00:01:36.780> a<00:01:36.810> lot<00:01:37.140> of<00:01:37.170> the<00:01:37.409> lot<00:01:37.890> of

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
pattern and you lose a lot of the lot of

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.609 
pattern and you lose a lot of the lot of
the<00:01:38.100> color<00:01:38.310> too<00:01:38.820> you<00:01:39.210> lose<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.659> impact<00:01:40.049> of<00:01:40.409> the

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
the color too you lose the impact of the

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:42.170 
the color too you lose the impact of the
whole<00:01:40.829> thing<00:01:41.130> when<00:01:41.430> you<00:01:41.520> do<00:01:41.670> it<00:01:41.759> that<00:01:41.790> way

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
whole thing when you do it that way

running<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.229> stripes<00:01:43.530> horizontally<00:01:44.310> will

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
running the stripes horizontally will

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.520 
running the stripes horizontally will
also<00:01:44.850> widen<00:01:45.299> the<00:01:45.390> feel<00:01:45.720> of<00:01:45.990> the<00:01:46.079> trailer<00:01:46.320> and
