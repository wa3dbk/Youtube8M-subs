able<00:00:38.170> to<00:00:38.350> get<00:00:38.620> a<00:00:38.890> more<00:00:39.400> accurate<00:00:39.580> reading<00:00:41.040> if<00:00:42.040> i

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:42.940 
able to get a more accurate reading if i

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.720 
able to get a more accurate reading if i
did<00:00:43.120> a<00:00:43.150> count<00:00:43.680> so<00:00:44.680> I'm<00:00:44.830> doing<00:00:45.010> a<00:00:45.190> 10<00:00:45.430> minute

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:45.730 
did a count so I'm doing a 10 minute

did a count so I'm doing a 10 minute
count<00:00:46.000> I'm<00:00:47.010> background<00:00:48.010> and<00:00:48.370> then<00:00:48.640> a<00:00:48.670> 10

point<00:01:53.020> for<00:01:53.410> 13<00:01:54.190> is<00:01:54.550> is<00:01:55.030> the<00:01:55.750> high<00:01:55.960> that<00:01:56.740> I<00:01:56.770> got

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.130 
point for 13 is is the high that I got

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.840 
point for 13 is is the high that I got
on<00:01:57.430> the<00:01:57.720> microsieverts<00:01:58.720> an<00:01:59.050> hour<00:01:59.350> and<00:01:59.850> usually

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:03.070 
on the background that would be at about

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:07.560 
on the background that would be at about
point<00:02:03.870> 100<00:02:05.220> so<00:02:06.220> it<00:02:06.400> did<00:02:06.550> actually<00:02:06.730> go<00:02:07.090> fallout

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:07.570

hi<00:03:36.290> there's<00:03:37.290> my<00:03:37.440> average<00:03:40.100> that's<00:03:42.830> what<00:03:43.830> it

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:43.860 
hi there's my average that's what it

00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:45.140 
hi there's my average that's what it
looks<00:03:43.950> like<00:03:44.310> and<00:03:44.640> as<00:03:44.880> you<00:03:45.000> can<00:03:45.120> see

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
looks like and as you can see

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:49.780 
looks like and as you can see
everything's<00:03:45.780> towards<00:03:46.230> the<00:03:46.350> bottom

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:49.790 

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:54.340 

everything's<00:03:50.790> down<00:03:50.970> at<00:03:51.150> the<00:03:51.240> bottom<00:03:53.270> alright

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:54.350 
everything's down at the bottom alright

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:57.230 
everything's down at the bottom alright
957<00:03:55.350> is<00:03:55.710> with<00:03:55.920> the<00:03:56.100> high<00:03:56.220> count<00:03:56.610> I<00:03:56.760> got<00:03:57.000> on<00:03:57.210> the

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:57.240 
957 is with the high count I got on the

00:03:57.240 --> 00:04:02.620 
957 is with the high count I got on the
salmon<00:03:58.160> so<00:03:59.160> that<00:03:59.370> is<00:03:59.550> at<00:03:59.970> least<00:04:00.320> doubled

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:02.630 
salmon so that is at least doubled

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:08.060 
salmon so that is at least doubled
almost<00:04:03.630> triple<00:04:04.170> the<00:04:04.850> background<00:04:05.850> on<00:04:07.070> the

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:08.070 
almost triple the background on the

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:14.180 
almost triple the background on the
total<00:04:09.060> count

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:14.190 

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:16.550 

so<00:04:14.820> to<00:04:14.880> me<00:04:15.090> it<00:04:15.390> looks<00:04:15.630> obvious<00:04:15.930> that<00:04:16.350> it's

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:16.560 
so to me it looks obvious that it's

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.789 
so to me it looks obvious that it's
showing<00:04:17.100> something<00:04:17.430> is<00:04:17.850> in<00:04:18.120> the<00:04:18.330> fish<00:04:18.799> because

00:04:19.789 --> 00:04:19.799 
showing something is in the fish because

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:22.490 
showing something is in the fish because
if<00:04:20.040> you<00:04:20.160> look<00:04:20.310> at<00:04:20.459> the<00:04:20.489> background<00:04:21.090> all<00:04:22.019> the

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:22.500 
if you look at the background all the

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:26.180 
if you look at the background all the
bottom<00:04:22.830> readings<00:04:23.220> are<00:04:23.340> to<00:04:23.490> the<00:04:23.610> bottom<00:04:24.000> and<00:04:25.190> on

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
bottom readings are to the bottom and on

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:28.990 
bottom readings are to the bottom and on
the<00:04:26.340> salmon<00:04:26.700> itself<00:04:26.850> they're<00:04:27.510> all<00:04:27.770> averaged

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:29.000 
the salmon itself they're all averaged

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.920 
the salmon itself they're all averaged
above<00:04:30.000> the<00:04:30.300> bottoms

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:34.930 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:38.379 

here<00:04:35.930> are<00:04:36.260> the<00:04:36.530> three<00:04:37.120> background<00:04:38.120> reading

00:04:38.379 --> 00:04:38.389 
here are the three background reading

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:45.100 
here are the three background reading
charts<00:04:39.610> here's<00:04:40.610> the<00:04:40.699> second<00:04:43.840> here's<00:04:44.840> the

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:45.110 
charts here's the second here's the

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:50.890 
charts here's the second here's the
third<00:04:46.570> and<00:04:47.570> now<00:04:48.380> if<00:04:48.500> you<00:04:48.620> notice<00:04:49.510> this<00:04:50.510> is<00:04:50.570> the

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:50.900 
third and now if you notice this is the

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:55.300 
third and now if you notice this is the
first<00:04:51.139> of<00:04:51.410> the<00:04:51.710> salmon<00:04:53.530> here's<00:04:54.530> the<00:04:54.800> second

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:55.310 
first of the salmon here's the second

00:04:55.310 --> 00:05:00.400 
first of the salmon here's the second
see<00:04:56.240> how<00:04:56.389> it<00:04:56.540> went<00:04:56.810> way<00:04:57.050> busy<00:04:58.930> and<00:04:59.930> there's<00:05:00.169> the

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:00.410 
see how it went way busy and there's the

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:06.540 
see how it went way busy and there's the
third<00:05:01.150> those<00:05:02.150> are<00:05:02.360> the<00:05:02.389> charts<00:05:02.780> that<00:05:02.870> I<00:05:03.020> saved

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:06.550 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:09.909 

so<00:05:07.550> that's<00:05:07.790> my<00:05:07.970> conclusion<00:05:08.210> is<00:05:08.810> that<00:05:09.560> it's

00:05:09.909 --> 00:05:09.919 
so that's my conclusion is that it's

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:12.480 
so that's my conclusion is that it's
picking<00:05:10.310> up<00:05:10.430> something<00:05:10.790> I<00:05:11.180> don't<00:05:11.540> know<00:05:11.630> what

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:12.490 
picking up something I don't know what

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:16.090 
picking up something I don't know what
specific<00:05:13.490> isotope<00:05:14.090> it<00:05:14.270> is<00:05:14.530> but<00:05:15.530> I<00:05:15.560> believe

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:16.100 
specific isotope it is but I believe

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:18.879 
specific isotope it is but I believe
that<00:05:16.520> there<00:05:16.790> is<00:05:16.820> radiation<00:05:17.810> in<00:05:18.020> the<00:05:18.080> salmon

00:05:18.879 --> 00:05:18.889 
that there is radiation in the salmon

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:30.090 
that there is radiation in the salmon
and<00:05:19.930> it's<00:05:20.930> boiled<00:05:25.240> background<00:05:27.639> salmon

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:30.100 
and it's boiled background salmon

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:37.290 
and it's boiled background salmon
