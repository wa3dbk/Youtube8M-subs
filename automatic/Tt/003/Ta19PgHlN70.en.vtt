00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:19.219 

but<00:05:15.930> I<00:05:16.340> guess<00:05:17.340> this<00:05:17.520> is<00:05:17.699> a<00:05:18.139> action<00:05:19.139> the

00:05:19.219 --> 00:05:19.229 
but I guess this is a action the

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:21.469 
but I guess this is a action the
adventure<00:05:19.650> game<00:05:19.830> so<00:05:20.159> just<00:05:21.060> see<00:05:21.180> how<00:05:21.300> different

00:05:21.469 --> 00:05:21.479 
adventure game so just see how different

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:28.040 
adventure game so just see how different
it<00:05:21.720> is<00:05:21.750> on<00:05:22.020> the<00:05:22.310> projector

00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:28.050 

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:51.440 

if<00:05:28.229> no<00:05:28.470> idea<00:05:28.860> where<00:05:29.039> I'm<00:05:29.129> going<00:05:29.159> anymore

00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:51.450 

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:54.480 

overall<00:05:52.450> I<00:05:52.480> mean<00:05:52.960> if<00:05:53.080> you<00:05:53.200> want<00:05:53.410> to<00:05:53.560> use<00:05:54.310> this

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:54.490 
overall I mean if you want to use this

00:05:54.490 --> 00:06:00.660 
overall I mean if you want to use this
for<00:05:54.760> a<00:05:55.560> gaming<00:05:58.110> projector<00:05:59.110> I<00:05:59.140> guess<00:05:59.440> um<00:05:59.830> it'd

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:00.670 
for a gaming projector I guess um it'd

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:02.550 
for a gaming projector I guess um it'd
be<00:06:00.880> pretty<00:06:01.090> good<00:06:01.330> it's<00:06:01.780> actually<00:06:01.960> pretty<00:06:02.320> nice

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:02.560 
be pretty good it's actually pretty nice

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:04.740 
be pretty good it's actually pretty nice
I<00:06:03.550> don't<00:06:04.030> know<00:06:04.120> if<00:06:04.180> you<00:06:04.270> can<00:06:04.360> tell<00:06:04.480> that<00:06:04.540> on

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:04.750 
I don't know if you can tell that on

00:06:04.750 --> 00:06:06.900 
I don't know if you can tell that on
camera<00:06:05.020> not<00:06:05.320> but<00:06:05.560> it's<00:06:06.100> really<00:06:06.400> nice<00:06:06.550> here<00:06:06.790> in

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:06.910 
camera not but it's really nice here in

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:11.220 
camera not but it's really nice here in
person<00:06:07.300> um<00:06:07.770> as<00:06:09.390> you<00:06:10.390> would<00:06:10.510> know<00:06:10.660> low<00:06:10.960> light

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:11.230 
person um as you would know low light

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:16.890 
person um as you would know low light
works<00:06:11.680> the<00:06:11.890> best<00:06:12.070> and<00:06:12.400> I<00:06:14.910> guess<00:06:15.910> when<00:06:16.510> they<00:06:16.690> ask

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:16.900 
works the best and I guess when they ask

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:19.410 
works the best and I guess when they ask
you<00:06:17.140> to<00:06:17.170> adjust<00:06:17.650> colors<00:06:18.430> and<00:06:18.730> stuff<00:06:18.910> as<00:06:19.210> they

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:19.420 
you to adjust colors and stuff as they

00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:22.410 
you to adjust colors and stuff as they

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:22.420 
do on this game in various other games

00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:24.960 
do on this game in various other games
make<00:06:23.170> sure<00:06:23.200> you<00:06:23.560> toggle<00:06:24.520> through<00:06:24.700> those

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:24.970 
make sure you toggle through those

00:06:24.970 --> 00:06:27.570 
make sure you toggle through those
options<00:06:25.570> see<00:06:25.900> how<00:06:26.440> keen<00:06:26.650> how<00:06:27.040> you<00:06:27.100> can<00:06:27.490> adjust

00:06:27.570 --> 00:06:27.580

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:30.330 
options see how keen how you can adjust
colors<00:06:28.180> because<00:06:28.510> sometimes<00:06:29.190> projector<00:06:30.190> is

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:30.340 
colors because sometimes projector is

00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:32.400 
colors because sometimes projector is
actually<00:06:30.670> a<00:06:30.700> little<00:06:30.820> too<00:06:31.120> great<00:06:31.480> you<00:06:32.260> might
