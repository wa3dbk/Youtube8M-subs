large bone from an animal and they
pretty<00:01:51.659> much<00:01:51.750> just<00:01:52.520> stroke<00:01:53.520> it<00:01:53.549> along<00:01:54.240> the

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
pretty much just stroke it along the

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.550 
pretty much just stroke it along the
entire<00:01:55.409> length<00:01:56.130> of<00:01:56.430> the<00:01:56.549> bat<00:01:56.759> and<00:01:57.409> what<00:01:58.409> that

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
entire length of the bat and what that

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.270 
entire length of the bat and what that
does<00:01:58.770> is<00:01:59.070> it<00:01:59.430> compresses<00:01:59.880> all<00:02:00.270> the<00:02:01.280> little

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
does is it compresses all the little

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.179 
does is it compresses all the little
pores<00:02:02.579> and<00:02:02.939> the<00:02:03.659> holes<00:02:03.869> in<00:02:04.049> the<00:02:04.140> wood<00:02:04.320> which

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
pores and the holes in the wood which

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:08.270 
pores and the holes in the wood which
make<00:02:05.430> it<00:02:05.640> smoother<00:02:06.360> and<00:02:06.600> a<00:02:07.049> lot<00:02:07.200> harder<00:02:07.439> and<00:02:07.560> a

00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:08.280 
make it smoother and a lot harder and a

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.260 
make it smoother and a lot harder and a
lot<00:02:08.819> a<00:02:09.410> lot<00:02:10.410> more<00:02:10.649> water<00:02:10.890> resistant<00:02:11.459> than

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:12.270 
lot a lot more water resistant than

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:13.670 
lot a lot more water resistant than
other<00:02:12.750> bats<00:02:13.050> so

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
other bats so

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.490 
other bats so
it's<00:02:14.459> really<00:02:14.640> nice<00:02:14.849> right<00:02:15.629> here<00:02:15.780> I<00:02:16.170> have<00:02:16.470> a

33-inch
and<00:02:19.500> there's<00:02:19.769> really<00:02:19.980> straight<00:02:20.250> grains<00:02:20.519> by

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
and there's really straight grains by

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.390 
and there's really straight grains by
the<00:02:20.790> way<00:02:20.909> any<00:02:21.120> merch<00:02:21.510> you<00:02:21.780> get<00:02:22.079> the<00:02:23.010> green<00:02:23.220> lid

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400
