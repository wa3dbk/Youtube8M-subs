so<00:02:13.310> now<00:02:13.489> that<00:02:13.579> I've<00:02:13.760> cut<00:02:14.030> this<00:02:14.209> one<00:02:14.420> off<00:02:14.799> oops

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:17.829 

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:21.309 

so<00:02:18.829> now<00:02:18.980> I've<00:02:19.189> cut<00:02:19.459> this<00:02:19.730> edge<00:02:20.030> off<00:02:20.390> so<00:02:20.780> I'm

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319 
so now I've cut this edge off so I'm

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:23.110 
so now I've cut this edge off so I'm
just<00:02:21.530> going<00:02:21.709> to<00:02:21.920> go<00:02:22.069> ahead<00:02:22.159> and<00:02:22.519> cut<00:02:22.760> that<00:02:22.909> off

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:23.120 
just going to go ahead and cut that off

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:30.069 
just going to go ahead and cut that off
of<00:02:23.329> my<00:02:23.480> chain<00:02:23.780> because<00:02:24.709> I<00:02:24.739> can't<00:02:25.129> use<00:02:25.400> that<00:02:29.079> and

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:30.079 
of my chain because I can't use that and

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:33.899 
of my chain because I can't use that and
just<00:02:30.349> set<00:02:30.500> that<00:02:30.650> aside

00:02:33.899 --> 00:02:33.909 

00:02:33.909 --> 00:02:38.199 

so<00:02:34.909> now<00:02:35.799> lining<00:02:36.799> it<00:02:37.010> up<00:02:37.069> I<00:02:37.250> have<00:02:37.459> one<00:02:37.819> two<00:02:38.180> three

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209 
so now lining it up I have one two three

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:41.770 
so now lining it up I have one two three
four<00:02:38.750> five<00:02:39.560> six<00:02:40.010> seven<00:02:40.549> so<00:02:41.239> I<00:02:41.299> have<00:02:41.420> one<00:02:41.599> extra

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
four five six seven so I have one extra

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:43.149 
four five six seven so I have one extra
one<00:02:42.109> there<00:02:42.260> so<00:02:42.379> I'm<00:02:42.470> just<00:02:42.590> going<00:02:42.709> to<00:02:42.799> cut<00:02:43.010> that

00:02:43.149 --> 00:02:43.159 
one there so I'm just going to cut that

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:46.000 
one there so I'm just going to cut that
guy<00:02:43.370> off<00:02:43.400> and<00:02:43.909> again<00:02:44.780> cutting<00:02:45.260> off<00:02:45.470> that<00:02:45.500> loop

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:46.010 
guy off and again cutting off that loop

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:47.920 
guy off and again cutting off that loop
because<00:02:46.280> I<00:02:46.370> want<00:02:46.579> to<00:02:46.670> keep<00:02:46.819> my<00:02:47.090> seventh<00:02:47.540> stone

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:47.930 
because I want to keep my seventh stone

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:52.379 
because I want to keep my seventh stone
loop<00:02:48.440> intact<00:02:49.000> and<00:02:50.000> just<00:02:50.389> set<00:02:50.569> that<00:02:50.690> one<00:02:50.870> aside

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:52.389 
loop intact and just set that one aside

00:02:52.389 --> 00:02:55.479 
loop intact and just set that one aside
alright<00:02:53.389> so<00:02:53.599> now<00:02:53.750> we<00:02:53.810> can't<00:02:54.079> get<00:02:54.139> started<00:02:54.489> so

00:02:55.479 --> 00:02:55.489 
alright so now we can't get started so

00:02:55.489 --> 00:03:02.050 
alright so now we can't get started so
go<00:02:55.639> ahead<00:02:55.760> and<00:02:56.260> pick<00:02:57.260> up<00:02:57.409> one<00:02:57.650> jump<00:02:57.950> ring<00:03:01.060> and

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:02.060 
go ahead and pick up one jump ring and

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.390 
go ahead and pick up one jump ring and
we're<00:03:02.269> just<00:03:02.389> going<00:03:02.599> to<00:03:02.629> use<00:03:02.870> our<00:03:03.620> pliers<00:03:04.040> to

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
we're just going to use our pliers to

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.660 
we're just going to use our pliers to
open<00:03:04.430> it<00:03:05.799> and<00:03:06.799> you're<00:03:07.010> just<00:03:07.159> going<00:03:07.280> to<00:03:07.310> open<00:03:07.370> it

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670 
open it and you're just going to open it

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:09.879 
open it and you're just going to open it
just<00:03:07.700> as<00:03:07.970> you<00:03:08.090> would<00:03:08.120> another<00:03:08.450> jump<00:03:08.870> ring<00:03:08.930> and

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:09.889 
just as you would another jump ring and

00:03:09.889 --> 00:03:12.479 
just as you would another jump ring and
we're<00:03:10.159> going<00:03:10.370> to<00:03:10.430> first<00:03:10.760> loop<00:03:11.359> on<00:03:11.599> our<00:03:11.870> large

00:03:12.479 --> 00:03:12.489 
we're going to first loop on our large

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:16.000 
we're going to first loop on our large
crystal<00:03:13.489> pure<00:03:13.760> drop<00:03:13.939> pendant<00:03:14.420> and<00:03:14.889> taking<00:03:15.889> our

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:16.010 
crystal pure drop pendant and taking our

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:17.530 
crystal pure drop pendant and taking our
longer<00:03:16.430> lengths<00:03:16.669> are<00:03:16.910> three<00:03:17.269> and<00:03:17.359> a<00:03:17.419> quarter

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:17.540 
longer lengths are three and a quarter

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:20.439 
longer lengths are three and a quarter
inches<00:03:17.859> we're<00:03:18.859> going<00:03:19.069> to<00:03:19.190> just<00:03:19.400> add<00:03:19.609> it<00:03:20.030> to<00:03:20.419> our

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:20.449 
inches we're going to just add it to our

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:23.520 
inches we're going to just add it to our
jump<00:03:20.780> ring<00:03:20.989> and<00:03:21.230> then<00:03:22.099> close<00:03:22.370> our<00:03:22.549> jump<00:03:22.730> ring

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
jump ring and then close our jump ring

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:29.339 
jump ring and then close our jump ring
very<00:03:24.530> simple<00:03:25.930> now<00:03:26.930> to<00:03:27.530> the<00:03:27.650> other<00:03:27.829> end<00:03:28.159> of<00:03:28.459> this

00:03:29.339 --> 00:03:29.349 
very simple now to the other end of this

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:32.770 
very simple now to the other end of this
chain<00:03:30.370> we're<00:03:31.370> going<00:03:31.579> to<00:03:31.730> take<00:03:31.940> our<00:03:32.180> two<00:03:32.480> feet

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
chain we're going to take our two feet

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:40.469 
chain we're going to take our two feet
of<00:03:33.019> cable<00:03:33.470> chain<00:03:34.419> using<00:03:35.419> another<00:03:35.690> jump<00:03:36.019> ring

00:03:40.469 --> 00:03:40.479 

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:46.089 

just<00:03:41.479> open<00:03:41.840> that<00:03:41.870> jump<00:03:42.260> ring<00:03:42.699> and<00:03:44.079> loop<00:03:45.079> on<00:03:45.290> the

00:03:46.089 --> 00:03:46.099 
just open that jump ring and loop on the

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:52.300 
just open that jump ring and loop on the
chain<00:03:46.370> and<00:03:47.620> now<00:03:48.620> our<00:03:48.979> gemstone<00:03:49.669> chain<00:03:51.310> and

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 
chain and now our gemstone chain and

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:57.809 
chain and now our gemstone chain and
close<00:03:52.549> that<00:03:52.790> up

00:03:57.809 --> 00:03:57.819 

00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:02.550 

so<00:03:58.659> I<00:03:58.719> have<00:03:58.989> this<00:03:59.739> part<00:04:00.129> attached<00:04:00.610> to<00:04:01.379> the<00:04:02.379> that

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
so I have this part attached to the that

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.770 
so I have this part attached to the that
around<00:04:02.769> this<00:04:03.310> part<00:04:03.640> attached<00:04:04.000> to<00:04:04.269> the<00:04:04.390> entire

length of chain with our two feet and

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.640 
length of chain with our two feet and
I'm<00:04:07.510> just<00:04:07.629> going<00:04:07.780> to<00:04:07.810> move<00:04:08.049> to<00:04:08.230> the<00:04:08.349> other<00:04:08.379> side

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:08.650 
I'm just going to move to the other side

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:12.119 
I'm just going to move to the other side
of<00:04:09.010> this<00:04:09.129> chain<00:04:10.019> take<00:04:11.019> my<00:04:11.260> last<00:04:11.560> jump<00:04:11.890> ring

of this chain take my last jump ring

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:18.240 
of this chain take my last jump ring
open<00:04:13.890> it<00:04:14.890> up<00:04:15.010> and<00:04:16.019> now<00:04:17.019> I'm<00:04:17.350> going<00:04:17.769> to<00:04:17.919> hook<00:04:18.039> on

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:18.250 
open it up and now I'm going to hook on

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:20.999 
open it up and now I'm going to hook on
three<00:04:18.850> things<00:04:19.150> here<00:04:19.509> I'm<00:04:20.109> going<00:04:20.470> to<00:04:20.650> hook<00:04:20.799> on

three things here I'm going to hook on

00:04:21.009 --> 00:04:26.129 
three things here I'm going to hook on
my<00:04:21.549> chain<00:04:21.880> first<00:04:23.970> just<00:04:24.970> take<00:04:25.419> the<00:04:25.600> last<00:04:25.780> link

00:04:26.129 --> 00:04:26.139 
my chain first just take the last link

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:28.830 
my chain first just take the last link
in<00:04:26.259> that<00:04:26.289> chain<00:04:26.440> and<00:04:27.240> now<00:04:28.240> I'm<00:04:28.449> going<00:04:28.630> to<00:04:28.750> hook

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:28.840 
in that chain and now I'm going to hook

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:34.499 
in that chain and now I'm going to hook
on<00:04:29.050> one<00:04:29.440> loop<00:04:29.740> and<00:04:32.190> take<00:04:33.190> the<00:04:33.370> other<00:04:33.400> end<00:04:33.639> fold

on one loop and take the other end fold

00:04:34.509 --> 00:04:37.050 
on one loop and take the other end fold
it<00:04:34.720> up<00:04:34.900> and<00:04:35.370> you're<00:04:36.370> just<00:04:36.490> going<00:04:36.639> to<00:04:36.699> make<00:04:36.880> a

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:37.060 
it up and you're just going to make a

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:40.890 
it up and you're just going to make a
nice<00:04:37.240> little<00:04:37.509> loop<00:04:37.810> there<00:04:37.840> and<00:04:38.789> now<00:04:39.789> just<00:04:40.599> take

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:40.900 
nice little loop there and now just take

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:44.719 
nice little loop there and now just take
your<00:04:40.930> plier<00:04:41.320> and<00:04:41.610> close<00:04:42.610> that<00:04:42.849> jump<00:04:43.060> ring<00:04:43.710> and

your plier and close that jump ring and

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:48.990 
your plier and close that jump ring and
now<00:04:45.729> to<00:04:46.240> put<00:04:46.449> it<00:04:46.479> together<00:04:46.720> in<00:04:47.470> our<00:04:47.680> length<00:04:48.000> you

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:49.000 
now to put it together in our length you

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.710 
now to put it together in our length you
just<00:04:49.240> thread<00:04:49.930> your<00:04:50.139> crystal<00:04:50.650> pendant<00:04:51.720> down

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:52.720 
just thread your crystal pendant down

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:55.350 
just thread your crystal pendant down
through<00:04:52.990> the<00:04:53.110> loop<00:04:53.289> and<00:04:54.060> there<00:04:55.060> is<00:04:55.210> your
