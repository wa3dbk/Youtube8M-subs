00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:08.100
 your eyes welcome to another guide more than 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:11.759
 dragon city we could say that this is 

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:14.280
 The Ultimate Guide to the attacks as 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:17.310
 we have finally arrived finally we have 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.650
 come to attacks of legendary type 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.900
 the dragons of legend let's type 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:25.619
 see what their attacks are finally 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:30.160
 expected so much for this moment and good 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:32.200
 and a lot of emotion from me and esque 

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.330
 this time instead of starting to talk about 

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.640
 comments on other things first 

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:38.980
 I will do the guide and in the end I will 

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.379
 make related comments about 

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:43.140
 these guides and what is next 

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:45.989
 it comes like that is what 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.660
 I'm going to talk to talk to you about the same thing 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:50.190
 that I always speak because if you are a 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.829
 new person you're seeing this 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:56.190
 video I want to clarify you once 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:58.260
 this guide to see take away everything that those 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.870
 guides are based at the center 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.360
 I train 

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:04.879
 which you can not because you can put it to 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:07.580
 level 20 and it takes 6 hours when what 

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:09.650
 you can occupy and so that you can 

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:13.759
 send a dragon to train that dragon 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:15.740
 they need to be level 15 forcibly and 

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:18.890
 for your dragon to reach level 15 

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:21.320
 you must have the magical temple that makes 

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.479
 that the dragons reach that level and 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:26.619
 already once doing that you can put 

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:26.619
 any dragon to train 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:32.790
 selection is a dragon explain here you 

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:34.440
 attacks come out that you can train and 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:39.840
 the exchanges for another I'm going to look 

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:41.670
 one that is not there selected 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:43.720
 today we are going to see now down down below 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.940
 down 

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.870
 namely the archangel if he has something good 

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:51.020
 what to give us 

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:52.880
 like this we can make it timeless and 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.820
 we select we change it for another 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.450
 attack and with that would be the whole thing 

00:01:55.820 --> 00:01:59.690
 fixed up 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:02.000
 so it's good now I'm going to move on to a 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:04.400
 small transition or a few small clips 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.930
 video where I show what are the 

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:10.430
 These attacks east of this that 

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:14.060
 let's talk in this guide that are from 

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:16.370
 the legend types and then after that 

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:18.920
 we will explain how the 

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:20.630
 base years and the time they take 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.180
 train because all the attacks are 

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:26.920
 endearing nothing more than in some 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:30.040
 cases in this 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:32.709
 takes longer or takes less depending on the 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:35.200
 attack that is and I will make the cut 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:36.520
 because the dog that is always by 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.250
 there is already starting to scream like 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:42.580
 a whole girl and well, well, I go 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:44.440
 today here the cut and we continue in a 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.800
 moment so I hope you like the 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.800
 attacks 

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:31.830
 well guys we have already returned after 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:33.840
 of having seen the clips or shorts of 

00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:37.410
 the attacks of the dragons now we go 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:41.070
 to go on to explain how it works 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:44.430
 the portrait I have the ones that I consider 

00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:46.680
 they are the worst and clear are the 

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.160
 that have the category as trainable 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:52.000
 but 

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:53.950
 all these attacks are trainable and 

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.320
 let's see that the wind attack 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:58.690
 legendary has an attack of some 

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:01.330
 attack based on 550 and taken 

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:04.180
 embrace to train also that the attack 

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:08.410
 of paralysis has a base attack 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:10.690
 650 and it takes 12 hours to train and 

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:12.490
 finally on this side we will see that 

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:15.280
 the attack of the rainbow has an attack 

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:18.100
 of 1,050 and it also takes 12 hours in 

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:21.160
 train yourself and now let's move on to 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:23.380
 explain these that I consider myself or what 

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:25.420
 I really think they are the best 

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:27.850
 now they will notice according to the 

00:04:25.420 --> 00:04:29.330
 base damage than the aurora attack 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:36.199
 Boreal 

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:38.689
 it has a base damage of 2,100 and takes 24 

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:40.759
 hours in training and that the attack of 

00:04:38.689 --> 00:04:43.759
 legendary spell has an attack to 

00:04:40.759 --> 00:04:46.129
 base of 2300 and it takes 48 hours in 

00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:48.139
 train once we've seen 

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:51.020
 we can say that we have concluded 

00:04:48.139 --> 00:04:53.150
 see all these attacks or all of these 

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:56.300
 guides about the attacks and I hope that they 

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:57.650
 have been very useful and we are going to 

00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:59.449
 begin to explain a little of what 

00:04:57.650 --> 00:05:02.379
 let's do it soon I'm going to 

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:02.379
 explain the table 

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:09.540
 of life of the dragons and I will move to 

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:11.130
 make an explanation of what the 

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:14.130
 best dragons according to their 

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:17.970
 category without training and then we're going to 

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:19.460
 see some guides which are the best 

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:22.819
 dragons 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:25.639
 by element with what he had been doing 

00:05:22.819 --> 00:05:27.620
 your best trained attacks and good 

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:30.590
 Well, I think it would be all for this 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:32.300
 guide I hope I look forward to and 

00:05:30.590 --> 00:05:34.789
 enthusiasm the next guides that will 

00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:36.979
 come I have already written down everything or the 

00:05:34.789 --> 00:05:38.710
 majority and well I think they are going to be

 good guides 

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:42.700
