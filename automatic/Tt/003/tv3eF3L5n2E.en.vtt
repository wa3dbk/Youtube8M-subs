think
so<00:02:13.810> when<00:02:13.900> I<00:02:13.960> further<00:02:14.260> new<00:02:14.650> let's<00:02:15.220> go<00:02:15.340> down<00:02:15.460> this

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 
so when I further new let's go down this

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.180 
so when I further new let's go down this
list<00:02:15.730> so<00:02:16.030> the<00:02:16.630> reason<00:02:16.870> why<00:02:17.170> I<00:02:17.200> realized<00:02:18.010> he's

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.190 
list so the reason why I realized he's

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.910 
list so the reason why I realized he's
invincible<00:02:18.460> it's<00:02:19.180> because<00:02:19.660> I<00:02:19.990> he<00:02:20.620> doesn't

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:20.920 
invincible it's because I he doesn't

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.680 
invincible it's because I he doesn't
actually<00:02:21.010> get<00:02:21.220> wished<00:02:21.490> back<00:02:21.730> in<00:02:22.060> the<00:02:22.540> upcoming

movie what happens is they wish back
just<00:02:24.820> his<00:02:24.940> body<00:02:25.390> but<00:02:25.990> his<00:02:26.080> body<00:02:26.380> seems<00:02:26.890> to<00:02:26.980> be

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
just his body but his body seems to be

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.220 
just his body but his body seems to be
alive<00:02:27.550> in<00:02:27.820> the<00:02:28.030> manga<00:02:28.240> panel<00:02:28.690> when<00:02:28.870> he<00:02:28.990> you

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:29.230 
alive in the manga panel when he you

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:30.420 
alive in the manga panel when he you
know<00:02:29.350> when<00:02:29.470> he<00:02:29.530> scattered<00:02:29.920> around<00:02:30.010> them<00:02:30.280> and

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
know when he scattered around them and

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:31.770 
know when he scattered around them and
the<00:02:30.700> reason<00:02:30.910> why<00:02:30.970> they<00:02:31.030> came<00:02:31.180> rushing<00:02:31.480> back<00:02:31.510> is

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:31.780 
the reason why they came rushing back is

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:34.050 
the reason why they came rushing back is
because<00:02:31.900> Shenron<00:02:32.500> says<00:02:32.710> that<00:02:32.920> his<00:02:33.700> body's

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:34.060 
because Shenron says that his body's

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.370 
because Shenron says that his body's
been<00:02:34.210> torn<00:02:34.420> up<00:02:34.510> into<00:02:34.630> so<00:02:34.810> many<00:02:34.870> pieces<00:02:34.990> that

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:37.410 
been torn up into so many pieces that
you<00:02:35.620> can't<00:02:35.950> bring<00:02:36.070> back<00:02:36.130> his<00:02:36.340> soul<00:02:36.610> so<00:02:37.090> instead

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420

pretty he's pretty he's pretty
invincible<00:02:59.890> and<00:02:59.950> I<00:03:00.040> when<00:03:00.160> he<00:03:00.220> looked<00:03:00.400> back<00:03:00.459> at

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:00.610 
invincible and I when he looked back at

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:03.990 
invincible and I when he looked back at
all<00:03:00.850> the<00:03:00.940> evidence<00:03:01.209> in<00:03:01.660> his<00:03:01.870> history<00:03:03.000> starting

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:04.000 
all the evidence in his history starting

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.610 
all the evidence in his history starting
with<00:03:04.120> plan<00:03:04.330> name<00:03:04.510> it<00:03:04.660> so<00:03:04.870> the<00:03:05.170> first<00:03:05.380> time<00:03:05.500> we

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
with plan name it so the first time we

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:07.260 
with plan name it so the first time we
saw<00:03:05.770> his<00:03:05.890> durability<00:03:06.100> but<00:03:06.760> obviously<00:03:07.150> when

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:07.270 
saw his durability but obviously when

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:09.480 
saw his durability but obviously when
his<00:03:07.360> pale<00:03:07.570> got<00:03:07.690> cut<00:03:07.870> off<00:03:08.130> didn't<00:03:09.130> bother<00:03:09.250> me<00:03:09.370> at

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:09.490 
his pale got cut off didn't bother me at

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:11.310 
his pale got cut off didn't bother me at
all<00:03:09.550> he<00:03:09.760> lost<00:03:09.940> his<00:03:10.120> tail<00:03:10.270> did<00:03:10.630> not<00:03:10.810> care<00:03:11.080> he<00:03:11.200> did

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:11.320 
all he lost his tail did not care he did

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
all he lost his tail did not care he did
probably<00:03:11.440> I'd<00:03:11.620> even<00:03:11.740> notice<00:03:11.950> his<00:03:12.070> tail<00:03:12.220> is

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:12.340 
probably I'd even notice his tail is

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:14.370 
probably I'd even notice his tail is
missing<00:03:12.670> probably<00:03:13.570> felt<00:03:13.720> no<00:03:13.900> pain<00:03:14.080> with<00:03:14.230> that

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:14.380 
missing probably felt no pain with that

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:16.710 
missing probably felt no pain with that
at<00:03:14.890> not<00:03:15.400> really<00:03:15.640> great<00:03:15.940> evidence<00:03:16.180> there<00:03:16.450> but

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
at not really great evidence there but

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.330 
at not really great evidence there but
his<00:03:16.840> time<00:03:17.020> I<00:03:17.110> throw<00:03:17.290> out<00:03:17.410> there<00:03:17.560> the<00:03:17.950> next<00:03:18.190> time

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:18.340 
his time I throw out there the next time

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.759 
his time I throw out there the next time
we<00:03:18.370> had<00:03:18.940> evidence<00:03:19.360> of<00:03:19.510> his<00:03:19.630> invincibility<00:03:20.080> was

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:20.769 
we had evidence of his invincibility was

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:22.620 
we had evidence of his invincibility was
when<00:03:21.160> he<00:03:21.370> got<00:03:21.459> shopped<00:03:21.850> in<00:03:22.030> half<00:03:22.209> I<00:03:22.360> was<00:03:22.510> on

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:22.630 
when he got shopped in half I was on

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:24.509 
when he got shopped in half I was on
attack<00:03:22.900> although<00:03:23.530> he<00:03:23.560> wasn't<00:03:23.890> a<00:03:24.070> ground<00:03:24.340> and

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:24.519 
attack although he wasn't a ground and

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:26.160 
attack although he wasn't a ground and
he<00:03:24.580> seems<00:03:24.880> to<00:03:24.970> be<00:03:25.000> pretty<00:03:25.209> much<00:03:25.360> in<00:03:25.480> pain<00:03:25.690> he

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 
he seems to be pretty much in pain he

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:28.020 
he seems to be pretty much in pain he
was<00:03:26.260> still<00:03:26.470> alive<00:03:26.709> and<00:03:27.010> you<00:03:27.280> know<00:03:27.400> it<00:03:27.580> didn't

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
was still alive and you know it didn't

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:29.400 
was still alive and you know it didn't
bother<00:03:28.150> me<00:03:28.330> he<00:03:28.510> was<00:03:28.630> missing<00:03:28.900> the<00:03:28.959> bottom<00:03:29.230> half

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:29.410 
bother me he was missing the bottom half

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:31.530

of his body and nobody got a lil bit of

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:33.210 
of his body and nobody got a lil bit of
energy<00:03:31.690> from<00:03:31.959> Goku<00:03:32.320> he<00:03:32.470> flew<00:03:32.769> up<00:03:32.950> and<00:03:32.980> start

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:33.220 
energy from Goku he flew up and start

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.100 
energy from Goku he flew up and start
floating<00:03:33.459> as<00:03:33.670> if<00:03:33.790> as<00:03:34.180> if<00:03:34.360> his<00:03:34.510> body<00:03:34.780> was<00:03:34.959> I<00:03:35.080> even

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:35.110 
floating as if as if his body was I even

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:37.380 
floating as if as if his body was I even
you<00:03:35.980> know<00:03:36.010> as<00:03:36.220> of<00:03:36.580> his<00:03:36.670> missing<00:03:36.970> body<00:03:37.150> wasn't

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:37.390 
you know as of his missing body wasn't

00:03:37.390 --> 00:03:39.060 
you know as of his missing body wasn't
even<00:03:37.510> a<00:03:37.630> problem<00:03:38.080> like<00:03:38.170> this<00:03:38.230> guy<00:03:38.560> was<00:03:38.800> still

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:39.070 
even a problem like this guy was still

00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:40.680 
even a problem like this guy was still
at<00:03:39.280> it<00:03:39.489> and<00:03:39.580> he's<00:03:39.760> 100-percent<00:03:40.120> go<00:03:40.420> in<00:03:40.540> and

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.690 
at it and he's 100-percent go in and

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:42.150 
at it and he's 100-percent go in and
fight<00:03:40.870> goku<00:03:41.050> and<00:03:41.200> of<00:03:41.320> course<00:03:41.500> he<00:03:41.590> tried<00:03:41.890> and

00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:42.160 
fight goku and of course he tried and

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:44.220 
fight goku and of course he tried and
then<00:03:42.580> ultimately<00:03:42.730> Goku<00:03:43.570> ended<00:03:43.870> up<00:03:43.989> destroying

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:44.230 
then ultimately Goku ended up destroying

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:46.620 
then ultimately Goku ended up destroying
him<00:03:44.590> with<00:03:44.680> his<00:03:44.799> angry<00:03:45.190> kamehameha<00:03:45.820> and<00:03:46.060> pretty

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:46.630 
him with his angry kamehameha and pretty

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:47.670 
him with his angry kamehameha and pretty
much<00:03:46.660> wrecked<00:03:46.959> him<00:03:47.080> on<00:03:47.200> top<00:03:47.380> of<00:03:47.500> that<00:03:47.560> the

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:47.680 
much wrecked him on top of that the

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.860 
much wrecked him on top of that the
plant<00:03:47.920> blew<00:03:48.100> up<00:03:48.250> and<00:03:48.430> he's<00:03:48.910> still<00:03:49.269> survived

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:49.870 
plant blew up and he's still survived

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:51.690 
plant blew up and he's still survived
which<00:03:50.530> is<00:03:50.650> my<00:03:50.739> next<00:03:50.920> evidence<00:03:51.280> when<00:03:51.400> he<00:03:51.489> was<00:03:51.580> in

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:51.700 
which is my next evidence when he was in

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.120 
which is my next evidence when he was in
space<00:03:52.030> he<00:03:52.570> was<00:03:52.690> by<00:03:52.900> was<00:03:53.140> literally<00:03:53.470> torn<00:03:53.799> up<00:03:53.950> he

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:54.130 
space he was by was literally torn up he

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:55.710 
space he was by was literally torn up he
was<00:03:54.250> even<00:03:54.430> missing<00:03:54.519> half<00:03:54.820> of<00:03:54.970> brand<00:03:55.269> he<00:03:55.540> was

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 
was even missing half of brand he was

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.360 
was even missing half of brand he was
completely<00:03:56.170> destroyed<00:03:56.620> I<00:03:56.890> mean<00:03:57.190> he<00:03:57.250> would

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370 
completely destroyed I mean he would

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:58.560 
completely destroyed I mean he would
think<00:03:57.549> someone<00:03:57.820> gets<00:03:58.000> shot<00:03:58.060> a<00:03:58.209> head<00:03:58.420> like<00:03:58.540> that

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:58.570 
think someone gets shot a head like that

00:03:58.570 --> 00:04:00.300 
think someone gets shot a head like that
they<00:03:58.959> pretty<00:03:59.110> much<00:03:59.230> died<00:03:59.530> but<00:03:59.769> freezing<00:04:00.160> now

00:04:00.300 --> 00:04:00.310 
they pretty much died but freezing now

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:01.380 
they pretty much died but freezing now
he<00:04:00.370> was<00:04:00.640> still<00:04:00.790> floating<00:04:01.030> he<00:04:01.180> was<00:04:01.299> just

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:01.390 
he was still floating he was just

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:03.120 
he was still floating he was just
waiting<00:04:01.540> for<00:04:01.930> somebody<00:04:02.650> to<00:04:02.799> pick<00:04:02.920> him<00:04:02.980> up

00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:03.130 
waiting for somebody to pick him up

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:05.970 
waiting for somebody to pick him up
that's<00:04:03.489> what<00:04:03.670> I'm<00:04:03.760> happening<00:04:04.209> when<00:04:04.980> his

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:05.980 
that's what I'm happening when his

00:04:05.980 --> 00:04:07.440 
that's what I'm happening when his
father<00:04:06.190> King<00:04:06.519> cold<00:04:06.760> and<00:04:06.970> a<00:04:07.000> cub<00:04:07.180> prix<00:04:07.360> the

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:07.450 
father King cold and a cub prix the

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:09.840 
father King cold and a cub prix the
soldiers<00:04:07.750> showed<00:04:07.930> up<00:04:08.080> and<00:04:08.290> basically<00:04:08.850> saved

00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:09.850 
soldiers showed up and basically saved

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:11.970 
soldiers showed up and basically saved
up<00:04:10.030> which<00:04:10.420> is<00:04:10.540> my<00:04:10.630> next<00:04:10.810> evidence<00:04:11.200> right<00:04:11.650> after

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:11.980 
up which is my next evidence right after

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:13.860 
up which is my next evidence right after
the<00:04:12.070> surgery<00:04:12.340> he<00:04:12.700> literally<00:04:13.060> gets<00:04:13.360> up<00:04:13.540> two

seconds<00:04:14.260> later<00:04:14.410> like<00:04:14.560> the<00:04:14.650> second<00:04:15.070> they

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:15.130 
seconds later like the second they

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:17.130 
seconds later like the second they
finish<00:04:15.459> reconstructing<00:04:16.150> his<00:04:16.570> body<00:04:16.810> he<00:04:16.959> gets

getting disintegrated which is what

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:40.900 
getting disintegrated which is what
kills<00:04:39.470> them<00:04:39.620> but<00:04:40.160> the<00:04:40.340> fact<00:04:40.490> that<00:04:40.610> he<00:04:40.700> gets

what may realize you know what this guy

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.600 
what may realize you know what this guy
is<00:04:44.150> very<00:04:44.450> durable<00:04:44.720> if<00:04:45.050> he<00:04:45.890> had<00:04:46.070> a<00:04:46.100> regeneration

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:46.610 
is very durable if he had a regeneration

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:48.430 
is very durable if he had a regeneration
power<00:04:46.910> or<00:04:47.120> if<00:04:47.270> it<00:04:47.360> was<00:04:47.420> immoral<00:04:47.720> he<00:04:48.320> would

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:48.440 
power or if it was immoral he would

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:49.930 
power or if it was immoral he would
seriously<00:04:48.710> be<00:04:48.920> probably<00:04:49.460> one<00:04:49.580> of<00:04:49.640> the<00:04:49.730> biggest

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:49.940 
seriously be probably one of the biggest

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:51.400 
seriously be probably one of the biggest
threats<00:04:50.360> in<00:04:50.480> the<00:04:50.540> entire<00:04:50.810> universe<00:04:51.140> just

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:51.410 
threats in the entire universe just

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:53.080 
threats in the entire universe just
because<00:04:51.740> you<00:04:52.280> know<00:04:52.370> he<00:04:52.460> had<00:04:52.580> that<00:04:52.670> one<00:04:52.880> flaw

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:53.090 
because you know he had that one flaw

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:55.890 
because you know he had that one flaw
where<00:04:53.270> he<00:04:53.330> just<00:04:53.480> can't<00:04:53.630> regenerate<00:04:54.220> so<00:04:55.220> uh

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:55.900 
where he just can't regenerate so uh

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:58.120 
where he just can't regenerate so uh

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:13.730 
and first of all he was cut in half then

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:15.280 
and first of all he was cut in half then
you<00:05:13.850> know<00:05:13.940> hit<00:05:14.180> by<00:05:14.330> Goku<00:05:14.750> with<00:05:14.900> that<00:05:15.050> angry

00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:17.330 
kamehameha wave yep then the planet

00:05:17.330 --> 00:05:19.600 
kamehameha wave yep then the planet
exploded<00:05:17.660> and<00:05:17.810> he<00:05:17.900> was<00:05:18.020> still<00:05:18.230> alive<00:05:18.610> even

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:19.610 
exploded and he was still alive even

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:20.920 
exploded and he was still alive even
with<00:05:19.730> like<00:05:19.850> a<00:05:19.880> chunk<00:05:20.240> taken<00:05:20.390> out<00:05:20.600> of<00:05:20.660> his<00:05:20.720> head

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:20.930 
with like a chunk taken out of his head

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:24.100 
with like a chunk taken out of his head
if<00:05:21.020> I<00:05:21.140> remember<00:05:21.560> now<00:05:22.510> what's<00:05:23.510> interesting<00:05:23.810> is

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:24.110 
if I remember now what's interesting is

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:25.480 
if I remember now what's interesting is
it<00:05:24.260> seems<00:05:24.530> a<00:05:24.650> little<00:05:24.800> strange<00:05:25.190> that<00:05:25.340> he

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:25.490 
it seems a little strange that he

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:27.280 
it seems a little strange that he
wouldn't<00:05:25.880> have<00:05:26.030> a<00:05:26.060> healing<00:05:26.540> factor<00:05:26.960> or<00:05:27.020> some

00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:27.290 
wouldn't have a healing factor or some

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:29.260 
wouldn't have a healing factor or some
sort<00:05:27.470> of<00:05:27.530> regeneration<00:05:28.070> even<00:05:28.670> if<00:05:28.790> you<00:05:28.910> know<00:05:29.030> he

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:29.270 
sort of regeneration even if you know he

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:31.540 
sort of regeneration even if you know he
is<00:05:29.390> so<00:05:29.660> durable<00:05:29.960> he<00:05:30.350> clearly<00:05:30.680> is<00:05:30.920> very<00:05:31.220> durable

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:31.550 
is so durable he clearly is very durable

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:34.720 
is so durable he clearly is very durable
and<00:05:31.910> I<00:05:32.780> mean<00:05:33.710> whether<00:05:33.860> or<00:05:34.010> not<00:05:34.100> just<00:05:34.430> part<00:05:34.700> of

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:34.730 
and I mean whether or not just part of

00:05:34.730 --> 00:05:36.430 
and I mean whether or not just part of
his<00:05:34.880> race<00:05:35.150> because<00:05:35.450> sands<00:05:35.780> are<00:05:36.050> definitely

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:36.440 
his race because sands are definitely

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:38.440 
his race because sands are definitely
more<00:05:36.560> durable<00:05:36.920> than<00:05:36.980> humans<00:05:37.430> I<00:05:37.550> would<00:05:37.730> say<00:05:37.940> a

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:38.450 
more durable than humans I would say a

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:41.290 
more durable than humans I would say a
general<00:05:39.380> basis<00:05:39.830> so<00:05:40.430> it's<00:05:40.850> definitely

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:41.300 
general basis so it's definitely

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:43.570 
general basis so it's definitely
interesting<00:05:41.540> part<00:05:42.350> of<00:05:42.410> his<00:05:42.530> Anatomy<00:05:42.620> because

00:05:43.570 --> 00:05:43.580 
interesting part of his Anatomy because

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:46.480 
interesting part of his Anatomy because
he<00:05:43.670> is<00:05:43.760> a<00:05:43.820> clone<00:05:44.120> of<00:05:44.230> King<00:05:45.230> cold<00:05:45.530> in<00:05:45.740> a<00:05:45.830> way<00:05:45.980> so

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:46.490 
he is a clone of King cold in a way so

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:49.480 
he is a clone of King cold in a way so
he<00:05:47.410> it's<00:05:48.410> definitely<00:05:48.680> interesting<00:05:49.070> you<00:05:49.340> have

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:49.490 
he it's definitely interesting you have

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:51.010 
he it's definitely interesting you have
many<00:05:49.760> good<00:05:49.940> points<00:05:50.180> there<00:05:50.360> especially<00:05:50.750> the

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:51.020 
many good points there especially the

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:52.930 
many good points there especially the
part<00:05:51.170> where<00:05:51.350> you<00:05:51.650> said<00:05:51.860> is<00:05:52.010> I<00:05:52.160> was<00:05:52.430> moving<00:05:52.700> in

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:52.940 
part where you said is I was moving in

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:56.020 
part where you said is I was moving in
that<00:05:53.060> manga<00:05:53.510> panel<00:05:53.810> right<00:05:54.020> yep<00:05:54.920> well<00:05:55.640> moving

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:56.030 
that manga panel right yep well moving

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:58.090 
that manga panel right yep well moving
it<00:05:56.090> was<00:05:56.180> like<00:05:56.540> open<00:05:56.930> it<00:05:57.080> look<00:05:57.470> like<00:05:57.680> it<00:05:57.920> had

00:05:58.090 --> 00:05:58.100 
it was like open it look like it had

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:00.760 
it was like open it look like it had
life<00:05:58.310> in<00:05:58.460> it<00:05:58.580> had<00:05:58.790> life<00:05:58.940> inside<00:05:59.240> okay<00:05:59.690> and<00:05:59.960> as

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:00.770 
life in it had life inside okay and as

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:03.040 
life in it had life inside okay and as
well<00:06:01.460> as<00:06:01.490> the<00:06:01.670> part<00:06:01.850> where<00:06:02.000> he<00:06:02.090> trunks<00:06:02.720> had<00:06:02.840> cut

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:03.050 
well as the part where he trunks had cut

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:06.160 
well as the part where he trunks had cut
him<00:06:03.170> up<00:06:03.320> now<00:06:04.190> what<00:06:04.700> I<00:06:04.730> find<00:06:05.240> interesting<00:06:05.540> is

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:06.170 
him up now what I find interesting is

00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:09.130 
him up now what I find interesting is
whether<00:06:06.560> or<00:06:06.680> not<00:06:06.860> that<00:06:07.220> is<00:06:07.280> for<00:06:07.910> a<00:06:08.180> more<00:06:08.900> of<00:06:09.020> a

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:09.140 
whether or not that is for a more of a

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:11.350 
whether or not that is for a more of a
dramatic<00:06:09.470> or<00:06:09.890> epic<00:06:10.250> effect<00:06:10.640> because<00:06:11.030> we<00:06:11.180> know

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:11.360 
dramatic or epic effect because we know

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:14.050 
dramatic or epic effect because we know
that<00:06:11.390> there's<00:06:12.230> a<00:06:12.290> lot<00:06:12.530> of<00:06:12.560> different<00:06:13.060> effects

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:14.060 
that there's a lot of different effects

00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:15.940 
that there's a lot of different effects
using<00:06:14.300> dragon<00:06:14.660> ball<00:06:14.930> to<00:06:15.170> display<00:06:15.710> certain

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:15.950 
using dragon ball to display certain

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:17.560 
using dragon ball to display certain
emotions<00:06:16.520> and<00:06:16.670> all<00:06:16.760> that<00:06:16.910> so<00:06:17.120> whether<00:06:17.330> or<00:06:17.450> not

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:17.570 
emotions and all that so whether or not

00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:20.080 
emotions and all that so whether or not
used<00:06:17.930> for<00:06:17.990> that<00:06:18.230> or<00:06:18.470> durability<00:06:19.130> is<00:06:19.610> unclear

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:20.090 
used for that or durability is unclear

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:21.610 
used for that or durability is unclear
but<00:06:20.210> you<00:06:20.360> have<00:06:20.480> plenty<00:06:20.780> of<00:06:20.900> good<00:06:21.080> points<00:06:21.290> is<00:06:21.500> to

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:21.620 
but you have plenty of good points is to

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:24.340 
but you have plenty of good points is to
support<00:06:22.550> the<00:06:22.730> fact<00:06:23.000> that<00:06:23.090> it<00:06:23.270> would<00:06:23.390> be<00:06:23.600> a<00:06:23.810> link

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:24.350 
support the fact that it would be a link

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:27.010 
support the fact that it would be a link
to<00:06:24.440> his<00:06:24.470> durability<00:06:24.890> in<00:06:25.220> some<00:06:25.430> way<00:06:25.580> yep<00:06:26.540> but

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:27.020 
to his durability in some way yep but

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:28.420 
to his durability in some way yep but
how<00:06:27.140> far<00:06:27.410> would<00:06:27.530> that<00:06:27.590> really<00:06:27.890> get<00:06:28.130> him<00:06:28.280> in<00:06:28.400> a

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:28.430 
how far would that really get him in a

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:31.060 
how far would that really get him in a
fight<00:06:28.870> because<00:06:29.870> he<00:06:30.020> was<00:06:30.260> very<00:06:30.470> low<00:06:30.710> on<00:06:30.860> key

00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:31.070 
fight because he was very low on key

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:32.890 
fight because he was very low on key
when<00:06:31.250> he<00:06:31.370> had<00:06:31.490> gotten<00:06:31.700> cut<00:06:31.910> in<00:06:32.030> half<00:06:32.210> by<00:06:32.480> his

00:06:32.890 --> 00:06:32.900 
when he had gotten cut in half by his

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:33.360 
when he had gotten cut in half by his
own

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:33.370 
own

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:37.500 
own

00:06:38.909 --> 00:06:38.919 
and something else on the point out is

00:06:38.919 --> 00:06:40.350 
and something else on the point out is
is<00:06:39.130> I<00:06:39.250> feel<00:06:39.430> like<00:06:39.490> if<00:06:39.729> you<00:06:39.850> cut<00:06:40.030> off<00:06:40.150> Freese's

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:40.360 
is I feel like if you cut off Freese's

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:42.480 
is I feel like if you cut off Freese's
head<00:06:40.660> he<00:06:40.810> will<00:06:40.930> still<00:06:41.050> be<00:06:41.169> alive<00:06:41.320> I<00:06:41.560> would

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:42.490 
head he will still be alive I would

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:44.670 
head he will still be alive I would
agree<00:06:42.699> cuz<00:06:43.389> he<00:06:43.510> may<00:06:43.750> even<00:06:43.810> he<00:06:44.110> said<00:06:44.320> he<00:06:44.500> doesn't

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:44.680 
agree cuz he may even he said he doesn't

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:46.230 
agree cuz he may even he said he doesn't
he<00:06:45.070> doesn't<00:06:45.100> really<00:06:45.370> breathe<00:06:45.729> it<00:06:45.970> doesn't<00:06:46.180> i

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:46.240 
he doesn't really breathe it doesn't i

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:48.510 
he doesn't really breathe it doesn't i
can<00:06:46.419> really<00:06:46.570> use<00:06:46.690> his<00:06:46.870> organs<00:06:47.350> like<00:06:47.710> he<00:06:48.370> is

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:48.520 
can really use his organs like he is

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:51.600 
can really use his organs like he is
just<00:06:48.550> like<00:06:49.090> the<00:06:49.270> ultimate<00:06:49.919> warrior<00:06:50.919> alien

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:51.610 
just like the ultimate warrior alien

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:54.330 
just like the ultimate warrior alien
thing<00:06:52.290> like<00:06:53.290> that<00:06:53.320> that's<00:06:53.680> just<00:06:53.889> what<00:06:54.100> Frieza

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:54.340 
thing like that that's just what Frieza

00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:58.439 
thing like that that's just what Frieza
is<00:06:54.580> now<00:06:55.449> King<00:06:55.840> cold<00:06:56.139> was<00:06:56.320> a<00:06:56.350> mutation<00:06:57.070> and<00:06:57.449> it

00:06:58.439 --> 00:06:58.449 
is now King cold was a mutation and it

00:06:58.449 --> 00:07:01.320 
is now King cold was a mutation and it
is<00:06:59.020> unsure<00:06:59.639> unclear<00:07:00.639> of<00:07:00.760> how<00:07:00.880> their<00:07:01.090> body

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:01.330 
is unsure unclear of how their body

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:02.850 
is unsure unclear of how their body
structures<00:07:01.840> really<00:07:02.080> operate<00:07:02.500> him<00:07:02.680> and

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:02.860 
structures really operate him and

00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:04.950 
structures really operate him and
freezin<00:07:03.250> so<00:07:04.120> it's<00:07:04.360> definitely<00:07:04.720> possible

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:04.960 
freezin so it's definitely possible

00:07:04.960 --> 00:07:07.920 
freezin so it's definitely possible
because<00:07:05.650> like<00:07:05.889> I<00:07:06.010> said<00:07:06.070> in<00:07:06.490> anime<00:07:07.479> he<00:07:07.600> did<00:07:07.750> have

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:07.930 
because like I said in anime he did have

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:09.330 
because like I said in anime he did have
that<00:07:08.110> chunk<00:07:08.380> taken<00:07:08.530> out<00:07:08.770> his<00:07:08.919> head<00:07:09.070> one<00:07:09.220> who's

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:09.340 
that chunk taken out his head one who's

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:12.900 
that chunk taken out his head one who's
flown<00:07:09.490> in<00:07:09.669> space<00:07:09.810> yeah<00:07:10.889> yeah<00:07:11.889> he's<00:07:12.400> yeah

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:12.910 
flown in space yeah yeah he's yeah

00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:16.320 
flown in space yeah yeah he's yeah
pretty<00:07:13.539> much<00:07:13.800> so<00:07:14.800> uh<00:07:15.220> that<00:07:15.910> is<00:07:15.940> our<00:07:16.180> evidence

00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:16.330 
pretty much so uh that is our evidence

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:18.090 
pretty much so uh that is our evidence
that<00:07:16.990> is<00:07:17.080> there<00:07:17.169> evidence<00:07:17.320> and<00:07:17.710> now<00:07:17.800> we<00:07:17.860> want

00:07:18.090 --> 00:07:18.100 
that is there evidence and now we want

00:07:18.100 --> 00:07:19.620 
that is there evidence and now we want
to<00:07:18.130> hear<00:07:18.370> from<00:07:18.430> the<00:07:18.820> people<00:07:18.970> to<00:07:19.360> those<00:07:19.479> watch

00:07:19.620 --> 00:07:19.630 
to hear from the people to those watch

00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:21.029 
to hear from the people to those watch
this<00:07:19.810> video<00:07:19.990> what<00:07:20.590> are<00:07:20.650> your<00:07:20.770> thoughts<00:07:20.889> on
