00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:13.500
 there is a website that is called 

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.139
 grade each and is to share drawings 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.300
 facts in this program in principle there are 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.220
 several similar programs then a 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:22.950
 drawing that I had put on a tractor 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.840
 one day I got an email from a boss 

00:00:22.950 --> 00:00:27.330
 started there are I really like this 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.340
 drawing that we would like to use to make you 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.309
 advertising to our machine we build 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:34.519
 3d printers 

00:00:31.309 --> 00:00:36.659
 that they put my name out there 

00:00:34.519 --> 00:00:38.940
 then I'm telling me today they will not want 

00:00:36.659 --> 00:00:41.609
 make us a little job, draw me something 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:43.859
 like this tractor a little bit more 

00:00:41.609 --> 00:00:46.199
 complicated if you and I send you the 

00:00:43.859 --> 00:00:48.329
 machine that you're testing 

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:50.399
 your design and art stay with the machine 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:52.469
 when he received a call from fedex 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:55.199
 Quiet package 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.359
 there he already believes him from there 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:01:00.179
 working on this model is a crane 

00:00:57.359 --> 00:01:03.629
 it is a model no more but if it helps 

00:01:00.179 --> 00:01:05.400
 to teach that detail ability 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.680
 that can be achieved with the machine on 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.120
 procedure to get a piece 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:13.570
 it's first I need to draw 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:16.060
 then with another program calling him 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:18.550
 the instructions of the machine so that 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.950
 I was drawing little by little the pencil and 

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:23.590
 is drawing floor by floor back you have 

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:26.950
 two rolls of material then what 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:30.280
 does this head is pulling this 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:32.320
 this thread of the rolls melts you until 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.780
 a certain point and then injects it into a 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.880
 much thinner thread and with this thread 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:41.250
 is drawing each layer and as they go 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.250
 increasing the layers goes down the table 

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:46.540
 the applications that you can have are 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:49.210
 innumerable the truth here in the 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:51.820
 university could be used to encourage 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:54.130
 that the students learn to draw in 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:57.220
 this solidworks program is the fact of 

00:01:54.130 --> 00:01:59.170
 take out a piece of virtual reality and 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:01.600
 having it physically encourages you 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:04.990
 enough to continue drawing learn more 

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:07.240
 another very useful application is also a 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.760
 course with hydraulic motor machines 

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:12.580
 of combustion is super interesting or 

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:15.670
 it helps teachers to be able to 

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:18.220
 physically teach the mechanisms by 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:20.770
 example this semester in systems 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:23.890
 digital we had to build an arm 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:25.880
 robot and the clamp and he says on the machine 

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:28.310
 here 

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:31.160
 I would like to try to make a 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:34.280
 model to melt some piece in metal 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:36.140
 and be equal to this model I have some 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.330
 remote control cars could be 

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.880
 top and also make pieces for 

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.440
 these cars improve one more way 

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:45.890
 soon he did get someone who wants 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:49.240
 make some prototype and accept you like 

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.240
 enough to work with your hand
