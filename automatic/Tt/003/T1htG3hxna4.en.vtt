00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:07.470 
really really tight is gonna be a little

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.500 
really really tight is gonna be a little
bit<00:01:07.619> worse<00:01:07.770> of<00:01:08.040> a<00:01:08.159> game<00:01:08.340> than<00:01:08.640> one<00:01:09.240> where

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
bit worse of a game than one where

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.149 
bit worse of a game than one where
correct<00:01:09.930> strategy<00:01:10.140> forces<00:01:10.830> you<00:01:10.950> to<00:01:11.040> play

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159

loser<00:01:11.520> and<00:01:11.670> play<00:01:11.850> more<00:01:12.000> hands<00:01:12.320> so<00:01:13.320> people<00:01:13.500> who

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
loser and play more hands so people who

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.140 
loser and play more hands so people who
say<00:01:13.890> that<00:01:14.010> this<00:01:14.130> is<00:01:14.280> like<00:01:14.430> a<00:01:14.460> more<00:01:14.700> skillful

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
say that this is like a more skillful

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.249 
say that this is like a more skillful
format<00:01:15.540> because<00:01:15.630> you<00:01:15.840> can't<00:01:16.049> go<00:01:16.110> all-in

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
format because you can't go all-in

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.289 
format because you can't go all-in
preflop<00:01:16.560> or<00:01:16.979> whatever<00:01:17.310> it's<00:01:17.549> just<00:01:17.790> total

preflop or whatever it's just total

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:20.120 
preflop or whatever it's just total
nonsense<00:01:18.439> just<00:01:19.439> like<00:01:19.560> well<00:01:19.710> you<00:01:19.799> can't<00:01:19.950> go<00:01:20.040> on

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
nonsense just like well you can't go on

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:21.499 
nonsense just like well you can't go on
preflop<00:01:20.490> but<00:01:20.700> you<00:01:20.759> can<00:01:20.880> also<00:01:21.000> just<00:01:21.210> like<00:01:21.390> you

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
preflop but you can also just like you

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:24.499 
preflop but you can also just like you
know<00:01:22.460> fold<00:01:23.460> eight<00:01:23.610> orbits<00:01:23.939> in<00:01:24.060> a<00:01:24.119> row<00:01:24.240> and<00:01:24.420> it's

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
know fold eight orbits in a row and it's

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:26.810 
know fold eight orbits in a row and it's
like<00:01:24.630> fine<00:01:24.810> you<00:01:25.020> know<00:01:25.049> maybe<00:01:25.830> not<00:01:26.009> a<00:01:26.070> 10k

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
like fine you know maybe not a 10k

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.910 
like fine you know maybe not a 10k
championships<00:01:27.420> but<00:01:27.840> maybe<00:01:28.229> like<00:01:28.380> a<00:01:28.439> 5k<00:01:28.890> or

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
championships but maybe like a 5k or

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.940 
championships but maybe like a 5k or
something<00:01:30.049> most<00:01:31.049> of<00:01:31.140> the<00:01:31.229> players<00:01:31.409> don't

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
something most of the players don't

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.140 
something most of the players don't
really<00:01:32.100> like<00:01:32.280> it<00:01:32.430> because<00:01:32.579> it's<00:01:32.820> kind<00:01:32.939> of<00:01:33.030> like

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
really like it because it's kind of like

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.890 
really like it because it's kind of like
a<00:01:33.210> tighter<00:01:33.479> game<00:01:34.909> but<00:01:35.909> I<00:01:35.939> don't<00:01:36.360> mind<00:01:36.540> it<00:01:36.659> it's

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
a tighter game but I don't mind it it's

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.410 
a tighter game but I don't mind it it's
still<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:37.320> same<00:01:37.350> game<00:01:37.799> but<00:01:38.280> maybe<00:01:38.490> not<00:01:38.939> a<00:01:39.000> 10k

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
still the same game but maybe not a 10k

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.469 
still the same game but maybe not a 10k
is<00:01:39.720> necessary<00:01:40.110> maybe<00:01:40.320> five<00:01:40.920> I<00:01:41.280> mean<00:01:42.270> it's<00:01:42.420> a

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
is necessary maybe five I mean it's a

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:44.210 
is necessary maybe five I mean it's a
little<00:01:42.600> strange<00:01:42.960> because<00:01:43.259> there's<00:01:43.860> no<00:01:44.009> pot

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
little strange because there's no pot

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.550 
little strange because there's no pot
limit<00:01:44.399> really<00:01:44.759> anywhere<00:01:45.060> else<00:01:45.270> but<00:01:45.689> it's<00:01:46.350> nice

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
limit really anywhere else but it's nice

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.679 
limit really anywhere else but it's nice
to<00:01:46.710> have<00:01:46.799> a<00:01:46.890> bigger<00:01:47.040> buy-in<00:01:47.549> and<00:01:47.880> I<00:01:48.479> wouldn't

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
to have a bigger buy-in and I wouldn't

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.179 
to have a bigger buy-in and I wouldn't
want<00:01:48.810> to<00:01:48.840> play<00:01:49.020> pot<00:01:49.200> limit<00:01:49.380> every<00:01:49.590> single<00:01:49.979> day

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
want to play pot limit every single day

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.700 
want to play pot limit every single day
but<00:01:50.270> it's<00:01:51.270> it's<00:01:51.600> not<00:01:51.780> too<00:01:51.960> bad<00:01:52.079> to<00:01:52.290> change<00:01:52.560> it

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
but it's it's not too bad to change it

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:54.649 
but it's it's not too bad to change it
up<00:01:52.829> I<00:01:52.950> don't<00:01:53.100> mind<00:01:53.310> it<00:01:53.430> too<00:01:53.579> much<00:01:53.610> but<00:01:54.149> I<00:01:54.390> also

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
up I don't mind it too much but I also

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:56.889 
up I don't mind it too much but I also
wouldn't<00:01:54.960> really<00:01:55.110> mind<00:01:55.320> to<00:01:55.470> get<00:01:55.619> rid<00:01:55.740> of<00:01:55.770> it<00:01:55.979> I

00:01:56.889 --> 00:01:56.899 
wouldn't really mind to get rid of it I

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:58.730 
wouldn't really mind to get rid of it I
think<00:01:57.899> it<00:01:57.960> wouldn't<00:01:58.110> make<00:01:58.200> sense<00:01:58.259> to<00:01:58.530> change

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
think it wouldn't make sense to change

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.649 
think it wouldn't make sense to change
the<00:01:58.920> 10k<00:01:59.219> pot<00:01:59.460> limit<00:01:59.610> to<00:01:59.850> something<00:02:00.180> else<00:02:00.329> like

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:00.659 
the 10k pot limit to something else like

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:02.539 
the 10k pot limit to something else like
it<00:02:00.689> just<00:02:00.990> doesn't<00:02:01.320> get<00:02:01.409> many<00:02:01.560> players<00:02:01.860> and<00:02:02.280> I

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
it just doesn't get many players and I

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.429 
it just doesn't get many players and I
think<00:02:02.820> a<00:02:03.060> 10k<00:02:03.540> No<00:02:03.719> Limit<00:02:03.960> eight<00:02:04.079> handed

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
think a 10k No Limit eight handed

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.459 
think a 10k No Limit eight handed
tournament<00:02:04.740> would<00:02:04.799> be<00:02:04.920> great<00:02:05.159> and<00:02:05.340> said<00:02:06.469> we

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469
