00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
hey guys this is Ivan with overlooking t

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:13.879 
hey guys this is Ivan with overlooking t
and<00:00:12.480> in<00:00:12.570> today's<00:00:12.840> video<00:00:13.049> we're<00:00:13.380> building<00:00:13.740> a

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
and in today's video we're building a

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:17.840 
and in today's video we're building a
decorative<00:00:14.400> staircase<00:00:15.089> door<00:00:15.420> BAM<00:00:16.609> alright<00:00:17.609> so

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:17.850 
decorative staircase door BAM alright so

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.810 
decorative staircase door BAM alright so
this<00:00:18.029> was<00:00:18.300> requested<00:00:18.900> by<00:00:18.930> nobody<00:00:19.640> this<00:00:20.640> was

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820 
this was requested by nobody this was

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.640 
this was requested by nobody this was
actually<00:00:21.000> something<00:00:21.539> I<00:00:21.779> ran<00:00:21.990> into<00:00:22.199> when<00:00:22.470> I<00:00:22.529> was

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
actually something I ran into when I was

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.189 
actually something I ran into when I was
looking<00:00:22.949> for<00:00:23.250> XOR<00:00:23.970> gates<00:00:24.210> for<00:00:24.420> my<00:00:24.510> extra<00:00:24.900> gates

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
looking for XOR gates for my extra gates

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.099 
looking for XOR gates for my extra gates
tutorial<00:00:25.980> video<00:00:26.359> add<00:00:27.359> some<00:00:27.689> kid<00:00:27.900> build

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
tutorial video add some kid build

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.080 
tutorial video add some kid build
something<00:00:28.710> along<00:00:28.949> these<00:00:29.099> lines<00:00:29.160> and<00:00:29.730> I<00:00:29.789> figure

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
something along these lines and I figure

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.630 
something along these lines and I figure
I<00:00:30.150> built<00:00:30.449> it<00:00:30.599> kind<00:00:30.810> of<00:00:30.869> simplify<00:00:31.380> it<00:00:31.640> and

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
I built it kind of simplify it and

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.880 
I built it kind of simplify it and
really<00:00:33.149> the<00:00:33.450> main<00:00:33.630> thing<00:00:33.930> that<00:00:34.230> I<00:00:34.649> like<00:00:34.860> about

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
really the main thing that I like about

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:37.220 
really the main thing that I like about
it<00:00:35.190> it's<00:00:35.489> not<00:00:35.640> secret<00:00:36.059> at<00:00:36.420> all<00:00:36.540> I<00:00:36.600> mean<00:00:36.809> you<00:00:37.079> can

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
it it's not secret at all I mean you can

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.869 
it it's not secret at all I mean you can
see<00:00:37.410> the<00:00:37.530> sticky<00:00:37.860> pistons<00:00:38.280> are<00:00:38.399> right<00:00:38.579> here

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
see the sticky pistons are right here

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.910 
see the sticky pistons are right here
but<00:00:39.570> it<00:00:39.660> was<00:00:39.780> the<00:00:39.870> way<00:00:39.899> that<00:00:40.200> the<00:00:40.350> line<00:00:40.559> shines

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
but it was the way that the line shines

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.619 
but it was the way that the line shines
through<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.550> blocks<00:00:41.910> obviously<00:00:42.420> they're

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
through the blocks obviously they're

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.160 
through the blocks obviously they're
transparent<00:00:43.110> blog<00:00:43.469> so<00:00:43.710> that's<00:00:43.920> what<00:00:44.040> they<00:00:44.160> do

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:45.170 
transparent blog so that's what they do

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.319 
transparent blog so that's what they do
you<00:00:46.170> hop<00:00:46.410> in<00:00:46.680> and<00:00:47.129> you<00:00:47.309> know<00:00:47.430> it's<00:00:47.670> whatever<00:00:48.120> in

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
you hop in and you know it's whatever in

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.110 
you hop in and you know it's whatever in
here<00:00:48.739> this<00:00:49.739> does<00:00:50.010> have<00:00:50.219> an<00:00:50.340> xor<00:00:50.789> gate<00:00:50.820> because

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:51.120 
here this does have an xor gate because

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.000 
here this does have an xor gate because
again<00:00:51.449> it<00:00:51.570> was<00:00:51.660> kind<00:00:51.870> of<00:00:51.930> done<00:00:52.140> the<00:00:52.170> same<00:00:52.770> night

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
again it was kind of done the same night

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.299 
again it was kind of done the same night
i<00:00:53.039> did<00:00:53.489> my<00:00:53.640> xor<00:00:54.120> gate<00:00:54.559> video<00:00:55.559> but<00:00:55.800> i'm<00:00:55.920> just<00:00:56.160> now

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
i did my xor gate video but i'm just now

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.700 
i did my xor gate video but i'm just now
doing<00:00:56.699> the<00:00:56.879> video<00:00:57.120> for<00:00:57.360> this<00:00:57.480> one<00:00:57.719> this<00:00:58.530> is

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
doing the video for this one this is

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.900 
doing the video for this one this is
number<00:00:58.920> 10<00:00:59.430> in<00:00:59.730> the<00:00:59.789> XOR<00:01:01.309> video<00:01:02.309> tutorial

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
number 10 in the XOR video tutorial

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:04.340 
number 10 in the XOR video tutorial
things<00:01:03.149> so<00:01:03.359> if<00:01:03.420> you<00:01:03.539> want<00:01:03.719> to<00:01:03.809> throw<00:01:04.019> an<00:01:04.170> extra

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:04.350 
things so if you want to throw an extra

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.039 
things so if you want to throw an extra
game<00:01:04.710> in<00:01:04.769> there<00:01:05.040> feel<00:01:05.220> free<00:01:05.250> to<00:01:05.489> do<00:01:05.670> so<00:01:05.900> this<00:01:06.900> is

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
game in there feel free to do so this is

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.010 
game in there feel free to do so this is
one<00:01:07.260> input<00:01:07.439> this<00:01:07.830> is<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.220> other<00:01:08.430> input<00:01:09.020> but

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
one input this is the other input but

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.810 
one input this is the other input but
yeah<00:01:10.140> it's<00:01:10.590> really<00:01:10.830> just<00:01:10.950> about<00:01:11.100> how<00:01:11.430> awesome

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:11.820 
yeah it's really just about how awesome

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.200 
yeah it's really just about how awesome
and<00:01:12.450> pretty<00:01:12.840> it<00:01:12.990> looks<00:01:13.140> at<00:01:13.650> night<00:01:14.030> so<00:01:15.030> yeah

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.320 
and pretty it looks at night so yeah
let's<00:01:15.750> build<00:01:15.990> this<00:01:16.110> um<00:01:16.380> this<00:01:16.830> one<00:01:17.820> is<00:01:18.000> you<00:01:18.240> know

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
let's build this um this one is you know

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.240 
let's build this um this one is you know
only<00:01:18.509> for<00:01:18.869> high<00:01:19.080> I<00:01:19.110> mean<00:01:19.439> you<00:01:19.500> can<00:01:19.650> go<00:01:19.680> higher

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
only for high I mean you can go higher

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.340 
only for high I mean you can go higher
if<00:01:20.460> you<00:01:20.580> like<00:01:20.759> it's<00:01:21.330> already<00:01:21.479> set<00:01:21.750> the<00:01:21.930> sticky

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
if you like it's already set the sticky

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.350 
if you like it's already set the sticky
pistons<00:01:22.740> and<00:01:22.830> these<00:01:23.130> turkeys<00:01:23.580> attached<00:01:24.000> to

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
pistons and these turkeys attached to

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.840 
pistons and these turkeys attached to
them<00:01:24.570> now<00:01:25.530> behind<00:01:25.920> the<00:01:26.040> very<00:01:26.280> first<00:01:26.549> sticky

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
them now behind the very first sticky

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.960 
them now behind the very first sticky
piston<00:01:27.240> place<00:01:27.960> a<00:01:28.200> redstone<00:01:28.950> torch<00:01:29.250> down<00:01:29.729> on

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
piston place a redstone torch down on

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:33.789 
piston place a redstone torch down on
both<00:01:30.659> of<00:01:30.720> them<00:01:30.960> and<00:01:31.189> then<00:01:32.189> just<00:01:32.340> blocks

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:33.799 
both of them and then just blocks

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:37.130 
both of them and then just blocks
directly<00:01:34.799> above<00:01:35.040> that<00:01:35.310> here<00:01:36.240> here<00:01:36.900> and<00:01:37.049> here

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140 
directly above that here here and here

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.520 
directly above that here here and here
and<00:01:37.680> then<00:01:38.460> redstone<00:01:38.939> dust<00:01:39.119> running<00:01:39.659> downwards

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
and then redstone dust running downwards

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.969 
and then redstone dust running downwards
like<00:01:40.619> so<00:01:41.659> same<00:01:42.659> thing<00:01:42.840> on<00:01:42.960> this<00:01:43.140> one<00:01:43.350> directly

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
like so same thing on this one directly

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.060 
like so same thing on this one directly
above<00:01:44.189> this<00:01:44.610> one<00:01:45.110> like<00:01:46.110> that<00:01:46.380> like<00:01:46.799> that<00:01:46.829> like

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
above this one like that like that like

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:53.270 
above this one like that like that like
that<00:01:47.340> and<00:01:48.079> redstone<00:01:49.079> dust<00:01:50.930> like<00:01:51.930> so<00:01:52.350> alright

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
that and redstone dust like so alright

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:55.609 
that and redstone dust like so alright
um<00:01:53.490> I<00:01:53.790> mean<00:01:54.030> I<00:01:54.149> have<00:01:54.329> like<00:01:54.479> 100<00:01:54.930> other<00:01:55.110> videos

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
um I mean I have like 100 other videos

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:57.380 
um I mean I have like 100 other videos
involving<00:01:55.829> redstone<00:01:56.610> so<00:01:56.850> if<00:01:57.000> you're<00:01:57.149> watching

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
involving redstone so if you're watching

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.399 
involving redstone so if you're watching
mine<00:01:57.869> and<00:01:58.229> by<00:01:58.500> now<00:01:58.740> you<00:01:59.579> should<00:01:59.790> already<00:01:59.939> know

00:02:00.399 --> 00:02:00.409 
mine and by now you should already know

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:04.789 
mine and by now you should already know
rats<00:02:01.409> don't<00:02:01.710> you<00:02:02.399> know<00:02:02.520> runs<00:02:03.060> downwards<00:02:03.689> so<00:02:04.619> in

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
rats don't you know runs downwards so in

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:08.540 
rats don't you know runs downwards so in
this<00:02:04.920> case<00:02:05.250> we'll<00:02:05.610> use<00:02:05.640> a<00:02:06.630> lever<00:02:07.560> and<00:02:07.920> a<00:02:08.250> button

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:08.550 
this case we'll use a lever and a button

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.360 
this case we'll use a lever and a button
why<00:02:08.879> not<00:02:09.090> so<00:02:10.080> let's<00:02:10.410> say<00:02:10.619> and<00:02:10.920> actually<00:02:11.280> you

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370 
why not so let's say and actually you

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.840 
why not so let's say and actually you
know<00:02:11.459> what<00:02:11.640> the<00:02:11.819> main<00:02:12.000> part<00:02:12.239> of<00:02:12.300> this

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:12.850 
know what the main part of this

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:15.090 
know what the main part of this
let's<00:02:13.000> cover<00:02:13.180> this<00:02:13.390> up<00:02:13.540> for<00:02:13.750> now<00:02:13.870> though<00:02:14.100> is

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.100 
let's cover this up for now though is

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.220 
let's cover this up for now though is
the<00:02:15.520> fact<00:02:15.550> that<00:02:15.850> it's<00:02:16.060> decorative<00:02:16.510> has

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:17.230 
the fact that it's decorative has

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:20.100 
the fact that it's decorative has
nothing<00:02:17.560> to<00:02:17.650> do<00:02:17.770> with<00:02:17.920> secrecy<00:02:18.570> so<00:02:19.570> this<00:02:19.780> isn't

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
nothing to do with secrecy so this isn't

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.920 
nothing to do with secrecy so this isn't
for<00:02:20.290> you<00:02:20.500> uh<00:02:20.970> weird<00:02:21.970> as<00:02:22.210> out<00:02:22.480> there<00:02:22.690> they<00:02:22.810> have

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:22.930 
for you uh weird as out there they have

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.410 
for you uh weird as out there they have
something<00:02:23.170> to<00:02:23.260> hide<00:02:23.640> this<00:02:24.640> is<00:02:24.790> just<00:02:25.030> really

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:25.420 
something to hide this is just really

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.030 
something to hide this is just really
just<00:02:25.690> you<00:02:25.990> know<00:02:26.110> for<00:02:26.350> something<00:02:26.680> that<00:02:26.830> looks

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
just you know for something that looks

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.940 
just you know for something that looks
kind<00:02:27.220> of<00:02:27.340> cool<00:02:27.780> for<00:02:28.780> your<00:02:28.930> own<00:02:28.960> world<00:02:29.320> nothing

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:29.950 
kind of cool for your own world nothing

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:33.110 
kind of cool for your own world nothing
really<00:02:30.190> to<00:02:30.370> hide<00:02:30.550> its<00:02:30.850> not<00:02:31.120> again<00:02:31.480> a<00:02:31.720> very

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
really to hide its not again a very

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.410 
really to hide its not again a very
secretive<00:02:34.120> type<00:02:34.390> of<00:02:34.570> thing<00:02:35.340> it's<00:02:36.340> just<00:02:37.240> the

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:37.420 
secretive type of thing it's just the

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.730 
secretive type of thing it's just the
door<00:02:37.660> on<00:02:38.470> just<00:02:39.190> an<00:02:39.340> entryway<00:02:39.730> place<00:02:40.740> alright

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:41.740 
door on just an entryway place alright

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:45.360 
door on just an entryway place alright
awesome<00:02:41.920> so<00:02:42.430> you<00:02:43.090> know<00:02:43.210> behind<00:02:43.570> this<00:02:44.370> let's

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
awesome so you know behind this let's

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:48.240 
awesome so you know behind this let's
throw<00:02:45.580> a<00:02:45.610> button<00:02:45.940> here<00:02:46.350> signal<00:02:47.350> goes<00:02:47.500> down<00:02:47.770> you

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
throw a button here signal goes down you

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.000 
throw a button here signal goes down you
go<00:02:48.400> in<00:02:48.580> and<00:02:49.330> we're<00:02:49.810> good<00:02:49.960> to<00:02:50.080> go<00:02:50.110> alright

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.010 
go in and we're good to go alright

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:53.610 
go in and we're good to go alright
perfect<00:02:51.250> on<00:02:51.700> redstone<00:02:52.440> actually<00:02:53.440> I<00:02:53.470> mean

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:53.620 
perfect on redstone actually I mean

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.400 
perfect on redstone actually I mean
glowstone<00:02:54.120> and<00:02:55.120> that's<00:02:55.660> what<00:02:55.810> adds<00:02:55.990> to<00:02:56.080> shine

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
glowstone and that's what adds to shine

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.980 
glowstone and that's what adds to shine
to<00:02:56.650> it<00:02:56.680> you<00:02:57.310> know<00:02:57.430> what<00:02:57.580> all<00:02:58.300> transparent

00:02:58.980 --> 00:02:58.990 
to it you know what all transparent

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:01.650 
to it you know what all transparent
blocks<00:02:59.380> line<00:02:59.770> shines<00:03:00.250> through<00:03:00.670> them<00:03:00.850> so

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:01.660 
blocks line shines through them so

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.930 
blocks line shines through them so
that's<00:03:01.870> what<00:03:02.110> the<00:03:02.230> stairs<00:03:02.530> constitute<00:03:03.430> as<00:03:03.610> so

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:03.940 
that's what the stairs constitute as so

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.570 
that's what the stairs constitute as so
yeah<00:03:04.210> that's<00:03:05.140> it<00:03:05.440> see<00:03:05.740> that<00:03:05.920> it's<00:03:06.190> all<00:03:06.310> shiny

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:06.580 
yeah that's it see that it's all shiny

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:11.700 
yeah that's it see that it's all shiny
cute<00:03:07.390> not<00:03:08.320> cute<00:03:08.350> but<00:03:09.150> pretty<00:03:10.150> sure<00:03:10.900> whatever

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:11.710 
cute not cute but pretty sure whatever

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:14.010 
cute not cute but pretty sure whatever
forget<00:03:12.430> I<00:03:12.460> said<00:03:12.550> cute<00:03:13.030> so<00:03:13.720> you<00:03:13.810> hit<00:03:13.930> your

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:14.020 
forget I said cute so you hit your

00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:17.340 
forget I said cute so you hit your
button<00:03:14.370> and<00:03:15.370> you're<00:03:15.520> inside<00:03:15.970> if<00:03:16.390> you<00:03:16.960> want<00:03:17.110> to

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:17.350 
button and you're inside if you want to

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:19.710 
button and you're inside if you want to
run<00:03:17.470> your<00:03:17.500> wiring<00:03:17.950> from<00:03:18.430> this<00:03:19.030> portion<00:03:19.480> with<00:03:19.690> a

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:19.720 
run your wiring from this portion with a

00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.300 
run your wiring from this portion with a
button<00:03:20.080> and<00:03:20.200> you<00:03:20.290> don't<00:03:20.500> want<00:03:20.620> to<00:03:20.650> do<00:03:20.800> an<00:03:20.890> xor

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:21.310 
button and you don't want to do an xor

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:23.790 
button and you don't want to do an xor
gate<00:03:21.420> which<00:03:22.420> I<00:03:22.630> am<00:03:22.720> going<00:03:22.750> to<00:03:22.960> put<00:03:23.200> on<00:03:23.410> the

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:23.800 
gate which I am going to put on the

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:26.910 
gate which I am going to put on the
annotation<00:03:24.100> on<00:03:24.670> the<00:03:24.900> XOR<00:03:25.900> gate<00:03:26.140> tutorial

annotation on the XOR gate tutorial

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.760 
annotation on the XOR gate tutorial
video<00:03:27.690> and<00:03:28.690> but<00:03:28.990> you<00:03:29.080> know<00:03:29.200> let's<00:03:29.410> say<00:03:29.530> you<00:03:29.620> go

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:29.770 
video and but you know let's say you go

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:31.470 
video and but you know let's say you go
with<00:03:29.920> a<00:03:29.980> button<00:03:30.250> I<00:03:30.460> probably<00:03:30.970> would<00:03:31.210> be<00:03:31.330> good

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:31.480 
with a button I probably would be good

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:33.890 
with a button I probably would be good
with<00:03:31.630> a<00:03:31.660> button<00:03:31.900> I<00:03:32.200> don't<00:03:33.100> necessarily<00:03:33.520> like

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
with a button I don't necessarily like

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.990 
with a button I don't necessarily like
overcomplicating<00:03:34.900> things<00:03:34.930> if<00:03:35.440> they<00:03:35.710> work<00:03:36.000> so

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:37.000 
overcomplicating things if they work so

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.630 
overcomplicating things if they work so
there<00:03:37.450> we<00:03:37.540> go<00:03:38.100> button<00:03:39.100> and<00:03:39.910> I'm<00:03:40.030> out<00:03:40.210> oh<00:03:41.640> you

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:42.640 
there we go button and I'm out oh you

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:44.010 
there we go button and I'm out oh you
know<00:03:42.760> even<00:03:42.910> if<00:03:43.120> it<00:03:43.240> catches<00:03:43.450> you<00:03:43.780> it<00:03:43.900> won't

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:44.020 
know even if it catches you it won't

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:46.440 
know even if it catches you it won't
kill<00:03:44.290> you<00:03:44.350> it's<00:03:44.620> a<00:03:44.740> transparent<00:03:45.340> block<00:03:45.520> won't

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450 
kill you it's a transparent block won't

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:49.760 
kill you it's a transparent block won't
even<00:03:46.600> hurt<00:03:46.780> shoot<00:03:47.050> so<00:03:47.980> you're<00:03:48.130> in<00:03:48.450> you're<00:03:49.450> out

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:49.770 
even hurt shoot so you're in you're out

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:51.990 
even hurt shoot so you're in you're out
but<00:03:50.770> yeah<00:03:50.890> if<00:03:51.010> you<00:03:51.130> want<00:03:51.310> to<00:03:51.370> throw<00:03:51.520> an<00:03:51.640> XOR

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:52.000
