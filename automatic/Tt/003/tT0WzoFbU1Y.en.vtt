00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
wish number 5 from the second that I

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.679 
wish number 5 from the second that I
started<00:01:41.700> playing<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:42.000> game<00:01:42.119> I<00:01:42.240> noticed<00:01:42.540> one

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
started playing the game I noticed one

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.620 
started playing the game I noticed one
thing<00:01:42.720> the<00:01:43.470> weird<00:01:43.680> camera<00:01:44.340> angles<00:01:44.790> it<00:01:44.970> starts

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
thing the weird camera angles it starts

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.840 
thing the weird camera angles it starts
with<00:01:45.780> the<00:01:45.899> fact<00:01:46.110> that<00:01:46.229> Nico<00:01:46.710> walks<00:01:47.009> ungodly

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
with the fact that Nico walks ungodly

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.200 
with the fact that Nico walks ungodly
slow<00:01:48.030> and<00:01:48.560> running<00:01:49.560> is<00:01:49.710> not<00:01:49.740> much<00:01:50.100> faster<00:01:50.549> the

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
slow and running is not much faster the

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.999 
slow and running is not much faster the
camera<00:01:51.570> will<00:01:51.720> not<00:01:51.869> stay<00:01:52.079> directly<00:01:52.470> behind<00:01:52.619> him

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
camera will not stay directly behind him

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.280 
camera will not stay directly behind him
so<00:01:53.460> it<00:01:54.000> takes<00:01:54.240> a<00:01:54.360> lot<00:01:54.479> of<00:01:54.509> readjusting<00:01:55.020> to<00:01:55.079> get

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:55.290 
so it takes a lot of readjusting to get

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.020 
so it takes a lot of readjusting to get
it<00:01:55.380> correct<00:01:55.619> did<00:01:56.280> I<00:01:56.369> say<00:01:56.520> that<00:01:56.549> name<00:01:56.820> right
