to cook this to a medium rare but we're
going<00:04:09.140> to<00:04:09.200> pull<00:04:09.470> it<00:04:09.500> off<00:04:10.090> when<00:04:11.090> we<00:04:11.239> get<00:04:11.510> in<00:04:11.720> the

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:12.410 
going to pull it off when we get in the

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:16.120 
going to pull it off when we get in the
neighborhood<00:04:12.890> of<00:04:13.000> 120<00:04:14.000> degrees<00:04:14.500> so<00:04:15.500> we<00:04:15.980> are

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:16.130 
neighborhood of 120 degrees so we are

00:04:16.130 --> 00:04:20.229 
neighborhood of 120 degrees so we are
going<00:04:16.519> to<00:04:17.200> close<00:04:18.200> the<00:04:18.440> lid<00:04:18.590> back<00:04:19.090> let<00:04:20.090> the

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:20.239 
going to close the lid back let the

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:22.420 
going to close the lid back let the
temperature<00:04:20.450> come<00:04:20.989> back<00:04:21.200> and<00:04:21.470> stabilize<00:04:22.100> at

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:22.430 
temperature come back and stabilize at

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:25.029 
temperature come back and stabilize at
500<00:04:23.180> degrees<00:04:23.570> which<00:04:24.350> will<00:04:24.530> only<00:04:24.710> take<00:04:25.010> a

00:04:25.029 --> 00:04:25.039 
500 degrees which will only take a

00:04:25.039 --> 00:04:27.790 
500 degrees which will only take a
couple<00:04:25.370> of<00:04:25.550> minutes<00:04:26.000> and<00:04:26.210> then<00:04:26.320> I'll<00:04:27.320> be<00:04:27.590> back

00:04:27.790 --> 00:04:27.800 
couple of minutes and then I'll be back

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.080 
couple of minutes and then I'll be back
here<00:04:28.070> to<00:04:28.160> show<00:04:28.340> you<00:04:28.400> what<00:04:28.610> we're<00:04:28.760> going<00:04:28.850> to<00:04:28.910> do

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.090 
here to show you what we're going to do

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:31.420 
here to show you what we're going to do
next<00:04:29.300> with<00:04:29.630> the<00:04:29.720> temperature<00:04:30.260> after<00:04:30.979> just

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:31.430 
next with the temperature after just

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:33.610 
next with the temperature after just
about<00:04:31.640> seven<00:04:32.000> minutes<00:04:32.479> or<00:04:32.630> so<00:04:32.840> with<00:04:33.200> that<00:04:33.380> meat

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:33.620 
about seven minutes or so with that meat

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:36.040 
about seven minutes or so with that meat
on<00:04:33.830> there<00:04:34.070> our<00:04:34.100> grills<00:04:34.550> come<00:04:34.850> back<00:04:35.030> up<00:04:35.240> to<00:04:35.390> 500

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.050 
on there our grills come back up to 500

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:38.830 
on there our grills come back up to 500
degrees<00:04:36.410> so<00:04:37.370> what<00:04:37.580> we're<00:04:37.729> going<00:04:37.880> to<00:04:37.940> do<00:04:38.120> now<00:04:38.450> is

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:38.840 
degrees so what we're going to do now is

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:41.300 
degrees so what we're going to do now is
we're<00:04:39.320> going<00:04:39.410> to<00:04:39.500> close<00:04:39.800> the<00:04:40.130> bottom<00:04:40.520> vent

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:41.310 
we're going to close the bottom vent

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:44.880 
we're going to close the bottom vent
all<00:04:42.310> the<00:04:42.610> way<00:04:42.790> and<00:04:43.150> I'm<00:04:43.900> going<00:04:44.230> to<00:04:44.260> open<00:04:44.380> the

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:44.890 
all the way and I'm going to open the

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:48.120 
all the way and I'm going to open the
top<00:04:45.100> vent<00:04:45.840> about<00:04:46.840> halfway<00:04:47.410> on<00:04:47.650> the<00:04:47.800> slider

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:48.130 
top vent about halfway on the slider

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:49.890 
top vent about halfway on the slider
what<00:04:48.550> we're<00:04:48.700> going<00:04:48.850> to<00:04:48.880> do<00:04:49.090> here<00:04:49.420> is<00:04:49.540> let<00:04:49.750> the

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:49.900 
what we're going to do here is let the

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:53.940 
what we're going to do here is let the
grill<00:04:50.170> cool<00:04:50.560> down<00:04:50.890> to<00:04:51.730> between<00:04:51.970> 300<00:04:52.810> and<00:04:52.950> 325

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:53.950 
grill cool down to between 300 and 325

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:56.250 
grill cool down to between 300 and 325
degrees<00:04:54.640> and<00:04:54.670> once<00:04:55.120> our<00:04:55.300> grill<00:04:55.570> cools<00:04:55.930> down<00:04:56.080> to

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:56.260 
degrees and once our grill cools down to

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.260 
degrees and once our grill cools down to
that<00:04:56.530> level<00:04:56.740> we're<00:04:57.520> going<00:04:57.670> to<00:04:57.730> adjust<00:04:58.060> the

00:04:58.260 --> 00:04:58.270 
that level we're going to adjust the

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:00.330 
that level we're going to adjust the
vents<00:04:58.540> and<00:04:58.870> hold<00:04:59.470> it<00:04:59.620> at<00:04:59.710> that<00:04:59.890> temperature

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:00.340 
vents and hold it at that temperature

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:02.730 
vents and hold it at that temperature
for<00:05:00.730> the<00:05:00.820> rest<00:05:01.030> of<00:05:01.150> the<00:05:01.270> cook<00:05:01.480> so<00:05:02.200> when<00:05:02.440> we<00:05:02.560> get

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:02.740 
for the rest of the cook so when we get

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:05.130 
for the rest of the cook so when we get
back<00:05:02.920> down<00:05:02.980> to<00:05:03.220> 325<00:05:04.180> range<00:05:04.600> I'll<00:05:04.810> come<00:05:05.020> back

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:05.140 
back down to 325 range I'll come back

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:06.420 
back down to 325 range I'll come back
out<00:05:05.380> and<00:05:05.530> show<00:05:05.680> you<00:05:05.740> what<00:05:05.950> we're<00:05:06.070> going<00:05:06.190> to<00:05:06.220> do

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:06.430 
out and show you what we're going to do

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:09.960 
out and show you what we're going to do
with<00:05:06.580> the<00:05:06.700> vents<00:05:07.090> we<00:05:07.930> are<00:05:08.080> 45<00:05:08.710> minutes<00:05:09.250> in<00:05:09.430> and

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:09.970 
with the vents we are 45 minutes in and

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:11.910 
with the vents we are 45 minutes in and
my<00:05:10.210> grill<00:05:10.450> temperatures<00:05:11.020> come<00:05:11.290> back<00:05:11.500> down<00:05:11.740> to

00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:11.920 
my grill temperatures come back down to

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:16.050 
my grill temperatures come back down to
about<00:05:12.190> 3:30<00:05:13.410> so<00:05:14.410> I<00:05:14.440> am<00:05:14.980> going<00:05:15.310> to<00:05:15.430> crack<00:05:15.730> the

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:16.060 
about 3:30 so I am going to crack the

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:18.470 
about 3:30 so I am going to crack the
bottom<00:05:16.450> vent<00:05:16.780> back<00:05:17.170> open<00:05:17.650> just<00:05:17.830> a<00:05:17.980> little<00:05:18.010> bit

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:18.480 
bottom vent back open just a little bit

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:20.400 
bottom vent back open just a little bit
actually<00:05:19.480> we're<00:05:19.660> just<00:05:19.810> going<00:05:19.960> to<00:05:19.990> open<00:05:20.080> it

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:20.410 
actually we're just going to open it

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:23.820 
actually we're just going to open it
probably<00:05:21.040> half<00:05:21.880> way<00:05:21.910> and<00:05:22.600> back<00:05:23.320> on<00:05:23.530> the<00:05:23.650> top

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:23.830 
probably half way and back on the top

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:25.710 
probably half way and back on the top
then<00:05:24.100> I'm<00:05:24.310> going<00:05:24.460> to<00:05:24.520> slide<00:05:24.820> the<00:05:25.090> slider<00:05:25.420> all

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:25.720 
then I'm going to slide the slider all

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:29.940 
then I'm going to slide the slider all
the<00:05:25.750> way<00:05:25.900> closed<00:05:26.350> and<00:05:27.450> put<00:05:28.450> my<00:05:28.660> Daisy<00:05:29.380> wheel<00:05:29.770> at

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:29.950 
the way closed and put my Daisy wheel at

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:31.890 
the way closed and put my Daisy wheel at
about<00:05:30.160> 1/2<00:05:30.430> and<00:05:30.880> we're<00:05:31.390> just<00:05:31.480> going<00:05:31.630> to<00:05:31.690> watch

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:31.900 
about 1/2 and we're just going to watch

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:33.540 
about 1/2 and we're just going to watch
the<00:05:32.200> temperature<00:05:32.680> there<00:05:32.920> we<00:05:33.160> want<00:05:33.370> it<00:05:33.430> to

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:33.550 
the temperature there we want it to

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:36.960 
the temperature there we want it to
stabilize<00:05:33.760> out<00:05:34.360> here<00:05:34.600> at<00:05:34.690> about<00:05:34.750> 325<00:05:35.500> so<00:05:36.190> if<00:05:36.790> I

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:36.970 
stabilize out here at about 325 so if I

00:05:36.970 --> 00:05:39.510 
stabilize out here at about 325 so if I
need<00:05:37.210> to<00:05:37.450> bring<00:05:38.260> it<00:05:38.380> up<00:05:38.560> I'm<00:05:38.800> going<00:05:39.250> to<00:05:39.340> open

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:39.520 
need to bring it up I'm going to open

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:42.210 
need to bring it up I'm going to open
this<00:05:39.910> or<00:05:40.240> if<00:05:40.300> I<00:05:40.390> need<00:05:40.540> to<00:05:40.630> close<00:05:40.840> it<00:05:40.900> down<00:05:41.290> I'm

00:05:42.210 --> 00:05:42.220 
this or if I need to close it down I'm

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:43.860 
this or if I need to close it down I'm
going<00:05:42.520> to<00:05:42.580> close<00:05:42.820> that<00:05:42.850> vent<00:05:43.270> so<00:05:43.600> we'll<00:05:43.690> just

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:43.870 
going to close that vent so we'll just

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:45.240 
going to close that vent so we'll just
watch<00:05:44.080> it<00:05:44.260> from<00:05:44.470> here<00:05:44.680> for<00:05:44.860> a<00:05:44.890> little<00:05:45.100> while

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:45.250 
watch it from here for a little while

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:48.180 
watch it from here for a little while
and<00:05:45.430> stabilize<00:05:45.910> out<00:05:46.120> at<00:05:46.210> 325<00:05:46.990> for<00:05:47.380> the<00:05:47.890> rest<00:05:48.070> of

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:48.190 
and stabilize out at 325 for the rest of

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:50.820 
and stabilize out at 325 for the rest of
this<00:05:48.280> cook<00:05:48.840> we've<00:05:49.840> been<00:05:50.050> cooking<00:05:50.200> now<00:05:50.560> for

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:50.830 
this cook we've been cooking now for

00:05:50.830 --> 00:05:54.210 
this cook we've been cooking now for
about<00:05:50.950> 2<00:05:51.520> hours<00:05:51.550> and<00:05:52.150> 40<00:05:52.840> minutes<00:05:52.870> and<00:05:53.590> I've

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:54.220 
about 2 hours and 40 minutes and I've

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:55.830 
about 2 hours and 40 minutes and I've
just<00:05:54.430> checked<00:05:54.730> the<00:05:54.850> temperature<00:05:55.330> on<00:05:55.480> here<00:05:55.720> and

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:55.840 
just checked the temperature on here and

00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:59.550 
just checked the temperature on here and
we're<00:05:55.990> pretty<00:05:56.260> good<00:05:56.850> 120<00:05:57.850> to<00:05:58.270> 125<00:05:58.870> on<00:05:59.440> the
