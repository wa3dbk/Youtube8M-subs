 even the child will understand and now let's 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:44.760
 look at the editor and of course not 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:47.370
 photoshop but it's enough to create 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.590
 mini shidal can be called on two layers 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.959

00:02:53.579 --> 00:02:58.350
 tools it enters the outline on 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.239
 apron colored stamps of various widths and 

00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:02.160
 a palette with selected flowers which 

00:03:00.239 --> 00:03:04.560
 need for a specific pokemon 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.640

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:09.060
 set of tools 

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:10.650

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.720
 view by real brushes 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:16.200
 a tool that blurs the target and 

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:18.450
 also you see four kinds of transparency 

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.800
 for each color that is for each 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:23.910

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:25.560
 and 4 gradations of intensity like this 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:28.250
