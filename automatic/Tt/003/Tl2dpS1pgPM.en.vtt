00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:07.420 
tip may be slightly too wide we've

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:08.940

in<00:01:09.700> case<00:01:10.450> the<00:01:11.110> door<00:01:11.320> frame<00:01:11.620> you've<00:01:11.830> made<00:01:12.270> or

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:13.270 
in case the door frame you've made or

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:14.910 
in case the door frame you've made or
the<00:01:13.510> cladding<00:01:13.840> of<00:01:13.930> firaon<00:01:14.290> is<00:01:14.320> not<00:01:14.680> quite

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:14.920 
the cladding of firaon is not quite

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:18.000 
the cladding of firaon is not quite
right<00:01:15.160> it's<00:01:15.910> so<00:01:16.440> measure<00:01:17.440> the<00:01:17.650> width<00:01:17.800> of<00:01:17.950> your

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:18.010 
right it's so measure the width of your

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:20.760 
right it's so measure the width of your
door<00:01:18.250> frame<00:01:18.550> and<00:01:18.910> allow<00:01:19.570> five<00:01:19.930> mil<00:01:20.260> either

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:20.770 
door frame and allow five mil either

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.510 
door frame and allow five mil either
side<00:01:21.220> and<00:01:22.500> often<00:01:23.500> you'll<00:01:23.620> need<00:01:23.830> to<00:01:23.980> trim<00:01:24.280> these

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:24.520 
side and often you'll need to trim these

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:29.480 
side and often you'll need to trim these
down<00:01:26.490> to<00:01:27.490> get<00:01:27.760> the<00:01:27.880> measurement<00:01:28.300> you<00:01:28.390> need<00:01:28.630> so

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
down to get the measurement you need so

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.180 
down to get the measurement you need so
just<00:01:31.050> measure<00:01:32.050> the<00:01:32.260> width<00:01:32.440> of<00:01:32.620> the<00:01:32.770> door<00:01:32.920> frame

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:33.190 
just measure the width of the door frame

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:36.840 
just measure the width of the door frame
you<00:01:33.340> have<00:01:33.520> on<00:01:33.640> your<00:01:33.820> cubby<00:01:35.400> and<00:01:36.400> I'll<00:01:36.520> have<00:01:36.670> the

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:36.850 
you have on your cubby and I'll have the

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.140 
you have on your cubby and I'll have the
clearance<00:01:37.330> either<00:01:37.480> side<00:01:37.810> for<00:01:37.990> the<00:01:38.110> door<00:01:39.030> so<00:01:40.030> we

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:40.150 
clearance either side for the door so we

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:44.820 
clearance either side for the door so we
just<00:01:40.330> lay<00:01:40.510> that<00:01:40.540> frame<00:01:41.080> out<00:01:41.290> there<00:01:43.560> just<00:01:44.560> use

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:44.830 
just lay that frame out there just use

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:46.680 
just lay that frame out there just use
the<00:01:45.010> door<00:01:45.220> cladding<00:01:45.760> once<00:01:45.970> you've<00:01:46.180> trimmed<00:01:46.480> it

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:46.690 
the door cladding once you've trimmed it

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:49.230 
the door cladding once you've trimmed it
top<00:01:47.560> and<00:01:47.590> bottom<00:01:48.070> give<00:01:48.280> that<00:01:48.400> frame<00:01:48.730> nice<00:01:49.000> and

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:49.240 
top and bottom give that frame nice and

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:58.820 
top and bottom give that frame nice and
straight

00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:58.830 

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:07.920 

okay<00:02:02.190> then<00:02:03.190> run<00:02:03.370> some<00:02:03.550> blood<00:02:06.450> down<00:02:07.450> the<00:02:07.660> frame

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:07.930 
okay then run some blood down the frame

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:10.320 
okay then run some blood down the frame
these<00:02:08.110> timbers<00:02:08.500> are<00:02:08.530> nice<00:02:08.800> and<00:02:09.039> why<00:02:09.330> this

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:10.330 
these timbers are nice and why this

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:15.480 
these timbers are nice and why this
stops<00:02:10.690> the<00:02:11.350> door<00:02:12.540> dropping<00:02:14.130> we'll<00:02:15.130> put<00:02:15.310> some

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.490 
stops the door dropping we'll put some

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:19.490 
stops the door dropping we'll put some
screws<00:02:15.850> in<00:02:15.880> there<00:02:16.380> but<00:02:17.380> once<00:02:17.860> the<00:02:18.010> blue<00:02:18.220> sets

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
screws in there but once the blue sets

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.970 
screws in there but once the blue sets
on<00:02:20.500> the<00:02:20.680> training<00:02:22.320> it<00:02:23.320> will<00:02:23.470> stop<00:02:23.680> the<00:02:23.800> door

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
on the training it will stop the door

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:31.080 
on the training it will stop the door
dropping<00:02:27.720> okay<00:02:28.720> that<00:02:29.290> top<00:02:29.590> one<00:02:29.830> there<00:02:30.090> you

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:31.090 
dropping okay that top one there you

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:32.810 
dropping okay that top one there you
just<00:02:31.270> fix<00:02:31.510> that<00:02:31.630> there<00:02:31.989> so<00:02:32.260> it<00:02:32.320> doesn't<00:02:32.650> move

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
just fix that there so it doesn't move

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:38.310 
just fix that there so it doesn't move
once<00:02:33.820> you've<00:02:33.970> got<00:02:36.930> once<00:02:37.930> you've<00:02:38.050> got<00:02:38.200> the

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:38.320 
once you've got once you've got the

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:41.700 
once you've got once you've got the
correct<00:02:38.590> width<00:02:38.890> of<00:02:39.100> the<00:02:39.220> door<00:02:39.370> frame
