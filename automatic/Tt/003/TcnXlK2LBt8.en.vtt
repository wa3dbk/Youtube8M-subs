amazing another feature that I want to
point<00:04:25.380> out<00:04:25.560> that<00:04:25.770> I<00:04:25.860> think<00:04:25.920> is<00:04:26.130> really

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340 
point out that I think is really

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:28.310 
point out that I think is really
important<00:04:26.940> is<00:04:27.060> that<00:04:27.120> it<00:04:27.420> does<00:04:27.570> have<00:04:27.750> a<00:04:27.810> 24

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:28.320 
important is that it does have a 24

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:30.020 
important is that it does have a 24
millimeter<00:04:28.800> wide<00:04:28.890> angle<00:04:29.490> lens<00:04:29.730> and<00:04:30.000> that

millimeter wide angle lens and that

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:31.580 
millimeter wide angle lens and that
means<00:04:30.360> the<00:04:30.480> camera<00:04:30.810> is<00:04:30.870> going<00:04:30.990> to<00:04:31.080> get<00:04:31.230> more<00:04:31.470> of

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590
