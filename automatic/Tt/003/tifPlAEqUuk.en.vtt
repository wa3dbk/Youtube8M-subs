00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:37.509 
we went all the way the same thing
happened<00:03:35.480> with<00:03:36.319> last<00:03:36.620> year<00:03:36.920> we<00:03:37.069> started<00:03:37.280> to

00:03:37.509 --> 00:03:37.519 
happened with last year we started to

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:39.490 
happened with last year we started to
build<00:03:37.549> again<00:03:38.030> we<00:03:38.540> had<00:03:38.660> a<00:03:38.690> good<00:03:38.900> core<00:03:39.170> that<00:03:39.290> came

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.500 
build again we had a good core that came

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:41.650 
build again we had a good core that came
back<00:03:39.739> we<00:03:40.250> actually<00:03:40.609> had<00:03:40.790> two<00:03:41.389> of<00:03:41.510> our<00:03:41.630> players

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:41.660 
back we actually had two of our players

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:44.020 
back we actually had two of our players
who<00:03:42.109> weren't<00:03:42.290> there<00:03:42.530> last<00:03:42.709> year<00:03:42.920> from<00:03:43.190> 2008

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.030 
who weren't there last year from 2008

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:45.640 
who weren't there last year from 2008
come<00:03:44.269> back<00:03:44.450> again<00:03:44.660> which<00:03:44.989> really<00:03:45.290> have<00:03:45.380> helped

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:45.650 
come back again which really have helped

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:47.500 
come back again which really have helped
us<00:03:45.739> tremendously<00:03:45.920> this<00:03:46.489> year<00:03:46.700> because<00:03:47.030> of<00:03:47.269> its

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.510 
us tremendously this year because of its

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:50.080 
us tremendously this year because of its
location<00:03:47.720> in<00:03:48.260> western<00:03:48.680> ontario<00:03:48.829> a<00:03:49.549> relatively

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090 
location in western ontario a relatively

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:52.690 
location in western ontario a relatively
small<00:03:50.269> soccer<00:03:50.840> market<00:03:51.380> it's<00:03:51.829> not<00:03:52.040> likely<00:03:52.370> the

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:52.700 
small soccer market it's not likely the

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:54.970 
small soccer market it's not likely the
organization<00:03:53.450> can<00:03:53.780> get<00:03:53.989> much<00:03:54.200> bigger<00:03:54.440> than<00:03:54.590> it

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:54.980 
organization can get much bigger than it

00:03:54.980 --> 00:03:57.610 
organization can get much bigger than it
already<00:03:55.100> is<00:03:55.359> which<00:03:56.359> seems<00:03:56.690> to<00:03:56.810> be<00:03:56.900> just<00:03:57.260> fine

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.620 
already is which seems to be just fine

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:59.530 
already is which seems to be just fine
with<00:03:58.069> the<00:03:58.190> club's<00:03:58.459> brain<00:03:58.819> trust<00:03:59.180> so<00:03:59.389> our

00:03:59.530 --> 00:03:59.540 
with the club's brain trust so our

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:01.059 
with the club's brain trust so our
market<00:03:59.989> isn't<00:04:00.139> the<00:04:00.349> type<00:04:00.530> of<00:04:00.560> market<00:04:00.950> that

00:04:01.059 --> 00:04:01.069 
market isn't the type of market that

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:04.030 
market isn't the type of market that
would<00:04:01.160> probably<00:04:01.400> a<00:04:02.209> support<00:04:03.170> team<00:04:03.769> at<00:04:03.829> a

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:04.040 
would probably a support team at a

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.460 
would probably a support team at a
higher<00:04:04.250> level<00:04:04.280> than<00:04:04.700> the<00:04:04.880> PDL<00:04:05.329> so<00:04:05.900> the<00:04:06.109> PDL

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:06.470 
higher level than the PDL so the PDL

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:09.220 
higher level than the PDL so the PDL
seems<00:04:06.920> to<00:04:07.160> be<00:04:07.310> where<00:04:07.549> we'd<00:04:07.730> like<00:04:08.000> to<00:04:08.180> stay<00:04:08.389> we

00:04:09.220 --> 00:04:09.230 
seems to be where we'd like to stay we

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:11.710 
seems to be where we'd like to stay we
don't<00:04:09.650> have<00:04:09.889> any<00:04:10.099> immediate<00:04:10.459> plans<00:04:10.700> to<00:04:11.329> move

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:11.720 
don't have any immediate plans to move

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:14.740 
don't have any immediate plans to move
any<00:04:11.930> higher<00:04:12.310> although<00:04:13.310> we<00:04:13.549> have<00:04:14.060> had<00:04:14.480> some

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:14.750 
any higher although we have had some

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:16.629 
any higher although we have had some
affiliation<00:04:15.200> thought<00:04:15.590> with<00:04:15.739> Toronto<00:04:16.099> FC<00:04:16.430> from

affiliation thought with Toronto FC from

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:18.819 
affiliation thought with Toronto FC from
mls<00:04:16.940> soccer<00:04:17.209> and<00:04:17.599> perhaps<00:04:18.169> to<00:04:18.470> make<00:04:18.620> those

00:04:18.819 --> 00:04:18.829 
mls soccer and perhaps to make those

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:20.710 
mls soccer and perhaps to make those
affiliation<00:04:19.400> stronger

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:20.720 
affiliation stronger

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.330 
affiliation stronger
and<00:04:20.780> maybe<00:04:21.350> more<00:04:21.620> of<00:04:21.739> a<00:04:21.829> player<00:04:22.040> movement

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:22.340 
and maybe more of a player movement

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.220 
and maybe more of a player movement
between<00:04:22.640> the<00:04:22.910> two<00:04:23.060> organizations<00:04:23.780> as<00:04:23.930> some<00:04:24.140> of
