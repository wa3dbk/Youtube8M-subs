beautiful cream leather and brown
packaging<00:00:48.230> and<00:00:49.230> so<00:00:49.590> I<00:00:49.950> was<00:00:50.640> thinking<00:00:51.030> whether

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:51.270 
packaging and so I was thinking whether

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:53.779 
packaging and so I was thinking whether
I<00:00:51.420> should<00:00:51.570> go<00:00:51.960> for<00:00:52.289> a<00:00:52.350> silver<00:00:53.219> watch<00:00:53.489> with

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
I should go for a silver watch with

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.779 
I should go for a silver watch with
black<00:00:54.120> leather<00:00:54.960> band<00:00:55.410> but<00:00:56.309> then<00:00:56.430> I<00:00:56.489> thought

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
black leather band but then I thought

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.779 
black leather band but then I thought
I'm<00:00:56.940> not<00:00:56.969> wearing<00:00:57.600> silver<00:00:57.960> anymore<00:00:58.920> I<00:00:59.129> love<00:00:59.579> my

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
I'm not wearing silver anymore I love my

gold<00:01:00.090> and<00:01:00.270> rose<00:01:00.510> gold<00:01:00.570> so<00:01:01.109> I<00:01:01.140> thought<00:01:01.410> it<00:01:01.590> would

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
gold and rose gold so I thought it would

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.039 
gold and rose gold so I thought it would
probably<00:01:02.100> be<00:01:02.520> silly<00:01:03.000> to<00:01:03.180> get<00:01:03.329> another<00:01:03.719> rose

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049 
probably be silly to get another rose

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.679 
probably be silly to get another rose
gold<00:01:04.350> watch<00:01:04.619> with<00:01:05.309> simply<00:01:05.939> a<00:01:05.970> different<00:01:06.450> band
