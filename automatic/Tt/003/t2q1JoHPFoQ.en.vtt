I parted this one I'm going to take the

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:44.189 
I parted this one I'm going to take the
root<00:03:39.959> and<00:03:40.959> pull<00:03:41.290> it<00:03:41.379> apart<00:03:42.209> but<00:03:43.209> not<00:03:43.510> the<00:03:43.989> whole

00:03:44.189 --> 00:03:44.199 
root and pull it apart but not the whole

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:46.289 
root and pull it apart but not the whole
thing<00:03:44.739> so<00:03:44.979> you<00:03:45.069> can<00:03:45.220> see<00:03:45.340> the<00:03:45.489> tip<00:03:45.760> is<00:03:46.030> still

00:03:46.289 --> 00:03:46.299 
thing so you can see the tip is still

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:50.099 
thing so you can see the tip is still
connected<00:03:47.069> like<00:03:48.069> that<00:03:48.569> take<00:03:49.569> the<00:03:49.750> other<00:03:49.780> piece

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:50.109 
connected like that take the other piece

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:55.660 
connected like that take the other piece
do<00:03:50.349> the<00:03:50.500> same<00:03:50.709> thing

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:55.670 

00:03:55.670 --> 00:04:03.860 

still<00:03:56.240> connected<00:03:56.900> at<00:03:57.650> the<00:03:57.800> end

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:03.870 

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:08.119 

it's<00:04:04.410> an<00:04:04.680> excellent

00:04:08.129 --> 00:04:11.989 

I'm<00:04:08.519> just<00:04:08.790> pulling<00:04:09.090> at<00:04:09.390> the<00:04:09.540> root<00:04:09.749> ladies<00:04:10.999> just

00:04:11.989 --> 00:04:11.999 
I'm just pulling at the root ladies just

00:04:11.999 --> 00:04:13.160 
I'm just pulling at the root ladies just
make<00:04:12.239> sure<00:04:12.389> you<00:04:12.480> gotta<00:04:12.659> pull<00:04:12.900> it<00:04:13.019> completely

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:13.170

apart<00:04:14.209> the<00:04:15.209> individual<00:04:15.900> pieces<00:04:17.359> let's<00:04:18.359> pull

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:18.630 
apart the individual pieces let's pull

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:27.710 
apart the individual pieces let's pull
out<00:04:18.780> the<00:04:18.959> root<00:04:19.169> flip<00:04:20.039> it<00:04:20.220> up

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:27.720 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:31.970 

my<00:04:28.320> chunky<00:04:29.130> twist<00:04:29.700> out<00:04:29.970> they<00:04:30.510> threw<00:04:31.380> out<00:04:31.470> my

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:31.980 
my chunky twist out they threw out my

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:33.980 
my chunky twist out they threw out my
ears<00:04:32.220> being<00:04:32.490> natural<00:04:33.090> they<00:04:33.480> all<00:04:33.630> have<00:04:33.870> been

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:33.990 
ears being natural they all have been

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:34.990 
ears being natural they all have been
different<00:04:34.500> somehow

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:35.000 
different somehow

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:37.820 
different somehow
because<00:04:36.000> of<00:04:36.240> the<00:04:36.360> different<00:04:36.780> times<00:04:37.260> the

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:37.830 
because of the different times the

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:41.750 
because of the different times the
different<00:04:38.220> lengths<00:04:40.310> they<00:04:41.310> all<00:04:41.490> look

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:41.760 
different lengths they all look

00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:43.880 
different lengths they all look
different<00:04:41.790> but<00:04:42.390> the<00:04:42.720> technique<00:04:43.230> is<00:04:43.440> all<00:04:43.710> the

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:43.890 
different but the technique is all the

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:46.430 
different but the technique is all the
same<00:04:44.160> I<00:04:44.610> may<00:04:45.180> have<00:04:45.360> like<00:04:45.600> a<00:04:45.630> different<00:04:46.080> part<00:04:46.320> I

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:46.440 
same I may have like a different part I

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:49.340 
same I may have like a different part I
mean<00:04:46.680> I<00:04:46.710> have<00:04:46.950> a<00:04:46.980> part<00:04:47.370> at<00:04:47.490> all<00:04:47.640> in<00:04:48.000> my<00:04:48.150> hair<00:04:48.450> and

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:49.350 
mean I have a part at all in my hair and

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:52.460 
mean I have a part at all in my hair and
all<00:04:49.440> the<00:04:49.710> pins<00:04:49.950> on<00:04:50.370> how<00:04:51.240> fast<00:04:51.510> I<00:04:51.810> was<00:04:51.990> doing<00:04:52.320> it

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:52.470 
all the pins on how fast I was doing it

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:56.540 
all the pins on how fast I was doing it
or<00:04:52.680> if<00:04:52.770> I<00:04:52.920> was<00:04:53.040> rushing<00:04:54.980> alright<00:04:55.980> one<00:04:56.340> more
