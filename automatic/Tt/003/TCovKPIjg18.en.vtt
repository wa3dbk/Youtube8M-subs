lot<00:03:44.700> of<00:03:44.790> people<00:03:45.000> think<00:03:45.150> that's<00:03:45.300> backwards

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:45.510 
lot of people think that's backwards

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:48.530 
lot of people think that's backwards
because<00:03:45.840> nuts<00:03:46.260> are<00:03:46.530> high<00:03:46.560> in<00:03:47.040> fats<00:03:47.340> but<00:03:48.209> it

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540 
because nuts are high in fats but it

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.810 
because nuts are high in fats but it
seems<00:03:48.989> to<00:03:49.230> be<00:03:49.380> in<00:03:49.500> the<00:03:49.620> studies<00:03:50.010> that<00:03:50.700> the

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:50.820 
seems to be in the studies that the

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:53.600 
seems to be in the studies that the
people<00:03:51.120> who<00:03:51.209> eat<00:03:51.420> nuts<00:03:52.070> lose<00:03:53.070> more<00:03:53.400> weight

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
people who eat nuts lose more weight

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.940 
people who eat nuts lose more weight
maybe<00:03:54.450> because<00:03:54.840> they<00:03:55.019> feel<00:03:55.200> more<00:03:55.350> satisfied

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
maybe because they feel more satisfied

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:58.009 
maybe because they feel more satisfied
so<00:03:56.220> they<00:03:56.340> don't<00:03:56.489> eat<00:03:56.610> as<00:03:56.700> much<00:03:56.820> other<00:03:57.060> stuff<00:03:57.390> or

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:58.019 
so they don't eat as much other stuff or

00:03:58.019 --> 00:03:59.810 
so they don't eat as much other stuff or
maybe<00:03:58.350> there<00:03:58.560> are<00:03:58.680> compounds<00:03:59.160> in<00:03:59.489> the<00:03:59.640> nuts

00:03:59.810 --> 00:03:59.820 
maybe there are compounds in the nuts

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:01.580 
maybe there are compounds in the nuts
that<00:04:00.090> do<00:04:00.269> actually<00:04:00.450> help<00:04:00.780> their<00:04:00.989> metabolism

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
that do actually help their metabolism

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:04.580 
that do actually help their metabolism
but<00:04:02.190> whatever<00:04:02.489> the<00:04:02.670> reason<00:04:03.000> in<00:04:03.480> studies<00:04:04.380> it

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:04.590 
but whatever the reason in studies it

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:07.070 
but whatever the reason in studies it
seems<00:04:04.620> that<00:04:05.280> nuts<00:04:05.670> are<00:04:06.090> helpful<00:04:06.450> in<00:04:06.750> losing

00:04:07.070 --> 00:04:07.080 
seems that nuts are helpful in losing

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.199 
seems that nuts are helpful in losing
weight<00:04:07.230> so<00:04:07.890> I'm<00:04:08.100> super<00:04:08.459> excited<00:04:08.580> to<00:04:09.030> share
