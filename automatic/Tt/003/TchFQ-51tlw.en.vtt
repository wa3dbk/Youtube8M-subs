00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:08.230
 hi friends, well, today is my second 

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:11.049
 fasting day as I told you yesterday in the 

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:13.240
 first video I've come I've taken a 

00:00:11.049 --> 00:00:14.890
 vacation week and I've come with 

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:16.530
 this environment 

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:18.900
 wonderful 

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:21.240
 I could teach you more from here 

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.000
 views that there are that are precious is 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.160
 stone at the same time is a village in the 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.870
 province of Ã¡vila and why has it 

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.020
 come here as well as I said 

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:32.130
 also yesterday in the first video is 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:36.120
 essential when we do a fast 

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:38.220
 that we are in a state of absolute rest 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.130
 that is to say we enter with a kind of 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:43.200
 hibernation where all the functions 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:45.090
 vitals of our body level 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.460
 especially energetic they have to 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:50.010
 minimize to that for 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:51.680
 take advantage of the fast and so all that 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:55.830
 energy that we have inside of us 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:57.930
 go clean to detoxify 

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:59.670
 purify to restore the health of 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.980
 our body and the chemistry of our 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.739
 organism then it is very very very 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:07.380
 important that we are in a very environment 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.440
 calm that we are if it can be 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.850
 surrounded by nature 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.160
 we do not have to be with the burden of 

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.950
 our work our mental burdens 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.630
 and of course physical rest 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.570
 so then how good I feel is my 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:23.659
 second day today has been a little bit more 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:25.969
 difficult that yesterday although I have also 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:28.009
 I've spent it quite quiet 

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:29.479
 The advantage that I have is that here, 

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:33.439
 Well I took this week from 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:34.970
 holidays and although I do fall a little 

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:37.039
 in the be looking at the mobile 

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:39.140
 answering some mail that only the 

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:41.770
 true that I should not do it 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:44.780
 I'm more or less on vacation 

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:47.869
 then nothing very quiet reading everything 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:50.090
 the day with that feeling flames of 

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:52.729
 stomach hunger with stomach 

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:55.190
 empty and yes it's true that I also 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:58.100
 I notice a lot more tired and I feel like a 

00:01:55.190 --> 00:02:00.950
 haze on my head like it costs me 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:04.100
 move, in fact, I fell asleep 

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:06.860
 another normal nap 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:08.869
 yesterday I do not usually sleep nap I fell asleep 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.520
 a three hour nap last night I 

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:13.390
 I went to bed at twelve and I got up from 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:15.310
 nine until they're sleeping a lot 

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.870
 and well then in this state of rest 

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:18.100
 pretty quiet 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.870
 these are the symptoms that I am 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.160
 having a little bit of a feeling in the 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.730
 stomach 

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.069
 even as 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:28.430
 you do not feel like throwing up but a feeling 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:30.440
 of a little scrambled but hey these are 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.270
 normal are the symptoms of 

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:33.920
 detoxification 

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:36.200
 and good that I wanted to comment to you today 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:37.880
 some tips on fasting, well, good 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.310
 the reasons that can drive us to 

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:41.730
 do this fast 

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:44.849
 a year more recommended for all he 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.849
 because all 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:50.860
 the amount of toxins that we have 

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:54.200
 submitted our organism during 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:03:01.370
 so many years one of the main 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:03:05.890
 it's a chronic disease because as 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.890
 they can be asthma allergies 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:12.890
 and some inflammation in the stomach 

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:16.830
 psoriasis skin diseases 

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:19.350
 liver problems gallstones is 

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:22.760
 say any illness the fast is 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:22.760
 It is the best way 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:27.530
 unless there is already some damage 

00:03:25.879 --> 00:03:30.469
 irreparable and irreversible 

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:33.049
 it is true that there are faeces of the tissues and 

00:03:30.469 --> 00:03:34.879
 the organs are damaged in such a way 

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:36.430
 that it is very difficult for them to return to their 

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:38.170
 original state 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:42.129
 then it shows one of the main 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:44.049
 reasons the second then to establish 

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:47.590
 just like as a medicine 

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:50.409
 preventive to reestablish this health 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:52.460
 by eliminating toxins and 

00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:55.070
 to heal our organism 

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:57.890
 that is, we all have accumulated 

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:59.930
 toxins in our in our body already 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:02.260
 over all these years we have not 

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:05.750
 could eliminate that is the balance 

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:08.150
 we usually ingest and accumulate some 

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:10.730
 toxins from which our body can 

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:13.220
 accumulate then we still have a lot 

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:16.070
 then accumulated through fasting 

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:18.140
 we can recover that energy again 

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:21.800
 those vital functions are going to 

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:23.150
 develop much more lightly and 

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:25.220
 after a fast then we are going to 

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:26.900
 recover much more that energy because 

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:29.900
 because we have tuned our 

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:32.120
 organs like by cleaning the filters and 

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:33.830
 put the tape to the new car as 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:36.500
 then we will let our 

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:39.830
 purify organism be cleaned and so 

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:42.590
 so I can establish much better their 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:45.350
 functions of past this fast then 

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:47.090
 another one of the reasons that can be worth 

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:50.340
 that can motivate us to do a fast 

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:53.639
 it is the spiritual connection 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:55.560
 because in the end is one week the first 

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:57.120
 it's a week just to be a few weeks 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:59.940
 Holiday in a quiet environment 

00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:02.669
 that is going to favor us that we can 

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:05.639
 but connect with ourselves and to a 

00:05:02.669 --> 00:05:07.569
 Fasting having nothing in the body 

00:05:05.639 --> 00:05:09.759
 establishes a very connection 

00:05:07.569 --> 00:05:12.339
 very deep indeed in all 

00:05:09.759 --> 00:05:14.689
 religions has always been helped and this 

00:05:12.339 --> 00:05:16.429
 It has been one of these reasons 

00:05:14.689 --> 00:05:19.729
 then I really recommend it 

00:05:16.429 --> 00:05:21.919
 because because it's a way to connect 

00:05:19.729 --> 00:05:24.679
 with you if you have to be subject to 

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:26.599
 a lot of stress, a lot of stress is an excuse 

00:05:24.679 --> 00:05:29.539
 perfect also to recover that 

00:05:26.599 --> 00:05:31.959
 emotional balance then another of the 

00:05:29.539 --> 00:05:31.959
 Causes 

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:43.460
 and you send me 

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:45.170
 it's very difficult for you to leave 

00:05:43.460 --> 00:05:47.750
 certain foods such as the 

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:50.150
 sugar how can flour be even 

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:51.890
 the alcohol the tobacco then through 

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:53.860
 of fasting our body is going to 

00:05:51.890 --> 00:05:57.230
 detoxify that all these substances 

00:05:53.860 --> 00:06:01.210
 and from there it can be a step to start 

00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:01.210
 already with a cleaner diet 

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:08.210
 It is a 

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:10.880
 our 

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:17.550
 life goes 

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:19.229
 and then, well, the last cause 

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:21.480
 It can also be to lose weight 

00:06:19.229 --> 00:06:25.689
 you want to lose weight 

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:27.370
 and a fast may be the best option of 

00:06:25.689 --> 00:06:29.800
 calories 

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:32.110
 obviously we are going to lose a lot of fat 

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:34.000
 accumulated above all the more how much 

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:36.220
 more fat we have easier we're going to 

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:40.020
 lose then this should not be the 

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:40.020
 purpose of the fast but one 

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:46.350
 forgive a side effect of fasting 

00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:48.120
 which is also very good because if 

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:50.940
 we have accumulated fat is useless 

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:53.550
 have it but yes that is true a lot 

00:06:50.940 --> 00:06:56.120
 People who are overweight may be 

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:58.340
 a motorbike 

00:06:56.120 --> 00:07:00.889
 so nothing friends then from here you 

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:03.310
 I send another very strong kiss tomorrow 

00:07:00.889 --> 00:07:06.430
 record and another video of the third day of 

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:08.860
 of the fast and I will tell you also then 

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:14.400
 more more tips and more more information 

00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:14.400
 about fasting if you have a happy day
