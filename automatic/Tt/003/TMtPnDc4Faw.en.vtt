00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:03.980
 idiots 

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:09.900
 we will realize the pose a 

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.240
 milling in renovation so firstly 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:17.820
 we control the dimensions code 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:20.610
 passage so here's 1160 we're going 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:23.240
 do the same thing for height and 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:28.710
 we control on holding three 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:35.370
 renovation then the control makes us 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:36.690
 remove the old ones opening once 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.989
 the others have taken off we're going 

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.510
 restore the seal between the frame 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:43.920
 and masonry 

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:48.140
 if we allow to have a seal at 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:51.120
 the air and to the water we go to him this is 

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:53.960
 once the seal is done we will 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.960
 install the furs 

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:59.300
 we install the holds 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:06.350
 we are going to set up the fund of 

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:10.220
 June before the establishment of Norman 

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:13.040
 in the carpentry and then we 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:16.400
 put the frame in place then we 

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:18.200
 let's go to the piercing the piercing is done to 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:25.940
 every point of rotation ie 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:28.640
 attack bommel so here we are two 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:32.180
 levels once my first life semi to 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:38.990
 level of my time I control the 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:40.460
 distribution then the second vice and 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.700
 from there I redo a second 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:46.310
 control that allows me to insure my 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:52.880
 provision and after I put the 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:55.220
 third once my third life 

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.410
 settles in and I control 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:01.630
 lighting my sleeping frame taking 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:04.480
 the diagonals from one point to another 

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:06.410
 that they provide lighting 

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:12.830
 before putting the wooden setting of 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:15.800
 opening once the diagonals taken 

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:19.700
 and control does I make myself a point 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:24.160
 to avoid losing my 

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.160
 points when tightening other screws 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:34.920
 then we will put the opening 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:34.920
 in Normandy 

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:46.490
 so there that allows us to control 

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:50.900
 the alignment of the two openings on 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:57.770
 control done we finish fixing 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:03:01.330
 of the sleeping frame we control the amount 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:03.500
 with a rule on the inner letters 

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:11.440
 here is the same operation 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:14.989
 other amounts the fixation completed 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:17.360
 we access the external waterproofness 

00:03:14.989 --> 00:03:19.160
 so here we are going to realize the 

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.310
 the tightness on the back shows the 

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:24.310
 existing dormant and the dormant 

00:03:21.310 --> 00:03:24.310
 renovation 

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:41.920
 then we will go to the stage of 

00:03:37.939 --> 00:03:41.920
 the setting up of exterior cladding 

00:04:08.829 --> 00:04:21.289
 once the skins installed we 

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:23.660
 let's go to sealing 

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:24.949
 finish on all three sides and not alone 

00:04:23.660 --> 00:04:25.520
 through this bass so she can 

00:04:24.949 --> 00:04:28.009
 breathe 

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:34.039
 we remove the protections on the 

00:04:28.009 --> 00:04:36.409
 opening and on the round back once the 

00:04:34.039 --> 00:04:40.610
 protections removed we remove the 

00:04:36.409 --> 00:04:45.080
 novice holds and secondly we 

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:49.820
 let's break the part above the calle 

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:52.010
 who has the role precisely of blocker for 

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:57.440
 have more freedom at the level of 

00:04:52.010 --> 00:05:00.699
 blocking system we will install 

00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:00.699
 then the handle 

00:05:04.499 --> 00:05:07.740
 and here
