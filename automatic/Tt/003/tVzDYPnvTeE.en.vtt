actually start blocking terrace out we
really<00:03:37.580> started<00:03:37.910> to<00:03:38.000> push<00:03:38.300> what<00:03:38.960> we<00:03:39.110> could<00:03:39.290> do

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:39.410 
really started to push what we could do

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:41.200 
really started to push what we could do
with<00:03:39.770> the<00:03:39.950> vertical<00:03:40.070> nest<00:03:40.550> then<00:03:40.880> everybody

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:41.210 
with the vertical nest then everybody

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:43.750 
with the vertical nest then everybody
saw<00:03:41.330> like<00:03:41.600> oh<00:03:41.720> my<00:03:41.780> god<00:03:42.170> it<00:03:42.770> looks<00:03:43.010> great<00:03:43.340> so<00:03:43.670> we
