ah<00:00:00.170> this<00:00:01.170> is<00:00:01.350> preposterous<00:00:02.520> I<00:00:02.550> think<00:00:03.300> you're

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:03.449 
ah this is preposterous I think you're

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:04.999 
ah this is preposterous I think you're
giving<00:00:03.720> me<00:00:03.840> these<00:00:03.990> tasks<00:00:04.410> because<00:00:04.650> you're

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
giving me these tasks because you're

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:05.960 
giving me these tasks because you're
afraid<00:00:05.130> if<00:00:05.400> you<00:00:05.490> give<00:00:05.670> me<00:00:05.790> anything

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970 
afraid if you give me anything

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.530 
afraid if you give me anything
meaningful<00:00:06.750> to<00:00:06.899> do<00:00:07.080> I'll<00:00:07.290> show<00:00:07.319> you<00:00:07.560> up<00:00:08.540> really

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
meaningful to do I'll show you up really

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.089 
meaningful to do I'll show you up really
is<00:00:09.960> that<00:00:10.230> what<00:00:10.440> you<00:00:10.590> think

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099 
is that what you think

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.370 
is that what you think
yes<00:00:11.340> that's<00:00:11.820> what<00:00:12.030> I<00:00:12.059> think<00:00:12.450> and<00:00:12.690> I'm<00:00:13.019> super

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
yes that's what I think and I'm super

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:16.090 
yes that's what I think and I'm super
smart<00:00:13.500> so<00:00:13.769> it's<00:00:13.889> probably<00:00:14.160> true

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:16.100 
smart so it's probably true

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:18.320 
smart so it's probably true
hey<00:00:17.100> I've<00:00:17.279> been<00:00:17.430> training<00:00:17.820> in<00:00:17.910> the<00:00:18.000> field<00:00:18.150> of

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
hey I've been training in the field of

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.420 
hey I've been training in the field of
Neurobiology<00:00:18.570> for<00:00:19.199> 12<00:00:19.500> years<00:00:19.830> you've<00:00:20.250> been

Neurobiology for 12 years you've been

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:21.950 
Neurobiology for 12 years you've been
here<00:00:20.580> for<00:00:20.760> three<00:00:20.789> hours<00:00:21.150> and<00:00:21.480> you<00:00:21.570> spent<00:00:21.810> one

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:21.960 
here for three hours and you spent one

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.160 
here for three hours and you spent one
of<00:00:22.080> them<00:00:22.170> in<00:00:22.289> the<00:00:22.350> bathroom<00:00:22.910> I'm<00:00:23.910> sorry<00:00:24.600> it

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:25.170 
of them in the bathroom I'm sorry it

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:26.660 
of them in the bathroom I'm sorry it
takes<00:00:25.380> me<00:00:25.619> a<00:00:25.650> while<00:00:25.769> to<00:00:25.920> get<00:00:26.039> things<00:00:26.220> going<00:00:26.580> on

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:26.670 
takes me a while to get things going on

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.380 
takes me a while to get things going on
unfamiliar<00:00:27.180> toilet<00:00:28.970> Sheldon<00:00:29.970> I've<00:00:30.060> given<00:00:30.300> you

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
unfamiliar toilet Sheldon I've given you

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:31.820 
unfamiliar toilet Sheldon I've given you
the<00:00:30.539> simplest<00:00:30.929> things<00:00:31.199> to<00:00:31.380> do<00:00:31.560> and<00:00:31.740> you

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
the simplest things to do and you

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:33.740 
the simplest things to do and you
haven't<00:00:32.160> done<00:00:32.279> one<00:00:32.520> of<00:00:32.640> them<00:00:32.790> right<00:00:32.969> maybe

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
haven't done one of them right maybe

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.330 
haven't done one of them right maybe
that's<00:00:33.930> because<00:00:34.079> I'm<00:00:34.380> not<00:00:34.530> being<00:00:34.770> challenged

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
that's because I'm not being challenged

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.160 
that's because I'm not being challenged
it's<00:00:35.760> the<00:00:35.940> same<00:00:36.180> reason<00:00:36.329> Einstein<00:00:36.930> failed

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
it's the same reason Einstein failed

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.200 
it's the same reason Einstein failed
math<00:00:37.500> maybe<00:00:37.980> the<00:00:38.129> math<00:00:38.280> was<00:00:38.460> too<00:00:38.579> bubbly<00:00:38.850> for

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:39.210 
math maybe the math was too bubbly for

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.200 
math maybe the math was too bubbly for
him<00:00:40.129> you<00:00:41.129> think<00:00:41.250> you're<00:00:41.430> doing<00:00:41.579> science<00:00:42.059> by

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
him you think you're doing science by

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.880 
him you think you're doing science by
cutting<00:00:42.510> up<00:00:42.629> that<00:00:42.660> brain<00:00:43.079> I<00:00:43.469> could<00:00:43.649> do<00:00:43.800> the

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
cutting up that brain I could do the

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:46.069 
cutting up that brain I could do the
same<00:00:44.070> thing<00:00:44.280> at<00:00:44.399> any<00:00:44.489> Quiznos<00:00:45.059> and<00:00:45.510> they'd

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
same thing at any Quiznos and they'd

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:50.420 
same thing at any Quiznos and they'd
offer<00:00:46.350> to<00:00:46.440> toast<00:00:46.649> it<00:00:46.829> for<00:00:47.010> me<00:00:47.129> too<00:00:49.160> okay<00:00:50.160> smart

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
offer to toast it for me too okay smart

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.430 
offer to toast it for me too okay smart
guy<00:00:50.489> I'm<00:00:51.180> about<00:00:51.239> to<00:00:51.690> remove<00:00:51.930> the<00:00:52.170> locus

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
guy I'm about to remove the locus

guy I'm about to remove the locus
coeruleus<00:00:52.469> which<00:00:53.100> is<00:00:53.250> incredibly<00:00:53.910> delicate

00:00:54.049 --> 00:00:54.059 
coeruleus which is incredibly delicate

00:00:54.059 --> 00:01:00.279 
coeruleus which is incredibly delicate
work<00:00:55.070> have<00:00:56.070> at<00:00:56.219> it<00:00:57.949> all<00:00:58.949> right

work have at it all right
I'm<00:01:01.289> no<00:01:01.440> stranger<00:01:02.129> to<00:01:02.160> a<00:01:02.340> little<00:01:02.550> gray<00:01:02.730> matter

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:06.470 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:14.960 

locus<00:01:07.470> coeruleus<00:01:11.450> locus<00:01:12.450> really<00:01:13.970> you're

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
locus coeruleus locus really you're

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.030 
locus coeruleus locus really you're
getting<00:01:15.090> warmer<00:01:15.570> it<00:01:15.689> is<00:01:15.810> indeed<00:01:16.170> in<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:16.560> brain

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:19.040 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.560 

hope<00:01:20.040> your<00:01:20.159> hands<00:01:20.310> are<00:01:20.460> steady<00:01:20.610> it's<00:01:21.420> the

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
hope your hands are steady it's the

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.780 
hope your hands are steady it's the
width<00:01:21.720> of<00:01:21.810> a<00:01:21.900> single<00:01:21.930> hair<00:01:22.229> but<00:01:22.710> this<00:01:23.280> is<00:01:23.460> just

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
width of a single hair but this is just

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.340 
width of a single hair but this is just
biology<00:01:23.970> so<00:01:24.450> I'm<00:01:24.540> sure<00:01:24.689> it's<00:01:24.840> no<00:01:24.960> problem<00:01:25.170> for

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
biology so I'm sure it's no problem for

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.679 
biology so I'm sure it's no problem for
a<00:01:25.500> genius<00:01:25.799> like<00:01:25.979> you<00:01:26.100> it's<00:01:26.430> not<00:01:26.759> I'll<00:01:27.180> have<00:01:27.509> you

know in the field of physics we work

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.310 
know in the field of physics we work
with<00:01:29.700> particles<00:01:30.150> so<00:01:30.270> small<00:01:30.299> they<00:01:30.840> make<00:01:31.020> fat

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:31.320
