00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:18.883
The Boo in the Shoe

00:00:19.133 --> 00:00:20.717
By Kuzhali Manickavel

00:00:20.717 --> 00:00:25.050
By Kuzhali Manickavel

00:00:27.883 --> 00:00:31.467
Have you ever seen Boos?

00:00:31.467 --> 00:00:33.717
They are playful creatures

00:00:33.717 --> 00:00:35.133
you think

00:00:35.133 --> 00:00:36.467
you see

00:00:36.467 --> 00:00:38.550
under your bed at night.

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.383
Some look like

00:00:40.383 --> 00:00:42.133
orange zebras,

00:00:42.133 --> 00:00:43.050
others

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.883
like flying snails.

00:00:45.883 --> 00:00:47.967
They can tease

00:00:47.967 --> 00:00:50.467
or make you sneeze -

00:00:50.467 --> 00:00:51.550
they can even make

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:53.300
chocolates appear in

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.300
empty pockets!

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.133
Puzzle, the Boo

00:00:58.133 --> 00:00:59.467
looked a bit

00:00:59.467 --> 00:01:01.800
like an elephant,

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.967
only he was purple

00:01:03.967 --> 00:01:05.633
most of the time

00:01:05.633 --> 00:01:09.967
and the size of a mouse.

00:01:09.967 --> 00:01:11.883
Meera stumbled upon him

00:01:11.883 --> 00:01:15.633
one morning by accident.

00:01:15.633 --> 00:01:16.883
There he was,

00:01:16.883 --> 00:01:18.717
sniffing and moaning,

00:01:18.717 --> 00:01:19.967
his backside

00:01:19.967 --> 00:01:21.133
firmly wedged

00:01:21.133 --> 00:01:26.133
inside her shoe.

00:01:26.967 --> 00:01:29.300
“I must be dreaming,”

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:30.967
she thought.

00:01:30.967 --> 00:01:33.050
She poked him

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:35.633
to see what would happen.

00:01:35.633 --> 00:01:36.883
“Ouch!”

00:01:36.883 --> 00:01:40.633
howled Puzzle.

00:01:40.633 --> 00:01:43.300
“Oh! I’m very sorry,”

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.717
she apologized.

00:01:46.717 --> 00:01:49.633
“I’m stuck!”

00:01:49.633 --> 00:01:51.800
he bawled.

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:52.800
In fact,

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:53.800
he had been

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.800
stuck there all night

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:58.467
and had given up hope

00:01:58.467 --> 00:02:01.800
of ever getting free.

00:02:03.633 --> 00:02:09.550
Meera examined him closely.

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.217
“Let me see if I

00:02:11.217 --> 00:02:12.800
can help,”

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.800
she said,

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:20.050
pulling him by the legs.

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:24.383
She pushed him from behind.

00:02:24.383 --> 00:02:26.467
She even banged the shoe

00:02:26.467 --> 00:02:31.467
against the floor.

00:02:33.383 --> 00:02:37.383
“I could put you in soapy water,”

00:02:37.383 --> 00:02:41.300
she suggested.

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:47.633
No, Puzzle was scared of bubbles.

00:02:47.633 --> 00:02:49.467
“What if I

00:02:49.467 --> 00:02:52.133
poured oil on you?”

00:02:52.133 --> 00:02:53.467
she asked.

00:02:53.467 --> 00:02:57.717
Puzzle began to squeak and sob.

00:02:57.717 --> 00:02:59.800
He certainly didn’t want oil

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:03.550
poured on him!

00:03:07.383 --> 00:03:11.467
“I know how to stop you from crying!”

00:03:11.467 --> 00:03:15.300
Meera shouted merrily.

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:19.717
She started to tickle Puzzle.

00:03:19.717 --> 00:03:21.883
Boos are very ticklish,

00:03:21.883 --> 00:03:22.800
and soon

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:27.883
he was squirming and giggling.

00:03:27.883 --> 00:03:30.383
The more Meera tickled him,

00:03:30.383 --> 00:03:32.717
the more he squirmed

00:03:32.717 --> 00:03:36.300
until suddenly...

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:39.217
“Look! You’re unstuck!”

00:03:39.217 --> 00:03:43.967
cried Meera excitedly, clapping her hands.

00:03:43.967 --> 00:03:47.300
Puzzle blinked.

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:50.217
He wiggled his legs.

00:03:50.217 --> 00:03:53.467
He wiggled his tail.

00:03:53.467 --> 00:03:55.300
Then he wiggled his whole body,

00:03:55.300 --> 00:04:00.217
just to make sure.

00:04:00.217 --> 00:04:03.883
“Yay! I’m free!”

00:04:03.883 --> 00:04:05.717
he trumpeted

00:04:05.717 --> 00:04:09.383
as he bounced around the room.

00:04:09.383 --> 00:04:11.467
He bounced onto her hand

00:04:11.467 --> 00:04:15.217
and smiled.

00:04:15.217 --> 00:04:17.050
“What would you like

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:19.217
before I go?

00:04:19.217 --> 00:04:22.050
Chocolates?

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:23.550
Shall I make your

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:27.133
school disappear?”

00:04:27.133 --> 00:04:30.217
“Do you have to go?”

00:04:30.217 --> 00:04:33.967
asked Meera sadly.

00:04:33.967 --> 00:04:37.300
“I wish you could stay.

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:42.467
We could be friends!”

00:04:42.467 --> 00:04:46.550
Boos didn’t have human friends.

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:49.133
“That’s a great idea!”

00:04:49.133 --> 00:04:51.717
he squeaked.

00:04:51.717 --> 00:04:53.050
“Just say

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:55.300
‘Puzzle the Boo, I want to see you’

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:57.217
and I’ll come!”

00:04:57.217 --> 00:05:00.717
“Promise?” she asked

00:05:00.717 --> 00:05:01.883
“I promise!”

00:05:01.883 --> 00:05:05.050
winked Puzzle.

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:06.800
The school bus

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:09.800
honked loudly.

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.550
“Okay, we’ll play after school.

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:13.967
See you later!”

00:05:13.967 --> 00:05:18.050
she said as she rushed outside.

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:19.467
After school,

00:05:19.467 --> 00:05:24.967
Meera went to the garden.

00:05:24.967 --> 00:05:26.383
She shut her eyes

00:05:26.383 --> 00:05:30.967
and murmured the magic words.

00:05:34.217 --> 00:05:37.717
There was a humming sound,

00:05:37.717 --> 00:05:44.300
and Puzzle appeared in a flash!

00:05:45.633 --> 00:05:46.883
They laughed

00:05:46.883 --> 00:05:50.633
and played until sunset.

00:05:50.633 --> 00:05:52.300
And from that day on,

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:54.550
Meera and Puzzle

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:57.967
became best friends.
