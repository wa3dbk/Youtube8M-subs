 and very average even though I 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:08.130
 I was thinking why it's only in the off 

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:11.610
 road that it stands out an asphalt that 

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:13.860
 also surprising is that the new grand 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:16.080
 cherokee who is benefiting from 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.970
 development during the 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.180
 when he was behind the 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:22.920
 command of german mercedes benz 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:26.099
 incorporated the European philosophy 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.289
 of sports utility vehicles, ie 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:31.439
 vehicles that are more day-to-day 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.600
 and is successful in the United States and 

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:36.450
 rest of the world material 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:40.440
 quality and well done shot 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:41.550
 make it look like the car taken and 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.090
 it 's not an exaggeration 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:46.980
 brushed steel wood appliquÃ©s 

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:49.320
 Rubberized plastic and 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.989
 leather plus all the treats that a 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:54.510
 Such a car demands how to give from 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.510
 opening the door with the key in the pocket gives a 

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:00.210
 feeling of being in a luxurious sedan like 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:03.329
 gained nearly 14 inches in the distance 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:05.250
 between them and the previous model 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:08.159
 the internal space is good for five 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:10.080
 adults but the trunk should be a 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.450
 little bigger for a car with a proposal 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.470
 family with independent suspension in the 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.540

 with those old boats north

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:29.409
 those released in the old models and 

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:32.810

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:37.340
 curves very well and it's something tight has 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:39.530
 electronic controls for stability and 

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.570
