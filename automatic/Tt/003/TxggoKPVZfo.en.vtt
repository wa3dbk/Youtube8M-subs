00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:41.400 
game is amazing anything it's not time

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.160

they got a ton more people in on it and
again<00:01:44.040> this<00:01:44.340> is<00:01:44.490> definitely<00:01:44.850> something<00:01:45.030> that

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
again this is definitely something that

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:46.969

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.610 
around the corner it goes without saying
that<00:02:54.390> will<00:02:54.569> be<00:02:54.660> playing<00:02:54.930> award<00:02:55.290> here<00:02:55.500> on

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:55.620 
that will be playing award here on

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:57.559 
that will be playing award here on
YouTube<00:02:55.980> and<00:02:56.160> on<00:02:56.700> Twitter<00:02:57.000> whatever<00:02:57.269> comes

00:02:57.559 --> 00:02:57.569 
YouTube and on Twitter whatever comes

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:59.809 
YouTube and on Twitter whatever comes
afterward<00:02:58.110> as<00:02:58.260> well<00:02:58.470> and<00:02:58.860> because<00:02:59.459> it<00:02:59.580> was

00:02:59.809 --> 00:02:59.819 
afterward as well and because it was

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:01.070 
afterward as well and because it was
mentioned<00:03:00.269> that<00:03:00.360> the<00:03:00.480> blizzard<00:03:00.780> guys<00:03:00.930> are

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
mentioned that the blizzard guys are

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:03.289 
mentioned that the blizzard guys are
already<00:03:01.380> working<00:03:01.709> in<00:03:02.100> somewhere<00:03:02.910> on<00:03:03.120> the

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:03.299 
already working in somewhere on the

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:05.470 
already working in somewhere on the
expansion<00:03:03.900> after<00:03:04.410> wall<00:03:04.620> onto<00:03:04.769> greener<00:03:05.069> and

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:05.480 
expansion after wall onto greener and

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:07.820 
expansion after wall onto greener and
this<00:03:06.480> to<00:03:06.630> me<00:03:06.720> implies<00:03:07.080> that<00:03:07.110> they<00:03:07.380> are<00:03:07.500> finally

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830 
this to me implies that they are finally

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:09.410 
this to me implies that they are finally
making<00:03:07.950> good<00:03:08.250> on<00:03:08.370> their<00:03:08.430> funds<00:03:08.790> to<00:03:09.269> start

00:03:09.410 --> 00:03:09.420 
making good on their funds to start

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.660 
making good on their funds to start
releasing<00:03:09.690> expansions<00:03:10.410> quicker<00:03:10.650> and<00:03:11.100> which

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
releasing expansions quicker and which

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:13.310 
releasing expansions quicker and which
of<00:03:11.700> course<00:03:11.850> is<00:03:12.150> awesome<00:03:12.540> if<00:03:12.840> it<00:03:13.019> turns<00:03:13.200> out
