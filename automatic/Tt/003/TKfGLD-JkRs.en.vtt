00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:05.190
 con when we have this cut becomes very 

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.540
 hard but I can not receive theret and well 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:07.919
 by bernard thibault my doctor 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.870

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:17.780
 so when you're at the hairdresser's 

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:18.950
 first step just after putting on 

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:22.550
 seven you what makes it look like 

00:00:18.950 --> 00:00:24.170
 nothing his shampoos and there the question 

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.000
 that I ask myself that's why we ski 

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:27.020
 private field because me when we say 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.669

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:30.259

 then the part then on the other hand if a 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.190
 thing that must be understood is 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.269
 that hairdressers are not super 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:51.469

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.780
 went to the hairdresser 

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:15.519
 I went to the hairdresser's a 

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:17.230
 Recurrent source at the hairdresser is 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:18.670

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:30.700
 little gentleman of trend is not 

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:36.040

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:46.840
 somewhere and then when the hairdresser has 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:48.459
 finished his job he always makes a 

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:50.110
 weird little thing he takes his 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:50.410

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:51.700

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.120
