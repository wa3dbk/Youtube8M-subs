00:00:08.599 --> 00:00:16.560
 once around the world by car 

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:20.609
 76,000 kilometers through six continents 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.480
 and 26 states an adventure where I am 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.000
 wants to be there 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:26.359
 on the twelfth stage through africa 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.359
 it worked 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:35.040
 livingston zambia 4000 kilometers 

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.250
 in front of me I am said omerovic coast 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:39.840
 but my friends just say 

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.910
 next to our camera equipment we have 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.030
 also a wheel bearing for our touareg in 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.520
 luggage to Zimbabwe on the border the 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.559
 First highlight the famous victoria 

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.489
 Afterwards it goes to the workshop 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.489
 change rad stock 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:00.210
 harrys workshop in livingston 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.400
 So I can give you an advice 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.770
 Should you ever happen to be in Zambia 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:07.229
 with a touareg have a breakdown call 

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:07.800
 she harry at the flies everything again 

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:09.540
 together 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.640
 Let yourself be part of it 

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.890
 House does not scare you too 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.270
 spare part is there although the boys 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.990
 never seen a touareg here 

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:22.110
 If I'm not mistaken, it costs so 

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:24.119
 a dare around 497,000 rand in south africa 

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.399
 if you bring them here then 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:28.290
 another 25 percent on top 

00:01:26.399 --> 00:01:33.300
 there you can imagine what the here 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:34.920
 then they are unattainable for most 

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:36.660
 even though harry never has one here 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.170
 repaired touareg we have full 

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:42.990
 trust 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:45.390
 what else is left to us that 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.880
 first target is windhoek namibia where we 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.009
 the other participants will meet in 2000 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:53.009
 kilometer gravel road no traffic jam no 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:55.220
 no sunday drivers and always 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.220
 straight 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:05.290
 suddenly nothing works 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:07.180
 stays in the middle of Namibian nowhere 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:08.679
 one of the tracks and almost at 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:10.690
 30 degrees in the shade 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:13.860
 gabi our tour guide gives it all 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.860
 effort to get the car afloat again 

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.700
 Unfortunately 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.390
 who else 

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:45.530
 marina davila 

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.940
 she tries the strap with tape 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.750
 the alternator to temporarily 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.100
 repair 

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:53.630
 maybe we'll make it until after 

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:59.090
 Windhoek worries whether the alternator is charging 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:03:00.709
 but of course she does not do it that way 

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:03.320
 A car is then at home in a world 

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:07.120
 that the security gives if yours 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:07.120
 car slack you make sleep 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:14.720
 but maybe you did not give it to her 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.100
 the battery decides now in 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.660
 swap torex 

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:19.550
 but you have to do this first 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:21.670
 once got out of my oli 

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:24.440
 cameraman is getting uncool 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:26.720
 but rescue from aichach is approaching 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.790
 Augsburg happened to have an audi dealer 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.410
 a landrover thank you at this point 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:31.820
 at the nice mens the middle of 

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:37.910
 nowhere, and even that 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:39.590
 suitable tool has the 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:41.330
 alternator still does not charge but 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:43.550
 at least we have a full one now 

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:44.870
 battery now it says so little electricity 

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:46.730
 as possible to consume 

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:49.630
 for the remaining 300 kilometers after 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:49.630
 to create windhoek 

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:59.400
 windhuk namibia finally back 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:59.400
 civilization 

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:07.430
 the next morning we meet the 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:09.200
 other tour participants with the 

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:11.420
 inferior fuel in africa 

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:11.870
 our r5 diesel are surprisingly good 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:15.459
 deal 

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:15.459
 Let's go to South Africa 

00:04:23.860 --> 00:04:28.659
 500 kilometer we drive every day the 

00:04:27.159 --> 00:04:30.699
 travel through the former german 

00:04:28.659 --> 00:04:32.199
 colony takes us over the whole mountain 

00:04:30.699 --> 00:04:33.879
 not just an awesome sight through 

00:04:32.199 --> 00:04:41.050
 the many curves also a driving 

00:04:33.879 --> 00:04:43.169
 challenge for the tuaregs is over 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:45.069
 all the dust is a challenge 

00:04:43.169 --> 00:04:46.300
 unfortunately not working properly with 

00:04:45.069 --> 00:04:48.370
 water with dust, too, can not 

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:50.409
 so for example here is the 

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:51.639
 hoses placed there by the sucking 

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:53.610
 air from higher up 

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:56.139
 and up is 90 years missing 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:58.360
 put clown filter when air 

00:04:56.139 --> 00:05:00.610
 The air is sucked in a circle 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:03.069
 so will be the big particles 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:04.419
 Just get out of business and 

00:05:03.069 --> 00:05:07.419
 stay up that means it's coming soon 

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:09.340
 the motor via added a further 

00:05:07.419 --> 00:05:12.400
 reinforced underrun protection and others 

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:14.830
 ripen the special at the 360 Â° high it 

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:16.150
 there is no strict route so 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:20.740
 let's get one on the way 

00:05:16.150 --> 00:05:22.360
 a detour into the namibian desert 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:24.520
 few team robbing change of 

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:28.600
 landscape of huge dunes on the horizon and 

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:31.120
 The road slowly disappears in the sand 

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:33.040
 in front of us the biggest ones unfold 

00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:36.150
 sand dunes of the world nice for the eye 

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:36.150
 bad for the cars 

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:47.289
 The dust is a lot of liquid and everywhere 

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:50.770
 buried in warschau or covered 

00:05:47.289 --> 00:05:52.720
 everything is completely dusty really 

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:53.410
 have waterproof in the water lays here 

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:56.680
 down to it 

00:05:53.410 --> 00:05:58.750
 already a little dust layer outside 

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:01.509
 we are building the sossusvlei national park 

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:03.639
 our night camp in the middle of the pampa 

00:06:01.509 --> 00:06:06.419
 a pity the adventure like this always 

00:06:03.639 --> 00:06:06.419
 become rarer 

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:23.860
 On the way we meet again and again 

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:23.860
 Buildings from the German colonial era 

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:34.130
 just before south africa lies the fish river 

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:37.070
 canyon the second largest canyon in the world 

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:39.430
 the gorges are up to 550 meters 

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:39.430
 deep 

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:59.080
 happens 

00:06:56.310 --> 00:07:01.960
 after ten days, the torex reach 

00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:04.630
 South Africa can also tour Africa 

00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:06.760
 you are about vw book for 4000 euros 

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:11.650
 cars flights meals and accommodation 

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:14.200
 including the cape of good hope 

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:16.000
 the southernmost part of africa from here 

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:17.500
 the cars are shipped to the k 

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.700
 back to the last leg 

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:21.250
 to start wolfsburg 

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:23.650
 For me, the tour is never over 

00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:25.950
 I have so much in such a short time 

00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:25.950
 seen
