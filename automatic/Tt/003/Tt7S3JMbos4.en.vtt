on Netflix body it works very well on

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.850 
on Netflix body it works very well on
the<00:01:05.159> dead<00:01:05.430> body<00:01:05.850> he<00:01:06.090> also<00:01:06.330> work<00:01:06.659> very<00:01:06.689> well<00:01:07.790> the

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 
the dead body he also work very well the

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:13.340 
the dead body he also work very well the
quality<00:01:10.860> of<00:01:11.220> thick<00:01:11.520> of<00:01:11.760> this<00:01:11.970> lens<00:01:12.270> I<00:01:12.570> would

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
quality of thick of this lens I would

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.100 
quality of thick of this lens I would
say<00:01:13.560> very<00:01:14.520> close<00:01:14.939> to<00:01:15.180> the<00:01:15.270> main<00:01:15.420> conversion

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:16.110 
say very close to the main conversion

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.260 
say very close to the main conversion
which<00:01:16.320> is<00:01:16.350> probably<00:01:16.860> two<00:01:17.430> or<00:01:17.460> three<00:01:17.580> times<00:01:17.820> in

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
which is probably two or three times in

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:24.140 
which is probably two or three times in
price<00:01:18.710> the<00:01:20.119> focal<00:01:21.619> the<00:01:22.619> autofocus<00:01:23.250> is<00:01:23.460> the

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150 
price the focal the autofocus is the

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.280 
price the focal the autofocus is the
fastest<00:01:24.950> autofocus<00:01:25.950> of<00:01:26.670> the<00:01:27.299> or<00:01:27.570> 85

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
fastest autofocus of the or 85

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:34.460 
fastest autofocus of the or 85

comparing<00:02:36.820> to<00:02:37.000> the<00:02:37.090> 70<00:02:37.510> to<00:02:37.570> 200<00:02:38.490> first<00:02:39.490> the<00:02:39.670> 70

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
comparing to the 70 to 200 first the 70

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:44.280 
comparing to the 70 to 200 first the 70
to<00:02:40.150> 200<00:02:40.330> is<00:02:41.230> much<00:02:41.920> easier<00:02:42.370> much<00:02:42.850> bigger<00:02:43.290> takes

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.290 
to 200 is much easier much bigger takes

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:47.610 
to 200 is much easier much bigger takes
much<00:02:44.470> more<00:02:44.620> space<00:02:44.950> in<00:02:45.160> my<00:02:45.280> back<00:02:45.870> the<00:02:46.870> 85<00:02:47.320> millet

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:47.620 
much more space in my back the 85 millet

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.300 
much more space in my back the 85 millet
is<00:02:48.010> a<00:02:48.310> very<00:02:49.000> small<00:02:49.360> lens<00:02:49.630> compared<00:02:50.110> to<00:02:50.230> it<00:02:50.410> so

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
is a very small lens compared to it so

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:54.660 
is a very small lens compared to it so
if<00:02:51.460> I<00:02:51.580> just<00:02:51.790> put<00:02:51.880> it<00:02:52.180> next<00:02:52.300> to<00:02:52.480> it<00:02:52.980> without<00:02:53.980> the

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
if I just put it next to it without the

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.390 
if I just put it next to it without the
lens<00:02:55.120> would<00:02:55.420> on<00:02:55.690> 72<00:02:56.410> others<00:02:56.800> to<00:02:57.070> give<00:02:57.220> you<00:02:57.340> an

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
lens would on 72 others to give you an

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:01.700 
lens would on 72 others to give you an
indication<00:02:58.740> there<00:02:59.740> you<00:02:59.920> can<00:03:00.210> easily<00:03:01.210> see<00:03:01.450> that

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:01.710 
indication there you can easily see that

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:05.900 
indication there you can easily see that
the<00:03:02.790> 85<00:03:03.790> is<00:03:03.970> very<00:03:04.480> very<00:03:04.900> small<00:03:05.170> lens

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910 
the 85 is very very small lens

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.210 
the 85 is very very small lens
compare<00:03:06.910> that<00:03:06.940> to<00:03:07.120> it<00:03:07.360> probably<00:03:08.290> a<00:03:08.650> third<00:03:08.980> of

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:09.220 
compare that to it probably a third of

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:13.530 
compare that to it probably a third of
the<00:03:09.310> size<00:03:11.130> it's<00:03:12.130> very<00:03:12.250> evidence<00:03:13.000> because<00:03:13.330> of<00:03:13.360> a

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:13.540 
the size it's very evidence because of a

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.990 
the size it's very evidence because of a
there<00:03:13.810> is<00:03:13.930> a<00:03:14.140> big<00:03:15.239> 1.4<00:03:16.239> glass<00:03:16.540> which<00:03:17.080> is<00:03:17.110> very

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:18.000 
there is a big 1.4 glass which is very

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:27.100 
there is a big 1.4 glass which is very
very<00:03:19.000> nice<00:03:20.670> but<00:03:21.670> you<00:03:22.600> know<00:03:22.810> here

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:27.110 

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:38.230 

so<00:03:27.770> yeah<00:03:28.130> I<00:03:33.610> am<00:03:35.380> obsessed<00:03:36.380> with<00:03:36.940> getting<00:03:37.940> man

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:38.240 
so yeah I am obsessed with getting man

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:41.980 
so yeah I am obsessed with getting man
in<00:03:38.390> screen<00:03:38.810> and<00:03:39.080> without<00:03:39.410> need<00:03:39.650> this<00:03:39.800> but<00:03:40.430> yeah

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:41.990 
in screen and without need this but yeah

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:44.050 
in screen and without need this but yeah
my<00:03:42.560> recommendation<00:03:43.160> is<00:03:43.280> definitely<00:03:43.790> to<00:03:43.910> get

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:44.060 
my recommendation is definitely to get

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.210 
my recommendation is definitely to get
one<00:03:44.360> of<00:03:44.480> them<00:03:44.630> under<00:03:45.140> that<00:03:45.290> Nikon<00:03:45.800> stress

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:46.220 
one of them under that Nikon stress

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.550 
one of them under that Nikon stress
release<00:03:46.760> release<00:03:47.150> not<00:03:47.330> so<00:03:47.480> long<00:03:47.630> ago<00:03:47.660> an<00:03:47.960> 85

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:48.560 
release release not so long ago an 85

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:55.450 
release release not so long ago an 85
millimeter<00:03:49.010> f-18<00:03:50.230> now<00:03:51.230> I<00:03:51.260> did<00:03:53.230> a<00:03:54.230> pre-order<00:03:54.980> on

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:55.460 
millimeter f-18 now I did a pre-order on

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:57.520 
millimeter f-18 now I did a pre-order on
that<00:03:55.760> eight<00:03:56.180> point<00:03:56.510> one<00:03:56.600> point<00:03:56.960> eight<00:03:57.230> and

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:57.530 
that eight point one point eight and

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:59.710 
that eight point one point eight and
cannot<00:03:58.310> withdraw<00:03:58.490> it<00:03:58.910> back<00:03:59.180> at<00:03:59.450> the<00:03:59.540> last

00:03:59.710 --> 00:03:59.720 
cannot withdraw it back at the last

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.650 
cannot withdraw it back at the last
minute<00:04:00.080> I<00:04:00.290> decided<00:04:00.590> to<00:04:01.130> go<00:04:01.250> for<00:04:01.460> this<00:04:01.610> one

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:02.660 
minute I decided to go for this one

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:07.690 
minute I decided to go for this one
I<00:04:02.720> had<00:04:03.350> the<00:04:03.620> rock<00:04:04.250> in<00:04:04.460> Sun<00:04:04.790> which<00:04:05.330> is<00:04:05.360> the<00:04:06.700> 85

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:07.700 
I had the rock in Sun which is the 85

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:10.240 
I had the rock in Sun which is the 85
millimeter<00:04:08.150> one<00:04:08.540> point<00:04:08.810> four<00:04:09.140> which<00:04:09.920> is<00:04:09.950> also

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:10.250 
millimeter one point four which is also

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:13.030 
millimeter one point four which is also
called<00:04:10.520> the<00:04:10.640> samyang<00:04:11.209> rocking<00:04:12.170> some<00:04:12.440> Samians

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.040 
called the samyang rocking some Samians

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.970 
called the samyang rocking some Samians
and<00:04:13.370> a<00:04:13.610> single<00:04:14.380> there<00:04:15.380> is<00:04:15.470> another<00:04:15.680> method

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:15.980 
and a single there is another method

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:18.520 
and a single there is another method
it's<00:04:16.580> exactly<00:04:16.910> the<00:04:17.000> same<00:04:17.150> that's<00:04:17.390> just<00:04:17.720> if<00:04:18.260> I'm

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:18.530 
it's exactly the same that's just if I'm

00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:22.300 
it's exactly the same that's just if I'm
wrong<00:04:18.769> for<00:04:19.040> some<00:04:19.190> reason<00:04:20.470> it<00:04:21.470> was<00:04:21.530> an<00:04:21.799> amazing

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:22.310 
wrong for some reason it was an amazing

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:24.730 
wrong for some reason it was an amazing
lens<00:04:22.520> very<00:04:23.000> very<00:04:23.540> good<00:04:23.690> the<00:04:23.780> problem<00:04:24.200> was<00:04:24.470> the

00:04:24.730 --> 00:04:24.740 
lens very very good the problem was the

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:27.670 
lens very very good the problem was the
manual<00:04:25.130> focus<00:04:25.600> are<00:04:26.600> the<00:04:26.720> lots<00:04:26.990> of<00:04:27.080> issues<00:04:27.440> with

00:04:27.670 --> 00:04:27.680 
manual focus are the lots of issues with

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:30.760 
manual focus are the lots of issues with
it<00:04:27.710> when<00:04:28.340> you<00:04:28.570> because<00:04:29.570> I<00:04:29.780> don't<00:04:30.080> really<00:04:30.470> use

00:04:30.760 --> 00:04:30.770 
it when you because I don't really use

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:32.650 
it when you because I don't really use
this<00:04:30.950> lens<00:04:31.220> for<00:04:31.370> anything<00:04:31.730> now<00:04:32.000> at<00:04:32.240> one<00:04:32.480> point

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:32.660 
this lens for anything now at one point

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:37.570 
this lens for anything now at one point
for<00:04:34.060> that<00:04:35.060> there<00:04:35.270> is<00:04:35.390> no<00:04:35.540> point<00:04:35.840> for<00:04:36.080> me<00:04:36.580> using

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:37.580 
for that there is no point for me using

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.150 
for that there is no point for me using
an<00:04:37.669> 85<00:04:38.090> millimeter<00:04:38.480> one<00:04:38.720> point<00:04:38.960> for<00:04:39.230> at<00:04:39.590> five

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:40.160 
an 85 millimeter one point for at five

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:44.890 
an 85 millimeter one point for at five
point<00:04:40.460> six<00:04:40.669> or<00:04:41.080> eight<00:04:42.700> what<00:04:43.700> are<00:04:44.390> other<00:04:44.540> to<00:04:44.780> use

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:44.900 
point six or eight what are other to use

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:47.290 
point six or eight what are other to use
a<00:04:44.950> 7200<00:04:45.950> I<00:04:46.040> probably<00:04:46.310> get<00:04:46.520> better<00:04:46.700> result<00:04:47.150> at

00:04:47.290 --> 00:04:47.300 
a 7200 I probably get better result at

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:50.050 
a 7200 I probably get better result at
f/8<00:04:47.750> with<00:04:48.140> this<00:04:48.380> and<00:04:48.680> the<00:04:48.860> needs<00:04:49.100> from<00:04:49.280> the

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:50.060 
f/8 with this and the needs from the

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:52.120 
f/8 with this and the needs from the
only<00:04:50.750> reason<00:04:51.020> I<00:04:51.110> got<00:04:51.260> this<00:04:51.410> one<00:04:51.590> is<00:04:51.770> to<00:04:51.919> play

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:52.130 
only reason I got this one is to play

00:04:52.130 --> 00:04:54.159 
only reason I got this one is to play
with<00:04:52.160> the<00:04:52.340> 1.4<00:04:53.030> and<00:04:53.060> that<00:04:53.360> is<00:04:53.540> the<00:04:53.750> only<00:04:53.870> reason

00:04:54.159 --> 00:04:54.169 
with the 1.4 and that is the only reason

00:04:54.169 --> 00:05:00.340 
with the 1.4 and that is the only reason
I<00:04:54.500> use<00:04:55.070> dissonance<00:04:57.580> apart<00:04:58.580> from<00:04:58.760> this<00:04:59.350> year

00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:00.350 
I use dissonance apart from this year

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:03.340 
I use dissonance apart from this year
out<00:05:00.500> of<00:05:00.650> focus<00:05:00.919> super<00:05:01.880> fast<00:05:02.150> super<00:05:02.660> super<00:05:03.110> fast

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:03.350 
out of focus super fast super super fast

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:06.070 
out of focus super fast super super fast
faster<00:05:04.280> than<00:05:04.310> the<00:05:04.520> competition<00:05:05.080> optical

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:06.080 
faster than the competition optical

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:10.630 
faster than the competition optical
quality<00:05:06.820> as<00:05:07.820> I<00:05:08.320> would<00:05:09.320> say<00:05:09.500> probably<00:05:09.710> in<00:05:10.130> nofa

00:05:10.630 --> 00:05:10.640 
quality as I would say probably in nofa

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:15.880 
quality as I would say probably in nofa
of<00:05:10.880> the<00:05:11.419> Nikon<00:05:12.669> 8500<00:05:13.669> Fuji<00:05:14.450> and<00:05:14.890> definitely

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:15.890
