00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:00.460 
it so that just protects it if it ever

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:01.979

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:39.280 
battery life here it's at 45% because I

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:40.860 
battery life here it's at 45% because I
have<00:01:39.460> been<00:01:39.580> using<00:01:39.760> this<00:01:39.970> now<00:01:40.180> for<00:01:40.240> two<00:01:40.660> days

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:49.120 
and I still have lots of battery life

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:52.110 
and I still have lots of battery life
which<00:01:49.390> is<00:01:50.080> a<00:01:50.200> big<00:01:50.620> step<00:01:51.220> forward<00:01:51.490> for<00:01:51.670> using

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:52.120 
which is a big step forward for using

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:53.520 
which is a big step forward for using
this<00:01:52.210> in<00:01:52.360> a<00:01:52.420> school<00:01:52.660> because<00:01:53.140> if<00:01:53.320> you<00:01:53.410> know

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:53.530 
this in a school because if you know

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.530 
this in a school because if you know
anything<00:01:53.920> about<00:01:53.980> using<00:01:54.460> laptops<00:01:55.150> in<00:01:55.300> a<00:01:55.360> school

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:55.540 
anything about using laptops in a school

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:57.870 
anything about using laptops in a school
their<00:01:55.870> batteries<00:01:56.290> drains<00:01:56.560> so<00:01:56.890> quick<00:01:57.190> that

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
their batteries drains so quick that

00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:58.920 
their batteries drains so quick that
they're<00:01:58.000> always<00:01:58.120> looking<00:01:58.360> for<00:01:58.600> places<00:01:58.780> to

00:01:58.920 --> 00:01:58.930 
they're always looking for places to

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:00.570 
they're always looking for places to
charge<00:01:59.230> so<00:01:59.530> unless<00:01:59.830> we're<00:01:59.980> getting<00:02:00.160> ready<00:02:00.340> to

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:00.580 
charge so unless we're getting ready to

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.450 
charge so unless we're getting ready to
run<00:02:01.090> outlets<00:02:01.840> to<00:02:02.020> every<00:02:02.230> desk<00:02:02.470> in<00:02:02.620> a<00:02:02.740> school<00:02:02.950> it

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:03.460 
run outlets to every desk in a school it

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.070 
run outlets to every desk in a school it
makes<00:02:03.610> it<00:02:03.700> really<00:02:03.820> awkward<00:02:03.910> so<00:02:04.600> this<00:02:04.840> has<00:02:04.960> got

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:05.080 
makes it really awkward so this has got

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:06.750 
makes it really awkward so this has got

fourth<00:04:18.010> in<00:04:18.160> line<00:04:18.190> I<00:04:18.609> think<00:04:18.880> that<00:04:19.090> idea<00:04:19.329> is

00:04:19.349 --> 00:04:19.359 
fourth in line I think that idea is

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:20.550 
fourth in line I think that idea is
gonna<00:04:19.479> go<00:04:19.660> away<00:04:19.780> with<00:04:20.049> the<00:04:20.169> fact<00:04:20.320> that

00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:20.560 
gonna go away with the fact that

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:21.750 
gonna go away with the fact that

00:06:51.129 --> 00:06:51.139 
that even look nicer since we have a

00:06:51.139 --> 00:06:52.899 
that even look nicer since we have a
high-definition<00:06:51.710> display<00:06:52.220> here

00:06:52.899 --> 00:06:52.909

here's weather and HD this will pull up

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:56.800 
here's weather and HD this will pull up
with<00:06:55.370> current<00:06:55.639> weather<00:06:55.820> for<00:06:56.060> my<00:06:56.150> location<00:06:56.479> and

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:56.810 
with current weather for my location and

00:06:56.810 --> 00:06:58.890 
with current weather for my location and
animate<00:06:57.680> it<00:06:57.800> in<00:06:57.889> a<00:06:57.949> way<00:06:58.009> that's<00:06:58.219> in<00:06:58.310> hi-def

00:06:58.890 --> 00:06:58.900 
animate it in a way that's in hi-def

00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:01.180 
animate it in a way that's in hi-def
they're<00:06:59.900> just<00:07:00.080> partly<00:07:00.349> cloudy<00:07:00.650> that's<00:07:01.070> what

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:01.190 
they're just partly cloudy that's what

00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:05.649 
they're just partly cloudy that's what
it<00:07:01.280> looks<00:07:01.430> like<00:07:03.190> go<00:07:04.190> over<00:07:04.759> to<00:07:04.940> Estes<00:07:05.449> Park

00:07:05.649 --> 00:07:05.659 
it looks like go over to Estes Park

00:07:05.659 --> 00:07:07.360 
it looks like go over to Estes Park
which<00:07:05.870> is<00:07:05.990> near<00:07:06.139> Ryan<00:07:06.440> and<00:07:06.650> it's<00:07:07.070> partly

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:07.370 
which is near Ryan and it's partly

00:07:07.370 --> 00:07:08.800 
which is near Ryan and it's partly
cloudy<00:07:07.580> there<00:07:07.789> as<00:07:07.880> well<00:07:08.030> so<00:07:08.180> it<00:07:08.270> animates<00:07:08.599> in<00:07:08.690> a

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:08.810 
cloudy there as well so it animates in a

00:07:08.810 --> 00:07:10.120 
cloudy there as well so it animates in a
slightly<00:07:09.020> different<00:07:09.229> way<00:07:09.469> so<00:07:09.949> if<00:07:10.009> it's

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:10.130 
slightly different way so if it's

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:11.800 
slightly different way so if it's
snowing<00:07:10.310> outside<00:07:10.550> and<00:07:10.759> animates<00:07:11.270> beautiful

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:11.810 
snowing outside and animates beautiful

00:07:11.810 --> 00:07:14.050 
snowing outside and animates beautiful
snow<00:07:12.110> and<00:07:12.440> all<00:07:12.560> these<00:07:12.680> things<00:07:12.919> just<00:07:13.099> fantastic

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:14.060 
snow and all these things just fantastic

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:15.850 
snow and all these things just fantastic
but<00:07:14.180> they<00:07:14.270> can<00:07:14.419> do<00:07:14.570> with<00:07:15.110> a<00:07:15.139> screen<00:07:15.469> this<00:07:15.620> large

00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:15.860 
but they can do with a screen this large

00:07:15.860 --> 00:07:17.980 
but they can do with a screen this large
is<00:07:16.130> just<00:07:16.280> amazing<00:07:16.699> I<00:07:16.849> use<00:07:17.479> an<00:07:17.630> application

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:17.990 
is just amazing I use an application

00:07:17.990 --> 00:07:19.510 
is just amazing I use an application
called<00:07:18.139> things<00:07:18.530> to<00:07:18.800> keep<00:07:18.949> track<00:07:19.190> of<00:07:19.400> all<00:07:19.460> my

00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:19.520
