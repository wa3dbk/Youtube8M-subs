00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
said it came as a bit of a shock but

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.230 
said it came as a bit of a shock but
when<00:01:56.860> you<00:01:56.950> sit<00:01:57.130> down<00:01:57.220> you<00:01:57.399> think<00:01:57.640> yourself<00:01:58.030> all

00:01:58.230 --> 00:01:58.240 
when you sit down you think yourself all

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.830 
when you sit down you think yourself all

over that period of time our team is the

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.170 
over that period of time our team is the
one<00:02:02.140> in<00:02:02.619> the<00:02:02.710> history<00:02:03.220> of<00:02:03.310> forward<00:02:04.000> motor

racing in Australia

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.350 
racing in Australia
we've<00:02:06.260> won<00:02:06.410> more<00:02:06.710> races<00:02:07.100> we've<00:02:08.000> won<00:02:08.149> more

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:08.360 
we've won more races we've won more

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.900 
we've won more races we've won more
championships<00:02:08.990> and<00:02:09.259> more<00:02:09.380> battles<00:02:09.800> than<00:02:10.040> any

other<00:02:11.120> team<00:02:11.360> so<00:02:11.890> that's<00:02:12.890> why<00:02:13.040> it<00:02:13.100> becomes<00:02:13.400> a

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:13.460 
other team so that's why it becomes a

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:14.520 
other team so that's why it becomes a
bit<00:02:13.580> of<00:02:13.670> a<00:02:13.700> shock

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
bit of a shock

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:16.620 
bit of a shock
certainly<00:02:15.370> is<00:02:15.550> there's<00:02:15.790> a<00:02:15.880> lot<00:02:16.090> of<00:02:16.180> emotion

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
certainly is there's a lot of emotion

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:18.330 
certainly is there's a lot of emotion

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:19.900 
what's your take away well first of all

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.390 
what's your take away well first of all
Porter<00:02:20.230> having<00:02:20.440> a<00:02:20.500> cracker<00:02:20.800> of<00:02:20.920> a<00:02:21.040> season

we've<00:02:21.520> had<00:02:21.550> 14<00:02:22.180> races<00:02:22.480> so<00:02:23.020> far<00:02:23.050> and<00:02:23.620> they've

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
we've had 14 races so far and they've

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.070 
we've had 14 races so far and they've
won<00:02:24.069> ten<00:02:24.430> of<00:02:24.580> them<00:02:24.700> so<00:02:25.180> it<00:02:25.300> kind<00:02:25.540> of<00:02:25.630> comes<00:02:25.810> as<00:02:26.050> a

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:26.080 
won ten of them so it kind of comes as a

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:27.780 
won ten of them so it kind of comes as a
counterbalance<00:02:26.440> to<00:02:26.740> that<00:02:26.920> unfortunately

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
counterbalance to that unfortunately

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.250 
counterbalance to that unfortunately
look<00:02:28.330> I<00:02:28.420> thought<00:02:28.600> it<00:02:28.720> was<00:02:28.810> a<00:02:28.840> little<00:02:28.930> bit<00:02:29.140> odd

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
look I thought it was a little bit odd

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.290 
look I thought it was a little bit odd

00:03:03.570 --> 00:03:03.580 
hard out there to fill that gap what I

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.759 
hard out there to fill that gap what I
