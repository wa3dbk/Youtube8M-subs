00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:32.470 
you know a primer that works well but
you<00:03:31.010> don't<00:03:31.160> really<00:03:31.310> need<00:03:31.610> something<00:03:32.090> on<00:03:32.239> top

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 
you don't really need something on top

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.960 
you don't really need something on top
up<00:03:32.840> under<00:03:33.440> this<00:03:33.620> because<00:03:34.010> it's<00:03:34.310> really<00:03:34.640> really

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:34.970 
up under this because it's really really

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:42.640 
up under this because it's really really
mad<00:03:35.150> you<00:03:35.570> can<00:03:35.720> hear<00:03:35.959> it<00:03:40.360> it's<00:03:41.360> a<00:03:41.600> liquid<00:03:41.870> it<00:03:42.230> has

a strange brunch thing in it now you

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:47.560 
a strange brunch thing in it now you
look<00:03:46.310> on<00:03:46.489> the<00:03:46.640> directions<00:03:47.120> in<00:03:47.180> the<00:03:47.269> back<00:03:47.420> it

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:47.570 
look on the directions in the back it

00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:49.600 
look on the directions in the back it
says<00:03:47.750> shake<00:03:48.049> well<00:03:48.290> which<00:03:48.560> I<00:03:48.769> will<00:03:49.010> suggest<00:03:49.190> you

says shake well which I will suggest you
really<00:03:49.910> do<00:03:50.030> shake<00:03:50.269> this<00:03:50.450> up<00:03:50.630> and<00:03:50.900> apply<00:03:51.620> on

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:51.830 
really do shake this up and apply on

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:53.259 
really do shake this up and apply on
your<00:03:51.860> fingertips<00:03:52.250> and<00:03:52.610> then<00:03:52.730> apply<00:03:52.970> to<00:03:53.030> your

00:03:53.259 --> 00:03:53.269 
your fingertips and then apply to your

00:03:53.269 --> 00:03:55.840 
your fingertips and then apply to your
face<00:03:53.420> like<00:03:53.570> I<00:03:53.660> said<00:03:53.870> before<00:03:53.959> you're<00:03:54.920> expected

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:55.850 
face like I said before you're expected

00:03:55.850 --> 00:03:56.670 
face like I said before you're expected
to<00:03:55.880> use<00:03:56.120> this<00:03:56.269> as

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:56.680 
to use this as

00:03:56.680 --> 00:04:00.149 
to use this as
a<00:03:56.739> sunscreen<00:03:57.280> or<00:03:57.670> whatnot<00:03:57.849> so<00:03:58.829> they<00:03:59.829> had<00:03:59.980> this

00:04:00.149 --> 00:04:00.159 
a sunscreen or whatnot so they had this

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:02.880 
a sunscreen or whatnot so they had this
tip<00:04:00.609> brush<00:04:00.969> here<00:04:01.329> which<00:04:01.510> is<00:04:01.719> I<00:04:02.019> never<00:04:02.650> seen

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:02.890 
tip brush here which is I never seen

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:04.770 
tip brush here which is I never seen
nothing<00:04:02.920> like<00:04:03.159> this<00:04:03.280> before<00:04:03.459> so<00:04:04.060> this<00:04:04.569> was<00:04:04.750> a

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:04.780 
nothing like this before so this was a

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:07.020 
nothing like this before so this was a
little<00:04:05.079> bit<00:04:05.260> awkward<00:04:05.799> I<00:04:05.950> don't<00:04:06.129> know<00:04:06.370> I'm<00:04:06.790> not

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030 
little bit awkward I don't know I'm not

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:09.440 
little bit awkward I don't know I'm not
professional<00:04:07.659> so<00:04:07.810> I<00:04:07.840> don't<00:04:08.079> know<00:04:08.260> the

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:09.450 
professional so I don't know the

00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:12.869 
professional so I don't know the
reasoning<00:04:10.450> behind<00:04:10.510> having<00:04:11.370> this<00:04:12.370> and<00:04:12.670> not<00:04:12.819> a

00:04:12.869 --> 00:04:12.879 
reasoning behind having this and not a

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:16.529 
reasoning behind having this and not a
brush<00:04:13.450> my<00:04:14.760> assumptions<00:04:15.760> that<00:04:15.939> they<00:04:16.150> have<00:04:16.359> this

00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:16.539 
brush my assumptions that they have this

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:19.140 
brush my assumptions that they have this
little<00:04:16.750> plastic<00:04:17.680> tip<00:04:18.190> thing<00:04:18.459> instead<00:04:18.910> of<00:04:18.970> a

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:19.150 
little plastic tip thing instead of a

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:22.140 
little plastic tip thing instead of a
brush<00:04:19.479> in<00:04:19.690> it<00:04:19.989> because<00:04:20.620> it's<00:04:21.430> a<00:04:21.579> liquid<00:04:21.789> so<00:04:22.120> I

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:22.150 
brush in it because it's a liquid so I

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:25.710 
brush in it because it's a liquid so I
may<00:04:22.449> absorb<00:04:23.020> into<00:04:23.560> a<00:04:24.160> brunch<00:04:24.580> or<00:04:24.850> Bristol<00:04:25.539> if

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:25.720 
may absorb into a brunch or Bristol if

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:27.510 
may absorb into a brunch or Bristol if
it<00:04:25.870> was<00:04:25.990> placed<00:04:26.229> inside<00:04:26.440> the<00:04:26.590> bottle<00:04:27.009> like<00:04:27.460> I

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520 
it was placed inside the bottle like I

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:28.770 
it was placed inside the bottle like I
said<00:04:27.580> I<00:04:27.669> don't<00:04:27.759> know<00:04:27.880> what<00:04:28.240> I'm<00:04:28.330> saying<00:04:28.539> it

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:28.780 
said I don't know what I'm saying it

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:30.540 
said I don't know what I'm saying it
just<00:04:28.960> sounds<00:04:29.259> right<00:04:29.440> I<00:04:29.770> think<00:04:30.310> they<00:04:30.400> could

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:30.550 
just sounds right I think they could

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:31.950 
just sounds right I think they could
have<00:04:30.639> went<00:04:30.789> ahead<00:04:30.880> and<00:04:31.120> used<00:04:31.180> like<00:04:31.419> a<00:04:31.449> dispense

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:31.960 
have went ahead and used like a dispense

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:33.360 
have went ahead and used like a dispense
thing<00:04:32.229> like<00:04:32.410> this<00:04:32.650> where<00:04:32.889> you<00:04:32.919> just<00:04:33.099> press<00:04:33.340> it

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:33.370 
thing like this where you just press it

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:35.490 
thing like this where you just press it
out<00:04:33.610> that<00:04:34.210> would<00:04:34.419> work<00:04:34.599> well<00:04:34.810> but<00:04:35.050> since<00:04:35.259> it<00:04:35.380> is

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:35.500 
out that would work well but since it is

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:37.469 
out that would work well but since it is
so<00:04:35.710> liquidy<00:04:36.220> maybe<00:04:36.520> this<00:04:36.729> was<00:04:36.880> the<00:04:37.030> best<00:04:37.180> bit

00:04:37.469 --> 00:04:37.479 
so liquidy maybe this was the best bit

00:04:37.479 --> 00:04:39.719 
so liquidy maybe this was the best bit
because<00:04:37.630> the<00:04:38.349> foundation<00:04:38.889> really<00:04:39.160> latches<00:04:39.550> on

00:04:39.719 --> 00:04:39.729 
because the foundation really latches on

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:42.300 
because the foundation really latches on
to<00:04:39.970> this<00:04:40.210> on<00:04:40.660> little<00:04:41.530> thing<00:04:41.740> in<00:04:41.860> here<00:04:42.070> I<00:04:42.160> just

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:42.310 
to this on little thing in here I just

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:44.070 
to this on little thing in here I just
think<00:04:42.460> it's<00:04:42.580> weird<00:04:42.699> maybe<00:04:43.509> it's<00:04:43.660> just<00:04:43.690> me<00:04:43.900> you

00:04:44.070 --> 00:04:44.080 
think it's weird maybe it's just me you

00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:45.270 
think it's weird maybe it's just me you
know<00:04:44.110> i'm<00:04:44.289> basically<00:04:44.470> i<00:04:44.620> don't<00:04:44.800> know<00:04:44.889> but<00:04:45.190> i

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.280 
know i'm basically i don't know but i

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:46.560 
know i'm basically i don't know but i
just<00:04:45.460> think<00:04:45.520> it's<00:04:45.699> kind<00:04:45.849> of<00:04:45.880> odd<00:04:46.090> to<00:04:46.270> have<00:04:46.389> that

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:46.570 
just think it's kind of odd to have that

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:48.029 
just think it's kind of odd to have that
little<00:04:46.750> thing<00:04:46.960> in<00:04:47.110> there<00:04:47.259> and<00:04:47.410> not<00:04:47.500> a<00:04:47.530> brush<00:04:47.770> or

00:04:48.029 --> 00:04:48.039 
little thing in there and not a brush or

00:04:48.039 --> 00:04:49.439 
little thing in there and not a brush or
something<00:04:48.400> and<00:04:48.550> get<00:04:48.759> to<00:04:48.940> order<00:04:49.210> throughout

00:04:49.439 --> 00:04:49.449 
something and get to order throughout

00:04:49.449 --> 00:04:52.710 
something and get to order throughout
the<00:04:49.660> day<00:04:49.840> when<00:04:50.740> I<00:04:50.770> did<00:04:51.039> wear<00:04:51.370> it<00:04:51.610> if<00:04:52.180> the<00:04:52.509> color

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:52.720 
the day when I did wear it if the color

00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.420 
the day when I did wear it if the color
was<00:04:52.930> really<00:04:53.229> i<00:04:53.380> mean<00:04:53.410> the<00:04:53.680> color<00:04:53.889> was<00:04:54.070> really

00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:54.430 
was really i mean the color was really

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:56.460 
was really i mean the color was really
real<00:04:54.639> like<00:04:54.910> I<00:04:55.060> found<00:04:55.449> myself<00:04:55.630> reaching<00:04:56.110> for
