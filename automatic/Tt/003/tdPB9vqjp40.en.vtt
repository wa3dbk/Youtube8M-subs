00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:14.810
 another review on the light my fire 

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:17.750
 on 

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:21.260
 ranger I have 

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:24.410
 in the execution office fetched for 12,000 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:27.950
 you want to ignite then immediately 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:31.400
 so it's in the long run 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:35.210
 the 9 cm are pretty much one here 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:37.940
 These little sheep are almost five 

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.230
 centimeter of the student in the lab is in it 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:44.390
 Maybe it's just that 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:48.010
 version 2.0 and how do I find myself 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:49.820
 already five times six uses the chance 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:51.130
 and have already first 

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.969
 made modifications 

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:55.430
 even if I only have him for a few hours 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:57.980
 I have the same layout here 

00:00:55.430 --> 00:01:00.350
 same knee castle park out 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:03.829
 made because before was here so one 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.940
 normal nylon cord material and that 

00:01:03.829 --> 00:01:05.570
 I did not like that much now that I did 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.090
 opened 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:11.450
 It is easy to get on and then I have it easy 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.470
 made paravan yes there is actually 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.930
 not much to tell 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:21.680
 besides , here I am still taking as 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:27.200
 compare mainz rpo so the the 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:30.409
 Frictional surface of the iron part is the same 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:34.090
 long as that to book again 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:40.659
 I have a good comparison now 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:43.369
 what brings a bit further sets 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:47.360
 my camera is a bit sluggish when i am 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:50.979
 hello 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:53.090
 this is how it works here 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:56.110
 and then I should actually 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.110
 Get full quickly 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:10.130
 but it's already burning and it's coming 

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:14.150
 no second time in the first time I still 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:19.730
 not quite right I sit down 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:21.320
 the camera attack but what makes beautiful 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:29.660
 heat is thus also a fire at 

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:31.600
 getting cool is part of the celebration 

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:33.650
 style 

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.800
 just because it's really easy 

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:39.700
 makes beautiful points 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:43.280
 and from the price really pleasant 15 new 

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:48.530
 have now paid for it at Amazon and 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:51.440
 that for 12,000 ignition indicated 

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:53.600
 are now I have about 10 pieces already 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:57.709
 it is easy for something to go off 

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:59.570
 but let's see how they are in this 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:04.180
 car area beats better with weather 

00:02:59.570 --> 00:03:04.180
 will try which one very times 

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:17.720
 yes a little video review to light my 

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:20.350
