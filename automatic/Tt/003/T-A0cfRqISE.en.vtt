00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
this game without a silencer it's

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.350 
this game without a silencer it's
impossible<00:02:14.280> so<00:02:14.400> if<00:02:14.520> you<00:02:14.640> can't<00:02:14.910> play<00:02:15.120> without

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
impossible so if you can't play without

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.190 
impossible so if you can't play without
a<00:02:15.420> silencer<00:02:16.220> that's<00:02:17.220> cool<00:02:17.610> you<00:02:18.420> stock<00:02:18.840> for

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:19.200 
a silencer that's cool you stock for

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.060 
a silencer that's cool you stock for
example<00:02:20.060> it<00:02:21.060> will<00:02:21.210> be<00:02:21.360> very<00:02:21.540> helpful<00:02:22.070> I'm

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
example it will be very helpful I'm

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:25.340 
example it will be very helpful I'm
using<00:02:23.340> grip<00:02:23.760> because<00:02:24.150> toward<00:02:24.780> the<00:02:24.960> Thor

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350 
using grip because toward the Thor

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.500 
using grip because toward the Thor
doesn't<00:02:25.710> miss<00:02:25.890> he<00:02:26.280> has<00:02:26.430> great<00:02:26.760> accuracy<00:02:27.120> there

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:27.510 
doesn't miss he has great accuracy there

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:29.420 
doesn't miss he has great accuracy there
that's<00:02:27.750> why<00:02:27.930> I'm<00:02:28.050> using<00:02:28.200> grip<00:02:28.590> so<00:02:28.710> that<00:02:28.890> I<00:02:29.070> can

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
that's why I'm using grip so that I can

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:33.740 
that's why I'm using grip so that I can
have<00:02:29.640> a<00:02:29.850> beast<00:02:30.690> accuracy<00:02:31.730> as<00:02:32.750> equipment

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
have a beast accuracy as equipment

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:36.410 
have a beast accuracy as equipment
equipment<00:02:34.230> I'm<00:02:34.680> using<00:02:34.890> the<00:02:35.240> trophy<00:02:36.240> system

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
equipment I'm using the trophy system

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.980 
equipment I'm using the trophy system
because<00:02:36.870> Thor<00:02:37.260> can<00:02:37.650> create<00:02:38.130> a<00:02:38.750> shield<00:02:39.750> around

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:39.990 
because Thor can create a shield around

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:43.130 
because Thor can create a shield around
him<00:02:40.470> that<00:02:41.120> protects<00:02:42.120> him<00:02:42.300> from<00:02:42.330> you<00:02:43.020> know

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.220 
that
I'm<00:02:47.160> using<00:02:47.430> two<00:02:47.910> shock<00:02:48.270> dildos<00:02:48.810> because<00:02:49.200> a

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
I'm using two shock dildos because a

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:51.320 
I'm using two shock dildos because a
four<00:02:49.950> is<00:02:50.070> the<00:02:50.220> god<00:02:50.370> of<00:02:50.400> thunder<00:02:50.760> there<00:02:51.150> and

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:54.720 
therefore he can I use he uses lightning

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:58.130 
therefore he can I use he uses lightning

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:00.000 
that whatever that's why I'm using the

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.180 
that whatever that's why I'm using the
little<00:03:00.810> shock<00:03:01.350> dildos<00:03:01.770> because<00:03:02.070> the

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:09.510 
you can also get kills with a shock you

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.600 
you can also get kills with a shock you
know<00:03:09.690> if<00:03:09.840> the<00:03:10.140> the<00:03:10.170> enemy<00:03:10.770> is<00:03:10.830> damaged<00:03:11.280> enough

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:11.610

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
so it's perfect it is look at that that

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.840 
so it's perfect it is look at that that
is<00:03:14.070> absolutely<00:03:15.650> garbage<00:03:16.650> garbage<00:03:17.370> right

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:17.850 
is absolutely garbage garbage right

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:21.140 
is absolutely garbage garbage right
there<00:03:18.120> this<00:03:18.690> is<00:03:18.750> so<00:03:19.170> fucked<00:03:19.500> up<00:03:19.709> and<00:03:20.340> what<00:03:21.000> else

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150

flak<00:03:24.840> jacket<00:03:25.350> because<00:03:25.500> I<00:03:26.430> mean<00:03:26.670> Thor<00:03:27.180> has<00:03:27.420> a

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
flak jacket because I mean Thor has a

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:30.650 
flak jacket because I mean Thor has a
nice<00:03:28.410> armor<00:03:28.980> and<00:03:29.160> the<00:03:29.700> armor<00:03:30.060> gives<00:03:30.300> him<00:03:30.540> a

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660 
nice armor and the armor gives him a

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:32.570 
nice armor and the armor gives him a
protection<00:03:31.290> gives<00:03:31.500> him<00:03:31.650> protection<00:03:32.070> against

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:32.580 
protection gives him protection against

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:35.090 
protection gives him protection against
you<00:03:33.060> know<00:03:33.380> incoming<00:03:34.380> attacks<00:03:34.739> whatever

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
you know incoming attacks whatever

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.400 
you know incoming attacks whatever
something<00:03:35.459> like<00:03:35.670> that<00:03:35.880> and<00:03:36.180> you<00:03:36.870> as<00:03:37.050> you<00:03:37.080> can

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
something like that and you as you can

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:41.540 
something like that and you as you can
see<00:03:38.180> the<00:03:39.180> oflag<00:03:39.540> jacket<00:03:39.989> emblem<00:03:40.500> is<00:03:40.739> a<00:03:40.980> shield

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:41.550 
see the oflag jacket emblem is a shield

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:43.910 
see the oflag jacket emblem is a shield
so<00:03:42.300> that<00:03:42.630> makes<00:03:42.840> perfect<00:03:43.080> sense<00:03:43.350> to<00:03:43.739> use<00:03:43.890> a

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920 
so that makes perfect sense to use a

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:49.040 
so that makes perfect sense to use a
flak<00:03:44.340> jacket<00:03:44.370> I'm<00:03:45.000> using<00:03:45.300> as<00:03:47.810> Middle<00:03:48.810> Park

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:52.220 
flak jacket I'm using as Middle Park
toughness<00:03:49.739> because<00:03:50.340> look<00:03:50.670> at<00:03:50.760> that<00:03:51.230> toughness

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
toughness because look at that toughness

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:55.670 
toughness because look at that toughness
has<00:03:52.650> a<00:03:53.420> bicep<00:03:54.420> like<00:03:54.570> a<00:03:54.660> big<00:03:54.870> arm<00:03:55.170> right<00:03:55.380> there
