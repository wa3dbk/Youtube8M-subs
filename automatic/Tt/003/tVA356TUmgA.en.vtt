00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.400
 previously we will explain 

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.950
 how will you install part of the sea that touches another store 

00:00:11.559 --> 00:00:13.519
 Of applications 

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:16.519
 per hundred for it what we have to go is to marquez 

00:00:18.909 --> 00:00:21.909
 inside the sea who took his to look 

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:27.399
 and in search we write 

00:00:27.399 --> 00:00:30.289
 ape kato 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:33.150
 I do not have to go all 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:35.640
 the application appears 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.120
 we were 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.350
 p - or from a comment that makes the app comments from people 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.080
 percent in April touched my life wait 

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:48.990
 climbing 

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:51.430
 once installed 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:54.490
 we run at retail mexico took the application 

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:00.180
 and will ask us the first time if we want to update 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.530
 we authorize 

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:05.530
 We stayed in Osuna from a repository and 

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.520
 in itself pre-installed 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.520
 and the most important thing is, do not go to the menu 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.350
 repositories 

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:17.030
 and as beautiful that I already have a list 

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.370
 collaborated repositories under puts the amount of applications that each 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:22.300
 repository 

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:25.860
 per hundred to add more repositories we go to the menu 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:31.580
 by repository sludge 

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:34.380
 we would put the address of the repository 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:36.650
 and add 

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:40.020
 a backward exit never back wrapping to the main menu 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:46.040
 percent would offer us a poster saying that you have to update the 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.070
 soto list did analysts 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:51.520
 and it puts all the applications that there are 

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:55.780
 in those moments in this case right now there are one thousand two hundred and thirty 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.540
 the only drawback that this application has 

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:04.950
 is that to ea not be from android the market store 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.300
 I have requested 

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:10.999
 the removal of security permits 

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:13.559
 to be able to install applications 

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:16.769
 with it leads to that if you do not know what application these were you can 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:18.629
 distract yourself or a virus 

00:02:18.629 --> 00:02:21.399
 A program 

00:02:21.399 --> 00:02:23.609
 it gives 

00:02:23.609 --> 00:02:28.040
 let's say send data that does not demand then this is convenient because the 

00:02:28.039 --> 00:02:29.639
 application 

00:02:29.639 --> 00:02:32.359
 was it commented on in a forum or ask 

00:02:32.359 --> 00:02:33.569
 / 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:35.549
 have no problem 

00:02:35.549 --> 00:02:41.079
 what I'm seeing now on the screen uses repositories that you can add to 

00:02:41.079 --> 00:02:42.549
 the view 

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:43.920
 d 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:46.459
 the apec to all 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:48.369
 I hope that with this 

00:02:48.369 --> 00:02:54.269
 you are clear that not only mark ain that many more places where you can download 

00:02:54.269 --> 00:02:57.920
 dn of many more repositories by the time we find all 

00:02:58.919 --> 00:03:03.019
 and I hope that on your mobile to a repo compose leaving repositores in the 

00:03:03.019 --> 00:03:03.749
 forum 

00:03:03.749 --> 00:03:06.349
