 One more video this time is the second 

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.449
 battle that happened for the championship 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:25.529
 defeated yesterday between the tube that 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.449

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:34.649
 o iv what happened is your brother 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.090
 was playing with the bacteria and today it is 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.329
 that the pedro you know was 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:41.250
 playing with egypt as you see here 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.780
 I counted his agility only when 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:44.129
 I remember now that the unit is now 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.480
 with the handling of battles already 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:49.980
 started I will not be able to speak but my 

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:52.890
 I reiterate that they were already inside. 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.870
 rules and it happened for what I am 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.910
 watching here is the video passed the video on 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.989
 his channel including I advise you to 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.010
 if scolding and also because it was he who 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.020
 fought the battle 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.390
 He will succeed with you, will see the 

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.430
 hate explanation of how it was but already 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.810
 begins to move here already pedro 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.920
 had begun to move a little 

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:12.990
 more also 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:15.090
 and for the time being the two made a 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:16.650
 approach they already went to action soon 

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:21.210
 at the beginning of the battle did not last 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:23.220
 much has already been short until the two have used 

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.049
 2010 elephants and they moved the 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.330
 elephants from opposite sides like you 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.700
 You can see here is the movement here and 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.689
 moved to each in one of the 

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:34.799
 battle flanks 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:38.460
 Then a report was sent here. 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.930
 unit christina uncles against 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:41.790
 elephants of the dodo 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.009
 I always make a mistake, I'll start 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:45.720
 shoot at the same time at the same time 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:47.520
 google elephants the time is 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.500
 shoot at christian atsu unit 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:53.070
 here since they demoralize few 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:54.869
 elephant but it was not enough for 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.000
 to make it run on itself does not exist 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:59.180
 a replay but I did not and the video but I 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.610
 I will not remember the details 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:05.040
 Anyway, the guy said he sent this 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.659
 this attack to upgrade while he 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.840
 kept commanding his crimes 

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:11.280
 some attacks was a good means 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.250
 studied in the beginning for what I am seeing 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.770
 no one here is taking two 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:19.590
 the asset but at the same time thinking about where 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:21.450
 would attack that in places 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.750
 finally the human baby to the cavalry to 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:27.480
 up the dragon and retreat olÃ© 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:32.000
 I also the fan of the law chivalry 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:35.550
 that it was up to the house is 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:38.700
 He sends ooo the Peruvian elephants. 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:40.170
 here behind those of the cavalry of the dodo and 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.240
 sends some of that law also he 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.280
 back and at the same time he goes here with 

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:46.440
 infantry and he ends up reaching 

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.900
 if I'm not mistaken, the enemy's home 

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.010
 that on this side is at least the battle 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.350
 It will get a little concentrated here. 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:56.190
 in this corner the battle has not started 

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:58.260
 Still as you can see it's aaa a 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:00.720
 pedro cavalry continues to continue 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:01.260
 following the horseman say that he stopped for 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.930
 on here 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:06.480
 only he came back, who stepped back while 

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:09.360
 Here's what I said to someone is caught 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:11.040
 the infantry fighting was tiles and 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:15.450
 The battle was concentrated more or less 

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:18.000
 here in this corner here on the sidewalk 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:20.880
 right here the bread but the work was 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:24.660
 concentrated here on this right flank 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:26.580
 the elephants began to take a 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:28.170
 little damage from his cavalry 

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:29.400
 together with the crimes that were 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:32.190
 shooting at them like you 

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:35.760
 here and here on the 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:37.350
 Battle was well here but is troubled 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.420
 nobody takes advantage because he had 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:45.000
 some rays of some GuardeAqui 

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:48.269
 cavalry of pedro and we will see here here 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.090
 that side collision happened also aas 

00:03:48.269 --> 00:03:56.250
 elephants of the dude beating here in the net 

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:58.380
 and remember that for him it seems 

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:00.959
 that is to be able to overcome this and if 

00:03:58.380 --> 00:04:03.480
 this up in the video he says that 

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:05.040
 he was very lucky because it's them 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.329
 turned the phalanx well into attack time 

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.769
 the good before releasing talking here 

00:04:06.329 --> 00:04:10.019
 so it was very lucky that I did not lose 

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:12.269
 elephant of liquidity corner while here 

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:14.040
 he was still dominating the fight is a 

00:04:12.269 --> 00:04:18.090
 fight that was finally happening 

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:20.160
 here by the superiority of 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:22.349
 infantry in 50 days the platoon 

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:23.490
 arriving here but here they arrived 

00:04:22.349 --> 00:04:24.990
 too late because it gave time to 

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:27.190
 eliminate that part of the army here 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:29.950
 before he could arrive 

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:31.690
 if you have already organized it is still found here 

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:35.080
 of a chardy behind here in this 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:39.520
 his infantry who gave tremendous damage 

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:41.050
 and how can you see here is the time 

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:44.560
 that he arrived here to fight 

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:46.930
 against him it was already very late and it was already 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:48.340
 It's very difficult to do anything to 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:49.900
 to recover from the battle because 

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:51.340
 lost range phones had both 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:55.240
 elephants allowed by the rules and 

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:56.590
 impacts is and still had a few more 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:57.520
 serve but some other 

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:59.950
 units 

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:02.380
 so he won in that corner he 

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:07.780
 won he was able to win the battle and 

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:09.910
 my game again and came back and as I said 

00:05:07.780 --> 00:05:11.530
 By then it was late and I already 

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:13.510
 then go forward little missing to end 

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:16.270
 with which your one wins this battle 

00:05:13.510 --> 00:05:18.490
 so he wins three points in the group 

00:05:16.270 --> 00:05:21.550
 he is my group by the way he 

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:25.360
 is the leader of the group f became leader of the 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:29.950
 group after the battle to where you 

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:32.260
 have knowledge and that's it 

00:05:29.950 --> 00:05:34.450
 the battle was won by him as you 

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:36.370
 can see here 

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:38.080
 then he had to eliminate the rest 

00:05:36.370 --> 00:05:43.419
 of the event units were here 

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:46.480
 and they won and won three points there. 

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:50.430
 and we still have some matches 

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:52.900
 to vote I have two at least 

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:57.130
 the dude also has two more and finally 

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:59.500
 another battle happened than was the 

00:05:57.130 --> 00:06:01.450
 battle of the air corners with your life that I 

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:03.640
 If everything works out, I'll post tomorrow. 

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:05.470
 but at last you can see the victory 

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:08.080
 It was costly but it was a very 

00:06:05.470 --> 00:06:10.930
 good the victory was won more was 

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:12.760
 one a victory and a good victory of the 

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:13.660
 dragon started the championship very well and 

00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:15.730
 this championship 

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:17.440
 the same way the last one started as 

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:21.460
 you can see that he had 904 

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:25.570
 soldiers lost the diego lost 595 and 

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:28.510
 killed 185 and Pedro had 896 soldiers 

00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:33.250
 he killed 687 he's an excuse he 

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:35.050
 lost 686 and killed 500 281 and must be 

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:36.820
 I have tried to narrate this battle that 

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:38.440
 happened between the two 

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:40.180
