00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:36.689 
just about every morning now because I

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:40.190 
just about every morning now because I

have an oily t-zone this hasn't dried me
out<00:01:40.409> but<00:01:41.219> if<00:01:41.399> you<00:01:41.429> do<00:01:41.759> have<00:01:42.060> a<00:01:42.090> normal<00:01:42.659> skin<00:01:42.979> you

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:43.979 
out but if you do have a normal skin you

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:45.620 
out but if you do have a normal skin you
may<00:01:44.249> not<00:01:44.429> want<00:01:44.670> to<00:01:44.729> use<00:01:44.999> this<00:01:45.149> every<00:01:45.420> single

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:45.630 
may not want to use this every single

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.749 
may not want to use this every single
day<00:01:45.929> because<00:01:46.139> it'll<00:01:46.590> probably<00:01:47.189> dry<00:01:47.520> your<00:01:47.729> skin

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
day because it'll probably dry your skin

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.949 
day because it'll probably dry your skin
out<00:01:48.270> it<00:01:48.630> is<00:01:49.170> a<00:01:49.590> bit<00:01:49.950> harsh<00:01:50.520> but<00:01:50.909> like<00:01:51.569> I<00:01:51.689> said<00:01:51.929> I

00:01:51.949 --> 00:01:51.959 
out it is a bit harsh but like I said I

00:01:51.959 --> 00:01:54.139 
out it is a bit harsh but like I said I
haven't<00:01:52.350> really<00:01:52.590> t-zone<00:01:53.100> and<00:01:53.490> I<00:01:53.729> think<00:01:54.030> it

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
haven't really t-zone and I think it

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:56.480 
haven't really t-zone and I think it
works<00:01:54.359> really<00:01:54.630> great<00:01:54.990> to<00:01:55.229> suck<00:01:55.560> out<00:01:55.799> all<00:01:56.069> of

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.170 
shine free all day long it does take the
oil<00:02:09.539> out<00:02:09.780> of<00:02:10.080> my<00:02:10.259> face<00:02:10.590> in<00:02:11.280> the<00:02:11.489> morning<00:02:11.849> times

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:12.180 
oil out of my face in the morning times

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.390 
oil out of my face in the morning times
but<00:02:12.510> by<00:02:12.750> midday<00:02:13.049> the<00:02:13.439> oil<00:02:13.650> comes

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.400 
but by midday the oil comes

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.089 
but by midday the oil comes
and<00:02:14.730> it<00:02:14.849> just<00:02:15.030> says<00:02:15.330> on<00:02:15.569> my<00:02:15.720> face<00:02:15.989> until<00:02:16.709> I<00:02:16.739> wash

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:17.099 
and it just says on my face until I wash

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:19.550 
and it just says on my face until I wash
my<00:02:17.340> face<00:02:17.370> again<00:02:18.030> so<00:02:18.599> unfortunately<00:02:19.260> it

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
my face again so unfortunately it

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.280 
my face again so unfortunately it
doesn't<00:02:19.769> live<00:02:20.099> up<00:02:20.340> to<00:02:20.370> that<00:02:20.610> expectation<00:02:21.299> so

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
doesn't live up to that expectation so

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.800 
doesn't live up to that expectation so
it<00:02:22.560> keeps<00:02:22.799> me<00:02:23.129> shine<00:02:23.459> free<00:02:23.760> for<00:02:24.180> the<00:02:24.780> first

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:24.810 
it keeps me shine free for the first

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.440 
it keeps me shine free for the first
half<00:02:25.409> of<00:02:25.530> the<00:02:25.709> day<00:02:25.920> and<00:02:26.220> my<00:02:26.400> teeth<00:02:26.909> on<00:02:27.150> maybe

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
half of the day and my teeth on maybe

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:31.039 
half of the day and my teeth on maybe
oiler<00:02:28.319> than<00:02:28.680> some<00:02:28.980> other<00:02:29.220> people<00:02:29.849> so<00:02:30.840> I<00:02:30.870> think

00:02:31.039 --> 00:02:31.049 
oiler than some other people so I think

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:34.039 
oiler than some other people so I think
the<00:02:31.349> results<00:02:31.890> may<00:02:32.099> vary<00:02:32.129> for<00:02:33.060> each<00:02:33.269> individual

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:34.049 
the results may vary for each individual

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:36.710 
the results may vary for each individual
person<00:02:34.670> overall<00:02:35.670> I<00:02:35.700> really<00:02:36.239> do<00:02:36.360> like<00:02:36.540> this

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:36.720

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:41.190 
like the fact that it removes some of

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:43.580 
like the fact that it removes some of
the<00:02:41.459> oil<00:02:41.700> from<00:02:41.849> my<00:02:42.060> face<00:02:42.360> I<00:02:42.720> haven't<00:02:43.200> really
