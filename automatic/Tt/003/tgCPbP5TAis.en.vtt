00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:08.550
 a match proceeding live 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:10.889
 seemed to be channeled in the right way then 

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.900
 what happened success happened 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:16.080
 that despite our demerits 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:18.840
 now we are tired I want to send a 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.150
 message really to all the fans that 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.130
 they still haven't understood it this year 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:24.300
 I'm not shut up, I told everyone 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.630
 Parma fans 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:29.490
 if they don't realize what 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.710
 is happening to the parma from the beginning 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:35.100
 of the year is not only needed today 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:38.010
 that you understand this why 

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.050
 probably parma does not have is not not 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:43.320
 protected from a logic point of view 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.950
 of respect for history for what 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.230
 is 

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:48.000
 28 admonished since the beginning of the year 5 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.920
 penalty kicks against seven today 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.820
 cautioned against 0 and 2 penalty kicks 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.860
 versus 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.780
 we ended up not playing for two games 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:56.610
 finished we did two times of two 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.230
 matches in 10 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.359
 if it is not lack of respect this 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:02.699
 then I say I start from an assumption 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:05.369
 that I take the example of Verona and Verona 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:08.250
 has had three on how many home games 

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:10.680
 has had three newcomers this time 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.970
 lack and respect this is the lack 

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.130
 of respect 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.580
 then now I am no longer silent 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:19.110
 because if they really want to not miss 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:21.240
 compliance in the sense that occur for 

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.979
 make us something evil more beautiful 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.200
 simple the fiscal against the parma that 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:27.600
 understand against verona because verona there 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.299
 excites a team that does what it does 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.520
 news and therefore is fine in this way 

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:34.380
 okay this way i say that i 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.810
 then I don't shut up after the others in Parma 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:38.939
 tell me that I believe alibi ai 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.520
 players did not create libya anyone I say 

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:43.000
 that this dress is a shame 

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.400
 debutants what it means 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.170
 and practically easier to give a 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:50.050
 admonition to the parma yes that from verona 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:53.590
 because because there is public 

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:55.120
 this is reality I don't talk about kicks 

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.750
 I do not speak of what I am 

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:58.000
 speaking 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.160
 I'm talking about seven warnings against 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.380
 zero and I'm talking that the parma has 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:04.690
 got 28 yellow cards from the beginning of the year 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:05.770
 and took two reds from the end of everything 

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:08.709
 the second half 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:10.660
 I talk about this there is a situation in 

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:12.190
 to be a player with everything today 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.170
 the respect to the esteem that is arbitrated there 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:17.320
 match of Verona 

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:19.090
 if the referee and he would be tones went to 

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:21.400
 review the images of what it says 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.900
 to the referee when one is not given 

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:25.060
 punishment go and see what it is 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:27.040
 success with amauri without gesturing 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.890
 in the match against the atanta 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.570
 this is the non-uniformity the rigor the 

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.790
 punishment then already I do not care 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:35.230
 obviously the episodes of which you 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:38.140
 speaks and therefore it seems that the referee 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:40.989
 marino rita I talk about rivalry of 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:43.120
 judgment in reference to what it is 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:43.870
 a logic of what is done in 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:45.160
 field 

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:47.980
 Mr. gesticulate and send to that country 

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:50.170
 the referee must be thrown out like 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.209
 it happened for amauri if i talk about 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.100
 this I speak this way if on Sunday 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:55.690
 last to shut up that you first at 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:57.519
 advantage and then later back again 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:58.239
 and it is said that penalty kick with 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:02.350
 expulsion 

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:04.299
 ok then if the benefit is over now 

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:06.640
 They would explain all these things are 

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:11.769
 apples explain if I'm wrong i 

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:13.630
 regulations and I'm in place we need to be there 

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:15.579
 under which no no is not a question 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:19.120
 sick he pulls me into speeches have 

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:20.620
 I think I'm saying that I know I am there 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.690
 controversy at the show leo because I bring 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:25.360
 compared to the Parma fans of Parma 

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:27.100
 ok it 's work for parma means 

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.690
 that 28 cautioned and at the beginning of the year 

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:31.510
 two expelled 5 penalties against do 

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:33.660
 think about what he knows what a situation has 

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:37.910
 that whistles against you is easy 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:41.180
 this is the reality is very easy 

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:43.310
 hear of players 301 what they said 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:45.650
 the players I say all the matches of 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:47.660
 help the referee not to protest 

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:50.330
 doing something every minimum foul is 

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:52.190
 the admonition and that I have to tell him I don't know 

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:57.370
 more credible those players don't know anymore 

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:59.330
 absolutely credible he spoke loudly 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:01.340
 could change something 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:03.950
 no it changes nothing says only that 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:05.990
 they speak shut up as each time 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:07.910
 I speak that I say half what I said 

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:10.090
 at the beginning be careful because the bad trend 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:13.490
 i don't like ok 

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:15.230
 I am also criticized by Parma at the rhymes 

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:17.420
 and messages to Parma no to those who want me 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:19.250
 questions to take me inside one 

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:20.989
 situation that does not interest me 

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:22.310
 he is very interested in Verona 

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:25.100
 of that Verona won the game 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:27.260
 congratulations to Verona ok unless I 

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:30.710
 happen to have seven warnings in favor 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:32.120
 0 2 penalty kicks healthy mom 

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:37.220
 unfortunate to believe that I have to say 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:40.400
 unfortunate that there is too much silence 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:42.290
 no small big there is an ease of 

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:44.360
 warn the players of Parma a 

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:47.060
 detriment of others because so much every 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:50.930
 once you talk, it doesn't matter 

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:52.850
 this is reality, this is reality 

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:54.560
 tomorrow I expect it 's the fault of the 

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:56.060
 players also parma newspapers 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:59.690
 tomorrow and the players body 

00:04:56.060 --> 00:05:02.270
 I go but it is also the fault of the players but 

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:03.800
 good god we want to give a signal 

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:05.120
 the regulation says the other week 

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:07.610
 I was silent 

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:10.730
 the regulation says that if you grant a 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:13.340
 I lead the action it ends there are 

00:05:10.730 --> 00:05:15.230
 to deny this level from anyone 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:17.419
 journalist said this and us 

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:19.940
 we finished a match in ten good 

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:21.050
 we won it and it is good for everyone because 

00:05:19.940 --> 00:05:23.450
 because we won because we have 

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:25.460
 proved to be even stronger than 

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:27.710
 this wrong has happened to udine 

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:28.490
 this is the success of the atanta speaks of 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:30.950
 similar cases 

00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:33.050
 what he said amauri amauri has 

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:34.520
 rightly paid the poor consequences 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:36.320
 everyone expresses himself in regard to the 

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:40.360
 others with gestures and situations 

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:40.360
 not even admonitions and therefore I am tired
