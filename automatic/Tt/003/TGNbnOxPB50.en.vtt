00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:14.799
 good and cold afternoon friends today or 

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:17.290
 try a tutorial on how to paint bag 

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:19.000
 replicate in this case I have used the 

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:21.610
 Montana brand for me is in the replica 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.779
 there are many kilo brands a focus but I 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:24.490
 I'm going to go until a little more 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:26.380
 economic and we give less the same 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:28.270
 results that a high-end painting 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:30.520
 not exactly the same do not eat me 

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:34.090
 not the same but similar 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:37.210
 I have used two varieties of montana in 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:39.520
 montana 94 and the mountain market 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:42.760
 hardcore 2 

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.930
 the mount the 94 are a low spray 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.840
 pressure that suits us very well for 

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:48.700
 our task this is not low pressure 

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:51.070
 exactly but taking the 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:51.940
 adequate precautions not now the same 

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:56.550
 function 

00:00:51.940 --> 00:01:00.970
 I used the color plus the druids 

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:03.610
 and brown Inca if you go to some at home 

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:05.680
 this color now yes and also the brown 

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:09.040
 kraft I do not know very well what though as 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:10.570
 but good in English, not very good, I go 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.430
 to use the network technique that this 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:14.770
 consists of giving a base layer and then 

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:17.470
 when it is partially dry on average 

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:19.479
 hour to an hour we put the rule over 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:21.000
 and we paint to create a plot of 

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:22.740
 squares 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.750
 to avoid applying what you have to 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.540
 to do is first clean it with a cloth 

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:30.240
 wet and then wipe dry 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.460
 remove the moisture does not use and never a 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:35.670
 paper because you will leave scraps of paper with 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:37.850
 cellulose and then those remains will make 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:40.490
 that the paint does not stick well 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:42.500
 for our lives many techniques like 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:44.689
 I said that they use the network you can also 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:46.729
 use paper templates to give a 

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:48.860
 kurland effect or a digital effect or 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:50.420
 you can buy the templates made are 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.700
 a little expensive but good they do their 

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.759
 You can also use the technique 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.710
 of the sponge that consists of getting wet 

00:01:54.759 --> 00:02:00.140
 pieces of sponge to put on top of 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:02.330
 the replica and thus give it a strange effect 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:04.460
 or you can also to how easy it is to catch 

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:07.729
 the replicas and passes directly the 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:09.830
 be above to create the stripes not 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:11.420
 makes the simplest the best for 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.099
 paint a replica 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.630
 Painting tips apply too 

00:02:13.099 --> 00:02:17.940
 when you are with the spray 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.710
 far enough away the replica either 

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.480
 very fast passes very fast for 

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:23.640
 avoid creating the clutter of 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:25.920
 paint the replica that is removed 

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.930
 quite aesthetic and we have it painted 

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.950
 well it is also good not to give many 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.110
 layers of paint to the replica 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:35.550
 and then the effects that I wanted from 

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:41.850
 us but the key says 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:45.200
 very fast we went to 30 40 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:47.000
 centimeters we assimilate thermal 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.280
 perfect 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.810
 about the brand when I tell you that every 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.740
 you already choose more than you want I 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.960
 I say montana because it's cheaper 

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:55.790
 but in the end I bought three boats 

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:58.970
 of montana and they have cost me like a boat 

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:02.300
 painting of spotlights or lime but 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:04.190
 no longer you want me he is direct 

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:05.930
 also because I can experiment with the 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:08.150
 color because there's a lot more variety of 

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:10.010
 color that we sprays and good and 

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:12.260
 Also, if you want to give it a 

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:13.520
 extra protection to your replica 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.470
 you can buy a blood spray 

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:17.690
 idiomatic as I bought myself I do not know 

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:20.239
 I'm going to apply it because I want it to be 

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:22.910
 wear a little with himself was with the 

00:03:20.239 --> 00:03:24.470
 the same effect of time will scratch 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:25.880
 a little bit of paint where to hold on and 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:28.370
 it will be a very good spent effect 

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:31.880
 You know what I could do if you do not want 

00:03:28.370 --> 00:03:34.640
 to choose a sandpaper sandpaper 

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:37.069
 very thin and give it a little 

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:39.470
 before painted in your epics I 

00:03:37.069 --> 00:03:41.150
 I would recommend that you paint over replicas 

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:44.060
 that you have old savings test for 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:46.580
 see the painting how it is in your state 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:48.170
 final so we make sure it is 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:50.720
 place them for you 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:53.060
 he explains he will regret it and that is also 

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:56.060
 good to practice with the bale sprays 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:58.370
 this is what happens if you paint very 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:01.580
 telling you very closely and letting the 

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:04.520
 painting was mounted in the mines and in 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:06.459
 husk and everything is already very cold here 

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:09.230
 you can see what I was doing tests 

00:04:06.459 --> 00:04:11.959
 with a sandpaper to give effect 

00:04:09.230 --> 00:04:13.550
 caught but I did not like it at the end is 

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:15.620
 although it is spent on the replicas here 

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:18.810
 yes it was pretty good but as I have 

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:20.880
 said I will not let it be this alone 

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:23.639
 As I know it's a bit bad to go 

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:25.980
 narrating how I paint my replica of this 

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:27.780
 work of art I will leave with music for 

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:30.740
 enjoy what you have to do 

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.740
 my paint 

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:05.860
 i
