last but not least Sarah's avatar really
cool<00:05:38.250> card<00:05:38.490> I<00:05:38.700> think<00:05:39.360> you<00:05:39.450> guys<00:05:39.630> might<00:05:39.840> agree

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:42.380 
cool card I think you guys might agree
with<00:05:40.230> me<00:05:40.350> I<00:05:40.560> don't<00:05:41.040> know<00:05:41.160> I'm<00:05:41.430> not<00:05:41.490> a<00:05:42.150> mind

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:42.390 
with me I don't know I'm not a mind

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:46.780 
with me I don't know I'm not a mind
reader<00:05:42.650> but<00:05:43.650> it's<00:05:44.370> a<00:05:45.030> really<00:05:45.540> cool<00:05:46.200> card

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:46.790 
reader but it's a really cool card

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:52.570 
reader but it's a really cool card
because<00:05:48.290> Sarah's<00:05:49.290> avatar<00:05:49.890> is<00:05:50.750> power<00:05:51.750> and

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:52.580 
because Sarah's avatar is power and

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:56.180 
because Sarah's avatar is power and
toughness<00:05:53.580> is<00:05:54.060> equal<00:05:54.480> to<00:05:54.690> my<00:05:54.840> life<00:05:55.080> so<00:05:55.470> I<00:05:55.830> think

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:56.190 
toughness is equal to my life so I think

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:59.000 
toughness is equal to my life so I think
a<00:05:56.340> couple<00:05:56.370> times<00:05:56.850> I<00:05:57.090> got<00:05:57.270> up<00:05:57.419> to<00:05:57.690> like<00:05:57.840> 90<00:05:58.740> life

00:05:59.000 --> 00:05:59.010 
a couple times I got up to like 90 life

00:05:59.010 --> 00:06:02.600 
a couple times I got up to like 90 life
I<00:05:59.310> think<00:06:00.169> so<00:06:01.169> this<00:06:01.440> would<00:06:01.620> become<00:06:01.770> a<00:06:01.950> 90<00:06:02.310> 90

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:02.610 
I think so this would become a 90 90

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:05.900 
I think so this would become a 90 90
when<00:06:02.760> I<00:06:02.820> put<00:06:03.030> it<00:06:03.120> in<00:06:03.240> to<00:06:03.630> play<00:06:03.950> which<00:06:04.950> is<00:06:05.130> pretty

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:05.910 
when I put it in to play which is pretty

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:13.750 
when I put it in to play which is pretty
