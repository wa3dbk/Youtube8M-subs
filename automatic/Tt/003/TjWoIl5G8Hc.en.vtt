for<00:02:59.760> my<00:02:59.879> screen<00:03:00.209> stuff<00:03:00.510> so<00:03:00.629> I'm<00:03:00.750> really<00:03:00.900> good

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
for my screen stuff so I'm really good

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:06.470 
for my screen stuff so I'm really good
but<00:03:02.900> with<00:03:03.900> this<00:03:04.109> browser<00:03:05.099> it<00:03:05.489> is<00:03:05.609> just<00:03:05.909> a<00:03:06.090> world

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:06.480 
but with this browser it is just a world

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:09.679 
but with this browser it is just a world
of<00:03:06.689> difference<00:03:07.530> I<00:03:07.799> mean<00:03:08.400> if<00:03:08.519> I<00:03:08.609> go<00:03:08.730> right<00:03:09.090> here

00:03:09.679 --> 00:03:09.689 
of difference I mean if I go right here

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:16.330 
of difference I mean if I go right here
to<00:03:10.470> applications<00:03:11.159> maybe<00:03:11.970> part<00:03:12.329> of<00:03:12.359> the<00:03:12.450> staff

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:22.129 

I<00:03:17.900> can<00:03:18.900> just<00:03:19.049> hit<00:03:19.230> that<00:03:19.290> and<00:03:20.719> it<00:03:21.719> says<00:03:21.870> data

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:22.139 
I can just hit that and it says data

00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:23.659 
I can just hit that and it says data
choices<00:03:22.469> may<00:03:22.590> apply<00:03:22.829> but<00:03:23.040> I<00:03:23.069> haven't<00:03:23.250> limited

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:23.669 
choices may apply but I haven't limited

00:03:23.669 --> 00:03:31.660 
choices may apply but I haven't limited
so<00:03:24.060> yay<00:03:24.989> for<00:03:25.019> me

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:31.670 

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:35.899 

so<00:03:32.670> this<00:03:33.120> is<00:03:33.299> part<00:03:33.569> partly<00:03:34.469> because<00:03:34.650> of<00:03:35.129> the

00:03:35.899 --> 00:03:35.909 
so this is part partly because of the

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:40.879 
so this is part partly because of the
non<00:03:36.060> 3G<00:03:36.569> and<00:03:36.870> that<00:03:37.200> my<00:03:37.349> internet<00:03:39.349> host<00:03:40.349> because

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:40.889

00:03:57.789 --> 00:03:57.799 
just like you would see on a computer

00:03:57.799 --> 00:04:00.589 
just like you would see on a computer
now<00:03:58.799> how<00:03:58.950> does<00:03:59.010> this<00:03:59.219> do<00:03:59.430> it<00:03:59.549> you<00:03:59.609> may<00:03:59.760> ask<00:03:59.879> see

00:04:00.589 --> 00:04:00.599 
now how does this do it you may ask see

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:02.330 
now how does this do it you may ask see
what<00:04:00.749> this<00:04:00.840> does<00:04:01.049> is<00:04:01.200> it<00:04:01.319> compresses<00:04:01.829> every

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:02.340 
what this does is it compresses every

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:07.159 
what this does is it compresses every
website<00:04:02.719> so<00:04:03.719> that<00:04:03.750> way<00:04:04.109> it<00:04:04.799> is<00:04:05.750> smaller<00:04:06.750> so<00:04:07.079> it

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:07.169 
website so that way it is smaller so it

00:04:07.169 --> 00:04:08.659 
website so that way it is smaller so it
cuts<00:04:07.349> down<00:04:07.469> on<00:04:07.530> your<00:04:07.709> data<00:04:07.859> charge<00:04:08.189> as<00:04:08.370> well<00:04:08.489> if

00:04:08.659 --> 00:04:08.669 
cuts down on your data charge as well if

00:04:08.669 --> 00:04:12.500 
cuts down on your data charge as well if
you're<00:04:08.819> not<00:04:08.969> on<00:04:09.769> unlimited<00:04:10.769> and<00:04:11.510> it

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
you're not on unlimited and it

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.899 
you're not on unlimited and it
compresses<00:04:13.260> it<00:04:13.590> and<00:04:13.769> makes<00:04:14.340> it<00:04:14.519> so<00:04:14.760> it's

00:04:14.899 --> 00:04:14.909 
compresses it and makes it so it's

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:20.050 
compresses it and makes it so it's
easier<00:04:15.269> to<00:04:15.650> view<00:04:16.650> and<00:04:17.039> it<00:04:17.430> also<00:04:17.579> can<00:04:17.970> view<00:04:18.470> HTML

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:20.060 
easier to view and it also can view HTML

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:24.100 
easier to view and it also can view HTML
okay<00:04:21.060> so<00:04:21.539> as<00:04:21.840> you<00:04:22.079> can<00:04:22.199> tell<00:04:22.440> it's<00:04:22.710> already

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:24.110 
okay so as you can tell it's already

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:27.140 
okay so as you can tell it's already
