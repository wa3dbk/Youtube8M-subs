00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.250 

right<00:01:51.250> so<00:01:51.520> our<00:01:51.550> first<00:01:52.000> task<00:01:52.360> is<00:01:52.720> to<00:01:52.840> get<00:01:53.230> a

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:53.260 
right so our first task is to get a

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:55.800 
right so our first task is to get a
sound<00:01:54.010> out<00:01:54.190> of<00:01:54.250> all<00:01:54.460> the<00:01:54.580> strings<00:01:54.940> and<00:01:55.210> learn

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
sound out of all the strings and learn

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.050 
sound out of all the strings and learn
how<00:01:55.840> to<00:01:56.110> make<00:01:56.410> some<00:01:56.740> dead<00:01:57.010> notes<00:01:57.340> with<00:01:57.880> our

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
how to make some dead notes with our

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.090 
how to make some dead notes with our
left<00:01:58.270> hand<00:01:58.600> and<00:01:58.810> that's<00:01:59.620> all<00:01:59.830> we're<00:01:59.950> going<00:02:00.040> to

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:00.100 
left hand and that's all we're going to

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:01.890 
left hand and that's all we're going to
do<00:02:00.250> this<00:02:00.460> time<00:02:00.760> so<00:02:01.300> I'm<00:02:01.390> going<00:02:01.420> to<00:02:01.540> put<00:02:01.600> a<00:02:01.720> beat

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:01.900 
do this time so I'm going to put a beat

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:06.420 
do this time so I'm going to put a beat
on<00:02:04.050> you<00:02:05.050> could<00:02:05.230> start<00:02:05.470> even<00:02:05.740> slower<00:02:06.040> than<00:02:06.160> this

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:06.430 
on you could start even slower than this

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:11.450 
on you could start even slower than this
but<00:02:07.090> my<00:02:07.360> suggestion<00:02:07.750> is<00:02:08.050> to<00:02:08.280> start<00:02:09.280> by<00:02:09.429> just

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:11.460 
but my suggestion is to start by just

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:20.880 
but my suggestion is to start by just
getting<00:02:12.460> a<00:02:12.670> sound<00:02:12.970> out<00:02:13.150> of<00:02:13.210> one<00:02:13.480> string<00:02:19.890> once

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
getting a sound out of one string once

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:22.380 
getting a sound out of one string once
you<00:02:21.010> get<00:02:21.160> confident<00:02:21.670> with<00:02:21.730> getting<00:02:22.000> the<00:02:22.120> sound

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
you get confident with getting the sound

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.480 
you get confident with getting the sound
out<00:02:22.570> of<00:02:22.600> the<00:02:22.840> e-string<00:02:23.530> move<00:02:24.070> on<00:02:24.250> to<00:02:24.370> the<00:02:24.459> a

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:24.490 
out of the e-string move on to the a

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:31.440 
out of the e-string move on to the a
string<00:02:29.010> try<00:02:30.010> and<00:02:30.070> look<00:02:30.160> for<00:02:30.280> consistency<00:02:30.700> in

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
string try and look for consistency in

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:43.590 
string try and look for consistency in
your<00:02:31.480> notes<00:02:31.840> and<00:02:33.030> so<00:02:34.030> on<00:02:42.090> so<00:02:43.090> I'm<00:02:43.180> doing<00:02:43.360> that

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:43.600 
your notes and so on so I'm doing that

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.540 
your notes and so on so I'm doing that
across<00:02:43.890> EAD<00:02:44.890> mg<00:02:45.520> all<00:02:46.000> of<00:02:46.209> the<00:02:46.300> open<00:02:46.420> strings

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
across EAD mg all of the open strings

00:02:47.550 --> 00:03:02.520 
across EAD mg all of the open strings
and<00:02:48.550> you<00:02:48.670> can<00:02:48.820> go<00:02:48.970> back<00:02:49.120> down

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:02.530 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:04.720 

after<00:03:03.530> you've<00:03:03.680> done<00:03:03.830> that<00:03:03.890> after<00:03:04.460> you've<00:03:04.580> got

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
after you've done that after you've got

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:12.080 
speed you can start to double it up so

00:04:12.080 --> 00:04:34.600 
speed you can start to double it up so
it<00:04:12.170> sounds<00:04:12.440> like<00:04:12.500> this<00:04:31.840> okay<00:04:33.250> so<00:04:34.250> that's<00:04:34.460> what
