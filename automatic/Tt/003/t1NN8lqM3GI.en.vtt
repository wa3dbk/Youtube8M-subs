00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.120
 Hello, Sir, Modest Tastes from the kitchen 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.720
 we have a beautiful summer meal recipe in this section 

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:18.720
 We will learn "Okra Fries" 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.720
 But if you want to have a look at the necessary materials before 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:25.600
 300 grams of big okra 

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.800
 Frying oil 

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:35.440
 for paste; 4 tomatoes 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.440
 3 tablespoons oil 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.520
 1 pcs cube sugar 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.800
 and 1 teaspoon of salt 

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.560
 As you can see, our list of materials is quite short 

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:56.840
 we have prepared lemon and salt water by the way 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:02.400
 and the heads of our gumbo 

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:13.040
 we keep them in water for at least half an hour 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.360
 Let us continue by preparing our tomatoes while waiting 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:26.560
 We can grate our 4 pieces of tomatoes according to desires 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.560
 this way we break it into small pieces 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.520
 now we can go to cook our tomatoes 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.600
 we put the little sauce pot on fire. 

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:45.040
 now we are leaving 3 scoops of oil 

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:50.760
 after waiting a little to warm up tomatoes 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:02:00.480
 1 candy to get the sourness of the tomato ... 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:05.600
 and 1 teaspoon of salt 

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.400
 and cook until we get a pudding statement 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.680
 Now let's get it back to the backyard 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:19.000
 Let's start to fry our gum 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.280
 put the pan in the fire 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.840
 Add 1, 1, 5 cm high oil 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.760
 In the meantime, we removed our gums from the water 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:42.520
 Our gumni are beautifully creamed, we leave to the pan to fry 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:47.400
 especially if we use big okra, it is worth mentioning 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.920
 In the meantime, our sauce began to cook 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:02.640
 we take our fried okra on a plate 

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:06.920
 In the meantime, our sauce is also closed 

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:16.720
 we fried our okra, I have to warn; a bit too late 

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:21.240
 on the napkin and then transferred to our plate 

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:24.520
 we are now pouring light salt 

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:29.280
 and we prepare a few spoons of sauce 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:35.680
 you can also use garlic yogurt 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:39.800
 to eat 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.160
