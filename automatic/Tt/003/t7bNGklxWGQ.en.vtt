 portal glass and finger all mobile

 entertainment on glafi.com 

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:19.099
 hello everyone with you to the goal 73 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:21.710
 and today we talk about the Soviet 

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:23.539
 heavy tank of the tenth level of 4 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:25.310
 in the Soviet study tree 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:29.000
 there are two heavy tanks 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:31.849
 This is IS-7 and from 4 it is our today's 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000
 the hero is better than his brother in everything let's 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:37.519
 start from gun to damage per shot we 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.559
 We give our colleague a breakthrough with us 

00:00:37.519 --> 00:00:42.019
 also smaller but not significant 

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:44.840
 only 2 millimeter difference but in 

00:00:42.019 --> 00:00:47.440
 the rest of the gun with 4 is better in everything 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:51.460
 Our rate of fire is 5.3 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:53.899
 shots per minute while our dpm is 

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:56.180
 2226 enemy damage 

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:58.940
 with accuracy, we also have everything 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:01.609
 much better accuracy at 038 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:04.039
 and a mixing time of two seconds of course 

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:06.259
 won't let sniper shoot but all 

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:07.850
 shells will fall more often than this 

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:10.250
 happens on IS-7 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.360
 Now many will start talking about 

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.880
 Soviet guard 

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:16.970
 that is-7 and with its help is also pretty 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:20.119
 Often gets but from 4, too, Soviet 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:23.210
 tank and he also deftly gets from the turntables 

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:25.970
 now I see no point at all on dynamics 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:28.159
 talking about her on a heavy tank because 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:31.100
 our primary task of this 

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:33.409
 tank a small amount of damage but 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.280
 since we are considering a tank then why 

00:01:33.409 --> 00:01:37.189
 don't talk 

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:40.340
 with a mass of 61 tons and power 

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:43.280
 750 horsepower engine we have 

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:45.290
 power density of 12 horses per ton to 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.180
 we are rather slow though 

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:49.759
 maximum speed as much as forty three 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:52.520
 kilometer per hour we recruit it and reluctantly 

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:54.979
 but it is compensated by what we are talking about 

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:57.380
 talk further and we talk of course 

00:01:54.979 --> 00:02:01.240
 well as the famous booking of Isa 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:05.060
 the fourth she is gorgeous in the forehead 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:07.939
 140 millimeters on the sides 160a in the stern 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:11.030
 100 I think many have heard about 

00:02:07.939 --> 00:02:13.850
 impenetrable sides of this strand because they 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.680
 truly legendary from them ricochets 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:18.290
 largest calibers 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.760
 if the tank's reverse diamond 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:23.280
 precisely for his bead from 4 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:25.680
 so loved by many players as for 

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.290
 towers then in our forehead 250 millimeters 

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:31.470
 more than 200 and aft 170 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:34.049
 but not everything is as rosy as I would like 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:36.360
 we have very well below and May. 

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:39.180
 there even the first levels punch us 

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.560
 this plate on the roof of the tower is thick 

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.019
 only 30 millimeters 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.659
 know this and try not to give 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:48.359
 pull this point out of the equipment 

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:50.340
 I chose a reinforced rammer 

00:02:48.359 --> 00:02:52.890
 drives pickup and a stabilizer 

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:56.190
 we need stabilizer in order to 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:59.040
 spinner worked as often as possible 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:01.709
 go to the tactics of warfare as 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.299
 of 4 sluggish car we are pretty 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:06.299
 a long way to reach the target 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:08.639
 so while driving try 

00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:11.010
 do damage thanks to our hidden 

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:13.560
 perk as soon as you reach the place 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:16.139
 destination tank reverse rhombus from 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:18.690
 any shelters and after you see 

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:20.819
 that the enemy was shot and do not be afraid to leave 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:23.790
 and give damage to it also you can 

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:25.650
 actively use the tower but only in 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:28.470
 places where there is a small crease 

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:31.139
 areas to the enemy was harder 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:33.239
 aiming your vulnerable point also 

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:35.669
 if you like just scratch your armor 

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:38.370
 your tank can use 

00:03:35.669 --> 00:03:40.230
 tactics swing rolling out and sharply 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.120
 rolled back the enemy will 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:44.910
 make a shot which most often 

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:47.970
 will ricochet go away so we tank 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:50.549
 tank and once again let's tank 

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:53.400
 consider all the pros and cons of this 

00:03:50.549 --> 00:03:56.579
 car pluses can be attributed 

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:59.280
 great booking good accuracy 

00:03:56.579 --> 00:04:02.310
 more hp than y 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:05.400
 sibling to the minuses bad dynamics and 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:08.010
 vulnerable plate on the tower summing up 

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:10.769
 I want to say that of 4 can put in 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:12.720
 Hangar is absolutely any player for the weak 

00:04:10.769 --> 00:04:15.540
 players he will serve as an excellent simulator 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:17.789
 for the ability to tank but experienced tank crews 

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:20.519
 they themselves know what to do on 

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:23.190
 armored cars well and on this i 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:25.050
 you say goodbye to everyone thanks for watching 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:27.090
