00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.840
 come a culture that you do not need 

00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:05.160
 to pass is the chicory culture 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.919
 curly chicory or chicory 

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:11.690
 a culture that is practiced right after 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.690
 potatoes or shallots 

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:17.190
 but first of all you have to work well 

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:18.960
 its soil that is to say that you go 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.430
 eliminate all weapons the herbs 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.470
 undesirable then useless to go in 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.119
 depth is it is useless 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:25.170
 since the escarole will not need 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.289
 from a deep ground 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:30.300
 so we claw on the surface it is necessary that 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:32.220
 you scratched your soil well we're going 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.080
 to draw our rays and for that I have a 

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:37.440
 technique that is quite interesting 

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:39.900
 I use a rake and on this boat 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:42.360
 I sneak two small pieces of two 

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:48.899
 tubes apart to 30 cm what will me 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:54.170
 allow to radiate one so radiates to 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:57.329
 30 cm is taken up and so on 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:01:00.149
 to the end of our board once 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:03.360
 you have finished tracing what is 

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:06.000
 important is to pack well 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:10.800
 spend his land please 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.950
 stomp on it so we'll sow our 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:15.869
 chicory escaroles it is seeds 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:17.280
 in relation to these big years the 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:18.720
 endive chicory that is part of 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.290
 all the chicories that make a flower 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.930
 blue and it's gone you'll notice 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.880
 that I rather hold on the broad enough 

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.380
 in my department these volunteers with this 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.509
 in this case chicory scaroles needs air 

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:32.549
 to be so two rounds 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:34.770
 endive chicory we continue to 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:38.250
 stomp on the ground is now at 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:42.960
 practice to that of curly chicory 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:46.200
 always in this moment come the seeds 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:51.509
 which are very similar on the 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:53.759
 width of what I traced and we're going 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:55.850
 sow chicory chicory the agreement 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.560
 is in play now to finish 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:01.170
 so three salads that is consumed at 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:03.090
 fall before winter and that are 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.840
 still despite being resistant to 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.630
 first frosts 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.590
 So I make you in private and we love each other 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:12.060
 all our veins 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:14.190
 always on the spacing here is the seedling 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.630
 is over so now we 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.590
 let's go back to the lighthouse dry land 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:21.300
 above 

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:26.640
 with the claw or a pro one arrives there by 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:31.099
 above once we've sown we're going 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:35.489
 cover our smi with a burlap 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:37.530
 over and we water copiously on 

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:40.140
 the jute canvas in principle by a 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.040
 short week the endive chicory and 

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:42.780
 catch figures and go 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.010
 start to rise 15 days three 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.860
 weeks later you will practice the 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:49.500
 first transplanting transplanted to 30 cm 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:51.480
 quinconce thing promised thing due three 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.440
 weeks later our chicory is 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.329
 good to be transplanted 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.579
 so if chicory has grown well 

00:02:54.329 --> 00:02:58.709
 herbs too but it does not matter 

00:02:56.579 --> 00:03:00.510
 so we're going to transplant them now after 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:02.400
 a good watering we water them 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:03.510
 copiously it's useless to wait 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.849
 they are too big before 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:09.360
 transplant and then the principle is enough 

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:12.629
 simple one pulls on a salad if she 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:17.250
 wants to come here so that's the root on 

00:03:12.629 --> 00:03:19.079
 lightly cut the leaves to 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:21.299
 half and our endive chicory 

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:23.569
 nishikori as a rule are good 

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:23.569
 to transplant
