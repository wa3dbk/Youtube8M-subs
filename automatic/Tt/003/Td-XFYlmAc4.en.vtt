 let's 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.200
 in this lesson we will talk about 

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:19.450
 the relevance of classical chemical 

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:22.720
 Curling Fashion Trends Replace Each 

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:23.290
 friend curly wavy hair replace 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:26.230
 straight lines 

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:28.180
 and then curly back again 

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:30.699
 hair with large volume 

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:31.510
 such years usually come first 

00:00:30.699 --> 00:00:34.540
 coming out 

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:37.629
 perm known cases when 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:40.949
 some hairdressers and popularity 

00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:43.559
 did on 10 chemical curls sven 

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:46.329
 earning huge money 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:49.329
 classic perm scheme 

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:53.410
 it makes no sense to apply on very long 

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:56.440
 hair 50 60 centimeters is a priority 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:59.100
 spiral wrap scheme and thick 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:02.320
 hair cut and in one circuit 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.149
 crush the perm and will not give 

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:08.710
 opportunities to show curl 

00:01:04.149 --> 00:01:11.229
 therefore, ideally, you need to hold a gradation 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:14.289
 length by volume area for cheating 

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:17.439
 choose approximately the width of the roller 

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:19.530
 hide-and-seek using a comb with 

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:22.470
 knitting needles for quality performance 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:25.810
 perm perm should be 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:28.720
 profiled because those ends 

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:31.810
 which are made rigid transverse 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:34.180
 cut very often after chemical 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:36.970
 Curls are straight 

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:39.450
 cheat performed with a mandatory 

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:46.119
 using special parchment 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:52.380
 we wrap the tip after that in the middle 

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:52.380
 nki we put the roller and perform cheat 

00:01:56.480 --> 00:02:01.520
 Before, some masters did not use 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:03.620
 parchment so after chemical 

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.750
 Curl necessarily need 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:09.080
 it was cutting the ends 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:12.350
 now it is not required if not 

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:16.010
 apply parchment then the ends of the hair will be 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:18.410
 when cheating crash really and then 

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:21.380
 after doing a perm 

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:24.500
 will be very crumpled cheat 

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:27.940
 should not be very tough because 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:31.010
 if you strongly prebiotic head rollers 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:33.260
 later when applied 

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:37.180
 will not penetrate the tip intensity 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:40.310
 the curl is not formed by the force of tension 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:43.070
 it forms the selected diameter 

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:45.830
 the smaller you take the diameter of those 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:48.620
 curl is more intense there is a process 

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:51.820
 perm we perform strictly 

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:55.640
 on technology only after execution 

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:58.820
 learn to do a full roll on a roller 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:00.470
 perm because while you 

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:03.380
 old fashioned ironing and 

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:07.630
 and spreading someone's hair with 

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:07.630
 curls attracts your years
