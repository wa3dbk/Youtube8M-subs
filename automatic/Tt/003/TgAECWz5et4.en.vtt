my my advice to you is if you want to

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:57.570 
my my advice to you is if you want to
take<00:02:53.720> this<00:02:53.840> video<00:02:54.170> and<00:02:54.470> pause<00:02:55.250> it<00:02:56.080> when<00:02:57.080> a

00:02:57.570 --> 00:02:57.580 
take this video and pause it when a

00:02:57.580 --> 00:02:59.229 
take this video and pause it when a
moment<00:02:58.580> where<00:02:58.730> its<00:02:58.849> showing<00:02:58.910> all<00:02:59.209> the

00:02:59.229 --> 00:02:59.239 
moment where its showing all the

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:04.100 
your map and then you will be able to

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:06.490 
your map and then you will be able to
obviously<00:03:04.790> match<00:03:05.480> them<00:03:05.720> up<00:03:05.810> and<00:03:06.079> find<00:03:06.290> the

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:11.660 
trophies I will be doing a tutorial

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:15.400 
trophies I will be doing a tutorial
thing<00:03:12.350> on<00:03:12.590> how<00:03:12.920> to<00:03:12.980> a<00:03:13.370> walkthrough<00:03:14.060> on<00:03:14.410> where

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:15.410 
thing on how to a walkthrough on where

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:17.080 
thing on how to a walkthrough on where
they<00:03:15.590> all<00:03:15.799> are<00:03:15.829> in<00:03:16.220> the<00:03:16.370> big<00:03:16.549> individual

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:17.090 
they all are in the big individual

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:18.670 
they all are in the big individual
buildings<00:03:17.510> because<00:03:18.079> I'm<00:03:18.260> not<00:03:18.410> going<00:03:18.560> to<00:03:18.620> do

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:18.680 
buildings because I'm not going to do

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.380 
buildings because I'm not going to do
the<00:03:18.799> whole<00:03:18.920> city<00:03:19.190> because<00:03:19.700> that<00:03:19.850> take<00:03:20.090> me<00:03:20.209> ages

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:20.390 
the whole city because that take me ages

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:22.150 
the whole city because that take me ages
and<00:03:20.810> I<00:03:20.870> think<00:03:21.079> you<00:03:21.230> can<00:03:21.410> find<00:03:21.590> yourselves

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.160 
and I think you can find yourselves

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.470 
and I think you can find yourselves
because<00:03:22.700> it's<00:03:22.970> not<00:03:23.209> too<00:03:23.540> hard<00:03:24.400> so<00:03:25.480> basically

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:26.480 
because it's not too hard so basically

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.319 
because it's not too hard so basically
that's<00:03:26.600> the<00:03:26.810> war<00:03:27.049> room<00:03:27.760> that's<00:03:28.760> where<00:03:29.120> all<00:03:29.269> the

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:29.329 
that's the war room that's where all the

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:30.610 
that's the war room that's where all the
water<00:03:29.480> is<00:03:29.810> in<00:03:29.959> the<00:03:30.049> middle<00:03:30.200> of<00:03:30.319> that<00:03:30.470> big

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:30.620 
water is in the middle of that big

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:34.180 
water is in the middle of that big
chamber<00:03:31.060> that's<00:03:32.060> the<00:03:32.209> iceberg<00:03:32.780> lounge<00:03:33.190> where

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:34.190 
chamber that's the iceberg lounge where

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:37.569 
chamber that's the iceberg lounge where
you<00:03:34.400> fight<00:03:34.700> penguin<00:03:35.950> no<00:03:36.950> you<00:03:37.010> are<00:03:37.220> be<00:03:37.370> able<00:03:37.489> to

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:46.940 
going up to the armory and there's quite

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:48.729 
going up to the armory and there's quite
a<00:03:46.970> few<00:03:47.030> in<00:03:47.239> there<00:03:47.389> Catwoman<00:03:47.989> trophies<00:03:48.590> in

00:03:48.729 --> 00:03:48.739 
a few in there Catwoman trophies in

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:51.180 
a few in there Catwoman trophies in
there

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:51.190 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:53.410 

didn't<00:03:52.190> mean<00:03:52.250> to<00:03:52.310> mix<00:03:52.580> it<00:03:52.760> the<00:03:53.030> whole<00:03:53.209> thing

00:03:53.410 --> 00:03:53.420 
didn't mean to mix it the whole thing

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:57.369 
didn't mean to mix it the whole thing
there<00:03:54.280> so<00:03:55.280> this<00:03:56.030> is<00:03:56.180> the<00:03:56.299> steel<00:03:56.510> mill<00:03:56.750> Joker's

00:03:57.369 --> 00:03:57.379 
there so this is the steel mill Joker's

00:03:57.379 --> 00:04:04.000 
there so this is the steel mill Joker's
hideout<00:04:01.810> some<00:04:02.810> of<00:04:02.959> the<00:04:03.080> rooms<00:04:03.440> I<00:04:03.680> haven't

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.010 
hideout some of the rooms I haven't

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:08.319 
hideout some of the rooms I haven't
actually<00:04:04.159> discovered<00:04:04.970> in<00:04:05.180> this<00:04:05.720> place<00:04:07.180> but<00:04:08.180> I

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:08.329 
actually discovered in this place but I

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:10.960 
actually discovered in this place but I
think<00:04:08.659> those<00:04:09.319> trophies<00:04:09.709> there<00:04:10.129> are<00:04:10.370> from<00:04:10.790> when

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:10.970 
think those trophies there are from when

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:13.809 
think those trophies there are from when
you<00:04:11.150> come<00:04:11.360> down<00:04:11.540> the<00:04:11.750> massive<00:04:12.140> chimney<00:04:12.670> but<00:04:13.670> I

00:04:13.809 --> 00:04:13.819 
you come down the massive chimney but I

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:15.430 
you come down the massive chimney but I
think<00:04:13.940> you'll<00:04:14.269> be<00:04:14.329> able<00:04:14.510> to<00:04:14.750> find<00:04:14.930> them<00:04:15.140> anyway

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:15.440 
think you'll be able to find them anyway

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:17.289 
think you'll be able to find them anyway
if<00:04:15.739> you've<00:04:16.190> got<00:04:16.430> the<00:04:16.549> whole<00:04:16.669> map<00:04:16.940> because

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:17.299 
if you've got the whole map because

00:04:17.299 --> 00:04:22.680 
if you've got the whole map because
they'll<00:04:17.540> just<00:04:18.070> appear<00:04:19.070> on<00:04:19.250> there<00:04:19.459> anyway<00:04:19.880> so

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:22.690 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:26.620 

there<00:04:23.690> are<00:04:23.840> quite<00:04:24.080> a<00:04:24.139> few<00:04:24.260> in<00:04:24.560> there<00:04:25.630> just

00:05:53.369 --> 00:05:53.379 
time to look for them that's the sub

00:05:53.379 --> 00:05:55.800 
time to look for them that's the sub
that's<00:05:53.650> the<00:05:53.919> processing<00:05:54.759> center<00:05:55.210> where<00:05:55.240> you

00:05:55.800 --> 00:05:55.810
