00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:11.219
 hello how are you talking to all of them xx alex 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:14.849
 10 and today I come to offer you that 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:17.040
 solution for adobe illustrator where 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.950
 that can not be started in windows 8 

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:24.090
 this is a problem 

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:27.360
 has windows 8 that does not have a crib 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.970
 very exact compatibility with adobe 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:32.189
 illustrator and when one wants to open the 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:35.270
 adobe illustrator program in Spanish 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.520
 this error automatically occurs 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.900
 and it tells us that this application is 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.120
 compatible with the system language 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:44.600
 current operative but for more than 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:46.730
 we try to change the language 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.100
 for programs the only thing that we're not going to 

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:50.780
 able to solve the problem and although 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:54.070
 we change any new language not 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.070
 we will be able to solve the problem 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:59.440
 the solution would be to copy a 

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:03.239
 file that 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.239
 so that our program works 

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:07.490
 I can not come 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:11.039
 and I have here two adobe illustrator 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:15.780
 one is 64 bits and the other is 32 

00:01:11.039 --> 00:01:17.540
 bits to this administrator I already have 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.590
 locked 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.090
 so I can enter without any 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:23.750
 problems 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:25.850
 and now I'm going to show you how it is that 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:30.909
 you can create on one side 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:30.909
 illustrator of that series of 32 bits 

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.469
 the program is not loading 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.720
 and you can see that the program 

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:52.480
 had successfully loaded but what 

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:55.630
 I want to do is at this moment is 

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:58.210
 show them how to free the 32 bit and 

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:00.120
 64 bits both 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:02.450
 for both cases 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:07.130
 this is the 32 bit 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:08.679
 this file to the cit point of ll what 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.049
 let's copy 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:13.180
 where is our adobe folder 

00:02:11.049 --> 00:02:16.730
 illustrator now in the location of the 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:20.050
 program and you 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:20.050
 I just see it 

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.340
 will not replace or omit files 

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:25.340
 than to replace it 

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:36.550
 automatically this 

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:38.670
 our problem with adobe 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:38.670
 illustrator 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.670
 we wait a few moments for him to load us 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:45.220
 the program 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:47.760
 and we 'll see and see if it really has 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.760
 operated 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:55.689
 probably adobe illustrator or the 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:59.500
 adobe company since a solution or 

00:02:55.689 --> 00:03:01.540
 windows itself take care of 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:04.030
 and solve this problem that 

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:06.760
 it only happens with windows 8 I know 

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:09.810
 that many have regretted having 

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:13.569
 installed windows 8 but 

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:17.969
 I do not know how to martyrize this has a solution 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:17.969
 the solution is in their 

00:03:32.990 --> 00:03:37.989
 the problem charged 

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:40.650
 Well I'm going to leave the medicines 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:43.430
 down in the youtube comments 

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:47.260
 I hope you have served them 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:47.260
 comment, I like it
