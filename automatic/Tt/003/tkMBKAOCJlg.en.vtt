00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
that third shot I believe that was a

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.340 
that third shot I believe that was a
lefty<00:02:51.120> and<00:02:51.209> a<00:02:51.540> first<00:02:51.780> shot<00:02:51.959> was<00:02:52.049> a<00:02:52.110> righty

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
lefty and a first shot was a righty

watch there's the drag there's the

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.030 
watch there's the drag there's the
option<00:02:54.660> to<00:02:54.870> shoot<00:02:55.140> but<00:02:55.440> this<00:02:55.560> time<00:02:55.709> I<00:02:55.799> decide

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
option to shoot but this time I decide

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.190 
option to shoot but this time I decide
to<00:02:56.069> go<00:02:56.220> backhand<00:02:56.459> so<00:02:57.150> the<00:02:57.269> option<00:02:57.660> is<00:02:57.989> right

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
to go backhand so the option is right

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.539 
to go backhand so the option is right
before<00:02:58.380> you<00:02:58.650> can<00:02:58.769> either<00:02:58.890> shoot<00:02:59.130> it<00:02:59.280> or<00:02:59.400> go

can't remember and their third in the

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.610 
can't remember and their third in the
NHL<00:04:32.820> I<00:04:32.850> believe<00:04:33.180> so<00:04:33.690> Dallas<00:04:34.139> you<00:04:34.410> know<00:04:34.440> they

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:34.620 
NHL I believe so Dallas you know they

00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:35.600 
NHL I believe so Dallas you know they
got<00:04:34.770> something<00:04:34.980> going<00:04:35.310> there

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:35.610 
got something going there

00:04:35.610 --> 00:04:37.580 
got something going there
Dallas<00:04:36.240> see<00:04:36.360> I<00:04:36.389> don't<00:04:36.900> get<00:04:37.020> to<00:04:37.169> watch<00:04:37.320> them

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:37.590 
Dallas see I don't get to watch them

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:39.469 
Dallas see I don't get to watch them
enough<00:04:37.800> so<00:04:37.919> I<00:04:37.949> really<00:04:38.250> don't<00:04:38.340> get<00:04:38.490> to<00:04:38.550> see<00:04:39.449> what

00:04:39.469 --> 00:04:39.479 
enough so I really don't get to see what

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:41.570 
enough so I really don't get to see what
they're<00:04:39.750> doing<00:04:39.780> my<00:04:40.500> opinion<00:04:41.010> based<00:04:41.250> on<00:04:41.400> them

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:41.580 
they're doing my opinion based on them

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:43.040 
they're doing my opinion based on them
not<00:04:41.760> making<00:04:42.000> the<00:04:42.090> playoffs<00:04:42.270> was<00:04:42.570> just<00:04:42.750> because

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.050 
not making the playoffs was just because

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:44.629 
not making the playoffs was just because
they<00:04:43.500> didn't<00:04:43.710> make<00:04:43.800> the<00:04:43.919> playoffs<00:04:44.220> last<00:04:44.370> year

00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:44.639 
they didn't make the playoffs last year

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:46.969 
they didn't make the playoffs last year
I<00:04:44.669> know<00:04:44.729> they<00:04:44.970> made<00:04:45.150> 95<00:04:45.870> points<00:04:46.110> which<00:04:46.680> should

00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:46.979 
I know they made 95 points which should

00:04:46.979 --> 00:04:48.350 
I know they made 95 points which should
be<00:04:47.130> enough<00:04:47.370> to<00:04:47.490> get<00:04:47.580> you<00:04:47.760> into<00:04:47.940> the<00:04:48.030> playoffs

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.360 
be enough to get you into the playoffs

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:50.240 
be enough to get you into the playoffs
but<00:04:48.930> the<00:04:49.229> reason<00:04:49.530> I<00:04:49.620> said<00:04:49.830> they're<00:04:49.919> not<00:04:50.070> making

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:50.250 
but the reason I said they're not making

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:51.409 
but the reason I said they're not making
the<00:04:50.430> playoffs<00:04:50.520> this<00:04:50.790> year<00:04:50.850> is<00:04:51.030> because<00:04:51.300> they

00:04:51.409 --> 00:04:51.419 
the playoffs this year is because they

00:04:51.419 --> 00:04:53.450 
the playoffs this year is because they
lost<00:04:51.600> Brad<00:04:51.930> Richards<00:04:52.169> and<00:04:52.500> they<00:04:52.919> they<00:04:53.250> only

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:53.460 
lost Brad Richards and they they only

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.730 
lost Brad Richards and they they only
added<00:04:53.790> Michael<00:04:54.060> Ryder<00:04:54.300> so<00:04:54.690> we're<00:04:55.410> gonna<00:04:55.500> see

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:55.740 
added Michael Ryder so we're gonna see

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:57.140 
added Michael Ryder so we're gonna see
though<00:04:55.919> we'll<00:04:56.070> see<00:04:56.190> what<00:04:56.310> they<00:04:56.400> got<00:04:56.550> and<00:04:56.760> for

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:57.150
