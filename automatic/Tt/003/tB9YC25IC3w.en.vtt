and this brush is fantastic because it's

00:06:01.620 --> 00:06:05.090 
and this brush is fantastic because it's
tapered<00:06:02.100> to<00:06:02.699> exactly<00:06:03.210> do<00:06:03.449> all<00:06:04.410> the<00:06:04.650> work<00:06:04.800> for

00:06:05.090 --> 00:06:05.100 
tapered to exactly do all the work for

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:07.070 
tapered to exactly do all the work for
you<00:06:05.190> so<00:06:05.370> it<00:06:05.460> literally<00:06:06.120> follows<00:06:06.660> that<00:06:06.870> line

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:07.080 
you so it literally follows that line
