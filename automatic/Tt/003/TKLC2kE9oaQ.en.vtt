00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.960
 do 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.430
 a whirlwind of blades the background becomes 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.079
 Immune to damage and deals 150 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:43.530

 cooldown ability does not require rage 

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.920
 disarming for 10 seconds robs 

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:55.100
 the enemy weapons he holds in 

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.879
 right hand and ranged weapons 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.769
 rampant recovery 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:00.510
 recovers 36 percent from 

00:00:58.769 --> 00:01:03.329
 maximum health for 10 

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.750
 seconds three minutes heroic cooldown 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.690

 1 minute cooldown 40 meter radius 

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:10.050
 jumps to the specified place and cause damage 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.160
 heroic jump maybe 

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:12.869
 used to dial 

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:15.119
 distance to dash into the enemy 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:17.070
 heroically one minute cooldown 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.899
 warrior throws melee weapons and 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.300
 deals damage based on attack power 

00:01:18.899 --> 00:01:23.160
 improved tendon trimming your 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:25.410
 cuts dryly lived two times in a row and 

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:28.530
 immobilizes the enemy for 5 seconds 30 

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:31.050
 seconds cooldown awesome scream 2 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:34.500
 minutes the cooldown sends opponents to 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:38.039
 a radius of 8 meters fear for 8 seconds is not 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:40.050
 45 seconds eruption angle off 

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:42.390
 legs and stuns her for 5 seconds 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:44.099
 recklessness five minutes cooldown 

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.649
 increases the chance of critical damage 

00:01:44.099 --> 00:01:48.810
 abilities not 50 percent increase 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:49.709
 20 percent damage lasts 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.340
 12 seconds 

00:01:49.709 --> 00:01:55.289
 retaliation for 12 you instantly counter 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:57.800
 attack the enemy attacking you in 

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:57.800
 melee 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:18.030
 in my battle to us first i prefer 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.430
 use improved cropping 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.590
 tendons and then i start to put like 

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.239
 can be more damage 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.099
 it is very important to resist correctly 

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:27.629
 war maneuver for example if he 

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:29.040
 makes a heroic leap to 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:33.569
 make a dash for you you must 

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:35.310
 immediately include a whirl of blades if 

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:37.230
 he use retribution you should 

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.120
 disarm him and immediately knock him down 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:41.099
 try to keep up the slaughter 

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.810
 cutting tendons so he could not 

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:45.150
 try not to miss you 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.580
 retribution get rid of effect 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:50.519
 knocking down hope you enjoyed it
