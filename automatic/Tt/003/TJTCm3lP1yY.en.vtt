00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:00.040 
super crisp and super perfect because if

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:01.530 
super crisp and super perfect because if
you<00:02:00.160> don't<00:02:00.310> have<00:02:00.520> it<00:02:00.670> perfect<00:02:01.060> and<00:02:01.180> it's<00:02:01.330> not

going<00:02:01.780> to<00:02:01.930> look<00:02:02.050> good<00:02:02.260> so<00:02:02.560> that's<00:02:03.460> just<00:02:03.640> what

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:03.820 
going to look good so that's just what

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.060 
going to look good so that's just what
we<00:02:03.910> started<00:02:04.240> doing<00:02:04.300> it<00:02:04.660> feels<00:02:05.050> gross<00:02:05.350> and<00:02:05.890> then

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:06.070 
we started doing it feels gross and then

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:09.180 
we started doing it feels gross and then
farther<00:02:06.790> down<00:02:07.060> you<00:02:07.420> have<00:02:08.110> more<00:02:08.380> dangerous

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
farther down you have more dangerous

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:11.880 
farther down you have more dangerous
tape<00:02:09.899> okay<00:02:10.899> so<00:02:10.960> we<00:02:11.170> ran<00:02:11.320> out<00:02:11.410> of<00:02:11.440> painters<00:02:11.740> tape

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
tape okay so we ran out of painters tape

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:13.470 
tape okay so we ran out of painters tape
to<00:02:11.950> read<00:02:12.190> to<00:02:12.250> go<00:02:12.340> to<00:02:12.400> Walmart<00:02:12.610> and<00:02:12.880> get<00:02:13.030> more<00:02:13.270> so

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.870 
to read to go to Walmart and get more so

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
that's why it changes colors and yeah

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.150 
that's why it changes colors and yeah

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:47.550 
basement and it worked pretty well so

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:49.400

just paint paint paint and you have to
do<00:02:49.500> multiple<00:02:49.920> codes<00:02:50.130> because<00:02:50.310> you<00:02:50.430> can<00:02:50.550> still

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
do multiple codes because you can still

00:02:50.760 --> 00:03:16.290 
do multiple codes because you can still
see<00:02:50.820> the<00:02:51.030> page

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:16.300 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:19.650 

I<00:03:16.330> do<00:03:16.720> we

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:19.660 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:49.960 

before<00:03:20.410> you<00:03:20.560> were<00:03:20.680> born

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:49.970 

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:57.650 

sure

00:03:57.650 --> 00:03:57.660 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:00.200 

so<00:03:58.440> my<00:03:58.590> roller<00:03:58.800> bus<00:03:59.040> decided<00:03:59.460> to<00:03:59.550> break<00:03:59.820> on<00:04:00.030> me

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:00.210 
so my roller bus decided to break on me

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:03.560 
so my roller bus decided to break on me
so<00:04:00.570> I<00:04:00.870> spent<00:04:01.620> a<00:04:01.860> good<00:04:02.220> amount<00:04:02.280> of<00:04:02.520> time<00:04:02.670> messing

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:03.570 
so I spent a good amount of time messing

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:04.790 
so I spent a good amount of time messing
with<00:04:03.600> my<00:04:03.900> roller<00:04:04.140> brush<00:04:04.320> because<00:04:04.470> it<00:04:04.650> kept

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:04.800 
with my roller brush because it kept

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:07.130 
with my roller brush because it kept
falling<00:04:05.220> off<00:04:05.370> and<00:04:05.640> I<00:04:06.180> just<00:04:06.600> kind<00:04:06.780> of<00:04:06.840> gave<00:04:06.990> up

00:04:07.130 --> 00:04:07.140 
falling off and I just kind of gave up

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:08.420 
falling off and I just kind of gave up
on<00:04:07.320> that<00:04:07.350> and<00:04:07.680> then<00:04:07.770> Deb<00:04:08.010> grabbing<00:04:08.400> a

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:08.430 
on that and then Deb grabbing a

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:10.640 
on that and then Deb grabbing a
paintbrush<00:04:08.760> later<00:04:09.180> the<00:04:09.990> roller<00:04:10.230> brush<00:04:10.440> makes

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
paintbrush later the roller brush makes

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.650 
paintbrush later the roller brush makes
a<00:04:10.770> lot<00:04:10.980> easier<00:04:11.400> and<00:04:11.430> we<00:04:11.700> had<00:04:11.850> smaller<00:04:12.270> roller

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:12.660 
a lot easier and we had smaller roller

00:04:12.660 --> 00:05:12.690 
a lot easier and we had smaller roller
brushes

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:12.700 

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:18.780 

we<00:05:13.700> say<00:05:14.600> on<00:05:14.720> repeat

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:18.790 

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:21.010 

okay<00:05:19.790> so<00:05:19.850> then<00:05:20.120> we<00:05:20.180> decided<00:05:20.570> to<00:05:20.630> have<00:05:20.720> glitter

00:05:21.010 --> 00:05:21.020

okay so then we decided to have glitter
and<00:05:21.290> this<00:05:21.800> was<00:05:21.980> a<00:05:22.010> last-minute<00:05:22.370> thing<00:05:22.550> we<00:05:22.940> were

paint from Walmart I think was five
dollars<00:05:28.250> and<00:05:28.670> we<00:05:29.630> just<00:05:30.260> sprayed<00:05:30.620> glitter<00:05:31.010> all

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:31.250 
dollars and we just sprayed glitter all

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:33.310 
dollars and we just sprayed glitter all
over<00:05:31.280> the<00:05:31.760> white<00:05:31.940> fumes<00:05:32.480> were<00:05:32.660> really<00:05:33.080> bad<00:05:33.260> I

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:33.320 
over the white fumes were really bad I

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:35.470 
over the white fumes were really bad I
actually<00:05:33.680> had<00:05:34.010> to<00:05:34.130> leave<00:05:34.280> the<00:05:34.430> room<00:05:34.610> because<00:05:35.030> I

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:35.480 
actually had to leave the room because I

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:37.570 
actually had to leave the room because I
couldn't<00:05:35.900> believe<00:05:36.050> in<00:05:36.410> my<00:05:36.800> house<00:05:36.950> meant<00:05:37.280> for

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:37.580 
couldn't believe in my house meant for

00:05:37.580 --> 00:05:42.980 
couldn't believe in my house meant for
the<00:05:37.670> bad<00:05:37.850> now<00:05:38.060> from<00:05:38.300> that

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:42.990 

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:46.200 

so<00:05:43.990> then<00:05:44.170> you<00:05:44.350> slowly<00:05:44.950> peel<00:05:45.580> off<00:05:45.760> the<00:05:45.910> painters

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:46.210 
so then you slowly peel off the painters

00:05:46.210 --> 00:05:48.360 
so then you slowly peel off the painters
tape<00:05:46.360> because<00:05:46.960> it<00:05:47.230> will<00:05:47.650> peel<00:05:47.920> off<00:05:47.950> the<00:05:48.160> paint

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:48.370 
tape because it will peel off the paint

00:05:48.370 --> 00:05:50.790 
tape because it will peel off the paint
if<00:05:48.460> it's<00:05:48.610> not<00:05:48.760> completely<00:05:49.150> dry<00:05:50.050> yet<00:05:50.350> you<00:05:50.650> need

00:05:50.790 --> 00:05:50.800 
if it's not completely dry yet you need

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:53.520 
if it's not completely dry yet you need
to<00:05:50.920> make<00:05:51.070> sure<00:05:51.100> like<00:05:51.550> it's<00:05:51.850> dry<00:05:52.750> we<00:05:53.290> waited

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:53.530 
to make sure like it's dry we waited

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:56.420 
to make sure like it's dry we waited
like<00:05:53.650> an<00:05:53.770> hour<00:05:53.920> before<00:05:54.190> we<00:05:54.370> peel<00:05:54.520> off<00:05:54.670> the<00:05:54.760> tape

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:56.430 
like an hour before we peel off the tape

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:58.680 
like an hour before we peel off the tape
me<00:05:57.430> and<00:05:57.520> my<00:05:57.580> cousin<00:05:57.880> were<00:05:57.970> pretty<00:05:58.180> much<00:05:58.330> peeing

00:05:58.680 --> 00:05:58.690 
me and my cousin were pretty much peeing

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:00.690 
me and my cousin were pretty much peeing
