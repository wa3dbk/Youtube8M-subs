00:00:01.429 --> 00:00:09.589
 hello I do u fried potatoes with 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.589
 vegetables 

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:18.449
 I prepared two potatoes until they 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:22.189
 lie like dry out on paper 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:22.189
 you half a bulb 

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:31.500
 see this vegetables from the freezer cabinet 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:33.480
 Here it is necessary to say that this vegetable 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.579
 never had such when they 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.800
 several times frozen art 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:40.379
 thawed because at us 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:43.260
 For more than a month there was no light 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:45.780
 turned on and off that's it of course 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:49.559
 wrong and right happened 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:54.960
 freezing on them is a lot of ice 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:58.590
 Well what can you do that I wanted to say very 

00:00:54.960 --> 00:01:01.859
 good to freeze and she and not frozen 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:04.739
 Here are the seeds of dill that I pulled out 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:07.890
 principle already almost before the most 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:10.080
 frost is very well preserved by me 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.439
 there still is a freezer and freezer 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.119
 very good smell well it's inflorescences 

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:19.640
 from dill recommend 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:20.970
 I liked what else do I need me 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:25.680
 cooked here 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:30.259
 broke the egg a little before you there flour 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:33.090
 i take some corn salt 

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:35.520
 mixed with greens and this is me kenzo 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.540
 Here I also cut her 

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:41.310
 strugova it is still frozen 

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:46.530
 so I had frozen 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:50.910
 molds well, and proceed to frying first 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:55.140
 it is necessary to melt the butter and put 

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:58.650
 I check the potatoes to have oil 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:03.320
 only warmed up 

00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:03.320
 spreading potatoes 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:26.920
 so all shuffle all at once throwing something 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:26.920
 what I think right now is unnecessary for the line 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:41.830
 I have already roasted one side a little 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:44.060
 doused with tepid water and vegetables too 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:49.030
 there was excess moisture 

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:49.030
 although before such and given white and 

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:56.650
 now I will fry it all as in 3 

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:56.650
 closes 

00:02:58.930 --> 00:03:10.990
 even pouring egg with greens still added 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:20.200
 semi teaspoons here sour cream and 

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:20.200
 cover so sprinkle still dill 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:43.020
 I have such a potato with vegetables 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:43.020

00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:49.840
