00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:14.730 

here's<00:00:07.940> a<00:00:08.030> very<00:00:08.390> easy<00:00:08.750> way<00:00:09.100> to<00:00:12.820> propagate

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:14.740 
here's a very easy way to propagate

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:19.929 
here's a very easy way to propagate
pakistanis<00:00:15.740> and<00:00:17.890> container<00:00:18.890> on<00:00:19.220> the<00:00:19.279> any

00:00:19.929 --> 00:00:19.939 
pakistanis and container on the any

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:23.830

container<00:00:20.450> the<00:00:21.290> young<00:00:21.860> water<00:00:22.539> and<00:00:23.539> some

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:23.840 
container the young water and some

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:27.340 
container the young water and some
clumping<00:00:24.289> close<00:00:24.800> the<00:00:25.039> purpose<00:00:25.460> and<00:00:26.199> you<00:00:27.199> can

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:27.350 
clumping close the purpose and you can

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:29.740 
clumping close the purpose and you can
get<00:00:27.500> in<00:00:27.590> the<00:00:27.680> root<00:00:28.210> so<00:00:29.210> we're<00:00:29.390> just<00:00:29.539> going<00:00:29.660> to

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:29.750 
get in the root so we're just going to

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:35.170 
get in the root so we're just going to
take<00:00:29.900> some<00:00:29.930> leaves<00:00:30.320> off<00:00:30.529> the<00:00:30.560> bottom<00:00:31.039> and<00:00:34.180> put

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:35.180 
take some leaves off the bottom and put

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:45.970 
take some leaves off the bottom and put
in<00:00:35.300> the<00:00:35.390> water

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:45.980 

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:54.580 

and<00:00:46.550> they<00:00:46.970> will<00:00:48.190> put<00:00:50.530> corn<00:00:51.530> roots<00:00:53.590> though

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:54.590 
and they will put corn roots though

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:57.580 
and they will put corn roots though
these<00:00:54.800> things<00:00:55.210> are<00:00:56.210> very<00:00:56.240> thing<00:00:56.780> you're

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.050 

sometimes<00:01:16.270> you<00:01:17.260> know<00:01:17.500> this<00:01:18.100> point<00:01:18.430> is<00:01:18.670> it<00:01:18.820> kind

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.060 
sometimes you know this point is it kind

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.600 
sometimes you know this point is it kind
of<00:01:19.090> ground<00:01:19.390> your<00:01:19.570> rooms<00:01:19.920> so<00:01:20.920> you<00:01:20.979> can<00:01:21.130> cut<00:01:21.430> that

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:21.610 
of ground your rooms so you can cut that

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:25.140 
of ground your rooms so you can cut that
off<00:01:21.750> and<00:01:22.750> get<00:01:22.960> the<00:01:23.229> spot<00:01:23.619> where<00:01:23.920> you<00:01:24.700> had<00:01:24.909> some

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:25.150 
off and get the spot where you had some

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:27.570 
off and get the spot where you had some
wings<00:01:25.450> and<00:01:25.780> it's<00:01:26.409> probably<00:01:26.950> the<00:01:27.009> area<00:01:27.340> where

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:27.580 
wings and it's probably the area where

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:36.719 
wings and it's probably the area where
the<00:01:27.729> rich<00:01:27.880> really<00:01:28.180> come<00:01:28.330> on<00:01:35.369> and<00:01:36.369> of<00:01:36.460> course

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:36.729 
the rich really come on and of course

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:38.190 
the rich really come on and of course
you<00:01:37.090> have<00:01:37.240> them<00:01:37.360> in<00:01:37.420> the<00:01:37.509> container<00:01:37.930> where<00:01:38.170> you

00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 
you have them in the container where you

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.690 
you have them in the container where you
can<00:01:38.440> see<00:01:38.909> when<00:01:39.909> they<00:01:40.060> start<00:01:40.360> growing<00:01:40.659> roots<00:01:41.700> so

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 
can see when they start growing roots so

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.300 
can see when they start growing roots so
I'm<00:01:42.850> going<00:01:43.000> to<00:01:43.060> go<00:01:43.149> ahead<00:01:43.270> and<00:01:43.950> finish<00:01:44.950> this<00:01:45.250> up
