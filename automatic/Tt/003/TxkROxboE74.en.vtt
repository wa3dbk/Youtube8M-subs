have to follow the pattern here you

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.470 
have to follow the pattern here you
can't<00:02:43.140> just<00:02:43.230> skip<00:02:43.530> from<00:02:44.459> the<00:02:44.880> first<00:02:45.150> one<00:02:45.360> all

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
can't just skip from the first one all

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:46.670 
can't just skip from the first one all
the<00:02:45.540> way<00:02:45.630> down<00:02:45.780> to<00:02:45.930> the<00:02:45.989> last<00:02:46.140> one<00:02:46.350> you<00:02:46.440> have<00:02:46.590> to

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
the way down to the last one you have to

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.160 
the way down to the last one you have to
do<00:02:46.800> these<00:02:46.920> in<00:02:47.100> order<00:02:47.250> so<00:02:48.150> that<00:02:48.180> town<00:02:48.810> gave<00:02:49.020> me

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
do these in order so that town gave me

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.300 
do these in order so that town gave me
four<00:02:49.410> points<00:02:49.800> so<00:02:50.100> I<00:02:50.130> would<00:02:50.550> put<00:02:50.900> four<00:02:52.310> right

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
four points so I would put four right

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:54.830 
four points so I would put four right
there<00:02:53.610> and<00:02:53.910> then<00:02:54.270> it<00:02:54.360> would<00:02:54.450> be<00:02:54.570> the<00:02:54.690> other

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:54.840 
there and then it would be the other

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.660 
there and then it would be the other
player's<00:02:55.110> turn<00:02:55.230> or<00:02:55.680> however<00:02:55.890> many<00:02:56.160> plays<00:02:56.459> you

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:56.670 
player's turn or however many plays you

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.610 
player's turn or however many plays you
have<00:02:56.700> it<00:02:56.970> goes<00:02:57.120> around<00:02:57.360> in<00:02:57.510> a<00:02:57.570> circle<00:02:57.620> so

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
have it goes around in a circle so

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.130 
have it goes around in a circle so
that's<00:02:58.860> how<00:02:59.190> the<00:02:59.580> play<00:02:59.760> goes<00:03:00.000> at<00:03:00.600> the<00:03:00.870> end<00:03:01.019> you

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
that's how the play goes at the end you

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:02.509 
that's how the play goes at the end you
add<00:03:01.320> it<00:03:01.440> up<00:03:01.560> and<00:03:01.799> the<00:03:01.950> person<00:03:02.100> with<00:03:02.400> the

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
add it up and the person with the

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:05.530 
add it up and the person with the
highest<00:03:02.670> score<00:03:03.120> wins

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.960 

so<00:03:06.540> the<00:03:06.930> big<00:03:07.110> question<00:03:07.290> is<00:03:07.739> do<00:03:08.280> I<00:03:08.340> like<00:03:08.700> the
