as you can see I'm kind of running low
on<00:03:32.770> these<00:03:33.070> products<00:03:33.640> so<00:03:34.060> we're<00:03:34.270> gonna<00:03:34.360> have<00:03:34.540> to

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:34.570 
on these products so we're gonna have to

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:37.470 
on these products so we're gonna have to
get<00:03:34.750> some<00:03:35.110> more<00:03:35.350> soon<00:03:35.710> but<00:03:36.400> you<00:03:37.060> can<00:03:37.180> tell<00:03:37.360> that

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:37.480 
get some more soon but you can tell that

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:39.390 
get some more soon but you can tell that
it's<00:03:37.630> like<00:03:37.840> working<00:03:38.230> so<00:03:38.500> this<00:03:38.740> is<00:03:38.950> an<00:03:39.100> actual

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:39.400 
it's like working so this is an actual

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.910 
it's like working so this is an actual
foam<00:03:40.000> so<00:03:40.450> we<00:03:40.570> used<00:03:40.780> about<00:03:40.930> three<00:03:41.350> pumps<00:03:41.740> of<00:03:41.860> the

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:41.920 
foam so we used about three pumps of the

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:45.449 
foam so we used about three pumps of the
foam<00:03:42.160> into<00:03:42.400> my<00:03:42.520> hand<00:03:42.760> and<00:03:43.630> I<00:03:44.230> wash<00:03:44.560> my<00:03:44.740> face<00:03:44.770> now

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:45.459 
foam into my hand and I wash my face now

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:48.480 
foam into my hand and I wash my face now
what<00:03:46.060> I<00:03:46.240> didn't<00:03:46.750> do<00:03:46.959> before<00:03:47.380> and<00:03:47.620> I<00:03:47.709> do<00:03:47.770> now<00:03:48.160> is

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:48.490 
what I didn't do before and I do now is

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:50.190 
what I didn't do before and I do now is
that<00:03:48.670> if<00:03:48.820> I<00:03:48.910> don't<00:03:49.030> have<00:03:49.120> makeup<00:03:49.330> on<00:03:49.600> I<00:03:49.810> wash<00:03:50.050> my

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:50.200 
that if I don't have makeup on I wash my

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:51.870 
that if I don't have makeup on I wash my
face<00:03:50.230> twice<00:03:50.440> and<00:03:51.100> you<00:03:51.190> still<00:03:51.370> only<00:03:51.550> wash<00:03:51.700> it

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:51.880 
face twice and you still only wash it

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.360 
face twice and you still only wash it
once<00:03:52.120> and<00:03:52.330> that<00:03:52.420> probably<00:03:52.959> had<00:03:53.620> a<00:03:53.650> lot<00:03:53.920> to<00:03:54.190> do

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:54.370 
once and that probably had a lot to do

00:03:54.370 --> 00:03:57.360 
once and that probably had a lot to do
with<00:03:54.580> my<00:03:54.760> acne<00:03:55.180> but<00:03:55.720> if<00:03:56.380> I'm<00:03:56.590> wearing<00:03:56.770> makeup<00:03:56.980> I

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370 
with my acne but if I'm wearing makeup I

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:00.150 
with my acne but if I'm wearing makeup I
will<00:03:57.430> wash<00:03:57.850> it<00:03:58.020> twice<00:03:59.020> those<00:03:59.350> three<00:03:59.560> pumps<00:03:59.860> and

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:00.160 
will wash it twice those three pumps and

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:03.210 
will wash it twice those three pumps and
then<00:04:00.340> three<00:04:00.580> bumps<00:04:00.760> again<00:04:01.090> afterwards<00:04:01.959> now<00:04:02.709> my
