there<00:02:18.670> you're<00:02:18.850> gonna<00:02:18.940> put<00:02:19.709> Java<00:02:20.709> homes<00:02:21.040> both

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
there you're gonna put Java homes both

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.370 
there you're gonna put Java homes both
just<00:02:21.670> like<00:02:21.820> that<00:02:22.060> all<00:02:22.239> caps<00:02:22.510> underscore<00:02:23.170> and

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:25.720 
then put the path to the JRE which

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.630 
then put the path to the JRE which
should<00:02:26.230> be<00:02:26.410> this<00:02:26.560> you<00:02:26.860> can<00:02:27.010> try<00:02:27.130> this<00:02:27.220> and<00:02:27.519> see

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
should be this you can try this and see

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.430 
should be this you can try this and see
if<00:02:27.700> it<00:02:27.790> works<00:02:27.970> if<00:02:28.750> it<00:02:28.840> doesn't<00:02:28.900> you<00:02:29.200> need<00:02:29.320> to

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
if it works if it doesn't you need to

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.759 
if it works if it doesn't you need to
just<00:02:29.590> find<00:02:29.829> it<00:02:30.100> so<00:02:30.370> for<00:02:30.880> me<00:02:31.030> and<00:02:31.180> with<00:02:31.299> see

install those drivers at this point
we're<00:04:33.620> gonna<00:04:33.680> plug<00:04:34.039> the<00:04:34.520> device<00:04:34.789> in<00:04:35.030> via<00:04:35.330> USB

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:35.660 
we're gonna plug the device in via USB

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:40.210 
we're gonna plug the device in via USB
and<00:04:36.970> then<00:04:37.970> we're<00:04:38.120> gonna<00:04:38.210> type<00:04:38.450> AV<00:04:38.720> devices<00:04:39.220> and

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:40.220 
and then we're gonna type AV devices and

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:41.890 
and then we're gonna type AV devices and
if<00:04:40.760> you<00:04:40.820> have<00:04:40.940> a<00:04:41.000> serial<00:04:41.330> number<00:04:41.360> come<00:04:41.660> up<00:04:41.720> like

00:04:41.890 --> 00:04:41.900 
if you have a serial number come up like

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:43.060 
if you have a serial number come up like
that<00:04:42.020> that<00:04:42.080> means<00:04:42.350> your<00:04:42.590> drivers<00:04:42.979> are

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:43.070 
that that means your drivers are

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:44.529 
that that means your drivers are
installed<00:04:43.190> properly<00:04:43.430> we<00:04:43.940> can<00:04:43.970> continue<00:04:44.330> if

00:04:44.529 --> 00:04:44.539 
installed properly we can continue if

00:04:44.539 --> 00:04:46.270 
installed properly we can continue if
you<00:04:44.570> get<00:04:44.810> a<00:04:44.840> blank<00:04:45.139> space<00:04:45.410> on<00:04:45.620> her<00:04:45.740> listed<00:04:46.100> a

you get a blank space on her listed a

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:49.029 
you get a blank space on her listed a
list<00:04:46.610> of<00:04:46.729> devices<00:04:46.970> attached<00:04:47.389> then<00:04:48.050> you<00:04:48.710> might

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:01.070 
you do right click it update the driver

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:03.279 
you do right click it update the driver
software<00:05:01.400> browse<00:05:01.910> pick<00:05:02.600> from<00:05:02.750> a<00:05:02.870> list<00:05:02.900> and

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:04.970 
then find the adb interface it might

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:07.480 
then find the adb interface it might
even<00:05:05.030> be<00:05:05.150> Android<00:05:05.479> interface<00:05:06.010> click<00:05:07.010> Next

even be Android interface click Next

00:05:07.490 --> 00:05:11.640 
even be Android interface click Next
make<00:05:07.970> sure<00:05:08.120> it's<00:05:08.270> Google<00:05:08.660> click<00:05:09.110> Next<00:05:09.880> yes<00:05:10.880> and

make sure it's Google click Next yes and

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:14.260 
make sure it's Google click Next yes and
now<00:05:12.650> it<00:05:13.070> should<00:05:13.220> show<00:05:13.430> up<00:05:13.520> with<00:05:13.610> a<00:05:13.700> TB<00:05:13.910> testing

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:14.270 
now it should show up with a TB testing

00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:16.000 
now it should show up with a TB testing
interface<00:05:14.630> this<00:05:15.260> might<00:05:15.500> also<00:05:15.650> happen

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:16.010 
interface this might also happen

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:17.950 
interface this might also happen
whenever<00:05:16.160> you<00:05:16.310> have<00:05:16.400> fastboot<00:05:16.970> mode<00:05:17.030> as<00:05:17.539> well

you go back to the device manager check

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:26.469 
you go back to the device manager check

as the drivers so that it fixes that and

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:36.580 
as the drivers so that it fixes that and
then<00:05:34.220> try<00:05:34.550> this<00:05:34.760> step<00:05:35.000> again<00:05:35.300> now<00:05:36.020> if<00:05:36.140> you<00:05:36.230> did

then try this step again now if you did

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:38.230 
then try this step again now if you did
get<00:05:36.830> the<00:05:37.130> serial<00:05:37.460> number<00:05:37.700> whenever<00:05:37.970> you<00:05:38.090> type

00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:38.240 
get the serial number whenever you type

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:40.120

to<00:05:38.300> a<00:05:38.450> DB<00:05:38.660> devices<00:05:39.170> then<00:05:39.680> you're<00:05:39.860> going<00:05:40.040> to

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:40.130 
to a DB devices then you're going to

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:44.050 
to a DB devices then you're going to

drivers<00:05:48.890> hopefully<00:05:49.790> ok<00:05:50.540> then<00:05:50.720> we're<00:05:50.900> gonna

00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:51.020 
drivers hopefully ok then we're gonna

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:56.350

at that point on the device it's going

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:06.760 
at that point on the device it's going
