00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:20.610
 let's make butter muffins 

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:25.400
 and for that we need the 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:25.400
 following 200 grams of flour 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:31.590
 200 grams of sugar 

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:36.150
 200 butter 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:40.700
 four eggs an envelope of yeast radio 

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:40.700
 of the lemon and the trickle of rum 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:49.540
 we started throwing the butter type 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:49.540
 ointment 

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:01.600
 then we throw out the sugar 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.460
 Y 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:19.450
 it mixes well 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.450
 nothing is very strong butter 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.439
 and the eggs are added 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.829
 to then beat with the 

00:01:27.439 --> 00:01:29.829
 mixer 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.450
 we have to beat a lot until we have left 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:38.680
 a whitish cream 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.680
 to beat very well 

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:53.160
 and once we have 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.170
 we have 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:14.680
 we add the lemon zest 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:20.090
 we are going to move 

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:26.010
 but let it be clear 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:35.420
 and then we add the network 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:43.159
 and you have to be moving these moments 

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.430
 that fits us well 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.430
 in leaving it 

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:59.260
 then we are adding the 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:03:01.379
 yeast along with life and mix 

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:01.379
 all 

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:20.140
 once she is showing it almost 

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:24.610
 it is put to heat preheat the oven 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:24.610
 30 minutes 409 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:31.780
 is already operating the dough very well as 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:31.780
 in the veins 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.090
 and then we fill in the 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.640
 paper that I bought from the 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:45.150
 muffins and we put them in these molds 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:48.330
 stainless steel because this way the 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:50.930
 they help to raise more they fill the envelope 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:50.930
 half more 

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:56.140
 Y 

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:01.030
 and now I give him a little sugar 

00:03:59.409 --> 00:04:04.840
 above to make it golden is that 

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:07.989
 are very good so well expected 

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:11.290
 and then they are baked for 15 minutes and 

00:04:07.989 --> 00:04:14.500
 they go down to 180 once they are 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:17.440
 brown the tasty beak with a 

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:20.019
 knife and if there is the oven door and 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:22.780
 if you do not take them 

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:24.639
 the cupcakes make them that do not 

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:27.150
 They make them regret they are 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:27.150
 delicious
