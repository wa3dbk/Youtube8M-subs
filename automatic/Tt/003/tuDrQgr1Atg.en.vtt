00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:17.960
 the country on these mojang actions and 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:20.189
 what this performance was called by mojo 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:22.380
 That's why this week comes a bit 

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:25.109
 earlier on Tuesday unexpectedly the 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:27.539

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:38.820
 couple of new updates little new blogs 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:41.579
 In any case , the mobs can take that series 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.410
 now other pug ride in principle 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.820
 the spider is such a rider where the 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:46.079
 skeletons ever had and it now 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.120
 can the spider for example or 

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.980
 turn it off and again higher 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.070
 it high stack came I certainly will 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:58.109
 that works with nbt tag editor or videos 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:59.340
 is called program and so yes so can 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:01.140
 you can set that somehow 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.619
 prisoner he brings so determined yet 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:08.869

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.450
 Look like these bugs when you are there 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.090
 now from a krad of attracting foreign 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:20.400
 play again and then comes in yes 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.590
 earlier so that you no longer sat in it 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.640
 We have now seen 

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.590
 my card disappears completely when 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.530
 there would be no lure and he still in there 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.150
 that means that will be with you then 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.009
 saved with the lockout somehow in 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:35.250
 his data 

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:40.070
 and why will not it be done manually 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:43.259
 day please animated blocks you can like 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:44.030
 you see, you need a config now 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:46.799
 have file 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.570
 So he has my texture pack now 

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:50.340
 no config file in it like most 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.509
 others too and that's why it stands here 

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.420
 bit of texture though that 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:56.969
 then we were still animated 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:00.240
 a small bug in the texter packages 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:02.939
 until shows namely takes textile 

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.040
 from the texture pack but something customer 

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:07.380
 The Federal Army must be the woman from the 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:10.619
 bild crÃªpes no idea what's going on 

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.350

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.540
 again the update 

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:17.170
 For example , the new blocks are now called 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:19.900
 here daylight sensor because the dropper 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:22.480
 Now in German throwers and what is called 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:27.250
 Tnt lore funnel lore 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:28.720
 then after the judge of course the 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.910
 rescue comparators this time in german 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:34.390
 written with k and here also the 

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:37.150
 redstone blog what is missing exactly 

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:40.000
 the hna de fonds the in texture pack 

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:42.280
 expenses are like for example the 

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:45.790
 work now synonymous without mz eja 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:47.250
 test before that it was so that the 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:51.040
 standard things had in it 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:54.070
 and last but not least there is 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:56.260
 now here in graphics settings soft 

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:58.180
 lighting the possibility maximum 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.500
 maximum is this new lightnings 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.500
 system where is he now in the last 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:04.690
 have incorporated time is again like 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:07.500
 that looked beta where those weird 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:11.140
 color differences are on each block 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:13.960
 minimum is the old system of 147 and 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:15.910
 Before that, we'll have a look this week 

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:18.030
 again like last week after that if with 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:22.930
 The staircase was fixed with the stairs 

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:24.730
 and let's fix it to yes nothing 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:28.540
 there is still nothing in here 

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:30.580
 can actually do that too 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.990
 Victims expect King to be chosen 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:37.420

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:39.280
 doors oh think so well that it is in 

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:42.730
