00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:15.320

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:17.210

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:19.610
 fitur the characteristic that best suits you 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:22.039
 interested in trying this in this 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:24.289
 then stand at this stand for sure 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:25.820
 I want to see the new weapons first 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:27.360
 because they are the thing that interests me 

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:31.130
 more and more 

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.130
 and I'm curious about the game anyway 

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:36.940
 and something changed something new and 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:38.260
 if it deserves the purchase it says a moment that 

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:39.879
 what do you expect from this new black 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.190
 ops 

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:44.110
 the best zombie mode a mode 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:46.600
 my zombie's though guys be this one 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:48.010
 interesting answer what you don't 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.589
 liked the old zombie mode 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:53.350
 not in all campaigns all marquees 

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:56.170
 the maps were kind of so-called 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:58.269
 easter eggs that were below 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:00.460
 campaigns inside the map is instead in 

00:00:58.269 --> 00:01:01.510
 new throat will be announced 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:03.370
 that will be real 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:05.890
 multiple multiplayer campaigns 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:07.810
 we hope he is willing to buy it 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:10.960
 you already have some ideas 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:13.030
 I wanted to wait a little while 

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:16.179
 to see some videos on youtube e 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:20.870
 then you buy it immediately to wait a 

00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:22.700
 little or two employees 

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:24.050
 ok guys we managed to stop 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:25.370
 out of the output of black ops 2 

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.320
 directly a clan 

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:32.470
 so first of all ask for your names 

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:32.470
 and around is naked michael 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:39.549
 then we are 91 show them all 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:41.590
 turn around great girls then 

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:43.899
 then you have tried black ops 2 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:45.430
 first of all let's see what they are 

00:01:43.899 --> 00:01:47.950
 let's say your impressions 

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:50.259
 what did you expect what you saw is 

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:52.360
 cute although very similar mv 3 

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:54.430
 surely the maps are better 

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:55.869
 this liked the maps so it is 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:58.479
 instead you liked the ways 

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:00.430
 mode you have played is a little 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:03.070
 difficult to understand myself being a 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:06.100
 player of cod for years, however, by the 

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:08.170
 found this more than satisfactory 

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.700
 I really enjoyed the game 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.010
 you have done more than one game 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:14.049
 We only have one game as soon as we enter 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.220

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:19.989

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:35.970

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.250

 and how old you are 10 10 so that 

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:23.580
 what do you expect from this new black 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:26.330
 ops there is that it would be very beautiful 

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:29.800
 it's beautiful 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:29.800
 it's more violent 

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:34.990
 but instead we say the characteristic that 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:38.380
 more favorites you want to try 

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:41.520
 when you also enter the stand here 

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.520

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:50.760
 the graphics don't know what to shoot too is 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:51.480

 bomb 

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.239

 so he would n't buy it this year 

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:10.910

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:13.640

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:14.690

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:17.239
