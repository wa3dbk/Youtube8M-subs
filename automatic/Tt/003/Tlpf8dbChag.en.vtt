00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:15.030
 Hello and welcome today 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:18.660
 a champion spotlight from like sandra 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.320
 like a switch from the pc server today 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.120
 come out 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.260
 on the testserver and I thought we were 

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:24.119
 bring them directly to me 

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:26.789
 accompanies today the Swiss here too 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.490
 see and I'll show you the first 

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:32.300
 emus and then we come to the spreads 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.300
 see you then 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.829
 then commercial space and there would be 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.329
 first the passive Eisborn and that is 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:08.159
 which is similar to what happened now and 

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:10.440
 Although it gets every time a free 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:12.900
 free game of you canada costs 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.430
 18 seconds and this cologne part 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.869
 will stop for a second 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.970
 decreased if you for example 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:21.030
 somehow cc on the opponent has effect 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.430
 or so and then just had a twelve 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:26.880
 free because the x costs really extreme 

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:29.130
 above all we spam on it at first 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:32.899
 and that will make it a bit 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:35.670
 Dodged the cow is not the right now 

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:38.130
 strong rage hurled honestly 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:41.369
 has like an icicle forward and 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:42.479
 again meets the opponent then solves 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:47.460
 he joins many smaller ones 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:49.340
 and makes us stop for 50 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:54.090
 cent now at level 4 the first 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:55.679
 Indirectly you can see it after he 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.640
 he has met the Swiss 

00:01:55.679 --> 00:02:00.210
 bw is to many smaller parts 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:04.140
 sandra around 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:06.500
 bring en france is the trick 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:10.709
 also magic harm skeleton with 0.6 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:13.250
 and ruth still hold your opponents for 10 

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.250
 seconds fixed 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.320
 and I find that very interesting 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.940
 Here is a bit bigger than human 

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:24.750
 The cow also suffers magical damage 

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:26.160
 when she meets the enemy and the 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.260
 shoots you a claw forward will 

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.910
 See her soon and when you get up 

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.250
 the way to the goal activated again 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.240
 quickly you can porten that 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.200
 I'm also about to turn 

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:40.860
 tested that is really cool actually 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:43.200
 again very cool ag is with the wheel 

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.640
 a bit problematic but new find 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.570
 I'm pretty blatant as an escape 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.950
 pretty good the multi lets itself once 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:52.260
 on the opponents and once on me 

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:56.300
 box yourself and if you are the 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:59.250
 opponent checkout then please the opponents 

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:01.050
 half distance and express martin damage 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:04.410
 and so tells opponents around the opponent around 

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:06.209
 still you will see and will soon 

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:08.610
 casts himself often will stop her 

00:03:06.209 --> 00:03:10.050
 a katie for 1.5 seconds now 

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.120
 It is incumbent on them to know that more is possible 

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:13.470
 but in any case you can not 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:17.160
 be clicked as well as fitz on his 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:19.920
 I'm cool and cool 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:21.690
 show yourself first on the swiss and 

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.350
 Here you can also see the range directly 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:27.300
 then into the lot the next opponents 

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:29.760
 and then make short cut and 

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:32.900
 show you then with me 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.900
 what it looks like then 

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:40.960
 so now in the cut and we see as 

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:42.880
 120 seconds so again and me 

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:45.280
 wanted to show you how it looks like 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:45.850
 that ye job they themselves and the costs 

00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:52.720
 It is really easy 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:56.320
 he just has that cool and has 

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:59.440
 this content also holds the effect 

00:03:56.320 --> 00:04:01.930
 opponent then I'll show you the 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:03.130
 port animation and then I hope 

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:05.080
 that we meet again next time 

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:07.410
 so I say goodbye and until the 

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:07.410
 next time
