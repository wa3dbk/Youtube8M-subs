 daddy's ball 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:50.390
 it is the book helmi mujinga is kernel 

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:51.890
 fell and one two is at the heart 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.800
 from the valley of the Marne in the cradle 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:58.839
 pinot meunier and we're in the middle of 

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.839
 triangle reims epernay castle hold 

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:09.890
 in the family we work the 

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:12.229
 vine and the earth since 1750 in 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.869
 winemaker from father to son since nine 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:18.410
 generations and that's in 1923 that my 

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:19.610
 great grandfather eugene decided to 

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:20.090
 vinify his first bottle of 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:21.860
 Champagne 

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:24.890
 he was a little tired of the prices 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:27.410
 fluctuating grape kind life it's me 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:30.200
 who always makes wine with my father 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:40.610
 besides, the wines that are in big 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:42.170
 proportion of Pinot Meunier with 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:43.550
 level of work of the vine like you 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.289
 can see all our cities 

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:46.940
 are budding and and then in fact one 

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:48.770
 works the soil under laurent what 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.660
 lets us not at all anymore m 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.729
 weeding we also work a small 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:55.940
 little about fermentation additions 

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:57.649
 of nettle decoction of horsetail 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.420
 things a little bit stimulating for the 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:01.009
 vine to simply reinforce its 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:03.770
 natural defenses must be used 

00:02:01.009 --> 00:02:06.729
 a little bit these systems that are a 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.729
 not very close to homeopathy 

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:16.130
 for example with this plant lapresle 

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:19.270
 We're going to have 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:22.610
 thanks to this plant an ability to 

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:24.800
 make our vineyards more and more 

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.780
 then also an anti feature 

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.010
 fungal that is going to be extremely 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.700
 interesting for example to fight 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.400
 against mildew 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:32.600
 here we have nettles it's a fertilizer 

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.070
 foliage which is extremely 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.620
 interesting for the plant its towns and 

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:40.070
 different trace elements of azov 

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:42.140
 kinds it's very beneficial and that by 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:44.510
 example it is comfrey comfrey 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:47.150
 she will see when we make them 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:49.220
 herbal teas interesting properties 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:52.450
 to fight against all kinds 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.450
 insects of life 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:07.120
 daddy's ball 

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:09.549
 by your skin at the start 

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.680
 I leave the principle in fact when we 

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:13.750
 borrows the land from our children and that 

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.909
 whether in the city ​​or in all 

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:18.250
 things we can do and especially a 

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:20.140
 construction like that she has to she 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:22.150
 be as sustainable as possible 

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:24.159
 with the least possible impact on 

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.349
 the environment for that we have it 

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:27.909
 covered photovoltaic panels for 

00:03:26.349 --> 00:03:30.400
 have complete autonomy in 

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:32.019
 electricity we chose to put 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.519
 thermal panels to produce 

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:35.140
 hot water the peculiarity is that 

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:37.360
 we have not air conditioned we have 

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:39.310
 used a Canadian well system 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:42.459
 the principle is simple to bury you 

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:44.440
 in our case 130 meters of pipes to 4 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:46.120
 meters deep and 4 meters from 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:47.799
 deep it is 12 degrees summer like 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.709
 winter you are circulating air to 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:54.310
 inside with just a small 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:04:12.700
 blowing turbine you air conditioned and 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:04:14.109
 2500 cubic meters of cellars one has a 

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:15.970
 local champagne since we are 

00:04:14.109 --> 00:04:17.799
 located in only four villages 

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:19.180
 which are located next to 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:20.139
 others and which are mostly implanted 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.970
 on the same side 

00:04:20.139 --> 00:04:25.630
 so the terroir effect is very important 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:27.669
 at home with so much more 

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:29.919
 pinot miller and in fact we try to 

00:04:27.669 --> 00:04:31.750
 to make the closest to the terroir 

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:34.389
 the most neutral winemaking 

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:36.789
 possible in stainless steel vats with 

00:04:34.389 --> 00:04:39.010
 systematic malolactic fermentations 

00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:51.690
 so we really try to have a 

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:54.099
 neutrality offered our wines are deepening 

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:56.229
 the cuvée that I will present to you 

00:04:54.099 --> 00:04:57.910
 it's a vintage that I'm really 

00:04:56.229 --> 00:05:02.110
 very attached because it is the vintage that 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:04.630
 my grandfather created in 1923 and during 

00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:06.820
 70 years in fact there has been only this 

00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:08.500
 wine today we have six cuvées 

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:11.800
 different but this one has not changed 

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:15.099
 so we're still on 80% miller 20% 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:15.250
 pinot black like and there are around 90 

00:05:15.099 --> 00:05:17.830
 years 

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:22.450
 over generations we stayed on 

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:24.099
 the same type of assembly particularity 

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:26.200
 of this champagne is who the fat 

00:05:24.099 --> 00:05:29.110
 proportion of pinot meunier but especially 

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:32.409
 with pinot meunier who in twenty months 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:33.969
 bottles and in fact we had to fruit 

00:05:32.409 --> 00:05:34.570
 fresh roundness and a great 

00:05:33.969 --> 00:05:37.750
 complexity 

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:39.610
 we can even imagine to consume these 

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:41.500
 pubs and gold tradition at the end a report 

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:43.690
 where we are going to be a little bit with the 

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:46.060
 palate fatigue and complexity and the 

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:48.280
 fruity and the punch of this wine goes 

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:52.139
 to be able to wake up your taste buds 

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:52.139
 in a long gastronomic day 

00:05:55.700 --> 00:06:06.460
 daddy's ball shares with the authorities by 

00:06:03.009 --> 00:06:09.460
 this vintage is a vintage 2006 so 

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:11.439
 special club and especially 100% miller 

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:13.300
 it's true that in 2005 when we 

00:06:11.439 --> 00:06:16.839
 had the chance to go back to the treasure club 

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:20.080
 we proposed to create a vintage 

00:06:16.839 --> 00:06:21.629
 100% special sucker club what has been 

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:24.159
 also a way to meet a challenge 

00:06:21.629 --> 00:06:26.439
 since even at home we had 

00:06:24.159 --> 00:06:30.430
 never made a 100% made a freshness 

00:06:26.439 --> 00:06:32.469
 sounded an extremely fine bubble of 

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:35.589
 aromas of white fruits one is one is 

00:06:32.469 --> 00:06:39.009
 really about fishing with a 

00:06:35.589 --> 00:06:41.860
 long we are we are sure 

00:06:39.009 --> 00:06:47.009
 on extremely intense aromas that 

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:47.009
 remains in the mouth several tens
