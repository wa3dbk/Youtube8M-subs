we<00:02:13.500> clean<00:02:13.739> their<00:02:13.950> pin<00:02:14.270> as<00:02:15.270> needed<00:02:15.870> usually

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:16.650 
we clean their pin as needed usually

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.370 
we clean their pin as needed usually
about<00:02:17.069> every<00:02:17.400> week<00:02:17.819> or<00:02:18.030> two<00:02:18.209> we<00:02:18.989> just<00:02:19.170> cleaned

about every week or two we just cleaned
it<00:02:19.470> recently<00:02:19.860> and<00:02:20.010> you<00:02:20.130> can<00:02:20.280> see<00:02:20.400> they<00:02:20.640> tend<00:02:20.940> to

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:21.000 
it recently and you can see they tend to

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.930 
it recently and you can see they tend to
waste<00:02:21.209> some<00:02:21.390> hay<00:02:22.280> but<00:02:23.280> it's<00:02:23.520> important<00:02:23.910> that
