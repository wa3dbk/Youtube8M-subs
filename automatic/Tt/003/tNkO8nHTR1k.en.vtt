00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:43.520
 how we bent 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:55.250

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:50.860
 neither here nor here he goin in this and 

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:54.169
 secret 

00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:55.629
 now we need our ends unbend in 

00:04:54.169 --> 00:04:58.960
 different sides 

00:04:55.629 --> 00:04:58.960
 for this 

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:13.680
 we will steam in pairs 

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:19.230
 edges to one side and the other 

00:05:24.289 --> 00:05:34.970

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:49.880
 transfer and shove inward until 

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:00.880

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:07.150
 walk 

00:06:32.469 --> 00:06:38.870

00:06:36.919 --> 00:06:43.639
 nowhere he fastened 

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:50.169

00:06:43.639 --> 00:06:53.169
 side for this we are with fire not here but 

00:06:50.169 --> 00:06:53.169
 vice versa 

00:06:58.849 --> 00:07:14.169
 and let us bend though the right side 

00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:28.620
