00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:09.050
 Manufacturer LG also makes its own 

00:00:06.549 --> 00:00:11.120
 accessories and one of those accessories 

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:12.980
 I actually hang around their neck here 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:14.060
 and I obviously after in the box 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:16.219
 my hands 

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:18.199
 so the lg shows ultra and the lg shows 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:20.720
 ultra is a bluetooth stereo headset 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:22.099
 with active noise cancellation 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.140
 and basically what you meant for the 

00:00:22.099 --> 00:00:25.579
 athlete well remember as kitchen 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.470
 so my running it extra 

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:29.480
 interesting and recently i got it 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.039
 extensively tested and this video that four 

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:32.570
 of the lg shows ultra 

00:00:31.039 --> 00:00:34.280
 have your experience tell with this 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.530
 lg headset 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.510
 the lg tono prices the successor to lg 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.309
 tooth plus the every show plus was one 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.170
 interesting device an advantage of 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:44.000
 This device is that he has a few others 

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.949
 give extra functions 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.449
 First of all noise cancellation what this 

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:48.920
 he is doing it when you turn it on in the 

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:50.510
 case a twitter two buttons on and 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.370
 it will turn it on and you eat me 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.870
 noise cancellation on the white is that 

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:54.890
 he the noise cancellation 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:56.600
 as soon as that said he 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.179
 ambient noise to a certain level 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.440
 philtrum in practice 

00:00:59.179 --> 00:01:02.179
 we think it reasonable but not special 

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.109
 well i also got it tested in it 

00:01:02.179 --> 00:01:05.540
 can do better 

00:01:03.109 --> 00:01:06.619
 especially Sony and Angry can do this better 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.329
 then lg 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:10.040
 apparently but nevertheless it is handy 

00:01:08.329 --> 00:01:11.960
 under dream has going to be one 

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.610
 certain level a reasonable filters out 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.049
 but in airplanes or a very busy one 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.880
 environment does not have that much for so long 

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:19.100
 and would have many more and with one 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.200
 headset were the whole or shovel 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.119
 which also has a microphone in it 

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:24.979
 the pinna better than it 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:26.329
 can filter out ambient noise 

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:28.130
 in other words, an airplane is not that often 

00:01:26.329 --> 00:01:30.229
 but never the living in san there 

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.820
 something with which to run because he is the 

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:33.530
 filters out ambient noise to a 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.600
 at a certain level, the music does something 

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.100
 better justice 

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.990
 if it is on what on this headset is that 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.219
 He has been with such a unique design 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.780
 in two ways 

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:43.579
 actually you just got it that way 

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.049
 must say to hang around your neck like this 

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:46.729
 and there you can do a little bit in the 

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:48.890
 headset and you just throw it in your ear 

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:50.810
 it works out fine without 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:52.280
 little pina month it was okay 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.840
 between dirk kuyt magnesia in the back 

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.549
 which would actually put you right in 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.570
 have to click if i am a bit in the 

00:01:55.549 --> 00:01:58.550
 keeps it close 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.229
 therefore the ears and continues ned was 

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:01.550
 stay nice and hang when I am mine 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:03.229
 the right way in it as it does now 

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:04.250
 and that in itself is useful 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:06.410
 thought out 

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:08.000
 the ever shell 4 judging the best good 

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:09.709
 and is several blocks or contributor 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.540
 the she already rams for hiro and she 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:13.280
 in a your headset you have to be close 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.140
 I myself find other people every day 

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.600
 so again less pleasant that is 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.280
 marry a little more than continue 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.600
 watch the the the the self the the 

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.490
 top of the transmits in a number 

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.080
 record buttons ' to hang on the 

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:26.300
 volume button and side 

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.130
 on and off button and notions this button and 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.810
 In addition, we also find an entrance 

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:32.239
 to charge the device 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:33.830
 according to lg the device goes about 10 hours 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:35.120
 on a single load 

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:37.010
 if you turn on noise cancellation 

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:38.060
 about 8 hours in practice with us 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:39.040
 knees about sunning noise 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.510
 cancellation 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:43.130
 7018 and with noise cancellation 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.780
 about five to six hours 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:46.280
 doing fine and asking of course 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.450
 how long such as the district 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:49.489
 used for you to load 

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:50.900
 throws but a plane can do that 

00:02:49.489 --> 00:02:52.489
 They are awkward so you need him 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.640
 particularly large battery 

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:57.410
 on finger now no disadvantage he who 

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:59.480
 you have to love his self 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.280
 actually and and got used to it and 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.810
 myself in the not so pleasant during 

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:04.220
 running something on my shoulders too 

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:04.940
 and because all the time up and down 

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.700
 is going 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:09.350
 if I jump once you would see 

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.150
 that it will be relatively fast 

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:13.040
 and again that's the ears and then 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:14.090
 thing to a fireplace template engineer 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:15.410
 times jogging 

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:17.150
 then me just that service he did 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:18.440
 year shoulder blades to fold 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.180
 I personally think that not so pleasant it 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:22.340
 seems to me I just really want 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:24.380
 can effortlessly go modern without things 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:25.519
 distract me, I was very much with 

00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:27.079
 because if we have something personal it is 

00:03:25.519 --> 00:03:29.209
 I will not like myself 

00:03:27.079 --> 00:03:31.220
 nice to have something in my ears 

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:32.870
 have a drawstring and at the back 

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:34.790
 the other forms middle that not one 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:36.290
 In other words, it quickly became irritated 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:37.820
 because if something but if you go ahead 

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:39.650
 walking or sitting still than he is 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:41.840
 terms school team on your shoulders he is 

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:43.910
 nothing true is that vic also big advantage 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.620
 the battery sony heavy the whole thing like that 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:47.750
 true that they are certainly handy 

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:48.950
 it is reasonably watertight so that we 

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:51.709
 if you start sweating it is natural 

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:52.910
 also handy that shield and then 

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:54.200
 something important and that of course 

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:56.030
 the sound quality 

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:57.200
 lg has entered into a partnership with jbl 

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:59.630
 and diego always of course reasonable 

00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:01.070
 known for its sound quality and the 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:02.000
 ever you like this device and therefore best 

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:04.130
 just fine 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.110
 quality disappoints me a bit 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:07.730
 I find that low tones do not belong to one 

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:09.410
 good their right come from the bass of you 

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:12.290
 they don't really fall for a bunch 

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:13.370
 in the treble are reasonable to good 

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:15.110
 but here again I have another 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:17.209
 doctors, for example, year of a lady portrait 

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:19.579
 the better sound there also falls 

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:21.350
 the volume of the mine against i had 

00:04:19.579 --> 00:04:22.700
 he shot me there might be something wrong 

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:24.260
 than average but I did 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:27.230
 hoped he will come out a little harder 

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:29.420
 and that she was therefore not the case and 

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:30.980
 friends all disadvantage advantage for it 

00:04:29.420 --> 00:04:32.660
 device sometimes he needs any blood 

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:34.370
 the urban device works from almost 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:36.230
 any modern android smartphone up to 

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:38.060
 iphone and shows windows phone 

00:04:36.230 --> 00:04:39.830
 and so work with everything and so he is 

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:41.810
 compatible with everything 

00:04:39.830 --> 00:04:43.730
 then push the price I just have to 

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:47.150
 googling finally found for 

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:47.960
 125 euros online this it the lg 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:50.030
 show 

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:51.980
 ultra and look is quite reasonable 

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:54.380
 price but still think he 

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:56.540
 master of schiphol van because ship falls 

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:58.280
 because he actually misses doing a little 

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:00.760
 the box is very large and behind it 

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:03.140
 pictured to run I don't find any 

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:05.300
 more pleasant and headset because you are so handsome 

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:06.979
 flying around my shoulders is possible 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:08.750
 from this setback but for normal 

00:05:06.979 --> 00:05:10.100
 use something for work then 

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:11.030
 for example , one is more than fine 

00:05:10.100 --> 00:05:13.610
 headset 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:15.080
 such a big event so it is just 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:17.000
 nevertheless, you are again an advantage 

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:19.250
 that is that you can operate that night 

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:22.360
 all in all for days at fine but not 

00:05:19.250 --> 00:05:22.360
 so much to run what I find
