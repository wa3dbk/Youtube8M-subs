00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:01.910 

so<00:00:00.420> today<00:00:00.719> I<00:00:00.750> removed<00:00:01.140> the<00:00:01.290> video<00:00:01.589> that<00:00:01.890> I

00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:01.920 
so today I removed the video that I

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.249 
so today I removed the video that I
uploaded<00:00:02.399> yesterday<00:00:03.090> and<00:00:03.360> apparently<00:00:04.140> it

00:00:04.249 --> 00:00:04.259 
uploaded yesterday and apparently it

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:06.710 
uploaded yesterday and apparently it
included<00:00:04.830> a<00:00:04.920> lot<00:00:05.069> of<00:00:05.100> false<00:00:05.700> information

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
included a lot of false information

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.470 
included a lot of false information
so<00:00:07.170> I<00:00:07.529> thought<00:00:07.830> that<00:00:07.890> runescape<00:00:08.670> 3<00:00:09.000> is<00:00:09.210> going

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:09.480 
so I thought that runescape 3 is going

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.200 
so I thought that runescape 3 is going
to<00:00:09.630> be<00:00:09.750> the<00:00:09.900> least<00:00:10.110> with<00:00:10.559> HTML<00:00:11.340> 5<00:00:11.370> which

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
to be the least with HTML 5 which

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.089 
to be the least with HTML 5 which
apparently<00:00:12.540> is<00:00:12.870> not<00:00:13.080> the<00:00:13.230> case<00:00:13.469> and<00:00:13.769> they<00:00:14.009> are

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:14.099 
apparently is not the case and they are

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:17.599 
apparently is not the case and they are
still<00:00:14.400> going<00:00:14.639> to<00:00:14.820> keep<00:00:14.969> HTML<00:00:15.660> 5<00:00:15.960> in<00:00:16.289> beta<00:00:17.010> for

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
still going to keep HTML 5 in beta for

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.480 
still going to keep HTML 5 in beta for
at<00:00:17.789> least<00:00:18.029> a<00:00:18.270> few<00:00:18.570> more<00:00:18.810> months<00:00:19.050> I<00:00:19.490> thought

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
at least a few more months I thought

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.370 
at least a few more months I thought
that<00:00:20.640> the<00:00:20.730> runescape<00:00:20.970> 3<00:00:21.090> was<00:00:21.449> all<00:00:21.630> about<00:00:21.840> HTML

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
that the runescape 3 was all about HTML

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.099 
that the runescape 3 was all about HTML
5<00:00:22.619> though<00:00:22.920> you<00:00:23.400> know<00:00:23.939> the<00:00:24.119> advertiser<00:00:24.720> has

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
5 though you know the advertiser has

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.859 
5 though you know the advertiser has
like<00:00:25.619> the<00:00:26.310> new<00:00:26.460> graphics<00:00:27.029> the<00:00:27.420> bigger<00:00:27.750> the

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
like the new graphics the bigger the

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.200 
like the new graphics the bigger the
view<00:00:28.080> distance<00:00:28.320> and<00:00:28.769> all<00:00:28.890> that<00:00:29.130> and<00:00:29.429> it's<00:00:30.029> like

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
view distance and all that and it's like

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.630 
view distance and all that and it's like
yeah<00:00:30.539> so<00:00:30.750> finally<00:00:31.230> it's<00:00:31.349> here<00:00:31.590> but<00:00:31.920> you're<00:00:32.460> not

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
yeah so finally it's here but you're not

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.580 
yeah so finally it's here but you're not
getting<00:00:33.030> the<00:00:33.120> graphics<00:00:33.600> just<00:00:33.690> yet<00:00:34.140> and<00:00:34.440> you're

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
getting the graphics just yet and you're

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.560 
getting the graphics just yet and you're
not<00:00:34.770> getting<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.219> view<00:00:35.399> distance<00:00:35.640> yet<00:00:36.090> the

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:36.570 
not getting the view distance yet the

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.420 
not getting the view distance yet the
only<00:00:36.690> thing<00:00:36.960> you're<00:00:37.110> getting<00:00:37.469> now<00:00:37.620> is<00:00:37.860> the<00:00:38.100> new

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:38.430 
only thing you're getting now is the new

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.240 
only thing you're getting now is the new
interface<00:00:38.820> system<00:00:39.510> and<00:00:39.780> that's<00:00:40.469> about<00:00:40.649> it<00:00:40.980> so

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:41.250 
interface system and that's about it so

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.700 
interface system and that's about it so
my<00:00:41.550> eyes<00:00:41.790> is<00:00:42.149> like<00:00:42.180> not<00:00:42.600> runescape<00:00:43.020> 3<00:00:43.050> really

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:43.710 
my eyes is like not runescape 3 really

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.180 
my eyes is like not runescape 3 really
but<00:00:44.399> it's<00:00:44.550> more<00:00:44.700> like<00:00:44.910> runescape<00:00:45.360> 2.5<00:00:46.020> so<00:00:46.770> just

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
but it's more like runescape 2.5 so just

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.100 
but it's more like runescape 2.5 so just
wanted<00:00:47.520> to<00:00:47.579> clarify<00:00:47.820> that<00:00:48.180> everything<00:00:48.960> that<00:00:49.050> I

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:30.170 
the past and the best item that I got
from<00:01:27.240> elite<00:01:27.720> clue<00:01:27.960> Scrolls<00:01:28.350> was<00:01:28.799> a<00:01:29.189> photo<00:01:29.880> kit

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:30.180 
from elite clue Scrolls was a photo kit

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:33.649 
from elite clue Scrolls was a photo kit
which<00:01:31.110> was<00:01:31.500> 200<00:01:32.430> million<00:01:32.670> at<00:01:32.970> that<00:01:33.150> time<00:01:33.390> it

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
which was 200 million at that time it

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:35.800 
which was 200 million at that time it
was<00:01:33.840> I<00:01:34.049> remember<00:01:34.200> we<00:01:34.710> didn't<00:01:35.009> even<00:01:35.189> have<00:01:35.310> a

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:35.810 
was I remember we didn't even have a

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:38.870 
was I remember we didn't even have a
free<00:01:36.810> trade<00:01:37.079> at<00:01:37.259> that<00:01:37.439> time<00:01:37.710> so<00:01:38.340> it<00:01:38.400> was<00:01:38.610> very

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
free trade at that time so it was very

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.330 
free trade at that time so it was very
expensive<00:01:39.240> and<00:01:39.780> that<00:01:39.840> was<00:01:40.409> the<00:01:40.560> best<00:01:40.740> drop<00:01:41.070> and

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:41.340 
expensive and that was the best drop and

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.639 
expensive and that was the best drop and
that's<00:01:41.939> it<00:01:42.240> that's<00:01:42.570> pretty<00:01:42.840> much<00:01:43.020> it<00:01:43.290> I<00:01:43.470> don't

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
that's it that's pretty much it I don't

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.800 
that's it that's pretty much it I don't
remember<00:01:43.829> anything<00:01:44.579> getting<00:01:45.149> anything<00:01:45.420> else

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
remember anything getting anything else

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:49.850 
remember anything getting anything else
