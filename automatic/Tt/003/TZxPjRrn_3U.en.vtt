linear taper these are pretty

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:25.220 
linear taper these are pretty
interesting<00:00:23.699> in<00:00:23.910> that<00:00:23.939> they<00:00:24.269> can<00:00:24.449> control<00:00:24.840> ten

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230

everything<00:00:29.730> you<00:00:30.570> just<00:00:30.779> feed<00:00:31.080> it<00:00:31.230> in<00:00:31.320> analog

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
everything you just feed it in analog

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.590 
everything you just feed it in analog
signal<00:00:31.859> it<00:00:32.279> takes<00:00:32.730> that<00:00:32.910> analog<00:00:33.210> signal

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
signal it takes that analog signal

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.840 
signal it takes that analog signal
splits<00:00:33.960> it<00:00:34.110> up<00:00:34.200> into<00:00:34.260> ten<00:00:35.040> different<00:00:35.070> discrete

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
splits it up into ten different discrete

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.479 
splits it up into ten different discrete
LEDs<00:00:36.420> drives<00:00:37.350> those<00:00:37.530> LEDs<00:00:37.980> and<00:00:38.280> you<00:00:38.370> get<00:00:38.460> a

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
LEDs drives those LEDs and you get a

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:40.819 
LEDs drives those LEDs and you get a
really<00:00:38.760> simple<00:00:39.180> way<00:00:39.329> to<00:00:39.390> drive<00:00:40.110> a<00:00:40.379> bar<00:00:40.680> graph

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829

plugged<00:00:51.090> back<00:00:51.329> into<00:00:51.840> our<00:00:52.110> cameras<00:00:52.860> we're<00:00:53.039> just

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
plugged back into our cameras we're just

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.950 
plugged back into our cameras we're just
using<00:00:53.670> the<00:00:53.760> monitor<00:00:54.090> out<00:00:54.270> from<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.629> camera

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
using the monitor out from the camera

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.630 
using the monitor out from the camera
into<00:00:55.230> this<00:00:55.530> and<00:00:55.860> you<00:00:55.980> can<00:00:56.100> see<00:00:56.250> we<00:00:56.370> have<00:00:56.489> no

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
into this and you can see we have no

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.400 
into this and you can see we have no
op-amp<00:00:57.090> no<00:00:57.270> other<00:00:57.449> driver<00:00:57.780> circuit<00:00:58.079> here<00:00:58.379> we

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
op-amp no other driver circuit here we

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.069 
op-amp no other driver circuit here we
just<00:00:58.649> have<00:00:58.859> the<00:00:58.980> analog<00:00:59.340> input<00:00:59.910> directly<00:01:00.899> from

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
just have the analog input directly from

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.969 
just have the analog input directly from
the<00:01:01.260> camera<00:01:01.500> into<00:01:01.949> the<00:01:02.879> four<00:01:03.270> ICS<00:01:04.140> we<00:01:04.799> just

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
the camera into the four ICS we just

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.320 
the camera into the four ICS we just
have<00:01:05.100> a<00:01:05.129> couple<00:01:05.369> of<00:01:05.489> resistors<00:01:05.760> and<00:01:05.970> some

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:06.330 
have a couple of resistors and some

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.510 
have a couple of resistors and some
wiring<00:01:06.540> here<00:01:06.900> but<00:01:07.140> generally<00:01:07.890> speaking<00:01:08.310> all

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:08.520 
wiring here but generally speaking all

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.420 
wiring here but generally speaking all
we're<00:01:08.700> doing<00:01:09.000> is<00:01:09.119> taking<00:01:09.299> the<00:01:09.540> analog<00:01:09.869> input

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:10.430 
we're doing is taking the analog input

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.730 
we're doing is taking the analog input
into<00:01:11.430> the<00:01:11.850> four<00:01:12.180> ICS<00:01:12.840> and<00:01:13.140> then<00:01:13.560> they're

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
into the four ICS and then they're

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.670 
into the four ICS and then they're
connected<00:01:13.890> directly<00:01:14.400> to<00:01:14.930> the<00:01:15.930> LED<00:01:16.229> bar<00:01:16.380> graphs

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
connected directly to the LED bar graphs

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.530 
connected directly to the LED bar graphs
and<00:01:16.920> we<00:01:17.100> get<00:01:17.250> this<00:01:17.400> nice<00:01:17.640> little<00:01:17.880> range<00:01:18.150> here

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
and we get this nice little range here

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.050 
and we get this nice little range here
we<00:01:19.170> have<00:01:19.320> to<00:01:19.590> trim<00:01:20.100> pots<00:01:20.430> that<00:01:20.759> are

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
we have to trim pots that are

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:26.060 
we have to trim pots that are
attenuating<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:21.869> low<00:01:22.290> end<00:01:22.560> as<00:01:24.560> well<00:01:25.560> as<00:01:25.619> the

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
attenuating the low end as well as the

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.340 
attenuating the low end as well as the
high<00:01:26.340> end<00:01:26.369> so<00:01:26.850> we<00:01:26.939> can<00:01:27.119> make<00:01:27.540> it<00:01:27.689> a<00:01:27.869> little<00:01:28.140> bit

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
high end so we can make it a little bit

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.380 
high end so we can make it a little bit
softer<00:01:28.860> or<00:01:28.890> we<00:01:29.250> can<00:01:29.430> make<00:01:29.579> a<00:01:29.610> clip<00:01:29.970> a<00:01:30.150> little

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
softer or we can make a clip a little

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:33.020 
softer or we can make a clip a little
bit<00:01:30.479> quicker<00:01:30.689> so<00:01:31.130> they're<00:01:32.130> pretty<00:01:32.400> easy<00:01:32.640> to

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
bit quicker so they're pretty easy to

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.819 
bit quicker so they're pretty easy to
use<00:01:33.060> and<00:01:33.630> we<00:01:33.689> do<00:01:33.810> have<00:01:33.930> a<00:01:33.990> full<00:01:34.259> QuickStart

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
use and we do have a full QuickStart

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.890 
use and we do have a full QuickStart
guide<00:01:35.009> on<00:01:35.220> how<00:01:35.400> to<00:01:35.430> use<00:01:35.610> these<00:01:36.000> both<00:01:36.600> in<00:01:36.780> a

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:36.900 
guide on how to use these both in a

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:38.960 
guide on how to use these both in a
daisy-chained<00:01:37.590> configuration<00:01:38.400> as<00:01:38.579> well<00:01:38.610> as

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
daisy-chained configuration as well as

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.030 
daisy-chained configuration as well as
individually<00:01:39.659> they<00:01:39.900> also<00:01:40.049> have<00:01:40.320> another<00:01:40.710> mode

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
individually they also have another mode

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.670 
individually they also have another mode
which<00:01:41.520> is<00:01:41.670> called<00:01:41.909> the<00:01:42.090> dot<00:01:42.360> mode<00:01:42.750> which<00:01:43.439> would

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
which is called the dot mode which would

just display one single led so become

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:48.410 
just display one single led so become

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
like a peak meter so it would only show

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.030 
like a peak meter so it would only show
one<00:01:48.659> led<00:01:49.079> at<00:01:49.170> the<00:01:49.229> time<00:01:49.439> it<00:01:49.560> would<00:01:49.710> just<00:01:49.890> show

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
one led at the time it would just show

this<00:03:35.400> is<00:03:35.640> one-inch<00:03:36.030> pipe<00:03:36.540> and<00:03:36.900> the<00:03:37.410> one-inch

00:03:37.850 --> 00:03:37.860 
this is one-inch pipe and the one-inch

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:39.680 
this is one-inch pipe and the one-inch
is<00:03:38.010> actually<00:03:38.400> the<00:03:38.519> inner<00:03:38.790> diameter<00:03:39.239> of<00:03:39.600> the

on the end of the pipe like this and

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.250 
on the end of the pipe like this and
allows<00:03:47.610> you<00:03:47.790> to<00:03:47.970> use<00:03:48.120> PVC<00:03:48.570> pipe<00:03:48.989> as<00:03:49.230> a

of this one base

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:29.720 
of this one base
is<00:04:27.570> like<00:04:27.810> an<00:04:27.930> end<00:04:28.200> clamp<00:04:28.620> where<00:04:29.190> this<00:04:29.340> one<00:04:29.580> is

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:29.730 
is like an end clamp where this one is

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:32.510 
is like an end clamp where this one is
kind<00:04:29.970> of<00:04:30.000> like<00:04:30.150> a<00:04:30.180> side<00:04:30.420> clamp<00:04:30.750> but<00:04:31.280> PVC<00:04:32.280> is

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:32.520 
kind of like a side clamp but PVC is

change<00:05:07.830> the<00:05:08.600> properties<00:05:09.600> of<00:05:09.630> these<00:05:09.870> materials

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:09.980 
change the properties of these materials

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:13.670 
change the properties of these materials
so<00:05:10.980> flex<00:05:11.730> and<00:05:11.910> all<00:05:12.000> is<00:05:12.330> a<00:05:13.050> material<00:05:13.650> that

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:13.680 
so flex and all is a material that

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.160 
so flex and all is a material that
shrinks<00:05:14.520> when<00:05:14.850> you<00:05:14.970> apply<00:05:15.300> heat<00:05:15.600> to<00:05:15.630> it<00:05:16.020> and

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:16.170 
shrinks when you apply heat to it and

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:19.520 
shrinks when you apply heat to it and
that's<00:05:17.070> all<00:05:17.310> it<00:05:17.520> does<00:05:17.870> you<00:05:18.870> have<00:05:19.020> a<00:05:19.050> length<00:05:19.320> of

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:19.530 
that's all it does you have a length of

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:21.470 
that's all it does you have a length of
it<00:05:19.680> when<00:05:20.010> you<00:05:20.160> apply<00:05:20.520> a<00:05:20.550> current<00:05:20.940> to<00:05:21.180> it<00:05:21.210> to

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:21.480 
it when you apply a current to it to

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:23.770 
it when you apply a current to it to
heat<00:05:21.660> it<00:05:21.780> up<00:05:21.870> or<00:05:22.080> even<00:05:22.350> heat<00:05:22.560> it<00:05:22.650> up<00:05:22.800> with<00:05:23.070> say

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:23.780 
heat it up or even heat it up with say

00:05:23.780 --> 00:05:27.500 
heat it up or even heat it up with say
butane<00:05:24.780> lighter<00:05:25.040> it<00:05:26.040> will<00:05:26.070> actually<00:05:26.510> shrink

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:27.510 
butane lighter it will actually shrink

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:30.470 
butane lighter it will actually shrink
down<00:05:27.810> to<00:05:28.230> a<00:05:28.260> shorter<00:05:28.650> length<00:05:28.860> whereas<00:05:29.820> muscle

00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:30.480 
down to a shorter length whereas muscle

00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:33.140 
down to a shorter length whereas muscle
wire<00:05:30.720> doesn't<00:05:31.350> come<00:05:31.800> with<00:05:32.010> any<00:05:32.040> pre<00:05:32.730> trained

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:33.150 
wire doesn't come with any pre trained

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:35.420 
wire doesn't come with any pre trained
action<00:05:33.810> when<00:05:34.020> it<00:05:34.110> heats<00:05:34.350> up<00:05:34.590> if<00:05:34.830> you<00:05:35.250> get<00:05:35.370> a

00:05:35.420 --> 00:05:35.430 
action when it heats up if you get a

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:37.160 
action when it heats up if you get a
piece<00:05:35.610> of<00:05:35.790> muscle<00:05:35.970> wire<00:05:36.300> and<00:05:36.630> you<00:05:36.750> just<00:05:36.960> heat

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:37.170 
piece of muscle wire and you just heat

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:39.200 
piece of muscle wire and you just heat
it<00:05:37.200> up<00:05:37.380> without<00:05:37.770> doing<00:05:38.100> anything<00:05:38.400> to<00:05:38.580> it<00:05:38.730> it

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:39.210 
it up without doing anything to it it

00:05:39.210 --> 00:05:41.720 
it up without doing anything to it it
doesn't<00:05:39.870> move<00:05:40.050> or<00:05:40.470> do<00:05:40.830> anything<00:05:41.220> at<00:05:41.340> all<00:05:41.430> it's

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:41.730 
doesn't move or do anything at all it's

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:43.910 
doesn't move or do anything at all it's
like<00:05:41.880> heating<00:05:42.270> up<00:05:42.390> a<00:05:42.510> piece<00:05:42.720> of<00:05:42.930> jumper<00:05:43.710> wire

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:43.920 
like heating up a piece of jumper wire

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:46.130 
like heating up a piece of jumper wire
so<00:05:44.760> what<00:05:44.940> you<00:05:45.030> need<00:05:45.150> to<00:05:45.210> do<00:05:45.390> to<00:05:45.510> that<00:05:45.660> is<00:05:45.930> to

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:46.140 
so what you need to do to that is to

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:48.380 
so what you need to do to that is to
train<00:05:46.410> it<00:05:46.590> in<00:05:46.740> other<00:05:47.070> words<00:05:47.310> to<00:05:47.520> get<00:05:47.640> it<00:05:47.790> so<00:05:48.090> hot

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:48.390 
train it in other words to get it so hot

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:50.570 
train it in other words to get it so hot
that<00:05:48.720> it<00:05:48.870> actually<00:05:49.260> remembers<00:05:49.830> that<00:05:50.100> state

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:50.580 
that it actually remembers that state

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:53.150 
that it actually remembers that state
that<00:05:50.820> it's<00:05:50.970> in<00:05:51.180> and<00:05:51.480> at<00:05:52.260> that<00:05:52.440> point<00:05:52.740> once

00:05:53.150 --> 00:05:53.160 
that it's in and at that point once

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:55.280 
that it's in and at that point once
you've<00:05:53.430> shaped<00:05:53.760> it<00:05:53.970> heated<00:05:54.480> it<00:05:54.600> way<00:05:54.810> up<00:05:54.840> and

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:55.290 
you've shaped it heated it way up and

00:05:55.290 --> 00:05:57.350 
you've shaped it heated it way up and
then<00:05:55.500> cooled<00:05:55.740> it<00:05:55.860> back<00:05:55.980> down<00:05:56.220> it<00:05:56.550> will<00:05:57.060> try<00:05:57.300> to

00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:57.360 
then cooled it back down it will try to

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:59.600 
then cooled it back down it will try to
get<00:05:57.600> back<00:05:57.810> into<00:05:58.170> that<00:05:58.530> shape<00:05:58.920> when<00:05:59.460> it's

00:05:59.600 --> 00:05:59.610 
get back into that shape when it's

00:05:59.610 --> 00:06:01.160 
get back into that shape when it's
heated<00:05:59.940> again<00:06:00.060> so<00:06:00.540> it<00:06:00.690> doesn't<00:06:00.990> shrink

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:01.170 
heated again so it doesn't shrink

00:06:01.170 --> 00:06:03.410 
heated again so it doesn't shrink
directly<00:06:01.920> the<00:06:02.520> same<00:06:02.670> way<00:06:02.820> flexion<00:06:03.150> all<00:06:03.240> does

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:03.420 
directly the same way flexion all does

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:05.690 
directly the same way flexion all does
it<00:06:03.630> actually<00:06:04.200> deflects<00:06:04.740> to<00:06:04.860> either<00:06:05.010> side<00:06:05.400> like

00:06:05.690 --> 00:06:05.700 
it actually deflects to either side like

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:09.260 
it actually deflects to either side like
coil<00:06:06.150> and<00:06:07.050> pulls<00:06:07.380> itself<00:06:08.010> together<00:06:08.460> the

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:09.270 
coil and pulls itself together the

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:11.660 
coil and pulls itself together the
advantage<00:06:09.780> is<00:06:09.900> a<00:06:09.930> muscle<00:06:10.320> wire<00:06:10.500> or<00:06:10.830> that<00:06:11.370> that

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:11.670 
advantage is a muscle wire or that that

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:14.000 
advantage is a muscle wire or that that
deflection<00:06:12.150> causes<00:06:12.810> there<00:06:12.990> to<00:06:13.110> be<00:06:13.260> a<00:06:13.440> lot<00:06:13.800> of

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:14.010 
deflection causes there to be a lot of

00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:16.280 
deflection causes there to be a lot of
travel<00:06:14.520> when<00:06:15.000> it<00:06:15.180> actually<00:06:15.750> activates

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:16.290 
travel when it actually activates

00:06:16.290 --> 00:06:18.650 
travel when it actually activates
whereas<00:06:17.220> flexion<00:06:17.610> all<00:06:17.730> doesn't<00:06:18.120> have<00:06:18.330> very

00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:18.660 
whereas flexion all doesn't have very

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:20.090 
whereas flexion all doesn't have very
much<00:06:18.840> travel<00:06:19.350> because<00:06:19.530> there's<00:06:19.710> nowhere<00:06:20.040> for

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:20.100 
much travel because there's nowhere for

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:22.580 
much travel because there's nowhere for
the<00:06:20.340> material<00:06:20.760> to<00:06:20.880> really<00:06:21.030> go<00:06:21.390> but<00:06:22.020> it's<00:06:22.140> a<00:06:22.260> lot

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:22.590 
the material to really go but it's a lot

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:24.710 
the material to really go but it's a lot
stronger<00:06:23.190> it<00:06:23.520> pulls<00:06:23.790> with<00:06:23.940> a<00:06:23.970> lot<00:06:24.180> more<00:06:24.360> force

stronger it pulls with a lot more force
than<00:06:25.530> muscle<00:06:25.950> wired<00:06:26.160> will<00:06:26.550> start<00:06:26.820> by

than muscle wired will start by

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:28.640 
than muscle wired will start by
connecting<00:06:27.180> the<00:06:27.450> muscle<00:06:27.870> wire<00:06:28.050> what<00:06:28.530> I'm

connecting the muscle wire what I'm
going<00:06:28.860> to<00:06:28.890> do<00:06:29.100> is<00:06:29.340> just<00:06:29.580> turn<00:06:29.910> on<00:06:30.210> the<00:06:30.240> voltage

00:06:30.830 --> 00:06:30.840 
going to do is just turn on the voltage

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:33.170 
going to do is just turn on the voltage
source<00:06:31.170> and<00:06:31.470> this<00:06:32.280> wire<00:06:32.550> will<00:06:32.790> heat<00:06:33.000> up<00:06:33.030> and

source and this wire will heat up and
you'll<00:06:33.510> see<00:06:33.750> this<00:06:33.930> little<00:06:33.990> muscle<00:06:34.530> wire<00:06:34.710> arm

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:35.040 
you'll see this little muscle wire arm

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:37.130 
you'll see this little muscle wire arm
jump<00:06:35.580> up<00:06:35.760> and<00:06:35.970> then<00:06:36.390> I'll<00:06:36.510> turn<00:06:36.720> the<00:06:36.930> power

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:37.140 
jump up and then I'll turn the power

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:38.390 
jump up and then I'll turn the power
source<00:06:37.410> off<00:06:37.590> and<00:06:37.770> you'll<00:06:37.860> be<00:06:37.920> able<00:06:38.070> to<00:06:38.220> see

00:06:38.390 --> 00:06:38.400

source off and you'll be able to see
it'll<00:06:38.940> come<00:06:39.150> back<00:06:39.180> down<00:06:39.450> very<00:06:39.720> slowly<00:06:40.290> because

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:41.160 
it'll come back down very slowly because

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:42.800 
it'll come back down very slowly because
the<00:06:41.250> wire<00:06:41.430> actually<00:06:41.850> has<00:06:42.000> to<00:06:42.180> cool<00:06:42.450> off<00:06:42.780> in

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:42.810 
the wire actually has to cool off in

00:06:42.810 --> 00:06:45.500 
the wire actually has to cool off in
order<00:06:43.410> to<00:06:43.680> stretch<00:06:44.490> back<00:06:44.670> out<00:06:44.940> here<00:06:45.330> I've

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:45.510 
order to stretch back out here I've

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:46.940 
order to stretch back out here I've
connected<00:06:45.780> the<00:06:45.990> flexion<00:06:46.380> all<00:06:46.500> up<00:06:46.710> to<00:06:46.860> our

00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:46.950 
connected the flexion all up to our

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:48.920 
connected the flexion all up to our
bench<00:06:47.130> supply<00:06:47.490> and<00:06:47.850> you<00:06:48.240> can<00:06:48.390> see<00:06:48.600> we<00:06:48.750> got<00:06:48.870> a

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:48.930 
bench supply and you can see we got a

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:50.600 
bench supply and you can see we got a
little<00:06:49.290> bit<00:06:49.410> of<00:06:49.500> deflection<00:06:49.860> there<00:06:50.190> it<00:06:50.370> picked

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:50.610 
little bit of deflection there it picked

00:06:50.610 --> 00:06:52.490 
little bit of deflection there it picked
up<00:06:50.760> the<00:06:50.910> lever<00:06:51.150> and<00:06:51.450> it<00:06:51.900> did<00:06:52.110> it<00:06:52.230> pretty

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:52.500 
up the lever and it did it pretty

00:06:52.500 --> 00:06:55.310 
up the lever and it did it pretty
quickly<00:06:52.860> but<00:06:53.580> it's<00:06:53.880> not<00:06:54.120> it<00:06:54.420> it<00:06:54.750> wasn't<00:06:55.080> as

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:55.320 
quickly but it's not it it wasn't as

00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:56.930 
quickly but it's not it it wasn't as
much<00:06:55.530> action<00:06:55.830> as<00:06:56.190> you<00:06:56.340> got<00:06:56.490> with<00:06:56.640> the<00:06:56.730> must

00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:56.940 
much action as you got with the must

00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:59.840 
much action as you got with the must
wire<00:06:57.210> and<00:06:57.540> again<00:06:58.170> it<00:06:58.800> has<00:06:58.980> to<00:06:59.010> cool<00:06:59.490> down

00:06:59.840 --> 00:06:59.850 
wire and again it has to cool down

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:01.670 
wire and again it has to cool down
before<00:07:00.360> it'll<00:07:00.540> drop<00:07:00.750> the<00:07:00.960> lever<00:07:01.140> back<00:07:01.350> down

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:01.680 
before it'll drop the lever back down

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:03.710 
before it'll drop the lever back down
and<00:07:01.980> because<00:07:02.520> this<00:07:02.640> actuates<00:07:03.180> at<00:07:03.330> a<00:07:03.360> slightly

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:03.720 
and because this actuates at a slightly

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:05.570 
and because this actuates at a slightly
higher<00:07:03.870> temperature<00:07:04.350> it<00:07:04.830> takes<00:07:04.890> it<00:07:05.220> a<00:07:05.280> little

00:07:05.570 --> 00:07:05.580 
higher temperature it takes it a little

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:12.850 
higher temperature it takes it a little
longer<00:07:05.850> to<00:07:06.030> cool<00:07:06.360> down

00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:12.860 

00:07:12.860 --> 00:07:16.049
