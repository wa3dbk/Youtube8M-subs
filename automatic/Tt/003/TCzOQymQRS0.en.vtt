00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:13.730
 very good all guys who like 

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:16.910
 you are today without cleavage and what are you 

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:19.070
 watching is the first gameplay of the day in 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:21.800
 the modern warfare 3 to 5 people did not play 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.240
 modern warfare 3 and the truth is that yesterday 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.130
 I started to play for a while and I said good 

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.600
 I have the cover here of the white 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:28.490
 two I have the hard face here come here what 

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:30.350
 typical is the water les altres is down 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:32.840
 of everything with a little bit of dust and I said 

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:35.300
 if we play warfare 3 for a while if I do not 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:37.129
 urges to play for a while and things do not 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.900
 they were so bad and as if I get to 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:40.370
 do many say places that you have 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:42.800
 put to the new one is easy from the game such 

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:46.010
 I do not know why it is so easily kill it 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:48.320
 nothing I put in 90 that is a variant 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.580
 the one of memories with the silencer that 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.890
 they kill a lot that sometimes sometimes 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:53.210
 bullets do not enter and it's hard for them to enter but 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.159
 the truth is that it is a weapon that kills 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.720
 very much with assault data because I 

00:00:55.159 --> 00:00:58.129
 it seems more people had to go with rats than 

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:00.229
 assault that not with specialist gusts 

00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:01.940
 in this game because here the boats of 

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:04.970
 assault is still killing and you can make some 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:08.180
 considerable damage then I put myself 

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:10.820
 to play and I said the thing looks good 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:13.640
 it does not look bad it 's pretty cool and I 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.619
 I like it, I just like it. 

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.590
 as many commanders it is also true that 

00:01:15.619 --> 00:01:19.450
 things that the barça 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:20.710
 I did not give much not , for example, 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.240
 commanded as I am saying 

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.729
 also the theme of the already berlin that 

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:26.469
 they have a random guy and they destroy you 

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:28.149
 you tell me you won, they really enjoyed 

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:30.939
 baskonia well pulling already abel and that 

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:32.979
 have a contract of 18 are things that 

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:34.090
 they would have to name a lot but in the end 

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:36.850
 After the 

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:38.289
 Well, you're getting a little fond of yourself and not 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:39.100
 it comes from time to time it would vary you know 

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:40.479
 what warfare 3 

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.729
 I like it a lot then because it knew 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:44.560
 go down 3 because he had warfare 3 because 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:46.329
 I want you to tell me if you want me to continue 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.219
 going up and we go up the night because 

00:01:46.329 --> 00:01:49.630
 Now that August arrives , I want to give 

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:51.610
 a little more variety and finish the 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.039
 things that are left and it would not hurt 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:56.079
 so go up warfare 3 so if you want 

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:57.459
 I can upload I can do games in live 

00:01:56.079 --> 00:02:01.509
 well I do not know any water streak to with 

00:01:57.459 --> 00:02:03.969
 assault any more if I get it then 

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:05.500
 Cool things that I think can be 

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:06.969
 very good but I always need 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.500
 your consent to say yes os 

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:09.819
 like to see it on the channel we would like 

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.530
 see them if they vary a bit from those of 

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:13.090
 two whites that are already boring a bit and 

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.319
 waiting for it to be after saving then a 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.220
 little bit of warfare 3 that for me 

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:17.049
 it seems that it is a game that is going to 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.879
 it seems not much but it will look like a 

00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:20.440
 little bit a bit more futuristic and 

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:22.359
 that but I think the theme of 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.490
 sensitivities and things like that 

00:02:22.359 --> 00:02:26.560
 It is also a very cool game and 

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:30.070
 explain why it's a very game 

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:31.870
 cool because we start walking 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:34.120
 pretty good wax I go in that the 

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:37.270
 game started and there is a guy who 

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:39.070
 contract of 10 there is no other with streak of 

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:41.110
 5 my team is going fatal we are losing the 

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:43.300
 departure and good then the truth that 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:45.910
 he managed to come back and my team ends 

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:48.370
 fatal the game and ended it with 60 casualties 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:51.180
 with the pay flow bursting that the truth 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:55.720
 it's an assault streak that I love and 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:58.300
 because the truth is not a game the 

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:00.010
 esma is the departure of the century of assumption 

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:02.410
 and nothing but since it's the first 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.930
 game that I missed in my mother and not 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:06.880
 I know how much time it was worth 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.100
 upload it and also to vary a bit 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.050
 As I'm telling you, no, no, no, 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.150
 of the subject of the commanders that is hateful 

00:03:11.050 --> 00:03:14.980
 and it's only the bullets it is 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.900
 rare but sometimes it cost to enter the 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:19.360
 bullets with mental grief especially with 

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.580
 the most with silencer true but still 

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:24.130
 being a great game structuring then 

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:27.580
 themes of the key or the hand of the dead 

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:30.010
 things that are overcome I almodóvar 3 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:31.330
 he called it the troll call of duty 

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:33.520
 because it 's that 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:35.320
 to trollear perfectly and maybe 

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:36.970
 that's a bit what's left over 

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.620
 this game but the truth that the weapons 

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:39.820
 they are very good it's pretty well done 

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:41.950
 the sensitivities are pretty good 

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:43.930
 made the advantages are very cool and 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:46.600
 that makes good though love is a 

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:49.510
 little more complicated to take out than the one 

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:52.360
 because in this game let's say that 

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:53.860
 dies let's say that if I take more I will die 

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:55.660
 and caloto ticos pre deaths pretty 

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:57.580
 false there are no deaths of two of two 

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:59.140
 bullets and things like that but it 's a game 

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:01.180
 quite complete that in the end you 

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:02.860
 ends up liking and that as I'm already 

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:04.360
 saying for a change because I have the 

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:06.670
 warfare2 covers out there from the 

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:09.370
 warfare 3 and once in a while I say come 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:11.980
 Okay, so I'm encouraged, I'm going to play and if it comes out 

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:13.300
 Well, some game, not split 

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:15.370
 the host but a game that I can 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:17.650
 show visible we get also then 

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:19.420
 going up the game then giving them wax 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:21.100
 at the end of the whole that is the part 

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:23.950
 effectively that I'm going up in the 

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:25.840
 part of everything in which villainy and 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:28.990
 PEF caught caught with what will death 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:31.690
 but I keep taking the streak of assault two 

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:33.490
 times and the truth that the second time is 

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:35.760
 the one that counts because the first one that we 

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:37.800
 they killed the full month of ico good 

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.840
 I have been on the road in which they are already going when 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.970
 I played and I do not take the helicopter 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.350
 attack helicopter support and pay 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:44.960
 flow you already know why because if it happens 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:47.310
 by helicopter 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:48.660
 normally the second helicopter comes out 

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:50.040
 alone and once you have the first one and 

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:52.440
 the second and they do not destroy it for you 

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:53.730
 picnic also goes out alone are you already know 

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:56.460
 that I like gusts of killing that 

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:58.050
 are not controllable for example in the 

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:59.880
 coasts you already know that I do not like almost the 

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:01.260
 streak of assault and if I put then they are 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:02.700
 dogs swarm because before they are more 

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:04.800
 high that for example he should not be 

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:07.020
 the button are gusts that kill a lot 

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.850
 I do not like to control them I like 

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:13.080
 control them I like to have control 

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:14.220
 about them and well you know that I 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:15.870
 like more than the power map while 

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:18.190
 I kill because that's how low are extras that I 

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:20.230
 I'm doing, they're counting 

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:22.000
 well that is this is your decision 

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:23.620
 guys you decide to tell me if you want me 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.940
 let's go up to the same far 3 because I think that 

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:26.440
 man who is very cool you know that 

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:28.030
 tomorrow there will be how to improve the call of 

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:29.890
 duty that keeps raising the spots of the 

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:32.860
 remaining maps that are left a few 

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:34.270
 and they will surely go up tomorrow because I went up 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:36.130
 the next the last time to the best 

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:38.740
 is still root or something 

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:40.960
 similar but the truth that I have the 

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:42.250
 pretty much planned things and especially 

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:45.280
 well, to enter into my plans a little 

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:47.110
 warfare 3 that if you want then that is 

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:49.060
 more than done more is a game and 

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:50.350
 it seemed to vary with the weapons not only 

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:52.360
 that would put the cheeta weapons not what 

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:54.430
 would it be worth the sale would it put me in 

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:57.400
 the impression would make you cool things the 

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:59.460
 vp 45 long guns to vary 

00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:01.540
 the distances and to try to kill more 

00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:03.670
 assigned guys because you tell me 

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:05.800
 in the comments it's worth it and if you want 

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:08.140
 climb it is not very cool and the truth 

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:09.910
 that surprisingly for me I thought 

00:06:08.140 --> 00:06:12.040
 that it was going to get worse on the first day of 

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:13.480
 game equal to 3 but I said fuck then 

00:06:12.040 --> 00:06:15.460
 the truth that I bust enough and I can 

00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:16.930
 play it and we may like it not because 

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:18.100
 you know that I am still the majority of 

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:19.990
 Maybe time to do it 

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:21.550
 a low one of the streak as 

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:23.650
 playing more tactical but I'm always 

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:24.880
 moving around the map assigned 

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:26.050
 Boys 

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:27.430
 he liked the video and grace 

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:30.810
 favorites and see you tomorrow on how 

00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:30.810
 improvement in the call of duty until then
