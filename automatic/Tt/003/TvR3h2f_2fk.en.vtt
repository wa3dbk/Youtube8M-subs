00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:10.660 
I'll be referring to this a lot I'm

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:12.539 
I'll be referring to this a lot I'm
gonna<00:02:10.869> start<00:02:11.200> on<00:02:11.350> the<00:02:11.500> low<00:02:11.709> E<00:02:11.739> string<00:02:11.980> your

00:02:12.539 --> 00:02:12.549 
gonna start on the low E string your

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:14.520 
gonna start on the low E string your
thickest<00:02:13.000> string<00:02:13.420> and<00:02:13.660> I'm<00:02:13.780> going<00:02:13.810> to<00:02:14.200> walk

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:14.530 
thickest string and I'm going to walk

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:23.420 
thickest string and I'm going to walk
across<00:02:15.090> like<00:02:16.090> this

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:24.949 

when<00:02:23.790> I<00:02:23.819> get<00:02:23.909> to<00:02:24.150> the<00:02:24.239> top<00:02:24.420> I'm<00:02:24.659> going<00:02:24.780> to<00:02:24.840> go

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:24.959 
when I get to the top I'm going to go

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:32.040 
when I get to the top I'm going to go
back

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:32.050 

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:34.590 

now<00:02:32.770> I<00:02:32.980> just<00:02:33.040> did<00:02:33.490> the<00:02:33.940> same<00:02:34.180> thing<00:02:34.390> on<00:02:34.480> every

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:34.600 
now I just did the same thing on every

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.630 
now I just did the same thing on every
strand<00:02:34.960> just<00:02:35.560> walk<00:02:35.830> across<00:02:36.010> we're<00:02:36.490> just

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:36.640 
strand just walk across we're just

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.280 
strand just walk across we're just
trying<00:02:36.880> to<00:02:36.940> get<00:02:37.090> these<00:02:37.240> fingers<00:02:37.630> warmed<00:02:37.930> up

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.290 
trying to get these fingers warmed up

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.920 
trying to get these fingers warmed up
also<00:02:38.860> notice<00:02:39.250> I'm<00:02:39.460> using<00:02:39.760> alternate<00:02:40.690> picking

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930 
also notice I'm using alternate picking

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:44.190 
also notice I'm using alternate picking
for<00:02:41.350> this<00:02:41.470> exercise<00:02:42.990> alternate<00:02:43.990> picking

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200 
for this exercise alternate picking

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.570 
for this exercise alternate picking
means<00:02:44.530> down<00:02:44.890> up<00:02:45.400> down<00:02:46.270> up<00:02:46.720> down<00:02:47.290> up<00:02:47.770> every<00:02:48.400> note

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
means down up down up down up every note

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:51.090 
means down up down up down up every note
is<00:02:48.760> the<00:02:48.880> opposite<00:02:49.300> direction<00:02:49.860> even<00:02:50.860> when<00:02:51.010> we

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:51.100 
is the opposite direction even when we

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:53.460 
is the opposite direction even when we
change<00:02:51.340> strings<00:02:51.640> okay<00:02:52.180> this<00:02:52.930> is<00:02:53.080> pretty<00:02:53.260> easy

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470 
change strings okay this is pretty easy

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:54.870 
change strings okay this is pretty easy
when<00:02:53.680> we're<00:02:53.830> only<00:02:53.950> doing<00:02:54.130> two<00:02:54.430> notes<00:02:54.670> per

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
when we're only doing two notes per

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:56.970 
when we're only doing two notes per
string<00:02:54.910> it<00:02:55.720> will<00:02:55.960> become<00:02:56.410> trickier<00:02:56.860> when

00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:56.980 
string it will become trickier when

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.250 
string it will become trickier when
you're<00:02:57.160> doing<00:02:57.400> three<00:02:57.730> notes<00:02:57.940> per<00:02:58.090> string<00:02:58.260> but

00:02:59.250 --> 00:02:59.260 
you're doing three notes per string but

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:00.570 
you're doing three notes per string but
we'll<00:02:59.380> worry<00:02:59.590> about<00:02:59.650> that<00:02:59.800> when<00:03:00.010> we<00:03:00.190> get<00:03:00.340> there

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:00.580 
we'll worry about that when we get there

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:13.100 
we'll worry about that when we get there
okay<00:03:00.760> let's<00:03:01.570> see<00:03:01.690> that<00:03:01.840> again

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:13.110 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:15.500 

okay<00:03:13.560> so<00:03:14.100> you<00:03:14.160> walk<00:03:14.430> across<00:03:14.640> the<00:03:15.030> strings<00:03:15.300> and

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:15.510 
okay so you walk across the strings and

00:03:15.510 --> 00:03:17.480 
okay so you walk across the strings and
back<00:03:15.690> and<00:03:16.050> then<00:03:16.290> what<00:03:16.410> do<00:03:16.500> you<00:03:16.530> do<00:03:16.710> that's<00:03:17.250> not

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:17.490 
back and then what do you do that's not

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:18.890 
back and then what do you do that's not
enough<00:03:17.730> exercise<00:03:17.940> you've<00:03:18.450> got<00:03:18.540> to<00:03:18.660> do<00:03:18.750> more

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
enough exercise you've got to do more

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.140 
enough exercise you've got to do more
than<00:03:18.960> that<00:03:19.170> you<00:03:19.320> got<00:03:19.440> to<00:03:19.560> slide<00:03:19.830> up<00:03:20.040> and<00:03:20.250> do<00:03:21.060> it

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
than that you got to slide up and do it

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:28.229 
than that you got to slide up and do it
again

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239 

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:34.040 

and<00:03:29.239> again

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:34.050 

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:36.470 

and<00:03:34.650> you<00:03:34.890> keep<00:03:35.070> going<00:03:35.130> all<00:03:35.640> the<00:03:36.000> way<00:03:36.030> up<00:03:36.300> the

00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:36.480 
and you keep going all the way up the

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:38.540 
and you keep going all the way up the
fretboard<00:03:36.720> until<00:03:37.380> you've<00:03:37.530> done<00:03:37.740> as<00:03:38.040> much<00:03:38.340> of

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:38.550 
fretboard until you've done as much of

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:40.900 
fretboard until you've done as much of
this<00:03:38.640> fretboard<00:03:39.120> as<00:03:39.270> you<00:03:39.390> can<00:03:39.570> handle<00:03:40.020> okay

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 
this fretboard as you can handle okay

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:43.010 
this fretboard as you can handle okay
that's<00:03:41.910> how<00:03:42.030> you<00:03:42.090> really<00:03:42.330> get<00:03:42.510> your<00:03:42.570> fingers

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:43.020 
that's how you really get your fingers

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:45.050 
that's how you really get your fingers
to<00:03:43.170> work<00:03:43.320> right<00:03:43.590> okay<00:03:44.130> now<00:03:44.730> we're<00:03:44.880> going<00:03:44.970> to

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:45.060

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.290 
take the same exercise and we're going
to<00:03:46.710> do<00:03:46.890> the<00:03:47.130> second<00:03:47.610> and<00:03:47.790> third<00:03:48.090> fingers

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:48.300 
to do the second and third fingers

00:03:48.300 --> 00:04:07.130 
to do the second and third fingers
second<00:03:48.870> and<00:03:48.990> third<00:03:49.200> fingers

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:28.390 

00:04:28.390 --> 00:04:30.640

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.360 
exercise with all the different pairs of

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.140 
exercise with all the different pairs of
fingers<00:04:32.780> also<00:04:33.530> notice<00:04:33.890> that<00:04:34.040> for<00:04:34.310> me<00:04:34.460> probably

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:35.150 
fingers also notice that for me probably

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:36.670 
fingers also notice that for me probably
because<00:04:35.510> I've<00:04:35.630> been<00:04:35.750> doing<00:04:35.900> these<00:04:36.200> exercises

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:36.680 
because I've been doing these exercises

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:39.670 
because I've been doing these exercises
for<00:04:37.010> a<00:04:37.190> couple<00:04:37.550> of<00:04:37.610> decades<00:04:37.910> by<00:04:38.180> now<00:04:38.360> I<00:04:38.680> have

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:39.680 
for a couple of decades by now I have

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.550 
for a couple of decades by now I have
pretty<00:04:40.070> much<00:04:40.250> the<00:04:40.460> same<00:04:40.670> speed<00:04:41.390> with<00:04:41.900> every

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:42.560 
pretty much the same speed with every

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.500 
pretty much the same speed with every
pair<00:04:42.830> of<00:04:42.980> fingers<00:04:43.340> I<00:04:43.520> can<00:04:43.790> go<00:04:43.910> just<00:04:44.120> as<00:04:44.270> fast

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:44.510 
pair of fingers I can go just as fast

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:46.330 
pair of fingers I can go just as fast
with<00:04:45.110> my<00:04:45.230> third<00:04:45.440> and<00:04:45.590> fourth<00:04:45.770> fingers<00:04:46.100> as<00:04:46.250> I

00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:46.340 
with my third and fourth fingers as I

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:48.730 
with my third and fourth fingers as I
can<00:04:46.520> with<00:04:46.670> my<00:04:46.700> first<00:04:47.000> and<00:04:47.180> second<00:04:47.480> fingers<00:04:47.810> if

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:48.740 
can with my first and second fingers if

been doing these exercises for a long

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.490 
been doing these exercises for a long
time

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:54.500 
time

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:56.740 
time
well<00:04:55.160> you<00:04:55.550> just<00:04:55.760> need<00:04:55.940> to<00:04:56.120> do<00:04:56.270> more<00:04:56.480> of<00:04:56.540> the

00:04:59.020 --> 00:04:59.030 
exercises and also eventually think of
