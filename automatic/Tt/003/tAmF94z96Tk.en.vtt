00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:06.609
 good morning everyone today I am going to teach you 

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:08.200
 to make the snacks but first thing 

00:00:06.609 --> 00:00:10.690
 what I wanted to do is to thank 

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:12.370
 borja fernandez who has sent me my 

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:15.519
 new logo that is the first one 

00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:17.110
 you will see that the video has come out 

00:00:15.519 --> 00:00:20.230
 Sausages is very easy we need 

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:22.119
 puff pastry in a beaten egg by 

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:24.910
 I'm going to make an example of tortilla 

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:26.669
 of sausage and tie with peppers 

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:29.200
 You can do them with whatever you want 

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:31.430
 ham and cheese you can throw him 

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:33.470
 you chocolate 

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:34.730
 what you want what we need 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:36.860
 the knife has the puff pastry 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.050
 we open it to this vegetable paper what 

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.640
 we will take advantage of value and cut it more 

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:43.340
 or less so 

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:45.740
 of this measure 

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:49.190
 It is an approximate value 

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:51.260
 it does not have to be perfect 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.440
 then we cut it we make several 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.440
 strips 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:01:01.340
 and for example now I'm going to do the 

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:01.340
 sausages we take we put 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:09.310
 we roll and cut 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:12.280
 here to this extent more or less and already 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.780
 we would have one and so we will be doing with 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.100
 everything now I'm going to leave because I'm going to go 

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.450
 rolling this so you can see the 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:18.090
 sausage new tortilla designs 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.390
 potato and then I teach you to us 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.860
 we expose 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:26.280
 we roll and cut 

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:30.270
 well now let's make the tortilla 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:34.100
 then with the tortilla we place it 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.100
 and the same thing is rolled 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.490
 the size do not worry much because 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:40.010
 not being in a little bit bigger is 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:42.650
 a little bit smaller and then it's already 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:45.490
 It puts like this we will do the same with 

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:48.720
 all of the tortilla we will place 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.720
 we'll give it a spin 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.020
 and we will cut it 

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:00.180
 you see and that's how we're left with tortillas 

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:04.909
 now we will go with the part of the debate 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:06.619
 we take a little bit I'm less 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:09.289
 complicated because it's easier to 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:11.840
 roll then we roll it up and what 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:14.269
 we crushed a little those of pate the 

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:17.480
 we will close well so that it does not come out 

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:19.459
 and so we will do everything and then we will 

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:21.290
 taught once we have done 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:23.920
 seen how easy it is to do it then we 

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:26.930
 crush is a little bit always a little bit 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:29.750
 the crush is for them to take a form 

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:31.580
 more rectangular I already made one 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.900
 tray now with a beaten egg 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.400
 which is what I told you then 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.280
 we will paint a little bit this is so that it 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.530
 double vale 

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.900
 neither do we need to have it much 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:43.500
 because it does not have to be that way and 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.550
 roasted toast 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:48.370
 you see 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:50.670
 then I have done it in everything until 

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.670
 you see how easy 

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:53.620
 I have some that are salty, others that 

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.069
 they are sweet that you can also do 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.069
 sweet 

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:03.240
 we take him out and now we will take him and 

00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:07.060
 we will toss the sesame or sesame as 

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:08.920
 you want to call we miss you on the other hand 

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.330
 and this goes to the oven the oven you have it 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:13.050
 to leave preheated I have it 

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:13.050
 preheated to 180 

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:21.620
 you see then this for the oven 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:31.320

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:35.310
