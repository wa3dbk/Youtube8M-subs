00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.270 
sell at a higher price to our best
customers<00:03:28.060> or<00:03:28.989> should<00:03:29.170> we<00:03:29.260> try<00:03:29.500> to<00:03:29.530> simplify

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:30.280 
customers or should we try to simplify

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:32.490 
customers or should we try to simplify
and<00:03:30.730> have<00:03:30.850> fewer<00:03:31.180> features<00:03:31.510> so<00:03:32.019> that<00:03:32.049> it<00:03:32.290> just

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
and have fewer features so that it just

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.750 
and have fewer features so that it just
goes<00:03:32.739> to<00:03:32.769> them<00:03:33.299> the<00:03:34.299> mainstream<00:03:35.080> customer<00:03:36.069> not

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:36.760 
goes to them the mainstream customer not

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:41.280 
goes to them the mainstream customer not
the<00:03:36.970> best<00:03:38.280> inside<00:03:39.280> the<00:03:39.489> company<00:03:39.910> always<00:03:40.290> the

the best inside the company always the

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.580 
the best inside the company always the
higher<00:03:41.530> price<00:03:41.890> more<00:03:42.580> complexity<00:03:43.590> more

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
higher price more complexity more

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:47.309 
higher price more complexity more
complex<00:03:45.190> requirement<00:03:46.030> will<00:03:46.540> appear<00:03:46.959> to<00:03:47.140> be

00:03:47.309 --> 00:03:47.319 
complex requirement will appear to be

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:50.009 
complex requirement will appear to be
more<00:03:47.880> attractive<00:03:48.880> to<00:03:48.910> you<00:03:49.180> too<00:03:49.299> than<00:03:49.510> simple

00:03:50.009 --> 00:03:50.019 
more attractive to you too than simple

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:54.710 
more attractive to you too than simple
and<00:03:50.590> so<00:03:51.220> the<00:03:51.370> very<00:03:51.670> purpose<00:03:52.120> of<00:03:52.569> innovative<00:03:53.349> of

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:54.720 
and so the very purpose of innovative of

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.270 
and so the very purpose of innovative of
sustaining<00:03:55.720> innovation<00:03:56.260> is<00:03:56.410> to<00:03:56.590> price<00:03:56.860> just

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 
sustaining innovation is to price just

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:58.700 
sustaining innovation is to price just
to<00:03:57.549> drive<00:03:57.760> prices

00:03:58.700 --> 00:03:58.710 
to drive prices

00:03:58.710 --> 00:04:02.900 
to drive prices
so<00:03:59.580> in<00:03:59.760> computers<00:04:01.130> everybody<00:04:02.130> is<00:04:02.310> trying<00:04:02.670> to

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
so in computers everybody is trying to

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:06.560 
so in computers everybody is trying to
sell<00:04:03.900> their<00:04:04.050> prices<00:04:04.830> are<00:04:04.860> their<00:04:05.610> products<00:04:06.330> at

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:06.570 
sell their prices are their products at

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:08.960 
sell their prices are their products at
higher<00:04:07.320> and<00:04:07.590> higher<00:04:07.620> prices<00:04:08.370> because<00:04:08.760> that's

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970 
higher and higher prices because that's

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:11.900 
higher and higher prices because that's
how<00:04:09.180> they<00:04:09.330> make<00:04:09.480> money<00:04:09.890> but<00:04:10.890> the<00:04:11.190> main<00:04:11.400> drive

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:11.910 
how they make money but the main drive

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:15.980 
how they make money but the main drive
is<00:04:12.810> to<00:04:13.320> simplicity<00:04:13.620> and<00:04:14.540> the<00:04:15.540> butt<00:04:15.780> but

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:15.990 
is to simplicity and the butt but

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:17.510 
is to simplicity and the butt but
through<00:04:16.260> disruption<00:04:16.980> and<00:04:17.130> so<00:04:17.340> the

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:17.520 
through disruption and so the

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:20.780 
through disruption and so the
combination<00:04:18.270> of<00:04:18.420> the<00:04:18.630> two<00:04:19.100> means<00:04:20.100> that<00:04:20.400> the

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:20.790 
combination of the two means that the

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:23.480 
combination of the two means that the
computing<00:04:21.390> industry<00:04:21.480> has<00:04:22.200> given<00:04:22.650> us<00:04:22.830> better

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
computing industry has given us better

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:26.060 
computing industry has given us better
and<00:04:23.790> better<00:04:24.030> quality<00:04:24.450> at<00:04:25.290> lower<00:04:25.680> and<00:04:25.980> lower

00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:26.070 
and better quality at lower and lower

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:32.750 
and better quality at lower and lower
prices<00:04:27.020> in<00:04:28.020> the<00:04:29.930> medical<00:04:30.930> industry<00:04:31.610> we<00:04:32.610> have

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:32.760 
prices in the medical industry we have

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:36.350 
prices in the medical industry we have
had<00:04:33.000> no<00:04:33.300> disruptive<00:04:34.460> industry<00:04:35.460> we've<00:04:36.120> had

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 
had no disruptive industry we've had

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:39.200 
had no disruptive industry we've had
very<00:04:36.660> little<00:04:37.100> disruptive<00:04:38.100> innovation<00:04:39.000> but

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:39.210 
very little disruptive innovation but

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:42.320 
very little disruptive innovation but
rather<00:04:39.450> it's<00:04:40.050> just<00:04:40.350> sustaining<00:04:41.330> after

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.330 
rather it's just sustaining after

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:44.690 
rather it's just sustaining after
sustaining<00:04:42.780> after<00:04:43.410> sustaining<00:04:43.860> innovation

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:44.700 
sustaining after sustaining innovation

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:47.690 
sustaining after sustaining innovation
and<00:04:45.600> because<00:04:46.140> you<00:04:46.320> don't<00:04:46.590> have<00:04:46.710> this<00:04:47.130> drive<00:04:47.670> to

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:47.700 
and because you don't have this drive to

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:50.930 
and because you don't have this drive to
bring<00:04:48.240> prices<00:04:48.750> down<00:04:48.990> all<00:04:49.620> you<00:04:49.920> have<00:04:50.160> is

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:50.940 
bring prices down all you have is

00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:54.340 
bring prices down all you have is
attempts<00:04:51.630> to<00:04:51.830> improve<00:04:52.830> our<00:04:52.980> profitability

attempts to improve our profitability

00:04:54.350 --> 00:05:00.939 
attempts to improve our profitability
yes<00:04:55.350> that's<00:04:56.330> in<00:04:57.330> the<00:04:57.840> United<00:04:58.230> States

00:05:00.939 --> 00:05:00.949
