00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:08.540
 The impact of love exchange between the puncher and the ark is a Philly with an excellent rock destructive power from now on 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:12.519
 I want a video called that one 

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:16.900
 But I've been before to put out about three months before I 2 years 

00:00:12.519 --> 00:00:17.820
 I would like to introduce some tips that are tips 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:22.660
 that 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:27.550
 Most tone in fact it said Aso Re left and right foot left and right foot 

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:31.180
 Te' hard to do but I'm moving Tteyuu going to I guess the Firin to increase the speed 

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:35.520
 If I try, my hands and feet don't move or something like that 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:40.980
 I think some people say that heavy sound speed does not go up 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:45.530
 As such a little bit recommended practice menu, please try by all means by all means 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:50.870
 But first of all, the first one is that one 

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:52.610
 Fulham Poku kinda got a care in Tteyuu let a little out a para flower feeling 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.900
 It is a menu 

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:59.190
 First of all 

00:00:54.900 --> 00:01:05.010
 I think some people say that it is quite difficult to divide them to the left and right 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:09.830
 So turnout is gone praised the two points that will be in God at the same time is also Te in the ridges 

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:09.830
 We will hit the Fu say foot in Karadaashi 

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:21.190
 If you get used to it 

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:22.010
 I shift the thing which I hit at the same time like a flam slightly 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:25.970
 day 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:28.659
 It is something that the left sacrifice fly run in that combination 

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:33.189
 We go to a little ahead of the left 

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:34.800
 I think it is okay to practice the right one right ahead with the right one right 

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:38.290
 I wish I had left 

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:40.650
 Hit it a little earlier from the left and ito 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:40.650
 4 minutes 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.540
 Hmm 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:58.799
 And gradually spread the roots 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.799
 Hera for three years will keep approaching Dora 

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.160
 voodoo 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:24.360
 3000 minutes 

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.840
 Close to 

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:30.739
 It 's different that it's a bit brutish now 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:33.930
 If you want to like it, it will be a little more 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:49.580
 Network Conversely I do not may become easier if 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:53.360
 Uu' UU uhh do 

00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:54.340

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:56.010
 Hmm 

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:58.730
 Yeah yeah yeah 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:02:58.730
 I am 

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:05.830
 Walkman 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:07.830
 def 

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:07.830
 Hmm 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:16.489
 Shift the things you are hitting at the same time a little and gradually fall apart 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:16.489
 Ne 

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:23.960
 Please try it 

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:26.410
 At first this was the first eye and 

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:29.430
 The second second 

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:36.740
 How is the pattern of today Lake Ashinoko 

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:38.060
 The left foot is put on the place where it opens to the place of the 21st first this hand 

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:39.590
 eh 

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:43.900
 The opposite bank and the door 

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:43.900
 Simultaneous Titan a diluted Hirai Dian 

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:58.070
 You do 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:58.070
 ben e 4 

00:03:59.020 --> 00:04:03.900
 war 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:03.900
 Hmm 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:09.160
 Let's take a walk 

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:18.150
 At first glance it feels difficult 

00:04:16.139 --> 00:04:24.180
 Pretty difficult 

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:26.220
 Well this the balance of the body a little bit by moving the left foot but I'm difficult for the better 

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:30.090
 I will guide you 

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:36.960
 It is quite high by the time it will be possible to transition smoothly 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:38.499
 It makes me feel good before moving to pay for care and making it easier to move before paying money 

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:41.560
 Come 

00:04:38.499 --> 00:04:48.050
 Speed ​​will be easier to increase 

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:53.389
 I think it will come like the first time it's really slow and it's fine , with the left foot 

00:04:48.050 --> 00:04:59.689
 Please try to practice Practice your mouth hard and succeed 

00:04:53.389 --> 00:05:03.880
 I can't move my right foot, and while looking at my child's right foot all the way to the right foot 

00:04:59.689 --> 00:05:10.650
 And I bought Toka Ka' to their Osaka with 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:10.650
 My right foot is getting hard to move and I can't speed up or let's go together 

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:16.380
 I Toka or've done an investment of left Toka og 

00:05:13.449 --> 00:05:21.500
 There are such people, but let's go in reverse 

00:05:16.380 --> 00:05:26.630
 I think some people say the weight and the law at the left end 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:32.920
 Don't keep it going for a long time to balance it 

00:05:26.630 --> 00:05:36.240
 Because the arms move because of the movement of the body, and the kitten is also in the middle of a good place 

00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:36.240
 Because it becomes easy to do 

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:40.570
 Thought 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:44.740
 Please try practicing with your left foot 

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:47.850
 I think it's quite difficult but you can do this 

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:47.850
 The one one 

00:05:49.849 --> 00:05:53.210
 Good 

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:55.169
 Nice nice nice 

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:58.830
 Because combination is made 

00:05:55.169 --> 00:06:07.050
 Suiseki has been practicing and I it this that 

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:09.080
 The left hand like a lie 2 roof technology bus of the bus with things to do charcoal and black tomorrow eyes out with a floor Noo 

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:11.590
 Now the rhythm of collaboration 

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:11.590

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:31.320
 voodoo 

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:34.920
 This load pan 

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:37.010
 While doing 

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:37.010
 I will 

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:53.340
 Yan Tsubasu does not have Tsubasu 

00:06:55.249 --> 00:06:57.639
 Then 

00:06:56.540 --> 00:07:00.590
 Is it a place 

00:06:57.639 --> 00:07:05.420
 If you are a graduate from-3 

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:09.530
 It is unusual that the day it was delicious 

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:10.720
 6 types of destructive power outstanding type 1 

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:16.200
