00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.190
 Hi everyone, today I want to do this 

00:00:02.669 --> 00:00:07.440
 short video to show you a little one 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:10.769
 curiosity about the camera and how 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.630
 burst burst mode borst works 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:17.310
 like how you want 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:20.490
 then holding in the center and 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.960
 rotating the screen as you can see 

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.109
 we can activate directly to 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.330
 camera to have this gesture already 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.039
 active I show them where you need to 

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.210
 go if you like 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.210
 we will have to go into the settings 

00:00:34.269 --> 00:00:41.839
 security options unlock screen e 

00:00:38.929 --> 00:00:43.250
 we should have activated quick access 

00:00:41.839 --> 00:00:45.589
 to the camera 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:48.920
 in this way we will have activated this 

00:00:45.589 --> 00:00:51.260
 sun gesture where the phase review seen 

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.390
 that anyway we have to go on 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.519
 camera 

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:58.869
 now let's go to the display I hold 

00:00:55.519 --> 00:01:03.920
 here in the center and display the display 

00:00:58.869 --> 00:01:06.970
 here they are here today I wanted to show 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:10.429
 the burst mode a few words there 

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:12.830
 allows you to take more photos and 

00:01:10.429 --> 00:01:16.850
 choose the best we could decide 

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:20.740
 to do it in two ways meanwhile we go to 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:23.780
 activate it here clicks multiple we can 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:26.179
 make twenty shots so that if you do them 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:29.000
 keep all events or if 

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:34.880
 we activate the best shot we can 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:36.709
 take 68 photos where it is light 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.600
 I will choose the best now I am a lot 

00:01:36.709 --> 00:01:41.240
 close, however, let's try to see if I 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.649
 I made the mode that chooses it 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:46.430
 best shot 

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:49.219
 we take the cost of the contract in fact 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:52.549
 as you can see now it does oct 

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:55.899
 and write me choose the best in 

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:59.929
 this case has chosen this here with 

00:01:55.899 --> 00:02:02.450
 with the m with the finger up yes now 

00:01:59.929 --> 00:02:07.179
 I do ok 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:10.759
 I go back and if I go back to the gallery 

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:13.489
 as you can see kept only one 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:15.019
 now here the autofocus a bit anyway 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:16.940
 how can you see gravitation only 

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:19.549
 one while we 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:23.480
 we take photos with the mode 

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:25.700
 deactivated luigiane will start 20 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:29.950
 as you can see the type you have to keep 

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:33.530
 pressed now I am a little close bunga 

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:35.090
 I hope you can understand is if they go 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:38.410
 to him the gallery does not take us to 

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.410
 better but keeps them all events 

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:45.840
 as you can see 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:48.240
 ok well i hope you understood this 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.760
 function and that you are there during the 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:54.090
 gesture to access the 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:56.930
 camera and that's all for now 

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.930
