00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.400 
proper jump technique I'm going to go
over<00:00:14.580> some<00:00:14.730> demonstrations<00:00:15.509> to<00:00:15.780> give<00:00:16.230> you<00:00:16.349> a

over some demonstrations to give you a

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.530 
over some demonstrations to give you a
visual<00:00:16.680> to<00:00:17.099> go<00:00:17.220> along<00:00:17.520> with<00:00:17.759> what<00:00:18.029> was<00:00:18.360> written

00:00:18.530 --> 00:00:18.540 
visual to go along with what was written

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:20.870 
visual to go along with what was written
about<00:00:18.869> the<00:00:19.200> new<00:00:19.320> footer<00:00:19.590> so<00:00:20.189> for<00:00:20.700> starters

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880 
about the new footer so for starters

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.240 
about the new footer so for starters
let's<00:00:21.869> go<00:00:21.960> over<00:00:22.140> the<00:00:22.259> lower<00:00:22.470> body<00:00:22.710> technique

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
let's go over the lower body technique

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.359 
let's go over the lower body technique
that<00:00:23.730> being<00:00:24.000> a<00:00:24.149> nice<00:00:24.329> narrow<00:00:24.630> base<00:00:25.040> stuff<00:00:26.040> for

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
that being a nice narrow base stuff for

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.240 
that being a nice narrow base stuff for
starters<00:00:26.790> and<00:00:27.029> that<00:00:27.989> means<00:00:28.290> because<00:00:28.680> your

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
starters and that means because your

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:30.889 
starters and that means because your
rope<00:00:29.460> is<00:00:29.610> traveling<00:00:30.119> in<00:00:30.210> an<00:00:30.300> arc<00:00:30.450> around<00:00:30.779> your

00:00:30.889 --> 00:00:30.899 
rope is traveling in an arc around your

00:00:30.899 --> 00:00:33.740 
rope is traveling in an arc around your
body<00:00:31.079> and<00:00:31.619> this<00:00:32.340> will<00:00:32.550> give<00:00:32.669> the<00:00:32.880> most<00:00:33.059> likely

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
body and this will give the most likely

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.389 
body and this will give the most likely
chance<00:00:34.050> of<00:00:34.230> passing<00:00:34.649> under<00:00:34.890> you<00:00:35.010> versus

00:00:35.389 --> 00:00:35.399 
chance of passing under you versus

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:37.099 
chance of passing under you versus
smacking<00:00:35.820> into<00:00:35.970> the<00:00:36.090> side

00:00:37.099 --> 00:00:37.109 
smacking into the side

00:00:37.109 --> 00:00:41.240 
smacking into the side
beep<00:00:37.289> or<00:00:37.760> into<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:38.879> front<00:00:39.149> of<00:00:39.210> them<00:00:40.250> creating

beep or into the front of them creating

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:42.860 
beep or into the front of them creating
those<00:00:41.370> annoying<00:00:41.789> trip<00:00:42.059> ups<00:00:42.269> that<00:00:42.390> people<00:00:42.690> tend

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
those annoying trip ups that people tend

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.950 
those annoying trip ups that people tend
to<00:00:42.960> have<00:00:43.109> so<00:00:43.890> from<00:00:44.789> there<00:00:44.999> you<00:00:45.030> want<00:00:45.359> your<00:00:45.479> legs

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
to have so from there you want your legs

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.560 
to have so from there you want your legs
nice<00:00:46.199> and<00:00:46.260> straight<00:00:46.699> not<00:00:47.699> locked<00:00:47.969> out<00:00:48.239> but

nice and straight not locked out but

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.270 
nice and straight not locked out but
just<00:00:48.719> straight<00:00:48.960> up<00:00:48.989> my<00:00:49.440> sit<00:00:49.769> standing<00:00:50.159> nice

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
just straight up my sit standing nice

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.639 
just straight up my sit standing nice
and<00:00:50.309> tall<00:00:50.579> and<00:00:51.000> this<00:00:51.989> is<00:00:52.109> where<00:00:52.260> we<00:00:52.350> get<00:00:52.469> into

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
and tall and this is where we get into

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.040 
and tall and this is where we get into
the<00:00:52.769> proper<00:00:53.129> jump

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.050 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.740 

the<00:00:57.770> biggest<00:00:58.100> error<00:00:58.550> that<00:00:59.000> people<00:00:59.360> have<00:00:59.540> and

00:00:59.740 --> 00:00:59.750 
the biggest error that people have and

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:01.210 
the biggest error that people have and
they're<00:00:59.870> in<00:01:00.230> their<00:01:00.380> jump<00:01:00.680> is<00:01:00.890> that<00:01:01.100> they're

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:01.220 
they're in their jump is that they're

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:02.980 
they're in their jump is that they're
jumping<00:01:01.610> from<00:01:01.700> their<00:01:01.880> upper<00:01:02.150> leg<00:01:02.360> that

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:02.990 
jumping from their upper leg that

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:04.780 
jumping from their upper leg that
creates<00:01:03.350> a<00:01:03.440> lot<00:01:03.590> more<00:01:03.620> time<00:01:04.010> spent<00:01:04.250> up<00:01:04.550> in<00:01:04.670> the

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:04.790 
creates a lot more time spent up in the

00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:06.970 
creates a lot more time spent up in the
air<00:01:04.940> and<00:01:05.210> on<00:01:05.660> the<00:01:05.690> ground<00:01:05.810> and<00:01:06.410> that<00:01:06.830> is

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:06.980 
air and on the ground and that is

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:08.710 
air and on the ground and that is
necessary<00:01:07.550> especially<00:01:08.060> if<00:01:08.150> you're<00:01:08.300> if<00:01:08.660> you're

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:08.720 
necessary especially if you're if you're

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.620 
necessary especially if you're if you're
desiring<00:01:09.530> to<00:01:09.790> increase<00:01:10.790> your<00:01:10.940> speed<00:01:11.300> skills

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
desiring to increase your speed skills

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:17.040 
desiring to increase your speed skills
so<00:01:12.260> an<00:01:12.740> example<00:01:12.890> of<00:01:13.340> this<00:01:13.550> jump<00:01:14.270> is<00:01:14.540> right<00:01:14.780> here

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:17.050 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:19.660 

focus<00:01:18.050> I'm<00:01:18.170> bending<00:01:18.530> at<00:01:18.680> my<00:01:18.830> knees<00:01:19.070> and

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:19.670 
focus I'm bending at my knees and

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.060 
focus I'm bending at my knees and
propelling<00:01:20.600> myself<00:01:20.690> up<00:01:21.200> kind<00:01:21.770> of<00:01:21.800> like<00:01:22.010> a

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:22.070 
propelling myself up kind of like a

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:28.450 
propelling myself up kind of like a
squat<00:01:22.520> jump

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:28.460 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:31.360 

this<00:01:28.910> is<00:01:29.060> the<00:01:29.180> plyometrics<00:01:30.470> explosive

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:31.370 
this is the plyometrics explosive

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:34.270 
this is the plyometrics explosive
movement<00:01:31.850> on<00:01:31.970> the<00:01:32.210> floor<00:01:32.480> and<00:01:33.160> then<00:01:34.160> you're

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280 
movement on the floor and then you're

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:35.590 
movement on the floor and then you're
ultimately<00:01:34.670> going<00:01:34.940> to<00:01:35.150> want<00:01:35.330> to<00:01:35.420> get<00:01:35.540> that

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:35.600 
ultimately going to want to get that

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:38.260 
ultimately going to want to get that
down<00:01:36.020> toward<00:01:36.800> your<00:01:36.860> jumping<00:01:37.520> so<00:01:37.790> you're<00:01:38.030> just

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:38.270 
down toward your jumping so you're just

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:40.180 
down toward your jumping so you're just
high<00:01:38.540> enough<00:01:38.570> to<00:01:38.900> get<00:01:39.020> over<00:01:39.050> the<00:01:39.260> rope<00:01:39.500> or<00:01:39.800> like

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:40.190 
high enough to get over the rope or like

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:41.650 
high enough to get over the rope or like
you're<00:01:40.310> jumping<00:01:40.550> over<00:01:40.880> a<00:01:40.910> credit<00:01:41.240> card<00:01:41.420> or<00:01:41.630> a

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:41.660 
you're jumping over a credit card or a

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:44.550 
you're jumping over a credit card or a
piece<00:01:41.810> of<00:01:41.960> paper

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:44.560 

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.149 

so<00:01:45.220> here's<00:01:45.400> a<00:01:45.490> close-up<00:01:45.729> of<00:01:46.090> my<00:01:46.470> of<00:01:47.470> the<00:01:47.770> ankle

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:48.159 
so here's a close-up of my of the ankle

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:51.000 
so here's a close-up of my of the ankle
jump<00:01:48.510> so<00:01:49.510> you<00:01:49.600> can<00:01:49.720> get<00:01:49.810> a<00:01:49.840> better<00:01:50.080> feel<00:01:50.409> for<00:01:50.440> it

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:51.010 
jump so you can get a better feel for it

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:53.399 
jump so you can get a better feel for it
it's<00:01:51.400> just<00:01:51.549> raising<00:01:51.880> up<00:01:52.000> on<00:01:52.150> your<00:01:52.330> toes<00:01:52.540> pull

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:53.409 
it's just raising up on your toes pull

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:59.530 
it's just raising up on your toes pull
those<00:01:53.650> toes<00:01:53.860> back<00:01:54.070> up<00:01:54.220> into<00:01:54.400> the<00:01:54.520> air

00:01:59.530 --> 00:01:59.540 

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:04.980 

and<00:01:59.780> speeding<00:02:00.290> it<00:02:00.350> up

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:04.990 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:06.630 

your<00:02:05.530> heels<00:02:05.770> shouldn't<00:02:06.159> be<00:02:06.220> touching<00:02:06.430> the

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
your heels shouldn't be touching the

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:09.660 
your heels shouldn't be touching the
ground<00:02:07.050> and<00:02:08.050> if<00:02:08.200> they<00:02:08.319> do<00:02:08.380> slightly<00:02:08.800> no<00:02:09.459> weight

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:09.670 
ground and if they do slightly no weight

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:11.339 
ground and if they do slightly no weight
should<00:02:09.849> be<00:02:09.970> put<00:02:10.179> on<00:02:10.209> them<00:02:10.509> but<00:02:10.989> you're<00:02:11.140> just

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:11.349 
should be put on them but you're just

00:02:11.349 --> 00:02:18.250 
should be put on them but you're just
jumping<00:02:11.590> high<00:02:11.890> enough<00:02:12.069> to<00:02:12.220> get<00:02:12.310> over<00:02:12.370> the<00:02:12.640> rope

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.290 

one<00:02:19.129> your<00:02:19.340> temple<00:02:19.730> is<00:02:19.760> going<00:02:19.940> to<00:02:20.000> be<00:02:20.090> much

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:20.300 
one your temple is going to be much

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.550 
one your temple is going to be much
quicker<00:02:20.540> than<00:02:20.720> before<00:02:21.200> and<00:02:21.680> and<00:02:22.640> so<00:02:23.300> and<00:02:24.019> two

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
quicker than before and and so and two

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.199 
quicker than before and and so and two
that<00:02:25.250> means<00:02:25.519> that<00:02:25.700> you're<00:02:25.819> going<00:02:25.970> to<00:02:26.030> have<00:02:26.120> to

00:02:26.199 --> 00:02:26.209 
that means that you're going to have to

00:02:26.209 --> 00:02:28.210 
that means that you're going to have to
develop<00:02:26.420> new<00:02:26.599> timings<00:02:27.140> and<00:02:27.319> rhythms<00:02:27.650> that's

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:28.220 
develop new timings and rhythms that's

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.040 
develop new timings and rhythms that's
going<00:02:28.400> to<00:02:28.459> be<00:02:28.610> with<00:02:29.180> your<00:02:29.360> wrists<00:02:29.720> feet<00:02:29.930> as

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:30.050 
going to be with your wrists feet as

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:33.420 
going to be with your wrists feet as
well<00:02:30.290> so<00:02:31.040> if<00:02:31.640> I<00:02:31.790> jump<00:02:32.090> a<00:02:32.330> little<00:02:32.900> bit<00:02:33.050> higher

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
well so if I jump a little bit higher

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:37.140 
well so if I jump a little bit higher
higher<00:02:34.930> I'm<00:02:35.930> still<00:02:36.200> going<00:02:36.440> at<00:02:36.560> a<00:02:36.590> slower<00:02:36.920> pace

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:37.150 
higher I'm still going at a slower pace

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.580 
higher I'm still going at a slower pace
but<00:02:38.150> I<00:02:38.180> can<00:02:38.360> start<00:02:38.599> reading<00:02:38.870> that<00:02:39.050> jump<00:02:39.349> lower

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
but I can start reading that jump lower

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.400 
but I can start reading that jump lower
and<00:02:39.920> lower<00:02:40.069> and<00:02:41.060> as<00:02:41.239> I<00:02:41.390> do<00:02:41.450> that<00:02:41.569> my<00:02:41.780> risk<00:02:42.200> of

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.410 
and lower and as I do that my risk of

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:51.130 
and lower and as I do that my risk of
the<00:02:42.530> speed<00:02:42.830> up<00:02:43.450> it's<00:02:44.450> got<00:02:44.630> to<00:02:44.750> match<00:02:50.080> so<00:02:51.080> you

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:51.140 
the speed up it's got to match so you

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:52.660 
the speed up it's got to match so you
will<00:02:51.410> notice<00:02:51.590> that<00:02:51.890> you<00:02:52.010> can<00:02:52.040> pick<00:02:52.370> up<00:02:52.489> a

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:52.670 
will notice that you can pick up a

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.330 
will notice that you can pick up a
tremendous<00:02:52.880> amount<00:02:53.390> of<00:02:53.420> speed<00:02:53.920> by<00:02:54.920> doing<00:02:55.250> that

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:55.340 
tremendous amount of speed by doing that

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.050 
tremendous amount of speed by doing that
proper<00:02:55.790> jump<00:02:56.030> and<00:02:56.680> that<00:02:57.680> jump<00:02:58.069> the<00:02:58.430> ankle<00:02:58.790> jump

00:02:59.050 --> 00:02:59.060 
proper jump and that jump the ankle jump

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:02.949 
proper jump and that jump the ankle jump
is<00:02:59.780> going<00:03:00.049> to<00:03:00.140> be<00:03:00.290> what<00:03:00.500> you<00:03:00.620> use<00:03:00.890> in<00:03:01.690> in<00:03:02.690> all

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:02.959 
is going to be what you use in in all

00:03:02.959 --> 00:03:05.170 
is going to be what you use in in all
your<00:03:03.110> jump<00:03:03.380> roping<00:03:03.739> so<00:03:03.980> some<00:03:04.519> demonstrations

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:05.180 
your jump roping so some demonstrations

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:06.610 
your jump roping so some demonstrations
of<00:03:05.269> that<00:03:05.450> could<00:03:05.989> be<00:03:06.110> whether<00:03:06.319> it's<00:03:06.530> a

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
of that could be whether it's a

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:16.890 
of that could be whether it's a
two-footed<00:03:07.099> job<00:03:07.450> one<00:03:08.450> footed<00:03:14.260> side<00:03:15.260> straddle

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
two-footed job one footed side straddle

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:22.260 
two-footed job one footed side straddle
and<00:03:17.900> even<00:03:18.170> double<00:03:18.530> unders

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:22.270 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:26.860 

so<00:03:24.550> don't<00:03:25.550> get<00:03:25.640> frustrated<00:03:25.940> when<00:03:26.420> that<00:03:26.569> timing

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
so don't get frustrated when that timing

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:28.690 
so don't get frustrated when that timing
and<00:03:27.290> rhythm<00:03:27.620> gets<00:03:27.950> a<00:03:28.069> little<00:03:28.280> bit<00:03:28.370> goofed<00:03:28.550> up

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700 
and rhythm gets a little bit goofed up

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:30.850 
and rhythm gets a little bit goofed up
for<00:03:28.940> you<00:03:29.030> with<00:03:29.180> this<00:03:29.300> new<00:03:29.480> tongue<00:03:29.720> just<00:03:30.709> give

for you with this new tongue just give

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:33.940 
for you with this new tongue just give
yourself<00:03:31.190> about<00:03:31.370> 10<00:03:31.670> to<00:03:31.790> 15<00:03:32.180> minutes<00:03:32.830> free<00:03:33.830> and

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:33.950 
yourself about 10 to 15 minutes free and

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:35.860 
yourself about 10 to 15 minutes free and
close<00:03:34.190> to<00:03:34.340> workouts<00:03:34.700> or<00:03:34.970> pre<00:03:35.360> or<00:03:35.540> post
