what platform are you getting it on I'm
kind<00:01:01.440> of<00:01:01.559> surprised<00:01:01.829> that<00:01:02.010> this<00:01:02.160> game<00:01:02.370> is

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
kind of surprised that this game is

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.520 
kind of surprised that this game is

being released for xbox 360 and ps3

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.620 
being released for xbox 360 and ps3
because<00:01:05.220> this<00:01:05.369> seems<00:01:05.610> like<00:01:05.729> a<00:01:05.850> game<00:01:06.119> that's

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
because this seems like a game that's

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.270 
because this seems like a game that's
really<00:01:06.869> going<00:01:07.020> to<00:01:07.110> push<00:01:07.350> the<00:01:07.560> technical<00:01:08.100> side

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
really going to push the technical side

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.060 
really going to push the technical side
of<00:01:08.340> gaming<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.510> graphics<00:01:10.080> the<00:01:10.350> world<00:01:10.740> in

of gaming the graphics the world in
general<00:01:11.310> it<00:01:11.610> seems<00:01:12.090> like<00:01:12.299> a<00:01:12.330> huge<00:01:12.659> world<00:01:13.020> and

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
general it seems like a huge world and

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.710 
general it seems like a huge world and
with<00:01:13.500> that<00:01:13.650> visual<00:01:14.189> scope<00:01:14.520> it<00:01:15.060> seems<00:01:15.570> like

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
with that visual scope it seems like

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:16.820 
with that visual scope it seems like
something<00:01:16.080> really<00:01:16.290> hard<00:01:16.530> to<00:01:16.680> do<00:01:16.799> on

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
something really hard to do on

racing scene in the game and it looks
really<00:01:35.520> terrible<00:01:36.360> and<00:01:36.570> I'd<00:01:37.140> be<00:01:37.320> starting<00:01:37.920> to

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:38.130 
really terrible and I'd be starting to

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:39.740 
really terrible and I'd be starting to
become<00:01:38.280> more<00:01:38.640> weary<00:01:38.970> with<00:01:39.270> this<00:01:39.420> kind<00:01:39.659> of

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
become more weary with this kind of

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.660 
become more weary with this kind of
stuff<00:01:39.990> because<00:01:40.380> a<00:01:40.590> lot<00:01:40.979> of<00:01:41.009> these<00:01:41.189> games<00:01:41.400> that

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
stuff because a lot of these games that

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:42.830 
stuff because a lot of these games that
have<00:01:41.759> been<00:01:41.850> coming<00:01:42.060> out<00:01:42.240> this<00:01:42.420> year<00:01:42.479> have<00:01:42.810> been

have been coming out this year have been
really<00:01:43.500> big<00:01:43.770> letdown<00:01:44.189> so<00:01:44.640> a<00:01:44.700> game<00:01:44.880> like<00:01:45.090> d<00:01:45.479> for

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
really big letdown so a game like d for

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:46.880 
really big letdown so a game like d for
that<00:01:45.899> was<00:01:46.049> one<00:01:46.200> of<00:01:46.290> my<00:01:46.409> most<00:01:46.619> anticipated

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:46.890 
that was one of my most anticipated

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.130
