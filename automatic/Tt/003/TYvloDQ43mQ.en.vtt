today on the video so what I'm gonna do

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:09.790 
today on the video so what I'm gonna do
first<00:01:08.390> off<00:01:08.630> is<00:01:08.810> we're<00:01:08.899> going<00:01:08.990> to<00:01:09.049> lower<00:01:09.320> the

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:09.800 
first off is we're going to lower the

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.890 
first off is we're going to lower the
treadmill<00:01:10.250> so<00:01:11.030> she<00:01:11.090> get<00:01:11.390> into<00:01:11.540> it

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
treadmill so she get into it

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.480 
treadmill so she get into it
so<00:01:13.900> we<00:01:14.020> have<00:01:14.140> to<00:01:14.290> put<00:01:14.560> on<00:01:14.680> the<00:01:14.830> compression

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:15.490 
so we have to put on the compression

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:17.359 
so we have to put on the compression
shorts<00:01:15.790> that<00:01:15.909> are<00:01:15.970> made<00:01:16.600> for<00:01:16.869> the<00:01:17.020> treadmill

just have something in pull this up
waist<00:01:23.590> height<00:01:29.070> and<00:01:30.070> then<00:01:30.430> what<00:01:30.610> she'll<00:01:30.759> have

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:30.909 
waist height and then what she'll have

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:33.719 
waist height and then what she'll have
to<00:01:31.030> do<00:01:31.149> is<00:01:31.299> she<00:01:31.420> has<00:01:31.570> to<00:01:31.690> now<00:01:31.810> zip<00:01:32.110> herself<00:01:32.729> into

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:33.729 
to do is she has to now zip herself into

to do is she has to now zip herself into
the<00:01:33.759> apron<00:01:34.330> of<00:01:34.509> the<00:01:34.570> treadmill<00:01:34.869> that's<00:01:35.259> what

00:01:35.399 --> 00:01:35.409 
the apron of the treadmill that's what

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:39.389 
the apron of the treadmill that's what
creates<00:01:35.770> the<00:01:35.890> seal<00:01:37.649> the<00:01:38.649> technology<00:01:39.250> behind

00:01:39.389 --> 00:01:39.399 
creates the seal the technology behind

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:42.090 
creates the seal the technology behind
the<00:01:39.729> treadmill<00:01:40.210> is<00:01:41.049> that<00:01:41.710> it<00:01:41.799> creates

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:42.100 
the treadmill is that it creates

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:44.010 
the treadmill is that it creates
differential<00:01:42.670> air<00:01:42.820> pressure<00:01:43.149> and<00:01:43.299> weighs<00:01:43.780> her

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 
differential air pressure and weighs her

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:46.800 
differential air pressure and weighs her
and<00:01:44.289> calibrates<00:01:44.860> to<00:01:45.759> essentially<00:01:46.330> lift<00:01:46.630> her

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:46.810 
and calibrates to essentially lift her

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:49.380 
and calibrates to essentially lift her
up<00:01:47.159> to<00:01:48.159> whatever<00:01:48.310> certain<00:01:48.819> percentage<00:01:49.210> body

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390 
up to whatever certain percentage body

isn't<00:02:29.940> that<00:02:30.090> kind<00:02:30.270> of<00:02:30.330> thing<00:02:30.540> you<00:02:30.780> literally

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:31.050 
isn't that kind of thing you literally

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.470 
isn't that kind of thing you literally
cannot<00:02:31.410> fall<00:02:31.680> on<00:02:31.860> the<00:02:31.950> trip<00:02:32.160> which<00:02:32.670> is<00:02:32.790> nice<00:02:32.970> so

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
cannot fall on the trip which is nice so

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:34.580 
cannot fall on the trip which is nice so
when<00:02:33.600> you<00:02:33.660> go<00:02:33.720> ahead<00:02:33.840> push<00:02:34.020> starts<00:02:34.350> going<00:02:34.530> to

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:34.590 
when you go ahead push starts going to

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:46.660 
when you go ahead push starts going to
calibrate

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.339 

at<00:02:47.000> this<00:02:47.180> point<00:02:47.360> is<00:02:47.540> the<00:02:47.599> treadmill<00:02:47.990> kills<00:02:48.200> up

00:02:48.339 --> 00:02:48.349 
at this point is the treadmill kills up

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:51.580 
at this point is the treadmill kills up
with<00:02:48.470> air<00:02:48.709> is<00:02:48.740> weighing<00:02:49.190> her<00:02:50.319> so<00:02:51.319> as<00:02:51.440> we're

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:51.590 
with air is weighing her so as we're

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:52.600 
with air is weighing her so as we're
running<00:02:51.800> and<00:02:51.920> walking<00:02:52.010> it's<00:02:52.370> going<00:02:52.489> to<00:02:52.550> be

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:52.610 
running and walking it's going to be

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:55.780 
running and walking it's going to be
based<00:02:52.849> off<00:02:53.120> for<00:02:53.390> initial<00:02:54.050> body<00:02:54.709> weight

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:55.790 
based off for initial body weight

00:02:55.790 --> 00:03:32.340 
based off for initial body weight
body<00:02:56.390> weight<00:02:56.629> percentage<00:02:57.140> or<00:02:57.290> trying<00:02:57.500> to<00:02:57.709> it

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:32.350 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:34.839 

okay<00:03:32.920> so<00:03:32.980> she's<00:03:33.280> now<00:03:33.460> add<00:03:33.700> 100

00:03:34.839 --> 00:03:34.849 
okay so she's now add 100

00:03:34.849 --> 00:03:36.890 
okay so she's now add 100
so<00:03:35.849> the<00:03:35.940> first<00:03:36.150> thing<00:03:36.239> we're<00:03:36.480> going<00:03:36.569> to<00:03:36.629> do<00:03:36.750> is

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:36.900 
so the first thing we're going to do is

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.280 
so the first thing we're going to do is
we're<00:03:37.019> going<00:03:37.110> to

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:49.660 

seventy-five<00:03:40.829> percent

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:49.670 

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:51.280 

on<00:03:49.910> the<00:03:50.000> treadmill<00:03:50.420> and<00:03:50.450> take<00:03:50.900> that<00:03:51.050> to<00:03:51.260> the

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.290 
on the treadmill and take that to the

00:03:51.290 --> 00:04:09.180 
on the treadmill and take that to the
job

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:09.190 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:11.190 

so<00:04:09.790> the<00:04:09.910> treadmill<00:04:10.270> allows<00:04:10.480> for<00:04:10.780> normal

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 
so the treadmill allows for normal

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:13.890 
so the treadmill allows for normal
running<00:04:11.890> mechanics<00:04:12.390> full<00:04:13.390> movement<00:04:13.660> of<00:04:13.870> the

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:13.900 
running mechanics full movement of the

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:16.860 
running mechanics full movement of the

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:16.870 
legs and lower extremities also allows

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:19.259 
legs and lower extremities also allows
the<00:04:17.590> therapists<00:04:18.220> and<00:04:18.340> clinical<00:04:18.760> staff<00:04:19.060> to<00:04:19.239> be

00:04:19.259 --> 00:04:19.269 
the therapists and clinical staff to be

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:20.940 
the therapists and clinical staff to be
able<00:04:19.390> to<00:04:19.600> view<00:04:19.840> make<00:04:20.350> sure<00:04:20.530> they're<00:04:20.680> getting
