00:00:15.549 --> 00:00:19.630
 However in hidden ability you can 

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:21.010
 imagine what hidden skill is and how 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:23.560

 this skill as you can see has a 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.820
 new Japanese that I think is element 

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.560
 winter logo so the winter that 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:49.000
 you have to put in a lovely place 

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:50.410

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.150

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:54.310
 you can see his pokemon fire fight and 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:56.020
 has the hidden skill bold guys 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:57.489
 we are not going to take it to the same 

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:58.750
 grass since we are in town 

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:00.390
 metal and then we will not take it to the 

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:03.060
 first and elba that catch it 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:06.030
 data I do not stop moving 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:08.730

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:11.820
 we removed here we left the menu 

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:13.230
 we go out to the street to boys minimally 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:15.810
 we're going to the right wheel 

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:20.520
 which is the closest just would be a 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:23.450
 brushed snap radical and like a 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.450

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:28.230
 and we have here to embocar guys we are going to 

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:30.500

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:30.500

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:40.630
 you want and others give them to us so that 

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:42.790
 You understand, I also think that it is 

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:45.520

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:47.710

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.480

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:53.320
