00:06:54.950 --> 00:06:54.960 
anti-tank from the red team right now so

00:06:54.960 --> 00:07:01.520 
anti-tank from the red team right now so
I<00:06:55.379> think<00:06:56.129> blue<00:06:56.729> has<00:06:56.969> it<00:06:57.710> as<00:06:58.710> an<00:06:58.949> edge<00:06:59.360> and<00:07:00.530> the

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:01.530 
I think blue has it as an edge and the

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:04.100 
I think blue has it as an edge and the
good<00:07:01.740> thing<00:07:01.979> to<00:07:02.250> look<00:07:02.610> at<00:07:02.729> the<00:07:02.849> VPS<00:07:03.300> blue<00:07:03.960> has

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:04.110 
good thing to look at the VPS blue has

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:06.980 
good thing to look at the VPS blue has
40<00:07:04.699> VP's<00:07:05.699> left<00:07:06.030> and<00:07:06.360> now<00:07:06.509> they're<00:07:06.689> starting<00:07:06.810> to
