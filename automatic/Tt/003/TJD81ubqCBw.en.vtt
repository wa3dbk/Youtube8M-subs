00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.349 
here's the two cucumbers they were moved
separately<00:00:17.789> to<00:00:19.130> five<00:00:20.130> gallon<00:00:20.550> bucket<00:00:21.180> deep

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:21.359 
separately to five gallon bucket deep

00:00:21.359 --> 00:00:24.200 
separately to five gallon bucket deep
water<00:00:21.600> culture<00:00:21.869> systems<00:00:22.880> they've<00:00:23.880> been<00:00:24.060> up

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
water culture systems they've been up

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.929 
water culture systems they've been up
and<00:00:24.359> running<00:00:24.420> now<00:00:24.689> I<00:00:25.260> don't<00:00:26.130> know<00:00:26.400> how<00:00:26.640> long

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:26.939 
and running now I don't know how long

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.029 
and running now I don't know how long
but<00:00:27.539> I<00:00:27.599> moved<00:00:27.900> them<00:00:28.170> from<00:00:28.320> the<00:00:28.470> peppers<00:00:28.859> and<00:00:28.890> as

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:29.039 
but I moved them from the peppers and as

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:31.460 
but I moved them from the peppers and as
you<00:00:29.189> can<00:00:29.340> see<00:00:29.369> they're<00:00:29.670> growing<00:00:30.029> good<00:00:30.470> they're

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470 
you can see they're growing good they're

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:32.780 
you can see they're growing good they're
kind<00:00:31.710> of<00:00:31.769> chasing<00:00:32.219> the<00:00:32.309> light<00:00:32.550> up<00:00:32.759> there

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
kind of chasing the light up there

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.490 
kind of chasing the light up there
that's<00:00:33.270> when<00:00:33.480> my<00:00:33.600> trashcan<00:00:33.870> lights<00:00:34.320> from

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
that's when my trashcan lights from

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.299 
that's when my trashcan lights from
another<00:00:34.710> video<00:00:35.600> but<00:00:36.649> they<00:00:37.649> seem<00:00:37.890> to<00:00:37.920> be<00:00:38.160> doing

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
another video but they seem to be doing

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.030 
another video but they seem to be doing

pollinating hopefully that goes well I
got<00:00:51.059> some<00:00:51.449> small<00:00:52.250> cucumbers<00:00:53.250> that<00:00:53.640> are

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
got some small cucumbers that are

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:58.310 
got some small cucumbers that are
starting<00:00:54.239> to<00:00:54.800> grow<00:00:55.800> here<00:00:56.660> one<00:00:57.660> of<00:00:57.870> them's<00:00:57.989> down

00:00:58.310 --> 00:00:58.320 
starting to grow here one of them's down

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.290 
starting to grow here one of them's down
see<00:00:58.949> if<00:00:58.980> we<00:00:59.129> can<00:00:59.280> see<00:00:59.460> there's<00:00:59.670> one<00:00:59.730> down<00:01:00.090> in

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:00.300 
see if we can see there's one down in

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.139 
see if we can see there's one down in
there<00:01:00.629> small<00:01:01.500> ones<00:01:01.710> starting<00:01:02.039> to<00:01:02.160> go<00:01:02.370> there's

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:07.850 
are the first ones I pollinated

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.420

switch over to Maxie bloom I have them
currently<00:01:25.530> still<00:01:25.740> on<00:01:25.860> Maxie<00:01:26.220> grow<00:01:26.490> but<00:01:26.790> the

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
currently still on Maxie grow but the

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.910 
currently still on Maxie grow but the
next<00:01:27.150> time<00:01:27.210> I<00:01:27.360> change<00:01:27.780> out<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.110> water<00:01:28.350> I'm

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.920 
next time I change out the water I'm

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.469 
next time I change out the water I'm
going<00:01:29.100> to<00:01:29.159> switch<00:01:29.340> him<00:01:29.490> over<00:01:29.549> to<00:01:29.759> Maxie<00:01:30.180> bloom

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:30.479 
going to switch him over to Maxie bloom

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.749 
going to switch him over to Maxie bloom
I<00:01:30.750> was<00:01:31.470> a<00:01:31.500> little<00:01:31.799> concerned<00:01:32.009> with<00:01:32.549> how<00:01:32.700> the

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759 
I was a little concerned with how the

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.819 
I was a little concerned with how the
roots<00:01:33.509> would<00:01:33.750> take<00:01:33.960> because<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.350> plants<00:01:34.740> were

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:34.829 
roots would take because the plants were

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:36.469 
roots would take because the plants were
pretty<00:01:35.130> established<00:01:35.490> in<00:01:35.909> that<00:01:36.060> other<00:01:36.210> deep

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
pretty established in that other deep

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.380 
pretty established in that other deep
water<00:01:36.720> culture<00:01:36.990> system<00:01:37.680> and<00:01:37.920> I<00:01:38.850> was<00:01:39.000> a<00:01:39.030> little

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
water culture system and I was a little

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.780 
water culture system and I was a little
concerned<00:01:39.630> on<00:01:40.320> how<00:01:40.799> well<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.280> roots<00:01:41.549> would

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
concerned on how well the roots would

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.249 
concerned on how well the roots would
take<00:01:42.060> because<00:01:42.240> I<00:01:42.360> kind<00:01:42.509> of<00:01:42.630> just<00:01:42.810> shoved<00:01:43.110> them

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:43.259 
take because I kind of just shoved them

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:44.960 
take because I kind of just shoved them
down<00:01:43.290> in<00:01:43.680> there<00:01:43.860> there<00:01:44.009> was<00:01:44.070> so<00:01:44.369> much<00:01:44.579> roots

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:44.970 
down in there there was so much roots

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.530 
down in there there was so much roots
but<00:01:45.720> let<00:01:45.960> me<00:01:45.990> see<00:01:46.290> if<00:01:46.470> I<00:01:46.619> can<00:01:46.770> do<00:01:46.950> this<00:01:47.540> caught

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
but let me see if I can do this caught

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.600 
but let me see if I can do this caught
up<00:01:48.659> under<00:01:48.960> the<00:01:49.049> lip<00:01:49.229> there<00:01:49.439> there<00:01:49.740> we<00:01:49.860> go<00:01:50.009> you

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
up under the lip there there we go you

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.090 
up under the lip there there we go you
see<00:01:50.850> here<00:01:51.119> it<00:01:51.810> get<00:01:52.140> a<00:01:52.170> little<00:01:52.229> video<00:01:52.590> down<00:01:52.920> in

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
see here it get a little video down in

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.220 
able to see it and then you bring it
over<00:02:52.900> around<00:02:53.470> to<00:02:53.830> a<00:02:54.070> female<00:02:54.459> flower<00:02:55.000> and<00:02:55.780> then

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:56.230 
over around to a female flower and then

00:02:56.230 --> 00:03:00.840 
over around to a female flower and then
you<00:02:56.380> get<00:02:56.560> in<00:02:56.739> there<00:02:56.980> and<00:02:57.180> you<00:02:58.180> just<00:02:58.290> rub<00:02:59.850> her

do<00:03:03.850> that<00:03:04.030> a<00:03:04.060> couple<00:03:04.150> times<00:03:04.450> bounce<00:03:05.020> around<00:03:05.320> and

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:05.590 
do that a couple times bounce around and

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:07.440
