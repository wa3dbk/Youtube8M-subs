okay<00:00:00.359> friends<00:00:01.050> so<00:00:01.709> today<00:00:02.100> we<00:00:02.370> are<00:00:02.520> looking<00:00:02.730> at

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:03.120 
okay friends so today we are looking at

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:08.570 
okay friends so today we are looking at
a<00:00:03.350> dcs<00:00:04.350> range<00:00:05.720> which<00:00:06.720> is<00:00:06.930> a<00:00:06.960> cooktop<00:00:07.890> with<00:00:08.280> an

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:08.580 
a dcs range which is a cooktop with an

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.180 
a dcs range which is a cooktop with an
oven<00:00:08.880> below<00:00:09.480> it<00:00:09.630> and<00:00:10.410> the<00:00:10.740> customers

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
oven below it and the customers

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.039 
oven below it and the customers
complaint<00:00:11.670> is<00:00:11.880> that<00:00:11.910> the<00:00:12.210> oven<00:00:12.750> is<00:00:12.870> not

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:13.049 
complaint is that the oven is not

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.420 
complaint is that the oven is not
functioning<00:00:13.790> we<00:00:15.980> verified<00:00:16.980> that<00:00:17.010> we<00:00:17.279> are

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:17.430 
functioning we verified that we are

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.620 
functioning we verified that we are
getting<00:00:17.730> voltage<00:00:18.529> coming<00:00:19.529> from<00:00:20.010> the<00:00:20.630> oven

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
getting voltage coming from the oven

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.859 
getting voltage coming from the oven
control<00:00:22.369> which<00:00:23.369> is<00:00:23.670> right<00:00:24.150> here

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:24.869 
control which is right here

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:27.230 
control which is right here
you<00:00:25.500> haven't<00:00:25.800> control<00:00:26.130> that's<00:00:26.369> that<00:00:26.970> will

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
you haven't control that's that will

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:31.630 
you haven't control that's that will
send<00:00:27.539> current<00:00:28.380> down<00:00:29.279> to<00:00:29.789> our<00:00:30.359> oven<00:00:30.990> igniter

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:31.640 
send current down to our oven igniter

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:36.380 
send current down to our oven igniter
which<00:00:32.640> is<00:00:34.670> located<00:00:35.670> down<00:00:36.030> there

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
which is located down there

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:49.279 
which is located down there
down<00:00:37.260> at<00:00:37.860> the<00:00:37.890> bottom<00:00:38.100> of<00:00:38.309> the<00:00:38.460> oven<00:00:46.489> and<00:00:48.289> and

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
down at the bottom of the oven and and

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.400 
down at the bottom of the oven and and
when<00:00:49.649> I<00:00:49.680> started<00:00:50.340> up<00:00:50.430> the<00:00:50.610> oven<00:00:50.940> I<00:00:51.320> started<00:00:52.320> to

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
when I started up the oven I started to

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.590 
when I started up the oven I started to
notice<00:00:52.590> that<00:00:52.739> there<00:00:52.920> was<00:00:53.309> current<00:00:54.300> flowing

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
notice that there was current flowing

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.650 
notice that there was current flowing
this<00:00:55.590> is<00:00:55.770> my<00:00:55.949> ant<00:00:56.190> meter<00:00:56.460> i<00:00:56.760> clamp<00:00:57.210> it<00:00:57.360> on<00:00:57.480> to

00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
this is my ant meter i clamp it on to

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.380 
this is my ant meter i clamp it on to
one<00:00:57.870> of<00:00:57.989> my<00:00:58.280> one<00:00:59.280> of<00:00:59.370> the<00:00:59.460> leads<00:00:59.670> going<00:01:00.030> to<00:01:00.270> the

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
one of my one of the leads going to the

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.630 
one of my one of the leads going to the
igniter<00:01:00.690> and<00:01:01.500> if<00:01:01.829> there's<00:01:02.070> current<00:01:02.280> flowing

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
igniter and if there's current flowing

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.020 
igniter and if there's current flowing
this<00:01:03.120> needle<00:01:03.589> will<00:01:04.589> start<00:01:04.979> to<00:01:05.250> deflect<00:01:05.729> and

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
this needle will start to deflect and

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.480 
this needle will start to deflect and
come<00:01:06.210> up<00:01:06.500> anyway<00:01:07.500> the<00:01:07.650> needle<00:01:07.920> started<00:01:08.400> to

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
come up anyway the needle started to

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:14.179 
come up anyway the needle started to
come<00:01:08.700> up<00:01:08.729> and<00:01:10.250> about<00:01:12.140> about<00:01:13.140> 10<00:01:13.530> seconds<00:01:14.010> into

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
come up and about about 10 seconds into

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.219 
come up and about about 10 seconds into
it<00:01:14.490> the<00:01:14.909> needle<00:01:15.210> just<00:01:15.390> suddenly<00:01:15.570> dropped<00:01:15.960> back

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
it the needle just suddenly dropped back

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.580 
it the needle just suddenly dropped back
down<00:01:16.439> to<00:01:16.619> zero<00:01:16.909> so<00:01:17.909> I<00:01:17.939> take<00:01:18.360> out<00:01:18.509> my<00:01:18.590> handy

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
down to zero so I take out my handy

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.749 
down to zero so I take out my handy
dandy<00:01:19.619> voltmeter<00:01:20.520> and<00:01:21.210> I<00:01:22.250> take<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.400> meter<00:01:23.610> and

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
dandy voltmeter and I take the meter and

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:26.690 
dandy voltmeter and I take the meter and
touch<00:01:23.970> it<00:01:24.150> to<00:01:24.270> one<00:01:24.420> of<00:01:24.509> the<00:01:24.600> leads<00:01:24.840> of<00:01:25.080> the<00:01:25.700> of

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:26.700 
touch it to one of the leads of the of

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:29.660 
touch it to one of the leads of the of
the<00:01:27.299> igniter<00:01:27.720> lead<00:01:28.100> nothing's<00:01:29.100> there

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
the igniter lead nothing's there

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.770 
the igniter lead nothing's there
but<00:01:30.659> we<00:01:30.810> are<00:01:30.990> getting<00:01:31.320> something<00:01:31.619> in<00:01:31.950> here<00:01:32.780> so

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
but we are getting something in here so

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.630 
but we are getting something in here so
what<00:01:33.930> that<00:01:33.960> means<00:01:34.320> is<00:01:34.560> that<00:01:34.590> the<00:01:34.890> igniter<00:01:35.369> is

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:35.640 
what that means is that the igniter is

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.210 
what that means is that the igniter is
getting<00:01:36.000> voltage<00:01:36.450> and<00:01:36.930> the<00:01:37.710> igniter<00:01:37.979> has

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
getting voltage and the igniter has

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:41.030 
getting voltage and the igniter has
probably<00:01:38.700> just<00:01:39.030> completely<00:01:40.040> internally

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
probably just completely internally

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.740 
probably just completely internally
failed<00:01:41.310> so<00:01:41.670> it<00:01:41.970> looks<00:01:42.180> as<00:01:42.329> though<00:01:42.360> what<00:01:42.659> he

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
failed so it looks as though what he

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:46.460 
failed so it looks as though what he
needs<00:01:42.960> to<00:01:43.079> have<00:01:43.290> is<00:01:44.159> a<00:01:44.280> new<00:01:44.610> igniter<00:01:45.470> replaced

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
needs to have is a new igniter replaced

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.469 
needs to have is a new igniter replaced
to<00:01:46.799> get<00:01:46.950> him<00:01:47.040> back<00:01:47.189> up<00:01:47.220> and<00:01:47.490> running<00:01:47.670> so<00:01:48.270> we

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
to get him back up and running so we

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.249 
to get him back up and running so we
have<00:01:48.630> got<00:01:48.899> access<00:01:49.590> down<00:01:49.920> to<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.280> igniter<00:01:51.259> this

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:52.259 
have got access down to the igniter this

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:54.380 
have got access down to the igniter this
is<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.829> item<00:01:53.340> that<00:01:53.520> we<00:01:53.640> are<00:01:53.759> probably<00:01:54.000> going

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
is the item that we are probably going

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:56.510 
is the item that we are probably going
to<00:01:54.450> be<00:01:54.540> changing<00:01:55.049> out<00:01:55.200> today<00:01:55.590> I<00:01:55.770> haven't

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
to be changing out today I haven't

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.100 
to be changing out today I haven't
removed<00:01:56.759> it<00:01:57.000> yet<00:01:57.210> but<00:01:57.479> I'm<00:01:57.630> going<00:01:57.930> to

00:01:58.100 --> 00:01:58.110 
removed it yet but I'm going to

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.929 
removed it yet but I'm going to
disconnect<00:01:58.530> it<00:01:58.950> momentarily<00:01:59.430> we're<00:01:59.759> going<00:01:59.880> to

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
disconnect it momentarily we're going to

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.969 
disconnect it momentarily we're going to
omit<00:02:00.149> out<00:02:00.390> and<00:02:00.630> I'm<00:02:00.780> expecting<00:02:01.409> to<00:02:01.530> find<00:02:01.770> that

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
omit out and I'm expecting to find that

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.310 
omit out and I'm expecting to find that
it's<00:02:02.130> probably<00:02:02.369> got<00:02:02.930> infinite<00:02:03.930> resistance

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:04.320 
it's probably got infinite resistance

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.539 
it's probably got infinite resistance
it's<00:02:05.009> probably<00:02:05.579> burned<00:02:05.820> open<00:02:06.210> on<00:02:06.329> the<00:02:06.479> inside

00:02:07.539 --> 00:02:07.549 
it's probably burned open on the inside

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:09.639 
it's probably burned open on the inside
so<00:02:07.850> we'll<00:02:08.119> take<00:02:08.300> a<00:02:08.330> look<00:02:08.539> at<00:02:08.629> that<00:02:08.750> next<00:02:09.379> okay

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
so we'll take a look at that next okay

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:12.280 
so we'll take a look at that next okay
so<00:02:09.709> we're<00:02:10.220> measuring<00:02:10.580> resistance<00:02:11.150> on<00:02:11.750> this

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:12.290 
so we're measuring resistance on this

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.220 
so we're measuring resistance on this
igniter<00:02:12.739> right<00:02:13.220> now<00:02:13.430> got<00:02:14.360> my<00:02:14.510> leads<00:02:14.780> on<00:02:15.019> this

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
igniter right now got my leads on this

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.619 
igniter right now got my leads on this
we're<00:02:15.950> touching<00:02:16.129> into<00:02:16.519> the<00:02:16.640> two<00:02:16.970> two<00:02:17.360> leads

00:02:17.619 --> 00:02:17.629 
we're touching into the two two leads

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:20.800 
we're touching into the two two leads
and<00:02:18.069> looking<00:02:19.069> at<00:02:19.160> my<00:02:19.310> own<00:02:19.340> meter<00:02:19.849> my<00:02:20.660> own

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:20.810 
and looking at my own meter my own

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.479 
and looking at my own meter my own
leaders<00:02:21.200> telling<00:02:21.560> me<00:02:21.680> that<00:02:21.890> the<00:02:22.010> resistance

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:22.489 
leaders telling me that the resistance

00:02:22.489 --> 00:02:29.860 
leaders telling me that the resistance
going<00:02:22.640> through<00:02:22.940> this<00:02:23.090> is<00:02:23.650> about<00:02:27.220> 750,000<00:02:28.220> ohms

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:29.870 
going through this is about 750,000 ohms

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.140 
going through this is about 750,000 ohms
the<00:02:30.470> typical<00:02:30.980> resistance<00:02:31.489> on<00:02:31.670> this<00:02:31.790> should<00:02:32.030> be

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:32.150 
the typical resistance on this should be

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.400 
the typical resistance on this should be
about<00:02:32.450> forty<00:02:33.230> to<00:02:33.260> sixty<00:02:33.830> ohms<00:02:34.220> so<00:02:34.760> at<00:02:35.599> seven

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
about forty to sixty ohms so at seven

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:38.199 
about forty to sixty ohms so at seven
hundred<00:02:36.709> and<00:02:36.860> fifty<00:02:37.370> thousand<00:02:37.790> dollars<00:02:38.030> it's

00:02:38.199 --> 00:02:38.209 
hundred and fifty thousand dollars it's

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:40.630 
hundred and fifty thousand dollars it's
essentially<00:02:38.870> an<00:02:39.019> open<00:02:39.110> circuit<00:02:39.650> at<00:02:40.280> least<00:02:40.430> for

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:40.640 
essentially an open circuit at least for

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:42.789 
essentially an open circuit at least for
all<00:02:40.730> practical<00:02:41.329> concern<00:02:41.720> it's<00:02:41.959> basically

00:02:42.789 --> 00:02:42.799 
all practical concern it's basically

00:02:42.799 --> 00:02:45.940 
all practical concern it's basically
burned<00:02:43.190> open<00:02:43.489> so<00:02:44.360> this<00:02:44.720> is<00:02:44.959> the<00:02:45.140> igniter<00:02:45.470> the

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
burned open so this is the igniter the

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.300 
burned open so this is the igniter the
one<00:02:46.099> that<00:02:46.280> we're<00:02:46.370> going<00:02:46.400> to<00:02:46.579> be<00:02:46.640> replacing

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:48.310 
one that we're going to be replacing

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:51.400 
one that we're going to be replacing
looking<00:02:49.310> at<00:02:49.459> it<00:02:49.640> just<00:02:49.670> a<00:02:49.970> visual<00:02:50.360> inspection<00:02:50.510> I

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
looking at it just a visual inspection I

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:54.339 
looking at it just a visual inspection I
don't<00:02:51.950> see<00:02:52.220> any<00:02:52.370> evidence<00:02:52.519> of<00:02:52.940> any<00:02:53.060> burn<00:02:53.959> marks

00:02:54.339 --> 00:02:54.349 
don't see any evidence of any burn marks

00:02:54.349 --> 00:02:56.410 
don't see any evidence of any burn marks
when<00:02:54.500> a<00:02:54.530> crack<00:02:54.860> marks<00:02:55.250> on<00:02:55.489> the<00:02:55.670> actual<00:02:56.030> igniter

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:56.420 
when a crack marks on the actual igniter

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.240 
when a crack marks on the actual igniter
surface<00:02:57.049> incidentally<00:02:57.709> you<00:02:57.799> should<00:02:57.980> never

00:02:58.240 --> 00:02:58.250 
surface incidentally you should never

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:00.580 
surface incidentally you should never
touch<00:02:58.610> that<00:02:58.880> with<00:02:59.060> your<00:02:59.180> fingers<00:02:59.630> the<00:03:00.349> oil

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
touch that with your fingers the oil

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.830 
touch that with your fingers the oil
finger<00:03:00.950> fingers<00:03:01.310> can<00:03:01.549> create<00:03:01.880> hot<00:03:02.090> spots<00:03:02.120> and

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
finger fingers can create hot spots and

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.759 
finger fingers can create hot spots and
premature<00:03:03.590> failure<00:03:04.160> so<00:03:05.379> anyway<00:03:06.379> there's

00:03:06.759 --> 00:03:06.769 
premature failure so anyway there's

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:08.350 
premature failure so anyway there's
there's<00:03:07.069> no<00:03:07.190> evidence<00:03:07.549> of<00:03:07.700> a<00:03:07.790> burn<00:03:08.030> mark

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:08.360 
there's no evidence of a burn mark

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.509 
there's no evidence of a burn mark
that's<00:03:08.629> inside<00:03:08.989> the<00:03:09.170> igniter<00:03:09.739> so<00:03:10.099> the<00:03:10.310> failure

00:03:10.509 --> 00:03:10.519 
that's inside the igniter so the failure

00:03:10.519 --> 00:03:12.759 
that's inside the igniter so the failure
has<00:03:10.879> occurred<00:03:10.959> somewhere<00:03:11.959> inside<00:03:12.470> this

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:12.769 
has occurred somewhere inside this

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:15.069 
has occurred somewhere inside this
ceramic<00:03:13.130> block<00:03:13.760> and<00:03:14.180> that's<00:03:14.450> where<00:03:14.720> it's<00:03:14.870> gone

00:03:15.069 --> 00:03:15.079 
ceramic block and that's where it's gone

00:03:15.079 --> 00:03:19.120 
ceramic block and that's where it's gone
bad<00:03:15.459> okay<00:03:16.459> so<00:03:16.519> before<00:03:17.299> we<00:03:17.889> install<00:03:18.889> the<00:03:18.920> new

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.130 
bad okay so before we install the new

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:21.220 
bad okay so before we install the new
igniter<00:03:19.609> it's<00:03:19.910> always<00:03:20.209> a<00:03:20.239> good<00:03:20.450> idea<00:03:20.480> to<00:03:21.019> take

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:21.230 
igniter it's always a good idea to take

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:23.620 
igniter it's always a good idea to take
it<00:03:21.290> out<00:03:21.530> of<00:03:21.680> the<00:03:21.739> truck<00:03:22.010> and<00:03:22.239> test<00:03:23.239> it<00:03:23.480> to<00:03:23.600> make

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:23.630 
it out of the truck and test it to make

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:25.539 
it out of the truck and test it to make
sure<00:03:23.810> that<00:03:23.989> it<00:03:24.230> hasn't<00:03:24.410> been<00:03:24.799> damaged<00:03:25.310> from

00:03:25.539 --> 00:03:25.549 
sure that it hasn't been damaged from

00:03:25.549 --> 00:03:28.750 
sure that it hasn't been damaged from
shipment<00:03:26.120> or<00:03:26.450> got<00:03:26.810> bumped<00:03:27.290> or<00:03:27.519> last<00:03:28.519> thing<00:03:28.700> you

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
shipment or got bumped or last thing you

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.220 
shipment or got bumped or last thing you
want<00:03:28.940> to<00:03:28.970> do<00:03:29.120> is<00:03:29.239> take<00:03:29.389> the<00:03:29.540> trouble<00:03:29.750> to<00:03:29.900> put<00:03:30.109> in

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
want to do is take the trouble to put in

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:31.539 
want to do is take the trouble to put in
an<00:03:30.350> ad<00:03:30.440> I<00:03:30.560> normally<00:03:30.950> find<00:03:31.190> out<00:03:31.310> it<00:03:31.400> doesn't

00:03:31.539 --> 00:03:31.549 
an ad I normally find out it doesn't

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:32.770 
an ad I normally find out it doesn't
work<00:03:31.700> have<00:03:32.030> to<00:03:32.120> go<00:03:32.239> to<00:03:32.299> the<00:03:32.359> van<00:03:32.510> and<00:03:32.540> get

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:32.780 
work have to go to the van and get

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:35.440 
work have to go to the van and get
another<00:03:32.959> one<00:03:33.049> but<00:03:34.040> anyway<00:03:34.430> we've<00:03:35.180> got<00:03:35.209> it

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
another one but anyway we've got it

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:37.000 
another one but anyway we've got it
working<00:03:35.660> and<00:03:36.139> we're<00:03:36.380> getting<00:03:36.650> proper

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
working and we're getting proper

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:39.069 
working and we're getting proper
resistance<00:03:37.310> here<00:03:37.790> so<00:03:37.819> this<00:03:38.329> igniter<00:03:38.720> is<00:03:38.900> going

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:39.079 
resistance here so this igniter is going

00:03:39.079 --> 00:03:41.949 
resistance here so this igniter is going
to<00:03:39.139> work<00:03:39.290> just<00:03:39.319> fine<00:03:39.829> okay<00:03:40.540> the<00:03:41.540> new<00:03:41.660> igniter

00:03:41.949 --> 00:03:41.959 
to work just fine okay the new igniter

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:44.740 
to work just fine okay the new igniter
is<00:03:42.260> in<00:03:42.440> place<00:03:42.769> and<00:03:43.180> if<00:03:44.180> you<00:03:44.299> take<00:03:44.510> a<00:03:44.540> look<00:03:44.690> here

00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:44.750 
is in place and if you take a look here

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:46.870 
is in place and if you take a look here
you'll<00:03:45.109> see<00:03:45.380> that<00:03:45.530> igniter<00:03:45.950> is<00:03:46.220> starting<00:03:46.700> to

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:46.880 
you'll see that igniter is starting to

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:51.580 
you'll see that igniter is starting to
glow<00:03:47.410> and<00:03:49.660> looking<00:03:50.660> at<00:03:50.810> the<00:03:50.959> current<00:03:51.319> draw

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:51.590 
glow and looking at the current draw

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:54.009 
glow and looking at the current draw
they<00:03:52.579> connect<00:03:53.150> right<00:03:53.299> now<00:03:53.540> is<00:03:53.750> drawing

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:54.019 
they connect right now is drawing

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:57.460 
they connect right now is drawing
somewhere<00:03:54.590> like<00:03:54.889> around<00:03:55.250> two<00:03:55.730> point<00:03:56.470> eight

00:03:57.460 --> 00:03:57.470 
somewhere like around two point eight

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:00.370 
somewhere like around two point eight
five<00:03:58.069> amperes<00:03:59.000> that's<00:03:59.419> exactly<00:04:00.169> in<00:04:00.290> the

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:00.380 
five amperes that's exactly in the

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:03.190 
five amperes that's exactly in the
ballpark<00:04:00.859> that's<00:04:01.609> what<00:04:01.849> we<00:04:02.000> wanted<00:04:02.389> the

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:03.200 
ballpark that's what we wanted the

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.319 
ballpark that's what we wanted the
safety<00:04:03.769> valve<00:04:03.919> and<00:04:04.220> this<00:04:04.310> is<00:04:04.549> designed<00:04:05.000> to

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:05.329 
safety valve and this is designed to

00:04:05.329 --> 00:04:08.770 
safety valve and this is designed to
open<00:04:05.480> somewhere<00:04:06.109> between<00:04:06.260> about<00:04:06.769> 2.8<00:04:07.579> amps<00:04:08.030> to

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:08.780 
open somewhere between about 2.8 amps to

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:13.479 
open somewhere between about 2.8 amps to
3.2<00:04:09.620> amperes<00:04:10.220> and<00:04:11.440> the<00:04:12.440> safety<00:04:13.069> valve<00:04:13.220> does

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:13.489 
3.2 amperes and the safety valve does

00:04:13.489 --> 00:04:15.520 
3.2 amperes and the safety valve does
have<00:04:13.669> a<00:04:13.700> have<00:04:14.000> a<00:04:14.030> viscous<00:04:14.510> damper<00:04:14.989> takes<00:04:15.349> about

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:15.530 
have a have a viscous damper takes about

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:18.729 
have a have a viscous damper takes about
30<00:04:15.979> or<00:04:16.699> 40<00:04:16.850> seconds<00:04:17.840> for<00:04:18.079> this<00:04:18.199> damper<00:04:18.620> to

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:18.739 
30 or 40 seconds for this damper to

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:20.069 
30 or 40 seconds for this damper to
fully<00:04:18.949> open

00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:20.079 
fully open

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:22.679 
fully open
it<00:04:20.139> opens<00:04:20.409> slowly<00:04:21.060> so<00:04:22.060> that<00:04:22.300> there's<00:04:22.479> no

00:04:22.679 --> 00:04:22.689 
it opens slowly so that there's no

00:04:22.689 --> 00:04:24.540 
it opens slowly so that there's no
sudden<00:04:23.050> explosion<00:04:23.680> to<00:04:23.770> flame<00:04:24.009> but<00:04:24.189> the<00:04:24.310> flame

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:24.550 
sudden explosion to flame but the flame

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:28.140 
sudden explosion to flame but the flame
just<00:04:24.580> kind<00:04:25.000> of<00:04:25.030> comes<00:04:25.270> on<00:04:25.509> gradually<00:04:26.909> so<00:04:27.909> like

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:28.150 
just kind of comes on gradually so like

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:31.890 
just kind of comes on gradually so like
I<00:04:28.270> said<00:04:28.330> it<00:04:28.629> takes<00:04:28.860> about<00:04:29.860> 30<00:04:30.819> to<00:04:30.939> 50<00:04:31.210> seconds

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:31.900 
I said it takes about 30 to 50 seconds

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:34.980 
I said it takes about 30 to 50 seconds
to<00:04:32.139> get<00:04:32.289> come<00:04:32.590> on<00:04:32.740> and<00:04:33.639> have<00:04:34.330> a<00:04:34.419> nice<00:04:34.599> beautiful

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:34.990 
to get come on and have a nice beautiful

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:38.600 
to get come on and have a nice beautiful
flame<00:04:36.419> everything<00:04:37.419> is<00:04:37.509> working<00:04:37.689> just<00:04:37.840> fine

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:38.610 
flame everything is working just fine

00:04:38.610 --> 00:04:41.850 
flame everything is working just fine
let's<00:04:39.610> close<00:04:39.879> it<00:04:40.060> back<00:04:40.210> up<00:04:40.530> okay<00:04:41.530> we're<00:04:41.740> in<00:04:41.770> the

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:41.860 
let's close it back up okay we're in the

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:43.260 
let's close it back up okay we're in the
process<00:04:42.099> of<00:04:42.490> putting<00:04:42.610> it<00:04:42.789> all<00:04:42.909> back<00:04:43.060> together

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:43.270 
process of putting it all back together

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:45.899 
process of putting it all back together
again<00:04:43.599> I<00:04:44.439> thought<00:04:44.949> I'd<00:04:45.159> point<00:04:45.340> out<00:04:45.580> something

00:04:45.899 --> 00:04:45.909 
again I thought I'd point out something

00:04:45.909 --> 00:04:48.270 
again I thought I'd point out something
that<00:04:46.409> something<00:04:47.409> that<00:04:47.560> might<00:04:47.710> be<00:04:48.099> of<00:04:48.189> interest

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:48.280 
that something that might be of interest

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:52.860 
that something that might be of interest
to<00:04:48.669> you<00:04:48.939> folks<00:04:49.180> is<00:04:49.509> the<00:04:50.400> the<00:04:51.400> oven<00:04:52.240> interior

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:52.870 
to you folks is the the oven interior

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:55.770 
to you folks is the the oven interior
lights<00:04:53.169> each<00:04:54.129> one<00:04:54.400> of<00:04:54.490> these<00:04:54.639> I<00:04:54.909> know<00:04:55.629> you

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:55.780 
lights each one of these I know you

00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:57.390 
lights each one of these I know you
can't<00:04:56.050> see<00:04:56.289> it<00:04:56.379> very<00:04:56.440> well<00:04:56.770> because<00:04:56.949> they're

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:57.400 
can't see it very well because they're

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:01.050 
can't see it very well because they're
probably<00:04:57.639> blasting<00:04:58.479> the<00:04:58.930> the<00:04:59.879> aperture<00:05:00.879> on

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:01.060 
probably blasting the the aperture on

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:05.450 
probably blasting the the aperture on
this<00:05:01.240> camera<00:05:01.900> right<00:05:02.050> now<00:05:02.110> but<00:05:03.300> but<00:05:04.300> these

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:05.460 
this camera right now but but these

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:10.800 
this camera right now but but these
lights<00:05:08.849> you<00:05:09.849> know<00:05:09.909> if<00:05:10.090> you<00:05:10.180> can<00:05:10.300> see<00:05:10.509> that<00:05:10.659> any

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:10.810 
lights you know if you can see that any

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:11.580 
lights you know if you can see that any
better<00:05:11.080> or<00:05:11.229> not

00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:11.590 
better or not

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:14.969 
better or not
but<00:05:12.190> it's<00:05:12.400> there's<00:05:12.849> a<00:05:12.909> glass<00:05:13.629> lens<00:05:14.289> that's<00:05:14.710> put

00:05:14.969 --> 00:05:14.979 
but it's there's a glass lens that's put

00:05:14.979 --> 00:05:18.290 
but it's there's a glass lens that's put
over<00:05:15.340> the<00:05:15.690> the<00:05:16.690> 40<00:05:16.990> watt<00:05:17.110> light<00:05:17.379> bulb<00:05:17.680> and

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:18.300 
over the the 40 watt light bulb and

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:21.269 
over the the 40 watt light bulb and
sometimes<00:05:19.300> that<00:05:19.599> lens<00:05:19.930> is<00:05:20.169> particularly<00:05:20.979> hard

00:05:21.269 --> 00:05:21.279 
sometimes that lens is particularly hard

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:24.659 
sometimes that lens is particularly hard
to<00:05:21.490> get<00:05:21.669> off<00:05:21.819> it's<00:05:22.090> just<00:05:22.180> because<00:05:22.689> the<00:05:23.669> baking

00:05:24.659 --> 00:05:24.669 
to get off it's just because the baking

00:05:24.669 --> 00:05:26.430 
to get off it's just because the baking
oils<00:05:25.000> greases<00:05:25.300> and<00:05:25.629> everything<00:05:25.930> else<00:05:26.080> cakes

00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:26.440 
oils greases and everything else cakes

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:28.409 
oils greases and everything else cakes
around<00:05:26.620> it<00:05:27.099> and<00:05:27.279> basically<00:05:28.000> makes<00:05:28.300> it

00:05:28.409 --> 00:05:28.419 
around it and basically makes it

00:05:28.419 --> 00:05:31.379 
around it and basically makes it
difficult<00:05:28.750> to<00:05:29.259> get<00:05:29.650> loose<00:05:29.919> so<00:05:30.759> the<00:05:31.000> easiest

00:05:31.379 --> 00:05:31.389 
difficult to get loose so the easiest

00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:35.189 
difficult to get loose so the easiest
way<00:05:31.629> to<00:05:31.659> do<00:05:31.960> that<00:05:32.169> is<00:05:33.029> is<00:05:34.029> to<00:05:34.449> you<00:05:34.990> know<00:05:35.110> of

00:05:35.189 --> 00:05:35.199 
way to do that is is to you know of

00:05:35.199 --> 00:05:37.589 
way to do that is is to you know of
course<00:05:35.440> wait<00:05:36.219> until<00:05:36.520> the<00:05:36.639> bulb<00:05:36.789> is<00:05:37.000> cool<00:05:37.270> and

00:05:37.589 --> 00:05:37.599 
course wait until the bulb is cool and

00:05:37.599 --> 00:05:40.499 
course wait until the bulb is cool and
take<00:05:38.349> a<00:05:38.379> rubber<00:05:38.710> hammer<00:05:39.009> and<00:05:39.430> with<00:05:40.180> a<00:05:40.210> rubber

00:05:40.499 --> 00:05:40.509 
take a rubber hammer and with a rubber

00:05:40.509 --> 00:05:43.589 
take a rubber hammer and with a rubber
hammer<00:05:40.750> just<00:05:41.169> lightly<00:05:41.500> wrap<00:05:42.069> all<00:05:42.759> away

00:05:43.589 --> 00:05:43.599 
hammer just lightly wrap all away

00:05:43.599 --> 00:05:45.480 
hammer just lightly wrap all away
all<00:05:43.750> the<00:05:43.930> way<00:05:44.020> around<00:05:44.440> this<00:05:44.889> bulb<00:05:45.250> while

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:45.490 
all the way around this bulb while

00:05:45.490 --> 00:05:48.209 
all the way around this bulb while
applying<00:05:45.819> a<00:05:46.150> twisting<00:05:46.599> force<00:05:46.870> and<00:05:47.500> after

00:05:48.209 --> 00:05:48.219 
applying a twisting force and after

00:05:48.219 --> 00:05:50.010 
applying a twisting force and after
about<00:05:48.430> a<00:05:48.490> minute<00:05:48.849> or<00:05:48.940> so<00:05:49.120> it'll<00:05:49.389> find<00:05:49.659> a<00:05:49.779> give

00:05:50.010 --> 00:05:50.020 
about a minute or so it'll find a give

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:54.450 
about a minute or so it'll find a give
and<00:05:50.289> come<00:05:51.129> loose<00:05:51.339> for<00:05:51.639> you<00:05:52.379> okay<00:05:53.379> and<00:05:53.710> so<00:05:54.009> our

customers dcs high-quality range is back
up<00:06:00.310> and<00:06:00.460> running<00:06:00.580> again<00:06:01.469> the<00:06:04.259> is<00:06:05.259> working

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:05.860 
up and running again the is working

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:07.920 
up and running again the is working
properly<00:06:06.039> I<00:06:06.520> don't<00:06:07.300> know<00:06:07.389> if<00:06:07.479> you<00:06:07.539> can<00:06:07.719> hear<00:06:07.900> it

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:07.930 
properly I don't know if you can hear it

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:09.839 
properly I don't know if you can hear it
or<00:06:08.080> not<00:06:08.110> but<00:06:08.229> the<00:06:08.770> flame<00:06:09.039> is<00:06:09.250> definitely<00:06:09.669> going

00:06:09.839 --> 00:06:09.849 
or not but the flame is definitely going

00:06:09.849 --> 00:06:12.570 
or not but the flame is definitely going
in<00:06:10.089> it<00:06:10.240> is<00:06:10.360> in<00:06:10.539> the<00:06:10.599> process<00:06:10.810> of<00:06:11.169> warming<00:06:11.529> up<00:06:11.680> so

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:12.580 
in it is in the process of warming up so

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:14.700 
in it is in the process of warming up so
all<00:06:13.029> that<00:06:13.210> was<00:06:13.569> really<00:06:13.779> wrong<00:06:14.110> with<00:06:14.319> this<00:06:14.469> was

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:14.710 
all that was really wrong with this was

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:16.680 
all that was really wrong with this was
just<00:06:15.039> had<00:06:15.190> a<00:06:15.219> burned<00:06:15.550> on<00:06:15.729> igniter<00:06:16.120> which<00:06:16.479> is

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:16.690 
just had a burned on igniter which is

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:19.290 
just had a burned on igniter which is
actually<00:06:17.139> a<00:06:17.169> pretty<00:06:17.440> common<00:06:17.919> occurrence<00:06:18.300> on

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:19.300 
actually a pretty common occurrence on

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:23.339 
actually a pretty common occurrence on
many<00:06:19.800> gas<00:06:20.800> ovens
