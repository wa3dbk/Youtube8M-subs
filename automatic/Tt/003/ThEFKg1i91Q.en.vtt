00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:19.369 
ended up installing it on this end which

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:21.849 
ended up installing it on this end which
meant<00:00:19.669> it<00:00:19.880> was<00:00:19.939> inside<00:00:20.810> out<00:00:21.109> and<00:00:21.380> when<00:00:21.589> he<00:00:21.679> told

00:00:21.849 --> 00:00:21.859

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:47.150 
right into the foam adhesive and then

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:49.120 
right into the foam adhesive and then
just<00:00:47.420> peel<00:00:47.660> it<00:00:47.720> up<00:00:47.960> and<00:00:48.230> it<00:00:48.410> will<00:00:48.500> come<00:00:48.710> off<00:00:48.890> no
