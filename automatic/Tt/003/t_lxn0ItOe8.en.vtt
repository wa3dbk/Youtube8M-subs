hey guys John V from bone winning here
you're<00:00:05.490> watching<00:00:05.940> our<00:00:06.089> video<00:00:06.390> review<00:00:06.899> of<00:00:07.109> the

00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:07.830 
you're watching our video review of the

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.509 
you're watching our video review of the
iPad<00:00:08.280> Mini<00:00:08.309> 3<00:00:08.610> the<00:00:09.300> trend<00:00:09.599> is<00:00:09.840> that<00:00:09.900> the<00:00:10.889> iPad

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
iPad Mini 3 the trend is that the iPad

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:13.700 
iPad Mini 3 the trend is that the iPad
gets<00:00:11.880> some<00:00:12.240> new<00:00:12.540> hardware<00:00:13.200> with<00:00:13.500> each

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
gets some new hardware with each

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.310 
gets some new hardware with each
successive<00:00:14.460> device<00:00:15.059> but<00:00:15.570> with<00:00:15.780> this<00:00:15.960> year

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
successive device but with this year

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.680 
successive device but with this year
with<00:00:16.590> the<00:00:16.680> iPad<00:00:17.070> Mini<00:00:17.310> 3<00:00:17.400> it's<00:00:18.240> a<00:00:18.270> little<00:00:18.539> bit

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
with the iPad Mini 3 it's a little bit

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.240 
with the iPad Mini 3 it's a little bit
strange<00:00:19.140> because<00:00:19.439> the<00:00:19.800> only<00:00:20.070> new<00:00:20.220> addition

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
strange because the only new addition

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.060 
strange because the only new addition
here<00:00:20.910> is<00:00:21.119> a<00:00:21.180> touch<00:00:21.660> ID<00:00:21.930> fingerprint<00:00:22.619> sensor

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
here is a touch ID fingerprint sensor

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.070 
here is a touch ID fingerprint sensor
well<00:00:23.670> there's<00:00:23.789> certainly<00:00:24.029> nothing<00:00:24.240> new<00:00:24.810> with

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
well there's certainly nothing new with

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.290 
well there's certainly nothing new with
the<00:00:25.199> design<00:00:25.500> here<00:00:26.010> it's<00:00:26.160> identical<00:00:26.670> to<00:00:27.090> its

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
the design here it's identical to its

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.689 
the design here it's identical to its
predecessor<00:00:28.170> so<00:00:28.619> in<00:00:28.920> terms<00:00:29.189> of<00:00:29.400> its<00:00:29.519> overall

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:29.699 
predecessor so in terms of its overall

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:32.690 
predecessor so in terms of its overall
size<00:00:30.210> weight<00:00:30.869> and<00:00:31.109> thickness<00:00:31.700> nothing

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:32.700 
size weight and thickness nothing

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:35.810 
size weight and thickness nothing
different<00:00:33.239> about<00:00:33.750> it<00:00:34.140> despite<00:00:34.950> that<00:00:35.100> it<00:00:35.430> still

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
different about it despite that it still

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.110 
different about it despite that it still
is<00:00:36.090> a<00:00:36.390> premium<00:00:37.079> tablet<00:00:37.430> compact<00:00:38.430> and<00:00:38.670> has<00:00:39.059> a

is a premium tablet compact and has a
solid<00:00:39.540> construction<00:00:40.079> thanks<00:00:40.950> to<00:00:41.160> its

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
solid construction thanks to its

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.000 
solid construction thanks to its
aluminum<00:00:42.120> body

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:43.010 
aluminum body

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.799 
aluminum body
well<00:00:44.010> there's<00:00:44.160> technically<00:00:44.610> one<00:00:45.090> new<00:00:45.360> change

00:00:45.799 --> 00:00:45.809 
well there's technically one new change

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:47.990 
well there's technically one new change
with<00:00:46.110> its<00:00:46.289> design<00:00:46.530> it's<00:00:47.070> related<00:00:47.430> to<00:00:47.489> the<00:00:47.700> home

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:48.000 
with its design it's related to the home

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.360 
with its design it's related to the home
button<00:00:48.390> it<00:00:48.690> now<00:00:48.870> incorporates<00:00:49.500> that<00:00:49.710> touch<00:00:50.039> ID

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
button it now incorporates that touch ID

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.000 
button it now incorporates that touch ID
fingerprint<00:00:51.149> sensor<00:00:51.719> which<00:00:52.320> is<00:00:52.350> nice<00:00:52.770> because

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010 
fingerprint sensor which is nice because

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.340 
fingerprint sensor which is nice because
it's<00:00:53.309> an<00:00:53.520> alternative<00:00:54.180> way<00:00:54.360> of<00:00:54.390> unlocking<00:00:55.199> the

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
it's an alternative way of unlocking the

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.889 
it's an alternative way of unlocking the
device<00:00:55.620> and<00:00:55.920> you<00:00:55.980> have<00:00:56.550> support<00:00:57.090> for<00:00:57.390> Apple

pay as well so we're going to the same

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.119 
pay as well so we're going to the same
display<00:01:01.230> from<00:01:01.530> before<00:01:02.160> that's<00:01:02.670> a<00:01:02.930> 7.9<00:01:03.930> inch

00:01:04.119 --> 00:01:04.129 
display from before that's a 7.9 inch

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:07.969 
display from before that's a 7.9 inch
2048<00:01:05.129> by<00:01:05.309> 1536<00:01:05.869> Retina<00:01:06.869> display<00:01:07.290> so<00:01:07.950> the

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
2048 by 1536 Retina display so the

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.039 
2048 by 1536 Retina display so the
details<00:01:08.610> are<00:01:08.760> nice<00:01:09.000> thanks<00:01:09.450> to<00:01:09.570> its<00:01:09.689> pixel

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
details are nice thanks to its pixel

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.550 
details are nice thanks to its pixel
density<00:01:10.439> counter<00:01:10.939> 326<00:01:11.939> pixels<00:01:12.240> per<00:01:12.720> inch<00:01:12.750> so

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
density counter 326 pixels per inch so

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.380 
density counter 326 pixels per inch so
you<00:01:13.590> get<00:01:13.740> some<00:01:13.890> crisp<00:01:14.280> looking<00:01:14.670> details<00:01:15.180> so

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
you get some crisp looking details so

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.179 
you get some crisp looking details so
nothing<00:01:15.659> different<00:01:15.810> about<00:01:15.960> that<00:01:16.320> at<00:01:16.650> same

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
nothing different about that at same

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.710 
nothing different about that at same
time<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:17.640> exhibit<00:01:18.000> it's<00:01:18.090> pretty<00:01:18.360> much<00:01:18.479> the

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
time the exhibit it's pretty much the

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.410 
time the exhibit it's pretty much the
same<00:01:19.080> characteristics<00:01:20.070> from<00:01:20.310> before<00:01:20.850> you

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
same characteristics from before you

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.480 
same characteristics from before you
have<00:01:21.689> a<00:01:21.960> solid<00:01:22.320> improved<00:01:22.740> color<00:01:22.950> temperature

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
have a solid improved color temperature

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.660 
have a solid improved color temperature
of<00:01:23.520> six-thousand<00:01:24.360> 656<00:01:25.290> kelvins<00:01:25.890> you<00:01:26.549> have

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
of six-thousand 656 kelvins you have

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.370 
of six-thousand 656 kelvins you have
also<00:01:27.030> pretty<00:01:27.270> much<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.630> same<00:01:27.960> color

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
also pretty much the same color

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.200 
also pretty much the same color
reproduction<00:01:29.040> from<00:01:29.189> before<00:01:29.579> it's<00:01:30.030> not

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210 
reproduction from before it's not

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.120 
reproduction from before it's not
totally<00:01:30.689> accurate<00:01:30.900> just<00:01:31.560> because<00:01:31.799> you<00:01:31.920> get<00:01:32.070> a

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
totally accurate just because you get a

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.950 
totally accurate just because you get a
little<00:01:32.460> bit<00:01:32.579> of<00:01:32.759> saturation<00:01:33.000> with<00:01:33.600> it<00:01:33.750> but

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
little bit of saturation with it but

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.440 
little bit of saturation with it but
still<00:01:34.170> a<00:01:34.409> delightful<00:01:35.189> treat<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:36.000> only<00:01:36.240> weird

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450 
still a delightful treat the only weird

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.289 
still a delightful treat the only weird
thing<00:01:36.689> here<00:01:36.900> is<00:01:37.020> just<00:01:37.320> the<00:01:37.590> brightness<00:01:38.490> output

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
thing here is just the brightness output

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:42.590 
thing here is just the brightness output
now<00:01:39.570> after<00:01:39.990> smile<00:01:40.259> produce<00:01:40.670> 415<00:01:41.670> it's<00:01:41.939> which

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
now after smile produce 415 it's which

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:44.719 
now after smile produce 415 it's which
is<00:01:42.750> pretty<00:01:42.930> good<00:01:43.140> but<00:01:43.590> this<00:01:43.740> time<00:01:43.920> around<00:01:44.280> it's

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
is pretty good but this time around it's

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.510 
is pretty good but this time around it's
dropped<00:01:45.030> down<00:01:45.210> considerably<00:01:45.780> to<00:01:46.320> 312<00:01:47.189> nits

because like last year it produces the
same<00:04:13.579> results<00:04:14.060> here<00:04:14.419> so<00:04:14.690> you<00:04:14.810> get<00:04:15.079> some

00:04:15.339 --> 00:04:15.349 
same results here so you get some

even<00:04:19.849> proper<00:04:20.419> exposure<00:04:21.039> indoors<00:04:22.039> we're

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:22.370 
even proper exposure indoors we're

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:24.370 
even proper exposure indoors we're
letting<00:04:22.729> sparse<00:04:23.180> you<00:04:23.570> tend<00:04:24.140> to

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:29.270 
appear more washed out at the same time

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:31.390 
appear more washed out at the same time
you<00:04:29.540> get<00:04:29.810> pretty<00:04:30.170> much<00:04:30.230> the<00:04:30.410> same<00:04:30.800> qualities

00:04:31.390 --> 00:04:31.400 
you get pretty much the same qualities

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.540 
you get pretty much the same qualities
with<00:04:31.610> its<00:04:31.760> 1080p<00:04:32.660> video<00:04:33.200> recording<00:04:33.550> qualities

so<00:04:35.000> it's<00:04:35.270> more<00:04:35.480> than<00:04:35.600> usable<00:04:36.020> the<00:04:36.590> low

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:36.860 
so it's more than usable the low

so it's more than usable the low
