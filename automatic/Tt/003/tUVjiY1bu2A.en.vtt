00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:13.259
 hi friends my name is Eugene 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:15.179
 sparrows it's not she will pass and the power 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:18.690
 today we are going to analyze you 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:20.390
 four three and two and start with 

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.539
 busting foursome first thing you need 

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:24.810
 original 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:27.029
 here is this part of the palm put on 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.730
 wooden coaster so that the hand does not 

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.929
 then I walked over the big toe 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.620
 must be equal 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:37.190
 warmed bass strings 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.890
 finger lay on the third string 

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:42.180
 middle finger on the second string and 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:45.809
 ring finger respectively first 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:49.640
 the fingers should not be together 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:54.000
 there should be a rookery in this way 

00:00:49.640 --> 00:01:01.770
 we start the algorithm is very simple we take 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:03.010
 just about jerking bass string 3 string 1 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:08.830
 2 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:11.680
 3 you 3 1 2 together 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:15.750
 before you 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:17.540
 3 1 2 place these 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:23.960
 bass 

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:29.090
 3 1 2 place 3 then change ok you 

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:34.430
 3 pen 2 place 3 bases third 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:40.820
 1 place the third world Omakor you 3 1 2 

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:43.659
 together 3 1 3 1 2 revenge at a fast pace 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:43.659
 you will succeed 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.780
 basically nothing difficult and turn 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:05.310
 to search 

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:08.380
 threesome is also called the waltz fight 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.300
 plucked bout because with this we 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:15.480
 make three strings together 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:15.480
 It turns out as a tweaking effect. 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:22.840
 just very laid his hand on the wooden 

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:27.270
 base stand thumb thumb can 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:30.400
 be equal imposed on the country's mass 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:33.730
 same index finger on 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:37.180
 the third middle finger into the second and 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:43.110
 ring finger on white and start 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:43.110
 do the bass 1 2 3 2 times together 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:03:11.530
 changing you 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 3 2 1 1 1 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:22.170
 1 1 1 1 1 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:22.170
 maz me 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:30.580
 in principle, too, nothing complicated and 

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:34.660
 too much but it is also too much plucked battle 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:37.920
 in general, the same story of the group 

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:43.120
 We possess so I have said before, and 

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:44.580
 search this place start bass pirate 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:50.770
 parent 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:53.740
 bass pirates bases and crush us 

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:57.220
 pirate wipe us 

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:58.260
 Bernadette first time filled 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:05.599
 you 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:13.260
 again you perro de mas 1 database record 

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:15.659
 and together with what are friends this lesson 

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:18.299
 came to an end thank you so much for 

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:20.070
 viewing I hope I helped you if you have 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:20.910
 any questions please contact personal 

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:23.580
 messages 

00:04:20.910 --> 00:04:25.560
 write in the comments that is not clear 

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:27.510
 I will definitely explain 

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.990
 some more leg video 

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:30.180
 take off 

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:32.550
 also light you see this video here 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:35.639
 there are two more busting sixes eight 

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:37.650
 you learn their principle will know already 

00:04:35.639 --> 00:04:42.330
 all possible brute force and which 

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:43.460
 there is a simple game of course it is not 

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:47.699
 finger stall 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:48.800
 brute force fits us and this is the base base 

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:52.350
 of knowledge 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:54.750
 the most basic but if he likes the video 

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:57.180
 like subscribe to my channel 

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:59.520
 write your comments 

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:01.949
 why add more than 100 because 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:04.470
