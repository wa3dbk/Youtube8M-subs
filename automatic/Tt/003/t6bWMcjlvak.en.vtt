 teacher was from 1979 that I 

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:32.529
 I received in 1975, the normal one was the 

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:35.920
 only career that I had the 

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:39.250
 possibility of developing my son 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:42.700
 fully when my son is born who 

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:46.360
 has down syndrome miguel is called 

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:51.120

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:56.050
 and make a school and already in 1985 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:59.559
 we got this school 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:02.260

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:04.570
 but just as my son was cared for and 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.250
 They continue serving children with 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:08.830
 special educational needs of 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.680
 municipality and we can say that maybe 

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:14.400

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:20.050
 and seeing children because I've seen 

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:22.390
 how they grow I have seen how they develop 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:24.040
 I have seen what they are capable of doing and 

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:26.050
 children that are being looked after here 

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:29.830
 by teachers trained by teachers 

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:32.259
 that they love them for teachers who have 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:34.899
 gone to study have gone to congresses 

00:01:32.259 --> 00:01:37.410
 they have gone to everything to be better teachers 

00:01:34.899 --> 00:01:37.410
 every day 

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:44.780
 the career of the Teresita teacher has 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:47.480
 been interesting and incessant has always 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:49.340
 been committed to the attention to 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:52.170
 people with disabilities because 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:55.770
 she 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:58.380
 She was the mother of a child with disabilities 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:02.100
 mickey who had the down syndrome already 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.360
 a few years ago he died but 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.710
 she has always been a teacher 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.760
 committed both in the field 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:10.010
 educational as in the social field 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:12.470
 and has left its mark within the 

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:15.230
 institutions where she makes and with 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:17.420
 the people with whom she shares I have 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:20.180
 said many times that if my son Miguel 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:23.330
 they would not have been born I would not have 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:25.520
 found this this line that I 

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:29.030
 it fills so much but he forces me to enter 

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:31.580
 to the magisterium and then there he finds 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:34.490
 another world in a wonderful world a 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:37.310
 world of wonderful boys and that 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:40.090
 we spoil or we move forward and 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:43.230
 that all depends on the teacher 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.230
 a good our 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.970
 the relationship I have with the teacher 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:53.670
 Teresita, that's my teacher, I'm an adviser. 

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.739
 working at campus pink school 

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:58.650
 blue she is the one who is guiding my 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:01.440
 work process that knows a lot about the 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:03.330
 medium known work a lot with the 

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:06.300

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:11.850

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:24.230

 manage that is here for you in everything 

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:30.180
 what interests me more in this 

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:33.660
 final moment is precisely that they are 

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:35.550
 master teachers throughout the extension 

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:38.460
 of the word I with my students 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:41.790
 I ask a lot very much that they see that they can 

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:44.580
 take your students and also as 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:46.770
 could influence the family so that 

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:49.050

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:53.090

 It is always updated as it leaves us 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:14.239
 experience not being afraid to face 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:17.690
 any challenge but it's always there 

00:04:14.239 --> 00:04:21.380
 to motivate us to tell us more or 

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:23.479
 less where do not limit ourselves to 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:27.590
 do things if I can something 

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:30.199
 leave because I want to do not want 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:32.620
 do and that's why I like to be in these 

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:35.560

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:13.860
