00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:05.009
 4-wheel holidays are on trend 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.620
 and for many means the big one 

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:09.740
 Freedom in MÃ¼nsterland has been going on for 60 years 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:12.929
 years camper and camper produced 

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:14.700
 45 to 100000 euro costs the rolling 

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.039
 living room and everything starts with the 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.289
 design 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:21.150
 First there is an idea with this idea 

00:00:19.289 --> 00:00:23.609
 Let's go to a designer we work 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:25.140
 with external design agencies together this 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.279
 Designer will be briefed by us 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.470
 our requirements we to the 

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:30.449
 new product have the designer is coming 

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.880
 with suggestions back we see these 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.870
 Suggestions here on the table 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.059
 she has enforced this suggestion 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.059
 because it's so nice to book front 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:40.920
 and b because it works well 

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:42.870
 The idea is at the computer as 3d 

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:44.700
 drawing means that means each one 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.469
 detail is already planned exactly 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.329
 after the design phase starts 

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:50.370
 Prototyping Everything is checked here 

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.329
 and decided if the vehicles so in 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.320
 series can go 

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.750
 small errors are corrected immediately 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.890
 complete mask adjusted once 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.750
 that's actually the most exciting for us 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.190
 moment you can see now after 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:05.070
 About three months development time 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.360
 if this really fits the vehicle from 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.770
 It may be a bit too 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.820
 too tight is that we have a lot of something too 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.590
 still need to correct 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.860
 that's what this department is about 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:16.049
 determine after the so-called clock 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:17.159
 prototype all tests may have passed 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.229
 he goes into series 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.689
 to be the chance of it daily 

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.759
 Italy delivered in the assembly hall 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:25.799
 the frame for the homo bi construction 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.650
 prepared for the frame construction 

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:30.420
 applied glue and the prefabricated 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:33.060
 undercut and screwed on 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:36.710
 then it is already fixed 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:39.930
 next station in the production line 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:42.750
 67 days on such a mobile home in the 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:44.520
 the most diverse processes are the 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:47.549
 complete construction work done until 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.780
 towards the last finish before the construction 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.060
 The items will begin 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.070
 made the starting shot coincides 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.960
 an xps disk that is 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.909
 highly compressed styrofoam 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.440
 The polystyrene hard foam is used for the 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.330
 side walls the roof and in the ground 

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.610
 used with the water jet 

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:04.470
 cutting system professionally tailored 

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.780
 The water jet has a pressure of 

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.880
 6000 bar under right exit 

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:09.840
 speeds of up to 1000 meters 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.850
 in seconds 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:15.090
 the cut parts come 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:17.239
 Longlife now lasts like this 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:20.010
 Technology is the magic word here 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:21.989
 long live the energy sums up several 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.420
 innovative product features together 

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:26.819
 once the lightweight construction we build ours 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:28.320
 Vehicles light and stable on and 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:29.220
 grant higher prices to our customers 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.830
 cable values 

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.900
 the second is that we go through the long 

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:36.480
 live technology construction our roofs 

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:39.150
 and our floors with gfk protect that 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.980
 is protection against hail impact but also 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.380
 at the same time protection against underbody 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.300
 damages like a puzzle 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.130
 are the side mounting the 

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:49.590
 precisely cut insulating mats 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:51.840
 gap freely placed in the rib 

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.550
 wooden slats will afford polyurethanes 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.260
 it uses no moisture 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:57.900
 record and not work 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:03:00.840
 the efforts ensure stability 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.370
 and torsion stiffness afterwards 

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:05.070
 the gfk abroad for the assembly 

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.600
 that means it is designed 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:08.760
 and with glue 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:11.100
 the finished insulating layer with easy 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:13.049
 hung up and pressed firmly now missing 

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:14.940
 only the inner wall is also for this 

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:17.100
 the special glue applied and the 

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:18.450
 you plates hung up in the press 

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.610
 the walls will be 100 bar 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:22.130
 pressed together 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:24.720
 the next station is that 

00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:26.400
 computer controlled drilling and vrees portal 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:28.440
 here are windows and openings 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:31.230
 Cut out on the roof, for example 

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:33.420
 the roof hatch milled out after the 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:35.820
 Cleaning is the camper roof finished 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.680
 for the assembly road with the light 

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:41.370
 Construction is the company exactly in the 

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:44.460
 trend has given way to weight savings 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:46.620
 is wood free constructions that is the 

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:48.270
 Customers would like to have the vehicles 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.709
 can not rot which are easy 

00:03:48.270 --> 00:03:51.540
 that you can take as much as possible 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:53.340
 as many listeners can build on 

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.810
 as many people can take 

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:57.680
 and always below three and a half tons 

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:59.700
 stay at the same time be next door 

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:01.410
 ie lightweight construction materials 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:03.720
 closet doors and other furniture parts 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:05.880
 prefabricated the edges resp 

00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:07.440
 Cutting surfaces are glued like that 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:09.209
 said online cover the 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:11.700
 face and protect the wood from 

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:13.620
 Moisture will be in the hall next door 

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:15.420
 already the kitchen pre-assembled kit 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:17.250
 the employees get out of the warehouse 

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:20.310
 we will play in closets and 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:23.810
 cable sets stored the preliminary work 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:24.990
 is that they were to listen 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:27.750
 compile 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:30.960
 bring in a commissioned zone 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:33.150
 picked by davids fine and in 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:35.100
 the production is spent so now 

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:37.590
 everything is prepared and the chassis can 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:38.220
 in the production line the construction can 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:40.560
 begin 

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:42.900
 unlike in car production 

00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:45.030
 here almost all handcrafted the camper 

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:46.800
 is assembled like a kit 

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:48.330
 Electrician locksmith and joiner 

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.580
 work hand in hand 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:54.740
 Robot does not exist anyway 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:54.740
 Precision asked every part must sit 

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:03.600
 a vehicle always produces in 

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:05.850
 every step of the way was taken by each employee 

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:08.700
 has a specific work package that he 

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:10.980
 in this time has to fulfill the 

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:12.690
 Construction works from the inside out 

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:15.000
 that is to be in the bottom plate 

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:17.550
 First of all lines laid electricity gas 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.020
 water and heating pipes next 

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:21.030
 All the interior parts of the furniture become 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:22.950
 built in and also the prefabricated kitchen 

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:24.560
 then install that 

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:27.390
 prefabricated and self- produced 

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:29.610
 outside walls set after 70 minutes 

00:05:27.390 --> 00:05:30.870
 the semi-finished mobile home will be ten 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:34.610
 meter further to the next station 

00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:37.050
 rolled there to the bed and the roof 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:39.270
 First , the pages with man power 

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:41.130
 for fees and screwed on before that 

00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:43.590
 roof is used accurately 

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:44.880
 this is about every millimeter it needs 

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:47.490
 every handgrip is sitting 

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:49.470
 now only the front mask is missing 

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:51.770
 face special requests are called 

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:53.730
 By the way, allowed 

00:05:51.770 --> 00:05:56.120
 that goes so far as we can for 

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:59.220
 Dog friends special solutions 

00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:01.350
 but we also have to 

00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:03.780
 example for the roman museum in bad 

00:06:01.350 --> 00:06:06.000
 waldsee a fun mobile built with slide 

00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:07.850
 and bubble bath are also such wishes 

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.320
 realized in our car 

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:12.600
 after the production line follows the 

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:14.100
 Acceptance after a checklist was the 

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:15.470
 Final inspection will be after that 

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:17.790
 smallest mistakes wanted 

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:20.100
 will be produced only on order four 

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:22.410
 outdoors in the year when the camper 

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:24.780
 the finish has finished it is done 

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:28.220
 for Europe-wide extradition and wife 

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:28.220
 Holidays can begin
