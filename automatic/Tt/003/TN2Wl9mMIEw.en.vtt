00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:06.140
 Hello, how are we welcome to 

00:00:02.929 --> 00:00:08.240
 another episode of fire red pokemon that 

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:10.009
 this is not a point worth for those 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.530
 that you have seen the episode number 6 of 

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:14.809
 pokemon red fire vale I bring you the 

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:17.689
 show as I said of how in 

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:21.710
 pokemon pikachu in the yellow edition 

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:23.630
 for game boy you could hunt me without 

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:27.650
 any kind of 

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:29.840
 codes or chips or dates the only 

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:31.699
 condition is the following is worth this 

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:33.320
 coach that is here and hiding in 

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:36.410
 the weeds can not have fought 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:38.899
 against him and also this one that I 'm going to 

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.190
 teach next you will also not have 

00:00:38.899 --> 00:00:42.079
 been able to fight against him you have to 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:43.220
 leave them without fighting against them 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:44.510
 you have to pass them 

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:47.180
 obviously you have to go through 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:49.280
 them because to get the pokemon 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.199
 what do we need that is an abra you have 

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.940
 that will come together build worth so that the 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:55.370
 policeman who is in the house where he has 

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:58.010
 stolen the team rocket be part this is 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:00.019
 the child the young man against whom you can not 

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.190
 fight is worth then I explain to you how 

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:04.260
 the trick in question works 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:07.350
 it's very simple, what happens is that 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.509
 may require several attempts can be 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.250
 fail sometime if you are not agile 

00:01:09.509 --> 00:01:13.020
 with the maneuvers it is worth having 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.909
 calculate here more or less the coach 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.200
 if you notice that we are here he does not see us 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.690
 but if we take one more step 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.850
 sorry if we take one more step now 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:22.280
 would see truth really well then what 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.640
 we have to do is put ourselves here 

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:27.890
 we insure such here 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:31.310
 and just before we get caught we have 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:33.740
 what to give pau is worth so you see 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.180
 then we go to pokemon and with it there will be 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.369
 that we have hunted here I call him 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:39.320
 tricks we use teleportation and 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:40.909
 today to know that the coach is trying 

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.400
 stop but we have already 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:45.320
 transported returns to the last center 

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:47.420
 because with it is tells us the 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.920
 coach who wants to fight but 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.960
 we no longer aspire 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.030
 now when we go back to the pokemon center 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.340
 the start button is completely 

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.170
 uninhabited ok I do not know if there was the 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:59.720
 joystick am I'm giving you the 

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.979
 command but the start does not work is worth 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.770
 what we have to do now is raise a 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:05.630
 more time for the bridge nugget my god 

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.580
 these graphics are deadly this 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:10.310
 go to the safe view 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.900
 and when going back up the bridge nugget 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:15.290
 we have to go for the coach that 

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:18.260
 I said prior to the child who has a 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:20.069
 group of level 17 if I remember correctly if 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.329
 level 17 

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:23.849
 and all we have to do is 

00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:25.230
 sell him though so that this 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:27.180
 work because sometimes it turns to 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.459
 we have to leave a space between him and 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.859
 I'm worth to walk towards us 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:34.379
 then we let him catch us and 

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:35.519
 we fight against him is worth what I said 

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:37.560
 that it's very funny that I talk about him 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:39.510
 that anne for the myth of me and the truck 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.780
 well I told you about pokemon red fire 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:44.639
 episode 6 I will not repeat it worth it then 

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:47.189
 nothing we are going to give the quick voucher and 

00:02:44.639 --> 00:02:48.959
 We're going to beat him at full speed because 

00:02:47.189 --> 00:02:51.550
 Otherwise this becomes very tiring good 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:56.620
 It is also a bad host that I have here 

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:58.720
 butterfly the picacho no but we have not 

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:01.090
 defeated the young 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:03.040
 once expired we give to be of 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.650
 new that is already enabled we are going to 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.840
 pokemon and we use once between letters 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.790
 once again forgive the teleportation of 

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.820
 open and this sends us back to the center 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:14.740
 pocket and you will say and this so that very much 

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:16.120
 well this I do not know why it causes true 

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:17.830
 click on the game 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.600
 this works in the original cartridge 

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:21.250
 ok I have the original cartridge 

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.950
 saved this same point for 

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:26.050
 prove it if some unbeliever does not 

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:27.550
 is able to see this now in climbing the 

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:31.330
 pokemon bridge is going to press the start 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:32.800
 the only one here is then as soon as 

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:34.930
 let's go we will look like a pokémon 

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:38.170
 wild and this wild pokemon will not be 

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:41.459
 another one thousand we give to the bird 

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:41.459
 and there we have it 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:50.220
 with all of you new level 7 

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:52.080
 I do not know if I can fit the truth 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:53.460
 because it 's a bit very elusive but 

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:56.400
 to try 

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:58.980
 that we do not really have it asleep 

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:01.770
 I do not think I do not even think that a 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:02.910
 pokemon be able to hunt them 

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:05.110
 as much as level 7 is still 

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:07.210
 being mine 

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:08.450
 we should weaken it very much 

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:10.370
 much more 

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:13.099
 we can try come because we are here 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:16.639
 since we are here, I have the 

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:19.459
 quite high programs but good 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:21.049
 to get here quickly I 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:23.810
 started a game simply to 

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:26.629
 show you this and I 've done it to all 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:29.539
 speed is what I did with the turbo 

00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:32.180
 and then I trained everything like that 

00:04:29.539 --> 00:04:35.139
 way it's worth voucher music and asleep we're going to 

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:35.139
 give him a quick attack 

00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:40.980
 Oh 

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:42.930
 new loves to sleep apparently and 

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:44.430
 is there quietly and we are going to 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:45.990
 try it come min 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:49.530
 Stay not bother the video man 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:52.170
 let it finish nice we go very well mine 

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:53.670
 was caught so you see that the 

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:56.690
 pocket is correctly that does not have 

00:04:53.670 --> 00:04:56.690
 no type of error 

00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:03.240
 you enjoy my new species height 04 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:06.150
 meters weigh 4 kilograms when it is 

00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:08.910
 looked through a microscope can 

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:12.060
 look at the delicate hair of this 

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:15.930
 good pokemon in a bullshit 

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:17.669
 you want to give him a mold my friend is the 

00:05:15.930 --> 00:05:20.639
 only pokemon that can not have a boat 

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:22.139
 well here you have it that follows 

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:25.020
 asleep 

00:05:22.139 --> 00:05:27.060
 level 7 that comes with a design of 

00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:30.240
 attack of 20 defense mind speed and 

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:32.729
 19 special is not bad 

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:35.219
 it's not bad at all it only brings destroyer 

00:05:32.729 --> 00:05:38.879
 but you know well you can enter the 

00:05:35.219 --> 00:05:41.909
 wiki and easily discover what attacks 

00:05:38.879 --> 00:05:43.919
 learn from me besides being a beautiful 

00:05:41.909 --> 00:05:45.990
 prostitute for less because he learns them 

00:05:43.919 --> 00:05:48.090
 all if I'm not practically wrong 

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:50.159
 everyone here you see that the pokédex is 

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:52.940
 perfectly calcutta captured forgiveness 

00:05:50.159 --> 00:05:56.780
 at number 151 

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:59.360
 well nothing good guys finally the 

00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:01.490
 area that as you can see that area does not appear 

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:02.840
 unknown because this in theory in the 

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:04.460
 American cartridges gave it to you when 

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:06.050
 we hunted the 150 pokemon but the 

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:08.960
 European investment this is the only way 

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:11.780
 to hunt it legitimately it's worth it 

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:13.550
 legitimate in quotes but to hunt it 

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:15.950
 you now guys 

00:06:13.550 --> 00:06:18.680
 I hope you liked it and here 

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:20.690
 he stopped tormenting you with these 

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:22.850
 graphics of death that I hope you 

00:06:20.690 --> 00:06:24.500
 have liked this if you really do not 

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:26.090
 I say but this video share the name 

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:27.740
 because a lot of people who do not know 

00:06:26.090 --> 00:06:29.690
 this curiosity people that like me to 

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:32.510
 play these editions when they came out 

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:34.370
 towards the host of years and they were scratched 

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:36.950
 a lot to get a new that 

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:38.780
 it came cloned that it was level 100 that 

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:41.300
 it was from a coach who was called 

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:44.360
 script j I agree now rally and ximo and 

00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:46.880
 nobody knew this trick worth this is 

00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:51.610
 discovered time later at least in my 

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:51.610
 environment so nothing that they suspend
