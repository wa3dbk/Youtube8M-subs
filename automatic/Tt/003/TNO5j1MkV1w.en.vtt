on<00:01:19.619> guardian<00:01:20.310> dreadscythe<00:01:20.430> so<00:01:20.970> basically

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
on guardian dreadscythe so basically

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.330 
on guardian dreadscythe so basically
lucano<00:01:22.110> is<00:01:22.380> basically<00:01:22.799> just<00:01:22.830> getting<00:01:23.250> out

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
lucano is basically just getting out

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.620 
lucano is basically just getting out
guardian<00:01:23.700> dreadscythe<00:01:23.820> and<00:01:24.299> then<00:01:24.450> you<00:01:24.509> also

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:24.630 
guardian dreadscythe and then you also

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.780 
guardian dreadscythe and then you also
get<00:01:24.840> rid<00:01:25.020> of<00:01:25.049> one<00:01:25.799> face-up<00:01:26.009> or<00:01:26.280> maybe<00:01:26.520> you<00:01:26.640> want

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
get rid of one face-up or maybe you want

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290 
to get rid of fiendish chain that's

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.950 
to get rid of fiendish chain that's
targeting<00:01:28.920> something<00:01:29.100> else<00:01:29.369> I<00:01:29.520> don't<00:01:29.729> know

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
targeting something else I don't know

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.330

extensive play that you really don't

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:20.839 
extensive play that you really don't
need<00:02:19.140> I'll<00:02:19.380> explain<00:02:19.770> the<00:02:19.830> more<00:02:20.459> important

00:02:20.839 --> 00:02:20.849

need I'll explain the more important
stuff<00:02:21.000> later<00:02:22.459> but<00:02:23.459> if<00:02:23.580> he's<00:02:23.760> basically<00:02:24.120> just

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
stuff later but if he's basically just

stuff later but if he's basically just
getting<00:02:24.540> out<00:02:24.630> bring<00:02:24.930> monsters<00:02:25.290> right<00:02:25.410> now<00:02:25.530> so

00:02:25.699 --> 00:02:25.709 
getting out bring monsters right now so

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:27.199 
getting out bring monsters right now so
we<00:02:25.770> can<00:02:25.800> make<00:02:26.040> like<00:02:26.160> beyond<00:02:26.700> the<00:02:26.880> hope<00:02:27.030> and

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
we can make like beyond the hope and

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:29.150 
we can make like beyond the hope and
that<00:02:27.420> other<00:02:27.569> card<00:02:27.870> so<00:02:28.319> program<00:02:28.650> reaper<00:02:28.920> over

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
that other card so program reaper over

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:32.449 
that other card so program reaper over
here<00:02:29.400> has<00:02:29.849> the<00:02:30.510> effect<00:02:30.810> where<00:02:31.280> once<00:02:32.280> per<00:02:32.430> turn

00:02:32.449 --> 00:02:32.459 
here has the effect where once per turn

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:34.520 
here has the effect where once per turn
you<00:02:32.849> could<00:02:32.970> detach<00:02:33.300> 1<00:02:33.630> mature<00:02:33.989> from<00:02:34.170> this<00:02:34.290> card

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:34.530 
you could detach 1 mature from this card

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:36.320 
you could detach 1 mature from this card
then<00:02:35.069> each<00:02:35.280> player<00:02:35.550> sends<00:02:35.910> the<00:02:36.000> top<00:02:36.150> five

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
then each player sends the top five

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.509 
then each player sends the top five
cards<00:02:36.660> from<00:02:36.690> your<00:02:36.810> deck<00:02:36.900> to<00:02:37.019> the<00:02:37.140> graveyard<00:02:37.560> or

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519 
cards from your deck to the graveyard or

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:39.710 
cards from your deck to the graveyard or
their<00:02:38.670> entire<00:02:38.849> deck<00:02:39.060> approach<00:02:39.239> less<00:02:39.450> than<00:02:39.599> 5

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
their entire deck approach less than 5

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.089 
their entire deck approach less than 5
you<00:02:39.900> can<00:02:40.019> use<00:02:40.200> the<00:02:40.290> spectrum<00:02:40.620> North<00:02:40.769> per<00:02:40.920> turn

00:02:41.089 --> 00:02:41.099 
you can use the spectrum North per turn

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:42.920 
you can use the spectrum North per turn
but<00:02:41.370> it's<00:02:41.790> pretty<00:02:42.000> much<00:02:42.239> a<00:02:42.330> real<00:02:42.510> it's<00:02:42.660> just<00:02:42.840> to

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
but it's pretty much a real it's just to

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.750 
but it's pretty much a real it's just to
get<00:02:43.080> red<00:02:43.650> site<00:02:43.860> to<00:02:43.980> have<00:02:44.099> more<00:02:44.310> attack<00:02:44.400> it's

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
get red site to have more attack it's

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.479 
get red site to have more attack it's
completely<00:02:45.330> unnecessary<00:02:46.130> during<00:02:47.130> this<00:02:47.280> video

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
completely unnecessary during this video

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:49.400 
completely unnecessary during this video
but<00:02:47.850> I<00:02:48.030> mean<00:02:48.180> just<00:02:48.720> make<00:02:48.870> it<00:02:48.900> have<00:02:49.110> more<00:02:49.319> attack

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:18.750 
you can normal set but it doesn't matter

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.360

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.130 
just equipped up from the deck so like I

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:29.260 
just equipped up from the deck so like I
said<00:04:28.250> if<00:04:28.430> it<00:04:28.520> doesn't<00:04:28.700> really<00:04:28.790> matter<00:04:28.940> if<00:04:29.180> you

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:29.270 
said if it doesn't really matter if you

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:30.490 
said if it doesn't really matter if you
draw<00:04:29.420> it<00:04:29.540> or<00:04:29.630> not<00:04:29.780> but<00:04:29.930> that's<00:04:29.960> really<00:04:30.290> cool

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:30.500 
draw it or not but that's really cool

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:32.590 
draw it or not but that's really cool
that<00:04:30.920> he<00:04:31.070> actually<00:04:31.280> styled<00:04:31.790> on<00:04:32.060> his<00:04:32.180> opponent

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:32.600 
that he actually styled on his opponent

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:35.140 
that he actually styled on his opponent
by<00:04:32.690> going<00:04:33.080> for<00:04:33.410> me<00:04:34.010> beyond<00:04:34.370> the<00:04:34.520> hope<00:04:34.730> and<00:04:34.970> then

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:35.150 
by going for me beyond the hope and then

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:36.610 
by going for me beyond the hope and then
also<00:04:35.330> he's<00:04:35.630> got<00:04:35.780> this<00:04:35.930> monster<00:04:36.350> that<00:04:36.500> has

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:36.620 
also he's got this monster that has

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:38.560 
also he's got this monster that has
absurd<00:04:37.370> amounts<00:04:37.670> of<00:04:37.760> attack<00:04:38.000> that<00:04:38.030> obviously

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:38.570 
absurd amounts of attack that obviously

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:40.510 
absurd amounts of attack that obviously
you<00:04:38.780> can<00:04:39.200> still<00:04:39.470> attack<00:04:39.800> with<00:04:40.100> the<00:04:40.130> exit

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:40.520 
you can still attack with the exit

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:42.190 
you can still attack with the exit
beetle<00:04:40.790> so<00:04:41.000> basically<00:04:41.840> if<00:04:41.960> your<00:04:42.080> opponent

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:42.200 
beetle so basically if your opponent

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:43.990 
beetle so basically if your opponent
even<00:04:42.410> had<00:04:42.620> like<00:04:42.770> the<00:04:42.920> necros<00:04:43.280> of<00:04:43.400> Krishna<00:04:43.820> and

even had like the necros of Krishna and

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000 
even had like the necros of Krishna and

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:46.010 
maybe you need to get rid of a different

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:47.620 
maybe you need to get rid of a different
monster<00:04:46.190> that<00:04:46.550> they<00:04:46.670> happen<00:04:47.270> to<00:04:47.330> have<00:04:47.450> on
