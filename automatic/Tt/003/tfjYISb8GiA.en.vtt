00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:08.019
 hello good today I bring you the unboxing of 

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:10.839
 canon 100 of the ios 100 that ends 

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:16.650
 to go out a little bit on September 

00:00:10.839 --> 00:00:19.540
 of 2013 more or less has come out and nothing 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:22.240
 basically it is for you to see what there is 

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:24.730
 inside the camera and in another video os 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:27.670
 I will do a review and in another video I will do 

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:30.520
 a comparison with the 700 and also 

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:31.590
 with the 600 that I have here so 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:35.060
 nothing 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.060
 let's go up a bit this 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:48.180
 and nothing the first thing we see are 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:51.840
 the manual for the new objective 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:54.930
 that brings an objective s tm is more 

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:56.100
 silent and perfect to record what is 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:00.030
 the one I 'm using now with some 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:02.660
 700 a cd with a canon program for 

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.660
 edit photographs 

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.969
 brings us 

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.720
 the manuals in Spanish and in 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:22.800
 Portuguese 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.800
 among other 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:30.670
 and it seems to me that inside brings another cd 

00:01:28.299 --> 00:01:35.229
 good brings two cds because this must be 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:37.080
 like the 711 drivers jones de 

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:40.790
 software 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:43.160
 and nothing but we will continue 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:46.300
 here he tells us to make the most of 

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:46.300
 rays and others 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.470
 and already inside the box 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:03.040
 true 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:05.580
 we already have the belt the belt is a 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:09.180
 strap different from the 700 's 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.180
 have if the focus 

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.390
 let's go camarita 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:17.610
 about the seal 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.920
 it's different since that's not stitched that 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:21.920
 is 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:23.750
 the letters are a sticker is not 

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.120
 sewing for those who are 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.420
 used to have the 600 500 and 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:28.880
 the rest 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:31.140
 this is blank stitching and this is not 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.750
 all painted 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:36.560
 let's continue 

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:39.440
 here we have the battery charger 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:42.310
 it's a different battery than 600 a 

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:48.640
 500 and others is not that of 8 

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:48.640
 now I teach here we have the usb cable 

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.500
 around here we have the goal that what 

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:58.790
 we will see now 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.790
 and here we will have 

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:06.220
 the new battery that told you 

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:06.220
 I'm going to show you how it is 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:13.069
 because it's different is like 9 o'clock 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:15.459
 700 and the 600 but does not have up the 

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:15.459
 pin 

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:19.690
 it's squared 

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:29.760
 we have here the power cord 

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:32.849
 in the charger 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:36.769
 on that side there is no more and on this side 

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:36.769
 there is only the camera the box on one side 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.580
 and the camera we have here 

00:03:55.730 --> 00:04:00.400
 it's smaller 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:03.070
 at first sight at first sight is more 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.530
 little are not we right now 

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:07.660
 but good adapts and fits well 

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:09.280
 I will make a radio to you also and here 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:13.110
 we will have 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:13.110
 the new goal stm 

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:27.150
 what is exactly the same as that of 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:27.150
 600 of the 700 

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:34.999
 but good and you get the review of and 

00:04:33.050 --> 00:04:37.400
 nothing this is all it brings in the box 

00:04:34.999 --> 00:04:42.090

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:45.080
