 [Music] 

00:00:15.189 --> 00:00:20.300
 the architectural office based in 

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:23.090
 miami was responsible for the architecture 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:25.609
 of the mall jk iguatemi a project 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:27.800
 innovative minimalist revolutionary 

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:28.730
 brings a new look to the shopping center 

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:30.410
 in Brazil 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:33.320
 the space that enables diverse 

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:35.660
 inspirations experiences but how to take 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.940
 a coffee with friends technology for 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:40.519
 interact with the virtual world cinema 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:42.469
 theater and appreciation of works of great 

00:00:40.519 --> 00:00:45.260
 artists by their runners because 

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:46.640
 today this one directly from the delta 

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.340
 false from Brazil 

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.870
 She wants to try 15 years and director of 

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:53.270
 ttt tonic in brazil 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:55.489
 Schlesinger okay got there alright 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:57.469
 It's a pleasure to be here with you. 

00:00:55.489 --> 00:01:00.649
 It's a pleasure to also be able to share a 

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:03.050
 little of this wonderful project that this 

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:05.270
 experience that was the iguatemi jk that 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:06.619
 that pleasure and honor certainly is 

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:08.090
 all of you our 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:10.220
 sheila talk a little about the 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.899
 concept of the project which means a 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.390
 efficient square meter 

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:16.640
 the efficient square meter it is based 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.679
 in the layout of the plant 

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:22.789
 the plant for this project is a plant 

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:25.580
 square where it allows oxygenation to 

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:28.310
 from all stores to an audience that will 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:30.530
 be enjoying this mall he goes 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:34.459
 go through all the stores they will not 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:36.500
 have a corner a corner to a difficult 

00:01:34.459 --> 00:01:37.490
 access to some store where you 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.709
 devalue 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:42.440
 that's the efficient square meter 

00:01:39.709 --> 00:01:44.179
 mall also in addition it has 

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:47.000
 large corridors 

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:49.789
 the two main accesses they are a 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.970
 16 meter wide mold which is a 

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:55.940
 innovative concept where it is used in 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.989
 other countries here in Brazil is a 

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.420
 novelty 

00:01:56.989 --> 00:02:02.660
 eight meters are the two runners 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:06.709
 a project also he 

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:09.289
 incorporates terraces from which you can see 

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:13.040
 for an external landscape including 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:14.960
 part of the people and the inner mall of the 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:18.290
 development 

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:21.470
 already in Sheila what was the concept for 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:25.010
 facade of the agent used pure forms 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:27.320
 in addition to innovative materials is a 

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:30.170
 example that I'm going to quote is what's there 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:31.910
 you that he is a Japanese material he has been 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:35.210
 imported specifically for this 

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:38.030
 design and it is a crystallized glass 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:40.280
 where these crystal particles become 

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.210
 turn into a marble appearance 

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.700
 White 

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:47.120
 So look at a glass, it's not a stone. 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:50.900
 as everyone normally questions 

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:53.980
 another score the glasses of skylights 

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:56.090
 those are high efficiency glasses 

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:59.180
 just to tell us a little bit 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:03:01.850
 more and add on the windows of the 

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:04.730
 the windows to not have any 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:07.280
 reflection they will use the extra glass 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:08.360
 which will antireflex all very well 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.520
 thought not 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.470
 It's good the jk mall has applied several 

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:14.570
 sustainable concepts as we have already 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:17.030
 had said how the use of glass 

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:18.830
 which allow the entrance of natural light and 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:20.600
 the terraces that create a new concept 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:24.290
 bikes is that 

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:27.080
 This is part of sustainability beyond 

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:29.000
 of the sky light sa that they bring 

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:30.170
 natural light into the 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.750
 mall 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:35.080
 all lamps that were used 

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:37.970
 in the mall until the artificial lighting 

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:40.820
 they are led bulbs that have a 

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:43.610
 low energy consumption, we also 

00:03:40.820 --> 00:03:46.160
 You can quote the green cover to 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:50.300
 reuse of rainwater for 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:53.960
 irrigation we have garbage recycling 

00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:55.970
 underground as well as bicycle 

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:57.160
 for more than 200 bicycles 

00:03:55.970 --> 00:04:00.190
 very well 

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:02.410
 kaduna and practice is very practical to 

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:04.780
 sustainability is a consciousness in this 

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:07.060
 its sustainability and has become a 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:11.050
 market standard we do not have any more 

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:13.300
 how to get away from this pattern 

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:15.130
 only for the better for better 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:17.110
 sheila thank you very much for participating 

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:18.790
 here in our program 

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:21.220
 Congratulations on your project is very 

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:23.170
 Beautiful, thank you for coming here.

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:32.310
 Do not have this experience worth it 

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:32.310
