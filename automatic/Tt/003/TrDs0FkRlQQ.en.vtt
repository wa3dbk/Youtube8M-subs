00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:26.669
 next month 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.290
 why we put in the struggle for accession 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.290
 therefore we are going 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.310
 I have a little pain 

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:50.850
 the pcf 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.700
 their rise 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:53.920
 we already knew 

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.920
 European standards 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.700
 the ditty 

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:29.070
 twice as high 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:32.130
 this support has come 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.770
 they will take place in the group and the cdc 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.770
 we must raise our heads 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.530
 three Afghan escorts 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.050
 what are we waiting for 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:47.730
 that's why not 

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:48.950
 needs 

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:50.540
 resource-hungry 

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:53.540
 the damning report 

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:56.900
 it is done 

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.900
 you have to see or see again this season 

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.010
 it's a little that the psychic slogan that can not be heavy 

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:06.470
 a month earlier 

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:09.470
 elected term 

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:13.219
 if we believe that moment that the others 

00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:18.130
 almost four weeks 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.419
 even though 

00:02:20.419 --> 00:02:23.419
 when he leaves he smiles me 

00:02:25.949 --> 00:02:27.399
 made in germany 

00:02:27.399 --> 00:02:28.619
 bernard 

00:02:28.619 --> 00:02:31.619
 for other readers 

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:35.839
 an important player of the week 

00:02:36.869 --> 00:02:39.869
 tim duncan 

00:02:45.449 --> 00:02:48.239
 on his side, even menard 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:51.109
 however she remains 

00:02:51.109 --> 00:02:54.059
 from there 

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:55.310
 the natural living 

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.119
 Michel Dussuyer 

00:02:57.119 --> 00:03:00.119
 the Ivorian coach 

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:04.090
 the messages of support they need to speak 

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:08.759
 so that's true 

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:11.589
 study bloody 

00:03:11.589 --> 00:03:14.769
 bring her back 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:18.529
 the annual loss of yas marina hands of stone favoring the fight 

00:03:18.529 --> 00:03:21.529
 40th day of mourning after the death of the Loire 

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:26.499
 they were preparing to reconnect with the reserve to which they are convinced 

00:03:26.499 --> 00:03:27.729
 that michel mallard 

00:03:27.729 --> 00:03:30.729
 well to win the battle of last week 

00:03:31.809 --> 00:03:34.809
 She is not bad 

00:03:49.619 --> 00:03:52.919
 the ultimate number 10 

00:03:52.919 --> 00:03:55.919
 the slightest information 

00:03:56.969 --> 00:03:59.139
 because of theft 

00:03:59.139 --> 00:03:59.789
 adorned for the occasion
