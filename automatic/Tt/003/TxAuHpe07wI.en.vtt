what<00:00:21.720> you've<00:00:21.869> been<00:00:21.990> looking<00:00:22.350> at<00:00:22.470> is<00:00:22.590> phase<00:00:22.800> one

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
what you've been looking at is phase one

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.880 
what you've been looking at is phase one
of<00:00:23.100> the<00:00:23.220> project<00:00:23.369> where<00:00:24.359> I<00:00:24.390> use<00:00:24.750> the<00:00:25.109> plastic

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:25.890 
of the project where I use the plastic

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.390 
of the project where I use the plastic
socket<00:00:26.760> holders<00:00:27.269> as<00:00:27.539> my<00:00:27.980> anchoring<00:00:28.980> system

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
socket holders as my anchoring system

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.749 
socket holders as my anchoring system
for<00:00:30.179> the<00:00:30.269> rods<00:00:30.480> I<00:00:31.219> wanted<00:00:32.219> to<00:00:32.309> use<00:00:32.520> these

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
for the rods I wanted to use these

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.549 
for the rods I wanted to use these
because<00:00:33.600> you<00:00:33.750> could<00:00:33.870> slide<00:00:34.140> them<00:00:34.320> anymore

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
because you could slide them anymore

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.470 
because you could slide them anymore
along<00:00:34.860> the<00:00:35.010> rail<00:00:35.219> and<00:00:35.489> have<00:00:35.670> a<00:00:35.700> continuously

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
along the rail and have a continuously

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.319 
along the rail and have a continuously
adjustable<00:00:37.020> system<00:00:37.640> but<00:00:38.640> it<00:00:38.760> turned<00:00:39.000> out<00:00:39.149> they

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
adjustable system but it turned out they

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.750 
adjustable system but it turned out they
were<00:00:39.390> too<00:00:39.629> flimsy<00:00:39.930> and<00:00:40.440> simply<00:00:41.399> didn't<00:00:41.610> give<00:00:41.730> a

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
were too flimsy and simply didn't give a

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:44.540 
were too flimsy and simply didn't give a
stable<00:00:42.210> enough<00:00:42.329> platform<00:00:42.989> and<00:00:43.290> that<00:00:44.250> showed

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:44.550 
stable enough platform and that showed

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:48.080 
stable enough platform and that showed
up<00:00:44.789> in<00:00:44.940> the<00:00:45.059> quality<00:00:45.510> of<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:45.719> edge<00:00:46.489> so<00:00:47.489> this<00:00:47.910> is

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
up in the quality of the edge so this is

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.029 
up in the quality of the edge so this is
phase<00:00:48.329> two<00:00:48.570> the<00:00:48.600> system<00:00:49.170> with<00:00:49.500> an<00:00:49.649> improved

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
phase two the system with an improved

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:53.060 
phase two the system with an improved
anchoring<00:00:50.610> system<00:00:51.000> for<00:00:51.270> the<00:00:51.360> rods<00:00:52.070> with

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
anchoring system for the rods with

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.430 
anchoring system for the rods with
larger<00:00:53.550> knives<00:00:53.760> the<00:00:54.120> Lansky<00:00:54.690> clamp<00:00:54.989> isn't

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
larger knives the Lansky clamp isn't

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.290 
larger knives the Lansky clamp isn't
quite<00:00:55.680> strong<00:00:56.070> enough<00:00:56.100> so<00:00:56.640> I<00:00:56.670> use<00:00:56.910> a<00:00:57.059> wooden

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
quite strong enough so I use a wooden

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.130 
quite strong enough so I use a wooden
block<00:00:57.480> for<00:00:58.020> extra<00:00:58.469> support<00:00:59.570> this<00:01:00.570> is<00:01:00.780> a<00:01:00.809> list

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
block for extra support this is a list

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:04.359 
block for extra support this is a list
of<00:01:01.379> all<00:01:02.070> the<00:01:02.280> items<00:01:02.430> that<00:01:02.699> went<00:01:02.969> into<00:01:03.090> phase<00:01:03.329> 2

00:01:04.359 --> 00:01:04.369 
of all the items that went into phase 2

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:06.830 
of all the items that went into phase 2
you'll<00:01:05.369> see<00:01:05.460> there's<00:01:05.760> a<00:01:05.820> phase<00:01:06.090> 3<00:01:06.390> later<00:01:06.570> on

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
you'll see there's a phase 3 later on

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.840 
you'll see there's a phase 3 later on
that<00:01:07.020> adds<00:01:07.200> a<00:01:07.320> few<00:01:07.439> extra<00:01:07.799> items<00:01:08.189> but<00:01:08.490> they

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
that adds a few extra items but they

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.230 
that adds a few extra items but they
were<00:01:08.909> largely<00:01:09.950> no<00:01:10.950> cost<00:01:11.220> or<00:01:11.400> low<00:01:11.460> cost<00:01:11.790> or

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
were largely no cost or low cost or

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.109 
were largely no cost or low cost or
stuff<00:01:12.630> that<00:01:12.750> I<00:01:12.810> had<00:01:12.900> hanging<00:01:13.170> around<00:01:14.000> so<00:01:15.000> you

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119 
stuff that I had hanging around so you

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.499 
stuff that I had hanging around so you
can<00:01:15.360> see<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:15.869> total<00:01:16.409> cost<00:01:16.619> was<00:01:16.799> about<00:01:17.070> $85<00:01:17.939> but

00:01:18.499 --> 00:01:18.509 
can see the total cost was about $85 but

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:20.179 
can see the total cost was about $85 but
about<00:01:18.659> half<00:01:18.960> of<00:01:19.049> that<00:01:19.110> was<00:01:19.259> for<00:01:19.590> the<00:01:19.680> Lansky

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
about half of that was for the Lansky

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.899 
about half of that was for the Lansky

c-clamp<00:02:02.670> they<00:02:03.030> secure<00:02:03.979> pretty<00:02:04.979> darn<00:02:05.219> firmly

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640 
c-clamp they secure pretty darn firmly

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.670 
c-clamp they secure pretty darn firmly
and<00:02:06.119> give<00:02:06.329> a<00:02:06.360> nice<00:02:06.659> solid<00:02:07.049> base<00:02:07.079> which<00:02:07.530> was

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
and give a nice solid base which was

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.850 
and give a nice solid base which was
what<00:02:07.890> I<00:02:07.920> was<00:02:08.099> looking<00:02:08.429> for<00:02:09.289> to<00:02:10.289> mount<00:02:10.530> the

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
what I was looking for to mount the

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.550 
what I was looking for to mount the
u-joint<00:02:11.760> I<00:02:12.090> believe<00:02:12.989> a

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
u-joint I believe a

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:14.960 
u-joint I believe a
piece<00:02:13.650> of<00:02:13.680> quarter-inch<00:02:14.190> aluminium<00:02:14.730> bar

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
piece of quarter-inch aluminium bar

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:18.860 
piece of quarter-inch aluminium bar
inside<00:02:15.660> the<00:02:15.930> square<00:02:16.349> tube<00:02:17.090> then<00:02:18.090> I<00:02:18.120> drilled<00:02:18.720> a

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
inside the square tube then I drilled a

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.330 
inside the square tube then I drilled a
hole<00:02:18.900> and<00:02:19.730> glued<00:02:20.730> the<00:02:20.880> u-joint<00:02:21.360> into<00:02:21.720> place

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:22.340 
hole and glued the u-joint into place

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.580 
hole and glued the u-joint into place
even<00:02:23.340> though<00:02:23.670> I'm<00:02:23.760> a<00:02:23.849> fan<00:02:24.060> of<00:02:24.090> epoxy<00:02:24.780> I<00:02:25.050> decided

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
even though I'm a fan of epoxy I decided

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:27.470 
even though I'm a fan of epoxy I decided
to<00:02:25.890> strap<00:02:26.280> the<00:02:26.489> brass<00:02:26.730> tubes<00:02:27.150> to<00:02:27.450> the

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480 
to strap the brass tubes to the

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.190 
to strap the brass tubes to the
sharpening<00:02:28.080> stones<00:02:28.440> using<00:02:29.069> zip<00:02:29.459> ties<00:02:29.670> as<00:02:30.200> you

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
sharpening stones using zip ties as you

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.410 
sharpening stones using zip ties as you
can<00:02:31.380> see<00:02:31.650> the<00:02:31.920> rod<00:02:32.160> slips<00:02:32.640> into<00:02:32.849> the<00:02:32.940> brass

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
can see the rod slips into the brass

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.330 
can see the rod slips into the brass
tubes<00:02:33.720> fairly<00:02:34.230> tightly<00:02:34.470> there's<00:02:34.950> a<00:02:35.010> little

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
tubes fairly tightly there's a little

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:38.600 
tubes fairly tightly there's a little
bit<00:02:35.430> of<00:02:35.519> play<00:02:35.760> but<00:02:36.660> not<00:02:36.780> a<00:02:36.810> whole<00:02:37.019> lot<00:02:37.200> I<00:02:37.610> cut

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:38.610 
bit of play but not a whole lot I cut

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:40.100 
bit of play but not a whole lot I cut
the<00:02:38.730> brass<00:02:38.940> tube<00:02:39.180> short<00:02:39.510> enough<00:02:39.750> so<00:02:39.959> that<00:02:39.989> I

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:40.110 
the brass tube short enough so that I

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.020 
the brass tube short enough so that I
could<00:02:40.349> still<00:02:40.560> use<00:02:40.620> the<00:02:40.980> original<00:02:41.190> Lansky<00:02:41.790> rods

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030 
could still use the original Lansky rods

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.330 
could still use the original Lansky rods
just<00:02:42.780> in<00:02:42.900> case<00:02:43.080> I<00:02:43.260> wanted<00:02:43.530> to<00:02:43.650> go<00:02:43.769> back<00:02:43.950> and<00:02:44.190> use

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:44.340 
just in case I wanted to go back and use

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:46.550 
just in case I wanted to go back and use
the<00:02:44.519> Lansky<00:02:44.910> system<00:02:45.330> the<00:02:46.170> way<00:02:46.319> it<00:02:46.440> was

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
the Lansky system the way it was

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.479 
the Lansky system the way it was
originally<00:02:47.010> designed<00:02:47.810> and<00:02:49.100> here<00:02:50.100> you<00:02:50.220> can<00:02:50.370> see

00:02:50.479 --> 00:02:50.489 
originally designed and here you can see

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:52.449 
originally designed and here you can see
the<00:02:50.640> system<00:02:51.000> in<00:02:51.120> action

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:52.459 
the system in action

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:54.800 
the system in action
now<00:02:53.459> it's<00:02:53.670> probably<00:02:54.000> a<00:02:54.030> good<00:02:54.120> time<00:02:54.180> to<00:02:54.420> point

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
now it's probably a good time to point

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:56.720 
now it's probably a good time to point
out<00:02:54.959> that<00:02:55.200> when<00:02:55.620> you<00:02:55.650> buy<00:02:55.920> your<00:02:56.160> quarter<00:02:56.549> inch

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
out that when you buy your quarter inch

00:02:56.730 --> 00:03:00.170 
out that when you buy your quarter inch
rods<00:02:58.130> get<00:02:59.130> the<00:02:59.250> ones<00:02:59.459> that<00:02:59.670> don't<00:02:59.790> have<00:02:59.940> the

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
rods get the ones that don't have the

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.910 
rods get the ones that don't have the
knurls<00:03:00.599> enter<00:03:00.870> the<00:03:00.989> base<00:03:01.170> you<00:03:01.440> can<00:03:01.590> see<00:03:01.620> those

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:01.920 
knurls enter the base you can see those

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.920 
knurls enter the base you can see those
at<00:03:02.069> the<00:03:02.160> bottom<00:03:02.310> there<00:03:02.730> they<00:03:03.599> make<00:03:03.750> a<00:03:03.810> little

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:03.930 
at the bottom there they make a little

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.240 
at the bottom there they make a little
bit<00:03:04.110> of<00:03:04.140> noise<00:03:04.380> it's<00:03:04.650> a<00:03:04.739> little<00:03:04.950> bit<00:03:05.040> annoying

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
bit of noise it's a little bit annoying

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.059 
bit of noise it's a little bit annoying
not<00:03:06.209> a<00:03:06.239> big<00:03:06.540> deal<00:03:06.750> but<00:03:07.080> if<00:03:07.620> you<00:03:07.769> can<00:03:07.860> get<00:03:07.980> them

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:08.069 
not a big deal but if you can get them

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:09.289 
not a big deal but if you can get them
they're<00:03:08.190> smooth<00:03:08.549> all<00:03:08.730> the<00:03:08.819> way<00:03:08.910> down<00:03:09.090> you'll

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:09.299 
they're smooth all the way down you'll

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:12.500 
they're smooth all the way down you'll
probably<00:03:09.510> be<00:03:09.780> happier<00:03:11.239> what's<00:03:12.239> nice<00:03:12.480> about

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
probably be happier what's nice about

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.809 
probably be happier what's nice about
this<00:03:12.989> clamping<00:03:13.500> system<00:03:13.709> is<00:03:14.190> that<00:03:14.400> I<00:03:14.459> can<00:03:14.670> go

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:14.819 
this clamping system is that I can go

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:18.140 
this clamping system is that I can go
from<00:03:15.000> zero<00:03:15.599> degrees<00:03:15.630> perfectly<00:03:16.560> vertical<00:03:17.150> all

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
from zero degrees perfectly vertical all

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.599 
from zero degrees perfectly vertical all
the<00:03:18.329> way<00:03:18.420> to<00:03:18.480> about<00:03:18.720> 45<00:03:19.350> degrees<00:03:19.859> and<00:03:20.160> have

00:03:20.599 --> 00:03:20.609 
the way to about 45 degrees and have

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:23.440 
the way to about 45 degrees and have
continuous<00:03:21.420> adjustment<00:03:21.570> along<00:03:22.530> the<00:03:22.709> way<00:03:22.859> I

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
continuous adjustment along the way I

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:25.729 
continuous adjustment along the way I
was<00:03:24.450> thinking<00:03:24.840> about<00:03:24.959> what<00:03:25.320> I<00:03:25.350> was<00:03:25.500> going<00:03:25.650> to

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739 
was thinking about what I was going to

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:28.130 
was thinking about what I was going to
use<00:03:25.890> for<00:03:26.250> determining<00:03:27.030> angles<00:03:27.780> and<00:03:28.019> was

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
use for determining angles and was

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:30.229 
use for determining angles and was
thinking<00:03:28.650> about<00:03:28.739> protractors<00:03:29.459> and<00:03:29.489> so<00:03:29.850> on<00:03:30.030> and

00:03:30.229 --> 00:03:30.239 
thinking about protractors and so on and

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:32.930 
thinking about protractors and so on and
I<00:03:30.890> realized<00:03:31.890> I<00:03:32.040> have<00:03:32.220> this<00:03:32.400> little<00:03:32.700> app<00:03:32.910> that

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
I realized I have this little app that

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.780 
I realized I have this little app that
lets<00:03:33.359> me<00:03:33.630> set<00:03:34.019> angles<00:03:34.470> or<00:03:34.709> measure<00:03:34.950> angles<00:03:35.459> on

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:35.790 
lets me set angles or measure angles on

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.870 
lets me set angles or measure angles on
my<00:03:36.359> android<00:03:36.750> phone<00:03:36.950> so<00:03:37.950> this<00:03:38.160> is<00:03:38.310> called<00:03:38.519> smart

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:38.880 
my android phone so this is called smart

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:40.160 
my android phone so this is called smart
sensors<00:03:39.299> and<00:03:39.510> this<00:03:39.600> is<00:03:39.720> the<00:03:39.840> orientation

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.170 
sensors and this is the orientation

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:43.670 
sensors and this is the orientation
sensor<00:03:40.829> I<00:03:41.840> think<00:03:42.840> that's<00:03:43.019> going<00:03:43.200> to<00:03:43.260> give<00:03:43.530> you

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
sensor I think that's going to give you

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.009 
sensor I think that's going to give you
as<00:03:43.920> accurate<00:03:44.700> angle<00:03:45.000> as<00:03:45.090> you<00:03:45.120> really<00:03:45.480> need<00:03:45.720> for

00:03:46.009 --> 00:03:46.019 
as accurate angle as you really need for

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:49.250 
as accurate angle as you really need for
sharpening<00:03:46.530> a<00:03:46.709> knife<00:03:47.690> after<00:03:48.690> all<00:03:48.840> if<00:03:49.079> you're

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:49.260 
sharpening a knife after all if you're

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.410 
sharpening a knife after all if you're
trying<00:03:49.590> to<00:03:49.739> match<00:03:49.950> the<00:03:50.250> edge<00:03:50.489> of<00:03:50.819> a<00:03:50.910> knife<00:03:51.090> that

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:51.420 
trying to match the edge of a knife that

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:52.789 
trying to match the edge of a knife that
you<00:03:51.510> already<00:03:51.630> have<00:03:51.959> you're<00:03:52.350> probably<00:03:52.590> going

00:03:52.789 --> 00:03:52.799 
you already have you're probably going

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:57.099 
you already have you're probably going
to<00:03:52.889> use<00:03:52.980> something<00:03:53.190> like<00:03:53.489> the<00:03:54.350> Sharpie<00:03:55.350> trick

00:03:57.099 --> 00:03:57.109 
to use something like the Sharpie trick

00:03:57.109 --> 00:04:00.289 
to use something like the Sharpie trick
so<00:03:58.109> what<00:03:58.440> you<00:03:58.530> see<00:03:58.739> here<00:03:59.130> is<00:03:59.340> phase<00:03:59.970> two

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:00.299 
so what you see here is phase two

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:01.250 
so what you see here is phase two
complete

but<00:04:02.250> I<00:04:02.280> wasn't<00:04:02.670> quite<00:04:02.819> happy<00:04:03.359> with<00:04:03.510> phase<00:04:04.230> two

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:04.470 
but I wasn't quite happy with phase two

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:05.809 
but I wasn't quite happy with phase two

about<00:04:49.940> a<00:04:50.060> dollar<00:04:50.389> fifty<00:04:50.780> I<00:04:50.990> think<00:04:51.319> from<00:04:51.530> the

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:51.650 
about a dollar fifty I think from the

about a dollar fifty I think from the
art<00:04:51.830> supply<00:04:52.190> store<00:04:52.550> I<00:04:53.379> added<00:04:54.379> them<00:04:54.530> just<00:04:54.860> a

00:04:55.059 --> 00:04:55.069 
art supply store I added them just a

00:04:55.069 --> 00:04:57.999 
art supply store I added them just a
fried<00:04:55.789> reference<00:04:56.300> points<00:04:56.780> so<00:04:57.409> that<00:04:57.440> you<00:04:57.590> could

00:04:57.999 --> 00:04:58.009 
fried reference points so that you could

00:04:58.009 --> 00:05:01.300 
fried reference points so that you could
put<00:04:58.370> the<00:04:58.490> clamps<00:04:58.789> back<00:04:59.030> in<00:04:59.300> a<00:05:00.009> position<00:05:01.009> that

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:01.310 
put the clamps back in a position that

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:03.700 
put the clamps back in a position that
you<00:05:01.550> had<00:05:01.759> used<00:05:02.120> previously<00:05:02.500> for<00:05:03.500> some
