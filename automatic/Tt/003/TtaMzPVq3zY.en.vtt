that kind of stuff and basically what

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.530 
that kind of stuff and basically what
oxidization<00:00:10.769> is<00:00:10.920> is<00:00:11.130> a<00:00:11.160> term<00:00:11.580> that<00:00:11.610> happens<00:00:12.360> to

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899 
happened on that is because of

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:51.229 
happened on that is because of
oxidization<00:00:49.649> and<00:00:49.860> many<00:00:50.219> foundations<00:00:50.579> do<00:00:51.030> that

00:00:51.229 --> 00:00:51.239 
oxidization and many foundations do that

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:53.209 
oxidization and many foundations do that
when<00:00:52.110> it<00:00:52.199> comes<00:00:52.410> to<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:52.649> breakdown<00:00:53.070> of

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
when it comes to the breakdown of

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.340 
when it comes to the breakdown of
foundations<00:00:53.760> many<00:00:54.059> of<00:00:54.210> them<00:00:54.390> are<00:00:54.600> pigment<00:00:55.140> and

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
foundations many of them are pigment and

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.260 
foundations many of them are pigment and
they're<00:00:55.770> either<00:00:55.890> oil<00:00:56.039> or<00:00:56.460> water-based<00:00:56.850> some

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
they're either oil or water-based some

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.970 
they're either oil or water-based some
of<00:00:57.390> them<00:00:57.510> are<00:00:57.660> silicone<00:00:58.140> base<00:00:58.410> there's

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
of them are silicone base there's

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.500 
of them are silicone base there's
definitely<00:00:59.460> a<00:00:59.640> lot<00:00:59.879> of<00:00:59.940> different<00:01:00.359> things

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
definitely a lot of different things

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.630 
definitely a lot of different things
inside<00:01:00.960> of<00:01:01.079> there<00:01:01.230> but<00:01:01.739> what<00:01:01.890> happens<00:01:02.340> kind<00:01:02.579> of

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
inside of there but what happens kind of

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.369 
inside of there but what happens kind of
across<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:02.969> board<00:01:03.239> is<00:01:03.690> that<00:01:03.840> sometimes

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
across the board is that sometimes

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.950 
across the board is that sometimes
especially<00:01:05.129> if<00:01:05.250> people<00:01:05.280> have<00:01:05.700> wavy<00:01:06.090> skin<00:01:06.450> when

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
especially if people have wavy skin when

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.730 
especially if people have wavy skin when
you<00:01:07.049> put<00:01:07.430> hush<00:01:08.430> hush<00:01:09.090> hush<00:01:09.350> when<00:01:10.350> you<00:01:10.500> put

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:10.740 
you put hush hush hush when you put

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.070 
you put hush hush hush when you put
foundation<00:01:10.979> on<00:01:11.400> your<00:01:11.580> skin<00:01:11.909> it<00:01:12.210> can<00:01:12.540> actually

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
foundation on your skin it can actually

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.440 
foundation on your skin it can actually
react<00:01:13.470> with<00:01:13.770> both<00:01:14.070> the<00:01:14.220> air<00:01:14.430> and<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:15.000> oils<00:01:15.330> on

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
react with both the air and the oils on

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.289 
react with both the air and the oils on
your<00:01:15.600> face<00:01:15.840> and<00:01:16.110> change<00:01:16.530> color<00:01:16.860> and

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
especially for people with oil like me

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:21.859 
especially for people with oil like me
for<00:01:20.159> some<00:01:20.400> reason<00:01:20.820> the<00:01:20.939> oil<00:01:21.180> in<00:01:21.450> my<00:01:21.570> face

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
for some reason the oil in my face

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:23.810 
for some reason the oil in my face
really<00:01:22.259> reacts<00:01:22.740> with<00:01:22.860> a<00:01:22.920> lot<00:01:23.159> of<00:01:23.310> foundations

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
really reacts with a lot of foundations

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.640 
really reacts with a lot of foundations
and<00:01:23.970> actually<00:01:24.330> causes<00:01:24.840> it<00:01:24.960> talks<00:01:25.200> and<00:01:25.560> eyes

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
and actually causes it talks and eyes

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.770 
and actually causes it talks and eyes
and<00:01:26.040> oxidized<00:01:26.820> is<00:01:27.090> basically<00:01:27.479> the<00:01:27.600> term

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780 
and oxidized is basically the term

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.499 
and oxidized is basically the term
getting<00:01:28.110> oxygen<00:01:28.710> to<00:01:28.950> something<00:01:29.400> um<00:01:29.640> you<00:01:30.390> know

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
getting oxygen to something um you know

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.050 
getting oxygen to something um you know
the<00:01:31.020> heart<00:01:31.409> and<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:31.799> lungs<00:01:32.009> oxidize<00:01:32.790> the

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
the heart and the lungs oxidize the

blood um by giving oxygen to the blood
kind<00:01:37.290> of<00:01:37.530> like<00:01:37.710> what<00:01:37.890> happens<00:01:38.250> to<00:01:38.460> your

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
kind of like what happens to your

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.160 
kind of like what happens to your
foundation<00:01:39.060> on<00:01:39.180> your<00:01:39.299> face<00:01:39.509> only<00:01:39.750> it<00:01:39.900> doesn't

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
foundation on your face only it doesn't

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.910 
foundation on your face only it doesn't
have<00:01:40.320> organs<00:01:40.799> and<00:01:41.310> a<00:01:41.640> respiratory<00:01:42.570> system<00:01:43.320> but

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
have organs and a respiratory system but

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.130 
have organs and a respiratory system but
um<00:01:44.159> when<00:01:45.030> you<00:01:45.119> put<00:01:45.270> foundation<00:01:45.450> on<00:01:45.810> your<00:01:45.960> face

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
um when you put foundation on your face

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.050 
um when you put foundation on your face
a<00:01:46.170> lot<00:01:46.470> of<00:01:46.530> times<00:01:46.829> the<00:01:47.040> air<00:01:47.189> can<00:01:47.430> react<00:01:47.700> to<00:01:47.939> it

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
a lot of times the air can react to it

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.520 
a lot of times the air can react to it
and<00:01:48.180> you<00:01:48.600> can<00:01:48.750> actually<00:01:48.899> test<00:01:49.350> out<00:01:49.470> your

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:49.530 
and you can actually test out your

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:51.260 
and you can actually test out your
foundation<00:01:50.070> and<00:01:50.159> see<00:01:50.310> if<00:01:50.430> its<00:01:50.549> oxidizing<00:01:51.030> by

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
foundation and see if its oxidizing by

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.580 
foundation and see if its oxidizing by
putting<00:01:51.570> a<00:01:51.630> little<00:01:51.689> bit<00:01:51.899> on<00:01:51.990> your<00:01:52.079> hand<00:01:52.140> and

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
putting a little bit on your hand and

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.740 
putting a little bit on your hand and
letting<00:01:52.740> it<00:01:52.920> dry<00:01:52.979> and<00:01:53.579> if<00:01:54.060> you<00:01:54.180> notice<00:01:54.509> that<00:01:54.630> it

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
letting it dry and if you notice that it

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.569 
letting it dry and if you notice that it
really<00:01:54.960> darkens<00:01:55.530> when<00:01:55.710> it<00:01:55.799> dries<00:01:56.070> that

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
really darkens when it dries that

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:57.950 
really darkens when it dries that
probably<00:01:57.119> means<00:01:57.329> that<00:01:57.390> it's<00:01:57.570> prone<00:01:57.840> to

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
probably means that it's prone to

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:00.380 
probably means that it's prone to
oxidizing<00:01:58.590> in<00:01:58.710> general<00:01:59.130> now<00:01:59.670> if<00:01:59.880> it<00:02:00.030> doesn't

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
oxidizing in general now if it doesn't

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:01.910 
oxidizing in general now if it doesn't
do<00:02:00.479> that<00:02:00.600> immediately<00:02:00.840> it<00:02:01.320> could<00:02:01.590> be<00:02:01.710> that<00:02:01.829> you

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
do that immediately it could be that you

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.530 
do that immediately it could be that you
have<00:02:01.950> a<00:02:02.159> lot<00:02:02.399> of<00:02:02.430> oil<00:02:02.640> on<00:02:02.850> your<00:02:02.969> face<00:02:03.180> that<00:02:03.420> is

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:03.540 
have a lot of oil on your face that is

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.810 
have a lot of oil on your face that is
causing<00:02:03.869> that<00:02:03.899> as<00:02:04.110> well<00:02:04.350> but<00:02:05.130> normally<00:02:05.640> any

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:05.820 
causing that as well but normally any

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.280 
causing that as well but normally any
foundation<00:02:06.329> that<00:02:06.420> you<00:02:06.479> put<00:02:06.719> on<00:02:06.840> if<00:02:07.020> you<00:02:07.110> leave

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
foundation that you put on if you leave

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:08.690 
foundation that you put on if you leave
it<00:02:07.409> on<00:02:07.469> for<00:02:07.530> a<00:02:07.740> little<00:02:07.920> bit<00:02:08.009> it<00:02:08.160> normally<00:02:08.520> will

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
it on for a little bit it normally will

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.969 
it on for a little bit it normally will
darken<00:02:09.060> just<00:02:09.300> a<00:02:09.390> smidgen<00:02:09.840> so<00:02:10.020> always<00:02:10.739> keep

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
darken just a smidgen so always keep

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.309 
darken just a smidgen so always keep
that<00:02:11.129> in<00:02:11.190> mind<00:02:11.580> so<00:02:12.090> how<00:02:12.480> do<00:02:12.540> you<00:02:12.780> know<00:02:12.989> if<00:02:13.170> they

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
that in mind so how do you know if they

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:13.760 
that in mind so how do you know if they
found<00:02:13.560> it

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
found it

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.590 
found it
is<00:02:13.830> going<00:02:14.040> to<00:02:14.130> oxidize<00:02:14.490> you<00:02:14.880> really<00:02:15.150> don't<00:02:15.420> the

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
is going to oxidize you really don't the

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.430 
is going to oxidize you really don't the
best<00:02:15.810> ways<00:02:16.020> to<00:02:16.050> test<00:02:16.470> it<00:02:16.680> out<00:02:16.770> wait<00:02:17.490> 5<00:02:18.240> 10<00:02:18.750> 15

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
best ways to test it out wait 5 10 15

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.170 
best ways to test it out wait 5 10 15
minutes<00:02:19.890> and<00:02:20.100> then<00:02:20.490> go<00:02:20.640> back<00:02:20.790> and<00:02:21.000> look<00:02:21.060> at

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:21.180 
minutes and then go back and look at

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.610 
minutes and then go back and look at
your<00:02:21.210> skin<00:02:21.330> and<00:02:21.810> see<00:02:21.930> which<00:02:22.080> one<00:02:22.260> is<00:02:22.290> the<00:02:22.470> best

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:22.620 
your skin and see which one is the best

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.260 
your skin and see which one is the best
match<00:02:22.920> because<00:02:23.250> that's<00:02:23.430> how<00:02:23.610> its<00:02:23.820> overall

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:24.270 
match because that's how its overall

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.990 
match because that's how its overall
going<00:02:24.480> to<00:02:24.630> dry<00:02:25.460> now<00:02:26.460> what<00:02:26.640> if<00:02:26.730> you<00:02:26.820> already

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
going to dry now what if you already

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.490 
going to dry now what if you already
have<00:02:27.270> like<00:02:27.450> a<00:02:27.540> favorite<00:02:27.840> foundation<00:02:28.350> that<00:02:28.470> you

don't want to waste forty dollars what
do<00:02:41.610> I<00:02:41.700> do<00:02:41.760> you<00:02:42.510> can't<00:02:42.840> apply<00:02:43.050> different

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
do I do you can't apply different

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.920 
do I do you can't apply different
primers<00:02:43.740> especially<00:02:44.730> a<00:02:44.790> silicone<00:02:45.300> primer<00:02:45.630> it

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:45.930 
primers especially a silicone primer it

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:47.900 
primers especially a silicone primer it
keeps<00:02:46.440> the<00:02:46.560> foundation<00:02:47.070> on<00:02:47.220> the<00:02:47.400> skin<00:02:47.730> but

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:47.910 
keeps the foundation on the skin but

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:49.610 
keeps the foundation on the skin but
doesn't<00:02:48.330> let<00:02:48.510> as<00:02:48.660> much<00:02:48.810> as<00:02:48.930> the<00:02:49.020> oil<00:02:49.230> shine

through that being said there's still

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.140 
through that being said there's still
oxygen<00:02:52.830> that<00:02:52.980> is<00:02:53.100> drawing<00:02:53.430> out<00:02:53.640> the<00:02:53.670> fat<00:02:53.940> like

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.150 
oxygen that is drawing out the fat like

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:55.820 
oxygen that is drawing out the fat like
you<00:02:54.330> know<00:02:54.480> that<00:02:54.930> dries<00:02:55.170> the<00:02:55.320> foundation<00:02:55.710> when

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:55.830 
you know that dries the foundation when

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:57.830 
you know that dries the foundation when
it's<00:02:55.950> on<00:02:56.040> your<00:02:56.190> skin<00:02:56.490> that<00:02:56.670> in<00:02:57.150> general<00:02:57.390> will

it's on your skin that in general will

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.360 
it's on your skin that in general will
cause<00:02:58.050> a<00:02:58.080> little<00:02:58.320> bit<00:02:58.470> of<00:02:58.530> oxidization<00:02:59.280> that

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
cause a little bit of oxidization that

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:00.890 
cause a little bit of oxidization that
you<00:02:59.460> can't<00:02:59.670> do<00:02:59.760> anything<00:02:59.910> about<00:03:00.090> but<00:03:00.690> if<00:03:00.780> you

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:00.900 
you can't do anything about but if you

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.870 
you can't do anything about but if you
apply<00:03:01.200> a<00:03:01.230> primer<00:03:01.620> that<00:03:01.830> could<00:03:02.310> help<00:03:02.490> if<00:03:02.730> the

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:02.880

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
oil is part of the oxidization problem

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.240 
oil is part of the oxidization problem
so<00:03:05.580> um<00:03:06.050> that's<00:03:07.050> a<00:03:07.230> little<00:03:07.440> bit<00:03:07.590> about<00:03:07.800> it<00:03:08.010> let

00:03:15.530 --> 00:03:15.540 
bottom comments but basically it's the

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:17.870 
bottom comments but basically it's the
act<00:03:15.720> of<00:03:16.050> the<00:03:16.380> foundation<00:03:16.890> dries<00:03:17.340> a<00:03:17.370> little<00:03:17.580> bit

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:17.880 
act of the foundation dries a little bit

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.370 
act of the foundation dries a little bit
of<00:03:18.120> course<00:03:18.360> it<00:03:18.540> dries<00:03:18.750> when<00:03:18.930> you<00:03:19.020> take<00:03:19.200> it<00:03:19.320> out

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:19.380 
of course it dries when you take it out

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:21.230 
of course it dries when you take it out
of<00:03:19.440> a<00:03:19.560> tube<00:03:19.800> and<00:03:20.070> it<00:03:20.459> dries<00:03:20.670> a<00:03:20.700> different<00:03:21.060> color

00:03:21.230 --> 00:03:21.240 
of a tube and it dries a different color

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:23.000 
of a tube and it dries a different color
on<00:03:21.390> your<00:03:21.540> skin<00:03:21.600> because<00:03:22.110> of<00:03:22.140> the<00:03:22.290> oxygen<00:03:22.860> it

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:23.010 
on your skin because of the oxygen it

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:25.280 
on your skin because of the oxygen it
mixes<00:03:23.340> with<00:03:23.520> it<00:03:23.700> so<00:03:23.970> definitely<00:03:24.840> test<00:03:25.110> out

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:25.290 
mixes with it so definitely test out

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.110 
mixes with it so definitely test out
your<00:03:25.320> foundation<00:03:25.830> in<00:03:25.890> the<00:03:25.950> right<00:03:26.100> way<00:03:26.310> be<00:03:26.790> very

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:29.610 
the other things that this normally

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:31.760 
the other things that this normally
happens<00:03:29.940> with<00:03:30.060> liquid<00:03:30.390> foundation<00:03:30.930> usually

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:31.770 
happens with liquid foundation usually

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:34.180 
happens with liquid foundation usually

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:34.190 
not so much with a powder foundation

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:36.800 
not so much with a powder foundation
just<00:03:35.190> because<00:03:35.640> it's<00:03:35.940> the<00:03:36.030> liquid<00:03:36.240> foundation

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
just because it's the liquid foundation

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.120 
just because it's the liquid foundation
that<00:03:36.959> is<00:03:37.080> really<00:03:37.440> going<00:03:37.620> through<00:03:37.800> more<00:03:37.980> of<00:03:38.070> a

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130

that is really going through more of a
change<00:03:38.520> from<00:03:38.880> you<00:03:39.300> know<00:03:39.450> complete<00:03:39.810> liquid<00:03:40.080> to

change from you know complete liquid to

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.260 
change from you know complete liquid to
kind<00:03:40.350> of<00:03:40.440> dry<00:03:40.680> ish<00:03:41.040> on<00:03:41.370> your<00:03:41.610> face<00:03:41.850> whereas<00:03:42.209> a

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950 
those oxidize much more reason why is

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:55.460
