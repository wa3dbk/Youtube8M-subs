the items are going to be a little bit
pricier<00:05:10.240> and<00:05:10.539> so<00:05:10.690> you're<00:05:10.870> going<00:05:11.020> to<00:05:11.080> want<00:05:11.259> to

pricier and so you're going to want to

00:05:11.349 --> 00:05:13.710 
pricier and so you're going to want to
just<00:05:11.620> look<00:05:11.770> at<00:05:11.919> the<00:05:12.039> menu<00:05:12.430> and<00:05:12.759> then<00:05:12.970> work<00:05:13.509> that
