00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
carrots okay and that's a low dose if

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:41.840 
carrots okay and that's a low dose if
you<00:01:40.770> eat<00:01:40.920> something<00:01:41.189> like<00:01:41.280> Joe<00:01:41.610> Weider

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
don't need a research study to observe a

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.510 
don't need a research study to observe a
dog<00:03:48.900> in<00:03:49.140> the<00:03:49.260> wild<00:03:49.650> that<00:03:49.770> hunts<00:03:50.160> it<00:03:50.250> eats

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:50.520 
dog in the wild that hunts it eats

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:53.750 
dog in the wild that hunts it eats
animals<00:03:50.850> right<00:03:51.660> so<00:03:52.470> we<00:03:52.680> our<00:03:53.220> level<00:03:53.640> of

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
animals right so we our level of

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.150 
animals right so we our level of
intelligence<00:03:54.090> has<00:03:54.480> dropped<00:03:54.720> so<00:03:55.050> low<00:03:55.080> that<00:03:55.709> we

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
intelligence has dropped so low that we

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.940 
intelligence has dropped so low that we
want<00:03:56.459> to<00:03:56.520> feed<00:03:56.790> dogs<00:03:57.180> the<00:03:58.080> way<00:03:58.230> we<00:03:58.410> feed<00:03:58.620> sick

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:58.950 
want to feed dogs the way we feed sick

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:00.470 
want to feed dogs the way we feed sick
human<00:03:59.280> beings<00:03:59.580> so<00:03:59.730> what<00:03:59.850> do<00:03:59.940> you<00:04:00.000> do<00:04:00.120> have<00:04:00.330> you

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.480 
human beings so what do you do have you

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.510 
human beings so what do you do have you
have<00:04:00.600> a<00:04:00.660> fat<00:04:00.989> sitting<00:04:01.500> dog<00:04:01.680> that<00:04:01.950> farts<00:04:02.340> all

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:02.520 
have a fat sitting dog that farts all

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:06.130 
have a fat sitting dog that farts all
the<00:04:02.640> time<00:04:02.850> and<00:04:03.680> does<00:04:04.680> that<00:04:04.860> sound<00:04:05.100> familiar

00:04:06.130 --> 00:04:06.140 
the time and does that sound familiar

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:09.050 
the time and does that sound familiar
actually<00:04:07.140> does<00:04:07.290> and<00:04:08.100> do<00:04:08.250> we<00:04:08.370> need<00:04:08.580> a<00:04:08.610> research

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 
actually does and do we need a research

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.750 
actually does and do we need a research
project<00:04:09.420> for<00:04:09.870> that<00:04:10.020> No<00:04:10.410> we<00:04:10.950> need<00:04:11.100> to<00:04:11.220> stop<00:04:11.520> all

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:11.760 
project for that No we need to stop all

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:14.030 
project for that No we need to stop all
the<00:04:11.880> stupid<00:04:12.330> research<00:04:12.720> if<00:04:13.410> we<00:04:13.620> want<00:04:13.830> to<00:04:13.890> do

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
the stupid research if we want to do

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.860 
the stupid research if we want to do
research<00:04:14.430> we<00:04:14.640> got<00:04:14.760> to<00:04:14.850> do<00:04:14.970> real<00:04:15.209> research<00:04:15.720> and

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:15.870 
research we got to do real research and

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:16.379 
research we got to do real research and
that<00:04:16.080> means

00:04:16.379 --> 00:04:16.389 
that means

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:19.520 
that means
cannot<00:04:16.810> be<00:04:17.069> biased<00:04:18.069> by<00:04:18.310> corporate<00:04:18.879> influence

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530 
cannot be biased by corporate influence

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:20.729 
cannot be biased by corporate influence
okay

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:20.739 
okay

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:24.050 
okay
so<00:04:21.159> the<00:04:21.280> question<00:04:21.639> is<00:04:21.819> who's<00:04:22.419> gonna<00:04:22.629> fund<00:04:22.990> it

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
so the question is who's gonna fund it

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:27.480 
so the question is who's gonna fund it
to<00:04:25.060> your<00:04:25.180> question<00:04:25.740> that's<00:04:26.740> my<00:04:26.979> opinion<00:04:27.249> on

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490 
to your question that's my opinion on

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.849 
to your question that's my opinion on
research
