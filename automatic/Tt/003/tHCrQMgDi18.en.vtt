 attraction alone if there were some things 

00:00:56.949 --> 00:01:01.910

 courage or the work of a madman in addition to 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:22.180
 uncle hid behind saying no no I have 

00:01:19.729 --> 00:01:24.560

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.440
 with a blanket if something happened that 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.940
 fall on top the blanket is going to go up 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.729
 the head to remove a bit of the subject from 

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:40.670
 be a good hero you have to remember a 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:43.390
 phrase that the heroes are in the 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.390
 full cemetery 

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:51.110
 news of current events 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.300
 borders today we can talk to a 

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.800
 Portuguese mother mother 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:57.260
 Portuguese say that it is one of the 

00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:00.820
 largest roller coasters in europe or 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.820
 the biggest that is 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:12.550
 if you think the word samba the 

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:12.550
 means in the language and Malay 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:16.960
 with a cow by sheepskin is not a 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.200
 Indian mass that African says never 

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:21.610
 shambala in Portuguese 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.310
 Many have said that it means ' crime 

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:26.310
 perfect' 

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:30.410
 I was thinking more about roller coaster 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:34.690
 or when there is not much joy at home 

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:36.700
 in French it means something is packed 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:39.060
 but musical about the second war 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.060

 of cockroaches of the Portuguese kingdom 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:56.150
 Kampala is a word completely 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:59.010
 banned there and the Portuguese 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.720
 logically they are not happy you work 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.310
 for something childish what we 

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.600
 we do is help orphan children or 

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:05.430
 who have suffered some type of abuse 

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.470
 we want some of their parents 

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:09.330
 villages of 10 to 12 children without separating 

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.710

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:12.600
