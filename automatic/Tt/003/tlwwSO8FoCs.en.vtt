the<00:02:22.320> process<00:02:22.350> of<00:02:22.950> these<00:02:23.040> guys<00:02:23.280> a<00:02:23.310> little<00:02:23.550> bit

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
the process of these guys a little bit

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.520 
the process of these guys a little bit
the<00:02:23.910> watering<00:02:24.240> can<00:02:24.450> of<00:02:24.570> course<00:02:24.780> increases<00:02:25.380> the

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
the watering can of course increases the

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:31.070 
the watering can of course increases the
tick<00:02:26.000> in<00:02:27.000> a<00:02:27.380> 3x3<00:02:28.380> area<00:02:28.910> so<00:02:29.910> we<00:02:30.390> can<00:02:30.420> pretty

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:31.080 
tick in a 3x3 area so we can pretty

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.810 
tick in a 3x3 area so we can pretty
easily<00:02:31.170> water<00:02:31.680> these<00:02:31.860> guys<00:02:32.160> off<00:02:32.460> get<00:02:32.760> them

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
easily water these guys off get them

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:34.490 
easily water these guys off get them
again<00:02:33.120> I'm<00:02:33.270> growing<00:02:33.690> a<00:02:33.810> little<00:02:34.140> bit<00:02:34.290> quicker

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:34.500 
again I'm growing a little bit quicker

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:37.460 
again I'm growing a little bit quicker
as<00:02:34.800> we<00:02:35.550> saw<00:02:35.790> a<00:02:36.240> couple<00:02:36.480> had<00:02:36.900> a<00:02:36.930> little<00:02:37.170> couple

00:02:37.460 --> 00:02:37.470 
as we saw a couple had a little couple

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.620 
as we saw a couple had a little couple
of<00:02:37.500> bursts<00:02:37.890> of<00:02:37.980> growth<00:02:38.220> there's<00:02:38.490> a<00:02:38.580> 29%<00:02:39.180> there

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:39.630 
of bursts of growth there's a 29% there

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:43.040 
of bursts of growth there's a 29% there
there's<00:02:40.380> a<00:02:40.470> 43%<00:02:41.010> there<00:02:41.610> and<00:02:41.880> you<00:02:42.420> can<00:02:42.630> use<00:02:42.840> your

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
there's a 43% there and you can use your

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.950 
there's a 43% there and you can use your
watering<00:02:43.380> can<00:02:43.710> if<00:02:44.100> you<00:02:44.340> if<00:02:45.240> you<00:02:45.420> water<00:02:45.690> your

minutes<00:02:49.070> you're<00:02:50.070> probably<00:02:50.310> going<00:02:50.700> to<00:02:50.790> have

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
minutes you're probably going to have

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:54.110 
minutes you're probably going to have
some<00:02:50.970> mature<00:02:51.390> plants<00:02:51.870> however<00:02:52.590> there<00:02:53.370> is<00:02:53.730> a

some mature plants however there is a

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.410 
some mature plants however there is a

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:57.420 
much much faster way let's go ahead and

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:59.090 
much much faster way let's go ahead and
knock<00:02:57.570> these<00:02:57.750> plants<00:02:58.200> down<00:02:58.350> then<00:02:58.650> it<00:02:58.770> started

00:02:59.090 --> 00:02:59.100 
knock these plants down then it started

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:05.420 
knock these plants down then it started
to<00:02:59.190> growl<00:03:03.410> get<00:03:04.410> them<00:03:04.530> replanted<00:03:05.070> here<00:03:05.220> real

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
to growl get them replanted here real

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:10.540 
to growl get them replanted here real
quick<00:03:05.640> and<00:03:06.980> we'll<00:03:07.980> take<00:03:08.250> a<00:03:08.280> look<00:03:08.730> at<00:03:08.970> what<00:03:09.300> is<00:03:09.510> a

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:10.550 
quick and we'll take a look at what is a

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:13.790 
quick and we'll take a look at what is a
