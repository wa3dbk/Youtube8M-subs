00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:11.230 
which I think was a case of

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:13.100 
which I think was a case of
misunderstanding

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.110 
misunderstanding

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:15.080

the meantime the building manager had a

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.430 
the meantime the building manager had a

like that but you're the spirit of
cooperation<00:00:41.790> we<00:00:42.420> really<00:00:42.660> just<00:00:42.750> want<00:00:43.020> to<00:00:43.079> be<00:00:43.170> in

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260

need<00:00:43.500> to<00:00:43.590> come<00:00:43.740> out<00:00:43.920> help<00:00:44.160> explain<00:00:44.520> rules<00:00:44.880> they

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:45.540 
need to come out help explain rules they

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.870 
need to come out help explain rules they
did<00:00:45.780> that<00:00:45.960> explained<00:00:46.590> it<00:00:46.800> and<00:00:47.160> almost<00:00:47.700> well

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:47.880 
did that explained it and almost well

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:50.840 
did that explained it and almost well
after<00:00:48.210> that<00:00:48.360> I<00:00:48.690> think<00:00:49.290> by<00:00:50.100> and<00:00:50.280> large<00:00:50.370> where

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
after that I think by and large where

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.130 
after that I think by and large where
people<00:00:51.380> dress<00:00:52.380> us<00:00:52.620> with<00:00:52.650> questions<00:00:53.010> or<00:00:53.870> ask<00:00:54.870> us

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
people dress us with questions or ask us

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.230 
people dress us with questions or ask us
to<00:00:55.260> leave<00:00:55.440> because<00:00:55.620> we<00:00:55.860> don't<00:00:56.010> have<00:00:56.070> a<00:00:56.240> public

00:00:57.230 --> 00:00:57.240 
to leave because we don't have a public

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:59.510 
to leave because we don't have a public
use<00:00:57.390> based<00:00:57.780> permit<00:00:58.170> for<00:00:58.260> that<00:00:58.320> space<00:00:58.710> it's

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
use based permit for that space it's

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:01.040 
use based permit for that space it's
really<00:00:59.730> a<00:00:59.790> case<00:00:59.910> of<00:00:59.970> misunderstanding<00:01:00.870> so<00:01:01.020> I

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
really a case of misunderstanding so I

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:02.630 
really a case of misunderstanding so I
think<00:01:01.170> really<00:01:01.410> education<00:01:02.010> helps<00:01:02.280> and<00:01:02.400> we<00:01:02.460> try

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:02.640 
think really education helps and we try

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:05.630 
think really education helps and we try
to<00:01:02.700> help<00:01:02.850> people<00:01:03.030> out<00:01:03.270> and<00:01:04.010> you<00:01:05.010> know<00:01:05.250> I<00:01:05.280> just

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
to help people out and you know I just

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.429 
to help people out and you know I just
don't<00:01:05.790> I<00:01:05.909> don't<00:01:06.060> think<00:01:06.180> anyone's<00:01:06.509> doing

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
don't I don't think anyone's doing

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:09.410 
don't I don't think anyone's doing
anything<00:01:07.890> out<00:01:08.159> of<00:01:08.310> the<00:01:08.490> mallets<00:01:08.880> and<00:01:09.000> by<00:01:09.240> any

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
anything out of the mallets and by any

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.480 
anything out of the mallets and by any
means<00:01:09.600> he's<00:01:10.380> not<00:01:10.590> in<00:01:10.710> our<00:01:10.740> experience<00:01:11.280> but

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
means he's not in our experience but

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.370 
means he's not in our experience but
that's<00:01:12.420> what<00:01:12.630> the<00:01:12.720> counter<00:01:12.960> that<00:01:12.990> was<00:01:13.140> worst

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
that's what the counter that was worst

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:21.980 
that's what the counter that was worst
for<00:01:13.439> me<00:01:13.530> I<00:01:14.040> think<00:01:14.369> the<00:01:14.759> most<00:01:15.170> fortunate

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.920 

government<00:01:22.990> buildings

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
government buildings

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:29.460 
government buildings
there<00:01:25.170> was<00:01:25.290> a<00:01:25.320> resident<00:01:25.680> that<00:01:25.860> was<00:01:26.070> really

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:29.470 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:31.110 

so<00:01:29.680> we<00:01:29.770> turned<00:01:29.980> off<00:01:30.130> our<00:01:30.280> radio<00:01:30.640> to<00:01:30.850> try<00:01:30.970> and

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:31.120 
so we turned off our radio to try and

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:32.490 
so we turned off our radio to try and
limit<00:01:31.210> our<00:01:31.390> doors<00:01:31.690> you<00:01:31.960> made<00:01:32.080> sure<00:01:32.110> that<00:01:32.410> we

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:32.500 
limit our doors you made sure that we

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:37.260 
limit our doors you made sure that we
had<00:01:32.530> somebody<00:01:32.830> out<00:01:32.980> there<00:01:33.250> directing

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:37.270 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:39.569 

the<00:01:37.689> resident<00:01:38.079> in<00:01:38.439> that<00:01:38.470> way<00:01:39.070> sighs<00:01:39.250> three

00:01:39.569 --> 00:01:39.579 
the resident in that way sighs three

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:41.969 
the resident in that way sighs three
times<00:01:39.850> Houston<00:01:40.390> parking<00:01:40.750> enforcement<00:01:40.979> each

times Houston parking enforcement each

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:45.480 
times Houston parking enforcement each
time<00:01:42.310> we<00:01:42.640> actually<00:01:42.759> knew<00:01:43.090> all<00:01:43.299> this<00:01:43.740> and<00:01:44.740> they

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:55.000 
the day it came to a certain point

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.370 
the day it came to a certain point
to<00:01:56.000> be<00:01:56.120> in<00:01:56.210> the<00:01:56.270> negative<00:01:56.630> impact<00:01:56.990> out<00:01:57.170> there

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380 
to be in the negative impact out there

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.440 
to be in the negative impact out there
and<00:01:58.040> we're<00:01:58.250> really<00:01:58.400> everywhere<00:01:58.940> we<00:01:59.090> go<00:01:59.120> we

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:08.609 
we just went ahead and pack it up
I<00:02:06.210> think<00:02:06.750> the<00:02:06.810> most<00:02:06.960> unfortunate<00:02:07.380> part<00:02:07.830> was

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 
I think the most unfortunate part was

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:12.479 
I think the most unfortunate part was
the<00:02:09.009> resident<00:02:09.459> was<00:02:10.349> you<00:02:11.349> know<00:02:11.470> about<00:02:11.950> language

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:12.489 
the resident was you know about language

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:14.490 
the resident was you know about language
and<00:02:12.760> a<00:02:12.849> lot<00:02:12.970> of<00:02:13.000> the<00:02:13.150> guests<00:02:13.330> not<00:02:13.599> just<00:02:13.989> about

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:14.500 
and a lot of the guests not just about

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.580 
and a lot of the guests not just about
experience<00:02:15.129> at<00:02:15.340> that<00:02:15.550> fortune<00:02:16.060> so<00:02:16.900> you<00:02:17.470> know

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
experience at that fortune so you know

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.530 
experience at that fortune so you know
brats<00:02:17.890> that<00:02:18.250> was<00:02:18.370> the<00:02:18.519> worst<00:02:18.730> because<00:02:19.180> like<00:02:19.420> I

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
brats that was the worst because like I

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.360 
brats that was the worst because like I
said<00:02:19.720> we're<00:02:19.900> really<00:02:20.019> trying<00:02:20.319> to<00:02:20.500> positive<00:02:21.280> a

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:21.370 
said we're really trying to positive a

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.220 
said we're really trying to positive a
couple

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:23.230 
couple

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.949 
couple
have<00:02:23.769> to<00:02:23.920> happen<00:02:24.250> that's<00:02:24.400> a<00:02:24.550> little<00:02:24.760> bit

00:02:26.949 --> 00:02:26.959 

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:29.339 

but<00:02:27.709> I<00:02:27.950> think<00:02:28.159> we<00:02:28.280> met<00:02:28.459> it<00:02:28.579> with<00:02:28.700> a<00:02:28.760> constant

00:02:29.339 --> 00:02:29.349 
but I think we met it with a constant

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:31.509 
but I think we met it with a constant
resolution<00:02:30.349> in<00:02:30.469> the<00:02:30.560> end<00:02:30.739> you<00:02:31.159> know<00:02:31.250> it<00:02:31.400> all<00:02:31.489> I

00:02:31.509 --> 00:02:31.519 
resolution in the end you know it all I

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:33.250 
resolution in the end you know it all I
did<00:02:31.730> know<00:02:31.849> the<00:02:32.000> handshake<00:02:32.599> with<00:02:32.900> the<00:02:33.019> police

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:33.260 
did know the handshake with the police

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.319 
did know the handshake with the police
in<00:02:33.530> parking<00:02:33.890> enforcement<00:02:34.000> and<00:02:35.000> they<00:02:35.120> said

00:02:35.319 --> 00:02:35.329 
in parking enforcement and they said

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:37.360

I<00:03:51.190> just<00:03:51.550> think<00:03:51.910> that<00:03:52.210> they<00:03:52.510> should<00:03:52.720> have

I just think that they should have
better<00:03:53.140> things<00:03:53.200> to<00:03:53.530> do<00:03:53.770> then<00:03:54.070> pick<00:03:54.550> on<00:03:54.700> the

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:02.770 
the problem with it is that I was

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:04.740 
the problem with it is that I was
violating<00:04:03.310> the<00:04:03.400> ice<00:04:03.550> cream<00:04:03.850> truck<00:04:04.000> which<00:04:04.570> is
