00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:04.250
 welcome then dear friends today 

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:06.330
 continue asi our past release 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:09.039
 congratulating two budget sedans 

00:00:09.039 --> 00:00:11.570
 reno hurricane drink everything else 

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:12.840
 yesterday you can get to know 

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.920
 the hero of our tets today we have running 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:16.810
 trials 

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:18.680
 under the hood got us on 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:19.630
 suspended 

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:21.580
 reliable motor-proven 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:25.109
 volume of 1 6 tenths of a capacity of 87 whose 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.439
 stretcher and he is elderly optimal 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:29.140
 city ​​car comfortable 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.369
 network traffic jams due to the high 

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:33.579
 rpm this motor is not picky when 

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:35.430
 gear selection and not so much 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.420
 slow rivals but the chances are for that 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:38.630
 striking 

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:40.360
 understeer that 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.330
 or some degree inherent in everyone in the cabin 

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:43.980
 reception car at the new promenade 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.500
 pretty bright it should say no 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.540
 too bad because even inexperienced 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:49.740
 driver 

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:52.010
 if the machine is trying to turn around perceived 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:53.910
 I know the trajectory that went too far with gas 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.840
 but to dump the gas like logan obediently 

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.860
 rotates on its trajectory 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:00.430
 maybe at low speeds and 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:02.400
 on small irregularities of the French a little 

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.120
 harsh 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.040
 but the main thing we habitually begin is that 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.290
 where there is a good rebound 

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.790
 we can say that even lying 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.620
 the cops but it was easy crush not 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.000
 slowing them down this trick is nothing to 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.040
 Russian tax bumps can start 

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.130
 almost without breaking the road of course this 

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:18.720
 metal is about handling but for 

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.270
 budget car quality 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:21.750
 prices 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.210
 what to say 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.150
 word though does not claim to be 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:26.650
 author's hands 

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:28.390
 but it fits the question completely 

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:28.939
 more 

00:01:28.939 --> 00:01:30.310
 among them are cars 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:33.570
 well let's see what we cooked 

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:35.340
 under the hood italian gasoline engine 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.680
 capacity 4 4 liters 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.860
 70 all men total 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:41.860
 able to accelerate a light car up 

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:43.950
 hundreds in thirteen half seconds and 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:46.430
 reach a maximum speed of 162 kilometers 

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:47.250
 at one o'clock 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.890
 harsh energy-intensive suspension 

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:50.890
 and clearly good feedback 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:52.830
 steering doing carrying 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:54.750
 torrents on smooth asphalt is quite 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:55.840
 decently 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.160
 I must say that yes 

00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.120
 very successful car citroen not 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:00.800
 did so requires no 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.770
 addictive allows you to hell just 

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.370
 to get under way even uphill well maza 

00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:06.860
 want to arrange a car not 

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.350
 equipped with a trip this arose behind 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:11.170
 fresh asphalt is quite understandable and 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:12.739
 predictable 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:14.569
 but now try to let some down 

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:15.429
 totals 

00:02:15.429 --> 00:02:17.219
 in the asset of london spacious lounge 

00:02:17.219 --> 00:02:19.179
 comfortable trunk 

00:02:19.179 --> 00:02:20.289
 practically impenetrable 

00:02:20.289 --> 00:02:22.249
 suspension and excellent handling on 

00:02:22.249 --> 00:02:23.379
 rough roads 

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:24.919
 true all this with a few 

00:02:24.919 --> 00:02:27.040
 ambiguous design after all not 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.359
 convertible trunk well and in 

00:02:29.359 --> 00:02:31.249
 Fiat's assets are more familiar 

00:02:31.249 --> 00:02:32.680
 a little more comfortable 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.109
 Salon and good handling 

00:02:34.109 --> 00:02:36.319
 reversible slightly stiff suspension and 

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:37.949
 higher price 

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:39.879
 however both of these cars possess 

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:41.629
 one very valuable quality 

00:02:41.629 --> 00:02:43.620
 their low price allows many 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:45.590
 Russian Kovtun birch bark without getting into 

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.590
