00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240 
have a new system out right now it's

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.800

game changer truck for mcnellis it's got

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.240 
game changer truck for mcnellis it's got
a<00:01:39.630> little<00:01:39.960> bit<00:01:40.140> different<00:01:40.409> hydraulic<00:01:40.920> system

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:41.250 
a little bit different hydraulic system

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.590 
a little bit different hydraulic system
then<00:01:41.430> people<00:01:41.820> might<00:01:41.850> be<00:01:42.090> used<00:01:42.270> to<00:01:42.390> in<00:01:42.509> the<00:01:42.540> past

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
then people might be used to in the past

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.370 
then people might be used to in the past
so<00:01:43.500> what<00:01:43.799> we've<00:01:43.920> done<00:01:43.950> is<00:01:44.490> had<00:01:45.390> basically<00:01:45.750> both

how we do that we basically gone from

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
these are the actual pumps we have on

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
arm the unique feature about these pumps

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:28.280 
arm the unique feature about these pumps
is<00:03:25.680> that<00:03:25.860> if<00:03:26.130> we<00:03:26.730> don't<00:03:27.030> need<00:03:27.150> hydraulic<00:03:27.660> fluid

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.290 
is that if we don't need hydraulic fluid

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.920 
is that if we don't need hydraulic fluid
to<00:03:28.530> actuate<00:03:29.190> something<00:03:29.519> in<00:03:29.610> our<00:03:29.640> system<00:03:30.000> we

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:30.930 
to actuate something in our system we

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:33.259 
to actuate something in our system we
don't<00:03:31.110> pump<00:03:31.260> it<00:03:31.440> in<00:03:31.590> the<00:03:32.220> past<00:03:32.489> you<00:03:32.820> always<00:03:33.120> had

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
don't pump it in the past you always had

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:35.030 
don't pump it in the past you always had
to<00:03:33.360> pump<00:03:33.510> fluid<00:03:33.780> somewhere<00:03:34.500> in<00:03:34.620> your<00:03:34.680> system

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.040 
to pump fluid somewhere in your system

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:37.009 
to pump fluid somewhere in your system
with<00:03:35.580> these<00:03:35.760> we<00:03:36.000> can<00:03:36.090> basically<00:03:36.239> shut<00:03:36.870> them

00:03:37.009 --> 00:03:37.019 
with these we can basically shut them
