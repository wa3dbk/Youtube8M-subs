I'm<00:01:01.120> gonna<00:01:01.270> go<00:01:01.360> ahead<00:01:01.510> and<00:01:01.660> open<00:01:01.750> it<00:01:02.020> up<00:01:02.170> this

00:01:02.459 --> 00:01:02.469 
I'm gonna go ahead and open it up this

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:06.300 
I'm gonna go ahead and open it up this
is<00:01:02.620> a<00:01:02.649> Carl<00:01:03.190> Zeiss<00:01:03.340> lens<00:01:04.110> on<00:01:05.110> here<00:01:05.409> it's<00:01:05.530> a<00:01:05.560> 25<00:01:06.130> X

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:06.310 
is a Carl Zeiss lens on here it's a 25 X

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.030 
is a Carl Zeiss lens on here it's a 25 X
optical<00:01:06.580> zoom<00:01:06.880> 300<00:01:07.810> X<00:01:07.960> digital<00:01:08.440> zoom<00:01:08.650> it

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:09.040 
optical zoom 300 X digital zoom it

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.700 
optical zoom 300 X digital zoom it
actually<00:01:09.310> is<00:01:09.370> a<00:01:09.430> maximum<00:01:10.000> aperture<00:01:10.390> of<00:01:10.690> 1.8<00:01:11.530> so

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:11.710 
actually is a maximum aperture of 1.8 so

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:13.380 
actually is a maximum aperture of 1.8 so
it<00:01:11.770> can<00:01:11.860> actually<00:01:12.010> get<00:01:12.220> working<00:01:12.490> really

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:13.390 
it can actually get working really

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:14.789 
it can actually get working really
really<00:01:13.659> dark<00:01:13.810> settings<00:01:14.170> it's<00:01:14.260> gonna<00:01:14.380> work<00:01:14.620> and

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:14.799 
really dark settings it's gonna work and

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:17.190

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.429 
impressive another really cool feature
is<00:01:45.310> the<00:01:45.759> image<00:01:46.180> stabilization<00:01:46.570> on<00:01:47.080> the<00:01:47.170> camera

00:01:47.429 --> 00:01:47.439 
is the image stabilization on the camera

00:01:47.439 --> 00:01:50.130 
is the image stabilization on the camera
it<00:01:47.560> has<00:01:47.590> a<00:01:47.710> fully<00:01:48.220> active<00:01:49.049> stabilization<00:01:50.049> it's

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.140 
it has a fully active stabilization it's

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:51.060 
it has a fully active stabilization it's
actually<00:01:50.350> an<00:01:50.409> improvement<00:01:50.470> over<00:01:50.890> the

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:51.070 
actually an improvement over the

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:52.609 
actually an improvement over the
previous<00:01:51.250> Sony<00:01:51.670> systems<00:01:52.060> which<00:01:52.180> are<00:01:52.299> already

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
previous Sony systems which are already

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.200 
previous Sony systems which are already
really<00:01:53.619> really<00:01:53.740> good<00:01:54.130> this<00:01:54.280> one<00:01:54.549> works<00:01:55.030> in

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:55.210 
really really good this one works in

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:57.390 
really really good this one works in
even<00:01:55.570> a<00:01:55.930> better<00:01:56.470> fashion<00:01:56.710> it'll<00:01:57.040> actually<00:01:57.130> do

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:57.400 
even a better fashion it'll actually do

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.490 
even a better fashion it'll actually do
even<00:01:57.670> kill<00:01:58.030> even<00:01:58.270> more<00:01:58.509> motion<00:01:59.049> so<00:01:59.200> you'll<00:01:59.350> see

00:01:59.490 --> 00:01:59.500 
even kill even more motion so you'll see

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.620 
even kill even more motion so you'll see
here<00:01:59.740> I'm<00:02:00.280> gonna<00:02:00.369> point<00:02:00.610> it<00:02:00.729> at<00:02:00.880> my<00:02:01.060> face<00:02:01.270> and

CI<00:04:31.979> Auto<00:04:32.249> it's<00:04:32.729> like<00:04:32.879> a<00:04:32.999> step<00:04:33.300> above<00:04:33.479> regular

00:04:33.949 --> 00:04:33.959 
CI Auto it's like a step above regular

00:04:33.959 --> 00:04:35.419 
CI Auto it's like a step above regular
Auto<00:04:34.319> basically<00:04:34.800> it's<00:04:34.919> gonna<00:04:35.039> go<00:04:35.189> through<00:04:35.369> all

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:35.429 
Auto basically it's gonna go through all
