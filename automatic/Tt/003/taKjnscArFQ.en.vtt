00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:07.419
 a car means freedom I'm not surprised everyone wants 

00:00:08.249 --> 00:00:13.379
 today there are more than 550 million cars in the world and we make 45 million 

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:15.569
 new cars every year 

00:00:15.569 --> 00:00:19.820
 with increasing world prosperity the demand for cars increases in its 

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.820
 factories get more impressive all the time 

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.949
 how cars are mass-produced in one of the most modern 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.019
 world 

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:32.990
 how is it possible 

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:36.690
 tanzi a law is not 70 km north of kuala lampur 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.780
 festival and used to be an impenetrable jungle 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:51.050
 now here is the proud and resplendent own website and soon 

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:54.050
 and will be home to more than two thousand workers 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:00.250
 there is the school of its own site the sports stadium of propositivo the 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:04.320
 campus of the protons haiti university and the mosque on purpose 

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:08.719
 the city began to be built in 1996 

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:12.180
 and she makes more and more posts every year 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.310
 currently producing 150,000 cars per year 

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.210
 the factory own site 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:21.399
 is a very long production line 

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:24.159
 which covers 5 million square meters 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:27.159
 almost equal to seven hundred central cathedrals 

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.420
 everything you need to produce a modern car is on the same roof 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:44.370
 the first ingredient for the post this year is the massive plate 

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:45.390
 metallic 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.390
 all 

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:53.720
 beyond it every day about 20 carlos goes into production 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.200
 klÃ©ber pereira 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.080
 Can be 

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.200
 each of these huge bobaadas makes 20 cases 

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:09.250
 the cylinder of dirt into the four-thousand-ton stamping machine and 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.250
 600 tons 

00:02:18.299 --> 00:02:21.560
 here are cut out the contours of the ports of office 

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:25.989
 one every two seconds 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:29.989
 and it seems to be as easy as it is given pastry figures of pastry 

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:35.229
 the doors then pass through the presence 

00:02:37.109 --> 00:02:40.349
 this is one of the highest Christmas prices in Southeast Asia 

00:02:44.529 --> 00:02:48.589
 meanwhile a kilometer ahead is time for a small army 

00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:51.589
 of robots start to release acids 

00:03:01.529 --> 00:03:05.849
 these games are the ultimate in artificial intelligence creation 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:11.479
 and carried out his task with astonishing dexterity speed and we need 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:18.649
 and in this factory the 180 of them producing 350 cars per day 

00:03:20.099 --> 00:03:23.849
 these new wines take only 20 minutes to mount this chassis 

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:31.370
 the production line to after only eight seconds between each station 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:34.370
 on before moving on 

00:03:41.169 --> 00:03:45.149
 The next step is to protect the car from rust with a phosphate bath. 

00:03:45.149 --> 00:03:48.149
 zinc 

00:03:59.109 --> 00:04:02.869
 then the car is painted by some more artistic games 

00:04:05.839 --> 00:04:08.839
 needless to say they always do it to perfection 

00:04:16.199 --> 00:04:20.069
 and in case some tiny dust particle stains the paint 

00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:25.599
 perfect thousand bright robotic eyes we inspect every angle of every 

00:04:25.599 --> 00:04:26.150
 car 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:30.480
 before it is carried by an invisible mechanical shovel until the next 

00:04:30.479 --> 00:04:33.479
 stage of the process 

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:37.639
 when it was thought that machines could handle the whole process 

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:38.889
 alone 

00:04:38.889 --> 00:04:41.889
 here are some human beings to relieve a little 

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:46.580
 even in the most modern automobile factory you still need engineers 

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:51.370
 skills that require complex coordination and 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:52.509
 lice 

00:04:52.509 --> 00:04:54.840
 So when do you need a man? 

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:58.449
 to get an opinion and impartial let's ask a woman 

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:03.440
 revealed theft is good in what involves heavy parts men are 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:06.440
 good when we have to work in a team 

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:12.580
 finally people released the site together for a strict control check of 

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:14.499
 quality in each car 

00:05:14.499 --> 00:05:17.499
 more than two thousand components are tested 

00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:33.479
 on the last brake test and this car is ready to leave the site ready 

00:05:33.479 --> 00:05:37.789
 it will join the other 550 million cars that keep us going. 

00:05:37.789 --> 00:05:40.789
 development 

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:49.610
 behind objects like those around us and our daily life exist 

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:53.200
 miraculous advances in engineering that separate the mind from time 

00:05:53.949 --> 00:05:58.080
 ingenious solutions to problems that most of us did not even know 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:59.279
 existed 

00:05:59.279 --> 00:06:02.839
 since this program started a refueling plane and has already 

00:06:02.839 --> 00:06:06.989
 transferred enough fuel to maintain an average car by voting for 30 

00:06:06.989 --> 00:06:07.729
 years 

00:06:07.729 --> 00:06:12.479
 ten thousand people are wondering about artificial snow and two thousand and 500 positions 

00:06:12.479 --> 00:06:15.469
 were produced in the month 

00:06:15.469 --> 00:06:20.159
 even the most common things have an extraordinary story to tell 

00:06:20.159 --> 00:06:23.159
 we just have to watch and listen 

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:24.889
