00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:20.670 
and if it was a toxic pollutant which it
wasn't<00:01:18.789> obviously<00:01:19.719> it<00:01:20.289> would<00:01:20.409> have<00:01:20.439> affected

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:20.680 
wasn't obviously it would have affected

I<00:02:07.340> think<00:02:08.030> the<00:02:08.810> Commission<00:02:09.350> said<00:02:09.590> this

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:09.770 
I think the Commission said this

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:11.830 
I think the Commission said this
Saturday<00:02:10.160> night<00:02:10.369> that<00:02:10.759> it<00:02:11.090> began<00:02:11.480> receiving

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
Saturday night that it began receiving

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.220 
Saturday night that it began receiving
reports<00:02:12.350> about<00:02:12.770> dead<00:02:13.040> birds<00:02:13.340> and<00:02:13.930> the<00:02:14.930> birds

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
reports about dead birds and the birds

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:17.770 
reports about dead birds and the birds
only<00:02:15.620> fell<00:02:15.860> over<00:02:16.130> a<00:02:16.160> two<00:02:16.460> kilometer<00:02:17.060> area<00:02:17.360> in

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780 
only fell over a two kilometer area in

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.560 
only fell over a two kilometer area in
an<00:02:18.080> aerial<00:02:18.590> survey<00:02:19.090> indicated<00:02:20.090> that<00:02:20.240> no<00:02:20.420> other

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:20.570 
an aerial survey indicated that no other

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:22.750 
an aerial survey indicated that no other
birds<00:02:20.900> were<00:02:21.140> found<00:02:21.410> out<00:02:21.800> dead<00:02:22.220> outside<00:02:22.430> the

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:22.760 
birds were found out dead outside the

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.670 
birds were found out dead outside the
area<00:02:25.060> so<00:02:26.060> it<00:02:26.150> doesn't<00:02:26.480> really<00:02:26.540> make<00:02:26.780> sense<00:02:26.840> I

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:27.680 
area so it doesn't really make sense I

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.500 
area so it doesn't really make sense I
