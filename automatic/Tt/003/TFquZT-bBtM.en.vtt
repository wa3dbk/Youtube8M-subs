00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.730
 first of all, have fun with the video today 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.930
 we need tuna in our own juice 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.870
 in that case I already have it 

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:50.460
 Drain 

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:51.870
 Then cottage cheese is made of cooked ham 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.200
 I have that in the already was 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:01:00.390
 diced 

00:00:54.200 --> 00:01:02.790
 a paprika onion slightly grated 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:06.470
 Cheese I 'll take it with you today anyway 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:13.670
 data also looks here but also one 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:18.630
 can pizza tomato mushrooms 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:20.550
 pepper powder salt and pepper me 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.540
 thought so the oven to 200 degrees 

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:23.540
 Preheat circulating air 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:28.729
 Now I prepare the low carb pizza dough 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:32.290
 Before we have to first all eggs 

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:32.290
 open and place in a bowl 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.979
 then come the cottage cheese and the 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.979
 Tuna to do so 

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:50.860
 the whole thing is seasoned with paprika powder 

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.860
 pepper approach 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:05.680
 now everything has to be mixed together well 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:09.510
 Now be the dough on with one 

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:09.510
 Baking paper laid sheet 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:14.820
 and then the dough a bit 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.900
 this will be about halfway through 

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:18.240
 be sheet metal 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:21.990
 and that also holds it together though 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:23.580
 she looks so a bit liquid 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:27.000
 whole now looks like ever 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:30.270
 Eaten but after baking is ok 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.960
 quite different from now, the dough can be nice 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.960
 oven 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:43.750
 Now we have to make the champions small 

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.750
 I cut up treasures 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:56.180
 the mushrooms and now I'm done 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:59.350
 the onion continues to be peeled 

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.350
 and then cut small 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:13.510
 the peppers are now also diced 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:37.210
 So the rubber ingredients are now all 

00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:38.950
 ready prepared what I did before unfortunately 

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:40.660
 forgot a list of ingredients is 

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:42.880
 that we still have some rapeseed oil to fry 

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:44.550
 need or any vegetable oil 

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:47.320
 but I hope everyone has it at home 

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:49.570
 I also use that directly 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:51.040
 something in a shame that that 

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:52.270
 get hot and then the 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:55.170
 champions and the onions in it 

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:55.170
 seared 

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:03.340
 The mushrooms are ready when they are so women 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:05.970
 have become and a bit together 

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:05.970
 have fallen 

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:13.910
 I'm freeing the pizza dough now 

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:13.910
 the furnace to prove it afterwards 

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:22.700
 because the pizza dough is so relatively liquid 

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:27.710
 we need a second baking paper 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:27.710
 and have to overturn it now 

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:44.130
 if on your baking sheet so liquid 

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:46.980
 they are definitely laughing 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:52.350
 wipe away with paper before the dough 

00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:54.600
 come back on it when he has the dough 

00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:58.170
 back from wobbly man isolated 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:05:01.760
 can you give up the pizza tomatoes and 

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:01.760
 Afterwards, we will book the pizza for the weather 

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:06.720
 then the champions come on it me 

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:08.640
 By the way, that would not be enough for the covering 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:11.640
 times extra because I think the tiger already 

00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:13.620
 very tasteful and you have to 

00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:15.480
 do not spice up the topping 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:16.980
 but if you like you can 

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:19.460
 of course fresh herbs or something 

00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:19.460
 something on it 

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:25.460
 then also the peppers 

00:05:27.129 --> 00:05:30.029
 give it now 

00:05:30.849 --> 00:05:34.080
 and finally recognize 

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:39.470
 and then a few more minutes in 

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:39.470
 the oven 

00:05:43.469 --> 00:05:51.849
 The pizza is ready and then it came 

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:55.199
 Apparently peace be done is great 

00:05:51.849 --> 00:05:55.199
 delicious pizza 

00:06:02.679 --> 00:06:07.279

00:06:05.569 --> 00:06:08.869
