00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:57.370 
goals and your steps is also pretty good

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:01.890 
goals and your steps is also pretty good
the<00:02:58.370> one<00:02:58.579> thing<00:02:58.849> that<00:02:59.120> we<00:02:59.390> really<00:02:59.690> need<00:03:00.260> is

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:01.900 
the one thing that we really need is

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.920 
the one thing that we really need is
more<00:03:02.900> watch<00:03:03.170> faces<00:03:03.560> so<00:03:03.980> we<00:03:04.010> can<00:03:04.400> get<00:03:04.930> perhaps

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:05.930 
more watch faces so we can get perhaps

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:08.770 
more watch faces so we can get perhaps
the<00:03:06.260> date<00:03:06.500> and<00:03:06.860> other<00:03:07.730> information<00:03:08.090> on<00:03:08.660> the

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:08.780 
the date and other information on the

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:11.910 
the date and other information on the
watch<00:03:09.230> face<00:03:09.470> and<00:03:10.430> then<00:03:11.060> we<00:03:11.299> need<00:03:11.510> some

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:11.920 
watch face and then we need some

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.900 
watch face and then we need some
detailed<00:03:12.920> sleep<00:03:13.459> trapping<00:03:13.970> tracking<00:03:14.660> but

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910 
detailed sleep trapping tracking but

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:19.449 
detailed sleep trapping tracking but
let's<00:03:16.910> see<00:03:17.150> what<00:03:17.420> app<00:03:17.720> hell<00:03:18.139> what<00:03:18.739> the<00:03:18.980> job<00:03:19.280> on

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:19.459 
let's see what app hell what the job on

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:22.150 
let's see what app hell what the job on
has<00:03:19.639> installed<00:03:20.000> for<00:03:20.470> probably<00:03:21.470> than<00:03:21.769> you<00:03:21.980> have

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:22.160 
has installed for probably than you have

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.910 
has installed for probably than you have

for the peple time coming out later this
year<00:03:27.340> now<00:03:28.340> let's<00:03:28.760> take<00:03:29.120> a<00:03:29.150> look<00:03:29.450> at<00:03:29.660> the<00:03:29.959> app

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 
year now let's take a look at the app

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.140 
year now let's take a look at the app
fitness<00:03:31.190> app<00:03:31.430> itself

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:32.150

this it syncs with the watch and the

watch and the sleep count is manually

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:08.319 
watch and the sleep count is manually
set<00:04:01.720> because<00:04:02.720> as<00:04:03.500> of<00:04:03.799> yet<00:04:04.040> the<00:04:05.829> up<00:04:06.829> app<00:04:07.609> for

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:08.329 
set because as of yet the up app for

00:04:08.329 --> 00:04:10.900 
set because as of yet the up app for
pebble<00:04:08.720> does<00:04:09.380> not<00:04:09.620> support<00:04:10.069> sleep<00:04:10.519> tracking

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:10.910 
pebble does not support sleep tracking

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:13.240 
pebble does not support sleep tracking
so<00:04:11.209> you<00:04:11.269> have<00:04:11.510> to<00:04:11.630> do<00:04:11.780> it<00:04:11.870> manually<00:04:12.260> you<00:04:13.220> have

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.250 
so you have to do it manually you have

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:17.319 
so you have to do it manually you have
somewhat<00:04:14.680> half<00:04:15.680> awesome<00:04:16.190> automatic<00:04:17.000> sleep

00:04:17.319 --> 00:04:17.329 
somewhat half awesome automatic sleep

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:19.960 
somewhat half awesome automatic sleep
tracking<00:04:17.870> with<00:04:18.019> the<00:04:18.169> Pebble<00:04:18.560> watch<00:04:18.970> because

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:19.970 
tracking with the Pebble watch because

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:23.020 
tracking with the Pebble watch because
when<00:04:20.690> you<00:04:20.810> wake<00:04:20.959> up<00:04:20.989> in<00:04:21.260> the<00:04:21.409> morning<00:04:21.799> the<00:04:22.159> up

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:23.030 
when you wake up in the morning the up

00:04:23.030 --> 00:04:26.300 
when you wake up in the morning the up
app<00:04:23.539> will<00:04:23.990> pop<00:04:24.500> up<00:04:24.650> and<00:04:24.890> ask<00:04:25.070> you<00:04:25.460> if<00:04:25.669> you<00:04:26.000> were

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
app will pop up and ask you if you were

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:29.810 
app will pop up and ask you if you were
sleep<00:04:26.639> between<00:04:27.830> sometime<00:04:28.830> list<00:04:29.130> last<00:04:29.639> night

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:29.820 
sleep between sometime list last night

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:33.920 
sleep between sometime list last night
and<00:04:30.270> sometimes<00:04:30.600> this<00:04:30.990> morning<00:04:31.410> and<00:04:32.060> I<00:04:33.060> believe

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:33.930 
and sometimes this morning and I believe

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:39.800 
and sometimes this morning and I believe
it's<00:04:34.169> it<00:04:35.010> is<00:04:35.160> using<00:04:35.730> the<00:04:38.360> accelerometer<00:04:39.360> in

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:39.810 
it's it is using the accelerometer in

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:41.830 
it's it is using the accelerometer in
the<00:04:39.900> watch<00:04:40.080> to<00:04:40.380> tell<00:04:40.620> if<00:04:40.830> you<00:04:41.040> sleep<00:04:41.580> or<00:04:41.790> not

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:41.840 
the watch to tell if you sleep or not

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:44.570 
the watch to tell if you sleep or not
but<00:04:42.840> it<00:04:43.050> cannot<00:04:43.380> track<00:04:43.919> if<00:04:44.100> you<00:04:44.250> have<00:04:44.400> been

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.580 
but it cannot track if you have been

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:48.020 
but it cannot track if you have been
sleeping<00:04:45.090> light<00:04:45.330> or<00:04:45.980> you<00:04:46.980> have<00:04:47.100> been<00:04:47.280> sound

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.030 
sleeping light or you have been sound

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:51.470 
sleeping light or you have been sound
asleep<00:04:48.180> so<00:04:48.960> it<00:04:49.560> is<00:04:49.800> only<00:04:50.010> and<00:04:50.400> start<00:04:50.970> and<00:04:51.210> stop

00:04:51.470 --> 00:04:51.480 
asleep so it is only and start and stop

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:54.020 
asleep so it is only and start and stop
time<00:04:51.750> for<00:04:51.780> your<00:04:52.260> sleep<00:04:52.530> cycles<00:04:53.040> but<00:04:53.790> it

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:54.030 
time for your sleep cycles but it

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:57.470 
time for your sleep cycles but it
actually<00:04:54.389> works<00:04:54.860> pretty<00:04:55.860> well<00:04:56.150> tracking<00:04:57.150> your

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:57.480 
actually works pretty well tracking your

00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:01.000 
actually works pretty well tracking your
activities<00:04:58.520> when<00:04:59.520> you<00:04:59.729> do<00:05:00.030> something<00:05:00.570> that

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:01.010 
activities when you do something that

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:06.320 
activities when you do something that
there's<00:05:02.010> a<00:05:02.160> bit<00:05:02.460> more<00:05:02.729> than<00:05:04.010> usually<00:05:05.120> the<00:05:06.120> app

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:06.330 
there's a bit more than usually the app

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:11.240 
there's a bit more than usually the app
will<00:05:07.460> just<00:05:08.460> have<00:05:08.639> to<00:05:08.700> find<00:05:08.820> it<00:05:09.240> like<00:05:09.990> this<00:05:10.290> will

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:11.250 
will just have to find it like this will

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:14.450 
will just have to find it like this will
pop<00:05:11.639> up<00:05:11.820> and<00:05:12.210> ask<00:05:12.960> if<00:05:13.350> you<00:05:13.560> did<00:05:13.740> an<00:05:13.919> activity

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:14.460 
pop up and ask if you did an activity

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:18.140 
pop up and ask if you did an activity
and<00:05:14.700> it<00:05:15.300> will<00:05:15.510> have<00:05:15.870> locked<00:05:16.229> the<00:05:16.770> time<00:05:17.150> for

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:18.150 
and it will have locked the time for

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:21.020 
and it will have locked the time for
instance<00:05:18.479> did<00:05:19.110> you<00:05:19.410> do<00:05:20.160> something<00:05:20.490> between

00:05:21.020 --> 00:05:21.030 
instance did you do something between

00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:25.670 
instance did you do something between
10:00<00:05:21.330> and<00:05:21.360> 11:00<00:05:22.139> p.m.<00:05:22.169> and<00:05:23.900> you<00:05:24.900> can<00:05:24.930> see<00:05:25.380> in
