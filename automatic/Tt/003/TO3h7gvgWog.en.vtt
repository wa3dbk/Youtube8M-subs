two<00:00:20.939> or<00:00:21.060> three<00:00:21.090> different<00:00:21.449> ideas<00:00:21.660> and<00:00:25.130> they

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
two or three different ideas and they

kind of sucked but I came up with an

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.650 
kind of sucked but I came up with an
idea<00:00:30.630> this<00:00:30.929> morning<00:00:31.170> and<00:00:31.850> it's<00:00:32.850> pretty<00:00:33.149> simple

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660

this is Gorilla Tape and it works fairly

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.999 
this is Gorilla Tape and it works fairly
well<00:01:31.799> it<00:01:32.460> works<00:01:32.640> very<00:01:32.880> well<00:01:33.320> but<00:01:34.320> duct<00:01:34.829> tape

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
well it works very well but duct tape

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:40.219 
well it works very well but duct tape
will<00:01:35.159> work<00:01:36.590> so<00:01:37.590> what<00:01:37.799> you<00:01:37.950> need<00:01:38.100> to<00:01:38.220> do<00:01:38.400> is<00:01:39.229> grab

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
will work so what you need to do is grab

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:45.980 
will work so what you need to do is grab
your<00:01:40.259> headband<00:01:41.899> place<00:01:42.899> it<00:01:43.140> inside<00:01:44.750> or<00:01:45.750> outside

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:45.990 
your headband place it inside or outside

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.069 
your headband place it inside or outside
I<00:01:46.229> guess<00:01:46.740> it<00:01:46.860> doesn't<00:01:47.009> really<00:01:47.220> matter<00:01:48.079> what

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
I guess it doesn't really matter what

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.760 
I guess it doesn't really matter what
you<00:01:49.259> really<00:01:49.409> want<00:01:49.649> to<00:01:49.740> do<00:01:49.890> is<00:01:50.189> you<00:01:50.430> want<00:01:50.670> to

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
you really want to do is you want to

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.460 
you really want to do is you want to
measure<00:01:52.770> how<00:01:52.950> far<00:01:53.720> how<00:01:54.720> much<00:01:54.930> you<00:01:55.049> need<00:01:55.200> to<00:01:55.290> cut

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
measure how far how much you need to cut

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.050 
measure how far how much you need to cut
off<00:01:55.590> of<00:01:55.619> your<00:01:55.920> headband<00:01:56.250> because<00:01:56.369> on<00:01:56.670> the

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
off of your headband because on the

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.990 
off of your headband because on the
headband<00:01:57.390> that<00:01:57.509> I<00:01:57.570> had<00:01:57.840> was<00:01:58.530> too<00:01:58.740> long<00:01:58.939> and<00:01:59.939> so

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
headband that I had was too long and so

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.120 
headband that I had was too long and so
I<00:02:00.180> had<00:02:00.329> to<00:02:00.360> cut<00:02:00.570> it<00:02:00.600> off<00:02:00.780> I<00:02:01.079> had<00:02:01.740> to<00:02:01.770> cut<00:02:01.979> off<00:02:02.100> a

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130 
I had to cut it off I had to cut off a

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:06.440 
I had to cut it off I had to cut off a
piece<00:02:02.520> from<00:02:02.759> each<00:02:02.939> end<00:02:03.149> and<00:02:04.850> the<00:02:05.850> reason<00:02:06.270> for

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
piece from each end and the reason for

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.869 
piece from each end and the reason for
this<00:02:06.600> is<00:02:06.899> so<00:02:07.110> you<00:02:07.170> can<00:02:07.469> so<00:02:07.979> you<00:02:08.039> can<00:02:08.099> still<00:02:08.520> you

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
this is so you can so you can still you

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:11.720 
this is so you can so you can still you
know<00:02:09.030> adjust<00:02:09.920> otherwise<00:02:10.920> you<00:02:11.190> just<00:02:11.220> you<00:02:11.640> don't

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
know adjust otherwise you just you don't

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.020 
know adjust otherwise you just you don't
have<00:02:11.910> a<00:02:11.940> fixed<00:02:12.300> type<00:02:12.450> end<00:02:12.690> you

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
have a fixed type end you

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.660 
have a fixed type end you
that's<00:02:13.510> what<00:02:13.660> I<00:02:13.720> was<00:02:13.810> trying<00:02:13.990> to<00:02:14.050> avoid<00:02:14.670> it's

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670

of<00:04:48.860> there<00:04:53.410> look<00:04:55.420> so<00:04:56.420> that<00:04:56.570> alone<00:04:56.810> already<00:04:57.230> kind

00:04:57.490 --> 00:04:57.500 
of there look so that alone already kind

00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:03.550 
of there look so that alone already kind
of<00:04:57.560> just<00:04:57.740> fixed<00:04:58.010> the<00:04:58.130> problem<00:04:58.580> but<00:05:02.410> you<00:05:03.410> know

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:03.560 
of just fixed the problem but you know

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:05.080 
of just fixed the problem but you know
I'm<00:05:03.680> doing<00:05:03.950> it<00:05:04.010> to<00:05:04.190> the<00:05:04.280> whole<00:05:04.460> headband<00:05:04.940> that

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:05.090 
I'm doing it to the whole headband that

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:16.620 
I'm doing it to the whole headband that
way<00:05:07.900> you<00:05:08.900> know<00:05:09.020> it's<00:05:09.200> extra<00:05:09.590> extra<00:05:10.310> strength

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:16.630 

00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:20.520 

um<00:05:17.630> it's<00:05:18.530> obviously<00:05:18.980> not<00:05:19.130> that<00:05:19.340> Center<00:05:19.700> but

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:20.530 
um it's obviously not that Center but

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:37.630 
um it's obviously not that Center but
you<00:05:21.530> know<00:05:21.710> it<00:05:22.430> works

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:37.640 

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:41.570 

so<00:05:38.640> on<00:05:38.910> this<00:05:39.420> alone<00:05:39.780> right<00:05:40.050> here<00:05:40.400> this<00:05:41.400> is

00:05:41.570 --> 00:05:41.580 
so on this alone right here this is

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:44.930 
so on this alone right here this is
pretty<00:05:41.940> much<00:05:42.090> fixed<00:05:42.570> on<00:05:43.370> for<00:05:44.370> the<00:05:44.430> purpose<00:05:44.760> of

00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:44.940 
pretty much fixed on for the purpose of

00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:48.560 
pretty much fixed on for the purpose of
keeping<00:05:45.180> this<00:05:45.420> video<00:05:45.690> short<00:05:46.050> or<00:05:46.770> shorter<00:05:47.570> I'm

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:48.570 
keeping this video short or shorter I'm

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:51.400 
keeping this video short or shorter I'm
just<00:05:48.780> going<00:05:48.900> to<00:05:48.930> leave<00:05:49.080> it<00:05:49.140> at<00:05:49.260> that<00:05:49.440> but<00:05:49.740> you

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:51.410

going<00:05:54.690> to<00:05:54.750> sound<00:05:54.960> exactly<00:05:55.050> like<00:05:55.620> when<00:05:55.770> you

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:55.800 
going to sound exactly like when you

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:03.690 
these other ideas and what sucks about

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:05.390 
these other ideas and what sucks about
them<00:06:03.990> is<00:06:04.080> that<00:06:04.170> when<00:06:04.350> you<00:06:04.470> when<00:06:04.800> you<00:06:04.920> put<00:06:05.310> them
