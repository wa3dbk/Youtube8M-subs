00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:09.049
 good good good good good good 

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:17.820
 Hi guys, it's okay, just play in the church. 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.640
 Are you watching my picture? 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.590
 fish journey where throughout this month 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.750
 I'm passing on several tips on 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.099
 nutrition and supplementation aimed 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:29.220
 weight loss 

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:31.050
 today will be a special tip on the 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.600
 protein supplementation, ie 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.140
 more efficient and effective supplementation 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.930
 exist 

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:40.230
 let's start with the famous and popular 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:43.410
 most dearest of all is protein 

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:45.840
 is a supplementation is based on protein 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.030
 whey or even sticking 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.850
 the serum of the retina milk that takes only source 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:53.850
 protein and transforms all 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.910
 they are powdered without taste etc. 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:00.120
 and what is the differential of what he has 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:03.239
 rapid digestion and absorption, ie you 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:06.119
 takes that protein quickly and is 

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.549
 degraded in amino acids and goes where 

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.049
 you need to promote blood for 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:12.869
 fabrics etc. 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:16.670
 the industry has basically three 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:19.650
 gil titles and the o and concentrated to i 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:21.180
 isolated and hydrolyzed to my god 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.470
 Any difference, huh? 

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.210
 the first one has a little difference in 

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.549
 production and secondly, there is 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:28.740
 price and concentrated would be the 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.750
 that is to say, taken from the serum of 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.630
 hydration or powder ready the book 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.009
 has rough has a little carbohydrate 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:38.009
 little fat 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:40.799
 the industry goes there and gives a refined 

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:43.470
 in this 8 has concentrated and saw there pro 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:46.200
 has isolated the carbohydrate 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.299
 had alternative to lactose take everything 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.640
 who has kind of back in 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:53.610
 roughly what is a better product is 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:56.189
 for so it is pure and there comes the 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.979
 hydrolyzed huawei which is a kind of well 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:00.899
 of course you can see that it is 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.909
 differentiated protein is more expensive and 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:06.840
 with the difference it her 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:08.530
 they take the isolated and break this law 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.509
 in order to facilitate 

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.000
 but it is management or when you take a 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:15.790
 is hydrolyzed protein you practically 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.830
 is acting pure amino acids you take 

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:20.650
 that at the moment it is time for the young man to take the 

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:22.840
 blood is totally who already took know 

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.340
 when you take a dose or hydrolyze 

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.319
 for you to drink a glass of water 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:28.810
 You do not feel anything. The management is super. 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:31.090
 ultra mega fast then it is very indicated 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.500
 for those who have stomach trouble to 

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.989
 who has a sad look for who to drink 

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:36.670
 and you feel badly had in the stomach or to 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:39.010
 higher performance athletes is 

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:41.530
 one thing that really has great 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:42.250
 digestion and absorption there by passing a 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:45.310
 forward 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:47.650
 we have a blend, it would be a mixture of 

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.450
 there are many versions of the 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:51.310
 promising market for various types of 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:54.790
 this protein is a mixture of 

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:57.069
 caffeine with the protein and combines 

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:59.410
 the purpose of these patients in these mix 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:02.739
 protein is different type of absorption 

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:05.290
 in a product only you take the first one 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:07.720
 then albumin and finally the 

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.400
 casein for example is pretty cool because 

00:03:07.720 --> 00:03:11.980
 you maintain that amino acid profile 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.900
 in your blood for longer 

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.600
 I do not have it here because I do not use it 

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:19.120
 taste but also has something to mine 

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:21.459
 moment is egg white protein 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:24.370
 it comes right mind - to dehydrate 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:26.230
 the egg becomes a powder and the 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:28.450
 It's very slow, it's pretty cool to 

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:30.459
 take the night as well as caffeine and 

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:33.220
 to finalize a protein that neither 

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:35.079
 market novelty supplementation 

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.120
 abroad as here in Brazil that the 

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:38.859
 meat protein is the protein in meat 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.650
 is that we talk about what is the 

00:03:38.859 --> 00:03:43.090
 powerful kiss is the guy and I go in the versions 

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:45.609
 american 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:47.650
 they take the protein in beef 

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:51.100
 even if they take that protein 

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:52.989
 dehydration and make the right powder is well 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:55.390
 Legal also fast protein management 

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:58.120
 alone is slightly more concentrated in 

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:59.769
 iron to give if then so has 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.230
 very cool results have not been 

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:03.549
 contains new and much newer than in 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:04.420
 it's a way you go to your 

00:04:03.549 --> 00:04:06.489
 Implementation 

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:08.739
 it's not that it's better or worse than enem 

00:04:06.489 --> 00:04:11.220
 no, she's just different, she comes the taste 

00:04:08.739 --> 00:04:13.750
 chocolate but the market already 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:15.850
 have released some of the flavors do not have 

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:16.560
 meat flavor itabom people then this is 

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:19.620
 the difference 

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:21.630
 is among the most common types of 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:23.700
 common in our diet so I use I 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:26.250
 I recommend it because it is an excellent product 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:28.410
 For you both gain mass and burn 

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:29.550
 fat and maintain your muscle mass 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:32.840
 It's good, I hope you liked it. 

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:32.840
 the alloy is more
