that first of all it's gonna be a

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.440 
that first of all it's gonna be a
continuation<00:02:38.520> after<00:02:38.940> the<00:02:39.030> movies<00:02:39.270> because

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:39.450 
continuation after the movies because

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:41.240 
continuation after the movies because
you<00:02:39.540> know<00:02:39.630> Frieza<00:02:39.930> himself<00:02:40.440> well<00:02:40.920> the<00:02:41.100> last

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 
you know Frieza himself well the last

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.460 
you know Frieza himself well the last
time<00:02:41.460> before<00:02:41.820> this<00:02:42.000> was<00:02:42.270> when<00:02:42.660> he<00:02:42.690> was<00:02:42.900> in<00:02:43.320> the

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
time before this was when he was in the

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.650 
time before this was when he was in the
freezer<00:02:43.710> saga<00:02:44.010> at<00:02:44.250> fresh<00:02:44.430> android<00:02:44.850> saga<00:02:45.120> so

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:45.660 
freezer saga at fresh android saga so

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:47.990 
freezer saga at fresh android saga so
there's<00:02:46.530> only<00:02:46.740> one<00:02:46.890> real<00:02:47.280> way<00:02:47.310> that<00:02:47.790> that

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
there's only one real way that that

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.850 
there's only one real way that that
would<00:02:48.390> actually<00:02:48.630> make<00:02:48.720> any<00:02:48.900> sense<00:02:49.110> is<00:02:49.290> if<00:02:49.620> it's

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
would actually make any sense is if it's

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:51.710 
would actually make any sense is if it's
after<00:02:50.220> a<00:02:50.250> resurrection<00:02:50.790> act<00:02:50.940> and<00:02:51.150> it<00:02:51.540> makes

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
after a resurrection act and it makes

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:52.910 
after a resurrection act and it makes
sense<00:02:51.900> because<00:02:52.080> there<00:02:52.350> is<00:02:52.470> still<00:02:52.709> a<00:02:52.770> little

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:52.920 
sense because there is still a little

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:54.949 
sense because there is still a little
bit<00:02:53.070> more<00:02:53.310> time<00:02:53.550> before<00:02:53.730> the<00:02:54.090> technical<00:02:54.510> world

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
bit more time before the technical world

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:56.420 
bit more time before the technical world
tournament<00:02:55.350> saga<00:02:55.560> is<00:02:55.680> supposed<00:02:55.890> to<00:02:55.950> happen<00:02:56.130> in

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
tournament saga is supposed to happen in

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.400 
tournament saga is supposed to happen in
Dragon<00:02:56.760> Ball<00:02:56.790> Z<00:02:57.150> so<00:02:57.690> you<00:02:58.020> know<00:02:58.110> they<00:02:58.260> still

00:02:58.400 --> 00:02:58.410 
Dragon Ball Z so you know they still

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:00.410 
Dragon Ball Z so you know they still
have<00:02:58.470> a<00:02:58.590> little<00:02:58.709> bit<00:02:58.860> of<00:02:58.890> time<00:02:59.160> in<00:02:59.430> between<00:02:59.490> the

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:00.420 
have a little bit of time in between the

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.690 
have a little bit of time in between the
end<00:03:00.600> of<00:03:00.840> Resurrection<00:03:01.410> F<00:03:01.590> and<00:03:01.800> the<00:03:02.340> actual

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
end of Resurrection F and the actual

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:04.280 
end of Resurrection F and the actual
world<00:03:03.209> tournament<00:03:03.600> saga<00:03:03.780> so<00:03:04.020> it<00:03:04.110> makes<00:03:04.260> a

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
world tournament saga so it makes a

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.020 
world tournament saga so it makes a
little<00:03:04.350> bit<00:03:04.470> of<00:03:04.620> sense<00:03:04.830> I<00:03:05.459> don't<00:03:05.760> know<00:03:05.850> how

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
little bit of sense I don't know how

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:07.250 
little bit of sense I don't know how
they're<00:03:06.180> gonna<00:03:06.240> really<00:03:06.450> squeeze<00:03:06.810> all<00:03:07.050> of<00:03:07.080> the

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:07.260 
they're gonna really squeeze all of the

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.050 
they're gonna really squeeze all of the
time<00:03:07.860> cuz<00:03:08.070> you<00:03:08.160> know<00:03:08.310> I'm<00:03:08.459> assuming<00:03:08.610> this<00:03:08.940> is

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:09.060 
time cuz you know I'm assuming this is

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:10.280 
time cuz you know I'm assuming this is
gonna<00:03:09.150> be<00:03:09.300> a<00:03:09.330> longer<00:03:09.570> anime<00:03:09.930> because<00:03:10.080> you<00:03:10.200> know

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:10.290 
gonna be a longer anime because you know

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:12.350 
gonna be a longer anime because you know
it's<00:03:10.530> Dragon<00:03:11.040> Ball<00:03:11.190> Z<00:03:11.370> it's<00:03:11.730> shown<00:03:12.000> in<00:03:12.030> so

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
it's Dragon Ball Z it's shown in so

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.390 
it's Dragon Ball Z it's shown in so
usually<00:03:12.840> those<00:03:12.990> are<00:03:13.020> long<00:03:13.380> I'm<00:03:13.890> assuming<00:03:14.280> it's

00:03:14.390 --> 00:03:14.400 
usually those are long I'm assuming it's

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:15.680 
usually those are long I'm assuming it's
gonna<00:03:14.459> be<00:03:14.700> probably<00:03:14.970> a<00:03:15.180> little<00:03:15.300> bit<00:03:15.480> more<00:03:15.600> than

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:15.690 
gonna be probably a little bit more than

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:18.020 
gonna be probably a little bit more than
100<00:03:15.990> episodes<00:03:16.320> if<00:03:16.470> not<00:03:16.650> 100-200<00:03:17.370> so<00:03:17.760> I<00:03:17.910> don't

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:18.030 
100 episodes if not 100-200 so I don't

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:18.979 
100 episodes if not 100-200 so I don't
know<00:03:18.120> how<00:03:18.209> they're<00:03:18.300> gonna<00:03:18.360> squeeze<00:03:18.660> all<00:03:18.810> into

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
know how they're gonna squeeze all into

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:21.080 
know how they're gonna squeeze all into
that<00:03:19.080> one<00:03:19.260> little<00:03:19.470> time<00:03:19.709> but<00:03:20.280> maybe<00:03:20.910> they'll

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
that one little time but maybe they'll

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:22.400 
that one little time but maybe they'll
do<00:03:21.209> a<00:03:21.239> time<00:03:21.450> skip<00:03:21.690> after<00:03:22.170> the<00:03:22.260> world

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410
