 I do not want to see you that day 

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.219

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.539
 I do not care that completely 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.100
 but you want that routine 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:04.290

 It's perfect for lunch or dinner 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:17.220
 No matter when I wish you five 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.290
 minutes of your life is investing in it 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.939
 that she does something full body that he does 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.619
 you can train my video for 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:24.420
 take inspiration is the last video 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.070
 what I posted even if you 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:27.750
 of which five minutes creates then you have 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.600
 definitely a good one 

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.590
 Pensum met and something to do every day 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:34.829
 to do a body 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:37.470
 the second tip is you should 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:39.060
 calories are so exciting that you too 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.530
 chicken may you can either 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:43.350
 actually decided and where you 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.659
 so to speak, the whole week goes by 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.310
 not standing and no sweets he is 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:51.950
 and no unhealthy stuff is and then 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:54.540
 a day completely by first or 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:56.850
 save you the calories list 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.219
 a little bit of chocolate sweets 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.439
 Anyway what I like about that 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:03.450
 Do not eat too late if your fruits are 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:04.950
 Because fruits are very important and that 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.710
 is the transition to the 3 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:10.349
 Tip then made sure that you 're up 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.660
 14 o'clock have completed the 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:15.390
 Blood sugar levels are more serious 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.310
 as identical blood sugar baby den 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.200
 You have to hold down and he must not 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.730
 going too far up there will be otherwise 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.920
 solid education too 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.959
 I have a lot to tell you about this topic 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.870
 already in another video which 

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:29.400
 I called in the infobox with a performance 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.959
 all your information also needs 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:32.730
 are in mirrors and like me so much 

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:34.260
 lost weight I have right 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.390
 lost a lot of weight and that has on 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.620
 every case with the note of the 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.260
 time to do 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:42.390
 I just have some sweet drinks 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.989
 until a certain time i 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.769
 drunk 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:48.120
 but then it is very important that you 

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:50.160
 really seeing to it that if you 

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.989
 fruits he is when you sweet things 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:56.390
 She may have eaten until 2pm 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:03:00.690
 and then no , why? 

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:03.650
 hello one knows a new one for sure 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:05.370
 protein-rich food is ok 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.590
 It should be high in protein 

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:10.980
 for the evening and I too much that is 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:18.630
 most importantly, the next tip relates 

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:19.680
 insist that you rethink for it 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:21.120
 If you are in the restaurant 

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.889
 lunch break for example a restaurant 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.480
 go and lunch today and 

00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:27.690
 usually always the passwords for 

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:30.299
 have you standing then you are thinking now 

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:32.489
 first eight so that you your calorie 

00:03:30.299 --> 00:03:36.600
 can save for maybe that 

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:38.400
 what comes to him after work or when 

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:40.079
 you have already allowed to have breakfast 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.450
 already eaten on peanut butter and 

00:03:40.079 --> 00:03:44.790
 your super craig and a hearty one 

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:48.090
 Breakfast with quite a lot of good train 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:50.310
 For lunch maybe a salad if you 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:52.079
 nu de l'est or pasta is then likely 

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:53.760
 not fit again in the evening 

00:03:52.079 --> 00:03:56.099
 please do me the eighth please 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:59.549
 think about when he goes to the restaurant and 

00:03:56.099 --> 00:04:00.989
 my schnitzel it then tries the 

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:02.069
 accompany you with food but only 

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:04.109
 The schnitzel you know what I mean 

00:04:02.069 --> 00:04:05.790
 is with the team is thinking about it 

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:07.709
 rethink and if you know and know 

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:09.480
 that pizza you order 

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:11.220
 not good for you then you have 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:13.140
 too many calories and then you have 

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:15.930
 just too much weight on the scales 

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:17.940
 if you like how then let the pizza 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:20.519
 away and take somehow something else 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.900
 so pc then tries the real one 

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:26.640
 Somehow the evening goes on completely 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:30.510
 delicious delicious vegetables to eat 

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:31.890
 serviced vegetables nice soup I have to 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:34.200

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:37.200
 Show dishes I'm right there 

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:39.360
 cook good soft always yourself 

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:40.919
 in the meantime and that is also uplifting 

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:43.770
 each case to my super figure 

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:46.020
 because then I know something on the 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:47.849
 I know exactly what I eat 

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:49.860
 but swam over it 

00:04:47.849 --> 00:04:53.370
 be sure to pay attention when you are in the 

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:56.070
 restaurant riva sure that you if you 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:57.960

00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:00.030
 okay and think with you and deal with them 

00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:02.849
 it is in the motto at last one 

00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:04.500
 tip that I can give again and again 

00:05:02.849 --> 00:05:07.469
 and then I repeat myself 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:10.289
 probably for the thousandth time 

00:05:07.469 --> 00:05:13.530
 On foot not so much car but drive 

00:05:10.289 --> 00:05:15.330
 Bike goes up stairs 

00:05:13.530 --> 00:05:17.219
 moves you go with the dog gassi 

00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:18.900
 Do not let someone else do it for you 

00:05:17.219 --> 00:05:19.920

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:40.890
 not as much 

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:42.060
