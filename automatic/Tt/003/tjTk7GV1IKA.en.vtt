closure right here is 10 inches and then

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:36.470 
closure right here is 10 inches and then
I<00:00:33.579> have<00:00:33.820> 12<00:00:34.210> 14<00:00:34.930> and<00:00:34.960> 16<00:00:35.320> inches<00:00:35.860> layered

I have 12 14 and 16 inches layered

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.540 
I have 12 14 and 16 inches layered
basically<00:00:37.480> so<00:00:37.840> the<00:00:38.290> shortest<00:00:38.680> at<00:00:38.860> the<00:00:39.010> top<00:00:39.250> and

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:39.550 
basically so the shortest at the top and

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:40.889 
basically so the shortest at the top and
then<00:00:39.670> the<00:00:39.790> longest<00:00:40.149> at<00:00:40.239> the<00:00:40.359> bottom<00:00:40.690> and

00:00:40.889 --> 00:00:40.899 
then the longest at the bottom and

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:42.419 
then the longest at the bottom and
that's<00:00:40.960> going<00:00:41.170> to<00:00:41.230> give<00:00:41.379> me<00:00:41.530> some<00:00:41.800> natural

00:00:42.419 --> 00:00:42.429 
that's going to give me some natural

00:00:42.429 --> 00:00:44.939 
that's going to give me some natural
layering<00:00:43.179> I<00:00:43.420> also<00:00:43.870> created<00:00:44.320> a<00:00:44.500> u-part<00:00:44.920> wig

00:00:44.939 --> 00:00:44.949 
layering I also created a u-part wig

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:47.069 
layering I also created a u-part wig
with<00:00:45.250> this<00:00:45.399> hair<00:00:45.640> and<00:00:45.850> I<00:00:45.910> have<00:00:45.940> a<00:00:46.059> video<00:00:46.449> on<00:00:46.539> how

00:00:47.069 --> 00:00:47.079 
with this hair and I have a video on how

00:00:47.079 --> 00:00:49.290 
with this hair and I have a video on how
to<00:00:47.140> create<00:00:47.320> part<00:00:47.769> wigs<00:00:47.980> but<00:00:48.730> instead<00:00:49.210> of

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:49.300 
to create part wigs but instead of

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.509 
to create part wigs but instead of
actually<00:00:49.660> cutting<00:00:49.899> out<00:00:50.109> the<00:00:50.260> you<00:00:50.469> I<00:00:50.859> just

00:00:51.509 --> 00:00:51.519 
actually cutting out the you I just

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:53.520 
actually cutting out the you I just
added<00:00:51.850> the<00:00:52.179> closure<00:00:52.449> so<00:00:52.839> I<00:00:52.899> guess<00:00:53.079> it's<00:00:53.260> not

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:53.530 
added the closure so I guess it's not

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.340 
added the closure so I guess it's not
really<00:00:53.589> a<00:00:53.980> new<00:00:54.280> part<00:00:54.579> wig<00:00:54.760> as<00:00:54.969> much<00:00:55.210> as<00:00:55.510> a<00:00:55.899> full

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:56.350 
really a new part wig as much as a full

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:59.639 
really a new part wig as much as a full
wig<00:00:56.589> and<00:00:57.100> then<00:00:57.760> I<00:00:57.820> also<00:00:58.320> colored<00:00:59.320> the<00:00:59.440> hair<00:00:59.620> I

00:00:59.639 --> 00:00:59.649 
wig and then I also colored the hair I

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:01.290 
wig and then I also colored the hair I
have<00:00:59.920> a<00:00:59.949> video<00:01:00.190> on<00:01:00.309> how<00:01:00.429> to<00:01:00.460> color<00:01:00.789> my

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:01.300 
have a video on how to color my

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:04.619 
have a video on how to color my
extensions<00:01:01.839> I<00:01:02.079> just<00:01:03.010> bleached<00:01:03.399> it<00:01:03.699> and<00:01:04.059> then<00:01:04.600> I

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:04.629 
extensions I just bleached it and then I

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:09.540 
extensions I just bleached it and then I
added<00:01:04.900> a<00:01:05.530> toner<00:01:06.570> which<00:01:07.570> was<00:01:07.840> pale<00:01:08.620> ash<00:01:09.100> blonde

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:09.550 
added a toner which was pale ash blonde

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:13.350 
added a toner which was pale ash blonde
and<00:01:09.909> then<00:01:10.330> I<00:01:10.360> added<00:01:10.600> a<00:01:10.960> a<00:01:11.500> sh<00:01:11.530> color<00:01:12.520> on<00:01:12.939> top<00:01:13.180> of

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:13.360 
and then I added a a sh color on top of

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.270 
and then I added a a sh color on top of
it<00:01:13.509> because<00:01:13.689> I<00:01:13.869> like<00:01:14.020> my<00:01:14.170> hair<00:01:14.320> to<00:01:14.409> be<00:01:14.439> a<00:01:14.740> she<00:01:14.799> I

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:15.280 
it because I like my hair to be a she I

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.060 
it because I like my hair to be a she I
don't<00:01:15.460> like<00:01:15.640> the<00:01:15.850> brassy<00:01:16.570> red<00:01:16.960> sort<00:01:17.740> of<00:01:17.829> tones

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:18.070 
don't like the brassy red sort of tones

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:20.700 
don't like the brassy red sort of tones
so<00:01:18.610> I<00:01:18.640> think<00:01:19.090> this<00:01:19.210> color<00:01:19.390> came<00:01:19.810> out<00:01:19.960> perfect

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:20.710 
so I think this color came out perfect

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:22.859 
so I think this color came out perfect
now<00:01:21.340> I<00:01:21.369> left<00:01:21.610> a<00:01:21.759> little<00:01:21.939> bit<00:01:22.149> of<00:01:22.240> my<00:01:22.360> perimeter

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:22.869 
now I left a little bit of my perimeter

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:26.010 
now I left a little bit of my perimeter
out<00:01:23.049> just<00:01:23.530> so<00:01:23.799> that<00:01:24.250> I<00:01:24.280> can<00:01:24.670> pull<00:01:25.060> the<00:01:25.420> wig<00:01:25.869> a

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:26.020 
out just so that I can pull the wig a

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:27.660 
out just so that I can pull the wig a
little<00:01:26.049> bit<00:01:26.409> farther<00:01:26.710> back<00:01:26.829> instead<00:01:27.579> of

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.670 
little bit farther back instead of

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:29.069 
little bit farther back instead of
having<00:01:27.850> it<00:01:28.030> directly<00:01:28.420> at<00:01:28.509> my<00:01:28.600> hairline<00:01:28.930> and

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:31.090

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:33.670 
effects but other than that those are

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:35.880 
effects but other than that those are
the<00:01:33.820> specs<00:01:34.090> of<00:01:34.240> the<00:01:34.360> hair<00:01:34.570> so<00:01:35.049> let's<00:01:35.560> talk

damage<00:01:56.890> to<00:01:57.130> my<00:01:57.250> hair<00:01:57.460> so<00:01:58.000> it<00:01:58.090> makes<00:01:58.329> it<00:01:58.509> the

00:01:58.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
damage to my hair so it makes it the

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.219 
damage to my hair so it makes it the
ultimate<00:01:59.430> protective<00:02:00.430> styling<00:02:01.079> which<00:02:02.079> is

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:02.229 
ultimate protective styling which is

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:04.889 
ultimate protective styling which is
perfect<00:02:02.590> for<00:02:02.619> me<00:02:02.740> cuz<00:02:02.979> I'm<00:02:03.100> not<00:02:03.359> into<00:02:04.359> sort<00:02:04.810> of

00:02:04.889 --> 00:02:04.899 
perfect for me cuz I'm not into sort of

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:07.139 
perfect for me cuz I'm not into sort of
the<00:02:05.200> mini<00:02:05.619> twists<00:02:06.250> and<00:02:06.460> and<00:02:06.700> things<00:02:06.939> like<00:02:07.090> that

00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:07.149 
the mini twists and and things like that

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:09.060 
the mini twists and and things like that
like<00:02:07.359> I<00:02:07.840> like<00:02:08.110> to<00:02:08.229> keep<00:02:08.350> my<00:02:08.470> hair<00:02:08.560> protected

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:09.070 
like I like to keep my hair protected

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:11.370 
like I like to keep my hair protected
but<00:02:09.369> I<00:02:09.670> also<00:02:10.030> like<00:02:10.270> to<00:02:10.300> keep<00:02:10.420> it<00:02:10.690> free-flowing

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
but I also like to keep it free-flowing

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:13.550 
but I also like to keep it free-flowing
so<00:02:11.890> this<00:02:12.130> is<00:02:12.250> like<00:02:12.430> the<00:02:12.550> best<00:02:12.760> of<00:02:12.970> both<00:02:13.180> worlds

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 
so this is like the best of both worlds

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:17.940 
so this is like the best of both worlds
basically<00:02:14.640> this<00:02:15.640> is<00:02:15.880> Brazilian<00:02:16.630> wavy<00:02:16.930> hair<00:02:17.410> so

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
basically this is Brazilian wavy hair so

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.660 
basically this is Brazilian wavy hair so
as<00:02:18.220> you<00:02:18.370> can<00:02:18.490> see<00:02:18.550> this<00:02:18.880> is<00:02:19.060> the<00:02:19.240> natural<00:02:19.870> curl

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
as you can see this is the natural curl

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:30.380 
as you can see this is the natural curl
of<00:02:20.910> the<00:02:21.090> hair<00:02:21.300> so<00:02:21.900> it's<00:02:22.050> a<00:02:22.110> full<00:02:22.440> rotation<00:02:29.390> now

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:30.390 
of the hair so it's a full rotation now

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.050 
of the hair so it's a full rotation now
as<00:02:30.540> always<00:02:30.750> the<00:02:30.900> hair<00:02:31.230> texture<00:02:31.709> and<00:02:31.920> the<00:02:32.819> curl

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
as always the hair texture and the curl

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.780 
as always the hair texture and the curl
pattern<00:02:33.510> will<00:02:33.959> change<00:02:34.709> based<00:02:35.489> on<00:02:35.730> the

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:35.790 
pattern will change based on the

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:38.449 
pattern will change based on the
bleaching<00:02:36.180> that<00:02:36.360> I<00:02:36.510> did<00:02:36.750> but<00:02:37.319> it<00:02:37.530> is<00:02:37.739> very<00:02:38.190> very

00:02:38.449 --> 00:02:38.459 
bleaching that I did but it is very very

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:40.610 
bleaching that I did but it is very very
similar<00:02:38.850> to<00:02:39.000> how<00:02:39.510> I<00:02:39.540> received<00:02:40.080> it<00:02:40.290> it's<00:02:40.500> a

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:40.620 
similar to how I received it it's a

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:42.890 
similar to how I received it it's a
little<00:02:40.830> bit<00:02:40.950> looser<00:02:41.459> but<00:02:42.390> that's<00:02:42.600> to<00:02:42.810> be

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
little bit looser but that's to be

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.320 
little bit looser but that's to be
expected<00:02:43.069> now<00:02:44.069> because<00:02:44.580> I<00:02:44.700> bleached<00:02:44.970> the<00:02:45.120> hair

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:45.330 
expected now because I bleached the hair

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.400 
expected now because I bleached the hair
the<00:02:45.870> texture<00:02:46.170> to<00:02:46.350> change<00:02:46.620> slightly<00:02:47.130> and

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410 
the texture to change slightly and

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.720 
the texture to change slightly and
because<00:02:49.410> of<00:02:49.560> that<00:02:49.680> I<00:02:49.739> have<00:02:50.040> to<00:02:50.160> keep<00:02:50.310> it<00:02:50.489> more

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
because of that I have to keep it more

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.759 
because of that I have to keep it more
moisturized<00:02:51.269> more<00:02:51.510> often<00:02:51.840> when<00:02:52.349> I<00:02:52.380> receive

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
moisturized more often when I receive

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:56.390 
moisturized more often when I receive
the<00:02:52.890> hair<00:02:53.040> in<00:02:53.130> the<00:02:53.220> package<00:02:53.700> it<00:02:54.030> was<00:02:54.690> so<00:02:55.500> shiny

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:56.400 
the hair in the package it was so shiny

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:01.370 
the hair in the package it was so shiny
and<00:02:56.880> soft<00:02:57.569> and<00:02:58.340> beautiful<00:02:59.340> and<00:03:00.260> it's<00:03:01.260> not

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:01.380 
and soft and beautiful and it's not

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:02.690 
and soft and beautiful and it's not
going<00:03:01.500> to<00:03:01.590> say<00:03:01.739> that<00:03:01.920> this<00:03:02.010> hair<00:03:02.250> still<00:03:02.519> isn't

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:02.700 
going to say that this hair still isn't

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.300 
going to say that this hair still isn't
shiny<00:03:03.150> and<00:03:03.390> soft<00:03:03.750> but<00:03:04.380> I<00:03:04.620> just<00:03:04.860> have<00:03:05.010> to<00:03:05.160> add<00:03:05.280> a

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
shiny and soft but I just have to add a

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.470 
shiny and soft but I just have to add a
little<00:03:05.610> bit<00:03:05.850> of<00:03:05.910> extra<00:03:06.209> effort<00:03:06.450> and<00:03:08.360> you<00:03:09.360> know

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
little bit of extra effort and you know

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.809 
little bit of extra effort and you know
products<00:03:10.470> to<00:03:10.680> make<00:03:10.860> sure<00:03:11.069> that<00:03:11.250> it<00:03:11.400> stays<00:03:11.790> that

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:11.819 
products to make sure that it stays that

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:12.530 
products to make sure that it stays that
way

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
way

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:16.340 
way
but<00:03:13.019> it's<00:03:13.230> not<00:03:13.410> anything<00:03:13.890> super<00:03:14.610> and<00:03:15.569> you<00:03:16.230> know

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
but it's not anything super and you know

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:20.059 
but it's not anything super and you know
intense<00:03:16.860> I<00:03:17.519> just<00:03:18.120> add<00:03:18.330> my<00:03:18.870> confident<00:03:19.739> curls

00:03:20.059 --> 00:03:20.069 
intense I just add my confident curls

00:03:20.069 --> 00:03:22.520 
intense I just add my confident curls
from<00:03:20.340> Jessie<00:03:20.670> curl<00:03:20.880> and<00:03:21.180> I<00:03:21.810> add<00:03:22.049> the<00:03:22.290> forever

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:22.530 
from Jessie curl and I add the forever

shine conditioner from the Philip V and

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.080 
shine conditioner from the Philip V and
those<00:03:25.320> two<00:03:25.560> together<00:03:25.650> work<00:03:26.160> very<00:03:26.549> very<00:03:26.820> well

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
those two together work very very well

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:29.180 
those two together work very very well
to<00:03:27.390> maintain<00:03:27.810> this<00:03:28.079> natural<00:03:28.620> curl<00:03:28.829> pattern

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
to maintain this natural curl pattern

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.300 
to maintain this natural curl pattern
like<00:03:29.370> while<00:03:29.730> keeping<00:03:30.060> it<00:03:30.209> moisturized<00:03:31.310> from

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
like while keeping it moisturized from

like while keeping it moisturized from
being<00:03:32.549> bleached<00:03:33.560> now<00:03:34.560> let's<00:03:35.040> talk<00:03:35.190> about

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
being bleached now let's talk about

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:38.090 
being bleached now let's talk about
tangling<00:03:36.239> I<00:03:36.450> haven't<00:03:37.079> had<00:03:37.200> any<00:03:37.350> tangling<00:03:37.920> with

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
tangling I haven't had any tangling with

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:39.949 
tangling I haven't had any tangling with
the<00:03:38.160> hair<00:03:38.489> my<00:03:39.090> fingers<00:03:39.480> just<00:03:39.690> glide<00:03:39.930> right

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
the hair my fingers just glide right

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:41.870 
the hair my fingers just glide right
through<00:03:40.200> it<00:03:40.560> because<00:03:40.859> it<00:03:40.980> is<00:03:41.070> a<00:03:41.100> looser<00:03:41.640> curl

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
through it because it is a looser curl

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:44.300 
through it because it is a looser curl
pattern<00:03:42.269> so<00:03:42.570> I<00:03:42.840> don't<00:03:43.560> really<00:03:43.680> have<00:03:43.980> any<00:03:44.220> of

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:44.310 
pattern so I don't really have any of

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.400 
pattern so I don't really have any of
those<00:03:44.489> issues<00:03:45.209> and<00:03:45.570> wearing<00:03:45.989> the<00:03:46.079> hair<00:03:46.230> for

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:46.410 
those issues and wearing the hair for

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.490 
those issues and wearing the hair for
about<00:03:46.560> a<00:03:46.590> week<00:03:46.829> and<00:03:47.010> a<00:03:47.100> half<00:03:47.130> and<00:03:48.500> that's

00:03:49.490 --> 00:03:49.500 
about a week and a half and that's

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:52.130 
about a week and a half and that's
giving<00:03:50.160> me<00:03:50.250> enough<00:03:50.549> time<00:03:50.910> to<00:03:50.940> sort<00:03:51.480> of<00:03:51.630> realize

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 
giving me enough time to sort of realize

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.550 
giving me enough time to sort of realize
how<00:03:52.890> the<00:03:52.950> hair<00:03:53.340> is<00:03:53.640> wear<00:03:54.000> and<00:03:54.180> tear

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 
how the hair is wear and tear

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.259 
how the hair is wear and tear
maintenance<00:03:55.560> and<00:03:56.100> that<00:03:56.190> sort<00:03:56.489> of<00:03:56.519> thing<00:03:56.730> so<00:03:57.030> my

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:57.269 
maintenance and that sort of thing so my

00:03:57.269 --> 00:03:59.000 
maintenance and that sort of thing so my
fingers<00:03:57.450> just<00:03:57.630> glide<00:03:57.959> right<00:03:58.200> through<00:03:58.650> it<00:03:58.769> no

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
fingers just glide right through it no

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:02.180 
fingers just glide right through it no
issues<00:03:59.370> at<00:03:59.400> all<00:03:59.670> and<00:04:00.530> when<00:04:01.530> it<00:04:01.650> comes<00:04:01.890> to

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
issues at all and when it comes to
