00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:11.630
 6 

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:13.390
 if you keep looking at me like that, it's 

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:18.690
 shameful 

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:18.690
 Do not worry I'll take care of you 

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:24.599
 live alive awake 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.039
 what if 

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:32.980
 you're making me lose patience 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:47.180
 You really get me mad 

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:49.370
 Sometimes I did not have to exaggerate 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.710
 we can take it is better to share 

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.090
 with you an apartment does not give you the right 

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:56.050
 to disrespect me 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:01:00.140
 hey you never lack respect as 

00:00:56.050 --> 00:01:03.339
 by the way today I was surrounding more than 

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:08.750
 normal you can see that he was dreaming 

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:12.530
 I am yes I was dreaming of food 

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:14.780

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:17.960
 that also be with me we are not friends 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:20.330
 Friendship and respect are balanced and 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:23.810
 what is coming for sure was dreaming 

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:26.479
 dirty things and that I was not dreaming 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:29.710
 sure I was dreaming back with those 

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:29.710
 Rare girls from your comics 

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:37.190
 I will take your silence as a set you are a 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:42.140

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:45.400

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:45.400
 that be so cold with me 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.100
 not seriously because it has to be cold 

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:53.100

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:58.479
 this is for you thanks for coming to 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:01.690
 despite what happened 

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:03.640
 well it's not like we can leave like this 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:07.130
 easy 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:09.950
 they covered the hair gel ten days with sun 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:12.380
 well the truth has not been a great 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:14.480
 dilemma come home like that but 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:18.830
 we must handle it well to go to his 

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:20.900
 good dimension yes but if we are not in 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:24.019
 chronicle 2 to perfection is not possible 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.750
 to me to return with her although she yes 

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:30.760
 may return alone 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:30.760
 he says because he does not come back good 

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:41.360
 I control you 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:41.360
 i 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:51.470
 and what 

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:55.250
 still does not know how to handle it 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:57.380
 perfection not but if you want to go back to 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:02.590
 you alone are already needing you 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:07.250
 now it's not right I'll stay with you and 

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:11.140
 you worry about me it 's obvious that if the 

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:11.140
 truth is that you're pretty useless 

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:17.630
 because with me shit 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:22.920
 today I see 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:25.830
 but I do not see that that's what you 

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:28.350
 worry is not really the big deal 

00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:30.660
 is that lately I feel more useless 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:36.390
 and I feel that I am being a burden to 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:37.830
 she that's all good that and the truth 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:41.370
 is that I can not understand why she 

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:44.010
 this broad community is a serious friend 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:46.620
 where have you been all this time 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:49.730
 even I know that she is not from time 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.730
 who like to work as a team 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:55.330
 let's defeat sets and toys 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:59.800
 good 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:02.610
 it's hard to make friends but it's going 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:05.950
 improving little by little 

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:08.260
 I see but it is not as if for the 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:12.510
 night out outside shy attractive 

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:12.510
 and tender as you never imagine 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:24.570
 shit that would be too much but not that 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:24.570
 I would be able to stand it 

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:30.820
 You feel wind and are getting along 

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:32.470
 well we managed to stay in a 

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:36.360
 apartment for now and we have not had 

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:36.360
 so many problems is what you mean 

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:41.780
 you look so cute that you start living with 

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.780
 a true couple 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:48.849
 what good 

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:48.849
 not what you said 

00:04:49.069 --> 00:04:53.590
 I do not understand, wait, but they are not boyfriends 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:05:01.460
 of course it is not very obvious that 

00:04:58.849 --> 00:05:05.630
 they are not a couple is really 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:10.280
 easy to notice it just by looking at them 

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:11.960
 seriously obviously not also never 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:14.810
 I had even thought about interacting with 

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:17.240
 him in that way 

00:05:14.810 --> 00:05:21.230
 well it's not like someone also gets 

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:23.000
 could interest in showcase and yes I think 

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:25.730
 that that would be something that I do not 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.690
 I got used to know you can do it 

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:28.690
 be signed to mind 

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:35.730
 Fuck that this guy is weird to what 

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:39.310
 you mean what you just said 

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:41.770
 good you can dress that despite being 

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:46.030
 a princess by birth you're not from 

00:05:41.770 --> 00:05:48.550
 everything that we say feminine and you think that 

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:50.920
 that's something important to me I just 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:52.630
 I fulfill my duties and I believe that 

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:55.600
 you could also say that your 

00:05:52.630 --> 00:06:00.940
 attitudes are somewhat masculine how they 

00:05:55.600 --> 00:06:04.210
 define and was perhaps male is that as 

00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:09.050
 I called just said what I just 

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:11.620
 see that and without mentioning your flat chest 

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:11.620
 do not 

00:06:11.969 --> 00:06:20.389
 what did you just say tell me to 

00:06:14.879 --> 00:06:24.569
 the face that you may be deaf or flat 

00:06:20.389 --> 00:06:27.739
 girls see it that way I think it would be 

00:06:24.569 --> 00:06:30.629
 what I could not stand 

00:06:27.739 --> 00:06:33.079
 james brother a soothing you with 

00:06:30.629 --> 00:06:33.079
 during 

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:39.550
 because we do not see cleaning if it 's 

00:06:37.479 --> 00:06:42.750
 well after all that is the only 

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:42.750
 why I'm here
