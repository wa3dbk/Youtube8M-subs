 explain how to prepare the horse 

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:12.650
 we can do it in various ways 

00:00:10.090 --> 00:00:15.230
 we can put a block and 

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:17.300

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:20.449
 first the saddle and leave the flanges and 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:22.699
 I can only endure it with my lives or if I do not 

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:24.529

00:00:22.699 --> 00:00:26.720
 head first take the lives 

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:28.490
 because the nap will tie it to the post and 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.130
 then remove the frame with more 

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:31.929
 calm in agreement 

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:33.489
 Now let's do the first thing 

00:00:31.929 --> 00:00:37.600
 first we will start taking the lives 

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:39.370
 that we will remember everything that has not 

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:40.720
 we will endure here we always have 

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:43.000
 to leave lives and in the neck to 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:46.269
 have a point of grip and we have to 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.559
 remove the flanges we take care 

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:49.990
 here in the mouth the iron that is with 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:52.210
 care and then 

00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:55.870
 we are going to put the nod to them 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:58.500
 to be able to take it we put carefully by 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:58.500
 behind the ears 

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:03.130
 and adam you roll 

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:06.670
 we are the horse now we can take it 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:09.360
 we take this out of the flanges and now what 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:09.360
 we tie the pole 

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:14.240
 We already had the rope removed from before 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:16.440
 Thus 

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.750
 and now we can continue working on 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:22.220
 horse removing the saddle 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.810
 now let's take out the saddle 

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:25.610
 to remove the saddle is very simple 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.890
 we just have to take everything out to 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.630
 to be able to remove the frame at the top 

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:31.010
 important are the stirrups is always 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:32.450
 better pick them up before taking out the 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:34.790
 saddle if we can not hit him 

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:38.360
 to the horse with them I jump from this 

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:39.760
 I pick up the step I pass it by 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.290

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.690
 fixed and when removing the frame does not 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:58.110
 hit anywhere we take the cinch 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:59.659
