 Todd Stitzer 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:20.589
 the small Croatian or pesto open gives increased close to the 

00:00:20.589 --> 00:00:22.560
 Northern tip of the island of Pag 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:25.730
 Witten in the Northeim clinical Adriatic 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:30.020
 and even 90 minutes from Saïda International Airport 

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:33.020
 away 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:41.230
 no more than pure alliance at the beginning of the eighties over Partizan 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:43.780
 that is different today 

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:47.520
 Initially used only as a weekend home for a few contacts 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.520
 he lived the small village from the mid-eighties, a large influx 

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:55.989
 next to pretty single-family homes 

00:00:55.989 --> 00:00:58.859
 can be found here partially very exclusive or force 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:01.859
 with direct sea view 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:11.490
 over the years it was taken care of 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.770
 the fortified paths and access to the previously difficult to reach fur 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.770
 Beach were built 

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:23.100
 til today 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.829
 The originally broken type could be largely preserved 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.050
 Although hundreds of people spend their holidays here every year 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:32.540
 but it is and remains 

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.590
 managed one of the secluded place 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.590
 the fifth largest island of the Council 

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.110
 even the Serbian Croat in the war in the nineties does not have it 

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:45.530
 leave traces 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.470
 even if the then front line directly at the only 30 kilometers 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.470
 distant Paderborn can be traversed 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:02.060
 The Banovic offshore on the mainland swirled 

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.000
 is often responsible for the consistently good climate and the many 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.580
 Sunshine hours on the island 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.890
 Lord, the clouds simply hang on the high mountains 

00:02:14.649 --> 00:02:21.430
 constant companions are sometimes very hot summer months 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:26.660
 Felix Ekardt here on the locals a child rather not the whole day 

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.660
 has been raining 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.910
 t 

00:02:39.489 --> 00:02:43.879
 want to ride and rosemary shrubs are also part of the typical image of 

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:44.719
 place 

00:02:44.719 --> 00:02:47.489
 like the picturesque village center 

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:50.639
 Here is a small family-run screening 

00:02:50.639 --> 00:02:52.069
 that with her terrace 

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:55.949
 the small bay of the simple rows invites you to linger 

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:04.739
 the oldest house on the market 

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:07.539
 that temporarily served as a grocery store 

00:03:07.539 --> 00:03:10.539
 is back today 

00:03:13.329 --> 00:03:17.719
 but the special thing about this is making Supporters a little holiday paradise 

00:03:17.719 --> 00:03:19.169
 Ocean 

00:03:19.169 --> 00:03:21.609
 while the big ones relax 

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:24.609
 The little water rats enjoy unadulterated bathing fun 

00:03:27.899 --> 00:03:30.899
 Aachen 

00:03:34.749 --> 00:03:37.949
 Vienna 

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:40.949
 on 

00:03:47.759 --> 00:03:50.759
 ca 

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:55.049
 on 

00:03:57.549 --> 00:03:58.999
 ca 

00:03:58.999 --> 00:04:00.259
 No 

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:03.259
 b 

00:04:07.499 --> 00:04:11.609
 one of the first contact he built his house and made himself domestic 

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:13.989
 has settled down is now has 

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:15.799
 80 years old 

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:19.299
 he has spent almost 30 years early summer 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:22.299
 and autumn in this little place 

00:04:24.289 --> 00:04:28.870
 until 20 relentless locks are the right air I dissolved 

00:04:28.869 --> 00:04:32.219
 even beautiful beach means 

00:04:32.219 --> 00:04:37.399
 and very good people live here mostly that's just we can grieve Oliver 

00:04:37.399 --> 00:04:43.300
 Cruiser 18 and the people of which two weeks a year or four weeks 

00:04:43.299 --> 00:04:49.169
 technically spend about half a year thought Wozniak is particularly visible 

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:54.309
 is that I do not love that readers reflect disclaimer maybe fits 

00:04:54.309 --> 00:04:57.729
 do not construct a contrast »makes the bay 

00:04:57.729 --> 00:05:04.550
 here is mostly nice weather not good food not lead to peace 

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:07.550
 calmed down 

00:05:17.559 --> 00:05:19.120
 there is 

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.849
 means as much as forget-me-not 

00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:25.229
 Anyway, spend some time here in the Mediterranean climate of the northernmost 

00:05:25.229 --> 00:05:27.999
 Zipfel is then spent Marzehns 

00:05:27.999 --> 00:05:29.650
 the game park has carvers 

00:05:29.650 --> 00:05:30.710
 certainly not forgotten
