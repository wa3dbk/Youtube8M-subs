00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:15.809
 welcome to of gameplay in this 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:18.779
 occasion we are back in strain the 

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:21.840
 deep and I'll show you briefly how 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:24.509
 get purified water for that what 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.270
 they need is to first go to the others 

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:29.640
 islands either swimming or rafting and 

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:32.460
 check on the remains of the ships that 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.870
 there is in the area to be able to get 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:37.579
 this item a bucket of water 

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:39.739
 as you can see the bucket is 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:44.860
 empty then the only thing that you have to 

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:47.050
 to do is to immerse yourself a bit in the water and 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.340
 as you can see the bucket already brought water 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:50.380
 but no 

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.550
 until enough although there is 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:55.370
 totally 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:56.930
 totally full and what we are going to do 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:00.050
 let's get to the field that we have 

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:02.590
 on and with left click the 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:02.590
 we place 

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:09.210
 in this way 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.210
 will begin to purify 

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.280
 Water 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.380
 Now let's get a little more 

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:17.010
 apparently we already have it here in 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:21.060
 the island 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:25.380
 a rock then we will have to go to 

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:29.100
 to another island to bring more more firewood 

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:31.289
 put the campaign and the consumption enough and 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.790
 there is no way to regulate the 

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:34.710
 still 

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:37.540
 what you can do is add little 

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:40.830
 to little as you go needing 

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:40.830
 because if you leave all 

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:53.080
 the water is completely served 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:56.520
 while we take another look here in the 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:58.090
 island to see if there is not some new 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.409
 much 

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.770
 in the spaces to take us 

00:01:59.409 --> 00:02:01.770
 few 

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:10.280
 let's put them in our warehouse 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.280
 makeshift 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:17.120
 the spices in which there 

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:21.530
 Excellent 

00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:26.920
 and let's leave the bet small rock 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.920
 by 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:37.360
 as you can see when they come out no no 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.360
 ends 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:43.720
 this is a lot of the water that we collect 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:47.180
 the more water we collect the more time 

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:50.269
 it takes to boil completely 

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:52.720
 remember the field when it ends 

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:56.319
 cook some 

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:58.959
 some crab or meat 

00:02:56.319 --> 00:03:01.629
 a chime sounds like an oven 

00:02:58.959 --> 00:03:05.499
 microwave in the case of water at 

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:07.940
 it seems to simply boil it but not 

00:03:05.499 --> 00:03:09.620
 it sounds 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:12.830
 that the water is ready then 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:15.400
 let's click and see if the 

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:15.400
 we can drink 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:21.880
 they saw as less water is let 

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.880
 give him another drink 

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:31.430
 and we're finished in the water 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.920
 and to refill it in the same way 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:35.900
 you know they get 

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:40.390
 it becomes the water it becomes 

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:42.690
 fill the bucket and place it in the field 

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:45.670
 this why then so that it be purified 

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:48.780
 and keep our states 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:51.270
 100% 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:55.360
 I hope it has been of your help to this 

00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:57.940
 small tutorial if the video liked it 

00:03:55.360 --> 00:04:02.430
 give us a like and subscribe that 

00:03:57.940 --> 00:04:02.430
 have an excellent day until soon
