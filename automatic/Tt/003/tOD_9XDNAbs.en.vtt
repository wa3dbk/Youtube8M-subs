00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:05.730
 hello we will manufacture 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:09.870
 today an infant mask one draws 

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:15.269
 id for that we're going to need a 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:17.760
 egg yolk of a lemon of a spoon 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:20.689

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:24.859
 tablespoon of green clay 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:30.529
 so here I got the lemon juice 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:30.529

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.489

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.920
 thick paste 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:46.360
 once you get that texture 

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:50.380
 you can start spreading it out 

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:53.740

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:56.560

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.040
