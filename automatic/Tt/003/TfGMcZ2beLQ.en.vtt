which is a great thing some concern for

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.500 
which is a great thing some concern for
the<00:02:21.709> environment<00:02:22.310> and<00:02:22.489> we<00:02:23.090> definitely

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
the environment and we definitely

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.420

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
for that now it's a fairly compact box

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.240 
for that now it's a fairly compact box
you<00:02:29.209> see<00:02:29.420> it<00:02:29.540> to<00:02:29.720> us<00:02:29.870> that's<00:02:30.200> the<00:02:30.500> phone<00:02:30.860> the

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
you see it to us that's the phone the

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.479 
you see it to us that's the phone the
Samsung<00:02:31.640> Galaxy<00:02:31.790> mega<00:02:32.209> 5.8<00:02:32.600> duo<00:02:33.080> so<00:02:33.440> it<00:02:34.160> has

00:02:34.479 --> 00:02:34.489 
Samsung Galaxy mega 5.8 duo so it has

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:40.840 
Samsung Galaxy mega 5.8 duo so it has
dual<00:02:35.239> SIM<00:02:35.650> the<00:02:37.000> say<00:02:38.000> so<00:02:38.060> I<00:02:38.420> think<00:02:39.730> there's<00:02:40.730> some

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:40.850 
dual SIM the say so I think there's some

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:43.690 
dual SIM the say so I think there's some
information<00:02:41.300> there<00:02:42.019> you<00:02:42.080> see<00:02:42.230> the<00:02:42.350> MRP<00:02:42.700> 2500

quick info there yeah
and<00:02:55.910> both<00:02:56.239> the<00:02:56.360> parts<00:02:56.690> are<00:02:56.840> stuck<00:02:57.079> down<00:02:57.110> this

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:57.820 
and both the parts are stuck down this

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:03.130 
and both the parts are stuck down this
monster<00:02:58.820> that<00:02:59.360> you<00:02:59.480> can<00:02:59.660> probably<00:03:01.329> cut<00:03:02.329> it<00:03:02.450> by

no surprises not that we expected any so

00:04:22.669 --> 00:04:27.430 
no surprises not that we expected any so
that's<00:04:22.880> the<00:04:23.539> Galaxy<00:04:24.020> mega<00:04:24.289> 5.8<00:04:26.020> let's<00:04:27.020> go<00:04:27.289> and

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:27.440 
that's the Galaxy mega 5.8 let's go and

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:34.589 
that's the Galaxy mega 5.8 let's go and
strip<00:04:27.919> it<00:04:28.130> off<00:04:28.340> the<00:04:28.910> unnecessary<00:04:29.330> plastic

00:04:34.589 --> 00:04:34.599 

00:04:34.599 --> 00:04:35.830 

yeah

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:35.840 
yeah

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:37.960 
yeah
so<00:04:36.740> there<00:04:36.889> you<00:04:36.919> say<00:04:37.099> that<00:04:37.280> although<00:04:37.460> it<00:04:37.699> looks

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:37.970 
so there you say that although it looks

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:40.719 
so there you say that although it looks
very<00:04:38.599> similar<00:04:38.900> to<00:04:39.440> the<00:04:39.560> galaxy<00:04:40.070> and<00:04:40.280> grand

00:04:40.719 --> 00:04:40.729 
very similar to the galaxy and grand

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:46.589 
very similar to the galaxy and grand
tours<00:04:42.460> very<00:04:43.460> lightweight<00:04:44.050> again<00:04:45.050> very<00:04:45.349> usual

00:04:46.589 --> 00:04:46.599 
tours very lightweight again very usual

00:04:46.599 --> 00:04:48.879 
tours very lightweight again very usual
familiar<00:04:47.599> material<00:04:48.020> that<00:04:48.229> all<00:04:48.470> Samsung

00:04:48.879 --> 00:04:48.889 
familiar material that all Samsung

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:52.420 
familiar material that all Samsung
Galaxy<00:04:49.460> devices<00:04:49.610> are<00:04:49.970> made<00:04:50.180> of<00:04:50.800> not<00:04:51.800> very<00:04:52.130> thin

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:52.430 
Galaxy devices are made of not very thin

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:59.860 
Galaxy devices are made of not very thin
but<00:04:52.789> fits<00:04:53.780> nicely<00:04:56.349> my<00:04:57.349> strong<00:04:57.830> metals<00:04:58.870> like

00:04:59.860 --> 00:04:59.870 
but fits nicely my strong metals like

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:03.930 
but fits nicely my strong metals like
metal<00:05:00.740> like<00:05:00.949> ring<00:05:01.479> but<00:05:02.479> I<00:05:02.539> am<00:05:02.599> sure<00:05:02.840> that's

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:03.940 
metal like ring but I am sure that's

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:06.370 
metal like ring but I am sure that's
high-quality<00:05:04.940> polycarbonate<00:05:05.840> so<00:05:06.050> we'll<00:05:06.169> come

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:06.380 
high-quality polycarbonate so we'll come

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:09.189 
high-quality polycarbonate so we'll come
back<00:05:06.560> to<00:05:06.710> the<00:05:06.860> hardware<00:05:07.669> later<00:05:07.930> you<00:05:08.930> have<00:05:09.050> some

00:05:09.189 --> 00:05:09.199 
back to the hardware later you have some

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:13.779 
back to the hardware later you have some
textures<00:05:09.710> here<00:05:10.010> on<00:05:10.699> the<00:05:10.849> back<00:05:12.039> yeah<00:05:13.039> so<00:05:13.610> that's

00:05:13.779 --> 00:05:13.789 
textures here on the back yeah so that's

00:05:13.789 --> 00:05:17.469 
textures here on the back yeah so that's
the<00:05:14.210> galaxy<00:05:14.630> mega<00:05:14.810> 5.8<00:05:15.820> we'll<00:05:16.820> be<00:05:16.909> back<00:05:17.150> with

00:05:17.469 --> 00:05:17.479 
the galaxy mega 5.8 we'll be back with

00:05:17.479 --> 00:05:25.770 
the galaxy mega 5.8 we'll be back with
the<00:05:17.599> hardware

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:25.780 

00:05:25.780 --> 00:05:27.840 

you
