 river 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.369
 to go later because with unemployment 

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:31.539
 I have doubled what videogames want 

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:34.539
 It seems that they want to build prof 

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.280
 I do not know that it always happens 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:40.000
 despite this remains the same 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.640
 a true masterpiece that costs 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:46.010
 since then the period of weakness 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.150
 for its part 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:51.150
 that sense ride the blood engine 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.640
 there is a lot of play that both this type of entertainment while he painted the 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.830
 walls with a nice red color 

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:04.440
 has to keep being remembered for the amount of good times and a half 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:05.730
 that game is 

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:07.550
 who is 

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.430
 one 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.820
 do not shoot third parties for after 63 days 

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:17.340
 and the assumption that one of the best generation conditions 

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.720
 I think the most important thing is sure 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:20.960
 for the expert 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.370
 so without further delay 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:25.290
 let's analyze the fat 

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.600
 one of the first things that a person does not so much their body 

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.190
 the expert did the one that has 

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:33.510
 during his departure the game showed one of the best graphics in videogames 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:34.310
 Until now 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:36.080
 and still in a wonder to admire 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.410
 we never control the whole process of pipeline came flying through the air 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.300
 oysters 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.510
 the incident was reported by efe and that's because it's exceptional 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:48.710
 with what many will say that this port the destination is ideal for children 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:49.920
 little ones 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.810
 although oddly enough there is an option that allows you to eliminate part of 

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:55.040
 the violence of the game 

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.660
 the only thing that is the reality of removing the blood of the enemies so the bottom 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:01.490
 he shoots them just out of sparks 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:02.930
 waxed roofing 

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:06.950
 the detail the textures the lighting effects and artistic design of 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.109
 game is spectacular and it varies drastically mexico advances 

00:02:11.109 --> 00:02:14.419
 although I do have a complaint 

00:02:14.419 --> 00:02:18.989
 the colors is not that they are but nothing like that that's what it is 

00:02:20.179 --> 00:02:21.859
 there is no that without 

00:02:21.859 --> 00:02:26.329
 ikusi game to remove to have more than one main screen color at the same time 

00:02:26.929 --> 00:02:28.469
 fuci the south 

00:02:28.469 --> 00:02:29.839
 crisis 

00:02:29.839 --> 00:02:32.019
 the names of football 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:35.019
 It is not good 1 

00:02:35.869 --> 00:02:38.869
 Red 

00:02:39.469 --> 00:02:41.389
 Hostal 

00:02:41.389 --> 00:02:43.399
 efe 

00:02:43.399 --> 00:02:46.399
 do not sneak 

00:02:46.969 --> 00:02:49.969
 min 

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:52.459
 for example 

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:55.459
 by its structure by branches is 

00:02:56.589 --> 00:02:59.589
 that 

00:03:01.229 --> 00:03:03.649
 It's not fair 3 

00:03:03.649 --> 00:03:06.649
 this video is dedicated the ball 

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:17.629
 you can go to more 

00:03:17.629 --> 00:03:21.159
 another thing that you can notice in the plasterboard graphics this principle 

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:25.449
 of each level the young man and that makes a little charged of textures except a pair of 

00:03:25.449 --> 00:03:28.719
 second and actually almost not even notice when it happens 

00:03:28.719 --> 00:03:33.599
 but far from what I have caused here is a beautiful game that from time to time 

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:37.219
 when it becomes 0 imagine what that day is like in real life 

00:03:37.749 --> 00:03:39.719
 cute 

00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:41.679
 cute 

00:03:41.679 --> 00:03:42.779
 cute 

00:03:42.779 --> 00:03:45.779
 pedro gándará 

00:03:46.869 --> 00:03:49.869
 he 

00:03:50.369 --> 00:03:53.789
 every day 

00:03:53.789 --> 00:03:55.119
 for now 

00:03:55.119 --> 00:03:58.119
 A) Yes 

00:04:04.669 --> 00:04:08.239
 thus it was established that the graphics continues its course and excellent 

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:09.859
 also in history 

00:04:09.859 --> 00:04:13.199
 good, unfortunately, as not doing a very good job in arrived at mestalla 

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:14.269
 to the front 

00:04:14.269 --> 00:04:15.550
 this can be noticed 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:18.550
 from the beginning in the introduction 

00:04:20.819 --> 00:04:22.229
 there are only two reasons 

00:04:22.229 --> 00:04:24.840
 fourteen years after the day 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.840
 buenos aires was the day d penn 

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:32.039
 the couple while south korea 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:34.330
 to go outside 

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:36.650
 this year 

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:39.650
 the work of the staff 

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.800
 when he knocked down the door it will come out in lip 

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:48.099
 I have no idea from here 

00:04:48.099 --> 00:04:49.099
 the context 

00:04:49.099 --> 00:04:52.349
 what face to face 

00:04:52.349 --> 00:04:55.450
 vieri who sounded to start 

00:04:55.450 --> 00:04:58.379
 but what are you doing yesterday at 13 

00:04:58.379 --> 00:04:59.180
 there it goes 

00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:01.229
 things change 

00:05:01.229 --> 00:05:03.690
 that was the problem of the left inside 

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:08.370
 explain to us what will be assigned and the thing that does explain to abc that is linked to 

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:10.210
 explains from readers 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:14.710
 that unless the leader the Paraguayan Edgar Benitez became interested 

00:05:15.509 --> 00:05:20.069
 If you want a slightly summarized version of the study of your work, you will 

00:05:20.069 --> 00:05:21.120
 more or less so 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:24.630
 for mejía the thick spots parking meter the monsters 

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:28.980
 eurostat as part of those debts we want joke and claims of those showed 

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:30.969
 ugly 

00:05:30.969 --> 00:05:33.969
 the outside the PSOE will ask in the full tc 

00:05:36.699 --> 00:05:40.610
 we are at the extraction point even though this is not memorable 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:41.810
 characters are 

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:45.080
 each one has a different personality that motivates you to keep playing just for 

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:46.999
 listen to what will be the next thing they say 

00:05:46.999 --> 00:05:50.430
 in dead plaster take the role of mockus 

00:05:50.430 --> 00:05:51.439
 so 

00:05:51.439 --> 00:05:54.479
 a soldier who has been imprisoned for having done 

00:05:54.479 --> 00:05:55.860
 aa 

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:57.249
 then 

00:05:57.249 --> 00:06:00.699
 released by his best friend dominic santiago telling him that he has been 

00:06:00.699 --> 00:06:03.740
 forgiven and they need your help 

00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:06.110
 that sounds logical not 

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:09.360
 I think the humor is and russia and the largest number of released frames 

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:12.439
 also the leaders resolved life 

00:06:12.439 --> 00:06:16.469
 the gurí wanted to stop blaming prison good now since October 

00:06:16.469 --> 00:06:21.399
 2001 the community doctor launcher so you think 

00:06:22.740 --> 00:06:24.719
 pl 

00:06:24.719 --> 00:06:27.799
 that's something that fascinates me liquidity happens despite having a story 

00:06:27.799 --> 00:06:29.800
 almost inexistent 

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:32.159
 one of the characters involved lawyers 

00:06:32.159 --> 00:06:34.119
 Kirchner you do not notice it 

00:06:34.119 --> 00:06:37.700
 someone who happened during the dialogues was about alcohol 

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:39.469
 every time it consolidates 

00:06:39.469 --> 00:06:43.369
 I did not know when I work that for some reason or a new record that happened 

00:06:43.369 --> 00:06:44.900
 in the last time I tried direct 

00:06:44.900 --> 00:06:45.830
 the important thing 

00:06:45.830 --> 00:06:48.050
 I never felt so bad been true 

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:51.050
 look 

00:06:54.110 --> 00:06:56.349
 imbecil 

00:06:56.349 --> 00:06:59.349
 the civil Guard 

00:07:00.629 --> 00:07:03.219
 leo messi youtube 

00:07:03.219 --> 00:07:04.319
