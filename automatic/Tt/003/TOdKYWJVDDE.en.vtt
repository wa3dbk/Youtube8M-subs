00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.030 
better just to sort of aim in the
direction<00:01:43.540> you<00:01:43.720> want<00:01:43.810> to<00:01:43.960> go<00:01:44.050> once<00:01:44.650> you<00:01:44.770> get<00:01:44.920> up

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:45.040 
direction you want to go once you get up

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:46.890 
direction you want to go once you get up
to<00:01:45.220> speed<00:01:45.490> you<00:01:45.700> can<00:01:45.880> sort<00:01:46.119> of<00:01:46.210> run<00:01:46.420> through<00:01:46.690> the

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:46.900 
to speed you can sort of run through the

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:49.440 
to speed you can sort of run through the
map<00:01:47.080> and<00:01:47.380> attack<00:01:48.070> Marines<00:01:48.460> and<00:01:48.670> stuff<00:01:48.880> if<00:01:49.150> you

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450 
map and attack Marines and stuff if you

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.140 
map and attack Marines and stuff if you
hold<00:01:49.660> down<00:01:49.720> shift<00:01:50.229> you<00:01:51.040> will<00:01:51.070> charge<00:01:51.610> this

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:52.150 
hold down shift you will charge this

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:53.820 
hold down shift you will charge this
makes<00:01:52.390> it<00:01:52.540> very<00:01:52.720> difficult<00:01:53.020> to<00:01:53.259> steer<00:01:53.560> left

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:53.830 
makes it very difficult to steer left

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:56.279 
makes it very difficult to steer left
and<00:01:54.009> right<00:01:54.130> you<00:01:54.160> basically<00:01:54.670> can't<00:01:55.000> but<00:01:55.720> if<00:01:56.140> you

00:01:56.279 --> 00:01:56.289 
and right you basically can't but if you

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:59.249 
and right you basically can't but if you
charge<00:01:56.590> in<00:01:56.950> two<00:01:57.160> people<00:01:57.280> you<00:01:57.970> will<00:01:58.300> gore<00:01:59.080> them

00:01:59.249 --> 00:01:59.259 
charge in two people you will gore them

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:00.680 
charge in two people you will gore them
I<00:01:59.440> believe<00:01:59.649> he'll<00:01:59.890> do<00:02:00.009> some<00:02:00.160> damage<00:02:00.430> and

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:00.690 
I believe he'll do some damage and

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:03.120 
I believe he'll do some damage and
that's<00:02:01.690> very<00:02:01.960> useful<00:02:02.020> for<00:02:02.259> charging<00:02:02.740> into<00:02:03.009> the

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:03.130 
that's very useful for charging into the

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:04.380 
that's very useful for charging into the
Marine<00:02:03.340> base<00:02:03.490> doing<00:02:03.820> some<00:02:03.940> damage<00:02:04.210> to<00:02:04.240> the

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:04.390 
Marine base doing some damage to the

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:08.279 
Marine base doing some damage to the
buildings<00:02:04.690> and<00:02:06.240> let's<00:02:07.240> see<00:02:07.450> you<00:02:07.600> can<00:02:07.720> jump<00:02:07.930> but

00:02:08.279 --> 00:02:08.289 
buildings and let's see you can jump but

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:09.690 
buildings and let's see you can jump but
that's<00:02:08.530> not<00:02:08.679> very<00:02:08.770> useful<00:02:08.890> you<00:02:09.160> can<00:02:09.429> Crouch

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
that's not very useful you can Crouch

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:12.180 
that's not very useful you can Crouch

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:46.210 
changes everything because they're just

00:04:46.210 --> 00:04:47.430 
changes everything because they're just
going<00:04:46.360> to<00:04:46.419> jet<00:04:46.690> away<00:04:46.960> from<00:04:47.169> you

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:47.440 
going to jet away from you

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.409 
going to jet away from you
so<00:04:47.740> to<00:04:47.830> fight<00:04:48.070> jet<00:04:48.340> pack<00:04:48.550> Marines<00:04:48.940> find<00:04:49.270> a

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:49.419 
so to fight jet pack Marines find a

00:04:49.419 --> 00:04:51.870 
so to fight jet pack Marines find a
small<00:04:49.720> and<00:04:49.990> closed<00:04:50.229> space<00:04:50.650> your<00:04:51.250> gore<00:04:51.550> range

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:51.880 
small and closed space your gore range

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:54.450 
small and closed space your gore range
is<00:04:52.240> not<00:04:52.539> like<00:04:52.990> you<00:04:53.620> don't<00:04:53.860> have<00:04:53.979> to<00:04:54.130> literally

00:04:54.450 --> 00:04:54.460 
is not like you don't have to literally

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:56.640 
is not like you don't have to literally
be<00:04:54.639> touching<00:04:55.120> them<00:04:55.270> you<00:04:55.960> can<00:04:56.110> go<00:04:56.259> or<00:04:56.350> someone

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:56.650 
be touching them you can go or someone

00:04:56.650 --> 00:04:59.820 
be touching them you can go or someone
I'm<00:04:56.949> sort<00:04:57.280> of<00:04:57.370> far<00:04:57.550> away<00:04:57.729> and<00:04:58.590> what<00:04:59.590> you<00:04:59.680> want

00:04:59.820 --> 00:04:59.830 
I'm sort of far away and what you want

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:01.260 
I'm sort of far away and what you want
to<00:04:59.919> do<00:05:00.039> is<00:05:00.280> lure<00:05:00.550> them<00:05:00.699> into<00:05:00.910> a<00:05:00.940> very<00:05:01.090> small

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:01.270 
to do is lure them into a very small

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:03.529 
to do is lure them into a very small
space<00:05:01.479> where<00:05:01.960> they<00:05:02.020> can't<00:05:02.199> jetpack<00:05:02.560> around

00:05:03.529 --> 00:05:03.539 
space where they can't jetpack around

00:05:03.539 --> 00:05:05.939 
space where they can't jetpack around
this<00:05:04.539> would<00:05:04.780> be<00:05:04.900> ideal<00:05:05.020> if<00:05:05.350> this<00:05:05.500> were<00:05:05.620> a<00:05:05.650> room

00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:05.949 
this would be ideal if this were a room

00:05:05.949 --> 00:05:07.980 
this would be ideal if this were a room
and<00:05:06.190> not<00:05:06.250> part<00:05:06.580> of<00:05:06.639> a<00:05:06.729> larger<00:05:07.030> cavernous<00:05:07.479> place

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:07.990 
and not part of a larger cavernous place

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:10.529 
and not part of a larger cavernous place
but<00:05:08.259> I'm<00:05:08.380> fine<00:05:09.370> a<00:05:09.400> small<00:05:09.669> space<00:05:09.910> the<00:05:10.360> other

00:05:10.529 --> 00:05:10.539 
but I'm fine a small space the other

00:05:10.539 --> 00:05:12.089 
but I'm fine a small space the other
thing<00:05:10.840> to<00:05:10.930> worry<00:05:11.080> about<00:05:11.139> jetpacks<00:05:11.800> is<00:05:11.949> that

00:05:12.089 --> 00:05:12.099 
thing to worry about jetpacks is that

00:05:12.099 --> 00:05:13.890 
thing to worry about jetpacks is that
they<00:05:12.280> can<00:05:12.520> chase<00:05:12.759> you<00:05:13.000> look<00:05:13.539> at<00:05:13.660> your<00:05:13.780> health

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:13.900 
they can chase you look at your health

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:15.390 
they can chase you look at your health
on<00:05:14.080> the<00:05:14.169> bottom<00:05:14.440> left<00:05:14.650> when<00:05:14.889> that<00:05:15.009> starts

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:15.400 
on the bottom left when that starts

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:17.790 
on the bottom left when that starts
getting<00:05:15.460> down<00:05:15.910> to<00:05:16.120> about<00:05:16.150> two-thirds<00:05:16.930> you

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:17.800 
getting down to about two-thirds you

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:18.990 
getting down to about two-thirds you
want<00:05:17.979> to<00:05:18.070> get<00:05:18.190> out<00:05:18.370> of<00:05:18.550> wherever<00:05:18.759> you<00:05:18.970> are

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:19.000 
want to get out of wherever you are

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.029 
want to get out of wherever you are
because<00:05:19.360> if<00:05:19.539> Marines<00:05:19.900> kill<00:05:20.229> you<00:05:20.410> you're<00:05:20.919> going

00:05:21.029 --> 00:05:21.039 
because if Marines kill you you're going

00:05:21.039 --> 00:05:22.830 
because if Marines kill you you're going
to<00:05:21.099> be<00:05:21.220> in<00:05:21.460> what<00:05:22.270> you're<00:05:22.389> going<00:05:22.509> to<00:05:22.570> be<00:05:22.660> dead

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:22.840 
to be in what you're going to be dead

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:25.710 
to be in what you're going to be dead
it's<00:05:23.110> really<00:05:23.349> the<00:05:23.710> issue<00:05:23.949> with<00:05:24.220> that<00:05:24.250> so<00:05:24.880> you

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:25.720 
it's really the issue with that so you

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:27.480 
it's really the issue with that so you
need<00:05:25.900> to<00:05:26.020> always<00:05:26.169> have<00:05:26.440> your<00:05:26.470> retreat<00:05:26.979> path<00:05:27.220> in

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:27.490 
need to always have your retreat path in

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:28.710 
need to always have your retreat path in
mind<00:05:27.759> as<00:05:28.000> an<00:05:28.120> OU<00:05:28.240> knows<00:05:28.419> you<00:05:28.570> are<00:05:28.599> not

00:05:28.710 --> 00:05:28.720 
mind as an OU knows you are not

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:31.499 
mind as an OU knows you are not
invincible<00:05:29.259> and<00:05:29.710> the<00:05:30.310> best<00:05:30.520> onus<00:05:30.910> is<00:05:31.090> really

00:05:31.499 --> 00:05:31.509 
invincible and the best onus is really

00:05:31.509 --> 00:05:33.360 
invincible and the best onus is really
come<00:05:31.690> down<00:05:31.720> to<00:05:31.949> what<00:05:32.949> makes<00:05:33.130> you<00:05:33.220> a<00:05:33.250> good

00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:33.370 
come down to what makes you a good

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:34.710 
come down to what makes you a good
honest<00:05:33.699> or<00:05:33.820> not<00:05:33.970> it<00:05:34.120> really<00:05:34.150> comes<00:05:34.539> down<00:05:34.599> to

00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:34.720 
honest or not it really comes down to

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:36.629 
honest or not it really comes down to
how<00:05:34.990> good<00:05:35.229> you<00:05:35.380> are<00:05:35.410> retreating<00:05:36.009> knowing<00:05:36.430> when

00:05:36.629 --> 00:05:36.639 
how good you are retreating knowing when

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:38.810 
how good you are retreating knowing when
where<00:05:36.940> to<00:05:37.120> retreat<00:05:37.479> a<00:05:37.690> good<00:05:38.139> tip<00:05:38.349> is<00:05:38.560> that

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:38.820 
where to retreat a good tip is that

00:05:38.820 --> 00:05:40.890 
where to retreat a good tip is that
normally<00:05:39.820> what<00:05:40.000> you<00:05:40.090> want<00:05:40.270> to<00:05:40.360> do<00:05:40.419> is<00:05:40.570> retreat

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:47.560 
better retreat and the Marines will be

better retreat and the Marines will be
like<00:05:47.710> how<00:05:47.889> we<00:05:47.949> got<00:05:48.250> them<00:05:48.400> what<00:05:48.849> a<00:05:48.880> sucker<00:05:49.150> and

Marines will have to chase an illness

00:05:52.449 --> 00:05:54.000 
Marines will have to chase an illness
it's<00:05:52.750> the<00:05:52.840> only<00:05:53.080> way<00:05:53.199> to<00:05:53.260> kill<00:05:53.440> them<00:05:53.500> because<00:05:53.979> a
