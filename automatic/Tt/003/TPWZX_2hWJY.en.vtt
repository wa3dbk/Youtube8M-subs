there<00:00:00.210> could<00:00:00.539> even<00:00:00.570> be<00:00:00.870> stacked<00:00:01.319> high<00:00:01.650> yeah<00:00:02.070> in

00:00:02.419 --> 00:00:02.429 
there could even be stacked high yeah in

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:04.880 
there could even be stacked high yeah in
the<00:00:02.580> same<00:00:02.820> arrangement<00:00:03.149> as<00:00:03.540> far<00:00:04.410> as<00:00:04.529> you<00:00:04.680> want

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890 
the same arrangement as far as you want

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.039 
the same arrangement as far as you want
to<00:00:04.950> go<00:00:05.100> and<00:00:05.819> they'll<00:00:05.970> always<00:00:06.210> line<00:00:06.629> up<00:00:06.660> exactly

00:00:07.039 --> 00:00:07.049 
to go and they'll always line up exactly

00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:09.530 
to go and they'll always line up exactly
where<00:00:07.529> you<00:00:07.950> wanted<00:00:08.220> to<00:00:08.309> line<00:00:08.519> up<00:00:08.730> and<00:00:09.269> again

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:09.540 
where you wanted to line up and again

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.839 
where you wanted to line up and again
these<00:00:09.690> have<00:00:09.929> any<00:00:10.290> where<00:00:10.530> they<00:00:11.460> look<00:00:11.700> like

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.750 
but yeah you get together at all yeah I
know<00:00:46.379> the<00:00:46.920> other<00:00:47.070> side<00:00:47.309> of<00:00:47.340> the<00:00:47.489> spacecraft

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
know the other side of the spacecraft

00:00:47.760 --> 00:01:10.320 
know the other side of the spacecraft
works<00:00:48.329> in<00:00:48.480> this<00:00:48.600> up

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:10.330

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
that is all that is amazing look at that

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:15.340 
that is all that is amazing look at that
it<00:02:09.270> just<00:02:09.479> cleaved<00:02:10.160> that<00:02:11.160> well<00:02:11.760> that's<00:02:12.240> cleared

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:15.350 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:19.450 

this<00:02:15.890> is<00:02:16.040> hot<00:02:16.430> this<00:02:16.670> is<00:02:16.820> as<00:02:16.970> far<00:02:17.210> as<00:02:17.480> the<00:02:18.460> cup

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:19.460 
this is hot this is as far as the cup

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:22.420 
this is hot this is as far as the cup
went<00:02:19.760> and<00:02:20.060> it<00:02:20.240> just<00:02:20.450> you<00:02:21.260> saw<00:02:21.500> it<00:02:21.710> it's<00:02:21.980> just<00:02:22.160> a
