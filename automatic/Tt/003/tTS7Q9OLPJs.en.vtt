00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:10.710 
start by saying that a lot of spider

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.789 
start by saying that a lot of spider
solitaire<00:00:11.250> games<00:00:11.630> only<00:00:12.630> show<00:00:13.019> a<00:00:13.049> single<00:00:13.559> suit

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:13.799

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:15.470 
solitaire games only show a single suit
least<00:00:14.099> computer<00:00:14.610> games<00:00:14.849> when<00:00:15.120> you<00:00:15.179> play<00:00:15.360> with

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:15.480 
least computer games when you play with

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.660 
least computer games when you play with
the<00:00:15.599> deck<00:00:15.780> of<00:00:15.809> cards<00:00:16.320> however<00:00:16.650> you<00:00:17.310> play<00:00:17.550> with

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
the deck of cards however you play with

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.070 
the deck of cards however you play with
all<00:00:17.820> the<00:00:17.940> cards<00:00:18.240> and<00:00:18.390> you<00:00:18.449> just<00:00:18.600> ignore<00:00:18.900> the

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
all the cards and you just ignore the

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.310 
all the cards and you just ignore the
suit<00:00:19.320> so<00:00:19.590> I'm<00:00:19.970> following<00:00:20.970> that<00:00:21.270> line<00:00:22.260> of

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
suit so I'm following that line of

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.050 
suit so I'm following that line of
reasoning<00:00:22.529> in<00:00:23.039> this<00:00:23.189> instead<00:00:23.580> of<00:00:23.640> the<00:00:23.789> one

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
reasoning in this instead of the one

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.359 
reasoning in this instead of the one
where<00:00:24.269> I<00:00:24.449> make<00:00:25.019> all<00:00:25.260> of<00:00:25.289> the<00:00:25.560> suits<00:00:25.830> the<00:00:26.099> same

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:26.369 
where I make all of the suits the same

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:28.790 
where I make all of the suits the same
like<00:00:27.240> all<00:00:27.480> spades<00:00:27.869> or<00:00:28.230> something<00:00:28.590> like<00:00:28.740> that

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:28.800 
like all spades or something like that

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.950 
like all spades or something like that
just<00:00:29.220> because<00:00:30.000> I<00:00:30.090> like<00:00:30.330> to<00:00:30.449> have<00:00:30.539> a<00:00:30.599> little<00:00:30.750> bit

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
just because I like to have a little bit

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.470 
just because I like to have a little bit
of<00:00:30.990> variety<00:00:31.520> so<00:00:32.520> don't<00:00:32.759> try<00:00:33.059> and<00:00:33.120> you<00:00:33.450> know

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
of variety so don't try and you know

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.620 
of variety so don't try and you know

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
is from King to ace build down this way

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.369

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
gets removed so start out by just doing

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.660 
gets removed so start out by just doing
some<00:01:03.870> building

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:06.670 

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:14.520 

and<00:01:07.390> I<00:01:07.570> can<00:01:07.750> move<00:01:07.930> the<00:01:08.170> three<00:01:08.470> over<00:01:08.770> to<00:01:08.860> here

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:14.530 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:16.810 

seven

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820 
seven

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.160 
seven
okay<00:01:17.450> so

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
okay so

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.940 
okay so
this<00:01:19.770> is<00:01:19.950> a<00:01:19.979> fully<00:01:20.310> packed<00:01:20.670> run<00:01:21.090> from<00:01:21.830> seven<00:01:22.830> to

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
this is a fully packed run from seven to

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.920 
this is a fully packed run from seven to
two<00:01:23.189> now<00:01:23.490> I<00:01:23.549> can't<00:01:23.880> grab<00:01:24.180> any<00:01:24.390> of<00:01:24.509> the<00:01:24.570> cards<00:01:24.900> in

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:24.930 
two now I can't grab any of the cards in

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.660 
two now I can't grab any of the cards in
the<00:01:25.020> middle<00:01:25.290> like<00:01:25.439> I<00:01:25.590> can't<00:01:25.860> grab<00:01:26.100> this<00:01:26.280> six

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:26.670 
the middle like I can't grab this six

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.609 
the middle like I can't grab this six
and<00:01:26.909> move<00:01:27.030> it<00:01:27.150> over<00:01:27.210> there<00:01:27.360> I<00:01:27.750> can<00:01:28.200> only<00:01:28.259> grab

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
and move it over there I can only grab

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.820 
and move it over there I can only grab
by<00:01:28.799> the<00:01:28.860> seven<00:01:29.310> or<00:01:29.430> I<00:01:29.490> could<00:01:29.670> grab<00:01:29.820> by<00:01:30.030> the<00:01:30.090> two

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:30.830 
by the seven or I could grab by the two

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:33.830 
by the seven or I could grab by the two
so<00:01:31.830> it's<00:01:32.070> little<00:01:32.310> limiting<00:01:32.759> you<00:01:33.270> can't<00:01:33.600> say

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:33.840 
so it's little limiting you can't say

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:35.420 
so it's little limiting you can't say
grab<00:01:34.140> the<00:01:34.320> three<00:01:34.590> in<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.830> two<00:01:34.979> and<00:01:35.190> move<00:01:35.310> it

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:35.430 
grab the three in the two and move it

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.660 
grab the three in the two and move it
over<00:01:35.490> to<00:01:35.640> this<00:01:35.880> for<00:01:36.330> so<00:01:37.080> you<00:01:37.170> can<00:01:37.409> only<00:01:37.500> get<00:01:37.799> you

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
over to this for so you can only get you

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:41.660 
over to this for so you can only get you
can<00:01:38.850> only<00:01:39.060> move<00:01:39.390> a<00:01:39.570> fully<00:01:39.810> packed<00:01:40.110> run<00:01:40.520> so<00:01:41.520> when

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
can only move a fully packed run so when

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.030 
can only move a fully packed run so when
you<00:01:41.759> run<00:01:41.909> out<00:01:41.939> of<00:01:42.060> moves<00:01:42.390> that<00:01:42.509> you<00:01:42.689> can<00:01:42.840> make

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
you run out of moves that you can make

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.940 
you run out of moves that you can make
you<00:01:44.700> can<00:01:44.910> click<00:01:45.120> the<00:01:45.270> deck<00:01:45.480> down<00:01:45.690> here<00:01:46.170> and<00:01:46.830> it

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:46.950 
you can click the deck down here and it

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.110 
you can click the deck down here and it
deals<00:01:47.190> one<00:01:47.550> more<00:01:47.760> card<00:01:48.350> to<00:01:49.350> each<00:01:49.380> column<00:01:50.120> now

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:51.120 
deals one more card to each column now

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.580 
deals one more card to each column now
that<00:01:51.270> kind<00:01:51.450> of<00:01:51.480> messes<00:01:51.810> things<00:01:52.020> up

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:53.590 
that kind of messes things up

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:56.639 
that kind of messes things up
but<00:01:54.280> because<00:01:54.640> now<00:01:54.850> you<00:01:55.450> don't<00:01:55.659> have<00:01:55.750> any<00:01:56.020> fully

00:01:56.639 --> 00:01:56.649 
but because now you don't have any fully

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:00.959 
but because now you don't have any fully
packed<00:01:57.060> series<00:01:58.799> you<00:01:59.799> can<00:02:00.070> sometimes<00:02:00.700> if<00:02:00.880> you

00:02:00.959 --> 00:02:00.969 
packed series you can sometimes if you

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:03.090 
packed series you can sometimes if you
get<00:02:01.060> lucky<00:02:01.210> but<00:02:01.539> not<00:02:01.899> in<00:02:02.020> this<00:02:02.140> case<00:02:02.200> so<00:02:03.039> I'm

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:03.100 
get lucky but not in this case so I'm

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:04.889 
get lucky but not in this case so I'm
going<00:02:03.159> to<00:02:03.280> move<00:02:03.429> the<00:02:03.609> eighth<00:02:03.850> over<00:02:04.299> here<00:02:04.689> and

00:02:04.889 --> 00:02:04.899 
going to move the eighth over here and
