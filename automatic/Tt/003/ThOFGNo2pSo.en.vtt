00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
the original beetle which this is based

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.360 
the original beetle which this is based
on<00:00:42.149> so<00:00:42.719> kind<00:00:43.020> of<00:00:43.050> a<00:00:43.140> unique<00:00:43.559> and<00:00:43.800> ingenious

on so kind of a unique and ingenious

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.510 
on so kind of a unique and ingenious
little<00:00:44.730> flipper<00:00:45.239> let<00:00:46.079> me<00:00:46.140> go<00:00:46.260> ahead<00:00:46.530> and<00:00:46.739> put

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
little flipper let me go ahead and put

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.790 
little flipper let me go ahead and put
that<00:00:47.700> out<00:00:48.590> so<00:00:49.590> this<00:00:50.250> mechanic<00:00:50.760> here<00:00:51.649> holds<00:00:52.649> the

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
that out so this mechanic here holds the

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.040 
that out so this mechanic here holds the
knife<00:00:52.980> it's<00:00:53.219> kind<00:00:53.430> of<00:00:53.489> the<00:00:53.610> lock<00:00:54.120> if<00:00:54.420> you<00:00:54.840> will

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
knife it's kind of the lock if you will

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.930 
knife it's kind of the lock if you will
just<00:00:55.530> a<00:00:55.710> little<00:00:56.010> pressure<00:00:56.280> on<00:00:56.430> that<00:00:56.640> will<00:00:56.760> hold

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
just a little pressure on that will hold

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.439 
just a little pressure on that will hold
it<00:00:57.149> you'll<00:00:57.570> notice<00:00:58.039> when<00:00:59.039> you're<00:00:59.190> not<00:00:59.550> you<00:01:00.300> can

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
it you'll notice when you're not you can

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:02.779 
it you'll notice when you're not you can
close<00:01:00.690> it<00:01:00.719> there<00:01:01.410> there's<00:01:02.100> no<00:01:02.280> lock<00:01:02.520> so<00:01:02.730> you

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
close it there there's no lock so you

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:05.810 
close it there there's no lock so you
can<00:01:02.969> just<00:01:03.149> flip<00:01:03.870> it<00:01:03.989> back<00:01:04.140> close<00:01:04.580> flip<00:01:05.580> it<00:01:05.700> open

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
can just flip it back close flip it open

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.600 
can just flip it back close flip it open
that<00:01:06.180> action<00:01:06.630> is<00:01:06.750> super<00:01:07.170> smooth<00:01:07.500> it<00:01:08.250> can<00:01:08.460> be

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
that action is super smooth it can be

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:13.310 
that action is super smooth it can be
slow<00:01:09.450> or<00:01:10.280> quick<00:01:11.280> depending<00:01:12.030> on<00:01:12.150> how<00:01:13.140> much

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:13.320 
slow or quick depending on how much

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:15.350 
slow or quick depending on how much
pressure<00:01:13.560> you<00:01:13.890> put<00:01:13.920> on<00:01:14.100> and<00:01:14.430> then<00:01:14.880> just<00:01:14.939> by

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
pressure you put on and then just by

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.600 
pressure you put on and then just by
pinching<00:01:15.840> that<00:01:16.020> lever<00:01:16.259> on<00:01:16.470> the<00:01:16.500> bottom<00:01:16.979> and<00:01:17.220> it

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
pinching that lever on the bottom and it

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:18.620 
pinching that lever on the bottom and it
doesn't<00:01:17.909> have<00:01:18.030> to<00:01:18.119> be<00:01:18.240> hard

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
doesn't have to be hard

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:21.620 
doesn't have to be hard
it<00:01:18.750> holds<00:01:19.290> the<00:01:19.560> blade<00:01:19.860> in<00:01:20.070> place<00:01:20.479> if<00:01:21.479> you're

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
it holds the blade in place if you're

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.080 
it holds the blade in place if you're
not<00:01:21.689> holding<00:01:21.990> it<00:01:22.229> you<00:01:22.740> can<00:01:22.890> close<00:01:23.130> it<00:01:23.159> just<00:01:24.060> a

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
not holding it you can close it just a

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.020 
not holding it you can close it just a
little<00:01:24.299> pressure<00:01:24.509> holds<00:01:25.470> it<00:01:25.619> and<00:01:25.799> if<00:01:26.670> you<00:01:26.880> are

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
little pressure holds it and if you are

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.670 
little pressure holds it and if you are
still<00:01:27.299> worried<00:01:27.570> that<00:01:27.689> it<00:01:27.840> might<00:01:27.930> slip<00:01:28.290> on<00:01:28.500> you

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
still worried that it might slip on you

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.130 
still worried that it might slip on you
they<00:01:29.130> have<00:01:29.430> included<00:01:30.030> a<00:01:30.180> safety<00:01:30.600> lock<00:01:30.750> here

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
they have included a safety lock here

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.140 
they have included a safety lock here
just<00:01:31.740> flip<00:01:31.979> that<00:01:32.130> up<00:01:32.310> till<00:01:32.549> it<00:01:32.640> clicks<00:01:32.850> and

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
just flip that up till it clicks and

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.410 
just flip that up till it clicks and
then<00:01:33.659> that<00:01:34.049> holds<00:01:34.470> in<00:01:34.590> place<00:01:35.030> even<00:01:36.030> without

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
then that holds in place even without

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.370 
then that holds in place even without
pressure<00:01:36.689> on<00:01:37.110> the<00:01:37.860> lever<00:01:38.689> click<00:01:39.689> it<00:01:39.840> back<00:01:40.020> and

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380 
pressure on the lever click it back and

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.030 
pressure on the lever click it back and
you<00:01:41.009> can<00:01:41.220> close<00:01:41.490> it<00:01:41.700> right<00:01:41.939> up<00:01:42.210> so<00:01:43.079> that<00:01:43.439> is<00:01:43.619> tip

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
you can close it right up so that is tip

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.090 
you can close it right up so that is tip
up<00:01:44.250> for<00:01:44.790> the<00:01:45.270> pocket<00:01:45.420> clip<00:01:45.750> right<00:01:46.439> or<00:01:46.740> left

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
up for the pocket clip right or left

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.710 
up for the pocket clip right or left
carry<00:01:47.460> let<00:01:47.790> me<00:01:47.850> go<00:01:47.970> ahead<00:01:48.090> and<00:01:48.270> give<00:01:48.540> you<00:01:48.630> a
