to get music back into his life to
therapy<00:01:10.580> trying<00:01:10.880> to<00:01:10.940> play<00:01:11.090> guitar<00:01:11.210> again<00:01:11.660> and

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:12.020 
therapy trying to play guitar again and

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:13.420 
therapy trying to play guitar again and
I<00:01:12.290> wanted<00:01:12.500> to<00:01:12.560> give<00:01:12.680> him<00:01:12.800> the<00:01:12.920> best<00:01:13.070> chance<00:01:13.160> to

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:13.430 
I wanted to give him the best chance to

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:17.770 
I wanted to give him the best chance to
play<00:01:13.700> again<00:01:13.970> so<00:01:14.270> I<00:01:14.649> created<00:01:15.649> rowboat<00:01:16.100> are<00:01:16.780> the

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780 
play again so I created rowboat are the

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:19.600 
play again so I created rowboat are the
first<00:01:18.020> prototype<00:01:18.440> was<00:01:18.920> rather<00:01:19.160> large<00:01:19.490> and

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:19.610 
first prototype was rather large and

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:21.370 
first prototype was rather large and
clunky<00:01:20.000> but<00:01:20.210> we<00:01:20.509> finally<00:01:20.720> ended<00:01:21.050> up<00:01:21.170> on<00:01:21.350> a

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380 
clunky but we finally ended up on a

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.550 
clunky but we finally ended up on a
smaller<00:01:21.800> sleeker<00:01:22.759> and<00:01:23.030> more<00:01:23.720> robust<00:01:24.259> device

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:24.560 
smaller sleeker and more robust device

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.410 
smaller sleeker and more robust device
with<00:01:24.830> some<00:01:25.009> great<00:01:25.160> software<00:01:25.580> that<00:01:25.819> comes<00:01:26.270> with

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:26.420 
with some great software that comes with

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:27.660 
with some great software that comes with
it

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:27.670 
it

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:30.100 
it
so<00:01:28.670> this<00:01:28.880> is<00:01:29.030> the<00:01:29.180> world's<00:01:29.510> first<00:01:29.720> inflatable

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:30.110 
so this is the world's first inflatable

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:32.560 
so this is the world's first inflatable
robotic<00:01:30.770> arm<00:01:30.950> this<00:01:31.550> is<00:01:31.670> entirely<00:01:32.090> made<00:01:32.450> of

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:42.560 
were to deflate this arm you could roll

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:44.350 
were to deflate this arm you could roll
it<00:01:42.710> up<00:01:42.830> and<00:01:42.950> put<00:01:43.130> it<00:01:43.160> your<00:01:43.340> sock<00:01:43.550> drawer<00:01:43.580> well

the<00:01:44.450> beauty<00:01:44.720> of<00:01:44.810> this<00:01:45.440> inflatable

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070 
the beauty of this inflatable

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:48.190 
the beauty of this inflatable
architecture<00:01:46.729> is<00:01:46.970> it<00:01:47.180> allows<00:01:47.420> us<00:01:47.450> to<00:01:47.900> use<00:01:47.930> a

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:48.200 
architecture is it allows us to use a

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.680 
architecture is it allows us to use a
new<00:01:48.619> heaven<00:01:49.100> material<00:01:49.580> set<00:01:49.760> then<00:01:49.970> it<00:01:50.060> gets<00:01:50.210> to

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:50.690 
new heaven material set then it gets to

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:52.030 
new heaven material set then it gets to
higher<00:01:50.900> strength<00:01:51.229> materials<00:01:51.680> in<00:01:51.770> the<00:01:51.860> field

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:52.040 
higher strength materials in the field

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.100 
higher strength materials in the field
and<00:01:52.190> aluminum<00:01:52.640> well<00:01:53.150> being<00:01:53.390> completely<00:01:53.810> safe

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:54.110 
and aluminum well being completely safe

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:56.020 
and aluminum well being completely safe
and<00:01:54.320> compliant<00:01:54.619> around<00:01:54.950> people<00:01:55.280> so<00:01:55.790> what<00:01:55.880> this

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:56.030 
and compliant around people so what this

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.810 
and compliant around people so what this
means<00:01:56.330> is<00:01:56.660> we<00:01:57.050> can<00:01:57.229> make<00:01:57.470> robots<00:01:58.190> that<00:01:58.430> are<00:01:58.490> as

00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:58.820 
means is we can make robots that are as

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:00.730 
means is we can make robots that are as
strong<00:01:59.119> as<00:01:59.450> current<00:01:59.780> industrial<00:02:00.050> manipulate

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:00.740 
strong as current industrial manipulate

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:02.950 
strong as current industrial manipulate
industrial<00:02:01.310> arms<00:02:01.580> but<00:02:02.180> for<00:02:02.330> a<00:02:02.360> temp<00:02:02.600> to<00:02:02.780> wait

industrial arms but for a temp to wait
at<00:02:03.350> the<00:02:03.380> cost<00:02:04.479> we're<00:02:05.479> an<00:02:05.570> experimental<00:02:06.200> design

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
at the cost we're an experimental design

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.449 
at the cost we're an experimental design

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:11.890 
studio that's looking at ways to combine
algorithmic<00:02:10.459> design<00:02:10.610> with<00:02:11.239> digital

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
algorithmic design with digital

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.330 
algorithmic design with digital
fabrication<00:02:12.020> to<00:02:12.560> create<00:02:12.800> one-of-a-kind

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:13.340 
fabrication to create one-of-a-kind

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.370 
fabrication to create one-of-a-kind
customized<00:02:13.940> products<00:02:14.480> so<00:02:14.930> we're<00:02:15.080> looking<00:02:15.170> at

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:15.380 
customized products so we're looking at

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.320 
customized products so we're looking at
ways<00:02:15.530> to<00:02:15.590> take<00:02:16.040> 3d<00:02:16.820> printing<00:02:17.180> which

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.330 
ways to take 3d printing which

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.449 
ways to take 3d printing which
essentially<00:02:17.810> produces<00:02:18.290> this<00:02:18.470> rigid<00:02:18.950> plastic

00:02:19.449 --> 00:02:19.459 
essentially produces this rigid plastic

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:21.910 
essentially produces this rigid plastic
material<00:02:19.910> and<00:02:20.120> turn<00:02:20.600> it<00:02:20.750> into<00:02:20.900> really<00:02:21.440> a<00:02:21.530> body

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
material and turn it into really a body

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.850 
material and turn it into really a body
conforming<00:02:22.580> wearable<00:02:22.970> textile<00:02:23.540> that<00:02:24.320> anybody

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:24.860 
conforming wearable textile that anybody

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.400 
conforming wearable textile that anybody
can<00:02:25.070> design<00:02:25.430> and<00:02:26.060> at<00:02:26.570> affordable<00:02:27.020> price<00:02:27.170> point

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:27.410 
can design and at affordable price point

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:28.720 
can design and at affordable price point
essentially<00:02:27.920> you<00:02:28.340> don't<00:02:28.489> have<00:02:28.580> to<00:02:28.640> be<00:02:28.700> a

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
essentially you don't have to be a

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:30.550 
essentially you don't have to be a
designer<00:02:28.880> have<00:02:29.420> skill<00:02:29.690> with<00:02:29.870> CAD<00:02:30.050> tools<00:02:30.350> or

00:02:30.550 --> 00:02:30.560 
designer have skill with CAD tools or

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.500 
designer have skill with CAD tools or
programming<00:02:31.070> or<00:02:31.190> whatever<00:02:31.519> you<00:02:32.150> can<00:02:32.239> just<00:02:32.390> go

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
programming or whatever you can just go

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:34.060 
programming or whatever you can just go
on<00:02:32.660> to<00:02:32.780> the<00:02:32.870> site<00:02:33.049> and<00:02:33.170> start<00:02:33.290> sculpting<00:02:33.650> and

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.070 
on to the site and start sculpting and

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:37.060 
on to the site and start sculpting and
creating<00:02:34.580> very<00:02:35.360> complex<00:02:36.070> articulated

yourself using kinematics we also are
working<00:02:45.890> on<00:02:46.250> a<00:02:46.280> new<00:02:46.519> application<00:02:46.670> for

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.030 
working on a new application for

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:50.140

shirts skirts etc that's not available
yet<00:02:52.880> but<00:02:53.180> it'll<00:02:53.450> be<00:02:53.480> available<00:02:53.720> within<00:02:54.290> the

00:02:54.430 --> 00:02:54.440 
yet but it'll be available within the

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.310
