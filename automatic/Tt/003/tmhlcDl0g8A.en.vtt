just<00:00:31.470> have<00:00:31.830> two<00:00:32.009> instead<00:00:32.279> of<00:00:32.340> one<00:00:32.430> because

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
just have two instead of one because

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.790 
just have two instead of one because
it's<00:00:32.969> hopefully<00:00:33.960> would<00:00:34.079> last<00:00:34.290> longer<00:00:34.559> without

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:34.800 
it's hopefully would last longer without

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.869

one nine volt battery and because it's
all<00:02:30.420> that<00:02:30.570> would<00:02:30.720> fit<00:02:31.430> and<00:02:32.430> basically<00:02:33.060> these

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:33.209 
all that would fit and basically these

00:02:33.209 --> 00:02:34.340 
all that would fit and basically these
are<00:02:33.270> the<00:02:33.450> same<00:02:33.780> thing

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:34.350 
are the same thing

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.860 
are the same thing
the<00:02:35.310> only<00:02:35.550> major<00:02:35.880> difference<00:02:36.150> that<00:02:36.510> you<00:02:36.570> might

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 
the only major difference that you might

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.110 
the only major difference that you might
be<00:02:37.020> able<00:02:37.080> to<00:02:37.230> see<00:02:37.530> from<00:02:38.280> the<00:02:38.400> other<00:02:38.580> one<00:02:38.790> is

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
be able to see from the other one is

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.740 
be able to see from the other one is
that<00:02:39.420> these<00:02:40.700> voltage<00:02:41.700> divider<00:02:42.060> capacitors

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:42.750 
that these voltage divider capacitors

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:49.220 
that these voltage divider capacitors
are<00:02:44.570> different<00:02:45.570> 116<00:02:46.560> and<00:02:46.650> 125<00:02:47.580> volts<00:02:48.230> and

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
are different 116 and 125 volts and

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:50.660 
are different 116 and 125 volts and
they're<00:02:49.380> just<00:02:49.530> you<00:02:49.860> know<00:02:49.890> ripped<00:02:50.160> off<00:02:50.310> circuit

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
they're just you know ripped off circuit

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.060 
they're just you know ripped off circuit
boards<00:02:50.910> and<00:02:51.060> stuff<00:02:51.300> and<00:02:51.540> I<00:02:51.630> don't<00:02:51.930> know<00:02:52.110> if<00:02:52.530> it

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
boards and stuff and I don't know if it

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:54.590 
boards and stuff and I don't know if it
they<00:02:53.340> have<00:02:53.459> to<00:02:53.489> be<00:02:53.580> simple<00:02:54.000> to<00:02:54.150> do<00:02:54.270> or<00:02:54.420> if<00:02:54.480> it

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:54.600 
they have to be simple to do or if it

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.330 
they have to be simple to do or if it
works<00:02:54.780> fine<00:02:55.020> for<00:02:55.050> me<00:02:55.350> so<00:02:55.590> I'm<00:02:55.709> just<00:02:55.860> like<00:02:56.040> I'll

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340 
works fine for me so I'm just like I'll

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.260 
works fine for me so I'm just like I'll
leave<00:02:56.520> it<00:02:56.670> like<00:02:56.700> that<00:02:56.820> and<00:02:57.650> yeah<00:02:58.650> and<00:02:59.640> there's

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.270 
leave it like that and yeah and there's

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:02.270 
leave it like that and yeah and there's
also<00:03:00.420> these<00:03:00.690> big<00:03:00.959> yellow<00:03:01.200> things<00:03:01.590> which<00:03:02.130> in

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:02.280 
also these big yellow things which in

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.610 
also these big yellow things which in
comparison<00:03:02.430> to<00:03:03.830> see<00:03:04.830> those<00:03:05.610> are<00:03:05.790> basically

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
comparison to see those are basically

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:10.940 
comparison to see those are basically
that<00:03:07.620> was<00:03:07.800> the<00:03:08.040> input<00:03:08.790> capacitors<00:03:09.950> they

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:10.950 
that was the input capacitors they

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:12.350 
that was the input capacitors they
really<00:03:11.310> don't<00:03:11.430> sound<00:03:11.760> that<00:03:11.850> much<00:03:11.940> different

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.360 
really don't sound that much different

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.800 
really don't sound that much different
to<00:03:12.390> me<00:03:12.570> the<00:03:13.020> old<00:03:13.230> ones<00:03:13.410> I<00:03:13.530> had<00:03:13.680> in<00:03:13.800> here<00:03:13.920> before

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
to me the old ones I had in here before

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:17.810 
to me the old ones I had in here before
actually<00:03:15.810> like<00:03:15.989> kind<00:03:16.890> of<00:03:17.070> reduced<00:03:17.430> the<00:03:17.610> bass

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:17.820 
actually like kind of reduced the bass

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:19.850 
actually like kind of reduced the bass
by<00:03:18.090> a<00:03:18.120> lot<00:03:18.390> and<00:03:18.780> I<00:03:18.900> think<00:03:18.989> cuz<00:03:19.380> the<00:03:19.530> value

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
by a lot and I think cuz the value

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:21.560 
by a lot and I think cuz the value
wouldn't<00:03:20.190> wasn't<00:03:20.670> correct<00:03:20.940> or<00:03:21.090> something<00:03:21.390> but

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570 
wouldn't wasn't correct or something but

00:03:21.570 --> 00:03:24.320 
wouldn't wasn't correct or something but
you<00:03:21.750> know<00:03:21.870> I<00:03:22.110> don't<00:03:22.860> there<00:03:23.459> was<00:03:23.580> no<00:03:23.700> evaluating

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:24.330 
you know I don't there was no evaluating

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:27.590 
you know I don't there was no evaluating
on<00:03:24.450> them<00:03:24.600> so<00:03:25.549> yeah<00:03:26.549> I<00:03:26.580> got<00:03:26.760> got<00:03:27.120> these<00:03:27.269> off<00:03:27.450> of

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:27.600 
on them so yeah I got got these off of

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:31.130 
on them so yeah I got got these off of
ebay<00:03:27.720> and<00:03:28.640> now<00:03:29.640> it<00:03:29.760> sounds<00:03:29.880> good<00:03:30.209> to<00:03:30.810> my<00:03:30.930> ears

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
ebay and now it sounds good to my ears

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.370 
ebay and now it sounds good to my ears
and<00:03:32.030> yeah<00:03:33.030> that's<00:03:33.510> what<00:03:34.049> I've<00:03:34.140> been<00:03:34.170> working

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
and yeah that's what I've been working

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:40.400 
and yeah that's what I've been working
on<00:03:34.680> and<00:03:36.709> yeah<00:03:37.709> that's<00:03:38.190> it
