showing you how to get the data pack on

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.049 
showing you how to get the data pack on
top<00:00:07.680> of<00:00:07.859> the<00:00:07.950> hatch<00:00:08.189> out<00:00:08.460> for<00:00:08.610> the<00:00:08.700> Mad<00:00:08.849> Hatter

bane of many of yours no pun intended
now<00:00:15.809> the<00:00:15.870> guide<00:00:16.139> tells<00:00:16.980> us<00:00:17.279> to<00:00:17.779> use<00:00:18.779> the<00:00:19.260> drop

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
now the guide tells us to use the drop

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.340 
now the guide tells us to use the drop
point<00:00:19.830> as<00:00:20.250> the<00:00:21.210> highest<00:00:21.510> altitude<00:00:21.960> point<00:00:22.230> that

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
point as the highest altitude point that

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:24.920 
point as the highest altitude point that
we<00:00:22.410> get<00:00:22.680> and<00:00:22.920> light<00:00:23.460> into<00:00:23.820> it<00:00:23.939> from<00:00:24.029> there<00:00:24.330> I'll

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:37.350 
experience with it alright so let's go

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:51.819 
experience with it alright so let's go
to<00:00:37.410> the<00:00:37.530> dropship

00:00:51.819 --> 00:00:51.829 

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:54.319 

all<00:00:52.829> right<00:00:53.040> I<00:00:53.130> couldn't<00:00:53.579> glide<00:00:53.790> until<00:00:53.970> right

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
all right I couldn't glide until right

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:57.530 
all right I couldn't glide until right
there<00:00:55.610> now<00:00:56.610> obviously<00:00:56.970> that's<00:00:57.150> not<00:00:57.390> high

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:57.540 
there now obviously that's not high

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:58.660 
there now obviously that's not high
enough

00:00:58.660 --> 00:00:58.670 
enough

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:01.700

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.620 

and<00:01:50.490> those<00:01:51.490> are<00:01:51.640> the<00:01:51.729> gargoyles<00:01:52.359> that<00:01:52.479> you're

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:52.630 
and those are the gargoyles that you're

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:59.219 
and those are the gargoyles that you're
going<00:01:52.750> to<00:01:52.810> use<00:01:53.049> to<00:01:53.799> get<00:01:53.950> elevation<00:01:58.049> now<00:01:59.049> what

00:01:59.219 --> 00:01:59.229 
going to use to get elevation now what

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:00.660 
going to use to get elevation now what
we're<00:01:59.380> going<00:01:59.530> to<00:01:59.679> do<00:01:59.979> is<00:02:00.250> we're<00:02:00.399> going<00:02:00.490> to<00:02:00.549> go

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
we're going to do is we're going to go

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:02.160 
we're going to do is we're going to go
to<00:02:00.729> that<00:02:00.880> furthest<00:02:01.299> gargoyle<00:02:01.780> over<00:02:01.990> there

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 
to that furthest gargoyle over there

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.090 
to that furthest gargoyle over there
right<00:02:02.409> here<00:02:02.679> and<00:02:04.079> we're<00:02:05.079> going<00:02:05.229> to<00:02:05.259> jump<00:02:05.829> to

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
right here and we're going to jump to

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.550 
right here and we're going to jump to
the<00:02:06.459> other<00:02:06.490> gargoyle<00:02:07.420> making<00:02:08.170> sure<00:02:08.349> that<00:02:08.500> our

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
the other gargoyle making sure that our

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.210 
the other gargoyle making sure that our
camera<00:02:09.280> is<00:02:10.230> still<00:02:11.230> on<00:02:11.500> the<00:02:11.680> gargoyle<00:02:12.040> so<00:02:12.129> that

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
camera is still on the gargoyle so that

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:13.470 
camera is still on the gargoyle so that
would<00:02:12.310> be<00:02:12.400> grapple<00:02:12.879> to<00:02:13.000> it<00:02:13.120> and<00:02:13.269> use<00:02:13.360> the

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
would be grapple to it and use the

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.860 
would be grapple to it and use the
grapnel<00:02:13.690> accelerator<00:02:14.610> to<00:02:15.610> get<00:02:15.879> the<00:02:16.120> maximum

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870 
grapnel accelerator to get the maximum

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.930 
grapnel accelerator to get the maximum
amount<00:02:16.930> of<00:02:17.080> altitude<00:02:17.560> we<00:02:17.680> can<00:02:17.830> get<00:02:18.040> and<00:02:18.250> then

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:18.940 
amount of altitude we can get and then

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:20.759 
amount of altitude we can get and then
do<00:02:19.060> a<00:02:19.090> little<00:02:19.330> nosedive<00:02:19.900> so<00:02:20.380> they<00:02:20.470> can<00:02:20.620> get<00:02:20.739> a

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:20.769 
do a little nosedive so they can get a

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:23.100 
do a little nosedive so they can get a
little<00:02:20.950> more<00:02:21.130> altitude<00:02:21.640> and<00:02:21.900> glide<00:02:22.900> right

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
little more altitude and glide right

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.589 
little more altitude and glide right
into<00:02:23.410> the<00:02:23.560> glide<00:02:24.040> right<00:02:24.190> into<00:02:24.489> that<00:02:24.610> platform

00:02:25.589 --> 00:02:25.599 
into the glide right into that platform

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:27.600 
into the glide right into that platform
where<00:02:25.750> the<00:02:25.840> data<00:02:26.019> pack<00:02:26.260> is<00:02:26.920> well<00:02:27.250> I've<00:02:27.400> already

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610 
where the data pack is well I've already

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:31.140 
where the data pack is well I've already
got<00:02:27.730> it<00:02:27.760> so<00:02:28.000> it's<00:02:28.030> not<00:02:28.180> there<00:02:28.299> anymore<00:02:30.090> now<00:02:31.090> do

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
got it so it's not there anymore now do

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.780 
got it so it's not there anymore now do
the<00:02:31.450> nosedive

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:34.790 

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:40.270 

all<00:02:35.060> right<00:02:35.299> here<00:02:35.599> we<00:02:35.659> go<00:02:37.480> first<00:02:38.480> try<00:02:38.900> got<00:02:39.799> it
