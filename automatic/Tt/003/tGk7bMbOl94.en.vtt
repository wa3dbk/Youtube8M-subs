galaxy<00:01:58.590> s4<00:01:58.890> for<00:01:59.280> gaming<00:01:59.700> I'm<00:01:59.880> definitely

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:00.330 
galaxy s4 for gaming I'm definitely

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.809 
galaxy s4 for gaming I'm definitely
thinking<00:02:00.690> the<00:02:00.840> galaxy<00:02:01.319> s4<00:02:01.649> is<00:02:01.830> is<00:02:01.979> so<00:02:02.640> much

00:02:02.809 --> 00:02:02.819 
thinking the galaxy s4 is is so much

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:04.999 
thinking the galaxy s4 is is so much
better<00:02:03.060> and<00:02:03.959> I'm<00:02:04.289> not<00:02:04.439> even<00:02:04.649> talking<00:02:04.860> about

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
better and I'm not even talking about

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:06.770 
better and I'm not even talking about
because<00:02:05.520> it<00:02:05.670> has<00:02:05.789> a<00:02:05.819> 5-inch<00:02:06.299> display

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:06.780 
because it has a 5-inch display

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:08.870 
because it has a 5-inch display
yeah<00:02:06.959> the<00:02:07.500> 5-inch<00:02:07.740> display<00:02:08.039> definitely<00:02:08.700> makes

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:08.880 
yeah the 5-inch display definitely makes

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:11.089 
yeah the 5-inch display definitely makes
a<00:02:09.000> difference<00:02:09.349> let's<00:02:10.349> check<00:02:10.560> out<00:02:10.709> how<00:02:10.920> it

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
a difference let's check out how it

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:14.780 
a difference let's check out how it
looks<00:02:13.069> well<00:02:14.069> it<00:02:14.130> looks<00:02:14.310> like<00:02:14.400> it's<00:02:14.610> gonna<00:02:14.730> be

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:14.790 
looks well it looks like it's gonna be

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:17.090 
looks well it looks like it's gonna be
the<00:02:15.030> same<00:02:15.269> there's<00:02:16.140> nothing<00:02:16.500> really<00:02:16.650> taken

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
the same there's nothing really taken

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.210 
the same there's nothing really taken
away<00:02:17.340> from<00:02:17.400> the<00:02:17.730> displays<00:02:18.980> action<00:02:19.980> looks

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:20.220 
away from the displays action looks

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.539 
away from the displays action looks
pretty<00:02:20.489> much<00:02:20.700> exact<00:02:21.239> I<00:02:21.920> mean<00:02:22.920> obviously<00:02:23.100> the

00:02:23.539 --> 00:02:23.549 
pretty much exact I mean obviously the

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:26.080 
pretty much exact I mean obviously the
maps<00:02:23.730> are<00:02:23.910> gonna<00:02:24.000> be<00:02:24.150> different<00:02:24.359> inside<00:02:24.870> this

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
maps are gonna be different inside this

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.580 
maps are gonna be different inside this
but<00:02:27.090> we<00:02:27.209> both<00:02:27.420> die<00:02:27.660> at<00:02:27.810> the<00:02:27.900> same<00:02:28.079> time<00:02:28.350> that's

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
but we both die at the same time that's

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:39.339 
but we both die at the same time that's
pretty<00:02:29.070> cool

00:02:39.339 --> 00:02:39.349 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:42.440 

it<00:02:40.349> is<00:02:40.530> definitely<00:02:40.950> easy<00:02:41.160> to<00:02:41.430> see<00:02:41.640> the<00:02:42.209> bigger

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
it is definitely easy to see the bigger

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.510 
it is definitely easy to see the bigger
display<00:02:42.900> looks<00:02:43.170> so<00:02:43.380> much<00:02:43.530> better<00:02:43.770> for<00:02:44.040> gaming

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:44.520 
display looks so much better for gaming

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:48.130 
display looks so much better for gaming
I<00:02:44.760> mean<00:02:45.300> you<00:02:45.390> can<00:02:45.510> see<00:02:45.720> that<00:02:45.930> it's<00:02:46.050> even<00:02:46.170> wider

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:48.140 
I mean you can see that it's even wider

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:50.510 
I mean you can see that it's even wider
it<00:02:49.140> really<00:02:49.500> makes<00:02:49.680> a<00:02:49.800> big<00:02:49.830> difference

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:50.520
