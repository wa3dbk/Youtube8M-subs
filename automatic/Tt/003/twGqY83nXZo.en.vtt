00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.320 
doing a video to show you my Rhys cape
I'm<00:00:05.730> actually<00:00:05.940> decided<00:00:06.540> to<00:00:06.569> remove<00:00:07.379> the<00:00:08.330> moss

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:09.330 
I'm actually decided to remove the moss

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:10.970 
I'm actually decided to remove the moss
rock<00:00:09.660> that<00:00:09.900> I<00:00:09.929> had<00:00:10.110> right<00:00:10.290> in<00:00:10.410> the<00:00:10.500> middle<00:00:10.679> here

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:10.980 
rock that I had right in the middle here

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.530 
rock that I had right in the middle here
and<00:00:11.130> because<00:00:11.580> the<00:00:11.700> moss<00:00:11.910> was<00:00:11.940> just<00:00:12.300> getting

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
and because the moss was just getting

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:13.700 
and because the moss was just getting
way<00:00:12.990> out<00:00:13.139> of<00:00:13.230> control

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
way out of control

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.129 
way out of control
and<00:00:13.980> I<00:00:14.519> did<00:00:14.790> actually<00:00:15.059> trim<00:00:15.269> it<00:00:15.389> first<00:00:15.630> but<00:00:15.960> it

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
and I did actually trim it first but it

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.349 
and I did actually trim it first but it
didn't<00:00:16.500> really<00:00:16.560> look<00:00:16.680> the<00:00:16.920> greatest<00:00:17.330> so<00:00:18.330> I

00:00:18.349 --> 00:00:18.359 
didn't really look the greatest so I

00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.090 
didn't really look the greatest so I
decided<00:00:18.750> to<00:00:18.900> pretty<00:00:19.439> much<00:00:19.590> just<00:00:19.650> sort<00:00:20.070> of

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:20.100 
decided to pretty much just sort of

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.390 
decided to pretty much just sort of
Rescate<00:00:20.580> my<00:00:20.699> tank<00:00:20.910> a<00:00:21.000> little<00:00:21.090> bit<00:00:21.800> the<00:00:22.800> door

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
Rescate my tank a little bit the door

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.890 
Rescate my tank a little bit the door
for<00:00:23.670> us<00:00:23.820> as<00:00:23.970> you<00:00:24.000> can<00:00:24.119> see<00:00:24.359> has<00:00:24.480> been<00:00:24.630> trimmed

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:24.900 
for us as you can see has been trimmed

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.779 
for us as you can see has been trimmed
right<00:00:25.199> down<00:00:25.439> it<00:00:25.920> actually<00:00:26.039> had<00:00:26.279> a<00:00:26.310> lot<00:00:26.609> of

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
right down it actually had a lot of

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:30.080 
right down it actually had a lot of
algae<00:00:27.539> in<00:00:27.570> between<00:00:27.960> it<00:00:28.109> and<00:00:28.279> the<00:00:29.279> only<00:00:29.490> thing<00:00:30.000> I

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
algae in between it and the only thing I

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.550 
algae in between it and the only thing I
could<00:00:30.210> think<00:00:30.269> of<00:00:30.510> doing<00:00:30.630> with<00:00:30.990> it<00:00:31.140> was<00:00:31.260> just

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
could think of doing with it was just

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.260 
could think of doing with it was just
trimming<00:00:31.830> it<00:00:31.980> right<00:00:32.189> down<00:00:32.399> to<00:00:32.669> the<00:00:32.880> substrate

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
trimming it right down to the substrate

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.510 
trimming it right down to the substrate
so<00:00:33.630> got<00:00:34.440> that<00:00:34.620> trim<00:00:34.829> right<00:00:35.010> down<00:00:35.160> hopefully

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
so got that trim right down hopefully

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.540 
so got that trim right down hopefully
it'll<00:00:35.640> regrow<00:00:36.000> without<00:00:36.329> too<00:00:36.540> much<00:00:36.690> RV<00:00:37.550> apart

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
it'll regrow without too much RV apart

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.000 
it'll regrow without too much RV apart
from<00:00:38.730> that<00:00:38.910> I've<00:00:39.180> got<00:00:39.540> some<00:00:39.899> java<00:00:40.410> fern<00:00:40.680> here

some new fish in here so I've got six of

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:28.010 
some new fish in here so I've got six of

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
the moment they usually hide within the

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.520 
the moment they usually hide within the
bowel<00:01:34.140> and<00:01:34.970> it<00:01:35.970> just<00:01:36.150> been<00:01:36.299> amongst<00:01:37.170> all<00:01:37.409> the

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:37.530 
bowel and it just been amongst all the

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:39.710 
bowel and it just been amongst all the
other<00:01:37.650> plants<00:01:38.210> you<00:01:39.210> know<00:01:39.299> obvious<00:01:39.509> I've<00:01:39.600> got

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170 
growing there's so much of it but

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:03.570 
growing there's so much of it but
a<00:02:02.200> little<00:02:02.470> bit<00:02:02.590> messy<00:02:02.920> with<00:02:02.950> the<00:02:03.189> tank<00:02:03.430> like

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:03.580

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:06.240 
a little bit messy with the tank like
this<00:02:03.729> at<00:02:03.850> the<00:02:03.939> moment<00:02:04.710> but<00:02:05.710> anyway<00:02:06.040> that's

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
this at the moment but anyway that's

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.300 
this at the moment but anyway that's
what<00:02:06.369> the<00:02:06.460> takes<00:02:06.670> looking<00:02:07.030> like<00:02:08.099> yeah<00:02:09.099> not

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310 
what the takes looking like yeah not

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:11.370 
what the takes looking like yeah not
much<00:02:09.399> else<00:02:09.640> I<00:02:09.700> can<00:02:09.729> say<00:02:10.090> just<00:02:10.630> hoping<00:02:10.989> that<00:02:11.050> the

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
much else I can say just hoping that the

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:14.130 
much else I can say just hoping that the
door<00:02:11.860> pair<00:02:12.099> grass<00:02:12.370> it<00:02:12.520> grows<00:02:12.700> back<00:02:12.819> nicely<00:02:13.330> and

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:14.140 
door pair grass it grows back nicely and

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:15.809 
door pair grass it grows back nicely and
I'm<00:02:14.410> actually<00:02:14.500> thinking<00:02:14.680> of<00:02:14.830> getting<00:02:14.980> some<00:02:15.250> HC

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:15.819 
I'm actually thinking of getting some HC

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:18.479 
I'm actually thinking of getting some HC
as<00:02:16.090> a<00:02:16.660> carpet<00:02:17.200> instead<00:02:17.709> so<00:02:17.980> we'll<00:02:18.220> see<00:02:18.370> how

00:02:18.479 --> 00:02:18.489 
as a carpet instead so we'll see how

00:02:18.489 --> 00:02:20.190 
as a carpet instead so we'll see how
