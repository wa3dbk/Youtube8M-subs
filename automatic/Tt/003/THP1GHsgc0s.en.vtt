00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:07.700
 ... and the canceled goal from Higuaín, and the unauthorized red card for Pepe! 

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:15.800
 May I help you! Here is the clear evidence that in the semifinals of the Champions League was cheated and cheated! 

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:20.800
 Yes. Everything you say is as true as my invisible typewriter. 

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:22.200
 I write everything down immediately. 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.900
 But but... 

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:36.700
 Good day, your honor. 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:45.100
 I'm here to file a constitutional complaint to end the Wembley finale. 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.000
 Time will not be enough for that. The finale is in 20 days, and we have our own rhythm here 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.300
 But could not you end the reign of Barça in UEFA? 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.800
 Thats is quite easy. Prune the powers. 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:57.700
 As with the Catalan Statute of Autonomy. 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.000
 Ladies and Gentlemen of the UN 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.300
 In world football it stinks of sulfur ... 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.400
 Yes, after sulfur! 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.600
 And the person in charge is ... 

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:17.000
 "Mr. Dangerrr" ... Mr. Danger Platini! 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.000
 Because he is for Barça 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:25.700
 Just like Zapatero, and like Sarkozy, and Obama, and Bin Laden, and Heidi's grandmother, and Fred Fire ... 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.600
 (In Argentine Spanish) Human, Florentino! What are you doing here? 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:41.700
 O Lord, O Lord, I am here to implore you for divine justice so that Real Madrid regains the European Cup, as it used to. 

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.200
 But what are you talking about? 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.700
 Real Madrid plays Rumpelfootball, did not you see that? 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.100
 With Mourinho you messed everything up! 

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:54.400
 But who really plays great, are the guys from Barcelona ... 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:59.000
 Did you see that, with Messi, Xavi, Iniesta ... Wonderful! Wonderful! Did you see that? 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.000
 But you are God! You have to be for Real Madrid! 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:13.200
 My god, my god, why did you leave me? 

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:21.600
 Oh grandmaster Yoda! You who are a wise man tell me that there is a hunt against Real Madrid. 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:27.400
 The game winning a mission was impossible, huh? Bought the referee was, huh? 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.700
 World conspiracy obviously exists. 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.800
 Thank you. Finally, someone is right. Finally! 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.500
 Tell me ... Does this crazy man know that this is a booth at a comic fair? 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.700
 Let the fool in the mistaken beliefs you can 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:47.700
 Eat a bite to go? 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:50.000
 OK. Tell me, how do you manage to talk that weird? 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.200
 The slightest idea not ...
