seventh

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:46.960 

so<00:02:45.500> it's<00:02:45.709> a<00:02:45.799> very<00:02:46.040> interesting<00:02:46.189> little<00:02:46.640> turn

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:46.970 
so it's a very interesting little turn

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:48.520 
so it's a very interesting little turn
like<00:02:47.269> that<00:02:47.480> so<00:02:47.659> I'll<00:02:47.750> just<00:02:47.930> do<00:02:48.080> that<00:02:48.230> again<00:02:48.500> for

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
like that so I'll just do that again for

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:49.059 
like that so I'll just do that again for
you

00:02:49.059 --> 00:02:49.069 
you

00:02:49.069 --> 00:03:01.539 
you
that's<00:02:49.489> a<00:02:50.450> diminished<00:02:57.489> seventh<00:02:59.709> okay<00:03:00.709> so<00:03:00.769> if<00:03:01.430> I

00:03:01.539 --> 00:03:01.549 
that's a diminished seventh okay so if I

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:04.420 
that's a diminished seventh okay so if I
if<00:03:01.700> I<00:03:01.790> do<00:03:01.849> it<00:03:02.090> more<00:03:02.269> in<00:03:02.810> tempo<00:03:03.379> that<00:03:03.769> the<00:03:04.159> city

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
if I do it more in tempo that the city

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:06.399 
if I do it more in tempo that the city
you<00:03:04.790> can't<00:03:05.090> get<00:03:05.329> the<00:03:05.480> sound<00:03:05.659> of<00:03:05.870> the<00:03:05.959> sequence

00:03:06.399 --> 00:03:06.409 
you can't get the sound of the sequence

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:08.860 
you can't get the sound of the sequence
if<00:03:06.920> you<00:03:07.069> do<00:03:07.250> them<00:03:07.400> too<00:03:07.579> slowly<00:03:07.940> and<00:03:08.239> so<00:03:08.659> this<00:03:08.780> is

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:08.870 
if you do them too slowly and so this is

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:10.149 
if you do them too slowly and so this is
what<00:03:09.019> I'm<00:03:09.110> going<00:03:09.230> to<00:03:09.319> practice<00:03:09.680> them<00:03:09.860> up<00:03:09.980> and

00:03:10.149 --> 00:03:10.159 
what I'm going to practice them up and

00:03:10.159 --> 00:03:12.160 
what I'm going to practice them up and
so<00:03:10.700> then<00:03:10.970> you<00:03:11.090> get<00:03:11.209> you<00:03:11.420> get<00:03:11.569> the<00:03:11.629> sound<00:03:11.900> of<00:03:12.049> the

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.170 
so then you get you get the sound of the

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:21.160 
so then you get you get the sound of the
whole<00:03:12.349> theme<00:03:12.620> so<00:03:12.890> it's<00:03:12.920> um<00:03:13.310> it<00:03:13.760> goes<00:03:19.810> and<00:03:20.810> then

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:21.170 
whole theme so it's um it goes and then

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:27.699 
whole theme so it's um it goes and then
you<00:03:21.349> go<00:03:21.530> back<00:03:21.799> into<00:03:21.829> the

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:27.709 

00:03:27.709 --> 00:03:31.089 

and<00:03:28.219> so<00:03:28.489> it<00:03:28.790> goes<00:03:29.030> on<00:03:29.659> so<00:03:30.349> let's<00:03:30.560> now<00:03:30.769> have<00:03:31.040> a

00:03:31.089 --> 00:03:31.099 
and so it goes on so let's now have a

00:03:31.099 --> 00:03:33.459 
and so it goes on so let's now have a
