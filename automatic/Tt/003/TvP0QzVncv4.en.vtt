00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.020
 Hello dear friends with you again 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.480
 kriga tv and today i would like to talk 

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:40.620
 with you a little bit about such a machine as 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:42.630
 chiften mk5 or mark 5 and by the way should 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:46.140
 remember to remember right away that mk 

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:48.420
 this is not a modification this is mark 5 and this is not 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.000
 indicates that it is 5 modification exactly 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:52.559
 title so going back to the fight itself 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.809
 I want to say that there will not be 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:57.000
 happy ending as they say because as 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.610
 I already told you I will show everything where 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.019
 opened the car or even a fight for 

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:02.550
 I wanted to show you my own 

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:04.949
 I will show the main thing that he was to you 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.960
 interesting I think this fight will be you 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:09.210
 interesting because this rubric is the first 

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.310
 the fight and although the fight here was not the first but 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.990
 second car anyway stock because 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.020
 what to pump out and and not even two and not three 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.150
 fight and much more and honestly i 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.580
 it already kinda pumped a little but everything 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.710
 still not completely but here in this 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.840
 The situation in this battle is completely 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:27.960
 Stock car is my second fight on it 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:30.030
 so look and enjoy we got into 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.909
 top and of course when we are in the top 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.619
 best deal damage and see 

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.450
 you can bet 

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:38.640
 how much damage will be at the end of the battle 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.640
 inflicted as I can at all myself in 

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:43.799
 this fight to show and we meanwhile 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:46.649
 talk a little bit about the car itself 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:48.240
 open it after t-64 it opens 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.579
 together with t-72 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.619
 but since I thought that 70 deuce is already and 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:54.329
 themselves are all likely to pumped out yes 

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:57.030
 In general, the machine is known for it already 

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:59.159
 There are guides for sure, then I decided to take chiften 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:01.799
 and by the way did not lose because 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.899
 clean not much liked it 

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:06.270
 probably not even that he just 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:08.700
 different from 70 deuces the gameplay it 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:11.430
 really not bad and yes yes here of course 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.110
 I have bombs, I definitely took 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.930
 with bombs as I assumed that 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.819
 all sorts of die-hard 60 deuces 60 fours 

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:20.550
 it will be quite difficult to aim in the forehead 

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:23.550
 towers and not lost always take now 

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:25.650
 owl 1510 landmines on clean and honest 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:28.020
 saying they sometimes help out great 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.510
 but back again to the car itself 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:33.060
 She certainly differs from 70 twain 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.460
 firstly the most important thing of course is 

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.760
 our number of hit points can 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:41.130
 see as many as 2 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:44.250
 1066 units of strength that is, we can 

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:46.950
 soak up a huge amount of damage and this 

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.080
 undoubtedly our big plus we can 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.610
 take this damage and absorb in 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:53.040
 its fatty carcass somehow and and 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:55.170
 distribute these shells hit and order 

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.210
 withstand 5 hits 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:59.460
 Well, it's certainly not the word big 

00:02:57.210 --> 00:03:01.560
 I think the damage from the same Ural three 

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:03.330
 hitting for us will not be critical 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.970
 unless of course he misses us 

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:08.100
 cumulative returning to the car 

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:10.860
 I want to note that the reservation is here 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:13.980
 also there but it is as they say 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:16.440
 not the strongest side of the tank is 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.120
 us tower armor unfortunately not yet 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.850
 installed on 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:22.740
 additional reservation of the tower she is not 

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:24.780
 say so weak of course but she 

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:27.090
 about 200 breaks through here 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:29.310
 millimeters in the forehead and good slopes 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.230
 sometimes bounce sometimes not punch but 

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:33.540
 far from a panacea against everyone 

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:36.480
 the enemy after installing the modification 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:39.630
 there will be almost 400 millimeters of armor 

00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:41.459
 and it will be real the armor which is not 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:43.440
 punch well, not at all for what 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:46.470
 circumstances and in this situation 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:48.660
 Of course, alas, we don’t say so 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:51.150
 but we can tank a tank twice anyway 

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:53.490
 well say the same about the board and stern 

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:55.920
 breaks it all over and almost always 

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:57.330
 I have seen almost no rebound to 

00:03:55.920 --> 00:04:00.360
 remember it was really some kind 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:03.330
 should happen straight luck incredible 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:05.880
 and because well board cardboard feed 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:09.270
 cardboard as for forehead enclosure here 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:11.940
 also all is not unique if the forehead of the body 

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:13.620
 the upper part at least sometimes gives bounce 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:15.989
 there is not much lamb at least 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:18.090
 the slope is good then the bottom armor plate lives 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:19.890
 In general, all that arrives there and in general 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:21.630
 no matter who shoots you well 

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:23.940
 bpm and not every time they punch 

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:25.620
 if at all they strike but honestly they 

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:27.840
 head butting with me is somehow not particularly 

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:29.970
 so they never hurry for sure 

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:31.919
 I can not say but any tanks without 

00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:34.440
 problems you there will break through and 

00:04:31.919 --> 00:04:34.710
 nothing you can do with 

00:04:34.440 --> 00:04:37.260
 by this 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:39.750
 so going back to the tank I want to note 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:42.480
 oh his weapon is a wonderful thing just 

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:45.150
 great tool here compared to 

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:47.340
 64 but I liked it right away and much 

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:48.470
 more because she's really exactly me 

00:04:47.340 --> 00:04:51.230
 somehow you forget 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:53.390
 you ride for lunch and because it 

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:55.340
 gun she's pretty accurate good 

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:58.430
 comes down and it is undoubtedly a plus 

00:04:55.340 --> 00:05:01.400
 recharge now 731 somewhere in the top 

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:03.650
 picking will be about 6 point 7 or 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:06.080
 8 tenths of a second and top 

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:08.030
 cumulative rather than bp cumulative 

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:09.830
 yourself surely will demolish on 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:12.980
 fifty two points more damage 

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:15.140
 about one-time damage will be around 360 

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:17.870
 or 80 honestly do not remember exactly 

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:20.180
 now here is a little over 300 and 

00:05:17.870 --> 00:05:22.550
 it's still pretty good at it 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:25.460
 Considering that the breakthrough is now at the stock 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:27.650
 about 270 shells on the top 300 

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:29.750
 exactly and this is a wonderful indicator and 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:32.060
 they are quite enough for any of our 

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:33.770
 opponents well, except of course fighting 

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:36.140
 when we fall with sevens or 

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:37.820
 sixes if we are in top then no 

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:40.580
 problems do not arise right now by the way 

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:42.320
 you see wonderful just fighting 

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:44.030
 Now the moment of the battle began when I 

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:45.890
 I remain alone in the city against 

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:48.110
 several opponents and generally with 

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:50.150
 I could cope with them more or less 

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:52.580
 Understandably, what the battle is headed for is 

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:54.830
 there are two cloves no miserable 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:57.440
 so lonely standing in the city I 

00:05:54.830 --> 00:05:59.090
 and already a little bit beaten but how are you 

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:00.950
 You could see for this fight well 

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:03.320
 shells and I jumped well and 

00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:05.630
 Of course, the damage I managed to inflict 

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:07.820
 further back to the gun I want 

00:06:05.630 --> 00:06:10.669
 note that we have more or less 

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:12.890
 adequate bombs is certainly not straight 

00:06:10.669 --> 00:06:16.130
 land mines of some large caliber but 

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:18.979
 and they cause damage to the forehead of the tower 64 62 and 

00:06:16.130 --> 00:06:21.440
 compote 50 units and in the case can all 

00:06:18.979 --> 00:06:24.229
 two hundred three hundred give out if you are lucky 

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:26.960
 so it is worth carrying bombs without them 

00:06:24.229 --> 00:06:28.820
 it will sometimes be difficult and you will get a little 

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:30.950
 against some heavily armored 

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:33.320
 machines to you then they are in this case and 

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:35.750
 come in handy so it’s easy 

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:37.880
 Mast hev but although sometimes they give a failure 

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:40.310
 as now we see lav 300 armor like 

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:42.140
 No, we shoot and do not get where we need 

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:43.970
 dealing 50 damage 

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:46.850
 Well, what is the first view of on 

00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:49.010
 car first fight and see the results a 

00:06:46.850 --> 00:06:49.940
 I say goodbye to you all bye bye 

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:52.600
 there was a scream gtv 

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:52.600
 see you 

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:02.110
 exactly 100
