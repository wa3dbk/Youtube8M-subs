00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:05.659
 m 

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.780
 it's a bodyboard park here on a 

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:16.050
 miles of miles we really have 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:18.580
 has four frames had really good 

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:19.539
 that's right in front of my house 

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:21.130
 are a lot of waves taking place 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:22.929
 right here at the meeting a lot of 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.220
 left drop waves and canaries have me 

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:26.439
 allowed me to surpass myself 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:29.429
 technically progress is to me 

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:29.429
 feel really confident 

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:34.910
 at the base to die this is not the most 

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:36.800
 talented but I think his success is 

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:37.550
 due to his rigor his work and his 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.540
 determination 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:43.520
 very early it was very strong that on the 

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:46.010
 highly strategic competitions very 

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.720
 physical he really pushed all the 

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.190
 high-level sliders he thought about 

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.380
 push all the other sliders that are 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.510
 the physical the mind and that made of 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:55.190
 him a champion he started the round there 

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:57.530
 worked again he became a 

00:00:55.190 --> 00:01:00.020
 first time world champion a big 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:02.210
 sadrist bodyboard name but before 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.920
 all amaury is a man engine because 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:05.420
 it is illusory to want tu 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.500
 the vertices are loved deeply 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:10.430
 the ocean extracting me said one day 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:12.050
 I said yeah ben me I love the 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:14.810
 mountain mountain will be something 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:16.400
 of incredible and and I need to see 

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:18.050
 the mountain and feel close to the 

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.369
 united mountain but the ocean 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:20.420
 it's as if every day you 

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:22.340
 look from mountain that starts to 

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:23.750
 move exists but has changed 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.930
 I still have so much left to 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:28.820
 to learn and I think he squeezes us 

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.990
 we hide so much more and 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:34.390
 I think that by discovering a little 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:37.600
 then there is swell 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:37.600
 it's enormous 

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:42.829
 roanne was not wrong there is a good 

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:46.340
 big 3 m and icing on the cake the water 

00:01:42.829 --> 00:01:49.120
 displays only 13 degrees one of the 

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:52.150
 best local champions 

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:55.500
 the canaries how twice 

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.500
 wade was nothing 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.360
 the best conditions for the 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:06.850
 bodyboarding these are the very hollow waves 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:09.640
 which makes the tricks including the 

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:12.340
 ultra radical aerial figures is 

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:14.650
 extremely impressive and without a 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.700
 perfect control falls can 

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.700
 to be very violent
