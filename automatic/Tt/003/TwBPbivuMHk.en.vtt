00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:05.930
 - Biotechnology offers us the full potential of biological processes to generate products 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:08.810
 that can contribute to improve our wellbeing and that of the planet. 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.860
 - We want to ensure that the scientific vocation that our students feel matures and that 

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.670
 acquire the necessary training and skills to work in any laboratory 

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:27.979
 of research in the field of Biotechnology. We want you to be able to find questions 

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:34.139
 that deserve to be answered and the answers to those questions, with the most modern methods. 

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.380
 - The use of computers is a very powerful tool for simulation, 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.050
 prediction of properties and use of biomolecules as lipids, 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:48.130
 carbohydrates, nucleic acids and especially proteins. 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:53.340
 - I have always been attracted by technological advances and their influence in biology and chemistry, 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:59.360
 therefore, studying Biotechnology became my goal, my dream, and today, about to graduate, 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:00.960
 I'm just as excited as when I started. 

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:08.020
 - The application of Biotechnology to the sanitary environment has allowed not only the development of new drugs 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:14.700
 but also an improvement in the systems of prevention, diagnosis and treatment of diseases. 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:19.610
 - Part of my third biotechnology course I did in France with an Erasmus stay, 

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.750
 and it has been one of the best experiences of my life, both academically and personally. 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:29.080
 - I am from Poland and I have come to study Biotechnology at the UMH. 

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:34.620
 - Half of the credits of our Degree is of a practical nature and one of the groups receives this 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:37.240
 teaching in English, which today is considered the language of science. 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:53.000
 - We have the opportunity to get in touch with the research, already in the summer of 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.860
 Second course I could do internships in the laboratory with a teacher. 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.640
 - Biotechnology brings together many disciplines and according to our interests we can apply them 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:06.040
 to fields such as medicine, industry, agriculture and livestock or the environment. 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.540
 - Microorganisms are everywhere, they can do everything and can produce 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.920
 everything: bread, wine, beer, antibiotics, insulin ... You can even teach them to extract gold. 

00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:18.540
 - Something I like about our degree is that 

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:22.930
 most of the activities are done either in the morning or in the afternoon, 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:26.350
 so that we can take advantage of the rest of the day to study or perform work. 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:32.440
 - We do all kinds of practices: laboratory, computer, visits to industries and visits 

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:37.170
 to hospitals. The best part is that they are very dynamic and help us to strengthen 

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:38.150
 the concepts that we learn with the theory.
