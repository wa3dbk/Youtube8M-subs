other than iPhone you would use this
setting<00:02:28.860> here<00:02:28.890> so<00:02:29.790> we'll<00:02:29.910> switch<00:02:30.030> that<00:02:30.300> back

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.090 
device and connection different things

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:49.670 
device and connection different things
will<00:02:48.330> light<00:02:48.540> up<00:02:48.720> here<00:02:48.930> letting<00:02:49.170> you<00:02:49.319> know<00:02:49.470> what

will light up here letting you know what

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.620 
will light up here letting you know what
type<00:02:49.920> of<00:02:50.130> functions<00:02:50.580> will<00:02:50.819> be<00:02:50.940> available<00:02:51.450> to

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
type of functions will be available to

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:52.670 
type of functions will be available to
you<00:02:51.780> while<00:02:51.930> you're<00:02:52.080> driving

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:52.680 
you while you're driving

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:56.449 
you while you're driving
so<00:02:53.610> we'll<00:02:53.700> go<00:02:53.850> back<00:02:53.880> up<00:02:54.709> next<00:02:55.709> up<00:02:55.830> is<00:02:55.950> our<00:02:56.069> AV

00:02:56.449 --> 00:02:56.459 
so we'll go back up next up is our AV

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:59.300 
so we'll go back up next up is our AV
input<00:02:57.000> and<00:02:57.209> the<00:02:57.690> AV<00:02:58.110> input<00:02:58.650> on<00:02:58.799> this<00:02:58.920> system

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
input and the AV input on this system

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.460 
input and the AV input on this system
can<00:02:59.519> be<00:02:59.549> used<00:02:59.760> as<00:02:59.970> a<00:03:00.000> camera<00:03:00.360> input<00:03:00.900> a<00:03:00.930> second

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
can be used as a camera input a second

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:04.490 
can be used as a camera input a second
camera<00:03:01.709> input<00:03:02.130> or<00:03:02.370> as<00:03:03.090> an<00:03:03.450> audio/video<00:03:04.110> input

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
camera input or as an audio/video input

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:06.590 
camera input or as an audio/video input
so<00:03:04.890> the<00:03:05.010> system<00:03:05.310> has<00:03:05.340> a<00:03:05.489> dedicated<00:03:06.030> backup

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
so the system has a dedicated backup

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:08.210 
so the system has a dedicated backup
camera<00:03:06.989> input<00:03:07.380> that<00:03:07.530> will<00:03:07.650> automatically

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220 
camera input that will automatically

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.130 
camera input that will automatically
switch<00:03:08.400> on<00:03:08.760> when<00:03:08.970> you<00:03:09.060> put<00:03:09.540> your<00:03:09.660> vehicle<00:03:10.019> in

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:10.140 
switch on when you put your vehicle in

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.470 
switch on when you put your vehicle in
Reverse<00:03:10.500> and<00:03:10.799> it<00:03:11.280> can<00:03:11.430> be<00:03:11.519> used<00:03:11.700> with<00:03:11.910> a<00:03:11.970> second

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
Reverse and it can be used with a second

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.960 
Reverse and it can be used with a second
camera<00:03:12.930> if<00:03:13.110> you<00:03:13.769> want<00:03:14.010> you<00:03:14.130> can<00:03:14.310> use<00:03:14.340> that<00:03:14.670> AV

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
camera if you want you can use that AV

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:18.830 
camera if you want you can use that AV
input<00:03:15.600> as<00:03:15.750> a<00:03:15.810> source<00:03:16.380> as<00:03:16.650> well<00:03:17.040> and<00:03:17.570> if<00:03:18.570> we<00:03:18.660> use

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:18.840 
input as a source as well and if we use

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.479 
input as a source as well and if we use
that<00:03:19.049> as<00:03:19.230> a<00:03:19.260> source<00:03:19.650> that'll<00:03:19.950> show<00:03:20.100> up<00:03:20.220> in<00:03:20.340> our
