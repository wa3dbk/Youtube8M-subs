00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:12.150
 hello all welcome to the diets of 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.250
 Carlos, what are we going to make sponge cake 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:16.170
 of chocolate for tarts, well, what 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.349
 next is that he will congratulate are 6 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.769
 eggs the separated yolks of the egg whites 

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:24.359
 100 grams of chocolate to melt 

00:00:21.769 --> 00:00:27.300
 130 grams of butter ointment 

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:30.150
 also a little of the micro 200 grams of 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:33.180
 sugar and 14 grams of yeast which is 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.880
 like an about 130 grams of flour that 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:38.880
 then we are going to make a pinch of salt 

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:41.460
 a little bit of vanilla essence and 30 

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:45.400
 grams of pure cocoa well the 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:48.150
 first step is going to be a great and maria 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.150
 nothing 

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:57.540
 and we go chocolate and then 

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.540
 we throw the butter 

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:05.030
 and we go little by little until it melts 

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.230
 Well, this is already totally 

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:13.900
 melted 

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:16.510
 Well now we take the yolks and 

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:18.560
 we click all of them and we're going to make them a 

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:20.509
 little bit 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.820
 and now with the help of some rods we are going 

00:01:20.509 --> 00:01:27.300
 let's see let's move fast and let's go 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:30.530
 adding the yolks and beat fast 

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.530
 so that they integrate well 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:40.619
 next in a large bowl we add 

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.619
 the Clares 

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:44.790
 and the sugar 

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:48.410
 and now with the help of the blender 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.410
 rods we will assemble it well 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:04.360
 below with a language of 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.610
 silicone 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:10.229
 we are going to move this a bit and go 

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:10.229
 to add chocolate 

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.150
 the safe tends to stay in the 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:22.840
 background follow with surrounding movements 

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.840
 they mix them 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.760
 well as you see this is already more or less 

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:36.120
 integrated then here I have picked up a bowl 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:38.670
 and mix the flour with a pinch of salt 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:41.100
 and cocoa and yeast that is not 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.870
 forget then let's start it and 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:45.710
 let's start it little by little and what 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.710
 let's go integrating 

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:56.159
 AHA 

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:56.159
 we will do a little and integrate 

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:09.450
 Well, the mix is â€‹â€‹already ready 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:12.300
 as you see we have put paper here in the 

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:13.890
 vegetable folding mold for later 

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:16.950
 unmold the best and now with 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:19.080
 butter let's oil the walls 

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:23.069
 of the mold 

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:26.489
 you can always throw some flour 

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:28.909
 and we make it dry well attached to the 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:28.909
 Butter 

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:38.520
 then we are going to pour the dough 

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:38.520
 of the cake in the mold 

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:47.010
 Well, we give it a few taps to 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.330
 excess and leave bubbles 

00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:51.570
 then the put in the oven 

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:54.780
 preheated to 180 degrees between 45 and 50 

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:56.880
 minutes after 40 can be opened 

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:59.280
 the oven put a chopstick and if you 

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:01.050
 it goes clean that process is done 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:04.680
 you have to do it at 40 minutes to 

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:07.080
 the 45 250 normally at 50 is already 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:08.430
 It's superfluous to remember that if you avoid 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:11.760
 baked you see that it lends a lot 

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:13.970
 up you put albal paper on top and 

00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:13.970
 is 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:23.520
 well that's the result here is 

00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:25.020
 the chocolate cake tarts 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.300
 Mata is a little bit above, but 

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.680
 good that is that for cakes it does not matter 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:31.169
 the top part because always the 

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:33.300
 We cut to make it flat good 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:35.750
 let's proceed to simulate the 

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:35.750
 Biscuit 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:48.880
 Well since the result is the 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:50.319
 chocolate cake for cakes I said 

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:52.180
 I like the recipe, you can leave me a 

00:04:50.319 --> 00:04:54.340

 any other in the comments 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:58.000
 well and later we are going to make a 

00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:59.680
 cake with this cake so if 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.759

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.830
