clear view of them and i can see they're

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:37.610 
clear view of them and i can see they're
chasing<00:00:36.660> me<00:00:36.750> the<00:00:36.930> first<00:00:37.170> guys<00:00:37.320> going<00:00:37.530> to<00:00:37.590> come

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
chasing me the first guys going to come

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:38.869 
chasing me the first guys going to come
directly<00:00:38.010> to<00:00:38.190> me<00:00:38.219> so<00:00:38.460> I'm<00:00:38.579> just<00:00:38.700> going<00:00:38.820> to

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:38.879 
directly to me so I'm just going to

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:40.100 
directly to me so I'm just going to
predict<00:00:39.210> where<00:00:39.360> he's<00:00:39.450> going<00:00:39.570> to<00:00:39.629> go<00:00:39.750> I'm

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
predict where he's going to go I'm

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.750 
predict where he's going to go I'm
predicting<00:00:40.890> where<00:00:40.980> the<00:00:41.100> second<00:00:41.430> guy<00:00:41.520> goes

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
predicting where the second guy goes

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.430 
predicting where the second guy goes
based<00:00:42.000> on<00:00:42.149> his<00:00:42.300> movement<00:00:42.719> and<00:00:42.870> all<00:00:43.200> I<00:00:43.230> had<00:00:43.410> to

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
based on his movement and all I had to

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.389 
based on his movement and all I had to
do<00:00:43.620> there<00:00:43.770> was<00:00:43.860> aiming<00:00:44.040> for<00:00:44.070> the<00:00:44.190> cover

00:00:44.389 --> 00:00:44.399 
do there was aiming for the cover

00:00:44.399 --> 00:00:45.619 
do there was aiming for the cover
because<00:00:44.520> I<00:00:44.670> knew<00:00:44.789> he<00:00:44.910> wanted<00:00:45.030> to<00:00:45.239> bounce<00:00:45.360> off

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
because I knew he wanted to bounce off

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:48.979 
because I knew he wanted to bounce off
of<00:00:45.690> it<00:00:45.930> so<00:00:46.590> here<00:00:46.829> i<00:00:46.890> have<00:00:46.950> a3<00:00:47.309> b1<00:00:47.670> they<00:00:48.210> went<00:00:48.570> to

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
of it so here i have a3 b1 they went to

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:50.660 
of it so here i have a3 b1 they went to
spawn<00:00:49.350> to<00:00:49.530> pick<00:00:49.680> off<00:00:49.829> my<00:00:50.039> teammate<00:00:50.460> I<00:00:50.489> have<00:00:50.550> a

guy's week from the splash damage after

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.500 
guy's week from the splash damage after
the<00:00:56.340> first<00:00:56.550> so<00:00:56.699> i<00:00:56.760> was<00:00:56.850> able<00:00:56.940> to<00:00:57.120> pick<00:00:57.270> them<00:00:57.390> off

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
the first so i was able to pick them off

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:58.849 
the first so i was able to pick them off
easily<00:00:57.539> and<00:00:57.899> now<00:00:58.050> i'm<00:00:58.170> just<00:00:58.289> looking<00:00:58.590> for<00:00:58.770> the

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859 
easily and now i'm just looking for the

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.979 
easily and now i'm just looking for the
third<00:00:59.129> I<00:00:59.399> think<00:01:00.090> I<00:01:00.180> see<00:01:00.420> him<00:01:00.449> right<00:01:00.840> under

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:00.989 
third I think I see him right under

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:02.720 
third I think I see him right under
there<00:01:01.260> and<00:01:01.289> a<00:01:01.770> little<00:01:01.949> bit<00:01:02.160> of<00:01:02.190> microphone

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
there and a little bit of microphone

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.700 
there and a little bit of microphone
whoring<00:01:03.120> and<00:01:03.270> I<00:01:03.750> know<00:01:03.809> he's<00:01:04.080> super<00:01:04.409> weak<00:01:04.559> and<00:01:04.680> I

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
whoring and I know he's super weak and I

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.350 
whoring and I know he's super weak and I
just<00:01:04.890> track<00:01:05.129> his<00:01:05.309> movement<00:01:05.790> if<00:01:05.909> he<00:01:06.030> stayed

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:06.360 
just track his movement if he stayed

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.469 
just track his movement if he stayed
maybe<00:01:06.720> he<00:01:07.080> would<00:01:07.710> have<00:01:07.740> been<00:01:07.860> able<00:01:07.920> to<00:01:08.479> get

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
maybe he would have been able to get

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.300 
maybe he would have been able to get
away<00:01:09.600> but<00:01:09.720> there's<00:01:10.619> another<00:01:10.950> really<00:01:11.130> easy

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
away but there's another really easy

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.760 
away but there's another really easy
clutch<00:01:11.580> so<00:01:12.330> the<00:01:12.479> next<00:01:12.630> to<00:01:12.810> run<00:01:12.930> raven<00:01:13.320> down<00:01:13.500> and

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
clutch so the next to run raven down and

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.050 
clutch so the next to run raven down and
you're<00:01:13.860> going<00:01:13.950> to<00:01:14.010> see<00:01:14.250> that<00:01:14.400> I<00:01:14.430> do<00:01:14.520> pretty

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
you're going to see that I do pretty

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:16.179 
you're going to see that I do pretty
much<00:01:15.119> the<00:01:15.240> same<00:01:15.450> thing<00:01:15.509> I've<00:01:15.810> done<00:01:15.840> in<00:01:16.080> my

00:01:16.179 --> 00:01:16.189 
much the same thing I've done in my

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:18.649 
much the same thing I've done in my
previous<00:01:17.189> video<00:01:17.400> so<00:01:17.729> once<00:01:18.090> again<00:01:18.210> I<00:01:18.360> picked

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
previous video so once again I picked

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.270 
previous video so once again I picked
off<00:01:18.780> that<00:01:18.990> guy<00:01:19.140> could<00:01:19.320> focus<00:01:19.560> on<00:01:19.770> my<00:01:19.890> teammate

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
off that guy could focus on my teammate

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.219 
off that guy could focus on my teammate
which<00:01:20.460> leads<00:01:20.670> me<00:01:20.700> to<00:01:20.790> the<00:01:20.909> two-on-one<00:01:21.210> I<00:01:21.630> waste

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
which leads me to the two-on-one I waste

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:23.749 
which leads me to the two-on-one I waste
this<00:01:22.350> last<00:01:22.650> instant<00:01:23.040> so<00:01:23.130> i<00:01:23.189> don't<00:01:23.310> get<00:01:23.460> crossed

00:01:23.749 --> 00:01:23.759 
this last instant so i don't get crossed

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.670 
this last instant so i don't get crossed
up<00:01:24.030> and<00:01:24.299> that<00:01:24.630> gives<00:01:24.810> me<00:01:24.900> a<00:01:24.990> little<00:01:25.200> window<00:01:25.619> to

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
up and that gives me a little window to

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.160 
up and that gives me a little window to
get<00:01:26.040> to<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.460> instant<00:01:26.850> truck<00:01:27.210> here<00:01:27.479> since<00:01:28.020> the

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
since I have high ground so I'm gonna be

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.069 
since I have high ground so I'm gonna be
able<00:01:41.850> to<00:01:42.000> get<00:01:42.090> off<00:01:42.180> the<00:01:42.329> first<00:01:42.540> shot<00:01:42.630> before<00:01:42.899> he

able to get off the first shot before he

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:44.749 
able to get off the first shot before he
can<00:01:43.200> even<00:01:43.259> see<00:01:43.590> me<00:01:43.740> so<00:01:43.920> it's<00:01:44.100> an<00:01:44.189> easy<00:01:44.399> kill

00:01:44.749 --> 00:01:44.759

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.999 
can even see me so it's an easy kill
same<00:01:45.600> idea<00:01:45.780> with<00:01:46.049> this<00:01:46.200> raven<00:01:46.560> down<00:01:46.710> clutch

make a mistake of throwing the instant
right<00:02:20.219> at<00:02:20.370> their<00:02:20.519> feet<00:02:20.790> but<00:02:21.260> it's<00:02:22.260> good<00:02:22.530> to

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
right at their feet but it's good to

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:24.140 
right at their feet but it's good to
practice<00:02:22.769> throwing<00:02:23.280> the<00:02:23.519> insane<00:02:23.939> right

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
practice throwing the insane right

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.580 
practice throwing the insane right
behind<00:02:24.450> your<00:02:24.689> opponent's<00:02:25.140> if<00:02:25.230> they're<00:02:25.379> really

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:25.590 
behind your opponent's if they're really

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.099 
behind your opponent's if they're really
close<00:02:25.859> to<00:02:26.040> that<00:02:26.220> way<00:02:26.370> you<00:02:26.430> don't<00:02:26.909> take<00:02:27.780> splash

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:28.109 
close to that way you don't take splash

00:02:28.109 --> 00:02:30.470 
close to that way you don't take splash
damage<00:02:28.349> so<00:02:29.340> the<00:02:29.459> first<00:02:29.609> kill<00:02:29.849> here<00:02:30.060> was<00:02:30.209> super

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
damage so the first kill here was super

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.000 
damage so the first kill here was super
easy<00:02:30.510> to<00:02:30.750> and<00:02:30.930> you<00:02:30.989> can<00:02:31.109> see<00:02:31.230> I<00:02:31.260> actually<00:02:31.650> make

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
easy to and you can see I actually make

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.220 
easy to and you can see I actually make
a<00:02:32.040> mistake<00:02:32.430> here<00:02:32.760> and<00:02:33.299> I<00:02:33.510> I'm<00:02:33.780> mantle

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230 
a mistake here and I I'm mantle

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:35.479 
a mistake here and I I'm mantle
obviously<00:02:34.650> I<00:02:34.680> didn't<00:02:34.859> want<00:02:34.980> to<00:02:35.040> mantle<00:02:35.370> and<00:02:35.459> I

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
obviously I didn't want to mantle and I

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:37.129 
obviously I didn't want to mantle and I
get<00:02:35.670> really<00:02:35.909> weak<00:02:36.180> I<00:02:36.420> was<00:02:36.659> able<00:02:36.780> to<00:02:36.930> get<00:02:37.019> in

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:37.139 
get really weak I was able to get in

00:02:37.139 --> 00:02:38.210 
get really weak I was able to get in
that<00:02:37.170> guy's<00:02:37.409> face<00:02:37.650> and<00:02:37.829> cut<00:02:37.950> down<00:02:38.099> the

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.220 
that guy's face and cut down the

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:39.979 
that guy's face and cut down the
distance<00:02:38.430> which<00:02:38.760> is<00:02:38.909> good<00:02:39.150> which<00:02:39.689> leaves<00:02:39.900> me

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:39.989 
distance which is good which leaves me

00:02:39.989 --> 00:02:43.399 
distance which is good which leaves me
with<00:02:40.170> a<00:02:40.200> 1v1<00:02:40.650> and<00:02:41.209> now<00:02:42.209> I'm<00:02:42.599> focused<00:02:43.319> on

00:02:43.399 --> 00:02:43.409 
with a 1v1 and now I'm focused on

00:02:43.409 --> 00:02:44.990 
with a 1v1 and now I'm focused on
getting<00:02:43.650> him<00:02:43.889> weak<00:02:44.099> and<00:02:44.310> pushing<00:02:44.639> his<00:02:44.760> right

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
getting him weak and pushing his right

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.520 
getting him weak and pushing his right
hand<00:02:45.239> so<00:02:45.359> you<00:02:45.389> can<00:02:45.480> see<00:02:45.689> I<00:02:45.750> get<00:02:45.900> a<00:02:45.930> shot<00:02:46.200> off<00:02:46.230> and

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
hand so you can see I get a shot off and

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.890 
hand so you can see I get a shot off and
I<00:02:46.560> push<00:02:46.859> he<00:02:47.819> actually<00:02:48.060> gets<00:02:48.329> away<00:02:48.659> which<00:02:48.870> is

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:48.900 
I push he actually gets away which is

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:52.009 
I push he actually gets away which is
fine<00:02:49.909> so<00:02:50.909> I'm<00:02:51.030> gonna<00:02:51.180> do<00:02:51.389> the<00:02:51.510> exact<00:02:51.989> same

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:34.260 
specifically torqued the insane person

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:36.530 
specifically torqued the insane person
which<00:03:34.409> was<00:03:35.370> really<00:03:35.760> good<00:03:36.030> and<00:03:36.090> you'll<00:03:36.209> see<00:03:36.389> why

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:36.540 
which was really good and you'll see why

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:38.869 
which was really good and you'll see why
later<00:03:36.870> on<00:03:37.650> and<00:03:37.919> I've<00:03:38.310> mentioned<00:03:38.609> this<00:03:38.790> before

00:03:38.869 --> 00:03:38.879 
later on and I've mentioned this before

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:41.240 
later on and I've mentioned this before
always<00:03:39.389> fire<00:03:39.720> back<00:03:40.019> if<00:03:40.229> they're<00:03:40.409> just<00:03:40.650> Lance

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
always fire back if they're just Lance

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:43.099 
always fire back if they're just Lance
rings<00:03:41.579> so<00:03:41.819> that<00:03:41.970> kind<00:03:42.239> of<00:03:42.359> softened<00:03:42.900> him<00:03:43.079> up

00:03:43.099 --> 00:03:43.109 
rings so that kind of softened him up

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:46.039 
rings so that kind of softened him up
for<00:03:43.620> when<00:03:43.739> he<00:03:43.919> came<00:03:44.459> to<00:03:44.519> push<00:03:44.819> me<00:03:45.030> and<00:03:45.209> that

00:03:46.039 --> 00:03:46.049 
for when he came to push me and that

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:47.719 
for when he came to push me and that
leaves<00:03:46.199> me<00:03:46.349> with<00:03:46.379> a<00:03:46.500> 1v1<00:03:46.859> I'm<00:03:47.220> hitting<00:03:47.639> the

00:03:47.719 --> 00:03:47.729 
leaves me with a 1v1 I'm hitting the

00:03:47.729 --> 00:03:49.219 
leaves me with a 1v1 I'm hitting the
side<00:03:47.940> here<00:03:48.180> because<00:03:48.389> the<00:03:48.479> splash<00:03:48.750> damage<00:03:48.989> of

00:03:49.219 --> 00:03:49.229 
side here because the splash damage of

00:03:49.229 --> 00:03:50.809 
side here because the splash damage of
the<00:03:49.260> torque<00:03:49.620> is<00:03:49.769> going<00:03:49.949> to<00:03:50.010> force<00:03:50.280> him<00:03:50.459> out<00:03:50.609> and

00:03:50.809 --> 00:03:50.819 
the torque is going to force him out and

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:52.819 
the torque is going to force him out and
sure<00:03:51.359> enough<00:03:51.389> it<00:03:51.629> does<00:03:51.840> i<00:03:51.989> miss<00:03:52.169> my<00:03:52.319> shot<00:03:52.590> but

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:52.829 
sure enough it does i miss my shot but

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:54.229 
sure enough it does i miss my shot but
that<00:03:52.859> allows<00:03:53.189> me<00:03:53.340> to<00:03:53.400> push<00:03:53.639> up<00:03:53.849> and<00:03:53.970> i<00:03:54.060> have

00:03:54.229 --> 00:03:54.239 
that allows me to push up and i have

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:56.420 
that allows me to push up and i have
access<00:03:54.900> to<00:03:55.049> an<00:03:55.169> instant<00:03:55.680> this<00:03:56.159> should<00:03:56.310> have

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
access to an instant this should have

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:57.920 
access to an instant this should have
been<00:03:56.459> a<00:03:56.549> really<00:03:56.819> easy<00:03:57.060> finish<00:03:57.419> here<00:03:57.689> i'll<00:03:57.780> have

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:57.930 
been a really easy finish here i'll have

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:59.899 
been a really easy finish here i'll have
to<00:03:58.019> do<00:03:58.109> is<00:03:58.199> instant<00:03:58.590> hit<00:03:58.709> but<00:03:59.159> he<00:03:59.280> surprised<00:03:59.760> me

a good dodge on with the ink on my part
I<00:04:20.829> guess<00:04:21.010> I<00:04:21.250> need<00:04:21.880> to<00:04:22.300> make<00:04:22.480> sure<00:04:22.540> these

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:22.780 
I guess I need to make sure these

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:24.150 
I guess I need to make sure these
instance<00:04:23.140> don't<00:04:23.290> go<00:04:23.380> to<00:04:23.470> waste<00:04:23.620> or<00:04:23.800> I'm<00:04:23.860> done

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:24.160 
instance don't go to waste or I'm done

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.160 
instance don't go to waste or I'm done
so<00:04:24.430> I<00:04:24.460> got<00:04:24.820> a<00:04:24.850> little<00:04:25.000> too<00:04:25.240> close<00:04:25.510> so<00:04:25.720> I<00:04:25.780> just<00:04:26.020> I

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:26.170 
so I got a little too close so I just I

00:04:26.170 --> 00:04:29.010 
so I got a little too close so I just I
backed<00:04:26.560> off<00:04:26.770> a<00:04:26.830> bit<00:04:26.980> and<00:04:27.450> in<00:04:28.450> situations<00:04:28.960> like

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:29.020 
backed off a bit and in situations like

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:30.780 
backed off a bit and in situations like
these<00:04:29.230> i<00:04:29.290> cut<00:04:29.590> down<00:04:29.740> space<00:04:30.100> as<00:04:30.280> much<00:04:30.490> as<00:04:30.640> i<00:04:30.730> can

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:30.790 
these i cut down space as much as i can

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:33.330 
these i cut down space as much as i can
