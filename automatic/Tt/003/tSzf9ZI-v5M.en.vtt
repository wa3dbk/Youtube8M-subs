00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:30.800 
on this vehicle oh this is a great

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.279 
on this vehicle oh this is a great
example<00:00:31.520> of<00:00:31.670> what<00:00:31.910> GM's<00:00:32.390> capable<00:00:32.870> of<00:00:32.989> doing

00:00:33.279 --> 00:00:33.289 
example of what GM's capable of doing

00:00:33.289 --> 00:00:36.009 
example of what GM's capable of doing
it's<00:00:33.829> actually<00:00:34.329> even<00:00:35.329> greater<00:00:35.600> for<00:00:35.899> us

00:00:36.009 --> 00:00:36.019 
it's actually even greater for us

00:00:36.019 --> 00:00:37.840 
it's actually even greater for us
because<00:00:36.260> it's<00:00:36.710> one<00:00:36.920> of<00:00:37.039> the<00:00:37.100> first<00:00:37.309> vehicles

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:37.850 
because it's one of the first vehicles

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:40.119 
because it's one of the first vehicles
that's<00:00:38.149> gotten<00:00:38.929> global<00:00:39.409> attention<00:00:39.920> that

00:00:40.119 --> 00:00:40.129 
that's gotten global attention that

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:41.889 
that's gotten global attention that
highlights<00:00:40.579> the<00:00:40.760> fact<00:00:40.940> that<00:00:41.089> we<00:00:41.210> do<00:00:41.390> concepts

00:00:41.889 --> 00:00:41.899 
highlights the fact that we do concepts

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:42.939 
highlights the fact that we do concepts
all<00:00:41.989> over<00:00:42.139> the<00:00:42.229> world<00:00:42.409> this<00:00:42.559> was<00:00:42.739> actually

00:00:42.939 --> 00:00:42.949 
all over the world this was actually

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:46.450 
all over the world this was actually
engineered<00:00:43.639> and<00:00:43.819> built<00:00:43.879> in<00:00:45.159> Australia<00:00:46.159> and

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:46.460 
engineered and built in Australia and

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.340 
engineered and built in Australia and
our<00:00:46.579> holding<00:00:46.850> facility<00:00:47.329> and<00:00:47.629> what's<00:00:48.170> great

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:48.350 
our holding facility and what's great

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:50.889 
our holding facility and what's great
about<00:00:48.440> it<00:00:48.799> is<00:00:49.039> it<00:00:49.309> really<00:00:49.519> a<00:00:49.729> 50th<00:00:50.269> anniversary

tribute of the 1953 FJ introduce us to

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:55.899 
tribute of the 1953 FJ introduce us to
the<00:00:54.409> vehicle<00:00:54.739> from<00:00:54.829> the<00:00:54.920> front<00:00:55.249> fascia<00:00:55.519> all

00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:55.909 
the vehicle from the front fascia all

00:00:55.909 --> 00:00:57.759 
the vehicle from the front fascia all
the<00:00:56.329> way<00:00:56.449> to<00:00:56.510> the<00:00:56.749> rear<00:00:56.959> of<00:00:56.989> the<00:00:57.139> vehicle

00:00:57.759 --> 00:00:57.769 
the way to the rear of the vehicle

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:01.689 
the way to the rear of the vehicle
okay<00:00:58.459> well<00:00:58.729> the<00:00:59.030> vehicle<00:00:59.389> is<00:00:59.629> as<00:01:00.440> you<00:01:01.339> see<00:01:01.519> it's

00:01:01.689 --> 00:01:01.699 
okay well the vehicle is as you see it's

00:01:01.699 --> 00:01:05.320 
okay well the vehicle is as you see it's
mostly<00:01:02.449> about<00:01:02.739> styling<00:01:03.739> execution<00:01:04.430> but<00:01:04.790> it's

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:05.330 
mostly about styling execution but it's

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.920 
mostly about styling execution but it's
actually<00:01:05.630> a<00:01:05.659> performance<00:01:06.290> vehicle<00:01:06.440> uses<00:01:07.369> the

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:07.930 
actually a performance vehicle uses the

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.700 
actually a performance vehicle uses the
many<00:01:08.930> of<00:01:09.080> the<00:01:09.140> parts<00:01:09.440> from<00:01:09.680> the<00:01:09.910> Holden

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:11.710 
many of the parts from the Holden

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:15.030 
many of the parts from the Holden
rear-wheel<00:01:12.710> drive<00:01:13.120> global<00:01:14.120> architecture

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:15.040 
rear-wheel drive global architecture

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:19.390 
rear-wheel drive global architecture
uses<00:01:16.040> the<00:01:16.570> engine<00:01:17.570> from<00:01:17.750> the<00:01:17.780> Corvette<00:01:18.200> and<00:01:18.440> is

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:19.400 
uses the engine from the Corvette and is

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.460 
uses the engine from the Corvette and is
actually<00:01:19.610> engineered<00:01:20.300> by<00:01:20.570> the<00:01:20.600> team<00:01:21.110> down<00:01:21.350> in

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:21.470 
actually engineered by the team down in

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.670 
actually engineered by the team down in
Australia<00:01:22.060> so<00:01:23.060> that<00:01:23.090> it<00:01:23.420> will<00:01:23.630> perform<00:01:24.020> like<00:01:24.650> a

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:24.680 
Australia so that it will perform like a

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.190 
Australia so that it will perform like a
modern<00:01:25.130> vehicle<00:01:25.550> and<00:01:26.270> I<00:01:26.390> do<00:01:26.660> love<00:01:26.960> it<00:01:27.110> of

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
modern vehicle and I do love it of

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:28.300 
modern vehicle and I do love it of
course<00:01:27.350> because<00:01:27.770> it<00:01:27.890> does<00:01:28.070> have<00:01:28.250> that

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:28.310 
course because it does have that

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.970 
course because it does have that
futuristic<00:01:29.270> yet<00:01:29.510> retro<00:01:30.170> feel<00:01:30.440> to<00:01:30.620> it<00:01:30.710> it's<00:01:30.830> got

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:30.980 
futuristic yet retro feel to it it's got

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:33.070 
futuristic yet retro feel to it it's got
lots<00:01:31.280> of<00:01:31.490> chrome<00:01:31.820> it's<00:01:32.240> reminiscent<00:01:32.690> of<00:01:32.960> a

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:33.080 
lots of chrome it's reminiscent of a

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.830 
lots of chrome it's reminiscent of a
1950's<00:01:33.920> mafia<00:01:34.370> vehicle<00:01:34.790> almost<00:01:35.150> right<00:01:35.600> and

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:35.840 
1950's mafia vehicle almost right and

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.510 
1950's mafia vehicle almost right and
again<00:01:36.200> you<00:01:36.380> mentioned<00:01:36.740> it<00:01:36.800> it's<00:01:36.950> a<00:01:37.070> tribute<00:01:37.340> to

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
again you mentioned it it's a tribute to

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.550 
again you mentioned it it's a tribute to
the<00:01:37.730> 53<00:01:38.540> FJ<00:01:39.190> that<00:01:40.190> was<00:01:40.400> done<00:01:40.640> in<00:01:40.820> Holden<00:01:41.210> and

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:41.560 
the 53 FJ that was done in Holden and

the enthusiasm and passion around the
engineering<00:01:44.720> team<00:01:44.900> in<00:01:45.050> Australia<00:01:45.370> they

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:46.370 
engineering team in Australia they

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:48.340 
engineering team in Australia they
wanted<00:01:46.670> to<00:01:46.760> do<00:01:46.909> something<00:01:47.210> that<00:01:47.390> was<00:01:47.750> modern

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350 
wanted to do something that was modern

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.410 
wanted to do something that was modern
