00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 
the one that pretty much revealed that

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.990 
the one that pretty much revealed that
he<00:00:48.809> was<00:00:48.930> at<00:00:49.050> Norma<00:00:49.410> and<00:00:49.620> using<00:00:50.309> Silvia<00:00:50.730> to<00:00:50.879> do

he was at Norma and using Silvia to do

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.540

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
that was very sad as well but obviously

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:02.200 
that was very sad as well but obviously
this<00:00:58.770> is<00:00:58.829> all<00:00:59.660> due<00:01:00.660> to<00:01:00.690> the<00:01:01.170> hatred<00:01:01.440> that

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:02.210 
this is all due to the hatred that

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.910 
this is all due to the hatred that
spawns<00:01:03.210> from<00:01:03.510> being<00:01:03.809> a<00:01:03.989> normal<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.530> hatred

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:04.920
