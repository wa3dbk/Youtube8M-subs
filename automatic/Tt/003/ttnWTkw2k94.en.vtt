one<00:05:07.800> of<00:05:07.830> our<00:05:08.009> biscuits<00:05:09.289> and<00:05:10.289> there's<00:05:10.589> another

00:05:11.469 --> 00:05:11.479 
one of our biscuits and there's another

00:05:11.479 --> 00:05:13.939 
one of our biscuits and there's another
and<00:05:12.479> we<00:05:12.689> have<00:05:12.870> a<00:05:12.899> little<00:05:13.169> bit<00:05:13.379> spillage<00:05:13.770> but

and we have a little bit spillage but

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:18.709 
and we have a little bit spillage but
that's<00:05:14.129> because<00:05:14.539> your<00:05:15.539> pan<00:05:16.849> ain't<00:05:17.849> flat<00:05:18.360> or

00:05:18.709 --> 00:05:18.719 
that's because your pan ain't flat or

00:05:18.719 --> 00:05:21.709 
that's because your pan ain't flat or
perfectly<00:05:19.620> flat<00:05:19.969> so<00:05:20.969> you<00:05:21.029> know<00:05:21.330> it's<00:05:21.539> tough

00:05:21.709 --> 00:05:21.719 
perfectly flat so you know it's tough

00:05:21.719 --> 00:05:25.809 
perfectly flat so you know it's tough
leans<00:05:22.020> in<00:05:22.319> it<00:05:23.029> rains<00:05:24.029> a<00:05:24.180> little<00:05:24.419> sideways

00:05:25.809 --> 00:05:25.819
