I<00:00:42.210> need<00:00:42.270> a<00:00:42.480> bowl<00:00:45.739> guess<00:00:46.739> it<00:00:46.950> okay<00:00:47.309> there's<00:00:47.550> a

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
I need a bowl guess it okay there's a

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:53.029 
I need a bowl guess it okay there's a
pan<00:00:48.050> so<00:00:49.050> I'm<00:00:49.110> gonna<00:00:49.460> get<00:00:50.460> pan<00:00:51.440> okay<00:00:52.469> so<00:00:52.770> there's

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:08.710 

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:12.480 

I<00:01:09.869> think<00:01:10.869> that<00:01:11.110> needs<00:01:11.290> something<00:01:11.799> like<00:01:11.979> on<00:01:12.280> it

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:12.490 
I think that needs something like on it

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:15.090 
I think that needs something like on it
I<00:01:12.700> think<00:01:13.210> okay<00:01:14.080> so<00:01:14.140> in<00:01:14.380> spongebob

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.100 
I think okay so in spongebob

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.520 
I think okay so in spongebob
I<00:01:15.130> always<00:01:15.369> watch<00:01:15.700> them<00:01:16.000> make<00:01:16.720> Krabby<00:01:17.080> Patties

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:17.530 
I always watch them make Krabby Patties

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.280 
I always watch them make Krabby Patties
and<00:01:17.680> stuff<00:01:17.920> it's<00:01:18.100> harder<00:01:18.369> sauce<00:01:18.750> so<00:01:19.750> I'm<00:01:20.140> gonna

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:20.290 
and stuff it's harder sauce so I'm gonna

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:22.260

put<00:01:20.560> the<00:01:20.680> tartar<00:01:20.950> sauce<00:01:20.979> on<00:01:21.430> this<00:01:21.640> because<00:01:21.850> I

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:22.270 
put the tartar sauce on this because I

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:25.469
