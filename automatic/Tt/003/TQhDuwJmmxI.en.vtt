00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:16.420 
make sure it's right to the center line

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:21.989 
make sure it's right to the center line
that<00:01:16.990> can<00:01:17.200> get<00:01:17.399> annoying<00:01:19.770> okay<00:01:20.770> so<00:01:21.280> now<00:01:21.939> you

like<00:01:27.789> this<00:01:28.829> folding<00:01:29.829> the<00:01:30.039> edge<00:01:30.609> to<00:01:31.119> the<00:01:31.149> center

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:31.299 
like this folding the edge to the center

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:34.529 
like this folding the edge to the center
line<00:01:31.840> again<00:01:32.109> which<00:01:32.319> will<00:01:32.529> make<00:01:32.709> it<00:01:33.270> what<00:01:34.270> will

00:01:34.529 --> 00:01:34.539 
line again which will make it what will

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:37.050 
line again which will make it what will
make<00:01:34.689> the<00:01:34.869> stem<00:01:35.109> leafy<00:01:35.709> because<00:01:36.310> the<00:01:36.459> stem

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:37.060 
make the stem leafy because the stem

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.730 
make the stem leafy because the stem
does<00:01:37.329> come<00:01:37.630> with<00:01:37.749> a<00:01:37.929> leaf<00:01:39.749> okay<00:01:40.749> and<00:01:41.319> on<00:01:41.619> the

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
does come with a leaf okay and on the

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.309 
does come with a leaf okay and on the
other<00:01:41.829> side<00:01:41.979> and<00:01:42.520> you've<00:01:42.670> got<00:01:42.909> this<00:01:43.119> okay<00:01:43.959> uh

00:01:44.309 --> 00:01:44.319 
other side and you've got this okay uh

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:47.459 
other side and you've got this okay uh
on<00:01:44.920> the<00:01:45.009> top<00:01:45.219> it's<00:01:45.490> white<00:01:45.810> fold<00:01:46.810> that<00:01:47.049> to<00:01:47.319> the

00:01:47.459 --> 00:01:47.469 
on the top it's white fold that to the

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:57.569 
on the top it's white fold that to the
center<00:01:47.950> like<00:01:48.459> so<00:01:50.880> just<00:01:51.880> the<00:01:52.569> top<00:01:53.549> edge<00:01:56.579> like

00:01:57.569 --> 00:01:57.579 
center like so just the top edge like

00:01:57.579 --> 00:01:58.710 
center like so just the top edge like
that

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:58.720 
that

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.380 
that
so<00:01:59.200> it<00:01:59.290> looks<00:01:59.470> like<00:01:59.560> that<00:01:59.860> and<00:02:00.820> do<00:02:01.090> it<00:02:01.180> again<00:02:01.300> on

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:01.390 
so it looks like that and do it again on

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:09.510 
so it looks like that and do it again on
the<00:02:01.480> other<00:02:01.510> side<00:02:07.470> great<00:02:08.470> so<00:02:08.979> now<00:02:09.220> you've<00:02:09.369> got

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:09.520 
the other side great so now you've got

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:15.600 
the other side great so now you've got
this<00:02:10.590> really<00:02:11.590> nice<00:02:11.830> okay<00:02:12.310> so<00:02:13.140> take<00:02:14.140> a<00:02:14.620> go<00:02:15.430> like

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:15.610 
this really nice okay so take a go like

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.030 
this really nice okay so take a go like
that<00:02:15.850> flip<00:02:16.120> it<00:02:16.240> over<00:02:16.330> so<00:02:16.900> this<00:02:17.230> side<00:02:17.530> is<00:02:17.830> facing

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
that flip it over so this side is facing

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:22.860 
that flip it over so this side is facing
you<00:02:18.250> and<00:02:19.650> point<00:02:20.650> this<00:02:21.220> edge<00:02:21.520> about<00:02:22.210> two-thirds

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
you and point this edge about two-thirds

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:27.510 
you and point this edge about two-thirds
of<00:02:23.050> the<00:02:23.110> way<00:02:23.200> up<00:02:23.530> to<00:02:24.340> the<00:02:24.670> top<00:02:25.030> so<00:02:25.950> but<00:02:26.950> if

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:27.520 
of the way up to the top so but if

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.100 
of the way up to the top so but if
you're<00:02:27.730> using<00:02:27.880> a<00:02:28.060> normal<00:02:28.390> sized<00:02:28.600> piece<00:02:28.960> of

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:29.110 
you're using a normal sized piece of

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.440 
you're using a normal sized piece of
origami<00:02:29.290> paper<00:02:29.680> just<00:02:30.070> about<00:02:30.220> I<00:02:30.550> don't<00:02:31.300> know

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 
origami paper just about I don't know

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.190 
origami paper just about I don't know
but<00:02:31.630> it<00:02:31.720> you<00:02:32.110> know<00:02:32.140> yeah<00:02:33.810> you'll<00:02:34.810> have<00:02:34.990> a<00:02:35.020> bit

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:35.200 
but it you know yeah you'll have a bit

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.680 
but it you know yeah you'll have a bit
of<00:02:35.230> centimeter<00:02:35.920> to<00:02:36.520> tell<00:02:36.790> when<00:02:37.180> you've<00:02:37.420> got

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:37.690 
of centimeter to tell when you've got

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.790 
of centimeter to tell when you've got
there<00:02:37.990> so<00:02:38.290> a<00:02:38.560> boat<00:02:39.660> button<00:02:40.660> it<00:02:40.750> down<00:02:40.990> on<00:02:41.500> the

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:41.800 
there so a boat button it down on the

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:44.160 
there so a boat button it down on the
centerline<00:02:42.160> and<00:02:42.640> you'll<00:02:43.030> have<00:02:43.240> that<00:02:43.600> oh<00:02:43.840> great

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
centerline and you'll have that oh great

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:49.170 
centerline and you'll have that oh great
paste<00:02:44.650> it<00:02:44.830> there<00:02:45.600> I'm<00:02:47.850> good

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:49.180 
paste it there I'm good

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:53.030 
paste it there I'm good
well<00:02:49.750> that's<00:02:49.990> more<00:02:50.260> in<00:02:50.350> the<00:02:50.410> center<00:02:51.660> yep

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
well that's more in the center yep

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:57.810 
well that's more in the center yep
that<00:02:54.040> much<00:02:55.500> right<00:02:56.500> there<00:02:56.530> so<00:02:57.340> you've<00:02:57.490> got<00:02:57.670> that

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:57.820 
that much right there so you've got that

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:00.780 
that much right there so you've got that
it<00:02:57.970> looks<00:02:58.150> like<00:02:58.300> a<00:02:58.330> leaf<00:02:58.570> basically<00:02:59.500> okay<00:03:00.400> so

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:00.790 
it looks like a leaf basically okay so

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.860 
it looks like a leaf basically okay so
make<00:03:01.030> sure<00:03:01.060> that<00:03:01.330> this<00:03:01.750> isn't<00:03:02.050> folded<00:03:02.620> in<00:03:03.870> and

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
make sure that this isn't folded in and

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.320 
make sure that this isn't folded in and
make<00:03:05.200> sure<00:03:05.230> the<00:03:05.560> top<00:03:06.430> is<00:03:06.459> facing<00:03:07.150> on<00:03:07.239> the

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:07.330 
make sure the top is facing on the

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:11.250 
make sure the top is facing on the
center<00:03:07.690> line<00:03:07.720> and<00:03:08.489> fold<00:03:09.489> it<00:03:09.730> like<00:03:10.360> just<00:03:10.750> flip

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:11.260 
center line and fold it like just flip
