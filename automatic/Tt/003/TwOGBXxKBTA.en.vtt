00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
on the PlayStation 3 so that you

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.310 
on the PlayStation 3 so that you
actually<00:03:11.820> move<00:03:12.000> out<00:03:12.270> of<00:03:12.330> the<00:03:12.660> garage<00:03:12.810> in<00:03:13.200> your

actually move out of the garage in your
vehicle<00:03:13.680> and<00:03:13.890> as<00:03:14.130> you<00:03:14.430> were<00:03:14.550> moving<00:03:14.760> out<00:03:14.940> right

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
vehicle and as you were moving out right

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.720 
vehicle and as you were moving out right
there<00:03:15.600> you're<00:03:15.810> gonna<00:03:15.900> want<00:03:16.110> to<00:03:16.140> click<00:03:16.320> a<00:03:16.470> or<00:03:17.070> X

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
there you're gonna want to click a or X

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.150 
there you're gonna want to click a or X
on<00:03:18.120> the<00:03:18.240> PlayStation<00:03:18.720> 3<00:03:18.990> and<00:03:19.170> by<00:03:19.530> doing<00:03:20.010> that

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
on the PlayStation 3 and by doing that

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.640 
on the PlayStation 3 and by doing that
it<00:03:20.370> basically<00:03:20.850> tricks<00:03:21.390> more's<00:03:21.810> into<00:03:22.230> thinking

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:22.650 
it basically tricks more's into thinking

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.160 
it basically tricks more's into thinking
that<00:03:22.680> you<00:03:23.580> are<00:03:23.610> just<00:03:24.209> getting<00:03:24.690> back<00:03:24.959> the

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
that you are just getting back the

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:27.230 
that you are just getting back the
vehicle<00:03:25.590> that<00:03:25.770> you<00:03:26.040> initially<00:03:26.760> blew<00:03:26.940> up<00:03:27.090> but

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:27.240 
vehicle that you initially blew up but

00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:29.449 
vehicle that you initially blew up but
in<00:03:27.390> reality<00:03:27.600> it's<00:03:28.170> actually<00:03:28.860> transferring

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459 
in reality it's actually transferring

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:31.790 
in reality it's actually transferring
the<00:03:29.670> insurance<00:03:30.209> onto<00:03:30.780> the<00:03:30.870> vehicle<00:03:31.290> that<00:03:31.500> you

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:31.800 
the insurance onto the vehicle that you

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.890 
the insurance onto the vehicle that you
that<00:03:32.580> you<00:03:32.790> just<00:03:33.120> drove<00:03:33.390> out<00:03:33.600> of<00:03:33.630> the<00:03:33.750> garage

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:33.900 
that you just drove out of the garage

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:36.350 
that you just drove out of the garage
with<00:03:34.290> so<00:03:34.620> now<00:03:35.070> there<00:03:35.520> are<00:03:35.550> a<00:03:35.730> couple<00:03:35.940> more

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:36.360 
with so now there are a couple more

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:38.270 
with so now there are a couple more
steps<00:03:36.690> still<00:03:37.080> so<00:03:37.470> what<00:03:37.680> you<00:03:37.740> want<00:03:37.920> to<00:03:38.010> do<00:03:38.100> is

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
steps still so what you want to do is

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:39.500 
steps still so what you want to do is
you<00:03:38.370> want<00:03:38.520> to<00:03:38.550> bring<00:03:38.730> your<00:03:38.850> police<00:03:39.300> cruiser

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
you want to bring your police cruiser

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:40.970 
you want to bring your police cruiser
back<00:03:39.840> to<00:03:40.050> the<00:03:40.140> garage<00:03:40.260> and<00:03:40.590> you<00:03:40.650> want<00:03:40.800> to<00:03:40.890> do

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980 
back to the garage and you want to do

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:42.410 
back to the garage and you want to do
the<00:03:41.100> glitch<00:03:41.310> I<00:03:41.490> showed<00:03:41.670> at<00:03:41.820> the<00:03:41.850> beginning<00:03:42.000> of

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:42.420 
the glitch I showed at the beginning of

00:03:42.420 --> 00:03:44.330 
the glitch I showed at the beginning of
the<00:03:42.540> video<00:03:42.660> so<00:03:43.350> you<00:03:43.380> put<00:03:43.650> it<00:03:43.739> back<00:03:43.950> in<00:03:44.190> your

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
the video so you put it back in your

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.970 
the video so you put it back in your
garage<00:03:44.630> so<00:03:45.630> that's<00:03:45.930> gonna<00:03:46.140> finalize<00:03:46.709> the

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:46.980 
garage so that's gonna finalize the

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.010 
garage so that's gonna finalize the
insurance<00:03:47.459> transfer<00:03:48.030> and<00:03:48.239> once<00:03:48.510> you<00:03:48.660> do<00:03:48.810> that

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:49.020 
insurance transfer and once you do that

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:50.479 
insurance transfer and once you do that
you<00:03:49.140> actually<00:03:49.290> want<00:03:49.739> to<00:03:49.770> go<00:03:49.890> back<00:03:49.920> in

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
you actually want to go back in

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:52.910 
you actually want to go back in
whichever<00:03:51.390> vehicle<00:03:51.989> you've<00:03:52.230> done<00:03:52.470> this<00:03:52.620> with

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:52.920 
whichever vehicle you've done this with

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:54.770 
whichever vehicle you've done this with
so<00:03:53.520> obviously<00:03:54.030> I<00:03:54.090> did<00:03:54.300> it<00:03:54.390> with<00:03:54.480> the<00:03:54.570> police

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:54.780 
so obviously I did it with the police

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.150 
so obviously I did it with the police
cruiser<00:03:55.050> and<00:03:55.230> you<00:03:55.320> want<00:03:55.500> to<00:03:55.590> pull<00:03:55.739> it<00:03:55.800> out<00:03:55.980> one

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:56.160 
cruiser and you want to pull it out one

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.340 
cruiser and you want to pull it out one
more<00:03:56.280> time<00:03:56.489> and<00:03:56.760> now<00:03:56.850> you<00:03:57.420> have<00:03:57.630> to<00:03:57.780> blow<00:03:58.020> it<00:03:58.170> up

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:58.350 
more time and now you have to blow it up

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:00.410 
more time and now you have to blow it up
a<00:03:58.440> couple<00:03:58.650> times<00:03:58.770> so<00:03:59.310> pull<00:03:59.640> it<00:03:59.670> out<00:03:59.880> this<00:04:00.090> is<00:04:00.270> to

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:00.420 
a couple times so pull it out this is to

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:02.360 
a couple times so pull it out this is to
make<00:04:00.570> sure<00:04:00.600> that<00:04:00.840> no<00:04:01.230> duplications<00:04:02.070> of<00:04:02.220> the

00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:02.370 
make sure that no duplications of the

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.250 
make sure that no duplications of the
car<00:04:02.550> end<00:04:02.790> up<00:04:02.940> glitched<00:04:03.300> in<00:04:03.600> your<00:04:03.720> garage<00:04:03.930> and

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:04.260 
car end up glitched in your garage and

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:06.979 
car end up glitched in your garage and
undriveable<00:04:04.739> so<00:04:05.190> pull<00:04:05.430> it<00:04:05.459> out<00:04:05.670> once<00:04:05.970> blow<00:04:06.840> it

00:04:06.979 --> 00:04:06.989 
undriveable so pull it out once blow it

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:08.750 
undriveable so pull it out once blow it
up<00:04:07.140> like<00:04:07.470> I'm<00:04:07.650> showing<00:04:07.890> in<00:04:08.100> the<00:04:08.190> video<00:04:08.459> and

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:08.760 
up like I'm showing in the video and

00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.000 
up like I'm showing in the video and
then<00:04:09.180> quickly<00:04:09.720> lose<00:04:09.930> the<00:04:10.110> cops<00:04:10.350> at<00:04:10.709> which

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
then quickly lose the cops at which

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:12.490 
then quickly lose the cops at which
point<00:04:11.310> you're<00:04:11.459> gonna<00:04:11.610> call<00:04:11.910> your<00:04:12.090> mechanic

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:12.500 
point you're gonna call your mechanic

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:14.630 
point you're gonna call your mechanic
