00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:04.790
 two years ago everyone believed me 

00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:07.140
 dead 

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:09.590
 and resuscitate 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.059
 and the same can do queens industries 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:13.740
 with the investment of the national bank of 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:17.910
 stalin we can know the company from the 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:21.530
 suspension of payments and take it to the future 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.530
 this company is my family 

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:27.820
 and as my mother used to say it 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:30.000
 there is nothing more important than 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:32.810
 family 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.810
 Thank you 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.289
 Good speech 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.289
 it will be difficult to overcome 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:50.379
 thank you all for being here today 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.679
 I promise to be brief and also something 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:52.679
 entertaining 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:59.060
 and that's one of my watches I'm very 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.570
 proud of them 

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:05.970
 he likes it works well I'm glad but 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:08.770
 good science numbers 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:10.840
 I like numbers 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:12.399
 here they have the behavior of the 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:14.920
 company under the direction of the Lord 

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:16.869
 wing and used the term address without 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.149
 too much rigor because these figures do not 

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:20.740
 are retouched for wall street this is 

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:22.420
 your server's information 

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.850
 company as I have entered our 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.950
 computers I imagine and using a 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:29.259
 administrator on a motorcycle but the truth is 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:31.959
 that the state of the company is a 

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:35.560
 symptom of a much bigger problem and that 

00:01:31.959 --> 00:01:37.119
 problem is starlin without industries 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:39.980
 queens can not hope to survive 

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:43.100
 located in a city that is agonizing 

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:45.870
 and they know it's like that 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:48.450
 nobody wants to live here anymore 

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:50.970
 after the terrorist attacks I did not 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:54.720
 strange this city still needs 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:57.630
 be saved and that is my vision for this 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.430
 company not only see her resurface from her 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.430
 ashes but take to the city of the 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:05.540
 hand towards a new horizon and that 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:08.200
 new day has a name 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:08.200
 9 

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:17.010
 oliver 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:19.530
 I'm sorry I thought everything would come out 

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.750
 We wanted me too but the company 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.190
 will be better with doctor palmer the year 

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:25.230
 last do not devote time to the company 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.870
 wants to direct it now is very selfish is 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.520
 something that the old me would do and you're 

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.740
 last 12 hours they reminded me that 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.350
 two years ago I made the decision to leave 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:36.060
 to be oliver win to be garlic and now 

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:37.890
 I can not back out in the restaurant 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:40.530
 you did not think like that and look what happened or 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.930
 leagues the explosion was not your fault 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:45.290
 happy and of 4 gerner I inject that 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:48.990
 vertigo told me that his formula 

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:52.200
 It showed your greatest fear 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:54.840
 I wanted to myself do not you seriously think 

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.000
 you're scared I'm afraid of what 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:59.390
 would happen if I allowed myself to become a tree 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.390
 and as is
