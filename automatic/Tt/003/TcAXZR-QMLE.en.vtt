00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:21.040 
have my own signature amp Randall a

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:26.080 
have my own signature amp Randall a
special<00:00:22.040> edition<00:00:22.940> it's<00:00:23.510> um<00:00:24.610> what<00:00:25.610> it<00:00:25.700> is<00:00:25.850> is

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:26.090 
special edition it's um what it is is

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:29.920 
special edition it's um what it is is
basically<00:00:26.540> it's<00:00:27.520> these<00:00:28.520> modules<00:00:29.210> that<00:00:29.750> are

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:29.930 
basically it's these modules that are

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:33.460 
basically it's these modules that are
that<00:00:30.500> are<00:00:30.560> kind<00:00:31.100> of<00:00:31.160> programmed<00:00:31.730> to<00:00:32.470> different

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:33.470 
that are kind of programmed to different

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:36.520 
that are kind of programmed to different
sounds<00:00:34.129> to<00:00:34.280> the<00:00:34.430> that<00:00:34.820> i<00:00:34.910> use<00:00:35.180> livanon<00:00:36.020> studio

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:36.530 
sounds to the that i use livanon studio

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:40.330 
sounds to the that i use livanon studio
and<00:00:36.890> i<00:00:37.670> basically<00:00:37.970> have<00:00:38.510> a<00:00:38.750> module<00:00:39.620> for<00:00:39.920> like

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:40.340 
and i basically have a module for like

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:43.030 
and i basically have a module for like
more<00:00:40.970> clean<00:00:41.330> towns<00:00:41.750> bluesy<00:00:42.500> sounds<00:00:42.920> as<00:00:43.010> a

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:43.040 
more clean towns bluesy sounds as a

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.580 
more clean towns bluesy sounds as a
module<00:00:43.550> for<00:00:43.580> like<00:00:43.940> super<00:00:44.590> heavy-duty

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:45.590 
module for like super heavy-duty

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:48.910 
module for like super heavy-duty
distortion<00:00:46.579> game<00:00:46.940> and<00:00:47.750> heavy<00:00:47.930> metal<00:00:48.260> stop<00:00:48.530> and

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:48.920 
distortion game and heavy metal stop and

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.520 
distortion game and heavy metal stop and
then<00:00:49.100> another<00:00:49.940> module<00:00:50.270> that's<00:00:50.960> just<00:00:51.230> kind<00:00:51.470> of

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:51.530 
then another module that's just kind of

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:53.910 
then another module that's just kind of
like<00:00:51.800> yelled<00:00:52.210> land<00:00:53.210> somewhere<00:00:53.630> in<00:00:53.780> between

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:53.920 
like yelled land somewhere in between

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.350 
like yelled land somewhere in between
but<00:00:54.920> yeah<00:00:55.130> I<00:00:55.160> really<00:00:55.430> like<00:00:55.610> the<00:00:55.760> Randall<00:00:56.090> stuff

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:56.360 
but yeah I really like the Randall stuff

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.110 
but yeah I really like the Randall stuff
and<00:00:56.660> with<00:00:57.320> today's<00:00:57.440> technology<00:00:57.820> it's<00:00:58.820> really

00:00:59.110 --> 00:00:59.120 
and with today's technology it's really

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.910 
and with today's technology it's really
great<00:00:59.360> to<00:00:59.420> be<00:01:00.020> able<00:01:00.170> to<00:01:01.870> model<00:01:02.870> certain<00:01:03.260> sounds

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:03.920 
great to be able to model certain sounds

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.650 
great to be able to model certain sounds
that<00:01:04.130> I've<00:01:04.399> been<00:01:04.550> getting<00:01:04.850> out<00:01:05.000> of<00:01:05.119> a<00:01:05.210> lot<00:01:05.390> of<00:01:05.509> a

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:05.660 
that I've been getting out of a lot of a

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:09.100 
that I've been getting out of a lot of a
vintage<00:01:06.140> amps<00:01:06.710> up<00:01:06.830> and<00:01:07.040> and<00:01:07.759> modern<00:01:08.630> amps<00:01:08.930> and

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.110 
vintage amps up and and modern amps and

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.420 
vintage amps up and and modern amps and
just<00:01:09.590> having<00:01:09.830> them<00:01:09.950> all<00:01:10.340> in<00:01:10.820> one<00:01:10.880> unit<00:01:11.840> so<00:01:12.229> that

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:12.430 
just having them all in one unit so that

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:16.719 
just having them all in one unit so that
pretty<00:01:13.430> much<00:01:13.580> had<00:01:14.030> have<00:01:14.750> the<00:01:15.140> control<00:01:15.680> of<00:01:16.100> all

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:16.729 
pretty much had have the control of all

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:20.370 
pretty much had have the control of all
those<00:01:16.910> tones<00:01:17.180> underneath<00:01:17.860> my<00:01:18.880> fingertips<00:01:19.880> or

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:20.380 
those tones underneath my fingertips or

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.719 
those tones underneath my fingertips or
activated<00:01:21.380> by<00:01:21.500> a<00:01:21.530> foot<00:01:21.860> switch<00:01:22.130> or<00:01:22.340> whatever

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:22.729 
activated by a foot switch or whatever

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:26.020 
activated by a foot switch or whatever
and<00:01:23.740> it's<00:01:24.740> pretty<00:01:25.010> much<00:01:25.250> what<00:01:25.610> I've<00:01:25.820> always

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
and it's pretty much what I've always

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.810 
and it's pretty much what I've always
wanted<00:01:26.180> to<00:01:26.630> do<00:01:26.840> without<00:01:27.280> having<00:01:28.280> the<00:01:28.430> cart

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:28.820

jazzed and yeah I never thought that I'd
be<00:02:09.220> using<00:02:10.220> Randall<00:02:10.720> because<00:02:11.720> my<00:02:11.870> very<00:02:12.079> first

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
be using Randall because my very first

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.820 
be using Randall because my very first
lamp<00:02:12.650> was<00:02:12.890> a<00:02:12.920> random<00:02:13.400> basis<00:02:13.940> and<00:02:14.269> boy

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
lamp was a random basis and boy

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:18.400 
lamp was a random basis and boy
come<00:02:16.460> a<00:02:16.490> long<00:02:16.700> way<00:02:16.910> but<00:02:17.420> none<00:02:17.600> back<00:02:17.870> to<00:02:18.050> Randall

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
come a long way but none back to Randall

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:42.990 
come a long way but none back to Randall
again<00:02:19.150> at<00:02:20.150> school

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:43.000 

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.060
