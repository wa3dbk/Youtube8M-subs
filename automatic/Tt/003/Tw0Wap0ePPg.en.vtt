although some of you may have figured

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.540 
although some of you may have figured
out<00:00:17.700> where<00:00:18.149> I<00:00:18.180> rather<00:00:18.630> whimsical<00:00:19.550> reasoning

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
out where I rather whimsical reasoning

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.859 
out where I rather whimsical reasoning
for<00:00:20.700> choosing<00:00:20.970> this<00:00:21.119> particular<00:00:21.599> area

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:23.869

for choosing this particular area
gastrin<00:00:24.869> dragons<00:00:25.500> are<00:00:26.460> rather<00:00:27.090> bad<00:00:27.660> ass<00:00:27.930> and

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
gastrin dragons are rather bad ass and

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.780 
gastrin dragons are rather bad ass and
saurian<00:00:29.419> unlike<00:00:30.419> the<00:00:30.720> more<00:00:31.040> doglike<00:00:32.040> dragons

image of the Dragon just place the lines
where<00:01:18.590> you<00:01:18.740> believe<00:01:19.160> they<00:01:19.430> should<00:01:19.490> go<00:01:19.850> to<00:01:20.660> get

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 
where you believe they should go to get

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:29.010 
where you believe they should go to get
the<00:01:20.930> overall<00:01:21.440> effect<00:01:26.650> as<00:01:27.650> for<00:01:28.100> scale<00:01:28.520> design

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:29.020 
the overall effect as for scale design

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:32.020 
the overall effect as for scale design
can<00:01:30.020> be<00:01:30.050> rather<00:01:30.350> tricky<00:01:30.830> depending<00:01:31.550> on<00:01:31.700> where

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030 
can be rather tricky depending on where

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.240 
can be rather tricky depending on where
the<00:01:32.270> light<00:01:32.540> is<00:01:32.780> coming<00:01:33.200> from<00:01:34.030> in<00:01:35.030> this<00:01:35.479> case

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:36.250 
the light is coming from in this case

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.310 
the light is coming from in this case
the<00:01:37.250> Sun<00:01:37.580> is<00:01:38.030> the<00:01:38.090> main<00:01:38.420> source<00:01:38.720> of<00:01:38.900> light<00:01:39.140> of

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.320 
the Sun is the main source of light of

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:42.910 
the Sun is the main source of light of
these<00:01:39.470> outdoors<00:01:40.009> and<00:01:40.570> so<00:01:41.570> because<00:01:42.470> the<00:01:42.650> Sun<00:01:42.890> is

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:42.920 
these outdoors and so because the Sun is

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.130 
these outdoors and so because the Sun is
high<00:01:43.460> up<00:01:43.670> in<00:01:43.940> the<00:01:43.970> sky<00:01:44.150> we<00:01:44.840> have<00:01:44.960> already

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:45.140 
high up in the sky we have already

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.790 
high up in the sky we have already
determined<00:01:46.270> the<00:01:47.270> main<00:01:47.509> source<00:01:48.050> of<00:01:48.259> light<00:01:48.590> is

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:48.800 
determined the main source of light is

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.210 
determined the main source of light is
coming<00:01:49.070> from<00:01:49.220> most<00:01:49.850> directly<00:01:50.450> above<00:01:51.220> the

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:52.220 
coming from most directly above the

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:58.930 
coming from most directly above the
dragon<00:01:54.250> the<00:01:55.250> tenth<00:01:55.610> of<00:01:55.910> the<00:01:56.690> muscles<00:01:57.340> is<00:01:58.340> also

00:01:58.930 --> 00:01:58.940 
dragon the tenth of the muscles is also

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:03.010 
dragon the tenth of the muscles is also
useful<00:01:59.649> but<00:02:00.649> shouldn't<00:02:01.160> be<00:02:01.220> well<00:02:02.000> defined<00:02:02.300> on

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
useful but shouldn't be well defined on

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:11.790 
useful but shouldn't be well defined on
such<00:02:03.290> an<00:02:03.440> armored<00:02:03.830> creature

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:11.800 

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:14.230 

satisfied<00:02:12.800> the<00:02:13.070> look<00:02:13.250> at<00:02:13.370> the<00:02:13.460> right<00:02:13.670> leg<00:02:13.970> so

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:14.240 
satisfied the look at the right leg so

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:19.720 
satisfied the look at the right leg so
far<00:02:15.070> we<00:02:16.070> are<00:02:16.370> thus<00:02:16.820> able<00:02:17.120> to<00:02:18.220> bond<00:02:19.220> the<00:02:19.490> left

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:19.730 
far we are thus able to bond the left

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:26.230 
far we are thus able to bond the left
leg<00:02:20.030> and<00:02:20.950> perform<00:02:21.950> a<00:02:22.070> similar<00:02:22.400> job<00:02:22.910> on<00:02:23.180> that<00:02:25.240> is

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:26.240 
leg and perform a similar job on that is

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.280 
leg and perform a similar job on that is
important<00:02:27.050> however<00:02:27.290> to<00:02:27.470> remember<00:02:29.290> that

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:30.290 
important however to remember that

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.500 
important however to remember that
because<00:02:30.800> of<00:02:31.010> the<00:02:31.040> different<00:02:31.520> positions<00:02:31.700> of

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:32.510 
because of the different positions of

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:36.010 
because of the different positions of
the<00:02:32.570> leg<00:02:33.050> the<00:02:33.890> foot<00:02:34.420> will<00:02:35.420> be<00:02:35.630> quite<00:02:35.990> a

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:36.020 
the leg the foot will be quite a

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:43.890 
the leg the foot will be quite a
different<00:02:36.650> job<00:02:37.070> to<00:02:37.430> accomplish

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.880 

yeah<00:02:44.590> but<00:02:45.519> what<00:02:45.760> is<00:02:45.909> facing<00:02:46.569> you<00:02:47.409> are<00:02:47.650> almost

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
yeah but what is facing you are almost

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:54.000 
yeah but what is facing you are almost
head<00:02:48.340> home<00:02:49.170> and<00:02:50.170> thus<00:02:51.209> the<00:02:52.209> position<00:02:53.010> is

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:54.010 
head home and thus the position is

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:59.390 
head home and thus the position is
completely<00:02:54.849> different

00:02:59.390 --> 00:02:59.400 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.360 

procedures<00:03:00.329> however<00:03:00.810> are<00:03:00.900> similar<00:03:01.439> once<00:03:02.159> the
