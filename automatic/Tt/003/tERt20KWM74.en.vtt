00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
that pushes on the coil by changing the

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.870 
that pushes on the coil by changing the
direction<00:01:31.289> of<00:01:31.710> the<00:01:31.770> electric<00:01:32.220> current<00:01:32.520> in<00:01:32.670> the

direction of the electric current in the

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:34.820 
direction of the electric current in the
coil<00:01:33.149> we<00:01:33.509> change<00:01:33.869> the<00:01:34.140> direction<00:01:34.619> of<00:01:34.740> that

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:34.830 
coil we change the direction of that

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:38.749 
coil we change the direction of that
force<00:01:35.810> so<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:37.350> coil<00:01:37.590> is<00:01:37.800> pushed<00:01:38.100> one<00:01:38.340> way<00:01:38.520> when

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
force so the coil is pushed one way when

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.279 
force so the coil is pushed one way when
the<00:01:38.850> electric<00:01:39.210> current<00:01:39.479> circulates<00:01:39.990> in<00:01:40.140> one

00:01:40.279 --> 00:01:40.289 
the electric current circulates in one

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:42.950 
the electric current circulates in one
direction<00:01:40.470> and<00:01:40.950> the<00:01:41.789> opposite<00:01:42.330> way<00:01:42.509> when<00:01:42.869> the

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:42.960 
direction and the opposite way when the

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.760 
direction and the opposite way when the
current<00:01:43.289> changes<00:01:43.800> direction<00:01:45.380> since<00:01:46.380> the<00:01:46.530> coil

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
current changes direction since the coil

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.980 
current changes direction since the coil
is<00:01:46.950> attached<00:01:47.280> to<00:01:47.429> the<00:01:47.580> diaphragm<00:01:47.940> where<00:01:48.720> one

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:48.990 
is attached to the diaphragm where one

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:51.980 
is attached to the diaphragm where one
goes<00:01:49.259> the<00:01:49.740> other<00:01:49.770> goes<00:01:50.069> to<00:01:50.659> this<00:01:51.659> interaction

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
goes the other goes to this interaction

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.200 
goes the other goes to this interaction
is<00:01:52.530> the<00:01:52.830> key<00:01:53.069> to<00:01:53.399> understanding<00:01:54.060> how<00:01:54.179> a

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
is the key to understanding how a

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.620 
is the key to understanding how a
speaker<00:01:54.509> works<00:01:55.340> all<00:01:56.340> of<00:01:56.399> this<00:01:56.640> happens<00:01:57.119> in<00:01:57.450> a

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
speaker works all of this happens in a

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.690 
speaker works all of this happens in a
fraction<00:01:57.780> of<00:01:58.140> a<00:01:58.200> second<00:01:58.590> because<00:01:59.250> the<00:01:59.369> current

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
fraction of a second because the current

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:02.440 
fraction of a second because the current
changes<00:02:00.119> Direction<00:02:00.569> very<00:02:00.899> quickly<00:02:01.280> up<00:02:02.280> to

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
changes Direction very quickly up to

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.670 
changes Direction very quickly up to
26,000<00:02:03.450> back-and-forth<00:02:03.990> times<00:02:04.200> a<00:02:04.350> second<00:02:06.680> how

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
26,000 back-and-forth times a second how

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:08.930 
26,000 back-and-forth times a second how
often<00:02:08.160> the<00:02:08.250> direction<00:02:08.640> of<00:02:08.700> the<00:02:08.789> current

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:08.940 
often the direction of the current

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:10.759 
often the direction of the current
changes<00:02:09.509> depends<00:02:09.989> on<00:02:10.079> the<00:02:10.170> sounds<00:02:10.619> the

will<00:02:14.040> get<00:02:14.190> the<00:02:14.310> current<00:02:14.549> to<00:02:14.730> move<00:02:14.910> back<00:02:15.150> and

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:15.180 
will get the current to move back and

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.140 
will get the current to move back and
forth<00:02:15.420> about<00:02:15.930> 40<00:02:16.440> times<00:02:16.680> in<00:02:16.920> one<00:02:17.070> second<00:02:17.519> that

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:18.150 
forth about 40 times in one second that

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.270 
forth about 40 times in one second that
means<00:02:18.359> the<00:02:18.540> diaphragm<00:02:19.290> will<00:02:19.530> vibrate<00:02:19.709> 40

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:20.280 
means the diaphragm will vibrate 40

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:22.480 
means the diaphragm will vibrate 40
times<00:02:20.489> in<00:02:20.670> one<00:02:20.850> second

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:22.490 
times in one second

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:24.520 
times in one second
the<00:02:22.970> faster<00:02:23.330> the<00:02:23.420> current<00:02:23.690> changes<00:02:23.990> direction

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:24.530 
the faster the current changes direction

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.010 
the faster the current changes direction
to<00:02:25.040> faster<00:02:25.490> the<00:02:25.580> diaphragm<00:02:26.030> vibrates<00:02:26.270> and<00:02:26.750> the

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.020 
to faster the diaphragm vibrates and the

sending<00:02:35.240> the<00:02:35.360> proper<00:02:35.750> electrical<00:02:35.960> signals<00:02:36.590> to

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:36.710 
sending the proper electrical signals to

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:39.580 
sending the proper electrical signals to
the<00:02:36.800> proper<00:02:37.160> speaker<00:02:37.780> low<00:02:38.780> sounds<00:02:39.260> go<00:02:39.380> to<00:02:39.440> the

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:39.590 
the proper speaker low sounds go to the

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.040 
the proper speaker low sounds go to the
bigger<00:02:39.770> low<00:02:40.280> frequency<00:02:40.910> speaker<00:02:41.300> while<00:02:41.810> high

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050 
bigger low frequency speaker while high

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:44.490 
bigger low frequency speaker while high
sounds<00:02:42.530> go<00:02:42.710> to<00:02:42.770> the<00:02:42.920> high<00:02:43.190> frequency<00:02:43.220> speaker

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
sounds go to the high frequency speaker

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.410 
sounds go to the high frequency speaker
so<00:02:45.500> it's<00:02:45.980> by<00:02:46.130> controlling<00:02:46.670> the<00:02:46.760> speed<00:02:47.120> of<00:02:47.330> the

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
so it's by controlling the speed of the

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.300 
so it's by controlling the speed of the
changes<00:02:47.810> in<00:02:47.930> direction<00:02:48.350> of<00:02:48.410> the<00:02:48.530> current<00:02:48.920> that

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:49.310 
changes in direction of the current that

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.520 
changes in direction of the current that
we<00:02:49.520> control<00:02:49.940> how<00:02:50.360> low<00:02:50.600> or<00:02:50.870> high<00:02:51.020> the<00:02:51.080> sound

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
we control how low or high the sound

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.690 
we control how low or high the sound
coming<00:02:51.740> out<00:02:51.920> will<00:02:52.070> be<00:02:53.740> simple<00:02:54.740> efficient<00:02:55.550> and

00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:55.700 
coming out will be simple efficient and

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.480 
coming out will be simple efficient and
