 My friend Michael Schumacher started 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:33.390

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:36.119
 to make live concert on jamaica and 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.759
 booked with two live bands and me 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:41.509
 I was in the habit of hanging over that was that 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:44.130
 the beginning 

00:01:41.509 --> 00:01:46.500
 That's how it went on, it always became 

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:48.270
