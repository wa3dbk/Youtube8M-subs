this<00:00:47.940> device<00:00:48.210> is<00:00:49.100> thinner<00:00:50.100> than<00:00:50.340> the<00:00:50.610> HTC<00:00:51.149> One

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
this device is thinner than the HTC One

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.500 
this device is thinner than the HTC One
X<00:00:52.079> but<00:00:53.070> it<00:00:53.190> has<00:00:53.280> the<00:00:53.399> same<00:00:53.699> essentially<00:00:54.390> the

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
X but it has the same essentially the

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:55.850 
X but it has the same essentially the
same<00:00:54.660> screen<00:00:55.079> size<00:00:55.140> is<00:00:55.379> a<00:00:55.559> little<00:00:55.620> bit

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:55.860 
same screen size is a little bit

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.720 
same screen size is a little bit
different<00:00:57.500> take<00:00:58.500> a<00:00:58.530> look<00:00:58.710> there<00:00:59.010> these<00:00:59.579> are

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
different take a look there these are

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:03.080 
different take a look there these are
slightly<00:01:00.000> different<00:01:01.760> brightness<00:01:02.760> settings

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
slightly different brightness settings

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.160

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:04.170 
right now so you can see a little bit

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.160 
right now so you can see a little bit
different<00:01:04.470> a<00:01:04.650> display<00:01:05.580> looked<00:01:05.880> there<00:01:06.119> but<00:01:06.330> you

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
different a display looked there but you

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.899 
different a display looked there but you
see<00:01:07.380> how<00:01:07.470> similar<00:01:07.770> they<00:01:08.010> are<00:01:08.040> really<00:01:08.640> really

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
see how similar they are really really

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.080 
see how similar they are really really
the<00:01:09.060> similar<00:01:09.420> sizes<00:01:09.810> but<00:01:10.770> again<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:11.460> HTC<00:01:11.909> One

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
the similar sizes but again the HTC One

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.570 
the similar sizes but again the HTC One
X<00:01:12.330> is<00:01:12.540> a<00:01:12.570> little<00:01:12.869> bit<00:01:12.990> thicker<00:01:13.590> now<00:01:14.369> if<00:01:14.490> you

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:14.580 
X is a little bit thicker now if you

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.140 
X is a little bit thicker now if you
look<00:01:14.729> here<00:01:15.570> at<00:01:15.780> the<00:01:15.900> HTC<00:01:16.350> One<00:01:16.560> S<00:01:16.970> you<00:01:17.970> have<00:01:18.060> a

look here at the HTC One S you have a
little<00:01:18.479> bit<00:01:18.689> different<00:01:19.070> situation<00:01:20.070> going<00:01:20.280> on

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:20.310 
little bit different situation going on

where<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.580> display<00:01:20.970> is<00:01:21.030> a<00:01:21.299> bit<00:01:21.509> smaller<00:01:21.750> on

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
where the display is a bit smaller on

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.770 
where the display is a bit smaller on
the<00:01:22.020> 1's<00:01:22.170> but<00:01:23.070> on<00:01:23.310> the<00:01:23.490> back<00:01:23.700> you<00:01:24.390> can<00:01:24.420> see<00:01:24.570> that

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
the 1's but on the back you can see that

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.469 
the 1's but on the back you can see that
this<00:01:25.590> material<00:01:26.100> right<00:01:26.250> here<00:01:26.280> is<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.060> same<00:01:27.330> as

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
this material right here is the same as

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:30.050 
this material right here is the same as
the<00:01:27.600> entire<00:01:27.900> back<00:01:28.140> of<00:01:28.320> the<00:01:28.560> issues<00:01:28.829> two<00:01:28.979> 1s<00:01:29.400> now

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
the entire back of the issues two 1s now

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.870 
the entire back of the issues two 1s now
that's<00:01:30.270> the<00:01:30.390> micro<00:01:30.750> oxidation<00:01:31.880> situationally

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
that's the micro oxidation situationally

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.510 
that's the micro oxidation situationally
I<00:01:32.909> got<00:01:33.150> going<00:01:33.299> with<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.630> HTC<00:01:33.930> One<00:01:34.200> series<00:01:34.520> just

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
I got going with the HTC One series just

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:37.310 
I got going with the HTC One series just
with<00:01:35.610> these<00:01:35.729> two<00:01:35.880> devices<00:01:36.090> so<00:01:36.450> far<00:01:36.659> what<00:01:37.200> they

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
with these two devices so far what they

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:38.749 
with these two devices so far what they
do<00:01:37.380> with<00:01:37.590> that<00:01:37.710> is<00:01:37.860> they<00:01:37.979> took<00:01:38.159> this<00:01:38.430> sort<00:01:38.700> of

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
do with that is they took this sort of

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.020 
do with that is they took this sort of
aluminum<00:01:39.750> and<00:01:39.930> turned<00:01:40.350> it<00:01:40.530> into<00:01:40.799> this<00:01:41.189> new

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
aluminum and turned it into this new

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.020 
aluminum and turned it into this new
sort<00:01:42.390> of<00:01:42.649> you<00:01:43.649> know<00:01:43.680> material<00:01:44.250> by<00:01:44.430> adding<00:01:45.000> a

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
sort of you know material by adding a

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:46.910 
sort of you know material by adding a
lot<00:01:45.119> of<00:01:45.240> electricity<00:01:45.630> it<00:01:46.320> means<00:01:46.500> it's<00:01:46.649> a<00:01:46.710> lot

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
lot of electricity it means it's a lot

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.080 
lot of electricity it means it's a lot
more<00:01:47.909> powerful<00:01:48.799> won't<00:01:49.850> you<00:01:50.850> know<00:01:50.939> be

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:51.090 
more powerful won't you know be

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:52.310 
more powerful won't you know be
destroyed<00:01:51.450> as<00:01:51.630> easily<00:01:51.810> because<00:01:52.110> it's<00:01:52.200> already

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
destroyed as easily because it's already

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.810 
destroyed as easily because it's already
been<00:01:52.500> hit<00:01:52.619> now<00:01:52.770> this<00:01:52.950> is<00:01:53.100> the<00:01:53.130> kickstand<00:01:53.700> that

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
been hit now this is the kickstand that
