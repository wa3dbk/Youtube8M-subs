 a remote-controlled special handwriting of the infrared light downtown 

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:10.370
 took 250 meters of cable and a Getac estimates the largest 

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:12.510
 That's how we started two years ago 

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:14.119
 our project 

00:00:14.119 --> 00:00:15.200
 alltogether 

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.950
 one hundred kilos a team of five brought in the special equipment 

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:21.560
 90 meters height 

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.060
 especially Stefan by yes one of the most experienced 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:26.919
 uq experts of Germany 

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:30.229
 He supports us in the project until today 

00:00:30.229 --> 00:00:34.890
 In order to get exciting shots family he hid the webcam in 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.020
 a box so the rare birds were not disturbed 

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:41.260
 Electricity and internet connection 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:44.260
 were placed over 200 meters to the next house 

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.350
 For the past two years, viewers around the world have been able to enjoy the life of the world 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.040
 Customer family here live calms down 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.000
 and afterwards Prof 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
 Of course, a little bit more belong to us 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:01.800
 on 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.449
 already after few days known loudest rarest 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:07.490
 being child Inter rock wall by boat 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:11.119
 Thirty-four healthy chicks hatched 34 days later 

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.920
 equal two and one human 

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:20.080
 five weeks later 

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:23.820
 Stefan Drescher climbed the steep cliff face for the second time 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:26.010
 To bring clock boys 

00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:30.140
 about a thousand spectators from all over the world were present on our webcam live 

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:32.860
 USD were despite Monday 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.860
 every point about a kilo 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:41.229
 In order not to frighten the boys in the action, Stefan BrÃ¼cher covered them 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:45.160
 Carefully he has already ringed more than 2000 trolleybuses 

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:50.320
 At about five weeks, the offspring is big enough to have a light aluminum 

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:51.980
 Rain to wear around the foot 

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:54.010
 the rings are provided with data 

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:58.200
 and provide the experts with important information about the crew population 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.200
 throughout rhineland-palatinate 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:08.410
 Also our internet camera provides many details about the behavior of the 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:11.410
 biggest novelty 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:15.549
 already three months later in May 2008 

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:18.979
 the boys had grown up to magnificent complaints 

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:22.579
 Neus rich year and good weather conditions had him in the 

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:24.629
 Make life easier 

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:27.999
 more than 132 grams are Internet visitors 

00:02:27.999 --> 00:02:30.780
 could follow the everyday life of the Kolping family 

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.780
 Dez to her farewell 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:39.629
 In the last year the cooling fell threatening instead took our 

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:43.120
 Internet camera impressing images of foxes in the rock face 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:48.139
 we are looking forward to the return of our u 

00:02:48.139 --> 00:02:49.529
 USD this year 

00:02:49.529 --> 00:02:52.029
 Geneva we have project through our webcam 

00:02:52.029 --> 00:02:55.029
 already fight this one 

00:02:55.529 --> 00:02:59.159
 Hard to believe really in the steep rock wall foxes 

00:02:59.669 --> 00:03:02.749
 Per cent, how do they get there audiobooks and above all things 

00:03:02.749 --> 00:03:06.769
 we are not dangerous to our faithful the turn does not need to be dangerous there 

00:03:06.769 --> 00:03:08.009
 we are not to be scared 

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:11.169
 only are very defensive and have the last year also the 

00:03:11.169 --> 00:03:13.639
 Fox 00 o'clock from the show direction 

00:03:13.639 --> 00:03:15.969
 This then just climbs very well 

00:03:15.969 --> 00:03:19.349
 11 They have excellent but in spite of everything we did not breed like that 

00:03:19.349 --> 00:03:20.989
 Kant 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:23.989
 yes that was a bad word he made out to around three euros 

00:03:24.499 --> 00:03:28.959
 the number of prey for oviposition very important No and little 

00:03:28.959 --> 00:03:31.029
 new so few gifts in the election 

00:03:31.029 --> 00:03:32.239
 Idol and 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:35.489
 and then even a bad weather in spring, she is Roman 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:40.469
 The Calling Woman kills tough wood as a gift by gifts as well 

00:03:40.469 --> 00:03:44.930
 in the bread mood under her better he could get the better 

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:45.719
 only 

00:03:45.719 --> 00:03:47.649
 take care later and 

00:03:47.649 --> 00:03:49.969
 insofar it is again so far as students 

00:03:49.969 --> 00:03:53.999
 important signal what to read where Bossi how many eggs I lay this 

00:03:53.999 --> 00:03:54.789
 year 

00:03:54.789 --> 00:03:59.559
 He finally had this burglary last year at the breed 

00:03:59.559 --> 00:04:03.199
 yes then actually this success story Osiander gets old 

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:06.379
 I do not think so, and I do not hope so 

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:09.819
 What exactly did that impact Werner the first years noticed 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:11.009
 then stop 

00:04:11.009 --> 00:04:15.659
 so to speak, the band's offspring had been missing in a year or so 

00:04:15.659 --> 00:04:20.349
 Half missing had of course the losses in the breeding pairs 

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:23.539
 be balanced a little worse but we shall be how big is 

00:04:23.539 --> 00:04:26.139
 because the chance that we will actually return this year 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:29.120
 All the projects I call have a very good chance 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.900
 So will be two Russians gone several days ago a camera several times 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:33.849
 seen 

00:04:33.849 --> 00:04:36.199
 and so are even louder today 

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:39.949
 So I suppose so the UBA female is definitely left again brings 

00:04:39.949 --> 00:04:41.550
 Friedbert before Raul was 

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:43.330
 and dumb 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:45.210
 I assume that we are like that 

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:47.819
 that means what would we be in the next few weeks 

00:04:47.819 --> 00:04:51.569
 and months can see if all goes on just like that 

00:04:51.569 --> 00:04:55.400
 the soon is putting in the first few weeks put up on the post 

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:59.610
 Elber on the dung Molder the male creates a hollow attempt the female 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:01.029
 but to lure him 

00:05:01.029 --> 00:05:04.929
 and when will Jochen Jung of urgent in the first two three weeks
