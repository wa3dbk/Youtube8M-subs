 the Templars believed that they should kill 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.540
 all the villagers so that others 

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:51.280

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:53.260
 relics without fighting and the assassins 

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.150

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:57.070
 and secretly not to alert the 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:59.290
 authorities and that they did not have to fight 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:01.150
 the Templars did not agree and 

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:01.720
 murdered all the assassins who 

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:03.670
