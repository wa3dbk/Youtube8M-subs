body dr. Scott Berkman will talk about

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.410 
body dr. Scott Berkman will talk about
how<00:00:49.829> an<00:00:50.010> opening<00:00:50.430> is<00:00:50.550> made<00:00:50.789> to<00:00:51.059> create<00:00:51.210> a

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
how an opening is made to create a

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.290 
how an opening is made to create a
channel<00:00:51.840> from<00:00:52.260> the<00:00:52.410> skin<00:00:52.680> to<00:00:52.890> the<00:00:52.920> bladder

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:53.300 
channel from the skin to the bladder

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:56.360 
channel from the skin to the bladder
this<00:00:54.300> opening<00:00:54.840> is<00:00:54.930> called<00:00:55.230> a<00:00:55.320> urinary<00:00:55.800> stoma

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
this opening is called a urinary stoma

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.119 
this opening is called a urinary stoma
or<00:00:56.520> urostomy<00:00:57.289> so<00:00:58.289> sometimes<00:00:58.559> some<00:00:59.010> of<00:00:59.070> the

00:00:59.119 --> 00:00:59.129 
or urostomy so sometimes some of the

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:01.610 
or urostomy so sometimes some of the
kids<00:00:59.340> have<00:00:59.730> tried<00:01:00.480> catheterization<00:01:01.230> before

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
kids have tried catheterization before

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.139 
kids have tried catheterization before
and<00:01:01.949> they're<00:01:02.219> unable<00:01:02.399> to<00:01:02.730> get<00:01:02.879> into<00:01:03.059> the

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
and they're unable to get into the

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:06.140 
and they're unable to get into the
bladder<00:01:03.329> because<00:01:03.809> of<00:01:04.250> irregular<00:01:05.250> channels

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
bladder because of irregular channels

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.719 
bladder because of irregular channels
that<00:01:06.330> they've<00:01:06.540> developed<00:01:06.840> in<00:01:07.200> their<00:01:07.500> urethra

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:07.729 
that they've developed in their urethra

00:01:07.729 --> 00:01:10.550 
that they've developed in their urethra
so<00:01:08.729> if<00:01:08.820> they<00:01:08.939> can't<00:01:09.210> get<00:01:09.420> in<00:01:09.600> or<00:01:09.960> if<00:01:10.260> they<00:01:10.409> have

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:10.560 
so if they can't get in or if they have

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.100 
so if they can't get in or if they have
pain<00:01:10.860> getting<00:01:11.189> in<00:01:11.460> then<00:01:12.299> we<00:01:12.479> try<00:01:12.689> to<00:01:12.750> create<00:01:13.049> a

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
pain getting in then we try to create a

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.480 
pain getting in then we try to create a
channel<00:01:13.439> so<00:01:13.650> that<00:01:13.799> they<00:01:13.920> can<00:01:14.040> catheterize

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
channel so that they can catheterize

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.670 
channel so that they can catheterize
through<00:01:14.700> their<00:01:14.850> abdominal<00:01:15.270> wall<00:01:15.479> and<00:01:15.780> so<00:01:16.650> a

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
through their abdominal wall and so a

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.410 
through their abdominal wall and so a
channel<00:01:17.130> can<00:01:17.280> be<00:01:17.400> made<00:01:17.610> out<00:01:17.640> of<00:01:17.790> preferably

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
channel can be made out of preferably

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.960 
channel can be made out of preferably
the<00:01:18.600> appendix<00:01:19.140> and<00:01:19.409> if<00:01:20.220> the<00:01:20.340> appendix<00:01:20.700> is<00:01:20.790> not

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
the appendix and if the appendix is not

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.609 
the appendix and if the appendix is not
available<00:01:21.240> we<00:01:21.540> can<00:01:21.689> make<00:01:21.869> a<00:01:21.900> tube<00:01:22.200> out<00:01:22.439> of<00:01:22.530> the

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
available we can make a tube out of the

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.260 
available we can make a tube out of the
small<00:01:22.830> intestine<00:01:23.369> and<00:01:23.580> create<00:01:23.850> a<00:01:23.880> catheter<00:01:24.210> I
