happens although the thought is that the

happens although the thought is that the

retinoid<00:02:02.010> can<00:02:02.700> also<00:02:02.910> work<00:02:03.330> so<00:02:03.720> retin-a<00:02:04.470> or

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
retinoid can also work so retin-a or

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.820 
retinoid can also work so retin-a or
Tretton<00:02:05.220> Eric<00:02:05.490> acid<00:02:05.940> or<00:02:06.240> as<00:02:06.540> lake<00:02:07.110> acid<00:02:07.620> and

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:07.830 
Tretton Eric acid or as lake acid and

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:09.830 
Tretton Eric acid or as lake acid and
again<00:02:08.460> how<00:02:08.790> that<00:02:09.060> causes<00:02:09.600> a<00:02:09.630> slight

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840 
again how that causes a slight

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:11.840 
again how that causes a slight
irritation<00:02:10.170> with<00:02:10.710> the<00:02:10.800> skin<00:02:11.070> and<00:02:11.280> causes<00:02:11.670> the

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:11.850 
irritation with the skin and causes the

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:15.860 
irritation with the skin and causes the
dead<00:02:12.030> skin<00:02:12.270> layer<00:02:12.420> to<00:02:12.780> come<00:02:13.110> off<00:02:13.970> sometimes<00:02:14.970> it

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:15.870 
dead skin layer to come off sometimes it

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.470 
dead skin layer to come off sometimes it
can<00:02:16.080> cause<00:02:16.320> a<00:02:16.350> little<00:02:16.560> bit<00:02:16.740> of<00:02:16.800> redness<00:02:17.330> but<00:02:18.330> if

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
can cause a little bit of redness but if

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:20.810 
can cause a little bit of redness but if
you<00:02:18.630> persist<00:02:19.170> with<00:02:19.470> it<00:02:19.650> then<00:02:19.890> that<00:02:20.550> usually

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:20.820 
you persist with it then that usually

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.700 
you persist with it then that usually
goes<00:02:21.300> away<00:02:21.330> but<00:02:21.960> if<00:02:22.080> it<00:02:22.230> doesn't<00:02:22.440> then

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:22.710 
goes away but if it doesn't then

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:25.040 
goes away but if it doesn't then
obviously<00:02:23.040> you<00:02:23.370> need<00:02:23.550> to<00:02:23.670> stop<00:02:23.970> you<00:02:24.570> can't<00:02:24.810> use

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
obviously you need to stop you can't use

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:27.620 
obviously you need to stop you can't use
retinoid<00:02:25.740> vitamin<00:02:26.250> A<00:02:26.400> based<00:02:26.970> products<00:02:27.390> if
