00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:19.970
 We received luigi's very soon 

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:21.860
 Mansion 2 on Nintendo 3ds and how it comes 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:23.720
 being usual every time a game is 

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:25.910
 about its launch are still 

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:28.160
 appearing more and more videos so 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:29.630
 official that yes videos of great quality 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.360
 like the one we're going to see next 

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:34.309
 is the last video that publishes nintendo 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.230
 to show us another one of its ways 

00:00:34.309 --> 00:00:38.809
 multiplayer this time we 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:41.059
 we find before the way called sky 

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:42.980
 disagree in this game mode we will have 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:45.140
 the option to play with local players 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:47.510
 or players from all over the world through 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.610
 online mode the maximum number of 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.980
 players that you can support is from a 

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:53.810
 total of 4 but a lot of eye because if 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:56.660
 we have a friend who also has a 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:59.420
 Nintendo 3ds and is next to us 

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:01.489
 download the game on your 3ds for 

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.290
 play with us that yes in this 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:05.630
 occasion we will not be in a way 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:08.149
 full multiplayer in this mode is 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.670
 katy script air we are before 

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:11.720
 another adventure totally different from the 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.090
 Single-player 

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:16.490
 this time we are a group of 

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:18.770
 luigi's of various colors that we must 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.930
 clean each of the sites to 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.880
 move to the next level but a lot 

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:25.150
 attention because the most curious thing is that 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.410
 each of the levels restarts 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:29.570
 automatically every time we go from 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:31.850
 level that is to say creates the different 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:34.040
 elements the different enemies in 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:36.710
 different points so that we can never 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.870
 learn each of those levels that 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.790
 we will have to overcome basically 

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:42.979
 we will have to go aspiring to all kinds 

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:45.200
 of ghosts that will get closer to us 

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:47.420
 little by little but even though it seems 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.850
 that we are ghost hunters this is not 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.560
 our only mission we will also have 

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.930
 than finding different keys to 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:56.450
 open more rooms and keep aspiring 

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:58.460
 ghosts every time we finish one of 

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:01.070
 the levels will appear four currencies 

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:03.530
 red these coins can be used in 

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:05.390
 a machine and each player will have the 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.910
 opportunity to get different 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:10.640
 special prizes logically how many 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:12.410
 more coins we get more opportunities 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.570
 We will have to win prizes and we will 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.580
 you will ask how long this mode is 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:18.860
 of game, I can assure you that it is 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.510
 very long since there is no end to it 

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.850
 finish the game will have to be 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:25.430
 defeated all the luigi's who are 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:27.500
 playing a very difficult thing and that is 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.630
 if one of the louis always dies 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.580
 to be revived by another who is still 

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:34.130
 we will have to solve a series 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:36.110
 of puzzles but eye because also 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:38.090
 We will have to fight against big 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.490
 chief bosses to whom to 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.710
 defeat them we will have to use a 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:44.990
 strategy since it will not be so easy 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:47.540
 we will have to find the way to defeat 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:49.610
 to these chiefs the truth is that with this 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:51.350
 and other modes of multiplayer game 

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:53.900
 We will come with luigi's mansion 2 

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:57.350
