00:00:00.449 --> 00:00:02.470
 hi i am china i am 

00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:04.660
 very happy happy 

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:08.799
 then share this day with all of you today is a video that has been 

00:00:08.799 --> 00:00:09.900
 asked a lot 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.809
 and I instead of doing it for a long time 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:18.730
 percent I'm sure this is a fantastic diet I told him I have 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:23.740
 the name of the best athlete in the world 100% guaranteed 

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:28.689
 the changes of state managers to become so amazing 

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:34.500
 I'm sure you're expected to agree with the comments below 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.010
 then in addition to paper and pencil 

00:00:38.859 --> 00:00:41.859
 and we started with this fantastic 

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:50.900
 again principles as a basis as far as health and plaster are concerned 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:57.699
 and that's why the beloved gil happened to these principles that steller and crankcase and c 

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:01.969
 I did not even get rid of that, it's because each of them is that I like them 

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:02.850
 natural 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.080
 the practical in the economic 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:09.460
 she thinks that health as well as beauty should not cost an eye of the 

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:13.570
 face so I've done I do not think Spain suffers from what I can say 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:14.830
 extended 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:19.380
 and that's to say I do not believe in diets for me diets like those 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.660
 aesthetic surgeries are short-term solutions 

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:32.000
 for me it is more important to follow 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.960
 let's educate ourselves in terms of limiting those bad habits we have 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.300
 I know that for many people it is difficult but neither is it impossible 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.040
 many people who have already done it 

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:50.890
 and that tells testimonies of two changes they have made in their lives and who have 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:54.960
 markedly improved his health and also his physical appearance 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.960
 refers to wanting to lose a few extra books 

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:04.310
 then hundreds and packages I want to share it and up to the hundred you're from 

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:09.269
 frontrange solutions not penalties options would be better the word 

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:12.409
 of the project arguments that are going to be 

00:02:12.409 --> 00:02:14.289
 much better for you 

00:02:14.289 --> 00:02:16.580
 as far as ag is concerned 

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.980
 he will not show us his body 

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.519
 percent with the goal that you should have food science feeds 

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:32.019
 I would not be responsible for my part 

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:37.049
 the case of invest recommendations for any of you because I do not 

00:02:37.049 --> 00:02:38.810
 I know the condition 

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:42.980
 per cent that his body and so knew her neither did the doctor 

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:47.360
 ignored and a dietitian so it's very important that you consult professional 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.499
 before submitting to your body 

00:02:49.499 --> 00:02:52.499
 to someone 

00:02:55.179 --> 00:02:58.399
 speak properly about this because, like you, too 

00:02:58.399 --> 00:03:01.399
 determined 

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:12.599
 thankfully one hundred percent 

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:13.629
 ee 

00:03:13.629 --> 00:03:19.040
 try this the call here were eliminated and after that ja 

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:21.210
 in exchange always 

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:28.360
 I'm happy Santander with the rally that Jorge placed if the cities I can 

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:32.520
 Transcendent azimid environment and my body and I do not want that to happen 

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:36.140
 I believe that everything in this life is an investment 

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:39.360
 one invests in love to be happy 

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.329
 union pour their education to have economic stability 

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:50.170
 one invests in their diet and makes smart decisions when it comes to 

00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:51.690
 choose our body 

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:57.530
 because we want a healthy old age and that is the invitation for all of you 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:01.260
 to make better decisions make a better investment 

00:04:02.219 --> 00:04:08.049
 in her health because she does not have precisions sixtine health we are nothing 

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:13.069
 I drink fa so that I can be sharing some good recipes 

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:14.079
 options 

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:18.439
 per cent that you may have to leave easy and economical and 

00:04:19.359 --> 00:04:21.469
 and natural 

00:04:21.469 --> 00:04:27.629
 that I have learned the fifth and financial the sec that I have had to improve in my 

00:04:27.629 --> 00:04:32.559
 health and I also took some cooking classes and I was also lucky 

00:04:32.559 --> 00:04:35.559
 work for a family that in my anxiety 

00:04:36.229 --> 00:04:41.120
 i the teachers who had one of them had since england pilots are were 

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:45.680
 specialists in specific checks on healthy food 

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:49.310
 and they saw that I liked the kitchen and the interest in loving 

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:50.650

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:54.070
 and for having dictated assured that you have to take things with them they are 

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:55.630

00:04:55.630 --> 00:05:00.070
 the opportunity to learn then that with investment that I made was something 

00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:01.100
 smart 

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:03.849
