the<00:00:53.219> real<00:00:53.430> question<00:00:53.879> is<00:00:54.000> if<00:00:54.270> you<00:00:54.510> are<00:00:54.629> planning

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
the real question is if you are planning

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:56.689 
the real question is if you are planning
to<00:00:55.020> land<00:00:55.230> a<00:00:55.379> rocket<00:00:55.530> on<00:00:55.800> a<00:00:55.829> tiny<00:00:56.100> platform

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
to land a rocket on a tiny platform

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.639 
to land a rocket on a tiny platform
would<00:00:57.120> you<00:00:57.300> let<00:00:57.480> a<00:00:57.510> little<00:00:57.809> rain<00:00:57.989> get<00:00:58.410> in<00:00:58.500> your

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
would you let a little rain get in your

00:00:58.649 --> 00:00:59.500 
would you let a little rain get in your
way

00:00:59.500 --> 00:00:59.510 
way

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.389 
way
actually<00:01:00.510> good<00:01:00.690> yeah<00:01:01.020> yeah<00:01:01.469> I<00:01:01.500> probably<00:01:01.859> would

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
actually good yeah yeah I probably would

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.820 
actually good yeah yeah I probably would

NASA<00:01:49.860> prepares<00:01:50.220> for<00:01:50.490> this<00:01:50.640> but<00:01:51.390> what<00:01:51.479> if<00:01:51.570> it

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:51.659 
NASA prepares for this but what if it

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:53.420 
NASA prepares for this but what if it
happens<00:01:51.930> in<00:01:52.049> flight<00:01:52.259> that<00:01:52.590> would<00:01:52.710> actually<00:01:53.310> be
