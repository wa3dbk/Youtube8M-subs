how<00:00:04.020> much<00:00:04.200> rotation<00:00:04.710> I<00:00:04.799> get<00:00:05.009> that's<00:00:05.910> how<00:00:06.060> it

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.150 
how much rotation I get that's how it

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.160 
how much rotation I get that's how it
worn<00:00:06.359> out<00:00:06.509> these<00:00:06.950> hubs<00:00:07.950> are<00:00:08.840> that's<00:00:09.840> probably

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:10.170 
worn out these hubs are that's probably

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:17.269 
worn out these hubs are that's probably
not<00:00:10.290> good<00:00:14.389> yeah<00:00:15.389> well<00:00:15.540> it's<00:00:15.870> okay<00:00:16.080> that's<00:00:17.070> what

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
not good yeah well it's okay that's what

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:18.830 
not good yeah well it's okay that's what
you<00:00:17.369> do<00:00:17.490> you<00:00:17.760> ride<00:00:17.970> them<00:00:18.090> till<00:00:18.300> they<00:00:18.390> break<00:00:18.630> and

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
you do you ride them till they break and

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.750 
you do you ride them till they break and
then<00:00:18.990> you<00:00:19.080> fix<00:00:19.289> them<00:00:19.500> and<00:00:20.039> then<00:00:20.369> you<00:00:20.490> ride<00:00:20.640> the

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:20.760 
then you fix them and then you ride the

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.029 
then you fix them and then you ride the
hell<00:00:20.910> out<00:00:21.029> of<00:00:21.060> them<00:00:21.240> some<00:00:21.359> more<00:00:21.920> it<00:00:22.920> moves

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
hell out of them some more it moves

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:29.439 
hell out of them some more it moves
pretty<00:00:23.430> good<00:00:24.350> yeah<00:00:25.350> that's<00:00:25.830> probably<00:00:25.980> bad<00:00:26.279> oh

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:29.449 

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:31.490 

well<00:00:30.449> there<00:00:31.109> we<00:00:31.140> go

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:31.500 
well there we go

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.470 
well there we go
on<00:00:31.650> the<00:00:31.830> jack<00:00:32.009> stands<00:00:32.250> it<00:00:32.399> goes<00:00:32.579> but<00:00:33.270> look<00:00:33.390> at

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
on the jack stands it goes but look at

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:38.600 
on the jack stands it goes but look at
this<00:00:35.480> yeah<00:00:36.480> I<00:00:36.899> noticed<00:00:37.410> that<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:38.040> I<00:00:38.340> got<00:00:38.489> to

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
this yeah I noticed that the I got to

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.540 
this yeah I noticed that the I got to
pick<00:00:38.790> up<00:00:38.879> new<00:00:39.030> hubs<00:00:39.559> this<00:00:40.559> spline<00:00:40.920> shaft<00:00:41.190> here

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
pick up new hubs this spline shaft here

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.280 
pick up new hubs this spline shaft here
is<00:00:41.700> in<00:00:41.850> great<00:00:42.059> shape<00:00:42.090> I<00:00:42.600> noticed<00:00:43.079> there<00:00:43.170> was

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:43.290 
is in great shape I noticed there was

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:44.930 
is in great shape I noticed there was
play<00:00:43.500> in<00:00:43.710> the<00:00:43.800> tires<00:00:44.040> you<00:00:44.280> know<00:00:44.309> I'd<00:00:44.489> have<00:00:44.700> I

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
play in the tires you know I'd have I

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:48.319 
play in the tires you know I'd have I
could<00:00:45.420> clock<00:00:45.660> it<00:00:45.870> several<00:00:46.260> degrees<00:00:46.460> and<00:00:47.460> these

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
could clock it several degrees and these

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.420 
could clock it several degrees and these
teeth<00:00:48.539> are<00:00:48.660> good<00:00:48.870> these<00:00:49.620> teeth<00:00:49.860> are<00:00:49.980> worn<00:00:50.160> out

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
teeth are good these teeth are worn out

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.350 
teeth are good these teeth are worn out
and<00:00:50.820> they<00:00:51.600> probably<00:00:51.780> can't<00:00:52.079> even<00:00:52.110> see<00:00:52.230> that<00:00:52.559> I

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:53.360 
and they probably can't even see that I

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.639 
and they probably can't even see that I
was<00:00:54.360> thinking<00:00:54.600> of<00:00:54.690> filling<00:00:55.020> a<00:00:55.110> hole<00:00:55.140> with<00:00:55.440> j-b

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
was thinking of filling a hole with j-b

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.410 
was thinking of filling a hole with j-b
weld<00:00:55.800> and<00:00:56.219> slamming<00:00:56.579> these<00:00:56.699> things<00:00:56.940> back<00:00:57.210> on

00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:57.420 
weld and slamming these things back on

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.639 
weld and slamming these things back on
but<00:00:57.600> that's<00:00:57.690> probably<00:00:58.050> not<00:00:58.199> the<00:00:58.260> right<00:00:58.440> way<00:00:58.590> to

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
but that's probably not the right way to

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.189 
but that's probably not the right way to
go<00:00:58.859> so<00:00:59.180> yeah<00:01:00.180> when<00:01:00.359> I<00:01:00.420> get<00:01:00.570> home<00:01:00.690> on<00:01:00.840> to<00:01:01.050> look

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
go so yeah when I get home on to look

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:14.060 
go so yeah when I get home on to look
for<00:01:01.379> some<00:01:01.559> hubs<00:01:08.810> flat<00:01:09.810> that<00:01:10.049> is<00:01:11.420> and<00:01:13.070> come

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
for some hubs flat that is and come

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.399 
for some hubs flat that is and come
around<00:01:14.250> this<00:01:14.430> way

00:01:18.399 --> 00:01:18.409 

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:20.990 

you<00:01:19.409> can<00:01:19.590> feel<00:01:19.950> look<00:01:20.520> at<00:01:20.610> that<00:01:20.729> Ridge<00:01:20.970> right

there that's almost a well that's at
least<00:01:26.850> 1/16<00:01:27.720> of<00:01:27.869> an<00:01:27.990> inch

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:28.909

I<00:01:55.320> need<00:01:56.070> a<00:01:56.130> rig<00:01:56.310> out<00:01:56.490> of<00:01:56.610> service<00:01:56.850> I<00:01:57.740> figure

00:01:58.730 --> 00:01:58.740 
I need a rig out of service I figure

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:59.959 
I need a rig out of service I figure
it's<00:01:58.860> better<00:01:58.979> to<00:01:59.219> take<00:01:59.369> it<00:01:59.520> out<00:01:59.640> of<00:01:59.759> service

00:01:59.959 --> 00:01:59.969 
it's better to take it out of service

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.170 
it's better to take it out of service
now<00:02:00.270> before<00:02:00.719> something<00:02:00.960> really<00:02:01.259> breaks<00:02:01.500> I

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
now before something really breaks I

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.959 
now before something really breaks I
separated<00:02:03.180> the<00:02:03.329> hubs<00:02:03.509> from<00:02:03.750> the<00:02:03.899> Rams<00:02:04.969> this

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
separated the hubs from the Rams this

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.399 
separated the hubs from the Rams this
gives<00:02:06.210> you<00:02:06.270> a<00:02:06.329> better<00:02:06.479> idea<00:02:06.600> of<00:02:06.960> just<00:02:07.079> how<00:02:07.320> it

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
gives you a better idea of just how it

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:14.370 
gives you a better idea of just how it
worn<00:02:07.590> out<00:02:07.710> there

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:22.069 
that's the right one the other side nice

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:23.680 
that's the right one the other side nice
