00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.259
 Hello friends, I'm going to show you how 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.190
 make a skeleton for a 

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:09.870
 scarecrow 

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:12.110
 I'm going to use threaded rods in 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:17.480
 beginning three strips 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:20.670
 of a meter of 12 millimeters and two strips 

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:25.020
 of 6 millimeters equal one meter 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:28.290
 an old ball little wire you go to 

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:30.200
 need a radial and a sun group 

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:31.760
 bucket welding 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:34.450
 and of course the protection 

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.450
 correspondent 

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:44.160
 oh well I'm also going to put some 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:44.160
 12 mm nuts and 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:53.460
 2 and 24 nuts for breaks so it's worth 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:57.440
 we will cut one of the rods 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:01:01.899
 approximately half well 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:05.570
 We cut here and I have it cover 

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:08.200
 that we can discard it well this would be 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.200
 our body 

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:13.500
 here one of them 

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:22.850
 we are going to put it you see it better 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:25.689
 an idea here 

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.689
 another idea here 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:34.350
 you see that would be the legs 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:37.020
 we leave them one meter to be able 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:38.580
 then bury in the field and that is not 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:42.960
 we fall 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:44.360
 and the next one we're going to put here between 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:47.140
 socks 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.140
 you will see the nuts 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:55.130
 and then the ball his position would be 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.130
 about here 

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:00.290
 he fell 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:04.360
 This is to give you an idea of 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:04.360
 how will it look after welding 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.630
 good man does not stay to see 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:16.110
 miami 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.110
 Well, this would be 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:24.420
 what will it look like 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:27.840
 our scarecrow skeletons 

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:30.800
 here now I explain the nuts what 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.800
 I do this imprisoned 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:36.580
 the 6 mm rod with the two 

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:39.380
 nuts to give me a solid foundation 

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:42.080
 to be able to weld properly and not 

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:44.230
 the solder escapes us equally and 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:48.190
 what I do 

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:50.020
 with the bottom to be able to have 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:51.750
 there holes 

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:55.830
 where to weld 

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:57.690
 well then let's proceed 

00:02:55.830 --> 00:03:00.450
 I will use the wire so that 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:02.690
 help keep the piece still at 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.690
 face 

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:10.120
 to be able to weld more comfortably today 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:10.120
 we proceed to it
