00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.740 

hello<00:00:01.500> again<00:00:01.920> back<00:00:02.700> with<00:00:02.909> you<00:00:03.090> mean<00:00:03.300> particle

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:03.750 
hello again back with you mean particle

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.629 
hello again back with you mean particle
stop<00:00:04.520> and<00:00:05.520> let's<00:00:06.029> start<00:00:06.390> by<00:00:06.859> taking<00:00:07.859> a<00:00:08.069> look<00:00:08.099> at

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:08.639 
stop and let's start by taking a look at

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.600 
stop and let's start by taking a look at
some<00:00:08.970> new<00:00:09.630> particle<00:00:10.559> instance<00:00:11.070> modifier

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610 
some new particle instance modifier

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:17.660 
some new particle instance modifier
stuff<00:00:12.889> so<00:00:13.889> let's<00:00:14.540> first<00:00:16.340> duplicate<00:00:17.340> the

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:17.670 
stuff so let's first duplicate the

00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:24.560 
stuff so let's first duplicate the
default<00:00:18.270> cube<00:00:18.570> and<00:00:20.720> scale<00:00:21.720> it<00:00:21.750> business<00:00:23.570> then

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
default cube and scale it business then

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:29.240 
default cube and scale it business then
let's<00:00:25.019> add<00:00:25.820> just<00:00:26.820> a<00:00:27.029> basic<00:00:27.449> care<00:00:28.349> it<00:00:28.890> could

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:29.250 
let's add just a basic care it could

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.740 
let's add just a basic care it could
also<00:00:29.460> be<00:00:29.699> normal<00:00:30.330> particles<00:00:31.940> but<00:00:32.940> the<00:00:33.540> air

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:33.750 
also be normal particles but the air

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:36.470 
also be normal particles but the air
updates<00:00:34.290> quite<00:00:34.739> nicely<00:00:35.010> for<00:00:35.730> this<00:00:36.239> example

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
updates quite nicely for this example

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:42.639 
updates quite nicely for this example
let's<00:00:38.180> get<00:00:39.180> on<00:00:39.390> to<00:00:40.219> something<00:00:41.219> quite<00:00:41.489> well

00:00:42.639 --> 00:00:42.649 
let's get on to something quite well

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:47.900 
let's get on to something quite well
okay<00:00:43.879> then<00:00:44.879> let's<00:00:45.510> add<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:46.910> particle

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:47.910 
okay then let's add the particle

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:53.119 
okay then let's add the particle
instance<00:00:48.510> modifier<00:00:49.520> to<00:00:50.520> the<00:00:51.710> duplicated<00:00:52.710> cube

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
instance modifier to the duplicated cube

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:58.939 
instance modifier to the duplicated cube
and<00:00:53.750> set<00:00:54.750> it<00:00:54.870> to<00:00:55.140> use<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:57.680> mesh<00:00:58.680> with<00:00:58.920> the

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
and set it to use the mesh with the

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:06.469 
and set it to use the mesh with the
particle<00:00:59.940> hair<00:01:01.609> so<00:01:03.500> as<00:01:04.500> we<00:01:04.799> can<00:01:04.949> see<00:01:05.450> there<00:01:06.450> are

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479 
particle hair so as we can see there are

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:11.800 
particle hair so as we can see there are
many<00:01:06.900> instances<00:01:07.290> of<00:01:07.890> the<00:01:09.200> original<00:01:10.200> cube<00:01:10.590> and

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:11.810 
many instances of the original cube and

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:15.050 
many instances of the original cube and
like<00:01:12.810> always<00:01:13.049> that<00:01:13.380> spin<00:01:13.830> the<00:01:14.130> option<00:01:14.729> to<00:01:14.760> use

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
like always that spin the option to use

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:21.859 
like always that spin the option to use
the<00:01:15.360> heart<00:01:18.740> for<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:20.360> instances<00:01:21.360> but<00:01:21.630> now<00:01:21.810> we

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
the heart for the instances but now we

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.210 
the heart for the instances but now we
also<00:01:22.290> have<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:23.159> option<00:01:23.400> to<00:01:23.670> set<00:01:24.390> the<00:01:24.600> position

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:25.220 
also have the option to set the position

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:30.230 
also have the option to set the position
in<00:01:26.220> part<00:01:26.580> which<00:01:27.450> is<00:01:27.479> used<00:01:27.960> and<00:01:28.680> also<00:01:29.400> to<00:01:29.909> and

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
in part which is used and also to and

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:36.260 
in part which is used and also to and
demise<00:01:30.540> it<00:01:31.400> and<00:01:32.630> I<00:01:33.630> think<00:01:33.840> if<00:01:34.380> the<00:01:35.270> modifier

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
demise it and I think if the modifier

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.600 
demise it and I think if the modifier
values<00:01:36.810> become<00:01:37.229> animate<00:01:37.680> well<00:01:37.979> then<00:01:38.310> this

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:38.610 
values become animate well then this

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.340 
values become animate well then this
will<00:01:38.850> give<00:01:39.689> us<00:01:39.720> quite<00:01:40.320> some<00:01:40.860> nice<00:01:41.820> options

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:42.350 
will give us quite some nice options

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:48.249 
will give us quite some nice options
also<00:01:44.869> notice<00:01:45.869> the<00:01:46.079> option<00:01:46.409> to<00:01:46.439> keep<00:01:47.340> the<00:01:47.520> shape

00:01:48.249 --> 00:01:48.259 
also notice the option to keep the shape

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:54.859 
also notice the option to keep the shape
which<00:01:50.570> don't<00:01:51.570> deform<00:01:52.079> but<00:01:52.649> only<00:01:53.869> positions

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
which don't deform but only positions

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:59.899 
which don't deform but only positions
the<00:01:56.180> instance<00:01:57.180> is<00:01:57.360> on<00:01:57.659> the<00:01:57.840> past<00:01:58.790> and<00:01:59.790> of

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
the instance is on the past and of

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:04.850 
the instance is on the past and of
course<00:02:00.210> it<00:02:00.329> can<00:02:00.509> also<00:02:00.689> be<00:02:00.920> randomized

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:04.860 

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:10.340 

say<00:02:05.640> nothing<00:02:05.790> more<00:02:06.270> about<00:02:06.330> that<00:02:09.140> then<00:02:10.140> there

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:10.350 
say nothing more about that then there

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:15.620 
say nothing more about that then there
are<00:02:10.380> some<00:02:10.710> new<00:02:11.670> options<00:02:13.370> for<00:02:14.480> drawing<00:02:15.480> the

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:15.630 
are some new options for drawing the

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:22.730 
are some new options for drawing the
hair<00:02:15.960> parts<00:02:18.470> in<00:02:19.490> the<00:02:20.490> rendering<00:02:21.210> options<00:02:21.740> in

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:22.740 
hair parts in the rendering options in

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:29.949 
hair parts in the rendering options in
the<00:02:23.280> timing<00:02:24.030> section<00:02:26.000> so<00:02:27.000> before<00:02:27.510> we<00:02:27.720> could

00:02:29.949 --> 00:02:29.959 
the timing section so before we could

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:34.400 
the timing section so before we could
set<00:02:30.959> the<00:02:31.260> maximum<00:02:32.010> length<00:02:32.490> and<00:02:33.050> for<00:02:34.050> example

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:34.410 
set the maximum length and for example

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:38.270 
set the maximum length and for example
grow<00:02:34.740> has<00:02:35.190> based<00:02:35.820> on<00:02:36.060> that<00:02:36.270> now<00:02:37.230> I<00:02:37.560> women

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:38.280 
grow has based on that now I women

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.860 
grow has based on that now I women
delves<00:02:38.820> options<00:02:39.270> and<00:02:39.600> now<00:02:39.630> there's<00:02:41.780> there<00:02:42.780> are

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
delves options and now there's there are

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:48.110 
delves options and now there's there are
options<00:02:43.020> to<00:02:43.380> use<00:02:43.650> at<00:02:43.860> the<00:02:43.890> end<00:02:44.430> time<00:02:46.790> that<00:02:47.790> the

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
options to use at the end time that the

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.290 
options to use at the end time that the
paths<00:02:48.660> are<00:02:49.020> drawn<00:02:49.410> to<00:02:49.640> or<00:02:50.640> you<00:02:50.970> can<00:02:51.120> also

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.300 
paths are drawn to or you can also

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.340 
paths are drawn to or you can also
change<00:02:51.930> the<00:02:52.080> starting<00:02:52.709> time<00:02:54.020> of<00:02:55.020> course

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
change the starting time of course

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:58.720 
change the starting time of course
design<00:02:55.830> metal<00:02:56.400> so<00:02:56.670> you<00:02:56.730> can<00:02:57.030> grow<00:02:57.510> hair<00:02:57.810> or

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
design metal so you can grow hair or

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.120 
design metal so you can grow hair or
that<00:02:59.730> the<00:02:59.940> random<00:03:00.239> length<00:03:00.630> and<00:03:00.900> now<00:03:01.890> you<00:03:01.950> can

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.130 
that the random length and now you can

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.030 
that the random length and now you can
see<00:03:02.160> that<00:03:02.340> before<00:03:03.470> setting<00:03:04.470> the<00:03:04.680> random

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.040 
see that before setting the random

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.910 
see that before setting the random
lengths<00:03:05.250> for<00:03:05.550> parent<00:03:06.560> particles<00:03:07.560> wouldn't

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
lengths for parent particles wouldn't

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:11.590 
lengths for parent particles wouldn't
push<00:03:08.190> it<00:03:08.220> possible<00:03:08.910> but<00:03:09.150> now<00:03:09.390> it<00:03:09.540> was<00:03:09.720> too<00:03:10.049> and

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:11.600 
push it possible but now it was too and

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.289 
push it possible but now it was too and
there's<00:03:12.600> also<00:03:12.989> an<00:03:13.769> option<00:03:14.160> for<00:03:14.299> absolute

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:15.299 
there's also an option for absolute

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:21.380 
there's also an option for absolute
timing<00:03:15.950> where<00:03:16.950> the<00:03:17.160> times<00:03:17.519> are<00:03:17.820> in<00:03:18.120> frames<00:03:20.390> it

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
timing where the times are in frames it

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:23.600 
timing where the times are in frames it
doesn't<00:03:21.720> do<00:03:21.840> very<00:03:22.200> much<00:03:22.440> for<00:03:22.769> hair<00:03:23.100> particle

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
doesn't do very much for hair particle

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:26.390 
doesn't do very much for hair particle
seams<00:03:23.910> or<00:03:24.269> pair<00:03:24.840> particles<00:03:25.350> are<00:03:25.680> born<00:03:26.040> on

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:26.400 
seams or pair particles are born on

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:33.970 
seams or pair particles are born on
frame<00:03:27.170> 0<00:03:28.170> and<00:03:28.940> they<00:03:29.940> die<00:03:30.180> on<00:03:30.570> the<00:03:30.810> brain<00:03:31.080> 100

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
frame 0 and they die on the brain 100

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:38.630 
frame 0 and they die on the brain 100
now<00:03:34.980> we<00:03:35.580> get<00:03:35.730> to<00:03:36.000> the<00:03:36.120> nice<00:03:36.299> part<00:03:36.720> that<00:03:37.220> if<00:03:38.220> we

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:38.640 
now we get to the nice part that if we

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:43.130 
now we get to the nice part that if we
set<00:03:39.030> the<00:03:39.950> particle<00:03:40.950> system<00:03:41.459> type<00:03:41.730> to<00:03:42.140> normal

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
set the particle system type to normal

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:47.509 
set the particle system type to normal
particles<00:03:43.709> and<00:03:44.570> bake<00:03:45.570> the<00:03:45.780> simulation<00:03:46.560> then

00:03:47.509 --> 00:03:47.519 
particles and bake the simulation then

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:51.259 
particles and bake the simulation then
we<00:03:48.120> can<00:03:48.269> also<00:03:49.010> use<00:03:50.010> the<00:03:50.160> same<00:03:50.400> options<00:03:50.910> and

00:03:51.259 --> 00:03:51.269 
we can also use the same options and

00:03:51.269 --> 00:03:54.430 
we can also use the same options and
visualize<00:03:52.110> it<00:03:52.320> view<00:03:52.560> the<00:03:53.130> particle<00:03:53.730> parts

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:54.440 
visualize it view the particle parts

00:03:54.440 --> 00:04:02.390 
visualize it view the particle parts
using<00:03:55.440> the<00:03:55.799> crap<00:03:56.690> utilization<00:03:58.010> and<00:03:59.330> also<00:04:01.400> will

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:02.400 
using the crap utilization and also will

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:06.350 
using the crap utilization and also will
the<00:04:02.989> particle<00:04:03.989> paths<00:04:04.430> but<00:04:05.430> now<00:04:05.730> we<00:04:06.239> actually

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:06.360 
the particle paths but now we actually

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.780 
the particle paths but now we actually
see<00:04:06.840> a<00:04:06.870> difference<00:04:07.440> to<00:04:07.950> the<00:04:08.070> hair<00:04:08.220> particles

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:08.790 
see a difference to the hair particles

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:12.319 
see a difference to the hair particles
when<00:04:09.510> we<00:04:09.780> set<00:04:09.959> the<00:04:10.200> absolute<00:04:10.980> of<00:04:11.549> timing

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:12.329 
when we set the absolute of timing

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:15.460 
when we set the absolute of timing
because<00:04:13.050> the<00:04:13.530> particles<00:04:13.830> are<00:04:14.190> born<00:04:14.520> at

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:15.470 
because the particles are born at

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:20.350 
because the particles are born at
different<00:04:15.860> times<00:04:16.209> you<00:04:17.209> see<00:04:17.420> that<00:04:17.600> the<00:04:19.360> past

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:20.360 
different times you see that the past

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:23.890 
different times you see that the past
also<00:04:21.460> start<00:04:22.460> growing<00:04:22.850> at<00:04:23.120> different<00:04:23.180> times

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:23.900 
also start growing at different times

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:28.690 
also start growing at different times
and<00:04:24.370> by<00:04:25.370> animating<00:04:25.940> these<00:04:26.330> values<00:04:27.670> you<00:04:28.670> can

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:28.700 
and by animating these values you can

00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:32.740 
and by animating these values you can
achieve<00:04:29.030> some<00:04:29.540> quite<00:04:29.960> nice<00:04:30.280> effects<00:04:31.720> you<00:04:32.720> can

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:32.750 
achieve some quite nice effects you can

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:35.820 
achieve some quite nice effects you can
a<00:04:33.020> bottle<00:04:33.410> of<00:04:33.440> course<00:04:33.740> at<00:04:33.920> the<00:04:34.190> end<00:04:34.970> and<00:04:35.180> time

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:35.830 
a bottle of course at the end and time

00:04:35.830 --> 00:04:40.960 
a bottle of course at the end and time
and<00:04:37.120> the<00:04:38.120> absolute<00:04:38.540> part<00:04:39.200> timing<00:04:39.830> and<00:04:40.520> uses

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:40.970 
and the absolute part timing and uses

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:46.360 
and the absolute part timing and uses
the<00:04:41.770> particle<00:04:42.770> lifetime<00:04:43.190> and<00:04:44.260> it<00:04:45.370> doesn't

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:46.370 
the particle lifetime and it doesn't

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:48.850 
the particle lifetime and it doesn't
take<00:04:46.700> into<00:04:46.880> account<00:04:47.150> be<00:04:47.450> different<00:04:47.990> times<00:04:48.230> to

00:04:48.850 --> 00:04:48.860 
take into account be different times to

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:57.520 
take into account be different times to
party<00:04:49.130> awesome<00:04:53.290> hmm<00:04:54.290> again<00:04:55.100> it's<00:04:56.110> let's<00:04:57.110> free

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:57.530 
party awesome hmm again it's let's free

00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:00.760 
party awesome hmm again it's let's free
baked<00:04:58.210> and<00:04:59.210> then<00:04:59.540> look<00:04:59.780> at<00:04:59.900> some<00:05:00.140> new<00:05:00.380> options

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:00.770 
baked and then look at some new options

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:05.620 
baked and then look at some new options
in<00:05:01.550> the<00:05:02.510> halo<00:05:03.310> visualization<00:05:04.310> and<00:05:05.240> here<00:05:05.510> we

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:05.630 
in the halo visualization and here we

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:09.370 
in the halo visualization and here we
have<00:05:06.850> let's<00:05:07.850> just<00:05:07.970> seen<00:05:08.630> with<00:05:08.810> some<00:05:09.080> the

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:09.380 
have let's just seen with some the

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:11.980 
have let's just seen with some the
particles<00:05:09.860> forwards<00:05:10.580> we<00:05:11.570> have<00:05:11.750> a<00:05:11.780> new

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:11.990 
particles forwards we have a new

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:16.480 
particles forwards we have a new
optioned<00:05:12.970> tray<00:05:13.970> account<00:05:14.740> I'm<00:05:15.740> not<00:05:15.950> sure<00:05:16.010> yet

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:16.490 
optioned tray account I'm not sure yet

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:22.360 
optioned tray account I'm not sure yet
of<00:05:16.850> the<00:05:17.890> naming<00:05:18.890> but<00:05:19.430> it<00:05:20.210> will<00:05:20.360> do<00:05:20.540> for<00:05:20.570> now<00:05:21.370> so

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:22.370 
of the naming but it will do for now so

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:25.390 
of the naming but it will do for now so
what<00:05:22.550> we<00:05:22.700> can<00:05:22.910> do<00:05:23.060> is<00:05:23.300> create<00:05:24.260> instances<00:05:24.890> of

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:25.400 
what we can do is create instances of

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:32.280 
what we can do is create instances of
the<00:05:25.669> particles<00:05:26.480> along<00:05:26.840> the<00:05:27.020> part<00:05:28.240> or<00:05:29.240> actually

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:32.290 

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:36.460 

backwards<00:05:33.290> from<00:05:33.620> the<00:05:33.890> current<00:05:34.520> position<00:05:35.470> and

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:36.470 
backwards from the current position and

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:40.030 
backwards from the current position and
there<00:05:36.680> you<00:05:36.890> follow<00:05:37.190> along<00:05:37.520> nicely<00:05:38.800> let's<00:05:39.800> set

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:40.040 
there you follow along nicely let's set

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:43.480 
there you follow along nicely let's set
some<00:05:40.340> grad<00:05:41.090> T<00:05:41.440> so<00:05:42.440> we<00:05:42.560> can<00:05:42.740> see<00:05:42.979> the<00:05:43.190> effect

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:43.490 
some grad T so we can see the effect

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:49.300 
some grad T so we can see the effect
better<00:05:43.820> now<00:05:45.850> they<00:05:46.850> all<00:05:47.060> got<00:05:47.300> quite<00:05:47.600> nicely<00:05:48.310> and

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:49.310 
better now they all got quite nicely and

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:53.469 
better now they all got quite nicely and
we<00:05:49.640> can<00:05:49.850> set<00:05:50.060> the<00:05:50.590> how<00:05:51.590> many<00:05:51.800> particles<00:05:52.130> are<00:05:52.580> in

00:05:53.469 --> 00:05:53.479 
we can set the how many particles are in

00:05:53.479 --> 00:05:58.240 
we can set the how many particles are in
the<00:05:54.229> trail<00:05:55.240> how<00:05:56.240> long<00:05:56.660> the<00:05:56.900> tray<00:05:57.110> lists<00:05:57.590> and<00:05:57.890> we

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:58.250 
the trail how long the tray lists and we

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:04.719 
the trail how long the tray lists and we
randomize<00:05:59.090> that<00:06:00.370> and<00:06:01.370> we<00:06:01.760> can<00:06:01.910> also<00:06:02.030> set<00:06:03.729> this

00:06:04.719 --> 00:06:04.729 
randomize that and we can also set this

00:06:04.729 --> 00:06:07.420 
randomize that and we can also set this
length<00:06:05.000> is<00:06:05.560> relative<00:06:06.560> to<00:06:06.590> the<00:06:06.890> particle

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:07.430 
length is relative to the particle

00:06:07.430 --> 00:06:10.090 
length is relative to the particle
lifetime<00:06:07.970> but<00:06:08.210> we<00:06:08.390> can<00:06:08.540> also<00:06:08.660> set<00:06:09.440> in<00:06:09.710> frames

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:10.100 
lifetime but we can also set in frames

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:13.270 
lifetime but we can also set in frames
to<00:06:10.640> whether<00:06:11.240> we<00:06:11.479> like<00:06:11.690> so<00:06:12.620> even<00:06:12.950> though<00:06:12.979> the

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:13.280 
to whether we like so even though the

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:19.060 
to whether we like so even though the
particles<00:06:14.060> are<00:06:14.300> now<00:06:14.660> I<00:06:15.160> think<00:06:16.160> 50<00:06:16.610> frames<00:06:18.070> and

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:19.070 
particles are now I think 50 frames and

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:21.610 
particles are now I think 50 frames and
they<00:06:19.220> are<00:06:19.400> alive<00:06:19.760> for<00:06:20.180> 50<00:06:20.540> frames<00:06:20.750> then<00:06:21.169> we<00:06:21.410> can

00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:21.620 
they are alive for 50 frames then we can

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:25.270 
they are alive for 50 frames then we can
have<00:06:21.770> the<00:06:22.419> trailer<00:06:23.419> skill<00:06:23.930> on<00:06:24.200> and<00:06:24.500> on

00:06:25.270 --> 00:06:25.280 
have the trailer skill on and on

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:31.900 
have the trailer skill on and on
or<00:06:26.139> however<00:06:27.139> one<00:06:27.770> we<00:06:27.950> like<00:06:29.920> and<00:06:30.920> this<00:06:31.670> also

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:31.910 
or however one we like and this also

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:37.690 
or however one we like and this also
works<00:06:32.330> for<00:06:32.510> the<00:06:33.250> line<00:06:34.250> deserved<00:06:34.730> actions<00:06:36.700> so

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:37.700 
works for the line deserved actions so

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:41.560 
works for the line deserved actions so
that<00:06:37.730> quite<00:06:38.360> some<00:06:38.600> nice<00:06:39.790> things<00:06:40.790> possible<00:06:41.330> now

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:41.570 
that quite some nice things possible now

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:45.850 
that quite some nice things possible now
that<00:06:41.750> to<00:06:42.290> really<00:06:42.590> want<00:06:42.770> people<00:06:44.650> but<00:06:45.650> one

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:45.860 
that to really want people but one

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:49.990 
that to really want people but one
really<00:06:46.220> nice<00:06:46.340> thing<00:06:46.400> is<00:06:47.320> if<00:06:48.320> we<00:06:49.130> activate

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:50.000 
really nice thing is if we activate

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.879 
really nice thing is if we activate
children<00:06:52.330> for<00:06:53.330> the<00:06:53.419> particles<00:06:54.050> with<00:06:54.650> the

00:06:54.879 --> 00:06:54.889 
children for the particles with the

00:06:54.889 --> 00:06:58.600 
children for the particles with the
tribes<00:06:55.280> showing<00:06:56.350> and<00:06:57.350> then<00:06:57.380> we<00:06:57.950> change<00:06:58.280> some
