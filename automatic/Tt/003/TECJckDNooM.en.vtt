00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
me a long time ago was that maybe we

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.129 
me a long time ago was that maybe we
shouldn't<00:00:14.580> call<00:00:14.730> them<00:00:14.880> quick<00:00:15.269> stops<00:00:15.570> maybe<00:00:16.049> we

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
shouldn't call them quick stops maybe we

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.680 
shouldn't call them quick stops maybe we
should<00:00:16.289> call<00:00:16.500> them<00:00:16.590> slow<00:00:16.920> stops<00:00:17.690> typical

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
should call them slow stops typical

get ready to initiate the quick stop and
they<00:00:24.930> go<00:00:25.050> one<00:00:25.260> two<00:00:25.560> three<00:00:25.590> quick<00:00:26.099> stop<00:00:26.340> and

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:26.609 
they go one two three quick stop and

00:00:26.609 --> 00:00:29.450 
they go one two three quick stop and
because<00:00:27.570> it's<00:00:27.720> called<00:00:28.019> quick<00:00:28.260> stop<00:00:28.500> they<00:00:29.099> yank

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
because it's called quick stop they yank

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.630 
because it's called quick stop they yank
the<00:00:29.609> cyclic<00:00:30.029> back<00:00:30.269> pull<00:00:31.199> it<00:00:31.349> back<00:00:31.560> put<00:00:32.430> a<00:00:32.460> great

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
the cyclic back pull it back put a great

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.670 
the cyclic back pull it back put a great
big<00:00:32.790> flare<00:00:33.030> on<00:00:33.090> it<00:00:33.480> they<00:00:33.660> jerk<00:00:34.020> the<00:00:34.200> collective

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
big flare on it they jerk the collective

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.459 
big flare on it they jerk the collective
well<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:35.579> point<00:00:35.760> is<00:00:35.940> it's<00:00:36.300> a<00:00:36.450> slow<00:00:36.750> stop<00:00:37.079> it's

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469 
well the point is it's a slow stop it's

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:38.930 
well the point is it's a slow stop it's
not<00:00:37.680> a<00:00:37.710> quick<00:00:37.950> stop<00:00:38.129> doesn't<00:00:38.460> mean<00:00:38.550> you<00:00:38.670> jerk

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:38.940 
not a quick stop doesn't mean you jerk

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:40.880 
not a quick stop doesn't mean you jerk
the<00:00:39.090> controls<00:00:39.510> you<00:00:39.690> slow<00:00:40.020> slowly<00:00:40.590> D

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 
the controls you slow slowly D

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.639 
the controls you slow slowly D
accelerate<00:00:41.430> the<00:00:41.579> helicopter<00:00:42.300> but<00:00:43.050> don't<00:00:43.469> get

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
accelerate the helicopter but don't get

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:58.770 
accelerate the helicopter but don't get
it<00:00:43.800> too<00:00:43.980> aggressive<00:00:44.489> with<00:00:44.520> it

00:00:58.770 --> 00:00:58.780 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.500 

now<00:00:59.290> for<00:00:59.590> recycling<00:01:00.100> let's<00:01:01.030> get<00:01:01.210> him<00:01:01.330> back

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:01.510 
now for recycling let's get him back

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:03.570 
now for recycling let's get him back
right<00:01:01.810> so<00:01:02.020> high<00:01:02.230> let's<00:01:02.830> try<00:01:03.040> more<00:01:03.190> like<00:01:03.250> this

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:03.580 
right so high let's try more like this

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:05.400 
right so high let's try more like this
I'm<00:01:03.760> gonna<00:01:03.880> I<00:01:04.059> got<00:01:04.239> the<00:01:04.330> controls<00:01:04.720> the<00:01:05.140> other

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:05.410 
I'm gonna I got the controls the other

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:07.440 
I'm gonna I got the controls the other
control<00:01:05.770> look<00:01:06.280> at<00:01:06.430> your<00:01:06.610> airspeed<00:01:06.910> in<00:01:07.330> your

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:07.450 
control look at your airspeed in your

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:08.190 
control look at your airspeed in your
altimeter

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:08.200 
altimeter

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.730 
altimeter
let's<00:01:08.830> do<00:01:08.979> about<00:01:09.190> like<00:01:09.580> more<00:01:09.820> like<00:01:09.940> 40<00:01:10.540> and<00:01:10.780> 40

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:11.740 
let's do about like more like 40 and 40

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.910 
let's do about like more like 40 and 40
something<00:01:12.100> like<00:01:12.190> this<00:01:12.400> 1<00:01:13.270> 2<00:01:13.300> 3<00:01:13.930> cooks<00:01:14.500> down<00:01:14.650> I

00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:14.920 
something like this 1 2 3 cooks down I

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:16.500 
something like this 1 2 3 cooks down I
don't<00:01:15.340> really<00:01:15.580> want<00:01:15.729> to<00:01:15.760> be<00:01:15.850> that<00:01:16.000> high<00:01:16.240> when

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:16.510 
don't really want to be that high when

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:18.630 
don't really want to be that high when
you<00:01:16.600> do<00:01:16.720> it<00:01:17.040> that's<00:01:18.040> what<00:01:18.160> we<00:01:18.220> did<00:01:18.310> last<00:01:18.369> time

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:18.640 
you do it that's what we did last time

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.219 
you do it that's what we did last time
we<00:01:18.940> did<00:01:19.030> want<00:01:19.210> to<00:01:19.240> put<00:01:19.360> down<00:01:19.510> there<00:01:19.750> I<00:01:19.780> can<00:01:20.080> show

00:01:20.219 --> 00:01:20.229 
we did want to put down there I can show

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:29.430 
we did want to put down there I can show
you<00:01:20.290> on<00:01:20.380> the<00:01:20.530> video<00:01:20.680> we<00:01:21.670> were<00:01:21.820> way<00:01:22.030> I<00:01:24.570> I<00:01:28.440> just

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:29.440 
you on the video we were way I I just

you on the video we were way I I just
want<00:01:29.860> to<00:01:29.920> add<00:01:30.070> to<00:01:30.310> the<00:01:30.400> end<00:01:30.580> of<00:01:30.759> this<00:01:30.880> one

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:31.119 
want to add to the end of this one

want to add to the end of this one
there's<00:01:32.050> a<00:01:32.110> million<00:01:32.530> ways<00:01:33.009> of<00:01:33.280> doing<00:01:33.399> quick

00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:33.759 
there's a million ways of doing quick

00:01:33.759 --> 00:01:37.350 
there's a million ways of doing quick
stop's<00:01:34.140> guys<00:01:35.140> teach<00:01:35.470> them<00:01:36.119> tons<00:01:37.119> of<00:01:37.270> different

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:37.360 
stop's guys teach them tons of different

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.590 
stop's guys teach them tons of different
ways<00:01:37.979> it<00:01:38.979> doesn't<00:01:39.340> mean<00:01:39.490> one<00:01:39.700> person<00:01:40.119> one

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:40.600 
ways it doesn't mean one person one

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:41.820 
ways it doesn't mean one person one
instructor<00:01:41.080> is<00:01:41.170> right<00:01:41.440> over<00:01:41.590> another

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:41.830 
instructor is right over another

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:44.160 
instructor is right over another
instructor<00:01:42.340> again<00:01:43.330> depends<00:01:43.780> on<00:01:43.899> their

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:44.170 
instructor again depends on their

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.260 
instructor again depends on their
condition<00:01:44.619> what<00:01:45.009> you're<00:01:45.190> flying<00:01:45.670> the

00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:46.270 
condition what you're flying the

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:48.029 
condition what you're flying the
maneuver<00:01:46.690> still<00:01:46.930> basically<00:01:47.259> done<00:01:47.590> the<00:01:47.619> same

00:01:48.029 --> 00:01:48.039 
maneuver still basically done the same

00:01:48.039 --> 00:01:50.820 
maneuver still basically done the same
it's<00:01:48.340> just<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:49.420> method<00:01:49.750> of<00:01:49.840> guys<00:01:50.050> do<00:01:50.470> it<00:01:50.649> as

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:50.830 
it's just the method of guys do it as

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.850 
it's just the method of guys do it as
far<00:01:51.070> as<00:01:51.100> when<00:01:51.970> to<00:01:52.090> pull<00:01:52.270> collective<00:01:52.869> can<00:01:53.770> you

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:53.860 
far as when to pull collective can you

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:55.230 
far as when to pull collective can you
pull<00:01:54.039> it<00:01:54.070> during<00:01:54.369> the<00:01:54.490> flare<00:01:54.789> do<00:01:55.030> you<00:01:55.090> wait

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:55.240 
pull it during the flare do you wait

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.420 
pull it during the flare do you wait
until<00:01:55.390> you<00:01:55.570> level<00:01:55.750> the<00:01:55.930> aircraft<00:01:56.410> I'm<00:01:57.250> not

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:57.430 
until you level the aircraft I'm not

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:58.680 
until you level the aircraft I'm not
going<00:01:57.550> to<00:01:57.610> go<00:01:57.700> into<00:01:57.850> all<00:01:57.970> that<00:01:58.149> because<00:01:58.330> that

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:58.690 
going to go into all that because that

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:00.330 
going to go into all that because that
really<00:01:58.930> does<00:01:59.050> depend<00:01:59.350> on<00:01:59.740> a<00:01:59.770> way<00:02:00.039> guys

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:00.340 
really does depend on a way guys

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.179 
really does depend on a way guys
teaching<00:02:00.940> and<00:02:01.119> there's<00:02:01.990> so<00:02:02.289> many<00:02:02.500> ways<00:02:02.799> to<00:02:03.040> do

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:03.189 
teaching and there's so many ways to do

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:05.820 
teaching and there's so many ways to do
a<00:02:03.220> quick<00:02:03.490> stop<00:02:03.729> that<00:02:04.380> there's<00:02:05.380> a<00:02:05.439> million<00:02:05.619> ways
