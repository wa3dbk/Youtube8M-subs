00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.020
 we are at the quick con pavilion 

00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:07.200
 alfonso peduto the vice-president 

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:12.389
 the company is a leading company in 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:14.790
 italy for winches for lamps 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:17.310
 for water heater 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.800
 for now also the rast bots is 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.960
 a company that exists on the market from 

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:23.340
 a long time and that to products of 

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.109
 excellence 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.570
 then here we have a very product 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.550
 interesting that he is a botmaster who wants to 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.309
 say a bow thruster you need for 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.500
 move the boat in maneuver that has 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:38.190
 of the particular characteristics there 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:40.950
 stories a little alfonso yes this is a bit 

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.559
 transfer in the backward version which 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:45.600
 we developed especially for per 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.730
 sailboats with the characteristic of 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.520
 have all the electronic parts 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:54.530
 electric inside the boat on a 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:57.989
 its container made of material 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:00.239
 special a composite material and the 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:03.960
 moving parts inside 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:06.990
 water only remains the reducer for 

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:10.530
 which all the parts can be inspected is 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:12.119
 subject to easy maintenance 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.430
 let's say an important thing that the 

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:17.159
 made to be retractable allows 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.380
 allelic to disappear inside the 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:21.960
 hull when not used then 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.490
 this at the hydrodynamic level mentioned 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.979
 absolutely no advantages 

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:28.200
 no hydrodynamic problem 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.869
 the hull lines are restored 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.250
 exactly how they were born exactly and then 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:36.340
 the important thing is that there is this 

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:38.590
 we make casing that is inserted 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.390
 inside the boat that is 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:43.000
 absolutely perfectly ponds 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:45.010
 tin and this prevents them from being there 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.830
 infiltrations because as you see def 

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:50.830
 launched in a very absolute manner 

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:53.080
 also all the peculiarities of this 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:55.150
 unusual is the casing is that all 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:02:00.630
 supporting mechanical components 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:02:02.950
 of the entire system are merged together 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.290
 to wally with the plastic therefore not 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:07.660
 you don't see screws outside of it 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:10.479
 fixing of all the parts that 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:12.670
 support the movement of the transfer ox 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:15.010
 and then another important thing 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:19.570
 that the parts immersed that is what is 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:23.040
 within this envelope are the parts 

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:23.040
 moving and cohesive moving parts 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:28.090
 of the moving parts the motor is the 

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:30.989
 mechanism is all out of the water 

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:33.130
 therefore only the propeller is in the water 

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:34.600
 exactly it was only in the liga with 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:38.380
 reducer that not all made in 

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:40.810
 bronze and steel material all 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:43.420
 the free smi that can be seen if there 

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:45.700
 let's see how it works we are in 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:49.209
 a navigation situation we say 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:51.610
 that we are coming to the port and then to 

00:02:49.209 --> 00:02:55.840
 this point for the maneuver we activate there 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:58.810
 we pull out either by acting with one 

00:02:55.840 --> 00:03:00.549
 press a 2 second on the key 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:02.260
 switch on at this point the whole 

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:05.500
 mechanism starts moving 

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:07.690
 The propeller out s completely once 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:11.380
 that the propeller has leaked can be operated 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:13.600
 with joystick go left and right 

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:15.970
 our characteristic that succeeded us 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:18.700
 we have an imposed time on the propeller that 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:21.040
 stay out of the water for six minutes 

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:22.390
 since the last operation 

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:25.810
 this to prevent someone from doing it 

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:27.870
 forget to close it and she and you 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:30.810
 sail with the boat in 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:33.450
 here are many Catholics here 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:35.580
 where there is this plate is attacked 

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:38.159
 the part of the hull that is cut 

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:41.299
 which is cut and which therefore for 

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:45.840
 restore the lines of the hull 

00:03:41.299 --> 00:03:47.549
 let's see how it works then yes not now 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.140
 there is the power cream there is no part 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:51.000
 of connected power so we don't 

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:53.549
 we manage to make it run also because 

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:58.470
 it would be dangerous here at the fair that 

00:03:53.549 --> 00:04:00.000
 someone is okay then 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:02.310
 in short, the characteristics of this 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:05.489
 product is that easy accessibility 

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:08.790
 to the parts to the mechanical parts and then 

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:13.579
 after the casing is perfectly sealed 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:13.579
 and very robust especially thanks a lot
