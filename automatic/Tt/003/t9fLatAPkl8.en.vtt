today's<00:00:00.989> how<00:00:01.260> to<00:00:01.319> build<00:00:01.589> is<00:00:01.860> on<00:00:01.890> this<00:00:02.220> robot

00:00:02.629 --> 00:00:02.639 
today's how to build is on this robot

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:07.150 
today's how to build is on this robot
suit

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:07.160 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.310 

so<00:00:08.160> this<00:00:08.670> how<00:00:08.910> to<00:00:08.970> build<00:00:09.270> is<00:00:09.510> again<00:00:09.840> an<00:00:10.110> example

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320 
so this how to build is again an example

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.140 
so this how to build is again an example
of<00:00:10.860> something<00:00:11.100> that's<00:00:11.250> not<00:00:11.490> part<00:00:11.700> of<00:00:12.090> the

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
of something that's not part of the

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:13.879 
of something that's not part of the
nightly<00:00:12.480> news<00:00:12.540> at<00:00:12.780> nine<00:00:12.930> series<00:00:13.559> but

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
have made a creation that I hope fits

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:22.490 
have made a creation that I hope fits
their<00:00:18.420> needs<00:00:19.250> so<00:00:20.250> this<00:00:20.760> robot<00:00:20.970> suit<00:00:21.420> to<00:00:22.230> start

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500 
their needs so this robot suit to start

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.759 
their needs so this robot suit to start
out<00:00:23.029> 1<00:00:24.029> by<00:00:24.060> 3<00:00:24.449> plate<00:00:24.689> here<00:00:25.789> three<00:00:26.789> of<00:00:27.300> the

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
brick with studs on three sides I could

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.250 
brick with studs on three sides I could
get<00:01:02.609> this<00:01:02.789> off<00:01:03.000> ok<00:01:03.830> so<00:01:05.120> that<00:01:06.140> relatively<00:01:07.140> new

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
putting them on the two sides put the

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.640 
putting them on the two sides put the
whole<00:01:16.530> end<00:01:16.890> towards<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:17.490> back<00:01:18.350> like<00:01:19.350> that<00:01:19.380> and

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:19.650 
whole end towards the back like that and

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.720 
whole end towards the back like that and
then<00:01:19.950> I've<00:01:20.160> got<00:01:20.400> a<00:01:20.430> 2<00:01:20.820> by<00:01:21.000> 2<00:01:21.320> printed<00:01:22.460> tile<00:01:23.460> that

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:23.730 
then I've got a 2 by 2 printed tile that

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:27.730 
then I've got a 2 by 2 printed tile that
I'm<00:01:23.880> putting<00:01:24.090> there<00:01:24.530> make<00:01:25.530> the<00:01:25.650> front<00:01:25.890> cool

00:01:27.730 --> 00:01:27.740 
I'm putting there make the front cool

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:33.080 
I'm putting there make the front cool
now<00:01:28.740> for<00:01:29.010> the<00:01:29.100> leg<00:01:29.340> piece<00:01:29.670> down<00:01:29.970> here<00:01:31.790> this<00:01:32.790> is

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
now for the leg piece down here this is

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.780 
now for the leg piece down here this is
a<00:01:34.670> one<00:01:35.670> by<00:01:35.850> one<00:01:36.150> with<00:01:37.110> studs<00:01:37.470> on<00:01:37.650> two<00:01:38.010> sides<00:01:38.280> and

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
a one by one with studs on two sides and

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.780 
a one by one with studs on two sides and
I've<00:01:39.720> shoved<00:01:40.260> a<00:01:40.440> light<00:01:40.770> saber<00:01:41.010> blade<00:01:41.370> through

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.100 
I've shoved a light saber blade through
it<00:01:42.740> and<00:01:43.740> centered<00:01:44.190> that

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110 
it and centered that

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:52.280 
it and centered that
and<00:01:46.200> then<00:01:49.790> connect<00:01:50.790> that<00:01:50.850> on<00:01:51.090> the<00:01:51.240> bottom<00:01:51.630> I'll

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
and then connect that on the bottom I'll

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:53.890 
and then connect that on the bottom I'll
show<00:01:52.500> you<00:01:52.590> how<00:01:52.710> to<00:01:52.770> build<00:01:52.980> this<00:01:53.190> leg<00:01:53.430> right<00:01:53.700> now

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:53.900 
show you how to build this leg right now

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:58.960 
show you how to build this leg right now
so<00:01:54.900> the<00:01:55.020> leg<00:01:55.670> it's<00:01:56.670> built<00:01:57.030> out<00:01:57.210> of<00:01:57.270> this<00:01:57.600> piece

00:01:58.960 --> 00:01:58.970 
so the leg it's built out of this piece

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:04.790 
so the leg it's built out of this piece
this<00:01:59.970> piece<00:02:00.150> and<00:02:01.160> this<00:02:02.160> piece<00:02:02.220> so<00:02:03.590> they<00:02:04.590> go

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:04.800 
this piece and this piece so they go

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:10.880 
this piece and this piece so they go
like<00:02:05.040> this<00:02:05.280> that<00:02:06.200> goes<00:02:07.200> like<00:02:07.290> that<00:02:09.470> and<00:02:10.470> put<00:02:10.860> it

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
like this that goes like that and put it

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:14.330 
like this that goes like that and put it
on<00:02:11.130> the<00:02:11.490> leg<00:02:12.030> socket<00:02:12.740> and<00:02:13.740> then<00:02:13.830> you<00:02:14.040> build

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.340 
on the leg socket and then you build

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:15.410 
on the leg socket and then you build
another<00:02:14.610> one<00:02:14.790> that<00:02:14.940> goes<00:02:15.120> in<00:02:15.270> the<00:02:15.330> other

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
another one that goes in the other

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:21.440 
another one that goes in the other
direction<00:02:15.540> and<00:02:16.670> I<00:02:17.870> put<00:02:18.870> it<00:02:18.960> on<00:02:19.080> backwards<00:02:20.450> we

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:21.450 
direction and I put it on backwards we

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:29.360 
direction and I put it on backwards we
go<00:02:23.959> now<00:02:24.959> for<00:02:24.990> the<00:02:25.350> arms<00:02:26.480> doing<00:02:27.480> a<00:02:27.630> cone<00:02:28.280> and<00:02:29.280> I

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
go now for the arms doing a cone and I

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.150 
go now for the arms doing a cone and I
wanted<00:02:29.580> this<00:02:29.760> piece<00:02:30.120> and<00:02:30.510> a<00:02:31.050> little<00:02:31.320> grabby

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:32.160 
wanted this piece and a little grabby

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:41.350 
wanted this piece and a little grabby
hand<00:02:32.900> there

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:41.360 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:46.880 

and<00:02:42.360> then<00:02:42.810> for<00:02:43.770> the<00:02:43.860> head<00:02:44.100> here<00:02:44.720> I've<00:02:45.720> got<00:02:45.930> a<00:02:45.959> 1

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
and then for the head here I've got a 1

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:51.800 
and then for the head here I've got a 1
by<00:02:47.040> 1<00:02:47.069> round<00:02:48.290> regular<00:02:49.290> head<00:02:50.330> just<00:02:51.330> chose<00:02:51.780> a
