in today's video I'd like to show you
how<00:00:13.320> to<00:00:13.380> create<00:00:13.740> mirror<00:00:14.519> images<00:00:15.240> of<00:00:15.269> your

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:16.020 
how to create mirror images of your

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.070 
how to create mirror images of your
stamps<00:00:16.740> on<00:00:16.920> your<00:00:17.570> cards<00:00:18.570> and<00:00:18.720> paper<00:00:18.960> craft

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080 
stamps on your cards and paper craft

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.859 
stamps on your cards and paper craft
projects<00:00:20.010> and<00:00:20.310> this<00:00:20.939> is<00:00:21.090> a<00:00:21.119> technique<00:00:21.600> that<00:00:21.660> I

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
projects and this is a technique that I

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.109 
projects and this is a technique that I
came<00:00:21.990> up<00:00:22.439> with<00:00:22.470> since<00:00:23.100> I<00:00:23.369> really<00:00:23.699> wanted<00:00:23.939> to

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119 
came up with since I really wanted to

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.779 
came up with since I really wanted to
give<00:00:24.269> this<00:00:24.449> heart<00:00:24.750> wings<00:00:25.140> but<00:00:25.949> all<00:00:26.189> I<00:00:26.220> had<00:00:26.550> was

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
give this heart wings but all I had was

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:29.179 
give this heart wings but all I had was
a<00:00:26.849> stamp<00:00:27.269> that<00:00:27.720> was<00:00:28.199> going<00:00:28.500> to<00:00:28.650> create<00:00:28.890> the

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
a stamp that was going to create the

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.669 
a stamp that was going to create the
wing<00:00:29.429> on<00:00:29.730> the<00:00:29.789> right<00:00:30.510> hand<00:00:30.750> side<00:00:30.990> and<00:00:31.320> I<00:00:31.410> didn't

00:00:31.669 --> 00:00:31.679 
wing on the right hand side and I didn't

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:33.350 
wing on the right hand side and I didn't
have<00:00:31.830> a<00:00:31.859> stamp<00:00:32.219> to<00:00:32.430> create<00:00:32.460> one<00:00:32.850> on<00:00:32.880> the<00:00:33.030> left

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
have a stamp to create one on the left

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.840 
have a stamp to create one on the left
so<00:00:34.020> I<00:00:34.050> had<00:00:34.380> to<00:00:34.500> come<00:00:34.649> up<00:00:34.680> with<00:00:34.770> a<00:00:34.920> way<00:00:35.160> to<00:00:35.370> be

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
so I had to come up with a way to be

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.000 
so I had to come up with a way to be
able<00:00:35.969> to<00:00:36.300> create<00:00:36.630> that<00:00:36.809> mirror<00:00:37.140> image<00:00:37.500> and<00:00:37.800> I'd

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
able to create that mirror image and I'd

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:39.770 
able to create that mirror image and I'd
like<00:00:38.160> to<00:00:38.219> share<00:00:38.700> with<00:00:38.879> you<00:00:39.030> the<00:00:39.210> technique<00:00:39.600> I

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780 
like to share with you the technique I

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.010 
like to share with you the technique I
came<00:00:40.140> up<00:00:40.290> with<00:00:41.210> for<00:00:42.210> this<00:00:42.360> project<00:00:42.600> we're

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:43.020

phaser<00:01:02.190> paper<00:01:02.460> so<00:01:02.820> I'm<00:01:02.910> just<00:01:03.090> going<00:01:03.270> to<00:01:03.359> cut

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
phaser paper so I'm just going to cut

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.530 
phaser paper so I'm just going to cut
that<00:01:03.960> off<00:01:04.019> and<00:01:04.530> put<00:01:04.619> this<00:01:05.040> aside<00:01:05.390> and<00:01:06.390> I'm

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
going to cut this down since there's

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.539 
going to cut this down since there's
plenty<00:01:08.880> here<00:01:08.909> for<00:01:09.390> a<00:01:09.930> couple<00:01:10.409> of<00:01:10.590> projects<00:01:11.220> so

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
plenty here for a couple of projects so

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.760 
plenty here for a couple of projects so
the<00:01:11.670> first<00:01:11.909> thing<00:01:12.090> we're<00:01:12.210> going<00:01:12.390> to<00:01:12.600> do<00:01:12.810> is<00:01:13.110> use

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770 
the first thing we're going to do is use

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.340 
the first thing we're going to do is use
this<00:01:14.250> language<00:01:14.640> of<00:01:15.030> friendship<00:01:15.600> stamp<00:01:16.020> and

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
this language of friendship stamp and

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.530 
this language of friendship stamp and
we're<00:01:16.500> going<00:01:16.710> to<00:01:16.799> stamp<00:01:17.130> our<00:01:17.430> first<00:01:17.790> wing<00:01:18.210> and

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
we're going to stamp our first wing and

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.899 
we're going to stamp our first wing and
that's<00:01:19.020> going<00:01:19.259> to<00:01:19.350> be<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.680> right<00:01:19.979> hand<00:01:20.400> wing

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
that's going to be the right hand wing

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.390 
that's going to be the right hand wing
so<00:01:21.570> we're<00:01:21.750> just<00:01:21.780> going<00:01:22.110> to<00:01:22.140> take<00:01:22.470> our<00:01:22.740> classic

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:23.400 
so we're just going to take our classic

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.210 
so we're just going to take our classic
basic<00:01:24.090> black<00:01:24.360> ink<00:01:24.720> and<00:01:25.020> we're<00:01:25.590> going<00:01:25.799> to<00:01:25.920> ink

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:26.220 
basic black ink and we're going to ink

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.160 
basic black ink and we're going to ink
up<00:01:26.430> that<00:01:26.490> wing<00:01:29.509> and<00:01:30.509> then<00:01:30.630> we're<00:01:30.810> just<00:01:30.840> going

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
up that wing and then we're just going

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:34.520 
up that wing and then we're just going
to<00:01:31.350> stamp<00:01:31.650> that<00:01:31.799> wing<00:01:32.310> onto<00:01:32.670> our<00:01:33.450> cardstock<00:01:33.810> so

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
to stamp that wing onto our cardstock so

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.399 
to stamp that wing onto our cardstock so
now<00:01:34.860> we<00:01:34.920> have<00:01:35.220> the<00:01:35.400> right<00:01:35.640> hand<00:01:36.000> wing<00:01:36.350> now<00:01:37.350> to

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
now we have the right hand wing now to

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:39.950 
now we have the right hand wing now to
get<00:01:37.740> the<00:01:37.920> left<00:01:38.220> handed<00:01:38.820> wing<00:01:39.090> we're<00:01:39.750> actually

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
get the left handed wing we're actually

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.920 
get the left handed wing we're actually
going<00:01:40.290> to<00:01:40.380> bring<00:01:40.680> in<00:01:40.890> our<00:01:41.159> freezer<00:01:41.790> paper<00:01:42.180> now

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
going to bring in our freezer paper now

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.450 
going to bring in our freezer paper now
one<00:01:43.140> thing<00:01:43.350> you'll<00:01:43.470> notice<00:01:43.680> about<00:01:44.009> freezer

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
one thing you'll notice about freezer

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.280 
one thing you'll notice about freezer
paper<00:01:44.759> that<00:01:45.060> might<00:01:45.240> be<00:01:45.360> a<00:01:45.390> little<00:01:45.659> difficult

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
paper that might be a little difficult

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.620 
paper that might be a little difficult
to<00:01:46.350> see<00:01:46.590> in<00:01:46.680> this<00:01:46.799> video<00:01:47.040> is<00:01:47.460> that<00:01:47.670> it<00:01:47.820> has<00:01:48.329> two

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
to see in this video is that it has two

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.139 
to see in this video is that it has two
different<00:01:48.780> textures<00:01:49.380> on<00:01:49.799> the<00:01:50.149> different

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
different textures on the different

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.020 
different textures on the different
sides<00:01:51.450> of<00:01:51.689> the<00:01:51.840> paper<00:01:52.140> so<00:01:52.950> on<00:01:53.250> one<00:01:53.490> side<00:01:53.790> it's

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
sides of the paper so on one side it's

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.300 
sides of the paper so on one side it's
got<00:01:54.240> kind<00:01:54.570> of<00:01:54.689> a<00:01:54.810> matte<00:01:55.110> finish<00:01:55.710> that<00:01:55.740> feels

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
got kind of a matte finish that feels

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.030 
got kind of a matte finish that feels
like<00:01:56.729> paper<00:01:57.060> and<00:01:57.540> on<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.259> other<00:01:58.380> side<00:01:58.770> it<00:01:59.009> has

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
like paper and on the other side it has

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:01.850 
like paper and on the other side it has
almost<00:01:59.610> a<00:01:59.759> wax<00:02:00.030> paper<00:02:00.420> feel<00:02:00.930> and<00:02:01.290> we're<00:02:01.740> going

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:01.860 
almost a wax paper feel and we're going

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:04.219 
almost a wax paper feel and we're going
to<00:02:01.890> be<00:02:02.070> working<00:02:02.490> with<00:02:02.640> this<00:02:02.850> waxed<00:02:03.420> paper<00:02:03.479> side

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
to be working with this waxed paper side

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:07.370 
to be working with this waxed paper side
so<00:02:05.040> we're<00:02:05.610> going<00:02:05.640> to<00:02:05.909> ink<00:02:06.119> up<00:02:06.299> our<00:02:06.479> stamp<00:02:06.570> once

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:07.380 
so we're going to ink up our stamp once

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.609 
so we're going to ink up our stamp once
again<00:02:07.740> so<00:02:08.069> inking<00:02:08.520> up<00:02:08.670> our<00:02:08.879> wing

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619 
again so inking up our wing

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:13.070 
again so inking up our wing
and<00:02:11.160> you<00:02:11.430> want<00:02:11.580> to<00:02:11.730> get<00:02:12.360> some<00:02:12.569> good<00:02:12.780> ink

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
and you want to get some good ink

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.110 
and you want to get some good ink
coverage<00:02:13.560> here<00:02:14.010> and<00:02:14.190> then<00:02:14.700> we're<00:02:14.849> going<00:02:15.000> to

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
coverage here and then we're going to

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:17.930 
coverage here and then we're going to
stamp<00:02:15.510> our<00:02:15.810> wing<00:02:16.140> straight<00:02:16.800> down<00:02:17.069> onto<00:02:17.400> our

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
stamp our wing straight down onto our

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:21.890 
stamp our wing straight down onto our
freezer<00:02:18.360> paper<00:02:18.780> and<00:02:20.060> lift<00:02:21.060> straight<00:02:21.390> up<00:02:21.450> and

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
freezer paper and lift straight up and

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.290 
freezer paper and lift straight up and
then<00:02:22.530> what<00:02:22.680> we're<00:02:22.830> going<00:02:23.099> to<00:02:23.129> do<00:02:23.430> is<00:02:23.670> turn<00:02:24.060> our

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:24.300 
then what we're going to do is turn our

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.720 
then what we're going to do is turn our
freezer<00:02:24.599> paper<00:02:24.930> over<00:02:25.620> onto<00:02:26.160> our<00:02:26.310> cardstock

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:26.730 
freezer paper over onto our cardstock

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.460 
freezer paper over onto our cardstock
and<00:02:27.299> we're<00:02:27.840> going<00:02:28.110> to<00:02:28.319> use<00:02:28.680> a<00:02:29.180> bone<00:02:30.180> folder<00:02:30.470> to

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
and we're going to use a bone folder to

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.000 
and we're going to use a bone folder to
burnish<00:02:32.030> that<00:02:33.030> stamped<00:02:33.599> image<00:02:33.989> onto<00:02:34.319> our

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.010 
burnish that stamped image onto our

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:40.220 
burnish that stamped image onto our
cardstock<00:02:37.640> and<00:02:39.019> once<00:02:40.019> you're<00:02:40.200> done

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:40.230 
cardstock and once you're done

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.770 
cardstock and once you're done
burnishing<00:02:41.010> you<00:02:41.280> just<00:02:41.519> pick<00:02:41.760> that<00:02:41.790> up<00:02:42.000> and<00:02:42.360> you

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.780 
burnishing you just pick that up and you

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.069 
burnishing you just pick that up and you
have<00:02:43.019> your<00:02:43.470> reverse<00:02:44.340> image<00:02:44.910> you'll<00:02:45.690> notice

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:46.079 
have your reverse image you'll notice

00:02:46.079 --> 00:02:47.990 
have your reverse image you'll notice
that<00:02:46.319> this<00:02:46.680> image<00:02:47.010> is<00:02:47.160> a<00:02:47.190> little<00:02:47.280> bit<00:02:47.670> lighter

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.000 
that this image is a little bit lighter

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.300 
that this image is a little bit lighter
in<00:02:48.329> color<00:02:48.750> than<00:02:48.900> the<00:02:49.380> original<00:02:49.950> one<00:02:50.160> we

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
in color than the original one we

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.819 
in color than the original one we
stamped<00:02:50.880> and<00:02:51.030> if<00:02:51.510> you<00:02:51.660> have<00:02:52.019> any<00:02:52.319> issues<00:02:52.799> with

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:52.829 
stamped and if you have any issues with

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:55.100 
stamped and if you have any issues with
that<00:02:53.130> what<00:02:53.400> you<00:02:53.519> can<00:02:53.730> do<00:02:53.970> is<00:02:54.239> just<00:02:54.810> take<00:02:55.079> your

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
that what you can do is just take your

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.569 
that what you can do is just take your
stamp<00:02:55.650> and<00:02:55.950> stamp<00:02:56.370> your<00:02:57.079> wing<00:02:58.079> again<00:02:58.620> since

00:02:59.569 --> 00:02:59.579 
stamp and stamp your wing again since

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:01.360 
stamp and stamp your wing again since
now<00:02:59.970> it's<00:03:00.209> at<00:03:00.390> half-strength

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370 
now it's at half-strength

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.589 
now it's at half-strength
since<00:03:02.370> the<00:03:02.489> first<00:03:02.700> time<00:03:02.910> we<00:03:03.060> stamped<00:03:03.420> it<00:03:03.510> it

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:03.599 
since the first time we stamped it it

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:05.479 
since the first time we stamped it it
was<00:03:03.720> at<00:03:03.840> full<00:03:04.049> strength<00:03:04.410> of<00:03:04.620> ink<00:03:04.799> now<00:03:05.160> it's<00:03:05.370> at

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
was at full strength of ink now it's at

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:07.729 
was at full strength of ink now it's at
half<00:03:05.670> strength<00:03:06.090> and<00:03:06.450> you<00:03:06.900> can<00:03:07.110> keep<00:03:07.470> stamping

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
half strength and you can keep stamping

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:09.860 
half strength and you can keep stamping
it<00:03:08.010> until<00:03:08.340> you<00:03:08.579> get<00:03:08.790> the<00:03:09.299> look<00:03:09.540> that<00:03:09.569> you

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
it until you get the look that you

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.660 
it until you get the look that you
really<00:03:10.319> like<00:03:10.560> so<00:03:10.860> that<00:03:11.010> might<00:03:11.190> actually<00:03:11.370> be

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:11.670 
really like so that might actually be

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.289 
really like so that might actually be
the<00:03:12.030> closest<00:03:12.870> kind<00:03:13.200> of<00:03:13.290> that<00:03:13.440> triple<00:03:14.030> stamp<00:03:15.030> or

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:15.299 
the closest kind of that triple stamp or

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:17.809 
the closest kind of that triple stamp or
at<00:03:15.389> one-third<00:03:16.019> strength<00:03:16.530> of<00:03:16.829> the<00:03:17.310> original

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:17.819 
at one-third strength of the original

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:20.090 
at one-third strength of the original
ink<00:03:18.090> and<00:03:18.389> then<00:03:18.900> we're<00:03:19.049> going<00:03:19.200> to<00:03:19.319> cut<00:03:19.680> out<00:03:19.889> our

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:20.100 
ink and then we're going to cut out our

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:30.500 
ink and then we're going to cut out our
wings<00:03:20.579> using<00:03:21.000> our<00:03:21.329> paper<00:03:21.510> snips<00:03:29.239> so<00:03:30.239> now<00:03:30.359> that

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:30.510 
wings using our paper snips so now that

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:32.599 
wings using our paper snips so now that
we<00:03:30.660> have<00:03:30.690> our<00:03:31.019> wings<00:03:31.200> cut<00:03:31.620> out<00:03:31.829> I'm<00:03:32.130> just<00:03:32.190> going

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:32.609 
we have our wings cut out I'm just going

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:34.970 
we have our wings cut out I'm just going
to<00:03:32.760> grab<00:03:32.970> the<00:03:33.209> heart-to-heart<00:03:33.840> punch<00:03:34.170> and<00:03:34.530> a

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
to grab the heart-to-heart punch and a

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.970 
to grab the heart-to-heart punch and a
scrap<00:03:35.310> of<00:03:35.630> cardstock<00:03:36.630> and<00:03:37.200> I'm<00:03:37.410> just<00:03:37.650> going<00:03:37.859> to

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:37.980 
scrap of cardstock and I'm just going to

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.050 
scrap of cardstock and I'm just going to
punch<00:03:38.220> this<00:03:38.549> long<00:03:38.880> skinny<00:03:39.239> heart<00:03:39.810> out<00:03:40.440> of<00:03:41.060> that

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
punch this long skinny heart out of that

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:47.180 
punch this long skinny heart out of that
punch<00:03:42.419> and<00:03:42.810> then<00:03:43.849> let's<00:03:44.849> see<00:03:45.209> I<00:03:45.569> think<00:03:46.190> guess

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:47.190 
punch and then let's see I think guess

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:48.680 
punch and then let's see I think guess
you<00:03:47.340> could<00:03:47.519> put<00:03:47.639> these<00:03:47.849> wings<00:03:48.120> on<00:03:48.329> the<00:03:48.419> front

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:48.690 
you could put these wings on the front

00:03:48.690 --> 00:03:51.050 
you could put these wings on the front
of<00:03:48.810> the<00:03:48.930> heart<00:03:49.169> or<00:03:49.410> behind<00:03:49.799> I<00:03:50.190> kind<00:03:50.760> of<00:03:50.849> like

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:51.060 
of the heart or behind I kind of like

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:53.479 
of the heart or behind I kind of like
them<00:03:51.269> behind<00:03:51.599> and<00:03:52.079> we<00:03:52.530> can<00:03:52.680> adhere<00:03:52.829> them<00:03:53.190> down

00:03:53.479 --> 00:03:53.489 
them behind and we can adhere them down

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:57.020 
them behind and we can adhere them down
using<00:03:53.970> either<00:03:54.150> dimensionals<00:03:55.049> or<00:03:55.609> using<00:03:56.609> just

00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:57.030 
using either dimensionals or using just

00:03:57.030 --> 00:03:59.210 
using either dimensionals or using just
regular<00:03:57.120> tombow<00:03:57.930> mono<00:03:58.109> multi<00:03:58.650> glue<00:03:58.680> I'm

00:03:59.210 --> 00:03:59.220 
regular tombow mono multi glue I'm

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:01.069 
regular tombow mono multi glue I'm
actually<00:03:59.700> going<00:04:00.030> to<00:04:00.150> use<00:04:00.359> some<00:04:00.599> pieces<00:04:00.900> of

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:01.079 
actually going to use some pieces of

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:05.390 
actually going to use some pieces of
dimensionals<00:04:02.040> so<00:04:02.609> let<00:04:03.329> me<00:04:03.450> cut<00:04:03.780> up<00:04:04.280> I'm<00:04:05.280> going

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:05.400 
dimensionals so let me cut up I'm going

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.460 
dimensionals so let me cut up I'm going
to<00:04:05.459> take<00:04:05.669> one<00:04:05.970> dimensional<00:04:06.630> I<00:04:06.810> think<00:04:07.109> and<00:04:07.260> cut

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470 
to take one dimensional I think and cut

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:11.170 
to take one dimensional I think and cut
it<00:04:07.620> very<00:04:07.859> very<00:04:08.069> thin<00:04:08.220> into<00:04:08.880> little<00:04:09.180> strips<00:04:10.069> so

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:11.180 
it very very thin into little strips so

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:13.039 
it very very thin into little strips so
I'm<00:04:12.180> going<00:04:12.329> to<00:04:12.389> get<00:04:12.510> four<00:04:12.840> little

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:13.049 
I'm going to get four little

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:15.080 
I'm going to get four little
dimensionals<00:04:13.769> out<00:04:13.980> of<00:04:14.099> that<00:04:14.250> one<00:04:14.459> dimensional

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.090 
dimensionals out of that one dimensional

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:20.300 
dimensionals out of that one dimensional
and<00:04:16.310> just<00:04:17.310> going<00:04:17.459> to<00:04:17.519> go<00:04:17.579> ahead<00:04:18.120> here<00:04:18.719> and<00:04:19.310> add

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:20.310 
and just going to go ahead here and add

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:23.600 
and just going to go ahead here and add
those<00:04:20.729> dimensionals<00:04:21.710> just<00:04:22.710> to<00:04:22.890> the<00:04:23.010> backside

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
those dimensionals just to the backside

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:24.350 
those dimensionals just to the backside
of<00:04:23.880> my

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:24.360 
of my

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:28.309 
of my
art<00:04:26.030> or<00:04:27.030> I<00:04:27.060> think<00:04:27.389> the<00:04:27.539> wings<00:04:27.810> will<00:04:28.169> be

00:04:28.309 --> 00:04:28.319 
art or I think the wings will be

00:04:28.319 --> 00:04:32.990 
art or I think the wings will be
positioned<00:04:29.060> pull<00:04:30.060> off<00:04:30.270> the<00:04:30.479> XS<00:04:30.990> here<00:04:31.849> and<00:04:32.849> then

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 
positioned pull off the XS here and then

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.969 
positioned pull off the XS here and then
let's<00:04:33.210> figure<00:04:33.569> out<00:04:33.750> how<00:04:34.110> we<00:04:34.169> want<00:04:34.500> our<00:04:34.650> wings

00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:34.979 
let's figure out how we want our wings

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:40.330 
let's figure out how we want our wings
positioned<00:04:36.349> kind<00:04:37.349> of<00:04:37.439> like<00:04:37.650> them<00:04:37.860> like<00:04:38.039> that

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:40.340 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:46.010 

and<00:04:42.319> like<00:04:43.319> that<00:04:43.620> and<00:04:44.610> then<00:04:45.180> as<00:04:45.330> a<00:04:45.360> final<00:04:45.629> touch

00:04:46.010 --> 00:04:46.020 
and like that and then as a final touch

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:48.170 
and like that and then as a final touch
I<00:04:46.349> just<00:04:46.680> want<00:04:46.860> to<00:04:46.949> add<00:04:47.099> some<00:04:47.520> dazzling

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:48.180 
I just want to add some dazzling

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:50.540 
I just want to add some dazzling
diamonds<00:04:48.479> which<00:04:49.289> I<00:04:49.469> keep<00:04:49.680> in<00:04:49.860> this<00:04:50.009> container

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:50.550 
diamonds which I keep in this container

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:52.939 
diamonds which I keep in this container
you<00:04:51.330> can<00:04:51.479> actually<00:04:51.719> use<00:04:52.199> the<00:04:52.439> dazzling

00:04:52.939 --> 00:04:52.949 
you can actually use the dazzling

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:56.330 
you can actually use the dazzling
details<00:04:53.490> as<00:04:53.819> well<00:04:54.240> if<00:04:54.629> you<00:04:55.259> want<00:04:55.530> which<00:04:55.949> comes

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:56.340 
details as well if you want which comes

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:57.920 
details as well if you want which comes
in<00:04:56.520> a<00:04:56.610> bottle<00:04:56.789> so<00:04:57.150> that<00:04:57.180> you<00:04:57.389> don't<00:04:57.569> create<00:04:57.810> a

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:57.930 
in a bottle so that you don't create a

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:00.140 
in a bottle so that you don't create a
very<00:04:58.289> large<00:04:58.560> mess<00:04:58.919> like<00:04:59.159> I<00:04:59.340> usually<00:04:59.759> do<00:04:59.969> with

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:00.150 
very large mess like I usually do with

00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:02.450 
very large mess like I usually do with
my<00:05:00.300> dazzling<00:05:00.750> diamonds<00:05:00.960> glitter<00:05:01.469> just<00:05:02.250> a

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460 
my dazzling diamonds glitter just a

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:04.279 
my dazzling diamonds glitter just a
little<00:05:02.939> note<00:05:03.180> about<00:05:03.509> these<00:05:03.719> two<00:05:03.930> different

00:05:04.279 --> 00:05:04.289 
little note about these two different

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:06.740 
little note about these two different
products<00:05:04.770> when<00:05:05.550> I<00:05:05.580> use<00:05:05.849> my<00:05:06.060> dazzling<00:05:06.539> diamonds

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:06.750 
products when I use my dazzling diamonds

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:09.320 
products when I use my dazzling diamonds
glitter<00:05:07.259> I<00:05:07.349> just<00:05:07.680> use<00:05:07.889> a<00:05:07.919> 2-way<00:05:08.430> glue<00:05:08.729> pen<00:05:08.759> and

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:09.330 
glitter I just use a 2-way glue pen and

00:05:09.330 --> 00:05:11.869 
glitter I just use a 2-way glue pen and
it<00:05:09.419> seems<00:05:09.689> to<00:05:09.870> dry<00:05:10.110> very<00:05:10.439> very<00:05:10.740> quickly<00:05:11.099> the

00:05:11.869 --> 00:05:11.879 
it seems to dry very very quickly the

00:05:11.879 --> 00:05:14.029 
it seems to dry very very quickly the
downside<00:05:12.389> is<00:05:12.659> that<00:05:12.689> you<00:05:13.110> likely<00:05:13.680> will<00:05:13.889> get

00:05:14.029 --> 00:05:14.039 
downside is that you likely will get

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:16.309 
downside is that you likely will get
glitter<00:05:14.400> in<00:05:14.699> other<00:05:15.029> places<00:05:15.479> in<00:05:15.840> your<00:05:15.990> craft

00:05:16.309 --> 00:05:16.319 
glitter in other places in your craft

00:05:16.319 --> 00:05:20.209 
glitter in other places in your craft
room<00:05:16.610> this<00:05:17.610> the<00:05:18.060> dazzle<00:05:18.479> details<00:05:19.050> is<00:05:19.469> a<00:05:20.009> lot

00:05:20.209 --> 00:05:20.219 
room this the dazzle details is a lot

00:05:20.219 --> 00:05:21.800 
room this the dazzle details is a lot
cleaner<00:05:20.639> in<00:05:20.969> that<00:05:21.210> you<00:05:21.330> don't<00:05:21.419> have<00:05:21.539> glitter

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:21.810 
cleaner in that you don't have glitter

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:24.920 
cleaner in that you don't have glitter
flying<00:05:22.199> everywhere<00:05:22.590> the<00:05:23.580> other<00:05:24.120> part<00:05:24.599> to<00:05:24.779> this

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:24.930 
flying everywhere the other part to this

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:26.749 
flying everywhere the other part to this
though<00:05:25.199> is<00:05:25.349> that<00:05:25.500> it<00:05:25.590> does<00:05:25.770> take<00:05:25.800> some<00:05:26.069> time<00:05:26.520> to

00:05:26.749 --> 00:05:26.759 
though is that it does take some time to

00:05:26.759 --> 00:05:29.180 
though is that it does take some time to
dry<00:05:26.939> since<00:05:27.449> it<00:05:27.629> already<00:05:27.810> is<00:05:28.379> in<00:05:28.830> a<00:05:28.949> viscous

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:29.190 
dry since it already is in a viscous

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:32.450 
dry since it already is in a viscous
kind<00:05:30.060> of<00:05:30.180> glue<00:05:30.449> base<00:05:30.719> so<00:05:31.289> you<00:05:31.919> just<00:05:32.099> need<00:05:32.250> to

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:32.460 
kind of glue base so you just need to

00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:34.249 
kind of glue base so you just need to
weigh<00:05:32.610> the<00:05:32.879> pluses<00:05:33.210> and<00:05:33.479> minuses<00:05:34.020> for

00:05:34.249 --> 00:05:34.259 
weigh the pluses and minuses for

00:05:34.259 --> 00:05:36.680 
weigh the pluses and minuses for
yourself<00:05:34.650> for<00:05:35.099> your<00:05:35.279> project<00:05:35.879> so<00:05:36.419> for<00:05:36.599> this

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:36.690

00:05:39.079 --> 00:05:39.089 
one I'm just going to use the 2-way glue

00:05:39.089 --> 00:05:43.249 
one I'm just going to use the 2-way glue
pen<00:05:39.120> to<00:05:40.110> add<00:05:40.289> some<00:05:41.009> glue<00:05:41.339> to<00:05:41.669> my<00:05:42.509> wings<00:05:42.839> and
