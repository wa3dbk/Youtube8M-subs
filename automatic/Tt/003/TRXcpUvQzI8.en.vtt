00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:14.849
 19 people know each other here 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.230
 gameplay comments and indeed it works 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:18.270
 today again about black ops 2 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.600
 and yes what to say the gamescom 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:23.640
 has raised some questions too 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:26.310
 unlock and levelystem and to 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.529
 christi iv system and may has david of 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.140
 therefore now more or less in one 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.149
 interview explains why more or 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:34.739
 less they said today that they 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.110
 in some points even himself 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:38.520
 not quite sure so see black ops 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.780
 does not seem to be developing yet 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.149
 as far as we all think 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.520
 So it seems like it's whole 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.350
 very important building blocks still 

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.930
 not 100 percent regulated and would 

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.309
 they still hold and grind there 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.719
 whether that should worry you or 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:53.489
 It motivates a thing like that 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:55.860
 I actually finds gut that I so 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.969
 really pure and increase in the year 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:00.210
 Just start now 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:02.699
 it is supposed to give 55 levels that's the way it is 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.080
 pretty sure progressive and how much 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.689
 prestige there are today 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.369
 not yet 100 percent sure 

00:01:05.689 --> 00:01:09.869
 but rumors are also based 15 and would 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:11.670
 even being 15 would be complete for me 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:14.280
 Realistically ten were not enough to know 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:17.280
 sun conscience too much, so I think 15 

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.500
 we are okay and yes , yes 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.299
 Also known that there are no more coins 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.970
 But yes there are now so to speak what 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:26.759
 alternative and that means there she has 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:29.549
 that as chips and coins were 

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.930
 quasi replaced by chips and with these 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.180
 chips now come from continued 

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.770
 unlock and not just expose 

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.110
 but virtually the complete equipment 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.400
 really everything and also the single one 

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.960
 sightsee and so on me now 

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.119
 So everybody could understand 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.380
 Part of a class editor 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:44.399
 Can you go there with such a chip 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:46.259
 unlock 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:47.790
 however, the whole system is aware 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:49.259
 different because you also need that 

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.930
 level to it means you have to 

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:54.060
 Example of the weapon have xy level 30 

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.710
 and then this weapon with a chip 

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.030
 unlock it so that was black 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.219
 it was not even possible to do that 

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:03.930
 pay directly with the coins 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:06.149
 and you just have 55 chips in the ideal case 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.280
 you get a ship for every level 

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:11.310
 that is, if one makes movies he he 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.410
 not prestigious one has just the 55 of the 

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:15.630
 There are chips that you can use 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:18.480
 But far more than 100 pieces of equipment 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:20.790
 that means you can not get rich 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.860
 yes you have to press deep at the 

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.600
 end to have any equipment 

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.940
 how many tubes and now for one 

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:29.400
 prestige gets or ships I stop 

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:32.330
 in addition to German he is still 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:35.430
 not 100 percent clear 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:37.350
 but you will not be sure 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.209
 more first prestige then the 100 have 

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:40.410
 it will not be like that, so you get 

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:43.590
 then with each plastically one 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:46.410
 certain number and yes what you are there 

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:48.420
 with progressively again can be virtually free 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:49.620
 Keep like that in only 3 cases 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.010
 is also a nice book of rhine victory 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.430
 clear 

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:55.500
 there are all safe but at the moment 

00:02:53.430 --> 00:03:00.269
 are the base so you switch on 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:02.610
 prestige 1 the weapon xy free and therefore 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:04.230
 7:30 and then impressive 2 you get 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.519
 with level 30 the weapon without them yet 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.680
 once free to switch 

00:03:05.519 --> 00:03:09.060
 you can do that at the moment you can 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.230
 Write as you find the whole thing 

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.489
 the gameplay is already over 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.519
 not been so long 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:15.930
 So today but still not 100% now 

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:17.610
 you just understood the final spurt 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:22.190
 back and yes the enns before here 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:22.190
 48 fall until first look around
