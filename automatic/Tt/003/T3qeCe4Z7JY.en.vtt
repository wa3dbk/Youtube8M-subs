Author it's going to tell you that it

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.580 
Author it's going to tell you that it
needs<00:00:17.850> to<00:00:18.060> be<00:00:18.180> on<00:00:18.359> ten<00:00:18.630> point<00:00:18.900> seven<00:00:19.109> or<00:00:19.380> later

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.640 
needs to be on ten point seven or later
right<00:00:20.580> so<00:00:21.090> we're<00:00:21.810> gonna<00:00:21.930> do<00:00:22.140> a<00:00:22.170> little<00:00:22.380> bit<00:00:22.500> of

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
right so we're gonna do a little bit of

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.730 
right so we're gonna do a little bit of
modifying<00:00:23.189> of<00:00:23.519> some<00:00:23.970> plist<00:00:24.420> files<00:00:25.080> into

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:25.740 
modifying of some plist files into

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.140 
modifying of some plist files into
thinking<00:00:26.670> that<00:00:27.090> our<00:00:28.429> system<00:00:29.429> is<00:00:29.550> ten<00:00:29.910> point

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
thinking that our system is ten point

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.410 
thinking that our system is ten point
seven<00:00:30.449> point<00:00:30.630> two<00:00:30.750> and<00:00:31.309> so<00:00:32.309> before<00:00:33.149> we<00:00:33.270> do<00:00:33.390> that

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:33.420 
seven point two and so before we do that

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.959 
seven point two and so before we do that
a<00:00:33.630> couple<00:00:33.960> of<00:00:34.110> things<00:00:34.320> that<00:00:34.620> you<00:00:35.160> need<00:00:35.460> to<00:00:35.489> do

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:08.100 
here and now we're just going to go

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.700 
here and now we're just going to go
ahead<00:03:08.190> and<00:03:08.400> drag<00:03:08.550> and<00:03:08.730> drop<00:03:08.880> and<00:03:09.470> it's<00:03:10.470> asking

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:10.710 
ahead and drag and drop and it's asking

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:13.490 
ahead and drag and drop and it's asking
to<00:03:11.190> authenticate<00:03:12.260> because<00:03:13.260> we're<00:03:13.410> gonna

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:13.500 
to authenticate because we're gonna

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.280 
to authenticate because we're gonna
replace<00:03:13.890> the<00:03:14.210> system<00:03:15.210> version<00:03:15.510> plist<00:03:15.990> file

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290 
replace the system version plist file

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.340 
replace the system version plist file

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:19.350 
and so we just go ahead and authenticate

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.560 
and so we just go ahead and authenticate
to<00:03:19.620> put<00:03:19.800> in<00:03:19.920> our<00:03:20.100> password<00:03:20.640> whatever<00:03:21.150> it<00:03:21.420> is

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:21.570
