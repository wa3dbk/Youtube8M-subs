00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.400
 hello again my name is rinat 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.310
 Welcome to the project of the string factory 

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:20.900
 today we will analyze the band's song 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:20.900
 b-2 my rock and roll 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:47.910
 but 

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:11.770
 more 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.880
 the sum 

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.880
 what 

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:55.260
 Now we will analyze this song to start 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:58.680
 analyze brute brute with us here 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:02:03.980
 played throughout the entire song one and 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:03.980
 the same game started I quickly 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:24.290
 now the world 5 3 2 1 2 3 2 3 1 3 2 1 2 3 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:27.700
 2 3 depending on the chord just 

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:31.000
 The bass changes, that is, it is possible from 5 or from 6 

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:31.000
 first chord 

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:39.110
 we have the first chord from the note fa set 

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:41.720
 sixth string index finger 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:45.019
 first fret middle finger set on 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:52.480
 third string whole 2 fret play brute force 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:03:01.010
 from 5 strings and move 6 strings and grams brute force 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:03:05.300
 6 3 2 1 2 3 2 3 then we present 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:08.860
 ring finger on the sixth string 3 fret 

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:17.750
 We play also from 6 strings and the same search 

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:22.250
 6 3 2 1 2 3 2 3 then p middle finger 

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:25.120
 on 4 on the third string 2 up to play with 5 

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:26.430
 strings and the same bust 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:31.849
 321 

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:33.890
 up to 32 32 game times 

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:36.090
 5321 

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:39.090
 323 

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.090
 it turns out 

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:59.620
 and so on in a circle like this 

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:03.950
 way you can play all the songs 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:08.320
 you can play it again further 

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:17.239
 and rhythmically that is, fight the first chord 

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:20.419
 this f h7 we sound so rhythmic 

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:21.290
 drawing that we play here you can 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:23.950
 to play 

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:28.780
 for example six 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:31.420
 but you can for a more colorful sound 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:35.730
 plays a six without 2 beat that is, we 

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:35.730
 we remove the second share so 

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:52.550
 once again slowly down down down up 

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:55.930
 down up next chord 

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:55.930
 this is g6 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:05.510
 and the third chord which repents twice 

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:05.510
 it's 2 

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:12.810
 it turns out 

00:05:30.729 --> 00:05:37.389
 a place with 2 you can play chord f will 

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:37.389
 look like 

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:53.850
 and also you saw what i played instead 

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:56.790
 match a different chord but also called 

00:05:53.850 --> 00:05:59.820
 just takes it a little different it 

00:05:56.790 --> 00:06:02.070
 part-time chord barre f we set 

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:05.040
 index finger on the sixth string 1 

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:08.130
 then middle finger on third country 2 

00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:11.490
 ring finger on this country 3 and 

00:06:08.130 --> 00:06:14.270
 little finger on the fourth string 3 fret her 

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:14.270
 sound like that 

00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:17.930
 here 

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:27.629
 farther next chord 

00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:29.490
 this is the bottom you are the salt we set the sixth chord 

00:06:27.629 --> 00:06:32.740
 carcass strings meaning we just 

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:35.289
 let's listen in 3 ways 

00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:40.710
 and games, too, he 

00:06:35.289 --> 00:06:40.710
 and then the third chord is 

00:06:43.289 --> 00:06:46.530
 it turns out so 

00:06:54.400 --> 00:07:00.800

00:06:57.590 --> 00:07:02.360
