00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:16.270
 Hello, everyone . 

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:19.420
 Today's Mine Craft Borden. 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:24.339
 Originally the usual wild charcoal 

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:29.080
 I could not change the charcoal into a block. 

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:30.640
 It's a mode that turns charcoal into blocks of charcoal. 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:34.870
 I'm Sugar. 

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:37.360
 Let's see what mode it is once with a smile from now on 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:41.410
 Do you know if you go down on the date 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:47.129
 You'll need a workbench . 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:52.770
 Llano'll leave it to the right and then replicate 

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:55.829
 Next time you're ready for something like wood . 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:59.460
 Do this with 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:04.229
 It can very easily create 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:05.519
 So there is a gong immediately pour the charcoal, you also get a lot of digits 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:09.800
 I know you occupied it. 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:13.270
 Because it takes up a lot of charcoal, this wood 

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:14.470
 I can turn it into a block . 

00:01:13.270 --> 00:01:17.939
 U 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.939
 This charcoal comes out of this charcoal 

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:22.049
 Mike's on the potatoes. 

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:28.650
 I'll take out a lot of stuff . 

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:28.650
 I can not rest 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:36.399
 This call comes bomb did leave intact the simyeon dip as making 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:40.659
 A charcoal block is the same as a bomb . 

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:43.960
 Hey, I can not back that charcoal to burn about 8 sikke items related to 

00:01:40.659 --> 00:01:47.470
 1 Easy item 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:49.470
 You can see about 80 items in Rollo 

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:49.470
 U 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.500
 This can create a mothamyeo flowed this way to burn its head 

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:59.329
 There is 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:04.579
 I have brought charcoals that are very convenient, and I've been able to smile with you until now. 

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:05.450
 Have you had a lot of fun? 

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:08.479
