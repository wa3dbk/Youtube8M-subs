00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:26.760
 it is quite strange to drive a golf course 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.010
 the sports car par excellence of the 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.380
 young people in a quiet version 

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:34.620
 variant more suited to families than 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:38.309
 to the sports raids yet the 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.570
 volkswagen golf variant 1.4 tsi that 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.610

 Via marcucci collaborator it was 

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.260
 satisfied for its merits already by 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.210
 look that embarrasses those who 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.700
 originally they thought of a passat 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:53.820
 variant but which find the golf variant 

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:56.820

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.080
 rear seat in normal position 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:10.590
 and the 1620 liters with the backrest 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.170
 overturned the golf variant we have 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:18.479
 driven and the night of the petrol engine 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:20.759
 the 1395 cc 122 horsepower gearbox 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.759
 6-speed manual and stop system 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:28.200
 start matching that meets the 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:30.570
 anti-pollution legislation euro 5 b la 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.200

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.790
 simple steering wheel without any buttons 

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.740
 the typical dashboard has two 

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.470
 round instruments with tachometer e 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:42.630

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:52.500
 computer indication I address and 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:54.689

 guide her and make her strong point fun 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:09.530
 they entered guided where it is very 

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:11.060
 agile thanks to the sensitive steering that 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:13.850
 also transmits small movements 

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:16.850
 made by drivers giving the feeling 

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:18.670
 to let oneself be dominated by those who are seated 

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:20.720
 behind the steering wheel 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:21.830
 this happens also thanks to 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:25.460
 electronic differential lock 

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:26.840

 the most fun and sporty one 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:39.290
 we really appreciated the setting 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.970
 of cruise control that does not interrupt the 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.460
 its function when pressing the clutch 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.020
 and change gear 

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:47.810
 eliminating the need to reset 

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:50.810
 the speed of gait whenever 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:56.660
 we need to change the length ratio 

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:58.580
 of 4,562 mm and the width of 1,799 mm 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:03:01.070
 make it suitable also for 

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:03.650
 circulation through traffic in 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:05.620

 extraurban 5.30 liters in the cycle 

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:23.450
 combined 

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:27.010
 always obviously related to one
