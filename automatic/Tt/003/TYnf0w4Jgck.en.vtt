00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:12.030
 quality in personal engineering should 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.679
 It is directly proportional to its price 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.199
 in any case, the majority thinks so 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:18.180
 global manufacturers except Chinese 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.130
 guys from the sky in the last 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.109
 time is steadily proving to the whole world 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.600
 that a low price tag is not always 

00:00:22.109 --> 00:00:26.460
 determine the type of product one of the companies 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.260
 worthy products that afford 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.539
 everyone is soundmagic 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.550
 and headphones and 10 which today and 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.500
 Dmytro on sledge will speak 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.739
 project room cop let's look at them 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.739
 in more detail 

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:05.590
 in addition to the target product in the kit 

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:08.140
 Delivery includes a set of 6 ordinary 

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:10.330
 nozzles and one pair of two petal 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:13.000
 Christmas tree clip and quality tight 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:14.860
 cheholchik proceed to the ears alone 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.050
 of the most important elements affecting 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.850
 sound quality and often durability 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:21.040
 headphone cable in our case 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:22.690
 stranded copper covenant wires between 

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:25.090
 itself which greatly increases 

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:27.640
 conductor wear resistance which 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:30.280
 reinforcement hindering its excesses 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.960
 cable braid is most likely silicone 

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.479
 so as not harden in the cold and not 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:37.030
 cable v-shaped its length 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:39.190
 is 1 and 2 meters plug housing and 

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.960
 aluminum splitter despite 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:42.610
 proud inscription we eat tea them 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.530
 processing and painting done 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:46.150
 qualitatively unlike cambric in 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:48.430
 casting which could be more 

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:50.290
 neat casing of the headphones themselves 

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:52.270
 made primarily of metal 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:54.100
 The quality of the fitting components is very 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.770
 high like no other village 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.869
 there are no flaws besides color 

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:00.930
 gun sale also available 

00:01:58.869 --> 00:02:03.550
 red golden and purple colors 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:05.650
 ear cushions anyway complete 

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:07.780
 sit very tightly take them off deliberately 

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:09.700
 It turns out the first time is not far 

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.980
 always the fact that they can accidentally 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.720
 fly and do not talk at all by the way 

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:15.459
 Immediately, I note that the sound of all 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.620
 in-ear headphones in part 

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:20.049
 depends on the density of the landing ear cushions 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.150
 so pick them carefully before 

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:24.250
 how to talk about the sound stop 

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:25.360
 on the characteristics of the soundmagic headphones 

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:27.340
 e10 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:29.470
 installed typical dynamic 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.510
 10 diameter neodymium drivers 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:35.350
 millimeters they work in frequency 

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:37.209
 range from 15 hertz to 22 kilohertz what 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:38.860
 on paper is pretty good 

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:39.970
 headphone sensitivity indicator 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:42.580
 100 decibels 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:44.170
 and the resistance is only 16 he 

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.390
 that means they work 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:48.280
 with virtually any source in any 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.920
 power to practice sound really 

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:53.590
 turned out to be very good at the same time 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:55.900
 informative and pleasant soft noisy 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.700
 and the sound distortion is much lower than that of 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:59.860
 many competitors from this price 

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.090
 segment treble sound 

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:03.280
 practically idea 

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:05.650
 whereas on the middle one sometimes feels 

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:08.019
 failure though most likely it is more 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:10.569
 depends on the composition as much as 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:12.640
 table vacuum headphone d10 acid 

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:15.220
 Basyat although in their case low frequencies 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:17.470
 very soft they do not put pressure on the brain and not 

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:19.930
 clog up the middle and top so 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:21.730
 Do not deprive the sound of information content 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.769
 it is worth understanding that the potential of these 

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:26.170
 headphone is pretty tall and in order 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:28.540
 to uncover the possibilities of massive 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:30.489
 Players and phones are not enough at least 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.049
 because even through the integrated 

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:33.910
 computer sound card 

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:36.280
 they sound better than any 

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:38.680
 smartphone or ipod despite the fact that 

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:39.370
 headphones are loud enough from what 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:41.319
 whatever 

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:43.959
 the difference in sound quality itself 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:46.180
 the source feels good when you buy 

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:48.549
 keep this in mind by saying simple 

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:50.110
 words not 10 sound much more expensive than 

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:52.209
 worth it really for example 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:55.180
 similar sound from the company of sun Kaiser 

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:57.220
 will cost you 80 100 dollars although 

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:59.319
 higher price tags these headphones don't 

00:03:57.220 --> 00:04:01.060
 will be able to boast of a similar quality 

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:03.670
 performance worth our heroes on 

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:05.440
 the territory of Ukraine about 36 green and 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:07.299
 for such a sum it is the perfect replacement 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:09.010
 high-quality complete headset and 

00:04:07.299 --> 00:04:11.019
 just a good accessory for your 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:12.910
 player potential and which can 

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:14.319
 consider even redundant considering not 

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:16.870
 highest sound quality 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:17.979
 modern smartphones mp3 players 

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:19.900
 famous brands 

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:21.760
 it was a video on ferrum q we are waiting 

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:23.320
 our thumbs up sign on channel a 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.639
 also on our website and in 

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:30.220
 social networking groups 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:31.990
 Thank you all for watching one of 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:34.060
 Companies worthy of products whose 

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:38.740
 everyone's pocket are soundmagic 

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:43.360
 and today you will be talking about their headphone and 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:46.080
 weighs write anyway so 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:50.580
 do you think all global manufacturers 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:50.580
 1 review is dirty 

00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:57.280
 one of the companies worthy products 

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:59.380
 who afford to what data 

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:01.990
 headphone partly depends on the density 

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:04.680
 landing ear cushions so pick them up 

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:04.680
 carefully 

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:12.670
 there is a corner to be yours
