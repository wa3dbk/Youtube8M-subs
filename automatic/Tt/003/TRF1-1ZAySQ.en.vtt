there's something going on
neurologically<00:00:27.060> so<00:00:27.750> what<00:00:27.900> we're<00:00:28.050> going<00:00:28.140> to<00:00:28.230> do

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349 
neurologically so what we're going to do

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.740 
neurologically so what we're going to do
is<00:00:28.470> some<00:00:28.680> of<00:00:28.800> our<00:00:28.949> tests<00:00:29.369> and<00:00:29.519> run<00:00:30.000> on<00:00:30.240> him<00:00:30.269> it's

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.269 
is some of our tests and run on him it's
a<00:00:30.869> neurological<00:00:31.050> exam<00:00:31.769> and<00:00:31.980> we're<00:00:32.070> going<00:00:32.189> to

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279 
a neurological exam and we're going to

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.870 
a neurological exam and we're going to
see<00:00:32.340> what<00:00:32.460> we<00:00:32.520> come<00:00:32.640> up<00:00:32.700> with<00:00:32.850> here<00:00:34.790> when<00:00:35.790> you

sit right over here first first we're
going<00:00:41.579> to<00:00:41.640> look<00:00:41.730> at<00:00:41.850> his<00:00:41.969> pupils<00:00:45.649> when<00:00:46.649> we

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
going to look at his pupils when we

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.670 
going to look at his pupils when we
shine<00:00:46.950> into<00:00:47.399> this<00:00:47.579> I<00:00:47.930> his<00:00:48.930> people<00:00:49.320> actually

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
shine into this I his people actually

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.090 
shine into this I his people actually
fails<00:00:50.010> fairly<00:00:50.610> quickly<00:00:51.170> and<00:00:52.170> if<00:00:52.289> you<00:00:52.379> look<00:00:52.890> at

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.100 
fails fairly quickly and if you look at

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.069 
fails fairly quickly and if you look at
on<00:00:53.309> here<00:00:53.610> get<00:00:53.879> a<00:00:53.910> shot<00:00:54.149> he<00:00:54.420> actually<00:00:54.600> has<00:00:54.930> what

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
on here get a shot he actually has what

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.799 
on here get a shot he actually has what
we<00:00:55.110> call<00:00:55.170> lid<00:00:55.559> ptosis<00:00:56.070> where<00:00:56.940> he<00:00:57.270> has<00:00:57.390> eyelid

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
we call lid ptosis where he has eyelid

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:00.110 
we call lid ptosis where he has eyelid
on<00:00:57.930> the<00:00:58.020> left<00:00:58.230> side<00:00:58.440> it's<00:00:58.680> somewhat<00:00:59.100> lower<00:00:59.879> and

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
on the left side it's somewhat lower and

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:01.400 
on the left side it's somewhat lower and
drooping<00:01:00.480> more<00:01:00.600> than<00:01:00.780> it<00:01:00.870> is<00:01:00.989> on<00:01:01.020> the<00:01:01.230> right

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:01.410 
drooping more than it is on the right

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:03.799 
drooping more than it is on the right
it's<00:01:02.039> actually<00:01:02.190> a<00:01:02.640> problem<00:01:03.239> with<00:01:03.420> cranial

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
it's actually a problem with cranial

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.649 
it's actually a problem with cranial
nerve<00:01:03.960> three<00:01:04.350> that<00:01:04.589> sits<00:01:04.830> at<00:01:04.949> amit's<00:01:05.220> f1<00:01:05.729> and

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
nerve three that sits at amit's f1 and

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.539 
nerve three that sits at amit's f1 and
that's<00:01:06.960> a<00:01:07.080> since<00:01:07.650> the<00:01:07.770> accident<00:01:07.920> that<00:01:08.159> was<00:01:08.369> not

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
that's a since the accident that was not

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:09.940 
that's a since the accident that was not
there<00:01:08.760> before<00:01:08.790> they<00:01:09.240> actually<00:01:09.390> my<00:01:09.659> correct

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:09.950 
there before they actually my correct

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:16.280 
there before they actually my correct
that's<00:01:10.950> correct<00:01:11.869> when<00:01:12.869> I<00:01:12.930> come<00:01:13.170> to<00:01:13.350> this<00:01:13.470> I<00:01:15.290> and

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:16.290 
that's correct when I come to this I and

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.210 
that's correct when I come to this I and
that<00:01:16.380> one<00:01:16.560> holds<00:01:16.890> fairly<00:01:17.280> well<00:01:17.490> this<00:01:18.360> one

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.220 
that one holds fairly well this one

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:24.770 
that one holds fairly well this one
holds<00:01:20.220> but<00:01:20.520> fails<00:01:22.100> immediately<00:01:23.630> which<00:01:24.630> is

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
holds but fails immediately which is

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.999 
holds but fails immediately which is
indicate<00:01:25.229> about<00:01:25.470> some<00:01:26.390> nerve<00:01:27.390> damage<00:01:28.170> to<00:01:28.740> the

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
indicate about some nerve damage to the

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.460 
indicate about some nerve damage to the
reason<00:01:29.759> cephalon<00:01:30.240> area<00:01:30.630> and<00:01:31.259> then<00:01:31.380> we're

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
reason cephalon area and then we're

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.069 
reason cephalon area and then we're
going<00:01:31.560> to<00:01:31.650> have<00:01:31.799> mark<00:01:32.070> stand<00:01:32.340> up<00:01:32.990> we're<00:01:33.990> going

00:01:34.069 --> 00:01:34.079 
going to have mark stand up we're going

00:01:34.079 --> 00:01:38.060 
going to have mark stand up we're going
to<00:01:34.140> handstand<00:01:34.380> on<00:01:34.650> his<00:01:34.740> right<00:01:34.950> leg<00:01:36.829> then<00:01:37.829> tuck

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
to handstand on his right leg then tuck

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.040 
to handstand on his right leg then tuck
your<00:01:38.220> chin<00:01:38.250> down

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:40.050 
your chin down

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:42.690 
your chin down
he<00:01:41.050> immediately<00:01:41.290> has<00:01:41.830> trouble<00:01:42.430> with<00:01:42.520> his

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 
he immediately has trouble with his

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:49.640 
he immediately has trouble with his
balance<00:01:43.180> ramps<00:01:43.720> down<00:01:43.870> his<00:01:44.140> left<00:01:45.840> the<00:01:46.840> kitchen

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:49.650 

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:52.230 

so<00:01:50.650> he<00:01:50.770> has<00:01:50.950> better<00:01:51.340> balance<00:01:51.760> on<00:01:51.850> that<00:01:51.880> side

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
so he has better balance on that side

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.000 
so he has better balance on that side
that<00:01:52.270> is<00:01:52.420> right<00:01:52.690> was<00:01:52.900> significantly<00:01:53.530> impaired

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:54.010 
that is right was significantly impaired

00:01:54.010 --> 00:02:02.590 
that is right was significantly impaired

stand with his feet further part 2 now
if<00:02:46.130> he<00:02:46.220> closes<00:02:46.400> his<00:02:46.670> eyes<00:02:46.910> with<00:02:47.360> his<00:02:47.420> feet

this<00:02:51.980> is<00:02:52.280> balancing<00:02:52.910> is<00:02:53.060> nearly<00:02:53.240> immediately

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
this is balancing is nearly immediately

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.770 
this is balancing is nearly immediately
so<00:02:55.130> that's<00:02:55.310> another<00:02:55.610> significant<00:02:56.270> neurologic

00:02:56.770 --> 00:02:56.780 
so that's another significant neurologic

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.690 
so that's another significant neurologic
finding<00:02:57.140> that<00:02:57.260> we've<00:02:57.410> just<00:02:57.440> come<00:02:57.860> up<00:02:58.040> with<00:02:58.220> now

00:02:58.690 --> 00:02:58.700 
finding that we've just come up with now

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
going to do something called

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:05.710 
going to do something called
optogenetics<00:03:04.490> we're<00:03:05.090> going<00:03:05.210> to<00:03:05.270> check<00:03:05.510> all

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720 
optogenetics we're going to check all

optogenetics we're going to check all
his<00:03:05.840> eyes<00:03:05.990> are<00:03:06.230> motioning<00:03:06.710> this<00:03:07.520> time<00:03:07.760> we're

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
his eyes are motioning this time we're

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:09.670 
his eyes are motioning this time we're
going<00:03:08.060> to<00:03:08.150> go<00:03:08.270> from<00:03:08.480> left<00:03:08.840> to<00:03:08.990> right<00:03:09.140> and<00:03:09.590> he's

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:09.680 
going to go from left to right and he's

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.110 
going to go from left to right and he's
going<00:03:09.800> to<00:03:09.860> watch<00:03:10.070> each<00:03:10.310> red<00:03:10.550> one<00:03:10.700> as<00:03:10.850> it<00:03:10.970> goes

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 
going to watch each red one as it goes

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:19.300 
going to watch each red one as it goes
by<00:03:11.360> that<00:03:15.460> bothered<00:03:16.460> you<00:03:16.580> do<00:03:16.730> it<00:03:16.790> in<00:03:18.310> just

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:19.310 
by that bothered you do it in just

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:24.550 
by that bothered you do it in just
trying<00:03:19.580> to<00:03:19.610> concentrate<00:03:20.060> on<00:03:23.230> so<00:03:24.230> you<00:03:24.290> can<00:03:24.410> see

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:24.560 
trying to concentrate on so you can see

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.050 
trying to concentrate on so you can see
towards<00:03:24.860> the<00:03:24.950> end<00:03:25.100> there<00:03:25.160> in<00:03:25.340> his<00:03:25.400> eyes<00:03:25.610> rather

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060 
towards the end there in his eyes rather

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:27.970 
towards the end there in his eyes rather
than<00:03:26.270> staying<00:03:26.570> pursuing<00:03:27.170> they<00:03:27.320> start<00:03:27.590> to<00:03:27.710> fail

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:27.980 
than staying pursuing they start to fail

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:30.490 
than staying pursuing they start to fail
and<00:03:28.190> come<00:03:28.370> back<00:03:28.520> this<00:03:28.730> way<00:03:28.790> so<00:03:29.720> that's

00:03:30.490 --> 00:03:30.500 
and come back this way so that's

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.230 
and come back this way so that's
actually<00:03:30.890> an<00:03:31.040> indication<00:03:31.640> of<00:03:31.910> a<00:03:32.030> right

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:32.240 
actually an indication of a right

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:34.690 
actually an indication of a right
parietal<00:03:32.540> lobe<00:03:32.870> injury<00:03:33.460> now<00:03:34.460> we're<00:03:34.550> going<00:03:34.640> to

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:34.700 
parietal lobe injury now we're going to

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:40.480 
parietal lobe injury now we're going to
come<00:03:34.820> back<00:03:34.940> the<00:03:35.090> other<00:03:35.150> way<00:03:39.310> so<00:03:40.310> that<00:03:40.340> we

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:40.490 
come back the other way so that we

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:42.220 
come back the other way so that we
follow<00:03:41.030> the<00:03:41.210> better<00:03:41.450> you<00:03:41.600> can<00:03:41.750> see<00:03:41.900> it<00:03:41.990> didn't

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.230 
follow the better you can see it didn't

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:45.190 
follow the better you can see it didn't
bother<00:03:42.380> him<00:03:42.560> quite<00:03:42.860> as<00:03:43.010> much
