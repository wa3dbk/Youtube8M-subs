sorry you're not allowed to use the
smoke<00:02:09.310> machine<00:02:09.429> any<00:02:10.000> I'd<00:02:10.360> already<00:02:10.539> asked<00:02:11.110> a

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:11.230 
smoke machine any I'd already asked a

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:12.720 
smoke machine any I'd already asked a
senior<00:02:11.650> member<00:02:11.920> of<00:02:11.950> staff<00:02:12.160> there<00:02:12.459> and<00:02:12.670> they

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
senior member of staff there and they

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.699 
senior member of staff there and they
said<00:02:12.910> yeah<00:02:13.030> fine<00:02:14.910> so<00:02:15.959> what'd<00:02:16.959> you<00:02:16.990> do<00:02:17.230> you<00:02:17.560> know

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:17.709 
said yeah fine so what'd you do you know

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:20.160 
said yeah fine so what'd you do you know
yeah<00:02:17.980> the<00:02:18.520> trouble<00:02:18.730> is<00:02:18.910> the<00:02:19.180> smoke<00:02:19.450> does<00:02:19.810> at

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:20.170 
yeah the trouble is the smoke does at

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.440 
yeah the trouble is the smoke does at
especially<00:02:21.100> with<00:02:21.220> the<00:02:21.310> new<00:02:21.340> LED<00:02:21.940> light<00:02:22.180> it

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:22.450 
especially with the new LED light it

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.449 
especially with the new LED light it
really<00:02:22.750> adds<00:02:22.900> to<00:02:23.050> the<00:02:23.200> effect<00:02:23.290> and<00:02:23.950> the<00:02:23.980> lasers

00:02:24.449 --> 00:02:24.459 
really adds to the effect and the lasers

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:27.059 
really adds to the effect and the lasers
particularly<00:02:25.330> so<00:02:25.989> good<00:02:26.500> from<00:02:26.620> that<00:02:26.770> point<00:02:26.980> of

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:27.069 
particularly so good from that point of

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:30.300 
particularly so good from that point of
view<00:02:27.690> but<00:02:28.690> what<00:02:29.140> you<00:02:29.290> do<00:02:29.440> on<00:02:29.620> that<00:02:29.830> on<00:02:30.069> that<00:02:30.100> I

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:30.310 
view but what you do on that on that I

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:31.380 
view but what you do on that on that I
don't<00:02:30.459> know<00:02:30.670> I<00:02:30.790> don't<00:02:30.970> know<00:02:31.120> what<00:02:31.239> the<00:02:31.360> answer

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:31.390 
don't know I don't know what the answer

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.940 
don't know I don't know what the answer
is<00:02:32.370> as<00:02:33.370> from<00:02:33.760> the<00:02:34.300> kids<00:02:34.540> this<00:02:35.080> goes<00:02:35.290> and<00:02:35.500> less

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950 
is as from the kids this goes and less

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.710 
is as from the kids this goes and less
money<00:02:36.780> yeah<00:02:37.780> i<00:02:38.140> mean<00:02:38.590> i<00:02:38.680> get<00:02:38.860> booked<00:02:39.100> for<00:02:39.310> a<00:02:39.340> few

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:39.720 
money yeah i mean i get booked for a few

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:43.199 
money yeah i mean i get booked for a few
not<00:02:40.720> loads<00:02:40.959> but<00:02:41.230> a<00:02:41.470> couple<00:02:41.860> of<00:02:41.920> what<00:02:42.850> we<00:02:43.000> call

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
not loads but a couple of what we call

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:45.240 
not loads but a couple of what we call
public<00:02:43.750> schools<00:02:43.989> here<00:02:44.320> but<00:02:44.500> private<00:02:44.980> schools

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:45.250 
public schools here but private schools

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:46.680 
public schools here but private schools

i suppose they would be known in the

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.860 
i suppose they would be known in the
states<00:02:47.519> quite<00:02:48.519> well<00:02:48.880> known<00:02:48.910> ones<00:02:49.390> not<00:02:49.600> far

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
states quite well known ones not far

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.110 
states quite well known ones not far
from<00:02:50.050> me<00:02:50.230> and<00:02:50.459> to<00:02:51.459> be<00:02:51.550> honest<00:02:51.730> of<00:02:51.850> kids<00:02:52.030> are

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.120 
from me and to be honest of kids are

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.949 
from me and to be honest of kids are
always<00:02:52.269> very<00:02:52.720> well<00:02:53.350> behaved<00:02:54.310> very<00:02:54.430> polite<00:02:55.030> the

00:02:55.949 --> 00:02:55.959 
always very well behaved very polite the

00:02:55.959 --> 00:03:00.509

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:02.590 
them i would imagine even though they're

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.970 
them i would imagine even though they're
only<00:03:02.769> working<00:03:03.220> at<00:03:03.340> these<00:03:03.459> schools<00:03:03.640> but<00:03:04.980> you

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220

but yeah them I can't complain because

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.350 
but yeah them I can't complain because
normally<00:03:11.890> it's<00:03:12.220> perhaps<00:03:12.400> three<00:03:12.820> hours<00:03:13.180> and

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:13.360 
normally it's perhaps three hours and

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:16.530 
normally it's perhaps three hours and
your<00:03:13.510> home<00:03:13.959> bio<00:03:14.290> scanner<00:03:14.440> at<00:03:14.769> night<00:03:14.920> so<00:03:15.540> it's

which<00:04:01.720> surprises<00:04:01.900> me<00:04:02.350> so<00:04:02.590> perhaps<00:04:02.709> I<00:04:02.980> should

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:03.160 
which surprises me so perhaps I should
