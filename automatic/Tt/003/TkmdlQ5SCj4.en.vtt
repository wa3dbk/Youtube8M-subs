00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:21.609
 [music] 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.750
 Hello, my name is Stanislav Kargin 

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:24.609
 popularly known as veider 

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:26.590
 I'm a game designer for the world of tanks project and 

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:28.329
 Today I will answer your questions on 

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:30.189
 Forum you talked about what gold 

00:00:28.329 --> 00:00:32.500
 projectiles made for eSports 

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:34.690
 how are the golden shells for 

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.460
 silver will help this eSports all 

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:38.230
 the fact is that now in eSports and 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.000
 There are two components personal skill 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:41.410
 teams and just the use of gold 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.390
 shells and gold consumables and 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:44.710
 some new teams are quite young 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.920
 they are very hard about the fact 

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:49.809
 that some teams just donat 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:51.129
 flood them and so we are now in the water 

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:51.879
 here these shells for silver just 

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:53.589
 equalizing chances 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:54.909
 at least in that is each 

00:00:53.589 --> 00:00:55.869
 commands can be allowed to repeat 

00:00:54.909 --> 00:00:58.900
 gold shells 

00:00:55.869 --> 00:01:01.330
 on the principle of fighting is not that long and not 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:02.589
 difficult to farm therefore the introduction 

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:04.360
 these golden shells fiber she 

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:06.689
 allows young teams to calm 

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:09.189
 go into these fights in what 42 and so on 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:11.409
 everyone is afraid that with the advent of gold 

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:13.150
 shells for silver armor will depreciate 

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:14.920
 do you plan to raise the price in 

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:17.049
 silver gold shell so that they 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.270
 have become more difficult for players to 

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:21.280
 in fact all these concerns are for sure 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.740
 just now slightly exceeds the level 

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.939
 right here and the players will not be able to 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.200
 sure to carry a lot 

00:01:24.939 --> 00:01:29.140
 amount of shells because the price and 

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:31.689
 so high enough besides we are all 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:33.219
 We start this business as a share and we will 

00:01:31.689 --> 00:01:34.359
 watch how it all happens and 

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:35.649
 accordingly, then we will be more 

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:36.909
 tune we have some 

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:38.499
 things do not arrange we can price 

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:40.390
 twist it up or we can do it 

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:42.249
 disable that is still unknown how it 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:43.499
 will work and now it is 

00:01:42.249 --> 00:01:45.520
 rather more experiment 

00:01:43.499 --> 00:01:47.829
 therefore, we will see with the help of what 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:49.600
 will be the future are you going to nerf 

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:52.359
 goldovye rounds to armor was not 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.710
 There are no formalities for formalities. 

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:55.539
 at least not going personally I have 

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.670
 some ideas here but they are so 

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:59.469
 now personally what's personal what are they and 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.439
 remain until my head was discussed there 

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:06.749
 sometimes literally there with a couple of people but 

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:08.860
 for now it's all so very secret rather 

00:02:06.749 --> 00:02:10.539
 if any tanks because of this 

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:12.250
 innovations will start to win more often 

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:13.990
 due to the fact that the sibling on them 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.590
 especially well will you be 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:16.720
 their oil 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:19.540
 the fact is that in our project I’m nerfit 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.459
 if the technique is already taken as the basis 

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:23.920
 we will always do if some kind of car 

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:25.300
 will be issued for more than 2 3 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.800
 percent of our norms we will 

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.150
 accordingly and rebalance it already 

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.129
 okay everybody needs to practice this 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.750
 get used and no matter what conditions on 

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:32.790
 it affect 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.500
 and no matter what else happens 

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.680
 there is if there is any knocking out with 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.300
 graphics we will take action if 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:40.830
 gold shells for silver in the end 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.610
 will stay in the game will you do 

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:46.170
 gold u raskhodka for silver too 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.910
 maybe we will answer the question while open 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.860
 that is, we still see how to do 

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:51.090
 gold shells for silver will go to ours 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:54.030
 project and then we will decide 

00:02:51.090 --> 00:02:56.310
 Will consumables ever appear 

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:59.480
 ability to view chateau log in 

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:02.250
 battle date to the problem is in fact and 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.780
 soon this feature will be added here we are 

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.700
 as long as it’s impossible to say when 

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:08.220
 but exactly this very thing you are dear 

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.959
 will there be a separate balance for fireflies 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:12.030
 so that their teams were equally 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:14.430
 we also have such a problem 

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:15.239
 It has long been discussed and to the early 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:18.300
 will it be done 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:20.070
 probably even at the beginning of 2013 will be 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:22.500
 does it touch the pure fireflies 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:24.239
 or it will be for example balance 152 and 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.310
 the balance became 100 pairs letting it be 

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:28.320
 equally in teams and motorcycles and 

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:29.730
 thick parades and part not likely 

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:31.080
 it will be a simple balancer where it will be 

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:33.330
 just count the number of fireflies 

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:34.950
 how will arta appear in the game 

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:37.340
 the ability to create training 

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:39.540
 room for 1 with a dummy of any tank 

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:41.750
 No, unfortunately, such opportunities 

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:43.530
 players can not give the fact that 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.600
 each map created 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:46.680
 she even for single player borrow 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.420
 place on the server to you and as much 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.920
 how much and a card for 30 people therefore 

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:51.900
 we can not afford 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.370
 allocation of huge amounts of resources 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:55.620
 here a do it 

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:57.420
 local launch on the player's client 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:59.670
 too hard to give 

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:01.019
 some kind of code on the local machine of which we 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.459
 We also can not spend on others 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:04.709
 reasons will there ever be 

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:08.010
 the opportunity to choose in the assault side 

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:10.590
 perhaps there is no such option in the checkbox 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:12.000
 problems we do not see, and accordingly 

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:14.430
 such a function we are no longer easy to give 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.380
 otherwise we will just work out like this 

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:18.540
 that all players will choose one side and 

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:21.900
 the balancer will not be able to pick up 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:23.550
 commands until t95 mouse and and others 

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:25.680
 slug and will fall into the attack on 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:28.740
 storme may be worth registering this tank 

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:30.360
 hitting only the div is not that we 

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:32.280
 we won't do it either 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:33.060
 option that we will increase the battle time to 15 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.310
 minutes 

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:37.050
 so slow cars will again 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:39.240
 you mob on the podium and what about 

00:04:37.050 --> 00:04:42.210
 that they are just uncomfortable to attack and they 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.690
 long ride and suffer this but that would be 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:44.910
 too 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:45.990
 easy game let's some players 

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:47.190
 advantage only from the fact that they have 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:50.220
 there is a lot of armor and no 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:52.110
 Speed would be a little silly to be there 

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:54.300
 in the detailed report after the battle added 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:56.250
 detailed information on crit what 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:58.350
 modules damaged what crew members 

00:04:56.250 --> 00:05:00.780
 crippled most likely not really 

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:02.760
 it will be too deployed and we 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:04.889
 just don't want to give players that 

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:06.630
 number of formations after earlier 

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:08.820
 it was possible to hover over some 

00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:11.160
 module see how much experience is left 

00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:13.350
 studies now can not be screwed 

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:15.960
 forest mapping of missing experience to 

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:17.910
 modules before screwed in patch 82 we 

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:19.680
 planning to do these missing things 

00:05:17.910 --> 00:05:21.960
 Firstly, there will already be a tree 

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:23.610
 yourself secondly when it turns just 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:25.320
 amount of experience remaining for 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:27.720
 research the next module and 

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:30.120
 the module price will be bolted already 

00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:31.650
 studied as it is known learning in 

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:34.380
 the hangar has been completely removed from the game 

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:35.940
 will any other training be done yes 

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:38.280
 Now the company is engaged in wargaming 

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:40.470
 making a new teaching mission 

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:42.600
 let's say this is a whole full map 

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:45.960
 on which player loads on which 

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:47.820
 there is a bunch of tips a bunch of arrows 

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:50.970
 where to go what to press what you do 

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:52.979
 such a complete tutorial with tips 

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:56.430
 voice with text with graphic so 

00:05:52.979 --> 00:05:58.770
 will continue shooting will travel on 

00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:00.840
 some kind of dangerous places when 

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:02.550
 it will probably be leaving soon 

00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:05.600
 now determine the version of the patch but it 

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:05.600
 right in the near future and
