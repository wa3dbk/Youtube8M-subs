time<00:00:36.390> like<00:00:36.630> some<00:00:36.870> people<00:00:37.170> asked<00:00:37.530> so<00:00:38.489> firstly

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
time like some people asked so firstly

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.310 
time like some people asked so firstly
starting<00:00:39.329> off<00:00:39.450> there<00:00:39.660> on<00:00:39.750> the<00:00:39.870> attack<00:00:40.079> than<00:00:40.260> I

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:40.320 
starting off there on the attack than I

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.410 
starting off there on the attack than I
do<00:00:40.379> play<00:00:40.710> ak-47<00:00:41.670> on<00:00:41.760> this<00:00:41.940> map<00:00:42.120> so<00:00:42.149> they

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
do play ak-47 on this map so they

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:43.760 
do play ak-47 on this map so they
probably<00:00:42.629> won't<00:00:42.840> be<00:00:43.020> that<00:00:43.170> much<00:00:43.290> exciting

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:43.770

and<00:01:24.960> then<00:01:25.560> try<00:01:25.770> and<00:01:25.799> make<00:01:25.979> his<00:01:26.100> way<00:01:26.250> up<00:01:26.280> to<00:01:26.520> me

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
and then try and make his way up to me

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.490 
and then try and make his way up to me
to<00:01:26.820> get<00:01:26.909> my<00:01:27.060> a<00:01:27.090> case<00:01:27.479> so<00:01:27.659> we<00:01:27.780> can<00:01:27.930> start<00:01:28.200> Scout

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
to get my a case so we can start Scout

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:34.710 
to get my a case so we can start Scout
in<00:01:28.619> the<00:01:28.650> street

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:34.720 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:43.780 

you

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:43.790 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:45.790 

again<00:01:44.510> I<00:01:44.600> throw<00:01:44.780> smoke<00:01:45.110> to<00:01:45.260> cover<00:01:45.500> the<00:01:45.590> jump

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:45.800 
again I throw smoke to cover the jump

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:47.140 
again I throw smoke to cover the jump
and<00:01:45.920> also<00:01:46.160> throw<00:01:46.340> a<00:01:46.400> needed<00:01:46.700> in<00:01:46.760> the<00:01:46.820> street<00:01:47.030> to

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:47.150 
and also throw a needed in the street to

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:48.730 
and also throw a needed in the street to
try<00:01:47.330> and<00:01:47.420> get<00:01:47.540> killem<00:01:47.840> nests<00:01:48.200> in<00:01:48.350> GG<00:01:48.620> my

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:48.740 
try and get killem nests in GG my

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:50.860 
try and get killem nests in GG my
division<00:01:49.220> but<00:01:49.700> this<00:01:49.820> time<00:01:50.000> I<00:01:50.030> kind<00:01:50.540> of<00:01:50.690> guess

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:50.870 
division but this time I kind of guess

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:52.480 
division but this time I kind of guess
at<00:01:51.020> the<00:01:51.080> SMG<00:01:51.470> weren't<00:01:51.680> pushed<00:01:51.950> since<00:01:52.190> he<00:01:52.280> died

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:52.490 
at the SMG weren't pushed since he died

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.330 
at the SMG weren't pushed since he died
last<00:01:52.700> time<00:01:53.560> so<00:01:54.560> instead<00:01:54.860> I<00:01:54.980> watched<00:01:55.190> the<00:01:55.310> a

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
last time so instead I watched the a

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.310 
last time so instead I watched the a
cross<00:01:55.760> I<00:01:56.060> do<00:01:56.450> just<00:01:56.780> get<00:01:56.900> a<00:01:56.960> glimpse<00:01:57.260> of

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:57.320 
cross I do just get a glimpse of

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:58.570 
cross I do just get a glimpse of
somebody<00:01:57.530> across<00:01:57.770> the<00:01:57.950> name<00:01:58.100> that<00:01:58.220> my<00:01:58.280> team

00:01:58.570 --> 00:01:58.580 
somebody across the name that my team

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.310 
somebody across the name that my team
seemed<00:01:58.880> to<00:01:58.970> be<00:01:59.060> making<00:01:59.330> their<00:01:59.450> way<00:01:59.480> into<00:01:59.750> B<00:02:00.050> so

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320 
seemed to be making their way into B so

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.650 
seemed to be making their way into B so
since<00:02:00.680> I<00:02:00.830> saw<00:02:00.980> him<00:02:01.190> run<00:02:01.400> so<00:02:01.730> why<00:02:01.970> don't<00:02:02.240> I<00:02:02.330> take

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:02.660 
since I saw him run so why don't I take

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:04.030 
since I saw him run so why don't I take
this<00:02:02.840> to<00:02:02.990> my<00:02:03.110> advantage<00:02:03.170> you<00:02:03.620> get<00:02:03.770> across<00:02:03.950> the

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.040 
this to my advantage you get across the

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:09.639 
this to my advantage you get across the
street<00:02:04.460> to<00:02:04.700> try<00:02:04.730> and<00:02:05.000> help<00:02:05.090> out<00:02:05.300> B<00:02:08.560> the<00:02:09.560> reason

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:09.649 
street to try and help out B the reason

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:11.080 
street to try and help out B the reason
I<00:02:09.860> do<00:02:09.920> this<00:02:10.130> because<00:02:10.310> he<00:02:10.550> wouldn't<00:02:10.729> say<00:02:10.850> wide

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:11.090 
I do this because he wouldn't say wide

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:12.730 
I do this because he wouldn't say wide
the<00:02:11.300> chances<00:02:11.660> are<00:02:11.750> he<00:02:11.870> probably<00:02:12.110> won't<00:02:12.320> see<00:02:12.560> me

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:12.740 
the chances are he probably won't see me

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:14.470 
the chances are he probably won't see me
across<00:02:12.860> the<00:02:12.950> street<00:02:13.130> so<00:02:13.910> really<00:02:14.240> I<00:02:14.270> can<00:02:14.450> just

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:14.480 
across the street so really I can just

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.030 
across the street so really I can just
make<00:02:14.780> my<00:02:14.990> way<00:02:15.020> over<00:02:15.290> there<00:02:15.440> and<00:02:15.620> they'll<00:02:15.860> have

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
make my way over there and they'll have

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:29.410 
make my way over there and they'll have
no<00:02:16.220> idea<00:02:16.550> that<00:02:16.670> I'm<00:02:16.790> coming<00:02:16.820> I<00:02:27.910> do<00:02:28.910> get<00:02:29.240> to

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:29.420 
no idea that I'm coming I do get to

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.150 
no idea that I'm coming I do get to
pretty<00:02:29.780> quick<00:02:30.020> kills<00:02:30.350> but<00:02:30.620> get<00:02:30.740> too<00:02:30.890> greedy

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:31.160 
pretty quick kills but get too greedy

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.190 
pretty quick kills but get too greedy

it<00:03:10.310> takes<00:03:10.519> me<00:03:10.700> a<00:03:10.730> while<00:03:10.879> to<00:03:11.090> realize<00:03:11.269> have<00:03:11.689> one

00:03:26.679 --> 00:03:26.689 
the compass the street is open so I make

00:03:26.689 --> 00:03:28.990 
the compass the street is open so I make
my<00:03:26.870> way<00:03:27.019> to<00:03:27.079> guard<00:03:27.409> that<00:03:27.650> as<00:03:27.889> the<00:03:28.579> chances<00:03:28.969> are

my way to guard that as the chances are

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.459 
my way to guard that as the chances are
pretty<00:03:29.239> high<00:03:29.359> for<00:03:29.510> them<00:03:29.840> to<00:03:29.900> want<00:03:30.200> to<00:03:30.319> rotate

00:03:30.459 --> 00:03:30.469 
pretty high for them to want to rotate

00:03:30.469 --> 00:03:32.379 
pretty high for them to want to rotate
around<00:03:30.859> the<00:03:31.159> front<00:03:31.370> of<00:03:31.519> a<00:03:31.639> into<00:03:31.969> the<00:03:32.090> street
