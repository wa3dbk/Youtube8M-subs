00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:19.230 
number and it's clearly stated on the

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:23.779 
number and it's clearly stated on the
jagex<00:00:19.800> wikia<00:00:20.300> what<00:00:21.300> it<00:00:21.420> is<00:00:21.600> and<00:00:21.960> how<00:00:22.650> you<00:00:23.310> do<00:00:23.609> it

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
jagex wikia what it is and how you do it

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.269 
jagex wikia what it is and how you do it
or<00:00:24.090> not<00:00:24.150> really<00:00:24.720> how<00:00:24.840> you<00:00:24.900> do<00:00:25.140> it<00:00:25.289> but<00:00:25.320> the

00:00:26.269 --> 00:00:26.279 
or not really how you do it but the

00:00:26.279 --> 00:00:27.920 
or not really how you do it but the
priority<00:00:26.550> it<00:00:26.970> gives<00:00:27.180> you<00:00:27.330> over<00:00:27.689> another

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
priority it gives you over another

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.759

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
player so it really isn't a glitch it's

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:35.540 
player so it really isn't a glitch it's
legitimate<00:00:32.550> it's<00:00:32.750> by<00:00:33.750> jagex<00:00:34.320> they<00:00:34.829> put<00:00:35.340> it<00:00:35.430> out

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:35.550 
legitimate it's by jagex they put it out

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.360 
legitimate it's by jagex they put it out
there<00:00:35.820> it's<00:00:35.969> just<00:00:36.210> not<00:00:36.420> known<00:00:36.630> by<00:00:36.809> many<00:00:36.960> people

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:37.370 
there it's just not known by many people

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:39.799

pitting<00:00:38.370> up<00:00:38.489> or<00:00:38.670> having<00:00:39.000> pit<00:00:39.210> is<00:00:39.360> best<00:00:39.629> for

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
pitting up or having pit is best for

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:41.840 
pitting up or having pit is best for
stakes<00:00:40.050> like<00:00:40.260> rape<00:00:40.500> hearing<00:00:40.890> in<00:00:41.010> mage<00:00:41.250> boxing

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:41.850 
stakes like rape hearing in mage boxing

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.450 
stakes like rape hearing in mage boxing
and<00:00:42.030> you<00:00:42.989> could<00:00:43.170> have<00:00:43.200> paid<00:00:43.590> for<00:00:43.860> boxing<00:00:44.280> but<00:00:44.399> i

and you could have paid for boxing but i

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:45.950 
and you could have paid for boxing but i
really<00:00:44.820> wouldn't<00:00:44.940> recommend<00:00:45.120> getting<00:00:45.690> it

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960 
really wouldn't recommend getting it

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.440 
really wouldn't recommend getting it
just<00:00:46.230> for<00:00:46.500> boxing<00:00:47.030> next<00:00:48.030> thing<00:00:48.180> you're<00:00:48.300> going

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
just for boxing next thing you're going

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.420 
just for boxing next thing you're going
to<00:00:48.510> want<00:00:48.570> to<00:00:48.750> do<00:00:48.870> is<00:00:49.170> head<00:00:49.680> up<00:00:49.829> here<00:00:50.250> or

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430 
to want to do is head up here or

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.279 
to want to do is head up here or
somewhere<00:00:50.969> secluded<00:00:51.420> from<00:00:51.719> the<00:00:51.960> duel<00:00:52.140> arena

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
somewhere secluded from the duel arena

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:53.750 
somewhere secluded from the duel arena
because<00:00:52.590> you<00:00:52.860> don't<00:00:53.039> really<00:00:53.190> want<00:00:53.460> people

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760 
because you don't really want people

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.360 
because you don't really want people
seeing<00:00:54.030> you<00:00:54.300> that<00:00:54.780> are<00:00:54.870> staking<00:00:55.170> to<00:00:56.129> see<00:00:56.280> you

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
seeing you that are staking to see you

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:57.979 
seeing you that are staking to see you
pit<00:00:56.610> because<00:00:56.879> then<00:00:57.270> they<00:00:57.420> won't<00:00:57.510> stake<00:00:57.809> you

00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
pit because then they won't stake you

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.529 
pit because then they won't stake you
because<00:00:58.320> you<00:00:58.469> have<00:00:58.530> an<00:00:58.649> advantage<00:00:58.890> on<00:00:59.129> them<00:00:59.539> so

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
because you have an advantage on them so

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:01.849 
because you have an advantage on them so

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
are going to walk one step in this case

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.670 
are going to walk one step in this case
I<00:01:14.340> would<00:01:14.610> have<00:01:14.760> paid<00:01:14.970> on<00:01:15.119> him<00:01:15.360> because<00:01:15.930> I<00:01:16.259> have

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
I would have paid on him because I have

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.100 
I would have paid on him because I have
no<00:01:16.890> delay<00:01:17.250> in<00:01:17.460> between<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:18.000> time<00:01:18.210> that<00:01:18.479> he

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
no delay in between the time that he

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.340 
no delay in between the time that he
steps<00:01:19.530> and<00:01:19.890> that<00:01:20.280> I<00:01:20.400> follow<00:01:20.850> him<00:01:21.180> here<00:01:22.049> walk

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:22.350 
steps and that I follow him here walk

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:29.350

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:29.360 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:34.030 

in<00:01:29.600> just<00:01:30.170> one<00:01:30.230> more<00:01:30.500> time<00:01:32.590> now<00:01:33.590> I'm<00:01:33.740> going<00:01:33.920> to

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:34.040 
in just one more time now I'm going to

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.790 
in just one more time now I'm going to
get<00:01:34.160> him<00:01:34.340> to<00:01:34.400> follow<00:01:34.730> me<00:01:34.940> and<00:01:35.510> so<00:01:36.380> you<00:01:36.440> can<00:01:36.620> see

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:36.800 
get him to follow me and so you can see

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.530 
get him to follow me and so you can see
the<00:01:36.920> difference<00:01:37.280> between<00:01:37.490> somebody<00:01:38.000> who<00:01:38.330> has

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:38.540 
the difference between somebody who has

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:43.560 
the difference between somebody who has
pit<00:01:38.870> and<00:01:39.080> somebody<00:01:39.590> who<00:01:39.740> doesn't<00:01:39.980> have<00:01:40.250> fit

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:43.570

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090 
did you see that time delay right there

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.850 
did you see that time delay right there
that<00:01:47.090> time<00:01:47.300> delay<00:01:47.690> it<00:01:47.930> means<00:01:48.260> he<00:01:48.500> doesn't<00:01:48.620> have

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:48.860 
that time delay it means he doesn't have

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:55.360 
that time delay it means he doesn't have
paid<00:01:49.070> on<00:01:49.190> me<00:01:49.780> let's<00:01:50.780> watch<00:01:50.930> again<00:01:52.570> and<00:01:54.370> once

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:12.590 

no<00:02:09.090> delay<00:02:09.450> not<00:02:10.290> at<00:02:10.410> all<00:02:10.850> this<00:02:11.850> right<00:02:12.180> here<00:02:12.420> is<00:02:12.450> a

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:12.600 
no delay not at all this right here is a
