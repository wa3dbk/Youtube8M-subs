00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.020 
the only problem with it was right here
on<00:00:36.250> the<00:00:36.520> iweb<00:00:36.940> it<00:00:37.680> it<00:00:38.680> sort<00:00:39.219> of<00:00:39.280> kind<00:00:39.700> of<00:00:39.789> broke

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:40.030 
on the iweb it it sort of kind of broke

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:41.640 
on the iweb it it sort of kind of broke
right<00:00:40.300> here<00:00:40.480> a<00:00:40.510> little<00:00:40.660> bit<00:00:40.810> so<00:00:40.960> that<00:00:41.170> every

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:41.650 
right here a little bit so that every

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:43.800 
right here a little bit so that every
time<00:00:41.860> I<00:00:42.190> catch<00:00:42.640> a<00:00:42.730> ball<00:00:42.880> up<00:00:43.000> here<00:00:43.300> as<00:00:43.420> you<00:00:43.450> see

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:43.810 
time I catch a ball up here as you see

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:46.740 
time I catch a ball up here as you see
it<00:00:43.930> kind<00:00:44.829> of<00:00:44.890> moved<00:00:45.100> back<00:00:45.340> a<00:00:45.370> little<00:00:45.700> and<00:00:46.120> so

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:46.750 
it kind of moved back a little and so

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:49.860 
it kind of moved back a little and so
what<00:00:47.050> we<00:00:47.170> did<00:00:47.350> was<00:00:47.710> we<00:00:47.950> stuck<00:00:48.370> a<00:00:48.600> couple<00:00:49.600> of

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:49.870 
what we did was we stuck a couple of

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:53.610 
what we did was we stuck a couple of
metal<00:00:50.020> spikes<00:00:50.800> and<00:00:51.070> the<00:00:51.550> iweb<00:00:52.060> and<00:00:52.300> that<00:00:52.620> that

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:53.620 
metal spikes and the iweb and that that

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.130 
metal spikes and the iweb and that that
pretty<00:00:53.920> much<00:00:54.070> did<00:00:54.340> the<00:00:54.460> job<00:00:54.730> it<00:00:55.390> has<00:00:55.660> a<00:00:55.810> little

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:56.140 
pretty much did the job it has a little

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:57.569 
pretty much did the job it has a little
bit<00:00:56.200> more<00:00:56.260> padding<00:00:56.770> than<00:00:56.800> a<00:00:56.950> regular<00:00:57.160> glove

00:00:57.569 --> 00:00:57.579 
bit more padding than a regular glove

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:00.120 
bit more padding than a regular glove
and<00:00:57.910> that<00:00:58.120> adds<00:00:58.420> a<00:00:58.840> little<00:00:59.410> bit<00:00:59.590> to<00:00:59.739> the<00:00:59.950> weight

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:00.130 
and that adds a little bit to the weight

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:05.039 
and that adds a little bit to the weight
but<00:01:00.660> so<00:01:01.660> great<00:01:01.930> go<00:01:02.079> up<00:01:02.670> this<00:01:03.670> actually<00:01:04.449> I<00:01:04.659> liked

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:09.770 

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:13.760 

roads<00:02:10.970> it's<00:02:11.970> where<00:02:12.270> it<00:02:12.450> they<00:02:13.110> they<00:02:13.470> kind<00:02:13.709> of

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:13.770 
roads it's where it they they kind of

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.440 
roads it's where it they they kind of
loosen<00:02:14.190> the<00:02:14.340> fingers<00:02:14.700> a<00:02:14.730> little<00:02:14.910> bit<00:02:15.060> so<00:02:15.420> that

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:15.450 
loosen the fingers a little bit so that

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.080 
loosen the fingers a little bit so that
each<00:02:16.170> thing<00:02:16.590> here<00:02:17.040> can<00:02:17.250> come<00:02:17.430> and<00:02:17.580> move<00:02:17.670> on<00:02:17.910> its

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:18.090 
each thing here can come and move on its

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.060 
each thing here can come and move on its
own<00:02:18.270> and<00:02:18.800> that<00:02:20.060> enables<00:02:21.060> you<00:02:21.239> to<00:02:21.270> have<00:02:21.390> more

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:22.070 
own and that enables you to have more

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:24.380 
own and that enables you to have more
mobility<00:02:23.070> of<00:02:23.340> your<00:02:23.700> own<00:02:23.790> hand

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
mobility of your own hand

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.690 
mobility of your own hand
less<00:02:24.540> than<00:02:24.780> the<00:02:24.840> glove<00:02:25.050> and<00:02:25.410> I<00:02:26.220> didn't<00:02:26.430> really

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:26.700 
less than the glove and I didn't really

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.330 
less than the glove and I didn't really
prefer<00:02:27.330> that<00:02:27.510> when<00:02:27.720> I<00:02:27.750> got<00:02:27.989> it<00:02:28.170> so<00:02:28.380> just<00:02:29.100> kind

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
prefer that when I got it so just kind

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.760 
prefer that when I got it so just kind
of<00:02:29.400> tightened<00:02:29.790> it<00:02:29.880> up<00:02:30.140> like<00:02:31.140> a<00:02:31.170> normal<00:02:31.440> blood

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:31.770 
of tightened it up like a normal blood

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:35.290 
of tightened it up like a normal blood
so<00:02:32.640> the<00:02:32.820> 4d<00:02:33.180> technology<00:02:33.390> doesn't<00:02:34.140> really<00:02:34.290> have

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:35.300 
so the 4d technology doesn't really have

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.150 
so the 4d technology doesn't really have
doesn't<00:02:36.300> really<00:02:36.450> do<00:02:37.110> anything<00:02:37.350> for<00:02:37.590> you<00:02:37.830> and

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160

doesn't really do anything for you and
you're<00:02:38.459> not<00:02:38.489> really<00:02:38.910> I<00:02:39.530> don't<00:02:40.530> really<00:02:40.650> care

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:40.860 
you're not really I don't really care

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.380 
you're not really I don't really care
about<00:02:40.950> it<00:02:41.190> but<00:02:41.420> the<00:02:42.420> the<00:02:43.260> Gucci<00:02:43.709> Leather<00:02:43.950> it's

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850 
it's the finest leather what they do is

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:50.539 
it's the finest leather what they do is
to<00:02:48.060> take<00:02:48.239> in<00:02:48.420> North<00:02:48.660> American<00:02:49.170> cows<00:02:49.410> and<00:02:49.830> that

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:50.549 
to take in North American cows and that

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:53.750 
to take in North American cows and that
they<00:02:50.760> they<00:02:51.540> send<00:02:52.019> the<00:02:52.950> highest<00:02:53.340> quality

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:53.760 
they they send the highest quality

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.050 
they they send the highest quality
leather<00:02:54.060> to<00:02:54.480> Japan<00:02:54.930> and<00:02:55.200> you<00:02:55.260> Gucci<00:02:56.250> what<00:02:56.910> they

leather to Japan and you Gucci what they

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:58.910 
leather to Japan and you Gucci what they
do<00:02:57.120> is<00:02:57.420> they<00:02:57.600> they<00:02:57.810> condition<00:02:58.290> it<00:02:58.590> and<00:02:58.739> they

00:02:58.910 --> 00:02:58.920 
do is they they condition it and they

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.340 
do is they they condition it and they
only<00:02:59.190> condition<00:02:59.790> the<00:03:00.450> highest<00:03:00.810> quality<00:03:01.260> of

leather and so this is what drives the
price<00:03:04.380> up<00:03:04.410> so<00:03:04.860> much<00:03:05.100> imagine<00:03:05.700> this<00:03:05.790> big<00:03:06.120> old
