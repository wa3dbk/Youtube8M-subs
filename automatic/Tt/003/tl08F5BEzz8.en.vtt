in standard form a plus bi form and to

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.420 
in standard form a plus bi form and to
do<00:00:24.660> that<00:00:24.779> we<00:00:25.080> need<00:00:25.230> to<00:00:25.260> multiply<00:00:25.470> the<00:00:25.800> top<00:00:25.980> and

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
do that we need to multiply the top and

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.210 
do that we need to multiply the top and
the<00:00:26.519> bottom<00:00:26.670> by<00:00:27.660> the<00:00:27.689> complex<00:00:28.189> conjugate<00:00:29.189> of

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:29.220

the bottom by the complex conjugate of
the<00:00:29.609> bottom<00:00:29.939> so<00:00:30.269> look<00:00:30.570> at<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:30.900> denominator<00:00:31.790> 4

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
the bottom so look at the denominator 4

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:36.770 
the bottom so look at the denominator 4
plus<00:00:33.059> 2i<00:00:33.710> the<00:00:34.710> conjugate<00:00:35.670> of<00:00:35.700> that<00:00:35.880> is<00:00:36.090> 4<00:00:36.329> minus

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
plus 2i the conjugate of that is 4 minus

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.190 
plus 2i the conjugate of that is 4 minus
2i<00:00:37.020> so<00:00:37.710> I'm<00:00:37.770> going<00:00:37.950> to<00:00:37.980> multiply<00:00:38.129> 4<00:00:39.120> minus<00:00:39.660> 2i

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:42.200 

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.229 

multiplied<00:00:43.200> by<00:00:43.379> this<00:00:43.440> fraction<00:00:44.370> which<00:00:45.210> is

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
multiplied by this fraction which is

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:48.830 
multiplied by this fraction which is
equal<00:00:45.899> to<00:00:46.050> 1<00:00:46.489> so<00:00:47.489> I<00:00:47.520> haven't<00:00:47.820> changed<00:00:48.360> my

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:48.840 
equal to 1 so I haven't changed my

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:50.660 
equal to 1 so I haven't changed my
number<00:00:48.899> still<00:00:49.620> gonna<00:00:49.710> have<00:00:49.890> the<00:00:49.980> same<00:00:50.190> value

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
number still gonna have the same value

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.389 
number still gonna have the same value
still<00:00:50.850> going<00:00:51.030> to<00:00:51.120> be<00:00:51.239> the<00:00:51.449> same<00:00:52.399> mathematical

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
still going to be the same mathematical

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.670 
still going to be the same mathematical
answer<00:00:53.670> just<00:00:54.449> multiplying<00:00:54.870> by<00:00:54.989> 1<00:00:55.140> hasn't

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
answer just multiplying by 1 hasn't

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.889 
answer just multiplying by 1 hasn't
changed<00:00:56.039> it<00:00:56.160> but<00:00:56.789> by<00:00:56.910> using<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.480> complex

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
changed it but by using the complex

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:00.200 
changed it but by using the complex
conjugate<00:00:58.559> of<00:00:58.710> the<00:00:58.920> denominator<00:00:58.949> I'm<00:00:59.879> going

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
conjugate of the denominator I'm going

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.000 
conjugate of the denominator I'm going
to<00:01:00.300> cause<00:01:00.480> all<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:00.870> imaginary<00:01:01.170> parts<00:01:01.859> to

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
to cause all the imaginary parts to

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.090 
to cause all the imaginary parts to
cancel<00:01:02.460> out<00:01:02.640> of<00:01:02.670> the<00:01:02.940> denominator<00:01:03.619> so<00:01:04.619> we're

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100 
cancel out of the denominator so we're

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.800 
cancel out of the denominator so we're
going<00:01:05.220> to<00:01:05.309> be<00:01:05.400> doing<00:01:05.489> a<00:01:05.700> foil<00:01:06.030> here<00:01:06.330> so<00:01:06.630> I'll

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
going to be doing a foil here so I'll

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.570 
going to be doing a foil here so I'll
put<00:01:07.020> parentheses<00:01:07.590> here<00:01:07.799> to<00:01:08.040> remind<00:01:08.369> me<00:01:08.549> that

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
put parentheses here to remind me that

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.460 
put parentheses here to remind me that
I'm<00:01:08.790> multiplying<00:01:08.970> these<00:01:09.600> binomials<00:01:10.350> and

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
I'm multiplying these binomials and

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.620 
I'm multiplying these binomials and
let's<00:01:11.280> think<00:01:11.430> about<00:01:11.580> the<00:01:11.760> foil<00:01:12.000> operation

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
let's think about the foil operation

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.899 
let's think about the foil operation
we'll<00:01:13.170> do<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.439> top<00:01:13.619> first<00:01:13.650> first<00:01:14.520> outer<00:01:14.790> inner

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:14.909 
we'll do the top first first outer inner

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:20.359 
we'll do the top first first outer inner
last<00:01:15.350> 3<00:01:16.350> times<00:01:16.680> 4<00:01:17.100> gives<00:01:17.340> me<00:01:17.640> 12<00:01:18.119> and<00:01:18.799> then<00:01:19.799> 3

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
last 3 times 4 gives me 12 and then 3

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.770 
last 3 times 4 gives me 12 and then 3
times<00:01:20.729> minus<00:01:21.509> 2i<00:01:22.009> will<00:01:23.009> give<00:01:23.130> me<00:01:23.310> a<00:01:23.340> minus<00:01:23.790> 6i

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
times minus 2i will give me a minus 6i

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:31.569 
times minus 2i will give me a minus 6i
and<00:01:26.540> then<00:01:27.540> the<00:01:28.200> inner<00:01:28.460> 5i<00:01:29.460> times<00:01:29.970> 4<00:01:30.450> is<00:01:30.530> plus

00:01:31.569 --> 00:01:31.579 
and then the inner 5i times 4 is plus

00:01:31.579 --> 00:01:32.810 
and then the inner 5i times 4 is plus
20i

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
20i

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:37.100 
20i
and<00:01:33.829> then<00:01:34.829> the<00:01:34.950> last<00:01:35.159> I<00:01:35.490> get<00:01:35.640> 5i<00:01:36.110> times

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
and then the last I get 5i times

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:41.560 
and then the last I get 5i times
negative<00:01:37.470> 2i<00:01:38.329> that<00:01:39.329> gives<00:01:39.540> me<00:01:39.689> negative<00:01:40.439> 10<00:01:41.009> I

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:41.570 
negative 2i that gives me negative 10 I

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:48.109 
negative 2i that gives me negative 10 I
squared<00:01:43.909> now<00:01:44.909> the<00:01:44.970> denominator<00:01:46.159> 4<00:01:47.159> times<00:01:47.610> 4<00:01:48.090> is

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
squared now the denominator 4 times 4 is

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:52.580 
squared now the denominator 4 times 4 is
16<00:01:48.990> and<00:01:49.460> then<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:50.579> outer<00:01:50.790> I<00:01:51.030> have<00:01:51.299> 4<00:01:51.750> times

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:52.590 
16 and then the outer I have 4 times

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.709 
16 and then the outer I have 4 times
minus<00:01:53.280> 2i<00:01:53.930> that's<00:01:54.930> minus<00:01:55.500> 8i<00:01:55.740> and<00:01:56.479> then<00:01:57.479> I<00:01:57.509> have

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
minus 2i that's minus 8i and then I have

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:04.999 
minus 2i that's minus 8i and then I have
2<00:01:58.170> I<00:01:58.200> times<00:01:58.770> 4<00:01:59.340> that's<00:02:00.079> plus<00:02:01.079> 8i<00:02:03.020> and<00:02:04.020> then<00:02:04.979> I

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
2 I times 4 that's plus 8i and then I

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:08.240 
2 I times 4 that's plus 8i and then I
have<00:02:05.250> 2<00:02:05.729> I<00:02:05.759> times<00:02:06.360> negative<00:02:06.780> 2i<00:02:07.250> that's

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
have 2 I times negative 2i that's

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.080 
have 2 I times negative 2i that's
negative<00:02:09.140> 4i<00:02:10.280> squared

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
negative 4i squared

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:15.530 
negative 4i squared
and<00:02:13.050> we'll<00:02:13.650> simplify<00:02:13.980> this<00:02:14.310> now<00:02:14.489> let's<00:02:15.330> look

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
and we'll simplify this now let's look

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.830 
and we'll simplify this now let's look
at<00:02:15.720> the<00:02:15.930> numerator<00:02:16.470> I<00:02:16.709> have<00:02:17.250> 12<00:02:17.819> and<00:02:18.209> then<00:02:18.750> I'll

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
at the numerator I have 12 and then I'll

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.770 
at the numerator I have 12 and then I'll
combine<00:02:19.050> terms<00:02:19.650> here<00:02:19.980> my<00:02:20.130> minus<00:02:20.580> 6i<00:02:21.090> and<00:02:21.390> plus

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
combine terms here my minus 6i and plus

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:29.500 
combine terms here my minus 6i and plus
20<00:02:22.200> I<00:02:22.610> combine<00:02:23.610> to<00:02:24.360> give<00:02:24.510> me<00:02:24.540> a<00:02:24.720> plus<00:02:25.319> 14i<00:02:28.400> and

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
20 I combine to give me a plus 14i and

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.470 
20 I combine to give me a plus 14i and
then<00:02:30.510> this<00:02:30.660> is<00:02:30.870> minus<00:02:31.349> 10<00:02:32.069> times<00:02:32.580> I<00:02:32.849> squared

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
then this is minus 10 times I squared

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.990 
then this is minus 10 times I squared
and<00:02:33.930> the<00:02:34.050> I<00:02:34.080> squared<00:02:34.739> remember<00:02:35.010> is<00:02:35.580> negative<00:02:36.569> 1

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:38.000 
and the I squared remember is negative 1

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.940 
and the I squared remember is negative 1
okay<00:02:39.000> so<00:02:39.239> that'll<00:02:39.540> simplify<00:02:39.720> some<00:02:40.230> more<00:02:40.410> but

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:40.950 
okay so that'll simplify some more but

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.800 
okay so that'll simplify some more but
let's<00:02:41.099> look<00:02:41.220> at<00:02:41.340> the<00:02:41.489> denominator<00:02:41.660> look<00:02:42.660> down

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
let's look at the denominator look down

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:47.000 
let's look at the denominator look down
here<00:02:42.989> the<00:02:43.140> minus<00:02:43.590> 8i<00:02:44.130> and<00:02:44.549> the<00:02:45.239> plus<00:02:45.510> 8i<00:02:46.010> cancel

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.010 
here the minus 8i and the plus 8i cancel

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.500 
here the minus 8i and the plus 8i cancel
each<00:02:47.100> other<00:02:47.250> out<00:02:47.840> and<00:02:48.840> we're<00:02:49.080> left<00:02:49.230> with<00:02:49.470> 16

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.510 
each other out and we're left with 16

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.530 
each other out and we're left with 16
minus<00:02:51.680> 4i<00:02:52.680> squared<00:02:53.220> and<00:02:53.489> again<00:02:53.610> the<00:02:53.880> I<00:02:53.910> squared

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:54.540 
minus 4i squared and again the I squared

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.880 
minus 4i squared and again the I squared
is<00:02:55.290> negative<00:02:55.799> 1<00:02:56.959> so<00:02:57.959> let's<00:02:58.200> simplify<00:02:58.410> it<00:02:58.739> a

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:58.890 
is negative 1 so let's simplify it a

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.449 
is negative 1 so let's simplify it a
little<00:02:58.920> bit<00:02:59.190> further<00:02:59.400> I<00:02:59.700> can<00:03:00.180> combine<00:03:00.840> this<00:03:01.459> 12

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
little bit further I can combine this 12

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:06.800 
little bit further I can combine this 12
and<00:03:02.910> this<00:03:04.160> minus<00:03:05.160> negative<00:03:05.580> 10<00:03:06.090> so<00:03:06.330> that's<00:03:06.510> 12

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 
and this minus negative 10 so that's 12

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:12.920 
and this minus negative 10 so that's 12
plus<00:03:07.049> 10<00:03:07.380> that's<00:03:07.410> 22<00:03:08.959> so<00:03:09.959> I<00:03:09.989> have<00:03:10.230> 22<00:03:10.940> plus<00:03:11.940> 14i

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:12.930 
plus 10 that's 22 so I have 22 plus 14i

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:18.110 
plus 10 that's 22 so I have 22 plus 14i
up<00:03:13.590> top<00:03:14.069> and<00:03:14.610> on<00:03:15.330> the<00:03:15.360> bottom<00:03:15.450> I<00:03:15.840> have<00:03:15.870> 16<00:03:17.120> plus

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:18.120 
up top and on the bottom I have 16 plus

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:23.750 
up top and on the bottom I have 16 plus
4<00:03:19.079> or<00:03:19.680> 20<00:03:20.600> and<00:03:21.600> I<00:03:22.500> can<00:03:22.680> simplify<00:03:22.950> this<00:03:23.160> one<00:03:23.459> step

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:23.760 
4 or 20 and I can simplify this one step

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.000 
4 or 20 and I can simplify this one step
further<00:03:23.790> just<00:03:24.390> by<00:03:25.019> dividing<00:03:25.170> everything<00:03:25.680> by<00:03:25.829> 2

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
further just by dividing everything by 2

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:31.670 
further just by dividing everything by 2
this<00:03:26.400> is<00:03:26.609> going<00:03:26.670> to<00:03:26.940> equal<00:03:27.530> 11<00:03:28.609> plus<00:03:29.609> 7i<00:03:30.680> over

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
this is going to equal 11 plus 7i over

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.440 
this is going to equal 11 plus 7i over
10<00:03:31.950> and<00:03:32.130> if<00:03:32.609> you<00:03:32.670> want<00:03:32.819> to<00:03:32.880> put<00:03:33.000> it<00:03:33.090> in<00:03:33.209> standard

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:33.450 
10 and if you want to put it in standard

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:39.170 
10 and if you want to put it in standard
form<00:03:33.690> you<00:03:34.170> could<00:03:34.319> write<00:03:35.000> 11<00:03:36.000> tenths<00:03:36.560> plus<00:03:38.180> 7/10

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
form you could write 11 tenths plus 7/10

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.390 
form you could write 11 tenths plus 7/10
I<00:03:39.329> just<00:03:40.260> split<00:03:40.500> this<00:03:40.739> up<00:03:40.920> into<00:03:41.069> two<00:03:41.220> fractions

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:41.400 
I just split this up into two fractions

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.949 
I just split this up into two fractions
and<00:03:42.060> again<00:03:42.900> most<00:03:43.530> people<00:03:43.819> would<00:03:44.819> take<00:03:45.060> this<00:03:45.540> or

00:03:45.949 --> 00:03:45.959 
and again most people would take this or

00:03:45.959 --> 00:03:48.319 
and again most people would take this or
this<00:03:46.680> as<00:03:46.950> an<00:03:47.220> answer<00:03:47.579> but<00:03:48.090> if<00:03:48.209> you're

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:48.329 
this as an answer but if you're

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:50.000 
this as an answer but if you're
specifically<00:03:48.900> told<00:03:49.079> to<00:03:49.290> write<00:03:49.500> your<00:03:49.709> answer

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:50.010 
specifically told to write your answer

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:51.620 
specifically told to write your answer
in<00:03:50.040> standard<00:03:50.519> form<00:03:51.000> you<00:03:51.150> want<00:03:51.209> to<00:03:51.359> write<00:03:51.480> it

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:51.630 
in standard form you want to write it

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:56.539 
in standard form you want to write it
like<00:03:51.750> this<00:03:52.019> this<00:03:52.980> is<00:03:53.040> a<00:03:53.430> plus<00:03:54.030> bi<00:03:54.359> form<00:03:55.049> a<00:03:55.549> in

00:03:56.539 --> 00:03:56.549 
like this this is a plus bi form a in

00:03:56.549 --> 00:03:59.750 
like this this is a plus bi form a in
this<00:03:56.639> case<00:03:56.880> is<00:03:57.060> 11<00:03:57.389> tenths<00:03:57.720> B<00:03:58.319> is<00:03:58.470> 7<00:03:58.680> tenths<00:03:59.040> so

00:03:59.750 --> 00:03:59.760 
this case is 11 tenths B is 7 tenths so

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.420 
this case is 11 tenths B is 7 tenths so
the<00:03:59.880> point<00:04:00.120> here<00:04:00.200> complex<00:04:01.200> conjugates<00:04:01.799> allow

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:02.430 
the point here complex conjugates allow

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:04.910 
the point here complex conjugates allow
us<00:04:02.670> to<00:04:02.819> do<00:04:02.970> a<00:04:03.000> division<00:04:03.359> problem<00:04:03.569> and<00:04:04.139> allow<00:04:04.709> us

00:04:04.910 --> 00:04:04.920 
us to do a division problem and allow us

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.430 
us to do a division problem and allow us
to<00:04:05.100> get<00:04:05.280> all<00:04:05.430> the<00:04:05.549> imaginary<00:04:05.880> parts<00:04:06.720> out<00:04:06.930> of

00:04:07.430 --> 00:04:07.440 
to get all the imaginary parts out of

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.170 
to get all the imaginary parts out of
the<00:04:07.620> denominator<00:04:07.769> so<00:04:08.459> that<00:04:08.489> we<00:04:08.670> can<00:04:08.819> express

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
the denominator so that we can express

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.549 
the denominator so that we can express
our<00:04:09.480> final<00:04:09.870> answer<00:04:10.260> in<00:04:10.410> standard<00:04:10.980> form
