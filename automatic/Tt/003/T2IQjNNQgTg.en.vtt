anybody finally announced the feria
graphics<00:00:05.580> card<00:00:05.879> what<00:00:06.779> this<00:00:06.960> is<00:00:07.170> is<00:00:07.500> Indies

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
graphics card what this is is Indies

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:11.509 
graphics card what this is is Indies
next-generation<00:00:08.760> architecture<00:00:09.830> Fiji<00:00:10.830> and<00:00:11.130> it

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519 
next-generation architecture Fiji and it

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.480 
next-generation architecture Fiji and it
also<00:00:11.670> features<00:00:12.230> hbm<00:00:13.230> high<00:00:13.620> bandwidth<00:00:14.099> memory

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:14.490 
also features hbm high bandwidth memory

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.540 
also features hbm high bandwidth memory
and<00:00:15.560> basically<00:00:16.560> we've<00:00:16.859> all<00:00:17.010> been<00:00:17.160> waiting<00:00:17.310> a

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:17.550 
and basically we've all been waiting a

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.550 
and basically we've all been waiting a
long<00:00:17.580> time<00:00:17.760> for<00:00:18.029> it<00:00:18.359> and<00:00:18.600> we<00:00:18.869> finally<00:00:19.199> get<00:00:19.380> it

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
long time for it and we finally get it

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.810 
long time for it and we finally get it
and<00:00:19.770> not<00:00:20.430> one<00:00:20.880> but<00:00:21.689> five<00:00:22.109> versions<00:00:22.640> I'm<00:00:23.640> going

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
and not one but five versions I'm going

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.700 
and not one but five versions I'm going
to<00:00:23.880> run<00:00:24.119> you<00:00:24.150> down<00:00:24.510> those<00:00:24.840> versions<00:00:25.140> so<00:00:25.619> you

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:25.710 
to run you down those versions so you

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:27.920 
to run you down those versions so you
understand<00:00:26.220> them<00:00:26.460> and<00:00:26.640> see<00:00:27.420> what<00:00:27.570> they<00:00:27.599> fit

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
understand them and see what they fit

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.810 
understand them and see what they fit
but<00:00:28.710> I'm<00:00:28.800> also<00:00:28.949> going<00:00:29.220> to<00:00:29.340> explain<00:00:29.580> a<00:00:29.640> little

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:29.820 
but I'm also going to explain a little

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.990 
but I'm also going to explain a little
bit<00:00:30.029> about<00:00:30.510> Fiji<00:00:31.289> itself<00:00:31.949> what<00:00:32.550> makes<00:00:32.730> very

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
bit about Fiji itself what makes very

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.850 
bit about Fiji itself what makes very
great<00:00:33.329> is<00:00:33.510> the<00:00:33.719> high<00:00:33.840> bandwidth<00:00:34.260> memory<00:00:34.590> and

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
great is the high bandwidth memory and

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.979 
great is the high bandwidth memory and
what<00:00:35.010> that<00:00:35.190> is<00:00:35.219> is<00:00:35.370> vram<00:00:35.969> belt<00:00:36.300> onto<00:00:36.540> the<00:00:36.780> scene

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:36.989 
what that is is vram belt onto the scene

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.190 
what that is is vram belt onto the scene
you<00:00:37.079> die<00:00:37.320> as<00:00:37.739> actual<00:00:38.250> GP<00:00:38.579> course<00:00:38.850> itself<00:00:39.239> so

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 
you die as actual GP course itself so

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.400 
you die as actual GP course itself so
it's<00:00:40.649> a<00:00:40.770> lot<00:00:40.920> smaller<00:00:41.190> it<00:00:42.000> saves<00:00:42.450> electricity

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
it's a lot smaller it saves electricity

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:47.180 
it's a lot smaller it saves electricity
and<00:00:44.190> a<00:00:44.370> lot<00:00:44.489> faster<00:00:44.760> so<00:00:45.660> even<00:00:46.110> though<00:00:46.140> hbm<00:00:46.890> is

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
and a lot faster so even though hbm is

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.310 
and a lot faster so even though hbm is
running<00:00:47.520> at<00:00:47.640> a<00:00:47.670> thousand<00:00:48.420> megahertz<00:00:48.840> verses

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320 
running at a thousand megahertz verses

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.529 
running at a thousand megahertz verses
seven<00:00:49.710> thousand<00:00:50.160> five<00:00:50.399> thousand<00:00:50.910> ish<00:00:51.030> around

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
seven thousand five thousand ish around

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.520 
seven thousand five thousand ish around
a<00:00:51.829> medias<00:00:52.829> other<00:00:53.370> lineups<00:00:53.969> it<00:00:54.719> has<00:00:55.170> a<00:00:55.199> much

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
a medias other lineups it has a much

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:00.200 
a medias other lineups it has a much
larger<00:00:55.949> bus<00:00:57.320> 496<00:00:58.320> bits<00:00:58.770> compared<00:00:59.370> to<00:00:59.579> 512

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
larger bus 496 bits compared to 512

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.150 
larger bus 496 bits compared to 512
that's<00:01:00.510> the<00:01:00.690> biggest<00:01:00.899> we<00:01:01.170> normally<00:01:01.649> see<00:01:01.890> and

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
that's the biggest we normally see and

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.240 
that's the biggest we normally see and
so<00:01:03.120> even<00:01:03.570> though<00:01:03.690> it's<00:01:03.960> clock<00:01:04.409> a<00:01:04.439> lot<00:01:04.710> slower

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
so even though it's clock a lot slower

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.330 
so even though it's clock a lot slower
still<00:01:05.970> achieves<00:01:06.299> a<00:01:06.390> memory<00:01:06.659> bandwidth<00:01:07.080> of<00:01:07.340> 512

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
still achieves a memory bandwidth of 512

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.490 
still achieves a memory bandwidth of 512
megabytes<00:01:08.790> a<00:01:08.909> second<00:01:09.360> and<00:01:09.600> for<00:01:09.990> reference<00:01:10.140> of

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.500 
megabytes a second and for reference of

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.090 
megabytes a second and for reference of
290x<00:01:11.040> is<00:01:11.250> about<00:01:11.630> 320<00:01:12.630> Amy's<00:01:13.409> hoping<00:01:13.799> that<00:01:13.950> this

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
290x is about 320 Amy's hoping that this

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.310 
290x is about 320 Amy's hoping that this
removes<00:01:14.520> the<00:01:14.880> vram<00:01:15.330> bottleneck<00:01:15.810> that<00:01:15.840> they

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
removes the vram bottleneck that they

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.929 
removes the vram bottleneck that they
say<00:01:16.590> is<00:01:16.650> the<00:01:17.040> biggest<00:01:17.340> problem<00:01:17.790> with<00:01:17.880> our

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
say is the biggest problem with our

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.749 
say is the biggest problem with our
graphics<00:01:18.360> cards<00:01:18.600> of<00:01:18.780> today<00:01:19.200> and<00:01:19.759> basically

00:01:20.749 --> 00:01:20.759 
graphics cards of today and basically

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:23.719 
graphics cards of today and basically
it's<00:01:21.390> really<00:01:21.600> fast<00:01:21.810> and<00:01:22.020> efficient<00:01:22.409> so<00:01:22.729> I'm

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:23.729 
it's really fast and efficient so I'm

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:25.880 
it's really fast and efficient so I'm
all<00:01:23.880> for<00:01:24.119> it<00:01:24.409> starting<00:01:25.409> from<00:01:25.439> top<00:01:25.710> to<00:01:25.740> bottom

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
all for it starting from top to bottom

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.700 
all for it starting from top to bottom
the<00:01:26.369> first<00:01:26.610> thing<00:01:26.790> we<00:01:26.939> have<00:01:26.970> is<00:01:27.509> the<00:01:28.020> theory<00:01:28.409> x

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
the first thing we have is the theory x

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.359 
the first thing we have is the theory x
2<00:01:29.610> and<00:01:30.390> what<00:01:30.509> that<00:01:30.540> is<00:01:30.689> is<00:01:30.810> too<00:01:31.259> full<00:01:31.619> core<00:01:32.009> fury

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369

we're<00:01:40.890> going<00:01:41.040> to<00:01:41.100> have<00:01:41.340> a<00:01:41.579> lot<00:01:41.850> of<00:01:41.909> power<00:01:42.150> here

00:01:42.499 --> 00:01:42.509 
we're going to have a lot of power here

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:45.050 
we're going to have a lot of power here
and<00:01:42.710> honestly<00:01:43.710> it's<00:01:44.070> going<00:01:44.310> to<00:01:44.369> be<00:01:44.490> ridiculous

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
and honestly it's going to be ridiculous

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:47.690 
and honestly it's going to be ridiculous
next<00:01:45.930> we<00:01:46.049> have<00:01:46.200> the<00:01:46.259> fury<00:01:46.710> x<00:01:46.979> which<00:01:47.369> is<00:01:47.399> the

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
next we have the fury x which is the

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:49.880 
next we have the fury x which is the
