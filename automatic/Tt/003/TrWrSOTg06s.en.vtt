most<00:00:31.270> planets<00:00:31.809> seem<00:00:32.050> to<00:00:32.169> have<00:00:32.320> some<00:00:32.559> sort<00:00:33.040> of

most planets seem to have some sort of

00:00:44.290 --> 00:00:45.960 
been able to observe to sustain life or
if<00:00:44.410> I<00:00:44.560> knew<00:00:44.710> the<00:00:44.860> answer<00:00:44.890> that<00:00:45.250> question<00:00:45.730> I

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:45.970 
if I knew the answer that question I

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:48.240 
if I knew the answer that question I
would<00:00:46.570> really<00:00:46.870> be<00:00:46.990> happy<00:00:47.200> no<00:00:47.650> one<00:00:47.890> really

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:48.250 
would really be happy no one really

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:51.390 
would really be happy no one really
knows<00:00:48.460> but<00:00:49.240> it<00:00:49.420> looks<00:00:49.750> like<00:00:49.930> it's<00:00:50.710> actually<00:00:51.370> a

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:51.400 
knows but it looks like it's actually a

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.300 
knows but it looks like it's actually a
symbiotic<00:00:52.000> connection<00:00:52.690> between<00:00:53.350> life<00:00:54.040> on

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:56.500 
Earth and the atmosphere of the earth

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.280 
Earth and the atmosphere of the earth
that<00:00:57.010> is<00:00:57.220> when<00:00:57.850> we<00:00:58.210> know<00:00:58.660> that<00:00:58.840> when<00:00:58.960> the<00:00:59.110> earth

00:00:59.280 --> 00:00:59.290 
that is when we know that when the earth

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:01.229 
that is when we know that when the earth
was<00:00:59.320> very<00:00:59.800> young<00:01:00.070> its<00:01:00.460> atmosphere<00:01:00.730> was<00:01:01.150> very

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:01.239 
was very young its atmosphere was very

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:04.049 
was very young its atmosphere was very
different<00:01:01.690> for<00:01:02.620> example<00:01:03.100> there<00:01:03.340> was<00:01:03.460> very

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:04.059 
different for example there was very

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:07.340 
different for example there was very
little<00:01:04.299> oxygen<00:01:04.839> but<00:01:05.649> with<00:01:05.920> the<00:01:06.130> rise<00:01:06.369> of

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350 
little oxygen but with the rise of

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.810 
little oxygen but with the rise of
plants<00:01:08.350> that<00:01:08.380> release<00:01:08.920> oxygen<00:01:09.430> into<00:01:09.790> the

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:09.820 
plants that release oxygen into the

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:12.149 
plants that release oxygen into the
atmosphere<00:01:09.970> the<00:01:10.659> amount<00:01:10.960> built<00:01:11.229> up<00:01:11.470> and<00:01:11.799> that

00:01:12.149 --> 00:01:12.159 
atmosphere the amount built up and that

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:15.600 
atmosphere the amount built up and that
made<00:01:12.369> it<00:01:12.399> possible<00:01:12.520> for<00:01:13.470> animals<00:01:14.470> to<00:01:14.979> evolve

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:15.610 
made it possible for animals to evolve

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.840 
made it possible for animals to evolve
on<00:01:16.359> land<00:01:16.689> and<00:01:17.020> so<00:01:17.499> our<00:01:18.249> atmosphere<00:01:18.729> is<00:01:18.819> very

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:18.850 
on land and so our atmosphere is very

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:20.969 
on land and so our atmosphere is very
different<00:01:19.420> than<00:01:19.630> any<00:01:19.990> of<00:01:20.200> the<00:01:20.350> others<00:01:20.679> in<00:01:20.710> our

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:20.979 
different than any of the others in our

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:23.580 
different than any of the others in our
solar<00:01:21.280> system<00:01:21.759> and<00:01:21.880> that's<00:01:22.450> probably<00:01:22.840> related

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:23.590 
solar system and that's probably related

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.859 
solar system and that's probably related
to<00:01:23.819> the<00:01:24.819> biology<00:01:25.509> on<00:01:25.719> earth<00:01:25.990> we're<00:01:26.799> very<00:01:27.039> lucky

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
to the biology on earth we're very lucky

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:30.330 
to the biology on earth we're very lucky
so<00:01:28.869> we've<00:01:29.109> talked<00:01:29.350> about<00:01:29.499> planets<00:01:30.069> and<00:01:30.219> we've

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:30.340 
so we've talked about planets and we've

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.459 
so we've talked about planets and we've
talked<00:01:30.579> about<00:01:30.759> moons<00:01:31.179> we<00:01:31.479> talked<00:01:31.780> about<00:01:31.929> the

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:32.469 
talked about moons we talked about the

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:34.919 
talked about moons we talked about the
Sun<00:01:32.709> so<00:01:33.310> what<00:01:33.459> about<00:01:33.549> the<00:01:33.819> asteroid<00:01:34.299> belt<00:01:34.329> how

00:01:34.919 --> 00:01:34.929 
Sun so what about the asteroid belt how

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:37.139 
Sun so what about the asteroid belt how
did<00:01:35.139> it<00:01:35.350> form<00:01:35.740> and<00:01:36.009> why<00:01:36.340> is<00:01:36.459> it<00:01:36.520> different<00:01:36.789> from

00:01:37.139 --> 00:01:37.149 
did it form and why is it different from

00:01:37.149 --> 00:01:39.510 
did it form and why is it different from
the<00:01:37.569> other<00:01:37.780> bigger<00:01:38.499> objects<00:01:39.069> in<00:01:39.219> our<00:01:39.340> solar

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 
the other bigger objects in our solar

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.519 
the other bigger objects in our solar
system<00:01:39.939> well<00:01:40.359> the<00:01:40.479> asteroid<00:01:40.959> belt<00:01:40.990> which<00:01:41.499> is

00:01:41.519 --> 00:01:41.529 
system well the asteroid belt which is

00:01:41.529 --> 00:01:44.010 
system well the asteroid belt which is
between<00:01:41.829> Mars<00:01:42.310> and<00:01:42.429> Jupiter<00:01:42.609> is<00:01:43.179> believed<00:01:43.779> to

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:44.020 
between Mars and Jupiter is believed to

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.010 
between Mars and Jupiter is believed to
be<00:01:44.200> a<00:01:44.469> place<00:01:45.159> where<00:01:45.189> a<00:01:45.909> planet<00:01:46.509> could<00:01:46.779> have

00:01:47.010 --> 00:01:47.020 
be a place where a planet could have

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:49.199 
be a place where a planet could have
formed<00:01:47.319> that<00:01:47.560> never<00:01:47.829> did<00:01:48.159> probably<00:01:48.909> because

00:01:49.199 --> 00:01:49.209 
formed that never did probably because

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:51.239 
formed that never did probably because
Jupiter's<00:01:49.719> nearby<00:01:50.079> gravity<00:01:50.619> disturbed<00:01:51.130> the

00:01:51.239 --> 00:01:51.249 
Jupiter's nearby gravity disturbed the

00:01:51.249 --> 00:01:53.219 
Jupiter's nearby gravity disturbed the
region<00:01:51.639> so<00:01:52.149> that<00:01:52.179> we<00:01:52.420> couldn't<00:01:52.719> accrete<00:01:53.079> a

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:53.229 
region so that we couldn't accrete a

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:55.109 
region so that we couldn't accrete a
large<00:01:53.590> enough<00:01:53.829> planet<00:01:54.340> and<00:01:54.490> things<00:01:54.880> never

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:55.119 
large enough planet and things never

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:57.359 
large enough planet and things never
really<00:01:55.479> got<00:01:55.659> past<00:01:56.020> the<00:01:56.229> size<00:01:56.439> of<00:01:56.770> dwarf

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:57.369 
really got past the size of dwarf

00:01:57.369 --> 00:01:59.069 
really got past the size of dwarf
planets<00:01:57.759> like<00:01:57.939> series<00:01:58.420> that<00:01:58.659> are<00:01:58.779> there

00:01:59.069 --> 00:01:59.079 
planets like series that are there

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:00.989 
planets like series that are there
interestingly<00:01:59.770> enough<00:02:00.310> there's<00:02:00.700> another

00:02:00.989 --> 00:02:00.999 
interestingly enough there's another

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:02.849 
interestingly enough there's another
belt<00:02:01.359> in<00:02:01.569> our<00:02:01.689> solar<00:02:01.959> system<00:02:02.349> color<00:02:02.560> Kuiper

dwarf<00:02:08.500> planets<00:02:08.979> and<00:02:09.160> we<00:02:10.030> see<00:02:10.270> those<00:02:10.420> same

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
dwarf planets and we see those same

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
stars how many solar systems are there

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:16.530 
stars how many solar systems are there
in<00:02:15.459> the<00:02:15.610> universe

in the universe

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:18.839 
in the universe
well<00:02:16.719> that's<00:02:17.110> a<00:02:17.290> big<00:02:17.469> number<00:02:17.680> in<00:02:18.340> our<00:02:18.579> galaxy

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:18.849 
well that's a big number in our galaxy

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:21.569 
well that's a big number in our galaxy
there<00:02:19.629> are<00:02:19.870> between<00:02:20.650> one<00:02:21.040> and<00:02:21.069> two<00:02:21.340> hundred

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:21.579

there are between one and two hundred
billion<00:02:22.180> stars<00:02:22.209> and<00:02:22.959> it's<00:02:23.530> beginning<00:02:24.459> to<00:02:24.489> look

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:24.670 
billion stars and it's beginning to look

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:27.479 
billion stars and it's beginning to look
like<00:02:24.909> solar<00:02:25.480> systems<00:02:25.989> are<00:02:26.290> common<00:02:26.920> they're

00:02:27.479 --> 00:02:27.489 
like solar systems are common they're

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:29.729 
like solar systems are common they're
certainly<00:02:27.909> not<00:02:28.000> rare<00:02:28.540> we<00:02:29.170> already<00:02:29.379> know<00:02:29.709> that

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:29.739 
certainly not rare we already know that

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:31.770 
certainly not rare we already know that
more<00:02:30.370> than<00:02:30.400> ten<00:02:30.760> percent<00:02:31.120> of<00:02:31.180> the<00:02:31.239> stars<00:02:31.510> have

more than ten percent of the stars have

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.899 
more than ten percent of the stars have
solar<00:02:32.109> systems<00:02:32.650> it<00:02:32.890> may<00:02:33.159> be<00:02:33.220> that<00:02:33.310> almost<00:02:33.700> one

00:02:33.899 --> 00:02:33.909 
solar systems it may be that almost one

solar systems it may be that almost one
hundred<00:02:33.970> percent<00:02:34.180> dude<00:02:34.720> but<00:02:35.530> we<00:02:35.650> just<00:02:35.829> can't

00:02:36.179 --> 00:02:36.189 
hundred percent dude but we just can't

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:38.069 
hundred percent dude but we just can't
see<00:02:36.549> yet<00:02:36.760> because<00:02:37.120> our<00:02:37.239> techniques<00:02:37.750> aren't

good enough yet to be sure that we're

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:42.819 
finding them all so in our galaxy alone

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:46.589 
finding them all so in our galaxy alone
there<00:02:43.750> are<00:02:43.930> probably<00:02:44.200> between<00:02:44.909> 20<00:02:45.909> and<00:02:46.060> 100

00:02:46.589 --> 00:02:46.599

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:49.559 
there are probably between 20 and 100
billion<00:02:47.260> solar<00:02:47.560> systems<00:02:48.069> and<00:02:48.370> our<00:02:48.700> galaxy<00:02:49.329> is

one<00:02:50.049> of<00:02:50.349> just<00:02:50.709> billions<00:02:51.750> so<00:02:52.750> it's<00:02:52.989> a<00:02:53.109> very

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:53.139 
one of just billions so it's a very

more than one son I once heard from my

more than one son I once heard from my

astronomy professor when I was in high

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:16.710 
astronomy professor when I was in high
school<00:03:14.319> that<00:03:14.709> if<00:03:15.069> Jupiter<00:03:15.609> had<00:03:15.849> been<00:03:16.060> larger

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:16.720 
school that if Jupiter had been larger

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.140 
school that if Jupiter had been larger
we<00:03:16.959> might<00:03:17.230> have<00:03:17.379> had<00:03:17.530> a<00:03:17.590> tucson<00:03:18.280> solar<00:03:18.519> system

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:19.150 
we might have had a tucson solar system

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.869 
we might have had a tucson solar system
and<00:03:19.419> he<00:03:20.049> also<00:03:20.200> said<00:03:20.769> that<00:03:20.799> it's<00:03:21.159> very<00:03:21.280> common

00:03:21.869 --> 00:03:21.879 
and he also said that it's very common

00:03:21.879 --> 00:03:24.629 
and he also said that it's very common
to<00:03:22.060> have<00:03:22.540> binary<00:03:22.870> star<00:03:23.379> systems<00:03:23.889> in<00:03:24.099> fact<00:03:24.370> most

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:24.639 
to have binary star systems in fact most

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:26.689 
to have binary star systems in fact most
stars<00:03:25.030> are<00:03:25.329> in<00:03:25.750> multiple<00:03:26.409> star<00:03:26.620> systems

00:03:26.689 --> 00:03:26.699 
stars are in multiple star systems

00:03:26.699 --> 00:03:30.930 
stars are in multiple star systems
binaries<00:03:27.699> triples<00:03:28.510> even<00:03:28.989> quadruples<00:03:29.940> rarely

five<00:03:31.269> or<00:03:31.449> six<00:03:31.690> sons<00:03:31.989> we<00:03:32.739> have<00:03:32.919> already<00:03:33.340> found

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:33.579 
five or six sons we have already found

five or six sons we have already found
examples<00:03:34.180> of<00:03:34.769> planets<00:03:35.769> orbiting<00:03:36.579> in<00:03:36.699> binary

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:37.120 
examples of planets orbiting in binary

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.800 
examples of planets orbiting in binary

the time I would be really interesting

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.580 
the time I would be really interesting

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590

00:03:48.869 --> 00:03:48.879 
every day my last question is about life

00:03:48.879 --> 00:03:50.430 
every day my last question is about life
we<00:03:49.269> talked<00:03:49.540> about<00:03:49.720> the<00:03:50.109> symbiotic

we talked about the symbiotic

solar<00:04:02.049> systems<00:04:02.500> do<00:04:03.280> you<00:04:03.340> think<00:04:03.849> life<00:04:04.120> has

solar systems do you think life has

well<00:04:07.880> I<00:04:07.910> tend<00:04:08.270> to<00:04:08.360> think<00:04:08.630> that<00:04:09.220> the<00:04:10.220> odds<00:04:10.370> are

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:10.550 
well I tend to think that the odds are

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:13.120 
well I tend to think that the odds are
certainly<00:04:10.730> in<00:04:11.090> that<00:04:11.900> favor<00:04:12.170> but<00:04:12.830> you<00:04:13.010> know

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:13.130 
certainly in that favor but you know

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:14.830 
certainly in that favor but you know
until<00:04:13.580> we<00:04:13.760> have<00:04:13.910> the<00:04:13.940> evidence<00:04:14.240> as<00:04:14.780> a

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:17.390 
scientist I have to say the jury's still

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:19.900 
scientist I have to say the jury's still
out<00:04:17.600> and<00:04:18.140> that's<00:04:18.950> what's<00:04:19.190> so<00:04:19.370> exciting<00:04:19.670> about

out and that's what's so exciting about

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:22.570 
out and that's what's so exciting about
scientific<00:04:20.510> exploration<00:04:21.380> is<00:04:21.530> you<00:04:22.220> get<00:04:22.460> to

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:22.580 
scientific exploration is you get to

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:24.610 
scientific exploration is you get to
pose<00:04:22.790> these<00:04:23.060> really<00:04:23.600> fascinating<00:04:24.170> questions
