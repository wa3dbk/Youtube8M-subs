an<00:03:04.819> adage<00:03:05.180> see<00:03:05.750> one<00:03:05.989> do<00:03:06.319> one<00:03:06.349> teach<00:03:06.560> one<00:03:07.120> this

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:08.120 
an adage see one do one teach one this

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.150 
an adage see one do one teach one this
meant<00:03:08.480> that<00:03:08.629> we<00:03:09.110> would<00:03:09.319> watch<00:03:09.560> our<00:03:09.799> senior

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:10.160 
meant that we would watch our senior

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:13.240 
meant that we would watch our senior
resident<00:03:10.640> do<00:03:10.730> a<00:03:10.760> procedure<00:03:11.290> then<00:03:12.290> we<00:03:13.069> would

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.250 
resident do a procedure then we would

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:16.180 
resident do a procedure then we would
just<00:03:13.430> do<00:03:13.790> it<00:03:13.940> once<00:03:14.690> and<00:03:15.049> then<00:03:15.109> we<00:03:15.799> would<00:03:15.980> teach

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
just do it once and then we would teach

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:19.420 
just do it once and then we would teach
it<00:03:16.370> now<00:03:17.299> with<00:03:17.599> the<00:03:17.720> advent<00:03:17.810> of<00:03:18.109> simulation<00:03:18.829> the

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:19.430 
it now with the advent of simulation the

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.619 
it now with the advent of simulation the
adage<00:03:19.760> has<00:03:19.940> changed<00:03:20.510> to<00:03:20.810> see<00:03:21.680> one<00:03:21.920> do<00:03:22.700> mini<00:03:23.060> on

00:03:23.619 --> 00:03:23.629 
adage has changed to see one do mini on

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:26.680 
adage has changed to see one do mini on
a<00:03:23.660> simulator<00:03:24.430> then<00:03:25.430> do<00:03:25.670> one<00:03:25.879> on<00:03:26.030> a<00:03:26.060> patient<00:03:26.510> and

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:26.690 
a simulator then do one on a patient and

a simulator then do one on a patient and
