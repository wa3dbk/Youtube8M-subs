00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:07.390
 hello, how am I fucking and today 

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.849
 I bring a somewhat different video for 

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:12.700
 what is usual in the channel and 

00:00:09.849 --> 00:00:14.740
 that it is a contest or lottery of 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:17.140
 some keys for game sting 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:19.089
 pixel paire well for those who do not know it 

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:21.249
 it is an independent game that is now 

00:00:19.089 --> 00:00:22.989
 same in advance access in that 

00:00:21.249 --> 00:00:25.720
 platform in steam if I'm not wrong 

00:00:22.989 --> 00:00:27.579
 is in an alpha version the truth is 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:29.019
 that you can perfectly play him in 

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:31.419
 this version can at least be 

00:00:29.019 --> 00:00:33.460
 do things and that despite being a 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:34.990
 alpha version but logically remains 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.000
 a long way to go in his 

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:39.430
 development and the final version will have 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.410
 many more things is a game we could 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:44.340
 say that role with combats in time 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:47.980
 real some simulation components 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.240
 also some construction touch already 

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:52.000
 that we can build our own 

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:53.680
 boat and others and then apart too 

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.860
 has rock like elements since a 

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:58.180
 every game and every new new world 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:59.590
 that we start is generated in a way 

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:01.000
 random as well as what are we going 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:03.850
 finding our way and others 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.920
 It is also very difficult in some 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.909
 aspects at least and it can cost a 

00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.189
 little start playing 

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:11.049
 so it's really a challenge to do it 

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:13.119
 then this is a kind of 

00:01:11.049 --> 00:01:15.009
 promotion that we have made among several 

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:16.659
 youtubers that we talked to the 

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:18.789
 creator of the game one of them so 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:20.140
 unless it is Spanish and good I wanted 

00:01:18.789 --> 00:01:21.369
 promote the game and we have 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.159
 asked to see if he could give us 

00:01:21.369 --> 00:01:25.659
 some keys to draw between 

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:27.700
 our subscribers or those at 

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:29.709
 unless they were interested in 

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.899
 participate and the truth is that it has been 

00:01:29.709 --> 00:01:34.179
 really generous has given us enough 

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:36.459
 keys to each of the youtubers that 

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:39.579
 we have participated then I am going to 

00:01:36.459 --> 00:01:41.229
 overcome some of them by youtube 

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:44.200
 this video we will be able to participate in 

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:47.289
 him and maybe some on twitter if I see 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:49.270
 that there is some interest in there or what 

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:51.179
 be but in principle they are enough 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:53.819
 and several key opportunities 

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:56.170
 participate and of course to win 

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:57.879
 then I will put the description of the 

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.829
 video the channels of the other youtubers 

00:01:57.879 --> 00:02:01.599
 who have participated although in this case 

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:04.450
 I think I'm one of the last ones 

00:02:01.599 --> 00:02:06.579
 doing the raffle because I had not 

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.869
 given time to do it before so 

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:09.399
 even some of them have been finished 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:10.479
 but you can go through their 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:12.400
 channels 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:14.560
 if you are still doing it alone that you 

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.360
 there are more keys because they are also more 

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.640
 opportunities to win one of them 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:21.730
 so what do you have to do to 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.680
 participate in this contest or what are 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.629
 the conditions are quite 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.670
 simple the first of them would be to be 

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:29.830
 subscribed to the channel simply to this 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:32.319
 channel on the other hand should be given 

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:34.420
 lay the video itself and put a 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:36.190
 comment this is already a little more free 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.349
 the content of the comment 

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:39.819
 but good some ideas for example of 

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:42.430
 comments that you could put then 

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:44.709
 answering subjects we say 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:47.620
 related to piracy is that the 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:50.500
 piracy I mean this kind of 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:53.230
 pirates do not stop the other kind of 

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:56.349
 piracy but so for example that 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:58.660
 would you do if you were pirates or that you think 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:03:02.739
 that it would be the best thing to lead a life of 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:05.349
 obvious pirate I know that crew 

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:08.200
 I would try to get if you were pirates 

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:10.150
 or you can be a little more creative 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.010
 more free in that aspect and put 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.540
 Any type of related comment 

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:14.490
 with the game in that sense in the subject 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:16.170
 of 

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:18.000
 pirates also for example me who is 

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:20.390
 make a tune or anything 

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.860
 that you think of it, you put it and 

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:24.990
 reward especially or I will have more in 

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:26.850
 account maybe those comments more 

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:28.380
 creative or funny or that come out 

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:31.560
 of the ordinary course it is put 

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:33.180
 only I participate then logically what 

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.490
 I will take like a little less effort 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.870
 So those are the main criteria 

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:38.910
 then it will also be taken into account 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:41.430
 if for example I only have some for 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:44.910
 twitter then retweets to the video or 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:46.620
 also maybe in the ones that go through 

00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:48.780
 twitter it could equal a hashtag or 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:49.950
 I will see it as it is emerging and based on 

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:52.980
 participation but mainly 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:55.370
 would be that is subscribed to give like to 

00:03:52.980 --> 00:03:58.230
 video and leave a comment 

00:03:55.370 --> 00:04:00.510
 as creative as possible and related 

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:03.780
 with the pirates, that's what I know 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:05.640
 happen and what you want to put and in 

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:07.740
 base to that as I say I'll release enough 

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:11.310
 keys then the time limit would be 

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:13.390
 since today, Monday we are exactly 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:17.739
 to April 7 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:19.180
 Friday that would be April 11th that goes 

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:21.400
 to be a little bit of time for 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:24.190
 participate to do these three things 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:26.500
 in the video and enter the participation 

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:28.660
 and Friday will be when it starts 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:30.400
 distribute the keys I will logically 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:33.130
 by private youtube I will send to each 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:35.470
 one of those who have come out winners a 

00:04:33.130 --> 00:04:37.570
 key and you can activate the estimate and 

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:39.730
 you will have the game available and you can 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:41.410
 play it simply if you have not seen 

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:43.690
 practically almost nothing about the game and 

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:46.180
 you have everything to do, I'll go up very 

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:47.710
 possibly some gameplay of him these 

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:49.390
 days so do not worry I'll explain 

00:04:47.710 --> 00:04:51.430
 also how to play and that but 

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:52.960
 mainly that would be the system to 

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:55.810
 continue I think I do not forget anything 

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:57.430
 I think there will not be any more doubt about 

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:58.540
 anyway, if something happens to me 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:00.160
 put in the comments but 

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:02.140
 mainly to make it clear what 

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:04.840
 I'll comment again is a promotion 

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:06.610
 more youtubers participate in the 

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:08.140
 description I will put your channels in case 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:10.720
 you want to stop by and try your luck too 

00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:13.450
 there if they still have some keys 

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:16.090
 and that and to participate specifically in 

00:05:13.450 --> 00:05:17.260
 this video would be subscribed laical 

00:05:16.090 --> 00:05:19.750
 video 

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:22.930
 and put an original creative comment 

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:24.870
 funny what you want related to 

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:27.940
 the pirates think that little more 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:29.400
 just good luck to everyone and nothing 

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:31.810
 to be creative 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:34.060
 I think it's as fair as we can go 

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:36.310
 at the end it is one of the options that 

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:38.740
 you are all on equal terms 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:41.350
 and those who know will be rewarded 

00:05:38.740 --> 00:05:43.300
 differentiate yourself from the rest so I 've 

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:45.790
 said good luck and as I say the 

00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:47.820
 friday day 11 that then always many 

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:50.950
 questions about when it is 

00:05:47.820 --> 00:05:52.240
 decide who has been the winner or 

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:54.550
 winners will logically be 

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:56.920
 enough as I say there are numerous keys 

00:05:54.550 --> 00:06:00.130
 so the opportunities are quite 

00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:02.140
 and I will send a private to them as well 

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:03.580
 to be outstanding on Friday 

00:06:02.140 --> 00:06:06.580
 your private messages on youtube 

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:08.170
 to know if you have won and 

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:10.870
 as they always say in these 

00:06:08.170 --> 00:06:13.660
 cases in the end who is the winner 

00:06:10.870 --> 00:06:15.070
 the victory has to be humble and the 

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:17.620
 that have not been winners because the 

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:20.410
 next will be so good luck to 

00:06:17.620 --> 00:06:22.150
 all the participants and we'll see you in 

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:24.540
 the next video 

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:24.540
 goodbye
