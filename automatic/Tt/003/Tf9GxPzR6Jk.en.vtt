in<00:00:19.600> rope<00:00:19.720> supply<00:00:20.080> we<00:00:20.770> get<00:00:20.920> a<00:00:20.950> lot<00:00:21.160> of<00:00:21.279> questions

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:21.460 
in rope supply we get a lot of questions

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:23.519 
in rope supply we get a lot of questions
about<00:00:21.790> this<00:00:22.119> so<00:00:22.510> this<00:00:22.660> video<00:00:22.930> is<00:00:23.020> designed<00:00:23.170> to

some of the pros and cons of each rope

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:29.480 
some of the pros and cons of each rope
are<00:00:27.160> we'll<00:00:27.820> start<00:00:28.119> with<00:00:28.300> what<00:00:29.080> we<00:00:29.110> call<00:00:29.199> the

an exceptional product and basically

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:41.729 
an exceptional product and basically
this<00:00:39.910> rope<00:00:40.210> is<00:00:40.390> made<00:00:40.420> from<00:00:40.809> organic<00:00:40.989> fibers

00:00:41.729 --> 00:00:41.739 
this rope is made from organic fibers

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:43.829 
this rope is made from organic fibers
which<00:00:41.920> consists<00:00:42.460> surprisingly<00:00:43.120> mostly<00:00:43.750> of

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:43.839 
which consists surprisingly mostly of

00:00:43.839 --> 00:00:44.910 
which consists surprisingly mostly of
tree<00:00:44.080> bark

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:44.920 
tree bark

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.610 
tree bark
and<00:00:45.540> it<00:00:46.540> gets<00:00:46.750> twisted<00:00:47.110> into<00:00:47.290> this<00:00:47.409> three

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:47.620 
and it gets twisted into this three

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:49.770 
and it gets twisted into this three
strand<00:00:47.890> rope<00:00:48.129> here<00:00:48.370> and<00:00:48.519> it's<00:00:48.909> very<00:00:49.000> very<00:00:49.420> good

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:49.780 
strand rope here and it's very very good

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:51.990 
strand rope here and it's very very good
and<00:00:49.989> very<00:00:50.350> very<00:00:50.680> common<00:00:51.190> for<00:00:51.370> architectural

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:52.000 
and very very common for architectural

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.390 
and very very common for architectural
and<00:00:52.089> landscape<00:00:52.239> type<00:00:52.659> of<00:00:52.870> applications<00:00:53.559> it's

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:54.400 
and landscape type of applications it's

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.430 
and landscape type of applications it's
also<00:00:54.580> very<00:00:55.000> very<00:00:55.150> popular<00:00:55.600> for<00:00:55.839> exercise

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:56.440 
also very very popular for exercise

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.229 
also very very popular for exercise
climbing<00:00:57.040> so<00:00:57.370> if<00:00:57.489> you<00:00:57.580> need<00:00:57.729> an<00:00:57.850> exercise

00:01:00.119 --> 00:01:00.129 
climbing rope you need to look no

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:02.610 
climbing rope you need to look no
further<00:01:00.370> than<00:01:00.790> the<00:01:01.150> standard<00:01:01.809> organic<00:01:02.320> Manila

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:02.620 
further than the standard organic Manila

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.310 
further than the standard organic Manila
rope<00:01:02.680> here<00:01:03.239> it's<00:01:04.239> a<00:01:04.360> great<00:01:04.750> great<00:01:05.019> product

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:05.320 
rope here it's a great great product

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.410 
rope here it's a great great product
there<00:01:05.860> are<00:01:06.010> some<00:01:06.190> downsides<00:01:06.729> to<00:01:07.000> this<00:01:07.120> rope

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:07.420 
there are some downsides to this rope

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.180 
there are some downsides to this rope
however<00:01:07.900> and<00:01:08.140> I'd<00:01:08.260> like<00:01:08.560> to<00:01:08.680> outline<00:01:08.710> those

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:09.190 
however and I'd like to outline those

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:11.640 
however and I'd like to outline those
now<00:01:09.600> if<00:01:10.600> you're<00:01:10.869> going<00:01:10.960> to<00:01:11.049> use<00:01:11.200> this<00:01:11.380> in<00:01:11.530> an

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:11.650 
now if you're going to use this in an

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:13.920 
now if you're going to use this in an
architectural<00:01:12.250> landscape<00:01:12.520> application<00:01:13.479> for

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:13.930 
architectural landscape application for

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:15.510 
architectural landscape application for
instance<00:01:14.200> if<00:01:14.350> you<00:01:14.440> have<00:01:14.560> a<00:01:14.590> dock<00:01:14.920> or<00:01:15.160> a<00:01:15.220> patio

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.520 
instance if you have a dock or a patio

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:17.610 
instance if you have a dock or a patio
and<00:01:15.820> you<00:01:15.880> want<00:01:16.060> to<00:01:16.150> line<00:01:16.330> it<00:01:16.360> with<00:01:16.600> rope<00:01:16.900> then

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:17.620 
and you want to line it with rope then

00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:19.710 
and you want to line it with rope then
this<00:01:18.130> rope<00:01:18.460> will<00:01:18.670> shrink<00:01:19.000> when<00:01:19.180> it<00:01:19.300> gets<00:01:19.450> wet

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:19.720 
this rope will shrink when it gets wet

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:21.690 
this rope will shrink when it gets wet
it's<00:01:20.200> not<00:01:20.410> a<00:01:20.440> big<00:01:20.740> deal<00:01:20.950> once<00:01:21.280> it<00:01:21.430> dries<00:01:21.670> it

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:21.700 
it's not a big deal once it dries it

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.090 
it's not a big deal once it dries it
goes<00:01:22.030> back<00:01:22.300> to<00:01:22.480> about<00:01:22.660> 90%<00:01:23.050> of<00:01:23.440> its<00:01:23.620> original

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:24.100 
goes back to about 90% of its original

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:25.920 
goes back to about 90% of its original
length<00:01:24.310> but<00:01:24.820> it<00:01:24.940> is<00:01:25.120> an<00:01:25.270> issue<00:01:25.420> for<00:01:25.570> some

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:25.930 
length but it is an issue for some

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:28.530 
length but it is an issue for some
people<00:01:25.990> the<00:01:26.860> other<00:01:27.040> thing<00:01:27.340> is<00:01:27.580> that<00:01:27.610> this<00:01:28.210> rope

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:28.540 
people the other thing is that this rope

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:30.660 
people the other thing is that this rope
because<00:01:28.780> it<00:01:29.170> is<00:01:29.320> an<00:01:29.440> organic<00:01:29.740> natural<00:01:30.160> fibre

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:30.670 
because it is an organic natural fibre

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.120 
because it is an organic natural fibre
will<00:01:31.570> eventually<00:01:32.200> rot<00:01:32.440> given<00:01:32.860> enough<00:01:33.100> time

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.130 
will eventually rot given enough time

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.430 
will eventually rot given enough time
and<00:01:33.400> enough<00:01:33.790> moisture<00:01:34.210> now<00:01:34.990> it's<00:01:35.200> not<00:01:35.320> going

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:35.440 
and enough moisture now it's not going

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.500 
and enough moisture now it's not going
to<00:01:35.500> rot<00:01:35.710> over<00:01:36.100> the<00:01:36.190> weekend<00:01:36.640> but<00:01:37.000> depending<00:01:37.420> on

to rot over the weekend but depending on

to rot over the weekend but depending on
the<00:01:37.630> climate<00:01:37.840> that<00:01:38.050> you're<00:01:38.350> in<00:01:38.470> if<00:01:38.650> you<00:01:38.740> do<00:01:38.950> get

pattern just like you've seen the
natural-organic<00:02:28.060> Manila<00:02:28.720> rope<00:02:28.810> so<00:02:29.470> it<00:02:29.590> looks

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:29.829 
natural-organic Manila rope so it looks

00:02:29.829 --> 00:02:32.550 
natural-organic Manila rope so it looks
very<00:02:29.920> much<00:02:30.430> like<00:02:30.510> natural<00:02:31.510> Manila<00:02:31.840> but<00:02:32.379> it

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
very much like natural Manila but it

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:33.630 
very much like natural Manila but it
does<00:02:32.769> so<00:02:32.980> without<00:02:33.250> a<00:02:33.280> lot<00:02:33.489> of<00:02:33.519> the

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:33.640 
does so without a lot of the

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:35.910 
does so without a lot of the
deficiencies<00:02:34.390> of<00:02:34.689> the<00:02:34.900> organic<00:02:35.560> Manila<00:02:35.890> rope

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:35.920 
deficiencies of the organic Manila rope

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.699 
deficiencies of the organic Manila rope
does<00:02:36.340> this<00:02:37.060> rope<00:02:37.420> is<00:02:37.599> not<00:02:37.810> a<00:02:37.840> good<00:02:38.230> climbing

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:38.709 
does this rope is not a good climbing

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:40.470 
does this rope is not a good climbing
