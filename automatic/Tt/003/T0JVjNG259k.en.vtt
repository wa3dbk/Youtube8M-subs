00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:54.660 
eyebrows are such an important part of

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:56.270 
eyebrows are such an important part of
the<00:00:54.750> face<00:00:54.960> and<00:00:55.170> it<00:00:55.260> gives<00:00:55.410> so<00:00:55.590> much<00:00:55.710> balance<00:00:56.190> so

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
the face and it gives so much balance so

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.500 
the face and it gives so much balance so
you<00:00:56.340> really<00:00:56.640> want<00:00:56.820> to<00:00:56.910> be<00:00:57.000> sure<00:00:57.030> that<00:00:57.390> you're

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
you really want to be sure that you're

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:00.099 
you really want to be sure that you're
looking<00:00:58.050> at<00:00:58.800> both<00:00:59.070> sides<00:00:59.370> of<00:00:59.489> the<00:00:59.579> face<00:00:59.730> I

00:01:00.099 --> 00:01:00.109 
looking at both sides of the face I

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:04.219 
looking at both sides of the face I
really<00:01:01.109> like<00:01:01.890> this<00:01:02.370> sort<00:01:03.030> of<00:01:03.149> angular<00:01:03.660> side<00:01:03.930> I

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
really like this sort of angular side I

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.920 
really like this sort of angular side I
think<00:01:04.589> it<00:01:04.710> gives<00:01:04.830> her<00:01:05.159> a<00:01:05.339> lift<00:01:05.700> and<00:01:06.000> and<00:01:06.390> opens

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:06.930 
think it gives her a lift and and opens

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:09.679 
think it gives her a lift and and opens
up<00:01:07.080> her<00:01:07.320> eye<00:01:07.350> and<00:01:07.799> so<00:01:08.729> and<00:01:09.030> because<00:01:09.210> she's<00:01:09.479> got

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
up her eye and so and because she's got

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:10.940 
up her eye and so and because she's got
such<00:01:09.960> a<00:01:10.020> round<00:01:10.350> face

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
such a round face

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.789 
such a round face
I'm<00:01:11.010> not<00:01:11.280> going<00:01:11.520> to<00:01:12.049> duplicate<00:01:13.049> that<00:01:13.350> round

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
I'm not going to duplicate that round

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.670 
I'm not going to duplicate that round
look<00:01:14.250> with<00:01:14.640> the<00:01:15.049> eyebrow<00:01:16.049> I'm<00:01:16.380> going<00:01:16.530> to<00:01:16.590> give

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
look with the eyebrow I'm going to give

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:17.990 
look with the eyebrow I'm going to give
her<00:01:16.770> a<00:01:16.830> little<00:01:16.950> bit<00:01:17.070> more<00:01:17.280> of<00:01:17.369> an<00:01:17.490> angle<00:01:17.850> with

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
her a little bit more of an angle with

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.120 
her a little bit more of an angle with
it<00:01:18.180> just<00:01:18.600> to<00:01:18.720> help<00:01:18.960> soften<00:01:19.290> some<00:01:19.950> of<00:01:20.009> the

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
it just to help soften some of the

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.580 
it just to help soften some of the
rounder<00:01:20.490> edges<00:01:20.670> or<00:01:21.000> rounder<00:01:21.869> shapes<00:01:22.170> on<00:01:22.409> her

rounder edges or rounder shapes on her
face<00:01:22.830> that's<00:01:23.580> my<00:01:23.850> thinking<00:01:24.150> on<00:01:24.360> this<00:01:24.420> another

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:25.170 
face that's my thinking on this another

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.679 
face that's my thinking on this another
thing<00:01:25.409> is<00:01:25.590> is<00:01:25.770> Leah's<00:01:26.640> got<00:01:26.790> a<00:01:26.850> fantastic<00:01:27.060> brow

00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
thing is is Leah's got a fantastic brow

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.330 
thing is is Leah's got a fantastic brow
but<00:01:27.900> say<00:01:28.140> your<00:01:28.320> brows<00:01:28.530> start<00:01:28.860> a<00:01:28.950> little<00:01:29.100> bit

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
but say your brows start a little bit

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.569 
but say your brows start a little bit
further<00:01:29.640> back<00:01:29.880> you<00:01:30.479> want<00:01:30.720> to<00:01:30.810> use<00:01:31.110> a<00:01:31.579> pencil

00:01:32.569 --> 00:01:32.579 
further back you want to use a pencil

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:36.260 
further back you want to use a pencil
and<00:01:33.030> the<00:01:33.960> gauge<00:01:34.200> is<00:01:34.560> if<00:01:35.220> you<00:01:35.729> look<00:01:35.970> at<00:01:36.090> that

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
and the gauge is if you look at that

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.420 
and the gauge is if you look at that
nostril<00:01:36.840> and<00:01:37.049> going<00:01:37.500> all<00:01:37.650> the<00:01:37.680> way<00:01:37.829> up<00:01:37.920> do<00:01:38.369> you

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430 
nostril and going all the way up do you

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:41.090 
nostril and going all the way up do you
see<00:01:38.549> how<00:01:38.670> perfectly<00:01:38.909> her<00:01:39.479> brow<00:01:40.380> lines<00:01:40.740> up

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:41.100 
see how perfectly her brow lines up

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.010 
see how perfectly her brow lines up
that's<00:01:41.700> where<00:01:41.909> you<00:01:41.970> want<00:01:42.150> to<00:01:42.240> start<00:01:42.570> the<00:01:42.750> brow

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:43.020 
that's where you want to start the brow

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.139 
that's where you want to start the brow
so<00:01:43.560> then<00:01:43.799> you<00:01:44.040> want<00:01:44.250> to<00:01:44.340> angle<00:01:44.490> for<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:44.970> outer

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
so then you want to angle for the outer

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.810 
so then you want to angle for the outer
line<00:01:45.570> you<00:01:46.320> want<00:01:46.470> to<00:01:46.560> use<00:01:46.680> that<00:01:46.860> pencil<00:01:47.369> to<00:01:47.610> give

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820

angling the pencil again and you're

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:29.750 
angling the pencil again and you're
seeing<00:03:28.260> that<00:03:28.440> it<00:03:28.560> catches<00:03:28.769> just<00:03:29.040> right<00:03:29.430> under

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:29.760 
seeing that it catches just right under

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.110

where<00:03:30.120> her<00:03:30.299> eye<00:03:30.329> is<00:03:30.540> so<00:03:31.440> her<00:03:31.560> eyebrow<00:03:32.120> should

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:33.120 
where her eye is so her eyebrow should

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:37.580 
where her eye is so her eyebrow should
extend<00:03:33.540> just<00:03:33.840> a<00:03:34.700> bit<00:03:35.700> out<00:03:35.940> and<00:03:36.510> you<00:03:37.230> can<00:03:37.410> really

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
extend just a bit out and you can really

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:40.309 
extend just a bit out and you can really
see<00:03:38.040> the<00:03:38.609> change<00:03:39.000> the<00:03:39.510> difference<00:03:39.989> by

00:03:40.309 --> 00:03:40.319 
see the change the difference by

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:42.199 
see the change the difference by
extending<00:03:40.889> the<00:03:40.980> brow<00:03:41.190> and<00:03:41.489> filling<00:03:41.910> them<00:03:42.060> in

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:42.209 
extending the brow and filling them in

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:44.840 
extending the brow and filling them in
I've<00:03:42.720> also<00:03:42.959> made<00:03:43.380> the<00:03:43.500> shape<00:03:43.799> a<00:03:44.100> little<00:03:44.670> bit

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
I've also made the shape a little bit
