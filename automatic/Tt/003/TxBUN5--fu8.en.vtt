this<00:01:31.530> big<00:01:31.770> like<00:01:32.100> floaty<00:01:32.430> balloon<00:01:32.970> and<00:01:33.270> Mario's

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.170 
this big like floaty balloon and Mario's

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.780 
this big like floaty balloon and Mario's
like<00:01:34.350> gripping<00:01:34.740> him<00:01:34.890> on<00:01:35.070> all<00:01:35.220> sides<00:01:35.490> and<00:01:35.729> they

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:35.790 
like gripping him on all sides and they

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:37.969 
like gripping him on all sides and they
float<00:01:36.030> up<00:01:36.180> into<00:01:36.270> the<00:01:36.420> sky<00:01:36.630> together<00:01:36.829> and<00:01:37.829> then

00:01:37.969 --> 00:01:37.979 
float up into the sky together and then

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.380 
float up into the sky together and then
my<00:01:38.310> personal<00:01:38.729> favorite<00:01:39.030> of<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.210> Yoshi

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:39.390 
my personal favorite of the Yoshi

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:42.050 
my personal favorite of the Yoshi
transformations<00:01:40.170> is<00:01:40.350> the<00:01:40.470> dash<00:01:40.680> pepper<00:01:41.060> where

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
transformations is the dash pepper where

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.929 
transformations is the dash pepper where
basically<00:01:42.479> you<00:01:42.600> yo<00:01:43.259> she<00:01:43.320> eats<00:01:44.009> this<00:01:44.310> this<00:01:44.759> red

00:01:44.929 --> 00:01:44.939 
basically you yo she eats this this red

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:47.780 
basically you yo she eats this this red
hot<00:01:45.090> pepper<00:01:45.329> and<00:01:45.860> starts<00:01:46.860> running<00:01:47.040> really

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:47.790 
hot pepper and starts running really

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.880 
hot pepper and starts running really
about<00:01:48.060> one<00:01:48.270> inch<00:01:48.420> out<00:01:48.570> of<00:01:48.600> control<00:01:49.020> super<00:01:49.649> fast

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
about one inch out of control super fast

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.300 
about one inch out of control super fast
you<00:01:50.250> can<00:01:50.460> you<00:01:50.970> can<00:01:51.119> run<00:01:51.299> up<00:01:51.540> vertical<00:01:51.990> faces

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:52.310 
you can you can run up vertical faces

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.830 
you can you can run up vertical faces
and<00:01:53.310> you<00:01:53.460> can<00:01:53.640> kind<00:01:53.820> of<00:01:53.939> navigate<00:01:54.450> your<00:01:54.780> way

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
and you can kind of navigate your way

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.200 
and you can kind of navigate your way
along<00:01:55.290> these<00:01:55.470> vertical<00:01:55.860> planes<00:01:56.100> using<00:01:56.850> Yoshi

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.210 
along these vertical planes using Yoshi

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.630 
along these vertical planes using Yoshi
running<00:01:57.600> at<00:01:57.689> super<00:01:57.930> high<00:01:57.960> speed<00:01:58.380> and<00:01:58.619> it's<00:01:59.399> a

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
running at super high speed and it's a

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:01.069 
running at super high speed and it's a
it's<00:01:59.850> very<00:02:00.060> challenging<00:02:00.270> but<00:02:00.750> at<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:00.899> same

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:01.079 
it's very challenging but at the same

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:03.080 
it's very challenging but at the same
time<00:02:01.259> it's<00:02:01.799> a<00:02:01.860> lot<00:02:01.979> of<00:02:02.009> fun<00:02:02.100> yeah<00:02:02.850> you<00:02:02.939> guys<00:02:03.060> are

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:03.090 
time it's a lot of fun yeah you guys are

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:04.550 
time it's a lot of fun yeah you guys are
showing<00:02:03.450> off<00:02:03.570> a<00:02:03.600> bunch<00:02:03.869> of<00:02:03.990> different<00:02:04.259> levels

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
showing off a bunch of different levels

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:05.870 
showing off a bunch of different levels
and<00:02:04.740> could<00:02:04.890> you<00:02:04.950> describe<00:02:05.219> some<00:02:05.520> of<00:02:05.549> them<00:02:05.729> like

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:05.880 
and could you describe some of them like

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:08.240 
and could you describe some of them like
some<00:02:06.030> of<00:02:06.090> the<00:02:06.149> highlight<00:02:06.860> well<00:02:07.860> probably

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
some of the highlight well probably

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.710 
some of the highlight well probably
another<00:02:08.550> one<00:02:08.700> of<00:02:08.789> my<00:02:08.849> favorites<00:02:09.209> is<00:02:09.330> actually

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:09.720 
another one of my favorites is actually

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.540 
another one of my favorites is actually
the<00:02:10.140> very<00:02:10.259> first<00:02:10.379> level<00:02:10.770> in<00:02:10.979> the<00:02:11.009> media<00:02:11.340> summit

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
the very first level in the media summit

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.220 
the very first level in the media summit
build<00:02:11.819> which<00:02:12.420> the<00:02:13.020> /

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.230 
build which the /

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:14.540 
build which the /
this<00:02:13.319> really<00:02:13.590> is<00:02:13.739> to<00:02:13.890> just<00:02:14.069> serve<00:02:14.250> as<00:02:14.430> an

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:14.550 
this really is to just serve as an

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:15.920 
this really is to just serve as an
introduction<00:02:14.819> to<00:02:15.030> the<00:02:15.239> basic<00:02:15.569> mario

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:15.930 
introduction to the basic mario

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.470 
introduction to the basic mario
mechanics<00:02:16.470> in<00:02:16.620> mario<00:02:16.860> galaxy<00:02:17.209> but<00:02:18.209> one<00:02:18.330> of<00:02:18.360> the

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:18.480 
mechanics in mario galaxy but one of the

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:19.699 
mechanics in mario galaxy but one of the
things<00:02:18.510> I've<00:02:18.810> always<00:02:18.959> loved<00:02:19.230> about<00:02:19.290> the<00:02:19.530> game

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
things I've always loved about the game

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:21.649 
things I've always loved about the game
is<00:02:19.950> the<00:02:20.099> ability<00:02:20.310> to<00:02:20.730> kind<00:02:21.000> of<00:02:21.120> do<00:02:21.299> the<00:02:21.450> long

00:02:21.649 --> 00:02:21.659 
is the ability to kind of do the long

00:02:21.659 --> 00:02:23.839 
is the ability to kind of do the long
jumps<00:02:22.080> over<00:02:22.260> the<00:02:22.319> smaller<00:02:22.590> planets<00:02:23.099> and

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:23.849 
jumps over the smaller planets and

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:25.309 
jumps over the smaller planets and
there's<00:02:24.030> a<00:02:24.090> particular<00:02:24.360> point<00:02:24.750> in<00:02:24.959> that<00:02:25.140> level

00:02:25.309 --> 00:02:25.319 
there's a particular point in that level

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:27.110 
there's a particular point in that level
where<00:02:25.650> there's<00:02:25.830> about<00:02:26.610> three<00:02:26.970> different

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:27.120 
where there's about three different

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.149 
where there's about three different
small<00:02:27.720> orbs<00:02:28.290> positioned<00:02:28.739> all<00:02:28.860> near<00:02:29.040> each

00:02:29.149 --> 00:02:29.159 
small orbs positioned all near each

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:31.339 
small orbs positioned all near each
other<00:02:29.280> and<00:02:29.580> you<00:02:30.000> can<00:02:30.150> actually<00:02:30.299> one<00:02:31.170> of<00:02:31.200> them

00:02:31.339 --> 00:02:31.349 
other and you can actually one of them

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:33.380 
other and you can actually one of them
if<00:02:31.530> you<00:02:31.620> do<00:02:31.769> they<00:02:31.950> jump<00:02:32.519> the<00:02:32.610> right<00:02:32.760> way<00:02:32.879> you

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:33.390 
if you do they jump the right way you

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:34.820 
if you do they jump the right way you
can<00:02:33.540> get<00:02:33.629> into<00:02:33.780> complete<00:02:34.170> orbit<00:02:34.530> and<00:02:34.680> just

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:34.830 
can get into complete orbit and just

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.500 
can get into complete orbit and just
keep<00:02:34.980> circling<00:02:35.370> around<00:02:35.670> and<00:02:36.150> around<00:02:36.239> and

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
keep circling around and around and

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.690 
keep circling around and around and
around<00:02:36.599> and<00:02:36.989> the<00:02:37.980> first<00:02:38.190> time<00:02:38.340> I<00:02:38.400> played<00:02:38.459> the

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
around and the first time I played the

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:40.039 
around and the first time I played the
original<00:02:38.790> it<00:02:39.180> was<00:02:39.360> that<00:02:39.629> was<00:02:39.750> one<00:02:39.900> of<00:02:39.989> the

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:40.049 
original it was that was one of the

00:02:40.049 --> 00:02:41.150 
original it was that was one of the
things<00:02:40.200> that<00:02:40.349> I<00:02:40.500> would<00:02:40.620> just<00:02:40.769> sit<00:02:40.920> there<00:02:41.040> and

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:41.160 
things that I would just sit there and

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.890 
things that I would just sit there and
do<00:02:41.310> over<00:02:41.610> and<00:02:41.700> over<00:02:41.819> again<00:02:42.030> and<00:02:42.329> one<00:02:42.659> of<00:02:42.780> those

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900 
do over and over again and one of those

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.199 
do over and over again and one of those
uniquely<00:02:43.379> like<00:02:43.590> magical<00:02:44.159> moments<00:02:44.610> beyond

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:45.209 
uniquely like magical moments beyond

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:46.520 
uniquely like magical moments beyond
that<00:02:45.329> I<00:02:45.450> mean<00:02:45.720> obviously<00:02:46.049> they're<00:02:46.230> having<00:02:46.470> a

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
that I mean obviously they're having a

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.170 
that I mean obviously they're having a
lot<00:02:46.709> of<00:02:46.739> fun<00:02:46.950> with<00:02:47.099> with<00:02:47.400> gravity<00:02:47.819> again<00:02:48.000> this

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
lot of fun with with gravity again this

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.319 
lot of fun with with gravity again this
time<00:02:48.360> around<00:02:49.129> another<00:02:50.129> one<00:02:50.280> is<00:02:50.310> the<00:02:50.879> upside

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:51.329 
time around another one is the upside

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:53.900 
time around another one is the upside
dizzy<00:02:51.629> galaxy<00:02:52.079> where<00:02:52.620> there<00:02:52.769> are<00:02:52.980> basically

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
dizzy galaxy where there are basically

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.479 
dizzy galaxy where there are basically
moving<00:02:54.299> gravity<00:02:55.109> fields<00:02:55.620> pulling<00:02:56.400> in

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
moving gravity fields pulling in

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:58.670 
moving gravity fields pulling in
opposite<00:02:56.819> directions<00:02:56.940> and<00:02:57.599> you<00:02:58.319> not<00:02:58.500> only

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
opposite directions and you not only

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.289 
opposite directions and you not only
have<00:02:58.920> to<00:02:58.950> navigate<00:02:59.250> then<00:02:59.760> moving<00:03:00.030> that

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:00.299 
have to navigate then moving that

00:03:00.299 --> 00:03:02.030 
have to navigate then moving that
gravity<00:03:00.780> fields<00:03:01.230> but<00:03:01.410> you've<00:03:01.590> also<00:03:01.739> got<00:03:02.010> to

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:02.040 
gravity fields but you've also got to

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.580 
gravity fields but you've also got to
figure<00:03:02.280> out<00:03:02.489> okay<00:03:02.879> how<00:03:03.090> do<00:03:03.540> I<00:03:03.660> get<00:03:03.750> from<00:03:04.140> here
