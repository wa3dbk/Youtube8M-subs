mono development and let's start off

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:15.680 
mono development and let's start off
with<00:00:14.309> the<00:00:14.580> summary<00:00:15.000> at<00:00:15.120> the<00:00:15.179> top<00:00:15.240> for<00:00:15.630> the

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:21.710 
class alright so the name of the class

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:27.080 
class alright so the name of the class
vital<00:00:22.710> dot<00:00:23.580> CS<00:00:24.890> the<00:00:25.890> date<00:00:26.490> would<00:00:26.730> be<00:00:26.760> September

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
vital dot CS the date would be September

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:33.509 
vital dot CS the date would be September
10th

00:00:33.509 --> 00:00:33.519 

00:00:33.519 --> 00:00:39.880 

and<00:00:34.519> my<00:00:34.940> name

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:39.890 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.060 

and<00:00:40.460> then<00:00:40.640> a<00:00:40.670> brief<00:00:40.940> description<00:00:41.360> of<00:00:41.830> what<00:00:42.830> the

00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:43.070 
and then a brief description of what the

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:53.710 
and then a brief description of what the
class<00:00:43.250> does<00:00:44.710> so<00:00:45.710> the<00:00:46.070> vitals<00:00:46.400> class

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:53.720 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:01:03.580 

this<00:00:54.290> class<00:00:54.590> contains

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:03.590 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:13.920 

all<00:01:03.740> the<00:01:04.519> extra<00:01:07.960> functions<00:01:08.960> for<00:01:09.500> a

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:13.930 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:18.560 

character's<00:01:14.930> vitals

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.210 

okay<00:01:19.530> so<00:01:19.680> current<00:01:20.310> value<00:01:21.830> this<00:01:22.830> is<00:01:22.950> just<00:01:23.100> a

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
okay so current value this is just a

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:29.650 
okay so current value this is just a
private<00:01:23.460> integer<00:01:25.820> this<00:01:26.820> is<00:01:27.120> the<00:01:28.490> current

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:29.660 
private integer this is the current

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:34.000 
private integer this is the current
value<00:01:30.660> of<00:01:31.520> this<00:01:32.520> file

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:34.010 
value of this file

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:36.680 
value of this file
so<00:01:35.010> for<00:01:35.190> instance<00:01:35.310> if<00:01:35.580> I<00:01:35.670> characterize<00:01:36.060> let's

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:36.690 
so for instance if I characterize let's

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:38.870 
so for instance if I characterize let's
say<00:01:36.810> a<00:01:36.840> hundred<00:01:37.050> health<00:01:37.410> and<00:01:38.220> he<00:01:38.280> takes<00:01:38.520> a<00:01:38.640> few

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:38.880 
say a hundred health and he takes a few

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.030 
say a hundred health and he takes a few
whacks<00:01:39.090> and<00:01:39.540> he's<00:01:39.750> you<00:01:40.350> know<00:01:40.470> down<00:01:40.710> to<00:01:40.860> eighty

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
whacks and he's you know down to eighty

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.190 
whacks and he's you know down to eighty
health<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:42.060> current<00:01:42.420> value<00:01:42.720> will<00:01:42.900> actually

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
health the current value will actually

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:48.490 
health the current value will actually
be<00:01:43.290> the<00:01:43.380> eighty<00:01:43.500> health<00:01:44.390> so<00:01:45.390> our<00:01:45.510> constructor

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.500 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.170 

and<00:01:49.500> I'm<00:01:49.650> going<00:01:49.800> to<00:01:49.830> add<00:01:49.950> my<00:01:50.100> debug<00:01:50.490> log

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
and I'm going to add my debug log

00:01:51.180 --> 00:02:00.150 
and I'm going to add my debug log
statement<00:01:51.750> here

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:00.160 

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:10.630 

and<00:02:01.160> I'm<00:02:01.400> just<00:02:01.550> gonna<00:02:01.670> say<00:02:02.860> vital<00:02:03.860> created

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:14.990 

now<00:02:11.600> the<00:02:11.660> current<00:02:12.110> value

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:15.000 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.170 

it<00:02:15.570> returns<00:02:15.960> an<00:02:16.170> int<00:02:16.380> and<00:02:16.800> it<00:02:17.670> has<00:02:17.790> a<00:02:17.820> getter

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.180 
it returns an int and it has a getter

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:24.860 
it returns an int and it has a getter
and<00:02:18.270> a<00:02:18.570> setter<00:02:18.600> so<00:02:20.030> we're<00:02:21.030> gonna<00:02:21.120> say<00:02:23.870> when

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
and a setter so we're gonna say when

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:35.890 
and a setter so we're gonna say when
getting<00:02:25.320> the<00:02:30.920> curv<00:02:31.920> al

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:43.059 

value<00:02:37.840> make<00:02:38.840> sure<00:02:39.230> that<00:02:39.769> it<00:02:40.189> is<00:02:40.519> not<00:02:42.069> greater

00:02:43.059 --> 00:02:43.069 
value make sure that it is not greater

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:58.540 
value make sure that it is not greater
than<00:02:44.500> our<00:02:46.269> and<00:02:48.519> adjusted<00:02:49.519> base<00:02:51.099> value

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:58.550 

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:05.430 

if<00:02:59.210> it<00:02:59.450> is<00:03:00.550> make<00:03:01.550> it<00:03:01.820> the<00:03:02.150> same<00:03:03.140> as<00:03:03.580> our

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:05.440 
if it is make it the same as our

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:10.990 
if it is make it the same as our
adjusted<00:03:06.440> base<00:03:07.250> value<00:03:09.730> so<00:03:10.730> what<00:03:10.820> we're<00:03:10.970> doing

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:11.000 
adjusted base value so what we're doing

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.940 
adjusted base value so what we're doing
here<00:03:11.390> when<00:03:11.630> we're<00:03:11.750> getting<00:03:11.900> the<00:03:12.140> method<00:03:12.500> is

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
here when we're getting the method is

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:14.410 
here when we're getting the method is
we're<00:03:13.160> actually<00:03:13.280> going<00:03:13.520> to<00:03:13.580> check<00:03:13.850> the<00:03:14.090> value

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420 
we're actually going to check the value

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.120 
we're actually going to check the value
that<00:03:14.570> we<00:03:14.690> have<00:03:14.720> stored<00:03:15.200> in<00:03:15.380> our<00:03:15.440> current<00:03:15.800> value

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130 
that we have stored in our current value

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:17.740 
that we have stored in our current value
and<00:03:16.790> we're<00:03:17.000> going<00:03:17.120> to<00:03:17.150> compare<00:03:17.300> it<00:03:17.510> against

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
and we're going to compare it against

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.770 
and we're going to compare it against
this<00:03:17.930> adjusted<00:03:18.530> base<00:03:18.710> value<00:03:19.220> and<00:03:19.540> if<00:03:20.540> it<00:03:20.690> is

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:20.780 
this adjusted base value and if it is

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:22.540 
this adjusted base value and if it is
greater<00:03:21.080> than<00:03:21.200> the<00:03:21.410> adjusted<00:03:21.890> base<00:03:22.100> value

00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:22.550 
greater than the adjusted base value

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:23.710 
greater than the adjusted base value
then<00:03:22.700> we're<00:03:22.820> going<00:03:22.940> to<00:03:23.000> set<00:03:23.240> the<00:03:23.360> current

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:23.720 
then we're going to set the current

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:25.890 
then we're going to set the current
value<00:03:24.020> to<00:03:24.230> equal<00:03:24.680> the<00:03:24.800> adjusted<00:03:25.220> base<00:03:25.400> value

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:25.900 
value to equal the adjusted base value

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.750 
value to equal the adjusted base value
so<00:03:26.900> again<00:03:27.290> if<00:03:27.440> your<00:03:27.740> character<00:03:28.250> has<00:03:28.370> a<00:03:28.400> hundred

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:28.760 
so again if your character has a hundred

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.940 
so again if your character has a hundred
health<00:03:28.970> then<00:03:29.930> you<00:03:30.320> know<00:03:30.380> he<00:03:30.500> takes<00:03:30.680> a<00:03:30.800> few

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:30.950 
health then you know he takes a few

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:33.430 
health then you know he takes a few
whacks<00:03:31.130> goes<00:03:31.520> down<00:03:31.730> to<00:03:31.910> 80<00:03:32.090> and<00:03:32.570> let's<00:03:33.140> say<00:03:33.290> he

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:33.440 
whacks goes down to 80 and let's say he

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.380 
whacks goes down to 80 and let's say he
uses<00:03:33.800> some<00:03:34.010> healing<00:03:34.310> potion<00:03:34.820> that<00:03:34.940> gives<00:03:35.240> him

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:35.390 
uses some healing potion that gives him

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:38.920 
uses some healing potion that gives him
25<00:03:35.900> back<00:03:36.370> well<00:03:37.370> that<00:03:37.400> would<00:03:37.850> make<00:03:38.300> him<00:03:38.480> up<00:03:38.630> his

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:38.930 
25 back well that would make him up his

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:40.690 
25 back well that would make him up his
current<00:03:39.200> value<00:03:39.590> go<00:03:39.770> up<00:03:39.800> to<00:03:40.100> a<00:03:40.130> hundred<00:03:40.520> and

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:40.700 
current value go up to a hundred and

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.120 
current value go up to a hundred and
five<00:03:40.880> we<00:03:41.240> don't<00:03:41.450> want<00:03:41.660> that<00:03:41.900> so<00:03:42.290> we'll<00:03:42.800> have<00:03:42.980> it

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.130 
five we don't want that so we'll have it

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:44.830 
five we don't want that so we'll have it
automatically<00:03:43.700> check<00:03:44.060> and<00:03:44.300> if<00:03:44.360> the<00:03:44.540> current

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:44.840 
automatically check and if the current

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.240 
automatically check and if the current
value<00:03:44.870> is<00:03:45.170> greater<00:03:45.590> than<00:03:45.740> your<00:03:45.890> adjusted

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.250 
value is greater than your adjusted

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:48.730 
value is greater than your adjusted
value<00:03:46.610> then<00:03:47.420> your<00:03:48.020> current<00:03:48.200> value<00:03:48.500> is<00:03:48.560> going

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:48.740 
value then your current value is going

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:51.790 
value then your current value is going
to<00:03:48.830> equal<00:03:48.950> that<00:03:49.220> adjusted<00:03:49.640> value<00:03:50.710> then<00:03:51.710> of

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:51.800 
to equal that adjusted value then of

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:53.380 
to equal that adjusted value then of
course<00:03:52.010> after<00:03:52.550> we've<00:03:52.670> done<00:03:52.790> that<00:03:52.970> we<00:03:53.240> just

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:53.390 
course after we've done that we just

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:56.530 
course after we've done that we just
return<00:03:53.840> the<00:03:53.960> current<00:03:54.140> value<00:03:54.530> and<00:03:55.270> the<00:03:56.270> setter

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:56.540 
return the current value and the setter

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:58.510 
return the current value and the setter
is<00:03:56.810> just<00:03:57.470> like<00:03:57.620> all<00:03:57.800> the<00:03:57.920> other<00:03:58.040> setters<00:03:58.370> we've

00:03:58.510 --> 00:03:58.520 
is just like all the other setters we've

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:00.940 
is just like all the other setters we've
done<00:03:58.700> so<00:03:58.910> far<00:03:58.940> we'll<00:03:59.390> just<00:03:59.540> take<00:03:59.780> the<00:04:00.530> variable

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:00.950 
done so far we'll just take the variable

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:02.650 
done so far we'll just take the variable
we<00:04:01.070> want<00:04:01.250> to<00:04:01.370> assign<00:04:01.580> a<00:04:01.640> value<00:04:01.880> to<00:04:02.300> and<00:04:02.540> we're

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:02.660 
we want to assign a value to and we're

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:03.820 
we want to assign a value to and we're
going<00:04:02.690> to<00:04:02.840> assign<00:04:03.110> it<00:04:03.290> the<00:04:03.320> value<00:04:03.440> that's

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:03.830 
going to assign it the value that's

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:11.890 
going to assign it the value that's
passed<00:04:04.010> into<00:04:04.550> here<00:04:09.250> okay<00:04:10.250> so<00:04:10.570> let's<00:04:11.570> go<00:04:11.720> down

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:11.900 
passed into here okay so let's go down

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:20.289 
passed into here okay so let's go down
here<00:04:12.130> final<00:04:13.130> name<00:04:15.130> this<00:04:16.720> enumeration<00:04:18.640> is<00:04:19.640> just

00:04:20.289 --> 00:04:20.299

here final name this enumeration is just
a<00:04:20.720> list<00:04:21.560> of<00:04:21.799> the<00:04:22.700> vitals<00:04:25.600> our<00:04:26.860> character<00:04:27.860> will

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.340 
a list of the vitals our character will

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:33.460 
a list of the vitals our character will
