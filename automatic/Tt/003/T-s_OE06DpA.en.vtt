00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.200
 Hello and welcome to a new tutorial by Mister 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.089
 Young 

00:00:08.089 --> 00:00:13.629
 Basics of photography that is a wish Dr Mayer and met one of the 

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:19.850
 Videos brought as comment Borna was the author of these lines wanted 

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:25.630
 like to not go into the basics of photography any more 

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:29.560
 so of course I want to fulfill my audience wishes I want that 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.720
 now in a relaxed sequence do that means there is always a video again 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.560
 where is supposed to be the basics of photography 

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:42.050
 We start today with the theme endorsed 

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:44.120
 exposure 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:49.030
 is always the 2 2 at the game of two elements would namely percent of 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:52.190
 Closure and the turn 

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:53.320
 before the end 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.540
 controls the test time 

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:58.970
 in the cup light on the film or the sensor falling 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.770
 and van der Sar shutter equal exposure time 

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:04.830
 and aperture 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.600
 controls the amount of light 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:07.790
 the inside 

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.270
 The time given by the shutter 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:14.140
 the sensor or the film is missing 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:15.720
 sounds complicated 

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:16.870
 but is 

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:19.380
 not so difficult 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.110
 the setting of the aperture I find on a scale on the 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:24.310
 lens 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:30.360
 the scale begins in the Bible at two com 803 comer 5 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.990
 and goes to 32 about that 

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.270
 depending on objectively move 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.970
 around because most objective form only the middle range Dr possible 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:43.250
 Values 

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:49.130
 the possible values â€‹â€‹are the blender 1 1 comeback 4 2 comma 8 3 com on 

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.980
 and 

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:52.540
 4 5 won 6 8 11 

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.630
 16 32 5 40 and 64 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.319
 So show a few numbers thrown at the head 

00:01:59.319 --> 00:02:02.819
 do not worry he does not have to remember that's why there is so fast 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.250
 but it is important 

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:11.100
 but who can usually find the bezels on the lens but at least lens 

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.239
 SLR cameras that's it 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:18.419
 otherwise i can get these blind mostly in any crap at the 

00:02:18.419 --> 00:02:20.559
 Set the camera 

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:23.070
 so then I take pictures with you now 

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:26.070
 For example, the dazzles two comeback 8 

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:30.199
 then I read a certain amount of light through the lens 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:33.670
 with the panel 3com on 5 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.529
 what the next value on CTIA at the moment would be all over Ghana 

00:02:37.529 --> 00:02:39.799
 Do not leave just half the light 

00:02:39.799 --> 00:02:41.929
 on the movies 

00:02:41.929 --> 00:02:47.929
 Met the Aperture 4 what follows the blind 3com on five I leave only the 

00:02:47.929 --> 00:02:52.249
 Half of the poem of 3 Komar 5 on the movie 

00:02:53.079 --> 00:02:54.959
 the tool is 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:58.689
 a bit difficult to grasp but internalized once again 

00:02:58.689 --> 00:03:00.149
 then the thing works 

00:03:00.149 --> 00:03:01.279
 so 

00:03:01.279 --> 00:03:03.009
 maneuverable 

00:03:03.009 --> 00:03:05.969
 turn one more value 

00:03:05.969 --> 00:03:09.199
 the Blender so no value Kienle Arena 

00:03:10.229 --> 00:03:15.259
 including only half enjoyment for us 

00:03:15.259 --> 00:03:18.229
 inherited from its predecessor 

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:21.229
 be on my movie or mine 

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:23.879
 do not despair 

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:25.330
 look at the whole thing 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:28.619
 a little closer 

00:03:28.619 --> 00:03:31.619
 so I have provided her husband an objective 

00:03:32.509 --> 00:03:33.569
 because it works 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:35.519
 So here we have that 

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:37.059
 are with the pressure around 

00:03:37.059 --> 00:03:39.389
 to bind the rain with the 

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:40.550
 two come 

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:44.679
 four five good 6 8 11 16 22 

00:03:44.679 --> 00:03:46.209
 seen through 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:48.389
 down here at the rings 

00:03:48.389 --> 00:03:51.389
 Can I introduce the corresponding plans 

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:55.469
 because the objective at least so 

00:03:55.469 --> 00:03:58.679
 and is told when I introduce the blind work 

00:03:58.679 --> 00:04:00.510
 it also decreases 

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:02.529
 Passage at opening 

00:04:02.529 --> 00:04:05.529
 of the light for the objective 

00:04:06.099 --> 00:04:08.639
 the hit list greatest value 

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:12.079
 now puts clothes 

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:13.439
 after the end of the project 

00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:16.889
 and you see 

00:04:16.889 --> 00:04:19.509
 here clearly 

00:04:19.509 --> 00:04:22.509
 less light 

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:29.650
 Card seen what happens when I value the joints on the lens 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:31.210
 change 

00:04:31.210 --> 00:04:35.139
 and the pension value is not the only value that is significant for the exposure 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:39.389
 but the second work that I said at the beginning is the 

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:42.389
 Shutter or shutter speed 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:49.150
 Extension of the shutter speed from, for example, 105 20 cents to 1 60 percent 

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:53.590
 does not mean that twice as much light on the sensor 

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:55.430
 is clear 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:58.229
 105th of a second not 

00:04:58.229 --> 00:04:59.800
 or a 

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:01.400
 do you see yourself 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:05.540
 means twice as much light on the sensor or film 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:11.220
 If you enlarge the aperture of Blender Night on the 5 Coma 6 doubles 

00:05:11.220 --> 00:05:13.979
 the amount of light as well 

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:16.680
 when does it receive identical recording 

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:20.020
 if you increase the shutter speed by one level 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:23.020
 and reduce the aperture by one step 

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:27.090
 so could one or the other questions what the whole thing 

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:32.169
 yes I can with different schedules combinations 

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:35.169
 to achieve the same correct exposure 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:39.270
 then I can actually leave synonymous of the automatic camera 

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:42.749
 Yes and no 

00:05:42.749 --> 00:05:46.899
 what I am I have not mentioned so far is that we are using the aperture 

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:52.080
 not just the amount of incoming light on your film or sensor 

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:53.300
 can control 

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:58.590
 but that we also control the area with the iris i 

00:05:58.590 --> 00:05:59.850
 or to the 

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:03.620
 which is sharply reproduced within your photograph 

00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:08.060
 You may have heard of the concept of depth of field 

00:06:10.069 --> 00:06:12.229
 open aperture 

00:06:12.229 --> 00:06:15.459
 Percent leads to me only a small part 

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:20.450
 my photography sharply illustrated maybe you know that 

00:06:20.449 --> 00:06:22.690
 Portrait photos are gladly made 

00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:26.000
 the person in the foreground is sharp and the background 

00:06:26.559 --> 00:06:27.340
 Debt int 

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:31.539
 in blur dissolves into blur 

00:06:31.539 --> 00:06:34.100
 the secret of such a photograph is 

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:37.310
 The photographer has set a large open aperture 

00:06:38.669 --> 00:06:43.180
 he would have set a small aperture, for example, aperture 16 

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:45.439
 then it would be 

00:06:45.439 --> 00:06:48.360
 pictured area probably 

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:50.830
 almost continuous sharp 

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:52.460
 Person in the foreground 

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:55.790
 and the inter reason during Schaaf 

00:06:55.790 --> 00:06:58.950
 the person is no longer released by the blur 

00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:01.290
 so 

00:07:01.290 --> 00:07:07.479
 the bigger the more expensive aperture, the better the location is 

00:07:07.479 --> 00:07:10.479
 Dr promptly focus on the more focused 

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:17.069
 Sharp in both the back and in front of the subject is Jak Rolle that was 

00:07:17.069 --> 00:07:20.860
 Again, I hope this topic today was not that complicated 

00:07:21.449 --> 00:07:26.510
 he asks questions writes the comments but i am watching my videos i am pleased 

00:07:26.509 --> 00:07:28.189
 on you until next time 

00:07:28.189 --> 00:07:28.489
 Fire
