about<00:02:06.659> this<00:02:06.869> hair<00:02:07.080> is<00:02:07.110> that<00:02:07.470> it<00:02:07.590> does<00:02:07.770> shed

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:08.420 
about this hair is that it does shed

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:15.050 
about this hair is that it does shed
quite<00:02:09.420> a<00:02:09.450> bit<00:02:09.690> um<00:02:10.619> i<00:02:12.650> would<00:02:13.650> say<00:02:13.920> minimal<00:02:14.519> i<00:02:14.880> was

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
quite a bit um i would say minimal i was

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.839 
quite a bit um i would say minimal i was
going<00:02:15.180> to<00:02:15.209> say<00:02:15.269> minimal<00:02:15.720> and<00:02:15.900> wash<00:02:16.230> it<00:02:16.260> or

00:02:16.839 --> 00:02:16.849 
going to say minimal and wash it or

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:20.780 
going to say minimal and wash it or
condition<00:02:17.849> it<00:02:18.030> but<00:02:18.660> um<00:02:19.280> pretty<00:02:20.280> much<00:02:20.430> with<00:02:20.640> you

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
condition it but um pretty much with you

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.309 
condition it but um pretty much with you
if<00:02:20.970> you<00:02:21.120> run<00:02:21.299> your<00:02:21.480> hands<00:02:21.690> through<00:02:21.840> it<00:02:22.110> too

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
if you run your hands through it too

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:26.660 
if you run your hands through it too
much<00:02:22.500> it'll<00:02:23.069> shed<00:02:23.280> so<00:02:24.739> just<00:02:25.739> a<00:02:25.830> warning<00:02:26.069> if<00:02:26.489> you

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
much it'll shed so just a warning if you

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.820 
much it'll shed so just a warning if you
can<00:02:26.819> handle<00:02:27.030> that<00:02:27.239> I<00:02:27.810> didn't<00:02:28.319> sell<00:02:28.530> my<00:02:28.650> web

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:28.830 
can handle that I didn't sell my web

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:30.050 
can handle that I didn't sell my web
Seether<00:02:29.250> that's<00:02:29.400> probably<00:02:29.730> one<00:02:29.880> of<00:02:29.910> the

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
Seether that's probably one of the

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:33.110 
Seether that's probably one of the
reasons<00:02:30.090> but<00:02:30.750> even<00:02:31.319> i<00:02:31.650> think<00:02:32.220> if<00:02:32.400> i<00:02:32.519> did<00:02:32.760> semi

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120 
reasons but even i think if i did semi

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.850 
reasons but even i think if i did semi
webs<00:02:33.330> it<00:02:33.630> probably<00:02:34.019> still<00:02:34.230> shared<00:02:34.590> quite<00:02:34.830> a

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860 
webs it probably still shared quite a

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:37.190 
webs it probably still shared quite a
bit<00:02:35.099> but<00:02:35.640> the<00:02:35.790> only<00:02:35.910> way<00:02:36.120> it<00:02:36.810> can<00:02:36.959> get<00:02:37.110> away

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:37.200 
bit but the only way it can get away

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:39.680 
bit but the only way it can get away
with<00:02:37.530> it<00:02:37.709> it's<00:02:37.920> because<00:02:38.220> the<00:02:38.370> hair<00:02:38.549> is<00:02:38.580> so<00:02:39.000> big

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
with it it's because the hair is so big

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.080 
with it it's because the hair is so big
and<00:02:39.930> full<00:02:40.170> that<00:02:41.010> you<00:02:41.250> don't<00:02:41.430> really<00:02:41.519> notice<00:02:41.760> it

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090 
and full that you don't really notice it

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.240 
and full that you don't really notice it
when<00:02:42.540> you<00:02:42.690> wear<00:02:42.840> it<00:02:42.900> in<00:02:43.049> a<00:02:43.110> style<00:02:43.410> but<00:02:44.130> you

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
when you wear it in a style but you

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:45.559 
when you wear it in a style but you
notice<00:02:44.459> it<00:02:44.610> while<00:02:44.730> you're<00:02:44.819> styling<00:02:45.180> your<00:02:45.510> hair

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:45.569 
notice it while you're styling your hair

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:49.309 
notice it while you're styling your hair
so<00:02:46.470> um<00:02:46.890> if<00:02:47.190> you're<00:02:47.400> not<00:02:47.580> really<00:02:48.120> that<00:02:49.019> if

00:02:49.309 --> 00:02:49.319 
so um if you're not really that if

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:50.720 
so um if you're not really that if
shedding<00:02:49.709> is<00:02:49.769> really<00:02:49.950> not<00:02:50.040> that<00:02:50.190> important<00:02:50.640> to

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:50.730 
shedding is really not that important to

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.870 
shedding is really not that important to
you<00:02:50.760> or<00:02:50.910> you<00:02:51.330> can<00:02:51.450> handle<00:02:51.660> it<00:02:51.959> then<00:02:52.560> um<00:02:52.920> his

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:53.880 
you or you can handle it then um his

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.759 
you or you can handle it then um his

now and I've done so many things to it

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:12.710 
now and I've done so many things to it
dyeing<00:03:09.540> it<00:03:10.519> like<00:03:11.519> I<00:03:11.640> said<00:03:11.700> blow<00:03:12.150> drying<00:03:12.390> it<00:03:12.600> out

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
dyeing it like I said blow drying it out

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.840 
dyeing it like I said blow drying it out
and<00:03:13.109> then<00:03:13.140> using<00:03:13.769> the<00:03:13.859> curling<00:03:14.190> iron<00:03:14.310> and<00:03:14.579> then

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
and then using the curling iron and then

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:16.879 
and then using the curling iron and then
going<00:03:15.060> back<00:03:15.239> to<00:03:15.480> the<00:03:15.630> natural<00:03:16.049> state<00:03:16.319> every

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:16.889 
going back to the natural state every

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:19.640 
going back to the natural state every
once<00:03:17.069> in<00:03:17.190> a<00:03:17.250> while<00:03:17.370> so<00:03:17.760> it<00:03:18.720> does<00:03:18.959> hold<00:03:19.230> up<00:03:19.440> very

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
once in a while so it does hold up very

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.670 
once in a while so it does hold up very
well<00:03:19.920> and<00:03:20.459> the<00:03:21.150> luster<00:03:21.600> is<00:03:21.720> very<00:03:21.959> low<00:03:22.230> which<00:03:22.530> I

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
well and the luster is very low which I

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.620 
well and the luster is very low which I
likes<00:03:22.980> it<00:03:23.400> blends<00:03:23.730> in<00:03:23.819> with<00:03:23.910> my<00:03:24.090> leave<00:03:24.420> out

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:24.630 
likes it blends in with my leave out

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:28.789 
likes it blends in with my leave out
perfectly<00:03:25.260> and<00:03:26.190> it<00:03:26.700> looks<00:03:26.940> real<00:03:27.540> this<00:03:28.290> is<00:03:28.410> how

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:28.799 
perfectly and it looks real this is how

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:32.000 
perfectly and it looks real this is how
my<00:03:29.130> hair<00:03:29.340> used<00:03:29.700> to<00:03:29.880> look<00:03:30.090> before<00:03:30.870> I<00:03:31.079> cut<00:03:31.799> it<00:03:31.889> off

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.010 
my hair used to look before I cut it off

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.970 
my hair used to look before I cut it off
but<00:03:32.730> um<00:03:32.970> that's<00:03:33.930> another<00:03:34.260> reason<00:03:34.410> I<00:03:34.560> like<00:03:34.799> it

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:34.980 
but um that's another reason I like it

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:37.640 
but um that's another reason I like it
it<00:03:35.160> blends<00:03:35.639> in<00:03:35.760> with<00:03:35.940> my<00:03:36.150> leave<00:03:36.420> out<00:03:36.650> like

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:37.650 
it blends in with my leave out like

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:41.479 
it blends in with my leave out like
perfect<00:03:38.160> so<00:03:38.730> um<00:03:39.380> the<00:03:40.380> only<00:03:40.590> thing<00:03:40.859> like<00:03:41.130> i<00:03:41.250> said

00:03:41.479 --> 00:03:41.489 
perfect so um the only thing like i said

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:45.199 
perfect so um the only thing like i said
i<00:03:41.700> would<00:03:41.819> suggest<00:03:42.420> is<00:03:43.109> that<00:03:43.370> if<00:03:44.370> you<00:03:44.579> can't

00:03:45.199 --> 00:03:45.209 
i would suggest is that if you can't

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:47.690 
i would suggest is that if you can't
stand<00:03:45.480> a<00:03:45.600> lot<00:03:45.780> of<00:03:45.930> shedding<00:03:46.290> if<00:03:46.829> that's<00:03:47.220> a<00:03:47.519> big

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:47.700 
stand a lot of shedding if that's a big

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:48.880 
stand a lot of shedding if that's a big
issue<00:03:47.850> for<00:03:48.000> you<00:03:48.329> than<00:03:48.600> this

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:48.890 
issue for you than this

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:52.450 
issue for you than this
there<00:03:49.690> probably<00:03:50.690> isn't<00:03:50.960> for<00:03:51.230> you<00:03:51.380> or<00:03:51.830> if<00:03:52.220> you

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:52.460 
there probably isn't for you or if you

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:55.270 
there probably isn't for you or if you
are<00:03:52.490> not<00:03:52.819> used<00:03:53.300> to<00:03:53.569> a<00:03:53.990> maintaining<00:03:54.950> kinky

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.280 
are not used to a maintaining kinky

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.760 
are not used to a maintaining kinky
curly<00:03:55.640> hair<00:03:55.880> this<00:03:56.240> hair<00:03:56.270> probably<00:03:57.110> isn't<00:03:57.590> for

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:57.770 
curly hair this hair probably isn't for

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:01.449 
curly hair this hair probably isn't for
you<00:03:57.860> because<00:03:58.370> it<00:03:58.910> does<00:03:59.980> involve<00:04:00.980> a<00:04:01.220> lot<00:04:01.250> of

00:04:01.449 --> 00:04:01.459 
you because it does involve a lot of

00:04:01.459 --> 00:04:04.809 
you because it does involve a lot of
maintenance<00:04:01.760> at<00:04:02.330> night<00:04:02.660> and<00:04:03.459> it<00:04:04.459> does<00:04:04.640> a<00:04:04.670> lot

00:04:04.809 --> 00:04:04.819 
maintenance at night and it does a lot
