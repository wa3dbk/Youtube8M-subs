shoe from the seams down here and it's

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:12.430 
shoe from the seams down here and it's
like<00:04:10.100> the<00:04:10.370> katys<00:04:11.110> has

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:12.440 
like the katys has

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:17.150 
that's all like Wayne thing so I guess

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:18.910

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:25.760 
because we are the shoe but overall the

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:28.630 
because we are the shoe but overall the
shoe<00:04:26.000> is<00:04:26.120> great<00:04:26.330> for<00:04:26.510> basketball<00:04:27.430> only<00:04:28.430> bad

of<00:04:38.810> course<00:04:39.050> and<00:04:39.590> then<00:04:40.810> the<00:04:41.810> upper<00:04:42.230> is<00:04:42.680> all<00:04:42.980> just

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:43.220 
of course and then the upper is all just

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:48.840 
of course and then the upper is all just
like<00:04:43.400> one<00:04:43.700> big<00:04:43.940> mesh<00:04:44.210> part<00:04:46.090> with<00:04:47.090> this<00:04:47.330> little

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:48.850

00:04:59.620 --> 00:04:59.630 
here and all mesh right here they should

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:01.180
