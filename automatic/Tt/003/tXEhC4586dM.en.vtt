00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
didn't want to go too hard with the

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.090 
didn't want to go too hard with the
national<00:00:22.109> team<00:00:22.170> players<00:00:22.289> that<00:00:22.650> just<00:00:22.680> got<00:00:22.949> in

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100 
national team players that just got in

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.620
