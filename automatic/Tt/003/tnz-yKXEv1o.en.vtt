00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
one is talking about subtle hints

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:20.870 
one is talking about subtle hints
towards<00:00:19.320> five<00:00:19.740> nights<00:00:19.980> at<00:00:20.070> freddy's<00:00:20.340> 4<00:00:20.369> and

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:20.880

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.759 
towards five nights at freddy's 4 and
the<00:00:21.060> game<00:00:21.270> mechanics<00:00:21.510> yes<00:00:22.380> and<00:00:22.529> this<00:00:22.619> is

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
the game mechanics yes and this is

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.830 
the game mechanics yes and this is
actually<00:00:23.160> a<00:00:23.189> fan<00:00:23.609> theory<00:00:24.150> but<00:00:24.390> he<00:00:24.449> goes<00:00:24.600> by<00:00:24.630> the

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:24.840 
actually a fan theory but he goes by the

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:27.109 
actually a fan theory but he goes by the

their<00:00:29.099> theory<00:00:29.460> is<00:00:29.670> basically<00:00:29.970> saying<00:00:30.570> that

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:30.689 
their theory is basically saying that

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.350 
their theory is basically saying that
the<00:00:31.050> eyes<00:00:31.260> we<00:00:31.619> see<00:00:31.859> in<00:00:32.040> scottgames.com<00:00:32.369> may

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
the eyes we see in scottgames.com may

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.450 
the eyes we see in scottgames.com may
represent<00:00:33.930> the<00:00:34.110> game<00:00:34.380> mechanics<00:00:34.620> and<00:00:35.130> also

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
represent the game mechanics and also

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.280 
represent the game mechanics and also
previous<00:00:35.940> game<00:00:36.149> mechanics<00:00:36.660> in<00:00:36.780> five<00:00:37.110> nights

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:37.290 
previous game mechanics in five nights

previous game mechanics in five nights
at<00:00:37.500> freddys<00:00:37.829> yeah<00:00:38.219> because<00:00:38.430> if<00:00:38.640> you<00:00:38.700> actually

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:38.820 
at freddys yeah because if you actually

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:39.979 
at freddys yeah because if you actually
look<00:00:39.120> at<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.300> way<00:00:39.420> the<00:00:39.540> eyes<00:00:39.719> have<00:00:39.899> been

00:00:39.979 --> 00:00:39.989 
look at the way the eyes have been

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:41.540 
look at the way the eyes have been
illuminated<00:00:40.260> in<00:00:40.710> the<00:00:40.800> various<00:00:41.070> images<00:00:41.399> we've

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
illuminated in the various images we've

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.520 
illuminated in the various images we've
seen<00:00:41.820> it's<00:00:42.030> hinted<00:00:42.390> towards<00:00:42.570> almost<00:00:43.290> well

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
seen it's hinted towards almost well

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:44.779 
seen it's hinted towards almost well
it's<00:00:43.620> almost<00:00:43.739> like<00:00:43.890> a<00:00:43.980> back<00:00:44.190> flash<00:00:44.520> towards

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789 
it's almost like a back flash towards

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:46.729 
it's almost like a back flash towards
five<00:00:44.940> Nazis<00:00:45.239> one<00:00:45.660> isn't<00:00:45.930> in<00:00:46.050> the<00:00:46.289> corridors

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
five Nazis one isn't in the corridors

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:47.930 
five Nazis one isn't in the corridors
that<00:00:46.890> each<00:00:47.010> of<00:00:47.129> the<00:00:47.190> animatronics<00:00:47.430> used<00:00:47.850> to

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
that each of the animatronics used to

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.000 
that each of the animatronics used to
come<00:00:48.149> down<00:00:48.420> yeah<00:00:48.870> because<00:00:49.230> as<00:00:49.350> we<00:00:49.500> see<00:00:49.710> right

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:50.010

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
are glowing and as we know no met she

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.110 
are glowing and as we know no met she
came<00:00:55.500> from<00:00:55.620> the<00:00:55.710> right<00:00:55.980> hallway<00:00:56.579> yeah<00:00:56.969> and

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
came from the right hallway yeah and

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.610 
came from the right hallway yeah and
when<00:00:57.390> we<00:00:57.420> look<00:00:57.690> at<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:57.899> nightmare<00:00:58.320> body

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
when we look at the nightmare body

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.830 
when we look at the nightmare body
poster<00:00:59.160> we<00:00:59.309> can<00:00:59.460> see<00:00:59.640> that<00:00:59.910> the<00:01:00.059> left<00:01:00.359> eye<00:01:00.570> is

00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:00.840 
poster we can see that the left eye is

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.540 
poster we can see that the left eye is
significantly<00:01:01.440> brighter<00:01:01.800> than<00:01:02.190> the<00:01:02.340> right

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
significantly brighter than the right

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.399 
significantly brighter than the right
eye<00:01:02.579> and<00:01:03.059> we<00:01:03.420> know<00:01:03.539> that<00:01:03.719> bonnie<00:01:03.989> actually

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
eye and we know that bonnie actually

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:06.830 
eye and we know that bonnie actually
comes<00:01:04.589> from<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:04.890> left<00:01:05.100> side<00:01:05.400> exactly<00:01:06.330> so<00:01:06.570> it's

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
comes from the left side exactly so it's

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.600 
comes from the left side exactly so it's
kind<00:01:07.080> of<00:01:07.140> like<00:01:07.290> almost<00:01:07.500> a<00:01:07.680> hint<00:01:07.920> towards<00:01:08.070> five

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
kind of like almost a hint towards five

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:09.710 
kind of like almost a hint towards five
months<00:01:08.820> at<00:01:08.909> Freddy's<00:01:09.119> 1<00:01:09.150> and<00:01:09.450> it<00:01:09.510> might

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
months at Freddy's 1 and it might

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.120 
months at Freddy's 1 and it might
actually<00:01:09.869> be<00:01:10.170> a<00:01:10.200> hint<00:01:10.380> it<00:01:10.470> was<00:01:10.650> five<00:01:10.830> nights<00:01:11.040> at

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
actually be a hint it was five nights at

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.070 
actually be a hint it was five nights at
freddy's<00:01:11.369> 4<00:01:11.400> game<00:01:11.970> mechanics<00:01:12.420> and<00:01:12.600> maybe<00:01:12.930> a

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
freddy's 4 game mechanics and maybe a

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.230 
freddy's 4 game mechanics and maybe a
returning<00:01:13.439> feature<00:01:13.799> we<00:01:14.010> might<00:01:14.220> see<00:01:14.490> yes<00:01:14.850> as<00:01:15.090> we

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
returning feature we might see yes as we

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.030 
returning feature we might see yes as we
know<00:01:15.390> five<00:01:15.689> nights<00:01:15.930> at<00:01:16.049> freddy's<00:01:16.350> it<00:01:16.619> was<00:01:16.799> the

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
know five nights at freddy's it was the

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.940 
know five nights at freddy's it was the
distinguished<00:01:17.850> doors<00:01:18.270> that<00:01:18.689> were<00:01:19.439> never<00:01:19.650> seen

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
distinguished doors that were never seen

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.770 
distinguished doors that were never seen
again<00:01:19.979> after<00:01:20.400> five<00:01:20.700> nights<00:01:20.909> at<00:01:21.090> Freddy's<00:01:21.330> 1<00:01:21.509> so

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:21.780 
again after five nights at Freddy's 1 so

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:22.850 
again after five nights at Freddy's 1 so
yeah<00:01:22.080> hopefully<00:01:22.290> we're<00:01:22.680> actually

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
yeah hopefully we're actually

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.410 
yeah hopefully we're actually
reintroduced<00:01:23.670> to<00:01:23.850> some<00:01:24.030> of<00:01:24.119> the<00:01:24.210> game

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
reintroduced to some of the game

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.510 
reintroduced to some of the game
mechanics<00:01:24.630> we<00:01:25.020> had<00:01:25.229> within<00:01:25.590> that<00:01:25.830> game<00:01:26.130> yeah<00:01:26.490> I

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
mechanics we had within that game yeah I

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.859 
mechanics we had within that game yeah I
was<00:01:26.640> gonna<00:01:26.729> say<00:01:26.970> I<00:01:27.000> think<00:01:27.119> everyone<00:01:27.570> loved<00:01:27.780> the

00:01:27.859 --> 00:01:27.869 
was gonna say I think everyone loved the

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:29.810 
was gonna say I think everyone loved the
whole<00:01:28.020> door<00:01:28.380> mechanic<00:01:29.159> within<00:01:29.460> five<00:01:29.640> nights

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
whole door mechanic within five nights

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:30.830 
whole door mechanic within five nights
at<00:01:29.909> Freddy's<00:01:30.119> one<00:01:30.329> didn't<00:01:30.570> there<00:01:30.689> was<00:01:30.720> a

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
at Freddy's one didn't there was a

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.539 
at Freddy's one didn't there was a
really<00:01:31.200> er<00:01:31.229> original<00:01:31.950> feature<00:01:32.159> is<00:01:32.430> actually

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
really er original feature is actually

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.010

that's pretty fun if you had to keep an
eye<00:01:47.009> on<00:01:47.040> flash<00:01:47.310> fire<00:01:47.490> but<00:01:47.610> that<00:01:47.640> was<00:01:47.790> only<00:01:47.850> one

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
eye on flash fire but that was only one

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:50.179 
eye on flash fire but that was only one
thing<00:01:48.390> whereas<00:01:48.840> power<00:01:49.200> is<00:01:49.590> manipulated<00:01:50.159> by

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
thing whereas power is manipulated by

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:52.880 
thing whereas power is manipulated by
multiple<00:01:50.759> things<00:01:50.970> like<00:01:51.210> lures<00:01:51.960> so<00:01:52.290> yeah<00:01:52.680> it's

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890 
multiple things like lures so yeah it's

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.410 
multiple things like lures so yeah it's
a<00:01:52.950> bit<00:01:53.130> more<00:01:53.369> intimidating<00:01:53.970> like<00:01:54.090> you<00:01:54.210> say

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:54.420 
a bit more intimidating like you say

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:55.850 
a bit more intimidating like you say
yeah<00:01:54.810> and<00:01:54.899> you<00:01:54.960> could<00:01:55.140> kind<00:01:55.380> of<00:01:55.470> build<00:01:55.710> the

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
yeah and you could kind of build the

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:57.230 
yeah and you could kind of build the
whole<00:01:56.040> power<00:01:56.310> thing<00:01:56.610> up<00:01:56.759> as<00:01:56.880> well<00:01:57.030> couldn't

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
whole power thing up as well couldn't

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.609 
whole power thing up as well couldn't
you<00:01:57.299> if<00:01:57.360> you<00:01:57.420> had<00:01:57.570> both<00:01:57.780> doors<00:01:58.079> closed<00:01:58.409> and

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
you if you had both doors closed and

00:01:58.619 --> 00:01:59.929 
you if you had both doors closed and
then<00:01:58.710> a<00:01:58.799> light<00:01:59.040> on<00:01:59.280> at<00:01:59.369> the<00:01:59.460> same<00:01:59.610> time<00:01:59.850> we

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
then a light on at the same time we

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.429 
then a light on at the same time we
would<00:02:00.030> really<00:02:00.299> drain<00:02:00.570> the<00:02:00.689> power<00:02:00.810> quickly<00:02:01.170> and

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 
would really drain the power quickly and

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:02.780 
would really drain the power quickly and
it<00:02:01.590> was<00:02:01.710> just<00:02:01.890> one<00:02:02.009> of<00:02:02.040> those<00:02:02.189> game<00:02:02.460> mechanics

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790 
it was just one of those game mechanics

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:03.800 
it was just one of those game mechanics
where<00:02:02.880> you've<00:02:03.000> really<00:02:03.299> had<00:02:03.420> to<00:02:03.570> think<00:02:03.689> about

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
where you've really had to think about

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.149 
where you've really had to think about
what<00:02:04.079> you<00:02:04.170> was<00:02:04.290> doing<00:02:04.560> to<00:02:04.649> make<00:02:04.799> sure<00:02:04.950> that<00:02:05.040> you

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
what you was doing to make sure that you

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:06.920 
what you was doing to make sure that you
didn't<00:02:05.490> kind<00:02:05.729> of<00:02:05.880> seal<00:02:06.299> your<00:02:06.420> own<00:02:06.479> fate<00:02:06.899> I

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:06.930 
didn't kind of seal your own fate I

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:08.690 
didn't kind of seal your own fate I
suppose<00:02:07.290> you<00:02:07.439> could<00:02:07.590> say<00:02:07.619> so<00:02:08.190> now<00:02:08.489> we're<00:02:08.580> going

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
suppose you could say so now we're going

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.070 
suppose you could say so now we're going
to<00:02:08.759> be<00:02:08.879> moving<00:02:09.000> over<00:02:09.330> to<00:02:09.479> nightmare<00:02:09.840> Freddy

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.080 
to be moving over to nightmare Freddy

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:12.140 
to be moving over to nightmare Freddy
because<00:02:10.410> nightmare<00:02:10.979> Freddy's<00:02:11.250> a<00:02:11.280> unique<00:02:11.849> one

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
because nightmare Freddy's a unique one

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.400 
because nightmare Freddy's a unique one
as<00:02:12.330> in<00:02:12.720> both

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
as in both

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.320 
as in both
are<00:02:13.500> not<00:02:13.770> actually<00:02:14.070> illuminated<00:02:14.730> so<00:02:14.940> what

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:15.330 
are not actually illuminated so what

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:17.390 
are not actually illuminated so what
could<00:02:15.480> this<00:02:15.600> mean<00:02:15.660> we're<00:02:16.200> no<00:02:16.320> Freddie<00:02:16.890> hardly

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400 
could this mean we're no Freddie hardly

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.610 
could this mean we're no Freddie hardly

eyes<00:02:48.000> thing<00:02:48.270> when<00:02:48.510> you<00:02:48.600> actually<00:02:48.720> think<00:02:49.080> about

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:49.170 
eyes thing when you actually think about

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:50.750 
eyes thing when you actually think about
how<00:02:49.320> Freddy<00:02:49.710> can<00:02:49.920> come<00:02:50.070> and<00:02:50.160> kill<00:02:50.370> you<00:02:50.490> in<00:02:50.610> five

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:50.760 
how Freddy can come and kill you in five

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:51.620 
how Freddy can come and kill you in five
nights<00:02:50.850> at<00:02:50.970> Freddy's<00:02:51.180> one<00:02:51.300> he<00:02:51.390> can<00:02:51.510> actually

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:51.630 
nights at Freddy's one he can actually

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.720 
nights at Freddy's one he can actually
attack<00:02:52.080> from<00:02:52.230> either<00:02:52.410> corridor<00:02:52.950> Canty<00:02:53.340> yes

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:53.730 
attack from either corridor Canty yes

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:55.400 
attack from either corridor Canty yes
yeah<00:02:54.150> maybe<00:02:54.390> that's<00:02:54.630> a<00:02:54.780> hint<00:02:54.930> towards<00:02:55.020> why

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 
yeah maybe that's a hint towards why

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:56.870 
yeah maybe that's a hint towards why
he's<00:02:55.710> actually<00:02:55.860> not<00:02:56.070> got<00:02:56.250> these<00:02:56.370> going<00:02:56.730> eyes<00:02:56.850> I

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:56.880 
he's actually not got these going eyes I

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.430 
he's actually not got these going eyes I
mean<00:02:57.090> Freddy<00:02:57.300> could<00:02:57.480> come<00:02:57.690> down<00:02:57.960> the<00:02:58.230> I

00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:58.440 
mean Freddy could come down the I

00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:59.840 
mean Freddy could come down the I
believe<00:02:58.740> the<00:02:58.860> left<00:02:59.100> hand<00:02:59.340> side<00:02:59.550> if<00:02:59.730> you

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
believe the left hand side if you

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:01.520 
believe the left hand side if you
actually<00:03:00.150> ran<00:03:00.420> to<00:03:00.570> power<00:03:00.810> but<00:03:00.990> if<00:03:01.110> you<00:03:01.290> don't

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
actually ran to power but if you don't

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:03.020 
actually ran to power but if you don't
run<00:03:01.650> out<00:03:01.740> of<00:03:01.770> power<00:03:01.950> in<00:03:02.040> its<00:03:02.220> night<00:03:02.430> for<00:03:02.730> and<00:03:02.880> he

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
run out of power in its night for and he

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:04.280 
run out of power in its night for and he
could<00:03:03.180> be<00:03:03.270> looking<00:03:03.420> into<00:03:03.630> the<00:03:03.720> camera<00:03:03.960> of<00:03:04.110> East

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290 
could be looking into the camera of East

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:05.570 
could be looking into the camera of East
Hall<00:03:04.500> then<00:03:04.740> you<00:03:04.920> can<00:03:05.010> actually<00:03:05.100> come<00:03:05.340> straight

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:05.580 
Hall then you can actually come straight

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:06.560 
Hall then you can actually come straight
in<00:03:05.640> your<00:03:05.730> office<00:03:05.910> and<00:03:06.060> kill<00:03:06.210> you<00:03:06.300> from<00:03:06.450> the

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:06.570 
in your office and kill you from the

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.420 
in your office and kill you from the
right<00:03:06.810> yeah<00:03:07.320> and<00:03:07.440> that's<00:03:07.590> when<00:03:07.860> we<00:03:08.040> see<00:03:08.220> him

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
right yeah and that's when we see him

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.460 
right yeah and that's when we see him
with<00:03:08.610> his<00:03:08.790> like<00:03:09.030> distinct<00:03:09.840> white<00:03:10.140> glowing

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:10.470 
with his like distinct white glowing

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:13.070 
with his like distinct white glowing
eyes<00:03:10.740> yes<00:03:11.220> so<00:03:11.760> yeah<00:03:12.180> you<00:03:12.420> know<00:03:12.450> he's<00:03:12.750> gonna<00:03:12.900> get

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:13.080 
eyes yes so yeah you know he's gonna get

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:14.660 
eyes yes so yeah you know he's gonna get
you<00:03:13.230> when<00:03:13.350> you<00:03:13.440> see<00:03:13.590> that<00:03:13.770> so<00:03:13.980> maybe<00:03:14.370> that

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:14.670 
you when you see that so maybe that

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:16.130 
you when you see that so maybe that
could<00:03:14.850> be<00:03:14.910> a<00:03:15.030> hint<00:03:15.240> towards<00:03:15.360> how<00:03:15.630> we<00:03:15.660> might<00:03:15.930> see

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
could be a hint towards how we might see

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.170 
could be a hint towards how we might see
Freddy<00:03:16.410> also<00:03:16.980> act<00:03:17.190> within<00:03:17.550> this<00:03:17.670> next<00:03:17.880> game

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:18.180 
Freddy also act within this next game

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:20.150 
Freddy also act within this next game
and<00:03:18.390> I<00:03:18.510> think<00:03:18.780> it<00:03:18.870> possibly<00:03:19.200> moves<00:03:19.500> on<00:03:19.680> to<00:03:19.860> what

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
and I think it possibly moves on to what

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:21.470 
and I think it possibly moves on to what
other<00:03:20.310> things<00:03:20.550> could<00:03:20.700> be<00:03:20.820> possibly<00:03:21.240> see

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:21.480 
other things could be possibly see

00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:23.120 
other things could be possibly see
within<00:03:21.660> five<00:03:21.810> nights<00:03:21.990> at<00:03:22.080> Freddy's<00:03:22.350> 4<00:03:22.380> return

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:23.130 
within five nights at Freddy's 4 return

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:25.310 
within five nights at Freddy's 4 return
so<00:03:23.490> yeah<00:03:23.610> we<00:03:23.760> believe<00:03:23.880> that<00:03:24.180> maybe<00:03:24.420> doors<00:03:25.020> and

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:25.320 
so yeah we believe that maybe doors and

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:27.199 
so yeah we believe that maybe doors and
vents<00:03:25.590> may<00:03:25.950> be<00:03:26.010> reintroduced<00:03:26.760> into<00:03:26.970> five

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:27.209 
vents may be reintroduced into five

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:28.640 
vents may be reintroduced into five
nights<00:03:27.450> Freddy's<00:03:27.750> 4<00:03:27.780> because<00:03:28.260> if<00:03:28.380> this<00:03:28.530> is

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
nights Freddy's 4 because if this is

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.740 
nights Freddy's 4 because if this is
indeed<00:03:28.980> the<00:03:29.250> final<00:03:29.670> chapter<00:03:30.180> then<00:03:30.360> Scott's

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
indeed the final chapter then Scott's

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.300 
indeed the final chapter then Scott's
gonna<00:03:30.870> really<00:03:31.200> want<00:03:31.440> to<00:03:31.560> put<00:03:31.770> a<00:03:31.800> bit<00:03:31.950> of<00:03:32.040> each

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
gonna really want to put a bit of each

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.699 
gonna really want to put a bit of each
game<00:03:32.640> into<00:03:33.120> the<00:03:33.240> final<00:03:33.720> thing<00:03:34.050> yeah<00:03:34.530> I<00:03:34.560> think

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
game into the final thing yeah I think

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:35.810 
game into the final thing yeah I think
we're<00:03:34.950> gonna<00:03:35.040> be<00:03:35.160> seeing<00:03:35.400> a<00:03:35.520> return<00:03:35.640> of

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:35.820 
we're gonna be seeing a return of

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:37.820 
we're gonna be seeing a return of
possibly<00:03:36.330> more<00:03:36.660> the<00:03:37.110> animatronics<00:03:37.709> other

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:37.830 
possibly more the animatronics other

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:39.380 
possibly more the animatronics other
than<00:03:38.040> just<00:03:38.250> these<00:03:38.340> nightmare<00:03:38.880> ones<00:03:39.030> I<00:03:39.150> think

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
than just these nightmare ones I think

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:41.240 
than just these nightmare ones I think
the<00:03:39.810> reason<00:03:40.140> why<00:03:40.260> we've<00:03:40.440> seen<00:03:40.560> a<00:03:40.590> big<00:03:40.770> focus<00:03:41.130> on

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:41.250 
the reason why we've seen a big focus on

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:42.949 
the reason why we've seen a big focus on
the<00:03:41.340> website<00:03:41.760> about<00:03:42.180> these<00:03:42.360> nightmare<00:03:42.810> guys

00:03:42.949 --> 00:03:42.959 
the website about these nightmare guys

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:44.090 
the website about these nightmare guys
is<00:03:43.140> just<00:03:43.290> because<00:03:43.590> they're<00:03:43.770> brand-new

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:44.100 
is just because they're brand-new

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:46.100 
is just because they're brand-new
animatronics<00:03:44.910> it's<00:03:45.150> like<00:03:45.360> you<00:03:45.720> know<00:03:45.840> we<00:03:45.959> saw<00:03:46.080> a

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:46.110 
animatronics it's like you know we saw a

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:47.780 
animatronics it's like you know we saw a
lot<00:03:46.200> of<00:03:46.320> teasers<00:03:46.739> in<00:03:46.830> regards<00:03:47.190> to<00:03:47.220> spring-trap

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:47.790 
lot of teasers in regards to spring-trap

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:49.850 
lot of teasers in regards to spring-trap
and<00:03:48.000> we<00:03:48.150> didn't<00:03:48.390> really<00:03:48.480> at<00:03:48.780> first<00:03:49.080> understand

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:49.860 
and we didn't really at first understand

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:50.990 
and we didn't really at first understand
that<00:03:49.890> there<00:03:50.040> was<00:03:50.160> going<00:03:50.250> to<00:03:50.310> be<00:03:50.370> these<00:03:50.550> relics

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:51.000 
that there was going to be these relics

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.090 
that there was going to be these relics
of<00:03:51.209> the<00:03:51.239> old<00:03:51.450> animatronics<00:03:52.380> around<00:03:53.010> the

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:53.100 
of the old animatronics around the

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:54.680 
of the old animatronics around the
establishment<00:03:53.610> until<00:03:53.730> Scott<00:03:54.300> released<00:03:54.570> a

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
establishment until Scott released a

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:56.270 
establishment until Scott released a
teaser<00:03:54.840> trailer<00:03:55.170> and<00:03:55.500> a<00:03:55.560> lot<00:03:55.770> of<00:03:55.800> the<00:03:55.950> website

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:56.280 
teaser trailer and a lot of the website

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:57.620 
teaser trailer and a lot of the website
was<00:03:56.400> focused<00:03:56.730> towards<00:03:57.030> this<00:03:57.180> new<00:03:57.390> character

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:57.630 
was focused towards this new character

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.660 
was focused towards this new character
so<00:03:58.050> maybe<00:03:58.410> he's<00:03:58.650> following<00:03:59.040> a<00:03:59.130> similar<00:03:59.340> chain

00:03:59.660 --> 00:03:59.670 
so maybe he's following a similar chain

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:01.100 
so maybe he's following a similar chain
with<00:03:59.790> these<00:03:59.910> nightmare<00:04:00.330> guys<00:04:00.480> just<00:04:00.810> so<00:04:00.959> we

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:01.110 
with these nightmare guys just so we

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:02.449 
with these nightmare guys just so we
know<00:04:01.290> who<00:04:01.440> they<00:04:01.590> are<00:04:01.620> and<00:04:01.890> we<00:04:02.070> might<00:04:02.280> actually

00:04:02.449 --> 00:04:02.459 
know who they are and we might actually

00:04:02.459 --> 00:04:04.100 
know who they are and we might actually
see<00:04:02.640> all<00:04:03.000> of<00:04:03.030> these<00:04:03.180> other<00:04:03.239> guys<00:04:03.570> in<00:04:03.750> and<00:04:03.900> that

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:04.110 
see all of these other guys in and that

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:05.449 
see all of these other guys in and that
would<00:04:04.290> probably<00:04:04.500> incorporate<00:04:05.130> some<00:04:05.310> of<00:04:05.340> the

00:04:05.449 --> 00:04:05.459 
would probably incorporate some of the

00:04:05.459 --> 00:04:07.160 
would probably incorporate some of the
old<00:04:05.580> game<00:04:05.850> mechanics<00:04:06.270> just<00:04:06.510> like<00:04:06.660> last<00:04:06.930> time<00:04:07.110> I

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:07.170 
old game mechanics just like last time I

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:08.630 
old game mechanics just like last time I
mean<00:04:07.410> as<00:04:07.560> you<00:04:07.709> said<00:04:07.860> we<00:04:08.010> had<00:04:08.160> the<00:04:08.280> vents<00:04:08.520> and

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:08.640 
mean as you said we had the vents and

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:10.160 
mean as you said we had the vents and
five<00:04:08.790> nights<00:04:08.910> at<00:04:09.090> Freddy's<00:04:09.300> 2<00:04:09.330> and<00:04:09.660> I<00:04:09.810> think<00:04:10.080> we

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:10.170 
five nights at Freddy's 2 and I think we

00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:11.690 
five nights at Freddy's 2 and I think we
may<00:04:10.350> be<00:04:10.410> seeing<00:04:10.709> a<00:04:10.800> return<00:04:10.920> of<00:04:11.190> some<00:04:11.400> newer

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700 
may be seeing a return of some newer

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:14.030 
may be seeing a return of some newer
mechanics<00:04:12.510> as<00:04:12.660> well<00:04:12.900> yeah<00:04:13.470> I<00:04:13.500> mean<00:04:13.770> possibly

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
mechanics as well yeah I mean possibly

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:17.210 
mechanics as well yeah I mean possibly
like<00:04:15.000> we<00:04:15.150> might<00:04:15.360> get<00:04:15.540> some<00:04:15.720> updated<00:04:16.410> devices<00:04:17.100> I

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:17.220 
like we might get some updated devices I

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.010 
like we might get some updated devices I
can<00:04:17.250> five<00:04:17.580> nights<00:04:17.820> at<00:04:17.970> Freddy's<00:04:18.209> 3<00:04:18.239> oh<00:04:18.780> yeah

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:19.020 
can five nights at Freddy's 3 oh yeah

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:21.050 
can five nights at Freddy's 3 oh yeah
because<00:04:19.169> those<00:04:19.620> devices<00:04:19.980> were<00:04:20.310> so<00:04:20.489> ancient

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
because those devices were so ancient

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.240 
because those devices were so ancient
like<00:04:21.299> they<00:04:21.600> obviously<00:04:21.960> caused<00:04:22.440> a<00:04:22.620> fire<00:04:22.919> in<00:04:23.160> the

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.250 
like they obviously caused a fire in the

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:25.370 
like they obviously caused a fire in the
end<00:04:23.400> well<00:04:23.669> supposedly<00:04:24.419> supposedly<00:04:24.810> yeah<00:04:25.110> yeah

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:25.380 
end well supposedly supposedly yeah yeah

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:26.960 
end well supposedly supposedly yeah yeah
so<00:04:25.620> maybe<00:04:25.830> these<00:04:26.130> nightmare

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:26.970 
so maybe these nightmare

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:29.150 
so maybe these nightmare
tronics<00:04:27.270> will<00:04:27.450> actually<00:04:27.990> react<00:04:28.590> what<00:04:28.980> their

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.160 
tronics will actually react what their

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.250 
tronics will actually react what their
previous<00:04:29.490> like<00:04:30.150> animatronics<00:04:30.870> did<00:04:31.050> with

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:31.260 
previous like animatronics did with

00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:32.810 
previous like animatronics did with
Bonnie<00:04:31.710> coming<00:04:32.040> from<00:04:32.130> the<00:04:32.250> left<00:04:32.430> she<00:04:32.610> come

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:32.820 
Bonnie coming from the left she come

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:34.460 
Bonnie coming from the left she come
from<00:04:32.970> the<00:04:33.030> right<00:04:33.210> but<00:04:33.360> instead<00:04:33.510> of<00:04:33.720> just<00:04:34.020> the

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:34.470 
from the right but instead of just the

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:36.290 
from the right but instead of just the
normal<00:04:34.640> animatronics<00:04:35.640> they<00:04:35.760> might<00:04:35.940> be<00:04:36.060> this

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
normal animatronics they might be this

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:39.590 
normal animatronics they might be this
nightmarish<00:04:37.040> horrible<00:04:38.060> animatronics<00:04:39.060> yeah<00:04:39.540> I

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:39.600 
nightmarish horrible animatronics yeah I

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.330 
nightmarish horrible animatronics yeah I
agree<00:04:40.050> and<00:04:40.140> I<00:04:40.200> think<00:04:40.230> the<00:04:40.770> final<00:04:41.130> point<00:04:41.280> we

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 
agree and I think the final point we

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:42.470 
agree and I think the final point we
should<00:04:41.460> probably<00:04:41.580> think<00:04:41.820> about<00:04:41.940> is<00:04:42.150> of<00:04:42.240> course

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:42.480 
should probably think about is of course

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:43.760 
should probably think about is of course
because<00:04:42.810> it's<00:04:42.960> a<00:04:43.020> new<00:04:43.140> game<00:04:43.290> Scott's<00:04:43.590> gonna

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:43.770 
because it's a new game Scott's gonna

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:44.870 
because it's a new game Scott's gonna
definitely<00:04:44.010> introduce<00:04:44.460> something<00:04:44.700> new

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:44.880 
definitely introduce something new

00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:46.730 
definitely introduce something new
towards<00:04:45.750> the<00:04:45.870> game<00:04:46.050> I<00:04:46.200> mean<00:04:46.380> five<00:04:46.530> nights<00:04:46.680> at

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:46.740 
towards the game I mean five nights at

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:47.810 
towards the game I mean five nights at
Freddy's<00:04:46.950> one<00:04:47.070> of<00:04:47.160> course<00:04:47.340> we<00:04:47.430> had<00:04:47.520> the<00:04:47.550> doors

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:47.820 
Freddy's one of course we had the doors

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:48.860 
Freddy's one of course we had the doors
and<00:04:47.940> that<00:04:48.060> was<00:04:48.150> all<00:04:48.270> new<00:04:48.390> five<00:04:48.600> nights<00:04:48.780> at

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:48.870 
and that was all new five nights at

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:50.720 
and that was all new five nights at
Freddy's<00:04:49.080> 2<00:04:49.110> he<00:04:49.410> introduced<00:04:49.860> the<00:04:50.040> ventilation

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:50.730 
Freddy's 2 he introduced the ventilation

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:52.070 
Freddy's 2 he introduced the ventilation
system<00:04:51.090> and<00:04:51.150> in<00:04:51.300> five<00:04:51.480> nights<00:04:51.690> at<00:04:51.780> Freddy's<00:04:52.050> 3

00:04:52.070 --> 00:04:52.080 
system and in five nights at Freddy's 3

00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:54.230 
system and in five nights at Freddy's 3
introduced<00:04:53.010> the<00:04:53.220> ventilation<00:04:53.760> system<00:04:54.030> to<00:04:54.210> a

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:54.240 
introduced the ventilation system to a

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:55.670 
introduced the ventilation system to a
different<00:04:54.780> degree<00:04:54.930> it<00:04:55.320> was<00:04:55.410> a<00:04:55.440> whole

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:55.680 
different degree it was a whole

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:56.750 
different degree it was a whole
different<00:04:55.710> way<00:04:56.190> of<00:04:56.220> playing<00:04:56.370> it<00:04:56.610> you<00:04:56.670> know

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:56.760 
different way of playing it you know

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:58.280 
different way of playing it you know
where<00:04:56.880> you<00:04:56.970> had<00:04:57.060> to<00:04:57.180> close<00:04:57.420> the<00:04:57.690> doors<00:04:57.930> off<00:04:58.140> all

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:58.290 
where you had to close the doors off all

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:00.230 
where you had to close the doors off all
the<00:04:58.410> vents<00:04:58.770> even<00:04:59.070> to<00:04:59.190> stop<00:04:59.430> spring-trap<00:05:00.000> kind

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:00.240 
the vents even to stop spring-trap kind

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:01.790 
the vents even to stop spring-trap kind
of<00:05:00.330> traversing<00:05:00.900> through<00:05:01.170> them<00:05:01.350> you<00:05:01.680> know

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:01.800 
of traversing through them you know

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.380 
of traversing through them you know
Falls<00:05:02.130> gonna<00:05:02.340> be<00:05:02.520> there's<00:05:02.850> gonna<00:05:02.940> be<00:05:03.090> a<00:05:03.120> lot<00:05:03.300> of

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:03.390 
Falls gonna be there's gonna be a lot of

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:04.700 
Falls gonna be there's gonna be a lot of
doors<00:05:03.570> and<00:05:03.840> with<00:05:04.050> the<00:05:04.140> developed<00:05:04.530> I'm

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:04.710 
doors and with the developed I'm

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:06.110 
doors and with the developed I'm
actually<00:05:04.950> being<00:05:05.340> increased<00:05:05.730> in<00:05:05.880> this<00:05:05.970> one

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:06.120 
actually being increased in this one

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:07.460 
actually being increased in this one
which<00:05:06.210> I'm<00:05:06.360> actually<00:05:06.510> glad<00:05:06.810> to<00:05:07.050> hear<00:05:07.260> there's

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:07.470 
which I'm actually glad to hear there's

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:09.020 
which I'm actually glad to hear there's
going<00:05:07.590> to<00:05:07.650> be<00:05:07.710> a<00:05:07.920> lot<00:05:08.220> of<00:05:08.250> new<00:05:08.490> things<00:05:08.520> I<00:05:08.820> think

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:09.030 
going to be a lot of new things I think

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:10.640 
going to be a lot of new things I think
we've<00:05:09.180> yet<00:05:09.600> to<00:05:09.660> experience<00:05:10.050> within<00:05:10.380> the<00:05:10.500> five

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:10.650 
we've yet to experience within the five

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:11.690 
we've yet to experience within the five
nights<00:05:10.770> at<00:05:10.950> Freddy's<00:05:11.220> sir

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:11.700 
nights at Freddy's sir

nights at Freddy's sir
games<00:05:12.210> that<00:05:12.390> we've<00:05:12.480> played<00:05:12.660> so<00:05:12.840> far<00:05:13.080> so<00:05:13.560> there

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:13.740 
games that we've played so far so there

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:15.140 
games that we've played so far so there
we<00:05:13.830> go<00:05:13.980> guys<00:05:14.160> there's<00:05:14.460> once<00:05:14.610> again<00:05:14.790> another
