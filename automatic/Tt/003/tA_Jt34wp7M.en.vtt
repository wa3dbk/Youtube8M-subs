but you're going to want to start doing
things<00:00:41.050> they<00:00:41.979> might<00:00:42.159> be<00:00:42.309> a<00:00:42.339> temple<00:00:42.969> run

00:00:44.119 --> 00:00:44.129 
things they might be a temple run

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.540 
things they might be a temple run
repeats<00:00:45.129> or<00:00:45.429> Hill<00:00:45.940> work<00:00:46.179> and<00:00:46.420> so<00:00:46.889> to<00:00:47.889> explain

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:48.550 
repeats or Hill work and so to explain

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:50.309 
repeats or Hill work and so to explain
this<00:00:48.699> a<00:00:48.760> little<00:00:48.879> bit<00:00:49.059> of<00:00:49.179> Temple<00:00:49.510> Run<00:00:49.659> would<00:00:50.170> be

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:50.319 
this a little bit of Temple Run would be

00:00:50.319 --> 00:00:52.379 
this a little bit of Temple Run would be
a<00:00:50.350> run<00:00:50.589> that<00:00:50.799> is<00:00:50.979> an<00:00:51.399> extended<00:00:51.909> period<00:00:52.269> of<00:00:52.329> time

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:52.389 
a run that is an extended period of time

00:00:52.389 --> 00:00:54.270 
a run that is an extended period of time
it<00:00:52.780> might<00:00:52.899> be<00:00:53.049> two<00:00:53.289> miles<00:00:53.499> or<00:00:53.859> three<00:00:54.069> miles

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:54.280 
it might be two miles or three miles

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:57.599 
it might be two miles or three miles
your<00:00:55.089> pace<00:00:55.329> is<00:00:55.600> going<00:00:55.839> to<00:00:55.929> be<00:00:56.079> not<00:00:56.889> race<00:00:57.280> pace

00:00:57.599 --> 00:00:57.609 
your pace is going to be not race pace

00:00:57.609 --> 00:00:59.520 
your pace is going to be not race pace
it's<00:00:58.030> not<00:00:58.179> going<00:00:58.359> to<00:00:58.420> be<00:00:58.539> as<00:00:58.690> fast<00:00:59.019> as<00:00:59.229> you<00:00:59.350> can

00:00:59.520 --> 00:00:59.530 
it's not going to be as fast as you can

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:00.959 
it's not going to be as fast as you can
go<00:00:59.649> but<00:00:59.679> it's<00:00:59.949> going<00:01:00.069> to<00:01:00.159> be<00:01:00.249> faster<00:01:00.699> than<00:01:00.760> if

00:01:00.959 --> 00:01:00.969 
go but it's going to be faster than if

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:02.729 
go but it's going to be faster than if
you<00:01:01.089> would<00:01:01.239> just<00:01:01.329> run<00:01:01.659> two<00:01:01.899> or<00:01:02.019> three<00:01:02.199> miles<00:01:02.409> on

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:02.739 
you would just run two or three miles on

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:04.920 
you would just run two or three miles on
a<00:01:02.799> jog<00:01:03.129> so<00:01:03.729> you<00:01:03.819> want<00:01:03.999> to<00:01:04.059> pick<00:01:04.210> up<00:01:04.239> the<00:01:04.510> pace<00:01:04.720> on

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:04.930 
a jog so you want to pick up the pace on

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:06.570 
a jog so you want to pick up the pace on
these<00:01:05.110> you're<00:01:05.799> going<00:01:05.890> to<00:01:05.950> hurt<00:01:06.159> a<00:01:06.280> little<00:01:06.400> bit

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:06.580 
these you're going to hurt a little bit

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:09.480 
these you're going to hurt a little bit
it's<00:01:06.820> a<00:01:07.030> it's<00:01:07.299> a<00:01:07.420> push<00:01:07.690> through<00:01:08.490> concentrated

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:09.490 
it's a it's a push through concentrated

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:12.000 
it's a it's a push through concentrated
focus<00:01:09.850> effort<00:01:10.240> and<00:01:10.420> it<00:01:10.960> can<00:01:11.110> be<00:01:11.260> it<00:01:11.560> can<00:01:11.620> be<00:01:11.800> up

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:12.010 
focus effort and it can be it can be up

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:13.680 
focus effort and it can be it can be up
to<00:01:12.040> four<00:01:12.400> or<00:01:12.490> five<00:01:12.640> miles<00:01:12.940> if<00:01:13.180> you<00:01:13.210> can<00:01:13.480> but

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:13.690 
to four or five miles if you can but

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:14.940 
to four or five miles if you can but
again<00:01:13.720> it<00:01:13.990> depends<00:01:14.320> on<00:01:14.410> what<00:01:14.560> you're<00:01:14.710> training

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:14.950 
again it depends on what you're training

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.520 
again it depends on what you're training
for<00:01:15.250> and<00:01:15.400> where<00:01:15.520> you're<00:01:15.700> at<00:01:16.320> repeats<00:01:17.320> are

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:17.530 
for and where you're at repeats are

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:19.500 
for and where you're at repeats are
really<00:01:17.830> good<00:01:18.070> you<00:01:18.640> want<00:01:18.820> to<00:01:18.910> go<00:01:19.000> to<00:01:19.060> a<00:01:19.180> track

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:19.510 
really good you want to go to a track

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:21.540 
really good you want to go to a track
maybe<00:01:19.810> for<00:01:20.080> one<00:01:20.230> of<00:01:20.320> these<00:01:20.410> because<00:01:21.370> you're

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:21.550 
maybe for one of these because you're

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:23.730 
maybe for one of these because you're
going<00:01:21.670> to<00:01:21.730> do<00:01:21.850> anything<00:01:22.060> from<00:01:22.480> you<00:01:23.470> could<00:01:23.590> do<00:01:23.710> a

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:23.740 
going to do anything from you could do a

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.350 
going to do anything from you could do a
quarter-mile<00:01:24.310> you<00:01:24.520> could<00:01:24.670> do<00:01:24.760> a<00:01:24.790> half<00:01:25.000> mile<00:01:25.330> or

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:25.360 
quarter-mile you could do a half mile or

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.630 
quarter-mile you could do a half mile or
even<00:01:25.780> a<00:01:25.870> full<00:01:26.110> mile<00:01:26.320> and<00:01:26.890> repeats<00:01:27.310> would<00:01:27.490> be

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:27.640 
even a full mile and repeats would be

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.100 
even a full mile and repeats would be
things<00:01:27.880> where<00:01:28.090> you<00:01:28.210> would<00:01:28.360> you<00:01:28.810> would<00:01:28.960> run

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:29.110 
things where you would you would run

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:30.720 
things where you would you would run
them<00:01:29.290> pretty<00:01:29.710> hard<00:01:29.950> you're<00:01:30.250> going<00:01:30.340> to<00:01:30.400> want<00:01:30.640> to

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:30.730 
them pretty hard you're going to want to

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:32.730 
them pretty hard you're going to want to
run<00:01:30.880> these<00:01:31.120> you<00:01:31.810> know<00:01:31.900> eighty<00:01:32.110> ninety<00:01:32.530> percent

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:32.740 
run these you know eighty ninety percent

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.010 
run these you know eighty ninety percent
what<00:01:33.490> that<00:01:33.700> really<00:01:33.910> means<00:01:34.150> is<00:01:34.420> is<00:01:34.660> when<00:01:34.930> you

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.020 
what that really means is is when you

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:36.870 
what that really means is is when you
get<00:01:35.110> done<00:01:35.350> you're<00:01:35.530> breathing<00:01:35.890> hard<00:01:36.130> and<00:01:36.400> heavy

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:36.880 
get done you're breathing hard and heavy

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.490 
get done you're breathing hard and heavy
but<00:01:37.360> you<00:01:37.510> get<00:01:37.630> a<00:01:37.660> rest<00:01:37.960> so<00:01:38.230> you're<00:01:38.350> going<00:01:38.470> to

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:38.500 
but you get a rest so you're going to

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.500 
but you get a rest so you're going to
take<00:01:38.740> 60<00:01:39.160> seconds<00:01:39.670> you<00:01:39.850> could<00:01:39.940> even<00:01:40.120> take<00:01:40.300> two

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:40.510 
take 60 seconds you could even take two

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:42.510 
take 60 seconds you could even take two
minutes<00:01:40.840> or<00:01:41.020> three<00:01:41.050> minutes<00:01:41.530> you<00:01:42.040> want<00:01:42.160> to<00:01:42.310> you

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:42.520 
minutes or three minutes you want to you

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.730 
minutes or three minutes you want to you
want<00:01:42.670> to<00:01:42.730> reset<00:01:43.090> catch<00:01:43.930> your<00:01:44.110> breath<00:01:44.260> and<00:01:44.560> then

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:44.740 
want to reset catch your breath and then

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:45.720 
want to reset catch your breath and then
you're<00:01:44.830> going<00:01:44.920> to<00:01:44.980> do<00:01:45.100> it<00:01:45.190> again<00:01:45.280> and<00:01:45.670> you

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:45.730 
you're going to do it again and you

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:47.310 
you're going to do it again and you
might<00:01:45.880> do<00:01:46.090> these<00:01:46.270> three<00:01:46.570> or<00:01:46.720> four<00:01:46.960> or<00:01:47.110> five

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:47.320 
might do these three or four or five

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.680 
might do these three or four or five
times<00:01:47.650> over<00:01:47.909> go<00:01:48.909> to<00:01:48.970> the<00:01:49.090> track<00:01:49.360> you<00:01:49.540> can

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:49.690 
times over go to the track you can

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:51.570 
times over go to the track you can
experiment<00:01:50.080> with<00:01:50.320> them<00:01:50.620> if<00:01:50.800> you're<00:01:51.310> training

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:51.580 
experiment with them if you're training

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.360 
experiment with them if you're training
for<00:01:51.730> a<00:01:51.909> shorter<00:01:52.330> race<00:01:52.540> of<00:01:52.930> 400<00:01:53.530> you<00:01:54.010> know<00:01:54.040> one

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:54.370 
for a shorter race of 400 you know one

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:55.560 
for a shorter race of 400 you know one
time<00:01:54.580> or<00:01:54.790> two<00:01:54.909> times<00:01:55.090> around<00:01:55.330> the<00:01:55.540> track

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:55.570 
time or two times around the track

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:58.080 
time or two times around the track
quarter<00:01:56.560> mile<00:01:56.740> or<00:01:56.920> half<00:01:56.950> mile<00:01:57.370> repeats<00:01:57.610> those

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:58.090 
quarter mile or half mile repeats those

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:59.910 
quarter mile or half mile repeats those
are<00:01:58.240> fine<00:01:58.450> if<00:01:58.720> you're<00:01:59.200> training<00:01:59.409> for<00:01:59.530> longer

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 
are fine if you're training for longer

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.920 
are fine if you're training for longer
distances<00:02:00.370> you<00:02:00.520> might<00:02:00.700> want<00:02:00.880> to<00:02:00.940> do<00:02:01.120> a<00:02:01.330> full

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:01.930 
distances you might want to do a full

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:04.320 
distances you might want to do a full
mile<00:02:02.170> repeating<00:02:02.830> and<00:02:03.010> again<00:02:03.520> do<00:02:03.729> them<00:02:03.940> over

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.330 
mile repeating and again do them over

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:05.640 
mile repeating and again do them over
and<00:02:04.450> over<00:02:04.659> again<00:02:04.750> with<00:02:05.080> a<00:02:05.110> break<00:02:05.380> in<00:02:05.409> the

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:05.650 
and over again with a break in the

00:02:05.650 --> 00:02:08.669 
and over again with a break in the
middle<00:02:06.270> these<00:02:07.270> are<00:02:07.330> by<00:02:08.019> the<00:02:08.050> time<00:02:08.319> you<00:02:08.470> get<00:02:08.590> to

00:02:08.669 --> 00:02:08.679 
middle these are by the time you get to

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:09.749 
middle these are by the time you get to
the<00:02:08.800> end<00:02:08.950> you're<00:02:09.129> going<00:02:09.159> to<00:02:09.280> be<00:02:09.429> you're<00:02:09.729> going

to be done you're going to be really
