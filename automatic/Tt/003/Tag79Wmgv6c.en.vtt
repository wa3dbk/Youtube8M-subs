00:01:59.150 --> 00:01:59.160 
twist style of shutoff so if you do

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:00.770 
twist style of shutoff so if you do
break<00:01:59.429> and<00:01:59.610> extend<00:02:00.000> it<00:02:00.179> still<00:02:00.420> gives<00:02:00.569> you<00:02:00.720> the

break and extend it still gives you the

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.630 
break and extend it still gives you the

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
then we also have a foam attachment both

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.870 
then we also have a foam attachment both
