important<00:02:12.890> to<00:02:12.980> us<00:02:13.130> is<00:02:13.340> that<00:02:13.370> we<00:02:13.520> get<00:02:13.790> the

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:13.970 
important to us is that we get the

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.260 
important to us is that we get the
information<00:02:14.000> presented<00:02:14.780> by<00:02:15.170> experts<00:02:15.680> and<00:02:16.270> we

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
information presented by experts and we

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.000 
information presented by experts and we
get<00:02:17.420> it<00:02:17.510> out<00:02:17.630> in<00:02:17.720> mainstream<00:02:17.959> media<00:02:18.260> and<00:02:18.860> by

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:19.010 
get it out in mainstream media and by

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.100 
get it out in mainstream media and by
doing<00:02:19.459> that<00:02:19.670> yeah<00:02:19.880> I<00:02:20.060> think<00:02:20.480> it<00:02:20.750> gives<00:02:20.900> a<00:02:20.959> lot

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
doing that yeah I think it gives a lot

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:23.199 
doing that yeah I think it gives a lot
more<00:02:21.200> credibility<00:02:21.860> to<00:02:22.160> the<00:02:22.370> material<00:02:22.849> and<00:02:23.090> it

00:02:23.199 --> 00:02:23.209 
more credibility to the material and it

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:25.750 
more credibility to the material and it
makes<00:02:23.360> it<00:02:23.480> a<00:02:23.510> lot<00:02:23.599> more<00:02:23.690> accessible<00:02:24.650> I<00:02:24.980> think

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
makes it a lot more accessible I think

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.510 
makes it a lot more accessible I think
for<00:02:25.940> the<00:02:26.510> pet<00:02:26.900> owner<00:02:27.080> puts<00:02:28.040> it<00:02:28.129> all<00:02:28.280> in<00:02:28.430> one

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.729 
makes it exciting for us is is that one
of<00:02:59.909> the<00:02:59.969> main<00:03:00.120> reasons<00:03:00.510> why<00:03:00.659> dogs<00:03:00.930> naturally

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 
of the main reasons why dogs naturally

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:04.399 
of the main reasons why dogs naturally
is<00:03:01.859> here<00:03:02.250> is<00:03:02.670> because<00:03:03.049> other<00:03:04.049> people<00:03:04.379> might

00:03:04.399 --> 00:03:04.409 
is here is because other people might

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:06.830 
is here is because other people might
not<00:03:04.709> share<00:03:05.250> sentiment<00:03:05.969> but<00:03:06.299> we<00:03:06.480> believe<00:03:06.810> that

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
not share sentiment but we believe that

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:08.659 
not share sentiment but we believe that
dogs<00:03:07.200> are<00:03:07.379> being<00:03:07.620> over<00:03:07.889> serviced<00:03:08.340> right<00:03:08.519> now

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:08.669 
dogs are being over serviced right now

00:03:08.669 --> 00:03:11.059 
dogs are being over serviced right now
by<00:03:08.819> the<00:03:08.879> vaccine<00:03:09.359> industry<00:03:09.769> we<00:03:10.769> just<00:03:10.950> think

00:03:11.059 --> 00:03:11.069 
by the vaccine industry we just think

00:03:11.069 --> 00:03:12.319 
by the vaccine industry we just think
that<00:03:11.250> things<00:03:11.459> need<00:03:11.609> to<00:03:11.639> be<00:03:11.730> scaled<00:03:12.060> back<00:03:12.269> a

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:12.329 
that things need to be scaled back a

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:13.520 
that things need to be scaled back a
little<00:03:12.599> bit<00:03:12.780> there's<00:03:13.139> a<00:03:13.200> few<00:03:13.379> too<00:03:13.500> many

unnecessary vaccinations and if you take

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:04.039 
unnecessary vaccinations and if you take
a<00:04:02.220> good<00:04:02.489> look<00:04:02.759> a<00:04:02.909> lot<00:04:03.150> of<00:04:03.180> vaccination<00:04:03.930> today

00:04:04.039 --> 00:04:04.049 
a good look a lot of vaccination today

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:05.509 
a good look a lot of vaccination today
is<00:04:04.439> unnecessary

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:05.519 
is unnecessary

00:04:05.519 --> 00:04:07.670 
is unnecessary
number<00:04:06.120> two<00:04:06.359> is<00:04:06.659> definitely<00:04:06.989> feeding<00:04:07.620> a

number one if you can is get away from

00:04:14.069 --> 00:04:15.860 
number one if you can is get away from
kibble<00:04:14.579> the<00:04:14.879> next<00:04:15.150> step<00:04:15.299> if<00:04:15.449> you<00:04:15.479> want<00:04:15.569> to<00:04:15.780> go

to a dehydrated or a freeze-dried food
that's<00:04:18.930> okay<00:04:19.289> but<00:04:19.680> the<00:04:19.769> closer<00:04:20.009> that<00:04:20.159> you<00:04:20.400> can

00:04:20.599 --> 00:04:20.609 
that's okay but the closer that you can

00:04:20.609 --> 00:04:23.390 
that's okay but the closer that you can

synthetic vitamins and minerals in them

00:04:25.349 --> 00:04:27.770 
synthetic vitamins and minerals in them
you<00:04:25.919> know<00:04:26.039> the<00:04:26.820> better<00:04:27.000> off<00:04:27.060> you'll<00:04:27.360> be<00:04:27.389> and

you know the better off you'll be and

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:29.629 
you know the better off you'll be and
number<00:04:28.199> three<00:04:28.560> the<00:04:28.800> big<00:04:28.949> one<00:04:29.130> is<00:04:29.430> just

00:04:29.629 --> 00:04:29.639 
number three the big one is just

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:31.459 
number three the big one is just
avoiding<00:04:30.030> chemicals<00:04:30.509> and<00:04:30.659> toxins<00:04:31.199> you<00:04:31.380> know

00:04:31.459 --> 00:04:31.469 
avoiding chemicals and toxins you know

00:04:31.469 --> 00:04:34.100 
avoiding chemicals and toxins you know
really<00:04:32.039> question<00:04:32.699> whether<00:04:32.940> that<00:04:33.360> heartworm

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:34.110 
really question whether that heartworm

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:36.170 
really question whether that heartworm
medication<00:04:34.889> is<00:04:35.009> necessary<00:04:35.490> based<00:04:35.789> on<00:04:35.969> where

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:36.180 
medication is necessary based on where

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:38.470 
medication is necessary based on where
you<00:04:36.300> live<00:04:36.570> and<00:04:37.259> based<00:04:37.560> on<00:04:37.710> the<00:04:37.830> testing

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:38.480 
you live and based on the testing

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:40.870 
you live and based on the testing
you<00:04:38.630> could<00:04:38.810> be<00:04:38.930> doing<00:04:39.710> to<00:04:39.740> maybe<00:04:40.010> replace<00:04:40.370> it<00:04:40.730> I

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:40.880 
you could be doing to maybe replace it I

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:42.880 
you could be doing to maybe replace it I
think<00:04:41.330> people<00:04:41.570> just<00:04:41.600> they<00:04:42.170> just<00:04:42.200> do<00:04:42.650> this

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:42.890 
think people just they just do this

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:44.950 
think people just they just do this
without<00:04:43.790> thinking<00:04:44.330> and<00:04:44.480> it's<00:04:44.600> time<00:04:44.720> to<00:04:44.810> just

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:44.960 
without thinking and it's time to just

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:46.480 
without thinking and it's time to just
take<00:04:45.050> a<00:04:45.110> step<00:04:45.410> back<00:04:45.650> and<00:04:45.890> really<00:04:46.040> question

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:46.490 
take a step back and really question

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:48.010 
take a step back and really question
what<00:04:46.910> this<00:04:47.030> is<00:04:47.150> doing<00:04:47.330> to<00:04:47.450> our<00:04:47.540> dog's<00:04:47.780> health

00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:48.020 
what this is doing to our dog's health

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:49.660 
what this is doing to our dog's health
well<00:04:48.740> I<00:04:48.770> think<00:04:48.950> one<00:04:49.160> of<00:04:49.190> the<00:04:49.310> great<00:04:49.460> things

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:49.670 
well I think one of the great things

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:51.070 
well I think one of the great things
that<00:04:49.760> your<00:04:49.970> magazine<00:04:50.360> does<00:04:50.570> is<00:04:50.780> it<00:04:50.900> does

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:51.080 
that your magazine does is it does

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:53.230 
that your magazine does is it does
educate<00:04:51.800> do<00:04:52.370> you<00:04:52.460> think<00:04:52.700> there's<00:04:52.850> a<00:04:52.940> lack<00:04:53.210> of

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:53.240 
educate do you think there's a lack of

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:55.210 
educate do you think there's a lack of
education<00:04:53.570> out<00:04:54.290> there<00:04:54.500> for<00:04:54.680> pet<00:04:54.830> parents<00:04:55.130> and

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:55.220 
education out there for pet parents and

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:56.760 
education out there for pet parents and
that's<00:04:55.370> why<00:04:55.700> we've<00:04:56.000> kind<00:04:56.270> of<00:04:56.330> all<00:04:56.510> been

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:56.770 
that's why we've kind of all been

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:01.180 
that's why we've kind of all been
programmed<00:04:57.770> into<00:04:58.070> this<00:04:58.720> lack<00:04:59.720> of<00:05:00.190> maybe

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:01.190 
programmed into this lack of maybe

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:03.520 
programmed into this lack of maybe
taking<00:05:01.580> those<00:05:01.700> necessary<00:05:02.540> steps<00:05:02.900> for<00:05:03.170> our

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:03.530 
taking those necessary steps for our

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:06.340 
taking those necessary steps for our
pets<00:05:04.130> animal<00:05:04.490> illness<00:05:04.790> I<00:05:05.260> think<00:05:06.260> the

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:06.350 
pets animal illness I think the

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:08.200 
pets animal illness I think the
education<00:05:06.980> is<00:05:07.100> there<00:05:07.280> I<00:05:07.310> think<00:05:07.490> the<00:05:07.730> problem

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:08.210 
education is there I think the problem

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:10.870 
education is there I think the problem
is<00:05:08.420> is<00:05:08.750> that<00:05:09.110> it<00:05:09.920> requires<00:05:10.220> a<00:05:10.400> paradigm<00:05:10.850> shift

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:10.880 
is is that it requires a paradigm shift

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:12.940 
is is that it requires a paradigm shift
because<00:05:11.360> there's<00:05:12.260> there's<00:05:12.560> definitely

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:12.950 
because there's there's definitely

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:14.440 
because there's there's definitely
there's<00:05:13.070> two<00:05:13.310> ends<00:05:13.610> there's<00:05:13.760> a<00:05:13.820> conventional

00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:14.450 
there's two ends there's a conventional

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:16.030 
there's two ends there's a conventional
medical<00:05:14.840> model<00:05:15.170> and<00:05:15.320> there's<00:05:15.650> a<00:05:15.710> holistic

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:16.040 
medical model and there's a holistic

00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:17.650 
medical model and there's a holistic
medical<00:05:16.640> model<00:05:16.940> there's<00:05:17.210> everything<00:05:17.450> in

00:05:17.650 --> 00:05:17.660 
medical model there's everything in

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:18.160 
medical model there's everything in
between

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:18.170 
between

00:05:18.170 --> 00:05:20.290 
between
and<00:05:18.590> that<00:05:18.830> leaves<00:05:19.130> a<00:05:19.370> lot<00:05:19.400> of<00:05:19.670> room<00:05:20.030> for

00:05:20.290 --> 00:05:20.300 
and that leaves a lot of room for

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:22.660 
and that leaves a lot of room for
confusion<00:05:20.480> for<00:05:21.470> the<00:05:21.560> pet<00:05:21.770> owner<00:05:21.950> I<00:05:22.250> think<00:05:22.610> a

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:22.670 
confusion for the pet owner I think a

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:24.100 
confusion for the pet owner I think a
lot<00:05:22.850> of<00:05:22.970> them<00:05:23.060> want<00:05:23.300> to<00:05:23.420> move<00:05:23.600> to<00:05:23.720> holistic

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:24.110 
lot of them want to move to holistic

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:26.140 
lot of them want to move to holistic
medicine<00:05:24.560> and<00:05:24.770> the<00:05:24.830> tools<00:05:25.100> I<00:05:25.310> think<00:05:25.670> are<00:05:26.000> there

00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:26.150 
medicine and the tools I think are there

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:28.390 
medicine and the tools I think are there
for<00:05:26.330> them<00:05:26.420> to<00:05:26.540> do<00:05:26.720> that<00:05:26.750> but<00:05:27.590> there's<00:05:27.800> a<00:05:27.860> lot<00:05:28.220> of

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:28.400 
for them to do that but there's a lot of

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:30.220 
for them to do that but there's a lot of
pressure<00:05:28.790> for<00:05:29.150> them<00:05:29.270> to<00:05:29.450> fall<00:05:29.960> back<00:05:30.200> to

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:30.230 
pressure for them to fall back to

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:31.960 
pressure for them to fall back to
conventional<00:05:30.920> medicine<00:05:30.950> all<00:05:31.460> the<00:05:31.580> time<00:05:31.730> and

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:31.970 
conventional medicine all the time and

00:05:31.970 --> 00:05:33.580 
conventional medicine all the time and
there's<00:05:32.240> the<00:05:32.360> fear<00:05:32.630> basis<00:05:33.050> too<00:05:33.230> because<00:05:33.470> a<00:05:33.500> lot

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:33.590 
there's the fear basis too because a lot

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:35.530 
there's the fear basis too because a lot
of<00:05:33.800> what<00:05:34.190> drives<00:05:34.460> conventional<00:05:35.030> medicine<00:05:35.450> is

00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:35.540 
of what drives conventional medicine is
