00:00:17.489 --> 00:00:24.520
 Hello Mr. Stone instead of one 

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:27.489
 tournee winner stefan universe im 

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:34.570
 cockpit or while the account has the 

00:00:27.489 --> 00:00:35.800
 dokuwerk nature it looks like with the 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:40.300
 car special points 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:41.860
 what it considers important is turned on 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:45.160
 also in the front lock on the 

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:46.500
 lowest value very important to the internist 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:50.890
 approach 

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:53.559
 so that's new turn and then it is 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:56.140
 important the goal is to focus 

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:59.050
 not very focused funds 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:02.460
 plugged and then by the climate there 

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:06.520
 from june first sip or power 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:10.229
 is doing so are efficient and 

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:10.229
 comes on foot and body 

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:17.040
 important also the kick of the clips 

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:21.240
 upper body so right 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:26.340
 then out again or the location 

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:28.310
 for more nights Nicolas super girlfriend 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.980
 for the spinning optics is actually 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:35.220
 that means now only the war 

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:40.410
 turns and I really wake up 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:42.450
 the knee joints of the course that is 

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:47.040
 to look really fast and dynamic 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:49.380
 is another variation of the tricking 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:53.370
 is used 

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:56.040
 This emerged after where precisely because he 

00:01:53.370 --> 00:01:58.290
 has proven a lost behind 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.600
 stopover in living longer 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.640
 generate and then kick served 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.619
 actually generate momentum 

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:06.979
 where you then subsequent technology 

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.979
 do 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.700
 important for all means want now 

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.650
 in the trekking or you click 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:39.140
 at all that is the technique 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:41.569
 do it slowly first and then look 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.310
 that the technology is really clean, the 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:45.680
 Technically clean and warded keeper 

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:46.880
 automatically more so first on the 

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:49.280
 focus on technology 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:52.180
 relax relaxed and then work 

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:52.180
 to go on speed
