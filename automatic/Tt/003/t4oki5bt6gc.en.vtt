00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
wherever I go next and I think that

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.030

that's really the mark of an excellent

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.469 
that's really the mark of an excellent
institution<00:01:32.250> is<00:01:32.640> when<00:01:32.790> you<00:01:32.880> were<00:01:33.000> prepared

institution is when you were prepared

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:36.200 
institution is when you were prepared
for<00:01:34.409> a<00:01:34.799> myriad<00:01:35.640> of<00:01:35.759> different<00:01:35.880> opportunities

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
for a myriad of different opportunities

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:37.760 
for a myriad of different opportunities
a<00:01:36.509> myriad<00:01:36.750> of<00:01:36.810> different<00:01:36.900> experiences<00:01:37.560> and<00:01:37.710> so

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
a myriad of different experiences and so

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.410 
a myriad of different experiences and so
I<00:01:37.799> feel<00:01:38.040> that<00:01:38.159> that's<00:01:38.280> what<00:01:38.549> Mount<00:01:39.060> Sinai<00:01:39.240> has

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
I feel that that's what Mount Sinai has

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.410 
I feel that that's what Mount Sinai has
given<00:01:39.750> me<00:01:39.900> and<00:01:40.049> so<00:01:40.140> I<00:01:40.170> think<00:01:40.500> in<00:01:41.070> terms<00:01:41.790> of<00:01:42.090> if<00:01:42.329> I

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:42.420 
given me and so I think in terms of if I

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:44.330 
given me and so I think in terms of if I
go<00:01:42.540> to<00:01:42.600> medical<00:01:42.930> school<00:01:42.990> my<00:01:43.799> public<00:01:44.159> health

go to medical school my public health
knowledge<00:01:45.030> I<00:01:45.479> think<00:01:45.750> will<00:01:45.869> be<00:01:45.960> extremely

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229 
knowledge I think will be extremely

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.130 
knowledge I think will be extremely
advantageous<00:01:46.740> into<00:01:47.430> the<00:01:47.549> way<00:01:47.790> that<00:01:48.509> I<00:01:48.540> learn

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:49.140 
advantageous into the way that I learn

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.840 
advantageous into the way that I learn

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
place for an education New York just

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.260 
place for an education New York just
because<00:02:25.770> there<00:02:25.920> is<00:02:26.100> so<00:02:26.430> much<00:02:26.700> at<00:02:26.940> an
