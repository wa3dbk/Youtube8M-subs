videos<00:02:03.399> like<00:02:03.640> Linus<00:02:04.030> tech<00:02:04.270> tips<00:02:04.600> and<00:02:05.040> Jase<00:02:06.040> you

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250 
videos like Linus tech tips and Jase you

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:07.710 
videos like Linus tech tips and Jase you
sense<00:02:06.549> the<00:02:06.759> tech<00:02:06.939> of<00:02:07.060> tomorrow<00:02:07.390> tech

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:07.720 
sense the tech of tomorrow tech

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.529 
sense the tech of tomorrow tech
syndicate<00:02:08.289> these<00:02:08.770> are<00:02:08.979> my<00:02:09.539> technological

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:10.539 
syndicate these are my technological

00:02:10.539 --> 00:02:12.390 
syndicate these are my technological
education<00:02:11.290> videos<00:02:11.739> where<00:02:12.069> I<00:02:12.099> get<00:02:12.310> my

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
education videos where I get my

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.370 
education videos where I get my
information<00:02:12.580> on<00:02:13.120> it<00:02:13.239> from<00:02:13.390> yeah<00:02:13.930> there's

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
information on it from yeah there's

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.949 
information on it from yeah there's
other<00:02:14.560> things<00:02:14.680> like<00:02:15.040> NCIX<00:02:15.819> hardware<00:02:16.569> canucks

00:02:16.949 --> 00:02:16.959 
other things like NCIX hardware canucks

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:19.050 
other things like NCIX hardware canucks
things<00:02:17.349> like<00:02:17.530> that<00:02:17.709> and<00:02:18.040> those<00:02:18.760> are<00:02:18.819> good

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:19.060 
things like that and those are good

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:20.580 
things like that and those are good
sources<00:02:19.300> of<00:02:19.540> information<00:02:19.720> also

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590 
sources of information also

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:22.979 
sources of information also
but<00:02:20.980> generally<00:02:21.400> speaking<00:02:21.700> these<00:02:22.000> videos<00:02:22.599> are

00:02:22.979 --> 00:02:22.989 
but generally speaking these videos are

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:26.640 
but generally speaking these videos are
long<00:02:23.830> they<00:02:24.640> are<00:02:24.670> long<00:02:25.269> sometimes<00:02:26.019> painfully

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:26.650 
long they are long sometimes painfully

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:27.089 
long they are long sometimes painfully
so

00:02:27.089 --> 00:02:27.099 
so

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:29.490 
so
podcasts<00:02:28.090> are<00:02:28.209> very<00:02:28.450> informative<00:02:29.080> and<00:02:29.410> very

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
podcasts are very informative and very

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.430 
podcasts are very informative and very
lengthy<00:02:30.310> and<00:02:30.640> I<00:02:30.730> think<00:02:30.970> to<00:02:31.060> myself<00:02:31.260> what<00:02:32.260> if

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:32.440 
lengthy and I think to myself what if

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.130 
lengthy and I think to myself what if
instead<00:02:33.040> of<00:02:33.100> being<00:02:33.549> a<00:02:33.790> long<00:02:33.970> video<00:02:34.330> where<00:02:34.959> they

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:35.140 
instead of being a long video where they

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.050 
instead of being a long video where they
reviewed<00:02:35.590> the<00:02:35.680> product<00:02:35.920> in<00:02:36.280> depth<00:02:36.549> and<00:02:36.760> told

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:37.060 
reviewed the product in depth and told

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:39.900 
reviewed the product in depth and told
you<00:02:37.239> the<00:02:37.390> ups<00:02:37.540> and<00:02:37.690> downs<00:02:37.780> to<00:02:38.290> it<00:02:38.440> if<00:02:39.400> it<00:02:39.610> was<00:02:39.760> a

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:39.910 
you the ups and downs to it if it was a

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.270 
you the ups and downs to it if it was a
one-minute<00:02:40.569> review<00:02:40.959> or<00:02:41.380> it<00:02:41.650> was<00:02:41.799> much<00:02:42.069> much

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
one-minute review or it was much much

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.990 
one-minute review or it was much much
shorter<00:02:42.819> just<00:02:43.090> to<00:02:43.239> retain<00:02:43.660> the<00:02:43.870> audience<00:02:44.380> as<00:02:44.680> a

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
shorter just to retain the audience as a

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.880 
shorter just to retain the audience as a
participation<00:02:46.319> awareness<00:02:47.319> and<00:02:47.560> things<00:02:47.739> like

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:47.890 
participation awareness and things like

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:50.070 
participation awareness and things like
that<00:02:47.950> it<00:02:48.580> kind<00:02:48.850> of<00:02:48.940> makes<00:02:49.120> me<00:02:49.209> think<00:02:49.330> of<00:02:49.780> what

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:50.080 
that it kind of makes me think of what

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:52.170 
that it kind of makes me think of what
exactly<00:02:50.650> would<00:02:51.010> happen<00:02:51.459> what<00:02:51.790> would<00:02:52.000> become

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
exactly would happen what would become

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:56.250 
exactly would happen what would become
of<00:02:53.250> people<00:02:54.250> if<00:02:54.430> more<00:02:54.970> streamline<00:02:55.540> youtubers

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:56.260 
of people if more streamline youtubers

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.670 
of people if more streamline youtubers
did<00:02:56.500> this<00:02:56.709> and<00:02:57.000> it<00:02:58.000> doesn't<00:02:58.569> keep<00:02:58.900> me<00:02:58.959> awake<00:02:59.470> at

00:02:59.670 --> 00:02:59.680 
did this and it doesn't keep me awake at

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.310 
did this and it doesn't keep me awake at
night<00:02:59.709> it's<00:03:00.160> just<00:03:00.430> a<00:03:00.610> curious<00:03:01.030> question<00:03:01.359> that

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:02.320 
night it's just a curious question that

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.770 
night it's just a curious question that
I've<00:03:02.500> always<00:03:02.769> asked<00:03:03.310> myself<00:03:03.459> yeah<00:03:04.239> I<00:03:04.269> kind<00:03:04.630> of

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
I've always asked myself yeah I kind of

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:07.190 
I've always asked myself yeah I kind of
wonder<00:03:05.109> where<00:03:05.350> is<00:03:05.470> the<00:03:05.620> sweet<00:03:05.980> spot<00:03:06.190> for

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
wonder where is the sweet spot for

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.960 
wonder where is the sweet spot for
education<00:03:08.200> I've<00:03:08.560> kind<00:03:09.040> of<00:03:09.160> always<00:03:09.400> leaned

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:09.970 
education I've kind of always leaned

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.180 
education I've kind of always leaned
towards<00:03:10.359> wanting<00:03:10.720> to<00:03:10.840> become<00:03:11.109> a<00:03:11.140> teacher<00:03:11.410> but

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
towards wanting to become a teacher but

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:14.880 
towards wanting to become a teacher but
with<00:03:12.400> how<00:03:12.850> things<00:03:13.390> go<00:03:13.780> and<00:03:14.290> things<00:03:14.500> like<00:03:14.709> that

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:14.890

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:20.530 
of feel that that might not be the best

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.420 
of feel that that might not be the best
