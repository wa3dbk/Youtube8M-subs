00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:12.890
 Today we are going to teach you how to release a 

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:14.960
 blackberry 9300 operator orange on 

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:17.350
 first place they have to turn on the 

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:21.410
 phone without any card is imposed 

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:23.830
 second they have to go to the menu and 

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:23.830
 search for 

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:33.439
 and look for the spanner that are 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:33.439

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:41.710
 within the device configuration of the 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.710
 advanced system 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.420
 and now sim card 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.800

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:00.800
