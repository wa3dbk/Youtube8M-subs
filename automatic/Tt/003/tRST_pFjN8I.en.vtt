00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.770
 yes 

00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:08.720
 very good friends this is a plane of a 

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:12.110
 power source for a car radio 

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:15.470
 first of all let's start from the 

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:18.730
 entrance that is attention the entrance 

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:21.689
 current attention 

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:26.830
 that we have from this outlet 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:30.070
 we have and we see here we have put 

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:33.460
 possible in the entry to protect and 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:37.540
 a switch to turn off and turn on the 

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:40.600
 people then we have here current 

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:44.190
 alternate 220 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:46.260
 a 4 amp transformer 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:49.760
 Y 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.600
 then we have another coil in the output 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.530
 secondary 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:59.239
 It is a full band transformer 

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.239
 pulling out of the center 

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:09.090
 a negative point a center point or 

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:12.799
 neutral of the two extremes we have 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.799
 the voltages of 12 volts 

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:21.700
 and then we have here the diodes these two 

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:23.760
 are those that are going to rectify the 

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:25.560
 alternating current 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:29.400
 from alternating current to current 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:32.550
 then continue from the diode in 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:36.710
 forward we already have current 

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:42.350
 and rectified the current is continuous 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:46.040
 then here and we have ratified and 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:50.229
 then we also have the capacitor or 

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.229
 the filter that will filter that current 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:58.409
 since the diodes have rectified 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:02:02.000
 then from this point I 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:07.140
 We have purified direct current 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.789
 for our car radio a voltage of 12 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.780
 volts 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:16.799
 that will serve to make work a 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:19.920
 team one a car radio or any 

00:02:16.799 --> 00:02:22.550
 another device that works with this 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:26.840
 12 volt voltage 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:29.780
 so it is important to know the 

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:32.730
 functions of each of them because of 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:37.310
 this way we are going to realize 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:42.150
 we are doing and how are we going to use it 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:46.470
 then first we have fuse of 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:50.930
 entry we have a switch or a 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:54.549
 switch off for the source 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:03:01.010
 when this is paid, there is no longer 

00:02:54.549 --> 00:03:03.609
 current and then we have and here in the 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:07.909
 output also another switch for 

00:03:03.609 --> 00:03:10.760
 feed the output and we have put 

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:14.530
 just in case a fuse also to the 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:16.840
 exit for any problem 

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:20.510
 to a short that there could be in 

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:23.850
 the team or another 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:26.940
 moments suddenly these two peoples are 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:29.220
 hit that was going to happen this motive is going 

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:33.000
 to burn then it automatically goes to 

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:36.030
 protect your equipment and also the source 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:39.990
 this fine chain output we have a 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:41.790
 switch to protect the entire source of 

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:45.240
 power then friends 

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:48.390
 this is a simple diagram a diagram 

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:52.280
 that you can use yourself can do 

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:56.440
 at home in your home and you can 

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:59.440
 practice and you can do it and use 

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:59.440
 so 

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:07.380
 how is 2013 thanks 

00:04:04.819 --> 00:04:09.730
 and I invite you too 

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:15.230
 to participate 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:17.650
 reporting giving some concern or 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:17.650
 any 

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:24.260
 need they want to report will be 

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:24.260
 until next time
