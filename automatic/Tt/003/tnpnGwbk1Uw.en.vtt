hi Davey again from Big Bite matcom

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:15.199 
hi Davey again from Big Bite matcom
today<00:00:13.860> we're<00:00:14.280> going<00:00:14.430> to<00:00:14.580> be<00:00:14.670> changing<00:00:15.119> the

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:15.209 
today we're going to be changing the

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:17.929 
today we're going to be changing the
spark<00:00:15.450> plugs<00:00:15.840> on<00:00:16.139> project<00:00:17.040> bike<00:00:17.220> the<00:00:17.490> Triumph

00:00:17.929 --> 00:00:17.939 
spark plugs on project bike the Triumph

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:20.900 
spark plugs on project bike the Triumph
Rocket<00:00:18.300> 3<00:00:18.570> we're<00:00:19.050> going<00:00:19.200> to<00:00:19.290> be<00:00:19.349> using<00:00:19.910> these

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
Rocket 3 we're going to be using these

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:24.710 
Rocket 3 we're going to be using these
which<00:00:21.419> are<00:00:21.689> NGK<00:00:22.560> Iridium<00:00:22.770> plugs<00:00:23.570> not<00:00:24.570> the

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:24.720 
which are NGK Iridium plugs not the

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:26.330 
which are NGK Iridium plugs not the
standard<00:00:25.079> plug<00:00:25.320> but<00:00:25.649> we've<00:00:25.860> had<00:00:26.009> good<00:00:26.160> results

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
standard plug but we've had good results

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.069 
standard plug but we've had good results
with<00:00:26.700> the<00:00:26.790> yridians<00:00:27.090> before<00:00:27.540> now

00:00:28.069 --> 00:00:28.079 
with the yridians before now

00:00:28.079 --> 00:00:32.569 
with the yridians before now
interestingly<00:00:29.899> the<00:00:30.899> spark<00:00:31.230> plug<00:00:31.469> change<00:00:32.189> is

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
interestingly the spark plug change is

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.720 
interestingly the spark plug change is
not<00:00:33.210> something<00:00:33.480> that<00:00:33.899> is<00:00:34.050> covered<00:00:34.469> by<00:00:34.649> the

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:34.730 
not something that is covered by the

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.880 
not something that is covered by the
official<00:00:35.730> workshop<00:00:36.120> manual<00:00:36.559> first<00:00:37.559> time<00:00:37.739> I've

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
ever known that of any bike and that

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.099 
ever known that of any bike and that
operation<00:00:41.489> normally<00:00:42.300> is<00:00:42.420> in<00:00:42.600> there<00:00:42.749> somewhere

00:00:43.099 --> 00:00:43.109 
operation normally is in there somewhere

00:00:43.109 --> 00:00:45.470 
operation normally is in there somewhere
but<00:00:43.289> it<00:00:43.410> isn't<00:00:43.739> in<00:00:43.859> the<00:00:43.890> rocketry<00:00:44.489> service

the left side cover here and we found
that<00:01:27.580> you<00:01:27.760> can<00:01:28.000> just<00:01:28.270> undo<00:01:28.510> the<00:01:28.660> bolt<00:01:28.870> at<00:01:29.320> the

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:29.350 
that you can just undo the bolt at the

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.380 
that you can just undo the bolt at the
back<00:01:29.560> of<00:01:29.590> the<00:01:29.860> tank<00:01:30.100> and<00:01:30.460> if<00:01:31.450> you<00:01:32.220> disconnect

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
back of the tank and if you disconnect

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:36.510 
back of the tank and if you disconnect
these<00:01:34.390> which<00:01:34.720> are<00:01:34.900> the<00:01:35.050> breather<00:01:35.290> hoses<00:01:35.530> and

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:36.520 
these which are the breather hoses and

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.620 
these which are the breather hoses and
one<00:01:37.420> goes<00:01:37.660> on<00:01:38.380> to<00:01:38.590> little<00:01:39.070> gubbins<00:01:39.400> here<00:01:40.390> and

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:40.630 
one goes on to little gubbins here and

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.080 
one goes on to little gubbins here and
this<00:01:41.260> one<00:01:41.470> is<00:01:41.680> just<00:01:41.710> a<00:01:42.010> vent<00:01:42.280> if<00:01:42.970> you

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090 
this one is just a vent if you

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.200 
this one is just a vent if you
disconnect<00:01:43.420> those<00:01:44.610> there's<00:01:45.610> actually<00:01:45.970> enough

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.210 
disconnect those there's actually enough

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:49.140 
disconnect those there's actually enough
slack<00:01:46.600> in<00:01:46.630> the<00:01:46.990> fuel<00:01:47.260> line<00:01:47.590> to<00:01:47.890> allow<00:01:48.700> the<00:01:48.760> tank

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:49.150 
slack in the fuel line to allow the tank

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:53.250 
slack in the fuel line to allow the tank
to<00:01:49.510> be<00:01:49.630> completely<00:01:50.910> pivoted<00:01:51.910> at<00:01:52.540> right<00:01:52.810> angles

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:53.260 
to be completely pivoted at right angles

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.150 
to be completely pivoted at right angles
to<00:01:53.380> the<00:01:53.800> bike<00:01:54.070> and<00:01:54.700> I've<00:01:54.820> just<00:01:55.000> supported<00:01:55.570> on

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:56.160 
to the bike and I've just supported on

00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:01.350 
to the bike and I've just supported on
on<00:01:57.160> a<00:01:57.220> little<00:01:57.900> workmate<00:01:58.900> there<00:01:59.620> and<00:02:00.150> and<00:02:01.150> that

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:01.360 
on a little workmate there and and that

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.320 
on a little workmate there and and that
gives<00:02:02.140> you<00:02:02.320> much<00:02:02.740> better<00:02:02.890> access<00:02:03.430> to<00:02:03.729> the<00:02:04.120> top

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.330 
gives you much better access to the top

00:02:04.330 --> 00:02:07.080 
gives you much better access to the top
of<00:02:04.420> the<00:02:04.479> engine

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:07.090 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.020 

right<00:02:08.090> and<00:02:08.830> we've<00:02:09.830> taken<00:02:10.010> the<00:02:10.220> tank<00:02:10.550> officer

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030 
right and we've taken the tank officer

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:16.120 
right and we've taken the tank officer
say<00:02:11.300> and<00:02:11.860> we<00:02:12.860> just<00:02:13.070> sort<00:02:13.220> of<00:02:14.860> unplugged<00:02:15.860> some

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:16.130 
say and we just sort of unplugged some

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:17.830 
say and we just sort of unplugged some
of<00:02:16.220> the<00:02:16.310> wires<00:02:16.490> as<00:02:16.670> much<00:02:16.880> as<00:02:17.030> we<00:02:17.180> can

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
of the wires as much as we can

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.060 
of the wires as much as we can
we've<00:02:18.380> disconnected<00:02:19.010> as<00:02:19.780> rubber-hose<00:02:21.070> here

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:22.070 
we've disconnected as rubber-hose here

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:23.860 
we've disconnected as rubber-hose here
at<00:02:22.280> the<00:02:22.400> back<00:02:22.580> that<00:02:22.820> goes<00:02:23.060> into<00:02:23.300> the<00:02:23.570> air

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:23.870

the plug holes now this is a triple

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:36.100 
the plug holes now this is a triple
there's<00:02:33.170> two<00:02:33.470> per<00:02:33.680> cylinder<00:02:34.210> so<00:02:35.210> we've<00:02:35.480> got<00:02:35.780> in

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:36.110 
there's two per cylinder so we've got in

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.480 
there's two per cylinder so we've got in
total<00:02:36.620> we've<00:02:36.920> got<00:02:37.220> six<00:02:38.170> showing<00:02:39.170> there<00:02:39.410> and<00:02:40.340> I

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:40.490 
total we've got six showing there and I

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:42.310 
total we've got six showing there and I
think<00:02:40.730> it's<00:02:40.910> just<00:02:41.180> going<00:02:41.390> to<00:02:41.480> be<00:02:41.600> possible<00:02:42.020> to

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:42.320 
think it's just going to be possible to

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:46.600 
think it's just going to be possible to
get<00:02:42.500> a<00:02:43.360> spark<00:02:44.360> plug<00:02:44.450> tool<00:02:45.410> in<00:02:45.710> there<00:02:45.920> and<00:02:46.430> get

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:46.610 
get a spark plug tool in there and get

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:48.270 
get a spark plug tool in there and get
them<00:02:46.760> extracted<00:02:47.300> without<00:02:47.390> any<00:02:47.780> further

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:48.280 
them extracted without any further

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.320 
them extracted without any further
disassembly<00:02:49.280> but<00:02:49.520> if<00:02:49.640> necessary<00:02:50.120> we'll<00:02:50.210> have

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.330 
disassembly but if necessary we'll have

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.780 
disassembly but if necessary we'll have
to<00:02:50.420> take<00:02:50.600> the<00:02:50.750> coils<00:02:51.170> off<00:02:51.440> the<00:02:52.040> side<00:02:52.250> to<00:02:52.520> get<00:02:52.640> in

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:52.790 
to take the coils off the side to get in

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.450 
to take the coils off the side to get in
but<00:02:52.940> I<00:02:53.030> think<00:02:53.060> if<00:02:53.390> we're<00:02:53.540> careful<00:02:54.250> we<00:02:55.250> should

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:55.460 
but I think if we're careful we should

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:57.400 
but I think if we're careful we should
give<00:02:55.640> to<00:02:55.670> do<00:02:55.820> that<00:02:55.970> so<00:02:56.210> we're<00:02:56.810> going<00:02:56.930> to<00:02:56.990> do<00:02:57.140> one

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:57.410 
give to do that so we're going to do one

00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:58.720 
give to do that so we're going to do one
at<00:02:57.530> a<00:02:57.590> time<00:02:57.830> we're<00:02:58.010> going<00:02:58.160> to<00:02:58.220> gently<00:02:58.400> lever

00:02:58.720 --> 00:02:58.730 
at a time we're going to gently lever

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.230 
at a time we're going to gently lever
off<00:02:59.030> the<00:02:59.630> rubber<00:02:59.930> plugs<00:03:00.320> and<00:03:00.620> rubber<00:03:00.800> boots

inside the cylinders and then we'll take

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:13.660

say that we don't have anything falling
down<00:03:18.500> any<00:03:18.860> holes<00:03:19.160> and<00:03:20.080> we<00:03:21.080> don't<00:03:21.380> forget<00:03:21.640> which

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:22.640 
down any holes and we don't forget which

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.250 
down any holes and we don't forget which
is<00:03:22.670> which<00:03:22.880> other<00:03:23.300> they<00:03:23.420> are<00:03:23.540> actually<00:03:23.959> which

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
is which other they are actually which

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.050 
is which other they are actually which
lead<00:03:24.530> is<00:03:24.739> actually<00:03:25.070> labeled<00:03:25.489> for<00:03:25.700> the<00:03:25.730> number

lead is actually labeled for the number
of<00:03:26.150> plug<00:03:27.220> so<00:03:28.220> let's<00:03:29.030> get<00:03:29.150> on<00:03:29.300> with<00:03:29.330> it<00:03:29.570> these

00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:30.140 
of plug so let's get on with it these

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.410 
of plug so let's get on with it these
what<00:03:30.320> we've<00:03:30.410> decided<00:03:30.739> to<00:03:30.890> use<00:03:31.330> as<00:03:32.330> the

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:32.420 
what we've decided to use as the

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.590 
what we've decided to use as the
extraction<00:03:32.930> tool<00:03:33.110> is<00:03:33.380> the<00:03:33.709> spark<00:03:34.070> plug

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:34.600 
extraction tool is the spark plug

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.650 
extraction tool is the spark plug
extractor<00:03:35.600> which<00:03:35.750> is<00:03:35.959> in<00:03:36.380> the<00:03:36.680> toolkit<00:03:37.100> and

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:37.660 
extractor which is in the toolkit and

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:40.840 
extractor which is in the toolkit and
but<00:03:38.660> we've<00:03:38.780> used<00:03:38.900> a<00:03:39.140> 12<00:03:39.440> millimeter<00:03:39.850> stud

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:40.850 
but we've used a 12 millimeter stud

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:44.110 
but we've used a 12 millimeter stud
socket<00:03:41.390> here<00:03:42.250> which<00:03:43.250> actually<00:03:43.700> goes<00:03:43.850> inside

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:44.120 
socket here which actually goes inside

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.199 
socket here which actually goes inside
that<00:03:44.720> with<00:03:45.320> a<00:03:45.350> bit<00:03:45.530> of<00:03:45.560> tape<00:03:45.860> and<00:03:46.220> to<00:03:47.030> make<00:03:47.180> a

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:47.209 
that with a bit of tape and to make a

00:03:47.209 --> 00:03:48.790 
that with a bit of tape and to make a
really<00:03:47.630> nice<00:03:47.780> tight<00:03:48.080> fit<00:03:48.290> so<00:03:48.380> we<00:03:48.470> don't<00:03:48.620> lose

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:48.800 
really nice tight fit so we don't lose

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:51.850 
really nice tight fit so we don't lose
the<00:03:48.980> thing<00:03:49.160> down<00:03:49.370> there<00:03:49.959> and<00:03:50.959> an<00:03:51.410> extension

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:51.860 
the thing down there and an extension

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:55.120 
the thing down there and an extension
rod<00:03:52.250> and<00:03:52.519> then<00:03:53.030> a<00:03:53.269> conventional<00:03:53.930> ratchet<00:03:54.380> so

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:55.130 
rod and then a conventional ratchet so

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:57.509 
rod and then a conventional ratchet so
you're<00:03:55.550> going<00:03:55.730> to<00:03:55.790> put<00:03:56.000> that<00:03:56.030> down<00:03:56.180> entry

00:03:57.509 --> 00:03:57.519 
you're going to put that down entry

00:03:57.519 --> 00:04:07.020 
you're going to put that down entry
number<00:03:58.519> one<00:03:58.820> plug

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030 

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:10.780 

then<00:04:08.030> just<00:04:08.350> gently<00:04:09.350> undo<00:04:10.310> it<00:04:10.460> out<00:04:10.610> the

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:10.790 
then just gently undo it out the

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:23.140 
then just gently undo it out the
Phillips<00:04:11.320> that's<00:04:12.320> it<00:04:12.590> I<00:04:20.950> think<00:04:21.950> we<00:04:22.610> should<00:04:22.940> put

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:23.150 
Phillips that's it I think we should put

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:32.310 
Phillips that's it I think we should put
a<00:04:23.180> plug<00:04:23.450> there<00:04:23.950> yeah<00:04:24.950> and<00:04:26.680> as<00:04:29.020> as<00:04:30.020> the<00:04:30.290> plug

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:32.320 
a plug there yeah and as as the plug

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:35.520 
a plug there yeah and as as the plug
normal<00:04:33.320> looking<00:04:33.560> fairly<00:04:33.830> big<00:04:34.070> tap<00:04:34.460> on<00:04:34.700> it<00:04:34.850> but

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:35.530 
normal looking fairly big tap on it but

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:38.590 
normal looking fairly big tap on it but
normally<00:04:36.530> sort<00:04:36.890> of<00:04:36.980> color<00:04:37.310> sort<00:04:37.880> of<00:04:37.940> tans<00:04:38.300> or

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:38.600 
normally sort of color sort of tans or

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:40.420 
normally sort of color sort of tans or
the<00:04:38.660> color<00:04:38.930> which<00:04:39.110> it's<00:04:39.890> just<00:04:40.160> it's<00:04:40.340> all

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:40.430 
the color which it's just it's all

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:43.060 
the color which it's just it's all
running<00:04:40.760> normally<00:04:40.970> in<00:04:41.300> there<00:04:41.510> so<00:04:42.440> now<00:04:42.890> it's

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:43.070 
running normally in there so now it's

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:46.060 
running normally in there so now it's
going<00:04:43.190> to<00:04:43.250> pop<00:04:43.430> in<00:04:43.640> the<00:04:43.760> first<00:04:44.000> iridium<00:04:45.070> and

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:46.070 
going to pop in the first iridium and

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:49.150 
going to pop in the first iridium and
it's<00:04:46.640> worth<00:04:46.820> mentioning<00:04:47.060> that<00:04:48.160> these

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:49.160 
it's worth mentioning that these

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:53.530 
it's worth mentioning that these
yridians<00:04:51.250> converting<00:04:52.250> gaps<00:04:52.490> there's<00:04:53.450> a

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:53.540 
yridians converting gaps there's a

00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:57.090 
yridians converting gaps there's a
little<00:04:54.130> protector<00:04:55.130> there<00:04:55.540> over<00:04:56.540> the<00:04:56.690> actual

00:04:57.090 --> 00:04:57.100 
little protector there over the actual

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:00.400 
little protector there over the actual

doesn't have it so we'll just take it
off<00:05:23.960> so<00:05:24.350> that<00:05:24.430> it<00:05:25.430> fits<00:05:25.700> nicely<00:05:26.170> now<00:05:27.170> useful

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:35.780 
to avoid cross threading where you use

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:37.750 
to avoid cross threading where you use
as<00:05:35.990> a<00:05:36.020> little<00:05:36.350> section<00:05:36.740> of<00:05:36.770> garden<00:05:37.160> hose<00:05:37.370> pipe

as a little section of garden hose pipe
to<00:05:38.600> actually<00:05:38.870> just<00:05:39.080> get<00:05:39.290> this<00:05:39.500> plug<00:05:40.040> into<00:05:40.880> the

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:41.180 
to actually just get this plug into the

00:05:41.180 --> 00:05:44.680 
to actually just get this plug into the
right<00:05:41.300> place<00:05:41.600> and<00:05:42.400> seated<00:05:43.400> properly<00:05:43.690> before

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:44.690 
right place and seated properly before

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:47.200 
right place and seated properly before
we<00:05:44.930> start<00:05:45.200> to<00:05:45.290> tighten<00:05:45.560> it<00:05:45.620> up<00:05:45.740> and<00:05:45.980> if<00:05:46.850> you<00:05:47.000> use

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:47.210 
we start to tighten it up and if you use

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:48.580 
we start to tighten it up and if you use
something<00:05:47.570> flexible<00:05:47.750> like<00:05:48.140> this<00:05:48.320> you<00:05:48.470> can

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:48.590 
something flexible like this you can

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:50.230 
something flexible like this you can
actually<00:05:48.650> feel<00:05:49.160> with<00:05:49.550> your<00:05:49.670> hand<00:05:49.940> whether

00:05:50.230 --> 00:05:50.240 
actually feel with your hand whether

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:51.600 
actually feel with your hand whether
it's<00:05:50.480> cross<00:05:50.660> threading<00:05:51.020> or<00:05:51.140> not

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:51.610 
it's cross threading or not

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:54.340 
it's cross threading or not
and<00:05:52.610> that<00:05:53.210> can<00:05:53.450> save<00:05:53.720> an<00:05:53.930> awful<00:05:54.020> lot<00:05:54.320> of

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:54.350 
and that can save an awful lot of

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:58.030 
and that can save an awful lot of
expensive<00:05:55.070> work<00:05:56.030> if<00:05:56.480> it<00:05:56.660> goes<00:05:56.900> wrong<00:05:57.140> so<00:05:57.860> we're

00:05:58.030 --> 00:05:58.040 
expensive work if it goes wrong so we're

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.640 
expensive work if it goes wrong so we're
going<00:05:58.160> to<00:05:58.220> use<00:05:58.790> this<00:05:58.910> little<00:05:59.090> trick<00:05:59.390> first<00:06:00.200> to

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:00.650 
going to use this little trick first to

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:10.820 
going to use this little trick first to
see<00:06:00.980> each<00:06:01.160> plug

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:10.830 

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:44.380 

you

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:44.390 

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:47.829 

you

00:06:47.829 --> 00:06:47.839 

00:06:47.839 --> 00:06:53.209 

now<00:06:48.839> I<00:06:49.139> thought<00:06:49.740> I<00:06:49.800> was<00:06:49.979> plug<00:06:50.479> in<00:06:51.479> and<00:06:52.219> it's

00:06:53.209 --> 00:06:53.219 
now I thought I was plug in and it's

00:06:53.219 --> 00:06:55.939 
now I thought I was plug in and it's
important<00:06:53.759> that<00:06:53.849> you<00:06:54.240> get<00:06:54.449> the<00:06:54.839> and<00:06:55.229> spot<00:06:55.740> pad

00:06:55.939 --> 00:06:55.949 
important that you get the and spot pad

00:06:55.949 --> 00:06:58.329 
important that you get the and spot pad
cap<00:06:56.279> seat<00:06:56.939> properly<00:06:57.449> on<00:06:57.539> the<00:06:57.629> top<00:06:57.809> of<00:06:57.990> the<00:06:58.080> plug

00:06:58.329 --> 00:06:58.339 
cap seat properly on the top of the plug

00:06:58.339 --> 00:07:00.860 
cap seat properly on the top of the plug
so<00:06:59.339> we're<00:06:59.669> going<00:06:59.789> to<00:06:59.849> push<00:07:00.330> down<00:07:00.360> you<00:07:00.659> should

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:00.870 
so we're going to push down you should

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:05.950 
so we're going to push down you should
just<00:07:00.990> a<00:07:01.139> little<00:07:01.349> click<00:07:01.710> and<00:07:02.039> it<00:07:02.159> goes<00:07:02.339> home

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:05.960 

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:07.969 

then<00:07:06.960> up<00:07:07.229> that's<00:07:07.529> it

00:07:07.969 --> 00:07:07.979 
then up that's it

00:07:07.979 --> 00:07:10.850 
then up that's it
that's<00:07:08.759> securely<00:07:09.210> on<00:07:09.419> the<00:07:09.539> top<00:07:09.749> and<00:07:10.710> we

00:07:10.850 --> 00:07:10.860 
that's securely on the top and we

00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:13.489 
that's securely on the top and we
plugged<00:07:11.129> it<00:07:11.930> that's<00:07:12.930> all<00:07:13.139> the<00:07:13.229> plugs

00:07:13.489 --> 00:07:13.499 
plugged it that's all the plugs

00:07:13.499 --> 00:07:16.790 
plugged it that's all the plugs
installed<00:07:13.800> and<00:07:14.520> tank<00:07:15.449> is<00:07:15.629> back<00:07:15.809> on<00:07:16.050> all<00:07:16.499> of<00:07:16.559> the

00:07:16.790 --> 00:07:16.800 
installed and tank is back on all of the

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:20.119 
installed and tank is back on all of the
overflow<00:07:17.150> pipes<00:07:18.150> re<00:07:18.719> routed<00:07:18.960> correctly<00:07:19.169> check

00:07:20.119 --> 00:07:20.129 
overflow pipes re routed correctly check

00:07:20.129 --> 00:07:22.339 
overflow pipes re routed correctly check
nothing<00:07:20.520> is<00:07:20.639> trapped<00:07:20.999> under<00:07:21.389> there<00:07:21.539> so<00:07:22.199> the

00:07:22.339 --> 00:07:22.349 
nothing is trapped under there so the

00:07:22.349 --> 00:07:25.339 
nothing is trapped under there so the
next<00:07:22.529> job<00:07:22.800> is<00:07:23.039> get<00:07:24.029> seat<00:07:24.270> back<00:07:24.449> on<00:07:24.629> side<00:07:25.020> panels

00:07:25.339 --> 00:07:25.349 
next job is get seat back on side panels

00:07:25.349 --> 00:07:29.659 
next job is get seat back on side panels
back<00:07:25.469> on<00:07:25.680> and<00:07:25.919> then<00:07:26.699> fire<00:07:26.969> it<00:07:26.999> up<00:07:27.180> for<00:07:27.389> a<00:07:27.419> test
