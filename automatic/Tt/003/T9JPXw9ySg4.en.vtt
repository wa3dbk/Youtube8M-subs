I'm<00:00:01.740> going<00:00:02.159> to<00:00:02.340> show<00:00:02.580> you<00:00:02.610> how<00:00:02.970> to<00:00:03.030> build<00:00:03.419> a

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:03.600 
I'm going to show you how to build a

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.200 
I'm going to show you how to build a
Lego<00:00:03.840> hamster

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:05.210 
Lego hamster

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:08.540 
Lego hamster
you<00:00:06.210> may<00:00:06.420> have<00:00:06.600> seen<00:00:06.810> my<00:00:07.080> previous<00:00:07.290> video<00:00:08.130> how

you may have seen my previous video how

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.259 
you may have seen my previous video how
to<00:00:08.580> build<00:00:09.059> a<00:00:09.269> Lego<00:00:09.570> capped<00:00:10.849> these<00:00:11.849> are<00:00:12.150> the

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:12.269 
to build a Lego capped these are the

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:13.879 
to build a Lego capped these are the
bits<00:00:12.450> you<00:00:12.599> need<00:00:12.960> for<00:00:13.259> the<00:00:13.349> old<00:00:13.500> and<00:00:13.620> I<00:00:13.740> go

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
bits you need for the old and I go

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:26.960 
bits you need for the old and I go
hamster<00:00:21.890> first<00:00:22.890> of<00:00:23.100> all<00:00:24.050> you<00:00:25.050> get<00:00:25.320> three<00:00:25.970> three

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
hamster first of all you get three three

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:34.850 
hamster first of all you get three three
by<00:00:27.359> two<00:00:27.420> bits<00:00:28.019> like<00:00:28.439> that<00:00:31.880> you<00:00:33.320> put<00:00:34.320> them<00:00:34.590> next

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
by two bits like that you put them next

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:45.770 
by two bits like that you put them next
to<00:00:35.130> each<00:00:35.430> other<00:00:38.090> right<00:00:39.350> back<00:00:41.690> then<00:00:44.539> you<00:00:45.539> get

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
to each other right back then you get

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:57.930 
to each other right back then you get
two<00:00:46.910> black<00:00:47.910> one<00:00:48.300> by<00:00:48.600> one<00:00:48.930> bit

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:57.940 

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:13.380 

thank<00:00:58.840> you<00:00:59.020> put<00:00:59.260> them<00:01:02.280> inside<00:01:06.240> that<00:01:09.300> one<00:01:12.210> so<00:01:13.210> it

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:13.390 
thank you put them inside that one so it

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:19.790 
thank you put them inside that one so it
looks<00:01:13.630> a<00:01:13.810> bit<00:01:13.840> like<00:01:14.229> that<00:01:17.250> then<00:01:18.250> you<00:01:18.580> get<00:01:18.820> to

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:19.800 
looks a bit like that then you get to

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:26.520 
looks a bit like that then you get to
yellow<00:01:20.800> to<00:01:21.430> buy<00:01:21.790> one<00:01:23.340> put<00:01:24.340> it<00:01:24.840> down<00:01:25.840> the<00:01:26.259> middle

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:26.530 
yellow to buy one put it down the middle

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:34.920 
yellow to buy one put it down the middle
like<00:01:27.210> that<00:01:31.950> and<00:01:32.950> you<00:01:33.190> get<00:01:33.369> to<00:01:33.430> one<00:01:34.210> by<00:01:34.509> four

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:34.930 
like that and you get to one by four

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:42.270 
like that and you get to one by four
bits<00:01:35.700> one<00:01:37.649> two<00:01:39.780> let<00:01:40.780> me<00:01:40.869> put<00:01:41.200> them<00:01:41.440> down<00:01:41.950> the

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:42.280 
bits one two let me put them down the

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:50.150 
bits one two let me put them down the
sides<00:01:44.910> whoops

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:50.160 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:56.730 

like<00:01:51.160> so

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.600 

then<00:01:57.740> you<00:01:58.040> get<00:01:58.220> another<00:01:58.280> to<00:01:59.240> boy<00:01:59.570> one<00:01:59.870> bit<00:02:00.229> and

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:00.610 
then you get another to boy one bit and

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:15.930 
then you get another to boy one bit and
put<00:02:01.610> it<00:02:02.979> like<00:02:03.979> that<00:02:07.780> no<00:02:08.780> wait<00:02:08.990> that's<00:02:09.140> wrong

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:15.940 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:20.949 

you<00:02:16.940> put<00:02:17.150> it<00:02:17.420> back<00:02:17.680> from<00:02:18.680> the<00:02:18.920> end<00:02:19.690> by<00:02:20.690> one

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:20.959 
you put it back from the end by one

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:30.640 
you put it back from the end by one
square<00:02:23.170> so<00:02:24.170> it<00:02:24.319> looks<00:02:24.650> a<00:02:25.010> bit<00:02:25.040> like<00:02:27.160> that<00:02:29.650> then

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:30.650 
square so it looks a bit like that then

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:37.870 
square so it looks a bit like that then
you<00:02:31.459> get<00:02:31.700> a<00:02:32.060> red<00:02:32.750> two<00:02:33.670> by<00:02:34.670> one<00:02:34.700> block<00:02:36.550> and<00:02:37.550> put

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:37.880 
you get a red two by one block and put

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:49.830 
you get a red two by one block and put
it<00:02:38.150> on<00:02:38.600> like<00:02:43.480> you<00:02:44.480> get<00:02:44.930> to<00:02:45.230> one<00:02:45.950> by<00:02:46.310> one<00:02:46.580> blocks

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:49.840 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:54.970 

put<00:02:50.840> them<00:02:51.050> either<00:02:51.290> side<00:02:51.709> on<00:02:52.310> the<00:02:52.640> red<00:02:52.850> block<00:02:53.980> so

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
put them either side on the red block so

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:04.500 
put them either side on the red block so
it<00:02:55.100> looks<00:02:55.310> a<00:02:55.459> bit<00:02:55.489> like<00:02:55.700> that<00:03:02.620> then<00:03:03.620> you<00:03:04.040> get

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:04.510 
it looks a bit like that then you get

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:09.390 
it looks a bit like that then you get
three<00:03:06.820> two<00:03:07.820> by<00:03:08.090> three<00:03:08.390> blocks

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:09.400 
three two by three blocks

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:19.750 
three two by three blocks
one<00:03:11.110> two<00:03:13.030> three<00:03:15.459> and<00:03:16.459> you<00:03:16.519> put<00:03:17.239> them<00:03:18.489> on<00:03:19.489> the

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
one two three and you put them on the

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:25.420 
one two three and you put them on the
top<00:03:20.260> like<00:03:21.260> this<00:03:21.730> one

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:36.880 

two<00:03:30.129> three<00:03:33.010> then<00:03:34.030> you<00:03:35.030> get<00:03:35.239> to<00:03:35.569> black<00:03:36.170> one<00:03:36.590> by

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:36.890 
two three then you get to black one by

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:43.740 
two three then you get to black one by
ones<00:03:37.219> and<00:03:38.799> put<00:03:39.799> them<00:03:39.859> up<00:03:40.250> on<00:03:40.939> the<00:03:41.719> corners

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:43.750 
ones and put them up on the corners

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:53.069 
ones and put them up on the corners
right<00:03:47.200> yeah

00:03:53.069 --> 00:03:53.079 

00:03:53.079 --> 00:04:00.429 

then<00:03:55.359> you<00:03:56.359> move<00:03:56.599> on<00:03:56.930> to<00:03:56.959> your<00:03:57.439> feet<00:03:59.169> you<00:04:00.169> make

00:04:00.429 --> 00:04:00.439 
then you move on to your feet you make

00:04:00.439 --> 00:04:06.039 
then you move on to your feet you make
four<00:04:00.859> little<00:04:01.220> feet<00:04:01.730> by<00:04:02.030> getting<00:04:02.510> a<00:04:03.220> red<00:04:04.720> to<00:04:05.720> by

00:04:06.039 --> 00:04:06.049 
four little feet by getting a red to by

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:11.020 
four little feet by getting a red to by
one<00:04:06.319> bit<00:04:06.709> another<00:04:07.489> small<00:04:07.790> one<00:04:07.849> by<00:04:08.419> one<00:04:08.720> bit<00:04:10.030> and

00:04:11.020 --> 00:04:11.030

your honks this body you turn each other

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:51.950 
your honks this body you turn each other
you<00:04:44.530> get<00:04:44.740> one<00:04:45.009> toe<00:04:45.639> foot<00:04:46.000> and<00:04:46.900> put<00:04:47.379> it<00:04:50.879> when

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:51.960 
you get one toe foot and put it when

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:57.770 
you get one toe foot and put it when
like<00:04:52.960> that<00:04:55.319> and<00:04:56.319> you<00:04:56.440> turn<00:04:56.800> it<00:04:56.979> around<00:04:57.069> put
