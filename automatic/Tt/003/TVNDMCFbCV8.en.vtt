00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:08.460
 comparison of armored skin of an armadillo 

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:10.889
 scales he is galina or with coarse too and 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:13.259
 Indian elephant thin epidermis 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.420
 which covers our body can 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.550
 seem not very reliable protection from 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.320
 the world around us but all we need 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.390
 make a closer look at ours 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:23.580
 silky smooth skin to make sure 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.769
 what is this scaly armor just 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.230
 very small it is formed by protein 

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:30.599
 keratin- leaving skin composition of lizards and 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.430
 other animals of course our skin 

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:34.290
 much thinner and more delicate 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.270
 but usually this is not a problem because we 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:38.460
 no need to survive in such conditions 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.739
 also our scales don't need to be very 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.390
 strong because our body every day 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:44.850
 updates layer of tens of millions 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.770
 scales scale endless process 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.270
 production of this armor occurs 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.129
 thanks to the same gigantic and 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.530
 countless army of skin cells under 

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:54.420
 epidermis every second more than 500 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.770
 new cells are created in the cart process 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.840
 stem cells in the lower layer 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.670
 epidermis and they join this 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:01.649
 army gradually migrates surface 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.899
 skin because young cells are pushing them 

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:05.939
 up and travel to the surface one 

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:07.409
 from the types of self-sacrifice to create 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:09.180
 protective barrier between us and the world 

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:10.650
 each cell is programmed 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.729
 destroy yourself upon reaching 

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:13.619
 skin surface 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:15.540
 using enzymes to destroy it 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:17.520
 vital parts as a result 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.380
 forming a solid flat honor and 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.630
 process it is attached by likeness 

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.460
 antennae to adjacent cells and highlights 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.700
 portion of fat to fill the space 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:29.070
 between them the outer layer of the skin consists of 

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:32.280
 15 layers of scaly cellular network 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:34.650
 thick with plastic wrap is yours 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:36.299
 flexible armor is also waterproof 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:38.070
 is surprisingly effective 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:40.320
 barrier to bacteria and 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.570
 fungi and viruses and other unfriendly 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:44.430
 intruders while acidity 

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.960
 fat does not give annoying microbes 

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:48.540
 breed on the surface of the skin 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:50.399
 covering the shop of course the skin is fine 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.159
 works protecting us from microscopic 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:55.229
 threats but still our brains they later 

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:59.329
 works like pangolin scales 

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.329
 helping us not to feed lions
