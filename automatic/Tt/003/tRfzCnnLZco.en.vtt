00:00:00.739 --> 00:00:01.949
 cantinflas 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:04.949
 and those of india international cejil 

00:00:08.039 --> 00:00:09.179
 the night worm 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:11.899
 in the middle of summer be compassionate 

00:00:11.899 --> 00:00:15.489
 there is a member of my crew our little friend is dreaming 

00:00:15.489 --> 00:00:17.960
 something very nice 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.150
 tomorrow will be Saturday city 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.119
 How beautiful is my birthday now, and these are the maÃ±anitas now 

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:28.409
 funes winner of the mosso peace is that with velasquez received 

00:00:28.409 --> 00:00:31.699
 gifts that my classmates sang to me that gives you a wish 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.870
 the friend's appointment is a beautiful dream but it is only a dream 

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:41.280
 captain day 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.700
 I thought you wanted me for a birthday 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.700
 I still feel a lot of friends but it's not your birthday 

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:49.130
 Friday and Saturday 

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:50.340
 I do not say no 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:51.630
 Or what is the same 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:53.859
 but beyond any business 

00:00:53.859 --> 00:00:54.890
 true 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.450
 neither Argentina nor what happened to sabah 

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:01.970
 we lost it last night we crossed the international time line the meridian 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:05.400
 180 and I finish my birthday 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.150
 It seems that being consigned at this time also serves for other things 

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:14.470
 supposed position is despite the time with her husband 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.890
 Christopher Columbus 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.010
 there will be no cancer 

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:19.840
 we want to know where we are 

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.770
 I do not want the steps that the captain of the world has given way to the world 

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:26.350
 says the world is round 

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:29.930
 naturally and I still affirm it but I must know where we are 

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:32.150
 poor color 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:33.030
 as they say 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.610
 when he sailed he did not know where he was going when he arrived he did not know where he was 

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.610
 and when he remarried he never knew where he was 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.390
 and how would I know anything about him 

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.110
 surrounded by water everywhere 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.200
 the sailors had been using a compass for 300 years before they 

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.620
 born colon 

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:56.920
 you hung up and with that knowing what direction and exactly go and for two 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.030
 a thousand years they used a device called astrolabe with him he knew in the hour 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.860
 by sun and stars and find out how far south or north 

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:07.400
 was your latitude is not true very good friend 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.070
 a man called made a critic in all this 

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:13.070
 a more exact device that is called stagnates 

00:02:13.779 --> 00:02:15.699
 and it's that moment that makes 

00:02:15.699 --> 00:02:17.919
 you look through this telescope 

00:02:17.919 --> 00:02:20.919
 what is fair is placing the sun on the horizon 

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:26.749
 and reading the aricle you can calculate the exact time and our latitude 

00:02:26.749 --> 00:02:32.299
 that's called aiming at the sun so he pointed to the sun and I know where 

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:34.419
 we are still not 

00:02:34.419 --> 00:02:38.699
 we know the latitude or how far we are north or south of the 

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:39.629
 Ecuador 

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:44.090
 but that are east / northeast we are north and longitude in the equator 

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:47.110
 it means a difference of 25 thousand miles 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.579
 that is 40 thousand kilometers 

00:02:49.579 --> 00:02:52.810
 people are like I was not so upsetting so it's 

00:02:53.339 --> 00:02:56.590
 he had no way of being able to calculate his length 

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.290
 the chronometer was not invented until 250 years later 

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:05.559
 it is just like the louvre a super accurate and large clock 

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:08.869
 measures time with a variation of one or two seconds per year 

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:13.459
 if we're talking here, you did not have any, first we have to establish 

00:03:13.459 --> 00:03:15.309
 a basic education 

00:03:15.309 --> 00:03:19.689
 at that time england was the center of world navigation the real 

00:03:19.689 --> 00:03:23.079
 Greenwich observatory was considered today after the length events 

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:28.659
 the globe was divided into 360 degrees 

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:33.329
 the midpoint around the world would be 180 degree 

00:03:34.079 --> 00:03:37.079
 that is, the 180th meridian is not true 

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:39.419
 which to be very competitive years 

00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:43.889
 yes because he had to mess with me now I have ten presumably there 

00:03:43.889 --> 00:03:47.410
 both boats departing from the 107 meridian 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:49.869
 one more and the axis and the other one towards the west 

00:03:49.869 --> 00:03:53.959
 one in the direction the sun moves and the other away from it to 

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:57.669
 when they are in bing said england the one that went west 

00:03:57.669 --> 00:03:58.790
 there will be married 

00:03:58.790 --> 00:03:59.820
 12 hours 

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:02.820
 and the other one will have lost 12 hours 

00:04:03.419 --> 00:04:08.059
 both will arrive in England at exactly the same time with a whole day of 

00:04:08.059 --> 00:04:08.979
 difference 

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:12.789
 I do not know what to do to stop this confusing if you're right 

00:04:12.789 --> 00:04:16.029
 and that's why most of the important countries related to 

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:19.690
 navigation sent representatives to the maritime conference in washington dc 

00:04:20.279 --> 00:04:23.669
 in 1884 to deal with this matter 

00:04:23.669 --> 00:04:28.240
 at the midpoint of the globe on the 180th meridian they agreed to set the 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.669
 international time line 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:35.469
 if a boat going west rus to this line on Monday at that time to 

00:04:35.469 --> 00:04:40.099
 it will be Tuesday but if the cross at midnight the day of that ship will 

00:04:40.099 --> 00:04:41.500
 will return Wednesday 

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:44.629
 on Tuesday he lost in the hour change of the league 

00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:49.569
 but if a ship that goes east crossing the marquez line will find 

00:04:49.569 --> 00:04:52.569
 another whole Tuesday waiting 

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:56.930
 Well, the more I do not understand, the more confused I am, Captain 

00:04:59.199 --> 00:05:03.039
 the timeline is important for boats but it is even more important 

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:04.879
 for airplanes 

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:08.319
 that fly faster than the sun advances and faster than him 

00:05:08.319 --> 00:05:09.059
 alone 

00:05:09.059 --> 00:05:12.319
 today from that month and a half a bonus is not an albatross 

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:18.000
 once truly remarkable but talking about the sea for days and weeks and 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:18.889
 rest 

00:05:18.889 --> 00:05:21.139
 and what they propose and stagnates 

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:24.409
 however he knows exactly where he was 

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:26.729
 and how to go home 

00:05:26.729 --> 00:05:31.019
 and how can it be the same nobody knows only the albatross himself 

00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:40.110
 I think it's the base ross needs a stopwatch and a good map 

00:05:40.749 --> 00:05:42.710
 both Argentina denied 

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:45.710
 regretted that in the lost and happy birthday 

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:50.240
 I do not have a pending capital, I do not care what boxes I'm going to do 

00:05:50.930 --> 00:05:54.170
 offer one at the same time that the government will step on the 

00:05:54.169 --> 00:05:56.919
 cutlery of the time that with the other direction 

00:05:56.919 --> 00:05:58.309
 and so I will have 

00:05:58.309 --> 00:06:01.959
 happy birthday I'm not a singer hahahahaha
