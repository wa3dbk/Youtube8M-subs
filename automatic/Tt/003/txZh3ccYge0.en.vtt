00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:34.540 
do different Sciences such as biology

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:38.520 
do different Sciences such as biology
chemistry<00:00:35.020> and<00:00:35.440> physics<00:00:35.770> I<00:00:37.230> really<00:00:38.230> enjoy

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:38.530 
chemistry and physics I really enjoy

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.240 
chemistry and physics I really enjoy
size<00:00:38.830> I<00:00:39.930> do<00:00:40.930> for<00:00:41.320> my<00:00:41.410> stream<00:00:41.650> biology<00:00:42.160> at

size I do for my stream biology at

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:45.900 
size I do for my stream biology at
higher<00:00:42.460> level<00:00:42.760> and<00:00:43.230> I'm<00:00:44.370> getting<00:00:45.370> predicted<00:00:45.820> a

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:45.910 
higher level and I'm getting predicted a

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:49.729 
higher level and I'm getting predicted a
seven<00:00:46.270> so<00:00:46.720> I<00:00:46.989> think<00:00:47.050> I'm<00:00:47.890> doing<00:00:48.309> quite<00:00:48.430> well

school in general is a very supportive
place<00:01:12.200> so<00:01:12.920> learning<00:01:13.550> doesn't<00:01:13.730> just<00:01:13.910> take

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:14.180 
place so learning doesn't just take

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.020 
place so learning doesn't just take
place<00:01:14.240> inside<00:01:14.960> a<00:01:15.200> classroom<00:01:15.530> because<00:01:16.250> even

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:21.260 
after school or during breaks I think

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:22.870 
after school or during breaks I think
the<00:01:21.470> school<00:01:21.740> definitely<00:01:22.280> encouraged<00:01:22.670> us<00:01:22.850> to

I received 11a stars for my ID CSE
results<00:01:32.040> the<00:01:33.040> school<00:01:33.520> just<00:01:34.000> really<00:01:34.480> wants<00:01:34.930> to

make sure that you flourish to your own
full<00:01:37.810> potential<00:01:38.380> and<00:01:38.590> that's<00:01:38.920> different<00:01:39.430> for

full potential and that's different for

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:47.200 
full potential and that's different for
everyone

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:56.380 

I<00:01:53.500> like<00:01:54.500> to<00:01:54.680> challenge<00:01:54.890> myself<00:01:55.159> the<00:01:56.030> school

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.390 
I like to challenge myself the school

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.270 
I like to challenge myself the school
provides<00:01:56.840> me<00:01:57.050> with<00:01:57.080> very<00:01:57.470> challenges<00:01:58.070> and

00:01:58.270 --> 00:01:58.280 
provides me with very challenges and

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:04.260 
provides me with very challenges and
very<00:01:58.670> many<00:01:59.030> opportunities<00:01:59.659> to<00:02:00.200> perform

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:06.880 

it's<00:02:05.270> really<00:02:05.540> about<00:02:05.720> breaking<00:02:06.050> I<00:02:06.590> guess

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
it's really about breaking I guess

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:15.550 
it's really about breaking I guess
breaking<00:02:07.400> some<00:02:07.580> boundaries<00:02:14.350> challenges<00:02:15.350> are

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560 
breaking some boundaries challenges are

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.560 
breaking some boundaries challenges are
problems<00:02:16.070> that<00:02:16.250> will<00:02:16.610> most<00:02:16.820> likely<00:02:16.970> face<00:02:17.360> in

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:17.570 
problems that will most likely face in

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:22.990 
problems that will most likely face in
your<00:02:17.660> life<00:02:19.510> to<00:02:20.510> me<00:02:20.690> challenge<00:02:21.380> is<00:02:22.000> something

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:23.000 
your life to me challenge is something

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.570 
your life to me challenge is something
that<00:02:23.480> I<00:02:23.510> look<00:02:23.690> forward<00:02:24.020> to<00:02:24.170> and<00:02:24.580> something

00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:25.580 
that I look forward to and something

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:31.000 
that I look forward to and something
that<00:02:25.730> where<00:02:26.450> I<00:02:26.510> gain<00:02:26.720> new<00:02:26.900> experiences<00:02:29.980> how<00:02:30.980> I

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
that where I gain new experiences how I

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.740 
that where I gain new experiences how I
define<00:02:31.640> challenge<00:02:32.030> I<00:02:32.180> would<00:02:32.800> explain<00:02:33.800> it<00:02:33.860> as

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
define challenge I would explain it as

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:41.740 
define challenge I would explain it as
some<00:02:35.750> drawing<00:02:36.320> maybe<00:02:38.770> by<00:02:39.770> trying<00:02:40.610> and<00:02:41.090> trying

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
some drawing maybe by trying and trying

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:47.589 
some drawing maybe by trying and trying
until<00:02:42.290> you<00:02:42.620> can<00:02:43.040> do<00:02:43.250> it<00:02:44.080> bypass

00:02:47.589 --> 00:02:47.599 

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:51.520 

today<00:02:48.290> we<00:02:48.769> were<00:02:49.459> doing<00:02:50.060> a<00:02:50.269> genetic<00:02:50.530> sequences

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:51.530 
today we were doing a genetic sequences

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:56.319 
today we were doing a genetic sequences
I'm<00:02:52.159> not<00:02:52.340> really<00:02:52.579> true<00:02:52.939> gymnastics<00:02:54.340> if<00:02:55.340> you<00:02:56.030> do

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:56.329 
I'm not really true gymnastics if you do

00:02:56.329 --> 00:02:58.000 
I'm not really true gymnastics if you do
something<00:02:56.900> which<00:02:57.049> is<00:02:57.079> a<00:02:57.230> challenge<00:02:57.739> what

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:58.010 
something which is a challenge what

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:00.220 
something which is a challenge what
makes<00:02:58.219> and<00:02:58.430> escapes<00:02:58.790> on<00:02:58.999> it<00:02:59.180> then<00:02:59.359> you<00:02:59.689> can<00:03:00.049> do

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:00.230 
makes and escapes on it then you can do

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.610 
makes and escapes on it then you can do
it<00:03:00.349> again<00:03:00.620> and<00:03:00.829> improve<00:03:01.310> here<00:03:02.109> it<00:03:03.109> definitely

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
it again and improve here it definitely

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.440 
it again and improve here it definitely
is<00:03:03.799> one<00:03:04.099> of<00:03:04.189> the<00:03:04.280> stepping<00:03:04.549> stones<00:03:04.969> and<00:03:05.269> making

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 
is one of the stepping stones and making

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:07.780 
is one of the stepping stones and making

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:07.790 
sure it and helping you understand this

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:12.729 
sure it and helping you understand this
is<00:03:07.909> the<00:03:08.000> power<00:03:08.239> of<00:03:08.329> motivation<00:03:11.739> new

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:12.739 
is the power of motivation new

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:14.770 
is the power of motivation new
challenges<00:03:13.189> can<00:03:13.370> always<00:03:13.609> be<00:03:13.819> overcome<00:03:14.569> but

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
challenges can always be overcome but

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:16.869 
challenges can always be overcome but
then<00:03:14.959> I<00:03:15.169> there<00:03:15.829> will<00:03:15.980> be<00:03:16.010> lots<00:03:16.280> of<00:03:16.400> mistakes

00:03:16.869 --> 00:03:16.879 
then I there will be lots of mistakes

00:03:16.879 --> 00:03:33.830 
then I there will be lots of mistakes
and<00:03:17.239> I<00:03:17.719> will<00:03:17.930> have<00:03:18.109> lots<00:03:18.349> of<00:03:18.439> lessons
