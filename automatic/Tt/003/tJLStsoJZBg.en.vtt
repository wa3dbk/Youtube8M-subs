 years ago I did not like Sao Paulo

 Good place to work but only and are 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.140

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:12.299
 showing another side a more 

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:14.670
 Architectural beautiful side more humanistic 

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:16.229
 a more human side and and time 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.430
 conquering slowly but I was 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.530
 meeting the world 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.390
 when I came here in this space on the 24th 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.340
 It was ours to walk from this building. 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.909
 exactly what I have been feeling for 

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:31.140
 city ​​or is a love passion a 

00:01:26.909 --> 00:01:32.460
 We want to thank our city 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.600
 everything she does for us that many 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.030
 Sometimes we have a very long day. 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.890
 and we do not notice 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.260
 that our city has no beauty 

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:44.490
 natural resources like Rio de Janeiro but 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:46.409
 architecture the parks are wonderful 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.880
 so if you got a little focus on it 

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:49.350
 You will see that we live well 

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.080
 in the wonderful city 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:54.810
 and that space is exactly that or 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:58.409
 a homage to our city in the sense 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:00.510
 to value our attention 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:02.340
 we Brazilian Brazilians that we 

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:04.909
 world but we live in a city 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:07.409
 wonderful powerful and rich 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:09.569
 architecturally speaking I'll see that 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:11.430
 often goes unnoticed by people 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:14.640
 in this our troubled day in São Paulo 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:17.170
 works a lot so many people repair 

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:19.840
 which has wonderful beaches 

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:23.050
 wonderful wonderful part then 

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:24.730
 this space here is a space that tries to 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:26.890
 to honor our city 

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:31.239
 You'll notice that he's all one. 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:33.670
 worked the neutral element type tones 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:36.250
 Neutral white ash because I wanted 

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:38.380
 to call the focus of the person who 

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:41.890
 I came here to the beautiful city 

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:45.010
 city ​​for a beauty the city will stop 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:47.400
 here the furniture is of simple design 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.400
 minimalist 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:56.440
 the fabrics are neutral in color and yes 

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:58.810
 More important would be the enhancement of 

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:00.790
 urban perspective or to value 

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:03.430
 our city that many people of the 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.650
 back and also completing this 

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:08.739
 scenery the duty of homage to our 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:11.950
 city ​​and I put some works of 

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:14.049
 arts that we value and work 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:17.380
 architectural model of the city for 

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:19.480
 sef photos accompanying the project 

00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:21.160

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.829
 people have passed by but do not see 

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:26.769
 that the product that her tauá drawing 

00:03:23.829 --> 00:03:30.400
 wonderful simple minimalist 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:32.650
 a wonderful dash you notice that in 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:35.620
 several good points and the environment has 

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:37.660
 also the memory of a space that 

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:40.450
 You walk through the city and are not notice 

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:42.400
 very beautiful should be valued yes 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:45.310
 we often go unnoticed 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:47.260
 the repair for nothing that the space is called 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:48.850
 Welcome Sao Paulo, welcome. 

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.680
 Something else I do not understand 

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:54.430
 You used a lot of gray color for 

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:56.500
 that the physical element was neutral 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:58.450
 in the sense of valuing the 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:01.390
 urban perspective, or if I 

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:04.030
 enter with green juice with blue 

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:06.220
 I was beginning to draw attention that our 

00:04:04.030 --> 00:04:08.440
 objective would enhance rather 

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:10.150
 urban perspective then I looked 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:13.870
 work with black elements on the floor 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:16.720
 on the wall in the linings to end on the line 

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:19.539
 people to value my 

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:22.360
