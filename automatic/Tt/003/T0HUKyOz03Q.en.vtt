I<00:00:00.569> was<00:00:01.569> looking<00:00:01.839> to<00:00:01.869> study<00:00:02.200> doing<00:00:02.500> politics<00:00:02.830> in

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:02.950

00:00:04.679 --> 00:00:04.689 
particular because i think the course

00:00:04.689 --> 00:00:07.799 
particular because i think the course
just<00:00:05.049> fits<00:00:05.470> me<00:00:05.620> like<00:00:05.649> a<00:00:05.799> glove<00:00:05.890> I<00:00:06.809> wouldn't

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:07.809 
just fits me like a glove I wouldn't

00:00:07.809 --> 00:00:10.290 
just fits me like a glove I wouldn't
like<00:00:08.050> to<00:00:08.080> do<00:00:08.290> anything<00:00:08.590> else<00:00:08.740> it's<00:00:09.520> it<00:00:09.910> adds<00:00:10.120> a

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:10.300 
like to do anything else it's it adds a

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:14.610 
like to do anything else it's it adds a
bit<00:00:10.450> more<00:00:10.480> diversity<00:00:11.170> to<00:00:11.440> law<00:00:11.670> and<00:00:13.080> in<00:00:14.080> and

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:14.620 
bit more diversity to law and in and

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:16.860 
bit more diversity to law and in and

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:16.870 
this again is my personal opinion it's a

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:19.260 
this again is my personal opinion it's a
far<00:00:17.260> more<00:00:17.830> interesting<00:00:18.340> cause<00:00:18.550> than<00:00:18.880> to

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:19.270 
far more interesting cause than to

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:21.840 
far more interesting cause than to
