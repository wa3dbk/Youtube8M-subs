of them while the others pollo you your
best<00:00:50.730> bet<00:00:50.910> is<00:00:51.030> to<00:00:51.059> let<00:00:51.300> them<00:00:51.450> damage<00:00:51.840> each

other as they charge you but I find that

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.170 
other as they charge you but I find that
also<00:00:55.410> easier<00:00:55.800> and<00:00:56.010> shorter<00:00:56.040> if<00:00:56.610> you<00:00:56.910> just

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:57.180 
also easier and shorter if you just

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.600 
also easier and shorter if you just
enter<00:00:57.720> Berserker<00:00:58.170> mode<00:00:58.200> and<00:00:58.620> do<00:00:59.250> the<00:00:59.370> clothes
