00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:14.510
 hello welcome again in some 

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:16.490
 occasion it may happen that the screen 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:19.070
 tactile of river does not respond at all 

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:21.740
 well lacking speed precision or 

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:23.750
 sensitivity this is solved so 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:25.789
 relatively simple by a 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:28.689
 process known as the calibration of 

00:00:25.789 --> 00:00:28.689
 a capacitive screen 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:36.989
 this calibration is nothing more than 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.550
 readjust the original values of the 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:40.860
 screen to recover a 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.720
 optimal performance something that just 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:46.340
 lasts a few seconds and that is convenient 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.340
 make from time to time 

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:53.839
 i 

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.879
 press first and form 

00:00:53.839 --> 00:00:59.329
 continued on the advance button of 

00:00:55.879 --> 00:01:01.489
 page pressure a few seconds the button 

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:03.500
 on and off and keep pressing the 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:06.440
 page advance even while the 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.560
 reader restarts 

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.560
 to 

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.930
 to 

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:23.530
 ah 

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:41.060
 to make these adjustments the ereader 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.100
 it must be completely off 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.350
 calibration will start automatically 

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.580
 let him take his time and press the 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:49.160
 box that confirms you in the 

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:51.350
 completion of the process the system te 

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:53.510
 will return to the home screen ready 

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:56.410
 so you can start using your bq leader with 

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:56.410
 total normality 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:01:59.530
 i 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.840
 how do you see something as quick as practical 

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:07.590
 a greeting of returns with us always 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.590
 that you need it
