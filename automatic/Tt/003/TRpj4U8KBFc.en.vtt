00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:46.830 
and I draw any tile to replace it and

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:48.590 
and I draw any tile to replace it and
then<00:01:46.979> the<00:01:47.070> next<00:01:47.100> player<00:01:47.430> plays<00:01:47.759> something

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:48.600 
then the next player plays something

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.060 
then the next player plays something
like<00:01:48.810> that<00:01:48.990> maybe<00:01:49.170> he's<00:01:49.380> going<00:01:49.619> for<00:01:49.740> robots

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
and then the next player maybe plays

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.040 
and then the next player maybe plays
this<00:01:52.020> and<00:01:52.290> he's<00:01:53.130> going<00:01:53.460> for<00:01:53.820> pirates<00:01:54.570> now

the<00:02:15.630> basis<00:02:16.170> that<00:02:16.200> we<00:02:16.380> saw<00:02:16.680> earlier<00:02:16.830> are<00:02:17.310> worth

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030 
the basis that we saw earlier are worth

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.660 
the basis that we saw earlier are worth
five<00:02:18.390> points<00:02:18.690> for<00:02:18.930> each<00:02:19.110> but<00:02:19.739> HMU<00:02:20.070> has<00:02:20.280> an<00:02:20.430> arch

five points for each but HMU has an arch

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.490 
five points for each but HMU has an arch
enemy<00:02:21.209> so<00:02:21.600> if<00:02:21.690> you<00:02:21.750> think<00:02:21.989> the<00:02:22.110> time<00:02:22.260> that<00:02:22.440> I

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
enemy so if you think the time that I

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.080 
enemy so if you think the time that I
just<00:02:22.650> dropped<00:02:22.920> here<00:02:23.220> has<00:02:23.610> both<00:02:23.880> the<00:02:24.000> military

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.090 
just dropped here has both the military

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:27.410 
just dropped here has both the military
and<00:02:24.510> the<00:02:25.350> hunter<00:02:25.680> so<00:02:26.280> if<00:02:26.489> this<00:02:26.670> tile<00:02:26.970> for

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:27.420 
and the hunter so if this tile for

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:29.570 
and the hunter so if this tile for
example<00:02:27.780> the<00:02:28.110> military<00:02:28.590> is<00:02:28.830> an<00:02:28.980> archenemy<00:02:29.400> of

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:29.580 
example the military is an archenemy of

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.229 
example the military is an archenemy of
a<00:02:29.970> robot<00:02:30.420> so<00:02:30.959> if<00:02:31.320> there<00:02:31.799> was<00:02:31.980> a<00:02:32.010> robot<00:02:32.370> here<00:02:33.060> and

00:02:33.229 --> 00:02:33.239 
a robot so if there was a robot here and

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:35.020 
a robot so if there was a robot here and
the<00:02:33.390> archenemies<00:02:33.720> put<00:02:34.170> together<00:02:34.320> next<00:02:34.620> to<00:02:34.799> it

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:35.030 
the archenemies put together next to it

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.699 
the archenemies put together next to it
this<00:02:36.030> is<00:02:36.239> no<00:02:36.480> these<00:02:36.930> are<00:02:37.049> no<00:02:37.170> points<00:02:37.500> because

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
this is no these are no points because

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:39.680 
this is no these are no points because
the<00:02:37.830> military<00:02:38.250> is<00:02:38.340> touching<00:02:38.640> it<00:02:38.760> conversely

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
the military is touching it conversely

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.370 
the military is touching it conversely
if<00:02:40.140> the<00:02:41.150> hunter<00:02:42.150> was<00:02:42.420> touching<00:02:42.780> the<00:02:42.959> zombie

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:43.380 
if the hunter was touching the zombie

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:45.110 
if the hunter was touching the zombie
this<00:02:43.650> is<00:02:43.799> worth<00:02:43.950> no<00:02:44.160> points<00:02:44.489> because<00:02:44.760> it's<00:02:44.940> its

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
this is worth no points because it's its

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.170 
this is worth no points because it's its
arch<00:02:45.330> enemy<00:02:45.930> the<00:02:46.110> arch<00:02:46.980> enemies<00:02:47.340> also<00:02:47.549> block

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:48.180 
arch enemy the arch enemies also block

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.050 
arch enemy the arch enemies also block
the<00:02:48.630> special<00:02:49.580> characters<00:02:50.580> there<00:02:50.760> the<00:02:50.880> point

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
the special characters there the point

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.340 
the special characters there the point
so<00:02:51.239> if<00:02:51.299> the<00:02:51.420> robots<00:02:51.780> they<00:02:51.930> were<00:02:52.049> like<00:02:52.260> the

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:52.350 
so if the robots they were like the

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:53.960 
so if the robots they were like the
batteries<00:02:52.739> but<00:02:53.459> they<00:02:53.640> don't<00:02:53.790> like<00:02:53.880> the

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:53.970 
batteries but they don't like the

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:55.430 
batteries but they don't like the
military<00:02:54.299> so<00:02:54.420> this<00:02:54.570> actually<00:02:54.720> canceled<00:02:55.320> that

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
military so this actually canceled that

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.009 
military so this actually canceled that
out<00:02:55.620> as<00:02:55.799> well<00:02:56.120> now<00:02:57.120> when<00:02:57.239> placing<00:02:57.600> basis<00:02:57.930> or

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019 
out as well now when placing basis or

00:02:58.019 --> 00:02:59.750 
out as well now when placing basis or
any<00:02:58.170> tiles<00:02:58.440> for<00:02:58.650> that<00:02:58.739> matter<00:02:58.920> this<00:02:59.489> is<00:02:59.610> my

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
any tiles for that matter this is my

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.789 
any tiles for that matter this is my
ninja<00:03:00.090> base<00:03:00.269> I<00:03:00.450> couldn't<00:03:00.840> put<00:03:00.989> any<00:03:01.200> tile<00:03:01.530> here

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:01.799 
ninja base I couldn't put any tile here

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:03.860 
ninja base I couldn't put any tile here
because<00:03:02.130> this<00:03:02.610> is<00:03:02.760> a<00:03:02.790> separate<00:03:03.150> tile<00:03:03.360> and<00:03:03.690> they

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
because this is a separate tile and they

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:05.569 
because this is a separate tile and they
that's<00:03:04.350> not<00:03:04.620> there<00:03:04.799> you<00:03:04.950> always<00:03:05.130> have<00:03:05.310> to<00:03:05.430> line

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:05.579 
that's not there you always have to line

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:07.069 
that's not there you always have to line
it<00:03:05.610> up<00:03:05.760> exactly<00:03:06.239> with<00:03:06.360> an<00:03:06.510> edge<00:03:06.720> of<00:03:06.870> another

00:03:07.069 --> 00:03:07.079 
it up exactly with an edge of another

00:03:07.079 --> 00:03:08.750 
it up exactly with an edge of another
tile<00:03:07.320> so<00:03:07.890> I<00:03:07.920> couldn't<00:03:08.160> place<00:03:08.220> it<00:03:08.310> there<00:03:08.549> but<00:03:08.700> I

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
tile so I couldn't place it there but I

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.330 
tile so I couldn't place it there but I
could<00:03:08.940> place<00:03:09.120> it<00:03:09.150> here<00:03:09.660> and<00:03:10.320> so<00:03:10.860> we're<00:03:11.070> here

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
could place it here and so we're here

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:12.830 
could place it here and so we're here
let's<00:03:11.549> say<00:03:11.730> the<00:03:11.850> basis<00:03:12.120> the<00:03:12.420> base<00:03:12.540> is<00:03:12.660> worth

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:12.840 
let's say the basis the base is worth

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.090 
let's say the basis the base is worth
five<00:03:12.989> points<00:03:13.200> at<00:03:13.440> the<00:03:13.530> end<00:03:13.620> of<00:03:13.769> the<00:03:13.829> game<00:03:13.860> if

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:14.100 
five points at the end of the game if

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.190 
five points at the end of the game if
this<00:03:14.220> was<00:03:14.370> my<00:03:14.489> largest<00:03:14.910> ninja<00:03:15.720> and<00:03:15.930> I<00:03:15.989> was<00:03:16.110> the

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
this was my largest ninja and I was the

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.470 
this was my largest ninja and I was the

eleven<00:03:18.840> twelve<00:03:18.959> points<00:03:20.269> now<00:03:21.269> sometimes<00:03:21.810> you

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:21.870 
eleven twelve points now sometimes you

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:23.060 
eleven twelve points now sometimes you
can<00:03:21.989> play<00:03:22.079> tiles<00:03:22.320> I<00:03:22.410> have<00:03:22.530> special<00:03:23.010> abilities

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.070 
can play tiles I have special abilities

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:26.000 
can play tiles I have special abilities
this<00:03:24.060> tile<00:03:24.269> here<00:03:24.450> has<00:03:24.660> a<00:03:24.690> rotate<00:03:25.290> I<00:03:25.500> could

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
this tile here has a rotate I could

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:27.370 
this tile here has a rotate I could
place<00:03:26.370> this

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:27.380 
place this

00:03:27.380 --> 00:03:29.930 
place this
like<00:03:28.380> this<00:03:28.650> and<00:03:28.950> this<00:03:29.340> would<00:03:29.490> allow<00:03:29.670> me<00:03:29.819> to

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940 
like this and this would allow me to

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.300 
like this and this would allow me to
rotate<00:03:30.390> any<00:03:30.630> tile<00:03:30.990> that's<00:03:31.140> already<00:03:31.410> placed<00:03:31.740> so

00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:32.310 
rotate any tile that's already placed so

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:34.640 
rotate any tile that's already placed so
let's<00:03:32.490> say<00:03:32.580> I<00:03:32.730> place<00:03:33.000> that<00:03:33.240> fair<00:03:33.510> and<00:03:34.290> then<00:03:34.620> I

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:34.650 
let's say I place that fair and then I

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:40.370 
let's say I place that fair and then I
rotate<00:03:35.220> this<00:03:35.400> like<00:03:36.360> that<00:03:38.360> now<00:03:39.360> some<00:03:39.750> cards<00:03:40.200> let

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380 
rotate this like that now some cards let

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:41.600 
rotate this like that now some cards let
me<00:03:40.470> do<00:03:40.590> sometimes<00:03:41.160> let<00:03:41.280> me<00:03:41.370> do<00:03:41.459> something

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:41.610 
me do sometimes let me do something

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:43.880 
me do sometimes let me do something
special<00:03:42.000> now<00:03:42.569> this<00:03:42.690> is<00:03:42.750> a<00:03:42.870> rotate<00:03:43.319> when<00:03:43.739> you

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:43.890 
special now this is a rotate when you

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:45.170 
special now this is a rotate when you
shouldn't<00:03:44.130> rotate<00:03:44.400> you<00:03:44.489> can<00:03:44.640> rotate<00:03:44.940> any

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:45.180 
shouldn't rotate you can rotate any

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:46.729 
shouldn't rotate you can rotate any
other<00:03:45.420> title<00:03:45.660> in<00:03:45.810> the<00:03:45.900> game<00:03:46.140> it<00:03:46.290> doesn't<00:03:46.440> have

00:03:46.729 --> 00:03:46.739 
other title in the game it doesn't have

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:48.020 
other title in the game it doesn't have
to<00:03:46.830> be<00:03:46.860> touching<00:03:47.280> this<00:03:47.430> it<00:03:47.580> can<00:03:47.700> be<00:03:47.760> anywhere

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:48.030 
to be touching this it can be anywhere

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:50.210 
to be touching this it can be anywhere
on<00:03:48.150> the<00:03:48.239> board<00:03:48.480> you<00:03:49.260> can<00:03:49.380> rotate<00:03:49.560> any<00:03:49.830> tile<00:03:50.040> so

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
on the board you can rotate any tile so

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.070 
on the board you can rotate any tile so
I<00:03:50.280> can<00:03:50.430> just<00:03:50.550> take<00:03:50.700> this<00:03:50.819> one<00:03:50.880> and<00:03:51.060> rotate<00:03:51.989> like

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.080 
I can just take this one and rotate like

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:53.600 
I can just take this one and rotate like
that<00:03:52.290> so<00:03:52.410> the<00:03:52.500> Pirates<00:03:52.680> are<00:03:52.980> cut<00:03:53.280> off<00:03:53.310> right

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
that so the Pirates are cut off right

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:56.690 
that so the Pirates are cut off right
there<00:03:53.850> if<00:03:54.600> I<00:03:54.750> play<00:03:54.959> this<00:03:55.319> one<00:03:55.590> it<00:03:55.800> has<00:03:55.920> a<00:03:55.950> swap

00:03:56.690 --> 00:03:56.700 
there if I play this one it has a swap

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:58.490 
there if I play this one it has a swap
so<00:03:57.270> I'll<00:03:57.360> plate<00:03:57.540> is<00:03:57.660> here<00:03:57.840> allows<00:03:58.020> me<00:03:58.110> to<00:03:58.230> swap

00:03:58.490 --> 00:03:58.500 
so I'll plate is here allows me to swap

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.009 
so I'll plate is here allows me to swap
and<00:03:58.680> rotate<00:03:59.040> any<00:03:59.280> two<00:03:59.700> tiles<00:03:59.970> on<00:04:00.209> the<00:04:00.239> game<00:04:00.300> so

00:04:01.009 --> 00:04:01.019 
and rotate any two tiles on the game so

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:02.840 
and rotate any two tiles on the game so
these<00:04:01.260> dragons<00:04:01.800> are<00:04:01.950> the<00:04:02.040> arch<00:04:02.250> enemies<00:04:02.700> of

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:02.850 
these dragons are the arch enemies of

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:05.210 
these dragons are the arch enemies of
the<00:04:03.000> ninjas<00:04:03.570> so<00:04:03.720> it<00:04:03.840> does<00:04:04.350> no<00:04:04.680> longer<00:04:04.709> scores

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:05.220 
the ninjas so it does no longer scores

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.040 
the ninjas so it does no longer scores
that<00:04:05.400> one<00:04:05.550> and<00:04:05.910> then<00:04:05.970> I'll<00:04:06.209> take<00:04:06.390> this<00:04:06.570> one<00:04:06.630> and

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:07.050 
that one and then I'll take this one and

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:09.410 
that one and then I'll take this one and
this<00:04:07.739> one<00:04:07.800> I<00:04:08.010> can<00:04:08.340> move<00:04:08.550> it<00:04:08.670> and<00:04:08.820> rotate<00:04:09.209> them

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
this one I can move it and rotate them

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.650 
this one I can move it and rotate them
any<00:04:09.660> way<00:04:10.050> I<00:04:10.080> see<00:04:10.170> fit<00:04:10.380> and<00:04:10.709> that's<00:04:10.980> the<00:04:11.220> swap

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:11.660 
any way I see fit and that's the swap

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:16.460 
any way I see fit and that's the swap
the<00:04:12.660> last<00:04:12.930> type<00:04:13.290> is<00:04:13.640> a<00:04:14.640> put<00:04:15.269> down<00:04:15.510> and<00:04:15.900> remove

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
the last type is a put down and remove

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:19.190 
the last type is a put down and remove
type<00:04:17.070> of<00:04:17.269> action<00:04:18.269> I<00:04:18.419> want<00:04:18.780> to<00:04:18.810> do<00:04:18.900> that<00:04:18.930> I<00:04:19.049> could

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:19.200 
type of action I want to do that I could

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:21.050 
type of action I want to do that I could
take<00:04:19.350> any<00:04:19.560> tile<00:04:19.919> off<00:04:20.100> the<00:04:20.220> board<00:04:20.459> except<00:04:20.910> a

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:21.060 
take any tile off the board except a

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.180 
take any tile off the board except a
base<00:04:21.419> so<00:04:22.290> maybe<00:04:22.440> I<00:04:22.590> take<00:04:22.800> this<00:04:22.950> one<00:04:23.160> off

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190 
base so maybe I take this one off

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:26.030 
base so maybe I take this one off
because<00:04:23.580> I<00:04:23.669> like<00:04:23.910> robots<00:04:24.390> and<00:04:24.690> i<00:04:25.650> can<00:04:25.800> replace

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:26.040 
because I like robots and i can replace

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:27.890 
because I like robots and i can replace
it<00:04:26.220> with<00:04:26.310> anything<00:04:26.790> from<00:04:27.150> my<00:04:27.330> hand<00:04:27.630> and<00:04:27.750> maybe

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 
it with anything from my hand and maybe

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.170 
it with anything from my hand and maybe
I<00:04:27.990> replaced<00:04:28.290> that<00:04:28.380> because<00:04:28.770> i<00:04:28.889> want<00:04:29.180> the

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:30.180 
I replaced that because i want the

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:33.020 
I replaced that because i want the
robots<00:04:30.510> there<00:04:31.340> now<00:04:32.340> at<00:04:32.550> the<00:04:32.640> beginning<00:04:32.910> of<00:04:32.940> the

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.030 
robots there now at the beginning of the

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:34.969 
robots there now at the beginning of the
game<00:04:33.120> let's<00:04:33.390> say<00:04:33.479> maybe<00:04:33.660> I<00:04:33.750> put<00:04:33.960> my<00:04:34.080> robot<00:04:34.500> base

00:04:34.969 --> 00:04:34.979 
game let's say maybe I put my robot base

00:04:34.979 --> 00:04:37.940 
game let's say maybe I put my robot base
here<00:04:35.550> now<00:04:36.479> for<00:04:36.750> a<00:04:36.780> turn<00:04:37.020> instead<00:04:37.320> of<00:04:37.500> placing<00:04:37.710> a

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:37.950 
here now for a turn instead of placing a

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:40.060 
here now for a turn instead of placing a
tile<00:04:38.190> you<00:04:38.400> can<00:04:38.520> just<00:04:38.760> simply<00:04:39.060> move<00:04:39.330> your<00:04:39.570> base

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:40.070 
tile you can just simply move your base

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:42.560 
tile you can just simply move your base
so<00:04:41.070> maybe<00:04:41.220> I'll<00:04:41.370> take<00:04:41.490> this<00:04:41.610> base<00:04:41.850> and<00:04:42.479> I'll

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:42.570 
so maybe I'll take this base and I'll

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:44.420 
so maybe I'll take this base and I'll
move<00:04:42.660> it<00:04:42.780> over<00:04:42.840> here<00:04:42.990> to<00:04:43.560> now<00:04:43.650> start<00:04:43.890> working

00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:44.430 
move it over here to now start working

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:45.650 
move it over here to now start working
on<00:04:44.520> this<00:04:44.640> end<00:04:44.820> because<00:04:45.000> maybe<00:04:45.150> I<00:04:45.240> got<00:04:45.360> cut<00:04:45.630> off

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:45.660 
on this end because maybe I got cut off

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.650 
on this end because maybe I got cut off
over<00:04:46.110> here<00:04:46.320> and<00:04:46.890> this<00:04:47.789> will<00:04:47.970> continue<00:04:48.240> to<00:04:48.539> the

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:48.660 
over here and this will continue to the

00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:50.510 
over here and this will continue to the
last<00:04:48.990> tile<00:04:49.289> is<00:04:49.470> drawn<00:04:49.770> when<00:04:50.070> that<00:04:50.220> happens

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:50.520 
last tile is drawn when that happens

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:51.890 
last tile is drawn when that happens
everybody<00:04:50.700> else<00:04:50.940> everybody<00:04:51.060> gets<00:04:51.510> one<00:04:51.720> more

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900 
everybody else everybody gets one more

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:53.450 
everybody else everybody gets one more
turn<00:04:52.140> and<00:04:52.350> at<00:04:52.650> the<00:04:52.770> end<00:04:52.950> you<00:04:53.010> then<00:04:53.250> I'm<00:04:53.340> going

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:53.460 
turn and at the end you then I'm going

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.340 
turn and at the end you then I'm going
to<00:04:53.520> find<00:04:53.700> your<00:04:53.910> largest<00:04:54.360> group<00:04:54.750> the<00:04:55.200> one

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:55.350 
to find your largest group the one

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:56.330 
to find your largest group the one
that's<00:04:55.500> going<00:04:55.590> to<00:04:55.680> score<00:04:55.800> you<00:04:55.919> though<00:04:56.010> not<00:04:56.310> the

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:56.340 
that's going to score you though not the

00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:57.500 
that's going to score you though not the
largest<00:04:56.550> group<00:04:56.820> the<00:04:56.970> ones<00:04:57.090> kind<00:04:57.240> of<00:04:57.300> score<00:04:57.450> you

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:57.510 
largest group the ones kind of score you

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:58.850 
largest group the ones kind of score you
the<00:04:57.600> most<00:04:57.810> points<00:04:58.200> sometimes<00:04:58.500> it's<00:04:58.770> not

00:04:58.850 --> 00:04:58.860 
the most points sometimes it's not

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:01.010 
the most points sometimes it's not
always<00:04:58.919> a<00:04:59.130> largest<00:04:59.460> group<00:04:59.610> whatever<00:05:00.210> area<00:05:00.900> is

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:01.020 
always a largest group whatever area is

00:05:01.020 --> 00:05:02.420 
always a largest group whatever area is
going<00:05:01.080> to<00:05:01.169> scroll<00:05:01.470> you<00:05:01.590> the<00:05:01.740> most<00:05:02.010> points

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:02.430 
going to scroll you the most points

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:04.610 
going to scroll you the most points
that's<00:05:03.120> your<00:05:03.300> that's<00:05:03.539> your<00:05:03.750> one<00:05:03.990> point<00:05:04.380> total

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:04.620 
that's your that's your one point total

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:06.170 
that's your that's your one point total
for<00:05:04.740> the<00:05:04.800> game<00:05:04.979> now<00:05:05.460> the<00:05:05.520> board<00:05:05.880> would<00:05:06.030> be<00:05:06.150> a

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:06.180 
for the game now the board would be a

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:08.180 
for the game now the board would be a
lot<00:05:06.570> bigger<00:05:06.780> than<00:05:07.020> this<00:05:07.200> but<00:05:07.740> to<00:05:07.830> keep<00:05:07.950> it<00:05:08.070> on

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:08.190 
lot bigger than this but to keep it on

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:10.010 
lot bigger than this but to keep it on
film<00:05:08.490> here<00:05:08.760> let's<00:05:09.390> say<00:05:09.479> I<00:05:09.539> was<00:05:09.660> the<00:05:09.690> ninjas

00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:10.020 
film here let's say I was the ninjas
