00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:20.970 
between the clouds and the Sun if you

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.620 
between the clouds and the Sun if you
know<00:00:21.119> what<00:00:21.300> I<00:00:21.330> mean<00:00:21.449> like<00:00:22.140> the<00:00:22.710> Sun<00:00:23.010> it<00:00:23.340> is

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:23.630 
know what I mean like the Sun it is

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.150 
know what I mean like the Sun it is
about<00:00:24.630> to<00:00:24.810> come<00:00:24.930> out<00:00:25.080> but<00:00:25.380> it<00:00:25.500> goes<00:00:25.650> in<00:00:25.920> because

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:26.160 
about to come out but it goes in because

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:28.370 
about to come out but it goes in because
the<00:00:26.250> clouds<00:00:26.460> cover<00:00:26.820> it<00:00:27.029> and<00:00:27.300> all<00:00:28.019> that<00:00:28.230> stuff
