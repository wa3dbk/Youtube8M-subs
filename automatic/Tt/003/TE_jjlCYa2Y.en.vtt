00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.410 
you prefer and the dairy milk is for the
topping<00:00:41.010> so<00:00:41.489> first<00:00:41.730> of<00:00:41.879> all<00:00:41.940> why<00:00:42.090> they<00:00:42.239> say<00:00:42.390> I

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
topping so first of all why they say I

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.420 
topping so first of all why they say I
just<00:00:42.600> mix<00:00:42.930> the<00:00:43.110> ingredients<00:00:43.140> together<00:00:43.710> takes

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
just mix the ingredients together takes

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.220 
just mix the ingredients together takes
a<00:00:44.550> while<00:00:44.730> for<00:00:44.760> it<00:00:45.030> to<00:00:45.059> look<00:00:45.239> like<00:00:45.300> this<00:00:45.629> but<00:00:46.110> you

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:46.230 
a while for it to look like this but you

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.840 
a while for it to look like this but you
need<00:00:46.350> to<00:00:46.440> go<00:00:46.530> to<00:00:46.559> the<00:00:46.739> consistency<00:00:47.489> of<00:00:47.520> kind<00:00:47.789> of

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
need to go to the consistency of kind of

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.180 
need to go to the consistency of kind of
play<00:00:48.149> dough<00:00:48.420> roll<00:00:49.200> the<00:00:49.350> mixture<00:00:49.440> into<00:00:49.860> balls

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
play dough roll the mixture into balls

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.979 
play dough roll the mixture into balls
and<00:00:50.489> press<00:00:50.760> them<00:00:50.940> into<00:00:51.149> your<00:00:51.390> cupcake<00:00:51.750> cases

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
and press them into your cupcake cases

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:53.900 
and press them into your cupcake cases
I'd<00:00:52.620> recommend<00:00:52.920> that<00:00:53.100> you<00:00:53.190> use<00:00:53.250> foil<00:00:53.579> ones

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
I'd recommend that you use foil ones

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.160 
I'd recommend that you use foil ones
because<00:00:54.210> they<00:00:54.300> do<00:00:54.360> hold<00:00:54.660> up<00:00:54.780> a<00:00:54.870> little<00:00:55.079> bit

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
because they do hold up a little bit

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.930 
because they do hold up a little bit
better<00:00:55.289> and<00:00:55.620> there<00:00:55.980> is<00:00:56.070> no<00:00:56.280> cooking<00:00:56.670> involved

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
better and there is no cooking involved

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.700 
better and there is no cooking involved
here<00:00:57.270> so<00:00:57.719> next<00:00:57.899> I'm<00:00:58.140> breaking<00:00:58.500> up<00:00:58.559> my

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
here so next I'm breaking up my

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.950 
here so next I'm breaking up my
chocolate<00:00:59.100> to<00:00:59.430> make<00:00:59.879> the<00:01:00.059> topping<00:01:00.270> I<00:01:00.600> just

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
chocolate to make the topping I just

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.180 
chocolate to make the topping I just
melt<00:01:01.170> the<00:01:01.260> chocolate<00:01:01.410> in<00:01:01.620> a<00:01:01.800> little<00:01:02.039> plastic

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
melt the chocolate in a little plastic

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.969 
melt the chocolate in a little plastic
pan<00:01:02.609> and<00:01:02.850> put<00:01:03.660> it<00:01:03.780> on<00:01:03.870> top<00:01:03.899> that<00:01:04.589> is<00:01:04.739> basically

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
pan and put it on top that is basically

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:07.399 
pan and put it on top that is basically
it<00:01:05.760> if<00:01:06.180> you<00:01:06.630> are<00:01:06.720> not<00:01:06.900> going<00:01:07.080> to<00:01:07.170> do<00:01:07.229> anything

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
it if you are not going to do anything

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:08.929 
it if you are not going to do anything
else<00:01:07.590> to<00:01:07.860> them<00:01:07.979> if<00:01:08.100> you<00:01:08.189> just<00:01:08.400> want<00:01:08.549> to<00:01:08.640> make

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
else to them if you just want to make

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.550 
else to them if you just want to make
them<00:01:09.150> with<00:01:09.360> chocolate<00:01:09.390> topping<00:01:09.930> on<00:01:10.140> top<00:01:10.170> and

them with chocolate topping on top and

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.700 
them with chocolate topping on top and
that's<00:01:10.799> it<00:01:11.340> is<00:01:11.670> the<00:01:11.970> simplest<00:01:12.479> recipe<00:01:12.780> ever<00:01:13.290> I

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
that's it is the simplest recipe ever I

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.380 
that's it is the simplest recipe ever I
would<00:01:14.520> then<00:01:14.640> put<00:01:14.790> them<00:01:14.909> in<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.090> fridge<00:01:15.330> to

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:15.390 
would then put them in the fridge to

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.810 
would then put them in the fridge to
cool<00:01:15.930> i<00:01:16.229> like<00:01:16.650> to<00:01:16.799> set<00:01:17.009> the<00:01:17.130> topping<00:01:17.490> because<00:01:17.700> i

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
cool i like to set the topping because i

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:19.550 
cool i like to set the topping because i
am<00:01:17.939> going<00:01:18.090> to<00:01:18.150> decorate<00:01:18.330> them<00:01:18.720> but<00:01:19.380> even<00:01:19.470> if

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:19.560 
am going to decorate them but even if

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:20.450 
am going to decorate them but even if
you're<00:01:19.710> not<00:01:19.740> going<00:01:19.920> to<00:01:19.979> decorate<00:01:20.130> them<00:01:20.400> i'd

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
you're not going to decorate them i'd

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:21.499 
you're not going to decorate them i'd
still<00:01:20.640> recommend<00:01:20.759> you<00:01:21.090> put<00:01:21.210> them<00:01:21.360> in<00:01:21.420> the

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
still recommend you put them in the

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:22.490 
still recommend you put them in the
fridge<00:01:21.659> because<00:01:21.900> it's<00:01:22.080> going<00:01:22.170> to<00:01:22.229> be<00:01:22.320> really

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
fridge because it's going to be really

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.130 
fridge because it's going to be really
messy<00:01:22.710> to<00:01:22.950> eat<00:01:23.070> otherwise<00:01:23.610> i<00:01:23.970> decided<00:01:24.900> to<00:01:24.990> do<00:01:25.110> a

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
messy to eat otherwise i decided to do a

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:26.840 
messy to eat otherwise i decided to do a
cobweb<00:01:25.500> design<00:01:26.040> on<00:01:26.280> top<00:01:26.310> i<00:01:26.520> thought<00:01:26.759> would

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
cobweb design on top i thought would

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:28.219 
cobweb design on top i thought would
lend<00:01:27.060> itself<00:01:27.299> really<00:01:27.540> well<00:01:27.630> for<00:01:27.869> halloween

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
lend itself really well for halloween

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.039 
lend itself really well for halloween
but<00:01:28.920> i<00:01:28.979> was<00:01:29.159> using<00:01:29.369> this<00:01:29.759> strange<00:01:30.329> kind<00:01:30.570> of<00:01:30.689> can

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
but i was using this strange kind of can

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.440 
but i was using this strange kind of can
of<00:01:31.380> frosting<00:01:32.130> for<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:32.700> first<00:01:32.909> time<00:01:33.150> and<00:01:33.390> it

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
of frosting for the first time and it

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:34.910 
of frosting for the first time and it
was<00:01:33.540> actually<00:01:33.630> really<00:01:34.079> difficult<00:01:34.259> to<00:01:34.650> control

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
was actually really difficult to control

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.010 
was actually really difficult to control
this<00:01:35.460> is<00:01:35.640> probably<00:01:35.850> the<00:01:36.060> best<00:01:36.390> take<00:01:36.689> that<00:01:36.960> i

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
this is probably the best take that i

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:39.289 
this is probably the best take that i
did<00:01:37.259> there<00:01:37.680> were<00:01:37.770> some<00:01:37.920> really<00:01:38.040> messy<00:01:38.369> ones<00:01:38.549> so

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
did there were some really messy ones so

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:40.730 
did there were some really messy ones so
i<00:01:39.360> would<00:01:39.570> recommend<00:01:40.020> maybe<00:01:40.290> getting<00:01:40.560> those

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
i would recommend maybe getting those

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.830 
i would recommend maybe getting those
little<00:01:40.979> squeezy<00:01:41.280> tubes<00:01:41.579> or<00:01:41.880> just<00:01:42.420> doing<00:01:42.570> it

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:42.840 
little squeezy tubes or just doing it

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.569 
little squeezy tubes or just doing it
with<00:01:43.110> a<00:01:43.140> regular<00:01:43.350> piping<00:01:43.920> bag<00:01:44.100> this<00:01:44.430> was

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
with a regular piping bag this was

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:46.490 
with a regular piping bag this was
really<00:01:44.790> difficult<00:01:44.939> and<00:01:45.390> but<00:01:46.140> yeah<00:01:46.259> that's

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
really difficult and but yeah that's

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:48.770 
really difficult and but yeah that's
pretty<00:01:46.860> much<00:01:47.040> it<00:01:47.100> you<00:01:47.430> could<00:01:47.640> ice<00:01:48.390> them

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
pretty much it you could ice them

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:49.940 
pretty much it you could ice them
however<00:01:48.930> you<00:01:49.170> want<00:01:49.200> it<00:01:49.470> so<00:01:49.619> you<00:01:49.680> could<00:01:49.799> use

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
however you want it so you could use

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:51.920 
however you want it so you could use
them<00:01:50.100> for<00:01:50.250> whatever<00:01:50.460> occasion<00:01:50.820> you<00:01:51.479> so<00:01:51.689> wished

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:51.930 
them for whatever occasion you so wished

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:53.480 
them for whatever occasion you so wished
could<00:01:52.470> make<00:01:52.590> them<00:01:52.710> for<00:01:52.829> christmas<00:01:53.189> you<00:01:53.220> could

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490
