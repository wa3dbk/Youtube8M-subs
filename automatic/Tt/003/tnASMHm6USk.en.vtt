00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 so more friends how to set 

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:05.520
 Welcome back to our channel 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.470
 Today we are going to show you how to move 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.139
 applications of the internal memory of the 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.389
 micro sd whenever possible in 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:16.109
 a phone that has not been cordial 

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:18.779
 here we have the lg optimus the 5-2 that 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.850
 phone is not surrounded and phones that 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.199
 allow you to move applications to 

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:25.109
 micro SD 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:27.210
 including applications that are allowed or 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.750
 they move automatically in the micro sd 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.980
 when they install themselves and they see that 

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:33.270
 installed the micro sd 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.430
 but before you invite them 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.809
 subscribe to your channel has clicked 

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:38.790
 low and subscribe to your charges 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:40.260
 subscription is completely free and 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.059
 that way to be aware of all 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.079
 our videos and give us questions 

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:45.850
 comments suggestions 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:47.769
 Many people have asked us if it is 

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.019
 possible to move applications from this 

00:00:47.769 --> 00:00:52.449
 phone licks grow up here we're going to 

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:55.089
 respond with this with this one in a life 

00:00:52.449 --> 00:00:57.609
 answer with this video phone is not 

00:00:55.089 --> 00:01:00.010
 you have rooted if it is not 

00:00:57.609 --> 00:01:02.049
 possible because ruth would have to do the 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:04.180
 phone we already made the apps 

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:06.220
 using the applications that are 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:08.080
 designed for phones that are 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.240
 surrounded then let's add here 

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:10.929
 the configuration options or 

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.140
 settings 

00:01:10.929 --> 00:01:17.880
 let's find where are adjustments if not 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:20.049
 we are here to adjustments then we are going to 

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.100
 storage or applications rather 

00:01:20.049 --> 00:01:26.500
 let's start with applications and to know 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:29.200
 or to know if an application can be 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:31.990
 move to the micro sd simply enough 

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:35.289
 with entering it and here below it must 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:38.679
 appear this option move to the sd and 

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:42.620
 it has to appear not in gray but in 

00:01:38.679 --> 00:01:44.540
 black is to say allow it to click 

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:46.730
 let's go into angry birds to see if 

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:49.750
 gives us the option here added 

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:51.460
 the option to move to the micro sd 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:52.960
 let's look at the space 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:56.050
 internal storage that we have in 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:58.930
 these moments and the free we have used 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:02.410
 1.1 gigabytes let's start moving 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:05.110
 applications to see if space is released 

00:02:02.410 --> 00:02:07.840
 We are going to move as much as 

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:11.229
 let's have here move to the 

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.229
 and grow 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:17.130
 let's keep moving all the 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:20.280
 we can move to see if we can free 

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:23.630
 internal memory of the device 

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.630
 and grows 

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.530
 Let's see 

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:36.650
 a telephone the most leaves the option of 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.690
 move to the micro sd also comes out 

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:40.190
 moving is to say that there is also 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:45.040
 give you an experience that the phone 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:45.040
 how are these applications automatically 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:59.890
 as in applications that do not weigh much 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:01.750
 Well, we are not going to see the 

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:04.090
 change in the internal space of 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:06.900
 phone but we are already seeing here a 

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.900
 small change 

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:13.600
 remember that I had told you that 

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:16.120
 we had used 1.1 gigabytes already in 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:18.520
 these moments already the situation is 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:21.910
 beginning to change and already at this moment 

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:26.840
 it tells me that I have used a 

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:29.739
 gigabyte is to say that already free 100 megs 

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:32.900
 of memory 100 megabytes is a space 

00:03:29.739 --> 00:03:35.440
 significant is a space where they fit 

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:38.440
 perfectly four applications 

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.440
 big 

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:46.130
 as we can see there are many applications 

00:03:41.430 --> 00:03:46.130
 that can be moved to the micro s 

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.840
 let's keep moving these 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.300
 Applications 

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:57.240
 until at least 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:57.240
 the space used pass 

00:03:58.130 --> 00:04:03.480
 historically the procedure 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:05.880
 It's long but it's worth doing all 

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:09.600
 I have many applications to do it and 

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:15.060
 as you will see here I already passed 1.1 gigabytes 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:16.470
 house at 990 megs we use all I need 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:18.780
 do the same procedure to all 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:20.459
 these applications that would be already task 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:23.100
 for you but basically I already 

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:25.410
 I showed how to pass the applications of 

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:27.390
 internal phone to the micro cm without having 

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:28.560
 that being a root has returned by study 

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:31.910
 thank you very much for watching our videos
