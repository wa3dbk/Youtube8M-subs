00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.040
 convert an alternator to a generator 

00:00:02.689 --> 00:00:07.560
 now we will see how to convert a 

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:10.590
 automotive generator alternator 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:13.200
 electrical first we need a 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:16.440
 Alternator conventional automotive the 

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:19.650
 which we disarm we disarm and follow 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:22.170
 disarming until you get the rotor this 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:25.230
 rotor consists of a shaft core poles 

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.449
 and a sliding circular connector whose 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.640
 function is to feed the coil of 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:32.279
 electromagnet that is inside of 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.829
 the poles of this rotor we remove the 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:36.809
 circular connector and we separate a pole 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:39.570
 of the nucleus that acts as the lid of the 

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.940
 rotating electromagnet however in 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.010
 this example we discovered that a core 

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:46.320
 solid is inadequate for 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:49.180
 modification that we're going to do this 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.550
 it's because you can not disarm 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:53.650
 we repeat the whole procedure again 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:55.720
 with another alternator until you find a 

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:57.880
 rotor in which the core can be 

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:00.430
 separate to replace it with magnets 

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:03.160
 these donut type magnets can be obtained 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:05.199
 of discarded speakers are obtained 

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:08.020
 carefully dividing the part 

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:10.150
 magnetic of the horn we verify that 

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:12.250
 the magnet is the right size and that 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:15.190
 fit inside the magnetic caps of the 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:17.470
 rotor with donut-type magnets in series for 

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:19.240
 complete the thickness of the rotor we proceed 

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:21.250
 to close the assembly so that it 

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.740
 just being careful not to break the 

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:25.690
 magnets rectify the perimeter of the 

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.090
 rotor to eliminate differences in 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:30.490
 sizes and this is achieved by wearing 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.740
 laterally the rotor with a grinder or 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:36.100
 some rotary grinding tool 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:38.470
 metallic has already rectified we assembled 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:40.479
 our generator we verify that the axis 

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.700
 Turn freely before tightening 

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:44.800
 the screws after tightening the 

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.410
 screws again verify that the 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:49.780
 shaft keep turning freely we connect to 

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:52.420
 an oscilloscope and we make a turn to 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.070
 verify the voltage generation now 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.020
 see the second part of this video 

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:58.539
 where we show how to test the 

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:01.450
 with good speed and we generate energy 

00:01:58.539 --> 00:02:03.219
 useful, we remind you to visit the section of
