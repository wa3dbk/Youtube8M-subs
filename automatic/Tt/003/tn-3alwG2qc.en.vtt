00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:20.860
 Hello smartphone screen reader for the visually impaired Shiny the 

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:24.220
 Shainidar is a smartphone screen reader for the visually impaired. 

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:29.130
 Works on Android-based 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:33.610
 Let's briefly explain the behavior of Shainidar. 

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:38.650
 Shainidar runs at the Android os level. 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:42.070
 Designed to use full touch screen based terminals 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:45.519
 What it means to run at the Android os level 

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:50.799
 It is not only available in the measurement program 

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:57.129
 It means you can read and manipulate all apps for Android 

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:58.449
 As a key feature, Shinyer can also be operated on Frettech screens . 

00:00:57.129 --> 00:01:03.159
 It is. 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:08.799
 Because it is usually a touchscreen 2 smooth panel 

00:01:03.159 --> 00:01:12.310
 Visually impaired people can not use certain points because they can not install 

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:17.829
 But how does this work? 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:22.030
 First , let's try a simple experiment to learn about this magical feature. 

00:01:17.829 --> 00:01:29.159
 I 'll close my eyes . 

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:29.159
 Let's hit the fingertips of the left hand in turn with the index finger of the right hand. 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:37.390
 How can I do it? 

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:42.030
 Yes, of course. 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:45.520
 I have eyes, but pointing to your body is not a problem at all. 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:50.620
 Is there anyone who is not good at this ? 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:52.000
 I do not think so. 

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:55.330
 wish 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.840
 Oh, did you notice right already 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:04.240
 This principle has been applied to the shinier 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:07.660
 So let's see the shiny ones now . 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:12.460
 But there is nothing. 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:16.930
 Because Shainie is a screen reader, she does not have her own image. 

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:23.050
 You do not need it because your presence is visible only in silver . 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:27.640
 Shainid is currently reporting that the e-screen is why the virtual keyboard works 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:31.720
 A transparent keyboard is floating on the screen . 

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:36.790
 This transparent keyboard is a new mecca 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:39.850
 That is, when three times four days and is divided into scoring zones 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:44.860
 It's like the star of a phone button. 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:46.600
 Whatever the situation, the touch you are willing to do must be in the twelve partitions 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:48.990
 It's just an area. 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:52.560
 Touch Position 1 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:56.190
 Touch position is touch position 3 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:03:02.100
 The fuzzy touch position 4 Touch position no. 

00:02:56.190 --> 00:03:05.850
 Positions 8 like touch position 6 9 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:12.120
 Touch 4g Awesome 11 12 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:13.740
 So while the shinidis are running, always have a familiar keyboard 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:19.350
 That's right. 

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:20.670
 Now, with your eyes in this state, connect your screen with your right index finger 

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:23.390
 Yes 

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:23.390
 Let's move. 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:32.870
 When I move, I feel vibrations at certain points. 

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:37.060
 This point is the central area 

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:42.459
 That is equivalent to five times the key position of the phone button 

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:46.959
 I feel the vibration at the bottom 0 key position on the bottom. 

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:51.430
 I write here to stop at the center of key five. 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:54.610
 Now , please pay attention to the finger pointing to this key number five . 

00:03:51.430 --> 00:04:00.550
 This finger is part of my own body. 

00:03:54.610 --> 00:04:01.989
 Okay, now , you touch the remaining 11 areas with your left fingers. 

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:07.650
 I'll see. 

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:07.650
 Let's press this key position on the phone button. 

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:15.069
 Well, then, this time, press the number 8 key on the phone button 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:20.979
 I'll see. 

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:26.410
 I can still do it. I'm covering my eyes, but it's not a natural problem. 

00:04:20.979 --> 00:04:28.090
 Know that it is possible, because his right hand fingers search it and support center 

00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:33.280
 can 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:38.680
 We have named the tradition method before you ping this way 

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:44.470
 How about you now? You can use your smartphone now for the visually impaired. 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:47.289
 There is also this way. Let's look at the back of the smartphone. 

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:51.160
 There are twelve holes marked. 

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:54.430
 Among them, the 5th key of the telephone button, the star key 

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:59.500
 Well, the key is bigger. 

00:04:54.430 --> 00:05:01.830
 Because the smartphone cover is a tactile book, the twelve holes 

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:07.710
 Feel 

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:12.500
 Looks back over this time without the support of cattle because the referee points to the screen 

00:05:07.710 --> 00:05:12.500
 Let's connect the 12 touch areas. 

00:05:12.570 --> 00:05:17.460
 It's number five. 

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:22.020
 This im 

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:27.090
 Number eight. Possible. What happened to this? 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:30.080
 4 The other fingers of the groove form and the hint about that position 

00:05:27.090 --> 00:05:30.080
 Because it is giving. 

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:38.319
 We named this as a method that is a real reference 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:41.620
 But there's a question here. 

00:05:38.319 --> 00:05:48.669
 So is it possible only numbers? 

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:53.830
 Numbers as well as Korean-English keys are available for Mr. Yang Yang 

00:05:48.669 --> 00:05:54.969
 If the current floating screen is in the state of selecting an item, 

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:58.719
 Switched 

00:05:54.969 --> 00:06:03.370
 If you enter a character, it changes to a character key 

00:05:58.719 --> 00:06:09.029
 The user simply presses the screen as appropriate 

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:09.029
 The first introduction is always the directional keypad. 

00:06:09.849 --> 00:06:16.869
 If the key is the down arrow key and the up arrow key 10 is the enter key 

00:06:15.639 --> 00:06:21.279
 It functions. 

00:06:16.869 --> 00:06:26.229
 Press the down arrow button to the side 8 key ditch beam getseupni 

00:06:21.279 --> 00:06:27.399
 You can point to the object one by one and see that the object name is read aloud 

00:06:26.229 --> 00:06:35.099
 There is 

00:06:27.399 --> 00:06:35.099
 I'm pointing to the current message box. 

00:06:35.889 --> 00:06:45.659
 4 You can enter characters here 

00:06:39.099 --> 00:06:45.659
 Then press the Enter key in the input window to enter the current character 

00:06:46.230 --> 00:06:54.500
 Oh yes, here I will find the 0 rookie fence and type abc 

00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:54.500
 Ah 

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:09.010
 You can hear the sound as you type. 

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:13.450
 So far, I have studied the operation principle of Shainidar. 

00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:20.230
 Now people with visual impairments can use your smartphone. 

00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:25.210
 Shine Induction Road KakaoTalk Shopping Market Try a lot of apps 

00:07:20.230 --> 00:07:30.730
 Our at- lab is looking for in-kind partners for overseas distribution 

00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:35.380
 I would like to have a good relationship with organizations interested in assistive technology for the blind . 

00:07:30.730 --> 00:07:39.570
