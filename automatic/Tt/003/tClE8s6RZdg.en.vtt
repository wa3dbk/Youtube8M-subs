in<00:00:02.100> this<00:00:02.220> video<00:00:02.460> we're<00:00:02.970> going<00:00:03.120> to<00:00:03.210> talk<00:00:03.449> about

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:03.600 
in this video we're going to talk about

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:06.650 
in this video we're going to talk about
a<00:00:04.410> question<00:00:05.069> that<00:00:05.220> I<00:00:05.250> get<00:00:05.339> asked<00:00:05.850> quite<00:00:06.390> often

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:06.660 
a question that I get asked quite often

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.009 
a question that I get asked quite often
to<00:00:06.899> my<00:00:07.020> job<00:00:07.319> is<00:00:07.730> why<00:00:08.730> doesn't<00:00:09.090> my<00:00:09.630> signal

00:00:10.009 --> 00:00:10.019 
to my job is why doesn't my signal

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:12.470 
to my job is why doesn't my signal
generators<00:00:10.469> output<00:00:10.679> voltage<00:00:11.280> match<00:00:12.059> what<00:00:12.389> I'm

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
generators output voltage match what I'm

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.020 
generators output voltage match what I'm
seeing<00:00:12.780> on<00:00:12.900> my<00:00:12.929> scope<00:00:13.259> why<00:00:13.559> is<00:00:13.620> it<00:00:13.799> wrong<00:00:14.030> well

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
seeing on my scope why is it wrong well

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.750 
seeing on my scope why is it wrong well
there's<00:00:15.210> really<00:00:15.360> two<00:00:15.480> very<00:00:15.990> common<00:00:16.260> answers

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:16.760 
there's really two very common answers

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.910 
there's really two very common answers
and<00:00:17.760> one<00:00:18.510> is<00:00:18.750> that<00:00:18.960> you<00:00:19.260> know<00:00:19.350> a<00:00:19.380> lot<00:00:19.590> of<00:00:19.710> times

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
and one is that you know a lot of times

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.220 
and one is that you know a lot of times
if<00:00:20.609> somebody<00:00:20.640> is<00:00:21.029> new<00:00:21.210> to<00:00:21.330> using<00:00:21.449> a<00:00:21.689> scope<00:00:21.960> that

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
if somebody is new to using a scope that

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.920 
if somebody is new to using a scope that
might<00:00:22.800> have<00:00:22.980> the<00:00:23.189> vertical<00:00:23.580> scale<00:00:24.060> especially

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:24.930 
might have the vertical scale especially

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.109 
might have the vertical scale especially
the<00:00:25.350> probe<00:00:25.590> attenuation<00:00:25.859> set<00:00:26.609> wrong<00:00:26.820> on<00:00:27.029> the

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.119 
the probe attenuation set wrong on the

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.620 
the probe attenuation set wrong on the
scope<00:00:27.420> and<00:00:27.689> a<00:00:28.619> lot<00:00:29.460> of<00:00:29.490> scopes<00:00:29.849> will<00:00:30.210> set<00:00:30.449> this

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
scope and a lot of scopes will set this

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.630 
scope and a lot of scopes will set this
automatically<00:00:31.199> for<00:00:31.320> you<00:00:31.679> if<00:00:32.219> we<00:00:32.309> take<00:00:32.430> a<00:00:32.489> look

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:32.640 
automatically for you if we take a look

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.510 
automatically for you if we take a look
up<00:00:32.820> at<00:00:32.969> this<00:00:33.120> scope<00:00:33.360> here<00:00:34.250> you<00:00:35.250> know<00:00:35.340> this

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:35.520 
up at this scope here you know this

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.959 
up at this scope here you know this
particular<00:00:36.000> scope<00:00:36.239> here<00:00:37.399> will<00:00:38.399> ask<00:00:38.640> you<00:00:38.850> when

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
particular scope here will ask you when

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.750 
particular scope here will ask you when
you<00:00:39.059> press<00:00:40.050> channel<00:00:40.440> 1<00:00:40.649> what<00:00:41.399> the<00:00:41.550> probe

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
you press channel 1 what the probe

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.709 
you press channel 1 what the probe
attenuation<00:00:42.030> is<00:00:42.719> that<00:00:43.110> you're<00:00:43.290> using<00:00:44.390> if<00:00:45.390> some

00:00:45.709 --> 00:00:45.719 
attenuation is that you're using if some

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:47.389 
attenuation is that you're using if some
scopes<00:00:46.020> will<00:00:46.200> automatically<00:00:46.680> detect<00:00:46.980> a<00:00:47.160> probe

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
scopes will automatically detect a probe

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:49.160 
scopes will automatically detect a probe
this<00:00:47.879> one<00:00:48.120> won't<00:00:48.360> so<00:00:48.780> you've<00:00:48.899> got<00:00:49.020> to<00:00:49.110> make

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.170 
this one won't so you've got to make

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:51.410 
this one won't so you've got to make
sure<00:00:49.230> that's<00:00:49.620> right<00:00:49.860> and<00:00:50.160> that's<00:00:50.670> the<00:00:51.210> most

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:51.420 
sure that's right and that's the most

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:53.900 
sure that's right and that's the most
common<00:00:51.870> reason<00:00:52.289> why<00:00:52.500> the<00:00:53.190> amplitude<00:00:53.640> would<00:00:53.789> be

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
common reason why the amplitude would be

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.590 
common reason why the amplitude would be
off<00:00:54.120> if<00:00:55.250> you're<00:00:56.250> off<00:00:56.370> by<00:00:56.579> a<00:00:56.610> factor<00:00:56.850> of<00:00:57.030> 10<00:00:57.390> or

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
off if you're off by a factor of 10 or

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:05.329 
off if you're off by a factor of 10 or
100<00:01:02.899> the<00:01:03.899> second<00:01:04.260> most<00:01:04.439> common<00:01:04.830> reason<00:01:04.860> for

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
100 the second most common reason for

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.730 
100 the second most common reason for
the<00:01:05.580> amplitude<00:01:06.030> to<00:01:06.060> be<00:01:06.270> off<00:01:06.450> is<00:01:06.930> due<00:01:07.260> to<00:01:07.470> the

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
the amplitude to be off is due to the

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.859 
the amplitude to be off is due to the
output<00:01:08.100> impedance<00:01:08.189> of<00:01:08.700> the<00:01:09.150> signal<00:01:09.479> generator

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
output impedance of the signal generator

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.140 
output impedance of the signal generator
most<00:01:10.799> signal<00:01:11.100> generators<00:01:11.610> function

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
most signal generators function

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.609 
most signal generators function
generators<00:01:12.600> have<00:01:12.810> got<00:01:12.960> a<00:01:12.990> 50<00:01:13.350> ohm<00:01:13.470> output

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619 
generators have got a 50 ohm output

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.350 
generators have got a 50 ohm output
impedance<00:01:14.070> which<00:01:14.700> means<00:01:14.909> that<00:01:15.030> it<00:01:15.119> kind<00:01:15.299> of

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
impedance which means that it kind of

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.090 
impedance which means that it kind of
looks<00:01:15.540> like<00:01:15.600> an<00:01:15.869> ideal<00:01:16.140> source<00:01:16.409> followed<00:01:16.950> by<00:01:17.070> a

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.100 
looks like an ideal source followed by a

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.030 
looks like an ideal source followed by a
50<00:01:17.520> ohm<00:01:17.640> resistor<00:01:18.150> and<00:01:18.890> generally<00:01:19.890> when

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
50 ohm resistor and generally when

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:21.950 
50 ohm resistor and generally when
you're<00:01:20.159> setting<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.580> amplitude<00:01:21.090> the

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
you're setting the amplitude the

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.990 
you're setting the amplitude the
generator<00:01:22.650> is<00:01:22.830> making<00:01:23.189> the<00:01:23.310> assumption<00:01:23.820> that

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
generator is making the assumption that

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.140 
generator is making the assumption that
you're<00:01:24.390> loading<00:01:25.159> at<00:01:26.159> the<00:01:26.340> output<00:01:26.759> you're

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
you're loading at the output you're

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:30.230 
you're loading at the output you're
loading<00:01:27.570> it<00:01:27.689> with<00:01:27.900> a<00:01:28.110> 50<00:01:28.560> ohm<00:01:28.680> load<00:01:28.950> and<00:01:29.310> if<00:01:30.119> you

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
loading it with a 50 ohm load and if you

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.390 
loading it with a 50 ohm load and if you
don't<00:01:30.450> load<00:01:30.689> over<00:01:30.869> the<00:01:30.900> 50<00:01:31.229> ohm<00:01:31.259> load<00:01:31.650> then<00:01:32.159> the

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
don't load over the 50 ohm load then the

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.280 
don't load over the 50 ohm load then the
output<00:01:32.759> voltage<00:01:33.420> won't<00:01:33.630> be<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:33.869> same<00:01:34.049> because

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
output voltage won't be the same because

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.740 
output voltage won't be the same because
the<00:01:34.439> generator<00:01:34.890> has<00:01:35.070> no<00:01:35.310> idea<00:01:35.670> you<00:01:36.420> can<00:01:36.540> think

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
the generator has no idea you can think

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.060 
the generator has no idea you can think
of<00:01:36.840> it<00:01:36.930> as<00:01:37.020> this<00:01:37.170> kind<00:01:37.380> of<00:01:37.500> pretty<00:01:37.710> simple

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
of it as this kind of pretty simple

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.910 
of it as this kind of pretty simple
circuit<00:01:38.460> here<00:01:38.700> a<00:01:38.820> simple<00:01:39.240> voltage<00:01:39.390> divider

circuit here a simple voltage divider
when<00:01:40.920> you<00:01:41.040> I<00:01:41.189> tell<00:01:41.400> this<00:01:41.520> function<00:01:41.850> generator

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
when you I tell this function generator

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.120 
when you I tell this function generator
I<00:01:42.299> want<00:01:42.600> to<00:01:42.659> put<00:01:42.840> out<00:01:42.990> you<00:01:43.590> know<00:01:43.680> one<00:01:43.920> volt

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:44.130 
I want to put out you know one volt

00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:46.969 
I want to put out you know one volt
peak-to-peak<00:01:44.399> at<00:01:45.360> the<00:01:45.600> load<00:01:45.810> it's<00:01:46.530> assuming

peak-to-peak at the load it's assuming

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.639 
peak-to-peak at the load it's assuming
that<00:01:47.189> that<00:01:47.340> load<00:01:47.520> is<00:01:47.670> 50<00:01:48.000> ohms<00:01:48.030> so<00:01:48.930> if<00:01:49.439> I've<00:01:49.619> got

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
that that load is 50 ohms so if I've got

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:52.280 
that that load is 50 ohms so if I've got
a<00:01:49.829> 50<00:01:50.189> ohms<00:01:50.340> here<00:01:50.490> and<00:01:50.939> 15<00:01:51.420> ohms<00:01:51.540> here<00:01:51.659> to

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:52.290 
a 50 ohms here and 15 ohms here to

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.889 
a 50 ohms here and 15 ohms here to

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899 
create one volt peak-to-peak here that's

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:57.440 
create one volt peak-to-peak here that's
to<00:01:55.049> put<00:01:55.200> 2<00:01:55.350> volts<00:01:55.680> peak-to-peak<00:01:55.890> there<00:01:56.520> so<00:01:57.360> the

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
to put 2 volts peak-to-peak there so the

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.209 
to put 2 volts peak-to-peak there so the
most<00:01:57.600> common<00:01:57.689> thing<00:01:58.229> that<00:01:58.439> you'd<00:01:58.560> see<00:01:58.890> is<00:01:59.070> that

00:01:59.209 --> 00:01:59.219 
most common thing that you'd see is that

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:00.889 
most common thing that you'd see is that
I<00:01:59.399> set<00:01:59.729> the<00:01:59.820> output<00:02:00.149> to<00:02:00.270> 1<00:02:00.450> volt<00:02:00.630> peak-to-peak

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:00.899 
I set the output to 1 volt peak-to-peak

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.800 
I set the output to 1 volt peak-to-peak
but<00:02:01.890> I'm<00:02:02.009> reading<00:02:02.219> 2<00:02:02.520> volts<00:02:02.820> peak-to-peak<00:02:03.030> and

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
but I'm reading 2 volts peak-to-peak and

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.840 
but I'm reading 2 volts peak-to-peak and
that's<00:02:03.930> because<00:02:04.290> oftentimes<00:02:04.740> the<00:02:05.670> load

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
that's because oftentimes the load

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.880 
that's because oftentimes the load
impedance<00:02:06.020> might<00:02:07.020> be<00:02:07.200> a<00:02:07.229> very<00:02:07.469> high<00:02:07.710> impedance

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
impedance might be a very high impedance

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.520 
impedance might be a very high impedance
and<00:02:08.429> therefore<00:02:08.819> this<00:02:09.000> voltage<00:02:09.179> divider<00:02:09.720> works

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
and therefore this voltage divider works

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:12.110 
and therefore this voltage divider works
out<00:02:10.770> where<00:02:10.979> there's<00:02:11.160> very<00:02:11.489> little<00:02:11.700> voltage

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
out where there's very little voltage

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.670 
out where there's very little voltage
dropped<00:02:12.480> across<00:02:12.629> the<00:02:12.989> 50<00:02:13.260> mm

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:13.680 
dropped across the 50 mm

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.589 
dropped across the 50 mm
and<00:02:14.010> it's<00:02:14.159> all<00:02:14.310> dropped<00:02:14.640> here<00:02:14.939> and<00:02:15.329> you're

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
and it's all dropped here and you're

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:17.149 
and it's all dropped here and you're
seeing<00:02:15.930> almost<00:02:16.260> the<00:02:16.560> open<00:02:16.799> circuit<00:02:17.129> voltage

00:02:17.149 --> 00:02:17.159 
seeing almost the open circuit voltage

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:19.580 
seeing almost the open circuit voltage
of<00:02:17.670> the<00:02:17.760> generator<00:02:17.989> so<00:02:18.989> I'll<00:02:19.260> show<00:02:19.379> you<00:02:19.470> what

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:19.590 
of the generator so I'll show you what

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:26.899 
of the generator so I'll show you what
that<00:02:19.620> looks<00:02:19.920> like<00:02:19.980> on<00:02:20.250> the<00:02:20.370> equipment<00:02:25.909> so

00:02:26.899 --> 00:02:26.909 
that looks like on the equipment so

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:28.850 
that looks like on the equipment so
here's<00:02:27.090> an<00:02:27.209> example<00:02:27.299> we<00:02:27.900> have<00:02:27.930> a<00:02:28.110> 1<00:02:28.560> megahertz

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
here's an example we have a 1 megahertz

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:30.800 
here's an example we have a 1 megahertz
sine<00:02:29.310> wave<00:02:29.549> setup<00:02:30.150> out<00:02:30.269> of<00:02:30.390> the<00:02:30.450> function

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:30.810 
sine wave setup out of the function

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.460 
sine wave setup out of the function
generator<00:02:30.930> at<00:02:31.379> 1<00:02:32.340> volt<00:02:32.370> peak-to-peak<00:02:33.379> so<00:02:34.379> if

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
generator at 1 volt peak-to-peak so if

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:36.979 
generator at 1 volt peak-to-peak so if
we<00:02:34.590> simply<00:02:34.950> connect<00:02:35.400> this<00:02:35.549> directly<00:02:36.000> up<00:02:36.209> to

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
we simply connect this directly up to

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:40.250 
we simply connect this directly up to
the<00:02:37.019> scope<00:02:38.540> take<00:02:39.540> a<00:02:39.569> look<00:02:39.780> at<00:02:39.870> what<00:02:39.959> the<00:02:40.049> scope

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
the scope take a look at what the scope

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.860 
the scope take a look at what the scope
is<00:02:40.439> showing<00:02:40.739> me<00:02:41.390> so<00:02:42.390> if<00:02:42.450> you<00:02:42.540> look<00:02:42.659> at<00:02:42.780> the

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
is showing me so if you look at the

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:44.630 
is showing me so if you look at the
scope<00:02:43.049> we're<00:02:43.319> seeing<00:02:43.560> you<00:02:43.950> know<00:02:43.980> or<00:02:44.280> 1

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:44.640 
scope we're seeing you know or 1

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.030 
scope we're seeing you know or 1
megahertz<00:02:45.060> signal<00:02:45.409> 500<00:02:46.409> millivolts<00:02:46.680> per

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
megahertz signal 500 millivolts per

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.740 
megahertz signal 500 millivolts per
division<00:02:47.220> and<00:02:47.670> if<00:02:47.879> we<00:02:47.970> look<00:02:48.120> carefully<00:02:48.299> I<00:02:48.569> can

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:48.750 
division and if we look carefully I can

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.289 
division and if we look carefully I can
see<00:02:48.930> I've<00:02:49.079> got<00:02:49.260> 4<00:02:49.650> divisions<00:02:50.099> so<00:02:50.730> that's<00:02:50.909> 2

00:02:51.289 --> 00:02:51.299 
see I've got 4 divisions so that's 2

00:02:51.299 --> 00:02:53.300 
see I've got 4 divisions so that's 2
volts<00:02:51.599> peak-to-peak<00:02:51.840> and<00:02:52.349> again<00:02:53.159> that's

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
volts peak-to-peak and again that's

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.309 
volts peak-to-peak and again that's
because<00:02:53.670> the<00:02:53.849> scope<00:02:54.090> is<00:02:54.450> presenting<00:02:55.079> a<00:02:55.170> high

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:55.319 
because the scope is presenting a high

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:58.190 
because the scope is presenting a high
impedance<00:02:56.060> to<00:02:57.060> the<00:02:57.090> function<00:02:57.540> generator<00:02:57.659> and

00:02:58.190 --> 00:02:58.200 
impedance to the function generator and

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.809 
impedance to the function generator and
therefore<00:02:58.620> that<00:02:58.739> voltage<00:02:59.159> divider<00:02:59.459> is<00:02:59.639> and

00:02:59.809 --> 00:02:59.819 
therefore that voltage divider is and

00:02:59.819 --> 00:03:02.509 
therefore that voltage divider is and
what<00:02:59.970> the<00:03:00.150> function<00:03:00.750> generator<00:03:00.870> assumed<00:03:01.590> when

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
what the function generator assumed when

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:04.640 
what the function generator assumed when
you<00:03:02.609> set<00:03:02.790> up<00:03:02.879> the<00:03:03.000> voltage<00:03:03.349> so<00:03:04.349> the<00:03:04.470> way<00:03:04.590> to

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:04.650 
you set up the voltage so the way to

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.009 
you set up the voltage so the way to
correct<00:03:05.010> that<00:03:05.220> would<00:03:05.849> be<00:03:06.030> to<00:03:06.209> use<00:03:06.239> a<00:03:06.599> 50<00:03:06.930> ohm

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
correct that would be to use a 50 ohm

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:09.199 
correct that would be to use a 50 ohm
terminator<00:03:07.530> through<00:03:07.889> terminator<00:03:08.370> so

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:09.209 
terminator through terminator so

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:11.300 
terminator through terminator so
something<00:03:09.689> like<00:03:09.720> this<00:03:09.989> this<00:03:10.439> one<00:03:10.620> here<00:03:10.920> it's

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:11.310 
something like this this one here it's

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:13.789 
something like this this one here it's
just<00:03:11.400> a<00:03:11.639> coaxial<00:03:12.150> through<00:03:12.420> terminator<00:03:12.900> and<00:03:13.680> we

00:03:13.789 --> 00:03:13.799 
just a coaxial through terminator and we

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:15.740 
just a coaxial through terminator and we
can<00:03:13.950> connect<00:03:14.220> that<00:03:14.310> up<00:03:14.370> to<00:03:14.670> the<00:03:15.389> end<00:03:15.540> of<00:03:15.659> the

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:15.750 
can connect that up to the end of the

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:20.330 
can connect that up to the end of the
coax<00:03:16.109> and<00:03:16.579> put<00:03:17.579> that<00:03:17.730> into<00:03:17.940> the<00:03:18.090> scope<00:03:19.340> all

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.340 
coax and put that into the scope all

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.729 
coax and put that into the scope all
right<00:03:20.489> and<00:03:20.699> now<00:03:20.819> we<00:03:20.849> get<00:03:21.120> our<00:03:21.150> correct<00:03:21.569> 1<00:03:22.500> volt

00:03:22.729 --> 00:03:22.739 
right and now we get our correct 1 volt

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:26.990 
right and now we get our correct 1 volt
peak-to-peak<00:03:23.389> but<00:03:24.389> in<00:03:25.169> many<00:03:25.379> cases<00:03:25.730> using<00:03:26.730> a<00:03:26.819> 1

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
peak-to-peak but in many cases using a 1

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.270 
peak-to-peak but in many cases using a 1
ohm<00:03:27.150> or<00:03:27.419> assuming<00:03:28.019> a<00:03:28.319> through<00:03:28.560> terminator<00:03:29.040> is

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
ohm or assuming a through terminator is

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:32.839 
ohm or assuming a through terminator is
not<00:03:29.489> practical<00:03:30.299> or<00:03:30.480> maybe<00:03:31.169> it<00:03:31.349> don't<00:03:31.440> have<00:03:31.709> one

00:03:32.839 --> 00:03:32.849

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:36.259 
not practical or maybe it don't have one
in<00:03:33.180> those<00:03:33.389> cases<00:03:33.980> many<00:03:34.980> times<00:03:35.340> the<00:03:36.030> function

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
in those cases many times the function

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:38.300 
in those cases many times the function

output<00:03:53.280> menu<00:03:53.969> down<00:03:54.180> here<00:03:54.680> we<00:03:55.680> have<00:03:55.799> the<00:03:55.950> option

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:56.250 
output menu down here we have the option

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:58.280 
output menu down here we have the option
of<00:03:56.310> specifying<00:03:56.579> what<00:03:57.329> the<00:03:57.450> load<00:03:57.629> impedance<00:03:57.780> is

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
of specifying what the load impedance is

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:01.309 
of specifying what the load impedance is
so<00:03:59.280> if<00:03:59.370> I<00:03:59.459> select<00:03:59.640> load<00:04:00.030> impedance<00:04:00.480> we<00:04:01.230> have

00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:01.319 
so if I select load impedance we have

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:03.830 
so if I select load impedance we have
the<00:04:01.409> choice<00:04:01.590> of<00:04:01.769> selecting<00:04:02.280> 50<00:04:02.849> ohms<00:04:03.030> or<00:04:03.659> we

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
the choice of selecting 50 ohms or we

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.020 
the choice of selecting 50 ohms or we
can<00:04:03.989> dial<00:04:04.200> in<00:04:04.349> a<00:04:04.409> specific<00:04:04.980> load<00:04:05.220> if<00:04:05.519> we<00:04:05.849> knew

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:06.030 
can dial in a specific load if we knew

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:09.410 
can dial in a specific load if we knew
it<00:04:06.150> was<00:04:06.299> you<00:04:06.540> know<00:04:06.659> 70<00:04:07.409> ohms<00:04:07.590> or<00:04:08.000> 120<00:04:09.000> ohms<00:04:09.180> or

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
it was you know 70 ohms or 120 ohms or

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:10.880 
it was you know 70 ohms or 120 ohms or
whatever<00:04:09.659> the<00:04:09.780> load<00:04:09.930> is<00:04:10.079> we<00:04:10.260> can<00:04:10.409> put<00:04:10.530> that<00:04:10.739> in

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:10.890 
whatever the load is we can put that in

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:14.179 
whatever the load is we can put that in
there<00:04:11.129> or<00:04:11.340> we<00:04:12.120> can<00:04:12.269> dial<00:04:12.480> in<00:04:12.659> just<00:04:12.870> high<00:04:13.049> Z<00:04:13.409> if

00:04:14.179 --> 00:04:14.189 
there or we can dial in just high Z if

00:04:14.189 --> 00:04:16.039 
there or we can dial in just high Z if
you've<00:04:14.430> got<00:04:14.579> a<00:04:14.609> load<00:04:15.150> impedance<00:04:15.599> that's<00:04:15.810> a

00:04:16.039 --> 00:04:16.049 
you've got a load impedance that's a

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:17.360 
you've got a load impedance that's a
couple<00:04:16.350> of<00:04:16.440> orders<00:04:16.650> of<00:04:16.769> magnitude<00:04:17.220> greater

00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:17.370 
couple of orders of magnitude greater

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:20.240 
couple of orders of magnitude greater
than<00:04:17.579> 50<00:04:17.970> ohms<00:04:18.150> high<00:04:18.900> Z<00:04:19.199> will<00:04:19.349> be<00:04:19.380> accurate

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
than 50 ohms high Z will be accurate

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:23.420 
than 50 ohms high Z will be accurate
enough<00:04:20.840> to<00:04:21.840> give<00:04:22.470> you<00:04:22.560> that<00:04:22.770> correct<00:04:23.070> result

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:23.430 
enough to give you that correct result

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:26.540 
enough to give you that correct result
so<00:04:24.060> now<00:04:24.210> by<00:04:24.389> selecting<00:04:24.449> that<00:04:24.930> high<00:04:25.259> Z<00:04:25.680> let's<00:04:26.460> go

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
so now by selecting that high Z let's go

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:28.670 
so now by selecting that high Z let's go
back<00:04:26.729> to<00:04:26.880> our<00:04:26.910> amplitude<00:04:27.270> control<00:04:27.840> and<00:04:28.500> we<00:04:28.560> can

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:28.680 
back to our amplitude control and we can

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.350 
back to our amplitude control and we can
see<00:04:28.770> the<00:04:28.889> amplitude<00:04:29.310> is<00:04:29.400> now<00:04:29.520> but<00:04:29.729> jump<00:04:30.030> to<00:04:30.150> 2

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:30.360 
see the amplitude is now but jump to 2

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:32.560 
see the amplitude is now but jump to 2
volts<00:04:30.660> peak-to-peak<00:04:30.870> because<00:04:31.590> it<00:04:31.740> knows<00:04:31.919> that

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:32.570 
volts peak-to-peak because it knows that

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:35.810 
volts peak-to-peak because it knows that
2<00:04:33.570> volts<00:04:33.840> peak-to-peak<00:04:34.020> is<00:04:34.550> what<00:04:35.550> we're<00:04:35.669> going

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:35.820 
2 volts peak-to-peak is what we're going

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:37.310 
2 volts peak-to-peak is what we're going
to<00:04:35.910> wind<00:04:36.090> up<00:04:36.210> with<00:04:36.270> in<00:04:36.690> that<00:04:36.840> high<00:04:37.020> impedance

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:37.320 
to wind up with in that high impedance

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:39.770 
to wind up with in that high impedance
load<00:04:37.710> and<00:04:38.130> we<00:04:38.250> look<00:04:38.400> back<00:04:38.580> up<00:04:38.610> at<00:04:38.940> the<00:04:39.000> scope

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:39.780 
load and we look back up at the scope

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:43.129 
load and we look back up at the scope
screen<00:04:40.130> okay<00:04:41.160> got<00:04:42.150> the<00:04:42.240> same<00:04:42.419> situation<00:04:42.660> that

00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:43.139 
screen okay got the same situation that

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:45.080 
screen okay got the same situation that
we<00:04:43.229> had<00:04:43.380> before<00:04:43.530> it's<00:04:44.370> 2<00:04:44.610> volts<00:04:44.910> peak-to-peak

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:45.090 
we had before it's 2 volts peak-to-peak

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:48.110 
we had before it's 2 volts peak-to-peak
but<00:04:45.870> now<00:04:46.020> it<00:04:46.169> does<00:04:46.349> match<00:04:46.650> what<00:04:47.580> the<00:04:47.729> function

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:48.120 
but now it does match what the function

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:50.980 
but now it does match what the function
generator<00:04:48.210> was<00:04:48.690> giving<00:04:48.990> us<00:04:49.139> in<00:04:49.380> its<00:04:50.370> display

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:50.990 
generator was giving us in its display

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:53.990 
generator was giving us in its display
but<00:04:51.990> that<00:04:52.229> is<00:04:52.409> the<00:04:52.560> most<00:04:52.770> common<00:04:53.099> reason<00:04:53.250> why

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:54.000 
but that is the most common reason why

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.990 
but that is the most common reason why
the<00:04:54.479> function<00:04:54.870> generator<00:04:54.990> output<00:04:55.650> amplitude

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:56.000 
the function generator output amplitude

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.060 
the function generator output amplitude
may<00:04:57.000> not<00:04:57.180> match<00:04:57.510> what<00:04:57.960> you<00:04:58.080> set<00:04:58.320> it<00:04:58.440> to<00:04:58.620> you

00:04:59.060 --> 00:04:59.070 
may not match what you set it to you

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:00.290 
may not match what you set it to you
just<00:04:59.159> have<00:04:59.340> to<00:04:59.430> be<00:04:59.550> careful<00:04:59.729> of<00:05:00.000> the<00:05:00.150> load

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:00.300 
just have to be careful of the load

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.750 
just have to be careful of the load
impedance<00:05:00.419> both<00:05:01.409> what<00:05:01.710> the<00:05:01.889> generator<00:05:02.580> is

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:02.760 
impedance both what the generator is

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:04.339 
impedance both what the generator is
expecting<00:05:03.389> and<00:05:03.570> what<00:05:03.840> your<00:05:04.020> load<00:05:04.199> is

00:05:04.339 --> 00:05:04.349 
expecting and what your load is

00:05:04.349 --> 00:05:05.960 
expecting and what your load is
presenting<00:05:04.860> and<00:05:05.010> make<00:05:05.099> sure<00:05:05.250> they<00:05:05.430> match<00:05:05.669> and

00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:05.970 
presenting and make sure they match and

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:08.320 
presenting and make sure they match and
then<00:05:06.510> the<00:05:06.630> amplitude<00:05:07.080> should<00:05:07.229> match<00:05:07.440> as<00:05:07.620> well

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:08.330 
then the amplitude should match as well

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:10.460 
then the amplitude should match as well
thanks<00:05:09.330> again<00:05:09.419> for<00:05:09.659> watching<00:05:10.020> in<00:05:10.139> the<00:05:10.289> house
