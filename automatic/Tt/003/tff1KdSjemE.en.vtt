with the blind installed on the test rig

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:47.770 
with the blind installed on the test rig
we've<00:02:45.920> covered<00:02:46.250> the<00:02:46.460> head<00:02:46.640> box<00:02:46.910> so<00:02:47.450> as<00:02:47.600> not<00:02:47.720> to

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:47.780 
we've covered the head box so as not to

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.860 
we've covered the head box so as not to
embarrass<00:02:48.050> any<00:02:48.620> of<00:02:48.800> the<00:02:48.890> other<00:02:49.040> manufacturers

embarrass any of the other manufacturers

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:55.250 
embarrass any of the other manufacturers
so<00:02:50.870> let's<00:02:51.500> start<00:02:51.890> the<00:02:52.040> test

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.990 

from<00:02:56.260> one<00:02:56.530> meter<00:02:56.800> the<00:02:57.100> bottle<00:02:57.400> strikes<00:02:57.820> the

00:02:57.990 --> 00:02:58.000 
from one meter the bottle strikes the

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.940 
from one meter the bottle strikes the
blind<00:02:58.270> and<00:02:58.510> you<00:02:58.960> can<00:02:59.140> see<00:02:59.350> it<00:02:59.440> has<00:02:59.560> pulled<00:02:59.830> the

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
blind and you can see it has pulled the

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.430 
blind and you can see it has pulled the
fabric<00:03:00.460> and<00:03:00.610> the<00:03:00.820> bar<00:03:01.060> out<00:03:01.420> of<00:03:01.870> the<00:03:02.170> side

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.730 
channel on one side from 1.5 meters the
impact<00:03:07.330> has<00:03:07.540> pulled<00:03:07.780> the<00:03:07.930> cloth<00:03:08.140> out<00:03:08.380> from

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:08.740 
impact has pulled the cloth out from

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:12.150 
impact has pulled the cloth out from
both<00:03:09.010> channels<00:03:09.430> and<00:03:10.110> from<00:03:11.110> 2<00:03:11.350> meters<00:03:11.530> the

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
both channels and from 2 meters the

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:15.430 
both channels and from 2 meters the
damage<00:03:12.550> is<00:03:12.760> obviously<00:03:13.300> even<00:03:13.750> worse

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:15.440 
damage is obviously even worse

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:24.430 
damage is obviously even worse
you

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.390 

this<00:03:25.440> is<00:03:25.710> an<00:03:25.830> electrically<00:03:26.400> operated

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
this is an electrically operated

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.089 
this is an electrically operated
and<00:03:27.760> as<00:03:27.939> the<00:03:28.060> blind<00:03:28.299> is<00:03:28.510> retracted<00:03:29.110> it<00:03:29.560> jams

00:03:30.089 --> 00:03:30.099 
and as the blind is retracted it jams

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:32.940 
and as the blind is retracted it jams
before<00:03:30.489> it<00:03:30.790> is<00:03:30.909> fully<00:03:31.150> closed<00:03:31.629> a<00:03:32.049> common

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:32.950 
before it is fully closed a common

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:34.740 
before it is fully closed a common
problem<00:03:33.400> with<00:03:33.579> standard<00:03:34.060> dim<00:03:34.269> out<00:03:34.390> blinds

00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:34.750 
problem with standard dim out blinds

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:36.869 
problem with standard dim out blinds
with<00:03:35.049> this<00:03:35.230> type<00:03:35.439> of<00:03:35.470> operation<00:03:35.950> often

00:03:36.869 --> 00:03:36.879 
with this type of operation often

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:43.430 
with this type of operation often
causing<00:03:37.390> permanent<00:03:37.689> damage

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:49.010 

the<00:03:43.860> second<00:03:44.340> test<00:03:44.580> blind<00:03:44.880> has<00:03:45.210> been<00:03:45.390> installed

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:49.020 

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:51.200 

so<00:03:49.650> let's<00:03:49.890> run<00:03:50.100> the<00:03:50.250> test<00:03:50.400> from<00:03:50.700> one<00:03:50.940> meter

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:51.210 
so let's run the test from one meter

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:53.900 
so let's run the test from one meter
again<00:03:51.450> and<00:03:52.050> you<00:03:52.170> can<00:03:52.320> see<00:03:52.560> that<00:03:52.830> this<00:03:53.040> fails<00:03:53.520> at

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:53.910 
again and you can see that this fails at

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.420 
again and you can see that this fails at
the<00:03:54.090> first<00:03:54.390> distance<00:03:54.930> so<00:03:55.530> it<00:03:55.680> was<00:03:55.890> not<00:03:56.100> worth

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:56.430 
the first distance so it was not worth

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.550 
the first distance so it was not worth
subjecting<00:03:57.150> it<00:03:57.300> to<00:03:57.330> any<00:03:57.660> more<00:03:57.900> tests<00:03:58.440> and

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
subjecting it to any more tests and

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.920 
subjecting it to any more tests and
obviously<00:03:59.490> with<00:03:59.790> the<00:03:59.880> fabric<00:04:00.240> not<00:04:00.450> retained

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
obviously with the fabric not retained

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.200 
obviously with the fabric not retained
the<00:04:01.440> retraction<00:04:02.160> of<00:04:02.250> the<00:04:02.310> blind<00:04:02.670> was

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:03.210 
the retraction of the blind was

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:10.140 
the retraction of the blind was
problematic

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:10.150 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:12.380 

just<00:04:10.780> three<00:04:11.140> kilograms

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:12.390 
just three kilograms

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:14.840 
just three kilograms
distance<00:04:12.630> of<00:04:12.810> one<00:04:13.020> meter<00:04:13.319> was<00:04:13.920> enough<00:04:14.280> to<00:04:14.610> pull

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:14.850 
distance of one meter was enough to pull

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:17.060 
distance of one meter was enough to pull
a<00:04:14.880> fabric<00:04:15.450> right<00:04:15.750> out<00:04:15.960> of<00:04:15.990> both<00:04:16.350> channels<00:04:16.709> of

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:25.160 
as the blind is retracted it actually

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.400 
as the blind is retracted it actually
becomes<00:04:25.490> jammed<00:04:26.060> on<00:04:26.360> a<00:04:26.390> splinter<00:04:26.900> in<00:04:26.930> the<00:04:27.170> test

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:27.410 
becomes jammed on a splinter in the test

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:29.710 
becomes jammed on a splinter in the test
frame<00:04:27.710> but<00:04:28.400> you<00:04:28.550> can<00:04:28.700> easily<00:04:29.000> see<00:04:29.450> that<00:04:29.480> it

frame but you can easily see that it

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:34.410 
frame but you can easily see that it
would<00:04:29.870> not<00:04:30.020> have<00:04:30.140> retracted<00:04:30.680> properly<00:04:31.070> anyway

unaffected<00:04:53.790> so<00:04:54.790> if<00:04:54.910> that<00:04:55.060> was<00:04:55.240> not<00:04:55.360> proof

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:55.660 
unaffected so if that was not proof

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:58.230 
unaffected so if that was not proof
enough<00:04:55.840> let's<00:04:56.740> double<00:04:57.250> the<00:04:57.280> weight<00:04:57.580> to<00:04:58.000> just

00:04:58.230 --> 00:04:58.240 
enough let's double the weight to just

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:01.320 
enough let's double the weight to just
over<00:04:58.600> 6<00:04:58.900> kilograms<00:04:59.230> and<00:04:59.680> test<00:05:00.460> the<00:05:00.760> blind<00:05:01.030> from

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:01.330 
over 6 kilograms and test the blind from

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:05.280 
over 6 kilograms and test the blind from
the<00:05:01.480> maximum<00:05:02.050> to<00:05:02.500> meet<00:05:02.770> a<00:05:02.800> distance<00:05:03.990> the<00:05:04.990> cloth

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:05.290 
the maximum to meet a distance the cloth

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:07.350 
the maximum to meet a distance the cloth
is<00:05:05.590> still<00:05:05.890> fully<00:05:06.310> retained<00:05:06.820> in<00:05:07.060> the<00:05:07.150> sight

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:07.360 
is still fully retained in the sight

00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:09.750 
is still fully retained in the sight
channels<00:05:07.780> and<00:05:07.960> you<00:05:08.470> can<00:05:08.680> see<00:05:08.920> the<00:05:09.190> zip-lined

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:09.760 
channels and you can see the zip-lined

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:11.790 
channels and you can see the zip-lined
is<00:05:10.000> looking<00:05:10.330> the<00:05:10.450> worse<00:05:10.630> for<00:05:10.660> wear<00:05:10.930> despite

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:11.800 
is looking the worse for wear despite

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:17.580 
is looking the worse for wear despite
what<00:05:12.040> we<00:05:12.190> have<00:05:12.430> literally<00:05:13.150> thrown<00:05:13.930> at<00:05:14.110> it

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:17.590 

00:05:17.590 --> 00:05:20.560 

so<00:05:18.590> there<00:05:18.740> you<00:05:18.860> have<00:05:18.890> it<00:05:19.070> proof<00:05:19.910> positive<00:05:20.180> of

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:20.570
