and<00:00:00.989> winding<00:00:01.680> down<00:00:01.829> the<00:00:02.070> day<00:00:02.220> to<00:00:02.280> boss<00:00:02.550> came

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:02.760 
and winding down the day to boss came

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.630 
and winding down the day to boss came
out<00:00:02.939> to<00:00:03.060> go<00:00:03.360> see<00:00:03.510> how<00:00:03.570> things<00:00:03.780> are<00:00:03.899> doing<00:00:04.640> and

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:05.640 
out to go see how things are doing and

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.150 
out to go see how things are doing and
he<00:00:05.790> says<00:00:06.029> a<00:00:06.410> good<00:00:07.410> job<00:00:07.620> but<00:00:07.770> he<00:00:07.830> took<00:00:07.980> a<00:00:08.040> long

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:08.160 
he says a good job but he took a long

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.950 
he says a good job but he took a long
time<00:00:09.110> actually<00:00:10.110> did<00:00:10.440> take<00:00:10.559> all<00:00:10.679> that<00:00:10.800> long<00:00:11.960> so

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:12.960 
time actually did take all that long so

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:13.850 
time actually did take all that long so
we<00:00:13.080> got<00:00:13.200> our<00:00:13.290> all<00:00:13.410> in

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
we got our all in

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:24.610 
we got our all in
he's<00:00:14.429> tight<00:00:14.730> like<00:00:14.910> a<00:00:14.940> drum<00:00:20.779> and

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:24.620 

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:26.200 

the<00:00:25.070> hardest<00:00:25.340> part<00:00:25.520> was<00:00:25.610> probably<00:00:25.880> the<00:00:26.000> back

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:26.210 
the hardest part was probably the back

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:28.720 
the hardest part was probably the back
strip<00:00:27.010> this<00:00:28.010> because<00:00:28.250> the<00:00:28.340> amount<00:00:28.490> of<00:00:28.550> room

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:28.730 
strip this because the amount of room

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:34.000 
strip this because the amount of room
that<00:00:28.880> you<00:00:28.970> have<00:00:32.320> not<00:00:33.320> much<00:00:33.530> light<00:00:33.740> in<00:00:33.890> here

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:34.010 
that you have not much light in here

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.670 
that you have not much light in here
this<00:00:34.250> one's<00:00:34.430> got<00:00:34.550> the<00:00:34.670> three<00:00:35.380> the<00:00:36.380> three

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:36.680 
this one's got the three the three

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:52.290 
this one's got the three the three
windows<00:00:39.070> open<00:00:40.070> one<00:00:40.250> up<00:00:49.300> again<00:00:50.300> without<00:00:50.450> area

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:52.300 
windows open one up again without area

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:56.770 
windows open one up again without area
so<00:00:53.300> the<00:00:53.629> hardest<00:00:53.870> part<00:00:53.989> was<00:00:54.230> probably<00:00:55.780> the

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:56.780 
so the hardest part was probably the

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.890 
so the hardest part was probably the
back<00:00:57.019> strip<00:00:57.940> the<00:00:58.940> cushion<00:00:59.330> is<00:00:59.420> now<00:00:59.570> in<00:00:59.720> front

00:00:59.890 --> 00:00:59.900 
back strip the cushion is now in front

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.299 
back strip the cushion is now in front
of<00:01:00.019> it<00:01:00.140> but<00:01:00.379> it<00:01:01.370> looks<00:01:01.760> like<00:01:01.970> these<00:01:02.210> right<00:01:02.839> here

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:03.309 
of it but it looks like these right here

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:05.530 
of it but it looks like these right here
and<00:01:04.309> you're<00:01:04.489> trying<00:01:04.730> to<00:01:04.790> pinch<00:01:05.030> the<00:01:05.180> molding

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:05.540 
and you're trying to pinch the molding

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:09.850 
and you're trying to pinch the molding
in<00:01:05.659> between<00:01:05.930> these<00:01:06.110> two<00:01:06.380> and<00:01:07.690> the<00:01:08.690> last<00:01:09.140> part

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 
in between these two and the last part

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:11.380 
in between these two and the last part
we<00:01:10.250> started<00:01:10.520> with<00:01:10.610> the<00:01:10.670> very<00:01:10.820> front<00:01:11.090> we<00:01:11.210> found

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:11.390 
we started with the very front we found

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.290 
we started with the very front we found
the<00:01:11.480> center<00:01:11.750> of<00:01:11.900> it<00:01:13.030> we're<00:01:14.030> in<00:01:14.090> the<00:01:14.180> first

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:14.300 
the center of it we're in the first

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.930 
the center of it we're in the first
screw<00:01:14.570> down<00:01:14.690> the<00:01:14.750> center<00:01:15.140> we<00:01:15.560> left<00:01:15.860> the<00:01:16.340> bar

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:16.940 
screw down the center we left the bar

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:19.600 
screw down the center we left the bar
that<00:01:17.240> holds<00:01:17.420> the<00:01:17.720> ceiling<00:01:18.140> up<00:01:18.320> cocked<00:01:18.979> back<00:01:19.310> so

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:19.610 
that holds the ceiling up cocked back so

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:21.490 
that holds the ceiling up cocked back so
it<00:01:19.670> wasn't<00:01:20.150> taught<00:01:20.360> and<00:01:20.990> we<00:01:21.080> put<00:01:21.260> a<00:01:21.290> piece<00:01:21.440> of

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:21.500 
it wasn't taught and we put a piece of

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.399 
it wasn't taught and we put a piece of
wood<00:01:21.770> between<00:01:21.950> the<00:01:22.190> bottom<00:01:22.610> bracket<00:01:23.030> and<00:01:23.409> the

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:24.409 
wood between the bottom bracket and the

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:27.250 
wood between the bottom bracket and the
top<00:01:24.650> section<00:01:25.070> up<00:01:25.159> here<00:01:25.720> and<00:01:26.720> it<00:01:26.840> probably<00:01:26.990> was

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:27.260 
top section up here and it probably was

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.109 
top section up here and it probably was
death<00:01:27.470> right<00:01:27.710> down<00:01:27.920> about<00:01:28.130> a<00:01:28.190> foot<00:01:28.520> but<00:01:29.030> it

00:01:29.109 --> 00:01:29.119 
death right down about a foot but it

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:30.520 
death right down about a foot but it
gave<00:01:29.240> you<00:01:29.329> enough<00:01:29.540> room<00:01:29.719> in<00:01:29.869> enough<00:01:30.049> material

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:30.530 
gave you enough room in enough material

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:31.780 
gave you enough room in enough material
to<00:01:30.710> work<00:01:31.280> with<00:01:31.520> it

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:31.790 
to work with it

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:33.310 
to work with it
all<00:01:32.060> the<00:01:32.270> way<00:01:32.360> around<00:01:32.509> so<00:01:32.780> we<00:01:32.960> did<00:01:33.110> the<00:01:33.170> very

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:33.320 
all the way around so we did the very

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.319 
all the way around so we did the very
front<00:01:33.619> one<00:01:33.770> and<00:01:34.520> you<00:01:34.610> got<00:01:34.729> to<00:01:34.820> go<00:01:34.909> in<00:01:35.030> and<00:01:35.180> cut

00:01:35.319 --> 00:01:35.329 
front one and you got to go in and cut

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:37.600 
front one and you got to go in and cut
the<00:01:35.420> corners<00:01:35.810> so<00:01:36.020> it<00:01:36.860> kind<00:01:37.100> of<00:01:37.159> swings<00:01:37.460> the

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610 
the corners so it kind of swings the

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:38.649 
the corners so it kind of swings the
corners<00:01:37.880> a<00:01:37.939> little<00:01:38.090> bit<00:01:38.299> I<00:01:38.329> know<00:01:38.420> it's<00:01:38.630> a

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:38.659 
corners a little bit I know it's a

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:40.749 
corners a little bit I know it's a
little<00:01:38.780> curly<00:01:39.140> wurly<00:01:39.530> but<00:01:39.740> that's<00:01:40.490> what<00:01:40.610> we're

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:40.759 
little curly wurly but that's what we're

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:41.520 
little curly wurly but that's what we're
going<00:01:40.939> with

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:41.530 
going with

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:45.999 
going with
and<00:01:42.530> then<00:01:43.219> we<00:01:43.280> did<00:01:43.430> the<00:01:43.549> two<00:01:43.700> side<00:01:43.939> pieces<00:01:45.009> and

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:46.009 
and then we did the two side pieces and

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:47.469 
and then we did the two side pieces and
when<00:01:46.159> we<00:01:46.250> got<00:01:46.399> to<00:01:46.520> the<00:01:46.640> back<00:01:46.850> the<00:01:47.270> back<00:01:47.450> is

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:47.479 
when we got to the back the back is

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:49.029 
when we got to the back the back is
pretty<00:01:47.689> much<00:01:47.930> the<00:01:48.079> same<00:01:48.259> deal<00:01:48.560> just<00:01:48.590> that

00:01:49.029 --> 00:01:49.039 
pretty much the same deal just that

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:51.490 
pretty much the same deal just that
you're<00:01:49.159> working<00:01:49.369> with<00:01:49.700> about<00:01:50.200> ten<00:01:51.200> inches<00:01:51.350> of

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 
you're working with about ten inches of

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.529 
you're working with about ten inches of
space<00:01:51.710> between<00:01:51.860> the<00:01:52.310> ceiling<00:01:52.549> and<00:01:52.789> the<00:01:52.880> bottom

00:01:53.529 --> 00:01:53.539 
space between the ceiling and the bottom

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:55.929 
space between the ceiling and the bottom
of<00:01:53.630> the<00:01:53.719> panel<00:01:53.960> so<00:01:54.920> again<00:01:55.460> we<00:01:55.609> just<00:01:55.759> worked

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:55.939 
of the panel so again we just worked

00:01:55.939 --> 00:01:58.209 
of the panel so again we just worked
with<00:01:56.090> finding<00:01:56.960> the<00:01:57.079> center<00:01:57.320> of<00:01:57.500> it<00:01:57.649> started

00:01:58.209 --> 00:01:58.219 
with finding the center of it started

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:59.800 
with finding the center of it started
the<00:01:58.369> center<00:01:58.549> screw<00:01:58.939> and<00:01:59.180> work<00:01:59.359> from<00:01:59.450> left<00:01:59.750> to

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
the center screw and work from left to

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:01.569 
the center screw and work from left to
right<00:02:00.079> cut<00:02:00.710> the<00:02:00.740> corners<00:02:01.159> like<00:02:01.310> you<00:02:01.399> saw<00:02:01.549> on

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:01.579 
right cut the corners like you saw on

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:06.279 
right cut the corners like you saw on
the<00:02:01.729> front<00:02:01.939> and<00:02:02.270> got<00:02:03.200> it<00:02:03.350> to<00:02:03.439> work<00:02:03.590> around<00:02:05.289> and

00:02:06.279 --> 00:02:06.289 
the front and got it to work around and

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:07.690 
the front and got it to work around and
we're<00:02:06.649> going<00:02:06.770> to<00:02:06.799> go<00:02:06.979> leave<00:02:07.159> it<00:02:07.280> sit<00:02:07.520> overnight

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
we're going to go leave it sit overnight

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.480 
we're going to go leave it sit overnight
in<00:02:08.149> the<00:02:08.539> upright<00:02:08.840> position<00:02:08.869> it's<00:02:09.830> pretty<00:02:10.250> taut

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:10.490 
in the upright position it's pretty taut

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:12.010
