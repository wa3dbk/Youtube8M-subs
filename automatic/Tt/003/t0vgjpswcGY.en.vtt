00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.180
 good let's discover this new 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:08.189
 model of the Chinese brand in the mx 4 then 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:12.509
 here we have this terminal arrived from 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:14.759
 china the meizu mx 4 as we see is a 

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:17.390
 large terminal with a screen 

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:19.609
 of 5.4 inches 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:22.460
 the materials used in this case 

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:25.130
 are the plastic in the back and the 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:27.289
 metal plastic on the sides 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:30.170
 on the left side we can 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:32.360
 find the volume buttons 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:35.120
 at the top the button 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:37.960
 turned on the noise reducer of the 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.960
 headphone input 

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:45.680
 and on the bottom the speakers the 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:49.100
 microphone and the usb port this port 

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:51.780
 usb also has mhl connection for 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:55.020
 connect our mobile to a television 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:56.969
 and it has connection or weaves that is to say we can 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:59.090
 connect a pendrive using a 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:00:59.090
 adapter 

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:05.190
 5.4 inch screen does not 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:09.010
 excessively large terminal since 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:10.810
 as we see, it takes advantage of the frames very well 

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:13.420
 It definitely has a pretty design 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:16.200
 elegant and attractive that reminds us of a 

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.200
 little to the iphone 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:21.320
 the screen as we have said is 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:26.850
 5.4 inches has a resolution of 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:28.500
 1920 x thousand 152 and a density of 418 what 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.970
 which provides a high quality of 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:34.110
 image 

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:36.460
 Besides, its weight of 147 grams makes 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.200
 be very easy to use 

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:40.690
 in terms of its technical characteristics 

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:45.119
 It has an 8-core processor 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:47.590
 mediatek specifically model 65 95 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:50.259
 we found four cores running with 

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:52.509
 2 gigahertz and others 4 to 1.7 

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:54.520
 gigahertz accompanied by 2 gigas of 

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:56.979
 ram what makes it a terminal 

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:59.890
 of the most powerful of the market giving 

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:03.600
 results in the high above the 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:07.570
 galaxy s 5 plus for the more gamers 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:10.179
 has a gpu power uve rg6 1200 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:12.010
 that offers great performance and also 

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:14.250
 It is customized especially for this 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.250
 terminal 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:19.870
 in the photographic section 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:23.290
 the camera that it mounts is a sensor 

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:25.150
 20 to 7 megapixel sonny with double 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.370
 LED flash and software 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.560
 processing that next to the interface 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.750
 which incorporates the camera allows many 

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.060
 manual adjustments providing a great 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:36.700
 quality of the photographs in the 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:42.060
 section of the recording we can record 

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:42.060
 in 720 in 1080 and in 4k 

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:49.310
 in other configurations we can 

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:51.130
 find the dlna nfc bluetooth wifi and 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.830
 gps 

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:57.460
 as we see it is based on the software 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:03:00.250
 android 4.4 kitkat but with a layer of 

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:02.940
 personalization of the law itself called 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:05.010
 flight os 

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.980
 it's a little bit different from what we are 

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:10.470
 used to find on android 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:12.980
 then change the settings menu 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:12.980
 icons 

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:18.690
 in section calls the 

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:21.420
 navigation between the screens but 

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:24.050
 good use is similar to any other 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:24.050
 Android terminal 

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:29.959
 to finish we are with a battery of 

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:32.420
 3100 milliamperes what allows to have 

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:35.090
 a great autonomy of up to a day with 

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:36.860
 normal use but keep in mind that 

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:38.990
 If we give him a lot of work, we have to 

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:41.030
 feed the screen the processor 

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:43.580
 etcetera then the consumption may 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:46.370
 shoot 

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:48.860
 to conclude saying that this terminal does not 

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:52.040
 supports sd cards since we can 

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:56.380
 find it in three different models 16 

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:58.660
 32 or 64 gb 

00:03:56.380 --> 00:04:00.640
 Well nothing friends if you liked the 

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:01.990
 terminal to any of 

00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.410
 our phone house stores for 

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:04.410
 acquire it
