 All over the country was able to see the figure of the run 

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:29.240
 However, the loser has advanced and now 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:32.870
 Even if you include static preservation, you can only count enough 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:38.199

 Luxury month Domo or station 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:54.500
 JNR 9600 steam locomotive next to this powerful station building 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:57.560
 Building guard log which can increase the request of popular name 96 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:00.290

 Passenger cars and freight cars are also on display 

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:09.400
 Of course you can also touch it in close proximity 

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:10.870
 The Kipa 25 jr rides and runs many people until the last day of the battle 

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:14.110
 It is a vehicle 

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:15.610
 This time the number of productions with this vehicle as a model 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:18.810
 Well then 

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:25.740
 Let's observe ha 20 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:27.690
 First of all, it is called the painted metropolitan area color that stands out remarkably but looks brighter than usual 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:31.800
 Two headlights 

00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:39.390
 It is called song light from a railway fan 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:40.620
 Reverse Humidity Minashiro There is a profound feeling when there is this sloppy and of a roof ventilator 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:47.710
 Staggered arrangement 

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:53.549
 The model of the roof is often viewed from above, so the representation of the roof is delicate including these points 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:53.549
 How does the husband and wife reproduce this fa 20 with a model 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:14.620

 This time seeder is kato made or 20 

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:29.280

 At first the vehicle disassembly 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:38.450
 This product is disassembled from the roof 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:38.450
 Be careful because the car body is so soft like this 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:50.110
 Point here 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:53.620
 Open a hole in the pin vise scraped off the railing of the door next to 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:55.060
 And put the wire in the shape of the handrail and bend it 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:03:02.610
 Bonding 

00:02:55.060 --> 00:03:02.610
 This time, I used the 0.35 mist dynamic wire purchased in the 100 yen shop 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:31.410
 Ah ah ah 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:36.990
 The handrail is a metal part and blows the surfacer first 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:39.530

 Let's keep in mind with a woman and divide it into several times without having a funnel at one time 

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:53.700
 This alone makes the look different 

00:03:46.980 --> 00:04:01.540
 The roof and the local radar are finished once by converting the ventilator into a separate part 

00:03:53.700 --> 00:04:06.450
 Finish the processing of the car body here Pull up the disassembled car body and paste the car number etc. in each part 

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:06.450
