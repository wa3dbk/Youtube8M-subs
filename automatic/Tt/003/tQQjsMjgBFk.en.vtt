standing wrap on a horse's leg the

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:30.250 
standing wrap on a horse's leg the
reason<00:00:28.760> we<00:00:28.880> do<00:00:29.029> this<00:00:29.210> is<00:00:29.270> so<00:00:29.480> that<00:00:29.930> we<00:00:30.110> can

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:30.260 
reason we do this is so that we can

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.050 
reason we do this is so that we can
provide<00:00:30.560> support<00:00:31.220> for<00:00:31.310> the<00:00:31.580> lower<00:00:31.760> limb

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:32.060 
provide support for the lower limb

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:33.460 
provide support for the lower limb
especially<00:00:32.720> if<00:00:32.780> the<00:00:32.870> horse<00:00:33.020> is<00:00:33.140> going<00:00:33.290> to<00:00:33.350> be
