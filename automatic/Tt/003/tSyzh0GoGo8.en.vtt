we've got a pretty cool paint job buddy
of<00:00:55.890> mine<00:00:56.100> here<00:00:56.399> in<00:00:56.520> stocking<00:00:57.059> digital<00:00:57.510> jobs

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:58.160 
of mine here in stocking digital jobs

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:04.700 
of mine here in stocking digital jobs
open<00:00:59.160> so<00:00:59.879> there's<00:01:00.120> the<00:01:00.300> other<00:01:00.390> door<00:01:03.710> it's

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
open so there's the other door it's

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.910 
open so there's the other door it's
about<00:01:04.860> it<00:01:05.250> i<00:01:05.489> think

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:06.920 
about it i think

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.800 
about it i think
so<00:01:07.520> this<00:01:07.700> thing<00:01:07.880> will<00:01:08.030> be<00:01:08.150> kicked<00:01:08.420> around<00:01:08.540> I

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:08.810 
so this thing will be kicked around I

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.950 
so this thing will be kicked around I
think<00:01:09.049> a<00:01:09.170> few<00:01:09.380> times<00:01:09.650> before<00:01:09.950> it's<00:01:10.750> broken<00:01:11.750> to

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:11.960 
think a few times before it's broken to

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.710 
think a few times before it's broken to
pieces<00:01:11.990> probably<00:01:13.090> and<00:01:14.090> it<00:01:14.210> sucks<00:01:14.420> for<00:01:14.540> the

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:14.720 
pieces probably and it sucks for the

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.690 
pieces probably and it sucks for the
paint<00:01:14.900> job<00:01:15.110> you<00:01:15.380> know<00:01:15.500> wasn't<00:01:16.220> a<00:01:16.280> cheap<00:01:16.490> paint

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:16.700 
paint job you know wasn't a cheap paint

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.929 
paint job you know wasn't a cheap paint
job<00:01:17.110> so<00:01:18.110> the<00:01:19.009> bottoms<00:01:19.369> already<00:01:19.670> kind<00:01:19.880> of

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:19.939 
job so the bottoms already kind of

00:01:19.939 --> 00:01:23.520 
job so the bottoms already kind of
busted<00:01:20.299> up<00:01:20.450> can't<00:01:21.229> see<00:01:21.409> it<00:01:21.940> down<00:01:22.940> by<00:01:23.119> the<00:01:23.180> leg

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:23.530 
busted up can't see it down by the leg

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:25.990 
busted up can't see it down by the leg
from<00:01:24.530> shipping<00:01:24.979> and<00:01:25.250> then<00:01:25.520> this<00:01:25.670> door

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.000 
from shipping and then this door

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.719 
from shipping and then this door
separated<00:01:26.780> actually<00:01:27.229> so<00:01:27.530> I'm<00:01:27.590> gonna<00:01:27.830> attempt

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:28.729 
separated actually so I'm gonna attempt

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:31.389 
separated actually so I'm gonna attempt
