00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Dear Lord and Father of mankind,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Forgive our foolish ways;

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Reclothe us in our rightful mind;

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
In purer lives Thy service find,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:42.000
In deeper reverence, praise,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:51.000
In deeper reverence, praise.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:59.000
In simple trust like theirs who heard,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Beside the Syrian sea,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:11.000
The gracious calling of the Lord,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Let us, like them, without a word

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Rise up and follow Thee,

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Rise up and follow Thee.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Drop Thy still dews of quietness,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Till all our strivings cease;

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Take from our souls the strain and stress,

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:06.000
And let our ordered lives confess

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.000
The beauty of Thy peace,

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:21.000
The beauty of Thy peace.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:30.000
Breathe through the heats of our desire

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Thy coolness and Thy balm;

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Let sense be dumb, let flesh retire;

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Speak through the earthquake, wind and fire,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.000
O still small voice of calm,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:04.000
O still small voice of calm!
