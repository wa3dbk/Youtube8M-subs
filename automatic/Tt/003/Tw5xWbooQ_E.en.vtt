we're<00:00:05.490> using<00:00:05.670> the<00:00:05.940> Z<00:00:06.150> aqua<00:00:06.540> 10<00:00:06.810> and<00:00:07.080> the<00:00:07.560> color

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
we're using the Z aqua 10 and the color

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.780 
we're using the Z aqua 10 and the color
we<00:00:07.980> came<00:00:08.280> up<00:00:08.490> with<00:00:08.730> is<00:00:09.030> five<00:00:09.719> parts<00:00:10.230> amber<00:00:10.790> one

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790 
we came up with is five parts amber one

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.780 
we came up with is five parts amber one
part<00:00:12.120> wheat<00:00:12.420> and<00:00:12.780> five<00:00:13.650> parts<00:00:14.130> water

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790

the<00:00:15.269> aquatint<00:00:15.809> is<00:00:16.049> water-soluble<00:00:16.890> so<00:00:17.279> you

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:17.340 
the aquatint is water-soluble so you

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:19.160 
the aquatint is water-soluble so you
could<00:00:17.640> dilute<00:00:18.060> these<00:00:18.330> colors<00:00:18.810> and<00:00:19.050> get

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:19.170 
could dilute these colors and get

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.650 
could dilute these colors and get
lighter<00:00:19.439> shades<00:00:19.890> of<00:00:20.130> any<00:00:20.279> of<00:00:20.430> our<00:00:20.580> colors<00:00:21.029> just

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
lighter shades of any of our colors just

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.040 
lighter shades of any of our colors just
by<00:00:21.840> adding<00:00:22.080> water<00:00:22.439> to<00:00:22.710> it

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:24.050

our<00:00:25.050> green<00:00:25.439> is<00:00:25.710> one<00:00:26.460> part<00:00:26.760> of<00:00:26.910> garden<00:00:27.449> and<00:00:27.750> five

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
our green is one part of garden and five

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:30.740 
our green is one part of garden and five
parts<00:00:28.560> of<00:00:28.740> water<00:00:28.980> because<00:00:29.670> we<00:00:29.849> sanded<00:00:30.330> this<00:00:30.510> to

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
parts of water because we sanded this to

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.580 
parts of water because we sanded this to
a<00:00:30.779> 220<00:00:31.439> grit<00:00:31.470> and<00:00:32.009> this<00:00:32.820> mix<00:00:33.360> is<00:00:33.570> so<00:00:33.809> dense<00:00:34.260> and

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:34.590 
a 220 grit and this mix is so dense and

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.709 
a 220 grit and this mix is so dense and
hard<00:00:34.829> we're<00:00:35.280> going<00:00:35.399> to<00:00:35.460> miss<00:00:35.730> the<00:00:35.969> entire<00:00:36.000> top

00:00:36.709 --> 00:00:36.719 
hard we're going to miss the entire top

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:39.920 
hard we're going to miss the entire top
with<00:00:37.079> water<00:00:37.790> to<00:00:38.790> open<00:00:39.180> up<00:00:39.300> the<00:00:39.450> pores

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
with water to open up the pores

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.810 
with water to open up the pores
that<00:00:40.710> way<00:00:40.860> it'll<00:00:41.040> allow<00:00:41.550> our<00:00:41.760> stain<00:00:43.070> to<00:00:44.070> get

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
that way it'll allow our stain to get

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.670 
that way it'll allow our stain to get
absorbed<00:00:45.450> better<00:00:45.690> into<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.260> concrete

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:47.680 
absorbed better into the concrete

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.790 
absorbed better into the concrete

there's<00:00:52.670> no<00:00:52.910> secrets<00:00:53.480> to<00:00:53.660> any<00:00:53.810> of<00:00:53.930> this<00:00:54.110> it's

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:54.380 
there's no secrets to any of this it's

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:57.670 
there's no secrets to any of this it's
just<00:00:54.620> whatever<00:00:55.250> you<00:00:55.550> feel<00:00:55.760> like<00:00:55.820> doing<00:00:56.680> then

00:00:57.670 --> 00:00:57.680 
just whatever you feel like doing then

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.560 
just whatever you feel like doing then
you<00:00:57.800> can<00:00:57.950> see<00:00:58.130> you<00:00:58.280> you<00:00:58.610> don't<00:00:58.640> have<00:00:59.120> to<00:00:59.180> have

00:00:59.560 --> 00:00:59.570 
you can see you you don't have to have

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:03.310 
you can see you you don't have to have
this<00:01:00.130> applied<00:01:01.130> like<00:01:01.430> paint<00:01:01.880> where<00:01:02.810> it's<00:01:02.960> one

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.320 
this applied like paint where it's one

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.240 
this applied like paint where it's one
solid<00:01:03.650> color<00:01:04.190> it<00:01:04.520> looks<00:01:04.790> a<00:01:04.940> lot<00:01:05.120> more<00:01:05.360> natural

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:06.250 
solid color it looks a lot more natural

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:09.180 
solid color it looks a lot more natural
and<00:01:07.250> you<00:01:07.340> could<00:01:07.520> blend<00:01:07.820> your<00:01:08.030> colors<00:01:08.090> together

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:09.190 
and you could blend your colors together

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:13.000 
and you could blend your colors together
let<00:01:10.190> one<00:01:10.430> run<00:01:10.700> into<00:01:11.060> the<00:01:11.210> other<00:01:11.390> one<00:01:12.010> when

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:13.010 
let one run into the other one when

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:14.680 
let one run into the other one when
you're<00:01:13.160> putting<00:01:13.460> it<00:01:13.550> on<00:01:13.640> to<00:01:13.970> don't<00:01:14.240> be<00:01:14.360> afraid

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:14.690 
you're putting it on to don't be afraid

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:16.420 
you're putting it on to don't be afraid
to<00:01:14.930> leave<00:01:15.140> some<00:01:15.410> puddles<00:01:15.650> in<00:01:15.979> it<00:01:16.130> because<00:01:16.400> that

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:16.430 
to leave some puddles in it because that

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:19.390 
to leave some puddles in it because that
will<00:01:16.700> create<00:01:17.229> darker<00:01:18.229> areas<00:01:18.710> in<00:01:18.890> the<00:01:19.010> finish

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:19.400 
will create darker areas in the finish

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.790 
will create darker areas in the finish
which<00:01:19.780> actually<00:01:20.780> in<00:01:20.869> the<00:01:20.990> end<00:01:21.170> looks<00:01:21.470> a<00:01:21.590> lot

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:21.800 
which actually in the end looks a lot

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.530 
which actually in the end looks a lot
nicer<00:01:22.450> the<00:01:23.450> aquatint<00:01:23.990> is<00:01:24.259> basically<00:01:24.979> a

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:25.540 
nicer the aquatint is basically a

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:29.859 
nicer the aquatint is basically a
water-based<00:01:26.540> dye<00:01:27.009> it<00:01:28.090> gets<00:01:29.090> absorbed<00:01:29.330> into

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:29.869 
water-based dye it gets absorbed into

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:37.270 
water-based dye it gets absorbed into
the<00:01:30.080> concrete<00:01:30.649> really<00:01:30.950> nice<00:01:35.860> first<00:01:36.860> time<00:01:37.130> you

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:37.280 
the concrete really nice first time you

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:38.499 
the concrete really nice first time you
do<00:01:37.430> this<00:01:37.610> you're<00:01:37.790> probably<00:01:38.000> going<00:01:38.270> to<00:01:38.330> be

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:38.509 
do this you're probably going to be

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:40.270 
do this you're probably going to be
afraid<00:01:38.810> that<00:01:38.960> you're<00:01:39.320> going<00:01:39.470> to<00:01:39.560> mess<00:01:39.770> up<00:01:39.800> what

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:40.280 
afraid that you're going to mess up what

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:45.430 
afraid that you're going to mess up what
you<00:01:40.640> really<00:01:40.820> can't<00:01:41.240> mess<00:01:41.450> up<00:01:41.690> here<00:01:44.350> and<00:01:45.350> you

00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:45.440 
you really can't mess up here and you

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.560 
you really can't mess up here and you
could<00:01:45.590> always<00:01:45.740> go<00:01:45.979> back<00:01:46.220> over<00:01:46.640> a<00:01:46.670> second<00:01:47.210> and<00:01:47.509> a

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:47.570 
could always go back over a second and a

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:50.109 
could always go back over a second and a
third<00:01:47.600> and<00:01:47.899> a<00:01:48.200> fourth<00:01:48.229> time<00:01:48.830> and<00:01:48.860> add<00:01:49.250> more

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:50.119 
third and a fourth time and add more

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:52.690 
third and a fourth time and add more
colors<00:01:50.600> to<00:01:50.860> to<00:01:51.860> give<00:01:52.040> it<00:01:52.160> the<00:01:52.310> look<00:01:52.460> you're

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:52.700 
colors to to give it the look you're

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:55.450 
colors to to give it the look you're
looking<00:01:52.729> for<00:01:53.450> now<00:01:54.200> you<00:01:54.259> can<00:01:54.470> see<00:01:54.649> when<00:01:54.830> you<00:01:54.950> put

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:55.460 
looking for now you can see when you put

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.910 
looking for now you can see when you put
down<00:01:55.850> and<00:01:56.179> you<00:01:56.840> leave<00:01:57.050> it<00:01:57.200> like<00:01:57.350> this

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
down and you leave it like this

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.279 
down and you leave it like this
you<00:01:58.910> let<00:01:59.119> that<00:01:59.300> soak<00:01:59.600> in<00:01:59.660> you'll<00:02:00.050> have<00:02:00.110> a

00:02:00.279 --> 00:02:00.289 
you let that soak in you'll have a

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:02.559 
you let that soak in you'll have a
darker<00:02:00.920> vein<00:02:01.220> going<00:02:01.550> through<00:02:01.970> here<00:02:02.240> of<00:02:02.390> the

00:02:02.559 --> 00:02:02.569 
darker vein going through here of the

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:05.830 
darker vein going through here of the
green<00:02:02.840> which<00:02:03.140> will<00:02:03.590> really<00:02:03.860> look<00:02:04.420> nice<00:02:05.420> when

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840 
green which will really look nice when

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.580 
green which will really look nice when
it<00:02:06.910> starts<00:02:07.910> to<00:02:08.179> dry<00:02:08.600> and<00:02:08.660> you<00:02:08.869> put<00:02:09.110> your<00:02:09.259> sealer

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
it starts to dry and you put your sealer

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.309 
it starts to dry and you put your sealer
over<00:02:09.770> it<00:02:10.250> because<00:02:10.429> the<00:02:10.550> sealer<00:02:10.819> will<00:02:11.319> bring

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319 
over it because the sealer will bring

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:16.540 
over it because the sealer will bring
out<00:02:12.500> these<00:02:12.770> colors<00:02:14.890> and<00:02:15.890> depending<00:02:16.340> on<00:02:16.400> what

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:16.550 
out these colors and depending on what

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.510 
out these colors and depending on what
kind<00:02:16.819> of<00:02:16.910> sealer<00:02:17.180> you<00:02:17.480> use<00:02:17.950> if<00:02:18.950> we<00:02:19.130> were<00:02:19.220> to<00:02:19.340> put

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:19.520 
kind of sealer you use if we were to put

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.690 
kind of sealer you use if we were to put
an<00:02:19.610> epoxy<00:02:20.000> sealer<00:02:20.540> on<00:02:20.900> this<00:02:21.200> it<00:02:22.010> would<00:02:22.160> darken
