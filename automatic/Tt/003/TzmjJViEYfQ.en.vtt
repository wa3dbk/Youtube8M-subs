really slowly and so if I in a month's

00:03:58.150 --> 00:03:59.940 
really slowly and so if I in a month's
time<00:03:58.390> I<00:03:58.450> really<00:03:58.900> wouldn't<00:03:59.110> have<00:03:59.290> that<00:03:59.500> much<00:03:59.740> of

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:14.250 
if you're not gonna make a razor stand I
hope<00:04:12.610> you<00:04:12.760> can<00:04:12.940> use<00:04:12.970> that<00:04:13.390> would<00:04:13.690> bidding

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260 
hope you can use that would bidding

hope you can use that would bidding
technique<00:04:14.800> I've<00:04:14.980> used<00:04:15.220> that<00:04:15.340> before<00:04:15.730> in

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:15.850 
technique I've used that before in

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:17.880 
technique I've used that before in
projects<00:04:16.359> and<00:04:16.510> I<00:04:16.600> I<00:04:16.900> think<00:04:17.140> it's<00:04:17.470> great<00:04:17.710> in

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:17.890 
projects and I I think it's great in

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:19.740 
projects and I I think it's great in
some<00:04:18.100> ways<00:04:18.280> it's<00:04:18.489> better<00:04:18.640> than<00:04:18.760> steam<00:04:19.270> bending

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:19.750 
some ways it's better than steam bending

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:21.420 
some ways it's better than steam bending
because<00:04:20.020> when<00:04:20.290> you<00:04:20.380> steamed<00:04:20.739> in<00:04:20.950> something

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:21.430 
because when you steamed in something

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:23.070 
because when you steamed in something
you<00:04:21.520> have<00:04:21.669> to<00:04:21.700> also<00:04:22.000> account<00:04:22.270> for<00:04:22.419> the<00:04:22.660> spring

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:23.080 
you have to also account for the spring

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:23.760 
you have to also account for the spring
back<00:04:23.350> on<00:04:23.590> it

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:23.770 
back on it

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:25.409 
back on it
but<00:04:23.860> when<00:04:23.949> you<00:04:24.039> just<00:04:24.069> glue<00:04:24.430> laminated<00:04:24.669> pieces

00:04:25.409 --> 00:04:25.419 
but when you just glue laminated pieces

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:27.480 
but when you just glue laminated pieces
together<00:04:25.569> there's<00:04:26.440> no<00:04:26.620> spring<00:04:26.949> back<00:04:27.250> let<00:04:27.430> me

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:27.490 
together there's no spring back let me

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:29.879 
together there's no spring back let me
give<00:04:27.610> you<00:04:27.699> my<00:04:27.819> TV<00:04:28.180> show<00:04:28.389> updates<00:04:28.629> tonight<00:04:29.410> is
