depressed wood but they're still holding
up<00:02:48.380> pretty<00:02:48.620> good<00:02:48.709> so<00:02:48.860> we're<00:02:49.700> not<00:02:49.850> gonna<00:02:49.970> screw

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:50.300

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:53.320 
up pretty good so we're not gonna screw
with<00:02:50.480> them<00:02:51.250> and<00:02:52.250> I'm<00:02:52.400> gonna<00:02:52.519> try<00:02:52.760> to<00:02:52.790> find<00:02:53.090> that

00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:53.330 
with them and I'm gonna try to find that

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:58.090 
with them and I'm gonna try to find that
a<00:02:53.360> stain<00:02:54.019> that<00:02:54.850> matches<00:02:56.410> this<00:02:57.410> color<00:02:57.739> so<00:02:58.040> I

00:02:58.090 --> 00:02:58.100 
a stain that matches this color so I

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:59.949 
a stain that matches this color so I
don't<00:02:58.310> have<00:02:58.430> to<00:02:58.610> refinish<00:02:58.970> all<00:02:59.300> the<00:02:59.510> cabinets

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
don't have to refinish all the cabinets

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:02.170 
don't have to refinish all the cabinets
and<00:03:00.080> of<00:03:00.200> course<00:03:00.580> this<00:03:01.580> here<00:03:01.820> can't<00:03:02.090> be

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:02.180 
and of course this here can't be

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.800 
and of course this here can't be
refinished<00:03:02.630> because<00:03:03.170> it's<00:03:03.380> not<00:03:03.650> real<00:03:03.980> wood

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:04.810 
refinished because it's not real wood

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:08.440 
refinished because it's not real wood
fake<00:03:05.810> good<00:03:06.080> so<00:03:06.850> the<00:03:07.850> doors<00:03:08.060> are<00:03:08.239> the<00:03:08.300> only

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:08.450 
fake good so the doors are the only

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:11.470 
fake good so the doors are the only
thing<00:03:08.600> that<00:03:08.690> can<00:03:08.810> really<00:03:09.080> be<00:03:09.350> refinished

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:11.480 
thing that can really be refinished

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.339

energy efficient all it is is a single

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:19.750 
energy efficient all it is is a single
pane<00:04:18.049> on<00:04:18.260> the<00:04:18.380> inside<00:04:18.799> and<00:04:19.250> then<00:04:19.489> on<00:04:19.609> the

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:27.350 
that one's broken and you can see we're

00:04:27.350 --> 00:04:29.110 
that one's broken and you can see we're
not<00:04:27.500> starting<00:04:27.889> to<00:04:28.130> rot<00:04:28.340> because<00:04:28.639> the<00:04:28.880> rains
