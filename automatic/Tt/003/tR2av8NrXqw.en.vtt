00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
hopefully he can be the kind of anchor

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.560 
hopefully he can be the kind of anchor
in<00:01:41.280> that<00:01:41.310> defense<00:01:41.790> getting<00:01:42.030> him<00:01:42.180> behind<00:01:42.270> the

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:42.570 
in that defense getting him behind the

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.660 
in that defense getting him behind the
two<00:01:42.810> that<00:01:43.020> slowest<00:01:43.590> and<00:01:43.799> cutting<00:01:44.430> out<00:01:44.520> the

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
two that slowest and cutting out the

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.280 
two that slowest and cutting out the
free<00:01:44.850> balls<00:01:45.149> i<00:01:45.299> never<00:01:45.479> told<00:01:45.689> you<00:01:45.810> this<00:01:45.960> yet<00:01:46.259> but

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
free balls i never told you this yet but

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.830 
free balls i never told you this yet but
i<00:01:46.470> hear<00:01:46.710> the<00:01:46.860> free<00:01:47.040> 52<00:01:47.430> formation<00:01:48.060> that<00:01:48.509> is<00:01:48.689> my

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
i hear the free 52 formation that is my

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:50.389 
i hear the free 52 formation that is my
worst<00:01:49.110> formation<00:01:49.649> to<00:01:49.710> play<00:01:49.860> on<00:01:49.950> the<00:01:50.040> game<00:01:50.220> i'm

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
worst formation to play on the game i'm

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.850 
worst formation to play on the game i'm
an<00:01:50.520> attacking<00:01:50.759> player<00:01:51.200> 352<00:01:52.200> i<00:01:52.229> think<00:01:52.590> if<00:01:52.740> you

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
an attacking player 352 i think if you

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.499 
an attacking player 352 i think if you
do<00:01:53.009> play<00:01:53.280> it<00:01:53.340> defensively<00:01:53.490> it's<00:01:54.210> the<00:01:54.299> most

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
do play it defensively it's the most

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:55.760 
do play it defensively it's the most
offensive<00:01:54.780> formation<00:01:55.170> on<00:01:55.530> the<00:01:55.560> game

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
offensive formation on the game

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.550 
offensive formation on the game

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
alongside the five at the back but yeah

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.230 
alongside the five at the back but yeah
it's<00:01:58.680> just<00:01:58.860> not<00:01:59.009> for<00:01:59.130> me<00:01:59.189> i<00:01:59.340> always<00:01:59.579> lose<00:02:00.060> in

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.630 
it's just not for me i always lose in
the<00:02:00.299> formation<00:02:00.659> but<00:02:00.930> so<00:02:01.200> far<00:02:01.439> this<00:02:01.619> series<00:02:02.009> so

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
the formation but so far this series so

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:04.850 
the formation but so far this series so
