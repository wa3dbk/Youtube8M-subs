00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:15.600 
but considering if you bartered it away

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.729 
but considering if you bartered it away
as<00:02:16.530> a<00:02:17.370> regular<00:02:17.880> sale<00:02:18.209> you'd<00:02:18.780> probably<00:02:18.989> end<00:02:19.380> up

00:02:19.729 --> 00:02:19.739 
as a regular sale you'd probably end up

00:02:19.739 --> 00:02:22.250 
as a regular sale you'd probably end up
making<00:02:19.950> much<00:02:20.250> less<00:02:20.550> for<00:02:20.819> it

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:22.260 
making much less for it

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.229 
making much less for it

so let's look at the map real quick this

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:25.970 
so let's look at the map real quick this
is<00:02:24.420> the<00:02:24.540> Ember<00:02:24.810> sharp<00:02:25.080> mind<00:02:25.380> that's<00:02:25.650> where<00:02:25.830> one

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
is the Ember sharp mind that's where one

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:28.520
