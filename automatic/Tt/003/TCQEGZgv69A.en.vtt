I have deployed molar methyl on the

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:56.770 
I have deployed molar methyl on the
right<00:01:54.950> side<00:01:55.280> and<00:01:55.550> like<00:01:55.940> based<00:01:56.150> on<00:01:56.420> left<00:01:56.660> side

and now like beat starts with a

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:07.060 
and now like beat starts with a
three-strike<00:02:00.440> forward<00:02:00.890> move<00:02:04.750> and<00:02:06.070> because

three-strike forward move and because

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.240 
three-strike forward move and because
that's<00:02:07.250> a<00:02:07.600> green<00:02:08.600> movement<00:02:08.899> he<00:02:09.470> gets<00:02:09.679> his<00:02:09.890> free

that's a green movement he gets his free
focus<00:02:10.640> and<00:02:10.940> then<00:02:11.240> straights<00:02:15.460> aft<00:02:16.460> that<00:02:16.820> molar

me fail activates moves three straight
forward<00:02:20.330> I<00:02:20.620> plan<00:02:21.620> on<00:02:21.650> going<00:02:22.040> with<00:02:22.370> four<00:02:22.730> but<00:02:23.510> I

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
forward I plan on going with four but I

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:28.510 
forward I plan on going with four but I
was<00:02:23.720> afraid<00:02:23.930> of<00:02:24.260> that<00:02:24.380> asteroid

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:28.520 

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.640 

and<00:02:29.520> after<00:02:29.849> his<00:02:29.970> movement<00:02:30.450> molar<00:02:30.930> methyl<00:02:31.319> also

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:31.650 
and after his movement molar methyl also

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.180 
and after his movement molar methyl also
gets<00:02:31.830> a<00:02:31.920> focus<00:02:32.310> because<00:02:33.500> of<00:02:34.500> the<00:02:34.620> scenario

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
gets a focus because of the scenario

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:38.030 
gets a focus because of the scenario
Luke<00:02:35.819> Skywalker<00:02:36.270> can<00:02:36.480> only<00:02:36.660> move<00:02:36.930> with<00:02:37.170> one<00:02:37.800> or

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
Luke Skywalker can only move with one or

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:39.920 
Luke Skywalker can only move with one or
two<00:02:38.069> movements<00:02:38.550> because<00:02:39.180> of<00:02:39.270> the<00:02:39.360> iron<00:02:39.660> cannon

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
two movements because of the iron cannon

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:43.970 
two movements because of the iron cannon
has<00:02:40.620> disabled<00:02:41.190> his<00:02:41.540> engines<00:02:42.680> so<00:02:43.680> he's<00:02:43.800> now

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
has disabled his engines so he's now

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:52.940 
has disabled his engines so he's now
taking<00:02:44.370> one<00:02:44.640> easy<00:02:44.910> right<00:02:50.360> and<00:02:51.860> after<00:02:52.860> the

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:52.950 
taking one easy right and after the

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:55.100 
taking one easy right and after the
movement<00:02:53.370> hit<00:02:53.550> target<00:02:53.940> locks<00:02:54.180> the<00:02:54.930> night

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:55.110 
movement hit target locks the night

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.720 
movement hit target locks the night
beast<00:02:57.709> then<00:02:58.709> it<00:02:58.860> straight<00:02:59.160> to<00:02:59.280> the<00:02:59.400> activation

00:02:59.720 --> 00:02:59.730 
beast then it straight to the activation

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:05.330 
beast then it straight to the activation
phase<00:03:00.709> so<00:03:01.709> Skywalker<00:03:02.420> starts<00:03:03.920> like<00:03:04.920> beast<00:03:05.190> is

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:05.340 
phase so Skywalker starts like beast is

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:08.660 
phase so Skywalker starts like beast is
within<00:03:05.580> range<00:03:06.510> of<00:03:06.690> one<00:03:06.900> so<00:03:07.530> an<00:03:07.860> additional<00:03:08.160> die

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
within range of one so an additional die

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.259 
within range of one so an additional die
to<00:03:09.120> hit<00:03:09.890> this<00:03:10.890> course<00:03:11.160> two<00:03:11.370> hits<00:03:11.580> and<00:03:11.730> to<00:03:11.819> focus

00:03:14.030 --> 00:03:14.040 
and because with target lock he can rear

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:19.220 
and because with target lock he can rear

started with night beast taking a one
heart<00:04:22.049> left<00:04:22.320> turn<00:04:22.620> trying<00:04:23.220> to<00:04:23.370> catch<00:04:23.550> Luke<00:04:23.880> I

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:28.850 

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:31.340 

thought<00:04:29.850> that<00:04:30.060> he<00:04:30.180> wouldn't<00:04:30.510> be<00:04:30.780> able<00:04:31.080> to

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:31.350 
thought that he wouldn't be able to

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:33.410 
thought that he wouldn't be able to
shoot<00:04:31.560> anybody<00:04:31.890> this<00:04:32.220> turn<00:04:32.490> so<00:04:32.700> I<00:04:32.910> take<00:04:33.240> an

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:33.420 
shoot anybody this turn so I take an

shoot anybody this turn so I take an
evade<00:04:36.650> now<00:04:37.650> it's<00:04:37.860> much<00:04:38.070> easier<00:04:38.460> to<00:04:38.610> see<00:04:38.820> that

00:04:39.290 --> 00:04:39.300 
evade now it's much easier to see that

00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.090 
evade now it's much easier to see that
male<00:04:39.510> method<00:04:39.870> is<00:04:39.960> not<00:04:40.140> going<00:04:40.350> to<00:04:40.470> hit<00:04:40.590> -<00:04:40.830> droid

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:41.100 
male method is not going to hit - droid

00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:45.050 
male method is not going to hit - droid
so<00:04:41.610> I<00:04:41.700> go<00:04:41.940> for<00:04:42.300> straightforward<00:04:44.030> ideally<00:04:45.030> I

00:04:45.050 --> 00:04:45.060 
so I go for straightforward ideally I

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:47.630 
so I go for straightforward ideally I
should<00:04:45.360> have<00:04:45.510> moved<00:04:45.780> 5<00:04:46.110> but<00:04:46.890> at<00:04:47.040> the<00:04:47.130> time<00:04:47.370> I

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:47.640 
should have moved 5 but at the time I

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:49.880 
should have moved 5 but at the time I
didn't<00:04:48.180> notice<00:04:48.780> or<00:04:49.020> remember<00:04:49.050> that<00:04:49.650> there<00:04:49.860> is

00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:49.890 
didn't notice or remember that there is

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:54.590 
didn't notice or remember that there is
a<00:04:49.980> 5<00:04:52.010> after<00:04:53.010> the<00:04:53.340> movement<00:04:53.700> male<00:04:53.970> method<00:04:54.330> takes

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:54.600 
a 5 after the movement male method takes

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:57.999 
a 5 after the movement male method takes
focus

00:04:57.999 --> 00:04:58.009 

00:04:58.009 --> 00:05:01.189 

then<00:04:59.009> his<00:04:59.159> flukes<00:04:59.430> turn<00:04:59.729> to<00:04:59.879> take<00:05:00.030> to<00:05:00.300> his<00:05:00.539> left

00:05:01.189 --> 00:05:01.199 
then his flukes turn to take to his left

00:05:01.199 --> 00:05:03.649 
then his flukes turn to take to his left
but<00:05:01.469> when<00:05:01.650> doing<00:05:01.919> this<00:05:02.189> he<00:05:02.699> also<00:05:02.819> clips<00:05:03.240> with<00:05:03.449> a

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:15.360 
strode taking a damage role and here you

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:17.959 
strode taking a damage role and here you
can<00:05:15.509> see<00:05:15.689> the<00:05:15.779> damage<00:05:15.930> role<00:05:16.289> and<00:05:16.560> it's<00:05:16.830> hit<00:05:17.009> so

00:05:17.959 --> 00:05:17.969 
can see the damage role and it's hit so

00:05:17.969 --> 00:05:20.420 
can see the damage role and it's hit so
one<00:05:18.150> damage<00:05:18.509> and<00:05:18.749> Luke<00:05:19.349> is<00:05:19.560> with<00:05:19.979> one<00:05:20.219> hit

point after that Luke takes focus thence
again<00:05:26.189> activation<00:05:26.969> phase<00:05:27.150> so<00:05:27.449> Luke<00:05:27.629> has<00:05:27.840> to
