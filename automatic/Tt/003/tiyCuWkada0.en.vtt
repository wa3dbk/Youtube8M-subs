00:00:57.650 --> 00:00:57.660 
this area was a really difficult like I

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:58.970 
this area was a really difficult like I
was<00:00:57.840> out<00:00:57.960> this<00:00:58.079> part<00:00:58.320> for<00:00:58.440> probably<00:00:58.680> two<00:00:58.920> hours

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
was out this part for probably two hours

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.520 
was out this part for probably two hours
when<00:00:59.370> I<00:00:59.399> first<00:00:59.670> did<00:00:59.880> it<00:01:00.030> but<00:01:00.239> um<00:01:00.450> so<00:01:01.260> yeah<00:01:01.380> this

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:01.530 
when I first did it but um so yeah this

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:02.720 
when I first did it but um so yeah this
glitch<00:01:01.739> can<00:01:01.890> allow<00:01:02.070> you<00:01:02.130> to<00:01:02.280> get<00:01:02.370> past<00:01:02.550> this

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:02.730 
glitch can allow you to get past this

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.520 
glitch can allow you to get past this
area<00:01:03.000> a<00:01:03.030> lot<00:01:03.480> simpler<00:01:03.930> so<00:01:04.199> what<00:01:04.320> you<00:01:04.379> have<00:01:04.469> to

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:04.530 
area a lot simpler so what you have to

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.050 
area a lot simpler so what you have to
do<00:01:04.710> is<00:01:04.890> basically<00:01:05.129> just<00:01:05.339> climb<00:01:05.700> on<00:01:05.729> top<00:01:06.000> of

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
do is basically just climb on top of

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.490 
do is basically just climb on top of
this<00:01:06.210> table<00:01:06.420> over<00:01:06.689> here<00:01:06.810> in<00:01:06.960> the<00:01:07.049> corner<00:01:07.380> and

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
this table over here in the corner and

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.920 
this table over here in the corner and
then<00:01:08.130> jump<00:01:08.490> on<00:01:08.579> top<00:01:08.790> of<00:01:08.909> this<00:01:08.969> box<00:01:09.210> I<00:01:09.420> recommend

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
then jump on top of this box I recommend

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.569 
then jump on top of this box I recommend
practicing<00:01:10.140> this<00:01:10.530> before<00:01:10.920> actually<00:01:11.280> trying

00:01:11.569 --> 00:01:11.579 
practicing this before actually trying

00:01:11.579 --> 00:01:14.090 
practicing this before actually trying
to<00:01:11.670> do<00:01:11.880> this<00:01:12.060> just<00:01:12.960> simply<00:01:13.320> like<00:01:13.530> climb<00:01:13.799> on<00:01:13.950> top

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:14.100 
to do this just simply like climb on top

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.620 
to do this just simply like climb on top
and<00:01:14.340> once<00:01:14.670> you<00:01:14.790> get<00:01:14.909> the<00:01:15.000> spa<00:01:15.210> just<00:01:15.420> kind<00:01:15.600> of

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
and once you get the spa just kind of

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:16.940 
and once you get the spa just kind of
practice<00:01:16.020> it<00:01:16.170> you'll<00:01:16.289> get<00:01:16.499> the<00:01:16.590> hang<00:01:16.740> of<00:01:16.829> it

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
practice it you'll get the hang of it

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.679 
practice it you'll get the hang of it
but<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:17.249> only<00:01:17.369> part<00:01:17.639> that<00:01:17.670> you<00:01:17.789> have<00:01:17.850> to<00:01:18.090> take

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
but the only part that you have to take

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:19.819 
but the only part that you have to take
into<00:01:18.840> account<00:01:18.929> when<00:01:19.289> you're<00:01:19.350> up<00:01:19.439> here<00:01:19.469> is<00:01:19.709> you

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:56.730 
Hillyer that when I did on the ps4

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.610 
Hillyer that when I did on the ps4
version<00:02:56.939> it<00:02:57.450> took<00:02:57.599> me<00:02:57.720> a<00:02:57.810> lot<00:02:58.079> at<00:02:58.319> like<00:02:58.500> I'm

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
version it took me a lot at like I'm

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.349 
version it took me a lot at like I'm
only<00:02:58.739> a<00:02:58.859> half<00:02:59.010> hour<00:02:59.189> to<00:02:59.430> me<00:02:59.519> a<00:02:59.549> lot<00:02:59.730> less<00:02:59.970> but

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:00.359 
only a half hour to me a lot less but

00:03:00.359 --> 00:03:03.199 
only a half hour to me a lot less but
then<00:03:01.170> we<00:03:01.290> then<00:03:01.980> drew<00:03:02.549> kind<00:03:02.849> of<00:03:02.909> found<00:03:03.060> this

00:03:03.199 --> 00:03:03.209 
then we then drew kind of found this

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:04.940 
then we then drew kind of found this
glitch<00:03:03.419> going<00:03:03.629> on<00:03:03.689> top<00:03:03.870> this<00:03:04.049> table<00:03:04.470> so<00:03:04.650> and

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:04.950 
glitch going on top this table so and

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:06.530 
glitch going on top this table so and
when<00:03:05.069> we<00:03:05.340> just<00:03:05.579> decide<00:03:05.939> to<00:03:05.970> record<00:03:06.180> it<00:03:06.450> because

00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:06.540 
when we just decide to record it because

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:07.970 
when we just decide to record it because
I<00:03:06.720> know<00:03:06.959> there's<00:03:07.290> a<00:03:07.319> lot<00:03:07.379> of<00:03:07.500> people<00:03:07.709> that<00:03:07.859> do

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:07.980 
I know there's a lot of people that do

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:09.530 
I know there's a lot of people that do
you<00:03:08.040> go<00:03:08.159> for<00:03:08.310> the<00:03:08.340> trophies<00:03:08.730> and<00:03:08.760> try<00:03:09.030> to<00:03:09.090> brown

you go for the trophies and try to brown

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.629 
you go for the trophies and try to brown
it<00:03:09.689> mode<00:03:09.870> and<00:03:10.709> like<00:03:10.919> you<00:03:11.010> guys<00:03:11.129> don't<00:03:11.400> have<00:03:11.459> to

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:11.639 
it mode and like you guys don't have to

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:13.009 
it mode and like you guys don't have to
do<00:03:11.819> it<00:03:11.939> if<00:03:12.030> you<00:03:12.120> guys<00:03:12.209> want<00:03:12.419> to<00:03:12.480> do<00:03:12.540> it<00:03:12.629> legit<00:03:12.900> do

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.019 
do it if you guys want to do it legit do

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:14.539 
do it if you guys want to do it legit do
it<00:03:13.139> legit<00:03:13.439> but<00:03:13.650> this<00:03:13.950> just<00:03:14.220> kind<00:03:14.430> of<00:03:14.459> an

00:03:14.539 --> 00:03:14.549 
it legit but this just kind of an

00:03:14.549 --> 00:03:16.759 
it legit but this just kind of an
alternative<00:03:14.970> method<00:03:15.239> to<00:03:15.629> doing<00:03:16.470> it<00:03:16.530> because

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:16.769 
alternative method to doing it because

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:19.640 
alternative method to doing it because
it<00:03:17.040> is<00:03:17.250> a<00:03:17.280> hell<00:03:17.819> of<00:03:18.269> a<00:03:18.659> lot<00:03:18.870> harder<00:03:18.900> to<00:03:19.379> do<00:03:19.500> it

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:19.650 
it is a hell of a lot harder to do it

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:20.960 
it is a hell of a lot harder to do it
without<00:03:19.799> this<00:03:20.129> doing<00:03:20.370> this<00:03:20.489> glitch<00:03:20.669> because

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:20.970 
without this doing this glitch because

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:22.819 
without this doing this glitch because
this<00:03:21.150> makes<00:03:21.329> it<00:03:21.450> so<00:03:21.810> simple<00:03:21.840> it<00:03:22.349> just<00:03:22.500> makes<00:03:22.709> it

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:22.829 
this makes it so simple it just makes it

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:25.129 
this makes it so simple it just makes it
look<00:03:23.010> just<00:03:23.909> pitiful<00:03:24.299> compared<00:03:24.659> to<00:03:24.810> like<00:03:24.959> how

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:25.139 
look just pitiful compared to like how

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:27.440 
look just pitiful compared to like how
hard<00:03:25.950> it<00:03:26.069> is<00:03:26.129> normally<00:03:26.579> but<00:03:26.819> like<00:03:26.970> when<00:03:27.180> the

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
hard it is normally but like when the

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:28.460 
hard it is normally but like when the
only<00:03:27.629> part<00:03:27.810> you<00:03:27.840> have<00:03:27.959> to<00:03:27.989> be<00:03:28.079> concerned<00:03:28.379> about

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:28.470 
only part you have to be concerned about

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.259 
only part you have to be concerned about
here<00:03:28.859> is<00:03:28.980> the<00:03:29.129> blowdark<00:03:29.430> so<00:03:29.639> the<00:03:29.729> bloater<00:03:29.940> can

00:03:30.259 --> 00:03:30.269 
here is the blowdark so the bloater can

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:33.080 
here is the blowdark so the bloater can
occasionally<00:03:30.930> throw<00:03:31.739> a<00:03:31.769> little<00:03:32.099> spore<00:03:32.579> ball

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
occasionally throw a little spore ball

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:34.939 
occasionally throw a little spore ball
things<00:03:33.419> at<00:03:33.629> you<00:03:33.780> which<00:03:34.019> can<00:03:34.290> hurt<00:03:34.560> you<00:03:34.680> a<00:03:34.709> lot

and nail bomb then you get from the
beginning<00:03:38.430> and<00:03:39.120> make<00:03:39.720> sure<00:03:39.840> you<00:03:39.900> have<00:03:39.989> one

00:03:41.689 --> 00:03:41.699 
rifle shot because taking out the blower

00:03:41.699 --> 00:03:43.909 
rifle shot because taking out the blower
should<00:03:41.879> only<00:03:41.970> take<00:03:42.209> one<00:03:43.199> balls<00:03:43.409> off<00:03:43.590> and<00:03:43.799> one

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:45.030 
nail bomb in one rifle shot and you

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:46.430 
nail bomb in one rifle shot and you
should<00:03:45.209> take<00:03:45.359> them<00:03:45.510> down<00:03:45.659> instantly<00:03:46.019> if<00:03:46.229> not

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
should take them down instantly if not

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:47.839 
should take them down instantly if not
you<00:03:46.650> can<00:03:46.799> probably<00:03:47.129> jump<00:03:47.310> down<00:03:47.459> this<00:03:47.609> part

00:03:47.839 --> 00:03:47.849 
you can probably jump down this part

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:49.849 
you can probably jump down this part
there's<00:03:48.030> not<00:03:48.150> many<00:03:48.239> enemies<00:03:48.629> that<00:03:48.810> but<00:03:49.109> there

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:49.859 
there's not many enemies that but there

00:03:49.859 --> 00:03:50.869 
there's not many enemies that but there
are<00:03:49.979> gonna<00:03:50.099> be<00:03:50.190> some<00:03:50.310> times<00:03:50.519> where<00:03:50.699> you<00:03:50.760> might

00:03:50.869 --> 00:03:50.879 
are gonna be some times where you might

00:03:50.879 --> 00:03:52.189 
are gonna be some times where you might
have<00:03:50.909> to<00:03:51.120> jump<00:03:51.329> down<00:03:51.389> but<00:03:51.659> hopefully<00:03:52.079> you<00:03:52.139> can

00:03:52.189 --> 00:03:52.199 
have to jump down but hopefully you can

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:54.170 
have to jump down but hopefully you can
limit<00:03:52.530> that<00:03:52.650> to<00:03:52.680> a<00:03:52.859> minimal<00:03:53.760> amount<00:03:53.849> because

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
limit that to a minimal amount because

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:58.250 
limit that to a minimal amount because
it<00:03:55.169> just<00:03:55.409> risk<00:03:55.680> dying<00:03:55.949> so<00:03:56.340> I<00:03:56.840> hope<00:03:57.840> this<00:03:57.989> helps

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
it just risk dying so I hope this helps

00:03:58.260 --> 00:03:59.509 
it just risk dying so I hope this helps
