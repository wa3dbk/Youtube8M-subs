00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.350
 hi friends, how are you? 

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:18.720
 of the best and welcome to an oblivion of 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.000
 minecraft in which I bring you a new 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.650
 so that if you want 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.180
 transport chests in minecraft 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.680
 this is a proper mode really 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.090
 because you can work pretty 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:28.770
 enough channels means that without 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.740
 listen a little weird that surely 

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:33.030
 they're going to listen to it because it's because you can 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.550
 Now I have a little throat like that 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.230
 I eat like I snore not then 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.540
 that you hear me a little weird but not 

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.809
 for a sacred a pocket and then it 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:45.150
 will call chest that is a hat a 

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.860
 hat of a chest then so that 

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:48.089
 functions in this way they have 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.309
 many things in a chest and what 

00:00:48.089 --> 00:00:52.979
 you want to transport what you want to move 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.019
 this mutated works enough to not 

00:00:52.979 --> 00:00:56.610
 save all the inventory and then go to 

00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:58.440
 leave your house then again back 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.000
 I would keep it you touch again then 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:01.860
 place to make many many moves 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.739
 because with this type of carries a chest 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:06.570
 complete in the place where the helmet goes 

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:10.080
 so then you practically put it on 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.560
 of the hat the super chest instead of 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.930
 helmet 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:14.300
 so if you have a helmet you can not 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.710
 do this 

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:18.560
 because he explains that what you have to 

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:20.270
 to do is to take off the helmet 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:23.000
 bend over and right click and 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:25.420
 automatically good I dropped all the 

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.830
 chest I just fell from the golf r 

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.570
 Well the point is that you pick up the chest 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:30.680
 you can wear it as a hat and 

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:32.960
 You can take where you want to go to 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.760
 put everything again if they have the helmet 

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.110
 since obviously you can not not 

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.510
 you can do is super strategy 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:42.380
 because then the helmet occupies the place 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:43.880
 of the chest then you bend over and start 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.640
 to walk 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.500
 or rays I'm good at is that the joke 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.750
 of this module that I do not know if you did well 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.670
 but good the point is that it has a balance 

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:55.220
 and if you are 7-year balance and the 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.710
 chest then I do not know if it has logic that 

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:59.210
 this unbalance the chest that you drop 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:01.460
 but good if you have some logic 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.500
 there is no longer no longer callus is me 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:06.380
 that if I stay still it's just 

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:08.239
 flipping down this where I just 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.250
 grabbing a chest is going to fall 

00:02:08.239 --> 00:02:12.040
 can you see I have a meter if I 

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.360
 I keep in the center everything is fine 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:17.900
 then although keep looking towards 

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:20.900
 opposite and normal walking 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.909
 then if I'm not going to fall if fat 

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.980
 up the meter is uploaded to the 

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:27.829
 Red part if its super part 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.689
 red I drop the chest and yes and the same 

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:31.519
 with the turn down it 's pretty much 

00:02:29.689 --> 00:02:33.349
 as logically if bolt or very for 

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:35.060
 above the chest is going to fall if car very 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:37.700
 work that offers to fall also 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.019
 then you have to be very careful you 

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.299
 you can duck what you want 

00:02:39.019 --> 00:02:44.480
 you can jump whatever you want to run but 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:46.939
 if you run this you can fall down then 

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:48.470
 as you can see the blue bar is 

00:02:46.939 --> 00:02:51.470
 start filling and they knew up 

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:53.990
 um you drop then often 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:56.030
 goodbye that offers I shut up all this what 

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:57.770
 you can modify in the in the 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:59.870
 mode configuration but good if it's 

00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:02.360
 another topic you do not have to get inside 

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:04.130
 of the mod and remove it then this option 

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:05.720
 suppose you can do it just in case 

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:07.190
 true really the options that are 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.380
 dropping the reel box and all the 

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:10.760
 things picking up but good once 

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:12.530
 who learns uses this mode the doors 

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:13.940
 portal chests well a way much 

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:15.260
 much simpler 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:18.260
 although massa by the mail because then 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:20.630
 it is to fall this but possible if it is then 

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:22.520
 transport box from a place not very 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:25.550
 You can go walking and go 

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:27.290
 to leave and so on not then 

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:29.190
 well let's fill it again a 

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:31.430
 bit 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:34.219
 Light 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:36.580
 we charge it when it has to be 

00:03:34.219 --> 00:03:40.030
 a hand towards decision 

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:42.640
 we load the chest and then to put 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:45.250
 on the floor is porridge and right click on 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:47.620
 the floor there is and you put it and follow 

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:49.090
 just as full as accommodated as 

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:51.310
 we leave it then well 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:53.890
 practically this is today's mode and 

00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:55.870
 it is still change yes yes yes it has 

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:58.319
 been very rare but we can not people 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:01.140
 matter the truth this 

00:03:58.319 --> 00:04:01.499
 It is already so calm if you are interested 

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:03.900
 the mod 

00:04:01.499 --> 00:04:06.299
 in the description I leave you the link 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.680
 so they know with the installer and so 

00:04:06.299 --> 00:04:09.749
 how much in this mode in question of 

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:12.150
 second gentlemen if you like we are going to 

00:04:09.749 --> 00:04:13.739
 leave a like and nothing else we go to 

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:16.159
