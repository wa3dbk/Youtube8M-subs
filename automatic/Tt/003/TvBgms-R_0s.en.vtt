00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
getting there effectively are we picking

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:34.040 
getting there effectively are we picking
the<00:00:32.759> right<00:00:32.940> amount<00:00:33.180> of<00:00:33.239> time<00:00:33.480> spending<00:00:33.960> with

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
the right amount of time spending with

the right amount of time spending with
customers<00:00:34.440> versus<00:00:34.800> driving<00:00:35.160> on<00:00:35.280> the<00:00:35.340> road<00:00:35.489> so

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:35.700 
customers versus driving on the road so

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.209 
customers versus driving on the road so
it's<00:00:36.300> an<00:00:36.450> intelligence-gathering<00:00:36.960> tool<00:00:37.559> we

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
it's an intelligence-gathering tool we

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:39.650 
it's an intelligence-gathering tool we
manufactured<00:00:38.910> technology<00:00:39.420> that<00:00:39.540> gets

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
manufactured technology that gets

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.360 
manufactured technology that gets
installed<00:00:40.050> in<00:00:40.230> the<00:00:40.290> vehicle<00:00:40.649> to<00:00:40.920> collect<00:00:41.250> all

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:41.370 
installed in the vehicle to collect all

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:42.619 
installed in the vehicle to collect all
that<00:00:41.520> information<00:00:42.030> and<00:00:42.120> then<00:00:42.239> we<00:00:42.329> have<00:00:42.480> an

00:00:42.619 --> 00:00:42.629 
that information and then we have an

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:45.229 
that information and then we have an
end-to-end<00:00:42.870> system<00:00:43.590> to<00:00:44.399> deliver<00:00:44.940> that<00:00:45.090> data

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
end-to-end system to deliver that data

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:46.910 
end-to-end system to deliver that data
into<00:00:45.539> a<00:00:45.570> computer<00:00:45.629> on<00:00:46.170> a<00:00:46.230> cloud-based

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
into a computer on a cloud-based

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.440 
into a computer on a cloud-based
environment<00:00:47.340> so<00:00:47.700> people<00:00:47.910> can<00:00:48.000> mine<00:00:48.149> the<00:00:48.300> data

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
environment so people can mine the data

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.740 
environment so people can mine the data
and<00:00:48.660> then<00:00:48.809> look<00:00:49.020> at<00:00:49.110> it<00:00:49.340> so<00:00:50.340> so<00:00:50.850> you<00:00:51.449> find

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
and then look at it so so you find

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.549 
and then look at it so so you find
better<00:00:52.320> routes<00:00:52.710> for<00:00:53.070> them<00:00:53.399> or<00:00:54.230> exactly<00:00:55.230> what

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
better routes for them or exactly what

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.439 
better routes for them or exactly what
so<00:00:56.129> yeah<00:00:56.309> we're<00:00:56.460> measuring<00:00:56.610> how<00:00:57.000> to<00:00:57.059> get<00:00:57.329> from

00:00:57.439 --> 00:00:57.449 
so yeah we're measuring how to get from

00:00:57.449 --> 00:00:59.209 
so yeah we're measuring how to get from
point<00:00:57.629> a<00:00:57.809> point<00:00:58.289> A<00:00:58.410> to<00:00:58.530> point<00:00:58.620> B<00:00:58.829> but<00:00:58.980> the<00:00:59.070> more

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219 
point a point A to point B but the more

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:01.670 
point a point A to point B but the more
important<00:00:59.640> aspect<00:01:00.030> is<00:01:00.180> we're<00:01:01.109> trying<00:01:01.379> to<00:01:01.469> go

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
important aspect is we're trying to go

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.319 
important aspect is we're trying to go
and<00:01:01.859> organize<00:01:02.070> customers<00:01:02.940> better<00:01:03.149> we're

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
and organize customers better we're

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:04.850 
and organize customers better we're
helping<00:01:03.539> customer<00:01:03.930> our<00:01:04.379> customers

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
helping customer our customers

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.710 
helping customer our customers
understand<00:01:05.369> their<00:01:06.180> customer<00:01:06.630> activity

understand their customer activity

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.140 
understand their customer activity
better<00:01:07.170> what's<00:01:07.560> actually<00:01:07.799> happening<00:01:08.549> from

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
better what's actually happening from

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.390 
better what's actually happening from
8:00<00:01:09.390> a.m.<00:01:09.450> until<00:01:09.900> 5:00<00:01:10.320> p.m.<00:01:10.350> throughout<00:01:11.159> the
