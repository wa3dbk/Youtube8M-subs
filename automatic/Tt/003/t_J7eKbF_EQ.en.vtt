put up with it before the wreck happened
do<00:02:01.130> you<00:02:01.160> think<00:02:01.399> you<00:02:01.490> had<00:02:01.610> a<00:02:01.640> truck<00:02:01.910> good<00:02:02.090> enough

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:02.300 
do you think you had a truck good enough

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.389 
do you think you had a truck good enough
to<00:02:02.420> win<00:02:02.600> I<00:02:02.810> don't<00:02:03.440> know<00:02:03.500> tram<00:02:03.830> positions<00:02:04.280> way

00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:04.399 
to win I don't know tram positions way

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:06.210 
to win I don't know tram positions way
too<00:02:04.460> important<00:02:05.119> you<00:02:05.270> know<00:02:05.360> with<00:02:05.570> these<00:02:05.660> trucks

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:06.220 
too important you know with these trucks

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:08.800 
too important you know with these trucks
here<00:02:07.220> the<00:02:07.490> motors<00:02:07.850> the<00:02:07.880> gears<00:02:08.300> everything

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
here the motors the gears everything

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:10.029 
here the motors the gears everything
we've<00:02:08.929> got

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:10.039 
we've got

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:12.789 
we've got
wrong<00:02:10.189> tire<00:02:10.519> for<00:02:10.849> here<00:02:11.030> so<00:02:11.360> just<00:02:11.620> really<00:02:12.620> hard

00:02:12.789 --> 00:02:12.799 
wrong tire for here so just really hard

00:02:12.799 --> 00:02:14.440 
wrong tire for here so just really hard
to<00:02:12.860> pass<00:02:13.099> but<00:02:13.400> anything<00:02:13.879> can<00:02:13.939> happen<00:02:14.090> you<00:02:14.390> know

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:14.450 
to pass but anything can happen you know

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:15.789 
to pass but anything can happen you know
you<00:02:14.540> can<00:02:14.810> certainly<00:02:15.109> make<00:02:15.290> moves<00:02:15.530> through

00:02:15.789 --> 00:02:15.799 
you can certainly make moves through

00:02:15.799 --> 00:02:18.099 
you can certainly make moves through
traffic<00:02:16.069> I<00:02:16.459> felt<00:02:17.209> like<00:02:17.329> we<00:02:17.450> were<00:02:17.480> probably<00:02:17.719> the

00:02:18.099 --> 00:02:18.109 
traffic I felt like we were probably the

00:02:18.109 --> 00:02:20.259 
traffic I felt like we were probably the
best<00:02:18.290> structure<00:02:18.530> in<00:02:18.769> practice<00:02:19.189> but<00:02:19.400> doesn't

00:02:20.259 --> 00:02:20.269 
best structure in practice but doesn't

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:21.910 
best structure in practice but doesn't
matter<00:02:20.329> right<00:02:20.510> now<00:02:20.659> they<00:02:21.379> had<00:02:21.500> worked<00:02:21.709> on<00:02:21.859> the

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:21.920 
matter right now they had worked on the

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:23.770 
matter right now they had worked on the
truck<00:02:22.219> to<00:02:22.370> try<00:02:22.519> to<00:02:22.579> get<00:02:22.790> it<00:02:22.879> back<00:02:23.030> in<00:02:23.269> Kyle<00:02:23.540> out

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:23.780 
truck to try to get it back in Kyle out

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:25.720 
truck to try to get it back in Kyle out
obviously<00:02:24.590> they<00:02:24.769> are<00:02:24.829> not<00:02:25.069> going<00:02:25.310> to<00:02:25.370> get<00:02:25.489> back

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:25.730 
obviously they are not going to get back

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:29.200 
obviously they are not going to get back
in<00:02:26.000> and<00:02:26.239> get<00:02:26.390> any<00:02:26.689> extra<00:02:27.049> points
