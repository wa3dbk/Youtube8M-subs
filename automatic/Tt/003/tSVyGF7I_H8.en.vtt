00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:49.000 

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.789 

that<00:01:50.000> way<00:01:50.180> if<00:01:50.840> you<00:01:51.020> were<00:01:51.140> in<00:01:51.200> standard<00:01:51.560> tuning

00:01:51.789 --> 00:01:51.799 
that way if you were in standard tuning

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:53.289 
that way if you were in standard tuning
you<00:01:51.890> couldn't<00:01:52.189> get<00:01:52.310> away<00:01:52.400> with<00:01:52.520> that<00:01:52.670> the<00:01:53.060> top

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:53.299 
you couldn't get away with that the top

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:55.180 
you couldn't get away with that the top
string<00:01:53.540> would<00:01:53.630> sound<00:01:53.840> bad<00:01:54.020> so<00:01:54.560> this<00:01:54.740> is<00:01:54.920> a<00:01:54.950> D

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:55.190 
string would sound bad so this is a D

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:57.030
