00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
extra mile for you if you need a teacher

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.650 
extra mile for you if you need a teacher
they<00:02:11.370> will<00:02:11.520> definitely<00:02:11.670> be<00:02:12.030> there<00:02:12.209> for<00:02:12.480> you

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
they will definitely be there for you

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.600 
they will definitely be there for you
and<00:02:12.930> it's<00:02:13.140> very<00:02:13.230> easy<00:02:13.500> to<00:02:13.830> develop<00:02:14.100> a<00:02:14.400> strong

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:14.610 
and it's very easy to develop a strong

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:16.670 
and it's very easy to develop a strong
relationship<00:02:15.090> with<00:02:15.270> a<00:02:15.420> teacher<00:02:15.660> so<00:02:16.380> the

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:16.680 
relationship with a teacher so the

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:17.960 
relationship with a teacher so the
classes<00:02:17.040> that<00:02:17.070> will<00:02:17.310> in<00:02:17.489> high<00:02:17.640> school

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
classes that will in high school

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.000 
classes that will in high school
definitely<00:02:18.180> set<00:02:18.570> a<00:02:18.600> basis<00:02:19.140> for<00:02:19.320> what<00:02:19.560> the

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
definitely set a basis for what the

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:21.860 
definitely set a basis for what the
scientific<00:02:20.459> field<00:02:20.820> is<00:02:21.030> really<00:02:21.239> like<00:02:21.570> this

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870 
scientific field is really like this

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.680 
scientific field is really like this
year<00:02:22.080> i'm<00:02:22.170> an<00:02:22.320> AP<00:02:22.470> biology<00:02:23.220> and<00:02:23.520> we<00:02:24.090> just<00:02:24.510> do

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
year i'm an AP biology and we just do

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:27.590 
year i'm an AP biology and we just do
these<00:02:24.840> amazing<00:02:25.080> labs<00:02:25.739> a<00:02:26.070> few<00:02:26.730> weeks<00:02:26.940> ago<00:02:27.120> we

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
these amazing labs a few weeks ago we

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.780 
these amazing labs a few weeks ago we
bred<00:02:28.080> fruit<00:02:28.380> flies<00:02:28.680> and<00:02:28.709> we<00:02:29.160> found<00:02:29.430> out<00:02:29.610> their

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
bred fruit flies and we found out their

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:33.020 
bred fruit flies and we found out their
genome<00:02:30.209> we<00:02:30.540> would<00:02:30.950> predict<00:02:31.950> a<00:02:32.070> genotypic<00:02:32.640> and

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:33.030 
genome we would predict a genotypic and

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:35.330 
genome we would predict a genotypic and
phenotypic<00:02:33.420> ratio<00:02:34.050> for<00:02:34.410> what<00:02:34.590> we<00:02:34.709> expected<00:02:35.220> to

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
phenotypic ratio for what we expected to

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.850 
phenotypic ratio for what we expected to
see<00:02:35.580> off<00:02:35.760> the<00:02:35.910> offspring<00:02:36.420> and<00:02:36.660> we<00:02:37.530> would<00:02:37.680> count

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
see off the offspring and we would count

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:39.830 
see off the offspring and we would count
the<00:02:38.220> number<00:02:38.730> that<00:02:38.850> we<00:02:38.970> actually<00:02:39.120> got<00:02:39.540> and

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
the number that we actually got and

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.600 
the number that we actually got and
solve<00:02:40.110> those<00:02:40.290> matched<00:02:40.590> our<00:02:40.830> predictions<00:02:41.370> to

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:41.610 
solve those matched our predictions to

solve those matched our predictions to
figure<00:02:41.880> out<00:02:42.000> what<00:02:42.360> type<00:02:42.540> of<00:02:42.570> genome<00:02:43.050> does<00:02:43.350> this

why<00:02:43.800> have<00:02:44.070> i'd<00:02:44.400> heard<00:02:44.670> about<00:02:44.940> that<00:02:45.150> happening

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:45.630 
why have i'd heard about that happening

00:02:45.630 --> 00:02:47.060 
why have i'd heard about that happening
but<00:02:45.810> never<00:02:46.019> thought<00:02:46.320> that<00:02:46.590> I<00:02:46.620> would<00:02:46.920> be

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 
but never thought that I would be

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:49.039 
but never thought that I would be
getting<00:02:47.640> to<00:02:47.910> do<00:02:48.060> that<00:02:48.090> in<00:02:48.420> high<00:02:48.660> school<00:02:48.690> you

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:49.049 
getting to do that in high school you

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:53.390 
getting to do that in high school you
know<00:02:49.230> I<00:02:51.500> think<00:02:52.500> one<00:02:52.769> of<00:02:52.799> the<00:02:52.950> things<00:02:53.190> that

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:53.400 
know I think one of the things that

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.699 
know I think one of the things that
struck<00:02:53.910> me<00:02:54.090> when<00:02:54.209> I<00:02:54.269> first<00:02:54.510> came<00:02:54.660> here<00:02:54.840> over<00:02:55.440> 20

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
struck me when I first came here over 20

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:58.460 
struck me when I first came here over 20
years<00:02:56.040> ago<00:02:56.510> was<00:02:57.510> just<00:02:57.840> the<00:02:57.959> sense<00:02:58.230> of

00:02:58.460 --> 00:02:58.470 
years ago was just the sense of

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:00.440 
years ago was just the sense of
intellectual<00:02:59.010> curiosity<00:02:59.370> that<00:03:00.000> a<00:03:00.030> lot<00:03:00.239> of<00:03:00.269> the

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
intellectual curiosity that a lot of the

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
kids have it was cool at while in high

school I came across a lot of different

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.020 
school I came across a lot of different
things<00:03:10.829> that<00:03:10.890> were<00:03:11.070> kind<00:03:11.310> of<00:03:11.400> interesting<00:03:11.880> and

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:12.030 
things that were kind of interesting and

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:16.460 
things that were kind of interesting and
among<00:03:12.269> that<00:03:12.299> stuff<00:03:12.720> was<00:03:12.959> a<00:03:13.730> briefcase<00:03:15.290> full<00:03:16.290> of

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:19.950 
probably 15 or so years ago and it

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:22.130 
probably 15 or so years ago and it
