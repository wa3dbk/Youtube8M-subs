00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
grippy feels because of these ribs that

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:10.730 
grippy feels because of these ribs that
they<00:01:08.700> put<00:01:08.909> in<00:01:09.030> the<00:01:09.119> plastic<00:01:09.380> there<00:01:10.380> on<00:01:10.590> the

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
texture to hold on to yet it seems like

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:19.969

not<00:01:20.189> dropped<00:01:20.580> it<00:01:20.880> in<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.030> case<00:01:21.330> yet<00:01:21.630> so<00:01:21.900> I

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
not dropped it in the case yet so I

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.990 
not dropped it in the case yet so I
don't<00:01:22.110> know<00:01:22.380> how<00:01:22.890> well<00:01:23.159> it<00:01:23.310> actually<00:01:23.490> does

another potential issue with the case
like<00:02:02.130> this<00:02:02.340> is<00:02:02.610> that<00:02:02.640> it<00:02:02.880> doesn't<00:02:03.240> provide<00:02:03.540> the

case or maybe an otterbox would provide

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.210 
case or maybe an otterbox would provide
but<00:02:09.539> it's<00:02:09.840> a<00:02:09.929> different<00:02:10.259> type<00:02:10.379> of<00:02:10.440> case<00:02:10.830> it's<00:02:11.129> a

00:02:11.210 --> 00:02:11.220 
but it's a different type of case it's a

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.050 
but it's a different type of case it's a
very<00:02:11.430> like<00:02:12.000> I<00:02:12.030> said<00:02:12.300> slim<00:02:12.660> K

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.060 
very like I said slim K

very like I said slim K
lower<00:02:13.750> profile<00:02:14.290> I<00:02:14.530> don't<00:02:14.980> like<00:02:15.010> the<00:02:15.250> bulkiness

with<00:02:19.390> this<00:02:19.569> type<00:02:19.780> of<00:02:19.810> case<00:02:20.200> but<00:02:20.980> I<00:02:21.010> think<00:02:21.459> for

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:21.760 
with this type of case but I think for

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.910 
with this type of case but I think for
the<00:02:22.030> price<00:02:22.060> it's<00:02:22.720> an<00:02:22.840> excellent<00:02:23.319> case<00:02:23.530> and

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 
the price it's an excellent case and

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.850 
the price it's an excellent case and
probably<00:02:24.730> cannot<00:02:25.090> be<00:02:25.300> beaten<00:02:25.540> I've<00:02:26.319> liked<00:02:26.650> it

probably cannot be beaten I've liked it
