00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.830 

and<00:03:09.400> i'm<00:03:09.610> going<00:03:09.730> to<00:03:09.790> using<00:03:10.120> my<00:03:10.240> dotting<00:03:10.480> tool

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
and i'm going to using my dotting tool

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.340 
and i'm going to using my dotting tool
again<00:03:11.250> and<00:03:12.480> this<00:03:13.480> is<00:03:13.660> the<00:03:13.780> size<00:03:13.990> that<00:03:14.230> i'm

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:14.350 
again and this is the size that i'm

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:15.720 
again and this is the size that i'm
using<00:03:14.770> this<00:03:14.860> a<00:03:14.920> little<00:03:15.130> bigger<00:03:15.340> than<00:03:15.490> the<00:03:15.580> one

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:15.730 
using this a little bigger than the one

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:24.530 
using this a little bigger than the one
on<00:03:15.850> your<00:03:15.970> shoes<00:03:16.620> but<00:03:17.620> it's<00:03:17.770> still<00:03:17.920> small<00:03:18.100> and

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:24.540 

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:27.390 

the<00:03:25.540> last<00:03:25.750> thing<00:03:26.020> would<00:03:26.380> be<00:03:26.530> to<00:03:26.709> apply<00:03:26.920> your

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:27.400 
the last thing would be to apply your

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:59.410 
the last thing would be to apply your
top<00:03:27.430> coat

00:03:59.410 --> 00:03:59.420 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:01.600 

so<00:04:00.080> that<00:04:00.380> is<00:04:00.530> basically<00:04:00.560> it<00:04:01.160> for<00:04:01.190> the<00:04:01.459> nail

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:01.610 
so that is basically it for the nail

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:03.490
