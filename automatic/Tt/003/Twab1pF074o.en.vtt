00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.480
 hello yourself dachshund mod reviews on 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:05.930
 gta sanandres going on this already 

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:08.519
 second series of reviews on mods today mod 

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:11.460
 describe which particular meaning is not species 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:14.040
 min do not need more precisely this mod adds 

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.750
 the map of and the legendary already and the beaten 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.090
 sales records gta 5 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:21.660
 He adds that very same 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:24.420
 square and already had time to enjoy 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:26.310
 many people there that I like 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.080
 minimalism in fact in general 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:32.070
 talk a lot about this map I will not 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:33.989
 he added the radar had this very map 

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:35.520
 as you can see it is made in more 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:39.600
 minimalistic style like 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:41.280
 actually and in gta 5 gta 4 it has already gone 

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.989
 It also replaces them with icons. 

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.200
 there was no icon for the banks I do right away 

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:48.000
 on the sampa this review but still we play 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.800
 he basically already they gta sanandres 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.289
 but sometimes sanderson naturally work 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.180
 Well, that's what it adds replaces 

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:55.829
 icons standard replaces card with 1 rd 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.539
 Noah for me here this drop now on 

00:00:55.829 --> 00:00:59.850
 he doesn't know how to explain it 

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:02.640
 triangle that this arrow do not know 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.769
 how to explain it in essence how she is not 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.880
 amenable to all this explanation this 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:10.520
 just a map and and hop and somewhere from gta 5 and 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:13.350
 installing it is also very simple all 

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:17.549
 download link to this mod will be in 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:20.250
 description can also find out while money 

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:22.740
 here and so in this way map 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.360
 is in beta development then 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.140
 there is she absolutely not finished yet 

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.760
 a bit 

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.310
 In general, to help and work yet they are not 

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:33.659
 did this circle that is like five 

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:36.640
 groups we have armed only 

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:39.130
 select a list of weapons that is in gta 4 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:41.200
 already by the way implemented and porting from 

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:43.600
 these here all killed again in these chips 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:45.970
 and will go at full speed as I feel 

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.110
 and the first one is the same radar 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.240
 which the 

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.190
 however it fits very well and 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.810
 I quite like it and how are you 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:57.000
 see he looks so nice and here these 

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:59.530
 badges look good too 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.360
 this is probably all really talk about 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:04.240
 this fashion does not make sense as I said 

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:07.000
 previously download links as always 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.280
 will be in the description to keep up and put 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.929
 because many try to find one 

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.739
 the very mod and it already is 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:13.739
 he has already been made
