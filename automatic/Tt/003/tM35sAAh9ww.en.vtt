00:00:01.070 --> 00:00:05.460
 Hi guys, how are you? I'm fine. Here I am. 

00:00:03.929 --> 00:00:08.280
 today to show my cooking pot 

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:14.880
 microwave pressure 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:21.000
 she has these safety valves open 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:24.570
 that way she has this eraser 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.750
 equal to the same common pressure cooker and 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:31.560
 to make the steamed vegetables 

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:34.410
 we get that red cap it 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:37.649
 here is another space that has to 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:42.030
 put the food we can get 

00:00:37.649 --> 00:00:48.180
 divide because you have these two pieces and 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:51.570
 also giving a will come back but i go 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:54.469
 able to fit with the brand as the 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.469
 lack of practice 

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:08.740
 I'll make it 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:11.980
 already ready 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:14.050
 then I got to share food 

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:17.850
 there you can make more than 1 

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:22.090
 at once this part is what we do 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:24.820
 the food directly into the pan and this 

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:29.670
 The other one puts the vegetables on top. 

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:29.670
 to be able to do the rejected pon 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:39.510
 then I'm putting water has to 

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:45.000
 put that mark on the water 

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:45.000
 putting warm water 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:53.520
 I put this part and I 'll put it now 

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:56.710
 I'll make broccoli 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:59.880
 I washed this block and left a bit of 

00:01:56.710 --> 00:01:59.880
 Sauce in this water with vinegar 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:05.100
 now I'll put all of it in this tray 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:21.520
 You can put the edicts together but I 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:21.520
 I wanted to make 1st broccoli 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.459
 and then I'll make the carrot 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.960
 now just cover the pan 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:49.940
 and set for five minutes in the 

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:49.940
 microwave 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:56.880
 I took the lid to make the steam 

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:58.650
 When are we going to cook another? 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:02.550
 meat food we leave any 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:12.540
 there's another place to put it is easy 

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:15.560
 It is because it has to have knack and now 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:15.560
 It's going for five minutes. 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:22.650
 ready 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:27.030

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:29.910

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:31.680

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:35.430
 was functioning as a pre-registration 

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:38.160
 even investing all steam 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:46.410
 I'm sure it's all the pressure 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:51.260
 It reopens and everything is cooked super 

00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:51.260

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:17.390
