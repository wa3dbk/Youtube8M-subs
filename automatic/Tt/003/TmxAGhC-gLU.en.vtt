00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
intervention then there will be that's

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:51.490 
intervention then there will be that's
the<00:00:41.370> argument<00:00:41.760> of<00:00:41.850> time<00:00:42.030> to<00:00:42.149> support<00:00:42.480> it

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:51.500 

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:58.900 

you'll<00:00:52.500> need<00:00:52.620> it<00:00:55.940> it's<00:00:56.940> fallen<00:00:57.300> off<00:00:57.890> a

00:00:58.900 --> 00:00:58.910 
you'll need it it's fallen off a

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:01.250 
you'll need it it's fallen off a
sentence<00:00:59.910> or<00:01:00.030> two<00:01:00.210> from<00:01:00.390> David<00:01:00.660> Hume<00:01:00.870> would

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
sentence or two from David Hume would

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.260 
sentence or two from David Hume would
correct<00:01:01.530> what<00:01:01.800> do<00:01:01.859> so<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.430> miracle<00:01:02.879> is

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.270 
correct what do so the miracle is

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.509

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
David Humes logic on this I think is

David Humes logic on this I think is
quite<00:01:33.180> irrefutable<00:01:33.659> he<00:01:33.930> says<00:01:34.170> what<00:01:34.860> is<00:01:35.070> more

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340 
quite irrefutable he says what is more

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.210 
quite irrefutable he says what is more
likely<00:01:35.369> that<00:01:36.030> the<00:01:36.810> laws<00:01:37.110> of<00:01:37.470> nature<00:01:37.560> have<00:01:38.189> been

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
likely that the laws of nature have been

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.490 
likely that the laws of nature have been
suspended<00:01:38.729> in<00:01:39.030> your<00:01:39.299> favor<00:01:39.689> and<00:01:39.990> in<00:01:40.229> a<00:01:40.320> way

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
mistake and in each case you must

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.899 
mistake and in each case you must
especially<00:01:46.530> if<00:01:46.860> you<00:01:46.979> didn't<00:01:47.250> see<00:01:47.430> it<00:01:47.520> yourself

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:47.909 
especially if you didn't see it yourself

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.940 
especially if you didn't see it yourself
and<00:01:48.119> you're<00:01:48.540> hearing<00:01:48.899> it<00:01:49.110> from<00:01:49.140> someone<00:01:49.740> who

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
and you're hearing it from someone who

and you're hearing it from someone who
says<00:01:50.220> that<00:01:51.119> they<00:01:51.360> did<00:01:51.689> I<00:01:51.930> would<00:01:52.200> go<00:01:52.320> further

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
says that they did I would go further

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.429 
says that they did I would go further
and<00:01:52.740> say<00:01:52.860> the<00:01:53.100> following<00:01:53.250> I'll<00:01:53.549> grant<00:01:53.939> you
