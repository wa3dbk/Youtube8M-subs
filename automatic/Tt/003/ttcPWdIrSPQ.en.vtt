00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.120
 hey here is christian again in this one 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.130
 video I want you a new one 

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:09.150
 novice smartphone imagine 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.830
 the lg is ready before the lte and how 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.139
 The name already says this 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.639
 entry-level smartphone an lte modem 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.619
 board means that you can with this 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.580
 Download device data very fast 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.170
 or 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.800
 of course also fast on the internet 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.210
 Surf currently costs this device 165 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.439
 euro is in german trade since 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.930
 available a few days 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.939
 I'll unpack the good piece and 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.320
 Of course, a look at the 

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:33.719
 Packing throw on the front 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.219
 clearly the product picture and the 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:38.700
 namely naming in the upper area 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:40.530
 lg spirit vorzelt de you turn the 

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.300
 packaging on the left side we have 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.640
 still the color version namely in black 

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.750
 but shared the I is a black 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.710
 model for the german market 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.600
 authorized 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.850
 on the back we still have one 

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.489
 small feature advertised namely still 

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:55.410
 good for that too dominates this 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.510
 device and on the right side of the housing 

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:00.539
 have the first technical notes 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:03.120
 namely to the display in a 4.7 inches 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:05.729
 diagonal slightly curved so not quite 

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.710
 as with the flex 2 we even have here 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.930
 a quad core on board we have an eight 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:12.330
 Megapixel main camera on the back 

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.979
 and we have the possibility of the device 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.509
 to operate over the back 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:18.090
 just like we did it from the high end 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:21.950
 lg's smartphones are familiar with the lg 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:25.350
 3 or the flex two 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:27.540
 packaging on and comes to light 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.340
 as usual the device that I put like 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.409
 always very short on the side of us 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.860
 take a look in the rest 

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:36.930
 packaging and there we have it again 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:38.610
 typically the quick start guide that 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.729
 means here the information gets like 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:43.470
 you set up the device in the beginning then 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:47.270
 we still have a modular power supply 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:51.090
 naturally consisting of mains plug and 

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:53.579
 data cable and charging cable that is with 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.950
 this cable I can not only the lg 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:57.479
 spirit forge lte load but i have 

00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.840
 also the possibility with this cable 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:03.390
 the data from the smartphone on the pc too 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.620
 transfer or in 

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:07.950
 reverse 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:10.100
 in consequence then we have the battery 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:13.650
 this and that is a in this case 

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:15.990
 2100 mAh strong battery is 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.730
 quite good for a beginner machine 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:19.890
 we have to look how long that 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:22.200
 device comes over the day I guess 

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:22.920
 a working day should definitely be 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.960
 be inside 

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:28.680
 and then we have a few more here 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:30.570
 of course this headphone from the 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.250
 lower price category that is we 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:34.620
 that do not have high-quality headphones 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.210
 but only so completely normal 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.760
 If you are already something better 

00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:42.090
 should own headphones at home then 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:45.060
 take this softens them out because 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:45.530
 These seem a little worse 

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:48.570
 his 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:52.080
 let's take care of that and come up 

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:53.850
 the front of this device and here 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:55.260
 we have another slide again 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:57.750
 the technical notes 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:59.310
 this symbol then stands for her then 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.810
 we have the quad core processor with us 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.510
 1.2 gigahertz 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.070
 that is a 410 snapdragon could very 

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:07.590
 very many entry-level devices for 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:10.770
 also with the motogp we have one 

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:14.730
 gigabyte ram 8gb internal memory of 

00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:17.520
 again via micro sd card at 32 

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:19.320
 gb can expand then we have 1 4 7 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:21.870
 inch display that is the diagonal 

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:23.970
 is 4.7 inches and we have one 

00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:27.030
 resolution in high definition means 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:31.110
 if I stickers that once made from 

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:32.430
 have 12 80 x 720 pixels 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:34.470
 accordingly, that's for one 

00:03:32.430 --> 00:03:37.140
 Entry-level equipment is in order 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:39.630
 also absolutely sufficient and it acts 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:42.989
 this is an ips-panel that means the 

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:47.070
 white values ​​are likely ips typical relative 

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:48.630
 be good that means 12 80 x 720 pixels 

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:50.459
 then have in the upper area yet 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:52.650
 various sensors such as proximity sensor 

00:03:50.459 --> 00:03:54.540
 brightness sensor logically the 

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.790
 earpiece for calling and a 

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:59.340
 front camera here in this case with 1 

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:01.019
 Megapixel resolution if we do the whole thing 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.600
 turn around, you see these too 

00:04:01.019 --> 00:04:06.540
 color variant posters called the whole 

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:10.320
 year black it is more of an anthracite 

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:12.330
 so a dark anthracite gray below 

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:15.790
 left with the speaker lg logo 

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:18.049
 and that of the lg g 3 

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:19.610
 back-to-back that is that 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:22.010
 the volume rocker with volume 

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:24.320
 down volume of the high and low 

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:26.240
 switch off so the power button is an 8 

00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:28.310
 megapixel camera that's really very 

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:30.110
 good for a smartphone and 

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:33.560
 logically then the 

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:34.910
 notified led in the upper 

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:36.770
 area we still have the audio 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:39.920
 connection for the headphones another 

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:42.440
 microphone and typically in the foot of the 

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:46.190
 device the micro usb connection and the 

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:48.290
 microphone for calling the battery has 

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:50.530
 he already saw the lies outside 

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:52.940
 that means i need this back 

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:54.860
 Remove is made of plastic better 

00:04:52.940 --> 00:04:58.820
 said polycarbonate that is 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:05:00.950
 whole is relatively flexible and if I am 

00:04:58.820 --> 00:05:03.980
 the back I have taken off 

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:07.310
 logically also insert the battery 

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:09.350
 with these pins congruent in the device 

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:12.170
 positioned and here you see also 

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:15.020
 times the amper milli pay 

00:05:12.170 --> 00:05:16.820
 namely 2100 milliamp hours and me 

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:19.550
 have the possibility of these slots 

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:22.280
 have both the micro sim card as 

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:25.669
 also insert the micro sd card and 

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:28.600
 to put the device into operation 

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:30.830
 I make the packaging again 

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:32.720
 the device starts over this power 

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:35.570
 Button on the back of the vibrates 

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:37.790
 very short a very pleasant feeling and 

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:39.200
 The device is powered up by android 

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:41.210
 Of course, here comes to use 

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:43.910
 and as I said at the beginning with 

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:46.700
 a slight curved display and that 

00:05:43.910 --> 00:05:48.260
 you see here the housing is 

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:52.510
 slightly curved and like me 

00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:55.700
 can remember the slides so mwc 

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:57.440
 2015 in Barcelona I was told that 

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:59.530
 actually only this housing light 

00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:03.680
 craft is the display inside 

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:06.280
 However, it is not exactly what it is 

00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:08.570
 this curved shape has like the lg 

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:11.480
 reflex two at first impression 

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:14.330
 makes a really good figure 

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:16.280
 Good in hand with 47 inches of these devices 

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:17.950
 you get more rare than that 

00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:19.840
 Most manufacturers put in their 

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:21.400
 middle class upper class 

00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:24.580
 high end smartphones tend to be bigger 

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:26.800
 Models of 47 inches really 

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:29.650
 very nice compact and also the 

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:32.560
 Processing is really good here 

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:35.320
 absolutely nothing stiff connection and also 

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:37.240
 the backside can be at any corners 

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:39.940
 push in so you can get up here already 

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:42.669
 the first look can say ok 465 euro 

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:45.580
 you get here from lg in the form of 

00:06:42.669 --> 00:06:47.560
 spirit of lte really a good package 

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:50.590
 delivered you see the device drives 

00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:53.770
 straight up and so slowly stops the 

00:06:50.590 --> 00:06:55.720
 booting and so I say goodbye 

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:58.060
 me also from this video with 

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:59.800
 the unboxing and a first impression 

00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:01.360
 about the materials processing 

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:05.410
 the haptics and the valence with 

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:06.669
 the lg rtl de thank you that you 

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:08.169
 of course I would be back 

00:07:06.669 --> 00:07:10.180
 Huge if you like the channel 

00:07:08.169 --> 00:07:12.580
 Oppose and leave a comment below 

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:15.630
 leave the video until then 

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:15.630
 it's good and ciao
