00:01:27.679 --> 00:01:27.689 
with arm pump regularly is that they are

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.780 
with arm pump regularly is that they are
gripping<00:01:27.960> so<00:01:28.320> tight<00:01:28.619> when<00:01:29.130> riding<00:01:29.369> perhaps

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:29.790

critical and avoiding arm pump
especially<00:01:46.439> the<00:01:46.560> fork<00:01:46.829> try<00:01:47.790> and<00:01:47.970> get<00:01:48.119> that

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
especially the fork try and get that

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:49.910 
especially the fork try and get that
right<00:01:48.600> air<00:01:48.840> pressure<00:01:49.200> in<00:01:49.409> there<00:01:49.619> so<00:01:49.770> you're

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
right air pressure in there so you're

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:51.889 
right air pressure in there so you're
using<00:01:50.340> all<00:01:50.460> the<00:01:50.549> travel<00:01:51.030> but<00:01:51.240> not<00:01:51.390> bombing<00:01:51.780> out

too<00:01:52.079> much<00:01:52.350> too<00:01:53.220> hard<00:01:53.549> you're<00:01:53.909> going<00:01:54.030> to<00:01:54.090> get<00:01:54.240> a

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
too much too hard you're going to get a

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.389 
too much too hard you're going to get a

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
lot of force and pressure through your

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.899 
front the bite will be dropped in really
low<00:02:01.409> and<00:02:01.680> that's<00:02:02.070> going<00:02:02.250> to<00:02:02.340> put<00:02:02.520> more<00:02:02.729> weight

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:02.909 
low and that's going to put more weight

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:05.300 
low and that's going to put more weight
onto<00:02:03.299> the<00:02:03.390> handlebar<00:02:03.899> so<00:02:04.200> look<00:02:04.920> at<00:02:05.040> getting

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:05.310 
onto the handlebar so look at getting

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.700 
onto the handlebar so look at getting
that<00:02:05.460> preload<00:02:06.030> as<00:02:06.299> accurate<00:02:06.750> as<00:02:06.840> possible<00:02:06.869> so

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
that preload as accurate as possible so

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:10.760 
that preload as accurate as possible so

your bar slightly higher to bring that
weight<00:02:42.600> further<00:02:42.959> back<00:02:43.230> obviously<00:02:43.670> your<00:02:44.670> leg

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
weight further back obviously your leg

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
your arms so relying on them is way more

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:50.960 
your arms so relying on them is way more
efficient<00:02:49.530> way<00:02:49.650> to<00:02:49.680> ride<00:02:50.040> especially<00:02:50.520> when

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:50.970 
efficient way to ride especially when

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.690 
efficient way to ride especially when
you're<00:02:51.120> tackling<00:02:51.360> long<00:02:51.780> descents<00:02:52.700> consider

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
you're tackling long descents consider

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:55.340 
you're tackling long descents consider
getting<00:02:53.910> out<00:02:54.150> the<00:02:54.300> main<00:02:54.510> line<00:02:54.750> on<00:02:54.959> the<00:02:55.050> edges

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
getting out the main line on the edges

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.110 
getting out the main line on the edges
of<00:02:55.410> the<00:02:55.530> trail<00:02:55.800> they'll<00:02:56.370> be<00:02:56.489> smoother<00:02:56.910> lines

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:57.120 
of the trail they'll be smoother lines

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.940 
of the trail they'll be smoother lines
and<00:02:57.420> therefore<00:02:57.720> less<00:02:58.110> fatigue<00:02:58.410> in<00:02:58.560> your<00:02:58.680> arms

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
and therefore less fatigue in your arms

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.100 
and therefore less fatigue in your arms
definitely<00:02:59.820> use<00:03:00.000> the<00:03:00.209> whole<00:03:00.360> trail<00:03:00.720> makes<00:03:00.989> a

definitely use the whole trail makes a

definitely use the whole trail makes a

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:06.989 
a corner but it's that much smoother

you're<00:03:07.590> going<00:03:07.709> to<00:03:07.769> be<00:03:07.830> able<00:03:07.920> to<00:03:08.040> break<00:03:08.459> later

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
you're going to be able to break later

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:11.810 
you're going to be able to break later
grit<00:03:09.540> more<00:03:09.840> and<00:03:10.140> feel<00:03:10.860> less<00:03:11.190> fatigue<00:03:11.519> from<00:03:11.700> the

those things either you get it or you

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:29.509

help<00:03:31.560> a<00:03:31.709> little<00:03:31.860> bit<00:03:32.160> but<00:03:32.640> I<00:03:32.670> think<00:03:32.850> the

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:32.940 
help a little bit but I think the

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.940 
help a little bit but I think the
biggest<00:03:33.180> cure<00:03:33.600> is<00:03:34.110> probably<00:03:34.470> just<00:03:34.590> riding

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:34.950 
biggest cure is probably just riding

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:36.410 
biggest cure is probably just riding
your<00:03:35.040> bike<00:03:35.190> as<00:03:35.370> much<00:03:35.579> as<00:03:35.730> you<00:03:35.790> can<00:03:36.000> ride

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:36.420 
your bike as much as you can ride

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:37.670 
your bike as much as you can ride
through<00:03:36.660> it<00:03:36.870> and<00:03:37.019> then<00:03:37.440> you'll<00:03:37.560> become

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:37.680 
through it and then you'll become

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.770 
through it and then you'll become
stronger<00:03:38.190> more<00:03:38.489> relaxed<00:03:39.150> on<00:03:39.239> the<00:03:39.269> bike<00:03:39.510> and

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:39.780 
stronger more relaxed on the bike and

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:41.870 
stronger more relaxed on the bike and
therefore<00:03:40.230> no<00:03:40.440> arm<00:03:40.650> pump<00:03:40.890> but<00:03:41.579> it's

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
therefore no arm pump but it's

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.640 
therefore no arm pump but it's
definitely<00:03:42.060> a<00:03:42.299> good<00:03:42.420> excuse<00:03:42.900> so<00:03:43.049> why<00:03:43.410> not
