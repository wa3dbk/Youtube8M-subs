one it doesn't have a kickstand and that

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.490 
one it doesn't have a kickstand and that
was<00:02:45.019> probably<00:02:45.200> to<00:02:45.440> conserve<00:02:45.860> its<00:02:46.130> thinness

00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:47.500 
was probably to conserve its thinness

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.630 
was probably to conserve its thinness
but<00:02:48.500> a<00:02:48.530> kickstand<00:02:49.040> would<00:02:49.250> have<00:02:49.340> been<00:02:49.430> nice

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:49.640
