00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.880 

I<00:00:00.060> think<00:00:00.539> we're<00:00:00.780> going<00:00:00.930> to<00:00:00.989> try<00:00:01.140> carving<00:00:01.469> the

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:01.890 
I think we're going to try carving the

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:05.930 
I think we're going to try carving the
elongated<00:00:03.650> triangle<00:00:04.650> that<00:00:05.160> goes<00:00:05.370> along<00:00:05.549> the

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
elongated triangle that goes along the

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.030 
elongated triangle that goes along the
arch<00:00:06.120> going<00:00:07.049> to<00:00:07.170> just<00:00:07.350> define<00:00:07.620> these

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040 
arch going to just define these

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:12.470 
arch going to just define these
triangles<00:00:10.130> these<00:00:11.130> curved<00:00:11.400> lines<00:00:11.639> I<00:00:11.940> have<00:00:12.450> a

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
triangles these curved lines I have a

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.959 
triangles these curved lines I have a
guide<00:00:12.780> in<00:00:13.080> pencil<00:00:13.830> but<00:00:14.549> they're<00:00:14.670> kind<00:00:14.880> of

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
guide in pencil but they're kind of

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:18.400 
guide in pencil but they're kind of
freehand<00:00:15.420> it<00:00:15.740> always<00:00:16.740> going<00:00:16.920> with<00:00:17.190> the<00:00:17.340> green

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:18.410 
freehand it always going with the green

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:22.189 
freehand it always going with the green
so<00:00:19.410> it<00:00:19.439> doesn't<00:00:19.800> split<00:00:20.570> if<00:00:21.570> I<00:00:21.660> carved<00:00:22.020> in<00:00:22.109> the

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
so it doesn't split if I carved in the

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:23.779 
so it doesn't split if I carved in the
opposite<00:00:22.560> direction<00:00:22.680> the<00:00:23.519> grain<00:00:23.760> would

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
opposite direction the grain would

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:34.960 
opposite direction the grain would
actually<00:00:24.420> pull<00:00:25.019> the<00:00:25.199> knife<00:00:25.350> away<00:00:26.130> from<00:00:26.519> me

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:34.970 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:37.600 

I'm<00:00:35.510> going<00:00:35.660> to<00:00:35.750> remove<00:00:36.050> the<00:00:36.260> wood<00:00:36.490> facing<00:00:37.490> the

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:37.610 
I'm going to remove the wood facing the

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:43.840 
I'm going to remove the wood facing the
cut<00:00:37.790> I<00:00:37.940> just<00:00:38.120> made<00:00:38.360> I<00:00:42.040> always<00:00:43.040> easily<00:00:43.400> use<00:00:43.640> my

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:43.850 
cut I just made I always easily use my

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:46.030 
cut I just made I always easily use my
thumb<00:00:44.180> or<00:00:44.600> my<00:00:44.720> finger<00:00:45.080> to<00:00:45.680> give<00:00:45.830> some

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:46.040 
thumb or my finger to give some

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.760 
thumb or my finger to give some
resistance<00:00:46.610> so<00:00:47.120> if<00:00:47.270> the<00:00:47.420> blade<00:00:47.690> popped<00:00:48.410> free

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:48.770 
resistance so if the blade popped free

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:50.740 
resistance so if the blade popped free
it<00:00:49.040> wouldn't<00:00:49.370> skitter<00:00:49.730> across<00:00:50.060> the<00:00:50.180> wood<00:00:50.540> and

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:50.750 
it wouldn't skitter across the wood and

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:52.780 
it wouldn't skitter across the wood and
damage<00:00:51.260> the<00:00:51.290> surface<00:00:51.620> other<00:00:52.340> parts<00:00:52.610> that<00:00:52.760> I

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:52.790 
damage the surface other parts that I

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:56.200 
damage the surface other parts that I
want<00:00:53.030> to<00:00:53.090> leave<00:00:53.240> untouched<00:00:54.580> see<00:00:55.580> I<00:00:55.610> often<00:00:55.880> use

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:56.210 
want to leave untouched see I often use

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.410 
want to leave untouched see I often use
a<00:00:56.240> finger<00:00:56.540> to<00:00:56.660> guide<00:00:58.150> especially<00:00:59.150> when<00:00:59.300> I'm

00:00:59.410 --> 00:00:59.420 
a finger to guide especially when I'm

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.150 
a finger to guide especially when I'm
going<00:00:59.690> under<00:00:59.870> pressure<00:01:00.140> then<00:01:00.830> the<00:01:00.980> knife

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:01.160 
going under pressure then the knife

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.850 
going under pressure then the knife
could<00:01:01.370> slip<00:01:01.760> and<00:01:01.989> that<00:01:02.989> could<00:01:03.170> be<00:01:03.200> disastrous

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:03.860 
could slip and that could be disastrous

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:09.580 
could slip and that could be disastrous
