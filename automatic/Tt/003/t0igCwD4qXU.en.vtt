00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.340
 hello guys and girls welcome to my 

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:06.380
 spain in today's video I'll bring you 

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:08.300
 the tutorial of how to make a fan 

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:10.570
 hand a fan a hand would look so 

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:10.570
 A) Yes 

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.219
 to do it we need approximately 

00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:17.930
 a quarter of the deck and I recommend 

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:19.490
 sincerely that the letters are as 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:21.680
 new possible if you take some letters 

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:25.370
 old will not go well 

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:28.250
 then we need a grip that is finger 

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:30.030
 finger index finger and up middle finger 

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.010
 and ring finger 

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:34.310
 this has to be our grip and now 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:37.070
 we turn out the thumb is worth 

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:38.870
 this is the rust 

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.820
 when you have this grip, the only thing 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:42.130
 what to do is a movement that consists 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.260
 in swiping the thumb up 

00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:46.089
 quickly 

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.460
 how to do this, it is not very difficult 

00:00:46.089 --> 00:00:50.840
 the truth 

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.840
 the only thing you have to do is 

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:58.019
 when you have the beat, lower the index 

00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:58.019
 here 

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:03.070
 with the whole thumb not only with the tip 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.890
 that happened to them at the beginning and it's like that and 

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:07.330
 we will get many letters with all the 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.430
 thumb and with everything I mean even 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:12.280
 until this part of the hand 

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:14.020
 slide up quickly 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.450
 letters first practice this and you 

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.250
 the truth will come out very short because you have 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.050
 what to do is lower your finger and bread and not 

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.220
 whole will only thing is you have to 

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:24.310
 to make it come out whole because very 

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:27.460
 simple by lowering this finger you 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:30.430
 you push with your big toe up 

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.540
 point and apart with these fingers towards 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:34.210
 down 

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:36.250
 pum and so many more letters come out 

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:38.229
 you have the rhythm 

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:39.640
 you lower this finger with the thumb tip 

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:40.990
 we push up but the time we 

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.400
 You have pushed 

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.820
 with these fingers down then 

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:47.920
 from below it would look like that's how it is 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:50.530
 you lower your finger stretches jce that part 

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:51.850
 stretch with these fingers you take some 

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.350
 how many cards but this is a camera 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:56.350
 slow has to be very fast so that 

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:58.350
 Okay, here you lower your finger 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:01.320
 is that doing a little in plan 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:04.710
 and now with the thumb up with 

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:07.409
 all the thumb you have seen all the 

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:09.119
 thumb and with the others less 

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.229
 you get out now it's left unclear because what 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:12.349
 I'm doing it then you have to 

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:14.580
 do as a sliding motion 

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:16.080
 that you could now finger up 

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.519
 down at the same time and so at the beginning 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.580
 It can be quite complicated because 

00:02:17.519 --> 00:02:21.900
 it cost me I do not know how a week until 

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:23.250
 that I got it done well because 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.890
 will start out stockings or jump to 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.180
 chunks nothing happens the only thing that 

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:28.769
 I recommend that you practice and practice 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:30.750
 with the deck as new as possible and with 

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:32.780
 a quarter of the deck because if you 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.960
 You are not going to come out of cards either 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:37.790
 a last review of Sofia 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:39.860
 you take this crime 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.209
 pagÃ©s this finger here with the thumb 

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:44.239
 push is all the cards that you can 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:47.480
 up and with these you go down and 

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:49.310
 by doing this quickly it would be to these 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.469
 three do not have to go down in plan one to 

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:54.019
 one has to lose all at once that 

00:02:51.469 --> 00:02:56.209
 we are not the same height for this 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:57.730
 concerned against the fingers and so and 

00:02:56.209 --> 00:03:00.250
 I would leave 

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:02.409
 and you can do it by hand with everyone 

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:04.260
 use them as a trick to choose 

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:06.129
 letters to the viewer or whatever you want 

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:07.480
 good but that has been liked and that 

00:03:06.129 --> 00:03:08.769
 they have served practicing and 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.209
 practice as I always say to you because in 

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:13.090
 magic the most important thing is the 

00:03:10.209 --> 00:03:14.260
 practice to give like to comment more if 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.420
 have any questions or suggestions 

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:18.220
 what do you want me to upload 

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:21.660
 subscribe and nothing guys we see the 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:21.660
 next goodbye
