the seasons of Power Rangers that I

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.480 
the seasons of Power Rangers that I
didn't<00:01:30.720> watch<00:01:30.930> at<00:01:31.170> all<00:01:31.320> because<00:01:31.740> it<00:01:32.189> was<00:01:32.310> like

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
didn't watch at all because it was like

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.880 
didn't watch at all because it was like
after<00:01:33.000> just<00:01:34.250> he<00:01:35.250> had<00:01:35.400> acquired<00:01:35.759> the<00:01:36.060> rights

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:36.890 
after just he had acquired the rights

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.249 
after just he had acquired the rights
actually<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:38.070> last<00:01:38.310> one<00:01:38.820> I<00:01:39.090> fully<00:01:39.930> had

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
actually the last one I fully had

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:43.639 
actually the last one I fully had
watched<00:01:40.560> was<00:01:41.180> Dino<00:01:42.180> Thunder<00:01:42.509> just<00:01:43.380> so<00:01:43.590> you

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
watched was Dino Thunder just so you

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.520 
watched was Dino Thunder just so you
have<00:01:43.860> an<00:01:43.920> idea<00:01:44.340> of<00:01:44.430> what<00:01:44.759> was<00:01:45.720> the<00:01:45.840> last<00:01:45.990> one<00:01:46.320> I

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:46.530 
have an idea of what was the last one I

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.100 
have an idea of what was the last one I
knew<00:01:47.070> a<00:01:47.460> lot<00:01:47.909> about<00:01:47.970> and<00:01:49.040> they<00:01:50.040> got<00:01:50.220> to<00:01:50.369> use<00:01:50.549> the

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:51.110 
knew a lot about and they got to use the

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:56.749 
knew a lot about and they got to use the
mystic<00:01:52.110> force<00:01:52.439> dragon<00:01:53.100> Zord<00:01:53.939> and<00:01:55.310> we<00:01:56.310> find<00:01:56.579> out

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
mystic force dragon Zord and we find out

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.649 
mystic force dragon Zord and we find out
that<00:01:56.790> I<00:01:57.509> guess<00:01:58.290> they<00:01:58.530> can<00:01:58.710> use<00:01:58.979> their

00:01:59.649 --> 00:01:59.659 
that I guess they can use their

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:02.330 
that I guess they can use their
legendary<00:02:00.659> Ranger<00:02:01.229> keys<00:02:01.469> in<00:02:01.799> their<00:02:02.070> sabers

legendary Ranger keys in their sabers

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.450 
legendary Ranger keys in their sabers

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
and maybe in their blasters because of

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:10.010 
and maybe in their blasters because of
Noah<00:02:06.180> he<00:02:06.570> uses<00:02:06.930> all<00:02:07.140> their<00:02:07.439> sabers<00:02:07.740> any<00:02:09.020> head
