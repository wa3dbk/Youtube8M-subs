00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.740 
there one there and one there and then
the<00:01:32.970> way<00:01:33.180> it<00:01:33.479> makes<00:01:33.540> it<00:01:34.140> looks<00:01:34.380> like<00:01:34.619> so<00:01:34.890> it's<00:01:35.220> a

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:35.750 
the way it makes it looks like so it's a

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:41.410 
the way it makes it looks like so it's a
full<00:01:36.750> block<00:01:37.020> is<00:01:37.340> one<00:01:38.340> of<00:01:38.430> the<00:01:38.520> features<00:01:38.880> in<00:01:39.259> 1.3

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
full block is one of the features in 1.3

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:45.469 
full block is one of the features in 1.3
with<00:01:42.420> the<00:01:42.869> corner<00:01:43.200> stairs<00:01:44.090> so<00:01:45.090> now<00:01:45.210> it's<00:01:45.360> like

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479 
with the corner stairs so now it's like

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.630 
with the corner stairs so now it's like
full<00:01:45.720> block<00:01:45.930> you<00:01:46.140> just<00:01:46.290> have<00:01:46.409> that<00:01:46.439> shadow<00:01:46.890> how

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
full block you just have that shadow how

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.880 
full block you just have that shadow how
to<00:01:47.700> get<00:01:47.850> rid<00:01:48.000> of<00:01:48.030> that<00:01:48.180> shadow<00:01:48.560> to<00:01:49.560> take<00:01:49.710> out

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 
to get rid of that shadow to take out

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:54.350 
to get rid of that shadow to take out
these<00:01:50.280> four<00:01:50.579> blocks<00:01:51.020> past<00:01:52.020> lives<00:01:52.350> there<00:01:53.360> so

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
these four blocks past lives there so

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:59.200 
these four blocks past lives there so
that's<00:01:54.689> pretty<00:01:54.869> much<00:01:54.960> it<00:01:55.079> just<00:01:56.070> keep<00:01:56.329> putting

00:01:59.200 --> 00:01:59.210 
that's pretty much it just keep putting

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:01.280 
that's pretty much it just keep putting
stairs<00:02:00.210> like<00:02:00.420> that<00:02:00.600> to<00:02:00.719> make<00:02:00.810> them<00:02:00.960> corners

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
stairs like that to make them corners

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.139 
stairs like that to make them corners
bear<00:02:01.500> stare<00:02:01.979> so<00:02:02.189> you<00:02:02.280> go<00:02:02.399> on<00:02:02.520> top<00:02:02.729> of<00:02:02.880> this<00:02:02.969> one

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
bear stare so you go on top of this one

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:06.709 
bear stare so you go on top of this one
jump<00:02:04.049> up<00:02:04.229> on<00:02:04.439> top<00:02:04.590> of<00:02:04.649> this<00:02:04.799> one<00:02:04.979> jump<00:02:05.250> up<00:02:05.719> and
