00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:08.259
 at least 10,000 square kilometers to fall together 

00:00:08.259 --> 00:00:09.769
 such a huge one 

00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:12.859
 but once beautiful of that it is for 4000 square kilometers of it 

00:00:12.859 --> 00:00:14.669
 tidal flats 

00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:18.210
 and on that scale that size you see nowhere else in the world four thousand 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.419
 square kilometers in a row 

00:00:20.419 --> 00:00:22.220
 tidal flats 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:24.140
 we grabbed the audience 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.150
 every day it is different every day the plates are located where else the 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.020
 otherwise swallow a storm and that has changed again with just making 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:33.660
 the tides weigh in those days 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.360
 natural daily and affects but also storms that all that 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.950
 and there on and in it live wild animals, and those that are able to live there again 

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:43.700
 surroundings 

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.700
 that interplay 

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.420
 the landscape for minus as well as biology 

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:54.430
 on this scale an audition with zapped 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.900
 we are very here in the national park work 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:01.900
 schiermonnikoog 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.060
 on the edge of the Wadden Sea 

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:05.080
 the east 

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:06.370
 behind us 

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:08.460
 and yes, everything with it 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.260
 In such a time, so much dynamism that, for example, these plants 4 

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:15.580
 all can withstand salt water 

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:19.400
 and your geraniums at home can't do that but they do have the mechanisms 

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:23.180
 in sight because to separate the fresh water would use the fresh water 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:24.210
 so they also do that 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.090
 excrete them again 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.840
 and 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.979
 in addition, you just have a little the dynamics of the normal erp influence 

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:30.460
 So 

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:32.740
 socks plates that are completely dry 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.610
 and then the birds can eat and at other times the bike will come to europe 

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.160
 comedy records again under water and then the us comes back in and then has to 

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:43.980
 according to weather on the land say something yes about temporarily we have to 

00:01:43.979 --> 00:01:47.180
 That means they have to wait for the high water until the water returns 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.180
 drops and they have your table covered in the Wadden Sea 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:56.200
 all the dynamics of the turn and growth has ensured that 

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.550
 schiermonnikoog 

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:01.110
 has become four kilometers longer in the last fifty years 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.570
 in addition, a positive balance country is what we call that in professional terms 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:09.420
 means that more material is added to the island also afterwards 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.080
 talk the island just grows
