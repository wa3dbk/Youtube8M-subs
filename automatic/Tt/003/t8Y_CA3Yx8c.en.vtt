00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 hello that such friends talk to you enjoy the 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:06.839
 alternative future and how they can be 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.610
 account for the title of the video so it's 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.769
 I will tell you about a rumor that every time 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.139
 it takes more strength and it's about a 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.880
 supposed new saga of dragon ball z and 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.800
 is that after the movie the 

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.990
 battle of the gods was all a 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.510
 success in the Asian countries the past 

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.460
 March 30, 2013 it was said that the 

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.619
 own akira toriyama would have a new 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.539
 project or be a new saga of dragon 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:29.699
 ball chronologically after the 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.830
 battle against bills and so far 

00:00:29.699 --> 00:00:34.050
 Several images and information have come out 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.180
 new to light but still do not know if 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:38.340
 they are just rumors or inventions of fans or 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.440
 be the well-known fan hearts and about 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.510
 the new saga is said that after the 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.820
 he fights against bills he confesses to 

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.070
 goku that besides him there are 12 gods 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:49.079
 stronger than he good said this 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:50.760
 obviously we know that to be true the 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:53.250
 alleged new series of dragon ball 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.230
 will deal with how goku manages to win 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:57.360
 these new gods would also have 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.370
 new transformations and levels of 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:02.460
 Indian super saiyans for example the 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.830
 super sayayin god phase 23 etcetera but 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.450
 Well now I will show you the images of 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:08.549
 the supposed new saga 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.250
 and give them my opinion and clarify I'm not 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.020
 100% sure they are true for 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.929
 I will also comment on them so 

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:18.179
 let's start in this first image you see 

00:01:15.929 --> 00:01:20.130
 to bard like a sayayin god and we can 

00:01:18.179 --> 00:01:22.679
 see some information at the bottom of the photo 

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.780
 good for me this image is not true 

00:01:22.679 --> 00:01:26.490
 since it makes me a little absurd that 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.860
 Bardock reach this phase not 

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:30.689
 discredited its power as it is one of 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.549
 the sayayin is strongest of all the 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:34.649
 series but since he had one see special 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:36.929
 in the series I doubt that he has another 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:39.000
 appearance and less like super sayayin 

00:01:36.929 --> 00:01:40.799
 but God is not a bad idea in 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.659
 staff I would like there to be a 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.810
 encounter between goku and his father would be 

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:47.789
 epic in these images you can see to 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.220
 vegeta transformed into super saiyans 

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:51.899
 Indians and well I suppose that if true 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.270
 this saga obviously we can decipher 

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:56.640
 more transformations not only in goku 

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.039
 but also in bz and possibly in the 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:02.150
 others sayayin maybe these images do not 

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:04.280
 be real but they are well made 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:06.500
 then we can see our 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.330
 Friend bills with another character that has 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.670
 Sayayin look but in this picture 

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:12.890
 is supposed to be the second god of the 

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:15.710
 destruction and bills when you notice it you see a 

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.720
 little amazed in my opinion this image 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:21.110
 just as all is well made and has 

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:23.030
 meaning according to the good saga here 

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.130
 I leave you another image that I found 

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.050
 it is said that this is another goddess of 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:29.030
 the good destruction first of all 

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:31.040
 It would be exciting to see more women in 

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:33.050
 dragon ball and especially as a villain 

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.209
 but I think it would be a bit grotesque to see 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:37.370
 to our hero breaking from the mother to 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:39.230
 a woman and for the latter is why 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.360
 I doubt there are female warriors in 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:44.570
 the saga but it's not my word but the 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:46.850
 of akira itself in the latest images 

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:49.220
 that I could get you can see three 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:51.380
 supposed goddesses of destruction here 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:53.209
 we have the first one supposed to be 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:55.430
 a sayayin but here we can see a 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:57.380
 error has red hair and according to 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:59.330
 words of vegeta the saints have the 

00:02:57.380 --> 00:03:00.780
 black hair except they are 

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:02.610
 hybrids 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.500
 well here we can see some of the 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:06.600
 images that I liked the most and that you see 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.550
 more real good some also look 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.470
 real but anyway here you can see 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:13.569
 Goku and a goddess carrying out a 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:16.060
 what do you think? 

00:03:13.569 --> 00:03:18.280
 and finally I leave the last 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:20.530
 image here you can see bg is super 

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.780
 Indian saiyans in the background and mainly 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.790
 you can see a supposed goddess of the 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.650
 destruction and here as in others 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:28.329
 My only opinion is that the 

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.370
 I worked whether or not it was toriyama 

00:03:28.329 --> 00:03:32.560
 they were well made and you can see with 

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:34.209
 a technology very similar to what was 

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.219
 made the movie of the battle of the 

00:03:34.209 --> 00:03:38.590
 gods the last opinion have it 

00:03:36.219 --> 00:03:40.870
 you but taking advantage of this space 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:42.909
 I just want to mention one thing in case 

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.620
 that a new saga was made as soon as 

00:03:42.909 --> 00:03:46.569
 time will have to wait for it 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:49.269
 premiere in Latin America and other countries 

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:51.040
 in addition another question is the dubbing already 

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:53.139
 it was noted that it cost work that the 

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:55.329
 actors will accept the proposal and only 

00:03:53.139 --> 00:03:57.699
 for a movie what would happen if they arrived 

00:03:55.329 --> 00:03:59.799
 to reject the series I just want to tell you 

00:03:57.699 --> 00:04:01.780
 that it's time to accept some 

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:03.760
 new voices and that's not why I want to say 

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:05.650
 that I do not value our dubbing but 

00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:07.840
 we must accept the reality that 

00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:10.000
 the actors that commonly lend their 

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:12.010
 voice for these little-known characters 

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.260
 of age an example is the voice of the teacher 

00:04:12.010 --> 00:04:16.419
 roshi that unfortunately already died and 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:18.519
 There was a need to change it, I hope 

00:04:16.419 --> 00:04:20.650
 understand my message and well that's 

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:22.690
 all thanks for your time and comment 

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:25.090
 What did you think about the video? 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:27.870
 say share it with your friends and I 

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:27.870
 chao dismissal
