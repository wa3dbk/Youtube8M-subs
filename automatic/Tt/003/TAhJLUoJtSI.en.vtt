00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:13.690
 Hello everyone today I decided to finally 

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:15.460
 make a video about your brushes already 

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:18.340
 tried to do something to me not very 

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:20.200
 It turned out today I will try 

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:22.270
 I hope this time I will succeed 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:25.150
 no tongue 

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:28.419
 brushes will not fall out of focus and 

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:31.599
 I can still tell you to 

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:34.660
 besides me already a couple of people asked about 

00:00:31.599 --> 00:00:36.700
 this time the people are demanded over told 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:41.260
 to the more I want the same 

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:42.940
 I'll start sharing with my set 

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:45.880
 brushes for him it's my biggest 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:48.040
 the set that came with the bag principle and 

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:50.230
 brush bag i will show i will show all 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:53.020
 the rest of the brush but probably will 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:58.000
 several videos to make them shorter 

00:00:53.020 --> 00:01:01.660
 and strained special you do me 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.330
 the whole order began to be planned here because 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:06.490
 such brushes because I had 

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:09.220
 such Chinese they began to fall apart 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:12.250
 because their soap is wrong but 

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:14.679
 I 'll probably tell you about that too 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:17.920
 I have that, right here, this one 

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:19.630
 the nap began to fall off and I decided that 

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.649
 you have to finally buy something 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.469
 worthwhile 

00:01:20.649 --> 00:01:26.859
 something more quality to me more 

00:01:23.469 --> 00:01:28.479
 this did not happen and here somehow in 

00:01:26.859 --> 00:01:30.060
 One moment I decided what I needed 

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:33.909
 these brushes 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:36.100
 it is the largest set that I can 

00:01:33.909 --> 00:01:39.600
 say about these brushes cool yes 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:41.950
 very soft in general about these brushes already 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.020
 Protocol plan precisely brushes different 

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:47.649
 brands I think everyone knows everything and 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:51.670
 This is not an exception I can note that 

00:01:47.649 --> 00:01:54.069
 she is very cool here bent to 

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.840
 the minimum amount of water I got 

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:58.810
 I do n’t even know maybe she’s not there at all 

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:01.950
 rinse gets and i'm fine 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:05.770
 collected nothing staggering does not wobble 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:07.929
 Great pen very conveniently possible 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.069
 notice that they are not very long 

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:12.910
 compared to many others 

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:18.220
 professional brushes that is here on 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:22.120
 swing my palm good brush it 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:26.489
 number 100 4 and basically everything you need 

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:30.519
 she performs the following brush thawed straight 

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:32.739
 great rival I did probably 

00:02:30.519 --> 00:02:34.870
 I love even more this is my first 

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:36.000
 peak brush such a plan here this dua 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:39.569
 fiber 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:42.459
 I'm already thinking about everything I'm alone 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:45.970
 retarded person sample for the first time and 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:48.459
 I really like her because I don’t 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:51.040
 I know how other duo fiber but this spends 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:53.620
 product two times less while doing 

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:56.530
 all the same as other brushes for 

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:58.720
 tonal foundations are great here 

00:02:56.530 --> 00:03:01.659
 these hairs are fine give a product 

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:04.720
 make the perfect cover love her very much 

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:07.959
 and now I have become such a favorite 

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:10.709
 for applying tone then number 125 

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:14.140
 Here she has such a little girlfriend 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:16.930
 first when I was planning to make an order 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:18.420
 it seemed to me that this would be the most 

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.920
 useless brush set 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:24.010
 turned out to be my favorite, which I 

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:26.170
 I use every day so little 

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:28.719
 duo she has short fiber 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:30.849
 I was just embarrassed that the pile is this 

00:03:28.719 --> 00:03:33.219
 white short i think well how is it at all 

00:03:30.849 --> 00:03:35.829
 will work where it is and I am very 

00:03:33.219 --> 00:03:36.609
 cool she came up with it more precisely it's not me 

00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:39.640
 came up with 

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:42.819
 a long time ago I saw it put 

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:45.879
 cream blush and generally just fine 

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:47.950
 super she works with this task 

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:51.730
 copes fine and dry blush on 

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:56.349
 perfectly applied and for this purpose she 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:58.930
 did not become a favorite next brush such 

00:03:56.349 --> 00:04:01.989
 here is the beveled it is intended for 

00:03:58.930 --> 00:04:03.849
 contouring stated in principle 

00:04:01.989 --> 00:04:06.430
 contouring it is convenient and easy 

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:09.670
 apply tonal means she is everywhere 

00:04:06.430 --> 00:04:12.310
 Podlazit well stuffed they basically in 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:19.030
 the result is that the first thing is stuffed 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:21.700
 equally plump is number 103 

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:24.700
 generally very comfortable brush especially 

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:28.780
 if a person does not have large facial features 

00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:31.870
 very comfortable 9 crawl this brush 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:34.949
 also became my favorite this number 110 

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:37.090
 such a brush fingers very comfortable 

00:04:34.949 --> 00:04:40.530
 work through the area under the eyes about 

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:43.259
 night a doll of lips where it is necessary to crawl 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:46.389
 great to do your job great 

00:04:43.259 --> 00:04:51.120
 shading does not pull the skin in general everything 

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:53.729
 in not fine further powder brush 

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:55.830
 synthetic so fluffy 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:58.360
 rounded 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:05:02.560
 I can't say anything about him 

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:03.630
 hands do not stretch puts light wali 

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:06.450
 Not all 

00:05:03.630 --> 00:05:07.940
 loves not everyone will understand that, in principle, too 

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:11.480
 the farm is useful 

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:16.410
 Next comes natural brushes 

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:18.390
 they go from goat goat very soft even 

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:20.970
 I am more reminded of a cat Sudan 

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:23.910
 wash it very fluffy soft 

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:27.960
 absolutely not prick this number 101 she 

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:29.780
 as made as a torch trimmed 

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:33.630
 such a ladder 

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:36.000
 very convenient to apply powder and also her 

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:40.890
 can and about compete and bronzer 

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:45.240
 apply also a very good way further 

00:05:40.890 --> 00:05:48.090
 here is such a number 101 there it is 

00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:50.550
 number 105 is the same brush only 

00:05:48.090 --> 00:05:53.010
 small designed for highlighter 

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:55.320
 Well, as for the highlighter probably a little bit 

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:59.820
 too big but basically i was trying 

00:05:55.320 --> 00:06:01.590
 well she does this thing more 

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:04.140
 I use to fasten 

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:05.850
 corrector under eyes powder very 

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:11.750
 ok yes, choke up is very soft and 

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:15.840
 further pleasant here is such a brush 127 

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:18.240
 skew for contouring or rouge 

00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:22.260
 great fits great makes your 

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:26.130
 work in general big on at not saying 

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:28.320
 nothing but this here is its quite 

00:06:26.130 --> 00:06:31.860
 I replaced and more often and on customers 

00:06:28.320 --> 00:06:36.180
 I use than on myself the following brush 

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:37.620
 number 109 and and I didn't understand at all we didn't 

00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:41.150
 do just 

00:06:37.620 --> 00:06:43.080
 slap light and try 

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:46.020
 compete and pretend to slap 

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:48.120
 then it's hard to shade the odd somehow and 

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:50.160
 no friends in principle son of 

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:51.870
 made a tough correction probably quite 

00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:54.050
 can I still teach 

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:54.050
 to use
