00:00:04.850 --> 00:00:09.990
 these two days we left 

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.040
 so there was a big team in it 

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.769
 is twelve div 

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:16.470
 it's a college who came behind the 

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:19.050
 last to a beer with a party 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.270
 they are not all from there the same do 

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.930
 a first a first approach to the 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.289
 high mountain 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.449
 there is the same in cd rims have never 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.789
 put the crampons 

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:31.949
 so for two problems of details put 

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:34.620
 my and we stayed we did the 

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:37.500
 first night after the head and to be the 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:40.219
 head we go to the demining dome and we 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:43.320
 sleeps a descendant refused to built 

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:45.780
 traits head go to dom it's done 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:50.190
 a bit long but at the same time we stay 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:51.230
 o'meara above is one thing for 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.840
 the other 

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:58.050
 so you the race we went 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:01.829
 for this purpose the wounds the profiles of 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:05.190
 people dom dom has crossed dom it's 

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:07.950
 no one is a race that is really 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:09.620
 very very beautiful where we can enjoy 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.960
 really had to 

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:13.340
 relief of the arts be his drawing is 

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.200
 very pure that we find here in the 

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:17.050
 massive to be at the head with 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.570
 really those very static races 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:24.140
 and without having too much altitude so its 

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:26.270
 common to 3007 not even yes which one 

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.350
 does not suffer too much latitude and we are 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.720
 really in a high medium 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.450
 mountain with edges of egg 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.920
 each side of the empty goal 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:36.110
 and then the holidays and who sits 

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:39.650
 dom actually it's done we have a 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:41.120
 perspective under the next dome and who 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:42.260
 does not have a lot of shopping because I 

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:45.170
 am good milk on the ridge and we have not 

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:46.730
 enough view fiona here on the back to back 

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:48.860
 black aesthetic side that is really 

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:50.030
 very very beautiful a ridge that was taken 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.100
 many times in photo 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.730
 even to show other summits 

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.730
 investigate fear 

00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:01.140
 so today so we do not have 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.909
 crossed the dom 1 because it was good 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.289
 it was not people who were 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:06.689
 prepared for that you still have to be 

00:02:04.289 --> 00:02:08.039
 comfortable crampon not just for 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:10.170
 crossing the dom and for the big 

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.610
 downhill who after to join to 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.920
 beregister if not when one makes the trace 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.269
 and dom you have to go down a big 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.620
 pump to go to the collar to 

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:18.989
 go back to the bergÃ¨re 

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.269
 belittling from here to the built and this 

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:24.410
 Lake cast is very much supported his request 

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:28.110
 details well used to crampon 

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:30.360
 so turned arrived at the central dome a 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.160
 domme collar and central dance which 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.760
 already made a great race we saw on 

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.280
 the edges 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:38.579
 we saw on the valley bionnassay of 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:41.040
 the other side is really a very 

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:44.209
 very nice race for this type of people 

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.209
 who have audiences
