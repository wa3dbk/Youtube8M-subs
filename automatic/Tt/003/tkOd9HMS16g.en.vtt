00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.410
 vision tv signal that transform 

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:06.410
 we continue 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.150
 Hello, it's good that they see us again 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.340
 name is sarah and how good they are 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:15.930
 watching this program talking about and good 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.820
 in this section we are going to make a 

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:19.950
 small a small detail for your house 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.480
 let's make a crown of spheres that 

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:23.939
 it's going to look really nice because it's going to be 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:27.329
 very colorful and good this Christmas I 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:29.820
 I remind you that we have the commitment and 

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:31.950
 that God has created us to give love to 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.079
 others especially our family to 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:35.910
 our friends and well this would be a 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:39.059
 nice detail you can do in this 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:43.020
 Christmas to go to give it away I do not know to you to 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.940
 your aunts to put in your house to the 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:46.890
 children will like it a lot as it has 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:49.230
 a lot of colorful depending obviously on 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.030
 your tastes and well let's start what 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.070
 only you need good me here I have 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.740
 some colored spheres these are the 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.180
 colors that I chose for this day but 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:59.460
 well you can take the colors and 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.650
 sizes that you like most I have some 

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.840
 very tiny because right now they will see 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:06.210
 how are we going to do it a few 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:08.230
 little bit bigger and good too 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.330
 we need 

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:12.010
 to hunger that is thin so that it 

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:14.710
 can go through the sphere right now they're going to 

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:16.750
 see we're going to need a base too 

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:19.270
 You can find this circular in 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:21.360
 craft stores or even 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:25.120
 you can do them, it's not very 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:27.310
 complicated is a wire because thin 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:30.730
 but that although it is resistant you have 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:33.010
 to do two circles together you 

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:34.900
 you can put a third circle or four 

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:38.560
 if you like a smaller one or 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:40.720
 one bigger and depending on what size 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.520
 of crown you want to have this is a is 

00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.800
 a Medianite crown but good is not 

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.840
 I would miss a large crown on the door 

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:49.840
 from your house we are also going to need a 

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:51.970
 lighter like this and some tweezers and that 

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.320
 can cut the wire ok 

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:56.250
 well, the only thing we have to 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:59.070
 to do is take a wire 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:03.300
 that will be like half a meter depending 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:06.479
 of the size we develop them and we are going to 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:09.990
 have our sphere on hand we are going to 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:12.390
 do the inside part first 

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:14.490
 I recommend that this part we are going to put 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:15.870
 here the spheres are that they are spheres 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:18.030
 little girls then well I'm going to 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.680
 start with the little ones what we have 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.930
 what are you going to find 

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:24.540
 obviously the spheres in this way 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:27.600
 that has a little head here where 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:30.950
 the tree is hung but with the tweezers 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.950
 we're going to have to take it off 

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:36.600
 because the wire is going to go through 

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:38.910
 Look, this is how we 're going to stay with him 

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:41.010
 with the ojito because that 's where we're going to 

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:43.709
 pass the wire we will have it in the 

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:45.690
 same hand but because we have to 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:49.490
 react fast with the lighter 

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:49.490
 let's heat the wire 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:57.250
 enough for him to get through 

00:02:53.830 --> 00:03:00.550
 then we put the wire 

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:02.140
 to the logic of the sphere and it goes through 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:03.970
 with him with pure heat he goes to 

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:06.250
 go through then good is not so 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:08.200
 complicated so we are going to go putting a 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:10.690
 for one I was playing with the colors 

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:13.090
 obviously if you like it very 

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:15.580
 colorful let's put him I do not know about three 

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:18.600
 or four colors 

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:18.600
 we do the same 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:23.780
 and well we will go through 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:26.000
 some are going to have to try two or 

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:29.840
 three times because then you get to 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:31.660
 obviously cooling the wire but if 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:33.970
 they will go past 

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:35.830
 and well then so you're going to put 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:39.569
 you are going to heat 

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:43.859
 the wire you pass the sphere 

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:47.280
 I remove and good step then good you go 

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:48.989
 to go making all your row of spheres 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:51.329
 that are staying in this way until 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:53.810
 that I complete is the whole circle I have 

00:03:51.329 --> 00:03:56.940
 here already one prepared 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:59.460
 the whole circle but I already finished it 

00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:02.050
 see to think the wire that had them 

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:05.560
 commented I finished 

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:06.970
 all spheres wire the only thing that 

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:09.280
 you have to do since you have your 

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:10.960
 spheres wire is taut with a 

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:14.860
 small wire towards the circular base 

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:17.860
 then good you will choose twist little 

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:20.980
 and then it will be stretched to the 

00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:23.830
 base and you will stay like this 

00:04:20.980 --> 00:04:25.840
 you are going to continue with all the circles 

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:27.880
 what have you done here for example like me 

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:29.500
 I told them I have two but good 

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:32.260
 you can put two or three 

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:34.690
 even a bigger one so that for 

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:36.910
 that looks nicer in this way you 

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:40.530
 you are going to continue and I will teach you how I 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:43.630
 I have everything already armed so they would be 

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:45.580
 this is a good sphere a crown of 

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:48.160
 many colors you can choose if 

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:51.250
 they want to do it in golden 

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:55.300
 red some combination that you like 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:56.770
 well this is very colorful because it is a 

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:58.630
 detail that I will give and good to me 

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:01.270
 Mom likes colors a lot because of 

00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:03.460
 last to you nothing else they put a 

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:05.710
 small ribbon from the top 

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:07.690
 because it 's where you're going to hang up ok and you 

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:10.210
 will be in this way remember that 

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:13.120
 only wire and spheres there is no no 

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:15.580
 another and with the lighter at hand and 

00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:17.500
 with that you can go through the spheres ok 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:19.210
 Well thank you very much for having us 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:20.770
 seen in this little capsule follow 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:23.800
 seeing talking about why it 's very 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:25.930
 interesting and good I remind you that in 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:28.390
 this Christmas you have to share make a 

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:30.190
 small detail for your family and arrive 

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:32.530
 there is no better thing than the one 

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:34.390
 makes by hand and can give good but 

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:36.720
 I wish you a merry christmas the pass 

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:36.720
 very good 

00:05:38.869 --> 00:05:44.690
 would be the transport 

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:44.690
 Y
