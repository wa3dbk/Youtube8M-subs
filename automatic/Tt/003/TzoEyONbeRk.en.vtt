00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:24.669

 video to comment a couple of things 

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:36.280
 first of all let's read what it says 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.870
 here hello welcome to my map rules 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.850
 do not break blocks unless you get 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:42.160
 also say what is nothing until it 

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:44.320
 tell you and you do not have fun clear 

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:49.360
 I'm going to have fun while better 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:51.970
 very good if you do a go we guess 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:54.570

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:57.160

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.530
 peaceful distance distance 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.720
 peaceful difficulties I do not have there well 

00:00:59.530 --> 00:01:03.850
 and nothing we see that here you do not forget 

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:07.509
 to visit my channel is the sports channel 

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:08.870
 and nothing happened here says level 1 

00:01:07.509 --> 00:01:12.380
 Parkour 

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:15.140
 that's a plan to equip me I'm me in 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:17.390
 the parkour of minecraft because I do not have 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:19.310
 what to say but well let's get 

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.290
 that around here and nothing what I wanted 

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:25.120
 comment was that many have been 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:27.580
 asking hey why do not you go up 

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:29.580
 maps and videos of what would be rather 

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:32.740
 created by which edition of the waters 

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:35.800
 precisely from the 0.9 zero point because 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:38.110
 is in alfaz and they are trial versions 

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:40.570
 and many months but come on and I can not 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:42.310
 load and all things ok but to me not 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:46.330
 I like to upload something that is proof 

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:48.790
 it's just my thing if I'm very, I do not know 

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:51.910
 how to say it very ha with that kind of 

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:54.370
 things and there the truth is that's why 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:56.890
 that there were not any, there's no other reason 

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:58.660
 I do not like playing tryouts me 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.640
 like to play it that is already finished what 

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:03.040
 that is already ready for us to play and 

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.050
 so I think it's much better to play I do not know 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:09.360
 but no one when you leave the 

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:09.360
 final version the only benito 

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:23.599
 they stayed there around here and which ones do not 

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.099
 can 

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:27.829
 Well, if you can, let's go because I'm a 

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:31.190
 rookie they look at all me because they fly are 

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:32.390
 good and the truth is that I do not know why 

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:35.640
 I'm flying because I just do not 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:38.700
 Let's say let's say forbidden 

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:41.340
 this is a pattern but nothing like that 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:44.790
 forbidden the passage we continue here 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:46.260
 here a checkpoint and it does not do it because 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.810
 It is day and I do not want to be until the 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:51.260
 night and you'll regret it later but 

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:55.470
 follow below 

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:59.960
 ok that puts here and breaks the block where 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:01.550
 there's the sign that says spoiled 

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:04.070
 to 

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:06.890
 at the same time it breaks the block where the 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:11.020
 sign 15 trolling ok we break it from 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:11.020
 that block adds up badly several years 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:23.319
 here is your exit pass ok and what is 

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:26.620
 my father dahlias hello 

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:28.790
 I have to break here friends you have to 

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:32.090
 learn to search well 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:35.409
 ok here you are my outlet passes and 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.409
 we have to learn to search well 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:43.540
 Well, it's not really a crisis. 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:46.060
 here troll to yes 

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:48.790
 You can now pass the prohibited place and 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:53.019
 break the fence dies to return to 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:54.270
 that fuck I do not want because I want to 

00:03:53.019 --> 00:04:00.390
 here 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:04:04.380
 come come and it can not be here in the 

00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:06.900
 third that we are going to do parkour 

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:09.690
 again but they did not count on me 

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:12.450
 They taught to fly the bread ok 

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:14.310
 nothing that is a sucker of this and it 

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:17.850
 assumes that it is about to pass environments is 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:20.459

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:25.320

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:32.220
 breaking savater was supposed to be what I 

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:35.780

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:40.460
 permission to pass and put the key 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:44.139
 Glow are glow and by the key friend that 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:44.139

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:51.370

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:55.960
 cancer that theater read 2 and after the 

00:04:51.370 --> 00:05:00.810
 key is that ok now I break in here with 

00:04:55.960 --> 00:05:03.710

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:07.230

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:12.980
 Lawless 

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:15.740
