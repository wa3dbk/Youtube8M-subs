with that information we're able to

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:23.329 
with that information we're able to
gauge<00:00:21.509> if<00:00:21.900> the<00:00:22.050> student<00:00:22.470> has<00:00:22.619> the<00:00:22.650> social

the intervention that they need and push
them<00:00:35.730> forward<00:00:36.210> in<00:00:36.330> that<00:00:36.480> area<00:00:36.900> if<00:00:37.170> they're

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
them forward in that area if they're

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:51.440 
them forward in that area if they're
ready<00:00:37.650> I<00:00:49.040> found<00:00:50.040> that<00:00:50.190> it<00:00:50.340> was<00:00:50.370> very<00:00:50.820> nice<00:00:51.150> in

my<00:00:51.480> classroom<00:00:52.200> it<00:00:52.380> was<00:00:52.530> tested<00:00:52.890> over<00:00:53.040> a<00:00:53.220> long

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:53.490 
my classroom it was tested over a long

my classroom it was tested over a long
period<00:00:53.970> of<00:00:54.030> time<00:00:54.300> as<00:00:54.600> opposed<00:00:55.260> to<00:00:55.380> the<00:00:55.560> crawl

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.070 
period of time as opposed to the crawl
where<00:00:56.460> we<00:00:56.610> set<00:00:56.910> up<00:00:56.940> appointments<00:00:57.870> for<00:00:58.020> the

00:00:58.070 --> 00:00:58.080 
where we set up appointments for the

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:01.100 
where we set up appointments for the
students<00:00:58.590> to<00:00:58.740> come<00:00:58.950> in<00:00:59.220> in<00:00:59.520> the<00:01:00.060> past<00:01:00.240> and<00:01:00.810> they

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:01.110 
students to come in in the past and they

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:03.350 
students to come in in the past and they
would<00:01:01.290> be<00:01:01.440> tested<00:01:01.890> over<00:01:02.010> one<00:01:02.310> or<00:01:02.460> two<00:01:02.640> days<00:01:02.910> and

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:03.360 
would be tested over one or two days and

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.749 
would be tested over one or two days and
I<00:01:03.900> found<00:01:04.259> that<00:01:04.530> when<00:01:04.890> we<00:01:04.949> did<00:01:05.189> that<00:01:05.430> sometimes

00:01:05.749 --> 00:01:05.759 
I found that when we did that sometimes

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:07.490 
I found that when we did that sometimes
the<00:01:06.210> students<00:01:06.600> would<00:01:06.750> come<00:01:06.900> in<00:01:07.050> they<00:01:07.230> would<00:01:07.350> be

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
the students would come in they would be

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.820 
the students would come in they would be
nervous<00:01:08.180> they<00:01:09.180> would<00:01:09.330> not<00:01:09.480> necessarily

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:09.830 
nervous they would not necessarily

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.880 
nervous they would not necessarily
interact<00:01:10.830> with<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.159> teacher<00:01:12.680> using<00:01:13.680> the<00:01:13.770> new

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890

interact with the teacher using the new
assessment<00:01:14.400> results<00:01:14.580> an<00:01:15.120> example<00:01:15.720> would<00:01:15.840> be

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:15.900 
assessment results an example would be

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.100 
assessment results an example would be
if<00:01:16.320> I<00:01:16.920> pulled<00:01:17.430> a<00:01:17.520> child<00:01:17.729> over<00:01:18.150> and<00:01:18.479> I<00:01:18.810> asked

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
if I pulled a child over and I asked

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:20.899 
if I pulled a child over and I asked
them<00:01:19.229> if<00:01:19.650> they<00:01:19.920> could<00:01:20.100> tell<00:01:20.250> me<00:01:20.310> I<00:01:20.610> told<00:01:20.640> them

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
them if they could tell me I told them

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:23.060 
them if they could tell me I told them
what<00:01:21.060> letter<00:01:21.240> it<00:01:21.390> was<00:01:21.540> and<00:01:21.930> I<00:01:22.500> asked<00:01:22.800> them<00:01:22.920> what

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
what letter it was and I asked them what

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.440 
what letter it was and I asked them what
sound<00:01:23.310> does<00:01:23.430> it<00:01:23.490> make<00:01:23.640> and<00:01:24.030> if<00:01:24.120> they<00:01:24.210> were<00:01:24.270> not

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
sound does it make and if they were not

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.810 
sound does it make and if they were not
able<00:01:24.690> to<00:01:24.810> do<00:01:25.110> it<00:01:25.290> it<00:01:25.620> would<00:01:25.830> help<00:01:25.979> me<00:01:26.250> drive<00:01:26.640> my

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
able to do it it would help me drive my

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.610 
able to do it it would help me drive my
instruction<00:01:26.850> to<00:01:27.600> pull<00:01:28.020> them<00:01:28.170> in<00:01:28.290> a<00:01:28.350> small

their<00:01:35.610> letter<00:01:35.820> sons<00:01:36.120> I<00:01:36.270> would<00:01:36.510> pull<00:01:36.690> them<00:01:36.840> over

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:37.080

in<00:01:37.200> a<00:01:37.260> small<00:01:37.500> group<00:01:37.770> and<00:01:37.950> if<00:01:38.310> I<00:01:38.400> also<00:01:38.580> noticed

00:01:39.289 --> 00:01:39.299 
in a small group and if I also noticed

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.780 
in a small group and if I also noticed
that<00:01:39.630> the<00:01:40.229> whole<00:01:40.380> group<00:01:40.620> my<00:01:41.070> whole<00:01:41.280> group<00:01:41.640> was

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:41.790 
that the whole group my whole group was

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:43.130 
that the whole group my whole group was
struggling<00:01:42.180> with<00:01:42.299> it<00:01:42.360> we<00:01:42.600> would<00:01:42.720> do<00:01:42.840> a<00:01:42.870> whole

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
struggling with it we would do a whole

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:45.320 
struggling with it we would do a whole
group<00:01:43.350> instruction<00:01:43.710> on<00:01:44.130> it<00:01:44.310> and<00:01:44.490> reteach<00:01:44.909> and

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:45.330 
group instruction on it and reteach and

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.030 
group instruction on it and reteach and
keep<00:01:45.810> practicing<00:01:46.530> with<00:01:46.650> it

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
keep practicing with it

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.219 
keep practicing with it
you<00:01:47.460> could<00:01:47.729> fit<00:01:48.119> it<00:01:48.150> right<00:01:48.390> into<00:01:48.570> the<00:01:48.900> daily

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 
you could fit it right into the daily

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.370 
you could fit it right into the daily
schedule<00:01:49.500> as<00:01:49.830> a<00:01:49.920> classroom<00:01:50.250> I<00:01:51.090> would<00:01:52.049> do<00:01:52.260> it

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
schedule as a classroom I would do it

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:54.260 
schedule as a classroom I would do it
during<00:01:52.530> center<00:01:53.040> time<00:01:53.250> it<00:01:53.670> just<00:01:53.850> worked<00:01:54.060> really

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
during center time it just worked really

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.120 
during center time it just worked really
well<00:01:54.390> with<00:01:54.570> the<00:01:54.930> daily<00:01:55.229> routine<00:01:55.650> and<00:01:56.040> it

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:56.130 
well with the daily routine and it

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:58.070 
well with the daily routine and it
worked<00:01:56.280> well<00:01:56.490> with<00:01:56.640> my<00:01:56.820> classroom<00:01:57.330> I<00:01:57.540> think

00:01:58.070 --> 00:01:58.080 
worked well with my classroom I think

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.140 
worked well with my classroom I think
the<00:01:58.439> children<00:01:58.860> will<00:01:59.070> really<00:01:59.310> enjoy<00:01:59.820> having

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:00.150 
the children will really enjoy having
