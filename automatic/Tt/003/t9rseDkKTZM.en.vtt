00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:09.700
 Hello, today's video will be 

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:12.130
 fasting days 

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:13.800
 what is the fasting day why they 

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:15.849
 need and whether they sell our expectations 

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:17.680
 if you look on the internet 

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:19.779
 the number of varieties of these most 

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.550
 fasting days just do not count 

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:24.460
 someone offer to sit a day on 

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:26.529
 kefir someone on watermelon or another than 

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:29.020
 Generally just crazy for some but 

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:33.070
 Does it help losing weight after all? 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:34.540
 we sit down for a lifestyle change 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.210
 its nutrition to lose weight 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:39.489
 In my opinion, reducing the diet by one 

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.650
 day does not lead to ignition even if 

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:43.089
 morning you see the answer on the scales yes you 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:45.370
 can feel better 

00:00:43.089 --> 00:00:47.170
 but as soon as you start eating normal 

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:49.030
 food picks up nutrients 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:50.890
 then the whole will come back sometimes even with 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:52.269
 in excess I can say that the discharge 

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:54.360
 the day is completely ineffective 

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:56.440
 if you haven't looked after your food 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:58.030
 regularly and not pick up for yourself 

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:59.949
 some kind of optimal physical exertion 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.479
 I often love my practice 

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:03.400
 give some examples and now 

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:06.250
 I will give an example imagine you have a car 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:06.940
 constantly refuel with gasoline 

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:08.920
 by their own business 

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.750
 but then you decide they will and I today and 

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.109
 and fill up with gas and tomorrow perhaps 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.939
 also 

00:01:11.109 --> 00:01:16.000
 and gasoline you already ends and rather 

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:17.500
 just you will not go far in general the same 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.359
 most can be said about our body 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.829
 I personally do not advise to deprive myself 

00:01:19.359 --> 00:01:22.990
 full balanced nutrition 

00:01:20.829 --> 00:01:24.880
 not for one day if there is no 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.979
 specific reasons such as 

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.170
 poisoning hope none of you 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:31.359
 like it but everyone probably heard and 

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.009
 know that when you go 

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:35.109
 some food you can not eat then 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:37.719
 some time so i can say 

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:39.399
 that any one is severely limited and food is 

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:41.289
 calorie content always slows down our exchange 

00:01:39.399 --> 00:01:42.609
 substances that we want the opposite 

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:44.289
 accelerate to lose weight 

00:01:42.609 --> 00:01:45.460
 if you are constantly day-to-day and 

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:47.710
 stick to normal 

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:49.810
 balanced nutrition you follow 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:51.460
 do not break yourself or understand that 

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.469
 yours does not exist at all this is yours 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.899
 new lifestyle then such unloading 

00:01:53.469 --> 00:01:56.950
 days to supposedly lose weight faster 

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:57.690
 only become stress for your 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:58.710
 of the body 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:01.590
 it can also provoke 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.600
 overeating the next day and it will 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.430
 I would absolutely like to be here 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:07.920
 remind you that I already took off 

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:10.380
 boot day video this 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.820
 chatting is called this day when you 

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:13.380
 on the contrary these more than usual 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:15.870
 preferably at the expense of the right products 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:18.000
 and it gives a kick to your metabolism 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.500

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.660

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:23.460
