00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:45.680 
what you got want to do is place down

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:52.869 
what you got want to do is place down
for<00:00:46.989> more<00:00:49.329> levers<00:00:51.039> I'll<00:00:52.039> go<00:00:52.250> in<00:00:52.370> sets<00:00:52.699> of<00:00:52.820> two

00:00:52.869 --> 00:00:52.879 
for more levers I'll go in sets of two

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:57.069 
for more levers I'll go in sets of two
you<00:00:53.300> can<00:00:53.539> do<00:00:53.739> a<00:00:54.739> an<00:00:55.340> odd<00:00:55.579> number<00:00:55.879> but<00:00:56.510> it<00:00:56.809> makes

00:00:57.069 --> 00:00:57.079 
you can do a an odd number but it makes

00:00:57.079 --> 00:00:59.950 
you can do a an odd number but it makes
a<00:00:57.199> lot<00:00:57.379> harder<00:00:57.680> I<00:00:58.090> just<00:00:59.090> punched<00:00:59.390> out<00:00:59.629> some

00:00:59.950 --> 00:00:59.960 
a lot harder I just punched out some

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:04.029 
a lot harder I just punched out some
holes<00:01:00.260> so<00:01:00.680> I<00:01:01.129> can<00:01:01.879> see<00:01:02.210> through<00:01:02.989> the<00:01:03.469> wall<00:01:03.739> and

00:01:04.029 --> 00:01:04.039 
holes so I can see through the wall and

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:06.790 
holes so I can see through the wall and
it's<00:01:04.550> easy<00:01:04.759> a<00:01:04.879> line<00:01:05.149> up<00:01:05.390> these<00:01:06.229> blocks<00:01:06.560> I'm

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:06.800 
it's easy a line up these blocks I'm

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:15.240 
it's easy a line up these blocks I'm
gonna<00:01:07.009> place<00:01:07.250> down<00:01:07.490> behind<00:01:08.119> the<00:01:09.369> believers

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:15.250 

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.640 

basically<00:01:16.250> how<00:01:16.430> lever<00:01:16.759> works<00:01:17.090> is<00:01:17.420> it<00:01:18.259> sends<00:01:18.590> a

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:18.650 
basically how lever works is it sends a

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.100 
basically how lever works is it sends a
signal<00:01:18.680> through<00:01:19.189> the<00:01:19.640> block<00:01:19.909> and<00:01:20.210> a<00:01:20.720> collie

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:21.110 
signal through the block and a collie

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:26.200 
signal through the block and a collie
travel<00:01:22.150> distance<00:01:23.150> of<00:01:23.299> one<00:01:23.420> block<00:01:23.689> so<00:01:25.060> to<00:01:26.060> get

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.210 
travel distance of one block so to get

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:28.030 
travel distance of one block so to get
the<00:01:26.360> signal<00:01:26.780> it<00:01:26.990> can<00:01:27.140> either<00:01:27.259> be<00:01:27.409> underneath

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:28.040 
the signal it can either be underneath

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:35.170 
the signal it can either be underneath
it<00:01:29.170> it<00:01:30.170> could<00:01:30.409> be<00:01:30.710> behind<00:01:31.610> it<00:01:33.460> it<00:01:34.460> could<00:01:34.670> be<00:01:34.820> on

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:35.180 
it it could be behind it it could be on

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:40.460 
it it could be behind it it could be on
top<00:01:35.450> of<00:01:35.479> it

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:40.470 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.370 

or<00:01:41.160> of<00:01:41.340> course<00:01:41.370> it<00:01:41.910> could<00:01:42.120> also<00:01:42.540> be<00:01:42.780> in<00:01:43.140> front

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:43.380 
or of course it could also be in front

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:52.460 
or of course it could also be in front
of<00:01:43.530> it<00:01:47.180> yeah<00:01:49.760> so<00:01:50.760> that's<00:01:51.000> just<00:01:51.390> the<00:01:51.570> basis<00:01:52.230> of

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
of it yeah so that's just the basis of

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.170 
of it yeah so that's just the basis of
have<00:01:53.130> leavers<00:01:53.640> work<00:01:54.530> so<00:01:55.530> i<00:01:55.920> gotta<00:01:56.610> just<00:01:56.790> repair

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:57.180 
have leavers work so i gotta just repair

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:01.670 
have leavers work so i gotta just repair
this<00:01:57.330> wall<00:01:57.570> now<00:01:57.780> that<00:01:58.260> I<00:01:58.290> have<00:01:58.830> my<00:02:00.500> levers<00:02:01.500> all

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
this wall now that I have my levers all

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:16.910 
this wall now that I have my levers all
set<00:02:01.950> up<00:02:03.500> and<00:02:06.770> did<00:02:07.770> I<00:02:07.920> miss<00:02:08.190> one<00:02:15.800> that's<00:02:16.800> why

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:16.920 
set up and did I miss one that's why

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.600 
set up and did I miss one that's why
that<00:02:17.100> I<00:02:17.220> skipped<00:02:17.520> over<00:02:17.640> one<00:02:17.970> sorry<00:02:18.450> guys<00:02:19.610> it

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
that I skipped over one sorry guys it

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:23.750 
that I skipped over one sorry guys it
should<00:02:20.970> be<00:02:21.000> lined<00:02:21.300> up<00:02:21.480> now<00:02:22.010> okay<00:02:23.010> so<00:02:23.070> I'm<00:02:23.550> going

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
should be lined up now okay so I'm going

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.820 
should be lined up now okay so I'm going
to<00:02:23.790> start<00:02:24.030> off<00:02:24.180> by<00:02:24.270> placing<00:02:24.720> some<00:02:25.620> redstone

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:25.830 
to start off by placing some redstone

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:29.750 
to start off by placing some redstone
right<00:02:26.730> behind<00:02:27.120> the<00:02:28.050> levers<00:02:29.040> on<00:02:29.340> each<00:02:29.520> one<00:02:29.700> of

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
right behind the levers on each one of

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.510 
right behind the levers on each one of
these<00:02:29.910> four<00:02:30.180> blocks<00:02:30.450> and<00:02:30.980> then<00:02:31.980> I'm<00:02:32.310> going

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:32.520 
these four blocks and then I'm going

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:37.340 
these four blocks and then I'm going
extend<00:02:32.940> the<00:02:33.000> lines<00:02:33.209> down<00:02:33.740> two<00:02:34.740> spaces<00:02:36.350> then

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:37.350 
extend the lines down two spaces then

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:39.080 
extend the lines down two spaces then
I'm<00:02:37.590> going<00:02:37.800> to<00:02:37.860> build<00:02:38.100> an<00:02:38.430> end<00:02:38.640> gate<00:02:38.850> and

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
I'm going to build an end gate and

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:44.830 
I'm going to build an end gate and
basically<00:02:39.450> one<00:02:39.750> and<00:02:39.990> gate<00:02:40.170> consists<00:02:40.770> of<00:02:40.980> is<00:02:43.190> to

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:44.840 
basically one and gate consists of is to

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:48.410 
basically one and gate consists of is to
actually<00:02:45.840> a<00:02:46.230> row<00:02:46.890> of<00:02:47.100> three<00:02:47.340> blocks<00:02:47.880> and<00:02:48.269> then

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
actually a row of three blocks and then

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:51.979 
actually a row of three blocks and then
through<00:02:49.230> torches<00:02:49.680> on<00:02:49.830> top<00:02:50.780> redstone<00:02:51.780> in<00:02:51.900> the

00:02:51.979 --> 00:02:51.989 
through torches on top redstone in the

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:54.979 
through torches on top redstone in the
mill<00:02:52.170> and<00:02:53.060> that<00:02:54.060> another<00:02:54.269> torch<00:02:54.600> on<00:02:54.750> the<00:02:54.840> back

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:54.989 
mill and that another torch on the back

00:02:54.989 --> 00:03:00.040 
mill and that another torch on the back
and<00:02:56.180> basically<00:02:57.180> what<00:02:58.080> this<00:02:58.290> works<00:02:58.650> as<00:02:58.920> is

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.050 
and basically what this works as is

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:05.870 
and basically what this works as is
let's<00:03:01.050> say<00:03:01.230> I<00:03:01.260> flip<00:03:01.739> all<00:03:01.980> these<00:03:02.190> on<00:03:04.400> then<00:03:05.400> it

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:05.880 
let's say I flip all these on then it

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.570 
let's say I flip all these on then it
will<00:03:06.030> turn<00:03:06.330> off<00:03:06.620> both<00:03:07.620> of<00:03:07.650> these<00:03:07.950> redstone

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:08.580 
will turn off both of these redstone

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:12.410 
will turn off both of these redstone
torches<00:03:08.940> and<00:03:10.250> therefore<00:03:11.250> letting<00:03:11.880> the

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:12.420 
torches and therefore letting the

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:16.140 
torches and therefore letting the
redstone<00:03:12.930> torch<00:03:13.230> on<00:03:13.470> the<00:03:13.590> back<00:03:13.799> be<00:03:14.549> lit<00:03:14.820> up

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
redstone torch on the back be lit up

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:20.819 
redstone torch on the back be lit up
so<00:03:16.810> by<00:03:17.409> doing<00:03:17.470> that<00:03:18.480> you<00:03:19.480> can<00:03:19.750> sort<00:03:20.110> of<00:03:20.260> create

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:20.829 
so by doing that you can sort of create

00:03:20.829 --> 00:03:26.600 
so by doing that you can sort of create
like<00:03:21.189> a<00:03:21.220> little<00:03:21.640> bit<00:03:21.760> of<00:03:21.849> a<00:03:21.909> lock<00:03:22.120> system<00:03:25.590> then

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
like a little bit of a lock system then

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:28.860 
like a little bit of a lock system then
after<00:03:27.610> that<00:03:27.819> you're<00:03:28.000> going<00:03:28.180> to<00:03:28.269> need<00:03:28.629> make

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:28.870 
after that you're going to need make

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:32.910 
after that you're going to need make
another<00:03:29.260> and<00:03:29.590> gate<00:03:30.510> to<00:03:31.510> link<00:03:31.750> up<00:03:31.930> the<00:03:32.200> two<00:03:32.560> sets

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:32.920 
another and gate to link up the two sets

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:39.449 
another and gate to link up the two sets
of<00:03:33.810> leavers<00:03:34.810> that<00:03:35.170> you<00:03:35.260> have<00:03:35.349> gone<00:03:37.470> so<00:03:38.470> that<00:03:39.189> is

00:03:39.449 --> 00:03:39.459 
of leavers that you have gone so that is

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:45.420 
of leavers that you have gone so that is
now<00:03:40.239> linked<00:03:40.599> up<00:03:42.629> then<00:03:43.629> the<00:03:44.079> last<00:03:44.260> step<00:03:44.409> is<00:03:44.859> to

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:45.430 
now linked up then the last step is to

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:48.619 
now linked up then the last step is to
add<00:03:45.849> a<00:03:45.939> door<00:03:46.299> so<00:03:47.290> I'm<00:03:47.650> going<00:03:47.829> to<00:03:47.859> add<00:03:48.069> the<00:03:48.220> door

00:03:48.619 --> 00:03:48.629 
add a door so I'm going to add the door

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:55.710 
add a door so I'm going to add the door
yeah<00:03:49.629> and<00:03:50.609> then<00:03:53.280> now<00:03:54.280> that<00:03:54.310> will<00:03:54.790> only<00:03:55.030> that

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720 
yeah and then now that will only that

00:03:55.720 --> 00:04:00.509 
yeah and then now that will only that
door<00:03:55.989> will<00:03:56.560> only<00:03:56.799> open<00:03:57.099> if<00:03:58.980> the<00:03:59.980> combinations

00:04:00.509 --> 00:04:00.519 
door will only open if the combinations

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:02.369 
door will only open if the combinations
right<00:04:00.579> so<00:04:00.909> let's<00:04:01.090> say<00:04:01.269> flip<00:04:01.720> this<00:04:01.900> one<00:04:01.959> lever

00:04:02.369 --> 00:04:02.379 
right so let's say flip this one lever

00:04:02.379 --> 00:04:06.619 
right so let's say flip this one lever
even<00:04:03.220> though<00:04:03.340> these<00:04:03.930> three<00:04:04.930> levers<00:04:05.230> are<00:04:05.650> on

00:04:06.619 --> 00:04:06.629 
even though these three levers are on

00:04:06.629 --> 00:04:09.509 
even though these three levers are on
the<00:04:07.629> door<00:04:07.870> still<00:04:08.230> won't<00:04:08.409> open<00:04:08.739> because<00:04:08.920> the

00:04:09.509 --> 00:04:09.519 
the door still won't open because the

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:14.789 
the door still won't open because the
combination<00:04:10.090> is<00:04:10.120> wrong<00:04:11.489> so<00:04:13.079> that's<00:04:14.079> the<00:04:14.260> basis

00:04:14.789 --> 00:04:14.799 
combination is wrong so that's the basis

00:04:14.799 --> 00:04:16.740 
combination is wrong so that's the basis
of<00:04:14.980> them<00:04:15.220> now<00:04:15.909> if<00:04:16.060> you<00:04:16.180> want<00:04:16.359> to<00:04:16.419> change<00:04:16.570> the

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:16.750 
of them now if you want to change the

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:18.539 
of them now if you want to change the
combination<00:04:16.989> it's<00:04:17.560> actually<00:04:18.009> pretty<00:04:18.280> simple

00:04:18.539 --> 00:04:18.549 
combination it's actually pretty simple

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:21.330 
combination it's actually pretty simple
so<00:04:19.620> let's<00:04:20.620> say<00:04:20.769> I<00:04:20.799> want<00:04:20.979> to<00:04:21.039> change<00:04:21.190> the

00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:21.340 
so let's say I want to change the

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:31.370 
so let's say I want to change the
combination<00:04:21.549> to<00:04:23.580> on<00:04:24.870> off<00:04:25.870> off<00:04:26.470> on<00:04:28.500> so<00:04:29.500> now<00:04:30.340> as

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 
combination to on off off on so now as

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:33.719 
combination to on off off on so now as
you<00:04:32.380> can<00:04:32.500> see<00:04:32.560> it<00:04:32.919> doesn't<00:04:33.250> work<00:04:33.430> right<00:04:33.669> now

00:04:33.719 --> 00:04:33.729 
you can see it doesn't work right now

00:04:33.729 --> 00:04:36.779 
you can see it doesn't work right now
because<00:04:34.300> everything<00:04:34.930> set<00:04:35.199> it<00:04:35.409> being<00:04:35.680> on<00:04:35.860> so

00:04:36.779 --> 00:04:36.789 
because everything set it being on so

00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:38.129 
because everything set it being on so
what<00:04:37.180> we're<00:04:37.330> going<00:04:37.479> to<00:04:37.570> do<00:04:37.690> is<00:04:37.810> we're<00:04:37.990> gonna

00:04:38.129 --> 00:04:38.139 
what we're going to do is we're gonna

00:04:38.139 --> 00:04:42.420 
what we're going to do is we're gonna
remove<00:04:38.699> this<00:04:39.699> torch<00:04:40.090> and<00:04:40.389> that<00:04:40.750> torch<00:04:41.430> which

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:42.430 
remove this torch and that torch which

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:45.870 
remove this torch and that torch which
is<00:04:42.639> combined<00:04:43.120> with<00:04:43.270> the<00:04:43.599> two<00:04:44.380> levers<00:04:44.880> behind

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:45.880 
is combined with the two levers behind

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.540 
is combined with the two levers behind
that<00:04:46.090> door<00:04:46.270> the<00:04:46.570> two<00:04:46.720> male<00:04:46.960> leavers<00:04:47.380> and<00:04:47.620> we're

00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:48.550 
that door the two male leavers and we're

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:50.909 
that door the two male leavers and we're
going<00:04:48.760> to<00:04:48.820> just<00:04:49.030> replace<00:04:49.389> this<00:04:49.659> area<00:04:50.080> with<00:04:50.889> a

00:04:50.909 --> 00:04:50.919 
going to just replace this area with a

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:54.330 
going to just replace this area with a
little<00:04:51.370> bit<00:04:51.490> of<00:04:51.550> redstone<00:04:51.909> and<00:04:53.159> what's<00:04:54.159> like

00:04:54.330 --> 00:04:54.340 
little bit of redstone and what's like

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:58.800 
little bit of redstone and what's like
what<00:04:54.909> what<00:04:55.210> that<00:04:55.419> is<00:04:55.630> going<00:04:55.960> to<00:04:56.080> do<00:04:56.260> is<00:04:57.810> instead

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:58.810 
what what that is going to do is instead

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:02.219 
what what that is going to do is instead
of<00:04:59.159> inverting<00:05:00.159> the<00:05:00.280> signal<00:05:00.720> it's<00:05:01.720> going<00:05:02.110> to

00:05:02.219 --> 00:05:02.229 
of inverting the signal it's going to

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:06.710 
of inverting the signal it's going to
just<00:05:02.789> keep<00:05:03.789> the<00:05:03.970> signal<00:05:04.389> the<00:05:04.570> same<00:05:04.810> and<00:05:05.280> that

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:06.720 
just keep the signal the same and that

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:09.870 
just keep the signal the same and that
will<00:05:07.720> allow<00:05:08.139> you<00:05:08.199> to<00:05:08.400> change<00:05:09.400> the<00:05:09.669> combination

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:09.880 
will allow you to change the combination

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:12.089 
will allow you to change the combination
basically<00:05:10.659> so<00:05:10.870> right<00:05:11.199> now<00:05:11.229> the<00:05:11.409> combination

00:05:12.089 --> 00:05:12.099 
basically so right now the combination

00:05:12.099 --> 00:05:19.529 
basically so right now the combination
is<00:05:13.229> on<00:05:14.229> off<00:05:15.130> off<00:05:15.789> on<00:05:16.360> and<00:05:17.669> over<00:05:18.669> here<00:05:18.909> the<00:05:19.150> door

00:05:19.529 --> 00:05:19.539 
is on off off on and over here the door

00:05:19.539 --> 00:05:23.670 
is on off off on and over here the door
as<00:05:19.780> you<00:05:19.930> can<00:05:20.080> see<00:05:20.260> is<00:05:20.500> opened<00:05:21.099> up<00:05:21.250> and<00:05:22.440> just<00:05:23.440> for

00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:23.680 
as you can see is opened up and just for

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:26.730 
as you can see is opened up and just for
reference<00:05:23.860> if<00:05:24.310> you<00:05:24.490> turn<00:05:24.700> on<00:05:24.969> on<00:05:25.590> turn<00:05:26.590> them

00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:26.740 
reference if you turn on on turn them

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:27.990 
reference if you turn on on turn them
all<00:05:26.889> on

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:28.000 
all on

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.270 
all on
the<00:05:29.000> door<00:05:29.210> used<00:05:29.600> to<00:05:29.750> open<00:05:30.020> up<00:05:30.170> but<00:05:30.500> now<00:05:30.710> because

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:31.280 
the door used to open up but now because

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:34.480 
the door used to open up but now because
we<00:05:31.460> switch<00:05:31.730> this<00:05:32.000> around<00:05:32.060> the<00:05:32.630> door<00:05:33.490> doesn't

00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:34.490 
we switch this around the door doesn't

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:37.330 
we switch this around the door doesn't
open<00:05:34.730> anymore<00:05:35.140> so<00:05:36.140> that's<00:05:36.440> just<00:05:36.560> a<00:05:36.920> really

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:37.340 
open anymore so that's just a really

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:43.150 
open anymore so that's just a really
simple<00:05:39.880> mechanism<00:05:40.880> and<00:05:41.800> it's<00:05:42.800> a<00:05:42.860> really<00:05:43.040> easy

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:43.160 
simple mechanism and it's a really easy

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:45.310 
simple mechanism and it's a really easy
thing<00:05:43.640> to<00:05:43.790> do<00:05:43.940> with<00:05:44.090> redstone<00:05:44.300> and<00:05:44.600> I<00:05:45.110> would

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:45.320 
thing to do with redstone and I would

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:48.310 
thing to do with redstone and I would
recommend<00:05:46.100> it<00:05:46.640> because<00:05:47.030> it'll<00:05:47.930> keep<00:05:48.140> your

00:05:48.310 --> 00:05:48.320 
recommend it because it'll keep your

00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:50.380 
recommend it because it'll keep your
things<00:05:48.560> safe<00:05:48.800> especially<00:05:49.250> in<00:05:49.610> a<00:05:49.940> multiplayer

00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:50.390 
things safe especially in a multiplayer
