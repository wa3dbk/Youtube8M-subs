why<00:00:18.300> the<00:00:18.360> iPhone<00:00:18.570> 6<00:00:19.169> is<00:00:19.380> better<00:00:19.710> than<00:00:19.890> the

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
why the iPhone 6 is better than the

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:22.310 
why the iPhone 6 is better than the
galaxy<00:00:20.490> s5<00:00:20.849> I<00:00:21.210> will<00:00:21.660> also<00:00:21.869> be<00:00:21.990> making<00:00:22.020> a

galaxy s5 I will also be making a

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.350

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
galaxy s5 is better than iPhone 6 so

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:28.839
