00:00:38.979 --> 00:00:38.989 
use this one's a camcorder and this is a

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:41.330 
use this one's a camcorder and this is a
webcam<00:00:39.989> both<00:00:40.649> these<00:00:40.829> are<00:00:41.010> really<00:00:41.129> good

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:43.100 
because you don't have to touch the

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.440 
because you don't have to touch the
cameras<00:00:44.100> to<00:00:44.250> actually<00:00:44.489> take<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:44.850> pictures<00:00:45.239> i

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
cameras to actually take the pictures i

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.799 
cameras to actually take the pictures i
use<00:00:45.960> the<00:00:46.110> camcorder<00:00:46.590> primarily<00:00:47.070> but<00:00:47.940> a<00:00:48.210> webcam

can<00:00:48.989> be<00:00:49.079> very<00:00:49.289> good<00:00:49.469> because<00:00:49.620> a<00:00:49.920> lot<00:00:50.280> of

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
can be very good because a lot of

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.160 
can be very good because a lot of
computer<00:00:50.850> stop<00:00:51.090> motion<00:00:51.390> capture<00:00:51.780> programs

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
which makes steady movements and things

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.069 
which makes steady movements and things

things<00:01:02.760> I<00:01:03.719> often<00:01:04.199> ceiling<00:01:05.129> lights<00:01:05.339> can<00:01:05.640> do

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
things I often ceiling lights can do
