I<00:00:57.780> heard<00:00:58.739> that<00:00:58.890> C++<00:00:59.699> has<00:00:59.730> a<00:00:59.969> lot<00:01:00.270> more

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
I heard that C++ has a lot more

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:02.450 
I heard that C++ has a lot more
functionality<00:01:01.050> but<00:01:01.800> that<00:01:01.980> is<00:01:02.100> only<00:01:02.309> because

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
functionality but that is only because

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.170 
functionality but that is only because
it<00:01:02.940> has<00:01:03.120> been<00:01:03.329> around<00:01:03.600> for<00:01:03.899> 30<00:01:04.170> or<00:01:04.409> so<00:01:04.710> years

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:05.180 
it has been around for 30 or so years

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.690 
it has been around for 30 or so years
Java<00:01:06.180> has<00:01:06.390> better<00:01:06.659> libraries<00:01:07.369> that's<00:01:08.369> one

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:08.700 
Java has better libraries that's one

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:10.580 
Java has better libraries that's one
reason<00:01:08.970> why<00:01:09.330> it<00:01:09.390> is<00:01:09.720> popular<00:01:09.990> with<00:01:10.439> new

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
reason why it is popular with new

programmers<00:01:11.270> they<00:01:12.270> can<00:01:12.450> easily<00:01:12.659> rely<00:01:13.200> on

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
programmers they can easily rely on

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.710

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
libraries to find code modules instead

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.410 
libraries to find code modules instead
of<00:01:15.840> having<00:01:16.110> to<00:01:16.380> write<00:01:16.560> their<00:01:16.860> own<00:01:16.979> and<00:01:17.299> Java<00:01:18.299> is

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
of having to write their own and Java is

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.420 
of having to write their own and Java is
good<00:01:18.780> for<00:01:19.020> embedding<00:01:19.439> scripts<00:01:19.830> in<00:01:19.979> a<00:01:20.070> larger

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
good for embedding scripts in a larger

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.499 
good for embedding scripts in a larger
application<00:01:21.290> yeah<00:01:22.290> using<00:01:22.970> C++<00:01:23.970> to<00:01:24.150> control

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
application yeah using C++ to control

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:27.590 
application yeah using C++ to control
the<00:01:24.630> hardware<00:01:25.220> some<00:01:26.220> of<00:01:26.369> the<00:01:26.490> top<00:01:26.729> 3d<00:01:27.299> games

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
the hardware some of the top 3d games

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.190 
the hardware some of the top 3d games
are<00:01:27.869> written<00:01:28.110> in<00:01:28.229> C++<00:01:29.070> because<00:01:29.390> C++<00:01:30.390> is<00:01:30.630> faster

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
are written in C++ because C++ is faster

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.929 
are written in C++ because C++ is faster
than<00:01:31.380> Java<00:01:31.740> and<00:01:32.040> is<00:01:32.159> the<00:01:32.310> only<00:01:32.460> way<00:01:32.790> the

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
than Java and is the only way the

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:34.580 
than Java and is the only way the
graphics<00:01:33.390> can<00:01:33.659> keep<00:01:33.900> up<00:01:34.049> with<00:01:34.259> the<00:01:34.380> game

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
graphics can keep up with the game

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:38.179 
graphics can keep up with the game
player<00:01:35.090> so<00:01:36.090> what<00:01:36.329> do<00:01:36.450> I<00:01:36.509> do<00:01:36.770> learn<00:01:37.770> Java

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
player so what do I do learn Java

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:40.130 
player so what do I do learn Java
because<00:01:38.490> it<00:01:38.790> is<00:01:38.909> easier<00:01:39.360> and<00:01:39.390> can<00:01:39.780> get<00:01:39.990> you

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
because it is easier and can get you

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.760 
because it is easier and can get you
into<00:01:40.350> coding<00:01:40.860> learn<00:01:41.820> C++<00:01:42.360> over<00:01:43.140> time<00:01:43.380> to<00:01:43.590> get

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:43.770 
into coding learn C++ over time to get

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.999 
into coding learn C++ over time to get
better<00:01:43.950> game<00:01:44.250> performance<00:01:44.700> end<00:01:45.119> eventually

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:46.009 
better game performance end eventually

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:49.280 
better game performance end eventually
