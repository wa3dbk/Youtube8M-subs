00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.210 
about container gardening water in
containers<00:00:06.810> is<00:00:07.020> always<00:00:07.410> an<00:00:07.529> important<00:00:08.010> thing

containers is always an important thing
to<00:00:08.400> think<00:00:08.429> about<00:00:08.730> if<00:00:09.150> you've<00:00:10.080> done<00:00:10.590> a<00:00:10.620> good<00:00:10.800> job

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:10.860 
to think about if you've done a good job

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.249 
to think about if you've done a good job
of<00:00:11.070> constructing<00:00:11.790> your<00:00:11.820> soil<00:00:12.269> it's<00:00:12.990> going<00:00:13.200> to

00:00:13.249 --> 00:00:13.259 
of constructing your soil it's going to

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:15.289 
of constructing your soil it's going to
already<00:00:13.530> hold<00:00:13.860> a<00:00:13.980> lot<00:00:14.160> of<00:00:14.280> moisture<00:00:14.400> things

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:15.299 
already hold a lot of moisture things

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.140 
already hold a lot of moisture things
like<00:00:15.509> Pete<00:00:15.839> things<00:00:16.740> like<00:00:17.010> humise<00:00:17.670> are<00:00:17.880> going

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:18.150 
like Pete things like humise are going

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.240 
like Pete things like humise are going
to<00:00:18.240> hold<00:00:18.449> water<00:00:18.690> in<00:00:18.810> the<00:00:19.020> container<00:00:19.199> and<00:00:19.770> make

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.250 
to hold water in the container and make

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.950 
to hold water in the container and make
it<00:00:20.369> available<00:00:20.460> to<00:00:20.880> your<00:00:20.939> plants<00:00:21.330> on<00:00:21.449> a<00:00:21.480> regular

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
down and get them into a nice

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.249 
down and get them into a nice
temperature<00:01:13.770> where<00:01:13.950> they<00:01:14.070> can<00:01:14.220> grow<00:01:14.460> happily

00:01:15.249 --> 00:01:15.259 
temperature where they can grow happily

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:18.830 
temperature where they can grow happily
now<00:01:16.259> remember<00:01:16.820> smaller<00:01:17.820> the<00:01:18.119> plant<00:01:18.390> and<00:01:18.630> the

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
now remember smaller the plant and the

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:22.100 
now remember smaller the plant and the
smaller<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:19.350> container<00:01:20.689> the<00:01:21.689> quicker<00:01:21.990> that

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:22.110 
smaller the container the quicker that

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:24.350 
smaller the container the quicker that
that<00:01:22.619> plant<00:01:23.250> is<00:01:23.369> going<00:01:23.610> to<00:01:23.670> use<00:01:23.970> the<00:01:24.210> available

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
that plant is going to use the available

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.109 
that plant is going to use the available
water<00:01:24.810> in<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.140> container<00:01:25.460> so<00:01:26.460> your<00:01:26.670> small<00:01:26.790> and

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119 
water in the container so your small and

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.609 
water in the container so your small and
containers<00:01:27.540> are<00:01:27.659> probably<00:01:27.990> going<00:01:28.170> to<00:01:28.259> need<00:01:28.290> a

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:28.619 
containers are probably going to need a

00:01:28.619 --> 00:01:30.260 
containers are probably going to need a
little<00:01:29.130> more<00:01:29.340> water<00:01:29.640> than<00:01:29.880> some<00:01:30.090> of<00:01:30.180> your

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
little more water than some of your

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.770 
little more water than some of your
other<00:01:30.299> ones<00:01:31.430> shallow<00:01:32.430> containers<00:01:33.210> like<00:01:33.600> on

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780 
other ones shallow containers like on

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.200 
other ones shallow containers like on
this<00:01:33.960> bonsai<00:01:34.500> also<00:01:35.189> dry<00:01:35.430> out<00:01:35.610> a<00:01:35.640> lot<00:01:35.909> quicker

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.210 
this bonsai also dry out a lot quicker

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.300 
this bonsai also dry out a lot quicker
so<00:01:36.960> that's<00:01:37.110> another<00:01:37.380> one<00:01:37.590> to<00:01:37.680> consider<00:01:38.070> and

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
so that's another one to consider and

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:41.300 
so that's another one to consider and
real<00:01:39.270> thirsty<00:01:39.780> plants<00:01:40.079> like<00:01:40.619> this<00:01:40.799> banyan

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
real thirsty plants like this banyan

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.429 
real thirsty plants like this banyan
tree<00:01:41.579> I<00:01:41.820> actually<00:01:42.540> keep<00:01:42.930> a<00:01:43.049> container

00:01:43.429 --> 00:01:43.439 
tree I actually keep a container

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:45.710 
tree I actually keep a container
underneath<00:01:43.860> it<00:01:44.220> to<00:01:44.490> catch<00:01:44.729> water<00:01:45.060> it'll

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
underneath it to catch water it'll

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.660 
underneath it to catch water it'll
actually<00:01:46.049> suck<00:01:46.530> water<00:01:46.770> right<00:01:47.070> up<00:01:47.220> out<00:01:47.369> of<00:01:47.399> that

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:47.670 
actually suck water right up out of that

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:53.149 
actually suck water right up out of that
