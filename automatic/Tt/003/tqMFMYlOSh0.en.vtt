00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:19.800 
a long lasting where I don't believe

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.310 
a long lasting where I don't believe
that's<00:00:20.039> true<00:00:20.279> it's<00:00:20.730> totally<00:00:21.570> not<00:00:21.750> eight<00:00:21.990> hours

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
that's true it's totally not eight hours

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.330 
that's true it's totally not eight hours
more<00:00:22.769> like<00:00:22.980> one<00:00:23.670> hour<00:00:23.880> or<00:00:24.060> two<00:00:24.240> hours<00:00:24.480> and<00:00:25.340> if

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
more like one hour or two hours and if

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:27.980 
more like one hour or two hours and if
you<00:00:26.460> want<00:00:26.670> it<00:00:26.760> to<00:00:26.910> like<00:00:27.090> last<00:00:27.420> a<00:00:27.660> really<00:00:27.840> long

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
you want it to like last a really long

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.259 
you want it to like last a really long
time<00:00:28.410> you<00:00:28.650> should<00:00:28.859> wear<00:00:29.099> a<00:00:29.130> lip<00:00:29.429> liner<00:00:29.670> under

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
time you should wear a lip liner under

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:32.959 
time you should wear a lip liner under
it<00:00:30.390> because<00:00:30.750> that<00:00:31.080> would<00:00:31.949> keep<00:00:32.430> the<00:00:32.610> coloring

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
it because that would keep the coloring

the<00:02:35.240> lipstick<00:02:35.600> alone<00:02:35.870> doesn't<00:02:36.080> work<00:02:36.290> by

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:36.440 
the lipstick alone doesn't work by

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.680 
the lipstick alone doesn't work by
itself<00:02:36.650> because<00:02:36.980> it<00:02:37.190> just<00:02:37.760> starts<00:02:38.450> fading

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
itself because it just starts fading

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:43.990 
itself because it just starts fading
away<00:02:38.959> and<00:02:39.560> if<00:02:39.680> you<00:02:39.769> eat<00:02:39.980> like<00:02:40.730> me<00:02:40.970> and<00:02:42.790> talk<00:02:43.790> on

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:44.000 
away and if you eat like me and talk on

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.170 
away and if you eat like me and talk on
it<00:02:44.420> starts<00:02:45.190> doing<00:02:46.190> some<00:02:46.430> crazy<00:02:46.610> things<00:02:47.030> you

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:47.180 
it starts doing some crazy things you

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:48.729 
it starts doing some crazy things you
don't<00:02:47.330> want<00:02:47.390> it<00:02:47.570> to<00:02:47.660> do<00:02:47.750> so<00:02:47.959> where's<00:02:48.320> some<00:02:48.530> lip

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:48.739 
don't want it to do so where's some lip

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:51.479 
don't want it to do so where's some lip
liner<00:02:48.950> within<00:02:49.489> then<00:02:49.670> I<00:02:49.760> last<00:02:50.060> a<00:02:50.300> lot<00:02:50.690> longer

liner within then I last a lot longer

00:02:51.489 --> 00:02:54.070 
liner within then I last a lot longer
