 a new video tutorial 

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:11.680
 this time we will show how to leave 

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:15.650

 The first thing we need friends is 

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.740
 two very important super applications 

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:24.289
 that we will find for free in 

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:26.539
 the place thor the first one is called Czech 

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:29.810
 in the second supersur as you can see 

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:31.610
 I'm a super user I'm a root user and 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:33.830

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:36.559

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:39.620
 We are not road users and how can we 

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:41.300

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:43.040

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.390

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:08.369
 recovery we give normal spirit of 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:10.570
 remember he feeds him and then we give him 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:12.520
 another application has been detected that 

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:14.800
 superuser band then we 

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:18.540
 we give cancel and there's the 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.540
 installation is complete of supersur 

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:25.300

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:27.430
 record and we come up to adjustments 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:29.790

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:32.110

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:35.130

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.229

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.140
 process left satisfactorily 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.380
 real will be lost and the application will 

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:54.500

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:02.810
 it might be a little time and 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:05.690

 root and I will show you 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:18.030
 so you can see, we are no longer a user 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:19.920
 root is already defeated on his cell phone and 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:22.020
