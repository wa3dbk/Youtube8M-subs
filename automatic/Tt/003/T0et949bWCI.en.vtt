square or 8 inches we have a range of
colors<00:00:25.910> and<00:00:26.090> patterns<00:00:27.880> and<00:00:28.880> we<00:00:29.329> might<00:00:29.509> kick

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:29.750 
colors and patterns and we might kick

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:37.920 
colors and patterns and we might kick
something<00:00:30.050> with<00:00:31.270> a<00:00:32.270> bit<00:00:32.450> of<00:00:32.480> time<00:00:35.530> we<00:00:36.530> start

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:37.930 
something with a bit of time we start

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:46.030 
something with a bit of time we start
with<00:00:38.930> a<00:00:38.960> white<00:00:40.270> triangle<00:00:44.500> with<00:00:45.500> nice<00:00:45.770> and

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:46.040 
with a white triangle with nice and

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:52.210 
with a white triangle with nice and
sharp<00:00:46.310> creases<00:00:46.610> one<00:00:47.390> way<00:00:47.600> and<00:00:48.610> then<00:00:49.610> the<00:00:51.220> other

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:52.220 
sharp creases one way and then the other

00:00:52.220 --> 00:01:01.560 
sharp creases one way and then the other
way<00:00:58.390> after<00:00:59.390> which<00:00:59.570> we<00:00:59.960> loosen<00:01:00.290> it<00:01:00.410> out<00:01:00.560> and

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:01.570 
way after which we loosen it out and

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:08.310 
way after which we loosen it out and
then<00:01:02.570> do<00:01:02.750> the<00:01:03.079> book<00:01:03.260> fold<00:01:03.530> in<00:01:04.250> one<00:01:04.549> direction

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:08.320 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:19.360 

and<00:01:09.880> then<00:01:10.880> the<00:01:11.690> other<00:01:11.720> direction<00:01:18.220> that<00:01:19.220> will

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:19.370 
and then the other direction that will

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:25.180 
and then the other direction that will
then<00:01:19.549> give<00:01:19.820> us<00:01:21.040> the<00:01:22.040> bloom<00:01:22.659> or<00:01:23.920> the<00:01:24.920> flower

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:25.190 
then give us the bloom or the flower

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:28.390 
then give us the bloom or the flower
it's<00:01:25.790> actually<00:01:26.240> the<00:01:26.479> preliminary<00:01:27.110> fold<00:01:27.470> but

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:28.400 
it's actually the preliminary fold but

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:36.940 
it's actually the preliminary fold but
it<00:01:28.549> could<00:01:28.820> be<00:01:29.620> the<00:01:30.620> flower<00:01:31.960> of<00:01:32.960> a<00:01:34.060> vine<00:01:35.950> that's

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:36.950 
it could be the flower of a vine that's

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:38.910 
it could be the flower of a vine that's
been<00:01:37.190> grown<00:01:37.460> in<00:01:37.670> Papua<00:01:38.090> New<00:01:38.119> Guinea

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:38.920 
been grown in Papua New Guinea

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.310 
been grown in Papua New Guinea
cultivated<00:01:39.920> over<00:01:40.010> time<00:01:40.690> from<00:01:41.690> an<00:01:41.840> orchid

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 
cultivated over time from an orchid

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.630 
cultivated over time from an orchid
until<00:01:43.130> it<00:01:43.400> produces<00:01:44.060> a<00:01:44.770> bean<00:01:45.770> with<00:01:46.070> an<00:01:46.190> essence

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 
until it produces a bean with an essence

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.410 
until it produces a bean with an essence
and<00:01:46.970> that<00:01:47.930> would<00:01:48.080> be<00:01:48.130> vanilla<00:01:49.130> now<00:01:49.880> to<00:01:49.939> check

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
and that would be vanilla now to check

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.250 
and that would be vanilla now to check
if<00:01:50.689> the<00:01:51.409> vanilla<00:01:51.710> is<00:01:51.890> ready<00:01:52.100> for<00:01:52.280> harvesting

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:53.260 
if the vanilla is ready for harvesting

00:01:53.260 --> 00:02:01.429 
if the vanilla is ready for harvesting
we<00:01:54.260> peel<00:01:54.710> open<00:01:56.500> one<00:01:57.500> of<00:01:57.619> the<00:01:57.740> petals

00:02:01.429 --> 00:02:01.439 

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:07.560 

and<00:02:02.670> get<00:02:03.670> the<00:02:03.880> petal<00:02:04.240> on<00:02:04.390> the<00:02:04.539> other<00:02:04.659> side<00:02:06.570> to

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:07.570 
and get the petal on the other side to

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:13.110 
and get the petal on the other side to
see<00:02:09.869> here<00:02:10.869> there's<00:02:11.110> a<00:02:11.200> nice<00:02:11.410> fragrance<00:02:12.120> if

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
see here there's a nice fragrance if

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.500 
see here there's a nice fragrance if
there<00:02:13.840> isn't<00:02:14.140> a<00:02:14.200> nice<00:02:14.379> fragrance<00:02:15.209> means<00:02:16.209> it's

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
there isn't a nice fragrance means it's

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.990 
there isn't a nice fragrance means it's
not<00:02:16.720> ready<00:02:16.959> so<00:02:17.800> we<00:02:17.920> close<00:02:18.220> the<00:02:18.370> petals<00:02:18.790> back

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
not ready so we close the petals back

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.540 
not ready so we close the petals back
and<00:02:20.310> let<00:02:21.310> nature<00:02:21.550> takes<00:02:22.030> its<00:02:22.120> course<00:02:23.550> which

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:24.550 
and let nature takes its course which

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:27.830 
and let nature takes its course which
means<00:02:24.849> that<00:02:25.180> the<00:02:25.660> petal<00:02:26.050> will<00:02:26.200> open<00:02:26.530> by<00:02:26.709> itself

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
means that the petal will open by itself

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:33.870 
means that the petal will open by itself
to<00:02:28.840> the<00:02:28.989> center<00:02:29.470> and<00:02:30.430> then<00:02:32.280> to<00:02:33.280> the<00:02:33.400> center

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880 
to the center and then to the center

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:40.199 
to the center and then to the center
again<00:02:35.340> and<00:02:36.340> then<00:02:36.970> you<00:02:37.120> will<00:02:37.299> flip<00:02:37.510> over<00:02:39.209> we

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.209 
again and then you will flip over we

00:02:40.209 --> 00:02:43.740 
again and then you will flip over we
repeat<00:02:40.540> that<00:02:40.780> on<00:02:40.989> the<00:02:41.079> other<00:02:41.739> side<00:02:42.630> to<00:02:43.630> this

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:43.750 
repeat that on the other side to this

00:02:43.750 --> 00:03:00.030 
repeat that on the other side to this
point<00:02:44.670> here<00:02:49.410> again<00:02:58.349> now<00:02:59.349> that<00:02:59.620> the<00:02:59.739> vanilla

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
point here again now that the vanilla

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.280 
point here again now that the vanilla
has<00:03:00.220> been<00:03:00.400> harvested<00:03:00.970> and<00:03:01.150> dried<00:03:01.209> they<00:03:02.019> can

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
has been harvested and dried they can

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:07.819 
has been harvested and dried they can
then<00:03:02.319> be<00:03:02.650> loaded<00:03:03.209> onto<00:03:04.209> a<00:03:04.510> ship<00:03:04.630> to<00:03:05.790> set<00:03:06.790> sail

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:07.829 
then be loaded onto a ship to set sail

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:12.360 
then be loaded onto a ship to set sail
down<00:03:08.829> the<00:03:09.069> east<00:03:09.310> coast<00:03:09.459> of<00:03:09.940> Australia<00:03:11.370> until

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
down the east coast of Australia until

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:16.140 
down the east coast of Australia until
it<00:03:12.489> comes<00:03:12.760> up<00:03:12.940> to<00:03:13.319> bundaberg<00:03:14.730> where<00:03:15.730> it<00:03:15.970> picks

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
it comes up to bundaberg where it picks

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:22.349 
it comes up to bundaberg where it picks
up<00:03:17.130> sugar<00:03:18.239> as<00:03:19.239> well<00:03:19.299> as<00:03:20.260> milk<00:03:20.590> and<00:03:21.430> of<00:03:22.060> course

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:22.359 
up sugar as well as milk and of course

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:25.080 
up sugar as well as milk and of course
as<00:03:22.630> it's<00:03:22.810> coming<00:03:23.019> down<00:03:23.319> the<00:03:23.470> East<00:03:23.620> Coast<00:03:24.090> it

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:25.090 
as it's coming down the East Coast it

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:29.699 
as it's coming down the East Coast it
then<00:03:25.329> hits<00:03:25.569> a<00:03:25.780> storm<00:03:26.579> and<00:03:27.720> it<00:03:28.720> transforms<00:03:29.530> the

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:29.709 
then hits a storm and it transforms the

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:32.849 
then hits a storm and it transforms the
boat<00:03:30.389> so<00:03:31.389> that<00:03:31.420> the<00:03:31.750> fan<00:03:32.019> opens<00:03:32.560> up<00:03:32.650> completely

00:03:32.849 --> 00:03:32.859 
boat so that the fan opens up completely

00:03:32.859 --> 00:03:40.250 
boat so that the fan opens up completely
and<00:03:35.430> the<00:03:36.430> back<00:03:36.700> also<00:03:37.299> opens<00:03:37.870> up<00:03:37.989> completely<00:03:38.200> so

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.260 
and the back also opens up completely so

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:42.840 
and the back also opens up completely so
now<00:03:41.260> this<00:03:41.440> boat<00:03:41.680> has<00:03:41.829> been<00:03:41.859> transformed<00:03:42.639> into

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:42.850 
now this boat has been transformed into

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:47.970 
now this boat has been transformed into
a<00:03:43.720> diamond<00:03:44.049> shape<00:03:44.549> and<00:03:45.989> that<00:03:46.989> also<00:03:47.170> transforms

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
a diamond shape and that also transforms

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:51.449 
a diamond shape and that also transforms
the<00:03:48.190> car<00:03:48.459> door<00:03:48.900> which<00:03:49.900> now<00:03:50.109> becomes<00:03:50.530> a<00:03:50.889> very

00:03:51.449 --> 00:03:51.459 
the car door which now becomes a very

00:03:51.459 --> 00:03:54.569 
the car door which now becomes a very
special<00:03:52.329> ice<00:03:52.510> cream<00:03:53.010> to<00:03:54.010> know<00:03:54.160> what<00:03:54.340> kind<00:03:54.489> of

00:03:54.569 --> 00:03:54.579 
special ice cream to know what kind of

00:03:54.579 --> 00:03:57.740 
special ice cream to know what kind of
ice<00:03:54.880> cream<00:03:55.090> you<00:03:55.329> get<00:03:55.859> we<00:03:56.859> now<00:03:56.980> have<00:03:57.010> to<00:03:57.310> fall

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750 
ice cream you get we now have to fall

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:01.259 
ice cream you get we now have to fall
these<00:03:58.750> two<00:03:58.989> points<00:03:59.260> sharp<00:03:59.680> and<00:04:00.040> have<00:04:01.000> the<00:04:01.090> ice

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:01.269 
these two points sharp and have the ice

00:04:01.269 --> 00:04:04.170 
these two points sharp and have the ice
cream<00:04:01.569> at<00:04:01.989> this<00:04:02.290> end<00:04:02.560> so<00:04:03.549> we<00:04:03.700> now<00:04:03.849> make<00:04:04.000> the

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:04.180 
cream at this end so we now make the

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:08.910 
cream at this end so we now make the
cone<00:04:05.819> at<00:04:06.819> the<00:04:06.880> two<00:04:07.269> sharp<00:04:07.599> points

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:08.920 
cone at the two sharp points

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:15.690 
cone at the two sharp points
here<00:04:11.340> and<00:04:12.340> here<00:04:12.670> and<00:04:13.890> we<00:04:14.890> keep<00:04:15.130> on<00:04:15.340> the<00:04:15.580> other

00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:15.700 
here and here and we keep on the other

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:25.590 
here and here and we keep on the other
side<00:04:16.290> here<00:04:19.889> and<00:04:21.720> here<00:04:22.720> and<00:04:24.060> we<00:04:25.060> do<00:04:25.210> one<00:04:25.419> more

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:25.600 
side here and here and we do one more

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.350 
side here and here and we do one more
transformation<00:04:26.410> by<00:04:27.370> trapping<00:04:27.790> these<00:04:28.150> two

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:28.360 
transformation by trapping these two

00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:32.520 
transformation by trapping these two
together<00:04:28.570> and<00:04:29.520> do<00:04:30.520> the<00:04:30.669> same<00:04:30.940> on<00:04:31.150> this<00:04:31.600> end<00:04:31.870> so

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:32.530 
together and do the same on this end so

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:38.220 
together and do the same on this end so
that<00:04:32.680> we<00:04:32.830> now<00:04:33.010> have<00:04:36.090> double<00:04:37.090> cones<00:04:37.419> with<00:04:38.110> the

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:38.230 
that we now have double cones with the

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:46.170 
that we now have double cones with the
ice<00:04:38.410> cream<00:04:38.740> on<00:04:38.980> top<00:04:44.580> this<00:04:45.580> is<00:04:45.729> now<00:04:45.910> very

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.180 
ice cream on top this is now very

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:49.500 
ice cream on top this is now very
special<00:04:46.720> ice<00:04:46.930> cream<00:04:47.260> because<00:04:48.150> if<00:04:49.150> you<00:04:49.300> eat

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:49.510 
special ice cream because if you eat

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:52.820 
special ice cream because if you eat
this<00:04:49.660> ice<00:04:49.900> cream<00:04:50.200> it<00:04:50.770> doesn't<00:04:51.100> just<00:04:51.160> finish

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:52.830 
this ice cream it doesn't just finish

00:04:52.830 --> 00:05:02.960 
this ice cream it doesn't just finish
like<00:04:53.830> when<00:04:54.400> you<00:04:54.490> take<00:04:54.669> it<00:04:54.820> off<00:04:54.910> here<00:04:57.419> and<00:04:58.419> here

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:02.970 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:07.650 

the<00:05:03.970> part<00:05:04.240> of<00:05:04.330> ice<00:05:04.540> cream<00:05:04.780> goes<00:05:04.990> away<00:05:05.250> but<00:05:06.660> it

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:07.660 
the part of ice cream goes away but it

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:11.360 
the part of ice cream goes away but it
doesn't<00:05:08.080> disappear<00:05:08.560> because<00:05:09.340> your<00:05:10.000> trap<00:05:10.270> it

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:11.370 
doesn't disappear because your trap it

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:16.529 
doesn't disappear because your trap it
between<00:05:12.370> the<00:05:12.520> two<00:05:12.729> cones<00:05:15.030> this<00:05:16.030> ice<00:05:16.240> cream

00:05:16.529 --> 00:05:16.539 
between the two cones this ice cream

00:05:16.539 --> 00:05:21.630 
between the two cones this ice cream
will<00:05:17.289> come<00:05:17.500> back<00:05:18.720> it<00:05:19.720> is<00:05:19.870> ice<00:05:20.169> cream<00:05:20.640> that

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:21.640 
will come back it is ice cream that

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:24.409 
will come back it is ice cream that
never<00:05:21.910> runs<00:05:22.240> out<00:05:22.450> so<00:05:23.110> you<00:05:23.169> take<00:05:23.500> that<00:05:23.650> away<00:05:23.710> and

00:05:24.409 --> 00:05:24.419 
never runs out so you take that away and

00:05:24.419 --> 00:05:28.800 
never runs out so you take that away and
trap<00:05:25.419> it<00:05:25.450> again<00:05:25.840> between<00:05:26.470> the<00:05:26.590> two<00:05:26.770> cones<00:05:27.810> up

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:28.810 
trap it again between the two cones up

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:31.860 
trap it again between the two cones up
to<00:05:29.020> there<00:05:29.260> and<00:05:30.030> as<00:05:31.030> you<00:05:31.180> slide<00:05:31.450> those<00:05:31.720> two

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:31.870 
to there and as you slide those two

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:34.469 
to there and as you slide those two
edges<00:05:32.340> the<00:05:33.340> ice<00:05:33.490> cream<00:05:33.789> must<00:05:33.970> climb<00:05:34.180> right

00:05:34.469 --> 00:05:34.479 
edges the ice cream must climb right

00:05:34.479 --> 00:05:38.180 
edges the ice cream must climb right
back<00:05:34.539> up<00:05:35.340> to<00:05:36.340> the<00:05:36.370> top<00:05:36.550> of<00:05:36.970> the<00:05:37.060> code<00:05:37.630> and<00:05:37.840> that

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:38.190 
back up to the top of the code and that

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:41.460 
back up to the top of the code and that
is<00:05:39.190> the<00:05:39.700> crawling<00:05:40.030> beetle<00:05:40.330> or<00:05:40.690> the<00:05:41.200> never

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:41.470 
is the crawling beetle or the never

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:44.820 
is the crawling beetle or the never
