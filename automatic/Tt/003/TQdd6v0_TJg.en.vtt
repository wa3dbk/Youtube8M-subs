00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.500 
while but then I thought when you look

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:52.719 
while but then I thought when you look
at<00:01:51.649> that<00:01:51.709> stretch<00:01:52.009> to<00:01:52.220> the<00:01:52.340> end<00:01:52.429> of<00:01:52.520> the<00:01:52.580> first

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:52.729 
at that stretch to the end of the first

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:54.699 
at that stretch to the end of the first
happened<00:01:53.179> came<00:01:53.360> out<00:01:53.539> early<00:01:54.229> it<00:01:54.410> was<00:01:54.500> good

00:01:54.699 --> 00:01:54.709 
happened came out early it was good

00:01:54.709 --> 00:01:56.080 
happened came out early it was good
confidence<00:01:55.190> building<00:01:55.459> for<00:01:55.610> him<00:01:55.729> to<00:01:55.819> hit<00:01:55.940> those

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:56.090 
confidence building for him to hit those

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:57.430 
confidence building for him to hit those
outside<00:01:56.479> shots<00:01:56.780> wasn't<00:01:57.110> it<00:01:57.170> yeah<00:01:57.289> it<00:01:57.349> really

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:57.440 
outside shots wasn't it yeah it really

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.160 
outside shots wasn't it yeah it really
was<00:01:57.560> he<00:01:58.340> was<00:01:58.459> good<00:01:58.610> for<00:01:58.759> him<00:01:58.970> and<00:01:59.209> you<00:01:59.959> know<00:02:00.050> we

he<00:04:25.050> really<00:04:25.140> improved<00:04:25.590> off<00:04:25.770> the<00:04:25.950> start<00:04:26.160> of<00:04:26.250> the

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:26.310 
he really improved off the start of the

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:27.980 
he really improved off the start of the
season<00:04:26.490> so<00:04:27.000> now<00:04:27.150> you're<00:04:27.390> comfortable<00:04:27.810> putting

00:04:27.980 --> 00:04:27.990 
season so now you're comfortable putting

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:29.360 
season so now you're comfortable putting
him<00:04:28.200> above<00:04:28.500> the<00:04:28.530> ball<00:04:28.830> game<00:04:29.010> at<00:04:29.100> any<00:04:29.160> moment

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 
him above the ball game at any moment

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:30.740 
him above the ball game at any moment
well<00:04:29.669> I<00:04:29.700> think<00:04:29.850> he's<00:04:30.060> got<00:04:30.180> a<00:04:30.240> good<00:04:30.390> comfort

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:30.750 
well I think he's got a good comfort

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:32.029 
well I think he's got a good comfort
level<00:04:31.020> defensively<00:04:31.470> what<00:04:31.650> we're<00:04:31.770> trying<00:04:31.919> to

00:04:32.029 --> 00:04:32.039 
level defensively what we're trying to

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:34.310 
level defensively what we're trying to
do<00:04:32.220> I<00:04:32.400> mean<00:04:32.550> he<00:04:32.669> can<00:04:32.789> physically<00:04:33.210> compete<00:04:33.600> he's

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:34.320 
do I mean he can physically compete he's

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:35.719 
do I mean he can physically compete he's
a<00:04:34.350> very<00:04:34.560> good<00:04:34.740> rebounder

00:04:35.719 --> 00:04:35.729 
a very good rebounder

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:37.279 
a very good rebounder
and<00:04:36.180> obviously<00:04:36.419> offense<00:04:36.870> well<00:04:37.020> he's<00:04:37.139> got<00:04:37.259> a

00:04:37.279 --> 00:04:37.289 
and obviously offense well he's got a

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:38.629 
and obviously offense well he's got a
very<00:04:37.349> good<00:04:37.589> skill<00:04:37.860> level<00:04:38.159> he<00:04:38.219> can<00:04:38.339> step<00:04:38.520> out

00:04:38.629 --> 00:04:38.639 
very good skill level he can step out

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:39.920 
very good skill level he can step out
and<00:04:38.729> shoot<00:04:38.909> the<00:04:38.999> basketball<00:04:39.449> I<00:04:39.569> think<00:04:39.839> he

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:39.930 
and shoot the basketball I think he

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:41.779 
and shoot the basketball I think he
understands<00:04:40.319> what's<00:04:40.559> a<00:04:40.650> good<00:04:40.770> shot<00:04:41.069> and<00:04:41.339> any

00:04:41.779 --> 00:04:41.789 
understands what's a good shot and any

00:04:41.789 --> 00:04:43.700 
understands what's a good shot and any
place<00:04:41.969> was<00:04:42.210> great<00:04:42.300> toughness<00:04:42.659> and<00:04:43.110> I<00:04:43.169> think

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:43.710 
place was great toughness and I think

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:44.629 
place was great toughness and I think
that's<00:04:43.860> the<00:04:43.949> biggest<00:04:44.129> thing<00:04:44.279> is<00:04:44.490> he's

00:04:44.629 --> 00:04:44.639 
that's the biggest thing is he's

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:47.480 
that's the biggest thing is he's
physically<00:04:45.379> he's<00:04:46.379> adjusted<00:04:46.949> to<00:04:47.099> the<00:04:47.219> speed<00:04:47.460> of

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:47.490 
physically he's adjusted to the speed of

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:49.429 
physically he's adjusted to the speed of
the<00:04:47.639> game<00:04:47.699> as<00:04:48.089> well<00:04:48.270> in<00:04:48.749> practice<00:04:49.050> has<00:04:49.409> been

00:04:49.429 --> 00:04:49.439 
the game as well in practice has been

00:04:49.439 --> 00:04:51.079 
the game as well in practice has been
great<00:04:49.770> for<00:04:49.949> him<00:04:50.159> and<00:04:50.400> he's<00:04:50.699> starting<00:04:50.819> to<00:04:50.969> get

00:04:51.079 --> 00:04:51.089 
great for him and he's starting to get

00:04:51.089 --> 00:04:53.629 
great for him and he's starting to get
confidence<00:04:51.629> and<00:04:51.960> with<00:04:52.589> that<00:04:52.770> obviously<00:04:53.400> gives

00:04:53.629 --> 00:04:53.639 
confidence and with that obviously gives
