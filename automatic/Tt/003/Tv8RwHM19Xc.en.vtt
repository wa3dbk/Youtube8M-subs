vessels they changed form they got
bigger<00:02:09.929> they<00:02:10.200> got<00:02:10.319> smaller

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:15.550 

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.630 

and<00:02:15.760> then<00:02:16.480> I<00:02:16.510> move<00:02:16.840> from<00:02:17.590> that<00:02:17.920> to<00:02:18.250> this<00:02:18.370> other

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
and then I move from that to this other

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.720 
and then I move from that to this other
figurative<00:02:19.600> form<00:02:19.930> also<00:02:20.470> sculpting<00:02:21.460> them<00:02:21.610> in

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
figurative form also sculpting them in

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.800 
figurative form also sculpting them in
clay<00:02:22.320> also<00:02:23.320> painting<00:02:23.950> on<00:02:24.100> the<00:02:24.250> surface<00:02:24.810> then

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:25.810 
clay also painting on the surface then

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.990 
clay also painting on the surface then
the<00:02:26.110> painting<00:02:26.560> became<00:02:27.010> something<00:02:27.340> of<00:02:27.580> its<00:02:27.790> own

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
the painting became something of its own

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.910 
the painting became something of its own
and<00:02:28.330> so<00:02:28.450> it<00:02:28.540> moved<00:02:28.750> off<00:02:28.960> the<00:02:28.990> clay<00:02:29.500> and<00:02:29.710> I<00:02:29.770> was

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:29.920 
and so it moved off the clay and I was

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:49.720 
and so it moved off the clay and I was
just<00:02:30.160> doing<00:02:30.460> the<00:02:30.580> paintings

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:49.730 

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.119 

sometimes<00:02:50.730> I'll<00:02:51.629> take<00:02:51.959> a<00:02:51.989> tangent<00:02:52.650> off<00:02:52.799> to<00:02:53.010> the

00:02:53.119 --> 00:02:53.129 
sometimes I'll take a tangent off to the

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:55.640 
sometimes I'll take a tangent off to the
side<00:02:53.370> because<00:02:53.609> I<00:02:53.819> become<00:02:54.420> interested<00:02:54.599> in<00:02:55.079> in<00:02:55.349> a

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:55.650 
side because I become interested in in a

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.360 
side because I become interested in in a
process<00:02:56.420> about<00:02:57.420> seven<00:02:58.079> years<00:02:58.260> ago<00:02:58.620> I<00:02:58.650> saw<00:02:59.069> an

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
process about seven years ago I saw an

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.369

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:01.010 

there<00:03:59.460> was<00:03:59.610> a<00:03:59.640> description<00:04:00.120> of<00:04:00.390> how<00:04:00.540> he<00:04:00.600> did

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:01.020 
there was a description of how he did

00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:04.160 
there was a description of how he did
them<00:04:01.260> using<00:04:01.740> a<00:04:01.980> scanner<00:04:02.460> so<00:04:02.850> I<00:04:03.570> came<00:04:03.720> back<00:04:04.110> and

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.170 
them using a scanner so I came back and

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:05.900 
them using a scanner so I came back and
I<00:04:04.440> had<00:04:04.470> a<00:04:04.620> scanner<00:04:05.010> and<00:04:05.280> I<00:04:05.370> started<00:04:05.730> playing

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:05.910 
I had a scanner and I started playing

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:10.580 
I had a scanner and I started playing
with<00:04:06.120> it<00:04:06.180> I<00:04:07.940> build<00:04:08.940> basically<00:04:09.720> a<00:04:09.870> sculpture<00:04:10.560> of

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
with it I build basically a sculpture of

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:14.060 
with it I build basically a sculpture of
objects<00:04:11.370> that<00:04:11.700> are<00:04:12.030> glued<00:04:12.540> together<00:04:12.810> and<00:04:13.410> then

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:14.070 
objects that are glued together and then

00:04:14.070 --> 00:04:16.310 
objects that are glued together and then
I<00:04:14.100> have<00:04:14.460> a<00:04:14.490> framework<00:04:14.850> over<00:04:15.540> the<00:04:15.690> scanner<00:04:16.019> that

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:16.320 
I have a framework over the scanner that

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.680 
I have a framework over the scanner that
I<00:04:16.380> can<00:04:16.680> hang<00:04:17.010> things<00:04:17.280> from<00:04:17.760> if<00:04:18.120> I<00:04:18.269> need<00:04:18.480> them<00:04:18.630> to

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
I can hang things from if I need them to

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:20.840 
I can hang things from if I need them to
be<00:04:18.870> at<00:04:19.079> different<00:04:19.260> heights<00:04:19.680> again<00:04:19.950> playing

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:20.850 
be at different heights again playing

00:04:20.850 --> 00:04:22.910 
be at different heights again playing
with<00:04:20.970> that<00:04:21.239> space<00:04:21.570> but<00:04:22.170> I've<00:04:22.320> been<00:04:22.590> using

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:22.920 
with that space but I've been using

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:26.270 
with that space but I've been using
light<00:04:23.400> and<00:04:23.700> bouncing<00:04:24.240> light<00:04:24.450> off<00:04:24.660> to<00:04:25.280> suggest

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:26.280 
light and bouncing light off to suggest

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:30.020 
light and bouncing light off to suggest
a<00:04:26.430> deeper<00:04:26.910> space<00:04:27.240> than<00:04:27.720> is<00:04:28.230> actually<00:04:28.470> there<00:04:29.130> to

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:30.030 
a deeper space than is actually there to

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:35.990 
a deeper space than is actually there to
create<00:04:30.390> a<00:04:30.419> mood<00:04:33.530> that<00:04:34.530> was<00:04:34.890> a<00:04:34.919> process<00:04:35.640> that<00:04:35.940> I

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 
create a mood that was a process that I

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.159 
create a mood that was a process that I
saw<00:04:36.600> and<00:04:37.110> was<00:04:37.320> intrigued<00:04:37.830> by<00:04:38.100> and<00:04:38.730> as<00:04:39.720> I

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:40.169 
saw and was intrigued by and as I

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:42.470 
saw and was intrigued by and as I
developed<00:04:40.770> it<00:04:40.950> it<00:04:41.220> then<00:04:41.580> started<00:04:42.120> to<00:04:42.240> talk

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:42.480 
developed it it then started to talk

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:44.180 
developed it it then started to talk
more<00:04:42.810> about<00:04:42.870> these<00:04:43.200> same<00:04:43.500> things<00:04:43.800> that<00:04:44.040> I've

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:44.190 
more about these same things that I've

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:46.130 
more about these same things that I've
been<00:04:44.340> talking<00:04:44.850> about<00:04:44.970> but<00:04:45.270> initially<00:04:45.570> I<00:04:45.900> was

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:46.140 
been talking about but initially I was

00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:51.430 
been talking about but initially I was
attracted<00:04:46.740> to<00:04:46.770> it<00:04:47.040> for<00:04:47.280> the<00:04:47.400> process

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:51.440 

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.740 

and<00:04:52.070> maybe<00:04:52.490> this<00:04:52.700> is<00:04:52.880> the<00:04:53.000> first<00:04:53.240> time<00:04:53.480> that

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:53.750 
and maybe this is the first time that

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:57.190 
and maybe this is the first time that
I'm<00:04:53.900> working<00:04:54.170> on<00:04:54.380> several<00:04:54.850> different<00:04:56.200> things

00:04:57.190 --> 00:04:57.200 
I'm working on several different things

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:00.280 
I'm working on several different things
at<00:04:57.500> once<00:04:57.740> the<00:04:58.580> scans<00:04:59.060> I'm<00:04:59.450> working<00:04:59.840> on<00:05:00.020> that's

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:00.290 
at once the scans I'm working on that's

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:03.760 
at once the scans I'm working on that's
an<00:05:00.560> ongoing<00:05:01.360> series<00:05:02.360> I'm<00:05:02.930> working<00:05:03.530> on<00:05:03.620> the

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:03.770 
an ongoing series I'm working on the

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:06.610 
an ongoing series I'm working on the
paintings<00:05:04.250> that's<00:05:05.060> an<00:05:05.240> ongoing<00:05:05.420> series<00:05:06.050> I'm

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:06.620 
paintings that's an ongoing series I'm

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:09.460 
paintings that's an ongoing series I'm
teaching<00:05:07.430> a<00:05:07.550> course<00:05:07.790> right<00:05:08.240> now<00:05:08.480> in<00:05:08.780> ceramics

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:09.470 
teaching a course right now in ceramics

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:13.690 
teaching a course right now in ceramics
in<00:05:09.740> large-scale<00:05:10.370> sculpture<00:05:11.030> at<00:05:11.770> UMass<00:05:12.770> so

00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:13.700 
in large-scale sculpture at UMass so

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:16.990 
in large-scale sculpture at UMass so
it's<00:05:14.330> sort<00:05:15.020> of<00:05:15.140> getting<00:05:15.470> me<00:05:15.850> thinking<00:05:16.850> I'm

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:17.000 
it's sort of getting me thinking I'm

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.420 
it's sort of getting me thinking I'm
looking<00:05:17.330> at<00:05:17.480> ceramics<00:05:18.020> again<00:05:18.380> and<00:05:18.770> thinking

00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:19.430 
looking at ceramics again and thinking

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:24.550 
looking at ceramics again and thinking
about<00:05:19.930> where<00:05:20.930> I<00:05:20.960> left<00:05:21.350> off<00:05:21.650> with<00:05:21.980> that<00:05:22.160> and<00:05:23.560> is

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:24.560 
about where I left off with that and is

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:26.230 
about where I left off with that and is
there<00:05:24.800> something<00:05:25.160> new<00:05:25.190> I<00:05:25.370> might<00:05:25.700> want<00:05:25.940> to<00:05:26.030> say

00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:26.240 
there something new I might want to say

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:28.180 
there something new I might want to say
with<00:05:26.510> that<00:05:26.540> is<00:05:26.870> there<00:05:27.020> some<00:05:27.290> place<00:05:27.800> I<00:05:28.040> might

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:28.190 
with that is there some place I might

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:32.830 
with that is there some place I might
want<00:05:28.400> to<00:05:28.490> take<00:05:28.730> that<00:05:28.970> work<00:05:29.270> again<00:05:31.420> the<00:05:32.420> issues

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:32.840 
want to take that work again the issues

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:36.130 
want to take that work again the issues
that<00:05:33.050> I<00:05:33.080> examine<00:05:34.070> change<00:05:34.520> as<00:05:34.820> I<00:05:34.940> get<00:05:35.120> older<00:05:35.300> my

00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:36.140 
that I examine change as I get older my

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:39.520 
that I examine change as I get older my
experience<00:05:36.770> changes<00:05:37.340> so<00:05:37.580> I<00:05:37.960> think<00:05:38.960> it<00:05:39.080> bounces

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:39.530 
experience changes so I think it bounces

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:41.740 
experience changes so I think it bounces
back<00:05:39.800> and<00:05:40.160> forth<00:05:40.220> between<00:05:40.700> being<00:05:41.240> personal

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:41.750 
back and forth between being personal

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:44.710 
back and forth between being personal
and<00:05:42.020> being<00:05:42.520> not<00:05:43.520> so<00:05:43.760> personal<00:05:43.970> you<00:05:44.690> know

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:44.720 
and being not so personal you know

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.870 
and being not so personal you know
before<00:05:45.290> it<00:05:45.440> might<00:05:45.620> have<00:05:45.770> been<00:05:45.920> this<00:05:46.070> more<00:05:46.610> of<00:05:46.760> a

00:05:46.870 --> 00:05:46.880 
before it might have been this more of a

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:49.090 
before it might have been this more of a
feminist<00:05:47.770> conversation<00:05:48.770> about

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:49.100 
feminist conversation about

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:52.960 
feminist conversation about
objectification<00:05:50.170> when<00:05:51.170> I<00:05:51.200> was<00:05:51.470> in<00:05:51.650> my<00:05:51.860> 20s<00:05:52.850> and

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:52.970 
objectification when I was in my 20s and

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:55.420 
objectification when I was in my 20s and
30s<00:05:53.420> using<00:05:54.110> the<00:05:54.260> image<00:05:54.530> of<00:05:54.710> the<00:05:54.860> vessel<00:05:55.220> as<00:05:55.400> a

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:55.430 
30s using the image of the vessel as a

00:05:55.430 --> 00:05:58.060 
30s using the image of the vessel as a
metaphor<00:05:56.030> to<00:05:56.810> talk<00:05:57.020> about<00:05:57.140> other<00:05:57.410> things<00:05:57.530> to

00:05:58.060 --> 00:05:58.070 
metaphor to talk about other things to

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:00.670 
metaphor to talk about other things to
talk<00:05:58.280> about<00:05:58.450> female<00:05:59.450> and<00:06:00.020> body<00:06:00.290> and

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:00.680 
talk about female and body and

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:04.360 
talk about female and body and
containment<00:06:01.540> and<00:06:02.540> then<00:06:02.720> later<00:06:03.020> on<00:06:03.169> I<00:06:03.740> used<00:06:04.130> it

00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:04.370 
containment and then later on I used it

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:07.990 
containment and then later on I used it
to<00:06:04.730> talk<00:06:04.940> about<00:06:05.350> beauty<00:06:06.350> and<00:06:06.740> refinement<00:06:07.220> and

00:06:07.990 --> 00:06:08.000 
to talk about beauty and refinement and

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.400 
to talk about beauty and refinement and
classical<00:06:08.690> form<00:06:09.490> fragility<00:06:10.870> so<00:06:11.870> I've<00:06:11.990> reused

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:12.410 
classical form fragility so I've reused

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:14.470 
classical form fragility so I've reused
it<00:06:12.680> in<00:06:12.890> different<00:06:13.130> ways<00:06:13.490> sort<00:06:13.910> of<00:06:14.030> as<00:06:14.270> I've

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:14.480 
it in different ways sort of as I've

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:16.659 
it in different ways sort of as I've
grown<00:06:14.690> and<00:06:15.200> thought<00:06:15.950> about<00:06:15.980> it<00:06:16.250> in<00:06:16.490> different

00:06:16.659 --> 00:06:16.669 
grown and thought about it in different

00:06:16.669 --> 00:06:20.670 
grown and thought about it in different
ways<00:06:17.000> as<00:06:17.450> a<00:06:17.510> metaphor<00:06:18.140> for<00:06:18.200> me<00:06:18.740> I<00:06:18.770> guess

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:20.680 
ways as a metaphor for me I guess

00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:27.960 
ways as a metaphor for me I guess
I<00:06:21.630> think<00:06:22.630> my<00:06:22.810> main<00:06:23.080> message<00:06:23.919> is<00:06:24.690> to<00:06:25.690> always<00:06:26.970> say

00:06:27.960 --> 00:06:27.970 
I think my main message is to always say

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:30.749 
I think my main message is to always say
to<00:06:28.000> yourself<00:06:28.509> what<00:06:28.780> if<00:06:29.100> what<00:06:30.100> if<00:06:30.130> I<00:06:30.370> did<00:06:30.580> this

00:06:30.749 --> 00:06:30.759 
to yourself what if what if I did this

00:06:30.759 --> 00:06:33.180 
to yourself what if what if I did this
what<00:06:31.270> if<00:06:31.389> I<00:06:31.539> pushed<00:06:32.320> it<00:06:32.530> this<00:06:32.680> way

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:33.190 
what if I pushed it this way

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:35.150 
what if I pushed it this way
what<00:06:33.460> if<00:06:33.669> and<00:06:33.910> I<00:06:34.300> think<00:06:34.539> that's<00:06:34.690> what<00:06:34.900> I'm

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:35.160 
what if and I think that's what I'm

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:37.590 
what if and I think that's what I'm
asking<00:06:36.160> myself<00:06:36.340> in<00:06:36.729> the<00:06:36.850> studio<00:06:37.210> all<00:06:37.449> the<00:06:37.479> time

00:06:37.590 --> 00:06:37.600 
asking myself in the studio all the time

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:40.020 
asking myself in the studio all the time
I<00:06:38.139> just<00:06:38.500> want<00:06:38.710> to<00:06:38.830> try<00:06:39.039> another<00:06:39.310> material<00:06:39.910> I

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:40.030 
I just want to try another material I

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:42.930 
I just want to try another material I
just<00:06:40.060> get<00:06:40.419> excited<00:06:40.990> about<00:06:41.199> the<00:06:41.410> process<00:06:41.940> it's

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:42.940 
just get excited about the process it's

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:46.200 
just get excited about the process it's
also<00:06:43.289> there's<00:06:44.289> you<00:06:44.620> know<00:06:45.009> I<00:06:45.250> get<00:06:45.490> challenged

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:46.210 
also there's you know I get challenged

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:49.110 
also there's you know I get challenged
by<00:06:46.479> trying<00:06:47.050> a<00:06:47.199> new<00:06:47.350> material<00:06:47.710> and<00:06:48.220> I<00:06:48.789> think

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:49.120 
by trying a new material and I think

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:51.870 
by trying a new material and I think
that<00:06:49.840> the<00:06:50.139> older<00:06:50.500> I<00:06:50.530> get<00:06:50.889> the<00:06:51.220> more<00:06:51.490> I<00:06:51.759> realize

00:06:51.870 --> 00:06:51.880 
that the older I get the more I realize

00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:55.950 
that the older I get the more I realize
I<00:06:52.600> don't<00:06:53.139> know<00:06:53.680> and<00:06:54.520> there's<00:06:55.180> so<00:06:55.419> much<00:06:55.570> I<00:06:55.750> want

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:55.960 
I don't know and there's so much I want

00:06:55.960 --> 00:06:58.560 
I don't know and there's so much I want
to<00:06:56.020> learn<00:06:56.520> yeah<00:06:57.580> there's<00:06:57.880> some<00:06:58.150> one<00:06:58.360> more

00:06:58.560 --> 00:06:58.570 
to learn yeah there's some one more

00:06:58.570 --> 00:07:01.760 
to learn yeah there's some one more
thing<00:06:58.840> you<00:06:58.870> want<00:06:59.169> to<00:06:59.229> try<00:06:59.400> you're<00:07:00.400> driven<00:07:00.849> by

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:01.770 
thing you want to try you're driven by

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:05.760 
thing you want to try you're driven by
whatever<00:07:02.770> you<00:07:03.160> make<00:07:03.430> not<00:07:03.699> being<00:07:04.210> exactly<00:07:05.080> what

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:05.770 
whatever you make not being exactly what

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:08.460 
whatever you make not being exactly what
you<00:07:05.949> wanted<00:07:06.699> it<00:07:06.849> to<00:07:06.880> be<00:07:07.210> so<00:07:07.750> you<00:07:07.780> go<00:07:08.110> at<00:07:08.320> it

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:08.470 
you wanted it to be so you go at it

00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:12.120
