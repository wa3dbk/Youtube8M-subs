00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.120 
opens like this and I did put two
magnets<00:01:41.170> in<00:01:41.560> there<00:01:41.740> so<00:01:42.570> you'll<00:01:43.570> see<00:01:43.890> so<00:01:44.890> what<00:01:45.100> I

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:57.480 
it just was on the inside cover
I<00:01:54.570> added<00:01:55.570> some<00:01:55.960> little<00:01:56.409> this<00:01:56.710> is<00:01:56.770> the<00:01:57.070> die-cuts

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:57.490 
I added some little this is the die-cuts

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:59.220 
I added some little this is the die-cuts
I<00:01:57.610> only<00:01:57.790> use<00:01:58.090> the<00:01:58.240> paper<00:01:58.450> collection<00:01:58.720> I<00:01:59.050> did

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:23.530 
name in the paper line and you open it
up<00:02:22.190> like<00:02:22.250> this<00:02:22.550> and<00:02:22.819> there's<00:02:22.970> a<00:02:23.000> place<00:02:23.180> for<00:02:23.390> too

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:23.540 
up like this and there's a place for too

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.380 
up like this and there's a place for too
little<00:02:23.630> photos<00:02:23.989> there<00:02:24.610> and<00:02:25.610> over<00:02:26.120> here<00:02:26.150> you

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
little photos there and over here you

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.020 
little photos there and over here you
can<00:02:26.540> put<00:02:26.690> a<00:02:26.720> photo<00:02:26.930> here<00:02:27.470> and<00:02:27.950> then<00:02:28.430> this<00:02:28.730> is

can put a photo here and then this is

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.240 
can put a photo here and then this is
the<00:02:29.330> photo<00:02:29.569> mats<00:02:29.900> that<00:02:30.230> pull<00:02:30.590> out<00:02:30.830> and<00:02:31.069> again

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
the photo mats that pull out and again

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:32.979 
the photo mats that pull out and again
these<00:02:31.459> pages<00:02:31.760> are<00:02:32.000> 6x6

00:02:32.979 --> 00:02:32.989 
these pages are 6x6

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:35.199 
these pages are 6x6
so<00:02:33.890> there's<00:02:34.100> that<00:02:34.250> side<00:02:34.580> and<00:02:34.700> the<00:02:34.790> photo<00:02:35.000> mats

00:02:35.199 --> 00:02:35.209 
so there's that side and the photo mats

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:42.550 
so there's that side and the photo mats
are<00:02:35.360> all<00:02:35.510> plain<00:02:38.500> and<00:02:39.670> this<00:02:40.670> flips<00:02:41.000> over<00:02:41.239> and<00:02:41.930> on

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:42.560 
are all plain and this flips over and on

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:46.660 
are all plain and this flips over and on
this<00:02:42.769> inside<00:02:43.370> cover<00:02:44.180> I<00:02:45.130> have<00:02:46.130> a<00:02:46.160> little<00:02:46.430> tag

this inside cover I have a little tag

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.729 
this inside cover I have a little tag
pocket<00:02:47.239> and<00:02:47.450> again<00:02:47.690> this<00:02:47.840> is<00:02:47.989> a<00:02:48.019> flower<00:02:48.319> from

a<00:02:54.110> little<00:02:54.610> oopsie<00:02:55.750> tag<00:02:57.040> see<00:02:58.040> what<00:02:58.250> I<00:02:58.310> mean<00:02:58.459> it's

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
a little oopsie tag see what I mean it's

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:00.910 
a little oopsie tag see what I mean it's
just<00:02:58.790> giving<00:02:59.030> me<00:02:59.090> fits<00:02:59.330> right<00:03:00.140> here<00:03:00.200> and<00:03:00.680> then

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:00.920 
just giving me fits right here and then

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:02.770 
just giving me fits right here and then
there's<00:03:01.100> the<00:03:01.220> sign<00:03:01.400> paper<00:03:01.580> on<00:03:01.760> the<00:03:01.910> back<00:03:02.060> so

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
there's the sign paper on the back so

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:04.809 
there's the sign paper on the back so
then<00:03:02.930> it<00:03:03.049> flips<00:03:03.200> open<00:03:03.530> like<00:03:03.709> this<00:03:03.980> and<00:03:04.400> then<00:03:04.700> it

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:04.819 
then it flips open like this and then it

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:06.910 
then it flips open like this and then it
flips<00:03:05.060> open<00:03:05.330> like<00:03:06.019> this<00:03:06.410> and<00:03:06.470> there's<00:03:06.860> a

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:06.920 
flips open like this and there's a

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:08.740 
flips open like this and there's a
magnet<00:03:07.340> right<00:03:07.400> there<00:03:07.850> but<00:03:08.090> I<00:03:08.120> probably<00:03:08.420> should

00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:08.750 
magnet right there but I probably should

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:11.170 
magnet right there but I probably should
have<00:03:08.780> put<00:03:08.930> another<00:03:09.170> things<00:03:09.410> there<00:03:10.030> so<00:03:11.030> that

00:03:11.170 --> 00:03:11.180 
have put another things there so that

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:12.699 
have put another things there so that
goes<00:03:11.360> back<00:03:11.390> in<00:03:11.720> there<00:03:11.840> that's<00:03:12.109> the<00:03:12.290> inside

00:03:12.699 --> 00:03:12.709 
goes back in there that's the inside

00:03:12.709 --> 00:03:15.729 
goes back in there that's the inside
cover<00:03:12.980> and<00:03:13.600> over<00:03:14.600> here<00:03:14.810> I<00:03:14.840> have<00:03:15.019> a<00:03:15.170> loose<00:03:15.440> frame

leftover die-cuts that I just kind of
put<00:05:17.920> together<00:05:18.070> and<00:05:18.490> create<00:05:18.820> it<00:05:18.910> a<00:05:19.030> little

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:19.210 
put together and create it a little

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:22.230 
put together and create it a little
booklet<00:05:20.110> there<00:05:20.440> so<00:05:20.860> those<00:05:21.100> go<00:05:21.340> back<00:05:21.370> in<00:05:21.910> here

00:05:25.030 --> 00:05:27.060 
and then this is loose so you can stick
them<00:05:25.150> in<00:05:25.420> there<00:05:25.600> and<00:05:25.900> I<00:05:26.110> added<00:05:26.350> a<00:05:26.560> little<00:05:26.590> label
