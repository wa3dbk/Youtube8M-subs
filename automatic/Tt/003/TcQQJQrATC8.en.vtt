my<00:00:32.920> recording<00:00:33.340> messed<00:00:33.520> up<00:00:33.730> on<00:00:33.910> the<00:00:34.059> ps3<00:00:34.360> so<00:00:34.780> I'm

00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:34.840 
my recording messed up on the ps3 so I'm

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:36.720 
my recording messed up on the ps3 so I'm
going<00:00:34.960> to<00:00:34.989> show<00:00:35.170> it<00:00:35.230> to<00:00:35.320> you<00:00:35.530> on<00:00:35.650> the<00:00:35.800> ps4<00:00:36.129> it's

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:36.730 
going to show it to you on the ps4 it's

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:38.220 
going to show it to you on the ps4 it's
actually<00:00:37.000> pretty<00:00:37.210> easy<00:00:37.330> to<00:00:37.720> be<00:00:37.840> honest<00:00:38.110> I

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:38.230 
actually pretty easy to be honest I

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:39.780 
actually pretty easy to be honest I
think<00:00:38.290> it's<00:00:38.530> the<00:00:38.620> easiest<00:00:38.980> one<00:00:39.250> all<00:00:39.550> you<00:00:39.670> need

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:39.790 
think it's the easiest one all you need

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:41.400 
think it's the easiest one all you need
to<00:00:39.910> do<00:00:40.000> is<00:00:40.120> avoid<00:00:40.390> those<00:00:40.629> mortars<00:00:41.110> to<00:00:41.230> just

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:41.410 
to do is avoid those mortars to just

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:43.139 
to do is avoid those mortars to just
pick<00:00:41.590> your<00:00:41.739> line<00:00:41.980> and<00:00:42.250> keep<00:00:42.399> moving<00:00:42.700> away<00:00:42.790> from

00:00:43.139 --> 00:00:43.149 
pick your line and keep moving away from

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:44.430 
pick your line and keep moving away from
the<00:00:43.239> mortars<00:00:43.630> you<00:00:43.809> should<00:00:43.989> be<00:00:44.079> able<00:00:44.140> to<00:00:44.260> do

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:44.440 
the mortars you should be able to do

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:45.780 
the mortars you should be able to do
that<00:00:44.620> and<00:00:44.800> once<00:00:44.920> you've<00:00:45.070> done<00:00:45.100> that<00:00:45.280> just<00:00:45.610> get

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:45.790 
that and once you've done that just get

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:47.280 
that and once you've done that just get
in<00:00:45.940> and<00:00:46.180> try<00:00:46.420> and<00:00:46.540> hit<00:00:46.690> the<00:00:46.809> hull<00:00:46.960> of<00:00:47.140> the<00:00:47.260> ship

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:47.290 
in and try and hit the hull of the ship

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:49.080 
in and try and hit the hull of the ship
both<00:00:47.800> sides<00:00:48.100> of<00:00:48.250> the<00:00:48.309> ship<00:00:48.550> are<00:00:48.730> actually<00:00:48.969> even

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:49.090 
both sides of the ship are actually even

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:50.490 
both sides of the ship are actually even
vulnerable<00:00:49.480> to<00:00:49.600> damage<00:00:49.750> so<00:00:50.050> you<00:00:50.140> need<00:00:50.290> to<00:00:50.380> make

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:50.500 
vulnerable to damage so you need to make

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.110 
vulnerable to damage so you need to make
sure<00:00:50.530> you<00:00:50.800> can<00:00:50.950> just<00:00:51.100> get<00:00:51.250> some<00:00:51.430> good<00:00:51.610> shots<00:00:51.850> in

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:52.120 
sure you can just get some good shots in

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.910 
sure you can just get some good shots in
on<00:00:52.300> the<00:00:52.480> hull<00:00:52.690> I've<00:00:52.930> got<00:00:53.140> a<00:00:53.170> lot<00:00:53.380> of<00:00:53.469> armor<00:00:53.770> so<00:00:53.890> I

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:53.920 
on the hull I've got a lot of armor so I

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:55.590 
on the hull I've got a lot of armor so I
can<00:00:54.100> actually<00:00:54.190> take<00:00:54.520> a<00:00:54.550> few<00:00:54.850> broad<00:00:55.090> sighs<00:00:55.360> and

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:55.600 
can actually take a few broad sighs and

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.000 
can actually take a few broad sighs and
just<00:00:55.629> wait<00:00:55.930> for<00:00:55.960> the<00:00:56.170> ship<00:00:56.230> to<00:00:56.500> go<00:00:56.620> in<00:00:56.710> front<00:00:56.920> of

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.010 
just wait for the ship to go in front of

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:58.920 
just wait for the ship to go in front of
me<00:00:57.070> so<00:00:57.340> I<00:00:57.370> can<00:00:57.579> hit<00:00:57.670> the<00:00:57.790> back<00:00:57.940> again<00:00:58.270> otherwise

00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:58.930 
me so I can hit the back again otherwise

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:00.840 
me so I can hit the back again otherwise
you<00:00:59.200> can<00:00:59.320> keep<00:00:59.500> maneuvering<00:01:00.040> far<00:01:00.309> away<00:01:00.579> and

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:00.850 
you can keep maneuvering far away and

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:02.520 
you can keep maneuvering far away and
then<00:01:00.969> try<00:01:01.239> and<00:01:01.300> get<00:01:01.480> in<00:01:01.660> and<00:01:01.870> hit<00:01:01.989> the<00:01:02.020> hole<00:01:02.289> you

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:02.530 
then try and get in and hit the hole you

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:03.750 
then try and get in and hit the hole you
can<00:01:02.680> do<00:01:02.800> it<00:01:02.920> that<00:01:03.070> way<00:01:03.100> it's<00:01:03.399> not<00:01:03.579> too

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:03.760 
can do it that way it's not too

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.730 
can do it that way it's not too
difficult<00:01:04.000> like<00:01:04.750> I<00:01:04.780> said<00:01:05.020> before<00:01:05.140> as<00:01:05.440> long<00:01:05.470> as

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:05.740 
difficult like I said before as long as

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:07.170 
difficult like I said before as long as
you<00:01:05.860> miss<00:01:06.009> those<00:01:06.190> mortars<00:01:06.729> you're<00:01:06.910> gonna<00:01:07.000> be

alright<00:01:07.330> so<00:01:07.869> just<00:01:07.899> keep<00:01:08.200> turning<00:01:08.410> at<00:01:08.710> speed

00:01:08.999 --> 00:01:09.009 
alright so just keep turning at speed
