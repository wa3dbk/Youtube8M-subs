00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.789 
because the faster I make the sale of
the<00:01:51.240> less<00:01:51.390> it's<00:01:51.540> going<00:01:51.750> to<00:01:51.899> cost<00:01:52.110> me<00:01:52.259> in

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:52.799 
the less it's going to cost me in

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:58.330 
the less it's going to cost me in
ongoing<00:01:53.399> promotion<00:01:55.969> so<00:01:56.969> why<00:01:57.450> do<00:01:57.509> I<00:01:57.719> do<00:01:57.840> this

00:01:58.330 --> 00:01:58.340 
ongoing promotion so why do I do this

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.100 
ongoing promotion so why do I do this
well<00:01:59.340> first<00:01:59.759> of<00:01:59.939> all<00:02:00.030> I<00:02:00.090> genuinely<00:02:00.540> want<00:02:00.899> to

00:02:11.619 --> 00:02:11.629 
and i genuinely now think it's time I

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:13.899 
and i genuinely now think it's time I
started<00:02:12.080> to<00:02:12.200> pay<00:02:12.379> something<00:02:12.650> back<00:02:13.010> so<00:02:13.760> I'm

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:23.239 
children and mortar aid the third reason

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:25.839 
children and mortar aid the third reason
is<00:02:23.540> I<00:02:23.780> don't<00:02:24.140> want<00:02:24.470> you<00:02:24.590> to<00:02:24.769> fail<00:02:24.980> and<00:02:25.340> drop<00:02:25.640> out

charities I want regular sustainable

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.330 
charities I want regular sustainable
income<00:02:35.060> so<00:02:35.959> if<00:02:36.079> you're<00:02:36.260> making<00:02:36.650> a<00:02:36.739> profit<00:02:36.980> it'd

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:37.340 
income so if you're making a profit it'd

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.550 
income so if you're making a profit it'd
be<00:02:37.549> foolish<00:02:37.790> for<00:02:37.970> you<00:02:38.239> not<00:02:38.450> to<00:02:38.599> continue<00:02:38.930> and

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:39.560 
be foolish for you not to continue and

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.380 
be foolish for you not to continue and
that<00:02:39.620> means<00:02:40.159> the<00:02:40.340> income<00:02:40.640> that<00:02:40.670> I<00:02:40.940> receive

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:41.390 
that means the income that I receive

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.750 
that means the income that I receive
will<00:02:41.930> be<00:02:41.959> a<00:02:42.110> constant<00:02:42.379> just<00:02:43.220> as<00:02:43.370> the<00:02:43.519> income

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760 
will be a constant just as the income

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.869 
will be a constant just as the income
you<00:02:43.910> receive<00:02:44.269> will<00:02:44.420> be<00:02:44.480> a<00:02:44.599> constant<00:02:45.819> now<00:02:46.819> the

you receive will be a constant now the

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:49.410 
you receive will be a constant now the
way<00:02:47.060> the<00:02:47.209> pay<00:02:47.390> plan<00:02:47.569> is<00:02:47.780> leveraged<00:02:48.319> I<00:02:48.680> also

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:49.420 
way the pay plan is leveraged I also

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:52.479 
way the pay plan is leveraged I also
when<00:02:50.420> I<00:02:50.450> make<00:02:50.750> this<00:02:50.900> Excel<00:02:51.349> for<00:02:51.590> you<00:02:51.739> I<00:02:51.980> get

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:52.489 
when I make this Excel for you I get

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:54.819 
when I make this Excel for you I get
three<00:02:52.700> of<00:02:52.730> them<00:02:52.970> back<00:02:53.180> for<00:02:53.599> me<00:02:53.780> because<00:02:54.680> that's

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:54.829 
three of them back for me because that's

00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:56.710 
three of them back for me because that's
the<00:02:55.010> way<00:02:55.040> the<00:02:55.280> plan<00:02:55.489> works<00:02:55.790> you<00:02:56.120> must<00:02:56.329> pass<00:02:56.540> up

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:56.720 
the way the plan works you must pass up

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:59.470 
the way the plan works you must pass up
three<00:02:56.989> of<00:02:57.079> your<00:02:57.200> first<00:02:57.470> six<00:02:57.739> sales<00:02:58.480> but

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
three of your first six sales but

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.660 
three of your first six sales but
similarly<00:02:59.930> you're<00:03:00.290> going<00:03:00.530> to<00:03:00.650> receive<00:03:00.769> three

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:01.670 
similarly you're going to receive three

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:04.720 
similarly you're going to receive three
of<00:03:01.849> your<00:03:02.060> people's<00:03:02.540> first<00:03:02.989> six<00:03:03.379> sales<00:03:03.680> so<00:03:04.519> by

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:04.730 
of your people's first six sales so by

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:06.849 
of your people's first six sales so by
passing<00:03:05.150> up<00:03:05.269> three<00:03:05.569> you'll<00:03:06.140> therefore<00:03:06.560> gain

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:06.859 
passing up three you'll therefore gain

00:03:06.859 --> 00:03:08.470 
passing up three you'll therefore gain
three<00:03:07.190> from<00:03:07.430> each<00:03:07.519> of<00:03:07.700> the<00:03:07.819> retain<00:03:08.180> three

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:08.480 
three from each of the retain three

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:11.740 
three from each of the retain three
sales<00:03:08.780> and<00:03:09.230> 3<00:03:10.069> times<00:03:10.340> 3<00:03:10.430> is<00:03:10.579> 9<00:03:10.700> so<00:03:11.180> that<00:03:11.660> will

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:11.750 
sales and 3 times 3 is 9 so that will

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:13.809 
sales and 3 times 3 is 9 so that will
give<00:03:11.780> you<00:03:12.019> 12<00:03:12.319> commissions<00:03:12.829> in<00:03:12.980> all<00:03:13.160> rather

00:03:13.809 --> 00:03:13.819 
give you 12 commissions in all rather

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:16.479 
give you 12 commissions in all rather
than<00:03:13.970> just<00:03:14.329> six<00:03:14.660> and<00:03:14.959> that's<00:03:15.019> powerful<00:03:15.489> but

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:16.489 
than just six and that's powerful but

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:18.009 
than just six and that's powerful but
I'm<00:03:16.609> not<00:03:16.819> taking<00:03:17.239> those<00:03:17.419> figures<00:03:17.840> into

00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:18.019 
I'm not taking those figures into

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:20.349 
I'm not taking those figures into
account<00:03:18.440> when<00:03:19.040> I<00:03:19.069> talk<00:03:19.400> about<00:03:19.430> the<00:03:19.970> profit

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:20.359 
account when I talk about the profit

00:03:20.359 --> 00:03:22.870 
account when I talk about the profit
that<00:03:20.389> you<00:03:20.599> could<00:03:20.810> get<00:03:21.049> and<00:03:21.349> that<00:03:21.889> as<00:03:22.190> I<00:03:22.310> said<00:03:22.519> is

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:22.880 
that you could get and that as I said is

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.699 
that you could get and that as I said is
anywhere<00:03:23.299> between<00:03:23.359> a<00:03:23.750> net<00:03:24.019> profit<00:03:24.200> of<00:03:24.440> thirty
