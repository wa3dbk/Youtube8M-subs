00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:13.310 

which<00:00:10.530> is<00:00:10.710> a<00:00:10.740> really<00:00:11.010> simple<00:00:11.219> plane<00:00:12.110> the<00:00:13.110> blimp

00:00:13.310 --> 00:00:13.320 
which is a really simple plane the blimp

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.820 
which is a really simple plane the blimp
is<00:00:13.440> actually<00:00:13.740> pretty<00:00:13.950> interesting<00:00:14.340> because

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:15.830 
is actually pretty interesting because

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:20.779 
is actually pretty interesting because
it's<00:00:16.830> really<00:00:17.240> very<00:00:18.240> very<00:00:18.630> easy<00:00:18.869> to<00:00:19.140> make<00:00:19.789> and

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
it's really very very easy to make and

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:26.900 
it's really very very easy to make and
it<00:00:20.880> doesn't<00:00:21.180> exactly<00:00:21.510> fly<00:00:22.230> so<00:00:24.500> the<00:00:25.500> reason<00:00:25.910> is

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
it doesn't exactly fly so the reason is

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.130 
it doesn't exactly fly so the reason is
because<00:00:27.900> of<00:00:28.500> the<00:00:28.590> way<00:00:28.920> it<00:00:29.099> falls<00:00:30.109> through<00:00:31.109> the

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
because of the way it falls through the

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.440 
because of the way it falls through the
air<00:00:31.349> rather<00:00:31.619> fly<00:00:32.040> through<00:00:32.309> the<00:00:32.369> air<00:00:32.489> you<00:00:32.759> just

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
air rather fly through the air you just

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.069 
air rather fly through the air you just
take<00:00:33.600> a<00:00:33.630> sheet<00:00:34.110> of<00:00:34.260> a4<00:00:34.380> paper<00:00:35.540> or<00:00:36.540> letter<00:00:36.840> paper

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
take a sheet of a4 paper or letter paper

00:00:37.079 --> 00:01:03.399 
take a sheet of a4 paper or letter paper
if<00:00:37.350> you're<00:00:37.469> in<00:00:37.559> the<00:00:37.680> u.s.<00:00:37.890> you<00:00:38.899> essentially

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:03.409 

00:01:03.409 --> 00:01:07.330 

create<00:01:04.409> two<00:01:04.939> tears

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:07.340 
create two tears

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.609 
create two tears
equidistant<00:01:08.340> from<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.610> ends<00:01:09.170> then<00:01:10.170> you<00:01:10.290> swap

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
equidistant from the ends then you swap

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:19.149 
equidistant from the ends then you swap
the<00:01:10.799> plane<00:01:11.180> together<00:01:12.290> like<00:01:13.290> this<00:01:18.140> pretty

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:19.159 
the plane together like this pretty

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:23.210 
the plane together like this pretty
simple<00:01:20.210> in<00:01:21.210> terms<00:01:21.600> of<00:01:21.869> how<00:01:22.500> you<00:01:22.560> make<00:01:22.830> in<00:01:23.040> how

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
simple in terms of how you make in how

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.520 
simple in terms of how you make in how
you<00:01:23.280> design<00:01:23.490> it<00:01:23.790> nothing<00:01:25.850> there<00:01:26.850> but<00:01:27.659> the

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
you design it nothing there but the

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.899 
you design it nothing there but the
really<00:01:28.860> special<00:01:29.159> thing<00:01:29.549> is<00:01:30.229> how<00:01:31.229> it<00:01:31.350> falls<00:01:31.909> so

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
really special thing is how it falls so

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:34.100 
really special thing is how it falls so
you<00:01:32.970> can<00:01:33.090> get<00:01:33.180> a<00:01:33.210> bit<00:01:33.420> of<00:01:33.450> a<00:01:33.600> view<00:01:33.659> of<00:01:33.869> it<00:01:33.960> like

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
you can get a bit of a view of it like

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.210 
you can get a bit of a view of it like
this<00:01:34.259> you've<00:01:34.560> really<00:01:34.770> got<00:01:34.920> to<00:01:34.979> try<00:01:35.100> it

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:35.220 
this you've really got to try it

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:37.880 
this you've really got to try it
yourself<00:01:35.960> you<00:01:36.960> can<00:01:37.049> see<00:01:37.409> the<00:01:37.560> way<00:01:37.680> that<00:01:37.829> it

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
yourself you can see the way that it

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.319 
yourself you can see the way that it
falls<00:01:38.579> in<00:01:38.880> sort<00:01:39.150> of<00:01:39.210> a<00:01:39.450> spiraling<00:01:40.110> motion

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:41.329 
falls in sort of a spiraling motion

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:44.090 
falls in sort of a spiraling motion
means<00:01:42.329> that<00:01:42.600> it<00:01:42.990> looks<00:01:43.320> like<00:01:43.439> a<00:01:43.560> blimp<00:01:43.860> as<00:01:44.009> it

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100 
means that it looks like a blimp as it

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:45.649 
means that it looks like a blimp as it
goes<00:01:44.250> through<00:01:44.280> the<00:01:44.520> air<00:01:44.670> and<00:01:45.270> it's<00:01:45.420> actually

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:45.659 
goes through the air and it's actually

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:47.149 
goes through the air and it's actually
really<00:01:45.810> important<00:01:46.350> which<00:01:46.470> way<00:01:46.619> you<00:01:46.680> do<00:01:46.890> it<00:01:46.979> if

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
really important which way you do it if

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.539 
really important which way you do it if
you<00:01:47.280> flip<00:01:47.610> it<00:01:47.640> with<00:01:48.329> the<00:01:48.509> top<00:01:48.720> edge<00:01:49.250> going<00:01:50.250> this

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
you flip it with the top edge going this

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.510 
you flip it with the top edge going this
way<00:01:50.790> in<00:01:51.689> this<00:01:51.869> direction<00:01:52.409> then<00:01:53.250> the<00:01:53.340> plane

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
way in this direction then the plane

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.609 
way in this direction then the plane
will<00:01:53.670> fall<00:01:53.850> in<00:01:53.970> that<00:01:54.119> direction<00:01:54.500> whereas<00:01:55.500> if

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
will fall in that direction whereas if

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.310 
will fall in that direction whereas if
you<00:01:55.799> do<00:01:55.950> it<00:01:56.100> the<00:01:56.280> other<00:01:56.310> way<00:01:57.140> it'll<00:01:58.140> come<00:01:58.290> back

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
you do it the other way it'll come back

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.800 
you do it the other way it'll come back
this<00:01:58.619> way<00:01:58.829> so<00:01:59.700> that's<00:02:00.180> how<00:02:00.270> you<00:02:00.329> do<00:02:00.479> the<00:02:00.570> blimp

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810 
this way so that's how you do the blimp

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:04.310 
this way so that's how you do the blimp
hope<00:02:01.500> you<00:02:01.860> enjoy
