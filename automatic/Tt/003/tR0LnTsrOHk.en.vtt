00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:27.600 
you know I once you started doing your

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.960 
you know I once you started doing your
research<00:02:27.750> and<00:02:28.260> trying<00:02:29.070> different<00:02:29.250> stuff<00:02:29.670> you

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:29.970 
research and trying different stuff you

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:32.060 
research and trying different stuff you
see<00:02:30.660> that<00:02:30.840> that<00:02:31.050> brown<00:02:31.290> rice<00:02:31.560> may<00:02:31.830> have<00:02:31.920> real

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:32.070 
see that that brown rice may have real

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:33.680 
see that that brown rice may have real
ain't<00:02:32.280> no<00:02:32.370> different<00:02:32.790> from<00:02:32.850> any<00:02:33.120> other<00:02:33.180> corner

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:33.690 
ain't no different from any other corner

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.570 
ain't no different from any other corner
so<00:02:33.870> when<00:02:33.990> the<00:02:34.050> difference<00:02:34.470> is<00:02:34.650> is<00:02:34.950> to<00:02:35.310> follow

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:35.580 
so when the difference is is to follow

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.700 
so when the difference is is to follow
it's<00:02:36.420> got<00:02:36.600> a<00:02:36.630> little<00:02:36.720> bit<00:02:36.870> more<00:02:36.900> protein<00:02:37.200> in<00:02:37.590> it

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:37.710 
it's got a little bit more protein in it

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:39.230 
it's got a little bit more protein in it
you<00:02:38.040> just<00:02:38.250> got<00:02:38.370> fiber<00:02:38.670> but<00:02:38.910> it's<00:02:39.060> not<00:02:39.210> a

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:39.240
