00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:08.600 
and these were the three primary styles
of<00:01:01.020> dance<00:01:01.230> that<00:01:01.649> I<00:01:01.920> really<00:01:02.399> did<00:01:02.640> I<00:01:07.280> also<00:01:08.280> did

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
of dance that I really did I also did

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:10.580 
of dance that I really did I also did
get<00:01:09.060> into<00:01:09.240> locking<00:01:09.780> and<00:01:09.930> popping<00:01:10.410> and

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
get into locking and popping and

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.920 
get into locking and popping and
dancehall<00:01:11.310> and<00:01:11.610> stuff<00:01:11.850> but<00:01:12.149> these<00:01:12.479> were<00:01:12.750> the

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
dancehall and stuff but these were the

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:22.920 
dancehall and stuff but these were the
major<00:01:13.470> styles<00:01:14.430> I<00:01:14.520> got<00:01:14.700> into

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:22.930 

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:25.320 

I<00:01:22.960> think<00:01:23.950> Street<00:01:24.190> dance<00:01:24.370> is<00:01:24.550> the<00:01:24.730> most<00:01:24.940> raw

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:25.330 
I think Street dance is the most raw

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:32.430 
I think Street dance is the most raw
form<00:01:25.870> of<00:01:26.080> dance<00:01:26.350> period<00:01:30.780> now<00:01:31.780> is<00:01:31.960> it<00:01:32.080> a<00:01:32.170> point

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:32.440 
form of dance period now is it a point

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:36.090 
form of dance period now is it a point
back<00:01:33.190> in<00:01:33.400> the<00:01:33.490> US<00:01:33.790> that<00:01:34.170> like<00:01:35.170> my<00:01:35.560> career<00:01:35.920> could

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:36.100 
back in the US that like my career could

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.980

have just capable in the mire but I

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.170 
have just capable in the mire but I
again<00:01:38.740> like<00:01:39.010> that<00:01:39.220> wasn't<00:01:39.370> really<00:01:39.730> fulfilling

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:40.180 
again like that wasn't really fulfilling
