00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:22.010 
there so you really gonna watch your ass
actually<00:01:20.159> on<00:01:20.340> this<00:01:20.490> spot<00:01:20.729> so<00:01:21.090> I<00:01:21.479> usually<00:01:21.930> take

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
actually on this spot so I usually take

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.539 
actually on this spot so I usually take
that<00:01:22.200> spot<00:01:22.380> i<00:01:22.439> put<00:01:22.680> a<00:01:22.710> century<00:01:23.009> gun<00:01:23.130> behind<00:01:23.250> me

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
that spot i put a century gun behind me

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.249 
that spot i put a century gun behind me
and<00:01:23.670> it<00:01:23.759> helps<00:01:24.030> me<00:01:24.180> watch<00:01:24.630> that<00:01:24.840> prop<00:01:25.080> they

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
and it helps me watch that prop they

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:26.810 
and it helps me watch that prop they
flooded<00:01:25.590> or<00:01:25.770> anything<00:01:26.130> in<00:01:26.250> watch<00:01:26.369> that<00:01:26.580> corner

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
flooded or anything in watch that corner

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.929 
flooded or anything in watch that corner
so<00:01:28.009> that's<00:01:29.009> that<00:01:29.159> spot<00:01:29.430> back<00:01:29.670> left<00:01:29.909> corner

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
so that's that spot back left corner

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:31.999 
so that's that spot back left corner
then<00:01:30.450> this<00:01:30.600> is<00:01:30.750> like<00:01:30.930> the<00:01:31.229> middle<00:01:31.650> just

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
then this is like the middle just

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:33.020 
then this is like the middle just
something<00:01:32.280> to<00:01:32.310> come<00:01:32.460> sit<00:01:32.640> in<00:01:32.700> this<00:01:32.759> corner

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
something to come sit in this corner

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.179 
something to come sit in this corner
middle<00:01:33.270> map<00:01:33.590> and<00:01:34.590> basically<00:01:34.890> we<00:01:35.009> need<00:01:35.040> to

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
middle map and basically we need to

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:36.410 
middle map and basically we need to
watch<00:01:35.310> three<00:01:35.549> spots<00:01:35.820> the<00:01:35.939> one<00:01:36.060> right<00:01:36.210> in<00:01:36.270> front

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
watch three spots the one right in front

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:37.880 
watch three spots the one right in front
and<00:01:36.570> there's<00:01:36.720> two<00:01:36.930> on<00:01:37.259> those<00:01:37.530> both<00:01:37.710> those

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
and there's two on those both those

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.230 
and there's two on those both those
barrels<00:01:38.189> and<00:01:38.400> spot<00:01:38.549> on<00:01:38.640> those<00:01:38.759> girls<00:01:39.030> across

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:39.240 
barrels and spot on those girls across

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:41.270 
barrels and spot on those girls across
the<00:01:39.450> map<00:01:39.630> so<00:01:39.960> and<00:01:40.590> you<00:01:40.740> don't<00:01:40.890> really<00:01:41.100> watch

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
the map so and you don't really watch

where and then back in this corner this
is<00:01:49.049> really<00:01:49.259> important<00:01:49.740> you<00:01:49.770> guys<00:01:49.920> do<00:01:50.490> not<00:01:50.640> push

is really important you guys do not push
up<00:01:51.270> there's<00:01:51.450> a<00:01:51.540> spawn<00:01:51.720> out<00:01:51.840> there<00:01:51.990> you<00:01:52.079> can<00:01:52.229> sit

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
up there's a spawn out there you can sit

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:53.899 
up there's a spawn out there you can sit
behind<00:01:52.530> them<00:01:52.860> but<00:01:53.250> when<00:01:53.399> you<00:01:53.460> do<00:01:53.579> that<00:01:53.759> it

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
behind them but when you do that it

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.819 
behind them but when you do that it
blocks<00:01:54.149> that<00:01:54.479> left<00:01:54.780> spawn<00:01:55.110> and<00:01:55.439> it<00:01:55.530> really

00:01:55.819 --> 00:01:55.829 
blocks that left spawn and it really

00:01:55.829 --> 00:01:57.620 
blocks that left spawn and it really
makes<00:01:56.100> them<00:01:56.250> push<00:01:56.399> up<00:01:56.579> respond<00:01:57.299> and<00:01:57.479> bar

heavily so definitely sit lay down in
front<00:02:00.180> of<00:02:00.420> it<00:02:00.509> not<00:02:00.630> behind<00:02:00.869> it<00:02:01.079> and<00:02:01.710> then<00:02:01.799> this

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
front of it not behind it and then this

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.980
