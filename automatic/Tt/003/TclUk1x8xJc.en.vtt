at<00:01:09.140> all<00:01:09.250> it<00:01:10.250> would<00:01:10.400> have<00:01:10.490> made<00:01:10.610> this<00:01:10.850> toy

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:12.369 
at all it would have made this toy

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:14.500 
at all it would have made this toy
awesome<00:01:13.369> it<00:01:13.580> would<00:01:13.670> have<00:01:13.790> been<00:01:14.000> more<00:01:14.360> awesome

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:16.940 
than it already is if it had was able to

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:26.770 
than it already is if it had was able to
move<00:01:17.210> but<00:01:17.540> but<00:01:17.840> it<00:01:17.960> can't

attach to trypticon if you have the
connector<00:01:42.480> pieces<00:01:42.690> which<00:01:42.930> I<00:01:43.050> don't<00:01:43.290> if<00:01:43.950> I<00:01:44.130> ever

connector pieces which I don't if I ever

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.700 
connector pieces which I don't if I ever
do<00:01:44.520> get<00:01:44.700> those<00:01:44.910> and<00:01:45.330> I<00:01:45.900> do<00:01:45.960> or<00:01:46.170> Trypticon

do get those and I do or Trypticon

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.870 
do get those and I do or Trypticon
review<00:01:47.040> I'll<00:01:47.430> probably<00:01:47.850> show<00:01:48.270> that<00:01:49.640> so<00:01:50.640> for

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:50.880 
review I'll probably show that so for

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.150 
review I'll probably show that so for
transformation<00:01:51.630> into<00:01:51.870> robot<00:01:52.440> mode<00:01:52.680> it's<00:01:52.979> very

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:53.160 
transformation into robot mode it's very

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:56.840 
transformation into robot mode it's very
simple<00:01:53.610> like<00:01:53.820> most<00:01:54.060> you<00:01:54.240> one<00:01:55.460> just<00:01:56.460> take<00:01:56.670> these

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850 
simple like most you one just take these

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.120 
simple like most you one just take these
panels<00:01:57.630> and<00:01:57.840> open<00:01:58.200> them<00:01:58.320> up<00:01:58.410> to<00:01:58.770> reveal<00:01:58.979> the

00:01:59.120 --> 00:01:59.130 
panels and open them up to reveal the

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:01.790 
panels and open them up to reveal the
arms<00:01:59.430> and<00:01:59.580> then<00:01:59.670> the<00:01:59.820> head<00:02:00.170> lifts<00:02:01.170> this<00:02:01.350> panel

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:01.800 
arms and then the head lifts this panel

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:06.170 
arms and then the head lifts this panel
up<00:02:02.369> to<00:02:02.430> his<00:02:03.180> chest<00:02:04.070> then<00:02:05.070> we<00:02:05.220> can<00:02:05.430> pull<00:02:06.150> the

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
up to his chest then we can pull the

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.749 
up to his chest then we can pull the
legs<00:02:06.540> down<00:02:06.780> and<00:02:07.110> then<00:02:07.890> separate<00:02:08.369> the<00:02:08.520> halves

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
legs down and then separate the halves

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:16.190 
legs down and then separate the halves
and<00:02:11.270> you<00:02:12.270> can<00:02:12.570> adjust<00:02:12.840> those<00:02:14.660> like<00:02:15.660> so<00:02:15.930> and

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
and you can adjust those like so and

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.420 
and you can adjust those like so and
then<00:02:17.070> we'll<00:02:17.310> take<00:02:17.489> the<00:02:17.550> cab<00:02:18.650> and<00:02:19.650> flip<00:02:20.070> that<00:02:20.250> up

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:20.430 
then we'll take the cab and flip that up

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.600 
then we'll take the cab and flip that up
to<00:02:20.760> become<00:02:21.120> the<00:02:21.150> feet<00:02:21.890> of<00:02:22.890> the<00:02:23.040> robot<00:02:23.430> and

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
to become the feet of the robot and

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:24.860 
to become the feet of the robot and
that's<00:02:23.850> pretty<00:02:24.180> much<00:02:24.300> it

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
that's pretty much it

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:26.570 
that's pretty much it
rotate<00:02:25.350> the<00:02:25.500> arms<00:02:25.770> up<00:02:26.160> there's<00:02:26.370> your

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:26.580 
rotate the arms up there's your

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:28.910 
rotate the arms up there's your
articulation<00:02:26.959> as<00:02:27.959> well<00:02:28.230> as<00:02:28.380> a<00:02:28.410> little<00:02:28.650> bit<00:02:28.800> in

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:28.920 
articulation as well as a little bit in

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.320 
articulation as well as a little bit in
the<00:02:29.040> legs<00:02:29.250> there<00:02:29.580> that's<00:02:30.120> it<00:02:31.370> now<00:02:32.370> you<00:02:33.180> can

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 
the legs there that's it now you can

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.940 
the legs there that's it now you can
take<00:02:33.510> a<00:02:33.959> gun<00:02:34.380> here<00:02:34.709> which<00:02:35.280> is<00:02:35.660> usable<00:02:36.660> for

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:36.950 
take a gun here which is usable for

00:02:36.950 --> 00:02:40.280 
take a gun here which is usable for
motormaster<00:02:37.950> or<00:02:38.340> menasor<00:02:38.880> as<00:02:39.209> well<00:02:39.870> as<00:02:40.049> the

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
motormaster or menasor as well as the

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:46.220 
motormaster or menasor as well as the
sword<00:02:43.220> so<00:02:44.220> that<00:02:44.370> you<00:02:44.430> have<00:02:44.810> motormaster<00:02:45.810> in

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:46.230 
sword so that you have motormaster in

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:51.410 
sword so that you have motormaster in
robot<00:02:46.680> mode<00:02:49.010> it<00:02:50.010> is<00:02:50.070> it<00:02:50.489> is<00:02:50.730> a<00:02:50.970> little<00:02:51.209> bit

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:51.420 
robot mode it is it is a little bit

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.759 
robot mode it is it is a little bit
blocky<00:02:52.400> that<00:02:53.400> the<00:02:53.670> head<00:02:53.910> is<00:02:54.810> probably<00:02:55.110> the

00:02:55.759 --> 00:02:55.769 
blocky that the head is probably the

00:02:55.769 --> 00:02:57.350 
blocky that the head is probably the
only<00:02:55.890> thing<00:02:56.010> I<00:02:56.220> don't<00:02:56.340> like<00:02:56.489> is<00:02:56.760> this<00:02:57.000> the

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 
only thing I don't like is this the

00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:59.750 
only thing I don't like is this the
squareness<00:02:57.870> of<00:02:58.170> the<00:02:58.230> the<00:02:59.160> part<00:02:59.430> of<00:02:59.489> the<00:02:59.549> head

00:02:59.750 --> 00:02:59.760 
squareness of the the part of the head

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.330 
squareness of the the part of the head
it's<00:03:00.720> it's<00:03:00.959> bits<00:03:01.230> g1

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
it's it's bits g1

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:11.020 
it's it's bits g1
so<00:03:02.730> we<00:03:02.880> forgive<00:03:03.180> it

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:11.030 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:15.780 

you

00:03:15.780 --> 00:03:15.790 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:18.300 

now<00:03:16.180> for<00:03:16.510> getting<00:03:17.080> it<00:03:17.200> into<00:03:17.320> the<00:03:17.650> RAM<00:03:17.860> mode<00:03:18.130> I'm

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
now for getting it into the RAM mode I'm

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:19.950 
now for getting it into the RAM mode I'm
gonna<00:03:18.490> I'm<00:03:18.880> gonna<00:03:18.940> quickly<00:03:19.360> transform<00:03:19.870> it

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:19.960 
gonna I'm gonna quickly transform it

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:26.280 
gonna I'm gonna quickly transform it
back<00:03:20.170> into<00:03:22.410> into<00:03:23.940> vehicle<00:03:24.940> mode<00:03:25.170> put<00:03:26.170> the

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:26.290 
back into into vehicle mode put the

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:28.530 
back into into vehicle mode put the
halves<00:03:26.530> back<00:03:26.830> together<00:03:27.010> push<00:03:27.940> the<00:03:28.090> legs<00:03:28.300> back

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:28.540 
halves back together push the legs back

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:37.410 
halves back together push the legs back
up<00:03:33.690> flip<00:03:34.690> that<00:03:34.900> panel<00:03:35.260> down<00:03:35.850> and<00:03:36.850> then<00:03:37.240> they

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:37.420 
up flip that panel down and then they

00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:40.530 
up flip that panel down and then they
can<00:03:37.540> leave<00:03:37.660> the<00:03:37.810> arms<00:03:38.380> out<00:03:38.790> like<00:03:39.790> let<00:03:40.180> me<00:03:40.330> first

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
can leave the arms out like let me first

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.750 
can leave the arms out like let me first
open<00:03:40.900> it<00:03:41.020> up<00:03:41.140> and<00:03:41.350> then<00:03:41.440> flip<00:03:42.220> those<00:03:42.430> panels

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:42.760 
open it up and then flip those panels

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.850 
open it up and then flip those panels
off<00:03:42.970> again<00:03:44.850> and<00:03:45.900> then<00:03:46.900> turn<00:03:47.110> it<00:03:47.230> this<00:03:47.350> way<00:03:47.410> and

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:47.860 
off again and then turn it this way and

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:49.500 
off again and then turn it this way and
then<00:03:48.250> flip<00:03:48.490> the<00:03:48.610> ramp<00:03:48.790> out<00:03:48.970> and<00:03:49.180> that's<00:03:49.330> it

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
then flip the ramp out and that's it

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:55.140 
then flip the ramp out and that's it
that's<00:03:49.720> the<00:03:49.870> ramp<00:03:50.170> mode<00:03:52.470> and<00:03:53.760> this<00:03:54.760> little

00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:55.150 
that's the ramp mode and this little

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:58.290 
that's the ramp mode and this little
roller<00:03:55.420> here<00:03:56.070> that<00:03:57.070> comes<00:03:57.340> with<00:03:57.520> motormaster

00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:58.300 
roller here that comes with motormaster

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:01.590 
roller here that comes with motormaster
can<00:03:59.020> roll<00:03:59.710> up<00:04:00.070> the<00:04:00.220> ramp<00:04:00.370> and<00:04:00.670> sit<00:04:00.970> up<00:04:01.330> there

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:01.600 
can roll up the ramp and sit up there

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:12.460 
can roll up the ramp and sit up there
like<00:04:02.200> that

00:04:12.460 --> 00:04:12.470 

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:14.720 

so<00:04:13.470> like<00:04:13.620> I<00:04:13.739> was<00:04:13.769> saying<00:04:13.920> a<00:04:14.280> minor<00:04:14.489> variation

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
so like I was saying a minor variation

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:17.810 
so like I was saying a minor variation
of<00:04:15.540> this<00:04:15.810> ramp<00:04:16.350> mode<00:04:16.650> to<00:04:17.430> connect<00:04:17.730> to

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:17.820 
of this ramp mode to connect to

00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:20.150 
of this ramp mode to connect to
trypticon<00:04:18.359> you<00:04:18.989> basically<00:04:19.440> you<00:04:19.709> just<00:04:19.739> flip

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 
trypticon you basically you just flip

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:24.050 
trypticon you basically you just flip
this<00:04:20.400> around<00:04:20.750> and<00:04:21.750> then<00:04:22.040> pull<00:04:23.040> pull<00:04:23.669> it<00:04:23.790> pull

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:24.060 
this around and then pull pull it pull

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:37.550 
this around and then pull pull it pull
it<00:04:24.540> back<00:04:24.690> out<00:04:25.340> separate<00:04:26.340> the<00:04:26.490> halves<00:04:35.150> and<00:04:36.560> this

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:37.560 
it back out separate the halves and this

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:43.580 
it back out separate the halves and this
is<00:04:37.770> how<00:04:37.979> it<00:04:38.370> will<00:04:39.470> connect<00:04:40.470> to<00:04:40.590> Trypticon<00:04:42.590> it

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:43.590 
is how it will connect to Trypticon it

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:46.400 
is how it will connect to Trypticon it
looks<00:04:43.770> like<00:04:43.889> a<00:04:43.919> little<00:04:44.220> control<00:04:44.430> panel<00:04:45.410> for

00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:46.410 
looks like a little control panel for

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:48.800 
looks like a little control panel for
something<00:04:46.770> you<00:04:47.280> know<00:04:47.400> either<00:04:48.240> part<00:04:48.780> of

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:48.810 
something you know either part of

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:55.820 
something you know either part of
Trypticon<00:04:49.290> or<00:04:49.470> whatever<00:04:49.740> the<00:04:50.310> city<00:04:50.520> mode

00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:55.830 

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:58.339 

so<00:04:56.460> that's<00:04:56.639> motormaster<00:04:57.360> in<00:04:57.659> all<00:04:57.780> three<00:04:58.139> or

00:04:58.339 --> 00:04:58.349 
so that's motormaster in all three or

00:04:58.349 --> 00:05:01.100 
so that's motormaster in all three or
four<00:04:58.379> of<00:04:58.680> its<00:04:58.800> of<00:04:59.460> those<00:04:59.669> modes<00:05:00.110> pretty

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.110 
four of its of those modes pretty

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:02.899 
four of its of those modes pretty
straightforward<00:05:01.740> pretty<00:05:01.889> simple

00:05:02.899 --> 00:05:02.909 
straightforward pretty simple

00:05:02.909 --> 00:05:06.200 
straightforward pretty simple
next<00:05:03.449> part<00:05:03.720> will<00:05:03.930> consist<00:05:04.440> of<00:05:05.210> combining

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:06.210 
next part will consist of combining

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:08.659 
next part will consist of combining
motormaster<00:05:06.750> with<00:05:07.259> the<00:05:07.530> other<00:05:07.650> stunticons<00:05:08.099> to

00:05:08.659 --> 00:05:08.669 
motormaster with the other stunticons to

00:05:08.669 --> 00:05:13.249 
motormaster with the other stunticons to
form<00:05:08.940> menasor<00:05:09.740> so<00:05:11.389> that's<00:05:12.389> pretty<00:05:12.659> much<00:05:12.810> it<00:05:13.050> I

00:05:13.249 --> 00:05:13.259 
form menasor so that's pretty much it I

00:05:13.259 --> 00:05:15.860 
form menasor so that's pretty much it I
hope<00:05:13.979> you<00:05:14.099> enjoyed<00:05:14.400> this<00:05:14.610> part<00:05:14.879> of<00:05:14.970> the<00:05:15.030> review
