that<00:01:06.979> we<00:01:07.190> were<00:01:07.370> perhaps<00:01:07.579> among<00:01:08.210> the<00:01:08.960> most

00:01:09.249 --> 00:01:09.259 
that we were perhaps among the most

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:55.910 
interesting for me is that in 1986

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:58.900 
interesting for me is that in 1986
Gorbachev<00:03:56.810> came<00:03:56.840> to<00:03:57.290> power<00:03:57.530> the<00:03:58.250> danger<00:03:58.760> of

00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:58.910 
Gorbachev came to power the danger of

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:01.360 
Gorbachev came to power the danger of
nuclear<00:03:59.060> war<00:03:59.710> between<00:04:00.710> the<00:04:01.070> superpowers

00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:01.370 
nuclear war between the superpowers

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:04.270 
nuclear war between the superpowers
which<00:04:01.970> was<00:04:02.420> much<00:04:02.750> less<00:04:03.110> at<00:04:03.410> that<00:04:03.590> time<00:04:03.920> and

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:04.280 
which was much less at that time and

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.330 
which was much less at that time and
this<00:04:04.850> was<00:04:05.120> the<00:04:05.330> very<00:04:05.360> same<00:04:06.110> time<00:04:06.500> that<00:04:07.130> the

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:07.340 
this was the very same time that the

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.160 
this was the very same time that the
ozone<00:04:07.760> hole<00:04:08.060> was<00:04:08.090> discovered<00:04:08.870> over<00:04:09.020> the

ozone hole was discovered over the

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:11.380 
ozone hole was discovered over the
Antarctic<00:04:09.950> and<00:04:10.070> the<00:04:10.580> scientific<00:04:11.090> literature

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:11.390 
Antarctic and the scientific literature

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:14.470 
Antarctic and the scientific literature
began<00:04:11.930> talking<00:04:12.830> about<00:04:13.610> the<00:04:13.880> threat<00:04:14.240> a

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.480 
began talking about the threat a

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.229 
began talking about the threat a
potential<00:04:15.080> threat<00:04:15.380> of<00:04:15.560> climate<00:04:15.830> change<00:04:16.370> so

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:17.239 
potential threat of climate change so

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:18.820 
potential threat of climate change so
several<00:04:17.720> of<00:04:17.840> us<00:04:17.960> physicians<00:04:18.560> who<00:04:18.710> were

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:18.830 
several of us physicians who were

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:20.950 
several of us physicians who were
involved<00:04:19.130> in<00:04:19.460> the<00:04:19.580> anti-nuclear<00:04:20.000> physicians

involved in the anti-nuclear physicians

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:23.800 
involved in the anti-nuclear physicians
movement<00:04:21.500> started<00:04:22.400> seeing<00:04:22.760> these<00:04:23.150> global

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:23.810 
movement started seeing these global

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:25.920 
movement started seeing these global
environmental<00:04:24.350> changes<00:04:25.070> as<00:04:25.280> quote

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:25.930 
environmental changes as quote

Armageddon in slow motion and that these

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.420 
Armageddon in slow motion and that these
changes<00:04:30.410> were<00:04:30.919> much

00:04:31.420 --> 00:04:31.430 
changes were much

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:33.820 
changes were much
much<00:04:31.580> harder<00:04:31.880> than<00:04:32.210> nuclear<00:04:32.600> war<00:04:32.960> for<00:04:33.440> people

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:33.830 
much harder than nuclear war for people

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:36.650 
to grasp they were more abstract they

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:38.730 
to grasp they were more abstract they
were<00:04:36.710> significantly<00:04:37.220> more<00:04:37.940> complicated

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:38.740 
were significantly more complicated

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:41.830 
were significantly more complicated
scientifically<00:04:39.740> and<00:04:39.980> we<00:04:40.430> had<00:04:40.760> no<00:04:41.090> Hiroshima
