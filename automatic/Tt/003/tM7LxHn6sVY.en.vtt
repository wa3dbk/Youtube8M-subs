these<00:00:28.859> days<00:00:28.920> so<00:00:29.490> we're<00:00:29.699> detectives<00:00:30.240> we<00:00:30.510> find

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
these days so we're detectives we find

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.680 
these days so we're detectives we find

them we find the hard to find parts and

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.750 
them we find the hard to find parts and
we<00:00:34.320> still<00:00:34.980> and<00:00:35.130> the<00:00:35.219> hell<00:00:35.370> out<00:00:35.489> of<00:00:35.520> them

17-inch food replicas narrow front end I

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:54.770 
17-inch food replicas narrow front end I
think<00:00:50.100> I<00:00:50.280> said<00:00:50.489> that<00:00:50.520> is<00:00:50.910> a<00:00:52.309> he's<00:00:53.780> hydraulic

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
think I said that is a he's hydraulic

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.479 
think I said that is a he's hydraulic
air<00:00:55.020> displacement<00:00:55.410> system<00:00:56.190> so<00:00:56.370> as<00:00:56.460> a

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
air displacement system so as a

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.490 
air displacement system so as a
component<00:00:56.850> it's<00:00:57.270> an<00:00:57.329> absolute<00:00:57.660> nutter

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
component it's an absolute nutter

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.889 
component it's an absolute nutter
and<00:00:58.949> he<00:00:59.010> drives<00:00:59.280> everywhere<00:00:59.820> literally<00:01:00.750> an

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
and he drives everywhere literally an

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:03.560 
and he drives everywhere literally an
inch<00:01:01.050> inch<00:01:01.289> and<00:01:01.379> a<00:01:01.469> half<00:01:01.500> off<00:01:01.800> the<00:01:01.829> ground<00:01:02.570> less

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
inch inch and a half off the ground less

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.590 
inch inch and a half off the ground less
if<00:01:03.840> he<00:01:03.870> can<00:01:04.110> get<00:01:04.229> away<00:01:04.379> with<00:01:04.680> it<00:01:05.240> this<00:01:06.240> one<00:01:06.570> is

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
if he can get away with it this one is

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.090 
if he can get away with it this one is
the<00:01:06.960> latest<00:01:07.080> one<00:01:07.470> we<00:01:07.590> just<00:01:07.770> thought<00:01:07.890> it<00:01:07.979> for

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:08.100 
the latest one we just thought it for
