00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 hey people in this tutorial i show 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.819
 install you as your homebrews 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:07.350
 but before we want to know how 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:08.940
 we want homebrews installed 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.130
 probably also first know what that 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:12.540
 at all is the short explanation 

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.349
 hardly chest and programs for the 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.020
 playstation 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:18.000
 but unlike sony apps have this 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.740
 many more possibilities for example 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.840
 There are backup managers as homebrews 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.970
 or console emulators there are 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.680
 quite a few homebrews and these ones 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.269
 to enumerate all would probably be in 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.160
 short time not possible 

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:30.840
 but there are two 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.700
 different ways homebrews too 

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.739
 either you need one 

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:36.840
 ps3 the same in the same network again 

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:40.290
 computer is mostly that's that 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:43.260
 plane network and that is mostly 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:45.809
 automatically provided the playstation in the 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.890
 internet is connected like this or us 

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.160
 need for the other possibility 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.180
 just a usb stick 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.370
 we start with the simplest 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.280
 possibility of possibility with the 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.469
 we stick the first usb stick 

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.160
 quite simply an empty usb stick in 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:01.160
 the usb port 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:09.040
 then we still need logically 

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.680
 a homebrew what we want to install 

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.610
 which you have to take I give 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.800
 Do not hesitate 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:17.350
 we just have a multi here 

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:19.420
 member in the first example and pull the 

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:21.640
 pkg file just on the usb stick 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:24.310
 just in the home directory that gives 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:26.500
 no problems like that and if that is now 

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.210
 has finished copying then it is already 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.270
 the preparation of the usb stick 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.590
 completed 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:40.240
 then we pack the usb now 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:41.830
 stick in the playstation 3 purely so all 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.050
 The following steps are pretty easy 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:47.100
 because we are not on a slide here 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:49.750
 Now we have the choice whether jack 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.369
 install or delete packages 

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:54.190
 we install a package 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:55.780
 logically with packages is by the way 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:58.750
 the symbol meant to go on package 

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:02.170
 location standard package location and 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:04.420
 Now choose the pkg file from the usb 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:07.509
 stick out of which we want to install 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.830
 we wanted to install and install multi 

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:10.630
 install and in one already has 

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:12.490
 I have another usb stick 

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.849
 plugged in as the suppose described 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:15.490
 to have 

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:17.400
 but I think the basic idea is always 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:20.560
 the same 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:23.560
 Now the installation is finished and we 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:26.319
 can use multi man we also see 

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:28.430
 multi men if we go back in now 

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:31.230
 the play list 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:33.330
 so after you 've only ever seen 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.430
 with the help of a usb stick a homebrew 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.530
 I can now install you 

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.900
 show how to do it all with a ftp 

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:42.360
 client is the only requirement 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:44.790
 this is simply the one already 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:47.129
 multi mango is installed or 

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:49.170
 any other ftp server on the 

00:02:47.129 --> 00:02:50.670
 Playstation is installed so step 

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:52.890
 One thing is now logically that we 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:55.819
 start the ftp server in our case 

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.819
 this would be multi med 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.470
 Now you can under settings 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:13.299
 systems information in multimedia 

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:15.189
 Display the address of the console 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:19.120
 you have to remember them so 

00:03:15.189 --> 00:03:20.650
 She prefers to write you back 

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.909
 we now need a program on the computer 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.470
 called delay 

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:25.959
 You can find the link to it in the 

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:27.640
 Video description above in the box for 

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:31.959
 server we type the ip address of 

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:34.299
 console ie 10 216 81 78 74 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:36.400
 all other fields we leave empty and 

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:38.200
 press now also connect now can 

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.829
 We go to the file system of the console too 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.989
 to grab 

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:44.590
 we go to the fhdw 0 and go in 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:46.750
 the folder package in this folder 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:48.310
 We pull in all the car files we use 

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:50.349
 install later on the console 

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:51.970
 if we want to use wlan in the network 

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:53.670
 it takes longer in it 

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:56.170
 this is the case in this example 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:57.870
 overloaded this goes much faster like 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:04:01.359
 I've seen the retro 

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:03.010
 apk file pulled over and down in the 

00:04:01.359 --> 00:04:04.959
 We now see the progress of the 

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:07.900
 transfers and the speed of the 

00:04:04.959 --> 00:04:11.049
 transfers it to the end then it is 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:14.980
 control ready for this pkg file 

00:04:11.049 --> 00:04:16.959
 to install so now we have everything 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:19.160
 now we only have to prepare 

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:22.280
 working on the console 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:26.600
 as we know it , we open it 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:30.380
 package manager go to install and 

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:32.360
 choose ps3 harddisk this time out now 

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:33.290
 we find all the pkg files we have about 

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.660
 have pulled 

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:40.460
 also the retro art district we choose 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:43.130
 these off and they will be installed 

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:45.650
 There is much faster than using a USB stick 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:47.270
 because the pkg file is not copied first 

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:52.490
 but must be on the 

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:53.930
 console is there and see there she is 

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:56.450
 have been completely installed 

00:04:53.930 --> 00:05:01.000
 Now we can go back and circle 

00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:01.000
 they also play as a homebrew under 

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:05.570
 so much for it 

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:10.060
 See you in the next tutorial 

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:10.060
 until then keep your miss
