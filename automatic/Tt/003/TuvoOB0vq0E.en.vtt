guess it's somewhat made popular by the
price<00:00:35.820> is<00:00:36.030> right<00:00:36.059> because<00:00:36.480> you<00:00:36.660> don't<00:00:36.870> know

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960

one<00:00:57.270> will<00:00:57.480> be<00:00:57.629> worth<00:00:57.960> the<00:00:58.170> most<00:00:58.350> it'll<00:00:58.770> be<00:00:58.859> like

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
one will be worth the most it'll be like

one will be worth the most it'll be like
worth<00:00:59.219> 10<00:00:59.550> points<00:00:59.789> or<00:01:00.120> something<00:01:00.239> whatever

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:00.660 
worth 10 points or something whatever

they<00:01:01.050> wanted<00:01:01.379> to<00:01:01.530> have<00:01:01.649> and<00:01:01.920> of<00:01:02.430> course<00:01:02.460> the

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850 
they wanted to have and of course the

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.299 
they wanted to have and of course the
farther<00:01:03.149> you<00:01:03.239> get<00:01:03.510> out<00:01:03.570> towards<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.080> edges

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:04.309 
farther you get out towards the edges

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:06.950 
farther you get out towards the edges
the<00:01:05.309> easier<00:01:05.640> it<00:01:05.760> is<00:01:05.820> for<00:01:05.880> those<00:01:06.180> balls<00:01:06.479> to<00:01:06.780> you

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
the easier it is for those balls to you

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:10.039 
the easier it is for those balls to you
know<00:01:07.080> drop<00:01:07.439> in<00:01:07.710> there<00:01:07.920> so<00:01:08.220> it's<00:01:08.490> a<00:01:08.580> lot<00:01:09.049> you

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
know drop in there so it's a lot you

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:12.830 
know drop in there so it's a lot you
know<00:01:10.140> less<00:01:10.439> points<00:01:10.799> and<00:01:11.159> stuff<00:01:11.369> so<00:01:12.330> pretty

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840 
know less points and stuff so pretty

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.840 
know less points and stuff so pretty
much<00:01:12.960> this<00:01:13.170> is<00:01:13.320> the<00:01:13.439> same<00:01:13.740> concept<00:01:14.430> except

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:14.850 
much this is the same concept except

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:17.420 
much this is the same concept except
you're<00:01:15.060> driving<00:01:15.630> on<00:01:15.840> a<00:01:15.869> mongoose<00:01:16.500> and<00:01:16.920> instead

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
you're driving on a mongoose and instead

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.880 
you're driving on a mongoose and instead
of<00:01:17.549> of<00:01:17.670> course<00:01:17.909> having<00:01:18.119> a<00:01:18.270> ball<00:01:18.479> and<00:01:18.780> you<00:01:19.770> know

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
of of course having a ball and you know

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.440 
of of course having a ball and you know
you've<00:01:20.250> just<00:01:20.490> bounced<00:01:20.820> around<00:01:20.909> the<00:01:21.150> shield

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:21.450 
you've just bounced around the shield

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:24.560 
you've just bounced around the shield
doors<00:01:21.570> and<00:01:22.170> the<00:01:23.040> sinner<00:01:23.430> one<00:01:23.790> I<00:01:24.030> believe<00:01:24.299> is

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
doors and the sinner one I believe is

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.219 
doors and the sinner one I believe is
worth<00:01:24.990> five<00:01:25.409> points<00:01:25.799> and<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:27.000> outer<00:01:27.450> two<00:01:27.900> are

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
worth five points and the outer two are

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.560 
worth five points and the outer two are
worth<00:01:29.040> only<00:01:29.310> one<00:01:29.670> point<00:01:29.970> now<00:01:30.210> there<00:01:30.420> are<00:01:30.540> some

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570 
worth only one point now there are some

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.420 
worth only one point now there are some
gaps<00:01:30.960> in<00:01:31.290> there<00:01:31.470> to<00:01:31.650> where<00:01:31.799> you<00:01:31.890> won't<00:01:32.070> get<00:01:32.220> any

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
gaps in there to where you won't get any

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.490 
gaps in there to where you won't get any
points<00:01:32.700> you'll<00:01:32.909> just<00:01:33.090> die<00:01:33.270> so<00:01:33.930> try<00:01:34.259> to<00:01:34.290> aim<00:01:34.470> for

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:34.500 
points you'll just die so try to aim for

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.800 
points you'll just die so try to aim for
something<00:01:34.860> of<00:01:35.610> course<00:01:35.880> I<00:01:36.090> always<00:01:36.420> try<00:01:36.600> to<00:01:36.659> aim

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810

that and also there are a couple trolls

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:05.210 
that and also there are a couple trolls
that<00:03:03.390> are<00:03:03.570> all<00:03:03.870> my<00:03:04.050> team<00:03:04.290> sometimes<00:03:04.620> and

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:05.220 
that are all my team sometimes and

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:06.200 
that are all my team sometimes and
something<00:03:05.460> like<00:03:05.490> that<00:03:05.730> where<00:03:05.880> they<00:03:05.970> just

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:06.210 
something like that where they just

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:07.640 
something like that where they just
start<00:03:06.390> shooting<00:03:06.570> your<00:03:06.810> own<00:03:06.870> players<00:03:07.200> up<00:03:07.470> there

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
start shooting your own players up there

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.310 
start shooting your own players up there
it<00:03:08.040> won't<00:03:08.430> kill<00:03:08.670> you<00:03:08.730> but<00:03:09.120> it<00:03:09.630> just<00:03:09.810> pushes<00:03:10.080> you

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320 
it won't kill you but it just pushes you

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:11.990 
it won't kill you but it just pushes you
around<00:03:10.440> so<00:03:10.860> it<00:03:10.950> messes<00:03:11.280> up<00:03:11.310> your<00:03:11.430> shots<00:03:11.790> and

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
around so it messes up your shots and

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.240 
around so it messes up your shots and
everything<00:03:12.210> now<00:03:12.900> this<00:03:13.290> is<00:03:13.350> I<00:03:13.680> think<00:03:13.920> the<00:03:14.010> first

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
everything now this is I think the first

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.040 
everything now this is I think the first
time<00:03:14.430> I<00:03:14.550> played<00:03:14.700> it<00:03:15.120> at<00:03:15.210> least<00:03:15.360> in<00:03:15.570> this<00:03:15.690> video

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:16.050 
time I played it at least in this video

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:19.810 
time I played it at least in this video
um<00:03:16.370> so<00:03:17.370> you<00:03:17.760> got<00:03:17.910> to<00:03:18.000> be<00:03:18.120> very<00:03:18.150> careful<00:03:18.570> about

you know it starts you get it you know a
lot<00:03:32.760> easier<00:03:33.060> and<00:03:33.570> easier<00:03:33.690> and<00:03:34.050> you<00:03:34.110> start

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:38.270 
if you start you know watching how the

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:40.729 
if you start you know watching how the
mongooses<00:03:39.270> will<00:03:39.480> bounce<00:03:39.750> around<00:03:40.200> the<00:03:40.470> shield

00:03:40.729 --> 00:03:40.739 
mongooses will bounce around the shield

00:03:40.739 --> 00:03:42.650 
mongooses will bounce around the shield
doors<00:03:40.860> and<00:03:41.340> so<00:03:41.489> you'll<00:03:41.640> know<00:03:41.820> exactly<00:03:42.000> where

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
doors and so you'll know exactly where

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.860 
doors and so you'll know exactly where
they'll<00:03:42.870> end<00:03:42.959> up<00:03:43.370> so<00:03:44.370> I<00:03:44.730> know<00:03:44.940> in<00:03:45.330> one<00:03:45.600> game<00:03:45.840> I

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
they'll end up so I know in one game I

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:48.110 
they'll end up so I know in one game I
think<00:03:46.110> I<00:03:46.470> got<00:03:46.709> a<00:03:46.739> triple<00:03:47.100> kill<00:03:47.459> because<00:03:47.970> there

00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:48.120 
think I got a triple kill because there

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.390
