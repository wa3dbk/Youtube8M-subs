00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.160 
they decided to bring back Jason because
if<00:02:32.280> they<00:02:32.520> brought<00:02:32.700> back<00:02:32.760> Jason<00:02:33.209> the<00:02:33.780> ratings

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
if they brought back Jason the ratings

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.589 
if they brought back Jason the ratings
of<00:02:34.440> Power<00:02:34.650> Rangers<00:02:35.040> would<00:02:35.190> go<00:02:35.340> up<00:02:35.520> just<00:02:35.880> a

00:02:36.589 --> 00:02:36.599 
of Power Rangers would go up just a

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:39.830 
of Power Rangers would go up just a
little<00:02:36.630> I<00:02:37.050> mean<00:02:37.650> I<00:02:37.770> think<00:02:37.830> I<00:02:38.819> think<00:02:39.390> it<00:02:39.750> would

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
little I mean I think I think it would

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.839 
little I mean I think I think it would
have<00:02:39.930> been<00:02:39.989> a<00:02:40.080> good<00:02:40.319> choice<00:02:40.380> by<00:02:41.250> Ruben<00:02:41.580> a<00:02:41.610> good

00:02:41.839 --> 00:02:41.849 
have been a good choice by Ruben a good

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:43.640 
have been a good choice by Ruben a good
choice<00:02:42.090> I<00:02:42.420> mean<00:02:42.780> don't<00:02:42.959> get<00:02:43.050> me<00:02:43.110> wrong<00:02:43.260> I<00:02:43.620> mean

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:43.650 
choice I mean don't get me wrong I mean

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.309 
choice I mean don't get me wrong I mean
I<00:02:43.950> I<00:02:44.310> mean<00:02:44.940> when<00:02:45.120> Jason<00:02:45.569> came<00:02:45.600> back<00:02:46.020> it<00:02:46.200> was

00:02:46.309 --> 00:02:46.319 
I I mean when Jason came back it was

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:47.870 
I I mean when Jason came back it was
like<00:02:46.380> probably<00:02:47.250> one<00:02:47.400> of<00:02:47.430> the<00:02:47.580> greatest

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
like probably one of the greatest

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.850 
like probably one of the greatest
moments<00:02:48.420> of<00:02:48.510> Power<00:02:48.750> Rangers<00:02:48.780> ever<00:02:49.350> but<00:02:49.650> I

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:49.860 
moments of Power Rangers ever but I

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.750 
moments of Power Rangers ever but I
think<00:02:50.819> that

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:52.760 
think that

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.340 
think that
I<00:02:53.760> kind<00:02:54.180> of<00:02:54.209> wish<00:02:54.360> that<00:02:54.390> Brad<00:02:54.810> would<00:02:54.989> have<00:02:55.110> came

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:55.350 
I kind of wish that Brad would have came

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.710 
I kind of wish that Brad would have came
back<00:02:55.650> you<00:02:56.610> know<00:02:56.730> because<00:02:57.090> he<00:02:57.209> never<00:02:57.330> got<00:02:57.600> an

just three triplets lip-synching Brad
Hawkins<00:03:22.019> voice<00:03:22.260> so<00:03:23.510> and<00:03:24.510> that<00:03:24.690> goes<00:03:24.810> to<00:03:24.959> show

00:03:25.009 --> 00:03:25.019 
Hawkins voice so and that goes to show

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:30.199

you<00:03:25.200> that<00:03:26.090> Saban<00:03:27.090> really<00:03:27.950> put<00:03:28.950> more<00:03:29.250> budget<00:03:29.880> to

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:30.209 
you that Saban really put more budget to

00:03:30.209 --> 00:03:32.390 
you that Saban really put more budget to
Power<00:03:30.480> Rangers<00:03:30.930> than<00:03:31.110> any<00:03:31.290> other<00:03:31.530> project

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
Power Rangers than any other project

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:36.949 
Power Rangers than any other project
that<00:03:32.549> Saban<00:03:32.970> had<00:03:33.239> at<00:03:33.420> the<00:03:33.540> time<00:03:33.780> so<00:03:35.959> anyway

00:03:36.949 --> 00:03:36.959 
that Saban had at the time so anyway

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:39.289 
that Saban had at the time so anyway
it's<00:03:37.410> like<00:03:37.590> a<00:03:37.739> look<00:03:37.950> at<00:03:38.040> the<00:03:38.130> packaging<00:03:38.640> as<00:03:39.120> you

00:03:39.289 --> 00:03:39.299 
it's like a look at the packaging as you

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:43.130 
it's like a look at the packaging as you
can<00:03:39.510> see<00:03:39.780> it<00:03:40.440> is<00:03:41.250> the<00:03:41.400> same<00:03:41.450> packaging<00:03:42.450> as<00:03:42.750> the

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:43.140 
can see it is the same packaging as the

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:45.380 
can see it is the same packaging as the
other<00:03:43.290> super<00:03:43.709> legend<00:03:44.010> figures<00:03:44.430> although<00:03:45.359> I

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:45.390 
other super legend figures although I

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:48.170 
other super legend figures although I
don't<00:03:45.780> really<00:03:45.900> get<00:03:46.140> why<00:03:46.470> the<00:03:47.250> gold<00:03:47.489> Ranger<00:03:47.970> is

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180 
don't really get why the gold Ranger is

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:51.530 
don't really get why the gold Ranger is
in<00:03:48.480> the<00:03:48.950> Mighty<00:03:49.950> Morphin<00:03:50.160> Power<00:03:50.459> Ranger<00:03:51.150> box

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:51.540 
in the Mighty Morphin Power Ranger box

00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:54.050 
in the Mighty Morphin Power Ranger box
design<00:03:52.049> I<00:03:52.380> mean<00:03:53.280> I<00:03:53.340> think<00:03:53.549> it<00:03:53.820> would<00:03:53.910> have<00:03:54.030> been

00:03:54.050 --> 00:03:54.060 
design I mean I think it would have been

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.300 
design I mean I think it would have been
more<00:03:54.359> appropriate<00:03:54.480> if<00:03:55.049> they<00:03:55.620> had<00:03:55.859> it<00:03:56.010> in<00:03:56.100> the

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:56.310 
more appropriate if they had it in the

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:58.819 
more appropriate if they had it in the
zeal<00:03:56.609> and<00:03:57.000> the<00:03:57.420> zeal<00:03:57.630> box<00:03:57.900> design<00:03:58.320> instead<00:03:58.709> of

00:03:58.819 --> 00:03:58.829 
zeal and the zeal box design instead of

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:00.289 
zeal and the zeal box design instead of
the<00:03:58.950> Mighty<00:03:59.160> Morphin<00:03:59.340> Power<00:03:59.579> Rangers<00:03:59.760> design

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:00.299 
the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers design

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:02.810 
the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers design
I<00:04:00.329> think<00:04:00.480> that<00:04:01.140> America<00:04:01.549> thought<00:04:02.549> you<00:04:02.700> know

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:02.820 
I think that America thought you know

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:08.050 
I think that America thought you know
you<00:04:03.030> know<00:04:03.200> this<00:04:04.200> is<00:04:04.380> the<00:04:04.680> last<00:04:06.590> chaser<00:04:07.590> figure

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:08.060 
you know this is the last chaser figure

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:10.610 
you know this is the last chaser figure
that<00:04:09.060> just<00:04:09.090> you<00:04:09.510> know<00:04:09.540> just<00:04:09.840> put<00:04:10.049> it<00:04:10.140> in<00:04:10.260> the

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
that just you know just put it in the

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.789 
that just you know just put it in the
Mighty<00:04:11.040> Morphin<00:04:11.359> design<00:04:12.380> you<00:04:13.380> know<00:04:13.470> just<00:04:13.680> to

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:13.799 
Mighty Morphin design you know just to

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:15.559 
Mighty Morphin design you know just to
save<00:04:14.010> money<00:04:14.220> I<00:04:14.370> guess<00:04:14.609> I<00:04:14.730> didn't<00:04:14.940> want<00:04:15.090> to<00:04:15.180> do<00:04:15.299> a

00:04:15.559 --> 00:04:15.569 
save money I guess I didn't want to do a

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:18.759 
save money I guess I didn't want to do a
different<00:04:16.049> box<00:04:16.829> design<00:04:17.280> I<00:04:17.310> guess<00:04:17.910> so

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:18.769 
different box design I guess so

00:04:18.769 --> 00:04:21.140 
different box design I guess so
alright<00:04:19.769> let's<00:04:19.919> take<00:04:20.100> a<00:04:20.160> look<00:04:20.370> at<00:04:20.489> the<00:04:20.579> back<00:04:20.789> of

00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:21.150 
alright let's take a look at the back of

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:23.870 
alright let's take a look at the back of
