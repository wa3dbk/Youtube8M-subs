field<00:01:16.530> for<00:01:16.619> Doug<00:01:17.040> Baldwin<00:01:17.630> but<00:01:18.630> they<00:01:18.840> call<00:01:19.170> him

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:19.380 
field for Doug Baldwin but they call him

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.920 
field for Doug Baldwin but they call him
out<00:01:19.590> of<00:01:20.070> bounds<00:01:20.509> definitely<00:01:21.509> a<00:01:21.540> bit<00:01:21.750> of<00:01:21.840> a

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
out of bounds definitely a bit of a

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.330 
out of bounds definitely a bit of a
drive<00:01:22.200> killer<00:01:22.500> because<00:01:22.740> now<00:01:22.860> we<00:01:22.920> have<00:01:23.040> 21

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
drive killer because now we have 21

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.490 
drive killer because now we have 21
seconds<00:01:23.880> and<00:01:24.090> I<00:01:24.600> tried<00:01:24.869> running<00:01:25.049> a<00:01:25.200> little<00:01:25.320> bit

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
seconds and I tried running a little bit

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.410 
seconds and I tried running a little bit
of<00:01:25.619> a<00:01:25.710> halfback<00:01:25.920> draw<00:01:26.460> there<00:01:26.670> and<00:01:26.880> he<00:01:27.060> blows<00:01:27.360> it

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
of a halfback draw there and he blows it

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.630 
of a halfback draw there and he blows it
up<00:01:27.780> in<00:01:27.930> the<00:01:28.020> backfield<00:01:28.259> so<00:01:29.159> we're<00:01:29.340> gonna<00:01:29.430> play

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
up in the backfield so we're gonna play

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:30.710 
up in the backfield so we're gonna play
it<00:01:29.700> safe<00:01:29.759> we're<00:01:30.060> gonna<00:01:30.150> take<00:01:30.299> our<00:01:30.420> three

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
it safe we're gonna take our three

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.480 
it safe we're gonna take our three
points<00:01:31.110> because<00:01:31.200> we<00:01:31.320> do<00:01:31.650> get<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:31.979> ball<00:01:32.159> in<00:01:32.400> the

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:32.490 
points because we do get the ball in the

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.609 
points because we do get the ball in the
second<00:01:32.850> half<00:01:33.030> and<00:01:33.299> hopefully<00:01:34.110> we<00:01:34.290> can<00:01:34.470> make

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
second half and hopefully we can make

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.950 
second half and hopefully we can make

the board I've never seen that I've seen
a<00:03:07.990> bunch<00:03:08.440> 99<00:03:08.980> through<00:03:09.190> some<00:03:09.340> 98<00:03:09.730> 297<00:03:10.390> s<00:03:10.600> but<00:03:10.750> not

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
a bunch 99 through some 98 297 s but not

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.470 
a bunch 99 through some 98 297 s but not
all<00:03:11.140> 99<00:03:11.830> so<00:03:12.700> now<00:03:12.790> we're<00:03:12.940> starting<00:03:13.120> off<00:03:13.300> the

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:13.480 
all 99 so now we're starting off the

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.570 
all 99 so now we're starting off the
second<00:03:13.930> game<00:03:14.080> hopefully<00:03:14.739> we<00:03:15.040> can<00:03:15.160> turn<00:03:15.340> things

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:15.580 
second game hopefully we can turn things

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:17.310 
second game hopefully we can turn things
around<00:03:15.730> Alex<00:03:16.360> Smith<00:03:16.540> in<00:03:16.750> that<00:03:16.810> pistol

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:17.320 
around Alex Smith in that pistol

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:18.900 
around Alex Smith in that pistol
formation<00:03:17.530> we're<00:03:18.340> in<00:03:18.430> a<00:03:18.489> little<00:03:18.610> play-action

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:18.910 
formation we're in a little play-action

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:21.830 
formation we're in a little play-action
oh<00:03:19.750> my<00:03:19.959> goodness<00:03:20.590> what<00:03:20.860> the<00:03:21.070> heck<00:03:21.400> was<00:03:21.670> that

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:21.840 
oh my goodness what the heck was that

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:25.770 
oh my goodness what the heck was that
Alex<00:03:22.840> Smith<00:03:23.280> not<00:03:24.280> a<00:03:24.310> good<00:03:24.760> pass<00:03:24.970> I<00:03:25.239> want<00:03:25.420> to<00:03:25.570> go

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:25.780 
Alex Smith not a good pass I want to go

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:27.600 
Alex Smith not a good pass I want to go
and<00:03:25.930> sub<00:03:26.140> in<00:03:26.230> my<00:03:26.380> Tom<00:03:26.650> Brady<00:03:26.950> right<00:03:27.220> after<00:03:27.489> that

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:27.610 
and sub in my Tom Brady right after that

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:29.220 
and sub in my Tom Brady right after that
probably<00:03:27.760> not<00:03:27.970> the<00:03:28.090> best<00:03:28.120> read<00:03:28.600> by<00:03:28.810> me<00:03:29.019> but

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:29.230 
probably not the best read by me but

00:03:29.230 --> 00:03:31.320 
probably not the best read by me but
that<00:03:29.739> pass<00:03:30.040> was<00:03:30.250> about<00:03:30.430> five<00:03:30.760> yards<00:03:31.000> to<00:03:31.269> the

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:31.330 
that pass was about five yards to the

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:33.330 
that pass was about five yards to the
right<00:03:31.540> he<00:03:32.230> ends<00:03:32.410> up<00:03:32.500> scoring<00:03:32.650> two<00:03:33.070> plays<00:03:33.310> later

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
right he ends up scoring two plays later

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:35.430 
right he ends up scoring two plays later
so<00:03:34.239> we're<00:03:34.450> trying<00:03:34.750> to<00:03:34.870> get<00:03:34.930> the<00:03:35.050> run<00:03:35.230> game

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440 
so we're trying to get the run game

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:37.650 
so we're trying to get the run game
going<00:03:35.739> out<00:03:35.890> Jamaal<00:03:36.310> Charles<00:03:36.340> making<00:03:37.239> people

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:37.660 
going out Jamaal Charles making people

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:40.110 
going out Jamaal Charles making people

Miskin in the open field staying in

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.960 
Miskin in the open field staying in
bounds<00:03:40.420> look<00:03:40.870> at<00:03:40.989> Jamaal<00:03:41.350> Charles<00:03:41.820> picking<00:03:42.820> up

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:42.970 
bounds look at Jamaal Charles picking up

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:44.460 
bounds look at Jamaal Charles picking up
some<00:03:43.180> seriously<00:03:43.630> art<00:03:43.840> and<00:03:44.110> then<00:03:44.200> he<00:03:44.290> goes<00:03:44.410> for

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:44.470 
some seriously art and then he goes for

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:46.949 
some seriously art and then he goes for
a<00:03:44.709> little<00:03:44.890> somersault<00:03:45.459> after<00:03:45.850> that<00:03:46.030> so<00:03:46.720> on

00:03:46.949 --> 00:03:46.959 
a little somersault after that so on

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:48.479 
a little somersault after that so on
third<00:03:47.260> and<00:03:47.410> 2<00:03:47.530> we<00:03:47.650> give<00:03:47.799> it<00:03:47.920> to<00:03:47.980> Emmitt<00:03:48.280> Smith

00:03:48.479 --> 00:03:48.489 
third and 2 we give it to Emmitt Smith

00:03:48.489 --> 00:03:50.910 
third and 2 we give it to Emmitt Smith
goes<00:03:48.730> up<00:03:49.030> the<00:03:49.239> middle<00:03:49.510> and<00:03:49.660> he<00:03:50.260> is<00:03:50.350> just<00:03:50.650> short

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:50.920 
goes up the middle and he is just short

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:52.650 
goes up the middle and he is just short
so<00:03:51.100> I<00:03:51.160> end<00:03:51.370> up<00:03:51.459> going<00:03:51.610> no-huddle<00:03:51.880> and<00:03:52.390> I<00:03:52.450> just

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:52.660 
so I end up going no-huddle and I just

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:54.660 
so I end up going no-huddle and I just
flipped<00:03:52.810> a<00:03:53.049> play<00:03:53.320> and<00:03:53.590> it<00:03:53.890> looks<00:03:54.040> like<00:03:54.190> we<00:03:54.370> have

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:54.670 
flipped a play and it looks like we have

00:03:54.670 --> 00:03:57.360 
flipped a play and it looks like we have
it<00:03:54.910> but<00:03:55.090> Tony<00:03:55.360> Gonzalez<00:03:55.650> he<00:03:56.650> gets<00:03:56.890> beat<00:03:57.160> off

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370 
it but Tony Gonzalez he gets beat off

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:59.880 
it but Tony Gonzalez he gets beat off
his<00:03:57.820> block<00:03:58.150> so<00:03:58.959> my<00:03:59.260> opponent<00:03:59.440> kicks<00:03:59.769> a<00:03:59.860> field

00:03:59.880 --> 00:03:59.890 
his block so my opponent kicks a field

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:01.740 
his block so my opponent kicks a field
goal<00:04:00.220> takes<00:04:00.489> a<00:04:00.580> 10<00:04:00.790> nothing<00:04:00.940> lead<00:04:01.239> and<00:04:01.510> we<00:04:01.660> are
