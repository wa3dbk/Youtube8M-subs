sure<00:00:42.970> that<00:00:43.000> it's<00:00:43.240> hydrating<00:00:43.630> because<00:00:44.140> they

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:44.260 
sure that it's hydrating because they

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:45.750 
sure that it's hydrating because they
also<00:00:44.410> have<00:00:44.650> different<00:00:44.950> ones<00:00:45.100> that<00:00:45.370> are<00:00:45.460> like

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:45.760

for color-treated hair and stuff like

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:49.560 
for color-treated hair and stuff like
that<00:00:48.250> so<00:00:48.520> I<00:00:48.550> just<00:00:48.820> make<00:00:49.000> sure<00:00:49.030> that<00:00:49.180> I<00:00:49.390> always

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:49.570 
that so I just make sure that I always

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:51.810 
that so I just make sure that I always

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:16.319 
I've only found it at a beauty supply

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:19.339 
I've only found it at a beauty supply
store<00:02:16.739> so<00:02:17.010> this<00:02:17.189> is<00:02:17.340> not<00:02:17.489> as<00:02:17.760> available<00:02:18.000> as<00:02:18.569> the

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:19.349 
store so this is not as available as the

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:21.709 
store so this is not as available as the
kinky<00:02:19.650> curly<00:02:20.010> curling<00:02:20.040> custard<00:02:20.400> which<00:02:20.969> I<00:02:21.299> can

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:21.719 
kinky curly curling custard which I can

00:02:21.719 --> 00:02:23.179 
kinky curly curling custard which I can
just<00:02:21.930> find<00:02:22.049> at<00:02:22.170> target<00:02:22.200> this<00:02:22.650> one<00:02:22.859> I<00:02:22.920> have<00:02:23.040> not

00:02:23.179 --> 00:02:23.189 
just find at target this one I have not

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:25.729 
just find at target this one I have not
found<00:02:23.340> at<00:02:23.519> target<00:02:23.670> so<00:02:24.359> it<00:02:25.290> might<00:02:25.439> be<00:02:25.469> a<00:02:25.590> little

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
found at target so it might be a little

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:27.559 
found at target so it might be a little
harder<00:02:26.069> to<00:02:26.099> find<00:02:26.340> but<00:02:26.430> it's<00:02:26.670> cheaper<00:02:27.120> and<00:02:27.150> then

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
harder to find but it's cheaper and then

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:29.000 
harder to find but it's cheaper and then
the<00:02:27.689> main<00:02:27.870> difference<00:02:28.200> between<00:02:28.349> this<00:02:28.709> one<00:02:28.950> and

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010 
the main difference between this one and

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.759 
the main difference between this one and
the<00:02:29.310> kinky<00:02:30.150> curly<00:02:30.510> is<00:02:30.719> that<00:02:30.989> the<00:02:31.200> ingredients

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:31.769 
the kinky curly is that the ingredients

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:34.160 
the kinky curly is that the ingredients
here<00:02:32.040> are<00:02:32.250> a<00:02:32.280> little<00:02:32.489> different<00:02:32.900> it<00:02:33.900> does

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
here are a little different it does

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.699 
here are a little different it does
include<00:02:34.500> like<00:02:35.269> alcohol<00:02:36.290> so<00:02:37.290> that's<00:02:37.530> the<00:02:37.680> only

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
include like alcohol so that's the only

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:39.319 
include like alcohol so that's the only
downside<00:02:38.310> there<00:02:38.489> but<00:02:38.670> they<00:02:38.790> work<00:02:39.000> pretty<00:02:39.180> much

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:39.329 
downside there but they work pretty much

00:02:39.329 --> 00:02:41.599 
downside there but they work pretty much
the<00:02:39.599> same<00:02:39.810> and<00:02:40.139> the<00:02:40.709> size<00:02:40.919> of<00:02:41.069> the<00:02:41.129> jar<00:02:41.310> is<00:02:41.340> not

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:41.609 
the same and the size of the jar is not

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:43.849 
the same and the size of the jar is not
that<00:02:41.790> much<00:02:41.970> of<00:02:42.299> a<00:02:42.599> difference<00:02:42.629> either<00:02:43.079> and

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:43.859 
that much of a difference either and

00:02:43.859 --> 00:02:45.559 
that much of a difference either and
that's<00:02:44.159> basically<00:02:44.430> I<00:02:44.730> like<00:02:45.209> to<00:02:45.329> keep<00:02:45.450> it

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:45.569 
that's basically I like to keep it

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:47.479 
that's basically I like to keep it
really<00:02:45.720> simple<00:02:45.840> the<00:02:46.739> only<00:02:46.950> difference<00:02:47.189> is

00:02:47.479 --> 00:02:47.489 
really simple the only difference is

00:02:47.489 --> 00:02:48.920 
really simple the only difference is
that<00:02:47.549> if<00:02:47.790> I'm<00:02:47.909> going<00:02:48.060> to<00:02:48.150> set<00:02:48.450> my<00:02:48.480> hair<00:02:48.810> at

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:48.930 
that if I'm going to set my hair at

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:50.949 
that if I'm going to set my hair at
night<00:02:48.959> we<00:02:49.230> could<00:02:49.349> twist<00:02:49.590> out<00:02:49.799> or<00:02:50.010> a<00:02:50.040> straw<00:02:50.310> that

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
night we could twist out or a straw that

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:53.629 
night we could twist out or a straw that
