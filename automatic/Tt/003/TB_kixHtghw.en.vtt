00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:30.039 
we knew we had to take it to their files
just<00:03:28.850> 20<00:03:29.150> minutes<00:03:29.209> doesn't<00:03:29.540> he<00:03:29.660> could<00:03:29.810> get<00:03:29.930> on

just 20 minutes doesn't he could get on

00:03:30.049 --> 00:03:32.920 
just 20 minutes doesn't he could get on
top<00:03:30.260> because<00:03:30.410> of<00:03:30.680> decency<00:03:31.370> did<00:03:32.329> just<00:03:32.570> that<00:03:32.660> you

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:32.930 
top because of decency did just that you

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:34.420 
top because of decency did just that you
know<00:03:33.019> that's<00:03:33.410> lot<00:03:33.680> like<00:03:33.860> the<00:03:33.980> platform<00:03:34.370> I

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 
know that's lot like the platform I

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:36.160 
know that's lot like the platform I
guess<00:03:34.579> for<00:03:34.760> a<00:03:35.000> really<00:03:35.360> dominant<00:03:35.720> performance

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.170 
guess for a really dominant performance

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:38.800 
guess for a really dominant performance
and<00:03:36.530> a<00:03:36.560> good<00:03:36.709> one<00:03:36.860> yeah<00:03:37.310> we<00:03:37.519> wanted<00:03:38.329> another
