00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:12.330
 the bard Ã  la plancha then the garnish 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.790
 in div - dieval orange 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.520
 good there is already the label handi 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:20.610
 harassing leaf full earth that will have 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.560
 normally bitterness 

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:24.090
 so here we compress the juice of an orange 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.570
 why we knew the bitterness of 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:29.100
 endive and bring a sweetness we go 

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.910
 leave it a little firm anyway 

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.460
 endive 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.940
 just now we will realize a small 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.240
 umbrella 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:38.220
 here we are going to simmer all 

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:41.970
 slowly 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:44.670
 so the beet cooked well 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:46.280
 red is almost black there we go we go 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:51.060
 make the beet emulsion so 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:54.330
 we will cut the sugar beet cream 

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:56.520
 35% liquid cream one and salt 

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:58.770
 pepper and we will heat for them 

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.430
 traces scents the cream is what will 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.370
 to give us the following 

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:11.500
 the mules are good colors of 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:12.760
 sweets nine years ago neeve 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.740
 send it to the color there she is 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.330
 interesting in general when cooking 

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.590
 we say we always have something to his 

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:18.850
 fans at the color level 

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:21.850
 while there it stays yellow 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:24.409
 the orange allows like that to keep a 

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:25.909
 interesting visual aspect in endive 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:27.409
 so here we are we are we are we are 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:27.990
 almost good let rest a little bit 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:30.149
 the 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:33.329
 the product now so we cream 

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:35.880
 who rocked into the beet 

00:01:33.329 --> 00:01:37.079
 we will leave his side 

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.140
 during that time finally we do the 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:41.070
 beet chips a little flour 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.869
 now we are going to peel the beetroot 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.049
 she is small but she is well 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.049
 red 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.659
 here 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.880
 world all in 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:55.469
 it's very healthy 

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.530
 it is very simple look of the size 

00:01:55.469 --> 00:01:59.270
 wes impeccable 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.320
 you go small petals so here I 

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.670
 the chance to do that is a small 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:05.080
 Beet is nice if we have not 

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.390
 it is better to spend a big 

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:09.459
 beets it's a little hard but here the 

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:11.860
 cut the cookie cutter to reduce the 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:13.870
 diameter often the taste goes with the 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:14.830
 color of products if you cut a 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.330
 orange and she is all white 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.650
 inside it's rare that I have 

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.640
 a good I believe for beet 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.130
 it's a bit the same here 

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:23.440
 africa 

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:26.580
 finally let once too hot to 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.580
 around 150 degrees 

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.760
 normally they must go back already 

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:32.690
 because they will remain world it is not 

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.690
 ready to send there it's good 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:37.130
 one also combines it too hot it's 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.420
 that she will bring you the beet and 

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:40.250
 what we want precisely is that 

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:42.110
 the beetroot stays red you see 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:48.170
 that's fine we'll be able to do the 

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:50.069
 chips on is not obliged to specify 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.659
 that it is about beets 

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:53.189
 guests can wonder about the 

00:02:51.659 --> 00:02:58.319
 nature of the product here are two 

00:02:53.189 --> 00:02:59.579
 numbers we're going to filter the beet and 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:02.519
 after we will get the cream and the 

00:02:59.579 --> 00:03:04.760
 put in a siphon especially never of 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:07.829
 the piece because otherwise it will move 

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:10.500
 we pour the cream in the style must 

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:12.239
 screw on the cover before putting 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.040
 to inject the gas cartridge into the 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:14.969
 in the lid that's all going to go 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:17.579
 in a single stroke in the ain in the 

00:03:14.969 --> 00:03:19.560
 cartridge there we will hear it here we 

00:03:17.579 --> 00:03:21.900
 can check if a gas cartridge 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:24.780
 are enough we'll put some 

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:27.450
 we will increase the pressure 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:31.810
 caramelization started we will not 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:32.610
 go beyond twenty ten one deals 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:33.500
 all 

00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:35.790
 we are a beautiful color 

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:38.790
 caramelization without sugar is not a 

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:40.980
 gram of sugar dance is important 

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:43.920
 it's really orange juice and 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:46.049
 butter the ball goes to cut a beautiful 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:49.530
 share three four incisions like that 

00:03:46.049 --> 00:03:51.900
 to prevent the fish from retracting 

00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.709
 too fast in cooking 

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:54.629
 how are we going? 

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:58.980
 personally by the skin we go 

00:03:54.629 --> 00:04:03.290
 mark the cooking on the side griddle 

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:03.290
 fish powell that 's all given 

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:07.640
 do not handle it until the skin is 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:10.010
 not very well seized and otherwise the skin is going 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:13.610
 stay glued to the plate or to the 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:15.530
 trash so obviously jo but let's come 

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:17.630
 actually not been a rolling one because 

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:20.450
 otherwise we will immediately gild the skin 

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:22.790
 it will be much too fast there you 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:25.900
 see here we have the skin that starts to 

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:25.900
 take off quietly 

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:39.500
 small flora sion after flesh side 

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:43.139
 baking will finish it in the oven to achieve 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:51.629
 the training then we will come to have 

00:04:43.139 --> 00:04:55.550
 poor with the bar recovers the butter 

00:04:51.629 --> 00:04:58.300
 of orange the cry are people live 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:05:02.009
 in a glass 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:02.009
 in the inverted musso 

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:12.599
 wanted to put his little chips we see 

00:05:10.139 --> 00:05:15.460
 well the network was very tight of 

00:05:12.599 --> 00:05:17.669
 the beet issue 

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:17.669
 Yes
