00:00:12.589 --> 00:00:19.400
For years I’ve been looking for ways to track the feeding behavior of individual birds.

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.669
There's an incredible amount of information that we don't know,
even about our most common feeder birds,

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:28.799
even here in North America where
everybody’s feeding chickadees and cardinals.

00:00:28.799 --> 00:00:33.450
It’s actually really hard to follow an
individual bird over an extended period of time

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.659
and keep track of what it’s doing.

00:00:35.659 --> 00:00:42.659
And bird the size of chickadees and nuthatches are way to small
for GPS units and backpack receivers.

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:50.970
This little tag right here is a PIT tag, 
a passive integrated transponder.

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:54.780
RFID stands for radio frequency identification,

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:03.550
and this is what allows us to track the 
feeding behavior of birds in an unprecedented way.

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:11.369
I’m the Director of Project FeederWatch 
here at the Lab of Ornithology.

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:14.330
I got into ornithology because I like this,

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:19.860
I like being outside and I was
really looking for a way to get outside.

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:27.540
and to do research that was related to feeder birds, 
to answer questions that we need to know about feeder birds.

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.970
So our whole set up here is we have a PVC 
tube that contains the birdseed.

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:39.000
This bin here is a waterproof container 
that holds all of the electronics.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.270
This circle of wire here is actually the
antenna that is creating the electromagnetic field

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:47.140
that’s probing the surrounding space for
the presence of a PIT tag.

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:50.810
And whenever a bird lands on here to grab a seed,
a bird that’s wearing a PIT tag,

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.830
it will absorb  some of that electromagnetic energy

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:56.580
and send a signal back to the antenna,

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:01.280
which will then run down through this 
wire here onto our circuit board.

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:06.370
And it’s a pretty simple RIFD unit. 
It has a memory chip here,

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:09.679
and anytime a bird with a PIT tag lands on here,

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:12.479
on the circuit board we’re recording the date,

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:13.919
the time to the second,

00:02:13.919 --> 00:02:16.919
and the ID number of that bird.

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:22.269
One of the really neat things about the RIFD 
technology is that it’s been around since the 70s.

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:28.599
It’s not cutting edge technology, it’s in boxes that Walmart uses in 
distribution centers

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:31.499
that tracks the boxes, it’s in our passports.

00:02:31.499 --> 00:02:38.169
So, passive integrated transponder technology is out there.
It has widespread commercial use, which makes it cheap for us

00:02:38.169 --> 00:02:41.609
because companies are using it like crazy.

00:02:41.609 --> 00:02:45.430
When this technology came along and that light bulb went off

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:51.189
–hey, we can actually use this to understand
the behavior of the individual birds, around the clock

00:02:51.189 --> 00:02:55.480
– how they feed during the day, 
their daily patterns of foraging behavior,

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:02.159
how that changes throughout the course of 
the year, how birds switch their diet from season to season.

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:05.620
All of these questions we
can look at because of these little PIT tags

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:10.399
that we’re putting on the legs of individual birds
and tracking their individual behaviors.

00:03:10.399 --> 00:03:16.569
Live long and prosper.

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:21.459
And students really love it.

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:29.409
Change the battery…connect the circuit board to the computer.

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:31.729
4,000 hits at this one.

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:35.080
We’re tracking about 125 individual
birds of four species

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:39.170
and from those 125 birds in
the last two years we've recorded over

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:45.059
2.2 million visits to the bird
feeders that we have out in the woods here.

00:03:45.059 --> 00:03:47.479
We were blown away and thrilled

00:03:47.479 --> 00:03:51.849
with the amount of data coming in
from this really simple technology.

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:57.909
And it's open up a whole world of new
research and new avenues that we can travel down

00:03:57.909 --> 00:04:05.730
and get students involved with to learn more about 
the natural world, focusing in on common backyard feeder birds

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:11.019
which are the model 
organisms for answering bigger scientific questions.

00:04:11.019 --> 00:04:12.529
We’ll just put it back together,

00:04:12.529 --> 00:04:13.829
fill it up with seed.

00:04:13.829 --> 00:04:17.549
One of the great powers of citizen science
is that we’ve got people out there

00:04:17.549 --> 00:04:22.639
watching birds everywhere in all sorts
of different ecosystems and environments.

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:27.070
And since this technology is relatively
inexpensive

00:04:27.070 --> 00:04:30.639
and easy to use, I think we
have the potential to expand,

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:37.639
expand this research out and develop a 
network and answer some of those bigger questions.
