some<00:01:11.880> small<00:01:12.659> tubes<00:01:13.020> just<00:01:13.920> slide<00:01:14.130> over<00:01:14.400> to

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430 
some small tubes just slide over to

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:19.580 
some small tubes just slide over to

bigger ones so like this so I could

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.469 
bigger ones so like this so I could
slide<00:01:19.830> over<00:01:20.159> the<00:01:20.310> handles<00:01:20.759> I<00:01:21.000> found<00:01:21.330> myself

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
slide over the handles I found myself

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.469

some<00:01:21.869> rubber<00:01:22.080> stopper<00:01:22.860> things<00:01:23.189> so<00:01:24.119> I<00:01:24.150> put

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
some rubber stopper things so I put

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:27.200 
some rubber stopper things so I put
those<00:01:24.689> on<00:01:24.960> the<00:01:25.080> ends<00:01:25.439> I<00:01:25.619> used<00:01:26.580> two<00:01:26.820> corner

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
those on the ends I used two corner

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.810 
those on the ends I used two corner
pieces<00:01:27.680> as<00:01:28.680> you<00:01:28.740> can<00:01:29.009> see<00:01:29.189> one<00:01:29.430> is<00:01:29.549> little

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:29.820 
pieces as you can see one is little

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.609 
pieces as you can see one is little
longer<00:01:30.210> because<00:01:30.329> the<00:01:30.600> camera<00:01:31.020> is<00:01:31.049> off<00:01:31.350> balance

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
longer because the camera is off balance

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:37.940 
longer because the camera is off balance
of<00:01:31.979> course<00:01:33.049> I<00:01:35.450> use<00:01:36.450> these<00:01:36.630> longer<00:01:37.320> tubes<00:01:37.680> to

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950 
of course I use these longer tubes to

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.740 
of course I use these longer tubes to
just<00:01:38.159> cut<00:01:38.340> you<00:01:38.490> longer<00:01:38.729> to<00:01:38.850> put<00:01:39.509> them<00:01:39.600> over

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
just cut you longer to put them over

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.550 
just cut you longer to put them over
there<00:01:40.079> from<00:01:40.320> my<00:01:40.560> shoulder<00:01:41.040> air<00:01:41.220> support<00:01:42.560> put

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
there from my shoulder air support put

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.160 
there from my shoulder air support put
two<00:01:43.740> corner<00:01:44.250> pieces<00:01:44.460> at<00:01:44.759> the<00:01:44.909> end<00:01:45.060> I<00:01:45.360> thought

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
two corner pieces at the end I thought

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.249 
two corner pieces at the end I thought
that<00:01:46.409> would<00:01:46.590> be<00:01:46.619> snug<00:01:47.210> you<00:01:48.210> know<00:01:48.329> just<00:01:48.689> to<00:01:48.930> fit

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
that would be snug you know just to fit

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:52.160 
that would be snug you know just to fit

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:18.720 
quick how's this easy as you can just
make<00:02:17.200> your<00:02:17.379> own<00:02:17.409> out<00:02:17.799> of<00:02:17.980> anything<00:02:18.189> I<00:02:18.459> believed

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:18.730 
make your own out of anything I believed

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.330 
make your own out of anything I believed
in<00:02:19.200> this<00:02:20.200> is<00:02:20.349> just<00:02:20.530> a<00:02:20.620> way<00:02:20.739> of<00:02:20.769> doing<00:02:20.980> it<00:02:21.189> I

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
in this is just a way of doing it I

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.759 
in this is just a way of doing it I
guess<00:02:21.579> with<00:02:22.180> some<00:02:22.209> cubes<00:02:22.659> it<00:02:23.079> cost<00:02:23.349> less<00:02:23.560> than

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:23.769 
guess with some cubes it cost less than

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:29.539 
guess with some cubes it cost less than
five<00:02:24.010> dollars<00:02:24.810> but<00:02:25.810> that's<00:02:25.930> real<00:02:26.140> cool<00:02:27.569> yeah

00:02:29.539 --> 00:02:29.549 
five dollars but that's real cool yeah

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:32.550 
five dollars but that's real cool yeah
since<00:02:30.549> I<00:02:30.700> got<00:02:30.930> move<00:02:31.930> it<00:02:32.049> around

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:32.560 
since I got move it around

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.009 
since I got move it around
it's<00:02:33.069> way<00:02:33.489> steadier<00:02:34.180> than<00:02:34.299> holding<00:02:34.810> it<00:02:34.900> in

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:35.019 
it's way steadier than holding it in

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:39.330 
it's way steadier than holding it in
