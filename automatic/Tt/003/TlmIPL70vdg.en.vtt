it's<00:02:31.530> all<00:02:31.800> digital<00:02:32.040> so<00:02:32.700> it's<00:02:32.910> designed<00:02:33.330> for

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:33.480 
it's all digital so it's designed for

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.170 
it's all digital so it's designed for
today's<00:02:33.720> uses<00:02:34.170> and<00:02:34.650> we<00:02:35.310> made<00:02:35.490> it<00:02:35.640> reversible

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
today's uses and we made it reversible

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.890 
today's uses and we made it reversible
so<00:02:36.660> it<00:02:36.780> fits<00:02:37.020> either<00:02:37.260> way<00:02:38.030> we<00:02:39.030> also<00:02:39.210> moved<00:02:39.690> to<00:02:39.810> a

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
so it fits either way we also moved to a

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:42.770
