 Hey, Dan, delicious? 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:18.812
 I'm sorry? 

00:02:20.358 --> 00:02:22.358
 Looks pretty 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.340
 Look at it ~ 

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:29.460
 With chocolate. . . fruit. . . 

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:33.300
 And. . . Oh! It's ice. 

00:02:33.368 --> 00:02:36.168
 It's not cream, it's ice. Was good. 

00:02:36.168 --> 00:02:37.416
 Try eating 

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:44.200
 It looks like a painful face 

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:47.480
 I'm sorry 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.660
 Tooth hurts. . . Because it is sensitive 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:54.360
 Eat it ~ 

00:02:57.278 --> 00:02:59.278
 Oops 

00:02:59.278 --> 00:03:01.033
 I'm serious and clumsy 

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.980
 I ate it at the right time. The moment the child screams 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.500
 The sauce is bitter and delicious ~ 

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:15.020
 I ate everything 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.520
 Ah~! Help me~! Human being scared! 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:22.560
 I won't help you 

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:26.000
 I'm an adult. . . I played with food. . . 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.596
