00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
 good morning customers get at albert 

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:05.910
 heijn empty shelves leading up to 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:07.919
 Easter that chance is getting bigger 

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:10.170
 lead of union fnv re-launched 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.639
 tilburg for a better collective labor agreement in tilburg 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.960
 at the distribution center 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.020
 economy reporter 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.520
 raoul cartons raoul good morning yes 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.949
 remarkable situation Friday 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:25.740
 namely the other bond cnv though it 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:27.810
 ca already signed why fnv no longer 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:29.820
 sitting in the barrel is in itself a bit 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.769
 Weird that they like them together 

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:33.120
 table sits a fur or a draw and 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:34.800
 the other bomb is not but Jim already there 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.510
 will tell all about is ron 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.710
 meijer he is from fnv allies with the 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.550
 good morning girls 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.440
 yes the bone and say albert heijn 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.539
 on the table and with which 7l course is 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.000
 then it is not enough for fnv 

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:50.399
 it is true that they exist behind the people 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.440
 remember who are afraid of the 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:54.059
 sale of their permanent job and 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.340
 At the same time, Albert Heijn is doing well 

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:58.469
 makes a lot of profit everything fine 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.879
 the highest boss in 2.7 million 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:02.039
 And that's more than what it takes to 

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.449
 to allow these people purchasing power 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:04.500
 retained after wise albert heijn 

00:01:03.449 --> 00:01:05.640
 all finished 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.189
 and then you can end up after a half 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.470
 years of talking and after all other situations 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:13.080
 can't help but take action in 

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.670
 action you have been threatening for almost a week now 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.740
 indeed the empty shelves are becoming something 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.850
 he says everything runs smoothly 

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.290
 yes I do that in every hour 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.150
 say and communicate normally is 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.830
 lots of new yorks say and every hour 

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:24.210
 no dude do I left dad I get a 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.720
 buy links then I think there is something 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.710
 going on 

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.530
 and of course we know the drone to 

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:30.240
 the hand is despite that they ran on this 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.560
 strike breakers are used 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:33.150
 well they really have a problem and that 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.829
 is not necessarily something we want 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.360
 but if it can not but yes you will 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:38.070
 you just go to the genesis sheep 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.079
 on the other hand I am economically difficult 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.180
 times you may still be happy that your work 

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:44.759
 keeping a job is much more important 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.810
 then a robot definitely go that's why it goes 

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.549
 also mainly for certainty 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.070
 what is actually the most important thing 

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.509
 these people are proud of albert heijn 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.200
 but also see that in recent years 

00:01:51.509 --> 00:01:56.610
 there is a trend of uncertainty 

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:58.439
 from 20 to more than 50 percent 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:00.600
 temporary workers who work year after year 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:02.460
 working on the lowest lung for uncertainty 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.469
 that they are these people that are permanent 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:05.610
 employees under pressure and need to 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:07.530
 We really down and good shoes 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.440
 Order Albert Heijn Boer still good 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.420
 makes a lot of profit so there is no reason to 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.459
 let's say these people in the 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:16.050
 uncertainty and let alone in the cold 

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:17.610
 finally it is not going to be cozy here 

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:18.800
 your pooping the strikers are no longer allowed 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.970
 a car in the parking lot 

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.020
 drop and that will come as if 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.250
 lead to problems 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:25.230
 yes that is such a thing again 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.480
 workpace and minis and the skipping 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.190
 Harry Peakema This is the other view of it 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.360
 you could say albert heijn and that 

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.069
 You can also tell by the fact that they are 

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:34.230
 strike breakers use box fillers 

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:35.519
 from the stores that work this 

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:37.319
 people have to take care of it 

00:02:35.519 --> 00:02:38.670
 yes and that is something that he does not suit 

00:02:37.319 --> 00:02:40.530
 that typically Dutch value of 

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.000
 reasonableness and reliability of albert 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.950
 heijn but the current management is 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.900
 him another track unfortunately well it 

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:48.030
 it also animals increasingly orange 

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.310
 strikers from fnv allies ron meijer 

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:52.080
 thank you a reply at 9:30 

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.220
 by albert cha and it can also 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.959
 get a little tricky here 

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:55.980
 with all those cars when they get here 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:57.330
 parked on the road with all that 

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.739
 trucks that drive to and from 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:01.019
 in short, it will be here at albert heijn 

00:02:58.739 --> 00:03:04.670
 in tilburg no cozier on several 

00:03:01.019 --> 00:03:04.670
 about half past nine on television
