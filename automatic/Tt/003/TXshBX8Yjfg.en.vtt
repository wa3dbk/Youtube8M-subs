00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:03.899
 10 participants 

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:06.570
 perhaps a game of game currency given 

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:09.119
 garden and labeled with a special sign sees 

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:10.550

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.650
 you are familiar 

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:16.709
 entering the race itself you will see a mini map with 

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:19.110

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:22.860

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:35.130
 the race is only 1 player 

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:37.680
 the race is canceled what is actually 

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:38.850
