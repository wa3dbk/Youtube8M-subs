here in New York City I'm Brett Hamilton
and<00:00:33.270> wearing<00:00:33.809> these<00:00:33.899> headphones<00:00:34.200> will

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
and wearing these headphones will

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.770 
and wearing these headphones will
absolutely<00:00:35.520> change<00:00:35.610> the<00:00:36.180> way<00:00:36.300> you<00:00:36.360> listen<00:00:36.690> to

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
absolutely change the way you listen to

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.600 
absolutely change the way you listen to
music<00:00:37.110> and<00:00:37.260> the<00:00:37.590> reason<00:00:37.860> I<00:00:37.950> say<00:00:37.980> that<00:00:38.190> is

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
music and the reason I say that is

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.700 
music and the reason I say that is
because<00:00:39.180> I<00:00:39.480> mentioned<00:00:39.930> that<00:00:40.020> monster<00:00:40.440> built

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
because I mentioned that monster built

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.920 
because I mentioned that monster built
this<00:00:40.890> this<00:00:41.399> is<00:00:41.550> their<00:00:41.700> technology<00:00:42.300> this<00:00:42.750> is

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:42.930 
this this is their technology this is

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.869 
this this is their technology this is
monster<00:00:43.440> isolation<00:00:44.219> technology<00:00:44.730> and

00:00:44.869 --> 00:00:44.879 
monster isolation technology and

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:46.549 
monster isolation technology and
essentially<00:00:45.239> what<00:00:45.270> that's<00:00:45.539> doing<00:00:45.719> is<00:00:45.989> it's

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
essentially what that's doing is it's

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.950 
essentially what that's doing is it's
cancelling<00:00:47.160> out<00:00:47.309> everything<00:00:48.210> around<00:00:48.690> you

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
cancelling out everything around you

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.840 
cancelling out everything around you
except<00:00:49.559> for<00:00:49.620> the<00:00:49.770> music<00:00:50.160> that<00:00:50.489> you're<00:00:50.670> trying

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
except for the music that you're trying

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.819 
except for the music that you're trying
to<00:00:50.969> listen<00:00:51.329> to<00:00:51.510> so<00:00:52.020> once<00:00:52.230> you<00:00:52.379> slip<00:00:52.620> these<00:00:52.770> on

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
to listen to so once you slip these on

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.490 
to listen to so once you slip these on
they<00:00:53.820> basically<00:00:54.180> just<00:00:54.300> cut<00:00:54.690> they<00:00:54.899> form<00:00:55.260> around

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
they basically just cut they form around

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.770 
they basically just cut they form around
your<00:00:55.739> head<00:00:55.949> and<00:00:56.129> they<00:00:56.789> drive<00:00:57.030> away<00:00:57.239> all<00:00:57.449> the

00:00:57.770 --> 00:00:57.780
