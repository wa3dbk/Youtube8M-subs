the direction of the section cut so
that's<00:01:29.939> all<00:01:30.119> pretty<00:01:30.329> straightforward

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
that's all pretty straightforward

that's all pretty straightforward
however<00:01:31.110> the<00:01:31.470> problem<00:01:31.860> is<00:01:32.070> is<00:01:32.310> that<00:01:32.700> your

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
however the problem is is that your

coordinate system menu create a
coordinate<00:01:59.549> system<00:01:59.610> now<00:02:00.180> let's<00:02:00.960> say<00:02:01.140> I'm

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:01.229 
coordinate system now let's say I'm

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:03.139 
coordinate system now let's say I'm
interested<00:02:01.710> in<00:02:01.979> a<00:02:02.369> section<00:02:02.729> view<00:02:02.790> at<00:02:03.060> the

interested in a section view at the
center<00:02:03.540> of<00:02:03.570> this<00:02:04.130> bolt<00:02:05.130> I<00:02:05.659> can<00:02:06.659> simply<00:02:07.049> apply

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:07.409 
center of this bolt I can simply apply

00:02:07.409 --> 00:02:10.010 
center of this bolt I can simply apply
my<00:02:07.829> geometry<00:02:08.330> to<00:02:09.330> create<00:02:09.599> the<00:02:09.690> coordinate

my geometry to create the coordinate

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.750 
my geometry to create the coordinate
system<00:02:10.349> and<00:02:10.679> now<00:02:10.979> that<00:02:11.160> coordinate<00:02:11.489> systems

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
system and now that coordinate systems

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.520 
system and now that coordinate systems
have<00:02:11.849> been<00:02:11.910> created<00:02:12.239> in<00:02:12.300> the<00:02:12.390> center

have been created in the center

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.070 
have been created in the center
now<00:02:14.370> what<00:02:14.610> I<00:02:14.640> can<00:02:14.700> do<00:02:15.000> is<00:02:15.180> right<00:02:15.660> click<00:02:15.690> on<00:02:15.960> my

will occur on its XY plane once I create

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:30.130 
will occur on its XY plane once I create
my<00:02:26.910> section<00:02:27.480> plane<00:02:27.690> I<00:02:27.900> can<00:02:28.740> come<00:02:28.920> in<00:02:29.070> here<00:02:29.310> and

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.140 
my section plane I can come in here and

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.240 
my section plane I can come in here and
then<00:02:31.140> view<00:02:31.410> it<00:02:31.560> now<00:02:31.770> you<00:02:32.490> can<00:02:32.760> see<00:02:32.940> that<00:02:33.270> now<00:02:33.420> my

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:34.250 
then view it now you can see that now my

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.090 
then view it now you can see that now my
results<00:02:35.250> are<00:02:35.370> along<00:02:36.530> the<00:02:37.530> center<00:02:37.860> of<00:02:37.950> that

results are along the center of that

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:41.960 
results are along the center of that
bolt<00:02:39.950> now<00:02:40.950> again<00:02:41.280> if<00:02:41.459> you're<00:02:41.580> from<00:02:41.730> one<00:02:41.850> of<00:02:41.880> the

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
bolt now again if you're from one of the

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.610 
bolt now again if you're from one of the
coordinate<00:02:42.330> systems<00:02:42.630> you<00:02:42.810> can<00:02:42.930> do<00:02:43.080> much<00:02:43.290> more

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:43.620 
coordinate systems you can do much more

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.930 
coordinate systems you can do much more
than<00:02:44.720> simply<00:02:45.720> applying<00:02:46.230> it<00:02:46.410> to<00:02:46.500> geometry

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:46.940 
than simply applying it to geometry

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.610 
than simply applying it to geometry
let's<00:02:47.940> say<00:02:48.120> for<00:02:48.360> some<00:02:48.690> reason<00:02:48.720> I<00:02:49.170> wanted<00:02:49.470> to

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
let's say for some reason I wanted to

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.520 
let's say for some reason I wanted to
orient<00:02:50.130> a<00:02:50.430> section<00:02:51.000> plane<00:02:51.209> at<00:02:51.390> 45<00:02:51.870> degrees<00:02:52.290> to

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:52.530 
orient a section plane at 45 degrees to

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.010 
orient a section plane at 45 degrees to
what<00:02:52.709> it's<00:02:52.830> currently<00:02:53.250> at<00:02:53.459> I<00:02:53.700> can<00:02:54.450> again<00:02:54.720> apply

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.020 
what it's currently at I can again apply

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:57.160 
what it's currently at I can again apply
transformation<00:02:55.890> to<00:02:56.010> my<00:02:56.130> coordinate<00:02:56.489> system

00:02:57.160 --> 00:02:57.170 
transformation to my coordinate system

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.290 
transformation to my coordinate system
let's<00:02:58.170> say<00:02:58.320> I<00:02:58.380> wanted<00:02:58.620> to<00:02:58.709> do<00:02:58.830> Delta<00:02:59.280> Y<00:02:59.430> so<00:03:00.270> I

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
let's say I wanted to do Delta Y so I

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.800 
let's say I wanted to do Delta Y so I
wanted<00:03:00.540> to<00:03:00.630> do<00:03:00.780> 45<00:03:01.140> degrees<00:03:02.120> around<00:03:03.120> the<00:03:03.660> y

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:03.810 
wanted to do 45 degrees around the y

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:05.810 
wanted to do 45 degrees around the y
axis<00:03:03.840> so<00:03:04.800> now<00:03:04.890> my<00:03:05.070> coordinate<00:03:05.430> system<00:03:05.459> has

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
axis so now my coordinate system has

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:08.630 
axis so now my coordinate system has
changed<00:03:06.500> again<00:03:07.500> I<00:03:07.739> can<00:03:07.950> come<00:03:08.100> in<00:03:08.250> here<00:03:08.280> and

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:08.640 
changed again I can come in here and

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.470 
changed again I can come in here and
click<00:03:08.880> on<00:03:09.090> create<00:03:09.720> section<00:03:10.200> plane<00:03:10.440> and<00:03:11.480> now

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:12.480 
click on create section plane and now

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.590 
click on create section plane and now
it's<00:03:12.840> created<00:03:13.290> that<00:03:13.410> section<00:03:13.709> plane<00:03:13.950> for<00:03:14.190> me

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:14.600 
it's created that section plane for me

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.210 
it's created that section plane for me
so<00:03:15.600> as<00:03:15.810> you<00:03:15.959> can<00:03:16.080> see<00:03:16.140> it's<00:03:16.410> pretty<00:03:16.560> useful<00:03:16.860> for

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:17.220 
so as you can see it's pretty useful for

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:18.979 
so as you can see it's pretty useful for
creating<00:03:17.519> organized<00:03:18.000> section<00:03:18.330> planes<00:03:18.570> again

00:03:18.979 --> 00:03:18.989 
creating organized section planes again

00:03:18.989 --> 00:03:20.810 
creating organized section planes again
you<00:03:19.110> can<00:03:19.230> create<00:03:19.350> multiple<00:03:19.620> ones<00:03:20.130> like<00:03:20.370> usual

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:20.820 
you can create multiple ones like usual

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:23.720 
you can create multiple ones like usual
combinations<00:03:21.780> of<00:03:21.959> such<00:03:22.280> but<00:03:23.280> having<00:03:23.640> the

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:23.730 
combinations of such but having the

ability to use coordinate systems makes

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:26.660 
ability to use coordinate systems makes
it<00:03:25.290> a<00:03:25.350> lot<00:03:25.470> more<00:03:25.739> organized<00:03:26.190> and<00:03:26.220> structured

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:26.670 
it a lot more organized and structured

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:29.270 
it a lot more organized and structured
and<00:03:27.030> you<00:03:27.510> have<00:03:27.690> full<00:03:27.930> control<00:03:28.230> over<00:03:28.350> where<00:03:28.980> and
