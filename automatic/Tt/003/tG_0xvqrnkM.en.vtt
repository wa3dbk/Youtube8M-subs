Windows 10 considering that the specs
are<00:00:56.190> very<00:00:56.640> much<00:00:56.879> identical<00:00:57.420> in<00:00:57.840> every<00:00:58.500> way

are very much identical in every way
shape<00:00:59.550> or<00:01:00.180> form<00:01:00.390> so<00:01:01.160> that<00:01:02.160> area<00:01:02.550> should<00:01:02.609> be

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
shape or form so that area should be

and<00:03:47.830> use<00:03:48.010> it<00:03:48.040> to<00:03:49.290> get<00:03:50.290> Windows<00:03:50.620> 10<00:03:50.680> for<00:03:51.490> your

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:51.610 
and use it to get Windows 10 for your

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:54.330 
and use it to get Windows 10 for your
systems<00:03:52.060> that<00:03:52.270> are<00:03:52.390> genuine<00:03:52.900> and<00:03:53.190> for<00:03:54.190> some

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:54.340 
systems that are genuine and for some

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:57.390 
systems that are genuine and for some
reason<00:03:54.700> are<00:03:54.970> not<00:03:55.210> able<00:03:55.720> to<00:03:55.870> get<00:03:56.170> the<00:03:56.440> app<00:03:56.620> due

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.400 
reason are not able to get the app due

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:58.970 
reason are not able to get the app due
to<00:03:57.520> the<00:03:57.640> fact<00:03:57.850> that<00:03:57.970> there<00:03:58.330> is<00:03:58.420> just<00:03:58.660> a

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
to the fact that there is just a

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.470 
to the fact that there is just a
software<00:03:59.980> hiccup<00:04:00.340> as<00:04:00.490> what<00:04:00.880> I'll<00:04:00.970> call<00:04:01.180> it<00:04:01.360> in

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:01.480 
software hiccup as what I'll call it in

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:05.100 
software hiccup as what I'll call it in
this<00:04:01.630> sense<00:04:02.820> all<00:04:03.820> right<00:04:04.000> so<00:04:04.360> how<00:04:04.660> do<00:04:04.720> you<00:04:04.900> use

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:05.110 
this sense all right so how do you use

00:04:05.110 --> 00:04:07.140 
this sense all right so how do you use
it<00:04:05.290> well<00:04:05.530> first<00:04:06.370> of<00:04:06.490> all<00:04:06.550> I<00:04:06.640> want<00:04:06.820> to<00:04:06.850> say<00:04:07.000> that

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:07.150 
it well first of all I want to say that

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:08.340 
it well first of all I want to say that
I<00:04:07.210> added<00:04:07.510> this<00:04:07.630> little<00:04:07.930> line<00:04:08.050> of<00:04:08.170> code<00:04:08.320> right

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:08.350 
I added this little line of code right

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:10.110 
I added this little line of code right
here<00:04:08.560> which<00:04:08.890> is<00:04:09.040> basically<00:04:09.190> just<00:04:09.550> pause<00:04:09.760> and

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:10.120 
here which is basically just pause and

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:11.580 
here which is basically just pause and
that's<00:04:10.180> going<00:04:10.390> to<00:04:10.450> prevent<00:04:10.750> the<00:04:11.050> command

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:11.590 
that's going to prevent the command

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:16.140 
that's going to prevent the command
prompt<00:04:11.950> from<00:04:12.750> closing<00:04:13.750> out<00:04:14.250> when<00:04:15.250> the<00:04:15.760> script

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.150 
prompt from closing out when the script

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:19.229 
prompt from closing out when the script
is<00:04:16.299> finished<00:04:16.870> doing<00:04:17.140> its<00:04:17.380> dirty<00:04:17.710> work<00:04:17.799> or<00:04:18.239> its

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:19.239 
is finished doing its dirty work or its

00:04:19.239 --> 00:04:22.680 
is finished doing its dirty work or its
job<00:04:19.530> so<00:04:20.940> now<00:04:21.940> the<00:04:22.000> other<00:04:22.090> little<00:04:22.390> thing<00:04:22.600> you

job so now the other little thing you

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:23.940 
job so now the other little thing you
have<00:04:22.780> to<00:04:22.840> do<00:04:22.990> is<00:04:23.169> once<00:04:23.410> you<00:04:23.560> create<00:04:23.919> your

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:23.950 
have to do is once you create your

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:26.640 
have to do is once you create your
script<00:04:24.430> file<00:04:24.669> here<00:04:25.090> you<00:04:25.780> well<00:04:26.440> to<00:04:26.500> do<00:04:26.620> that

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:26.650 
script file here you well to do that

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:27.120 
script file here you well to do that

file as a you can just save it by click
say<00:04:46.120> 1<00:04:46.360> dot<00:04:46.630> CMD<00:04:47.320> I<00:04:47.590> put<00:04:48.430> it<00:04:48.520> in<00:04:48.580> a<00:04:48.640> location<00:04:48.940> as

00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:49.270 
say 1 dot CMD I put it in a location as

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:52.140 
say 1 dot CMD I put it in a location as
you<00:04:49.390> know<00:04:49.630> and<00:04:50.610> essentially<00:04:51.610> you'll<00:04:51.880> see

and all of your data that was in there

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:57.270 
and all of your data that was in there
you<00:04:55.390> just<00:04:55.420> have<00:04:55.720> to<00:04:55.900> essentially<00:04:56.200> run<00:04:56.470> it<00:04:56.590> now

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:57.280 
you just have to essentially run it now

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:00.180 
you just have to essentially run it now
to<00:04:57.340> run<00:04:57.790> this<00:04:57.970> what<00:04:58.840> you<00:04:58.960> need<00:04:59.110> to<00:04:59.200> do<00:04:59.350> is<00:04:59.620> do

00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:00.190 
to run this what you need to do is do

00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:01.560 
to run this what you need to do is do
not<00:05:00.310> just<00:05:00.670> double<00:05:00.790> click<00:05:01.060> on<00:05:01.150> it<00:05:01.240> because

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:01.570 
not just double click on it because

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:02.850 
not just double click on it because
that's<00:05:01.660> going<00:05:01.780> to<00:05:01.930> run<00:05:02.050> it<00:05:02.200> under<00:05:02.500> standard

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:02.860 
that's going to run it under standard

00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:04.140 
that's going to run it under standard
user<00:05:03.100> mode<00:05:03.340> you<00:05:03.460> need<00:05:03.580> to<00:05:03.640> run<00:05:03.850> under<00:05:04.000> to

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:04.150 
user mode you need to run under to

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:05.880 
user mode you need to run under to
elevated<00:05:04.570> privileges<00:05:04.690> or<00:05:05.200> as<00:05:05.290> administrator

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:05.890 
elevated privileges or as administrator

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:07.920 
elevated privileges or as administrator
so<00:05:06.130> we're<00:05:06.310> gonna<00:05:06.400> do<00:05:06.640> is<00:05:06.940> we're<00:05:07.420> going<00:05:07.600> to<00:05:07.690> go

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:07.930 
so we're gonna do is we're going to go

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:10.050 
so we're gonna do is we're going to go
ahead<00:05:08.080> and<00:05:08.380> right<00:05:08.560> click<00:05:08.590> and<00:05:09.010> click<00:05:09.580> run<00:05:09.910> as

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:10.060 
ahead and right click and click run as

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:12.750 
ahead and right click and click run as
administrator<00:05:11.130> so<00:05:12.130> let's<00:05:12.340> go<00:05:12.460> ahead<00:05:12.520> and<00:05:12.700> do

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:12.760 
administrator so let's go ahead and do

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:14.700 
administrator so let's go ahead and do
that<00:05:12.940> we<00:05:13.660> will<00:05:13.780> then<00:05:13.900> be<00:05:13.960> prompted<00:05:14.350> with<00:05:14.650> the

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:14.710 
that we will then be prompted with the

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:17.040 
that we will then be prompted with the
user<00:05:14.950> account<00:05:15.340> controls<00:05:15.730> we<00:05:16.360> click<00:05:16.600> on<00:05:16.750> yes

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:17.050 
user account controls we click on yes

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:19.560 
user account controls we click on yes
and<00:05:17.290> then<00:05:18.220> you<00:05:18.460> will<00:05:18.580> see<00:05:18.820> that<00:05:18.850> the<00:05:19.180> script

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:19.570 
and then you will see that the script

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:21.960 
and then you will see that the script
has<00:05:19.720> ran<00:05:20.020> after<00:05:20.920> the<00:05:21.100> script<00:05:21.250> is<00:05:21.430> run<00:05:21.640> you<00:05:21.850> will

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:21.970 
has ran after the script is run you will

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:24.150 
has ran after the script is run you will
notice<00:05:22.210> down<00:05:22.420> in<00:05:22.570> our<00:05:22.660> system<00:05:23.020> tray<00:05:23.290> might

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:24.160 
notice down in our system tray might

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:25.500 
notice down in our system tray might
take<00:05:24.370> a<00:05:24.400> second<00:05:24.850> for<00:05:24.940> it<00:05:24.970> to<00:05:25.030> contact

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:25.510 
take a second for it to contact

Microsoft servers but you will see that
Windows<00:05:30.450> will<00:05:31.450> essentially<00:05:31.930> activate<00:05:34.770> or<00:05:35.770> not

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:35.950 
Windows will essentially activate or not
