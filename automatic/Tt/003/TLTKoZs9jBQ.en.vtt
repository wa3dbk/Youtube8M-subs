00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.179
 hello girls today I bring you the new 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:06.450
 makeup routine that I'm taking 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:07.519
 for this heat season they are only 5 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.139
 products that I am using 

00:00:07.519 --> 00:00:12.690
 some we can get them both in 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.490
 the super in the pharmacy or we can 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:17.580
 do ourselves in our house 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:19.199
 they are low cost products that to me 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:23.490
 they have been working very well 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:25.619
 testing this routine about 34 weeks and 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.689
 it has given me very good results I hope 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:30.179
 like them and serve them and then we are going to 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:33.630
 start I'll start applying this 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:37.130
 ph balancer usually goals and what 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.130
 I'm going to apply all over my face 

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:43.090
 and I'm going to let it absorb very well already 

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:45.730
 that absorbed well the balancer I'll 

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:48.190
 to apply milk of magnesia this I the 

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:50.500
 I put in this smaller boat that is more 

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:54.570
 practical for me to have him there among my 

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.570
 things to remove it very well 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.309
 and I'm only going to apply it in 

00:00:56.999 --> 00:01:01.500
 areas where you already detected that I get 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:03.839
 more shine during the day which is the 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:09.110
 nose in front of nostrils 

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:09.110
 here on the sides and on the chin 

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.370
 just a drop 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:31.950
 yes my forehead 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.320
 and who does not forget 

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:45.060
 again he waited until he absorbed 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:49.770
 skin that dries and does not feel that way 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:51.990
 like sticky and wet 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.429
 Now what you will do is cover the 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.310
 imperfections that I have some 

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:59.630
 spots pimples I will use this 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.630
 checker of knicks 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.230
 already made the corrections I will apply 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:16.569
 the viking of meat 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:20.249
 I bought the light medium 

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:20.249
 the cock very well 

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:27.370
 I'm going to apply for points in my 

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:30.590
 I'm going to do it with my hands 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:33.099
 of brushes on this occasion 

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.099
 a little bit 

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.920
 forehead 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.340
 offers a very light coverage 

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:50.320
 but letting it dry and going back to 

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:50.320
 apply a second layer 

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:56.110
 already covers a little more 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:58.180
 then I'm just going to apply a letter 

00:02:56.110 --> 00:03:00.010
 since I finish applying I'm going to 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.900
 wait for it to be absorbed a little to 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.480
 then seal with a powder to me no 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.670
 I like it immediately after having 

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:09.190
 applied a base or a moisturizer 

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:12.370
 with color seal it afterwards with a powder 

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:14.440
 I feel that the skin is like 

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:16.780
 pasty as I do not know how the 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:19.660
 consistency of the foundation 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:21.640
 very ugly then if I say that I know 

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:23.320
 absorb better since it absorbed 

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.660
 good signal now yes they also tell me 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:28.870
 my eyebrows I will not teach with the 

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:32.580
 perfection elf complexion 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:35.590
 and I'm going to use a very loose fight 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:38.110
 I'm going to concentrate 

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:41.180
 plus the dust where I get more 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:42.860
 shine that is here on the forehead 

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:46.000
 who the nose 

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:46.000
 and the sides 

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:51.080
 and finally the chin 

00:03:54.440 --> 00:04:00.470
 there are times where I wake up with this 

00:03:57.170 --> 00:04:02.420
 part of here very red and for that it applied 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:07.220
 this powder this concealer powder 

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:11.540
 formula physicians with the same brush 

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:13.840
 the little one and only in the center of my 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:13.840
 face 

00:04:15.490 --> 00:04:18.030
 rich 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:25.960
 to post that tone a bit 

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:28.120
 reddish 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.919
 and then we go girls as they see I already have the 

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:32.319
 full makeup made my face in the 

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:34.240
 eyes on the cheeks and on the lips and 

00:04:32.319 --> 00:04:37.539
 The products that I used are very 

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:40.599
 easy to get are only four 

00:04:37.539 --> 00:04:43.090
 products is the bicrim de garnier that 

00:04:40.599 --> 00:04:46.830
 it does not offer very broad coverage 

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:49.870
 but for my needs it is very good 

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:53.400
 some girls I read and heard that 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:56.740
 they complain about smell and tone too 

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:58.830
 but the smell is very rich in fact not 

00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:01.630
 it smells nothing ugly does not exist the one of them already 

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:05.169
 I came in a bad state I do not know but it smells 

00:05:01.630 --> 00:05:08.940
 like fruits like a plant right now in 

00:05:05.169 --> 00:05:08.940
 hot weather is 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:13.570
 too liquid it gets with the heat 

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:16.840
 I have to put it in the player about 10 

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:18.910
 20 minutes for a bit is expressed 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:21.880
 because if he tried to put it like this I already 

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:24.820
 happened or is it a trail a lot comes out 

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:26.770
 of product then if you finish it for a while 

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:28.840
 to the refrigerator to improve the 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:30.970
 consistency thickens and afterwards it is 

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:33.400
 easier to use the milk of 

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:36.250
 magnesia also if you have your skin 

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:39.430
 fat or suffer from many brightness at 

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:41.200
 This will help you during the day 

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:45.070
 is going to really control the 

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:47.980
 I recommend it is very economical less than 50 

00:05:45.070 --> 00:05:50.020
 weights the pot about half a liter or a 

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:51.640
 l do not know when it will also bring 

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:54.820
 you get at any pharmacy and 

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:57.700
 ph balancer this has also made me 

00:05:54.820 --> 00:06:00.400
 liked very much already using the 34 

00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:02.680
 weeks I do not know how much and if you do not have 

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:04.990
 chance and you to get it or not what 

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:07.480
 they sell in your city â€‹â€‹it can not be 

00:06:04.990 --> 00:06:10.480
 homemade way using water from 

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:12.970
 witch hazel and rose water 

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:16.330
 little boats these have this 

00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:19.720
 Atomizer you already throw it out and you already have your 

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:21.640
 balancer in your house and the powders 

00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:24.910
 also texts already spoken many times 

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:27.700
 in some videos it is an excellent powder 

00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:31.780
 to keep the skin mass during 

00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:35.020
 the day does not add color if you put on 

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:36.760
 too much your face is whitish and 

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:38.650
 it goes to any skin color unless 

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:41.080
 that you are very dark and if you do not 

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:43.720
 I recommend but those that have the skin and 

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:45.940
 clear media there if it does not give you any 

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:47.710
 inconvenient if you're going to apply the 

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:50.440
 bicrim that does not offer coverage 

00:06:47.710 --> 00:06:53.620
 very broad and you need more coverage 

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:55.870
 because you have another g6 granites and several 

00:06:53.620 --> 00:06:59.260
 imperfections can replace it with a 

00:06:55.870 --> 00:07:01.630
 dust that also thematic and that a 

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:03.970
 normal compact makeup powder and already 

00:07:01.630 --> 00:07:05.500
 arranged business and fewer girls with this 

00:07:03.970 --> 00:07:08.110
 we finished the video I hope there was 

00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:09.790
 liked any question 

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:11.350
