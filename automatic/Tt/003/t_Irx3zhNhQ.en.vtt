00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:14.989
 hello people from a campsite welcome and also because many people there see 

00:00:14.989 --> 00:00:17.390
 explain that I am a real name of the square 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:20.770
 and today I have a guest appearance of the first major role 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:24.140
 I have never prepared other videos for others 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:25.410
 you can improve 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:28.930
 and today have questions about vacations vacation owner 

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:30.449
 to be specific 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.100
 I'm not going to talk about my vacation a bit Monday 

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.500
 what are really incredibly happy holidays because in general it is often 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.800
 if incredibly nice it is a time where you can just lay can relax 

00:00:40.319 --> 00:00:41.690
 just a little can do nothing 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.780
 the beautiful exotic countries can go on holiday 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.210
 and just have fun, it is fine if you stay at home 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.720
 or just make lots of great vacation friends on vacation 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:52.819
 killed boys 

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:54.829
 new special places known 

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:55.719
 and as usual 

00:00:55.719 --> 00:00:58.809
 nice violence from vacation but unfortunately there is also 

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:01.460
 the bad part of a vacation 

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:05.479
 were his meanwhile fighting sections i will speak egypt from experience 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.119
 and some things to take and very weak performance so anp actually vacation 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:13.920
 and lack in the race for the investigation 

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:19.299
 it is first to be sick because being sick it is incredibly sour on holiday 

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:23.209
 if you are sick on vacation and I think that once experienced one 

00:01:23.209 --> 00:01:24.030
 structure 

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.230
 and she goes to a country you go a vacation maybe I go 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:31.240
 on vacation Netherlands that goes away with the idea to do fun things 

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.259
 and if you can't get there then 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:35.190
 and you are sick 

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.900
 the hands full to due can do very little 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.390
 if you are really very ill 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:41.660
 then you just have to stay home and rest 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:44.060
 if you are not clear if the man want to do something 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:45.790
 you can do most things in the normal way 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:48.960
 but if you are very content when you have broken your leg you can for example 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:49.579
 not 

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:54.719
 we go after the muscles or you can not in how can that of purple have a big chance 

00:01:54.719 --> 00:01:58.320
 has said incredibly bold if your example can do a fun activity 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.380
 and if you are sick 

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.039
 Kagan doing lesser things my dad was up on holiday 

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:05.380
 the Alps were the reactions 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:07.450
 across the netherlands the name as that 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:09.119
 megan vacation 

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.180
 and always have to rest 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.010
 when those on vacation or as to take and become 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.559
 but we actually only sat at the hotel 

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:20.490
 and actually did nothing, we are actually going to count down a few days 

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:21.660
 then start with the 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:26.050
 the went to lunch committed to samas unparalleled to look up 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.359
 hospitals there in turkey 

00:02:28.359 --> 00:02:31.459
 then we went back to bed, just waiting to see how much pain I returned home 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:32.179
 used to go 

00:02:32.179 --> 00:02:34.170
 and that is a bit of sunshine than for a vacation 

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:36.739
 And you also don't really have a nice vacation and money 

00:02:36.739 --> 00:02:38.299
 but yes that would be a shame 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:41.489
 it is also the end when you are sick also does a kia says it says 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:42.359
 reynders 

00:02:42.359 --> 00:02:45.769
 have been going on for years on the next worse and is and that is 

00:02:45.769 --> 00:02:50.700
 if you are very sorry and yes the parents of the parents and that is not really a bad thing 

00:02:50.699 --> 00:02:51.699
 many people have 

00:02:51.699 --> 00:02:55.039
 it's more that he is something personal and just comes that 

00:02:55.039 --> 00:02:57.989
 Audi is making everything so big a problem 

00:02:57.989 --> 00:03:01.070
 and maybe it's because I'm finally in puberty a bit 

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:04.120
 press ben as a teenager it could very well be people 

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.440
 I am a real easiest to clean up 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:08.479
 to travel when I am with the parents 

00:03:08.479 --> 00:03:10.409
 it's more just being older 

00:03:10.409 --> 00:03:12.749
 which makes me be there but as a big point and 

00:03:12.749 --> 00:03:16.319
 also for example if there is then you will do it completely if it is such 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:18.369
 big problem is going to be like me 

00:03:18.369 --> 00:03:21.619
 just go traveling and watch it just a little quietly thinking about you 

00:03:21.619 --> 00:03:23.540
 van ark bargain prices I'm leaving 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:26.150
 I go by car there and there one so late 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:27.270
 and everything at ease 

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:28.930
 then everything goes much quieter 

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:30.580
 because for example there were 

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:32.409
 how went to venice 

00:03:32.409 --> 00:03:33.570
 we went back 

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:35.189
 the end went by taxi 

00:03:35.189 --> 00:03:38.399
 people who were susceptible six points ahead of the airport 

00:03:38.399 --> 00:03:42.129
 then you have to make 16 hours at an airport which is also extremely annoying 

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:45.409
 good that you are the next challenge 

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:49.299
 and that is in fact a delay and also a bit of gray in itself 

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:51.479
 not bad because I already know a lot about the unique band 

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:54.549
 an end to a disappointment 

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:56.219
 making a cell embedded 

00:03:56.219 --> 00:03:58.439
 to watch that price of movies 

00:03:58.439 --> 00:04:01.450
 or i just go to my family this that the buoy in which she wants 

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:03.930
 only i expected that so jan n 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:06.319
 I just think it's a shame at six o'clock 

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:10.479
 six hours to follow at an airport and that of Jan and then you have too 

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:12.089
 just a little bit the daughter 

00:04:12.089 --> 00:04:13.759
 but yes and the other 

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:17.059
 yes ashton took the chance so the delay is delayed 

00:04:17.059 --> 00:04:19.139
 wait is really bad 

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:20.729
 and surprise you have to wait 

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:24.849
 in the room where you arrive at the airport planes landed 

00:04:24.849 --> 00:04:27.800
 you just have at the airport you can just do all the nice things that i do 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.680
 can imagine is a time that i have different from others most you have anywhere 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.240
 with a burger king below 

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.270
 like starbucks in another group 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:38.110
 I have the store where you can just put life 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:39.780
 actually i can relax 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.770
 but if you go to the pit lane 

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:43.969
 then you are a bit in the ed 

00:04:43.969 --> 00:04:45.830
 enjoyed the airport in real life 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:49.110
 logically that happened from before made 

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:52.860
 And then you get a little bored because then it is like if you have delays 

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:56.729
 two hours or so I can't go back because you're dead part where you 

00:04:56.729 --> 00:04:58.020
 actually already 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:01.499
 yes what actually no longer someone with a handed out to think then his son 

00:05:01.499 --> 00:05:02.919
 this gave it to assume 

00:05:02.919 --> 00:05:04.520
 moreover knew the knee 

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:08.309
 he doesn't care about street coaches but yes and the fights 

00:05:08.309 --> 00:05:09.969
 and I think that's a shame because 

00:05:09.969 --> 00:05:13.389
 then you sit a bit behind the watch looking at the clock and on one 

00:05:13.389 --> 00:05:16.159
 given time there the things respond 

00:05:16.159 --> 00:05:19.860
 yes we own the phone it seems legia it's a bit too much 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:21.790
 surrounded by gymnastics that was 16 years old 

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:22.780
 when I was six o'clock 

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:25.330
 too early was anp the airport of the island 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:29.020
 little bit and also stands on a toddler who has an atmosphere of italy 

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:33.720
 small airport just like support first gets one of the better airports 

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:35.159
 where I have ever been is just 

00:05:35.159 --> 00:05:37.610
 the best that have been common 

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:39.659
 3 Schiphol heavy boy airport 

00:05:39.659 --> 00:05:43.749
 Eindhoven on the other hand is a bit of a small airport 

00:05:43.749 --> 00:05:45.979
 it was a little bit of ali albert 

00:05:45.979 --> 00:05:47.089
 he came to more 

00:05:47.089 --> 00:05:49.370
 it was a small airport 

00:05:49.370 --> 00:05:50.499
 a long 

00:05:50.499 --> 00:05:56.300
 quite appealing and it was a pizza hut but not everyone was fed up 

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:58.150
 which made me very busy there 

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:01.220
 and I surrounded two thing after nine rounds of calling I saw a woman 

00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:06.460
 The ones he thought were there when they were in the act of serving our users 

00:06:06.460 --> 00:06:09.330
 and i thought i just go when you walk there i will pretend they stink 

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:10.990
 the guarantee of 20 

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:12.240
 al jazeera 

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:14.280
 and not like a basket on Tuesday 

00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:16.879
 I had a lot of stupid things to do if you want to believe 

00:06:16.879 --> 00:06:19.110
 we wait as really awful 

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:22.590
 and the parents of the parents makers as a problem but if behind it 

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:23.589
 the responses 

00:06:23.589 --> 00:06:26.860
 what that is your biggest annoyance of vacation we are of course incredibly 

00:06:26.859 --> 00:06:27.830
 lots of fun things 

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:31.080
 and that is also what holidays are all about 

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:34.850
 because even eleven o'clock when the hotel is a bit disappointing as really very high 

00:06:34.849 --> 00:06:35.750
 had expectations 

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:37.759
 for example if you have that one for cooling 

00:06:37.759 --> 00:06:41.480
 all around super de luxe fifteen new star hotel 

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:43.650
 to have been in for weeks on a daily basis 

00:06:43.650 --> 00:06:45.820
 would soon be included 

00:06:45.820 --> 00:06:46.689
 and 

00:06:46.689 --> 00:06:48.879
 then it turns out it's a miracle time 

00:06:48.879 --> 00:06:50.620
 hotel to be with 

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:51.610
 lots of cockroaches 

00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:56.110
 that will be a pity yes it is almost over later I liked kart racing 

00:06:56.110 --> 00:07:00.160
 knocked down on a thinker next to yes if you liked the movie is good 

00:07:00.159 --> 00:07:02.280
 and take a look at my chin at the divorce 

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:04.229
 I'm 26 March too 

00:07:04.229 --> 00:07:07.400
 I got this on my hands I never really thought about it I got it 

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:09.050
 always about something a bit 

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:12.610
 The most popular news a bit about if you are about myself yes I think little 

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:15.840
 but i hope i will refer to it a bit upstairs when 

00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:19.440
 so if you got that game aegon soon passed so yes look at my chin 

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:21.020
 to the divorce also briefly 

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:22.759
 Rome still thank you for the help needed 

00:07:22.759 --> 00:07:24.099
 some rise 

00:07:24.099 --> 00:07:26.689
 after growth 

00:07:26.689 --> 00:07:27.719
 yes that was tame 

00:07:27.719 --> 00:07:30.620
 and I say we have a nice CAO and I say let it
