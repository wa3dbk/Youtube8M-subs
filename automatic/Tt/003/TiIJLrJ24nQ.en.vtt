in the early days of stolen flying there

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.730 
in the early days of stolen flying there
was<00:00:27.029> the<00:00:27.180> Harrier<00:00:27.480> but<00:00:27.840> it<00:00:27.930> was<00:00:28.050> very<00:00:28.289> work

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
was the Harrier but it was very work

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.070 
was the Harrier but it was very work

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:45.540 
the integration of the two is really

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.170 
the integration of the two is really
what's<00:00:45.720> made<00:00:45.930> this<00:00:46.110> possible<00:00:46.409> in<00:00:47.400> the<00:00:47.580> f-35

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
what's made this possible in the f-35

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.060 
what's made this possible in the f-35
the<00:00:48.570> way<00:00:48.690> the<00:00:48.780> pilot<00:00:49.080> controls<00:00:49.440> his<00:00:49.620> height<00:00:49.830> is

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
the way the pilot controls his height is

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.340 
the way the pilot controls his height is
with<00:00:50.489> his<00:00:50.610> right<00:00:50.850> hand<00:00:51.000> is<00:00:51.269> stick<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:52.110> same

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
with his right hand is stick the same

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.110 
with his right hand is stick the same
way<00:00:52.559> at<00:00:52.769> zero<00:00:53.070> knots<00:00:53.309> as<00:00:53.519> he<00:00:53.610> does<00:00:53.790> at<00:00:53.909> five

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:54.120 
way at zero knots as he does at five

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.270 
way at zero knots as he does at five
hundred<00:00:54.449> knots<00:00:54.629> pushed<00:00:55.440> forward<00:00:55.860> you<00:00:55.949> go<00:00:56.070> down

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
hundred knots pushed forward you go down

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.160 
hundred knots pushed forward you go down
and<00:00:56.430> pull<00:00:56.580> back<00:00:56.760> to<00:00:56.970> go<00:00:57.089> up<00:00:57.269> so<00:00:57.900> it's<00:00:58.019> all

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
and pull back to go up so it's all

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.259 
and pull back to go up so it's all
consistent<00:00:58.650> learning<00:00:59.040> but<00:00:59.640> the<00:00:59.729> important

00:01:00.259 --> 00:01:00.269 
consistent learning but the important

00:01:00.269 --> 00:01:02.210 
consistent learning but the important
thing<00:01:00.420> is<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.780> pilot<00:01:01.140> if<00:01:01.229> he<00:01:01.350> just<00:01:01.500> lets<00:01:02.010> go

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:02.220 
thing is the pilot if he just lets go

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:03.560 
thing is the pilot if he just lets go
the<00:01:02.400> stick<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.790> airplane<00:01:03.089> will<00:01:03.210> stay<00:01:03.390> where

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
the stick the airplane will stay where

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.149 
the stick the airplane will stay where
it<00:01:03.659> is<00:01:03.720> the<00:01:03.930> Harrier<00:01:04.229> doesn't<00:01:04.559> do<00:01:04.680> that<00:01:04.860> it

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:05.159 
it is the Harrier doesn't do that it

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.070 
it is the Harrier doesn't do that it
requires<00:01:05.909> constant<00:01:06.330> attention<00:01:06.450> to<00:01:06.840> stay

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
requires constant attention to stay

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.160 
requires constant attention to stay
there

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.170 

as<00:01:10.650> you<00:01:10.890> look<00:01:11.040> at<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.280> video<00:01:11.520> of<00:01:11.820> Graham

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
as you look at the video of Graham

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.789 
as you look at the video of Graham
Tomlinson<00:01:12.750> coming<00:01:13.049> in<00:01:13.200> to<00:01:13.380> do<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.619> first

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
Tomlinson coming in to do the first

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.609 
Tomlinson coming in to do the first
vertical<00:01:14.070> landing<00:01:14.520> you<00:01:15.270> notice<00:01:15.630> what<00:01:16.380> looks

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
vertical landing you notice what looks

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.679 
vertical landing you notice what looks
almost<00:01:16.830> like<00:01:17.159> graty's<00:01:17.909> and<00:01:18.210> in<00:01:18.299> fact<00:01:18.540> that's

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:18.689 
almost like graty's and in fact that's

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:20.270 
almost like graty's and in fact that's
what<00:01:18.840> Graham<00:01:19.080> said<00:01:19.380> it<00:01:19.470> was<00:01:19.649> was<00:01:19.860> very<00:01:20.070> easy

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
what Graham said it was was very easy

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.249 
what Graham said it was was very easy
we'd<00:01:21.119> worked<00:01:21.360> very<00:01:21.570> hard<00:01:21.630> to<00:01:21.930> make<00:01:22.080> that

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
we'd worked very hard to make that

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:22.820 
we'd worked very hard to make that
happen

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:22.830 
happen

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.560 
happen
conventional<00:01:23.700> airplanes<00:01:24.030> when<00:01:24.180> you<00:01:24.270> come<00:01:24.420> in

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570 
conventional airplanes when you come in

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.060 
conventional airplanes when you come in
there'd<00:01:24.720> be<00:01:24.780> a<00:01:24.840> great<00:01:25.080> deal<00:01:25.259> of<00:01:25.290> wondering

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
there'd be a great deal of wondering

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.130 
there'd be a great deal of wondering
about<00:01:26.479> positioning<00:01:27.479> and<00:01:27.659> those<00:01:27.840> type<00:01:28.110> of

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
about positioning and those type of

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.289 
about positioning and those type of
things<00:01:28.590> and<00:01:28.789> controlling<00:01:29.789> the<00:01:29.850> hover<00:01:30.030> very

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
things and controlling the hover very

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:33.200 
things and controlling the hover very
precisely<00:01:30.720> well<00:01:31.320> with<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.560> f-35<00:01:32.190> because<00:01:33.060> the

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
precisely well with the f-35 because the

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.960 
precisely well with the f-35 because the
integrated<00:01:33.630> flight<00:01:33.780> propulsion<00:01:34.409> system<00:01:35.310> it

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
integrated flight propulsion system it

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.850 
integrated flight propulsion system it
it<00:01:36.509> was<00:01:36.630> very<00:01:36.840> easy<00:01:37.080> the<00:01:37.350> system<00:01:37.680> is<00:01:37.740> doing

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:37.860 
it was very easy the system is doing

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.620 
it was very easy the system is doing
most<00:01:38.189> of<00:01:38.310> the<00:01:38.369> hard<00:01:38.549> work<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:38.939> pilots<00:01:39.330> simply

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
most of the hard work the pilots simply

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.730 
most of the hard work the pilots simply
making<00:01:39.960> a<00:01:40.049> decision<00:01:40.320> where<00:01:40.649> he<00:01:40.740> wants<00:01:41.009> to<00:01:41.039> go

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:42.740 
making a decision where he wants to go

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.930 
making a decision where he wants to go
you<00:01:43.740> know<00:01:43.830> one<00:01:44.009> of<00:01:44.100> the<00:01:44.159> truly<00:01:44.369> incredible

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:44.940 
you know one of the truly incredible

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:47.090 
you know one of the truly incredible
things<00:01:45.149> about<00:01:45.330> our<00:01:45.630> stovall<00:01:46.170> airplane<00:01:46.560> is

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
things about our stovall airplane is

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.740 
things about our stovall airplane is
that<00:01:47.369> its<00:01:47.520> first<00:01:47.729> actually<00:01:48.270> a<00:01:48.299> combat

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
that its first actually a combat

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.050 
that its first actually a combat
aircraft<00:01:49.140> it<00:01:49.830> has<00:01:50.009> the<00:01:50.159> full<00:01:50.340> capability
