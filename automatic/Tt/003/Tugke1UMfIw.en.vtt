hey guys welcome back to let's play
Adventure<00:00:04.049> Island<00:00:04.170> -<00:00:04.790> it's<00:00:05.790> time<00:00:05.940> for<00:00:06.000> cloud

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:06.420 
Adventure Island - it's time for cloud

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.960 
Adventure Island - it's time for cloud
island<00:00:06.690> and<00:00:07.049> despite<00:00:07.500> its<00:00:07.680> name<00:00:07.859> it's<00:00:08.790> not

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
island and despite its name it's not

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:12.110 
island and despite its name it's not
made<00:00:09.150> out<00:00:09.179> of<00:00:09.360> clothes<00:00:10.580> it's<00:00:11.580> kind<00:00:11.790> of<00:00:11.849> a<00:00:11.940> long

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120 
made out of clothes it's kind of a long

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.980 
made out of clothes it's kind of a long
island<00:00:12.360> so<00:00:12.719> I<00:00:12.780> expect<00:00:13.200> this<00:00:13.380> to<00:00:13.590> run<00:00:13.769> to<00:00:14.250> videos

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:14.990 
island so I expect this to run to videos

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:18.710 
island so I expect this to run to videos
so<00:00:15.990> let's<00:00:16.109> split<00:00:16.260> it<00:00:16.379> in<00:00:16.470> half<00:00:16.500> and<00:00:17.480> watch<00:00:18.480> both

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:18.720 
so let's split it in half and watch both

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:23.090 
so let's split it in half and watch both
of<00:00:18.750> them<00:00:20.119> over<00:00:21.119> all<00:00:21.390> the<00:00:21.539> cloud<00:00:21.980> aspects<00:00:22.980> is

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.100

level aren't that bad it's just more
hints<00:00:26.430> of<00:00:26.550> death<00:00:26.820> and<00:00:27.090> usual<00:00:27.990> it's<00:00:28.140> not<00:00:28.260> that

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:28.410 
hints of death and usual it's not that

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.260 
hints of death and usual it's not that
bad<00:00:29.990> if<00:00:30.990> anything<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:31.500> regular<00:00:31.830> islands

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:32.270 
bad if anything the regular islands

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:34.459 
bad if anything the regular islands
regular<00:00:33.270> areas<00:00:33.660> of<00:00:33.780> this<00:00:33.870> island<00:00:34.079> have<00:00:34.320> been<00:00:34.440> a

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
regular areas of this island have been a

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:35.530 
regular areas of this island have been a
big<00:00:34.680> problem<00:00:34.829> for<00:00:35.070> me

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:35.540 
big problem for me

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.110 
big problem for me
although<00:00:36.540> I<00:00:36.840> think<00:00:37.170> I<00:00:37.559> could<00:00:37.800> safely<00:00:38.520> say<00:00:38.910> all

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
although I think I could safely say all

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.790 
although I think I could safely say all
the<00:00:39.239> mistakes<00:00:39.600> and<00:00:39.780> deaths<00:00:40.020> I've<00:00:40.200> been<00:00:40.350> having

the mistakes and deaths I've been having

recording to this work pretty much all

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.080 
recording to this work pretty much all
my<00:00:45.750> fault<00:00:46.050> either<00:00:46.320> for<00:00:47.219> not<00:00:47.340> paying<00:00:47.550> attention

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
my fault either for not paying attention

my fault either for not paying attention
or<00:00:48.210> not<00:00:48.239> reacting<00:00:48.809> fast<00:00:49.050> enough<00:00:49.350> so<00:00:50.030> hopefully

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
or not reacting fast enough so hopefully

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.520 
or not reacting fast enough so hopefully
this<00:00:51.239> time<00:00:51.420> it<00:00:51.629> will<00:00:51.690> be<00:00:51.750> it<00:00:51.989> and<00:00:52.199> I<00:00:52.260> can<00:00:52.379> get

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
this time it will be it and I can get

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.140 
this time it will be it and I can get
through<00:00:52.739> it

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:54.150 
through it

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.000 
through it
I'm<00:00:54.720> getting<00:00:54.990> tired<00:00:55.230> of<00:00:55.380> this<00:00:55.440> island<00:00:55.710> now

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
I'm getting tired of this island now

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.010 
I'm getting tired of this island now
although<00:00:56.490> again<00:00:56.970> it's<00:00:57.150> not<00:00:57.270> as<00:00:57.420> bad<00:00:57.570> as<00:00:57.720> km

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
although again it's not as bad as km

00:00:58.020 --> 00:00:58.630 
although again it's not as bad as km
island

00:00:58.630 --> 00:00:58.640 
island

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:04.810 
island
saw<00:00:59.240> me<00:00:59.570> making<00:00:59.930> mistakes<00:01:03.250> the<00:01:04.250> water<00:01:04.460> level

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:04.820 
saw me making mistakes the water level

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.690 
saw me making mistakes the water level
and<00:01:04.879> this<00:01:05.030> one<00:01:05.239> is<00:01:05.360> a<00:01:05.390> bit<00:01:05.630> harder<00:01:06.130> because<00:01:07.130> you

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:07.700 
and this one is a bit harder because you

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.270 
and this one is a bit harder because you
really<00:01:07.880> don't<00:01:08.060> get<00:01:08.150> that<00:01:08.360> much<00:01:08.540> time<00:01:08.890> and<00:01:09.890> you

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:10.280 
really don't get that much time and you

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:11.920 
really don't get that much time and you
have<00:01:10.430> to<00:01:10.550> slow<00:01:10.820> down<00:01:10.850> at<00:01:11.270> a<00:01:11.330> few<00:01:11.480> points<00:01:11.690> and

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:11.930 
have to slow down at a few points and

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:15.850 
have to slow down at a few points and
wait<00:01:12.260> and<00:01:13.840> it's<00:01:14.840> not<00:01:14.960> very<00:01:15.140> easy<00:01:15.350> to<00:01:15.440> do<00:01:15.620> on<00:01:15.650> the

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:15.860 
wait and it's not very easy to do on the

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:17.050 
wait and it's not very easy to do on the
water<00:01:16.070> Higgins

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:17.060 
water Higgins

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.750 
water Higgins
on<00:01:17.450> his<00:01:17.720> own<00:01:17.870> it's<00:01:18.170> not<00:01:18.320> that<00:01:18.500> bad<00:01:18.760> because

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:19.760 
on his own it's not that bad because

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.230 
on his own it's not that bad because
he's<00:01:20.000> already<00:01:20.210> slow<00:01:21.370> but<00:01:22.370> the<00:01:22.820> Dimond

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:23.240 
he's already slow but the Dimond

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.010 
he's already slow but the Dimond
elasmosaurus<00:01:23.510> guy<00:01:24.380> here<00:01:25.240> he<00:01:26.240> doesn't<00:01:26.600> slow

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:27.020 
elasmosaurus guy here he doesn't slow

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:28.690 
elasmosaurus guy here he doesn't slow
down<00:01:27.050> very<00:01:27.470> well<00:01:27.650> he<00:01:27.920> kind<00:01:28.130> of<00:01:28.250> glides<00:01:28.520> through

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:28.700 
down very well he kind of glides through

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.490 
down very well he kind of glides through
the<00:01:28.820> water<00:01:29.090> he<00:01:29.390> has<00:01:29.510> a<00:01:29.540> lot<00:01:29.750> of<00:01:29.870> momentum<00:01:30.140> when

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:30.500 
the water he has a lot of momentum when

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:31.980 
the water he has a lot of momentum when
he's<00:01:30.619> going

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:31.990 
he's going

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:34.109 
he's going
so<00:01:32.260> it<00:01:32.680> makes<00:01:32.920> it<00:01:33.130> harder<00:01:33.370> to<00:01:33.490> stop<00:01:33.760> and<00:01:34.030> it

00:01:34.109 --> 00:01:34.119 
so it makes it harder to stop and it

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:37.350 
so it makes it harder to stop and it
makes<00:01:34.270> it<00:01:34.390> hard<00:01:34.540> to<00:01:34.659> get<00:01:34.750> going<00:01:35.140> too<00:01:36.270> it's<00:01:37.270> the

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:37.360 
makes it hard to get going too it's the

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:38.609 
makes it hard to get going too it's the
same<00:01:37.540> problem<00:01:37.810> you<00:01:38.020> have<00:01:38.170> if<00:01:38.380> you<00:01:38.500> use

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:38.619 
same problem you have if you use

00:01:38.619 --> 00:01:41.280 
same problem you have if you use
pterodactyl<00:01:39.369> really<00:01:39.700> it's<00:01:39.880> just<00:01:40.229> during<00:01:41.229> the

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:41.290 
pterodactyl really it's just during the

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:46.140 
pterodactyl really it's just during the
water<00:01:41.500> rather<00:01:41.770> than<00:01:41.890> the<00:01:42.070> sky<00:01:44.820> it's<00:01:45.820> a<00:01:45.880> spot

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:46.150 
water rather than the sky it's a spot

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:48.830 
water rather than the sky it's a spot
coming<00:01:46.390> upwards<00:01:46.810> particularly<00:01:47.590> this<00:01:48.280> is<00:01:48.460> it

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:48.840 
coming upwards particularly this is it

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.180 
coming upwards particularly this is it
you<00:01:49.840> have<00:01:49.960> to<00:01:50.140> wait<00:01:50.320> for<00:01:50.530> your<00:01:50.590> chance<00:01:50.860> to<00:01:50.979> get

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:51.190 
you have to wait for your chance to get

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:53.340 
you have to wait for your chance to get
through<00:01:51.430> be<00:01:51.610> very<00:01:52.119> careful<00:01:52.690> because<00:01:52.869> if<00:01:53.229> you

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:53.350 
through be very careful because if you

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.130 
through be very careful because if you
lose<00:01:53.740> that<00:01:53.920> dinosaur<00:01:54.600> odds<00:01:55.600> are<00:01:55.869> higgins

00:01:56.130 --> 00:01:56.140 
lose that dinosaur odds are higgins

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:59.330 
lose that dinosaur odds are higgins
going<00:01:56.320> to<00:01:56.380> be<00:01:56.590> too<00:01:56.830> slow<00:01:57.130> to<00:01:57.190> make<00:01:57.399> it<00:01:57.580> in<00:01:57.700> time

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
going to be too slow to make it in time

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.770 
going to be too slow to make it in time
but<00:02:00.340> we<00:02:00.520> did<00:02:00.670> it<00:02:00.700> so<00:02:00.850> thankfully<00:02:01.509> I<00:02:01.540> don't<00:02:01.690> have

which<00:03:13.050> I<00:03:13.290> think<00:03:13.470> I<00:03:13.560> said<00:03:13.770> that<00:03:13.920> before<00:03:14.070> but

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
which I think I said that before but

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.120 
which I think I said that before but
it's<00:03:14.730> probably<00:03:15.120> been<00:03:15.210> a<00:03:15.240> while<00:03:15.770> just<00:03:16.770> repeat

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:17.130 
it's probably been a while just repeat

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:29.180 
it's probably been a while just repeat
myself<00:03:19.640> 200<00:03:20.640> points<00:03:20.910> to<00:03:21.030> add<00:03:21.180> to<00:03:21.360> my<00:03:21.480> score<00:03:28.190> now

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
myself 200 points to add to my score now

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.370 
myself 200 points to add to my score now
there's<00:03:29.430> two<00:03:29.670> versions<00:03:29.880> of<00:03:30.270> the<00:03:30.360> clouds<00:03:30.630> there

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:31.380 
there's two versions of the clouds there

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:34.190 
there's two versions of the clouds there
is<00:03:31.560> the<00:03:32.160> side-scrolling<00:03:32.520> style<00:03:33.330> platforming

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
is the side-scrolling style platforming

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:36.620 
is the side-scrolling style platforming
ones<00:03:34.550> there's<00:03:35.550> a<00:03:35.640> vertical<00:03:35.910> client<00:03:36.540> that's

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:36.630 
ones there's a vertical client that's

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:40.449 
ones there's a vertical client that's
similar<00:03:36.870> to<00:03:36.990> the<00:03:37.260> vertical<00:03:37.500> cave<00:03:38.040> areas<00:03:38.370> and

00:03:40.449 --> 00:03:40.459 
similar to the vertical cave areas and

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:42.970 
similar to the vertical cave areas and
neither<00:03:41.090> of<00:03:41.180> them<00:03:41.299> of<00:03:41.420> that<00:03:41.540> heart<00:03:41.780> really<00:03:41.989> but

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:42.980 
neither of them of that heart really but

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:44.649 
neither of them of that heart really but
I<00:03:43.010> think<00:03:43.189> it's<00:03:43.549> safer<00:03:43.909> to<00:03:43.939> fly<00:03:44.329> through<00:03:44.569> that

00:03:44.649 --> 00:03:44.659 
I think it's safer to fly through that

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:46.720 
I think it's safer to fly through that
with<00:03:45.019> the<00:03:45.140> vertical<00:03:45.920> climb<00:03:46.129> than<00:03:46.549> the

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:46.730 
with the vertical climb than the

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:48.699 
with the vertical climb than the
side-scrolling<00:03:47.000> button<00:03:47.780> the<00:03:48.349> main<00:03:48.500> interest

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:48.709 
side-scrolling button the main interest

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:51.099 
side-scrolling button the main interest
of<00:03:48.829> saving<00:03:48.980> time<00:03:49.159> and<00:03:49.400> you<00:03:50.390> know<00:03:50.510> everything

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:51.109 
of saving time and you know everything

00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:52.750 
of saving time and you know everything
else<00:03:51.200> since<00:03:51.709> I<00:03:51.769> know<00:03:51.829> I<00:03:51.920> can<00:03:52.189> do<00:03:52.340> this<00:03:52.370> with

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:52.760 
else since I know I can do this with

Tara T deck yeah with the pterodactyl I

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:56.890 
Tara T deck yeah with the pterodactyl I
might<00:03:55.849> as<00:03:55.909> well<00:03:55.969> do<00:03:56.150> it<00:03:56.180> this<00:03:56.390> way<00:03:56.569> you<00:03:56.750> just

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:56.900 
might as well do it this way you just

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:00.190 
might as well do it this way you just
have<00:03:56.989> to<00:03:57.109> be<00:03:57.200> careful<00:03:57.620> of<00:03:57.739> the<00:03:59.200> exceedingly
