00:03:02.729 --> 00:03:02.739 
remember coke being very open last year

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:04.710 
remember coke being very open last year
and<00:03:02.890> the<00:03:03.280> year<00:03:03.310> before<00:03:03.489> in<00:03:03.880> fact<00:03:03.910> so<00:03:04.390> I<00:03:04.420> want<00:03:04.660> to

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:04.720 
and the year before in fact so I want to

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.479 
and the year before in fact so I want to
try<00:03:04.870> max<00:03:05.050> got<00:03:05.260> the<00:03:05.350> 78<00:03:05.769> pace<00:03:05.980> he's<00:03:06.190> got<00:03:06.340> some

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:06.489 
try max got the 78 pace he's got some

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:08.370 
try max got the 78 pace he's got some
nice<00:03:06.640> shooting<00:03:07.030> ability<00:03:07.450> and<00:03:07.720> I<00:03:07.989> think<00:03:08.260> he

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:08.380 
nice shooting ability and I think he

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:09.990 
nice shooting ability and I think he
will<00:03:08.590> actually<00:03:08.950> pay<00:03:09.130> a<00:03:09.160> cent<00:03:09.459> amid<00:03:09.730> rolled

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
will actually pay a cent amid rolled

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000 
will actually pay a cent amid rolled
very<00:03:10.330> very<00:03:10.600> well<00:03:10.780> I<00:03:10.930> think<00:03:11.170> he's<00:03:11.470> wasted<00:03:11.890> at

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:12.010 
very very well I think he's wasted at

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:13.740 
very very well I think he's wasted at
the<00:03:12.100> cem<00:03:12.459> position<00:03:12.910> but<00:03:13.420> I<00:03:13.450> think<00:03:13.630> he's

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:13.750 
the cem position but I think he's

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:15.300 
the cem position but I think he's
perfect<00:03:13.780> for<00:03:14.170> that<00:03:14.290> sentiment<00:03:14.769> so<00:03:14.920> we<00:03:15.010> do<00:03:15.160> go

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:15.310 
perfect for that sentiment so we do go

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:16.770 
perfect for that sentiment so we do go
out<00:03:15.430> and<00:03:15.580> buy<00:03:15.670> him<00:03:15.880> from<00:03:15.970> sheffield<00:03:16.420> wednesday

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:16.780 
out and buy him from sheffield wednesday

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.229 
out and buy him from sheffield wednesday
for<00:03:17.230> 4.4<00:03:17.890> k<00:03:18.100> which<00:03:18.340> i<00:03:18.519> think<00:03:18.670> it's<00:03:18.910> actually<00:03:19.060> a

00:03:19.229 --> 00:03:19.239 
for 4.4 k which i think it's actually a

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:21.150 
for 4.4 k which i think it's actually a
pretty<00:03:19.420> good<00:03:19.510> price<00:03:19.780> we<00:03:20.470> had<00:03:20.620> two<00:03:20.860> players

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:21.160 
pretty good price we had two players

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:24.270 
pretty good price we had two players
well<00:03:21.910> I<00:03:22.090> I<00:03:22.209> was<00:03:22.600> thinking<00:03:22.930> a<00:03:23.200> short<00:03:24.010> list<00:03:24.160> to

00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:24.280 
well I I was thinking a short list to

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.190 
well I I was thinking a short list to
other<00:03:24.519> players<00:03:24.790> whether<00:03:25.090> or<00:03:25.299> not<00:03:25.360> it<00:03:25.510> bab<00:03:25.870> I

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:26.200 
other players whether or not it bab I

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:27.990 
other players whether or not it bab I
think<00:03:26.530> you<00:03:26.620> pronounce<00:03:26.950> it<00:03:27.100> from<00:03:27.549> Liverpool

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
think you pronounce it from Liverpool

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.789 
think you pronounce it from Liverpool
but<00:03:28.450> I<00:03:28.480> went<00:03:28.660> with<00:03:28.780> Bigirimana<00:03:29.320> because<00:03:29.650> he's

00:03:29.789 --> 00:03:29.799 
but I went with Bigirimana because he's

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:32.310 
but I went with Bigirimana because he's
had<00:03:29.920> a<00:03:30.310> nationality<00:03:30.700> change<00:03:31.000> to<00:03:31.600> the<00:03:31.780> English

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:32.320 
had a nationality change to the English

00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:34.470 
had a nationality change to the English
nation<00:03:32.500> so<00:03:33.070> that's<00:03:33.579> two<00:03:33.790> that's<00:03:34.030> not<00:03:34.209> what<00:03:34.360> I'm

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:34.480 
nation so that's two that's not what I'm

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.150 
nation so that's two that's not what I'm
not<00:03:34.600> complaining<00:03:35.079> he<00:03:35.200> can<00:03:35.350> fit<00:03:35.500> into<00:03:35.620> my<00:03:35.829> Steam

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:36.160 
not complaining he can fit into my Steam

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.160 
not complaining he can fit into my Steam
and<00:03:36.370> we're<00:03:36.940> going<00:03:37.060> to<00:03:37.120> move<00:03:37.239> into<00:03:37.420> the<00:03:37.750> second

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:38.170 
and we're going to move into the second

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:40.860 
and we're going to move into the second
game<00:03:38.290> of<00:03:38.320> the<00:03:38.680> episode<00:03:39.220> and<00:03:39.510> this<00:03:40.510> probably

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:40.870 
game of the episode and this probably

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:42.210 
game of the episode and this probably
it's<00:03:41.290> going<00:03:41.470> to<00:03:41.530> be<00:03:41.680> one<00:03:41.860> of<00:03:41.890> the<00:03:41.980> hardest

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:42.220 
it's going to be one of the hardest

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:43.740 
it's going to be one of the hardest
games<00:03:42.579> i've<00:03:42.850> ever<00:03:42.880> played<00:03:43.090> it's<00:03:43.480> got<00:03:43.600> nice

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.380 
games i've ever played it's got nice
chemistry<00:03:44.019> 64<00:03:44.920> attack<00:03:45.730> which<00:03:46.030> should<00:03:46.269> have

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:46.390 
chemistry 64 attack which should have

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:49.440 
chemistry 64 attack which should have
probably<00:03:46.540> wrong<00:03:47.470> some<00:03:47.769> bells<00:03:48.010> but<00:03:48.370> that<00:03:48.760> is<00:03:49.120> a

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:49.450 
probably wrong some bells but that is a

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:51.599 
probably wrong some bells but that is a

highlights in just so you get a gist of

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:05.759 
highlights in just so you get a gist of
what<00:04:03.519> went<00:04:03.700> on<00:04:03.880> in<00:04:04.120> the<00:04:04.329> game<00:04:04.510> itself<00:04:05.049> and<00:04:05.380> in

00:04:05.759 --> 00:04:05.769 
what went on in the game itself and in

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:07.590 
what went on in the game itself and in
the<00:04:05.859> 12th<00:04:06.160> minute<00:04:06.190> I<00:04:06.670> actually<00:04:06.970> changed<00:04:07.450> my

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:07.600 
the 12th minute I actually changed my

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:08.880 
the 12th minute I actually changed my
style<00:04:07.840> because<00:04:08.200> I<00:04:08.290> didn't<00:04:08.560> really<00:04:08.650> want<00:04:08.859> to

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:08.890 
style because I didn't really want to

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:11.310 
style because I didn't really want to
give<00:04:09.070> it<00:04:09.190> away<00:04:09.280> tin<00:04:09.730> well<00:04:10.209> too<00:04:10.480> often<00:04:10.930> because

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:11.320 
give it away tin well too often because

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:12.690 
give it away tin well too often because
if<00:04:11.530> I<00:04:11.650> did<00:04:11.859> I<00:04:11.890> knew<00:04:12.190> I<00:04:12.220> was<00:04:12.370> going<00:04:12.489> to<00:04:12.579> get

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:12.700 
if I did I knew I was going to get

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:14.250 
if I did I knew I was going to get
punished<00:04:13.060> with<00:04:13.180> that<00:04:13.299> pace<00:04:13.510> especially<00:04:13.750> on

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:14.260 
punished with that pace especially on

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.140 
punished with that pace especially on
the<00:04:14.350> counter-attack<00:04:14.739> it's<00:04:15.430> got<00:04:15.549> a<00:04:15.579> duo<00:04:15.850> who's

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.150 
the counter-attack it's got a duo who's

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:18.390 
the counter-attack it's got a duo who's
like<00:04:16.329> 95<00:04:16.930> pace<00:04:17.229> which<00:04:17.470> is<00:04:17.650> just<00:04:17.769> ridiculous

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:18.400
