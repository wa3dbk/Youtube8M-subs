do need to watch out mainly for the

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.320 
do need to watch out mainly for the
greninja<00:01:10.619> and<00:01:10.890> the<00:01:10.950> talonflame<00:01:11.369> so<00:01:12.119> I<00:01:12.150> just

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
greninja and the talonflame so I just

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:13.550 
greninja and the talonflame so I just
make<00:01:12.540> sure<00:01:12.570> I<00:01:12.720> have<00:01:12.900> stuff<00:01:13.110> that<00:01:13.140> it<00:01:13.350> speeds

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
make sure I have stuff that it speeds

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.350 
make sure I have stuff that it speeds
them<00:01:13.770> or<00:01:13.950> can<00:01:14.189> take<00:01:14.250> some<00:01:14.729> semblance<00:01:14.939> of<00:01:15.150> hits

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
them or can take some semblance of hits

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.880 
them or can take some semblance of hits
but<00:01:15.509> I<00:01:15.570> figured<00:01:15.840> you'd<00:01:15.960> go<00:01:16.140> with<00:01:16.170> fringe<00:01:16.530> ax<00:01:16.710> or

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
but I figured you'd go with fringe ax or

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.469 
but I figured you'd go with fringe ax or
the<00:01:17.040> talonflame<00:01:17.369> sides<00:01:17.759> i<00:01:17.909> believe<00:01:18.119> is<00:01:18.210> Rotem

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
the talonflame sides i believe is Rotem

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:20.810 
the talonflame sides i believe is Rotem
he<00:01:19.229> decides<00:01:19.530> ally<00:01:19.710> with<00:01:19.830> a<00:01:19.920> hitman<00:01:20.189> language<00:01:20.640> I

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:20.820 
he decides ally with a hitman language I

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.640 
he decides ally with a hitman language I
mean<00:01:21.119> it<00:01:21.240> works<00:01:21.509> cuz<00:01:21.810> it'll<00:01:22.049> kind<00:01:22.439> of<00:01:22.530> hit

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
mean it works cuz it'll kind of hit

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.130 
mean it works cuz it'll kind of hit
Rotom<00:01:22.920> decently<00:01:23.250> but<00:01:23.520> he<00:01:24.360> just<00:01:24.420> goes<00:01:24.750> first

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
Rotom decently but he just goes first

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.039 
Rotom decently but he just goes first
turn<00:01:25.380> fake-out<00:01:26.040> normal<00:01:26.970> gym<00:01:27.150> unburden

00:01:28.039 --> 00:01:28.049 
turn fake-out normal gym unburden

00:01:28.049 --> 00:01:30.380 
turn fake-out normal gym unburden
so<00:01:28.409> that's<00:01:29.130> fine<00:01:29.340> i<00:01:29.369> figure<00:01:29.670> i<00:01:29.700> can<00:01:29.790> take<00:01:30.060> one

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
so that's fine i figure i can take one

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.210 
so that's fine i figure i can take one
close<00:01:30.659> combat<00:01:30.990> and<00:01:31.380> then<00:01:31.530> i<00:01:31.560> can<00:01:31.740> voltage<00:01:32.070> out

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:32.220 
close combat and then i can voltage out

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:33.530 
close combat and then i can voltage out
and<00:01:32.340> see<00:01:32.430> what's<00:01:32.579> going<00:01:32.729> on<00:01:32.820> but<00:01:33.060> he<00:01:33.420> actually

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
and see what's going on but he actually

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.270 
and see what's going on but he actually
goes<00:01:33.780> your<00:01:33.960> poison<00:01:34.409> job<00:01:34.560> which<00:01:34.710> i<00:01:34.799> found<00:01:35.009> weird

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280 
goes your poison job which i found weird

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.039 
goes your poison job which i found weird
cuz<00:01:35.490> he<00:01:35.610> had<00:01:35.729> I<00:01:36.000> guess<00:01:36.329> even<00:01:36.540> want<00:01:36.840> against

00:01:37.039 --> 00:01:37.049 
cuz he had I guess even want against

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:38.630 
cuz he had I guess even want against
defense<00:01:37.439> Lord<00:01:37.770> yet<00:01:37.920> and<00:01:38.130> he<00:01:38.280> figured<00:01:38.549> you

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:38.640 
defense Lord yet and he figured you

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:39.430 
defense Lord yet and he figured you
could<00:01:38.759> take<00:01:38.880> a<00:01:38.970> hit<00:01:39.090> from

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:39.440 
could take a hit from

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:40.870 
could take a hit from
I<00:01:39.470> might<00:01:39.890> as<00:01:39.950> well<00:01:40.070> just<00:01:40.190> do<00:01:40.310> that<00:01:40.430> but<00:01:40.670> I<00:01:40.700> don't

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:40.880 
I might as well just do that but I don't

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:42.160 
I might as well just do that but I don't
know<00:01:40.940> he<00:01:41.030> also<00:01:41.180> poisons<00:01:41.750> me<00:01:41.810> in<00:01:41.960> the<00:01:42.020> process

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:42.170 
know he also poisons me in the process

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.160 
know he also poisons me in the process
which<00:01:42.560> is<00:01:43.010> dumb<00:01:43.250> but<00:01:44.120> I'll<00:01:44.390> move<00:01:45.050> on

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
which is dumb but I'll move on

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.290 
which is dumb but I'll move on
from<00:01:45.350> it<00:01:45.470> and<00:01:45.590> live<00:01:45.830> but<00:01:46.490> anyways<00:01:47.120> every

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:47.300 
from it and live but anyways every

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:48.520 
from it and live but anyways every
convenience<00:01:47.510> orders<00:01:47.900> I<00:01:47.960> figure<00:01:48.170> I<00:01:48.200> can<00:01:48.350> take

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
convenience orders I figure I can take

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:50.440 
convenience orders I figure I can take
any<00:01:48.710> hit<00:01:49.040> and<00:01:49.190> really<00:01:49.520> wants<00:01:49.730> to<00:01:49.790> go<00:01:49.970> for<00:01:50.180> and

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:50.450 
any hit and really wants to go for and

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:52.960 
any hit and really wants to go for and
then<00:01:50.630> I<00:01:51.400> didn't<00:01:52.400> think<00:01:52.520> you'd<00:01:52.760> go<00:01:52.880> to

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:52.970 
then I didn't think you'd go to

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:54.580 
then I didn't think you'd go to
aegislash<00:01:53.360> right<00:01:53.780> off<00:01:53.900> the<00:01:54.080> bat<00:01:54.230> so<00:01:54.470> I<00:01:54.500> was

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:54.590 
aegislash right off the bat so I was

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.110 
aegislash right off the bat so I was
like<00:01:54.650> okay<00:01:54.860> I'll<00:01:55.310> just<00:01:55.490> go<00:01:55.610> for<00:01:55.760> sludge<00:01:55.940> bomb

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:56.120 
like okay I'll just go for sludge bomb

00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:59.110 
like okay I'll just go for sludge bomb
and<00:01:56.360> i'll<00:01:56.510> hit<00:01:56.660> whatever<00:01:56.960> but<00:01:57.440> yeah<00:01:58.370> hey<00:01:58.850> josh

00:01:59.110 --> 00:01:59.120 
and i'll hit whatever but yeah hey josh

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:00.160 
and i'll hit whatever but yeah hey josh
came<00:01:59.330> in<00:01:59.450> so<00:01:59.540> i<00:01:59.600> kind<00:01:59.750> of<00:01:59.780> take<00:01:59.900> this<00:01:59.990> ledge

00:02:00.160 --> 00:02:00.170 
came in so i kind of take this ledge

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:02.020 
came in so i kind of take this ledge
moment<00:02:00.440> but<00:02:00.590> i<00:02:00.770> figure<00:02:01.130> here<00:02:01.340> i<00:02:01.370> can<00:02:01.700> go<00:02:01.850> for

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:02.030 
moment but i figure here i can go for

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:03.340 
moment but i figure here i can go for
the<00:02:02.090> leech<00:02:02.270> seed<00:02:02.480> so<00:02:02.750> should<00:02:02.960> be<00:02:03.020> able<00:02:03.080> to<00:02:03.230> take

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:03.350 
the leech seed so should be able to take

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:06.700 
the leech seed so should be able to take
most<00:02:03.800> hits<00:02:04.190> from<00:02:04.490> a<00:02:04.670> tower<00:02:05.030> up<00:02:05.480> from<00:02:06.380> an<00:02:06.500> age<00:02:06.680> of

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:06.710 
most hits from a tower up from an age of

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.620 
most hits from a tower up from an age of
/<00:02:07.040> so<00:02:07.280> i<00:02:07.340> figure<00:02:07.580> i'll<00:02:07.700> get<00:02:07.850> leech<00:02:08.030> seed<00:02:08.240> set<00:02:08.479> up

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:08.630 
/ so i figure i'll get leech seed set up

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.560 
/ so i figure i'll get leech seed set up
and<00:02:08.890> get<00:02:09.890> him<00:02:10.040> started<00:02:10.340> on<00:02:10.550> the<00:02:10.700> path<00:02:10.850> of<00:02:11.120> you

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:11.570 
and get him started on the path of you

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:13.150 
and get him started on the path of you
know<00:02:12.200> dying<00:02:12.410> eventually<00:02:12.890> i'm<00:02:13.040> just

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:13.160 
know dying eventually i'm just

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.620 
know dying eventually i'm just
going<00:02:13.280> to<00:02:13.340> start<00:02:13.460> your<00:02:13.850> training<00:02:14.000> because<00:02:14.360> i

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:14.630 
going to start your training because i

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:17.080 
going to start your training because i
really<00:02:15.380> want<00:02:15.560> to<00:02:15.590> find<00:02:15.800> out<00:02:15.890> what<00:02:16.190> moves<00:02:16.820> he

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
really want to find out what moves he

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.960 
really want to find out what moves he
has<00:02:17.330> and<00:02:17.720> see<00:02:18.680> what<00:02:18.890> thread<00:02:19.190> it<00:02:19.310> really<00:02:19.670> poses

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
has and see what thread it really poses

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:22.780 
has and see what thread it really poses
to<00:02:20.270> my<00:02:20.390> venusaur<00:02:20.960> and<00:02:21.230> it<00:02:22.190> looks<00:02:22.430> like<00:02:22.610> she

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:22.790 
to my venusaur and it looks like she

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:24.790 
to my venusaur and it looks like she
just<00:02:22.820> wants<00:02:23.150> to<00:02:23.210> get<00:02:23.300> a<00:02:23.360> 2<00:02:23.810> plus<00:02:23.960> 6<00:02:24.320> and<00:02:24.500> sweep

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:24.800 
just wants to get a 2 plus 6 and sweep

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.060 
just wants to get a 2 plus 6 and sweep
which<00:02:25.070> I<00:02:25.400> do<00:02:25.820> have<00:02:26.300> something<00:02:27.140> I<00:02:27.590> think<00:02:27.620> to

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:28.070 
which I do have something I think to

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:31.240 
which I do have something I think to
take<00:02:28.310> a<00:02:28.340> shadow<00:02:28.760> sneak<00:02:29.060> so<00:02:29.570> I'm<00:02:30.380> really<00:02:31.010> not

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
take a shadow sneak so I'm really not

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:32.890 
take a shadow sneak so I'm really not
that<00:02:31.460> concerned<00:02:31.880> about<00:02:32.090> the<00:02:32.420> whole<00:02:32.570> shadow

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:32.900 
that concerned about the whole shadow

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.250 
that concerned about the whole shadow
sneaking<00:02:33.470> it<00:02:33.590> plus<00:02:33.830> 6<00:02:34.220> so<00:02:34.700> I'm<00:02:35.630> really<00:02:36.080> just

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:36.260 
sneaking it plus 6 so I'm really just

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.200 
sneaking it plus 6 so I'm really just
trying<00:02:36.590> to<00:02:37.160> whittle<00:02:37.370> it<00:02:37.550> down<00:02:37.610> a<00:02:37.760> little<00:02:38.030> bit

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:38.210 
trying to whittle it down a little bit

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:39.640 
trying to whittle it down a little bit
so<00:02:38.450> that<00:02:38.480> it's<00:02:38.810> gonna<00:02:38.930> be<00:02:39.110> easier<00:02:39.440> to<00:02:39.470> take

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:39.650 
so that it's gonna be easier to take

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.800 
so that it's gonna be easier to take
down<00:02:39.800> right<00:02:40.040> need<00:02:40.280> to<00:02:40.340> take<00:02:40.520> it<00:02:40.640> down<00:02:40.730> but<00:02:40.970> not

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:41.810 
down right need to take it down but not

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:43.630 
down right need to take it down but not
only<00:02:41.900> is<00:02:41.990> that<00:02:42.050> plus<00:02:42.350> 6<00:02:42.590> of<00:02:42.770> honestly<00:02:43.190> kind<00:02:43.489> of

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:43.640 
only is that plus 6 of honestly kind of

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:45.220 
only is that plus 6 of honestly kind of
scared<00:02:43.910> of<00:02:44.030> the<00:02:44.120> prospect<00:02:44.540> of<00:02:44.660> an<00:02:44.780> iron<00:02:44.959> head

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
scared of the prospect of an iron head

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:48.040 
scared of the prospect of an iron head
so<00:02:45.410> I<00:02:45.470> decided<00:02:45.800> to<00:02:45.860> go<00:02:46.010> to<00:02:46.070> Rotom<00:02:46.550> and<00:02:46.930> see<00:02:47.930> what

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:48.050 
so I decided to go to Rotom and see what

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:50.740 
so I decided to go to Rotom and see what
he's<00:02:48.170> got<00:02:48.320> going<00:02:48.380> on<00:02:48.739> and<00:02:49.070> hope<00:02:49.310> that<00:02:49.670> it<00:02:49.970> is

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:50.750 
he's got going on and hope that it is

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:52.000 
he's got going on and hope that it is
not<00:02:50.989> something<00:02:51.200> that<00:02:51.380> would<00:02:51.590> completely

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:52.010 
not something that would completely

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:54.699 
not something that would completely
destroy<00:02:52.310> everything<00:02:53.030> I<00:02:53.239> have<00:02:53.660> but<00:02:54.320> he<00:02:54.410> goes

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:54.709 
destroy everything I have but he goes

00:02:54.709 --> 00:02:56.199 
destroy everything I have but he goes
for<00:02:54.890> sacred<00:02:55.100> sword<00:02:55.400> so<00:02:55.550> if<00:02:55.640> I<00:02:55.700> stay<00:02:55.910> tuned<00:02:56.090> with

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:56.209 
for sacred sword so if I stay tuned with

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:57.610 
for sacred sword so if I stay tuned with
Venus<00:02:56.420> or<00:02:56.540> I<00:02:56.570> would<00:02:56.690> have<00:02:56.720> been<00:02:56.870> just<00:02:56.900> fine<00:02:57.200> but

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
Venus or I would have been just fine but

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.949 
Venus or I would have been just fine but
you<00:02:58.430> know<00:02:58.520> the<00:02:58.670> prospect<00:02:59.090> of<00:02:59.239> that<00:02:59.300> iron<00:02:59.690> head

00:02:59.949 --> 00:02:59.959 
you know the prospect of that iron head

00:02:59.959 --> 00:03:02.560 
you know the prospect of that iron head
was<00:03:00.350> too<00:03:00.650> great<00:03:00.920> that<00:03:00.980> I<00:03:01.220> just<00:03:01.430> really<00:03:02.360> didn't

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:02.570 
was too great that I just really didn't

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:04.960 
was too great that I just really didn't

burst<00:03:52.939> is<00:03:53.180> kind<00:03:53.510> of<00:03:53.629> a<00:03:53.780> UH<00:03:54.819> all-around<00:03:55.819> safe

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:56.180 
burst is kind of a UH all-around safe

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:57.759 
burst is kind of a UH all-around safe
move<00:03:56.450> which<00:03:56.690> he<00:03:56.810> goes<00:03:56.989> into<00:03:57.200> the<00:03:57.319> fissure

00:03:57.759 --> 00:03:57.769 
move which he goes into the fissure

00:03:57.769 --> 00:04:00.130 
move which he goes into the fissure
which<00:03:57.980> means<00:03:58.430> not<00:03:59.269> the<00:03:59.420> safest<00:03:59.659> move<00:03:59.930> the

which means not the safest move the
world<00:04:00.290> that's<00:04:00.440> not<00:04:00.560> the<00:04:00.620> worst<00:04:00.890> min<00:04:01.159> of<00:04:01.280> the

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:03.170 
world but here I figured you would just

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:04.660 
world but here I figured you would just
go<00:04:03.260> for<00:04:03.409> sucker<00:04:03.620> punch<00:04:03.920> because<00:04:04.129> I<00:04:04.430> mean

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:04.670 
go for sucker punch because I mean

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:07.199 
go for sucker punch because I mean
honestly<00:04:05.239> I'm<00:04:05.540> not<00:04:05.599> expecting<00:04:06.019> too<00:04:06.409> much

00:04:07.199 --> 00:04:07.209 
honestly I'm not expecting too much

00:04:07.209 --> 00:04:09.399 
honestly I'm not expecting too much
prediction<00:04:08.209> out<00:04:08.359> of<00:04:08.510> him<00:04:08.629> that<00:04:08.840> much<00:04:09.109> but<00:04:09.140> I

00:04:09.399 --> 00:04:09.409 
prediction out of him that much but I

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:11.110 
prediction out of him that much but I
figure<00:04:09.680> it<00:04:09.920> is<00:04:10.280> a<00:04:10.310> safe<00:04:10.609> play<00:04:10.760> to<00:04:10.819> go<00:04:10.970> to

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120 
figure it is a safe play to go to

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:12.729 
figure it is a safe play to go to
internet<00:04:11.510> because<00:04:11.720> even<00:04:12.140> iron<00:04:12.409> header<00:04:12.650> should

00:04:12.729 --> 00:04:12.739 
internet because even iron header should

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:14.050 
internet because even iron header should
be<00:04:12.980> able<00:04:13.040> to<00:04:13.159> take<00:04:13.280> well<00:04:13.489> enough<00:04:13.730> and<00:04:13.879> then

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:14.060 
be able to take well enough and then

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:15.460 
be able to take well enough and then
Mauch<00:04:14.299> punch<00:04:14.569> obviously<00:04:15.019> won't<00:04:15.140> pirate

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:15.470 
Mauch punch obviously won't pirate

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:18.729 
Mauch punch obviously won't pirate
variety<00:04:15.890> to<00:04:16.459> take<00:04:16.669> out<00:04:16.850> BB<00:04:17.239> sharp<00:04:17.539> and<00:04:17.720> I<00:04:17.750> guess

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:18.739 
variety to take out BB sharp and I guess

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:20.259 
variety to take out BB sharp and I guess
he<00:04:18.829> didn't<00:04:19.039> expect<00:04:19.340> it<00:04:19.430> so<00:04:19.489> fish<00:04:19.910> shark<00:04:20.090> just

00:04:20.259 --> 00:04:20.269 
he didn't expect it so fish shark just

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:22.060 
he didn't expect it so fish shark just
goes<00:04:20.419> down<00:04:20.630> but<00:04:21.169> now<00:04:21.260> he<00:04:21.320> goes<00:04:21.500> in<00:04:21.709> the<00:04:21.829> hell

just<00:04:31.699> act<00:04:31.880> no<00:04:32.000> ever<00:04:32.120> to<00:04:32.360> figure<00:04:32.600> I<00:04:32.630> won't<00:04:32.840> need

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:32.960 
just act no ever to figure I won't need

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:34.930 
just act no ever to figure I won't need
it<00:04:33.020> and<00:04:33.350> basically<00:04:34.039> I<00:04:34.280> dracaena<00:04:34.550> wear<00:04:34.760> down

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:34.940 
it and basically I dracaena wear down

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:37.570 
it and basically I dracaena wear down
the<00:04:34.970> talonflame<00:04:35.300> at<00:04:35.510> this<00:04:35.600> point<00:04:35.870> um<00:04:36.580> I'm

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:37.580 
the talonflame at this point um I'm

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:39.100 
the talonflame at this point um I'm
gonna<00:04:37.789> attempt<00:04:38.210> to<00:04:38.240> go<00:04:38.479> for<00:04:38.690> the<00:04:38.720> sucker<00:04:38.990> punch

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:39.110 
gonna attempt to go for the sucker punch

00:04:39.110 --> 00:04:41.110 
gonna attempt to go for the sucker punch
right<00:04:39.440> here<00:04:39.500> mainly<00:04:40.340> just<00:04:40.639> in<00:04:40.820> case<00:04:41.000> he

00:04:41.110 --> 00:04:41.120 
right here mainly just in case he

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:42.610 
right here mainly just in case he
decided<00:04:41.449> to<00:04:41.539> go<00:04:41.660> for<00:04:41.780> Flair<00:04:42.020> book<00:04:42.199> but<00:04:42.440> now

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:42.620 
decided to go for Flair book but now

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:44.500 
decided to go for Flair book but now
that<00:04:42.770> I<00:04:42.860> have<00:04:43.010> it<00:04:43.090> established<00:04:44.090> that<00:04:44.270> he's

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:44.510 
that I have it established that he's

00:04:44.510 --> 00:04:46.870 
that I have it established that he's
going<00:04:44.750> for<00:04:44.990> brave<00:04:45.229> bird<00:04:45.530> I<00:04:45.770> figured<00:04:46.610> at<00:04:46.729> this

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:46.880 
going for brave bird I figured at this

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:48.879 
going for brave bird I figured at this
point<00:04:47.120> he<00:04:47.360> wouldn't<00:04:47.720> just<00:04:47.780> switch<00:04:48.349> it<00:04:48.380> up<00:04:48.590> so<00:04:48.830> I

00:04:48.879 --> 00:04:48.889 
point he wouldn't just switch it up so I

00:04:48.889 --> 00:04:51.010 
point he wouldn't just switch it up so I
just<00:04:49.220> decided<00:04:49.370> to<00:04:49.669> go<00:04:49.729> for<00:04:49.849> knock<00:04:50.030> off<00:04:50.210> to<00:04:50.780> try

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:51.020 
just decided to go for knock off to try

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:52.180 
just decided to go for knock off to try
and<00:04:51.110> take<00:04:51.229> him<00:04:51.349> down<00:04:51.440> figuring<00:04:51.830> I<00:04:51.889> can<00:04:52.070> take

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:52.190 
and take him down figuring I can take

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:53.710 
and take him down figuring I can take
another<00:04:52.370> brain<00:04:52.610> /<00:04:52.789> bay<00:04:52.940> turns<00:04:53.210> out<00:04:53.449> he<00:04:53.599> was

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:53.720 
another brain / bay turns out he was

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:55.900 
another brain / bay turns out he was
actually<00:04:53.840> choice<00:04:54.289> banded<00:04:54.530> so<00:04:54.949> that<00:04:55.699> is<00:04:55.880> a

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:55.910 
actually choice banded so that is a

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:58.270 
actually choice banded so that is a
little<00:04:56.120> bit<00:04:56.270> more<00:04:56.599> to<00:04:56.780> do<00:04:56.900> with<00:04:57.020> it<00:04:57.229> but<00:04:58.010> you

00:04:58.270 --> 00:04:58.280 
little bit more to do with it but you

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:59.830 
little bit more to do with it but you
know<00:04:58.520> that's<00:04:58.760> fine<00:04:58.940> by<00:04:59.120> me<00:04:59.150> because<00:04:59.449> I<00:04:59.660> still

00:04:59.830 --> 00:04:59.840 
know that's fine by me because I still

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:01.300 
know that's fine by me because I still
take<00:04:59.960> him<00:05:00.080> out<00:05:00.169> I<00:05:00.199> do<00:05:00.349> lose<00:05:00.620> Fisher<00:05:00.979> up<00:05:01.070> in<00:05:01.190> the

00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:01.310 
take him out I do lose Fisher up in the

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:02.920 
take him out I do lose Fisher up in the
process<00:05:01.760> but<00:05:01.880> I<00:05:01.940> shouldn't<00:05:02.389> need<00:05:02.510> it<00:05:02.570> for<00:05:02.810> much

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:02.930 
process but I shouldn't need it for much

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:05.860 
process but I shouldn't need it for much
else<00:05:03.080> so<00:05:03.830> I<00:05:03.860> feel<00:05:04.250> safe<00:05:04.490> enough<00:05:04.760> anyways<00:05:05.720> he

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:05.870 
else so I feel safe enough anyways he

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:07.330 
else so I feel safe enough anyways he
brings<00:05:06.110> in<00:05:06.320> Grand<00:05:06.650> angel<00:05:06.889> on<00:05:06.949> the<00:05:07.010> double<00:05:07.250> down

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:07.340 
brings in Grand angel on the double down

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:08.620 
brings in Grand angel on the double down
i<00:05:07.400> figured<00:05:07.699> venusaur<00:05:08.090> be<00:05:08.240> able<00:05:08.360> to<00:05:08.419> take<00:05:08.510> on

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:08.630 
i figured venusaur be able to take on

00:05:08.630 --> 00:05:09.969 
i figured venusaur be able to take on
most<00:05:08.810> of<00:05:08.900> his<00:05:08.990> guys<00:05:09.139> so<00:05:09.440> i<00:05:09.470> just<00:05:09.620> go<00:05:09.710> into<00:05:09.860> that

00:05:09.969 --> 00:05:09.979 
most of his guys so i just go into that

00:05:09.979 --> 00:05:12.550 
most of his guys so i just go into that
he<00:05:10.910> gripped<00:05:11.180> me<00:05:11.300> with<00:05:11.449> the<00:05:11.539> ice<00:05:11.690> beam<00:05:12.050> first

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:12.560 
he gripped me with the ice beam first

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.560 
he gripped me with the ice beam first
off<00:05:12.830> but<00:05:13.520> i'm<00:05:13.669> able<00:05:13.849> to<00:05:13.940> cover<00:05:14.090> a<00:05:14.210> good<00:05:14.510> chunk

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:14.570 
off but i'm able to cover a good chunk

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:17.529 
off but i'm able to cover a good chunk
back<00:05:15.139> with<00:05:15.590> the<00:05:15.770> giga<00:05:16.010> drain<00:05:16.220> and<00:05:16.639> i'm<00:05:17.389> just

00:05:38.290 --> 00:05:38.300 
out and then just hit me the close

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:39.580 
out and then just hit me the close
combat<00:05:38.510> to<00:05:38.720> kill<00:05:38.930> me<00:05:39.050> I<00:05:39.080> don't<00:05:39.320> really<00:05:39.440> know

00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:39.590

00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:40.880 
why you went to close convex now it's

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:41.959 
why you went to close convex now it's
give<00:05:41.000> me<00:05:41.090> a<00:05:41.300> lot

00:05:48.259 --> 00:05:48.269 
just the fact that you know it makes it

00:05:48.269 --> 00:05:50.569 
just the fact that you know it makes it
quote<00:05:48.839> unquote<00:05:48.959> easier<00:05:49.469> which<00:05:49.679> really<00:05:50.309> only

much and I'll get up so much boost from

much and I'll get up so much boost from
power<00:06:30.959> punch<00:06:31.319> l'aventure<00:06:31.679> could<00:06:32.009> be<00:06:32.339> able<00:06:32.459> to

00:06:33.949 --> 00:06:33.959 
take down something and you just go to

00:06:33.959 --> 00:06:36.649 
take down something and you just go to
crunch<00:06:34.319> right<00:06:34.529> there<00:06:34.709> which<00:06:34.979> I<00:06:35.419> didn't<00:06:36.419> get

00:06:36.649 --> 00:06:36.659 
crunch right there which I didn't get

00:06:36.659 --> 00:06:38.359 
crunch right there which I didn't get
but<00:06:37.019> it<00:06:37.259> might<00:06:37.439> just<00:06:37.559> be<00:06:37.739> his<00:06:37.799> only<00:06:38.039> attacking

00:06:38.359 --> 00:06:38.369 
but it might just be his only attacking

00:06:38.369 --> 00:06:40.309 
but it might just be his only attacking
if<00:06:38.610> I<00:06:38.729> guess<00:06:38.879> because<00:06:38.969> he<00:06:39.149> didn't<00:06:39.389> want<00:06:39.419> to<00:06:39.779> get

00:06:40.309 --> 00:06:40.319 
if I guess because he didn't want to get

00:06:40.319 --> 00:06:43.939 
if I guess because he didn't want to get
hurt<00:06:41.039> by<00:06:41.399> her<00:06:42.269> avoid<00:06:42.869> hurting<00:06:43.319> ghosts<00:06:43.829> or

hurt by her avoid hurting ghosts or
something<00:06:44.249> I<00:06:44.309> don't<00:06:44.369> know<00:06:44.699> but<00:06:45.449> he's<00:06:45.989> gonna

00:06:46.159 --> 00:06:46.169 
something I don't know but he's gonna

00:06:46.169 --> 00:06:48.259 
something I don't know but he's gonna
rest<00:06:46.469> up<00:06:46.589> right<00:06:46.800> there<00:06:47.009> as<00:06:47.309> I<00:06:47.939> just<00:06:48.179> get

00:06:48.259 --> 00:06:48.269 
rest up right there as I just get

00:06:48.269 --> 00:06:50.089 
rest up right there as I just get
another<00:06:48.389> power<00:06:48.659> punch<00:06:48.869> off<00:06:49.019> which<00:06:49.169> damage<00:06:49.979> is

00:06:50.089 --> 00:06:50.099 
another power punch off which damage is

00:06:50.099 --> 00:06:52.699 
another power punch off which damage is
racking<00:06:50.399> up<00:06:50.519> that's<00:06:50.789> very<00:06:51.209> nice<00:06:51.719> but<00:06:52.079> he<00:06:52.589> has<00:06:52.679> a

00:06:52.699 --> 00:06:52.709 
racking up that's very nice but he has a

00:06:52.709 --> 00:06:54.739 
racking up that's very nice but he has a
Chesto<00:06:53.129> berries<00:06:53.129> so<00:06:53.759> you<00:06:54.119> know<00:06:54.209> resto<00:06:54.509> chest

00:06:54.739 --> 00:06:54.749 
Chesto berries so you know resto chest

00:06:54.749 --> 00:06:56.929 
Chesto berries so you know resto chest
oh<00:06:54.899> so<00:06:55.619> I<00:06:55.649> guess<00:06:55.800> he's<00:06:55.919> just<00:06:55.979> stockpile<00:06:56.519> crunch

00:06:56.929 --> 00:06:56.939 
oh so I guess he's just stockpile crunch

00:06:56.939 --> 00:06:58.850 
oh so I guess he's just stockpile crunch
I'm<00:06:57.959> know<00:06:58.019> what<00:06:58.110> is<00:06:58.199> literate<00:06:58.559> active

00:06:58.850 --> 00:06:58.860 
I'm know what is literate active

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:01.219 
I'm know what is literate active
stock<00:06:59.219> broke<00:06:59.399> on<00:06:59.610> trust<00:06:59.999> what's<00:07:00.929> his<00:07:01.110> last

00:07:01.219 --> 00:07:01.229 
stock broke on trust what's his last

00:07:01.229 --> 00:07:03.109 
stock broke on trust what's his last
move<00:07:01.619> then<00:07:01.860> you<00:07:02.429> think<00:07:02.699> it'd<00:07:02.759> be<00:07:02.789> a<00:07:02.879> normal

00:07:03.109 --> 00:07:03.119 
move then you think it'd be a normal

00:07:03.119 --> 00:07:05.959 
move then you think it'd be a normal
move<00:07:03.449> but<00:07:03.749> I<00:07:03.989> mean<00:07:04.919> I<00:07:05.099> don't<00:07:05.129> know<00:07:05.339> but<00:07:05.639> I<00:07:05.789> just

00:07:05.959 --> 00:07:05.969 
move but I mean I don't know but I just

00:07:05.969 --> 00:07:07.219 
move but I mean I don't know but I just
keep<00:07:06.089> power<00:07:06.300> punching<00:07:06.689> obviously<00:07:07.079> because

00:07:07.219 --> 00:07:07.229 
keep power punching obviously because

00:07:07.229 --> 00:07:08.509 
keep power punching obviously because
that's<00:07:07.379> the<00:07:07.439> best<00:07:07.619> thing<00:07:07.709> to<00:07:07.769> really<00:07:08.039> do<00:07:08.279> and

00:07:08.509 --> 00:07:08.519 
that's the best thing to really do and

00:07:08.519 --> 00:07:11.149 
that's the best thing to really do and
crunch<00:07:09.269> is<00:07:09.569> really<00:07:10.050> not<00:07:10.139> doing<00:07:10.319> much<00:07:10.589> to<00:07:10.860> me<00:07:10.949> so

00:07:11.149 --> 00:07:11.159 
crunch is really not doing much to me so

00:07:11.159 --> 00:07:13.159 
crunch is really not doing much to me so
that's<00:07:11.369> just<00:07:11.879> fine<00:07:11.969> by<00:07:12.149> me<00:07:12.299> and<00:07:12.509> here

00:07:13.159 --> 00:07:13.169 
that's just fine by me and here

00:07:13.169 --> 00:07:15.619 
that's just fine by me and here
I'm<00:07:13.379> able<00:07:13.589> to<00:07:13.919> live<00:07:14.189> the<00:07:14.399> crunch<00:07:14.699> again<00:07:15.209> with

00:07:15.619 --> 00:07:15.629 
I'm able to live the crunch again with

00:07:15.629 --> 00:07:17.989 
I'm able to live the crunch again with
one<00:07:15.809> HP<00:07:15.989> so<00:07:16.319> it's<00:07:16.469> like<00:07:16.589> well<00:07:16.799> he's<00:07:17.429> own<00:07:17.699> health

00:07:17.989 --> 00:07:17.999

I<00:07:18.179> have<00:07:18.569> a<00:07:18.599> good<00:07:18.719> amount<00:07:18.899> of<00:07:18.989> boost<00:07:19.169> bridger

00:07:20.089 --> 00:07:20.099 
I have a good amount of boost bridger

00:07:20.099 --> 00:07:22.009 
I have a good amount of boost bridger
you<00:07:20.279> journal<00:07:20.669> take<00:07:20.849> him<00:07:20.969> down<00:07:21.149> at<00:07:21.539> this<00:07:21.749> range
