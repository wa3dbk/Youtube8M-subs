00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:01.739
 Rieger became 

00:00:01.739 --> 00:00:05.210
 good game he was made with the good feeling of gamer investigators with the 

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:06.610
 percent 

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:09.599
 of course that was already there 

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:11.819
 would aftertaste though 

00:00:11.819 --> 00:00:14.589
 by Anna also seen side by side longer 

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:16.679
 we are warned we must be wide awake 

00:00:16.679 --> 00:00:20.199
 meanwhile, are shown for Saturday and highlighted 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:23.859
 in the case of the three individuals must be very very careful 

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:25.899
 integrate into the game 

00:00:25.899 --> 00:00:29.739
 3 0 Data means the duel Sampdoria 4 0 would have had to win 

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:30.649
 come 

00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:32.630
 and now ranged 2 0 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:34.060
 and so understand 

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:35.780
 and percent 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.140
 so the tent was so annoying 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.030
 and percent 

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.230
 that in the end, however, is not so annoying for me as it is for me 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:43.800
 think 

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.100
 a 3 0 we would have all stood and said years are already safe 

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.760
 The next round and then warmer Darnell will insist on the danger 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:55.140
 so maybe the flippier 11s maybe or the rights to suspense and the sun 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.120
 I am with the result, but then be satisfied because between 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.590
 "It's a tough game, it's going to have to be focused 

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:06.049
 and we our team fought the country will become its pursuers 1 

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:08.789
 Our team was always best when they played when they did 

00:01:08.789 --> 00:01:12.539
 is demanded Â»annoying it was know performance of us is everyone admitted 

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:13.000
 to have 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.050
 He will not leave Costa Rica 

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:19.780
 In general, are quite well confessed and little approved and is expensive but 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.560
 clear for south and educators that drove up to the mood that 

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.180
 you realize but we are very very satisfied 

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.470
 with the prelude of her 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:32.780
 did not know exactly what happened after the cup match in Ahlen 

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.840
 certainly a nice experience to win there anyway 

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.350
 around 

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.320
 but you felt from the first note that they were playful as well 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.380
 militant meet at the height are 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:43.420
 and 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:44.500
 wanted this victory 

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:47.450
 I had actually expected that percent but I think that up 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:49.870
 On the right side, he is already babies fit in 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:51.020
 ricochet 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.070
 Then came the landlord Jena and renovations Euro surprised 

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:59.040
 how free I then came to the shot on the pond on the ground under pleased 

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.060
 Naturally 

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.820
 Clearly to have such a format 

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.700
 that's the way it is, because everything is about improving pay channels on football 

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:06.550
 continue 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:10.790
 Of course, try to be careful of the goal and make it 

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:12.859
 pulls their picture said Hartmann 

00:02:12.859 --> 00:02:16.810
 one has seen that then in part then usually ten then Zetti percent 

00:02:16.809 --> 00:02:19.909
 defended and waited for their counter chances 

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:23.469
 We actually played it very very well - first time has a little bit 

00:02:23.469 --> 00:02:25.069
 Already allowed 

00:02:25.069 --> 00:02:28.709
 but also early attacked again to conquer the balls that has 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:31.099
 worked very well in level 12 

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:34.969
 and 10 all have to adjust to the fact that we had opponents on Tuesday 

00:02:34.969 --> 00:02:36.159
 to get 

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:39.159
 He will not get that opponent any more 

00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:42.909
 he has more attacking would try more 

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:44.309
 we have to try 

00:02:44.309 --> 00:02:45.559
 very nice 

00:02:45.559 --> 00:02:46.779
 to heal completely 

00:02:46.779 --> 00:02:49.759
 we have to say percent to Scott like that 

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:52.919
 Who will be very vigilant last year before I have two Hamas in Udine 

00:02:52.919 --> 00:02:54.680
 relate to 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:57.680
 how fast then this year son plays hats can tilt 

00:02:58.189 --> 00:03:01.759
 so it is all the more important because I think we are warned 

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:04.029
 we know what to expect 

00:03:04.029 --> 00:03:08.099
 also experience and when our performance bring focused play 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:11.339
 and percent then I am also that we the next round only slip above 

00:03:11.339 --> 00:03:12.299
 was 

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:15.439
 to 3 1 again that we will have concentrated percent to start up 

00:03:15.439 --> 00:03:18.509
 No, we can certainly say more, okay, we have now 

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:20.949
 the two-gate lead but 

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:22.389
 we still need it 

00:03:22.389 --> 00:03:24.529
 Good performance also abroad 

00:03:24.529 --> 00:03:27.529
 I've always said that I'm a player if that 

00:03:29.029 --> 00:03:32.199
 of course I was pleased to be able to complete his fitness 

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:36.729
 Preparing for the competition was good for me and percent off me now 

00:03:36.729 --> 00:03:37.689
 finally the 

00:03:37.689 --> 00:03:39.459
 this sum must be the FN percent 

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:42.609
 Carbon difficult tasks in the weeks ahead of us and 

00:03:42.609 --> 00:03:45.559
 Of course, he is still good with one percent positive 

00:03:45.559 --> 00:03:47.769
 felt or experience mobile phone 

00:03:47.769 --> 00:03:49.099
 Song to start 

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:52.099
 Percent after that, as a very interesting player 

00:03:52.799 --> 00:03:56.250
 that under contract with Olympique Marseille and Tones and no good at 

00:03:56.249 --> 00:03:58.009
 Start and percent 

00:03:58.009 --> 00:03:59.519
 therefore 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:03.840
 the hottest that is clear that such rumors arise percent we know 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.139
 where customers do not percent this position 

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:09.020
 the offensive player and percent 

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:12.770
 because what he said there we think that we are very well placed 

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:13.749
 are 

00:04:13.749 --> 00:04:15.310
 these are two of the country list 

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:16.779
 try to do that 

00:04:16.779 --> 00:04:20.699
 Percent of the allowed could play a bit more comprehensive 

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:22.879
 while being a versatile player is like that 

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:25.210
 Percent of Bayer is that's not a hot track
