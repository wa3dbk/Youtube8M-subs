every<00:01:59.580> time<00:01:59.820> I<00:02:00.150> slice<00:02:00.600> in<00:02:00.810> that<00:02:00.990> chicken

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
every time I slice in that chicken

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:03.020 
every time I slice in that chicken
breast<00:02:01.500> and<00:02:01.770> then<00:02:01.950> like<00:02:02.100> the<00:02:02.220> actual<00:02:02.520> slices

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
breast and then like the actual slices

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.970

of<00:02:03.150> chicken<00:02:03.270> aren't<00:02:03.720> all<00:02:03.870> coated<00:02:04.290> in<00:02:04.410> the

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:04.980

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:07.010 
of chicken aren't all coated in the
seasoning<00:02:05.430> so<00:02:05.550> that's<00:02:05.730> why<00:02:05.910> I<00:02:05.940> like<00:02:06.270> to<00:02:06.420> cut<00:02:06.930> up

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
seasoning so that's why I like to cut up

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.080 
seasoning so that's why I like to cut up
ahead<00:02:07.380> of<00:02:07.500> time<00:02:07.680> and<00:02:07.890> that<00:02:07.950> way<00:02:08.489> every<00:02:08.849> little

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
ahead of time and that way every little

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.270 
ahead of time and that way every little
bite<00:02:09.270> it's<00:02:10.080> got<00:02:10.200> all<00:02:10.320> that<00:02:10.350> flavoring<00:02:10.950> on<00:02:11.130> it

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
bite it's got all that flavoring on it

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.880 
bite it's got all that flavoring on it
so<00:02:11.520> just<00:02:12.480> take<00:02:12.720> a<00:02:12.750> minute<00:02:13.110> to<00:02:13.260> coat<00:02:13.530> it<00:02:13.650> really

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890
