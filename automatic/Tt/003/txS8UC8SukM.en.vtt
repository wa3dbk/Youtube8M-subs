hey<00:00:00.359> guys<00:00:00.570> flubber<00:00:00.989> leaky<00:00:01.260> here<00:00:01.410> again<00:00:01.620> with

00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:01.740 
hey guys flubber leaky here again with

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:03.439 
hey guys flubber leaky here again with
another<00:00:01.770> redstone<00:00:02.340> tutorial<00:00:02.760> and<00:00:03.270> today

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:03.449 
another redstone tutorial and today

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:05.180 
another redstone tutorial and today
we're<00:00:03.659> going<00:00:03.750> to<00:00:03.840> be<00:00:03.899> covering<00:00:04.259> pistons<00:00:04.920> and

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:05.190 
we're going to be covering pistons and

00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.390 
we're going to be covering pistons and
how<00:00:05.790> to<00:00:05.850> create<00:00:06.089> a<00:00:06.120> basic<00:00:06.420> piston<00:00:06.960> door<00:00:07.400> and

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
how to create a basic piston door and

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.200 
how to create a basic piston door and
how<00:00:09.030> it<00:00:09.120> works<00:00:09.300> pretty<00:00:09.480> much<00:00:09.599> so<00:00:10.070> firstly

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:11.210 
how it works pretty much so firstly

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:13.879 
how it works pretty much so firstly
we're<00:00:12.210> going<00:00:12.240> to<00:00:12.389> go<00:00:12.480> the<00:00:12.780> the<00:00:12.809> very<00:00:13.469> essential

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
we're going to go the the very essential

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:16.519 
we're going to go the the very essential
powering<00:00:14.549> of<00:00:14.670> a<00:00:14.730> piston<00:00:15.260> just<00:00:16.260> like<00:00:16.379> this

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:16.529 
powering of a piston just like this

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:18.680 
powering of a piston just like this
connects<00:00:16.980> and<00:00:17.160> register<00:00:17.430> into<00:00:17.640> it<00:00:17.760> and<00:00:17.940> apply

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.690 
connects and register into it and apply

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:20.689 
connects and register into it and apply
a<00:00:18.720> power<00:00:18.990> source<00:00:19.320> which<00:00:19.500> can<00:00:19.650> be<00:00:19.710> a<00:00:19.770> torch<00:00:20.039> you

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:20.699 
a power source which can be a torch you

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.790 
a power source which can be a torch you
can<00:00:20.820> use<00:00:20.939> a<00:00:20.970> lever<00:00:21.270> you<00:00:21.570> can<00:00:22.230> use<00:00:22.470> a<00:00:22.500> pressure

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
can use a lever you can use a pressure

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.620 
can use a lever you can use a pressure
plate<00:00:22.980> or<00:00:23.670> you<00:00:23.880> can<00:00:24.000> use<00:00:24.119> a<00:00:24.150> button<00:00:24.420> of<00:00:24.600> course

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
plate or you can use a button of course

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:27.349 
plate or you can use a button of course
so<00:00:25.470> now<00:00:26.220> that<00:00:26.279> we<00:00:26.430> know<00:00:26.460> that<00:00:26.699> we're<00:00:27.180> going<00:00:27.300> to

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
so now that we know that we're going to

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.630 
so now that we know that we're going to
create<00:00:27.510> our<00:00:27.570> door<00:00:28.279> we're<00:00:29.279> going<00:00:29.400> to<00:00:29.460> make<00:00:29.550> our

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
create our door we're going to make our

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.009 
create our door we're going to make our
door<00:00:29.789> too<00:00:29.970> high<00:00:30.119> so<00:00:30.330> basically<00:00:30.689> what's<00:00:30.929> going

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:31.019 
door too high so basically what's going

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:32.900 
door too high so basically what's going
to<00:00:31.080> happen<00:00:31.320> here<00:00:31.529> is<00:00:31.710> we're<00:00:32.610> gonna<00:00:32.700> have<00:00:32.820> the

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
to happen here is we're gonna have the

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:34.430 
to happen here is we're gonna have the
Pistons<00:00:33.239> like<00:00:33.329> this<00:00:33.540> and<00:00:33.840> they're<00:00:34.260> going<00:00:34.350> to

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
Pistons like this and they're going to

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.380 
Pistons like this and they're going to
close<00:00:34.620> on<00:00:34.800> in<00:00:34.950> on<00:00:35.160> each<00:00:35.460> other<00:00:35.579> with<00:00:36.059> some

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
close on in on each other with some

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.049 
close on in on each other with some
blocks<00:00:36.600> of<00:00:36.750> course<00:00:36.899> so<00:00:37.550> when<00:00:38.550> the<00:00:38.640> Pistons<00:00:38.940> are

00:00:39.049 --> 00:00:39.059 
blocks of course so when the Pistons are

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:40.639 
blocks of course so when the Pistons are
all<00:00:39.480> activated<00:00:39.840> they'll<00:00:40.050> closing<00:00:40.410> together

00:00:40.639 --> 00:00:40.649 
all activated they'll closing together

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:42.440 
all activated they'll closing together
and<00:00:40.860> seal<00:00:41.129> it<00:00:41.280> off<00:00:41.370> so<00:00:41.969> this<00:00:42.120> is<00:00:42.210> the<00:00:42.300> most

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
and seal it off so this is the most

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.810 
and seal it off so this is the most
basic<00:00:42.600> piston<00:00:43.140> door<00:00:43.320> of<00:00:44.309> course<00:00:44.489> you<00:00:44.670> don't

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:44.820 
basic piston door of course you don't

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.639 
basic piston door of course you don't
have<00:00:44.910> to<00:00:45.030> use<00:00:45.149> too<00:00:45.480> you<00:00:46.050> can<00:00:46.170> you<00:00:46.350> can<00:00:46.440> do<00:00:46.530> with

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
have to use too you can you can do with

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.220 
have to use too you can you can do with
one<00:00:46.890> and<00:00:47.100> have<00:00:47.789> it<00:00:47.820> just<00:00:48.149> a<00:00:48.239> wall<00:00:48.450> here<00:00:48.750> as<00:00:48.870> well

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
one and have it just a wall here as well

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.200 
one and have it just a wall here as well
that<00:00:49.410> works<00:00:49.739> you<00:00:49.920> can<00:00:50.190> have<00:00:50.370> a<00:00:50.399> piston<00:00:50.760> piston

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
that works you can have a piston piston

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.389 
that works you can have a piston piston
door<00:00:51.449> like<00:00:51.570> that<00:00:51.690> so<00:00:51.840> close<00:00:52.050> it<00:00:52.170> off<00:00:52.289> but<00:00:53.039> we're

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399 
door like that so close it off but we're

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:54.560 
door like that so close it off but we're
going<00:00:53.489> to<00:00:53.550> do<00:00:53.670> it<00:00:53.730> with<00:00:53.850> two<00:00:54.059> today<00:00:54.239> just

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:54.570 
going to do it with two today just

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.500 
going to do it with two today just
because<00:00:54.719> well<00:00:55.260> for<00:00:55.530> today<00:00:55.800> technically<00:00:56.510> just

00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:57.510 
because well for today technically just

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:59.510 
because well for today technically just
because<00:00:57.809> it's<00:00:57.989> just<00:00:58.140> a<00:00:58.320> nice<00:00:58.800> double<00:00:59.129> kind<00:00:59.460> of

00:00:59.510 --> 00:00:59.520 
because it's just a nice double kind of

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:02.150 
because it's just a nice double kind of
entrance<00:00:59.760> we<00:01:00.059> got<00:01:00.210> there<00:01:00.390> so<00:01:01.109> now<00:01:01.800> a<00:01:01.859> funny

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.160 
entrance we got there so now a funny

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.740 
entrance we got there so now a funny
thing<00:01:02.340> that<00:01:02.370> happens<00:01:02.760> with<00:01:02.879> pistons<00:01:03.239> is<00:01:03.449> you

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
thing that happens with pistons is you

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.780 
thing that happens with pistons is you
can<00:01:03.870> actually<00:01:04.140> power<00:01:04.320> two<00:01:04.979> of<00:01:05.100> them<00:01:05.250> with<00:01:05.580> only

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:05.790 
can actually power two of them with only

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.390 
can actually power two of them with only
one<00:01:05.939> signal<00:01:06.260> and<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.530> way<00:01:07.619> we<00:01:07.770> can<00:01:07.860> do<00:01:07.950> that<00:01:08.070> is

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
one signal and the way we can do that is

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.390 
one signal and the way we can do that is
by<00:01:08.939> just<00:01:09.240> powering<00:01:10.110> the<00:01:10.229> top<00:01:10.409> piston<00:01:10.830> the<00:01:11.220> top

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:11.400 
by just powering the top piston the top

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.850 
by just powering the top piston the top
piston<00:01:11.970> of<00:01:12.090> the<00:01:12.119> two<00:01:12.390> so<00:01:13.170> as<00:01:13.260> soon<00:01:13.409> as<00:01:13.500> we<00:01:13.560> power

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
piston of the two so as soon as we power

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.039 
piston of the two so as soon as we power
that<00:01:14.040> top<00:01:14.220> piston<00:01:14.610> it<00:01:15.509> actually<00:01:15.840> activates

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
that top piston it actually activates

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:17.359 
that top piston it actually activates
both<00:01:16.350> of<00:01:16.439> them<00:01:16.530> which<00:01:16.680> is<00:01:16.799> really<00:01:16.830> convenient

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
both of them which is really convenient

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:19.609 
both of them which is really convenient
because<00:01:17.909> it<00:01:18.119> makes<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.479> job<00:01:18.509> a<00:01:18.659> lot<00:01:18.960> easier<00:01:19.320> to

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:19.619 
because it makes the job a lot easier to

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:22.580 
because it makes the job a lot easier to
work<00:01:20.310> with<00:01:20.509> so<00:01:21.509> now<00:01:21.630> all<00:01:22.020> we<00:01:22.170> got<00:01:22.290> to<00:01:22.380> do<00:01:22.439> from

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:22.590 
work with so now all we got to do from

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:24.080 
work with so now all we got to do from
this<00:01:22.740> point<00:01:22.920> forward<00:01:23.189> is<00:01:23.340> actually<00:01:23.610> just<00:01:23.729> wire

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:24.090 
this point forward is actually just wire

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:26.450 
this point forward is actually just wire
off<00:01:24.299> a<00:01:24.450> pressure<00:01:24.780> plate<00:01:25.080> and<00:01:25.259> what<00:01:26.220> we<00:01:26.280> can<00:01:26.369> do

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
off a pressure plate and what we can do

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:28.100 
off a pressure plate and what we can do
we<00:01:26.670> can<00:01:26.820> link<00:01:27.119> the<00:01:27.299> circuit<00:01:27.630> because<00:01:27.869> you<00:01:27.930> want

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
we can link the circuit because you want

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.480 
we can link the circuit because you want
them<00:01:28.229> both<00:01:28.350> to<00:01:28.409> be<00:01:28.680> activated<00:01:28.979> at<00:01:29.189> the<00:01:29.280> same

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:29.490 
them both to be activated at the same

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:31.219 
them both to be activated at the same
time<00:01:29.700> and<00:01:29.939> we're<00:01:30.750> going<00:01:30.869> to<00:01:30.930> put<00:01:31.020> a<00:01:31.049> pressure

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
time and we're going to put a pressure

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:33.950 
time and we're going to put a pressure
plate<00:01:31.409> right<00:01:31.890> about<00:01:32.130> here<00:01:32.570> however<00:01:33.570> there<00:01:33.869> is

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
plate right about here however there is

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.569 
plate right about here however there is
one<00:01:33.990> problem<00:01:34.350> with<00:01:34.619> this<00:01:34.710> and<00:01:34.950> you<00:01:35.130> may<00:01:35.280> have

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
one problem with this and you may have

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.069 
one problem with this and you may have
already<00:01:35.880> noticed<00:01:36.030> it<00:01:36.360> as<00:01:36.450> soon<00:01:36.600> as<00:01:36.659> I<00:01:36.780> step<00:01:36.960> on

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
already noticed it as soon as I step on

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:38.840 
already noticed it as soon as I step on
this<00:01:37.229> the<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.619> circuits<00:01:38.280> can<00:01:38.369> be<00:01:38.520> activated

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
this the the circuits can be activated

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.039 
this the the circuits can be activated
and<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.180> Pistons<00:01:39.450> actually<00:01:39.659> going<00:01:39.750> to<00:01:39.840> close

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
and the Pistons actually going to close

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.980 
and the Pistons actually going to close
which<00:01:40.950> is<00:01:41.130> not<00:01:41.490> what<00:01:41.670> we<00:01:41.790> want<00:01:41.970> so<00:01:42.689> basically

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
which is not what we want so basically

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.569 
which is not what we want so basically
we<00:01:43.170> need<00:01:43.320> to<00:01:43.409> create<00:01:43.560> an<00:01:43.680> inverter<00:01:43.950> and<00:01:44.130> for

00:01:44.569 --> 00:01:44.579 
we need to create an inverter and for

00:01:44.579 --> 00:01:45.830 
we need to create an inverter and for
the<00:01:44.640> purposes<00:01:44.970> of<00:01:45.090> this<00:01:45.210> video<00:01:45.360> I'm<00:01:45.630> going<00:01:45.750> to

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
the purposes of this video I'm going to

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:48.139 
the purposes of this video I'm going to
create<00:01:46.049> it<00:01:46.170> right<00:01:46.350> here<00:01:46.979> just<00:01:47.189> so<00:01:47.790> you<00:01:47.850> can<00:01:47.939> see

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
create it right here just so you can see

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:50.090 
create it right here just so you can see
it<00:01:48.270> and<00:01:48.450> I'm<00:01:49.170> going<00:01:49.350> to<00:01:49.380> I'm<00:01:49.619> going<00:01:49.649> to<00:01:49.799> make<00:01:49.979> it

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
it and I'm going to I'm going to make it

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.469 
it and I'm going to I'm going to make it
in<00:01:50.220> a<00:01:50.310> funky<00:01:50.640> kind<00:01:50.790> of<00:01:50.880> wave<00:01:50.970> just<00:01:51.180> like<00:01:51.270> this

00:01:51.469 --> 00:01:51.479 
in a funky kind of wave just like this

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:54.139 
in a funky kind of wave just like this
thing<00:01:51.600> we've<00:01:51.689> got<00:01:51.810> two<00:01:52.049> torches<00:01:52.409> on<00:01:52.530> it<00:01:52.649> and<00:01:53.149> do

00:01:54.139 --> 00:01:54.149 
thing we've got two torches on it and do

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:55.940 
thing we've got two torches on it and do
it<00:01:54.270> like<00:01:54.360> that<00:01:54.420> of<00:01:54.810> course<00:01:54.869> you<00:01:55.200> can<00:01:55.380> you<00:01:55.799> don't

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
it like that of course you can you don't

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:56.990 
it like that of course you can you don't
have<00:01:56.040> to<00:01:56.100> do<00:01:56.189> that<00:01:56.280> you<00:01:56.369> can<00:01:56.460> do<00:01:56.549> it<00:01:56.670> with<00:01:56.820> just

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
have to do that you can do it with just

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.039 
have to do that you can do it with just
one<00:01:57.119> torch<00:01:58.280> like<00:01:59.280> this<00:01:59.600> which<00:02:00.600> I<00:02:00.719> suppose<00:02:00.899> I'll

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
one torch like this which I suppose I'll

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:02.330 
one torch like this which I suppose I'll
leave<00:02:01.170> it<00:02:01.290> like<00:02:01.380> that<00:02:01.500> now<00:02:01.649> but<00:02:01.890> I<00:02:01.950> was<00:02:02.100> going

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
leave it like that now but I was going

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.520 
leave it like that now but I was going
to<00:02:02.399> use<00:02:02.520> two<00:02:02.670> just<00:02:02.909> because<00:02:03.000> just<00:02:03.990> easy<00:02:04.200> to<00:02:04.320> set

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
to use two just because just easy to set

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.260 
to use two just because just easy to set
up<00:02:04.560> so<00:02:05.250> basically<00:02:05.369> now<00:02:05.729> when<00:02:05.880> we<00:02:05.969> step<00:02:06.119> on<00:02:06.210> the

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:06.270 
up so basically now when we step on the

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:07.219 
up so basically now when we step on the
pressure<00:02:06.390> plate<00:02:06.540> the<00:02:06.750> door<00:02:06.899> actually<00:02:07.079> opens

00:02:07.219 --> 00:02:07.229 
pressure plate the door actually opens

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:08.900 
pressure plate the door actually opens
however<00:02:08.039> you<00:02:08.129> notice<00:02:08.250> we<00:02:08.399> can't<00:02:08.670> actually

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:08.910 
however you notice we can't actually

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:11.660 
however you notice we can't actually
access<00:02:09.840> it<00:02:09.869> from<00:02:10.050> this<00:02:10.229> side

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
access it from this side

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:13.250 
access it from this side
so<00:02:12.120> essentially<00:02:12.390> what<00:02:12.629> we<00:02:12.810> need<00:02:12.959> to<00:02:13.050> set<00:02:13.230> up

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:13.260 
so essentially what we need to set up

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:15.530 
so essentially what we need to set up
here<00:02:13.530> now<00:02:13.680> is<00:02:13.950> we<00:02:14.550> need<00:02:14.580> to<00:02:14.760> activate<00:02:15.180> this

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:15.540 
here now is we need to activate this

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.710 
here now is we need to activate this
inverter<00:02:16.019> from<00:02:16.819> two<00:02:17.819> pressure<00:02:18.209> plates<00:02:18.510> or

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:18.720 
inverter from two pressure plates or

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:21.530 
inverter from two pressure plates or
another<00:02:19.200> power<00:02:19.470> source<00:02:20.090> and<00:02:21.090> the<00:02:21.209> way<00:02:21.300> we<00:02:21.420> can

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:21.540 
another power source and the way we can

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:22.790 
another power source and the way we can
do<00:02:21.599> that<00:02:21.629> we<00:02:21.840> should<00:02:22.019> move<00:02:22.140> this<00:02:22.290> back<00:02:22.530> of<00:02:22.680> it

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:22.800 
do that we should move this back of it

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.050 
do that we should move this back of it
just<00:02:22.980> give<00:02:23.129> us<00:02:23.220> a<00:02:23.310> bit<00:02:23.430> more<00:02:23.580> space<00:02:23.819> to<00:02:23.849> work

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:24.060 
just give us a bit more space to work

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:30.020 
just give us a bit more space to work
with<00:02:24.800> like<00:02:25.800> this<00:02:26.330> so<00:02:28.129> we'll<00:02:29.129> have<00:02:29.310> to<00:02:29.459> rewire

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:30.030 
with like this so we'll have to rewire

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.280 
with like this so we'll have to rewire
that<00:02:30.209> we<00:02:30.420> don't<00:02:30.599> want<00:02:30.720> any<00:02:30.870> of<00:02:30.930> these<00:02:31.019> wires

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
that we don't want any of these wires

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.289 
that we don't want any of these wires
touch<00:02:31.530> and<00:02:31.680> we<00:02:31.739> don't<00:02:31.920> want<00:02:32.069> the<00:02:32.190> on<00:02:32.790> wire<00:02:33.090> to

00:02:33.289 --> 00:02:33.299 
touch and we don't want the on wire to

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:35.059 
touch and we don't want the on wire to
touch<00:02:33.450> the<00:02:33.569> off<00:02:33.690> wire<00:02:33.900> here<00:02:34.140> because<00:02:34.470> that<00:02:34.830> is

00:02:35.059 --> 00:02:35.069 
touch the off wire here because that is

00:02:35.069 --> 00:02:38.390 
touch the off wire here because that is
not<00:02:35.280> the<00:02:35.940> way<00:02:36.090> we<00:02:36.330> should<00:02:36.959> do<00:02:37.080> it<00:02:37.200> so<00:02:38.190> if<00:02:38.280> we

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:38.400 
not the way we should do it so if we

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.280 
not the way we should do it so if we
just<00:02:38.519> set<00:02:38.640> this<00:02:38.730> up<00:02:38.849> like<00:02:38.910> this<00:02:39.239> give<00:02:40.019> us<00:02:40.080> a<00:02:40.170> bit

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
just set this up like this give us a bit

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.819 
just set this up like this give us a bit
more<00:02:40.410> space<00:02:40.620> to<00:02:40.799> work<00:02:40.920> with<00:02:40.980> there<00:02:42.560> we<00:02:43.560> need<00:02:43.709> to

00:02:43.819 --> 00:02:43.829 
more space to work with there we need to

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:46.120 
more space to work with there we need to
also<00:02:44.250> connect<00:02:44.519> this<00:02:44.670> this<00:02:44.970> signal<00:02:45.329> here<00:02:45.630> up<00:02:45.750> to

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:46.130 
also connect this this signal here up to

00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:48.770 
also connect this this signal here up to
another<00:02:47.130> powers<00:02:47.610> power<00:02:48.209> source<00:02:48.420> on<00:02:48.540> the<00:02:48.660> other

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780 
another powers power source on the other

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.240 
another powers power source on the other
side<00:02:48.989> so<00:02:49.230> we're<00:02:49.560> actually<00:02:49.709> just<00:02:49.950> going<00:02:50.040> to<00:02:50.099> dig

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
side so we're actually just going to dig

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:51.880 
side so we're actually just going to dig
it<00:02:50.340> out<00:02:50.430> on<00:02:50.519> the<00:02:50.610> ground<00:02:50.819> real<00:02:51.209> quick

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:51.890 
it out on the ground real quick

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
it out on the ground real quick
it's<00:02:52.890> going<00:02:53.010> to<00:02:53.069> make<00:02:53.160> it<00:02:53.250> go<00:02:53.280> under<00:02:53.640> because

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
it's going to make it go under because

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:55.670 
it's going to make it go under because
we<00:02:54.060> need<00:02:54.239> it<00:02:54.390> to<00:02:54.660> be<00:02:54.930> activated<00:02:55.290> over<00:02:55.530> this

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:55.680 
we need it to be activated over this

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:57.830 
we need it to be activated over this
side<00:02:55.860> as<00:02:55.950> well<00:02:56.099> and<00:02:57.060> of<00:02:57.420> course<00:02:57.450> we're<00:02:57.720> just

00:02:57.830 --> 00:02:57.840 
side as well and of course we're just

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.080 
side as well and of course we're just
going<00:02:57.959> to<00:02:58.019> bring<00:02:58.140> it<00:02:58.290> back<00:02:58.410> up<00:02:58.620> just<00:02:59.000> so<00:03:00.000> you

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.090 
going to bring it back up just so you

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:01.670 
going to bring it back up just so you
can<00:03:00.209> see<00:03:00.420> it<00:03:00.540> if<00:03:01.079> we<00:03:01.200> put<00:03:01.349> a<00:03:01.379> pressure<00:03:01.560> plate

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:01.680 
can see it if we put a pressure plate

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.380 
can see it if we put a pressure plate
here<00:03:01.890> now<00:03:02.040> it<00:03:02.459> will<00:03:02.610> also<00:03:02.760> open<00:03:02.879> from<00:03:03.239> this

00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:03.390 
here now it will also open from this

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:07.009 
here now it will also open from this
side<00:03:03.569> and<00:03:04.190> this<00:03:05.190> one<00:03:05.340> opens<00:03:05.640> it<00:03:05.760> too<00:03:05.930> and<00:03:06.930> of

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
side and this one opens it too and of

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:07.699 
side and this one opens it too and of
course<00:03:07.170> we're<00:03:07.290> going<00:03:07.410> to<00:03:07.470> put<00:03:07.560> another

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
course we're going to put another

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:08.750 
course we're going to put another
pressure<00:03:07.950> plate<00:03:08.129> here<00:03:08.400> with<00:03:08.610> another

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
pressure plate here with another

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:10.250 
pressure plate here with another
redstone<00:03:09.150> signal<00:03:09.299> we<00:03:09.569> can<00:03:09.599> use<00:03:09.810> either<00:03:10.019> of

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
redstone signal we can use either of

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.500 
redstone signal we can use either of
them<00:03:10.379> now<00:03:10.549> we<00:03:11.549> can<00:03:11.700> do<00:03:11.760> the<00:03:11.879> same<00:03:12.000> thing<00:03:12.239> right

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
them now we can do the same thing right

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.449 
them now we can do the same thing right
here<00:03:12.690> as<00:03:12.810> well<00:03:12.989> so<00:03:13.560> now<00:03:13.680> we<00:03:13.739> have<00:03:13.950> all<00:03:14.310> these

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
here as well so now we have all these

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:16.009 
here as well so now we have all these
fresh<00:03:14.670> place<00:03:14.879> open<00:03:15.209> up<00:03:15.299> now<00:03:15.840> there's

00:03:16.009 --> 00:03:16.019 
fresh place open up now there's

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:17.599 
fresh place open up now there's
obviously<00:03:16.079> one<00:03:16.500> big<00:03:16.650> floor<00:03:16.889> with<00:03:17.040> this<00:03:17.100> is<00:03:17.340> the

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:17.609 
obviously one big floor with this is the

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:18.740 
obviously one big floor with this is the
fact<00:03:17.790> that<00:03:17.850> you<00:03:18.000> can<00:03:18.120> see<00:03:18.269> redstone

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
fact that you can see redstone

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.690 
fact that you can see redstone
everywhere<00:03:19.170> and<00:03:19.380> that<00:03:19.410> that's<00:03:20.190> not<00:03:20.340> what<00:03:20.579> we

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
everywhere and that that's not what we

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.670 
everywhere and that that's not what we
want<00:03:20.910> to<00:03:20.970> do<00:03:21.090> if<00:03:21.989> we're<00:03:22.230> building<00:03:22.530> this

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:22.680 
want to do if we're building this

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.229 
want to do if we're building this
secretly<00:03:23.340> we<00:03:23.609> don't<00:03:23.790> want<00:03:23.940> them<00:03:24.030> to<00:03:24.090> be<00:03:24.180> able

00:03:24.229 --> 00:03:24.239 
secretly we don't want them to be able

00:03:24.239 --> 00:03:26.240 
secretly we don't want them to be able
to<00:03:24.359> see<00:03:24.450> any<00:03:24.660> of<00:03:24.780> this<00:03:24.959> now<00:03:25.739> of<00:03:25.799> course<00:03:25.920> we<00:03:26.100> can

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:26.250 
to see any of this now of course we can

00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:27.500 
to see any of this now of course we can
neatness<00:03:26.579> all<00:03:26.730> up<00:03:26.880> and<00:03:27.030> put<00:03:27.090> it<00:03:27.269> underground

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:27.510 
neatness all up and put it underground

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.720 
neatness all up and put it underground
and<00:03:27.900> in<00:03:28.560> future<00:03:28.739> videos<00:03:28.859> we<00:03:29.310> will<00:03:29.459> be<00:03:29.609> doing

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:29.730 
and in future videos we will be doing

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.670 
and in future videos we will be doing
that<00:03:29.849> but<00:03:30.569> for<00:03:30.720> this<00:03:30.780> one<00:03:30.959> this<00:03:31.170> I'll<00:03:31.349> leave<00:03:31.590> it

00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:31.680 
that but for this one this I'll leave it

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.339 
that but for this one this I'll leave it
here<00:03:31.920> so<00:03:32.489> what<00:03:33.060> the<00:03:33.239> basics<00:03:33.569> of<00:03:33.630> your<00:03:33.690> got<00:03:34.319> to

00:03:34.339 --> 00:03:34.349 
here so what the basics of your got to

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:37.250 
here so what the basics of your got to
know<00:03:34.530> is<00:03:34.799> that<00:03:35.239> two<00:03:36.239> Pistons<00:03:36.660> can<00:03:36.870> be<00:03:36.959> powered

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:37.260 
know is that two Pistons can be powered

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.650 
know is that two Pistons can be powered
by<00:03:37.290> one<00:03:37.620> signal<00:03:38.099> going<00:03:38.730> to<00:03:38.849> the<00:03:38.940> top<00:03:39.180> piston

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
by one signal going to the top piston

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:42.650 
by one signal going to the top piston
and<00:03:40.040> a<00:03:41.040> pressure<00:03:41.579> plate<00:03:41.760> or<00:03:42.030> any<00:03:42.239> other<00:03:42.419> power

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660 
and a pressure plate or any other power

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:43.970 
and a pressure plate or any other power
source<00:03:42.840> you<00:03:42.930> can<00:03:43.079> use<00:03:43.200> a<00:03:43.230> lever<00:03:43.500> of<00:03:43.680> course<00:03:43.859> if

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
source you can use a lever of course if

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:45.319 
source you can use a lever of course if
you<00:03:44.069> really<00:03:44.099> want<00:03:44.489> you<00:03:44.639> put<00:03:44.760> a<00:03:44.819> lever<00:03:45.000> right<00:03:45.180> in

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:45.329 
you really want you put a lever right in

00:03:45.329 --> 00:03:47.870 
you really want you put a lever right in
front<00:03:45.480> of<00:03:45.540> it<00:03:45.709> so<00:03:46.709> any<00:03:47.040> power<00:03:47.250> source<00:03:47.400> every

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:47.880 
front of it so any power source every

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:52.520 
front of it so any power source every
150<00:03:48.480> of<00:03:48.810> course<00:03:50.690> basically<00:03:51.690> we<00:03:51.810> need<00:03:51.989> that<00:03:52.109> we

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
150 of course basically we need that we

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.680 
150 of course basically we need that we
need<00:03:52.560> that<00:03:52.829> to<00:03:52.950> go<00:03:53.040> through<00:03:53.069> an<00:03:53.340> inverter<00:03:54.239> to

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
need that to go through an inverter to

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:56.390 
need that to go through an inverter to
invert<00:03:54.989> the<00:03:55.079> signal<00:03:55.410> so<00:03:55.530> the<00:03:55.650> Pistons<00:03:56.010> are<00:03:56.220> on

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
invert the signal so the Pistons are on

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.069 
invert the signal so the Pistons are on
when<00:03:57.150> nobody<00:03:57.510> is<00:03:57.540> trying<00:03:57.690> to<00:03:57.780> go<00:03:57.870> through<00:03:57.989> the

00:03:58.069 --> 00:03:58.079 
when nobody is trying to go through the

00:03:58.079 --> 00:04:00.620 
when nobody is trying to go through the
door<00:03:58.260> and<00:03:58.440> the<00:03:58.919> Pistons<00:03:59.250> are<00:03:59.370> off<00:03:59.630> when

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:00.630 
door and the Pistons are off when

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:03.050 
door and the Pistons are off when
somebody's<00:04:00.959> trying<00:04:01.049> to<00:04:01.200> go<00:04:01.260> through<00:04:02.060> so

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:03.060 
somebody's trying to go through so

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:04.640 
somebody's trying to go through so
that's<00:04:03.239> the<00:04:03.299> basics<00:04:03.599> of<00:04:03.690> this<00:04:03.810> probably<00:04:04.560> in

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
that's the basics of this probably in

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:06.170 
that's the basics of this probably in
the<00:04:04.709> next<00:04:04.889> video<00:04:05.069> we'll<00:04:05.220> go<00:04:05.340> over<00:04:05.370> how<00:04:05.880> to

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:06.180 
the next video we'll go over how to

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.300 
the next video we'll go over how to
neaten<00:04:06.630> and<00:04:06.720> all<00:04:06.810> our<00:04:06.989> pile<00:04:07.230> it<00:04:07.380> away<00:04:07.620> make<00:04:08.190> it

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
neaten and all our pile it away make it

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:09.080 
neaten and all our pile it away make it
look<00:04:08.459> a<00:04:08.549> bit<00:04:08.579> nicer

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:09.090 
look a bit nicer

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:11.120 
look a bit nicer
so<00:04:09.660> until<00:04:09.870> then<00:04:10.019> guys<00:04:10.169> I'm<00:04:10.410> flubber<00:04:10.650> leaky<00:04:10.950> and

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:11.130 
so until then guys I'm flubber leaky and

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:26.330 
so until then guys I'm flubber leaky and
thanks<00:04:11.669> for<00:04:11.760> watching

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340
