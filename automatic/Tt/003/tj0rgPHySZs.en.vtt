hello<00:00:00.450> YouTube<00:00:00.930> Ethan<00:00:01.410> D<00:00:01.530> here<00:00:02.149> today<00:00:03.149> I'm

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:03.300 
hello YouTube Ethan D here today I'm

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:04.820 
hello YouTube Ethan D here today I'm
going<00:00:03.480> to<00:00:03.540> teach<00:00:03.720> you<00:00:03.780> how<00:00:03.990> to<00:00:04.020> solve<00:00:04.410> this

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:04.830 
going to teach you how to solve this

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.760 
going to teach you how to solve this
gear<00:00:05.310> shift<00:00:05.730> if<00:00:06.720> you<00:00:06.870> look<00:00:07.080> at<00:00:07.170> the<00:00:07.319> working

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:07.770 
gear shift if you look at the working

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.860 
gear shift if you look at the working
mechanisms<00:00:08.370> and<00:00:08.519> how<00:00:08.580> it<00:00:08.790> turns<00:00:09.090> you<00:00:09.719> may

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:09.870 
mechanisms and how it turns you may

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.020 
mechanisms and how it turns you may
realize<00:00:10.349> that<00:00:10.620> it's<00:00:10.769> pretty<00:00:11.010> similar<00:00:11.340> to<00:00:11.730> this

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
realize that it's pretty similar to this

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.560 
realize that it's pretty similar to this
gear<00:00:12.540> cube<00:00:12.900> and<00:00:13.889> then<00:00:14.009> I<00:00:14.070> was<00:00:14.370> it<00:00:14.849> actually<00:00:15.210> is

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
gear cube and then I was it actually is

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:16.970 
gear cube and then I was it actually is
it's<00:00:15.780> based<00:00:16.020> off<00:00:16.199> the<00:00:16.379> same<00:00:16.590> general

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
it's based off the same general

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.310 
it's based off the same general
mechanism<00:00:17.520> where<00:00:18.000> you<00:00:18.029> move<00:00:18.390> one<00:00:18.660> piece<00:00:18.960> and

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
mechanism where you move one piece and

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.439 
mechanism where you move one piece and
loved<00:00:20.100> ones<00:00:20.400> around<00:00:20.580> it<00:00:20.970> move<00:00:21.470> with<00:00:22.470> it<00:00:23.449> one

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
loved ones around it move with it one

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.540 
loved ones around it move with it one
major<00:00:24.779> difference<00:00:25.140> this<00:00:25.529> has<00:00:25.590> that<00:00:26.189> the<00:00:26.369> gear

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
major difference this has that the gear

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.320 
major difference this has that the gear
dude<00:00:26.789> doesn't<00:00:27.260> say<00:00:28.260> I<00:00:28.289> can<00:00:28.590> do<00:00:28.740> it<00:00:28.830> you<00:00:28.949> can

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:29.330 
dude doesn't say I can do it you can

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.600 
dude doesn't say I can do it you can
click<00:00:30.330> it<00:00:30.480> open<00:00:30.720> like<00:00:30.840> this<00:00:31.050> and<00:00:31.260> turn<00:00:32.219> each

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
click it open like this and turn each

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.100 
click it open like this and turn each
side<00:00:33.000> individual<00:00:33.719> you<00:00:34.680> can<00:00:34.890> do<00:00:35.040> that<00:00:35.190> going<00:00:35.670> up

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:36.110 
side individual you can do that going up

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:44.110 
side individual you can do that going up
into<00:00:37.110> the<00:00:37.260> side<00:00:38.100> and<00:00:39.290> front<00:00:40.290> him<00:00:40.530> back<00:00:42.530> but

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:44.120 
into the side and front him back but

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.090 
into the side and front him back but
we're<00:00:45.120> here<00:00:45.300> for<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.570> solve<00:00:45.840> so<00:00:46.500> go<00:00:46.890> ahead<00:00:47.010> and

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:47.100 
we're here for the solve so go ahead and

00:00:47.100 --> 00:01:03.590 
we're here for the solve so go ahead and
mess<00:00:47.610> up<00:00:47.640> your<00:00:47.850> gear<00:00:48.480> shift<00:01:01.430> okay<00:01:02.430> there<00:01:03.059> we<00:01:03.180> go

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
mess up your gear shift okay there we go

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:07.700 
mess up your gear shift okay there we go
so<00:01:04.199> first<00:01:05.010> step<00:01:05.810> what<00:01:06.810> you<00:01:06.840> want<00:01:07.049> to<00:01:07.140> do<00:01:07.260> you

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
so first step what you want to do you

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.109 
so first step what you want to do you
want<00:01:07.890> look<00:01:08.010> to<00:01:08.130> the<00:01:08.250> side<00:01:08.460> that<00:01:08.700> is<00:01:08.790> going<00:01:08.880> to

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
want look to the side that is going to

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.480 
want look to the side that is going to
be<00:01:09.210> the<00:01:09.390> URI<00:01:09.780> yellow<00:01:10.110> side<00:01:10.439> or<00:01:10.650> whatever<00:01:11.250> side

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
be the URI yellow side or whatever side

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.219 
be the URI yellow side or whatever side
you<00:01:11.640> want<00:01:11.700> whatever<00:01:12.510> color<00:01:12.750> you<00:01:12.840> want<00:01:12.930> be<00:01:13.110> your

00:01:13.219 --> 00:01:13.229 
you want whatever color you want be your

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.649 
you want whatever color you want be your
top<00:01:13.470> side<00:01:13.740> so<00:01:14.610> in<00:01:14.729> this<00:01:14.820> case<00:01:15.119> it's<00:01:15.390> going<00:01:15.570> to

00:01:15.649 --> 00:01:15.659 
top side so in this case it's going to

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:17.600 
top side so in this case it's going to
be<00:01:15.720> the<00:01:15.960> this<00:01:16.350> side<00:01:16.650> because<00:01:17.100> if<00:01:17.220> you<00:01:17.340> notice

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
be the this side because if you notice

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:19.670 
be the this side because if you notice
this<00:01:17.820> one<00:01:17.880> is<00:01:18.030> young<00:01:18.390> this<00:01:18.990> one<00:01:19.200> has<00:01:19.350> yellow

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:19.680 
this one is young this one has yellow

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:22.190 
this one is young this one has yellow
this<00:01:20.310> one<00:01:20.549> is<00:01:20.640> yellow<00:01:20.939> and<00:01:21.150> this<00:01:21.750> one<00:01:21.930> is<00:01:22.020> young

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:22.200 
this one is yellow and this one is young

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.200 
this one is yellow and this one is young
so<00:01:22.830> that<00:01:22.979> would<00:01:23.100> mean<00:01:23.250> if<00:01:23.490> we<00:01:23.610> pull<00:01:23.850> this<00:01:23.970> up

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
so that would mean if we pull this up

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.810 
so that would mean if we pull this up
you<00:01:24.990> can<00:01:25.110> see<00:01:25.170> it<00:01:25.380> more<00:01:25.500> clear<00:01:26.009> this<00:01:26.340> side<00:01:26.640> is

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
you can see it more clear this side is

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.130 
you can see it more clear this side is
going<00:01:27.030> to<00:01:27.090> be<00:01:27.210> a<00:01:27.240> yellow<00:01:27.600> side<00:01:27.900> more<00:01:28.680> top<00:01:29.070> side

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:30.140 
going to be a yellow side more top side

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:32.920 
going to be a yellow side more top side
so<00:01:31.140> first<00:01:31.770> thing<00:01:31.920> what<00:01:32.009> you<00:01:32.159> want<00:01:32.340> to<00:01:32.400> do<00:01:32.490> is

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:32.930 
so first thing what you want to do is

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.020 
so first thing what you want to do is
take<00:01:33.930> you<00:01:34.049> from<00:01:34.140> any<00:01:34.409> angle<00:01:34.650> and<00:01:35.070> pull<00:01:35.880> it

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030 
take you from any angle and pull it

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.510 
take you from any angle and pull it
apart<00:01:36.150> so<00:01:37.020> there's<00:01:37.380> two<00:01:37.590> pieces<00:01:37.770> on<00:01:38.040> each<00:01:38.220> side

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
apart so there's two pieces on each side

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:42.230 
apart so there's two pieces on each side
then<00:01:39.390> you<00:01:39.509> want<00:01:39.689> to<00:01:39.780> spin<00:01:40.229> until<00:01:40.650> you<00:01:41.579> get<00:01:41.820> the

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
then you want to spin until you get the

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.539 
then you want to spin until you get the
matched<00:01:42.630> up<00:01:42.960> then<00:01:43.710> you<00:01:43.829> want<00:01:43.979> to<00:01:44.040> do<00:01:44.130> the<00:01:44.250> same

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
matched up then you want to do the same

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.649 
matched up then you want to do the same
to<00:01:44.880> the<00:01:44.970> other<00:01:45.000> side<00:01:46.490> spin<00:01:47.490> slowly<00:01:48.060> until<00:01:48.600> you

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
to the other side spin slowly until you

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:56.149 
to the other side spin slowly until you
get<00:01:49.110> to<00:01:49.920> match<00:01:50.310> up<00:01:53.149> there<00:01:54.149> we<00:01:54.240> go<00:01:54.500> so<00:01:55.500> next<00:01:55.950> what

00:01:56.149 --> 00:01:56.159 
get to match up there we go so next what

00:01:56.159 --> 00:01:58.039 
get to match up there we go so next what
you<00:01:56.280> want<00:01:56.460> to<00:01:56.549> do<00:01:56.670> is<00:01:57.240> you<00:01:57.329> want<00:01:57.479> to<00:01:57.540> pick<00:01:57.990> one

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
you want to do is you want to pick one

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:00.709 
you want to do is you want to pick one
of<00:01:58.439> these<00:01:58.560> faces<00:01:59.310> and<00:01:59.579> then<00:02:00.149> solve<00:02:00.390> that<00:02:00.570> one

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
of these faces and then solve that one

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.270 
of these faces and then solve that one
I'm<00:02:01.110> going<00:02:01.259> to<00:02:01.350> go<00:02:01.439> with<00:02:01.590> green<00:02:01.860> because<00:02:02.250> I

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
I'm going to go with green because I

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.190 
I'm going to go with green because I
like<00:02:02.700> green<00:02:03.000> better<00:02:03.450> than<00:02:03.719> all<00:02:03.840> these<00:02:03.990> other

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200 
like green better than all these other

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.010 
like green better than all these other
colors<00:02:04.469> you<00:02:04.799> pull<00:02:05.670> it<00:02:05.759> apart<00:02:05.850> this<00:02:06.420> solved

00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:07.020 
colors you pull it apart this solved

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.940 
colors you pull it apart this solved
side<00:02:07.229> is<00:02:07.380> on<00:02:07.530> your<00:02:08.039> left<00:02:08.840> and<00:02:09.840> your<00:02:10.110> unsolved

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
side is on your left and your unsolved

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.400 
side is on your left and your unsolved
side<00:02:11.160> is<00:02:11.310> on<00:02:11.430> your<00:02:11.550> right<00:02:11.730> then<00:02:12.450> you<00:02:12.569> turn<00:02:12.900> it

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
side is on your right then you turn it

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.110 
side is on your right then you turn it
take<00:02:13.800> it<00:02:13.920> a<00:02:13.980> match<00:02:14.160> like<00:02:14.460> that<00:02:14.490> and<00:02:14.910> then<00:02:15.030> you

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:15.120 
take it a match like that and then you

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:34.800 
big Q V clockwise as well what this one

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:38.330 
big Q V clockwise as well what this one
was<00:03:34.950> supposed<00:03:35.040> to<00:03:35.340> be<00:03:35.430> once<00:03:36.300> correct<00:03:37.070> then<00:03:38.070> if

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:38.340 
was supposed to be once correct then if

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.900 
was supposed to be once correct then if
you<00:03:38.580> see<00:03:38.850> it<00:03:39.030> should<00:03:39.390> be<00:03:40.310> back<00:03:41.310> to<00:03:41.490> normal

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
you see it should be back to normal

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:44.150 
you see it should be back to normal
press<00:03:42.450> it<00:03:42.630> back<00:03:42.660> in<00:03:42.989> and<00:03:43.200> there<00:03:43.920> you<00:03:43.950> go<00:03:44.130> now

this<00:03:44.370> little<00:03:44.940> cutie<00:03:45.660> is<00:03:45.780> solved<00:03:46.140> now<00:03:46.290> we'll<00:03:46.920> go

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040 
this little cutie is solved now we'll go

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:50.090 
this little cutie is solved now we'll go
on<00:03:47.130> to<00:03:47.250> this<00:03:47.400> one<00:03:47.660> so<00:03:48.660> this<00:03:49.350> one's<00:03:49.650> same<00:03:49.860> thing

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:50.100 
on to this one so this one's same thing

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:51.830 
on to this one so this one's same thing
you<00:03:50.220> want<00:03:50.370> to<00:03:50.430> remember<00:03:50.550> those<00:03:51.209> two<00:03:51.480> facts

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:51.840 
you want to remember those two facts

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.220 
you want to remember those two facts
this<00:03:52.770> one<00:03:53.040> one<00:03:53.370> two<00:03:53.760> two<00:03:54.060> the<00:03:54.870> get<00:03:54.989> to<00:03:55.110> the

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:55.230 
this one one two two the get to the

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:57.170 
this one one two two the get to the
right<00:03:55.320> spot<00:03:55.500> and<00:03:56.310> that's<00:03:56.400> turning<00:03:56.790> clockwise

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
right spot and that's turning clockwise

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.420 
right spot and that's turning clockwise
as<00:03:57.690> well<00:03:57.870> and<00:03:58.170> you<00:03:58.709> want<00:03:58.860> to<00:03:58.920> divide<00:03:59.130> that

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430 
as well and you want to divide that

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.750 
as well and you want to divide that
number<00:03:59.610> you<00:03:59.940> get<00:04:00.060> by<00:04:00.360> two<00:04:00.650> so<00:04:01.650> that<00:04:01.950> means<00:04:02.220> one

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:02.760 
number you get by two so that means one

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:03.790 
number you get by two so that means one
for<00:04:03.060> me

00:04:03.790 --> 00:04:03.800 
for me

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:08.690 
for me
so<00:04:04.800> then<00:04:05.160> pull<00:04:05.550> it<00:04:05.700> up<00:04:05.910> like<00:04:06.840> that<00:04:07.580> then<00:04:08.580> you

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:08.700 
so then pull it up like that then you

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.080 
so then pull it up like that then you
want<00:04:08.850> to<00:04:08.880> turn<00:04:09.030> this<00:04:09.270> cube

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:11.090 
want to turn this cube

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:15.260 
want to turn this cube
clockwise<00:04:12.650> until<00:04:13.650> this<00:04:14.220> one<00:04:14.520> turns<00:04:14.850> once

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:15.270 
clockwise until this one turns once

00:04:15.270 --> 00:04:19.130 
clockwise until this one turns once
around<00:04:15.770> like<00:04:16.770> that<00:04:16.980> then<00:04:17.910> you<00:04:18.030> want<00:04:18.180> to<00:04:18.299> break

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:19.140 
around like that then you want to break

00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:20.120
