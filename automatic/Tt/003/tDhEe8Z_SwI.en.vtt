through till it's all incorporated and

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:01.130 
through till it's all incorporated and
then<00:00:59.550> I'm<00:00:59.640> dividing<00:01:00.030> that<00:01:00.180> into<00:01:00.239> two<00:01:00.629> six-inch

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
then I'm dividing that into two six-inch

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.930 
then I'm dividing that into two six-inch
tins<00:01:01.620> and<00:01:01.859> I've<00:01:01.949> got<00:01:02.129> some<00:01:02.309> baking<00:01:02.579> paper<00:01:02.730> at

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
tins and I've got some baking paper at

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.789 
tins and I've got some baking paper at
the<00:01:03.030> bottom<00:01:03.270> of<00:01:03.359> my<00:01:03.390> tins<00:01:03.690> and<00:01:03.989> I<00:01:04.559> haven't

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
the bottom of my tins and I haven't

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.370 
the bottom of my tins and I haven't
sprayed<00:01:05.040> the<00:01:05.159> sides<00:01:05.400> because<00:01:05.700> that<00:01:06.420> allows<00:01:07.049> my

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 
sprayed the sides because that allows my

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.310 
sprayed the sides because that allows my
sponge<00:01:07.770> cake<00:01:08.040> to<00:01:08.220> rise<00:01:08.430> and<00:01:08.790> remain<00:01:09.320> risen

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:48.430 
rustic naked cake is very clean for this
in<00:03:46.669> here<00:03:46.879> I<00:03:46.910> made<00:03:47.180> sure<00:03:47.329> that<00:03:47.510> it's<00:03:47.660> messy<00:03:48.230> I

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:48.440 
in here I made sure that it's messy I

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:50.589 
in here I made sure that it's messy I
wasn't<00:03:49.220> too<00:03:49.310> satisfied<00:03:49.549> with<00:03:49.940> that<00:03:50.060> so<00:03:50.269> I<00:03:50.329> kept

00:03:50.589 --> 00:03:50.599 
wasn't too satisfied with that so I kept

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:52.270 
wasn't too satisfied with that so I kept
going<00:03:50.900> around<00:03:51.019> the<00:03:51.230> cake<00:03:51.440> and<00:03:51.739> eventually<00:03:52.250> I

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
going around the cake and eventually I

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.520 
going around the cake and eventually I
gave<00:03:52.549> pretty<00:03:53.060> much<00:03:53.209> the<00:03:53.389> whole<00:03:53.510> cake<00:03:53.840> in<00:03:54.109> a

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:54.530 
gave pretty much the whole cake in a

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:56.259 
gave pretty much the whole cake in a
very<00:03:54.829> fine<00:03:55.190> layer<00:03:55.400> of<00:03:55.639> buttercream<00:03:55.970> but<00:03:56.239> I

00:03:56.259 --> 00:03:56.269 
very fine layer of buttercream but I

00:03:56.269 --> 00:03:57.599 
very fine layer of buttercream but I
wanted<00:03:56.510> to<00:03:56.599> make<00:03:56.750> sure<00:03:56.780> that<00:03:56.959> you<00:03:57.169> could<00:03:57.319> see

00:03:57.599 --> 00:03:57.609 
wanted to make sure that you could see

00:03:57.609 --> 00:04:00.839 
wanted to make sure that you could see
where<00:03:58.609> the<00:03:58.879> cake<00:03:59.449> layers<00:03:59.810> started<00:04:00.560> and<00:04:00.680> ended

00:04:00.839 --> 00:04:00.849 
where the cake layers started and ended

00:04:00.849 --> 00:04:03.189 
where the cake layers started and ended
so<00:04:01.849> you<00:04:01.940> can<00:04:02.060> see<00:04:02.209> just<00:04:02.389> how<00:04:02.510> thin<00:04:02.870> that<00:04:02.900> layer

00:04:03.189 --> 00:04:03.199 
so you can see just how thin that layer

00:04:03.199 --> 00:04:05.439 
so you can see just how thin that layer
is<00:04:03.440> and<00:04:03.799> I<00:04:04.250> did<00:04:04.400> leave<00:04:04.609> some<00:04:04.909> areas<00:04:05.239> completely

00:04:05.439 --> 00:04:05.449
