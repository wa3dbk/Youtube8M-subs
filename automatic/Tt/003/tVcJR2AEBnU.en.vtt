these<00:00:16.090> are<00:00:16.270> very<00:00:16.660> fragile<00:00:17.080> so<00:00:17.560> be<00:00:17.710> very

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:17.830 
these are very fragile so be very

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:18.570 
these are very fragile so be very
careful

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:18.580 
careful

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:33.520 
careful
take<00:00:19.540> your<00:00:19.690> time<00:00:19.840> making<00:00:20.170> your<00:00:20.380> folds

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:33.530 

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:37.869 

then<00:00:34.160> fold<00:00:34.640> it<00:00:34.879> a<00:00:34.910> little<00:00:36.670> crimp<00:00:37.670> those

00:00:37.869 --> 00:00:37.879 
then fold it a little crimp those

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:55.650 
then fold it a little crimp those
corners

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:55.660 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:59.430 

that<00:00:56.590> my<00:00:56.800> friends<00:00:57.280> is<00:00:57.400> how<00:00:57.430> you<00:00:57.640> make<00:00:57.970> a<00:00:58.440> paper

00:00:59.430 --> 00:00:59.440 
that my friends is how you make a paper

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:09.020 
that my friends is how you make a paper
propeller<00:01:00.330> let's<00:01:01.330> see<00:01:01.540> if<00:01:01.630> it<00:01:01.750> flies

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:09.030 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:15.090 

perfection<00:01:12.030> the<00:01:13.030> world<00:01:13.210> record<00:01:13.540> for<00:01:13.570> this<00:01:14.100> is

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.100 
perfection the world record for this is

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.820 
perfection the world record for this is
three<00:01:15.460> and<00:01:15.490> a<00:01:15.610> half<00:01:15.729> minutes<00:01:16.500> then<00:01:17.500> you<00:01:17.619> pass

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:17.830 
three and a half minutes then you pass

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:23.130 
three and a half minutes then you pass
out<00:01:18.070> I<00:01:21.240> actually<00:01:22.240> I'm<00:01:22.479> going<00:01:22.600> to<00:01:22.660> pass<00:01:22.810> it<00:01:22.990> just

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:23.140 
out I actually I'm going to pass it just

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:29.639 
out I actually I'm going to pass it just
from<00:01:23.259> that<00:01:27.869> and<00:01:28.869> it's<00:01:29.050> very<00:01:29.259> important<00:01:29.619> that

00:01:29.639 --> 00:01:29.649 
from that and it's very important that

00:01:29.649 --> 00:01:31.499 
from that and it's very important that
you<00:01:29.800> take<00:01:30.009> your<00:01:30.070> time<00:01:30.430> while<00:01:31.240> you're<00:01:31.360> making

00:01:31.499 --> 00:01:31.509 
you take your time while you're making

00:01:31.509 --> 00:01:38.450 
you take your time while you're making
these<00:01:33.300> make<00:01:34.300> very<00:01:34.630> exact<00:01:35.140> folds

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.980 

be<00:01:39.460> very<00:01:39.670> gentle<00:01:39.759> whether<00:01:40.330> the<00:01:40.509> paper<00:01:40.720> is<00:01:40.960> very

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:40.990 
be very gentle whether the paper is very

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:45.779 
be very gentle whether the paper is very
fragile<00:01:43.830> and<00:01:44.830> they<00:01:44.950> can<00:01:45.100> handle<00:01:45.280> a<00:01:45.490> certain

00:01:45.779 --> 00:01:45.789 
fragile and they can handle a certain

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:54.700 
fragile and they can handle a certain
amount<00:01:45.940> of<00:01:46.030> abuse<00:01:46.330> wood

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:54.710 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.210 

is<00:01:55.310> gentle<00:01:56.000> as<00:01:56.120> it<00:01:56.270> as<00:01:56.390> possible<00:01:57.229> another

00:01:58.210 --> 00:01:58.220 
is gentle as it as possible another

00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:59.440 
is gentle as it as possible another
important<00:01:58.610> thing<00:01:58.729> to<00:01:58.820> remember<00:01:58.909> is<00:01:59.330> when

00:01:59.440 --> 00:01:59.450 
important thing to remember is when

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:00.640 
important thing to remember is when
you're<00:01:59.600> flying<00:01:59.810> the<00:01:59.930> propeller<00:02:00.260> make<00:02:00.470> sure

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:00.650 
you're flying the propeller make sure

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:03.310 
you're flying the propeller make sure
that<00:02:00.860> it's<00:02:01.729> facing<00:02:02.030> the<00:02:02.270> right<00:02:02.450> direction<00:02:02.479> if

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
that it's facing the right direction if

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:06.010 
that it's facing the right direction if
the<00:02:03.680> if<00:02:04.580> these<00:02:04.790> folds<00:02:05.270> are<00:02:05.330> not<00:02:05.479> facing

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
the if these folds are not facing

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.169 
the if these folds are not facing
outwards<00:02:06.409> it's<00:02:07.070> not<00:02:07.250> gonna<00:02:07.430> it's<00:02:07.909> not<00:02:08.030> gonna

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:08.179 
outwards it's not gonna it's not gonna

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:10.779 
outwards it's not gonna it's not gonna
work<00:02:08.390> properly<00:02:08.690> so<00:02:09.200> make<00:02:09.560> sure<00:02:10.399> you<00:02:10.550> crimp

00:02:10.779 --> 00:02:10.789 
work properly so make sure you crimp

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:19.960 
work properly so make sure you crimp
those<00:02:10.910> corners<00:02:11.770> it's<00:02:12.770> like<00:02:12.950> this<00:02:18.850> and<00:02:19.850> then

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:19.970 
those corners it's like this and then

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:21.309 
those corners it's like this and then
once<00:02:20.120> you've<00:02:20.270> got<00:02:20.450> to<00:02:20.540> turn<00:02:20.750> into<00:02:20.959> your<00:02:21.110> little

00:02:21.309 --> 00:02:21.319 
once you've got to turn into your little

00:02:21.319 --> 00:02:25.270 
once you've got to turn into your little
tray<00:02:22.300> it's<00:02:23.300> like<00:02:23.569> that<00:02:23.780> flying<00:02:24.650> it<00:02:24.830> out<00:02:24.950> just<00:02:25.130> a

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:25.280 
tray it's like that flying it out just a

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:34.509 
tray it's like that flying it out just a
little<00:02:26.709> let's<00:02:27.709> see<00:02:27.860> if<00:02:27.920> it<00:02:28.040> flies<00:02:33.340> there<00:02:34.340> you

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:34.519 
little let's see if it flies there you

00:02:34.519 --> 00:02:37.770 
little let's see if it flies there you
need<00:02:34.640> a<00:02:34.700> little<00:02:34.940> speed<00:02:35.269> to<00:02:35.570> make<00:02:35.870> them<00:02:36.019> fly

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
need a little speed to make them fly

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.009 
need a little speed to make them fly
yeah<00:02:38.780> that's<00:02:39.050> a<00:02:39.170> nice<00:02:39.440> propeller<00:02:40.010> right<00:02:40.250> there

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:41.019 
yeah that's a nice propeller right there

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:45.400 
yeah that's a nice propeller right there
now<00:02:42.019> it<00:02:42.200> works<00:02:42.470> just<00:02:42.830> fine
