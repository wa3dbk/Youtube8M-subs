00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:33.060 
is I probably say it's maybe a 10 to a

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:34.550 
is I probably say it's maybe a 10 to a
10<00:05:33.300> and<00:05:33.419> a<00:05:33.479> half<00:05:33.509> just<00:05:33.930> because<00:05:34.169> I've<00:05:34.289> owned<00:05:34.470> a

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:34.560 
10 and a half just because I've owned a

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:36.290
