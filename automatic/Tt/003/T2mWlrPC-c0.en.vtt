00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:11.580

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:15.839

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.380
 others take place outside 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:27.630
 and the parents also appreciate that 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.949
 daughter is four years old and like her 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:30.480
 in the forest kindergarten because I always have a lot 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.030
 action needs him on the move 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.770
 outside in nature and when they are the same 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.750
 with those in the woods then go with the 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.540
 children when they see what i mean 

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:52.739
 For the start of the day, there is the first 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:55.739
 welcome song in the morning something very 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:01:00.440
 important is the attendance list and 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.440
 which is also checked off musically 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:16.590
 the children show us theirs today 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:19.170
 favorite places the kletterberg live in 

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.340
 the nature intensive care and a lot 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.189
 lived practice 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.090
 That is the recipe for success of the 

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:26.790
 Waldkindergarten like the headmistress 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:28.799
 nadine niemeyer reveals the beautiful 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:30.540
 our forest kindergarten is tree frogs 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.700
 that we have 20 children and we three 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.650
 We are therefore able to care for you completely 

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.450
 individually to the children to take the 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.950
 means the kids are discovering here 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.659
 forest or even on the way to the forest 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.400
 an animal such as a 

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:42.840
 kellerassel and we can by means of 

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.520
 Determination books and look like that 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.280
 animal looks like it eats 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.390
 their habitat of animals and so succeed 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.890
 Just take us through the high 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.240
 mentoring key also on the children 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.130
 enter into 

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.899
 the beautiful is also that we wind 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.820
 and weather outside we are let us 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:58.500
 do not be deterred by rain 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.200
 that's how we do ours, for example 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.790
 preschool education in the forest creative 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.649
 Offers in the forest picture book 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:06.479
 Considerations then visit us beautiful 

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:07.920
 action under the canopy and such 

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:09.959
 Can we all then 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.880
 offers at the regular kindergarten in the 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.920
 We can do that in the forest in the house 

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.390
 implement nature and we are of it 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.450
 convinced that the children thus 

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:20.190
 then there is a foundation stone for life 

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:23.010
 It is high time for one 

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:25.550
 breakfast but before once hands 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:25.550
 to wash 

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.780
 Andrea Bache is an educator and explains 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.870
 the daily routine 

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:51.209
 We are sitting here at breakfast as well 

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.370
 every morning when it is not in 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:57.330
 streams rain or when it storms and 

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:59.580
 snowing and from here it goes the same 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.940
 continue to find our action in the forest 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:01.680
 instead of 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:05.610
 the children have the opportunity to 

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:09.620
 free games for roleplaying have time to play 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:14.370
 Discover to experience 

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:16.739
 until 12 o'clock at 12 o'clock we go back 

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:18.810
 to the hut where the children are picked up 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:20.570
 can be between 12 and half past twelve the 

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:23.910
 life in the forest is also the 

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:26.549
 improvisation if ever urgent 

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:30.060
 Big deals are the answer 

00:03:26.549 --> 00:03:32.609
 Nevertheless, hygiene is pragmatic 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.799
 important and unavoidable like nadine 

00:03:32.609 --> 00:03:36.780
 niemeyer further explains the 

00:03:34.799 --> 00:03:38.670
 Hygiene measures in the forest begin at 

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:40.799
 us that we are on the way to the forest 

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:44.040
 To be discovering a lot he is mushrooms 

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:45.600
 plants or different animals and to 

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.620
 We wash ourselves from that 

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:48.510
 breakfast hands 

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.280
 So we make sure that the hands 

00:03:48.510 --> 00:03:51.420
 the children have washed the breakfast 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.970
 may be touched 

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:56.010
 Another hygiene measures is 

00:03:53.970 --> 00:03:58.680
 for example, that we in the forest 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:00.030
 possibility also to get fit and 

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.290
 hands on too after business 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:01.739
 Wash with the water we have with you 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:04.290
 to lead 

00:04:01.739 --> 00:04:08.489
 the question remains what is so great 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:11.040

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:12.450

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:23.780

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:29.699
 that was that way here in front of the cafÃ© 

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:32.539

00:04:37.909 --> 00:04:43.440
 and the beautiful in this kindergarten 

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:45.419
 is that the carrier one 

00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:47.940
 Parent initiative is we are one 

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:49.560

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:55.110

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:04.139
 emphasize that here in the kindergarten parents 

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:06.240
 They are very committed 

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:08.669
 Help it be a driving service 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:10.650

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:22.430
