been working on a remake of my halo 4
map<00:00:13.590> drill<00:00:14.099> site<00:00:14.719> now<00:00:15.719> if<00:00:16.020> you're<00:00:16.199> not

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
map drill site now if you're not

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.370 
map drill site now if you're not
familiar<00:00:16.379> with<00:00:17.070> drill<00:00:17.279> site<00:00:17.690> this<00:00:18.690> was<00:00:18.900> like<00:00:19.199> I

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
familiar with drill site this was like I

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.370 
familiar with drill site this was like I
say<00:00:19.590> a<00:00:19.859> halo<00:00:20.580> 4<00:00:20.939> map<00:00:21.150> that<00:00:21.480> was<00:00:21.720> actually<00:00:22.080> in

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:22.380 
say a halo 4 map that was actually in

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.089 
say a halo 4 map that was actually in
the<00:00:22.470> flood<00:00:22.740> playlist<00:00:23.189> in<00:00:23.490> matchmaking<00:00:23.789> and

00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:25.099 
the flood playlist in matchmaking and

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:27.290 
the flood playlist in matchmaking and
now<00:00:26.099> I've<00:00:26.250> brought<00:00:26.519> it<00:00:26.699> to<00:00:26.820> halo<00:00:27.090> 2

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
now I've brought it to halo 2

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.410 
now I've brought it to halo 2
anniversary<00:00:28.340> so<00:00:29.340> I<00:00:29.369> guess<00:00:29.490> first<00:00:29.970> starters

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
anniversary so I guess first starters

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.479 
anniversary so I guess first starters
I'll<00:00:31.170> give<00:00:31.349> you<00:00:31.439> guys<00:00:31.590> a<00:00:31.619> short<00:00:32.040> description

I'll give you guys a short description

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.549 
I'll give you guys a short description
of<00:00:33.000> the<00:00:33.180> map<00:00:33.390> for<00:00:33.719> those<00:00:33.840> of<00:00:34.020> you<00:00:34.110> who<00:00:34.290> haven't

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
of the map for those of you who haven't

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.360 
of the map for those of you who haven't
played<00:00:34.829> on<00:00:35.160> it<00:00:36.200> drill<00:00:37.200> site<00:00:37.410> is<00:00:37.680> basically<00:00:38.340> a

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:38.370 
played on it drill site is basically a

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.150 
played on it drill site is basically a
free<00:00:38.579> roam<00:00:39.149> infection<00:00:40.079> map<00:00:40.260> that<00:00:40.649> takes<00:00:40.920> place

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
free roam infection map that takes place

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.479 
free roam infection map that takes place
on<00:00:41.579> a<00:00:41.610> drilling<00:00:42.149> platform<00:00:42.809> or<00:00:43.050> an<00:00:43.890> oil<00:00:44.250> rig

00:00:44.479 --> 00:00:44.489 
on a drilling platform or an oil rig

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:48.080 
on a drilling platform or an oil rig
whatever<00:00:45.480> you<00:00:45.570> want<00:00:45.629> to<00:00:45.750> call<00:00:45.930> it<00:00:45.989> and<00:00:47.090> there's

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:48.090 
whatever you want to call it and there's

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:50.930 
whatever you want to call it and there's
multiple<00:00:48.629> different<00:00:49.620> looking<00:00:50.160> holdouts

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940 
multiple different looking holdouts

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:54.799 
multiple different looking holdouts
throughout<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.629> map<00:00:51.840> that<00:00:52.170> kind<00:00:52.440> of<00:00:53.809> each

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
throughout the map that kind of each

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.369 
throughout the map that kind of each
lend<00:00:55.320> to<00:00:55.469> a<00:00:55.590> different<00:00:56.219> style<00:00:56.520> of<00:00:56.640> gameplay

00:00:57.369 --> 00:00:57.379 
lend to a different style of gameplay

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:00.200 
lend to a different style of gameplay
this<00:00:58.379> is<00:00:58.590> largely<00:00:58.949> due<00:00:59.070> to<00:00:59.309> the<00:00:59.820> fact<00:01:00.000> that

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
this is largely due to the fact that

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:03.349 
this is largely due to the fact that
there's<00:01:00.600> so<00:01:00.930> much<00:01:01.079> verticality<00:01:02.180> you<00:01:03.180> can

00:01:03.349 --> 00:01:03.359 
there's so much verticality you can

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:06.020 
there's so much verticality you can
really<00:01:03.570> separate<00:01:04.170> the<00:01:05.040> levels<00:01:05.430> and<00:01:05.670> give<00:01:05.909> them

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:06.030 
really separate the levels and give them

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:09.620 
really separate the levels and give them
a<00:01:06.150> different<00:01:06.330> purpose<00:01:06.869> or<00:01:07.470> theme<00:01:08.360> well<00:01:09.360> still

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
a different purpose or theme well still

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.480 
a different purpose or theme well still
kind<00:01:09.869> of<00:01:09.930> connecting<00:01:10.470> them<00:01:10.860> using<00:01:11.280> things

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
kind of connecting them using things

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.390 
kind of connecting them using things
like<00:01:11.580> lifts<00:01:12.119> and<00:01:12.330> ramps<00:01:13.040> so<00:01:14.040> it's<00:01:14.340> cool

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:14.400 
like lifts and ramps so it's cool

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.670 
like lifts and ramps so it's cool
because<00:01:14.760> you<00:01:15.119> you<00:01:15.600> could<00:01:15.810> be<00:01:15.930> holding<00:01:16.140> out<00:01:16.439> at

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
because you you could be holding out at

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.530 
because you you could be holding out at
the<00:01:16.860> bottom<00:01:17.220> of<00:01:17.340> the<00:01:17.460> map<00:01:17.640> and<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:18.119> infected

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
the bottom of the map and the infected

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.929 
the bottom of the map and the infected
will<00:01:18.689> be<00:01:18.960> spawning<00:01:19.560> at<00:01:19.710> the<00:01:19.830> top<00:01:20.009> or<00:01:20.250> you<00:01:20.310> could

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
will be spawning at the top or you could

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.450 
will be spawning at the top or you could
be<00:01:21.090> inside<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:21.689> warehouse<00:01:21.840> up<00:01:22.290> top<00:01:22.530> trying<00:01:23.340> to

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
be inside the warehouse up top trying to

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.550 
be inside the warehouse up top trying to
cover<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:23.909> various<00:01:24.299> routes<00:01:24.570> that<00:01:24.960> lead<00:01:25.530> to

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
cover the various routes that lead to

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:29.030 
cover the various routes that lead to
the<00:01:25.770> upper<00:01:26.130> platform<00:01:27.229> so<00:01:28.229> with<00:01:28.409> this<00:01:28.560> map<00:01:28.799> I

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
the upper platform so with this map I

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.789 
the upper platform so with this map I
really<00:01:29.369> wanted<00:01:29.610> to<00:01:29.820> capture<00:01:30.450> the<00:01:31.049> setting<00:01:31.590> of

00:01:31.789 --> 00:01:31.799 
really wanted to capture the setting of

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:33.740 
really wanted to capture the setting of
what<00:01:32.040> you<00:01:32.159> would<00:01:32.340> expect<00:01:32.700> to<00:01:32.939> find<00:01:33.180> on<00:01:33.479> an<00:01:33.630> oil

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
what you would expect to find on an oil

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.560 
what you would expect to find on an oil
rig<00:01:33.960> and<00:01:34.350> I<00:01:35.070> wanted<00:01:35.310> players<00:01:35.549> to<00:01:35.880> actually

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
rig and I wanted players to actually

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.130 
rig and I wanted players to actually
feel<00:01:36.930> like<00:01:37.290> they<00:01:37.799> are<00:01:37.950> on<00:01:37.979> an<00:01:38.340> oil<00:01:38.430> rig<00:01:38.640> and

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:39.140 
feel like they are on an oil rig and

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.569 
feel like they are on an oil rig and
make<00:01:40.140> it<00:01:40.290> so<00:01:40.470> that<00:01:40.680> when<00:01:40.799> you<00:01:40.950> look<00:01:41.159> at<00:01:41.310> the<00:01:41.430> map

00:01:41.569 --> 00:01:41.579 
make it so that when you look at the map

00:01:41.579 --> 00:01:44.990 
make it so that when you look at the map
as<00:01:41.820> a<00:01:41.880> whole<00:01:42.740> there's<00:01:43.740> nothing<00:01:43.890> hidden<00:01:44.280> you

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
as a whole there's nothing hidden you

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.700 
as a whole there's nothing hidden you
know<00:01:45.030> there's<00:01:45.299> nothing<00:01:45.420> sticking<00:01:45.990> out<00:01:46.350> that

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
know there's nothing sticking out that

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.920 
know there's nothing sticking out that
would<00:01:46.979> be<00:01:47.280> otherwise<00:01:48.000> hidden<00:01:48.420> from<00:01:48.750> the

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:48.930 
would be otherwise hidden from the

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.380 
would be otherwise hidden from the
player's<00:01:49.170> perspective<00:01:50.060> so<00:01:51.060> it<00:01:51.119> was<00:01:51.240> actually

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
player's perspective so it was actually

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.679 
player's perspective so it was actually
quite<00:01:51.750> the<00:01:51.960> challenge<00:01:53.299> because<00:01:54.299> unlike

00:01:54.679 --> 00:01:54.689 
quite the challenge because unlike

00:01:54.689 --> 00:01:56.569 
quite the challenge because unlike
forging<00:01:55.229> on<00:01:55.350> terrain<00:01:55.680> that's<00:01:56.040> already<00:01:56.219> flat

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
forging on terrain that's already flat

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:00.679 
forging on terrain that's already flat
or<00:01:56.850> even<00:01:57.479> as<00:01:57.630> hills<00:01:58.399> you<00:01:59.399> can't<00:02:00.090> just<00:02:00.180> merge

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
or even as hills you can't just merge

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.959 
or even as hills you can't just merge
pieces<00:02:01.290> into<00:02:01.740> the<00:02:01.860> geometry<00:02:02.460> without

00:02:02.959 --> 00:02:02.969 
pieces into the geometry without

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:05.179 
pieces into the geometry without
worrying<00:02:03.360> about<00:02:03.719> them<00:02:04.409> showing<00:02:04.680> through<00:02:05.070> on

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189 
worrying about them showing through on

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:08.029 
worrying about them showing through on
the<00:02:05.280> other<00:02:05.369> side<00:02:06.290> so<00:02:07.290> you<00:02:07.350> have<00:02:07.530> to<00:02:07.649> use<00:02:07.770> pieces

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
the other side so you have to use pieces

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.460 
the other side so you have to use pieces
that<00:02:08.429> serve<00:02:08.759> their<00:02:09.119> purpose<00:02:09.569> but<00:02:10.289> don't

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470 
that serve their purpose but don't

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.920 
that serve their purpose but don't
actually<00:02:10.709> have<00:02:11.099> any<00:02:11.250> extra<00:02:11.760> structure<00:02:12.090> that

actually have any extra structure that

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.850 
actually have any extra structure that
you<00:02:13.080> would<00:02:13.230> need<00:02:13.349> to<00:02:13.410> high

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
you would need to high

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.150 
you would need to high
inside<00:02:14.370> the<00:02:14.550> maps<00:02:14.790> geometry<00:02:15.680> so<00:02:16.680> that<00:02:17.010> was

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
inside the maps geometry so that was

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.180 
inside the maps geometry so that was
quite<00:02:17.310> the<00:02:17.430> challenge<00:02:18.440> now<00:02:19.440> the<00:02:19.500> next<00:02:19.830> thing<00:02:19.980> I

play<00:03:00.720> as<00:03:00.840> a<00:03:00.870> flood<00:03:01.310> because<00:03:02.310> you<00:03:02.520> just<00:03:02.700> didn't

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:03.030 
play as a flood because you just didn't

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:05.210

this problem in halo 2 anniversary was

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.740 
this problem in halo 2 anniversary was
knife<00:03:11.130> a<00:03:11.310> lot<00:03:11.580> of<00:03:11.730> those<00:03:11.850> spots<00:03:12.180> that<00:03:12.540> were

knife a lot of those spots that were
previously<00:03:13.260> overpowered<00:03:14.840> now<00:03:15.840> you<00:03:15.900> can<00:03:16.080> see

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:16.320 
previously overpowered now you can see

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:18.530 
previously overpowered now you can see
first<00:03:16.620> of<00:03:16.800> all<00:03:16.950> this<00:03:17.220> brand<00:03:17.610> new<00:03:17.760> route<00:03:18.150> which

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
first of all this brand new route which

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.199 
first of all this brand new route which
leads<00:03:18.870> up<00:03:19.140> to<00:03:19.170> kind<00:03:19.860> of<00:03:20.010> near<00:03:20.670> the<00:03:20.790> helipad

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:21.209 
leads up to kind of near the helipad

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:23.600 
leads up to kind of near the helipad
it's<00:03:22.140> not<00:03:22.320> so<00:03:22.500> much<00:03:22.560> that<00:03:22.739> I<00:03:22.950> wanted<00:03:23.280> to<00:03:23.370> add

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610 
it's not so much that I wanted to add

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:26.600 
it's not so much that I wanted to add
another<00:03:23.850> route<00:03:24.360> up<00:03:25.040> but<00:03:26.040> there<00:03:26.190> needed<00:03:26.489> to<00:03:26.519> be

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
another route up but there needed to be

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:28.789 
another route up but there needed to be
another<00:03:27.000> way<00:03:27.239> to<00:03:27.269> drop<00:03:27.930> down<00:03:28.260> to<00:03:28.500> the<00:03:28.590> lower

00:03:28.789 --> 00:03:28.799 
another way to drop down to the lower

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:31.640 
another way to drop down to the lower
level<00:03:29.250> where<00:03:30.000> people<00:03:30.420> were<00:03:30.780> going<00:03:31.049> on<00:03:31.320> some

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:31.650 
level where people were going on some

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:34.220 
level where people were going on some
pretty<00:03:31.920> crazy<00:03:32.130> sprees<00:03:32.670> and<00:03:32.910> I<00:03:33.810> thought<00:03:33.989> well

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:34.230 
pretty crazy sprees and I thought well

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.340 
pretty crazy sprees and I thought well
why<00:03:34.440> not<00:03:34.470> have<00:03:34.799> this<00:03:35.209> new<00:03:36.209> ramp<00:03:36.600> leading<00:03:36.900> to

00:03:37.340 --> 00:03:37.350 
why not have this new ramp leading to

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:39.949 
why not have this new ramp leading to
the<00:03:37.530> upper<00:03:37.830> level<00:03:38.100> that<00:03:38.700> infected<00:03:39.239> can<00:03:39.480> use<00:03:39.690> as

00:03:39.949 --> 00:03:39.959 
the upper level that infected can use as

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:42.530 
the upper level that infected can use as
more<00:03:40.260> of<00:03:40.350> a<00:03:40.500> sneaker<00:03:40.980> out<00:03:41.190> when<00:03:41.430> spawning<00:03:42.000> on

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:42.540 
more of a sneaker out when spawning on

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:46.160 
more of a sneaker out when spawning on
the<00:03:42.720> bottom<00:03:43.019> level<00:03:43.580> so<00:03:44.580> that<00:03:44.610> kind<00:03:44.970> of<00:03:45.170> that

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
the bottom level so that kind of that

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:47.750 
the bottom level so that kind of that
was<00:03:46.320> kind<00:03:46.500> of<00:03:46.560> a<00:03:46.650> bonus<00:03:47.070> having<00:03:47.280> that<00:03:47.610> new

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:47.760 
was kind of a bonus having that new

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.370 
was kind of a bonus having that new
route<00:03:48.000> considering<00:03:48.630> I<00:03:48.750> was<00:03:48.870> originally

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
route considering I was originally

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:51.320 
route considering I was originally
planning<00:03:49.650> on<00:03:49.950> just<00:03:50.190> having<00:03:50.340> a<00:03:50.580> drop<00:03:50.850> down<00:03:51.090> and

00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:51.330 
planning on just having a drop down and

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:54.680 
planning on just having a drop down and
then<00:03:52.230> I<00:03:52.260> also<00:03:52.500> added<00:03:52.799> some<00:03:53.209> Goldeneye<00:03:54.209> pillars

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:54.690 
then I also added some Goldeneye pillars

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:58.070 
then I also added some Goldeneye pillars

more<00:04:19.350> changes<00:04:19.859> I've<00:04:20.070> managed<00:04:20.489> to<00:04:20.579> trim<00:04:21.180> down

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:21.209 
more changes I've managed to trim down

the sight lines in the warehouse

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:25.890 
the sight lines in the warehouse
I've<00:04:23.830> also<00:04:24.040> added<00:04:24.430> some<00:04:24.639> explosives<00:04:25.540> in<00:04:25.750> there

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:25.900 
I've also added some explosives in there

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:27.719 
I've also added some explosives in there
to<00:04:26.080> kind<00:04:26.260> of<00:04:26.410> keep<00:04:26.710> the<00:04:26.860> humans<00:04:27.190> occupied

00:04:27.719 --> 00:04:27.729 
to kind of keep the humans occupied

00:04:27.729 --> 00:04:31.379 
to kind of keep the humans occupied
shooting<00:04:28.290> at<00:04:29.290> the<00:04:29.470> explosives<00:04:30.010> so<00:04:30.280> that<00:04:30.520> they

00:04:31.379 --> 00:04:31.389 
shooting at the explosives so that they

00:04:31.389 --> 00:04:34.860 
shooting at the explosives so that they
can<00:04:31.570> gain<00:04:31.810> some<00:04:31.840> breathing<00:04:32.800> room<00:04:33.449> but<00:04:34.449> but

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:34.870 
can gain some breathing room but but

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:37.200 
can gain some breathing room but but
they'd<00:04:35.050> have<00:04:35.260> to<00:04:35.530> earn<00:04:36.160> it<00:04:36.400> by<00:04:36.610> shooting<00:04:37.090> the

00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:37.210 
they'd have to earn it by shooting the

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:39.600 
they'd have to earn it by shooting the
explosives<00:04:37.750> you<00:04:38.650> can<00:04:38.770> also<00:04:38.919> of<00:04:39.160> course<00:04:39.190> use

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:39.610 
explosives you can also of course use

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:42.150 
explosives you can also of course use
those<00:04:39.940> explosives<00:04:40.690> against<00:04:41.350> the<00:04:41.470> infected<00:04:41.979> if

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:42.160 
those explosives against the infected if

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.000 
those explosives against the infected if
they<00:04:42.310> get<00:04:42.520> close<00:04:42.729> enough<00:04:43.020> so<00:04:44.020> the<00:04:44.590> third

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:45.010 
they get close enough so the third

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:47.760 
they get close enough so the third
change<00:04:45.340> i<00:04:45.669> made<00:04:45.930> should<00:04:46.930> completely<00:04:47.380> nerf

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:47.770 
change i made should completely nerf

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:55.060 
the doc is what I referred to it as was

00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:57.570 
the doc is what I referred to it as was
a<00:04:55.090> terrible<00:04:55.750> kind<00:04:56.080> of<00:04:56.199> back<00:04:56.979> to<00:04:57.250> the<00:04:57.340> railing

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:57.580 
a terrible kind of back to the railing

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:02.310 
a terrible kind of back to the railing
hold<00:04:58.120> out<00:04:58.300> spot<00:04:58.600> in<00:04:58.900> Halo<00:04:59.410> 4<00:05:00.090> so<00:05:01.090> I<00:05:01.479> went<00:05:02.169> ahead

00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:02.320 
hold out spot in Halo 4 so I went ahead

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:05.100 
hold out spot in Halo 4 so I went ahead
and<00:05:02.470> ripped<00:05:02.949> off<00:05:03.160> the<00:05:03.430> back<00:05:03.669> railing<00:05:04.000> the<00:05:04.840> idea

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:05.110 
and ripped off the back railing the idea

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:07.529 
and ripped off the back railing the idea
is<00:05:05.169> that<00:05:05.320> a<00:05:05.560> ship<00:05:05.889> has<00:05:06.100> hit<00:05:06.370> it<00:05:06.520> and<00:05:06.639> all<00:05:07.270> the

00:05:07.529 --> 00:05:07.539 
is that a ship has hit it and all the

00:05:07.539 --> 00:05:09.890 
is that a ship has hit it and all the
debris<00:05:07.780> is<00:05:07.990> kind<00:05:08.320> of<00:05:08.440> just<00:05:08.470> floating<00:05:09.070> there

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:09.900 
debris is kind of just floating there

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:13.560 
debris is kind of just floating there
the<00:05:10.900> fourth<00:05:11.169> change<00:05:11.699> was<00:05:12.699> adding<00:05:13.030> infected

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:13.570 
the fourth change was adding infected

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:15.300 
the fourth change was adding infected
respawns<00:05:14.050> on<00:05:14.260> the<00:05:14.380> roof<00:05:14.620> of<00:05:14.830> the<00:05:14.949> warehouse

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:15.310 
respawns on the roof of the warehouse

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:17.670 
respawns on the roof of the warehouse
and<00:05:15.550> this<00:05:16.419> is<00:05:16.570> really<00:05:16.780> going<00:05:17.050> to<00:05:17.169> give<00:05:17.470> the

00:05:17.670 --> 00:05:17.680 
and this is really going to give the

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:20.520 
and this is really going to give the
infected<00:05:18.280> the<00:05:18.430> edge<00:05:18.580> they<00:05:19.030> need<00:05:19.380> seeing<00:05:20.380> as

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:20.530 
infected the edge they need seeing as

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:21.930 
infected the edge they need seeing as
they're<00:05:20.770> more<00:05:21.070> limited<00:05:21.520> for<00:05:21.729> movement

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:21.940 
they're more limited for movement

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:25.050 
they're more limited for movement
options<00:05:22.949> you<00:05:23.949> know<00:05:24.070> with<00:05:24.220> no<00:05:24.400> sprint<00:05:24.789> or<00:05:25.030> a

options you know with no sprint or a

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:27.420 
options you know with no sprint or a
thruster<00:05:25.630> pack<00:05:25.889> this<00:05:26.889> change<00:05:27.190> actually

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:27.430 
thruster pack this change actually

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:31.140 
thruster pack this change actually
helped<00:05:28.530> nerf<00:05:29.530> the<00:05:29.800> doc<00:05:30.220> even<00:05:30.729> more<00:05:30.970> because

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:31.150 
helped nerf the doc even more because

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:34.350 
helped nerf the doc even more because
now<00:05:32.110> the<00:05:32.169> infected<00:05:32.710> are<00:05:32.800> able<00:05:33.099> to<00:05:33.360> really

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:34.360 
now the infected are able to really

00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:36.240 
now the infected are able to really
tower<00:05:34.599> over<00:05:35.050> the<00:05:35.200> survivors<00:05:35.919> when<00:05:36.099> they're

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:36.250 
tower over the survivors when they're

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:39.330 
tower over the survivors when they're
trying<00:05:36.400> to<00:05:36.550> hold<00:05:36.729> out<00:05:36.940> there<00:05:37.180> and<00:05:37.830> the<00:05:38.830> fifth

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:39.340 
trying to hold out there and the fifth

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:41.969 
trying to hold out there and the fifth
and<00:05:39.610> final<00:05:39.639> thing<00:05:40.570> I<00:05:40.690> wanted<00:05:40.990> to<00:05:41.200> change<00:05:41.740> on

00:05:41.969 --> 00:05:41.979 
and final thing I wanted to change on

00:05:41.979 --> 00:05:44.879 
and final thing I wanted to change on
drill<00:05:42.220> site<00:05:42.460> was<00:05:43.050> to<00:05:44.050> make<00:05:44.229> the<00:05:44.410> weapons<00:05:44.770> a

00:05:44.879 --> 00:05:44.889 
drill site was to make the weapons a

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:46.920 
drill site was to make the weapons a
little<00:05:45.099> harder<00:05:45.400> to<00:05:45.520> find<00:05:45.760> so<00:05:46.120> as<00:05:46.330> you<00:05:46.720> walk

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:46.930 
little harder to find so as you walk

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:49.500 
little harder to find so as you walk
around<00:05:47.050> the<00:05:47.260> map<00:05:47.440> you'll<00:05:47.770> have<00:05:48.039> to<00:05:48.479> have<00:05:49.479> a

00:05:49.500 --> 00:05:49.510 
around the map you'll have to have a

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:51.570 
around the map you'll have to have a
little<00:05:49.750> more<00:05:49.960> awareness<00:05:50.349> in<00:05:50.860> Scouting<00:05:51.460> of

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:51.580 
little more awareness in Scouting of

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:56.460 
little more awareness in Scouting of
weapons<00:05:53.190> but<00:05:54.190> that's<00:05:54.880> about<00:05:55.150> it<00:05:55.210> if<00:05:56.080> you<00:05:56.289> guys

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:56.470 
weapons but that's about it if you guys

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:58.050 
weapons but that's about it if you guys
have<00:05:56.680> any<00:05:56.800> other<00:05:57.010> suggestions<00:05:57.520> for<00:05:57.849> changes
