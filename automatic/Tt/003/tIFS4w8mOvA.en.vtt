00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.920 
fabricated um we're going to pull the

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:09.590 
fabricated um we're going to pull the
engine<00:01:08.130> back<00:01:08.340> out<00:01:08.549> and<00:01:08.700> turn<00:01:08.880> it<00:01:09.030> into<00:01:09.119> a<00:01:09.210> 383

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:09.600 
engine back out and turn it into a 383

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.840 
engine back out and turn it into a 383
stroker<00:01:09.810> with<00:01:10.500> the<00:01:10.650> hot<00:01:10.860> cam<00:01:11.159> in<00:01:11.340> it<00:01:11.460> so<00:01:11.670> it'll

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
stroker with the hot cam in it so it'll

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.510 
stroker with the hot cam in it so it'll
probably<00:01:11.880> be<00:01:12.240> around<00:01:12.360> like<00:01:13.290> 450<00:01:14.189> horsepower

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
probably be around like 450 horsepower
