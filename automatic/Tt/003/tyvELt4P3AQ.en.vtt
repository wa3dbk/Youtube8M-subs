00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:07.859
 hi friends from youtube good let's see 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:12.420
 in this case how are we going to recover a 

00:00:07.859 --> 00:00:14.940
 disc let's go in here to administer 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:18.300
 and we see that we have managed 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:21.750
 disk devices and we have here 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.520
 a gpt protective partition so that 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.670
 it would not let us format I'm in a 

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:30.750
 format ntfs of a 32 then how are we going 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:33.210
 to recover this good we see that here the 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:36.559
 unit does not have like the others does not have 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.559
 one letter assigned 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:42.680
 and it does not give us options to do anything with 

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.780
 this partition then let's take it 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:48.620
 this from ppt 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:51.120
 and be able to format it in the tps of a 32 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:54.809
 well, what do we have to do? 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:01:01.440
 we run let's go here start run 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:01.440
 we already directly control dix park 

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:11.150
 we accept and we already get mixed 

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:14.640
 now here we put lists to know 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:17.460
 luis dis 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.950
 and so we know the discs that we have 

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:23.190
 good the unit that we want 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.350
 prepare is this 7 47 gigas 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:28.890
 you have to be very sure that 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:31.170
 disk is in my case it's disk 2 because 

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:33.390
 if you can not screw up any other 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.130
 partition you have on another disk other 

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.050
 any disk then you have to 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.980
 be very safe and that is seen there in 

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:41.610
 disk manager 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:44.330
 Well now we select that with 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:47.159
 select 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:51.420
 we can be the dix 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:56.070
 and the disk that is in my case is 2 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:58.500
 ok then let's enter 

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:01.729
 and now he tells us that disc 2 is now 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:04.680
 the selected disc is worth then 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:05.850
 now to erase it do an erasure 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.380
 full 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.380
 we play 

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:14.530
 to do an erasure if we want to do 

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:16.930
 a complete deletion to eliminate 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:22.090
 partitions on that disk delete all 

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:24.160
 we play to erase all whether 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.050
 we have a partition as if we have 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:31.410
 data like we have everything in there 

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:31.410
 we erase everything then we give to enter 

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:39.340
 and the entire disk is not being erased 

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:39.340
 It will take a ratillo 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:47.510
 I'm fine it can be done on a disk 

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:51.630
 external or by usb as well connected to the 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:54.890
 video port serial ATA port 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:54.890
 from a tc tower 

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.660
 we are still waiting we carry a ratillo 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.680
 although I'm going to cut the waiting time 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:10.230
 in the video takes quite a while 

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:12.690
 that if you do not have any partitions in 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:15.080
 that disk and the disk and it's formatted and 

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:20.080
 everything therefore the best thing is that you put or what 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:22.990
 read cleaning the new channel of everything 

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:24.660
 because that way it will last you far less 

00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:28.220
 weather 

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:28.220
 we are still waiting 

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:33.980
 and once finished we can see that it puts 

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.000
 dispar has cleaned the disc 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:38.160
 satisfactorily I say that this 

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.380
 take his 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.300
 so now we leave here with the 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:47.510
 sit 

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:50.430
 in yep we go to my pc 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:54.299
 and administered 

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:57.390
 we give you record management we go 

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:58.890
 to see a tutorial we follow it next 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:00.930
 the disc is not found we do not go to the 

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:04.730
 following 

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:04.730
 15 and now finalize 

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:15.150
 and now we have disk 2 and it puts us 

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:17.940
 not without nothing then the new partition 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:21.000
 the next match in primary or 

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:24.389
 extended as you want next 

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:26.340
 we choose the entire partition 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:30.020
 or we make it a partition with less 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:32.319
 megas next 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:35.419
 if not sound if you want next 

00:04:32.319 --> 00:04:37.260
 ntfs we put volume name if 

00:04:35.419 --> 00:04:40.290
 we want 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:45.120
 and we do not give you to format fast what 

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:49.650
 we leave next finalize and ready now 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:53.760
 we have the disc prepared and without that 

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:56.689
 it put us on gpt protective partition and 

00:04:53.760 --> 00:05:00.409
 It's there I hope you liked it 

00:04:56.689 --> 00:05:04.179
 tutorial now we call here my pc and 

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:04.179
 we have it here assigned 

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:14.470
 I hope you liked the little finger up 

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:16.950
 subscribe and a good friends until
