00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
several times during the summer and I've

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.039 
several times during the summer and I've
probably<00:01:41.250> cut<00:01:41.700> out<00:01:41.909> just<00:01:42.210> as<00:01:42.329> many<00:01:42.540> branches

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:43.049 
probably cut out just as many branches

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.609 
probably cut out just as many branches
as<00:01:43.350> what<00:01:43.860> you<00:01:43.979> see<00:01:44.220> there<00:01:44.630> they're<00:01:45.630> extremely

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:55.069 
sick and extremely bushy but they've
produced<00:01:50.490> well<00:01:50.850> and<00:01:52.460> with<00:01:53.460> all<00:01:53.790> of<00:01:54.000> our<00:01:54.180> rain

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
produced well and with all of our rain

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.340 
produced well and with all of our rain
and<00:01:55.590> all<00:01:55.950> of<00:01:56.070> the<00:01:56.189> humidity<00:01:56.810> they've<00:01:57.810> stood<00:01:58.200> up

to<00:01:58.530> disease<00:01:58.920> relatively<00:01:59.820> well<00:02:00.060> I<00:02:00.090> mean

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
to disease relatively well I mean

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.789 
to disease relatively well I mean
they're<00:02:01.020> diseased<00:02:01.530> now<00:02:01.950> but<00:02:03.259> I'm<00:02:04.259> amazed<00:02:04.680> that

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
they're diseased now but I'm amazed that

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:08.630 
they're diseased now but I'm amazed that
they<00:02:04.979> survived<00:02:05.369> at<00:02:05.549> all<00:02:07.099> according<00:02:08.099> to<00:02:08.310> the

they survived at all according to the
seed<00:02:08.910> packet<00:02:09.450> the

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:10.210 
seed packet the

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:12.090 
seed packet the

many that fit that description those
ones<00:02:18.760> kind<00:02:19.000> of<00:02:19.150> close<00:02:19.420> but<00:02:19.890> for<00:02:20.890> the<00:02:20.980> most<00:02:21.160> part

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:21.490 
ones kind of close but for the most part

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:26.280 
ones kind of close but for the most part
the<00:02:22.480> tomatoes<00:02:23.020> were<00:02:24.120> just<00:02:25.120> like<00:02:25.360> the<00:02:25.840> San

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
the tomatoes were just like the San

marzanos<00:02:27.100> I<00:02:27.340> can't<00:02:27.640> tell<00:02:27.970> a<00:02:28.300> big<00:02:28.810> difference

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:28.840 
marzanos I can't tell a big difference

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:34.710 
marzanos I can't tell a big difference
between<00:02:29.410> the<00:02:29.860> two<00:02:32.520> here's<00:02:33.520> a<00:02:33.640> comparison<00:02:34.150> of

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
between the two here's a comparison of

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.170 
between the two here's a comparison of
the<00:02:35.050> San<00:02:35.320> Marzano<00:02:35.530> to<00:02:36.100> the<00:02:36.220> super<00:02:36.610> Italian

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180 
the San Marzano to the super Italian

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.270 
the San Marzano to the super Italian
that<00:02:37.390> cities<00:02:37.690> those<00:02:37.900> average-sized<00:02:38.650> ones<00:02:39.070> out

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
that cities those average-sized ones out

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:41.910 
that cities those average-sized ones out
here<00:02:39.310> the<00:02:40.060> one<00:02:40.240> on<00:02:40.390> the<00:02:40.480> left<00:02:40.720> is<00:02:40.960> San<00:02:41.230> Marzano

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:41.920 
here the one on the left is San Marzano

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:44.040 
here the one on the left is San Marzano
the<00:02:42.160> one<00:02:42.310> on<00:02:42.430> the<00:02:42.490> right<00:02:42.700> is<00:02:43.060> super<00:02:43.480> Italian

the one on the right is super Italian

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:46.650 
the one on the right is super Italian
and<00:02:44.440> the<00:02:45.010> big<00:02:45.160> difference<00:02:45.340> can<00:02:45.850> be<00:02:45.880> seen<00:02:46.240> when

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
and the big difference can be seen when

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.020 
and the big difference can be seen when
you<00:02:46.780> look<00:02:46.930> at<00:02:47.020> them<00:02:47.170> from<00:02:47.620> the<00:02:47.710> side<00:02:48.030> to

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.030 
you look at them from the side to

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:53.460 
you look at them from the side to
Sandler's<00:02:49.540> and<00:02:49.870> I<00:02:49.990> was<00:02:50.140> more<00:02:50.380> flat<00:02:50.860> and<00:02:52.470> super

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:53.470

Italians<00:02:54.040> are<00:02:54.720> thicker<00:02:57.060> but<00:02:58.060> other<00:02:58.270> than<00:02:58.540> that

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
Italians are thicker but other than that

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:00.840 
Italians are thicker but other than that
I<00:02:58.810> don't<00:02:59.080> see<00:02:59.290> a<00:02:59.500> big<00:02:59.710> difference<00:02:59.770> between<00:03:00.370> the

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:00.850 
I don't see a big difference between the

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:05.220 
I don't see a big difference between the
tomatoes<00:03:03.060> here's<00:03:04.060> another<00:03:04.450> one<00:03:04.780> of<00:03:04.990> the

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:05.230 
tomatoes here's another one of the

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.890 
tomatoes here's another one of the
plants<00:03:05.770> that<00:03:05.830> I<00:03:06.280> haven't<00:03:06.490> trimmed<00:03:06.940> up<00:03:07.300> yet<00:03:07.630> and

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:07.900 
plants that I haven't trimmed up yet and

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.170 
plants that I haven't trimmed up yet and
you<00:03:07.990> can<00:03:08.140> see<00:03:08.380> just<00:03:08.590> how<00:03:08.710> thick<00:03:09.250> they<00:03:09.550> get<00:03:09.850> I

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
you can see just how thick they get I

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.660 
you can see just how thick they get I
mean<00:03:10.720> it's<00:03:11.050> just<00:03:11.230> a<00:03:11.470> mass<00:03:11.710> of<00:03:12.010> branches<00:03:12.640> and

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670 
mean it's just a mass of branches and

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:16.440 
mean it's just a mass of branches and
leaves<00:03:13.000> in<00:03:13.420> there<00:03:13.690> but<00:03:14.530> they<00:03:15.160> produced<00:03:16.030> very

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 
leaves in there but they produced very

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.410 
leaves in there but they produced very
well<00:03:16.770> in<00:03:17.770> spite<00:03:18.190> of<00:03:18.490> it<00:03:18.640> and<00:03:18.820> they've<00:03:18.940> stood<00:03:19.240> up

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420 
well in spite of it and they've stood up

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.270 
well in spite of it and they've stood up
to<00:03:19.570> the<00:03:19.690> disease<00:03:20.050> very<00:03:20.440> well<00:03:20.710> with<00:03:20.980> the<00:03:21.040> sight

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
to the disease very well with the sight

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:27.990 
to the disease very well with the sight
of<00:03:21.520> it<00:03:21.990> so<00:03:23.760> I'm<00:03:24.760> rather<00:03:25.360> impressed<00:03:25.630> with<00:03:27.000> these

00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:28.000 
of it so I'm rather impressed with these

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.930 
of it so I'm rather impressed with these
Tomatoes<00:03:28.720> and<00:03:29.020> I'll<00:03:29.560> definitely<00:03:29.920> plant<00:03:30.730> them

00:03:30.930 --> 00:03:30.940 
Tomatoes and I'll definitely plant them

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.380 
Tomatoes and I'll definitely plant them
again<00:03:31.320> in<00:03:32.320> the<00:03:32.380> future

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:33.390 
again in the future

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:36.900 
again in the future
so<00:03:34.390> that's<00:03:34.720> how<00:03:34.990> the<00:03:35.050> super<00:03:35.800> Italians<00:03:36.430> turned

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:36.910 
so that's how the super Italians turned

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:40.530 
so that's how the super Italians turned
out<00:03:37.180> I<00:03:37.570> hope<00:03:37.960> it<00:03:38.170> helps
