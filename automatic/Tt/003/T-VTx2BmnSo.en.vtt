I can tell from these two figures that
were<00:02:19.430> actually<00:02:19.760> getting<00:02:20.000> does<00:02:20.780> this<00:02:21.050> one

00:02:21.369 --> 00:02:21.379 
were actually getting does this one

were actually getting does this one
slight<00:02:21.680> minor<00:02:22.099> pain<00:02:22.459> application

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:22.970 
slight minor pain application

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:24.880 
slight minor pain application
differences<00:02:23.420> uh<00:02:23.450> as<00:02:23.780> you<00:02:23.959> can<00:02:23.989> see<00:02:24.140> on<00:02:24.470> below

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:24.890 
differences uh as you can see on below

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.650 
differences uh as you can see on below
the<00:02:24.920> kneecap<00:02:25.250> there<00:02:25.640> the<00:02:25.910> silver<00:02:26.209> goes<00:02:26.420> right

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:26.660 
the kneecap there the silver goes right

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.610 
the kneecap there the silver goes right
below<00:02:26.930> there<00:02:27.200> and<00:02:27.610> on<00:02:28.610> the<00:02:28.819> newer<00:02:28.970> version<00:02:29.620> it

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:30.620 
below there and on the newer version it

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:32.229 
below there and on the newer version it
goes<00:02:30.799> above<00:02:31.160> the<00:02:31.310> kneecap<00:02:31.459> and<00:02:31.879> that's<00:02:32.000> pretty

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:32.239 
goes above the kneecap and that's pretty

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:33.640 
goes above the kneecap and that's pretty
much<00:02:32.330> the<00:02:32.540> only<00:02:32.660> thing<00:02:32.810> that<00:02:33.110> I<00:02:33.319> could<00:02:33.500> tell

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
much the only thing that I could tell

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.050 
much the only thing that I could tell
it's<00:02:33.860> really<00:02:34.099> different<00:02:34.370> about<00:02:34.580> these<00:02:34.849> guys

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:35.060 
it's really different about these guys

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:38.500 
it's really different about these guys
the<00:02:35.599> gold<00:02:36.319> is<00:02:36.620> pretty<00:02:37.519> much<00:02:37.730> exactly<00:02:38.000> the<00:02:38.390> same

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:38.510 
the gold is pretty much exactly the same

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.940 
the gold is pretty much exactly the same
so<00:02:39.080> other<00:02:39.799> than<00:02:39.980> that<00:02:40.690> very<00:02:41.690> very<00:02:42.170> minor<00:02:42.500> paint

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:42.950 
so other than that very very minor paint

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.430 
so other than that very very minor paint
application<00:02:43.610> difference<00:02:44.000> so<00:02:44.180> again<00:02:44.989> so<00:02:45.349> if

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:45.440 
application difference so again so if

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:46.990 
application difference so again so if
you<00:02:45.530> don't<00:02:45.709> want<00:02:45.829> to<00:02:45.890> pay<00:02:46.040> that<00:02:46.069> super<00:02:46.579> price

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:47.000 
you don't want to pay that super price

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.420 
you don't want to pay that super price

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
on secondary market a great chance to

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:50.860 
on secondary market a great chance to
add<00:02:49.610> the<00:02:49.790> sky<00:02:50.000> cherry<00:02:50.239> collection<00:02:50.660> because

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:54.980 
exact figure and a great figure it is

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.850 
exact figure and a great figure it is

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590 
nice as you can see and again he just

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:02.140 
nice as you can see and again he just
comes<00:03:00.769> from<00:03:00.890> very<00:03:01.129> unique<00:03:01.370> features<00:03:01.730> was<00:03:01.910> very

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:02.150 
comes from very unique features was very

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:05.770 
comes from very unique features was very
cool<00:03:03.250> the<00:03:04.250> other<00:03:04.430> thing<00:03:04.610> that<00:03:04.940> I<00:03:05.390> can<00:03:05.569> find

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:05.780 
cool the other thing that I can find

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:07.030 
cool the other thing that I can find
fault<00:03:06.049> with<00:03:06.140> this<00:03:06.319> guy's<00:03:06.530> probably<00:03:06.799> is<00:03:06.950> the

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
fault with this guy's probably is the

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:08.650 
fault with this guy's probably is the
gold<00:03:07.250> is<00:03:07.340> a<00:03:07.400> little<00:03:07.640> more<00:03:07.910> subdued<00:03:08.209> and<00:03:08.569> I

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:08.660 
gold is a little more subdued and I

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:10.240 
gold is a little more subdued and I
would<00:03:08.810> like<00:03:08.959> it<00:03:09.110> to<00:03:09.140> be<00:03:09.260> but<00:03:09.590> still<00:03:10.099> looks

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.250 
would like it to be but still looks

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:15.690 
would like it to be but still looks
pretty<00:03:10.459> nice<00:03:10.549> and<00:03:13.510> again<00:03:14.510> you<00:03:14.629> do<00:03:14.750> have<00:03:14.930> the

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
pretty nice and again you do have the

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:18.009 
pretty nice and again you do have the
silver<00:03:16.700> above<00:03:16.970> the<00:03:17.090> kneecap<00:03:17.239> and<00:03:17.450> I<00:03:17.660> really

00:03:18.009 --> 00:03:18.019 
silver above the kneecap and I really

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:19.750 
silver above the kneecap and I really
can't<00:03:18.260> remember<00:03:18.769> if<00:03:19.040> you're<00:03:19.160> like<00:03:19.310> me<00:03:19.489> which

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
can't remember if you're like me which

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.210 
can't remember if you're like me which
is<00:03:19.790> more<00:03:20.510> accurate<00:03:21.019> to<00:03:21.470> the<00:03:21.500> movie<00:03:21.590> is<00:03:21.889> it<00:03:22.040> if

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.220 
is more accurate to the movie is it if

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:25.750 
is more accurate to the movie is it if
it's<00:03:22.370> lower<00:03:22.900> under<00:03:23.900> so<00:03:24.190> you<00:03:25.190> know<00:03:25.280> I<00:03:25.430> guess<00:03:25.639> I

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760 
it's lower under so you know I guess I

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.039 
it's lower under so you know I guess I
should<00:03:25.910> do<00:03:26.000> a<00:03:26.030> little<00:03:26.180> more<00:03:26.269> research<00:03:26.510> on<00:03:26.930> the

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:27.049 
should do a little more research on the

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:30.600 
should do a little more research on the
Hat

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:30.610 

00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:33.060
