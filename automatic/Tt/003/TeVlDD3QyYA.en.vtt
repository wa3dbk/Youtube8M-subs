00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:31.880 

shut<00:02:28.980> in<00:02:29.160> there<00:02:30.050> there's<00:02:31.050> the<00:02:31.140> pin<00:02:31.470> it<00:02:31.650> doesn't

actually<00:02:32.010> lock<00:02:32.490> it<00:02:32.760> just<00:02:36.200> holds<00:02:37.200> I<00:02:37.290> guess<00:02:37.580> the

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
actually lock it just holds I guess the

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:40.070 
actually lock it just holds I guess the
only<00:02:38.670> thing<00:02:38.790> I<00:02:39.000> could<00:02:39.060> see<00:02:39.300> maybe<00:02:39.600> being<00:02:39.930> a

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
only thing I could see maybe being a

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:48.590 
only thing I could see maybe being a
problem<00:02:40.380> later<00:02:40.470> on<00:02:40.620> down<00:02:40.800> the<00:02:40.860> line<00:02:47.510> that<00:02:48.510> was

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
problem later on down the line that was

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:49.820 
problem later on down the line that was
kind<00:02:48.750> of<00:02:48.780> hard<00:02:48.960> to<00:02:48.990> get<00:02:49.110> out<00:02:49.230> of<00:02:49.290> there<00:02:49.380> these

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
kind of hard to get out of there these

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.880 
kind of hard to get out of there these
uh<00:02:50.270> rubber<00:02:51.270> little<00:02:51.630> fittings<00:02:51.960> here<00:02:52.050> I<00:02:52.380> think

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
uh rubber little fittings here I think

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:55.250 
uh rubber little fittings here I think
that's<00:02:53.040> what<00:02:53.190> holds<00:02:53.340> it<00:02:53.490> in<00:02:53.640> there<00:02:53.850> and<00:02:54.260> I

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
that's what holds it in there and I

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.010 
that's what holds it in there and I
think<00:02:55.530> that<00:02:55.800> that's<00:02:55.830> what<00:02:56.160> holds<00:02:56.310> the<00:02:57.020> plastic

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020 
think that that's what holds the plastic

00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:01.160 
think that that's what holds the plastic
in<00:02:58.140> there<00:02:59.240> not<00:03:00.240> to<00:03:00.390> pick<00:03:00.630> me<00:03:00.750> up<00:03:00.840> some<00:03:01.020> of<00:03:01.080> these

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:01.170 
in there not to pick me up some of these

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:09.850 
in there not to pick me up some of these
ahead<00:03:01.410> of<00:03:01.530> time<00:03:01.680> you<00:03:02.450> could<00:03:03.450> change<00:03:03.690> those

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:09.860 

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:12.500 

looks<00:03:10.860> great<00:03:11.220> I<00:03:11.400> think<00:03:12.030> you<00:03:12.120> save<00:03:12.300> about
