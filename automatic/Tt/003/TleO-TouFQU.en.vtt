so like we're setting up the animals
like<00:04:04.100> so<00:04:04.280> they<00:04:04.370> can<00:04:04.520> become<00:04:04.760> pang<00:04:04.970> in<00:04:05.210> like

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:05.630 
like so they can become pang in like

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:07.900 
like so they can become pang in like
someone<00:04:06.200> for<00:04:06.440> them<00:04:06.530> to<00:04:06.650> all<00:04:06.860> their<00:04:07.130> talk<00:04:07.340> to<00:04:07.640> or

someone for them to all their talk to or
you<00:04:08.000> know<00:04:08.090> like<00:04:08.240> just<00:04:08.390> basically<00:04:08.960> double

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:09.350 
you know like just basically double

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:11.280 
you know like just basically double
pointed<00:04:09.620> so<00:04:09.740> they<00:04:09.830> won't<00:04:10.040> feel<00:04:10.550> alone<00:04:10.670> because

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:11.290 
pointed so they won't feel alone because

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:22.330 
pointed so they won't feel alone because
that's<00:04:12.290> what<00:04:12.830> I<00:04:12.860> meet<00:04:13.160> you

00:04:22.330 --> 00:04:22.340 

00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:26.780 

okay<00:04:23.340> so<00:04:23.400> why<00:04:23.699> did<00:04:23.880> we<00:04:24.000> choose<00:04:24.030> Iraq

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:26.790 
okay so why did we choose Iraq

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:29.600 
okay so why did we choose Iraq
all<00:04:27.360> the<00:04:27.600> reason<00:04:27.930> we<00:04:28.050> chose<00:04:28.080> our<00:04:28.410> exit<00:04:28.860> schools

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:29.610 
all the reason we chose our exit schools

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:32.300 
all the reason we chose our exit schools
like<00:04:30.060> is<00:04:30.990> because<00:04:31.500> without<00:04:31.710> the<00:04:32.040> school

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:32.310 
like is because without the school

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:34.570 
like is because without the school
supplies<00:04:32.700> they<00:04:32.970> won't<00:04:33.180> have<00:04:33.330> an<00:04:33.480> education

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:34.580
