00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:19.580 
primitive parts of that for me it's got

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:22.120 
primitive parts of that for me it's got
a<00:01:19.880> raddest<00:01:20.420> thing<00:01:20.510> to<00:01:20.840> watch<00:01:21.260> go<00:01:21.500> down<00:01:21.740> there's

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:22.130 
a raddest thing to watch go down there's

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:23.590 
a raddest thing to watch go down there's
a<00:01:22.220> lot<00:01:22.370> of<00:01:22.490> stage<00:01:22.729> and<00:01:23.030> so<00:01:23.210> making<00:01:23.420> a

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:23.600 
a lot of stage and so making a

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.270 
a lot of stage and so making a
skateboarder<00:01:24.200> and<00:01:24.229> I<00:01:24.560> don't<00:01:24.770> know<00:01:24.950> a<00:01:24.979> lot

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:25.280 
skateboarder and I don't know a lot

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.040 
skateboarder and I don't know a lot
about<00:01:25.310> that<00:01:25.700> but<00:01:25.880> Paul<00:01:26.090> does<00:01:26.390> and<00:01:26.720> that's<00:01:26.900> why

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:27.050 
about that but Paul does and that's why

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:28.740 
about that but Paul does and that's why
we<00:01:27.200> came<00:01:27.350> here<00:01:27.410> this<00:01:27.800> Paul's<00:01:28.040> really<00:01:28.250> good<00:01:28.550> at

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:28.750 
we came here this Paul's really good at

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.359 
we came here this Paul's really good at
explain<00:01:29.750> it<00:01:29.900> to<00:01:29.990> people<00:01:30.020> our<00:01:30.619> skateboards<00:01:31.250> are
