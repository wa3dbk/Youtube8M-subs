00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:02.890 
I took the supplied 12-volt power line

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:04.890 
I took the supplied 12-volt power line
that<00:01:02.920> comes<00:01:03.220> with<00:01:03.460> it<00:01:03.640> I<00:01:03.820> plugged<00:01:04.600> it<00:01:04.720> in<00:01:04.809> the

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:33.010 
this is the wire that actually came with

00:01:33.010 --> 00:01:35.400 
this is the wire that actually came with

in<00:01:35.680> the<00:01:35.920> thickness<00:01:36.130> the<00:01:36.370> gauge<00:01:36.930> this<00:01:37.930> is<00:01:37.990> the

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:38.080 
in the thickness the gauge this is the

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:40.080 
in the thickness the gauge this is the
end<00:01:38.230> is<00:01:38.409> the<00:01:38.560> out<00:01:38.680> doesn't<00:01:39.430> make<00:01:39.520> any<00:01:39.670> sense<00:01:39.850> to

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:55.740 
Thunder ac6 and right as I plug it in
the<00:01:52.570> side<00:01:52.720> here<00:01:54.090> plug<00:01:55.090> it<00:01:55.210> to<00:01:55.270> my<00:01:55.360> power<00:01:55.570> supply

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:55.750 
the side here plug it to my power supply

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:57.960 
the side here plug it to my power supply
plugged<00:01:56.470> it<00:01:56.590> in<00:01:56.710> I<00:01:56.890> noticed<00:01:57.460> right<00:01:57.729> away<00:01:57.790> that

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:57.970 
plugged it in I noticed right away that

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:00.570 
plugged it in I noticed right away that
the<00:01:58.180> input<00:01:58.510> current<00:01:58.540> was<00:01:59.050> much<00:01:59.409> higher<00:01:59.680> more

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:00.580 
the input current was much higher more

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.180 
the input current was much higher more
more<00:02:00.940> steady<00:02:01.360> and<00:02:02.110> so<00:02:02.530> is<00:02:02.650> the<00:02:02.740> output<00:02:02.860> current

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:03.190 
more steady and so is the output current

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:05.039 
more steady and so is the output current
so<00:02:03.430> I<00:02:03.580> tried<00:02:03.820> charging<00:02:04.240> 2<00:02:04.390> 3<00:02:04.600> batteries<00:02:04.900> with

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:05.049 
so I tried charging 2 3 batteries with

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:07.950 
so I tried charging 2 3 batteries with
it<00:02:05.140> no<00:02:05.950> issues<00:02:06.250> whatsoever<00:02:06.420> so<00:02:07.420> whatever<00:02:07.810> they

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:07.960 
it no issues whatsoever so whatever they

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.440 
it no issues whatsoever so whatever they
did<00:02:08.409> I<00:02:08.440> don't<00:02:08.619> know<00:02:08.799> who's<00:02:09.580> the<00:02:09.909> genius<00:02:10.090> that

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450 
did I don't know who's the genius that

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.390 
did I don't know who's the genius that
came<00:02:10.509> up<00:02:10.780> with<00:02:10.899> a<00:02:10.959> little<00:02:11.230> tiny<00:02:11.470> wire<00:02:12.159> like

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:12.400 
came up with a little tiny wire like

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.070 
came up with a little tiny wire like
this<00:02:12.430> but<00:02:13.209> it<00:02:13.269> doesn't<00:02:13.510> work<00:02:13.599> so<00:02:13.900> what<00:02:14.019> I'm

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:14.080 
this but it doesn't work so what I'm

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.119 
this but it doesn't work so what I'm
going<00:02:14.230> to<00:02:14.260> do<00:02:14.349> is<00:02:14.409> I'm<00:02:14.500> gonna<00:02:14.590> make<00:02:14.650> myself<00:02:14.890> up

00:02:15.119 --> 00:02:15.129 
going to do is I'm gonna make myself up

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:17.580 
going to do is I'm gonna make myself up
another<00:02:15.340> one<00:02:15.549> like<00:02:16.450> this

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:17.590 
another one like this

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:19.530 
another one like this
and<00:02:18.489> use<00:02:18.700> it<00:02:18.790> for<00:02:18.880> the<00:02:18.970> input<00:02:19.150> with<00:02:19.270> a<00:02:19.300> heavy

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:19.540 
and use it for the input with a heavy

00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:21.690 
and use it for the input with a heavy
gauge<00:02:19.750> input<00:02:20.140> where<00:02:20.319> that's<00:02:21.010> all<00:02:21.160> that's<00:02:21.520> the

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
gauge input where that's all that's the

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:23.850 
gauge input where that's all that's the
issue<00:02:21.790> with<00:02:22.060> this<00:02:22.180> but<00:02:22.660> besides<00:02:22.989> that<00:02:23.110> these

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:23.860 
issue with this but besides that these

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.589 
issue with this but besides that these
two<00:02:24.069> Chargers<00:02:25.170> they<00:02:26.170> are<00:02:26.790> identical<00:02:27.790> the<00:02:28.569> same

00:02:28.589 --> 00:02:28.599 
two Chargers they are identical the same

00:02:28.599 --> 00:02:30.330 
two Chargers they are identical the same
thing<00:02:29.050> the<00:02:29.590> only<00:02:29.680> difference<00:02:29.770> if<00:02:30.040> you<00:02:30.099> look<00:02:30.250> at

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:30.340 
thing the only difference if you look at

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:34.710 
thing the only difference if you look at
the<00:02:30.400> sides<00:02:30.900> this<00:02:31.900> one<00:02:32.110> has<00:02:33.300> the<00:02:34.300> temperature

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
the sides this one has the temperature

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.770 
the sides this one has the temperature
sensor<00:02:35.140> and<00:02:35.349> the<00:02:36.190> USB<00:02:36.610> connector<00:02:37.150> here<00:02:37.390> this

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:37.780 
sensor and the USB connector here this

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.000 
sensor and the USB connector here this
one's<00:02:37.959> got<00:02:38.110> the<00:02:38.140> temperature<00:02:38.590> sensor<00:02:38.890> but

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.010 
one's got the temperature sensor but

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:40.680 
one's got the temperature sensor but
it's<00:02:39.099> kind<00:02:39.250> of<00:02:39.280> like<00:02:39.400> buried<00:02:40.120> inside<00:02:40.239> here

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
it's kind of like buried inside here

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:42.570 
it's kind of like buried inside here
it's<00:02:41.349> supposed<00:02:41.680> to<00:02:41.800> have<00:02:41.920> see<00:02:42.160> it<00:02:42.220> even<00:02:42.370> says

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:42.580 
it's supposed to have see it even says

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:45.360 
it's supposed to have see it even says
USB<00:02:43.090> adapter<00:02:43.540> here<00:02:43.690> unless<00:02:44.650> you<00:02:44.830> open<00:02:45.040> it<00:02:45.160> up<00:02:45.250> I

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:45.370 
USB adapter here unless you open it up I

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:46.710 
USB adapter here unless you open it up I
don't<00:02:45.519> see<00:02:45.640> USB<00:02:46.030> adapter<00:02:46.420> in<00:02:46.510> there<00:02:46.630> it's

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:46.720 
don't see USB adapter in there it's

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.240 
don't see USB adapter in there it's
probably<00:02:46.959> on<00:02:47.050> the<00:02:47.140> board<00:02:47.380> somewhere<00:02:47.620> but<00:02:48.220> I

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.250 
probably on the board somewhere but I

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.059 
probably on the board somewhere but I
never<00:02:48.430> really<00:02:48.730> looked<00:02:48.910> for<00:02:49.150> it<00:02:49.260> this<00:02:50.260> one<00:02:50.530> has

00:02:51.059 --> 00:02:51.069 
never really looked for it this one has

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:54.360 
never really looked for it this one has
got<00:02:51.220> a<00:02:51.280> breakout<00:02:51.700> board<00:02:52.000> for<00:02:52.930> charging<00:02:53.350> or<00:02:54.250> you

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:54.370 
got a breakout board for charging or you

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:55.320 
got a breakout board for charging or you
could<00:02:54.489> just<00:02:54.519> plug<00:02:54.730> it<00:02:54.880> right<00:02:54.910> in<00:02:55.060> the<00:02:55.120> side

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:55.330 
could just plug it right in the side

00:02:55.330 --> 00:03:00.949 
could just plug it right in the side
here<00:02:56.250> whereas<00:02:57.250> the<00:02:57.489> other<00:02:57.670> one<00:02:58.769> the<00:02:59.769> IMAX<00:03:00.160> has

00:03:00.949 --> 00:03:00.959 
here whereas the other one the IMAX has

00:03:00.959 --> 00:03:03.120 
here whereas the other one the IMAX has
them<00:03:01.959> like<00:03:02.110> this<00:03:02.319> so<00:03:02.470> you<00:03:02.560> can<00:03:02.620> plug<00:03:02.830> different

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:03.130 
them like this so you can plug different

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:04.050 
them like this so you can plug different
cells<00:03:03.340> in<00:03:03.400> but<00:03:03.549> it's<00:03:03.640> basically<00:03:03.849> the<00:03:03.970> same

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:04.060 
cells in but it's basically the same

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:05.490 
cells in but it's basically the same
thing<00:03:04.209> you<00:03:04.420> could<00:03:04.630> just<00:03:04.780> get<00:03:04.870> a<00:03:04.900> breakup<00:03:05.260> board

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:05.500 
thing you could just get a breakup board

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.050 
thing you could just get a breakup board
plug<00:03:05.709> it<00:03:05.830> in<00:03:05.920> here<00:03:06.099> we'll<00:03:06.580> do<00:03:06.700> the<00:03:06.819> exact<00:03:07.030> same

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:07.060 
plug it in here we'll do the exact same

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:08.699 
plug it in here we'll do the exact same
thing<00:03:07.420> as<00:03:07.510> that<00:03:07.690> one<00:03:07.900> but<00:03:08.349> you<00:03:08.380> know<00:03:08.470> what<00:03:08.620> the

00:03:08.699 --> 00:03:08.709 
thing as that one but you know what the

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:11.009 
thing as that one but you know what the
programming<00:03:09.220> is<00:03:09.310> same<00:03:09.489> to<00:03:09.610> set<00:03:09.849> up<00:03:09.970> what<00:03:10.780> I<00:03:10.810> did

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:11.019 
programming is same to set up what I did

00:03:11.019 --> 00:03:12.990 
programming is same to set up what I did
is<00:03:11.230> this<00:03:11.380> one<00:03:11.650> I<00:03:11.830> actually<00:03:11.920> calibrated<00:03:12.819> the

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
is this one I actually calibrated the

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.240 
is this one I actually calibrated the
original<00:03:13.390> Thunder<00:03:13.750> just<00:03:14.290> go<00:03:14.410> into<00:03:14.650> the<00:03:14.980> menu

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
original Thunder just go into the menu

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:17.839 
original Thunder just go into the menu
when<00:03:15.400> you<00:03:15.430> plug<00:03:15.670> it<00:03:15.790> in<00:03:15.880> you<00:03:15.940> hit<00:03:16.090> start<00:03:16.390> and

00:03:17.839 --> 00:03:17.849 
when you plug it in you hit start and

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:20.759 
when you plug it in you hit start and
decline<00:03:18.849> press<00:03:19.810> on<00:03:19.900> both<00:03:20.049> the<00:03:20.140> same<00:03:20.290> time<00:03:20.500> plug

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:20.769 
decline press on both the same time plug

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:22.020 
decline press on both the same time plug
your<00:03:20.890> power<00:03:21.040> and<00:03:21.280> keep<00:03:21.430> holding<00:03:21.579> it<00:03:21.820> and<00:03:21.970> you

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:22.030 
your power and keep holding it and you

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:24.090 
your power and keep holding it and you
can<00:03:22.630> go<00:03:22.750> into<00:03:22.870> the<00:03:22.989> battery<00:03:23.320> menu<00:03:23.620> and<00:03:23.799> you<00:03:24.010> can

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:24.100 
can go into the battery menu and you can

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:26.310 
can go into the battery menu and you can
actually<00:03:24.310> calibrate<00:03:25.239> your<00:03:25.660> battery<00:03:26.019> to<00:03:26.200> this

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:26.320 
actually calibrate your battery to this

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:27.630 
actually calibrate your battery to this
so<00:03:26.530> they<00:03:26.620> both<00:03:26.739> have<00:03:26.920> the<00:03:27.040> exact<00:03:27.250> same<00:03:27.280> voltage

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:27.640 
so they both have the exact same voltage

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:29.880 
so they both have the exact same voltage
it'll<00:03:28.150> charge<00:03:28.329> better<00:03:28.660> so<00:03:29.320> this<00:03:29.470> one<00:03:29.620> was<00:03:29.769> off

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:29.890 
it'll charge better so this one was off

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:31.710 
it'll charge better so this one was off
by<00:03:30.070> about<00:03:30.160> 2<00:03:30.609> points<00:03:31.000> or<00:03:31.269> something<00:03:31.480> like<00:03:31.630> that

by about 2 points or something like that

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.390 
by about 2 points or something like that
when<00:03:31.840> I<00:03:31.870> got<00:03:32.019> our<00:03:32.140> three<00:03:32.380> points<00:03:32.709> on<00:03:32.950> the<00:03:33.160> plus

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
when I got our three points on the plus

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.490 
when I got our three points on the plus
or<00:03:33.519> minus<00:03:33.819> and<00:03:34.090> this<00:03:34.720> one<00:03:34.930> was<00:03:35.109> the<00:03:35.140> exact<00:03:35.470> same

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
or minus and this one was the exact same

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.140 
or minus and this one was the exact same
thing<00:03:35.890> when<00:03:36.010> I<00:03:36.040> got<00:03:36.190> it<00:03:36.400> same<00:03:36.670> thing<00:03:36.700> so<00:03:37.090> I

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
thing when I got it same thing so I

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.780 
thing when I got it same thing so I
calibrated<00:03:37.750> it<00:03:37.900> also<00:03:38.049> so<00:03:38.890> they<00:03:39.489> should<00:03:39.760> be

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:39.790 
calibrated it also so they should be

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:41.729 
calibrated it also so they should be
reading<00:03:40.180> perfectly<00:03:40.690> now<00:03:40.840> anyways<00:03:41.410> I<00:03:41.500> checked

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:41.739 
reading perfectly now anyways I checked

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:43.590 
reading perfectly now anyways I checked
with<00:03:41.829> my<00:03:41.859> battery<00:03:42.340> meter<00:03:42.549> and<00:03:42.850> what<00:03:43.269> this<00:03:43.420> is

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:43.600 
with my battery meter and what this is

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.599 
with my battery meter and what this is
reading<00:03:43.870> they<00:03:44.260> seem<00:03:44.470> to<00:03:44.530> be<00:03:44.590> identical<00:03:44.890> now<00:03:45.370> so

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:45.609 
reading they seem to be identical now so

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:48.180 
reading they seem to be identical now so
anyways<00:03:45.910> but<00:03:46.690> besides<00:03:47.049> that<00:03:47.260> I'm<00:03:48.010> going<00:03:48.160> to

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:48.190 
anyways but besides that I'm going to

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:49.559 
anyways but besides that I'm going to
keep<00:03:48.310> playing<00:03:48.459> with<00:03:48.670> it<00:03:48.700> before<00:03:49.209> I<00:03:49.359> really

00:03:49.559 --> 00:03:49.569 
keep playing with it before I really

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:50.849 
keep playing with it before I really
trust<00:03:49.870> it<00:03:49.989> you<00:03:50.049> know<00:03:50.200> to<00:03:50.260> leave<00:03:50.470> it<00:03:50.560> alone<00:03:50.620> or

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:50.859 
trust it you know to leave it alone or

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:52.920 
trust it you know to leave it alone or
something<00:03:50.980> which<00:03:51.430> I<00:03:51.579> shouldn't<00:03:51.940> anyway<00:03:52.090> but

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930 
something which I shouldn't anyway but

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.020 
something which I shouldn't anyway but
make<00:03:53.470> up<00:03:53.590> a<00:03:53.650> new<00:03:53.739> power<00:03:53.980> lead<00:03:54.160> for<00:03:54.400> it<00:03:54.519> and<00:03:54.609> see

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:55.030 
make up a new power lead for it and see

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.650 
make up a new power lead for it and see
what<00:03:55.150> happens

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:55.660 
what happens

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:57.150

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:42.760 
the power supply from the inside sorry

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:44.040 
the power supply from the inside sorry
the<00:04:42.820> cameras<00:04:43.090> will<00:04:43.180> shake<00:04:43.390> it<00:04:43.510> on<00:04:43.570> my<00:04:43.720> tripod

this<00:04:44.650> was<00:04:44.860> what's<00:04:45.040> inside<00:04:45.610> of<00:04:45.640> it<00:04:45.880> for<00:04:46.030> the

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:46.090 
this was what's inside of it for the

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:47.940 
this was what's inside of it for the
power<00:04:46.270> supply<00:04:46.480> I<00:04:46.870> pulled<00:04:47.530> it<00:04:47.620> out<00:04:47.680> a<00:04:47.740> sealed

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:47.950 
power supply I pulled it out a sealed

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:49.710 
power supply I pulled it out a sealed
two<00:04:48.070> little<00:04:48.280> wires<00:04:48.400> I<00:04:48.610> just<00:04:48.850> and<00:04:48.970> solder<00:04:49.210> it<00:04:49.390> if

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:49.720 
two little wires I just and solder it if

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:52.170 
two little wires I just and solder it if
I<00:04:49.780> assume<00:04:49.990> that<00:04:50.050> was<00:04:50.260> 12<00:04:50.500> volt<00:04:50.710> out<00:04:50.970> anyways<00:04:51.970> I

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:52.180 
I assume that was 12 volt out anyways I

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:54.180 
I assume that was 12 volt out anyways I
put<00:04:52.480> it<00:04:52.600> inside<00:04:52.720> took<00:04:53.380> this<00:04:53.560> side<00:04:53.740> of<00:04:53.860> it<00:04:53.950> apart

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:54.190 
put it inside took this side of it apart

00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:57.630 
put it inside took this side of it apart
here<00:04:54.460> I<00:04:55.650> just<00:04:56.650> ran<00:04:57.010> the<00:04:57.040> wire<00:04:57.280> and<00:04:57.460> I'm<00:04:57.520> going

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:57.640 
here I just ran the wire and I'm going

00:04:57.640 --> 00:04:58.920 
here I just ran the wire and I'm going
to<00:04:57.670> find<00:04:57.820> a<00:04:57.910> way<00:04:58.000> to<00:04:58.030> secure<00:04:58.360> this<00:04:58.540> I<00:04:58.660> don't<00:04:58.780> rip

it<00:04:58.990> off<00:04:59.110> the<00:04:59.230> board<00:04:59.440> just<00:04:59.500> in<00:04:59.710> case<00:04:59.950> so<00:05:00.280> I'm

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:00.370 
it off the board just in case so I'm

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:01.410 
it off the board just in case so I'm
going<00:05:00.520> to<00:05:00.550> fix<00:05:00.700> that<00:05:00.820> later<00:05:00.970> on<00:05:01.210> when<00:05:01.330> I<00:05:01.360> get

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:01.420 
going to fix that later on when I get

going to fix that later on when I get
home<00:05:01.660> but<00:05:01.870> I<00:05:02.350> put<00:05:02.620> a<00:05:02.650> nice<00:05:02.950> heavy<00:05:03.400> gauge<00:05:03.670> wire

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:03.700 
home but I put a nice heavy gauge wire

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:06.030 
home but I put a nice heavy gauge wire
look<00:05:04.360> at<00:05:04.480> size<00:05:04.690> of<00:05:04.720> this<00:05:04.870> stuff<00:05:05.110> this<00:05:05.680> is<00:05:05.830> great

00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:06.040 
look at size of this stuff this is great

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:07.620 
look at size of this stuff this is great
I<00:05:06.070> use<00:05:06.280> this<00:05:06.370> for<00:05:06.580> car<00:05:06.790> audio<00:05:06.820> here<00:05:07.270> in<00:05:07.330> my<00:05:07.420> shop

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:07.630 
I use this for car audio here in my shop

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:10.770 
I use this for car audio here in my shop
and<00:05:07.870> it's<00:05:08.620> really<00:05:08.980> nice<00:05:09.130> wire<00:05:09.460> so<00:05:10.120> anyways<00:05:10.570> I

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:10.780 
and it's really nice wire so anyways I

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:12.660 
and it's really nice wire so anyways I
put<00:05:11.200> that<00:05:11.290> in<00:05:11.470> there<00:05:11.590> I<00:05:11.740> just<00:05:11.800> tried<00:05:12.160> it<00:05:12.190> out<00:05:12.430> I

00:05:12.660 --> 00:05:12.670 
put that in there I just tried it out I

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:13.740 
put that in there I just tried it out I
didn't<00:05:12.970> charge<00:05:13.090> anything<00:05:13.210> with<00:05:13.510> it<00:05:13.600> I<00:05:13.630> just

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:13.750 
didn't charge anything with it I just

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:15.480 
didn't charge anything with it I just
plugged<00:05:14.020> into<00:05:14.230> it<00:05:14.470> and<00:05:14.650> see<00:05:15.040> what<00:05:15.130> I<00:05:15.190> would<00:05:15.310> do

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:15.490 
plugged into it and see what I would do

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:17.280 
plugged into it and see what I would do
and<00:05:15.790> it<00:05:16.150> lights<00:05:16.300> up<00:05:16.420> everything<00:05:16.690> is<00:05:16.870> to<00:05:17.140> work

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:17.290 
and it lights up everything is to work

00:05:17.290 --> 00:05:19.110 
and it lights up everything is to work
the<00:05:17.440> voltage<00:05:17.740> just<00:05:17.890> seemed<00:05:18.040> to<00:05:18.100> be<00:05:18.190> okay<00:05:18.490> so

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:19.120 
the voltage just seemed to be okay so

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:20.400 
the voltage just seemed to be okay so
anyways<00:05:19.360> I'll<00:05:19.480> do<00:05:19.570> further<00:05:19.780> testing<00:05:20.170> with<00:05:20.290> it

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:20.410 
anyways I'll do further testing with it

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:21.690 
anyways I'll do further testing with it
but<00:05:20.590> for<00:05:21.100> now<00:05:21.130> I<00:05:21.220> think<00:05:21.280> that's<00:05:21.490> going<00:05:21.640> to

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:21.700 
but for now I think that's going to

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:23.610 
but for now I think that's going to

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:24.790 
that way I don't have to carry extra

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:26.040 
that way I don't have to carry extra
adapters<00:05:25.300> around<00:05:25.510> they<00:05:25.570> just<00:05:25.720> plug<00:05:25.870> it<00:05:25.990> right

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:26.050 
adapters around they just plug it right

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:28.380 
adapters around they just plug it right
to<00:05:26.170> a<00:05:26.230> battery<00:05:26.500> problem<00:05:27.190> solved<00:05:28.030> anyways

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:28.390
