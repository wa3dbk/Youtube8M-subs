using creative arts in his classroom he
stated<00:04:06.650> I<00:04:07.060> mean<00:04:08.060> I<00:04:08.300> think<00:04:08.600> not<00:04:09.050> only<00:04:09.320> do

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:09.470 
stated I mean I think not only do

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:11.110 
stated I mean I think not only do
students<00:04:09.890> learn<00:04:10.010> the<00:04:10.310> content<00:04:10.700> better<00:04:10.880> I

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120 
students learn the content better I

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.360 
students learn the content better I
think<00:04:11.870> it's<00:04:12.020> easier<00:04:12.380> to<00:04:12.410> teach<00:04:12.710> as<00:04:12.980> a<00:04:13.040> teacher

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:13.370 
think it's easier to teach as a teacher

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:15.430 
think it's easier to teach as a teacher
because<00:04:14.150> the<00:04:14.450> students<00:04:14.810> have<00:04:14.960> a<00:04:14.990> lot<00:04:15.170> more<00:04:15.200> to

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:15.440 
because the students have a lot more to

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.160 
because the students have a lot more to
be<00:04:15.530> engaged<00:04:15.860> in<00:04:16.130> I<00:04:16.570> think<00:04:17.570> it<00:04:17.690> cuts<00:04:17.900> down<00:04:18.110> on

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:18.170 
be engaged in I think it cuts down on

be engaged in I think it cuts down on
