change it to the same green color I'd

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.460 
change it to the same green color I'd
highly<00:01:09.299> recommend<00:01:09.330> as<00:01:09.810> you<00:01:09.930> guys<00:01:10.049> can<00:01:10.170> see<00:01:10.229> now

highly recommend as you guys can see now

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:11.840 
highly recommend as you guys can see now
what<00:01:10.590> I'm<00:01:10.650> gonna<00:01:10.740> do<00:01:10.950> is<00:01:11.189> change<00:01:11.490> it<00:01:11.640> on<00:01:11.760> to

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850 
what I'm gonna do is change it on to

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.789 
what I'm gonna do is change it on to
free<00:01:12.090> scale<00:01:12.360> and<00:01:12.540> play<00:01:13.200> around<00:01:13.530> slightly

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
free scale and play around slightly

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:14.810 
free scale and play around slightly
gonna<00:01:14.070> make<00:01:14.159> up<00:01:14.250> to<00:01:14.340> make<00:01:14.460> it<00:01:14.549> slightly

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
gonna make up to make it slightly

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.670 
gonna make up to make it slightly
thinner<00:01:15.180> and<00:01:15.450> that's<00:01:15.960> because<00:01:16.259> if<00:01:16.380> you<00:01:16.470> put

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
thinner and that's because if you put

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.580 
thinner and that's because if you put
the<00:01:16.830> default<00:01:17.640> heart<00:01:18.000> shape<00:01:18.409> chances<00:01:19.409> are<00:01:19.560> that

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
the default heart shape chances are that

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.140 
the default heart shape chances are that
they're<00:01:19.860> gonna<00:01:19.950> clash<00:01:20.310> into<00:01:20.610> each<00:01:20.729> other<00:01:20.939> and

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
they're gonna clash into each other and

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.780 
they're gonna clash into each other and
you<00:01:21.869> don't<00:01:21.900> have<00:01:22.259> any<00:01:22.439> space<00:01:22.710> so<00:01:23.040> as<00:01:23.549> you<00:01:23.670> can

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
you don't have any space so as you can

and we have to change this around on the

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.050 
and we have to change this around on the
fix<00:02:12.080> Freescale<00:02:12.680> I<00:02:12.830> highly<00:02:13.340> recommend<00:02:13.730> playing

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:14.060 
fix Freescale I highly recommend playing

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:15.310

around<00:02:14.330> with<00:02:14.480> it<00:02:14.630> I<00:02:14.690> think<00:02:14.750> it's<00:02:14.960> little

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:15.320 
around with it I think it's little

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.350 
around with it I think it's little
bottom<00:02:15.770> right<00:02:16.100> or<00:02:16.340> the<00:02:16.430> bottom<00:02:16.460> left<00:02:17.060> one<00:02:17.300> of

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360 
bottom right or the bottom left one of

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:18.850 
bottom right or the bottom left one of
the<00:02:17.420> two<00:02:17.600> and<00:02:17.810> it's<00:02:18.140> gonna<00:02:18.230> make<00:02:18.380> it<00:02:18.500> thin<00:02:18.710> and

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
the two and it's gonna make it thin and

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.710 
the two and it's gonna make it thin and
then<00:02:19.340> we're<00:02:19.460> gonna<00:02:19.550> do<00:02:19.730> is<00:02:19.820> clone<00:02:20.090> it<00:02:20.240> over<00:02:20.570> and

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720 
then we're gonna do is clone it over and

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.840 
then we're gonna do is clone it over and
then<00:02:21.080> as<00:02:21.860> you<00:02:21.950> can<00:02:22.040> see<00:02:22.160> I'm<00:02:22.310> just<00:02:22.370> putting<00:02:22.730> it

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:22.850 
then as you can see I'm just putting it

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:27.250 
then as you can see I'm just putting it
on<00:02:22.940> each<00:02:23.270> leaf<00:02:24.080> and<00:02:25.540> make<00:02:26.540> sure<00:02:26.660> it<00:02:26.780> connects

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.260 
on each leaf and make sure it connects

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:28.720 
on each leaf and make sure it connects
to<00:02:27.350> the<00:02:27.440> middle<00:02:27.680> bit<00:02:27.770> of<00:02:27.890> the<00:02:28.010> heart<00:02:28.220> so<00:02:28.520> that

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
to the middle bit of the heart so that

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.240 
to the middle bit of the heart so that
way<00:02:28.850> it<00:02:29.060> looks<00:02:29.330> like<00:02:29.600> the<00:02:29.840> actual<00:02:30.100> emblem<00:02:31.100> of

the<00:02:43.400> Celtic<00:02:43.700> rang<00:02:43.880> on<00:02:44.030> there<00:02:44.150> as<00:02:44.240> well<00:02:44.480> but

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:45.200 
the Celtic rang on there as well but

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.510 
the Celtic rang on there as well but
going<00:02:45.470> and<00:02:45.620> grabbing<00:02:45.710> the<00:02:45.980> scribble<00:02:46.310> over

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:46.520 
going and grabbing the scribble over

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.340 
going and grabbing the scribble over
here<00:02:46.730> we're<00:02:47.180> gonna<00:02:47.270> stretch<00:02:47.630> out<00:02:47.840> slightly<00:02:48.200> it

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:48.350 
here we're gonna stretch out slightly it

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:50.199 
here we're gonna stretch out slightly it
will<00:02:48.380> go<00:02:48.800> into<00:02:49.100> the<00:02:49.430> top<00:02:49.670> corner<00:02:49.700> of<00:02:50.090> your

00:02:50.199 --> 00:02:50.209 
will go into the top corner of your

00:02:50.209 --> 00:02:52.690 
will go into the top corner of your
circle<00:02:50.709> but<00:02:51.709> that's<00:02:52.100> nothing<00:02:52.340> to<00:02:52.430> worry<00:02:52.550> about

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:52.700 
circle but that's nothing to worry about

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.550 
circle but that's nothing to worry about
and<00:02:52.970> as<00:02:53.060> you<00:02:53.150> can<00:02:53.240> see<00:02:53.300> on<00:02:53.540> opacity<00:02:54.110> we're

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:54.560 
and as you can see on opacity we're

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.199 
and as you can see on opacity we're
gonna<00:02:54.680> change<00:02:54.860> it<00:02:54.980> down<00:02:55.130> to<00:02:55.280> 20<00:02:55.580> I<00:02:55.730> think<00:02:56.150> I

00:02:56.199 --> 00:02:56.209 
gonna change it down to 20 I think I

00:02:56.209 --> 00:02:59.620 
gonna change it down to 20 I think I
kept<00:02:56.480> it<00:02:56.630> 20<00:02:57.020> yep<00:02:57.650> 20<00:02:57.980> and<00:02:58.160> we<00:02:59.120> put<00:02:59.420> it<00:02:59.510> behind

00:02:59.620 --> 00:02:59.630 
kept it 20 yep 20 and we put it behind

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:01.240 
kept it 20 yep 20 and we put it behind
to<00:03:00.080> layer<00:03:00.260> number<00:03:00.500> I<00:03:00.709> think<00:03:00.980> it's<00:03:01.070> layer

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
to layer number I think it's layer

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:03.480 
to layer number I think it's layer
number<00:03:01.400> you<00:03:02.150> can<00:03:02.240> put<00:03:02.360> it<00:03:02.420> to<00:03:02.480> layer<00:03:02.630> number<00:03:02.720> 11

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:03.490 
number you can put it to layer number 11

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:05.320 
number you can put it to layer number 11
and<00:03:04.490> that<00:03:04.610> the<00:03:04.760> reason<00:03:04.880> I've<00:03:05.030> done<00:03:05.150> that<00:03:05.209> is

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:05.330 
and that the reason I've done that is

00:03:05.330 --> 00:03:06.850 
and that the reason I've done that is
because<00:03:05.630> you<00:03:05.750> want<00:03:05.930> your<00:03:06.020> stem<00:03:06.320> to<00:03:06.470> stick<00:03:06.680> out

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:06.860 
because you want your stem to stick out

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:08.680 
because you want your stem to stick out
as<00:03:07.010> well<00:03:07.190> as<00:03:07.310> your<00:03:07.610> shuriken<00:03:08.180> and<00:03:08.360> but<00:03:08.510> in<00:03:08.630> the

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:08.690 
as well as your shuriken and but in the

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:12.490 
as well as your shuriken and but in the
background<00:03:08.870> then<00:03:09.860> I<00:03:09.920> go<00:03:10.070> grab<00:03:10.310> this<00:03:11.500> shape

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:12.500 
background then I go grab this shape

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:15.759 
background then I go grab this shape
call<00:03:12.860> high-voltage<00:03:14.170> and<00:03:15.170> this<00:03:15.350> just<00:03:15.560> for<00:03:15.650> that

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:15.769 
call high-voltage and this just for that

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:18.340 
call high-voltage and this just for that
slight<00:03:16.040> bit<00:03:16.310> with<00:03:16.940> the<00:03:17.150> date<00:03:17.840> on<00:03:18.080> the<00:03:18.200> bottom

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:18.350 
slight bit with the date on the bottom

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:19.960 
slight bit with the date on the bottom
I'm<00:03:18.890> gonna<00:03:19.040> change<00:03:19.280> it<00:03:19.370> to<00:03:19.430> that<00:03:19.610> green<00:03:19.820> color

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
I'm gonna change it to that green color

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:21.850 
I'm gonna change it to that green color
as<00:03:20.150> well<00:03:20.330> and<00:03:20.600> then<00:03:21.170> what<00:03:21.260> I<00:03:21.290> do<00:03:21.440> is<00:03:21.500> clone<00:03:21.739> it

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:21.860 
as well and then what I do is clone it

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:23.650 
as well and then what I do is clone it
over<00:03:22.190> move<00:03:22.730> it<00:03:22.850> around<00:03:22.940> and<00:03:23.180> just<00:03:23.300> press<00:03:23.480> the

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:23.660 
over move it around and just press the

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:25.540 
over move it around and just press the
back<00:03:23.989> button<00:03:24.019> I<00:03:24.380> think<00:03:24.560> it<00:03:24.680> is<00:03:24.769> and<00:03:25.040> it<00:03:25.250> was

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:25.550 
back button I think it is and it was

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:27.220 
back button I think it is and it was
basically<00:03:25.730> a<00:03:25.940> flip<00:03:26.300> that's<00:03:26.810> gonna<00:03:26.959> flip<00:03:27.200> it

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:27.230 
basically a flip that's gonna flip it

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:28.870 
basically a flip that's gonna flip it
around<00:03:27.380> perfectly<00:03:27.950> and<00:03:28.070> you<00:03:28.160> can<00:03:28.400> then<00:03:28.640> just

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:28.880 
around perfectly and you can then just

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.210 
around perfectly and you can then just
slightly<00:03:29.420> move<00:03:29.720> it<00:03:29.870> and<00:03:30.019> as<00:03:30.709> you<00:03:30.890> can<00:03:31.010> see<00:03:31.070> you

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
slightly move it and as you can see you

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:32.350 
slightly move it and as you can see you
guys<00:03:31.340> there<00:03:31.550> it's<00:03:31.670> fitting<00:03:32.000> in<00:03:32.120> quite<00:03:32.269> nicely

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:32.360 
guys there it's fitting in quite nicely

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.420 
guys there it's fitting in quite nicely
and<00:03:33.080> I'm<00:03:33.230> gonna<00:03:33.350> start<00:03:33.620> writing<00:03:33.890> in<00:03:34.070> the<00:03:34.220> day

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:34.430 
and I'm gonna start writing in the day

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:38.280 
and I'm gonna start writing in the day
over<00:03:34.640> there<00:03:34.910> which<00:03:35.090> i<00:03:35.209> think<00:03:35.269> is<00:03:35.739> 1888<00:03:36.739> and

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:38.290 
over there which i think is 1888 and

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:40.900 
over there which i think is 1888 and
just<00:03:39.290> get<00:03:39.410> your<00:03:39.500> writing<00:03:39.800> down<00:03:39.980> and<00:03:40.610> make<00:03:40.790> sure

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 
just get your writing down and make sure

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:42.370 
just get your writing down and make sure
it's<00:03:41.060> all<00:03:41.239> the<00:03:41.360> same<00:03:41.570> size<00:03:41.870> and<00:03:42.080> then<00:03:42.170> what<00:03:42.260> I'm

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:42.380 
it's all the same size and then what I'm

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:43.690 
it's all the same size and then what I'm
gonna<00:03:42.500> do<00:03:42.680> there<00:03:42.860> is<00:03:42.980> just<00:03:43.130> clone<00:03:43.370> them<00:03:43.519> over

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:43.700 
gonna do there is just clone them over

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:45.699 
gonna do there is just clone them over
as<00:03:43.820> I<00:03:43.910> said<00:03:44.060> before<00:03:44.180> and<00:03:44.780> once<00:03:45.440> I've<00:03:45.530> done<00:03:45.650> the

00:03:45.699 --> 00:03:45.709 
as I said before and once I've done the

00:03:45.709 --> 00:03:47.170 
as I said before and once I've done the
eight<00:03:45.890> I'm<00:03:46.070> just<00:03:46.190> going<00:03:46.340> to<00:03:46.400> clone<00:03:46.640> them<00:03:46.820> over

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:47.180 
eight I'm just going to clone them over

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:48.699 
eight I'm just going to clone them over
I<00:03:47.360> think<00:03:47.660> I'll<00:03:47.840> go<00:03:47.930> and<00:03:48.050> clone<00:03:48.200> over<00:03:48.470> the<00:03:48.560> eight

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:48.709 
I think I'll go and clone over the eight

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:50.650 
I think I'll go and clone over the eight
its<00:03:48.860> again<00:03:49.130> so<00:03:49.459> get<00:03:49.880> rid<00:03:49.970> of<00:03:50.060> those<00:03:50.150> ones<00:03:50.450> and

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:50.660 
its again so get rid of those ones and

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:52.630 
its again so get rid of those ones and
all<00:03:51.500> you<00:03:51.590> do<00:03:51.800> need<00:03:51.980> to<00:03:52.100> do<00:03:52.190> is<00:03:52.310> if<00:03:52.400> you<00:03:52.489> want<00:03:52.519> to

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:52.640 
all you do need to do is if you want to

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.240 
all you do need to do is if you want to
clone<00:03:52.850> guys<00:03:53.110> press<00:03:54.110> the<00:03:54.290> back<00:03:54.709> but<00:03:55.010> I<00:03:55.040> think

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:55.250 
clone guys press the back but I think

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:57.130 
clone guys press the back but I think
it's<00:03:55.340> the<00:03:55.630> after<00:03:56.630> doing<00:03:56.810> that<00:03:56.900> you<00:03:57.019> should

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:57.140 
it's the after doing that you should

00:03:57.140 --> 00:03:59.620 
it's the after doing that you should
press<00:03:57.290> the<00:03:57.380> back<00:03:57.560> button<00:03:57.590> and<00:03:58.300> as<00:03:59.300> you<00:03:59.420> can<00:03:59.480> see

00:03:59.620 --> 00:03:59.630 
press the back button and as you can see

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:00.610 
press the back button and as you can see
there<00:03:59.780> you<00:03:59.810> can<00:03:59.959> press<00:04:00.080> the<00:04:00.170> back<00:04:00.320> button<00:04:00.350> and

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:00.620 
there you can press the back button and

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:01.900 
there you can press the back button and
then<00:04:00.739> press<00:04:00.769> the<00:04:00.920> start<00:04:01.040> button<00:04:01.310> onto<00:04:01.580> a<00:04:01.700> new

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:01.910 
then press the start button onto a new

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:03.759 
then press the start button onto a new
layer<00:04:02.120> or<00:04:02.450> the<00:04:02.900> previous<00:04:03.410> layer<00:04:03.560> and<00:04:03.680> you'll

00:04:03.759 --> 00:04:03.769 
layer or the previous layer and you'll

00:04:03.769 --> 00:04:06.100 
layer or the previous layer and you'll
clone<00:04:03.920> it<00:04:04.070> over<00:04:04.220> that<00:04:04.370> one<00:04:04.489> so<00:04:05.060> as<00:04:05.840> you<00:04:05.959> can<00:04:06.049> see

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:06.110 
clone it over that one so as you can see

00:04:06.110 --> 00:04:07.180 
clone it over that one so as you can see
they're<00:04:06.320> just<00:04:06.350> getting<00:04:06.650> the<00:04:06.799> writing<00:04:07.070> all

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:07.190 
they're just getting the writing all

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:08.229 
they're just getting the writing all
there<00:04:07.400> and<00:04:07.489> then<00:04:07.610> we're<00:04:07.700> gonna<00:04:07.790> start<00:04:07.970> writing

00:04:08.229 --> 00:04:08.239 
there and then we're gonna start writing

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:10.120 
there and then we're gonna start writing
Celtic<00:04:08.630> over<00:04:08.900> the<00:04:09.019> top<00:04:09.260> so<00:04:09.799> this<00:04:09.920> is<00:04:10.010> pretty

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:10.130
