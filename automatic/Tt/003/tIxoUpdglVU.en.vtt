00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
bone meal however I do make a bit of a

mistake<00:01:02.550> here<00:01:02.960> it's<00:01:03.960> probably<00:01:04.320> a<00:01:04.350> little<00:01:04.470> bit

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
mistake here it's probably a little bit

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.770 
mistake here it's probably a little bit
further<00:01:04.830> down<00:01:05.010> in<00:01:05.220> the<00:01:05.339> video<00:01:05.580> but<00:01:06.330> there<00:01:06.659> is

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:06.780 
further down in the video but there is

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:09.920 
further down in the video but there is
one<00:01:07.020> crafting<00:01:07.439> recipe<00:01:07.799> for<00:01:08.100> B<00:01:08.720> there's<00:01:09.720> some

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
one crafting recipe for B there's some

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:11.630 
one crafting recipe for B there's some
sort<00:01:10.110> of<00:01:10.170> clay<00:01:10.380> from<00:01:10.439> one<00:01:10.770> factory<00:01:11.100> reloaded

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
sort of clay from one factory reloaded

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:13.880 
sort of clay from one factory reloaded
and<00:01:11.820> I<00:01:12.390> thought<00:01:12.540> it<00:01:12.659> was<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:12.810> same<00:01:12.990> thing<00:01:13.020> in

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:13.890 
and I thought it was the same thing in

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.499 
and I thought it was the same thing in
the<00:01:14.070> crafting<00:01:14.460> recipe<00:01:14.729> but<00:01:14.880> we<00:01:14.970> will<00:01:15.119> see<00:01:15.330> that

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
the crafting recipe but we will see that

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.510 
the crafting recipe but we will see that
here<00:01:15.810> in<00:01:15.869> a<00:01:15.960> second<00:01:16.350> because<00:01:17.070> I've<00:01:17.310> got<00:01:17.430> the

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
here in a second because I've got the

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.820 
here in a second because I've got the
two<00:01:17.670> bone<00:01:17.880> meal<00:01:18.090> so<00:01:19.080> I<00:01:19.140> thought<00:01:19.320> you<00:01:19.470> can<00:01:19.590> chuck

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
two bone meal so I thought you can chuck

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.890 
two bone meal so I thought you can chuck
this<00:01:19.950> in<00:01:20.100> the<00:01:20.250> crafting<00:01:20.580> grid<00:01:20.640> but<00:01:21.390> we<00:01:21.689> make

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:21.900 
this in the crafting grid but we make

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.810 
this in the crafting grid but we make
ceramic<00:01:22.320> clay<00:01:22.560> and<00:01:22.860> it's<00:01:23.100> the<00:01:23.220> wrong<00:01:23.369> type<00:01:23.610> and

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
ceramic clay and it's the wrong type and

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.050 
ceramic clay and it's the wrong type and
as<00:01:23.909> you<00:01:24.030> see<00:01:24.210> when<00:01:24.450> I<00:01:24.479> go<00:01:24.689> to<00:01:24.750> craft<00:01:25.140> myself<00:01:25.680> the

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.060 
as you see when I go to craft myself the

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.789 
as you see when I go to craft myself the
the<00:01:27.060> crucible<00:01:27.720> it<00:01:28.110> doesn't<00:01:28.439> work<00:01:28.560> because

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
the crucible it doesn't work because

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.679 
the crucible it doesn't work because
it's<00:01:29.100> the<00:01:29.220> wrong<00:01:29.340> clay<00:01:29.610> so<00:01:29.970> don't<00:01:30.420> go<00:01:30.540> doing

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689 
it's the wrong clay so don't go doing

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:31.910 
it's the wrong clay so don't go doing
that<00:01:30.930> guys<00:01:31.110> that<00:01:31.320> was<00:01:31.409> probably<00:01:31.560> the<00:01:31.680> wrong

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
that guys that was probably the wrong

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.440 
that guys that was probably the wrong
thing<00:01:32.159> to<00:01:32.189> do<00:01:32.460> you<00:01:32.790> can<00:01:32.820> see<00:01:33.030> we<00:01:33.119> want<00:01:33.270> to<00:01:33.360> make

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
thing to do you can see we want to make

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.660 
thing to do you can see we want to make
ourselves<00:01:33.600> some<00:01:34.320> of<00:01:34.350> the<00:01:34.500> other<00:01:34.710> clay<00:01:35.009> so

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
ourselves some of the other clay so

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.460 
ourselves some of the other clay so
while<00:01:36.060> I'm<00:01:36.270> waiting<00:01:36.299> to<00:01:36.689> get<00:01:36.750> my<00:01:36.869> bone<00:01:37.079> meal<00:01:37.290> I

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:46.740 
away from your main base so mobs are

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:50.090 
away from your main base so mobs are

stuff back at the main platform you want

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:56.060 
stuff back at the main platform you want
to<00:01:54.509> try<00:01:54.600> and<00:01:54.720> make<00:01:54.840> the<00:01:55.079> majority<00:01:55.649> of<00:01:55.920> your

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.240 
to try and make the majority of your

base of the half slabs on the bottom

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:00.709 
base of the half slabs on the bottom
side<00:01:59.460> so<00:01:59.490> the<00:01:59.790> mobs<00:01:59.969> can't<00:02:00.240> spawn<00:02:00.450> on<00:02:00.600> those

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
side so the mobs can't spawn on those

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.330 
side so the mobs can't spawn on those
either<00:02:00.899> and<00:02:01.649> you<00:02:01.710> want<00:02:01.860> to<00:02:01.920> make<00:02:02.009> sure<00:02:02.040> that

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
either and you want to make sure that

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.370 
either and you want to make sure that
the<00:02:02.460> sporting<00:02:02.880> platforms<00:02:03.329> are<00:02:03.509> with<00:02:03.899> normal

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
the sporting platforms are with normal

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.499 
the sporting platforms are with normal
full<00:02:04.530> sized<00:02:04.740> blocks<00:02:05.040> so<00:02:06.000> you<00:02:06.030> can<00:02:06.210> see<00:02:06.299> here

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
full sized blocks so you can see here

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.059 
full sized blocks so you can see here
I'm<00:02:06.600> starting<00:02:06.930> to<00:02:07.020> slowly<00:02:07.290> expand<00:02:07.890> the

00:02:08.059 --> 00:02:08.069 
I'm starting to slowly expand the

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:09.979 
I'm starting to slowly expand the
platform<00:02:08.580> around<00:02:09.000> you're<00:02:09.660> going<00:02:09.750> to<00:02:09.840> want<00:02:09.959> to

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
platform around you're going to want to

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:11.240 
platform around you're going to want to
put<00:02:10.110> a<00:02:10.140> fence<00:02:10.319> around<00:02:10.379> it<00:02:10.619> eventually<00:02:10.890> you'll

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
put a fence around it eventually you'll

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.570 
put a fence around it eventually you'll
see<00:02:11.370> that<00:02:11.489> in<00:02:11.610> the<00:02:11.670> video<00:02:11.879> when<00:02:12.239> we<00:02:12.270> do

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:12.580 
see that in the video when we do

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.430 
see that in the video when we do
that<00:02:12.730> but<00:02:13.000> yeah<00:02:13.660> you'll<00:02:13.900> say<00:02:14.020> that<00:02:14.050> so<00:02:14.350> I've

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
that but yeah you'll say that so I've

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:16.440 
that but yeah you'll say that so I've
got<00:02:14.620> two<00:02:14.800> big<00:02:15.400> platforms<00:02:15.880> there<00:02:16.030> they<00:02:16.180> can<00:02:16.330> you

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
got two big platforms there they can you

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.240 
got two big platforms there they can you
make<00:02:16.600> them<00:02:16.690> any<00:02:16.840> length<00:02:17.080> you<00:02:17.140> want<00:02:17.410> as<00:02:17.980> long<00:02:18.100> as

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:18.250 
make them any length you want as long as

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.550 
make them any length you want as long as
they're<00:02:18.430> well<00:02:18.820> I<00:02:19.000> suggest<00:02:19.420> too<00:02:19.600> wide<00:02:19.810> so<00:02:20.470> you

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:20.560 
they're well I suggest too wide so you

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.380 
they're well I suggest too wide so you
can<00:02:20.590> get<00:02:20.800> to<00:02:20.920> both<00:02:21.070> sides<00:02:21.370> of<00:02:21.520> them<00:02:21.610> from<00:02:21.880> each

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
can get to both sides of them from each

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:24.090 
can get to both sides of them from each
side<00:02:22.750> of<00:02:22.780> the<00:02:23.110> spawner<00:02:23.380> so<00:02:23.530> you<00:02:23.590> kill<00:02:23.800> all<00:02:24.010> the

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:24.100 
side of the spawner so you kill all the

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.210 
side of the spawner so you kill all the
mobs<00:02:24.280> when<00:02:24.520> they<00:02:24.610> start<00:02:24.880> spawning<00:02:25.120> in<00:02:25.330> there

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.220 
mobs when they start spawning in there

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.230 
mobs when they start spawning in there
so<00:02:27.220> yeah<00:02:27.490> you<00:02:27.550> can<00:02:27.700> see<00:02:27.790> how<00:02:27.850> four<00:02:28.000> torches

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:28.240 
so yeah you can see how four torches

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:29.520 
so yeah you can see how four torches
down<00:02:28.540> you<00:02:28.750> want<00:02:28.930> to<00:02:28.960> make<00:02:29.110> sure<00:02:29.140> you<00:02:29.320> put<00:02:29.500> some

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530 
down you want to make sure you put some

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.800 
down you want to make sure you put some
torches<00:02:29.770> down<00:02:30.160> just<00:02:30.970> in<00:02:31.090> case<00:02:31.210> it<00:02:31.360> tense<00:02:31.570> and

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:31.810 
torches down just in case it tense and

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.320 
torches down just in case it tense and
nighttime<00:02:32.140> like<00:02:32.350> it<00:02:32.470> has<00:02:32.620> here<00:02:32.940> so<00:02:33.940> mobs<00:02:34.210> don't

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:34.330 
nighttime like it has here so mobs don't

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:35.820 
nighttime like it has here so mobs don't
spawn<00:02:34.630> on<00:02:35.110> your<00:02:35.350> when<00:02:35.440> you're<00:02:35.560> back<00:02:35.680> at<00:02:35.770> the

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
spawn on your when you're back at the

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:36.810 
spawn on your when you're back at the
platform<00:02:36.220> and<00:02:36.280> then<00:02:36.400> you've<00:02:36.520> got<00:02:36.610> to<00:02:36.700> deal

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:36.820 
platform and then you've got to deal

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:38.040 
platform and then you've got to deal
with<00:02:36.970> those<00:02:37.120> when<00:02:37.270> you<00:02:37.390> come<00:02:37.570> back<00:02:37.750> to<00:02:37.900> keep

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:38.050 
with those when you come back to keep

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:38.820 
with those when you come back to keep
building<00:02:38.350> on<00:02:38.560> it

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:38.830 
building on it

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:41.820 
building on it
so<00:02:39.670> yeah<00:02:40.060> it's<00:02:40.630> slowly<00:02:40.840> expanding<00:02:41.560> this<00:02:41.650> out

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830 
so yeah it's slowly expanding this out

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:45.090 
so yeah it's slowly expanding this out
you<00:02:42.730> can<00:02:42.880> put<00:02:43.150> blocks<00:02:43.780> underneath<00:02:44.200> but<00:02:44.560> seeing

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:45.100 
you can put blocks underneath but seeing

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:46.590 
you can put blocks underneath but seeing
as<00:02:45.160> I<00:02:45.280> had<00:02:45.430> limited<00:02:45.760> resources<00:02:46.150> here<00:02:46.420> at<00:02:46.510> the

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:46.600 
as I had limited resources here at the

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.110 
as I had limited resources here at the
time<00:02:46.780> we've<00:02:47.590> sort<00:02:47.830> of<00:02:47.920> left<00:02:48.130> them<00:02:48.280> open<00:02:48.790> to<00:02:48.910> the

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.120 
time we've sort of left them open to the

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.580 
time we've sort of left them open to the
world<00:02:49.300> but<00:02:49.420> nothing<00:02:49.570> I'll<00:02:49.840> get<00:02:49.960> down<00:02:50.110> there<00:02:50.380> so

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
world but nothing I'll get down there so

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:51.720 
world but nothing I'll get down there so
that's<00:02:50.800> not<00:02:50.890> really<00:02:51.010> that<00:02:51.220> big<00:02:51.370> of<00:02:51.430> an<00:02:51.580> issue

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
that's not really that big of an issue

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:54.540 
that's not really that big of an issue
all<00:02:52.300> right<00:02:52.360> so<00:02:52.720> to<00:02:53.560> build<00:02:54.040> the<00:02:54.190> roof<00:02:54.310> on<00:02:54.490> this

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550 
all right so to build the roof on this

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:55.860 
all right so to build the roof on this
thing<00:02:54.610> you<00:02:54.790> want<00:02:54.940> to<00:02:54.970> make<00:02:55.030> it<00:02:55.240> a<00:02:55.270> three<00:02:55.660> high

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
thing you want to make it a three high

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:58.350 
thing you want to make it a three high
and<00:02:56.520> we'll<00:02:57.520> place<00:02:57.820> the<00:02:57.970> three<00:02:58.090> blocks<00:02:58.240> down

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
and we'll place the three blocks down

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.120 
and we'll place the three blocks down
like<00:02:58.570> you<00:02:58.660> saw<00:02:58.810> me<00:02:58.959> and<00:02:59.080> then<00:02:59.200> put<00:02:59.500> a<00:02:59.620> half<00:02:59.860> slab

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:00.130 
like you saw me and then put a half slab

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:03.210 
like you saw me and then put a half slab
on<00:03:00.340> top<00:03:00.430> and<00:03:01.410> remove<00:03:02.410> the<00:03:02.530> three<00:03:02.740> blocks<00:03:03.010> and

00:03:03.210 --> 00:03:03.220 
on top and remove the three blocks and

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:06.360 
on top and remove the three blocks and
start<00:03:03.760> filling<00:03:04.120> the<00:03:04.330> roof<00:03:04.570> in<00:03:04.810> like<00:03:05.230> so<00:03:05.680> and

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
start filling the roof in like so and

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.160 
start filling the roof in like so and
that<00:03:06.550> way<00:03:06.670> if<00:03:06.970> you<00:03:07.180> put<00:03:07.300> these<00:03:07.510> half<00:03:07.750> slabs<00:03:08.020> on

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:08.170 
that way if you put these half slabs on

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:09.449 
that way if you put these half slabs on
the<00:03:08.230> bottom<00:03:08.440> slab<00:03:08.620> on<00:03:08.800> the<00:03:08.890> top<00:03:09.070> of<00:03:09.220> the<00:03:09.280> roof

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
the bottom slab on the top of the roof

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:11.070 
the bottom slab on the top of the roof
that<00:03:09.700> way<00:03:10.180> you<00:03:10.270> won't<00:03:10.360> get<00:03:10.480> most<00:03:10.690> warning<00:03:10.990> up

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:11.080 
that way you won't get most warning up

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:12.990 
that way you won't get most warning up
there<00:03:11.260> either<00:03:11.470> and<00:03:11.800> that<00:03:11.830> is<00:03:12.310> that<00:03:12.640> is<00:03:12.760> good

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
there either and that is that is good

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.790 
there either and that is that is good
because<00:03:13.750> you<00:03:13.840> don't<00:03:13.870> want<00:03:14.110> most<00:03:14.290> fawning<00:03:14.680> on

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:14.800 
because you don't want most fawning on

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.080 
because you don't want most fawning on
you<00:03:15.040> when<00:03:15.190> you<00:03:15.310> don't<00:03:15.400> want<00:03:15.610> them<00:03:15.640> there<00:03:15.730> which

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:16.090 
you when you don't want them there which

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:17.940 
you when you don't want them there which
is<00:03:16.270> not<00:03:16.390> good<00:03:16.570> so<00:03:16.600> to<00:03:17.380> build<00:03:17.470> the<00:03:17.620> walls<00:03:17.830> you

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
is not good so to build the walls you

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:19.920 
is not good so to build the walls you
use<00:03:18.190> two<00:03:18.430> full<00:03:18.640> blocks<00:03:18.970> off<00:03:19.239> to<00:03:19.480> that<00:03:19.600> side

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:19.930 
use two full blocks off to that side

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:22.110 
use two full blocks off to that side
platform<00:03:20.800> as<00:03:21.250> you<00:03:21.340> can<00:03:21.519> see<00:03:21.640> here<00:03:21.850> so<00:03:22.000> you've

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.120 
platform as you can see here so you've

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:24.810 
platform as you can see here so you've
got<00:03:22.239> a<00:03:22.390> full<00:03:23.140> block<00:03:23.380> space<00:03:23.680> between<00:03:24.430> and<00:03:24.730> the

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:24.820 
got a full block space between and the

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:27.000 
got a full block space between and the

and put a half slab on the top half of

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.729 
and put a half slab on the top half of
the<00:03:33.400> block<00:03:33.580> that<00:03:33.820> is<00:03:34.269> a<00:03:34.540> space<00:03:35.019> out<00:03:35.230> there<00:03:35.380> have

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:35.739 
the block that is a space out there have

00:03:35.739 --> 00:03:37.110 
the block that is a space out there have
fun<00:03:35.890> explaining<00:03:36.250> this<00:03:36.430> all<00:03:36.580> right<00:03:36.700> you'll<00:03:36.910> see
