this<00:00:41.280> definitely<00:00:41.879> helped<00:00:42.239> with<00:00:42.329> traction

00:00:43.090 --> 00:00:43.100 
this definitely helped with traction

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.650 
this definitely helped with traction
there<00:00:44.100> was<00:00:44.190> no<00:00:44.370> loss<00:00:44.640> of<00:00:44.879> traction<00:00:45.149> which

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
there was no loss of traction which

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.150 
there was no loss of traction which
means<00:00:45.960> improved<00:00:46.500> speed<00:00:48.559> no<00:00:49.559> slippin<00:00:50.100> and

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 
means improved speed no slippin and

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.360 
means improved speed no slippin and
slidin<00:00:50.789> like<00:00:51.480> with<00:00:51.660> the<00:00:51.750> old<00:00:51.780> tires<00:00:52.370> and

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:38.540 
because the exhaust is plugged so I

00:05:38.540 --> 00:05:41.440
