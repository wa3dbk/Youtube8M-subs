00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.679 
hiking outdoor loving community now gene
is<00:00:18.300> a<00:00:18.330> pretty<00:00:18.720> standard<00:00:19.250> model<00:00:20.250> container

00:00:20.679 --> 00:00:20.689 
is a pretty standard model container

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:24.980 
is a pretty standard model container
it's<00:00:21.689> pretty<00:00:22.500> much<00:00:22.740> replaced<00:00:23.070> to<00:00:23.660> contain<00:00:24.660> in

it's pretty much replaced to contain in

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.080 
it's pretty much replaced to contain in
all<00:00:25.140> areas<00:00:25.650> totally<00:00:26.099> no<00:00:26.250> one<00:00:26.400> else<00:00:26.550> uses<00:00:26.910> a

all areas totally no one else uses a
canteen<00:00:27.630> anymore<00:00:28.080> i<00:00:28.289> think<00:00:29.099> it's<00:00:29.279> safe<00:00:29.429> to<00:00:29.460> say

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
canteen anymore i think it's safe to say

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.110 
canteen anymore i think it's safe to say
that<00:00:29.820> now<00:00:30.750> gene<00:00:31.080> is<00:00:31.289> the<00:00:31.470> standard<00:00:31.920> those<00:00:32.880> many

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120 
that now gene is the standard those many

priest<00:01:26.610> and<00:01:26.880> order<00:01:27.180> I<00:01:27.299> would<00:01:27.450> say<00:01:28.040> that<00:01:29.040> you

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:29.369 
priest and order I would say that you

00:01:29.369 --> 00:01:31.700 
priest and order I would say that you
can<00:01:29.640> pretty<00:01:29.850> much<00:01:29.939> rank<00:01:30.420> any<00:01:30.659> other<00:01:30.900> hydration

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
can pretty much rank any other hydration

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.310 
can pretty much rank any other hydration
contain<00:01:32.130> all<00:01:32.280> rather<00:01:32.759> it<00:01:33.000> be<00:01:33.180> battle<00:01:34.170> or

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:34.320 
contain all rather it be battle or

contain all rather it be battle or
Walston<00:01:34.829> than<00:01:34.950> the<00:01:35.040> nalgene<00:01:35.280> and<00:01:35.790> I'd<00:01:36.509> say

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
Walston than the nalgene and I'd say

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.770 
Walston than the nalgene and I'd say
there's<00:01:36.930> very<00:01:37.140> few<00:01:38.270> hydration<00:01:39.270> containers

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780 
there's very few hydration containers

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.660 
there's very few hydration containers
they'll<00:01:40.020> better<00:01:40.259> than<00:01:40.530> a<00:01:40.560> nalgene<00:01:41.400> in<00:01:41.549> my

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:41.670 
they'll better than a nalgene in my

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.240 
they'll better than a nalgene in my
opinion<00:01:42.030> some<00:01:43.020> of<00:01:43.170> them<00:01:43.259> have<00:01:43.500> specialty

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:44.250 
opinion some of them have specialty

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.630 
opinion some of them have specialty
features<00:01:45.210> that<00:01:45.689> the<00:01:46.020> now<00:01:46.799> gene<00:01:47.070> may<00:01:47.250> not<00:01:47.430> have

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
features that the now gene may not have

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.270 
features that the now gene may not have
but<00:01:48.030> this<00:01:48.180> is<00:01:48.390> a<00:01:48.420> good<00:01:48.689> all-around<00:01:49.280> hydration

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
but this is a good all-around hydration

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.310 
but this is a good all-around hydration
system<00:01:51.000> and<00:01:52.729> but<00:01:53.729> this<00:01:53.939> is<00:01:54.119> it<00:01:54.270> when<00:01:54.420> we<00:01:54.630> review

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:55.320 
system and but this is it when we review

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.950 
system and but this is it when we review
today<00:01:55.619> although<00:01:56.280> I<00:01:56.549> guess<00:01:56.729> I<00:01:57.000> just<00:01:57.030> did<00:01:57.420> a<00:01:57.450> mini

today although I guess I just did a mini

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.190 
today although I guess I just did a mini
review<00:01:58.409> over<00:01:58.740> it<00:01:59.210> the<00:02:00.210> rest<00:02:00.420> of<00:02:00.570> the<00:02:00.689> time<00:02:00.960> and

leak on me yet some of the advantages
that<00:02:35.390> the<00:02:35.690> Platypus<00:02:36.140> has<00:02:36.410> over<00:02:36.860> the<00:02:37.010> nalgene

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220 
that the Platypus has over the nalgene

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:41.229 
that the Platypus has over the nalgene
one<00:02:37.819> that<00:02:38.420> will<00:02:38.739> two<00:02:39.739> major<00:02:40.280> advantages<00:02:40.940> this

00:02:41.229 --> 00:02:41.239 
one that will two major advantages this

00:02:41.239 --> 00:02:43.600 
one that will two major advantages this
has<00:02:41.450> over<00:02:41.870> the<00:02:41.989> nalgene<00:02:42.200> is<00:02:42.620> one<00:02:42.830> it<00:02:43.070> saves<00:02:43.370> you

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:43.610 
has over the nalgene is one it saves you

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:46.479 
has over the nalgene is one it saves you
in<00:02:43.820> space<00:02:44.209> and<00:02:44.660> then<00:02:45.590> the<00:02:45.680> other<00:02:45.860> one<00:02:45.950> it<00:02:46.220> saves

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:46.489 
in space and then the other one it saves

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:48.640 
in space and then the other one it saves
you<00:02:46.700> and<00:02:46.850> wait<00:02:47.060> so<00:02:47.630> when<00:02:47.959> your<00:02:48.080> backpack<00:02:48.500> again

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:48.650 
you and wait so when your backpack again

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.610 
you and wait so when your backpack again
that's<00:02:49.220> pretty<00:02:49.730> much<00:02:49.880> the<00:02:49.940> two<00:02:50.260> major<00:02:51.260> factors

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:51.620 
that's pretty much the two major factors

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:53.140 
that's pretty much the two major factors
you<00:02:52.040> think<00:02:52.280> about<00:02:52.519> when<00:02:52.730> you're<00:02:52.820> making<00:02:53.120> your

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:53.150 
you think about when you're making your

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:57.040 
you think about when you're making your
backpack<00:02:53.660> and<00:02:53.690> kit<00:02:54.050> or<00:02:55.480> camping<00:02:56.480> kit<00:02:56.780> in<00:02:56.900> that

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:04.000 
metal unless you're driving to your
campsite<00:03:00.760> but<00:03:01.900> it<00:03:02.900> saves<00:03:03.230> you<00:03:03.500> and<00:03:03.739> wait

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.010 
campsite but it saves you and wait

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:07.479 
campsite but it saves you and wait
because<00:03:04.750> look<00:03:05.750> at<00:03:05.900> it<00:03:06.080> is<00:03:06.200> the<00:03:06.620> walls<00:03:06.860> are<00:03:07.190> so

00:03:07.479 --> 00:03:07.489 
because look at it is the walls are so

00:03:07.489 --> 00:03:10.059 
because look at it is the walls are so
thin<00:03:07.850> compared<00:03:08.600> to<00:03:08.780> the<00:03:08.930> now<00:03:09.080> Jean<00:03:09.380> is<00:03:09.650> this

00:03:10.059 --> 00:03:10.069 
thin compared to the now Jean is this

00:03:10.069 --> 00:03:12.940 
thin compared to the now Jean is this
more<00:03:10.310> flexible<00:03:10.910> it's<00:03:11.569> still<00:03:11.780> durable<00:03:12.440> the

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:12.950 
more flexible it's still durable the

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:17.170 
more flexible it's still durable the
dental<00:03:13.489> material<00:03:14.420> and<00:03:15.549> it<00:03:16.549> saves<00:03:16.910> you<00:03:17.090> in

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:17.180 
dental material and it saves you in

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:20.740 
dental material and it saves you in
space<00:03:17.480> because<00:03:17.810> once<00:03:18.650> this<00:03:18.829> is<00:03:19.040> empty<00:03:19.750> it's

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:20.750 
space because once this is empty it's

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:22.930 
space because once this is empty it's
still<00:03:21.019> that<00:03:21.290> shape<00:03:21.650> it<00:03:22.100> might<00:03:22.340> not<00:03:22.549> wait<00:03:22.760> as

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:22.940 
still that shape it might not wait as

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:24.610 
still that shape it might not wait as
much<00:03:23.180> but<00:03:23.690> it's<00:03:23.840> going<00:03:23.930> to<00:03:23.989> take<00:03:24.200> up<00:03:24.350> the<00:03:24.440> same

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:24.620 
much but it's going to take up the same

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:26.530 
much but it's going to take up the same
amount<00:03:24.769> of<00:03:24.980> space<00:03:25.220> when<00:03:25.790> it's<00:03:25.910> full<00:03:26.180> as<00:03:26.480> it

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
amount of space when it's full as it

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.380 
amount of space when it's full as it
does<00:03:27.110> when<00:03:27.440> it's<00:03:27.590> empty<00:03:27.829> this<00:03:28.670> after<00:03:29.239> you
