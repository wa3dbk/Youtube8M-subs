all<00:00:01.110> right<00:00:01.290> next<00:00:01.530> up<00:00:01.829> is<00:00:02.100> the<00:00:02.340> hand<00:00:02.669> wave<00:00:03.000> right

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:03.389 
all right next up is the hand wave right

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:05.930 
all right next up is the hand wave right
now<00:00:04.230> I<00:00:04.259> think<00:00:04.380> when<00:00:04.830> we<00:00:04.980> think<00:00:05.009> of<00:00:05.430> hand<00:00:05.670> waves

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:05.940 
now I think when we think of hand waves

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:08.390 
now I think when we think of hand waves
we<00:00:06.270> all<00:00:06.390> think<00:00:06.629> of<00:00:06.779> the<00:00:06.899> same<00:00:07.109> person<00:00:07.410> pac-man

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:08.400 
we all think of the same person pac-man

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.470 
we all think of the same person pac-man
pac-man<00:00:09.559> Phillip<00:00:10.559> shebib<00:00:11.070> the<00:00:11.580> boys<00:00:11.849> got<00:00:12.150> some

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:12.480 
pac-man Phillip shebib the boys got some

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.250 
pac-man Phillip shebib the boys got some
sick<00:00:12.960> hand<00:00:13.650> waves<00:00:14.009> it's<00:00:14.429> crazy<00:00:14.940> how<00:00:15.420> fluid<00:00:16.049> his

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:16.260 
sick hand waves it's crazy how fluid his

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:17.990 
sick hand waves it's crazy how fluid his
hand<00:00:16.500> waves<00:00:16.740> are<00:00:16.920> I'm<00:00:17.070> not<00:00:17.250> gonna<00:00:17.430> front<00:00:17.760> man

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:18.000 
hand waves are I'm not gonna front man

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.640 
hand waves are I'm not gonna front man
that<00:00:18.270> guy<00:00:18.830> props<00:00:19.830> to<00:00:20.130> him<00:00:20.670> alright<00:00:21.480> so<00:00:22.109> the

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:22.650 
that guy props to him alright so the

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.790 
that guy props to him alright so the
hand<00:00:22.920> wave<00:00:23.250> kind<00:00:24.240> of<00:00:24.420> just<00:00:24.720> looks<00:00:25.230> like<00:00:25.500> this

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:25.800 
hand wave kind of just looks like this

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.400 
hand wave kind of just looks like this
right<00:00:26.189> and<00:00:26.400> the<00:00:27.119> more<00:00:27.359> fluids<00:00:28.140> you<00:00:28.320> get<00:00:28.560> it<00:00:30.410> the

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:31.410 
right and the more fluids you get it the

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:35.810 
right and the more fluids you get it the
better<00:00:33.500> so<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:34.620> hand<00:00:34.829> wave<00:00:35.010> consists<00:00:35.700> of

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
better so the hand wave consists of

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:38.690 
better so the hand wave consists of
three<00:00:36.360> movements<00:00:37.010> right<00:00:38.010> if<00:00:38.250> your<00:00:38.399> hand<00:00:38.579> is

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
three movements right if your hand is

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:43.819 
three movements right if your hand is
flat<00:00:39.090> it<00:00:40.050> involves<00:00:40.739> bending<00:00:41.750> at<00:00:42.829> these

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
flat it involves bending at these

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:51.459 
flat it involves bending at these
knuckles<00:00:44.460> right<00:00:45.860> like<00:00:46.860> that<00:00:47.539> then<00:00:48.539> bending<00:00:49.140> at

00:00:51.459 --> 00:00:51.469 
knuckles right like that then bending at

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:57.680 
knuckles right like that then bending at
these<00:00:52.489> knuckles<00:00:53.960> then<00:00:55.789> bending<00:00:56.789> at<00:00:57.120> the<00:00:57.360> wrist

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
these knuckles then bending at the wrist

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.860 
these knuckles then bending at the wrist
and<00:00:58.079> when<00:00:58.890> you<00:00:58.980> bend<00:00:59.280> it<00:00:59.430> the<00:00:59.550> wrist<00:00:59.870> generally

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
and when you bend it the wrist generally

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.979 
and when you bend it the wrist generally
speaking<00:01:01.109> what<00:01:01.620> you<00:01:01.770> want<00:01:01.980> to<00:01:02.100> do<00:01:02.309> is<00:01:02.989> push

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:03.989 
speaking what you want to do is push

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.530 
speaking what you want to do is push
down<00:01:04.379> on<00:01:04.409> this<00:01:04.890> knuckle<00:01:05.400> so<00:01:05.850> that<00:01:06.000> the<00:01:06.119> fingers

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
down on this knuckle so that the fingers

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:09.469 
down on this knuckle so that the fingers
come<00:01:06.869> up<00:01:07.049> the<00:01:07.290> reason<00:01:07.680> for<00:01:07.950> that<00:01:07.979> is<00:01:08.340> it<00:01:09.119> create

00:01:09.469 --> 00:01:09.479 
come up the reason for that is it create

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:12.200 
come up the reason for that is it create
your<00:01:09.659> back<00:01:09.960> to<00:01:10.290> where<00:01:10.470> you<00:01:10.650> started<00:01:10.680> now<00:01:11.430> see

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
your back to where you started now see

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.359 
your back to where you started now see
that<00:01:12.420> it<00:01:12.659> creates<00:01:13.290> a<00:01:13.500> loop<00:01:13.740> you<00:01:13.950> know<00:01:13.979> how<00:01:14.159> like

00:01:14.359 --> 00:01:14.369 
that it creates a loop you know how like

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:16.789 
that it creates a loop you know how like
sometimes<00:01:14.580> you<00:01:14.939> see<00:01:15.150> a<00:01:15.390> dope<00:01:15.659> video<00:01:15.900> and<00:01:16.350> it's

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
sometimes you see a dope video and it's

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:21.289 
sometimes you see a dope video and it's
got<00:01:17.040> a<00:01:17.250> loop<00:01:17.610> of<00:01:17.909> a<00:01:18.090> guy<00:01:18.240> just<00:01:18.540> walking<00:01:20.299> it's

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
got a loop of a guy just walking it's

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.480 
got a loop of a guy just walking it's
just<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.659> same<00:01:21.900> loop<00:01:22.259> over<00:01:22.770> and<00:01:22.920> over<00:01:23.070> of<00:01:23.340> the

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
just the same loop over and over of the

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.609 
just the same loop over and over of the
guy<00:01:23.610> walking<00:01:23.970> it's<00:01:24.630> the<00:01:24.900> same<00:01:25.170> thing<00:01:25.200> with

00:01:25.609 --> 00:01:25.619 
guy walking it's the same thing with

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.429 
guy walking it's the same thing with
this<00:01:25.770> hand<00:01:26.040> wave<00:01:26.250> it's<00:01:27.030> a<00:01:27.210> loop<00:01:27.479> so<00:01:28.229> if<00:01:28.320> you

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:28.439 
this hand wave it's a loop so if you

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.969 
this hand wave it's a loop so if you
start<00:01:28.770> here<00:01:29.340> and<00:01:29.490> you<00:01:30.000> bend<00:01:30.420> and<00:01:30.750> then<00:01:31.740> you

00:01:31.969 --> 00:01:31.979 
start here and you bend and then you

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.039 
start here and you bend and then you
bend<00:01:32.280> and<00:01:32.640> then<00:01:32.759> you<00:01:32.850> bend<00:01:33.180> you're<00:01:33.750> basically

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
bend and then you bend you're basically

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:41.820 
bend and then you bend you're basically
back<00:01:34.680> to<00:01:35.130> square<00:01:35.970> one<00:01:36.210> again

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:41.830 

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:44.370 

see<00:01:42.830> how<00:01:42.920> that<00:01:43.010> kind<00:01:43.310> of<00:01:43.430> looks<00:01:43.640> like<00:01:43.700> a<00:01:43.820> loop

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:44.380 
see how that kind of looks like a loop

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:47.800 
see how that kind of looks like a loop
then<00:01:45.380> you<00:01:45.560> speed<00:01:46.010> it<00:01:46.160> up<00:01:46.310> and<00:01:46.700> flow<00:01:47.060> it<00:01:47.270> up<00:01:47.390> now

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:47.810 
then you speed it up and flow it up now

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.410 
then you speed it up and flow it up now
I<00:01:47.840> want<00:01:48.080> to<00:01:48.140> tell<00:01:48.350> you<00:01:48.560> that<00:01:49.420> generally

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
I want to tell you that generally

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.430 
I want to tell you that generally
speaking<00:01:51.460> your<00:01:52.460> hands<00:01:52.910> are<00:01:53.030> pretty<00:01:53.180> tense<00:01:53.720> my

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:54.440 
speaking your hands are pretty tense my

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:58.780 
speaking your hands are pretty tense my
hands<00:01:54.920> right<00:01:55.100> now<00:01:55.160> are<00:01:56.800> flexed<00:01:57.800> see<00:01:58.190> that<00:01:58.400> see

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:58.790 
hands right now are flexed see that see

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:02.290 
hands right now are flexed see that see
the<00:01:58.940> little<00:01:58.970> webbing<00:01:59.840> right<00:02:00.050> there<00:02:01.300> it's

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:02.300 
the little webbing right there it's

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:07.060 
the little webbing right there it's
tense<00:02:03.490> the<00:02:04.490> tension<00:02:05.090> allows<00:02:05.390> you<00:02:05.810> to<00:02:06.170> bend

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:07.070 
tense the tension allows you to bend

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.270 
tense the tension allows you to bend
more<00:02:07.610> and<00:02:08.410> exaggerate<00:02:09.410> the<00:02:09.590> movement<00:02:10.009> more<00:02:10.100> so

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:10.280 
more and exaggerate the movement more so

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.090 
more and exaggerate the movement more so
let's<00:02:10.460> go<00:02:10.640> over<00:02:10.670> it<00:02:10.880> again<00:02:11.470> you<00:02:12.470> bend<00:02:12.740> it<00:02:12.920> at

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
let's go over it again you bend it at

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.300 
let's go over it again you bend it at
these<00:02:13.760> knuckles<00:02:14.480> these<00:02:14.959> knuckles<00:02:15.650> and<00:02:16.010> then

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.310 
these knuckles these knuckles and then

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.650 
these knuckles these knuckles and then
the<00:02:16.490> wrist<00:02:16.730> one<00:02:17.600> two<00:02:18.500> three<00:02:18.980> and<00:02:19.610> then<00:02:19.970> one<00:02:20.300> two

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
the wrist one two three and then one two

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.510 
the wrist one two three and then one two
three<00:02:20.990> you<00:02:21.140> just<00:02:21.320> you<00:02:21.680> just<00:02:21.709> repeat<00:02:22.280> it<00:02:22.310> over

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:22.520 
three you just you just repeat it over

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:28.480 
three you just you just repeat it over
and<00:02:22.700> over<00:02:23.140> right<00:02:24.520> so<00:02:25.520> one<00:02:26.000> two<00:02:26.600> three<00:02:27.459> one<00:02:28.459> two

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:28.490 
and over right so one two three one two

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:34.770 
and over right so one two three one two
three<00:02:28.820> one<00:02:29.510> two<00:02:29.720> three<00:02:29.990> one<00:02:30.560> two<00:02:30.709> three<00:02:33.670> and

three one two three one two three and

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:40.140 
three one two three one two three and
then<00:02:35.780> you<00:02:35.810> can<00:02:36.110> come<00:02:36.350> out<00:02:36.530> the<00:02:36.800> same<00:02:37.010> way<00:02:37.070> right

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:52.360

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:52.370 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:56.030 

and<00:02:53.540> you<00:02:54.540> can<00:02:54.750> let<00:02:54.900> your<00:02:55.110> wrist<00:02:55.410> go<00:02:55.650> so<00:02:55.890> it's

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
and you can let your wrist go so it's

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.280 
and you can let your wrist go so it's
not<00:02:56.160> just<00:02:56.220> this<00:02:56.970> you<00:02:57.480> can<00:02:57.660> get<00:02:57.810> your<00:02:58.019> wrist

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
not just this you can get your wrist

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:05.119 
not just this you can get your wrist
into<00:02:58.739> it<00:02:58.860> so<00:02:59.129> 1<00:02:59.849> 2<00:03:00.420> 3<00:03:00.720> 4<00:03:00.930> really<00:03:01.940> 1234<00:03:02.940> 1234<00:03:04.129> but

00:03:05.119 --> 00:03:05.129 
into it so 1 2 3 4 really 1234 1234 but

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:08.000 
into it so 1 2 3 4 really 1234 1234 but
if<00:03:05.220> you're<00:03:05.400> doing<00:03:05.670> an<00:03:05.819> arm<00:03:06.090> wave<00:03:06.800> it's<00:03:07.800> going

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
if you're doing an arm wave it's going

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.240 
if you're doing an arm wave it's going
to<00:03:08.040> be<00:03:08.310> you<00:03:08.819> know<00:03:08.940> one<00:03:09.269> two<00:03:09.750> three<00:03:10.410> four<00:03:10.860> five

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
to be you know one two three four five

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:20.150 
to be you know one two three four five
six<00:03:16.580> see<00:03:17.580> this<00:03:17.730> is<00:03:17.940> how<00:03:18.120> it<00:03:18.330> looks<00:03:18.860> this<00:03:19.860> is<00:03:20.040> how

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:20.160 
six see this is how it looks this is how

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:43.430 
six see this is how it looks this is how
it<00:03:20.340> looks<00:03:20.370> going<00:03:20.910> in<00:03:25.640> and<00:03:26.640> on<00:03:27.420> this<00:03:27.450> side<00:03:42.440> and

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:43.440 
it looks going in and on this side and

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.410 
it looks going in and on this side and
you<00:03:43.769> can<00:03:43.980> just<00:03:44.280> you<00:03:44.489> hand<00:03:44.760> weights<00:03:45.000> you<00:03:45.239> can

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
you can just you hand weights you can

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.600 
you can just you hand weights you can
also<00:03:45.599> do<00:03:45.930> the<00:03:46.079> hand<00:03:46.319> wave<00:03:46.560> like<00:03:46.799> this<00:03:46.860> right

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:47.610 
also do the hand wave like this right

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:50.050 
also do the hand wave like this right
that's<00:03:48.540> probably<00:03:49.049> one<00:03:49.379> of<00:03:49.410> the<00:03:49.680> coolest

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
that's probably one of the coolest

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:52.520 
that's probably one of the coolest
applications<00:03:51.060> of<00:03:51.269> the<00:03:51.360> handless<00:03:51.780> because<00:03:52.410> it

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:52.530 
applications of the handless because it

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.979 
applications of the handless because it
enables<00:03:53.040> you<00:03:53.190> to<00:03:53.220> a<00:03:53.370> way<00:03:53.730> where<00:03:54.030> you<00:03:54.180> where<00:03:54.959> you

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
enables you to a way where you where you

00:03:54.989 --> 00:04:12.820 
enables you to a way where you where you
stay<00:03:55.470> still<00:04:02.569> to<00:04:03.569> get<00:04:03.750> a<00:04:03.870> hug

00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:12.830 

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:15.380 

and<00:04:13.830> you<00:04:13.980> can<00:04:14.160> change<00:04:14.430> levels<00:04:14.790> we'll<00:04:15.180> get<00:04:15.330> to

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:15.390 
and you can change levels we'll get to

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:17.930 
and you can change levels we'll get to
that<00:04:15.570> link<00:04:15.960> but<00:04:16.320> let's<00:04:17.040> get<00:04:17.220> back<00:04:17.280> to<00:04:17.609> the<00:04:17.700> hand

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:17.940 
that link but let's get back to the hand

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:19.460 
that link but let's get back to the hand
wave<00:04:18.120> let's<00:04:18.299> do<00:04:18.420> on<00:04:18.540> the<00:04:18.660> right<00:04:18.870> now<00:04:19.079> because

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
wave let's do on the right now because

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:21.349 
wave let's do on the right now because
it's<00:04:19.650> crucially<00:04:20.400> important<00:04:20.850> to<00:04:20.940> learn<00:04:21.090> things

00:04:21.349 --> 00:04:21.359 
it's crucially important to learn things

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:25.430 
it's crucially important to learn things
on<00:04:21.510> both<00:04:21.720> sides<00:04:22.100> so<00:04:23.570> again<00:04:24.570> you<00:04:24.810> start<00:04:25.020> one

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:25.440 
on both sides so again you start one

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:29.360 
on both sides so again you start one
with<00:04:26.190> these<00:04:26.430> nuts<00:04:26.850> with<00:04:27.380> these<00:04:28.380> knuckles<00:04:28.980> then

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:29.370 
with these nuts with these knuckles then

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:31.370 
with these nuts with these knuckles then
these<00:04:29.910> knuckles<00:04:30.450> that<00:04:30.690> needs<00:04:30.930> new<00:04:31.140> clothes

00:04:31.370 --> 00:04:31.380 
these knuckles that needs new clothes

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:35.930 
these knuckles that needs new clothes
right<00:04:31.560> so<00:04:31.890> one<00:04:32.670> two<00:04:33.450> three<00:04:34.320> and<00:04:34.940> you're

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:35.940 
right so one two three and you're

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:39.680 
right so one two three and you're
bending<00:04:36.270> remember<00:04:37.490> so<00:04:38.490> up<00:04:38.940> as<00:04:39.330> high<00:04:39.480> as<00:04:39.510> you

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:39.690 
bending remember so up as high as you

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:41.360 
bending remember so up as high as you
can<00:04:39.780> one<00:04:40.170> of<00:04:40.290> the<00:04:40.380> things<00:04:40.530> that<00:04:40.650> pac-man<00:04:41.100> is

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.370 
can one of the things that pac-man is

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:44.150 
can one of the things that pac-man is
really<00:04:41.880> good<00:04:42.090> at<00:04:42.240> is<00:04:42.420> he's<00:04:42.620> super<00:04:43.620> flexible

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:44.160 
really good at is he's super flexible

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.000 
really good at is he's super flexible
here<00:04:44.550> so<00:04:45.090> he<00:04:45.270> can<00:04:45.420> really<00:04:45.810> bend<00:04:46.380> that<00:04:46.620> shape

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:47.010 
here so he can really bend that shape

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:52.250 
here so he can really bend that shape
very<00:04:47.550> very<00:04:47.850> well<00:04:48.090> okay<00:04:48.900> so<00:04:49.200> one<00:04:49.980> two<00:04:50.370> three<00:04:51.260> one

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:52.260 
very very well okay so one two three one

00:04:52.260 --> 00:05:03.980 
very very well okay so one two three one
two<00:04:52.290> three<00:04:52.620> one<00:04:53.310> two<00:04:53.490> three

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:03.990 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:07.200 

so<00:05:04.990> this<00:05:05.200> comes<00:05:05.770> in<00:05:05.950> handy<00:05:05.980> so<00:05:06.640> many<00:05:06.910> ways<00:05:07.180> you

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:07.210 
so this comes in handy so many ways you

00:05:07.210 --> 00:05:10.890 
so this comes in handy so many ways you
can<00:05:07.690> do<00:05:07.840> it<00:05:07.960> for<00:05:08.260> so<00:05:08.560> many<00:05:08.770> things<00:05:09.220> you<00:05:09.370> can<00:05:09.900> you

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:10.900 
can do it for so many things you can you

can do it for so many things you can you
can<00:05:11.140> just<00:05:12.040> do<00:05:12.310> hand<00:05:12.730> waves<00:05:13.000> you<00:05:13.780> can<00:05:14.050> hand<00:05:14.650> wave

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:14.920 
can just do hand waves you can hand wave

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:18.450 
can just do hand waves you can hand wave
into<00:05:15.310> your<00:05:15.460> chest<00:05:15.870> to<00:05:16.870> make<00:05:17.110> your<00:05:17.740> chest<00:05:18.070> sink

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:22.090 
back you can wave into things and then

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:24.870 
back you can wave into things and then
wave<00:05:22.420> out<00:05:22.690> of<00:05:22.990> them<00:05:23.200> right<00:05:23.440> that<00:05:24.430> looks<00:05:24.640> like
