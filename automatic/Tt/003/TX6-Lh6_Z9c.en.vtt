00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:06.720 
something I actually had to look up

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.070 
something I actually had to look up
that's<00:00:07.259> how<00:00:07.500> to<00:00:07.560> white<00:00:07.890> balance<00:00:08.069> a<00:00:08.370> Canon<00:00:08.880> DSLR

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:09.080

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:22.860 

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:25.580 

so<00:00:23.640> here<00:00:23.820> I<00:00:23.880> am<00:00:23.970> on<00:00:24.180> the<00:00:24.360> Canon<00:00:24.780> t3i<00:00:24.810> right<00:00:25.440> now

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
so here I am on the Canon t3i right now

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.769 
so here I am on the Canon t3i right now
nothing<00:00:26.250> too<00:00:26.369> fancy<00:00:26.520> just<00:00:26.910> on<00:00:27.029> the<00:00:27.210> movie<00:00:27.570> mode

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:29.400 
and first way to figure out how to

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.670 
and first way to figure out how to
actually<00:00:29.610> access<00:00:29.970> all<00:00:30.420> the<00:00:30.540> presets<00:00:31.020> for<00:00:31.590> the

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.540 
presets
there's<00:00:39.720> Auto<00:00:40.110> which<00:00:40.500> auto<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:41.250> camera<00:00:41.489> I'll

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
there's Auto which auto the camera I'll

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.009 
there's Auto which auto the camera I'll
try<00:00:41.670> to<00:00:41.730> figure<00:00:41.970> out<00:00:42.210> what<00:00:42.330> the<00:00:42.420> white<00:00:42.660> balance

00:00:43.009 --> 00:00:43.019 
try to figure out what the white balance

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:45.290 
try to figure out what the white balance
is<00:00:43.140> and<00:00:43.470> set<00:00:43.769> it<00:00:43.949> but<00:00:44.400> also<00:00:44.519> as<00:00:44.730> other<00:00:44.879> presets

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
is and set it but also as other presets

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.229 
is and set it but also as other presets
for<00:00:45.420> like<00:00:45.570> daylight<00:00:46.019> shade<00:00:46.620> cloudy<00:00:47.489> and<00:00:47.910> tons

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
for like daylight shade cloudy and tons

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.750 
for like daylight shade cloudy and tons
of<00:00:48.360> stuff<00:00:48.540> that<00:00:48.840> I<00:00:48.870> don't<00:00:49.470> use<00:00:49.710> because<00:00:50.040> I<00:00:50.280> hate

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
of stuff that I don't use because I hate

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:52.430 
of stuff that I don't use because I hate
all<00:00:50.970> the<00:00:51.090> white<00:00:51.239> balance<00:00:51.390> presets<00:00:51.960> so<00:00:52.410> I

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
all the white balance presets so I

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.890 
all the white balance presets so I
always<00:00:52.739> use<00:00:52.860> the<00:00:53.220> last<00:00:53.580> one<00:00:53.879> which<00:00:54.360> is<00:00:54.390> custom

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:54.900 
always use the last one which is custom

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.110 
always use the last one which is custom
so<00:00:55.440> once<00:00:55.710> you<00:00:55.830> set<00:00:56.040> that<00:00:56.250> you<00:00:56.400> can<00:00:56.519> now<00:00:56.670> have<00:00:56.699> a

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
so once you set that you can now have a

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.390 
so once you set that you can now have a
custom<00:00:57.600> white<00:00:57.780> balance<00:00:57.890> but<00:00:58.890> if<00:00:59.070> you<00:00:59.250> want

00:00:59.390 --> 00:00:59.400 
custom white balance but if you want

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:00.890 
custom white balance but if you want
actually<00:00:59.670> want<00:00:59.879> to<00:00:59.940> set<00:01:00.269> a<00:01:00.390> white<00:01:00.570> balance

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:00.900 
actually want to set a white balance

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:02.600 
actually want to set a white balance
