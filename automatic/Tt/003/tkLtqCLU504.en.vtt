the buick regal is fun in the corners
this<00:02:02.080> isn't<00:02:02.650> exactly<00:02:02.800> all<00:02:03.369> about<00:02:03.580> that<00:02:03.820> it's

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.000 
this isn't exactly all about that it's

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.880 
this isn't exactly all about that it's
not<00:02:04.119> a<00:02:04.180> handler<00:02:04.630> and<00:02:04.869> that's<00:02:05.409> because<00:02:05.560> it's

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:05.890 
not a handler and that's because it's

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:08.040 
not a handler and that's because it's
not<00:02:06.010> meant<00:02:06.220> to<00:02:06.280> be<00:02:06.340> one<00:02:06.729> it's<00:02:07.150> really<00:02:07.540> just<00:02:07.690> a

easier to say anyway with a 240-volt
jack<00:02:49.900> it<00:02:50.080> will<00:02:50.170> take<00:02:50.320> for<00:02:50.500> 515<00:02:51.250> p.m.<00:02:51.610> now<00:02:51.910> if

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:52.450 
jack it will take for 515 p.m. now if

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:54.240 
jack it will take for 515 p.m. now if
you<00:02:52.570> want<00:02:52.750> to<00:02:52.780> change<00:02:53.050> the<00:02:53.230> charging<00:02:53.709> mode<00:02:53.830> you

00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.250 
you want to change the charging mode you

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:55.860 
you want to change the charging mode you
can<00:02:54.310> have<00:02:54.519> it<00:02:54.670> as<00:02:54.820> we<00:02:54.970> have<00:02:55.060> it<00:02:55.150> set<00:02:55.299> now<00:02:55.540> so

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
can have it as we have it set now so

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:57.300 
can have it as we have it set now so
when<00:02:56.230> you<00:02:56.320> immediately<00:02:56.620> plug<00:02:56.860> it<00:02:56.980> in<00:02:57.070> and<00:02:57.190> just

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
when you immediately plug it in and just

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.370 
when you immediately plug it in and just
charge<00:02:57.580> it<00:02:57.700> right<00:02:57.850> away<00:02:57.970> you<00:02:58.690> can<00:02:58.810> also<00:02:58.930> set<00:02:59.260> it

00:02:59.370 --> 00:02:59.380 
charge it right away you can also set it

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:00.990 
charge it right away you can also set it
so<00:02:59.590> you<00:02:59.980> can<00:03:00.130> delay<00:03:00.459> it<00:03:00.489> based<00:03:00.790> on<00:03:00.910> your

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:01.000 
so you can delay it based on your

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.340 
so you can delay it based on your
departure<00:03:01.269> time<00:03:01.570> so<00:03:01.750> if<00:03:01.840> you<00:03:01.930> come<00:03:02.110> home<00:03:02.230> from
