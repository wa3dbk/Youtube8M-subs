00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
 Hello and welcome to 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:05.549
 weather at wetter.net 

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.690
 yes if you are in saarland today 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:08.250
 Rhineland Palatinate in Hesse 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.170
 North Rhine-Westphalia or Baden 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.580
 work or are on the way 

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.500
 then just do not forget theirs 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.000
 gloves or these 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.440
 small handfeger if you because 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.270
 park your car outside 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:19.350
 in the course of the day, the strong pull 

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:21.330
 snowfall on and they can 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.230
 in places 10 to 20 centimeters 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.300
 bring new snow 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.580
 and there must be one tonight 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.180
 or others free their car for the first time 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.640
 sweep 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.410
 that sounds pretty much gone first 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.329
 easier with moderating this too 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.680
 gloves let's say there are 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.210
 on a private news channel 

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.200
 Some ladies like to moderate in 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.870
 scarf and gloves 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.340
 but I will spare that and yes here 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.469
 from west comes our deep xaver 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.250
 the deep xaver is ours 

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:46.410
 bring snow 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:48.300
 and this snowfall is now off 

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.670
 saarland overran palatine hessen 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.350
 to Saxony and Thuringia over and 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.840
 at temperatures around zero respectively 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.610
 to -2 degrees of snow also remains 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.500
 lie immediately and that means on the 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.539
 Roads can become dangerously smooth 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.070
 in the evening we also expect above all 

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.719
 get involved here in the rhine main area 

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:05.400
 real traffic chaos if then the 

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:07.860
 Feierabendverkehr first used 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.600
 has and at the airport rhein-main there 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:11.580
 we expect massive disabilities today 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.080
 in the south, on the other hand, almost 

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.450
 spring mood at temperatures up to 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.890
 twelve degrees change sun and clouds and 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.290
 every now and then a few showers 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.479
 sunshine is the topic in the north and 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.400
 east at minus 2 to 0 degrees seems 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:25.170
 often the sun and there is really 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.880
 a nice day at which one this 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.530
 beautiful winter landscape can enjoy 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:30.750
 Incidentally, it was still very much this morning 

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:32.640
 cold in quickborn in northern germany 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.270
 For example, we have minus 18 degrees 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.189
 measured 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:36.329
 We will also be in this minus 18 degrees 

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:38.040
 the next night in the north again 

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.110
 but otherwise it will reach 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.420
 everywhere frost is the exception 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:44.369
 alpenrand there can still 0 to plus one 

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.530
 But even here it will not work 

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.000
 There will be some snowfall else 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:49.020
 in the middle many clouds and still 

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.700
 more snowfalls 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:52.860
 but they let the morning slowly 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:55.020
 after and the days to come 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.909
 then wet cold prevail over and over again 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.159
 There are individual snowfalls or too 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:00.930
 snow showers and temperatures are rising 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:02.189
 slow and reach in the west on 

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.170
 friday plus four degrees 

00:02:02.189 --> 00:02:05.520
 on friday there are in the west and in the 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.680
 north again increased sunshine 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.140
 and the trend direction weekend the 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.989
 Temperatures could climb up again 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.470
 values ​​around 8 to 10 degrees in the west but in the 

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:15.690
 east 

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.400
 there is still relatively cool yes 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:19.350
 the spring probably will not 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.360
 return pass through before easter 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.740
 Nevertheless, they make the best of it and 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.330
 drive in front of all things today in the 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:26.970
 slowly it can be on the 

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:29.720
 It must be very slippery roads 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:29.720
 Ok, see you tomorrow
