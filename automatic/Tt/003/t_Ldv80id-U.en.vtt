product development for this thing we
were<00:00:47.800> like<00:00:47.949> we<00:00:48.070> realized<00:00:48.370> that<00:00:48.460> we<00:00:48.550> have<00:00:48.789> the

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:48.909 
were like we realized that we have the

00:00:48.909 --> 00:00:51.329 
were like we realized that we have the
sanctity<00:00:49.390> of<00:00:49.420> like<00:00:49.780> you<00:00:50.109> know<00:00:50.159> casual<00:00:51.159> party

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:51.339 
sanctity of like you know casual party

00:00:51.339 --> 00:00:52.680 
sanctity of like you know casual party
gameplay<00:00:51.940> and<00:00:52.149> that's<00:00:52.269> the<00:00:52.420> thing<00:00:52.539> that's

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:52.690 
gameplay and that's the thing that's

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:54.329 
gameplay and that's the thing that's
really<00:00:52.870> put<00:00:53.230> music<00:00:53.350> games<00:00:53.739> on<00:00:53.920> the<00:00:54.010> forefront

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:54.339 
really put music games on the forefront

00:00:54.339 --> 00:00:55.590 
really put music games on the forefront
so<00:00:54.640> we<00:00:54.760> realized<00:00:55.059> that<00:00:55.089> we<00:00:55.179> you<00:00:55.420> know<00:00:55.480> we

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:55.600 
so we realized that we you know we

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:57.569 
so we realized that we you know we
didn't<00:00:55.780> want<00:00:55.929> to<00:00:55.989> really<00:00:56.249> tinker<00:00:57.249> with<00:00:57.370> that

00:00:57.569 --> 00:00:57.579 
didn't want to really tinker with that

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:00.360 
didn't want to really tinker with that
too<00:00:57.789> much<00:00:57.969> and<00:00:58.239> so<00:00:58.359> we<00:00:58.800> revised<00:00:59.800> the<00:01:00.039> tour

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:00.370 
too much and so we revised the tour

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.450 
too much and so we revised the tour
we've<00:01:01.120> given<00:01:01.569> a<00:01:01.960> new<00:01:02.440> face<00:01:02.710> to<00:01:03.010> sort<00:01:03.249> of<00:01:03.339> the

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:03.460 
we've given a new face to sort of the

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.210 
we've given a new face to sort of the
rock<00:01:03.699> band<00:01:03.969> 2<00:01:04.449> world<00:01:04.960> tour<00:01:05.350> where<00:01:05.770> you<00:01:06.100> know

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:06.220 
rock band 2 world tour where you know

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.540 
rock band 2 world tour where you know
it's<00:01:06.760> more<00:01:06.970> of<00:01:07.060> a<00:01:07.120> career<00:01:07.450> progression<00:01:08.550> I'll

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:09.550 
it's more of a career progression I'll

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:11.249 
it's more of a career progression I'll
talk<00:01:09.760> about<00:01:10.030> the<00:01:10.450> both<00:01:10.630> of<00:01:10.810> these<00:01:10.900> separately

00:01:11.249 --> 00:01:11.259 
talk about the both of these separately

00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:14.249 
talk about the both of these separately
I<00:01:11.469> guess<00:01:11.710> so<00:01:11.979> tour<00:01:12.729> you<00:01:13.600> know<00:01:13.630> we<00:01:13.840> really<00:01:13.869> view

00:01:14.249 --> 00:01:14.259 
I guess so tour you know we really view

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:16.560 
I guess so tour you know we really view
is<00:01:14.409> more<00:01:14.619> of<00:01:14.710> like<00:01:14.740> a<00:01:14.890> most<00:01:15.759> a<00:01:15.850> quick<00:01:16.030> play<00:01:16.240> mode

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:16.570 
is more of like a most a quick play mode

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.130 
is more of like a most a quick play mode
where<00:01:16.990> you<00:01:18.210> know<00:01:19.210> it's<00:01:19.360> not<00:01:19.479> just<00:01:19.540> choosing

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:20.140 
where you know it's not just choosing

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:21.780 
where you know it's not just choosing
random<00:01:20.439> songs<00:01:20.710> there's<00:01:21.100> an<00:01:21.250> element<00:01:21.460> of

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:21.790 
random songs there's an element of

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:24.539 
random songs there's an element of
gameplay<00:01:22.689> and<00:01:22.899> strategy<00:01:23.409> and<00:01:23.649> also<00:01:23.920> you<00:01:24.430> know

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:24.549 
gameplay and strategy and also you know

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:25.709 
gameplay and strategy and also you know
the<00:01:24.670> most<00:01:24.789> important<00:01:25.240> thing<00:01:25.329> is<00:01:25.420> it's<00:01:25.570> got<00:01:25.689> a

00:01:25.709 --> 00:01:25.719 
the most important thing is it's got a

00:01:25.719 --> 00:01:27.929 
the most important thing is it's got a
finite<00:01:26.170> end<00:01:26.409> to<00:01:26.619> it<00:01:26.740> so<00:01:26.920> each<00:01:27.070> tour<00:01:27.430> is<00:01:27.670> really

00:01:27.929 --> 00:01:27.939 
finite end to it so each tour is really

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:30.270 
finite end to it so each tour is really
designed<00:01:28.090> to<00:01:28.360> be<00:01:28.479> completed<00:01:28.840> in<00:01:29.049> a<00:01:29.229> chunk<00:01:30.189> of

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:30.280 
designed to be completed in a chunk of

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:31.560 
designed to be completed in a chunk of
time<00:01:30.490> you<00:01:30.789> know<00:01:30.820> and<00:01:30.909> that<00:01:31.090> could<00:01:31.210> be<00:01:31.240> a<00:01:31.329> half

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:31.570 
time you know and that could be a half

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:33.840 
time you know and that could be a half
an<00:01:31.689> hour<00:01:31.840> or<00:01:32.140> it<00:01:32.259> could<00:01:32.380> be<00:01:32.409> a<00:01:32.799> couple<00:01:33.340> of<00:01:33.549> hours

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:33.850 
an hour or it could be a couple of hours

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:35.490 
an hour or it could be a couple of hours
but<00:01:34.000> the<00:01:34.149> idea<00:01:34.420> is<00:01:34.479> it's<00:01:34.780> not<00:01:34.899> just<00:01:34.960> sort<00:01:35.439> of

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:35.500 
but the idea is it's not just sort of

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.429 
but the idea is it's not just sort of
preformed<00:01:36.210> gameplay<00:01:37.210> its<00:01:37.450> social<00:01:37.930> game<00:01:38.140> play

00:01:38.429 --> 00:01:38.439 
preformed gameplay its social game play

00:01:38.439 --> 00:01:40.740 
preformed gameplay its social game play
with<00:01:38.829> a<00:01:39.159> wrapper<00:01:39.850> around<00:01:40.030> its<00:01:40.570> some

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750 
with a wrapper around its some

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.590 
with a wrapper around its some
organization<00:01:41.710> some<00:01:42.189> you<00:01:42.460> know<00:01:42.490> basically<00:01:43.299> a

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:43.600 
organization some you know basically a

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.539 
organization some you know basically a
little<00:01:43.840> structure<00:01:44.170> when<00:01:44.950> these<00:01:45.100> are<00:01:45.280> these

00:01:45.539 --> 00:01:45.549 
little structure when these are these

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:47.490 
little structure when these are these
are<00:01:45.609> interactive<00:01:46.420> like<00:01:46.719> it's<00:01:46.960> like<00:01:47.350> you're

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:47.500 
are interactive like it's like you're

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:49.050 
are interactive like it's like you're
you're<00:01:47.859> hanging<00:01:48.250> with<00:01:48.340> your<00:01:48.460> people<00:01:48.789> you're

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:49.060 
you're hanging with your people you're

00:03:33.660 --> 00:03:33.670 
around right so the whole progression

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:36.420 
around right so the whole progression
actually<00:03:34.480> is<00:03:34.600> made<00:03:34.840> up<00:03:35.019> of<00:03:35.230> you<00:03:35.680> know<00:03:35.709> hundreds

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:38.410 
of achievements most of which actually

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:39.810 
of achievements most of which actually
are<00:03:38.709> like<00:03:38.890> pretty<00:03:39.040> straightforward<00:03:39.700> it's

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:39.820 
are like pretty straightforward it's

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:41.460
