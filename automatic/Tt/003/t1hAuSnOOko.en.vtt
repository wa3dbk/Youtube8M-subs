twenty percent increased healing from

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.020 
twenty percent increased healing from
other<00:01:08.570> sources<00:01:08.840> it<00:01:09.710> doesn't<00:01:10.640> affect<00:01:10.910> you

hailing like oh my god that is so
awesome<00:01:18.700> so<00:01:19.700> I<00:01:19.729> took<00:01:20.030> that<00:01:20.560> glyph<00:01:21.560> a<00:01:21.650> blind<00:01:21.890> of

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:22.100 
awesome so I took that glyph a blind of

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.980 
awesome so I took that glyph a blind of
course<00:01:22.340> you're<00:01:23.000> blinded<00:01:23.299> building<00:01:23.540> also

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:23.990 
course you're blinded building also

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:25.780

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:30.979 
that would cause blind to break early so

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:33.429 
that would cause blind to break early so
that's<00:01:31.280> a<00:01:31.399> net<00:01:31.670> must<00:01:31.939> mean<00:01:32.119> lets<00:01:32.360> you<00:01:32.479> take<00:01:32.810> the

maximum health and with the new gloves

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:51.609 
maximum health and with the new gloves
there<00:01:50.659> the<00:01:50.869> clip<00:01:51.079> for<00:01:51.200> the<00:01:51.229> gloves<00:01:51.439> has
