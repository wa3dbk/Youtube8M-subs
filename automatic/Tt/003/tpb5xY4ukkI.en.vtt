00:01:56.529 --> 00:01:56.539 
put a bigger wheel on there and this one

00:01:56.539 --> 00:01:58.630 
put a bigger wheel on there and this one
just<00:01:57.020> didn't<00:01:57.319> do<00:01:57.439> I'm<00:01:57.770> good<00:01:57.950> enough<00:01:58.039> so<00:01:58.399> I<00:01:58.429> put

a<00:01:58.670> second<00:01:58.970> one<00:01:59.060> in<00:01:59.210> I<00:02:00.110> also<00:02:00.770> installed<00:02:01.099> the

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:01.720 
a second one in I also installed the

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:08.320 
a second one in I also installed the
servo<00:02:02.720> guards<00:02:03.200> out<00:02:03.920> there<00:02:04.390> and<00:02:05.390> out<00:02:05.569> there<00:02:07.330> put

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:08.330 
servo guards out there and out there put

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.500 
servo guards out there and out there put
those<00:02:08.479> back<00:02:08.780> on<00:02:08.989> there<00:02:09.259> I<00:02:10.299> changed<00:02:11.299> out<00:02:11.390> the

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:11.510 
those back on there I changed out the

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.059 
those back on there I changed out the
brake<00:02:11.690> pads<00:02:11.930> in<00:02:12.200> it<00:02:12.349> because<00:02:12.860> this<00:02:13.010> thing

00:02:13.059 --> 00:02:13.069 
brake pads in it because this thing

00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:15.640 
brake pads in it because this thing
needed<00:02:13.459> some<00:02:14.090> extra<00:02:14.390> braking<00:02:15.110> power<00:02:15.290> for

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:15.650 
needed some extra braking power for

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.729 
needed some extra braking power for
these<00:02:16.000> how<00:02:17.000> much<00:02:17.209> more<00:02:17.450> ways<00:02:17.690> it<00:02:18.290> weighs<00:02:18.500> are

00:02:18.729 --> 00:02:18.739 
these how much more ways it weighs are

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:22.059 
these how much more ways it weighs are
good<00:02:20.019> that<00:02:21.019> way<00:02:21.140> is<00:02:21.200> it<00:02:21.349> good<00:02:21.440> to<00:02:21.650> three<00:02:21.920> pounds

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:22.069 
good that way is it good to three pounds

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:26.410 
good that way is it good to three pounds
more<00:02:23.799> that's<00:02:24.799> look<00:02:25.130> at<00:02:25.250> it<00:02:25.489> I<00:02:25.670> do<00:02:26.120> have<00:02:26.390> a

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:26.420 
more that's look at it I do have a

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.690 
more that's look at it I do have a
smaller<00:02:27.230> receiver<00:02:27.680> box<00:02:27.980> from<00:02:28.250> this<00:02:28.430> tracks

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700 
smaller receiver box from this tracks

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.640 
smaller receiver box from this tracks
layer<00:02:29.120> on<00:02:30.110> here<00:02:31.150> does<00:02:32.150> that<00:02:32.299> reverse<00:02:32.600> and<00:02:33.079> it

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
layer on here does that reverse and it

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:43.070 
layer on here does that reverse and it
