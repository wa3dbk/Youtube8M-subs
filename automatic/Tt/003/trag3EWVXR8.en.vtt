half<00:01:28.310> hours<00:01:29.000> late<00:01:29.299> I<00:01:29.720> thought<00:01:30.320> but<00:01:30.610> getting

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:31.610 
half hours late I thought but getting

half hours late I thought but getting
into<00:01:31.939> North<00:01:32.600> Africa<00:01:33.049> was<00:01:33.200> fairly<00:01:33.830> tricky<00:01:34.759> but

into North Africa was fairly tricky but
it<00:01:35.270> turns<00:01:35.600> out<00:01:35.780> certain<00:01:36.110> in<00:01:36.170> terms<00:01:36.380> the<00:01:36.500> amount

00:01:36.639 --> 00:01:36.649 
it turns out certain in terms the amount

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:39.160 
it turns out certain in terms the amount
of<00:01:36.710> time<00:01:36.890> as<00:01:37.039> it<00:01:37.159> bakes<00:01:37.310> it's<00:01:38.299> a<00:01:38.570> it's<00:01:38.960> a<00:01:39.020> walk

00:02:48.020 --> 00:03:01.390 

and<00:02:48.260> we've<00:02:48.410> got<00:02:48.560> a<00:02:48.590> range<00:02:48.890> of<00:02:49.480> minus<00:02:50.480> 600<00:02:50.960> miles

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:01.400 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.420 

this<00:03:02.400> is<00:03:02.810> exactly<00:03:03.810> what<00:03:04.110> we<00:03:04.350> didn't<00:03:05.160> want<00:03:05.220> to

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
this is exactly what we didn't want to

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:10.430 
this is exactly what we didn't want to

you<00:03:10.740> can<00:03:10.890> probably<00:03:11.070> see<00:03:11.250> it<00:03:12.240> ain't<00:03:12.420> going

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:12.720 
you can probably see it ain't going

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:14.060 
you can probably see it ain't going
anywhere<00:03:12.960> fast

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.070 
anywhere fast

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:16.700

presumably all in trying to answer the
same<00:03:34.440> areas<00:03:34.860> us<00:03:35.040> we<00:03:35.850> don't<00:03:36.030> have<00:03:36.180> that<00:03:36.330> option

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510 
same areas us we don't have that option

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:41.210 
same areas us we don't have that option
and<00:03:36.870> they<00:03:37.560> are<00:03:37.710> NRI<00:03:38.040> as<00:03:39.030> we<00:03:39.300> should<00:03:39.360> be<00:03:39.690> but<00:03:40.590> we

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:41.220 
and they are NRI as we should be but we

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:43.340 
and they are NRI as we should be but we
go<00:03:41.370> very<00:03:41.520> fast<00:03:41.760> with<00:03:41.970> it<00:03:42.090> never<00:03:42.240> goes<00:03:42.480> off<00:03:42.750> if

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 
go very fast with it never goes off if

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:46.280 
go very fast with it never goes off if
we<00:03:43.560> go<00:03:43.710> at<00:03:44.100> this<00:03:44.220> speed<00:03:44.490> which<00:03:44.730> is<00:03:45.080> six<00:03:46.080> miles

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.290 
we go at this speed which is six miles

00:03:46.290 --> 00:04:52.050 
we go at this speed which is six miles
an<00:03:46.440> hour<00:03:46.590> we<00:03:47.220> at<00:03:47.250> least<00:03:47.430> have<00:03:47.640> a<00:03:47.670> chance

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:52.060 

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:54.660 

so<00:04:52.570> that's<00:04:52.810> it<00:04:53.020> we<00:04:53.410> have<00:04:53.560> arrived<00:04:53.860> at<00:04:54.220> good
