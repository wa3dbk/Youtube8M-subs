back<00:01:51.340> the<00:01:51.970> same<00:01:52.180> spot<00:01:52.680> alright

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
back the same spot alright

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.670 
back the same spot alright
and<00:01:54.700> drum<00:01:54.970> one<00:01:55.180> tooth<00:01:55.479> so<00:01:55.960> this<00:01:56.200> is<00:01:56.320> basically

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:56.680 
and drum one tooth so this is basically

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.030 
and drum one tooth so this is basically
a<00:01:57.030> three-sided<00:01:58.030> rectangles<00:01:58.600> sort<00:01:58.780> of

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
a three-sided rectangles sort of

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:02.190 
a three-sided rectangles sort of
converging<00:02:00.040> towards<00:02:00.310> the<00:02:00.400> point<00:02:00.580> here<00:02:01.200> he's

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
converging towards the point here he's

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.590 
converging towards the point here he's
gone<00:02:02.590> it's<00:02:02.830> kind<00:02:02.979> of<00:02:03.010> coming<00:02:03.420> draw<00:02:04.420> another

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:04.600 
gone it's kind of coming draw another

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.260 
gone it's kind of coming draw another
square<00:02:04.840> tooth<00:02:05.260> here<00:02:05.560> beside<00:02:06.040> it<00:02:06.190> and<00:02:06.970> now<00:02:07.060> this

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:07.270 
square tooth here beside it and now this

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.740 
square tooth here beside it and now this
gunmen<00:02:07.840> kind<00:02:08.200> of<00:02:08.289> comes<00:02:08.470> across<00:02:08.590> and<00:02:09.310> vacuum

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:09.750 
gunmen kind of comes across and vacuum

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.720 
gunmen kind of comes across and vacuum
and<00:02:10.750> I'll<00:02:10.899> draw<00:02:11.110> an<00:02:11.230> extra<00:02:11.620> little<00:02:11.740> straggling

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
and I'll draw an extra little straggling

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:14.020 
and I'll draw an extra little straggling
tooth<00:02:12.970> over<00:02:13.120> on<00:02:13.330> this<00:02:13.420> side

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.030 
tooth over on this side

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.400 
tooth over on this side
over<00:02:15.030> here<00:02:15.300> I'm<00:02:15.480> going<00:02:15.569> to<00:02:15.660> draw<00:02:15.810> another

this cheap back in we'll bring it back

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.220 
this cheap back in we'll bring it back
out<00:02:32.520> on<00:02:32.880> that<00:02:32.910> side<00:02:33.239> yeah<00:02:33.959> I'm<00:02:34.020> just<00:02:34.140> gonna

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:34.230

out on that side yeah I'm just gonna
cover<00:02:34.500> this<00:02:34.680> area<00:02:35.010> in<00:02:35.190> black<00:02:38.840> all<00:02:39.840> right<00:02:40.850> let's

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850 
cover this area in black all right let's

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:44.690 
cover this area in black all right let's
go<00:02:42.030> into<00:02:42.180> the<00:02:42.360> lip<00:02:43.110> the<00:02:43.380> bottom<00:02:43.620> lip<00:02:43.800> so<00:02:43.980> just

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
go into the lip the bottom lip so just

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.580 
go into the lip the bottom lip so just
about<00:02:45.000> that<00:02:45.180> lip<00:02:45.450> line<00:02:45.750> when<00:02:46.230> you<00:02:46.290> come<00:02:46.440> up

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
about that lip line when you come up

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.110 
about that lip line when you come up
here<00:02:46.800> we'll<00:02:47.190> cross<00:02:47.459> like<00:02:47.700> this<00:02:47.850> from<00:02:48.000> the

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
here we'll cross like this from the

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.440 
here we'll cross like this from the
tooth<00:02:48.590> straight<00:02:49.590> down<00:02:49.880> I'll<00:02:50.880> come<00:02:51.030> back<00:02:51.180> in<00:02:51.390> a

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
tooth straight down I'll come back in a

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.259 
tooth straight down I'll come back in a
little<00:02:51.480> bit<00:02:51.780> just<00:02:52.319> sort<00:02:52.470> of<00:02:52.530> form<00:02:52.739> that<00:02:52.920> lip

00:02:53.259 --> 00:02:53.269 
little bit just sort of form that lip

00:02:53.269 --> 00:02:55.880 
little bit just sort of form that lip
come<00:02:54.269> back<00:02:54.450> in<00:02:54.750> I'll<00:02:55.170> draw<00:02:55.440> a<00:02:55.470> straight<00:02:55.709> line

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
come back in I'll draw a straight line

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:57.440 
come back in I'll draw a straight line
down<00:02:56.100> now<00:02:56.610> this<00:02:56.730> is<00:02:56.880> where<00:02:57.060> the<00:02:57.150> chin<00:02:57.420> goes

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:57.450 
down now this is where the chin goes

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:00.009 
down now this is where the chin goes
okay<00:02:57.900> so<00:02:57.959> I'm<00:02:58.799> gonna<00:02:58.890> straight<00:02:59.220> across

00:03:00.009 --> 00:03:00.019 
okay so I'm gonna straight across

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:02.440 
okay so I'm gonna straight across
I'll<00:03:01.019> come<00:03:01.230> up<00:03:01.440> in<00:03:01.650> an<00:03:01.769> angle<00:03:02.040> a<00:03:02.100> little<00:03:02.130> bit

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:02.450 
I'll come up in an angle a little bit

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.050 
I'll come up in an angle a little bit
I'm<00:03:03.450> go<00:03:03.810> right<00:03:04.080> into<00:03:04.230> that<00:03:04.560> skull<00:03:05.069> block<00:03:05.310> on

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:06.060 
I'm go right into that skull block on

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:07.190 
I'm go right into that skull block on
this<00:03:06.269> corner<00:03:06.540> here<00:03:06.660> I'm<00:03:06.780> just<00:03:06.900> going<00:03:07.019> to<00:03:07.049> draw

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:07.200 
this corner here I'm just going to draw

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:09.350 
this corner here I'm just going to draw
a<00:03:07.230> little<00:03:07.440> backwards<00:03:07.950> l<00:03:08.160> just<00:03:08.970> didn't<00:03:09.150> to<00:03:09.209> keep

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:09.360 
a little backwards l just didn't to keep

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.289 
a little backwards l just didn't to keep
the<00:03:09.450> bottom<00:03:09.720> lip<00:03:09.870> and<00:03:10.590> in<00:03:11.100> the<00:03:11.190> first<00:03:11.400> cheek

00:03:12.289 --> 00:03:12.299 
the bottom lip and in the first cheek

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:15.080 
the bottom lip and in the first cheek
it's<00:03:12.959> basically<00:03:13.319> the<00:03:13.530> same<00:03:13.709> shape<00:03:14.010> a<00:03:14.310> little

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:15.090 
it's basically the same shape a little

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:16.550 
it's basically the same shape a little
curved<00:03:15.420> down<00:03:15.600> just<00:03:15.870> like<00:03:15.930> that<00:03:16.140> okay<00:03:16.500> so

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:16.560 
curved down just like that okay so

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:18.890 
curved down just like that okay so
there's<00:03:16.860> this<00:03:16.950> head<00:03:17.450> see<00:03:18.450> into<00:03:18.600> the<00:03:18.690> rest<00:03:18.840> of

00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:18.900 
there's this head see into the rest of

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.660 
there's this head see into the rest of
the<00:03:18.959> body<00:03:19.109> so<00:03:19.230> it<00:03:19.500> draws<00:03:19.620> arm<00:03:19.980> first<00:03:20.280> because

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
the body so it draws arm first because

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:21.650 
the body so it draws arm first because
this<00:03:20.820> is<00:03:20.910> the<00:03:21.060> thing<00:03:21.239> that's<00:03:21.359> in<00:03:21.540> the

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:21.660 
this is the thing that's in the

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.880 
this is the thing that's in the
foreground<00:03:22.579> okay<00:03:23.579> so<00:03:23.820> up<00:03:24.030> here<00:03:24.470> he's<00:03:25.470> got<00:03:25.680> a

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:25.890 
foreground okay so up here he's got a

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:28.550 
foreground okay so up here he's got a
shoulder<00:03:26.250> that<00:03:26.910> comes<00:03:27.090> straight<00:03:27.329> down<00:03:27.530> do<00:03:28.530> a

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
shoulder that comes straight down do a

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:31.130 
shoulder that comes straight down do a
couple<00:03:28.859> ways<00:03:28.980> the<00:03:29.220> bottom<00:03:29.579> here<00:03:30.140> continue

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:31.140 
couple ways the bottom here continue

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:33.170 
couple ways the bottom here continue
this<00:03:31.260> on<00:03:31.410> the<00:03:31.530> other<00:03:31.620> side<00:03:31.950> do<00:03:32.760> a<00:03:32.790> couple<00:03:33.060> ways

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
this on the other side do a couple ways

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:35.569 
this on the other side do a couple ways
or<00:03:33.540> some<00:03:33.720> wrinkles<00:03:34.140> okay<00:03:34.950> so<00:03:35.340> there's<00:03:35.519> this

or some wrinkles okay so there's this
arm<00:03:35.880> let's<00:03:36.780> draw<00:03:37.019> a<00:03:37.380> couple<00:03:37.560> of<00:03:37.980> angled<00:03:38.660> lines

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:39.660 
arm let's draw a couple of angled lines

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.520 
arm let's draw a couple of angled lines
for<00:03:40.049> tearing<00:03:40.829> asleep<00:03:41.720> and<00:03:42.720> over<00:03:42.989> here<00:03:43.320> I'm

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:43.530 
for tearing asleep and over here I'm

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:45.289 
for tearing asleep and over here I'm
just<00:03:43.650> going<00:03:43.829> to<00:03:43.890> connect<00:03:44.130> the<00:03:44.280> two<00:03:44.519> lines<00:03:44.880> with

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:45.299 
just going to connect the two lines with

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:48.710 
just going to connect the two lines with
a<00:03:45.329> curve<00:03:45.780> this<00:03:46.769> is<00:03:46.829> for<00:03:47.160> the<00:03:47.280> cuff<00:03:47.489> I<00:03:47.850> put

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:48.720 
a curve this is for the cuff I put

hand first I'm going to draw two curved

00:05:11.900 --> 00:05:13.960 
hand first I'm going to draw two curved
line<00:05:12.140> sort<00:05:12.440> of<00:05:12.530> coming<00:05:13.220> in<00:05:13.550> towards<00:05:13.880> each

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:13.970 
line sort of coming in towards each

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:16.750 
line sort of coming in towards each
other<00:05:14.230> I'll<00:05:15.230> kick<00:05:15.470> one<00:05:15.650> line<00:05:15.860> out<00:05:16.040> for<00:05:16.490> his

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:16.760 
other I'll kick one line out for his

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:21.280 
other I'll kick one line out for his
first<00:05:17.030> finger<00:05:17.390> come<00:05:18.290> down<00:05:18.530> cross<00:05:19.370> and<00:05:19.450> up<00:05:20.450> okay

first finger come down cross and up okay
so<00:05:21.350> it's<00:05:21.590> just<00:05:21.770> basically<00:05:22.130> a<00:05:22.250> series<00:05:22.460> of

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:22.610 
so it's just basically a series of

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:26.560 
so it's just basically a series of
angles<00:05:23.320> draw<00:05:24.320> his<00:05:24.590> other<00:05:24.860> finger<00:05:25.510> like<00:05:26.510> that

and then I'm gonna do a series of

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:35.400 
and then I'm gonna do a series of
overlaps<00:05:28.550> here<00:05:29.140> okay<00:05:31.600> all<00:05:32.600> right<00:05:33.490> draw

overlaps here okay all right draw
finishing<00:05:36.410> lines<00:05:36.740> there<00:05:37.010> and<00:05:37.220> then<00:05:37.940> keep

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:38.120 
finishing lines there and then keep

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:40.600 
finishing lines there and then keep
going<00:05:38.150> and<00:05:38.570> draw<00:05:38.750> some<00:05:39.250> Curtis<00:05:40.250> for<00:05:40.460> his
