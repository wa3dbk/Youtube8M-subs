00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.050
 1666 

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.529
 Talk to people, I'm giving. 

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:33.920
 bringing the first video here on the channel 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:35.150
 And well you should have seen it seems 

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:37.940
 macro right 

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:40.309
 I have a way by clicking because it is but it is not 

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:44.120
 macro win this here is a new way 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:47.180
 that I discovered has little time stirring 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:49.580
 in the synapse there and this is for those who do not know 

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:53.590
 sign your device that the 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:56.809
 new software device to 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:58.340
 Peripheral royalty and well I was 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:00.590
 To work there these days. 

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:05.420
 Then I discovered a very hourly deal. 

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:07.160
 I just moved and you can click 

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.710
 much faster with this in reality 

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:12.440
 type you will not have clicking you will 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:15.259
 is climbing because this way I 

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:18.020
 find out the name says pro then click the 

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:20.539
 what you do it come very simple 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:23.119
 you will not be left clicking 

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:26.119
 normal left mouse button you 

00:01:23.119 --> 00:01:28.840
 it is scrolling with scroll that is the 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:32.330
 wheel that has your mouse for who knows 

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:34.040
 and it gets much faster you do not 

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:37.760
 have notion look at just how much the particles 

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:39.560
 that is coming out this is a lot from 

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:43.670
 so connected 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:47.030
 Like I'm climbing, shall we say? 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:50.360
 slowly fastest school to school 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:53.659
 my face died a lot but it's 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:57.020
 basically this will replace the 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:59.659
 mouse click the scroll by 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.700
 Your own up and down that 

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:03.200
 we take in the senate if you have like you 

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:06.259
 configure this I do not know if any 

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:10.340
 other software RedeTV software not 

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:12.110
 software from logitech room or if said 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.910
 Anything that has this 

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.310
 option of you tinkering with your own movies 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:17.630
 own bass but I have to 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.850
 synapses that I have is included in the 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:23.769
 reset for those who do not know is a 

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:26.720
 device that I use then is what 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:29.120
 I learned then, I do not even know if it's going to take 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.000
 others but if you let me know that I 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:35.230
 I have no idea 

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:37.450
 But anyway I'm going to change the 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:39.250
 Work beach I'll show and 

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.860
 to teach you how you do it 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.390
 Good people, I'm back here now, I 'm going 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:45.580
 to teach you how you do to 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:47.709
 set sketches of the dead 

00:02:45.580 --> 00:02:50.830
 well first you have to do it 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:53.590
 There's something here and lime in the chrome is making a 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:59.980
 new high school profile if you want 

00:02:53.590 --> 00:03:01.900
 put cell of abcd efg put 

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:04.390
 So well now what do you have to do? 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:05.860
 when I started to move in the synapse 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:08.080
 The first thing I tried to do was 

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.940
 right here in the scroll up and 

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:13.209
 put the mouse function 

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:15.340
 only with the synapse it does not have this 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:18.370
 option you put right here 

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:20.170
 so you will have to come here macros 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:22.270
 You'll have to create only one that 

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:25.120
 will be a framework for self - criticism. 

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:27.370
 your wife will not be a macro of just 

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:30.340
 one literally just one click you're coming 

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:32.860
 here and puts without giving basically time 

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:34.720
 will do normal function without delays 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:36.190
 but will not interfere with anything in the 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:39.970
 reality you put brings a pattern 

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:41.980
 one thing but anyway you come here have 

00:03:39.970 --> 00:03:44.170
 that record simply click 

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:46.120
 ready the avaÃ­ to clear simple 

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:49.299
 so now you have to record with the 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:51.190
 macro 4 now you come here on the mouse comes 

00:03:49.299 --> 00:03:53.350
 here in scrolling up places default 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:55.209
 and coke macro there is here as it already had 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:57.970
 which was a click and put macro four 

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:59.829
 withdrawals and other 1 2 3 4 5 and such was the 

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:02.709
 attempt that he recorded a short time 

00:03:59.829 --> 00:04:04.870
 back but that's what macro 4 puts and puts 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:06.730
 to produce once does not put several 

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:09.190
 Sometimes that's the way it is sometimes 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:11.290
 considered considerably time 

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:13.239
 because it is applying more than one 

00:04:11.290 --> 00:04:15.760
 instead what you would have applied 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:16.660
 usually and would be as if it were 

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.890
 doubleclick 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:19.750
 but in case it is not that we are 

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:23.710
 wanting to do here then we just 

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:26.560
 puts macro 4 so it's a click 

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:29.530
 does the same process in the other room of 

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:31.060
 everyone was ready once there 

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:33.460
 simple profile so 

00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:36.160
 now you just go there at the beginning of view 

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:38.410
 well now not only one thing that I have 

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:40.570
 I have to tell you that I'm not 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:42.820
 officially recommending you so 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:43.330
 use on some servers type this pv p 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:46.090
 u 

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:48.099
 the servers perpetually by cars 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:49.750
 combat that now comes but I recorded 

00:04:48.099 --> 00:04:51.280
 so only because the only server that 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:54.580
 was open at the time that time 

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:58.509
 I recorded type had black that I in the case 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:05:01.689
 another beto lac day care and the false penis that 

00:04:58.509 --> 00:05:03.729
 I have to be right but she does not 

00:05:01.689 --> 00:05:06.610
 It was open and I took what I 

00:05:03.729 --> 00:05:09.069
 enter such a game there has a larger chain and 

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:11.560
 so I play short there 

00:05:09.069 --> 00:05:14.020
 well I did not get to ask to top 

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:16.330
 me yet but I'm going to record this 

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:17.949
 video here anything they find 

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:19.690
 I'm using demacro send to them 

00:05:17.949 --> 00:05:22.389
 this video here type 

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:25.539
 is one of the administered this 

00:05:22.389 --> 00:05:29.110
 video or ask you if this is 

00:05:25.539 --> 00:05:30.969
 considered author click macro from 

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:33.039
 self-criticism because at least in the 

00:05:30.969 --> 00:05:34.960
 my view does not consider this the project 

00:05:33.039 --> 00:05:37.090
 click because you're not doing anything 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:38.830
 nothing less than just remapping the 

00:05:37.090 --> 00:05:40.810
 mouse buttons you are not putting 

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:44.020
 a normal click 

00:05:40.810 --> 00:05:46.810
 the scroll fine will be an advantage 

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:50.379
 but you can make believe that you can 

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:53.440
 do this with any mouse think 

00:05:50.379 --> 00:05:55.810
 I think even more so it will be the 

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:57.849
 new clone but so multilaser 

00:05:55.810 --> 00:06:00.310
 Well, little booty, but I think it works. 

00:05:57.849 --> 00:06:02.229
 to do that download will be a program 

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:04.180
 mouse configuration, but then it is 

00:06:02.229 --> 00:06:06.669
 This was what I wanted to teach you. 

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:10.000
 well guys , if you want to use 

00:06:06.669 --> 00:06:11.979
 use and good but as I said do not use 

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.289
 receive mainly because I do not even 

00:06:11.979 --> 00:06:17.199
 you know how a lael with chip 

00:06:14.289 --> 00:06:20.080
 people there is a top thing and I do not know 

00:06:17.199 --> 00:06:23.110
 you click but I think five times 

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:25.870
 The second you already take bank let's say 

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:27.669
 so a little bit more but then 

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:30.789
 does not recommend using it there for now 

00:06:27.669 --> 00:06:33.069
 until at least you know with 

00:06:30.789 --> 00:06:35.860
 confirmed so you can use more 

00:06:33.069 --> 00:06:38.139
 so is this guys is finalizing the 

00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:40.330
 video here is one to leave a like and 

00:06:38.139 --> 00:06:43.449
 If you liked it if you think the video 

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:45.580
 deserves a like and this is also lets the 

00:06:43.449 --> 00:06:47.139
 comments you found helpful tip and 

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:49.360
 also if you ever asked to 

00:06:47.139 --> 00:06:52.580
 some molds and this is allowed 

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:54.530
 I left in the field of comments to the Serbian 

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:56.240
 This is what I'm already writing down. 

00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:58.189
 servers a bit in the registration of 

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:59.419
 servers that are allowing this 

00:06:58.189 --> 00:07:02.389
 then that's it 

00:06:59.419 --> 00:07:04.099
 It was worth bringing more videos now with more 

00:07:02.389 --> 00:07:06.620
 often because we got there and vitinho 

00:07:04.099 --> 00:07:07.699
 that the case 35 download average 20 

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:10.490
 Upload then 

00:07:07.699 --> 00:07:13.819
 top utopian propape good thing 

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:17.530
 Let's do it there and everything, then that's it. 

00:07:13.819 --> 00:07:17.530
 signals a video spoke
