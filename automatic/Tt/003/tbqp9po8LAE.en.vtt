without<00:00:59.699> focus<00:01:00.210> this<00:01:00.420> is<00:01:00.539> still<00:01:00.719> very

00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:00.899 
without focus this is still very

00:01:00.899 --> 00:01:02.689 
without focus this is still very
possible<00:01:01.469> but<00:01:01.800> you<00:01:02.100> may<00:01:02.309> have<00:01:02.340> a<00:01:02.489> position

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
possible but you may have a position

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.399 
possible but you may have a position
yourself<00:01:03.239> slightly<00:01:03.449> to<00:01:03.719> the<00:01:03.750> side<00:01:03.870> and

yourself slightly to the side and
anticipate<00:01:05.339> the<00:01:05.519> term<00:01:05.760> of<00:01:06.030> they<00:01:06.180> all<00:01:06.360> feel

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
anticipate the term of they all feel

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.380

towards<00:01:07.080> you<00:01:07.200> to<00:01:07.470> hit<00:01:07.619> the<00:01:07.740> face<00:01:08.090> if<00:01:09.090> it<00:01:09.270> is

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
towards you to hit the face if it is

tired<00:01:09.720> you<00:01:10.439> can<00:01:10.619> usually<00:01:10.740> go<00:01:11.010> for<00:01:11.040> the<00:01:11.310> tail

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:11.520 
tired you can usually go for the tail

to complete you have more time to run
back<00:01:16.770> and<00:01:17.040> hit<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.400> tail<00:01:17.580> of<00:01:17.850> course<00:01:18.750> you<00:01:18.840> can

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
back and hit the tail of course you can

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.359 
back and hit the tail of course you can
also<00:01:19.049> have<00:01:19.200> to<00:01:19.259> fail<00:01:19.439> if<00:01:19.590> it's<00:01:19.740> not<00:01:19.890> facing<00:01:20.310> you

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
also have to fail if it's not facing you

of<00:01:40.549> the<00:01:40.640> covering<00:01:41.060> is<00:01:41.179> the<00:01:41.539> toning<00:01:42.079> a<00:01:42.350> bit<00:01:43.100> more

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 
of the covering is the toning a bit more

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.919 
of the covering is the toning a bit more
tricky<00:01:43.569> but<00:01:44.569> it's<00:01:45.530> really<00:01:45.740> the<00:01:46.750> first<00:01:47.750> thing

00:01:47.919 --> 00:01:47.929 
tricky but it's really the first thing

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:49.559 
tricky but it's really the first thing
you<00:01:48.020> need<00:01:48.109> to<00:01:48.170> know<00:01:48.289> is<00:01:48.590> if<00:01:49.159> you're<00:01:49.429> not

00:01:49.559 --> 00:01:49.569 
you need to know is if you're not

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:51.940 
you need to know is if you're not
immediately<00:01:50.569> next<00:01:51.049> to<00:01:51.229> it<00:01:51.380> when<00:01:51.560> it<00:01:51.590> finishes

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
immediately next to it when it finishes

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:53.770 
immediately next to it when it finishes
its<00:01:52.249> charge<00:01:52.549> you<00:01:52.880> probably<00:01:53.270> aren't<00:01:53.450> gonna<00:01:53.659> get

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
its charge you probably aren't gonna get

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.190 
its charge you probably aren't gonna get
a<00:01:53.840> little<00:01:54.049> 3m<00:01:54.560> like<00:01:55.459> this<00:01:55.840> that<00:01:56.840> wasn't<00:01:57.170> a

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:57.200 
a little 3m like this that wasn't a

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.130 
a little 3m like this that wasn't a
level<00:01:57.469> three<00:01:57.619> oversee<00:01:58.299> but<00:01:59.299> it's<00:01:59.479> better<00:01:59.659> to

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.140 
level three oversee but it's better to

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.709 
level three oversee but it's better to
stay<00:02:00.950> alive<00:02:01.189> usually<00:02:01.819> things<00:02:02.060> take<00:02:02.390> back<00:02:02.539> to

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:02.719 
stay alive usually things take back to

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:04.270 
stay alive usually things take back to
the<00:02:02.840> face<00:02:03.020> unless<00:02:03.799> you're<00:02:03.950> sure<00:02:03.979> you<00:02:04.130> can

00:02:07.779 --> 00:02:07.789 
stagger here I refer to lab that gives

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:09.669 
stagger here I refer to lab that gives
me<00:02:08.000> a<00:02:08.030> lot<00:02:08.179> more<00:02:08.239> time<00:02:08.720> to<00:02:09.019> start<00:02:09.229> my<00:02:09.410> charge

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:09.679 
me a lot more time to start my charge

00:02:09.679 --> 00:02:12.839 
me a lot more time to start my charge
and<00:02:10.099> I'll<00:02:10.610> add<00:02:10.819> it<00:02:10.849> on<00:02:11.090> the<00:02:11.209> face<00:02:11.390> for<00:02:11.930> easily

00:02:12.839 --> 00:02:12.849 
and I'll add it on the face for easily

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:15.490 
and I'll add it on the face for easily
here's<00:02:13.849> an<00:02:13.940> example<00:02:14.180> here<00:02:14.480> chasing<00:02:14.720> it<00:02:14.989> I<00:02:15.140> will

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:15.500 
here's an example here chasing it I will
