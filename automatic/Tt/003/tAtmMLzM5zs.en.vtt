00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:12.070
 [Music] 

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:19.980
 hello guys this is one more tip doctor 

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:22.289
 in the field we will show here how it is 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.680
 that the signal of a lambda probe is closed 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:27.930
 bandwidth applied in vehicle cycle 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.230
 otto okay that we have a probe 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:35.820
 manufacturer bosch né 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:38.309
 She has six and the side of the whip and five 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:40.170
 wires on the sensor side a 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:42.840
 feature of this sensor. 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.510
 bosch manufacturer is that the wires on the side 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:48.270
 sensor on the side wires the sensor 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:51.660
 colors are standard there on the sensor side 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:55.320
 we're going to have the five color yarns 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:01:00.239
 one of them is red one yellow one one white 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:03.930
 a gray and a black being the thread that 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:07.320
 gray is the heater's positive 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:10.080
 probe a white wire is the control 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.770
 band probe heater 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.780
 long 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.420
 remembering that in the broadband shadow 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.659
 or probe heater has a 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:22.680
 resistance ranging from two to five 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:25.259
 men then the gray and white wires are 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:30.030
 the wires of the right probe heater 

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:32.729
 already the black and yellow threads are other 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:37.079
 two films are the black and yellow one wire 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:41.640
 black and yellow are actually the 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:44.700
 black is the power supply 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.920
 sensor element and the yellow wire is the 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:50.970
 power supply negative 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:55.020
 sensor ie the black and yellow they 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:57.869
 they do sometimes than a probe gray 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:00.420
 narrowband is then 

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.880
 broadband black and yellow are 

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:05.549
 supplying the ceramic element such as 

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:09.270
 sensor element of the broadband probe 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:12.000
 and the most important is the wire 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:14.220
 the red thread of the subject that red 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.900
 is the sign son that we are going to evaluate 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.460
 he here to see how we know 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:21.360
 this subject is responding in a 

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:22.200
 between rich blend and 

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:24.450
 poor 

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.420
 The first test we'll do is 

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.460
 an important test that is the control 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.630
 of the subject heater I'm going to turn off 

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:36.180
 the vehicle is going I'm going to turn off the vehicle 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:38.040
 to show what happens to the 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:41.550
 heater control turned off the vehicle 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:43.200
 sure my oscilloscope now not 

00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:44.670
 is not marking anything or marking 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.740
 intention to hit because the cast 

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.380
 main is still armed right 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:53.310
 feeding the probe heater my 

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:55.770
 the oscilloscope is connected exactly on the 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:59.220
 sensor that is the control of the 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:01.020
 negative heater is sure to give the 

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:03.650
 on the vehicle and observe what 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:06.690
 happens in the heater control 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:09.630
 observes that in the first moment the cycle 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:13.050
 negative work is 2 percent and 

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:15.810
 frequency 102 is the cycle of 

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:18.300
 work he has now increased to almost 90 

00:03:15.810 --> 00:03:22.800
 that is, the heater was 

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:26.490
 enough is connected almost containment of 

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:29.040
 battery in it now the control pulse 

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:32.660
 the heater has changed to a cycle of 

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:36.750
 negative work approximately 50% 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:37.770
 sure jealous attention is in the negative of 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.450
 heater 

00:03:37.770 --> 00:03:42.510
 I'll realize that I have an attention. 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:45.690
 of approximately 7 thousand volts, that the 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:48.720
 medium voltage of this pulsed signal here 

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:51.390
 which is the negative control signal of the 

00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:54.630
 heater then negative 

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:56.459
 probe heater when the probe when 

00:03:54.630 --> 00:03:57.900
 the control unit is controlling 

00:03:56.459 --> 00:04:00.540
 heater negative 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:02.640
 I will have less attention than the 

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:05.940
 battery voltage that is what happens 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:09.120
 there because this sign here is that I 

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:11.550
 I'm measuring there on the white wire of the probe. 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:14.310
 That 's the same sign that we have here. 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:15.989
 no oscilloscope is there last Sunday 

00:04:14.310 --> 00:04:19.080
 on the average signal né 

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:21.579
 is the negative control signal of the 

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:24.189
 heater you observe what since 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:28.419
 I started the pulse width 

00:04:24.189 --> 00:04:30.840
 It varies that I'll hang up again and go 

00:04:28.419 --> 00:04:30.840
 call again 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:36.669
 observe the width of the pulse initially 

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:39.430
 the control unit is almost 

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:41.979
 connecting the heater would be called now 

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:43.599
 that the voltage drops and the pulse width 

00:04:41.979 --> 00:04:46.120
 negative increases 

00:04:43.599 --> 00:04:49.000
 then this variation of the pulse width 

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:51.099
 negative heater control shows 

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.560
 that the heater's negative control 

00:04:51.099 --> 00:04:56.710
 heater broadband is a summary 

00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:58.900
 pw sign it which is the same thing as 

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:01.060
 happens in the narrow band the staff 

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:02.710
 must have accompanied ii in videos 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:05.379
 previous authorship that people 

00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:07.930
 showed the heater control of the 

00:05:05.379 --> 00:05:09.849
 narrowband probe that is more or less 

00:05:07.930 --> 00:05:11.889
 less is more or less equal to that of 

00:05:09.849 --> 00:05:14.349
 bandwidth then in control of the 

00:05:11.889 --> 00:05:15.430
 we have nothing 

00:05:14.349 --> 00:05:17.529
 different. 

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:20.259
 the heater control is more or less 

00:05:17.529 --> 00:05:24.430
 the same thing as the narrowband probe 

00:05:20.259 --> 00:05:27.610
 Okay, now we 'll show you how it's 

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:30.370
 happens with the signal on the red wire that 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:32.050
 the red wire is the signal wire of the sound 

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:35.319
 broadband as it should be 

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:39.539
 signal behavior on the band probe 

00:05:35.319 --> 00:05:39.539
 on the red wire of the probe.
