00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:30.140
 the canal schiphol sancho i pass duck 

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:34.340
 of angelina and pitt spoke patience zone 

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:38.080
 It goes up further, it fills me up suddenly if I 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.080
 would go on with it 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:55.730
 the chip on where the borders 

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:58.489
 Brazilian agricultural production are 

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:01.280
 much about the cerrado and caatinga biomes 

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:03.380
 but not yet closed, not only this 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.399
 Other species also lose their 

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:06.079
 habitat 

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:09.139
 then this causes the 

00:01:06.079 --> 00:01:11.389
 amount of animals in nature outside the 

00:01:09.139 --> 00:01:13.100
 game hunting pressure are both 

00:01:11.389 --> 00:01:24.789
 main causes for this animal 

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:24.789
 I was thus thrown a penguin 

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:32.389
 perfect nÃ© soccer ball 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:34.279
 armadillo he gets in the way he 

00:01:32.389 --> 00:01:36.590
 was perfect 

00:01:34.279 --> 00:01:38.119
 from this point of view in this analogy 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.829
 perfect 

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:43.039
 when you can give visibility to 

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:46.639
 An animal you have to take advantage of 

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:50.359
 moment to get along with it is 

00:01:46.639 --> 00:01:54.229
 actions that are beneficial to the species 

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:57.219
 such a 101 repeated of the acronym tic is a calla
