00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.110
 to provide the known functions to the fine arts 

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:38.510
 this was the concern of the Spanish team may argued in the 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:40.650
 eighteenth century 

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:44.150
 Many of this task is finally finished 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:49.540
 In 1988 they had separated 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:54.430
 For around 20 years, the number of people in demand worldwide has been on almost everyone 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:56.500
 Continents on the way 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:57.970
 in today's cast 

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:00.970
 have been playing together for two years 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.960
 Red today 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.960
 that is of course one 

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:29.830
 we meet each other 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:34.840
 I really have to say that there really is, despite all the casualness of the 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:38.620
 Otherwise percent can sometimes adjust if you solve it yourself if 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:41.500
 Being your own sir, you are offered something 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:45.060
 very disciplined publicly available punctually 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.060
 the minute 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.600
 many municipalities and subject 

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.040
 not because customers and unrhythmic special for us and we do not agree 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:02.250
 or that we are also easy in doing so 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.650
 in the 4 swing the same and that we just pass through an admittedly 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:07.830
 very and 

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:12.250
 Music in itself and musically is aid but feel this «one 

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.089
 important - and then and to these 

00:02:15.089 --> 00:02:18.089
 I am re-adjusting the new orientation 

00:02:41.459 --> 00:02:44.640
 Interpretations is a very dangerous choice of words 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.590
 he does not want to make the music his own but not that he does 

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:48.929
 actually 

00:02:48.929 --> 00:02:50.390
 with transport 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:54.050
 and free the body as much as possible 

00:02:55.359 --> 00:02:56.880
 from their own 

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:00.810
 Barb, so to speak, where the music is tight, he should actually by 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:03.049
 our bodies and me our ensemble 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:06.049
 By locking one must be hard on 

00:03:06.589 --> 00:03:09.939
 as force sets report 

00:03:09.939 --> 00:03:15.790
 Well known HTC brings the quotes it has discovered us a pity and for the country 

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:20.909
 be very sensitive the turn signals 5 with which they after the Fri 

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:26.510
 the result of that is certainly very serious, pay attention to finding it 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:28.529
 and what happens and 

00:03:28.529 --> 00:03:31.729
 it is more important to him 

00:03:31.729 --> 00:03:34.649
 Omen Mar 

00:03:34.649 --> 00:03:37.889
 the judge 

00:03:37.889 --> 00:03:40.899
 the reason is 

00:03:40.899 --> 00:03:44.629
 Neumarkt Blantyre 

00:03:45.289 --> 00:03:49.999
 therefore, like me, they do it here 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:55.260
 that is I can not do them but he agrees Dr 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:56.529
 Nathan is 

00:03:56.529 --> 00:03:57.569
 that was 

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:00.599
 that's a few 

00:04:00.599 --> 00:04:03.029
 Percent can be achieved 

00:04:03.029 --> 00:04:05.909
 yes and more 

00:04:05.909 --> 00:04:09.010
 was in the current year and 

00:04:13.269 --> 00:04:16.269
 Dr 

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:25.779
 Of course, it will get a faster subjective individual score 

00:04:25.779 --> 00:04:29.449
 but the word interpretation always has something for me personally 

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:30.340
 What 

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:35.120
 so that you put your own pacult on the whole and that tolerates the 

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:38.110
 Thing not actually in the pieces are already composed 

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:40.090
 and 

00:04:40.090 --> 00:04:42.819
 should then only get wings 

00:04:42.819 --> 00:04:44.360
 we have 

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:47.680
 started as a student at the conservatory 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.900
 measure more occurrences school 

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:51.809
 ounce 

00:04:51.809 --> 00:04:55.599
 Naumann for the seating stuff FOC for fun on the Freud and doors 

00:04:56.469 --> 00:04:58.540
 still very intuitive 

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:00.990
 One of the great things is that you can make music 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:02.509
 there must be very important 

00:05:02.509 --> 00:05:04.189
 Percent just start 

00:05:04.189 --> 00:05:05.150
 Peter played 

00:05:05.150 --> 00:05:07.069
 We still have that time around 

00:05:07.069 --> 00:05:10.610
 Courses also made official at the Cologne Music Academy at Madame 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:14.120
 Berg studied it. That's how it went on. Eberhard went there 

00:05:14.119 --> 00:05:15.240
 Feltz gone 

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.240
 For example, I simply sign it, too 

00:05:19.589 --> 00:05:21.699
 have been this whole 

00:05:21.699 --> 00:05:25.210
 And yet it was never said to me the first place 

00:05:26.289 --> 00:05:29.009
 where I expected that I earn my money as I have 

00:05:29.009 --> 00:05:32.180
 really earned a quartet of money from a first day but 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:34.259
 of course, a completely different framework » 

00:05:34.259 --> 00:05:37.949
 the service to Daraa at that time was really about it 

00:05:37.949 --> 00:05:41.310
 Events to frame the artist Fachraum are very many 

00:05:41.309 --> 00:05:45.669
 Industrial port do everything well that we are then in this whole percent 

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:48.589
 Provincial Government sees percent stories it was introduced 

00:05:48.589 --> 00:05:51.009
 a perfect current for us, of course 

00:05:51.009 --> 00:05:54.740
 and we just learned percent more presence 

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:57.569
 I did not go to a quartet in that sense 

00:05:57.569 --> 00:06:00.219
 that already existed 

00:06:00.219 --> 00:06:02.949
 to do with it and I founded a lot 

00:06:02.949 --> 00:06:06.699
 and I found it hard at the very beginning of my studies 

00:06:06.699 --> 00:06:10.010
 yes of course also very inexperienced was actually 

00:06:10.669 --> 00:06:14.279
 first of all, simply because of the need to play with others 

00:06:14.279 --> 00:06:16.809
 To do chamber music so now 

00:06:16.809 --> 00:06:19.990
 in the neck Amazon at the size 

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:23.840
 to play where you can really exchange ideas with each other 

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:24.660
 Listen to the orchestra 

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:27.139
 not working so well 

00:06:27.139 --> 00:06:31.919
 and playing with other people playing with me 

00:06:32.619 --> 00:06:33.489
 to play alone
