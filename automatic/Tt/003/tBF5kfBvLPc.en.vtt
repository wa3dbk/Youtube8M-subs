some eggs are infertile for various
reasons<00:00:48.930> or<00:00:49.079> don't<00:00:49.230> hatch<00:00:50.660> the<00:00:51.660> eggs<00:00:52.309> don't

reasons or don't hatch the eggs don't
hatch<00:00:53.640> all<00:00:53.910> together<00:00:54.239> they<00:00:54.480> hatch<00:00:55.010> usually<00:00:56.010> in

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
hatch all together they hatch usually in

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:58.700 
hatch all together they hatch usually in
the<00:00:56.250> order<00:00:56.489> in<00:00:56.579> which<00:00:56.610> they're<00:00:56.969> laid<00:00:57.270> and<00:00:57.710> it's

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
the order in which they're laid and it's

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.529 
the order in which they're laid and it's
normally<00:00:59.219> the<00:00:59.280> incubation<00:01:00.000> period<00:01:00.180> is

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
normally the incubation period is

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.470 
normally the incubation period is
somewhere<00:01:00.840> in<00:01:01.590> the<00:01:01.770> nature<00:01:02.129> 18<00:01:02.760> to<00:01:02.850> 21<00:01:03.149> days

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
somewhere in the nature 18 to 21 days

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.859 
somewhere in the nature 18 to 21 days
and<00:01:04.850> therefore<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:06.270> the<00:01:07.010> the<00:01:08.010> baby<00:01:08.220> chicks

00:01:08.859 --> 00:01:08.869 
and therefore the the the baby chicks

00:01:08.869 --> 00:01:15.410 
and therefore the the the baby chicks
appear<00:01:09.890> every<00:01:10.890> second<00:01:11.280> day<00:01:13.670> after<00:01:14.670> about<00:01:15.119> 18

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:15.420 
appear every second day after about 18

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.929 
appear every second day after about 18
21<00:01:16.020> days<00:01:16.320> incubation<00:01:17.159> somewhere<00:01:17.790> in<00:01:17.850> that

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939 
21 days incubation somewhere in that

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:24.289 
21 days incubation somewhere in that
order<00:01:18.119> and<00:01:21.020> it's<00:01:22.020> amazing<00:01:22.650> to<00:01:23.009> watch<00:01:23.240> how<00:01:24.240> the

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
order and it's amazing to watch how the

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:28.340 
order and it's amazing to watch how the
parents<00:01:24.930> feed<00:01:25.140> them<00:01:25.350> and<00:01:27.200> complete<00:01:28.200> each

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
parents feed them and complete each

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:33.410 
parents feed them and complete each
other<00:01:28.650> and<00:01:29.810> just<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:31.170> whole<00:01:31.590> process<00:01:32.420> is

just enjoy the whole process of course

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:03.649 
just enjoy the whole process of course
if<00:02:01.560> you<00:02:01.799> don't<00:02:01.979> want<00:02:02.189> the<00:02:02.310> bugs<00:02:02.850> to<00:02:03.060> hatch

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 
if you don't want the bugs to hatch

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:06.889 
if you don't want the bugs to hatch
there<00:02:04.259> are<00:02:04.439> ways<00:02:04.590> of<00:02:04.890> stopping<00:02:05.070> that<00:02:05.250> and<00:02:05.899> two

00:02:06.889 --> 00:02:06.899 
there are ways of stopping that and two

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:09.320 
there are ways of stopping that and two
simple<00:02:07.290> ways<00:02:07.469> to<00:02:08.250> put<00:02:08.429> a<00:02:08.459> pinprick<00:02:08.849> in<00:02:09.090> them

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.330 
simple ways to put a pinprick in them

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:13.520 
simple ways to put a pinprick in them
soon<00:02:09.750> after<00:02:10.080> their<00:02:10.170> lane<00:02:11.239> and<00:02:12.239> another<00:02:12.629> way

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
soon after their lane and another way

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.050 
soon after their lane and another way
is<00:02:13.620> to<00:02:14.600> coat<00:02:15.600> them<00:02:15.780> with<00:02:15.840> nail<00:02:16.230> varnish<00:02:16.709> so

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
is to coat them with nail varnish so

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.350 
is to coat them with nail varnish so
