00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
 hi wei new girls and up for grabs there 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:06.660
 are some products that you sent me 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.610
 a site called biolche mila that 

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:12.030
 sells hair care products 

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:14.700
 of the skin but also natural tricks o 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:17.520
 bio and especially for one of these 

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:19.560
 awards are particularly enthusiastic and 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.779
 glad that he is committed to this of wei 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.070
 as now I don't tell you anything I do 

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:24.810
 see one by one 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:26.460
 then start now for the prize on 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.420
 product that I told you this if 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:32.730
 pipe in the snow cosmetics and is the 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:35.850
 first time I try them I say that there 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.739
 I try because these products you see 

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.200
 only those destined for me are not 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.870
 those who then come home to you 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.360
 I say because there are people who can 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.950
 believe that I try the products and then ve 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:49.559
 I send them and I return is to our 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.719
 premium absolutely looks stupid 

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:53.010
 to say it however it is right in fact that it is 

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:54.989
 specify if there are people who can 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.170
 think of it so there is precisely this set 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:01:00.120
 of snow cosmetics brushes ed 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.809
 precisely the first time I try them 

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.260
 and I was appalled by the quality of the 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:06.689
 brushes 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.430
 then I tell you the ones I tried in 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:10.530
 past that are those of the but that 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.810
 they are certainly in good bars but of 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:16.439
 I said those of sephora those of 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.400
 sigma phone no longer covered topics 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:19.770
 favorite 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.850
 these are by far the best among 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.670
 the ones I tried because they are 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:26.850
 extremely soft and it is precisely this 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:28.920
 Brush sets are 12 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:31.290
 there are always in the book the face that for 

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:33.450
 the eyes then the first of the twelve 

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.640
 new teacher the first of the twelve 

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:39.299
 this brush for the account there like 

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:41.939
 you see diagonal and I hope you succeed in 

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:43.799
 see through the video camera that I am 

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:46.140
 super soft this super sector 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:48.299
 soft then there is this that the blush 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.399
 holes then need to apply the 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.990
 blush but actually it is very good second 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:54.149
 me also for the powder anyway for 

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:56.969
 all powder face products 

00:01:54.149 --> 00:01:59.930
 the third is this brush that the flat 

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:02.630
 soft pits and as you see 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.070
 and flat and is perfect for applying 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.020
 liquid foundation 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:08.000
 then there is this brush too he is 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:10.429
 perfect for the foundation because you see 

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.800
 that flat but also to apply the 

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:15.350
 corrector the fifth brush and this 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.420
 from nuance therefore it serves to go to 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:18.920
 blend the eye shadow on the crease 

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:21.080
 of the eye or for all those times 

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:24.650
 let's open the sixth 

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:26.120
 brush and this is flat and large and is 

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:28.070
 perfect for going to apply 

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:29.780
 the eye shadow on the eyelid but also for 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:30.800
 go and put the illuminant under the 

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.600
 eyebrow 

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:34.400
 then there's this brush that's it 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.560
 cat's tongue so he is fine too 

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:39.140
 for eyeshadow but to be more precise 

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:41.870
 the eighth brush is this that lengthened 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:44.630
 and it is more compact and rigid 

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:46.580
 to the others the eye shadow brushes e 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:48.650
 so it is suitable to go to 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:50.630
 tap the eye shadow on the eyelid 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:53.180
 so when we want more result 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:55.400
 intense of the most vibrant colors 

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:56.750
 this is another eye brush ea 

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:59.120
 unlike the others 

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:01.520
 at 7 o'clock the diagonals then there is this 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:06.230
 brush than the fan one like 

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:08.660
 says andrea a and i use this in 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:11.180
 so many ways to apply 

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:13.280
 illuminating to also apply blush 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:15.440
 seen very well or even ad 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:17.840
 example to apply the figure so 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.549
 very delicate and light on the whole 

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:21.440
 face but with a little all the brushes yes 

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:24.530
 they can be used in so many ways 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:27.350
 penultimate and this barely thin I am 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:29.720
 I use a lot to go to a 

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:31.610
 blend the eye shadow in the hairline 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.080
 lower lashes so when 

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:34.880
 I want to go and smudge an eye shadow but 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:36.380
 I still want to be precise, not 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.750
 I want to make a line with mature roses 

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:41.000
 too much too big and finally as in 

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:42.590
 each set is the eyeliner brush 

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.230
 then to go and draw the line 

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:47.600
 of eyeliner but at least I do it 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:49.160
 I also use a lot to go to 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:50.390
 teach me eyebrows then with a 

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:52.400
 brown eyeshadow or for me to do 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:54.739
 eyebrows with this type of di 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:56.900
 brush so this is the set with 

00:03:54.739 --> 00:03:59.160
 these 12 brushes and they are extremely 

00:03:56.900 --> 00:04:01.380
 glad it 's commitment to this 

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.850
 2 because I have been very, very long 

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:04.710
 affected by the quality of these panels 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:06.420
 because they are very soft then like 

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:08.040
 second product in the bathroom for this of 

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:10.470
 he's got this shower shampoo 

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:12.720
 clay that you take from nature 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:15.330
 cosmetics then a shower shampoo that 

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:18.269
 contains the castle oil rassul that 

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:19.739
 a clay originating from the morocco and that 

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:22.920
 it is used by oriental women 

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:26.460
 to gently wash your hair and 

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:28.920
 the body is a shampoo suitable for everyone 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:30.810
 the types of hair to a sebum action 

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:32.790
 balanced that for me is very important 

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:34.110
 because you know that I certainly do 

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:35.550
 follow in the videos you know me 

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:37.770
 I suffer from dermatitis because I do not lose 

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:39.500
 opportunity to start because I hate her 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:42.480
 an action both juve qui vibrante e 

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:45.120
 nutritious and has an effect on the hair 

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:48.120
 beautiful because it manages to wash them 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:50.190
 very well despite being very much 

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:51.900
 delicate because it contains surfactants of 

00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:54.630
 vegetable origin therefore surfactants 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:56.130
 delicate that do not go to attack the 

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:58.140
 scalp is absolutely not one 

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:59.970
 aggressive chef though being 

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:02.160
 natural while containing excellent 

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:04.290
 ingredients can do very well the 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.980
 hair and makes them super soft and 

00:05:04.290 --> 00:05:07.260
 bright 

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:09.360
 then there is this lipstick of good cost 

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:11.700
 this is called natural slimline in the 

00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:14.340
 exciting coloring and is a lipstick 

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:16.560
 creamy with organic sunflower jojoba oil 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:19.560
 and there was bio data so it has some good ones 

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:21.480
 ingredients and I chose in particular 

00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:23.430
 him because I loved the 

00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:25.530
 color this burgundy threat that 

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:27.990
 because his mind is fixed very high 

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:29.610
 as you know with the dark colors question 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:31.980
 what good is this lipstick 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:34.230
 he too is creamy and contains the oil of 

00:05:31.980 --> 00:05:36.690
 organic sunflower jojoba and organic beeswax 

00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:38.940
 so like the other lipstick and this one 

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:41.100
 time I chose this peach color 

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:42.540
 so a bit more portable color 

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:45.820
 wearable every day I liked it 

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:48.340
 the idea that there was indeed a color 

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:50.470
 very portable like the peach color and a 

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:52.090
 instead darker and therefore maybe more 

00:05:50.470 --> 00:05:54.010
