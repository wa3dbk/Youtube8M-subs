hi<00:00:05.100> there<00:00:05.339> my<00:00:06.089> name<00:00:06.240> is<00:00:06.270> Antonio<00:00:06.810> creator<00:00:07.770> of

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:07.890 
hi there my name is Antonio creator of

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.870 
hi there my name is Antonio creator of
the<00:00:08.250> Bravo<00:00:08.670> Tector<00:00:09.320> iphone<00:00:10.880> silicon

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:11.880 
the Bravo Tector iphone silicon

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:17.029 
the Bravo Tector iphone silicon
character<00:00:12.509> skin<00:00:13.049> and<00:00:13.860> I<00:00:15.350> have<00:00:16.350> designed<00:00:16.740> this

00:00:17.029 --> 00:00:17.039 
character skin and I have designed this

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:20.470 
character skin and I have designed this
because<00:00:17.460> I<00:00:17.670> always<00:00:17.970> thought<00:00:18.119> of<00:00:18.800> having<00:00:19.800> a

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:20.480 
because I always thought of having a

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.429 
because I always thought of having a
cooler<00:00:21.480> or<00:00:22.130> nicer<00:00:23.330> iphone<00:00:24.330> cover<00:00:24.720> so<00:00:24.930> I<00:00:25.170> think

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
cooler or nicer iphone cover so I think

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.080 
cooler or nicer iphone cover so I think
I'd<00:00:25.859> finally<00:00:27.560> got<00:00:28.560> what<00:00:28.949> i<00:00:28.980> was<00:00:29.369> looking<00:00:29.550> for

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
I'd finally got what i was looking for

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:36.139 
I'd finally got what i was looking for
so<00:00:30.390> i'll<00:00:31.289> show<00:00:31.500> you<00:00:31.560> how<00:00:31.650> it<00:00:31.980> works<00:00:33.469> but<00:00:35.149> both

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
so i'll show you how it works but both

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:39.110 
so i'll show you how it works but both
the<00:00:36.870> silicones<00:00:37.350> always<00:00:37.739> a<00:00:37.770> double<00:00:38.550> sided<00:00:38.760> so

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:39.120 
the silicones always a double sided so

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.410 
the silicones always a double sided so
you<00:00:39.180> always<00:00:39.420> worked<00:00:39.870> in<00:00:40.739> either<00:00:40.950> side<00:00:41.420> you

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:42.420 
you always worked in either side you

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:45.190 
you always worked in either side you
make<00:00:42.660> it<00:00:42.870> is<00:00:43.260> always<00:00:43.530> having<00:00:44.520> a<00:00:44.610> cool<00:00:44.820> design

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:45.200 
make it is always having a cool design

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:50.569 
make it is always having a cool design
and<00:00:46.879> this<00:00:47.879> is<00:00:48.180> your<00:00:49.050> regular<00:00:49.440> silicon<00:00:49.950> this<00:00:50.430> is

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
and this is your regular silicon this is

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.209 
and this is your regular silicon this is
like<00:00:50.870> this<00:00:51.870> you<00:00:52.230> will<00:00:52.379> dress<00:00:52.620> in<00:00:52.649> the<00:00:52.860> same<00:00:53.070> way

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
like this you will dress in the same way

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:58.939 
like this you will dress in the same way
you<00:00:53.280> dress<00:00:53.640> with<00:00:54.510> the<00:00:54.800> other<00:00:55.800> silicon<00:00:56.579> so<00:00:57.949> just

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
you dress with the other silicon so just

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:04.070 
you dress with the other silicon so just
put<00:00:59.160> your<00:00:59.340> phone<00:00:59.550> on<00:01:00.890> this<00:01:01.890> is<00:01:02.070> it<00:01:02.930> that's<00:01:03.930> how

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
put your phone on this is it that's how

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.750 
put your phone on this is it that's how
it<00:01:04.110> works

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
it works

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:13.900 
it works
now<00:01:06.330> your<00:01:06.660> phone<00:01:06.900> has<00:01:07.140> a<00:01:07.880> cool<00:01:09.260> character<00:01:10.730> skin

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:13.910 

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:16.910 

and<00:01:14.910> as<00:01:15.390> I<00:01:15.540> said<00:01:15.600> before<00:01:15.810> he<00:01:16.620> works

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
and as I said before he works

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.140 
and as I said before he works
double-sided<00:01:18.620> another<00:01:19.620> cool<00:01:19.920> thing<00:01:19.950> of<00:01:20.790> the

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
double-sided another cool thing of the

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:26.840 
double-sided another cool thing of the
design<00:01:21.540> is<00:01:21.900> that<00:01:22.940> the<00:01:23.940> arms<00:01:24.420> and<00:01:24.630> legs<00:01:25.850> works

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
design is that the arms and legs works

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.660 
design is that the arms and legs works
as<00:01:27.270> a<00:01:27.690> click<00:01:27.930> when<00:01:28.230> you<00:01:28.740> have<00:01:29.160> one<00:01:29.310> have<00:01:29.520> it<00:01:29.610> in

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:35.760 
your pocket this is how it works you can

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:39.740 
your pocket this is how it works you can
use<00:01:35.880> it<00:01:35.910> like<00:01:36.120> that<00:01:36.330> just<00:01:37.230> write<00:01:37.500> that<00:01:38.300> and<00:01:39.300> I

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
use it like that just write that and I

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:43.150 
use it like that just write that and I
said<00:01:40.110> you<00:01:40.590> could<00:01:40.800> always<00:01:40.950> use<00:01:41.250> a<00:01:41.280> double-sided

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:43.160 
said you could always use a double-sided

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:50.780 
said you could always use a double-sided
same<00:01:44.160> way<00:01:44.460> and<00:01:47.150> one<00:01:48.150> thing<00:01:49.020> that<00:01:49.050> also<00:01:49.710> is<00:01:50.550> very

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
same way and one thing that also is very

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.390

nice about it is that you can charge the

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:56.960 
nice about it is that you can charge the
device<00:01:54.320> while<00:01:55.320> it<00:01:55.560> stands<00:01:55.830> it<00:01:56.220> is<00:01:56.460> against<00:01:56.820> the
