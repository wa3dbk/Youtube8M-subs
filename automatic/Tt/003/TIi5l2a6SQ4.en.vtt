00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:19.420 
chips and that was like prime stuff so

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.509 
chips and that was like prime stuff so
you<00:03:19.900> do<00:03:20.170> sometimes<00:03:20.500> have<00:03:20.889> to<00:03:20.980> think<00:03:21.220> outside

00:03:21.509 --> 00:03:21.519 
you do sometimes have to think outside

00:03:21.519 --> 00:03:22.890 
you do sometimes have to think outside
the<00:03:21.549> box<00:03:21.790> when<00:03:22.090> it<00:03:22.180> comes<00:03:22.359> to<00:03:22.480> finding<00:03:22.690> these

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900 
the box when it comes to finding these

00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:26.039 
the box when it comes to finding these
wood<00:03:23.139> chips<00:03:23.379> and<00:03:23.500> the<00:03:23.920> other<00:03:24.129> thing<00:03:24.489> also<00:03:25.049> if

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:26.049 
wood chips and the other thing also if

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:29.580 
wood chips and the other thing also if
you<00:03:26.260> can't<00:03:26.620> find<00:03:27.160> wood<00:03:27.669> chips<00:03:28.060> don't<00:03:28.560> panic

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
you can't find wood chips don't panic

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.039 
you can't find wood chips don't panic
because<00:03:30.340> the<00:03:30.609> whole<00:03:30.819> concept<00:03:31.090> of<00:03:31.540> the<00:03:31.660> back<00:03:31.870> to

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:32.049 
because the whole concept of the back to

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:35.009 
because the whole concept of the back to
in<00:03:32.230> garden<00:03:32.879> method<00:03:33.879> is<00:03:34.090> cover<00:03:34.569> cover<00:03:34.900> cover

00:03:35.009 --> 00:03:35.019 
in garden method is cover cover cover

00:03:35.019 --> 00:03:38.430 
in garden method is cover cover cover
cover<00:03:35.379> which<00:03:36.370> means<00:03:36.699> organic<00:03:37.239> cover<00:03:37.720> so<00:03:38.319> it

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:38.440 
cover which means organic cover so it

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:39.629 
cover which means organic cover so it
doesn't<00:03:38.739> make<00:03:38.829> any<00:03:38.949> difference<00:03:39.040> if<00:03:39.459> it's

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:39.639 
doesn't make any difference if it's

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:44.129 
doesn't make any difference if it's
leaves<00:03:40.060> or<00:03:40.419> grass<00:03:40.590> or<00:03:41.609> needles<00:03:42.609> or<00:03:43.000> straw<00:03:43.750> all

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:44.139 
leaves or grass or needles or straw all

00:03:44.139 --> 00:03:47.849 
leaves or grass or needles or straw all
of<00:03:44.440> that<00:03:44.680> is<00:03:44.980> organic<00:03:45.790> you<00:03:46.629> can<00:03:46.810> use<00:03:47.109> that<00:03:47.440> too

00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:47.859 
of that is organic you can use that too

00:03:47.859 --> 00:03:50.099 
of that is organic you can use that too
so<00:03:48.190> yes<00:03:48.459> the<00:03:48.669> original<00:03:48.879> started<00:03:49.720> with<00:03:49.870> wood

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:26.520 
same clay soil we just started with

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:30.050 
same clay soil we just started with
three<00:05:27.330> years<00:05:27.570> ago<00:05:27.720> so<00:05:28.530> you<00:05:28.590> see<00:05:29.070> people<00:05:29.310> this

is the point that I'm trying to make
throwing<00:05:32.580> down<00:05:32.760> woodchips

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:33.630 
throwing down woodchips

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:40.070 
throwing down woodchips
on<00:05:34.430> just<00:05:35.430> your<00:05:36.030> soil<00:05:36.680> be<00:05:37.680> it<00:05:37.800> a<00:05:38.510> sandy<00:05:39.510> soil<00:05:39.539> a

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:40.080 
on just your soil be it a sandy soil a

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:42.930 
be it clay soil is not going to create a

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:46.850 
be it clay soil is not going to create a
bactine<00:05:43.560> garden<00:05:43.979> okay<00:05:44.310> so<00:05:44.870> forget<00:05:45.870> that<00:05:46.169> just

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:46.860 
bactine garden okay so forget that just

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:49.730 
bactine garden okay so forget that just
remember<00:05:47.430> it<00:05:47.669> there's<00:05:48.510> more<00:05:48.750> to<00:05:49.050> this<00:05:49.229> method

00:05:49.730 --> 00:05:49.740 
remember it there's more to this method

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:53.620 
remember it there's more to this method
there<00:05:50.400> is<00:05:50.610> layering<00:05:51.000> and<00:05:51.479> layering<00:05:52.200> is<00:05:52.979> what

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:53.630 
there is layering and layering is what

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:56.870 
there is layering and layering is what
happens<00:05:54.630> in<00:05:54.900> the<00:05:55.200> hardwood<00:05:55.590> forest<00:05:56.130> when<00:05:56.700> the

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:56.880 
happens in the hardwood forest when the

00:05:56.880 --> 00:06:00.140 
happens in the hardwood forest when the
leaves<00:05:57.120> fall<00:05:57.360> and<00:05:57.870> the<00:05:58.440> needles<00:05:58.889> fall<00:05:59.220> and<00:05:59.550> and

00:06:00.140 --> 00:06:00.150 
leaves fall and the needles fall and and

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:04.189 
leaves fall and the needles fall and and
it<00:06:00.570> creates<00:06:01.260> beautiful<00:06:02.240> enriched<00:06:03.240> soil<00:06:03.750> by

00:06:04.189 --> 00:06:04.199 
it creates beautiful enriched soil by

00:06:04.199 --> 00:06:07.790 
it creates beautiful enriched soil by
what<00:06:04.440> wearing<00:06:05.250> layering<00:06:06.150> so<00:06:06.720> my<00:06:06.960> next<00:06:07.410> video

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:07.800 
what wearing layering so my next video

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:10.850 
what wearing layering so my next video
is<00:06:08.039> going<00:06:08.460> to<00:06:08.610> be<00:06:08.729> addressing<00:06:09.349> how<00:06:10.349> to<00:06:10.410> layer

00:06:10.850 --> 00:06:10.860 
is going to be addressing how to layer

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:13.400 
is going to be addressing how to layer
how<00:06:11.639> would<00:06:11.820> you<00:06:11.910> create<00:06:12.150> that<00:06:12.660> layer<00:06:12.930> effect

00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:13.410 
how would you create that layer effect

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:15.980 
how would you create that layer effect
so<00:06:13.620> you<00:06:13.650> can<00:06:14.280> have<00:06:14.490> a<00:06:14.520> back<00:06:14.910> to<00:06:15.090> Eden<00:06:15.330> garden

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:15.990 
so you can have a back to Eden garden
