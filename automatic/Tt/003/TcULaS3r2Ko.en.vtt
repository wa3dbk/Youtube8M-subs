no<00:03:53.860> but<00:03:54.860> it<00:03:54.980> working<00:03:55.340> it's<00:03:55.459> functional<00:03:55.910> so

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:56.870 
no but it working it's functional so

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:58.750 
no but it working it's functional so
that's<00:03:57.140> the<00:03:57.380> where<00:03:57.500> we<00:03:57.590> are<00:03:57.620> now<00:03:57.920> now<00:03:58.160> where's

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:58.760 
that's the where we are now now where's

00:03:58.760 --> 00:03:59.770 
that's the where we are now now where's
figure<00:03:59.090> out<00:03:59.150> what<00:03:59.239> we're<00:03:59.330> gonna<00:03:59.420> do<00:03:59.540> with<00:03:59.690> the

whenever<00:04:02.510> we<00:04:04.000> just<00:04:05.000> figured<00:04:05.270> out<00:04:05.360> mmm

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:06.500 
whenever we just figured out mmm

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.920 
whenever we just figured out mmm
when<00:04:07.160> we<00:04:07.250> thought<00:04:07.459> it<00:04:07.580> through<00:04:07.610> yeah<00:04:08.030> this<00:04:08.840> is

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:08.930 
when we thought it through yeah this is

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:16.300 
when we thought it through yeah this is
where<00:04:09.050> we<00:04:09.110> are<00:04:09.200> so<00:04:09.350> far<00:04:09.530> guys
