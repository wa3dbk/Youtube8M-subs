hard<00:00:18.510> and<00:00:18.859> III<00:00:19.859> know<00:00:20.250> that<00:00:20.490> we<00:00:20.850> will<00:00:20.939> achieve

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.090 
hard and III know that we will achieve

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.259

our<00:00:21.390> goal<00:00:22.100> Lisa<00:00:23.100> starts<00:00:23.400> very<00:00:23.670> well<00:00:23.850> on<00:00:24.000> on<00:00:24.150> the

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
our goal Lisa starts very well on on the

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.120 
our goal Lisa starts very well on on the
game<00:00:24.420> but<00:00:24.570> then<00:00:24.750> the<00:00:24.930> red<00:00:25.080> card<00:00:25.320> for<00:00:25.410> zoo<00:00:25.740> made

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:26.130 
game but then the red card for zoo made

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.670 
game but then the red card for zoo made
it<00:00:26.250> difficult<00:00:26.699> for<00:00:27.060> you<00:00:27.140> yes<00:00:28.140> of<00:00:28.320> course<00:00:28.529> it's

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
it difficult for you yes of course it's

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.250 
it difficult for you yes of course it's
not<00:00:28.800> easy<00:00:28.980> to<00:00:29.160> play<00:00:29.340> with<00:00:29.869> one<00:00:30.869> less<00:00:31.109> player

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260 
not easy to play with one less player

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:33.709 
not easy to play with one less player
but<00:00:31.619> still<00:00:32.309> I<00:00:32.550> think<00:00:32.610> we've<00:00:33.270> been<00:00:33.360> compacted

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
but still I think we've been compacted

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.380 
but still I think we've been compacted
through<00:00:33.960> the<00:00:34.079> whole<00:00:34.170> game<00:00:34.370> we<00:00:35.370> keep<00:00:35.550> the<00:00:35.730> ball

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
through the whole game we keep the ball

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.020 
through the whole game we keep the ball
good<00:00:36.570> so<00:00:37.290> we<00:00:37.829> create<00:00:38.100> some<00:00:38.280> chances<00:00:38.670> and<00:00:38.730> we

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030 
good so we create some chances and we

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:42.200 
good so we create some chances and we
didn't<00:00:39.379> we<00:00:40.379> didn't<00:00:40.620> give<00:00:41.520> them<00:00:41.670> enough<00:00:41.790> space

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
didn't we didn't give them enough space

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.990 
didn't we didn't give them enough space
to<00:00:42.239> create<00:00:42.870> anything<00:00:43.140> serious<00:00:43.950> so<00:00:44.100> this<00:00:44.820> was

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000 
to create anything serious so this was

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.330 
to create anything serious so this was
probably<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:45.629> most<00:00:45.840> important<00:00:46.379> that<00:00:46.559> that<00:00:46.950> we

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:47.340 
probably the most important that that we

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.869 
probably the most important that that we
did<00:00:47.489> in<00:00:47.610> this<00:00:47.730> game<00:00:48.680> for<00:00:49.680> red<00:00:49.890> card<00:00:50.190> okay<00:00:50.520> it

00:00:50.869 --> 00:00:50.879 
did in this game for red card okay it

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.319 
did in this game for red card okay it
happened<00:00:51.270> because<00:00:51.750> it<00:00:52.559> was<00:00:52.710> twice<00:00:53.219> okay<00:00:54.210> the

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
happened because it was twice okay the

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.840 
happened because it was twice okay the
referee<00:00:54.600> decided<00:00:55.020> to<00:00:55.110> do<00:00:55.770> to<00:00:56.129> give<00:00:56.579> you<00:00:56.670> a<00:00:56.699> look

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
referee decided to do to give you a look

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.360 
referee decided to do to give you a look
two<00:00:57.449> yellow<00:00:57.660> cards<00:00:57.780> but<00:00:58.260> we<00:00:58.800> need<00:00:58.980> to<00:00:59.070> respect

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
two yellow cards but we need to respect

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.540 
two yellow cards but we need to respect
this<00:00:59.520> decision<00:01:00.210> and<00:01:00.440> we've<00:01:01.440> seen<00:01:01.620> we<00:01:02.340> being

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
this decision and we've seen we being

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:03.619 
this decision and we've seen we being
focused<00:01:02.910> through<00:01:03.210> the<00:01:03.270> whole<00:01:03.420> game<00:01:03.449> and

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
focused through the whole game and

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:07.130 
focused through the whole game and
that's<00:01:04.170> why<00:01:04.379> we<00:01:04.439> we<00:01:04.949> want<00:01:05.570> even<00:01:06.570> with<00:01:06.750> 10<00:01:06.930> men

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
that's why we we want even with 10 men

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:10.850 
that's why we we want even with 10 men
you<00:01:08.270> control<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.450> game<00:01:09.600> with<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.380> first<00:01:10.590> goal

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
you control the game with the first goal

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:13.010

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
I think yeah even with her on man we we

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.580 
I think yeah even with her on man we we
keep<00:01:17.580> the<00:01:17.700> ball<00:01:17.820> good<00:01:17.970> and<00:01:18.210> then<00:01:18.659> when<00:01:19.170> this
