okay this game is full of flaws let's
make<00:01:52.470> a<00:01:52.500> new<00:01:52.710> one<00:01:52.860> instead<00:01:53.220> and<00:01:53.520> that's<00:01:54.240> some

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:54.390 
make a new one instead and that's some

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:57.289 
make a new one instead and that's some
of<00:01:54.479> the<00:01:54.509> EA<00:01:55.409> way<00:01:55.799> of<00:01:55.920> thinking<00:01:56.280> as<00:01:56.700> far<00:01:56.969> as<00:01:57.210> i

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
of the EA way of thinking as far as i

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.030 
of the EA way of thinking as far as i
know<00:01:57.360> that<00:01:57.689> instead<00:01:58.259> of<00:01:58.290> trying<00:01:58.530> to<00:01:58.649> fix<00:01:58.890> the

00:01:59.030 --> 00:01:59.040 
know that instead of trying to fix the

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.319 
know that instead of trying to fix the
stuff<00:01:59.219> they<00:01:59.369> make<00:01:59.399> they<00:01:59.759> just<00:01:59.939> make<00:02:00.090> new<00:02:00.299> ones

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:00.329 
stuff they make they just make new ones

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.749 
stuff they make they just make new ones
new<00:02:01.020> products<00:02:01.439> because<00:02:01.799> the<00:02:02.219> new<00:02:02.399> products

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
new products because the new products

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.130 
new products because the new products
you<00:02:02.850> can<00:02:02.909> have<00:02:03.060> to<00:02:03.180> pay<00:02:03.360> for<00:02:03.420> it<00:02:03.659> we<00:02:03.810> don't<00:02:03.899> pay

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
you can have to pay for it we don't pay

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.170 
you can have to pay for it we don't pay
for<00:02:04.350> our<00:02:04.439> passions<00:02:04.890> doing<00:02:05.130> now<00:02:05.340> we<00:02:05.399> don't<00:02:05.640> we

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:06.180 
for our passions doing now we don't we

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:08.600 
for our passions doing now we don't we
pay<00:02:06.360> for<00:02:06.390> the<00:02:06.600> new<00:02:06.689> game<00:02:06.930> so<00:02:07.409> why<00:02:07.979> make<00:02:08.190> tons<00:02:08.520> of

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
pay for the new game so why make tons of

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.520 
pay for the new game so why make tons of
patches<00:02:09.030> that<00:02:09.390> cost<00:02:09.629> tons<00:02:09.840> of<00:02:10.020> money<00:02:10.170> when<00:02:10.500> you

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.530 
patches that cost tons of money when you

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:11.869 
patches that cost tons of money when you
can<00:02:10.649> just<00:02:10.679> make<00:02:11.009> a<00:02:11.039> new<00:02:11.250> game<00:02:11.459> and<00:02:11.670> hopefully

00:02:11.869 --> 00:02:11.879 
can just make a new game and hopefully

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:13.470 
can just make a new game and hopefully
fix<00:02:12.300> those<00:02:12.480> bugs<00:02:12.750> so

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
fix those bugs so

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:15.630 
fix those bugs so
I<00:02:13.510> do<00:02:13.780> hope<00:02:14.230> that<00:02:14.290> I<00:02:14.470> don't<00:02:14.620> introduce<00:02:15.069> too

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:15.640 
I do hope that I don't introduce too

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.460 
I do hope that I don't introduce too
much<00:02:15.909> new<00:02:16.180> in<00:02:16.390> the<00:02:16.540> battlefield<00:02:16.810> 4<00:02:17.080> t.v<00:02:17.230> honest

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
much new in the battlefield 4 t.v honest

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:18.990 
much new in the battlefield 4 t.v honest
because<00:02:17.650> that's<00:02:17.920> can<00:02:18.069> result<00:02:18.370> in<00:02:18.549> more<00:02:18.700> bugs

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:19.000 
because that's can result in more bugs

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.570 
because that's can result in more bugs
that's<00:02:19.269> never<00:02:19.420> gonna<00:02:19.599> be<00:02:19.780> fixed<00:02:19.959> so<00:02:20.680> it's

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
that's never gonna be fixed so it's

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.009 
that's never gonna be fixed so it's
gonna<00:02:21.700> run<00:02:21.879> on<00:02:21.970> the<00:02:22.030> same<00:02:22.239> game<00:02:22.540> engine<00:02:22.810> engine

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:23.019 
gonna run on the same game engine engine

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:26.430 
gonna run on the same game engine engine
as<00:02:23.260> far<00:02:23.440> as<00:02:23.530> I<00:02:23.650> know<00:02:23.709> frostbite<00:02:24.190> you<00:02:24.400> so<00:02:25.440> I'm

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:26.440 
as far as I know frostbite you so I'm

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:27.630 
as far as I know frostbite you so I'm
pretty<00:02:26.620> sure<00:02:26.860> that<00:02:26.980> the<00:02:27.069> game<00:02:27.250> is<00:02:27.400> gonna<00:02:27.549> look

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
pretty sure that the game is gonna look

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.490 
pretty sure that the game is gonna look
fairly<00:02:27.909> the<00:02:28.120> same<00:02:28.330> they<00:02:28.870> might<00:02:29.080> do<00:02:29.260> some

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
fairly the same they might do some

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:31.140 
fairly the same they might do some
graphical<00:02:29.950> twitches<00:02:30.400> but<00:02:30.549> I<00:02:30.580> album<00:02:31.000> I'm

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:31.150 
graphical twitches but I album I'm

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:32.640 
graphical twitches but I album I'm
thinking<00:02:31.390> that<00:02:31.569> most<00:02:31.900> of<00:02:32.019> it's<00:02:32.170> gonna<00:02:32.230> be<00:02:32.410> fun

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:32.650 
thinking that most of it's gonna be fun

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:35.670 
thinking that most of it's gonna be fun
fixes<00:02:33.099> like<00:02:33.450> how<00:02:34.450> the<00:02:34.510> game<00:02:34.810> runs<00:02:35.110> like<00:02:35.470> when

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:35.680 
fixes like how the game runs like when

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.380 
fixes like how the game runs like when
you<00:02:35.769> for<00:02:36.250> example<00:02:36.280> did<00:02:36.819> that<00:02:36.970> issue<00:02:37.120> when<00:02:37.330> you

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:37.390 
you for example did that issue when you

00:02:37.390 --> 00:02:39.210 
you for example did that issue when you
jump<00:02:37.660> over<00:02:37.810> stuff<00:02:38.200> I<00:02:38.410> your<00:02:38.560> body<00:02:38.769> just<00:02:39.010> kind<00:02:39.099> of

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
jump over stuff I your body just kind of

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.640 
jump over stuff I your body just kind of
fungus<00:02:39.879> over<00:02:40.269> it<00:02:40.390> that's<00:02:40.870> one<00:02:41.079> rafiqul<00:02:41.530> each

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:41.650 
fungus over it that's one rafiqul each

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:43.229 
fungus over it that's one rafiqul each
issue<00:02:41.860> that<00:02:42.220> I<00:02:42.250> hope<00:02:42.430> they<00:02:42.579> fix<00:02:42.790> for<00:02:42.940> mountain

00:02:43.229 --> 00:02:43.239 
issue that I hope they fix for mountain

00:02:43.239 --> 00:02:45.990 
issue that I hope they fix for mountain
for<00:02:43.420> for<00:02:43.629> example<00:02:44.049> so<00:02:44.470> like<00:02:44.590> that<00:02:44.709> of<00:02:45.610> course<00:02:45.879> I

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:46.000 
for for example so like that of course I

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.240 
for for example so like that of course I
