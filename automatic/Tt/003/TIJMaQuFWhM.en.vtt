00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:42.810 
thing one drawback to natural reader is

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:44.720 
thing one drawback to natural reader is
sometimes<00:02:43.470> when<00:02:43.650> you<00:02:43.739> import<00:02:44.040> documents

sometimes when you import documents
they'll<00:02:44.970> come<00:02:45.180> out<00:02:45.209> the<00:02:45.569> formatting<00:02:46.140> will<00:02:46.290> be

00:02:46.369 --> 00:02:46.379 
they'll come out the formatting will be

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:48.650 
they'll come out the formatting will be
a<00:02:46.410> little<00:02:46.620> bit<00:02:46.799> strange<00:02:47.220> such<00:02:48.090> that<00:02:48.359> it<00:02:48.480> won't

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:48.660 
a little bit strange such that it won't

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:50.420 
a little bit strange such that it won't
read<00:02:48.900> pop<00:02:49.140> properly<00:02:49.709> so<00:02:49.890> if<00:02:49.980> you<00:02:50.040> tried<00:02:50.310> to
