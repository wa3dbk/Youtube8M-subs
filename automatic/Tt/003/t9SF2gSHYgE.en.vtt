00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.499
 one of the three indispensable anatomical structures 

00:00:09.499 --> 00:00:11.659
 for good nasal breathing 

00:00:11.659 --> 00:00:16.519
 beyond the septum that is born the nasal valve that is not too narrow are 

00:00:16.519 --> 00:00:18.210
 of the inferior turbinates 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.630
 who are the worry of so many people who are forced to live for rhinitis 

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.260
 allergic or various types of situations 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.499
 to say spraying drugs inside the nose 

00:00:28.499 --> 00:00:31.699
 they compress that they reduce the blood so called vasoconstrictors 

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:37.810
 in 1997 I created a method I called unict 

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.220
 that much in a few minutes to 

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:43.810
 check to resize 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:46.970
 the volume of the turbinates so that it is 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:50.240
 predictable and definitive 

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:54.780
 this for going a little bit to solve what were the problems 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.190
 of the methods still more present on the market 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.380
 which are all based on abuterization cauterization 

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:05.470
 schuller heat the mole part of the turbine 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:10.750
 an important parenthesis dentists have understood for many years that when 

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.460
 must pass a gum 

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.700
 if they did it with laser apple electrosurgery the problem 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.860
 it recurred more than before within a few months 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:22.659
 unfortunately in our field they are still not used 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:24.190
 appropriate techniques 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:27.210
 lamette said this problem solved because 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:32.640
 goes to remodel the lower turbinate in all three of its components 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.900
 what are the inferior turbinates are bony lamellae 

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:37.539
 inside the nose 

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:42.539
 coated with a tissue that collects blood that is used to heat and filter 

00:01:42.539 --> 00:01:43.470
 the air 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.180
 when there are pathological situations in progress they become particularly enlarged 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.390
 the night here is that license tells us that the night is hard to breathe and opens the 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:53.270
 mouth 

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:54.189
 and therefore 

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:56.740
 if this severe respiratory deficit 

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.330
 7 moved his life in 7 minutes 

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.570
 inci d love opens very ruined 

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:03.830
 let's make 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.930
 we lay bare the host part of the turbinate 

00:02:10.159 --> 00:02:15.379
 once stripped no we only reduce we reduce the intermediate part or the 

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:17.599
 cavernous mucus tissue 

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:18.790
 and at the end 

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.289
 ricucci I love the turbine with all its length 

00:02:22.289 --> 00:02:25.599
 thus avoiding bleeding by avoiding tampons 

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:30.420
 this is the only method currently available to have a result 

00:02:30.419 --> 00:02:35.499
 definitive without pain without tampons essence hemorrhage
