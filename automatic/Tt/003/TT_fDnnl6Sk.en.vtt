00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.000 

now<00:00:00.240> I<00:00:00.299> mentioned<00:00:00.659> two<00:00:00.810> basic<00:00:01.199> exercises<00:00:01.650> and

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:02.010 
now I mentioned two basic exercises and

00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:03.590 
now I mentioned two basic exercises and
we<00:00:02.129> first<00:00:02.399> looked<00:00:02.610> at<00:00:02.669> the<00:00:02.820> push-up<00:00:03.149> position

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:03.600 
we first looked at the push-up position

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:05.450 
we first looked at the push-up position
so<00:00:04.080> now<00:00:04.230> what<00:00:04.410> we'll<00:00:04.529> do<00:00:04.680> is<00:00:04.710> we'll<00:00:04.950> invert

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:05.460 
so now what we'll do is we'll invert

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.099 
so now what we'll do is we'll invert
that<00:00:05.490> position<00:00:06.180> because<00:00:06.720> in<00:00:06.810> the<00:00:06.899> push-up

00:00:07.099 --> 00:00:07.109 
that position because in the push-up

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:08.990 
that position because in the push-up
position<00:00:07.350> the<00:00:07.740> load<00:00:07.919> is<00:00:08.099> coming<00:00:08.250> from<00:00:08.550> my<00:00:08.760> body

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:09.000 
position the load is coming from my body

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.580 
position the load is coming from my body
and<00:00:09.360> from<00:00:10.080> my<00:00:10.559> stomach<00:00:11.400> and<00:00:11.900> center<00:00:12.900> and<00:00:13.080> when

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:13.590 
and from my stomach and center and when

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:14.990 
and from my stomach and center and when
I<00:00:13.620> invert<00:00:14.040> that<00:00:14.219> position<00:00:14.639> and<00:00:14.759> I'm<00:00:14.849> in<00:00:14.969> a

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:15.000 
I invert that position and I'm in a

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.630 
I invert that position and I'm in a
hollow<00:00:15.269> body<00:00:15.509> position<00:00:16.199> on<00:00:16.590> my<00:00:16.740> back<00:00:16.980> the<00:00:17.460> load

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640 
hollow body position on my back the load

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.460 
hollow body position on my back the load
is<00:00:17.850> now<00:00:17.970> coming<00:00:18.240> from<00:00:18.510> my<00:00:18.750> arms<00:00:19.170> in<00:00:19.350> my

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
is now coming from my arms in my

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.290 
is now coming from my arms in my
extremities<00:00:19.830> and<00:00:20.310> so<00:00:20.880> it's<00:00:21.029> slightly

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
extremities and so it's slightly

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.420 
extremities and so it's slightly
different<00:00:21.660> and<00:00:21.990> we're<00:00:22.380> learning<00:00:22.470> how<00:00:22.740> to<00:00:22.800> move

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:23.430 
different and we're learning how to move

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.099 
different and we're learning how to move
our<00:00:23.580> body<00:00:23.820> in<00:00:24.150> a<00:00:24.330> different<00:00:24.660> position<00:00:24.810> and

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
our body in a different position and

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:26.779 
our body in a different position and
have<00:00:25.260> control<00:00:25.619> of<00:00:25.680> it<00:00:25.859> in<00:00:26.250> an<00:00:26.519> isometric

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
have control of it in an isometric

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:28.700 
have control of it in an isometric
position<00:00:27.449> so<00:00:27.720> we're<00:00:28.170> gonna<00:00:28.260> look<00:00:28.470> at<00:00:28.590> that

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
position so we're gonna look at that

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:37.069 
position so we're gonna look at that
hollow<00:00:28.920> body<00:00:29.130> hold<00:00:29.220> right<00:00:29.550> now<00:00:35.899> the<00:00:36.899> hollow

00:00:37.069 --> 00:00:37.079 
hollow body hold right now the hollow

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.040 
hollow body hold right now the hollow
body<00:00:37.350> hold<00:00:37.469> is<00:00:37.800> here<00:00:38.040> with<00:00:38.190> my<00:00:38.340> back<00:00:38.550> flat<00:00:39.050> my

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
body hold is here with my back flat my

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.470 
body hold is here with my back flat my
chin<00:00:40.320> is<00:00:40.469> up<00:00:40.680> in<00:00:40.800> a<00:00:40.890> neutral<00:00:41.040> position<00:00:41.670> and<00:00:41.820> the

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:42.480 
chin is up in a neutral position and the

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.940 
chin is up in a neutral position and the
arms<00:00:42.930> are<00:00:43.230> right<00:00:43.469> by<00:00:43.680> my<00:00:43.860> ears<00:00:44.100> here<00:00:44.930> and<00:00:45.950> this

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
arms are right by my ears here and this

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.580 
arms are right by my ears here and this
is<00:00:47.100> an<00:00:47.219> exercise<00:00:47.460> just<00:00:47.640> within<00:00:48.149> itself

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:48.590 
is an exercise just within itself

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.439 
is an exercise just within itself
maintaining<00:00:49.590> it<00:00:49.710> for<00:00:50.000> you<00:00:51.000> know<00:00:51.120> thirty

00:00:51.439 --> 00:00:51.449 
maintaining it for you know thirty

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.209 
maintaining it for you know thirty
seconds<00:00:51.989> or<00:00:52.110> a<00:00:52.170> minute<00:00:52.289> whatever<00:00:53.070> you're

00:00:53.209 --> 00:00:53.219 
seconds or a minute whatever you're

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:54.860 
seconds or a minute whatever you're
capable<00:00:53.370> of<00:00:53.670> doing<00:00:53.969> and<00:00:54.120> then<00:00:54.629> we<00:00:54.750> slowly

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870 
capable of doing and then we slowly

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.290 
capable of doing and then we slowly
start<00:00:55.260> to<00:00:55.320> add<00:00:55.469> rocking<00:00:55.949> to<00:00:56.129> this<00:00:56.250> position<00:00:56.699> we

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
start to add rocking to this position we

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.849 
start to add rocking to this position we
add<00:00:57.329> tucking<00:00:57.960> but<00:00:58.910> the<00:00:59.910> key<00:01:00.149> is<00:01:00.300> first<00:01:01.050> making

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
add tucking but the key is first making

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.860 
add tucking but the key is first making
sure<00:01:02.100> that<00:01:02.219> you<00:01:02.309> have<00:01:02.460> a<00:01:02.489> nice<00:01:02.640> flat<00:01:02.940> back<00:01:03.149> just

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:03.870 
sure that you have a nice flat back just

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.630 
sure that you have a nice flat back just
like<00:01:04.049> that<00:01:04.559> pushup<00:01:04.979> we<00:01:05.129> didn't<00:01:05.369> start<00:01:05.489> off

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
like that pushup we didn't start off

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.310 
like that pushup we didn't start off
with<00:01:05.820> motion<00:01:06.180> we<00:01:06.299> just<00:01:06.479> started<00:01:06.689> off<00:01:06.810> by

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:07.320 
with motion we just started off by

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.250 
with motion we just started off by
maintaining<00:01:07.830> a<00:01:08.130> good<00:01:08.460> solid<00:01:08.700> position<00:01:09.260> sort

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
maintaining a good solid position sort

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.440 
maintaining a good solid position sort
of<00:01:10.350> a<00:01:10.409> rule<00:01:10.560> of<00:01:10.710> thumb<00:01:10.860> is<00:01:11.040> if<00:01:11.070> if<00:01:11.400> you<00:01:11.640> can<00:01:12.210> hold

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
of a rule of thumb is if if you can hold

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.780 
of a rule of thumb is if if you can hold
that<00:01:12.600> position<00:01:12.780> for<00:01:13.049> a<00:01:13.560> minute<00:01:14.040> and<00:01:14.490> it's

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
that position for a minute and it's

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.800 
that position for a minute and it's
pretty<00:01:14.970> easy<00:01:15.060> and<00:01:15.570> you<00:01:15.689> can<00:01:15.900> not<00:01:16.619> have<00:01:17.280> any

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:17.810 
pretty easy and you can not have any

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:20.870 
pretty easy and you can not have any
shaking<00:01:18.810> it's<00:01:19.140> just<00:01:19.350> very<00:01:19.470> solid<00:01:20.040> then<00:01:20.520> you're

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
shaking it's just very solid then you're

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.429 
shaking it's just very solid then you're
really<00:01:21.030> ready<00:01:21.299> to<00:01:21.390> start<00:01:21.509> adding<00:01:21.840> movement<00:01:22.110> to

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
really ready to start adding movement to

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:23.990 
really ready to start adding movement to
it<00:01:22.560> if<00:01:22.680> you're<00:01:23.100> holding<00:01:23.369> it<00:01:23.460> for<00:01:23.640> like<00:01:23.759> 20

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
it if you're holding it for like 20

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.580 
it if you're holding it for like 20
seconds<00:01:24.570> and<00:01:24.720> you<00:01:24.840> start<00:01:25.080> to<00:01:25.140> add<00:01:25.259> movement

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:25.590 
seconds and you start to add movement

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:26.780 
seconds and you start to add movement
what<00:01:26.100> you're<00:01:26.220> going<00:01:26.340> to<00:01:26.369> do<00:01:26.549> is<00:01:26.670> you're<00:01:26.759> going

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
what you're going to do is you're going

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.340 
what you're going to do is you're going
to<00:01:26.909> start<00:01:27.060> to<00:01:27.240> fire<00:01:27.479> smaller<00:01:27.900> muscle<00:01:28.320> groups

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
to start to fire smaller muscle groups

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:30.890 
to start to fire smaller muscle groups
to<00:01:29.130> help<00:01:29.310> engage<00:01:29.490> and<00:01:30.119> get<00:01:30.360> this<00:01:30.540> thing<00:01:30.720> to

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:30.900 
to help engage and get this thing to

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.380 
to help engage and get this thing to
move<00:01:31.110> but<00:01:31.500> if<00:01:31.619> you<00:01:31.710> do<00:01:31.920> that<00:01:32.240> you're<00:01:33.240> going<00:01:33.360> to

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
move but if you do that you're going to

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.149 
move but if you do that you're going to
have<00:01:33.540> trouble<00:01:33.659> with<00:01:33.840> the<00:01:33.990> harder<00:01:34.320> body<00:01:34.979> weight

00:01:35.149 --> 00:01:35.159 
have trouble with the harder body weight

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:36.710 
have trouble with the harder body weight
training<00:01:35.430> skills<00:01:35.790> so<00:01:36.299> you<00:01:36.360> really<00:01:36.600> should

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:36.720 
training skills so you really should

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:39.020 
training skills so you really should
have<00:01:36.750> a<00:01:36.869> very<00:01:37.049> solid<00:01:37.409> core<00:01:38.250> and<00:01:38.280> isometric

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
have a very solid core and isometric

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.450 
have a very solid core and isometric
position<00:01:39.479> which<00:01:40.020> to<00:01:40.229> build<00:01:40.380> from<00:01:40.680> and<00:01:40.890> then<00:01:41.340> we

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
position which to build from and then we

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.190 
position which to build from and then we
can<00:01:41.579> start<00:01:41.790> adding<00:01:41.939> movement<00:01:42.150> but<00:01:42.869> right<00:01:43.020> now

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
can start adding movement but right now

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.719 
can start adding movement but right now
we're<00:01:43.409> going<00:01:43.500> to<00:01:43.560> show<00:01:43.740> you<00:01:43.770> how<00:01:44.250> to<00:01:44.310> get<00:01:44.549> that
