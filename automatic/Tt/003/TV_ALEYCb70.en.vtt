00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:38.060 
actually I have one very almost dropped

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:58.270 

I<00:05:55.720> think<00:05:56.720> graphics<00:05:57.260> or<00:05:57.530> the<00:05:57.560> details<00:05:58.100> are

00:05:58.270 --> 00:05:58.280 
I think graphics or the details are

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:01.050 
I think graphics or the details are
actually<00:05:58.550> really<00:05:58.880> big<00:05:59.120> on<00:05:59.270> that<00:05:59.530> sinner<00:06:00.530> dodge

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:01.060

actually really big on that sinner dodge
simul<00:06:02.060> each<00:06:02.930> often<00:06:03.290> that<00:06:03.560> tree<00:06:04.720> that's<00:06:05.720> not

00:06:05.890 --> 00:06:05.900 
simul each often that tree that's not

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:07.480 
simul each often that tree that's not
really<00:06:06.110> what<00:06:06.290> fits<00:06:06.590> the<00:06:06.740> inside<00:06:06.980> of<00:06:07.100> a<00:06:07.130> foundry

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:07.490 
really what fits the inside of a foundry

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:18.100 
really what fits the inside of a foundry
looks<00:06:07.700> like<00:06:07.880> a<00:06:08.090> doll<00:06:08.300> but<00:06:16.810> don't<00:06:17.810> take<00:06:17.900> a<00:06:17.960> look

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:18.110 
looks like a doll but don't take a look

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:24.240 
looks like a doll but don't take a look
at<00:06:18.230> this<00:06:18.380> others<00:06:18.680> the<00:06:19.400> engine
