00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:06.839
 or the people of the apostate we are today 

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.970
 presenting the twin rocker two 

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:11.700
 rocker accessories twin the kit 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:14.309
 catamaran and the float kit this 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:17.580
 to also bring the possibility of a 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:20.939
 engine mirror we see that it is very fast 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.350
 of arming in the cases of the catamaran and the 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:25.100
 trimaran 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:28.920
 it's very easy if you have systems of 

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:31.950
 quick anchoring which are systems that 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.920
 jump out of the aluminum pipe so that 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:39.320
 get fast in the kayak 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:39.320
 the possibility of it is very versatile 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:45.020
 that shows that right away you can 

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:47.810
 be in the water with a very boat 

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:49.910
 stable and the possibility of placing a 

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:52.550
 engine 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:55.790
 that gives us a lot of comfort if 

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:59.629
 we want to use it for fishing or for 

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:02.059
 walking recreation in both cases is 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:04.760
 Very stable dialing without always being 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:07.310
 more stable the catamaran but the 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:11.240
 trimaran for a single person gives you the 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:13.250
 possibility of stopping and not having a 

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.229
 very wide mobility within the 

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:18.320
 boat being a single kayak and 

00:01:15.229 --> 00:01:21.080
 only adding floats and without 

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:23.650
 also be able to use an engine 

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:28.820
 The engines that we recommend are 

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:32.510
 33 hp in the case of the catamaran in the 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:34.820
 trimaran if possible the use of 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:37.490
 an electric motor if that explosion was 

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:40.010
 it is not recommended to use it at all 

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:45.800
 machine because it 's for simple mobility 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:48.440
 in cases of fishing or comfort for the 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:51.410
 recreation is not a boat none of 

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:53.229
 the two cases are two houses is a kayak 

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:56.090
 let's say that with the possibility of 

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:58.130
 put a catamaran kit for 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.690
 use it with very good stability and 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.090
 with engine 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:04.640
 or the possibility of using it as 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:07.880
