00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
subscribers so let's jump into this you

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:56.380 
subscribers so let's jump into this you
want<00:00:53.610> to<00:00:53.670> use<00:00:53.730> standard<00:00:54.570> tuning<00:00:54.899> for<00:00:55.140> this<00:00:55.289> and

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.390 
want to use standard tuning for this and

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.119 
want to use standard tuning for this and
there<00:00:57.390> are<00:00:57.510> all<00:00:57.629> Studio<00:00:58.050> players<00:00:58.440> man<00:00:58.770> and

there are all Studio players man and

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.119 
there are all Studio players man and
