Sango that is Java C and I am going to

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.660 
Sango that is Java C and I am going to
allow<00:01:28.229> it<00:01:28.350> to<00:01:28.500> cook<00:01:28.619> for<00:01:28.680> about<00:01:28.950> just<00:01:29.100> 5

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
allow it to cook for about just 5

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.760 
allow it to cook for about just 5
minutes<00:01:30.060> I<00:01:30.240> am<00:01:30.270> going<00:01:30.750> to<00:01:30.930> cook<00:01:31.380> it<00:01:31.590> with<00:01:31.619> the

lid closed always allow some gap for the

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.490 
lid closed always allow some gap for the
steam<00:01:35.909> to<00:01:35.939> escape<00:01:36.119> or<00:01:36.630> else<00:01:36.780> it<00:01:36.900> will<00:01:37.020> spill

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
steam to escape or else it will spill

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.069 
steam to escape or else it will spill
out<00:01:37.710> so<00:01:38.430> after<00:01:38.759> 5<00:01:39.030> minutes<00:01:39.240> I<00:01:39.509> am<00:01:39.540> going<00:01:39.630> to<00:01:39.900> add

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
out so after 5 minutes I am going to add

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:42.800 
out so after 5 minutes I am going to add
the<00:01:40.320> 100<00:01:40.710> grams<00:01:40.950> of<00:01:41.189> roasted<00:01:41.759> moong<00:01:42.030> dal<00:01:42.299> so

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
the 100 grams of roasted moong dal so

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.870 
the 100 grams of roasted moong dal so
moong<00:01:42.990> dal<00:01:43.200> will<00:01:43.320> also<00:01:43.680> take<00:01:43.950> some<00:01:44.460> more<00:01:44.640> time

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
moong dal will also take some more time

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.490 
moong dal will also take some more time
to<00:01:45.090> get<00:01:45.270> cooked<00:01:45.540> so<00:01:45.780> that's<00:01:45.960> the<00:01:46.110> reason<00:01:46.380> I'm

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:46.500 
to get cooked so that's the reason I'm

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.960 
to get cooked so that's the reason I'm
going<00:01:46.829> to<00:01:46.979> cook<00:01:47.220> both<00:01:47.460> of<00:01:47.729> them

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:47.970 
going to cook both of them

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.440 
going to cook both of them
simultaneously<00:01:48.979> so<00:01:49.979> this<00:01:50.880> will<00:01:51.060> need<00:01:51.270> around

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
simultaneously so this will need around

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.440 
simultaneously so this will need around
about<00:01:51.810> 20<00:01:52.200> to<00:01:52.320> 25<00:01:52.649> minutes<00:01:52.890> to<00:01:53.729> get<00:01:54.030> the<00:01:54.240> moong

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
about 20 to 25 minutes to get the moong

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.319 
about 20 to 25 minutes to get the moong
dhal<00:01:54.630> cook<00:01:54.990> very<00:01:55.259> softly<00:01:55.979> in<00:01:56.100> a<00:01:56.219> saucepan<00:01:56.790> but

00:01:57.319 --> 00:01:57.329 
dhal cook very softly in a saucepan but

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:58.819 
dhal cook very softly in a saucepan but
if<00:01:57.450> you<00:01:57.570> are<00:01:57.630> using<00:01:57.810> a<00:01:57.990> pressure<00:01:58.229> cooker<00:01:58.469> it

00:01:58.819 --> 00:01:58.829 
if you are using a pressure cooker it

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:00.950 
if you are using a pressure cooker it
will<00:01:59.009> get<00:01:59.189> cooked<00:01:59.490> in<00:01:59.700> less<00:02:00.329> than<00:02:00.479> 5<00:02:00.750> minutes

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960 
will get cooked in less than 5 minutes

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.539 
will get cooked in less than 5 minutes
it<00:02:01.200> will<00:02:01.290> need<00:02:01.409> only<00:02:01.619> 1<00:02:02.009> whistle<00:02:02.399> in<00:02:02.520> the

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
it will need only 1 whistle in the

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:04.789 
it will need only 1 whistle in the
pressure<00:02:02.909> cooker<00:02:03.000> so<00:02:03.930> here<00:02:04.259> also<00:02:04.439> always

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
pressure cooker so here also always

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.280 
pressure cooker so here also always
allow<00:02:05.340> gap<00:02:05.850> for<00:02:06.240> the<00:02:06.329> steam<00:02:06.570> to<00:02:06.750> escape<00:02:06.780> or

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:07.290 
allow gap for the steam to escape or

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:09.440 
allow gap for the steam to escape or
else<00:02:07.439> it<00:02:07.530> will<00:02:07.649> spill<00:02:08.039> out<00:02:08.220> now<00:02:08.849> you<00:02:08.910> can<00:02:09.209> see

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
else it will spill out now you can see

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.390 
else it will spill out now you can see
the<00:02:09.869> moong<00:02:10.080> dal<00:02:10.259> is<00:02:10.410> cooked<00:02:10.470> well<00:02:10.860> it<00:02:11.039> took<00:02:11.250> me

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:14.430 
around about 23 minutes now you can see
it<00:02:13.950> is<00:02:14.069> very

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
it is very

Sein Mongol is cooked well so also note

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:21.330 
Sein Mongol is cooked well so also note
the<00:02:19.480> consistency<00:02:20.170> it<00:02:20.230> should<00:02:20.290> be<00:02:20.530> thick<00:02:21.100> like

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.340 
the consistency it should be thick like

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:22.710 
the consistency it should be thick like
this<00:02:21.550> it<00:02:21.700> should<00:02:21.820> not<00:02:21.910> be<00:02:22.090> very<00:02:22.270> dilute

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:22.720 
this it should not be very dilute

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:24.870 
this it should not be very dilute
because<00:02:23.050> we<00:02:23.230> have<00:02:23.350> to<00:02:23.530> add<00:02:23.710> more<00:02:24.130> coconut<00:02:24.520> milk

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
because we have to add more coconut milk

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.150 
because we have to add more coconut milk
it<00:02:25.030> will<00:02:25.060> more<00:02:25.300> dilute<00:02:25.750> the<00:02:25.930> pious<00:02:26.260> M<00:02:26.440> so<00:02:26.950> make

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
it will more dilute the pious M so make

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.370 
it will more dilute the pious M so make
sure<00:02:27.190> tis<00:02:27.580> in<00:02:27.760> the<00:02:27.910> right<00:02:28.300> thick<00:02:28.630> consistency

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
sure tis in the right thick consistency

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.200 
sure tis in the right thick consistency
also<00:02:29.620> make<00:02:29.980> sure<00:02:30.010> it<00:02:30.250> does<00:02:30.400> not<00:02:30.580> burn<00:02:30.820> in<00:02:31.060> the

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:31.210 
also make sure it does not burn in the

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:34.200 
also make sure it does not burn in the
bottom<00:02:31.750> I<00:02:31.900> used<00:02:32.530> another<00:02:32.770> 1<00:02:33.340> cup<00:02:33.580> of<00:02:33.760> water<00:02:34.000> in

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:34.210 
bottom I used another 1 cup of water in

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:35.490 
bottom I used another 1 cup of water in
the<00:02:34.360> middle<00:02:34.510> to<00:02:34.840> maintain<00:02:35.200> the<00:02:35.320> right

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:35.500 
the middle to maintain the right

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:37.890 
the middle to maintain the right
consistency<00:02:36.310> do<00:02:36.790> check<00:02:37.060> it<00:02:37.270> in<00:02:37.420> the<00:02:37.570> middle

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:37.900 
consistency do check it in the middle

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:40.380 
consistency do check it in the middle
when<00:02:38.440> you<00:02:38.560> cook<00:02:38.710> for<00:02:38.890> 20<00:02:39.220> minutes<00:02:39.250> now<00:02:39.700> I<00:02:40.150> have

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.720 
added the 200 grams of crushed jaggery
pieces<00:02:43.780> and<00:02:43.990> allow<00:02:44.560> it<00:02:44.740> to<00:02:44.770> dissolve<00:02:45.430> well

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730 
pieces and allow it to dissolve well

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:47.910 
pieces and allow it to dissolve well
once<00:02:46.240> it<00:02:46.480> dissolves<00:02:46.990> it<00:02:47.260> will<00:02:47.410> change<00:02:47.680> the
