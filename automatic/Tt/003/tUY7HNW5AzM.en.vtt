now<00:04:28.270> it's<00:04:28.450> time<00:04:28.570> to<00:04:28.750> just<00:04:28.930> go

00:05:11.589 --> 00:05:11.599 

00:05:11.599 --> 00:05:31.320 

really<00:05:12.599> stuck<00:05:18.199> in<00:05:19.199> the<00:05:19.499> clutch<00:05:19.740> don't<00:05:20.099> help

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:31.330 

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:33.490 

well<00:05:32.330> we

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:33.500 
well we

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:35.890 
well we
analyze<00:05:34.010> the<00:05:34.250> situation<00:05:34.460> and<00:05:35.120> we<00:05:35.240> determined

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:35.900 
analyze the situation and we determined

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:37.960 
analyze the situation and we determined
that<00:05:35.960> we<00:05:36.200> just<00:05:36.440> discard<00:05:36.920> the<00:05:37.100> whole<00:05:37.280> thing<00:05:37.610> so

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:37.970 
that we just discard the whole thing so

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:40.570 
that we just discard the whole thing so
what<00:05:38.900> you<00:05:39.050> saw<00:05:39.290> was<00:05:39.590> the<00:05:39.740> end<00:05:39.920> of<00:05:40.100> it<00:05:40.160> that's

what you saw was the end of it that's

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:43.270
