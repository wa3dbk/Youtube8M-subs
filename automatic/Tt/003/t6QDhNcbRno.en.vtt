00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
some reason it turned out looking all

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:14.640 
some reason it turned out looking all
odd<00:02:10.380> like<00:02:11.380> that<00:02:13.020> but<00:02:14.020> you<00:02:14.140> can<00:02:14.320> see<00:02:14.500> the

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:14.650 
odd like that but you can see the

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.770 
odd like that but you can see the
streaks<00:02:15.010> of<00:02:15.310> what<00:02:15.520> would<00:02:16.030> like<00:02:16.210> the<00:02:16.390> marker

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:16.780 
streaks of what would like the marker

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:19.560 
streaks of what would like the marker
was<00:02:17.320> rough<00:02:17.620> and<00:02:18.190> stuff<00:02:18.460> so<00:02:19.000> it<00:02:19.090> looks<00:02:19.210> pretty

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:19.570 
was rough and stuff so it looks pretty

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:22.860 
was rough and stuff so it looks pretty

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:36.110 
they're a lot like I said I lost it
somewhere<00:04:32.700> I'm<00:04:33.120> gonna<00:04:33.360> buy<00:04:34.080> it<00:04:34.110> I<00:04:34.970> know<00:04:35.970> my

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.120 
somewhere I'm gonna buy it I know my

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:39.379 
somewhere I'm gonna buy it I know my
body<00:04:36.330> I<00:04:36.510> guess<00:04:36.720> it's<00:04:36.960> just<00:04:37.020> because<00:04:37.200> and<00:04:38.389> just

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:39.389 
body I guess it's just because and just

00:04:39.389 --> 00:04:41.450 
body I guess it's just because and just
trying<00:04:39.870> to<00:04:39.960> stay<00:04:40.110> loyal<00:04:40.320> to<00:04:40.590> the<00:04:40.860> franchise<00:04:41.250> as

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:41.460 
trying to stay loyal to the franchise as

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:44.360 
trying to stay loyal to the franchise as
possible<00:04:42.530> regardless<00:04:43.530> of<00:04:43.710> its<00:04:43.830> dying<00:04:44.070> or<00:04:44.250> not

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:44.370 
possible regardless of its dying or not

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:47.360 
possible regardless of its dying or not
so<00:04:44.700> I<00:04:44.930> guess<00:04:45.930> that's<00:04:46.169> my<00:04:46.410> only<00:04:46.440> logical<00:04:47.070> reason

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.370 
so I guess that's my only logical reason

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:49.550 
so I guess that's my only logical reason
for<00:04:47.400> buying<00:04:47.700> it<00:04:48.000> but<00:04:48.840> I<00:04:48.900> pretty<00:04:49.199> much<00:04:49.289> was

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560 
for buying it but I pretty much was

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:54.920 
for buying it but I pretty much was
looking<00:04:49.830> for<00:04:50.389> alien<00:04:51.389> movies<00:04:51.750> I<00:04:53.539> did<00:04:54.539> I<00:04:54.750> did

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:54.930 
looking for alien movies I did I did

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:57.560 
looking for alien movies I did I did

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:10.690 
be doing the forearm I think or I could
do<00:07:08.270> the<00:07:08.390> whole<00:07:08.420> arm<00:07:08.810> or<00:07:09.740> the<00:07:10.010> whole<00:07:10.160> one<00:07:10.400> side

00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:14.180 
of the arm because it does require some

00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:18.310 
of the arm because it does require some
