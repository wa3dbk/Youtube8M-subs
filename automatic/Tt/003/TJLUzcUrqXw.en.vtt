open cabin it's a change of pace for the
team<00:00:31.949> but<00:00:32.520> functionally<00:00:33.059> it's<00:00:33.570> built<00:00:33.809> to<00:00:33.930> do

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050 
team but functionally it's built to do

team but functionally it's built to do
the<00:00:34.200> job<00:00:34.410> so<00:00:35.190> the<00:00:35.340> c-130<00:00:35.790> it's<00:00:36.030> a<00:00:36.180> it's<00:00:36.360> an

us<00:00:38.550> is<00:00:38.730> important<00:00:39.030> is<00:00:39.090> a<00:00:39.149> new<00:00:39.360> airplane<00:00:39.750> it's

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
us is important is a new airplane it's

first time is hard and that's what's

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.050 
first time is hard and that's what's
been<00:01:28.650> an<00:01:28.920> issue<00:01:29.009> with<00:01:29.850> this<00:01:29.909> particular
