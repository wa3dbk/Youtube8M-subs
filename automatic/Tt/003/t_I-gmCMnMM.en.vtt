00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:13.900

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:19.540
 of medical play 3 

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:22.529
 here we are in part number 2 mission 

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:22.529
 number 2 

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:31.210
 Brigadier General Arnold sends me to 

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:31.210
 help 

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:34.920
 he is the boss 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:38.460
 to see what I have to do 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:46.199
 cut the patriots some time 

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:50.460
 look closely I do not think I could carry 

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:52.320
 boxes after Accordingly 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:54.269
 is the joke 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.949
 we have to join us in west point and 

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:58.379
 by extension protect the hudson 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.059
 hospital that's clear because we 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.979
 we get rid of half of our bullets 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:05.790
 gunpowder because he does not move his 

00:01:01.979 --> 00:01:07.530
 concern to the general dart I did it and 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.570
 threatens as a court martial for and 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.090
 subordination and betrayal although it sounds 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:14.899
 incredible so I keep orders by 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:14.899
 is absurd 

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.640
 well it's here next I 'm not going to either 

00:01:17.789 --> 00:01:22.630
 take a long time 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:22.630
 today, I'm in a mess 

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.630
 the traitor escapes is supposed to be 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.630
 on this boat 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:39.600
 traitor 

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:44.119
 is full of pussy traitors 

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:44.119
 modern that runs we go with him 

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:48.920
 our who kills do not think I do not 

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:52.600
 because you do not get a symbol in red 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.600
 do not tell me to capture them for what 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.590

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.850
