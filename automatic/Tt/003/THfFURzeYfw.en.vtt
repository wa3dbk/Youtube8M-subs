the<00:00:39.030> brim<00:00:39.660> like<00:00:39.870> this<00:00:40.160> upside<00:00:41.160> down<00:00:41.190> would<00:00:41.610> be

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
the brim like this upside down would be

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.030 
the brim like this upside down would be
good<00:00:41.940> okay<00:00:42.480> a<00:00:42.660> lot<00:00:42.870> of<00:00:43.020> cowboys<00:00:43.410> know<00:00:43.620> that<00:00:43.860> you

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:44.040 
good okay a lot of cowboys know that you

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.940 
good okay a lot of cowboys know that you
always<00:00:44.160> see<00:00:44.420> Cowboys<00:00:45.420> putting<00:00:45.780> their<00:00:45.950> cowboy

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
always see Cowboys putting their cowboy

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:48.470 
always see Cowboys putting their cowboy
hats<00:00:47.280> upside<00:00:47.670> down<00:00:47.850> on<00:00:48.030> the<00:00:48.120> bar<00:00:48.300> and

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
hats upside down on the bar and

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:49.819 
hats upside down on the bar and
listening<00:00:48.840> so<00:00:49.140> I<00:00:49.170> think<00:00:49.289> this<00:00:49.530> would<00:00:49.680> be

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:49.829 
listening so I think this would be

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.720 
listening so I think this would be
correct<00:00:50.129> just<00:00:50.820> like<00:00:51.030> that<00:00:51.300> okay<00:00:52.489> no<00:00:53.489> weight<00:00:53.699> on

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
correct just like that okay no weight on

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.450 
correct just like that okay no weight on
the<00:00:54.059> brim<00:00:54.329> basically<00:00:55.320> keeps<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:55.770> curve<00:00:56.100> in

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
the brim basically keeps the curve in

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.340 
the brim basically keeps the curve in
the<00:00:56.579> brim<00:00:56.820> there's<00:00:57.480> kind<00:00:57.780> of<00:00:57.870> like<00:00:58.050> a<00:00:58.079> little

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
the brim there's kind of like a little

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.590 
the brim there's kind of like a little
scoop<00:00:58.920> if<00:00:59.129> you<00:00:59.250> notice<00:00:59.520> that<00:00:59.640> curve<00:01:00.030> shape<00:01:00.449> to

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
scoop if you notice that curve shape to

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.479 
scoop if you notice that curve shape to
the<00:01:00.719> brim<00:01:00.960> and<00:01:01.559> what<00:01:01.680> that<00:01:01.829> does<00:01:02.129> is<00:01:02.370> it

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
the brim and what that does is it

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.600 
the brim and what that does is it
basically<00:01:02.670> allows<00:01:03.449> the<00:01:03.780> Hat<00:01:03.960> to<00:01:04.199> snap<00:01:04.619> up<00:01:05.040> and

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
basically allows the Hat to snap up and

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.330 
basically allows the Hat to snap up and
