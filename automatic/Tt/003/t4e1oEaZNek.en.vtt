hey<00:00:05.140> guys<00:00:05.350> welcome<00:00:05.680> back<00:00:05.920> to<00:00:06.610> my<00:00:07.240> gallery<00:00:07.600> here

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:08.340 
hey guys welcome back to my gallery here

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.839 
hey guys welcome back to my gallery here
got<00:00:09.340> a<00:00:09.599> vertical<00:00:11.309> double<00:00:12.309> piston<00:00:12.519> extender

00:00:12.839 --> 00:00:12.849 
got a vertical double piston extender

00:00:12.849 --> 00:00:16.950 
got a vertical double piston extender
and<00:00:13.510> retractor<00:00:14.429> contraption<00:00:15.720> it's<00:00:16.720> a

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:16.960 
and retractor contraption it's a

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.030 
and retractor contraption it's a
relatively<00:00:17.560> compact<00:00:18.400> of<00:00:18.700> lead<00:00:19.590> works<00:00:20.590> up<00:00:20.800> the

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:21.040 
relatively compact of lead works up the

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:23.790 
relatively compact of lead works up the
same<00:00:21.610> principle<00:00:22.239> as<00:00:22.419> the<00:00:22.619> horizontal<00:00:23.619> ones

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:23.800 
same principle as the horizontal ones

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.630 
same principle as the horizontal ones
I've<00:00:24.009> shown<00:00:25.000> you<00:00:25.029> recently<00:00:26.309> using<00:00:27.309> the

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:27.640 
I've shown you recently using the

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.019 
I've shown you recently using the
monostable<00:00:28.059> circuits<00:00:29.130> one<00:00:30.130> tick<00:00:30.340> pulses<00:00:30.820> it

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:31.029 
monostable circuits one tick pulses it

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:32.700 
monostable circuits one tick pulses it
will<00:00:31.149> shove<00:00:31.329> that<00:00:31.509> block<00:00:31.720> up<00:00:31.960> there<00:00:32.140> and<00:00:32.500> then

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:32.710 
will shove that block up there and then

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:35.369 
will shove that block up there and then
retract<00:00:33.130> itself<00:00:33.570> and<00:00:34.570> then<00:00:34.690> on<00:00:34.840> the<00:00:34.989> second

00:00:35.369 --> 00:00:35.379 
retract itself and then on the second

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:36.540 
retract itself and then on the second
let<00:00:35.500> the<00:00:35.530> push<00:00:35.800> it<00:00:36.010> will<00:00:36.129> bring<00:00:36.309> everything

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:36.550 
let the push it will bring everything

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:39.990 
let the push it will bring everything
back<00:00:36.670> down<00:00:37.469> so<00:00:38.469> i'll<00:00:38.800> show<00:00:39.100> you<00:00:39.219> how<00:00:39.370> to<00:00:39.429> build

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:40.000 
back down so i'll show you how to build

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:47.639 
back down so i'll show you how to build
this<00:00:40.829> start<00:00:41.829> with<00:00:43.109> two<00:00:44.999> stick<00:00:45.999> distance<00:00:46.649> and

00:00:47.639 --> 00:00:47.649 
this start with two stick distance and

00:00:47.649 --> 00:00:50.160 
this start with two stick distance and
then<00:00:47.800> a<00:00:47.859> block<00:00:48.309> on<00:00:48.519> top<00:00:48.579> that<00:00:49.239> is<00:00:49.870> going<00:00:50.050> to<00:00:50.109> be

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:50.170 
then a block on top that is going to be

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.229 
then a block on top that is going to be
the<00:00:50.350> retracted<00:00:51.219> block<00:00:51.659> then<00:00:52.659> i<00:00:52.690> got<00:00:52.960> two

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:54.239 
the retracted block then i got two

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.319 
the retracted block then i got two
pieces<00:00:55.239> of<00:00:55.269> dust<00:00:55.629> there<00:00:55.989> and<00:00:56.909> actually<00:00:57.909> we're

00:00:58.319 --> 00:00:58.329 
pieces of dust there and actually we're

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:01.950 
pieces of dust there and actually we're
here<00:00:58.920> don't<00:00:59.920> put<00:01:00.370> it<00:01:00.399> off<00:01:00.550> a<00:01:00.609> lot<00:01:00.969> easier<00:01:01.809> to

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:01.960 
here don't put it off a lot easier to

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:06.539 
here don't put it off a lot easier to
build<00:01:02.170> home<00:01:02.649> doing<00:01:02.920> this<00:01:05.009> so<00:01:06.009> the<00:01:06.189> repeaters

00:01:06.539 --> 00:01:06.549 
build home doing this so the repeaters

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:15.569 
build home doing this so the repeaters
on<00:01:06.729> three<00:01:08.399> the<00:01:13.320> so<00:01:14.320> this<00:01:14.500> is<00:01:14.530> the<00:01:14.890> monostable

00:01:15.569 --> 00:01:15.579 
on three the so this is the monostable

00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:19.800 
on three the so this is the monostable
circuit<00:01:16.270> right<00:01:16.540> here<00:01:18.090> Wanda<00:01:19.090> it'll<00:01:19.450> send<00:01:19.689> a

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:19.810 
circuit right here Wanda it'll send a

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.300 
circuit right here Wanda it'll send a
one<00:01:20.020> tick<00:01:20.290> pulse<00:01:20.619> over<00:01:21.130> to<00:01:21.579> this<00:01:22.299> block<00:01:23.310> this

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:24.310 
one tick pulse over to this block this

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:32.010 
one tick pulse over to this block this
point<00:01:25.079> and<00:01:27.119> and<00:01:28.119> then<00:01:29.039> we<00:01:30.039> need<00:01:30.189> to<00:01:30.990> you<00:01:31.990> just

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.020 
point and and then we need to you just

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.410 
point and and then we need to you just
have<00:01:32.380> this<00:01:32.680> it<00:01:33.219> will<00:01:33.490> extend<00:01:34.329> the<00:01:34.630> block<00:01:34.869> up

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
have this it will extend the block up

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.020 
have this it will extend the block up
forget<00:01:37.420> to<00:01:37.509> get<00:01:37.689> this<00:01:37.780> block<00:01:38.079> on<00:01:38.320> top<00:01:38.350> here

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
forget to get this block on top here

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.389 
forget to get this block on top here
send<00:01:40.030> that<00:01:40.180> power<00:01:40.450> up<00:01:40.860> but<00:01:41.860> if<00:01:41.979> you<00:01:42.070> just<00:01:42.219> have

00:01:42.389 --> 00:01:42.399 
send that power up but if you just have

00:01:42.399 --> 00:01:44.340 
send that power up but if you just have
this<00:01:42.430> one<00:01:42.789> fear<00:01:43.119> it'll<00:01:43.450> send<00:01:43.750> the<00:01:43.869> block<00:01:44.079> up

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:44.350 
this one fear it'll send the block up

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:46.620 
this one fear it'll send the block up
but<00:01:45.009> it<00:01:45.219> won't<00:01:45.430> retract<00:01:45.789> it<00:01:46.000> all<00:01:46.119> the<00:01:46.270> way<00:01:46.420> and

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:46.630 
but it won't retract it all the way and

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:48.660 
but it won't retract it all the way and
we'll<00:01:46.719> get<00:01:46.869> it<00:01:47.020> most<00:01:47.259> of<00:01:47.409> the<00:01:47.469> way<00:01:47.530> but<00:01:48.399> we<00:01:48.520> need

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:48.670 
we'll get it most of the way but we need

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:52.319 
we'll get it most of the way but we need
one<00:01:48.820> last<00:01:49.000> pulse<00:01:49.450> to<00:01:49.899> kick<00:01:50.710> this<00:01:50.920> piston<00:01:51.399> up

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:52.329 
one last pulse to kick this piston up

00:01:52.329 --> 00:02:00.620 
one last pulse to kick this piston up
and<00:01:52.750> we'll<00:01:52.899> do<00:01:53.079> that<00:01:54.119> right<00:01:55.119> here<00:01:57.960> with

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:00.630 
and we'll do that right here with

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:07.389 
and we'll do that right here with
a<00:02:00.689> couple<00:02:01.290> repeaters<00:02:01.860> set<00:02:02.100> on<00:02:02.250> fold<00:02:04.700> yeah<00:02:05.869> a

00:02:07.389 --> 00:02:07.399 
a couple repeaters set on fold yeah a

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:12.920 
a couple repeaters set on fold yeah a
piece<00:02:08.399> of<00:02:08.429> dust<00:02:08.610> right<00:02:09.209> there<00:02:11.660> black<00:02:12.660> is

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
piece of dust right there black is

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:19.490 
piece of dust right there black is
acting<00:02:13.440> up<00:02:13.590> /<00:02:15.200> stuck<00:02:18.110> see<00:02:19.110> if<00:02:19.200> I<00:02:19.319> did<00:02:19.470> that

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:19.500 
acting up / stuck see if I did that

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:28.580 
acting up / stuck see if I did that
right<00:02:25.730> so<00:02:26.730> there<00:02:26.880> you<00:02:26.970> go<00:02:27.140> vertical<00:02:28.140> double

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
right so there you go vertical double

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.350 
right so there you go vertical double
fist<00:02:28.830> extender<00:02:29.810> one<00:02:30.810> pulse<00:02:31.610> it<00:02:32.610> will<00:02:32.819> push<00:02:33.150> the

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:33.360 
fist extender one pulse it will push the

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.210 
fist extender one pulse it will push the
block<00:02:33.569> up<00:02:33.780> leave<00:02:34.110> it<00:02:34.260> up<00:02:34.349> there<00:02:34.380> when<00:02:34.860> we<00:02:35.010> track

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
block up leave it up there when we track

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.759 
block up leave it up there when we track
the<00:02:35.400> Pistons<00:02:35.790> the<00:02:36.180> next<00:02:36.510> button<00:02:37.049> push<00:02:37.260> it<00:02:37.620> will

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:37.769 
the Pistons the next button push it will

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:40.070 
the Pistons the next button push it will
forget<00:02:38.340> backbone<00:02:38.790> retract<00:02:39.480> everything<00:02:39.630> under

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:40.080 
forget backbone retract everything under

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.860 
forget backbone retract everything under
the<00:02:40.170> floor<00:02:40.760> you<00:02:41.760> can<00:02:41.970> completely<00:02:42.420> hide<00:02:42.660> this

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
the floor you can completely hide this

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:55.699 
the floor you can completely hide this
under<00:02:43.470> the<00:02:43.739> floor<00:02:44.239> nothing<00:02:45.239> sticks<00:02:45.569> up<00:02:54.709> like

00:02:55.699 --> 00:02:55.709 
under the floor nothing sticks up like

00:02:55.709 --> 00:03:11.110 
under the floor nothing sticks up like
so<00:02:56.069> just<00:03:03.500> didn't<00:03:04.500> quite<00:03:04.650> get<00:03:04.799> at<00:03:04.890> that<00:03:05.040> time

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:11.120 

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:15.460 

there<00:03:12.120> we<00:03:12.180> go<00:03:12.680> sometimes<00:03:13.680> the<00:03:13.829> buttons<00:03:14.190> don't

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:15.470 
there we go sometimes the buttons don't

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:17.770 
there we go sometimes the buttons don't
activate<00:03:16.470> for<00:03:16.709> the<00:03:16.799> proper<00:03:17.130> length<00:03:17.310> of<00:03:17.519> time

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
activate for the proper length of time

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:23.180 
activate for the proper length of time
it's<00:03:18.780> been<00:03:19.019> a<00:03:19.049> bud<00:03:19.290> for<00:03:19.530> a<00:03:19.560> while

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:23.190 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:26.460 

the<00:03:24.190> work<00:03:24.310> was<00:03:24.460> fun<00:03:25.140> alright<00:03:26.140> thanks<00:03:26.440> for
