00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.150
 back against the wall 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:13.029
 sued me 

00:00:13.029 --> 00:00:15.879
 shortage of 25 new rules 

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:17.460
 nuclear power plants 

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:19.390
 the half-cooked duck 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:21.339
 slices of bread of spicy 

00:00:21.339 --> 00:00:22.519
 of autumn 

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:24.249
 it's a berlin drama 

00:00:24.249 --> 00:00:26.829
 despite the risks of a currency war 

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:28.419
 third album 

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:33.300
 george leekens cycle 3 dan livelihoods for thousands of years and the 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.970
 pepper 

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:36.580
 we will realize 

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:39.880
 unesco repeatedly resumed this crisis point sector 

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:41.650
 ready because 

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:44.650
 for this béchard he'll have to 

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.500
 what benefits 

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.830
 this documentary of anne sinclair as the joysticks at the end in decoration 

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:53.440
 so we learned that we leave so quiet 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.240
 like that some kind and then we pass it on the chopper and this year a 

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:01.000
 breadcrumbs all parts 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
 Then we will cut competitive 

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:06.619
 dried fruit so here I chose 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:07.950
 dates 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.680
 I chose aprico 

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.430
 and I chose some elements 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:12.480
 it is sufficient that 

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.760
 we will cut them into small pieces 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.760
 or in small dice or small pieces as you want 

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.140
 now we will take care of the posts 

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:27.230
 so if the apple is peeled 

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:31.500
 cut into slices then cut into small cubes and now the action flower beds 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.500
 the pan for the outbreak he adored 

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:36.360
 you're not fed up 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.370
 we were outside and inside it's a little bit scared 

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:42.540
 the 1400 a saucepan she is boiling 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.420
 and I'm going to make it blaze but the counterattack 

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.980
 that's it flames alas you bathed all these teams fire that 

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:51.870
 is below 

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:54.760
 thaçi it will prevent the flame from rising 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:56.840
 it stabilizes 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.840
 and alcohol is the door 

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:04.930
 in the crowd 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.239
 so here are our doors are golden and well founded now we have 

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:16.659
 get rid of them in a container and cool high schools 

00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:21.010
 now we're going to director for me though not and for that he 

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.459
 you must be kind, you must have mitzui duck or goose as we know 

00:02:26.139 --> 00:02:28.219
 while we are going to cut 

00:02:28.219 --> 00:02:29.799
 per slice 

00:02:29.799 --> 00:02:32.809
 no matter how anyway the mixed pallet 

00:02:33.639 --> 00:02:35.419
 traps in progress but 

00:02:35.419 --> 00:02:37.339
 but a piece of foie gras 

00:02:37.339 --> 00:02:39.579
 it's right there it's not very complicated 

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:42.579
 and then sell a taylor clark product 

00:02:43.459 --> 00:02:45.019
 some 20 meters 

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:48.019
 Above 

00:02:49.589 --> 00:02:51.869
 you will not tell me it's difficult 

00:02:51.869 --> 00:02:55.309
 they had us but it's the turn 

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:58.309
 at 5 am faith crass crowd of the primaries 

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:08.159
 now in this perspective now 

00:03:10.259 --> 00:03:12.509
 the cream of foie gras in the whistler 

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:16.789
 and for that I use a glimpse of a strainer so that the cream is 

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:19.789
 extremely list is not at all small pieces 

00:03:24.909 --> 00:03:27.139
 and the fact of equatorial guinea 

00:03:27.139 --> 00:03:31.359
 the time hope the foie gras the time when much lighter than a very thin 

00:03:35.949 --> 00:03:37.309
 yet that now 

00:03:37.309 --> 00:03:40.309
 we are going to divide the dried fruits in each verrine 

00:03:41.499 --> 00:03:44.129
 a little bit 

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:47.129
 any word 

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:51.739
 you know what sometimes I also add a little bit of pot-au-noir 

00:03:52.619 --> 00:03:56.279
 because black pudding apple and foie gras these delicious the morning site 

00:03:57.529 --> 00:04:00.529
 master our fight on the other hand from 

00:04:01.579 --> 00:04:04.579
 Warning 

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:11.529
 it's not magic 

00:04:11.529 --> 00:04:14.529
 and save lives 

00:04:18.999 --> 00:04:21.999
 now only a little bit of gingerbread crumbs over it 

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:30.090
 and that's it, you're done 

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:33.090
 and party allo 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:38.479
 dollars
