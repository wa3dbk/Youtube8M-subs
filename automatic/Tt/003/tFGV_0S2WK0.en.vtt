00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:09.799
 much desire for all one boys 

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:10.969
 judo welcome my first 

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:12.410
 video on juan 

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:13.820
 for the occasion the cd to bring you 

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:15.799
 something different than we will play a 

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:17.690
 then horror talks newstreet talks 

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:19.910
 mica that I was pretty on if not 

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:22.460
 he knows about the blues rift is a viewer for 

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:24.650
 the virtual reality that will allow us in 

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.250
 few words to enter into the 

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:26.660
 video game 

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:29.000
 I would say the best way I have for 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:32.119
 to let you see it is to enter precisely into 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.280
 videogame 15 we see in dragons 

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:36.290
 and here we are in dragons, ladies and gentlemen 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:38.090
 as I told you to enter into the 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:40.190
 game based on where i look in mine 

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:42.890
 room moves the possible view 

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.570
 play with gestures between 60 as well as it 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:46.220
 they do try even when you try 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.770
 directly the plus the first time 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:50.239
 because it is very simple substantially 

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:52.700
 we are in a dungeon we have ours 

00:00:50.239 --> 00:00:54.860
 map yet to be discovered and must find 

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:57.559
 the release is a horror game because it is 

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:59.690
 full of madonna the interior is full of 

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:01.160
 monsters and various stuff 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.500
 even though I played this game 

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:05.600
 billions of times the environment 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.149
 the experience with the crus rift the audio 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.780
 everything makes me get goose bumps up 

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:12.259
 to the ceiling 

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:14.630
 let's get started right away 

00:01:12.259 --> 00:01:16.249
 arrangement as I said a map a 

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.020
 inventory in which we have one 

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:21.229
 bottle of oil in this case of 

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:22.340
 coins that do not yet have a utility 

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:23.869
 within the game 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.569
 I don't know if I told you the monsters are 

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:30.889
 a species of giant lizard a 

00:01:26.569 --> 00:01:33.799
 gargoyle and a little girl that I hate 

00:01:30.889 --> 00:01:36.020
 I hate too much to die of course being 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:38.529
 a dungeon we can collect things there 

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:40.880
 will be cases to open doors from 

00:01:38.529 --> 00:01:44.919
 open wide and angles to turn that me 

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:47.779
 they'll literally shit in your hand 

00:01:44.919 --> 00:01:48.560
 we hope to find the first release 

00:01:47.779 --> 00:01:51.799
 possible 

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:54.229
 wow the environment is absurd if you have niche 

00:01:51.799 --> 00:01:55.299
 swift absolutely try this game 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:58.939
 it's free 

00:01:55.299 --> 00:02:00.800
 you just need to finish the oil we lie 

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:03.090
 a little light 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:06.300
 obviously it's free you can find it 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.130
 on the forum of the cruz rift and there is the 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.619
 baby is that door I hope you have 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:19.110
 sight because I will not go back in 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:22.770
 that damned oil door 

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:25.500
 perfect let 's take the thing was the 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:27.540
 lizard lizards lords and their 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:31.980
 I didn't remember a lizard 

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:33.660
 so giant is an alien 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:40.380
 ok we explored the whole part 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:44.010
 left gone from here we snap 

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:47.880
 we also cover the capacity of 

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:49.500
 speak when playing this game 

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.810
 let's find the exit here closed 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:55.860
 from a nation where they have gone back 

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:57.900
 then the almost already gone then 

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:00.390
 we simply pass this way 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:03.870
 here we turn a door to the right 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:06.440
 perfect process that will make you sweat ve 

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:09.180
 I assure you also in the most way 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:11.940
 damn quiet they almost did 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:15.720
 torture when it looks like other oil 

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:17.370
 let's use it because the two bottles 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:20.160
 ok you have practically seen all the 

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:23.700
 that is, show the alien la madonna e 

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:27.900
 the child as a child you see her if 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:31.620
 she feels something turns and if she catches you 

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:34.200
 it will be better to run because it will follow us 

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:37.500
 until death we can still see oil 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:42.330
 perfect entrance a box we go on 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:45.720
 left right here ok go grave di 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:48.300
 a light let's see if the exit though 

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:50.700
 it does not seem to me that Russia is rather red 

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:53.459
 so let's say it's one of those rooms 

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:55.700
 that maybe contains something I heard 

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:59.610
 some steps behind and I literally are 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:01.400
 crap in your hand ok is nothing is not not 

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:05.170
 there is absolutely nothing and a troll 

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:08.980
 scary that room 

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:14.890
 if I remember correctly the exit of a 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:16.900
 quietly scale with a light ok ok 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:19.079
 you saw I had nothing to do with it c 

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:19.079
 within 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:24.630
 I literally shit myself 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:30.610
 empty room the big trolls 

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:32.290
 scary 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:34.780
 obviously you saw the girl 

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:37.600
 fixed that looked at nothing I try to 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:42.820
 open them run away but it moves moves yes 

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:44.320
 that alien also moves the exit la 

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:46.690
 child 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:48.250
 the child at the exit you see you have it 

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:50.139
 sight sir 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:54.340
 there is a problem the child at the exit 

00:04:50.139 --> 00:04:57.910
 so we should enter and run away 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:59.860
 we do it gentlemen because here it could 

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:09.700
 return the alien but I don't think there is 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:11.890
 steps she left 60 fatah developed 

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:15.070
 from sergio and dulko sergi varigotti 

00:05:11.890 --> 00:05:17.470
 they are infarcted because they shit on themselves 

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:19.630
 wow absurd I am sweating now I take off 

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:22.960
 all the equipment and we talk about it 

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:25.320
 here I am gentlemen I have risen or the 

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:27.460
 super spotted heisenberg mesh 

00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:28.810
 an absurd experience always one 

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:32.140
 fantastic experience even though I already have it 

00:05:28.810 --> 00:05:33.430
 played billions of times it looks like one 

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:35.800
 bullshit but it really seems to be 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:38.650
 within the game the environment sounds 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:40.090
 anything seems super real 

00:05:38.650 --> 00:05:41.919
 yet the one I have is the version 

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:44.820
 cruz number one as you can see 

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:49.270
 supports a maximum resolution of 1280 

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:50.919
 x 800 while from a year there is in 

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:51.520
 I trade version 2 that comes up 

00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:54.220
 at full hd 

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:54.820
 I dare not imagine the graphics and things 

00:05:54.220 --> 00:05:57.190
 exaggerated 

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:58.810
 I haven't tried it in shortly yet 

00:05:57.190 --> 00:06:00.820
 theory at the end of 2015 the version will be released 

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:03.039
 complete in all stores because this 

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:05.590
 which I have is version 2 are 

00:06:03.039 --> 00:06:08.050
 available only on credit I can't 

00:06:05.590 --> 00:06:10.539
 even to talk I hope there is video 

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:12.340
 liked excuse me thank you also unia 

00:06:10.539 --> 00:06:15.690
