00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:04.290 
today I'm going to show you a reaper

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.140 
today I'm going to show you a reaper
tutorial<00:00:04.770> I'm<00:00:05.370> gonna<00:00:05.580> show<00:00:05.790> you<00:00:05.850> the<00:00:06.000> basics

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:06.150 
tutorial I'm gonna show you the basics

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.750 
tutorial I'm gonna show you the basics
of<00:00:06.509> rewiring<00:00:06.899> reason<00:00:07.440> into<00:00:07.649> Reaper<00:00:07.950> you'll

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
of rewiring reason into Reaper you'll

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.339 
of rewiring reason into Reaper you'll
need<00:00:08.880> to<00:00:09.000> have<00:00:09.120> both<00:00:09.360> reason<00:00:09.780> and<00:00:09.960> Reaper

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:10.349 
need to have both reason and Reaper

00:00:10.349 --> 00:00:11.720 
need to have both reason and Reaper
installed<00:00:10.769> and<00:00:11.010> you'll<00:00:11.370> need<00:00:11.460> to<00:00:11.580> have<00:00:11.700> a

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:11.730 
installed and you'll need to have a

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.520 
installed and you'll need to have a
basic<00:00:12.120> understanding<00:00:12.210> of<00:00:12.809> the<00:00:12.900> interfaces<00:00:13.500> of

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
basic understanding of the interfaces of

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.750 
basic understanding of the interfaces of
both<00:00:13.740> programs<00:00:16.039> let's<00:00:17.039> start<00:00:17.279> by<00:00:17.369> opening<00:00:17.400> up

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:17.760 
both programs let's start by opening up

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.439 
both programs let's start by opening up
Reaper<00:00:18.090> first<00:00:19.490> then<00:00:20.490> we'll<00:00:20.670> add<00:00:20.820> a<00:00:20.850> track<00:00:21.210> and

00:00:21.439 --> 00:00:21.449 
Reaper first then we'll add a track and

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:25.550 
Reaper first then we'll add a track and
open<00:00:21.869> the<00:00:21.960> effects<00:00:22.289> panel<00:00:24.170> then<00:00:25.170> we<00:00:25.289> want<00:00:25.470> to

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
open the effects panel then we want to

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.349 
open the effects panel then we want to
add<00:00:25.650> the<00:00:25.800> rewire<00:00:26.220> Reason<00:00:26.730> plug-in<00:00:27.090> from<00:00:27.269> the

00:00:27.349 --> 00:00:27.359 
add the rewire Reason plug-in from the

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.419 
add the rewire Reason plug-in from the
list<00:00:27.539> this<00:00:28.289> should<00:00:28.470> open<00:00:28.560> reason<00:00:29.010> up<00:00:29.130> for<00:00:29.340> you

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:29.429 
list this should open reason up for you

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:32.260 
list this should open reason up for you
automatically

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:32.270 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:34.729 

assure<00:00:33.270> that<00:00:33.300> reason<00:00:33.750> is<00:00:33.870> running<00:00:34.170> in<00:00:34.290> rewire

00:00:34.729 --> 00:00:34.739 
assure that reason is running in rewire

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:42.770 
assure that reason is running in rewire
slave<00:00:35.190> mode<00:00:35.460> this<00:00:36.239> is<00:00:36.390> key<00:00:41.480> that<00:00:42.480> was<00:00:42.600> pretty

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:42.780 
slave mode this is key that was pretty

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.510 
slave mode this is key that was pretty
much<00:00:42.930> done<00:00:43.170> you<00:00:43.680> can<00:00:43.829> build<00:00:43.980> your<00:00:44.100> reason<00:00:44.399> rack

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
much done you can build your reason rack

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.069 
much done you can build your reason rack
as<00:00:44.670> you<00:00:44.789> normally<00:00:44.910> would<00:00:45.180> and<00:00:45.420> use<00:00:45.660> reason<00:00:45.989> to

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
as you normally would and use reason to

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:49.970 
as you normally would and use reason to
mix<00:00:47.329> all<00:00:48.329> Odin<00:00:48.690> nnxt<00:00:49.079> now<00:00:49.350> to<00:00:49.590> show<00:00:49.739> you<00:00:49.829> what<00:00:49.950> I

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:49.980 
mix all Odin nnxt now to show you what I

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.600 
mix all Odin nnxt now to show you what I
mean

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 

00:00:53.610 --> 00:01:02.220 

notice<00:00:54.610> that<00:00:54.700> when<00:00:54.820> I<00:00:54.850> press<00:00:54.910> my<00:00:55.210> keyboard<00:01:01.230> our

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:02.230 
notice that when I press my keyboard our

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:04.619 
notice that when I press my keyboard our
signal<00:01:02.620> goes<00:01:02.770> directly<00:01:03.130> to<00:01:03.280> Reaper<00:01:03.570> now<00:01:04.570> we

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:04.629 
signal goes directly to Reaper now we

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:06.000 
signal goes directly to Reaper now we
can<00:01:04.839> use<00:01:04.989> reason<00:01:05.320> to<00:01:05.410> mix<00:01:05.590> as<00:01:05.740> we<00:01:05.860> normally

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:06.010 
can use reason to mix as we normally

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:06.510 
can use reason to mix as we normally
would

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:06.520 
would

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:29.180 
would
including<00:01:07.060> panning

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:29.190 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:37.670 

and<00:01:29.390> volume

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:54.940 

you

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:54.950 

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:57.230 

you<00:01:55.950> can<00:01:56.100> also<00:01:56.220> apply<00:01:56.400> any<00:01:56.729> of<00:01:56.820> reasons

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:57.240 
you can also apply any of reasons

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.890 
you can also apply any of reasons
built-in<00:01:57.600> effects<00:01:59.300> the<00:02:00.300> reason<00:02:00.600> this<00:02:00.690> works

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:00.900 
built-in effects the reason this works

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:02.060 
built-in effects the reason this works
is<00:02:01.050> because<00:02:01.110> you're<00:02:01.350> plugged<00:02:01.560> into<00:02:01.680> one<00:02:01.920> and

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
is because you're plugged into one and

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:12.059 
is because you're plugged into one and
two<00:02:02.190> of<00:02:02.310> your<00:02:02.400> audio<00:02:02.700> i/o

00:02:12.059 --> 00:02:12.069 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:21.680 

you

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:21.690 

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.150 

and<00:02:22.690> that's<00:02:22.930> it<00:02:23.110> if<00:02:23.620> you'd<00:02:23.830> like<00:02:23.920> to<00:02:24.070> know

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
and that's it if you'd like to know

and that's it if you'd like to know
