situational<00:04:43.930> I<00:04:44.110> think<00:04:44.470> in<00:04:44.650> the<00:04:44.800> long<00:04:45.010> run<00:04:45.420> you

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:46.420 
situational I think in the long run you

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:50.760 
situational I think in the long run you
know<00:04:46.620> where<00:04:48.240> after<00:04:49.240> that<00:04:49.420> we've<00:04:49.600> got<00:04:49.870> a<00:04:50.140> mirror

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:50.770 
know where after that we've got a mirror

know where after that we've got a mirror
force<00:04:51.130> I<00:04:51.460> will<00:04:52.240> probably<00:04:52.900> try<00:04:53.320> to<00:04:53.350> replace

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:53.710 
force I will probably try to replace

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:55.200 
force I will probably try to replace
this<00:04:53.890> with<00:04:54.100> torrential<00:04:54.430> tribute<00:04:54.730> just

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:55.210 
this with torrential tribute just

00:04:55.210 --> 00:04:58.170 
this with torrential tribute just
because<00:04:55.360> I<00:04:55.480> find<00:04:55.780> it's<00:04:55.990> way<00:04:56.260> better<00:04:56.920> and<00:04:57.250> then

00:04:58.170 --> 00:04:58.180 
because I find it's way better and then

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:03.870 
because I find it's way better and then
we've<00:04:58.390> got<00:04:58.420> the<00:04:59.320> solid<00:05:00.190> brigade<00:05:00.580> and<00:05:02.880> two

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:03.880 
we've got the solid brigade and two

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:07.110 
we've got the solid brigade and two
fiendish<00:05:04.330> chains<00:05:04.690> I<00:05:05.110> you<00:05:05.980> could<00:05:06.190> possibly<00:05:06.790> run

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:07.120 
fiendish chains I you could possibly run

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:09.210 
fiendish chains I you could possibly run
