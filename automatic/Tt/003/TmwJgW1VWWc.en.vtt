the bottom and I'll show you where it is

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:56.850 
the bottom and I'll show you where it is
on<00:00:49.530> the<00:00:49.620> motherboard

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:56.860 

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:59.230 

I've<00:00:57.860> already<00:00:57.980> got<00:00:58.220> it<00:00:58.310> set<00:00:58.550> up<00:00:58.730> under<00:00:59.150> the

00:00:59.230 --> 00:00:59.240 
I've already got it set up under the

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:05.980 
I've already got it set up under the
microscopes<00:00:59.870> we<00:01:00.080> might<00:01:00.230> be<00:01:00.410> a<00:01:00.440> little<00:01:04.900> see<00:01:05.900> the

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:05.990 
microscopes we might be a little see the

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:08.110 
microscopes we might be a little see the
black<00:01:06.200> chip<00:01:06.530> right<00:01:06.740> here<00:01:06.800> that's<00:01:07.760> the<00:01:07.880> chip

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:08.120 
black chip right here that's the chip

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:10.210 
black chip right here that's the chip
that<00:01:08.150> needs<00:01:08.420> to<00:01:08.510> be<00:01:08.600> replaced<00:01:08.920> so<00:01:09.920> that's<00:01:10.070> what

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:10.220 
that needs to be replaced so that's what

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.210 
that needs to be replaced so that's what
we're<00:01:10.310> gonna<00:01:10.400> be<00:01:10.580> doing<00:01:10.820> today<00:01:12.070> let's<00:01:13.070> get

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:13.220 
we're gonna be doing today let's get

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:41.920 
we're gonna be doing today let's get
right<00:01:13.310> to<00:01:13.460> it

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:41.930 

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:44.390 

okay<00:01:42.930> so<00:01:42.990> we<00:01:43.140> got<00:01:43.260> the<00:01:43.380> chip<00:01:43.590> off<00:01:43.770> we<00:01:44.160> have<00:01:44.310> to

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:44.400 
okay so we got the chip off we have to

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:45.800 
okay so we got the chip off we have to
make<00:01:44.550> a<00:01:44.580> couple<00:01:44.820> different<00:01:45.210> videos<00:01:45.510> and

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
make a couple different videos and

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:48.260 
make a couple different videos and
limited<00:01:46.470> to<00:01:46.560> five<00:01:46.770> minutes<00:01:46.910> recording<00:01:47.910> on<00:01:48.240> my

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
limited to five minutes recording on my

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:51.800 
limited to five minutes recording on my
phone<00:01:49.370> so<00:01:50.370> zoom<00:01:50.730> through<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.120> camera<00:01:51.510> the

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:51.810 
phone so zoom through the camera the

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.440 
phone so zoom through the camera the
lens<00:01:51.990> here<00:01:52.580> see<00:01:53.580> if<00:01:53.640> you<00:01:53.670> can<00:01:53.820> get<00:01:53.970> a<00:01:54.000> shot<00:01:54.060> of

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:54.450 
lens here see if you can get a shot of

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:18.320 
lens here see if you can get a shot of
it

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:19.940 

so<00:02:18.900> there<00:02:19.050> you<00:02:19.110> can<00:02:19.140> see<00:02:19.290> all<00:02:19.470> the<00:02:19.680> solder

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
so there you can see all the solder

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:23.060 
so there you can see all the solder
balls<00:02:20.840> from<00:02:21.840> the<00:02:22.020> chip<00:02:22.200> that<00:02:22.350> we<00:02:22.440> removed<00:02:22.950> so

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:23.070 
balls from the chip that we removed so

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:28.010 
balls from the chip that we removed so
now<00:02:23.190> we're<00:02:23.280> going<00:02:23.370> to<00:02:23.460> clean<00:02:23.730> that<00:02:23.760> up<00:02:25.730> and<00:02:27.020> put

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
now we're going to clean that up and put

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:29.900 
now we're going to clean that up and put
the<00:02:28.110> new<00:02:28.200> chip<00:02:28.410> on<00:02:28.590> then<00:02:29.370> we'll<00:02:29.460> be<00:02:29.580> ready<00:02:29.760> to

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
the new chip on then we'll be ready to

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:35.650 
the new chip on then we'll be ready to
go

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:35.660 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:37.660

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:37.670 
all right so I'm back and I've got the

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:41.020 
all right so I'm back and I've got the
pads<00:02:37.880> all<00:02:38.090> cleaned<00:02:38.420> up<00:02:39.430> so<00:02:40.430> I'm<00:02:40.550> just<00:02:40.730> trying

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:41.030 
pads all cleaned up so I'm just trying

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:58.860 
pads all cleaned up so I'm just trying
to<00:02:41.120> zoom<00:02:41.300> in<00:02:41.510> here<00:02:41.540> so<00:02:41.870> you<00:02:41.930> can<00:02:41.990> see

it might be hard to tell but you see all
the<00:03:03.220> pads<00:03:03.730> from<00:03:04.000> the<00:03:04.120> chip<00:03:04.860> cleaned<00:03:05.860> all<00:03:06.040> those

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
the pads from the chip cleaned all those

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.030 
the pads from the chip cleaned all those
up<00:03:06.519> so<00:03:06.959> now<00:03:07.959> we're<00:03:08.080> ready<00:03:08.230> to<00:03:08.349> apply<00:03:08.650> some<00:03:08.890> flux

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:09.040 
up so now we're ready to apply some flux

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:11.119 
up so now we're ready to apply some flux
in<00:03:09.370> the<00:03:09.430> new<00:03:09.549> chip<00:03:09.790> and<00:03:10.030> we'll<00:03:10.599> be<00:03:10.720> on<00:03:10.750> our<00:03:10.870> way

00:03:11.119 --> 00:03:11.129 
in the new chip and we'll be on our way

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:14.039 
in the new chip and we'll be on our way
so<00:03:12.129> get<00:03:12.280> this<00:03:12.400> all<00:03:12.580> set<00:03:12.819> up<00:03:12.849> and<00:03:13.629> we'll<00:03:13.930> get

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:14.049 
so get this all set up and we'll get

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:20.910 
so get this all set up and we'll get
recording<00:03:19.110> you've<00:03:20.110> got<00:03:20.200> everything<00:03:20.440> set<00:03:20.769> up

00:04:16.019 --> 00:04:28.780 
I'm sorry all my flux now I'm gonna add
the<00:04:16.170> chip<00:04:16.440> back

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:28.790 

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:36.930 

I'm<00:04:29.790> sure<00:04:30.090> it<00:04:30.180> gets<00:04:30.300> aligned<00:04:30.630> properly

alright so I've got everything lined up
I've<00:04:45.759> got<00:04:45.940> the<00:04:45.970> new<00:04:46.150> chip<00:04:46.360> in<00:04:46.479> place<00:04:46.680> and<00:04:47.680> ready

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:47.860 
I've got the new chip in place and ready

00:04:47.860 --> 00:05:46.659 
I've got the new chip in place and ready
to<00:04:47.979> fire<00:04:48.250> this<00:04:48.490> up<00:04:49.919> there<00:04:50.919> we<00:04:51.039> go
