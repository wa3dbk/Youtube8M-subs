00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:04.549
 [Music] 

00:00:02.199 --> 00:00:07.700
 hi before friends today I you 

00:00:04.549 --> 00:00:10.610
 presents the recipe of the bringers there you 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:14.300
 will need a little bit of salt a worm of 

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:16.160
 flour 1 glass of mashed flakes a 

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:17.929
 glass of hot water and a small 

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.089
 teaspoon of baking powder 

00:00:17.929 --> 00:00:22.609
 the first step is simple 

00:00:20.089 --> 00:00:23.710
 go pour a pinch of salt into the 

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:26.419
 glass of hot water 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:27.919
 then in a salad bowl you go 

00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:31.460
 put all the ingredients dry so 

00:00:27.919 --> 00:00:34.550
 you're going to put the flour the flakes 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.969
 of potatoes is over with the 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:40.899
 yeast 

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:44.000
 we mix and finish by adding the 

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:46.969
 so here we will work well the dough 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.160
 with the wines and this dough 

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:51.140
 we will now state them or do it 

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:53.629
 pass in a special machine for the 

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.399
 round as fine as possible 

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:57.140
 the device that I'm going to use so 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:59.480
 how does it work and a crank is 

00:00:57.140 --> 00:01:02.059
 very simple and we pass the paw of 

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.839
 teeth until you get a most 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:04.400
 fine possible 

00:01:02.839 --> 00:01:06.110
 so that's what I'm going to do and then 

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.270
 I want to show you directly the 

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.920
 final result that's the dough you 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.229
 get you see it's very late on 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.970
 already sees a little bit the texture of the 

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:16.720
 chips and there using a cookie cutter 

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:19.549
 we just cut our chips 

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:21.649
 so that's the result we have some 

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:24.439
 chips and here we will come to fry them 

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:28.460
 in oil in hot oil 

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:30.469
 will come and cook our chips so the 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:34.399
 cooking time goes very very fast 

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:37.460
 not even fifteen seconds of 

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:39.950
 think of returning it and then to the 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:41.750
 get out of the oil after having them 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:44.030
 Drain on paper towels 

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:47.180
 we just let go and there you can 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:49.039
 also add some paprika or a little 

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.329
 BBQ spices if you want 

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:51.890
 give flavor to your chips 

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:54.530
 so here I show you we have some 

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:56.000
 nice well rounded chips and then a 

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.710
 level of taste we'll see what's going 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.250
 give right away by going to the 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.140
 tasting 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.290
 then we go we will immediately 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.910
 passed to taste 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.040
 so we have numbers that are good 

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:05.880
 regular we see a little salt at 

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:11.190
 above it makes you want 

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:13.230
 so that's really frankly friends 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:16.770
 it's big fat big fat 

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.930
 big killing we have a chips that is 

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.760
 very crispy with the taste that 

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:23.130
 looks but downright hawking is a 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.880
 whew thing because actually for everything 

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.710
 tell you I had seen him a little 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:27.810
 documentary on the price recipe 

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:30.090
 nuances and it's pretty much the same as 

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:32.280
 I was able to propose to you it is the same who 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.620
 do pretty much machined so that's it 

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.420
 feel free to leave the small test 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:38.370
 advice that is very important it is 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.840
 really make the finest dough 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.670
 possible sometimes it's a little bit hard 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:43.830
 it tends to break but really 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:45.560
 try again 2.3 times you will see you 

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:48.630
 go get a crispy chips 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:51.209
