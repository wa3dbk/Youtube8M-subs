00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:14.170
 Hi, I'm Eugenie. 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:16.290
 Today I'm baking cheese. 

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:19.580
 You can make pan with SpringForm, 

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:22.120
 Or a cupcake. 

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:23.420
 This is my choice 

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:26.210
 It is the fastest way. 

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:31.420
 I want my cheese today, not tomorrow. 

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:33.070
 For this recipe, you will need to: 

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.670
 3 ounces digestive biscuits, crushed into fine crumbs (85g) 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.380
 2 tablespoons melted butter (30g) 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:43.290
 Cream Cheese 9 oz, softened (255g) 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.910
 2/3 cup sugar granules (133g) 

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:48.120
 ملعقة teaspoon cornstarch 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.120
 ملعقة teaspoon pure vanilla extract 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.710
 1 tablespoon fresh lemon juice 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:58.210
 And 2 eggs 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:03.410
 First, in a bowl, add biscuit crumbs and melted butter. 

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:08.050
 And even stirred together. 

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:13.870
 Then split the mixture between cupcake molds lined with cupcake linings. 

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:16.880
 Today you silicone molds. 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:22.880
 Press down firmly to make the crust. 

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.170
 In another mixing bowl, 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:27.370
 Add in cream cheese softened 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:31.880
 And with a spoon spread the cheese vigorously press into the bowl. 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.290
 In this way there will be blocks. 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:40.290
 To soften the cream cheese I microwave oven for 15 seconds. 

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:47.080
 And even hit just smooth. 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.830
 Add sugar, 

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:54.120
 Corn Starch, 

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.000
 Vanilla extract, 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.540
 And lemon juice. 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.550
 With lemon juice the cheese tastes better. 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:05.970
 It turns slightly 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:11.970
 And beaten until creamy. 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:27.580
 Beat in one of the eggs at a time until it becomes soft. 

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.920
 Divide the mixture between the molds. 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.710
 Just fill 2/3 of the mold. 

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:54.200
 It is very liquidy. 

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:59.830
 Press the pan on the working surface to make it higher. 

00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:05.830
 Bake in a 355 ° F warmed oven for 180 ° C for 20 minutes 

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.870
 Or even rose. 

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:15.080
 From the oven, transfer to a wire rack 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:19.170
 Allow to cool completely in the pan. 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:25.170
 And be prepared for at least 2 hours prior to presentation. 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.000
 Voila, 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.790
 On top of it soaked a bit, this is normal. 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:37.790
 I will serve my mini cheese with cream and fruit jam. 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:42.210
 Quick and easy baked cheese. 

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:48.210
 I love my thin little cheesecakes. 

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:54.500
 Bon appetite. 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:13.630
 Today he baked him cheese and tomorrow she Alfredo pasta. 

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:17.910

00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:23.750

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:29.750
 Goodbye for now.
