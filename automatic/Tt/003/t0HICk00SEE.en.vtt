 based on the malfunction you would say that all that undefeated series without 

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:12.600
 craziness bond 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.440
 especially considering the recent one 

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:15.590
 ado worries 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.860
 the last five duels in Amsterdam rarely for a stunt 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:20.450

 in all those years the three times is the same for the last time in 2013 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:29.870
 the points in-house at ajax in the past two seasons 

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.610
 the feasibility 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:35.330
 these are competitions in Amsterdam 

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:39.100
 ado only got three seats out of the shop 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.230
 this de mosquito showed ajax and lady 82 thousands of libians were no mess at all 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:45.520
 resigned from the hague 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:46.970
 in defense 

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:49.970
 to wait 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.280
 that's 7 8 players 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.340
 for ajax in half 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.340
 away 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.970
 slots 

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:11.379
 the 32nd and last makeover 

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:14.379
 booked last season 

00:02:15.979 --> 00:02:20.769
 it was no poles no less than 5 he sues we ajax benefited in 2015 

00:02:20.769 --> 00:02:23.589
 last week was known he found not posted 

00:02:23.589 --> 00:02:26.669
 by beating his own goalkeeper 

00:02:26.669 --> 00:02:29.749
 the meeting without any sign that the oldest team from the Premier League is visiting 

00:02:29.749 --> 00:02:32.079
 joins the youngest team of the 

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:35.019
 instead of ajax was to sit in the first round of play 

00:02:35.019 --> 00:02:37.829
 that on 22 years 230 days 

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:42.119
 team building this against fc twente plays drivers more than 6 years old 

00:02:42.119 --> 00:02:45.119
 de bilt 27 years skating the world cup 

00:02:46.609 --> 00:02:49.479
 and that is also the competition between the two leading teams of the 

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:50.219

 ajax is then seven goals of the operation 

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:57.109
 but I am not the third but accurate 

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:01.889
 Leader Inter is after the or they could head 

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:03.859
 on three times the net 

00:03:03.859 --> 00:03:06.300
 So watch out for the leader of the hagenaars 

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.349
 but also a weapon for time 

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:11.719
 the high above 

00:03:11.719 --> 00:03:12.869
 the referee 

00:03:12.869 --> 00:03:14.299

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:17.349
 after the first tournament to which top 10 

00:03:17.349 --> 00:03:18.669
