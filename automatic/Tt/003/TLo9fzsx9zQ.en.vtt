got a men's and women's program and the
way<00:00:17.310> we<00:00:17.460> did<00:00:17.640> this<00:00:17.760> is<00:00:17.820> we<00:00:17.970> actually<00:00:18.330> have<00:00:18.420> a

00:00:18.439 --> 00:00:18.449 
way we did this is we actually have a

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:20.420 
way we did this is we actually have a
technical<00:00:18.900> program<00:00:19.080> as<00:00:19.500> well<00:00:20.070> as<00:00:20.160> a<00:00:20.189> more

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
technical program as well as a more

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.400 
technical program as well as a more
casual<00:00:20.850> urban<00:00:21.180> program<00:00:21.570> to<00:00:21.779> highlight<00:00:22.230> this

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
casual urban program to highlight this

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.099 
casual urban program to highlight this
so<00:00:22.619> the<00:00:23.400> the<00:00:23.880> basic<00:00:24.240> features<00:00:24.600> on<00:00:24.779> this<00:00:24.960> we

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
so the the basic features on this we

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:26.900 
so the the basic features on this we
were<00:00:25.230> trying<00:00:25.529> to<00:00:25.590> think<00:00:25.830> of<00:00:26.010> a<00:00:26.099> way<00:00:26.430> to<00:00:26.460> rethink

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
were trying to think of a way to rethink

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.939 
were trying to think of a way to rethink
shell<00:00:27.210> boots<00:00:27.510> shell<00:00:28.140> boots<00:00:28.349> tend<00:00:28.560> to<00:00:28.619> be<00:00:28.740> bulky

shell boots shell boots tend to be bulky
quite<00:00:29.369> heavy<00:00:29.609> and<00:00:29.880> also<00:00:30.480> very<00:00:30.689> hot<00:00:30.929> so<00:00:31.260> our

quite heavy and also very hot so our

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.350 
quite heavy and also very hot so our
rethink<00:00:32.219> of<00:00:32.309> this<00:00:32.399> was<00:00:32.610> to<00:00:32.790> try<00:00:32.969> and<00:00:33.030> get<00:00:33.180> this

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
rethink of this was to try and get this

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.020 
rethink of this was to try and get this
into<00:00:33.660> a<00:00:33.690> less<00:00:33.930> less<00:00:34.440> volume<00:00:34.920> this<00:00:35.190> piece<00:00:35.640> as

but the interesting part of this is a PU
coated<00:00:51.690> leather<00:00:51.840> upper<00:00:52.260> so<00:00:52.770> for<00:00:53.039> us<00:00:53.129> that's

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
coated leather upper so for us that's

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.720 
coated leather upper so for us that's
the<00:00:53.399> perfect<00:00:53.850> response<00:00:54.149> to<00:00:54.510> a<00:00:54.539> a<00:00:54.899> sort<00:00:55.530> of

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:55.730 
the perfect response to a a sort of

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:58.040 
the perfect response to a a sort of
waterproof<00:00:56.730> solution<00:00:57.329> that<00:00:57.510> without<00:00:57.899> the

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
waterproof solution that without the

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.660 
waterproof solution that without the
bulk<00:00:58.230> and<00:00:58.500> the<00:00:58.620> warmth<00:00:58.890> that<00:00:58.949> comes<00:00:59.309> with<00:00:59.520> it

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
bulk and the warmth that comes with it

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:01.779 
bulk and the warmth that comes with it
and<00:00:59.850> we<00:01:00.000> also<00:01:00.149> have<00:01:00.420> a<00:01:00.449> dual<00:01:00.750> density

00:01:01.779 --> 00:01:01.789 
and we also have a dual density

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:03.650 
and we also have a dual density
insulation<00:01:02.789> than<00:01:02.910> this<00:01:03.030> program<00:01:03.420> as<00:01:03.539> well

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:03.660 
insulation than this program as well

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.230 
insulation than this program as well
it's<00:01:03.840> 400<00:01:04.409> grams<00:01:04.619> right<00:01:04.890> now<00:01:05.070> so<00:01:05.640> super<00:01:06.000> warm

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
it's 400 grams right now so super warm

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.120 
it's 400 grams right now so super warm
but<00:01:06.390> at<00:01:06.479> the<00:01:06.570> same<00:01:06.720> time<00:01:06.930> it<00:01:07.619> has<00:01:07.890> two

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:08.130 
but at the same time it has two

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:09.859 
but at the same time it has two
densities<00:01:08.340> so<00:01:08.580> around<00:01:09.150> the<00:01:09.270> collar<00:01:09.479> and

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
densities so around the collar and

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:11.149 
densities so around the collar and
around<00:01:10.290> the<00:01:10.350> tongue<00:01:10.560> where<00:01:10.740> you<00:01:10.860> need<00:01:10.979> to<00:01:11.070> have

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159 
around the tongue where you need to have

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:12.620 
around the tongue where you need to have
that<00:01:11.280> extra<00:01:11.580> cushioning<00:01:11.939> that's<00:01:12.360> what<00:01:12.540> we

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:12.630 
that extra cushioning that's what we

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:14.109 
that extra cushioning that's what we
planned<00:01:12.869> in<00:01:12.990> there<00:01:13.140> so<00:01:13.290> just<00:01:13.439> a<00:01:13.590> great<00:01:13.799> package

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:14.119 
planned in there so just a great package

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:16.310 
planned in there so just a great package
men's<00:01:15.119> and<00:01:15.270> women's<00:01:15.360> solutions<00:01:15.960> really

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:16.320 
men's and women's solutions really

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.660 
men's and women's solutions really
distinct<00:01:16.740> between<00:01:16.830> a<00:01:17.009> performance<00:01:17.220> package

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670 
distinct between a performance package

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.820 
distinct between a performance package
and<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.479> technical<00:01:18.750> package<00:01:19.229> so<00:01:19.710> when

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
and the the technical package so when

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.289 
and the the technical package so when
Meryl<00:01:20.130> went<00:01:20.369> ahead<00:01:20.460> and<00:01:20.700> designed<00:01:21.030> this<00:01:21.240> new

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
Meryl went ahead and designed this new

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.210 
Meryl went ahead and designed this new
shoe<00:01:21.840> collection<00:01:22.170> what<00:01:22.590> niche<00:01:22.799> do<00:01:22.979> you<00:01:23.070> think

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
shoe collection what niche do you think

the<00:01:56.549> outsole<00:01:56.880> looks<00:01:57.119> pretty<00:01:57.390> aggressive<00:01:57.990> what

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
the outsole looks pretty aggressive what

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.660 
the outsole looks pretty aggressive what
sort<00:01:58.469> of<00:01:58.530> terrain<00:01:58.740> can<00:01:59.009> it<00:01:59.130> work<00:01:59.219> on<00:01:59.399> would<00:01:59.549> you

00:01:59.660 --> 00:01:59.670 
sort of terrain can it work on would you

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.730 
sort of terrain can it work on would you
say<00:01:59.850> we<00:02:00.420> really<00:02:00.689> planned<00:02:00.899> this<00:02:01.020> out<00:02:01.200> so<00:02:01.350> like<00:02:01.590> I

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
say we really planned this out so like I

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.469 
say we really planned this out so like I
mentioned<00:02:02.100> dual<00:02:02.399> densities<00:02:02.939> so<00:02:02.969> softer

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
mentioned dual densities so softer

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.030 
mentioned dual densities so softer
around<00:02:03.719> the<00:02:03.869> outside<00:02:04.290> and<00:02:04.530> really<00:02:04.590> harder

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
around the outside and really harder

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.530 
around the outside and really harder
down<00:02:05.189> the<00:02:05.340> middle<00:02:05.579> so<00:02:05.700> we<00:02:05.820> want<00:02:06.000> to<00:02:06.149> be<00:02:06.240> able<00:02:06.450> to

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:06.540 
down the middle so we want to be able to

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.240 
down the middle so we want to be able to
perform<00:02:06.689> on<00:02:07.020> all<00:02:07.140> types<00:02:07.380> of<00:02:07.500> terrain<00:02:07.680> so<00:02:08.009> ice

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
perform on all types of terrain so ice

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:11.059 
perform on all types of terrain so ice
is<00:02:08.390> really<00:02:09.390> needs<00:02:09.569> that<00:02:09.750> grip<00:02:10.050> snow<00:02:10.679> needs<00:02:10.920> a

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:11.069 
is really needs that grip snow needs a

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.520 
is really needs that grip snow needs a
bit<00:02:11.220> more<00:02:11.250> cushioning<00:02:11.849> and

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.530 
bit more cushioning and

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.250 
bit more cushioning and
in<00:02:13.040> traction<00:02:13.640> and<00:02:13.790> wet<00:02:14.510> surfaces<00:02:14.959> that<00:02:15.140> you'd

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260 
in traction and wet surfaces that you'd

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:16.690 
in traction and wet surfaces that you'd
encounter<00:02:15.530> for<00:02:15.770> example<00:02:16.069> in<00:02:16.160> a<00:02:16.220> shopping<00:02:16.580> mall

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:16.700 
encounter for example in a shopping mall

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:18.400 
encounter for example in a shopping mall
or<00:02:16.760> a<00:02:16.940> parking<00:02:17.270> lot<00:02:17.390> when<00:02:17.569> snow<00:02:17.810> does<00:02:18.020> melt<00:02:18.230> you

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
or a parking lot when snow does melt you

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:19.930 
or a parking lot when snow does melt you
need<00:02:18.560> a<00:02:18.590> lot<00:02:18.980> of<00:02:19.010> traction<00:02:19.430> on<00:02:19.490> that<00:02:19.640> as<00:02:19.760> well

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:19.940 
need a lot of traction on that as well

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:21.340 
need a lot of traction on that as well
so<00:02:20.120> it<00:02:20.209> tried<00:02:20.390> to<00:02:20.420> perform<00:02:20.930> on<00:02:21.020> all<00:02:21.170> of<00:02:21.260> those

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:21.350 
so it tried to perform on all of those

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:22.540 
so it tried to perform on all of those
which<00:02:21.560> is<00:02:21.680> quite<00:02:21.890> a<00:02:21.920> challenge<00:02:22.280> but<00:02:22.400> we've

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:22.550 
which is quite a challenge but we've

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:24.910 
which is quite a challenge but we've
succeeded<00:02:22.910> with<00:02:23.180> the<00:02:23.330> specific<00:02:24.319> dual<00:02:24.680> density

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
succeeded with the specific dual density

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.460 
succeeded with the specific dual density
