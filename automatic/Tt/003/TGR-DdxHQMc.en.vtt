is<00:03:01.650> genetics<00:03:02.540> significant<00:03:03.540> yes<00:03:03.810> but<00:03:04.620> God

00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:05.250 
is genetics significant yes but God

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:09.650 
is genetics significant yes but God
never<00:03:05.640> defines<00:03:06.180> us<00:03:06.360> as<00:03:06.569> a<00:03:06.599> body<00:03:08.090> he<00:03:09.090> defines<00:03:09.480> us

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:12.000 
as image bearers of God who have been

as image bearers of God who have been
given<00:03:12.360> the<00:03:12.660> treasure<00:03:13.019> of<00:03:13.319> a<00:03:13.739> body<00:03:13.950> that<00:03:14.069> will

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
given the treasure of a body that will

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.699 
given the treasure of a body that will
be<00:03:14.370> resurrected<00:03:15.120> one<00:03:15.239> day<00:03:15.510> to<00:03:15.989> serve<00:03:16.260> Him<00:03:16.500> and

be resurrected one day to serve Him and

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:21.080 
be resurrected one day to serve Him and
so<00:03:17.700> that's<00:03:18.090> why<00:03:18.830> it's<00:03:19.830> so<00:03:20.190> important<00:03:20.849> it's<00:03:21.000> not

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
so that's why it's so important it's not

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:24.259 
so that's why it's so important it's not
minimal<00:03:21.870> I<00:03:22.140> think<00:03:22.920> it<00:03:22.980> comes<00:03:23.220> from<00:03:23.430> the<00:03:23.940> idea

00:03:24.259 --> 00:03:24.269 
minimal I think it comes from the idea

00:03:24.269 --> 00:03:26.090 
minimal I think it comes from the idea
that<00:03:24.450> while<00:03:24.570> getting<00:03:24.780> saved<00:03:25.230> is<00:03:25.470> nice<00:03:25.680> for

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.100 
that while getting saved is nice for

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.759 
that while getting saved is nice for
eternity<00:03:26.700> now<00:03:27.269> we<00:03:27.329> get<00:03:27.540> about<00:03:27.750> life<00:03:28.019> know

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769 
eternity now we get about life know

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:30.949 
eternity now we get about life know
being<00:03:29.430> in<00:03:29.519> right<00:03:29.640> relationship<00:03:29.700> with<00:03:30.540> God<00:03:30.750> is

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
being in right relationship with God is

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:34.039 
being in right relationship with God is
the<00:03:31.109> core<00:03:31.410> everything<00:03:32.400> else<00:03:32.760> is<00:03:33.000> fringe<00:03:33.390> that

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:34.049 
the core everything else is fringe that

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:34.699 
the core everything else is fringe that
to<00:03:34.170> that<00:03:34.319> issue

00:03:34.699 --> 00:03:34.709 
to that issue

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:38.270 
to that issue
the<00:03:35.370> exciting<00:03:35.970> thing<00:03:36.470> the<00:03:37.470> Jay<00:03:37.650> Adams<00:03:37.950> said<00:03:38.190> at

00:03:38.270 --> 00:03:38.280 
the exciting thing the Jay Adams said at

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.009 
the exciting thing the Jay Adams said at
the<00:03:38.370> beginning<00:03:38.489> is<00:03:38.970> that<00:03:39.000> real<00:03:39.510> change<00:03:39.840> can

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:40.019 
the beginning is that real change can

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:41.000 
the beginning is that real change can
come<00:03:40.170> real<00:03:40.410> fast

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
come real fast

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.470 
come real fast
and<00:03:41.150> what<00:03:42.150> I'd<00:03:42.269> simply<00:03:42.480> have<00:03:42.780> to<00:03:42.900> say<00:03:43.109> is<00:03:43.350> yes

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480 
and what I'd simply have to say is yes

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:49.129 
and what I'd simply have to say is yes
look<00:03:45.480> at<00:03:45.630> Saul<00:03:46.470> on<00:03:46.799> the<00:03:46.859> Damascus<00:03:47.700> Road<00:03:48.139> and

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:49.139 
look at Saul on the Damascus Road and

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:51.229 
look at Saul on the Damascus Road and
you<00:03:49.230> can<00:03:49.410> say<00:03:49.560> to<00:03:49.680> me<00:03:49.829> well<00:03:50.100> skip<00:03:50.639> that's<00:03:50.819> true

00:03:51.229 --> 00:03:51.239 
you can say to me well skip that's true

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:54.410 
you can say to me well skip that's true
but<00:03:51.630> you<00:03:52.500> know<00:03:52.530> that's<00:03:52.799> rare<00:03:53.220> it<00:03:53.790> may<00:03:54.030> be<00:03:54.090> rare

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:54.420 
but you know that's rare it may be rare

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.120 
but you know that's rare it may be rare
and<00:03:54.450> that's<00:03:54.780> true<00:03:55.109> radical<00:03:55.680> changes<00:03:55.950> but

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
and that's true radical changes but

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:58.129 
and that's true radical changes but
we've<00:03:56.250> seen<00:03:56.519> people<00:03:57.030> who<00:03:57.450> walk<00:03:57.690> away<00:03:57.959> from

00:03:58.129 --> 00:03:58.139 
we've seen people who walk away from

00:03:58.139 --> 00:03:59.629 
we've seen people who walk away from
thirty<00:03:58.440> years<00:03:58.680> of<00:03:58.829> addiction<00:03:59.100> of<00:03:59.400> crack

00:03:59.629 --> 00:03:59.639 
thirty years of addiction of crack

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:03.530 
thirty years of addiction of crack
cocaine<00:03:59.880> and<00:04:00.359> never<00:04:00.900> ever<00:04:01.380> take<00:04:01.650> it<00:04:01.799> again<00:04:02.540> so

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
cocaine and never ever take it again so

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:06.500 
cocaine and never ever take it again so
a<00:04:03.569> rapid<00:04:04.560> change<00:04:04.590> can<00:04:05.190> come<00:04:05.370> not<00:04:06.000> everything

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:06.510 
a rapid change can come not everything

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.240 
a rapid change can come not everything
will<00:04:06.600> change<00:04:06.660> in<00:04:07.049> six<00:04:07.319> to<00:04:07.500> twelve<00:04:07.739> weeks

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:08.250 
will change in six to twelve weeks

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.099 
will change in six to twelve weeks
the<00:04:08.370> modification<00:04:09.150> would<00:04:09.299> be<00:04:09.450> this<00:04:09.630> is<00:04:09.690> that

00:04:10.099 --> 00:04:10.109 
the modification would be this is that

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:12.890 
the modification would be this is that
six<00:04:10.859> to<00:04:11.040> twelve<00:04:11.310> weeks<00:04:11.430> is<00:04:11.900> significant

00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:12.900 
six to twelve weeks is significant

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.110 
six to twelve weeks is significant
enough<00:04:12.989> to<00:04:13.920> find<00:04:14.220> out<00:04:14.430> whether<00:04:14.670> this<00:04:14.850> person

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120 
enough to find out whether this person

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:18.050 
enough to find out whether this person
is<00:04:15.450> serious<00:04:15.959> about<00:04:16.609> dealing<00:04:17.609> with<00:04:17.850> the

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060 
is serious about dealing with the

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:22.039 
is serious about dealing with the
problems<00:04:18.510> from<00:04:19.019> God's<00:04:19.320> perspective<00:04:20.419> so<00:04:21.419> the

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049 
problems from God's perspective so the

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:24.409 
problems from God's perspective so the
fact<00:04:22.320> that<00:04:22.440> the<00:04:22.620> New<00:04:22.740> Testament<00:04:22.770> says<00:04:23.669> such

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:24.419 
fact that the New Testament says such

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:25.400
