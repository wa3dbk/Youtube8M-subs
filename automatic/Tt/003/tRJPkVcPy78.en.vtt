00:00:39.889 --> 00:00:39.899 
really close together so the stitches

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:42.049 
really close together so the stitches
are<00:00:40.020> almost<00:00:40.290> on<00:00:40.410> top<00:00:40.559> of<00:00:40.739> each<00:00:40.860> other<00:00:41.070> but<00:00:41.940> it

kind<00:00:43.890> of<00:00:43.950> play<00:00:44.219> with<00:00:44.250> the<00:00:44.460> thickness<00:00:44.789> or<00:00:45.090> the

00:00:45.139 --> 00:00:45.149 
kind of play with the thickness or the

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:48.770 
kind of play with the thickness or the
width<00:00:45.390> of<00:00:45.510> that<00:00:45.570> stitch<00:00:45.989> and<00:00:46.399> explore<00:00:47.399> on<00:00:47.940> this

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
width of that stitch and explore on this

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.080 
width of that stitch and explore on this
little<00:00:48.930> piece<00:00:49.200> I<00:00:49.590> simply<00:00:50.250> wanted<00:00:50.550> to<00:00:50.610> make

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090 
little piece I simply wanted to make

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.990 
little piece I simply wanted to make
color<00:00:52.050> sit<00:00:52.469> on<00:00:52.590> top<00:00:52.890> of<00:00:53.100> everything<00:00:53.340> else<00:00:53.699> and

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
color sit on top of everything else and

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.270 
color sit on top of everything else and
so<00:00:54.270> to<00:00:54.329> do<00:00:54.780> that<00:00:55.050> I<00:00:55.350> needed<00:00:55.890> to<00:00:56.070> have<00:00:56.219> that

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
so to do that I needed to have that

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.369 
so to do that I needed to have that
threat<00:00:56.670> either<00:00:56.820> be<00:00:57.059> really<00:00:57.329> heavy<00:00:57.570> or<00:00:57.960> the

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
threat either be really heavy or the

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:01.010 
threat either be really heavy or the
stitch<00:00:58.649> be<00:00:58.890> rather<00:00:59.219> large<00:00:59.520> and<00:00:59.879> dense<00:01:00.090> so<00:01:00.989> I

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:01.020 
stitch be rather large and dense so I

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.709 
stitch be rather large and dense so I
chose<00:01:01.320> the<00:01:01.530> satin<00:01:01.890> stitch<00:01:02.129> I<00:01:02.539> outlined<00:01:03.539> to<00:01:03.629> the

00:01:03.709 --> 00:01:03.719 
chose the satin stitch I outlined to the

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:05.840 
chose the satin stitch I outlined to the
flower<00:01:03.989> with<00:01:04.500> a<00:01:04.530> much<00:01:04.769> thinner<00:01:05.100> satin<00:01:05.580> stitch

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
flower with a much thinner satin stitch

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.850 
flower with a much thinner satin stitch
and<00:01:06.210> then<00:01:06.780> started<00:01:07.170> getting<00:01:07.260> wider<00:01:07.590> in<00:01:07.830> the

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
and then started getting wider in the

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.250 
and then started getting wider in the
frame<00:01:08.280> and<00:01:08.610> wider<00:01:09.330> out<00:01:09.600> here<00:01:09.840> with<00:01:09.990> all<00:01:10.020> these

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260

frame and wider out here with all these
wonderful<00:01:10.680> undulating<00:01:11.250> lines<00:01:11.960> here<00:01:12.960> I'm

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
wonderful undulating lines here I'm

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.260 
wonderful undulating lines here I'm
using<00:01:13.350> that<00:01:13.710> stitch<00:01:14.130> not<00:01:14.610> just<00:01:14.909> to<00:01:15.030> quilt

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.270 
using that stitch not just to quilt

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:16.880 
using that stitch not just to quilt
things<00:01:15.479> together<00:01:15.659> but<00:01:16.080> as<00:01:16.259> a<00:01:16.290> design<00:01:16.710> element

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
things together but as a design element

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.800

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.210 
too I really had fun with this piece one
of<00:01:21.840> the<00:01:21.990> things<00:01:22.229> that's<00:01:22.439> really<00:01:22.530> really<00:01:22.950> cool

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
of the things that's really really cool

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.310 
of the things that's really really cool
about<00:01:24.030> changing<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:24.630> density<00:01:24.840> of<00:01:25.170> your

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
about changing the density of your

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.590 
about changing the density of your
stitch<00:01:25.740> is<00:01:25.979> that<00:01:26.340> you<00:01:26.880> can<00:01:27.030> create<00:01:27.299> different

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
stitch is that you can create different

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.710 
stitch is that you can create different
depths<00:01:28.439> or<00:01:28.560> planes<00:01:29.009> in<00:01:29.310> the<00:01:29.400> quilt<00:01:29.640> so<00:01:30.509> when<00:01:30.630> we

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
depths or planes in the quilt so when we

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.390 
depths or planes in the quilt so when we
look<00:01:30.900> at<00:01:31.020> this<00:01:31.229> we<00:01:31.470> can<00:01:31.500> see<00:01:31.650> automatically

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:32.400 
look at this we can see automatically

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.910 
look at this we can see automatically
that<00:01:33.150> the<00:01:33.270> circles<00:01:33.630> of<00:01:33.780> fabric<00:01:34.560> are<00:01:34.680> sitting

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
that the circles of fabric are sitting

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.649 
that the circles of fabric are sitting
on<00:01:34.979> top<00:01:35.310> so<00:01:35.579> they're<00:01:35.729> coming<00:01:36.000> closest<00:01:36.509> to<00:01:36.630> us

00:01:36.649 --> 00:01:36.659 
on top so they're coming closest to us

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.069 
on top so they're coming closest to us
and<00:01:37.140> they're<00:01:37.770> in<00:01:37.950> the<00:01:38.130> forward<00:01:38.700> space<00:01:39.119> but

00:01:40.069 --> 00:01:40.079 
and they're in the forward space but

00:01:40.079 --> 00:01:41.270 
and they're in the forward space but
when<00:01:40.200> we<00:01:40.290> check<00:01:40.530> out<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:40.829> two<00:01:40.979> different

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
when we check out the two different

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.160 
when we check out the two different
types<00:01:41.490> of<00:01:41.729> stitch<00:01:42.060> we've<00:01:42.540> got<00:01:42.750> the<00:01:42.990> regular

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170 
types of stitch we've got the regular

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:45.560 
types of stitch we've got the regular
stitch<00:01:43.619> line<00:01:43.890> done<00:01:44.640> with<00:01:44.790> a<00:01:44.820> regular<00:01:45.240> straight

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
stitch line done with a regular straight

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
lines so now we have three planes

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.130

design<00:02:22.800> and<00:02:23.100> so<00:02:23.760> I<00:02:23.790> thought<00:02:24.060> it<00:02:24.120> would<00:02:24.270> be

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:24.450 
design and so I thought it would be

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.600 
design and so I thought it would be
really<00:02:24.600> fun<00:02:24.900> to<00:02:24.930> just<00:02:25.500> put<00:02:26.010> one<00:02:26.250> decorative

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:26.610 
really fun to just put one decorative

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:29.150 
really fun to just put one decorative
stitch<00:02:26.910> in<00:02:27.090> there<00:02:27.240> and<00:02:27.450> so<00:02:27.900> I<00:02:27.930> chose<00:02:28.230> a<00:02:28.290> zig<00:02:28.620> zag

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
stitch in there and so I chose a zig zag

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:31.010 
stitch in there and so I chose a zig zag
now<00:02:29.550> you<00:02:29.610> can<00:02:29.880> quilt<00:02:30.120> with<00:02:30.240> a<00:02:30.270> zig<00:02:30.480> zag<00:02:30.510> all<00:02:30.870> you
