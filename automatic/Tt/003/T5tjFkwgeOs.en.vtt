00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.690 
we're going to continue on with our
basic<00:00:04.730> modeling<00:00:05.730> courses<00:00:06.390> in<00:00:06.660> cheetah<00:00:07.350> 3d<00:00:07.830> so

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:08.700 
basic modeling courses in cheetah 3d so

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.680 
basic modeling courses in cheetah 3d so
let<00:00:09.150> me<00:00:09.300> fire<00:00:09.540> up<00:00:09.570> cheetah<00:00:10.110> and<00:00:11.509> we're<00:00:12.509> gonna

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:12.690 
let me fire up cheetah and we're gonna

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:15.980 
let me fire up cheetah and we're gonna
start<00:00:13.049> with<00:00:13.200> our<00:00:13.410> basic<00:00:13.730> blank<00:00:14.730> screen<00:00:15.210> okay

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
start with our basic blank screen okay

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.680 
start with our basic blank screen okay
so<00:00:16.949> the<00:00:17.130> first<00:00:17.340> thing<00:00:17.520> that<00:00:17.789> I<00:00:17.820> want<00:00:18.119> to<00:00:18.210> do<00:00:18.359> is

so the first thing that I want to do is
I<00:00:19.500> want<00:00:19.680> to<00:00:19.710> create<00:00:19.949> a<00:00:20.070> spline<00:00:20.400> so<00:00:21.090> I'm<00:00:21.180> gonna

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
I want to create a spline so I'm gonna

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.580 
I want to create a spline so I'm gonna
go<00:00:21.449> up<00:00:21.539> to<00:00:21.660> tools<00:00:21.920> spline<00:00:22.939> create<00:00:23.939> spline<00:00:24.590> and

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
go up to tools spline create spline and

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.050 
go up to tools spline create spline and
this<00:00:26.160> will<00:00:26.369> allow<00:00:26.519> me<00:00:26.550> to<00:00:26.760> create<00:00:26.880> a<00:00:27.029> new

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:27.060 
this will allow me to create a new

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.630 
this will allow me to create a new
spline<00:00:27.480> now<00:00:28.140> I'm<00:00:28.260> gonna<00:00:28.410> go<00:00:28.590> to<00:00:28.619> my<00:00:28.830> front<00:00:29.220> view

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
spline now I'm gonna go to my front view

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:38.000 
spline now I'm gonna go to my front view
and<00:00:33.410> we're<00:00:34.410> going<00:00:34.770> to<00:00:36.590> make<00:00:37.590> a<00:00:37.649> glass

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:38.010 
and we're going to make a glass

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.600 
and we're going to make a glass
something<00:00:38.850> simple<00:00:39.239> something<00:00:39.480> easy<00:00:39.899> and<00:00:40.610> now

a fast easy tutorial I'm not gonna sit

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:41.539 
a fast easy tutorial I'm not gonna sit
and<00:01:36.780> tweak<00:01:36.990> with<00:01:37.170> it<00:01:37.320> too<00:01:38.070> much<00:01:40.340> good<00:01:41.340> enough

00:01:41.539 --> 00:01:41.549 
and tweak with it too much good enough

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:46.039 
and tweak with it too much good enough
so<00:01:42.240> now<00:01:42.659> what<00:01:42.930> I'm<00:01:43.020> gonna<00:01:43.170> do<00:01:43.439> is<00:01:44.720> yes<00:01:45.720> I<00:01:45.899> want

so now what I'm gonna do is yes I want
to<00:01:46.110> enter<00:01:46.290> my<00:01:46.320> tweet<00:01:46.649> mode<00:01:46.890> too<00:01:47.100> because<00:01:47.430> it

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:47.549 
to enter my tweet mode too because it

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.600 
to enter my tweet mode too because it
makes<00:01:47.729> things<00:01:47.880> a<00:01:48.030> lot<00:01:48.180> easier<00:01:48.240> to<00:01:48.659> adjust<00:01:49.610> this

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
makes things a lot easier to adjust this

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.749 
makes things a lot easier to adjust this
is<00:01:50.820> a<00:01:50.850> little<00:01:51.149> thick<00:01:51.420> for<00:01:51.630> my<00:01:51.750> taste<00:01:52.049> down<00:01:52.320> here

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
bring this one up and we'll just do them

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:22.860 
bring this one up and we'll just do them
all<00:02:15.370> this<00:02:15.580> way<00:02:15.820> and<00:02:20.940> just<00:02:21.940> take<00:02:22.120> them<00:02:22.270> all<00:02:22.420> up<00:02:22.600> a

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
all this way and just take them all up a

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:30.870 
all this way and just take them all up a
tad<00:02:23.200> here<00:02:26.970> take<00:02:27.970> this<00:02:28.240> one<00:02:28.890> and<00:02:29.890> this<00:02:30.310> one<00:02:30.610> and

tad here take this one and this one and
we'll<00:02:31.300> move<00:02:31.450> them<00:02:31.690> up<00:02:34.860> okay<00:02:35.860> so<00:02:36.460> now<00:02:36.580> we<00:02:36.640> have

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:36.730 
we'll move them up okay so now we have

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.400 
we'll move them up okay so now we have
this<00:02:36.940> basic<00:02:37.360> shape<00:02:37.390> what<00:02:37.840> are<00:02:37.900> we<00:02:37.990> gonna<00:02:38.140> do

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:38.410 
this basic shape what are we gonna do

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:40.620 
this basic shape what are we gonna do
well<00:02:39.160> I'm<00:02:39.340> gonna<00:02:39.460> go<00:02:39.640> up<00:02:39.760> to<00:02:39.910> selection<00:02:40.450> and

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
well I'm gonna go up to selection and

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:43.890 
well I'm gonna go up to selection and
pick<00:02:41.500> area<00:02:41.920> select<00:02:42.340> and<00:02:43.330> I'm<00:02:43.480> gonna<00:02:43.660> draw<00:02:43.870> a

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
pick area select and I'm gonna draw a

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:47.160 
pick area select and I'm gonna draw a
box<00:02:44.170> around<00:02:44.470> this<00:02:45.459> point<00:02:45.820> and<00:02:46.110> this<00:02:47.110> point

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:47.170 
box around this point and this point

box around this point and this point
down<00:02:47.560> here<00:02:47.620> like<00:02:48.250> this<00:02:48.870> and<00:02:49.870> that's<00:02:49.959> gonna

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.170 
down here like this and that's gonna

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:51.930 
down here like this and that's gonna
select<00:02:50.560> my<00:02:50.770> two<00:02:50.830> outer<00:02:51.160> points<00:02:51.640> because<00:02:51.880> I

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:51.940 
select my two outer points because I

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:53.400 
select my two outer points because I
need<00:02:52.090> to<00:02:52.180> set<00:02:52.360> the<00:02:52.480> value<00:02:52.780> for<00:02:52.959> this<00:02:53.080> points

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:53.410 
need to set the value for this points

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:58.040 
need to set the value for this points
because<00:02:53.680> I'm<00:02:53.830> going<00:02:54.010> to<00:02:54.130> lay<00:02:54.910> that<00:02:55.120> around

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:02.310 

okay<00:02:59.050> we've<00:02:59.740> got<00:02:59.920> that<00:03:00.160> go<00:03:01.120> up<00:03:01.209> the<00:03:01.240> tools<00:03:01.570> set

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:02.320 
okay we've got that go up the tools set

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:06.810 
okay we've got that go up the tools set
value<00:03:03.600> I'm<00:03:04.600> gonna<00:03:04.870> uncheck<00:03:05.380> my<00:03:05.440> set<00:03:05.950> X<00:03:06.250> in<00:03:06.760> my

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:06.820 
value I'm gonna uncheck my set X in my

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:14.730 
value I'm gonna uncheck my set X in my
set<00:03:07.600> Y<00:03:09.570> hit<00:03:10.570> okay<00:03:11.070> that<00:03:12.070> will<00:03:12.250> apply<00:03:12.490> it<00:03:13.230> now<00:03:14.230> we

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:14.740 
set Y hit okay that will apply it now we

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:19.890 
set Y hit okay that will apply it now we
can<00:03:14.920> go<00:03:15.070> back<00:03:15.100> to<00:03:15.310> our<00:03:18.209> camera<00:03:19.209> view<00:03:19.450> and<00:03:19.630> we

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:19.900 
can go back to our camera view and we

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.360 
can go back to our camera view and we
can<00:03:19.930> see<00:03:20.110> our<00:03:20.910> little<00:03:22.680> shape<00:03:23.680> there<00:03:23.980> so<00:03:24.280> I'm

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:24.370 
can see our little shape there so I'm

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:26.550 
can see our little shape there so I'm
gonna<00:03:24.459> go<00:03:24.550> up<00:03:24.670> to<00:03:24.760> my<00:03:24.790> creator<00:03:25.269> modifiers<00:03:26.200> and

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
gonna go up to my creator modifiers and

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:29.759 
gonna go up to my creator modifiers and
select<00:03:27.040> lathe<00:03:27.489> now<00:03:28.330> nothing<00:03:28.690> will<00:03:28.780> happen<00:03:28.959> so

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:29.769 
select lathe now nothing will happen so

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:32.040 
select lathe now nothing will happen so
I'll<00:03:29.890> drag<00:03:30.100> the<00:03:30.310> lathe<00:03:30.550> or<00:03:31.209> the<00:03:31.420> spline<00:03:31.690> and

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:32.050 
I'll drag the lathe or the spline and

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:35.390 
I'll drag the lathe or the spline and
drag<00:03:32.650> it<00:03:32.830> and<00:03:32.950> drop<00:03:33.040> it<00:03:33.430> on<00:03:33.580> the<00:03:33.940> lathe<00:03:34.120> and

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
drag it and drop it on the lathe and

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:41.009 
drag it and drop it on the lathe and
boom<00:03:37.170> so<00:03:38.170> now<00:03:38.350> as<00:03:38.560> you<00:03:38.590> can<00:03:38.769> see<00:03:38.920> I<00:03:39.840> have<00:03:40.840> this

00:03:41.009 --> 00:03:41.019 
boom so now as you can see I have this

00:03:41.019 --> 00:03:45.330 
boom so now as you can see I have this
basic<00:03:42.360> glass<00:03:43.360> it's<00:03:43.750> that<00:03:44.650> simple<00:03:44.920> to<00:03:45.100> make<00:03:45.310> a

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:45.340 
basic glass it's that simple to make a

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.979 
basic glass it's that simple to make a
glass<00:03:45.640> in<00:03:45.940> jito<00:03:48.480> we<00:03:49.480> could<00:03:49.630> add<00:03:49.720> a<00:03:49.750> material

00:03:49.979 --> 00:03:49.989 
glass in jito we could add a material

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:53.699 
glass in jito we could add a material
we'll<00:03:50.769> say<00:03:51.040> a<00:03:51.070> membrane<00:03:52.380> and<00:03:53.380> we'll<00:03:53.560> go<00:03:53.680> up

00:03:53.699 --> 00:03:53.709 
we'll say a membrane and we'll go up

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:58.080 
we'll say a membrane and we'll go up
here<00:03:54.040> and<00:03:54.070> we'll<00:03:54.250> make<00:03:54.310> it<00:03:54.600> white<00:03:56.790> like<00:03:57.790> that

00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:58.090 
here and we'll make it white like that

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:04.110 
here and we'll make it white like that
and<00:03:58.870> we'll<00:03:59.410> make<00:03:59.590> that<00:04:02.430> take<00:04:03.430> the<00:04:03.580> power<00:04:03.820> up

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120 
and we'll make that take the power up

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:07.020 
and we'll make that take the power up
and<00:04:04.390> we'll<00:04:04.620> have<00:04:05.620> the<00:04:06.160> transparency<00:04:06.580> all<00:04:06.940> the

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.030 
and we'll have the transparency all the

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:09.030 
and we'll have the transparency all the
way<00:04:07.120> up<00:04:07.330> and<00:04:07.959> we'll<00:04:08.110> take<00:04:08.260> the<00:04:08.410> threshold<00:04:08.890> to

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 
way up and we'll take the threshold to

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:13.140 
way up and we'll take the threshold to
about<00:04:09.220> 0.25

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.150 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:15.820 

now<00:04:14.150> this<00:04:14.330> is<00:04:14.450> about<00:04:14.630> as<00:04:14.840> good<00:04:15.050> as<00:04:15.170> it<00:04:15.319> closes

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:15.830 
now this is about as good as it closes

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:17.680 
now this is about as good as it closes
glass<00:04:16.400> material<00:04:16.970> you're<00:04:17.120> gonna<00:04:17.239> get<00:04:17.510> with

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:17.690 
glass material you're gonna get with

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:19.030 
glass material you're gonna get with
from<00:04:17.959> within<00:04:18.139> cheetah<00:04:18.530> unless<00:04:18.769> you<00:04:18.919> go<00:04:19.010> out

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:19.040 
from within cheetah unless you go out

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:20.409 
from within cheetah unless you go out
and<00:04:19.160> source<00:04:19.400> your<00:04:19.519> own<00:04:19.669> you<00:04:19.940> know<00:04:20.090> material

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:20.419 
and source your own you know material

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:22.240 
and source your own you know material
which<00:04:20.870> is<00:04:20.989> no<00:04:21.079> problem<00:04:21.530> but<00:04:21.680> I'm<00:04:21.799> just<00:04:21.919> using

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:22.250 
which is no problem but I'm just using

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:25.629 
which is no problem but I'm just using
what<00:04:22.370> cheetah<00:04:22.639> gives<00:04:22.910> us<00:04:23.889> see<00:04:24.889> here<00:04:25.340> let<00:04:25.610> me

00:04:25.629 --> 00:04:25.639 
what cheetah gives us see here let me

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:30.659 
what cheetah gives us see here let me
add<00:04:25.850> us<00:04:26.380> skylight<00:04:27.380> to<00:04:27.560> the<00:04:27.650> scene<00:04:28.120> rerender<00:04:29.120> it

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:30.669 
add us skylight to the scene rerender it

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:33.310 
add us skylight to the scene rerender it
and<00:04:31.669> then<00:04:31.910> we<00:04:32.090> have<00:04:32.210> our<00:04:32.330> little<00:04:32.570> shadow<00:04:32.810> here

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:33.320 
and then we have our little shadow here

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:35.530 
and then we have our little shadow here
as<00:04:34.130> you<00:04:34.250> can<00:04:34.280> see<00:04:34.430> now<00:04:34.940> let's<00:04:35.180> drag<00:04:35.389> our

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:35.540 
as you can see now let's drag our

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:38.620 
as you can see now let's drag our
membrane<00:04:35.990> on<00:04:36.139> top<00:04:36.760> as<00:04:37.760> you<00:04:37.790> can<00:04:38.120> see<00:04:38.300> there<00:04:38.510> and

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:38.630 
membrane on top as you can see there and

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:45.100 
membrane on top as you can see there and
render<00:04:38.930> again<00:04:43.300> now<00:04:44.300> it's<00:04:44.450> a<00:04:44.510> little<00:04:44.660> if<00:04:44.990> you

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:45.110 
render again now it's a little if you

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:49.409 
render again now it's a little if you
look<00:04:45.290> on<00:04:45.380> the<00:04:45.500> edges<00:04:45.979> there<00:04:46.160> let's<00:04:46.400> zoom<00:04:47.330> in

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:49.419 
look on the edges there let's zoom in

00:04:49.419 --> 00:05:01.899 
look on the edges there let's zoom in
like<00:04:50.419> so<00:04:51.310> let's<00:04:52.310> select<00:04:52.639> our<00:04:52.820> material

00:05:01.899 --> 00:05:01.909 

00:05:01.909 --> 00:05:03.969 

let's<00:05:02.449> render<00:05:02.689> now<00:05:03.649> that<00:05:03.800> we're<00:05:03.889> a<00:05:03.919> little

00:05:03.969 --> 00:05:03.979 
let's render now that we're a little

00:05:03.979 --> 00:05:09.250 
let's render now that we're a little
closer

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:09.260 

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.170 

now<00:05:09.890> as<00:05:10.010> you<00:05:10.130> can<00:05:10.250> see<00:05:10.490> we<00:05:10.640> got<00:05:10.730> a<00:05:10.790> little<00:05:10.970> bit

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:11.180 
now as you can see we got a little bit

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:13.810 
now as you can see we got a little bit
of<00:05:11.270> a<00:05:11.330> glass<00:05:11.600> effect<00:05:12.110> coming<00:05:12.470> in<00:05:12.650> here<00:05:12.920> which

00:05:13.810 --> 00:05:13.820 
of a glass effect coming in here which

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:15.100 
of a glass effect coming in here which
we<00:05:13.970> need<00:05:14.150> to<00:05:14.240> tweak<00:05:14.360> a<00:05:14.450> little<00:05:14.540> bit<00:05:14.810> more<00:05:14.990> which

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:15.110 
we need to tweak a little bit more which

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:16.330 
we need to tweak a little bit more which
is<00:05:15.140> not<00:05:15.320> a<00:05:15.350> problem<00:05:15.710> I<00:05:15.770> just<00:05:15.800> wanted<00:05:15.950> to<00:05:16.190> give

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:16.340 
is not a problem I just wanted to give

00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:17.920 
is not a problem I just wanted to give
you<00:05:16.370> the<00:05:16.550> basic<00:05:16.850> idea<00:05:16.970> of<00:05:17.270> what's<00:05:17.510> going<00:05:17.750> on

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:17.930 
you the basic idea of what's going on

00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:23.050 
you the basic idea of what's going on
here<00:05:20.410> but<00:05:21.410> I<00:05:21.620> to<00:05:22.340> be<00:05:22.430> honest<00:05:22.670> with<00:05:22.820> you<00:05:22.910> I<00:05:22.970> don't

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:23.060 
here but I to be honest with you I don't

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:25.900 
here but I to be honest with you I don't
do<00:05:23.450> any<00:05:23.750> much<00:05:24.290> of<00:05:24.530> that<00:05:24.710> inside<00:05:25.220> of<00:05:25.250> Cheeta

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:25.910 
do any much of that inside of Cheeta

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:27.610 
do any much of that inside of Cheeta
I<00:05:26.000> usually<00:05:26.360> go<00:05:26.480> to<00:05:26.510> Houdini<00:05:26.960> for<00:05:27.200> that<00:05:27.320> stuff

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:27.620 
I usually go to Houdini for that stuff

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:36.400 
I usually go to Houdini for that stuff
and<00:05:33.340> let's<00:05:34.340> render<00:05:34.550> again<00:05:34.990> I'm<00:05:35.990> just<00:05:36.200> tweaking

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:36.410 
and let's render again I'm just tweaking

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:38.200 
and let's render again I'm just tweaking
fiddling<00:05:36.920> around<00:05:37.010> here<00:05:37.400> now<00:05:37.550> as<00:05:37.730> you<00:05:37.880> can<00:05:38.030> see

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:38.210 
fiddling around here now as you can see

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:44.440 
fiddling around here now as you can see
we<00:05:38.360> have<00:05:38.510> a<00:05:38.540> really<00:05:39.730> really<00:05:42.970> glassy<00:05:43.970> or<00:05:44.000> almost

00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:44.450 
we have a really really glassy or almost

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:49.300 
we have a really really glassy or almost
ghost<00:05:45.250> look<00:05:46.960> to<00:05:47.960> our<00:05:48.110> render<00:05:48.290> now<00:05:48.590> that<00:05:49.220> I've

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:49.310 
ghost look to our render now that I've

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:51.690 
ghost look to our render now that I've
adjusted<00:05:49.430> the<00:05:49.790> threshold<00:05:50.300> down<00:05:50.450> to<00:05:50.660> nothing

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:51.700 
adjusted the threshold down to nothing

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:54.310 
adjusted the threshold down to nothing
this<00:05:52.700> is<00:05:52.880> this<00:05:53.060> is<00:05:53.270> the<00:05:53.390> basic<00:05:53.780> this<00:05:53.930> is<00:05:54.110> the

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:54.320 
this is this is the basic this is the

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:55.660 
this is this is the basic this is the
clothes<00:05:54.530> you're<00:05:54.710> gonna<00:05:54.830> get<00:05:55.010> the<00:05:55.160> glass<00:05:55.400> and

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:55.670 
clothes you're gonna get the glass and

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:57.130 
clothes you're gonna get the glass and
cheated<00:05:55.940> without<00:05:56.210> Bert<00:05:56.480> source<00:05:56.810> on<00:05:56.930> your<00:05:57.050> own

00:05:57.130 --> 00:05:57.140 
cheated without Bert source on your own

00:05:57.140 --> 00:05:59.080 
cheated without Bert source on your own
material<00:05:57.590> but<00:05:58.130> what<00:05:58.280> I've<00:05:58.370> done<00:05:58.580> was<00:05:58.790> I<00:05:58.910> just

00:05:59.080 --> 00:05:59.090 
material but what I've done was I just

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:01.090 
material but what I've done was I just
exported<00:05:59.750> this<00:05:59.840> little<00:06:00.110> glass<00:06:00.260> as<00:06:00.530> an<00:06:00.620> obj

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:01.100 
exported this little glass as an obj

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:04.300 
exported this little glass as an obj
sent<00:06:01.970> it<00:06:02.120> to<00:06:02.270> Houdini<00:06:02.750> and<00:06:03.140> now<00:06:03.770> as<00:06:04.010> you<00:06:04.040> can

00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:04.310 
sent it to Houdini and now as you can

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:06.310 
sent it to Houdini and now as you can
see<00:06:04.550> here<00:06:05.000> let<00:06:05.180> me<00:06:05.270> zoom<00:06:05.480> in<00:06:05.720> that<00:06:05.900> was<00:06:06.050> a<00:06:06.080> quick

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:06.320 
see here let me zoom in that was a quick

00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:15.460 
see here let me zoom in that was a quick
render<00:06:06.530> here<00:06:09.790> you<00:06:10.790> zoom<00:06:11.030> in<00:06:11.210> here

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:15.470 

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:18.400 

now<00:06:16.010> if<00:06:16.070> I<00:06:16.190> grab<00:06:16.460> a<00:06:16.490> quick<00:06:16.760> render<00:06:16.970> of<00:06:17.210> this<00:06:17.420> you

00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:18.410 
now if I grab a quick render of this you

00:06:18.410 --> 00:06:20.350 
now if I grab a quick render of this you
can<00:06:18.560> see<00:06:18.800> the<00:06:18.980> glass<00:06:19.160> texturing<00:06:19.760> and<00:06:19.820> stuff<00:06:20.210> in

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:20.360 
can see the glass texturing and stuff in

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:24.250 
can see the glass texturing and stuff in
Houdini<00:06:20.840> is<00:06:21.140> just<00:06:21.820> wow<00:06:22.820> you<00:06:23.600> know<00:06:23.750> I<00:06:23.960> mean<00:06:24.110> look

00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:24.260 
Houdini is just wow you know I mean look

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.320 
Houdini is just wow you know I mean look
at<00:06:24.350> that<00:06:24.410> that<00:06:24.740> looks<00:06:24.950> like<00:06:25.100> real<00:06:25.610> glass<00:06:26.000> I

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:26.330 
at that that looks like real glass I

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:30.100 
at that that looks like real glass I
mean<00:06:26.840> Houdini<00:06:27.320> I<00:06:27.560> just<00:06:28.010> I<00:06:28.540> can't<00:06:29.540> get<00:06:29.810> over<00:06:29.870> it

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:30.110 
mean Houdini I just I can't get over it

00:06:30.110 --> 00:06:32.140 
mean Houdini I just I can't get over it
if<00:06:30.740> you<00:06:30.950> can<00:06:31.100> model<00:06:31.490> in<00:06:31.580> Houdini<00:06:31.880> the

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:32.150 
if you can model in Houdini the

00:06:32.150 --> 00:06:34.390 
if you can model in Houdini the
procedural<00:06:32.690> modeling<00:06:33.320> is<00:06:33.530> just<00:06:33.560> so<00:06:34.100> powerful

00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:34.400 
procedural modeling is just so powerful

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:38.530 
procedural modeling is just so powerful
you<00:06:35.390> know<00:06:36.640> so<00:06:37.640> we're<00:06:37.970> gonna<00:06:38.090> get<00:06:38.360> into

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:38.540 
you know so we're gonna get into

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:40.390 
you know so we're gonna get into
procedural<00:06:39.140> modeling<00:06:39.470> in<00:06:39.620> Houdini<00:06:39.890> I'm<00:06:40.220> just

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:40.400 
procedural modeling in Houdini I'm just

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:41.950 
procedural modeling in Houdini I'm just
trying<00:06:40.610> to<00:06:40.670> cover<00:06:40.910> the<00:06:41.120> modeling<00:06:41.540> in<00:06:41.690> cheetah

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:41.960 
trying to cover the modeling in cheetah

00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:43.690 
trying to cover the modeling in cheetah
first<00:06:42.230> because<00:06:42.530> it's<00:06:42.710> the<00:06:42.860> basic<00:06:43.340> and<00:06:43.520> most

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:43.700 
first because it's the basic and most

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:45.910 
first because it's the basic and most
well-known<00:06:44.000> way<00:06:44.420> to<00:06:44.480> model<00:06:44.900> it<00:06:45.320> models<00:06:45.740> like

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:45.920 
well-known way to model it models like

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:47.620 
well-known way to model it models like
maiya<00:06:46.160> and<00:06:46.520> other<00:06:46.640> applications

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:47.630 
maiya and other applications

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:49.930 
maiya and other applications
Houdini<00:06:48.470> is<00:06:48.680> unique<00:06:49.070> and<00:06:49.310> you<00:06:49.400> can<00:06:49.550> pull<00:06:49.760> off

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:49.940 
Houdini is unique and you can pull off

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:52.210 
Houdini is unique and you can pull off
some<00:06:50.240> really<00:06:50.690> unique<00:06:50.840> stefanini<00:06:51.650> and<00:06:51.770> we'll

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:52.220 
some really unique stefanini and we'll

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:54.100 
some really unique stefanini and we'll
get<00:06:52.370> to<00:06:52.520> that<00:06:52.550> but<00:06:52.880> let's<00:06:53.300> cover<00:06:53.480> the<00:06:53.660> basics

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:54.110 
get to that but let's cover the basics

00:06:54.110 --> 00:07:00.010 
get to that but let's cover the basics
of<00:06:55.660> the<00:06:56.660> mass<00:06:56.960> majority<00:06:57.590> first<00:06:58.550> okay<00:06:58.940> so<00:06:59.570> don't

00:07:00.010 --> 00:07:00.020 
of the mass majority first okay so don't

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:01.690 
of the mass majority first okay so don't
worry<00:07:00.140> about<00:07:00.410> modeling<00:07:00.770> Houdini<00:07:01.130> will<00:07:01.490> get

00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:01.700 
worry about modeling Houdini will get

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:04.090 
worry about modeling Houdini will get
there<00:07:01.970> that<00:07:02.300> is<00:07:02.510> an<00:07:02.660> art<00:07:02.900> all<00:07:03.110> on<00:07:03.350> its<00:07:03.500> own<00:07:03.680> and

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:04.100 
there that is an art all on its own and

00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:05.860 
there that is an art all on its own and
it<00:07:04.190> takes<00:07:04.400> a<00:07:04.550> little<00:07:04.700> bit<00:07:04.880> of<00:07:04.940> different

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:05.870 
it takes a little bit of different

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:07.750 
it takes a little bit of different
thinking<00:07:06.230> process<00:07:06.740> because<00:07:07.190> it<00:07:07.700> is

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:07.760 
thinking process because it is

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:09.490 
thinking process because it is
procedural<00:07:08.300> and<00:07:08.720> once<00:07:09.080> you<00:07:09.140> get<00:07:09.230> your<00:07:09.290> head

00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:09.500 
procedural and once you get your head

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:10.930 
procedural and once you get your head
wrapped<00:07:09.650> around<00:07:09.800> it<00:07:10.040> the<00:07:10.130> tools<00:07:10.430> of<00:07:10.580> Houdini

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:10.940 
wrapped around it the tools of Houdini

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:12.820 
wrapped around it the tools of Houdini
can<00:07:11.060> be<00:07:11.180> a<00:07:11.210> little<00:07:11.420> different<00:07:11.630> but<00:07:12.230> man<00:07:12.590> it's

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:12.830 
can be a little different but man it's

00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:15.100 
can be a little different but man it's
so<00:07:13.070> powerful<00:07:13.450> really<00:07:14.450> the<00:07:14.630> only<00:07:14.750> reason<00:07:14.930> I

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:15.110 
so powerful really the only reason I

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:16.390 
so powerful really the only reason I
came<00:07:15.170> into<00:07:15.380> Houdini<00:07:15.740> was<00:07:15.920> to<00:07:16.010> show<00:07:16.190> you<00:07:16.250> this

00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:16.400 
came into Houdini was to show you this

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:18.910 
came into Houdini was to show you this
great<00:07:16.700> model<00:07:17.120> I<00:07:17.390> made<00:07:17.540> in<00:07:17.720> cheetah<00:07:17.960> textured

00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:18.920 
great model I made in cheetah textured

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:20.890 
great model I made in cheetah textured
in<00:07:19.040> Houdini<00:07:19.430> and<00:07:19.700> look<00:07:19.940> we've<00:07:20.240> wound<00:07:20.480> up<00:07:20.690> with

00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:20.900 
in Houdini and look we've wound up with

00:07:20.900 --> 00:07:24.670 
in Houdini and look we've wound up with
a<00:07:20.930> wonderful<00:07:21.490> looking<00:07:22.540> wineglass<00:07:23.560> thanks<00:07:24.560> for

00:07:24.670 --> 00:07:24.680 
a wonderful looking wineglass thanks for

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:28.240 
a wonderful looking wineglass thanks for
watching<00:07:24.950> guys<00:07:25.100> we'll<00:07:25.610> see<00:07:25.790> you<00:07:25.850> next<00:07:26.000> time
