00:00:37.730 --> 00:01:14.600
 mister you have mercy all on the a6 

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.200
 kim tillie 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:02:14.599
 i know everything but in french window in new 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:36.380
 york in exciting league and 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:36.380
 expensive 

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:49.220
 I suppose that this autumn had to 

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:50.450
 to satisfy a little bit of a hassle 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.790
 that I have lost some time 

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:54.020
 but then from that I ended up 

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:55.480
 the back guard in the courts 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.830
 do not go too far 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.900
 favorite follow jean-louis in his 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:01.010
 progression 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:04.620
 in fact I ate the shot at kilometer 

00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:07.349
 jean-mi took me a little speed no to 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:09.120
 the end of the last turn but the view - 

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:12.329
 who have super good watch over him 

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:13.170
 to finish it's perfect is what you 

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:13.700
 think you're beaten by best 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.379
 today 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.760
 well let's say maybe have no better 

00:03:16.379 --> 00:03:19.609
 but certainly a horse that is more 

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.659
 in more in condition 

00:03:19.609 --> 00:03:23.459
 so I think as we are in 

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:24.659
 the best goodbyes in fifteen 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:30.870
 days to do what in 15 days I 

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:31.889
 will ask you and especially at the level of 

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:33.030
 her looks she looked perfect 

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:33.420
 so that's what reassures us 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.190
 totally 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.049
 it's after a news event we had 

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:38.400
 some little worries so I'm doing 

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:39.690
 a lot of care took our time and 

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.609
 that is to say to return to order 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:43.170
 so much better she has a lot further no 

00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:45.010
 this is a very good mare the 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:46.510
 new race race yesterday 

00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.709
 winter is still long we are still 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:49.090
 far still but we will take 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:52.870
 our time and we will try to prepare 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:55.470
 autocon stiller I hope that part 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:55.470
 some progress
