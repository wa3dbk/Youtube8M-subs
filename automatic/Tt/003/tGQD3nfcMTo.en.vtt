in<00:00:08.559> my<00:00:08.740> opinion<00:00:08.769> the<00:00:09.519> Rome<00:00:10.270> 390<00:00:11.200> is<00:00:11.380> one<00:00:12.130> of<00:00:12.220> the

00:00:12.270 --> 00:00:12.280 
in my opinion the Rome 390 is one of the

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:14.970 
in my opinion the Rome 390 is one of the
best<00:00:12.519> freestyle<00:00:13.420> snowboard<00:00:13.900> bindings<00:00:14.590> ever

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:14.980 
best freestyle snowboard bindings ever

00:00:14.980 --> 00:00:17.279 
best freestyle snowboard bindings ever
built<00:00:15.480> first<00:00:16.480> things<00:00:16.689> first<00:00:16.779> with<00:00:17.080> all<00:00:17.199> the

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:17.289 
built first things first with all the

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:19.200 
built first things first with all the
role<00:00:17.439> bindings<00:00:17.890> it's<00:00:18.159> a<00:00:18.249> hybrid<00:00:18.579> binding<00:00:18.970> so

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:19.210 
role bindings it's a hybrid binding so

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:20.550 
role bindings it's a hybrid binding so
that<00:00:19.300> means<00:00:19.539> that<00:00:19.810> it's<00:00:19.929> composed<00:00:20.259> of<00:00:20.320> a

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:20.560 
that means that it's composed of a

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:22.560 
that means that it's composed of a
polycarbonate<00:00:21.070> base<00:00:21.339> plate<00:00:21.609> and<00:00:21.849> an<00:00:22.179> aluminum

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:26.439 
with a polycarbonate base plate is it

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:29.279 
with a polycarbonate base plate is it
allows<00:00:26.679> a<00:00:27.009> flow<00:00:27.759> of<00:00:27.789> even<00:00:28.659> flax<00:00:28.989> throughout

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:32.950 
any dead spots with it so it allows it

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:34.860 
any dead spots with it so it allows it

the<00:00:35.019> big<00:00:35.199> advantage<00:00:35.230> with<00:00:35.800> all<00:00:35.920> the<00:00:36.010> realm

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:36.190 
the big advantage with all the realm

can see their advantage there being when
you<00:00:43.210> think<00:00:43.269> about<00:00:43.510> it<00:00:43.809> is<00:00:44.079> if<00:00:44.350> you're<00:00:44.379> leaning

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:44.800 
you think about it is if you're leaning

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.889 
you think about it is if you're leaning
back<00:00:45.039> your<00:00:45.489> board<00:00:45.760> is<00:00:46.000> actually<00:00:46.449> being<00:00:46.570> pulled

up by the binding when you're leaning

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:49.290 
up by the binding when you're leaning
forward<00:00:48.309> it's<00:00:48.429> actually<00:00:48.730> pushing<00:00:48.940> into<00:00:49.210> the

00:00:49.290 --> 00:00:49.300 
forward it's actually pushing into the

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:50.880 
forward it's actually pushing into the
binding<00:00:49.660> so<00:00:49.989> just<00:00:50.170> a<00:00:50.230> little<00:00:50.440> bit<00:00:50.530> more<00:00:50.710> energy

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:50.890 
binding so just a little bit more energy
