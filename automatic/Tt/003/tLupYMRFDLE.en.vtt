00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:05.780 

okay<00:00:02.760> so<00:00:02.820> if<00:00:03.419> you<00:00:03.629> look<00:00:03.870> below<00:00:04.080> this<00:00:04.980> is<00:00:05.279> the

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:05.790 
okay so if you look below this is the

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.799 
okay so if you look below this is the
light<00:00:06.000> meter<00:00:06.270> the<00:00:06.750> range<00:00:07.319> of<00:00:07.740> minus<00:00:08.580> 2<00:00:08.820> to<00:00:09.330> plus

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
light meter the range of minus 2 to plus

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:13.940 
light meter the range of minus 2 to plus
2<00:00:10.380> and<00:00:10.759> right<00:00:11.759> now<00:00:11.880> it<00:00:12.179> is<00:00:12.210> underexposed<00:00:12.950> I'm

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
2 and right now it is underexposed I'm

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.160 
2 and right now it is underexposed I'm
gonna<00:00:14.130> adjust<00:00:14.309> my<00:00:14.910> shutter<00:00:15.240> speed<00:00:15.330> this<00:00:15.900> is<00:00:16.049> in

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
gonna adjust my shutter speed this is in

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:22.070 
gonna adjust my shutter speed this is in
manual<00:00:16.500> mode<00:00:16.760> if<00:00:17.760> I<00:00:19.250> try<00:00:20.250> to<00:00:20.689> make<00:00:21.689> the<00:00:21.869> shutter

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
manual mode if I try to make the shutter

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.200 
manual mode if I try to make the shutter
speed<00:00:22.170> too<00:00:22.410> fast<00:00:22.740> it<00:00:23.220> blinks<00:00:23.760> letting<00:00:24.119> me<00:00:24.180> know

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.210 
speed too fast it blinks letting me know

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.330 
speed too fast it blinks letting me know
that<00:00:24.449> it's<00:00:24.539> gonna<00:00:24.660> be<00:00:24.869> too<00:00:25.039> underexposed<00:00:26.039> but

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:26.340 
that it's gonna be too underexposed but

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:30.109 
that it's gonna be too underexposed but
if<00:00:26.430> I<00:00:26.750> decrease<00:00:27.750> my<00:00:27.869> shutter<00:00:28.289> speed<00:00:28.380> and<00:00:29.310> I

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:30.119 
if I decrease my shutter speed and I

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.189 
if I decrease my shutter speed and I
slow<00:00:30.390> it<00:00:30.510> down<00:00:30.539> and<00:00:30.750> you'll<00:00:30.869> see<00:00:30.990> that<00:00:31.109> it

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199 
slow it down and you'll see that it

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:33.049 
slow it down and you'll see that it
comes<00:00:31.380> back<00:00:31.650> towards<00:00:32.070> the<00:00:32.189> 7th<00:00:32.520> point<00:00:32.730> and<00:00:32.940> the

00:00:33.049 --> 00:00:33.059 
comes back towards the 7th point and the

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:35.150 
comes back towards the 7th point and the
center<00:00:33.210> point<00:00:33.510> is<00:00:33.809> what<00:00:34.410> the<00:00:34.440> camera<00:00:34.829> thinks

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
center point is what the camera thinks

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:38.479 
center point is what the camera thinks
is<00:00:35.309> the<00:00:35.700> ideal<00:00:36.149> exposure<00:00:36.899> so<00:00:37.860> right<00:00:38.070> now<00:00:38.219> we're

00:00:38.479 --> 00:00:38.489 
is the ideal exposure so right now we're

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:42.290 
is the ideal exposure so right now we're
at<00:00:38.579> 1<00:00:38.790> second<00:00:39.180> exposure<00:00:39.510> at<00:00:40.140> f/8<00:00:40.620> now<00:00:41.460> I<00:00:41.850> could

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
at 1 second exposure at f/8 now I could

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.729 
at 1 second exposure at f/8 now I could
get<00:00:42.870> a<00:00:43.079> an<00:00:43.410> even<00:00:43.800> exposure<00:00:44.129> with<00:00:44.430> a<00:00:44.460> different

00:00:45.729 --> 00:00:45.739 
get a an even exposure with a different

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:47.930 
get a an even exposure with a different
aperture<00:00:46.739> setting<00:00:47.039> notice<00:00:47.430> that<00:00:47.760> the

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940 
aperture setting notice that the

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:49.639 
aperture setting notice that the
aperture<00:00:48.180> is<00:00:48.420> opening<00:00:48.840> and<00:00:49.050> it's<00:00:49.230> down<00:00:49.469> to

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
aperture is opening and it's down to

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:53.900 
aperture is opening and it's down to
five<00:00:49.829> point<00:00:50.129> six<00:00:50.370> now<00:00:50.820> the<00:00:51.780> reading<00:00:52.379> is<00:00:52.910> about

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
five point six now the reading is about

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:59.200 
five point six now the reading is about
one<00:00:54.270> stop<00:00:54.510> overexposed<00:00:55.379> so<00:00:56.809> if<00:00:57.809> I<00:00:57.960> adjust<00:00:58.079> my

00:00:59.200 --> 00:00:59.210 
one stop overexposed so if I adjust my

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:03.110 
one stop overexposed so if I adjust my
my<00:01:00.289> exposure<00:01:01.289> time<00:01:01.620> in<00:01:01.940> combination<00:01:02.940> with

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
my exposure time in combination with

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.590 
my exposure time in combination with
that<00:01:03.270> aperture<00:01:04.159> it<00:01:05.159> would<00:01:05.369> be<00:01:05.519> about<00:01:05.850> a<00:01:06.210> half

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
that aperture it would be about a half

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.060 
that aperture it would be about a half
second<00:01:07.110> ff6

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070 
second ff6

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.990 
second ff6
that<00:01:08.820> would<00:01:09.890> allow<00:01:10.890> me<00:01:11.070> to<00:01:11.250> have<00:01:11.400> what<00:01:11.909> the

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.000 
that would allow me to have what the

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.960 
that would allow me to have what the
camera<00:01:12.270> thinks<00:01:12.540> is<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:13.530> proper<00:01:13.860> exposure<00:01:14.220> now

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970 
camera thinks is the proper exposure now

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.020 
camera thinks is the proper exposure now
likewise<00:01:15.360> the<00:01:16.110> other<00:01:16.259> portion<00:01:17.040> that<00:01:17.490> impacts

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
likewise the other portion that impacts

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:21.800 
likewise the other portion that impacts
the<00:01:18.240> light<00:01:18.780> meter<00:01:18.990> is<00:01:19.790> your<00:01:20.790> ISO<00:01:20.970> so<00:01:21.390> if<00:01:21.509> I<00:01:21.600> were

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
the light meter is your ISO so if I were

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.810 
the light meter is your ISO so if I were
to<00:01:23.720> increase<00:01:24.720> my<00:01:25.080> height<00:01:25.110> at<00:01:25.380> a<00:01:25.439> 400<00:01:25.979> then<00:01:26.430> it

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
to increase my height at a 400 then it

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:28.700 
to increase my height at a 400 then it
would<00:01:26.939> be<00:01:27.030> overexposed<00:01:27.330> because<00:01:28.140> the<00:01:28.350> sensor

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
would be overexposed because the sensor

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.060 
would be overexposed because the sensor
is<00:01:29.479> more<00:01:30.479> sensitive<00:01:30.840> to<00:01:31.049> light<00:01:31.079> so<00:01:31.590> I<00:01:31.619> need

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
is more sensitive to light so I need

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:37.490 
is more sensitive to light so I need
less<00:01:32.880> time<00:01:33.439> to<00:01:34.820> expose<00:01:35.820> so<00:01:36.810> now<00:01:36.960> we're<00:01:37.110> down<00:01:37.229> to

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:37.500 
less time to expose so now we're down to

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.640 
less time to expose so now we're down to
a<00:01:37.530> fourth<00:01:37.950> of<00:01:38.009> a<00:01:38.100> second<00:01:38.430> so<00:01:39.390> that's<00:01:40.110> that's

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
a fourth of a second so that's that's

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.870 
a fourth of a second so that's that's
how<00:01:40.890> you<00:01:40.979> can<00:01:41.340> in<00:01:41.700> manual<00:01:42.060> mode<00:01:42.090> see<00:01:42.780> a<00:01:43.259> live

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
and that center point is is your target

and that center point is is your target
some<00:01:51.299> some<00:01:51.689> cameras<00:01:52.110> do<00:01:54.200> produce<00:01:55.200> images<00:01:55.409> a

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
some some cameras do produce images a

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.380 
some some cameras do produce images a
little<00:01:55.740> bit<00:01:56.009> better<00:01:56.159> when<00:01:56.430> it's<00:01:56.610> a<00:01:56.969> little

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:57.390 
little bit better when it's a little

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:00.980 
little bit better when it's a little

underexposed meaning just a hair under

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.889 
underexposed meaning just a hair under
in<00:02:01.560> this<00:02:01.680> case<00:02:01.890> it's<00:02:02.070> a<00:02:02.189> third<00:02:02.399> of<00:02:02.549> a<00:02:02.610> stop

in this case it's a third of a stop

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:07.130 
in this case it's a third of a stop
under<00:02:03.899> and<00:02:04.310> some<00:02:05.310> situations<00:02:05.869> benefit<00:02:06.869> from
