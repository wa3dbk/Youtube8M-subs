00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
six percent of GD if you look at the

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:40.490 
six percent of GD if you look at the
total<00:01:39.240> debt<00:01:39.450> that's<00:01:39.689> offered<00:01:40.140> by<00:01:40.470> the

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:40.500 
total debt that's offered by the

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.800 
total debt that's offered by the
Treasury<00:01:41.009> the<00:01:41.220> total<00:01:41.670> percentage<00:01:42.240> what

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
Treasury the total percentage what

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.330 
Treasury the total percentage what
percentage<00:01:43.350> do<00:01:43.710> you<00:01:43.770> think<00:01:43.860> is<00:01:44.130> an<00:01:44.250> acceptable

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
percentage do you think is an acceptable

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.830 
percentage do you think is an acceptable
level<00:01:45.079> level<00:01:46.159> well<00:01:47.159> I<00:01:47.189> think<00:01:47.369> that

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
level level well I think that

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:50.719 
level level well I think that
importantly<00:01:48.840> at<00:01:49.229> this<00:01:49.560> stage<00:01:49.860> is<00:01:50.130> the<00:01:50.549> most

00:01:50.719 --> 00:01:50.729 
importantly at this stage is the most

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.609 
importantly at this stage is the most
important<00:01:51.180> milestone<00:01:51.659> is<00:01:51.810> to<00:01:51.930> stabilize<00:01:52.140> it

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
important milestone is to stabilize it

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.130 
important milestone is to stabilize it
as<00:01:52.740> we've<00:01:53.310> talked<00:01:53.549> about<00:01:53.670> it's<00:01:54.659> our<00:01:54.899> works<00:01:55.079> not

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
as we've talked about it's our works not

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:57.020 
as we've talked about it's our works not
but<00:01:55.320> it's<00:01:55.710> like<00:01:56.189> a<00:01:56.219> hundred<00:01:56.460> percent<00:01:56.640> now

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
but it's like a hundred percent now

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.550 
but it's like a hundred percent now
right<00:01:57.329> so<00:01:57.630> i<00:01:57.659> think<00:01:57.869> that's<00:01:58.140> not<00:01:58.259> the<00:01:58.469> right

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
right so i think that's not the right

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.080 
right so i think that's not the right
way<00:01:58.740> to<00:01:58.799> look<00:01:58.950> at<00:01:59.130> it<00:01:59.189> i<00:01:59.280> think<00:01:59.460> the<00:01:59.549> right<00:01:59.939> way

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
way to look at it i think the right way

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.840 
way to look at it i think the right way
to<00:02:00.149> look<00:02:00.329> at<00:02:00.479> it<00:02:00.540> is<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:00.960> debt<00:02:01.200> that<00:02:02.189> is<00:02:02.250> held

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
to look at it is the debt that is held

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.660 
to look at it is the debt that is held
by<00:02:02.969> the<00:02:03.030> public<00:02:03.119> and<00:02:03.630> that<00:02:03.890> currently<00:02:04.890> in<00:02:05.250> two

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
by the public and that currently in two

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.340 
by the public and that currently in two
thousand<00:02:06.210> what's<00:02:06.479> the<00:02:06.630> case<00:02:06.810> of<00:02:06.990> let<00:02:07.170> why

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
thousand what's the case of let why

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.380 
thousand what's the case of let why
would<00:02:07.380> we<00:02:07.710> look<00:02:07.860> at<00:02:08.009> the<00:02:08.129> total<00:02:08.640> debt<00:02:08.849> why

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
would we look at the total debt why

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:10.880 
would we look at the total debt why
wouldn't<00:02:09.690> we<00:02:09.750> look<00:02:09.929> at<00:02:10.080> the<00:02:10.200> all<00:02:10.619> the

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:10.890 
wouldn't we look at the all the

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.290 
wouldn't we look at the all the
obligations<00:02:11.039> that<00:02:11.489> are<00:02:11.580> federally<00:02:11.970> look<00:02:12.120> at

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:12.300 
obligations that are federally look at

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.210 
obligations that are federally look at
that<00:02:13.200> that's<00:02:13.379> within<00:02:13.680> the<00:02:13.950> federal

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
that that's within the federal

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.070 
that that's within the federal
government<00:02:14.790> that's<00:02:15.150> sort<00:02:15.390> of<00:02:15.420> inside<00:02:15.900> the

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
government that's sort of inside the

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.260 
government that's sort of inside the
family<00:02:16.440> if<00:02:16.560> you<00:02:16.680> will<00:02:16.860> this<00:02:17.730> is<00:02:17.970> looking

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:18.270 
family if you will this is looking

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:20.000 
family if you will this is looking
outside<00:02:18.480> debt<00:02:19.020> held<00:02:19.230> by<00:02:19.290> the<00:02:19.379> public<00:02:19.500> i<00:02:19.830> think

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.010 
outside debt held by the public i think

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:21.350 
outside debt held by the public i think
is<00:02:20.099> the<00:02:20.129> right<00:02:20.340> metric<00:02:20.910> it's<00:02:21.090> what<00:02:21.239> most

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
is the right metric it's what most

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.059 
is the right metric it's what most
people<00:02:21.750> would<00:02:21.840> agree<00:02:21.959> is<00:02:22.260> the<00:02:22.410> right<00:02:22.590> metric

00:02:23.059 --> 00:02:23.069 
people would agree is the right metric

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:24.860 
people would agree is the right metric
and<00:02:23.220> so<00:02:23.310> you<00:02:23.370> think<00:02:23.670> it's<00:02:23.819> going<00:02:24.510> to<00:02:24.569> get<00:02:24.690> back

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870 
and so you think it's going to get back

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.369 
and so you think it's going to get back
to<00:02:24.989> you<00:02:25.050> on<00:02:25.080> the<00:02:25.620> percent<00:02:26.010> currently<00:02:26.489> in<00:02:27.379> 2012

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:28.379 
to you on the percent currently in 2012

00:02:28.379 --> 00:02:30.770 
to you on the percent currently in 2012
that's<00:02:28.590> about<00:02:28.830> seventy<00:02:29.370> four<00:02:29.610> percent<00:02:29.780> would

00:02:30.770 --> 00:02:30.780 
that's about seventy four percent would

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.690 
that's about seventy four percent would
i<00:02:30.810> be<00:02:31.019> inaccurate<00:02:31.349> i<00:02:31.650> say<00:02:31.860> look<00:02:32.250> it'll<00:02:32.400> debt

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
i be inaccurate i say look it'll debt

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.660 
i be inaccurate i say look it'll debt

president obama took office it was right

in the range of nine trillion dollars in

under this plan that's put forward by
the<00:02:45.239> president<00:02:45.750> would<00:02:45.900> go<00:02:46.019> to<00:02:46.080> 26<00:02:46.860> trillion

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
the president would go to 26 trillion

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:50.180 
the president would go to 26 trillion
dollars<00:02:47.750> it's<00:02:48.750> you<00:02:49.560> why<00:02:49.680> people<00:02:50.069> are

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:50.190 
dollars it's you why people are

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.009 
dollars it's you why people are
concerned<00:02:50.489> about<00:02:50.760> that<00:02:50.910> absolutely<00:02:51.480> and<00:02:51.900> i

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:52.019 
concerned about that absolutely and i

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:55.130 
concerned about that absolutely and i
would<00:02:52.200> say<00:02:52.440> a<00:02:52.680> major<00:02:53.430> root<00:02:54.120> cause<00:02:54.510> of<00:02:54.540> that

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:55.140 
would say a major root cause of that

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.160 
would say a major root cause of that
problem<00:02:55.530> is<00:02:55.950> the<00:02:56.640> fact<00:02:56.819> that<00:02:57.030> fire<00:02:57.840> in<00:02:58.080> the

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170 
problem is the fact that fire in the

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:00.020 
problem is the fact that fire in the
prior<00:02:58.379> administration<00:02:58.530> we<00:02:59.459> had<00:02:59.700> you're

explain to me at what point do we think
we<00:04:19.979> can<00:04:20.070> actually<00:04:20.370> justify<00:04:21.290> increasing<00:04:22.290> the

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:22.440 
we can actually justify increasing the

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.260 
we can actually justify increasing the
payroll<00:04:22.889> even<00:04:23.340> more<00:04:23.550> grown
