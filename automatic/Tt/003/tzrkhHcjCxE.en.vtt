00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:45.359 
health and armor make an enemy panic
stopping<00:01:42.340> health<00:01:42.520> regeneration<00:01:43.020> now<00:01:44.369> that's

stopping health regeneration now that's

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:49.679 
stopping health regeneration now that's
great<00:01:45.659> but<00:01:46.740> this<00:01:47.740> this<00:01:48.220> ability<00:01:48.729> is<00:01:49.060> a<00:01:49.149> direct

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:49.689 
great but this this ability is a direct

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:52.350 
great but this this ability is a direct
fire<00:01:50.130> ability<00:01:51.130> it<00:01:51.549> has<00:01:51.670> to<00:01:51.819> travel<00:01:52.060> to<00:01:52.240> the

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:52.360 
fire ability it has to travel to the

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.809 
fire ability it has to travel to the
target<00:01:52.569> means<00:01:53.020> if<00:01:53.799> they<00:01:53.979> jump<00:01:54.189> on<00:01:54.340> cover<00:01:54.640> or

00:01:54.809 --> 00:01:54.819 
target means if they jump on cover or

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:57.359 
target means if they jump on cover or
try<00:01:54.909> to<00:01:54.970> dodge<00:01:55.179> you're<00:01:55.600> gonna<00:01:55.720> miss<00:01:55.990> so<00:01:56.470> that's

00:01:57.359 --> 00:01:57.369 
try to dodge you're gonna miss so that's

00:01:57.369 --> 00:01:59.010 
try to dodge you're gonna miss so that's
why<00:01:57.460> I<00:01:57.490> only<00:01:57.579> put<00:01:57.850> three<00:01:58.000> points<00:01:58.270> into<00:01:58.509> it<00:01:58.630> I'm

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.020 
why I only put three points into it I'm

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.050 
why I only put three points into it I'm
not<00:01:59.170> level<00:01:59.409> 20<00:01:59.649> yet<00:01:59.799> so<00:02:00.039> you<00:02:00.100> guys<00:02:00.340> you<00:02:00.970> know

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
not level 20 yet so you guys you know

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:02.190 
not level 20 yet so you guys you know
you<00:02:01.090> can<00:02:01.329> put<00:02:01.479> more<00:02:01.569> points<00:02:01.840> of<00:02:01.929> that<00:02:02.049> later

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:02.200 
you can put more points of that later

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:04.710 
you can put more points of that later
it's<00:02:02.409> definitely<00:02:02.799> a<00:02:02.829> good<00:02:03.069> ability<00:02:03.490> but<00:02:04.270> to<00:02:04.569> do

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 
it's definitely a good ability but to do

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.559 
it's definitely a good ability but to do
damage<00:02:04.929> with<00:02:05.140> but<00:02:05.560> it's<00:02:06.240> not<00:02:07.240> that<00:02:07.420> great

00:02:07.559 --> 00:02:07.569
