stepping alright so when you monkey step
it's<00:00:23.400> a<00:00:23.460> pretty<00:00:23.609> simple<00:00:23.910> trick<00:00:28.429> while<00:00:29.429> you're

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580 
it's a pretty simple trick while you're

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:32.930 
it's a pretty simple trick while you're
moving<00:00:30.119> your<00:00:30.240> foot<00:00:30.480> moving<00:00:31.230> it<00:00:31.439> back<00:00:31.679> and<00:00:31.940> then

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
moving your foot moving it back and then

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.530 
moving your foot moving it back and then
keep<00:00:33.660> going<00:00:34.070> step<00:00:35.070> you<00:00:35.400> pivot<00:00:35.640> your<00:00:35.790> foot<00:00:36.090> step

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
keep going step you pivot your foot step

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.920 
keep going step you pivot your foot step
over<00:00:37.640> so<00:00:38.640> it's<00:00:38.790> like<00:00:38.910> a<00:00:38.940> continuous<00:00:39.600> pivot

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
over so it's like a continuous pivot

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:43.730 
over so it's like a continuous pivot
pivot<00:00:40.350> pivot<00:00:40.740> a<00:00:41.420> continuous<00:00:42.420> pivoting<00:00:42.840> said

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:43.740 
pivot pivot a continuous pivoting said

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:44.330 
pivot pivot a continuous pivoting said
that<00:00:43.890> correctly

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
that correctly

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.210 
that correctly
oh<00:00:44.810> my<00:00:45.810> point<00:00:46.140> in<00:00:46.380> the<00:00:46.560> center<00:00:46.830> of<00:00:46.920> the<00:00:46.980> board

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:47.220 
oh my point in the center of the board

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:49.880 
oh my point in the center of the board
while<00:00:48.030> your<00:00:48.240> other<00:00:48.270> foots<00:00:48.750> moving<00:00:48.960> around<00:00:49.530> and

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:49.890 
while your other foots moving around and

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:52.310 
while your other foots moving around and
your<00:00:49.980> body<00:00:50.160> follows<00:00:50.880> so<00:00:51.720> that's<00:00:51.900> the<00:00:52.170> monkey

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:52.320 
your body follows so that's the monkey

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.310 
your body follows so that's the monkey
step<00:00:52.710> and<00:00:53.690> if<00:00:54.690> you<00:00:54.780> do<00:00:54.900> it<00:00:55.020> while<00:00:55.200> you're

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
step and if you do it while you're

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:07.370 
step and if you do it while you're
carving<00:00:55.830> so<00:00:56.390> I'll<00:00:57.390> do<00:00:57.540> an<00:00:57.660> example<00:00:57.720> right<00:00:58.170> here

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:07.380 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.520 

the<00:01:08.380> next<00:01:08.650> damn<00:01:08.860> stiff<00:01:09.340> we<00:01:09.550> have<00:01:09.730> for<00:01:10.000> you<00:01:10.120> is

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
the next damn stiff we have for you is

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:21.060 
the next damn stiff we have for you is
cross<00:01:11.530> stepping<00:01:11.830> in

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:21.070 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:23.260 

the<00:01:22.070> hardest<00:01:22.370> part<00:01:22.520> about<00:01:22.580> this<00:01:22.910> trick<00:01:23.120> is

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.270 
the hardest part about this trick is

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.090 
the hardest part about this trick is
getting<00:01:23.540> used<00:01:23.750> to<00:01:23.930> carving<00:01:24.410> with<00:01:24.650> just<00:01:24.890> one

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:25.100 
getting used to carving with just one

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:33.850 
getting used to carving with just one
foot<00:01:25.400> on<00:01:25.640> the<00:01:25.820> end<00:01:25.940> of<00:01:26.060> your<00:01:26.180> board<00:01:32.860> they're

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 
foot on the end of your board they're

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:38.110 
foot on the end of your board they're
not<00:01:34.010> stable<00:01:36.160> but<00:01:37.160> that's<00:01:37.520> gonna<00:01:37.640> allow<00:01:37.820> you<00:01:37.970> to

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:38.120 
not stable but that's gonna allow you to

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:52.050 
not stable but that's gonna allow you to
turn<00:01:38.390> kind<00:01:39.020> of<00:01:39.110> have<00:01:39.290> your<00:01:39.500> one<00:01:39.680> foot<00:01:39.979> out<00:01:40.130> here

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:52.060 

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.120 

and<00:01:53.060> that's<00:01:53.930> pretty<00:01:54.080> much<00:01:54.200> the<00:01:54.320> basics<00:01:54.830> and

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:55.130 
and that's pretty much the basics and

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:57.910 
and that's pretty much the basics and
then<00:01:55.430> once<00:01:55.910> you<00:01:56.149> so<00:01:57.050> you're<00:01:57.259> turning<00:01:57.590> this<00:01:57.710> way

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:57.920 
then once you so you're turning this way

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.670 
then once you so you're turning this way
then<00:01:58.700> you<00:01:58.880> kind<00:01:59.420> of<00:01:59.479> just<00:01:59.570> do<00:02:00.140> this<00:02:00.320> off<00:02:00.530> your

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:00.680 
then you kind of just do this off your

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.010 
then you kind of just do this off your
board<00:02:00.890> and<00:02:01.610> once<00:02:01.790> here<00:02:01.970> once<00:02:02.570> you're<00:02:02.780> at<00:02:02.930> the

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:03.020 
board and once here once you're at the

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:12.580 
board and once here once you're at the
end<00:02:03.170> and<00:02:03.830> you<00:02:03.920> can<00:02:04.040> do<00:02:04.160> like<00:02:04.340> over<00:02:04.580> 180<00:02:11.590> well

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:12.590 
end and you can do like over 180 well

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:23.910 
end and you can do like over 180 well
you<00:02:12.800> got<00:02:12.920> the<00:02:13.070> one<00:02:13.220> foot<00:02:13.459> without<00:02:13.610> carving

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:23.920 

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:39.790 

you're<00:02:24.850> up<00:02:24.970> here
