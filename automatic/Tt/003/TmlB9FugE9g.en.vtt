00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:40.190 
the room for the adamant dragons there's
a<00:01:38.159> few<00:01:38.369> areas<00:01:38.610> this<00:01:39.119> is<00:01:39.329> the<00:01:39.509> main<00:01:39.720> one<00:01:39.750> here

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
a few areas this is the main one here

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.980 
a few areas this is the main one here
and<00:01:40.380> they<00:01:41.159> didn't<00:01:41.460> have<00:01:41.579> 32<00:01:42.119> k<00:01:42.329> a<00:01:42.360> life<00:01:42.600> points

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
and they didn't have 32 k a life points

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.139 
and they didn't have 32 k a life points
so<00:01:43.079> it<00:01:43.110> is<00:01:43.350> quite<00:01:43.590> high<00:01:43.770> as<00:01:44.430> well<00:01:44.670> as<00:01:44.790> that<00:01:44.909> in

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:45.149 
so it is quite high as well as that in

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:47.179 
so it is quite high as well as that in
both<00:01:45.420> locations<00:01:45.659> you<00:01:46.110> have<00:01:46.140> murals<00:01:46.829> which<00:01:47.070> you

00:02:20.509 --> 00:02:20.519 
remember i think is torment and then i'm

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:23.089 
remember i think is torment and then i'm
using<00:02:20.730> the<00:02:21.540> super<00:02:21.840> anti<00:02:22.139> fire<00:02:22.319> and<00:02:22.590> overloads

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:23.099 
using the super anti fire and overloads

00:02:23.099 --> 00:02:25.550 
using the super anti fire and overloads
they<00:02:23.700> will<00:02:23.999> sort<00:02:24.480> of<00:02:24.569> speed<00:02:24.870> up<00:02:24.989> the<00:02:25.109> kilowatt

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:25.560 
they will sort of speed up the kilowatt

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.649 
they will sort of speed up the kilowatt
and<00:02:25.769> it's<00:02:26.400> definitely<00:02:26.670> advised<00:02:27.030> to<00:02:27.239> use<00:02:27.329> super

00:02:27.649 --> 00:02:27.659 
and it's definitely advised to use super

00:02:27.659 --> 00:02:29.899 
and it's definitely advised to use super
any<00:02:27.930> fire<00:02:28.109> rather<00:02:28.680> than<00:02:29.010> the<00:02:29.340> dragon<00:02:29.760> fire

00:02:29.899 --> 00:02:29.909 
any fire rather than the dragon fire

00:02:29.909 --> 00:02:32.839 
any fire rather than the dragon fire
shield<00:02:30.180> it's<00:02:30.900> a<00:02:30.989> lot<00:02:31.109> easier<00:02:31.519> so<00:02:32.519> yeah<00:02:32.700> i<00:02:32.730> do

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:32.849 
shield it's a lot easier so yeah i do

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:35.300 
shield it's a lot easier so yeah i do
recommend<00:02:33.150> that<00:02:33.599> as<00:02:34.349> well<00:02:34.620> as<00:02:34.709> that<00:02:34.889> for<00:02:35.189> the

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310

in this ruined dragon attack and this is

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:17.430 
in this ruined dragon attack and this is
what<00:05:15.160> happens<00:05:15.490> if<00:05:15.700> you're<00:05:16.480> like<00:05:16.720> LLL<00:05:17.020> jump<00:05:17.260> up

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:17.440 
what happens if you're like LLL jump up

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:19.500 
what happens if you're like LLL jump up
in<00:05:17.560> the<00:05:17.590> air<00:05:17.680> and<00:05:18.010> your<00:05:18.490> V<00:05:18.700> sort<00:05:19.120> of<00:05:19.180> attacked

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:19.510 
in the air and your V sort of attacked

00:05:19.510 --> 00:05:21.300 
in the air and your V sort of attacked
by<00:05:19.750> the<00:05:19.810> dragon<00:05:20.260> was<00:05:20.500> it's<00:05:20.680> in<00:05:20.800> the<00:05:20.950> air<00:05:21.070> and

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:21.310 
by the dragon was it's in the air and

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:24.930 
by the dragon was it's in the air and
then<00:05:21.940> there's<00:05:22.270> a<00:05:22.480> enrage<00:05:23.350> phase<00:05:24.040> which<00:05:24.700> will

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:24.940 
then there's a enrage phase which will

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:27.630 
then there's a enrage phase which will
increase<00:05:25.360> their<00:05:25.690> maximum<00:05:26.110> damage<00:05:26.350> and<00:05:26.710> with

increase their maximum damage and with
each<00:05:27.820> attack<00:05:28.180> so<00:05:28.690> they<00:05:29.200> are<00:05:29.410> pretty<00:05:29.680> difficult

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:30.070 
each attack so they are pretty difficult

00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:33.120 
each attack so they are pretty difficult

the level 90 power boot in all three

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:11.130 
the level 90 power boot in all three
styles<00:06:08.650> and<00:06:08.860> and<00:06:09.729> these<00:06:10.060> items<00:06:10.390> are<00:06:10.780> dropped

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:11.140
