00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.489 
much more rare but women can yeah yeah
it's<00:01:48.479> really<00:01:48.689> rare<00:01:48.840> but<00:01:48.990> in<00:01:49.109> terms<00:01:49.319> of<00:01:49.439> the

00:01:49.489 --> 00:01:49.499 
it's really rare but in terms of the

00:01:49.499 --> 00:01:51.020 
it's really rare but in terms of the
prevalence<00:01:49.889> it<00:01:49.979> is<00:01:50.069> definitely<00:01:50.490> increasing

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030 
prevalence it is definitely increasing

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.639 
prevalence it is definitely increasing
but<00:01:51.719> it's<00:01:51.840> difficult<00:01:52.139> to<00:01:52.200> know<00:01:52.229> exactly<00:01:52.590> how

00:01:52.639 --> 00:01:52.649 
but it's difficult to know exactly how

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:54.109 
but it's difficult to know exactly how
common<00:01:53.130> it<00:01:53.249> is<00:01:53.369> because<00:01:53.789> we<00:01:53.880> don't<00:01:53.999> really

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
common it is because we don't really

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.719 
common it is because we don't really
know<00:01:54.270> exactly<00:01:54.990> what<00:01:55.530> it<00:01:55.649> is<00:01:55.740> exactly<00:01:55.979> but<00:01:56.310> I

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
know exactly what it is exactly but I

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:58.699 
know exactly what it is exactly but I
think<00:01:57.119> sort<00:01:57.569> of<00:01:57.659> conservative<00:01:58.229> estimates

00:01:58.699 --> 00:01:58.709 
think sort of conservative estimates

00:01:58.709 --> 00:01:59.840 
think sort of conservative estimates
would<00:01:58.799> be<00:01:58.920> between<00:01:59.159> sort<00:01:59.369> of<00:01:59.399> point<00:01:59.609> three<00:01:59.789> and

00:01:59.840 --> 00:01:59.850 
would be between sort of point three and

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.730 
would be between sort of point three and
point<00:01:59.939> five<00:02:00.209> percent<00:02:00.420> of<00:02:00.810> the<00:02:00.929> population<00:02:01.560> but

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
point five percent of the population but

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.499 
point five percent of the population but
I<00:02:01.979> think<00:02:02.520> crucially<00:02:02.880> the<00:02:02.999> number<00:02:03.240> of<00:02:03.329> those

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509 
I think crucially the number of those

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.660 
I think crucially the number of those
afflicted<00:02:04.079> by<00:02:04.469> some<00:02:04.829> symptoms<00:02:05.219> but<00:02:05.369> not<00:02:05.429> all

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
afflicted by some symptoms but not all

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.190 
afflicted by some symptoms but not all
of<00:02:05.700> them<00:02:05.999> so<00:02:06.450> they<00:02:06.569> do<00:02:06.630> have<00:02:06.719> their<00:02:07.049> lives

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:07.200 
of them so they do have their lives

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.440 
of them so they do have their lives
impacted<00:02:07.529> is<00:02:08.000> substantially<00:02:09.000> bigger<00:02:09.209> and

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
impacted is substantially bigger and

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:10.699 
impacted is substantially bigger and
could<00:02:09.600> be<00:02:09.690> sort<00:02:09.869> of<00:02:09.929> upwards<00:02:10.380> of<00:02:10.470> half<00:02:10.560> a

00:02:10.699 --> 00:02:10.709 
could be sort of upwards of half a

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.100 
could be sort of upwards of half a
million<00:02:10.890> people<00:02:11.250> I<00:02:11.340> think<00:02:11.400> Wow<00:02:11.909> yeah<00:02:12.299> so<00:02:12.900> what

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:13.110 
million people I think Wow yeah so what

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:14.240 
million people I think Wow yeah so what
is<00:02:13.260> the<00:02:13.439> line

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
is the line

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.360 
is the line
between<00:02:15.060> being<00:02:15.600> healthy<00:02:16.170> and<00:02:16.410> wanting<00:02:17.340> to

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:17.370 
between being healthy and wanting to

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.450 
between being healthy and wanting to
exercise<00:02:17.970> regularly<00:02:18.540> for<00:02:19.260> it<00:02:19.410> and<00:02:19.980> and

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:20.460 
exercise regularly for it and and

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.640 
exercise regularly for it and and
becoming<00:02:21.030> an<00:02:21.150> obsession<00:02:21.650> million-dollar

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:22.650 
becoming an obsession million-dollar

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:25.370 
becoming an obsession million-dollar
question<00:02:22.830> I<00:02:23.130> think<00:02:23.630> with<00:02:24.630> the<00:02:25.050> lines

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
question I think with the lines

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.020 
question I think with the lines
generally<00:02:25.770> learn<00:02:26.130> along<00:02:26.400> the<00:02:26.520> grounds<00:02:26.820> of<00:02:26.880> the

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
generally learn along the grounds of the

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.580 
generally learn along the grounds of the
amount<00:02:27.270> of<00:02:27.330> impairment<00:02:27.660> and<00:02:27.990> distress<00:02:28.320> caused

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:28.590 
amount of impairment and distress caused

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.980 
amount of impairment and distress caused
to<00:02:28.800> the<00:02:28.890> individual<00:02:29.370> so<00:02:29.580> I<00:02:29.790> think<00:02:30.570> going<00:02:30.900> to

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:30.990 
to the individual so I think going to

00:02:30.990 --> 00:02:32.570 
to the individual so I think going to
the<00:02:31.080> gym<00:02:31.170> was<00:02:31.410> ultimately<00:02:31.740> a<00:02:31.800> health<00:02:31.980> healthy

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:32.580 
the gym was ultimately a health healthy

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.480 
the gym was ultimately a health healthy
pursuit<00:02:33.500> if<00:02:34.500> there's<00:02:34.770> a<00:02:34.830> significant<00:02:35.459> amount

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 
pursuit if there's a significant amount

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:36.949 
pursuit if there's a significant amount
of<00:02:35.670> distress<00:02:36.060> and<00:02:36.240> sort<00:02:36.420> of<00:02:36.450> impairment<00:02:36.690> to

00:02:36.949 --> 00:02:36.959 
of distress and sort of impairment to

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:38.810 
of distress and sort of impairment to
normal<00:02:37.230> functioning<00:02:37.740> and<00:02:38.220> examples<00:02:38.700> I<00:02:38.760> can

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:38.820 
normal functioning and examples I can

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:40.310 
normal functioning and examples I can
think<00:02:39.030> of<00:02:39.180> of<00:02:39.270> where<00:02:39.450> people<00:02:39.600> sort<00:02:39.990> of<00:02:40.050> quit

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:40.320 
think of of where people sort of quit

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:41.930 
think of of where people sort of quit
their<00:02:40.470> jobs<00:02:40.740> as<00:02:40.980> professional<00:02:41.520> jobs<00:02:41.730> so<00:02:41.850> they

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:41.940 
their jobs as professional jobs so they

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:44.420 
their jobs as professional jobs so they
can<00:02:41.970> work<00:02:42.240> out<00:02:42.450> and<00:02:43.200> sort<00:02:43.440> of<00:02:43.500> set<00:02:44.220> their<00:02:44.400> alarm

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:44.430 
can work out and sort of set their alarm

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:45.830 
can work out and sort of set their alarm
in<00:02:44.820> the<00:02:44.880> middle<00:02:45.150> of<00:02:45.209> the<00:02:45.270> night<00:02:45.420> so<00:02:45.570> they<00:02:45.690> can

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:45.840 
in the middle of the night so they can

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.060 
in the middle of the night so they can
wake<00:02:45.959> up<00:02:46.080> and<00:02:46.170> have<00:02:46.290> protein<00:02:46.680> shakes<00:02:46.920> and

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 
wake up and have protein shakes and

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:48.410 
wake up and have protein shakes and
things<00:02:47.250> like<00:02:47.340> that<00:02:47.400> that's<00:02:47.610> good<00:02:47.880> distressing

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:48.420 
things like that that's good distressing

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:49.820 
things like that that's good distressing
for<00:02:48.510> that<00:02:48.630> person<00:02:48.959> so<00:02:49.080> we'd<00:02:49.200> say<00:02:49.320> that's<00:02:49.530> more

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
for that person so we'd say that's more

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.880 
for that person so we'd say that's more
sort<00:02:50.160> of<00:02:50.220> towards<00:02:51.120> the<00:02:51.180> extreme<00:02:51.480> end<00:02:51.750> okay<00:02:52.500> can

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
sort of towards the extreme end okay can

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.320 
sort of towards the extreme end okay can
it<00:02:52.980> be<00:02:53.100> dangerous<00:02:53.550> I<00:02:53.670> mean<00:02:53.820> we<00:02:53.910> spend<00:02:54.120> a<00:02:54.150> lot<00:02:54.300> of

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:54.330 
it be dangerous I mean we spend a lot of

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.479 
it be dangerous I mean we spend a lot of
time<00:02:54.540> talking<00:02:54.630> about<00:02:54.840> obesity<00:02:55.200> problems<00:02:55.800> hmm

00:02:56.479 --> 00:02:56.489 
time talking about obesity problems hmm

00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:58.280 
time talking about obesity problems hmm
so<00:02:56.610> can<00:02:56.820> over<00:02:57.090> exercising<00:02:57.810> and<00:02:57.930> building<00:02:58.200> up

00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:58.290 
so can over exercising and building up

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:59.840 
so can over exercising and building up
too<00:02:58.440> many<00:02:58.590> muscles<00:02:58.770> be<00:02:59.070> dangerous

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
too many muscles be dangerous

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:01.250 
too many muscles be dangerous
I<00:02:59.880> think<00:03:00.570> this<00:03:00.660> decide<00:03:00.930> it<00:03:01.020> can't<00:03:01.170> be

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
I think this decide it can't be

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:02.330 
I think this decide it can't be
dangerous<00:03:01.380> in<00:03:01.620> terms<00:03:01.650> of<00:03:01.920> quality<00:03:02.220> of<00:03:02.250> life

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:02.340 
dangerous in terms of quality of life

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:05.000 
dangerous in terms of quality of life
certainly<00:03:02.970> some<00:03:03.620> people<00:03:04.620> are<00:03:04.709> fit<00:03:04.860> not

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
certainly some people are fit not

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.920 
certainly some people are fit not
physically<00:03:05.550> so<00:03:05.790> if<00:03:05.880> it's<00:03:06.030> impacting<00:03:06.720> on<00:03:06.810> their

00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:06.930 
physically so if it's impacting on their

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:08.449 
physically so if it's impacting on their
life<00:03:07.050> that's<00:03:07.290> something<00:03:07.590> they<00:03:07.709> can<00:03:07.950> live<00:03:08.430> with

00:03:08.449 --> 00:03:08.459 
life that's something they can live with

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:10.550 
life that's something they can live with
but<00:03:09.030> it's<00:03:09.209> not<00:03:09.300> physically<00:03:10.200> harmful

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:10.560 
but it's not physically harmful

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.740 
but it's not physically harmful
physically<00:03:11.340> I<00:03:11.400> think<00:03:11.459> it<00:03:11.760> kind<00:03:12.000> of<00:03:12.120> that's<00:03:12.630> the

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:12.750 
physically I think it kind of that's the

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.150 
physically I think it kind of that's the
GEMA<00:03:12.959> must<00:03:13.200> know<00:03:13.320> more<00:03:13.440> about<00:03:13.500> it<00:03:13.709> as<00:03:13.800> well<00:03:13.920> and

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:14.160 
GEMA must know more about it as well and

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.340 
GEMA must know more about it as well and
these<00:03:14.489> guys<00:03:14.820> they<00:03:15.030> look<00:03:15.209> after<00:03:15.840> very<00:03:16.050> healthy

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:16.350 
these guys they look after very healthy

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:17.630 
these guys they look after very healthy
but<00:03:16.500> there<00:03:16.620> can<00:03:16.770> be<00:03:16.890> sort<00:03:17.070> of<00:03:17.100> nutritionally

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
but there can be sort of nutritionally

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:19.100 
but there can be sort of nutritionally
deficient<00:03:17.790> as<00:03:18.239> well<00:03:18.390> at<00:03:18.480> least<00:03:18.600> guys<00:03:18.840> sort<00:03:19.049> of

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110 
deficient as well at least guys sort of

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:20.750 
deficient as well at least guys sort of
gear<00:03:19.380> that<00:03:19.410> their<00:03:19.830> food<00:03:20.040> intake<00:03:20.280> just<00:03:20.549> around

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
gear that their food intake just around

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.580 
gear that their food intake just around
protein<00:03:21.209> so<00:03:21.870> they<00:03:22.019> can<00:03:22.170> become<00:03:22.290> quite

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:22.590 
protein so they can become quite

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:24.710 
protein so they can become quite
deficient<00:03:23.459> in<00:03:23.519> sort<00:03:24.000> of<00:03:24.060> the<00:03:24.120> necessary<00:03:24.480> fats

deficient in sort of the necessary fats

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:26.600 
deficient in sort of the necessary fats
and<00:03:24.870> carbohydrates<00:03:25.130> and<00:03:26.130> also<00:03:26.400> there's<00:03:26.549> a

and carbohydrates and also there's a

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:27.860

massive health risk with steroid abuse

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:29.810 
massive health risk with steroid abuse
which<00:03:28.799> is<00:03:28.920> the<00:03:29.010> general<00:03:29.280> feature<00:03:29.549> of<00:03:29.700> this

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:29.820 
which is the general feature of this

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:32.240 
which is the general feature of this
disorder<00:03:30.120> as<00:03:30.299> well<00:03:30.510> yeah<00:03:31.230> well<00:03:31.739> when<00:03:32.130> you

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:32.250 
disorder as well yeah well when you

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:33.710 
disorder as well yeah well when you
start<00:03:32.519> popping<00:03:32.700> pills<00:03:33.060> that's<00:03:33.330> certainly

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:33.720 
start popping pills that's certainly

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.360 
start popping pills that's certainly
going<00:03:33.930> over<00:03:34.260> the<00:03:34.350> line<00:03:34.530> is<00:03:34.739> that<00:03:34.890> yeah<00:03:35.190> what

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:35.370 
going over the line is that yeah what

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:37.580 
going over the line is that yeah what
are<00:03:35.459> some<00:03:35.640> of<00:03:35.760> the<00:03:35.850> extremes<00:03:36.299> you're<00:03:37.230> telling

00:03:37.580 --> 00:03:37.590 
are some of the extremes you're telling

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:39.530 
are some of the extremes you're telling
us<00:03:37.620> people<00:03:37.890> were<00:03:38.220> wake<00:03:38.760> up<00:03:38.940> in<00:03:39.090> the<00:03:39.150> middle<00:03:39.269> of

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:39.540 
us people were wake up in the middle of

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.620 
us people were wake up in the middle of
the<00:03:39.660> night<00:03:39.810> for<00:03:40.019> protein<00:03:40.500> shakes<00:03:41.150> what<00:03:42.150> other

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:42.630 
the night for protein shakes what other

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:43.970 
the night for protein shakes what other
things<00:03:42.930> have<00:03:42.989> you<00:03:43.079> said<00:03:43.350> it<00:03:43.560> can<00:03:43.769> get<00:03:43.860> pretty

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:43.980 
things have you said it can get pretty

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.270 
things have you said it can get pretty
extreme<00:03:44.430> minutes<00:03:44.790> when<00:03:45.090> it's<00:03:45.239> full-on<00:03:45.560> I<00:03:46.560> have

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:47.280 
extreme minutes when it's full-on I have

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:48.590 
extreme minutes when it's full-on I have
seen<00:03:47.489> cases<00:03:47.610> where<00:03:47.880> people<00:03:48.030> sort<00:03:48.420> of<00:03:48.450> have

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:48.600 
seen cases where people sort of have

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:49.970 
seen cases where people sort of have
injuries<00:03:48.989> and<00:03:49.170> they<00:03:49.230> refuse<00:03:49.680> to<00:03:49.799> stop

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:49.980 
injuries and they refuse to stop

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.039 
injuries and they refuse to stop
training<00:03:50.280> so<00:03:51.000> if<00:03:51.060> you<00:03:51.180> have<00:03:51.329> CP<00:03:51.570> shame<00:03:51.900> with

00:03:52.039 --> 00:03:52.049 
training so if you have CP shame with

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:53.539 
training so if you have CP shame with
smoke<00:03:52.260> alarms<00:03:52.709> because<00:03:52.829> they're<00:03:53.070> so<00:03:53.250> sort<00:03:53.519> of

00:03:53.539 --> 00:03:53.549 
smoke alarms because they're so sort of

00:03:53.549 --> 00:03:54.949 
smoke alarms because they're so sort of
anxious<00:03:53.730> about<00:03:53.910> not<00:03:54.209> turning<00:03:54.390> and<00:03:54.630> losing

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 
anxious about not turning and losing

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:57.170 
anxious about not turning and losing
size<00:03:55.170> that<00:03:56.040> would<00:03:56.310> train<00:03:56.549> and<00:03:56.850> lift<00:03:57.000> heavy

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
size that would train and lift heavy

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:58.250 
size that would train and lift heavy
weights<00:03:57.420> with<00:03:57.570> broken<00:03:57.870> arm<00:03:58.019> so<00:03:58.110> their

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:58.260 
weights with broken arm so their

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.830 
weights with broken arm so their
injuries<00:03:58.590> get<00:03:58.829> a<00:03:59.010> lot<00:03:59.730> worse<00:03:59.910> and<00:04:00.150> I<00:04:00.209> think<00:04:00.420> one

00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:00.840 
injuries get a lot worse and I think one

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.210 
injuries get a lot worse and I think one
of<00:04:00.870> the<00:04:01.049> most<00:04:01.170> extreme<00:04:01.560> foods<00:04:01.739> as<00:04:01.860> you<00:04:01.980> can<00:04:02.100> see

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:02.220 
of the most extreme foods as you can see

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:03.650 
of the most extreme foods as you can see
on<00:04:02.310> the<00:04:02.370> screen<00:04:02.489> here<00:04:02.820> is<00:04:02.940> is<00:04:03.120> what<00:04:03.390> they<00:04:03.510> call

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:03.660 
on the screen here is is what they call

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.210

do you do I think at the gym quite often
these<00:04:39.810> these<00:04:40.020> behaviors<00:04:40.650> kind<00:04:40.920> of<00:04:41.010> reinforced

these these behaviors kind of reinforced

00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:43.010 
these these behaviors kind of reinforced
and<00:04:41.760> sort<00:04:42.000> of<00:04:42.030> normalize<00:04:42.480> because<00:04:42.690> they're

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:43.020
