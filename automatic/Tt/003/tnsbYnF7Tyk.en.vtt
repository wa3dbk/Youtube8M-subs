00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.309 

I've<00:00:00.329> been<00:00:00.450> getting<00:00:00.659> a<00:00:00.719> lot<00:00:00.750> of<00:00:00.900> questions

00:00:01.309 --> 00:00:01.319 
I've been getting a lot of questions

00:00:01.319 --> 00:00:04.130 
I've been getting a lot of questions
about<00:00:01.469> the<00:00:01.800> switch<00:00:02.340> this<00:00:03.300> is<00:00:03.480> a<00:00:03.510> switch<00:00:03.959> you

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:04.140 
about the switch this is a switch you

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:07.690 
about the switch this is a switch you
can<00:00:04.230> get<00:00:04.380> from<00:00:04.529> Lowe's<00:00:05.000> for<00:00:06.000> like<00:00:06.180> four<00:00:06.899> bucks

00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:07.700 
can get from Lowe's for like four bucks

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:11.799 
can get from Lowe's for like four bucks
32:52<00:00:08.700> or<00:00:08.970> something<00:00:09.240> like<00:00:09.330> that<00:00:10.219> all<00:00:11.219> right

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:11.809 
32:52 or something like that all right

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:15.230 
32:52 or something like that all right
basically<00:00:13.490> you<00:00:14.490> know<00:00:14.610> you<00:00:14.670> got<00:00:14.849> your<00:00:15.000> switch

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:15.240 
basically you know you got your switch

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.170 
basically you know you got your switch
right<00:00:15.450> there<00:00:15.480> in<00:00:16.379> the<00:00:16.500> two<00:00:16.680> input<00:00:17.220> lines<00:00:17.460> and

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
right there in the two input lines and

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.040 
right there in the two input lines and
put<00:00:18.420> an<00:00:18.510> output<00:00:18.810> line<00:00:19.550> then<00:00:20.550> you<00:00:20.640> have<00:00:21.050> your

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
put an output line then you have your

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:31.880 
put an output line then you have your
whole<00:00:25.160> show<00:00:26.160> you<00:00:26.220> mono<00:00:30.289> just<00:00:31.289> ties<00:00:31.500> into<00:00:31.769> your

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
whole show you mono just ties into your

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.750 
whole show you mono just ties into your
remote<00:00:32.189> wire

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:37.760 

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:39.980 

so<00:00:38.180> basically

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:39.990 
so basically

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:42.730 
so basically
besides<00:00:40.710> positive

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:42.740 
besides positive

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:46.710 
besides positive
and<00:00:42.860> this<00:00:43.340> side<00:00:43.640> is<00:00:43.880> positive

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:46.720 

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.190 

basically<00:00:47.440> you<00:00:47.739> know<00:00:47.860> put<00:00:48.460> the<00:00:48.550> two<00:00:48.730> together

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200 
basically you know put the two together

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.520 
basically you know put the two together
finish<00:00:50.200> the<00:00:50.350> current

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:53.530 

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:55.049 

you<00:00:53.860> just<00:00:54.070> drill<00:00:54.219> a<00:00:54.250> hole<00:00:54.460> for<00:00:54.640> your<00:00:54.699> panel

00:00:55.049 --> 00:00:55.059 
you just drill a hole for your panel

00:00:55.059 --> 00:00:56.639 
you just drill a hole for your panel
I'll<00:00:55.300> use<00:00:55.510> the<00:00:55.719> panel<00:00:55.989> because<00:00:56.260> it's<00:00:56.410> a<00:00:56.440> little

00:00:56.639 --> 00:00:56.649 
I'll use the panel because it's a little

00:00:56.649 --> 00:00:58.200 
I'll use the panel because it's a little
bit<00:00:56.739> more<00:00:56.949> convenient<00:00:57.309> for<00:00:57.579> me<00:00:57.699> and<00:00:57.879> less

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:58.210 
bit more convenient for me and less

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.810 
bit more convenient for me and less
noticeable<00:00:58.769> instead<00:00:59.769> of<00:00:59.920> up<00:01:00.100> here<00:01:00.129> somewhere

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:00.820 
noticeable instead of up here somewhere

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:03.810 
noticeable instead of up here somewhere
on<00:01:01.360> the<00:01:01.540> dash<00:01:02.190> always<00:01:03.190> think<00:01:03.399> about<00:01:03.489> putting

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:03.820 
on the dash always think about putting

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:05.789 
on the dash always think about putting
it<00:01:03.910> right<00:01:03.940> here<00:01:04.059> but<00:01:04.509> I<00:01:04.690> rest<00:01:05.019> my<00:01:05.290> knee<00:01:05.350> there<00:01:05.740> a

00:01:05.789 --> 00:01:05.799 
it right here but I rest my knee there a

00:01:05.799 --> 00:01:10.770 
it right here but I rest my knee there a
lot<00:01:06.040> when<00:01:06.250> I<00:01:06.280> Drive<00:01:07.440> for<00:01:08.440> them<00:01:09.240> it's<00:01:10.240> really

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:10.780 
lot when I Drive for them it's really

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.980 
lot when I Drive for them it's really
convenient<00:01:11.200> right<00:01:11.590> there<00:01:11.800> for<00:01:12.009> me<00:01:12.420> and<00:01:13.420> they

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:47.750 
oh yeah like I said here at Lowe's 392

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:59.820 
oh yeah like I said here at Lowe's 392
our<00:04:48.650> 352<00:04:49.340> switch<00:04:53.410> right<00:04:54.410> to<00:04:54.620> your<00:04:54.740> remote<00:04:54.950> wire

00:04:59.820 --> 00:04:59.830 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:03.790
