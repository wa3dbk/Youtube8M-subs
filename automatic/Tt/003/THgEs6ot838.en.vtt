00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:08.120
 hand up dale down 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:09.440
 put it aside on the other side of that 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:11.389
 is true because if today we were 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:12.049
 talking to our dear michelle 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:13.940
 obama 

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:15.440
 we have to definitely follow that 

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:17.840
 legacy that she is implanting not 

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.519
 only in the us but in the world 

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:21.230
 Eat healthy and live a better life 

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:22.910
 not only for us but for 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:25.310
 our children because because it is the 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:27.320
 future you definitely already know that she 

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:29.929
 created this great organization where 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:33.230
 We dedicate to give better foods to 

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:35.450
 our children my plate and let's move two 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.280
 organizations that are dedicated justly 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:39.320
 to them through the schools 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.610
 educating that I think is the key to 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.890
 all this today we are going to prepare one of 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:45.649
 their recipes and are some meatballs 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.440
 turkey one of the recipes approved by his 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:49.670
 menu and they are definitely 

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:51.289
 incredibly delicious they have to 

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.210
 try not only for children to 

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:56.000
 we will show you at home 

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:59.210
 graphic of what she spoke to us arrives 

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.739
 of being the food pyramid that 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:02.719
 we were always used to what 

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:04.340
 is today they will see it justly 

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:06.020
 now in a little while and let's start 

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:08.090
 with the preparation 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.789
 let's start with a basic glaze 

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:14.000
 that will go over our 

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:15.409
 meatballs adding a little there 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.719
 they are seeing right now what is 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:21.530
 the graph of how we should more 

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:23.719
 that a pyramid we must create our 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.310
 dish or that's how it should be formed 

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:26.539
 our vegetable fruits dish our 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:29.420
 proteins our carbohydrates 

00:01:26.539 --> 00:01:31.939
 we add our for our grace a 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:34.819
 little chicken broth and then add it 

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:35.869
 a little bit in this case of pasta 

00:01:34.819 --> 00:01:37.729
 tomato to give us consistency 

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:40.640
 let's swing it with a little honey 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:42.439
 and honey is going to be our glaze that 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.319
 you see over the meatballs very 

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:46.369
 very very rich I tried the recipe 

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:47.689
 previously and you are going to see how 

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:49.729
 it's going to be that the most important thing then 

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:53.149
 We are going to accompany you with a service 

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:56.270
 vegetable a way of how I even 

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:58.069
 I started to change the pasta from my diet 

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:59.599
 just look closely what I have 

00:01:58.069 --> 00:02:00.979
 here a little garlic that we are going to 

00:01:59.599 --> 00:02:03.409
 add in a pan with olive oil 

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:05.840
 and then I have a little zucchini what 

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:07.399
 what I did to chop it finely and that 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.250
 way we can change it for a 

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:11.690
 pasta without any inconvenience 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:12.410
 maintaining that form that of course 

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:14.090
 we love 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.400
 to skip to start talking 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.280
 a little there with the chili pepper is delicious 

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:21.020
 now let's jump to what is going to be 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.760
 our meatballs I will add turkey 

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.380
 I am adding two types of turkey 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:26.000
 white meat and dark meat because 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:28.310
 because how salt is going to help this 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.950
 much with the textures then we're going to 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:33.110
 add a little mustard let's 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.700
 add chili powder a little touch 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.680
 lemon juice of course to give 

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:40.460
 acidity then we skip a little bit of 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:44.080
 salt pepper let's add some 

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:46.070
 peas a little bit of red paprika 

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.020
 broccoli here are the services 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:49.400
 very important vegetables we are going to 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:51.320
 add a touch of onion to 

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.460
 flavor it and then a bit of cheese 

00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:54.440
 Parmesan 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:57.410
 to finish look nothing else what 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:03:00.440
 amount of flavor we are going to add a bread 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:02.060
 whole soaked in a little milk and 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:03.340
 then what we do is put the 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:06.200
 Do not be afraid, let's mix 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.820
 We incorporate all the ingredients 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.370
 best tool of a cook 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:12.140
 they are definitely the gentlemen hands 

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.870
 so do not be afraid add 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:17.209
 we mix we mix we mix and we go to 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:18.830
 add the pea can you 

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:20.930
 add a little bit of olive oil 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:23.270
 English sauce to give it a little touch 

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:26.690
 more of flavor and once we have this 

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:28.940
 ready mix we prepare some balls of 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:30.710
 size that you want to do it and here 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:32.450
 is where I say can you integrate your child 

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:33.950
 At home we will take it to the oven where 

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:36.800
 I already have some ready I'm going to 

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:38.870
 show how spectacular it looks 

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:40.760
 you just frosted 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:42.310
 above and you will have some 

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:45.200
 meatballs how is it totally 

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:47.600
 golden with that sauce glaze 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:50.510
 tomato that we prepare very simple 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:53.360
 delicious and at the same time healthy 

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:55.190
 which is the most important thing we have all 

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:57.320
 the plant protein services and what 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:59.420
 serve with a plate of fruit that 

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:01.900
 they go to the mountain I do not know about you but 

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:04.000
 you notice 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.379
 and what a treat we're leaving quickly 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.150
 pause I want to eat meatballs 

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:09.150
