00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.219
 after two victorious games should play now 

00:00:07.149 --> 00:00:10.059
 the third three in a row for the 

00:00:09.219 --> 00:00:12.549
 ssv ulm 

00:00:10.059 --> 00:00:14.590
 but also the enemy fc germania 

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:16.570
 friedrichstal was very good in the new 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:18.360
 season started and wanted this 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:20.520
 prevent as much as possible 

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:22.440
 now pressure started flanking from the left 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.740
 side but it is missing at the beginning of the game 

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:26.760
 something else in the necessary precision 

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.260
 free kick for the sparrows of the balcony 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.119
 perfect inside but that 

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.810
 subsequent header long with only on 

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:33.180
 outside network 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.950
 Ulm continues to progress well 

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.390
 conclusion from there how broad yet 

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.140
 Friedrich partly keeper can in the last 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.200
 clarify moment 

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.360
 and we continue relentlessly 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.680
 are just before the break for barack obama 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.020
 is the chance to shoot? 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:48.420
 Freiberg will be at the last moment from 

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:50.250
 war explained in the second half 

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.690
 then comes the first end 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:53.190
 possibility for peace 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.260
 the guests come over the right side 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.710
 but ssv keeper holger betz is to 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.560
 location 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.420
 it follows the subsequent corner of the 

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:02.910
 ball comes regulated in the sixteenth 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.190
 and from behind köpf bogdan alexander call 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.820
 the disco ball powerful in the 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:08.250
 mesh 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.910
 this is the 1 0 guide for the guests in 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.910
 the 58th 

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.490
 ulm did not let the sparrows come 

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.170
 over the left side the ball becomes 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.240
 initially clarified in the back room 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.310
 but tobacco ball ready to shoot yet 

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.180
 his attempt will be on at the last moment 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.159
 the line clarified 

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.840
 then a ball comes from the right 

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:28.909
 side and in the middle gets one 

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.420
 the friedrichsthaler player plays the ball 

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:30.979
 the hand 

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:33.350
 the referee decides rightly 

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:36.679
 on offense shock there too help everyone 

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:38.420
 protests max bachl-staudinger takes over 

00:01:36.679 --> 00:01:39.049
 the responsibility and transforms 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.579
 sovereign 

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:44.860
 that is the deserved compensation for the 

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:44.860
 ssv might have more in it now 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:53.259
 again in the offensive of 

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:55.420
 friedrichsthal the tree gardener goes along 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:56.649
 his legs are high opposite ryan den 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.360
 but referee remains nothing 

00:01:56.649 --> 00:01:58.810
 other than the yellow card too 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.850
 numbers 

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.340
 For baumgärtner this is the second and 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.060
 consequently , he must logically red with yellow 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:05.890
 from the place 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.299
 the ulmer now convinced in further 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.099
 einwurf around the right side 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:09.550
 extended and friedrichstal can not 

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:12.099
 clarify 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.510
 peruzzo shot attempt arrived cds kaya 

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:14.440
 but his shot is at the last moment 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.200
 blocked 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.550
 just seconds later left over 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.260
 there comes the beautiful flank in the 

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:22.480
 Sixteen and the ball is in it 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:24.819
 with it screwing up the highest and 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:26.530
 head to the 2 1-guide for the ulmer 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:28.030
 the sparrows can still enjoy the game 

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:32.370
 turn and win at the end earned with 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.370
 2 1 against the fc germania friedrichstal
