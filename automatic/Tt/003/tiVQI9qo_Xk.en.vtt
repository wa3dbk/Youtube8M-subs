00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:26.759 
any longer to make than any of the
others<00:00:25.480> because<00:00:25.720> of<00:00:25.960> these<00:00:26.079> drop<00:00:26.409> stitches

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:26.769 
others because of these drop stitches

others because of these drop stitches
they<00:00:27.039> really<00:00:27.400> have<00:00:27.550> a<00:00:27.579> lot<00:00:27.849> of<00:00:27.970> mileage<00:00:28.210> so<00:00:28.960> I'm

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:29.109

stitch then we will talk about the

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:36.959 
stitch then we will talk about the
decrease<00:00:34.840> that<00:00:35.079> happens<00:00:35.470> at<00:00:36.430> the<00:00:36.579> bottom<00:00:36.850> of

00:00:36.959 --> 00:00:36.969 
decrease that happens at the bottom of

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:41.189

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:43.020 
the bag and lastly I'll show you really
quickly<00:00:41.559> how<00:00:41.829> to<00:00:41.859> create<00:00:42.340> the<00:00:42.519> twists<00:00:42.820> that

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:43.030 
quickly how to create the twists that

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:46.020 
quickly how to create the twists that
are<00:00:43.180> in<00:00:43.359> the<00:00:43.980> contrasting<00:00:44.980> handles<00:00:45.370> alright

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:46.030 
are in the contrasting handles alright

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.139 
are in the contrasting handles alright
so<00:00:46.570> let's<00:00:46.719> get<00:00:46.899> started<00:00:46.960> so<00:00:47.969> following<00:00:48.969> the

00:00:49.139 --> 00:00:49.149 
so let's get started so following the

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:56.160 
so let's get started so following the
directions<00:00:50.640> the<00:00:51.640> stitch<00:00:51.910> pattern<00:00:54.989> has<00:00:55.989> some

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:56.170 
directions the stitch pattern has some

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:00.360 
directions the stitch pattern has some
rows<00:00:56.410> of<00:00:56.589> garter<00:00:56.920> and<00:00:58.710> I've<00:00:59.710> cast<00:00:59.920> on<00:01:00.129> less

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:00.370 
rows of garter and I've cast on less

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:02.669 
rows of garter and I've cast on less
stitches<00:01:00.789> here<00:01:01.000> than<00:01:01.179> in<00:01:01.480> the<00:01:01.839> actual<00:01:02.499> bag

00:01:02.669 --> 00:01:02.679 
stitches here than in the actual bag

00:01:02.679 --> 00:01:04.229 
stitches here than in the actual bag
pattern<00:01:03.070> just<00:01:03.249> because<00:01:03.489> it's<00:01:03.609> easier<00:01:03.910> to<00:01:03.940> show

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:04.239 
pattern just because it's easier to show

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:07.260 
pattern just because it's easier to show
it's<00:01:04.449> not<00:01:04.510> as<00:01:04.720> bulky<00:01:04.930> so<00:01:05.740> I<00:01:06.070> am<00:01:06.640> actually<00:01:06.850> on

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:07.270 
it's not as bulky so I am actually on

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.950 
it's not as bulky so I am actually on
I've<00:01:08.229> done<00:01:08.500> all<00:01:08.619> the<00:01:08.799> garter<00:01:09.130> stitch<00:01:09.960> rows

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:10.960 
I've done all the garter stitch rows

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.039 
I've done all the garter stitch rows
which<00:01:11.229> is<00:01:11.380> six<00:01:11.590> rows<00:01:11.829> and<00:01:12.280> now<00:01:13.090> I'm<00:01:13.450> ready<00:01:13.750> to

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:14.049 
which is six rows and now I'm ready to

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:17.100 
which is six rows and now I'm ready to
do<00:01:14.259> the<00:01:14.770> row<00:01:15.250> seven<00:01:15.700> which<00:01:15.820> is<00:01:15.850> where<00:01:16.299> we<00:01:16.540> start

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:17.110 
do the row seven which is where we start

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:23.160 
do the row seven which is where we start
the<00:01:18.869> first<00:01:19.869> step<00:01:20.290> for<00:01:20.560> the<00:01:21.930> drop<00:01:22.930> stitches

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:23.170 
the first step for the drop stitches

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:24.210 
the first step for the drop stitches
that<00:01:23.409> you're<00:01:23.530> going<00:01:23.649> to<00:01:23.710> see<00:01:23.860> that<00:01:23.950> creates

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:24.220 
that you're going to see that creates

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.230 
that you're going to see that creates
all<00:01:24.340> that<00:01:24.460> mileage<00:01:24.850> so<00:01:25.600> we're<00:01:25.899> knitting<00:01:26.110> one

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
all that mileage so we're knitting one

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:38.820 
all that mileage so we're knitting one
wrapping<00:01:28.240> three<00:01:28.659> times<00:01:31.680> knit<00:01:33.030> that<00:01:34.030> wrap<00:01:34.899> wrap

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:38.830 

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:41.760 

and<00:01:39.610> you<00:01:39.880> just<00:01:40.030> do<00:01:40.210> that<00:01:40.240> as<00:01:40.930> a<00:01:40.990> pattern<00:01:41.350> calls

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:41.770 
and you just do that as a pattern calls

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:44.970 
and you just do that as a pattern calls
for<00:01:42.030> whoops<00:01:43.030> that<00:01:43.150> was<00:01:43.240> only<00:01:43.420> two<00:01:43.680> three<00:01:44.680> times

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:44.980 
for whoops that was only two three times

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:49.260 
for whoops that was only two three times
all<00:01:45.940> the<00:01:46.510> way<00:01:46.540> to<00:01:46.690> the<00:01:46.960> end<00:01:47.170> okay<00:01:47.790> so<00:01:48.790> that's<00:01:49.090> on

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:49.270 
all the way to the end okay so that's on

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.240 
all the way to the end okay so that's on
the<00:01:49.420> right<00:01:49.630> side<00:01:49.930> the<00:01:50.140> pot<00:01:50.320> the<00:01:50.590> public<00:01:51.040> side

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.250 
the right side the pot the public side

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:54.570 
the right side the pot the public side
of<00:01:51.370> the<00:01:51.460> fabric<00:01:51.850> so<00:01:52.060> then<00:01:53.250> once<00:01:54.250> I've<00:01:54.430> done

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:54.580 
of the fabric so then once I've done

00:01:54.580 --> 00:01:57.890 
of the fabric so then once I've done
that<00:01:54.640> all<00:01:55.000> the<00:01:55.150> way<00:01:55.270> across<00:01:55.680> as<00:01:56.680> I<00:01:56.950> have<00:01:57.130> here

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:57.900 
that all the way across as I have here

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.990 
that all the way across as I have here
we<00:01:58.900> flip<00:01:59.170> it<00:01:59.290> over<00:01:59.470> to<00:02:00.010> what<00:02:00.190> is<00:02:00.310> now<00:02:00.520> the<00:02:00.550> back

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:01.000 
we flip it over to what is now the back

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.890 
we flip it over to what is now the back
side<00:02:02.430> and<00:02:03.430> you<00:02:03.940> can<00:02:04.120> see<00:02:04.150> it<00:02:04.540> looks<00:02:04.690> like<00:02:04.750> I

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:04.900 
side and you can see it looks like I

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:06.840 
side and you can see it looks like I
have<00:02:05.080> a<00:02:05.110> gajillion<00:02:05.320> stitches<00:02:06.250> because<00:02:06.610> of<00:02:06.700> all

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 
have a gajillion stitches because of all

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:15.060 
have a gajillion stitches because of all
those<00:02:07.030> yarn<00:02:07.420> wraps<00:02:11.130> so<00:02:12.130> in<00:02:12.280> this<00:02:12.490> row<00:02:13.950> since<00:02:14.950> we

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:15.070 
those yarn wraps so in this row since we

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:19.860 
those yarn wraps so in this row since we
don't<00:02:15.190> want<00:02:15.310> to<00:02:15.490> increase<00:02:18.480> by<00:02:19.480> so<00:02:19.750> many

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:19.870 
don't want to increase by so many

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.390 
don't want to increase by so many
stitches<00:02:20.200> or<00:02:20.500> by<00:02:20.620> any<00:02:20.770> stitches<00:02:21.130> at<00:02:21.250> all

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:21.400 
stitches or by any stitches at all

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.160 
stitches or by any stitches at all
rather<00:02:21.580> we're<00:02:22.300> gonna<00:02:22.420> knit<00:02:22.720> all<00:02:22.840> the<00:02:22.990> knit

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
rather we're gonna knit all the knit

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.030 
rather we're gonna knit all the knit
stitches<00:02:23.910> so<00:02:24.910> this<00:02:25.060> one's<00:02:25.270> knit<00:02:25.540> and<00:02:26.040> then

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:27.040 
stitches so this one's knit and then

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.850 
stitches so this one's knit and then
drop<00:02:27.690> meaning<00:02:28.690> letting<00:02:28.960> the<00:02:29.050> loops<00:02:29.290> fall<00:02:29.650> off

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:29.860 
drop meaning letting the loops fall off

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.850 
drop meaning letting the loops fall off
all<00:02:30.550> the<00:02:31.030> yarn<00:02:31.240> overs<00:02:31.600> and<00:02:32.290> it'll<00:02:32.590> look<00:02:32.740> a

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:32.860 
all the yarn overs and it'll look a

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:43.080 
all the yarn overs and it'll look a
little<00:02:33.010> scraggly<00:02:33.430> at<00:02:33.850> first<00:02:35.190> knit<00:02:38.010> let<00:02:39.010> drop

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:49.979 

nitch<00:02:47.459> electron<00:02:48.459> and<00:02:48.819> you'll<00:02:49.420> do<00:02:49.569> that<00:02:49.690> all

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
nitch electron and you'll do that all

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:52.170 
nitch electron and you'll do that all
the<00:02:50.379> way<00:02:50.500> across<00:02:50.950> and<00:02:51.370> that<00:02:51.430> series<00:02:51.849> of<00:02:51.970> eight

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:52.180 
the way across and that series of eight

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.660 
the way across and that series of eight
rows<00:02:52.450> is<00:02:52.810> going<00:02:53.019> to<00:02:53.080> create<00:02:53.349> the<00:02:54.099> drop<00:02:54.340> stitch

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
rows is going to create the drop stitch

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.390 
rows is going to create the drop stitch
pattern<00:02:55.180> and<00:02:55.720> you<00:02:55.900> can<00:02:55.930> see<00:02:56.349> what<00:02:57.099> it<00:02:57.220> looks

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
pattern and you can see what it looks

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:59.460 
pattern and you can see what it looks
like<00:02:57.489> there<00:02:57.940> you'll<00:02:58.510> give<00:02:58.720> it<00:02:58.840> a<00:02:58.930> little<00:02:59.140> tug

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
like there you'll give it a little tug

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.710 
like there you'll give it a little tug
and<00:02:59.500> everything<00:03:00.160> will<00:03:00.310> cinch<00:03:00.580> up<00:03:00.760> and<00:03:01.599> it

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
and everything will cinch up and it

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.770 
and everything will cinch up and it
gives<00:03:01.959> you<00:03:02.290> a<00:03:02.879> lot<00:03:03.879> of<00:03:03.910> mileage<00:03:04.420> I<00:03:04.540> would<00:03:04.660> say

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
gives you a lot of mileage I would say

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:06.479 
gives you a lot of mileage I would say
that's<00:03:04.930> a<00:03:05.049> good<00:03:05.319> inch<00:03:05.739> and<00:03:05.980> a<00:03:06.010> half<00:03:06.040> if<00:03:06.459> not

00:03:06.479 --> 00:03:06.489 
that's a good inch and a half if not

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:09.660 
that's a good inch and a half if not
more<00:03:07.110> with<00:03:08.110> just<00:03:08.260> those<00:03:08.500> drop<00:03:08.769> stitches<00:03:09.160> so<00:03:09.610> it

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:09.670 
more with just those drop stitches so it

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:13.259 
more with just those drop stitches so it
goes<00:03:09.819> really<00:03:10.060> quickly<00:03:10.450> at<00:03:11.170> the<00:03:11.650> end<00:03:12.269> the

00:03:13.259 --> 00:03:13.269 
goes really quickly at the end the

00:03:13.269 --> 00:03:15.809 
goes really quickly at the end the
pattern<00:03:13.629> calls<00:03:13.989> for<00:03:14.230> you<00:03:14.560> to<00:03:14.650> do<00:03:14.980> a<00:03:15.340> little<00:03:15.610> bit

00:03:15.809 --> 00:03:15.819 
pattern calls for you to do a little bit

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:21.930 
pattern calls for you to do a little bit
of<00:03:15.940> cinching<00:03:16.450> and<00:03:20.340> the<00:03:21.340> our<00:03:21.459> inspirations

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:21.940 
of cinching and the our inspirations

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:25.319 
of cinching and the our inspirations
designers<00:03:22.480> decided<00:03:23.230> to<00:03:23.530> have<00:03:23.739> you<00:03:24.130> drop<00:03:25.120> the

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:25.329 
designers decided to have you drop the

00:03:25.329 --> 00:03:28.559 
designers decided to have you drop the
stitches<00:03:25.810> and<00:03:26.019> cinch<00:03:26.560> at<00:03:26.799> the<00:03:26.920> same<00:03:27.220> time<00:03:27.670> so

00:03:28.559 --> 00:03:28.569 
stitches and cinch at the same time so

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:33.300 
stitches and cinch at the same time so
what<00:03:28.720> we're<00:03:28.840> gonna<00:03:28.900> do<00:03:31.110> is<00:03:32.110> we<00:03:33.040> are<00:03:33.129> going<00:03:33.250> to

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:33.310 
what we're gonna do is we are going to

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:35.430 
what we're gonna do is we are going to
knit<00:03:33.730> five<00:03:33.970> together<00:03:34.239> but<00:03:34.660> you're<00:03:34.810> dropping

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:35.440 
knit five together but you're dropping

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.190 
knit five together but you're dropping
the<00:03:35.620> the<00:03:36.129> loops<00:03:36.459> the<00:03:36.940> yarn<00:03:37.150> overs<00:03:37.510> so<00:03:37.690> you're

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:38.200 
the the loops the yarn overs so you're

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.339 
the the loops the yarn overs so you're
only<00:03:38.709> knitting<00:03:39.099> the<00:03:39.280> knit<00:03:39.700> stitches<00:03:40.000> together

00:03:40.339 --> 00:03:40.349 
only knitting the knit stitches together

00:03:40.349 --> 00:03:42.990 
only knitting the knit stitches together
so<00:03:41.349> this<00:03:41.500> sounds<00:03:41.890> complicated<00:03:42.069> but<00:03:42.549> it<00:03:42.790> really

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:43.000 
so this sounds complicated but it really

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.119 
so this sounds complicated but it really
isn't<00:03:43.269> once<00:03:43.540> you<00:03:43.660> see<00:03:43.840> it<00:03:43.930> in<00:03:44.019> action<00:03:44.200> so<00:03:44.980> what

00:03:45.119 --> 00:03:45.129 
isn't once you see it in action so what

00:03:45.129 --> 00:03:47.910 
isn't once you see it in action so what
I<00:03:45.160> do<00:03:45.370> and<00:03:46.060> you<00:03:47.049> know<00:03:47.170> there<00:03:47.440> are<00:03:47.560> many<00:03:47.709> ways

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:47.920 
I do and you know there are many ways

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:49.559 
I do and you know there are many ways
I'm<00:03:48.220> sure<00:03:48.400> that<00:03:48.549> you<00:03:48.609> can<00:03:48.760> do<00:03:48.910> this<00:03:49.060> but<00:03:49.239> my

00:03:49.559 --> 00:03:49.569 
I'm sure that you can do this but my

00:03:49.569 --> 00:03:55.460 
I'm sure that you can do this but my
method<00:03:49.810> is<00:03:50.230> that<00:03:51.220> I<00:03:52.470> slip<00:03:53.850> the<00:03:54.850> knit<00:03:55.060> stitches

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:55.470 
method is that I slip the knit stitches

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:00.690 
method is that I slip the knit stitches
drop<00:03:56.470> okay<00:03:56.980> so<00:03:57.040> that's<00:03:57.280> one<00:03:57.489> stitch<00:03:59.489> slip<00:04:00.489> that

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:00.700 
drop okay so that's one stitch slip that

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:03.900 
drop okay so that's one stitch slip that
next<00:04:01.060> one<00:04:01.290> and<00:04:02.290> I<00:04:02.859> continue<00:04:03.400> doing<00:04:03.700> this<00:04:03.849> until

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:03.910 
next one and I continue doing this until

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:18.289 
next one and I continue doing this until
I<00:04:04.299> have

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:26.850 

one<00:04:19.299> two<00:04:19.690> three<00:04:20.229> four<00:04:20.620> five<00:04:21.099> knit<00:04:21.729> stitches<00:04:25.860> on

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:26.860 
one two three four five knit stitches on

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:28.920 
one two three four five knit stitches on
this<00:04:27.520> needle<00:04:27.580> and<00:04:28.060> then<00:04:28.389> you<00:04:28.479> can<00:04:28.599> do<00:04:28.720> one<00:04:28.900> of

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:28.930 
this needle and then you can do one of

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:30.360 
this needle and then you can do one of
two<00:04:29.020> things<00:04:29.169> you<00:04:29.560> could<00:04:29.740> either<00:04:29.919> slip<00:04:30.220> all

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:30.370 
two things you could either slip all

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:34.589 
two things you could either slip all
these<00:04:30.520> back<00:04:30.819> onto<00:04:31.090> the<00:04:31.419> right<00:04:32.349> side<00:04:32.379> and<00:04:33.599> knit

00:04:34.589 --> 00:04:34.599 
these back onto the right side and knit

00:04:34.599 --> 00:04:40.950 
these back onto the right side and knit
them<00:04:34.720> together<00:04:37.919> like<00:04:38.919> that<00:04:39.190> or<00:04:39.879> you<00:04:40.780> could

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:40.960 
them together like that or you could

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.140 
them together like that or you could
keep<00:04:41.080> them<00:04:41.289> on<00:04:41.409> the<00:04:41.560> right<00:04:42.129> hand<00:04:42.400> low<00:04:42.550> right

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:43.150 
keep them on the right hand low right

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:46.260 
keep them on the right hand low right
hand<00:04:43.389> side<00:04:43.629> I<00:04:44.340> just<00:04:45.340> said<00:04:45.699> slip<00:04:45.909> them<00:04:46.000> over<00:04:46.210> to

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:46.270 
hand side I just said slip them over to

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:47.490 
hand side I just said slip them over to
the<00:04:46.330> right<00:04:46.419> side<00:04:46.659> I'm<00:04:46.780> at<00:04:46.930> left<00:04:47.110> side<00:04:47.169> now<00:04:47.440> you

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:47.500 
the right side I'm at left side now you

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:48.960 
the right side I'm at left side now you
could<00:04:47.800> just<00:04:47.830> keep<00:04:48.159> them<00:04:48.370> to<00:04:48.460> the<00:04:48.550> right<00:04:48.669> side

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:48.970 
could just keep them to the right side

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:50.580 
could just keep them to the right side
and<00:04:49.210> you<00:04:49.599> could<00:04:49.750> knit<00:04:49.960> them<00:04:50.110> through<00:04:50.289> the<00:04:50.380> back

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:50.590 
and you could knit them through the back

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:52.230 
and you could knit them through the back
loop<00:04:50.919> so<00:04:51.159> you<00:04:51.220> insert<00:04:51.610> the<00:04:51.789> needle<00:04:52.060> through

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:52.240 
loop so you insert the needle through

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:58.469 
loop so you insert the needle through
the<00:04:52.270> front<00:04:54.060> yarn<00:04:55.060> over<00:04:55.449> knit<00:04:57.000> all<00:04:58.000> five<00:04:58.449> of

00:04:58.469 --> 00:04:58.479 
the front yarn over knit all five of

00:04:58.479 --> 00:05:00.360 
the front yarn over knit all five of
those<00:04:58.750> loops<00:04:59.110> together<00:04:59.349> and<00:04:59.800> then<00:05:00.250> you're

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:00.370 
those loops together and then you're

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:01.710 
those loops together and then you're
just<00:05:00.460> gonna<00:05:00.610> continue<00:05:01.120> in<00:05:01.210> that<00:05:01.240> matter

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:01.720 
just gonna continue in that matter

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:03.570 
just gonna continue in that matter
I'm<00:05:02.229> slipping<00:05:02.680> all<00:05:02.979> the<00:05:03.099> knit<00:05:03.280> stitches

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:03.580 
I'm slipping all the knit stitches

00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:05.939 
I'm slipping all the knit stitches
dropping<00:05:04.449> the<00:05:04.569> yarn<00:05:04.750> overs<00:05:05.080> and<00:05:05.259> then<00:05:05.500> either
