can<00:01:22.830> swap<00:01:23.189> its<00:01:23.490> position<00:01:24.000> with<00:01:24.119> another<00:01:24.450> icon

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
can swap its position with another icon

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.780 
can swap its position with another icon
so<00:01:25.320> say<00:01:25.500> for<00:01:25.530> instance<00:01:25.799> i<00:01:26.250> want<00:01:26.640> this

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:26.790 
so say for instance i want this

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.940 
so say for instance i want this
particular<00:01:27.119> one<00:01:27.479> where<00:01:27.750> the<00:01:27.869> icon<00:01:28.259> one<00:01:28.530> is<00:01:28.740> so

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:28.950 
particular one where the icon one is so

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.160 
particular one where the icon one is so
i<00:01:29.009> can<00:01:29.189> type<00:01:29.340> that<00:01:29.579> there<00:01:29.820> hit<00:01:30.420> swap<00:01:30.780> and<00:01:31.079> it

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
i can type that there hit swap and it

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:32.929 
i can type that there hit swap and it
moves<00:01:31.350> its<00:01:31.530> position<00:01:32.009> and<00:01:32.220> then<00:01:32.400> the<00:01:32.610> last

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
moves its position and then the last

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.450 
moves its position and then the last
option<00:01:33.329> let<00:01:34.079> me<00:01:34.170> get<00:01:34.290> that<00:01:34.409> menu<00:01:34.619> you<00:01:35.009> can<00:01:35.040> set

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
option let me get that menu you can set

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.819 
option let me get that menu you can set
the<00:01:35.610> icon<00:01:36.030> position<00:01:36.630> so<00:01:36.990> in<00:01:37.170> selecting<00:01:37.710> that

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
the icon position so in selecting that

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:39.429 
the icon position so in selecting that
you<00:01:38.009> pretty<00:01:38.250> much<00:01:38.310> get<00:01:38.640> a<00:01:38.850> more<00:01:39.119> accurate

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:39.439 
you pretty much get a more accurate

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:41.510 
you pretty much get a more accurate
position<00:01:40.439> of<00:01:40.560> where<00:01:40.680> the<00:01:40.799> icons<00:01:41.130> are<00:01:41.280> going<00:01:41.430> to

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
position of where the icons are going to

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.340 
position of where the icons are going to
be<00:01:41.670> because<00:01:42.060> you<00:01:42.270> can<00:01:42.450> type<00:01:42.689> in<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:42.960> X&amp;Y

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
be because you can type in the X&amp;Y

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:44.990 
be because you can type in the X&amp;Y
numbers<00:01:43.860> and<00:01:44.040> it<00:01:44.100> will<00:01:44.220> move<00:01:44.399> to<00:01:44.549> that<00:01:44.640> exact

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
numbers and it will move to that exact

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.030 
numbers and it will move to that exact
spot<00:01:45.119> you<00:01:45.659> also<00:01:45.840> have<00:01:46.079> the<00:01:46.200> option<00:01:46.229> to<00:01:46.560> turn<00:01:46.860> on

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
spot you also have the option to turn on

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.710 
spot you also have the option to turn on
the<00:01:47.130> grid<00:01:47.369> so<00:01:47.670> you<00:01:47.759> can<00:01:47.909> have<00:01:48.090> pretty<00:01:48.390> much<00:01:48.450> a

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:48.720 
the grid so you can have pretty much a

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.139 
the grid so you can have pretty much a
snap<00:01:49.079> to<00:01:49.110> God<00:01:49.530> as<00:01:49.740> far<00:01:49.979> as<00:01:50.070> where<00:01:50.220> the<00:01:50.340> icons<00:01:50.790> go

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
snap to God as far as where the icons go

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.510 
snap to God as far as where the icons go
and<00:01:51.450> you<00:01:51.990> can<00:01:52.140> also<00:01:52.290> pinch<00:01:52.829> the<00:01:53.040> grid<00:01:53.280> so<00:01:53.490> that

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:53.520 
and you can also pinch the grid so that

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.219 
and you can also pinch the grid so that
the<00:01:53.670> grid<00:01:53.880> is<00:01:53.909> smaller<00:01:54.299> are<00:01:54.570> spread<00:01:54.960> it<00:01:55.110> so

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
the grid is smaller are spread it so

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:57.830 
the grid is smaller are spread it so
that<00:01:55.409> it<00:01:55.500> is<00:01:55.619> bigger<00:01:55.920> and<00:01:56.250> then<00:01:57.030> over<00:01:57.420> here<00:01:57.450> in

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
that it is bigger and then over here in

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.480 
that it is bigger and then over here in
the<00:01:58.020> bottom<00:01:58.259> right<00:01:58.590> corner<00:01:58.619> you<00:01:59.070> can<00:01:59.219> change

the bottom right corner you can change
the<00:01:59.670> background<00:01:59.880> image<00:02:00.630> so<00:02:01.079> say<00:02:01.259> for<00:02:01.290> instance

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
the background image so say for instance

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.469 
the background image so say for instance

also change the eye
image<00:02:14.200> itself<00:02:14.620> so<00:02:15.250> that<00:02:15.280> if<00:02:15.610> you<00:02:15.760> have<00:02:15.940> a

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:15.970 
image itself so that if you have a

00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:17.760 
image itself so that if you have a
particular<00:02:16.180> theme<00:02:16.720> you're<00:02:16.900> using<00:02:16.960> and<00:02:17.560> you

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:17.770 
particular theme you're using and you

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:19.560 
particular theme you're using and you
want<00:02:18.100> to<00:02:18.250> make<00:02:18.400> sure<00:02:18.430> that<00:02:18.790> when<00:02:18.970> you<00:02:19.120> position

want to make sure that when you position
things<00:02:19.990> that<00:02:20.230> it<00:02:20.320> captures<00:02:20.770> the<00:02:20.950> theme<00:02:21.250> itself

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:21.610 
things that it captures the theme itself

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.970 
things that it captures the theme itself
due<00:02:22.540> to<00:02:22.720> the<00:02:22.840> icons<00:02:23.260> being<00:02:23.500> a<00:02:23.560> little<00:02:23.710> bit<00:02:23.860> more

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
due to the icons being a little bit more

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:26.160 
due to the icons being a little bit more
different<00:02:24.550> then<00:02:24.910> you<00:02:25.030> can<00:02:25.180> choose<00:02:25.450> that<00:02:25.690> icon

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:26.170 
different then you can choose that icon

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.440 
different then you can choose that icon
theme<00:02:26.470> and<00:02:26.770> then<00:02:27.400> just<00:02:27.730> go<00:02:27.880> back<00:02:28.060> to<00:02:28.090> your<00:02:28.240> home
