okay<00:02:23.310> so<00:02:23.640> now<00:02:23.790> if<00:02:23.880> we<00:02:23.940> tidy<00:02:24.330> that<00:02:24.510> up<00:02:24.569> a<00:02:24.810> little

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:25.080 
okay so now if we tidy that up a little

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.460 
okay so now if we tidy that up a little
tap<00:02:25.920> on<00:02:26.099> the<00:02:26.130> topic<00:02:26.970> and<00:02:27.180> then<00:02:27.780> choose<00:02:28.050> a<00:02:28.080> line

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:28.470 
tap on the topic and then choose a line

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.750 
tap on the topic and then choose a line
and<00:02:28.770> then<00:02:29.099> children<00:02:30.860> that<00:02:31.860> will<00:02:32.040> organize

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:32.760 
and then children that will organize

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:40.200 
and then children that will organize
those<00:02:32.970> topics

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:40.210 

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:44.850 

if<00:02:40.630> we<00:02:41.050> are<00:02:41.820> hit<00:02:42.820> space<00:02:43.720> three<00:02:44.170> times<00:02:44.440> in<00:02:44.770> the

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:44.860 
if we are hit space three times in the

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:47.310 
if we are hit space three times in the
middle<00:02:45.190> of<00:02:45.250> the<00:02:45.310> topic<00:02:45.640> text<00:02:46.060> that<00:02:46.840> will<00:02:46.960> split

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:47.320 
middle of the topic text that will split

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:51.060 
middle of the topic text that will split
the<00:02:47.410> topic<00:02:47.740> into<00:02:47.950> two<00:02:49.500> same<00:02:50.500> thing<00:02:50.740> happens

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:51.070 
the topic into two same thing happens

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:54.660 
the topic into two same thing happens
with<00:02:52.320> splitting<00:02:53.320> a<00:02:53.500> topic<00:02:53.830> into<00:02:54.070> two<00:02:54.220> siblings

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:54.670 
with splitting a topic into two siblings

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.090 
with splitting a topic into two siblings
so<00:02:54.970> if<00:02:55.060> we<00:02:55.240> hit<00:02:55.570> enter<00:02:55.780> three<00:02:56.470> times<00:02:56.740> in<00:02:57.040> the

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
so if we hit enter three times in the

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.000 
so if we hit enter three times in the
middle<00:02:57.280> of<00:02:57.340> a<00:02:57.400> topic<00:02:58.530> that<00:02:59.530> we'll<00:02:59.680> split<00:02:59.890> the

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010 
middle of a topic that we'll split the

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.950 
middle of a topic that we'll split the
topic<00:03:00.400> into<00:03:00.760> siblings<00:03:03.450> we<00:03:04.450> can<00:03:04.630> merge

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:04.960 
topic into siblings we can merge

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:06.840 
topic into siblings we can merge
together<00:03:05.290> two<00:03:05.620> topics<00:03:06.010> by<00:03:06.280> pressing<00:03:06.730> and

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:06.850 
together two topics by pressing and

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:09.120 
together two topics by pressing and
holding<00:03:06.910> and<00:03:07.420> dragging<00:03:07.590> and<00:03:08.590> dropping<00:03:08.740> and

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:09.130 
holding and dragging and dropping and

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:12.180 
holding and dragging and dropping and
choosing<00:03:09.850> merge<00:03:10.380> that<00:03:11.380> will<00:03:11.500> then<00:03:11.620> merge<00:03:11.920> the

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:12.190 
choosing merge that will then merge the

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:14.940 
choosing merge that will then merge the
text<00:03:12.580> of<00:03:12.640> the<00:03:12.700> two<00:03:12.880> topics<00:03:13.270> and<00:03:13.860> reassign<00:03:14.860> the

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:14.950 
text of the two topics and reassign the

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.970 
text of the two topics and reassign the
children<00:03:15.870> so<00:03:16.870> now<00:03:16.990> if<00:03:17.050> we<00:03:17.110> tie<00:03:17.350> to<00:03:17.410> that<00:03:17.500> map<00:03:17.800> up

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:17.980 
children so now if we tie to that map up

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:20.820 
children so now if we tie to that map up
choose<00:03:18.940> a<00:03:18.970> line<00:03:19.330> that<00:03:19.930> will<00:03:20.050> align<00:03:20.380> all<00:03:20.590> the

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:20.830 
choose a line that will align all the

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:24.630 
choose a line that will align all the
all<00:03:21.490> the<00:03:21.550> branches<00:03:22.980> so<00:03:23.980> now<00:03:24.100> what<00:03:24.280> we<00:03:24.370> can<00:03:24.520> do

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 
all the branches so now what we can do

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.840 
all the branches so now what we can do
is<00:03:24.760> select<00:03:24.970> topic<00:03:25.420> and<00:03:25.600> choose<00:03:26.020> copy<00:03:26.380> I<00:03:26.850> copies

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:27.850 
is select topic and choose copy I copies

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:30.990 
is select topic and choose copy I copies
the<00:03:27.970> branch<00:03:28.180> to<00:03:28.330> the<00:03:28.420> clipboard<00:03:29.550> if<00:03:30.550> we<00:03:30.640> tap<00:03:30.880> on

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:31.000 
the branch to the clipboard if we tap on

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.930 
the branch to the clipboard if we tap on
the<00:03:31.030> background<00:03:31.540> and<00:03:31.810> choose<00:03:32.800> paste<00:03:33.100> that

branch<00:03:34.300> will<00:03:34.480> be<00:03:34.510> pasted<00:03:35.080> at<00:03:35.170> that<00:03:35.290> location

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:38.130 

00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:41.940 

if<00:03:39.130> we<00:03:39.190> copy<00:03:39.700> that<00:03:39.910> branch<00:03:40.180> again<00:03:40.570> and<00:03:40.950> then

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:41.950 
if we copy that branch again and then

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:45.690 
if we copy that branch again and then
tap<00:03:42.250> on<00:03:42.370> the<00:03:42.430> background<00:03:43.650> we<00:03:44.650> can<00:03:44.860> paste<00:03:45.310> it<00:03:45.490> as

tap on the background we can paste it as

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.290 
tap on the background we can paste it as
a<00:03:45.730> floating<00:03:46.090> branch<00:03:46.510> now<00:03:46.810> I<00:03:48.030> create<00:03:49.030> a<00:03:49.060> new

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:49.300 
a floating branch now I create a new

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:53.220 
a floating branch now I create a new
floating<00:03:49.570> branch<00:03:51.240> we<00:03:52.240> can<00:03:52.390> then<00:03:52.570> press<00:03:53.020> and

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:53.230 
floating branch we can then press and

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:56.700 
floating branch we can then press and
hold<00:03:53.290> on<00:03:53.830> a<00:03:53.890> topic<00:03:54.580> and<00:03:54.910> then<00:03:55.870> drag<00:03:56.230> and<00:03:56.500> drop

00:03:56.700 --> 00:03:56.710 
hold on a topic and then drag and drop

00:03:56.710 --> 00:04:00.110 
hold on a topic and then drag and drop
it<00:03:56.890> onto<00:03:57.100> another<00:03:57.340> topic<00:03:58.470> so<00:03:59.470> press<00:03:59.770> and<00:04:00.010> hold

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:00.120 
it onto another topic so press and hold

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:04.920 
it onto another topic so press and hold
drag<00:04:01.120> and<00:04:01.390> drop<00:04:01.840> and<00:04:02.460> then<00:04:03.460> move<00:04:03.780> that<00:04:04.780> is

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:04.930 
drag and drop and then move that is

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:07.640 
drag and drop and then move that is
essentially<00:04:05.620> a<00:04:05.830> copy<00:04:06.430> and<00:04:06.640> paste<00:04:06.910> operation

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:07.650 
essentially a copy and paste operation

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:10.080 
essentially a copy and paste operation
we<00:04:08.650> can<00:04:08.800> then<00:04:08.920> press<00:04:09.160> and<00:04:09.340> hold<00:04:09.370> the<00:04:09.700> floating

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.090 
we can then press and hold the floating

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:12.330 
we can then press and hold the floating
topic<00:04:10.270> and<00:04:10.630> drag<00:04:11.500> and<00:04:11.620> drop<00:04:11.800> it<00:04:11.980> onto<00:04:12.130> another

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:12.340 
topic and drag and drop it onto another

00:04:12.340 --> 00:04:15.060 
topic and drag and drop it onto another
topic<00:04:12.460> and<00:04:12.970> choose<00:04:13.390> merge<00:04:13.690> that<00:04:14.680> will<00:04:14.800> merge

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:15.070 
topic and choose merge that will merge

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:16.740 
topic and choose merge that will merge
the<00:04:15.310> text<00:04:15.610> of<00:04:15.670> the<00:04:15.730> two<00:04:15.910> topics<00:04:16.299> and<00:04:16.540> then

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:16.750 
the text of the two topics and then

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:20.490 
the text of the two topics and then
reassign<00:04:17.200> the<00:04:17.320> children<00:04:19.020> ok<00:04:20.020> so<00:04:20.080> that's<00:04:20.380> the

00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:20.500 
reassign the children ok so that's the

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:23.850 
reassign the children ok so that's the
basics<00:04:20.920> of<00:04:21.210> manipulating<00:04:22.380> topics<00:04:23.380> in<00:04:23.620> I

00:04:23.850 --> 00:04:23.860
