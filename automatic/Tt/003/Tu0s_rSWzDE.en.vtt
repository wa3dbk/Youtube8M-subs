bit<00:03:05.319> of<00:03:05.409> a<00:03:05.470> glitch<00:03:05.709> by<00:03:05.950> himself<00:03:06.280> he<00:03:06.879> hasn't

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
bit of a glitch by himself he hasn't

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.990 
bit of a glitch by himself he hasn't
been<00:03:07.269> playing<00:03:07.510> with<00:03:07.629> other<00:03:07.810> people<00:03:08.290> so<00:03:09.099> what's

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:10.000 
been playing with other people so what's

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.129 
been playing with other people so what's
one<00:03:10.180> of<00:03:10.209> the<00:03:10.389> things<00:03:10.450> that's<00:03:10.780> holding<00:03:10.900> him

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:11.139 
one of the things that's holding him

00:03:11.139 --> 00:03:13.860 
one of the things that's holding him
back<00:03:11.290> obviously<00:03:12.060> it's<00:03:13.060> going<00:03:13.239> to<00:03:13.359> be<00:03:13.510> if<00:03:13.750> he

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:13.870 
back obviously it's going to be if he

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:15.539 
back obviously it's going to be if he
just<00:03:14.019> went<00:03:14.139> online<00:03:14.379> there's<00:03:15.010> probably<00:03:15.370> and

00:03:15.539 --> 00:03:15.549 
just went online there's probably and

00:03:15.549 --> 00:03:16.890 
just went online there's probably and
played<00:03:15.760> with<00:03:15.909> some<00:03:16.090> people<00:03:16.389> there's<00:03:16.569> probably

00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:16.900 
played with some people there's probably

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.300 
played with some people there's probably
a<00:03:16.989> really<00:03:17.229> good<00:03:17.470> chance<00:03:17.739> he<00:03:17.889> would<00:03:18.010> probably

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:18.310 
a really good chance he would probably

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:20.759 
a really good chance he would probably
get<00:03:18.400> a<00:03:18.430> shotgun<00:03:18.760> so<00:03:19.150> there's<00:03:19.959> always<00:03:20.229> been

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:20.769 
get a shotgun so there's always been

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:22.920 
get a shotgun so there's always been
other<00:03:21.010> factors<00:03:21.639> now<00:03:21.940> I<00:03:21.970> had<00:03:22.479> every<00:03:22.780> other

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:22.930 
other factors now I had every other

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:25.710 
other factors now I had every other
factor<00:03:23.440> on<00:03:23.739> this<00:03:24.430> account<00:03:24.849> the<00:03:25.150> only<00:03:25.449> thing<00:03:25.629> I

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:25.720 
factor on this account the only thing I

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.020 
factor on this account the only thing I
needed<00:03:25.930> was<00:03:26.049> the<00:03:26.319> kills<00:03:26.590> and<00:03:26.889> maybe<00:03:27.760> like<00:03:28.000> a

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:28.030 
needed was the kills and maybe like a

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:29.580 
needed was the kills and maybe like a
high<00:03:28.239> round<00:03:28.540> but<00:03:28.720> I<00:03:28.750> think<00:03:29.169> I<00:03:29.199> had<00:03:29.349> a<00:03:29.379> high

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:29.590 
high round but I think I had a high

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.469 
high round but I think I had a high
round<00:03:29.829> on<00:03:29.919> this<00:03:30.040> account<00:03:30.370> but<00:03:30.790> some<00:03:31.329> of<00:03:31.419> the

00:03:31.469 --> 00:03:31.479 
round on this account but some of the

00:03:31.479 --> 00:03:33.000 
round on this account but some of the
factors<00:03:31.870> are<00:03:31.959> going<00:03:32.019> to<00:03:32.109> be<00:03:32.169> like<00:03:32.470> one<00:03:32.799> we

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
factors are going to be like one we

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:34.050 
factors are going to be like one we
found<00:03:33.190> out<00:03:33.400> you<00:03:33.579> know<00:03:33.669> you've<00:03:33.819> got<00:03:33.940> at<00:03:34.030> least

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
found out you know you've got at least

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:37.080 
found out you know you've got at least
achieve<00:03:34.889> five<00:03:35.889> tallies<00:03:36.340> and<00:03:36.400> blue<00:03:36.669> eyes<00:03:36.849> at

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.090 
achieve five tallies and blue eyes at

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:38.550 
achieve five tallies and blue eyes at
least<00:03:37.269> one<00:03:37.720> so<00:03:37.900> you<00:03:37.959> have<00:03:38.079> to<00:03:38.199> get<00:03:38.319> that<00:03:38.440> at

00:03:38.550 --> 00:03:38.560 
least one so you have to get that at

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:41.729 
least one so you have to get that at
least<00:03:38.739> once<00:03:39.010> um<00:03:39.810> so<00:03:40.810> we<00:03:40.959> think<00:03:41.169> you<00:03:41.470> know<00:03:41.560> if

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:41.739 
least once um so we think you know if

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:44.009 
least once um so we think you know if
not<00:03:41.949> it's<00:03:42.280> not<00:03:42.370> a<00:03:42.430> big<00:03:42.639> deal<00:03:42.849> you<00:03:43.510> know<00:03:43.540> getting

00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:44.019 
not it's not a big deal you know getting

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:45.719 
not it's not a big deal you know getting
the<00:03:44.049> high<00:03:44.199> rounds<00:03:44.650> definitely<00:03:45.040> does<00:03:45.190> help<00:03:45.430> uh

00:03:45.719 --> 00:03:45.729 
the high rounds definitely does help uh

00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:25.370 
most people do have though so they don't

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:27.100 
most people do have though so they don't
expect<00:04:25.790> that<00:04:26.000> they<00:04:26.150> didn't<00:04:26.389> get<00:04:26.450> their<00:04:26.660> KT<00:04:26.930> and

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:27.110 
expect that they didn't get their KT and

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:28.240 
expect that they didn't get their KT and
they're<00:04:27.230> gonna<00:04:27.350> keep<00:04:27.560> doing<00:04:27.860> it<00:04:27.980> doing<00:04:28.100> it

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:28.250 
they're gonna keep doing it doing it

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:29.350 
they're gonna keep doing it doing it
doing<00:04:28.310> it<00:04:28.520> but<00:04:28.700> when<00:04:28.820> they<00:04:28.910> have<00:04:29.060> a<00:04:29.090> really

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:29.360 
doing it but when they have a really

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:31.629 
doing it but when they have a really
good<00:04:29.450> KT<00:04:29.720> it's<00:04:29.930> not<00:04:30.080> the<00:04:30.200> case<00:04:30.440> so<00:04:31.250> it's<00:04:31.520> you

00:04:31.629 --> 00:04:31.639 
good KT it's not the case so it's you

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:34.090 
good KT it's not the case so it's you
know<00:04:31.730> it's<00:04:31.760> different<00:04:32.210> from<00:04:32.330> everybody<00:04:33.100> like

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:34.100 
know it's different from everybody like

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:35.170 
know it's different from everybody like
I<00:04:34.190> said<00:04:34.340> a<00:04:34.370> lot<00:04:34.550> of<00:04:34.580> things<00:04:34.820> that<00:04:34.910> I'm<00:04:35.000> seeing

00:04:35.170 --> 00:04:35.180 
I said a lot of things that I'm seeing

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:37.140 
I said a lot of things that I'm seeing
right<00:04:35.300> now<00:04:35.389> is<00:04:35.720> the<00:04:35.870> people<00:04:36.200> that<00:04:36.230> have<00:04:36.500> like

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:37.150 
right now is the people that have like

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:40.750 
right now is the people that have like
15<00:04:38.150> to<00:04:38.419> 20,000<00:04:39.050> kills<00:04:39.290> and<00:04:39.650> they<00:04:40.490> have<00:04:40.730> a

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:40.760 
15 to 20,000 kills and they have a

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:42.520 
15 to 20,000 kills and they have a
really<00:04:41.389> good<00:04:41.510> Katie<00:04:41.840> Ann<00:04:41.990> or<00:04:42.139> like<00:04:42.290> why<00:04:42.470> don't

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:42.530 
really good Katie Ann or like why don't

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:44.950 
really good Katie Ann or like why don't
I<00:04:42.740> have<00:04:42.980> it<00:04:43.010> it's<00:04:43.820> probably<00:04:44.389> just<00:04:44.540> the<00:04:44.690> kill

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:44.960 
I have it it's probably just the kill

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:46.780 
I have it it's probably just the kill
requirement<00:04:45.530> thing<00:04:45.740> that's<00:04:46.400> all<00:04:46.550> they<00:04:46.669> really

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:46.790 
requirement thing that's all they really

00:04:46.790 --> 00:04:48.280 
requirement thing that's all they really
need<00:04:47.060> is<00:04:47.150> a<00:04:47.210> kill<00:04:47.389> require<00:04:47.690> maybe<00:04:48.020> a<00:04:48.080> high

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:48.290 
need is a kill require maybe a high

00:04:48.290 --> 00:04:50.080 
need is a kill require maybe a high
round<00:04:48.590> we<00:04:48.860> we<00:04:48.980> play<00:04:49.130> online<00:04:49.370> a<00:04:49.610> little<00:04:49.940> bit

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:50.090 
round we we play online a little bit

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:52.450 
round we we play online a little bit
that's<00:04:51.080> all<00:04:51.260> they're<00:04:51.440> missing<00:04:51.470> like<00:04:51.950> the

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:52.460 
that's all they're missing like the

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:54.790 
that's all they're missing like the
Katie<00:04:52.729> thing<00:04:53.090> they<00:04:53.600> put<00:04:53.840> into<00:04:53.960> place<00:04:54.200> and<00:04:54.530> the

00:04:54.790 --> 00:04:54.800 
Katie thing they put into place and the

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.050 
Katie thing they put into place and the
reason<00:04:55.010> that<00:04:55.070> there's<00:04:55.250> other<00:04:55.400> factors<00:04:55.669> is

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:56.060 
reason that there's other factors is

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:57.460 
reason that there's other factors is
because<00:04:56.389> they<00:04:56.840> don't<00:04:56.990> want<00:04:57.110> you<00:04:57.200> just<00:04:57.350> to<00:04:57.410> make

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:57.470 
because they don't want you just to make

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:59.110 
because they don't want you just to make
a<00:04:57.650> new<00:04:57.830> account<00:04:57.950> alright<00:04:58.610> you<00:04:58.790> make<00:04:58.940> into

00:04:59.110 --> 00:04:59.120 
a new account alright you make into

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:01.960 
a new account alright you make into
account<00:04:59.450> you<00:05:00.139> get<00:05:00.260> 5,000<00:05:01.010> kills<00:05:01.190> your<00:05:01.460> downs<00:05:01.760> I

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:01.970 
account you get 5,000 kills your downs I

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:04.090 
account you get 5,000 kills your downs I
have<00:05:02.060> a<00:05:02.120> 5,000<00:05:02.810> Katie<00:05:02.960> why<00:05:03.680> don't<00:05:03.889> I<00:05:03.950> have

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:04.100 
have a 5,000 Katie why don't I have

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:06.250 
have a 5,000 Katie why don't I have
shotguns<00:05:04.400> I<00:05:04.700> have<00:05:04.820> a<00:05:04.850> 5,000<00:05:05.479> Katie<00:05:05.660> obviously

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:06.260 
shotguns I have a 5,000 Katie obviously

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:08.260 
shotguns I have a 5,000 Katie obviously
there's<00:05:06.860> other<00:05:07.130> little<00:05:07.580> factors<00:05:08.000> that<00:05:08.120> go

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:08.270 
there's other little factors that go

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:10.990 
there's other little factors that go
into<00:05:08.479> it<00:05:08.660> so<00:05:09.080> that's<00:05:09.979> why<00:05:10.310> you<00:05:10.370> got<00:05:10.760> to<00:05:10.790> do

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:11.000 
into it so that's why you got to do

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.550 
into it so that's why you got to do
these<00:05:11.120> other<00:05:11.180> little<00:05:11.570> things<00:05:11.900> but<00:05:12.139> usually

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:12.560 
these other little things but usually

00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:14.830 
these other little things but usually
it's<00:05:12.710> the<00:05:12.740> Katie<00:05:13.070> that<00:05:13.310> hold<00:05:13.520> people<00:05:13.820> back<00:05:13.850> so

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:14.840 
it's the Katie that hold people back so

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:17.050 
it's the Katie that hold people back so
my<00:05:15.770> account<00:05:16.160> actually<00:05:16.520> is<00:05:16.580> a<00:05:16.639> good<00:05:16.760> example

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:17.060

because this is like what a lot of
people<00:05:18.590> have<00:05:18.770> I<00:05:19.100> think<00:05:19.790> I<00:05:20.060> get<00:05:20.210> some<00:05:20.450> ranked<00:05:20.810> up

quick on this account as well we got to
like<00:05:23.690> round<00:05:23.990> like<00:05:24.380> 34<00:05:25.160> I<00:05:25.190> believe<00:05:25.580> 35

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:26.090 
like round like 34 I believe 35

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:28.090 
like round like 34 I believe 35
something<00:05:26.510> like<00:05:26.600> that<00:05:26.750> on<00:05:26.870> origins<00:05:27.380> and<00:05:27.620> as

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:28.100 
something like that on origins and as

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:29.650 
something like that on origins and as
you<00:05:28.220> guys<00:05:28.370> will<00:05:28.520> see<00:05:28.550> I<00:05:28.700> now<00:05:29.000> have<00:05:29.180> shotguns

at<00:05:34.030> 51<00:05:35.030> downs<00:05:35.300> Mike<00:05:35.570> Heaney<00:05:35.810> actually<00:05:36.260> went

at 51 downs Mike Heaney actually went

00:05:36.410 --> 00:05:40.029 
at 51 downs Mike Heaney actually went
down<00:05:36.500> I<00:05:36.680> have<00:05:37.100> a<00:05:37.270> 387<00:05:38.270> Katie<00:05:38.479> now<00:05:38.860> before<00:05:39.860> I<00:05:39.890> had

00:05:40.029 --> 00:05:40.039 
down I have a 387 Katie now before I had

00:05:40.039 --> 00:05:43.240 
down I have a 387 Katie now before I had
a<00:05:40.070> 391<00:05:41.030> so<00:05:41.750> my<00:05:41.900> Katie<00:05:42.169> went<00:05:42.470> down<00:05:42.650> so<00:05:42.950> that<00:05:43.070> tell

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:43.250 
a 391 so my Katie went down so that tell

00:05:43.250 --> 00:05:45.760 
a 391 so my Katie went down so that tell
you<00:05:43.539> obviously<00:05:44.539> it<00:05:44.900> wasn't<00:05:45.050> the<00:05:45.229> Katie<00:05:45.470> I<00:05:45.590> have

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:45.770 
you obviously it wasn't the Katie I have

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:47.980 
you obviously it wasn't the Katie I have
a<00:05:45.800> good-enough<00:05:46.039> KD<00:05:46.430> it<00:05:46.850> was<00:05:47.570> it<00:05:47.840> could<00:05:47.960> have

00:05:47.980 --> 00:05:47.990 
a good-enough KD it was it could have

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:49.300 
a good-enough KD it was it could have
been<00:05:48.110> a<00:05:48.169> combination<00:05:48.740> of<00:05:48.800> things<00:05:48.950> it<00:05:49.160> could

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:49.310 
been a combination of things it could

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:51.820 
been a combination of things it could
have<00:05:49.430> been<00:05:49.870> getting<00:05:50.870> the<00:05:51.080> kill<00:05:51.260> requirement

00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:51.830 
have been getting the kill requirement

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:53.620 
have been getting the kill requirement
which<00:05:51.979> I<00:05:52.220> think<00:05:52.639> it<00:05:52.760> probably<00:05:52.910> was<00:05:53.240> because<00:05:53.539> I

00:05:53.620 --> 00:05:53.630 
which I think it probably was because I

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:55.690 
which I think it probably was because I
was<00:05:53.750> I'm<00:05:54.139> pretty<00:05:54.200> close<00:05:54.500> to<00:05:54.710> 20,000<00:05:55.310> kills<00:05:55.520> now

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:55.700 
was I'm pretty close to 20,000 kills now

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:57.100 
was I'm pretty close to 20,000 kills now
that's<00:05:55.940> usually<00:05:56.210> around<00:05:56.330> when<00:05:56.660> I<00:05:56.750> get<00:05:56.810> them

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:57.110 
that's usually around when I get them

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:58.750 
that's usually around when I get them
all<00:05:57.440> so<00:05:57.919> you<00:05:57.979> know<00:05:58.190> it<00:05:58.310> could<00:05:58.460> have<00:05:58.550> been<00:05:58.669> the

00:05:58.750 --> 00:05:58.760 
all so you know it could have been the

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:00.580 
all so you know it could have been the
high<00:05:58.880> round<00:05:59.150> on<00:05:59.300> origins<00:05:59.780> you<00:05:59.900> don't<00:06:00.110> know<00:06:00.260> but

00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:00.590 
high round on origins you don't know but

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:05.529 
high round on origins you don't know but
um<00:06:00.910> so<00:06:01.910> I<00:06:01.940> did<00:06:02.210> get<00:06:02.300> shotguns<00:06:02.900> and<00:06:03.580> so<00:06:04.580> you<00:06:05.419> know

00:06:05.529 --> 00:06:05.539
