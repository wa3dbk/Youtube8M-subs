allows you to do is actually draw your

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.280 
allows you to do is actually draw your
passcode<00:00:09.179> so<00:00:09.450> you<00:00:09.510> can<00:00:09.660> see<00:00:09.809> right<00:00:09.840> here<00:00:10.110> if<00:00:10.200> I

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
passcode so you can see right here if I

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.339 
passcode so you can see right here if I
go<00:00:10.440> to<00:00:10.500> the<00:00:10.650> lock<00:00:10.830> screen<00:00:11.010> and<00:00:11.370> we<00:00:12.360> swipe<00:00:12.780> you

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:13.349 
go to the lock screen and we swipe you

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:15.169 
go to the lock screen and we swipe you
can<00:00:13.500> see<00:00:13.679> it<00:00:13.769> says<00:00:13.950> draw<00:00:14.250> your<00:00:14.460> passcode<00:00:14.940> so

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
can see it says draw your passcode so

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:17.210 
can see it says draw your passcode so
all<00:00:15.450> you<00:00:15.719> need<00:00:15.870> to<00:00:15.960> do<00:00:16.049> draw<00:00:16.590> your<00:00:16.619> passcode

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:17.220 
all you need to do draw your passcode

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.310 
all you need to do draw your passcode
and<00:00:17.430> it<00:00:18.029> automatically<00:00:18.539> unlocks<00:00:18.930> like<00:00:19.140> that

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:19.320 
and it automatically unlocks like that

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.200 
and it automatically unlocks like that
has<00:00:19.560> that<00:00:19.740> nice<00:00:19.949> little<00:00:20.220> animation<00:00:20.910> as<00:00:21.029> well

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:21.210 
has that nice little animation as well

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.929 
has that nice little animation as well
where<00:00:21.720> the<00:00:21.900> drawing<00:00:22.800> actually<00:00:23.279> expands

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
where the drawing actually expands

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:25.939 
where the drawing actually expands
outward<00:00:24.330> now<00:00:24.840> this<00:00:25.050> works<00:00:25.320> best<00:00:25.590> when<00:00:25.830> you

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
outward now this works best when you

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:27.920 
outward now this works best when you
have<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.310> same<00:00:26.609> wallpaper<00:00:27.180> as<00:00:27.720> your

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:27.930 
have the same wallpaper as your

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.660 
have the same wallpaper as your
lockscreen<00:00:28.320> wallpaper<00:00:28.650> and<00:00:29.340> your

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:29.670 
lockscreen wallpaper and your

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.099 
lockscreen wallpaper and your
springboard<00:00:30.029> wallpaper<00:00:30.480> just<00:00:30.750> because<00:00:30.990> it

00:00:31.099 --> 00:00:31.109 
springboard wallpaper just because it

00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.139 
springboard wallpaper just because it
looks<00:00:31.289> a<00:00:31.349> little<00:00:31.500> funky<00:00:31.890> if<00:00:32.070> it<00:00:32.520> expands<00:00:32.940> and

00:00:33.139 --> 00:00:33.149 
looks a little funky if it expands and

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:35.240 
looks a little funky if it expands and
then<00:00:33.270> changes<00:00:33.719> directly<00:00:34.260> to<00:00:34.530> a<00:00:34.559> different

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
then changes directly to a different

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.400 
then changes directly to a different
wallpaper<00:00:35.910> but<00:00:36.270> you<00:00:36.420> can<00:00:36.570> see<00:00:36.719> exactly<00:00:37.020> what

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:37.410 
wallpaper but you can see exactly what

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.650 
wallpaper but you can see exactly what
this<00:00:37.530> does<00:00:37.800> just<00:00:38.610> like<00:00:38.790> that<00:00:39.000> automatically

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
this does just like that automatically

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:41.959 
this does just like that automatically

all<00:00:42.149> you<00:00:42.239> need<00:00:42.390> to<00:00:42.450> do<00:00:42.570> is<00:00:42.780> go<00:00:43.260> down<00:00:43.440> here<00:00:43.770> to

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
all you need to do is go down here to

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.100 
all you need to do is go down here to
stride<00:00:44.460> and<00:00:44.730> then<00:00:45.329> make<00:00:45.510> sure<00:00:45.629> that<00:00:45.809> it<00:00:45.899> is

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:46.110 
stride and then make sure that it is

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.720 
stride and then make sure that it is
enabled<00:00:46.379> and<00:00:46.710> then<00:00:46.829> right<00:00:47.010> here<00:00:47.039> you<00:00:47.250> can<00:00:47.489> show

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730 
enabled and then right here you can show

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.459 
enabled and then right here you can show
green<00:00:48.239> highlight<00:00:48.780> if<00:00:48.989> you<00:00:49.079> want<00:00:49.260> to<00:00:49.350> do<00:00:49.440> that

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
green highlight if you want to do that

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.170 
green highlight if you want to do that
and<00:00:49.770> I'll<00:00:49.829> show<00:00:49.950> you<00:00:50.010> what<00:00:50.129> that<00:00:50.190> does<00:00:50.579> but

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
and I'll show you what that does but

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:52.430 
and I'll show you what that does but
right<00:00:51.420> down<00:00:51.570> here<00:00:51.719> at<00:00:51.809> the<00:00:51.870> bottom<00:00:51.930> is<00:00:52.289> where

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
right down here at the bottom is where

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.170 
right down here at the bottom is where
you're<00:00:52.559> going<00:00:52.680> to<00:00:52.739> change<00:00:53.010> your<00:00:53.129> password<00:00:53.340> so

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:54.180 
you're going to change your password so

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:55.520 
you're going to change your password so
it's<00:00:54.449> really<00:00:54.629> pretty<00:00:54.840> simple<00:00:54.960> you<00:00:55.289> have<00:00:55.379> a

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530 
it's really pretty simple you have a

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.619 
it's really pretty simple you have a
record<00:00:56.070> and<00:00:56.280> you<00:00:56.730> have<00:00:56.879> an<00:00:57.030> options<00:00:57.420> button

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629 
record and you have an options button

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.599 
record and you have an options button
right<00:00:57.840> here<00:00:57.870> so<00:00:58.530> the<00:00:58.710> record<00:00:59.070> obviously<00:00:59.219> you

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
right here so the record obviously you

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.459 
right here so the record obviously you
just<00:00:59.820> tap<00:01:00.000> record<00:01:00.180> and<00:01:00.539> then<00:01:00.600> you<00:01:00.750> put<00:01:00.989> in<00:01:01.140> your

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
just tap record and then you put in your

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.770 
just tap record and then you put in your
passcode<00:01:02.340> three<00:01:02.760> times<00:01:03.030> and<00:01:03.329> then<00:01:03.480> save<00:01:03.750> it

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
passcode three times and then save it

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.600 
passcode three times and then save it
and<00:01:04.049> that's<00:01:04.500> what<00:01:04.769> your<00:01:04.920> passcode<00:01:05.309> is<00:01:05.369> going

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
and that's what your passcode is going

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.550 
and that's what your passcode is going
to<00:01:05.700> be<00:01:05.850> right<00:01:06.420> here<00:01:06.630> we<00:01:06.750> have<00:01:06.780> options<00:01:07.380> you

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
to be right here we have options you

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.710 
to be right here we have options you
have<00:01:07.590> a<00:01:07.770> recognition<00:01:08.310> strictness<00:01:08.939> so<00:01:09.479> it<00:01:09.600> can

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
have a recognition strictness so it can

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:11.719 
have a recognition strictness so it can
be<00:01:09.810> low<00:01:10.049> medium<00:01:10.470> high<00:01:10.680> or<00:01:11.159> very<00:01:11.189> high<00:01:11.549> i

00:01:11.719 --> 00:01:11.729 
be low medium high or very high i

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:13.490 
be low medium high or very high i
recommend<00:01:12.330> putting<00:01:12.479> it<00:01:12.659> on<00:01:12.750> very<00:01:12.930> high<00:01:13.200> just

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:13.500 
recommend putting it on very high just

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.249 
recommend putting it on very high just
because<00:01:13.880> you<00:01:14.880> want<00:01:15.180> your<00:01:15.240> passcode<00:01:15.840> to<00:01:15.900> be

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
because you want your passcode to be

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.620 
because you want your passcode to be
hard<00:01:16.799> to<00:01:16.979> guess<00:01:17.220> so<00:01:17.580> that's<00:01:18.060> what<00:01:18.240> I<00:01:18.270> leave<00:01:18.509> it

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630 
hard to guess so that's what I leave it

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.600 
hard to guess so that's what I leave it
as<00:01:18.720> is<00:01:18.930> very<00:01:19.380> high<00:01:19.619> and<00:01:19.650> it<00:01:19.890> still<00:01:20.130> gives<00:01:20.460> you

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:20.610 
as is very high and it still gives you

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.120 
as is very high and it still gives you
some<00:01:20.869> movability<00:01:21.869> I<00:01:22.110> mean<00:01:22.439> it's<00:01:22.650> not<00:01:22.830> it's

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
some movability I mean it's not it's

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.010 
some movability I mean it's not it's
pretty<00:01:23.400> lenient<00:01:23.670> you're<00:01:24.270> still<00:01:24.509> not<00:01:24.540> going<00:01:24.840> to

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020 
pretty lenient you're still not going to

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.990 
pretty lenient you're still not going to
have<00:01:25.350> to<00:01:25.500> do<00:01:25.619> it<00:01:25.740> exactly<00:01:25.860> every<00:01:26.520> single<00:01:26.790> time

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
have to do it exactly every single time

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.700 
have to do it exactly every single time
but<00:01:27.509> right<00:01:27.659> here<00:01:27.840> if<00:01:27.960> we<00:01:28.080> start<00:01:28.290> to<00:01:28.380> record

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:28.710 
but right here if we start to record

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:29.690 
but right here if we start to record

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:29.700 
let's just say we're going to do a

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.120 
let's just say we're going to do a
circle<00:01:30.180> you<00:01:30.930> can<00:01:31.110> see<00:01:31.380> you<00:01:31.680> do<00:01:31.770> it<00:01:31.829> three<00:01:32.100> times

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
circle you can see you do it three times

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.600 
circle you can see you do it three times
and<00:01:32.960> it's<00:01:33.960> automatically<00:01:34.439> good<00:01:35.070> to<00:01:35.189> go<00:01:35.340> just

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
and it's automatically good to go just

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.399 
and it's automatically good to go just
tap<00:01:35.850> save<00:01:36.150> and<00:01:36.420> then<00:01:36.689> we<00:01:36.900> go<00:01:37.020> to<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.229> lock

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
does that green highlight and then

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.230 
does that green highlight and then
automatically<00:01:43.350> unlocks<00:01:43.829> just<00:01:44.159> like<00:01:44.310> that<00:01:44.579> so
