00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
she is always laying eggs so I have a

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:37.540 
she is always laying eggs so I have a
lot<00:02:36.890> in<00:02:37.070> here

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.550 
lot in here

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:39.520 
lot in here
now<00:02:38.420> the<00:02:38.480> one<00:02:38.690> thing<00:02:38.810> that<00:02:39.020> I'm<00:02:39.140> not<00:02:39.320> too

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
now the one thing that I'm not too

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.050 
now the one thing that I'm not too
excited<00:02:39.680> about<00:02:40.190> is<00:02:40.370> that<00:02:40.550> I<00:02:40.580> actually<00:02:40.820> have

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
excited about is that I actually have

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:44.800 
excited about is that I actually have
them<00:02:41.510> inside<00:02:41.810> with<00:02:41.959> the<00:02:42.050> gravel<00:02:42.500> I<00:02:43.780> kind<00:02:44.780> of

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:44.810 
them inside with the gravel I kind of

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:46.270 
them inside with the gravel I kind of
regret<00:02:44.959> it<00:02:45.140> but<00:02:45.290> it's<00:02:45.440> too<00:02:45.590> late<00:02:45.770> now<00:02:45.830> so<00:02:46.220> it

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:46.280 
regret it but it's too late now so it

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:47.500 
regret it but it's too late now so it
doesn't<00:02:46.310> really<00:02:46.550> matter<00:02:46.850> so<00:02:47.090> what<00:02:47.330> I'm<00:02:47.420> gonna

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:50.120 
run out of green water you can make your

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:51.550 
run out of green water you can make your
own<00:04:50.150> green<00:04:50.450> water<00:04:50.660> you<00:04:50.840> can<00:04:50.960> possibly<00:04:51.290> put<00:04:51.500> a

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:51.560 
own green water you can possibly put a

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:54.340 
own green water you can possibly put a
bottle<00:04:51.950> of<00:04:52.010> water<00:04:52.280> dechlorinated<00:04:53.180> and<00:04:53.389> put<00:04:54.230> it

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:54.350 
bottle of water dechlorinated and put it

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:56.230 
bottle of water dechlorinated and put it
like<00:04:54.530> a<00:04:54.560> two-liter<00:04:54.950> pop<00:04:55.010> bottle<00:04:55.520> right<00:04:56.090> in

00:04:56.230 --> 00:04:56.240 
like a two-liter pop bottle right in

00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.420 
like a two-liter pop bottle right in
your<00:04:56.330> window<00:04:56.690> seal<00:04:56.930> and<00:04:57.800> create<00:04:58.160> your<00:04:58.280> own

00:04:58.420 --> 00:04:58.430 
your window seal and create your own

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:01.090 
your window seal and create your own
green<00:04:58.790> water<00:04:59.470> because<00:05:00.470> the<00:05:00.560> water<00:05:00.740> will<00:05:00.889> turn

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:01.100 
green water because the water will turn

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:03.640 
green water because the water will turn
green<00:05:01.400> from<00:05:01.669> the<00:05:01.760> algae<00:05:02.290> so<00:05:03.290> I<00:05:03.320> think<00:05:03.530> that's

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:03.650 
green from the algae so I think that's

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:05.770 
green from the algae so I think that's
another<00:05:03.830> good<00:05:04.010> idea<00:05:04.240> so<00:05:05.240> that's<00:05:05.360> it<00:05:05.570> I<00:05:05.720> just

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:05.780 
another good idea so that's it I just

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:07.450 
another good idea so that's it I just
want<00:05:06.110> to<00:05:06.169> share<00:05:06.290> with<00:05:06.440> you<00:05:06.530> guys<00:05:06.560> all<00:05:07.010> muscle
