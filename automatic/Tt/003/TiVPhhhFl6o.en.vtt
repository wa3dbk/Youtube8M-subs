00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:02.619 
hitting him beet pulp and and trying to

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:04.679 
hitting him beet pulp and and trying to
get<00:02:02.740> body<00:02:02.979> at<00:02:03.159> a<00:02:03.219> young<00:02:03.399> age<00:02:03.640> I<00:02:04.000> probably

00:02:04.679 --> 00:02:04.689 
get body at a young age I probably

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:06.419 
get body at a young age I probably
wouldn't<00:02:04.990> do<00:02:05.170> that<00:02:05.200> if<00:02:05.530> I<00:02:05.619> were<00:02:05.740> him

00:02:06.419 --> 00:02:06.429 
wouldn't do that if I were him

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:08.940 
wouldn't do that if I were him
just<00:02:06.939> put<00:02:07.090> that<00:02:07.210> hog<00:02:07.390> on<00:02:07.539> a<00:02:07.570> good<00:02:07.810> feed<00:02:08.110> like

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:08.950 
just put that hog on a good feed like

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:10.230 
just put that hog on a good feed like
the<00:02:09.070> honor<00:02:09.190> program<00:02:09.580> that<00:02:09.730> we<00:02:09.790> do<00:02:09.880> have<00:02:10.060> or

00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:10.240 
the honor program that we do have or

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.370 
the honor program that we do have or
what<00:02:10.330> he's<00:02:10.420> feeding<00:02:10.630> you<00:02:10.780> know<00:02:10.930> an<00:02:11.020> 18%

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:11.380 
what he's feeding you know an 18%

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:13.470 
what he's feeding you know an 18%
protein<00:02:11.650> or<00:02:12.040> something<00:02:12.070> like<00:02:12.400> that

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:13.480 
protein or something like that

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.140 
protein or something like that
with<00:02:13.569> a<00:02:13.629> proper<00:02:13.930> fat<00:02:14.440> in<00:02:14.560> that<00:02:14.680> diet<00:02:15.150> because

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:16.150 
with a proper fat in that diet because

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.030 
with a proper fat in that diet because
by<00:02:16.269> adding<00:02:17.140> those<00:02:17.379> other<00:02:17.560> ingredients<00:02:17.739> have

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:18.040 
by adding those other ingredients have

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.110 
by adding those other ingredients have
that<00:02:18.159> young<00:02:18.310> of<00:02:18.400> age<00:02:18.549> that<00:02:18.849> really<00:02:19.060> the

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:19.120 
that young of age that really the

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.520 
that young of age that really the
animal's<00:02:19.569> stomach<00:02:19.659> isn't<00:02:20.110> quite<00:02:20.230> ready<00:02:20.379> for

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:20.530 
animal's stomach isn't quite ready for

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.110 
animal's stomach isn't quite ready for
that<00:02:20.709> at<00:02:20.860> that<00:02:20.980> age<00:02:21.010> and<00:02:21.700> it's<00:02:21.879> just<00:02:22.030> really

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
that at that age and it's just really

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.000 
that at that age and it's just really
kind<00:02:22.330> of<00:02:22.360> feeding<00:02:22.659> the<00:02:22.810> purpose<00:02:23.170> like<00:02:23.739> Kevin

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:24.010 
kind of feeding the purpose like Kevin

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:25.350 
kind of feeding the purpose like Kevin
said<00:02:24.220> they<00:02:24.310> got<00:02:24.430> to<00:02:24.519> be<00:02:24.580> naturally<00:02:24.940> rib<00:02:25.150> to

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:25.360 
said they got to be naturally rib to

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:27.360 
said they got to be naturally rib to
begin<00:02:25.599> with<00:02:25.810> that<00:02:26.739> you'll<00:02:26.890> see<00:02:27.069> more<00:02:27.250> results

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:27.370 
begin with that you'll see more results

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:28.979 
begin with that you'll see more results
when<00:02:27.760> that<00:02:27.909> hog<00:02:28.120> gets<00:02:28.330> the<00:02:28.450> ultimate<00:02:28.540> weight

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:28.989 
when that hog gets the ultimate weight

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:30.660 
when that hog gets the ultimate weight
and<00:02:29.470> they're<00:02:29.590> more<00:02:29.739> mature<00:02:29.830> to<00:02:30.310> develop

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
and they're more mature to develop

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.400 
and they're more mature to develop
they'll<00:02:31.060> expand<00:02:31.390> that<00:02:31.569> really<00:02:31.810> even<00:02:31.900> more<00:02:32.200> to

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:32.410 
they'll expand that really even more to

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:33.720 
they'll expand that really even more to
heavier<00:02:32.680> weight<00:02:32.860> so<00:02:33.040> I'd<00:02:33.129> add<00:02:33.310> those<00:02:33.549> other

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730 
heavier weight so I'd add those other

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.820 
heavier weight so I'd add those other
products<00:02:34.239> that<00:02:34.390> we're<00:02:34.660> talking<00:02:34.989> about<00:02:35.140> later

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:35.830 
products that we're talking about later

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:37.619 
products that we're talking about later
in<00:02:35.980> the<00:02:36.069> Hogs<00:02:36.280> what<00:02:36.519> life<00:02:36.760> then<00:02:37.000> so<00:02:37.030> early<00:02:37.480> a

00:02:37.619 --> 00:02:37.629 
in the Hogs what life then so early a

00:02:37.629 --> 00:02:40.260 
in the Hogs what life then so early a
little<00:02:38.110> bit
