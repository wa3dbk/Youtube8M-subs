minutes<00:03:07.209> we've<00:03:07.389> leveled<00:03:07.630> the<00:03:07.750> game<00:03:07.930> but<00:03:08.139> off

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.350 
minutes we've leveled the game but off

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:10.680 
minutes we've leveled the game but off
the<00:03:08.380> back<00:03:08.650> of<00:03:08.680> that<00:03:08.829> goal<00:03:09.100> and<00:03:09.310> I<00:03:10.120> decided<00:03:10.569> to

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:10.690 
the back of that goal and I decided to

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:12.210 
the back of that goal and I decided to
push<00:03:10.870> on<00:03:11.019> a<00:03:11.079> little<00:03:11.170> bit<00:03:11.470> further<00:03:11.650> I<00:03:11.829> decided

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:12.220 
push on a little bit further I decided

00:03:12.220 --> 00:03:14.220 
push on a little bit further I decided
to<00:03:12.370> continue<00:03:12.519> my<00:03:12.910> offensive<00:03:13.569> movement<00:03:14.049> and

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:14.230 
to continue my offensive movement and

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:15.599 
to continue my offensive movement and
there's<00:03:14.620> a<00:03:14.709> rat<00:03:14.950> it<00:03:15.160> comes<00:03:15.340> down<00:03:15.459> the

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:15.609 
there's a rat it comes down the

00:03:15.609 --> 00:03:17.789 
there's a rat it comes down the
left-hand<00:03:15.940> side<00:03:16.000> and<00:03:16.299> he<00:03:16.900> cuts<00:03:17.109> inside<00:03:17.290> around

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:17.799 
left-hand side and he cuts inside around

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:19.020 
left-hand side and he cuts inside around
Boateng<00:03:18.160> I<00:03:18.250> thought<00:03:18.430> I<00:03:18.459> should<00:03:18.579> had<00:03:18.790> another

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:19.030 
Boateng I thought I should had another

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:20.490 
Boateng I thought I should had another
penalty<00:03:19.329> there<00:03:19.569> but<00:03:19.780> then<00:03:19.900> I<00:03:19.930> realized<00:03:20.290> it<00:03:20.410> was

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
penalty there but then I realized it was

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:22.199 
penalty there but then I realized it was
actually<00:03:20.620> quite<00:03:20.859> a<00:03:20.950> decent<00:03:21.160> tackle<00:03:21.609> and<00:03:21.760> there

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:22.209 
actually quite a decent tackle and there

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:23.789 
actually quite a decent tackle and there
the<00:03:22.329> ball<00:03:22.480> falls<00:03:22.720> to<00:03:22.930> Bianchi<00:03:23.350> who<00:03:23.470> plays<00:03:23.650> it

00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:23.799 
the ball falls to Bianchi who plays it

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:25.559

one and but I was serious he didn't

00:04:42.110 --> 00:04:43.570 
one and but I was serious he didn't
enter<00:04:42.350> my<00:04:42.380> half<00:04:42.650> at<00:04:42.830> all<00:04:42.980> he<00:04:43.160> didn't<00:04:43.400> have<00:04:43.460> a

00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:43.580 
enter my half at all he didn't have a

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:45.220 
enter my half at all he didn't have a
shot<00:04:43.820> he<00:04:44.000> had<00:04:44.090> nothing<00:04:44.270> near<00:04:44.630> a<00:04:44.660> shot<00:04:44.990> he<00:04:45.140> had

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:45.230 
shot he had nothing near a shot he had

00:04:45.230 --> 00:04:46.360 
shot he had nothing near a shot he had
nothing<00:04:45.500> that<00:04:45.530> even<00:04:45.650> resembled<00:04:46.280> the

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:46.370 
nothing that even resembled the

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:48.430 
nothing that even resembled the
possibility<00:04:46.910> of<00:04:46.940> getting<00:04:47.210> a<00:04:47.450> shot<00:04:47.660> it<00:04:47.900> was<00:04:48.290> me

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:48.440 
possibility of getting a shot it was me

00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:50.350 
possibility of getting a shot it was me
being<00:04:48.680> completely<00:04:49.340> dominant<00:04:49.850> and<00:04:50.060> Pepe

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:50.360 
being completely dominant and Pepe

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.420 
being completely dominant and Pepe
scored<00:04:50.690> that<00:04:50.840> penalty<00:04:51.230> and<00:04:51.410> I<00:04:51.980> thought

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:52.430 
scored that penalty and I thought

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:53.620 
scored that penalty and I thought
something<00:04:52.730> might<00:04:53.060> have<00:04:53.180> been<00:04:53.210> up<00:04:53.390> with<00:04:53.540> the

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:53.630 
something might have been up with the

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:54.730 
something might have been up with the
connection<00:04:54.080> in<00:04:54.170> this<00:04:54.320> game<00:04:54.530> because

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:54.740 
connection in this game because

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:56.860 
connection in this game because
afterwards<00:04:55.430> it<00:04:55.790> made<00:04:56.030> me<00:04:56.210> watch<00:04:56.330> the<00:04:56.540> replay<00:04:56.840> I

00:04:56.860 --> 00:04:56.870 
afterwards it made me watch the replay I

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:58.240 
afterwards it made me watch the replay I
was<00:04:57.080> hammering<00:04:57.350> away<00:04:57.470> at<00:04:57.560> the<00:04:57.740> X<00:04:57.890> button<00:04:57.950> and

00:04:58.240 --> 00:04:58.250 
was hammering away at the X button and

00:04:58.250 --> 00:04:59.530 
was hammering away at the X button and
it<00:04:58.340> didn't<00:04:58.580> do<00:04:58.640> anything<00:04:58.910> but<00:04:59.120> I<00:04:59.180> didn't<00:04:59.450> think

00:04:59.530 --> 00:04:59.540 
it didn't do anything but I didn't think

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:01.420 
it didn't do anything but I didn't think
anything<00:04:59.870> of<00:05:00.080> it<00:05:00.230> because<00:05:00.380> it<00:05:00.920> actually<00:05:01.160> made

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:01.430

00:05:59.920 --> 00:05:59.930 
apart from that I didn't really get much

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:01.720 
apart from that I didn't really get much
else<00:06:00.290> I<00:06:00.380> was<00:06:00.500> so<00:06:00.680> tempted<00:06:00.890> to<00:06:01.070> discard<00:06:01.580> the

00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:01.730 
else I was so tempted to discard the

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:03.490 
else I was so tempted to discard the
entire<00:06:01.970> pack<00:06:02.210> but<00:06:02.450> that<00:06:02.600> formation<00:06:02.960> modifier

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:03.500 
entire pack but that formation modifier

may<00:06:03.770> come<00:06:03.980> in<00:06:04.100> handy<00:06:04.130> you<00:06:04.400> probably<00:06:04.790> won't

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:05.760 
may come in handy you probably won't

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:07.730 
may come in handy you probably won't
but<00:06:06.210> the<00:06:06.330> squad<00:06:06.600> fitness<00:06:07.050> thing<00:06:07.230> is<00:06:07.440> quite

00:06:07.730 --> 00:06:07.740 
but the squad fitness thing is quite

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:09.650 
but the squad fitness thing is quite
handy<00:06:08.100> so<00:06:08.310> I'll<00:06:08.520> probably<00:06:08.820> end<00:06:09.120> up<00:06:09.240> using<00:06:09.420> that

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:09.660 
handy so I'll probably end up using that

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:12.200 
handy so I'll probably end up using that
um<00:06:09.930> yeah<00:06:10.740> I<00:06:10.860> was<00:06:11.280> really<00:06:11.310> disappointed<00:06:11.610> with

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:12.210 
um yeah I was really disappointed with

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:13.760 
um yeah I was really disappointed with
how<00:06:12.270> this<00:06:12.420> episode<00:06:12.810> went<00:06:13.020> because<00:06:13.260> I<00:06:13.320> lost<00:06:13.590> the

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:13.770 
how this episode went because I lost the

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:15.110 
how this episode went because I lost the
game<00:06:13.920> sort<00:06:14.130> of<00:06:14.190> five<00:06:14.340> at<00:06:14.490> the<00:06:14.520> back<00:06:14.580> guy<00:06:14.910> and<00:06:15.090> I

00:06:15.110 --> 00:06:15.120 
game sort of five at the back guy and I

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:16.430 
game sort of five at the back guy and I
thought<00:06:15.270> like<00:06:15.450> that's<00:06:15.690> fair<00:06:15.900> enough<00:06:15.930> because

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:16.440 
thought like that's fair enough because

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:18.140 
thought like that's fair enough because
I<00:06:16.710> don't<00:06:17.010> really<00:06:17.280> do<00:06:17.430> well<00:06:17.460> against<00:06:18.030> that

00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:18.150 
I don't really do well against that

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:20.120 
I don't really do well against that
formation<00:06:18.510> typically<00:06:19.140> anyway<00:06:19.470> but<00:06:19.710> to<00:06:19.920> lose<00:06:20.070> a

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:20.130 
formation typically anyway but to lose a

00:06:20.130 --> 00:06:21.950 
formation typically anyway but to lose a
game<00:06:20.520> that<00:06:20.760> I<00:06:20.820> made<00:06:21.060> a<00:06:21.090> guy<00:06:21.300> rage<00:06:21.540> quitting

00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:21.960 
game that I made a guy rage quitting

00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:23.480 
game that I made a guy rage quitting
when<00:06:22.110> he<00:06:22.230> didn't<00:06:22.470> even<00:06:22.620> get<00:06:22.800> into<00:06:22.920> my<00:06:23.100> half<00:06:23.280> for

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:23.490 
when he didn't even get into my half for

00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:25.730 
when he didn't even get into my half for
the<00:06:23.520> whole<00:06:23.640> game<00:06:23.880> like<00:06:24.690> that's<00:06:25.020> a<00:06:25.200> bitter<00:06:25.500> pill

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:25.740 
the whole game like that's a bitter pill

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:27.890 
the whole game like that's a bitter pill
