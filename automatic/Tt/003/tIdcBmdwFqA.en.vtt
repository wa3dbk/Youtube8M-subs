00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.150
 barbecue sauce 

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:13.559
 I do not know honestly why sausages 

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.190
 one is drawn here 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:16.350

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.210
 another piece of sausage attached on a fork 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.390
 and here's a country-style potato there 

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.920
 lying cook sticks out 350 grams of butter but 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.529
 basically standard packaging 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.510
 svetoedov still drink this whole thing 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.460
 will be Coke at all if honestly I 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.090
 I wanted to review any other 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.099
 drink 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.410
 but I forgot to buy a drink a 

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:36.570
 I was lying in the fridge at school 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.969
 and I do not like, but today I will drink everything 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:40.980
 this is good coke in general here and so 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:43.860
 It means that we have at the price sytoedov 

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:45.840
 about 150 rubles worth I exactly if 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.270
 honestly I donâ€™t remember well there plus minus a 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.010
 Coca-Cola and FIG knows how much it 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.000
 it is probably already two months in 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.270
 the refrigerator is lying around 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.940
 I don't remember it means this way 

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.260
 let's start with our sausages packaging 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.780
 frontal he showed 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:04.589
 so let's see the other side 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:07.439
 so here too, the cook is sitting so plov from 

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:09.810
 lamb and kebab drawn novelties 

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:12.240
 in the menu Satan 2 here is the composition of com 

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.220
 interest all type of natural bezier 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.670
 but basically there is nothing more to watch 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:26.390
 let's open our beauty ksu sausages 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:31.759
 Type German n5 aside box 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:31.759
 so cut off 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:39.759
 y and honestly here this sausage 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:41.920
 at first something that reminded me another 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:46.600
 I know if such a fantasy but as 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:48.220
 here guys are generally something bad in general 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.590
 okay let's see it but all 

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.720
 It looks like this but there's potatoes 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:58.210
 frozen sticks out in a rustic way 

00:01:52.720 --> 00:02:01.899
 like this, but sausage seems to be something 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:04.720
 it is not clear if honestly such a sausage 

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:07.270
 and that's where the tomato sauce is 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:09.459
 well then you go this case is heated in 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.950
 microwave as it warms up I'm to 

00:02:09.459 --> 00:02:14.440
 I'll be back well, my dear friends 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:18.280

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:20.200
 open so it opens sausages he 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.000
 I will say the smell example from this sausage goes 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:25.049
 very strong so straight saturated 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:28.000
 smell format such color sausage 

00:02:25.049 --> 00:02:31.209
 so but damn something like on the mind if 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:33.790
 honestly but you get the shorter penis 

00:02:31.209 --> 00:02:36.579
 resembles by sight not this sausage i don't 

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:39.850
 I know in general, honestly before buying 

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:41.980
 such a dish but she was a sausage was 

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:44.950
 less and here it is straight like this 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:47.139
 healthy straight so childish but you 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:49.889
 understood so let me cut off now 

00:02:47.139 --> 00:02:49.889

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:04.720
 everything is normal 

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:07.510
