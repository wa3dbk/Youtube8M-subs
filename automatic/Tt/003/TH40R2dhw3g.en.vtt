00:00:11.609 --> 00:00:16.169
 aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:21.589
 boredom 

00:00:21.589 --> 00:00:24.589
 good 

00:00:25.239 --> 00:00:28.439
 Hello 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.380
 the first car produced in the establishments of sant'agata bolognese. 

00:00:33.379 --> 00:00:35.400
 350 gt 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:36.250
 translator 

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:39.970
 roaring metal ferruccio lamborghini's ideas I called the very young 

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:43.989
 but already an expert he had already worked for alfa romeo for ferrari 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:46.230
 engineer giotto bizzarrini 

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:50.110
 these undoubtedly fascinated by the possibility of building an engine of 

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:51.589
 very high performance 

00:00:51.589 --> 00:00:55.200
 with a few direct directors, he set to work with enthusiasm 

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.170
 the only thing that the entrepreneur lamborghini immediately made clear was that 

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:03.480
 it would have been an engine dedicated to the &amp; gt e92 cars from 

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.440
 race 

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:05.670
 what will come out of it 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:06.720
 a true masterpiece 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.350
 in a relatively short time whimsical led to the engine to his 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.590
 first test at the counter 

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:15.490
 it was a 12-cylinder av with double overhead camshaft 

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.630
 it's a displacement of 3497 cubic centimeters 

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:23.440
 it was powered by 6 vertical weber racing carburetors 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:28.690
 with very strong diagrams it is a compression ratio of moves, 5 1 

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:31.690
 he managed to score a power of 360 falls 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.340
 Ferruccio Lamborghini was immediately very satisfied 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.420
 and arranged that this engine should be used to develop a version 

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:42.410
 more treatable - scorbutica that would have equipped its gt 

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:46.730
 to dress the first lamborghini was called a designer known only 

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:49.510
 from the experts to the ex-echelon group 

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:53.560
 the product turned out to be at least questionable das or forcibly 

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:54.560
 futuristic 

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.979
 this does not remove the fact that the 350 gtv disposed of first fruits not deprived of 

00:01:58.979 --> 00:01:59.880
 charm 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.259
 posterior omnimoto developed in height the decisive cut of the side 

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:06.080
 and the square tail 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.720
 unfortunately the front the most watched one was not really happy and this 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:12.439
 helps create everything 

00:02:12.439 --> 00:02:15.359
 les ita on the tail first license plate lamborghini 

00:02:15.359 --> 00:02:19.659
 his first outing at the Turin show for 63 or even the last one 

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:22.679
 ferruccio lamborghini reacted with the usual energy 

00:02:22.679 --> 00:02:26.610
 eliminated scaglione gave assignment to the prestigious touring body shop 

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:30.600
 that a few years earlier had made the magnificent body of the aston martin 

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.150
 db4 

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.340
 superlight system reawakens in painting with the same yesterday together 

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.670
 but thinking about linking to me more elegantly the changes concern the pace 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.629
 at the height of the chest increased that allowed to obtain a third place of 

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:45.350
 luck 

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.169
 behind the front seats 

00:02:47.169 --> 00:02:51.849
 the fresh water life mechanic with a 270 horsepower version but the big one 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:55.399
 difference with the most immediate one date from the line 

00:02:55.399 --> 00:02:59.779
 the touring body builds a chassis for the first standard Lamborghini 

00:02:59.779 --> 00:03:01.620
 noteworthy elegant 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:03.419
 and at the same time aggressive 

00:03:03.419 --> 00:03:08.510
 it was presented at the Geneva Motor Show on 64 but during the few months of production 

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:12.519
 there are 13 cars coming out of the establishment of sant'agata everything is 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:15.999
 sold at a lower price than what their cost had been 

00:03:15.999 --> 00:03:16.819
 lamborghini 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:18.229
 did not read off 

00:03:18.229 --> 00:03:21.659
 really industrial it was aware of the costs of the first years 

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:24.459
 and more than ever determined to achieve success 

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:28.889
 in '65 followed a 4-liter and 320-horsepower version 

00:03:28.889 --> 00:03:31.379
 and was welcomed with a big brother 

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:34.919
 there was also a gtz set up by zagato 

00:03:34.919 --> 00:03:36.229
 only two specimens 

00:03:36.229 --> 00:03:38.960
 is a spider version of touring always 

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:41.489
 then comes the 400 g 

00:03:41.489 --> 00:03:44.209
 the 400 gt of the presented them 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:45.779
 1966 

00:03:45.779 --> 00:03:49.799
 and represented the logical evolution of the 350 gt 

00:03:49.799 --> 00:03:52.739
 which in any case remained an introduction or burst 

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:56.389
 exposed at that year's geneva show the new lamborghini yes 

00:03:56.389 --> 00:04:00.329
 presented very similar to the previous model but if the engine of the last 

00:04:00.329 --> 00:04:05.499
 320 horsepower version had remained practically unchanged thus 

00:04:05.499 --> 00:04:07.549
 can not for many other components 

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:12.579
 primarily spicy change no longer zf but produced by the same lamborghini 

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:16.030
 as well as the differential that previously was marked a 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:16.769
 Salzburg 

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:21.159
 also the pure tank designed to have a more spacious trunk 

00:04:21.159 --> 00:04:24.620
 the anterior optic groups passed by the ovoid forms 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:27.590
 with 4 round headlights of smaller diameter 

00:04:27.590 --> 00:04:30.919
 however, they were the only noticeable aesthetic difference 

00:04:30.919 --> 00:04:33.979
 Lamborghini was finally satisfied with his product 

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:38.979
 and its cars with a declared speed of 270 kilometers per hour and even 

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:43.009
 well finished they had carved a place in the sun among the competitors of 

00:04:43.009 --> 00:04:44.270
 very high level 

00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:45.719
 but it was only the beginning 

00:04:45.719 --> 00:04:51.189
 already from 1965 on the sly one was working on a breathtaking project 

00:04:51.189 --> 00:04:54.460
 soon his name would have been on everyone's lips
