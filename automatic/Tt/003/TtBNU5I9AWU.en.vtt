00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.649
 secondary caris refers to a renewed 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.470
 karrees education at one already 

00:00:04.649 --> 00:00:09.660
 for example 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:12.900
 a protruding polished or 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:15.270
 damaged filling or crowns edge them 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.550
 old amalgam fillings see the part 

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:21.210
 The dark areas have broken out 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:23.699
 are secondary ks which is secondary caris 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.550
 to distinguish from caries initiative 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:29.460
 this signifies a renewed flare up 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:33.000
 a not completely removed caries 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:35.760
 at an already treated post 

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.690
 Career low is usually the result 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:41.640
 a dental medical treatment error 

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:43.680
 a badly made restoration 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.290
 as supernatant or too short 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:49.140
 crown edges incomplete fillings 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:51.210
 or too great to relax 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:53.880
 The car is produced one second 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.740
 unfortunately players but also in many 

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:58.230
 care habits of 

00:00:55.740 --> 00:01:01.350
 Patients play a decisive role in the 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.540
 emergence of the secondary kares you see 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.670
 a cunning pay with a crown 

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:07.670
 one recognizes a subtle fine 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:10.320
 dark stripes on the green edge of the 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.749
 patient believes that over reason 

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.399
 pay is not protected forever 

00:01:12.749 --> 00:01:17.159
 more like careful 

00:01:14.399 --> 00:01:19.950
 care needs like the rest of the teeth 

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:23.009
 that is a mistake it formed 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.840
 Secondary kares with the probe can under 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:27.420
 the crowns are probed 

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:31.439
 How deep does the comparison of them show you? 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:34.289
 probe length of this edge karrees form 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:36.780
 Secondary kds are often observed 

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:39.840
 at crown edges of the crowns edge is 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.389
 a particularly vulnerable area itself 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.819
 worried preparation of the dentures 

00:01:42.389 --> 00:01:47.639
 he always makes an interruption of the 

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:50.009
 continuous tooth surface since the 

00:01:47.639 --> 00:01:51.929
 both adequate and care 

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.859
 welcome hiding place for bacteria 

00:01:51.929 --> 00:01:55.439
 can be 

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:57.060
 it is particularly dangerous if the 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:59.850
 corresponding tooth already root 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.829
 is treated in this case becomes one 

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.749
 often do not cart it at all 

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:06.060
 perceived because they have no 

00:02:03.749 --> 00:02:08.610
 more pain causes the tooth 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.490
 literally decayed unnoticed underneath 

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.590
 the crown 

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:14.000
 a clear landmark should 

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.520
 bad taste in the mouth or 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.660
 to be bad breath is the cart is 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.160
 for now, that far 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.140
 that progressed 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.840
 ignite gums or bones 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:26.060
 and it is pain to be perceived 

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.600
 already too late the numbers are still up 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.970
 rescue 

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:32.480
 in many cases, only the 

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:35.180
 extraction all the more annoying if it is 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:37.490
 with the numbers around the support pillar one 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:40.070
 bridge or important consider paying for 

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:42.260
 then a prosthesis has acted 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:45.250
 is the new production of the whole 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:47.780
 Bridge or denture often inevitable 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.880
 so it does not even come to that 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:51.980
 can also be restored scenes 

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:52.580
 the usual care in the care 

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:54.350
 prevail 

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:56.330
 but above all, they do one 

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:58.310
 Regular check up with your dentist 

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:00.380
 because he already knows a caries 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:03.130
 recognize if they themselves nothing 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:03.130
 remember about it
