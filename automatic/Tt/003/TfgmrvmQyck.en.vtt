you're done downloading the SDK make

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.850 
you're done downloading the SDK make
sure<00:01:06.420> to<00:01:06.630> extract<00:01:07.229> it<00:01:07.409> by<00:01:07.560> just

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
sure to extract it by just

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.920 
sure to extract it by just
double-clicking<00:01:08.340> on<00:01:08.790> it<00:01:08.850> any<00:01:09.180> new<00:01:09.479> folder

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
double-clicking on it any new folder

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.399 
double-clicking on it any new folder
will<00:01:10.140> show<00:01:10.350> up<00:01:10.590> called<00:01:10.920> ADT<00:01:11.640> bundle<00:01:12.150> Mac<00:01:12.409> so

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:13.409 
will show up called ADT bundle Mac so

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:15.440 
will show up called ADT bundle Mac so
the<00:01:13.590> next<00:01:13.860> step<00:01:14.040> is<00:01:14.189> to<00:01:14.369> create<00:01:14.520> a<00:01:14.760> folder<00:01:15.270> and

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:15.450 
the next step is to create a folder and

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:17.240 
the next step is to create a folder and
we're<00:01:15.659> going<00:01:15.810> to<00:01:15.990> call<00:01:16.200> it<00:01:16.380> Android<00:01:16.830> and<00:01:17.009> put

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
we're going to call it Android and put

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.880 
we're going to call it Android and put
it<00:01:17.369> on<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.640> desktop<00:01:17.970> I<00:01:18.330> head<00:01:18.780> back<00:01:18.810> to<00:01:19.110> the<00:01:19.409> apt

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
it on the desktop I head back to the apt

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:22.010 
it on the desktop I head back to the apt
bundle<00:01:20.460> Mac<00:01:20.640> folder<00:01:21.090> and<00:01:21.299> inside<00:01:21.689> there<00:01:21.930> will

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
bundle Mac folder and inside there will

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.440 
bundle Mac folder and inside there will
be<00:01:22.049> another<00:01:22.439> folder<00:01:22.860> called<00:01:22.890> SDKs<00:01:23.759> so<00:01:24.060> open

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
be another folder called SDKs so open

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.120 
be another folder called SDKs so open
that<00:01:24.479> one<00:01:24.750> up<00:01:24.810> as<00:01:25.080> well<00:01:25.110> and<00:01:25.590> then<00:01:25.710> head<00:01:25.950> over

now<00:01:38.909> it's<00:01:39.150> time<00:01:39.299> to<00:01:39.479> test<00:01:39.750> out<00:01:40.049> a<00:01:40.320> DB<00:01:40.710> and<00:01:40.950> see

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
now it's time to test out a DB and see

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.640 
now it's time to test out a DB and see
if<00:01:41.520> it<00:01:41.700> works<00:01:41.939> so<00:01:42.240> on<00:01:43.080> your<00:01:43.229> Android<00:01:43.619> device
