also i did use my way control spray by
this<00:03:30.540> unit<00:03:30.959> and<00:03:33.110> because<00:03:34.110> she<00:03:34.709> was<00:03:34.890> getting<00:03:35.220> a

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:35.250 
this unit and because she was getting a

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:36.710 
this unit and because she was getting a
little<00:03:35.370> on<00:03:35.549> the<00:03:35.579> frizzy<00:03:35.849> side<00:03:36.150> but<00:03:36.480> that

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:36.720 
little on the frizzy side but that

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.699 
little on the frizzy side but that
definitely<00:03:37.049> took<00:03:37.890> care<00:03:38.129> of<00:03:38.159> the<00:03:38.390> issue<00:03:39.709> so

00:03:40.699 --> 00:03:40.709 
definitely took care of the issue so

00:03:40.709 --> 00:03:43.789 
definitely took care of the issue so
it's<00:03:41.459> gotten<00:03:41.700> hair<00:03:41.819> under<00:03:42.000> control<00:03:42.359> I<00:03:43.349> think

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:43.799 
it's gotten hair under control I think

00:03:43.799 --> 00:03:45.800

she<00:03:43.950> can<00:03:44.129> get<00:03:44.340> big<00:03:44.640> if<00:03:44.849> you<00:03:44.940> play<00:03:45.150> with<00:03:45.329> her<00:03:45.510> you

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:45.810 
she can get big if you play with her you

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:47.360 
she can get big if you play with her you
like<00:03:46.019> like<00:03:46.290> super<00:03:46.470> big<00:03:46.739> hair<00:03:46.920> she<00:03:47.159> could<00:03:47.280> get
