00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:57.940 
definitely added safety benefits I feel

00:03:57.940 --> 00:03:59.879 
definitely added safety benefits I feel
like<00:03:58.030> also<00:03:58.359> you<00:03:58.540> get<00:03:58.780> a<00:03:58.840> wider<00:03:59.200> viewing<00:03:59.620> angle

00:03:59.879 --> 00:03:59.889 
like also you get a wider viewing angle

00:03:59.889 --> 00:04:05.220 
like also you get a wider viewing angle
with<00:04:00.250> these<00:04:00.400> lights<00:04:01.349> also<00:04:02.349> they<00:04:04.019> operate<00:04:05.019> at<00:04:05.200> a

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230 
with these lights also they operate at a

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:08.460 
with these lights also they operate at a
cooler<00:04:05.829> temperature<00:04:06.160> than<00:04:07.260> halogen<00:04:08.260> lights

cooler temperature than halogen lights

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:11.759 
cooler temperature than halogen lights
and<00:04:09.459> I<00:04:09.549> think<00:04:09.819> on<00:04:10.209> the<00:04:10.239> website<00:04:11.109> it<00:04:11.290> says<00:04:11.530> that

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:11.769 
and I think on the website it says that

00:04:11.769 --> 00:04:14.640 
and I think on the website it says that
it's<00:04:11.919> a<00:04:12.040> ten-time<00:04:12.849> lifespan<00:04:13.750> overstock

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:14.650 
it's a ten-time lifespan overstock

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:18.060 
it's a ten-time lifespan overstock
halogens<00:04:16.349> if<00:04:17.349> I<00:04:17.440> were<00:04:17.560> to<00:04:17.650> give<00:04:17.739> you<00:04:17.859> one

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070

halogens if I were to give you one
installation<00:04:18.400> tip<00:04:18.910> I<00:04:19.299> would<00:04:19.989> definitely

00:04:20.580 --> 00:04:20.590 
installation tip I would definitely

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:23.610 
installation tip I would definitely
recommend<00:04:21.419> not<00:04:22.419> touching<00:04:22.960> the<00:04:23.110> bulb<00:04:23.349> with

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:23.620 
recommend not touching the bulb with

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:25.850 
recommend not touching the bulb with
your<00:04:23.650> bare<00:04:23.950> hands

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:25.860 
your bare hands

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.800 
your bare hands
doesn't<00:04:26.189> go<00:04:26.310> just<00:04:26.669> for<00:04:26.789> hid<00:04:27.120> this<00:04:27.360> also<00:04:27.539> goes

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:27.810 
doesn't go just for hid this also goes

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:30.649 
doesn't go just for hid this also goes
for<00:04:27.840> regular<00:04:28.650> halogens<00:04:29.250> the<00:04:30.030> oils<00:04:30.389> from<00:04:30.569> your

00:04:30.649 --> 00:04:30.659 
for regular halogens the oils from your

00:04:30.659 --> 00:04:34.189 
for regular halogens the oils from your
fingers<00:04:30.810> will<00:04:31.439> actually<00:04:32.360> do<00:04:33.360> damage<00:04:33.659> to<00:04:34.050> the

00:04:34.189 --> 00:04:34.199 
fingers will actually do damage to the

00:04:34.199 --> 00:04:36.730 
fingers will actually do damage to the
glass<00:04:34.919> the<00:04:35.310> filament<00:04:35.759> so<00:04:36.419> I<00:04:36.479> would<00:04:36.599> recommend

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:36.740 
glass the filament so I would recommend

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:39.230 
glass the filament so I would recommend
not<00:04:37.740> touching<00:04:38.099> it<00:04:38.189> or<00:04:38.370> if<00:04:38.550> you<00:04:38.669> have<00:04:38.699> to<00:04:39.060> touch

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240 
not touching it or if you have to touch

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.420 
not touching it or if you have to touch
it<00:04:39.300> like<00:04:39.689> if<00:04:39.840> you're<00:04:39.960> getting<00:04:40.110> into<00:04:40.319> a<00:04:40.430> really

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:41.430 
it like if you're getting into a really

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:43.189 
it like if you're getting into a really
tight<00:04:41.699> situation<00:04:42.330> I<00:04:42.539> would<00:04:42.900> definitely

00:04:43.189 --> 00:04:43.199 
tight situation I would definitely

00:04:43.199 --> 00:04:45.830 
tight situation I would definitely
recommend<00:04:43.289> wearing<00:04:43.830> gloves<00:04:44.419> like<00:04:45.419> latex

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:45.840 
recommend wearing gloves like latex

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.110 
recommend wearing gloves like latex
