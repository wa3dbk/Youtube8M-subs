have to grind them with a dremel this is

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.190 
have to grind them with a dremel this is
an<00:01:09.720> original<00:01:10.530> one<00:01:10.770> you<00:01:11.729> can<00:01:11.880> see<00:01:12.060> that<00:01:12.330> the<00:01:12.960> tip

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
an original one you can see that the tip

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.749 
an original one you can see that the tip
of<00:01:13.409> this<00:01:13.619> fits<00:01:14.040> into<00:01:14.310> our<00:01:14.460> spring<00:01:14.970> pin<00:01:15.240> and

00:01:16.749 --> 00:01:16.759 
of this fits into our spring pin and

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:21.410 
of this fits into our spring pin and
that<00:01:17.759> helps<00:01:18.180> to<00:01:18.360> hold<00:01:18.630> this<00:01:18.930> Allen<00:01:19.710> bit<00:01:19.920> on<00:01:20.460> the

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
that helps to hold this Allen bit on the

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:23.540 
that helps to hold this Allen bit on the
spring<00:01:21.689> pin

spring pin

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:25.610 
spring pin
so<00:01:24.180> we're<00:01:24.540> going<00:01:24.630> to<00:01:24.690> take<00:01:24.840> this<00:01:25.080> island<00:01:25.470> bit

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:25.620 
so we're going to take this island bit

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:28.670 
so we're going to take this island bit
we're<00:01:26.460> going<00:01:26.610> to<00:01:26.900> cut<00:01:27.900> a<00:01:27.930> little<00:01:28.200> bit<00:01:28.350> off<00:01:28.650> the

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
we're going to cut a little bit off the

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.080 
we're going to cut a little bit off the
bottom<00:01:29.540> for<00:01:30.540> clearance<00:01:30.960> issues<00:01:31.410> and<00:01:32.090> we're

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:33.090 
bottom for clearance issues and we're

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:38.060 
bottom for clearance issues and we're
going<00:01:33.210> to<00:01:33.680> cut<00:01:34.680> away<00:01:34.890> at<00:01:35.250> this<00:01:36.890> rounded<00:01:37.890> edge

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070 
going to cut away at this rounded edge

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:43.910 
going to cut away at this rounded edge
here<00:01:38.490> and<00:01:38.960> make<00:01:39.960> it<00:01:39.990> flat<00:01:40.550> and<00:01:42.620> you'll<00:01:43.620> end<00:01:43.800> up

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
here and make it flat and you'll end up

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.270 
here and make it flat and you'll end up
with<00:01:43.980> something<00:01:44.490> like<00:01:44.580> this<00:01:45.890> the<00:01:46.890> reason<00:01:47.040> you

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:47.280 
with something like this the reason you

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:49.370 
with something like this the reason you
want<00:01:47.490> this<00:01:47.700> edge<00:01:47.940> flat<00:01:48.360> here<00:01:48.690> so<00:01:48.990> that<00:01:49.200> it

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
want this edge flat here so that it

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:52.700 
want this edge flat here so that it
doesn't<00:01:49.520> try<00:01:50.520> to<00:01:50.580> spread<00:01:51.210> open<00:01:51.690> your<00:01:52.350> spring

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
doesn't try to spread open your spring

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.820 
doesn't try to spread open your spring
pin<00:01:52.980> when<00:01:53.940> you're<00:01:54.120> pressing<00:01:55.280> this<00:01:56.540> into<00:01:57.540> the

screw in addition to the modified Allen
bit<00:02:35.190> here<00:02:35.660> you're<00:02:36.660> also<00:02:36.780> going<00:02:37.080> to<00:02:37.140> need<00:02:37.320> a<00:02:37.620> nun

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:38.130 
bit here you're also going to need a nun

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:40.930 
bit here you're also going to need a nun
an<00:02:38.280> unmodified<00:02:38.820> one<00:02:39.390> it's<00:02:40.200> a<00:02:40.350> quarter<00:02:40.709> inch

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:40.940 
an unmodified one it's a quarter inch

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:44.720 
an unmodified one it's a quarter inch
because<00:02:42.380> this<00:02:43.380> bit<00:02:43.709> when<00:02:44.340> you're<00:02:44.459> pressing

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
because this bit when you're pressing

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.300 
because this bit when you're pressing
the<00:02:44.940> spring<00:02:45.270> pin<00:02:45.480> out<00:02:45.739> will<00:02:46.739> eventually

the spring pin out will eventually

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:51.110 
the spring pin out will eventually
bottom<00:02:47.760> out<00:02:47.910> and<00:02:48.709> you'll<00:02:49.709> have<00:02:50.040> this<00:02:50.430> spring

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:51.120 
bottom out and you'll have this spring

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.880 
bottom out and you'll have this spring
pin<00:02:51.390> stuck<00:02:51.750> in<00:02:52.100> the<00:02:53.100> shift<00:02:53.340> rod<00:02:54.560> so<00:02:55.560> you'll

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
pin stuck in the shift rod so you'll

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:00.170 
pin stuck in the shift rod so you'll
need<00:02:56.040> the<00:02:56.310> unmodified<00:02:56.910> one<00:02:57.620> to<00:02:59.180> continue

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
need the unmodified one to continue

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.570 
need the unmodified one to continue
pressing<00:03:00.900> the<00:03:01.260> spring<00:03:01.470> pin<00:03:01.770> the<00:03:01.920> rest<00:03:02.250> of<00:03:02.520> the

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:02.580 
pressing the spring pin the rest of the

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:07.840 
pressing the spring pin the rest of the
way<00:03:02.700> out<00:03:02.730> and<00:03:03.590> it<00:03:04.590> helps<00:03:05.040> if<00:03:05.840> the<00:03:06.840> bit<00:03:07.050> you<00:03:07.260> use

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:07.850 
way out and it helps if the bit you use

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:10.080 
way out and it helps if the bit you use
has<00:03:08.850> a

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:10.090 
has a

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:14.520 
has a
a<00:03:11.280> divot<00:03:12.280> at<00:03:12.790> the<00:03:12.940> bottom<00:03:13.330> or<00:03:13.569> I<00:03:14.050> would

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
a divot at the bottom or I would

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:19.290 
a divot at the bottom or I would
actually<00:03:14.830> be<00:03:14.920> the<00:03:15.040> top<00:03:15.280> of<00:03:15.310> this<00:03:15.610> one<00:03:17.099> so<00:03:18.300> it

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:19.300 
actually be the top of this one so it

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:22.680 
actually be the top of this one so it
helps<00:03:19.750> to<00:03:19.810> prevent<00:03:20.349> the<00:03:20.790> bit<00:03:21.790> from<00:03:22.030> walking<00:03:22.540> on

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:22.690 
helps to prevent the bit from walking on

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:25.759 
helps to prevent the bit from walking on
the<00:03:22.930> screw<00:03:23.290> when<00:03:24.220> you've<00:03:24.340> got<00:03:24.519> that<00:03:24.790> done

the screw when you've got that done

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:30.180 
the screw when you've got that done
you're<00:03:26.769> going<00:03:26.890> to<00:03:26.950> take<00:03:27.220> your<00:03:28.290> 1<00:03:29.290> inch<00:03:29.500> nut<00:03:29.830> or

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:30.190 
you're going to take your 1 inch nut or

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:33.479 
you're going to take your 1 inch nut or
24<00:03:30.879> millimeter<00:03:31.360> nut<00:03:32.040> and<00:03:33.040> you're<00:03:33.280> going<00:03:33.400> to

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:33.489 
24 millimeter nut and you're going to

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:38.839 
24 millimeter nut and you're going to
grind<00:03:33.910> a<00:03:36.090> this<00:03:37.090> profile<00:03:37.629> until<00:03:37.959> around

00:03:38.839 --> 00:03:38.849 
grind a this profile until around

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:45.360 
grind a this profile until around
profile<00:03:40.170> that<00:03:41.170> fits<00:03:42.030> the<00:03:43.709> collar<00:03:44.709> of<00:03:45.190> the

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:45.370 
profile that fits the collar of the

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:49.140 
profile that fits the collar of the
shift<00:03:45.700> rod<00:03:46.319> and<00:03:47.319> it's<00:03:47.950> a<00:03:48.069> the<00:03:48.430> color<00:03:48.670> of<00:03:49.030> the

00:03:49.140 --> 00:03:49.150 
shift rod and it's a the color of the

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:52.020 
shift rod and it's a the color of the
shift<00:03:49.360> rod<00:03:49.680> has<00:03:50.680> about<00:03:51.010> a<00:03:51.040> 24<00:03:51.849> millimeter

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:52.030 
shift rod has about a 24 millimeter

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:57.420 
shift rod has about a 24 millimeter
diameter<00:03:53.849> so<00:03:54.849> that's<00:03:55.780> about<00:03:56.079> the<00:03:56.799> size<00:03:57.069> of

00:03:57.420 --> 00:03:57.430 
diameter so that's about the size of

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:04.170 
diameter so that's about the size of
this<00:03:59.160> cutout<00:04:00.160> that<00:04:00.489> you<00:04:00.640> want<00:04:00.819> to<00:04:00.879> make<00:04:03.180> so

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:04.180 
this cutout that you want to make so

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:07.309 
this cutout that you want to make so
this<00:04:04.780> is<00:04:04.900> basically<00:04:05.379> what<00:04:05.680> you<00:04:05.709> end<00:04:06.010> up<00:04:06.190> with

00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:07.319 
this is basically what you end up with

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:10.080 
this is basically what you end up with
this<00:04:08.319> is<00:04:08.530> outside<00:04:08.920> the<00:04:09.040> car<00:04:09.280> of<00:04:09.400> course<00:04:09.670> and

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.090 
this is outside the car of course and

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:13.110 
this is outside the car of course and
we're<00:04:10.180> missing<00:04:10.599> the<00:04:11.170> shift<00:04:11.470> rod<00:04:11.739> and<00:04:12.430> the

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:13.120 
we're missing the shift rod and the

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:15.479 
we're missing the shift rod and the
spring<00:04:13.390> pin<00:04:13.599> is<00:04:13.720> not<00:04:13.870> installed<00:04:14.290> either<00:04:14.500> but

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:15.489 
spring pin is not installed either but

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:18.599 
spring pin is not installed either but
this<00:04:15.970> gives<00:04:16.239> you<00:04:16.359> an<00:04:16.840> idea<00:04:17.079> of<00:04:17.709> how<00:04:18.400> these

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:18.609 
this gives you an idea of how these

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:22.950 
this gives you an idea of how these
pieces<00:04:18.940> go<00:04:19.180> together<00:04:21.300> at<00:04:22.300> the<00:04:22.450> top<00:04:22.690> we<00:04:22.930> have

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:22.960 
pieces go together at the top we have

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:27.270 
pieces go together at the top we have
our<00:04:23.229> bracket<00:04:24.870> the<00:04:25.870> bracket<00:04:26.349> is<00:04:26.860> there<00:04:27.070> because

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.280 
our bracket the bracket is there because

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:32.310 
our bracket the bracket is there because
the<00:04:27.669> nut<00:04:27.910> is<00:04:30.150> too<00:04:31.150> small<00:04:31.450> of<00:04:31.479> a<00:04:31.630> size<00:04:31.870> to<00:04:32.139> fit

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:32.320 
the nut is too small of a size to fit

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:35.129 
the nut is too small of a size to fit
this<00:04:32.500> puller<00:04:33.130> if<00:04:33.639> we<00:04:34.630> didn't<00:04:34.870> have<00:04:34.960> the

00:04:35.129 --> 00:04:35.139 
this puller if we didn't have the

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:38.490 
this puller if we didn't have the
bracket<00:04:35.650> the<00:04:35.860> nut<00:04:36.300> would<00:04:37.300> just<00:04:38.080> fall<00:04:38.470> right

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:38.500 
bracket the nut would just fall right

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:42.480 
bracket the nut would just fall right
out<00:04:40.110> it<00:04:41.110> would<00:04:41.260> slip<00:04:41.530> through<00:04:41.800> the<00:04:41.919> jaws<00:04:42.190> of

00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:42.490 
out it would slip through the jaws of

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:46.170 
out it would slip through the jaws of
our<00:04:42.610> puller<00:04:43.139> you<00:04:44.139> can<00:04:44.320> see<00:04:44.560> how<00:04:44.710> the<00:04:45.180> that

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:46.180 
our puller you can see how the that

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:48.810 
our puller you can see how the that
radius<00:04:46.660> that<00:04:46.960> we<00:04:47.050> cut<00:04:47.260> into<00:04:47.530> our<00:04:47.560> nut<00:04:47.860> fits

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:48.820 
radius that we cut into our nut fits

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:50.879 
radius that we cut into our nut fits
over<00:04:49.150> a<00:04:49.180> rounded<00:04:49.599> surface<00:04:50.050> it<00:04:50.560> would<00:04:50.710> actually

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:50.889 
over a rounded surface it would actually

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:56.580 
over a rounded surface it would actually
fit<00:04:51.250> over<00:04:51.520> the<00:04:51.789> shift<00:04:52.539> rod<00:04:52.750> collar<00:04:53.080> and<00:04:55.590> you

00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:56.590 
fit over the shift rod collar and you

00:04:56.590 --> 00:04:59.190 
fit over the shift rod collar and you
can<00:04:56.770> see<00:04:57.070> where<00:04:57.520> our<00:04:57.820> Allen<00:04:58.360> bit<00:04:58.539> goes<00:04:58.780> this<00:04:59.050> is

00:04:59.190 --> 00:04:59.200 
can see where our Allen bit goes this is

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:01.710 
can see where our Allen bit goes this is
the<00:04:59.289> unmodified<00:04:59.950> one<00:05:00.250> but<00:05:01.210> you<00:05:01.330> would<00:05:01.450> start

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:01.720 
the unmodified one but you would start

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:04.879 
the unmodified one but you would start
with<00:05:01.840> the<00:05:02.020> modified<00:05:02.500> one<00:05:02.530> first

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:04.889 
with the modified one first

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:09.709 
with the modified one first
and<00:05:05.659> you<00:05:06.659> can<00:05:06.840> see<00:05:07.080> that<00:05:07.729> if<00:05:08.729> we<00:05:08.789> turn<00:05:09.509> this

00:05:09.709 --> 00:05:09.719 
and you can see that if we turn this

00:05:09.719 --> 00:05:14.230 
and you can see that if we turn this
screw<00:05:10.110> in<00:05:10.370> to<00:05:11.370> it<00:05:11.490> force<00:05:11.849> the<00:05:12.659> Allen<00:05:12.990> bit<00:05:13.199> up

00:05:14.230 --> 00:05:14.240 
screw in to it force the Allen bit up

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:21.260 
screw in to it force the Allen bit up
into<00:05:15.240> the<00:05:16.430> spring<00:05:17.430> pin<00:05:17.639> and<00:05:18.349> press<00:05:19.349> it<00:05:19.590> out<00:05:20.270> so

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:21.270 
into the spring pin and press it out so

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:23.209 
into the spring pin and press it out so
hopefully<00:05:21.719> that's<00:05:21.900> enough<00:05:22.020> of<00:05:22.349> a<00:05:22.499> explanation

00:05:23.209 --> 00:05:23.219 
hopefully that's enough of a explanation

00:05:23.219 --> 00:05:25.610 
hopefully that's enough of a explanation
of<00:05:23.370> the<00:05:23.460> process<00:05:23.870> now<00:05:24.870> I'm<00:05:25.110> going<00:05:25.289> to<00:05:25.349> show<00:05:25.560> you

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:25.620 
of the process now I'm going to show you

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:29.989 
of the process now I'm going to show you
how<00:05:26.460> it's<00:05:26.639> actually<00:05:26.759> done<00:05:26.999> on<00:05:27.210> the<00:05:27.449> car<00:05:28.999> we're

00:05:29.989 --> 00:05:29.999 
how it's actually done on the car we're

00:05:29.999 --> 00:05:33.320 
how it's actually done on the car we're
going<00:05:30.120> to<00:05:30.180> pull<00:05:30.360> back<00:05:30.389> this<00:05:31.159> rubber<00:05:32.159> boot<00:05:32.460> to

going to pull back this rubber boot to

00:05:33.330 --> 00:05:37.459 
going to pull back this rubber boot to

00:05:37.459 --> 00:05:37.469 
expose a clip that's here that we have

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:40.590 
to remove and a spring pin that we need

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:51.700 
to remove and a spring pin that we need

clip is exposed and we should be able to
get<00:05:57.930> this<00:05:58.050> out<00:05:58.260> just<00:05:58.470> by<00:05:58.680> pulling<00:06:03.080> now<00:06:04.080> I'm

00:06:04.189 --> 00:06:04.199 
get this out just by pulling now I'm

00:06:04.199 --> 00:06:06.710 
get this out just by pulling now I'm
going<00:06:04.380> to<00:06:04.440> remove<00:06:04.560> this<00:06:04.830> shift<00:06:05.100> rod<00:06:05.340> it's<00:06:06.330> a<00:06:06.449> 12

going to remove this shift rod it's a 12

00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:08.750 
going to remove this shift rod it's a 12
millimeter<00:06:07.080> bolt<00:06:07.320> that'll<00:06:08.220> give<00:06:08.340> us<00:06:08.370> a<00:06:08.580> little

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:08.760 
millimeter bolt that'll give us a little

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:20.510 
millimeter bolt that'll give us a little
more<00:06:08.970> room<00:06:09.120> to<00:06:09.180> work<00:06:09.389> with<00:06:09.449> so<00:06:19.220> here<00:06:20.220> is<00:06:20.340> my

00:06:20.510 --> 00:06:20.520 
more room to work with so here is my

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:25.760 
more room to work with so here is my
setup<00:06:21.830> you<00:06:22.830> can<00:06:23.010> see<00:06:23.220> I<00:06:23.250> have<00:06:23.639> a<00:06:24.020> my<00:06:25.020> hinge<00:06:25.290> here

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:25.770 
setup you can see I have a my hinge here

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:29.990 
setup you can see I have a my hinge here
my<00:06:26.550> nut<00:06:26.790> on<00:06:26.910> top<00:06:26.940> and<00:06:28.010> my<00:06:29.010> modified<00:06:29.460> bit<00:06:29.790> right

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:30.000 
my nut on top and my modified bit right

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.730 
my nut on top and my modified bit right
here<00:06:30.330> and<00:06:30.830> my<00:06:31.830> puller<00:06:32.580> surrounding<00:06:33.240> it<00:06:33.330> all

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:33.740 
here and my puller surrounding it all

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:36.740 
here and my puller surrounding it all
and<00:06:34.740> that's<00:06:34.889> what<00:06:35.340> I'm<00:06:35.430> going<00:06:35.520> to<00:06:35.610> use<00:06:35.669> to<00:06:36.060> push

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:36.750 
and that's what I'm going to use to push

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:40.690 
and that's what I'm going to use to push
that<00:06:36.960> pin<00:06:37.260> up<00:06:37.530> and<00:06:38.240> into<00:06:39.240> the<00:06:39.360> nut<00:06:39.570> and

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:40.700 
that pin up and into the nut and

00:06:40.700 --> 00:07:03.520 
that pin up and into the nut and
eventually<00:06:41.700> out<00:06:41.940> of<00:06:42.150> the<00:06:42.300> shift<00:06:43.260> rod

00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:03.530 

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:06.290

00:07:06.290 --> 00:07:06.300 
so you can see that I've pressed the

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:09.050 
so you can see that I've pressed the
spring<00:07:06.930> pin<00:07:07.140> partially<00:07:07.860> out<00:07:08.010> using<00:07:08.730> my

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:09.060 
spring pin partially out using my

00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:11.840 
spring pin partially out using my
modified<00:07:09.600> bit<00:07:10.130> I'm<00:07:11.130> going<00:07:11.250> to<00:07:11.310> switch<00:07:11.550> over<00:07:11.700> to

00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:11.850 
modified bit I'm going to switch over to

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:14.120 
modified bit I'm going to switch over to
an<00:07:12.120> unmodified<00:07:12.510> bit<00:07:12.990> and<00:07:13.200> continue<00:07:13.860> pressing

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:14.130 
an unmodified bit and continue pressing

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:39.180 
an unmodified bit and continue pressing
the<00:07:15.000> spring<00:07:15.390> pin<00:07:15.660> out

00:07:39.180 --> 00:07:39.190
