somebody's been in the coded files of
the<00:00:31.230> game<00:00:31.410> as<00:00:31.619> well<00:00:31.830> and<00:00:32.070> plucked<00:00:32.669> out<00:00:32.880> a<00:00:32.910> few

different map names and little pieces of
information<00:00:36.149> as<00:00:36.600> well<00:00:36.870> so<00:00:37.320> we've<00:00:37.500> got<00:00:37.649> a<00:00:37.680> lot

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:37.800

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
to get through so this developer

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.090 
to get through so this developer

call of duty ghosts and so the names of

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.170 
call of duty ghosts and so the names of
these<00:00:48.539> are<00:00:48.840> swamp<00:00:49.289> battery<00:00:50.129> rumble<00:00:50.789> dome

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
these are swamp battery rumble dome

however<00:00:55.410> digging<00:00:55.770> into<00:00:55.890> some<00:00:56.129> of<00:00:56.250> the<00:00:56.309> code

00:00:56.540 --> 00:00:56.550 
however digging into some of the code

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.369 
however digging into some of the code
that<00:00:56.789> was<00:00:56.910> with<00:00:57.180> this<00:00:57.420> you<00:00:57.930> can<00:00:57.960> actually<00:00:58.199> see

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
that was with this you can actually see

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.439 
that was with this you can actually see
that<00:00:58.770> one<00:00:59.070> of<00:00:59.280> the<00:00:59.399> multiplayer<00:00:59.760> maps<00:01:00.059> was<00:01:00.270> not

00:01:00.439 --> 00:01:00.449 
that one of the multiplayer maps was not

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:01.819 
that one of the multiplayer maps was not
actually<00:01:00.539> shown<00:01:00.960> which<00:01:01.440> is<00:01:01.590> apparently

00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:01.829 
actually shown which is apparently

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:03.500 
actually shown which is apparently
called<00:01:02.190> descent<00:01:02.640> and<00:01:02.879> that<00:01:03.030> is<00:01:03.149> going<00:01:03.329> to<00:01:03.420> be

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
called descent and that is going to be

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.600 
called descent and that is going to be
coming<00:01:03.870> in<00:01:03.989> the<00:01:04.019> second<00:01:04.860> map<00:01:05.040> pack<00:01:05.280> for<00:01:05.489> call

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
coming in the second map pack for call

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:07.969 
coming in the second map pack for call
of<00:01:05.670> duty<00:01:05.970> ghosts<00:01:06.210> now<00:01:06.510> with<00:01:07.200> this<00:01:07.409> code<00:01:07.680> we<00:01:07.860> got

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
of duty ghosts now with this code we got

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.710 
of duty ghosts now with this code we got
the<00:01:08.100> list<00:01:08.280> of<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:08.610> other<00:01:08.820> names<00:01:09.119> which<00:01:09.360> we<00:01:09.540> saw

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:09.720 
the list of the other names which we saw

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.440 
the list of the other names which we saw
from<00:01:09.960> the<00:01:10.080> developers<00:01:10.700> actual<00:01:11.700> playlist<00:01:12.240> so

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:12.450 
from the developers actual playlist so

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:14.270 
from the developers actual playlist so
we<00:01:12.570> know<00:01:12.720> that<00:01:12.750> they<00:01:13.080> are<00:01:13.290> possibly<00:01:14.040> going<00:01:14.130> to

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
we know that they are possibly going to

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.740 
we know that they are possibly going to
be<00:01:14.369> in<00:01:14.430> the<00:01:14.520> game<00:01:14.670> possibly<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.150> code<00:01:15.420> names

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:15.750 
be in the game possibly the code names

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.230 
be in the game possibly the code names
and<00:01:16.020> four<00:01:16.710> for<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.430> maps<00:01:17.640> or<00:01:17.909> maybe<00:01:18.090> they

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240 
and four for the maps or maybe they

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.999 
and four for the maps or maybe they
already<00:01:18.450> are<00:01:18.780> in<00:01:18.810> the<00:01:19.110> game<00:01:19.290> but<00:01:19.619> those<00:01:19.799> map

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
already are in the game but those map

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:21.800 
already are in the game but those map
names<00:01:20.220> as<00:01:20.430> I<00:01:20.520> said<00:01:20.729> also<00:01:21.150> appeared<00:01:21.450> in<00:01:21.600> the

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
names as I said also appeared in the

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.270 
names as I said also appeared in the
code<00:01:22.049> for<00:01:22.259> the<00:01:22.350> game<00:01:22.530> that<00:01:22.560> wasn't<00:01:23.040> covered

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
code for the game that wasn't covered

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.090 
code for the game that wasn't covered
and<00:01:23.610> it<00:01:24.270> gives<00:01:24.840> some<00:01:25.020> details<00:01:25.500> on<00:01:25.710> when<00:01:25.979> we

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
and it gives some details on when we

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.800 
and it gives some details on when we
could<00:01:26.280> be<00:01:26.310> seeing<00:01:26.670> these<00:01:26.970> maps<00:01:27.330> because<00:01:27.509> it

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
could be seeing these maps because it

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:30.020 
could be seeing these maps because it
said<00:01:28.110> and<00:01:28.770> what<00:01:29.130> map<00:01:29.340> pack<00:01:29.520> that<00:01:29.700> they<00:01:29.850> would

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:30.030 
said and what map pack that they would

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.700 
said and what map pack that they would
be<00:01:30.180> released<00:01:30.630> so<00:01:30.960> this<00:01:31.110> is<00:01:31.229> of<00:01:31.320> course<00:01:31.350> it's

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
be released so this is of course it's

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.280 
be released so this is of course it's
not<00:01:31.920> final<00:01:32.490> it's<00:01:32.880> not<00:01:33.030> definite<00:01:33.720> but<00:01:33.900> it<00:01:34.140> is

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
not final it's not definite but it is

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:35.990 
not final it's not definite but it is
just<00:01:34.530> something<00:01:34.740> that<00:01:34.950> we<00:01:35.220> have<00:01:35.400> to<00:01:35.430> work<00:01:35.729> from

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
just something that we have to work from

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.609 
just something that we have to work from
at<00:01:36.210> the<00:01:36.420> minute<00:01:36.750> so<00:01:36.900> it<00:01:36.990> says<00:01:37.140> that<00:01:37.290> the<00:01:37.409> maps

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
at the minute so it says that the maps

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.640 
at the minute so it says that the maps
battery<00:01:38.250> Red<00:01:38.759> River<00:01:39.090> Rumble<00:01:39.960> and<00:01:40.140> dome<00:01:40.439> will

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:40.650 
battery Red River Rumble and dome will

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:42.350 
battery Red River Rumble and dome will
all<00:01:40.829> be<00:01:40.979> coming<00:01:41.130> in<00:01:41.369> the<00:01:41.400> third<00:01:41.820> map<00:01:42.090> pack

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
all be coming in the third map pack

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.770 
all be coming in the third map pack
whilst<00:01:42.960> the<00:01:43.200> maps<00:01:43.409> boneyard<00:01:44.070> comp<00:01:44.729> Gaza<00:01:45.360> and

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
whilst the maps boneyard comp Gaza and

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.480 
whilst the maps boneyard comp Gaza and
swamp<00:01:46.200> will<00:01:46.439> all<00:01:46.560> be<00:01:46.649> coming<00:01:46.890> in<00:01:47.040> the<00:01:47.159> fourth

swamp will all be coming in the fourth

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:49.100 
swamp will all be coming in the fourth
map<00:01:47.759> pack<00:01:48.030> so<00:01:48.450> it<00:01:48.509> looks<00:01:48.689> like<00:01:48.750> this<00:01:48.960> might

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:49.110 
map pack so it looks like this might

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:50.929 
map pack so it looks like this might
have<00:01:49.259> been<00:01:49.380> just<00:01:49.590> a<00:01:49.710> partial<00:01:50.040> test<00:01:50.579> of<00:01:50.820> the

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
have been just a partial test of the

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.819 
have been just a partial test of the
maps<00:01:51.210> or<00:01:51.390> something<00:01:51.689> I<00:01:51.810> find<00:01:52.320> it<00:01:52.439> kind<00:01:52.619> of<00:01:52.710> hard

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
maps or something I find it kind of hard

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.319 
maps or something I find it kind of hard
to<00:01:52.950> believe<00:01:53.250> that<00:01:53.399> they've<00:01:53.549> already<00:01:53.670> made<00:01:54.090> all

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:54.329 
to believe that they've already made all

00:01:54.329 --> 00:01:55.940 
to believe that they've already made all
of<00:01:54.360> the<00:01:54.630> maps<00:01:54.869> for<00:01:55.110> the<00:01:55.170> map<00:01:55.320> packs<00:01:55.560> I<00:01:55.740> don't

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
of the maps for the map packs I don't

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.130 
of the maps for the map packs I don't
know<00:01:56.040> whether<00:01:56.189> that<00:01:56.460> is<00:01:56.610> true<00:01:56.640> or<00:01:57.299> not<00:01:57.329> maybe

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
know whether that is true or not maybe

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.469 
know whether that is true or not maybe
the<00:01:58.350> map<00:01:58.979> pack<00:01:59.159> numbers<00:01:59.579> are<00:01:59.729> wrong<00:01:59.969> I'm<00:02:00.270> not

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
the map pack numbers are wrong I'm not

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:02.330 
the map pack numbers are wrong I'm not
sure<00:02:00.540> at<00:02:00.930> the<00:02:01.020> minute<00:02:01.259> but<00:02:01.770> that's<00:02:02.189> the

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
sure at the minute but that's the

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.069 
sure at the minute but that's the
information<00:02:02.790> that<00:02:02.820> that<00:02:03.210> development<00:02:03.540> leaked

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
information that that development leaked

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:07.130 
information that that development leaked
and<00:02:04.369> also<00:02:05.369> this<00:02:05.640> files<00:02:06.149> these<00:02:06.600> code<00:02:06.869> files

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
and also this files these code files

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.589 
and also this files these code files
have<00:02:07.380> given<00:02:07.710> us<00:02:07.860> as<00:02:08.039> well<00:02:08.369> so<00:02:08.789> other<00:02:09.450> than<00:02:09.539> that

00:02:09.589 --> 00:02:09.599 
have given us as well so other than that

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:11.240 
have given us as well so other than that
the<00:02:09.869> only<00:02:10.020> two<00:02:10.259> things<00:02:10.440> to<00:02:10.679> save<00:02:10.890> with<00:02:11.129> the

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
the only two things to save with the

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.740 
the only two things to save with the
extinction<00:02:11.849> maps<00:02:12.060> that<00:02:12.300> look<00:02:12.450> like<00:02:12.569> they're

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:12.750 
extinction maps that look like they're

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:13.400 
extinction maps that look like they're
going<00:02:12.870> to<00:02:12.989> be<00:02:13.080> in

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
going to be in

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.500 
going to be in
the<00:02:13.530> piece<00:02:13.830> of<00:02:13.950> DLC<00:02:14.580> that<00:02:15.060> we're<00:02:15.180> going<00:02:15.300> to<00:02:15.420> be

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
the piece of DLC that we're going to be

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:17.150 
the piece of DLC that we're going to be
having<00:02:15.600> for<00:02:15.870> call<00:02:16.020> of<00:02:16.050> duty<00:02:16.350> ghosts<00:02:16.710> as<00:02:16.860> well

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:17.160 
having for call of duty ghosts as well

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.340 
having for call of duty ghosts as well
and<00:02:17.370> these<00:02:18.030> are<00:02:18.210> just<00:02:18.300> simply<00:02:18.660> listed<00:02:19.170> as

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
and these are just simply listed as

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.940 
and these are just simply listed as
level<00:02:20.190> 2<00:02:20.430> and<00:02:20.460> level<00:02:20.760> 3<00:02:21.150> so<00:02:21.810> it<00:02:21.930> looks<00:02:22.140> like<00:02:22.260> the

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:22.950 
level 2 and level 3 so it looks like the

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.560 
level 2 and level 3 so it looks like the
extinction<00:02:23.490> mode<00:02:23.670> is<00:02:23.880> going<00:02:24.240> to<00:02:24.300> be<00:02:24.390> something

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:24.570 
extinction mode is going to be something

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:25.910 
extinction mode is going to be something
that<00:02:24.660> they're<00:02:24.870> pushing<00:02:25.260> like<00:02:25.410> the<00:02:25.560> zombies

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
that they're pushing like the zombies

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.980 
that they're pushing like the zombies
mode<00:02:26.070> from<00:02:26.280> the<00:02:26.490> trout<00:02:26.850> games<00:02:27.150> and<00:02:27.390> they're

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:27.990 
mode from the trout games and they're

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:29.150 
mode from the trout games and they're
going<00:02:28.140> to<00:02:28.200> be<00:02:28.290> getting<00:02:28.470> something<00:02:28.620> else<00:02:28.860> e<00:02:28.980> for

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:29.160 
going to be getting something else e for

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.620 
going to be getting something else e for
that<00:02:29.280> so<00:02:29.430> that<00:02:29.580> it's<00:02:29.730> cool<00:02:29.910> because<00:02:30.000> I<00:02:30.150> do<00:02:30.210> like

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:30.630 
that so that it's cool because I do like

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:32.180 
that so that it's cool because I do like
the<00:02:30.780> extinction<00:02:31.290> mode<00:02:31.410> then<00:02:31.830> it<00:02:31.950> gets<00:02:32.040> a

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.190 
the extinction mode then it gets a

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.100 
the extinction mode then it gets a
little<00:02:32.400> bit<00:02:32.580> of<00:02:32.670> getting<00:02:32.850> used<00:02:32.970> to<00:02:33.420> but<00:02:33.720> it<00:02:33.930> is

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
little bit of getting used to but it is

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:35.510 
little bit of getting used to but it is
a<00:02:34.140> bit<00:02:34.350> of<00:02:34.470> fun<00:02:34.650> which<00:02:34.830> you<00:02:34.950> get<00:02:35.100> into<00:02:35.370> and

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
a bit of fun which you get into and

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:37.150 
a bit of fun which you get into and
hopefully<00:02:35.910> they<00:02:36.030> can<00:02:36.150> take<00:02:36.330> it<00:02:36.510> places<00:02:36.750> and

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:37.160 
hopefully they can take it places and

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:39.890 
hopefully they can take it places and
improve<00:02:38.160> it<00:02:38.370> more<00:02:38.970> and<00:02:39.240> more<00:02:39.330> and<00:02:39.480> more<00:02:39.630> as<00:02:39.810> the

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
improve it more and more and more as the

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.390 
improve it more and more and more as the
maps<00:02:40.050> go<00:02:40.230> on<00:02:40.380> so<00:02:40.770> what<00:02:40.920> do<00:02:40.980> you<00:02:41.040> reckon<00:02:41.310> of

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
maps go on so what do you reckon of

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.830 
maps go on so what do you reckon of
these<00:02:41.520> map<00:02:41.790> names<00:02:42.030> do<00:02:42.180> you<00:02:42.210> reckon<00:02:42.570> they<00:02:42.690> are

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
these map names do you reckon they are

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.870 
these map names do you reckon they are
real<00:02:43.140> or<00:02:43.470> not<00:02:43.500> and<00:02:44.190> do<00:02:44.370> you<00:02:44.460> think<00:02:44.670> they<00:02:44.850> will

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:44.880 
real or not and do you think they will

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.760 
real or not and do you think they will
be<00:02:45.090> coming<00:02:45.300> in<00:02:45.540> the<00:02:45.930> third<00:02:46.140> and<00:02:46.320> fourth<00:02:46.500> map

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:46.770 
be coming in the third and fourth map

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:48.710 
be coming in the third and fourth map
packs<00:02:47.040> as<00:02:47.250> I've<00:02:47.370> said<00:02:47.610> with<00:02:48.270> just<00:02:48.540> that<00:02:48.660> one

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
packs as I've said with just that one

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:50.630 
packs as I've said with just that one
map<00:02:49.140> in<00:02:49.350> the<00:02:49.380> second<00:02:49.860> map<00:02:50.010> pack<00:02:50.220> force<00:02:50.520> is

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640 
map in the second map pack force is

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:51.740 
map in the second map pack force is
going<00:02:50.760> to<00:02:50.820> be<00:02:50.880> more<00:02:51.150> but<00:02:51.300> they've<00:02:51.420> just<00:02:51.570> not

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:51.750 
going to be more but they've just not

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.930 
going to be more but they've just not
shown<00:02:52.050> or<00:02:52.260> linked<00:02:53.160> them<00:02:53.340> at<00:02:53.430> the<00:02:53.520> minute<00:02:53.790> and

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:53.940 
shown or linked them at the minute and

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.550
