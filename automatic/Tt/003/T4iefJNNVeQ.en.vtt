half one okay so we've created the top
half<00:02:28.270> of<00:02:28.420> our<00:02:28.600> tree<00:02:28.930> and<00:02:30.720> then<00:02:31.720> what<00:02:31.900> we're

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.020 
half of our tree and then what we're

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:34.740 
half of our tree and then what we're
going<00:02:32.170> to<00:02:32.350> do<00:02:32.560> is<00:02:32.970> I'm<00:02:33.970> going<00:02:34.240> to<00:02:34.300> line<00:02:34.510> it<00:02:34.540> up

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
going to do is I'm going to line it up

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:40.590 
going to do is I'm going to line it up
with<00:02:34.959> my<00:02:36.480> grid<00:02:37.480> so<00:02:38.080> I've<00:02:38.230> got<00:02:39.209> two<00:02:40.209> squares

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:40.600 
with my grid so I've got two squares

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:43.199 
with my grid so I've got two squares
here<00:02:40.989> and<00:02:41.320> a<00:02:41.410> white<00:02:41.650> line<00:02:41.920> 2<00:02:42.489> squared<00:02:42.850> here<00:02:43.090> in

00:02:43.199 --> 00:02:43.209 
here and a white line 2 squared here in

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:44.940 
here and a white line 2 squared here in
a<00:02:43.270> white<00:02:43.420> lines<00:02:43.660> I<00:02:43.810> know<00:02:43.989> that's<00:02:44.230> the<00:02:44.470> center

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:44.950 
a white lines I know that's the center

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:48.690 
a white lines I know that's the center
and<00:02:45.280> then<00:02:45.750> what<00:02:46.750> I'm<00:02:46.870> going<00:02:47.020> to<00:02:47.110> do<00:02:47.380> is<00:02:47.700> fold

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
and then what I'm going to do is fold

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:55.770 
and then what I'm going to do is fold
down<00:02:49.090> one<00:02:49.750> half<00:02:50.170> of<00:02:51.989> that<00:02:53.850> and<00:02:54.850> press<00:02:55.239> down<00:02:55.540> and

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
down one half of that and press down and

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.690 
down one half of that and press down and
I've<00:02:56.380> still<00:02:56.620> got<00:02:56.769> the<00:02:56.950> original<00:02:57.100> one

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:57.700 
I've still got the original one

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.800 
I've still got the original one
underneath<00:02:58.000> it<00:02:58.410> the<00:02:59.410> back<00:02:59.620> there<00:03:00.600> fold<00:03:01.600> this

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:01.810 
underneath it the back there fold this

00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:03.750 
underneath it the back there fold this
one<00:03:02.050> down<00:03:02.290> and<00:03:02.860> as<00:03:03.040> you<00:03:03.130> can<00:03:03.280> see<00:03:03.310> with<00:03:03.640> the

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:03.760 
one down and as you can see with the

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.900 
one down and as you can see with the
pattern<00:03:04.540> paper<00:03:04.810> we're<00:03:05.110> creating<00:03:05.730> some<00:03:06.730> nice

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:06.910 
pattern paper we're creating some nice

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:09.090 
pattern paper we're creating some nice
funky<00:03:07.390> shapes<00:03:07.570> and<00:03:07.900> that's<00:03:08.170> one<00:03:08.440> tier<00:03:08.769> done

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:09.100 
funky shapes and that's one tier done

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.400 
funky shapes and that's one tier done
that's<00:03:09.459> the<00:03:09.610> bottom<00:03:09.910> tier<00:03:10.180> let's<00:03:10.930> continue

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
that's the bottom tier let's continue

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:17.670 
that's the bottom tier let's continue
with<00:03:11.860> the<00:03:12.100> next<00:03:12.130> here<00:03:12.959> so<00:03:13.959> tip<00:03:14.350> to<00:03:14.560> tip<00:03:16.680> there

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
with the next here so tip to tip there

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:26.590 
with the next here so tip to tip there
we<00:03:17.830> go<00:03:19.920> tip<00:03:20.920> to<00:03:21.160> tip<00:03:21.400> here

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:26.600 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:31.920 

in<00:03:27.170> half<00:03:28.390> and<00:03:29.390> that's<00:03:30.350> all<00:03:30.560> the<00:03:30.710> folding<00:03:31.160> done

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:31.930 
in half and that's all the folding done

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:34.720 
in half and that's all the folding done
okay<00:03:32.930> so<00:03:32.990> using<00:03:33.530> those<00:03:33.680> crease<00:03:34.070> lines<00:03:34.400> we're

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:34.730 
okay so using those crease lines we're

00:03:34.730 --> 00:03:38.590 
okay so using those crease lines we're
going<00:03:34.820> to<00:03:34.940> push<00:03:35.120> that<00:03:35.150> one<00:03:35.480> up<00:03:35.660> and<00:03:37.390> that<00:03:38.390> one

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:38.600 
going to push that one up and that one

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.850 
going to push that one up and that one
up<00:03:38.780> and<00:03:39.080> into<00:03:40.070> the<00:03:40.160> middle<00:03:40.900> lay<00:03:41.900> it<00:03:42.020> flat<00:03:42.230> press

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:42.860 
up and into the middle lay it flat press

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:46.870 
up and into the middle lay it flat press
it<00:03:43.010> down<00:03:43.040> and<00:03:44.020> then<00:03:45.020> the<00:03:45.170> next<00:03:45.200> one<00:03:45.590> will<00:03:46.520> fold

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:46.880 
it down and then the next one will fold

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.210 
it down and then the next one will fold
down<00:03:47.150> so<00:03:47.510> once<00:03:47.720> again<00:03:47.930> I'll<00:03:48.290> find<00:03:48.590> a<00:03:48.800> square

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:49.220 
down so once again I'll find a square

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:52.390 
down so once again I'll find a square
that's<00:03:49.520> about<00:03:49.910> the<00:03:50.390> same<00:03:50.600> size<00:03:51.070> so<00:03:52.070> I've<00:03:52.190> got

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:52.400 
that's about the same size so I've got

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.630 
that's about the same size so I've got
one<00:03:52.640> square<00:03:53.060> in<00:03:53.270> one<00:03:54.080> square<00:03:54.500> in<00:03:54.680> that<00:03:55.370> means

00:03:55.630 --> 00:03:55.640 
one square in one square in that means

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.990 
one square in one square in that means
that's<00:03:55.850> the<00:03:56.120> center<00:03:57.370> put<00:03:58.370> my<00:03:58.490> now<00:03:58.670> they're

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 
that's the center put my now they're

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.040 
that's the center put my now they're
just<00:03:59.030> to<00:03:59.390> stop<00:03:59.630> it<00:03:59.780> from<00:03:59.960> over<00:04:00.530> folding<00:04:01.040> and

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:02.050 
just to stop it from over folding and

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:06.700 
just to stop it from over folding and
push<00:04:03.050> down<00:04:03.080> lift<00:04:03.800> this<00:04:03.950> one<00:04:04.160> up<00:04:05.440> hold<00:04:06.440> me<00:04:06.560> now

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:06.710 
push down lift this one up hold me now

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:10.390 
push down lift this one up hold me now
down<00:04:06.980> there<00:04:07.280> we<00:04:07.430> go<00:04:08.500> tier<00:04:09.500> two<00:04:09.770> of<00:04:09.950> our<00:04:10.100> tree

00:04:10.390 --> 00:04:10.400 
down there we go tier two of our tree

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.700 
down there we go tier two of our tree
done<00:04:10.640> it's<00:04:11.600> coming<00:04:11.990> together<00:04:12.200> quite<00:04:12.620> nicely

00:04:12.700 --> 00:04:12.710 
done it's coming together quite nicely

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:15.910 
done it's coming together quite nicely
and<00:04:13.700> the<00:04:14.690> last<00:04:14.900> little<00:04:15.140> one<00:04:15.350> so<00:04:15.620> this<00:04:15.710> one<00:04:15.770> will

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:15.920 
and the last little one so this one will

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:17.560 
and the last little one so this one will
be<00:04:16.040> a<00:04:16.070> little<00:04:16.100> bit<00:04:16.430> tricky<00:04:16.820> because<00:04:17.150> it<00:04:17.420> is<00:04:17.540> a

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:17.570 
be a little bit tricky because it is a

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:19.960 
be a little bit tricky because it is a
bit<00:04:17.810> small<00:04:17.989> piece<00:04:18.380> of<00:04:18.560> paper<00:04:18.770> but<00:04:19.640> you<00:04:19.730> still

00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:19.970 
bit small piece of paper but you still

00:04:19.970 --> 00:04:24.250 
bit small piece of paper but you still
be<00:04:20.090> able<00:04:20.150> to<00:04:20.299> do<00:04:20.420> it<00:04:20.450> I'm<00:04:20.720> sure<00:04:21.410> you<00:04:21.560> will<00:04:23.260> and

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:24.260 
be able to do it I'm sure you will and

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:26.260 
be able to do it I'm sure you will and
as<00:04:24.410> you<00:04:24.530> can<00:04:24.710> see<00:04:24.740> this<00:04:25.670> is<00:04:25.850> one<00:04:26.030> of<00:04:26.060> the

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:26.270 
as you can see this is one of the

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:28.780 
as you can see this is one of the
quicker<00:04:26.480> projects<00:04:27.140> that<00:04:27.290> we've<00:04:27.410> got<00:04:27.650> in<00:04:27.920> our

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:28.790 
quicker projects that we've got in our

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:34.200 
quicker projects that we've got in our

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:40.030 
here we are and I'm sure this would look

00:04:40.030 --> 00:04:44.460

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:53.390 
traditional color it's not quite pointy
enough<00:04:48.460> for<00:04:48.940> me<00:04:49.800> okay<00:04:50.800> pushing<00:04:51.639> it<00:04:51.759> down<00:04:52.229> so
