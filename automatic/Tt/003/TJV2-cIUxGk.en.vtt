00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760 
one flaw which I can think of you know

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.910 
one flaw which I can think of you know
when<00:03:21.120> looking<00:03:21.360> at<00:03:21.450> this<00:03:21.600> model<00:03:21.780> the<00:03:22.140> color<00:03:22.380> in

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:22.920 
when looking at this model the color in

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.910 
when looking at this model the color in
the<00:03:23.100> TV<00:03:23.400> series<00:03:23.790> um<00:03:24.060> she<00:03:24.720> has<00:03:24.840> a<00:03:24.870> lighter<00:03:25.620> brown

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
the TV series um she has a lighter brown

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.740 
the TV series um she has a lighter brown
color<00:03:25.980> however<00:03:26.670> on<00:03:26.970> the<00:03:27.060> Hornby<00:03:27.360> model<00:03:27.630> it's

00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:27.750 
color however on the Hornby model it's

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.140 
color however on the Hornby model it's
almost<00:03:27.930> like<00:03:28.140> a<00:03:28.170> dark<00:03:28.980> brown<00:03:29.280> I<00:03:29.640> don't<00:03:30.090> know

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:30.150 
almost like a dark brown I don't know

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:32.630 
almost like a dark brown I don't know
why<00:03:30.330> Hardy<00:03:30.750> did<00:03:30.930> that<00:03:31.110> cuz<00:03:32.010> I<00:03:32.130> do<00:03:32.190> know<00:03:32.490> they

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:32.640 
why Hardy did that cuz I do know they

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:35.840 
why Hardy did that cuz I do know they
have<00:03:32.850> this<00:03:33.120> coach<00:03:33.540> in<00:03:33.960> their<00:03:34.590> range<00:03:34.890> and<00:03:35.370> I

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:35.850 
have this coach in their range and I

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:37.820 
have this coach in their range and I
believe<00:03:36.390> it<00:03:36.510> is<00:03:36.600> this<00:03:36.810> color<00:03:37.110> so<00:03:37.380> I<00:03:37.440> think<00:03:37.530> they

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:37.830 
believe it is this color so I think they

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:39.800 
believe it is this color so I think they
just<00:03:37.860> like<00:03:38.130> left<00:03:39.030> the<00:03:39.150> coach<00:03:39.330> and<00:03:39.570> then<00:03:39.690> they

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:39.810 
just like left the coach and then they

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.830 
just like left the coach and then they
just<00:03:40.020> pop<00:03:40.350> the<00:03:40.500> face<00:03:40.710> on<00:03:40.950> and<00:03:41.130> I<00:03:41.190> believe<00:03:41.840> any

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
just pop the face on and I believe any

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.900 
just pop the face on and I believe any
other<00:03:43.050> tops<00:03:43.290> very<00:03:43.590> nice<00:03:43.800> one<00:03:44.490> thing<00:03:44.640> I<00:03:44.700> do<00:03:44.760> have

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:44.910

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
got us which really surprised me as this

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.200 
got us which really surprised me as this
was<00:03:49.410> my<00:03:49.560> first<00:03:49.770> time<00:03:50.100> to<00:03:50.190> be<00:03:50.220> coach<00:03:50.520> I<00:03:50.760> ever<00:03:50.820> got

00:03:54.830 --> 00:03:54.840 
she is extremely light I mean we haven't

00:03:54.840 --> 00:03:56.720 
she is extremely light I mean we haven't
gotten<00:03:55.080> into<00:03:55.290> the<00:03:55.410> Bachmann<00:03:55.890> coaches<00:03:56.280> yet<00:03:56.490> but

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:56.730 
gotten into the Bachmann coaches yet but

00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:58.220 
gotten into the Bachmann coaches yet but
if<00:03:56.820> you<00:03:56.910> were<00:03:57.030> to<00:03:57.090> put<00:03:57.300> or<00:03:57.510> compare<00:03:57.870> this<00:03:58.020> to

00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:58.230 
if you were to put or compare this to

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:00.920 
if you were to put or compare this to
the<00:03:58.320> Bachmann<00:03:58.740> Express<00:03:59.100> coaches<00:03:59.420> she<00:04:00.420> is<00:04:00.570> just

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:00.930 
the Bachmann Express coaches she is just

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:02.990 
the Bachmann Express coaches she is just
so<00:04:01.410> much<00:04:01.530> lighter<00:04:01.800> now<00:04:02.400> I<00:04:02.430> don't<00:04:02.610> own<00:04:02.850> the

00:04:02.990 --> 00:04:03.000 
so much lighter now I don't own the

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.470 
so much lighter now I don't own the
Hornady<00:04:03.390> Express<00:04:03.780> coaches<00:04:04.670> but<00:04:05.670> my

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
Hornady Express coaches but my

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.360 
Hornady Express coaches but my
prediction<00:04:06.870> is<00:04:06.900> that<00:04:07.080> they<00:04:07.230> are<00:04:07.350> light<00:04:07.590> if<00:04:07.860> any

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:08.370 
prediction is that they are light if any

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:10.070 
prediction is that they are light if any
of<00:04:08.490> you<00:04:08.580> own<00:04:08.790> like<00:04:09.090> the<00:04:09.240> Horn<00:04:09.420> of<00:04:09.480> the<00:04:09.600> Gordon

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:10.080 
of you own like the Horn of the Gordon

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:12.050
