hi guys and welcome to two minute tips
for<00:00:06.300> autism<00:00:06.960> well<00:00:07.230> we<00:00:07.529> have<00:00:07.680> dr.<00:00:08.069> Rossignol

for autism well we have dr. Rossignol

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.759 
for autism well we have dr. Rossignol
and<00:00:08.850> we're<00:00:09.420> just<00:00:09.510> super<00:00:09.690> excited<00:00:10.230> because<00:00:10.380> we

and we're just super excited because we

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:14.210 
and we're just super excited because we
have<00:00:10.800> a<00:00:11.040> very<00:00:11.490> hot<00:00:11.820> topic<00:00:12.200> stem<00:00:13.200> cells<00:00:13.500> is<00:00:13.800> it

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:14.220 
have a very hot topic stem cells is it

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:15.800 
have a very hot topic stem cells is it
good<00:00:14.490> is<00:00:14.730> it<00:00:14.760> bad<00:00:14.910> that<00:00:15.420> we<00:00:15.510> need<00:00:15.660> more

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:15.810 
good is it bad that we need more

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:19.189 
good is it bad that we need more
research<00:00:16.170> what<00:00:16.859> the<00:00:17.010> heck<00:00:17.269> well<00:00:18.269> obviously

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:19.199 
research what the heck well obviously

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:20.900 
research what the heck well obviously
when<00:00:19.439> we're<00:00:19.560> talking<00:00:19.650> about<00:00:19.800> autism<00:00:20.730> and

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910 
when we're talking about autism and

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.159 
when we're talking about autism and
other<00:00:21.029> developmental<00:00:21.210> disorders<00:00:21.990> we're

00:00:22.159 --> 00:00:22.169 
other developmental disorders we're

00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:24.019 
other developmental disorders we're
looking<00:00:22.410> for<00:00:22.589> treatments<00:00:23.009> right<00:00:23.130> so<00:00:23.759> we<00:00:23.849> want

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:24.029 
looking for treatments right so we want

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.040 
looking for treatments right so we want
something<00:00:24.269> that's<00:00:24.419> going<00:00:24.509> to<00:00:24.570> help<00:00:24.749> our<00:00:24.869> kids

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:25.050 
something that's going to help our kids

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:28.609 
something that's going to help our kids
so<00:00:25.769> my<00:00:26.550> philosophy<00:00:26.699> is<00:00:27.119> try<00:00:27.570> at<00:00:28.199> least<00:00:28.259> in<00:00:28.560> the

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619 
so my philosophy is try at least in the

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.050 
so my philosophy is try at least in the
beginning<00:00:28.859> to<00:00:29.099> use<00:00:29.249> things<00:00:29.609> that<00:00:29.699> are<00:00:29.789> well

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060 
beginning to use things that are well

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.359 
beginning to use things that are well
studied<00:00:30.439> that<00:00:31.439> might<00:00:31.589> include<00:00:31.829> diet<00:00:32.130> and

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:32.369 
studied that might include diet and

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:34.010 
studied that might include diet and
supplements<00:00:32.970> and<00:00:33.090> certain<00:00:33.270> medications<00:00:33.840> and

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
supplements and certain medications and

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.870 
supplements and certain medications and
things<00:00:34.140> like<00:00:34.260> that<00:00:34.320> and<00:00:34.829> then<00:00:35.280> once<00:00:35.700> you

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
things like that and then once you

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.370 
things like that and then once you
exhaust<00:00:36.300> some<00:00:36.630> of<00:00:36.750> those<00:00:36.840> things<00:00:37.170> then

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
exhaust some of those things then

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:38.900 
exhaust some of those things then
certainly<00:00:37.650> you<00:00:37.740> might<00:00:37.920> start<00:00:38.370> looking<00:00:38.460> at

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
certainly you might start looking at

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.520 
certainly you might start looking at
other<00:00:39.030> treatments<00:00:39.540> and<00:00:39.870> stem<00:00:40.170> cells<00:00:40.410> would

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:40.530 
other treatments and stem cells would

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.350 
other treatments and stem cells would
kind<00:00:40.740> of<00:00:40.770> fall<00:00:40.920> into<00:00:41.070> that<00:00:41.220> category<00:00:41.400> so<00:00:42.240> there

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:42.360 
kind of fall into that category so there

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.960 
kind of fall into that category so there
aren't<00:00:42.600> any<00:00:42.780> studies<00:00:43.230> to<00:00:43.920> date<00:00:44.100> on<00:00:44.460> using<00:00:44.790> stem

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:44.970 
aren't any studies to date on using stem

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:46.760 
aren't any studies to date on using stem
cells<00:00:45.240> in<00:00:45.360> autism<00:00:45.660> there's<00:00:46.380> some<00:00:46.560> ongoing

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
cells in autism there's some ongoing

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.230 
cells in autism there's some ongoing
study<00:00:47.250> there's<00:00:47.460> one<00:00:47.580> in<00:00:47.730> India<00:00:48.000> there's

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:48.240 
study there's one in India there's

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:49.460 
study there's one in India there's
getting<00:00:48.390> one<00:00:48.570> that's<00:00:48.960> gonna<00:00:49.080> be<00:00:49.230> starting

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:49.470 
getting one that's gonna be starting

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:51.500 
getting one that's gonna be starting
California<00:00:50.040> so<00:00:50.550> I<00:00:50.580> think<00:00:50.670> we'll<00:00:50.880> know<00:00:51.060> more<00:00:51.090> as

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
California so I think we'll know more as

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.530 
California so I think we'll know more as
these<00:00:51.750> studies<00:00:52.050> are<00:00:52.170> done<00:00:52.350> so<00:00:53.060> I've<00:00:54.060> had<00:00:54.360> a<00:00:54.390> lot

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:54.540 
these studies are done so I've had a lot

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:56.150 
these studies are done so I've had a lot
of<00:00:54.570> patients<00:00:55.050> who've<00:00:55.260> gone<00:00:55.410> overseas<00:00:55.650> and

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:56.160 
of patients who've gone overseas and

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.100 
of patients who've gone overseas and
done<00:00:56.370> stem<00:00:56.610> cells<00:00:56.880> and<00:00:57.150> there<00:00:57.660> was<00:00:57.750> also<00:00:57.870> been

00:00:58.100 --> 00:00:58.110 
done stem cells and there was also been

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:59.810 
done stem cells and there was also been
extremely<00:00:58.710> variable<00:00:59.010> and<00:00:59.250> some<00:00:59.430> kids<00:00:59.640> have

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
extremely variable and some kids have

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.120 
extremely variable and some kids have
had<00:00:59.970> some<00:01:00.720> you<00:01:01.140> know<00:01:01.230> fairly<00:01:01.800> impressive

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:02.130 
had some you know fairly impressive

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:03.950 
had some you know fairly impressive
improvements<00:01:02.760> it's<00:01:03.060> a<00:01:03.150> fairly<00:01:03.360> small<00:01:03.480> number

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:03.960 
improvements it's a fairly small number

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.140 
improvements it's a fairly small number
I<00:01:03.990> think<00:01:04.140> a<00:01:04.619> lot<00:01:05.159> of<00:01:05.280> kids<00:01:05.460> who<00:01:05.670> have<00:01:05.759> had<00:01:05.909> mild

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
I think a lot of kids who have had mild

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.730 
I think a lot of kids who have had mild
improvements<00:01:06.720> maybe<00:01:07.320> they're<00:01:07.470> a<00:01:07.500> little<00:01:07.530> bit

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
improvements maybe they're a little bit

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.620 
improvements maybe they're a little bit
calmer<00:01:07.950> I've<00:01:08.340> had<00:01:08.520> some<00:01:08.730> kids<00:01:09.120> I've<00:01:09.270> gone<00:01:09.420> and

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
calmer I've had some kids I've gone and

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.450 
calmer I've had some kids I've gone and
done<00:01:09.720> several<00:01:10.070> transplant<00:01:11.070> and<00:01:11.159> had<00:01:11.250> no

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
done several transplant and had no

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:13.430 
done several transplant and had no
improvement<00:01:11.880> and<00:01:12.060> even<00:01:12.840> seen<00:01:12.960> some<00:01:13.080> kids<00:01:13.290> I<00:01:13.350> do

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:13.440 
improvement and even seen some kids I do

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.800 
improvement and even seen some kids I do
a<00:01:13.470> little<00:01:13.590> bit<00:01:13.710> worse<00:01:13.860> so<00:01:14.190> I<00:01:14.220> think<00:01:14.600> the<00:01:15.600> issue

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810 
a little bit worse so I think the issue

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:16.940 
a little bit worse so I think the issue
that<00:01:15.960> we<00:01:16.080> have<00:01:16.170> right<00:01:16.320> now<00:01:16.350> is<00:01:16.560> are<00:01:16.650> so<00:01:16.800> many

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:16.950 
that we have right now is are so many

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:18.649 
that we have right now is are so many
places<00:01:17.250> doing<00:01:17.400> it<00:01:17.580> in<00:01:17.670> the<00:01:17.730> world<00:01:17.909> and<00:01:18.150> there's

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
places doing it in the world and there's

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:20.390 
places doing it in the world and there's
no<00:01:18.810> standard<00:01:19.409> protocol<00:01:19.800> everyone's<00:01:20.250> doing

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400 
no standard protocol everyone's doing

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.010 
no standard protocol everyone's doing
sort<00:01:20.790> of<00:01:20.880> different<00:01:21.210> cells<00:01:21.420> different<00:01:21.840> types

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
sort of different cells different types

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.300 
sort of different cells different types
or<00:01:22.200> do<00:01:22.260> you<00:01:22.320> inject<00:01:22.590> it<00:01:22.740> you<00:01:22.860> have<00:01:22.979> to<00:01:23.070> do<00:01:23.190> it

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:23.310 
or do you inject it you have to do it

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:25.940 
or do you inject it you have to do it
into<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.180> IV<00:01:24.510> into<00:01:24.930> the<00:01:25.020> spinal<00:01:25.380> fluid<00:01:25.409> you<00:01:25.830> do

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:25.950 
into the IV into the spinal fluid you do

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:28.550 
into the IV into the spinal fluid you do
it<00:01:26.040> into<00:01:26.280> the<00:01:26.370> brain<00:01:26.810> you<00:01:27.810> know<00:01:27.930> what<00:01:28.350> type<00:01:28.530> of

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
it into the brain you know what type of

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.050 
it into the brain you know what type of
stem<00:01:28.860> cells<00:01:29.130> do<00:01:29.280> you<00:01:29.340> use<00:01:29.580> where<00:01:29.820> do<00:01:29.880> you<00:01:29.940> take

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
stem cells do you use where do you take

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.940 
stem cells do you use where do you take
them<00:01:30.120> from<00:01:30.450> when<00:01:31.140> should<00:01:31.350> you<00:01:31.440> do<00:01:31.590> them<00:01:31.740> what

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:31.950 
them from when should you do them what

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:32.990 
them from when should you do them what
all<00:01:32.070> the<00:01:32.220> treatment<00:01:32.580> should<00:01:32.670> you<00:01:32.760> do<00:01:32.850> with

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
all the treatment should you do with

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:33.830 
all the treatment should you do with

them so I think there's a lot of
unanswered<00:01:34.229> questions

unanswered questions

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.680
