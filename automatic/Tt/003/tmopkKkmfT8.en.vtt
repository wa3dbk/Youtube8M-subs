00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
restricted area alright then uh we also

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.950 
restricted area alright then uh we also
noticed<00:01:26.220> we<00:01:26.400> know<00:01:26.549> trio<00:01:26.820> was<00:01:27.000> liberated<00:01:27.540> and

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
it says April seventh 1987 which we

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.640 
it says April seventh 1987 which we
think<00:01:32.840> April<00:01:33.840> 7th<00:01:34.200> is<00:01:34.290> when<00:01:34.439> they'll<00:01:34.560> be

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:34.650 
think April 7th is when they'll be

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:36.859 
think April 7th is when they'll be
releasing<00:01:35.009> a<00:01:35.070> map<00:01:35.250> pack<00:01:35.460> as<00:01:35.820> some<00:01:36.420> say<00:01:36.570> added

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
releasing a map pack as some say added

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.890 
releasing a map pack as some say added
it<00:01:36.990> as<00:01:37.079> a<00:01:37.140> clue<00:01:37.470> to<00:01:37.799> this<00:01:37.890> map<00:01:38.790> well<00:01:39.600> if<00:01:39.750> you<00:01:39.810> go

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
it as a clue to this map well if you go

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.300 
it as a clue to this map well if you go
outside<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.229> map<00:01:40.439> you<00:01:40.680> notice<00:01:40.979> there's<00:01:41.220> this

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
outside the map you notice there's this

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.270 
outside the map you notice there's this
day<00:01:41.549> helicopter<00:01:42.270> here<00:01:42.799> it's<00:01:43.799> already<00:01:44.009> running

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
day helicopter here it's already running

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.800 
day helicopter here it's already running
so<00:01:44.700> I<00:01:44.729> think<00:01:44.850> it<00:01:45.060> might<00:01:45.210> have<00:01:45.509> something<00:01:45.689> to

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:45.810 
so I think it might have something to

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.749 
so I think it might have something to
with<00:01:45.960> Nazis<00:01:46.259> on<00:01:46.380> these<00:01:46.590> I<00:01:46.799> don't<00:01:46.950> know<00:01:47.040> why<00:01:47.610> did

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
with Nazis on these I don't know why did

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:49.069 
with Nazis on these I don't know why did
adage<00:01:48.030> the<00:01:48.210> helicopter<00:01:48.630> running<00:01:48.869> for<00:01:49.020> no

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
adage the helicopter running for no

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:51.760 
adage the helicopter running for no
reason<00:01:49.470> plus<00:01:50.280> it'd<00:01:50.399> be<00:01:50.460> like<00:01:50.549> a<00:01:50.610> clue<00:01:50.939> and

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770 
reason plus it'd be like a clue and

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.859 
reason plus it'd be like a clue and
there's<00:01:52.770> also<00:01:52.950> two<00:01:53.700> M<00:01:53.939> 60s<00:01:54.390> on<00:01:54.450> each<00:01:54.600> side

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
there's also two M 60s on each side

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.340 
there's also two M 60s on each side
that's<00:01:55.380> for<00:01:55.619> EM<00:01:55.799> 60s<00:01:56.509> maybe<00:01:57.509> meaning<00:01:58.020> that<00:01:58.140> you

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:58.350 
that's for EM 60s maybe meaning that you

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:00.370 
that's for EM 60s maybe meaning that you
get<00:01:58.500> to<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:58.680> m60<00:01:59.189> and<00:01:59.430> the<00:01:59.549> new<00:01:59.670> zombies<00:02:00.030> map

American<00:02:27.550> character<00:02:27.700> because<00:02:29.130> then<00:02:30.130> here's

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:30.370 
American character because then here's

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.449 
American character because then here's
the<00:02:30.430> rolling<00:02:30.819> door<00:02:31.830> the<00:02:32.830> wheels<00:02:33.069> i<00:02:33.280> think

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:33.459 
the rolling door the wheels i think

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:35.900 
the rolling door the wheels i think
it'll<00:02:33.580> roll<00:02:33.849> out<00:02:34.030> that<00:02:34.270> way<00:02:34.450> and<00:02:34.599> open<00:02:34.870> up<00:02:34.989> and

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:35.910 
it'll roll out that way and open up and

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.390 
it'll roll out that way and open up and
it<00:02:36.910> says<00:02:37.180> no<00:02:38.110> unauthorized<00:02:38.739> vehicles<00:02:39.130> beyond

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:39.400 
it says no unauthorized vehicles beyond

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.070 
it says no unauthorized vehicles beyond
this<00:02:39.520> point<00:02:39.700> maybe<00:02:40.300> it<00:02:40.420> has<00:02:40.510> something<00:02:40.540> to<00:02:40.959> do

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:41.080 
this point maybe it has something to do

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:43.350 
this point maybe it has something to do
with<00:02:41.200> the<00:02:41.290> helicopter<00:02:42.120> something<00:02:43.120> and

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360 
with the helicopter something and

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:46.320 
with the helicopter something and
there's<00:02:43.630> that<00:02:43.750> sign<00:02:43.989> over<00:02:44.020> there<00:02:44.260> and<00:02:45.209> this<00:02:46.209> is

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.330 
there's that sign over there and this is

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:48.570 
there's that sign over there and this is
a<00:02:46.360> gateway<00:02:46.720> so<00:02:47.319> he<00:02:48.130> could<00:02:48.250> be<00:02:48.310> talking<00:02:48.519> about

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:48.580 
a gateway so he could be talking about

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:51.780 
a gateway so he could be talking about
this<00:02:48.840> it<00:02:49.840> leads<00:02:50.080> to<00:02:50.290> the<00:02:50.440> runway<00:02:51.310> over<00:02:51.640> there

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:51.790 
this it leads to the runway over there

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.770 
this it leads to the runway over there
there's<00:02:52.300> airplanes<00:02:54.060> alright<00:02:55.060> if<00:02:55.360> you<00:02:55.540> go<00:02:55.720> to

00:02:55.770 --> 00:02:55.780 
there's airplanes alright if you go to

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.530 
there's airplanes alright if you go to
mission<00:02:56.170> select<00:02:56.530> you<00:02:56.709> can<00:02:56.860> tell<00:02:57.100> like

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:57.540 
mission select you can tell like

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:00.479 
mission select you can tell like
personals<00:02:58.540> operating<00:02:58.930> for<00:02:59.140> operation<00:02:59.890> 14<00:03:00.310> in

personals operating for operation 14 in

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:02.220 
personals operating for operation 14 in
Vorkuta<00:03:00.670> which<00:03:01.239> are<00:03:01.420> they<00:03:01.690> don't<00:03:01.840> have<00:03:01.930> zombie

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:02.230 
Vorkuta which are they don't have zombie

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:04.410 
Vorkuta which are they don't have zombie
maps<00:03:02.410> like<00:03:02.560> that<00:03:02.739> then<00:03:03.700> you<00:03:03.730> start<00:03:04.090> off<00:03:04.209> with

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
maps like that then you start off with

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.330 
maps like that then you start off with
kino<00:03:04.780> but<00:03:05.170> then<00:03:05.290> after<00:03:05.560> that<00:03:05.709> you<00:03:05.920> get<00:03:06.010> five

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
kino but then after that you get five

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:09.600 
kino but then after that you get five
which<00:03:06.880> is<00:03:07.030> us<00:03:07.360> DVD<00:03:07.510> the<00:03:07.989> Pentagon<00:03:08.430> then<00:03:09.430> you<00:03:09.519> go

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:09.610 
which is us DVD the Pentagon then you go

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:12.150 
which is us DVD the Pentagon then you go
to<00:03:09.670> executive<00:03:10.090> order<00:03:10.480> which<00:03:10.720> is<00:03:10.930> launched<00:03:11.170> in

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160 
to executive order which is launched in

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.990 
to executive order which is launched in
Ascension<00:03:12.730> and<00:03:12.880> then<00:03:13.450> what's<00:03:14.350> pretty<00:03:14.650> much

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
Ascension and then what's pretty much

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.220 
Ascension and then what's pretty much
already<00:03:16.000> revealed<00:03:16.750> that's<00:03:16.959> gonna<00:03:17.049> be<00:03:17.170> the

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:17.230 
already revealed that's gonna be the

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:20.490 
already revealed that's gonna be the
next<00:03:17.319> zombie<00:03:17.890> map<00:03:18.220> a<00:03:18.780> firing<00:03:19.780> range<00:03:19.810> that's

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:20.500 
next zombie map a firing range that's

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:23.250 
next zombie map a firing range that's
based<00:03:20.799> off<00:03:20.950> of<00:03:20.980> sog<00:03:21.750> also<00:03:22.750> so<00:03:22.870> I<00:03:22.900> think<00:03:22.989> after

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
based off of sog also so I think after

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.229 
based off of sog also so I think after
firing<00:03:24.070> range<00:03:24.430> the<00:03:24.549> next<00:03:24.790> one<00:03:24.910> is<00:03:24.970> going<00:03:25.060> to<00:03:25.150> be

00:03:25.229 --> 00:03:25.239 
firing range the next one is going to be

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:28.380 
firing range the next one is going to be
about<00:03:25.420> the<00:03:25.720> detector<00:03:26.609> which<00:03:27.609> I<00:03:27.940> believe<00:03:28.329> that

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:28.390 
about the detector which I believe that

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:30.330 
about the detector which I believe that
it's<00:03:28.690> cracked<00:03:29.109> is<00:03:29.410> the<00:03:29.560> map<00:03:29.739> based<00:03:30.010> off<00:03:30.220> the

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
it's cracked is the map based off the

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.490 
it's cracked is the map based off the
defector<00:03:30.820> and<00:03:30.940> I<00:03:31.060> believe<00:03:31.329> that<00:03:31.359> will<00:03:31.660> be<00:03:31.750> the

00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:32.500 
defector and I believe that will be the

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:36.979 
defector and I believe that will be the
next<00:03:32.769> nazi<00:03:33.220> zombies<00:03:33.519> after<00:03:33.730> the<00:03:35.190> quarantine

00:03:36.979 --> 00:03:36.989 
next nazi zombies after the quarantine

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:40.530 
next nazi zombies after the quarantine
that's<00:03:37.989> the<00:03:38.109> speculation<00:03:39.030> but<00:03:40.030> it<00:03:40.150> seems<00:03:40.359> like

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:40.540 
that's the speculation but it seems like

00:03:40.540 --> 00:03:42.930 
that's the speculation but it seems like
that's<00:03:40.750> how<00:03:40.840> I<00:03:40.870> could<00:03:41.109> do<00:03:41.260> since<00:03:41.760> three<00:03:42.760> in<00:03:42.850> a

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:42.940 
that's how I could do since three in a

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:44.849 
that's how I could do since three in a
row<00:03:42.970> I've<00:03:43.750> been<00:03:43.900> in<00:03:44.049> the<00:03:44.170> same<00:03:44.380> order<00:03:44.709> as<00:03:44.739> the

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:44.859 
row I've been in the same order as the

00:03:44.859 --> 00:03:47.640 
row I've been in the same order as the
campaign<00:03:45.280> missions<00:03:45.900> though<00:03:46.900> Fort<00:03:47.560> Monroe

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:47.650 
campaign missions though Fort Monroe

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:49.740 
campaign missions though Fort Monroe
plus<00:03:48.459> on<00:03:48.609> the<00:03:48.700> picture<00:03:49.000> for<00:03:49.180> the<00:03:49.209> defector<00:03:49.660> it

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:49.750 
plus on the picture for the defector it

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.360 
plus on the picture for the defector it
says<00:03:49.930> bottom<00:03:50.290> feeder<00:03:50.530> on<00:03:50.709> the<00:03:50.799> bottom<00:03:51.190> right

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370 
says bottom feeder on the bottom right

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:52.800 
says bottom feeder on the bottom right
which<00:03:51.640> might<00:03:51.880> have<00:03:52.030> something<00:03:52.239> to<00:03:52.329> aslam<00:03:52.660> bees

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:52.810 
which might have something to aslam bees

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:56.609 
which might have something to aslam bees
I<00:03:52.930> don't<00:03:53.230> know<00:03:53.290> just<00:03:54.190> speculation
