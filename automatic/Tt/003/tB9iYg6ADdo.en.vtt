00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.370 

this<00:00:00.690> is<00:00:00.930> showing<00:00:01.860> the<00:00:02.220> cervix<00:00:03.120> as<00:00:03.389> it<00:00:03.840> changes

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:04.380 
this is showing the cervix as it changes

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.530 
this is showing the cervix as it changes
so<00:00:04.589> here<00:00:04.890> we'd<00:00:05.040> start<00:00:05.310> out<00:00:05.400> as<00:00:05.609> one<00:00:05.640> centimeter

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
so here we'd start out as one centimeter

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.180 
so here we'd start out as one centimeter
and<00:00:07.940> that's<00:00:08.940> how<00:00:09.360> open<00:00:09.809> it<00:00:09.960> would<00:00:10.080> be<00:00:10.290> and<00:00:11.010> then

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190 
and that's how open it would be and then

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.940 
and that's how open it would be and then
2<00:00:11.580> to<00:00:11.730> 3<00:00:11.759> and<00:00:12.210> it<00:00:12.660> goes<00:00:12.840> all<00:00:13.139> the<00:00:13.170> way<00:00:13.290> up<00:00:13.500> to<00:00:13.679> 10

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
2 to 3 and it goes all the way up to 10

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.129 
2 to 3 and it goes all the way up to 10
centimeters<00:00:14.639> which<00:00:15.030> is<00:00:15.150> pretty<00:00:15.540> much<00:00:15.750> just<00:00:15.960> as

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
centimeters which is pretty much just as

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.769 
centimeters which is pretty much just as
far<00:00:16.440> as<00:00:16.560> you<00:00:16.680> can<00:00:16.859> spread<00:00:17.100> your<00:00:17.310> fingers<00:00:17.779> you

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:18.779 
far as you can spread your fingers you

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.279 
far as you can spread your fingers you
have<00:00:18.840> to<00:00:19.050> be<00:00:19.170> 10<00:00:19.470> centimeters<00:00:19.980> in<00:00:21.020> order<00:00:22.020> to

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:22.289 
have to be 10 centimeters in order to

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:23.870 
have to be 10 centimeters in order to
have<00:00:22.439> a<00:00:22.470> vaginal<00:00:22.980> birth<00:00:23.010> you<00:00:23.279> have<00:00:23.310> to<00:00:23.550> dilate

00:00:23.870 --> 00:00:23.880 
have a vaginal birth you have to dilate

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.910 
have a vaginal birth you have to dilate
fully<00:00:24.300> so<00:00:24.630> this<00:00:24.779> is<00:00:24.930> the<00:00:25.080> dilation<00:00:25.529> of<00:00:25.830> the

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:25.920 
fully so this is the dilation of the

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.279 
fully so this is the dilation of the
cervix<00:00:26.460> and<00:00:27.210> I<00:00:28.140> can<00:00:28.609> show<00:00:29.609> you<00:00:29.670> on<00:00:30.660> a<00:00:30.720> picture

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:31.289 
cervix and I can show you on a picture

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:34.670 
cervix and I can show you on a picture

be coming through here fitting through

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.369 
be coming through here fitting through
that<00:00:48.059> cervix<00:00:48.750> so<00:00:49.649> you<00:00:49.710> need<00:00:49.920> it<00:00:50.039> to<00:00:50.190> be<00:00:50.219> dilated

00:00:51.369 --> 00:00:51.379 
that cervix so you need it to be dilated

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:54.889 
that cervix so you need it to be dilated
to<00:00:52.379> go<00:00:52.559> around<00:00:52.829> that<00:00:52.920> baby's<00:00:53.370> head<00:00:53.719> so<00:00:54.719> I'll

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:01.050 
chart okay so here is um kind of another

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:03.290 
chart okay so here is um kind of another
way<00:01:01.230> to<00:01:01.289> look<00:01:01.469> at<00:01:01.620> the<00:01:01.739> cervix<00:01:02.129> so<00:01:02.850> the<00:01:02.969> cervix

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:03.300 
way to look at the cervix so the cervix

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.179 
way to look at the cervix so the cervix
is<00:01:03.449> at<00:01:03.600> the<00:01:03.719> bottom<00:01:04.199> of<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.409> uterus<00:01:04.769> it's<00:01:04.979> all

00:01:05.179 --> 00:01:05.189 
is at the bottom of the uterus it's all

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:08.899 
is at the bottom of the uterus it's all
one<00:01:06.060> piece<00:01:06.090> and<00:01:06.840> it's<00:01:07.560> very<00:01:07.799> thick<00:01:08.310> here<00:01:08.700> and

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:08.909 
one piece and it's very thick here and

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:12.170 
one piece and it's very thick here and
long<00:01:09.659> and<00:01:10.020> there's<00:01:10.470> no<00:01:10.650> dilation<00:01:11.340> here<00:01:11.610> and

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
long and there's no dilation here and

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.170 
long and there's no dilation here and
that's<00:01:12.619> keeping<00:01:13.619> the<00:01:13.799> baby<00:01:13.979> in<00:01:14.340> it's<00:01:14.790> like<00:01:14.939> the

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180 
that's keeping the baby in it's like the

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:19.310 
that's keeping the baby in it's like the
base<00:01:15.869> of<00:01:16.229> the<00:01:16.350> uterus<00:01:16.770> here<00:01:17.299> so<00:01:18.299> when<00:01:18.780> it's<00:01:18.810> um

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
base of the uterus here so when it's um

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.429 
base of the uterus here so when it's um
starting<00:01:20.009> to<00:01:20.130> dilate<00:01:20.610> you<00:01:21.600> can<00:01:21.780> see<00:01:21.960> here<00:01:22.259> this

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
starting to dilate you can see here this

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.490 
starting to dilate you can see here this
would<00:01:22.650> be<00:01:22.799> considered<00:01:23.250> like<00:01:23.840> one<00:01:24.840> to<00:01:25.200> two

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:25.500 
would be considered like one to two

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.550 
would be considered like one to two
centimeters<00:01:26.270> dilation<00:01:27.270> here<00:01:27.540> it<00:01:27.750> says<00:01:27.990> 2<00:01:28.259> to<00:01:28.380> 3

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
centimeters dilation here it says 2 to 3

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.859 
centimeters dilation here it says 2 to 3
but<00:01:28.740> that<00:01:28.920> seems<00:01:29.159> pretty<00:01:29.670> tiny<00:01:30.000> and<00:01:30.299> that's

00:01:30.859 --> 00:01:30.869 
but that seems pretty tiny and that's

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.870 
but that seems pretty tiny and that's
what<00:01:30.990> I<00:01:31.079> was<00:01:31.229> saying<00:01:31.439> here<00:01:32.040> this<00:01:32.520> is<00:01:32.700> the

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
what I was saying here this is the

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.960 
what I was saying here this is the
amount<00:01:33.060> that<00:01:33.210> it<00:01:33.450> would<00:01:33.600> be<00:01:33.720> open<00:01:34.490> so<00:01:35.490> this<00:01:35.820> is

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
amount that it would be open so this is

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:37.999 
amount that it would be open so this is
just<00:01:36.090> showing<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.540> opening<00:01:36.930> of<00:01:37.049> here<00:01:37.290> so<00:01:37.920> you

00:01:37.999 --> 00:01:38.009 
just showing the opening of here so you

00:01:38.009 --> 00:01:40.340 
just showing the opening of here so you
can<00:01:38.159> kind<00:01:38.369> of<00:01:38.400> follow<00:01:38.579> what<00:01:38.850> I<00:01:38.880> was<00:01:39.090> saying<00:01:39.350> so

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
can kind of follow what I was saying so

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:42.920 
can kind of follow what I was saying so
in<00:01:40.890> here<00:01:41.400> this<00:01:41.579> is<00:01:41.640> what's<00:01:42.210> called<00:01:42.390> the<00:01:42.540> mucous

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
in here this is what's called the mucous

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:45.050 
in here this is what's called the mucous
plug<00:01:43.110> right<00:01:43.740> in<00:01:43.920> here<00:01:44.130> where<00:01:44.250> this<00:01:44.399> purple<00:01:44.880> bit

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:45.060 
plug right in here where this purple bit

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.620 
plug right in here where this purple bit
is<00:01:45.210> so<00:01:45.960> as<00:01:46.229> the<00:01:46.619> cervix<00:01:47.549> starts<00:01:47.670> to<00:01:48.119> pull<00:01:48.360> up

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
is so as the cervix starts to pull up

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:54.350 
is so as the cervix starts to pull up
and<00:01:50.840> open<00:01:51.840> the<00:01:52.079> mucus<00:01:52.590> plug<00:01:52.799> will<00:01:53.009> come<00:01:53.159> out<00:01:53.360> so

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.360 
and open the mucus plug will come out so

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.580 
and open the mucus plug will come out so
they'll<00:01:54.540> be<00:01:54.659> could<00:01:54.899> be<00:01:55.020> a<00:01:55.049> little<00:01:55.290> bit<00:01:55.470> of

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
they'll be could be a little bit of

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.649 
they'll be could be a little bit of
bleeding<00:01:55.890> spotting<00:01:56.850> coming<00:01:57.299> from<00:01:57.479> that

00:01:57.649 --> 00:01:57.659 
bleeding spotting coming from that

00:01:57.659 --> 00:01:59.749 
bleeding spotting coming from that
that's<00:01:58.469> normal<00:01:58.950> but<00:01:59.100> you<00:01:59.219> do<00:01:59.369> want<00:01:59.549> to<00:01:59.579> tell

00:01:59.749 --> 00:01:59.759 
that's normal but you do want to tell

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.580 
that's normal but you do want to tell
your<00:01:59.939> care<00:02:00.270> provider<00:02:00.420> about<00:02:01.079> that<00:02:01.320> if<00:02:01.500> you

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
your care provider about that if you

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.060 
your care provider about that if you
have<00:02:01.619> any<00:02:02.070> bleeding<00:02:02.520> or<00:02:02.820> spotting<00:02:02.939> and<00:02:03.439> as<00:02:04.439> it

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
have any bleeding or spotting and as it

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:08.029 
have any bleeding or spotting and as it
pulls<00:02:05.340> away<00:02:05.549> more<00:02:06.030> and<00:02:06.329> opens<00:02:07.170> up<00:02:07.350> you<00:02:07.680> can<00:02:07.860> see

00:02:08.029 --> 00:02:08.039 
pulls away more and opens up you can see

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.420 
pulls away more and opens up you can see
this<00:02:08.190> is<00:02:08.399> five<00:02:08.700> to<00:02:08.910> six<00:02:09.179> centimeters

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:10.430 
this is five to six centimeters

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:12.440 
this is five to six centimeters
definitely<00:02:11.430> the<00:02:11.520> mucous<00:02:11.819> plug<00:02:11.970> is<00:02:12.209> going<00:02:12.239> to

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
definitely the mucous plug is going to

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:12.770 
definitely the mucous plug is going to
have

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
have

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.140 
have
come<00:02:12.870> out<00:02:13.020> by<00:02:13.230> now<00:02:13.410> the<00:02:14.370> waters<00:02:14.819> can<00:02:15.120> be

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
come out by now the waters can be

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:19.850 
come out by now the waters can be
bulging<00:02:15.780> or<00:02:16.220> break<00:02:17.220> at<00:02:17.490> this<00:02:17.640> point<00:02:18.590> so<00:02:19.590> here's

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
bulging or break at this point so here's

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.550 
bulging or break at this point so here's
ten<00:02:20.160> centimetres<00:02:20.880> which<00:02:21.720> is<00:02:22.550> fully<00:02:23.550> dilated

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
ten centimetres which is fully dilated

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.660 
ten centimetres which is fully dilated
which<00:02:25.560> is<00:02:25.680> what<00:02:25.830> you<00:02:25.890> need<00:02:26.040> in<00:02:26.190> order<00:02:26.310> to<00:02:26.459> have

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
which is what you need in order to have

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.990 
which is what you need in order to have
the<00:02:26.880> baby<00:02:27.090> and<00:02:27.540> it's<00:02:28.290> also<00:02:29.130> called<00:02:29.520> a<00:02:29.670> hundred

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
the baby and it's also called a hundred

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.280 
the baby and it's also called a hundred
percent<00:02:30.209> effaced

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
percent effaced

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:35.210 
percent effaced
so<00:02:31.440> effacing<00:02:32.010> is<00:02:32.840> how<00:02:33.840> thin<00:02:34.380> it<00:02:34.530> is<00:02:34.650> so<00:02:34.950> you<00:02:35.040> can

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:35.220 
so effacing is how thin it is so you can

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.300 
so effacing is how thin it is so you can
see<00:02:35.430> it's<00:02:36.090> thick<00:02:36.540> and<00:02:37.020> it<00:02:37.410> gets<00:02:37.560> thinner<00:02:37.920> and

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
see it's thick and it gets thinner and

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:42.110 
see it's thick and it gets thinner and
thinner<00:02:38.370> and<00:02:39.319> thinner<00:02:40.319> so<00:02:41.250> there's<00:02:41.489> a<00:02:41.700> couple

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:42.120 
thinner and thinner so there's a couple

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:43.729 
thinner and thinner so there's a couple
different<00:02:42.300> ways<00:02:42.600> to<00:02:42.660> measure<00:02:43.170> the<00:02:43.380> progress

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
different ways to measure the progress

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:46.729 
different ways to measure the progress
of<00:02:44.069> labour<00:02:44.310> isn't<00:02:44.880> just<00:02:45.239> the<00:02:45.420> dilation<00:02:45.840> it's

00:02:46.729 --> 00:02:46.739 
of labour isn't just the dilation it's

00:02:46.739 --> 00:02:51.140 
of labour isn't just the dilation it's
also<00:02:47.040> you<00:02:47.970> could<00:02:48.209> maybe<00:02:48.450> be<00:02:48.989> not<00:02:49.400> maybe<00:02:50.400> 2<00:02:50.790> to<00:02:50.940> 3

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
also you could maybe be not maybe 2 to 3

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.850 
also you could maybe be not maybe 2 to 3
centimeters<00:02:51.530> dilated<00:02:52.530> but<00:02:53.400> you<00:02:53.519> could<00:02:53.670> be<00:02:54.860> 50

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:55.860 
centimeters dilated but you could be 50

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:57.320 
centimeters dilated but you could be 50
60<00:02:56.250> percent<00:02:56.610> effaced

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:57.330 
60 percent effaced

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.290 
60 percent effaced
so<00:02:57.989> effacing<00:02:58.680> is<00:02:59.100> when<00:02:59.310> it<00:02:59.459> thins<00:02:59.850> like<00:03:00.060> if

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:00.300 
so effacing is when it thins like if

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:02.840 
so effacing is when it thins like if
that<00:03:00.450> was<00:03:00.510> thinner<00:03:01.019> then<00:03:01.890> that's<00:03:02.220> progress

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
that was thinner then that's progress

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:07.449 
that was thinner then that's progress
so<00:03:03.690> progress<00:03:04.530> isn't<00:03:05.010> only<00:03:05.580> measured<00:03:06.090> by

00:03:07.449 --> 00:03:07.459 
so progress isn't only measured by

00:03:07.459 --> 00:03:10.610 
so progress isn't only measured by
dilation<00:03:08.459> it's<00:03:08.850> also<00:03:09.090> how<00:03:09.390> thin<00:03:09.750> because<00:03:10.380> when

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:10.620 
dilation it's also how thin because when

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:12.320 
dilation it's also how thin because when
it<00:03:10.739> gets<00:03:10.860> really<00:03:11.130> thin<00:03:11.550> but<00:03:11.819> it<00:03:11.940> could<00:03:12.090> still

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:12.330 
it gets really thin but it could still

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:14.990 
it gets really thin but it could still
be<00:03:12.390> here<00:03:12.720> but<00:03:12.870> really<00:03:13.200> thin<00:03:13.500> a<00:03:13.850> couple<00:03:14.850> more

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
be here but really thin a couple more

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.460 
be here but really thin a couple more
contractions<00:03:15.630> and<00:03:15.810> it<00:03:15.900> can<00:03:16.050> just<00:03:16.140> pull<00:03:16.350> it

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
contractions and it can just pull it

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.740 
contractions and it can just pull it
right<00:03:16.500> up<00:03:16.700> so<00:03:17.700> you<00:03:17.760> might<00:03:18.000> be<00:03:18.150> discouraged<00:03:18.630> and

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
right up so you might be discouraged and

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.180 
right up so you might be discouraged and
here<00:03:18.930> all<00:03:19.079> you're<00:03:19.290> only<00:03:19.320> 5<00:03:19.650> centimeters

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:20.190 
here all you're only 5 centimeters

00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:22.460 
here all you're only 5 centimeters
dilated<00:03:20.459> but<00:03:21.180> you<00:03:21.299> could<00:03:21.540> be<00:03:21.660> almost<00:03:22.019> totally

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
dilated but you could be almost totally

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.430 
dilated but you could be almost totally
faced<00:03:22.920> a<00:03:23.250> couple<00:03:23.850> more<00:03:24.000> contractions<00:03:24.570> you're

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:25.440 
faced a couple more contractions you're

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.130 
faced a couple more contractions you're
at<00:03:25.560> 7<00:03:25.980> 8<00:03:26.160> centimeters<00:03:26.790> so<00:03:27.540> those<00:03:27.780> are<00:03:27.959> just

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:28.140 
at 7 8 centimeters so those are just

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:32.210 
at 7 8 centimeters so those are just
different<00:03:28.799> ways<00:03:29.040> of<00:03:29.340> measuring<00:03:29.610> progress<00:03:31.220> so

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220 
different ways of measuring progress so

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.870 
different ways of measuring progress so
this<00:03:32.640> diagram<00:03:33.239> shows<00:03:33.709> what's<00:03:34.709> called<00:03:35.010> in<00:03:35.280> the

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
this diagram shows what's called in the

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.930 
this diagram shows what's called in the
head<00:03:36.060> being<00:03:36.299> engaged<00:03:36.750> or<00:03:37.110> lightening<00:03:37.680> so<00:03:38.549> the

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940 
head being engaged or lightening so the

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.860 
head being engaged or lightening so the
baby<00:03:39.299> is<00:03:39.650> floating<00:03:40.650> up<00:03:40.829> quite<00:03:41.489> high<00:03:41.850> here<00:03:42.239> you

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:42.870 
baby is floating up quite high here you

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:45.440 
baby is floating up quite high here you
can<00:03:43.079> see<00:03:43.320> there's<00:03:43.890> lots<00:03:44.670> of<00:03:44.880> room<00:03:45.060> for<00:03:45.090> the

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:45.450 
can see there's lots of room for the

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:49.940 
can see there's lots of room for the
bladder<00:03:45.750> and<00:03:47.660> not<00:03:48.660> not<00:03:48.930> much<00:03:49.140> as<00:03:49.380> being<00:03:49.620> kind

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:49.950 
bladder and not not much as being kind

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:52.250 
bladder and not not much as being kind
of<00:03:50.070> squished<00:03:50.430> in<00:03:50.609> the<00:03:50.730> lower<00:03:50.910> part<00:03:51.329> but<00:03:52.079> when

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:52.260 
of squished in the lower part but when

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.550 
of squished in the lower part but when
the<00:03:52.410> baby<00:03:52.620> goes<00:03:53.220> it<00:03:53.910> head<00:03:54.299> becomes<00:03:54.630> engaged<00:03:55.230> in

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
the baby goes it head becomes engaged in

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.550 
the baby goes it head becomes engaged in
the<00:03:55.650> pelvis<00:03:55.829> that<00:03:56.310> means<00:03:56.459> it<00:03:56.640> goes<00:03:57.120> down<00:03:57.630> you

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
the pelvis that means it goes down you

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.220 
the pelvis that means it goes down you
can<00:03:58.709> see<00:03:58.890> how<00:03:58.980> there's<00:03:59.190> more<00:03:59.549> room<00:04:00.540> up<00:04:00.780> top

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:01.230 
can see how there's more room up top

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:05.090 
can see how there's more room up top
here<00:04:01.650> as<00:04:01.920> opposed<00:04:02.310> to<00:04:02.459> here<00:04:02.519> and<00:04:03.799> less<00:04:04.799> room

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:05.100 
here as opposed to here and less room

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:06.710 
here as opposed to here and less room
down<00:04:05.370> below<00:04:05.670> this<00:04:05.850> one<00:04:06.060> you<00:04:06.150> have<00:04:06.299> to<00:04:06.390> go<00:04:06.510> pee

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
down below this one you have to go pee

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:07.340 
down below this one you have to go pee
all<00:04:06.930> the<00:04:06.959> time

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:07.350 
all the time

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:09.050 
all the time
because<00:04:07.709> your<00:04:07.859> bladders<00:04:08.190> being<00:04:08.430> squished<00:04:08.730> and

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:09.060 
because your bladders being squished and

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:12.530 
because your bladders being squished and
the<00:04:09.900> cervix<00:04:10.290> has<00:04:10.350> now<00:04:10.820> gotten<00:04:11.820> shorter<00:04:12.359> in

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
the cervix has now gotten shorter in

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.840 
the cervix has now gotten shorter in
this<00:04:12.690> picture<00:04:13.049> and<00:04:13.290> you<00:04:13.920> can<00:04:14.070> see<00:04:14.280> the

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:14.850 
this picture and you can see the

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:17.330 
this picture and you can see the
difference<00:04:15.480> so<00:04:15.750> this<00:04:15.930> is<00:04:16.049> called<00:04:16.320> they<00:04:17.160> had

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340 
difference so this is called they had

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.729 
difference so this is called they had
been<00:04:17.519> engaged<00:04:17.940> or<00:04:18.359> lightening<00:04:18.900> and<00:04:19.169> you<00:04:19.560> just

have you just feel like you've got more
room<00:04:22.530> here<00:04:22.560> and<00:04:23.010> more<00:04:23.130> pressure<00:04:23.430> down<00:04:23.729> here

00:04:23.750 --> 00:04:23.760 
room here and more pressure down here

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.610 
room here and more pressure down here
when<00:04:24.570> when<00:04:24.900> the<00:04:25.020> baby's<00:04:25.349> head<00:04:25.890> drops<00:04:26.159> into<00:04:26.400> the

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:26.620 
when when the baby's head drops into the

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:31.950 
when when the baby's head drops into the
pelvis<00:04:28.470> so<00:04:29.470> another<00:04:29.770> way<00:04:29.949> that<00:04:30.570> the<00:04:31.570> progress

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:31.960 
pelvis so another way that the progress

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:34.560 
pelvis so another way that the progress
is<00:04:32.320> measured<00:04:32.530> is<00:04:32.979> not<00:04:33.220> only<00:04:33.639> you<00:04:34.419> know<00:04:34.449> the

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:34.570 
is measured is not only you know the

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:38.820 
is measured is not only you know the
dilation<00:04:35.169> any<00:04:36.040> facing<00:04:36.729> but<00:04:37.330> station<00:04:37.990> station

00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:38.830 
dilation any facing but station station

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:41.370 
dilation any facing but station station
is<00:04:39.100> marked<00:04:39.460> by<00:04:39.550> the<00:04:39.699> ischial<00:04:40.180> spines<00:04:40.540> here<00:04:41.199> in

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:41.380 
is marked by the ischial spines here in

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:44.580 
is marked by the ischial spines here in
your<00:04:41.500> pelvis<00:04:41.949> and<00:04:42.360> where<00:04:43.360> the<00:04:43.660> head<00:04:43.960> is<00:04:44.260> in

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.590 
your pelvis and where the head is in

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:47.159 
your pelvis and where the head is in
relationship<00:04:45.100> to<00:04:45.280> those<00:04:45.639> so<00:04:46.540> if<00:04:46.690> the<00:04:46.840> head<00:04:47.020> is

00:04:47.159 --> 00:04:47.169 
relationship to those so if the head is

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:51.900 
relationship to those so if the head is
above<00:04:47.530> if<00:04:47.979> it's<00:04:48.910> in<00:04:49.090> line<00:04:49.419> with<00:04:49.660> them
