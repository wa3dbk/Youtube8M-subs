seven point five frames I convert

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:32.030 
seven point five frames I convert
everything<00:01:29.850> to<00:01:30.030> frames<00:01:30.509> and<00:01:30.840> subtract<00:01:31.590> the

everything to frames and subtract the

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:38.100 
divide the difference by the no mask

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.920 
divide the difference by the no mask
average<00:01:38.790> and<00:01:39.030> get<00:01:39.299> an<00:01:39.420> effective<00:01:39.840> level<00:01:40.439> of

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:41.930 
average and get an effective level of

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:47.630 
average and get an effective level of
90.4<00:01:42.930> percent<00:01:44.119> yeah<00:01:45.200> the<00:01:46.200> second<00:01:46.680> test<00:01:47.159> will

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
90.4 percent yeah the second test will

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:53.270 
90.4 percent yeah the second test will
be<00:01:47.790> flash<00:01:48.240> grenades<00:01:48.750> I<00:01:50.960> toss<00:01:51.960> one<00:01:52.259> time<00:01:52.920> it<00:01:53.100> and

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:53.280 
be flash grenades I toss one time it and

the<00:02:32.680> no<00:02:32.890> mask<00:02:33.220> result<00:02:33.790> i<00:02:34.060> divide<00:02:34.900> the

00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:35.080 
the no mask result i divide the

the no mask result i divide the

difference by the no mask average and

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:42.020 
difference by the no mask average and
get<00:02:37.750> an<00:02:37.840> effective<00:02:38.230> level<00:02:38.650> of<00:02:39.450> 90.1<00:02:40.450> percent

yeah<00:02:43.110> you<00:02:44.110> want<00:02:44.290> to<00:02:44.410> guess<00:02:44.560> what<00:02:44.650> the<00:02:44.769> shock

00:02:45.059 --> 00:02:45.069 
yeah you want to guess what the shock

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:46.530 
yeah you want to guess what the shock

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:46.540 
charge percentage is going to be like

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.750 
charge percentage is going to be like
well<00:02:47.470> don't<00:02:47.680> because<00:02:47.950> it's<00:02:48.190> not<00:02:48.370> ninety

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:48.760
