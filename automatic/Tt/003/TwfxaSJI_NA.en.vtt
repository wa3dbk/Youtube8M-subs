what<00:01:49.069> he<00:01:49.130> does<00:01:49.249> after<00:01:49.429> that<00:01:49.700> combat<00:01:50.090> father

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:50.270 
what he does after that combat father

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:52.179 
what he does after that combat father
unsurprisingly<00:01:51.020> coming<00:01:51.289> out<00:01:51.409> full<00:01:51.649> mechanic

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:52.189 
unsurprisingly coming out full mechanic

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:54.399 
unsurprisingly coming out full mechanic
after<00:01:52.490> the<00:01:52.579> first<00:01:52.849> engineer<00:01:53.420> and<00:01:53.659> that<00:01:54.170> first

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:54.409 
after the first engineer and that first

after the first engineer and that first
kid<00:01:54.649> is<00:01:54.740> going<00:01:54.859> to<00:01:54.950> walk<00:01:55.039> straight<00:01:55.249> in<00:01:55.369> Matty's

turns<00:01:55.969> away<00:01:56.090> immediately<00:01:56.479> and<00:01:57.079> so<00:01:58.069> he

00:01:58.239 --> 00:01:58.249 
turns away immediately and so he

00:01:58.249 --> 00:02:00.069 
turns away immediately and so he
probably<00:01:58.670> hasn't<00:01:59.119> been<00:01:59.270> seen<00:01:59.659> here<00:01:59.719> by

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:00.079 
probably hasn't been seen here by

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:02.289 
probably hasn't been seen here by
mechanic<00:02:00.709> I<00:02:00.979> think<00:02:01.490> he<00:02:01.579> might<00:02:01.700> do<00:02:01.909> that<00:02:01.939> just

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:02.299 
mechanic I think he might do that just

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:03.760 
mechanic I think he might do that just
out<00:02:02.479> of<00:02:02.630> range<00:02:02.719> mechanic<00:02:03.229> might<00:02:03.409> have<00:02:03.529> spotted

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:03.770 
out of range mechanic might have spotted

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.010 
out of range mechanic might have spotted
it<00:02:03.979> for<00:02:04.130> a<00:02:04.159> second<00:02:04.549> there<00:02:04.729> but<00:02:05.689> he's<00:02:05.810> at<00:02:05.929> least

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:06.020 
it for a second there but he's at least

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:07.989 
it for a second there but he's at least
saved<00:02:06.349> that<00:02:06.499> skid<00:02:06.770> Rankin<00:02:07.159> and<00:02:07.189> can<00:02:07.729> dodge

00:02:07.989 --> 00:02:07.999 
saved that skid Rankin and can dodge

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:09.609 
saved that skid Rankin and can dodge
around<00:02:08.300> and<00:02:08.569> get<00:02:08.660> as<00:02:08.750> much<00:02:08.869> into<00:02:09.200> as<00:02:09.319> he<00:02:09.410> can

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:09.619 
around and get as much into as he can

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:11.350 
around and get as much into as he can
see<00:02:09.800> sees<00:02:10.039> the<00:02:10.190> commander<00:02:10.610> there<00:02:10.789> looking

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:11.360 
see sees the commander there looking

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:12.910 
see sees the commander there looking
from<00:02:11.659> mechanics<00:02:12.200> point<00:02:12.379> of<00:02:12.470> view<00:02:12.590> he<00:02:12.680> doesn't

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:12.920 
from mechanics point of view he doesn't

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:14.500 
from mechanics point of view he doesn't
see<00:02:13.040> anything<00:02:13.250> as<00:02:13.549> of<00:02:13.670> yet

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510 
see anything as of yet

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:15.820 
see anything as of yet
I<00:02:14.599> think<00:02:15.170> he's<00:02:15.290> managed<00:02:15.530> to<00:02:15.560> remain

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
I think he's managed to remain

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.089 
I think he's managed to remain
undetected<00:02:16.040> for<00:02:16.519> now<00:02:17.170> I'm<00:02:18.170> gonna<00:02:18.409> see<00:02:18.620> so

00:02:19.089 --> 00:02:19.099 
undetected for now I'm gonna see so

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:20.860 
undetected for now I'm gonna see so
again<00:02:19.370> the<00:02:19.640> the<00:02:20.209> one<00:02:20.390> interesting<00:02:20.840> detail

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:20.870 
again the the one interesting detail

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.550 
again the the one interesting detail
here<00:02:21.470> is<00:02:22.370> that<00:02:23.049> Matisse<00:02:24.049> isn't<00:02:24.379> doing<00:02:24.530> the

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:24.560 
here is that Matisse isn't doing the

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.080 
here is that Matisse isn't doing the
super<00:02:24.799> aggressive<00:02:25.370> version<00:02:25.640> of<00:02:25.760> this<00:02:25.849> bill

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:26.090 
super aggressive version of this bill

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:27.460 
super aggressive version of this bill
right<00:02:26.329> the<00:02:26.450> super<00:02:26.750> aggressive<00:02:27.110> version

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:27.470 
right the super aggressive version

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:28.960 
right the super aggressive version
revolves<00:02:27.769> two<00:02:27.950> or<00:02:28.069> even<00:02:28.099> three<00:02:28.280> vehicle

00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:28.970 
revolves two or even three vehicle

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:30.850 
revolves two or even three vehicle
factories<00:02:29.420> he's<00:02:29.959> just<00:02:30.110> going<00:02:30.290> to<00:02:30.349> go<00:02:30.470> for<00:02:30.650> one

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:30.860 
factories he's just going to go for one

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:32.920 
factories he's just going to go for one
to<00:02:31.819> send<00:02:32.030> out<00:02:32.120> some<00:02:32.239> of<00:02:32.329> that<00:02:32.360> bought<00:02:32.629> her<00:02:32.780> ass

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
to send out some of that bought her ass

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:34.839 
to send out some of that bought her ass
and<00:02:33.709> he's<00:02:33.980> probably<00:02:34.190> going<00:02:34.370> to<00:02:34.430> see<00:02:34.579> if<00:02:34.670> he<00:02:34.730> can

00:02:34.839 --> 00:02:34.849 
and he's probably going to see if he can

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:37.059 
and he's probably going to see if he can
pick<00:02:35.090> off<00:02:35.209> a<00:02:35.239> combat<00:02:35.629> fabric<00:02:35.930> or<00:02:36.019> two<00:02:36.200> and

00:02:37.059 --> 00:02:37.069 
pick off a combat fabric or two and

00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:38.350 
pick off a combat fabric or two and
that's<00:02:37.220> going<00:02:37.459> to<00:02:37.519> be<00:02:37.610> all<00:02:37.760> that<00:02:37.970> he's<00:02:38.150> going

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:38.360 
that's going to be all that he's going

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.420 
that's going to be all that he's going
for<00:02:38.629> he<00:02:39.140> does<00:02:39.290> bring<00:02:39.409> out<00:02:39.560> an<00:02:39.709> air<00:02:39.829> factory<00:02:40.310> is

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:40.430 
for he does bring out an air factory is

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:41.559 
for he does bring out an air factory is
we're<00:02:40.549> going<00:02:40.640> to<00:02:40.700> start<00:02:40.909> building<00:02:41.329> the

00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:41.569 
we're going to start building the

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:43.270 
we're going to start building the
Bombers<00:02:41.989> but<00:02:42.709> that's<00:02:42.859> not<00:02:42.920> going<00:02:43.069> to<00:02:43.159> be<00:02:43.190> a

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:43.280 
Bombers but that's not going to be a

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:44.740 
Bombers but that's not going to be a
less<00:02:43.430> effective<00:02:43.879> from<00:02:44.030> a<00:02:44.090> per<00:02:44.239> ass<00:02:44.390> because

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:44.750 
less effective from a per ass because

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.179 
less effective from a per ass because
mechanic<00:02:45.260> is<00:02:45.409> putting<00:02:45.739> up<00:02:45.799> his<00:02:45.890> own<00:02:46.040> air

00:02:46.179 --> 00:02:46.189 
mechanic is putting up his own air

mechanic is putting up his own air
factory<00:02:46.640> he's<00:02:47.060> probably<00:02:47.180> going<00:02:47.420> to<00:02:47.510> get<00:02:47.569> out

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 
factory he's probably going to get out

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:49.930 
factory he's probably going to get out
fighters<00:02:48.049> fairly<00:02:48.530> quickly<00:02:48.940> actually

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940 
fighters fairly quickly actually

fighters fairly quickly actually
starting<00:02:50.180> with<00:02:50.269> a<00:02:50.299> bomber<00:02:50.569> as<00:02:50.810> well<00:02:51.019> so

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:51.739 
starting with a bomber as well so

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:53.649 
starting with a bomber as well so
mechanic<00:02:52.220> going<00:02:52.370> for<00:02:52.549> a<00:02:52.579> similar<00:02:52.849> thing<00:02:53.090> what

00:02:53.649 --> 00:02:53.659 
mechanic going for a similar thing what

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:55.300 
mechanic going for a similar thing what
kind<00:02:53.840> of<00:02:53.870> cool<00:02:53.989> so<00:02:54.170> just<00:02:54.349> build<00:02:54.500> a<00:02:54.590> radar<00:02:54.980> so<00:02:55.190> he

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
kind of cool so just build a radar so he

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:56.619 
kind of cool so just build a radar so he
sees<00:02:55.489> these<00:02:55.639> two<00:02:55.879> units<00:02:56.209> right<00:02:56.329> around<00:02:56.510> the

sees these two units right around the
outside<00:02:56.989> you<00:02:57.109> can<00:02:57.260> also<00:02:57.379> see<00:02:57.590> by<00:02:57.709> the<00:02:57.769> speed

00:02:58.030 --> 00:02:58.040 
outside you can also see by the speed

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.170 
outside you can also see by the speed
they're<00:02:58.220> moving<00:02:58.519> that<00:02:58.639> almost<00:02:58.819> certainly

they're moving that almost certainly
skitters<00:02:59.629> and<00:02:59.829> you<00:03:00.829> can<00:03:00.950> actually<00:03:01.069> see<00:03:01.280> on<00:03:01.579> the

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:01.700 
skitters and you can actually see on the

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.610 
skitters and you can actually see on the
corner<00:03:01.970> of<00:03:02.000> his<00:03:02.090> radar<00:03:02.329> to<00:03:02.599> the<00:03:02.780> right<00:03:03.409> hand

side of this base is something moving
slow<00:03:05.209> enough<00:03:05.389> it's<00:03:05.540> got<00:03:05.720> to<00:03:05.810> be<00:03:05.870> an<00:03:05.959> aunt<00:03:06.170> and

00:03:06.369 --> 00:03:06.379 
slow enough it's got to be an aunt and

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:08.259 
slow enough it's got to be an aunt and

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:08.269 
now that incoming air unit as well Mike

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:09.520 
now that incoming air unit as well Mike
and<00:03:08.450> it's<00:03:08.569> got<00:03:08.659> to<00:03:08.750> realize<00:03:08.959> he's<00:03:09.109> in<00:03:09.200> a<00:03:09.260> little

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:09.530 
and it's got to realize he's in a little

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:11.229 
and it's got to realize he's in a little
bit<00:03:09.620> of<00:03:09.650> trouble<00:03:09.849> he's<00:03:10.849> going<00:03:10.940> to<00:03:11.000> be<00:03:11.090> under

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:11.239 
bit of trouble he's going to be under

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:12.789 
bit of trouble he's going to be under
some<00:03:11.359> early<00:03:11.629> rating<00:03:11.930> from<00:03:12.079> the<00:03:12.170> radar<00:03:12.590> you<00:03:12.680> can

00:03:12.789 --> 00:03:12.799 
some early rating from the radar you can

00:03:12.799 --> 00:03:14.800 
some early rating from the radar you can
pretty<00:03:13.010> much<00:03:13.099> tell<00:03:13.340> exactly<00:03:13.400> where<00:03:14.060> the<00:03:14.599> tease

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
pretty much tell exactly where the tease

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:16.990 
pretty much tell exactly where the tease
is<00:03:14.840> right<00:03:15.230> now<00:03:15.379> the<00:03:16.190> singer<00:03:16.519> the<00:03:16.670> combat

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:17.000 
is right now the singer the combat

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.729 
is right now the singer the combat
fabric<00:03:17.299> both<00:03:17.480> in<00:03:17.629> the<00:03:17.720> same<00:03:17.930> place<00:03:18.170> get<00:03:18.530> sniped

00:03:18.729 --> 00:03:18.739 
fabric both in the same place get sniped

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:19.960 
fabric both in the same place get sniped
at<00:03:18.919> once<00:03:19.099> that's<00:03:19.280> gonna<00:03:19.400> get<00:03:19.549> rid<00:03:19.639> of<00:03:19.699> the<00:03:19.790> air

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:19.970 
at once that's gonna get rid of the air

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:21.610 
at once that's gonna get rid of the air
defense<00:03:20.329> for<00:03:20.540> mechanic<00:03:20.959> which<00:03:21.109> means<00:03:21.290> the<00:03:21.410> t's

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:21.620 
defense for mechanic which means the t's

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:24.430 
defense for mechanic which means the t's
has<00:03:21.799> free<00:03:22.160> rein<00:03:22.370> with<00:03:22.400> this<00:03:22.669> bomber<00:03:22.940> um<00:03:23.720> yeah

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 
has free rein with this bomber um yeah

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.439 
has free rein with this bomber um yeah
he<00:03:24.680> should<00:03:24.949> be<00:03:24.980> turning<00:03:25.280> it<00:03:25.459> around<00:03:25.549> to<00:03:25.940> try

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:26.449 
he should be turning it around to try

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:28.839 
he should be turning it around to try
and<00:03:26.690> take<00:03:26.840> out<00:03:27.049> the<00:03:27.109> the<00:03:28.010> fabricator<00:03:28.609> as<00:03:28.699> well

00:03:28.839 --> 00:03:28.849 
and take out the the fabricator as well

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:30.159 
and take out the the fabricator as well
doesn't<00:03:29.060> look<00:03:29.150> like<00:03:29.329> he's<00:03:29.480> done<00:03:29.660> that<00:03:29.780> yet<00:03:29.989> I

00:03:30.159 --> 00:03:30.169 
doesn't look like he's done that yet I

00:03:30.169 --> 00:03:31.210 
doesn't look like he's done that yet I
guess<00:03:30.530> he's<00:03:30.560> still<00:03:30.709> worried<00:03:31.010> about<00:03:31.099> the

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:31.220 
guess he's still worried about the

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:32.470 
guess he's still worried about the
airiness<00:03:31.519> doesn't<00:03:31.819> realize<00:03:32.000> how<00:03:32.090> much<00:03:32.269> damage

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:32.480 
airiness doesn't realize how much damage

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.780 
airiness doesn't realize how much damage
he's<00:03:32.690> done<00:03:32.720> the<00:03:33.290> fighter<00:03:33.560> is<00:03:33.769> there<00:03:34.099> now<00:03:34.280> so

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
he's done the fighter is there now so

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.230 
losing that combat fabricator this early

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:45.220

00:03:46.809 --> 00:03:46.819 
to be the single and here and it's going

00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:48.699 
to be the single and here and it's going
to<00:03:46.910> be<00:03:46.970> merely<00:03:47.180> uncontested<00:03:47.989> the<00:03:48.349> commander

00:03:48.699 --> 00:03:48.709 
to be merely uncontested the commander

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:49.720 
to be merely uncontested the commander
is<00:03:48.769> starting<00:03:49.010> to<00:03:49.069> move<00:03:49.129> north<00:03:49.280> to<00:03:49.400> counter<00:03:49.699> it

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:49.730 
is starting to move north to counter it

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:51.280 
is starting to move north to counter it
but<00:03:49.879> it's<00:03:49.970> gonna<00:03:50.060> get<00:03:50.209> a<00:03:50.269> very<00:03:50.690> least<00:03:50.900> pick<00:03:51.139> off

00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:51.290 
but it's gonna get a very least pick off

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:53.140 
but it's gonna get a very least pick off
this<00:03:51.410> radar<00:03:51.680> know<00:03:51.980> it's<00:03:52.549> going<00:03:52.910> to<00:03:53.000> start

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.150 
this radar know it's going to start

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:55.000 
this radar know it's going to start
targeting<00:03:53.690> the<00:03:54.019> mechs<00:03:54.199> but<00:03:54.650> yeah<00:03:54.739> so<00:03:54.919> this

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:55.010 
targeting the mechs but yeah so this

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:57.670 
targeting the mechs but yeah so this
this<00:03:55.340> bolo<00:03:56.090> her<00:03:56.299> ass<00:03:56.449> here<00:03:56.750> is<00:03:57.169> going<00:03:57.409> to<00:03:57.530> start

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:57.680 
this bolo her ass here is going to start

00:03:57.680 --> 00:03:58.869 
this bolo her ass here is going to start
doing<00:03:57.709> some<00:03:58.040> damage<00:03:58.190> here<00:03:58.340> and<00:03:58.549> it's<00:03:58.639> going<00:03:58.760> to

00:03:58.869 --> 00:03:58.879 
doing some damage here and it's going to

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:00.610 
doing some damage here and it's going to
force<00:03:59.060> the<00:03:59.419> mechanic<00:03:59.840> to<00:03:59.989> react<00:04:00.379> with<00:04:00.500> his

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:00.620 
force the mechanic to react with his

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:02.890 
force the mechanic to react with his
commander<00:04:01.090> yeah<00:04:02.090> this<00:04:02.329> is<00:04:02.449> a<00:04:02.480> pretty<00:04:02.569> big

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:02.900 
commander yeah this is a pretty big

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:04.330 
commander yeah this is a pretty big
disadvantage<00:04:03.199> for<00:04:03.500> mechanic<00:04:03.889> he<00:04:03.980> also<00:04:04.099> lost

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:04.340 
disadvantage for mechanic he also lost

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:06.369 
disadvantage for mechanic he also lost
that<00:04:04.549> engineer<00:04:05.000> there<00:04:05.180> as<00:04:05.299> well<00:04:05.540> so<00:04:05.569> really

00:04:06.369 --> 00:04:06.379 
that engineer there as well so really

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:07.689 
that engineer there as well so really
pretty<00:04:06.560> far<00:04:06.799> behind<00:04:06.919> going<00:04:07.250> to<00:04:07.340> affect<00:04:07.579> his

00:04:07.689 --> 00:04:07.699 
pretty far behind going to affect his

00:04:07.699 --> 00:04:09.099 
pretty far behind going to affect his
build<00:04:07.970> order<00:04:08.090> with<00:04:08.359> what<00:04:08.510> he<00:04:08.599> initially

00:04:09.099 --> 00:04:09.109 
build order with what he initially

00:04:09.109 --> 00:04:11.379 
build order with what he initially
planned<00:04:09.620> and<00:04:10.549> now<00:04:10.669> going<00:04:10.849> to<00:04:10.909> come<00:04:11.030> under<00:04:11.239> her

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:11.389 
planned and now going to come under her

00:04:11.389 --> 00:04:12.819 
planned and now going to come under her
ass<00:04:11.419> luckily<00:04:11.900> the<00:04:12.079> commander<00:04:12.409> does<00:04:12.560> manage<00:04:12.799> to

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:12.829 
ass luckily the commander does manage to

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:15.369 
ass luckily the commander does manage to
pick<00:04:13.069> off<00:04:13.220> there's<00:04:13.430> two<00:04:13.669> t1<00:04:14.090> tanks<00:04:14.540> before

00:04:15.369 --> 00:04:15.379 
pick off there's two t1 tanks before

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:16.750 
pick off there's two t1 tanks before
they<00:04:15.650> manage<00:04:15.859> to<00:04:15.889> do<00:04:16.039> some<00:04:16.220> damage<00:04:16.400> so<00:04:16.699> it

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:16.760 
they manage to do some damage so it

00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:18.129 
they manage to do some damage so it
wasn't<00:04:17.000> completely<00:04:17.329> wasted<00:04:17.720> time<00:04:17.870> moving

00:04:18.129 --> 00:04:18.139 
wasn't completely wasted time moving

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:19.599 
wasn't completely wasted time moving
that<00:04:18.289> commander<00:04:18.709> now<00:04:19.130> I'm<00:04:19.220> gonna<00:04:19.310> try<00:04:19.459> and<00:04:19.549> get

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:19.609 
that commander now I'm gonna try and get

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:21.189 
that commander now I'm gonna try and get
out<00:04:19.729> more<00:04:19.849> factories<00:04:20.239> Nico<00:04:20.570> realizes<00:04:21.049> he's

00:04:21.189 --> 00:04:21.199 
out more factories Nico realizes he's

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:22.629 
out more factories Nico realizes he's
got<00:04:21.380> a<00:04:21.409> switch<00:04:21.680> up<00:04:21.859> his<00:04:21.979> build<00:04:22.250> here<00:04:22.430> so<00:04:22.520> if<00:04:22.580> he

00:04:22.629 --> 00:04:22.639 
got a switch up his build here so if he

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:24.190 
got a switch up his build here so if he
doesn't<00:04:22.880> get<00:04:22.940> our<00:04:23.060> factories<00:04:23.510> and<00:04:23.960> get<00:04:24.080> out

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:24.200 
doesn't get our factories and get out

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.500 
doesn't get our factories and get out
units<00:04:24.650> then<00:04:25.370> he<00:04:25.520> will<00:04:25.669> lose<00:04:25.909> to<00:04:25.969> the<00:04:26.270> rush

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:26.510 
units then he will lose to the rush

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:28.060 
units then he will lose to the rush

now getting up some more of those
factories<00:04:31.550> so<00:04:31.669> I'm<00:04:31.790> not<00:04:31.940> sure<00:04:32.120> whether<00:04:32.270> Zico

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:32.630 
factories so I'm not sure whether Zico

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:35.230 
factories so I'm not sure whether Zico
really<00:04:32.900> be<00:04:32.990> able<00:04:33.080> to<00:04:33.260> support<00:04:34.250> it<00:04:34.639> without<00:04:34.790> too

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:35.240 
really be able to support it without too

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:37.060 
really be able to support it without too
much<00:04:35.419> metal<00:04:35.750> at<00:04:35.960> this<00:04:36.110> stage<00:04:36.380> he's<00:04:36.889> definitely

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:37.070 
much metal at this stage he's definitely

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:38.680 
much metal at this stage he's definitely
behind<00:04:37.370> matey's<00:04:37.790> at<00:04:37.910> the<00:04:37.970> moment<00:04:38.270> but<00:04:38.360> matey's

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:38.690 
behind matey's at the moment but matey's

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:40.420 
behind matey's at the moment but matey's
doesn't<00:04:38.990> have<00:04:39.110> super<00:04:39.590> amounts<00:04:39.740> of<00:04:39.949> production

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:40.430 
doesn't have super amounts of production

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:41.920 
doesn't have super amounts of production
so<00:04:40.669> he<00:04:40.880> definitely<00:04:41.090> needs<00:04:41.330> to<00:04:41.419> catch<00:04:41.690> up<00:04:41.840> on

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:41.930 
so he definitely needs to catch up on

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:43.840 
so he definitely needs to catch up on
that<00:04:42.080> from<00:04:42.320> you<00:04:42.740> can't<00:04:43.340> even<00:04:43.490> really<00:04:43.580> call<00:04:43.790> a

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:43.850 
that from you can't even really call a

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:45.520 
that from you can't even really call a
rush<00:04:44.120> strat<00:04:44.419> I<00:04:44.540> mean<00:04:44.720> he<00:04:44.810> did<00:04:44.960> go<00:04:45.110> for<00:04:45.169> some

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:45.530 
rush strat I mean he did go for some

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:46.960 
rush strat I mean he did go for some
aggression<00:04:46.100> first<00:04:46.460> but<00:04:46.699> really<00:04:46.880> he<00:04:46.940> just

00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:46.970 
aggression first but really he just

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:49.629 
aggression first but really he just
replaced<00:04:47.330> the<00:04:47.479> Grenadiers<00:04:47.990> with<00:04:48.889> bolos<00:04:49.400> and

00:04:49.629 --> 00:04:49.639 
replaced the Grenadiers with bolos and

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:53.050 
replaced the Grenadiers with bolos and
now<00:04:49.880> actually<00:04:50.479> has<00:04:51.110> a<00:04:51.139> lot<00:04:51.410> more<00:04:51.560> eco<00:04:51.949> out<00:04:52.610> that

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:53.060 
now actually has a lot more eco out that

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:54.939 
now actually has a lot more eco out that
mechanic<00:04:53.660> wears<00:04:53.930> mechanic<00:04:54.410> at<00:04:54.530> this<00:04:54.650> point<00:04:54.889> is

00:04:54.939 --> 00:04:54.949 
mechanic wears mechanic at this point is

00:04:54.949 --> 00:04:57.129 
mechanic wears mechanic at this point is
actually<00:04:55.280> had<00:04:55.400> on<00:04:55.490> production<00:04:56.030> so<00:04:56.900> that<00:04:56.930> is

00:04:57.129 --> 00:04:57.139 
actually had on production so that is

00:04:57.139 --> 00:04:58.360 
actually had on production so that is
going<00:04:57.320> to<00:04:57.410> impact<00:04:57.650> how<00:04:57.770> this<00:04:58.010> game<00:04:58.130> goes<00:04:58.190> a

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:58.370 
going to impact how this game goes a

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:02.230 
going to impact how this game goes a
little<00:04:58.729> bit<00:05:00.280> Matisse<00:05:01.280> did<00:05:01.550> have<00:05:01.700> this<00:05:01.940> one

00:05:02.230 --> 00:05:02.240 
little bit Matisse did have this one

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:04.000

production<00:05:10.010> from<00:05:10.100> mechanic<00:05:10.870> but<00:05:11.870> now<00:05:11.960> this

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:12.080 
production from mechanic but now this

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:15.340 
production from mechanic but now this
production<00:05:12.560> is<00:05:12.650> here<00:05:12.979> and<00:05:13.970> out<00:05:14.360> we're<00:05:15.260> going

00:05:26.439 --> 00:05:26.449 
back unfortunately moving north if he

00:05:26.449 --> 00:05:27.700 
back unfortunately moving north if he
didn't<00:05:26.600> manage<00:05:26.780> to<00:05:26.810> stay<00:05:27.169> around<00:05:27.380> the<00:05:27.500> back

didn't manage to stay around the back

00:05:27.710 --> 00:05:29.020 
didn't manage to stay around the back
and<00:05:27.889> just<00:05:28.010> take<00:05:28.190> out<00:05:28.340> a<00:05:28.400> single<00:05:28.610> one<00:05:28.850> those

00:05:29.020 --> 00:05:29.030 
and just take out a single one those

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:30.219 
and just take out a single one those
mixed<00:05:29.330> I<00:05:29.389> really<00:05:29.600> would<00:05:29.720> have<00:05:29.810> fighting

00:05:30.219 --> 00:05:30.229

00:05:30.229 --> 00:05:33.310 
mixed I really would have fighting
mechanics<00:05:30.500> eco<00:05:30.949> quite<00:05:31.220> a<00:05:31.250> bit<00:05:31.520> and<00:05:31.690> and<00:05:32.690> taken

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:33.320 
mechanics eco quite a bit and and taken

00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:34.390 
mechanics eco quite a bit and and taken
out<00:05:33.380> just<00:05:33.590> a<00:05:33.650> single<00:05:33.860> max<00:05:34.100> would<00:05:34.220> have<00:05:34.310> been

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:34.400 
out just a single max would have been

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:35.890 
out just a single max would have been
ten<00:05:34.610> percent<00:05:34.850> of<00:05:34.940> his<00:05:35.030> total<00:05:35.330> medal<00:05:35.600> income

00:05:35.890 --> 00:05:35.900 
ten percent of his total medal income

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:38.200 
ten percent of his total medal income
and<00:05:36.110> but<00:05:36.979> it<00:05:37.160> looks<00:05:37.340> like<00:05:37.400> he's<00:05:37.610> now<00:05:37.820> heading<00:05:38.030> a

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:38.210 
and but it looks like he's now heading a

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:40.180 
and but it looks like he's now heading a
bit<00:05:38.360> further<00:05:38.539> south<00:05:38.840> of<00:05:39.050> being<00:05:39.260> attacked<00:05:39.800> by

bit further south of being attacked by

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:41.379 
bit further south of being attacked by
bombers<00:05:40.520> here<00:05:40.669> so<00:05:40.760> going<00:05:40.880> to<00:05:40.910> be<00:05:41.000> taken<00:05:41.300> out

00:05:41.379 --> 00:05:41.389

bolo nothing but bolo on and he does

00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:58.370 
have a massive blob of them now if it

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:00.250 
have a massive blob of them now if it
had<00:05:58.669> to<00:05:58.820> had<00:05:58.940> engagement<00:05:59.479> occurs<00:05:59.720> like<00:05:59.990> this

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:00.260 
had to had engagement occurs like this

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.200 
had to had engagement occurs like this
but<00:06:00.770> he's<00:06:00.950> very<00:06:01.220> likely<00:06:01.550> to<00:06:01.669> win<00:06:01.849> because<00:06:02.000> he

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:02.210 
but he's very likely to win because he

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:04.770 
but he's very likely to win because he
is<00:06:02.300> going<00:06:02.479> to<00:06:02.599> start<00:06:02.780> cutting<00:06:02.960> away<00:06:03.169> the<00:06:03.229> ants

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:04.780 
is going to start cutting away the ants

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:08.409 
is going to start cutting away the ants
and<00:06:06.400> so<00:06:07.400> interesting<00:06:07.789> seal<00:06:08.030> that<00:06:08.150> production

00:06:08.409 --> 00:06:08.419 
and so interesting seal that production

00:06:08.419 --> 00:06:11.469 
and so interesting seal that production
going<00:06:08.780> up<00:06:08.900> from<00:06:09.200> cannock<00:06:10.130> and<00:06:10.370> now<00:06:11.090> matey's

00:06:11.469 --> 00:06:11.479 
going up from cannock and now matey's

00:06:11.479 --> 00:06:13.060 
going up from cannock and now matey's
beginning<00:06:11.900> to<00:06:12.020> catch<00:06:12.229> up<00:06:12.530> also<00:06:12.830> got<00:06:12.950> his

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:13.070 
beginning to catch up also got his

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:14.800 
beginning to catch up also got his
combat<00:06:13.430> fibers<00:06:13.729> patrolling<00:06:14.360> as<00:06:14.479> we've<00:06:14.630> seen

00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:14.810 
combat fibers patrolling as we've seen

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:16.570 
combat fibers patrolling as we've seen
before<00:06:14.990> initially<00:06:15.620> with<00:06:15.740> burn<00:06:15.919> custard<00:06:16.430> and

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:16.580 
before initially with burn custard and

00:06:16.580 --> 00:06:18.250 
before initially with burn custard and
they're<00:06:17.060> going<00:06:17.180> to<00:06:17.270> be<00:06:17.360> able<00:06:17.450> to<00:06:17.630> assist<00:06:17.870> those

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:18.260 
they're going to be able to assist those

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:19.510 
they're going to be able to assist those
factories<00:06:18.680> and<00:06:18.800> get<00:06:18.889> a<00:06:18.919> hold<00:06:19.130> of<00:06:19.220> more

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:19.520 
factories and get a hold of more

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:21.870 
factories and get a hold of more
production<00:06:19.970> out<00:06:20.060> quite<00:06:20.389> efficiently<00:06:20.870> and

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:21.880 
production out quite efficiently and

00:06:21.880 --> 00:06:23.980 
production out quite efficiently and
looking<00:06:22.880> like<00:06:23.000> a<00:06:23.060> lot<00:06:23.330> of<00:06:23.450> units<00:06:23.720> if<00:06:23.810> we<00:06:23.870> look

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:23.990 
looking like a lot of units if we look

00:06:23.990 --> 00:06:26.529 
looking like a lot of units if we look
over<00:06:24.110> to<00:06:24.200> the<00:06:24.229> army<00:06:24.650> tab<00:06:24.860> sitting<00:06:25.610> at<00:06:25.700> 61

00:06:26.529 --> 00:06:26.539 
over to the army tab sitting at 61

00:06:26.539 --> 00:06:29.020 
over to the army tab sitting at 61
former<00:06:27.110> tees<00:06:27.410> and<00:06:27.680> just<00:06:27.800> 24<00:06:28.310> mechanic<00:06:28.820> so<00:06:28.910> he's

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:29.030 
former tees and just 24 mechanic so he's

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:30.310 
former tees and just 24 mechanic so he's
really<00:06:29.389> far<00:06:29.539> ahead<00:06:29.690> and<00:06:29.840> if<00:06:29.930> he<00:06:29.990> just<00:06:30.110> keeps

00:06:30.310 --> 00:06:30.320 
really far ahead and if he just keeps

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:31.659 
really far ahead and if he just keeps
putting<00:06:30.560> the<00:06:30.620> pressure<00:06:30.770> on<00:06:30.979> now<00:06:31.130> mechanic<00:06:31.580> is

00:06:31.659 --> 00:06:31.669 
putting the pressure on now mechanic is

00:06:31.669 --> 00:06:33.460 
putting the pressure on now mechanic is
going<00:06:31.820> to<00:06:31.880> lose<00:06:32.120> ground<00:06:32.360> very<00:06:32.750> quickly<00:06:32.930> I'm

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:33.470 
going to lose ground very quickly I'm

00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:35.320 
going to lose ground very quickly I'm
already<00:06:34.070> such<00:06:34.460> a<00:06:34.490> big<00:06:34.760> early<00:06:35.090> advantage

00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:35.330 
already such a big early advantage

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:37.600 
already such a big early advantage
coming<00:06:35.720> in<00:06:35.870> from<00:06:36.139> matey's

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:37.610 
coming in from matey's

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:38.830 
coming in from matey's
going<00:06:37.819> to<00:06:37.879> put<00:06:38.030> a<00:06:38.060> lot<00:06:38.270> of<00:06:38.330> pressure<00:06:38.659> of

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:38.840 
going to put a lot of pressure of

00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:42.610 
going to put a lot of pressure of
mechanic<00:06:40.629> yeah<00:06:41.629> so<00:06:41.870> this<00:06:41.990> massive<00:06:42.379> law<00:06:42.500> of

00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:42.620 
mechanic yeah so this massive law of

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:43.540 
mechanic yeah so this massive law of
Tanks<00:06:42.889> is<00:06:42.979> going<00:06:43.159> to<00:06:43.219> starting<00:06:43.520> the

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:43.550 
Tanks is going to starting the

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:45.399 
Tanks is going to starting the
production<00:06:43.939> very<00:06:44.240> soon<00:06:44.539> there's<00:06:44.990> an<00:06:45.080> inferno

00:06:45.399 --> 00:06:45.409 
production very soon there's an inferno

00:06:45.409 --> 00:06:46.959 
production very soon there's an inferno
coming<00:06:45.680> out<00:06:45.770> for<00:06:46.219> mechanically<00:06:46.699> this<00:06:46.879> is

00:06:46.959 --> 00:06:46.969 
coming out for mechanically this is

00:06:46.969 --> 00:06:48.640 
coming out for mechanically this is
going<00:06:47.180> to<00:06:47.270> be<00:06:47.389> long<00:06:47.629> for<00:06:47.810> this<00:06:47.930> world<00:06:47.990> the

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:48.650 
going to be long for this world the

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:50.050 
going to be long for this world the
production<00:06:49.099> now<00:06:49.219> starting<00:06:49.580> to<00:06:49.639> take<00:06:49.759> damage

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:50.060 
production now starting to take damage

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:52.869 
production now starting to take damage
on<00:06:50.389> the<00:06:51.050> tanks<00:06:51.409> are<00:06:51.560> slowly<00:06:52.189> making<00:06:52.460> more<00:06:52.849> and

00:06:52.869 --> 00:06:52.879 
on the tanks are slowly making more and

00:06:52.879 --> 00:06:55.300 
on the tanks are slowly making more and
more<00:06:53.000> progress<00:06:53.539> and<00:06:53.810> as<00:06:54.770> this<00:06:55.009> progress

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:55.310 
more progress and as this progress

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:57.580 
more progress and as this progress
continues<00:06:55.819> I<00:06:56.270> don't<00:06:57.020> I<00:06:57.139> don't<00:06:57.199> really<00:06:57.469> see
