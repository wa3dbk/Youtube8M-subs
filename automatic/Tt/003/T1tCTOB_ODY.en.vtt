00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:22.250
 how could we tell you your network 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:32.750
 the others must join to put a network 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:32.750
 of network that would be roster 

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:41.520
 and the password and it was hello like it would not be 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:41.520
 everything then come together 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.470
 they close whatever is 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:55.090

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:25.110
 updated 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:37.709

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:39.980
 arrive 

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:48.269
 and well the one who created the network should go to 

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:52.489
 be and serve and wait and the others 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:52.489
 they must get into the client and 

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:58.140
 annotate 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:03:01.100
