there<00:02:00.060> are<00:02:00.240> four<00:02:00.600> things<00:02:00.869> I<00:02:01.079> asked<00:02:01.259> myself

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
there are four things I asked myself

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.319 
there are four things I asked myself
when<00:02:01.890> scoping<00:02:02.340> out<00:02:02.430> a<00:02:02.490> location<00:02:02.850> for<00:02:03.210> an

indoor garden number one where am I

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:07.670 
indoor garden number one where am I
going<00:02:06.149> to<00:02:06.299> ventilate<00:02:06.659> the<00:02:06.750> hot<00:02:06.899> air<00:02:07.049> 2<00:02:07.259> now

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
going to ventilate the hot air 2 now

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.219 
going to ventilate the hot air 2 now
fortunately<00:02:08.280> for<00:02:08.610> me<00:02:08.729> there's<00:02:09.300> this<00:02:09.539> disused

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
fortunately for me there's this disused

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.200 
old staircase at one end of the cellar
there<00:02:13.290> could<00:02:13.470> be<00:02:13.500> some<00:02:13.770> serious<00:02:14.340> extraction

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:15.210 
there could be some serious extraction

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:17.030 
there could be some serious extraction
possibilities<00:02:15.810> up<00:02:15.930> here<00:02:16.140> so<00:02:16.380> let's<00:02:16.800> take<00:02:16.890> a

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
possibilities up here so let's take a

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:21.890 
possibilities up here so let's take a
look<00:02:17.540> up<00:02:18.540> we<00:02:18.900> go<00:02:19.110> and<00:02:19.850> look<00:02:20.850> at<00:02:21.000> that<00:02:21.150> there's<00:02:21.870> a

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:21.900 
look up we go and look at that there's a

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.870 
look up we go and look at that there's a
window<00:02:22.320> out<00:02:22.350> into<00:02:22.890> the<00:02:23.010> courtyard<00:02:23.310> at<00:02:23.730> the

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
I can vent directly to my private little

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.340 
I can vent directly to my private little
space<00:02:28.560> of<00:02:28.740> the<00:02:28.830> outside<00:02:29.130> world<00:02:29.430> or<00:02:30.240> I<00:02:30.450> could

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
space of the outside world or I could

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.290 
space of the outside world or I could
knock<00:02:31.650> a<00:02:31.680> hole<00:02:31.950> into<00:02:32.190> my<00:02:32.310> kitchen<00:02:32.550> above<00:02:32.970> and

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 
knock a hole into my kitchen above and

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.180 
knock a hole into my kitchen above and
you<00:02:33.690> know<00:02:33.780> use<00:02:34.020> the<00:02:34.050> hot<00:02:34.320> expelled<00:02:34.710> air<00:02:34.950> to

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:35.190 
you know use the hot expelled air to

00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:37.070 
you know use the hot expelled air to
heat<00:02:35.370> my<00:02:35.520> house<00:02:35.640> during<00:02:35.880> the<00:02:36.000> wintertime<00:02:36.240> now

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
heat my house during the wintertime now

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.280 
heat my house during the wintertime now
number<00:02:37.680> two<00:02:37.860> what<00:02:38.460> about<00:02:38.670> incoming<00:02:39.420> air<00:02:39.690> well

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
number two what about incoming air well

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.010 
number two what about incoming air well
the<00:02:41.070> walls<00:02:41.310> here<00:02:41.610> are<00:02:41.820> a<00:02:41.850> few<00:02:42.000> feet<00:02:42.510> thick<00:02:42.780> and

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:43.020 
the walls here are a few feet thick and

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:46.610 
the walls here are a few feet thick and
they<00:02:43.260> are<00:02:43.500> solid<00:02:44.130> as<00:02:44.430> a<00:02:45.080> rock

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:46.620 
they are solid as a rock

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.070 
they are solid as a rock
so<00:02:46.920> making<00:02:47.400> holes<00:02:47.790> is<00:02:48.090> not<00:02:48.510> going<00:02:48.720> to<00:02:48.780> be<00:02:48.870> easy

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
so making holes is not going to be easy

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.260 
so making holes is not going to be easy
and<00:02:49.410> I<00:02:49.980> kind<00:02:50.490> of<00:02:50.550> want<00:02:50.730> to<00:02:50.790> leave<00:02:50.940> the<00:02:51.090> doors

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:51.270 
and I kind of want to leave the doors

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:53.840 
and I kind of want to leave the doors
intact<00:02:51.720> and<00:02:51.900> operational<00:02:52.220> but<00:02:53.220> what<00:02:53.670> about

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:53.850 
intact and operational but what about

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:55.520 
intact and operational but what about
this<00:02:54.000> little<00:02:54.270> storage<00:02:54.600> area<00:02:54.810> just<00:02:55.200> off<00:02:55.350> the

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
this little storage area just off the

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:58.850 
this little storage area just off the
cellar<00:02:55.770> let's<00:02:56.430> take<00:02:56.610> a<00:02:56.640> look<00:02:56.820> inside<00:02:57.680> see<00:02:58.680> it

00:02:58.850 --> 00:02:58.860 
cellar let's take a look inside see it

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.650 
cellar let's take a look inside see it
looks<00:02:59.190> like<00:02:59.370> this<00:02:59.550> partition<00:03:00.090> wall<00:03:00.240> has<00:03:00.450> been

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
looks like this partition wall has been

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:04.490 
looks like this partition wall has been
you<00:03:01.440> know<00:03:01.560> added<00:03:01.980> more<00:03:02.160> recently<00:03:03.440> listen<00:03:04.440> to

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:04.500 
you know added more recently listen to

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.910 
you know added more recently listen to
that<00:03:04.790> sounds<00:03:05.790> pretty<00:03:06.000> Hollow<00:03:06.600> I<00:03:06.930> could<00:03:07.590> bust

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:07.920 
that sounds pretty Hollow I could bust

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.470 
that sounds pretty Hollow I could bust
through<00:03:08.250> and<00:03:08.460> create<00:03:08.730> an<00:03:08.850> intake<00:03:09.150> from<00:03:09.330> the

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480 
through and create an intake from the

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:12.530 
through and create an intake from the
adjacent<00:03:09.780> room<00:03:10.200> here<00:03:10.680> no<00:03:11.310> problem<00:03:11.820> and<00:03:12.000> it

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:12.540 
adjacent room here no problem and it

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:13.850 
adjacent room here no problem and it
could<00:03:12.750> be<00:03:12.870> good<00:03:12.900> for<00:03:13.050> storing<00:03:13.440> nutrient

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 
could be good for storing nutrient

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.010 
could be good for storing nutrient
solution<00:03:14.220> too<00:03:14.480> let's<00:03:15.480> check<00:03:15.690> the<00:03:15.810> other<00:03:15.960> side

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:16.020 
solution too let's check the other side

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:19.520 
solution too let's check the other side
of<00:03:16.290> this<00:03:16.380> wall<00:03:17.120> yeah<00:03:18.120> we<00:03:18.720> can<00:03:18.900> make<00:03:19.020> a<00:03:19.080> hole<00:03:19.320> in

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:19.530 
of this wall yeah we can make a hole in

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:22.910 
of this wall yeah we can make a hole in
here<00:03:19.770> easily<00:03:20.270> now<00:03:21.270> number<00:03:21.810> three<00:03:22.080> where's<00:03:22.710> my
