00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:15.230 
think when they go out into the world to

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:16.930 
think when they go out into the world to
pursue<00:02:15.800> other<00:02:16.040> things<00:02:16.129> they're<00:02:16.580> going<00:02:16.730> to<00:02:16.790> be

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:16.940 
pursue other things they're going to be

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:18.400 
pursue other things they're going to be
much<00:02:17.270> better<00:02:17.480> equipped<00:02:17.930> from<00:02:18.260> this

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
much better equipped from this

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:24.370 

these<00:03:21.740> original<00:03:22.370> conceptual<00:03:23.090> ideas<00:03:23.600> which

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
their combined efforts they've not only

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.550 
their combined efforts they've not only
learned<00:03:34.580> to<00:03:34.760> be<00:03:34.850> better<00:03:35.030> designers<00:03:35.690> but<00:03:36.350> have

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:36.560 
learned to be better designers but have

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.470 
learned to be better designers but have
also<00:03:36.710> contributed<00:03:37.160> to<00:03:37.550> the<00:03:37.670> people<00:03:38.000> of<00:03:38.090> Norris

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:38.480 
also contributed to the people of Norris

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:41.680 
also contributed to the people of Norris
and<00:03:38.690> it's<00:03:39.320> legacy
