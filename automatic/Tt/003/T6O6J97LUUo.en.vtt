these are going to go on your arms we're
going<00:02:15.560> to<00:02:15.620> find<00:02:15.830> the<00:02:16.010> center<00:02:16.430> between<00:02:17.330> needs

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:17.750 
going to find the center between needs

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.440 
going to find the center between needs
to<00:02:18.080> then<00:02:18.860> see<00:02:19.070> where<00:02:19.220> they<00:02:19.310> slightly<00:02:19.730> bend<00:02:20.270> it

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
to then see where they slightly bend it

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.460 
to then see where they slightly bend it
doesn't<00:02:21.440> have<00:02:21.530> to<00:02:21.650> be<00:02:21.800> much

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:29.690 
then we'll have to bend these this way a

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:33.010 
then we'll have to bend these this way a
little<00:02:29.870> here<00:02:30.670> the<00:02:31.670> bin<00:02:31.910> started<00:02:32.390> up<00:02:32.510> at<00:02:32.630> about

little here the bin started up at about
two<00:02:33.320> inches<00:02:33.590> so<00:02:33.650> I<00:02:33.860> put<00:02:34.220> this<00:02:34.610> point<00:02:35.030> in<00:02:35.750> the

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:36.350 
two inches so I put this point in the

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:38.890 
two inches so I put this point in the
vise<00:02:36.820> so<00:02:37.820> I<00:02:37.880> need<00:02:38.060> to<00:02:38.150> put<00:02:38.330> it<00:02:38.420> back<00:02:38.450> in<00:02:38.810> the

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:38.900 
vise so I need to put it back in the

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.370 
vise so I need to put it back in the
vise<00:02:39.140> that's<00:02:40.010> about<00:02:40.280> two<00:02:40.519> inches<00:02:41.080> and<00:02:42.080> then

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:42.380 
vise that's about two inches and then

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:46.150 
vise that's about two inches and then
the<00:02:42.590> center<00:02:42.980> Bend<00:02:43.660> ended<00:02:44.660> up<00:02:44.810> being<00:02:45.200> 14<00:02:46.130> and

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:46.160 
the center Bend ended up being 14 and

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.979 
the center Bend ended up being 14 and
3/8<00:02:47.019> just<00:02:48.019> like<00:02:48.489> 28<00:02:49.489> and<00:02:49.640> 3/4<00:02:50.390> inches<00:02:50.420> so<00:02:50.930> I

00:02:50.979 --> 00:02:50.989 
3/8 just like 28 and 3/4 inches so I

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:53.080 
3/8 just like 28 and 3/4 inches so I
just<00:02:51.200> found<00:02:51.350> the<00:02:51.560> center<00:02:51.920> started<00:02:52.700> my<00:02:52.850> bin

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 
just found the center started my bin

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:56.160 
just found the center started my bin
there<00:02:53.420> kind<00:02:53.900> of<00:02:53.989> rounded<00:02:54.440> it<00:02:54.590> as<00:02:54.800> you<00:02:55.040> can<00:02:55.220> see

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.170 
there kind of rounded it as you can see

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:58.900 
there kind of rounded it as you can see
then<00:02:57.170> I<00:02:57.260> came<00:02:57.320> in<00:02:57.860> that's<00:02:58.250> where<00:02:58.459> the<00:02:58.550> elbows

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 
then I came in that's where the elbows

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:00.820 
then I came in that's where the elbows
going<00:02:59.209> I'm<00:02:59.690> going<00:02:59.870> to<00:02:59.930> make<00:03:00.050> more<00:03:00.290> of<00:03:00.350> a<00:03:00.530> bend

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:00.830 
going I'm going to make more of a bend

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:04.449 
going I'm going to make more of a bend
here<00:03:01.400> and<00:03:02.269> more<00:03:02.540> of<00:03:02.630> a<00:03:02.720> bend<00:03:03.019> here<00:03:03.410> just<00:03:04.310> kind

00:03:04.449 --> 00:03:04.459 
here and more of a bend here just kind

00:03:04.459 --> 00:03:06.190 
here and more of a bend here just kind
of<00:03:04.519> work<00:03:04.700> with<00:03:04.940> it<00:03:04.970> it<00:03:05.480> actually<00:03:05.780> been<00:03:05.959> pretty

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:06.200 
of work with it it actually been pretty

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.620 
of work with it it actually been pretty
easily<00:03:06.470> because<00:03:06.850> the<00:03:07.850> width<00:03:08.060> isn't<00:03:08.360> that<00:03:08.480> much

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:08.630 
easily because the width isn't that much

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:10.780 
easily because the width isn't that much
it's<00:03:08.870> only<00:03:09.019> four<00:03:09.320> inches<00:03:09.590> so<00:03:10.549> I'm<00:03:10.610> going<00:03:10.730> to

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790 
it's only four inches so I'm going to

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:12.460 
it's only four inches so I'm going to
get<00:03:10.880> some<00:03:11.030> more<00:03:11.090> bins<00:03:11.360> on<00:03:11.600> this<00:03:11.780> thing<00:03:12.019> then

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
get some more bins on this thing then

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:22.610 
get some more bins on this thing then
we're<00:03:12.650> going<00:03:12.769> to<00:03:12.830> see<00:03:12.980> what<00:03:13.130> we<00:03:13.250> come<00:03:13.400> up<00:03:13.459> with

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:25.020 

then<00:03:23.620> you<00:03:23.920> know<00:03:24.040> the<00:03:24.189> basic<00:03:24.519> thing<00:03:24.670> is<00:03:24.790> to<00:03:24.909> get

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
then you know the basic thing is to get

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:28.080 
then you know the basic thing is to get
that<00:03:25.799> that<00:03:26.799> point<00:03:27.159> they<00:03:27.310> were<00:03:27.489> you're<00:03:28.030> not

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:28.090 
that that point they were you're not

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:30.390 
that that point they were you're not
going<00:03:28.329> to<00:03:28.390> be<00:03:28.480> cheating<00:03:28.930> the<00:03:28.959> bar<00:03:29.260> up<00:03:29.469> and

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:30.400 
going to be cheating the bar up and

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.170 
going to be cheating the bar up and
you're<00:03:30.579> just<00:03:30.730> going<00:03:30.909> to<00:03:31.170> keep<00:03:32.170> that<00:03:32.319> isolation

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 
you're just going to keep that isolation

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.509 
you're just going to keep that isolation
stop<00:03:34.180> those<00:03:34.389> elbows<00:03:34.659> moving<00:03:35.280> and<00:03:36.280> get<00:03:36.400> that

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:36.519 
stop those elbows moving and get that

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:37.830 
stop those elbows moving and get that
bicep<00:03:37.030> going<00:03:37.359> good

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:37.840 
bicep going good

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.119 
bicep going good
you<00:03:38.290> know<00:03:38.379> I'm<00:03:38.469> thinking<00:03:38.500> if<00:03:38.829> you're<00:03:38.920> going<00:03:39.040> to

00:03:39.119 --> 00:03:39.129 
you know I'm thinking if you're going to

00:03:39.129 --> 00:03:41.160 
you know I'm thinking if you're going to
make<00:03:39.340> one<00:03:39.549> just<00:03:40.090> make<00:03:40.299> it<00:03:40.389> a<00:03:40.480> little<00:03:40.659> shorter

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:41.170 
make one just make it a little shorter

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:44.129 
make one just make it a little shorter
to<00:03:41.950> the<00:03:42.069> buff<00:03:42.310> dudes<00:03:42.810> obviously<00:03:43.810> it's<00:03:44.019> going

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:44.139 
to the buff dudes obviously it's going

00:03:44.139 --> 00:03:47.789 
to the buff dudes obviously it's going
to<00:03:44.230> be<00:03:44.319> just<00:03:44.500> right<00:03:45.060> but<00:03:46.439> maybe<00:03:47.439> you<00:03:47.560> want<00:03:47.680> to

00:03:47.789 --> 00:03:47.799 
to be just right but maybe you want to

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:49.800 
to be just right but maybe you want to
cut<00:03:47.980> it<00:03:48.069> this<00:03:48.189> was<00:03:48.400> 28<00:03:48.819> and<00:03:48.939> 3/4<00:03:49.359> you<00:03:49.480> may<00:03:49.599> want

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:49.810 
cut it this was 28 and 3/4 you may want

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:51.119 
cut it this was 28 and 3/4 you may want
to<00:03:49.870> cut<00:03:50.049> it<00:03:50.169> down<00:03:50.290> a<00:03:50.349> couple<00:03:50.439> of<00:03:50.769> inches

00:03:51.119 --> 00:03:51.129 
to cut it down a couple of inches

00:03:51.129 --> 00:03:54.479 
to cut it down a couple of inches
I<00:03:51.280> think<00:03:51.909> 22<00:03:52.329> inches<00:03:52.629> is<00:03:52.840> too<00:03:53.079> short<00:03:53.349> but<00:03:53.859> if

00:03:54.479 --> 00:03:54.489 
I think 22 inches is too short but if

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:56.129 
I think 22 inches is too short but if
you<00:03:54.760> got<00:03:54.939> one<00:03:55.180> and<00:03:55.329> that's<00:03:55.480> what<00:03:55.599> it<00:03:55.780> is<00:03:55.930> it

00:03:56.129 --> 00:03:56.139 
you got one and that's what it is it

00:03:56.139 --> 00:04:01.110 
you got one and that's what it is it
