00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:39.920 
quick easy if they change the system now

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.160 
quick easy if they change the system now
um<00:00:40.920> it's<00:00:41.370> a<00:00:41.399> lot<00:00:41.579> sleeker<00:00:42.210> that<00:00:42.780> they<00:00:42.870> did<00:00:43.050> they

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:43.170 
um it's a lot sleeker that they did they

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.170 
um it's a lot sleeker that they did they
worked<00:00:43.350> out<00:00:43.469> some<00:00:43.680> kinks<00:00:43.890> especially<00:00:44.550> the

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
worked out some kinks especially the

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.630 
worked out some kinks especially the
primary<00:00:45.750> pump<00:00:45.930> it's<00:00:46.559> designed<00:00:47.280> a<00:00:47.370> little<00:00:47.550> bit

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:47.640 
primary pump it's designed a little bit

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.580 
primary pump it's designed a little bit
way<00:00:47.730> better<00:00:47.940> than<00:00:48.059> the<00:00:48.239> other<00:00:48.420> ones<00:00:48.660> if<00:00:49.320> anyone

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
way better than the other ones if anyone

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.130 
way better than the other ones if anyone
had<00:00:49.739> to<00:00:49.829> flooville<00:00:50.039> the<00:00:50.340> old<00:00:50.489> fools<00:00:51.140> they'd

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
had to flooville the old fools they'd

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.720 
had to flooville the old fools they'd
probably<00:00:52.350> found<00:00:52.739> out<00:00:52.920> like<00:00:53.070> mines

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
probably found out like mines

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.729 
probably found out like mines
it<00:00:54.239> was<00:00:54.390> the<00:00:54.480> priming<00:00:54.870> it<00:00:54.960> you<00:00:55.289> know<00:00:55.379> became<00:00:55.710> a

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
it was the priming it you know became a

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.560 
it was the priming it you know became a
kind<00:00:56.160> of<00:00:56.219> like<00:00:56.370> a<00:00:56.399> little<00:00:56.760> pay<00:00:56.969> a<00:00:57.000> little<00:00:57.270> pest
