00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 hi we are if you want shaun with this is 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:06.509
 a flash drive to the cast of 516 one of the 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.069
 models to be connected behind the TV behind 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.200
 a monitor not to make it compatible 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:13.650
 with smartphone and tablet you can 

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.389
 buy on v2 comp w2 comp puntocom 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:17.039
 it costs around 35 dollars I am 

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:18.960
 trying for a few days too 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:21.570
 a very nice outdoor antenna 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.949
 now i'm ready static but ok vi 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.510
 arrives in this framework is 

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:26.880
 very pretty it is completely plastic 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:29.550
 looks like one of those keys 3g 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:34.250
 with our key inside 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.250
 now the o out 

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:40.559
 here it is the hdmi extension cable 

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.910
 micro usb for power supply is not there 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.149
 the power supply because clearly yes 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.640
 feeds with TV the Tina key is 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.969
 classic academy male type to the 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.469
 pulsantino fiction here in relief a 

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:54.239
 led that will signal the ignition the micro 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.980
 usb as mentioned 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.379
 feeding a grid of 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:00.989
 fairly obvious ventilation e 

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.760
 this one that has an external curtain one way 

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.110
 to extend to carry out 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.670
 lanternine then improve the 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.010
 wireless reception we know this thing 

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:12.090
 it is very important that this is twenty 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:14.520
 based on the roxy rk 29 28 chipset to the single 

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.600
 core with 256 mega ram memory and that 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.369
 the sector certainly follows 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.140
 will remember why one was presented 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.460
 of the last fairs but they are given 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.380
 which are of little interest in this genre 

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.150
 of products rather than maybe 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.790
 you might be comfortable to know are the 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.020
 dimensions are equal to 11 for two 

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.909
 about an inch and a half 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.189
 one centimeter thick is very much 

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.290
 compact and now I close all the 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.549
 connect the TV and see how it goes to do 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:37.619
 operate a tina mirra cast key 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.150
 like this just connect it to the door 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.650
 television usb does not need a 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:42.810
 external power supply because consumption is 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:44.820
 really low then once on the first 

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.460
 start you will be asked for some of them 

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.020
 things to connect it or not to the wifi network of 

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.909
 home and then you can set the mode 

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.369
 target cast that is good for android or 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.380
 windows 8 or the cast mode 

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:56.880
 that a bit of a clone of air play no e 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.200
 works for apple devices 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.880
 this is an android tablet to be 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.670
 set in aim box mode of 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.920
 behind the 

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.420
 the graphics of the wifi display I'm going into 

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.159
 wireless display 

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:07.540
 I see my carrettin called the olive tree 

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:09.550
 but I can call it a name change 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:11.200
 markedly superior and I click and see that the 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:13.690
 shoulders will now start connecting 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.670
 a matter of a few seconds and 

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:18.280
 I'll have my screen mirroring of 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:20.350
 all the android display here is that 

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:23.050
 there we can also clearly rotate 

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:24.430
 if I want to keep the screen in size 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.720
 in full size, in short, to exploit 

00:02:24.430 --> 00:02:27.370
 better tv but for now for me 

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.380
 comfort I go on like this experience 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:31.420
 with android it's not really exciting 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:33.730
 I must also say that I had to exploit 

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:35.380
 the hdmi extension to carry a little more 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:37.630
 near the key closer to me 

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:38.650
 which are three meters from the television 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:40.690
 at this moment the signal 

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:42.670
 then began to be a little low 

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:45.130
 the low performance I show 

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:47.140
 also that playmovies if I do now 

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:49.810
 leave a movie maybe quest american 

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.069
 Pie knows the Tina key in the sense 

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:54.420
 which gives me the possibility of reproduction 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:57.069
 on external screen as you see 

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:58.660
 loading on lollipop is in 

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:00.519
 reproduction on lollipop but in reality 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:02.920
 as you can see the reproduction does not take place 

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:04.450
 without only claudio while we know 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.329
 that this thing I had tried also on 

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.709
 others on other devices listen to it 

00:03:07.329 --> 00:03:11.829
 week especially with the kitten between 

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:13.540
 smart was sent video and audio to 

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:15.370
 TV and only the controls remain 

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:17.799
 and give something very comfortable for the 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:20.650
 rest though if padus on youtube I don't have 

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:22.780
 problems starting a common movie 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.370
 like this and see it on television with 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.799
 so much of the car clearly the sound of the 

00:03:24.370 --> 00:03:28.540
 tablet is put on 

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:30.640
 it is muted while there is 

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:32.680
 almost external screen revolution 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.510
 and even put full screen maybe it 

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:36.160
 around so I see the natural size 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:37.930
 you will see that the film is behind me 

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.780
 that is not going ahead either 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:43.299
 so much delay compared to the display and 

00:03:40.780 --> 00:03:46.120
 it is a modality that can be 

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:47.829
 here is what we may be visiting 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.920
 maybe it's a modality that can be 

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:52.329
 useful so if you need to look 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:54.310
 a movie to share movies on 

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:57.010
 youtube and anything else is the same type 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:59.560
 of experience both with web browsing 

00:03:57.010 --> 00:04:00.760
 your browser or clear evolution 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.650
 here we see maybe maybe a little 

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:06.340
 better late but as you see it is 

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:08.560
 quite low and this is one way 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:09.700
 very very nice to browse in 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.459
 family in company if you have to 

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.130
 share something maybe in one 

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:15.350
 room with 

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:16.850
 in the union, something like that is fine 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:18.380
 now I close because that's all 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:20.630
 what we can see on android 

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:22.160
 pass windows 8 and as we will see which one 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:23.240
 things are definitely better I have the 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:25.850
 my cables na set to mode 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:28.280
 target cast I go to windows 8 this is a 

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:30.260
 asus vivo tap note in devices 

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:31.280
 project I have my key here 

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:32.840
 ready but added it 

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:34.650
 simply by clicking on add one 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:37.410
 wireless screen 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:39.810
 and see that now there will be the 

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:43.050
 connection now we are in standy 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:45.620
 or what desktops can I manage in a 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:48.180
 second screen as if it were just a 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:51.000
 traditional screen you see it behind 

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:53.310
 I'm moving my window fair I can 

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.259
 continue to keep my environment of 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:57.780
 windows thing very very useful 

00:04:55.259 --> 00:04:59.669
 practically a real touch or desktop but 

00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:01.710
 that while it turns out to me particularly 

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:02.520
 useful in this tablet because not all 

00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:04.410
 hdmi output 

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:06.660
 in this way I can do it I assure you 

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:09.240
 that you can use if you have to 

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:10.919
 write if you need to watch a movie 

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.449
 also something you really succeed at 

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:14.789
 do there is a moment of latency but 

00:05:12.449 --> 00:05:17.490
 absolutely usable for this 

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:20.840
 kind of things can clearly 

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:25.050
 also set the mirroring mode 

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:27.860
 duplicate and at this point I have practically 

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:29.070
 a real a true clone no 

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:34.680
 interface 

00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:36.300
 look at the good reactivity no and I have to 

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:37.919
 say that this windows mode are 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:41.340
 one had particular problems of 

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:43.260
 reception in the fall problems of 

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:45.389
 draw or in any case artificial on 

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:47.849
 screen yes there is something light but 

00:05:45.389 --> 00:05:49.590
 in short, nothing to worry about 

00:05:47.849 --> 00:05:51.180
 internet explodes because I want to leave 

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:55.349
 a video this is a youtube climate and 

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:57.180
 we are on evolution you see good 

00:05:55.349 --> 00:05:59.430
 definitely much much better than that 

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:00.810
 that we've seen with android is a bit 

00:05:59.430 --> 00:06:02.520
 a surprise because usually these 

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:05.669
 dialects did very well with 

00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:07.740
 android display wireless mode is 

00:06:05.669 --> 00:06:09.870
 a little less well with the milan cast 

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:12.120
 katie shore from him of ok what else to say 

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:13.590
 of this between 516 smart was not 

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:15.030
 a good review with android was 

00:06:13.590 --> 00:06:16.740
 bad among other things did not like 

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:19.159
 not even that management interface 

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:21.870
 too too thin with an html page 

00:06:19.159 --> 00:06:22.770
 without really css almost and with the 

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:24.870
 ability to switch between modes 

00:06:22.770 --> 00:06:26.970
 to the other one and just while it was 

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:28.229
 surprising the test with windows 8.1 

00:06:26.970 --> 00:06:30.330
 because I really didn't expect it that way 

00:06:28.229 --> 00:06:32.669
 ready so reactive when liked 

00:06:30.330 --> 00:06:35.520
 also the build quality the paci 

00:06:32.669 --> 00:06:37.199
 less beautiful package with which it arrives 

00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:38.430
 the piece clearly low because 105 

00:06:37.199 --> 00:06:40.229
 dollars can be there 

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:41.680
 just recommend it if you have 

00:06:40.229 --> 00:06:43.720
 need a model 

00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:45.699
 for windows 8 if you are looking for something 

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:47.889
 more universal ie i find it smart than 

00:06:45.699 --> 00:06:50.380
 a thousand dear surveyed a few days ago that 

00:06:47.889 --> 00:06:51.820
 supports the suffered z cast which is a 

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:53.889
 suite of sharing programs 

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:55.780
 it works better it also costs a little less 

00:06:53.889 --> 00:06:58.090
 from that from what I remember that 

00:06:55.780 --> 00:07:00.430
 advice as a general purpose use for 

00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:02.139
 more information on this e ti 516 

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:04.300
 go look at the full review 

00:07:02.139 --> 00:07:05.860
 that online on evolution pointit written 

00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:07.150
 some things even more technical I have 

00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:08.800
 took some photos from components 

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:10.060
 inside and among others inside is 

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:11.220
 really made less in council 

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:12.970
 go and see why I am 

00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:16.020
 you can find interesting already 

00:07:12.970 --> 00:07:16.020
 online on evolution
