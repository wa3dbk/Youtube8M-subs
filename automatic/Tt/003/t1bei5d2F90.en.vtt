we take the note see

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.560 
we take the note see
how<00:00:12.660> many<00:00:12.900> seas<00:00:13.320> do<00:00:13.620> you<00:00:13.770> have<00:00:13.950> okay<00:00:14.550> and<00:00:14.850> a

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
how many seas do you have okay and a

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.600 
how many seas do you have okay and a
good<00:00:15.900> trick<00:00:16.139> is<00:00:16.320> always<00:00:16.500> because<00:00:17.040> we<00:00:17.070> all<00:00:17.340> have

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:17.610 
good trick is always because we all have

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:21.290 
good trick is always because we all have
the<00:00:17.790> octave<00:00:19.250> whoever<00:00:20.250> who<00:00:20.550> have<00:00:20.760> the<00:00:20.880> bottom

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
the octave whoever who have the bottom

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.570 
the octave whoever who have the bottom
we<00:00:21.510> always<00:00:21.990> know<00:00:22.230> where<00:00:22.590> to<00:00:22.710> find<00:00:22.860> it<00:00:23.010> is<00:00:23.189> true

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
we always know where to find it is true

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.820 
we always know where to find it is true
towards<00:00:24.540> the<00:00:24.660> same<00:00:24.840> node<00:00:25.050> so<00:00:25.290> we<00:00:25.320> have<00:00:25.529> a<00:00:25.560> see

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:25.830 
towards the same node so we have a see

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:29.090 
towards the same node so we have a see
here<00:00:26.130> and<00:00:26.849> a<00:00:26.910> see<00:00:27.180> here<00:00:27.890> okay

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:29.100 
here and a see here okay

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.990 
here and a see here okay
next<00:00:29.940> place<00:00:30.210> we<00:00:30.420> can<00:00:30.539> find<00:00:30.810> seas<00:00:31.440> of<00:00:31.710> course<00:00:32.000> on

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:33.000 
next place we can find seas of course on

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.810 
next place we can find seas of course on
the<00:00:33.239> same<00:00:33.559> on<00:00:34.559> the<00:00:34.680> same<00:00:34.860> pattern<00:00:35.340> on<00:00:35.460> the<00:00:35.610> same

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:35.820 
the same on the same pattern on the same

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.610 
the same on the same pattern on the same
string<00:00:36.150> sample<00:00:36.629> I'm<00:00:36.780> fretting<00:00:37.050> here<00:00:37.379> the

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:37.620 
string sample I'm fretting here the

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:41.540 
string sample I'm fretting here the
third<00:00:38.220> fret<00:00:38.430> of<00:00:38.489> the<00:00:38.610> a<00:00:38.730> string<00:00:40.010> fifth<00:00:41.010> fret<00:00:41.160> of

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:41.550 
third fret of the a string fifth fret of

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.310 
third fret of the a string fifth fret of
the<00:00:41.610> g<00:00:41.879> string<00:00:41.910> if<00:00:42.330> we<00:00:42.540> just<00:00:42.720> move<00:00:43.019> that

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
the g string if we just move that

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.389 
the g string if we just move that
pattern<00:00:43.769> up<00:00:43.890> to<00:00:43.920> the<00:00:44.190> next<00:00:44.399> octave<00:00:44.760> here<00:00:46.399> then

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
pattern up to the next octave here then

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.870 
pattern up to the next octave here then
we<00:00:47.550> can<00:00:47.730> at<00:00:47.880> least<00:00:47.910> fantasy<00:00:48.980> one<00:00:49.980> two<00:00:50.190> three

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:50.880 
we can at least fantasy one two three

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:54.200 
we can at least fantasy one two three
four<00:00:51.120> C's<00:00:51.480> then<00:00:52.440> of<00:00:52.559> course<00:00:52.829> this<00:00:53.489> C<00:00:53.820> we<00:00:54.059> can

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
four C's then of course this C we can

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:06.170 
four C's then of course this C we can
find<00:00:54.450> on<00:00:54.600> the<00:00:54.719> E<00:00:54.750> string<00:01:00.980> that's<00:01:04.940> not<00:01:05.940> that

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
find on the E string that's not that

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.880 
find on the E string that's not that
useful<00:01:07.399> what<00:01:08.399> is<00:01:08.520> there<00:01:09.110> so<00:01:10.110> actually<00:01:10.560> I<00:01:10.619> got

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:10.890 
useful what is there so actually I got

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.550 
useful what is there so actually I got
eight<00:01:11.130> C's<00:01:11.580> on<00:01:11.880> this<00:01:12.060> base<00:01:12.300> because<00:01:12.780> I<00:01:12.899> had<00:01:13.020> 22

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
eight C's on this base because I had 22

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.889 
eight C's on this base because I had 22
frets<00:01:13.860> but<00:01:14.670> a<00:01:14.700> novel<00:01:15.090> Fender<00:01:15.420> bass<00:01:15.570> you<00:01:15.750> only

00:01:15.889 --> 00:01:15.899 
frets but a novel Fender bass you only

00:01:15.899 --> 00:01:20.240 
frets but a novel Fender bass you only
have<00:01:16.140> these<00:01:18.020> 20<00:01:19.020> frets<00:01:19.259> or<00:01:19.619> something

so<00:01:20.459> see

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:26.060 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:31.149 

at<00:01:26.659> 6:00<00:01:27.049> at<00:01:27.200> least<00:01:27.440> okay<00:01:28.010> take<00:01:28.640> F<00:01:30.159> always

00:01:31.149 --> 00:01:31.159 
at 6:00 at least okay take F always

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:34.990 
at 6:00 at least okay take F always
remember<00:01:31.640> the<00:01:31.729> optimum<00:01:32.560> and<00:01:33.610> then<00:01:34.610> here<00:01:34.820> we

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.000 
remember the optimum and then here we

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.390 
remember the optimum and then here we
have<00:01:35.210> the<00:01:35.390> e<00:01:35.659> the<00:01:36.590> grip<00:01:36.860> here<00:01:37.100> with<00:01:37.280> the<00:01:37.369> E

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:37.400 
have the e the grip here with the E

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.310 
have the e the grip here with the E
string<00:01:37.790> and<00:01:38.000> the<00:01:38.150> D<00:01:38.180> you<00:01:38.690> can<00:01:38.810> always<00:01:39.020> find<00:01:39.170> it

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:39.320 
string and the D you can always find it

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:41.260 
string and the D you can always find it
up<00:01:39.440> here

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:41.270 
up here

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:46.179 
up here
and<00:01:41.780> then<00:01:42.350> on<00:01:42.470> a<00:01:42.650> string<00:01:43.270> we<00:01:44.270> have<00:01:44.500> one<00:01:45.500> two

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:46.189 
and then on a string we have one two

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:54.340 
and then on a string we have one two
three<00:01:47.090> four<00:01:47.950> five<00:01:49.060> six<00:01:52.330> we<00:01:53.330> cannot<00:01:53.659> find<00:01:54.140> out

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
three four five six we cannot find out

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.499 
three four five six we cannot find out
here<00:01:54.530> and<00:01:54.680> half<00:01:54.830> three<00:01:55.460> two<00:01:55.700> three

00:01:56.499 --> 00:01:56.509 
here and half three two three

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:04.359 
here and half three two three
so<00:01:57.320> actually<00:01:57.770> have<00:01:57.920> any<00:01:58.159> ifs<00:01:58.610> yeah<00:01:59.539> I<00:02:03.100> try<00:02:04.100> last

00:02:04.359 --> 00:02:04.369 
so actually have any ifs yeah I try last

00:02:04.369 --> 00:02:09.759 
so actually have any ifs yeah I try last
one<00:02:04.610> with<00:02:04.789> a<00:02:05.030> flap<00:02:07.959> anybody<00:02:08.959> anybody<00:02:09.349> in<00:02:09.709> a

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:09.769 
one with a flap anybody anybody in a

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:14.430 
one with a flap anybody anybody in a
dozen<00:02:10.009> effort<00:02:10.429> here<00:02:11.500> tells<00:02:12.500> me<00:02:12.590> one<00:02:13.099> two<00:02:13.430> three

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:14.440 
dozen effort here tells me one two three

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:19.300 
dozen effort here tells me one two three
four<00:02:15.440> five<00:02:16.430> six<00:02:17.360> seven<00:02:18.260> eight<00:02:18.709> nine

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310 
four five six seven eight nine

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.559 
four five six seven eight nine
and<00:02:19.610> so<00:02:20.180> forth<00:02:21.130> so<00:02:22.130> that's<00:02:22.880> a<00:02:23.000> good<00:02:23.150> thing<00:02:23.209> to

00:02:23.559 --> 00:02:23.569 
and so forth so that's a good thing to

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:26.740 
and so forth so that's a good thing to
practice<00:02:24.519> because<00:02:25.519> also<00:02:25.880> if<00:02:26.120> you<00:02:26.239> play<00:02:26.480> a<00:02:26.510> rock

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:26.750 
practice because also if you play a rock

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:43.850 
practice because also if you play a rock
song<00:02:27.019> you<00:02:27.260> want<00:02:27.470> to<00:02:27.530> be<00:02:27.650> into<00:02:28.010> this

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:43.860 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:57.350 

striding<00:02:44.860> up<00:02:44.950> the<00:02:45.130> odds

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.440 

if<00:02:58.360> you<00:02:58.480> want<00:02:58.689> to<00:02:58.780> do<00:02:58.870> it<00:02:59.019> list<00:02:59.799> down<00:03:00.040> to<00:03:00.670> start

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:01.450 
if you want to do it list down to start

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.509 
if you want to do it list down to start
at<00:03:01.569> you<00:03:01.689> so<00:03:02.230> it's<00:03:02.379> always<00:03:02.590> personal<00:03:03.010> whether

00:03:03.509 --> 00:03:03.519 
at you so it's always personal whether

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:06.240 
at you so it's always personal whether
the<00:03:04.000> different<00:03:04.420> notes<00:03:04.599> are<00:03:04.890> another<00:03:05.890> thing<00:03:06.099> to

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:06.250 
the different notes are another thing to

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.009 
the different notes are another thing to
get<00:03:06.370> to<00:03:06.519> know<00:03:06.640> that<00:03:06.849> your<00:03:07.000> fretboard<00:03:07.510> is<00:03:07.659> using

00:03:08.009 --> 00:03:08.019 
get to know that your fretboard is using

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:10.500 
get to know that your fretboard is using
arpeggios<00:03:08.549> arpeggios<00:03:09.549> is<00:03:09.730> actually<00:03:10.090> taking<00:03:10.450> a

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:10.510 
arpeggios arpeggios is actually taking a

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:13.319 
arpeggios arpeggios is actually taking a
chord<00:03:10.840> playing<00:03:11.530> one<00:03:11.739> note<00:03:11.890> at<00:03:12.069> a<00:03:12.099> time<00:03:12.329> like

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:13.329

00:03:57.190 --> 00:03:57.200 
tried a third fifth and then we have

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:59.350 
tried a third fifth and then we have
there's<00:03:57.830> only<00:03:57.950> three<00:03:58.250> notes<00:03:58.430> we<00:03:58.940> just<00:03:59.150> start

00:03:59.350 --> 00:03:59.360 
there's only three notes we just start

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:01.180 
there's only three notes we just start
with<00:03:59.540> the<00:03:59.630> fifth<00:03:59.840> because<00:04:00.260> the<00:04:00.470> fifth<00:04:00.739> roof

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:01.190 
with the fifth because the fifth roof

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:04.870 
with the fifth because the fifth roof
fifth<00:04:01.750> movement<00:04:02.750> is<00:04:03.320> very<00:04:03.590> common<00:04:04.070> in<00:04:04.250> playing

bass<00:04:05.630> lines<00:04:05.980> simple<00:04:06.980> bass<00:04:07.160> lines<00:04:07.400> and<00:04:07.640> that's

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:08.510 
bass lines simple bass lines and that's

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:10.900 
bass lines simple bass lines and that's
good<00:04:08.780> there's<00:04:09.230> a<00:04:09.440> good<00:04:09.650> thing<00:04:09.680> to<00:04:10.220> know<00:04:10.340> of<00:04:10.580> the

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:10.910 
good there's a good thing to know of the

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:12.910 
good there's a good thing to know of the
fretboard<00:04:11.150> because<00:04:11.630> you<00:04:11.870> can<00:04:12.050> move<00:04:12.200> positions

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:12.920 
fretboard because you can move positions

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.160 
fretboard because you can move positions
and<00:04:13.100> all<00:04:13.190> that<00:04:13.340> so<00:04:14.120> if<00:04:14.360> we<00:04:14.510> have<00:04:14.690> the<00:04:14.989> root

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:15.170 
and all that so if we have the root

00:04:15.170 --> 00:04:18.550 
and all that so if we have the root
fifth<00:04:15.530> we<00:04:16.370> have<00:04:16.489> seen<00:04:16.970> this<00:04:17.419> root<00:04:17.750> and<00:04:17.959> that<00:04:18.049> G

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:18.560 
fifth we have seen this root and that G

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:39.000 
fifth we have seen this root and that G
is<00:04:18.769> fifth<00:04:19.160> how<00:04:19.549> many<00:04:19.820> of<00:04:19.940> those<00:04:20.180> can<00:04:20.389> be<00:04:20.450> fine

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:39.010 

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:42.330 

an<00:04:39.790> OG<00:04:40.090> here<00:04:40.870> so<00:04:41.470> this<00:04:41.680> position<00:04:41.890> we<00:04:42.250> could

00:04:42.330 --> 00:04:42.340 
an OG here so this position we could

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:45.990 
an OG here so this position we could
play<00:04:42.550> the<00:04:42.790> bass<00:04:43.000> line<00:04:43.300> with<00:04:45.000> variations

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:46.000 
play the bass line with variations

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.250 
play the bass line with variations
because<00:04:46.120> we<00:04:46.420> can<00:04:46.540> take<00:04:46.750> the<00:04:46.900> root<00:04:47.050> note<00:04:47.230> and

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:47.260 
because we can take the root note and

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:50.520 
because we can take the root note and
the<00:04:47.530> fifth<00:04:47.770> part<00:04:48.100> of<00:04:48.310> the<00:04:48.490> fifth<00:04:48.730> below<00:04:49.530> then

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:50.530 
the fifth part of the fifth below then

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:54.390 
the fifth part of the fifth below then
we<00:04:50.800> can<00:04:50.920> also<00:04:52.140> go<00:04:53.140> to<00:04:53.170> the<00:04:53.410> next<00:04:53.620> position<00:04:53.920> here

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:54.400 
we can also go to the next position here

00:04:54.400 --> 00:05:13.130 
we can also go to the next position here
we<00:04:54.520> have<00:04:54.610> a<00:04:54.640> C<00:04:55.000> on<00:04:55.270> the<00:04:55.540> E<00:04:55.570> string
