00:00:05.899 --> 00:00:10.920
 Assalamu Alaikum is for the sake of ryan 

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.440
 Today I promised as promised 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:16.020
 Alena in the comments in my show you 

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.300
 how to tie a scarf with such 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.000
 border 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:22.310
 that's how it seems but very well 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.640
 bought this handkerchief 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:27.359
 he's light enough cotton 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.849
 fabrics 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.610
 that is, it will not be a pity for him in the summer due to 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:35.160
 the fact that she has a big enough size 

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:37.770
 it will turn out volumetric and enough 

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:40.649
 warm that is, the head and there will not be 

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:45.629
 and in general, everything is fine and fine action 

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:47.700
 you will like this shawl and japa 

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.039
 we take such a handkerchief 

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:53.940
 He basically as it turns out more 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:57.510
 so square long and wide 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.620
 I understand that this fabric is attacked 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.920
 edging along the edges 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:05.280
 we throw him on the head and to 

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:07.970
 one edge was shorter than the other one 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.710
 edge is shorter than length 

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:17.280
 Jano will be spreading pate badge 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:20.250
 cause I prick a step to start 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:21.570
 safe pin here sideways and behind 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.450
 heads so that he was more or less 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:27.299
 free and it was in the temple and we slaughter 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.100
 inside we got enough 

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:32.280
 freedom is now this edge which 

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:38.130
 in short we throw over the voice on 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:41.420
 so that our border was visible and here 

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:44.700
 this edge is also part of the take and 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:48.470
 toss over the head we get 

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.470
 such a light volume 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:55.170
 still legs mean now we 

00:01:52.649 --> 00:01:57.299
 here we have such a long edge 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.159
 take about the middle here 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:02.960
 this triangle capture beat 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:06.289
 zoom in on the middle and throw it in 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:06.289
 on the head 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:20.140
 so and now we have left here 

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:23.240
 Here is such an edge to it somehow 

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:26.630
 decorate it so that it does not hang 

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:33.400
 a triangle I take it here a little bit 

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:33.400
 100 edge and cling 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:45.400
 now you need to hook on a handkerchief with all 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:45.400
 countries so that it simply does not fly and 

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:55.010
 actually what we got behind 

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:57.200
 if you wear that head off something else 

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:59.360
 here our neck is closed 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:03.860
 that's what we got 

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:06.910
 such a good shawl sky moon where vodka 

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:10.310
 we used it as an extra 

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:12.530
