in<00:01:24.619> Nintendo<00:01:25.189> I'm<00:01:25.369> pretty<00:01:25.640> sure<00:01:25.790> they

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:25.939 
in Nintendo I'm pretty sure they

00:01:25.939 --> 00:01:27.399 
in Nintendo I'm pretty sure they
wouldn't<00:01:26.210> do<00:01:26.329> it<00:01:26.360> but<00:01:26.810> that's<00:01:26.960> one<00:01:27.200> thing<00:01:27.350> that

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:27.409 
wouldn't do it but that's one thing that

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:29.530 
wouldn't do it but that's one thing that
I<00:01:27.560> would<00:01:27.649> really<00:01:27.890> like<00:01:28.130> as<00:01:29.060> for<00:01:29.299> the<00:01:29.360> games

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:29.540 
I would really like as for the games

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:30.999 
I would really like as for the games
themselves<00:01:29.750> and<00:01:30.290> the<00:01:30.350> technology<00:01:30.649> in<00:01:30.950> general

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:31.009 
themselves and the technology in general

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:35.260 
themselves and the technology in general
I<00:01:31.520> think<00:01:31.720> the<00:01:32.720> games<00:01:32.930> for<00:01:33.380> it<00:01:33.409> should<00:01:34.310> be<00:01:34.460> 1080p

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:35.270 
I think the games for it should be 1080p

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:37.719 
I think the games for it should be 1080p
as<00:01:35.390> native<00:01:35.840> resolution<00:01:36.740> I<00:01:37.340> think<00:01:37.579> that's

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:37.729 
as native resolution I think that's

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:40.300 
as native resolution I think that's
pretty<00:01:37.939> much<00:01:38.180> a<00:01:38.479> necessity<00:01:38.810> now<00:01:39.530> almost

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:40.310 
pretty much a necessity now almost

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.580 
pretty much a necessity now almost

everyone has a HDTV and if you buy a HD
tele<00:01:43.040> now<00:01:43.280> it's<00:01:43.460> very<00:01:43.700> rare<00:01:43.969> that<00:01:44.000> it<00:01:44.210> weren't

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:57.279 
appropriate amount of frames per second
sometimes<00:01:55.579> it<00:01:55.729> looks<00:01:55.880> worse<00:01:56.180> than<00:01:56.420> 60<00:01:56.840> than<00:01:57.020> 30

00:01:57.279 --> 00:01:57.289 
sometimes it looks worse than 60 than 30

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:00.219 
sometimes it looks worse than 60 than 30
but<00:01:58.009> definitely<00:01:58.460> 1080p<00:01:58.969> native<00:01:59.360> I<00:01:59.600> think<00:02:00.170> that

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:00.229 
but definitely 1080p native I think that

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:02.289 
but definitely 1080p native I think that
should<00:02:00.530> be<00:02:00.590> a<00:02:00.710> given<00:02:00.920> as<00:02:01.549> for<00:02:01.850> the<00:02:01.909> controller

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:02.299 
should be a given as for the controller

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:04.389 
should be a given as for the controller
itself<00:02:02.750> this<00:02:03.350> is<00:02:03.500> more<00:02:03.740> aimed<00:02:03.950> towards

00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:04.399 
itself this is more aimed towards

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:06.340 
itself this is more aimed towards
developers<00:02:05.149> than<00:02:05.359> the<00:02:05.479> Nintendo<00:02:05.990> because<00:02:06.229> I'm

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
developers than the Nintendo because I'm

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.560 
developers than the Nintendo because I'm
no<00:02:06.469> Nintendo<00:02:07.009> will<00:02:07.159> do<00:02:07.310> this<00:02:07.460> but<00:02:07.789> third-party

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:08.570 
no Nintendo will do this but third-party

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:10.660 
no Nintendo will do this but third-party
developers<00:02:09.020> may<00:02:09.170> not<00:02:09.410> and<00:02:09.619> that's<00:02:09.800> utilized

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:10.670 
developers may not and that's utilized

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.600 
developers may not and that's utilized
the<00:02:11.450> tablet<00:02:11.870> to<00:02:12.050> its<00:02:12.170> full<00:02:12.350> potential<00:02:12.650> similar

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:13.610 
the tablet to its full potential similar

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:15.820 
the tablet to its full potential similar
to<00:02:13.760> what<00:02:13.940> the<00:02:14.300> d/s<00:02:14.660> was<00:02:14.900> like<00:02:15.110> when<00:02:15.590> two

00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:15.830 
to what the d/s was like when two

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:17.070 
to what the d/s was like when two
screens<00:02:16.160> first<00:02:16.400> came<00:02:16.730> out

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
screens first came out

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.600 
screens first came out
people<00:02:18.080> were<00:02:18.200> unsure<00:02:18.590> what<00:02:19.010> to<00:02:19.040> think<00:02:19.310> of<00:02:19.459> it

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:19.610 
people were unsure what to think of it

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:21.640 
people were unsure what to think of it
but<00:02:20.330> then<00:02:20.480> developers<00:02:20.989> really<00:02:21.140> started

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 
but then developers really started

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.940 
but then developers really started
taking<00:02:22.340> advantage<00:02:22.880> of<00:02:23.180> the<00:02:23.989> extra<00:02:24.170> screen<00:02:24.680> and

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:24.950 
taking advantage of the extra screen and

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:27.040 
taking advantage of the extra screen and
not<00:02:25.069> just<00:02:25.250> using<00:02:25.550> it<00:02:25.640> as<00:02:25.700> a<00:02:25.760> map<00:02:26.030> and<00:02:26.330> we<00:02:26.750> really

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050 
not just using it as a map and we really

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:28.930 
not just using it as a map and we really
saw<00:02:27.200> some<00:02:27.500> great<00:02:27.709> games<00:02:27.920> that<00:02:28.280> weren't<00:02:28.580> able

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:28.940 
saw some great games that weren't able

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:31.240 
saw some great games that weren't able
to<00:02:29.390> be<00:02:29.510> done<00:02:29.690> on<00:02:29.870> any<00:02:30.080> of<00:02:30.290> the<00:02:30.470> gaming<00:02:31.220> machine

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
to be done on any of the gaming machine

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.610 
to be done on any of the gaming machine
so<00:02:32.180> I'd<00:02:32.300> like<00:02:32.450> to<00:02:32.569> see<00:02:32.660> something<00:02:33.020> similar<00:02:33.230> on

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:33.620 
so I'd like to see something similar on

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.610 
so I'd like to see something similar on
the<00:02:33.800> wii<00:02:33.980> u<00:02:34.220> where<00:02:34.840> we<00:02:35.840> see<00:02:36.019> a<00:02:36.050> lot<00:02:36.290> of<00:02:36.319> games

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:36.620 
the wii u where we see a lot of games

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.570 
the wii u where we see a lot of games
that<00:02:36.860> only<00:02:37.489> that<00:02:37.849> we<00:02:37.970> you<00:02:38.209> can<00:02:38.450> do<00:02:38.630> that<00:02:39.319> right

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:39.580 
that only that we you can do that right

00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:42.190 
that only that we you can do that right
that's<00:02:40.580> probably<00:02:41.480> one<00:02:41.930> of<00:02:41.959> the<00:02:42.110> most

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
that's probably one of the most

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.650 
that's probably one of the most
important<00:02:42.769> points<00:02:43.040> for<00:02:43.190> me<00:02:43.310> really<00:02:44.120> try<00:02:44.630> and

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:44.660 
important points for me really try and

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.210 
important points for me really try and
distinguish<00:02:45.290> yourself<00:02:45.440> from<00:02:45.739> the<00:02:45.950> crowd

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:46.220 
distinguish yourself from the crowd

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.120 
distinguish yourself from the crowd
because<00:02:47.120> that's<00:02:47.540> what<00:02:47.720> made<00:02:47.959> that<00:02:48.230> we<00:02:48.470> sell<00:02:48.860> so

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:49.130 
because that's what made that we sell so

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.850 
because that's what made that we sell so
many<00:02:49.160> consoles<00:02:49.850> to<00:02:50.720> begin<00:02:50.989> with<00:02:51.200> as<00:02:51.500> for<00:02:51.799> the

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:51.860 
many consoles to begin with as for the

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:54.520 
many consoles to begin with as for the
tablet<00:02:52.190> controller<00:02:52.459> itself<00:02:52.970> I'd<00:02:53.299> say<00:02:54.049> the

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:54.530 
tablet controller itself I'd say the

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:57.460 
tablet controller itself I'd say the
design<00:02:54.860> is<00:02:55.130> pretty<00:02:55.850> much<00:02:56.420> I<00:02:56.840> wouldn't<00:02:57.230> say

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:57.470 
design is pretty much I wouldn't say

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:59.680 
design is pretty much I wouldn't say
flawless<00:02:58.010> but<00:02:58.220> it's<00:02:58.459> fine<00:02:58.760> all<00:02:59.330> that<00:02:59.600> I<00:02:59.630> would

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690 
flawless but it's fine all that I would

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:02.800 
flawless but it's fine all that I would
say<00:02:59.959> is<00:02:59.989> make<00:03:00.680> the<00:03:01.120> circle<00:03:02.120> pads<00:03:02.330> or<00:03:02.690> the

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
say is make the circle pads or the

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:04.420 
say is make the circle pads or the
thumbsticks<00:03:03.319> clickable<00:03:03.860> because<00:03:04.190> at<00:03:04.340> the

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:04.430 
thumbsticks clickable because at the

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:06.610 
thumbsticks clickable because at the
moment<00:03:04.459> they're<00:03:04.819> not<00:03:05.000> I<00:03:05.150> believe<00:03:05.510> and<00:03:05.720> if<00:03:06.380> they

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:06.620 
moment they're not I believe and if they

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:08.559 
moment they're not I believe and if they
really<00:03:06.799> want<00:03:07.130> to<00:03:07.220> try<00:03:07.489> and<00:03:07.670> bring<00:03:07.940> hardcore

00:03:08.559 --> 00:03:08.569 
really want to try and bring hardcore

00:03:08.569 --> 00:03:11.199 
really want to try and bring hardcore
games<00:03:09.200> back<00:03:09.620> to<00:03:09.920> Nintendo<00:03:10.430> machines<00:03:10.819> then

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:11.209 
games back to Nintendo machines then

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:14.140 
games back to Nintendo machines then
they<00:03:11.390> need<00:03:11.540> to<00:03:11.780> put<00:03:12.200> those<00:03:12.349> on<00:03:12.590> because<00:03:13.150> that's

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
they need to put those on because that's

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:15.759 
they need to put those on because that's
two<00:03:14.360> buttons<00:03:14.690> lost<00:03:14.959> and<00:03:15.260> they're<00:03:15.560> too

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:15.769 
two buttons lost and they're too

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:17.650 
two buttons lost and they're too
frequently<00:03:16.310> used<00:03:16.549> buttons<00:03:16.910> as<00:03:17.060> well<00:03:17.239> for

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:17.660 
frequently used buttons as well for

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:20.440 
frequently used buttons as well for
shooters<00:03:18.440> and<00:03:18.650> whatnot<00:03:18.980> so<00:03:19.549> keeping<00:03:20.120> them<00:03:20.299> out

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:20.450 
shooters and whatnot so keeping them out

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:22.479 
shooters and whatnot so keeping them out
would<00:03:20.840> kind<00:03:21.109> of<00:03:21.230> put<00:03:21.709> themselves<00:03:22.160> at<00:03:22.370> a

00:03:22.479 --> 00:03:22.489 
would kind of put themselves at a

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:25.090 
would kind of put themselves at a
disadvantage<00:03:22.700> not<00:03:23.209> a<00:03:23.480> major<00:03:23.720> one<00:03:23.900> but<00:03:24.410> one<00:03:24.829> on

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:25.100 
disadvantage not a major one but one on

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:27.849 
disadvantage not a major one but one on
the<00:03:25.250> west<00:03:25.400> a<00:03:25.730> lot<00:03:26.180> of<00:03:26.329> Inklings<00:03:27.140> in<00:03:27.650> the

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:27.859 
the west a lot of Inklings in the

00:03:27.859 --> 00:03:30.400 
the west a lot of Inklings in the
Nintendo<00:03:28.400> side<00:03:28.640> of<00:03:28.820> things<00:03:29.000> reckon<00:03:29.570> that<00:03:29.930> you

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 
Nintendo side of things reckon that you

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:32.319 
Nintendo side of things reckon that you
can<00:03:30.560> only<00:03:30.709> use<00:03:30.829> one<00:03:30.950> tablet<00:03:31.459> per<00:03:31.670> console

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:32.329 
can only use one tablet per console

00:03:32.329 --> 00:03:35.140 
can only use one tablet per console
which<00:03:32.690> I<00:03:32.870> think<00:03:33.170> would<00:03:33.680> be<00:03:33.920> a<00:03:34.130> massive<00:03:34.760> mistake

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:35.150 
which I think would be a massive mistake

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.809 
which I think would be a massive mistake
and<00:03:35.650> use<00:03:36.650> it<00:03:36.829> being<00:03:37.130> able<00:03:37.370> to<00:03:37.459> use<00:03:37.489> at<00:03:37.790> least

00:03:37.809 --> 00:03:37.819 
and use it being able to use at least

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:40.900 
and use it being able to use at least
two<00:03:38.090> if<00:03:38.630> not<00:03:38.900> for<00:03:38.959> would<00:03:39.890> be<00:03:40.069> such<00:03:40.730> an

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 
two if not for would be such an

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:43.150 
two if not for would be such an
incredible<00:03:41.390> gaming<00:03:41.750> experience<00:03:42.200> I<00:03:42.319> think<00:03:42.350> the

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:43.160 
incredible gaming experience I think the

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:45.370 
incredible gaming experience I think the
reason<00:03:43.370> is<00:03:43.700> that<00:03:43.760> the<00:03:44.510> tablets<00:03:44.900> probably<00:03:45.170> cost

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:45.380 
reason is that the tablets probably cost

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:46.539 
reason is that the tablets probably cost
too<00:03:45.560> much<00:03:45.590> to<00:03:45.769> buy<00:03:46.010> as<00:03:46.069> a<00:03:46.250> standalone

00:03:46.539 --> 00:03:46.549 
too much to buy as a standalone

00:03:46.549 --> 00:03:48.490 
too much to buy as a standalone
controller<00:03:47.150> which<00:03:47.690> is<00:03:47.840> fair<00:03:48.049> enough<00:03:48.079> I

00:03:48.490 --> 00:03:48.500 
controller which is fair enough I

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.800 
controller which is fair enough I
understand<00:03:49.100> that<00:03:49.280> part<00:03:49.549> but<00:03:49.970> consider<00:03:50.660> the

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:50.810 
understand that part but consider the

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:53.289 
understand that part but consider the
fact<00:03:51.049> that<00:03:51.170> we<00:03:51.470> have<00:03:51.590> friends<00:03:52.069> nearby<00:03:52.549> they

00:03:53.289 --> 00:03:53.299 
fact that we have friends nearby they

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:55.479 
fact that we have friends nearby they
also<00:03:53.510> have<00:03:53.870> a<00:03:53.900> wii<00:03:54.170> u<00:03:54.410> so<00:03:54.680> we<00:03:54.829> have<00:03:55.190> a<00:03:55.250> tablet

00:03:55.479 --> 00:03:55.489

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:11.389 
teeth on the television i think that

00:04:11.389 --> 00:04:14.559 
teeth on the television i think that
would<00:04:11.480> be<00:04:11.660> really<00:04:11.870> awesome<00:04:12.819> obviously<00:04:13.819> not

00:04:14.559 --> 00:04:14.569 
would be really awesome obviously not

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:17.140 
would be really awesome obviously not
just<00:04:14.810> in<00:04:14.930> FPS<00:04:15.380> is<00:04:15.650> but<00:04:16.010> in<00:04:16.250> other<00:04:16.549> genres<00:04:16.639> as

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:17.150 
just in FPS is but in other genres as

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:19.310 
just in FPS is but in other genres as
well<00:04:17.329> they<00:04:17.510> could<00:04:17.660> really<00:04:17.989> utilize<00:04:18.200> doing

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:19.320 
well they could really utilize doing

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:21.650 
well they could really utilize doing
something<00:04:20.130> like<00:04:20.280> Zelda<00:04:20.700> for<00:04:20.910> salt<00:04:21.180> would<00:04:21.510> be

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:21.660 
something like Zelda for salt would be

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:23.600 
something like Zelda for salt would be
incredible<00:04:22.140> on<00:04:22.290> that<00:04:22.470> so<00:04:22.890> at<00:04:23.160> least<00:04:23.310> make<00:04:23.580> it

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:23.610 
incredible on that so at least make it

00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:25.940 
incredible on that so at least make it
two<00:04:23.970> per<00:04:24.180> console<00:04:24.660> for<00:04:24.870> me<00:04:25.020> as<00:04:25.380> much<00:04:25.590> as<00:04:25.800> people

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:25.950 
two per console for me as much as people

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:28.220 
two per console for me as much as people
would<00:04:26.220> have<00:04:26.400> you<00:04:26.550> believe<00:04:26.780> local<00:04:27.780> multiplayer

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:28.230 
would have you believe local multiplayer

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:29.840 
would have you believe local multiplayer
still<00:04:28.530> does<00:04:28.710> exist<00:04:29.070> and<00:04:29.220> it<00:04:29.490> still<00:04:29.670> is

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:29.850 
still does exist and it still is

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:32.570 
still does exist and it still is
probably<00:04:30.600> the<00:04:30.750> best<00:04:30.900> type<00:04:31.140> of<00:04:31.170> multiplayer<00:04:31.740> in

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:32.580 
probably the best type of multiplayer in

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:35.390 
probably the best type of multiplayer in

64 obviously an updated version
something<00:04:46.980> like<00:04:47.130> f-zero<00:04:47.310> would<00:04:47.910> work<00:04:48.090> well<00:04:48.300> I

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:48.360 
something like f-zero would work well I

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.410 
something like f-zero would work well I
think<00:04:48.480> of<00:04:49.190> Professor<00:04:50.190> Layton<00:04:50.340> definitely<00:04:50.670> but

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:51.420 
think of Professor Layton definitely but

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:52.850 
think of Professor Layton definitely but
there<00:04:51.570> needs<00:04:51.690> to<00:04:51.870> be<00:04:51.900> at<00:04:52.110> least<00:04:52.140> one<00:04:52.500> killer

00:04:52.850 --> 00:04:52.860 
there needs to be at least one killer

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:55.350 
app at launch from Nintendo because they

00:04:55.350 --> 00:04:57.380 
app at launch from Nintendo because they
can't<00:04:55.560> rely<00:04:55.830> on<00:04:55.860> third<00:04:56.160> parties<00:04:56.670> to<00:04:56.700> make<00:04:57.360> a

00:04:57.380 --> 00:04:57.390 
can't rely on third parties to make a

00:04:57.390 --> 00:04:59.330 
can't rely on third parties to make a
system<00:04:57.930> seller<00:04:58.200> at<00:04:58.380> launch<00:04:58.620> because<00:04:59.160> it<00:04:59.220> never

00:04:59.330 --> 00:04:59.340 
system seller at launch because it never

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.100 
system seller at launch because it never
works<00:04:59.640> that<00:04:59.880> way<00:05:00.030> with<00:05:00.450> third<00:05:00.690> parties<00:05:01.080> in

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.110 
works that way with third parties in

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:04.160 
works that way with third parties in
mind<00:05:01.440> I<00:05:01.680> would<00:05:01.800> say<00:05:02.100> Nintendo<00:05:02.850> make<00:05:03.780> sure<00:05:03.990> your

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:04.170 
mind I would say Nintendo make sure your

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:06.320 
mind I would say Nintendo make sure your
third-party<00:05:04.380> support<00:05:05.010> is<00:05:05.190> much<00:05:05.850> better<00:05:06.150> this

00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:06.330 
third-party support is much better this

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:08.510 
third-party support is much better this
generation<00:05:07.020> because<00:05:07.590> that<00:05:08.040> we<00:05:08.220> was

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:08.520 
generation because that we was

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:10.550 
generation because that we was
incredibly<00:05:09.360> lacking<00:05:09.720> in<00:05:09.810> third-party<00:05:10.230> games

00:05:10.550 --> 00:05:10.560 
incredibly lacking in third-party games

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.830 
incredibly lacking in third-party games
it<00:05:11.160> always<00:05:11.490> got<00:05:11.640> the<00:05:11.760> watered-down<00:05:12.120> version

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:12.840 
it always got the watered-down version

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:15.470 
it always got the watered-down version
of<00:05:12.960> any<00:05:13.080> popular<00:05:13.620> games<00:05:13.860> and<00:05:14.250> it<00:05:15.000> missed<00:05:15.300> out

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:15.480 
of any popular games and it missed out

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:17.570 
of any popular games and it missed out
on<00:05:15.510> so<00:05:15.900> many<00:05:16.080> good<00:05:16.410> games<00:05:16.620> due<00:05:17.280> to<00:05:17.460> the

00:05:17.570 --> 00:05:17.580 
on so many good games due to the

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:19.850 
on so many good games due to the
technical<00:05:18.000> limitations<00:05:18.720> I'd<00:05:19.230> say<00:05:19.530> while

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:19.860 
technical limitations I'd say while

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:22.220 
technical limitations I'd say while
you've<00:05:20.430> got<00:05:20.610> this<00:05:20.760> brief<00:05:21.120> period<00:05:21.630> where<00:05:22.080> the

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:22.230 
you've got this brief period where the

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:25.340 
you've got this brief period where the
Wii<00:05:22.410> U<00:05:22.650> is<00:05:22.800> out<00:05:22.980> before<00:05:23.370> the<00:05:24.240> xbox<00:05:24.630> 720<00:05:25.080> and

Wii U is out before the xbox 720 and

PlayStation 4 get every big hit of it

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:31.390 
PlayStation 4 get every big hit of it
you<00:05:27.900> can<00:05:28.110> so<00:05:28.440> like<00:05:28.860> GTA<00:05:29.550> 5<00:05:29.910> Assassin's<00:05:30.840> Creed<00:05:31.110> 3

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:31.400 
you can so like GTA 5 Assassin's Creed 3

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:33.560 
you can so like GTA 5 Assassin's Creed 3

listed<00:07:22.670> are<00:07:23.000> all<00:07:23.180> very<00:07:23.420> much<00:07:23.710> feasible

00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:24.710 
listed are all very much feasible

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:27.220 
listed are all very much feasible

00:07:27.220 --> 00:07:27.230 
there's nothing but out of the realms of

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:30.340 
there's nothing but out of the realms of
possibility<00:07:27.400> it<00:07:28.400> would<00:07:28.670> only<00:07:28.790> help<00:07:29.240> to<00:07:29.630> make

00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:30.350 
possibility it would only help to make

00:07:30.350 --> 00:07:32.260 
possibility it would only help to make
Nintendo<00:07:30.980> a<00:07:31.010> major<00:07:31.280> force<00:07:31.640> which<00:07:32.090> they

Nintendo a major force which they

00:07:32.270 --> 00:07:33.490 
Nintendo a major force which they
already<00:07:32.420> are<00:07:32.630> but<00:07:32.930> they<00:07:33.080> kind<00:07:33.290> of<00:07:33.350> been

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:33.500

already are but they kind of been
slipping<00:07:33.950> the<00:07:34.190> last<00:07:34.400> year<00:07:34.670> or<00:07:34.850> so<00:07:34.880> so<00:07:35.480> I'd<00:07:35.630> love
