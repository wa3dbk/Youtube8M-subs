00:00:53.479 --> 00:00:53.489 
some reason all of the vans I looked at

00:00:53.489 --> 00:01:00.049 
some reason all of the vans I looked at
had<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:53.820> same<00:00:54.030> systems<00:00:54.570> as<00:00:54.809> my<00:00:55.050> old<00:00:55.230> van<00:00:58.820> in<00:00:59.820> my

hours of mobile power the problem is

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.190 
hours of mobile power the problem is
I've<00:01:08.520> got<00:01:08.729> to<00:01:08.850> charge<00:01:09.090> these<00:01:09.420> batteries<00:01:09.450> and

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
I've got to charge these batteries and

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.600 
I've got to charge these batteries and
keep<00:01:10.380> them<00:01:10.530> in<00:01:10.650> great<00:01:10.860> condition<00:01:11.369> this<00:01:11.490> will

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
keep them in great condition this will

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.570 
keep them in great condition this will
also<00:01:11.790> make<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.119> batteries<00:01:12.479> last<00:01:12.720> longer

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:13.580 
also make the batteries last longer

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.149 
also make the batteries last longer
adding<00:01:14.580> a<00:01:14.670> good<00:01:14.880> 240<00:01:15.570> volt<00:01:15.810> smart<00:01:16.439> charger<00:01:16.979> for

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
adding a good 240 volt smart charger for

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.560 
adding a good 240 volt smart charger for
when<00:01:17.280> the<00:01:17.369> van<00:01:17.520> is<00:01:17.670> parked<00:01:17.700> up<00:01:18.180> that's<00:01:18.450> a

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
when the van is parked up that's a

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.050 
when the van is parked up that's a
no-brainer<00:01:18.750> a<00:01:19.320> smart<00:01:20.070> charger<00:01:20.580> charges<00:01:21.030> a

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
no-brainer a smart charger charges a

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.240 
no-brainer a smart charger charges a
batteries<00:01:21.509> in<00:01:21.659> stages<00:01:22.290> which<00:01:22.590> enables<00:01:23.100> them

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:23.250 
batteries in stages which enables them

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.100 
batteries in stages which enables them
to<00:01:23.280> be<00:01:23.460> fully<00:01:23.700> charged<00:01:24.180> but<00:01:24.360> not<00:01:24.540> overcharged

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:25.110 
to be fully charged but not overcharged

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.890 
to be fully charged but not overcharged
I<00:01:25.549> also<00:01:26.549> want<00:01:26.970> to<00:01:27.030> be<00:01:27.180> able<00:01:27.270> to<00:01:27.420> charge<00:01:27.630> the

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
I also want to be able to charge the

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.160 
I also want to be able to charge the
batteries<00:01:28.259> whilst<00:01:28.500> driving<00:01:29.240> most<00:01:30.240> vans<00:01:30.570> the
