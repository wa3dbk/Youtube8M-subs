00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:05.120
 The Telecommunications University Research Group 

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:09.239
 Soft touch panel with LCD and photoelasticity 

00:00:09.239 --> 00:00:12.160
 We are conducting research aimed at realizing it 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.660
 Using this technology for video content 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:19.360
 Give a sense of three-dimensional and soft touch 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:21.040
 It will be possible 

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:25.329
 The traditional touch screen is 

00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:26.829
 Tactile when touched 

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:27.589
 Feedback is 

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:29.600
 Because there is not 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:31.550
 For example, in entertainment 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.900
 It's like playing in direct contact with the character 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:37.700
 Even if you made the content 

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.500
 There was a problem that there was no tactile sense of fun 

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.110
 But such a soft touch 

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:48.120
 Such a three-dimensional shape 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.620
 By putting out with touch panel using gel 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.500
 Content that is more fun to touch 

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.150
 Can be made 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:01.600
 This system is a camera and a polarizing plate 

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.420
 It consists of a liquid crystal display 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.570
 Because the liquid crystal display is always polarized 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:10.409
 Use a polarizing plate to make an image 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:13.309
 You can shut off completely 

00:01:13.309 --> 00:01:16.500
 Therefore, between the polarizing plate and the liquid crystal display 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.609
 Put transparent gel and give power to transparent gel 

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:23.400
 A phenomenon occurs that changes the nature of polarization 

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.909
 Light passes through the polarizer 

00:01:25.909 --> 00:01:28.509
 Then pressure was applied to the transparent gel 

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:31.100
 Only the part looks shiny 

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.709
 By capturing this light with a camera 

00:01:33.709 --> 00:01:37.659
 Detecting the touched position, strength, etc. 

00:01:37.659 --> 00:01:40.759
 In the current system of this display 

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:43.290
 I'm using the upper camera 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.999
 In our newly developed system this time 

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:50.189
 The camera behind the display 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.119
 It can be installed and there is no camera on top 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.610
 It is possible to detect touch on the same principle 

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.309
 Because it became possible 

00:01:58.309 --> 00:02:02.269
 It does not mean that you need a camera above 

00:02:03.429 --> 00:02:07.369
 The shape of the transparent gel is not particularly limited 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:10.259
 In addition to "touch" and "push" 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:12.719
 The action of "pulling" and "cutting" is also 

00:02:12.719 --> 00:02:15.729
 It is detectable by multi touch 

00:02:15.729 --> 00:02:21.480
 For example, create a life-size human shape with an elastic body 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.669
 Considering the application of the medical field 

00:02:24.669 --> 00:02:28.880
 For example, massage or shiatsu 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.070
 I used an action that actually applies force and deforms 

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:35.709
 It is a medical simulator 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:36.830
 Applied to such things 

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:40.409
 I think I can do it
