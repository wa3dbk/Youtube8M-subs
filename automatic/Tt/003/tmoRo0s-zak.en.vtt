00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:10.740
 payments will be 60 million years old and all 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.820
 this time they adapt to 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.530
 changing conditions 

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.599
 that's why scientists were so upset 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:18.510
 after learning that how many fleas carry 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:21.119
 insecticides likely blocks would serve 

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:24.529
 even in the case of atomic war besides 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.529
 blocks very ingeniously 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.600
 fur fleas live in hair 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:49.030
 magnified hundreds of times under electronic 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:51.210
 a flea microscope looks like this 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:54.190
 We strive to comrade denigrate 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:56.170
 spend almost all their lives on dogs 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:58.260
 and cats are constantly moving around their 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:58.260
 body 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:08.900
 himself arrogance 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.060
 some types of block in the main block 

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:15.920
 rodents living on their bodies 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:18.170
 only at the time of the meal of others example 

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:21.979
 prefabricated blocks wilt under the skin of their 

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:24.200
 victims and there they live and die when 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:28.180
 cat flea breeds she needs 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.180
 in constant replenishment of blood 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:33.979
 severe cases of infection is 

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:36.200
 can cause death to the dog's victim and 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:38.979
 cats and even a large mammal to 

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.979
 Calf example 

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:56.010
 in Los Angeles through the magic eyepiece 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.140
 electron microscope invented 

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:03.750
 by david we can see endlessly 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:05.580
 small forms magnified 60000 times david 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.710
 engineer photographer he managed to connect 

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:12.120
 medical technology with electronic 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:14.100
 photos laha placed vacuum 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.740
 electron microscope space them 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:18.630
 her movement is fixed and painted 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:21.020
 manually or using a graphic 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.020
 palette 

00:02:28.490 --> 00:02:33.030
 about 11 years old I made my own 

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:36.390
 first photos through a microscope 

00:02:33.030 --> 00:02:38.130
 handheld camera I studied physics and became 

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:40.200
 an electronics engineer after which I 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:41.730
 worked with scanning electronic 

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:46.950
 microscopes in the learning process 

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:48.959
 used them did not say that it is impossible 

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:50.880
 put a living thing or wet 

00:02:48.959 --> 00:02:53.130
 subject vacuum space because 

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:55.380
 so that you can mess up the tool i 

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:57.420
 discovered that live unprotected objects 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:59.640
 and incomparably better dead creatures and 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:02.480
 it turned out that fleas are among the most 

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:02.480
 interesting after 

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.670
 photos block made and david 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:20.349
 famous to the whole world do not see that 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:21.280
 reality may be more interesting 

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:23.709
 any fiction 

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:27.000
 Now such photos of the usual work of the new 

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:27.000
 generations of entomologists 

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:52.549
 upon closer inspection of the blokhin 

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:55.280
 remember aliens them definitely have 

00:03:52.549 --> 00:03:58.780
 all the strange features that are needed 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.780
 for survival in an alien environment 

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:14.859
 the unit has an antenna located right 

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:16.930
 above the eyes of the males with the ocean except 

00:04:14.859 --> 00:04:18.639
 precisely sucker chips which 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:21.600
 increases in mating patterns and 

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:21.600
 hold himself 

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:24.910
 their tight month is also a kind of son 

00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:25.300
 every movement of the air is delivered 

00:05:24.910 --> 00:05:27.070
 throat 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:29.620
 looking for a victim to me such a position 

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:32.220
 that is why the flea is able to go off 

00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:32.220
 to calculate
