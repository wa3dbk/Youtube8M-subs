really like really completely natural

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:34.780 
really like really completely natural
products<00:03:33.290> they<00:03:34.040> definitely<00:03:34.489> have<00:03:34.580> something

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:34.790 
products they definitely have something

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:36.610 
products they definitely have something
for<00:03:35.000> you<00:03:35.150> I<00:03:35.300> do<00:03:35.510> again<00:03:35.989> say<00:03:36.170> that<00:03:36.380> this<00:03:36.470> is

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:36.620 
for you I do again say that this is

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:38.229 
for you I do again say that this is
better<00:03:36.830> for<00:03:37.100> more<00:03:37.220> mature<00:03:37.400> or<00:03:37.760> more<00:03:37.910> advanced

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:38.239 
better for more mature or more advanced

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:40.120 
better for more mature or more advanced
signs<00:03:38.480> and<00:03:39.230> again<00:03:39.440> because<00:03:39.650> it<00:03:39.739> is<00:03:39.830> a<00:03:39.860> thicker

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:40.130 
signs and again because it is a thicker

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:41.710 
signs and again because it is a thicker
texture<00:03:40.610> and<00:03:40.790> then<00:03:41.030> this<00:03:41.209> one<00:03:41.390> would<00:03:41.480> be<00:03:41.600> your

00:03:41.710 --> 00:03:41.720 
texture and then this one would be your

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:43.540 
texture and then this one would be your
more<00:03:41.900> preventative<00:03:42.410> product<00:03:42.800> this<00:03:43.190> one<00:03:43.370> goes

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:43.550 
more preventative product this one goes

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:46.360 
more preventative product this one goes
for<00:03:43.580> approximately<00:03:44.209> $54<00:03:44.930> Canadian<00:03:45.320> I<00:03:45.530> think

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:46.370 
for approximately $54 Canadian I think

00:03:46.370 --> 00:03:47.440 
for approximately $54 Canadian I think
the<00:03:46.459> treatment<00:03:46.700> version<00:03:47.090> is<00:03:47.180> the<00:03:47.300> lighter

00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:47.450 
the treatment version is the lighter

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:48.940 
the treatment version is the lighter
texture<00:03:47.810> would<00:03:48.200> probably<00:03:48.470> be<00:03:48.530> better<00:03:48.680> for<00:03:48.890> a

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:48.950 
texture would probably be better for a

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:50.320 
texture would probably be better for a
younger<00:03:49.100> skin<00:03:49.400> I<00:03:49.430> haven't<00:03:49.760> really<00:03:49.940> dug<00:03:50.120> into

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:50.330 
younger skin I haven't really dug into

00:03:50.330 --> 00:03:52.270 
younger skin I haven't really dug into
this<00:03:50.510> one<00:03:50.690> so<00:03:50.870> much<00:03:50.900> but<00:03:51.590> it<00:03:51.680> is<00:03:51.709> quite<00:03:52.070> nice

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
this one so much but it is quite nice

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:53.920 
this one so much but it is quite nice
and<00:03:52.489> it<00:03:52.580> does<00:03:52.760> smell<00:03:52.940> very<00:03:53.120> good<00:03:53.239> as<00:03:53.480> well<00:03:53.630> and

00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:53.930 
and it does smell very good as well and

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:56.650 
and it does smell very good as well and
