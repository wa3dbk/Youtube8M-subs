plan on playing game boy advance games i

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.530 
plan on playing game boy advance games i
recommend<00:01:04.890> you<00:01:04.949> get<00:01:05.100> a<00:01:05.129> gameboy<00:01:05.549> player<00:01:05.820> also

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
recommend you get a gameboy player also

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.840 
recommend you get a gameboy player also
if<00:01:06.780> you<00:01:06.900> have<00:01:07.020> a<00:01:07.049> gamecube<00:01:07.350> because<00:01:08.040> it's<00:01:08.700> just

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
if you have a gamecube because it's just

else you gonna impale yourself with

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.350 
else you gonna impale yourself with
non-retractable<00:01:16.590> spikes<00:01:17.220> that<00:01:17.430> time<00:01:17.729> i<00:01:17.970> guess

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
non-retractable spikes that time i guess

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.100 
non-retractable spikes that time i guess
those<00:01:18.509> work<00:01:18.810> just<00:01:19.110> as<00:01:19.290> well<00:01:19.320> i<00:01:20.630> will<00:01:21.630> talk<00:01:21.900> to

the doctor ah later about that oh man

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.510 
the doctor ah later about that oh man
that<00:01:25.020> could<00:01:25.259> have<00:01:25.350> been<00:01:25.500> bad<00:01:25.560> too<00:01:26.009> i<00:01:26.040> wasn't

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:33.410 
a bubble over there maybe i should get
that<00:01:32.100> bubble<00:01:32.400> real<00:01:32.579> quick<00:01:32.820> before<00:01:32.970> I<00:01:33.150> go<00:01:33.210> up

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:33.420 
that bubble real quick before I go up

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:35.690 
that bubble real quick before I go up
any<00:01:33.630> further<00:01:33.869> hello<00:01:34.710> bubble<00:01:35.040> pouch<00:01:35.250> how's<00:01:35.640> it

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
any further hello bubble pouch how's it

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.080 
any further hello bubble pouch how's it
going<00:01:36.020> yeah<00:01:37.020> I<00:01:37.829> almost<00:01:37.979> died<00:01:38.430> there<00:01:38.700> I<00:01:38.850> mean<00:01:39.030> I

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
going yeah I almost died there I mean I

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:41.749 
going yeah I almost died there I mean I
started<00:01:39.479> to<00:01:39.570> die<00:01:39.720> and<00:01:40.020> higher<00:01:40.979> jumps<00:01:41.549> because

00:01:41.749 --> 00:01:41.759 
started to die and higher jumps because

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:44.389 
started to die and higher jumps because
of<00:01:42.240> water<00:01:42.540> physics<00:01:43.229> and<00:01:43.829> I<00:01:43.920> think<00:01:44.159> this<00:01:44.250> will

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
of water physics and I think this will

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.609 
of water physics and I think this will
take<00:01:44.579> me<00:01:44.759> out<00:01:44.909> of<00:01:45.060> the<00:01:45.119> water<00:01:45.270> or<00:01:46.020> it<00:01:46.380> won't

00:01:46.609 --> 00:01:46.619 
take me out of the water or it won't

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:48.410 
take me out of the water or it won't
maybe<00:01:47.250> I<00:01:47.369> should've<00:01:47.670> got<00:01:47.790> that<00:01:47.970> bubble<00:01:48.299> whoa

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
maybe I should've got that bubble whoa

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.359 
maybe I should've got that bubble whoa
we<00:01:48.570> got<00:01:48.600> electric<00:01:49.079> jellyfish<00:01:49.590> here<00:01:49.890> I'm<00:01:50.159> sure

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
we got electric jellyfish here I'm sure

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:51.859 
we got electric jellyfish here I'm sure
he's<00:01:50.520> invulnerable<00:01:50.970> when<00:01:51.479> he's<00:01:51.689> all

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
he's invulnerable when he's all
