00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:04.900
 How are we friends? There is a locker. 

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:08.109
 occasion is to make a small video 

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:09.630
 video tutorial what to look for when they go 

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:11.679
 to acquire a computer unfortunately 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:14.410
 currently they are selling to many 

00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:16.839
 equipment with icloud that is a cloud is 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:18.189
 what I'm going to show you what many 

00:00:16.839 --> 00:00:20.220
 sometimes they give us the equipment so 

00:00:18.189 --> 00:00:22.380
 is to activate it 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.420
 We have our team that we have 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:28.980
 what to put our chip to activate 

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:32.360
 We do the steps that are in Spanish 

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:34.800
 country we already selected the wifi account 

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:37.470
 and when we want to do it gives us the 

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.020
 surprise to activate this phone 

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:41.340
 we have to put the account data 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:43.260
 and password 

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:45.660
 you have to be very careful with 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:48.629
 this since these data can not be 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.519
 remove there are some tutorials on the internet 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:52.350
 they are here they have the iphone 4 but 

00:00:50.519 --> 00:00:55.019
 even so, if you take them away they are useless 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.879
 because the equipment is not activated when 

00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:59.400
 want to connect itunes to that kind of 

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:01.860
 equipment does not serve you, it's time to 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:05.160
 serve the phone and useless does not serve you 

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:07.590
 of nothing or what is something very bad that is 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:10.619
 happening because now they are 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:12.600
 seeing the face a lot of people a team like that 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.909
 it does not help you 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:18.330
 so it's a nice paperweight or something 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.979
 so we are in what we can good 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.680
 we have the service of power girls if 

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:25.350
 have this function activated what 

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:27.330
 we occupy is to send us the email 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.210
 your team to be able to tell you the 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:32.670
 company to which it belongs and if it has or 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:35.580
 does not have this type of padlock what 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:37.920
 first give up here for a click 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:40.799
 that this screen of salou and 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.960
 here is not the letter and we will give 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:45.409
 click here comes what is the email 

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.149
 from our team 

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:50.159
 the email or we can here we can here 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.319
 this number is what we need that 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:55.710
 send us the email with this number 

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:58.710
 We can verify which company and if 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.630
 has or does not have these types of locks or 

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:03.420
 so it's better to be safe than sorry 

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.369
 because without this you can not 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.250
 activate the phone today I'm going to show you 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:11.920
 for example I'm going to try to activate it 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:16.560
 here I do not know 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.560
 pica gmail.com 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:22.959
 and password a new 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.959
 a dog 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:27.120
 when they are trying to activate 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.860
 they are simply going to be denied and it is 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:33.050
 impossible to activate this time of 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:35.450
 phones if you do not have the 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:38.410
 with the correct password we can see 

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:41.180
 which is the correct 

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:43.640
 it does not matter if we restore it does not matter 

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:47.540
 nothing if you do not have the password 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:50.930
 the account is useless 

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:54.730
 I'm going to show you how it gets the same if 

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.730
 we connect it to itunes that we're going to see 

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.530
 the same will ask us for the same thing 

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:01.490
 it's useless if we do not put the data 

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:04.820
 correct phone 

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:08.290
 you will not be able to serve and well here I go 

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:08.290

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:19.310
 and placing this 

00:03:16.770 --> 00:03:19.310
 peace 

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:30.060
 in the equipment has been activated and already left 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:36.469
 using without that password the 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:38.239

00:03:36.469 --> 00:03:40.340
