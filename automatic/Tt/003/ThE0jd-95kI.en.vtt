cups<00:02:46.439> underneath<00:02:46.889> that<00:02:47.099> prevent<00:02:47.489> it<00:02:47.609> from

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:47.639 
cups underneath that prevent it from

00:02:47.639 --> 00:02:50.179

sliding<00:02:48.090> around<00:02:48.359> the<00:02:48.840> surface<00:02:49.139> although<00:02:49.980> I'm

00:02:50.179 --> 00:02:50.189 
sliding around the surface although I'm

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:51.649 
sliding around the surface although I'm
not<00:02:50.340> sure<00:02:50.400> how<00:02:50.819> well<00:02:51.060> it<00:02:51.090> would<00:02:51.299> work<00:02:51.329> on<00:02:51.629> a

00:02:51.649 --> 00:02:51.659 
not sure how well it would work on a

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:18.060 
as it was an f1 challenge that game

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:20.479 
as it was an f1 challenge that game
really<00:03:18.599> needed<00:03:18.870> the<00:03:18.989> wheel<00:03:19.170> however<00:03:20.040> the<00:03:20.250> game

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
really needed the wheel however the game

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:23.869 
really needed the wheel however the game

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:37.450 

00:03:37.450 --> 00:03:39.750 

you<00:03:38.080> need<00:03:38.379> the<00:03:38.590> wheel<00:03:38.739> to<00:03:38.920> play<00:03:39.099> this<00:03:39.250> game<00:03:39.489> the

all<00:03:52.040> the<00:03:52.189> way<00:03:52.310> it's<00:03:53.030> great<00:03:53.480> I<00:03:53.780> mean<00:03:54.230> look

00:03:54.399 --> 00:03:54.409 
all the way it's great I mean look

there's<00:03:54.560> even<00:03:54.739> a<00:03:54.920> picture<00:03:55.129> of<00:03:55.489> this<00:03:55.609> thing<00:03:55.670> in

there's even a picture of this thing in

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:58.449 
there's even a picture of this thing in
the<00:03:56.569> instruction<00:03:57.140> manual<00:03:57.280> although<00:03:58.280> I'm<00:03:58.340> not

00:03:58.449 --> 00:03:58.459 
the instruction manual although I'm not

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:05.080 
the instruction manual although I'm not
sure<00:03:58.519> what<00:03:58.819> any<00:03:59.000> of<00:03:59.150> that<00:03:59.269> stuff<00:03:59.390> says

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:05.090 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:07.479 

it<00:04:05.720> probably<00:04:06.019> says<00:04:06.530> don't<00:04:06.860> try<00:04:07.069> to<00:04:07.129> play<00:04:07.340> this

00:04:07.479 --> 00:04:07.489 
it probably says don't try to play this

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:09.430 
it probably says don't try to play this
game<00:04:07.700> without<00:04:07.849> the<00:04:08.120> Saturn<00:04:08.450> racing<00:04:08.870> wheel<00:04:09.019> and

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:09.440 
game without the Saturn racing wheel and

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:11.440 
game without the Saturn racing wheel and
that<00:04:09.560> would<00:04:09.890> be<00:04:09.980> accurate<00:04:10.160> don't<00:04:10.760> try<00:04:11.180> to<00:04:11.239> play

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:11.450 
that would be accurate don't try to play

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:12.910 
that would be accurate don't try to play
this<00:04:11.569> game<00:04:11.810> without<00:04:11.930> the<00:04:12.230> Saturn<00:04:12.560> racing

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:12.920 
this game without the Saturn racing

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.250 
this game without the Saturn racing
wheel<00:04:13.069> it's<00:04:13.550> just<00:04:13.849> not<00:04:14.000> that<00:04:14.180> much<00:04:14.360> fun<00:04:14.420> but

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:15.260 
wheel it's just not that much fun but

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:18.430 
wheel it's just not that much fun but
with<00:04:15.440> the<00:04:15.620> wheel<00:04:15.830> it<00:04:16.609> is<00:04:17.209> annoyingly<00:04:18.199> this

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:18.440 
with the wheel it is annoyingly this

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:20.349 
with the wheel it is annoyingly this
thing<00:04:18.650> doesn't<00:04:19.070> fit<00:04:19.370> onto<00:04:19.639> the<00:04:19.850> play<00:04:20.299> seat

00:04:20.349 --> 00:04:20.359 
thing doesn't fit onto the play seat

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:23.110 
thing doesn't fit onto the play seat
though<00:04:21.079> which<00:04:21.769> means<00:04:22.010> that<00:04:22.250> play<00:04:22.460> seat<00:04:22.729> is<00:04:22.910> now

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:23.120 
though which means that play seat is now

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:26.920 
though which means that play seat is now
required<00:04:23.690> to<00:04:24.050> design<00:04:24.650> a<00:04:25.130> seat<00:04:25.669> and<00:04:25.850> setup<00:04:26.630> for

required to design a seat and setup for

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:29.080 
required to design a seat and setup for
the<00:04:27.080> Saturn<00:04:27.500> racing<00:04:27.889> wheel<00:04:28.040> with<00:04:28.760> a<00:04:28.880> nicely

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:29.090 
the Saturn racing wheel with a nicely

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:32.379 
the Saturn racing wheel with a nicely
embroidered<00:04:29.810> Saturn<00:04:30.440> logo<00:04:31.250> in<00:04:31.460> the<00:04:31.880> seats<00:04:32.210> and

embroidered Saturn logo in the seats and
a<00:04:32.900> cup<00:04:33.110> holder<00:04:33.260> to<00:04:33.949> make<00:04:34.100> sure<00:04:34.280> every<00:04:34.699> game<00:04:34.910> has

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:35.150 
a cup holder to make sure every game has

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:46.379 
a cup holder to make sure every game has
the<00:04:35.180> appropriate<00:04:35.600> cocktail<00:04:36.380> view

00:04:46.379 --> 00:04:46.389 

00:04:46.389 --> 00:04:48.510 

now<00:04:47.050> I<00:04:47.080> don't<00:04:47.259> believe<00:04:47.560> this<00:04:48.069> works<00:04:48.340> with

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:48.520 
now I don't believe this works with

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.700 
now I don't believe this works with
every<00:04:48.759> Saturn<00:04:49.509> racing<00:04:49.930> game<00:04:50.139> but<00:04:50.379> it<00:04:50.500> worked

you feel like you're playing a game that

00:04:54.819 --> 00:04:57.119 
you feel like you're playing a game that

00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:58.810 
check the internet and see if it

00:04:58.810 --> 00:05:01.980 
check the internet and see if it
supports<00:04:58.930> the<00:04:59.259> wheel<00:04:59.530> if<00:05:00.520> it<00:05:00.909> does<00:05:01.150> buy<00:05:01.930> the

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:01.990

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:04.439 
supports the wheel if it does buy the
wheel<00:05:02.289> but<00:05:03.069> it<00:05:03.189> definitely<00:05:03.699> doesn't<00:05:04.000> improve

00:05:04.439 --> 00:05:04.449 
wheel but it definitely doesn't improve

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:38.930 
awesome racing games I like the wheel I

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:41.320 
awesome racing games I like the wheel I
like<00:05:39.320> that<00:05:39.470> it<00:05:39.590> doesn't<00:05:39.919> need<00:05:40.100> pedals<00:05:40.730> to<00:05:41.090> play

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:41.330 
like that it doesn't need pedals to play

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:43.030 
like that it doesn't need pedals to play
this<00:05:41.540> that's<00:05:41.840> not<00:05:42.020> always<00:05:42.200> the<00:05:42.320> ideal<00:05:42.740> setup

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:43.040 
this that's not always the ideal setup

00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:44.740 
this that's not always the ideal setup
unless<00:05:43.400> you<00:05:43.639> have<00:05:43.820> something<00:05:44.210> like<00:05:44.240> a<00:05:44.419> play

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:44.750

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:49.280 
it's not a four-speed back wheel but it

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:51.879 
it's not a four-speed back wheel but it
just<00:05:49.460> feels<00:05:49.790> right<00:05:50.150> for<00:05:50.990> driving<00:05:51.470> games<00:05:51.680> on
