00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:06.820
 this 

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:09.969
 it does not have clear express like that with 77 megawatts 

00:01:09.969 --> 00:01:13.000
 and I already have it assumed by megavatio k 

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.480
 The download is excellent and I will leave it below the description of the video 

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:20.380

 zero points 9 points and koke 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:28.160
 his competitor due stressed touch and expects the time spent loa 

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:32.050
 and you download it because of the scarlet box for the xerez the program does 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:34.280
 read next following

 and accept the terms of the contract 7 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.410
 but it seems that when I have to appear or I did not know what the basis of a 

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:44.100
 pineapple with a glass here common 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.770
 there was something like this is the guy what I bring that good we open it and let's see the 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.820
 I'm going to show you how to use it these moments 

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:53.219
 Monsignor Jorge Lozano 

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:54.900
 and how to put the tooth 

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:56.110
 the video 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:57.590
 its high cost 

00:01:57.590 --> 00:02:01.140
 we are here then we are going to do we are going to choose the video 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.930
 of corvids enters the desktop you can see the video that I have one of 

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:07.050
 those that I have not done 

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:09.649
 teacher 

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:12.019
 this too 

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:14.709
 revilla 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:20.230
 percent and late cooper this this video that in montevideo this is 

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:23.449
 here then what I'm going to do open it 

00:02:23.449 --> 00:02:26.890
 i immediately the table and the porn oak the program 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:27.989
 this program 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:30.069
 then I look for a layman that I have 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:33.169
 because here is the universal there is the arch 

00:02:33.169 --> 00:02:35.679

 in her court there are many cowboys that I only have the classic 

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:48.099
 as classic terror methods the legendary find of the court who 

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:48.739
 lives 

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:49.620
 the idea is to go 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.739
 so you say newspapers of the basic period the classic story speaks to me 

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:58.360
 here then I see it right here to the action that says enough i immediately 

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:00.479

 then this one has been territorial as backup 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:42.259
 we will have to see who does work 

00:04:42.259 --> 00:04:45.279
 then already after the reasoning what are you going to do 

00:04:45.279 --> 00:04:46.020
