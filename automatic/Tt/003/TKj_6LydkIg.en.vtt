headsets let's let's hop to it this is
the<00:00:13.340> first<00:00:13.730> set<00:00:14.390> I<00:00:14.780> bought<00:00:15.620> when<00:00:16.340> they<00:00:16.520> first

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:16.789 
the first set I bought when they first

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:20.079 
the first set I bought when they first
came<00:00:16.970> up<00:00:17.150> I<00:00:17.359> believe<00:00:17.630> was<00:00:17.810> in<00:00:17.900> October<00:00:19.089> 2012

00:00:20.079 --> 00:00:20.089 
came up I believe was in October 2012

00:00:20.089 --> 00:00:29.589 
came up I believe was in October 2012
and<00:00:24.910> the<00:00:25.910> the<00:00:26.329> pulse<00:00:26.570> the<00:00:26.929> pulse<00:00:27.560> engines<00:00:28.599> they

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:29.599 
and the the pulse the pulse engines they

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:31.810 
and the the pulse the pulse engines they
still<00:00:29.900> work<00:00:30.140> and<00:00:30.349> all<00:00:30.499> but<00:00:31.400> my<00:00:31.550> biggest

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:31.820 
still work and all but my biggest

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.510 
still work and all but my biggest
problem<00:00:32.390> is<00:00:32.509> the<00:00:32.540> cup<00:00:32.930> itself<00:00:33.770> is<00:00:34.040> just<00:00:34.250> kind

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:34.520 
problem is the cup itself is just kind

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:39.250 
problem is the cup itself is just kind
of<00:00:34.580> hanging<00:00:34.880> on<00:00:35.240> there<00:00:37.240> what<00:00:38.240> happened<00:00:38.600> was<00:00:38.750> I

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:39.260 
of hanging on there what happened was I

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:43.410 
of hanging on there what happened was I
started<00:00:39.890> noticing<00:00:40.270> cracks<00:00:41.270> between<00:00:41.990> the

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:43.420 
started noticing cracks between the

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:49.900 
started noticing cracks between the
pulse<00:00:44.860> engine<00:00:45.860> and<00:00:46.070> the<00:00:47.680> cup<00:00:48.680> holder<00:00:49.220> like

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:49.910 
pulse engine and the cup holder like

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:51.610 
pulse engine and the cup holder like
tiny<00:00:50.210> cracks<00:00:50.600> and<00:00:50.840> then<00:00:50.960> eventually<00:00:51.260> I<00:00:51.500> was

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:51.620 
tiny cracks and then eventually I was

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:53.650 
tiny cracks and then eventually I was
playing<00:00:51.860> so<00:00:52.070> come<00:00:52.310> one<00:00:52.490> day<00:00:52.700> and<00:00:53.000> it<00:00:53.270> just<00:00:53.480> kind

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:53.660 
playing so come one day and it just kind

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.340 
playing so come one day and it just kind
of<00:00:53.720> fell<00:00:54.080> off<00:00:54.110> I<00:00:54.790> kid<00:00:55.790> you<00:00:55.820> not<00:00:56.000> man<00:00:56.150> II<00:00:56.360> the

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.350 
of fell off I kid you not man II the

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:00.190 
of fell off I kid you not man II the
head<00:00:57.560> the<00:00:58.550> cup<00:00:58.880> just<00:00:58.910> just<00:00:59.540> fell<00:00:59.930> right<00:00:59.960> off

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:00.200 
head the cup just just fell right off

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.440 
head the cup just just fell right off
and<00:01:00.770> you<00:01:00.890> can<00:01:01.040> see<00:01:01.190> that<00:01:01.400> cracks<00:01:01.850> on<00:01:02.090> this<00:01:02.270> one

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:02.450 
and you can see that cracks on this one

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:06.029 
and you can see that cracks on this one
as<00:01:02.600> well<00:01:02.750> and<00:01:03.530> I<00:01:03.590> tried<00:01:03.860> to<00:01:04.009> crazy<00:01:04.280> glue<00:01:04.579> them

00:01:06.029 --> 00:01:06.039 
as well and I tried to crazy glue them

00:01:06.039 --> 00:01:13.109 
as well and I tried to crazy glue them
but<00:01:07.039> crazy<00:01:07.759> glue<00:01:07.969> doesn't<00:01:08.210> really<00:01:08.450> help<00:01:11.859> so

00:01:13.109 --> 00:01:13.119 
but crazy glue doesn't really help so

00:01:13.119 --> 00:01:16.300 
but crazy glue doesn't really help so
your<00:01:14.119> best<00:01:14.390> bet<00:01:14.539> is<00:01:14.689> to<00:01:14.990> just<00:01:15.049> not<00:01:15.499> bar<00:01:16.069> these

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:16.310 
your best bet is to just not bar these

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.749 
your best bet is to just not bar these
things<00:01:16.640> so<00:01:17.600> thinking<00:01:18.079> that<00:01:18.530> I<00:01:18.590> was<00:01:19.100> using<00:01:19.549> the

00:01:19.749 --> 00:01:19.759 
things so thinking that I was using the

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:21.580 
things so thinking that I was using the
mountain<00:01:20.030> to<00:01:20.119> cold<00:01:20.390> in<00:01:20.509> that<00:01:20.569> it<00:01:20.810> was<00:01:20.899> my<00:01:21.079> fault

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 
mountain to cold in that it was my fault

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.370 
mountain to cold in that it was my fault
I<00:01:21.619> figured<00:01:22.609> okay<00:01:23.060> while<00:01:23.240> a<00:01:23.270> baby<00:01:23.600> the<00:01:24.079> next

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:24.380 
I figured okay while a baby the next

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.800 
I figured okay while a baby the next
pair<00:01:24.710> I<00:01:24.740> buy<00:01:25.119> which<00:01:26.119> we're<00:01:26.270> gonna<00:01:26.329> get<00:01:26.539> to<00:01:26.719> in

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:26.810 
pair I buy which we're gonna get to in

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:28.719 
pair I buy which we're gonna get to in
just<00:01:26.929> a<00:01:27.079> second<00:01:27.469> I<00:01:27.590> thought<00:01:28.100> it<00:01:28.280> was<00:01:28.369> the<00:01:28.460> cold

00:01:28.719 --> 00:01:28.729 
just a second I thought it was the cold

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:31.389 
just a second I thought it was the cold
that<00:01:28.909> had<00:01:29.090> done<00:01:29.329> them<00:01:29.539> in<00:01:29.920> but<00:01:30.920> apparently

00:01:31.389 --> 00:01:31.399 
that had done them in but apparently

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:35.169 
that had done them in but apparently
after<00:01:32.030> a<00:01:32.210> little<00:01:32.479> more<00:01:32.600> research<00:01:33.549> what<00:01:34.549> what

00:01:35.169 --> 00:01:35.179 
after a little more research what what

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:37.690 
after a little more research what what
the<00:01:35.299> real<00:01:35.479> problem<00:01:35.929> is<00:01:36.049> is<00:01:36.350> a<00:01:36.380> huge<00:01:37.189> design

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:37.700 
the real problem is is a huge design

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.929 
the real problem is is a huge design
flaw<00:01:38.079> though<00:01:39.079> like<00:01:39.979> these<00:01:40.189> are<00:01:40.369> metal<00:01:40.759> and

00:01:40.929 --> 00:01:40.939 
flaw though like these are metal and

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:42.999 
flaw though like these are metal and
that's<00:01:41.299> like<00:01:41.539> just<00:01:41.780> like<00:01:41.899> plastic<00:01:42.530> it's<00:01:42.770> very

00:01:42.999 --> 00:01:43.009 
that's like just like plastic it's very

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:48.459 
that's like just like plastic it's very
brittle<00:01:43.549> right<00:01:44.270> from<00:01:44.539> the<00:01:44.659> get-go<00:01:44.899> so<00:01:47.259> you<00:01:48.259> can

00:01:48.459 --> 00:01:48.469 
brittle right from the get-go so you can

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:50.770 
brittle right from the get-go so you can
see<00:01:48.649> that<00:01:48.829> this<00:01:49.009> side<00:01:49.310> here<00:01:49.639> is<00:01:50.179> holding<00:01:50.659> up

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780 
see that this side here is holding up

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.770 
see that this side here is holding up
pretty<00:01:50.990> well<00:01:51.139> and<00:01:51.560> I<00:01:52.100> bought<00:01:52.340> I<00:01:53.030> bought<00:01:53.270> this

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:53.780 
pretty well and I bought I bought this

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.730 
pretty well and I bought I bought this
pair<00:01:54.049> like<00:01:54.259> two<00:01:54.499> months<00:01:54.709> after<00:01:55.310> the<00:01:56.030> first<00:01:56.329> one

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:56.740 
pair like two months after the first one

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:03.160 
pair like two months after the first one
cracked<00:01:57.740> right<00:01:57.950> off<00:02:01.240> the<00:02:02.240> pulse<00:02:02.509> engine<00:02:02.899> still

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170 
cracked right off the pulse engine still

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:08.550 
cracked right off the pulse engine still
worked<00:02:03.409> really<00:02:03.590> good<00:02:04.779> but<00:02:05.779> on<00:02:06.109> this<00:02:06.409> side

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:08.560 
worked really good but on this side

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.550 
worked really good but on this side
that's<00:02:09.560> it<00:02:09.920> that's<00:02:10.250> what<00:02:10.489> it<00:02:10.610> looks<00:02:10.819> like<00:02:10.970> now

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.780 

you<00:02:14.560> see<00:02:14.769> it<00:02:14.920> started<00:02:15.250> off<00:02:15.340> with<00:02:15.519> little

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
you see it started off with little

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.520 
you see it started off with little
cracks<00:02:16.090> and<00:02:16.390> then<00:02:16.510> it<00:02:16.750> just<00:02:16.930> eventually<00:02:17.409> just

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530 
cracks and then it just eventually just

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:22.080 
cracks and then it just eventually just
started<00:02:17.920> to<00:02:18.069> like<00:02:19.590> crack<00:02:20.590> really<00:02:20.859> bad<00:02:21.159> and<00:02:21.640> now

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:22.090 
started to like crack really bad and now

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:26.449 
started to like crack really bad and now
let<00:02:22.239> me<00:02:22.329> show<00:02:22.540> you<00:02:22.659> from<00:02:22.900> this<00:02:23.140> angle<00:02:24.420> what<00:02:25.420> the

00:02:26.449 --> 00:02:26.459 
let me show you from this angle what the

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:28.949 
let me show you from this angle what the
pulse<00:02:27.459> engine<00:02:27.909> looks<00:02:28.120> like<00:02:28.329> like<00:02:28.510> I<00:02:28.750> could

00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:28.959 
pulse engine looks like like I could

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:30.569 
pulse engine looks like like I could
snap<00:02:29.319> this<00:02:29.530> right<00:02:29.799> off<00:02:30.010> right<00:02:30.219> now<00:02:30.370> if<00:02:30.519> I

00:02:30.569 --> 00:02:30.579 
snap this right off right now if I

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:35.339 
snap this right off right now if I
really<00:02:30.849> wanted<00:02:31.180> to<00:02:33.900> and<00:02:34.900> that's<00:02:35.049> what<00:02:35.260> it

00:02:35.339 --> 00:02:35.349
