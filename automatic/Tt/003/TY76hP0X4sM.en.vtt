to bring a lot of closure outfit and I

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:29.339 
to bring a lot of closure outfit and I
thought<00:06:26.319> that<00:06:26.860> putting<00:06:27.840> those<00:06:28.840> colors<00:06:29.229> and

00:06:29.339 --> 00:06:29.349 
thought that putting those colors and

00:06:29.349 --> 00:06:31.860 
thought that putting those colors and
the<00:06:29.409> leaves<00:06:29.620> would<00:06:29.830> be<00:06:29.949> really<00:06:30.189> cool<00:06:30.719> going<00:06:31.719> to

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:31.870 
the leaves would be really cool going to

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:34.520 
the leaves would be really cool going to
make<00:06:32.020> this<00:06:32.289> bed<00:06:32.590> bright<00:06:33.039> and<00:06:33.310> colorful

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:34.530 
make this bed bright and colorful

00:06:34.530 --> 00:06:36.869 
make this bed bright and colorful
because<00:06:35.530> it's<00:06:35.949> not<00:06:36.099> the<00:06:36.250> easiest<00:06:36.610> thing<00:06:36.849> to

00:06:36.869 --> 00:06:36.879 
because it's not the easiest thing to

00:06:36.879 --> 00:06:38.640 
because it's not the easiest thing to
make<00:06:37.180> a<00:06:37.210> bunch<00:06:37.479> of<00:06:37.569> Brown<00:06:37.810> very<00:06:38.050> colorful<00:06:38.620> but
