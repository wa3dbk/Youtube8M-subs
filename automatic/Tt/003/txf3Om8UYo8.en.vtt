but<00:01:41.130> what<00:01:41.250> we're<00:01:41.369> trying<00:01:41.490> to<00:01:41.640> do<00:01:41.880> with<00:01:42.390> Zuka<00:01:42.810> is

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
but what we're trying to do with Zuka is

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.179 
but what we're trying to do with Zuka is
give<00:01:43.500> you<00:01:43.619> a<00:01:43.649> more<00:01:43.860> three-dimensional

00:01:44.179 --> 00:01:44.189 
give you a more three-dimensional

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:46.999 
give you a more three-dimensional
experience<00:01:45.090> a<00:01:45.270> wide<00:01:45.509> sound<00:01:45.840> field<00:01:46.170> as<00:01:46.590> much<00:01:46.860> of

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
experience a wide sound field as much of

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.679 
experience a wide sound field as much of
the<00:01:47.100> bandwidth<00:01:47.549> and<00:01:47.700> loudness<00:01:47.909> as<00:01:48.240> possible

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
the bandwidth and loudness as possible

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.630 
the bandwidth and loudness as possible
so<00:01:48.780> that<00:01:48.930> you<00:01:48.990> can<00:01:49.140> experience<00:01:49.530> movies<00:01:50.399> or
