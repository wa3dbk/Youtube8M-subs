things<00:00:43.829> that<00:00:44.040> bought<00:00:44.430> groennfell<00:00:44.670> told<00:00:45.120> me

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
things that bought groennfell told me

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.260 
things that bought groennfell told me
was<00:00:45.629> that<00:00:45.809> when<00:00:46.020> he<00:00:46.260> designed<00:00:47.100> this<00:00:47.489> movement

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:48.270 
was that when he designed this movement

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:49.850 
was that when he designed this movement
he<00:00:48.420> wanted<00:00:48.719> it<00:00:48.840> to<00:00:48.870> have<00:00:49.200> a<00:00:49.410> very<00:00:49.800> very

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
he wanted it to have a very very

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.950 
he wanted it to have a very very
different<00:00:50.219> aesthetic<00:00:50.940> feel<00:00:51.210> and<00:00:51.539> you<00:00:51.809> can

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
different aesthetic feel and you can

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.529 
different aesthetic feel and you can
tell<00:00:52.230> by<00:00:52.710> the<00:00:52.770> number<00:00:53.280> of<00:00:53.520> bridges<00:00:53.730> that<00:00:54.420> it

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
tell by the number of bridges that it

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:57.229 
tell by the number of bridges that it
has<00:00:54.800> one<00:00:55.800> of<00:00:55.890> the<00:00:55.949> things<00:00:56.160> about<00:00:56.309> having<00:00:56.969> so

00:00:57.229 --> 00:00:57.239 
has one of the things about having so

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.310 
has one of the things about having so
many<00:00:57.420> bridges<00:00:57.750> is<00:00:58.170> that<00:00:58.739> the<00:00:59.039> finishing<00:00:59.879> and

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:00.320 
many bridges is that the finishing and

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.219 
many bridges is that the finishing and
the<00:01:01.760> decoration<00:01:02.760> of<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.329> movement<00:01:03.780> takes

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
the decoration of the movement takes

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.830 
the decoration of the movement takes
much<00:01:04.799> much<00:01:05.070> longer<00:01:05.339> than<00:01:05.790> something<00:01:06.479> let's

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
much much longer than something let's

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.240 
much much longer than something let's
say<00:01:07.049> with<00:01:07.290> a<00:01:07.729> standard<00:01:08.729> 3/4<00:01:09.420> plate<00:01:10.260> movement

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:11.250 
say with a standard 3/4 plate movement

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.429 
say with a standard 3/4 plate movement
so<00:01:12.060> let's<00:01:12.240> move<00:01:12.360> back<00:01:12.570> to<00:01:12.689> the<00:01:12.780> front<00:01:13.049> of<00:01:13.290> the

00:01:13.429 --> 00:01:13.439 
so let's move back to the front of the

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:16.460 
so let's move back to the front of the
watch<00:01:13.650> we<00:01:14.580> find<00:01:14.880> that<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.780> most<00:01:16.140> interesting

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
watch we find that the most interesting

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.859 
watch we find that the most interesting
thing<00:01:16.770> about<00:01:17.220> this<00:01:17.640> watch<00:01:17.880> the<00:01:18.119> one<00:01:18.299> Hertz<00:01:18.540> is

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
thing about this watch the one Hertz is

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.950 
thing about this watch the one Hertz is
because<00:01:19.500> of<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:20.250> deadbeat<00:01:20.759> seconds<00:01:21.240> right

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:21.960 
because of the deadbeat seconds right

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.539 
because of the deadbeat seconds right
here<00:01:22.020> but<00:01:22.860> I<00:01:22.890> want<00:01:23.100> to<00:01:23.189> draw<00:01:23.280> your<00:01:23.490> attention

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
here but I want to draw your attention

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:28.580 
here but I want to draw your attention
to<00:01:24.150> something<00:01:24.450> else<00:01:24.689> which<00:01:24.990> is<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.439> crown<00:01:27.590> now

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
to something else which is the crown now

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.800 
to something else which is the crown now
this<00:01:28.770> crown<00:01:29.070> is<00:01:29.430> very<00:01:29.880> unique<00:01:30.270> and<00:01:30.509> one<00:01:30.600> of<00:01:30.720> the

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
this crown is very unique and one of the

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.020 
this crown is very unique and one of the
reasons<00:01:31.170> why<00:01:31.380> it's<00:01:31.619> so<00:01:31.799> unique<00:01:32.159> is<00:01:32.640> because

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
reasons why it's so unique is because

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:35.899 
reasons why it's so unique is because
instead<00:01:33.479> of<00:01:33.750> pulling<00:01:34.680> out<00:01:35.040> the<00:01:35.250> crown<00:01:35.490> to<00:01:35.700> set

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
instead of pulling out the crown to set

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:38.960 
instead of pulling out the crown to set
the<00:01:36.030> time<00:01:36.299> what<00:01:36.869> you<00:01:36.990> do<00:01:37.229> is<00:01:37.500> you<00:01:38.280> press<00:01:38.820> the

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:38.970 
the time what you do is you press the

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:42.069 
the time what you do is you press the
crown<00:01:39.180> so<00:01:39.509> right<00:01:39.810> now<00:01:40.020> the<00:01:40.710> watch<00:01:41.310> is<00:01:41.640> in

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:42.079 
crown so right now the watch is in

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:44.990 
crown so right now the watch is in
timekeeping<00:01:43.079> mode<00:01:43.140> that<00:01:43.649> seconds<00:01:44.460> is<00:01:44.579> running

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
timekeeping mode that seconds is running

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.109 
timekeeping mode that seconds is running
if<00:01:45.299> we<00:01:45.960> were<00:01:46.110> to<00:01:46.290> look<00:01:46.439> here<00:01:46.920> we<00:01:47.520> find<00:01:47.850> that

00:01:48.109 --> 00:01:48.119 
if we were to look here we find that

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:51.170 
if we were to look here we find that
this<00:01:48.829> indicator<00:01:49.829> is<00:01:50.159> now<00:01:50.490> pointing<00:01:51.030> at

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
this indicator is now pointing at

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.569 
this indicator is now pointing at
w-which<00:01:51.780> means<00:01:51.990> winding<00:01:52.649> and<00:01:52.799> there's

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579 
w-which means winding and there's

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.240 
w-which means winding and there's
another<00:01:53.909> indicator<00:01:54.420> here<00:01:54.750> which<00:01:54.899> is<00:01:55.049> s<00:01:55.320> so<00:01:55.950> in

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.250 
another indicator here which is s so in

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.420 
another indicator here which is s so in
this<00:01:57.240> mode<00:01:57.509> the<00:01:58.229> watch<00:01:58.439> is<00:01:58.950> wound<00:01:59.420> this<00:02:00.420> way

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979 
okay so now I set the time and let's see

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.039 
okay so now I set the time and let's see
you<00:02:05.399> have<00:02:05.579> a<00:02:05.610> look<00:02:05.820> right<00:02:06.299> here<00:02:06.659> I'm<00:02:06.869> gonna

and<00:04:27.010> the<00:04:28.010> thing<00:04:28.190> is<00:04:28.310> that<00:04:28.340> the<00:04:28.850> date<00:04:29.060> beats

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:29.380 
and the thing is that the date beats

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:31.270 
and the thing is that the date beats
complication<00:04:30.380> is<00:04:30.470> not<00:04:30.620> something<00:04:30.950> that<00:04:30.980> you

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:31.280 
complication is not something that you

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.850 
complication is not something that you
see<00:04:31.700> a<00:04:31.730> lot<00:04:31.970> in<00:04:32.030> mechanical<00:04:32.630> watches<00:04:32.840> and<00:04:33.500> it's

00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:33.860 
see a lot in mechanical watches and it's

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:34.870 
see a lot in mechanical watches and it's
something<00:04:34.130> that's<00:04:34.310> been<00:04:34.460> making<00:04:34.640> a

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880 
something that's been making a

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:36.760 
something that's been making a
resurgence<00:04:35.420> recently<00:04:35.930> some<00:04:36.080> of<00:04:36.110> the<00:04:36.530> watch

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:36.770 
resurgence recently some of the watch

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:38.080 
resurgence recently some of the watch
companies<00:04:37.160> out<00:04:37.280> there<00:04:37.460> have<00:04:37.580> been<00:04:37.700> doing<00:04:37.970> this

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:38.090 
companies out there have been doing this

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:40.360 
companies out there have been doing this
but<00:04:38.780> grönefeld<00:04:39.140> I<00:04:39.470> feel<00:04:39.740> has<00:04:39.950> actually

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:40.370 
but grönefeld I feel has actually

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:43.420 
but grönefeld I feel has actually
captured<00:04:41.330> the<00:04:41.510> whole<00:04:42.170> spirit<00:04:42.710> of<00:04:42.830> the<00:04:42.950> one<00:04:43.160> of

00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:43.430
