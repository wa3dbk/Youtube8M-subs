00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:16.740
 and good of the two days two days was 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.740
 fellow great company a kid player 

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.740
 capered 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:26.850
 play of 10 

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:30.510
 and little angel today had a partner a 

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:33.230
 number nine that was soda play duo 

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:36.550
 with soda soda and hair ideas 

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:39.280
 and little angel put it on 9 because he said 

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:41.420
 you will be able to play is not going to be good no 

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.910
 are you going to play it 

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:47.050
 and the peeling better player than technical 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.050
 best player technician 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.079
 it's not like I'm going to mix two things 

00:00:49.489 --> 00:00:54.949
 what not 

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:56.899
 as a technician he has to wait to see 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:01:00.020
 what the player's players do 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:02.960
 defined of asia is the things 

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:07.430
 but it does not catch me every tantrum that in the 

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:09.770
 court because a cold guy 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:12.980
 and I remember a game that against 

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:15.410
 platense he threw the black one side 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:19.760
 on the jj I on the other and missed goals 

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:21.740
 the peeled and a moment insulted him and 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:25.010
 it grabbed my stomach so insulting one 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:28.510
 and he knows that he laughs and wakes me up 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.510
 and I say 

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:33.219
 what happens how ends match equal of 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:36.479
 pelado díaz at 45 the second time 

00:01:33.219 --> 00:01:36.479
 And we decided 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:46.610
 but a player of tito has been deployed 

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:49.549
 maybe he does not know the story I lived 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:54.049
 in the powder magazines like that would also be 

00:01:49.549 --> 00:01:57.380
 a great big pure kiss and he lived in a 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:02:00.320
 home like we are suddenly not 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:03.380
 I had floor had a bar floor and I talked to 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:07.250
 patrick was not the leader added 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:09.229
 and I told him to go see the way that 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:12.940
 I was living that boy who is a 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.940
 player who was going to give him many joys 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:17.829
 and you can take it out 

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.829
 there are not 2 left 

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.520
 unfair you mentioned the chori 

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.590
 dominguez and cavenaghi 

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:29.590
 and two types of 

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.590
 above 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:37.439
 but hey, they gave him stuff that 

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:39.569
 it moved the attitude when high that 

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:43.290
 descended ribéry was the so-called 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:45.599
 we go there and all this gesture 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.620
 my gesture makes me happy 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:50.080
 good ones 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.849
 does it mean they want institution me 

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:53.410
 fit here I had no doubt because 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:55.600
 the one born in the club 

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:58.920
 in fact good is a gesture that 

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.920
 better is a friend talks a lot 

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:05.190
 very good because the gesture is that no 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:07.980
 they came at age 35 

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:11.340
 in a heyday with laburo in europe's 

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.950
 earn more is very good they did the 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.550
 true 

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:15.550
 to mark 

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:21.440
 I hate the way you can 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:24.070
 I told you again and again if yes 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.070
 latest 

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:31.030
 tells me 

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:33.670
 more than diego 

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:36.840
 to compare is one that we are 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:36.840
 wrong if we compare 

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:43.810
 two different times in two stages in 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:43.810
 life different 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.819
 two different players 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:52.060
 you have to enjoy it and the two Argentines 

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:54.520
 the two Argentines pride 

00:03:52.060 --> 00:04:01.020
 They are two Argentines you have to enjoy it 

00:03:54.520 --> 00:04:01.020
 surprised again and no wonder 

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:06.080
 for us the forwards of that 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:09.890
 placed although it does not have a position 

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:12.260
 promptly like the one I had 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:16.100
 he is a player that unbalances you is a 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:19.299
 player that suddenly is very difficult to 

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:23.229
 for opposites find it 

00:04:19.299 --> 00:04:26.139
 and he plays you at a speed and he plays you 

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:29.800
 with this game and know askance 

00:04:26.139 --> 00:04:33.220
 suddenly where are the marquitos and if the 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:34.600
 is going to pull throw to that angle that 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:36.880
 angle 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:40.570
 already has his eyes on the ball 

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:42.560
 because it 's very fucking prattling not 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:44.830
 looking at the ball 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:47.870
 and this environment when the 

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:52.270
 withdrawal to the foot with your foot 

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:52.270
 left and the machine guns
