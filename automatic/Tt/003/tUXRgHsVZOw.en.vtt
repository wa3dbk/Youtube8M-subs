00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:12.680 

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.619

00:03:14.619 --> 00:03:14.629 
we're putting ointment on their feet we

00:03:14.629 --> 00:03:16.360 
we're putting ointment on their feet we
do<00:03:14.750> that<00:03:14.930> before<00:03:15.049> every<00:03:15.439> race<00:03:15.620> just<00:03:15.980> to<00:03:16.099> kind

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:16.370 
do that before every race just to kind

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:23.880

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:23.890 

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:26.649 

think<00:03:24.890> the<00:03:25.040> trail<00:03:25.430> would<00:03:26.209> the<00:03:26.329> windblown

00:03:26.649 --> 00:03:26.659 
think the trail would the windblown

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:28.179 
think the trail would the windblown
trail<00:03:27.109> might<00:03:27.319> be<00:03:27.469> a<00:03:27.500> little<00:03:27.709> bit<00:03:27.859> hard<00:03:28.069> on

trail might be a little bit hard on
their<00:03:28.370> feet<00:03:29.079> especially<00:03:30.079> if<00:03:30.319> it's<00:03:30.439> not<00:03:30.620> drying

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.010 
their feet especially if it's not drying

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:34.750 
their feet especially if it's not drying
cold<00:03:32.739> will<00:03:33.739> be<00:03:33.829> hard<00:03:34.040> it'll<00:03:34.370> be<00:03:34.459> heard<00:03:34.609> of<00:03:34.700> my
