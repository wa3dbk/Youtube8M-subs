00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.240
 Welcome to god morning 

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:05.970
 daily view on godmodetrader daily 

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.350
 live at 8 the recent crash of 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.210
 raw material prices my ladies and gentlemen 

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:11.639
 reminds barclays capital of one 

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:13.830
 Similar correction that we have before 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:16.619
 about a year had followed at that time 

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:18.660
 on this correction of the raw materials one 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:21.900
 noticeable growth slowdown 

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:23.279
 emerging countries and that could too 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.260
 This time the case will be even though 

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.150
 this time in front because that does not offer 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.539
 As demand at that time blamed on 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.399
 price decline is 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:34.440
 Nevertheless, according to Barclays Capital 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.880
 the situation in the right watch 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.600
 not possible developments here 

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:39.329
 miss 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.190
 what does the crash in the oil copper and 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:44.700
 gold for the global economy there are yes 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:47.850
 many are looking for the foundations of my 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:51.059
 View in my opinion can 

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:53.100
 one responds to these developments 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:54.949
 in the cycles of the us dollar find the 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.329
 US dollar is the world's reserve currency 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:59.670
 even though he criticizes a lot 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.260
 was due to the stability of the dollar 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:04.409
 he continues the world reserve currency and 

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.600
 as such he ultimately determines the 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.210
 movements from the us dollar almost determine 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.369
 Any price worldwide just about this 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.320
 world tears over this in this reserve 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.049
 status and we live since then 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.470
 several years to be exact since 

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:20.520
 seven years in a regime of one 

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:22.320
 higher than bullish 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.220
 increasing or appreciating 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:28.290
 us dollars and there are the former 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:30.090
 stars of the world economy so the brics 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.619
 States or the 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.689
 commodity producers 

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:35.430
 they are becoming the hot spots of the world 

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:37.920
 while the industrialized countries one 

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:40.350
 recovery experienced because the us dollar 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:42.439
 liquidity from the world market as he of the 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.790
 emerging markets for example 

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:47.369
 is attributed to the core area of ​​the 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:48.149
 currency system so here mainly in 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.100
 the USA 

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:52.500
 There it leads to rising 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:54.710
 Investment and interest rates are rising 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.860
 because the markets are picking up 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.799
 anticipate 

00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:00.390
 this increases the cost of the dollar loans 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.670
 emerging countries so the rising 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.520
 interest rates and commodity producers 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.799
 then you have to save even more 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.550
 what the demand for raw materials continues 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:11.009
 sink 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.990
 and so on and so on in one 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.490
 such environment is recommended 

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:16.110
 I have that for the first time before two and a half 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:18.750
 said years ago because I turn this in 

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:20.760
 plant cycle anticipated this 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.340
 it is recommended to be portfolio 

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.900
 accordingly to change stocks in the dax 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:26.820
 and at wall street should be at 

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:28.950
 corrections are purchased 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:31.200
 i think that's more on wall street 

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.940
 have not seen any correction yet 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.690
 in the dax it could be a bit 

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:38.790
 go deeper, however, with corrections 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.100
 one should share in this environment in 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:42.920
 which we are and buy 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:45.090
 Raw materials should be added 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:47.400
 repel recovery movements and 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.890
 This is especially true for the sale 

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:52.440
 gold there are still many the one 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:55.170
 Expect early ground in the gold price 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:57.300
 I see that differently gold is the highest 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.650
 Cyclically, of course, the price can be 

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.390
 to recover 

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:02.130
 that was it, too 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:03.960
 In general, gold will not be that way anymore 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:06.000
 quickly grab those who are here 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:08.040
 very bad the fingers burned and the 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
 goldbugs alone will not be gold 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.660
 can move 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.880
 the last high in the gold was in january 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:17.460
 1980 the low point was not four years 

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:20.420
 later found but it took 20 

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:22.560
 years until the low point of the gold 

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:24.960
 the gold of the 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:28.080
 escapades of that time had recovered and 

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:29.700
 was again superordinate so cleaned up was like that 

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:31.440
 that it will go again a new pants 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.040
 why could it be different this time ? 

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:35.760
 his 

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:37.260
 in my opinion, we are or 

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:39.120
 we are in the reverse process 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:41.840
 the much-vaunted supercycle of 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:45.120
 Raw materials how was the situation between 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:47.280
 1995 to 2001 as the us dollar the 

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.230
 last time the parent enhances 

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.670
 the new market gave rise to share prices 

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:53.460
 went through the ceiling of the economy 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:54.990
 I was really good at running and that 

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:57.000
 now seems to be synonymous in the us 

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:59.490
 The car sales will work for July 

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.560
 have exceeded all expectations 

00:03:59.490 --> 00:04:04.440
 straight german car makers are doing here 

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:07.440
 really good deals with porsche + 10% 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:10.920
 vw audi all through the bank doing here 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:12.680
 really good deals for europe as 

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:14.700
 as economics as 

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:16.709
 You can not do that economically 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:18.750
 really say obviously 

00:04:16.709 --> 00:04:20.790
 the way the negotiations 

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:23.080
 Damage was caused to Greece 

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:25.030
 generated in the confidence of abroad 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:27.460
 the impulse the credits rating agency 

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:29.949
 yesterday lowered his thumb over the eu 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:32.500
 and now has a negative outlook 

00:04:29.949 --> 00:04:34.509
 for future credit checks because you 

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:36.849
 assumes that the EU is the last 

00:04:34.509 --> 00:04:39.159
 be a financial or public body 

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:40.659
 and that will always be the balance of the EU 

00:04:39.159 --> 00:04:43.990
 heavier load 

00:04:40.659 --> 00:04:46.060
 a top rating for creditworthiness will be there 

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:46.930
 Such an environment sometime not 

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:50.080
 more appropriate 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:52.270
 For a few weeks , the dax falls through 

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:55.000
 a worse development relative to 

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:58.180
 other world indices on that is probably 

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.280
 also because the cdu and csu are firmer 

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:01.900
 sitting in the saddle than ever before 

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:04.870
 the fact but then that is 

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:06.789
 Even sales foreseeable that just this 

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:08.770
 The austerity policy will continue 

00:05:06.789 --> 00:05:11.110
 Markets did not taste at all 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:15.000
 the summer interview of csu-chef horst 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:18.849
 Seehofer said the current polls 

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:22.750
 prove that cdu / csu here the absolute 

00:05:18.849 --> 00:05:25.419
 majority have become so as I said 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:27.909
 At least the austerity measures 40 appear 

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:30.279
 that the markets as seen on soon 

00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:34.060
 do not change in that respect great 

00:05:30.279 --> 00:05:37.569
 Growth spurt in the EU respectively 

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:39.089
 eurozone is not really foreseeable that 

00:05:37.569 --> 00:05:42.009
 now leads to the fact that the 

00:05:39.089 --> 00:05:44.620
 Production costs for freight from Asia 

00:05:42.009 --> 00:05:48.490
 to northern europe by sea 

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:51.430
 Weekly drop by 22 8 are the 

00:05:48.490 --> 00:05:53.949
 Very good from Asia to Europe is the 

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:56.020
 most used worldwide 1 6 meters long 

00:05:53.949 --> 00:05:57.370
 standard container costs for 

00:05:56.020 --> 00:06:00.099
 Shipping companies usually 

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:01.750
 between 800 and 1000 dollars so with 

00:06:00.099 --> 00:06:04.719
 They have their 800 to 1000 dollars 

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:07.349
 cost just laid now lies 

00:06:04.719 --> 00:06:09.969
 the price is only 400 dollars 

00:06:07.349 --> 00:06:12.430
 there was a village where I live 

00:06:09.969 --> 00:06:14.860
 I grew up with a hen egg 14 

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:17.379
 bought cent and sold them for 5 cents 

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:19.139
 when you asked him why he did that 

00:06:17.379 --> 00:06:21.879
 because he said the mass brings 

00:06:19.139 --> 00:06:23.830
 So this development in the 

00:06:21.879 --> 00:06:25.180
 Freight rates in my view 

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:26.830
 do not take a good end 

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:28.629
 just as little as on the commodities market 

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:31.270
 even there will be times 

00:06:28.629 --> 00:06:32.709
 At the moment there are still many companies 

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:33.009
 it's a bit of a merger 

00:06:32.709 --> 00:06:36.639
 crazy 

00:06:33.009 --> 00:06:38.319
 action on this crisis the central bank 

00:06:36.639 --> 00:06:39.930
 demanded , all supplied only with 

00:06:38.319 --> 00:06:43.289
 relatively cheap money though 

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:45.550
 In the medium term, there will also be some big ones 

00:06:43.289 --> 00:06:48.159
 Companies get caught when the prices are up 

00:06:45.550 --> 00:06:50.319
 not recover and on it 

00:06:48.159 --> 00:06:51.969
 There is currently little indication 

00:06:50.319 --> 00:06:53.409
 that 's it for me again 

00:06:51.969 --> 00:06:56.409
 today they will turn back tomorrow 

00:06:53.409 --> 00:06:58.240
 a live 8 on the godmodetrader at 9.00 

00:06:56.409 --> 00:06:59.169
 clock is then always the retrievable video 

00:06:58.240 --> 00:07:00.699
 available 

00:06:59.169 --> 00:07:02.020
 the links to all that via youtube 

00:07:00.699 --> 00:07:03.490
 you can find it in the 

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:04.809
 description if you like then
