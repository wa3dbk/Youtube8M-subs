00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:53.580 
check this video out right here we were

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:54.770 
check this video out right here we were
coming<00:01:53.850> back<00:01:53.880> we<00:01:54.180> were<00:01:54.240> using<00:01:54.479> a<00:01:54.510> shuttle

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780 
coming back we were using a shuttle

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.550 
coming back we were using a shuttle
service<00:01:54.990> we<00:01:55.530> got<00:01:55.770> lucky<00:01:56.600> we<00:01:57.600> made<00:01:57.840> it<00:01:57.960> past

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560 
service we got lucky we made it past

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.179 
service we got lucky we made it past
this<00:01:58.909> truck<00:01:59.909> that<00:02:00.270> had<00:02:00.420> flipped<00:02:00.659> over

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:01.189 
this truck that had flipped over

00:02:01.189 --> 00:02:03.800 
this truck that had flipped over
unfortunately<00:02:02.189> the<00:02:02.310> big<00:02:02.460> SUV<00:02:02.909> behind<00:02:03.299> us<00:02:03.479> did

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810 
unfortunately the big SUV behind us did

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.660 
unfortunately the big SUV behind us did
not<00:02:03.840> make<00:02:04.259> it<00:02:04.290> pass<00:02:04.650> and<00:02:05.040> he<00:02:05.340> ended<00:02:05.520> up

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
not make it pass and he ended up

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.730 
not make it pass and he ended up
clogging<00:02:06.150> traffic<00:02:06.720> but<00:02:06.869> all<00:02:06.990> behind<00:02:07.259> him<00:02:07.560> and

00:02:07.730 --> 00:02:07.740 
clogging traffic but all behind him and

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:10.999 
clogging traffic but all behind him and
nobody<00:02:08.280> could<00:02:08.509> you<00:02:09.509> can<00:02:09.689> literally<00:02:09.989> lose<00:02:10.289> ours

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
nobody could you can literally lose ours

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.280 
nobody could you can literally lose ours
so<00:02:11.730> yeah<00:02:12.269> I<00:02:12.720> think<00:02:12.780> that<00:02:12.959> you've<00:02:13.110> got<00:02:13.200> to

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:13.290 
so yeah I think that you've got to

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:17.240 
so yeah I think that you've got to
consider<00:02:13.470> that<00:02:13.860> now<00:02:14.689> landslides<00:02:15.689> and<00:02:16.250> bridges

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
consider that now landslides and bridges

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.030 
consider that now landslides and bridges
being<00:02:17.459> out<00:02:17.730> that<00:02:18.299> does<00:02:18.750> happen<00:02:19.200> that's<00:02:19.650> not<00:02:19.860> an

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040 
being out that does happen that's not an

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.100 
being out that does happen that's not an
exception<00:02:20.760> to<00:02:21.060> the<00:02:21.209> rule<00:02:21.420> it's<00:02:21.659> kind<00:02:21.900> of<00:02:21.989> the

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:22.110 
exception to the rule it's kind of the

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.380 
exception to the rule it's kind of the
exception<00:02:22.590> especially<00:02:23.239> especially<00:02:24.239> during

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
exception especially especially during

I<00:02:30.060> have<00:02:30.450> another<00:02:30.660> video<00:02:30.900> on<00:02:31.110> that<00:02:31.290> some<00:02:31.650> time

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
I have another video on that some time

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.130 
I have another video on that some time
about<00:02:32.190> the<00:02:32.250> worst<00:02:33.060> time<00:02:33.330> to<00:02:33.360> travel<00:02:33.780> in<00:02:33.840> Costa

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
about the worst time to travel in Costa

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.020 
about the worst time to travel in Costa
Rica<00:02:34.440> but<00:02:34.710> that<00:02:35.040> could<00:02:35.220> be<00:02:35.250> it<00:02:35.490> October

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
Rica but that could be it October

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.910 
Rica but that could be it October
November<00:02:36.270> are<00:02:36.900> the<00:02:37.410> end<00:02:37.530> of<00:02:37.590> the<00:02:37.650> rainy<00:02:37.830> season

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
November are the end of the rainy season

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.890 
November are the end of the rainy season
where<00:02:38.400> the<00:02:38.520> lands<00:02:38.730> just<00:02:38.880> saturated<00:02:39.630> with<00:02:39.750> all

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
where the lands just saturated with all

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.900 
where the lands just saturated with all
this<00:02:40.080> rain<00:02:40.380> and<00:02:40.590> there's<00:02:41.100> lots<00:02:41.340> of<00:02:41.490> floods<00:02:41.790> and

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
this rain and there's lots of floods and

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:44.060 
this rain and there's lots of floods and
lots<00:02:42.120> of<00:02:42.240> landslides<00:02:42.750> down<00:02:43.050> here<00:02:43.320> so<00:02:43.530> bridges

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:44.070 
lots of landslides down here so bridges

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:45.350 
lots of landslides down here so bridges
get<00:02:44.220> washed<00:02:44.490> out<00:02:44.760> they<00:02:45.000> have<00:02:45.090> to<00:02:45.150> put

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360 
get washed out they have to put

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:47.410 
get washed out they have to put
temporary<00:02:45.720> bridges<00:02:46.380> in<00:02:46.590> that<00:02:46.800> are<00:02:46.890> one-way

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
temporary bridges in that are one-way

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.090 
temporary bridges in that are one-way
changes<00:02:48.420> the<00:02:48.690> whole<00:02:48.870> time<00:02:49.230> landslides<00:02:49.920> you

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
changes the whole time landslides you

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.830 
changes the whole time landslides you
just<00:02:50.370> stop<00:02:50.640> and<00:02:50.940> you<00:02:51.000> can't<00:02:51.270> go<00:02:51.480> anywhere

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
just stop and you can't go anywhere

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.600 
just stop and you can't go anywhere
you're<00:02:51.990> turned<00:02:52.290> around<00:02:52.470> you're<00:02:52.860> losing<00:02:53.250> hours

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:53.610 
you're turned around you're losing hours

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.460 
you're turned around you're losing hours
so<00:02:54.180> it's<00:02:54.360> definitely<00:02:54.660> the<00:02:54.720> worst<00:02:54.930> month<00:02:55.200> which

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
so it's definitely the worst month which

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.980 
so it's definitely the worst month which
may<00:02:56.310> not<00:02:56.520> be<00:02:56.670> a<00:02:56.700> bad<00:02:56.970> time<00:02:57.240> to<00:02:57.300> consider<00:02:57.840> a

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:57.990 
may not be a bad time to consider a

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:00.560 
may not be a bad time to consider a
shuttle<00:02:58.440> service<00:02:58.650> at<00:02:59.160> that<00:02:59.490> time<00:02:59.760> if<00:03:00.030> you<00:03:00.090> plan

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
shuttle service at that time if you plan

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:02.150 
shuttle service at that time if you plan
on<00:03:00.600> coming<00:03:00.960> here<00:03:01.290> around<00:03:01.620> october/november

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160

want<00:03:04.170> to<00:03:04.260> drive<00:03:04.470> and<00:03:04.770> then<00:03:05.010> it's<00:03:05.190> mostly

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:05.490 
want to drive and then it's mostly

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:07.670 
want to drive and then it's mostly
because<00:03:05.670> around<00:03:06.570> that<00:03:06.720> time<00:03:07.020> what<00:03:07.260> they<00:03:07.410> know

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:07.680 
because around that time what they know

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.020 
because around that time what they know
when<00:03:07.860> the<00:03:07.980> roads<00:03:08.010> are<00:03:08.220> gonna<00:03:08.340> be<00:03:08.430> closed<00:03:08.790> they

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:09.030 
when the roads are gonna be closed they

00:03:09.030 --> 00:03:11.180 
when the roads are gonna be closed they
know<00:03:09.150> if<00:03:09.300> the<00:03:09.450> roads<00:03:09.660> are<00:03:10.110> closed<00:03:10.590> or<00:03:10.860> they

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:11.190 
know if the roads are closed or they

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:13.910 
know if the roads are closed or they
detour<00:03:11.820> routes<00:03:12.150> they<00:03:12.450> they<00:03:13.230> know<00:03:13.410> the<00:03:13.560> country

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
detour routes they they know the country

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.230 
detour routes they they know the country
a<00:03:13.950> little<00:03:14.040> more<00:03:14.280> than<00:03:14.459> you<00:03:14.580> do<00:03:14.700> so<00:03:15.060> they<00:03:15.150> can

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:15.240 
a little more than you do so they can

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:16.699 
a little more than you do so they can
get<00:03:15.330> you<00:03:15.480> from<00:03:15.660> point<00:03:15.690> A<00:03:16.050> to<00:03:16.080> point<00:03:16.290> B<00:03:16.560> uh

00:03:16.699 --> 00:03:16.709 
get you from point A to point B uh

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:19.010 
get you from point A to point B uh
probably<00:03:17.070> a<00:03:17.310> lot<00:03:17.400> quicker<00:03:17.850> now<00:03:18.630> if<00:03:18.870> you're
