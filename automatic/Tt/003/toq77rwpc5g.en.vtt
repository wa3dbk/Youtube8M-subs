00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:06.380
 3 Request 

00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:09.850
 I accepted the request 

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:13.830
 Take your foot off the accelerator brake 

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:13.830
 Please release the hand from the handle 

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:22.960
 It looks like a normal scene where a medical-sized truck and three passenger cars are running at first glance, but if this leaves 

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:28.070
 Re project is the so-called road train test 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:32.060
 This is the world's first test on a freeway where general vehicles also run 

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:37.520
 We have developed a demonstration car over the past two and a half years 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:40.430
 And it can be made to finally run once a high-speed on the road can show you to everyone like the 

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:43.350
 I am really happy 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:46.920
 The benefits of roadtrains vary 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:53.220
 It is very convenient because you can do things other than driving 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:01:01.340
 Furthermore, since the system operates, it is safe without human error 

00:00:53.220 --> 00:01:01.340
 And by reducing the distance between vehicles , air resistance is reduced and fuel consumption is improved. 

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:13.079
 This run test was conducted outside Barcelona 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:20.250
 The purpose is to do a two-man wirelessly with the leading vehicle driven by a professional driver 

00:01:13.079 --> 00:01:23.450
 How in the traffic situation in which a general vehicle comes and goes with a formation consisting of four vehicles following 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:23.450
 It is to see what to do 

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:35.930
 There are many advantages to eliminating the need for steering wheel operation and accelerator brake operation 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:36.410
 From'm interesting to have seen the car go overtaking I have read the Meide magazine to the operation 

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:44.950
 look 

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:44.950
 Everyone really surprised I she really look back I do not have to drive 

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:54.350
 While riding a car running at 85 km / h, which was guided by another company 

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:57.409
 We investigated how the driver and passengers felt 

00:01:54.350 --> 00:02:00.570
 The understanding of this technology deepens with time 

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:05.520
 People will also be accepted 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:11.990
 I think that the younger the generation, the faster the understanding is accepted by more people 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:15.680
 My son also seems to be interested and says that I want to see quickly where it is actually used 

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:20.860
 Monkey training stands for safe roadtrain for the environment 

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:25.630
 It is a joint project of eu where seven partners including Volvo Cars participate 

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:29.710
 Three years have passed from the children , but the project members have also taken the test in Spain this time 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:35.620
 I regarded as an important milestone that many things were obtained 

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:41.890
 There is also traveling in a lot of general vehicles also also very strong wind were successful hill today 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:43.710
 I really did have an advantage because I could still confirm that the system worked without any problems 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:47.940
 I think 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:53.580
 It turned out that this technology is certain in this way 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:59.090
 You should have a broad understanding of how this technology can help reduce traffic safety and fuel consumption 

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:59.090
 Advancement of the law will be a big step to practical application
