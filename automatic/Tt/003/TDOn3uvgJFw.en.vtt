mode<00:03:11.200> what<00:03:12.200> this<00:03:12.380> does<00:03:12.590> is<00:03:12.829> when<00:03:13.310> the<00:03:13.850> unit<00:03:14.150> is

00:03:14.229 --> 00:03:14.239

hit<00:03:14.540> with<00:03:15.350> a<00:03:15.410> laser<00:03:15.620> gun<00:03:15.799> a<00:03:16.130> laser<00:03:17.060> speed<00:03:17.389> gun

hit with a laser gun a laser speed gun

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.430 
hit with a laser gun a laser speed gun
it'll<00:03:18.650> return<00:03:18.980> various<00:03:20.049> nonsense<00:03:21.049> signals

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:21.440 
it'll return various nonsense signals

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.020 
it'll return various nonsense signals
back<00:03:21.590> to<00:03:21.709> the<00:03:21.829> gun<00:03:21.980> and<00:03:22.250> so<00:03:22.519> the<00:03:22.609> gun<00:03:22.760> can't

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
back to the gun and so the gun can't

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.120 
back to the gun and so the gun can't
read<00:03:23.299> your<00:03:23.450> speed<00:03:23.750> so<00:03:24.500> I<00:03:24.530> can<00:03:24.709> turn<00:03:24.829> that<00:03:24.950> off

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:25.130 
read your speed so I can turn that off

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:27.759 
read your speed so I can turn that off
and<00:03:25.310> on<00:03:25.370> here<00:03:25.670> when<00:03:25.940> that<00:03:26.060> goes<00:03:26.239> on<00:03:26.389> it<00:03:26.900> makes<00:03:27.620> a

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:27.769 
and on here when that goes on it makes a

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:30.220 
and on here when that goes on it makes a
very<00:03:27.950> shrill<00:03:28.340> alarm<00:03:28.700> sound<00:03:29.120> the<00:03:29.750> idea<00:03:30.049> is<00:03:30.109> that

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
very shrill alarm sound the idea is that

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:33.009 
very shrill alarm sound the idea is that
when<00:03:30.470> that<00:03:30.500> occurs<00:03:30.920> you<00:03:31.400> turn<00:03:31.700> it<00:03:31.819> off<00:03:31.940> and<00:03:32.540> the

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:33.019 
when that occurs you turn it off and the

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:34.210 
when that occurs you turn it off and the
police<00:03:33.260> can<00:03:33.530> get<00:03:33.650> an<00:03:33.769> accurate<00:03:33.950> reading

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:34.220 
police can get an accurate reading

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.089 
police can get an accurate reading
accurate<00:03:35.030> speed<00:03:35.269> reading<00:03:35.739> when<00:03:36.739> you<00:03:36.859> pass<00:03:37.069> by

00:03:37.089 --> 00:03:37.099 
accurate speed reading when you pass by

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:38.890 
accurate speed reading when you pass by
and<00:03:37.549> you<00:03:37.670> can<00:03:37.790> even<00:03:38.060> turn<00:03:38.239> the<00:03:38.359> system<00:03:38.480> back<00:03:38.720> on

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:38.900 
and you can even turn the system back on

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:51.600 
and you can even turn the system back on
again

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:51.610 

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:56.970 

and

00:03:56.970 --> 00:03:56.980 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:03:58.630 

so<00:03:57.980> that's<00:03:58.129> like<00:03:58.220> that's<00:03:58.370> a<00:03:58.489> quick

00:03:58.630 --> 00:03:58.640 
so that's like that's a quick
