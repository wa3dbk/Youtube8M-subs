00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:07.460
 hello how do you see this 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:11.389
 me working now or wanting to rewind 

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:14.370
 these strings are vcds strings 

00:00:11.389 --> 00:00:18.300
 earlier here in this box of them and you with 

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:20.670
 these little thing I put the trays 

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.430
 Now here so here is no strings 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.410
 You can see some rooms and settlements by 

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.599
 numbers all grow but unfortunately on 

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:30.349
 the road is not enough for them because there is no all 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.850
 much and I have some 

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:36.660
 allover color it is wound on the 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:39.090
 the same hutch which is here so 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.640
 if not then take a new one accordingly 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:44.280
 Papa rich here such from cardboard 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.440
 cut here from the room let's say there is 

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.980
 there are numbers 

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:53.879
 since this number is no longer in principle 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:58.980
 I need to stick this thing up 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:01:01.379
 ribbon and accordingly I am writing this 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.830
 number and put it in kanter 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:07.500
 there are some and let's see 

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:09.450
 how do i do it all yes it is complicated 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:12.720
 process because all the same to the point not 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:14.729
 so little and the prize will not be such Vanya 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.680
 shield at the moment promotion tass 

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.080
 remained practically nothing nitochek 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:21.450
 here are the threads that I rewound 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:23.580
 I wanted to count how many all 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:26.009
 it will be but then decided now on 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:29.520
 Currently you can leave it just right 

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:31.710
 will bake it here because time 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.320
 not many already just a sole 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:40.619
 I do nâ€™t want to sleep here 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:43.799
 nowhere from me cool up to k boy here 

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:45.950
 and let's see how all the same I 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:48.420
 cleaned everything up 

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.610
 congratulate her finally 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:54.119
 completion already because in fact 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:59.750
 I'm tired and that's how it is 

00:01:54.119 --> 00:02:02.490
 all you play but it 's not all yet 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:06.000
 900 you now they will show you here 

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:08.729
 I have a jar here 900 is not the world and to 

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.430
 Sorry to have yaha on that a little bit more 

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:12.690
 the threads are quite a bit of that again 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:15.180
 need to rewind 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:18.150
 so video shoot me in one day 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:20.670
 I hope I will fix it quickly 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.770
 written here are such honest world what 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.530
 we act on a piece of paper for now 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:29.130
 then most likely not just write out 

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.490
 to separate bloom leaf and there 

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.430
 will be 

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:35.100
 earth numbers are about what else is not there well 

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.980
 disassembled and yet all the threads that is 

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:40.350
 10 strings will be such a box yes 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:43.380
 Now here are outside too 

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:47.370
 I show the list and which is not right 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:51.510
 there and here there is more if mandera cars 

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:54.980
 and some strings think if spar 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:57.720
 the reason that you have a lot of them for daddies 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:00.300
 10900 and as I said and will 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:03.750
 I wrote on such a mini notebook 

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:06.600
 vomited old coconut with spring 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:11.090
 lads at the behest of the rink so recorded 

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:13.740
 all numbering chip moved away from the plus sign 

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.310
 which i have it 10 there two 

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:16.980
 dots 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:19.530
 this strings still show you which 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:24.630
 I left some sets they me 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:28.200
 it's hard to get photos into this little thing 

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:32.209
 this is how it looks 

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:36.300
 and in me it turned out that I have 

00:03:32.209 --> 00:03:39.060
 313 hanks of strings of flowers so I 

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:43.920
 insanely insanely happy in principle to 

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:45.150
 full not much fill though i and 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:49.320
 was not going to 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:52.260
 but let's see how and what will happen so here 

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:55.500
 such and still the body is all moved 

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:57.570
 I'll put it here so that everyone 

00:03:55.500 --> 00:04:01.370
 thank you so much for watching hope you 

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:04.820
 I liked to take the strings with me and 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:04.820
 bye everyone
