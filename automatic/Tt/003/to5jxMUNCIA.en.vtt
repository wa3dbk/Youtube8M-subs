00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:17.130 
but to be honest it doesn't really

00:00:17.130 --> 00:00:18.830 
but to be honest it doesn't really
matter<00:00:17.400> which<00:00:17.670> brand<00:00:18.000> you<00:00:18.150> decide<00:00:18.449> to<00:00:18.600> buy

few protects in I'm going to leave the
front<00:02:55.139> section<00:02:55.680> out<00:02:55.859> for<00:02:56.609> now<00:02:56.760> just<00:02:57.090> because

00:02:57.409 --> 00:02:57.419 
front section out for now just because

00:02:57.419 --> 00:03:02.509 
front section out for now just because
that's<00:02:57.569> the<00:02:57.720> best<00:02:57.989> bit<00:02:58.200> to<00:02:58.319> put<00:02:58.500> in<00:02:58.680> small<00:03:01.519> size

00:03:02.509 --> 00:03:02.519 
that's the best bit to put in small size

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:05.000 
that's the best bit to put in small size
rollers<00:03:03.030> if<00:03:03.150> you<00:03:03.269> have<00:03:03.419> it<00:03:03.650> so<00:03:04.650> I'm<00:03:04.739> just<00:03:04.859> going

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
rollers if you have it so I'm just going

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.399 
rollers if you have it so I'm just going
to<00:03:05.040> continue<00:03:05.430> doing<00:03:05.579> exactly<00:03:05.969> the<00:03:06.150> same<00:03:06.409> on

00:03:07.399 --> 00:03:07.409 
to continue doing exactly the same on

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:21.440 
to continue doing exactly the same on
the<00:03:07.769> top<00:03:07.950> layer

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:24.630 

so<00:03:22.450> once<00:03:22.780> I've<00:03:23.200> run<00:03:23.530> out<00:03:23.709> of<00:03:23.739> the<00:03:24.190> bigger<00:03:24.430> size

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 
so once I've run out of the bigger size

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:26.370 
so once I've run out of the bigger size
rollers<00:03:24.880> I'm<00:03:25.060> going<00:03:25.209> to<00:03:25.270> just<00:03:25.450> use<00:03:25.989> two

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:26.380 
rollers I'm going to just use two

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:28.500 
rollers I'm going to just use two
smaller<00:03:26.830> ones<00:03:27.069> for<00:03:27.310> the<00:03:27.370> front<00:03:27.640> and<00:03:28.300> you<00:03:28.390> just

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 
smaller ones for the front and you just

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.210 
smaller ones for the front and you just
want<00:03:28.690> to<00:03:28.750> do<00:03:28.840> it<00:03:28.900> in<00:03:29.080> exactly<00:03:29.470> the<00:03:29.650> same<00:03:29.830> way<00:03:29.980> if

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:30.220 
want to do it in exactly the same way if

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.220 
want to do it in exactly the same way if
you<00:03:30.250> have<00:03:30.400> more<00:03:30.730> big<00:03:30.940> ones<00:03:31.180> then<00:03:31.900> definitely

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:32.230 
you have more big ones then definitely

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:34.260 
you have more big ones then definitely
carry<00:03:32.890> on<00:03:33.130> using<00:03:33.340> the<00:03:33.610> bigger<00:03:33.790> ones<00:03:34.000> for<00:03:34.209> the

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:34.270 
carry on using the bigger ones for the

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:35.640 
carry on using the bigger ones for the
front<00:03:34.510> because<00:03:34.690> it<00:03:34.810> will<00:03:34.900> create<00:03:35.020> a<00:03:35.200> bit<00:03:35.380> more

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
front because it will create a bit more

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:39.030 
front because it will create a bit more
volume<00:03:36.580> but<00:03:37.239> you<00:03:37.390> can<00:03:37.690> and<00:03:38.110> this<00:03:38.739> is<00:03:38.860> what<00:03:39.010> I

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 
volume but you can and this is what I

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.759 
volume but you can and this is what I
tend<00:03:39.370> to<00:03:39.489> do<00:03:39.610> as<00:03:39.700> well<00:03:39.940> is<00:03:40.209> just<00:03:40.450> create<00:03:41.050> the

00:03:41.759 --> 00:03:41.769 
tend to do as well is just create the

00:03:41.769 --> 00:03:44.490 
tend to do as well is just create the
shape<00:03:42.040> that<00:03:42.069> you<00:03:42.310> want<00:03:42.519> at<00:03:43.510> the<00:03:43.660> front<00:03:43.930> mainly

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:44.500 
shape that you want at the front mainly

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.470 
shape that you want at the front mainly
using<00:03:44.769> strainers<00:03:45.280> after<00:03:46.000> I<00:03:46.030> take<00:03:46.209> the<00:03:46.330> rolls

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 
using strainers after I take the rolls

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:51.479 
using strainers after I take the rolls
out<00:03:46.720> so<00:03:47.650> I'm<00:03:47.860> just<00:03:47.980> gonna<00:03:48.099> clip<00:03:48.310> these<00:03:48.489> in<00:03:50.489> okay

00:03:51.479 --> 00:03:51.489 
out so I'm just gonna clip these in okay

00:03:51.489 --> 00:03:52.620 
out so I'm just gonna clip these in okay
so<00:03:51.550> once<00:03:51.880> you're<00:03:52.030> done<00:03:52.060> you're<00:03:52.330> gonna<00:03:52.450> look

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.630 
so once you're done you're gonna look

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:54.600 
so once you're done you're gonna look
really<00:03:53.140> under<00:03:53.470> morose<00:03:53.709> and<00:03:53.860> grannyish<00:03:54.400> but

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:54.610 
really under morose and grannyish but

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:55.770 
really under morose and grannyish but
you<00:03:54.670> want<00:03:54.850> to<00:03:54.880> wait<00:03:55.030> about<00:03:55.209> twenty-five

00:03:55.770 --> 00:03:55.780 
you want to wait about twenty-five

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:57.270 
you want to wait about twenty-five
minutes<00:03:55.810> to<00:03:56.140> half<00:03:56.290> an<00:03:56.410> hour<00:03:56.530> just<00:03:57.010> for<00:03:57.100> the

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 
minutes to half an hour just for the

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.610 
minutes to half an hour just for the
rollers<00:03:57.610> to<00:03:57.760> cool<00:03:58.030> down<00:03:58.299> so<00:03:58.810> I<00:03:58.840> will<00:03:59.140> see<00:03:59.410> you

00:03:59.610 --> 00:03:59.620 
rollers to cool down so I will see you

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.699 
rollers to cool down so I will see you
in<00:03:59.860> a<00:03:59.980> bit<00:04:00.160> okay<00:04:00.489> so<00:04:00.880> once<00:04:01.420> the<00:04:01.600> rollers<00:04:02.560> have

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:02.709 
in a bit okay so once the rollers have

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:04.440 
in a bit okay so once the rollers have
cooled<00:04:03.010> down<00:04:03.190> I'm<00:04:03.430> just<00:04:03.459> gonna<00:04:03.670> switch<00:04:03.880> on<00:04:04.239> my

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:04.450 
cooled down I'm just gonna switch on my

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:05.729 
cooled down I'm just gonna switch on my
hair<00:04:04.630> straighteners<00:04:04.989> and<00:04:05.140> let<00:04:05.260> them<00:04:05.410> heat<00:04:05.590> up

00:04:05.729 --> 00:04:05.739 
hair straighteners and let them heat up

00:04:05.739 --> 00:04:06.839 
hair straighteners and let them heat up
but<00:04:05.890> I'll<00:04:05.980> get<00:04:06.160> back<00:04:06.310> to<00:04:06.430> them<00:04:06.549> in<00:04:06.580> a<00:04:06.700> moment

00:04:06.839 --> 00:04:06.849 
but I'll get back to them in a moment

00:04:06.849 --> 00:04:08.880 
but I'll get back to them in a moment
what<00:04:07.480> you<00:04:07.599> want<00:04:07.780> to<00:04:07.870> start<00:04:08.170> doing<00:04:08.380> is<00:04:08.680> just

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:08.890 
what you want to start doing is just

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:11.460 
what you want to start doing is just
take<00:04:09.130> out<00:04:09.370> the<00:04:09.519> rollers<00:04:09.880> one<00:04:10.090> by<00:04:10.299> one<00:04:10.510> from<00:04:11.260> the

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:11.470 
take out the rollers one by one from the

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:13.140 
take out the rollers one by one from the
bottom<00:04:11.830> so<00:04:11.980> I'm<00:04:12.069> just<00:04:12.190> gonna<00:04:12.340> unclip<00:04:12.760> it<00:04:12.880> first

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.150 
bottom so I'm just gonna unclip it first

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:16.319 
bottom so I'm just gonna unclip it first
and<00:04:13.599> then<00:04:14.440> unroll<00:04:15.130> the<00:04:15.280> curl<00:04:15.519> and<00:04:15.819> once<00:04:16.209> you've

00:04:16.319 --> 00:04:16.329 
and then unroll the curl and once you've

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:17.789 
and then unroll the curl and once you've
done<00:04:16.450> that<00:04:16.600> you<00:04:16.690> just<00:04:16.720> want<00:04:16.870> to<00:04:17.049> roll<00:04:17.769> it

00:04:17.789 --> 00:04:17.799 
done that you just want to roll it

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:20.069 
done that you just want to roll it
around<00:04:18.010> your<00:04:18.280> finger<00:04:18.760> just<00:04:19.030> to<00:04:19.840> make<00:04:20.049> sure

00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:20.079 
around your finger just to make sure

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:22.080 
around your finger just to make sure
it's<00:04:20.440> all<00:04:20.650> nice<00:04:21.100> and<00:04:21.130> together<00:04:21.519> and<00:04:21.850> as<00:04:21.940> you

00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:22.090 
it's all nice and together and as you

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:25.800 
it's all nice and together and as you
can<00:04:22.270> see<00:04:22.479> you<00:04:22.660> get<00:04:22.870> a<00:04:23.050> nice<00:04:23.560> loose<00:04:24.310> wave<00:04:25.090> so

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 
can see you get a nice loose wave so

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:26.969 
can see you get a nice loose wave so
what<00:04:25.990> I'm<00:04:26.050> gonna<00:04:26.169> do<00:04:26.320> with<00:04:26.410> my<00:04:26.530> straightness

00:04:26.969 --> 00:04:26.979 
what I'm gonna do with my straightness

00:04:26.979 --> 00:04:28.469 
what I'm gonna do with my straightness
now<00:04:27.160> actually<00:04:27.700> is<00:04:27.910> that<00:04:28.090> I<00:04:28.150> don't<00:04:28.390> know

00:04:28.469 --> 00:04:28.479 
now actually is that I don't know

00:04:28.479 --> 00:04:29.700 
now actually is that I don't know
whether<00:04:28.600> you<00:04:28.810> guys<00:04:28.870> will<00:04:29.110> be<00:04:29.140> able<00:04:29.320> to<00:04:29.410> see<00:04:29.560> but

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 
whether you guys will be able to see but

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:31.590 
whether you guys will be able to see but
as<00:04:29.860> I'm<00:04:30.039> pulling<00:04:30.430> the<00:04:30.940> rollers<00:04:31.270> out<00:04:31.419> and<00:04:31.570> I

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:31.600 
as I'm pulling the rollers out and I

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:32.670 
as I'm pulling the rollers out and I
don't<00:04:31.780> know<00:04:31.840> whether<00:04:31.930> this<00:04:32.110> actually<00:04:32.320> fault

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:32.680 
don't know whether this actually fault

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:34.290 
don't know whether this actually fault
would<00:04:32.800> just<00:04:32.979> use<00:04:33.130> rollers<00:04:33.520> but<00:04:33.640> I<00:04:33.700> tend<00:04:34.030> to<00:04:34.090> get

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:34.300 
would just use rollers but I tend to get

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:36.930 
would just use rollers but I tend to get
sometimes<00:04:35.229> get<00:04:35.530> like<00:04:35.650> a<00:04:35.680> line<00:04:36.070> like<00:04:36.550> a<00:04:36.580> crease

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:36.940 
sometimes get like a line like a crease

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:39.270 
sometimes get like a line like a crease
where<00:04:37.300> the<00:04:37.539> clamp<00:04:38.260> has<00:04:38.530> been<00:04:38.560> holding<00:04:39.039> on<00:04:39.160> to

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:39.280 
where the clamp has been holding on to

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:40.860 
where the clamp has been holding on to
it<00:04:39.430> I'm<00:04:39.729> pretty<00:04:39.970> sure<00:04:40.210> it<00:04:40.300> is<00:04:40.419> with<00:04:40.720> these

00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:40.870 
it I'm pretty sure it is with these

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:43.050 
it I'm pretty sure it is with these
rollers<00:04:41.289> because<00:04:41.410> of<00:04:41.680> the<00:04:41.770> heated<00:04:42.100> clamps<00:04:42.880> but

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:43.060 
rollers because of the heated clamps but

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:46.110 
rollers because of the heated clamps but
I<00:04:43.240> also<00:04:43.510> find<00:04:43.960> it<00:04:44.140> helps<00:04:44.530> to<00:04:45.130> kind<00:04:45.280> of<00:04:45.430> smooth

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:46.120 
I also find it helps to kind of smooth

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.790 
I also find it helps to kind of smooth
the<00:04:46.450> top<00:04:46.810> part<00:04:47.110> of<00:04:47.140> your<00:04:47.200> hair<00:04:47.410> where<00:04:47.560> there<00:04:47.680> is

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:47.800 
the top part of your hair where there is

00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:49.680 
the top part of your hair where there is
no<00:04:48.039> curl<00:04:48.340> if<00:04:48.610> you<00:04:49.090> just<00:04:49.270> run<00:04:49.479> your

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:49.690 
no curl if you just run your

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:52.320 
no curl if you just run your
straightness<00:04:50.260> through<00:04:51.130> the<00:04:51.400> very<00:04:51.669> very<00:04:51.970> root

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:52.330 
straightness through the very very root

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:55.230 
straightness through the very very root
of<00:04:52.600> the<00:04:52.720> hair<00:04:53.160> so<00:04:54.160> once<00:04:54.340> I've<00:04:54.520> taken<00:04:54.729> out<00:04:54.970> each

your straighteners around as you're

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:22.200 
your straighteners around as you're
doing<00:05:19.270> it<00:05:19.419> so<00:05:20.070> that<00:05:21.070> pulls<00:05:21.520> it<00:05:21.669> away<00:05:21.760> from<00:05:22.090> the

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:22.210 
doing it so that pulls it away from the

00:05:22.210 --> 00:05:24.090 
doing it so that pulls it away from the
root<00:05:22.360> and<00:05:22.389> doesn't<00:05:22.780> flatten<00:05:23.020> it<00:05:23.260> and<00:05:23.500> like<00:05:23.950> I

00:05:24.090 --> 00:05:24.100 
root and doesn't flatten it and like I

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:26.219 
root and doesn't flatten it and like I
said<00:05:24.280> before<00:05:24.430> what<00:05:24.820> I<00:05:24.850> like<00:05:25.090> to<00:05:25.210> do<00:05:25.389> with<00:05:26.050> the

00:05:26.219 --> 00:05:26.229 
said before what I like to do with the

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:29.100 
said before what I like to do with the
front<00:05:26.530> is<00:05:26.740> usually<00:05:27.220> just<00:05:27.430> kind<00:05:27.610> of<00:05:27.810> shape<00:05:28.810> them

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:29.110 
front is usually just kind of shape them

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:30.510 
front is usually just kind of shape them
how<00:05:29.289> I<00:05:29.320> want<00:05:29.620> them<00:05:29.770> with<00:05:29.919> the<00:05:30.010> straight<00:05:30.280> lines

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:30.520 
how I want them with the straight lines

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:31.830 
how I want them with the straight lines
rather<00:05:30.700> than<00:05:30.970> with<00:05:31.090> the<00:05:31.120> rollers<00:05:31.570> because<00:05:31.750> you

00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:31.840 
rather than with the rollers because you

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:50.210 
rather than with the rollers because you
can<00:05:31.990> be<00:05:32.140> a<00:05:32.349> little<00:05:33.130> bit<00:05:33.280> more<00:05:33.460> precise

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:50.220 

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:52.170 

okay<00:05:51.220> so<00:05:51.280> once<00:05:51.550> you've<00:05:51.639> done<00:05:51.729> that<00:05:51.789> you<00:05:51.970> should

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:52.180 
okay so once you've done that you should

00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:53.760 
okay so once you've done that you should
be<00:05:52.360> left<00:05:52.599> with<00:05:52.780> something<00:05:53.169> that<00:05:53.440> looks<00:05:53.620> a

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:53.770

little<00:05:53.919> bit<00:05:54.129> like<00:05:54.340> this<00:05:54.669> so<00:05:54.729> lots<00:05:55.270> of<00:05:55.419> volume

00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:55.690 
little bit like this so lots of volume

00:05:55.690 --> 00:05:58.170 
little bit like this so lots of volume
and<00:05:56.110> curls<00:05:57.009> especially<00:05:57.580> in<00:05:57.729> the<00:05:57.819> end<00:05:57.940> so<00:05:58.090> what

00:05:58.170 --> 00:05:58.180 
and curls especially in the end so what
