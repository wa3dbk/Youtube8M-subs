it quite a lot and she always said it
never<00:01:53.280> tasted<00:01:53.700> the<00:01:53.850> same<00:01:54.060> as<00:01:54.329> how<00:01:54.659> grandma

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
never tasted the same as how grandma

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:58.280 
never tasted the same as how grandma
makes<00:01:55.350> it<00:01:55.590> so<00:01:56.579> one<00:01:57.270> day<00:01:57.479> while<00:01:57.780> she<00:01:58.020> was<00:01:58.140> making

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
makes it so one day while she was making

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.639 
makes it so one day while she was making
the<00:01:58.649> she<00:01:58.860> asked<00:01:59.009> grandma<00:01:59.490> what<00:02:00.049> she<00:02:01.049> does<00:02:01.290> and

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
the she asked grandma what she does and

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.999 
the she asked grandma what she does and
all<00:02:02.280> the<00:02:02.840> basically<00:02:03.840> the<00:02:03.960> only<00:02:04.079> difference<00:02:04.619> we

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:05.009 
all the basically the only difference we

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.609 
all the basically the only difference we
found<00:02:05.280> was<00:02:05.579> that<00:02:05.689> mom<00:02:06.689> used<00:02:06.930> to<00:02:07.020> add<00:02:07.200> holly

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:07.619 
found was that mom used to add holly

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:11.270 
found was that mom used to add holly
which<00:02:08.099> is<00:02:08.280> turmeric<00:02:08.670> powder<00:02:09.000> to<00:02:09.890> her<00:02:10.890> filling

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:11.280 
which is turmeric powder to her filling

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.530 
which is turmeric powder to her filling
whereas<00:02:11.640> grandma<00:02:12.000> didn't

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
whereas grandma didn't

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:14.000 
whereas grandma didn't
now<00:02:12.719> we<00:02:12.780> make<00:02:13.079> it<00:02:13.260> without<00:02:13.409> the<00:02:13.650> turmeric

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
now we make it without the turmeric

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.940 
now we make it without the turmeric
powder<00:02:14.340> and<00:02:14.760> we<00:02:15.750> realize<00:02:16.170> that<00:02:16.200> even<00:02:16.620> the

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
powder and we realize that even the

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.339 
powder and we realize that even the
tiniest<00:02:17.370> thing<00:02:17.790> can<00:02:18.329> make<00:02:18.540> a<00:02:18.900> really<00:02:19.230> big

00:02:19.339 --> 00:02:19.349 
tiniest thing can make a really big

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:21.949 
tiniest thing can make a really big
difference<00:02:19.530> to<00:02:20.099> the<00:02:20.219> flavor<00:02:20.489> so<00:02:21.329> this<00:02:21.689> is<00:02:21.840> why

00:02:21.949 --> 00:02:21.959 
difference to the flavor so this is why

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:23.030 
difference to the flavor so this is why
we<00:02:22.140> like<00:02:22.319> to<00:02:22.469> stick<00:02:22.680> to<00:02:22.799> the<00:02:22.890> traditional

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
we like to stick to the traditional

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.569 
we like to stick to the traditional
recipes<00:02:23.849> when<00:02:24.060> we<00:02:24.269> cook<00:02:24.689> on<00:02:24.840> the<00:02:24.959> show<00:02:25.579> once

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:26.579 
recipes when we cook on the show once

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:29.750 
recipes when we cook on the show once
the<00:02:26.939> bitter<00:02:27.150> gourd<00:02:27.480> has<00:02:27.840> been<00:02:28.170> filled<00:02:28.760> we're

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:29.760 
the bitter gourd has been filled we're

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.660 
the bitter gourd has been filled we're
going<00:02:30.000> to<00:02:30.209> get<00:02:30.510> a<00:02:30.569> string<00:02:31.049> and<00:02:31.319> tie<00:02:31.650> it<00:02:31.709> around

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
going to get a string and tie it around

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:35.899 
going to get a string and tie it around
quiet<00:02:33.060> tightly<00:02:34.159> this<00:02:35.159> is<00:02:35.340> so<00:02:35.489> that<00:02:35.640> when<00:02:35.790> we

00:02:35.899 --> 00:02:35.909 
quiet tightly this is so that when we

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:37.550 
quiet tightly this is so that when we
fry<00:02:36.150> the<00:02:36.209> bitter<00:02:36.540> gourd<00:02:36.840> it<00:02:37.019> doesn't<00:02:37.319> fall

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
fry the bitter gourd it doesn't fall

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.589 
fry the bitter gourd it doesn't fall
apart<00:02:37.950> and<00:02:38.159> it<00:02:38.250> stays<00:02:38.489> in<00:02:38.519> one<00:02:38.700> piece<00:02:39.030> and<00:02:39.329> the

00:02:39.589 --> 00:02:39.599 
apart and it stays in one piece and the

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:41.319 
apart and it stays in one piece and the
filling<00:02:39.930> inside<00:02:40.079> doesn't<00:02:40.439> come<00:02:40.709> outside

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:41.329 
filling inside doesn't come outside

00:02:41.329 --> 00:02:44.899 
filling inside doesn't come outside
we're<00:02:42.329> going<00:02:42.540> to<00:02:42.719> fry<00:02:43.409> this<00:02:43.469> on<00:02:44.069> a<00:02:44.129> medium<00:02:44.670> heat

00:02:44.899 --> 00:02:44.909 
we're going to fry this on a medium heat

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:46.849 
we're going to fry this on a medium heat
this<00:02:45.180> is<00:02:45.239> because<00:02:45.810> the<00:02:46.139> bitter<00:02:46.439> gourd<00:02:46.769> is

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:46.859 
this is because the bitter gourd is

00:02:46.859 --> 00:02:48.979 
this is because the bitter gourd is
actually<00:02:47.250> quite<00:02:47.670> thick<00:02:48.090> so<00:02:48.389> we<00:02:48.420> don't<00:02:48.750> want<00:02:48.930> it

00:02:48.979 --> 00:02:48.989 
actually quite thick so we don't want it

00:02:48.989 --> 00:02:51.020 
actually quite thick so we don't want it
to<00:02:49.170> be<00:02:49.290> wrong<00:02:49.530> the<00:02:49.829> inside<00:02:50.159> and<00:02:50.370> overcooked<00:02:50.909> on

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.030 
to be wrong the inside and overcooked on

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:54.080 
to be wrong the inside and overcooked on
the<00:02:51.180> outside<00:02:52.069> for<00:02:53.069> people<00:02:53.430> who<00:02:53.549> haven't<00:02:53.760> tried

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
the outside for people who haven't tried

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:56.690 
the outside for people who haven't tried
bitter<00:02:54.510> gourd<00:02:54.840> before<00:02:55.230> this<00:02:55.439> might<00:02:55.799> be<00:02:56.069> a<00:02:56.099> very
