but somewhere on the lower armoire we

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:10.490 
but somewhere on the lower armoire we
were<00:00:09.150> playing<00:00:09.420> the<00:00:09.599> paddle<00:00:10.019> a<00:00:10.080> thousand

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
were playing the paddle a thousand

were playing the paddle a thousand
kilometers<00:00:10.950> somewhere<00:00:11.849> along<00:00:12.450> the<00:00:12.690> way<00:00:12.719> I

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
kilometers somewhere along the way I

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.709 
kilometers somewhere along the way I
started<00:00:13.950> to<00:00:14.099> get<00:00:14.219> a<00:00:14.280> really<00:00:14.790> sick<00:00:15.150> feeling<00:00:15.450> in

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719 
started to get a really sick feeling in

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:18.890 
started to get a really sick feeling in
my<00:00:15.780> stomach<00:00:15.900> and<00:00:16.680> I<00:00:17.039> said<00:00:17.310> I<00:00:17.490> think<00:00:17.820> we<00:00:18.600> need<00:00:18.630> to

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:18.900 
my stomach and I said I think we need to

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.859 
my stomach and I said I think we need to
take<00:00:19.140> off<00:00:19.350> at<00:00:19.740> our<00:00:20.130> halfway<00:00:20.340> point<00:00:20.689> and<00:00:21.689> that

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
take off at our halfway point and that

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:23.570 
take off at our halfway point and that
halfway<00:00:22.080> point<00:00:22.230> was<00:00:22.560> sort<00:00:22.769> of<00:00:22.830> the<00:00:22.980> last<00:00:23.250> spot

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:23.580 
halfway point was sort of the last spot

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.460 
halfway point was sort of the last spot
that<00:00:23.760> we<00:00:23.850> could<00:00:24.029> take<00:00:24.240> out<00:00:24.420> before<00:00:25.199> it<00:00:25.320> was

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:25.470 
that we could take out before it was

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.560 
that we could take out before it was
like<00:00:25.680> a<00:00:25.710> no<00:00:26.279> turning<00:00:26.670> around<00:00:26.730> situation

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
like a no turning around situation

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.300 
like a no turning around situation
before<00:00:28.349> we<00:00:28.439> delve<00:00:28.590> deeper<00:00:29.010> into<00:00:29.220> the

still very very much disconnected from

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:17.840 
still very very much disconnected from
the<00:01:15.119> world<00:01:15.590> so<00:01:16.590> we<00:01:17.009> did<00:01:17.159> end<00:01:17.280> up<00:01:17.400> making<00:01:17.549> it<00:01:17.790> to

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
the world so we did end up making it to

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:19.730 
the world so we did end up making it to
the<00:01:18.119> ocean<00:01:18.240> though<00:01:18.570> but<00:01:19.049> it<00:01:19.290> ended<00:01:19.500> up<00:01:19.530> being

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
the ocean though but it ended up being

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.280 
the ocean though but it ended up being
much<00:01:20.310> less<00:01:20.580> romantic<00:01:20.820> than<00:01:21.420> my<00:01:21.540> image<00:01:21.990> my

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
much less romantic than my image my

total<00:01:29.369> summit<00:01:29.729> moment<00:01:30.170> but<00:01:31.170> we<00:01:31.290> ended<00:01:31.439> up<00:01:31.560> just

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
total summit moment but we ended up just

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.700 
total summit moment but we ended up just
taking<00:01:32.340> a<00:01:32.490> ferry<00:01:32.850> we<00:01:33.810> were<00:01:34.140> able<00:01:34.229> to<00:01:34.409> find<00:01:34.619> a

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
taking a ferry we were able to find a

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.260 
taking a ferry we were able to find a
local<00:01:35.009> ferry<00:01:35.250> and<00:01:35.430> it<00:01:35.490> took<00:01:35.610> us<00:01:35.729> a<00:01:35.850> day<00:01:35.880> to<00:01:36.090> get

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:36.270 
local ferry and it took us a day to get

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.760 
local ferry and it took us a day to get
downstream<00:01:36.810> and<00:01:37.020> then<00:01:37.110> we<00:01:37.259> hitchhike<00:01:37.650> the

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
downstream and then we hitchhike the

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:38.530 
downstream and then we hitchhike the
rest<00:01:37.950> of<00:01:38.100> the<00:01:38.280> way

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:38.540 
rest of the way

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:41.030 
rest of the way
and<00:01:39.540> so<00:01:40.049> we<00:01:40.200> hitchhiked<00:01:40.530> the<00:01:40.590> rest<00:01:40.740> of<00:01:40.860> the<00:01:40.920> way

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
and so we hitchhiked the rest of the way

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.730 
and so we hitchhiked the rest of the way
and<00:01:41.280> we<00:01:41.369> ended<00:01:41.579> up<00:01:41.700> in<00:01:41.850> this<00:01:41.939> old<00:01:42.740> fishing

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:43.740 
and we ended up in this old fishing

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.350 
and we ended up in this old fishing
village<00:01:43.890> that<00:01:44.310> was<00:01:44.399> sort<00:01:44.579> of<00:01:44.610> falling<00:01:45.149> in<00:01:45.270> on

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:45.360 
village that was sort of falling in on

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.420 
village that was sort of falling in on
itself<00:01:45.420> and<00:01:46.079> we<00:01:46.470> quickly<00:01:46.680> realized<00:01:47.220> we<00:01:47.340> were

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:47.430 
itself and we quickly realized we were

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:50.030 
itself and we quickly realized we were
the<00:01:47.549> only<00:01:47.759> people<00:01:48.299> that<00:01:49.229> this<00:01:49.439> place<00:01:49.710> mattered

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:50.040 
the only people that this place mattered

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.609 
the only people that this place mattered
to<00:01:50.250> and<00:01:51.210> for<00:01:51.420> us<00:01:51.540> it<00:01:51.750> meant<00:01:51.899> something<00:01:52.170> very

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
to and for us it meant something very

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.260 
to and for us it meant something very
different<00:01:52.860> than<00:01:53.310> it<00:01:53.430> did<00:01:53.549> for<00:01:53.759> everybody<00:01:54.060> else

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:54.270 
different than it did for everybody else

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:56.179 
different than it did for everybody else
it<00:01:54.570> was<00:01:54.780> the<00:01:54.990> end<00:01:55.170> of<00:01:55.380> this<00:01:55.500> really<00:01:55.979> long

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:56.189 
it was the end of this really long

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:01.039 
it was the end of this really long
powerful<00:01:56.850> journey<00:01:57.090> and<00:01:58.079> and<00:01:59.090> the<00:02:00.090> end<00:02:00.240> of<00:02:00.630> a

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:01.049 
powerful journey and and the end of a

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:03.260 
powerful journey and and the end of a
dream<00:02:01.500> that<00:02:01.770> we<00:02:01.920> had<00:02:01.950> wanted<00:02:02.549> to<00:02:02.729> see<00:02:03.000> through

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
dream that we had wanted to see through

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:06.050 
dream that we had wanted to see through
and<00:02:03.899> this<00:02:04.890> is<00:02:05.070> the<00:02:05.159> image<00:02:05.280> of<00:02:05.430> us<00:02:05.610> leaving

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
and this is the image of us leaving

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:08.850 
and this is the image of us leaving

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
and you can see like it's a big big

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.270 
and you can see like it's a big big
river<00:02:12.730> and<00:02:13.380> basically<00:02:14.380> about<00:02:14.890> a<00:02:14.950> week<00:02:15.130> later

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.280 
river and basically about a week later

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:18.270 
river and basically about a week later
we<00:02:15.550> find<00:02:15.790> out<00:02:16.030> the<00:02:16.840> greatest<00:02:17.170> flood<00:02:17.380> and<00:02:17.620> 120

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
we find out the greatest flood and 120

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:20.220 
we find out the greatest flood and 120
years<00:02:18.490> actually<00:02:19.060> hit<00:02:19.330> the<00:02:19.450> region<00:02:19.600> when<00:02:20.170> they

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:20.230 
years actually hit the region when they

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.110 
years actually hit the region when they
showed<00:02:20.410> the<00:02:20.500> before<00:02:20.770> and<00:02:20.830> after<00:02:21.160> images<00:02:21.520> what

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:22.120 
showed the before and after images what

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.520 
showed the before and after images what
we<00:02:22.210> were<00:02:22.300> paddling<00:02:22.510> looked<00:02:22.840> like<00:02:22.930> a<00:02:22.960> creek<00:02:23.350> on

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
we were paddling looked like a creek on

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.500 
we were paddling looked like a creek on
a<00:02:23.560> map<00:02:23.800> and<00:02:24.010> you<00:02:24.400> know<00:02:24.550> now<00:02:24.760> this<00:02:25.030> thing's

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:25.510 
a map and you know now this thing's

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:27.630 
a map and you know now this thing's
pretty<00:02:25.720> big<00:02:25.930> because<00:02:26.710> there's<00:02:26.890> no<00:02:27.010> big

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
pretty big because there's no big

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:29.580 
pretty big because there's no big
mountains<00:02:28.060> really<00:02:28.270> arounds<00:02:28.600> quite<00:02:28.780> flat<00:02:29.080> it

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
mountains really arounds quite flat it

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.390 
mountains really arounds quite flat it
was<00:02:30.220> like<00:02:30.370> 50<00:02:30.880> kilometers<00:02:31.390> wide<00:02:31.600> and<00:02:32.250> that's<00:02:33.250> a

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:33.400 
was like 50 kilometers wide and that's a

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.280 
was like 50 kilometers wide and that's a
lot<00:02:33.580> of<00:02:33.700> water<00:02:34.090> to<00:02:34.240> be<00:02:34.330> moving<00:02:34.780> around<00:02:34.870> so

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.290 
lot of water to be moving around so

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.500 
lot of water to be moving around so
thankfully<00:02:36.040> Amber's<00:02:36.430> intuition<00:02:36.940> was<00:02:37.150> on

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:37.510 
thankfully Amber's intuition was on

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:41.340 
thankfully Amber's intuition was on
target<00:02:39.030> so<00:02:40.030> this<00:02:40.180> is<00:02:40.330> a<00:02:40.360> Karen<00:02:40.900> we<00:02:41.020> built<00:02:41.200> for

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350 
target so this is a Karen we built for

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:44.790 
target so this is a Karen we built for
Zack<00:02:41.650> over<00:02:42.220> the<00:02:42.460> onin<00:02:42.760> river<00:02:43.000> and<00:02:43.530> we<00:02:44.530> found<00:02:44.680> a

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:44.800 
Zack over the onin river and we found a

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.290 
Zack over the onin river and we found a
lot<00:02:44.950> of<00:02:45.070> little<00:02:45.250> ways<00:02:45.370> to<00:02:45.610> celebrate<00:02:45.820> him<00:02:46.180> as

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:46.300 
lot of little ways to celebrate him as

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.449 
lot of little ways to celebrate him as
we<00:02:46.420> went<00:02:46.600> he<00:02:46.959> was<00:02:47.080> such<00:02:47.440> a<00:02:47.470> vibrant<00:02:48.070> vibrant

00:02:48.449 --> 00:02:48.459 
we went he was such a vibrant vibrant

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:50.670 
we went he was such a vibrant vibrant
human<00:02:48.880> being<00:02:49.030> and<00:02:49.209> he<00:02:49.330> was<00:02:49.450> always<00:02:49.750> laughing

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:50.680 
human being and he was always laughing

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.710 
human being and he was always laughing
and<00:02:51.130> dancing<00:02:51.400> and<00:02:51.760> just<00:02:51.910> in<00:02:52.120> the<00:02:52.240> flow<00:02:52.420> of<00:02:52.570> his

00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:52.720 
and dancing and just in the flow of his

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.199 
and dancing and just in the flow of his
life<00:02:52.930> and<00:02:53.250> so<00:02:54.250> I<00:02:54.280> think<00:02:54.550> if<00:02:54.640> there's<00:02:54.820> anything

00:02:55.199 --> 00:02:55.209 
life and so I think if there's anything

00:02:55.209 --> 00:02:57.270 
life and so I think if there's anything
that<00:02:55.720> I've<00:02:56.140> learned<00:02:56.440> in<00:02:56.650> his<00:02:56.800> life<00:02:57.010> and<00:02:57.130> in<00:02:57.250> his

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:57.280 
that I've learned in his life and in his

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.460 
that I've learned in his life and in his
passing<00:02:57.700> it's<00:02:58.120> that<00:02:58.270> no<00:02:58.420> matter<00:02:58.540> how<00:02:58.959> hard

00:02:59.460 --> 00:02:59.470 
passing it's that no matter how hard

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:01.590 
passing it's that no matter how hard
what<00:03:00.130> we<00:03:00.250> face<00:03:00.459> in<00:03:00.700> our<00:03:00.790> life<00:03:01.030> is<00:03:01.270> no<00:03:01.480> matter

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:01.600 
what we face in our life is no matter

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.110 
what we face in our life is no matter
how<00:03:01.690> crazy<00:03:02.230> and<00:03:02.530> difficult<00:03:02.920> things<00:03:03.130> get<00:03:03.520> there

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
how crazy and difficult things get there

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.360 
how crazy and difficult things get there
is<00:03:04.240> always<00:03:04.720> something<00:03:05.590> for<00:03:05.860> us<00:03:06.010> to<00:03:06.160> celebrate

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:06.370 
is always something for us to celebrate

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:10.170 
is always something for us to celebrate
and<00:03:07.200> I<00:03:08.200> think<00:03:08.530> that's<00:03:08.709> what<00:03:09.100> we<00:03:09.610> really<00:03:09.970> tried

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:10.180 
and I think that's what we really tried

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:56.130 
and I think that's what we really tried
to<00:03:10.209> do<00:03:10.510> in<00:03:10.840> Mongolia<00:03:11.620> and<00:03:11.890> on<00:03:12.190> this<00:03:12.459> trip

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:56.140 

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:58.200
