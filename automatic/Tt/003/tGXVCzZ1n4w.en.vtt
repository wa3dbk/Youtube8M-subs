00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.529
 hello to all of fox that came this 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:09.059
 new dustin video and in this 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:11.700
 opportunity we are going to see how they can 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.020
 complete the fifth contract of the event 

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.690
 of the queen where we will have to 

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:17.520
 face salix who is a captain 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:19.199
 fallen and we will only be able to 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.699
 find on the moon then to be able 

00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.470
 find then obviously we have to 

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:25.140
 come to the moon and we will have to arrive 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.630
 until the location that is called anchor 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.400
 of light if you do not know how to get up 

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.769
 the location as they simply continue 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.200
 the route that I am taking and therefore 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:36.059
 here they will be able to arrive once 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.010
 arrive here as demonstrated by all 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:39.780
 other videos of the location of the 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.219
 other enemies simply because 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:44.430
 we have to wait a bit since 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:45.780
 this event is activated as if it were a 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.340
 crib sabers event 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.739
 we just have to wait a bit 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.930
 to be able to find or start 

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:53.399
 appear these enemies in case 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:55.649
 have not yet eliminated the others 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:57.269
 enemies that are on earth 

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.010
 and in venus down here in the description 

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:01.350
 of this video I'm going to show you or 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.699
 I will leave the links where they can 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.110
 find our enemies and then 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:05.820
 obviously how can they eliminate 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.860
 well then the only thing we have to 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.020
 do while these enemies arrive is 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.500
 wait a bit below the part of the 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.780
 left 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:14.490
 a message will appear that says that a 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.750
 herd of wolves is lurking that 

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.310
 it means that the 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.940
 enemies and we'll have to be 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.500
 earrings of some ships that appear in 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:25.170
 the map then we are simply going to 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.180
 look many times they appear very close 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:29.490
 other times they appear a little far away like this 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.869
 that we simply look for these ships and 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.000
 there begin to arrive the enemies are 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:35.070
 four waves of enemies but some 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.340
 sometimes be many more can be 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.869
 be like 5 or 6 waves of enemies the 

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:41.610
 first wave of enemies brings about 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:43.920
 gentlemen who bring this canyon the canyon 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.090
 of the burn and then simply bring two 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:47.190
 only 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.810
 for this round so what they 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.190
 we advise that you try to grab it 

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:51.869
 as soon as possible because all the 

00:01:50.190 --> 00:01:53.220
 people want to grab it I'm 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.869
 they just grab him and with that 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:56.970
 they try to eliminate the rest of the 

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:58.860
 enemies the second wave are enemies 

00:01:56.970 --> 00:02:00.869
 normal the third are enemies 

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:03.030
 invisible so be careful because 

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:06.240
 you do not notice too much and finally the 

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.590
 fourth wave brings the final boss but 

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.509
 as I tell you there may be more waves 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:10.890
 so in case there are more 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.050
 waves do not worry simply 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:16.080
 continue to eliminate until the arrival 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:17.100
 final boss of once they kill the boss 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.780
 final 

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:21.390
 only thing that is going to happen is that it's going to 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.460
 appear a message that appears below in 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:26.580
 the part on the left that says that 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:28.620
 they have an ether key this key d 

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.480
 used to find a chest that has to 

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.680
 it is usually around and 

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.110
 especially here on the moon is 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:36.420
 quite difficult since these keys 

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:38.850
 these chests appear very far from 

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:40.560
 where you kill the final enemy like this 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:44.310
 try to do it as a team so that 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:46.260
 when he arrives he arrives this is the 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:47.940
 time to grab the chest as it 

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.830
 go to different places and try 

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.300
 find it then the moment that 

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.540
 open this chest what they will be able to 

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:56.010
 receive is in blue creams or let's say 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.530
 how peculiar are they going to be able to 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.780
 find helium filaments and for 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.700
 last what would be synthetic recharge of 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.440
 heavy ammunition or special ammunition 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.720
 if they have any luck they will be able to 

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.820
 find in grams of legend and also 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.160
 what would be a new item called the 

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:12.990
 queen's treasure key keep that 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.300
 key because that will serve us when 

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:17.250
 tlc arrives from house of world and 

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:19.050
 when all the enemies complete or 

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:21.360
 kill all the enemies of the prison 

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:23.460
 of the elderly are going to be able to say that 

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.000
 get treasures or with using these 

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:25.860
 keys 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.420
 at the time of killing all these 

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:29.490
 enemies then try to save them 

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:31.800
 do not go to vote and simply because 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:33.090
 have in your inventory at the moment you 

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:35.550
 come the tlc they will be able to use 

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:37.590
 then this is the way to find 

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:40.140
 xavi c's the dog that at the low of queens 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:41.730
 so it came to the bastard and obviously 

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:43.290
 find the chests that can 

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.940
 obviously receive at the time of 

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:46.650
 remove it then I hope you have them 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:49.290

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.209
