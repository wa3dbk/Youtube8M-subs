00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:01.520 
look around here the nut comes through

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.299 
look around here the nut comes through
this<00:01:02.520> into<00:01:03.090> this<00:01:03.290> other<00:01:04.290> housing<00:01:04.860> here<00:01:05.129> and

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
this into this other housing here and

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:07.820 
this into this other housing here and
then<00:01:06.030> on<00:01:06.330> the<00:01:06.659> back<00:01:06.840> of<00:01:06.869> it<00:01:07.200> there's<00:01:07.680> a

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
then on the back of it there's a

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:12.230 
then on the back of it there's a
phillips<00:01:08.729> head<00:01:09.439> countersunk<00:01:10.880> screw<00:01:11.880> i<00:01:11.909> guess

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:12.240 
phillips head countersunk screw i guess

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.030 
phillips head countersunk screw i guess
you'd<00:01:12.420> call<00:01:12.450> it<00:01:12.659> and<00:01:12.930> then<00:01:15.470> so<00:01:16.470> that<00:01:16.500> holds<00:01:16.950> the

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
you'd call it and then so that holds the

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.330 
you'd call it and then so that holds the
carburetor<00:01:17.549> here<00:01:18.030> to<00:01:18.570> this<00:01:19.380> intermediate

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
carburetor here to this intermediate

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.330 
carburetor here to this intermediate
piece<00:01:20.670> which<00:01:21.240> then<00:01:21.509> bolts<00:01:22.229> to<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:22.439> engine

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:23.340 
piece which then bolts to the engine

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:31.130 
piece which then bolts to the engine
with<00:01:24.200> two<00:01:25.200> more<00:01:27.890> phillips<00:01:28.890> head<00:01:29.070> screws<00:01:29.939> now<00:01:30.810> i

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
with two more phillips head screws now i

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.600 
with two more phillips head screws now i
can't<00:01:32.420> get<00:01:33.420> those<00:01:33.600> screws<00:01:34.020> out<00:01:34.430> the<00:01:35.430> one

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
screw

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:04.130 
screw
everything's<00:01:59.930> phillips<00:02:00.930> head<00:02:01.409> so<00:02:03.140> my

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
everything's phillips head so my

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.569 
everything's phillips head so my
experience<00:02:04.710> that<00:02:04.860> you<00:02:04.979> need<00:02:05.130> an<00:02:05.219> impact

00:02:05.569 --> 00:02:05.579 
experience that you need an impact

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:08.359 
experience that you need an impact
driver<00:02:05.759> and<00:02:06.240> this<00:02:06.990> thing's<00:02:07.320> designed<00:02:07.710> so<00:02:08.220> that

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
driver and this thing's designed so that

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.190 
driver and this thing's designed so that
even<00:02:08.520> an<00:02:08.700> impact<00:02:09.060> driver<00:02:09.360> won't<00:02:09.599> work

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
even an impact driver won't work

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.230 
even an impact driver won't work
so<00:02:11.069> i

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240 
so i

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.570 
so i
I<00:02:12.330> fully<00:02:13.200> intend<00:02:13.710> to<00:02:13.860> get<00:02:13.980> this<00:02:14.190> carburetor

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:14.580 
I fully intend to get this carburetor

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.690 
I fully intend to get this carburetor

going to do it at the moment
so<00:02:19.800> like<00:02:20.370> I<00:02:20.490> say<00:02:20.670> this<00:02:20.940> is<00:02:21.150> like<00:02:21.330> the<00:02:21.900> worst

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:22.200 
so like I say this is like the worst

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.890 
so like I say this is like the worst
designed<00:02:22.880> carburetor<00:02:23.880> attachment<00:02:24.540> I've<00:02:24.630> ever

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:24.900 
designed carburetor attachment I've ever

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.720 
designed carburetor attachment I've ever
seen<00:02:25.820> the<00:02:26.820> engine<00:02:27.150> itself<00:02:27.450> ran<00:02:27.750> well<00:02:28.280> I'm<00:02:29.280> sure

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
seen the engine itself ran well I'm sure

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.370 
seen the engine itself ran well I'm sure
that<00:02:29.970> new<00:02:30.210> Tecumseh's<00:02:30.810> are<00:02:30.960> different<00:02:31.320> I

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:31.380 
that new Tecumseh's are different I

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:33.770 
that new Tecumseh's are different I
believe<00:02:31.410> the<00:02:31.770> carburetor<00:02:32.250> is<00:02:32.570> on<00:02:33.570> the

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:33.780 
believe the carburetor is on the

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.630 
believe the carburetor is on the
opposite<00:02:34.140> site<00:02:34.380> perhaps<00:02:34.980> where<00:02:35.190> the<00:02:35.340> exhaust

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:35.640 
opposite site perhaps where the exhaust

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.180 
opposite site perhaps where the exhaust
is<00:02:35.880> on<00:02:36.090> this<00:02:36.240> one<00:02:36.620> I've<00:02:37.620> seen<00:02:37.800> something<00:02:38.160> like

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:38.190 
is on this one I've seen something like

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:39.920 
is on this one I've seen something like
that<00:02:38.280> at<00:02:38.610> least<00:02:38.820> but<00:02:39.390> I<00:02:39.480> can<00:02:39.630> certainly

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
that at least but I can certainly

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.620 
that at least but I can certainly
understand<00:02:40.440> why<00:02:40.560> they<00:02:40.800> got<00:02:40.950> rid<00:02:41.130> of<00:02:41.280> this

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:41.630 
understand why they got rid of this

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:47.270 
understand why they got rid of this
setup<00:02:43.190> it'd<00:02:44.190> be<00:02:44.520> fine<00:02:44.790> if<00:02:45.170> the<00:02:46.170> the<00:02:46.800> bolt<00:02:47.070> in

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:47.280 
setup it'd be fine if the the bolt in

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.670 
setup it'd be fine if the the bolt in
this<00:02:47.490> the<00:02:48.450> countersunk<00:02:48.960> bolt<00:02:49.290> in<00:02:49.500> there

00:02:49.670 --> 00:02:49.680 
this the countersunk bolt in there

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.400 
this the countersunk bolt in there
wouldn't<00:02:50.070> start<00:02:50.340> to<00:02:50.520> spin<00:02:50.820> when<00:02:51.630> you<00:02:51.810> try<00:02:52.380> to

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
wouldn't start to spin when you try to

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:53.990 
wouldn't start to spin when you try to
take<00:02:52.620> the<00:02:52.740> nut<00:02:52.920> off<00:02:52.950> that's<00:02:53.550> what's<00:02:53.790> causing

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:54.000 
take the nut off that's what's causing

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.150 
take the nut off that's what's causing
the<00:02:54.210> whole<00:02:54.300> problem<00:02:54.710> so<00:02:56.000> anyway<00:02:57.000> I'll<00:02:57.390> be

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:58.160 
the whole problem so anyway I'll be

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.650 
the whole problem so anyway I'll be
sticking<00:02:59.160> with<00:02:59.340> Briggs<00:02:59.730> &amp;<00:02:59.940> Stratton<00:02:59.970> that's

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:00.660 
sticking with Briggs &amp; Stratton that's

00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:06.380 
sticking with Briggs &amp; Stratton that's
for<00:03:00.870> sure<00:03:01.130> we'll<00:03:02.630> catch<00:03:03.630> you<00:03:03.810> later<00:03:03.840> then
