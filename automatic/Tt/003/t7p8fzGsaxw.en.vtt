00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:07.140 
6000 oh it really stands out is that it

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.950 
6000 oh it really stands out is that it
now<00:01:07.290> has<00:01:07.320> Thunderbolt<00:01:08.159> 2<00:01:08.360> connectivity<00:01:09.360> to

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.080 
with bandwidths twice the speed may hit

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.390 
with bandwidths twice the speed may hit
20<00:01:13.860> gigabytes<00:01:14.369> per<00:01:15.030> second<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:16.680> changes<00:01:17.220> in

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:17.400 
20 gigabytes per second the changes in

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.850 
20 gigabytes per second the changes in
the<00:01:17.490> device<00:01:18.210> from<00:01:18.509> last<00:01:18.810> year's<00:01:19.140> version<00:01:19.439> are

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
the device from last year's version are

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.149 
the device from last year's version are
not<00:01:20.189> that<00:01:20.490> very<00:01:20.820> big<00:01:21.240> as<00:01:21.450> i<00:01:21.840> said<00:01:22.170> before<00:01:22.350> but

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
not that very big as i said before but

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:25.670 
not that very big as i said before but
here<00:01:23.369> are<00:01:23.490> the<00:01:23.549> few<00:01:23.909> highlights<00:01:24.320> first<00:01:25.320> of<00:01:25.530> all

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
here are the few highlights first of all

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:28.490 
here are the few highlights first of all
it<00:01:25.979> has<00:01:26.340> Thunderbolt<00:01:27.060> 2<00:01:27.270> which<00:01:27.990> is<00:01:28.170> awesome

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500 
it has Thunderbolt 2 which is awesome

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.499 
it has Thunderbolt 2 which is awesome
because<00:01:28.860> we've<00:01:29.130> never<00:01:29.400> seen<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:30.030> second

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
because we've never seen the second

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.109 
because we've never seen the second
generation<00:01:30.720> of<00:01:31.320> Thunderbolt<00:01:31.890> and<00:01:32.220> it<00:01:32.970> also

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
generation of Thunderbolt and it also

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:35.179 
generation of Thunderbolt and it also
has<00:01:33.270> a<00:01:33.420> really<00:01:33.900> long<00:01:34.200> battery<00:01:34.530> life<00:01:34.740> about

00:01:35.179 --> 00:01:35.189 
has a really long battery life about

00:01:35.189 --> 00:01:40.609 
has a really long battery life about
about<00:01:35.700> 10<00:01:36.540> hours<00:01:37.079> it's<00:01:37.860> like<00:01:37.979> awesome<00:01:39.619> also

00:01:40.609 --> 00:01:40.619 
about 10 hours it's like awesome also

00:01:40.619 --> 00:01:43.789 
about 10 hours it's like awesome also
the<00:01:41.430> minimal<00:01:42.000> changes<00:01:42.420> is<00:01:42.600> that<00:01:42.630> obviously<00:01:43.590> as

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
the minimal changes is that obviously as

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.700 
the minimal changes is that obviously as
I<00:01:43.920> said<00:01:44.159> before<00:01:44.270> the<00:01:45.270> graphics<00:01:45.899> are<00:01:46.110> a<00:01:46.140> little

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
I said before the graphics are a little

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.550 
I said before the graphics are a little
better<00:01:47.040> and<00:01:47.369> the<00:01:47.820> process<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.659> memory<00:01:49.290> is<00:01:49.500> a

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
better and the process the memory is a

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.020 
better and the process the memory is a
little<00:01:49.860> faster<00:01:50.640> as<00:01:50.790> well<00:01:51.299> and<00:01:52.399> I<00:01:53.399> really<00:01:53.430> do

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
little faster as well and I really do

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.990 
little faster as well and I really do
think<00:01:54.329> I<00:01:54.689> do<00:01:54.990> need<00:01:55.470> more<00:01:55.680> testing<00:01:56.340> but<00:01:56.520> it

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:57.000 
think I do need more testing but it

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.600 
think I do need more testing but it
looks<00:01:57.240> like<00:01:57.360> Apple<00:01:57.780> did<00:01:58.320> good<00:01:58.560> on<00:01:58.799> this<00:01:58.860> device

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
looks like Apple did good on this device

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.350 
looks like Apple did good on this device
as<00:02:00.170> you<00:02:01.170> can<00:02:01.320> see<00:02:01.619> here<00:02:02.219> the<00:02:02.670> geekbench<00:02:03.210> score

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
as you can see here the geekbench score

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.959 
as you can see here the geekbench score
is<00:02:03.719> from<00:02:04.110> comparing<00:02:04.680> to<00:02:04.799> last<00:02:04.829> year<00:02:05.460> have<00:02:05.939> not

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
is from comparing to last year have not

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:09.199 
is from comparing to last year have not
changed<00:02:06.509> that<00:02:06.930> much<00:02:07.009> with<00:02:08.009> for<00:02:08.369> a<00:02:08.399> single<00:02:08.970> core

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
changed that much with for a single core

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.530 
changed that much with for a single core
it<00:02:09.479> it<00:02:10.440> went<00:02:10.619> from<00:02:11.450> 2,750

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:12.540 
it it went from 2,750

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:18.580 
it it went from 2,750
32<00:02:14.239> 2883<00:02:15.239> and<00:02:15.780> with<00:02:16.349> multi-core<00:02:17.069> it<00:02:17.489> went<00:02:17.700> from

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:18.590 
32 2883 and with multi-core it went from

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:25.130 
32 2883 and with multi-core it went from
5486<00:02:19.590> to<00:02:21.620> 5762<00:02:22.620> so<00:02:23.340> as<00:02:23.549> I<00:02:23.819> was<00:02:23.849> saying<00:02:24.180> the

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:25.140 
5486 to 5762 so as I was saying the

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:28.789 
5486 to 5762 so as I was saying the
changes<00:02:26.010> are<00:02:26.189> not<00:02:26.430> that<00:02:26.760> big<00:02:27.060> at<00:02:27.329> all<00:02:27.659> so<00:02:28.349> here

00:02:28.789 --> 00:02:28.799 
changes are not that big at all so here

00:02:28.799 --> 00:02:31.699 
changes are not that big at all so here
are<00:02:29.010> the<00:02:29.040> pros<00:02:29.549> and<00:02:29.579> cons<00:02:30.060> as<00:02:30.480> usual<00:02:31.409> let's

00:02:31.699 --> 00:02:31.709 
are the pros and cons as usual let's

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:33.860

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
comes out and always satisfies like

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.879 
comes out and always satisfies like
Apple<00:02:44.069> always<00:02:44.609> does<00:02:44.909> and<00:02:45.299> the<00:02:46.049> cons<00:02:46.319> is<00:02:46.680> that
