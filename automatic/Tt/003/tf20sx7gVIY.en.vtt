00:00:00.589 --> 00:00:06.960
 we went and decided how so about it 

00:00:03.389 --> 00:00:08.700
 sugar and why sugar because it is in 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:11.519
 many products is nothing wrong in itself 

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.110
 what is in so much that we often have to 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:14.849
 much sugar get inside 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:17.730
 that's not good for us 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.410
 We have a high blood sugar fall and 

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.939
 if you want to perform or if you want 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.619
 somewhere the fifteen hundred meters 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.869
 skating or something that is nothing wrong with it 

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:26.760
 wanted you have a little energy but if 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:29.099
 your deal goes your body's route 

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.410
 lowering blood sugar holds back 

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:32.579
 then all energy from your body then 

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.620
 being your mother you get less 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:36.290
 resistance etcetera etcetera etcetera 

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:39.390
 so I'm going to talk about a few 

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:41.670
 products on the market and what 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.010
 by frank we want nothing to know what 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:45.930
 contains a lot of sugar 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:48.360
 how much sugar was in the bay 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:50.039
 and the deposit angle this angle five hundred 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.309
 and fifty grams 

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:56.489
 xl ranges for a moment you bet 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:57.390
 closing is also saying because there is in 100 

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.280
 grams 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:03.420
 I have always seen on the packaging 

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:08.909
 looking at the package is 40 what was it 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:13.229
 40 40 grams yes to 100 grams 

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:15.390
 4 anyway that's 10 sugar cubes per 100 

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:19.650
 grams, therefore, five hundred and fifty grams 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:23.119
 xl so that is 5.5 

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:23.119
 times 10 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.970
 that becomes 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:35.750
 55 lumps of sugar are in one 

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:39.890
 pijnenburg corner so we continued with 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:42.020
 pijnenburg cook those holes in the CO 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:44.479
 Well when they watch it must be a moment 

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:46.159
 responsible separation 

00:01:44.479 --> 00:01:49.540
 there is also two months I am curious 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:49.540
 or is not a little googled 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:53.119
 Look, that is again the advantage of the whole 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.090
 lots of sugar it makes it all 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:02:00.310
 wood water he soon a 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:05.000
 advantage of course he is still leaving o 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:07.729
 th ' green-gray 

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.660
 pijnenburg cake 55 butts it is 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:11.350
