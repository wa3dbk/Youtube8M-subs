and<00:00:53.219> I<00:00:53.370> know<00:00:53.550> I<00:00:54.000> think<00:00:54.480> getting<00:00:54.930> off<00:00:55.140> a<00:00:55.170> good

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:55.440 
and I know I think getting off a good

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.290 
and I know I think getting off a good
first<00:00:55.680> punt<00:00:55.980> kind<00:00:56.340> of<00:00:56.430> helped<00:00:56.640> a<00:00:56.789> little<00:00:57.090> bit

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
first punt kind of helped a little bit

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.360 
first punt kind of helped a little bit
too<00:00:57.539> and<00:00:57.809> I<00:00:58.020> just<00:00:58.440> tried<00:00:58.559> not<00:00:58.770> to<00:00:58.920> do<00:00:59.039> too<00:00:59.070> much

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
too and I just tried not to do too much

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.189 
too and I just tried not to do too much
and<00:00:59.579> it<00:00:59.699> was<00:00:59.820> good<00:01:00.030> enough<00:01:00.239> to<00:01:00.300> win<00:01:00.570> but<00:01:00.989> it's

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
and it was good enough to win but it's

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:05.539 
and it was good enough to win but it's
not<00:01:01.379> only<00:01:01.590> getting<00:01:01.770> up<00:01:01.949> 14<00:01:03.589> I<00:01:04.589> have<00:01:05.339> one<00:01:05.460> of

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
not only getting up 14 I have one of

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.399 
not only getting up 14 I have one of
those<00:01:05.640> killings<00:01:05.880> myself<00:01:06.390> so<00:01:06.630> I<00:01:06.900> got<00:01:07.229> to<00:01:07.350> go

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:07.409 
those killings myself so I got to go

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:09.830 
those killings myself so I got to go
back<00:01:07.590> in<00:01:07.860> and<00:01:08.430> eliminate<00:01:08.909> bad<00:01:09.090> football<00:01:09.390> and

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:09.840
