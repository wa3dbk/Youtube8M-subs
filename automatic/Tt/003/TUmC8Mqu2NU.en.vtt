00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.390
 everybody 

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:12.320
 hi to all his friends cms blake masters 

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:14.570
 years old then today we find ourselves 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.099
 during challenge and number 10 then 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:18.920
 as first finish I had you 

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:21.349
 gave the chili challenge so the chilli 

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:24.199
 I had to eat a red pepper so 

00:00:21.349 --> 00:00:25.850
 level iv quickly quite full-bodied I have 

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:28.400
 say anyway so this time for 

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:31.189
 my challenge number 10 I'm trying to achieve 

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.540
 a challenge to his explosives so I laugh 

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:34.280
 like a lot of trouble with my young 

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:35.690
 since since I'm going to eat 

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.550
 the strongest equipment in the world 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:39.080
 so it's habanero peppers or 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.120
 whole as you can see here 

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:43.250
 I have a dozen so not what he 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:44.450
 must buy them back by 100 grams 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:46.190
 is only found in the market in belgium 

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:47.750
 so we can not rush in 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:50.149
 large areas then in the chilli 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:52.010
 number 4 quickly to inform you 

00:00:50.149 --> 00:00:54.559
 so I had on the scale of scoville 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:57.829
 said it was a fairly hot pepper 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:01:00.260
 and it is appropriate between 2500 and 3500 rates 

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:01.670
 of capesize and capsaicin in hinny 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:05.149
 the huge one that constitutes an argument already 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:08.360
 strong enough then the spice here so 

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:10.789
 habanero is between 100,000 and 

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.110
 350 miles all of Capsaicin's 

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:13.729
 peppers so that when you 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:16.039
 keep a straighter count at 

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:16.459
 world and one and lucky man the strongest of 

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:19.490
 Belgium 

00:01:16.459 --> 00:01:22.550
 so here you go so I took milk 

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:25.009
 to calm the dose and we have loaves 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:27.349
 of bread because it's going to be minimum 24 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:29.259

00:01:27.349 --> 00:01:31.970
