00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:17.490
 I welcome you fixes and today I 

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:20.730
 would like to pay attention once again 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:23.040
 important point here in the update 53 years 

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:25.680
 There have been significant changes in the format 

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:27.810
 The macro essence of this video is to 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.970
 tom to expand the understanding of ordinary 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:32.520
 user model is about what is 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.410
 presents a new macro format to 

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.239
 with manual editing you had 

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:38.250
 what parameters 

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.030
 set and what can be further 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.010
 tune 

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:43.649
 if you want to understand more 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.630
 seriously welcome to the karen forum 

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:49.050
 random more useful information 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:51.059
 can be gleaned from wikipedia important 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.360
 understand that this is not just a change 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.710
 appearance macro is a kind 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:57.870
 constructor now we can 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.850
 format them according to our 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:02.760
 Preferences of which you can not do before 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.350
 it was for example now you can limit 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:07.170
 the length of the nickname is strictly specified number 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:07.950
 characters or winning percentage before 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.750
 integer 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.729
 now you can make it fractional 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.940
 desired number of characters after 

00:01:11.729 --> 00:01:18.090
 comma that is a new macro format 

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:19.350
 this extension allows more flexibility 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.500
 customize what is displayed 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.119
 information such a macro option 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.310
 suggests the author of the script for 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:26.729
 automatically transfer them to a new one 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.490
 format 

00:01:26.729 --> 00:01:31.799
 I repeat that with update 53 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.850
 you can compose macros huge 

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:35.130
 number of options 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.619
 and this is as close as possible to the old 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:39.869
 for those people that I want something 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:42.320
 change and for starters they just want 

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:44.790
 so that their figs he worked as before 

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.830
 changing macros to a new format is very 

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.140
 preferably as the old version may 

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:50.909
 incorrect work so the easiest 

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.460
 will use the translation script 

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:55.470
 and if you want to apply new 

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.689
 chips who can help with advice 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:01.110
 refer to the korean random forum threads to 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:02.970
 active users of mod these 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.560
 the parameters also did not significantly change 

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:07.650
 their appearance 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.420
 corrects the script and from the player gray 

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:11.760
 as you have noticed in most 

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:15.000
 cases of the old macro added 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:17.490
 some text formation parameters 

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:20.640
 happens on this kind of used 

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:23.010
 format close to print effect is important 

00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:25.410
 follow the syntax every character has 

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:27.660
 value so read carefully 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:28.880
 structure before adding something 

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:32.970
 or change 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:35.910
 name name of macro normalization 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:38.730
 values like minus for alignment 

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:41.970
 left if there is no alignment 

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:44.400
 to the right 0 to add numbers leading 

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:47.580
 zeros to a given length vitz 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:49.890
 minimum width further maximum 

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:51.480
 line width or number of characters 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:53.940
 decimal for numbers 

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:56.010
 next type of output element 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.610
 set depending on the required 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:01.080
 conditions 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:04.590
 most commonly used with 40 d 

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:07.170
 integer and huge number other types 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.750
 can be viewed on the Wikipedia website 

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:11.790
 I will leave the link in the description 

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:14.700
 suffix added at the end for example 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.739
 if a long moment of substitution is cut off and 

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:19.170
 the value is returned instead of the usual 

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:20.880
 if it is present this parameter 

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.690
 more needed for experienced 

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.720
 users 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:26.670
 df defaults which 

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:30.060
 substituted when no value 

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:32.459
 for example, when there is no statistics 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.070
 characters that you will be displayed 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:36.989
 specified in the config file 

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:38.910
 First, consider a couple of examples. 

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:41.820
 efficiency take the most 

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:44.519
 popular rating vn8 first with us 

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:47.459
 two digit two digit four digit 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:48.810
 word for ratings which displays 

00:03:47.459 --> 00:03:52.110
 two character value 

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:55.320
 put x if you need 4 characters 

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:57.900
 remove x ismo ends let's decipher 

00:03:55.320 --> 00:04:01.350
 what will be displayed in this line 

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:03.930
 vn8 this rating is a percent sign 

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:06.510
 means the beginning of the description of the formation 

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:09.000
 data type and must be placed before 

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:10.860
 the output flag sees them or type 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.480
 and if none of these parameters 

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:16.660
 It uses the percentage is not put 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:19.180
 4d field width four characters and 

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:21.970
 a decimal digit is output with 

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:24.550
 alignment to the right and if it were 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:25.150
 then the output would be alignment 

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:28.780
 to the left 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:32.290
 there is only two analogous width fields 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:33.910
 two characters and with string type since 

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:37.870
 at the maximum rating value 

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:39.610
 the xvm scale displays the characters x x when 

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:42.160
 no data will be such a value 

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:45.190
 here you can put your option 

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:48.039
 which you like is possible 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:50.500
 such a thing will be interesting so we'll see 

00:04:48.039 --> 00:04:52.289
 fractional value of winning percentage with one 

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:55.930
 characters after comma 

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:58.030
 four is the width of this one field after 

00:04:55.930 --> 00:05:00.850
 comma and 0 set to align 

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:03.880
 to display information was one 

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:06.520
 size for example if there was a percentage 

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:07.990
 exactly 60 wins would be small 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:10.900
 displacement accordingly slightly 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:14.830
 ugly and a couple more examples with 

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:17.020
 macro name with this option . sixteen 

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:17.500
 this is the maximum length of some 16 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:20.710
 characters 

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:21.550
 all that more will be cut off the tilde and 

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:23.740
 : 

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:25.710
 in this case, the truncated characters will be 

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:28.860
 replaced by dots 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:32.860
 here minus denotes left alignment 

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:36.789
 10 of the glacier is short then supplemented by 

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:40.450
 10 characters. 10 if the nickname is longer 

00:05:36.789 --> 00:05:43.030
 ten then the excess is cut off at the same time 

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:45.460
 if the minimum width is greater than or equal to 

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:49.300
 the maximum width of the sling suffix 

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:52.270
 not used one more example minus 

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:56.020
 left alignment minimum length 20 

00:05:52.270 --> 00:05:56.620
 maximum 25 all that is more than 25 

00:05:56.020 --> 00:06:00.280
 characters 

00:05:56.620 --> 00:06:03.130
 will be replaced by pull by the way 

00:06:00.280 --> 00:06:05.620
 now to output the percent character not 

00:06:03.130 --> 00:06:07.560
 need to use unique as before 

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:10.150
 in case of questions 

00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:13.150
 associated with the new macro format 

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:15.190
 visit the karen rand forum link 

00:06:13.150 --> 00:06:18.550
 on this topic I will leave in the description of the video 

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:20.530
 and the conclusion once again wanted to mention 

00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:22.150
 that script is very convenient to use 

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:24.610
 transfer of macros to the new format 

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:25.870
 since ghostly editing is possible 

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:28.270
 make a bunch of mistakes 

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:32.280
 Yes, and takes time decently for 

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:32.280
 today I have everything to new meetings
