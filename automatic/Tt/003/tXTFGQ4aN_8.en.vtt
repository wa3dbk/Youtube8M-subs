00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:42.710 
first speed tie and he faked out while I

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:44.740 
first speed tie and he faked out while I
faked<00:00:43.070> out<00:00:43.280> and<00:00:43.580> of<00:00:43.910> course<00:00:44.090> he<00:00:44.180> hits<00:00:44.269> me<00:00:44.420> and

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:44.750 
faked out and of course he hits me and

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:46.119 
faked out and of course he hits me and
then<00:00:44.960> I<00:00:45.050> used<00:00:45.290> switcheroo<00:00:45.620> to<00:00:45.769> give<00:00:45.920> him<00:00:46.040> a

00:00:46.119 --> 00:00:46.129

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:48.460 
then I used switcheroo to give him a
lagging<00:00:46.400> tail<00:00:46.760> but<00:00:47.090> that<00:00:47.600> does<00:00:47.900> bugger<00:00:48.320> all

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:48.470 
lagging tail but that does bugger all

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:50.799 
lagging tail but that does bugger all
because<00:00:48.920> he's<00:00:49.790> able<00:00:49.940> to<00:00:50.149> hit<00:00:50.300> me<00:00:50.390> with<00:00:50.480> bite

00:00:50.799 --> 00:00:50.809 
because he's able to hit me with bite

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:52.479 
because he's able to hit me with bite
and<00:00:51.170> does<00:00:51.320> all<00:00:51.500> quite<00:00:51.800> a<00:00:51.829> lot<00:00:51.980> of<00:00:52.040> damage<00:00:52.190> and

with under punch since the only

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:57.160 
with under punch since the only
attacking<00:00:55.879> move<00:00:56.090> that<00:00:56.239> I<00:00:56.300> have<00:00:56.480> besides<00:00:56.930> faked

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.170 
attacking move that I have besides faked

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.220 
attacking move that I have besides faked
out<00:00:57.350> and<00:00:58.000> it's<00:00:59.000> not<00:00:59.120> going<00:00:59.239> to<00:00:59.329> do<00:00:59.390> much<00:00:59.510> to<00:00:59.809> me

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:00.230 
out and it's not going to do much to me

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.310 
out and it's not going to do much to me
Alf<00:01:00.379> who<00:01:00.590> bites<00:01:00.860> me<00:01:01.070> to<00:01:01.219> kill<00:01:01.579> me<00:01:01.730> off<00:01:02.320> so

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:03.320 
Alf who bites me to kill me off so

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.400 
Alf who bites me to kill me off so
already<00:01:03.350> off<00:01:03.710> to<00:01:03.739> a<00:01:03.890> very<00:01:03.950> bad<00:01:04.129> start<00:01:04.550> and<00:01:05.410> as

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:06.410 
already off to a very bad start and as

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:07.990 
already off to a very bad start and as
you<00:01:06.619> can<00:01:06.740> see<00:01:06.770> things<00:01:07.340> aren't<00:01:07.640> going<00:01:07.850> to<00:01:07.910> go

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.000 
you can see things aren't going to go

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.670 
you can see things aren't going to go
much<00:01:08.149> better<00:01:08.360> so<00:01:08.780> I<00:01:08.840> go<00:01:08.990> out<00:01:09.080> to<00:01:09.140> statistical

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:09.680 
much better so I go out to statistical

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.620 
much better so I go out to statistical
because<00:01:10.220> I<00:01:10.369> know<00:01:10.430> I<00:01:10.520> can<00:01:10.759> kill<00:01:11.119> off<00:01:11.240> this<00:01:11.420> thing

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:11.630 
because I know I can kill off this thing

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.340 
because I know I can kill off this thing
and<00:01:11.899> I<00:01:11.930> just<00:01:12.080> like<00:01:12.289> go<00:01:12.500> sludge<00:01:12.950> bomb<00:01:13.509> and<00:01:14.509> then

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:15.350 
and I just like go sludge bomb and then

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:17.770 
and I just like go sludge bomb and then
sludge<00:01:15.770> face<00:01:16.100> becomes<00:01:16.460> the<00:01:16.789> mouth<00:01:17.270> and<00:01:17.690> then

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:17.780 
sludge face becomes the mouth and then

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:19.420 
sludge face becomes the mouth and then
me<00:01:17.960> off<00:01:18.080> dies<00:01:18.350> because<00:01:18.740> I<00:01:19.220> don't<00:01:19.399> think

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:19.430 
me off dies because I don't think

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:23.830 
me off dies because I don't think
slipspace<00:01:19.789> exists<00:01:20.210> anymore<00:01:20.390> does<00:01:20.780> he<00:01:22.119> so<00:01:23.119> now

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:23.840 
slipspace exists anymore does he so now

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.399 
slipspace exists anymore does he so now

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:32.030 
Thunderbolts and I was thinking I don't

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.300 
Thunderbolts and I was thinking I don't
know<00:01:32.090> why<00:01:32.450> that<00:01:32.869> I<00:01:33.229> could<00:01:33.470> live<00:01:33.710> this<00:01:33.950> but

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:34.310 
know why that I could live this but

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:35.890 
know why that I could live this but
obviously<00:01:34.549> I<00:01:34.909> can't<00:01:35.270> because<00:01:35.630> I'm<00:01:35.750> just

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:35.900 
obviously I can't because I'm just

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:40.330 
obviously I can't because I'm just
tentacle

00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:40.340

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.540 
overheat and now I start making the more
bad<00:01:58.440> plays<00:01:58.770> that<00:01:59.040> ended<00:01:59.340> up<00:01:59.460> costing<00:01:59.670> me<00:02:00.030> a<00:02:00.060> lot

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:01.550 
bad plays that ended up costing me a lot

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:05.450 
bad plays that ended up costing me a lot
so<00:02:02.550> now<00:02:02.820> he<00:02:02.880> goes<00:02:03.150> out<00:02:03.330> to<00:02:03.540> star<00:02:03.810> you<00:02:04.050> and<00:02:04.530> I

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.460 
so now he goes out to star you and I

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.460 
so now he goes out to star you and I
figure<00:02:05.820> okay<00:02:06.120> I<00:02:06.450> can't<00:02:06.900> really<00:02:07.050> do<00:02:07.260> anything

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 
figure okay I can't really do anything

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:08.719 
figure okay I can't really do anything
else<00:02:07.710> cuz<00:02:07.860> nothing<00:02:07.980> can<00:02:08.220> take<00:02:08.340> a<00:02:08.369> hit<00:02:08.520> in<00:02:08.640> this

00:02:08.719 --> 00:02:08.729 
else cuz nothing can take a hit in this

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.219 
else cuz nothing can take a hit in this
thing<00:02:08.940> really<00:02:09.149> so<00:02:09.450> I<00:02:09.479> decided<00:02:09.780> to<00:02:09.840> stay<00:02:10.050> and

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:10.229 
thing really so I decided to stay and

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.540 
thing really so I decided to stay and
just<00:02:10.380> go<00:02:10.530> for<00:02:10.649> an<00:02:10.740> overheat<00:02:11.100> and<00:02:11.190> sandwich

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
just go for an overheat and sandwich

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:13.910 
just go for an overheat and sandwich
it'll<00:02:11.760> do<00:02:12.030> but<00:02:12.510> this<00:02:12.840> isn't<00:02:12.990> up<00:02:13.200> being<00:02:13.440> quite<00:02:13.740> a

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:13.920 
it'll do but this isn't up being quite a

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.460 
it'll do but this isn't up being quite a
stupid<00:02:14.700> play<00:02:14.880> on<00:02:15.000> my<00:02:15.150> part<00:02:15.420> what<00:02:16.110> I<00:02:16.140> should

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:16.470 
stupid play on my part what I should

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:17.840 
stupid play on my part what I should
have<00:02:16.500> done<00:02:16.590> was<00:02:16.800> going<00:02:17.040> to<00:02:17.100> gasoline<00:02:17.400> let<00:02:17.760> it

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
have done was going to gasoline let it

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:20.780 
have done was going to gasoline let it
die<00:02:18.090> for<00:02:18.570> fodder<00:02:18.750> and<00:02:19.050> then<00:02:19.440> go<00:02:19.650> out<00:02:19.830> to<00:02:19.860> my<00:02:20.370> 020

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
die for fodder and then go out to my 020

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.090 
die for fodder and then go out to my 020
use<00:02:21.209> quick<00:02:21.390> attack<00:02:21.420> and<00:02:21.870> that<00:02:22.709> probably<00:02:22.920> would

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:23.100 
use quick attack and that probably would

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.040 
use quick attack and that probably would
have<00:02:23.160> killed<00:02:23.220> it<00:02:23.550> if<00:02:23.730> not<00:02:24.209> then<00:02:24.540> reeled<00:02:24.900> it

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
have killed it if not then reeled it

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.910 
have killed it if not then reeled it
would<00:02:25.140> have<00:02:25.230> been<00:02:25.290> able<00:02:25.440> to<00:02:25.530> kill<00:02:25.709> it<00:02:25.740> with

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
would have been able to kill it with

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.720 
would have been able to kill it with
quick<00:02:26.250> attack<00:02:26.280> and<00:02:26.700> then<00:02:27.450> if<00:02:27.870> I<00:02:28.080> still<00:02:28.320> had<00:02:28.350> my

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:28.730 
quick attack and then if I still had my

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:31.430 
quick attack and then if I still had my
Charmander<00:02:29.730> I<00:02:29.760> could<00:02:30.120> kill<00:02:30.540> off<00:02:30.690> his<00:02:30.870> gligar

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:31.440 
Charmander I could kill off his gligar

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.980 
Charmander I could kill off his gligar
and<00:02:32.000> I'm<00:02:33.000> not<00:02:33.120> exactly<00:02:33.300> sure<00:02:33.510> how<00:02:33.810> I<00:02:33.840> would

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:33.990 
and I'm not exactly sure how I would

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:35.510 
and I'm not exactly sure how I would
have<00:02:34.170> been<00:02:34.320> able<00:02:34.410> to<00:02:34.560> take<00:02:34.740> out<00:02:34.890> his<00:02:35.010> chin<00:02:35.340> show

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:35.520 
have been able to take out his chin show

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:36.470 
have been able to take out his chin show
I<00:02:35.550> don't<00:02:35.850> know<00:02:35.970> if<00:02:36.060> I<00:02:36.090> would<00:02:36.180> have<00:02:36.270> been<00:02:36.390> able

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480 
I don't know if I would have been able

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.330 
I don't know if I would have been able
to<00:02:36.690> but<00:02:37.140> I<00:02:37.320> would<00:02:37.800> have<00:02:37.890> been<00:02:38.010> able<00:02:38.040> to<00:02:38.190> make

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
to but I would have been able to make

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:40.460 
to but I would have been able to make
this<00:02:38.459> match<00:02:38.700> a<00:02:38.880> lot<00:02:39.150> closer<00:02:39.450> so<00:02:39.840> I<00:02:39.870> got<00:02:40.080> to<00:02:40.170> do

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
this match a lot closer so I got to do

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.440 
this match a lot closer so I got to do
own<00:02:40.680> I<00:02:40.830> was<00:02:40.950> thinking<00:02:41.310> I<00:02:41.430> was<00:02:41.490> faster<00:02:42.060> but<00:02:42.300> I

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
own I was thinking I was faster but I

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.140 
own I was thinking I was faster but I
don't<00:02:42.600> know<00:02:42.660> why<00:02:42.989> because<00:02:43.950> star<00:02:44.610> you<00:02:44.760> has<00:02:44.970> like

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:45.150 
don't know why because star you has like

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.400 
don't know why because star you has like
I<00:02:45.480> think<00:02:46.050> 19<00:02:46.500> speed<00:02:47.130> max<00:02:47.610> which<00:02:48.060> is<00:02:48.330> a<00:02:48.660> pretty

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
I think 19 speed max which is a pretty

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:51.470 
I think 19 speed max which is a pretty
fast<00:02:49.709> for<00:02:49.830> a<00:02:49.950> little<00:02:50.100> cup<00:02:50.330> considering<00:02:51.330> the

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.480 
fast for a little cup considering the

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:54.560 
fast for a little cup considering the
highest<00:02:52.170> speed<00:02:52.470> is<00:02:52.590> 24<00:02:53.160> most<00:02:53.370> part<00:02:53.610> so<00:02:54.360> he

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:54.570 
highest speed is 24 most part so he

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:55.880 
highest speed is 24 most part so he
Thunderbolts<00:02:55.019> and<00:02:55.080> kills<00:02:55.290> me<00:02:55.380> off<00:02:55.500> the<00:02:55.590> easels

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
Thunderbolts and kills me off the easels

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.210 
Thunderbolts and kills me off the easels
crit<00:02:56.100> and<00:02:56.420> now<00:02:57.420> I<00:02:57.450> go<00:02:57.660> out<00:02:57.750> to<00:02:57.780> my<00:02:58.380> riolu<00:02:58.830> and<00:02:59.130> I

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
crit and now I go out to my riolu and I

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:00.440 
crit and now I go out to my riolu and I
do<00:02:59.280> what<00:02:59.550> I<00:02:59.580> should<00:02:59.820> have<00:02:59.850> done<00:02:59.940> with<00:03:00.180> my<00:03:00.390> dough

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
do what I should have done with my dough

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:03.620 
do what I should have done with my dough
do<00:03:00.780> low<00:03:00.930> but<00:03:01.280> obviously<00:03:02.280> since<00:03:02.880> I<00:03:03.120> didn't<00:03:03.420> I

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:03.630 
do low but obviously since I didn't I

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:06.130 
do low but obviously since I didn't I
don't<00:03:04.110> get<00:03:04.560> to<00:03:04.650> kill<00:03:04.769> off<00:03:04.920> the<00:03:04.950> star<00:03:05.370> you<00:03:05.550> and

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:06.140 
don't get to kill off the star you and

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:09.560 
don't get to kill off the star you and
yeah<00:03:07.140> so<00:03:07.440> he<00:03:07.560> serves<00:03:08.130> to<00:03:08.310> star<00:03:08.549> you<00:03:08.730> which<00:03:09.120> um

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:09.570 
yeah so he serves to star you which um

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:12.199 
yeah so he serves to star you which um
not<00:03:10.410> really<00:03:10.500> surprising<00:03:10.890> there<00:03:11.220> because<00:03:11.610> he

00:03:12.199 --> 00:03:12.209 
not really surprising there because he

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:14.240 
not really surprising there because he
won<00:03:12.390> just<00:03:12.660> get<00:03:12.810> off<00:03:12.930> a<00:03:12.959> very<00:03:13.260> powerful<00:03:13.680> hit<00:03:14.070> and

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:14.250 
won just get off a very powerful hit and

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.039 
won just get off a very powerful hit and
he<00:03:14.519> crits<00:03:14.790> me<00:03:14.940> which<00:03:15.150> I<00:03:15.299> doubt<00:03:15.630> mattered

00:03:16.039 --> 00:03:16.049 
he crits me which I doubt mattered

00:03:16.049 --> 00:03:17.630 
he crits me which I doubt mattered
because<00:03:16.170> I<00:03:16.350> have<00:03:16.470> a<00:03:16.500> life<00:03:16.709> orb<00:03:16.950> near<00:03:17.160> thing<00:03:17.370> and

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:17.640 
because I have a life orb near thing and

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:20.690 
because I have a life orb near thing and
not<00:03:18.360> exactly<00:03:18.720> bulky<00:03:19.260> or<00:03:19.290> anything<00:03:19.739> so<00:03:20.370> do<00:03:20.459> I<00:03:20.489> go

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
not exactly bulky or anything so do I go

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.520 
not exactly bulky or anything so do I go
out<00:03:20.820> to<00:03:20.880> my<00:03:21.000> lastest<00:03:21.480> ghastly<00:03:22.019> which<00:03:22.230> I<00:03:22.350> should

out to my lastest ghastly which I should
have<00:03:22.620> fought<00:03:22.890> heard<00:03:23.040> instead<00:03:23.430> of<00:03:23.519> my

have fought heard instead of my
Charmander<00:03:24.450> but<00:03:24.660> he<00:03:25.140> used<00:03:25.290> to<00:03:25.380> kill<00:03:25.530> me<00:03:25.650> off

00:03:25.789 --> 00:03:25.799 
Charmander but he used to kill me off

00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:28.160 
Charmander but he used to kill me off
with<00:03:26.010> my<00:03:26.250> historia<00:03:26.820> so<00:03:27.239> it<00:03:27.720> was<00:03:27.840> a<00:03:27.870> good<00:03:27.989> game

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170
