00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.200 
exhaust notes just really the throttle

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.250

and<00:01:41.260> it<00:01:41.380> just<00:01:41.800> makes<00:01:41.979> this<00:01:42.160> car<00:01:42.400> feels<00:01:42.610> so

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:43.000 
and it just makes this car feels so

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.050 
and it just makes this car feels so
quick<00:01:43.380> but<00:01:44.380> it<00:01:44.500> does<00:01:44.680> weigh<00:01:44.920> over<00:01:45.280> 2,000

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:46.060 
quick but it does weigh over 2,000

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:47.880 
quick but it does weigh over 2,000
kilograms<00:01:46.270> so<00:01:46.630> here<00:01:47.050> in<00:01:47.170> it's<00:01:47.320> hard<00:01:47.500> braking

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:47.890 
kilograms so here in it's hard braking

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.249 
kilograms so here in it's hard braking
zone<00:01:48.100> you<00:01:48.759> can<00:01:48.910> really<00:01:49.180> feel<00:01:49.360> that<00:01:49.390> weight<00:01:49.750> but

00:01:50.249 --> 00:01:50.259 
zone you can really feel that weight but

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:52.230 
zone you can really feel that weight but
lateral<00:01:50.800> body<00:01:50.979> control<00:01:51.280> is<00:01:51.310> quite<00:01:51.490> good<00:01:51.759> and

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:52.240 
lateral body control is quite good and

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:54.030 
lateral body control is quite good and
you<00:01:52.330> can<00:01:52.420> see<00:01:52.570> they're<00:01:52.770> dialing<00:01:53.770> into

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:54.040 
you can see they're dialing into

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.620 
you can see they're dialing into
oversteer<00:01:54.369> with<00:01:54.550> the<00:01:54.610> throttle<00:01:54.820> and<00:01:55.210> it<00:01:55.540> is

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:55.630 
oversteer with the throttle and it is

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:56.969 
oversteer with the throttle and it is
beautifully<00:01:56.229> balanced<00:01:56.590> just<00:01:56.770> how<00:01:56.860> you'd

00:01:56.969 --> 00:01:56.979 
beautifully balanced just how you'd

more positive on the front end it turns

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:01.110

than<00:05:08.000> the<00:05:08.060> BMW<00:05:08.770> it's<00:05:09.770> a<00:05:09.860> bit<00:05:10.010> easier<00:05:10.490> when<00:05:11.330> you

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:11.450 
than the BMW it's a bit easier when you

00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:13.210 
than the BMW it's a bit easier when you
go<00:05:11.630> sideways<00:05:11.930> it<00:05:12.320> snaps<00:05:12.530> back<00:05:12.680> a<00:05:12.740> bit<00:05:12.980> more

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:13.220 
go sideways it snaps back a bit more

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:14.580 
go sideways it snaps back a bit more
than<00:05:13.400> the<00:05:13.460> BMW<00:05:13.910> something<00:05:14.240> wires

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:14.590

controllable<00:05:15.590> in<00:05:15.680> a<00:05:15.740> slide<00:05:16.010> but<00:05:16.250> it's<00:05:16.370> more

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:17.000 
controllable in a slide but it's more

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.400 
controllable in a slide but it's more
than<00:05:17.150> good<00:05:17.300> enough<00:05:17.360> but<00:05:17.720> through<00:05:17.900> here<00:05:18.200> high

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:18.410 
than good enough but through here high

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:20.560 
than good enough but through here high
speed<00:05:18.680> change<00:05:18.890> direction<00:05:19.220> much<00:05:20.120> better<00:05:20.420> than

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:20.570 
speed change direction much better than

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:23.500 
speed change direction much better than
the<00:05:20.660> BMW<00:05:21.640> exhaust<00:05:22.640> that's<00:05:22.820> awesome

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:23.510 
the BMW exhaust that's awesome

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:27.520 
the BMW exhaust that's awesome
gearbox<00:05:24.080> is<00:05:24.350> fast<00:05:24.700> not<00:05:25.700> quite<00:05:26.000> as<00:05:26.840> nice<00:05:27.140> a<00:05:27.200> blip

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:27.530 
gearbox is fast not quite as nice a blip

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:28.750 
gearbox is fast not quite as nice a blip
on<00:05:27.620> the<00:05:27.680> dash<00:05:27.860> it<00:05:28.040> that's<00:05:28.190> business<00:05:28.430> to<00:05:28.550> BMW

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:28.760 
on the dash it that's business to BMW

00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:31.210 
on the dash it that's business to BMW
but<00:05:29.150> we're<00:05:29.300> talking<00:05:29.450> small<00:05:29.870> differences<00:05:30.410> ok

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:31.220 
but we're talking small differences ok

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:33.040 
but we're talking small differences ok
so<00:05:31.280> we're<00:05:31.460> going<00:05:31.550> to<00:05:31.610> smooth<00:05:32.360> it<00:05:32.540> out<00:05:32.600> now<00:05:32.840> and

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:33.050 
so we're going to smooth it out now and

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:35.080 
so we're going to smooth it out now and
start<00:05:33.320> a<00:05:33.380> time<00:05:33.620> lap<00:05:33.860> and<00:05:34.460> I<00:05:34.610> think<00:05:34.790> this<00:05:34.940> is

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:35.090 
start a time lap and I think this is

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:36.640 
start a time lap and I think this is
where<00:05:35.240> the<00:05:35.420> Mercedes<00:05:35.900> might<00:05:36.110> really<00:05:36.380> come

00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:36.650 
where the Mercedes might really come

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:38.380 
where the Mercedes might really come
into<00:05:36.770> its<00:05:36.890> own<00:05:37.070> you<00:05:37.190> have<00:05:37.250> to<00:05:37.340> be<00:05:37.430> careful<00:05:37.850> not

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:38.390 
into its own you have to be careful not

00:05:38.390 --> 00:05:40.030 
into its own you have to be careful not
to<00:05:38.600> hit<00:05:38.690> the<00:05:38.720> rev<00:05:38.930> limiter<00:05:39.380> has<00:05:39.710> it<00:05:39.860> really

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:40.040 
to hit the rev limiter has it really

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:42.820 
to hit the rev limiter has it really
killed<00:05:40.370> up<00:05:40.610> too<00:05:40.910> long<00:05:41.090> so<00:05:41.750> fourth<00:05:42.050> gear<00:05:42.290> down

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:42.830
