00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400 
this page loads up and then one slides

down the next is curl and roll away

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.109 
down the next is curl and roll away
which<00:01:10.710> I<00:01:10.860> think<00:01:11.100> looks<00:01:11.130> the<00:01:11.460> best<00:01:11.640> if<00:01:11.850> you<00:01:11.970> have

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
which I think looks the best if you have

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:17.270 
which I think looks the best if you have
a<00:01:12.150> lot<00:01:12.420> of<00:01:12.450> icons<00:01:12.960> on<00:01:13.110> the<00:01:13.140> page<00:01:14.299> and<00:01:16.159> what<00:01:17.159> it

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:17.280 
a lot of icons on the page and what it

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.730 
a lot of icons on the page and what it
basically<00:01:17.310> does<00:01:17.670> is<00:01:18.090> all<00:01:18.360> the<00:01:18.479> icons<00:01:18.869> fly<00:01:19.290> and

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
basically does is all the icons fly and

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.370 
basically does is all the icons fly and
then<00:01:20.670> make<00:01:20.909> a<00:01:20.939> ball<00:01:21.299> and<00:01:21.630> kind<00:01:21.840> of<00:01:21.930> roll<00:01:22.140> away

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
then make a ball and kind of roll away

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
then make a ball and kind of roll away
make<00:01:23.280> a<00:01:23.310> circle<00:01:23.840> movie<00:01:24.840> and<00:01:25.590> then<00:01:25.770> the<00:01:26.220> last

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:26.400 
make a circle movie and then the last

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.429 
make a circle movie and then the last
one<00:01:26.549> is<00:01:26.670> vertical<00:01:27.270> scrolling<00:01:27.630> which<00:01:27.930> was<00:01:28.110> just
