00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:15.870 
some bright colors around the focal

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:20.600

point the focal point cause been the
that<00:01:20.970> the<00:01:21.180> bar<00:01:24.320> that<00:01:25.320> these<00:01:25.590> colors<00:01:25.860> run<00:01:26.190> down

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
that the bar that these colors run down

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.340

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
places where I don't want them before it

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:40.440 
just disappears into the mist and use a

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:48.039 
just disappears into the mist and use a
damp<00:01:40.830> brush<00:01:41.040> for<00:01:41.340> this<00:01:41.460> now<00:01:41.729> at<00:01:41.940> this

it's going into that misty effect upon

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:58.600 
it's going into that misty effect upon
the<00:01:51.950> top<00:01:52.280> of<00:01:52.310> Cordy<00:01:54.939> I'm<00:01:55.939> just<00:01:56.689> trying<00:01:56.960> to<00:01:57.610> put

00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 
the top of Cordy I'm just trying to put

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:05.139 
the top of Cordy I'm just trying to put
in<00:01:58.759> the<00:01:59.000> the<00:01:59.600> main<00:01:59.869> features<00:02:03.610> this<00:02:04.610> remembers

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:05.149 
in the the main features this remembers

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:08.710 
in the the main features this remembers
got<00:02:05.890> like<00:02:06.890> red<00:02:07.189> in<00:02:07.340> it<00:02:07.459> so<00:02:07.729> it's<00:02:07.880> even<00:02:08.209> darker

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:08.720 
got like red in it so it's even darker

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050 
it's just a little bit stronger in turn

French ultramarine Erzberg coming back
so<00:03:26.680> this<00:03:27.099> will<00:03:27.250> be<00:03:27.370> for<00:03:27.610> these<00:03:29.610> trees<00:03:30.610> yeah

00:03:31.339 --> 00:03:31.349 
so this will be for these trees yeah

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:42.699 
so this will be for these trees yeah
this<00:03:32.349> is<00:03:32.530> the<00:03:32.680> number<00:03:32.920> six<00:03:33.190> brush

00:03:42.699 --> 00:03:42.709 

00:03:42.709 --> 00:03:46.089 

see<00:03:43.489> that<00:03:43.730> and<00:03:44.000> it<00:03:44.420> works<00:03:44.629> very<00:03:44.750> well<00:03:44.959> with<00:03:45.409> a

00:03:46.089 --> 00:03:46.099 
see that and it works very well with a

00:03:46.099 --> 00:03:49.479 
see that and it works very well with a
knock<00:03:46.700> put<00:03:47.000> a<00:03:47.209> paper<00:03:47.540> even<00:03:48.140> better<00:03:48.560> with<00:03:48.920> a

00:03:49.479 --> 00:03:49.489 
knock put a paper even better with a

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:56.660 
knock put a paper even better with a
rough<00:03:49.819> paper<00:03:50.829> so

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:56.670 

00:03:56.670 --> 00:03:59.630 

so<00:03:57.180> I'm<00:03:57.480> just<00:03:57.660> putting<00:03:58.050> in<00:03:58.140> these<00:03:58.640> darker

00:03:59.630 --> 00:03:59.640 
so I'm just putting in these darker

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:00.620 
so I'm just putting in these darker
issues<00:04:00.060> here

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:00.630 
issues here

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:35.250 
issues here
now<00:04:01.200> highlight<00:04:01.590> this<00:04:02.040> building

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:35.260 

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:39.549 

let's<00:04:35.920> roll

00:04:39.549 --> 00:04:39.559 

00:04:39.559 --> 00:04:43.119 

so<00:04:40.069> I<00:04:40.099> sometimes<00:04:40.549> talk<00:04:41.029> room<00:04:41.629> colors<00:04:42.169> into<00:04:43.039> the

00:04:43.119 --> 00:04:43.129 
so I sometimes talk room colors into the

00:04:43.129 --> 00:04:45.699 
so I sometimes talk room colors into the
foreground<00:04:43.399> colors<00:04:44.179> that<00:04:44.389> are<00:04:44.539> not<00:04:45.199> actually

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:45.709 
foreground colors that are not actually

00:04:45.709 --> 00:04:52.119 
foreground colors that are not actually
there<00:04:46.329> but<00:04:47.329> I<00:04:47.389> think<00:04:48.049> would<00:04:50.409> it<00:04:51.409> would<00:04:51.559> benefit

00:04:52.119 --> 00:04:52.129 
there but I think would it would benefit

00:04:52.129 --> 00:05:02.249 
there but I think would it would benefit
the<00:04:52.399> scene<00:04:52.969> from<00:04:57.939> one<00:04:58.939> or<00:04:59.059> two<00:04:59.089> there<00:04:59.479> as<00:04:59.629> well

00:05:02.249 --> 00:05:02.259 

00:05:02.259 --> 00:05:05.739
