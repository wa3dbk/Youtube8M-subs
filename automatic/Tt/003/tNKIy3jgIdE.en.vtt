loving all sorts problems with my glutes
at<00:00:10.590> the<00:00:10.650> moment<00:00:11.179> it's<00:00:12.179> just<00:00:12.240> been<00:00:12.509> in<00:00:12.630> the

at the moment it's just been in the
racing<00:00:13.650> garbage<00:00:13.980> to<00:00:14.219> swing<00:00:14.400> down<00:00:14.580> attuned

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
racing garbage to swing down attuned

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:16.849 
racing garbage to swing down attuned
clutch<00:00:15.330> worked<00:00:15.570> for<00:00:15.780> ID<00:00:15.929> and<00:00:16.379> I'm<00:00:16.440> back<00:00:16.710> to

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
clutch worked for ID and I'm back to

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.500 
clutch worked for ID and I'm back to
normal<00:00:17.190> I<00:00:17.400> thought<00:00:17.850> maybe<00:00:18.060> it<00:00:18.180> was<00:00:18.240> a<00:00:18.300> clutch

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
normal I thought maybe it was a clutch

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.330 
normal I thought maybe it was a clutch
cable<00:00:18.750> so<00:00:19.140> while<00:00:19.500> I'm<00:00:19.619> doing<00:00:19.859> this<00:00:20.010> I'm<00:00:20.189> also

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
cable so while I'm doing this I'm also

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:21.679 
cable so while I'm doing this I'm also
going<00:00:20.550> to<00:00:20.609> put<00:00:20.760> a<00:00:20.789> new<00:00:20.939> clutch<00:00:21.150> cable<00:00:21.359> housing

00:00:21.679 --> 00:00:21.689 
going to put a new clutch cable housing

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:24.380 
going to put a new clutch cable housing
in<00:00:22.189> well<00:00:23.189> anyway<00:00:23.550> only<00:00:23.880> all<00:00:24.090> over<00:00:24.119> the

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
in well anyway only all over the

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.540 
in well anyway only all over the
Internet's<00:00:24.750> trying<00:00:25.050> to<00:00:25.109> find<00:00:25.289> how<00:00:25.740> to<00:00:25.769> bubble

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
Internet's trying to find how to bubble

Internet's trying to find how to bubble
blah<00:00:26.699> I<00:00:27.000> decided<00:00:27.840> the<00:00:27.960> best<00:00:28.050> way<00:00:28.170> to<00:00:28.289> do<00:00:28.470> it<00:00:28.590> was

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
blah I decided the best way to do it was

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.070 
blah I decided the best way to do it was
to<00:00:28.769> take<00:00:29.010> off<00:00:29.220> and<00:00:29.429> get<00:00:29.580> myself<00:00:29.779> with<00:00:30.779> a<00:00:30.810> little

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
to take off and get myself with a little

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.569 
to take off and get myself with a little
a<00:00:31.170> little<00:00:31.439> bit<00:00:31.619> of<00:00:31.740> advice<00:00:31.980> from<00:00:32.219> YouTube

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579 
a little bit of advice from YouTube

a little bit of advice from YouTube
Google<00:00:33.000> here<00:00:33.149> in<00:00:33.270> there<00:00:33.420> but<00:00:33.690> I<00:00:33.930> reckon<00:00:34.620> I<00:00:34.649> want

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:34.770 
Google here in there but I reckon I want

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:36.139 
Google here in there but I reckon I want
to<00:00:34.890> take<00:00:35.040> something<00:00:35.280> apart<00:00:35.520> as<00:00:35.880> long<00:00:36.000> as<00:00:36.090> you

00:00:36.139 --> 00:00:36.149 
to take something apart as long as you

00:00:36.149 --> 00:00:37.130 
to take something apart as long as you
know<00:00:36.270> what<00:00:36.360> you're<00:00:36.450> doing<00:00:36.690> put<00:00:36.989> it<00:00:37.050> back

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
know what you're doing put it back

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.670 
know what you're doing put it back
together<00:00:37.290> again<00:00:38.690> anyway<00:00:39.980> once<00:00:40.980> this<00:00:41.129> is<00:00:41.309> off

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:42.680 
together again anyway once this is off

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.770 
together again anyway once this is off
you<00:00:43.680> got<00:00:43.890> six<00:00:44.399> bolts<00:00:44.640> here<00:00:44.879> they<00:00:45.420> need<00:00:45.570> to<00:00:45.629> come

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
you got six bolts here they need to come

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.479 
you got six bolts here they need to come
off<00:00:45.960> underneath<00:00:46.410> your<00:00:46.530> six<00:00:46.710> bolts<00:00:46.950> is<00:00:47.219> the

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
off underneath your six bolts is the

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.529 
off underneath your six bolts is the
pressure<00:00:47.670> plate<00:00:49.850> underneath<00:00:50.850> these<00:00:51.149> you<00:00:51.390> have

00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
pressure plate underneath these you have

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:53.240 
pressure plate underneath these you have
a<00:00:51.570> lot<00:00:51.660> of<00:00:51.690> Springs<00:00:52.050> you<00:00:52.739> have<00:00:52.829> to<00:00:52.920> take<00:00:53.129> these

00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:53.250 
a lot of Springs you have to take these

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.760 
a lot of Springs you have to take these
off<00:00:53.309> take<00:00:53.910> this<00:00:54.030> off<00:00:54.300> and<00:00:54.510> then<00:00:54.719> here<00:00:55.440> we<00:00:55.590> have

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
off take this off and then here we have

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.490 
off take this off and then here we have
the<00:00:56.219> clutch<00:00:56.520> discs<00:00:56.969> which<00:00:57.570> I<00:00:57.719> change<00:00:58.170> because

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
the clutch discs which I change because

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:00.529 
the clutch discs which I change because
it'll<00:00:59.160> got<00:00:59.340> a<00:00:59.370> higher<00:00:59.520> base<00:00:59.820> or<00:00:59.969> changing

00:01:00.529 --> 00:01:00.539 
it'll got a higher base or changing

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:03.229 
it'll got a higher base or changing
so<00:01:00.660> everything's<00:01:00.930> new<00:01:01.910> when<00:01:02.910> you<00:01:03.000> put<00:01:03.149> these

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
so everything's new when you put these

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:08.300 
so everything's new when you put these
back<00:01:03.480> on<00:01:03.739> there<00:01:04.739> is<00:01:04.860> a<00:01:04.890> torque<00:01:05.159> say<00:01:05.570> 7<00:01:06.570> NM<00:01:07.310> so

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
back on there is a torque say 7 NM so

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.210 
back on there is a torque say 7 NM so
we'll<00:01:08.970> talk<00:01:09.150> about<00:01:09.270> other<00:01:09.619> so<00:01:10.619> for<00:01:10.740> now<00:01:10.890> and

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.220 
we'll talk about other so for now and

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.010 
we'll talk about other so for now and
take<00:01:11.250> these<00:01:11.880> off<00:01:12.030> when<00:01:12.540> you<00:01:12.600> take<00:01:12.720> them<00:01:12.900> off

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:13.020 
take these off when you take them off

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.350 
take these off when you take them off
take<00:01:13.439> them<00:01:13.500> off<00:01:14.070> always<00:01:14.580> across<00:01:15.030> with<00:01:15.270> each

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:15.360 
take them off always across with each

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.240 
take them off always across with each
other<00:01:15.540> so<00:01:16.439> you<00:01:16.530> don't<00:01:16.680> buckle<00:01:16.979> your<00:01:17.100> pressure

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
other so you don't buckle your pressure

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.649 
other so you don't buckle your pressure
plate<00:01:17.549> it's<00:01:17.909> always<00:01:18.090> a<00:01:18.119> good<00:01:18.270> idea<00:01:18.330> when<00:01:18.600> you

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659 
plate it's always a good idea when you

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.050 
plate it's always a good idea when you
do<00:01:18.780> it<00:01:18.840> any<00:01:19.189> job<00:01:20.189> to<00:01:20.369> take<00:01:20.490> your<00:01:20.670> screws<00:01:20.880> off

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
do it any job to take your screws off

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.410 
do it any job to take your screws off
like<00:01:21.240> this<00:01:22.040> now<00:01:23.040> I<00:01:23.070> took<00:01:23.369> I<00:01:23.790> already<00:01:24.090> started

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:24.420 
like this now I took I already started

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.179 
like this now I took I already started
taking<00:01:24.600> these<00:01:24.900> off<00:01:25.110> before<00:01:25.290> it<00:01:25.740> takes<00:01:25.920> a<00:01:26.040> long

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
taking these off before it takes a long

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.920 
taking these off before it takes a long
time<00:01:26.460> but<00:01:26.700> I<00:01:26.880> just<00:01:27.180> show<00:01:27.330> what<00:01:27.479> happens<00:01:27.780> when

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
time but I just show what happens when

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:35.899 
time but I just show what happens when
you<00:01:28.020> get<00:01:28.170> them<00:01:28.320> off<00:01:34.250> as<00:01:35.250> you<00:01:35.340> can<00:01:35.400> see<00:01:35.640> every

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
you get them off as you can see every

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.760 
you get them off as you can see every
time<00:01:36.119> I<00:01:36.150> take<00:01:36.450> the<00:01:36.600> screw<00:01:36.900> the<00:01:37.290> pressure<00:01:37.530> plate

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
time I take the screw the pressure plate

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:42.440 
time I take the screw the pressure plate
comes<00:01:38.040> up<00:01:38.250> because<00:01:38.430> of<00:01:38.640> the<00:01:38.700> springs<00:01:41.240> once<00:01:42.240> it

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:42.450 
comes up because of the springs once it

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:59.910 
comes up because of the springs once it
will<00:01:42.570> like<00:01:43.310> do<00:01:44.310> anything<00:01:44.430> really

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:02.240 

so

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
so

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.410 
so
pressure<00:02:03.180> plate<00:02:03.680> comes<00:02:04.680> off<00:02:05.180> so<00:02:06.180> you<00:02:06.270> go

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
pressure plate comes off so you go

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.920 
pressure plate comes off so you go
inside<00:02:06.740> easier<00:02:07.740> Springs

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:08.930 
inside easier Springs

00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:19.880 
inside easier Springs
take<00:02:09.930> them<00:02:10.080> up<00:02:15.140> you<00:02:16.140> have<00:02:16.200> like<00:02:16.530> so<00:02:18.710> and<00:02:19.710> then

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
take them up you have like so and then

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:23.150
