apparently only work on computers not on
mobile<00:00:56.280> devices<00:00:56.309> and<00:00:56.879> so<00:00:57.600> you<00:00:58.379> know<00:00:58.410> the<00:00:58.590> whole

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
mobile devices and so you know the whole

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.200 
mobile devices and so you know the whole

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
thing kind of hinges on using a playlist

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:01.369 
thing kind of hinges on using a playlist
it's<00:01:00.420> just<00:01:00.629> something<00:01:00.690> that<00:01:00.870> we<00:01:00.989> have<00:01:01.079> to<00:01:01.199> hope

00:01:01.369 --> 00:01:01.379 
it's just something that we have to hope

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:03.830 
it's just something that we have to hope
uh<00:01:01.590> is<00:01:02.489> a<00:01:02.550> feature<00:01:03.000> that<00:01:03.090> comes<00:01:03.270> to<00:01:03.449> mobile<00:01:03.629> at

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
uh is a feature that comes to mobile at

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.929 
uh is a feature that comes to mobile at
some<00:01:04.019> point<00:01:04.260> because<00:01:04.439> you<00:01:05.189> know<00:01:05.309> mobile

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
some point because you know mobile

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.600 
some point because you know mobile
obviously<00:01:06.450> is<00:01:06.540> behind<00:01:06.900> computers<00:01:07.409> and<00:01:08.250> what

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
obviously is behind computers and what

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.539 
obviously is behind computers and what
the<00:01:09.030> regular<00:01:09.479> browser<00:01:09.689> is<00:01:10.080> capable<00:01:10.500> of<00:01:10.619> so<00:01:10.979> it

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:11.549 
the regular browser is capable of so it

00:01:11.549 --> 00:01:13.039 
the regular browser is capable of so it
would<00:01:11.700> be<00:01:11.790> silly<00:01:12.030> to<00:01:12.150> hold<00:01:12.390> back<00:01:12.570> just<00:01:12.630> because

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
would be silly to hold back just because

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.880 
would be silly to hold back just because
mobile<00:01:14.040> is<00:01:14.400> held<00:01:15.210> back<00:01:15.420> but<00:01:15.720> we<00:01:16.110> are<00:01:16.530> doing<00:01:16.740> the

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
mobile is held back but we are doing the

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:18.380 
mobile is held back but we are doing the
best<00:01:16.920> we<00:01:17.070> can<00:01:17.159> to<00:01:17.430> sort<00:01:17.640> of<00:01:17.700> figure<00:01:17.880> it<00:01:18.090> out<00:01:18.180> for

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:18.390 
best we can to sort of figure it out for

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:21.080 
best we can to sort of figure it out for
now<00:01:18.540> we<00:01:19.170> put<00:01:19.380> links<00:01:19.650> in<00:01:19.740> the<00:01:19.860> info<00:01:20.220> rather<00:01:20.850> than

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
now we put links in the info rather than

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:22.609 
now we put links in the info rather than
you<00:01:21.450> watching<00:01:21.900> it<00:01:21.930> in<00:01:22.049> a<00:01:22.080> playlist<00:01:22.259> you<00:01:22.590> can

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
you watching it in a playlist you can

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.530 
you watching it in a playlist you can
click<00:01:23.040> through<00:01:23.280> to<00:01:23.310> each<00:01:23.490> video<00:01:23.759> it's<00:01:24.090> I<00:01:24.360> guess

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
click through to each video it's I guess

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.020 
click through to each video it's I guess
not<00:01:24.840> ideal<00:01:25.350> but<00:01:25.680> hopefully<00:01:26.580> mobile<00:01:26.880> we'll

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:27.030 
not ideal but hopefully mobile we'll

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.580 
not ideal but hopefully mobile we'll
catch<00:01:27.180> up<00:01:27.210> soon<00:01:27.420> enough<00:01:27.810> but<00:01:28.110> now<00:01:28.229> let's<00:01:28.380> get

i am not really looking forward to this

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:05.240 
i am not really looking forward to this
because<00:02:03.420> of<00:02:03.659> the<00:02:04.079> fact<00:02:04.259> that<00:02:04.409> like<00:02:04.649> i<00:02:04.770> said<00:02:05.040> it

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
because of the fact that like i said it

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.130 
because of the fact that like i said it
looks<00:02:05.460> just<00:02:05.579> like<00:02:05.729> Alice<00:02:06.060> in<00:02:06.149> Wonderland<00:02:06.540> Tim

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:07.140 
looks just like Alice in Wonderland Tim

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.690 
looks just like Alice in Wonderland Tim
Burton's<00:02:07.469> I<00:02:07.740> didn't<00:02:07.950> really<00:02:08.129> care<00:02:08.310> for<00:02:08.369> that

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700

but of course Disney I guess is trying

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.650 
but of course Disney I guess is trying
to<00:02:11.430> replicate<00:02:11.580> the<00:02:11.910> success<00:02:12.030> of<00:02:12.300> Alice<00:02:12.599> in

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:06.120 
that are under ten seconds long so it's

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:07.219 
that are under ten seconds long so it's
really<00:05:06.360> cool<00:05:06.479> because<00:05:06.539> literally<00:05:07.020> they<00:05:07.169> were

00:05:07.219 --> 00:05:07.229 
really cool because literally they were

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:09.230 
really cool because literally they were
like<00:05:07.409> well<00:05:07.590> why<00:05:07.770> would<00:05:08.009> we<00:05:08.099> clog<00:05:08.370> up<00:05:08.580> our<00:05:08.759> album

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:09.240 
like well why would we clog up our album

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:10.610 
like well why would we clog up our album
with<00:05:09.419> verses<00:05:09.870> that<00:05:09.990> we<00:05:10.110> don't<00:05:10.199> really<00:05:10.439> care

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:10.620 
with verses that we don't really care

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:12.320 
with verses that we don't really care
about<00:05:10.710> when<00:05:10.949> we<00:05:11.039> just<00:05:11.189> have<00:05:11.310> one<00:05:11.520> musical<00:05:12.060> idea

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:12.330 
about when we just have one musical idea

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:13.939 
about when we just have one musical idea
so<00:05:12.900> that's<00:05:13.050> something<00:05:13.229> that's<00:05:13.409> really<00:05:13.650> cool

00:05:13.939 --> 00:05:13.949 
so that's something that's really cool

00:05:13.949 --> 00:05:15.980
