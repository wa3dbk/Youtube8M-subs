00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:10.809
 good this is the boxing d 

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:18.780
 the car audio system 

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:21.289
 it's philips brand 

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:23.840
 the model is the 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:27.710
 the model 

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:29.620
 the c130 aids is worth 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:31.720
 this is a 

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:35.460
 come on a player or a stereo like 

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:42.440
 you want to call for cars 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:42.440
 and it's a cd with sd player 

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:49.700
 does not bring a CD player since the person 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:53.590
 who installs it in the car says that already 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:58.930
 he does not want to have more this album looks at 

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:58.930
 the car but we're not going to open it 

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:09.430
 here is in some of the 

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:09.430
 characteristics 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:36.220
 we are going to see the content of the 

00:01:32.649 --> 00:01:40.420
 manual voucher 

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:42.990
 some badges that I imagine is for 

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:46.250
 remove the casing 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.250
 the embellisher 

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.100
 a power cable 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.560
 the player as such 

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:28.920
 OK 

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:32.630
 the antenna the cornets right left 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:32.630
 It does not look good, I think 

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:40.280
 well now it looks better entry 

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:40.280
 current 

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.740
 this entity brings a listening 

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:18.720
 on the cover of the thing is for nothing 

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:22.650
 to play the music as you can 

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:25.070
 see has a usb an exit or entry of 

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:25.070
 auxiliary audio 

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:31.790
 and the sd connects here 

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:33.610
 the sd is covered when you place the 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:36.440
 cover 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:37.880
 and then nothing 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:40.270
 a little more I can say about this one 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:40.270
 boxing 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:45.970
