as such I had actually forgotten how

00:02:09.030 --> 00:02:11.630 
as such I had actually forgotten how
visually<00:02:09.989> interesting<00:02:10.440> invader<00:02:11.009> zim<00:02:11.129> was

Niq<00:02:14.040> says<00:02:14.370> racking<00:02:15.060> focus<00:02:15.600> which<00:02:15.810> is

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
Niq says racking focus which is

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.480 
Niq says racking focus which is
something<00:02:16.110> you<00:02:16.319> don't<00:02:16.440> usually<00:02:16.560> think<00:02:17.160> to<00:02:17.280> do

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:17.490 
something you don't usually think to do

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:19.850 
something you don't usually think to do
in<00:02:17.670> animation<00:02:17.870> that's<00:02:18.870> when<00:02:19.140> something<00:02:19.740> the

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
in animation that's when something the

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:21.110 
in animation that's when something the
foregrounds<00:02:20.280> InFocus<00:02:20.730> something<00:02:21.030> of

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
foregrounds InFocus something of

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.340 
foregrounds InFocus something of
backgrounds<00:02:21.480> out<00:02:21.569> of<00:02:21.660> focus<00:02:21.990> then<00:02:22.200> you

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
backgrounds out of focus then you

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.470 
backgrounds out of focus then you
basically<00:02:23.069> switch<00:02:23.340> the<00:02:23.520> focuses<00:02:24.060> then

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:24.480 
basically switch the focuses then

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:25.910 
basically switch the focuses then
there's<00:02:24.870> is<00:02:25.080> of<00:02:25.200> course<00:02:25.440> how<00:02:25.560> they<00:02:25.709> do<00:02:25.800> the

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:25.920 
there's is of course how they do the

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.040 
there's is of course how they do the
spaceships<00:02:26.430> with<00:02:26.610> a<00:02:26.640> CG<00:02:27.120> which<00:02:27.360> actually

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:28.050 
spaceships with a CG which actually

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:29.990 
spaceships with a CG which actually
looks<00:02:28.319> legitimately<00:02:29.010> good<00:02:29.430> because<00:02:29.850> it's

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:30.000 
looks legitimately good because it's

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.550 
looks legitimately good because it's
supposed<00:02:30.180> to<00:02:30.330> be<00:02:30.450> kind<00:02:30.630> of<00:02:30.780> otherworldly

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:31.560 
supposed to be kind of otherworldly

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.530 
supposed to be kind of otherworldly
instead<00:02:32.310> of<00:02:32.400> just<00:02:32.490> using<00:02:32.670> CG<00:02:33.180> for<00:02:33.390> like

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:33.540 
instead of just using CG for like

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:36.170 
instead of just using CG for like
something<00:02:33.959> stupid<00:02:34.410> like<00:02:34.440> cars<00:02:35.040> there's<00:02:35.940> a<00:02:36.000> lot

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:36.180 
something stupid like cars there's a lot

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:37.880 
something stupid like cars there's a lot

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:37.890 
of interesting things here and there's

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.650 
of interesting things here and there's
even<00:02:38.160> a<00:02:38.220> really<00:02:38.459> good<00:02:38.640> choke<00:02:38.940> where<00:02:39.180> Zim

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:39.660 
even a really good choke where Zim

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.920 
even a really good choke where Zim
fights<00:02:39.930> a<00:02:40.080> ham<00:02:40.380> demon<00:02:40.980> off-screen<00:02:41.910> and<00:02:42.360> his
