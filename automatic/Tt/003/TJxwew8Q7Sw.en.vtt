and see the inner mucosal lining the

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:03.530 
and see the inner mucosal lining the
cheek<00:04:58.250> you'll<00:04:59.250> also<00:04:59.430> have<00:04:59.790> the<00:05:02.540> inferior

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:03.540 
cheek you'll also have the inferior

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:05.480 
cheek you'll also have the inferior
dental<00:05:04.020> nerve<00:05:04.230> which<00:05:04.890> will<00:05:05.040> enter<00:05:05.370> the

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:05.490 
dental nerve which will enter the

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:08.240 
dental nerve which will enter the
mandibular<00:05:05.880> canal<00:05:06.500> his<00:05:07.500> sensory<00:05:07.980> to<00:05:08.160> the

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:08.250 
mandibular canal his sensory to the

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:11.150 
mandibular canal his sensory to the
lower<00:05:08.430> teeth<00:05:08.790> and<00:05:09.350> the<00:05:10.350> inferior<00:05:10.770> dental

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:11.160 
lower teeth and the inferior dental

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:12.860 
lower teeth and the inferior dental
nerve<00:05:11.310> will<00:05:11.520> actually<00:05:11.850> exit<00:05:12.240> the<00:05:12.360> mental

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:12.870 
nerve will actually exit the mental

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:16.550 
nerve will actually exit the mental
foramen<00:05:13.110> on<00:05:13.590> the<00:05:14.220> mandible<00:05:14.670> to<00:05:14.900> give<00:05:15.900> sensory

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:16.560 
foramen on the mandible to give sensory

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:21.530 
foramen on the mandible to give sensory
innervation<00:05:16.680> to<00:05:17.220> the<00:05:17.640> area<00:05:18.000> of<00:05:18.150> the<00:05:18.450> chin<00:05:20.540> the

00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:21.540 
innervation to the area of the chin the

00:05:21.540 --> 00:05:25.280 
innervation to the area of the chin the
other<00:05:21.720> branch<00:05:22.080> of<00:05:22.760> the<00:05:23.760> mandibular<00:05:24.660> branch<00:05:24.900> of

00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:25.290 
other branch of the mandibular branch of

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:32.390 
other branch of the mandibular branch of
trigeminal<00:05:29.540> is<00:05:30.540> the<00:05:30.810> lingual<00:05:31.200> nerve<00:05:31.230> and<00:05:32.130> the

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:32.400 
trigeminal is the lingual nerve and the

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:33.890 
trigeminal is the lingual nerve and the
lingual<00:05:32.760> nerve<00:05:32.790> will<00:05:33.150> end<00:05:33.270> up<00:05:33.390> going<00:05:33.660> to<00:05:33.780> the

00:05:33.890 --> 00:05:33.900 
lingual nerve will end up going to the

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:36.380 
lingual nerve will end up going to the
tongue<00:05:34.110> and<00:05:34.320> will<00:05:35.130> give<00:05:35.400> sensory<00:05:36.240> innervation

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:36.390 
tongue and will give sensory innervation

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:41.780 
tongue and will give sensory innervation
to<00:05:37.020> the<00:05:37.380> anterior<00:05:38.070> 2/3<00:05:38.550> of<00:05:38.700> the<00:05:38.820> tongue<00:05:40.790> now

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:41.790 
to the anterior 2/3 of the tongue now

00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:42.950 
to the anterior 2/3 of the tongue now
that<00:05:41.970> we're<00:05:42.090> on<00:05:42.120> the<00:05:42.300> tongue<00:05:42.540> let's<00:05:42.780> just

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:42.960 
that we're on the tongue let's just

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:44.410 
that we're on the tongue let's just
quickly<00:05:43.140> discuss<00:05:43.620> the<00:05:43.770> tongue<00:05:43.980> itself

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:44.420 
quickly discuss the tongue itself

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:47.090 
quickly discuss the tongue itself
because<00:05:45.420> it<00:05:45.600> comes<00:05:45.810> because<00:05:46.230> it<00:05:46.500> gets

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:47.100 
because it comes because it gets

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:48.440 
because it comes because it gets
innovation<00:05:47.610> from<00:05:47.940> several<00:05:48.300> different

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:48.450 
innovation from several different

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:51.020 
innovation from several different
branches<00:05:48.990> and<00:05:49.410> you'll<00:05:50.370> eventually<00:05:50.550> see<00:05:50.880> those

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:51.030 
branches and you'll eventually see those

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:52.580 
branches and you'll eventually see those
branches<00:05:51.270> as<00:05:51.540> they<00:05:51.660> get<00:05:51.810> to<00:05:51.960> them<00:05:52.080> and<00:05:52.230> the

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:52.590 
branches as they get to them and the

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:55.310 
branches as they get to them and the
frame<00:05:52.800> and<00:05:52.980> that<00:05:53.040> they<00:05:53.160> go<00:05:53.280> through
