flares<00:01:24.689> too<00:01:24.990> early<00:01:25.380> or<00:01:25.409> else<00:01:25.680> the<00:01:25.770> missile

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
flares too early or else the missile

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.249 
flares too early or else the missile
will<00:01:26.130> still<00:01:26.280> hit<00:01:26.400> you<00:01:26.640> so<00:01:27.450> after<00:01:27.780> you<00:01:27.960> do<00:01:28.110> that

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
will still hit you so after you do that

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:31.460 
will still hit you so after you do that
twice<00:01:28.560> you<00:01:28.729> deploy<00:01:29.729> flares<00:01:30.000> and<00:01:30.380> distract<00:01:31.380> the

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
twice you deploy flares and distract the

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.560 
twice you deploy flares and distract the
enemy<00:01:31.680> missiles<00:01:32.130> you'll<00:01:32.610> start<00:01:32.909> targeting

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:33.570 
enemy missiles you'll start targeting

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.590 
enemy missiles you'll start targeting
the<00:01:33.869> enemy<00:01:34.200> for<00:01:34.500> your<00:01:34.740> own<00:01:34.860> attacks<00:01:35.360> now<00:01:36.360> what

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
the enemy for your own attacks now what

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:37.760 
the enemy for your own attacks now what
you<00:01:36.689> want<00:01:36.869> to<00:01:36.900> do<00:01:37.020> is<00:01:37.140> you<00:01:37.229> want<00:01:37.380> to<00:01:37.470> wait<00:01:37.619> until

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:37.770 
you want to do is you want to wait until

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.530 
you want to do is you want to wait until
he<00:01:38.009> deploys<00:01:38.369> basically<00:01:39.090> a<00:01:39.119> few<00:01:39.270> sets<00:01:39.450> of

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
he deploys basically a few sets of

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.929 
he deploys basically a few sets of
flares<00:01:39.810> and<00:01:40.140> that<00:01:41.070> was<00:01:41.189> the<00:01:41.280> second<00:01:41.610> set<00:01:41.759> right

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:41.939 
flares and that was the second set right

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:43.130 
flares and that was the second set right
there<00:01:42.090> because<00:01:42.270> when<00:01:42.420> he<00:01:42.479> passes<00:01:42.930> you<00:01:43.020> he

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
there because when he passes you he

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.420 
there because when he passes you he
deploys<00:01:43.439> one<00:01:43.680> and<00:01:43.799> then<00:01:43.890> when<00:01:44.040> he's<00:01:44.130> in<00:01:44.220> front

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
deploys one and then when he's in front

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.280 
deploys one and then when he's in front
if<00:01:44.490> he<00:01:44.579> deploys<00:01:44.939> another<00:01:45.240> set<00:01:45.780> of<00:01:45.899> flares<00:01:46.110> and

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:46.290 
if he deploys another set of flares and

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.450 
if he deploys another set of flares and
then<00:01:46.409> as<00:01:46.500> soon<00:01:46.619> as<00:01:46.710> he<00:01:46.770> deploys<00:01:47.070> that<00:01:47.220> second

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
then as soon as he deploys that second

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.730 
then as soon as he deploys that second
set<00:01:47.579> of<00:01:47.610> flares<00:01:47.850> when<00:01:48.540> your<00:01:48.750> jet<00:01:49.259> kind<00:01:49.560> of<00:01:49.619> gets

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
set of flares when your jet kind of gets

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.260 
set of flares when your jet kind of gets
in<00:01:49.860> front<00:01:50.009> of<00:01:50.130> his<00:01:50.280> in<00:01:50.700> front<00:01:50.939> of<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.060> flares

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
in front of his in front of the flares

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.179 
in front of his in front of the flares
that<00:01:51.360> he's<00:01:51.540> deployed<00:01:51.899> second<00:01:52.409> just<00:01:53.009> fire<00:01:53.159> off

00:01:53.179 --> 00:01:53.189 
that he's deployed second just fire off

00:01:53.189 --> 00:01:55.249 
that he's deployed second just fire off
your<00:01:53.460> missile<00:01:53.759> the<00:01:54.240> second<00:01:54.630> guy<00:01:54.720> he's<00:01:54.990> coming

00:01:55.249 --> 00:01:55.259 
your missile the second guy he's coming

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:56.810 
your missile the second guy he's coming
towards<00:01:55.619> you<00:01:55.740> so<00:01:55.979> he<00:01:56.159> can't<00:01:56.399> even<00:01:56.610> shoot

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820 
towards you so he can't even shoot

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.249 
towards you so he can't even shoot
flares<00:01:57.180> if<00:01:57.360> you<00:01:57.420> shoot<00:01:57.600> a<00:01:57.659> missile<00:01:57.780> so<00:01:58.020> as<00:01:58.140> soon

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259 
flares if you shoot a missile so as soon

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:00.230 
flares if you shoot a missile so as soon
as<00:01:58.380> you<00:01:58.500> see<00:01:58.619> that<00:01:58.770> second<00:01:59.100> guy<00:01:59.189> I<00:01:59.430> you<00:02:00.149> know

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
as you see that second guy I you know

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.719 
as you see that second guy I you know
the<00:02:00.420> orange<00:02:00.750> crosshairs<00:02:01.649> or<00:02:01.829> whatever<00:02:02.070> is<00:02:02.310> on

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:02.729 
the orange crosshairs or whatever is on

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:04.130 
the orange crosshairs or whatever is on
him<00:02:02.880> just<00:02:03.030> shoot<00:02:03.420> your<00:02:03.570> missile<00:02:03.659> you<00:02:03.960> don't

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
him just shoot your missile you don't

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:05.690 
him just shoot your missile you don't
have<00:02:04.229> to<00:02:04.290> worry<00:02:04.469> about<00:02:04.560> him<00:02:05.130> dropping<00:02:05.460> flares

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:05.700 
have to worry about him dropping flares

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.880 
have to worry about him dropping flares
or<00:02:05.909> anything<00:02:06.060> like<00:02:06.240> that<00:02:06.290> so<00:02:07.290> that's<00:02:07.439> two<00:02:07.680> guys

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
or anything like that so that's two guys

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.430 
or anything like that so that's two guys
down<00:02:08.190> and<00:02:08.429> I<00:02:08.520> think<00:02:08.759> I<00:02:09.000> counted<00:02:09.179> a<00:02:09.420> seven<00:02:10.050> total

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:10.440 
down and I think I counted a seven total

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:12.650 
down and I think I counted a seven total
so<00:02:11.400> you<00:02:11.459> should<00:02:11.819> only<00:02:11.849> be<00:02:12.060> firing<00:02:12.270> seven

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
so you should only be firing seven

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.120 
so you should only be firing seven
rocket

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
rocket

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:16.090 
rocket
you<00:02:13.520> fire<00:02:13.730> more<00:02:13.940> than<00:02:13.970> seven<00:02:14.330> rockets<00:02:15.100> you

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:16.100 
you fire more than seven rockets you

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:18.490 
you fire more than seven rockets you
might<00:02:16.310> not<00:02:16.460> get<00:02:16.580> the<00:02:16.700> trophy<00:02:17.090> but<00:02:18.080> basically

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500 
might not get the trophy but basically

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.650 
might not get the trophy but basically
after<00:02:18.650> those<00:02:18.860> two<00:02:19.070> guys<00:02:19.310> don't<00:02:20.060> try<00:02:20.360> to<00:02:20.420> shoot

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
after those two guys don't try to shoot

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:22.030 
after those two guys don't try to shoot
any<00:02:20.840> more<00:02:21.020> rockets<00:02:21.470> because<00:02:21.710> the<00:02:21.800> next

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
any more rockets because the next

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.490 
any more rockets because the next
sequence<00:02:22.280> are<00:02:22.460> going<00:02:22.640> to<00:02:22.700> be<00:02:23.290> coming<00:02:24.290> up<00:02:24.470> here

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
sequence are going to be coming up here

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.280 
sequence are going to be coming up here

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:50.860 
flares when you need to so he shoots a
missile<00:02:49.940> and<00:02:50.030> I<00:02:50.090> see<00:02:50.270> it<00:02:50.360> coming<00:02:50.540> towards<00:02:50.630> me

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:50.870 
missile and I see it coming towards me

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:52.210 
missile and I see it coming towards me
but<00:02:50.960> I<00:02:51.050> kind<00:02:51.230> of<00:02:51.290> waited<00:02:51.410> until<00:02:51.710> it<00:02:51.890> was<00:02:52.010> closer

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:52.220 
but I kind of waited until it was closer

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.010 
but I kind of waited until it was closer
to<00:02:52.370> me<00:02:52.580> that<00:02:52.730> the<00:02:52.790> to<00:02:53.060> deploy<00:02:53.330> my<00:02:53.480> flares<00:02:53.750> so

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:54.020 
to me that the to deploy my flares so

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.590 
to me that the to deploy my flares so
you<00:02:54.710> know<00:02:54.800> keep<00:02:54.980> an<00:02:55.100> eye<00:02:55.220> you<00:02:55.970> know<00:02:56.090> on<00:02:56.210> where

00:02:56.590 --> 00:02:56.600 
you know keep an eye you know on where

00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.330 
you know keep an eye you know on where
the<00:02:56.720> missile<00:02:56.990> is<00:02:57.110> visuals<00:02:57.620> can<00:02:57.860> play<00:02:58.070> a<00:02:58.100> bit<00:02:58.310> of

00:02:58.330 --> 00:02:58.340 
the missile is visuals can play a bit of

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.450 
the missile is visuals can play a bit of
a<00:02:58.460> difference<00:02:59.230> but<00:03:00.230> apparently<00:03:00.530> he<00:03:00.770> only

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:01.460 
a difference but apparently he only

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:04.060 
a difference but apparently he only
fires<00:03:01.700> like<00:03:02.120> one<00:03:02.420> rocket<00:03:02.870> at<00:03:02.990> me<00:03:03.140> so<00:03:03.470> I<00:03:03.710> mean

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:04.070 
fires like one rocket at me so I mean

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:05.830 
fires like one rocket at me so I mean
deploying<00:03:04.640> the<00:03:04.760> flares<00:03:04.970> isn't<00:03:05.300> that<00:03:05.420> hard<00:03:05.630> so

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
deploying the flares isn't that hard so

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:06.550 
deploying the flares isn't that hard so
don't<00:03:05.930> sweat<00:03:06.230> it

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:06.560 
don't sweat it

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.480 
don't sweat it
you<00:03:06.950> know<00:03:07.070> but<00:03:07.970> anyways<00:03:08.270> I<00:03:08.800> see<00:03:09.800> him<00:03:10.130> deploy

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:10.490 
you know but anyways I see him deploy

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:12.850 
you know but anyways I see him deploy
one<00:03:10.700> set<00:03:10.850> of<00:03:10.970> flares<00:03:11.180> as<00:03:11.330> he<00:03:11.420> you<00:03:11.870> know<00:03:11.990> kind<00:03:12.800> of

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:12.860 
one set of flares as he you know kind of

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:14.770 
one set of flares as he you know kind of
passes<00:03:13.250> me<00:03:13.400> and<00:03:13.610> I'm<00:03:14.300> kind<00:03:14.540> of<00:03:14.600> waiting

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:14.780 
passes me and I'm kind of waiting

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:18.010 
passes me and I'm kind of waiting
waiting<00:03:15.470> and<00:03:15.880> it's<00:03:16.880> it's<00:03:17.060> key<00:03:17.300> to<00:03:17.330> be<00:03:17.480> patient

00:03:18.010 --> 00:03:18.020 
waiting and it's it's key to be patient

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:19.120 
waiting and it's it's key to be patient
you<00:03:18.050> don't<00:03:18.230> want<00:03:18.350> to<00:03:18.440> shoot<00:03:18.560> your<00:03:18.740> rockets<00:03:19.040> at

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:19.130 
you don't want to shoot your rockets at

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:21.240 
you don't want to shoot your rockets at
the<00:03:19.220> wrong<00:03:19.340> time<00:03:19.550> generally<00:03:20.030> after<00:03:20.900> they

00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:21.250 
the wrong time generally after they

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.440 
the wrong time generally after they
deploy<00:03:22.250> their<00:03:22.430> flares<00:03:22.700> you<00:03:22.820> can<00:03:23.060> shoot<00:03:23.270> them

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:23.450 
deploy their flares you can shoot them

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:25.540 
deploy their flares you can shoot them
but<00:03:23.630> I<00:03:23.660> was<00:03:23.840> just<00:03:23.990> playing<00:03:24.230> it<00:03:24.380> safe<00:03:24.590> making

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:25.550 
but I was just playing it safe making

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:26.860 
but I was just playing it safe making
sure<00:03:25.760> I<00:03:25.820> was<00:03:25.880> really<00:03:26.270> close<00:03:26.450> to<00:03:26.510> lot<00:03:26.750> my

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
sure I was really close to lot my

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:28.060 
sure I was really close to lot my
missile<00:03:27.200> won't<00:03:27.350> have<00:03:27.470> to<00:03:27.560> travel<00:03:27.710> too<00:03:28.040> far

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:28.070 
missile won't have to travel too far

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:29.860 
missile won't have to travel too far
giving<00:03:28.610> him<00:03:28.730> more<00:03:28.910> time<00:03:29.090> to<00:03:29.300> reload<00:03:29.840> his

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:29.870 
giving him more time to reload his

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:31.780 
giving him more time to reload his
flares<00:03:30.320> and<00:03:30.590> and<00:03:30.860> shoot<00:03:31.370> it<00:03:31.490> out<00:03:31.550> so<00:03:31.700> I'm

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
flares and and shoot it out so I'm

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:33.610 
flares and and shoot it out so I'm
fairly<00:03:31.910> close<00:03:32.270> I<00:03:32.420> fire<00:03:32.630> my<00:03:32.660> rocket<00:03:32.930> boom<00:03:33.350> there

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:33.620 
fairly close I fire my rocket boom there

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:35.830 
fairly close I fire my rocket boom there
we<00:03:33.650> go<00:03:33.800> he<00:03:33.950> just<00:03:33.980> deployed<00:03:34.850> a<00:03:34.910> flare<00:03:35.150> and<00:03:35.360> then

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:35.840 
we go he just deployed a flare and then

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.000 
we go he just deployed a flare and then
I<00:03:35.870> shoot<00:03:36.110> one<00:03:36.260> at<00:03:36.380> this<00:03:36.500> guy

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 
I shoot one at this guy

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:39.190 
I shoot one at this guy
I<00:03:37.040> don't<00:03:37.490> even<00:03:37.580> know<00:03:37.790> if<00:03:37.880> it<00:03:37.970> hit<00:03:38.150> him<00:03:38.180> but<00:03:38.840> he

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:39.200 
I don't even know if it hit him but he

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.290 
I don't even know if it hit him but he
obviously<00:03:39.320> didn't<00:03:39.710> deploy<00:03:39.860> flares<00:03:40.300> and

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:41.300 
obviously didn't deploy flares and

00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:44.100 
obviously didn't deploy flares and
because<00:03:41.540> my<00:03:41.630> missile<00:03:41.959> didn't<00:03:42.170> like<00:03:42.320> go<00:03:42.470> crazy

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:44.110 
because my missile didn't like go crazy

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:47.140 
because my missile didn't like go crazy
but<00:03:45.110> I<00:03:45.140> that's<00:03:45.920> where<00:03:46.310> I'm<00:03:46.459> not<00:03:46.640> too<00:03:46.820> sure<00:03:47.030> if

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:47.150 
but I that's where I'm not too sure if

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:49.000 
but I that's where I'm not too sure if
you<00:03:47.270> have<00:03:47.480> to<00:03:47.660> fire<00:03:47.870> only<00:03:48.080> seven<00:03:48.440> rockets<00:03:48.830> but

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:49.010 
you have to fire only seven rockets but

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:50.680 
you have to fire only seven rockets but
I<00:03:49.040> would<00:03:49.310> just<00:03:49.459> to<00:03:49.580> be<00:03:49.610> safe<00:03:49.880> only<00:03:50.120> fire<00:03:50.390> seven

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:50.690 
I would just to be safe only fire seven

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:52.210 
I would just to be safe only fire seven
because<00:03:50.840> that<00:03:51.020> was<00:03:51.140> actually<00:03:51.500> I<00:03:51.709> think<00:03:52.070> my

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:52.220 
because that was actually I think my

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:54.990 
because that was actually I think my
sixth<00:03:52.670> rocket<00:03:53.120> but<00:03:53.630> I<00:03:53.660> still<00:03:53.870> get<00:03:53.990> the<00:03:54.020> trophy

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
sixth rocket but I still get the trophy

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.910 
sixth rocket but I still get the trophy
but<00:03:56.000> again<00:03:56.209> just<00:03:56.390> to<00:03:56.480> be<00:03:56.510> safe<00:03:56.810> once<00:03:57.590> you<00:03:57.709> get

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:57.920 
but again just to be safe once you get

00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.680 
but again just to be safe once you get
that<00:03:58.070> fifth<00:03:58.340> that<00:03:58.610> fifth<00:03:58.880> guy<00:03:59.150> because<00:03:59.660> I

00:03:59.680 --> 00:03:59.690 
that fifth that fifth guy because I

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:01.150 
that fifth that fifth guy because I
didn't<00:03:59.900> see<00:04:00.050> that<00:04:00.200> the<00:04:00.500> sixth<00:04:00.800> guy<00:04:00.950> that<00:04:01.130> I

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:01.160 
didn't see that the sixth guy that I

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:02.650 
didn't see that the sixth guy that I
fired<00:04:01.459> the<00:04:01.520> rocket<00:04:01.640> app<00:04:01.880> blow<00:04:02.150> up<00:04:02.330> like<00:04:02.570> you

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:02.660 
fired the rocket app blow up like you

00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:05.199 
fired the rocket app blow up like you
should<00:04:02.840> blow<00:04:03.020> up<00:04:03.200> I'm<00:04:03.680> not<00:04:03.890> sure<00:04:04.130> if<00:04:04.820> I<00:04:04.940> killed

00:04:05.199 --> 00:04:05.209 
should blow up I'm not sure if I killed

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:06.790 
should blow up I'm not sure if I killed
it<00:04:05.360> but<00:04:05.630> you<00:04:05.900> know<00:04:05.990> again<00:04:06.260> just<00:04:06.470> to<00:04:06.530> be<00:04:06.560> safe

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:06.800 
it but you know again just to be safe

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:09.570 
it but you know again just to be safe
don't<00:04:07.610> worry<00:04:07.700> once<00:04:08.030> you<00:04:08.180> hit<00:04:08.330> those<00:04:08.540> five<00:04:08.780> guys

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:09.580 
don't worry once you hit those five guys

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:13.000 
don't worry once you hit those five guys
don't<00:04:10.580> shoot<00:04:10.730> any<00:04:10.880> more<00:04:11.000> rockets<00:04:11.420> and<00:04:12.010> you'll

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.010 
don't shoot any more rockets and you'll

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:14.470 
don't shoot any more rockets and you'll
come<00:04:13.220> to<00:04:13.310> this<00:04:13.400> mini<00:04:13.640> cutscene<00:04:14.090> and<00:04:14.360> then

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:14.480 
come to this mini cutscene and then

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:15.970 
come to this mini cutscene and then
you'll<00:04:14.630> have<00:04:14.750> these<00:04:14.959> last<00:04:15.200> two<00:04:15.440> guys<00:04:15.590> to<00:04:15.830> take

00:04:15.970 --> 00:04:15.980 
you'll have these last two guys to take

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:17.470 
you'll have these last two guys to take
care<00:04:16.010> of<00:04:16.250> here

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:17.480 
care of here

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:19.750 
care of here
basically<00:04:18.080> it's<00:04:18.410> just<00:04:18.500> you'll<00:04:19.010> deploy<00:04:19.430> flares

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:19.760 
basically it's just you'll deploy flares

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:21.250 
basically it's just you'll deploy flares
for<00:04:20.030> a<00:04:20.060> little<00:04:20.299> bit<00:04:20.480> so<00:04:20.660> don't<00:04:20.810> worry<00:04:20.930> about

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:21.260 
for a little bit so don't worry about

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:22.630 
for a little bit so don't worry about
anything<00:04:21.590> like<00:04:21.739> that<00:04:21.919> because<00:04:22.220> there<00:04:22.370> are<00:04:22.460> two

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:22.640 
anything like that because there are two

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:23.800 
anything like that because there are two
guys<00:04:22.790> behind<00:04:23.060> you<00:04:23.210> they're<00:04:23.330> gonna<00:04:23.419> kind<00:04:23.630> of<00:04:23.720> be

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:23.810 
guys behind you they're gonna kind of be

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:27.020 
guys behind you they're gonna kind of be
alternating<00:04:24.280> firing<00:04:25.360> missiles<00:04:26.360> at<00:04:26.479> you

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:27.030 
alternating firing missiles at you

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:28.880 
alternating firing missiles at you
so<00:04:27.540> just<00:04:27.720> sweat<00:04:27.900> it<00:04:27.930> out<00:04:28.140> I<00:04:28.170> mean<00:04:28.320> it's<00:04:28.590> not<00:04:28.680> too

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:28.890 
so just sweat it out I mean it's not too

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:30.470 
so just sweat it out I mean it's not too
hard<00:04:29.100> I<00:04:29.310> mean<00:04:29.460> when<00:04:29.580> you're<00:04:29.730> when<00:04:30.000> your<00:04:30.120> pilot

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:30.480 
hard I mean when you're when your pilot

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:32.690 
hard I mean when you're when your pilot
says<00:04:30.720> to<00:04:31.140> dump<00:04:31.350> the<00:04:31.470> flares<00:04:31.740> just<00:04:32.130> hit<00:04:32.250> the<00:04:32.340> l1

00:04:32.690 --> 00:04:32.700 
says to dump the flares just hit the l1

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:34.640 
says to dump the flares just hit the l1
you<00:04:33.210> should<00:04:33.450> be<00:04:33.600> in<00:04:33.810> a<00:04:33.900> fail-safe<00:04:34.080> position

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650 
you should be in a fail-safe position

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:35.990 
you should be in a fail-safe position
there<00:04:34.800> if<00:04:34.920> you<00:04:35.010> just<00:04:35.160> listen<00:04:35.490> for<00:04:35.640> his<00:04:35.760> key

00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:36.000 
there if you just listen for his key

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.900 
there if you just listen for his key

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:06.270 
got really close waited for him to

00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:08.330 
got really close waited for him to
deploy<00:05:06.600> that<00:05:06.870> set<00:05:07.169> of<00:05:07.260> flares<00:05:07.470> I<00:05:07.650> pass<00:05:07.890> it<00:05:08.160> and

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:08.340 
deploy that set of flares I pass it and

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:12.050 
deploy that set of flares I pass it and
then<00:05:08.520> I<00:05:08.640> shoot<00:05:08.880> my<00:05:09.060> rocket<00:05:09.450> boo<00:05:10.610> it<00:05:11.610> feels<00:05:11.820> good

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:12.060 
then I shoot my rocket boo it feels good

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:13.280 
then I shoot my rocket boo it feels good
when<00:05:12.270> you<00:05:12.390> hit<00:05:12.540> them<00:05:12.720> with<00:05:12.840> the<00:05:12.960> rocket<00:05:13.260> I

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:13.290 
when you hit them with the rocket I

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:14.570 
when you hit them with the rocket I
don't<00:05:13.470> know<00:05:13.530> what<00:05:13.680> it<00:05:13.770> is<00:05:13.860> it<00:05:14.040> just<00:05:14.070> feels<00:05:14.370> good

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:14.580 
don't know what it is it just feels good

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:16.790 
don't know what it is it just feels good
but<00:05:15.120> anyways<00:05:15.480> the<00:05:15.750> other<00:05:15.780> guy<00:05:16.110> will<00:05:16.380> you<00:05:16.680> know

00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:16.800 
but anyways the other guy will you know

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.950 
but anyways the other guy will you know
he'll<00:05:17.430> kind<00:05:17.610> of<00:05:17.730> be<00:05:17.790> behind<00:05:18.030> you<00:05:18.270> but<00:05:18.510> for<00:05:18.810> some

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:18.960 
he'll kind of be behind you but for some

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:22.280 
he'll kind of be behind you but for some
reason<00:05:19.320> he<00:05:19.800> didn't<00:05:20.330> bother<00:05:21.330> shooting

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:22.290 
reason he didn't bother shooting

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:24.200 
reason he didn't bother shooting
missiles<00:05:22.710> at<00:05:22.800> me<00:05:22.950> so<00:05:23.550> he's<00:05:23.730> just<00:05:23.880> deploying

00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:24.210 
missiles at me so he's just deploying

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:27.350 
missiles at me so he's just deploying
his<00:05:24.419> own<00:05:24.540> flares<00:05:24.810> now<00:05:25.050> and<00:05:25.970> again<00:05:26.970> this<00:05:27.150> is<00:05:27.270> the

00:05:42.270 --> 00:05:44.270 
know you because you're gaining speed on
him<00:05:42.390> and<00:05:42.570> you<00:05:43.320> see<00:05:43.500> him<00:05:43.530> deploy<00:05:43.890> his<00:05:44.010> flares

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:44.280 
him and you see him deploy his flares

00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:46.219 
him and you see him deploy his flares
the<00:05:44.430> secondly<00:05:44.790> that<00:05:45.150> your<00:05:45.300> that<00:05:45.660> your<00:05:45.720> jet

00:05:46.219 --> 00:05:46.229 
the secondly that your that your jet

00:05:46.229 --> 00:05:47.990 
the secondly that your that your jet
passes<00:05:46.770> his<00:05:46.919> flesh<00:05:47.130> shoot<00:05:47.400> the<00:05:47.490> rocket<00:05:47.850> and

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:48.000 
passes his flesh shoot the rocket and

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.790 
passes his flesh shoot the rocket and
that's<00:05:48.810> basically<00:05:49.080> what<00:05:49.229> I<00:05:49.260> did<00:05:49.380> through<00:05:49.680> this

00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:49.800 
that's basically what I did through this

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:52.010 
that's basically what I did through this
and<00:05:50.100> just<00:05:50.729> following<00:05:50.970> intuition<00:05:51.600> I<00:05:51.750> mean

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:52.020 
and just following intuition I mean

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:53.750 
and just following intuition I mean
there<00:05:52.169> may<00:05:52.260> be<00:05:52.290> some<00:05:52.410> set<00:05:52.800> pattern<00:05:53.190> that

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:53.760 
there may be some set pattern that

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:54.950 
there may be some set pattern that
somebody<00:05:54.090> might<00:05:54.180> figure<00:05:54.390> out<00:05:54.540> in<00:05:54.600> the<00:05:54.660> future

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:54.960 
somebody might figure out in the future

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:58.010 
somebody might figure out in the future
but<00:05:55.110> I<00:05:55.169> mean<00:05:55.410> it<00:05:55.590> worked<00:05:55.770> for<00:05:55.950> me<00:05:56.070> and<00:05:57.020> that's

00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:58.020 
but I mean it worked for me and that's

00:05:58.020 --> 00:05:59.180 
but I mean it worked for me and that's
all<00:05:58.110> you<00:05:58.200> got<00:05:58.320> to<00:05:58.380> do<00:05:58.470> once<00:05:58.680> you<00:05:58.740> kill<00:05:58.950> those

00:05:59.180 --> 00:05:59.190 
all you got to do once you kill those

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:02.620 
all you got to do once you kill those
seven<00:06:00.090> or<00:06:00.240> in<00:06:00.419> my<00:06:00.540> case<00:06:00.750> I<00:06:00.870> guess<00:06:01.020> eight<00:06:01.430> Jets

00:06:02.620 --> 00:06:02.630 
seven or in my case I guess eight Jets

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:05.210 
seven or in my case I guess eight Jets
just<00:06:03.630> pretty<00:06:03.870> much<00:06:04.020> play<00:06:04.800> through<00:06:04.979> the<00:06:05.070> rest

00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:05.220 
just pretty much play through the rest

00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:07.370 
just pretty much play through the rest
of<00:06:05.280> the<00:06:05.370> level<00:06:05.580> it's<00:06:05.700> just<00:06:05.850> a<00:06:05.940> bunch<00:06:06.090> of<00:06:06.380> you

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:07.380 
of the level it's just a bunch of you

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:08.570 
of the level it's just a bunch of you
know<00:06:07.470> talking<00:06:07.800> between<00:06:08.100> your<00:06:08.280> teammates

00:06:08.570 --> 00:06:08.580 
know talking between your teammates

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:11.090 
know talking between your teammates
flying<00:06:08.850> around<00:06:09.150> the<00:06:09.930> trophy<00:06:10.260> won't<00:06:10.440> pop<00:06:10.770> until

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:11.100 
flying around the trophy won't pop until

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:12.469 
flying around the trophy won't pop until
you<00:06:11.160> get<00:06:11.280> to<00:06:11.370> the<00:06:11.460> next<00:06:11.580> cutscene<00:06:12.090> or<00:06:12.210> to<00:06:12.390> the

00:06:12.469 --> 00:06:12.479 
you get to the next cutscene or to the

00:06:12.479 --> 00:06:14.810 
you get to the next cutscene or to the
next<00:06:12.720> checkpoint<00:06:12.930> so<00:06:13.800> the<00:06:14.220> next<00:06:14.400> time<00:06:14.550> that<00:06:14.729> it

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:14.820 
next checkpoint so the next time that it

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:17.630 
next checkpoint so the next time that it
saves<00:06:15.090> so<00:06:15.750> just<00:06:15.930> wait<00:06:16.140> wait<00:06:16.470> this<00:06:16.620> out<00:06:16.830> and<00:06:17.100> if

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:17.640 
saves so just wait wait this out and if

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:18.560 
saves so just wait wait this out and if
you<00:06:17.729> don't<00:06:17.880> get<00:06:18.000> it<00:06:18.120> you<00:06:18.180> can<00:06:18.300> always<00:06:18.479> head

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:18.570 
you don't get it you can always head

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:19.610 
you don't get it you can always head
start<00:06:18.840> you<00:06:18.960> have<00:06:18.990> to<00:06:19.080> restart<00:06:19.470> the<00:06:19.560> entire

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:19.620 
start you have to restart the entire

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:21.620 
start you have to restart the entire
mission<00:06:20.010> like<00:06:20.280> I<00:06:20.370> said<00:06:20.580> and<00:06:20.700> you<00:06:21.360> know<00:06:21.390> watch

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:21.630 
mission like I said and you know watch

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:23.450 
mission like I said and you know watch
the<00:06:21.780> cutscene<00:06:22.169> go<00:06:22.680> through<00:06:22.860> the<00:06:22.919> calibration

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:23.460 
the cutscene go through the calibration

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:24.770 
the cutscene go through the calibration
of<00:06:23.520> the<00:06:23.669> jet<00:06:23.880> and<00:06:23.910> all<00:06:24.120> that<00:06:24.270> stuff<00:06:24.510> and<00:06:24.690> then

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:24.780 
of the jet and all that stuff and then

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:28.280 
of the jet and all that stuff and then
retry<00:06:25.140> again<00:06:25.760> but<00:06:26.760> it<00:06:27.510> should<00:06:27.750> pop<00:06:27.960> pretty

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:28.290 
retry again but it should pop pretty

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:30.740 
retry again but it should pop pretty
much<00:06:28.500> as<00:06:28.770> soon<00:06:29.040> as<00:06:29.190> you<00:06:29.280> get<00:06:29.400> down<00:06:29.640> and<00:06:30.600> you

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:30.750 
much as soon as you get down and you

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:33.500 
much as soon as you get down and you
start<00:06:30.870> targeting<00:06:31.550> guys<00:06:32.550> with<00:06:32.880> the<00:06:33.090> like

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:33.510 
start targeting guys with the like

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:36.950 
start targeting guys with the like
infrared<00:06:34.760> targeting<00:06:35.760> system<00:06:36.090> below<00:06:36.570> the<00:06:36.720> jet

00:06:36.950 --> 00:06:36.960 
infrared targeting system below the jet

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:39.470 
infrared targeting system below the jet
there<00:06:37.919> we<00:06:38.039> go

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:39.480 
there we go

00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:42.150 
there we go
and<00:06:40.480> the<00:06:41.020> second<00:06:41.320> is<00:06:41.410> that<00:06:41.530> saving<00:06:41.800> on<00:06:42.070> the

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:42.160 
and the second is that saving on the

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:46.140 
and the second is that saving on the
screen<00:06:43.080> you<00:06:44.080> should<00:06:44.110> get<00:06:44.380> the<00:06:44.500> trophy<00:06:44.890> I<00:06:45.150> was

00:06:46.140 --> 00:06:46.150 
screen you should get the trophy I was

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:48.540 
screen you should get the trophy I was
like<00:06:46.300> come<00:06:46.480> on<00:06:46.510> baby<00:06:46.960> off<00:06:47.530> please<00:06:47.950> and<00:06:48.190> boom
