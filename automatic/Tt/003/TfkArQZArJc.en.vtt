mixing in the one effects to make this

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:51.139 
mixing in the one effects to make this
model<00:00:46.320> for<00:00:47.100> example<00:00:47.550> like<00:00:48.649> sublimating<00:00:50.149> like

00:00:51.139 --> 00:00:51.149 
model for example like sublimating like

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:58.220 
model for example like sublimating like
this<00:00:51.390> one<00:00:52.340> and<00:00:55.520> let's<00:00:56.870> recreate<00:00:57.870> these

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
this one and let's recreate these

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:03.380 
this one and let's recreate these
effects<00:00:59.190> from<00:00:59.520> the<00:00:59.699> beginning<00:01:01.250> using<00:01:02.390> these

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:03.390 
effects from the beginning using these

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:06.170 
effects from the beginning using these
different<00:01:04.049> nodes<00:01:04.379> I'm<00:01:05.159> talking<00:01:05.610> about<00:01:05.729> the

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:06.180 
different nodes I'm talking about the

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:11.320 
different nodes I'm talking about the
notes<00:01:07.040> because<00:01:08.040> everything<00:01:08.700> in<00:01:08.850> my<00:01:09.030> er<00:01:09.060> and<00:01:09.479> is

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:11.330 
notes because everything in my er and is

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.600 
notes because everything in my er and is
consists<00:01:12.330> of<00:01:12.570> the<00:01:12.930> notes<00:01:13.200> and<00:01:13.500> every<00:01:14.369> object

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
consists of the notes and every object

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:20.440 
consists of the notes and every object
is<00:01:15.030> the<00:01:15.350> several<00:01:16.350> nodes<00:01:16.619> and<00:01:18.830> mostly<00:01:19.830> and

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
is the several nodes and mostly and

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.840 
is the several nodes and mostly and
usually<00:01:21.450> I<00:01:21.689> talked<00:01:22.560> about<00:01:22.590> not<00:01:23.250> object<00:01:23.700> I

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:23.850 
usually I talked about not object I

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:26.450 
usually I talked about not object I
talked<00:01:24.150> about<00:01:24.180> notes<00:01:24.780> and<00:01:25.049> the<00:01:25.500> attributes<00:01:26.250> of

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:26.460 
talked about notes and the attributes of

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.450 
talked about notes and the attributes of
the<00:01:26.610> nodes<00:01:26.880> and<00:01:27.180> we<00:01:27.840> will<00:01:28.020> see<00:01:28.200> how<00:01:28.439> we<00:01:28.740> can<00:01:29.159> use

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460 
the nodes and we will see how we can use

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:33.649 
the nodes and we will see how we can use
this<00:01:29.640> approach<00:01:30.380> ok<00:01:31.380> let's<00:01:31.860> open<00:01:32.070> very<00:01:33.030> simple

00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:33.659 
this approach ok let's open very simple

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:40.190 
this approach ok let's open very simple
file<00:01:35.600> here<00:01:36.600> is<00:01:36.780> like<00:01:37.290> Venus<00:01:38.119> model<00:01:39.119> and<00:01:39.299> the

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:40.200 
file here is like Venus model and the

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.389 
file here is like Venus model and the
poly<00:01:40.530> plane<00:01:40.909> very<00:01:41.909> simple<00:01:42.299> objects<00:01:42.750> and<00:01:43.009> I<00:01:44.009> can

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
poly plane very simple objects and I can

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.679 
poly plane very simple objects and I can
select<00:01:44.759> this<00:01:45.210> polygonal<00:01:45.810> plane<00:01:46.259> and<00:01:47.210> go<00:01:48.210> to<00:01:48.270> n

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
select this polygonal plane and go to n

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.219 
select this polygonal plane and go to n
clothes<00:01:49.110> menu<00:01:49.560> and<00:01:49.970> create<00:01:50.970> the<00:01:51.689> end<00:01:51.960> cloth

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:52.229 
clothes menu and create the end cloth

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:58.630 
clothes menu and create the end cloth
and<00:01:52.610> I<00:01:53.610> can<00:01:53.820> see<00:01:54.030> it<00:01:54.149> working<00:01:54.920> then<00:01:55.920> I<00:01:56.310> can<00:01:56.850> I

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
and I can see it working then I can I

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:04.370 
and I can see it working then I can I
can<00:01:59.640> go<00:02:00.710> to<00:02:01.710> the<00:02:01.890> plane<00:02:02.189> and<00:02:02.549> I<00:02:02.939> can<00:02:03.180> select<00:02:03.420> for

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:04.380 
can go to the plane and I can select for

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:09.580 
can go to the plane and I can select for
example<00:02:04.469> two<00:02:05.430> vertices<00:02:06.500> and<00:02:07.500> I<00:02:08.489> can<00:02:08.789> create

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:09.590 
example two vertices and I can create

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.520 
example two vertices and I can create
constrain<00:02:10.590> its<00:02:11.580> typical<00:02:12.360> workflow

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:13.530 
constrain its typical workflow

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:16.760 
constrain its typical workflow
or<00:02:13.590> for<00:02:13.950> making<00:02:14.340> curtains<00:02:15.270> or<00:02:15.810> piece<00:02:16.260> of<00:02:16.290> cloth

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
or for making curtains or piece of cloth

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:21.020 
or for making curtains or piece of cloth
and<00:02:17.240> I<00:02:18.240> can<00:02:18.660> go<00:02:18.870> to<00:02:18.930> the<00:02:19.410> attribute<00:02:20.370> editor<00:02:20.459> for

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:21.030 
and I can go to the attribute editor for

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.910 
and I can go to the attribute editor for
this<00:02:21.270> and<00:02:21.569> cloth<00:02:21.990> and<00:02:22.940> set<00:02:23.940> up<00:02:24.120> some

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:24.920 
this and cloth and set up some

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.330 
this and cloth and set up some
attributes<00:02:25.920> to<00:02:26.280> make<00:02:26.490> it<00:02:26.670> not<00:02:26.880> so<00:02:27.319> stiff<00:02:28.340> for

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:29.340 
attributes to make it not so stiff for

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.660 
attributes to make it not so stiff for
example<00:02:29.730> I<00:02:29.910> can<00:02:30.200> reduce<00:02:31.200> the<00:02:31.530> reduced<00:02:31.980> did<00:02:32.459> you

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:32.670 
example I can reduce the reduced did you

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:38.990 
example I can reduce the reduced did you
the<00:02:33.120> resistance<00:02:33.560> attribute<00:02:34.560> and<00:02:35.090> see<00:02:38.000> some

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.000 
the resistance attribute and see some

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:46.660 
the resistance attribute and see some
nice<00:02:39.239> animation

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:46.670 

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:50.949 

so<00:02:47.270> the<00:02:47.660> my<00:02:47.810> idea<00:02:48.319> is<00:02:48.500> to<00:02:48.640> emit<00:02:49.640> particles<00:02:50.000> from

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:50.959 
so the my idea is to emit particles from

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:53.589 
so the my idea is to emit particles from
the<00:02:51.200> place<00:02:51.530> of<00:02:51.800> intersection<00:02:52.790> between<00:02:53.209> the

00:02:53.589 --> 00:02:53.599 
the place of intersection between the

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:57.670 
the place of intersection between the
plane<00:02:54.380> and<00:02:54.410> the<00:02:54.980> nodal<00:02:55.459> and<00:02:55.900> for<00:02:56.900> that<00:02:57.140> I<00:02:57.380> want

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:57.680 
plane and the nodal and for that I want

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.610 
plane and the nodal and for that I want
to<00:02:57.830> create<00:02:58.730> some<00:02:59.150> kind<00:02:59.330> of<00:02:59.510> object<00:02:59.840> between

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
to create some kind of object between

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.150 
to create some kind of object between
them<00:03:01.130> as<00:03:01.700> long<00:03:02.360> as<00:03:02.569> the<00:03:02.870> model<00:03:03.260> and<00:03:03.680> the<00:03:03.890> plane

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 
them as long as the model and the plane

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:08.080 
them as long as the model and the plane
are<00:03:04.970> polygonal<00:03:05.420> objects<00:03:06.050> I<00:03:06.230> cannot<00:03:06.680> use<00:03:07.100> nice

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
are polygonal objects I cannot use nice

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.140 
are polygonal objects I cannot use nice
NURBS<00:03:08.660> features<00:03:09.470> like<00:03:09.770> surface<00:03:10.520> intersect

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:11.150 
NURBS features like surface intersect

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:16.330 
NURBS features like surface intersect
and<00:03:11.440> so<00:03:12.440> on<00:03:12.640> but<00:03:13.870> in<00:03:14.870> Maya<00:03:15.410> we<00:03:15.739> have<00:03:15.950> a<00:03:15.980> very

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:16.340 
and so on but in Maya we have a very

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:21.190 
and so on but in Maya we have a very
nice<00:03:17.980> note<00:03:18.980> a<00:03:19.430> very<00:03:20.090> nice<00:03:20.390> feature<00:03:20.690> as<00:03:21.140> a

00:03:21.190 --> 00:03:21.200 
nice note a very nice feature as a

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:25.300 
nice note a very nice feature as a
scientific<00:03:22.130> stone<00:03:22.640> and<00:03:22.970> I<00:03:23.930> am<00:03:24.650> going<00:03:24.950> to<00:03:25.280> use

clearly<00:06:38.300> i<00:06:39.169> can<00:06:40.659> go<00:06:41.659> to<00:06:42.469> the<00:06:42.649> attribute<00:06:43.249> editor

00:06:43.619 --> 00:06:43.629 
clearly i can go to the attribute editor

00:06:43.629 --> 00:06:48.579 
clearly i can go to the attribute editor
for<00:06:44.629> the<00:06:44.749> emitter<00:06:45.289> and<00:06:45.819> first<00:06:46.819> i<00:06:47.149> want<00:06:48.110> to

00:06:48.579 --> 00:06:48.589 
for the emitter and first i want to

00:06:48.589 --> 00:06:53.430 
for the emitter and first i want to
let<00:06:49.249> the<00:06:49.459> speed<00:06:50.229> 20

00:06:59.280 --> 00:06:59.290 
to keep particles on place and to see

00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:03.270 
to keep particles on place and to see
particles<00:06:59.940> more<00:07:00.940> clearly<00:07:01.450> I<00:07:01.840> can<00:07:02.320> go<00:07:02.890> to<00:07:02.950> the

00:07:03.270 --> 00:07:03.280 
particles more clearly I can go to the

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:06.600 
particles more clearly I can go to the
particles<00:07:03.940> attribute<00:07:04.390> editor<00:07:04.800> and<00:07:05.800> make<00:07:06.250> them

particles attribute editor and make them

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:12.450 
particles attribute editor and make them
for<00:07:07.000> example<00:07:07.480> fears<00:07:08.050> and<00:07:08.640> set<00:07:09.640> up<00:07:11.460> smaller

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:12.460 
for example fears and set up smaller

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:19.680 
for example fears and set up smaller
radius<00:07:13.860> and<00:07:15.000> now<00:07:16.000> I<00:07:16.410> can<00:07:17.820> select<00:07:18.820> my<00:07:19.150> particles
