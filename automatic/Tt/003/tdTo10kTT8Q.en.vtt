definitely<00:00:40.110> pretty<00:00:40.350> pricey<00:00:40.879> but<00:00:41.879> ah<00:00:42.120> not<00:00:42.780> to

00:00:42.889 --> 00:00:42.899 
definitely pretty pricey but ah not to

definitely pretty pricey but ah not to
say<00:00:43.020> they<00:00:43.170> don't<00:00:43.260> have<00:00:43.440> good<00:00:43.620> compression

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:44.070 
say they don't have good compression

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.490 
say they don't have good compression
gear<00:00:44.250> but<00:00:44.879> it's<00:00:45.090> not<00:00:45.300> always<00:00:45.600> as<00:00:45.930> functional

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
gear but it's not always as functional

gear but it's not always as functional
as<00:00:46.530> you<00:00:46.680> might<00:00:46.829> think<00:00:46.860> i'm<00:00:47.300> compression<00:00:48.300> gear

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
as you might think i'm compression gear

as you might think i'm compression gear
is<00:00:48.719> actually<00:00:49.379> proven<00:00:49.710> to<00:00:49.829> enhance

00:00:50.029 --> 00:00:50.039 
is actually proven to enhance

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:51.680 
is actually proven to enhance
performance<00:00:50.430> and<00:00:50.940> i'll<00:00:51.149> talk<00:00:51.360> about<00:00:51.390> that<00:00:51.570> a

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
performance and i'll talk about that a

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:54.529 
performance and i'll talk about that a
little<00:00:51.780> bit<00:00:51.899> later<00:00:52.140> but<00:00:52.890> it's<00:00:53.699> become<00:00:54.030> more<00:00:54.480> of

00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:54.539 
little bit later but it's become more of

00:00:54.539 --> 00:00:56.660 
little bit later but it's become more of
a<00:00:54.660> fashion<00:00:54.989> accessory<00:00:55.590> rather<00:00:56.280> than<00:00:56.610> a

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
a fashion accessory rather than a

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.700 
a fashion accessory rather than a
functional<00:00:57.360> accessory<00:00:58.020> i<00:00:58.050> guess<00:00:58.260> i<00:00:58.379> could<00:00:58.440> say

00:00:58.700 --> 00:00:58.710 
functional accessory i guess i could say

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:00.619 
functional accessory i guess i could say
let<00:00:59.219> me<00:00:59.370> see<00:00:59.489> all<00:00:59.520> these<00:00:59.730> lightning<00:01:00.030> patterns

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629 
let me see all these lightning patterns

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:01.970 
let me see all these lightning patterns
these<00:01:00.870> muscle<00:01:01.289> patterns<00:01:01.620> i'm<00:01:01.739> sure<00:01:01.859> you<00:01:01.949> guys

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
these muscle patterns i'm sure you guys

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.830 
these muscle patterns i'm sure you guys
seen<00:01:02.219> them<00:01:02.370> in<00:01:02.460> the<00:01:02.520> store<00:01:02.730> before<00:01:02.940> really

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:03.840 
seen them in the store before really

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.359 
seen them in the store before really
fancy<00:01:04.229> looking<00:01:04.350> stuff<00:01:04.680> but<00:01:04.890> it's<00:01:05.010> really<00:01:05.159> not

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:05.369 
fancy looking stuff but it's really not

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:08.420 
fancy looking stuff but it's really not
all<00:01:05.580> that<00:01:05.990> functional<00:01:06.990> if<00:01:07.200> it's<00:01:07.530> not<00:01:07.680> fitted

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
all that functional if it's not fitted

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.910 
all that functional if it's not fitted
properly<00:01:09.049> that's<00:01:10.049> received<00:01:10.350> p<00:01:10.500> does<00:01:10.650> stuff<00:01:10.860> a

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:10.920 
properly that's received p does stuff a

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:11.929 
properly that's received p does stuff a
little<00:01:11.010> bit<00:01:11.189> different<00:01:11.460> just<00:01:11.580> to<00:01:11.670> talk<00:01:11.790> about

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
little bit different just to talk about

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.600 
little bit different just to talk about
how<00:01:12.119> compression<00:01:12.600> works<00:01:12.840> um<00:01:13.159> basically<00:01:14.159> it

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
how compression works um basically it

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:15.679 
how compression works um basically it
starts<00:01:14.760> with<00:01:15.000> your<00:01:15.150> muscles<00:01:15.509> and<00:01:15.600> your

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
starts with your muscles and your

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.480 
starts with your muscles and your
mustard<00:01:15.900> muscles<00:01:16.500> require<00:01:16.710> energy<00:01:17.040> to

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.490 
mustard muscles require energy to

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:20.120 
mustard muscles require energy to
perform<00:01:17.640> and<00:01:18.119> the<00:01:18.960> way<00:01:19.080> that<00:01:19.200> your<00:01:19.350> muscles

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
perform and the way that your muscles

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.219 
perform and the way that your muscles
produce<00:01:20.280> energy<00:01:20.610> is<00:01:20.909> through<00:01:21.090> oxygen<00:01:21.509> and<00:01:21.869> the

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
produce energy is through oxygen and the

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:23.420 
produce energy is through oxygen and the
only<00:01:22.320> way<00:01:22.470> for<00:01:22.619> your<00:01:22.710> muscles<00:01:22.979> to<00:01:23.070> get<00:01:23.220> oxygen

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
only way for your muscles to get oxygen

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.270 
only way for your muscles to get oxygen
is<00:01:23.939> through<00:01:24.630> your<00:01:24.659> bloodstream<00:01:25.020> so<00:01:25.890> basically

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
is through your bloodstream so basically

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.520 
is through your bloodstream so basically
what<00:01:26.460> compression<00:01:26.939> does<00:01:27.060> is<00:01:27.299> it<00:01:27.689> actually<00:01:27.750> is

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:28.530 
what compression does is it actually is

00:01:28.530 --> 00:01:31.870 
what compression does is it actually is
proven<00:01:28.950> to<00:01:29.100> improve<00:01:29.360> blood<00:01:30.360> flow<00:01:30.770> through

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:31.880 
proven to improve blood flow through

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.399 
proven to improve blood flow through
compressing<00:01:32.880> your<00:01:32.909> muscles<00:01:33.390> so<00:01:33.930> if<00:01:34.170> you<00:01:34.259> get

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
compressing your muscles so if you get

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:36.289 
compressing your muscles so if you get
more<00:01:34.619> blood<00:01:34.920> to<00:01:35.189> your<00:01:35.220> muscles<00:01:35.400> that<00:01:36.119> means

00:01:36.289 --> 00:01:36.299 
more blood to your muscles that means

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:37.399 
more blood to your muscles that means
you're<00:01:36.390> getting<00:01:36.509> more<00:01:36.689> oxygen<00:01:37.229> to<00:01:37.259> your

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:37.409 
you're getting more oxygen to your

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:38.840 
you're getting more oxygen to your
muscles<00:01:37.530> which<00:01:38.310> means<00:01:38.520> are<00:01:38.579> going<00:01:38.700> to<00:01:38.759> have

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
muscles which means are going to have

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.179 
muscles which means are going to have
more<00:01:39.000> energy<00:01:39.240> better<00:01:39.689> stamina<00:01:40.049> and<00:01:40.439> in<00:01:40.979> term

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
more energy better stamina and in term

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.850 
more energy better stamina and in term
perform<00:01:41.700> better<00:01:42.110> conversions<00:01:43.110> also<00:01:43.470> proven

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:43.860 
perform better conversions also proven

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.560 
perform better conversions also proven
to<00:01:44.040> stabilize<00:01:44.640> your<00:01:44.790> muscle<00:01:45.149> a<00:01:45.210> little<00:01:45.450> bit

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
to stabilize your muscle a little bit

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.810 
to stabilize your muscle a little bit
better<00:01:45.890> so<00:01:46.890> it's<00:01:47.009> not<00:01:47.040> going<00:01:47.250> to<00:01:47.340> move<00:01:47.490> as<00:01:47.670> much

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
better so it's not going to move as much

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.850 
better so it's not going to move as much
or<00:01:48.090> vibrate<00:01:48.540> I<00:01:48.570> guess<00:01:48.780> you<00:01:48.899> could<00:01:49.079> say<00:01:49.259> when

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
or vibrate I guess you could say when

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:51.830 
or vibrate I guess you could say when
you<00:01:49.979> are<00:01:50.130> performing<00:01:50.340> physical<00:01:50.970> activity<00:01:51.390> so

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
you are performing physical activity so

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.740 
you are performing physical activity so
it's<00:01:51.990> that's<00:01:52.950> not<00:01:53.430> only<00:01:53.549> going<00:01:53.729> to<00:01:53.820> improve

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
it's that's not only going to improve

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.660 
it's that's not only going to improve
blood<00:01:55.170> flow<00:01:55.290> but<00:01:55.890> it's<00:01:56.040> also<00:01:56.130> going<00:01:56.369> to<00:01:56.430> reduce

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:56.670 
blood flow but it's also going to reduce

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.609 
blood flow but it's also going to reduce
the<00:01:56.850> risk<00:01:57.000> of<00:01:57.119> injury<00:01:57.689> so<00:01:58.259> what<00:01:58.380> I<00:01:58.409> have<00:01:58.590> here

00:01:58.609 --> 00:01:58.619 
the risk of injury so what I have here

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:01.280 
the risk of injury so what I have here
is<00:01:58.770> the<00:01:58.950> CEP<00:01:59.549> compression<00:02:00.420> gear<00:02:00.600> you<00:02:01.049> probably

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
is the CEP compression gear you probably

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:02.749 
is the CEP compression gear you probably
never<00:02:01.469> heard<00:02:01.649> of<00:02:01.770> it<00:02:01.860> it's<00:02:02.040> very<00:02:02.310> popular

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:02.759 
never heard of it it's very popular

00:02:02.759 --> 00:02:04.399 
never heard of it it's very popular
amongst<00:02:02.969> like<00:02:03.240> triathletes<00:02:04.079> and<00:02:04.079> stuff

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
amongst like triathletes and stuff

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.089 
amongst like triathletes and stuff
runners<00:02:04.920> on<00:02:05.130> even<00:02:05.969> bikers<00:02:06.780> but<00:02:07.680> they<00:02:07.799> do<00:02:07.920> have

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
runners on even bikers but they do have

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:10.100 
runners on even bikers but they do have
all<00:02:08.340> it's<00:02:08.729> all<00:02:09.030> made<00:02:09.300> for<00:02:09.509> all<00:02:09.629> kinds<00:02:10.020> of

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.860 
all it's all made for all kinds of
sports<00:02:10.349> so<00:02:11.009> it's<00:02:11.129> a<00:02:11.190> really<00:02:11.510> depart<00:02:12.510> I<00:02:12.629> think<00:02:12.840> a

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
sports so it's a really depart I think a

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:14.010 
sports so it's a really depart I think a
lot<00:02:12.900> of<00:02:13.050> people<00:02:13.170> should<00:02:13.500> over

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:14.020 
lot of people should over

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:15.300 
lot of people should over
look<00:02:14.080> and<00:02:14.290> if<00:02:14.470> you<00:02:14.590> are<00:02:14.710> looking<00:02:14.890> to<00:02:15.070> really

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:15.310 
look and if you are looking to really

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:17.280 
look and if you are looking to really
improve<00:02:15.730> your<00:02:16.030> performance<00:02:16.150> not<00:02:17.020> just<00:02:17.200> from

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:17.290 
improve your performance not just from

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:18.630 
improve your performance not just from
your<00:02:17.440> shoes<00:02:17.740> it<00:02:18.040> that<00:02:18.190> they<00:02:18.370> claim<00:02:18.610> that

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:18.640 
your shoes it that they claim that

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.190 
your shoes it that they claim that
you're<00:02:18.910> going<00:02:19.000> to<00:02:19.060> be<00:02:19.120> faster<00:02:19.720> or<00:02:19.750> shoot<00:02:20.110> the

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
you're going to be faster or shoot the

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.720 
you're going to be faster or shoot the
ball<00:02:20.350> harder<00:02:20.710> because<00:02:21.100> obviously<00:02:21.310> that's

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730 
ball harder because obviously that's

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:24.360 
ball harder because obviously that's

what<00:02:27.820> I<00:02:27.850> have<00:02:28.030> here<00:02:28.060> is<00:02:28.240> the<00:02:28.450> compression

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
what I have here is the compression

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:30.720 
what I have here is the compression
sleeve<00:02:29.140> which<00:02:29.740> cost<00:02:29.950> about<00:02:30.040> forty<00:02:30.400> dollars

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:30.730 
sleeve which cost about forty dollars

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:33.090 
sleeve which cost about forty dollars
which<00:02:30.850> seems<00:02:31.060> a<00:02:31.150> little<00:02:31.450> bit<00:02:31.720> pricey<00:02:32.050> this<00:02:32.950> is

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.100 
which seems a little bit pricey this is

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.350 
which seems a little bit pricey this is
on<00:02:33.220> a<00:02:33.250> recovery<00:02:33.520> sleeve<00:02:33.970> or<00:02:34.090> anything<00:02:34.330> like

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:41.200 
is the CEP sleeve while it doesn't look

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.890 
is the CEP sleeve while it doesn't look
like<00:02:41.410> much<00:02:41.640> probably<00:02:42.640> on<00:02:42.760> camera<00:02:43.150> I<00:02:43.330> can

like much probably on camera I can
assure<00:02:44.140> you<00:02:44.350> I<00:02:44.470> tried<00:02:44.710> this<00:02:44.830> all<00:02:45.010> on<00:02:45.190> and<00:02:45.400> use

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:45.520 
assure you I tried this all on and use

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.580 
assure you I tried this all on and use
it<00:02:45.670> a<00:02:45.760> little<00:02:45.880> bit<00:02:46.090> and<00:02:46.600> I<00:02:46.990> can<00:02:47.110> achieve<00:02:47.320> I've

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
it a little bit and I can achieve I've

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:51.750 
it a little bit and I can achieve I've
never<00:02:48.040> tried<00:02:48.430> anything<00:02:48.850> like<00:02:49.060> this<00:02:49.420> before<00:02:50.760> it

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:51.760 
never tried anything like this before it

truly does compress really well and

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:55.470 
truly does compress really well and
you're<00:02:54.340> going<00:02:54.430> to<00:02:54.490> see<00:02:54.610> what<00:02:54.640> CEP<00:02:55.150> they<00:02:55.300> don't

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480 
you're going to see what CEP they don't

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.300 
you're going to see what CEP they don't
have<00:02:55.630> small<00:02:55.960> medium<00:02:55.990> and<00:02:56.560> large<00:02:56.620> and<00:02:57.040> extra

have small medium and large and extra

00:02:57.310 --> 00:02:59.190 
have small medium and large and extra
large<00:02:57.340> that's<00:02:58.150> another<00:02:58.420> sizing<00:02:58.900> work<00:02:59.050> the

00:02:59.190 --> 00:02:59.200 
large that's another sizing work the

large that's another sizing work the
sizing<00:02:59.620> works<00:02:59.650> based<00:03:00.580> on<00:03:00.990> the<00:03:02.040> based<00:03:03.040> on<00:03:03.190> the

sizing works based on the based on the
size<00:03:03.580> of<00:03:03.790> your<00:03:03.820> calves<00:03:04.150> so<00:03:04.810> you're<00:03:04.960> actually

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:05.050 
size of your calves so you're actually

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:07.350 
size of your calves so you're actually
going<00:03:05.290> to<00:03:05.380> see<00:03:05.470> the<00:03:05.560> sizes<00:03:05.890> if<00:03:06.010> you<00:03:06.100> up<00:03:06.310> if<00:03:06.760> you

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:07.360 
going to see the sizes if you up if you

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:08.640 
going to see the sizes if you up if you
are<00:03:07.390> looking<00:03:07.780> to<00:03:07.960> purchase<00:03:08.110> a<00:03:08.290> pair<00:03:08.470> you'll

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:08.650 
are looking to purchase a pair you'll

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:10.380 
are looking to purchase a pair you'll
see<00:03:08.740> that<00:03:08.860> sizes<00:03:09.250> are<00:03:09.400> not<00:03:09.550> small<00:03:10.090> medium

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:10.390 
see that sizes are not small medium

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.360 
see that sizes are not small medium
large<00:03:10.420> there<00:03:10.870> one<00:03:11.140> two<00:03:11.380> and<00:03:11.530> three<00:03:11.740> and<00:03:11.890> then

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:12.370 
large there one two and three and then

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.450 
large there one two and three and then
you'll<00:03:12.520> see<00:03:12.670> a<00:03:12.700> capsize<00:03:13.570> and<00:03:13.600> inches<00:03:14.460> so

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:15.460 
you'll see a capsize and inches so

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:18.660 
you'll see a capsize and inches so
there's<00:03:15.640> like<00:03:15.730> a<00:03:15.760> small<00:03:17.370> kind<00:03:18.370> of<00:03:18.459> small

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:18.670 
there's like a small kind of small

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:19.830 
there's like a small kind of small
increments<00:03:19.240> that<00:03:19.270> you<00:03:19.390> have<00:03:19.510> to<00:03:19.600> be<00:03:19.720> in

never experienced before in a socket it

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:23.820 
never experienced before in a socket it
actually<00:04:22.479> has<00:04:22.720> instructions<00:04:23.169> on<00:04:23.440> how<00:04:23.470> to<00:04:23.650> put

actually has instructions on how to put

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:24.870 
actually has instructions on how to put
it<00:04:23.919> on<00:04:24.010> which<00:04:24.160> I<00:04:24.280> thought<00:04:24.430> was<00:04:24.550> a<00:04:24.610> little<00:04:24.790> bit

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:24.880 
it on which I thought was a little bit

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:28.020 
it on which I thought was a little bit
funny<00:04:25.090> but<00:04:25.860> it<00:04:26.860> really<00:04:27.190> is<00:04:27.430> an

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:28.030 
funny but it really is an

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:29.850 
funny but it really is an
the<00:04:28.150> product<00:04:28.630> for<00:04:29.110> sixty<00:04:29.410> dollars<00:04:29.680> it's

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:29.860 
the product for sixty dollars it's

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:31.740 
the product for sixty dollars it's
definitely<00:04:30.250> I<00:04:30.310> think<00:04:30.400> it's<00:04:30.730> going<00:04:31.570> to<00:04:31.660> be

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:31.750 
definitely I think it's going to be

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:32.910 
definitely I think it's going to be
something<00:04:31.990> that<00:04:32.170> you<00:04:32.320> should<00:04:32.470> look<00:04:32.560> at<00:04:32.740> if<00:04:32.830> you

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:32.920 
something that you should look at if you

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:34.470

have issues with cramping or anything
like<00:04:34.510> that<00:04:34.630> this<00:04:35.350> is<00:04:35.500> really<00:04:35.650> going<00:04:35.889> to<00:04:35.950> help

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:36.070

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:39.070

you and then this is the compression
short<00:04:39.310> that<00:04:39.490> the<00:04:40.090> retails<00:04:40.419> for<00:04:40.510> about<00:04:40.660> a

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:40.750 
short that the retails for about a

00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:43.650 
short that the retails for about a
hundred<00:04:40.960> dollars<00:04:42.120> it's<00:04:43.120> hard<00:04:43.270> to<00:04:43.330> show<00:04:43.480> on<00:04:43.600> the
