think if you have never tried you never

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.630 
think if you have never tried you never
know<00:00:42.660> and<00:00:43.020> so<00:00:43.440> that's<00:00:43.829> that's<00:00:44.129> what<00:00:44.399> I<00:00:44.489> was

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:44.640 
know and so that's that's what I was

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:47.540 
know and so that's that's what I was
safe<00:00:44.820> do<00:00:45.090> is<00:00:45.270> continue<00:00:45.719> to<00:00:46.100> chase<00:00:47.100> what<00:00:47.399> you

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:48.729 

be<00:03:46.550> successful<00:03:47.180> I<00:03:47.209> think<00:03:47.269> the<00:03:47.599> person<00:03:47.840> who<00:03:48.200> is

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:52.970 
a character and I think that's not just

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:55.570 
a character and I think that's not just
about<00:03:53.180> a<00:03:53.239> lot<00:03:53.510> because<00:03:53.810> of<00:03:53.870> light<00:03:54.340> things<00:03:55.340> like
