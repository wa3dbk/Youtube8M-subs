00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:11.250
 If so, is passive house construction applicable only to single-family homes ? 

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:18.029
 It was the world's first passive technique to create a painful withdrawal. 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:22.910
 Rooftop solar panel 8th floor 15 year old Vegas will produce 80% on deployment 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:22.910
 It is a high energy apartment with a high energy insulation energy . 

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:35.579
 For the most part, about 80% of the houses in Korea are newly 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:41.370
 It's built so you can save as much energy as you can in your apartment . 

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:47.280
 To present that facial expression model in such a form 

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:49.440
 We manage the type of yacht of the two passive houses of the scale of eight hundred eight floors 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:55.170
 To 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:57.180
 The apartment also six months nopyeotgo rot on the wall with a variety of single 1g 4 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:02.510
 Midway to the underground insulation glass 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:02.510
 Highly confidential window system minimizes heat loss 

00:01:03.119 --> 00:01:11.820
 The biggest technical difficulties with guns 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:14.939
 Apartments have an external wall insulation to get existing apartment only put the insulation inside 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:18.420
 I installed insulation on the outside 8 floors. 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:22.500
 We have to try several new methods 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:28.649
 This apartment, named Zero Carbon Grid Body, was completed in June. 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:33.350
 Demonstrate various expressions ranging from 11 pyeong to 25 pyeong . 

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:33.350
 We are monitoring energy usage . 

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:42.939
 a preferential price a buyer is both weak 50cm around doeguyo its General House 

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:48.819
 I have about twice as thick 

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:52.270
 Oh, and because there is more than about 20cm of insulation outside 

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:56.890
 That's how the wall becomes a two-braid situation. 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:59.530
 External words were reinforced with 4 external insulation facing towards the normal wall 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:04.899
 It's about 51 to 70mm. 

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:07.310
 Hey et insulation wall is the thickness of the heat insulating material in the weak 200 to 251 zero 

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:12.040
 You'll have it. 

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:17.439
 You can see walls that are much thicker than traditional apartments. 

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:22.209
 Here's the glass, I installed five gaps with five gaps So er, 

00:02:17.439 --> 00:02:27.670
 The heat loss is reduced by about a third to be added. 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:30.879
 You can check Yogi Yoonhee once . 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:36.550
 Because the exception is installed as a trapped trap 

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:41.319
 Ada is made up of structures that can certainly reduce performance 

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:42.519
 Special glass installed in Ujung is doing the explanation depends on the level of 80% Walls 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:47.260
 There is 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:48.640
 Passive 0 to reduce energy usage by more than 80% compared to existing apartments 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:53.349
 Apartment 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:55.799
 Beginning in 2017, these passive methods will be elegant when building buildings. 

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:55.799
 The expected
