00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:11.250
 hello my dear friends and warmly 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.139
 Welcome to a new video 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.990
 my channel gmx.de today only one 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.580
 short video because it works 

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.960
 after a long time, again a question 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.160
 Answer video for those who do not 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.689
 know is actually already in the 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.460
 names so it is already on the name of her 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:25.439
 I can ask big ones again 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.300
 and then I'll give you one 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.710
 separate video answer the last 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.560
 I think that I last time 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.899
 year sometime I believe 

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:35.309
 october and november i do not know 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.730

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.050
 role 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.059
 In any case, you see in the background 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.800
 just a speed art from the designer 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:42.450
 he created the new youtube avatar 

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.770
 means recognized as crash that is not 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.420
 German so not in German now 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.820
 sometime write you also manufactures 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.230
 In any case, yes , I wanted to quickly 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:50.550
 reward any case for being so 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.350
 did a great job by 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.370
 I show it here in the video 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.719
 to be left and can as on 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.280

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:58.109

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:00.390
 in love is a blatant designer and 

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:02.219
 look at that one you can get one 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:03.750
 Abo da will definitely be very 

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:05.460
 nice and yes what's great too 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.530
 the questions of video say you can 

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:08.700
 just now here under this video like that 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:10.409
 we are asking you many questions 

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.659
 simply does not matter how many 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:15.000
 everyone poses for himself and I will 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.229
 try in a separate video all 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.369
 to answer questions 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:18.900
 repeat if that logically 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.909
 do not take it so if now 

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.530
 Example 20 times in it is how old you are 

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:24.000
 you will answer again 

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.740
 So be sure to stick to it 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.110
 that it did not repeat so many 

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.280
 ask and yes before you ask 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:30.750
 you can already imagine the old one 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.189
 Watch the old question 

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.540
 Answer video where I have a few 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.939
 maybe answered questions 

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:37.590
 the video then answers quickly 

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.759
 current questions from you if not then 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.229
 writes these questions in any case the 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:41.640
 comments and I would say then 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.299
 Let's see ourselves in the answer video again 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:44.299
