00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
it for some weird reason maybe because

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.490 
it for some weird reason maybe because
it<00:00:14.400> was<00:00:14.429> just<00:00:15.299> like<00:00:15.540> you<00:00:15.630> know<00:00:15.660> how<00:00:15.929> I<00:00:16.230> haven't

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
got oh right and once I record something

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:21.560 
got oh right and once I record something
like<00:00:19.109> I<00:00:19.350> never<00:00:19.590> record<00:00:20.100> live<00:00:20.430> I<00:00:20.760> just<00:00:20.939> drag<00:00:21.359> my

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
like I never record live I just drag my

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.540 
like I never record live I just drag my
recording<00:00:22.260> to<00:00:22.800> where<00:00:22.949> I<00:00:22.980> wanted<00:00:23.220> to<00:00:23.279> record

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:23.550 
recording to where I wanted to record

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.310 
recording to where I wanted to record
and<00:00:23.970> then<00:00:24.029> I<00:00:24.090> hit<00:00:24.300> record<00:00:24.630> and<00:00:24.840> then<00:00:24.990> I<00:00:25.080> stopped

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
and then I hit record and then I stopped

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.679 
and then I hit record and then I stopped
it<00:00:25.500> and<00:00:25.619> then<00:00:25.769> I<00:00:26.010> don't<00:00:26.550> title<00:00:26.939> my<00:00:27.060> recordings

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:27.689
