00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:47.310 
people to easily get them out when they

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:49.430 
people to easily get them out when they
lose<00:01:47.580> their<00:01:47.849> key<00:01:48.119> or<00:01:48.360> the<00:01:48.390> key<00:01:48.810> worn<00:01:49.110> won't

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:49.440
