00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:03.380
 ah 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:14.170
 hello friends welcome to an episode 

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:16.299
 more abracadabra the cheat section and 

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:18.009
 floreados dotcom today let's see how 

00:00:16.299 --> 00:00:19.540
 make a little more attractive the 

00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:21.610
 favorites that we have saved in 

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:24.960
 safari you know that every time you open a 

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:27.390
 new tab in safari 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.009
 the favorites are shown as you see 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.259
 I have ordered my favorites in 

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:33.090
 folders so they do not mix by 

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:35.070
 example I have a folder for sports 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:37.860
 I have a folder for technology in 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.530
 general and another for blogs which Apel 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.870
 more consulted is this then to me 

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:45.120
 I'd like you to just show the content 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.449
 of this folder every time you open a 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:50.309
 new screen in safari or gave it to the 

00:00:48.449 --> 00:00:52.739
 address bar with this option 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.989
 we can also see the icons of all 

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:57.570
 our webs much more colorful 

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.340
 and getting it is very simple you will see what 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.679
 The only thing we have to do is to enter 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.559
 adjustments we go to the adjustments of 

00:01:01.679 --> 00:01:06.479
 safari and on safari we give to the 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.850
 Preferred eyelash you see here 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:10.679
 now he is showing us all the 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.899
 folders that we have created and the only thing 

00:01:10.679 --> 00:01:16.450
 what we have to do is choose one and 

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:18.759
 you will see the change back to the safari 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:21.070
 and now he's only showing me the 

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:23.200
 content that I have in the blogs folder 

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.689
 of apple but as you can see a lot way 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.520
 most striking shows all the icons 

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:29.860
 with the logos of favorite blogs 

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:32.049
 also with this view we can change the 

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:33.850
 order of the icons exactly the same 

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:35.110
 that if we change the order of 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:37.539
 applications that we have in the 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:40.509
 springboard you will see only you have to touch 

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:44.830
 and pressing down is highlighted and you can 

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:48.130
 move the icon to where os wins 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:50.500
 as you see a much simpler and 

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:52.510
 much more colorful to see your favorites 

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:55.420
 in safari now I want to show you a 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:58.480
 extra a little good trick there 

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:01.060
 Many people who got involved tied me to the 

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:03.130
 time to browse the websites with the 

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.320
 buttons and the address bar of 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:07.930
 safari you know that when we started 

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:10.690
 navigate disappear the bar 

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:12.490
 directions and the buttons below to 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:15.160
 Well then I get them I'm a 

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:18.160
 speed up releasing the screen when 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:20.290
 you did it up but it can be 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.990
 that you are seeing something interesting that 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.459
 you want to share and do not want to move 

00:02:22.990 --> 00:02:26.470
 the screen neither up nor towards 

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:28.780
 down in that case the only thing you have 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:30.490
 what to do is to touch just above the 

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:32.650
