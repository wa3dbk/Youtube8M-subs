00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:07.420
 we go now to what we came to that 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:07.420
 we live 

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:17.360
 with the style and the me we are was average 

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:25.000
 confused and yes and you had said 

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:25.000
 barometer that if Wednesday's paper 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:37.010
 hector that was today at 9 and 21 if what 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.010
 temperature had 82 

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:44.640
 With all due respect changing barometer 

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:46.739
 new ladies and gentlemen all over the world 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:48.540
 thanks to all the foristas of 

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:59.449
 facebook to the people of the writings at 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:01:07.580
 email because naughty hÃ©ctor put to 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:07.580
 talk about yesterday 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.100
 with it at the temperature 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:23.410
 atmospheric temperature is measured with a 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.950
 barometer a barometer the body with 

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:25.950
 a thermometer 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:31.110
 that's not so this the naughty 

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:40.000
 still the temperature is of the body or 

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:43.090
 of the food environment that is in the 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.920
 oven is measured with a thermometer ok ok 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.960
 Of course there are several types of 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.729
 thermometer for different uses clear 

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:50.830
 but we do not use to measure the temperature 

00:01:48.729 --> 00:01:55.720
 of the environment the same type of telmo 

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:57.220
 metro that we put the cucu baby 

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.560
 thermometer takes measurements of the 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:02.290
 temperature in degrees fahrenheit celsius 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.630
 either of the temperature from from the 

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:08.640
 air whatever the barometer around 

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:14.440
 the atmospheric pressure that 's right 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:17.860
 in the graph of the graph until the 

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:20.930
 graph and if it was the time ok that is the 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:23.849
 thermometer or instrument case 

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.500
 and the barometer that is next to it so that 

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:28.040
 instruments are used to measure the 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.040
 atmospheric pressure 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:35.760
 he tells her first of all the day 

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.500
 the group that was on Wednesday originated 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.980
 to deny yesterday that on Wednesday 4 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.769
 July 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:43.349
 that day I said first thermometer and 

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:45.840
 discounts and the barometer time because 

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:49.500
 there are many people who call it a barometer 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:52.579
 the thermometer many people many 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:55.470
 people of many people are many 

00:02:52.579 --> 00:02:57.780
 many people tell you 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:02.720
 the two things have thermometer the 

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:02.720
 correct word would be a thermos copied 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:07.950
 it's the word 

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:18.180
 and that was invented that is confusing 

00:03:15.719 --> 00:03:20.010
 is correct what happens what happens is 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:22.739
 that in the barometer is not for the 

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:24.870
 Hector temperature hear me is the 

00:03:22.739 --> 00:03:27.150
 thermometer I said it first but there 

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:31.250
 people who say the same to you in the end 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.250
 chiringays the thread or the string 

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:38.420
 and then I said barometer but I looked 

00:03:35.969 --> 00:03:41.880
 I agree 

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:46.129
 and I ask for forgiveness 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:50.610
 the expected sir 

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:54.560
 I apologize to those people who have 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:54.560
 said that I'm wrong is right 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.760
 have to put up with pressure 

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:08.500
 I have no problem with that for me nor 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:12.329
 I am his they raffled investigate 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:12.329
 just in case
