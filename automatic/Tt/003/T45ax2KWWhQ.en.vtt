00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:34.140 
needs we make everything so we'll make
the<00:01:31.030> hood<00:01:31.479> bumpers<00:01:31.900> the<00:01:32.140> pedal<00:01:32.470> pad<00:01:32.650> so<00:01:33.130> we<00:01:33.760> are

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:34.150 
the hood bumpers the pedal pad so we are

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:36.270 
the hood bumpers the pedal pad so we are
car<00:01:34.420> guys<00:01:34.450> too<00:01:34.960> so<00:01:35.590> we<00:01:35.710> know<00:01:35.860> that<00:01:35.890> when<00:01:36.190> you

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:36.280 
car guys too so we know that when you

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:37.800 
car guys too so we know that when you
seal<00:01:36.490> up<00:01:36.520> your<00:01:36.640> car<00:01:36.909> you<00:01:37.060> want<00:01:37.240> everything<00:01:37.690> you

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
seal up your car you want everything you

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:39.030 
seal up your car you want everything you
just<00:01:37.840> don't<00:01:38.200> want<00:01:38.380> part<00:01:38.680> of<00:01:38.740> it

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:39.040 
just don't want part of it

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.130 
just don't want part of it
so<00:01:39.340> we<00:01:40.000> think<00:01:40.150> that<00:01:40.240> makes<00:01:40.510> us<00:01:40.659> kind<00:01:40.840> of<00:01:40.900> unique

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:41.140 
so we think that makes us kind of unique

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.080 
so we think that makes us kind of unique
and<00:01:41.530> that's<00:01:41.770> probably<00:01:42.070> an<00:01:42.490> important<00:01:42.909> thing

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:43.090 
and that's probably an important thing

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:44.520 
and that's probably an important thing
to<00:01:43.240> do<00:01:43.390> because<00:01:43.750> there's<00:01:43.900> a<00:01:43.990> lot<00:01:44.110> of<00:01:44.260> us<00:01:44.380> that

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:44.530 
to do because there's a lot of us that

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:45.840 
to do because there's a lot of us that
don't<00:01:44.710> realize<00:01:45.070> until<00:01:45.250> it<00:01:45.460> down<00:01:45.549> the<00:01:45.729> road

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:45.850 
don't realize until it down the road

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:47.610 
don't realize until it down the road
that<00:01:46.090> man<00:01:46.360> I<00:01:46.390> really<00:01:46.780> need<00:01:46.930> that<00:01:46.990> little<00:01:47.320> part

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:47.620 
that man I really need that little part

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:48.899 
that man I really need that little part

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:48.909 
right there where do I go

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:50.550 
right there where do I go

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:50.560 
that's exactly right especially here at

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:51.899 
that's exactly right especially here at
this<00:01:50.770> show<00:01:50.920> you<00:01:50.979> see<00:01:51.190> all<00:01:51.310> these<00:01:51.400> great<00:01:51.580> cars

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:53.890 
and they've got killer interiors they

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.430 
and they've got killer interiors they
put<00:01:54.220> thousands<00:01:54.820> of<00:01:54.909> dollars<00:01:54.970> into<00:01:55.390> the<00:01:56.049> stereo

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:56.440 
put thousands of dollars into the stereo

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.710 
put thousands of dollars into the stereo
equipment<00:01:56.500> or<00:01:57.159> or<00:01:57.490> into<00:01:57.820> the<00:01:57.909> upholstery<00:01:58.450> and

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:58.720 
equipment or or into the upholstery and

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.109 
equipment or or into the upholstery and
then<00:01:59.470> the<00:01:59.619> rubber<00:02:00.280> seems<00:02:00.670> to<00:02:00.760> be<00:02:00.880> the<00:02:00.970> last

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:01.119 
then the rubber seems to be the last

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:02.399 
then the rubber seems to be the last
thing<00:02:01.330> they<00:02:01.390> think<00:02:01.659> of<00:02:01.780> well<00:02:01.930> that's<00:02:02.140> what's

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:02.409 
thing they think of well that's what's

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:03.899 
thing they think of well that's what's
protecting<00:02:02.920> it<00:02:03.040> that's<00:02:03.220> keeping<00:02:03.430> the<00:02:03.670> wind

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:03.909 
protecting it that's keeping the wind

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:06.630 
protecting it that's keeping the wind
the<00:02:04.240> dirt<00:02:04.540> the<00:02:04.930> air<00:02:05.110> the<00:02:05.830> moisture<00:02:06.280> out<00:02:06.310> of<00:02:06.460> the

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:06.640 
the dirt the air the moisture out of the

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:08.639 
the dirt the air the moisture out of the
car<00:02:06.820> so<00:02:07.150> it's<00:02:07.630> kind<00:02:07.810> of<00:02:07.869> silly<00:02:08.049> not<00:02:08.349> to<00:02:08.379> think

00:02:08.639 --> 00:02:08.649 
car so it's kind of silly not to think

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:10.199 
car so it's kind of silly not to think
about<00:02:08.769> the<00:02:09.009> rubber<00:02:09.189> I<00:02:09.459> mean<00:02:09.849> if<00:02:09.939> you<00:02:10.030> want<00:02:10.179> to

about the rubber I mean if you want to

00:02:10.209 --> 00:02:11.670 
about the rubber I mean if you want to
keep<00:02:10.360> that<00:02:10.479> thing<00:02:10.539> nice<00:02:10.869> you<00:02:11.049> got<00:02:11.140> to<00:02:11.290> do<00:02:11.560> up

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:11.680

00:02:13.229 --> 00:02:13.239 
the rubber right it's exactly right it

00:02:13.239 --> 00:02:15.420 
the rubber right it's exactly right it
keeps<00:02:13.420> the<00:02:13.569> value<00:02:13.930> in<00:02:14.110> the<00:02:14.200> car<00:02:14.409> so<00:02:14.739> it's<00:02:15.010> again

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
keeps the value in the car so it's again

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.580 
keeps the value in the car so it's again
it's<00:02:15.700> it<00:02:16.209> may<00:02:16.360> not<00:02:16.480> be<00:02:16.629> the<00:02:16.750> sexiest<00:02:17.170> part<00:02:17.349> here
