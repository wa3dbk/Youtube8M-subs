00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:02.700
 but 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:16.379
 0 punctuation 

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:17.910
 review on the set so we draw 3d write on 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:19.230
 this week played the game name 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:24.180
 which is translated as a medal for 

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:25.560
 bravery war fighter and sometimes gradually 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.000
 changing the name of the group least advance 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:28.890
 video yet does not sound very well 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.990
 foolishly can my ability doha 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.879
 trimmed not on you understood war fighter 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:34.980
 because he is a fighter in a tax war 

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:36.540
 he is filled with his sidekick figure accountant 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.220
 those whom I know the death of the yard laughed 

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.810
 when they heard this stupid method 

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.400
 why none of the developers did not 

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:42.930
 made a remark or slave seal 

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.700
 electronic or for such give one hundred blows 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.170
 whip can then just checked 

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.790
 employee attentive and went 

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:49.649
 too far let's do one more 

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:52.680
 fucking realistic war shooter 

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:54.930
 still don't want let's call him a war fighter 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:56.700
 brought the idea and then I thought come on 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.260
 I'll stick this whole cake in your prick and 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.969
 thousands of people went to eat my blood from 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.770
 nose and maybe it is focused 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.510
 marketing did not know what is the name 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.040
 laugh at everyone except those who have consciousness 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.610
 less developed than a bowl of fried 

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.170
 tripe 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.729
 and fortunately it is the only fucking people 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:11.969
 who will like this game so here 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.409
 war fighter go now seriously then 

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:14.909
 very serious playing few people 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:16.499
 dying well then there are a lot of foreigners 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.240
 dying this we already went through all this 

00:01:16.499 --> 00:01:19.679
 shnyagu modern war and they are plenty 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.450
 have fun using words 

00:01:19.679 --> 00:01:23.369
 realistic not to destination but then 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.229
 come stakov make and showed how 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:26.939
 together this genre shows on cruel 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.770
 paranoid numeric attacks 

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:30.270
 you should have shameful cavities mom 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.100
 caught you when you were at night 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.409
 cookies you can just eat cookies 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.359
 further but no war the fighter personifies 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:38.249
 all that makes modern shooters so 

00:01:36.359 --> 00:01:39.509
 liber visual plot all the time 

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:41.310
 threw me from location to location 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.319
 told me to love all brown people 

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.929
 speaking an incomprehensible language and did not know 

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:47.279
 who they are and what they deserve for sure 

00:01:45.929 --> 00:01:49.109
 knew that they were not far behind us 

00:01:47.279 --> 00:01:50.579
 technological in one mission you are given 

00:01:49.109 --> 00:01:52.319
 for the sake of a controlled robot that comes in 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.490
 to the enemy in the rear and in the fall is not like grass yet 

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:55.169
 someone does not turn it over 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:56.669
 breaks the camera with stones it says it all 

00:01:55.169 --> 00:01:59.219
 that it is necessary to know not whether we 

00:01:56.669 --> 00:02:01.919
 killer robots they have stones we are imperial 

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:03.630
 stormtroopers that arrange genocide and vocals 

00:02:01.919 --> 00:02:04.919
 and help to be able to tolerate the ethics of it 

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.569
 if only it was an interesting game 

00:02:04.919 --> 00:02:08.009
 but like them and shooters about modern war 

00:02:06.569 --> 00:02:09.780
 if the game was played by a person possessing 

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.610
 self-aware then the developers thought that 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:12.900
 tobacco stuck this kid we said 

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.190
 mate but did not notice the boy 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:16.080
 to whom they say also he said too 

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.760
 late and did it myself kid 

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.160
 the turret which neatly managed with 

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.810
 the flanks was killed nipam while I was aiming 3 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.700
 the sniper full edition were 

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.620
 bombed in the field with rockets launched 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.960
 most likely the punishing finger of the Lord 

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.280
 what the fuck did I forget here asked her myself 

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:31.080
 when I once again unwittingly 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:32.880
 abstracted from the battle and all the shots and 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.710
 cries mingled noise like a giant 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.200
 Volodya on my head this game is not 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:39.060
 wants my presence she wants people 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.060
 who do not think that war is a fighter 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.710
 wacky name by the way whom is war fighter so 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:45.480
 that did not stop at half an hour 

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:47.100
 didn't stop put gamepads off 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.450
 game because won too little 

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:50.490
 neurons that are ready so here once 

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.410
 waste then I played doom 3 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:54.120
 bfg edition which also came out on 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:55.709
 last week is much better 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.870
 shooter at least where there is likely 

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:59.459
 It means a loot fig check Aide see 

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:00.780
 working on doom 4 because they 

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:02.430
 had fun earlier well now and 

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.050
 the owners of the cat so that they earn big 

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:05.490
 bag loot to pay them does not tolerate 

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:07.350
 First you need to make sure that people in general 

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:09.180
 remember what doom is except sound 

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:11.130
 which publishes silly and bass barrel 

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.660
 so in this movie which calls 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.770
 yourself remaster us that very funny 

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.180
 now you can hold a flashlight 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:17.160
 simultaneously with another weapon on the same 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.900
 it give historical revisionism well 

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.370
 yes it is strange that no Space Marines never 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.720
 guessed to use electrical tape or 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:23.519
 just simply lit a flashlight 

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:25.800
 massive pectoral muscles it was 

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:27.780
 part of the game I'm sure that many levels 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.580
 were specially made dark themselves 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.470
 memorable thing about house three is that 

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:33.300
 that he was black as antlers raxco I 

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:34.790
 postsilt to armpit Barry White all 

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:36.540
 other countries and design solutions 

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:37.800
 canned sweat bar jacks 

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.570
 this special edition is kind of 

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:41.160
 abnormal Ragdoll physics that when 

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:43.200
 Doctors corpses in bark penitent 

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.519
 airships or lousy sound design where 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.680
 machine sounds like a game card 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:48.570
 prisobachit bicycle wheel gun at 

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.950
 puppy robot pussy spewing brake 

00:03:48.570 --> 00:03:51.180
 fluid and loading time so much 

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:53.130
 huge that lagging behind coming up 

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.600
 terrible taxes and like the previous know 

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:55.980
 when doom 3 just came out was not him 

00:03:54.600 --> 00:03:57.570
 low opinion because he has gone far 

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.100
 from the bright characteristic of the original 

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:00.900
 other eggs on top with their gray 

00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:02.640
 tones of narrow corridors and endless 

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.959
 audio diaries from the right people who 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:04.800
 lost in the way of auditions for 

00:04:03.959 --> 00:04:06.930
 system shock 2 

00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:08.790
 but how naive young I seem 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:10.830
 yourself for thinking that doom 3 is setting 

00:04:08.790 --> 00:04:12.570
 bad direction to the genre when to play 

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:14.790
 doom 3 to rest after the game 

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:16.650
 war is a fighter for now and because up to 

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:18.690
 you make a sudden strong context i 

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:20.549
 lonely mark i am such demons from 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:21.359
 hell or I can kill demons because 

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:22.950
 Mudaki theme 

00:04:21.359 --> 00:04:24.419
 I know that is not music because 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:26.070
 decided to chalk jump and wardrobes try 

00:04:24.419 --> 00:04:28.330
 extract my calf across my armpits 

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:29.919
 I do not invade from the giant army 

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:31.449
 goals pastel for some reason 100 meters from 

00:04:29.919 --> 00:04:32.830
 me what can be a demon 

00:04:31.449 --> 00:04:34.449
 while some all-seeing demiurge 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:35.889
 the warden does not proclaim that I can 

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:37.719
 go on shooting next 

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:39.310
 locality instead and in the corridor and on 

00:04:37.719 --> 00:04:41.289
 paths of monsters I can go further 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:42.759
 when there is no monster on the way you know 

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:44.650
 that really shocked me and 

00:04:42.759 --> 00:04:46.240
 shelling pointing where to go so 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:47.770
 if i am of course the locked door 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.750
 must in an organic mannerist key in 

00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:52.479
 surrounded without direct instructions and means 

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:55.090
 what did it take away from the game fucking i 

00:04:52.479 --> 00:04:56.439
 I assume that she is a fighter to bore me 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:58.240
 because after i gave 

00:04:56.439 --> 00:04:59.919
 battlefield 3 modern warfare 3 rank 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:01.389
 two lords at lifletov with rectal mountains 

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:03.550
 do not agree did not accept my opinion 

00:05:01.389 --> 00:05:04.360
 seriously because I'm supposedly just not 

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:06.729
 I love shooters 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:08.979

 castrated themselves with my sphincter myself 

00:05:08.979 --> 00:05:12.310

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:14.349
 first movie about you snotty hiding in 

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:16.000
 shelters corrective scandals you don't even 

00:05:14.349 --> 00:05:17.680
 you know what something is 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.180
 quickly and around necessarily and quickly 

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:20.590
 reacted on iraq jump one of 

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:21.940

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:24.729
 hung cool hat

 it is not riding on the conveyor to 

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:28.300
 next shelter where you fall asleep 

00:05:26.349 --> 00:05:30.759

 resistance 3 we call shooters oliver

 for example pis pis sperm bread i 

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:42.759
