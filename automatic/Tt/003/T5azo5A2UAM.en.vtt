00:00:01.609 --> 00:00:04.609
 I don't like it or not 

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:07.840
 Recently I listened to people's performances 

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:11.720
 There is one thing in common among those that I think is a good performance 

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.529
 Discovered that 

00:00:14.529 --> 00:00:16.189
 In a word 

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:18.779
 It is a pulse of a branch note 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.970
 I am attracted to the performance that makes me feel the pulse of a strong branch note 

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:25.249
 Seems to be 

00:00:25.249 --> 00:00:29.210
 It leads to the rhythm and the heart beat sound facility when walking 

00:00:29.209 --> 00:00:31.579
 There may be 

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:34.909
 Or when you play a simple pattern 

00:00:34.909 --> 00:00:35.920
 Even when 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.920
 Always feel this pulse in your body 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:44.040
 The pulse to those who play together and those who are listening to the performance 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.940
 One who can communicate 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.010
 First of all, it is necessary to become a good drama 

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:55.810
 Recently, a lot of information about drums has been added and various teaching materials 

00:00:55.810 --> 00:00:57.640
 Is now available 

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.220
 They ride on the pulse of firm and distributed 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:03.880
 It will be meaningful for the first time 

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:06.590
 Please review your own performance again 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:09.150
 Please give me 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.210
 I have been interested in the drum trigger system for several years 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:14.960
 I use for 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.910
 Vibration that struck the drum 

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:18.780
 Pick up with a pickup microphone 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.409
 Various by converting it to a midi signal 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:25.560
 I can ring a big job 

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.979
 It is completely different from synchronized playing with tapes and rearing agents 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.290
 Thing 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:34.150
 The synchronization performance is limited to the click time, 

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.250
 The trigger system is generally 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:40.450
 You can build a installation 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.580
 So here's my drum instruction video 

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:48.540
 The material of bs9t grade included in the first methanol royal family 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.840
 Let's explain the actual setup 

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:25.190
 The top pad is the switch and if you hit it 

00:03:25.189 --> 00:03:27.069
 Setup changes 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:29.349
 There were three setups now 

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:32.349
 So let's keep them going 

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:39.759
 f 

00:04:28.289 --> 00:04:31.349
 The drum trigger system is never a big deal 

00:04:31.349 --> 00:04:32.779
 Not 

00:04:32.779 --> 00:04:36.550
 It is not this small one that I use 

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:40.220
 In addition, it is interesting because the operation is not difficult at all 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:43.220
 Please check once by all means if you have 

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:47.490
 Well then, finally I'm solo with the trigger system 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:50.159
 I want to say goodbye to the music 

00:04:50.159 --> 00:04:51.799
 See you again somewhere
