00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:06.600 
okay now that you've gotten the top two

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.049 
okay now that you've gotten the top two
layers<00:00:06.839> done<00:00:07.350> now<00:00:08.340> you're<00:00:08.550> going<00:00:08.670> to<00:00:08.760> work<00:00:08.910> on

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:09.059 
layers done now you're going to work on

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:11.480 
layers done now you're going to work on
the<00:00:09.179> corners<00:00:09.740> and<00:00:10.740> when<00:00:11.040> you're<00:00:11.160> done<00:00:11.309> with

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:11.490 
the corners and when you're done with

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:13.820 
the corners and when you're done with
the<00:00:11.580> corners<00:00:12.000> your<00:00:12.269> work<00:00:12.480> on<00:00:12.719> just<00:00:13.469> the<00:00:13.620> four

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:13.830 
the corners your work on just the four

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.700 
the corners your work on just the four
edges<00:00:14.009> and<00:00:14.400> then<00:00:14.490> you're<00:00:14.700> done<00:00:15.320> so<00:00:16.320> let's

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
edges and then you're done so let's

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:22.790 
edges and then you're done so let's
check<00:00:16.949> out<00:00:17.130> the<00:00:17.160> bottom<00:00:17.850> corners

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.429 

and<00:00:23.460> you<00:00:23.580> want<00:00:23.759> to<00:00:23.849> find<00:00:24.060> them<00:00:24.330> with<00:00:25.140> if

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
and you want to find them with if

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.409 
and you want to find them with if
they're<00:00:25.679> in<00:00:25.859> place<00:00:26.130> don't<00:00:26.970> worry<00:00:27.150> about

00:00:27.409 --> 00:00:27.419 
they're in place don't worry about

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:28.669 
they're in place don't worry about
whether<00:00:27.630> or<00:00:27.750> not<00:00:27.990> they're<00:00:28.199> turned<00:00:28.439> the<00:00:28.560> right

00:00:28.669 --> 00:00:28.679 
whether or not they're turned the right

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:30.200 
whether or not they're turned the right
way<00:00:28.740> just<00:00:29.220> whether<00:00:29.429> or<00:00:29.669> not<00:00:29.789> they're<00:00:30.029> on<00:00:30.119> the

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:30.210 
way just whether or not they're on the

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.650 
way just whether or not they're on the
right<00:00:30.329> corner<00:00:31.610> and<00:00:32.610> notice<00:00:33.059> that<00:00:33.269> the<00:00:33.390> red<00:00:33.570> and

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
right corner and notice that the red and

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.759 
right corner and notice that the red and
the<00:00:33.720> orange<00:00:34.110> on<00:00:35.040> these<00:00:35.940> are<00:00:36.210> swapped<00:00:36.600> so<00:00:37.590> we

00:00:37.759 --> 00:00:37.769 
the orange on these are swapped so we

00:00:37.769 --> 00:00:40.700 
the orange on these are swapped so we
need<00:00:37.949> to<00:00:38.390> flip<00:00:39.390> them<00:00:39.659> from<00:00:40.050> one<00:00:40.230> place<00:00:40.440> to<00:00:40.470> the

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
need to flip them from one place to the

00:00:40.710 --> 00:01:04.439 
need to flip them from one place to the
other<00:00:43.190> this<00:00:44.190> is<00:00:44.339> our<00:00:44.489> move<00:00:44.699> for<00:00:45.000> that

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:04.449 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:06.600 

and<00:01:04.629> the<00:01:05.379> red<00:01:05.590> and<00:01:05.860> the<00:01:05.920> orange<00:01:06.310> have<00:01:06.460> been

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:06.610 
and the red and the orange have been

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:08.789 
and the red and the orange have been
flipped<00:01:06.969> position<00:01:07.840> to<00:01:08.020> another<00:01:08.320> in<00:01:08.590> the<00:01:08.680> right

00:01:08.789 --> 00:01:08.799 
flipped position to another in the right

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:12.240 
flipped position to another in the right
place<00:01:09.070> put<00:01:10.060> things<00:01:10.270> in<00:01:10.420> the<00:01:10.450> right<00:01:10.539> place<00:01:11.250> and

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:12.250 
place put things in the right place and

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:14.969 
place put things in the right place and
we<00:01:12.640> want<00:01:12.820> to<00:01:12.909> do<00:01:13.030> the<00:01:13.210> corner<00:01:13.979> orientations

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:14.979 
we want to do the corner orientations

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:17.130 
we want to do the corner orientations
now<00:01:15.159> we<00:01:15.429> can<00:01:15.610> spin<00:01:15.969> three<00:01:16.329> corners<00:01:16.750> with<00:01:16.960> this

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:17.140 
now we can spin three corners with this

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.499 
now we can spin three corners with this
one<00:01:17.649> move<00:01:18.060> it<00:01:19.060> turns<00:01:19.299> all<00:01:19.539> three<00:01:19.780> corners

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:21.509 
one move it turns all three corners

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:27.480 
one move it turns all three corners
counterclockwise<00:01:22.509> and<00:01:24.390> you've<00:01:25.390> got<00:01:26.250> you<00:01:27.250> end

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:27.490 
counterclockwise and you've got you end

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:29.520 
counterclockwise and you've got you end
up<00:01:27.640> with<00:01:27.789> either<00:01:27.969> one<00:01:28.780> corner<00:01:29.170> in<00:01:29.289> the<00:01:29.380> right

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:29.530 
up with either one corner in the right

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:31.200 
up with either one corner in the right
place<00:01:29.770> or<00:01:29.979> two<00:01:30.159> corners<00:01:30.549> in<00:01:30.670> the<00:01:30.759> right<00:01:30.909> place

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:31.210 
place or two corners in the right place

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.069 
place or two corners in the right place
if<00:01:32.110> you<00:01:32.259> have<00:01:32.380> to<00:01:33.240> you<00:01:34.240> want<00:01:34.420> to<00:01:34.509> put<00:01:34.689> them<00:01:34.780> over

00:01:35.069 --> 00:01:35.079 
if you have to you want to put them over

00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:38.039 
if you have to you want to put them over
on<00:01:36.039> the<00:01:36.159> right-hand<00:01:36.369> side<00:01:36.670> and<00:01:37.390> start<00:01:37.810> doing

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:38.049 
on the right-hand side and start doing

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:41.730 
on the right-hand side and start doing
your<00:01:38.170> move<00:01:39.750> the<00:01:40.750> one<00:01:40.959> corner<00:01:41.289> that<00:01:41.409> you're<00:01:41.560> not

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:41.740 
your move the one corner that you're not

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.919 
your move the one corner that you're not
going<00:01:41.979> to<00:01:42.039> spin<00:01:42.280> by<00:01:42.579> doing<00:01:42.970> this<00:01:43.119> is<00:01:43.390> the<00:01:43.750> one

00:01:43.919 --> 00:01:43.929 
going to spin by doing this is the one

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:47.279 
going to spin by doing this is the one
on<00:01:44.170> the<00:01:44.380> front<00:01:44.530> left<00:01:45.899> that<00:01:46.899> one's<00:01:47.079> going<00:01:47.259> to

00:01:47.279 --> 00:01:47.289 
on the front left that one's going to

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:49.800 
on the front left that one's going to
stay<00:01:47.530> the<00:01:47.649> same<00:01:47.860> so<00:01:48.610> when<00:01:48.880> you<00:01:48.970> get<00:01:49.149> one<00:01:49.360> corner

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:49.810 
stay the same so when you get one corner

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:52.080 
stay the same so when you get one corner
that's<00:01:49.959> in<00:01:50.140> the<00:01:50.229> right<00:01:50.409> position<00:01:50.979> do<00:01:51.849> you<00:01:51.880> want

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:52.090 
that's in the right position do you want

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:53.940 
that's in the right position do you want
to<00:01:52.179> put<00:01:52.299> that<00:01:52.479> on<00:01:52.630> your<00:01:52.750> front<00:01:52.959> left<00:01:53.259> and<00:01:53.590> then

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
to put that on your front left and then

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.760 
to put that on your front left and then
spend<00:01:54.280> the<00:01:54.399> other<00:01:54.520> three<00:01:54.909> and<00:01:55.659> it<00:01:56.530> will<00:01:56.590> either

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:56.770 
spend the other three and it will either

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:58.999 
spend the other three and it will either
take<00:01:57.069> one<00:01:57.340> time<00:01:57.610> or<00:01:57.849> two<00:01:58.030> time<00:01:58.270> doing<00:01:58.659> this

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
take one time or two time doing this

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:04.930 
take one time or two time doing this
until<00:02:00.009> they're<00:02:00.189> in<00:02:00.310> the<00:02:00.399> right<00:02:00.520> place

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:04.940 

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.180 

so<00:02:05.720> we've<00:02:05.870> got<00:02:06.050> the<00:02:06.200> red<00:02:06.350> green<00:02:06.650> corner<00:02:07.070> is<00:02:07.160> the

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:07.190 
so we've got the red green corner is the

00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:10.120 
so we've got the red green corner is the
one<00:02:07.520> that's<00:02:07.820> in<00:02:07.940> the<00:02:08.060> right<00:02:08.210> and<00:02:09.170> so<00:02:10.010> we're

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130 
one that's in the right and so we're

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:12.310 
one that's in the right and so we're
going<00:02:10.220> to<00:02:10.310> spin<00:02:10.550> it<00:02:10.580> once<00:02:10.880> and<00:02:11.120> it'll<00:02:11.270> put<00:02:12.170> all

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:12.320 
going to spin it once and it'll put all

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:13.630 
going to spin it once and it'll put all
three<00:02:12.500> of<00:02:12.620> those<00:02:12.770> corners<00:02:13.190> in<00:02:13.340> the<00:02:13.460> right

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 
three of those corners in the right

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:31.440 
three of those corners in the right
place<00:02:15.070> and<00:02:16.070> the<00:02:16.160> right<00:02:16.310> orientation<00:02:16.610> that<00:02:17.390> is

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:31.450 

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:34.020 

now<00:02:32.020> our<00:02:32.200> corners<00:02:32.620> are<00:02:32.800> done<00:02:32.980> we<00:02:33.550> just<00:02:33.580> got<00:02:33.910> to

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:34.030 
now our corners are done we just got to

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.130 
now our corners are done we just got to
do<00:02:34.120> those<00:02:34.330> edges

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:38.140 

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:41.340 

and<00:02:38.260> there's<00:02:38.860> two<00:02:39.040> different<00:02:39.250> moves<00:02:39.640> and<00:02:40.350> one

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:41.350 
and there's two different moves and one

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:47.710 
and there's two different moves and one
of<00:02:41.500> them<00:02:41.650> turns<00:02:42.010> three<00:02:42.850> pieces

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:47.720 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.440 

it<00:02:48.260> swaps<00:02:48.770> three<00:02:49.100> pieces<00:02:49.340> flicks<00:02:49.910> one<00:02:50.120> of<00:02:50.240> them

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:50.450 
it swaps three pieces flicks one of them

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:55.890 
it swaps three pieces flicks one of them
are<00:02:50.660> flips<00:02:51.020> two<00:02:51.260> of<00:02:51.410> them

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:55.900 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.720 

this<00:02:56.530> one<00:02:56.709> will<00:02:56.769> take<00:02:56.950> some<00:02:57.189> practice<00:02:57.340> to

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
this one will take some practice to

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:05.730 
this one will take some practice to
learn

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:05.740 

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:08.100 

so<00:03:06.370> we<00:03:06.520> moved<00:03:06.730> three<00:03:07.000> pieces<00:03:07.210> and<00:03:07.570> this<00:03:07.930> is<00:03:08.080> a

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:08.110 
so we moved three pieces and this is a

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:10.980 
so we moved three pieces and this is a
configuration<00:03:08.950> I<00:03:09.070> find<00:03:09.310> a<00:03:09.430> lot<00:03:09.600> and<00:03:10.600> you<00:03:10.780> put

00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:10.990 
configuration I find a lot and you put

00:03:10.990 --> 00:03:15.570 
configuration I find a lot and you put
those<00:03:11.170> on<00:03:11.440> the<00:03:11.560> bottom<00:03:11.950> that<00:03:12.910> way<00:03:14.430> and<00:03:15.430> we'll

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:15.580 
those on the bottom that way and we'll

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:17.340 
those on the bottom that way and we'll
do<00:03:15.700> our<00:03:15.730> little<00:03:16.060> move<00:03:16.330> again<00:03:16.630> where<00:03:16.810> we<00:03:16.960> rotate

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:17.350 
do our little move again where we rotate

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:28.500 
do our little move again where we rotate
everything<00:03:17.770> left

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:28.510 

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.479 

and<00:03:28.720> then<00:03:29.230> we're<00:03:29.379> gonna<00:03:29.439> do<00:03:29.860> our<00:03:29.890> move<00:03:30.280> where

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:30.489 
and then we're gonna do our move where

00:03:30.489 --> 00:03:32.759 
and then we're gonna do our move where
we<00:03:30.610> turn<00:03:30.790> everything<00:03:31.150> the<00:03:31.450> other<00:03:31.599> way<00:03:31.870> and<00:03:32.140> you

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:32.769 
we turn everything the other way and you

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:34.050 
we turn everything the other way and you
want<00:03:32.950> to<00:03:33.040> put<00:03:33.189> your<00:03:33.280> side<00:03:33.549> that<00:03:33.760> you<00:03:33.849> don't

00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:34.060 
want to put your side that you don't

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:38.910 
want to put your side that you don't
want<00:03:34.269> to<00:03:34.360> move<00:03:34.540> on<00:03:34.810> your<00:03:35.140> right<00:03:35.319> hand<00:03:37.739> which<00:03:38.739> in

00:03:38.910 --> 00:03:38.920 
want to move on your right hand which in

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:45.470 
want to move on your right hand which in
this<00:03:39.069> case<00:03:39.129> is<00:03:39.310> the<00:03:39.519> orange<00:03:39.939> side

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:45.480 

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.630 

this<00:03:46.019> move<00:03:46.260> is<00:03:46.379> a<00:03:46.409> little<00:03:46.680> tricky<00:03:46.920> it<00:03:47.099> looks<00:03:47.280> it

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:47.640 
this move is a little tricky it looks it

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.220 
this move is a little tricky it looks it
looks<00:03:47.790> harder<00:03:48.150> than<00:03:48.330> it<00:03:48.360> is<00:03:48.599> though<00:03:48.840> once<00:03:49.140> you

00:03:49.220 --> 00:03:49.230 
looks harder than it is though once you

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:53.390 
looks harder than it is though once you
learn<00:03:49.440> it<00:03:49.620> its<00:03:49.739> it's<00:03:50.280> pretty<00:03:50.580> easy<00:03:52.400> and

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:53.400 
learn it its it's pretty easy and

00:03:53.400 --> 00:04:03.890 
learn it its it's pretty easy and
there's<00:03:54.120> the<00:03:54.330> solution

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.959
