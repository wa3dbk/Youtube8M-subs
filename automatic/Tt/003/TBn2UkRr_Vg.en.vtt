00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:19.860 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:22.890 

this<00:00:20.860> is<00:00:21.130> the<00:00:21.640> starting<00:00:22.000> point<00:00:22.060> for<00:00:22.540> the<00:00:22.630> next

book of mine that will be published and

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:27.150 
book of mine that will be published and
it<00:00:25.510> started<00:00:25.930> making<00:00:26.230> me<00:00:26.350> think<00:00:26.590> about<00:00:26.830> what

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:27.160 
it started making me think about what

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.580 
it started making me think about what
happens<00:00:27.490> when<00:00:27.580> a<00:00:27.700> gun<00:00:27.910> is<00:00:27.939> fired<00:00:28.240> and<00:00:28.630> the<00:00:29.410> way

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:29.590 
happens when a gun is fired and the way

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:33.290 
happens when a gun is fired and the way
a<00:00:29.890> gun<00:00:30.160> is<00:00:30.480> its<00:00:31.480> machine<00:00:31.840> if<00:00:32.050> you<00:00:32.200> like<00:00:32.380> it's<00:00:32.710> a

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
a gun is its machine if you like it's a

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.760 
a gun is its machine if you like it's a
very<00:00:34.300> perfect<00:00:34.720> machine<00:00:34.809> it<00:00:35.080> does<00:00:35.200> one<00:00:35.380> job<00:00:35.590> and

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:35.770 
very perfect machine it does one job and

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:37.229 
very perfect machine it does one job and
it<00:00:35.860> does<00:00:35.980> it<00:00:36.100> very<00:00:36.129> very<00:00:36.460> well<00:00:36.730> but<00:00:37.059> then<00:00:37.150> if

00:00:37.229 --> 00:00:37.239 
it does it very very well but then if

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:38.640 
it does it very very well but then if
you<00:00:37.300> think<00:00:37.480> about<00:00:37.660> what<00:00:37.809> a<00:00:37.840> bullet<00:00:38.199> does<00:00:38.470> at

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:38.650 
you think about what a bullet does at

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:41.070 
you think about what a bullet does at
the<00:00:38.739> other<00:00:38.890> end<00:00:39.129> of<00:00:39.400> its<00:00:39.550> life<00:00:39.640> it's<00:00:40.480> horrible

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:41.080 
the other end of its life it's horrible

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:42.780 
the other end of its life it's horrible
is<00:00:41.230> that<00:00:41.260> appalling<00:00:41.680> thing<00:00:42.160> and<00:00:42.400> I<00:00:42.460> want<00:00:42.580> to<00:00:42.640> do

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:42.790 
is that appalling thing and I want to do

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:44.970 
is that appalling thing and I want to do
write<00:00:42.970> a<00:00:43.000> book<00:00:43.239> that<00:00:43.420> sort<00:00:43.600> of<00:00:43.629> captured<00:00:44.110> those

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:44.980 
write a book that sort of captured those

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.280 
write a book that sort of captured those
two<00:00:45.309> sides<00:00:45.670> of<00:00:45.879> that<00:00:45.910> and<00:00:46.300> all<00:00:46.660> of<00:00:46.809> that<00:00:46.840> came

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:47.290 
two sides of that and all of that came

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:49.950 
two sides of that and all of that came
from<00:00:48.120> thinking<00:00:49.120> about<00:00:49.210> this<00:00:49.540> little<00:00:49.660> shell

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:49.960 
from thinking about this little shell

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:51.479 
from thinking about this little shell
case<00:00:50.170> so<00:00:50.410> it's<00:00:50.530> an<00:00:50.590> example<00:00:50.949> of<00:00:51.010> how<00:00:51.160> a<00:00:51.190> whole

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:51.489 
case so it's an example of how a whole

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:55.490 
case so it's an example of how a whole
book<00:00:51.699> can<00:00:51.880> grow<00:00:52.059> out<00:00:52.270> of<00:00:52.420> the<00:00:52.630> smallest<00:00:52.870> thing

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
book can grow out of the smallest thing

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.460 
book can grow out of the smallest thing
I<00:00:55.590> didn't<00:00:56.490> really<00:00:56.580> have<00:00:56.670> a<00:00:56.850> sense<00:00:57.360> of<00:00:57.630> being<00:00:58.380> a

00:00:58.460 --> 00:00:58.470 
I didn't really have a sense of being a

00:00:58.470 --> 00:00:59.780 
I didn't really have a sense of being a
writer<00:00:58.680> when<00:00:58.950> I<00:00:59.010> was<00:00:59.160> a<00:00:59.220> child<00:00:59.250> in<00:00:59.520> fact<00:00:59.730> I

00:00:59.780 --> 00:00:59.790 
writer when I was a child in fact I

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:00.740 
writer when I was a child in fact I
think<00:00:59.850> it<00:01:00.030> was<00:01:00.120> probably<00:01:00.210> the<00:01:00.450> complete

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
think it was probably the complete

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.750 
think it was probably the complete
opposite<00:01:01.170> in<00:01:01.440> that<00:01:01.739> I<00:01:01.920> think<00:01:02.160> I<00:01:02.250> got<00:01:02.430> put<00:01:02.640> off

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
opposite in that I think I got put off

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.670 
opposite in that I think I got put off
by<00:01:03.060> it<00:01:03.090> because<00:01:03.330> the<00:01:04.229> only<00:01:04.379> thing<00:01:04.470> I<00:01:04.620> can

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
by it because the only thing I can

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.050 
by it because the only thing I can
remember<00:01:04.860> about<00:01:05.129> being<00:01:05.580> a<00:01:05.640> writer<00:01:05.850> with

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:06.060 
remember about being a writer with

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:07.670 
remember about being a writer with
someone<00:01:06.390> saying<00:01:06.750> to<00:01:06.930> me<00:01:07.050> you<00:01:07.260> can't<00:01:07.500> be<00:01:07.590> a

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
someone saying to me you can't be a

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.580 
someone saying to me you can't be a
right<00:01:07.890> and<00:01:08.100> no<00:01:08.160> one<00:01:08.280> makes<00:01:08.460> money<00:01:08.670> doing<00:01:09.270> that

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:09.590 
right and no one makes money doing that

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.410 
right and no one makes money doing that
and<00:01:10.590> I<00:01:10.650> think<00:01:10.680> that<00:01:10.979> actually<00:01:11.310> stopped<00:01:12.270> me

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:12.420 
and I think that actually stopped me

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.700 
and I think that actually stopped me
doing<00:01:12.690> it<00:01:12.840> probably<00:01:13.140> well<00:01:13.320> into<00:01:13.440> my<00:01:13.680> adult

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
doing it probably well into my adult

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.290 
doing it probably well into my adult
life<00:01:14.130> I<00:01:14.280> think<00:01:14.460> I<00:01:14.550> might<00:01:14.700> got<00:01:14.910> around<00:01:15.060> to<00:01:15.210> it

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:15.300 
life I think I might got around to it

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.630 
life I think I might got around to it
quite<00:01:15.479> a<00:01:15.510> bit<00:01:15.630> sooner<00:01:16.200> were<00:01:17.130> it<00:01:17.250> not<00:01:17.280> for<00:01:17.430> that

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:17.640 
quite a bit sooner were it not for that

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.070 
quite a bit sooner were it not for that
sometimes<00:01:18.210> those<00:01:18.420> little<00:01:18.720> things<00:01:18.750> that

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
sometimes those little things that

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.050 
sometimes those little things that
people<00:01:19.320> say<00:01:19.500> to<00:01:20.190> you<00:01:20.280> at<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:20.490> right<00:01:20.640> moment

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.060 
people say to you at the right moment

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.240 
people say to you at the right moment
can<00:01:21.210> stick<00:01:21.450> with<00:01:21.660> you<00:01:21.840> for<00:01:22.650> a<00:01:22.680> long<00:01:22.800> time

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:25.250 

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.600 

so<00:01:26.250> after<00:01:26.490> a<00:01:27.150> levels<00:01:27.869> i<00:01:28.140> went<00:01:28.830> to<00:01:28.950> university

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
so after a levels i went to university

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.690 
so after a levels i went to university
and<00:01:29.880> university<00:01:30.420> I<00:01:30.900> did<00:01:31.290> mathematics<00:01:32.159> and<00:01:32.460> I'm

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:32.700 
and university I did mathematics and I'm

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:35.359 
and university I did mathematics and I'm
laughing<00:01:33.330> because<00:01:33.780> I<00:01:34.229> lasted<00:01:34.649> precisely<00:01:34.979> one

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:35.369 
laughing because I lasted precisely one

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:38.749 
laughing because I lasted precisely one
year<00:01:35.640> doing<00:01:36.320> maths<00:01:37.320> at<00:01:37.590> university<00:01:38.189> when

00:01:38.749 --> 00:01:38.759 
year doing maths at university when

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:40.219 
year doing maths at university when
Howie<00:01:39.000> had<00:01:39.270> gone<00:01:39.420> by<00:01:39.570> and<00:01:39.600> I<00:01:39.840> hadn't<00:01:40.110> seen<00:01:40.170> a

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229 
Howie had gone by and I hadn't seen a

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.859 
Howie had gone by and I hadn't seen a
single<00:01:40.470> number<00:01:41.180> anywhere<00:01:42.180> all<00:01:42.360> I<00:01:42.390> team<00:01:42.690> was

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
single number anywhere all I team was

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.320 
single number anywhere all I team was
Egyptian<00:01:43.110> hieroglyphics<00:01:43.920> I<00:01:44.130> decided<00:01:45.119> it

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:45.330 
Egyptian hieroglyphics I decided it

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:46.580 
Egyptian hieroglyphics I decided it
wasn't<00:01:45.450> for<00:01:45.570> me<00:01:45.690> on<00:01:45.810> a<00:01:45.840> change<00:01:46.080> course<00:01:46.350> at<00:01:46.560> that

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
wasn't for me on a change course at that

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.490 
wasn't for me on a change course at that
point<00:01:46.680> to<00:01:47.460> politics<00:01:47.909> and<00:01:48.240> actually<00:01:48.930> graduated

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
point to politics and actually graduated

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.460 
point to politics and actually graduated
with<00:01:49.619> the<00:01:49.680> politics<00:01:50.009> degree<00:01:50.810> and<00:01:51.810> other

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.470 
with the politics degree and other

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:53.899 
with the politics degree and other
reason<00:01:52.799> I<00:01:52.830> chose<00:01:52.979> politics<00:01:53.490> was<00:01:53.670> simply

00:01:53.899 --> 00:01:53.909 
reason I chose politics was simply

00:01:53.909 --> 00:01:55.940 
reason I chose politics was simply
because<00:01:54.149> having<00:01:54.450> got<00:01:54.619> University<00:01:55.619> and<00:01:55.740> spent

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
because having got University and spent

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.469 
because having got University and spent
a<00:01:56.070> year<00:01:56.250> getting<00:01:56.280> established<00:01:56.729> there<00:01:57.300> that

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
a year getting established there that

00:01:57.479 --> 00:01:59.090 
a year getting established there that
was<00:01:57.659> the<00:01:57.840> most<00:01:58.020> interesting<00:01:58.350> course<00:01:58.770> I<00:01:58.920> could

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
was the most interesting course I could

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.919 
was the most interesting course I could
change<00:01:59.310> to<00:01:59.550> at<00:01:59.759> the<00:01:59.880> University<00:02:00.479> that<00:02:00.690> I<00:02:00.720> was

00:02:00.919 --> 00:02:00.929 
change to at the University that I was

00:02:00.929 --> 00:02:02.840 
change to at the University that I was
at<00:02:01.110> because<00:02:01.950> they<00:02:02.190> didn't<00:02:02.399> have<00:02:02.429> an<00:02:02.610> arts

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
at because they didn't have an arts

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.840 
at because they didn't have an arts
faculty<00:02:03.060> and<00:02:03.679> but<00:02:04.679> when<00:02:04.799> I<00:02:04.830> left<00:02:05.009> University<00:02:05.159> I

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
faculty and but when I left University I

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.969 
faculty and but when I left University I
started<00:02:06.390> to<00:02:06.450> really<00:02:07.140> begin<00:02:07.380> to<00:02:07.470> think<00:02:07.740> about

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
started to really begin to think about

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:12.289 
started to really begin to think about
what<00:02:08.100> I<00:02:08.130> wanted<00:02:08.489> to<00:02:08.549> do<00:02:08.780> and<00:02:10.819> to<00:02:11.819> my<00:02:11.940> horror<00:02:11.970> I

00:02:12.289 --> 00:02:12.299 
what I wanted to do and to my horror I

00:02:12.299 --> 00:02:13.820 
what I wanted to do and to my horror I

but I couldn't get a job doing anything
at<00:02:15.630> all

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:17.270 
at all

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.630 
at all
I<00:02:17.330> I<00:02:18.020> don't<00:02:18.770> know<00:02:18.890> what<00:02:19.040> I<00:02:19.070> would<00:02:19.280> have<00:02:19.310> done<00:02:19.400> if

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:19.640 
I I don't know what I would have done if

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:20.920 
I I don't know what I would have done if
I'd<00:02:19.760> have<00:02:19.910> thought<00:02:20.210> more<00:02:20.450> carefully<00:02:20.900> about

I'd have thought more carefully about

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.040 
I'd have thought more carefully about
University<00:02:21.680> and<00:02:21.950> I<00:02:22.310> think<00:02:23.120> in<00:02:23.240> retrospect<00:02:23.540> you

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
University and I think in retrospect you

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:25.780 
University and I think in retrospect you
know<00:02:24.170> if<00:02:24.680> I've<00:02:24.830> had<00:02:25.010> more<00:02:25.160> guidance<00:02:25.490> when<00:02:25.700> I

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:25.790 
know if I've had more guidance when I

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.550 
know if I've had more guidance when I
was<00:02:25.880> younger<00:02:26.060> there<00:02:26.660> were<00:02:26.750> courses<00:02:27.170> that<00:02:27.380> went

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:27.560 
was younger there were courses that went

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.170 
was younger there were courses that went
by<00:02:27.860> the<00:02:27.920> time<00:02:28.100> I<00:02:28.130> graduated<00:02:28.310> three<00:02:28.820> courses

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
by the time I graduated three courses

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.410 
by the time I graduated three courses
like<00:02:29.360> archaeology<00:02:30.160> our<00:02:31.160> history<00:02:31.790> other

like archaeology our history other

like archaeology our history other
things<00:02:32.750> that<00:02:32.870> I<00:02:32.990> think<00:02:33.200> I<00:02:33.320> might<00:02:33.470> have<00:02:33.500> wanted

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:33.860 
things that I think I might have wanted

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:36.880 
things that I think I might have wanted
to<00:02:34.130> have<00:02:34.250> done<00:02:34.460> and<00:02:35.020> but<00:02:36.020> you<00:02:36.290> know<00:02:36.380> my<00:02:36.680> time

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:36.890 
to have done and but you know my time

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:38.710 
to have done and but you know my time
had<00:02:37.040> gone<00:02:37.160> by<00:02:37.220> then<00:02:37.580> so<00:02:37.790> by<00:02:38.060> that<00:02:38.090> point<00:02:38.450> I<00:02:38.630> was

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:38.720 
had gone by then so by that point I was

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:40.120 
had gone by then so by that point I was
just<00:02:38.840> thinking<00:02:39.140> we'll<00:02:39.290> walk<00:02:39.440> what<00:02:39.740> can<00:02:39.920> I<00:02:39.980> get

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:40.130 
just thinking we'll walk what can I get

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:42.190 
just thinking we'll walk what can I get
into<00:02:40.280> now<00:02:40.640> and<00:02:40.850> still<00:02:41.330> without<00:02:41.570> a<00:02:41.630> very<00:02:41.870> strong

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:42.200 
into now and still without a very strong

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.020 
into now and still without a very strong
sense<00:02:42.440> of<00:02:42.710> what<00:02:43.340> I<00:02:43.370> was<00:02:43.550> going<00:02:43.700> to<00:02:43.850> do<00:02:44.000> but

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.030 
sense of what I was going to do but

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.630 
sense of what I was going to do but
really<00:02:44.420> the<00:02:44.600> the<00:02:44.630> final<00:02:44.990> catalyst<00:02:45.620> in<00:02:46.490> my

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:46.640 
really the the final catalyst in my

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.160 
really the the final catalyst in my
career<00:02:46.850> was<00:02:47.000> accidentally<00:02:47.810> and<00:02:47.990> I<00:02:48.050> say

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170 
career was accidentally and I say

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:49.780 
career was accidentally and I say
accidentally<00:02:48.860> getting<00:02:49.010> a<00:02:49.190> job<00:02:49.370> in<00:02:49.550> a<00:02:49.610> bookshop

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:49.790 
accidentally getting a job in a bookshop

00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:51.940 
accidentally getting a job in a bookshop
and<00:02:50.300> it<00:02:50.900> wasn't<00:02:51.140> just<00:02:51.230> any<00:02:51.410> book<00:02:51.530> shop<00:02:51.740> it<00:02:51.890> was

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
and it wasn't just any book shop it was

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:53.530 
and it wasn't just any book shop it was
specifically<00:02:52.370> a<00:02:52.460> children's<00:02:52.880> book<00:02:53.060> shop<00:02:53.360> and

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:53.540 
specifically a children's book shop and

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.030 
specifically a children's book shop and
it<00:02:53.990> was<00:02:54.080> there<00:02:54.230> that<00:02:54.260> I<00:02:54.410> saw<00:02:54.560> fell<00:02:54.770> in<00:02:54.890> love

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:55.040 
it was there that I saw fell in love

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:56.860 
it was there that I saw fell in love
with<00:02:55.250> contemporary<00:02:55.730> children's<00:02:56.180> writing<00:02:56.630> and

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
with contemporary children's writing and

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.320 
with contemporary children's writing and
started<00:02:57.530> to<00:02:57.620> think<00:02:57.770> actually<00:02:57.980> i<00:02:58.460> remember<00:02:59.120> i

00:02:59.320 --> 00:02:59.330 
started to think actually i remember i

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:01.150 
started to think actually i remember i
did<00:02:59.600> want<00:02:59.810> to<00:02:59.930> try<00:03:00.110> and<00:03:00.230> write<00:03:00.380> once<00:03:00.890> upon<00:03:01.130> a

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.160 
did want to try and write once upon a

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:02.770 
did want to try and write once upon a
time<00:03:01.400> and<00:03:01.700> this<00:03:02.000> made<00:03:02.210> me<00:03:02.330> think<00:03:02.360> that<00:03:02.600> I<00:03:02.660> could

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:02.780 
time and this made me think that I could

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.720 
time and this made me think that I could
actually<00:03:03.050> have<00:03:03.350> the<00:03:03.440> right<00:03:03.620> to<00:03:03.770> go<00:03:03.920> and<00:03:04.040> do<00:03:04.130> it

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:06.730 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:08.309 

it's<00:03:06.970> a<00:03:07.150> very<00:03:07.390> strange<00:03:07.750> thing<00:03:07.870> when<00:03:08.200> your

00:03:08.309 --> 00:03:08.319 
it's a very strange thing when your

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:10.649 
it's a very strange thing when your
first<00:03:08.560> book<00:03:08.860> comes<00:03:09.250> out<00:03:09.550> and<00:03:09.849> don't<00:03:10.360> get<00:03:10.510> me

00:03:10.649 --> 00:03:10.659 
first book comes out and don't get me

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:13.110 
first book comes out and don't get me
wrong<00:03:10.840> is<00:03:11.110> a<00:03:11.379> wonderful<00:03:12.129> and<00:03:12.340> amazing<00:03:12.519> feeling

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
wrong is a wonderful and amazing feeling

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.820 
wrong is a wonderful and amazing feeling
but<00:03:13.360> the<00:03:13.810> whole<00:03:14.049> publishing<00:03:14.349> process<00:03:14.650> is<00:03:14.799> a

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:14.830 
but the whole publishing process is a

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:17.580 
but the whole publishing process is a
very<00:03:15.129> slow<00:03:15.879> beast<00:03:16.510> and<00:03:16.900> so<00:03:17.230> from<00:03:17.470> the<00:03:17.560> moment

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:17.590 
very slow beast and so from the moment

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:20.220 
very slow beast and so from the moment
of<00:03:17.920> which<00:03:18.099> you<00:03:18.310> write<00:03:19.000> your<00:03:19.150> story<00:03:19.480> and<00:03:19.780> then

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:20.230 
of which you write your story and then

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:22.050 
of which you write your story and then
someone<00:03:20.560> says<00:03:20.680> yes<00:03:20.860> to<00:03:20.980> publish<00:03:21.310> it<00:03:21.489> and<00:03:21.610> then

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:22.060 
someone says yes to publish it and then
