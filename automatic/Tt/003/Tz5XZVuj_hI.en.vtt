the<00:00:58.160> reason<00:00:58.489> I<00:00:58.579> do<00:00:58.640> it<00:00:58.730> this<00:00:58.940> way<00:00:59.150> is<00:00:59.420> because

00:00:59.639 --> 00:00:59.649 
the reason I do it this way is because

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:03.160 
the reason I do it this way is because
when<00:01:00.649> i<00:01:00.680> made<00:01:00.950> this<00:01:01.190> cover<00:01:01.730> gel<00:01:02.030> i<00:01:02.270> used<00:01:02.899> a

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:03.170 
when i made this cover gel i used a

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.930 
when i made this cover gel i used a
powdered<00:01:03.710> makeup<00:01:04.670> and<00:01:06.159> it's<00:01:07.159> like<00:01:07.400> a<00:01:07.430> powdered

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:07.940 
powdered makeup and it's like a powdered

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.600 
powdered makeup and it's like a powdered
foundation<00:01:08.630> and<00:01:09.050> I'm<00:01:09.620> I<00:01:10.010> wasn't<00:01:10.460> too<00:01:10.580> sure

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:10.610 
foundation and I'm I wasn't too sure

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.450 
foundation and I'm I wasn't too sure
about<00:01:11.090> you<00:01:11.630> know<00:01:11.750> it<00:01:12.290> having<00:01:12.770> trace<00:01:13.010> amounts

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:13.460 
about you know it having trace amounts

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.180 
about you know it having trace amounts
of oils<00:01:14.360> in<00:01:14.540> it<00:01:14.690> which<00:01:15.260> could<00:01:15.470> cause<00:01:15.650> lifting

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:16.190 
of oils in it which could cause lifting

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:18.520 
of oils in it which could cause lifting
and<00:01:16.400> I<00:01:17.360> didn't<00:01:17.930> really<00:01:18.049> want<00:01:18.290> to<00:01:18.320> take<00:01:18.470> a

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530 
and I didn't really want to take a

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.690 
and I didn't really want to take a
chance<00:01:18.620> with<00:01:19.190> that<00:01:19.880> on<00:01:20.210> this<00:01:20.570> set<00:01:20.930> so<00:01:21.670> this<00:01:22.670> is

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:22.700 
chance with that on this set so this is

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:24.820 
chance with that on this set so this is
the<00:01:22.970> reason<00:01:23.120> I<00:01:23.299> did<00:01:23.479> it<00:01:23.600> this<00:01:23.690> way<00:01:23.900> now<00:01:24.799> i

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:24.830 
the reason I did it this way now i

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:27.399 
the reason I did it this way now i
really<00:01:25.370> wish<00:01:25.729> i<00:01:25.760> would<00:01:26.270> have<00:01:26.299> taken<00:01:26.659> one<00:01:27.110> nail
