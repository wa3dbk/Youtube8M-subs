00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:06.289 
today I'm going to show you how to make
a<00:00:03.389> time-lapse<00:00:03.840> in<00:00:04.380> Photoshop<00:00:05.069> now<00:00:06.060> if<00:00:06.180> you

00:00:06.289 --> 00:00:06.299 
a time-lapse in Photoshop now if you

00:00:06.299 --> 00:00:08.540 
a time-lapse in Photoshop now if you
have<00:00:06.450> a<00:00:06.480> slower<00:00:06.899> computer<00:00:07.140> with<00:00:07.649> not<00:00:08.010> as<00:00:08.280> much

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:08.550 
have a slower computer with not as much

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.419 
have a slower computer with not as much
physical<00:00:08.820> memory<00:00:09.860> especially<00:00:10.860> a<00:00:10.889> laptop<00:00:11.400> you

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:11.429 
physical memory especially a laptop you

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:13.520 
physical memory especially a laptop you
may<00:00:11.730> want<00:00:11.969> to<00:00:12.090> resize<00:00:12.509> your<00:00:12.540> images<00:00:13.170> first

00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:13.530 
may want to resize your images first

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.560 
may want to resize your images first
before<00:00:13.830> you<00:00:14.160> start<00:00:14.400> doing<00:00:14.549> the<00:00:14.700> video<00:00:14.940> so<00:00:15.480> I'm

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:15.570 
before you start doing the video so I'm

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:17.570 
before you start doing the video so I'm
going<00:00:15.750> to<00:00:15.780> show<00:00:15.960> you<00:00:16.020> a<00:00:16.139> quick<00:00:16.379> way<00:00:16.680> you<00:00:17.279> can

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
going to show you a quick way you can

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.730 
going to show you a quick way you can
resize<00:00:18.180> multiple<00:00:18.869> images<00:00:19.320> at<00:00:19.560> once

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:21.740 
resize multiple images at once

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:24.800 
resize multiple images at once
eventually<00:00:22.740> we're<00:00:22.949> going<00:00:23.130> to<00:00:23.250> go<00:00:23.640> to<00:00:23.810> automate

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:24.810 
eventually we're going to go to automate

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.439 
eventually we're going to go to automate
and<00:00:24.990> batch<00:00:25.320> but<00:00:26.220> first<00:00:26.460> we<00:00:26.640> need<00:00:26.820> to<00:00:26.910> create<00:00:27.180> an

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
and batch but first we need to create an

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.259 
and batch but first we need to create an
action<00:00:27.960> because<00:00:28.080> batch<00:00:28.949> is<00:00:29.250> going<00:00:29.490> to<00:00:29.670> use<00:00:29.970> our

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:30.269 
action because batch is going to use our

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:33.380 
action because batch is going to use our
action<00:00:31.430> so<00:00:32.430> I'll<00:00:32.550> go<00:00:32.700> ahead<00:00:32.759> and<00:00:32.969> open<00:00:33.090> an

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:33.390 
action so I'll go ahead and open an

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:39.950 
action so I'll go ahead and open an
image<00:00:33.600> real<00:00:33.960> quick<00:00:35.120> and<00:00:37.820> create<00:00:38.820> a<00:00:39.059> new<00:00:39.360> set<00:00:39.750> in

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
image real quick and create a new set in

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.220 
image real quick and create a new set in
the<00:00:40.290> actions<00:00:40.829> and<00:00:41.660> now<00:00:42.660> I'm<00:00:42.840> just<00:00:43.050> going<00:00:43.200> to

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
the actions and now I'm just going to

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.740 
the actions and now I'm just going to
create<00:00:43.500> a<00:00:43.770> new<00:00:44.100> action<00:00:44.370> basically<00:00:45.149> this<00:00:45.570> will

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750 
create a new action basically this will

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:48.470 
create a new action basically this will
record<00:00:46.079> each<00:00:46.350> step<00:00:46.800> you<00:00:47.010> do<00:00:47.250> to<00:00:47.460> an<00:00:47.610> image<00:00:47.969> and

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480 
record each step you do to an image and

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:50.270 
record each step you do to an image and
I'll<00:00:48.570> save<00:00:48.809> it<00:00:48.840> and<00:00:49.140> it<00:00:49.350> can<00:00:49.500> do<00:00:49.649> it<00:00:49.680> again<00:00:50.010> for

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:50.280 
I'll save it and it can do it again for

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:52.990 
I'll save it and it can do it again for
you<00:00:50.660> so<00:00:51.660> I'm<00:00:51.899> going<00:00:52.079> to<00:00:52.110> start<00:00:52.440> out<00:00:52.620> by<00:00:52.920> doing

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:53.000 
you so I'm going to start out by doing

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.200 
you so I'm going to start out by doing
image<00:00:54.000> size<00:00:54.289> ctrl<00:00:55.289> alt<00:00:55.559> I<00:00:55.800> or<00:00:56.219> command<00:00:56.640> option

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
image size ctrl alt I or command option

00:00:57.210 --> 00:01:02.090

I<00:00:57.859> on<00:00:58.859> a<00:00:58.920> Mac<00:00:59.309> and<00:00:59.960> in<00:01:00.960> this<00:01:01.140> case<00:01:01.379> I'm<00:01:01.680> going<00:01:01.949> to

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100 
I on a Mac and in this case I'm going to

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:07.039 
I on a Mac and in this case I'm going to
do<00:01:02.390> 4k<00:01:03.390> video<00:01:04.159> if<00:01:05.159> you're<00:01:05.820> doing<00:01:06.030> if<00:01:06.540> if<00:01:06.780> your

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:07.049 
do 4k video if you're doing if if your

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:14.600 
do 4k video if you're doing if if your
computer<00:01:07.590> has<00:01:09.650> less<00:01:10.650> than<00:01:12.350> probably<00:01:13.350> 6<00:01:14.070> to<00:01:14.400> 8

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
computer has less than probably 6 to 8

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.719 
computer has less than probably 6 to 8
gigabytes<00:01:15.210> of<00:01:15.360> RAM<00:01:15.630> you<00:01:16.229> probably<00:01:16.920> want<00:01:17.280> to<00:01:17.400> do

00:01:17.719 --> 00:01:17.729 
gigabytes of RAM you probably want to do

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:22.840 
gigabytes of RAM you probably want to do
1080<00:01:18.390> but<00:01:19.229> I'm<00:01:19.530> going<00:01:19.799> to<00:01:19.860> do<00:01:20.009> 4<00:01:20.250> K<00:01:20.460> which<00:01:20.850> is

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
1080 but I'm going to do 4 K which is

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.469 
1080 but I'm going to do 4 K which is
2160<00:01:23.850> pixels<00:01:23.880> high<00:01:25.369> so<00:01:26.369> I'll<00:01:26.430> do<00:01:26.580> that<00:01:26.759> and<00:01:27.000> if

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
2160 pixels high so I'll do that and if

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.539 
2160 pixels high so I'll do that and if
you<00:01:27.600> notice<00:01:27.960> the<00:01:28.140> action<00:01:28.500> recorded<00:01:29.040> image

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549 
you notice the action recorded image

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.539 
you notice the action recorded image
size<00:01:29.820> within<00:01:30.810> the<00:01:31.110> image<00:01:31.380> size<00:01:31.590> it's<00:01:31.950> recorded

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
size within the image size it's recorded

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:37.010 
size within the image size it's recorded
all<00:01:32.700> of<00:01:32.759> the<00:01:33.600> input<00:01:33.960> I<00:01:34.140> put<00:01:34.380> in<00:01:35.450> the<00:01:36.450> next<00:01:36.630> thing

crop<00:01:47.790> it<00:01:47.850> to<00:01:48.119> a<00:01:48.149> 16<00:01:48.630> by<00:01:48.810> 9<00:01:48.840> aspect<00:01:49.049> ratio<00:01:49.560> that's

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
crop it to a 16 by 9 aspect ratio that's

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.370 
crop it to a 16 by 9 aspect ratio that's
fine<00:01:50.520> too<00:01:50.729> the<00:01:50.939> action<00:01:51.210> will<00:01:51.299> record<00:01:51.659> it<00:01:51.780> it'll

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:52.380 
fine too the action will record it it'll

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.069 
fine too the action will record it it'll
do<00:01:52.470> it<00:01:52.619> on<00:01:52.770> each<00:01:52.979> picture<00:01:53.549> in<00:01:53.790> the<00:01:53.880> batch<00:01:54.079> but

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
do it on each picture in the batch but

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:59.600 
do it on each picture in the batch but
I'm<00:01:55.290> just<00:01:55.500> going<00:01:55.799> to<00:01:55.829> save<00:01:56.340> it<00:01:56.520> and<00:01:57.680> push<00:01:58.680> ctrl

I'm just going to save it and push ctrl

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.950 
I'm just going to save it and push ctrl
+<00:01:59.969> W<00:02:00.659> to<00:02:01.049> close<00:02:01.290> the<00:02:01.500> document<00:02:02.540> and<00:02:03.540> you<00:02:03.659> notice

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
+ W to close the document and you notice

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:06.499 
+ W to close the document and you notice
it<00:02:04.079> recorded<00:02:04.619> each<00:02:04.920> of<00:02:05.219> those<00:02:05.340> steps<00:02:05.610> so<00:02:06.420> I'll

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
it recorded each of those steps so I'll

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.350 
it recorded each of those steps so I'll
collapse<00:02:06.840> the<00:02:07.049> action<00:02:07.380> and<00:02:07.560> select<00:02:08.429> it

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
collapse the action and select it

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.020 
collapse the action and select it
and<00:02:09.990> now<00:02:10.410> I'm<00:02:10.680> going<00:02:10.860> to<00:02:10.950> go<00:02:11.100> to<00:02:11.160> automate<00:02:11.820> and

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:12.030 
and now I'm going to go to automate and

to<00:04:15.430> go<00:04:15.549> by<00:04:16.090> pretty<00:04:16.269> fast<00:04:16.600> so<00:04:16.750> I<00:04:16.810> don't<00:04:17.139> need<00:04:17.320> to

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:17.500 
to go by pretty fast so I don't need to

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.039 
to go by pretty fast so I don't need to
do<00:04:17.709> 30<00:04:18.130> or<00:04:18.459> 60<00:04:18.729> frames<00:04:19.060> second<00:04:19.630> anything<00:04:19.900> like

00:04:20.039 --> 00:04:20.049 
do 30 or 60 frames second anything like

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:22.680 
do 30 or 60 frames second anything like
that<00:04:20.190> so<00:04:21.190> I'm<00:04:21.340> just<00:04:21.519> going<00:04:21.639> to<00:04:21.700> use<00:04:21.880> 24<00:04:22.240> frames

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:22.690 
that so I'm just going to use 24 frames

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:24.540 
that so I'm just going to use 24 frames
per<00:04:22.870> second<00:04:23.370> okay

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:24.550 
per second okay

00:04:24.550 --> 00:04:28.920 
per second okay
the<00:04:25.450> next<00:04:25.750> thing<00:04:25.900> you<00:04:25.990> need<00:04:26.020> to<00:04:26.169> do<00:04:26.380> is<00:04:27.930> convert

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:33.160 
the frames in or they actually convert

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:36.900 
the frames in or they actually convert
the<00:04:33.310> clips<00:04:33.970> into<00:04:34.570> frames<00:04:35.639> so<00:04:36.639> now<00:04:36.729> you'll

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:36.910 
the clips into frames so now you'll
