Hugh<00:01:44.430> 238<00:01:44.909> and<00:01:45.060> next<00:01:45.990> I'm<00:01:46.110> going<00:01:46.200> to<00:01:46.259> set<00:01:46.470> the

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
Hugh 238 and next I'm going to set the

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.760 
Hugh 238 and next I'm going to set the
saturation<00:01:47.250> on<00:01:47.430> the<00:01:47.579> highlights<00:01:47.970> 220<00:01:48.509> and<00:01:49.320> on

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:49.770 
saturation on the highlights 220 and on

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:53.330 
saturation on the highlights 220 and on
the<00:01:50.340> shadows<00:01:50.970> 240<00:01:51.840> and<00:01:52.049> I<00:01:52.590> also<00:01:52.740> like<00:01:53.040> to<00:01:53.070> set

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:53.340 
the shadows 240 and I also like to set

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:55.910 
the shadows 240 and I also like to set
my<00:01:53.460> balance<00:01:53.880> to<00:01:54.030> be<00:01:54.119> negative<00:01:54.450> 15<00:01:54.990> so<00:01:55.710> it

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
my balance to be negative 15 so it

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.289 
my balance to be negative 15 so it
pushes<00:01:56.100> it<00:01:56.340> even<00:01:56.549> a<00:01:56.579> little<00:01:56.610> bit<00:01:56.759> more<00:01:57.000> towards

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299 
pushes it even a little bit more towards

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.690 
pushes it even a little bit more towards
the<00:01:57.540> mid-tones<00:01:57.899> and<00:01:58.049> shadows<00:01:58.549> so<00:01:59.549> now

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
the mid-tones and shadows so now

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.020 
the mid-tones and shadows so now
obviously<00:02:00.240> I<00:02:00.329> have<00:02:00.659> a<00:02:00.960> sepia-toned<00:02:01.850> black<00:02:02.850> and

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:03.030 
obviously I have a sepia-toned black and

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.880 
obviously I have a sepia-toned black and
white<00:02:03.149> albeit<00:02:03.899> a<00:02:03.930> little<00:02:03.960> bit<00:02:04.200> mild<00:02:04.439> sepia

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
white albeit a little bit mild sepia

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.100 
white albeit a little bit mild sepia
tone<00:02:05.100> but<00:02:05.369> that<00:02:05.549> is<00:02:05.670> how<00:02:05.820> I<00:02:05.850> like<00:02:06.119> them<00:02:06.149> so<00:02:07.020> I'm

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
tone but that is how I like them so I'm

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.330 
tone but that is how I like them so I'm
going<00:02:07.140> to<00:02:07.259> go<00:02:07.380> up<00:02:07.500> and<00:02:07.649> I'm<00:02:07.770> going<00:02:07.890> to<00:02:07.950> hit<00:02:08.039> save

split<00:02:11.280> toning<00:02:11.580> and<00:02:12.050> check<00:02:13.050> the<00:02:13.200> saturation

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
split toning and check the saturation

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:16.670 
split toning and check the saturation
box<00:02:14.010> and<00:02:14.370> I'm<00:02:14.940> going<00:02:15.060> to<00:02:15.090> hit<00:02:15.210> save<00:02:15.450> and<00:02:15.750> this

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:18.600 
one I'm going to name black-and-white

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:27.830 
one I'm going to name black-and-white
sepia<00:02:18.930> tone<00:02:25.580> so<00:02:26.580> the<00:02:26.940> reason<00:02:27.090> why<00:02:27.330> I<00:02:27.360> checked

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
sepia tone so the reason why I checked

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.900 
sepia tone so the reason why I checked
the<00:02:28.200> split<00:02:28.650> toning<00:02:28.860> box<00:02:29.190> on<00:02:29.400> the<00:02:29.460> first<00:02:29.670> one

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
the split toning box on the first one

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.460 
the split toning box on the first one
even<00:02:30.300> though<00:02:30.420> I<00:02:30.450> hadn't<00:02:30.810> made<00:02:30.900> any<00:02:30.930> changes<00:02:31.110> to

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:31.470 
even though I hadn't made any changes to

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.920 
even though I hadn't made any changes to
it<00:02:31.650> is<00:02:31.800> so<00:02:32.490> that<00:02:32.640> when<00:02:32.730> I<00:02:32.760> go<00:02:32.940> to<00:02:32.970> apply<00:02:33.330> preset

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:33.930 
it is so that when I go to apply preset

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:36.140 
it is so that when I go to apply preset
now<00:02:34.170> if<00:02:34.350> I<00:02:34.440> choose<00:02:34.620> neutral<00:02:35.100> it<00:02:35.550> will<00:02:35.790> take<00:02:36.000> the

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:36.150 
now if I choose neutral it will take the

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.450 
now if I choose neutral it will take the
toning<00:02:36.480> away<00:02:36.690> if<00:02:37.380> it<00:02:37.530> had<00:02:37.680> been<00:02:37.710> toned<00:02:38.100> already

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:38.460 
toning away if it had been toned already

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:41.570 
toning away if it had been toned already
and<00:02:38.640> if<00:02:39.180> i<00:02:39.330> go<00:02:39.510> to<00:02:39.540> sepia<00:02:40.310> obviously<00:02:41.310> i'm<00:02:41.400> back

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
and if i go to sepia obviously i'm back

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.970 
and if i go to sepia obviously i'm back
to<00:02:41.730> sepia<00:02:42.170> next<00:02:43.170> if<00:02:43.290> you<00:02:43.410> did<00:02:43.530> just<00:02:43.560> want<00:02:43.860> to

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:43.980 
to sepia next if you did just want to

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.860 
to sepia next if you did just want to
say<00:02:44.040> to<00:02:44.100> a<00:02:44.220> warm<00:02:44.790> tone<00:02:45.000> black<00:02:45.270> and<00:02:45.450> white<00:02:45.570> not

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
say to a warm tone black and white not

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.420 
say to a warm tone black and white not
something<00:02:46.170> not<00:02:46.320> quite<00:02:46.470> as<00:02:46.650> strong<00:02:46.890> as<00:02:47.040> a<00:02:47.130> sepia

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:47.430 
something not quite as strong as a sepia

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.250 
something not quite as strong as a sepia
you<00:02:47.940> would<00:02:48.090> just<00:02:48.209> knock<00:02:48.510> that<00:02:48.690> saturation

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.260 
you would just knock that saturation

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.040 
you would just knock that saturation
down<00:02:49.590> to<00:02:49.800> about<00:02:49.980> 10<00:02:50.400> on<00:02:50.640> both<00:02:51.420> the<00:02:51.630> highlights

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.050 
down to about 10 on both the highlights

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:53.900 
down to about 10 on both the highlights
and<00:02:52.170> the<00:02:52.290> shadows<00:02:52.320> and<00:02:52.860> set<00:02:53.400> your<00:02:53.489> balance

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:53.910 
and the shadows and set your balance

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.570 
and the shadows and set your balance
back<00:02:54.090> to<00:02:54.330> zero<00:02:54.600> which<00:02:54.900> is<00:02:54.959> even<00:02:55.380> so<00:02:56.130> now<00:02:56.250> we<00:02:56.340> do

00:02:56.570 --> 00:02:56.580 
back to zero which is even so now we do

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.420 
back to zero which is even so now we do
have<00:02:56.610> a<00:02:57.200> slightly<00:02:58.200> warm<00:02:58.650> tone<00:02:58.890> black<00:02:59.190> and

00:02:59.420 --> 00:02:59.430 
have a slightly warm tone black and

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:01.640 
have a slightly warm tone black and
white<00:02:59.580> it<00:02:59.790> should<00:03:00.000> be<00:03:00.150> just<00:03:00.180> enough<00:03:00.630> to<00:03:00.959> stop<00:03:01.620> a

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
white it should be just enough to stop a

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:04.130 
white it should be just enough to stop a
color<00:03:01.980> print<00:03:02.310> from<00:03:02.489> going<00:03:02.850> to<00:03:03.090> one<00:03:03.720> direction

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140

cool<00:03:28.719> tone<00:03:28.900> image<00:03:29.140> well<00:03:29.500> you<00:03:29.709> can<00:03:29.859> do<00:03:30.040> that<00:03:30.069> too

00:03:30.509 --> 00:03:30.519 
cool tone image well you can do that too

00:03:30.519 --> 00:03:32.699 
cool tone image well you can do that too
we're<00:03:31.450> going<00:03:31.599> to<00:03:31.659> go<00:03:31.780> ahead<00:03:31.900> and<00:03:32.079> change<00:03:32.409> the

00:03:32.699 --> 00:03:32.709 
we're going to go ahead and change the

we're going to go ahead and change the
hue<00:03:32.950> to<00:03:33.659> 256<00:03:35.099> just<00:03:36.099> because<00:03:36.250> that's<00:03:36.400> a<00:03:36.579> nice

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:37.170 
hue to 256 just because that's a nice

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:39.990 
hue to 256 just because that's a nice
cool<00:03:38.170> tone<00:03:38.439> obviously<00:03:39.400> you<00:03:39.519> can<00:03:39.640> kind<00:03:39.849> of<00:03:39.909> go

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:40.000 
cool tone obviously you can kind of go

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.429 
cool tone obviously you can kind of go
through<00:03:40.209> the<00:03:40.299> cool<00:03:40.510> tones<00:03:40.750> and<00:03:40.930> find<00:03:41.140> the<00:03:41.290> one

00:03:41.429 --> 00:03:41.439 
through the cool tones and find the one
