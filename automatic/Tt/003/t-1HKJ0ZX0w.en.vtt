00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:02.829 
how to prepare them for finals footy but

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:05.039 
how to prepare them for finals footy but
it<00:02:03.009> is<00:02:03.159> a<00:02:03.189> shocker<00:02:03.700> of<00:02:03.939> a<00:02:04.030> run<00:02:04.240> we've<00:02:04.810> given

00:02:05.039 --> 00:02:05.049 
it is a shocker of a run we've given

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:06.719 
it is a shocker of a run we've given
them<00:02:05.200> one<00:02:05.259> game<00:02:05.679> that's<00:02:05.920> against<00:02:06.159> the<00:02:06.310> broncos

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:06.729 
them one game that's against the broncos

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:08.609 
them one game that's against the broncos
because<00:02:07.179> it's<00:02:07.329> in<00:02:07.479> Sydney<00:02:07.899> and<00:02:08.080> even<00:02:08.440> that's

00:02:08.609 --> 00:02:08.619 
because it's in Sydney and even that's

00:02:08.619 --> 00:02:11.100 
because it's in Sydney and even that's
no<00:02:08.860> no<00:02:09.399> gimme<00:02:09.670> either<00:02:09.910> so<00:02:10.270> we<00:02:10.690> reckon<00:02:10.989> they'll

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:11.110 
no no gimme either so we reckon they'll

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:13.259 
no no gimme either so we reckon they'll
probably<00:02:11.319> end<00:02:11.500> up<00:02:11.590> at<00:02:11.739> the<00:02:12.099> bottom<00:02:12.310> end<00:02:12.879> of<00:02:13.060> the

00:02:13.259 --> 00:02:13.269 
probably end up at the bottom end of the

00:02:13.269 --> 00:02:15.119 
probably end up at the bottom end of the
top<00:02:13.420> eight<00:02:13.659> yeah<00:02:14.110> they<00:02:14.260> got<00:02:14.349> the<00:02:14.470> Cowboys<00:02:14.950> of

00:02:15.119 --> 00:02:15.129 
top eight yeah they got the Cowboys of

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:16.440 
top eight yeah they got the Cowboys of
course<00:02:15.400> this<00:02:15.640> week<00:02:15.849> they've<00:02:16.090> got<00:02:16.269> the

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:16.450 
course this week they've got the

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.690 
course this week they've got the
roosters<00:02:16.840> as<00:02:16.959> well<00:02:17.110> so<00:02:17.470> look<00:02:17.980> it's<00:02:18.160> very<00:02:18.220> hard

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
roosters as well so look it's very hard

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.250 
roosters as well so look it's very hard
for<00:02:18.760> SAS<00:02:19.090> again<00:02:19.450> if<00:02:19.569> you<00:02:19.660> can<00:02:19.780> win<00:02:19.989> some<00:02:20.230> of

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.260 
for SAS again if you can win some of

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:21.930

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:21.940 
those games and going on a high then

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:23.610 
those games and going on a high then
that's<00:02:22.120> fantastic<00:02:22.750> for<00:02:22.810> the<00:02:22.989> Premier's<00:02:23.410> but
