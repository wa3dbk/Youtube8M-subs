alright<00:00:00.719> quadcopter<00:00:01.469> 101<00:00:01.920> here<00:00:02.190> if<00:00:02.909> you<00:00:03.030> look

00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:03.149 
alright quadcopter 101 here if you look

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:04.999 
alright quadcopter 101 here if you look
up<00:00:03.330> in<00:00:03.419> the<00:00:03.480> sky<00:00:03.659> you<00:00:03.810> see<00:00:03.990> a<00:00:04.140> big<00:00:04.380> oval<00:00:04.830> up

00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:05.009 
up in the sky you see a big oval up

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:06.769 
up in the sky you see a big oval up
there<00:00:05.279> I<00:00:05.310> think<00:00:05.640> we're<00:00:05.759> doing<00:00:05.910> a<00:00:06.270> test<00:00:06.509> flight

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:06.779 
there I think we're doing a test flight

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:09.950 
there I think we're doing a test flight
of<00:00:06.930> the<00:00:07.560> new<00:00:08.099> spaceship<00:00:08.849> three<00:00:09.330> down<00:00:09.809> in

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:09.960 
of the new spaceship three down in

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.320 
of the new spaceship three down in
Mojave<00:00:10.260> airport<00:00:10.830> I<00:00:11.040> guess<00:00:11.940> they<00:00:12.120> lost

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
Mojave airport I guess they lost

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.110 
Mojave airport I guess they lost
spaceship<00:00:12.809> to<00:00:13.049> hear<00:00:13.370> nearby<00:00:14.370> here<00:00:14.670> about<00:00:14.849> 20

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:15.120 
spaceship to hear nearby here about 20

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:17.570 
spaceship to hear nearby here about 20
miles<00:00:15.299> from<00:00:15.420> here<00:00:15.719> a<00:00:16.199> couple<00:00:16.710> months<00:00:16.949> back<00:00:17.250> but

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
miles from here a couple months back but

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:19.099 
miles from here a couple months back but
it<00:00:18.300> looks<00:00:18.449> like<00:00:18.570> they're<00:00:18.720> getting<00:00:18.810> ready<00:00:18.960> to

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:19.109 
it looks like they're getting ready to

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:20.929 
it looks like they're getting ready to
do<00:00:19.230> another<00:00:19.260> test<00:00:19.740> but<00:00:20.310> I'm<00:00:20.430> also<00:00:20.670> getting

00:00:20.929 --> 00:00:20.939 
do another test but I'm also getting

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:22.310 
do another test but I'm also getting
ready<00:00:21.180> to<00:00:21.300> do<00:00:21.420> a<00:00:21.449> test<00:00:21.720> out<00:00:21.960> here<00:00:22.170> in<00:00:22.230> the

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:22.320 
ready to do a test out here in the

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.839 
ready to do a test out here in the
desert<00:00:22.760> this<00:00:23.760> is<00:00:23.880> my<00:00:24.000> jgr<00:00:24.510> hhc<00:00:25.260> last<00:00:26.189> week<00:00:26.519> I

00:00:26.839 --> 00:00:26.849 
desert this is my jgr hhc last week I

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:29.750 
desert this is my jgr hhc last week I
was<00:00:27.359> flying<00:00:27.599> my<00:00:27.840> hhc<00:00:28.439> up<00:00:28.740> in<00:00:28.949> short<00:00:29.250> canyon

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:29.760 
was flying my hhc up in short canyon

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.060 
was flying my hhc up in short canyon
looking<00:00:30.599> at<00:00:30.720> the<00:00:31.019> wildflowers<00:00:31.619> up<00:00:31.859> there

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
looking at the wildflowers up there

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.430 
looking at the wildflowers up there
California<00:00:32.730> poppies<00:00:33.180> but<00:00:33.690> I<00:00:33.719> was<00:00:33.930> using<00:00:34.110> a

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440 
California poppies but I was using a

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.190 
California poppies but I was using a
slow<00:00:34.829> memory<00:00:35.340> card<00:00:35.760> with<00:00:36.030> the<00:00:36.270> quadcopter

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:37.200 
slow memory card with the quadcopter

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.860 
slow memory card with the quadcopter
with<00:00:37.710> the<00:00:37.860> camera<00:00:38.219> and<00:00:39.059> because<00:00:39.570> of<00:00:39.600> that<00:00:39.780> I

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:39.870 
with the camera and because of that I

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.170 
with the camera and because of that I
was<00:00:40.079> getting<00:00:40.379> a<00:00:40.469> lot<00:00:40.649> of<00:00:40.680> dropped<00:00:41.010> frames<00:00:41.180> what

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180 
was getting a lot of dropped frames what

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.569 
was getting a lot of dropped frames what
I<00:00:42.210> got<00:00:42.420> today<00:00:42.570> is<00:00:42.870> a<00:00:43.110> put<00:00:43.320> a<00:00:43.350> class<00:00:43.680> 6<00:00:44.070> card<00:00:44.430> in

00:00:44.569 --> 00:00:44.579 
I got today is a put a class 6 card in

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:46.549 
I got today is a put a class 6 card in
there<00:00:44.760> a<00:00:44.789> faster<00:00:45.210> memory<00:00:45.570> card<00:00:45.960> and<00:00:46.140> I'm

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
there a faster memory card and I'm

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.350 
there a faster memory card and I'm
hoping<00:00:46.860> that's<00:00:47.010> able<00:00:47.340> to<00:00:47.550> keep<00:00:47.700> up<00:00:47.910> with<00:00:47.969> the

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
hoping that's able to keep up with the

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.850 
hoping that's able to keep up with the
speed<00:00:48.600> of<00:00:48.899> the<00:00:49.050> camera<00:00:49.350> and<00:00:49.379> that's<00:00:49.680> what

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
speed of the camera and that's what

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.069 
speed of the camera and that's what
today's<00:00:50.100> test<00:00:50.430> flight<00:00:50.640> is<00:00:50.760> going<00:00:50.969> to<00:00:51.059> do<00:00:51.180> is<00:00:51.360> to

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
today's test flight is going to do is to

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.709 
today's test flight is going to do is to
test<00:00:52.350> the<00:00:52.649> speed<00:00:52.980> of<00:00:53.309> the<00:00:53.460> class<00:00:53.850> 6<00:00:54.149> card<00:00:54.449> in

00:00:54.709 --> 00:00:54.719 
test the speed of the class 6 card in

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:56.990 
test the speed of the class 6 card in
this<00:00:55.199> camera<00:00:55.590> so<00:00:56.160> let's<00:00:56.460> see<00:00:56.579> if<00:00:56.640> that<00:00:56.699> works

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000 
this camera so let's see if that works

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.549 
this camera so let's see if that works
I'm<00:00:57.329> going<00:00:57.480> to<00:00:57.539> send<00:00:57.690> it<00:00:57.780> up<00:00:57.930> I'm<00:00:58.260> going<00:00:58.379> to<00:00:58.440> do

there's<00:01:57.520> a<00:01:57.579> wind<00:01:57.789> up<00:01:57.880> there<00:01:58.149> pushing<00:01:58.420> it<00:01:58.659> by

00:01:58.830 --> 00:01:58.840 
there's a wind up there pushing it by

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.600 
there's a wind up there pushing it by
that's<00:01:59.110> that's<00:01:59.619> the<00:01:59.799> wind<00:01:59.979> pushing<00:02:00.340> it<00:02:00.460> right

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:00.610 
that's that's the wind pushing it right

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:05.429 
that's that's the wind pushing it right
now<00:02:03.270> still<00:02:04.270> I'm<00:02:04.509> just<00:02:04.570> still<00:02:04.899> hovering<00:02:05.200> right

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:05.439 
now still I'm just still hovering right

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:10.410 
now still I'm just still hovering right
now<00:02:08.160> okay<00:02:09.160> I<00:02:09.220> better<00:02:09.429> fight<00:02:09.670> that<00:02:09.880> when<00:02:10.090> going

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:10.420 
now okay I better fight that when going

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:15.270 
now okay I better fight that when going
upwind<00:02:10.929> now<00:02:13.140> okay<00:02:14.140> I'm<00:02:14.260> coming<00:02:14.440> down<00:02:14.769> I'm<00:02:15.069> too

upwind now okay I'm coming down I'm too

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:16.890 
upwind now okay I'm coming down I'm too
high<00:02:15.459> I<00:02:15.489> don't<00:02:15.790> want<00:02:15.910> to<00:02:16.000> be<00:02:16.090> way<00:02:16.269> up<00:02:16.420> there<00:02:16.450> now

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:16.900 
high I don't want to be way up there now

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.460 
high I don't want to be way up there now
to<00:02:17.560> keep<00:02:17.709> it<00:02:17.830> blow<00:02:17.980> for<00:02:18.220> our<00:02:18.370> feet<00:02:18.549> right<00:02:18.760> folks

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
to keep it blow for our feet right folks

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.690 
to keep it blow for our feet right folks
and<00:02:20.470> now<00:02:20.860> i'm<00:02:21.069> going<00:02:21.190> to<00:02:21.280> be<00:02:21.370> doing<00:02:21.549> a

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:21.700 
and now i'm going to be doing a

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:34.740 
and now i'm going to be doing a
low-level<00:02:22.540> flying

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:43.100 

No

yeah this modification and SEBI duck you
did<00:02:45.510> a<00:02:45.540> real<00:02:45.870> nice<00:02:46.020> documentation<00:02:46.830> how<00:02:46.950> to<00:02:47.010> do

00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:47.220 
did a real nice documentation how to do

00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:49.760 
did a real nice documentation how to do
it<00:02:47.400> with<00:02:47.970> this<00:02:48.120> transmitter<00:02:48.750> it<00:02:49.260> works<00:02:49.530> great

a<00:03:13.850> little<00:03:14.850> bit<00:03:14.940> of<00:03:14.970> climbing<00:03:15.210> now<00:03:15.990> again<00:03:16.290> I'm

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:16.620 
a little bit of climbing now again I'm

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:19.130 
a little bit of climbing now again I'm
using<00:03:16.650> a<00:03:16.890> class<00:03:17.100> 6<00:03:17.340> card<00:03:17.670> the<00:03:18.660> way<00:03:18.750> you<00:03:18.810> find

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
using a class 6 card the way you find

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.980 
using a class 6 card the way you find
out<00:03:19.290> the<00:03:19.740> speed<00:03:20.040> of<00:03:20.220> your<00:03:20.340> card<00:03:20.760> you<00:03:21.630> look<00:03:21.810> on

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:21.990 
out the speed of your card you look on

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:24.350 
out the speed of your card you look on
it<00:03:22.170> look<00:03:22.740> first<00:03:22.980> little<00:03:23.370> see<00:03:23.640> on<00:03:23.910> your<00:03:24.060> card

00:03:24.350 --> 00:03:24.360 
it look first little see on your card

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:27.290 
it look first little see on your card
and<00:03:24.600> look<00:03:25.500> for<00:03:25.710> a<00:03:25.740> number<00:03:26.070> of<00:03:26.220> 6<00:03:26.520> or<00:03:26.700> higher<00:03:26.730> I

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:27.300 
and look for a number of 6 or higher I

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:29.900 
and look for a number of 6 or higher I
you<00:03:27.900> mates<00:03:28.200> most<00:03:28.950> of<00:03:29.100> them<00:03:29.220> are<00:03:29.310> class<00:03:29.610> fours

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:29.910 
you mates most of them are class fours

you mates most of them are class fours
if<00:03:30.240> you<00:03:30.360> see<00:03:30.540> c4<00:03:31.140> if<00:03:31.380> you<00:03:31.950> see<00:03:32.130> no<00:03:32.310> see<00:03:32.550> at<00:03:32.670> all

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:33.650 
if you see c4 if you see no see at all

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:36.770 
if you see c4 if you see no see at all
that's<00:03:34.650> less<00:03:35.400> than<00:03:35.430> 2<00:03:35.760> megabyte<00:03:36.180> per<00:03:36.390> second

00:03:36.770 --> 00:03:36.780 
that's less than 2 megabyte per second

00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:38.150 
that's less than 2 megabyte per second
and<00:03:36.870> that's<00:03:36.990> what<00:03:37.320> comes<00:03:37.770> with<00:03:38.010> this

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160 
and that's what comes with this

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.100 
and that's what comes with this
quadcopter<00:03:38.520> it's<00:03:39.120> just<00:03:39.300> too<00:03:39.420> slow<00:03:39.720> for<00:03:39.750> this

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:40.110 
quadcopter it's just too slow for this

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:42.800 
quadcopter it's just too slow for this
camera<00:03:40.350> it's<00:03:40.950> a<00:03:41.010> very<00:03:41.190> good<00:03:41.280> camera<00:03:41.850> but<00:03:42.570> again

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:42.810 
camera it's a very good camera but again

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:45.260 
camera it's a very good camera but again
it<00:03:42.900> uses<00:03:43.200> motion<00:03:43.560> jpeg<00:03:43.770> which<00:03:44.220> is<00:03:44.400> an<00:03:44.610> older

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:45.270 
it uses motion jpeg which is an older

00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:49.699 
it uses motion jpeg which is an older
compression<00:03:45.810> format<00:03:46.520> which<00:03:47.520> requires<00:03:48.709> it

00:03:49.699 --> 00:03:49.709 
compression format which requires it

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:51.440 
compression format which requires it
actually<00:03:50.040> makes<00:03:50.190> a<00:03:50.310> very<00:03:50.550> large<00:03:50.820> data<00:03:50.940> file

00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:51.450 
actually makes a very large data file

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:54.350 
actually makes a very large data file
and<00:03:51.770> to<00:03:52.770> keep<00:03:52.950> up<00:03:53.190> with<00:03:53.370> that<00:03:53.489> data<00:03:53.940> stream

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:54.360 
and to keep up with that data stream

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:58.729 
and to keep up with that data stream
from<00:03:54.600> that<00:03:54.780> card<00:03:55.080> you<00:03:55.950> need<00:03:56.100> a<00:03:56.130> fast<00:03:56.400> card<00:03:57.739> data

00:03:58.729 --> 00:03:58.739 
from that card you need a fast card data

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:01.699 
from that card you need a fast card data
