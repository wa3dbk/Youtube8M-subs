00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:08.800
 the hydraulic power steering employs 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:10.720
 a rotary valve sandwiched between 

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:13.150
 the pinion that drives the rack and the 

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:15.670
 Steering column rotary valve 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:17.590
 regulates the distribution of pressure to the left 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:19.539
 and right of the hydraulic cylinder in the 

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:22.420
 that we have converted to the zipper of 

00:00:19.539 --> 00:00:24.610
 direction the pressure changes in 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:27.130
 both cameras generate a force at 

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:29.020
 length of the zipper this difference 

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:30.580
 of pressure becomes a force 

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:33.390
 that generates assistance to the management 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:33.390
 Required 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.960
 electric power steering employs 

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:45.030
 an electric motor 

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.920
 generally mounted on the cane of the 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.440
 direction in the pinion that drives the 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:52.370
 zipper or as in this case on the 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.370
 own zipper 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.000
 immediately on the pinion that attacks 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.280
 the rack is located the torque sensor 

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.110
 of the address whose work consists of 

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.730
 measure the torque that is exerting the 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:05.710
 driver on the steering wheel to 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:08.500
 determine the amount of assistance 

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.479
 necessary the movement is transmitted to 

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.190
 through a belt to a gear of 

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:15.500
 balls recirculate test 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:17.480
 the parco Munich sensor with the engine 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:21.220
 of the power steering that integrates 

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:21.220
 all electronic address 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.210
 the active direction by means of gear x 

00:01:30.409 --> 00:01:34.610
 ideal cycle was a technology 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:37.640
 introduced by bmw in series 5 of 

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.259
 2003 an electric motor drives a 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:43.119
 gear that allows you to add or subtract 

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:43.119
 turning angles to the direction 

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:01.310
 at low speed the electric motor 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:03.530
 supplements the driver's turn in this 

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.390
 modality the address responds as a 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:09.100
 conventional direction with only two 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:09.100
 steering wheel turns between buffers 

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:17.840
 at high speed the electric motor 

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:20.510
 subtract the instructions from the 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.730
 driver in this situation the address 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:24.829
 it behaves as if it had almost six 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:26.510
 turns of wheel between stops and the 

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:30.159
 driver has an impression of 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.159
 Greater precision and stability 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:44.640
 other manufacturers such as lexus and audi 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:47.130
 they use a much more drive 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.910
 compact based on a train engine 

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:49.910
 elliptical wave 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:56.730
 despite its complex name the 

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:59.269
 operating principle is very 

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:59.269
 simple 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:07.829
 a motor spins a ring gear 

00:03:05.969 --> 00:03:10.969
 elliptical that meshes on a pinion 

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:10.969
 cylindrical interior 

00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:17.520
 the difference between the length of the 

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.860
 perimeter of the ellipse and of the 

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:22.080
 circumference makes for every turn 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.760
 complete external ellipse is added or 

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.270
 Remove a little bit of rotation from the cylinder 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.270
 inside
