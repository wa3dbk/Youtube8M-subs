as<00:01:52.280> well<00:01:52.310> oh<00:01:52.670> definitely<00:01:53.120> I<00:01:53.480> think<00:01:53.800> Korea

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:54.800 
as well oh definitely I think Korea

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.560 
as well oh definitely I think Korea
itself<00:01:55.220> just<00:01:55.640> being<00:01:56.090> in<00:01:56.180> that<00:01:56.300> kind<00:01:56.510> of

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:56.570 
itself just being in that kind of

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.630 
itself just being in that kind of
training<00:01:56.780> atmosphere<00:01:57.530> he'll<00:01:58.130> improve<00:01:58.250> like

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
training atmosphere he'll improve like

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.060 
training atmosphere he'll improve like
so<00:01:58.850> much<00:01:59.030> and<00:01:59.510> I<00:01:59.720> think<00:01:59.900> that's<00:02:00.080> a<00:02:00.290> an

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:01.070 
so much and I think that's a an

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:02.380 
so much and I think that's a an
opportunity<00:02:01.700> that<00:02:01.730> wouldn't<00:02:02.090> mind<00:02:02.150> taking

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:02.390 
opportunity that wouldn't mind taking

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:05.860 
opportunity that wouldn't mind taking
myself<00:02:02.920> alright<00:02:03.920> so<00:02:04.250> what<00:02:04.820> what<00:02:05.480> what<00:02:05.690> do<00:02:05.750> they

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:05.870 
myself alright so what what what do they

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:07.390 
myself alright so what what what do they
do<00:02:05.930> differently<00:02:06.350> over<00:02:06.410> there<00:02:06.680> that<00:02:06.800> you<00:02:07.220> can't

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:07.400 
do differently over there that you can't

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.389 
do differently over there that you can't
do<00:02:07.520> here<00:02:07.730> like<00:02:08.030> I<00:02:08.600> think<00:02:09.320> it<00:02:09.530> helps<00:02:09.680> what<00:02:10.310> you

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
do here like I think it helps what you

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:12.370 
do here like I think it helps what you
put<00:02:10.670> like<00:02:10.910> an<00:02:11.090> entire<00:02:11.450> team<00:02:11.750> in<00:02:11.960> the<00:02:12.020> one<00:02:12.170> house

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:12.380 
put like an entire team in the one house

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.350 
put like an entire team in the one house

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:36.870 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.119 

I'm<00:02:37.349> not<00:02:37.560> really<00:02:37.709> afraid<00:02:37.860> of<00:02:38.010> any<00:02:38.220> Terran<00:02:38.549> fire

00:02:40.119 --> 00:02:40.129

00:02:40.129 --> 00:02:42.710 
I'm not really afraid of any Terran fire
up<00:02:41.129> until<00:02:41.489> recently<00:02:41.640> I<00:02:42.000> was<00:02:42.209> worried<00:02:42.450> about<00:02:42.480> my

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
up until recently I was worried about my

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.039 
up until recently I was worried about my
TV<00:02:43.049> p<00:02:43.260> so<00:02:44.159> I<00:02:44.640> guess<00:02:45.030> before<00:02:45.330> I<00:02:45.569> might<00:02:45.840> have<00:02:45.930> been

00:02:46.039 --> 00:02:46.049 
TV p so I guess before I might have been

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:47.600 
TV p so I guess before I might have been
afraid<00:02:46.260> to<00:02:46.319> play<00:02:46.500> hero<00:02:46.769> and<00:02:47.129> I<00:02:47.190> did<00:02:47.340> play<00:02:47.519> him

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:47.610 
afraid to play hero and I did play him

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:48.850 
afraid to play hero and I did play him
in<00:02:47.700> the<00:02:47.790> clan<00:02:48.000> war

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:48.860 
in the clan war

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:51.810 
in the clan war
and<00:02:49.100> that<00:02:49.460> match<00:02:49.640> is<00:02:49.850> actually<00:02:50.420> pretty<00:02:50.570> close

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:51.820 
and that match is actually pretty close

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:54.670 
and that match is actually pretty close
so<00:02:52.820> right<00:02:53.000> now<00:02:53.030> I<00:02:53.120> think<00:02:53.210> I<00:02:53.480> can<00:02:53.630> take<00:02:53.780> have<00:02:54.620> a

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:54.680 
so right now I think I can take have a

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.980 
so right now I think I can take have a
good<00:02:54.860> chance<00:02:55.070> either<00:02:56.000> one<00:02:56.240> of<00:02:56.270> them<00:02:56.420> all<00:02:56.870> right

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:56.990 
good chance either one of them all right

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:58.300 
good chance either one of them all right
