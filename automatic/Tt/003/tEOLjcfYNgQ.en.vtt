 hello wine , how are you 

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:09.200
 I'm here to record for you a 

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:12.320
 tutorial on how to do the 

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:14.570
 Nice caring, it 's very practical and 

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:16.820
 you will understand how not to let 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:20.180
 seam type to become one. 

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:24.140
 Just to start, we'll start going. 

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:26.750
 use a fluffy one I've already done 

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:29.360
 video tutorial showing how to do it right? 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:31.900
 and then you will occupy the white hits I 

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:35.090
 I'm going to use coconut water and the ice cream is 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:37.820
 black enamel danger the né kit 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:42.079
 the extra brightness to finish the 

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:45.200
 stamp of konad m100 the florets and the 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:45.890
 plate of konad m51 this print of 

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.989
 tribal 

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:50.270
 but of course there you will be using 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:52.340
 here you wish to amend and here you 

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:54.890
 think it will work best 

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:57.590
 As I said the first step was to do 

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:01.280
 of Guinea 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:06.020
 We're going to start the stamp. Let's go. 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:09.260
 start with this samba and leave I go 

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:16.220
 give a focus here for you to see how 

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:18.590
 who will choose there on the side of the 

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:23.450
 If you want, I want to get this 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:26.659
 big flower cap and you will see how it is 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:32.900
 practical took in favor 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:35.030
 You come here close and carefully to 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:39.580
 People to get this part right 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.580
 here to be nice, work 

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:45.890
 come on clean remains the same 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:47.360
 or if you prefer to make a 

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.280
 package as I already have a certain 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.259
 practice, I keep the same 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:53.659
 here we will reverse and we will 

00:01:51.259 --> 00:01:56.030
 put the stamp on the voice part let's 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:57.920
 do a pretty cool deal as it goes 

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.409
 be assumed to be the same 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:03.970
 we can give you an idea is reversed 

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:03.970
 in the affection that will not get polluted 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:11.750
 the time to stamp on the top 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:15.250
 you exercise a little more pressure from the 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:21.050
 The people who give it to her are 100% 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:28.959
 naval had nail and cuticle beauty 

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:35.599
 here on the bottom do not move it 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:39.910
 now the truth takes a bigger piece nor 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:39.910
 damages are usually higher 

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.260
 Eliza 

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:50.569
 now we're going to get sick of it 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:52.250
 Brazil that is 51 

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:55.450
 You'll also get the part that you 

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:55.450
 to wish not 

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:07.940
 and here is the secret you have 

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:10.940
 where to go far to where it ended 

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:21.829
 flower stamp you already seam the stamp 

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:24.920
 I'm going to make a mind and approach now 

00:03:21.829 --> 00:03:32.090
 you come here 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:33.440
 the machine can not expect nor guarantee 

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:37.609
 that we will not have to take everything 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:45.160
 Let's do it again, got a stamp coming. 

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:49.310
 here still more attention and pressure 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:51.890
 look how cool she joins with the flower is 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:55.640
 a very fantastic thing to see 

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:59.239
 or two 

00:03:55.640 --> 00:04:01.540
 I mean, you say your drawing. 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:01.540
 new 

00:04:02.210 --> 00:04:10.640
 here mirow looks like people have error 

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:14.270
 ends up a bit in the pattern is 

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:29.390
 the result after it was really cool 

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:31.910
 come again picked up right here and so 

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:34.220
 it's a question of practicing people the question 

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:37.970
 of the amendment is practical you will have to have 

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:42.050
 a certain tone of me is not because what 

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:44.560
 send that stamp is the aim and so 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:46.760
 in practice you go from there practicing 

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:49.190
 wanting to learn course is so 

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:51.590
 things work and you will succeed 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:53.030
 the question of you practicing and then 

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:54.740
 gave the result after it was done 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:55.580
 It's a pretty good thing, you go. 

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:58.520
 to worship 

00:04:55.580 --> 00:05:01.000
 're now entering the part of the extra 

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:01.000
 brightness 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:12.440
 is that generous layer goes there goes 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:15.320
 spend very carefully because the 

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:17.660
 pattern can not smudge're identify 

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:19.460
 this cool and cool effect of the 

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:22.550
 gradient and what we do for our 

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:25.160
 black prints is that the band enters 

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:27.350
 inside the DVD looks like a work of 

00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:28.100
 Art I love the gradient loves to 

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:31.100
 gradient 

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:32.480
 no matter the subject gives because first 

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:34.760
 You can not think if she's going to stay. 

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:37.160
 too much to take me 

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:39.590
 this is the result né after falling from 

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:41.360
 a past trading card 

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:43.370
 now I'm going to clean because I'm not going 

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:45.800
 clean here for you because the gradient 

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:47.480
 requires some clean time for you 

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:49.400
 impact to be perfect for you 

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:51.260
 not withdraw the thugs then to 

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:53.030
 improve the video cleaned thing back 

00:05:51.260 --> 00:05:57.650
 showing the result when ready 

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:59.450
 I'll post it when it 's ready and clean. 

00:05:57.650 --> 00:06:01.610
 an important point that I forgot to 

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:03.140
 to emphasize before is that the 

00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:05.480
 Gradient in case it has to be well 

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:07.160
 It's up to you to be able to 

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:08.710
 force on the stamp and stay like that 

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:12.700
 perfect and not 

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:15.460
 it is in the case of attaching the stamp in the same 

00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:18.880
 vote on the baffle ring I 

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:20.410
 I do the same to the painting, I'll be there. 

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:22.570
 making a video contained explaining only 

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:24.880
 about him are we just like you 

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:26.410
 paint how you stamp and where to buy 

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:28.600
 of course 

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:31.660
 so this is it, people I want to thank
