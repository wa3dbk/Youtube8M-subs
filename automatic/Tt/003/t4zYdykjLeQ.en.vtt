if<00:00:08.519> you<00:00:08.730> could<00:00:08.940> develop<00:00:09.179> a<00:00:09.510> new<00:00:09.630> stakes<00:00:09.990> race

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.290 
if you could develop a new stakes race

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:12.140 
if you could develop a new stakes race
or<00:00:10.500> series<00:00:10.920> what<00:00:11.190> would<00:00:11.340> the<00:00:11.460> conditions<00:00:11.940> be

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.150 
or series what would the conditions be

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.900 
or series what would the conditions be
it<00:00:12.990> would<00:00:13.139> probably<00:00:13.440> be<00:00:13.920> some<00:00:14.519> kind<00:00:14.730> of<00:00:14.820> a

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:14.910 
it would probably be some kind of a

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.640 
it would probably be some kind of a
condition<00:00:15.420> race<00:00:15.690> for<00:00:16.020> two<00:00:16.440> and

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:16.650 
condition race for two and

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.370 
condition race for two and
three-year-olds<00:00:17.369> that<00:00:18.300> weren't<00:00:18.630> quite<00:00:19.170> good

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
three-year-olds that weren't quite good

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.759 
three-year-olds that weren't quite good
enough<00:00:19.439> of<00:00:19.710> the<00:00:19.770> open<00:00:20.039> stakes<00:00:20.990> just<00:00:21.990> some<00:00:22.560> kind

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
enough of the open stakes just some kind

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.080 
enough of the open stakes just some kind
of<00:00:22.830> a<00:00:22.920> non<00:00:23.100> winners<00:00:23.460> or<00:00:23.609> something<00:00:23.880> just<00:00:24.000> to

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
of a non winners or something just to

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.320 
of a non winners or something just to
give<00:00:24.300> those<00:00:24.420> horses<00:00:24.960> a<00:00:25.699> race<00:00:26.699> when<00:00:26.910> they<00:00:27.029> when

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:27.330 
give those horses a race when they when

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:30.800 
give those horses a race when they when
they<00:00:27.779> needed<00:00:28.019> it<00:00:28.199> that's<00:00:29.010> tough<00:00:29.220> for<00:00:30.179> maidens

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
they needed it that's tough for maidens

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.500 
they needed it that's tough for maidens
I<00:00:31.260> think<00:00:31.800> I<00:00:31.890> would<00:00:32.040> look<00:00:32.189> for<00:00:32.430> something<00:00:33.420> for

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:33.510 
I think I would look for something for

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.260 
I think I would look for something for
younger<00:00:33.809> trotters<00:00:34.260> and<00:00:34.730> especially<00:00:35.730> Phillies

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:36.270 
younger trotters and especially Phillies

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.880 
younger trotters and especially Phillies
because<00:00:36.660> there's<00:00:37.170> not<00:00:37.290> that<00:00:37.350> much<00:00:37.620> for

00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:37.890 
because there's not that much for

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:41.060 
because there's not that much for
fillies<00:00:38.430> I'd<00:00:39.329> like<00:00:39.480> to<00:00:39.510> see<00:00:39.750> a<00:00:39.780> race<00:00:39.989> for<00:00:40.230> trot

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
fillies I'd like to see a race for trot

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.830 
fillies I'd like to see a race for trot
and<00:00:41.250> mayor's<00:00:41.460> older<00:00:41.820> trot<00:00:42.030> and<00:00:42.180> mares<00:00:42.360> ago<00:00:42.629> for

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:42.840 
and mayor's older trot and mares ago for

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:44.240 
and mayor's older trot and mares ago for
for<00:00:43.230> big<00:00:43.379> money<00:00:43.530> other<00:00:43.829> than<00:00:43.860> just<00:00:44.100> the

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
for big money other than just the

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.920 
for big money other than just the
Breeders<00:00:44.610> Crown<00:00:44.760> would<00:00:45.360> be<00:00:45.450> nice<00:00:45.600> to<00:00:45.780> see

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
Breeders Crown would be nice to see

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.510 
Breeders Crown would be nice to see
older<00:00:46.410> trodden<00:00:46.739> mayor's<00:00:46.920> raced<00:00:47.190> a<00:00:47.309> little

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:47.520 
older trodden mayor's raced a little

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.660 
older trodden mayor's raced a little
longer<00:00:48.079> if<00:00:49.079> I<00:00:49.320> could<00:00:49.530> develop<00:00:49.829> a<00:00:50.129> new<00:00:50.309> state

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
longer if I could develop a new state

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:53.150 
longer if I could develop a new state
grace<00:00:50.969> or<00:00:51.210> a<00:00:51.239> series<00:00:51.750> of<00:00:51.989> state<00:00:52.500> graces<00:00:52.949> I

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
grace or a series of state graces I

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:56.750 
grace or a series of state graces I
would<00:00:53.460> probably<00:00:53.840> accommodate<00:00:54.840> more<00:00:55.440> to<00:00:56.039> aged

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
would probably accommodate more to aged

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.939 
would probably accommodate more to aged
trotting<00:00:57.629> mirrors<00:00:57.899> because<00:00:58.289> they<00:00:58.500> don't<00:00:58.829> get

00:00:58.939 --> 00:00:58.949 
trotting mirrors because they don't get

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:01.729 
trotting mirrors because they don't get
enough<00:00:59.219> races<00:00:59.730> i<00:00:59.850> think<00:01:00.170> probably<00:01:01.170> age

00:01:01.729 --> 00:01:01.739 
enough races i think probably age

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.929 
enough races i think probably age
trotters<00:01:02.780> I<00:01:03.780> like<00:01:04.530> the<00:01:04.769> open<00:01:05.369> like<00:01:05.820> the

00:01:05.929 --> 00:01:05.939 
trotters I like the open like the

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.670 
trotters I like the open like the

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:18.420 
horses race there's a new series I could

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.060 
horses race there's a new series I could
be<00:01:18.509> a<00:01:18.540> part<00:01:18.600> of<00:01:18.900> I'd<00:01:19.080> say<00:01:19.320> aids<00:01:19.560> taursus

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:20.070 
be a part of I'd say aids taursus

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:22.219 
be a part of I'd say aids taursus
something<00:01:20.400> more<00:01:20.640> be<00:01:21.330> track<00:01:21.600> circuit<00:01:21.840> for<00:01:22.140> aged

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:22.229 
something more be track circuit for aged

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.350 
something more be track circuit for aged
horses<00:01:22.740> there's<00:01:23.400> a<00:01:23.460> lot<00:01:23.520> of<00:01:23.610> young<00:01:23.850> steaks<00:01:24.150> and

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:24.360 
horses there's a lot of young steaks and

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.670 
horses there's a lot of young steaks and
a<00:01:24.390> lot<00:01:24.540> everything<00:01:24.900> else<00:01:25.020> out<00:01:25.200> there<00:01:25.470> but

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
a lot everything else out there but

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.140 
a lot everything else out there but
those<00:01:25.830> horses<00:01:26.159> don't<00:01:26.250> get<00:01:26.430> a<00:01:26.460> lot<00:01:26.580> of<00:01:26.640> chance<00:01:26.880> I

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:27.150 
those horses don't get a lot of chance I

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.149 
those horses don't get a lot of chance I
think<00:01:27.930> it<00:01:27.990> would<00:01:28.110> have<00:01:28.229> to<00:01:28.350> be<00:01:28.380> for<00:01:28.799> one<00:01:28.950> thing

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
think it would have to be for one thing

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:34.670 
think it would have to be for one thing
for<00:01:29.369> age<00:01:29.520> paces<00:01:30.180> and<00:01:32.930> they<00:01:33.930> have<00:01:34.079> to<00:01:34.229> leave<00:01:34.470> he

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
for age paces and they have to leave he

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.160 
for age paces and they have to leave he
there<00:01:34.950> at<00:01:35.100> yonkers<00:01:35.509> that<00:01:36.509> lasts<00:01:36.720> for<00:01:36.960> six

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
there at yonkers that lasts for six

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.899 
there at yonkers that lasts for six
weeks<00:01:37.380> I<00:01:37.740> would<00:01:38.250> love<00:01:38.400> to<00:01:38.460> have<00:01:38.640> something

never<00:01:59.880> thought<00:02:00.300> much<00:02:00.480> about<00:02:00.540> it<00:02:00.750> but<00:02:00.870> I<00:02:00.960> like

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:01.110 
never thought much about it but I like

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.180 
never thought much about it but I like
the<00:02:01.230> one<00:02:01.350> that<00:02:01.470> they're<00:02:01.620> doing<00:02:01.860> the<00:02:01.950> state's

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:02.190 
the one that they're doing the state's

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:03.680 
the one that they're doing the state's
out<00:02:02.400> with<00:02:02.520> those<00:02:02.640> free-for-all<00:02:03.240> Pacers<00:02:03.660> or

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:03.690 
out with those free-for-all Pacers or

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:04.760 
out with those free-for-all Pacers or
whatever<00:02:03.810> having<00:02:04.230> a<00:02:04.260> little<00:02:04.410> different<00:02:04.650> legs

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:04.770 
whatever having a little different legs

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.490 
whatever having a little different legs
so<00:02:05.630> nothing<00:02:06.630> I<00:02:06.660> can<00:02:06.810> take<00:02:06.960> credit<00:02:07.260> for<00:02:07.290> that

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:07.500 
so nothing I can take credit for that

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:10.010 
so nothing I can take credit for that
but<00:02:07.770> I<00:02:08.100> like<00:02:08.610> that<00:02:08.790> one<00:02:08.970> so<00:02:09.030> I'll<00:02:09.360> stay<00:02:09.690> out<00:02:09.720> I

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
but I like that one so I'll stay out I

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.040 
but I like that one so I'll stay out I
guess<00:02:10.260> I<00:02:10.649> I<00:02:11.310> definitely<00:02:11.910> think<00:02:12.150> girl<00:02:12.540> has<00:02:12.780> the

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
guess I I definitely think girl has the

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.190 
guess I I definitely think girl has the
right<00:02:13.980> step<00:02:14.430> in<00:02:14.640> making<00:02:15.120> four-year-old<00:02:15.780> races

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:16.200 
right step in making four-year-old races

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.420 
right step in making four-year-old races
and<00:02:16.410> trying<00:02:16.650> to<00:02:16.710> keep<00:02:16.860> horses<00:02:17.070> at<00:02:17.400> the

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:17.430 
and trying to keep horses at the

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:20.600 
and trying to keep horses at the
racetrack<00:02:18.000> so<00:02:18.360> I'd<00:02:18.930> say<00:02:19.260> Woodbine<00:02:20.190> I<00:02:20.550> know

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
racetrack so I'd say Woodbine I know

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.480 
racetrack so I'd say Woodbine I know
they've<00:02:20.880> done<00:02:21.030> a<00:02:21.060> great<00:02:21.270> job<00:02:21.300> having<00:02:21.720> a<00:02:21.900> lot<00:02:22.050> of

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:22.490 
they've done a great job having a lot of

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:25.040 
they've done a great job having a lot of
races<00:02:23.490> like<00:02:23.670> that<00:02:23.880> or<00:02:24.150> started<00:02:24.690> putting<00:02:24.900> them

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.050 
races like that or started putting them

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:28.400 
races like that or started putting them
in<00:02:25.230> but<00:02:25.830> to<00:02:25.950> keep<00:02:26.160> those<00:02:26.420> horses<00:02:27.420> in<00:02:27.600> into

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:28.410 
in but to keep those horses in into

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.290 
in but to keep those horses in into
racing<00:02:28.770> those<00:02:28.920> stallions<00:02:29.220> an<00:02:29.520> extra<00:02:29.820> year<00:02:30.060> and

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:30.300 
racing those stallions an extra year and

00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:33.710 
racing those stallions an extra year and
have<00:02:30.450> them<00:02:30.690> a<00:02:30.770> creative<00:02:31.770> fanbase<00:02:32.280> and<00:02:32.640> I<00:02:32.940> think

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:33.720 
have them a creative fanbase and I think

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.960 
have them a creative fanbase and I think
that'd<00:02:33.840> be<00:02:33.960> really<00:02:34.110> nice<00:02:34.850> definitely<00:02:35.850> for

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:35.970 
that'd be really nice definitely for

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:37.910 
that'd be really nice definitely for
older<00:02:36.330> horses<00:02:36.600> I<00:02:36.990> think<00:02:37.260> it's<00:02:37.380> difficult<00:02:37.740> to

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
older horses I think it's difficult to

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.350 
older horses I think it's difficult to
get<00:02:38.040> two<00:02:38.280> year<00:02:38.459> olds<00:02:38.700> to<00:02:38.820> the<00:02:38.910> races<00:02:39.240> in<00:02:39.330> the

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
get two year olds to the races in the

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.660 
get two year olds to the races in the
climate<00:02:39.630> we<00:02:39.900> live<00:02:40.080> in<00:02:40.230> so<00:02:41.100> four<00:02:41.370> year<00:02:41.490> olds

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:41.670 
climate we live in so four year olds

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.840 
climate we live in so four year olds
absolutely<00:02:42.740> ontario<00:02:43.740> sired<00:02:44.040> four<00:02:44.400> year<00:02:44.550> olds

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:44.850 
absolutely ontario sired four year olds

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:47.060 
absolutely ontario sired four year olds
would<00:02:45.000> be<00:02:45.150> all<00:02:45.270> right<00:02:45.450> for<00:02:45.510> that<00:02:45.810> just<00:02:46.290> for<00:02:46.650> up

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 
would be all right for that just for up

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:50.600 
would be all right for that just for up
here<00:02:48.140> it<00:02:49.140> helped<00:02:49.530> us<00:02:49.709> out<00:02:49.830> right<00:02:50.100> now<00:02:50.310> whether

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610 
here it helped us out right now whether

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:54.740 
here it helped us out right now whether
there's<00:02:50.850> still<00:02:51.030> tracks<00:02:51.330> or<00:02:51.540> not<00:02:53.570> turn<00:02:54.570> on

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
there's still tracks or not turn on

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.240 
there's still tracks or not turn on
where's<00:02:55.020> with<00:02:55.170> a<00:02:55.200> hundred<00:02:55.680> thousand<00:02:56.130> like

00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:56.250 
where's with a hundred thousand like

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.010 
where's with a hundred thousand like
some<00:02:56.520> ontario<00:02:56.970> cited<00:02:57.300> for<00:02:57.510> those<00:02:57.660> know<00:02:57.870> where

00:02:58.010 --> 00:02:58.020 
some ontario cited for those know where

00:02:58.020 --> 00:02:59.840 
some ontario cited for those know where
100,000<00:02:58.830> life<00:02:59.010> or<00:02:59.250> something<00:02:59.430> that<00:02:59.610> would<00:02:59.700> be

00:02:59.840 --> 00:02:59.850 
100,000 life or something that would be

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:01.430 
100,000 life or something that would be
a<00:02:59.880> good<00:03:00.209> one<00:03:00.360> I<00:03:00.420> think<00:03:00.540> that<00:03:01.200> would<00:03:01.260> be<00:03:01.410> a

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:01.440 
a good one I think that would be a

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:02.840 
a good one I think that would be a
four-year-old<00:03:01.950> state<00:03:02.250> grace<00:03:02.459> for<00:03:02.670> entry

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:02.850 
four-year-old state grace for entry

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:07.460 
four-year-old state grace for entry

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
Osiris I think a lot of a lot of Ontario

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:08.720 
Osiris I think a lot of a lot of Ontario

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:17.979 
state race for four-year-olds attorneys
are<00:03:14.900> probably<00:03:15.900> for<00:03:16.290> four-year-olds<00:03:16.769> like<00:03:17.580> the

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:17.989 
are probably for four-year-olds like the

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:21.009 
are probably for four-year-olds like the
not-so-good<00:03:18.989> ones<00:03:19.050> like<00:03:19.709> because<00:03:20.550> everyone

00:03:21.009 --> 00:03:21.019 
not-so-good ones like because everyone

has three year old years and just have a
34<00:03:24.510> year<00:03:24.540> old<00:03:24.780> OSS<00:03:25.590> or<00:03:26.040> something<00:03:26.400> like<00:03:26.489> that

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:26.550 
34 year old OSS or something like that

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:29.810 
34 year old OSS or something like that
it<00:03:27.450> would<00:03:27.630> be<00:03:27.780> for<00:03:28.019> OSS<00:03:28.650> horses<00:03:29.190> that<00:03:29.370> are<00:03:29.430> four

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:29.820 
it would be for OSS horses that are four

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:32.120 
it would be for OSS horses that are four
year<00:03:30.030> old<00:03:30.209> and<00:03:30.420> older<00:03:30.750> to<00:03:31.170> give<00:03:31.380> those<00:03:31.620> horses

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:32.130 
year old and older to give those horses

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:33.860 
year old and older to give those horses
a<00:03:32.160> chance<00:03:32.519> to<00:03:32.730> continue<00:03:33.150> to<00:03:33.390> race<00:03:33.600> in<00:03:33.780> the

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
a chance to continue to race in the

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:37.130 
a chance to continue to race in the
province<00:03:34.260> of<00:03:34.350> Ontario<00:03:34.830> I<00:03:35.420> think<00:03:36.420> I<00:03:36.510> personally

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.140 
province of Ontario I think I personally

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:39.830 
province of Ontario I think I personally
would<00:03:37.500> develop<00:03:38.220> for<00:03:38.700> Ontario<00:03:39.120> side<00:03:39.390> horses

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
would develop for Ontario side horses

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.540 
would develop for Ontario side horses
like<00:03:39.959> a<00:03:39.989> four-year-old<00:03:40.290> sire<00:03:40.860> stakes<00:03:41.130> program

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:41.550 
like a four-year-old sire stakes program

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:44.270 
like a four-year-old sire stakes program
just<00:03:42.120> give<00:03:42.390> them<00:03:42.510> more<00:03:42.690> opportunity<00:03:43.230> race<00:03:43.410> as

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:44.280 
just give them more opportunity race as

00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:47.060 
just give them more opportunity race as
they<00:03:44.459> go<00:03:44.580> on<00:03:44.700> maybe<00:03:45.570> for<00:03:45.840> Ontario's<00:03:46.380> sorry<00:03:46.980> or

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:47.070 
they go on maybe for Ontario's sorry or

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:49.729 
they go on maybe for Ontario's sorry or
four<00:03:47.250> year<00:03:47.400> old<00:03:47.519> so<00:03:47.670> it's<00:03:48.060> a

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739

that's<00:03:50.739> the<00:03:50.890> best<00:03:51.069> I<00:03:51.220> could<00:03:51.280> come<00:03:51.400> up<00:03:51.610> with<00:03:51.790> for

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:52.180 
that's the best I could come up with for

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:54.539 
that's the best I could come up with for
years<00:03:52.720> when<00:03:53.110> I<00:03:53.140> was<00:03:53.379> in<00:03:53.500> Ojai<00:03:53.799> I<00:03:54.010> tried<00:03:54.280> to<00:03:54.430> get

00:03:54.539 --> 00:03:54.549 
years when I was in Ojai I tried to get

00:03:54.549 --> 00:03:56.490 
years when I was in Ojai I tried to get
them<00:03:54.730> to<00:03:54.760> have<00:03:55.000> sire<00:03:55.659> stakes<00:03:55.959> for<00:03:56.200> four<00:03:56.379> and

them to have sire stakes for four and

them to have sire stakes for four and
five-year-olds<00:03:57.099> less<00:03:57.430> for<00:03:57.730> two-year-olds

five-year-olds less for two-year-olds

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.690 
five-year-olds less for two-year-olds
and<00:03:58.480> then<00:03:59.379> racist<00:04:00.280> for<00:04:00.400> four<00:04:00.459> and

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:00.700 
and then racist for four and

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:02.160 
and then racist for four and
five-year-olds<00:04:01.269> they<00:04:01.360> would<00:04:01.540> be<00:04:01.659> combined

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:02.170 
five-year-olds they would be combined

00:04:02.170 --> 00:04:03.569 
five-year-olds they would be combined
four<00:04:02.620> year<00:04:02.799> olds<00:04:02.950> and<00:04:03.040> five-year-olds<00:04:03.489> would

00:04:03.569 --> 00:04:03.579 
four year olds and five-year-olds would

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:06.119 
four year olds and five-year-olds would
race<00:04:03.760> together<00:04:03.939> but<00:04:04.420> I<00:04:04.450> and<00:04:05.019> they<00:04:05.739> say<00:04:05.980> the

00:04:06.119 --> 00:04:06.129 
race together but I and they say the

00:04:06.129 --> 00:04:07.589 
race together but I and they say the
breeding<00:04:06.430> farms<00:04:06.700> don't<00:04:06.909> want<00:04:07.090> it<00:04:07.209> but<00:04:07.359> I<00:04:07.390> don't

00:04:07.589 --> 00:04:07.599 
breeding farms don't want it but I don't

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:09.030 
breeding farms don't want it but I don't
see<00:04:07.810> why<00:04:07.959> they<00:04:08.170> would<00:04:08.200> when<00:04:08.650> they<00:04:08.769> sell<00:04:09.010> a

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:09.040 
see why they would when they sell a

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.130 
see why they would when they sell a
yearling<00:04:09.489> it<00:04:09.609> should<00:04:09.819> be<00:04:09.970> worth<00:04:10.150> more<00:04:10.480> if<00:04:10.720> it

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:11.140 
yearling it should be worth more if it

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:12.809 
yearling it should be worth more if it
can<00:04:11.319> still<00:04:11.590> race<00:04:11.799> and<00:04:12.010> stakes<00:04:12.280> as<00:04:12.459> a<00:04:12.489> foreign

00:04:12.809 --> 00:04:12.819 
can still race and stakes as a foreign

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:15.059 
can still race and stakes as a foreign
five-year-old<00:04:13.359> and<00:04:13.510> I<00:04:14.170> pushed<00:04:14.470> for<00:04:14.680> that<00:04:14.799> for

00:04:15.059 --> 00:04:15.069 
five-year-old and I pushed for that for

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:16.890 
five-year-old and I pushed for that for
years<00:04:15.250> but<00:04:15.519> I<00:04:15.579> couldn't<00:04:16.060> get<00:04:16.209> anybody<00:04:16.630> to

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:16.900 
years but I couldn't get anybody to

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:18.599 
years but I couldn't get anybody to
agree<00:04:17.259> with<00:04:17.410> me<00:04:17.470> and<00:04:17.769> they<00:04:17.949> used<00:04:18.160> to<00:04:18.310> do<00:04:18.459> it<00:04:18.579> in

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:18.609 
agree with me and they used to do it in

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:21.569 
agree with me and they used to do it in
New<00:04:18.699> York<00:04:19.060> and<00:04:19.329> I<00:04:20.289> don't<00:04:20.470> know<00:04:20.620> if<00:04:20.799> they<00:04:21.009> do<00:04:21.430> it

00:04:21.569 --> 00:04:21.579 
New York and I don't know if they do it

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:24.779 
New York and I don't know if they do it
now<00:04:21.760> but<00:04:22.030> at<00:04:22.120> one<00:04:22.330> time<00:04:22.570> they<00:04:22.780> did<00:04:22.990> but<00:04:23.800> I<00:04:24.130> think

00:04:24.779 --> 00:04:24.789 
now but at one time they did but I think

00:04:24.789 --> 00:04:26.070 
now but at one time they did but I think
there<00:04:24.940> should<00:04:25.060> be<00:04:25.240> four<00:04:25.419> and<00:04:25.479> five-year-old

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:26.080 
there should be four and five-year-old

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:29.370 
there should be four and five-year-old
sire<00:04:26.410> stakes<00:04:26.710> combined<00:04:27.280> and<00:04:27.960> less<00:04:28.960> for

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:29.380 
sire stakes combined and less for

00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:30.480 
sire stakes combined and less for
two-year-olds<00:04:29.680> I<00:04:29.860> don't<00:04:30.039> think<00:04:30.190> these<00:04:30.310> two

00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:30.490 
two-year-olds I don't think these two

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:32.670 
two-year-olds I don't think these two
year<00:04:30.669> old<00:04:30.760> should<00:04:30.910> be<00:04:31.090> racing<00:04:31.449> 12<00:04:31.720> or<00:04:31.930> 14<00:04:32.080> times

00:04:32.670 --> 00:04:32.680 
year old should be racing 12 or 14 times

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.400 
year old should be racing 12 or 14 times
you<00:04:33.370> know<00:04:33.490> but<00:04:34.090> it's<00:04:34.449> only<00:04:34.570> my<00:04:34.750> opinion<00:04:34.840> I

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:35.410 
you know but it's only my opinion I

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:37.740 
you know but it's only my opinion I
think<00:04:35.740> they<00:04:36.250> should<00:04:36.460> have<00:04:36.490> a<00:04:36.639> stake<00:04:37.300> series

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:37.750 
think they should have a stake series

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:39.719 
think they should have a stake series
for<00:04:37.990> four<00:04:38.229> and<00:04:38.350> five-year-olds<00:04:39.160> Ontario

00:04:39.719 --> 00:04:39.729 
for four and five-year-olds Ontario

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:41.400 
for four and five-year-olds Ontario
sired<00:04:40.090> when<00:04:40.449> they've<00:04:40.570> done<00:04:40.720> the<00:04:40.840> sire<00:04:41.050> stakes

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:41.410 
sired when they've done the sire stakes

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:43.610 
sired when they've done the sire stakes
he<00:04:41.650> could<00:04:41.770> have<00:04:41.889> another<00:04:42.130> program<00:04:42.669> for<00:04:42.940> them

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:43.620 
he could have another program for them

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:47.129 
he could have another program for them
what<00:04:44.620> about<00:04:44.710> just<00:04:44.979> adding<00:04:45.370> like<00:04:46.139> third

00:04:47.129 --> 00:04:47.139 
what about just adding like third

00:04:47.139 --> 00:04:50.189 
what about just adding like third
division<00:04:47.680> to<00:04:47.889> the<00:04:48.130> sire<00:04:48.940> stakes<00:04:49.240> program<00:04:49.750> like

00:04:50.189 --> 00:04:50.199 
division to the sire stakes program like

00:04:50.199 --> 00:04:51.779 
division to the sire stakes program like
the<00:04:50.320> ontario<00:04:50.710> science<00:04:50.860> tech<00:04:51.160> program<00:04:51.550> have<00:04:51.759> a

00:04:51.779 --> 00:04:51.789 
the ontario science tech program have a

00:04:51.789 --> 00:04:54.060 
the ontario science tech program have a
a<00:04:51.970> B<00:04:52.330> and<00:04:52.449> C<00:04:52.509> division<00:04:52.930> something<00:04:53.770> like<00:04:53.889> that

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:54.070 
a B and C division something like that

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:56.760 
a B and C division something like that
I'd<00:04:54.580> probably<00:04:54.639> aim<00:04:55.539> it<00:04:55.690> towards<00:04:56.139> older<00:04:56.380> horses

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:56.770 
I'd probably aim it towards older horses

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:59.879 
I'd probably aim it towards older horses
for<00:04:57.130> sure<00:04:57.250> four-year-olds<00:04:57.940> and<00:04:58.000> up<00:04:58.889> ontario

drivers<00:06:12.129> over<00:06:12.399> 200<00:06:12.819> pounds<00:06:12.939> only<00:06:13.449> then<00:06:13.689> I

00:06:13.709 --> 00:06:13.719 
drivers over 200 pounds only then I

00:06:13.719 --> 00:06:15.389 
drivers over 200 pounds only then I
might<00:06:13.929> have<00:06:14.050> a<00:06:14.110> shot<00:06:14.289> to<00:06:14.589> actually<00:06:15.129> drive<00:06:15.369> a

00:06:15.389 --> 00:06:15.399

horse at this track and be competitive

00:06:17.529 --> 00:06:19.649

00:06:22.859 --> 00:06:22.869 
here that would be eligible but I'd do

00:06:22.869 --> 00:06:31.629 
here that would be eligible but I'd do
something<00:06:23.110> like<00:06:23.199> that<00:06:23.289> for<00:06:23.439> sure
