00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:24.010
 the indispensable eyeliner for me can 

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:27.190
 having only the base can only have the 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:30.430
 intense mascara or smokey eyes 

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:34.560
 dark lips red lips do not matter 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:34.560
 there must always be aj liner 

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:40.380
 personally I prefer eyeliner in 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:43.050
 gel because they are very simple and have 

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:46.220
 also a nice semi-opaque rock effect 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:50.070
 how I like it and now I send a 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:52.950
 angled brush otherwise also a 

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:56.160
 brush of the pen ones are excellent 

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:59.930
 really that started so I prefer 

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:05.280
 starting from the sternum with small strokes 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:07.680
 and then virtually no one around and 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.229
 I always go more fine but because the part 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:13.880
 outside with the biggest gym anymore 

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:16.460
 intense support 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.649
 and then I combine all the points practically 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:25.460
 like the game of the week 

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:27.470
 pretty useless puzzles eyeliner 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:30.920
 for ages and for not really being one 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:33.710
 it has always been a must 

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:38.079
 topical there must be silence to be 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.079
 quiet because if they make a career mistake 

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:43.950
 an eyeliner of this title is perfect 

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:46.600
 for a quiet day look 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.780
 I personally love to stretch the line of 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:52.450
 eyeliner right at the temple almost 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:55.710
 just to make the look much more 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.710
 sexy and to finish 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:01.220
 one thing I like about detachment 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:04.960
 then indeed I believe it costs almost 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:08.570
 inalienable in general is that of 

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:10.610
 always go to color with liner also 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:13.220
 among the eyelashes then the rhyme 

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:16.160
 upper interior because it makes the look 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:20.000
 even more decisive and then it seems that 

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:22.220
 eyelashes are more now I put some 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.230
 black pencil inside the eye 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.180
 because I don't feel sorry for you without it 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:29.330
 to see me just have to make the 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:32.209
 the very aggressive eye then bends over 

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:36.920
 dinner a bang of mascara by volume 

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:40.480
 maximum and then we have a bulleted christ 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.480
 to make the look even more special 

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:48.780
 we can make it a little more interesting 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:54.930
 I take this liquid niner and I make a 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:57.420
 nice points I don't know who knows me knows it 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:59.580
 that I am not a conventional girl and 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:02.220
 so even today I had to add 

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:04.400
 a special test of the simple eye 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:04.400
 liner
