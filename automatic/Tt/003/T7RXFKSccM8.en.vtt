00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
mess hall today and this was after two

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.700 
mess hall today and this was after two
massive<00:01:35.820> meals<00:01:36.090> over<00:01:36.299> the<00:01:36.450> course<00:01:36.630> of<00:01:36.810> five

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
massive meals over the course of five

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.440 
massive meals over the course of five
hours<00:01:37.920> and<00:01:38.250> I<00:01:38.280> could<00:01:38.430> have<00:01:38.520> stolen<00:01:38.759> two<00:01:38.939> cases

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:39.450 
hours and I could have stolen two cases

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.179 
hours and I could have stolen two cases
of<00:01:39.479> this<00:01:39.720> stuff<00:01:39.960> and<00:01:40.110> nobody<00:01:40.409> ever<00:01:40.829> would<00:01:41.100> have

00:01:41.179 --> 00:01:41.189 
of this stuff and nobody ever would have

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.039
