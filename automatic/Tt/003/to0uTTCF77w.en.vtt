commenting and to somewhat of a future
and<00:00:47.160> maybe<00:00:47.610> like<00:00:47.820> a<00:00:47.850> YouTube<00:00:48.420> would<00:00:48.750> be<00:00:48.899> the

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
and maybe like a YouTube would be the

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.630 
and maybe like a YouTube would be the
beginning<00:00:49.469> of<00:00:49.710> it<00:00:49.920> we'll<00:00:50.160> see<00:00:50.340> that's<00:00:50.489> just

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
beginning of it we'll see that's just

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:52.729 
beginning of it we'll see that's just
further<00:00:50.969> down<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.329> road<00:00:51.480> but<00:00:52.020> anyways<00:00:52.379> I<00:00:52.530> will

00:00:52.729 --> 00:00:52.739 
further down the road but anyways I will

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:54.200 
further down the road but anyways I will
start<00:00:53.010> uploading<00:00:53.370> I<00:00:53.489> was<00:00:53.699> getting<00:00:53.940> a<00:00:54.030> lot<00:00:54.180> of

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:54.210 
start uploading I was getting a lot of

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.970 
start uploading I was getting a lot of
messages<00:00:54.600> start<00:00:54.960> opening<00:00:55.230> more<00:00:55.440> consistently

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980 
messages start opening more consistently

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.130 
messages start opening more consistently
and<00:00:56.280> to<00:00:56.730> start<00:00:57.149> the<00:00:57.239> new<00:00:57.360> clown<00:00:57.600> back<00:00:57.780> up<00:00:57.930> again

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:58.140 
and to start the new clown back up again

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.020 
and to start the new clown back up again
so<00:00:58.289> that<00:00:58.320> is<00:00:58.530> what<00:00:58.770> I<00:00:58.920> will<00:00:58.949> do<00:00:59.309> I<00:00:59.520> guess<00:00:59.910> since

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
so that is what I will do I guess since

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.610 
so that is what I will do I guess since
monitor<00:01:00.359> 43<00:01:00.660> is<00:01:00.780> just<00:01:00.960> around<00:01:01.140> the<00:01:01.260> corner

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
monitor 43 is just around the corner

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.080 
monitor 43 is just around the corner
that's<00:01:01.800> why<00:01:01.920> everyone<00:01:02.190> was<00:01:02.280> asking<00:01:02.489> or<00:01:02.910> just

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
that's why everyone was asking or just

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:04.759 
that's why everyone was asking or just
because<00:01:03.239> they<00:01:03.359> really<00:01:03.600> like<00:01:03.840> the<00:01:03.989> series<00:01:04.320> so

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
because they really like the series so

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.410 
because they really like the series so
if<00:01:04.890> you<00:01:04.979> do<00:01:05.100> not<00:01:05.280> know<00:01:05.460> the<00:01:05.489> series<00:01:05.939> is<00:01:06.090> it's<00:01:06.270> me

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420
