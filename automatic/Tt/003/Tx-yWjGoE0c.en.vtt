00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:07.860
 Do not say much more and bring in a Grammy 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:13.629
 Every year, the time has come again and here on the consoles in the last race 

00:00:13.629 --> 00:00:15.150
 Year reminds the jam 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.769
 Rollig good trip made in the modern 

00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:21.210
 Treyarch is now pushing the series back to World War II 

00:00:22.089 --> 00:00:25.519
 The bad development team that made Call of Duty 3 did not do that well for them 

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:25.919
 you 

00:00:25.919 --> 00:00:28.919
 they can not do that ode 

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.170
 and as you can see, in Kohler 2, they have taken the many examples 

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.140
 staging the whole story far from Ernst, of course, himself 

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.720
 and also total is also relatively well cut it is for example one 

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.760
 Vanessa game mode where you have to defend yourself against zombies 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:54.010
 and blue as you suddenly see the very happy it pops 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.670
 It is super staged role of factum 

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:01.680
 beautiful threw Serbs should be through the scenario of the Pacific War, there are times 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.680
 something new 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:08.640
 but you can throw the player in front of this is nothing more than a brightly colored 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.880
 beautiful shooting gallery is 

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:13.880
 so grabbed game "Far Cry 2" I will not recommend 

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.100
 but on the other hand, the mission is all really well done 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:28.370
 it is so that there is always something around you 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:32.940
 Meeting is you have more time for coal for the 3 

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:37.240
 it gets really annoying so a cast the artwork is up 

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.450
 absolutely satisfactory completely clean there are only minimal applicable 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:42.160
 related 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.050
 sometimes there are head slightly torn to the knees 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:48.070
 Technically correct game down possible funky Schouten 

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:04.840
 and of course 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.710
 Percent the hall to play the grandiose opening balance sheets of the 

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:11.710
 different 

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:35.459
 that's not new 

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:38.430
 the EHF in the wheel is not new to this game that's actually pretty much 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.969
 around 

00:02:40.969 --> 00:02:45.040
 not stale at whose seven victories goes put on a very safe prz 

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:47.519
 hard for this plays what he can 

00:02:47.519 --> 00:02:50.169
 and what the culture they were living 

00:02:50.169 --> 00:02:52.239
 best possible quality 

00:02:52.239 --> 00:02:55.390
 Samsung brave as Call of Duty 4 and it may be playful now, too 

00:02:55.389 --> 00:02:56.809
 not so 

00:02:56.809 --> 00:02:59.809
 if he damn set up for mischief 

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:04.629
 would have to clock appear that is all argued with us but in the end 

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:07.239
 it is not really great percent 

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:09.149
 after a nice trip 

00:03:09.149 --> 00:03:11.779
 in fact it is open 

00:03:11.779 --> 00:03:16.259
 UNAMID game mode really promises a lot of fun Mirco Polus Bottrop OK 

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:37.319
 The Appearance Absolutely Left Favorite Game East Game CRM 

00:03:38.449 --> 00:03:40.709

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:46.409

00:04:09.039 --> 00:04:12.039
 Why 

00:04:13.169 --> 00:04:16.169
 Euro 

00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:00.819
 to know the reins in the 20 biggest 

00:05:00.819 --> 00:05:03.400
 an absolutely cool pig 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:04.879
