00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.570
 so hello and welcome to 

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.279
 my video review of 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:07.589
 mr avi divx that comes in this 

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.780
 big wooden box therefore the man 

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.250
 you can open all stones here 

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.740
 can deposit the rest 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.059
 game material and the game itself stands 

00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.619
 now not more than I can yes 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.779
 also do not give a complete regular 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:20.460
 So want to know plays like armani 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:22.230
 the looks my opinion and review video to 

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:24.449
 hanna as in playing cards I have it 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.289
 that explains in a relatively comprehensive way 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:27.840
 now not everything again 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.519
 repeat and then say if this 

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.080
 Steiner covers all the middle of the table 

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:33.719
 down and now is again 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.510
 every player hides five stones 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:40.050
 pull and the stones then see from 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:42.390
 front just so that that would be 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:45.149
 now the green 5 that the blue four 

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:48.120
 that the green once the white three the 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:50.370
 yellow 4 is relatively self-explanatory and 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.300
 as you may see they are there 

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.309
 recessed 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:55.260
 they are not over painted or anything like that 

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.190
 means if you take such a stone that 

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.170
 you should make sure that you do not 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.760
 you can somehow attack the front 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.059
 Feel what that is, so I could do it now 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:04.769
 say that a 2 is it's a 2 um 

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:06.570
 a little exercise, you know which one 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.070
 symbol that's the one you get out too 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.030
 you should really be there 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.619
 but the player himself 

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.770
 so shit through the stone easy 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.549
 Do not look at it and put it down 

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:16.530
 that you can not rest 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.820
 Of course it would be nice if you were there 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.799
 in the back another layer of varnish or 

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.420
 one would that made it over the 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.830
 simply not provided 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:24.409
 can fulfill because it just stops 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.720
 Annoying if you look at yourself somehow 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:29.220
 decision 

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:31.380
 the notice brokers are here now too 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.150
 sometimes also from something higher quality 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.009
 material printed on one side 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:38.040
 from the other side and not the 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.210
 thunderstorm marca look like this from the left 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:43.229
 start like that and they will too 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:45.750
 always turned around and their 

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:48.630
 principle still the same so still 

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.250
 At the beginning of the game, you subtly draw yours 

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.079
 stones stands the forwards 

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.079
 two people plays my fellow players 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:57.780
 would do that now and then 

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:59.880
 you could just say that again 

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:01.950
 hints and what, of course 

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:04.320
 now you had to be very nice 

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:05.610
 always somehow get stuck and hold 

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.590
 no idea and if I am now 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.509
 somehow knows that both 1 

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:11.920
 archive munich, however, and says here 

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:13.840
 these are the two individually which as 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.540
 Next, learn that the and the green ones 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.519
 Of course I can somehow be like that 

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:21.310
 stand together and know okay over here 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:22.660
 nothing with them nor the respective 1 1 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.040
 that 's the two that I can do that 

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:25.299
 somehow a little bit better 

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:29.080
 the table arrangement by me 

00:02:25.299 --> 00:02:30.370
 somehow build better eselsbrÃ¼cken and 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.049
 It is also very practical that you 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.910
 really also after that stones off and 

00:02:32.049 --> 00:02:36.760
 Of course they are also somehow 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:39.250
 open on the stacks stack one man 

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:40.480
 just build somewhere here you can 

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.340
 which of course always easy 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:44.560
 assign color very well that 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:46.390
 you always right back the stones 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.620
 are already out that means there we have to 

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.720
 take special care now 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:51.150
 So just create more and more 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:54.099
 even better survey that it already 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:56.500
 It can be quite good depending on the light ratio 

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:58.540
 its not that the blue is really 

00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:00.129
 can see well if there somehow 

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:01.239
 look and so the most already after the 

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:03.040
 50 garden blue 

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:04.810
 So you should make sure that you 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:06.700
 has enough light that I had the 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:11.260
 personally no problems with it 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:12.549
 in a dark environment and at 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:13.600
 People who are there with their problem 

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:15.269
 that can be a bit 

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:18.880
 become difficult 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:20.380
 and yes that's the kind of game material 

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.459
 her is very good 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:23.230
 High quality to that is in any case 

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:25.180
 very well done with me also has no 

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:27.069
 What a bit of a miracle 

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:29.109
 when the game is after us 

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:32.920
 has played in this box 

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:34.450
 Stowed and I also have the colorful 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.849
 stones so there are for loot was 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:40.299
 Something for the claus I have now 

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:42.340
 all the hair is third in number 

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:46.959
 I would always out looking for me 

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:50.109
 can of course try that now 

00:03:46.959 --> 00:03:53.849
 Stones everything nice and clean 

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:58.959
 to sort out anything is too chic 

00:03:53.849 --> 00:04:00.579
 and looks reasonably good and so on 

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:01.690
 I said you can find all the 

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:05.160
 arrange 

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:06.700
 The only problem is that I do that 

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:09.760
 fast passage is not much 

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:11.500
 only once the problem fought the proxy 

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:12.100
 so demonstrate it in advance 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:15.520
 to take 

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:17.650
 who just live much better this box 

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:18.970
 would have become a little smaller then 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:19.480
 Of course, they are no longer the whole topic 

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:22.650
 do 

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:24.850
 but it would simply everything a 

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:28.650
 more beautiful as you can see 

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:28.650
 practically everything is very good 

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:40.060
 Normally you can do it easily 

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:43.390
 Throw in and then the others 

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:48.090
 I would definitely stones that 

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:51.670
 to whiten those in this building 

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:53.230
 and then everything is placed in it 

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:55.150
 as you can see now you have here 

00:04:53.230 --> 00:05:01.180
 just the air in it so not that 

00:04:55.150 --> 00:05:02.920
 there was a I do that everything would 

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:04.720
 have been nice if you still ours 

00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:06.520
 foam insert the choice on it 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:08.380
 could have done that the stones just 

00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:10.060
 Do not torture so wildly in the area 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:12.910
 if you transport the field mp 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:14.500
 in your pocket then suitcases or so much 

00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:15.760
 afraid that there will come in a few quirks 

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:17.800
 that would be nicer if that somehow 

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:19.240
 It would be different, that was just that 

00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:21.670
 box maybe a bit none 

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:23.320
 So I think so 60 percent and 

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:27.040
 half of it for us on perfect 

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:29.080
 do as I said so his insert the 

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:30.640
 one nevertheless so stock from the state me there 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:31.540
 this really is everything 

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:33.850
 his place remains 

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:35.440
 if you have a second edition 

00:05:33.850 --> 00:05:37.060
 made that I did not have to shape 

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:38.910
 that's meant to be irritated since then 

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:41.020
 miracles are beautiful but games 

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:42.760
 Somehow there could be something to it 

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:45.010
 otherwise that's really one 

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:47.230
 very high quality version that's the stop 

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:48.670
 a lot of pimping on it 

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:50.050
 much we have what was real indeed 

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:53.020
 not this from the computer but to the 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:54.310
 played that is very much to the stone 

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:56.680
 just makes a lot of stuff 

00:05:54.310 --> 00:06:00.610
 me personally much more fun that too 

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:01.870
 Playing as a pure card game is like that 

00:06:00.610 --> 00:06:03.550
 two three things to improve 

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:04.570
 Can you also say a lax about it 

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:05.410
 that you really can not do things 

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:07.969
 can fulfill 

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:09.889
 the blue maybe a bit 

00:06:07.969 --> 00:06:12.110
 not otherwise will make even brighter 

00:06:09.889 --> 00:06:14.709
 so just a little better 

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:16.639
 Contrast and as I said this box 

00:06:14.709 --> 00:06:19.159
 because then you can prevent it 

00:06:16.639 --> 00:06:20.689
 I have not got any problems yet 

00:06:19.159 --> 00:06:22.219
 discovered but it would be very very 

00:06:20.689 --> 00:06:23.539
 annoying if you have any kind of 

00:06:22.219 --> 00:06:25.519
 macken pure you always immediately 

00:06:23.539 --> 00:06:30.619
 the one with the mark she stretched yellow 

00:06:25.519 --> 00:06:32.599
 2 who would believe me but just 

00:06:30.619 --> 00:06:33.709
 otherwise a navi is a great game 

00:06:32.599 --> 00:06:34.369
 this year is game of the year 

00:06:33.709 --> 00:06:35.749
 become 

00:06:34.369 --> 00:06:38.989
 maybe that's just why it is 

00:06:35.749 --> 00:06:40.489
 the sitting position and the hanna like marc 

00:06:38.989 --> 00:06:42.739
 and loves to play and also easy 

00:06:40.489 --> 00:06:44.139
 like to play games in beach beauty 

00:06:42.739 --> 00:06:47.259
 they have to do something 

00:06:44.139 --> 00:06:49.969
 I can only recommend that very much 

00:06:47.259 --> 00:06:51.919
 Nice play day is on the banderoles 

00:06:49.969 --> 00:06:53.689
 why is she such a blue one? 

00:06:51.919 --> 00:06:55.009
 sea is this that I have the same 

00:06:53.689 --> 00:06:59.509
 disposed of and taken away 

00:06:55.009 --> 00:07:01.039
 Just fallen down that is one 

00:06:59.509 --> 00:07:03.049
 a little stupid but if it is on the shelf 

00:07:01.039 --> 00:07:04.610
 that's pretty chic that is 

00:07:03.049 --> 00:07:06.379
 Alright , it works for everyone 

00:07:04.610 --> 00:07:09.860
 case fun in this version too 

00:07:06.379 --> 00:07:11.419
 play and like all diana like 

00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:13.399
 but if you know like players again 

00:07:11.419 --> 00:07:14.569
 somehow like and find great 

00:07:13.399 --> 00:07:16.279
 and if you are good for that too 

00:07:14.569 --> 00:07:17.449
 christmas investigated since then 

00:07:16.279 --> 00:07:20.779
 but grew definitely a very 

00:07:17.449 --> 00:07:22.369
 cool idea and therefore I hope that 

00:07:20.779 --> 00:07:24.559
 it even deeper now was helpful 

00:07:22.369 --> 00:07:26.089
 that they know everything he knows 

00:07:24.559 --> 00:07:30.110
 should you still ask are easy 

00:07:26.089 --> 00:07:31.550
 like to ask and then turn to you 

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:34.059
 I wish you all very much 

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:34.059
 have fun with it
