introduced in this latest batch now it's

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:52.710 
introduced in this latest batch now it's
not<00:00:51.100> the<00:00:51.310> fastest<00:00:51.790> of<00:00:51.820> the<00:00:51.970> things<00:00:52.270> out<00:00:52.510> there

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:52.720 
not the fastest of the things out there

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:54.000 
not the fastest of the things out there
is<00:00:52.990> pretty<00:00:53.380> fast

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:54.010 
is pretty fast

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.100 
is pretty fast
for<00:00:54.670> what<00:00:54.880> it<00:00:55.000> is<00:00:55.030> I<00:00:55.180> mean<00:00:55.360> it<00:00:55.570> starts<00:00:55.930> off

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:56.110 
for what it is I mean it starts off

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:59.280 
for what it is I mean it starts off
about<00:00:57.000> 200-250<00:00:58.000> percent<00:00:58.510> speed<00:00:58.780> or<00:00:59.020> something

00:00:59.280 --> 00:00:59.290 
about 200-250 percent speed or something

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:01.500 
about 200-250 percent speed or something
like<00:00:59.380> that<00:00:59.440> because<00:00:59.680> he<00:00:59.980> is<00:01:00.100> fairly<00:01:00.430> slow<00:01:00.760> so

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:01.510 
like that because he is fairly slow so

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.799 
like that because he is fairly slow so
once<00:01:01.780> we<00:01:02.020> set<00:01:02.350> in<00:01:02.560> to<00:01:02.740> enable<00:01:03.220> wandering<00:01:03.809> and

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:56.480 
two of these just shooting the out

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:59.439 
two of these just shooting the out
of<00:03:56.510> it<00:03:56.750> and<00:03:57.530> boom<00:03:57.919> he's<00:03:58.400> dead<00:03:58.669> that's<00:03:59.180> in

00:03:59.439 --> 00:03:59.449 
of it and boom he's dead that's in

00:03:59.449 --> 00:04:01.240 
of it and boom he's dead that's in
there's<00:03:59.690> another<00:03:59.750> one<00:04:00.079> over<00:04:00.109> there<00:04:00.349> there's

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:01.250 
there's another one over there there's

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:03.580 
there's another one over there there's
getting<00:04:01.459> hit<00:04:01.760> and<00:04:02.000> that's<00:04:02.150> dead<00:04:02.510> too<00:04:02.840> I<00:04:03.079> mean<00:04:03.500> I

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:03.590 
getting hit and that's dead too I mean I

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:05.860 
getting hit and that's dead too I mean I
don't<00:04:03.650> know<00:04:03.949> how<00:04:04.190> rare<00:04:04.639> the<00:04:05.060> seed<00:04:05.359> for<00:04:05.720> these

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:05.870 
don't know how rare the seed for these

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:08.589 
don't know how rare the seed for these
plants<00:04:06.739> is<00:04:06.980> but<00:04:07.370> I<00:04:07.400> suspect<00:04:07.760> that's<00:04:08.239> gonna<00:04:08.419> be

00:04:08.589 --> 00:04:08.599 
plants is but I suspect that's gonna be

00:04:08.599 --> 00:04:10.330 
plants is but I suspect that's gonna be
addressed<00:04:08.989> a<00:04:09.139> little<00:04:09.260> bit<00:04:09.500> later<00:04:09.769> on<00:04:09.919> because

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:10.340 
addressed a little bit later on because

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:11.860 
addressed a little bit later on because
that<00:04:10.459> doesn't<00:04:10.760> actually<00:04:10.849> require<00:04:11.209> any<00:04:11.599> ammo

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:11.870 
that doesn't actually require any ammo

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:14.110 
that doesn't actually require any ammo
so<00:04:12.739> that's<00:04:13.040> gonna<00:04:13.160> be<00:04:13.250> interesting<00:04:13.819> to<00:04:13.970> see

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:14.120 
so that's gonna be interesting to see

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:15.759 
so that's gonna be interesting to see
how<00:04:14.329> they're<00:04:14.510> actually<00:04:14.840> gonna<00:04:14.989> address<00:04:15.440> that

00:04:15.759 --> 00:04:15.769 
how they're actually gonna address that

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:17.500 
how they're actually gonna address that
if<00:04:16.130> you<00:04:16.310> haven't<00:04:16.579> picked<00:04:16.729> up<00:04:16.880> Ark<00:04:17.150> survival
