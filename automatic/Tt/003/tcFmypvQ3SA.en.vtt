00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
think it's the best way to describe it

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.570 
think it's the best way to describe it
and<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:18.930> cool<00:01:19.110> thing<00:01:19.140> is<00:01:19.320> you<00:01:19.650> turn<00:01:20.040> it<00:01:20.159> on<00:01:20.250> and

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580 
and the cool thing is you turn it on and

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.730 
and the cool thing is you turn it on and
it<00:01:21.150> like<00:01:21.299> vibrates<00:01:21.750> and<00:01:21.960> in<00:01:22.020> the<00:01:22.110> middle<00:01:22.320> if

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:22.740 
it like vibrates and in the middle if

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.020 
it like vibrates and in the middle if
you<00:01:22.799> can<00:01:22.950> see<00:01:23.220> it<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.400> middle<00:01:23.610> brush<00:01:23.850> like

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
you can see it the middle brush like

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.620 
you can see it the middle brush like
spins<00:01:24.450> and<00:01:25.520> there's<00:01:26.520> a<00:01:26.580> timer<00:01:26.939> in<00:01:27.270> it<00:01:27.390> so<00:01:27.600> you

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
spins and there's a timer in it so you

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:28.819
