00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.969 
that would just be too much of a
coincidence<00:01:01.100> but<00:01:01.939> I<00:01:02.119> did<00:01:02.659> end<00:01:02.869> up<00:01:03.049> contacting

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:03.979

Kodak<00:02:29.069> Alaris<00:02:29.280> was<00:02:29.579> able<00:02:29.909> to<00:02:30.030> do<00:02:30.209> that<00:02:30.390> with

00:02:30.619 --> 00:02:30.629 
Kodak Alaris was able to do that with

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:32.420 
Kodak Alaris was able to do that with
their<00:02:30.810> technology<00:02:31.470> and<00:02:31.709> one<00:02:32.010> of<00:02:32.129> our<00:02:32.220> goals

their technology and one of our goals

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.789 
their technology and one of our goals
was<00:02:32.730> to<00:02:32.760> make<00:02:33.000> this<00:02:33.150> website<00:02:33.390> searchable<00:02:34.170> so

00:02:34.789 --> 00:02:34.799 
was to make this website searchable so

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:36.350 
was to make this website searchable so
to<00:02:34.890> be<00:02:35.040> able<00:02:35.069> to<00:02:35.280> capture<00:02:35.579> that<00:02:35.760> caption

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:36.360 
to be able to capture that caption

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.619 
to be able to capture that caption
information<00:02:36.870> as<00:02:37.019> well<00:02:37.549> through<00:02:38.549> use<00:02:39.209> of<00:02:39.239> their

00:02:39.619 --> 00:02:39.629 
information as well through use of their

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:41.330 
information as well through use of their
optical<00:02:40.079> character<00:02:40.470> recognition<00:02:40.500> software

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
optical character recognition software

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.750 
optical character recognition software
was<00:02:42.269> a<00:02:42.299> big<00:02:42.510> plus<00:02:42.750> to<00:02:42.780> I<00:02:43.230> knew<00:02:43.709> that<00:02:43.760> they

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
was a big plus to I knew that they

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.759 
was a big plus to I knew that they
needed<00:02:44.910> to<00:02:45.090> be<00:02:45.180> handled<00:02:45.450> with<00:02:45.840> care<00:02:46.140> and<00:02:46.200> so

00:02:46.759 --> 00:02:46.769 
needed to be handled with care and so

00:02:46.769 --> 00:02:49.220 
needed to be handled with care and so
when<00:02:46.980> we<00:02:47.010> took<00:02:47.310> them<00:02:47.549> to<00:02:48.090> Kodak<00:02:48.480> Alaris<00:02:48.750> and

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:49.230 
when we took them to Kodak Alaris and

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:52.069 
when we took them to Kodak Alaris and
put<00:02:49.680> them<00:02:49.829> through<00:02:50.010> the<00:02:50.099> scanner<00:02:51.019> they<00:02:52.019> were

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:52.079 
put them through the scanner they were

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:54.199 
put them through the scanner they were
scanned<00:02:52.590> in<00:02:52.829> a<00:02:52.920> matter<00:02:53.099> of<00:02:53.190> seconds<00:02:53.730> we<00:02:54.090> don't

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.209 
scanned in a matter of seconds we don't

00:02:54.209 --> 00:02:55.849 
scanned in a matter of seconds we don't
have<00:02:54.390> to<00:02:54.569> slow<00:02:54.750> down<00:02:54.989> just<00:02:55.290> because<00:02:55.470> you're

00:02:55.849 --> 00:02:55.859 
have to slow down just because you're

00:02:55.859 --> 00:02:58.339 
have to slow down just because you're
scanning<00:02:56.190> both<00:02:56.489> sides<00:02:56.819> at<00:02:57.060> the<00:02:57.180> same<00:02:57.239> time<00:02:57.690> we

00:02:58.339 --> 00:02:58.349 
scanning both sides at the same time we

00:02:58.349 --> 00:03:01.250 
scanning both sides at the same time we
keep<00:02:59.010> the<00:02:59.220> scanner<00:02:59.549> at<00:02:59.790> the<00:02:59.970> full<00:03:00.390> rated<00:03:00.989> speed

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260 
keep the scanner at the full rated speed

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.770 
keep the scanner at the full rated speed
when<00:03:01.829> doing<00:03:02.340> either<00:03:02.549> single<00:03:03.060> sided<00:03:03.269> or<00:03:03.540> both

sides at the same time partnering with
Kodak<00:03:06.329> Alaris<00:03:06.569> allowed<00:03:07.140> us<00:03:07.260> to<00:03:07.290> move<00:03:07.560> the

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739 
Kodak Alaris allowed us to move the

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:09.619 
Kodak Alaris allowed us to move the
timeline<00:03:08.190> on<00:03:08.340> this<00:03:08.370> project<00:03:08.700> along<00:03:09.180> very

00:03:09.619 --> 00:03:09.629 
timeline on this project along very

00:03:09.629 --> 00:03:12.380 
timeline on this project along very
quickly<00:03:09.950> if<00:03:10.950> we<00:03:11.040> had<00:03:11.310> had<00:03:11.340> to<00:03:11.609> scan<00:03:11.909> each<00:03:12.180> of

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
quickly if we had had to scan each of

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:14.449 
quickly if we had had to scan each of
these<00:03:12.480> photos<00:03:12.840> individually<00:03:13.500> and<00:03:13.680> what<00:03:14.310> we're

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
these photos individually and what we're

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:16.190 
these photos individually and what we're
used<00:03:14.609> to<00:03:14.700> using<00:03:14.879> as<00:03:15.090> a<00:03:15.120> flatbed<00:03:15.569> scanner<00:03:15.870> it

used to using as a flatbed scanner it

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.740 
used to using as a flatbed scanner it
would<00:03:16.349> have<00:03:16.440> taken<00:03:16.560> a<00:03:16.769> very<00:03:17.069> long<00:03:17.519> time<00:03:17.910> I'm

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750 
would have taken a very long time I'm

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.120 
would have taken a very long time I'm
not<00:03:19.019> even<00:03:19.230> sure<00:03:19.260> if<00:03:19.590> we<00:03:19.680> would<00:03:19.799> have<00:03:19.919> been<00:03:20.010> able

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:20.130 
not even sure if we would have been able

00:03:20.130 --> 00:03:21.979 
not even sure if we would have been able
to<00:03:20.280> commit<00:03:20.730> that<00:03:20.940> kind<00:03:21.120> of<00:03:21.269> time<00:03:21.540> to<00:03:21.840> this

00:03:21.979 --> 00:03:21.989 
to commit that kind of time to this

to commit that kind of time to this
project<00:03:22.230> to<00:03:22.530> be<00:03:22.620> able<00:03:22.680> to<00:03:22.859> scan<00:03:23.040> them

project to be able to scan them

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:26.089 
project to be able to scan them
individually<00:03:23.459> I'm<00:03:24.209> most<00:03:24.510> excited<00:03:24.720> to<00:03:25.410> know

00:03:26.089 --> 00:03:26.099 
individually I'm most excited to know

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:28.190 
individually I'm most excited to know
that<00:03:26.130> these<00:03:26.849> photos<00:03:27.299> are<00:03:27.450> out<00:03:27.630> there<00:03:27.840> for<00:03:28.079> the

could have the same experience that I

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:35.270 
could have the same experience that I
had<00:03:33.450> and<00:03:33.720> possibly<00:03:34.260> learn<00:03:34.560> more<00:03:34.859> about<00:03:34.980> their
