00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 hello hello I'm back arcade and 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:07.730
 namely to come at anniversary edition 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.730
 my tenth update video much fun 

00:00:10.759 --> 00:00:14.549
 today the order is different now 

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.230
 I'll start with the first topic 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:17.520
 I take my look movie yes I have 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.350
 my view movie uploaded 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.430
 most of you will be him already 

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.230
 Certainly have seen and if I have 

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:23.789
 Look at him on the movie is on 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.439
 every case a crowd puller in the 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.000
 screen already has it though 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:28.920
 only a week is already uploaded 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.650
 over 1000 video calls because I am pleased 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.270
 Me really, so I really think 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.010
 class, I am really really very much 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.559
 All the effort was worth it 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.050
 and not only because of that, but because of him 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:43.260
 really very many likes 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.820
 Although has a dislike but the 

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.320
 most of these definitely 

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.450
 I can see that there I have a lot 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.550
 clearly and I'm really very 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.190
 really really over yours 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.170
 Positive feedback pleased because it came 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.730
 so many positive comments sometimes 

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.989
 also really almost novels really 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.940
 I have longer comments 

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.500
 really very happy and that has me 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:03.510
 really fun all the way 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.220
 to answer comments so though 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.900
 which has now taken half an hour 

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.619
 on the first day the alley comments too 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.240
 answer 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:11.040
 from this genius what you all there 

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.869
 wrote and how much you 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.369
 I was pleased that it was real 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.229
 really got very close with that 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.790
 trickfilm on the last day the last 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:19.860
 hours I have really many scenes 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.119
 done together and like most of 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:22.830
 you have noticed that the story for 

00:01:21.119 --> 00:01:25.470
 Part of a comic is because I'm there 

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.549
 had pretty much the same idea and is there 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:28.110
 I noticed that, there are already 

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:29.430
 actually a comic and that's why 

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.140
 I then took part 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.299
 but such details I will apply to everyone 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:34.259
 case still in the next video talk 

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.540
 I will become a special one 

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.250
 trickfilm update or such an info video 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.979
 where I will give you more information 

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.840
 will give and it will definitely be 

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:44.909
 I still follow many videos during that 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.770
 the recording of my movie made that way 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:49.049
 have such kind behind the 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:50.939
 scenes videos behind the scenes 

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:52.500
 videos but in the next days will 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.720
 I first try the info video too 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.250
 to make a film look then we come 

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.689
 to the next topic it is indeed a 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.100
 a little bit longer since the follow 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.290
 aired 

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:03.689
 but yes season 6 yes I am 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.960
 really pleased with the consequences 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:09.209
 was really very well done and 

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.800
 yes some have complained that 

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.480
 somehow do not drive well or have 

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.260
 I do not like to honestly say it 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.909
 were from the whole 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.329
 stagger the most exciting consequences 

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:20.310
 not at all really sat there and 

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:22.019
 there was really focused on the 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:23.879
 screen looked so I was there really 

00:02:22.019 --> 00:02:25.189
 really caught in and I found 

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:27.209
 They are really very exciting 

00:02:25.189 --> 00:02:29.489
 So there was hardly any tension 

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:32.870
 so they are very good 

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:34.769
 had follow were really really nice 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.239
 I do not know how I handle that 

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:39.000
 so they were really real 

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:40.560
 Pure relaxation so I really found all 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.989
 the following were very well done so it 

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:45.299
 started with the consequences with if so 

00:02:42.989 --> 00:02:46.379
 they were the most exciting ever 

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:48.260
 I saw the goods here really 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:50.430
 really well done and really very 

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:53.459
 seriously and then at the end unfortunately 

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:55.920
 sad and just like the others 

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:58.290
 follow with senator clovis and next to it 

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.150
 embo and then in the end knows where the there 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.889
 on the planet where the then on scipio 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:03.450
 I think that was with the whole 

00:03:01.889 --> 00:03:05.760
 must plan with the banks and so on 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:07.859
 really really well done and 

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:10.500
 that's exactly how the others were 

00:03:07.859 --> 00:03:11.730
 follow where then just with georgia 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:13.019
 bings so I did not think so now 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.340
 Bad so I'm not that one now 

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:16.590
 shoppingcenter me that is actually 

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:18.780
 relatively unimportant so that belongs just to 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.250
 how the whole thing pretty bleak 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.680
 I really liked it a lot 

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:24.959
 later that night nurse 

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:27.150
 The leader has come to share 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:29.579
 and yes I think that's common 

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:31.849
 So well done, that's your voice 

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:33.959
 all that she says again as an echo 

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:35.730
 is repeated but with a lot 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:37.829
 lower men's voice so that's what I think 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:39.120
 Really well done that sounds almost real 

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:40.530
 already scary when they start to 

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.870
 speak really really well done 

00:03:40.530 --> 00:03:45.419
 and the consequences were really great 

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:46.829
 exciting with yes and of course the 

00:03:45.419 --> 00:03:49.410
 the most important consequence of all, namely the 

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:52.230
 with jutta I really found it 

00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:54.419
 very great with all these scenes 

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:57.269
 cowardly and all these premonitions the 

00:03:54.419 --> 00:03:58.169
 he had there and also the whole scenes 

00:03:57.269 --> 00:03:59.519
 where, for example, may be with them 

00:03:58.169 --> 00:04:01.549
 it has come off we really have 

00:03:59.519 --> 00:04:03.750
 many details and details 

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:04.319
 thought and that also brought in 

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.699
 the consequences 

00:04:04.319 --> 00:04:06.989
 I was very surprised but im 

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:07.620
 positive senses have me really good 

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:09.900
 like 

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.609
 and of course that, for example, yoga like that 

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.739
 a starfighter has like anakin and obi 

00:04:11.609 --> 00:04:15.419
 wan merely that he just smaller in the 

00:04:13.739 --> 00:04:17.609
 version is adapted ebner for user 

00:04:15.419 --> 00:04:19.049
 I think it's really cool and there was also 

00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:20.699
 really scene where i actually almost 

00:04:19.049 --> 00:04:22.409
 I started to cry now 

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:25.200
 not with grief but with joy because 

00:04:22.409 --> 00:04:28.710
 that was the scene where it was one though 

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:30.780
 illusion So where or then at once 

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:32.039
 Jedi temple stood and all were each 

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:33.750
 around him and we just have 

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:35.940
 talked and there the paravan said 

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:38.099
 There is only peace and quiet here 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:42.870
 I really liked the scene a lot 

00:04:38.099 --> 00:04:45.000
 good and that is actually that again 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:46.080
 what each year they fight for 

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.210
 actually contradictory is namely 

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:50.010
 for peace and that's why I found 

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:52.710
 the scene really really hama where 

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:53.729
 just as easy or there was and 

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:55.469
 All ladys are easy 

00:04:53.729 --> 00:04:56.909
 talked to each other and there were and 

00:04:55.469 --> 00:04:58.590
 just like you just peace 

00:04:56.909 --> 00:05:00.300
 these are actually the principles of 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:01.740
 Jedi but she has already forgotten 

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:03.210
 because the war has been around him for so long 

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:05.669
 prevails and therefore only because itself 

00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:07.650
 a bit suspicious and yes so 

00:05:05.669 --> 00:05:10.020
 I think it is a pity that is an illusion 

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:11.400
 unfortunately only was but i really found it 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:13.080
 very nice that they installed something like that 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:15.120
 I really liked it very much 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:18.000
 and several people have asked me if 

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:19.529
 I will have to come to a dvd 

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:21.240
 I do not know anything yet 

00:05:19.529 --> 00:05:24.690
 I think nothing was known there 

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:27.180
 given but I think that the 

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:28.770
 Of course, dvd starcom should be mine 

00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:30.960
 no good reason now why 

00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:32.940
 it should give no dvd he 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:34.650
 if necessary, which problems 

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:36.330
 but I should give with the licenses 

00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:38.010
 think that a dvd will come 

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:39.479
 let's come to the last topic, namely 

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:41.550
 that's my collection 

00:05:39.479 --> 00:05:44.070
 yes i was in march at the beginning of the month 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:45.840
 berlin in lego star and have one there 

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:48.539
 few things bought around a collection 

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:50.279
 expand and one was the lego 

00:05:48.539 --> 00:05:53.010
 mug I bought there and 

00:05:50.279 --> 00:05:54.750
 I found really good that I have really 

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:56.789
 have built together very well that many 

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:59.250
 parts already used for my letter film 

00:05:56.789 --> 00:06:01.010
 and for more mox so I think it's real 

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:03.570
 was really worth buying 

00:06:01.010 --> 00:06:05.130
 really very useful the parts that 

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:07.110
 café coopers battle pack what also 

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:09.029
 Of course, it is still very great 

00:06:07.110 --> 00:06:09.930
 This polytec that resisted piece which 

00:06:09.029 --> 00:06:12.630
 I see you have a nice one here 

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:14.250
 backdrop for it built and yes to the coffee 

00:06:12.630 --> 00:06:16.289
 coopers perfect I really like that 

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:18.270
 that is really very well done 

00:06:16.289 --> 00:06:19.500
 the battle pack I have one of mine 

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:21.360
 Last videos said that to me 

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:22.560
 maybe do a review but then 

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:24.449
 has anyone comment on it 

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:25.700
 written that this is not necessary 

00:06:24.449 --> 00:06:27.380
 because he already has so many 

00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:29.060
 people have already done a review 

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:31.520
 and that's why I thought it was true 

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:33.050
 that it is true that it would be nonsense 

00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:34.670
 actually doing that because of that 

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:35.930
 I think about what I can do about it 

00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:37.370
 If I think the set is really great 

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:40.640
 well done so there is really 

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:42.890
 very little points of criticism being mine now 

00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:44.630
 just spontaneously comes to mind that the 

00:06:42.890 --> 00:06:46.730
 Weapons are simply bad for children 

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:47.660
 are the good but otherwise find 

00:06:46.730 --> 00:06:49.490
 I'm not so good at it now 

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:52.370
 and that's just not for example 

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:53.630
 control unit for the swap 

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:56.270
 but otherwise it is really 

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:58.100
 Really well done with it 

00:06:56.270 --> 00:07:00.530
 he liked a lot, I'm already on 

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:01.430
 I think for a video for that 

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:03.350
 set 

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:04.580
 but I'm definitely doing something 

00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:05.960
 to do for the set 

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:08.360
 So there will be something 

00:07:05.960 --> 00:07:10.280
 come yes and as I said I like that 

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:12.170
 really so much that I am in front of you 

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:14.390
 Same as yourself a second time 

00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:16.340
 got so that 's it for this 

00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:18.980
 update yes as I said jubilee series 

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:21.170

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:22.670
