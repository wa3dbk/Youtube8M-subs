00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:06.920
 Investment 

00:00:12.769 --> 00:00:14.010
 Engine oil 

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:17.010
 About the influence on the tradition period 

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:23.599
 Each time a phenomenon occurs in the engine, loading of the engine 

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:26.809
 There are residues that also affect efficiency 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:37.030
 This residue is particularly compressive and lubricating around the piston ring 

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.030
 Lower 

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:43.810
 They are 

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:48.040
 In the future, the decrease in combustion efficiency of oki, ie the power of the engine 

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.020
 Reduce 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:53.810
 This increases engine oil consumption and fuel efficiency 

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:56.810
 To do 

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:02.830
 As a result, residue and exhaust gas increase and the engine 

00:01:02.830 --> 00:01:05.830
 The unit is worn out 

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:15.760
 Morita from now on oki and part of its name 

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:17.910
 Break into the crankcase 

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:19.800
 Faster deterioration of engine oil 

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.120
 Failure of the crankcase exhaust system 

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:25.120
 To do 

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:34.410
 Oil line execution stains and other Arai I 

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:38.320
 Poor lubrication of camshaft and engine demand structure 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:39.890
 To do 

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:43.500
 These stains are removed by regular oil change 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.180
 Can you do it 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.400
 Once again in the crankcase to visualize this 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.160
 Let's look at 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:53.650
 When replacing oil make the engine dirty and exhaust 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:54.840
 Will be 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.350
 The wheel is one side of the engine and used 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.690
 Not all the stains of are eliminated 

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:06.130
 Some dirt does not break in the form of a large object but in the lubrication system 

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:07.590
 Will remain 

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.439
 Inject new oil 

00:02:09.439 --> 00:02:11.339
 To start the engine 

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:14.529
 Oil takes up these residues and deposits 

00:02:14.529 --> 00:02:17.529
 The dirt will be noticeable again in a short time 

00:02:18.329 --> 00:02:21.549
 These are the effects of the new engine oil on the Kiyono effect 

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:24.339
 Naturally has an adverse effect 

00:02:24.339 --> 00:02:26.569
 Not only the performance of dust 

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:28.409
 To keep the economy 

00:02:28.409 --> 00:02:32.799
 It is hard to feel the ability every time and cleans the entire system and lubrication system 

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:35.379
 It is recommended 

00:02:35.379 --> 00:02:37.019
 Our cleaning agent 

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:39.749
 Converted to dirty oil before replacement 

00:02:39.749 --> 00:02:42.989
 Please idle the engine for 10 to 15 minutes 

00:02:48.119 --> 00:02:52.389
 During this time, the contamination of the nuclear problem part is broken down to the molecular level 

00:02:54.809 --> 00:02:55.909
 For example 

00:02:55.909 --> 00:02:58.909
 Around piston ring 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:04.049
 Around the exhaust of the crankcase 

00:03:07.179 --> 00:03:09.279
 Lubricant component of camshaft 

00:03:09.279 --> 00:03:12.129
 Etc is the problem part 

00:03:12.129 --> 00:03:14.899
 In this configuration, at the same time as the battlefield 

00:03:14.899 --> 00:03:18.119
 The circulatory component in the product protects the engine 

00:03:19.339 --> 00:03:21.420
 It's fine or bowling 

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:24.420
 The flexibility elasticity of the elastomer is also maintained 

00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:28.569
 This term engine is used but by emissions inside the engine 

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:31.189
 All stains will be added 

00:03:31.189 --> 00:03:32.199
 This 

00:03:32.199 --> 00:03:35.879
 Keep the newly injected oil and lubrication weather clean 

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:38.189
 I will 

00:03:38.189 --> 00:03:41.999
 Finally using a new engine, but in this beautiful environment 

00:03:41.999 --> 00:03:44.589
 Can demonstrate its inherent performance 

00:03:44.589 --> 00:03:49.199
 Lubricant sealing improves the effect of cooling and cleaning 

00:03:55.789 --> 00:03:58.549
 This new clean engine oil 

00:03:58.549 --> 00:04:02.620
 What can even be done by residue and sediment as before 

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:03.169
 Not 

00:04:03.169 --> 00:04:06.419
 Firmly absorb impurities generated inside the engine 

00:04:06.419 --> 00:04:09.419
 To do 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:17.769
 As a result we keep the engine and oil clean 

00:04:18.809 --> 00:04:20.199
 Power improvement 

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:21.670
 Two engine balls 

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:23.159
 Exhaust gas reduction 

00:04:23.159 --> 00:04:25.249
 It is possible to extend the life of the catalyst
