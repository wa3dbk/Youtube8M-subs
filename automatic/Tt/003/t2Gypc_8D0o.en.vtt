00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:41.620 
what you want to do when you're doing

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:46.049 
what you want to do when you're doing
the<00:00:41.710> running<00:00:41.949> man<00:00:42.039> is<00:00:42.839> step<00:00:43.839> on<00:00:44.049> the<00:00:44.170> face<00:00:45.059> so

00:00:46.049 --> 00:00:46.059 
the running man is step on the face so

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:48.389 
the running man is step on the face so
while<00:00:46.539> you're<00:00:46.719> doing<00:00:46.870> this<00:00:47.170> you're<00:00:47.440> stepping

00:00:48.389 --> 00:00:48.399 
while you're doing this you're stepping

00:00:48.399 --> 00:00:52.889 
while you're doing this you're stepping
on<00:00:48.519> the<00:00:48.609> on<00:00:48.879> the<00:00:48.939> base<00:00:49.329> legs<00:00:50.640> like<00:00:51.640> you<00:00:52.000> hit<00:00:52.600> on

00:00:52.889 --> 00:00:52.899 
on the on the base legs like you hit on

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:55.529 
on the on the base legs like you hit on
the<00:00:53.019> base<00:00:54.000> let<00:00:55.000> me<00:00:55.089> just<00:00:55.210> show<00:00:55.359> you<00:00:55.390> a

00:00:55.529 --> 00:00:55.539 
the base let me just show you a

00:00:55.539 --> 00:01:04.469 
the base let me just show you a
run-through<00:01:02.729> so<00:01:03.729> you're<00:01:03.909> stepping<00:01:04.239> on<00:01:04.360> the

00:01:04.469 --> 00:01:04.479 
run-through so you're stepping on the

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:07.139 
run-through so you're stepping on the
face<00:01:04.690> all<00:01:04.929> the<00:01:05.049> time<00:01:05.610> so<00:01:06.610> like<00:01:06.789> basically

00:01:07.139 --> 00:01:07.149 
face all the time so like basically

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:12.289 
face all the time so like basically
you're<00:01:07.600> keeping<00:01:07.990> beat<00:01:08.229> with<00:01:08.470> your<00:01:08.590> feet<00:01:10.049> I

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
you're keeping beat with your feet I

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.490 
you're keeping beat with your feet I
don't<00:01:13.299> know<00:01:13.360> what<00:01:13.509> else<00:01:13.569> there<00:01:13.750> is<00:01:13.899> for<00:01:14.170> music

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:14.500 
don't know what else there is for music

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:16.590 
don't know what else there is for music
that's<00:01:14.649> pretty<00:01:14.890> much<00:01:14.979> it<00:01:15.390> the<00:01:16.390> whole

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:16.600 
that's pretty much it the whole

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.949 
that's pretty much it the whole
hardstyle<00:01:17.140> revolves<00:01:17.890> around<00:01:17.950> the<00:01:18.190> base<00:01:18.959> so

00:01:19.949 --> 00:01:19.959 
hardstyle revolves around the base so

00:01:19.959 --> 00:01:21.840 
hardstyle revolves around the base so
try<00:01:20.200> to<00:01:20.259> pick<00:01:20.500> songs<00:01:20.740> with<00:01:20.979> good<00:01:21.250> steady<00:01:21.580> base

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:21.850 
try to pick songs with good steady base

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:27.050 
try to pick songs with good steady base
so<00:01:22.090> you<00:01:22.179> can<00:01:22.330> just<00:01:22.360> you<00:01:22.600> know<00:01:23.250> running<00:01:24.250> man<00:01:24.369> too

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.240 

so<00:01:28.060> yeah<00:01:28.240> I<00:01:28.299> think<00:01:28.330> that's<00:01:28.659> about<00:01:28.780> it<00:01:28.929> for<00:01:29.250> to

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:30.250 
so yeah I think that's about it for to

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.169 
so yeah I think that's about it for to
the<00:01:30.369> beat<00:01:30.549> like<00:01:32.069> I<00:01:33.069> said<00:01:33.310> before<00:01:33.429> it's<00:01:33.970> all

00:01:34.169 --> 00:01:34.179 
the beat like I said before it's all

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:37.009 
the beat like I said before it's all
practice<00:01:34.720> so<00:01:35.140> he<00:01:35.619> just<00:01:35.799> practice<00:01:36.250> this<00:01:36.429> and

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:37.019 
practice so he just practice this and

00:01:37.019 --> 00:01:39.990 
practice so he just practice this and
it'll<00:01:38.019> come<00:01:38.229> naturally<00:01:38.289> like<00:01:38.890> it's<00:01:39.129> it's<00:01:39.700> not

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.000 
it'll come naturally like it's it's not

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.779 
it'll come naturally like it's it's not
as<00:01:40.090> hard<00:01:40.239> as<00:01:40.300> it<00:01:40.450> looks

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
like you go up instead of going down you

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.650 
like you go up instead of going down you
just<00:02:35.430> go<00:02:35.640> out<00:02:35.930> like<00:02:36.930> you're<00:02:37.260> kicking<00:02:37.829> you<00:02:38.459> know

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:38.660 
just go out like you're kicking you know

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:43.839 
just go out like you're kicking you know
now<00:02:39.660> I'm<00:02:39.750> trying<00:02:39.870> to<00:02:39.989> say<00:02:40.110> like<00:02:41.239> kick<00:02:42.239> kick

00:02:43.839 --> 00:02:43.849 
now I'm trying to say like kick kick

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:48.140 
now I'm trying to say like kick kick
also<00:02:44.849> when<00:02:45.209> you're<00:02:45.360> doing<00:02:45.690> this<00:02:45.840> um<00:02:46.879> your<00:02:47.879> left

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
also when you're doing this um your left

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:50.539 
also when you're doing this um your left
foot<00:02:48.450> slides<00:02:49.019> back<00:02:49.319> the<00:02:49.530> whole<00:02:49.709> time<00:02:49.739> so<00:02:50.400> if

00:02:50.539 --> 00:02:50.549 
foot slides back the whole time so if

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:51.920 
foot slides back the whole time so if
you<00:02:50.639> want<00:02:50.790> to<00:02:50.880> kick<00:02:51.060> more<00:02:51.239> than<00:02:51.420> once<00:02:51.600> it'd<00:02:51.780> be

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
you want to kick more than once it'd be

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:58.680 
you want to kick more than once it'd be
like<00:02:52.139> like

00:02:58.680 --> 00:02:58.690 

00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:01.059 

here's<00:02:59.690> a<00:02:59.780> way<00:02:59.900> of<00:03:00.020> thinking<00:03:00.380> about<00:03:00.470> it<00:03:00.680> like

00:03:01.059 --> 00:03:01.069 
here's a way of thinking about it like

00:03:01.069 --> 00:03:03.699 
here's a way of thinking about it like
all<00:03:01.400> right<00:03:01.670> when<00:03:02.209> one<00:03:02.870> of<00:03:02.989> your<00:03:03.050> foot<00:03:03.380> always

00:03:03.699 --> 00:03:03.709 
all right when one of your foot always

00:03:03.709 --> 00:03:06.640 
all right when one of your foot always
steps<00:03:03.980> to<00:03:04.190> the<00:03:04.280> beat<00:03:04.550> so<00:03:05.170> when<00:03:06.170> you're<00:03:06.349> doing

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:06.650 
steps to the beat so when you're doing

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:09.339 
steps to the beat so when you're doing
this<00:03:06.860> you're<00:03:07.690> stepping<00:03:08.690> to<00:03:08.810> the<00:03:08.930> be<00:03:09.080> right

00:03:09.339 --> 00:03:09.349 
this you're stepping to the be right

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:11.199 
this you're stepping to the be right
think<00:03:10.010> of<00:03:10.130> your<00:03:10.250> other<00:03:10.430> foot<00:03:10.670> doing<00:03:10.880> half

00:03:11.199 --> 00:03:11.209 
think of your other foot doing half

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:13.540 
think of your other foot doing half
beats<00:03:11.569> so<00:03:12.349> like<00:03:12.620> for<00:03:12.860> example<00:03:12.950> if<00:03:13.280> you<00:03:13.370> do<00:03:13.519> just

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:13.550 
beats so like for example if you do just

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:15.759 
beats so like for example if you do just
do<00:03:13.790> the<00:03:13.910> running<00:03:14.120> man<00:03:14.209> one<00:03:14.569> step<00:03:14.930> your<00:03:15.739> left

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:15.769 
do the running man one step your left

00:03:15.769 --> 00:03:18.280 
do the running man one step your left
foot<00:03:16.010> would<00:03:16.220> be<00:03:16.280> doing<00:03:16.640> happies<00:03:17.090> because<00:03:17.390> by

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
foot would be doing happies because by

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:19.900 
foot would be doing happies because by
the<00:03:18.349> time<00:03:18.440> it<00:03:18.890> takes<00:03:19.040> your<00:03:19.400> right<00:03:19.610> foot<00:03:19.880> to

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
the time it takes your right foot to

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:23.670 
the time it takes your right foot to
make<00:03:20.209> one<00:03:20.599> step<00:03:21.519> your<00:03:22.519> left<00:03:22.550> foot<00:03:23.060> would<00:03:23.300> do

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
make one step your left foot would do

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:27.520 
make one step your left foot would do
two<00:03:24.680> slides<00:03:25.040> so<00:03:25.340> it'd<00:03:25.459> be<00:03:26.319> you<00:03:27.319> know<00:03:27.410> what<00:03:27.470> I

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:27.530 
two slides so it'd be you know what I

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:31.059 
two slides so it'd be you know what I
mean<00:03:27.590> like<00:03:27.920> it's<00:03:29.470> now<00:03:30.470> i'm<00:03:30.560> trying<00:03:30.769> to<00:03:30.830> say<00:03:30.950> it

00:03:31.059 --> 00:03:31.069 
mean like it's now i'm trying to say it

00:03:31.069 --> 00:03:33.970 
mean like it's now i'm trying to say it
all<00:03:31.250> right<00:03:31.400> well<00:03:32.230> for<00:03:33.230> case<00:03:33.410> it's<00:03:33.650> the<00:03:33.739> same

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980 
all right well for case it's the same

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.550 
all right well for case it's the same
thing<00:03:34.010> like<00:03:34.930> but<00:03:35.930> you<00:03:36.080> know<00:03:36.200> like<00:03:36.410> i<00:03:36.530> said

thing like but you know like i said
earlier<00:03:36.860> instead<00:03:37.760> of<00:03:37.910> going<00:03:38.180> down<00:03:38.390> you<00:03:38.690> just

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:38.840 
earlier instead of going down you just

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:45.550 
earlier instead of going down you just
kick<00:03:39.560> so<00:03:40.400> it'd<00:03:40.580> be<00:03:40.760> more<00:03:44.349> that's<00:03:45.349> another

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
kick so it'd be more that's another

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:47.979 
kick so it'd be more that's another
thing<00:03:45.799> anything<00:03:46.130> you<00:03:46.400> do<00:03:46.610> in<00:03:46.910> midair<00:03:47.299> your
