00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:24.810
 I have one fresh carrot here 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.289
 chalk therefore 10 of them are many but 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:31.590
 take one such normal bulb 

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:35.610
 200 grams of buckwheat can be washed 250 and 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:37.890

 buckwheat and run the program to extinguish 

00:00:54.090 --> 00:00:59.670

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:13.920
 pieces and send them to the bottom of the bowl 

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:16.680
 multicookers no prior
