see<00:02:27.319> this<00:02:27.440> kind<00:02:27.650> of<00:02:27.709> game<00:02:27.829> play<00:02:28.099> so<00:02:28.579> it<00:02:28.700> does

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:28.910 
see this kind of game play so it does

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:30.160 
see this kind of game play so it does
take<00:02:28.940> a<00:02:29.209> look<00:02:29.390> good<00:02:29.540> amount<00:02:29.810> of<00:02:29.900> research

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:30.170 
take a look good amount of research

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:31.630 
take a look good amount of research
because<00:02:30.440> it<00:02:30.650> is<00:02:30.739> a<00:02:30.769> team<00:02:31.069> game<00:02:31.099> it's<00:02:31.430> not<00:02:31.489> like

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:31.640 
because it is a team game it's not like

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.030 
because it is a team game it's not like
Starcraft<00:02:32.090> users<00:02:32.450> research<00:02:32.840> one<00:02:33.170> player<00:02:33.470> if<00:02:33.920> I

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.040 
Starcraft users research one player if I

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.530 
Starcraft users research one player if I
know<00:02:34.099> okay<00:02:34.370> he<00:02:34.519> likes<00:02:34.670> to<00:02:34.790> run<00:02:35.030> point<00:02:35.269> raised

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:35.540 
know okay he likes to run point raised

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:36.819 
know okay he likes to run point raised
and<00:02:35.870> then<00:02:36.049> you're<00:02:36.200> probably<00:02:36.290> going<00:02:36.530> to<00:02:36.590> expect

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:36.829 
and then you're probably going to expect

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:39.190 
and then you're probably going to expect
boy<00:02:36.950> trees<00:02:37.220> every<00:02:37.400> game<00:02:37.519> with<00:02:37.940> a<00:02:37.970> 5v5<00:02:38.390> depends

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:39.200 
boy trees every game with a 5v5 depends

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.050 
boy trees every game with a 5v5 depends
like<00:02:39.440> differently<00:02:40.010> up<00:02:40.130> on<00:02:40.310> the<00:02:40.430> heroes<00:02:40.700> so<00:02:40.849> if

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
like differently up on the heroes so if

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.100 
like differently up on the heroes so if
you're<00:02:41.150> gonna<00:02:41.239> be<00:02:41.360> running<00:02:41.599> a<00:02:41.630> very<00:02:41.810> gank

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:42.110 
you're gonna be running a very gank

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.530 
you're gonna be running a very gank
heavy<00:02:42.440> versus<00:02:42.769> very<00:02:42.980> turtle<00:02:43.640> heavy<00:02:43.849> could<00:02:44.450> be

00:02:44.530 --> 00:02:44.540 
heavy versus very turtle heavy could be

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:45.940 
heavy versus very turtle heavy could be
very<00:02:44.720> different<00:02:44.900> so<00:02:45.380> there's<00:02:45.680> a<00:02:45.769> lot<00:02:45.920> of

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:45.950 
very different so there's a lot of

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:47.140 
very different so there's a lot of
things<00:02:46.190> that<00:02:46.310> you<00:02:46.370> got<00:02:46.489> to<00:02:46.579> try<00:02:46.790> to<00:02:46.819> keep<00:02:47.000> under

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150 
things that you got to try to keep under

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.180 
things that you got to try to keep under
