00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:05.809
 and I've been in this program for seven years 

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:13.469
 almost all of these men have a 

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:13.469
 violent past that is why they are there 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:21.860
 and get ahead in this kind of 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:21.860
 environment is a great achievement 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:30.610
 the building is 40 is all steel and 

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:30.610
 concrete blocks 

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:39.890
 and walk through those cold corridors of 

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.890
 concrete is a bit depressing 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.560
 but when you are with whom you 

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:48.070
 they strive to apply the principles 

00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:51.060
 biblical you feel at ease the environment 

00:00:48.070 --> 00:00:51.060
 It is very warm 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.390
 when they begin to study one sees that 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.070
 they are aggressive people but then they go 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:03.649
 changing and even getting to see the 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.649
 group with brothers that's awesome 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:08.480
 the meetings are very similar to those of 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.820
 outside 

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:12.170
 they raise their hands participate and 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.730
 discuss with the group what they have 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:19.140
 learned we all left very motivated 

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:19.140
 the faith is strengthened 

00:01:20.659 --> 00:01:24.560
 and many guards appreciate the work that 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:26.869
 we do because they see that the prisoners 

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:30.619
 they change they see them with tie in 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:32.420
 meetings and here no one wears a tie and no 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:34.780
 they hear them say the swear words they use 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:34.780
 others 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:40.960
 but the most amazing change is that of his 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.510
 way of being 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:48.210
 see that now they are peaceful people who 

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:48.210
 They reject violence surprises 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:58.790
 Robert still has little time in this 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:02.960
 program but has made a lot of progress 

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:05.510
 He is burly imposes truth before 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:07.900
 he treated others badly and was extremely 

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:07.900
 aggressive 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.950
 but I've seen that his personality has 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:19.970
 changed 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:23.290
 well I had a very bad temper and I still 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:26.000
 I have but do not learn to fight with him 

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:29.830
 you learn to control it so it looks 

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.830
 that you really want me to help you 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:36.690
 the Bible reaches us to the deepest and 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.690
 it makes us change 

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.790
 when you learn what Jehovah expects from 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:43.350
 you and how much he wants to help you 

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.330
 softens the heart 

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:48.860
 you want to change and live as he wants 

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:48.860
 stop being who you were 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:55.770
 as soon as they learn something from the 

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:58.290
 bible they tell others 

00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:00.360
 if we want to know something where we should 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:03.450
 look in the bible in the word of 

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:05.820
 god when someone listens to the truth and 

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:08.040
 you see in her look that she understood that 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:10.290
 Now he knows that he was cheated because he has 

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:12.840
 seen what the Bible says and that that is 

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:16.640
 important to him that 's the best 

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:16.640
 reward that you can have 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:24.460
 there are prisons everywhere and a lot 

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:24.460
 work to do 

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:31.239
 the witnesses of jehova we try to help 

00:03:28.219 --> 00:03:31.239
 others to improve 

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:36.870
 when observing that these men progress 

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.750
 and that thanks to biblical principles 

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:42.330
 they are better people more people 

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:45.140
 happy you see that it is the best job 

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:45.140
 what can there be
