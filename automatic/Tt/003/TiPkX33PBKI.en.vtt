you like make clones and whatnot out of
brain<00:03:51.629> cells<00:03:51.959> and<00:03:52.319> we<00:03:53.250> see<00:03:53.549> poner<00:03:54.000> up<00:03:54.269> actually

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:55.220 
brain cells and we see poner up actually

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:57.379 
brain cells and we see poner up actually
attacking<00:03:56.220> the<00:03:56.459> brain<00:03:56.669> cells<00:03:56.940> so<00:03:57.060> does<00:03:57.329> that

00:03:57.379 --> 00:03:57.389 
attacking the brain cells so does that

00:03:57.389 --> 00:03:59.449 
attacking the brain cells so does that

mean Joe joseph´s actually dumber than

00:03:59.459 --> 00:04:02.300 
mean Joe joseph´s actually dumber than
is<00:04:00.449> he<00:04:00.629> dumber<00:04:00.900> now<00:04:01.139> is<00:04:01.349> he<00:04:01.500> not<00:04:01.680> as<00:04:01.859> smart<00:04:02.190> as

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:02.310 
is he dumber now is he not as smart as

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:04.699 
is he dumber now is he not as smart as
he<00:04:02.340> usually<00:04:02.909> is<00:04:03.150> because<00:04:03.510> he<00:04:03.870> has<00:04:04.049> brain<00:04:04.409> cells

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709 
he usually is because he has brain cells

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:07.159 
he usually is because he has brain cells
he<00:04:05.340> has<00:04:05.459> less<00:04:05.639> brain<00:04:05.940> cells<00:04:06.269> now<00:04:06.510> than<00:04:06.780> usual

he has less brain cells now than usual

00:04:07.169 --> 00:04:09.319 
he has less brain cells now than usual
so<00:04:07.500> that's<00:04:08.340> something<00:04:08.609> to<00:04:08.729> think<00:04:08.909> about<00:04:09.060> as

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:09.329 
so that's something to think about as

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:10.580 
so that's something to think about as
well<00:04:09.540> but<00:04:09.690> I<00:04:09.750> highly<00:04:10.109> doubt<00:04:10.260> there<00:04:10.470> will<00:04:10.530> be

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
well but I highly doubt there will be

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:14.030 
well but I highly doubt there will be
any<00:04:10.650> repercussions<00:04:11.579> to<00:04:12.260> Joseph's<00:04:13.260> brain

00:04:14.030 --> 00:04:14.040 
any repercussions to Joseph's brain

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:16.219 
any repercussions to Joseph's brain
cells<00:04:14.400> being<00:04:14.699> eliminated<00:04:15.060> by<00:04:15.510> polnareff<00:04:16.049> and

00:04:16.219 --> 00:04:16.229 
cells being eliminated by polnareff and

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:19.580 
cells being eliminated by polnareff and
whatnot<00:04:16.560> but<00:04:17.489> uh<00:04:17.870> it's<00:04:18.870> just<00:04:19.109> cool<00:04:19.380> this

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:19.590 
whatnot but uh it's just cool this

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:20.930 
whatnot but uh it's just cool this
should<00:04:19.769> bring<00:04:19.889> them<00:04:20.130> a<00:04:20.340> little<00:04:20.639> bit<00:04:20.729> more

00:04:20.930 --> 00:04:20.940 
should bring them a little bit more

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:24.769 
should bring them a little bit more
together<00:04:22.580> even<00:04:23.580> though<00:04:23.669> AB<00:04:23.940> AB<00:04:24.210> doll's<00:04:24.510> death

00:04:24.769 --> 00:04:24.779

00:04:24.779 --> 00:04:26.540 
together even though AB AB doll's death
kind<00:04:25.020> of<00:04:25.169> brought<00:04:25.320> them<00:04:25.469> together<00:04:25.620> as

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:26.550 
kind of brought them together as

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:30.499 
kind of brought them together as
I think<00:04:26.879> it<00:04:26.940> probably<00:04:27.090> get<00:04:28.729> but<00:04:29.729> even<00:04:30.180> porn<00:04:30.389> if

00:04:30.499 --> 00:04:30.509
