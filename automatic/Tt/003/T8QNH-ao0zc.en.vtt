remaining<00:00:31.949> black<00:00:32.099> ops<00:00:32.309> 2<00:00:32.520> gameplays<00:00:32.940> and<00:00:33.180> this

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719 
remaining black ops 2 gameplays and this

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:36.319 
remaining black ops 2 gameplays and this
was<00:00:33.870> my<00:00:34.410> number<00:00:34.649> 2<00:00:34.829> it's<00:00:35.520> like<00:00:35.610> a<00:00:35.640> two<00:00:35.850> thousand

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
was my number 2 it's like a two thousand

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:38.900 
was my number 2 it's like a two thousand
score<00:00:36.630> per<00:00:36.750> minute<00:00:36.989> which<00:00:37.110> is<00:00:37.700> unheard<00:00:38.700> of

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
score per minute which is unheard of

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:41.869 
score per minute which is unheard of
like<00:00:39.149> in<00:00:39.570> TDM<00:00:40.020> that's<00:00:40.230> them<00:00:40.379> a<00:00:40.530> lot<00:00:40.800> and<00:00:41.040> I<00:00:41.579> may

00:00:41.869 --> 00:00:41.879 
like in TDM that's them a lot and I may

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:43.430 
like in TDM that's them a lot and I may
or<00:00:42.000> may<00:00:42.120> not<00:00:42.270> get<00:00:42.420> a<00:00:42.480> kill<00:00:42.690> chain<00:00:42.960> at<00:00:43.170> some

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440 
or may not get a kill chain at some

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:45.529 
or may not get a kill chain at some
point<00:00:43.710> so<00:00:43.950> I<00:00:44.430> think<00:00:45.059> it<00:00:45.120> should<00:00:45.210> be<00:00:45.270> pretty<00:00:45.390> fun

00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:45.539 
point so I think it should be pretty fun

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:47.840 
point so I think it should be pretty fun
to<00:00:45.660> watch<00:00:45.750> but<00:00:46.050> yeah<00:00:46.860> I<00:00:47.070> didn't<00:00:47.520> upload<00:00:47.730> a

me<00:02:36.569> in<00:02:36.720> terms<00:02:36.840> of<00:02:37.049> laziness<00:02:37.349> that's<00:02:37.739> why<00:02:37.890> I

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920 
me in terms of laziness that's why I

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.410 
me in terms of laziness that's why I
didn't<00:02:38.190> upload<00:02:38.310> a<00:02:38.459> video<00:02:38.610> this<00:02:38.790> last<00:02:39.000> week<00:02:39.180> but

anyways and also kind of a secondary

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:43.940 
anyways and also kind of a secondary
reason<00:02:42.780> because<00:02:43.200> I<00:02:43.290> probably<00:02:43.439> wouldn't<00:02:43.799> have

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:43.950 
reason because I probably wouldn't have

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.190 
reason because I probably wouldn't have
been<00:02:44.099> playing<00:02:44.430> much<00:02:45.390> Call<00:02:45.659> of<00:02:45.690> Duty<00:02:45.930> anyways
