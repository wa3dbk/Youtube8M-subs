00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:14.250
 music in gta 5 is possible and very 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:18.630
 very easy for that we need to go 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:22.590
 into my library computers and go to 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:25.949
 Documents section and find the folder here 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:29.400
 the growth of rockstar games we go into it 

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:32.850
 gta 5 folder and here is our daddy user user 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:37.350

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:40.320
 you only want beloved and and all 

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:44.910
 this is basically a half done and now 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:47.489
 I 'll show you how to configure and how in general 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.170
 concepts as will be played 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.300
 music so now it is not 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.730
 go directly to the settings 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.219
 for this we actually go to 

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:59.100
 building in the audio section here we have 

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:01.379
 settings and and here is the self radio station 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.370
 radio is our radio in which we are not 

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:04.409
 threw songs 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.659
 the mode has become Friday here you can choose 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.729
 the afterbirth mode is consistent 

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.490
 the song will be one after another playing like 

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:14.460
 did you put up the radio there that is 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.659
 the song is over he will be there something 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.170
 talk and 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:21.360
 statam another song and by chance that is 

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:25.530
 the song will be played perfectly 

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:29.340
 random and random order and here in 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:32.329
 basically everything is already basic this is already 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:36.119
 how are you distributed and so on 

00:01:32.329 --> 00:01:39.329
 set randomly and you should 

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:42.080
 when you sit here let's say here 

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:44.720
 open the radio and here's the top 

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.670
 self radio you should appear on 

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.610
 just in case that she is you for sure 

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:53.300
 appear you need to leave until from 4 somewhere 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:56.690
 songs if about 4 songs then we 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:02:01.220
 Should be in theory this garden will appear 

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:04.280
 radio and his name is calm your kind 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:07.430

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:09.229
 leaving the game inside some how not though 

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:13.520
 folded because you can just open 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:16.310
 through how it is there it is perfect 

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:18.970
 nobody needs and can be so calm 

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:21.550

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:25.360
 crush passersby and
