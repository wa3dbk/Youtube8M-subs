where the lead begins and that'll give

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.620 
where the lead begins and that'll give
me<00:01:49.500> a<00:01:49.530> little<00:01:49.680> transition<00:01:50.340> in<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:50.790> body<00:01:51.030> keep

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:29.310 
you can zoom out and then take your wire

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:30.860 
you can zoom out and then take your wire
and<00:03:29.340> just<00:03:29.640> pull<00:03:30.209> it<00:03:30.330> taut

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:30.870 
and just pull it taut

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:34.760 
and just pull it taut
spin<00:03:31.170> it<00:03:31.319> or<00:03:32.720> not<00:03:33.720> spin<00:03:34.050> it<00:03:34.200> they're<00:03:34.350> just<00:03:34.530> kind

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:34.770 
spin it or not spin it they're just kind

adding<00:04:15.280> this<00:04:15.549> wing<00:04:15.819> case<00:04:16.120> we'll<00:04:16.359> put<00:04:16.539> a<00:04:16.570> little

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:16.720 
adding this wing case we'll put a little

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:19.770 
adding this wing case we'll put a little
goo<00:04:17.019> on<00:04:17.229> there<00:04:17.470> too<00:04:18.299> now<00:04:19.299> I'm<00:04:19.449> going<00:04:19.600> to<00:04:19.660> go

00:04:19.770 --> 00:04:19.780 
goo on there too now I'm going to go

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:23.760 
goo on there too now I'm going to go
ahead<00:04:19.870> and<00:04:20.169> dump<00:04:20.350> the<00:04:21.300> thorax<00:04:22.560> do<00:04:23.560> this<00:04:23.740> a

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:23.770 
ahead and dump the thorax do this a

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:24.900 
ahead and dump the thorax do this a
little<00:04:23.979> heavier<00:04:24.280> because<00:04:24.370> I'm<00:04:24.550> going<00:04:24.639> to<00:04:24.699> pick

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:24.910 
little heavier because I'm going to pick

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:26.629 
little heavier because I'm going to pick
it<00:04:25.030> out

00:04:26.629 --> 00:04:26.639 
it out

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:35.930 
it out
give<00:04:27.639> me<00:04:27.820> the<00:04:27.940> legs<00:04:28.180> I<00:04:28.539> want

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:35.940 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:38.000 

make<00:04:36.270> sure<00:04:36.540> you<00:04:36.690> get<00:04:36.870> back<00:04:37.230> over<00:04:37.650> your<00:04:37.740> wing

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.010 
make sure you get back over your wing

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:44.590 
make sure you get back over your wing
case<00:04:38.310> real<00:04:38.640> well<00:04:39.650> so<00:04:40.650> when<00:04:40.830> you<00:04:40.860> pull<00:04:41.190> forward

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:44.600 

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:49.670 

we<00:04:45.600> have<00:04:45.780> a<00:04:45.810> decent<00:04:47.390> lean<00:04:48.390> case<00:04:48.720> I'm<00:04:49.320> gonna<00:04:49.470> add

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:49.680 
we have a decent lean case I'm gonna add

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.100 
we have a decent lean case I'm gonna add
a<00:04:49.710> little<00:04:49.920> bit<00:04:50.220> dubbing<00:04:50.700> get<00:04:51.510> back<00:04:51.750> just<00:04:51.780> a

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:52.110 
a little bit dubbing get back just a

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:53.630 
a little bit dubbing get back just a
little<00:04:52.140> bit<00:04:53.100> further

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:53.640 
little bit further

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:56.000 
little bit further
looks<00:04:53.850> like<00:04:54.090> the<00:04:54.470> thorax<00:04:55.470> is<00:04:55.650> really<00:04:55.860> much

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:56.010 
looks like the thorax is really much

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:58.190 
looks like the thorax is really much
small<00:04:56.310> so<00:04:56.640> what<00:04:57.480> I'll<00:04:57.570> do<00:04:57.720> is<00:04:57.750> just<00:04:57.870> add<00:04:58.170> a

00:04:58.190 --> 00:04:58.200 
small so what I'll do is just add a

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:07.330 
small so what I'll do is just add a
little<00:04:58.320> building<00:04:58.740> here<00:05:00.650> come<00:05:01.650> back<00:05:02.030> one<00:05:03.030> more

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:07.340 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:09.499 

so<00:05:08.340> there's<00:05:08.550> a<00:05:08.639> lot<00:05:08.789> of<00:05:08.819> different<00:05:09.180> tools<00:05:09.330> to

00:05:09.499 --> 00:05:09.509 
so there's a lot of different tools to

00:05:09.509 --> 00:05:13.219 
so there's a lot of different tools to
pick<00:05:09.810> this<00:05:09.960> out<00:05:10.229> velcro<00:05:10.800> wire<00:05:11.599> be<00:05:12.599> really

00:05:13.219 --> 00:05:13.229 
pick this out velcro wire be really

00:05:13.229 --> 00:05:16.779 
pick this out velcro wire be really
careful<00:05:13.800> around<00:05:14.189> this<00:05:15.150> flat<00:05:15.479> back<00:05:15.870> material

00:05:16.779 --> 00:05:16.789 
careful around this flat back material

00:05:16.789 --> 00:05:23.360 
careful around this flat back material
it<00:05:17.789> will<00:05:18.659> tear<00:05:19.729> with<00:05:20.729> your<00:05:20.939> tools<00:05:21.180> pretty<00:05:22.370> well

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:23.370 
it will tear with your tools pretty well

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:24.920 
it will tear with your tools pretty well
not<00:05:23.550> really<00:05:23.909> easily<00:05:24.180> but<00:05:24.479> you're<00:05:24.659> just<00:05:24.810> going

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:24.930 
not really easily but you're just going

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:31.070 
not really easily but you're just going
to<00:05:24.990> be<00:05:25.110> wary<00:05:27.289> I'm<00:05:28.289> picking<00:05:28.650> out<00:05:28.770> the<00:05:28.949> top<00:05:30.080> and

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:31.080 
to be wary I'm picking out the top and

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:33.820 
to be wary I'm picking out the top and
then<00:05:31.259> I'm<00:05:31.349> just<00:05:31.469> going<00:05:31.650> to<00:05:31.710> pull<00:05:31.949> this<00:05:32.099> over

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:33.830 
then I'm just going to pull this over

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:38.959 
then I'm just going to pull this over
sweep<00:05:34.830> all<00:05:35.069> my<00:05:35.279> materials<00:05:35.789> back<00:05:37.550> and<00:05:38.550> then<00:05:38.669> pin

00:05:38.959 --> 00:05:38.969 
sweep all my materials back and then pin

00:05:38.969 --> 00:05:43.820 
sweep all my materials back and then pin
that<00:05:39.210> around<00:05:40.169> and<00:05:40.529> put<00:05:40.740> one<00:05:42.409> second<00:05:43.409> just<00:05:43.770> to

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:43.830 
that around and put one second just to

00:05:43.830 --> 00:05:46.820 
that around and put one second just to
see<00:05:44.099> where<00:05:44.250> at<00:05:44.490> I'm<00:05:44.759> gonna<00:05:45.529> pull<00:05:46.529> it<00:05:46.650> down

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:46.830 
see where at I'm gonna pull it down

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:50.540 
see where at I'm gonna pull it down
tight<00:05:47.360> put<00:05:48.360> a<00:05:48.389> couple<00:05:48.779> more<00:05:48.810> tight<00:05:49.229> wraps<00:05:49.560> and

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:50.550 
tight put a couple more tight wraps and

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:51.830 
tight put a couple more tight wraps and
then<00:05:50.639> when<00:05:50.789> you<00:05:50.849> cut<00:05:51.090> this<00:05:51.270> you<00:05:51.419> can<00:05:51.509> either<00:05:51.599> do

00:05:51.830 --> 00:05:51.840 
then when you cut this you can either do

00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:53.510 
then when you cut this you can either do
two<00:05:51.870> things<00:05:52.259> you<00:05:52.439> take<00:05:52.650> a<00:05:52.680> razor<00:05:52.949> blade<00:05:53.129> I

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:53.520 
two things you take a razor blade I

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.040 
two things you take a razor blade I
don't<00:05:53.699> have<00:05:53.879> one<00:05:54.090> here<00:05:54.240> with<00:05:54.419> me<00:05:54.629> so<00:05:54.810> what<00:05:54.930> I'm

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:55.050 
don't have one here with me so what I'm

00:05:55.050 --> 00:05:56.330 
don't have one here with me so what I'm
going<00:05:55.229> to<00:05:55.259> do<00:05:55.439> is<00:05:55.590> I'm<00:05:55.710> just<00:05:55.740> going<00:05:56.009> to<00:05:56.099> go<00:05:56.219> in

00:05:56.330 --> 00:05:56.340 
going to do is I'm just going to go in
