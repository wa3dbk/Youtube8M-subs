00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:11.320
 hello, modest Flavors from the kitchen armful loves 

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:14.600
 we have an ethnic description in this section 

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:18.680
 more Circassians will use the description of "AÃ§uka" 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:21.680
 but let's take a look at the list of materials before 

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.640
 1 cup of red pulbiber 

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:30.680
 3 cloves of garlic 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:35.160
 1 teaspoon powder coriander 

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.600
 5 tablespoons olive oil 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.080
 walnut 

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:48.080
 we have learned the necessary materials for acuka 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.600
 let's just say that ... 

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.600
 Each Circassian family has its own acuka recipe 

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.600
 this is missing, i can't say this more 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.400
 we will try to describe the way we learn from a family 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.440
 first of all we are emptying 1 cup of red flake pepper into mixing bowl 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.440
 pepper paste can also be used 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.440
 add water on 

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:20.360
 add water to a consistency like tomato paste 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:30.880
 as you can see the consistency of the pepper paste 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.760
 fresh red hot pepper 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:39.560
 3 tooth garlic we beat on now ... 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:43.640
 1 teaspoon powder coriander 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:49.400
 and very finely added coconut 

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.600
 We will add olive oil soon after 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.600
 continue to mix 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:02.520
 Finally, we add 5 tablespoons of olive oil 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:12.800
 until the olive oil is completely integrated 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.160
 acuka multi-purpose sauce 

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.200
 as you can take to the bread 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.680
 You can also use the recipes of various Circassian dishes 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.120
 there are those who call it 'walnut crushing' 

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.880
 As you can see, the construction of "Acuka" is not difficult at all 

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.200
 so delicious 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.560
 I wish you to remember your experience and Modest Taste as soon as possible 

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.480
 Goodbye sir ...
