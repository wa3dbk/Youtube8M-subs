stuff<00:01:18.990> so<00:01:19.140> there's<00:01:19.350> a<00:01:19.439> little<00:01:19.530> bit<00:01:19.650> of<00:01:19.770> clue<00:01:20.009> on

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
stuff so there's a little bit of clue on

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.609 
stuff so there's a little bit of clue on
what<00:01:20.700> that<00:01:20.850> could<00:01:21.000> be<00:01:21.060> I<00:01:21.450> want<00:01:22.229> to<00:01:22.290> really<00:01:22.470> get

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:22.619 
what that could be I want to really get

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.770 
what that could be I want to really get
into<00:01:22.830> streaming<00:01:23.280> again<00:01:23.520> so<00:01:23.820> that<00:01:24.090> is<00:01:24.450> one

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
into streaming again so that is one

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.359 
into streaming again so that is one
reason<00:01:24.810> I<00:01:25.320> won't<00:01:25.530> be<00:01:25.619> uploading<00:01:25.650> daily

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
reason I won't be uploading daily

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:28.399 
reason I won't be uploading daily
