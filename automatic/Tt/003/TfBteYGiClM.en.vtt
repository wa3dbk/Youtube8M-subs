king<00:02:09.720> they<00:02:10.720> get<00:02:11.080> to<00:02:11.350> either<00:02:11.830> add<00:02:12.430> it<00:02:12.760> to<00:02:12.880> their

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:13.000 
king they get to either add it to their

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.680 
king they get to either add it to their
hands<00:02:13.390> so<00:02:13.450> they

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
hands so they

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:15.870 
hands so they
use<00:02:13.900> it<00:02:14.080> in<00:02:14.110> the<00:02:14.230> future<00:02:14.260> or<00:02:14.740> immediately<00:02:15.700> put

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:15.880 
use it in the future or immediately put

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.310 
use it in the future or immediately put
it<00:02:15.970> in<00:02:16.060> front<00:02:16.150> of<00:02:16.240> them<00:02:16.360> basically<00:02:16.780> for

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.320 
it in front of them basically for

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:18.840 
it in front of them basically for
scoring<00:02:17.710> purposes<00:02:18.220> at<00:02:18.370> the<00:02:18.490> end<00:02:18.610> of<00:02:18.730> the<00:02:18.820> game

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
scoring purposes at the end of the game

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.570 
scoring purposes at the end of the game
if<00:02:19.240> you<00:02:19.960> can't<00:02:20.470> have<00:02:20.590> more<00:02:20.740> than<00:02:20.800> three<00:02:21.160> cards

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580 
if you can't have more than three cards

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:23.160 
if you can't have more than three cards
so<00:02:21.730> if<00:02:21.850> that<00:02:22.000> ever<00:02:22.150> happens<00:02:22.240> you<00:02:22.630> have<00:02:22.660> to<00:02:22.870> put

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:23.170 
so if that ever happens you have to put

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:24.960 
so if that ever happens you have to put
them<00:02:23.290> in<00:02:23.380> front<00:02:23.530> of<00:02:23.650> you<00:02:23.770> so<00:02:24.310> this<00:02:24.670> one<00:02:24.820> output

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
them in front of you so this one output

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:26.100 
them in front of you so this one output
in<00:02:25.180> front<00:02:25.360> of<00:02:25.450> me<00:02:25.510> right<00:02:25.600> because<00:02:25.990> that's

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
in front of me right because that's

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:28.650 
in front of me right because that's
going<00:02:26.320> to<00:02:26.410> be<00:02:26.500> worth<00:02:26.650> two<00:02:26.980> shields<00:02:27.510> then<00:02:28.510> the

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:28.660 
going to be worth two shields then the

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.420 
going to be worth two shields then the
next<00:02:28.900> highest<00:02:29.140> number<00:02:29.260> is<00:02:29.620> the<00:02:29.830> night<00:02:30.070> here<00:02:30.400> so

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
next highest number is the night here so

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:32.010 
next highest number is the night here so
this<00:02:30.880> night<00:02:31.090> is<00:02:31.240> going<00:02:31.360> to<00:02:31.420> go<00:02:31.540> here<00:02:31.780> and<00:02:31.930> he

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:32.020 
this night is going to go here and he

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:33.600 
this night is going to go here and he
takes<00:02:32.260> three<00:02:32.560> cards<00:02:32.890> that<00:02:33.010> are<00:02:33.100> next<00:02:33.340> to<00:02:33.520> each

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:33.610 
takes three cards that are next to each

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.030 
takes three cards that are next to each
other<00:02:33.880> so<00:02:34.690> he<00:02:34.810> takes<00:02:35.020> these<00:02:35.200> three<00:02:35.500> cards<00:02:35.740> and

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:36.040 
other so he takes these three cards and

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.920 
other so he takes these three cards and
again<00:02:36.250> he<00:02:36.760> can<00:02:36.910> score<00:02:37.060> some<00:02:37.240> of<00:02:37.540> them<00:02:37.660> all<00:02:37.810> of

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
again he can score some of them all of

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:40.860 
again he can score some of them all of
them<00:02:38.100> what<00:02:39.100> have<00:02:39.280> you<00:02:39.430> the<00:02:40.150> next<00:02:40.330> guy<00:02:40.480> puts<00:02:40.780> his

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
them what have you the next guy puts his

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.960 
them what have you the next guy puts his
here<00:02:41.290> he<00:02:41.440> could<00:02:41.950> take<00:02:42.130> three<00:02:42.310> cards<00:02:42.550> next<00:02:42.850> to

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:42.970 
here he could take three cards next to

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:44.400 
here he could take three cards next to
each<00:02:43.030> other<00:02:43.150> so<00:02:43.390> he<00:02:43.510> takes<00:02:43.720> these<00:02:43.900> two<00:02:43.960> because

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:44.410 
each other so he takes these two because

00:02:44.410 --> 00:02:46.830 
each other so he takes these two because
he<00:02:44.500> can't<00:02:44.740> get<00:02:44.860> three<00:02:45.370> then<00:02:46.210> the<00:02:46.360> King<00:02:46.600> can

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:46.840 
he can't get three then the King can

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.900 
he can't get three then the King can
take<00:02:46.990> any<00:02:47.230> for<00:02:47.710> cards<00:02:48.220> however<00:02:48.580> there's<00:02:48.790> only

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
take any for cards however there's only

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:51.300 
take any for cards however there's only
one<00:02:49.150> card<00:02:49.450> left<00:02:49.510> over<00:02:50.140> so<00:02:50.650> he<00:02:50.740> takes<00:02:50.860> that<00:02:51.100> one

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:51.310 
one card left over so he takes that one

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.370 
one card left over so he takes that one
if<00:02:51.610> there<00:02:52.390> were<00:02:52.480> any<00:02:52.630> cards<00:02:52.990> left<00:02:53.050> in<00:02:53.260> the

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:53.380 
if there were any cards left in the

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.170 
if there were any cards left in the
bottom<00:02:53.650> row<00:02:53.800> and<00:02:54.040> that's<00:02:54.250> very<00:02:54.370> possible<00:02:54.760> if

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:55.180 
bottom row and that's very possible if

00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:57.300 
bottom row and that's very possible if
you<00:02:55.270> if<00:02:55.420> people<00:02:55.840> had<00:02:55.930> played<00:02:56.200> cards<00:02:56.950> that<00:02:57.100> took

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
you if people had played cards that took

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.030 
you if people had played cards that took
fewer<00:02:57.580> ones<00:02:58.080> then<00:02:59.080> we<00:02:59.200> would<00:02:59.620> move<00:02:59.650> up<00:02:59.860> to<00:02:59.980> the

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:00.040 
fewer ones then we would move up to the

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.850 
fewer ones then we would move up to the
top<00:03:00.190> as<00:03:00.460> is<00:03:00.670> we<00:03:00.940> just<00:03:01.120> draw<00:03:01.390> more<00:03:02.320> cards<00:03:02.500> up<00:03:02.740> at

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:02.860 
top as is we just draw more cards up at

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:04.650 
top as is we just draw more cards up at
the<00:03:02.920> top<00:03:03.070> like<00:03:03.280> this<00:03:03.340> and<00:03:03.850> then<00:03:04.360> we<00:03:04.510> do<00:03:04.630> it

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:04.660 
the top like this and then we do it

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.280 
the top like this and then we do it
again<00:03:04.950> so<00:03:05.950> let's<00:03:06.130> say<00:03:06.280> now<00:03:06.460> the<00:03:06.490> first<00:03:06.970> player

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:07.290 
again so let's say now the first player

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.530 
again so let's say now the first player
plays<00:03:08.290> this<00:03:08.800> peasant<00:03:09.340> here<00:03:09.790> who's<00:03:10.180> going<00:03:10.450> to

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
plays this peasant here who's going to

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.870 
plays this peasant here who's going to
take<00:03:10.720> very<00:03:11.500> exact<00:03:11.980> card<00:03:12.280> so<00:03:12.400> he<00:03:12.430> gets<00:03:12.670> two

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:12.880 
take very exact card so he gets two

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:15.270 
take very exact card so he gets two
cards<00:03:13.240> but<00:03:13.360> they<00:03:13.510> have<00:03:13.780> to<00:03:13.960> be<00:03:14.140> these<00:03:14.950> two

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
cards but they have to be these two

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.940 
cards but they have to be these two
cards<00:03:15.760> here<00:03:16.090> when<00:03:16.570> he<00:03:16.660> plays<00:03:16.900> those<00:03:17.260> the

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:17.950 
cards here when he plays those the

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:19.650 
cards here when he plays those the
princess<00:03:18.459> who<00:03:18.670> can<00:03:18.850> take<00:03:19.060> two<00:03:19.300> different

cards in the line from any spot that she
wants<00:03:22.330> to<00:03:22.360> then<00:03:23.260> we<00:03:23.410> have<00:03:23.530> the<00:03:23.680> bishop<00:03:24.190> will

let's say then another peasant okay so
that<00:03:29.560> we<00:03:29.650> look<00:03:29.770> at<00:03:29.890> the<00:03:29.950> numbers<00:03:30.250> so<00:03:31.090> the

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:31.360

00:05:26.399 --> 00:05:26.409 
fantastic but really is there going to

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:28.709 
fantastic but really is there going to
be<00:05:26.469> anything<00:05:26.800> left<00:05:27.219> over<00:05:27.520> now<00:05:27.999> Kings<00:05:28.389> are<00:05:28.539> more

is<00:05:31.629> two<00:05:32.169> to<00:05:32.349> four<00:05:32.589> so<00:05:32.830> on<00:05:32.919> a<00:05:32.979> two-player<00:05:33.370> game

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:33.580

although<00:06:07.330> we'll<00:06:07.509> take<00:06:07.659> a<00:06:07.689> bit<00:06:07.870> to<00:06:07.899> comprehend

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:08.500 
although we'll take a bit to comprehend

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:10.529 
although we'll take a bit to comprehend
exactly<00:06:09.009> how<00:06:09.159> it<00:06:09.310> works<00:06:09.639> because<00:06:10.120> essentially

00:06:10.529 --> 00:06:10.539 
exactly how it works because essentially

00:06:10.539 --> 00:06:12.149 
exactly how it works because essentially
you're<00:06:10.629> putting<00:06:10.960> a<00:06:10.990> card<00:06:11.199> out<00:06:11.319> there<00:06:11.589> and<00:06:11.770> that

00:06:12.149 --> 00:06:12.159 
you're putting a card out there and that

00:06:12.159 --> 00:06:13.679 
you're putting a card out there and that
card<00:06:12.430> is<00:06:12.520> going<00:06:12.639> to<00:06:12.729> become<00:06:12.969> a<00:06:13.000> reward<00:06:13.509> for

00:06:13.679 --> 00:06:13.689 
card is going to become a reward for

00:06:13.689 --> 00:06:16.170 
card is going to become a reward for
someone<00:06:14.020> next<00:06:14.349> turn<00:06:14.770> that<00:06:15.310> card<00:06:15.610> is<00:06:15.699> basically

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:16.180 
someone next turn that card is basically

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:18.240 
someone next turn that card is basically
letting<00:06:16.389> you<00:06:16.569> decide<00:06:16.899> who's<00:06:17.740> going<00:06:18.069> to<00:06:18.159> go

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:18.250 
letting you decide who's going to go

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:20.189 
letting you decide who's going to go
first<00:06:18.279> and<00:06:18.849> you<00:06:18.909> watch<00:06:19.240> people<00:06:19.659> play<00:06:19.750> them<00:06:20.020> and

00:06:20.189 --> 00:06:20.199 
first and you watch people play them and

00:06:20.199 --> 00:06:22.079 
first and you watch people play them and
what<00:06:20.770> cards<00:06:21.250> you're<00:06:21.399> going<00:06:21.580> to<00:06:21.669> get<00:06:21.789> so<00:06:21.939> all

00:06:22.079 --> 00:06:22.089 
what cards you're going to get so all

00:06:22.089 --> 00:06:25.619 
what cards you're going to get so all
that<00:06:22.300> kind<00:06:22.629> of<00:06:23.399> moves<00:06:24.399> together<00:06:24.669> and<00:06:25.060> it's<00:06:25.509> a

00:06:25.619 --> 00:06:25.629 
that kind of moves together and it's a

00:06:25.629 --> 00:06:28.050 
that kind of moves together and it's a
very<00:06:26.430> fascinating<00:06:27.430> way<00:06:27.550> that<00:06:27.699> the<00:06:27.789> game<00:06:27.939> is

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:28.060 
very fascinating way that the game is

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:29.309 
very fascinating way that the game is
put<00:06:28.240> together<00:06:28.330> and<00:06:28.750> it<00:06:28.839> doesn't<00:06:29.139> take<00:06:29.169> that

00:06:29.309 --> 00:06:29.319 
put together and it doesn't take that

00:06:29.319 --> 00:06:31.290 
put together and it doesn't take that
long<00:06:29.500> we're<00:06:29.889> talking<00:06:30.189> 30<00:06:30.430> minutes<00:06:30.789> tops<00:06:31.000> here

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:31.300 
long we're talking 30 minutes tops here

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:33.240 
long we're talking 30 minutes tops here
but<00:06:31.870> when<00:06:32.050> it's<00:06:32.199> done<00:06:32.349> it<00:06:32.529> feels<00:06:32.680> like<00:06:32.770> whew<00:06:32.949> I

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:33.250 
but when it's done it feels like whew I

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:34.980 
but when it's done it feels like whew I
was<00:06:33.580> able<00:06:33.699> to<00:06:33.849> manipulate<00:06:34.060> the<00:06:34.449> cards<00:06:34.810> the

00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:34.990 
was able to manipulate the cards the

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:37.019 
was able to manipulate the cards the
best<00:06:35.229> or<00:06:35.860> sometimes<00:06:36.339> you'll<00:06:36.490> take<00:06:36.639> a<00:06:36.669> card

00:06:37.019 --> 00:06:37.029 
best or sometimes you'll take a card

00:06:37.029 --> 00:06:39.389 
best or sometimes you'll take a card
that<00:06:37.539> isn't<00:06:38.259> a<00:06:38.289> lot<00:06:38.440> of<00:06:38.560> points<00:06:38.860> but<00:06:39.009> you<00:06:39.129> know

00:06:39.389 --> 00:06:39.399 
that isn't a lot of points but you know
