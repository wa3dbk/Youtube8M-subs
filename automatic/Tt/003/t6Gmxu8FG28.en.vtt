original for now and if we just turn my

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.799 
original for now and if we just turn my
volume<00:00:53.699> up<00:00:54.649> like<00:00:55.649> so<00:00:56.300> basically<00:00:57.300> we<00:00:57.449> have<00:00:57.629> a

00:00:57.799 --> 00:00:57.809 
volume up like so basically we have a

00:00:57.809 --> 00:00:59.779 
volume up like so basically we have a
picture<00:00:58.170> of<00:00:58.289> the<00:00:58.410> gun<00:00:58.649> on<00:00:58.800> the<00:00:58.890> screen<00:00:59.190> along

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
picture of the gun on the screen along

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.849 
picture of the gun on the screen along
with<00:00:59.850> Freiberg<00:01:00.780> just<00:01:01.199> a<00:01:01.260> couple<00:01:01.410> of<00:01:01.559> bullets

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
with Freiberg just a couple of bullets

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:03.170 
with Freiberg just a couple of bullets
down<00:01:01.980> there<00:01:02.250> it<00:01:02.640> really<00:01:02.820> doesn't<00:01:03.059> make<00:01:03.120> a

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
down there it really doesn't make a

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.810 
down there it really doesn't make a
difference<00:01:03.300> and<00:01:04.080> then<00:01:04.320> basically<00:01:04.739> you<00:01:05.670> just

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
difference and then basically you just

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.660 
difference and then basically you just
tap<00:01:05.939> the<00:01:06.090> screen<00:01:06.180> to<00:01:06.420> shoot<00:01:06.600> the<00:01:06.720> gun<00:01:07.159> so<00:01:08.159> the

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:08.670 
tap the screen to shoot the gun so the

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.609 
tap the screen to shoot the gun so the
sound<00:01:08.970> is<00:01:09.150> very<00:01:09.390> realistic<00:01:09.689> it's<00:01:10.080> very<00:01:10.409> loud

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
sound is very realistic it's very loud

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.890 
sound is very realistic it's very loud
as<00:01:10.860> well<00:01:11.360> definitely<00:01:12.360> just<00:01:12.540> from<00:01:12.750> you<00:01:12.840> know

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
as well definitely just from you know

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.510 
as well definitely just from you know
the<00:01:13.110> normal<00:01:13.380> iPod<00:01:13.680> speaker<00:01:14.040> this<00:01:14.159> is<00:01:14.340> this

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:14.520 
the normal iPod speaker this is this

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.969 
the normal iPod speaker this is this
isn't<00:01:14.729> the<00:01:14.880> new<00:01:15.000> iPod<00:01:15.330> or<00:01:15.450> anything<00:01:15.979> so

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979 
isn't the new iPod or anything so

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:18.590 
isn't the new iPod or anything so
obviously<00:01:17.369> would<00:01:17.490> look<00:01:17.670> better<00:01:17.880> and<00:01:18.270> sound

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
obviously would look better and sound

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.120 
obviously would look better and sound
better<00:01:18.750> only<00:01:18.930> no<00:01:19.110> iPod<00:01:19.439> Touch<00:01:19.619> because<00:01:19.950> it<00:01:20.009> has

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.130 
better only no iPod Touch because it has

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:24.440 
better only no iPod Touch because it has
a<00:01:20.369> a<00:01:21.890> speaker<00:01:22.890> so<00:01:23.610> it's<00:01:23.939> the<00:01:24.060> left<00:01:24.210> wrist<00:01:24.330> to

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.450 
a a speaker so it's the left wrist to

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:26.300 
a a speaker so it's the left wrist to
speaker<00:01:24.689> in<00:01:24.840> the<00:01:24.930> dock<00:01:25.110> connector<00:01:25.590> so<00:01:26.040> this<00:01:26.159> is

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
speaker in the dock connector so this is

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.210 
speaker in the dock connector so this is
so<00:01:26.430> gray<00:01:26.640> on<00:01:26.759> the<00:01:26.790> new<00:01:27.000> iPod<00:01:27.299> Touch<00:01:27.509> and<00:01:27.720> iPhone

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:28.220 
so gray on the new iPod Touch and iPhone

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.230 
so gray on the new iPod Touch and iPhone
however<00:01:29.220> it<00:01:29.340> still<00:01:29.520> sounds<00:01:29.759> great<00:01:29.880> on<00:01:30.090> the

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
however it still sounds great on the

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.910 
however it still sounds great on the
second<00:01:30.600> or<00:01:30.810> first<00:01:31.110> generation<00:01:31.229> iPod<00:01:31.890> Touch

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:31.920 
second or first generation iPod Touch

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.679 
second or first generation iPod Touch
the<00:01:32.430> sound<00:01:32.670> is<00:01:32.790> really<00:01:32.909> crisp<00:01:33.299> there's<00:01:33.540> not

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:33.689 
the sound is really crisp there's not

00:01:33.689 --> 00:01:35.090 
the sound is really crisp there's not
really<00:01:33.810> many<00:01:33.990> options<00:01:34.560> you<00:01:34.619> can<00:01:34.799> do<00:01:34.890> with<00:01:35.009> the

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:35.100 
really many options you can do with the

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.100 
really many options you can do with the
gun<00:01:35.340> but<00:01:35.790> I<00:01:36.000> really<00:01:36.270> recommend<00:01:36.390> this<00:01:36.810> you<00:01:36.960> can

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:37.110 
gun but I really recommend this you can

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:38.960 
gun but I really recommend this you can
also<00:01:37.229> tilt<00:01:37.590> the<00:01:37.799> iPhone<00:01:38.220> or<00:01:38.430> iPod<00:01:38.640> Touch<00:01:38.820> as
