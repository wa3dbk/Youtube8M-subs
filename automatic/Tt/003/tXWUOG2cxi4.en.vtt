00:00:01.879 --> 00:00:07.500
 that he is the new 1 from bmw with the 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:09.150
 sporty compact introduced bmw 

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.509
 ten years a vehicle on the market 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:15.290
 the fresh wind brought in the segment 

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:15.290
 unique the rear drive 

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.140
 I believe in the success of the mission 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:21.210
 speaks for itself we have about two 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:24.180
 million units from 1 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.860
 sold we were not surprised because 

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.930
 we were always sure that we were in 

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:29.910
 a unique and compact segment 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.950
 have brand-typical product offerings 

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.270
 bmw use stands with his 

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:35.340
 rear-wheel drive and the powerful 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:40.200
 motors for the brand-typical bmw 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:43.050
 driving pleasure around the success story 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.570
 continue to write and bmw now the new 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.070
 generation at the start 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.930
 the genes of the mission are unmistakable 

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.090
 But in the design of the Munich has 

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:53.840
 manufacturer more than a facelift on the 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.840
 street 

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.760
 at the front we have new led 

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:10.460
 technology thus like the headlights 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:12.890
 of course could have made it narrower 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:15.770
 we have the typical bmw double round bulbs 

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:21.680
 The form directs us to the center of the front 

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:23.600
 there we find the bmw typical us 

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.610
 have new engines and they need it 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.860
 because they have become more efficient 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.750
 That's why we enlarged the kidneys 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:31.850
 that makes the front more sporty 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.229
 the larger openings especially proud 

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.300
 I'm special on that 

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:36.160
 three-dimensionally shaped aspiration of the 

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:38.600
 neighborhood 

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:41.060
 underneath we have very precise lines 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.890
 and they overlook the lower ones 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.450
 Air intakes steer them too 

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:49.009
 become more powerful and sporty 

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:57.140
 the overall effect is a very 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:59.720
 strong and sporty front at the rear of the 

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:02.030
 We also have new led vehicles 

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.530
 We have lights with this technology 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.260
 also made the rear lights narrower 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:10.040
 and we have them the bmw typical 

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:12.739
 look given the leds enable us 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:14.780
 a distinctive light signature and 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:19.160
 a high degree of recognition in the 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:21.170
 darkness horizontal lines stress 

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.850
 the broad and sportiness and the 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.310
 flat rear arches can dare to 

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:27.260
 to stand powerfully in the street 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:30.260
 overall result we see a lot 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:33.040
 wide sporty corner with clear bmw 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.040
 identity 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.900
 with an extensively renewed 

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:45.820
 motor program and additional 

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.550
 Measures to reduce consumption 

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:50.580
 and emissions , the new takes over again 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:52.750
 a pioneering role in the introduction 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:56.460
 current bmw efficientdynamics 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.460
