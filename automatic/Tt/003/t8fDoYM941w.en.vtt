00:00:05.969 --> 00:00:05.979 
okay guys we are on a balloon adventure

00:00:05.979 --> 00:00:16.529 
okay guys we are on a balloon adventure
a<00:00:06.870> Michelle<00:00:11.129> and<00:00:13.200> me<00:00:14.969> yep<00:00:15.969> I<00:00:16.150> know<00:00:16.209> they're

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:16.539 
a Michelle and me yep I know they're

00:00:16.539 --> 00:00:17.490 
a Michelle and me yep I know they're
trying<00:00:16.780> to<00:00:16.810> get<00:00:16.990> us<00:00:17.110> there

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:17.500 
trying to get us there

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:25.320 
trying to get us there
we're<00:00:17.860> here<00:00:18.130> for<00:00:18.310> the<00:00:18.429> inflation<00:00:22.740> yeah<00:00:24.330> and

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:25.330 
we're here for the inflation yeah and

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:31.609 
we're here for the inflation yeah and
we're<00:00:25.449> going<00:00:25.599> to<00:00:25.720> set<00:00:26.080> up<00:00:26.170> our<00:00:26.349> own<00:00:28.140> balloon

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.720 

basically<00:00:32.619> we<00:00:32.740> set<00:00:32.950> the<00:00:33.070> balloon<00:00:33.250> up<00:00:33.430> on<00:00:33.580> its

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:33.730 
basically we set the balloon up on its

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:36.299 
basically we set the balloon up on its
side<00:00:34.110> we<00:00:35.110> fill<00:00:35.320> it<00:00:35.440> full<00:00:35.559> of<00:00:35.620> air<00:00:35.800> with<00:00:36.039> a<00:00:36.070> gas

00:00:36.299 --> 00:00:36.309 
side we fill it full of air with a gas

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:45.119 
side we fill it full of air with a gas
powered<00:00:36.700> fan<00:00:43.469> once<00:00:44.469> the<00:00:44.590> balloons<00:00:44.890> about

00:00:45.119 --> 00:00:45.129 
powered fan once the balloons about

00:00:45.129 --> 00:00:50.549 
powered fan once the balloons about
three-quarters<00:00:45.670> the<00:00:45.699> way<00:00:45.820> full<00:00:46.149> of<00:00:46.270> air<00:00:49.559> when

00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:50.559 
three-quarters the way full of air when

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:52.139 
three-quarters the way full of air when
it's<00:00:50.710> vertical<00:00:50.859> I'll<00:00:51.250> ask<00:00:51.430> you<00:00:51.579> guys<00:00:51.730> to<00:00:51.789> climb

00:00:52.139 --> 00:00:52.149 
it's vertical I'll ask you guys to climb

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:54.029 
it's vertical I'll ask you guys to climb
on<00:00:52.329> board<00:00:52.600> now<00:00:52.750> there<00:00:52.899> is<00:00:52.989> a<00:00:53.020> step<00:00:53.379> in<00:00:53.649> the<00:00:53.800> side

00:00:54.029 --> 00:00:54.039 
on board now there is a step in the side

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:56.279 
on board now there is a step in the side
you<00:00:54.280> can<00:00:54.399> stick<00:00:54.670> their<00:00:54.789> foot<00:00:54.969> into<00:00:55.300> you<00:00:56.170> can

00:00:56.279 --> 00:00:56.289 
you can stick their foot into you can

00:00:56.289 --> 00:00:58.110 
you can stick their foot into you can
grab<00:00:56.530> anything<00:00:56.769> suede<00:00:57.219> to<00:00:57.489> help<00:00:57.670> yourself<00:00:57.969> get

00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:58.120 
grab anything suede to help yourself get

grab anything suede to help yourself get
in<00:00:58.590> okay<00:00:59.590> once<00:01:00.489> you're<00:01:00.640> on<00:01:00.670> board<00:01:00.969> I'll<00:01:01.300> heat

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:01.570 
in okay once you're on board I'll heat

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:03.479 
in okay once you're on board I'll heat
the<00:01:01.660> balloon<00:01:01.899> to<00:01:02.019> buoyancy<00:01:02.320> temperature<00:01:02.890> the

the balloon to buoyancy temperature the
tree<00:01:03.670> will<00:01:03.820> hold<00:01:04.030> us<00:01:04.150> down<00:01:04.180> with<00:01:04.540> their<00:01:04.660> weight

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:04.809 
tree will hold us down with their weight

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:06.240 
tree will hold us down with their weight
when<00:01:05.050> you're<00:01:05.170> ready<00:01:05.350> to<00:01:05.500> go<00:01:05.650> I'll<00:01:05.800> ask<00:01:05.980> them<00:01:06.160> to

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:06.250 
when you're ready to go I'll ask them to

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:07.859 
when you're ready to go I'll ask them to
take<00:01:06.430> their<00:01:06.610> weight<00:01:06.790> off<00:01:06.970> and<00:01:07.000> will<00:01:07.450> float<00:01:07.720> on

00:01:07.859 --> 00:01:07.869 
take their weight off and will float on

00:01:07.869 --> 00:01:10.140 
take their weight off and will float on
out<00:01:08.080> of<00:01:08.200> here<00:01:08.320> how<00:01:08.979> far<00:01:09.009> we<00:01:09.340> go<00:01:09.460> along<00:01:09.790> we<00:01:09.970> fly

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:10.150 
out of here how far we go along we fly

blow different directions at different
altitudes<00:01:23.229> so<00:01:23.829> by<00:01:23.979> changing<00:01:24.220> our<00:01:24.610> altitude

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:24.880 
altitudes so by changing our altitude

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.789 
altitudes so by changing our altitude
which<00:01:25.210> reduce<00:01:25.509> it<00:01:25.659> so<00:01:25.810> they<00:01:26.470> can<00:01:26.650> get<00:01:26.740> a

00:01:26.789 --> 00:01:26.799 
which reduce it so they can get a

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:28.830 
which reduce it so they can get a
different<00:01:27.130> direction<00:01:27.220> sometimes<00:01:27.810> so<00:01:28.810> that's

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:28.840 
different direction sometimes so that's

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:30.660 
different direction sometimes so that's
our<00:01:29.170> steering<00:01:29.560> but<00:01:30.130> every<00:01:30.310> flights<00:01:30.549> an

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:47.680 
if the balloon is traveling with forward

speed relative to the ground when the

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:51.359 
speed relative to the ground when the
moon<00:01:49.899> touches<00:01:50.320> down<00:01:50.470> between<00:01:50.799> touchdown<00:01:51.280> and

moon touches down between touchdown and
something<00:01:51.670> stop<00:01:51.939> but<00:01:52.420> you<00:01:52.509> won't<00:01:52.720> we'll<00:01:52.960> keep

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:53.079 
something stop but you won't we'll keep

00:01:53.079 --> 00:01:55.440 
something stop but you won't we'll keep
going<00:01:53.259> I<00:01:53.770> like<00:01:54.340> people<00:01:54.549> to<00:01:54.700> do<00:01:54.850> is<00:01:55.060> put<00:01:55.270> their

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:55.450 
going I like people to do is put their

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:02.309 
going I like people to do is put their
feet<00:01:55.630> and<00:01:55.840> knees<00:01:55.990> together<00:02:00.990> if<00:02:01.990> the<00:02:02.110> balloon

00:02:02.309 --> 00:02:02.319 
feet and knees together if the balloon

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:03.600 
feet and knees together if the balloon
is<00:02:02.409> traveling<00:02:02.799> with<00:02:02.860> a<00:02:02.950> lot<00:02:03.159> of<00:02:03.189> forward<00:02:03.490> speed

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:03.610 
is traveling with a lot of forward speed

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:05.639 
is traveling with a lot of forward speed
highly<00:02:04.119> unlikely<00:02:04.420> tonight<00:02:04.869> I<00:02:05.049> like<00:02:05.350> to<00:02:05.439> cover

00:02:05.639 --> 00:02:05.649 
highly unlikely tonight I like to cover

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:08.070 
highly unlikely tonight I like to cover
it<00:02:05.770> I<00:02:05.979> mean<00:02:06.970> does<00:02:07.119> that<00:02:07.179> sudden<00:02:07.600> stop<00:02:07.810> thing

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
it I mean does that sudden stop thing

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:09.870 
it I mean does that sudden stop thing
and<00:02:08.830> then<00:02:08.950> a<00:02:08.979> little<00:02:09.190> tip<00:02:09.340> partway<00:02:09.580> on<00:02:09.759> its

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:09.880 
and then a little tip partway on its

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.640 
and then a little tip partway on its
side<00:02:10.060> bounce<00:02:10.720> along<00:02:11.019> a<00:02:11.049> little<00:02:11.260> bit<00:02:11.440> and<00:02:11.560> then

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:11.650 
side bounce along a little bit and then

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:12.870 
side bounce along a little bit and then
stop<00:02:11.890> people<00:02:12.250> saying<00:02:12.400> they<00:02:12.489> think<00:02:12.670> is<00:02:12.790> the

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
stop people saying they think is the
