00:00:01.909 --> 00:00:07.109
 we started three moments what we have 

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:09.820
 made a compilation of all the best 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:13.550
 what he said 

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:19.189
 we have aside the moment of what 

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:20.869
 we have seen Barcelona a long time ago 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:23.150
 time it's on a building to 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:27.410
 to fall I say that the barcelona comes to 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:29.110
 play here and I do not know if it leaves half of table 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:32.000
 because here are not the fields there 

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:36.670
 for here we are going to kick a corner and you 

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.670
 throw a brick 

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.570
 they grabbed his hand now they're 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:46.310
 seriously marking the barcelona I 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:48.320
 I said all my life 

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:50.390
 when when you touch the value and not 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.310
 marked is also your support now if not 

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:54.350
 with madrid was that he broke this and 

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:57.440
 then log the milan now and what 

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:59.540
 discover more does not like iniesta 

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.250
 when we mark it xavi or messi what 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:02.810
 mark over no one likes you 

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.339
 you think they grabbed his hand I think 

00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:06.259
 It's a slump of Barcelona in a moment 

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:08.509
 in which Real Madrid looks that already 

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:11.000
 lost the respect one missed respect 

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:15.140
 Barcelona is not going to be what we 

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:18.790
 had used and that iker is a 

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.790
 great solver of his own mistakes 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:25.490
 those values enlightened in match 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:28.460
 thanks the big party the site is 

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:31.130
 for everyone but if you go clear and apart from 

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.440
 this panda comes kickback and goal of 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:36.790
 madrid great solver in their own 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.790
 errors explain that phrase 

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.899
 and bounce 

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:51.429
 valdÃ©s when with the feet for example 

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:51.429
 in that barcelona that nobody bothered him 

00:01:53.890 --> 00:02:00.020
 when madrid pressed if we go you 

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.789
 they give the ball and you have four types for 

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.219
 receive you and nobody who bothers came out 

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:06.640
 playing very soon on ball point and 

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:06.640
 we are going to
