00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:12.450
 subject together so the subject is 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.340
 how do you see youtube in the future 

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:15.990
 so I saw that other people 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.369
 had already talked about that so I'm going 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.960
 give my point of view on that and you 

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.299

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:24.960
 I saw youtube in the future so 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.780
 already talking about youtube today that 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.520
 the pack on youtube I noticed this is 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.710
 to do live or also I noticed 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.320
 also a lot told his life a little 

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.910
 little tell stories 

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.040
 live scrums also it gets a little 

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:40.950
 little fashion when I say there he got so 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:42.710
 I mean here it is the direct gold in 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.450
 the same time as you start you do the 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:46.440
 gameplay I mean people see you 

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.090
 do it live 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.800
 finally I think you understood me on 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:52.260
 saint justin and still to clarify 

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.940
 we mouais is to make live from the 

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:55.590
 live I see a lot of youtube 

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:58.350
 more and more hours that leave on 

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.840
 platforms like switch that lives or 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:02.520
 dailymotion or even game connection en 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.500
 form I do not know them all but that's it 

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.320
 full of plans of platforms like that 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.569
 so who do live you have noticed 

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.159
 that it's becoming more and more fashionable 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:12.540
 it's true that it looks like a lot of 

00:02:11.159 --> 00:02:13.859
 to do live I say that it looks 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.389
 because I've never done it before 

00:02:13.859 --> 00:02:16.889
 less personally but that's true 

00:02:15.389 --> 00:02:22.709
 that it allows to interact directly 

00:02:16.889 --> 00:02:24.359
 with your subscriber and I look at them 

00:02:22.709 --> 00:02:26.189
 latest videos of some youtuber 

00:02:24.359 --> 00:02:28.709
 so who do live and I notice 

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:31.200
 than their last low video and some 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:33.930
 more small videos of 10 20 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.909
 seconds that are announcements of the i20 

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:39.569
 so in their little video they say 

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:42.030
 do not hesitate to join me on 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:44.909
 this live to come see my thong like 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:48.239
 they say or they are 

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:49.919
 rerun of live while that's 

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:51.540
 that's why I asked myself 

00:02:49.919 --> 00:02:52.980
 question is it youtube in 

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.409
 the future for some and youtube hours 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.299
 or not earlier for some video but 

00:02:55.409 --> 00:03:01.199
 heart it would not be to the species of 

00:02:57.299 --> 00:03:03.299
 social networks like for example bat e 

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:04.859
 twitter or facebook where he announces 

00:03:03.299 --> 00:03:07.319
 things and there it is true that I notice 

00:03:04.859 --> 00:03:09.079
 that youtube for some serves more those 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:10.919
 year old for live 

00:03:09.079 --> 00:03:12.959
 give me your opinion in 

00:03:10.919 --> 00:03:15.239
 comments but it's true that I 

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:16.889
 notice me that youtube for some 

00:03:15.239 --> 00:03:18.509
 it becomes more of a kind of networks 

00:03:16.889 --> 00:03:20.519
 social in passing you just saw 

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:22.889
 that I got my dogs attacked and 

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:24.479
 no yes yes so it'll do even more 

00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:25.919
 that they have it's true that with the yes 

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:27.169
 I will not do too much that they do not have anymore 

00:03:25.919 --> 00:03:29.879
 but it's still ok 

00:03:27.169 --> 00:03:31.199
 so here's me tell me in 

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:33.810
 comments if by the way you are you 

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:35.579
 do live or if you notice 

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:38.220
 also for some and youtube by 

00:03:35.579 --> 00:03:39.659
 example of the youtuber acorns that make 

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:43.009
 a lot of live and who serve as 

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:45.209
 youtube com announce for their live 

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:46.859
 so that's how I see a little bit 

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:48.419
 youtube in the drh not speak for toul 

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:50.579

00:03:48.419 --> 00:03:51.810
 who are doing a simple editing and who 

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:54.299
 the posts on youtube 

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:55.469
 but otherwise for most cerexhe to 

00:03:54.299 --> 00:03:58.829
 say the fashion anyway to make the 

00:03:55.469 --> 00:04:00.199
 stream and after bomba either they make 

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:02.280
 replays on youtube 

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:05.129
 but good here give me your opinion 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:07.229
 in the comments so let's go back on 

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:08.639
 the gameplay of kla here with him yes 

00:04:07.229 --> 00:04:09.530
 I try to make kills better 

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:12.180
 possible 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:13.530
 montseret that I galley a little bit in 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:14.909
 Anyway I hope you like it 

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:16.859
 see dubÃ© wow I notice anyway 

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:17.900
 that people are asking for more 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:19.699
 more 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:21.199
 and especially on the channels 

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:22.460
 community moreover you have it 

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:24.650
 surely seen at the beginning of the video 

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:27.110
 the introduction of coach f because i'm going 

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:30.350
 send them this gameplay so big 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:32.389
 thank you to them six they accept it and 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:34.100
 by the way you subscribers you head 

00:04:32.389 --> 00:04:36.199
 do not hesitate to subscribe to my 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:38.030
 chain there are a lot of black ops has 

00:04:36.199 --> 00:04:40.729
 so if you like blackops I can you 

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:43.699
 ensure that what this chain is doing 

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:45.830
 for you, then we come to the 

00:04:43.699 --> 00:04:47.600
 end of the gameplay and I had noticed down 

00:04:45.830 --> 00:04:49.430
 that I was still doing a big ratio 

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:51.650
 I thought to myself if I'm dying and second 

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:53.510
 times it goes a little bit of a mess 

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:55.550
 so do not take too much 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:57.979
 risk not too dark in the pile and 

00:04:55.550 --> 00:05:00.199
 here is to take his time and so of the 

00:04:57.979 --> 00:05:01.940
 blow the gameplay is coming to an end and me 

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:04.070
 I finished on 1.30 and a sheet that so 

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:05.660
 it's really not bad I hope the 

00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:07.130
 gameplay will have supported you do not hesitate 

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:08.840

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:13.870
