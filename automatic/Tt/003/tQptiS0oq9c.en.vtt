and install some of these on my galaxy

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:37.220 
and install some of these on my galaxy
s3<00:02:34.380> so<00:02:34.560> here<00:02:34.800> is<00:02:34.890> my<00:02:35.070> pebble<00:02:35.340> blue<00:02:35.870> galaxy<00:02:36.870> s3

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:37.230 
s3 so here is my pebble blue galaxy s3

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.910 
s3 so here is my pebble blue galaxy s3
it<00:02:37.380> is<00:02:37.530> the<00:02:37.710> AT&amp;T<00:02:38.130> version<00:02:38.460> it<00:02:39.000> does<00:02:39.210> have<00:02:39.510> a

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:39.920 
it is the AT&amp;T version it does have a

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.920 
it is the AT&amp;T version it does have a
