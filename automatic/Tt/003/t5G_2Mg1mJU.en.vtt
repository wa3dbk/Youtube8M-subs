00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:09.570
 hello everyone welcome to team makeup 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.980
 they are very cool iberia and in today's video 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.750
 I will be teaching you how to make a 

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.250
 homemade mask to remove the points 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:16.800
 blacks that is now super super of 

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.060
 fashion over here in this world is very easy 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.560
 to do what we need are the three 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.060
 ingredients that we surely have in 

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.220
 our houses for that we're going to 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.289
 need unflavored gelatin any 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:28.230
 towards the brand a container suitable for 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:29.640
 microwave and kitchen paper we are going to 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:31.470
 agree on what gelatin would be 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.350
 we're just going to use one of the 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.000
 sachets and we're going to put it in our 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.740
 landmark pots 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.710
 and simply what we are going to do is 

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:42.180
 mix it with what would be water and 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.400
 Now we have to take this in a 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.690
 interval of 10 seconds to the microwave and 

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:47.640
 Now what are we going to do once 

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.020
 our gelatin is ready to start 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.760
 to apply it on the face is what I'm going to 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:55.020
 do I pull my hair out of my face 

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.850
 because it's a bit annoying once 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.410
 we have our face well clear thing 

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.629
 that we do not enter goal we're going to 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.489
 start applying gelatin me what 

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.110
 I'll do is apply with the tennis 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.930
 just make up that you 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.210
 You can use the one you have and 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.710
 checking that the gelatine is not too 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.270
 hot do not go to cheer up the face 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.130
 let's start applying it for our 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:15.960
 most conflictive areas in the case are 

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.270
 the areas of the sides of the nose 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.560
 obviously the nose the area of ​​the 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.190
 chin and I'm also going to apply a 

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.750
 little on the forehead 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:25.190
 once we have applied the 

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:27.710
 gelatin what I'm going to do is go back to 

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:30.710
 take the paper the kitchen paper what 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.420
 we are going to cut and we are going to apply it on 

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.880
 the gelatin that we put this what is going to 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.440
 to do is to help us a lot very much to 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.030
 remove what would be the gelatin and that 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:47.060
 it becomes easier for us 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:48.590
 attraction and now no girls with this 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.480
 face this line the moment to take us 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:55.130
 a simple wait 5 minutes to be 

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:56.870
 dry the mask and once 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.670
 5 minutes passed and no longer seem 

00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:00.800
 plus one gram more let's start 

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.020
 remove what would be the mask we're going 

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.700
 to start taking it out slowly so that 

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:08.060
 we do not hurt our skin like I swear 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:10.880
 that does not smell anything but we're going to start 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.200
 remove it a little bit and let's go 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:14.210
 watching as the face descends a 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.770
 little bit lighter, I think the 

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:18.670
 most conflictive areas are those that go to 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.670
 cost more to take it out 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.920
 and girls ready could have been given 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:27.600

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.190
 do both at 15 minutes and while 

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.170
