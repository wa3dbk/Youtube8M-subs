00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:14.460
 let go or not let go 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.470
 the question is while the french ministers 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.630
 Themis decide how to deal with 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.609
 opposition Kazakhstan politicians 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.550
 Mukhtar ablyazovym whose eve 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.260
 arrested not far from can pickets in 

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:27.000
 his support has already turned around 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:29.340
 embassies of france in moscow and 

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.470
 french consulate you and those 

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.870
 and at least in numbers they are noticeable 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:36.120
 were different but the goal was one 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.579
 oppose a possible decision 

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.010
 french authorities extradite 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:44.570
 the main enemy of the Kazakhstan dictator 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:47.750
 Nazarbayev will be home I hope that 

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:49.060
 Consul General will inform 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.630
 have a terrace 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:53.800
 asus stepping over 

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:56.040
 my position is 

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.700
 drawing time former energy minister 

00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:00.790
 Republic Industry and Commerce 

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:02.470
 Kazakhstan Mukhtar Ablyazov headed 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:04.059
 the largest bank 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:06.220
 however because of its irreconcilable 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:08.110
 political position in dictatorial 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.630
 the regime of Nursultan Nazarbayev 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:13.240
 licked became persona non grata in native 

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:15.340
 Kazakhstan and the past few years has been 

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:18.159
 forced to hide and Britain where 

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:19.930
 received the status of political emigrants by 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:22.899
 some middle president nazarbayev 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:25.390
 so much dream of cracking down on 

00:01:22.899 --> 00:01:27.550
 its main opponent that does not regret 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:30.039
 no means of the latest information 

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:33.160
 to catch ablyazov kazakhstan leader 

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:35.560
 spent 100 million euros on the neck 

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:37.660
 Kazakhstan's national resources have long been 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:41.100
 involved by the Nazarbayev regime for 

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:43.120
 order to buy everywhere and everywhere 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.910
 in his 

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:47.540
 audible manic such desire 

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:49.860
 chase 

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:53.010
 ablyazov 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:55.530
 It means the environment of colleagues and already 7 

00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:58.290
 on the eve of the arrest, very important things happened 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:01.050
 events of the head of two states of Russia and 

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:03.000
 Kazakhstan, talking on the phone is unlikely 

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:05.520
 it will be surprising that after 

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.890
 Detention of Mukhtar Ablyazov in the Media 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.149
 there was information that his extradition 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:11.670
 requires Ukraine 

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:13.710
 Meanwhile, human rights activists say that 

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:14.850
 Russia Ukraine extremely little chance 

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:17.730
 get hold of 

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:20.010
 in Europe mukhtar ablyazov extradition 

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:23.040
 in Kazakhstan and not discussed at all 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:27.750
 it is requested strange from whom not 

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:30.570
 so good reputation and u and edge 

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:32.690
 Ukraine and Will and Russia have a lot 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:34.580
 international complaints 

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:37.200
 human rights institutions 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:41.580
 related torture practices in these countries 

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:44.160
 so I think that France understands this 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:47.360
 the situation is unlikely to betray him 

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:49.680
 traditional issues he is quite 

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.630
 according to migration policy 

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:55.170
 countries can get geographically 

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:57.420
 asylum due to the fact that in his view it 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.530
 it's dangerous to go back or find something 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:02.090
 Great Britain 

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:05.940
 but at 4. territorial asylum 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:11.160
 not issued oh prada migration 

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:13.370
 the prefect service 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.920
 Department where he is now 

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:18.630
 Mukhtar Ablyazov is in the town 

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:19.950
 ex en provence there on August 1 

00:03:18.630 --> 00:03:22.590
 judicial sitting 

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:25.260
 the French court ruled to leave 

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:27.440
 former head of the bank in custody until 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.820
 resolving his possible extradition 

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:32.459
 friendly Kazakhstan, Ukraine should 

00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:36.080
 in 40 days to provide all 

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:36.080
 documents for his issuance
