00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:37.720 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:02:23.780 

Oh

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:26.360 

I<00:02:23.849> could<00:02:24.780> have<00:02:24.930> told<00:02:25.260> you<00:02:25.560> that<00:02:25.590> was<00:02:25.860> pointless

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:26.370 
I could have told you that was pointless

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:32.809 
I could have told you that was pointless
done

00:02:32.809 --> 00:02:32.819 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:37.429 

I<00:02:33.290> am<00:02:34.290> still<00:02:34.650> with<00:02:34.980> us<00:02:35.040> dr.<00:02:35.609> Freeman<00:02:36.060> not<00:02:37.019> for

00:02:37.429 --> 00:02:37.439 
I am still with us dr. Freeman not for

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:41.420 
I am still with us dr. Freeman not for
much<00:02:37.590> longer<00:02:37.620> I<00:02:38.099> think<00:02:39.409> if<00:02:40.409> only<00:02:41.129> you<00:02:41.280> had

00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:41.430 
much longer I think if only you had

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.729 
much longer I think if only you had
harnessed<00:02:41.700> your<00:02:42.060> boundless<00:02:42.659> energy<00:02:42.840> for<00:02:43.709> a

00:02:43.729 --> 00:02:43.739 
harnessed your boundless energy for a

00:02:43.739 --> 00:03:03.670 
harnessed your boundless energy for a
useless<00:02:44.099> purpose

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:03.680 

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:33.170 

I<00:03:05.769> hope<00:03:06.769> you<00:03:06.980> said<00:03:07.250> you

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:33.180 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.750 

Oh

00:03:37.750 --> 00:03:37.760 

00:03:37.760 --> 00:04:16.320 

you're<00:03:38.269> doing

00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:16.330 

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:25.270 

time<00:04:17.709> dr.<00:04:18.709> Freeman<00:04:22.570> is<00:04:23.570> it<00:04:23.900> really<00:04:24.410> that<00:04:24.650> time

00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:25.280 
time dr. Freeman is it really that time

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:29.650 
time dr. Freeman is it really that time
again<00:04:26.560> it<00:04:27.560> seems<00:04:27.950> as<00:04:28.280> if<00:04:28.310> you<00:04:28.880> only<00:04:29.150> just

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:29.660 
again it seems as if you only just

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:34.660 
again it seems as if you only just
arrived<00:04:31.120> you've<00:04:32.120> done<00:04:32.810> a<00:04:33.110> great<00:04:33.440> deal<00:04:34.010> in<00:04:34.550> a

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:34.670 
arrived you've done a great deal in a

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:39.610 
arrived you've done a great deal in a
small<00:04:35.000> time<00:04:35.330> span<00:04:36.910> you've<00:04:37.910> done<00:04:38.510> so<00:04:38.960> well<00:04:39.320> in

00:04:39.610 --> 00:04:39.620 
small time span you've done so well in

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:42.580 
small time span you've done so well in
fact<00:04:39.650> that<00:04:40.100> I've<00:04:40.610> received<00:04:41.300> some<00:04:41.690> interesting

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:42.590 
fact that I've received some interesting

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:46.120 
fact that I've received some interesting
offers<00:04:43.070> for<00:04:43.520> your<00:04:43.670> services<00:04:44.590> but<00:04:45.590> inherently

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:46.130 
offers for your services but inherently

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:48.910 
offers for your services but inherently
I<00:04:46.190> wouldn't<00:04:46.820> come<00:04:47.120> to<00:04:47.330> like<00:04:47.600> them<00:04:47.870> but<00:04:48.110> these

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:48.920 
I wouldn't come to like them but these

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:55.540 
I wouldn't come to like them but these
are<00:04:49.090> extraordinary<00:04:50.170> times<00:04:54.220> rather<00:04:55.220> than

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:55.550 
are extraordinary times rather than

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:58.060 
are extraordinary times rather than
offer<00:04:55.760> you<00:04:56.030> the<00:04:56.240> illusion<00:04:56.540> of<00:04:57.080> free<00:04:57.440> choice<00:04:57.710> I

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:01.070 
will take the liberty of choosing for

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:06.370 
will take the liberty of choosing for
you<00:05:01.550> if<00:05:02.420> and<00:05:03.020> when<00:05:03.860> your<00:05:04.400> time<00:05:04.700> comes<00:05:05.510> around

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:06.380 
you if and when your time comes around

00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:12.160 
you if and when your time comes around
again<00:05:06.860> I<00:05:08.530> do<00:05:09.530> apologize<00:05:10.120> for<00:05:11.120> what<00:05:11.390> must<00:05:11.750> seem
