because we know you guys all love romo
so<00:01:56.579> now<00:01:56.700> we'll<00:01:56.850> take<00:01:56.939> a<00:01:57.000> little<00:01:57.240> bit<00:01:57.329> of<00:01:57.390> a

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
so now we'll take a little bit of a

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.179 
so now we'll take a little bit of a
closer<00:01:57.659> look<00:01:57.899> at<00:01:57.990> the<00:01:58.049> microphone<00:01:58.530> itself<00:01:58.890> and

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
closer look at the microphone itself and

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:01.160 
closer look at the microphone itself and
show<00:01:59.340> you<00:01:59.430> exactly<00:01:59.579> what<00:01:59.939> everything<00:02:00.149> does<00:02:00.329> so

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:01.170 
show you exactly what everything does so

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.139 
show you exactly what everything does so
the<00:02:01.649> microphone<00:02:02.100> comes<00:02:02.310> with<00:02:02.610> a<00:02:02.640> pop<00:02:02.909> shield

00:02:03.139 --> 00:02:03.149 
the microphone comes with a pop shield

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:04.550 
the microphone comes with a pop shield
and<00:02:03.420> built<00:02:03.659> now<00:02:03.840> basically<00:02:04.049> what<00:02:04.350> this<00:02:04.500> does

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:04.560 
and built now basically what this does

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:05.990 
and built now basically what this does
is<00:02:05.009> when<00:02:05.040> you're<00:02:05.280> singing<00:02:05.579> into<00:02:05.909> a<00:02:05.939> microphone

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:06.000 
is when you're singing into a microphone

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.809 
is when you're singing into a microphone
it<00:02:06.630> stops<00:02:06.869> those<00:02:07.049> places<00:02:07.409> so<00:02:07.829> with<00:02:07.979> peds<00:02:08.310> bees

00:02:08.809 --> 00:02:08.819 
it stops those places so with peds bees

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:11.089 
it stops those places so with peds bees
sounds<00:02:09.690> like<00:02:09.810> that<00:02:10.020> that<00:02:10.229> throw<00:02:10.560> out<00:02:10.739> a<00:02:10.770> little

00:02:11.089 --> 00:02:11.099 
sounds like that that throw out a little

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.860 
sounds like that that throw out a little
jet<00:02:11.310> of<00:02:11.430> air<00:02:11.580> it<00:02:11.819> stops<00:02:12.420> them<00:02:12.569> from<00:02:12.599> hitting

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:12.870 
jet of air it stops them from hitting

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:13.820 
jet of air it stops them from hitting
the<00:02:13.050> capture<00:02:13.440> which

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
the capture which

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:15.650 
the capture which
give<00:02:14.160> you<00:02:14.250> a<00:02:14.310> pop<00:02:14.790> sound<00:02:15.030> that's<00:02:15.270> why<00:02:15.390> we<00:02:15.510> call

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
give you a pop sound that's why we call

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.300 
give you a pop sound that's why we call
it<00:02:15.690> a<00:02:15.840> pop<00:02:15.990> shield<00:02:16.230> it<00:02:16.560> also<00:02:16.740> comes<00:02:17.100> with<00:02:17.190> a

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:17.310 
it a pop shield it also comes with a

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:18.440 
it a pop shield it also comes with a
little<00:02:17.430> mount<00:02:17.700> here<00:02:17.940> that<00:02:18.120> you<00:02:18.180> can<00:02:18.330> adjust

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
little mount here that you can adjust

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:20.480 
little mount here that you can adjust
the<00:02:18.780> angle<00:02:18.810> so<00:02:19.290> if<00:02:19.440> you<00:02:19.530> are<00:02:19.650> doing<00:02:19.890> tabletop
