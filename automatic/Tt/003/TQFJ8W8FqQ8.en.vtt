so<00:00:08.460> we're<00:00:08.580> checking<00:00:08.670> out<00:00:08.910> my<00:00:09.090> custom<00:00:09.660> Jase

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
so we're checking out my custom Jase

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.910 
so we're checking out my custom Jase
well<00:00:10.650> I<00:00:10.679> got<00:00:10.980> from<00:00:11.400> case<00:00:11.849> custom<00:00:12.769> this<00:00:13.769> is<00:00:13.889> a

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:13.920 
well I got from case custom this is a

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.599 
well I got from case custom this is a
plastic<00:00:14.219> case<00:00:14.639> as<00:00:14.880> you<00:00:15.120> see<00:00:15.179> here<00:00:15.630> it<00:00:16.379> does

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:16.609 
plastic case as you see here it does

00:00:16.609 --> 00:00:20.720 
plastic case as you see here it does
Bend<00:00:17.609> slightly<00:00:18.920> those<00:00:19.920> are<00:00:20.189> weak<00:00:20.369> points

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
Bend slightly those are weak points

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.620 
Bend slightly those are weak points
there<00:00:20.910> but<00:00:21.119> it<00:00:22.020> is<00:00:22.170> a<00:00:22.199> cast<00:00:22.529> that's<00:00:22.830> the<00:00:23.250> case

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:23.630 
there but it is a cast that's the case

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:25.550 
there but it is a cast that's the case
but<00:00:24.630> it<00:00:24.750> should<00:00:24.930> protect<00:00:25.080> your<00:00:25.320> phone<00:00:25.500> from

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:25.560 
but it should protect your phone from

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:31.759 
but it should protect your phone from
scratches<00:00:26.130> and<00:00:27.439> maybe<00:00:28.439> some<00:00:28.740> drops<00:00:30.619> but<00:00:31.619> the

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:31.769 
scratches and maybe some drops but the

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:33.350 
scratches and maybe some drops but the
actual<00:00:32.040> case<00:00:32.250> is<00:00:32.399> not<00:00:32.520> the<00:00:32.579> thing<00:00:32.850> here<00:00:33.030> it<00:00:33.210> is

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:33.360 
actual case is not the thing here it is

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.780 
actual case is not the thing here it is
the<00:00:33.510> design<00:00:33.930> that<00:00:34.290> I'm<00:00:34.410> worried<00:00:34.649> about<00:00:34.790> very

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
the design that I'm worried about very

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.690 
the design that I'm worried about very
nice<00:00:36.030> design<00:00:36.270> very<00:00:36.780> high<00:00:37.050> quality<00:00:37.700> actually

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:38.700 
nice design very high quality actually

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.750 
nice design very high quality actually
feel<00:00:39.149> that's<00:00:39.989> your<00:00:40.200> texture<00:00:40.620> there<00:00:40.829> so<00:00:41.340> layers

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:41.760 
feel that's your texture there so layers

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.520 
feel that's your texture there so layers
see<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.120> purple<00:00:42.540> would<00:00:42.870> be<00:00:42.989> a<00:00:43.020> first<00:00:43.350> layer

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
see the purple would be a first layer

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.830 
see the purple would be a first layer
they<00:00:43.739> printed<00:00:44.070> on<00:00:44.190> there<00:00:44.399> and<00:00:44.550> then<00:00:45.420> say<00:00:45.660> the

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
they printed on there and then say the

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.350 
they printed on there and then say the
the<00:00:46.110> red<00:00:46.350> and<00:00:46.590> the<00:00:46.710> yellow<00:00:47.120> would<00:00:48.120> be<00:00:48.180> the

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:48.360 
the red and the yellow would be the

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:49.700 
the red and the yellow would be the
second<00:00:48.690> layer<00:00:48.780> I<00:00:48.870> put<00:00:49.110> it<00:00:49.200> on<00:00:49.289> there<00:00:49.469> and<00:00:49.500> you

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:49.710 
second layer I put it on there and you

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.220 
second layer I put it on there and you
can<00:00:49.829> feel<00:00:50.100> that<00:00:50.370> it's<00:00:51.270> a<00:00:51.329> nice<00:00:51.510> texture<00:00:52.079> you've

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
can feel that it's a nice texture you've

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.310 
can feel that it's a nice texture you've
got<00:00:52.410> there<00:00:53.600> yeah<00:00:54.600> it's<00:00:54.719> a<00:00:54.780> very<00:00:54.930> high<00:00:55.260> quality

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
got there yeah it's a very high quality

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.950 
got there yeah it's a very high quality
print<00:00:56.070> that<00:00:56.910> is<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.180> main<00:00:57.360> thing<00:00:57.629> about<00:00:57.690> this

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
print that is the main thing about this

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.610 
print that is the main thing about this
case<00:00:58.199> which<00:00:58.530> makes<00:00:58.710> it<00:00:58.859> good<00:00:59.899> it<00:01:00.899> also<00:01:01.020> is<00:01:01.469> it

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:01.620 
case which makes it good it also is it

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:04.780 
case which makes it good it also is it
is<00:01:01.829> a<00:01:01.859> good<00:01:02.039> case<00:01:02.219> in<00:01:02.430> general<00:01:03.170> if<00:01:04.170> we<00:01:04.320> take

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
this is ed one here they have many cases

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.920 
this is ed one here they have many cases
available<00:01:08.700> for<00:01:08.820> many<00:01:08.939> different<00:01:09.119> devices<00:01:09.479> I

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
available for many different devices I

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:13.190 
available for many different devices I
have<00:01:10.260> the<00:01:10.500> Z<00:01:11.130> one<00:01:11.400> here<00:01:11.610> you<00:01:12.360> can<00:01:12.479> see<00:01:12.659> it<00:01:12.869> fits

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200 
have the Z one here you can see it fits

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:17.510 
have the Z one here you can see it fits
perfectly<00:01:14.330> no<00:01:15.330> problems<00:01:15.689> at<00:01:15.780> all<00:01:16.340> gives<00:01:17.340> you

because who wants to open up these for

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.459 
because who wants to open up these for
shooting<00:01:56.219> facts<00:01:56.549> all<00:01:56.820> the<00:01:56.909> time<00:01:57.149> so<00:01:58.110> I<00:01:58.170> can<00:01:58.320> get

00:01:58.459 --> 00:01:58.469 
shooting facts all the time so I can get

00:01:58.469 --> 00:02:01.730 
shooting facts all the time so I can get
frustrating<00:01:59.100> I<00:01:59.159> guess<00:02:00.049> so<00:02:01.049> you<00:02:01.140> can<00:02:01.290> get<00:02:01.530> your

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 
frustrating I guess so you can get your

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:03.289 
frustrating I guess so you can get your
magnetic<00:02:02.040> charging<00:02:02.520> connector<00:02:02.729> and<00:02:03.090> you<00:02:03.149> can

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:03.299 
magnetic charging connector and you can

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:06.200 
magnetic charging connector and you can
keep<00:02:03.450> the<00:02:03.600> case<00:02:03.810> on<00:02:04.140> when<00:02:04.680> you<00:02:04.740> put<00:02:04.799> it<00:02:04.979> in<00:02:05.210> at

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.210 
keep the case on when you put it in at

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:09.040 
keep the case on when you put it in at
least<00:02:06.360> I<00:02:06.659> guess<00:02:07.079> that's<00:02:07.560> the<00:02:07.710> idea

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:09.050 
least I guess that's the idea

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:10.999 
least I guess that's the idea
yes<00:02:10.050> so

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
yes so

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.410 
yes so
it<00:02:11.580> should<00:02:11.939> offer<00:02:12.950> ok<00:02:13.950> protection<00:02:14.459> as<00:02:15.150> well<00:02:15.360> as

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:15.420 
it should offer ok protection as well as

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.630 
it should offer ok protection as well as
gives<00:02:15.750> you<00:02:15.810> access<00:02:16.079> to<00:02:16.290> any<00:02:16.530> any<00:02:17.040> anything<00:02:17.430> on

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640
