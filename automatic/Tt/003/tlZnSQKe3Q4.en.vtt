00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:11.530
 Well, we're going to need a newspaper 

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:15.250
 Scissors with a container for 

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:19.119
 put the alcohol and enamel here I have 

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:22.410
 the color white and a little rose and 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:22.410
 also a transparent enamel 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:27.180
 very bad first thing we're going to do 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.860
 let's take our newspaper and with 

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:34.550
 our scissors let's start 

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:34.550
 Cut small squares this way 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.320
 well here I have my boxes now 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:45.840
 we make them aside now we take 

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.840
 our varnishes in this case I have 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.239
 22 colors is just for you to see 

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:54.480
 which one they like the most and the white one with another 

00:00:51.239 --> 00:00:58.440
 shortest good color of a hand then 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:01.320
 to paint the color rosita is now 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:04.070
 I'm going to paint on the other hand the color 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.070
 White 

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:13.369
 now we wait for the varnish to dry 

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:16.159
 good since our nails were staked 

00:01:13.369 --> 00:01:19.600
 now our container we are going to throw 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:19.600
 some alcohol 

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:33.610
 Now let's introduce our nail 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:35.830
 alcohol inside leave it there for 

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:37.900
 some seconds but be sure of 

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:40.210
 that is completely wet with the 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:43.000
 alcohol after we take one of our 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:45.880
 little squares that we cut out of the newspaper and 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.190
 we put it like this in this way we have 

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:51.610
 a little squeeze and cough we leave 

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:55.390
 a few seconds later we are removing 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:59.430
 the newspaper very carefully 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:02.560
 and look how they are going to see 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:05.920
 look here you can see there the 

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:07.360
 printed letters here on your nails and good 

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:11.500
 Now we have to do it with all our 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:14.500
 nails and then look like that we have some 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:17.140
 realistic nails very easy to make 

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.810
 truth and nothing else we have a little 

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:23.440
 of enamel and bright to shine 

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:25.780
 and they look much better and well I hope that 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:28.330

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:31.450

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:35.519
