00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:24.400
 on the ground know what's missing 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:25.320
 for 

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.460
 the program will not look good long on the pet and cardboard 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:30.829
 by own fault 

00:00:30.829 --> 00:00:34.310
 this movement is now that movement 

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:37.100
 it is traditional the samba 

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.100
 the sambista on the outside the movement of the arm 

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:43.680
 it's very important of course 

00:00:45.309 --> 00:00:47.199
 etc. practically stopped 

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:50.440
 but with confidence to the point of trafficking political prisoners 

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:53.699
 if you look at these people you're passing very close 

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:55.710
 in their vacancies for the rest of the body 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:58.139
 and that's where the person passes practically stopped 

00:00:58.139 --> 00:01:00.460
 as an important Brazilian movement 

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:04.979
 this feeling that the person is samba in the green river is really being 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:06.410
 without counting 

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:07.829
 there were no delays 

00:01:07.829 --> 00:01:10.030
 whenever she gets up 

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.030
 the co-pilot managed to land the sea 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.740
 when we choose to work with the movement and squares I have to know 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.660
 where are you going to bend right to left 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:27.330
 so let's combine the following 

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:29.980
 if I put it right back 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:33.730
 because in the left front and by the arm the country 

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:35.950
 accompanied the stop ahead 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.710
 when I blame left behind the right is in front of the work the 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:41.540
 companies on the right 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.180
 so do your what if right or left zÃ© spiritist 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:50.510
 for prefect right then it is important you straight from the cabin of the 

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:52.270
 brand think about it 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:54.380
 the orbit of the front land 

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.700
 you who would go from the square left foot and should treat him 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.050
 the attack is as follows 

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:01.259
 I consider 

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:05.139
 I particularly consider infiltration length bets very much 

00:02:05.139 --> 00:02:07.120
 folks 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:08.700
 live better way 

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:09.890
 today for the works 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.179
 the others are more timid 

00:02:12.179 --> 00:02:13.159
 other day 

00:02:13.159 --> 00:02:14.919
 I preferred it already 

00:02:14.919 --> 00:02:16.859
 the radio that quoted 

00:02:16.859 --> 00:02:19.200
 of all types of dengue type 4 

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.680
 how much more horizontal 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.559
 another more up right 

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:23.939
 then movement 

00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:26.939
 so it's important you go from headquarters the way you want to do 

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:32.709
 but it is important that I always follow the leg and that it is 

00:02:32.709 --> 00:02:34.989
 ahead 

00:02:34.989 --> 00:02:39.370
