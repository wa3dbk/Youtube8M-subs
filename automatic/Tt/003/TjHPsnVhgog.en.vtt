very thick and velvety texture just like

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.040 
very thick and velvety texture just like
the<00:01:53.310> goat<00:01:53.880> cheese<00:01:54.119> that<00:01:54.270> were<00:01:54.390> customed<00:01:54.869> to

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:55.050 
the goat cheese that were customed to

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:57.260 
the goat cheese that were customed to
buy<00:01:55.320> at<00:01:55.590> the<00:01:55.680> grocery<00:01:55.710> store<00:01:56.070> but<00:01:56.880> i'm<00:01:57.000> very

happy<00:01:57.479> to<00:01:57.690> report<00:01:58.110> that<00:01:58.200> this<00:01:58.619> weight<00:01:58.890> in

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
happy to report that this weight in

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.249 
happy to report that this weight in
about<00:01:59.430> 8<00:01:59.670> ounces<00:02:00.000> so<00:02:00.540> that's<00:02:00.720> double<00:02:01.229> the

00:02:01.249 --> 00:02:01.259 
about 8 ounces so that's double the

00:02:01.259 --> 00:02:03.740 
about 8 ounces so that's double the
quantity<00:02:01.820> for<00:02:02.820> the<00:02:02.910> price<00:02:03.119> that<00:02:03.149> it<00:02:03.360> cost<00:02:03.570> me

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:03.750 
quantity for the price that it cost me

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.499 
quantity for the price that it cost me
for<00:02:03.960> typically<00:02:04.350> one<00:02:04.740> log<00:02:05.070> I<00:02:05.369> get<00:02:05.670> four<00:02:06.119> ounces

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
for typically one log I get four ounces

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.449 
for typically one log I get four ounces
for<00:02:06.720> about<00:02:06.929> four<00:02:07.200> to<00:02:07.410> six<00:02:07.560> dollars<00:02:08.130> and<00:02:08.310> this

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
for about four to six dollars and this

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:10.580 
for about four to six dollars and this
so<00:02:08.850> far<00:02:09.060> has<00:02:09.179> cost<00:02:09.300> me<00:02:09.509> 350<00:02:10.080> which<00:02:10.440> is

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590 
so far has cost me 350 which is

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.070 
so far has cost me 350 which is
fantastic<00:02:10.769> in<00:02:11.430> itself<00:02:11.700> and<00:02:12.000> so<00:02:12.720> I<00:02:12.750> just

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:13.080 
fantastic in itself and so I just

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:14.449 
fantastic in itself and so I just
realized<00:02:13.410> it<00:02:13.530> with<00:02:13.650> another<00:02:13.920> paper<00:02:14.190> top

00:02:14.449 --> 00:02:14.459 
realized it with another paper top

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:15.890 
realized it with another paper top
because<00:02:14.760> the<00:02:14.880> other<00:02:15.000> ones<00:02:15.390> were<00:02:15.630> getting

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
because the other ones were getting

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.440 
because the other ones were getting
soggy<00:02:16.230> and<00:02:16.500> soaking<00:02:16.890> wet<00:02:17.040> and<00:02:17.400> so<00:02:18.090> if<00:02:18.209> you're

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:18.450 
soggy and soaking wet and so if you're

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:19.880 
soggy and soaking wet and so if you're
if<00:02:18.660> you're<00:02:18.780> using<00:02:18.959> the<00:02:19.080> paper<00:02:19.260> towel<00:02:19.530> method

00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:19.890 
if you're using the paper towel method

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.350 
if you're using the paper towel method
instead<00:02:20.010> of<00:02:20.160> the<00:02:20.280> paper<00:02:20.459> on<00:02:20.670> cheesecloth<00:02:21.120> I

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:21.360 
instead of the paper on cheesecloth I

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.470 
instead of the paper on cheesecloth I
would<00:02:21.450> recommend<00:02:21.720> doing<00:02:21.930> that<00:02:22.110> and<00:02:22.560> it<00:02:23.100> has

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480 
would recommend doing that and it has

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.150 
would recommend doing that and it has
extracted<00:02:24.480> so<00:02:24.989> much<00:02:25.260> liquid<00:02:25.739> from<00:02:25.890> it<00:02:26.070> i'm

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160 
extracted so much liquid from it i'm

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.560 
extracted so much liquid from it i'm
going<00:02:26.280> to<00:02:26.340> let<00:02:26.459> this<00:02:26.610> go<00:02:26.790> for<00:02:26.820> 30<00:02:27.150> more<00:02:27.360> minutes

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:27.570 
going to let this go for 30 more minutes

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.780 
going to let this go for 30 more minutes
and<00:02:27.840> it<00:02:27.930> should<00:02:27.959> be<00:02:28.260> ready<00:02:28.440> for<00:02:29.280> your<00:02:29.430> balsamic
