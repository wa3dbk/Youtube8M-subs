00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
them into pixel art tutorials but that

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:01.910 
them into pixel art tutorials but that
would<00:01:00.359> literally<00:01:00.660> take<00:01:00.989> weeks<00:01:01.559> upon<00:01:01.890> weeks

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
that could eventually add up anywhere

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:06.679 
that could eventually add up anywhere
from<00:01:04.409> two<00:01:04.979> to<00:01:05.010> three<00:01:05.159> months<00:01:05.640> because<00:01:06.420> of<00:01:06.570> the

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689 
from two to three months because of the

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:08.450 
from two to three months because of the
enormous<00:01:07.200> amount<00:01:07.650> of<00:01:07.710> pixel<00:01:08.010> art<00:01:08.130> that<00:01:08.340> I've
