I just grabbed like that back section of
hair<00:04:23.120> and<00:04:24.120> kind<00:04:24.870> of<00:04:24.900> pushed<00:04:25.169> it<00:04:25.349> up<00:04:25.470> a<00:04:25.620> little

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:25.770 
hair and kind of pushed it up a little

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:28.189 
hair and kind of pushed it up a little
bit<00:04:25.979> and<00:04:26.449> we're<00:04:27.449> just<00:04:27.570> going<00:04:27.660> to<00:04:27.810> pin<00:04:28.050> that

00:04:28.189 --> 00:04:28.199 
bit and we're just going to pin that

00:04:28.199 --> 00:04:31.820 
bit and we're just going to pin that
down<00:04:28.259> and<00:04:29.030> instead<00:04:30.030> of<00:04:30.240> crisscrossing<00:04:30.840> my

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830 
down and instead of crisscrossing my

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:33.529 
down and instead of crisscrossing my
pins<00:04:32.190> I'm<00:04:32.550> actually<00:04:32.729> just<00:04:33.060> going<00:04:33.240> to<00:04:33.330> place

00:04:33.529 --> 00:04:33.539 
pins I'm actually just going to place

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:37.100 
pins I'm actually just going to place
them<00:04:33.810> in<00:04:35.539> horizontally<00:04:36.539> so<00:04:36.810> that<00:04:36.960> they're

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:37.110 
them in horizontally so that they're

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:40.010 
them in horizontally so that they're
parallel<00:04:37.560> to<00:04:37.800> each<00:04:37.919> other<00:04:38.539> because<00:04:39.539> we're

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:40.020 
parallel to each other because we're

00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:41.480 
parallel to each other because we're
actually<00:04:40.229> going<00:04:40.500> to<00:04:40.590> be<00:04:40.680> hotting<00:04:41.130> them<00:04:41.310> and

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:41.490 
actually going to be hotting them and

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:42.860 
actually going to be hotting them and
it's<00:04:41.580> going<00:04:41.669> to<00:04:41.729> be<00:04:41.849> a<00:04:41.880> little<00:04:42.060> bit<00:04:42.210> easier<00:04:42.509> to

00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:42.870 
it's going to be a little bit easier to

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:45.379 
it's going to be a little bit easier to
hide<00:04:42.990> them<00:04:43.199> that<00:04:43.410> way<00:04:43.669> okay<00:04:44.669> so<00:04:44.729> that's<00:04:45.090> what

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:45.389 
hide them that way okay so that's what

00:04:45.389 --> 00:04:48.620 
hide them that way okay so that's what
we<00:04:45.479> want<00:04:45.660> right<00:04:45.870> now<00:04:47.000> so<00:04:48.000> now<00:04:48.180> what<00:04:48.360> I'm<00:04:48.449> going

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:48.630 
we want right now so now what I'm going

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:51.890 
we want right now so now what I'm going
to<00:04:48.690> do<00:04:48.870> is<00:04:49.169> take<00:04:49.740> a<00:04:49.949> section<00:04:50.449> right<00:04:51.449> here<00:04:51.510> at

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:51.900 
to do is take a section right here at

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:45.070 
mirror to hold a mirror to look at the

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:46.409

00:06:46.409 --> 00:06:46.419 
back of your hair with because that's

00:06:46.419 --> 00:06:49.409 
back of your hair with because that's
pretty<00:06:46.539> much<00:06:46.690> essential<00:06:47.020> for<00:06:47.500> this<00:06:47.680> and<00:06:48.669> after

00:06:49.409 --> 00:06:49.419 
pretty much essential for this and after

00:06:49.419 --> 00:06:50.760 
pretty much essential for this and after
that<00:06:49.449> all<00:06:49.780> you<00:06:49.900> have<00:06:50.020> to<00:06:50.110> do<00:06:50.229> is<00:06:50.349> just<00:06:50.380> spray

00:06:50.760 --> 00:06:50.770 
that all you have to do is just spray

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:52.350 
that all you have to do is just spray
some<00:06:50.979> hairspray<00:06:51.340> and<00:06:51.760> you<00:06:51.940> should<00:06:52.090> be<00:06:52.120> good<00:06:52.210> to

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:52.360 
some hairspray and you should be good to

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:55.560 
some hairspray and you should be good to
go<00:06:52.479> I<00:06:52.900> think<00:06:53.650> this<00:06:53.830> can<00:06:54.520> be<00:06:54.699> a<00:06:54.910> really<00:06:54.940> casual

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:55.570 
go I think this can be a really casual

00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:57.920 
go I think this can be a really casual
look<00:06:55.870> but<00:06:55.900> I<00:06:56.199> also<00:06:56.380> think<00:06:56.590> that<00:06:56.889> it<00:06:57.250> can<00:06:57.460> be

00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:57.930 
look but I also think that it can be

00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:00.960 
look but I also think that it can be
appropriate<00:06:58.930> for<00:06:58.960> a<00:06:59.199> more<00:06:59.530> dressy<00:07:00.460> occasion

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:00.970 
appropriate for a more dressy occasion

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:04.110 
appropriate for a more dressy occasion
and<00:07:01.240> I<00:07:02.050> really<00:07:02.530> like<00:07:02.800> the<00:07:03.159> effect<00:07:03.520> in<00:07:03.760> the<00:07:03.820> back

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:04.120 
and I really like the effect in the back

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:05.760 
and I really like the effect in the back
it<00:07:04.449> just<00:07:04.870> looks<00:07:05.050> like<00:07:05.229> you<00:07:05.470> know<00:07:05.590> you've

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:05.770 
it just looks like you know you've

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:08.210 
it just looks like you know you've
wrapped<00:07:06.039> your<00:07:06.190> hair<00:07:06.580> and<00:07:06.789> it's<00:07:07.300> kind<00:07:07.510> of<00:07:07.539> like

00:07:08.210 --> 00:07:08.220 
wrapped your hair and it's kind of like

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:11.040 
wrapped your hair and it's kind of like
how'd<00:07:09.220> you<00:07:09.550> do<00:07:09.789> that<00:07:09.820> but<00:07:10.270> then<00:07:10.330> it's<00:07:10.690> really
