00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:25.439 
than anything else and I don't think the

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.259 
than anything else and I don't think the
crowd<00:00:25.619> made<00:00:25.890> more<00:00:26.160> of<00:00:26.189> a<00:00:26.369> I<00:00:26.580> think<00:00:27.150> I<00:00:27.240> just

00:00:27.259 --> 00:00:27.269 
crowd made more of a I think I just

00:00:27.269 --> 00:00:29.269 
crowd made more of a I think I just
played<00:00:27.570> too<00:00:28.349> tight<00:00:28.529> points<00:00:28.949> and<00:00:29.070> then<00:00:29.160> he

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
played too tight points and then he

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.070 
played too tight points and then he
played<00:00:29.490> well<00:00:29.880> the<00:00:30.000> first<00:00:30.210> game<00:00:30.449> and<00:00:30.689> then<00:00:30.960> I

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
played well the first game and then I

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.470 
played well the first game and then I
feel<00:00:31.320> like<00:00:33.170> he<00:00:34.170> sort<00:00:34.530> of<00:00:34.969> let<00:00:35.969> me<00:00:36.090> get<00:00:36.239> ahead<00:00:36.420> in

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
feel like he sort of let me get ahead in

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:37.910 
feel like he sort of let me get ahead in
the<00:00:36.660> second<00:00:36.989> one<00:00:37.079> and<00:00:37.230> not<00:00:37.320> so<00:00:37.469> I<00:00:37.530> was<00:00:37.649> able<00:00:37.770> to

the<00:01:13.110> first<00:01:13.260> year<00:01:13.500> in<00:01:13.590> Australia<00:01:13.710> my<00:01:14.250> wins

00:01:14.539 --> 00:01:14.549 
the first year in Australia my wins

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:17.570 
the first year in Australia my wins
because<00:01:14.820> it<00:01:15.060> was<00:01:15.180> so<00:01:15.360> new<00:01:15.540> to<00:01:15.689> me<00:01:15.720> and<00:01:16.460> maybe<00:01:17.460> a

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:17.580 
because it was so new to me and maybe a

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.460 
because it was so new to me and maybe a
little<00:01:17.729> bit<00:01:17.909> more<00:01:18.060> but<00:01:18.299> general<00:01:18.990> where<00:01:19.200> I<00:01:19.229> am

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:19.470 
little bit more but general where I am

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:20.929 
little bit more but general where I am
now<00:01:19.680> and<00:01:19.979> where<00:01:20.159> I've<00:01:20.250> been<00:01:20.400> the<00:01:20.460> last<00:01:20.580> maybe

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
now and where I've been the last maybe

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:25.039 
now and where I've been the last maybe
two<00:01:21.180> years<00:01:21.210> probably<00:01:21.720> yes<00:01:23.960> what's<00:01:24.960> the

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
two years probably yes what's the

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.270 
two years probably yes what's the
difference<00:01:25.320> now<00:01:25.470> when<00:01:25.650> you<00:01:25.740> get<00:01:25.830> in<00:01:26.009> a<00:01:26.070> long

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:26.280 
difference now when you get in a long

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:28.640 
difference now when you get in a long
rally<00:01:26.520> on<00:01:26.759> clay<00:01:27.030> and<00:01:27.270> maybe<00:01:27.689> a<00:01:27.960> year<00:01:28.350> ago<00:01:28.470> or

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:28.650 
rally on clay and maybe a year ago or

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.060 
rally on clay and maybe a year ago or
whatever<00:01:29.570> in<00:01:30.570> your<00:01:30.750> mind<00:01:30.930> yeah<00:01:31.290> well<00:01:31.619> the

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
whatever in your mind yeah well the

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.730 
whatever in your mind yeah well the
biggest<00:01:32.310> difference<00:01:32.850> is<00:01:33.320> even<00:01:34.320> in<00:01:34.470> the<00:01:34.590> long

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:34.740 
biggest difference is even in the long

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.350 
biggest difference is even in the long
rallies<00:01:35.159> always<00:01:35.460> feel<00:01:35.670> I'm<00:01:35.790> either<00:01:35.939> neutral

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:36.360 
rallies always feel I'm either neutral

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:38.899 
rallies always feel I'm either neutral
or<00:01:36.869> I'm<00:01:37.020> getting<00:01:37.409> sort<00:01:37.650> of<00:01:37.710> a<00:01:37.799> head<00:01:37.979> whereas

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:38.909 
or I'm getting sort of a head whereas

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:41.480 
or I'm getting sort of a head whereas
before<00:01:39.420> the<00:01:39.990> longer<00:01:40.259> the<00:01:40.350> rally<00:01:40.530> went<00:01:41.220> the

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490 
before the longer the rally went the

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.670 
before the longer the rally went the
further<00:01:41.729> back<00:01:41.850> I'd<00:01:42.240> be<00:01:42.420> and<00:01:42.689> the<00:01:42.869> less<00:01:42.899> less

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
further back I'd be and the less less

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:46.160 
further back I'd be and the less less
and<00:01:43.890> less<00:01:43.979> opportunity<00:01:44.850> or<00:01:45.170> possibility

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
and less opportunity or possibility

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:47.690 
and less opportunity or possibility
there<00:01:46.439> was<00:01:46.619> that<00:01:46.799> I<00:01:46.860> would<00:01:46.979> win<00:01:47.250> that<00:01:47.280> point

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:47.700 
there was that I would win that point

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.210 
there was that I would win that point
whereas<00:01:48.420> now<00:01:48.630> I<00:01:48.659> feel<00:01:49.470> like<00:01:49.500> I<00:01:49.680> stand<00:01:49.950> still

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
whereas now I feel like I stand still

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.830 
whereas now I feel like I stand still
pretty<00:01:50.490> close<00:01:50.700> to<00:01:50.880> baseline<00:01:51.180> so<00:01:51.509> I<00:01:51.570> still<00:01:51.780> have

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
pretty close to baseline so I still have

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.289 
pretty close to baseline so I still have
just<00:01:52.530> as<00:01:52.649> equal<00:01:53.009> off<00:01:53.130> an<00:01:53.340> opportunity<00:01:53.970> if<00:01:54.119> it's

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
just as equal off an opportunity if it's

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.420 
just as equal off an opportunity if it's
three<00:01:54.720> shots<00:01:54.990> in<00:01:55.200> the<00:01:55.290> rally<00:01:55.500> or<00:01:55.740> if<00:01:55.860> it's<00:01:56.009> ten

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:56.430 
three shots in the rally or if it's ten
