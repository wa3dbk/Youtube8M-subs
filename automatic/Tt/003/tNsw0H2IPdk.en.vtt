00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:07.950
 Hello, I will show you my wheel 

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:14.190
 means aluminum wheels for a cart with 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:19.610
 polyurethane coated 200 millimeters 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:24.029
 diameter 50 respectively 

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:27.210
 width current note were 

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:31.350
 casting defects when stamping means 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:35.070
 all the portal pierced at the edges where you can 

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:36.210
 it was to get a cutter everything went all here 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:42.079
 everything 

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:45.620
 chamfers are cut on the hub too culture on 

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:49.320
 Naturally all this from two sides here 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:53.579
 machined x axis. 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:56.539
 with a stubborn shoulder with this means you're on 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.469
 30 millimeters diameter is submus 

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:01.410
 30 mm bolt therefore more 

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:05.249
 it is I do not have the world standard thread 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:08.999
 on m12 on what I want to draw your 

00:01:05.249 --> 00:01:10.609
 attention in factory manufacture at 

00:01:08.999 --> 00:01:13.409
 this wheel 

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:16.649
 the edges of the polyurethane coating were 

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:20.969
 chamfering, that is, it was the edges 

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:22.590
 rounded these edges are rounded and 

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:26.670
 when only 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:27.950
 the plane passed with a cutter this smooth one 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.869
 plot 

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.439
 which are directly contact for 

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:34.380
 ribbons 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:36.719
 it turned out with a wheel thickness of forty 

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:39.590
 nine and a half millimeters a smooth 

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:43.649
 involved by these rounds 

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:47.789
 it turned out 44 millimeters 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:48.709
 nuance on this wheel's say you have 

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:50.669
 me yet 

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:53.579
 polyamide coated with polyurethane 

00:01:50.669 --> 00:01:57.439
 also a little bit of a different type of wheel i 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:02:00.790
 I hope here you will see that here 

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:03.300
 shorter is not as rounded as in 

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:06.430
 from on these ie accordingly 

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:10.890
 workers here this surface here is more 

00:02:06.430 --> 00:02:12.570
 and on this wheel due to rounding 

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:15.910
 edges 

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:18.970
 44 mm here when choosing when buying 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:22.590
 wheels consider what you might have 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.590
 such a nuance
