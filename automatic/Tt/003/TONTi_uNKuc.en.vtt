lipoma<00:02:53.650> I<00:02:54.010> don't<00:02:54.460> feel<00:02:54.730> that<00:02:54.880> we<00:02:55.030> need<00:02:55.210> to

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:55.360 
lipoma I don't feel that we need to

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.320 
lipoma I don't feel that we need to
remove<00:02:55.630> it<00:02:55.810> at<00:02:56.050> this<00:02:56.440> time<00:02:56.730> okay<00:02:57.760> it<00:02:58.120> was

00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:58.330 
remove it at this time okay it was

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.290 
remove it at this time okay it was
merely<00:02:58.630> a<00:02:58.780> benign<00:02:59.350> lipoma<00:02:59.920> which<00:03:00.550> is<00:03:00.700> a<00:03:00.730> fatty

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:01.300 
merely a benign lipoma which is a fatty

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.410 
merely a benign lipoma which is a fatty
mass<00:03:01.660> which<00:03:01.990> we<00:03:02.140> see<00:03:02.320> very<00:03:02.590> commonly<00:03:03.100> and<00:03:03.520> dogs

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
mass which we see very commonly and dogs

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.320 
mass which we see very commonly and dogs
often<00:03:04.810> get<00:03:04.990> as<00:03:05.110> they<00:03:05.230> get<00:03:05.380> older<00:03:05.770> they

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:06.330 
often get as they get older they

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:09.330 
often get as they get older they
normally<00:03:07.330> don't<00:03:07.480> cause<00:03:07.810> a<00:03:07.840> problem<00:03:08.260> and<00:03:08.800> so<00:03:09.100> we

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:09.340 
normally don't cause a problem and so we

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.030 
normally don't cause a problem and so we
often<00:03:09.910> watch<00:03:10.390> them<00:03:10.810> sometimes<00:03:11.530> we'll<00:03:11.740> remove

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:12.040 
often watch them sometimes we'll remove

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.760 
often watch them sometimes we'll remove
them<00:03:12.400> it<00:03:13.120> depends<00:03:13.600> in<00:03:13.690> this<00:03:13.870> case<00:03:14.110> watching<00:03:14.440> it

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:14.770 
them it depends in this case watching it

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
signs of a problem right now so we're

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:22.730

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:22.740 
going to take it one step at a time

00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:27.030 
going to take it one step at a time
