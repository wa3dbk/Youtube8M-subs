00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:02.990 

so<00:00:01.680> I've<00:00:01.770> been<00:00:01.920> working<00:00:02.100> on<00:00:02.399> this<00:00:02.580> for<00:00:02.790> about<00:00:02.850> a

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:03.000 
so I've been working on this for about a

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.200 
so I've been working on this for about a
month<00:00:03.179> now<00:00:03.360> and<00:00:03.950> I<00:00:04.950> haven't<00:00:05.250> been<00:00:05.430> very

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:06.210 
month now and I haven't been very

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:07.789 
month now and I haven't been very
successful<00:00:06.450> because<00:00:07.109> it<00:00:07.410> is<00:00:07.560> really

00:00:07.789 --> 00:00:07.799 
successful because it is really

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.919 
successful because it is really
tail-heavy<00:00:08.870> um<00:00:09.870> I<00:00:10.610> guess<00:00:11.610> you<00:00:11.820> fpb<00:00:12.330> guys<00:00:12.570> could

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
tail-heavy um I guess you fpb guys could

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.720 
tail-heavy um I guess you fpb guys could
use<00:00:13.410> this<00:00:13.559> plane<00:00:14.330> or<00:00:15.330> uh<00:00:16.310> I'm<00:00:17.310> gonna<00:00:17.400> get<00:00:17.609> one

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:17.730 
use this plane or uh I'm gonna get one

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.179 
use this plane or uh I'm gonna get one
of<00:00:17.760> those<00:00:17.910> GoPro<00:00:18.600> cameras<00:00:19.080> and<00:00:19.230> just<00:00:19.320> tape<00:00:20.039> it

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:20.189 
of those GoPro cameras and just tape it

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.400 
of those GoPro cameras and just tape it
to<00:00:20.369> the<00:00:20.400> front<00:00:20.760> or<00:00:21.029> attach<00:00:21.480> it<00:00:21.660> somehow<00:00:22.340> but<00:00:23.340> um

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:24.410 
to the front or attach it somehow but um

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:27.080 
to the front or attach it somehow but um
I'm<00:00:25.410> gonna<00:00:25.560> give<00:00:25.710> it<00:00:25.740> one<00:00:25.890> more<00:00:26.160> chance<00:00:26.220> and

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:27.090 
I'm gonna give it one more chance and

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.659 
I'm gonna give it one more chance and
then<00:00:27.779> I'm<00:00:27.960> just<00:00:28.050> gonna<00:00:28.199> move<00:00:28.470> on<00:00:29.660> I<00:00:31.520> got<00:00:32.520> the

00:00:32.659 --> 00:00:32.669 
then I'm just gonna move on I got the

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.729 
then I'm just gonna move on I got the
idea<00:00:32.969> from<00:00:33.210> video<00:00:33.570> on<00:00:33.719> YouTube<00:00:34.160> and<00:00:36.350> all<00:00:37.350> these

00:00:37.729 --> 00:00:37.739 
idea from video on YouTube and all these

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.700 
idea from video on YouTube and all these
measurements<00:00:38.550> and<00:00:38.790> stuff<00:00:38.910> are<00:00:39.440> from<00:00:40.440> what<00:00:40.680> I

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:40.710 
measurements and stuff are from what I

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.010 
measurements and stuff are from what I
thought<00:00:40.980> looked<00:00:41.190> good<00:00:41.250> so<00:00:43.820> yeah<00:00:44.820> it<00:00:45.059> has<00:00:45.210> a<00:00:45.239> 48

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:46.020 
thought looked good so yeah it has a 48

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:48.590 
thought looked good so yeah it has a 48
inch<00:00:46.200> wingspan<00:00:46.620> and<00:00:46.950> a<00:00:47.250> 10<00:00:47.910> inch<00:00:48.090> wing<00:00:48.329> cord

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
inch wingspan and a 10 inch wing cord

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:53.029 
inch wingspan and a 10 inch wing cord
I'm<00:00:49.020> using<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.440> KF<00:00:49.710> airfoil<00:00:51.469> um<00:00:52.469> it's<00:00:52.739> a<00:00:52.800> three

00:00:53.029 --> 00:00:53.039 
I'm using the KF airfoil um it's a three

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:59.540 
I'm using the KF airfoil um it's a three
channel<00:00:53.250> with<00:00:56.570> aileron<00:00:57.570> and<00:00:58.109> elevator<00:00:58.550> and

00:00:59.540 --> 00:00:59.550 
channel with aileron and elevator and

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:13.100 
channel with aileron and elevator and
throttle<00:01:03.350> so<00:01:09.979> and<00:01:11.270> the<00:01:12.270> way<00:01:12.420> attach<00:01:12.750> the<00:01:12.930> wing

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
throttle so and the way attach the wing

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:17.690 
throttle so and the way attach the wing
is<00:01:13.409> with<00:01:14.340> rubber<00:01:14.640> bands<00:01:14.970> i<00:01:16.220> hook<00:01:17.220> him<00:01:17.250> up<00:01:17.490> to

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
is with rubber bands i hook him up to

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.940 
is with rubber bands i hook him up to
this<00:01:17.820> little<00:01:18.000> popsicle<00:01:18.630> stick<00:01:18.840> and<00:01:19.170> just<00:01:19.710> for

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
this little popsicle stick and just for

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:24.010 
this little popsicle stick and just for
them<00:01:20.100> all<00:01:21.000> around<00:01:21.150> and<00:01:21.600> I<00:01:22.560> have<00:01:22.740> my<00:01:22.920> receiver

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
them all around and I have my receiver

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.560 
them all around and I have my receiver
tape<00:01:25.020> to<00:01:25.439> the<00:01:25.590> wing<00:01:25.799> yeah<00:01:26.759> you<00:01:27.180> don't<00:01:27.270> redo

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:27.570 
tape to the wing yeah you don't redo

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.700 
tape to the wing yeah you don't redo
that<00:01:27.720> and<00:01:28.610> above<00:01:29.610> 800<00:01:30.329> kV<00:01:30.479> motor<00:01:30.810> with<00:01:31.110> it<00:01:31.259> with

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
that and above 800 kV motor with it with

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:37.429 
that and above 800 kV motor with it with
an<00:01:31.829> 11<00:01:32.159> by<00:01:32.460> 7<00:01:32.990> inch<00:01:33.990> prop<00:01:34.380> and<00:01:35.780> there's<00:01:36.780> my<00:01:36.930> ESC

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:37.439 
an 11 by 7 inch prop and there's my ESC

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:41.050 
an 11 by 7 inch prop and there's my ESC
and<00:01:37.710> my<00:01:38.310> batteries<00:01:38.759> in<00:01:38.939> there

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:41.060 
and my batteries in there

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:45.289 
and my batteries in there
so<00:01:42.060> yeah<00:01:42.720> I<00:01:42.750> use<00:01:43.020> popsicle<00:01:43.860> sticks<00:01:44.130> to<00:01:44.399> glue

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
so yeah I use popsicle sticks to glue

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.069 
so yeah I use popsicle sticks to glue
down<00:01:45.329> the<00:01:45.509> engine<00:01:46.229> mounts<00:01:46.590> oh<00:01:47.659> yeah<00:01:48.659> and<00:01:48.990> then

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:49.079 
down the engine mounts oh yeah and then

00:01:49.079 --> 00:01:53.990 
down the engine mounts oh yeah and then
I<00:01:49.229> use<00:01:49.439> the<00:01:51.049> landing<00:01:52.049> gear<00:01:52.290> so<00:01:52.710> the<00:01:52.740> prop<00:01:53.729> one

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
I use the landing gear so the prop one

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.069 
I use the landing gear so the prop one
hit<00:01:54.329> the<00:01:54.540> ground<00:01:54.810> whenever<00:01:55.079> it<00:01:55.350> landed<00:01:57.079> this

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
hit the ground whenever it landed this

00:01:58.079 --> 00:02:01.969 
hit the ground whenever it landed this
is<00:01:58.200> a<00:01:58.229> pretty<00:01:58.469> big<00:01:58.680> prop<00:01:58.920> so<00:02:00.439> yeah<00:02:01.439> stay<00:02:01.710> tuned

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
is a pretty big prop so yeah stay tuned

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:04.160 
is a pretty big prop so yeah stay tuned
I'll<00:02:02.790> give<00:02:03.000> it<00:02:03.060> another<00:02:03.119> shot<00:02:03.540> and<00:02:03.600> if<00:02:04.049> it

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:04.170 
I'll give it another shot and if it

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.609 
I'll give it another shot and if it
doesn't<00:02:04.500> work<00:02:04.619> I'm<00:02:04.860> just<00:02:05.009> gonna<00:02:05.100> move<00:02:05.310> on<00:02:05.490> to

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
and then fibia splint I've been working

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.770 
and then fibia splint I've been working
on<00:02:09.679> so<00:02:10.970> yeah<00:02:11.970> let<00:02:12.180> me<00:02:12.209> know<00:02:12.300> if<00:02:12.480> you<00:02:12.540> have<00:02:12.660> any
