00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:26.970 
over here now there are 16 different

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.580 
over here now there are 16 different
ways<00:00:27.330> that<00:00:27.539> you<00:00:27.660> can<00:00:27.779> place<00:00:28.019> them<00:00:28.289> so<00:00:28.470> in

00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:28.590 
ways that you can place them so in

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.560 
ways that you can place them so in
between<00:00:28.710> each<00:00:29.130> one<00:00:29.340> that<00:00:29.550> faces<00:00:29.730> an<00:00:30.150> axis

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:30.570 
between each one that faces an axis

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.840 
between each one that faces an axis
there<00:00:31.140> are<00:00:31.289> free<00:00:31.560> variants<00:00:32.040> like<00:00:32.189> that<00:00:32.520> so<00:00:32.790> you

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
there are free variants like that so you

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:34.490 
there are free variants like that so you
have<00:00:32.910> some<00:00:33.270> options<00:00:33.450> as<00:00:33.840> to<00:00:33.870> how<00:00:34.110> you<00:00:34.290> can

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:34.500 
have some options as to how you can

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:36.380 
have some options as to how you can
place<00:00:34.680> them<00:00:34.860> down<00:00:35.010> you<00:00:35.550> can<00:00:35.700> also<00:00:35.969> customize

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:36.390 
place them down you can also customize

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.500 
place them down you can also customize
them<00:00:37.020> and<00:00:37.230> there<00:00:38.010> are<00:00:38.160> around<00:00:38.579> 4<00:00:39.090> trillion

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
them and there are around 4 trillion

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.810 
them and there are around 4 trillion
different<00:00:39.930> combinations<00:00:40.290> of<00:00:41.040> flags<00:00:41.460> and

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
different combinations of flags and

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:43.880 
different combinations of flags and
colors<00:00:42.270> and<00:00:42.540> things<00:00:42.719> that<00:00:42.809> you<00:00:42.989> can<00:00:43.140> do<00:00:43.320> with

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
colors and things that you can do with

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:45.410 
colors and things that you can do with
each<00:00:44.100> of<00:00:44.340> these<00:00:44.430> so<00:00:44.700> you<00:00:44.760> can<00:00:44.850> make<00:00:45.120> them<00:00:45.239> look

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
each of these so you can make them look

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.389 
each of these so you can make them look
like<00:00:45.480> these<00:00:46.230> different<00:00:46.559> patterns<00:00:46.739> right<00:00:47.160> here

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
like these different patterns right here

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:48.619 
like these different patterns right here
and<00:00:47.489> I'm<00:00:47.550> going<00:00:47.640> to<00:00:47.730> show<00:00:47.879> you<00:00:47.940> how<00:00:48.090> to<00:00:48.120> do<00:00:48.450> all

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 
and I'm going to show you how to do all

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:50.360 
and I'm going to show you how to do all
of<00:00:48.660> that<00:00:48.809> in<00:00:49.079> a<00:00:49.469> second<00:00:49.950> but<00:00:50.070> if<00:00:50.129> we<00:00:50.219> have<00:00:50.340> a

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
of that in a second but if we have a

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.740 
of that in a second but if we have a
quick<00:00:50.550> look<00:00:50.789> over<00:00:50.969> here<00:00:51.300> there<00:00:51.449> are<00:00:51.510> a<00:00:51.570> couple

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:51.750 
quick look over here there are a couple

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:53.990 
quick look over here there are a couple
of<00:00:51.870> things<00:00:52.020> I<00:00:52.230> wanted<00:00:52.410> to<00:00:52.559> point<00:00:52.800> out<00:00:53.070> that<00:00:53.280> the

00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:54.000 
of things I wanted to point out that the

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.090 
of things I wanted to point out that the
hitbox<00:00:54.420> of<00:00:54.600> this<00:00:54.719> thing<00:00:54.989> is<00:00:55.199> only<00:00:55.469> inside<00:00:55.890> the

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100 
hitbox of this thing is only inside the

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:57.529 
hitbox of this thing is only inside the
first<00:00:56.370> block<00:00:56.640> so<00:00:56.789> you<00:00:56.850> can<00:00:57.000> actually<00:00:57.120> place

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
first block so you can actually place

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.360 
first block so you can actually place
blocks<00:00:57.870> above<00:00:58.289> them<00:00:58.559> which<00:00:59.010> could<00:00:59.250> possibly

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
blocks above them which could possibly

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.279 
blocks above them which could possibly
be<00:00:59.699> useful<00:01:00.059> for<00:01:00.420> decorations

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
be useful for decorations

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.770 
be useful for decorations
the<00:01:01.710> idea<00:01:02.100> of<00:01:02.160> a<00:01:02.579> window<00:01:02.910> comes<00:01:03.180> to<00:01:03.390> mind<00:01:03.629> with

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:03.780 
the idea of a window comes to mind with

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.299 
the idea of a window comes to mind with
some<00:01:04.019> curtains<00:01:04.379> hanging<00:01:04.559> down<00:01:04.799> or<00:01:04.979> something

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
some curtains hanging down or something

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:06.710 
some curtains hanging down or something
like<00:01:05.430> this<00:01:05.670> but<00:01:05.850> there<00:01:05.970> are<00:01:06.030> going<00:01:06.119> to<00:01:06.180> be<00:01:06.240> all

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:06.720 
like this but there are going to be all

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.870 
like this but there are going to be all
sorts<00:01:07.020> of<00:01:07.200> possibilities<00:01:07.920> for<00:01:07.950> how<00:01:08.490> you<00:01:08.549> can

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
sorts of possibilities for how you can

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.359 
sorts of possibilities for how you can
use<00:01:09.119> these<00:01:09.299> and<00:01:09.540> also<00:01:09.750> in<00:01:10.260> creative<00:01:11.010> mode<00:01:11.040> you

00:01:11.359 --> 00:01:11.369 
use these and also in creative mode you

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.429 
use these and also in creative mode you
can<00:01:11.549> put<00:01:11.729> them<00:01:11.909> on<00:01:12.090> your<00:01:12.299> head<00:01:12.479> but<00:01:13.049> I<00:01:13.110> haven't

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
it is in the head slap here which can't

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:20.990 
it is in the head slap here which can't
be<00:01:18.659> done<00:01:18.840> in<00:01:19.320> survival<00:01:20.100> mode<00:01:20.130> you<00:01:20.340> have<00:01:20.369> to<00:01:20.549> do

be done in survival mode you have to do
it<00:01:21.119> using<00:01:21.299> a<00:01:21.600> command<00:01:21.930> block<00:01:22.200> and<00:01:22.549> then<00:01:23.549> you

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:23.670 
it using a command block and then you

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:24.950 
it using a command block and then you
could<00:01:23.820> do<00:01:23.939> capture<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.450> flag<00:01:24.659> or<00:01:24.869> something

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:24.960 
could do capture the flag or something

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.530 
could do capture the flag or something
like<00:01:25.560> that<00:01:25.860> so<00:01:26.400> let<00:01:26.549> me<00:01:26.640> show<00:01:26.790> you<00:01:26.880> how<00:01:27.030> this<00:01:27.210> is

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.060 
crafted we take a single stick put it at
the<00:01:29.820> bottom<00:01:29.970> and<00:01:30.360> then<00:01:31.020> put<00:01:31.229> 6<00:01:31.530> wall<00:01:31.770> at<00:01:31.979> the

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070 
the bottom and then put 6 wall at the

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.550 
the bottom and then put 6 wall at the
top<00:01:32.310> and<00:01:32.520> that<00:01:32.850> will<00:01:32.970> create<00:01:33.150> our<00:01:33.420> banner<00:01:33.810> like

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
top and that will create our banner like

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.560 
top and that will create our banner like
this<00:01:34.829> and<00:01:35.130> then<00:01:35.250> you<00:01:35.340> can<00:01:35.490> customize<00:01:35.670> this<00:01:36.299> up

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570 
this and then you can customize this up

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.390 
this and then you can customize this up
to<00:01:36.780> 6<00:01:37.110> different<00:01:37.320> times<00:01:37.770> so<00:01:38.070> that<00:01:38.189> is<00:01:38.280> actually

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:38.400 
to 6 different times so that is actually

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.580 
to 6 different times so that is actually
quite<00:01:38.820> important<00:01:39.329> if<00:01:39.450> we<00:01:39.540> have<00:01:39.659> a<00:01:39.689> look<00:01:39.869> at<00:01:40.409> the

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
quite important if we have a look at the

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:41.990 
quite important if we have a look at the
patterns<00:01:41.070> and<00:01:41.220> the<00:01:41.340> different<00:01:41.610> things<00:01:41.790> that

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
patterns and the different things that

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.330 
patterns and the different things that
I've<00:01:42.090> made<00:01:42.270> over<00:01:42.570> here<00:01:42.600> these<00:01:43.350> to<00:01:43.710> use<00:01:43.979> 6

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:44.340 
I've made over here these to use 6

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.310 
I've made over here these to use 6
different<00:01:44.759> crafting<00:01:45.180> combinations<00:01:45.869> but<00:01:46.170> as

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
different crafting combinations but as

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.440 
different crafting combinations but as
long<00:01:46.530> as<00:01:46.560> you<00:01:47.220> put<00:01:47.430> 6<00:01:47.729> in<00:01:47.909> you<00:01:48.060> won't<00:01:48.149> be<00:01:48.329> able

00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:48.450 
long as you put 6 in you won't be able

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.210 
long as you put 6 in you won't be able
to<00:01:48.630> do<00:01:48.750> any<00:01:48.990> more<00:01:49.259> beyond<00:01:49.560> that<00:01:49.649> so<00:01:49.950> let's<00:01:50.100> have

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
to do any more beyond that so let's have

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:51.380 
to do any more beyond that so let's have
a<00:01:50.310> look<00:01:50.460> this<00:01:50.610> but<00:01:50.820> there<00:01:50.970> are<00:01:51.090> a<00:01:51.119> lot<00:01:51.240> of

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:51.390 
a look this but there are a lot of

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.420 
a look this but there are a lot of
combinations<00:01:52.079> you<00:01:52.229> can<00:01:52.380> use<00:01:52.619> to<00:01:52.860> craft<00:01:53.220> these

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
combinations you can use to craft these

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.069 
combinations you can use to craft these
flags<00:01:53.820> and<00:01:54.030> get<00:01:54.119> the<00:01:54.210> colors<00:01:54.479> onto<00:01:54.720> them

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
flags and get the colors onto them

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:56.690 
flags and get the colors onto them
however<00:01:55.530> one<00:01:55.950> thing<00:01:55.979> you<00:01:56.250> should<00:01:56.399> keep<00:01:56.430> in

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:56.700 
however one thing you should keep in

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:58.219 
however one thing you should keep in
mind<00:01:56.939> is<00:01:57.060> whatever<00:01:57.329> you<00:01:57.450> do<00:01:57.570> first<00:01:57.840> is<00:01:58.049> going

00:01:58.219 --> 00:01:58.229 
mind is whatever you do first is going

00:01:58.229 --> 00:01:59.569 
mind is whatever you do first is going
to<00:01:58.320> be<00:01:58.500> at<00:01:58.680> the<00:01:58.799> bottom<00:01:59.130> so<00:01:59.280> when<00:01:59.399> you<00:01:59.460> add

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
to be at the bottom so when you add

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.399 
to be at the bottom so when you add
something<00:01:59.610> that<00:01:59.969> overlaps<00:02:00.479> a<00:02:00.719> previous<00:02:01.140> color

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
something that overlaps a previous color

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.560 
something that overlaps a previous color
it<00:02:01.770> is<00:02:02.070> going<00:02:02.310> to<00:02:02.460> go<00:02:02.640> above<00:02:03.000> it<00:02:03.149> so<00:02:03.360> let's

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
it is going to go above it so let's

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.090 
it is going to go above it so let's
place<00:02:03.810> down<00:02:04.079> one<00:02:04.259> in<00:02:04.380> the<00:02:04.439> corner<00:02:04.649> this<00:02:04.829> is<00:02:04.890> the

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
place down one in the corner this is the

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.340 
place down one in the corner this is the
most<00:02:05.280> basic<00:02:05.460> you<00:02:05.820> can<00:02:05.909> put<00:02:06.090> these<00:02:06.210> in<00:02:06.450> each<00:02:07.140> of

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
most basic you can put these in each of

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.080 
most basic you can put these in each of
the<00:02:07.439> corners<00:02:07.590> like<00:02:08.009> so<00:02:08.340> and<00:02:08.550> then<00:02:08.940> that<00:02:09.060> just

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
the corners like so and then that just

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:10.820 
the corners like so and then that just
creates<00:02:09.539> a<00:02:09.690> color<00:02:09.899> in<00:02:10.140> the<00:02:10.259> corner<00:02:10.560> now<00:02:10.679> what

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:10.830 
creates a color in the corner now what

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:12.890 
creates a color in the corner now what
you<00:02:10.920> can<00:02:11.039> also<00:02:11.220> do<00:02:11.580> is<00:02:11.940> create<00:02:12.360> a<00:02:12.390> strip<00:02:12.870> down

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900 
you can also do is create a strip down

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.640 
you can also do is create a strip down
the<00:02:13.110> side

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
the side

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.619 
the side
like<00:02:13.739> so<00:02:14.040> you<00:02:14.099> can<00:02:14.189> also<00:02:14.459> put<00:02:14.849> that<00:02:14.879> in<00:02:15.360> the

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:15.629 
like so you can also put that in the

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:17.030 
like so you can also put that in the
middle<00:02:15.930> as<00:02:16.110> well<00:02:16.349> so<00:02:16.530> what<00:02:16.620> you're<00:02:16.739> basically

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:17.040 
middle as well so what you're basically

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.460 
middle as well so what you're basically
doing<00:02:17.189> is<00:02:17.579> arranging<00:02:18.269> with<00:02:18.750> the<00:02:18.930> dyes<00:02:19.140> where

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470 
doing is arranging with the dyes where

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:20.720 
doing is arranging with the dyes where
they're<00:02:19.620> going<00:02:19.769> to<00:02:19.890> appear<00:02:20.129> on<00:02:20.159> the<00:02:20.310> flag<00:02:20.519> and

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:20.730 
they're going to appear on the flag and

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.670 
they're going to appear on the flag and
then<00:02:20.819> you<00:02:20.939> can<00:02:21.090> drop<00:02:21.239> the<00:02:21.420> flag<00:02:21.659> in<00:02:21.959> anywhere

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:22.680 
then you can drop the flag in anywhere

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.679 
then you can drop the flag in anywhere
else<00:02:22.890> around<00:02:23.129> it<00:02:23.519> and<00:02:23.640> craft<00:02:24.000> it<00:02:24.180> like<00:02:24.329> so<00:02:24.569> now

00:02:24.679 --> 00:02:24.689 
else around it and craft it like so now

00:02:24.689 --> 00:02:26.839 
else around it and craft it like so now
that<00:02:24.840> also<00:02:24.989> goes<00:02:25.290> down<00:02:25.319> the<00:02:26.069> far<00:02:26.340> side<00:02:26.610> like

00:02:26.839 --> 00:02:26.849 
that also goes down the far side like

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:28.850 
that also goes down the far side like
that<00:02:26.879> this<00:02:27.299> works<00:02:27.629> across<00:02:28.049> the<00:02:28.170> bottom<00:02:28.500> and

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:28.860 
that this works across the bottom and

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.280 
that this works across the bottom and
again<00:02:29.670> it<00:02:30.000> goes<00:02:30.120> into<00:02:30.420> the<00:02:30.659> middle<00:02:30.930> and<00:02:31.109> also

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:31.290 
again it goes into the middle and also

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:33.080 
again it goes into the middle and also
at<00:02:31.620> the<00:02:31.769> top<00:02:31.980> as<00:02:32.220> well<00:02:32.250> so<00:02:32.459> you<00:02:32.700> can<00:02:32.790> craft

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
at the top as well so you can craft

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.270 
at the top as well so you can craft
across<00:02:33.930> like<00:02:34.379> so<00:02:34.709> now<00:02:34.890> there<00:02:35.069> are<00:02:35.099> some

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.280 
across like so now there are some

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.369 
across like so now there are some
special<00:02:35.340> combinations<00:02:36.269> as<00:02:36.840> well<00:02:37.109> for<00:02:37.290> example

00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:37.379 
special combinations as well for example

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:40.069 
special combinations as well for example
if<00:02:37.829> you<00:02:37.980> do<00:02:38.189> the<00:02:38.730> left<00:02:38.970> like<00:02:39.239> so<00:02:39.510> it's<00:02:39.720> going<00:02:39.959> to

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:40.079 
if you do the left like so it's going to

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:42.050 
if you do the left like so it's going to
cover<00:02:40.290> that<00:02:40.500> left<00:02:40.769> side<00:02:40.980> of<00:02:41.129> the<00:02:41.220> flag<00:02:41.459> however

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
cover that left side of the flag however

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.670 
cover that left side of the flag however
this<00:02:42.180> doesn't<00:02:42.420> work<00:02:42.750> when<00:02:43.019> it's<00:02:43.200> on<00:02:43.409> the<00:02:43.500> right

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:43.680 
this doesn't work when it's on the right

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.380 
this doesn't work when it's on the right
let's<00:02:43.890> just<00:02:44.129> arrange<00:02:44.519> that<00:02:44.730> quickly<00:02:45.000> you<00:02:45.239> can

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:45.390 
let's just arrange that quickly you can

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.690 
let's just arrange that quickly you can
see<00:02:45.599> it<00:02:46.049> doesn't<00:02:46.290> work<00:02:46.470> on<00:02:46.829> that<00:02:47.010> side<00:02:47.310> it<00:02:47.489> also

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:47.700 
see it doesn't work on that side it also

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:50.930 
see it doesn't work on that side it also
works<00:02:48.180> on<00:02:48.420> the<00:02:48.599> top<00:02:48.810> off<00:02:49.049> of<00:02:49.319> the<00:02:49.440> flag<00:02:49.650> like<00:02:50.459> so

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:50.940 
works on the top off of the flag like so

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.759 
works on the top off of the flag like so
and<00:02:51.209> there<00:02:51.540> are<00:02:51.690> a<00:02:51.720> few<00:02:51.810> other<00:02:52.109> combinations

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
and there are a few other combinations

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:55.460 
and there are a few other combinations
as<00:02:53.010> well<00:02:53.310> so<00:02:53.639> you<00:02:53.700> can<00:02:54.090> create<00:02:54.989> one<00:02:55.230> like<00:02:55.440> that

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
as well so you can create one like that

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:57.770 
as well so you can create one like that
that<00:02:55.889> creates<00:02:56.250> a<00:02:56.549> rhombus<00:02:57.180> shape<00:02:57.480> in<00:02:57.659> the

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
that creates a rhombus shape in the

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.660 
that creates a rhombus shape in the
middle<00:02:57.810> let's<00:02:58.170> do<00:02:58.379> that<00:02:58.500> with<00:02:58.709> a<00:02:58.950> more

00:02:59.660 --> 00:02:59.670 
middle let's do that with a more

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:01.309 
middle let's do that with a more
apparent<00:03:00.120> color<00:03:00.269> and<00:03:00.510> quickly<00:03:00.870> place<00:03:01.019> that

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:01.319 
apparent color and quickly place that

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:03.050 
apparent color and quickly place that
down<00:03:01.470> just<00:03:01.739> so<00:03:01.799> you<00:03:01.889> can<00:03:02.040> see<00:03:02.250> it<00:03:02.340> in<00:03:02.549> a<00:03:02.909> little

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:03.060 
down just so you can see it in a little

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.449 
down just so you can see it in a little
more<00:03:03.299> detail<00:03:03.659> now<00:03:04.409> if<00:03:04.530> you<00:03:04.620> put<00:03:04.799> a<00:03:04.829> single<00:03:05.129> die

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
more detail now if you put a single die

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:08.660 
more detail now if you put a single die
in<00:03:05.700> the<00:03:05.819> middle<00:03:05.939> it's<00:03:06.299> going<00:03:06.569> to<00:03:07.189> create<00:03:08.189> a<00:03:08.370> dot

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:08.670 
in the middle it's going to create a dot

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:10.670 
in the middle it's going to create a dot
in<00:03:08.970> the<00:03:09.090> very<00:03:09.269> middle<00:03:09.480> as<00:03:09.720> well<00:03:09.750> like<00:03:10.650> that

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:10.680 
in the very middle as well like that

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:13.610 
in the very middle as well like that
which<00:03:11.129> looks<00:03:11.340> really<00:03:11.579> cool<00:03:12.230> as<00:03:13.230> well<00:03:13.379> as<00:03:13.470> this

00:03:13.610 --> 00:03:13.620 
which looks really cool as well as this

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.710 
which looks really cool as well as this
you<00:03:13.799> can<00:03:13.950> also<00:03:14.129> do<00:03:14.489> a<00:03:14.519> cross<00:03:14.879> shape<00:03:15.150> so<00:03:15.450> you<00:03:15.480> can

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:15.720 
you can also do a cross shape so you can

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.960 
you can also do a cross shape so you can
put<00:03:15.900> them<00:03:16.109> like<00:03:16.829> so<00:03:17.159> and<00:03:17.400> then<00:03:17.669> you<00:03:17.790> get<00:03:17.940> a

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970 
put them like so and then you get a

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.930 
put them like so and then you get a
cross<00:03:18.299> going<00:03:18.720> on<00:03:19.680> the<00:03:19.859> flag<00:03:20.190> and<00:03:20.459> there<00:03:20.760> are<00:03:20.910> a

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
cross going on the flag and there are a

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:22.610 
cross going on the flag and there are a
bunch<00:03:21.180> of<00:03:21.329> special<00:03:21.750> ones<00:03:21.900> as<00:03:22.139> well<00:03:22.290> so<00:03:22.470> let's

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:22.620 
bunch of special ones as well so let's

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.289 
bunch of special ones as well so let's
go<00:03:22.739> through<00:03:23.280> those<00:03:23.459> quickly<00:03:23.669> you<00:03:23.940> can<00:03:24.060> put<00:03:24.209> in

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:24.299 
go through those quickly you can put in

00:03:24.299 --> 00:03:26.119 
go through those quickly you can put in
a<00:03:24.449> creeper<00:03:24.840> head<00:03:24.989> which<00:03:25.169> is<00:03:25.349> now<00:03:25.560> obtainable

00:03:26.119 --> 00:03:26.129 
a creeper head which is now obtainable

00:03:26.129 --> 00:03:28.129 
a creeper head which is now obtainable
in<00:03:26.489> survival<00:03:27.329> we<00:03:27.449> will<00:03:27.569> get<00:03:27.720> to<00:03:27.840> that<00:03:27.870> in<00:03:28.079> a

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:28.139 
in survival we will get to that in a

00:03:28.139 --> 00:03:30.470 
in survival we will get to that in a
moment<00:03:28.290> that<00:03:28.650> puts<00:03:28.889> the<00:03:29.040> creeper<00:03:29.370> face<00:03:29.609> on<00:03:29.879> the

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:30.480 
moment that puts the creeper face on the

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.750 
moment that puts the creeper face on the
flag<00:03:30.720> we<00:03:30.930> can<00:03:31.079> also<00:03:31.260> use<00:03:31.650> a<00:03:31.919> wither<00:03:32.159> skull<00:03:32.519> and

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:32.760 
flag we can also use a wither skull and

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.899 
flag we can also use a wither skull and
create<00:03:33.690> the<00:03:34.349> skull<00:03:34.859> and<00:03:35.159> crossbones<00:03:35.639> which

00:03:35.899 --> 00:03:35.909 
create the skull and crossbones which

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:38.089 
create the skull and crossbones which
you<00:03:36.060> saw<00:03:36.239> earlier<00:03:36.449> there's<00:03:37.079> also<00:03:37.349> the<00:03:37.620> oxide

00:03:38.089 --> 00:03:38.099 
you saw earlier there's also the oxide

00:03:38.099 --> 00:03:39.860 
you saw earlier there's also the oxide
Daisy<00:03:38.400> this<00:03:38.730> creates<00:03:39.090> something<00:03:39.449> I<00:03:39.540> haven't

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:39.870 
Daisy this creates something I haven't

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:41.899 
Daisy this creates something I haven't
actually<00:03:39.959> seen<00:03:40.169> yet<00:03:40.650> there<00:03:41.400> you<00:03:41.459> go<00:03:41.639> that<00:03:41.790> is<00:03:41.819> a

00:03:41.899 --> 00:03:41.909 
actually seen yet there you go that is a

00:03:41.909 --> 00:03:43.909 
actually seen yet there you go that is a
very<00:03:42.239> interesting<00:03:42.599> shape<00:03:43.049> in<00:03:43.319> the<00:03:43.889> middle

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:43.919 
very interesting shape in the middle

00:03:43.919 --> 00:03:46.309 
very interesting shape in the middle
right<00:03:44.340> there<00:03:44.639> and<00:03:44.819> now<00:03:45.659> we<00:03:45.720> don't<00:03:45.870> have<00:03:45.959> a<00:03:46.079> flag

00:03:46.309 --> 00:03:46.319 
right there and now we don't have a flag

00:03:46.319 --> 00:03:48.409 
right there and now we don't have a flag
let's<00:03:46.560> craft<00:03:46.799> another<00:03:47.159> one<00:03:47.370> because<00:03:48.120> there<00:03:48.299> is

00:03:48.409 --> 00:03:48.419 
let's craft another one because there is

00:03:48.419 --> 00:03:49.909 
let's craft another one because there is
one<00:03:48.690> more<00:03:48.900> recipe<00:03:49.319> I<00:03:49.349> haven't<00:03:49.620> shown<00:03:49.799> you<00:03:49.829> I

00:03:49.909 --> 00:03:49.919 
one more recipe I haven't shown you I

00:03:49.919 --> 00:03:52.309 
one more recipe I haven't shown you I
think<00:03:50.159> that<00:03:50.250> is<00:03:50.459> the<00:03:50.609> bricks<00:03:50.879> yes<00:03:51.840> if<00:03:52.079> you<00:03:52.199> put

00:03:52.309 --> 00:03:52.319 
think that is the bricks yes if you put

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:53.780 
think that is the bricks yes if you put
the<00:03:52.440> bricks<00:03:52.650> on<00:03:52.829> there<00:03:53.010> you'll<00:03:53.159> get<00:03:53.310> the<00:03:53.459> brick

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:53.790 
the bricks on there you'll get the brick

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:56.289 
the bricks on there you'll get the brick
texture<00:03:54.269> onto<00:03:54.510> your<00:03:55.019> flag

00:03:56.289 --> 00:03:56.299 
texture onto your flag

00:03:56.299 --> 00:03:58.759 
texture onto your flag
so<00:03:57.299> I've<00:03:57.419> discovered<00:03:57.780> a<00:03:58.049> couple<00:03:58.260> more<00:03:58.620> that<00:03:58.709> I

00:03:58.759 --> 00:03:58.769 
so I've discovered a couple more that I

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:00.170 
so I've discovered a couple more that I
want<00:03:58.949> to<00:03:59.040> show<00:03:59.250> you<00:03:59.310> quickly<00:03:59.579> you<00:03:59.909> can<00:04:00.060> put

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
want to show you quickly you can put

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:01.909 
want to show you quickly you can put
free<00:04:00.389> dyes<00:04:00.599> in<00:04:00.870> the<00:04:00.989> top-left<00:04:01.229> corner<00:04:01.590> like

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:01.919 
free dyes in the top-left corner like

00:04:01.919 --> 00:04:03.530 
free dyes in the top-left corner like
that<00:04:01.949> or<00:04:02.310> in<00:04:02.400> the<00:04:02.489> top-right<00:04:02.760> corner<00:04:03.060> but

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:03.540 
that or in the top-right corner but

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:05.869 
that or in the top-right corner but
these<00:04:03.690> do<00:04:03.900> not<00:04:03.930> work<00:04:04.109> in<00:04:04.889> the<00:04:05.129> bottom<00:04:05.489> corners

00:04:05.869 --> 00:04:05.879 
these do not work in the bottom corners

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:08.390 
these do not work in the bottom corners
you<00:04:06.030> can<00:04:06.180> also<00:04:06.389> create<00:04:06.870> a<00:04:07.290> triangle<00:04:08.010> shape

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:08.400 
you can also create a triangle shape

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:10.640 
you can also create a triangle shape
using<00:04:08.790> that<00:04:08.970> and<00:04:09.209> you<00:04:09.930> can<00:04:10.079> do<00:04:10.199> this<00:04:10.319> at<00:04:10.530> the

00:04:10.640 --> 00:04:10.650 
using that and you can do this at the

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.050 
using that and you can do this at the
bottom<00:04:10.919> as<00:04:11.040> well<00:04:11.159> so<00:04:11.370> if<00:04:11.430> you<00:04:11.489> put<00:04:11.639> the<00:04:11.729> dies<00:04:11.879> at

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060 
bottom as well so if you put the dies at

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:13.430 
bottom as well so if you put the dies at
the<00:04:12.150> bottom<00:04:12.449> then<00:04:12.629> you<00:04:12.720> get<00:04:12.840> the<00:04:12.930> triangle<00:04:13.290> at

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:13.440 
the bottom then you get the triangle at

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:14.990 
the bottom then you get the triangle at
the<00:04:13.470> bottom<00:04:13.769> but<00:04:13.919> it<00:04:14.010> doesn't<00:04:14.280> work<00:04:14.430> when

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
the bottom but it doesn't work when

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.689 
the bottom but it doesn't work when
they're<00:04:15.209> on<00:04:15.299> the<00:04:15.419> side<00:04:16.280> there<00:04:17.280> have<00:04:17.400> been<00:04:17.459> some

00:04:17.689 --> 00:04:17.699 
they're on the side there have been some

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:19.460 
they're on the side there have been some
more<00:04:17.880> changes<00:04:18.359> to<00:04:18.389> the<00:04:18.690> player<00:04:18.959> skulls<00:04:19.320> you

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:19.470 
more changes to the player skulls you

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:21.439 
more changes to the player skulls you
can<00:04:19.650> see<00:04:19.829> I<00:04:19.859> am<00:04:20.130> holding<00:04:20.400> a<00:04:20.669> Steve's<00:04:21.030> go<00:04:21.239> in<00:04:21.359> my

00:04:21.439 --> 00:04:21.449 
can see I am holding a Steve's go in my

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:22.790 
can see I am holding a Steve's go in my
hand<00:04:21.630> right<00:04:21.779> now<00:04:21.810> that<00:04:22.079> is<00:04:22.169> actually<00:04:22.500> supposed

00:04:22.790 --> 00:04:22.800 
hand right now that is actually supposed

hand right now that is actually supposed
to<00:04:22.950> be<00:04:23.010> my<00:04:23.250> own<00:04:23.430> skin<00:04:23.760> but<00:04:23.909> for<00:04:23.969> some<00:04:24.270> reason

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:24.570 
to be my own skin but for some reason

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:25.940 
to be my own skin but for some reason
it's<00:04:25.020> not<00:04:25.169> working<00:04:25.349> at<00:04:25.800> the<00:04:25.830> moment

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:25.950 
it's not working at the moment

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:27.530 
it's not working at the moment
dinnerbone<00:04:26.610> did<00:04:26.849> tweet<00:04:27.090> out<00:04:27.270> of

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.540 
dinnerbone did tweet out of

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:29.180 
dinnerbone did tweet out of
where<00:04:27.900> he's<00:04:28.050> holding<00:04:28.320> one<00:04:28.380> in<00:04:28.620> his<00:04:28.740> hand<00:04:28.950> and

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:29.190 
where he's holding one in his hand and

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.340 
where he's holding one in his hand and
it<00:04:29.760> rendered<00:04:30.180> the<00:04:30.360> skin<00:04:30.720> but<00:04:30.840> another<00:04:31.080> change

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:31.350 
it rendered the skin but another change

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:32.960 
it rendered the skin but another change
has<00:04:31.530> been<00:04:31.680> made<00:04:31.980> to<00:04:32.220> these<00:04:32.490> when<00:04:32.670> you<00:04:32.760> place

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:32.970 
has been made to these when you place

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:34.970 
has been made to these when you place
them<00:04:33.180> down<00:04:33.360> on<00:04:33.480> the<00:04:33.570> ground<00:04:33.600> it<00:04:34.290> now<00:04:34.470> displays

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:34.980 
them down on the ground it now displays

00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:36.410 
them down on the ground it now displays
the<00:04:35.010> hat<00:04:35.430> layer<00:04:35.640> so<00:04:35.850> you<00:04:35.880> can<00:04:36.060> see<00:04:36.180> I've<00:04:36.270> got<00:04:36.360> a

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:36.420 
the hat layer so you can see I've got a

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:38.120 
the hat layer so you can see I've got a
little<00:04:36.630> bit<00:04:36.870> of<00:04:36.960> that<00:04:37.080> just<00:04:37.560> at<00:04:37.800> the<00:04:37.890> front

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:38.130 
little bit of that just at the front

00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:39.500 
little bit of that just at the front
there<00:04:38.280> and<00:04:38.310> that<00:04:38.580> renders<00:04:38.970> on<00:04:39.180> the<00:04:39.300> player

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:39.510 
there and that renders on the player

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:41.840 
there and that renders on the player
skull<00:04:39.870> as<00:04:40.050> well<00:04:40.650> now<00:04:40.860> I<00:04:40.890> mentioned<00:04:41.370> earlier<00:04:41.730> in

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:41.850 
skull as well now I mentioned earlier in

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:43.100 
skull as well now I mentioned earlier in
this<00:04:41.970> video<00:04:42.270> that<00:04:42.450> you<00:04:42.510> can<00:04:42.540> actually<00:04:42.750> get

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:43.110 
this video that you can actually get

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:45.350 
this video that you can actually get
these<00:04:43.260> skulls<00:04:43.650> in<00:04:43.860> survival<00:04:44.400> the<00:04:44.880> way<00:04:45.030> to<00:04:45.090> do

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.360 
these skulls in survival the way to do

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.390 
these skulls in survival the way to do
that<00:04:45.540> is<00:04:45.750> with<00:04:46.020> a<00:04:46.050> charged<00:04:46.680> creeper<00:04:46.980> which

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:47.400 
that is with a charged creeper which

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.300 
that is with a charged creeper which
creates<00:04:47.760> a<00:04:47.820> very<00:04:47.970> challenging<00:04:48.930> challenge<00:04:49.770> if

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:50.310 
creates a very challenging challenge if

00:04:50.310 --> 00:04:52.010 
creates a very challenging challenge if
ever<00:04:50.610> there<00:04:50.730> was<00:04:50.850> one<00:04:51.090> so<00:04:51.300> let's<00:04:51.450> summon<00:04:51.690> in<00:04:51.900> a

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:52.020 
ever there was one so let's summon in a

ever there was one so let's summon in a
creeper<00:04:52.380> right<00:04:52.410> here<00:04:52.770> and<00:04:52.950> let's<00:04:53.100> blow<00:04:53.310> this

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:53.460 
creeper right here and let's blow this

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:55.640 
creeper right here and let's blow this
guy<00:04:53.700> up<00:04:53.940> he's<00:04:54.630> going<00:04:54.870> to<00:04:54.990> kill<00:04:55.170> the<00:04:55.200> other<00:04:55.320> guys

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:55.650 
guy up he's going to kill the other guys

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:57.290 
guy up he's going to kill the other guys
in<00:04:55.890> there<00:04:56.100> and<00:04:56.280> they<00:04:56.370> are<00:04:56.400> all<00:04:56.520> going<00:04:56.910> to<00:04:57.000> drop

00:04:57.290 --> 00:04:57.300 
in there and they are all going to drop

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.810 
in there and they are all going to drop
their<00:04:57.840> skulls<00:04:58.260> so<00:04:58.500> you<00:04:58.560> can<00:04:58.800> see<00:04:59.070> we've<00:04:59.610> got

00:04:59.810 --> 00:04:59.820 
their skulls so you can see we've got

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:02.270 
their skulls so you can see we've got
the<00:04:59.970> zombie<00:05:00.270> skull<00:05:00.570> the<00:05:01.290> creeper<00:05:01.740> skull<00:05:02.040> and

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:02.280 
the zombie skull the creeper skull and

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:03.860 
the zombie skull the creeper skull and
somewhere<00:05:02.670> in<00:05:02.790> here<00:05:02.820> there<00:05:03.180> is<00:05:03.360> is<00:05:03.660> the

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:03.870 
somewhere in here there is is the

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:08.330 
somewhere in here there is is the
skeleton<00:05:04.380> skull<00:05:06.170> so<00:05:07.170> the<00:05:07.350> next<00:05:07.560> big<00:05:07.710> change<00:05:07.980> is

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:08.340 
skeleton skull so the next big change is

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:10.490 
skeleton skull so the next big change is
with<00:05:08.550> the<00:05:08.670> optimization<00:05:09.510> and<00:05:09.720> performance<00:05:10.290> of

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:10.500 
with the optimization and performance of

00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:12.740 
with the optimization and performance of
the<00:05:10.680> game<00:05:10.920> these<00:05:11.490> changes<00:05:12.000> are<00:05:12.210> really<00:05:12.510> big

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:12.750 
the game these changes are really big

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:14.090 
the game these changes are really big
but<00:05:12.780> one<00:05:13.050> thing<00:05:13.260> to<00:05:13.350> keep<00:05:13.470> in<00:05:13.620> mind<00:05:13.680> is<00:05:13.980> they

00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:14.100 
but one thing to keep in mind is they

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:16.010 
but one thing to keep in mind is they
won't<00:05:14.310> affect<00:05:14.610> everyone<00:05:15.060> it<00:05:15.180> does<00:05:15.330> depend<00:05:15.750> on

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:16.020 
won't affect everyone it does depend on

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:17.480 
won't affect everyone it does depend on
your<00:05:16.470> computer<00:05:16.890> but<00:05:17.010> here's<00:05:17.190> the<00:05:17.310> big<00:05:17.460> thing

00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:17.490 
your computer but here's the big thing

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:19.670 
your computer but here's the big thing
let's<00:05:17.820> press<00:05:18.090> f3<00:05:18.360> one<00:05:19.140> of<00:05:19.200> the<00:05:19.290> things<00:05:19.440> you<00:05:19.560> can

00:05:19.670 --> 00:05:19.680 
let's press f3 one of the things you can

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.290 
let's press f3 one of the things you can
see<00:05:19.710> there<00:05:20.040> it<00:05:20.100> now<00:05:20.220> shows<00:05:20.520> you<00:05:20.700> the<00:05:20.760> graphics

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:21.300 
see there it now shows you the graphics

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:23.240 
see there it now shows you the graphics
card<00:05:21.540> that<00:05:21.690> you<00:05:21.750> have<00:05:21.810> on<00:05:22.170> the<00:05:22.320> side<00:05:22.590> but<00:05:23.100> let's

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:23.250 
card that you have on the side but let's

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:25.850 
card that you have on the side but let's
have<00:05:23.400> a<00:05:23.490> look<00:05:23.760> at<00:05:23.940> the<00:05:24.150> FPS<00:05:24.660> we've<00:05:24.870> got<00:05:24.960> 105<00:05:25.680> at

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:25.860 
have a look at the FPS we've got 105 at

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:27.290 
have a look at the FPS we've got 105 at
the<00:05:25.980> moment<00:05:26.280> which<00:05:26.370> is<00:05:26.400> pretty<00:05:26.700> impressive<00:05:26.910> on

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:27.300 
the moment which is pretty impressive on

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:29.630 
the moment which is pretty impressive on
a<00:05:27.330> world<00:05:27.690> like<00:05:27.930> this<00:05:27.960> but<00:05:28.710> if<00:05:28.770> we<00:05:28.920> drop<00:05:29.190> down<00:05:29.220> to

00:05:29.630 --> 00:05:29.640 
a world like this but if we drop down to

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:31.220 
a world like this but if we drop down to
the<00:05:29.790> ground<00:05:29.820> and<00:05:30.330> just<00:05:30.570> look<00:05:30.780> directly<00:05:30.930> down

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:31.230 
the ground and just look directly down

00:05:31.230 --> 00:05:33.530 
the ground and just look directly down
you<00:05:31.590> can<00:05:31.710> see<00:05:31.890> my<00:05:32.040> FPS<00:05:32.520> goes<00:05:33.120> all<00:05:33.270> the<00:05:33.300> way<00:05:33.390> up

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:33.540 
you can see my FPS goes all the way up

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:35.510 
you can see my FPS goes all the way up
to<00:05:33.750> around<00:05:34.020> 500<00:05:34.290> and<00:05:34.800> this<00:05:34.920> is<00:05:35.100> because<00:05:35.370> the

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:35.520 
to around 500 and this is because the

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:37.610 
to around 500 and this is because the
game<00:05:35.640> isn't<00:05:36.360> rendering<00:05:36.780> and<00:05:36.960> loading<00:05:37.380> things

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:37.620 
game isn't rendering and loading things

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:39.020 
game isn't rendering and loading things
that<00:05:37.770> we<00:05:37.830> can't<00:05:38.040> see<00:05:38.310> so<00:05:38.520> if<00:05:38.580> we<00:05:38.730> turn<00:05:38.910> around

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:39.030 
that we can't see so if we turn around

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:40.670 
that we can't see so if we turn around
really<00:05:39.390> quickly<00:05:39.720> which<00:05:39.990> we<00:05:40.110> can<00:05:40.260> kind<00:05:40.470> of<00:05:40.530> do

00:05:40.670 --> 00:05:40.680 
really quickly which we can kind of do

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:42.860 
really quickly which we can kind of do
with<00:05:40.800> f5<00:05:41.010> like<00:05:41.910> that<00:05:42.150> you<00:05:42.300> can<00:05:42.480> see<00:05:42.720> that

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:42.870 
with f5 like that you can see that

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:44.990 
with f5 like that you can see that
nothing<00:05:43.170> was<00:05:43.380> loaded<00:05:43.920> behind<00:05:44.190> us<00:05:44.370> until<00:05:44.790> I

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:45.000 
nothing was loaded behind us until I

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.970 
nothing was loaded behind us until I
moved<00:05:45.690> for<00:05:45.870> a<00:05:45.930> second<00:05:46.320> there<00:05:46.470> so<00:05:46.620> that's<00:05:46.770> going

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:46.980 
moved for a second there so that's going

00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:48.890 
moved for a second there so that's going
to<00:05:47.130> just<00:05:47.280> increase<00:05:47.640> the<00:05:47.940> general<00:05:48.390> performance

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:48.900 
to just increase the general performance

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:50.840 
to just increase the general performance
of<00:05:49.350> the<00:05:49.440> game<00:05:49.620> as<00:05:49.860> you're<00:05:50.010> using<00:05:50.190> it<00:05:50.430> now<00:05:50.610> I've

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:50.850 
of the game as you're using it now I've

00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:52.580 
of the game as you're using it now I've
read<00:05:51.150> that<00:05:51.360> you<00:05:51.450> can<00:05:51.600> also<00:05:51.780> turn<00:05:52.110> the<00:05:52.320> view

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:52.590 
read that you can also turn the view

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:54.920 
read that you can also turn the view
distance<00:05:52.980> up<00:05:53.190> to<00:05:53.220> so<00:05:53.820> Jeb<00:05:54.090> also<00:05:54.450> tweeted<00:05:54.840> out

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:54.930 
distance up to so Jeb also tweeted out

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:56.570 
distance up to so Jeb also tweeted out
you<00:05:55.110> could<00:05:55.290> change<00:05:55.500> your<00:05:55.590> render<00:05:56.010> distance<00:05:56.370> up

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:56.580 
you could change your render distance up

00:05:56.580 --> 00:05:58.760 
you could change your render distance up
to<00:05:56.790> 32<00:05:57.330> chunks<00:05:57.720> at<00:05:57.840> the<00:05:57.930> moment<00:05:58.230> I'm<00:05:58.350> limited

00:05:58.760 --> 00:05:58.770 
to 32 chunks at the moment I'm limited

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:00.770 
to 32 chunks at the moment I'm limited
to<00:05:58.890> 16<00:05:59.340> us<00:05:59.490> I<00:05:59.610> can't<00:05:59.820> seem<00:06:00.000> to<00:06:00.030> go<00:06:00.270> above<00:06:00.600> that

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:00.780 
to 16 us I can't seem to go above that

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:02.690 
to 16 us I can't seem to go above that
but<00:06:01.440> the<00:06:01.560> game<00:06:01.710> is<00:06:01.890> certainly<00:06:02.070> performing

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:02.700 
but the game is certainly performing

00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:04.340 
but the game is certainly performing
better<00:06:02.880> and<00:06:03.120> so<00:06:03.210> that<00:06:03.360> will<00:06:03.450> probably<00:06:03.600> be<00:06:03.960> an

00:06:04.340 --> 00:06:04.350 
better and so that will probably be an

00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:05.990 
better and so that will probably be an
option<00:06:04.830> in<00:06:05.010> the<00:06:05.100> future<00:06:05.250> but<00:06:05.550> one<00:06:05.670> thing<00:06:05.850> to

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:06.000 
option in the future but one thing to

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.850 
option in the future but one thing to
note<00:06:06.180> is<00:06:06.300> this<00:06:06.450> alternative<00:06:07.080> blocks<00:06:07.440> down<00:06:07.710> the

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:07.860 
note is this alternative blocks down the

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:09.650 
note is this alternative blocks down the
bottom<00:06:08.190> here<00:06:08.220> you<00:06:08.790> can<00:06:08.940> see<00:06:09.060> that's<00:06:09.240> on<00:06:09.450> at<00:06:09.570> the

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:09.660 
bottom here you can see that's on at the

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:10.760 
bottom here you can see that's on at the
moment<00:06:09.960> if<00:06:10.050> we<00:06:10.170> just<00:06:10.350> go<00:06:10.500> and<00:06:10.590> pay<00:06:10.710> attention

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:10.770 
moment if we just go and pay attention

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:13.250 
moment if we just go and pay attention
to<00:06:11.280> the<00:06:11.430> grass<00:06:11.670> on<00:06:11.970> the<00:06:12.000> outside<00:06:12.450> here<00:06:12.720> you<00:06:13.110> can

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:13.260 
to the grass on the outside here you can

00:06:13.260 --> 00:06:15.260 
to the grass on the outside here you can
see<00:06:13.380> that<00:06:13.560> the<00:06:13.710> texture<00:06:14.070> is<00:06:14.280> randomly<00:06:14.670> rotated

00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:15.270 
see that the texture is randomly rotated

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:16.820 
see that the texture is randomly rotated
for<00:06:15.420> each<00:06:15.540> block<00:06:15.900> which<00:06:16.410> I<00:06:16.560> thought<00:06:16.710> was

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:16.830 
for each block which I thought was

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:18.530 
for each block which I thought was
something<00:06:17.070> there<00:06:17.370> permanently<00:06:17.640> implemented

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:18.540 
something there permanently implemented

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:19.850 
something there permanently implemented
but<00:06:18.750> it's<00:06:18.840> actually<00:06:19.200> something<00:06:19.440> you<00:06:19.710> can

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:19.860 
but it's actually something you can

00:06:19.860 --> 00:06:21.710 
but it's actually something you can
change<00:06:20.100> here<00:06:20.340> so<00:06:20.460> we<00:06:20.550> can<00:06:20.670> turn<00:06:20.850> that<00:06:20.970> off<00:06:21.030> the

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:21.720 
change here so we can turn that off the

00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:23.450 
change here so we can turn that off the
game<00:06:21.930> will<00:06:22.110> then<00:06:22.260> rerender<00:06:22.740> when<00:06:22.890> we<00:06:23.010> move<00:06:23.220> and

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:23.460 
game will then rerender when we move and

00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:25.490 
game will then rerender when we move and
it<00:06:24.120> rendered<00:06:24.420> very<00:06:24.600> fast<00:06:24.990> and<00:06:25.200> you<00:06:25.230> see<00:06:25.410> all

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:25.500 
it rendered very fast and you see all

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:27.200 
it rendered very fast and you see all
the<00:06:25.590> grass<00:06:25.770> is<00:06:26.070> in<00:06:26.100> the<00:06:26.490> same<00:06:26.730> direction<00:06:26.850> now

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:27.210 
the grass is in the same direction now

00:06:27.210 --> 00:06:28.880 
the grass is in the same direction now
but<00:06:27.360> that<00:06:27.450> is<00:06:27.540> something<00:06:27.750> else<00:06:27.960> to<00:06:28.590> show<00:06:28.830> you

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:28.890 
but that is something else to show you

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:30.980 
but that is something else to show you
the<00:06:29.160> reloading<00:06:29.550> of<00:06:29.790> the<00:06:29.970> world<00:06:30.210> has<00:06:30.690> been

the reloading of the world has been

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:33.260 
the reloading of the world has been
greatly<00:06:31.350> improved<00:06:31.530> let's<00:06:32.100> press<00:06:32.370> f3<00:06:32.640> and<00:06:33.090> a

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:33.270 
greatly improved let's press f3 and a

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:35.940 
and that is absolutely magic can you

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:38.240 
and that is absolutely magic can you
believe<00:06:36.300> how<00:06:36.900> fast<00:06:37.260> that<00:06:37.500> is<00:06:37.710> loading<00:06:38.070> let's

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:38.250 
believe how fast that is loading let's

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:39.950 
believe how fast that is loading let's
just<00:06:38.430> do<00:06:38.520> that<00:06:38.580> one<00:06:38.820> more<00:06:38.940> time<00:06:39.000> that<00:06:39.900> is

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:39.960 
just do that one more time that is

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:41.420 
just do that one more time that is
absolutely<00:06:40.590> ridiculous

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:41.430 
absolutely ridiculous

00:06:41.430 --> 00:06:43.760 
absolutely ridiculous
fast<00:06:41.790> that<00:06:42.060> loads<00:06:42.270> a<00:06:42.450> huge<00:06:42.840> improvement<00:06:43.590> over

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:43.770 
fast that loads a huge improvement over

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:47.090 
fast that loads a huge improvement over
the<00:06:44.340> previous<00:06:44.460> snapshot<00:06:45.710> and<00:06:46.710> there<00:06:46.950> is<00:06:47.070> a

00:07:03.470 --> 00:07:03.480 
useful with the creepers as well if you

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:05.810 
useful with the creepers as well if you
want<00:07:03.660> to<00:07:03.780> turn<00:07:03.990> them<00:07:04.200> into<00:07:04.440> charged<00:07:05.430> creepers

there's<00:07:06.030> also<00:07:06.240> a<00:07:06.390> couple<00:07:06.660> of<00:07:06.990> other<00:07:07.170> little

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:07.290 
there's also a couple of other little
