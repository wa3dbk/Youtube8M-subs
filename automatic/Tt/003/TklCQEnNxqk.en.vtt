00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479 
matters is the content the music itself

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:42.130 
matters is the content the music itself
and<00:01:38.689> the<00:01:38.750> quality<00:01:38.960> of<00:01:39.640> my<00:01:40.640> work<00:01:40.900> career<00:01:41.900> in

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450

mortal mortal Symphony and the chairman

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.640 
mortal mortal Symphony and the chairman
of<00:02:04.220> the<00:02:04.369> jury<00:02:04.579> asked<00:02:05.479> what<00:02:05.630> my<00:02:05.780> name<00:02:05.840> was<00:02:06.049> but<00:02:06.619> I

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:06.650 
of the jury asked what my name was but I

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:08.319 
of the jury asked what my name was but I
couldn't<00:02:07.040> hear<00:02:07.220> him<00:02:07.400> very<00:02:07.610> well<00:02:07.670> because<00:02:08.000> it

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:08.329 
couldn't hear him very well because it

00:02:08.329 --> 00:02:10.389 
couldn't hear him very well because it
was<00:02:08.450> a<00:02:08.509> very<00:02:08.629> noisy<00:02:08.869> echoey<00:02:09.379> room<00:02:09.709> so<00:02:10.369> I

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399 
was a very noisy echoey room so I

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:11.800 
was a very noisy echoey room so I
thought<00:02:10.579> he<00:02:10.729> was<00:02:10.819> asking<00:02:11.180> what<00:02:11.329> piece<00:02:11.540> I<00:02:11.659> was

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:11.810 
thought he was asking what piece I was

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:15.940 
thought he was asking what piece I was
conducting<00:02:12.019> Isaac<00:02:12.650> Isaac<00:02:13.459> Mozart<00:02:13.939> and<00:02:14.739> is<00:02:15.739> it

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
conducting Isaac Isaac Mozart and is it

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:17.890 
conducting Isaac Isaac Mozart and is it
really

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
really

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.539 
really
he<00:02:18.409> felt<00:02:18.620> that<00:02:18.739> the<00:02:18.829> boy<00:02:18.950> had<00:02:18.980> a<00:02:19.340> lot<00:02:19.519> of

00:02:19.539 --> 00:02:19.549 
he felt that the boy had a lot of

00:02:19.549 --> 00:02:21.429 
he felt that the boy had a lot of
self-confidence<00:02:19.939> so<00:02:20.720> it<00:02:20.780> was<00:02:20.900> a<00:02:20.930> somewhat

00:02:21.429 --> 00:02:21.439 
self-confidence so it was a somewhat

00:02:21.439 --> 00:02:23.500 
self-confidence so it was a somewhat
unfortunate<00:02:21.760> start<00:02:22.760> because<00:02:23.000> the<00:02:23.090> orcas<00:02:23.329> are

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:23.510 
unfortunate start because the orcas are

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.300 
unfortunate start because the orcas are
laughing<00:02:23.930> of<00:02:24.019> course<00:02:24.049> there's<00:02:25.040> a<00:02:25.129> guy<00:02:25.250> who

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
laughing of course there's a guy who

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.309 
laughing of course there's a guy who
thinks<00:02:25.489> he's<00:02:25.670> mortared<00:02:26.060> so<00:02:26.959> that<00:02:27.110> was<00:02:27.230> the

00:02:27.309 --> 00:02:27.319 
thinks he's mortared so that was the

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:29.979 
thinks he's mortared so that was the
first<00:02:27.500> time<00:02:27.620> I<00:02:27.769> never<00:02:27.980> forget<00:02:28.250> it<00:02:28.540> in<00:02:29.540> the<00:02:29.750> best

00:02:29.979 --> 00:02:29.989 
first time I never forget it in the best

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:33.520 
first time I never forget it in the best
performances<00:02:30.620> what<00:02:31.250> happens<00:02:31.579> is<00:02:31.730> I<00:02:31.970> feel<00:02:32.569> that

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:33.530 
performances what happens is I feel that

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.089 
performances what happens is I feel that
there's<00:02:33.829> no<00:02:33.920> need<00:02:34.459> to<00:02:34.790> translate<00:02:35.239> between<00:02:36.230> my

00:02:37.089 --> 00:02:37.099 
there's no need to translate between my

00:02:37.099 --> 00:02:38.589 
there's no need to translate between my
thoughts<00:02:37.400> and<00:02:37.640> the<00:02:37.700> music<00:02:38.030> and<00:02:38.180> vice<00:02:38.329> versa

00:02:38.589 --> 00:02:38.599 
thoughts and the music and vice versa

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:40.149 
thoughts and the music and vice versa
the<00:02:38.840> music<00:02:39.170> and<00:02:39.260> my<00:02:39.379> thoughts<00:02:39.620> are<00:02:39.829> the<00:02:39.980> same

00:02:40.149 --> 00:02:40.159 
the music and my thoughts are the same

00:02:40.159 --> 00:02:42.520 
the music and my thoughts are the same
thing<00:02:40.370> of<00:02:41.090> course<00:02:41.390> I<00:02:41.480> kind<00:02:41.900> of<00:02:41.989> describe<00:02:42.379> it

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.530 
thing of course I kind of describe it

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:45.009 
thing of course I kind of describe it
because<00:02:43.250> then<00:02:43.579> there<00:02:43.909> are<00:02:44.060> words<00:02:44.239> it's<00:02:44.900> a

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:45.019 
because then there are words it's a

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:47.500 
because then there are words it's a
wordless<00:02:45.470> way<00:02:45.950> of<00:02:46.099> thinking<00:02:46.459> and<00:02:46.549> and<00:02:46.819> that's

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510 
wordless way of thinking and and that's

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:50.170 
wordless way of thinking and and that's
why<00:02:47.720> using<00:02:48.109> such<00:02:48.439> a<00:02:48.470> mystery<00:02:48.859> and<00:02:49.099> that's<00:02:49.970> why

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:50.180 
why using such a mystery and that's why

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.180 
why using such a mystery and that's why
it's<00:02:50.329> so<00:02:50.420> frustrating<00:02:50.900> to<00:02:51.409> speak<00:02:51.650> about<00:02:51.829> music

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:52.190 
it's so frustrating to speak about music

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.420 
it's so frustrating to speak about music
because<00:02:52.489> when<00:02:52.670> it<00:02:53.480> really<00:02:53.959> happens<00:02:54.250> we<00:02:55.250> all

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
because when it really happens we all

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:56.680 
because when it really happens we all
feel<00:02:55.760> whether<00:02:56.000> you're<00:02:56.180> performing<00:02:56.420> or

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:56.690 
feel whether you're performing or

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:58.899 
feel whether you're performing or
whether<00:02:56.810> you're<00:02:56.900> listening<00:02:57.379> that<00:02:57.909> something

00:02:58.899 --> 00:02:58.909 
whether you're listening that something

00:02:58.909 --> 00:03:00.819 
whether you're listening that something
extraordinary<00:02:59.209> is<00:02:59.629> happening<00:02:59.690> that<00:03:00.230> touches

00:03:00.819 --> 00:03:00.829 
extraordinary is happening that touches

00:03:00.829 --> 00:03:04.780 
extraordinary is happening that touches
us<00:03:00.980> in<00:03:01.700> a<00:03:02.120> way<00:03:02.150> that<00:03:02.599> words<00:03:02.870> don't<00:03:03.290> ever<00:03:03.739> do<00:03:04.430> in

us in a way that words don't ever do in
a<00:03:05.629> way<00:03:05.780> that<00:03:05.959> images<00:03:06.439> never<00:03:06.980> do<00:03:07.220> in<00:03:07.489> a<00:03:07.579> way<00:03:07.730> that

a way that images never do in a way that

nothing else can duck can do except

00:03:09.829 --> 00:03:12.399 
nothing else can duck can do except
music<00:03:10.220> because<00:03:10.579> it<00:03:10.730> somehow<00:03:11.260> connects<00:03:12.260> with

00:03:12.399 --> 00:03:12.409 
music because it somehow connects with

music because it somehow connects with

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:17.840 
Stravinsky and that's what it comes down

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:21.070 
Stravinsky and that's what it comes down
to<00:05:18.140> really<00:05:18.890> the<00:05:19.160> quality<00:05:19.790> of<00:05:19.820> the<00:05:19.970> idea<00:05:20.330> the

imagination the technique everybody can
learn<00:05:23.960> ultimately<00:05:24.920> to<00:05:25.640> make<00:05:25.820> something<00:05:26.600> that

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:26.750 
learn ultimately to make something that

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:30.490 
learn ultimately to make something that
looks<00:05:27.040> or<00:05:28.040> sounds<00:05:28.430> like<00:05:28.790> a<00:05:28.820> work<00:05:29.090> of<00:05:29.210> art<00:05:29.500> but

00:05:30.490 --> 00:05:30.500 
looks or sounds like a work of art but

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:32.740 
looks or sounds like a work of art but
the<00:05:30.530> the<00:05:31.280> quality<00:05:31.580> of<00:05:31.610> the<00:05:31.760> idea<00:05:32.060> itself<00:05:32.510> is

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:32.750 
the the quality of the idea itself is

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:34.540 
the the quality of the idea itself is
the<00:05:33.380> very<00:05:33.620> central<00:05:33.950> issue<00:05:34.100> here<00:05:34.340> and

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:34.550 
the very central issue here and

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:37.330 
the very central issue here and
Stravinsky<00:05:35.120> never<00:05:35.810> had<00:05:35.960> bad<00:05:36.140> ideas<00:05:36.560> and<00:05:36.770> he

tonight<00:06:25.160> I<00:06:25.430> think<00:06:26.150> it's<00:06:26.300> it's<00:06:26.570> kind<00:06:26.810> of<00:06:26.870> rare

00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:27.370 
tonight I think it's it's kind of rare

00:06:27.370 --> 00:06:29.710 
tonight I think it's it's kind of rare
again<00:06:28.370> this<00:06:28.640> idea<00:06:28.850> of<00:06:29.120> being<00:06:29.270> a<00:06:29.360> part<00:06:29.540> of<00:06:29.630> a

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:29.720 
again this idea of being a part of a

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:32.500 
again this idea of being a part of a
group<00:06:29.930> that<00:06:30.140> practices<00:06:30.830> and<00:06:31.330> rehearses<00:06:32.330> in

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:32.510 
group that practices and rehearses in

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:34.090 
group that practices and rehearses in
and<00:06:32.690> finally<00:06:33.320> there<00:06:33.470> is<00:06:33.500> the<00:06:33.590> concert<00:06:33.980> that

00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:34.100 
and finally there is the concert that

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:35.260 
and finally there is the concert that
then<00:06:34.250> you<00:06:34.370> feel<00:06:34.580> like<00:06:34.610> you<00:06:34.910> have<00:06:35.000> achieved

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:35.270 
then you feel like you have achieved

00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:38.890 
then you feel like you have achieved
something<00:06:35.720> that<00:06:36.500> has<00:06:36.830> some<00:06:37.310> meaning<00:06:37.780> what<00:06:38.780> the

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:38.900 
something that has some meaning what the

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:41.200 
something that has some meaning what the
audience<00:06:38.960> cannot<00:06:39.530> see<00:06:39.830> is<00:06:40.070> what<00:06:40.370> goes<00:06:41.030> on

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:41.210 
audience cannot see is what goes on

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:42.399 
audience cannot see is what goes on
between<00:06:41.540> the<00:06:41.780> conductor<00:06:42.230> and

00:06:42.399 --> 00:06:42.409 
between the conductor and

00:06:42.409 --> 00:06:44.859 
between the conductor and

that and the musicians other than the
hand<00:06:45.080> movements<00:06:45.259> but<00:06:45.709> there's<00:06:45.919> also<00:06:46.069> a<00:06:46.189> lot<00:06:46.369> of

00:06:46.769 --> 00:06:46.779 
hand movements but there's also a lot of

00:06:46.779 --> 00:06:49.089 
hand movements but there's also a lot of
very<00:06:47.779> essential<00:06:48.169> communication<00:06:48.949> that

00:06:49.089 --> 00:06:49.099 
very essential communication that

00:06:49.099 --> 00:06:51.999 
very essential communication that
happens<00:06:49.129> between<00:06:50.089> the<00:06:50.330> eyes<00:06:50.889> you<00:06:51.889> know

00:06:51.999 --> 00:06:52.009 
happens between the eyes you know

00:06:52.009 --> 00:06:54.070 
happens between the eyes you know
whenever<00:06:52.189> there<00:06:52.580> is<00:06:52.610> an<00:06:52.819> important<00:06:53.389> entry<00:06:53.869> or

00:06:59.379 --> 00:06:59.389 
the musician just the fraction of a

second before just to make sure that he

00:07:10.119 --> 00:07:10.129 
her or with him at that moment so that

her or with him at that moment so that
we<00:07:10.369> have<00:07:10.489> this<00:07:10.639> little<00:07:11.089> mental<00:07:12.050> connection

00:07:12.459 --> 00:07:12.469 
we have this little mental connection

00:07:12.469 --> 00:07:13.659 
we have this little mental connection
right<00:07:12.860> before<00:07:13.189> something<00:07:13.489> difficult

00:07:13.659 --> 00:07:13.669 
right before something difficult

00:07:13.669 --> 00:07:16.989 
right before something difficult
happened<00:07:14.179> it<00:07:15.050> works<00:07:15.289> two<00:07:15.499> ways<00:07:15.529> you<00:07:15.999> know

00:07:16.989 --> 00:07:16.999 
happened it works two ways you know

00:07:16.999 --> 00:07:18.819 
happened it works two ways you know
there<00:07:17.149> are<00:07:17.179> moments<00:07:17.360> in<00:07:17.569> music<00:07:17.869> when<00:07:17.989> I<00:07:18.079> I<00:07:18.349> have

00:07:18.819 --> 00:07:18.829 
there are moments in music when I I have

00:07:18.829 --> 00:07:22.419 
there are moments in music when I I have
105<00:07:19.729> paralyzed<00:07:20.449> and<00:07:20.919> then<00:07:21.919> there<00:07:22.069> are<00:07:22.099> moments

00:07:22.419 --> 00:07:22.429 
105 paralyzed and then there are moments

00:07:22.429 --> 00:07:25.239 
105 paralyzed and then there are moments
of<00:07:22.669> less<00:07:23.269> intensity<00:07:24.229> in<00:07:24.409> communication<00:07:25.099> where

00:07:25.239 --> 00:07:25.249 
of less intensity in communication where

00:07:25.249 --> 00:07:27.909 
of less intensity in communication where
I<00:07:25.429> just<00:07:25.699> let<00:07:25.879> them<00:07:25.909> get<00:07:26.719> on<00:07:26.779> with<00:07:27.050> it<00:07:27.079> and<00:07:27.199> play

00:07:27.909 --> 00:07:27.919 
I just let them get on with it and play

00:07:27.919 --> 00:07:30.399 
I just let them get on with it and play
the<00:07:28.039> music<00:07:28.159> and<00:07:28.489> I<00:07:29.239> try<00:07:29.449> to<00:07:29.479> create<00:07:30.289> an

00:07:30.399 --> 00:07:30.409 
the music and I try to create an

00:07:30.409 --> 00:07:32.889 
the music and I try to create an
illusion<00:07:30.589> of<00:07:30.860> not<00:07:31.279> being<00:07:31.550> there<00:07:31.699> the<00:07:31.909> whole

00:07:32.889 --> 00:07:32.899 
illusion of not being there the whole

00:07:32.899 --> 00:07:35.079 
illusion of not being there the whole
point<00:07:33.079> is<00:07:33.289> that<00:07:33.529> a<00:07:34.249> conductor<00:07:34.729> has<00:07:34.849> to<00:07:34.939> know

00:07:35.079 --> 00:07:35.089 
point is that a conductor has to know

00:07:35.089 --> 00:07:36.939 
point is that a conductor has to know
when<00:07:35.269> to<00:07:35.300> be<00:07:35.509> back<00:07:35.689> you<00:07:36.409> know<00:07:36.499> when<00:07:36.829> you're

00:07:36.939 --> 00:07:36.949 
when to be back you know when you're

00:07:36.949 --> 00:07:38.679 
when to be back you know when you're
needed<00:07:37.099> you<00:07:37.550> have<00:07:37.699> to<00:07:37.789> be<00:07:37.879> there<00:07:38.059> when<00:07:38.539> you're

00:07:38.679 --> 00:07:38.689 
needed you have to be there when you're
