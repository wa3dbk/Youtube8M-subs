00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.070
 hello how are football friends for the 

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:46.440
 band a very special greeting to all the 

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:48.300
 band to grind to today we are going to 

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:50.100
 back we did some tutorials back 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.690
 to check some strings where 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.370
 you had doubt I received 

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.589
 countless comments from the first 

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.110
 tutorial that I did where I did enough 

00:00:55.589 --> 00:00:59.970
 played so I chose five of them 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:03.650
 to explain them in detail in this 

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:03.650
 tutorial so let's start 

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:09.510
 This move must be made with much 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.490
 be careful because if you do it wrong you 

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:13.440
 Knee can explode 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:15.960
 you must practically stick your foot to 

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.760
 ball when doing it with your foot 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.190
 right you must move the ball towards the 

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:21.810
 right and in the same movement with the 

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:23.510
 tip of your foot you must change the 

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:27.140
 path of the ball to the left 

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:27.140
 confusing towards your rival 

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:33.189
 this move is only to bluff only 

00:01:31.539 --> 00:01:35.289
 they are made by the gÃ¼eyes that are some trunks 

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:36.869
 on the court and they want to call the 

00:01:35.289 --> 00:01:39.759
 attention doing things with the ball 

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:41.439
 all but me obviously with my foot 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:43.869
 right you must step on the ball towards 

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:46.600
 forward and in the same movement with the 

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:49.450
 left foot catch it pull it towards you 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.689
 and pick it up it sounds difficult but it does not 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:52.090
 is 

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:56.189
 it came to me like after about three 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:56.189
 years do not be discouraged I'm calm 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:03.320
 this move is one of my favorites since 

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.150
 which is quite difficult to do and go 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:07.400
 that there are guys who have tried it and 

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:09.709
 they end up with a sprained ankle if 

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.630
 you look good with your right foot you should 

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:13.220
 advance a little the ball so that 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:16.250
 your rival tries to prevent you from 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:18.500
 burles is there with that movement where 

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.870
 you must take advantage and make the tunnel you must 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:23.480
 pass the ball and with the other foot is , 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:27.160
 the support foot give the touch so that what 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.160
 pass between your rival's legs 

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:33.700
 is the truth to little not when you will do that 

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:35.530
 played in a game is pretty 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:38.829
 complicated and if you do not do it right you can 

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:41.109
 be in a good coma not so much but at a 

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:43.599
 of two if you leave everything you have left 

00:02:41.109 --> 00:02:45.640
 looking as if you were an android and if 

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:48.000
 you do not leave everything you are left seeing as 

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:51.400
 his android heart but in culero 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.530
 look carefully first you must advance the 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.780
 left foot and leave the ball behind 

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:58.659
 as if you had forgotten after 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:00.879
 with the other foot you must give two small 

00:02:58.659 --> 00:03:03.129
 touch one to the right and the other 

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:06.359
 to the left and so pass the ball 

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:06.359
 on the one hand of your rival 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:12.019
 you must be well standing and look 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:14.180
 well how do you do a squat 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:17.060
 perfect when collecting the ball 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:20.650
 It's not easy even if you do not believe it 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:20.650
 people do not get this move 

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:25.970
 there was a player there gave me famous 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:29.750
 who played in Madrid was called 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:31.460
 Roberto Carlos, so that guy is 

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:33.200
 it happened to see me on an air straight through 

00:03:31.460 --> 00:03:36.110
 my house doing this play and I the 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:38.150
 robbery is easy enough to just burn and so 

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:40.340
 you do not get the first try 

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:42.050
 you must advance the ball a little and 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:45.560
 moment that you feel that they are going to 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:48.740
 get to step on it with the right foot give you 

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:50.540
 the turn step on it and pull it with the other 

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:53.060
 foot so that with your foot supporting the 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:54.940
 up and so with a heel in the 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:57.770
 air make a hat to your rival 

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:59.870
 poderme not as easy to explain and 

00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:02.830
 It was very cool to see her do it and not 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:02.830
 let them copy it 

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:12.669
 there were the five moves 

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:14.650
 that you chose more so 

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:16.510
 I hope they practice them, they saw that they are 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:18.100
 easy enough I leave you here in my 

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:20.560
 social networks to tell me 

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:22.900
 I can not even be retained as much as they want 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:24.310

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:28.560
