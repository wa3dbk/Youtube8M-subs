okay<00:00:06.930> so<00:00:06.990> let's<00:00:07.350> talk<00:00:07.500> about<00:00:07.560> some<00:00:08.069> gems<00:00:08.970> to<00:00:09.360> be

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:09.510 
okay so let's talk about some gems to be

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.080 
okay so let's talk about some gems to be
aware<00:00:09.719> of<00:00:09.780> for<00:00:10.170> the<00:00:10.230> drawing<00:00:10.620> here<00:00:11.460> I've<00:00:11.580> got<00:00:11.820> a

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:12.090 
aware of for the drawing here I've got a

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.140 
aware of for the drawing here I've got a
simple<00:00:12.660> assembly<00:00:12.960> of<00:00:13.440> the<00:00:13.500> head<00:00:14.219> component<00:00:15.000> of

00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:15.150 
simple assembly of the head component of

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.260 
simple assembly of the head component of
a<00:00:15.719> flashlight<00:00:16.260> and<00:00:16.740> I'm<00:00:17.670> going<00:00:17.789> to<00:00:17.880> take<00:00:18.060> that

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:18.270 
a flashlight and I'm going to take that

00:00:18.270 --> 00:00:20.660 
a flashlight and I'm going to take that
into<00:00:18.330> the<00:00:18.960> drawing<00:00:19.199> simply<00:00:19.800> by<00:00:19.920> file<00:00:20.369> my

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:20.670 
into the drawing simply by file my

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:29.359 
into the drawing simply by file my
drawing<00:00:21.029> from<00:00:21.300> assembly<00:00:27.769> and<00:00:28.769> let's<00:00:29.070> choose

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:29.369 
drawing from assembly and let's choose

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.260 
drawing from assembly and let's choose
be<00:00:29.580> sized<00:00:29.849> give<00:00:30.119> us<00:00:30.240> plenty<00:00:30.599> of<00:00:30.810> space<00:00:32.270> okay

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270 
be sized give us plenty of space okay

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.780 
be sized give us plenty of space okay
hopefully<00:00:34.050> everyone's<00:00:34.710> aware<00:00:35.010> of<00:00:35.040> the<00:00:35.520> view

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:35.790 
hopefully everyone's aware of the view

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:38.209 
hopefully everyone's aware of the view
palette<00:00:36.239> if<00:00:36.540> not<00:00:36.960> it's<00:00:37.320> a<00:00:37.469> really<00:00:37.710> nice<00:00:37.920> tool

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
palette if not it's a really nice tool

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:39.950 
palette if not it's a really nice tool
to<00:00:38.399> be<00:00:38.489> able<00:00:38.520> to<00:00:38.760> drag<00:00:39.030> and<00:00:39.270> drop<00:00:39.450> your<00:00:39.660> views

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
to be able to drag and drop your views

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.410 
to be able to drag and drop your views
into<00:00:40.260> your<00:00:40.770> drawing<00:00:41.070> has<00:00:41.730> all<00:00:42.180> of<00:00:42.300> your

into your drawing has all of your

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.930 
into your drawing has all of your
standard<00:00:42.930> views<00:00:43.290> available<00:00:43.620> I<00:00:44.129> wanted<00:00:44.789> to

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:44.940 
standard views available I wanted to

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.910 
standard views available I wanted to
bring<00:00:45.390> attention<00:00:45.539> to<00:00:45.930> this<00:00:46.200> current<00:00:46.590> view

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
bring attention to this current view

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.319 
bring attention to this current view
just<00:00:47.160> be<00:00:47.280> very<00:00:47.430> careful<00:00:47.550> of<00:00:47.910> using<00:00:48.239> that

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
just be very careful of using that

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:50.660 
just be very careful of using that
because<00:00:48.660> it<00:00:48.780> will<00:00:48.899> change<00:00:49.260> depending<00:00:49.890> on<00:00:50.219> what

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:50.670 
because it will change depending on what

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.910 
because it will change depending on what
your<00:00:50.820> assembly<00:00:51.329> or<00:00:51.570> well<00:00:52.260> in<00:00:52.440> this<00:00:52.559> case<00:00:52.710> it's

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
your assembly or well in this case it's

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.310 
your assembly or well in this case it's
an<00:00:53.039> assembly<00:00:53.460> but<00:00:53.670> even<00:00:54.300> the<00:00:54.360> part<00:00:54.600> depending

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
an assembly but even the part depending

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:56.900 
an assembly but even the part depending
on<00:00:55.440> how<00:00:55.559> its<00:00:55.739> oriented<00:00:56.309> the<00:00:56.460> last<00:00:56.610> time<00:00:56.789> it

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910 
on how its oriented the last time it

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.430 
on how its oriented the last time it
will<00:00:57.000> save<00:00:57.239> that's<00:00:57.600> what<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:57.930> current<00:00:58.170> will

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
will save that's what the current will

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.950 
will save that's what the current will
be<00:00:58.469> so<00:00:59.309> it<00:00:59.609> might<00:00:59.820> change<00:01:00.059> on<00:01:00.329> you<00:01:00.480> so<00:01:00.660> just<00:01:00.690> be

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
be so it might change on you so just be

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:02.660 
be so it might change on you so just be
careful<00:01:01.140> of<00:01:01.440> that<00:01:01.500> sometimes<00:01:02.100> it<00:01:02.370> looks<00:01:02.520> just

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
careful of that sometimes it looks just

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:06.830 
careful of that sometimes it looks just
like<00:01:02.910> the<00:01:03.149> isometric<00:01:04.519> if<00:01:05.519> I<00:01:05.760> bring<00:01:06.030> a<00:01:06.240> view<00:01:06.659> in

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
like the isometric if I bring a view in

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:09.380 
like the isometric if I bring a view in
let's<00:01:07.290> say<00:01:07.619> i'll<00:01:08.520> just<00:01:08.760> bring<00:01:08.970> the<00:01:09.119> front

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
let's say i'll just bring the front

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:13.340 
let's say i'll just bring the front
viewing<00:01:10.189> and<00:01:11.189> I<00:01:11.400> want<00:01:11.610> to<00:01:11.670> keep<00:01:11.880> it<00:01:12.119> as<00:01:12.360> hidden

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.350 
viewing and I want to keep it as hidden

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.460 
viewing and I want to keep it as hidden
lines<00:01:13.710> removed<00:01:14.280> but<00:01:15.150> I'd<00:01:15.420> like<00:01:15.630> it<00:01:15.810> to<00:01:15.990> be<00:01:16.200> I

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:16.470 
lines removed but I'd like it to be I

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.050 
lines removed but I'd like it to be I
like<00:01:16.680> it<00:01:16.799> to<00:01:16.920> have<00:01:17.040> a<00:01:17.070> little<00:01:17.400> bit<00:01:17.549> more<00:01:17.759> color

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:18.060 
like it to have a little bit more color

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.420 
like it to have a little bit more color
to<00:01:18.210> it<00:01:18.509> and<00:01:18.780> I<00:01:19.080> did<00:01:19.560> like<00:01:19.740> I<00:01:19.830> said<00:01:19.979> I<00:01:20.009> don't<00:01:20.189> want

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:20.430 
to it and I did like I said I don't want

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:22.550 
to it and I did like I said I don't want
to<00:01:20.490> make<00:01:20.520> it<00:01:20.640> shaded<00:01:21.000> so<00:01:21.840> let<00:01:22.110> me<00:01:22.200> make<00:01:22.320> this<00:01:22.500> a

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
to make it shaded so let me make this a

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.999 
to make it shaded so let me make this a
little<00:01:22.680> bit<00:01:22.950> bigger<00:01:23.159> I<00:01:24.560> have<00:01:25.560> some<00:01:25.799> options

00:01:25.999 --> 00:01:26.009 
little bit bigger I have some options

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:28.370 
little bit bigger I have some options
that<00:01:26.369> were<00:01:26.549> added<00:01:27.060> and<00:01:27.180> not<00:01:27.720> a<00:01:27.750> big<00:01:27.990> deal<00:01:28.170> was

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
that were added and not a big deal was

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:29.929 
that were added and not a big deal was
made<00:01:28.560> about<00:01:28.770> this<00:01:29.100> and<00:01:29.340> I<00:01:29.369> don't<00:01:29.430> know<00:01:29.759> why

00:01:29.929 --> 00:01:29.939 
made about this and I don't know why

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:32.240 
made about this and I don't know why
because<00:01:30.180> I<00:01:30.420> think<00:01:30.509> it's<00:01:30.780> pretty<00:01:30.930> exciting<00:01:31.350> but

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
because I think it's pretty exciting but

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.580 
because I think it's pretty exciting but
in<00:01:32.490> the<00:01:32.700> document<00:01:33.270> properties<00:01:33.810> of<00:01:34.140> your

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
in the document properties of your

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.640 
in the document properties of your
drawing<00:01:34.939> under<00:01:35.939> detailing<00:01:36.659> there's<00:01:37.470> an

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
drawing under detailing there's an

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:40.550 
drawing under detailing there's an
option<00:01:37.829> to<00:01:38.040> use<00:01:38.670> the<00:01:38.850> model<00:01:39.180> color<00:01:39.450> for<00:01:39.960> hlr

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:40.560 
option to use the model color for hlr

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.950 
option to use the model color for hlr
hlv<00:01:41.220> in<00:01:41.460> drawings<00:01:43.670> so<00:01:44.670> that<00:01:44.790> now<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.390> color<00:01:45.840> of

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:45.960 
hlv in drawings so that now the color of

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.620 
hlv in drawings so that now the color of
the<00:01:46.320> part<00:01:46.619> is<00:01:46.860> reflected<00:01:47.430> in<00:01:47.579> the<00:01:47.909> lines<00:01:48.180> for

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
the part is reflected in the lines for

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.450 
the part is reflected in the lines for
the<00:01:48.810> drawing<00:01:49.140> it's<00:01:49.829> a<00:01:49.890> really<00:01:50.070> nice<00:01:50.250> way

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:50.460 
the drawing it's a really nice way

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:51.940 
the drawing it's a really nice way
especially<00:01:50.700> with<00:01:51.119> large<00:01:51.360> assemblies<00:01:51.899> to

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:51.950 
especially with large assemblies to

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:53.810 
especially with large assemblies to
differentiate<00:01:52.950> between<00:01:53.159> the<00:01:53.399> different

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:53.820 
differentiate between the different

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.569 
differentiate between the different
parts<00:01:54.149> especially<00:01:55.110> for<00:01:55.680> detailing<00:01:56.250> and

00:01:56.569 --> 00:01:56.579 
parts especially for detailing and

00:01:56.579 --> 00:01:58.310 
parts especially for detailing and
things<00:01:56.759> like<00:01:56.909> that<00:01:56.969> so<00:01:57.450> that's<00:01:57.719> a<00:01:57.869> good<00:01:58.020> one<00:01:58.170> to

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320 
things like that so that's a good one to

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:03.050 
things like that so that's a good one to
be<00:01:58.409> aware<00:01:58.590> of<00:02:01.040> another<00:02:02.040> thing<00:02:02.399> that<00:02:02.759> i<00:02:02.790> wanted

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
be aware of another thing that i wanted

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.270 
be aware of another thing that i wanted
to<00:02:03.210> point<00:02:03.420> out<00:02:03.630> for<00:02:04.079> drawing<00:02:04.469> specifically

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:05.280 
to point out for drawing specifically

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.459 
to point out for drawing specifically
sometimes<00:02:05.759> there's<00:02:05.969> a<00:02:06.030> very<00:02:06.360> very<00:02:06.719> specific

00:02:07.459 --> 00:02:07.469 
sometimes there's a very very specific

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:10.249 
sometimes there's a very very specific
view<00:02:07.860> that<00:02:08.099> you<00:02:08.220> need<00:02:08.429> to<00:02:08.610> find<00:02:08.879> and<00:02:09.810> include

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
view that you need to find and include

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.340 
view that you need to find and include
in<00:02:10.649> your<00:02:11.069> drawing<00:02:11.730> so<00:02:12.480> let's<00:02:12.660> let's

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
in your drawing so let's let's

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.290 
in your drawing so let's let's
they<00:02:13.440> just<00:02:13.710> for<00:02:13.920> example<00:02:14.010> I<00:02:14.610> needed<00:02:14.940> a<00:02:15.030> view

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
they just for example I needed a view

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.330 
they just for example I needed a view
that<00:02:15.510> was<00:02:15.630> very<00:02:15.870> specifically<00:02:16.650> just<00:02:17.160> like

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
that was very specifically just like

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.100 
that was very specifically just like
this<00:02:17.550> and<00:02:17.850> that's<00:02:18.000> not<00:02:18.240> really<00:02:18.570> front<00:02:18.930> top

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
this and that's not really front top

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:22.220 
this and that's not really front top
right<00:02:19.440> and<00:02:19.650> or<00:02:20.100> any<00:02:20.310> of<00:02:20.430> the<00:02:20.550> ISO<00:02:20.940> views<00:02:21.330> what<00:02:22.200> I

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
right and or any of the ISO views what I

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.110 
right and or any of the ISO views what I
can<00:02:22.440> do<00:02:22.710> I<00:02:22.920> showed<00:02:23.280> you<00:02:23.400> the<00:02:23.520> space<00:02:23.760> bar<00:02:24.060> a

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:24.120 
can do I showed you the space bar a

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.380 
can do I showed you the space bar a
little<00:02:24.240> bit<00:02:24.540> earlier<00:02:24.900> as<00:02:25.200> one<00:02:25.380> of<00:02:25.410> your<00:02:25.680> tips

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
little bit earlier as one of your tips

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:29.090 
little bit earlier as one of your tips
so<00:02:27.390> by<00:02:27.540> pressing<00:02:28.020> the<00:02:28.140> spacebar<00:02:28.410> it<00:02:28.740> brings<00:02:28.920> up

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:29.100 
so by pressing the spacebar it brings up

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.690 
so by pressing the spacebar it brings up
your<00:02:29.220> orientation<00:02:30.440> dialog<00:02:31.440> box<00:02:31.680> and<00:02:32.040> the<00:02:32.460> very

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:32.700 
your orientation dialog box and the very

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:35.300 
your orientation dialog box and the very
first<00:02:33.000> button<00:02:33.540> here<00:02:33.810> adds<00:02:33.990> a<00:02:34.590> new<00:02:34.800> view<00:02:35.100> so<00:02:35.250> it

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:35.310 
first button here adds a new view so it

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.700 
first button here adds a new view so it
looks<00:02:35.460> like<00:02:35.520> a<00:02:35.610> telescope<00:02:36.000> with<00:02:36.450> a<00:02:36.480> star<00:02:36.840> if

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:37.710 
looks like a telescope with a star if

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:39.860 
looks like a telescope with a star if
you<00:02:37.830> select<00:02:38.040> that<00:02:38.340> we<00:02:38.910> can<00:02:39.090> call<00:02:39.330> this<00:02:39.540> view

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:39.870 
you select that we can call this view

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.860 
you select that we can call this view
whatever<00:02:40.200> we<00:02:40.470> want<00:02:40.760> so<00:02:41.760> it's<00:02:41.880> called<00:02:42.150> a<00:02:42.390> named

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:42.870 
whatever we want so it's called a named

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:48.320 
whatever we want so it's called a named
view<00:02:43.290> and<00:02:43.560> I'll<00:02:43.800> say<00:02:44.100> this<00:02:44.460> is<00:02:44.760> um<00:02:46.640> bulb<00:02:47.640> view

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
view and I'll say this is um bulb view

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.150 
view and I'll say this is um bulb view
well<00:02:48.870> if<00:02:48.990> I<00:02:49.080> could<00:02:49.260> spell<00:02:49.590> that<00:02:49.770> would<00:02:49.890> be<00:02:49.980> good

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
well if I could spell that would be good

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:56.510 
well if I could spell that would be good
bulb<00:02:50.630> view<00:02:53.210> and<00:02:54.210> adds<00:02:54.600> it<00:02:54.780> to<00:02:54.840> the<00:02:54.960> list<00:02:55.520> but

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:56.520 
bulb view and adds it to the list but

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:58.820 
bulb view and adds it to the list but
also<00:02:56.790> what<00:02:57.180> it<00:02:57.300> does<00:02:57.540> is<00:02:57.900> adds<00:02:58.200> that<00:02:58.470> to<00:02:58.680> the

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:58.830 
also what it does is adds that to the

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:00.500 
also what it does is adds that to the
view<00:02:59.040> palette<00:02:59.430> now<00:02:59.550> so<00:02:59.850> if<00:02:59.940> i<00:03:00.030> look<00:03:00.060> at<00:03:00.330> my

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
view palette now so if i look at my

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.220 
view palette now so if i look at my
drawing<00:03:01.290> at<00:03:01.860> my<00:03:02.100> view<00:03:02.400> palette<00:03:02.820> I<00:03:03.000> now<00:03:03.840> if<00:03:04.080> i

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:04.230 
drawing at my view palette I now if i

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:08.780 
drawing at my view palette I now if i
refresh<00:03:04.410> my<00:03:04.980> views<00:03:05.310> have<00:03:06.410> my<00:03:07.410> bulb<00:03:07.680> view<00:03:08.010> so

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:08.790 
refresh my views have my bulb view so

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:15.050 
refresh my views have my bulb view so
you<00:03:08.820> can<00:03:09.000> include<00:03:09.420> that<00:03:09.600> as<00:03:09.660> well<00:03:10.050> a<00:03:13.970> lot<00:03:14.970> of

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:15.060 
you can include that as well a lot of

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:16.520 
you can include that as well a lot of
times<00:03:15.240> especially<00:03:15.450> once<00:03:16.020> your<00:03:16.200> drawings

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:16.530 
times especially once your drawings

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.230 
times especially once your drawings
start<00:03:16.770> getting<00:03:17.040> crowded<00:03:17.280> it's<00:03:17.880> kind<00:03:18.180> of

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:18.240 
start getting crowded it's kind of

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:21.170 
start getting crowded it's kind of
difficult<00:03:18.420> to<00:03:18.810> grab<00:03:19.170> the<00:03:19.560> frame<00:03:20.040> of<00:03:20.370> a<00:03:20.610> view<00:03:20.880> to

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.180 
difficult to grab the frame of a view to

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.660 
difficult to grab the frame of a view to
move<00:03:21.360> it<00:03:21.480> around<00:03:21.600> so<00:03:22.470> quick<00:03:22.740> tip<00:03:23.040> is<00:03:23.250> to<00:03:23.310> hold

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
move it around so quick tip is to hold

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:25.580 
move it around so quick tip is to hold
down<00:03:23.850> alt<00:03:24.030> when<00:03:24.840> you're<00:03:24.960> trying<00:03:25.170> to<00:03:25.320> drag<00:03:25.560> a

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:25.590 
down alt when you're trying to drag a

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:27.770 
down alt when you're trying to drag a
view<00:03:25.980> then<00:03:26.490> you<00:03:26.640> can<00:03:26.820> select<00:03:26.970> anywhere<00:03:27.570> within

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
view then you can select anywhere within

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.220 
view then you can select anywhere within
the<00:03:27.930> view<00:03:28.290> and<00:03:28.530> drag<00:03:28.830> that<00:03:29.000> so<00:03:30.000> alt<00:03:30.330> and<00:03:30.750> just

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
the view and drag that so alt and just

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.080 
the view and drag that so alt and just
select<00:03:31.380> anywhere<00:03:31.920> in<00:03:32.010> the<00:03:32.130> view<00:03:32.370> rather<00:03:32.940> than

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.090 
select anywhere in the view rather than

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:41.510 
select anywhere in the view rather than
having<00:03:33.450> to<00:03:33.600> grab<00:03:34.200> the<00:03:34.410> frame<00:03:34.620> itself<00:03:40.400> that's<00:03:41.400> a

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:41.520 
having to grab the frame itself that's a

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:45.830 
having to grab the frame itself that's a
little<00:03:41.700> bit<00:03:41.790> too<00:03:41.970> big

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.500 

there<00:03:46.840> we<00:03:46.959> go<00:03:47.049> okay<00:03:47.920> the<00:03:48.459> next<00:03:48.819> item<00:03:49.030> I<00:03:49.269> want<00:03:49.450> to

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:49.510 
there we go okay the next item I want to

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:51.660 
there we go okay the next item I want to
show<00:03:49.719> you<00:03:49.780> deals<00:03:50.170> with<00:03:50.409> dimensions<00:03:51.280> this<00:03:51.459> was

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:51.670 
show you deals with dimensions this was

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:54.720 
show you deals with dimensions this was
added<00:03:51.969> for<00:03:52.109> 2011<00:03:53.219> I'm<00:03:54.219> just<00:03:54.370> going<00:03:54.519> to<00:03:54.579> use<00:03:54.700> a

00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:54.730 
added for 2011 I'm just going to use a

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:56.879 
added for 2011 I'm just going to use a
smart<00:03:55.090> dimension<00:03:55.209> in<00:03:55.629> this<00:03:55.780> case<00:03:56.019> so<00:03:56.799> I'm

00:03:56.879 --> 00:03:56.889 
smart dimension in this case so I'm

00:03:56.889 --> 00:04:00.259 
smart dimension in this case so I'm
going<00:03:56.920> to<00:03:57.069> choose<00:03:57.340> these<00:03:58.060> edges<00:03:58.569> here<00:03:59.049> and

00:04:00.259 --> 00:04:00.269 
going to choose these edges here and

00:04:00.269 --> 00:04:02.819 
going to choose these edges here and
notice<00:04:01.269> we<00:04:01.510> get<00:04:01.629> our<00:04:01.750> rapid<00:04:02.170> dimension<00:04:02.680> which

00:04:02.819 --> 00:04:02.829 
notice we get our rapid dimension which

00:04:02.829 --> 00:04:04.740 
notice we get our rapid dimension which
you<00:04:03.010> can<00:04:03.159> turn<00:04:03.310> on<00:04:03.370> or<00:04:03.579> off<00:04:03.760> those<00:04:04.329> are<00:04:04.510> great

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:04.750 
you can turn on or off those are great

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:07.259 
you can turn on or off those are great
let's<00:04:05.739> just<00:04:05.859> not<00:04:06.189> use<00:04:06.430> those<00:04:06.639> for<00:04:06.849> a<00:04:06.909> second

00:04:07.259 --> 00:04:07.269 
let's just not use those for a second

00:04:07.269 --> 00:04:08.160 
let's just not use those for a second
thought<00:04:07.389> i'm<00:04:07.480> going<00:04:07.569> to<00:04:07.659> show<00:04:07.840> you<00:04:07.870> a<00:04:07.989> couple

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:08.170 
thought i'm going to show you a couple

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:12.869 
thought i'm going to show you a couple
things<00:04:08.519> and<00:04:09.519> i'll<00:04:10.239> do<00:04:10.480> from<00:04:11.109> here<00:04:11.620> to<00:04:11.680> here<00:04:12.280> and

00:04:12.869 --> 00:04:12.879 
things and i'll do from here to here and

00:04:12.879 --> 00:04:15.780 
things and i'll do from here to here and
just<00:04:13.030> kind<00:04:13.239> of<00:04:13.299> throw<00:04:13.569> it<00:04:13.719> on<00:04:13.840> there<00:04:14.790> that's

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:15.790 
just kind of throw it on there that's

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:18.779 
just kind of throw it on there that's
fine<00:04:16.180> maybe<00:04:16.780> i<00:04:16.840> want<00:04:16.959> to<00:04:17.079> change<00:04:17.349> that<00:04:17.789> instead

00:04:18.779 --> 00:04:18.789 
fine maybe i want to change that instead

00:04:18.789 --> 00:04:21.240 
fine maybe i want to change that instead
of<00:04:18.820> being<00:04:19.150> a<00:04:19.599> radius<00:04:20.410> maybe<00:04:20.680> i<00:04:20.769> want<00:04:20.889> this<00:04:21.070> to

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.250 
of being a radius maybe i want this to

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:25.230 
of being a radius maybe i want this to
be<00:04:21.370> a<00:04:21.400> linear<00:04:21.639> dimension<00:04:22.449> so<00:04:23.610> change<00:04:24.610> that<00:04:24.880> to

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.240 
be a linear dimension so change that to

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:30.719 
be a linear dimension so change that to
one<00:04:25.720> here<00:04:28.110> ok<00:04:29.110> now<00:04:29.800> i<00:04:29.830> want<00:04:30.190> to<00:04:30.280> sort<00:04:30.490> these

00:04:30.719 --> 00:04:30.729 
one here ok now i want to sort these

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:33.480 
one here ok now i want to sort these
dimensions<00:04:31.330> so<00:04:31.900> what<00:04:31.990> i<00:04:32.020> can<00:04:32.259> do<00:04:32.440> is<00:04:32.490> select

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:33.490 
dimensions so what i can do is select

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:38.460 
dimensions so what i can do is select
those<00:04:33.820> and<00:04:34.410> then<00:04:35.410> bicycle<00:04:36.220> missed<00:04:36.699> it<00:04:37.470> select

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:38.470 
those and then bicycle missed it select

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:42.180 
those and then bicycle missed it select
those<00:04:38.680> and<00:04:38.740> then<00:04:39.250> I<00:04:39.310> get<00:04:40.320> this<00:04:41.320> dialog<00:04:41.800> box<00:04:42.009> so

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:42.190 
those and then I get this dialog box so

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:43.260 
those and then I get this dialog box so
it's<00:04:42.310> a<00:04:42.370> little<00:04:42.490> button<00:04:42.849> you<00:04:42.910> have<00:04:43.000> to<00:04:43.120> hover

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:43.270 
it's a little button you have to hover

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:45.719 
it's a little button you have to hover
over<00:04:43.630> it<00:04:43.780> and<00:04:44.169> this<00:04:44.500> first<00:04:44.830> button<00:04:45.130> is<00:04:45.430> auto

00:04:45.719 --> 00:04:45.729 
over it and this first button is auto

00:04:45.729 --> 00:04:48.089 
over it and this first button is auto
arrange<00:04:46.360> dimensions<00:04:46.990> which<00:04:47.229> is<00:04:47.380> awesome<00:04:47.650> so

00:04:48.089 --> 00:04:48.099 
arrange dimensions which is awesome so

00:04:48.099 --> 00:04:50.219 
arrange dimensions which is awesome so
if<00:04:48.190> you<00:04:48.280> click<00:04:48.430> that<00:04:48.659> it<00:04:49.659> automatically

00:04:50.219 --> 00:04:50.229 
if you click that it automatically

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:52.200 
if you click that it automatically
spaces<00:04:50.919> those<00:04:51.130> and<00:04:51.460> determines<00:04:52.060> the

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:52.210 
spaces those and determines the

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:55.230 
spaces those and determines the
hierarchy<00:04:52.870> as<00:04:53.080> they<00:04:53.320> should<00:04:53.380> be<00:04:53.740> displayed<00:04:54.250> so

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:55.240 
hierarchy as they should be displayed so

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:56.610 
hierarchy as they should be displayed so
even<00:04:55.419> though<00:04:55.479> I<00:04:55.539> have<00:04:55.750> a<00:04:55.780> duplicate<00:04:56.110> here

00:04:56.610 --> 00:04:56.620 
even though I have a duplicate here

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:58.589 
even though I have a duplicate here
that's<00:04:56.830> okay<00:04:57.099> you<00:04:57.159> can<00:04:57.280> kind<00:04:57.610> of<00:04:57.669> see<00:04:57.970> what<00:04:58.570> I

00:04:58.589 --> 00:04:58.599 
that's okay you can kind of see what I

00:04:58.599 --> 00:05:01.950 
that's okay you can kind of see what I
was<00:04:58.810> referring<00:04:59.710> to<00:05:00.250> the<00:05:01.180> nice<00:05:01.360> thing<00:05:01.599> is<00:05:01.630> if

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:01.960 
was referring to the nice thing is if

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:04.050 
was referring to the nice thing is if
you<00:05:02.050> add<00:05:02.259> another<00:05:02.650> dimension<00:05:02.949> in<00:05:03.430> maybe<00:05:03.789> I<00:05:03.909> do

00:05:04.050 --> 00:05:04.060 
you add another dimension in maybe I do

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:07.320 
you add another dimension in maybe I do
a<00:05:04.240> dimension<00:05:04.870> now<00:05:05.320> from<00:05:05.919> the<00:05:06.159> corner<00:05:06.580> to<00:05:07.240> the

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:07.330 
a dimension now from the corner to the

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:10.860 
a dimension now from the corner to the
corner<00:05:07.509> of<00:05:07.780> this<00:05:07.930> guy<00:05:08.729> add<00:05:09.729> that<00:05:10.120> in<00:05:10.300> and<00:05:10.570> it

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:10.870 
corner of this guy add that in and it

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:13.879 
corner of this guy add that in and it
will<00:05:10.990> automatically<00:05:11.560> space<00:05:12.340> that<00:05:12.580> one<00:05:12.729> also

00:05:13.879 --> 00:05:13.889 
will automatically space that one also

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:18.960 
will automatically space that one also
so<00:05:14.889> it<00:05:15.039> continues<00:05:15.610> to<00:05:15.789> auto<00:05:15.940> space<00:05:17.849> so<00:05:18.849> that's

00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:18.970 
so it continues to auto space so that's

00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:22.650 
so it continues to auto space so that's
a<00:05:19.090> great<00:05:19.330> one<00:05:19.479> to<00:05:19.539> utilize<00:05:20.139> as<00:05:20.409> well
