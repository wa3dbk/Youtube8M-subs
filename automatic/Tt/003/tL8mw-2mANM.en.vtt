so<00:04:33.400> it's<00:04:33.520> not<00:04:33.639> going<00:04:33.880> like<00:04:34.120> that<00:04:34.470> or<00:04:35.470> anything

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:35.770 
so it's not going like that or anything

so it's not going like that or anything
like<00:04:35.800> that<00:04:35.949> it's<00:04:36.220> literally<00:04:36.639> if<00:04:36.789> you<00:04:36.880> just

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:37.090 
like that it's literally if you just

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:38.700 
like that it's literally if you just
hold<00:04:37.210> your<00:04:37.360> hand<00:04:37.539> there<00:04:37.780> and<00:04:37.960> literally<00:04:38.470> de

00:04:41.159 --> 00:04:41.169 
loosen up and just do at see that's

00:04:41.169 --> 00:04:42.899 
loosen up and just do at see that's
exactly<00:04:41.409> what<00:04:42.070> you<00:04:42.190> should<00:04:42.220> be<00:04:42.490> doing<00:04:42.520> it's

ok we'll do the more yang side of that

00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:34.670 
ok we'll do the more yang side of that
one<00:05:31.890> now<00:05:32.100> so<00:05:32.790> we<00:05:33.000> literally<00:05:33.270> got<00:05:33.500> just<00:05:34.500> that

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:34.680 
one now so we literally got just that

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:36.680 
one now so we literally got just that
it's<00:05:35.250> all<00:05:35.370> your<00:05:35.520> doing<00:05:35.640> the<00:05:35.970> old<00:05:36.180> slip<00:05:36.480> block

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:36.690 
it's all your doing the old slip block

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:40.160 
it's all your doing the old slip block
bang<00:05:37.610> and<00:05:38.610> we<00:05:38.760> got<00:05:38.880> straight<00:05:39.180> into<00:05:39.450> that<00:05:39.630> which

00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:40.170 
bang and we got straight into that which

00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:44.300 
bang and we got straight into that which
is<00:05:40.200> a<00:05:40.320> cut<00:05:40.590> down<00:05:40.800> on<00:05:41.010> the<00:05:41.130> on<00:05:41.310> the<00:05:43.010> loan<00:05:44.010> five

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:44.310 
is a cut down on the on the loan five

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:46.430 
is a cut down on the on the loan five
point<00:05:44.670> and<00:05:44.910> then<00:05:45.390> straight<00:05:45.900> in<00:05:46.050> with<00:05:46.170> a<00:05:46.230> strike

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:46.440 
point and then straight in with a strike

00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:48.860 
point and then straight in with a strike
although<00:05:47.100> the<00:05:47.280> cut<00:05:47.760> down<00:05:47.970> on<00:05:48.120> the<00:05:48.210> strike<00:05:48.750> will

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:48.870 
although the cut down on the strike will

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:50.480 
although the cut down on the strike will
happen<00:05:49.110> together<00:05:49.230> so<00:05:49.800> this<00:05:50.040> will<00:05:50.160> be<00:05:50.250> going

00:05:50.480 --> 00:05:50.490 
happen together so this will be going

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:54.650 
happen together so this will be going
like<00:05:50.550> this<00:05:52.130> that's<00:05:53.130> how<00:05:53.310> long<00:05:53.490> it<00:05:53.610> takes<00:05:53.850> so

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:54.660 
like this that's how long it takes so

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:57.530 
like this that's how long it takes so
it's<00:05:54.750> just<00:05:54.870> going<00:05:55.140> bang<00:05:56.180> but<00:05:57.180> what<00:05:57.330> do<00:05:57.390> you<00:05:57.450> got

00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:57.540 
it's just going bang but what do you got

00:05:57.540 --> 00:06:00.800 
it's just going bang but what do you got
what<00:05:57.870> you<00:05:57.900> got<00:05:57.990> to<00:05:58.140> make<00:05:58.230> sure<00:05:58.290> here<00:05:59.010> is<00:05:59.810> it's

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:00.810 
what you got to make sure here is it's

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:03.410 
what you got to make sure here is it's
going<00:06:01.050> like<00:06:01.230> that<00:06:01.290> and<00:06:01.910> then<00:06:02.910> there's<00:06:03.120> just<00:06:03.330> as

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:03.420 
going like that and then there's just as

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:05.870 
going like that and then there's just as
much<00:06:03.570> power<00:06:03.870> in<00:06:04.140> that<00:06:04.170> downward<00:06:04.680> strike<00:06:05.220> don't

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:05.880 
much power in that downward strike don't

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:07.370 
much power in that downward strike don't
lose<00:06:06.150> the<00:06:06.330> power<00:06:06.540> because<00:06:06.810> that's<00:06:07.020> the<00:06:07.200> one

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:07.380 
lose the power because that's the one

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:08.840 
lose the power because that's the one
that's<00:06:07.560> going<00:06:07.680> to<00:06:07.770> do<00:06:07.890> the<00:06:08.040> damage<00:06:08.250> actually

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:08.850 
that's going to do the damage actually

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:10.700 
that's going to do the damage actually
of<00:06:09.210> course<00:06:09.450> that's<00:06:09.600> the<00:06:09.810> killing<00:06:10.050> blow<00:06:10.260> to<00:06:10.410> the

00:06:10.700 --> 00:06:10.710 
of course that's the killing blow to the

00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:13.520 
of course that's the killing blow to the
end<00:06:11.330> so<00:06:12.330> it<00:06:12.420> looks<00:06:12.450> like<00:06:12.660> this<00:06:12.960> here<00:06:13.410> he<00:06:13.500> is

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:13.530 
end so it looks like this here he is

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:19.400 
end so it looks like this here he is
here<00:06:13.890> bang<00:06:14.610> that's<00:06:15.540> that's<00:06:15.990> possibly<00:06:18.140> my<00:06:19.140> most

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:19.410 
here bang that's that's possibly my most

00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:21.230 
here bang that's that's possibly my most
wonderful<00:06:19.620> shot<00:06:20.160> I<00:06:20.310> love<00:06:20.670> this<00:06:20.820> shot<00:06:21.090> because

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:21.240 
wonderful shot I love this shot because

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:24.080 
wonderful shot I love this shot because
it's<00:06:21.540> so<00:06:21.690> simple<00:06:22.050> and<00:06:22.350> yet<00:06:22.410> it's<00:06:23.040> so<00:06:23.790> effective

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:24.090 
it's so simple and yet it's so effective

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:26.300 
it's so simple and yet it's so effective
and<00:06:24.450> you<00:06:24.870> can<00:06:25.020> do<00:06:25.140> it<00:06:25.260> that<00:06:25.800> way<00:06:26.010> on<00:06:26.220> the

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:26.310 
and you can do it that way on the

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:30.170 
and you can do it that way on the
outside<00:06:26.340> for<00:06:27.030> two<00:06:27.780> it's<00:06:28.770> the<00:06:28.980> same<00:06:29.220> thing<00:06:29.550> see

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:30.180 
outside for two it's the same thing see

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:33.800 
outside for two it's the same thing see
you<00:06:30.900> can<00:06:31.050> do<00:06:31.170> a<00:06:31.200> an<00:06:32.100> inside<00:06:32.640> circle<00:06:33.000> or<00:06:33.510> you<00:06:33.660> can

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:33.810 
you can do a an inside circle or you can

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:37.700 
you can do a an inside circle or you can
do<00:06:34.020> the<00:06:34.710> outside<00:06:34.860> circle<00:06:36.290> so<00:06:37.290> you<00:06:37.350> can<00:06:37.530> use<00:06:37.680> it

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:37.710 
do the outside circle so you can use it

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:42.110 
do the outside circle so you can use it
either<00:06:37.980> way<00:06:38.810> so<00:06:39.810> we're<00:06:39.960> coming<00:06:40.230> here<00:06:40.440> bang<00:06:41.120> now
