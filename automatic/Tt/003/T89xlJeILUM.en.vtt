frantically as they used to and they are

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:19.580 
frantically as they used to and they are
much<00:01:18.450> easier<00:01:18.480> to<00:01:18.840> kill<00:01:19.050> because<00:01:19.320> they<00:01:19.440> just

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
much easier to kill because they just

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.860 
much easier to kill because they just
kind<00:01:19.740> of<00:01:19.770> sit<00:01:20.040> on<00:01:20.130> the<00:01:20.250> wall<00:01:20.450> also<00:01:21.450> if<00:01:21.600> you<00:01:21.630> have

the<00:01:29.910> drones<00:01:30.150> that<00:01:30.390> way<00:01:31.400> it's<00:01:32.400> best<00:01:32.610> used<00:01:32.850> when

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
the drones that way it's best used when

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:34.100 
the drones that way it's best used when

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
carry it into the next room because

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:55.580 
carry it into the next room because
there's<00:01:54.660> going<00:01:54.780> to<00:01:54.869> be<00:01:54.900> a<00:01:55.110> whole<00:01:55.320> bunch<00:01:55.500> of

brutes and it'll make killing the Brutes
in<00:01:58.170> the<00:01:58.229> next<00:01:58.470> area<00:01:58.830> a<00:01:58.890> lot<00:01:59.220> easier
