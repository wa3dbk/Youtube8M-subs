 14 

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.620
 but the protection of their how we bring pitiful 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.880
 feels much better 

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.880
 the city remains her 

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:52.540
 Zeil 

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:54.590

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.330
 People in front of their TVs in the ground 

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.120

 There is something wonderful about his brother 

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.090
 I think it was somehow 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.590
 luxury 

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:19.930
 discomfort 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:24.240

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.300
 thanks to the many sponsors Sarah Connor Christian Bale from the 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.300

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.280
 traditionally the weather prevails absolute ostrach I would have 

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.909
 Sina Basler Ciba, however, had allowed defenders to be mounted 

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:55.150
 Players too 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:56.510
 once back 

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:58.400

 Now Lars Lewerenz sees himself already at the same time it starts immediately 

00:02:20.279 --> 00:02:25.409
 38 195 kilometers to cover but none of the hint 

00:02:25.409 --> 00:02:28.519
 Over hundreds of participants are taken out of the hands 

00:02:29.019 --> 00:02:31.299
 Brigida is not just easy to drive on 

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:34.579
 Peter leave the field ahead of time and now it gets loud

 Legal consequence we know that in the c-class Brussels 

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:44.040

 cultural life of the other just a little bit 

00:06:28.809 --> 00:06:29.779
 it should 

00:06:29.779 --> 00:06:34.409
 but the talks about it will also put a burden on others 

00:06:34.409 --> 00:06:38.710
 Galler but the substitute Oliver Neuville wanted 

00:06:38.710 --> 00:06:41.710
