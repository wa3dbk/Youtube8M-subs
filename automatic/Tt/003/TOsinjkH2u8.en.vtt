00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:06.790
 davis tops in the first position of the 

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:06.790
 minor pentatonic scale 

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:11.889
 as a first step to find the 

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:14.190
 possible combinations of two ropes 

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:16.630
 two notes on string are made from the 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.619
 exhibition reviews with the position 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:19.619
 first position 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.029
 and says 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.980
 the combinations of two notes between 

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.980
 first and second string I have left 

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:48.730
 one 

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:48.730
 ah 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.870
 some are more consonant than others 

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:58.760
 I'm going to have some sentences and solve 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.760
 with some of the tops in that position 

00:01:02.899 --> 00:01:05.899
 ah 

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.780
 again 

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.200
 Y 

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:27.780
 the combinations that I have left between 

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:27.780
 second and third string are 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:35.110
 and 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.110
 ah 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.090
 again 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:45.400
 m 

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.470
 i 

00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:53.950
 now some phrases that integrate those 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.950
 22 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.970
 i 

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:00.970
 happy 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:07.960
 the combinations between third and fourth 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:10.170
 rope 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.170
 do not 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.750
 and 

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:42.790
 Y 

00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:54.230
 the combinations for fourth and fifth 

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:59.299
 rope would again be a 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:59.299
 qualification that enters after being equal 

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:08.140
 it is interesting also that from 

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:12.099
 fourth and fifth fourth and fifth and sixth 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:13.720
 rope my combinations of stops can 

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:15.819
 stop being a single and become a 

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:18.659
 riff of a song so I'm going to play it 

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:18.659
 as a king of subject 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:37.280
 Look 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:37.280
 combinations for fifth and sixth rooms 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:42.680
 do not 

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.680
 do not 

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:49.330
 90 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:08.270
 of the tops between all the strings of 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:11.270
 the first 

00:04:08.270 --> 00:04:11.270
 good 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.270
 and 

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:25.280
 one
