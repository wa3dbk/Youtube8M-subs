the<00:02:14.499> face<00:02:14.650> as<00:02:14.859> opposed<00:02:15.189> to<00:02:15.249> like<00:02:15.430> care<00:02:15.670> back

00:02:15.839 --> 00:02:15.849 
the face as opposed to like care back

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:17.640 
the face as opposed to like care back
and<00:02:16.209> wait<00:02:16.659> like<00:02:16.689> a<00:02:16.930> tank<00:02:17.200> top<00:02:17.319> or<00:02:17.530> something

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:17.650 
and wait like a tank top or something

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.039 
and wait like a tank top or something
just<00:02:18.129> seems<00:02:18.370> more<00:02:18.609> exposed<00:02:18.969> I<00:02:19.239> don't<00:02:19.900> know<00:02:19.959> if

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:20.049 
just seems more exposed I don't know if

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:21.000 
just seems more exposed I don't know if
that<00:02:20.200> makes<00:02:20.319> any<00:02:20.469> sense

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:21.010 
that makes any sense

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:22.379 
that makes any sense
I<00:02:21.040> don't<00:02:21.340> feel<00:02:21.579> like<00:02:21.700> it<00:02:21.849> kind<00:02:22.120> of<00:02:22.239> balances

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:22.389 
I don't feel like it kind of balances

00:02:22.389 --> 00:02:25.559 
I don't feel like it kind of balances
everything<00:02:23.260> out<00:02:23.650> the<00:02:24.129> other<00:02:24.249> way<00:02:24.430> is<00:02:24.700> you<00:02:25.090> do

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:18.370 
center and I know that that's not what

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.659 
center and I know that that's not what
really<00:03:19.120> consider<00:03:19.540> bangs<00:03:19.750> but<00:03:20.229> um<00:03:20.739> if<00:03:21.069> you<00:03:21.489> do

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:21.669 
really consider bangs but um if you do

00:03:21.669 --> 00:03:23.520 
really consider bangs but um if you do
have<00:03:21.879> bangs<00:03:22.120> and<00:03:22.419> you<00:03:22.479> want<00:03:22.750> them<00:03:23.019> to<00:03:23.049> grow<00:03:23.349> out

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:23.530 
have bangs and you want them to grow out

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.020 
have bangs and you want them to grow out
parting<00:03:24.069> them<00:03:24.189> down<00:03:24.340> the<00:03:24.489> middle<00:03:24.579> and<00:03:24.849> just

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:25.030 
parting them down the middle and just

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.599 
parting them down the middle and just
kind<00:03:25.239> of<00:03:25.269> blow<00:03:25.930> drying<00:03:26.229> them<00:03:26.560> back<00:03:27.069> away<00:03:27.549> from

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:27.609 
kind of blow drying them back away from

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:30.330 
kind of blow drying them back away from
the<00:03:27.879> face<00:03:28.060> and<00:03:28.449> what<00:03:29.229> that<00:03:29.439> does<00:03:29.709> is<00:03:29.949> it<00:03:30.099> kind

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
the face and what that does is it kind

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.879 
the face and what that does is it kind
of<00:03:30.400> just<00:03:30.639> met<00:03:31.049> makes<00:03:32.049> that<00:03:32.259> hair<00:03:32.439> like<00:03:32.650> kind<00:03:32.859> of

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:32.889 
of just met makes that hair like kind of

00:03:32.889 --> 00:03:34.559 
of just met makes that hair like kind of
melt<00:03:33.159> into<00:03:33.459> the<00:03:33.639> rest<00:03:33.879> of<00:03:34.000> your<00:03:34.060> hair<00:03:34.329> and<00:03:34.509> it

00:03:34.559 --> 00:03:34.569 
melt into the rest of your hair and it

00:03:34.569 --> 00:03:36.569 
melt into the rest of your hair and it
just<00:03:34.780> gives<00:03:35.079> the<00:03:35.229> illusion<00:03:35.439> of<00:03:35.919> longer<00:03:36.549> hair

00:03:36.569 --> 00:03:36.579 
just gives the illusion of longer hair

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:38.580 
just gives the illusion of longer hair
because<00:03:37.209> it<00:03:37.359> you<00:03:37.750> kind<00:03:37.959> of<00:03:38.049> can't<00:03:38.259> really<00:03:38.439> see

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
because it you kind of can't really see

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:41.729 
because it you kind of can't really see
it<00:03:38.680> just<00:03:38.859> looks<00:03:39.009> like<00:03:39.069> volume<00:03:39.370> and<00:03:40.739> not

00:03:41.729 --> 00:03:41.739 
it just looks like volume and not

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:43.890 
it just looks like volume and not
necessarily<00:03:42.159> like<00:03:42.400> a<00:03:42.430> layer<00:03:42.669> or<00:03:42.970> a<00:03:43.000> blunt<00:03:43.509> cut

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:43.900 
necessarily like a layer or a blunt cut

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.969 
necessarily like a layer or a blunt cut
so<00:03:44.639> anyway<00:03:45.639> that's<00:03:45.879> my<00:03:46.180> take<00:03:46.599> on<00:03:46.780> how<00:03:47.500> to<00:03:47.769> wear

00:03:47.969 --> 00:03:47.979 
so anyway that's my take on how to wear

00:03:47.979 --> 00:03:51.629 
so anyway that's my take on how to wear
your<00:03:48.040> bangs<00:03:48.370> if<00:03:48.819> you<00:03:48.970> enjoyed<00:03:49.269> and<00:03:50.579> I'll<00:03:51.579> see
