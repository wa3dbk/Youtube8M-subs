00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
kind of turn it to where it's like

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:19.100 
kind of turn it to where it's like
straight<00:01:15.330> up<00:01:15.450> and<00:01:15.630> down<00:01:16.250> and<00:01:17.720> if<00:01:18.720> this<00:01:18.869> isn't

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:19.110 
straight up and down and if this isn't

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:23.780 
straight up and down and if this isn't
really<00:01:19.320> easy<00:01:19.830> easy<00:01:20.130> to<00:01:20.670> do<00:01:22.280> but<00:01:23.280> it<00:01:23.549> was<00:01:23.670> the

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
really easy easy to do but it was the

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.950 
really easy easy to do but it was the
easiest<00:01:24.150> way<00:01:24.390> that<00:01:24.420> I<00:01:24.659> found<00:01:24.689> to<00:01:25.140> do<00:01:25.380> it<00:01:26.960> so

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:27.960 
easiest way that I found to do it so

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:29.420 
easiest way that I found to do it so
you're<00:01:28.500> gonna<00:01:28.680> need<00:01:28.740> to<00:01:28.829> remember<00:01:29.100> this<00:01:29.369> is

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
you're gonna need to remember this is

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:37.460 
you're gonna need to remember this is
for<00:01:29.700> six<00:01:30.090> gauge<00:01:31.430> and<00:01:35.360> it's<00:01:36.360> kind<00:01:36.869> of<00:01:37.020> hard<00:01:37.320> to

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
for six gauge and it's kind of hard to

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:40.340 
for six gauge and it's kind of hard to
do<00:01:37.860> to<00:01:38.070> be<00:01:38.159> honest<00:01:38.750> that's<00:01:39.750> of<00:01:39.900> course<00:01:40.049> because

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:40.350 
do to be honest that's of course because

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:44.060 
do to be honest that's of course because
you're<00:01:40.439> pushing<00:01:40.650> the<00:01:40.979> UM<00:01:41.189> flare<00:01:43.070> you're

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
you're pushing the UM flare you're

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:45.469 
you're pushing the UM flare you're
trying<00:01:44.369> to<00:01:44.490> push<00:01:44.670> the<00:01:44.820> flare<00:01:45.060> through<00:01:45.360> your

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:45.479
