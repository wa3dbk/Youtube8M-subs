00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:07.710
 Hello everyone here and mei today 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.750
 I bring the new challenge pokémon xy this 

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:12.900
 time they are checked and this is one 

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.970
 sort of a vengeance challenge on my part 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.340
 because this user I already had 

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:20.130
 challenged before and during that 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.380
 challenge had me completely leveled 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.570
 canceled destroyed 

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.489
 the other challenge was never put on 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.589
 channel because the connection has fallen but 

00:00:26.489 --> 00:00:30.960
 I practically played it all on 

00:00:28.589 --> 00:00:33.149
 defensive and therefore would certainly have it 

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.090
 he won so he started this 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:40.500
 challenge unleashing against one of mine 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:42.239
 last teams or a range game summit 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.489
 we'll talk about it during the video and in others 

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:45.780
 challenges and nothing we pass immediately to 

00:00:44.489 --> 00:00:47.370
 challenge that we have already lost too much time 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.730
 the unit with me gatt probably only 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.469
 for counter areas the fire made of 

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:54.179
 rowenta this here is a new increase 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:56.699
 it is no longer the old one is a new one 

00:00:54.179 --> 00:00:59.339
 washing machine model with max hp and max 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:00.960
 defense in fact as you just could 

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:02.699
 see has received attack sbrigo 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:06.360
 powered by sword dance divinely 

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:09.330
 and o supposed to let 123 enter 

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.430
 my trio duck trio is great 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.320
 pokémon is really incredible 

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:15.450
 especially because the truth between the arena 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.310
 which prevents the opponent 

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.860
 apart from a few exceptions such as pokémon 

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:22.620
 I suppose levitation closes in ghosts 

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:24.450
 pokemon of flying then peel 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:27.390
 I take out abso take advantage of mine 

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.940
 pokal tape now withdrawal from here or is a 

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.040
 assuming I let in and that the 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:34.530
 perfect counter for Brunello since 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:37.560
 absolutely can't touch this 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:41.070
 wonderful wii psycho who has a set 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:43.070
 as bastard as his ep spread 

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:45.420
 this mythical is my experiment 

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.890
 staff is not taken by smog is not 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.420
 taken anywhere 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.180
 and I must say that it really gives me a lot 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:53.250
 of satisfactions he short switch 

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.750
 I preach the switch and use reverse 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.760
 to have a switch in my turn 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.510
 favorable and that I will let in if not 

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:02.550
 again 123 that thanks to 

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:04.530
 breakaway baboon makes out chelsea in 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:06.660
 a stroke I remember he couldn't 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:09.720
 peel because my clio a tra 

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:13.110
 porena and pim pum pam conduct rio that a 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.860
 pokémon that I am the first person that I 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:16.320
 has 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.150
 now seen of Italians who use it I already have 

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:21.600
 made out two of his pokémon and yes 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:23.700
 speaks of a mega and dicense now predicted 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:26.010
 the frost splinters which was really obvious 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.630
 it was obvious how morning tea I do 

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.970
 enter rowenta who collects it 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.650
 divinely and now predict or one more 

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.330
 once his switch in this challenge 

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:36.180
 really made some good sermons and 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:38.370
 use at rest to go to sleep name e 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.900
 recover all life and wake up 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.880
 thanks to the chestnut 

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.500
 yes because this hot is exactly 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.090
 same as the previous one 

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:49.080
 the only thing that changes is that flawless 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:50.640
 therefore to all the righteous gods and has one 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.230
 different nature and a distribution 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:54.150
 different 

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.530
 I honestly didn't believe that a change 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:57.830
 breeding of the genus could 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:00.000
 cause consequences like this 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:01.620
 unbelievable because I find myself much better 

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.100
 corrupt a defensive 

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:08.160
 now I get Henry who is a good one 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:12.150
 counter for steam up to a certain point 

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:14.670
 but in the case of mine and yes yes because 

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:17.040
 this is the wii is exact in defense 

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:19.560
 special also in special defense e 

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:22.950
 owns a very very very move 

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:25.049
 powerful that you repeat and also provocation 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:28.799
 which are two moves that are perfect for 

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:30.540
 do the fantastic role of the world drake 

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:32.220
 but now I saw that I imagined him 

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:35.730
 predict axis my moves from worldwake 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:37.590
 use sunny day which is one of those 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:40.620
 moves that are expected in very few on 

00:03:37.590 --> 00:03:42.299
 wind si with built well enough 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:45.510
 his yellow ray precisely because this 

00:03:42.299 --> 00:03:48.239
 wind is partly a special defender 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.080
 he continues to protect me I continue 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:50.640
 is inside with 

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:53.580
 mine and I saw that he can't 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:57.090
 do it even here in reverse gear 

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:59.700
 he protects himself now switch to enter don 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:01.590
 fans and I honestly don't remember well 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:04.440
 what did I do yes I tried to do 

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:07.320
 repeat but obviously the failed move 

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:09.810
 because he knows switchato done this he 

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:13.460
 use frost splinter and I use 

00:04:09.810 --> 00:04:16.109
 reverse to not just escape e 

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:18.030
 field the reason why I have 

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:21.180
 put the sunny day but also for 

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:24.720
 break his strip skills in the field 

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:26.520
 now enters schwarzwald which will be the nightmare 

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:29.150
 absolute of my opponent for this 

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:34.200
 match because this is a saur veil 

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:36.300
 often sweeper sunny day setup ho 

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:38.460
 inverted you should say sunny days 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:43.590
 passion suite or a venous or 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:46.050
 takes advantage of the sun and e growth combo 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:48.720
 chlorophyll to make a quantity of 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:51.570
 damage simply incredible growth 

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:54.300
 in fact it increases by 2 attacks and attacks 

00:04:51.570 --> 00:04:55.890
 special if used in the sun also 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:57.360
 this venus aura the secret ability 

00:04:55.890 --> 00:05:00.060
 ie chlorophyll then its speed 

00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:01.950
 it's doubled on people and as if everything 

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:04.380
 this was not enough I gave him the deaf 

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:07.200
 hopes that together acted absorption 

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:09.480
 constitute really good 

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:11.430
 combo because I can do serious damage e 

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:14.340
 at the same time recover each time 

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:16.470
 the damage using gig absorption this 

00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:18.210
 it is a sauro new veil because I already had it 

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:19.830
 made a nice usa urss often years 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:22.440
 flipper or a sauro veil that I have 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:24.870
 shown in a double team though 

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:26.400
 it was not flores and had no gig 

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:28.080
 absorption which is a move 

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:31.050
 fundamental for this type of venus 

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:33.000
 aura this is flores is perfect 

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:34.260
 and it's simply a beast too 

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.630
 because it is modest 

00:05:34.260 --> 00:05:38.669
 now the sun ends he lets in 

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:39.960
 short field that is faster than I think 

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:41.580
 both scart 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:45.300
 because breil a usually is no longer 

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:47.580
 fast venus our even without sun e 

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:48.930
 venus howl is used in speed and in 

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:51.180
 special attack so I don't have well 

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:54.509
 understood why he used it anyway 

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:58.530
 on tomb I resist the glade with a ps 

00:05:54.509 --> 00:06:01.530
 schwarzwald and here I use bomb mud 

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:06.270
 to finish short and then finish ko to mine 

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:08.610
 time because of the hospitalization for the for the 

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:11.130
 his beast was at this point I close the 

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:13.620
 match with rowenta because he remains 

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:15.539
 only from a fan if I'm not mistaken that he doesn't 

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:18.539
 more store than then is no longer able 

00:06:15.539 --> 00:06:20.550
 to resist a blow of these yes 

00:06:18.539 --> 00:06:22.110
 kind and I too a rowenta step 

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:23.820
 in fact this water pump I must admit 

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:26.580
 who did less than I did 

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:28.020
 expect from the fan is much more bull than that 

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:31.380
 at the level of special defense of that 

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:33.090
 believed that precisely because it resists to a 

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:35.009
 intro I put closed privation but I have 

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:36.900
 already consumed my cedar boat for 

00:06:35.009 --> 00:06:39.240
 make the combo with rest then 

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:41.220
 deprivation does not receive the boost and I do 

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:42.419
 out of a fan crowned hydro pump 

00:06:41.220 --> 00:06:44.039
 I thank my adversary very much 

00:06:42.419 --> 00:06:45.030
 because it's really really really 

00:06:44.039 --> 00:06:46.530
 strong 

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:48.030
 I hope to challenge him again and I hope that 

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:50.479
 you liked this challenge too 

00:06:48.030 --> 00:06:50.479
 Hello
