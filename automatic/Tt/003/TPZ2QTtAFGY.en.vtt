 ingredients that will be used in this 

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:26.280

 approximately 300 ml 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:47.190
 for the filling I will use fresh coconut 

00:00:43.589 --> 00:00:50.429
 grated 500 grams for cover I will 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:54.179
 use ready-made icing cream 500 

00:00:50.429 --> 00:00:55.679
 various fruits and vegetables, preparing 

00:00:54.179 --> 00:00:58.739
 I'll put all the ingredients 

00:00:55.679 --> 00:01:02.339
 in the mixer and let mix for two 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:19.969
 minutes and first speed put the 

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:19.969
 wheat flour to margarine or yeast 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:29.899
 the refined sugar the gems 

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.549
 and water slowly 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:57.100
 now I'll move on to second speed 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.790
 let abate until a smooth dough and 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.790
 lean 

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:13.060
 I got to the desired point in the mass now 

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.010
 I'll take it to the table. 

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.870
 now I'm going to cover the dough with sack 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:23.830
 plastic and let stand for 30 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:26.410
 minutes after the rest of the dough I go 

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:29.380
 cut into four pieces of 400 grams 

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:32.820
 approximately four more pieces of 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:32.820
 approximately 70 grams 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:50.989
 I will not cut each piece in half or 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:50.989
 Open 

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:21.380
 because stop the fresh coconut 

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.980
 roll as a roll 

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:04.330
 it's good to open the smaller piece by hand 

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:15.520
 put the coconut fresh or close in 

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:15.520
 to thrash 

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:24.550
 I'll do the modeling by braiding the strips. 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:39.970
 joining the tips and putting in a 

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:44.699
 smooth baking sheet greased with 

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:44.699
 shapes of 20 centimeters in diameter 

00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:57.220
 the center I'll put the ball tight 

00:04:53.740 --> 00:05:00.419
 well and lead to grow in closet 

00:04:57.220 --> 00:05:03.639
 closed for approximately 60 minutes 

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:06.539
 after growing or brushing gems 

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:06.539
 on the breads 

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:14.620
 it will pass with the following 

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:18.460
 temperatures outside the turbo type to 140 

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:22.539
 degrees oven type ballast to 180 degrees by 

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:25.900
 an approximate time and 25 minutes after 

00:05:22.539 --> 00:05:31.259
 cassada rice or brush with gel of 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:31.259
 every surface shine 

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:44.379
 I put the icing cream on a 

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:52.539
 sleeve with a flat beak or put a 

00:05:44.379 --> 00:05:58.960
 of porcini cream and begin to 

00:05:52.539 --> 00:06:02.940
 to decorate with the apple putting in all the 

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:02.940
 Thread turn 

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:24.800
 I'll finish with the rest of the 

00:06:14.099 --> 00:06:24.800
 fruits putting the carambola on the cherries 

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:29.870
 it's the worst 

00:06:50.169 --> 00:06:55.689
 Lastly I will spread the glow gel 

00:06:52.569 --> 00:07:09.569
 to conserve fruits and give a brightness 

00:06:55.689 --> 00:07:12.819
