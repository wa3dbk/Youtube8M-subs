00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:11.690
 the other series that is played tomorrow 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.280
 pachuca america yes of your position with 

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:16.910
 america I went with america I do not know if the 

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:20.029
 Mr. Altamirano dance with America to me 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:23.510
 I have like the pebble that now the 

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:26.390
 tie pachuca or if you can give the 

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:28.310
 surprise at the speed you have can 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.990
 put in a lot of problems to a 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:31.550
 defense of the america that has not been seen 

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:33.470
 ok with I kill that's a big point 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:36.379
 because pachuca has elements 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:38.150
 young people of basic forces and even the 

00:00:36.379 --> 00:00:40.579
 that has already reached the level topic 

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:43.610
 selection or anne dressed the coat of 

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:46.250
 tricolor but also taking into account 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:47.750
 just what they say is another tournament the 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:51.070
 liguilla the famous party great good 

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:51.070
 Mexicans I believe that the trade 

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.260
 it seems to me that it is the office in the 

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.360
 technique and the trade as to 

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:01.550
 players because the players of the 

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:04.460
 pachuca young talented is true and 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.840
 it's a good gerardo factor that puts 

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.310
 on the table 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:09.439
 but many of them have not played 

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:11.990
 liguilla and have not been in distances 

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:15.170
 as protagónicas as these I also 

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:17.149
 I agree with you I think that 

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:18.469
 that will be fundamental to see how it arrives 

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:22.189
 this pachuca of course with the 

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:23.630
 young people that I think here one of the 

00:01:22.189 --> 00:01:25.610
 things that I would also put on the table 

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.409
 the hunger that all those young people have 

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:29.659
 who want to transcend but the sequence 

00:01:27.409 --> 00:01:31.399
 is important because the last two 

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:32.959
 or three days is this generation of 

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:35.270
 fast young people with enrique meza 

00:01:32.959 --> 00:01:37.369
 they came to the group and they fell so 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.619
 hot and the teacher lost the job 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:42.289
 for tourism for not answering in a league 

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:43.939
 it's time for people like jürgen dan 

00:01:42.289 --> 00:01:45.439
 irving I'm the ones who asked permission 

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:48.159
 so that the filling would stay like this 

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:51.500
 blackboard for this part pizarro pizarro 

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:54.229
 Herrera in defense of the elements 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:56.840
 there with other men like nahuelpán more 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:58.729
 that was like mosquera like the own 

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.920
 British that also already this goes back to 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:04.460
 regulation of course me Mexico is 

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:08.179
 a team know where the principal lives 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:10.340
 weak line or just the weakness of 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:12.170
 pachuca in the goal I think that this 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.209
 man that we saw on the oscar screen 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.120
 Perez rabbit has eaten a goal 

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:18.050
 in the regular phase of the tournament 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.430
 important does not have the same 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:21.470
 agility and is a man who does not have 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.430
 Reflections of that can also be 

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.440
 take advantage of some elements 

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:26.870
 americanists then you would have to see 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:29.239
 what weighs more the hunger that you comment 

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:31.340
 You comment that you gerardo or the 

00:02:29.239 --> 00:02:33.950
 trade from technical management 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:36.200
 internal as it has america by the 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.940
 last of guides that has disputed the 

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:41.800
 true much more complicated than 

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:44.930
 let me doubt much america 

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:47.930
 throughout the season if he was the champion 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:50.290
 of the concachampions but this america 

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:52.940
 since these players were signed 

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.920
 benedetto darwin quintero pellerano yo 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:57.920
 Yes we saw a blunderbuss of America 

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:00.080
 truth if I see a great team by and I think that 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:02.239
 also and it has shown in some day 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:04.850
 it's all about me that to see I is very not 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:07.010
 new player but he has not done anything is 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:08.630
 a lot of uncertainty the american you do not know 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:11.560
 when will he play well when he goes to 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:14.000
 golear or when you are going to play 

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:16.909
 of two victories against rivals 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.840
 difficult as it was Toluca as it was atlas 

00:03:16.909 --> 00:03:22.819
 If you think we listen, listen to 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.980
 the players of america who today 

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:25.790
 they gave a press conference so that 

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:30.489
 all the defense 

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:30.489
 aguilar goltz and the other day 

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:34.200
 to start since the tournament started 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:40.120
 america is always a candidate always 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:43.330
 is is a team that is to fight the 

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:45.850
 title is the tournament that you play 

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:47.320
 then leaving there it seems to me that 

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:50.800
 today we are in a good shape 

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:52.510
 we have as Paul said, treated of 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.490
 amend the mistakes that at times 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:55.750
 we had committed and it seems to me that we have 

00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:57.640
 closed rows we have closed well the 

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:00.340
 tournament and god want we can be a 

00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:02.680
 important match in pachuca not today in 

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:04.000
 door was a bicampeonato that from 

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:07.210
 start environment has been talked about so 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.120
 we see as such as as being called 

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:11.460
 club america we have to go out to 

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:13.270
 fight it and try to get it 

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:16.420
 concerns I think we have but 

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:18.430
 we are also very confident and for 

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:20.440
 Of course I think we do not know 

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:22.030
 another way other than fetching 

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:25.180
 three points and what are we going to try to 

00:04:22.030 --> 00:04:26.920
 do for your we also know that by 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:28.670
 moment of the game you can not go all 

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:30.860
 time 

00:04:28.670 --> 00:04:33.660
 but we have people of experience to 

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:35.280
 me to handle those moments 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:37.110
 but what we are going to do first is 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:39.780
 try to look for the win I think it's 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:41.280
 a group with a lot of experience that is 

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:42.450
 also a little bit of what I just said 

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:44.430
 that the moments that had to appear 

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:47.100
 the team seemed perhaps with markers 

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:49.350
 adverse or after a hard blow the 

00:04:47.100 --> 00:04:52.170
 true that the team got up and by 

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:54.060
 Of course, that's why we arrived very 

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:55.590
 well to this group and classified in 

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:58.590
 the second position 

00:04:55.590 --> 00:05:00.090
 pachuca has very good players already 

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:02.070
 has shown throughout the tournament that 

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:04.500
 that anyone can beat anyone 

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:06.900
 so it's always going to be very complicated 

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:08.610
 we are already in a group starting and 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:10.440
 back so it's going to be a very match 

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:13.640
 very difficult and we have to be at 

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:13.640
 height of each commitment 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:19.890
 well we know that for the series more 

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:21.330
 America , I said so, I'm going to America and I 

00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:24.480
 I think there may be a tie in the first leg 

00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:27.150
 and in the return then he can win in 

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:29.610
 america, the only thing I would ask is that 

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:32.000
 paul aguilar do not let him celebrate that 

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:32.000
 way 

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:36.950
 that both 

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:46.650
 is a character that tomorrow you go 

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:49.740
 in what sense in pachuca america in 

00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:52.919
 pachuca I think America wins 

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:56.190
 I think they go to Pachuca, Pachuca 

00:05:52.919 --> 00:05:57.990
 and america being congruent with what 

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:59.669
 I said yesterday will have to turn around in 

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:03.090
 plastic but in truth I go to pachuca 

00:05:59.669 --> 00:06:05.130
 very very dangerous I talk about the 

00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:07.850
 roosters but will be coming back from the cut 

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:09.870
 because here I have two to two roosters 

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:12.720
 people 

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:14.610

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:16.290
