is incredibly hard to find a match

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:56.980 
is incredibly hard to find a match
because<00:00:55.610> the<00:00:55.760> servers<00:00:56.210> can<00:00:56.360> always<00:00:56.630> go<00:00:56.780> down

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:56.990 
because the servers can always go down

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:58.870 
because the servers can always go down
at<00:00:57.140> some<00:00:57.290> points<00:00:57.620> are<00:00:57.800> there<00:00:58.280> were<00:00:58.430> points<00:00:58.700> at

00:00:58.870 --> 00:00:58.880 
at some points are there were points at

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.580 
at some points are there were points at
times<00:00:59.120> where<00:00:59.480> the<00:00:59.660> actual<00:00:59.930> server<00:01:00.230> crashes

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:00.590 
times where the actual server crashes

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:02.650 
times where the actual server crashes
several<00:01:01.130> points<00:01:01.280> so<00:01:01.610> honestly<00:01:02.360> the<00:01:02.480> first

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:02.660 
several points so honestly the first

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:04.329 
several points so honestly the first
thing<00:01:02.900> they<00:01:02.990> need<00:01:03.140> to<00:01:03.170> do<00:01:03.410> is<00:01:03.620> definitely<00:01:04.100> fix

00:01:04.329 --> 00:01:04.339 
thing they need to do is definitely fix

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:06.520 
thing they need to do is definitely fix
the<00:01:04.909> integration<00:01:05.750> of<00:01:05.810> the<00:01:05.900> server<00:01:06.140> allow

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:06.530 
the integration of the server allow

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:08.469 
the integration of the server allow
people<00:01:06.890> to<00:01:07.009> connect<00:01:07.310> a<00:01:07.400> lot<00:01:07.549> easier<00:01:07.790> number

00:01:08.469 --> 00:01:08.479 
people to connect a lot easier number

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:10.030 
people to connect a lot easier number
two<00:01:08.930> what<00:01:09.170> I<00:01:09.200> think<00:01:09.470> they<00:01:09.560> should<00:01:09.740> do<00:01:09.860> is<00:01:10.009> I

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:10.040 
two what I think they should do is I

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:11.580 
two what I think they should do is I
think<00:01:10.159> they<00:01:10.400> should<00:01:10.549> implement<00:01:10.820> a

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:11.590 
think they should implement a

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.020 
think they should implement a
Elimination<00:01:12.590> Chamber<00:01:12.799> style<00:01:13.249> match<00:01:13.520> into<00:01:13.909> the

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.030 
Elimination Chamber style match into the

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:15.999 
Elimination Chamber style match into the
actual<00:01:14.359> online<00:01:14.810> integration<00:01:15.469> system<00:01:15.619> meaning

00:01:15.999 --> 00:01:16.009 
actual online integration system meaning

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:17.739 
actual online integration system meaning
you<00:01:16.490> can<00:01:16.609> actually<00:01:16.909> go<00:01:17.030> online<00:01:17.179> with<00:01:17.479> six

00:01:17.739 --> 00:01:17.749 
you can actually go online with six

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:19.779 
you can actually go online with six
other<00:01:17.929> players<00:01:18.259> and<00:01:18.560> have<00:01:19.039> an<00:01:19.280> elimination
