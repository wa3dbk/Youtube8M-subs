00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:06.240
 as the state does a lot and it 

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:09.059
 they will have noticed or maybe not uploaded 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.490
 video in a month and the truth I already felt 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.650
 wrong because it says that a lot of people have 

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:16.980
 followed in this time that we have climbed 

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:20.160
 videos that it goes is a bit strange but 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.990
 at 100 105 I do not remember how many 

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.970
 I have to subscribe to the truth 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:26.519
 thank you very much for me already arrived 

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.949
 the 100 is already another achievement in life 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.230
 because I know that some people 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.120
 is liking my videos taking the subject 

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.980
 that I want to show a video that is 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.329
 snacks that are super - fast super 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:40.500
 easy and cheap but here all 

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:43.020
 depending on how many people what 

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.510
 do and what you buy but to me 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:49.440
 it came out cheap in a way in these 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:51.359
 snacks are delicious I think if 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.070
 you have a meeting and you do not have the 

00:00:51.359 --> 00:00:55.440
 Less idea of what to do or account is 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.690
 very little time I'm going to help you 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.850
 doing it is very fast and very easy to see 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:03.230
 create make snacks easier and 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.230
 quick things to do in your life 

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:08.470
 chocolate cookies filled with glasses 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:11.170
 of plastic glass if you have no where 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:13.229
 put your install is milk and sticks 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.229
 wood 

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:18.340
 first what we have to do is 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.920
 talk to all the cookies you want 

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:23.710
 occupy on the pallets and break them in 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:28.320
 bits you can leave the stuffing 

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:28.320
 you want or if it is not your preference 

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:33.579
 and there has to be something left 

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:36.100
 grab the glass and let's start 

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:38.829
 put cookies but not all we put 

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:41.350
 milk we put more beauties again 

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:43.860
 and in the end all the cookies and more 

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.860
 milk 

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:52.130
 the tools to make the pallets 

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:55.850
 I had to put a plastic and I'm going to 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:58.130
 put on the stick so it does not fall 

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.570
 At the end we put it in the freezer 

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:02.670
 preference one night 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.110
 it was difficult for me to take off 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.330
 palettes then what I did was 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.670
 heat a little water and put it 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:11.790
 for about 10 seconds the palette and it 

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:14.370
 takes off super easy to eject 

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.079
 chocolate in flavor you want but I do 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.150
 a pause to tell you not to buy from 

00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:20.159
 the commercial ones but like these that 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.319
 they come like this because if they have not yielded the 

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:24.780
 chocolate to be able to handle it and a 

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:27.030
 plastic tupper little things to decorate 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:29.129
 and convergent cookies let's start 

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:31.079
 with the slow chocolate but you will see 

00:02:29.129 --> 00:02:32.880
 how many more invitations 

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:35.370
 then they cost it 

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:38.340
 then we put the chocolate to the micro 

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:40.710
 for 35 seconds here the important thing is 

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.510
 know how to handle chocolate if 

00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:45.360
 it still does not melt enough 

00:02:42.510 --> 00:02:48.210
 put it back in but this time only 25 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:50.100
 seconds this is so that it does not burn and 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:52.730
 here you are not accommodating with a stick 

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:52.730
 plastic 

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:02.150
 let's put the melted chocolate with 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:06.040
 a teaspoon on top of the cookies 

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:06.040
 until everything is well covered 

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:14.840
 very fast before it dries we put 

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.840
 the decoration above the cookie 

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:29.290
 debate the cookies wait like 15 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:34.689
 and after that effect the same 

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:34.689
 to make them look better and the decoration 

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:42.730
 plastic with a chocolate spoon 

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:45.170
 of the flavor that your property and that will be 

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:47.590
 the one that has no flavor 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:51.670
 let's heat chocolate like 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:55.120
 hi5 reheat 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:56.770
 then we put the cereal and we started 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.910
 stir with the spoon until everything 

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:59.910
 the cereal has chocolate 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:15.190
 you're preferably you have to do the 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:18.989
 same plate so that when 

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:18.989
 take off be much, much easier 

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:25.880
 and so they would be at the end as they are 

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:28.090
 You can spread them dry by hand or 

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:30.550
 if not with a knife 

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:35.610
 and at the end they are well arranged 

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:35.610
 and they really know address 

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:41.800
 by the way I found this person 

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:43.780
 I miss meals and everything I did 

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:46.240
 How true that is also easy is 

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:48.009
 They are very easy for me and I hope 

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.870
 that for you too and that this 

00:04:48.009 --> 00:04:52.180
 video and serve them right now already as 

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:55.030

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:57.819
 of mothers your birthday a 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:59.470

00:04:57.819 --> 00:05:01.840
 Well I hope I have served you 

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:04.360
