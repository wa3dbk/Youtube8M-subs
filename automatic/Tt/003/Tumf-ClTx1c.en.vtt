00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:16.240

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:19.530
 bad and the 33 lucky video and I have it 

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:22.330

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:27.759

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:30.970
 you do not have to put a lot of hand in case 

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:34.169
 I'm cutting something that no other 

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:34.169

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:37.590

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:43.449

 but why do not I eat like this 

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:54.430
 a box-trap of these 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:54.430
 before a possible 

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:02.829
 It's worth firing the oil box over here 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.829
 in the problem of the amount 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:11.000
 if I'm doing it a little weird in the 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.000
 open this layer I 'm already realizing 

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:19.960
 it's good and what we see is this 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:22.990
 as we're going to get it out first is what 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:24.430
 what is the game and the shirt 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:28.880
 this is an invoice that is not necessary 

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:32.420
 that we see it below you already have a box 

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:35.650
 to see is on the shirt 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:35.650
 let's open it 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.050
 and I know of someone that I have here at 

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:49.210
 side of me that is going to get right away 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:51.840
 to see the size is the m yo just the m 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.670
 the goods or what side 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.770
 let's leave the admire from behind comes 

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.409
 mario kart 8 

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:02.460
 ok let's leave it here and go to 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:04.670
 see the game under his turn has seen I have 

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:08.550
 until the game ignores 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:11.510
 how do you like that I loved you and has it worth 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.510
 let's open it 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:15.390
 it comes to them in the camera 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:22.500
 well and that we are here 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:25.849
 your days taking pieces of cardboard here 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.849
 It is what it is 

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:34.030
 even the cat it's what scares me 

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:36.880
 they have the games they can do to me and 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.680
 we started with the sun spots is that 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:41.890
 I did not say this but it is an edition 

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:44.170
 multi europe you see here the logo 

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:46.870
 disgusting is what most of the 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:50.170
 editions is not taught to the box that I 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.970
 I already check the game I'm happy 

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.849
 in the back what was to wait 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:57.280
 in several languages here it goes up 

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:58.850
 walls and on ceilings leads without 

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.340
 limits 

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:05.150
 let's pull and let's see the game what 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:07.640
 I said the disgusting logo peggy the 

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:09.610
 German is that I hate him and I'm in the 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:12.100
 first time I see it 

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:15.370
 you have to choose what you do to me 

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:17.420
 logo trash of these colors 

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:21.060
 what's left 

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:24.840
 with a cover without cinemas in 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:28.099
 Manchurrones and the island change 

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.099
 we see her from behind 

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:35.030
 the code that will serve to get a 

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:37.459
 free game of the selection that gives 

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:39.980
 nintendo remember not to register it until 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:41.480
 10 o'clock on Friday morning but 

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:43.700
 to cover our asses as it has already 

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:45.380
 passed other times to wait for us 

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:48.200
 three in the afternoon easily because I 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:51.110
 ten past five one tomorrow record the 

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:53.239
 paper mario and I was left without yes in the 

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:54.520
 album because nintendo did not want it 

00:03:53.239 --> 00:03:57.510
 send 

00:03:54.520 --> 00:04:00.290
 so without hurry register them printed 

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:05.209
 instruction crap 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:08.020
 and more crap talk care that 

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:10.720
 we hide with the instructions 

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:14.470
 and it is already valid that it is a game of 

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:16.690
 car racing but at least 

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:18.630
 something like grace man not a shabby 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:22.230
 paper 

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:26.040
 and the game this we are going to qatar but already 

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:28.780
 same let's leave it that we keep and 

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:31.650
 let's take out the figure 

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:31.650
 has ice 

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:36.310
 we'll see 

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:43.289
 OK 

00:04:39.639 --> 00:04:43.289
 white well it 's a moment 

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:53.550
 those papers but they are the base comes 

00:04:49.030 --> 00:04:53.550
 loose ay ay 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:05:00.110
 and we see here that comes to bits in the 

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:02.000
 figure here is now what would be the 

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:04.460
 base that hooks here good 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.590
 present chocolate 

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:09.129
 this is put there but it does not get hooked 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:12.070
 nothing to be careful 

00:05:09.129 --> 00:05:14.920
 let's leave it there that you see 

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:17.280
 and the carapace there beige and the size of 

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:17.280
 my hand 

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:23.790
 has the gaps of what would be the 

00:05:20.470 --> 00:05:23.790
 back in the head and so on 

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:30.890
 a little dirty but not any 

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:35.220
 imperfection so too much 

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:37.320
 some small color here weird and you're 

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:40.080
 let's put it here and now we see it 

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:42.870
 more closely , we're already seeing it 

00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:45.630
 up close this is some hair is 

00:05:42.870 --> 00:05:47.640
 It highlights I have at home that dust 

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:49.110
 that clean do you want me to say I have 

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:51.570
 three cats 

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:55.850
 we will go in mario kart I do not know if it will be 

00:05:51.570 --> 00:05:55.850
 well and how nice is 

00:05:56.350 --> 00:06:00.370
 let's raise the camera a little 

00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:03.000
 up and you see that they appear not 

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:03.000
 It has a lot of mystery 

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:06.500
 but there is very cool 

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:11.440
 It does not have as many defects as the glasses 

00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:16.680
 of the nintendo club because of the cup 

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:16.680
 of the club they do not have fabric but there you see it 

00:06:17.230 --> 00:06:23.409
 perfect 

00:06:19.849 --> 00:06:23.409
 in comparison I do not know 

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:28.690
 here in the game box the index the 

00:06:26.360 --> 00:06:28.690
 size 

00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:33.210
 good and that has been all that is 

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:35.770
 limited edition of mario kart 

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:39.370
 remember the figure this is the 

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:41.770
 shell the piece box that luckily 

00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:44.440
 I've come quite intact I'm not going 

00:06:41.770 --> 00:06:46.720
 to complain about the game with the manchurrÃ³n 

00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:48.270
 to see if I get a normal cover 

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:51.040
 I leave it scanned in the description 

00:06:48.270 --> 00:06:52.930
 for whoever ordered this edition 

00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:55.870
 be with this disgust of 

00:06:52.930 --> 00:06:57.640
 cover and the shirt that's why he has 

00:06:55.870 --> 00:07:00.430
 asked in game form for the shirt he 

00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:02.320
 at least one little detail more and nothing 

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:04.120
 people this has been the video a boxing of 

00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:07.800
 the limited edition of mario cal us 

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:07.800
 we see in the next up to the view
