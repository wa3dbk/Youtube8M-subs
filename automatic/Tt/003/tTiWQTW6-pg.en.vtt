differential when it's out already it

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.289 
differential when it's out already it
wasn't<00:00:13.170> an<00:00:13.259> easy<00:00:13.349> job<00:00:13.530> but<00:00:13.950> shouldn't<00:00:14.460> take<00:00:14.639> if

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
between the front of the front chef now

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:48.770 
between the front of the front chef now
by<00:00:47.460> the<00:00:47.520> way<00:00:47.670> this<00:00:47.820> triangle<00:00:48.180> got<00:00:48.390> to<00:00:48.480> come<00:00:48.629> out

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
by the way this triangle got to come out

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.170 
by the way this triangle got to come out
it's<00:00:48.960> got<00:00:49.079> to<00:00:49.170> pop<00:00:49.320> out<00:00:49.530> when<00:00:49.820> you<00:00:50.820> take<00:00:50.969> it<00:00:51.090> out

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
it's got to pop out when you take it out

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.060 
it's got to pop out when you take it out
if<00:00:51.480> you<00:00:51.600> don't<00:00:51.750> pop<00:00:52.050> that<00:00:52.289> out<00:00:52.320> you<00:00:52.739> won't<00:00:52.920> be

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
if you don't pop that out you won't be

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.310 
if you don't pop that out you won't be
able<00:00:53.280> to<00:00:53.399> have<00:00:53.640> enough<00:00:53.879> space<00:00:54.239> to<00:00:54.840> pull<00:00:55.110> all

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:55.320 
able to have enough space to pull all

00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:01.479 
able to have enough space to pull all
the<00:00:55.620> shaft<00:00:55.980> out<00:00:57.020> on<00:00:58.020> this<00:00:58.379> section<00:00:58.879> from<00:00:59.879> the

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:01.489 
the shaft out on this section from the

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:07.160 
the shaft out on this section from the
transfer<00:01:02.489> case<00:01:02.760> hold<00:01:03.270> on<00:01:03.510> transfer<00:01:04.019> case<00:01:05.750> in<00:01:06.750> a

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
transfer case hold on transfer case in a

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.480 
transfer case hold on transfer case in a
second<00:01:07.500> we'll<00:01:07.619> see<00:01:07.770> where<00:01:07.920> it<00:01:07.950> connects<00:01:08.310> from

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:08.490 
second we'll see where it connects from

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:10.310 
second we'll see where it connects from
I<00:01:08.850> think<00:01:09.330> it's<00:01:09.479> gonna<00:01:09.600> hear<00:01:09.869> it<00:01:09.930> connects<00:01:10.229> to

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.320 
I think it's gonna hear it connects to

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.130 
I think it's gonna hear it connects to
the<00:01:10.560> transfer<00:01:10.979> case<00:01:11.220> on<00:01:12.060> that<00:01:12.720> section<00:01:12.960> right

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
the transfer case on that section right

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.160 
the transfer case on that section right
here<00:01:13.650> it<00:01:13.770> goes<00:01:13.950> in<00:01:14.280> now<00:01:14.580> why<00:01:14.850> should<00:01:15.119> to<00:01:15.330> this

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
here it goes in now why should to this

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.170 
here it goes in now why should to this
triangle<00:01:16.770> is<00:01:16.979> a<00:01:17.009> triangle<00:01:17.400> just<00:01:17.850> knock<00:01:18.000> it<00:01:18.090> out

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:26.610 
to fold down and then you'll have about

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.940 
to fold down and then you'll have about
that<00:01:26.850> much<00:01:27.060> gap<00:01:27.509> from<00:01:28.500> the<00:01:28.560> front

here after well before you open this for
I<00:03:47.019> would<00:03:47.170> recommend<00:03:47.799> what<00:03:48.400> you<00:03:48.430> need<00:03:48.640> to<00:03:48.730> do<00:03:48.850> is

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:48.940 
I would recommend what you need to do is

00:03:48.940 --> 00:03:50.490 
I would recommend what you need to do is
you<00:03:49.030> need<00:03:49.180> to<00:03:49.209> take<00:03:49.420> that<00:03:49.570> frame<00:03:49.989> like<00:03:50.380> you

00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:50.500 
you need to take that frame like you

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:51.960 
you need to take that frame like you
think<00:03:50.680> they<00:03:50.830> call<00:03:50.980> it<00:03:51.010> the<00:03:51.130> key<00:03:51.370> frame<00:03:51.700> because

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:51.970 
think they call it the key frame because

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:53.720 
think they call it the key frame because
it's<00:03:52.150> kind<00:03:52.299> of<00:03:52.330> like<00:03:52.510> look<00:03:52.720> like<00:03:52.900> the<00:03:53.200> letter<00:03:53.350> K

it's kind of like look like the letter K

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:56.699 
it's kind of like look like the letter K
but<00:03:54.730> you<00:03:54.850> got<00:03:55.000> to<00:03:55.090> take<00:03:55.239> death<00:03:55.450> frame<00:03:55.959> out<00:03:56.200> and

00:03:56.699 --> 00:03:56.709 
but you got to take death frame out and

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:00.600 
but you got to take death frame out and
there's<00:03:57.040> going<00:03:57.220> to<00:03:57.280> be<00:03:57.480> I<00:03:58.480> took<00:03:58.900> one<00:03:59.290> two<00:04:00.100> three

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:10.680 
connected to the frame right now right
there<00:04:09.250> you<00:04:09.459> see<00:04:09.670> it's<00:04:09.820> not<00:04:10.060> connected<00:04:10.570> I<00:04:10.660> think

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:10.690 
there you see it's not connected I think

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:12.479 
there you see it's not connected I think
there's<00:04:11.320> a<00:04:11.380> bolt<00:04:11.590> it<00:04:11.739> hold<00:04:11.980> it<00:04:12.130> together<00:04:12.250> it

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:12.489 
there's a bolt it hold it together it

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:13.710 
there's a bolt it hold it together it
held<00:04:12.670> it<00:04:12.790> together<00:04:12.910> so<00:04:13.269> there<00:04:13.420> are<00:04:13.480> three

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:13.720 
held it together so there are three

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:14.970 
held it together so there are three
bolts<00:04:13.930> on<00:04:14.140> this<00:04:14.290> side<00:04:14.500> and<00:04:14.650> then<00:04:14.769> there<00:04:14.950> are

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:14.980 
bolts on this side and then there are

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:16.259 
bolts on this side and then there are
another<00:04:15.220> two<00:04:15.340> that<00:04:15.760> I<00:04:15.850> didn't<00:04:16.120> open

00:04:16.259 --> 00:04:16.269 
another two that I didn't open

00:04:16.269 --> 00:04:21.060 
another two that I didn't open
completely<00:04:16.900> out<00:04:17.640> this<00:04:18.640> is<00:04:18.790> one<00:04:19.180> of<00:04:19.209> them

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:21.070
