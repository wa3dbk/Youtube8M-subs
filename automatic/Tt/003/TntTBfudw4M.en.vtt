update on my phytoplankton farm had a
couple<00:00:24.230> problems<00:00:24.919> basically<00:00:25.250> with<00:00:25.880> batches

properly thoroughly cleaning these out
or<00:00:56.199> taking<00:00:57.199> cultures<00:00:57.949> from<00:00:58.219> the<00:00:58.429> fridge<00:00:58.729> i<00:00:59.059> had

00:00:59.529 --> 00:00:59.539 
or taking cultures from the fridge i had

00:00:59.539 --> 00:01:01.959 
or taking cultures from the fridge i had
been<00:00:59.780> taking<00:01:00.280> some<00:01:01.280> cultures<00:01:01.729> from<00:01:01.879> the

00:01:01.959 --> 00:01:01.969 
been taking some cultures from the

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:05.290 
been taking some cultures from the
fridge<00:01:02.359> because<00:01:03.159> one<00:01:04.159> culture<00:01:04.670> end<00:01:04.820> up<00:01:05.000> dying

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:05.300 
fridge because one culture end up dying

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.320 
fridge because one culture end up dying
and<00:01:05.570> the<00:01:06.020> reason<00:01:06.409> why<00:01:06.560> it<00:01:06.620> died<00:01:07.070> was<00:01:07.520> I<00:01:07.970> was

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:08.330 
and the reason why it died was I was

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.530 
and the reason why it died was I was
basically<00:01:08.690> experimenting<00:01:09.640> and<00:01:10.640> I<00:01:10.700> had<00:01:10.880> one

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:11.540 
basically experimenting and I had one

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.320 
basically experimenting and I had one
culture<00:01:12.200> that<00:01:12.530> had<00:01:12.740> been<00:01:12.980> one<00:01:13.580> week<00:01:13.790> old

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:14.330 
culture that had been one week old

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.710 
culture that had been one week old
it<00:01:14.630> was<00:01:14.840> almost<00:01:15.620> black<00:01:15.950> like<00:01:16.340> coffee<00:01:16.670> and<00:01:17.600> I

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:17.720 
it was almost black like coffee and I

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.540 
it was almost black like coffee and I
just<00:01:17.960> wanted<00:01:18.320> to<00:01:18.380> see<00:01:18.650> what<00:01:18.860> would<00:01:18.980> happen<00:01:19.430> if

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:19.550 
just wanted to see what would happen if

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:22.030 
just wanted to see what would happen if
I<00:01:19.670> added<00:01:19.820> more<00:01:20.240> Miracle<00:01:20.930> Grow<00:01:21.140> at<00:01:21.350> that<00:01:21.560> point

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:22.040 
I added more Miracle Grow at that point

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.460 
I added more Miracle Grow at that point
and<00:01:22.190> let<00:01:22.730> it<00:01:22.850> grow<00:01:23.060> for<00:01:23.360> another<00:01:23.930> week<00:01:24.170> long

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:24.470 
and let it grow for another week long

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.450 
and let it grow for another week long
ended<00:01:25.220> up<00:01:25.340> surviving<00:01:25.850> three<00:01:26.330> more<00:01:26.540> days<00:01:26.720> and

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:27.460 
ended up surviving three more days and

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.420 
ended up surviving three more days and
basically<00:01:28.460> died<00:01:29.200> the<00:01:30.200> other<00:01:30.380> time<00:01:30.710> that<00:01:31.280> it

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:31.430 
basically died the other time that it

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:37.230 
basically died the other time that it
happened<00:01:31.970> I<00:01:34.240> basically

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:37.240 
happened I basically

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.740 
happened I basically
had<00:01:37.750> a<00:01:37.780> culture<00:01:38.350> in<00:01:38.620> here<00:01:39.040> it<00:01:39.880> was<00:01:40.000> too<00:01:40.270> hot<00:01:40.510> it

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:40.750 
had a culture in here it was too hot it

00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:43.110 
had a culture in here it was too hot it
got<00:01:40.930> up<00:01:41.080> to<00:01:41.230> like<00:01:41.440> I<00:01:41.770> don't<00:01:41.890> know<00:01:42.190> 90<00:01:42.790> degrees

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:43.120 
got up to like I don't know 90 degrees

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.360 
got up to like I don't know 90 degrees
in<00:01:43.300> here<00:01:43.510> I<00:01:43.540> actually<00:01:43.780> did<00:01:44.170> it<00:01:44.260> with<00:01:44.410> this<00:01:45.100> door

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:45.370 
in here I actually did it with this door

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:48.210 
in here I actually did it with this door
closed<00:01:45.780> so<00:01:46.780> I<00:01:46.810> lost<00:01:47.050> that<00:01:47.320> culture<00:01:47.800> that<00:01:47.830> way

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:48.220 
closed so I lost that culture that way

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:53.130 
closed so I lost that culture that way
and<00:01:49.770> then<00:01:50.770> I<00:01:50.800> lost<00:01:51.220> that<00:01:51.640> culture<00:01:52.360> or<00:01:52.690> another

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:53.140 
and then I lost that culture or another

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.500 
and then I lost that culture or another
culture<00:01:53.680> by<00:01:54.340> taking<00:01:54.820> one<00:01:54.940> out<00:01:54.970> of<00:01:55.150> the<00:01:55.270> fridge

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:55.510 
culture by taking one out of the fridge

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:59.100 
culture by taking one out of the fridge
so<00:01:56.070> not<00:01:57.070> really<00:01:57.310> sure<00:01:57.580> oh<00:01:58.150> yeah<00:01:58.480> I<00:01:58.690> know<00:01:58.960> I<00:01:58.990> know

00:01:59.100 --> 00:01:59.110 
so not really sure oh yeah I know I know

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.010 
so not really sure oh yeah I know I know
one<00:01:59.530> died<00:01:59.770> because<00:02:00.130> I<00:02:00.400> didn't<00:02:00.970> have<00:02:01.210> proper

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:02.020 
one died because I didn't have proper

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.010 
one died because I didn't have proper
water<00:02:02.740> movement<00:02:03.310> in<00:02:03.400> there<00:02:03.610> so<00:02:04.270> what<00:02:04.570> I<00:02:04.600> did<00:02:04.720> is

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:05.020 
water movement in there so what I did is

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:06.840 
water movement in there so what I did is
I<00:02:05.140> went<00:02:05.290> ahead<00:02:05.380> and<00:02:05.590> split<00:02:06.010> it<00:02:06.160> to<00:02:06.340> a<00:02:06.400> series<00:02:06.790> of

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:06.850 
I went ahead and split it to a series of

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.310 
I went ahead and split it to a series of
three<00:02:07.500> little<00:02:08.500> tea<00:02:09.130> barbs<00:02:09.520> and<00:02:09.840> ball<00:02:10.840> valves

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:11.320 
three little tea barbs and ball valves

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.740 
three little tea barbs and ball valves
and<00:02:11.530> I'm<00:02:12.190> trying<00:02:12.580> to<00:02:12.700> see<00:02:12.910> if<00:02:13.030> I<00:02:13.180> can<00:02:13.360> get<00:02:13.540> these

00:02:13.740 --> 00:02:13.750 
and I'm trying to see if I can get these

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:17.310 
and I'm trying to see if I can get these
to<00:02:14.410> grow<00:02:14.560> right<00:02:14.830> here<00:02:15.240> this<00:02:16.240> bat<00:02:16.540> tray<00:02:16.840> here

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.320 
to grow right here this bat tray here

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:20.040 
to grow right here this bat tray here
was<00:02:17.590> the<00:02:17.709> one<00:02:17.890> that<00:02:18.070> I<00:02:18.190> split<00:02:19.120> into<00:02:19.300> three<00:02:19.720> but

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:20.050 
was the one that I split into three but

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:23.100 
was the one that I split into three but
it<00:02:20.170> was<00:02:20.350> almost<00:02:20.590> jet-black<00:02:21.100> in<00:02:21.730> three<00:02:21.970> days<00:02:22.209> so

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:23.110 
it was almost jet-black in three days so

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.520 
it was almost jet-black in three days so
hopefully<00:02:23.770> tomorrow<00:02:24.250> night<00:02:25.000> we'll<00:02:25.420> see<00:02:25.450> a<00:02:26.140> big

hopefully tomorrow night we'll see a big

00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:29.190 
hopefully tomorrow night we'll see a big
difference<00:02:26.770> in<00:02:27.760> color<00:02:28.150> so<00:02:28.570> I'll<00:02:28.750> go<00:02:28.930> ahead<00:02:28.959> and

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:29.200 
difference in color so I'll go ahead and

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.250 
difference in color so I'll go ahead and

morning just put the system together
keep<00:02:53.680> them<00:02:53.800> kind<00:02:53.950> of<00:02:54.130> concerned

keep them kind of concerned

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:58.350 
keep them kind of concerned
maybe<00:02:55.920> this<00:02:56.920> bottle<00:02:57.340> right<00:02:57.489> here<00:02:57.550> is<00:02:58.030> dying

00:02:58.350 --> 00:02:58.360 
maybe this bottle right here is dying

00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:01.170 
maybe this bottle right here is dying
off<00:02:58.660> and<00:02:58.690> this<00:02:59.410> so<00:02:59.709> is<00:02:59.860> this<00:03:00.100> one<00:03:00.370> I<00:03:00.610> noticed

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180 
off and this so is this one I noticed

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.170 
off and this so is this one I noticed
that<00:03:01.510> this<00:03:01.660> one<00:03:01.900> has<00:03:02.080> an<00:03:02.260> air<00:03:02.380> stone<00:03:02.709> in<00:03:02.980> it

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:03.180 
that this one has an air stone in it

00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:06.660 
that this one has an air stone in it
seems<00:03:04.180> to<00:03:04.450> work<00:03:04.630> a<00:03:04.840> lot<00:03:05.019> better<00:03:05.320> than<00:03:05.950> just<00:03:06.310> the

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:06.670 
seems to work a lot better than just the

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:09.690 
seems to work a lot better than just the
straws<00:03:07.030> in<00:03:07.989> here<00:03:08.380> but<00:03:08.680> basically<00:03:09.280> it<00:03:09.519> came

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:09.700 
straws in here but basically it came

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:11.400 
straws in here but basically it came
down<00:03:09.940> here<00:03:10.239> there's<00:03:10.480> a<00:03:10.540> lot<00:03:10.750> of<00:03:10.870> settlement

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:11.410 
down here there's a lot of settlement

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:14.820 
down here there's a lot of settlement
down<00:03:11.530> here<00:03:11.800> on<00:03:11.890> the<00:03:11.980> bottom<00:03:12.100> so<00:03:13.090> I<00:03:13.810> just<00:03:14.590> did<00:03:14.800> a

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:14.830 
down here on the bottom so I just did a

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:19.050 
down here on the bottom so I just did a
quick<00:03:15.040> change<00:03:15.660> put<00:03:16.660> it<00:03:16.750> in<00:03:16.810> a<00:03:16.900> big<00:03:17.110> up<00:03:17.700> air<00:03:18.700> pump

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
quick change put it in a big up air pump

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:20.850 
quick change put it in a big up air pump
on<00:03:19.269> there

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:20.860 
on there

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:23.250 
on there
and<00:03:21.040> let's<00:03:22.030> hope<00:03:22.210> for<00:03:22.480> the<00:03:22.540> best<00:03:22.690> because<00:03:22.990> this

00:03:23.250 --> 00:03:23.260 
and let's hope for the best because this

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:31.010 
and let's hope for the best because this
is<00:03:23.410> all<00:03:23.710> I<00:03:23.740> have<00:03:24.190> left

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:31.020 

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:32.250 

durka

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:32.260 
durka

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:43.600 
durka
but<00:03:32.440> it<00:03:32.800> looks<00:03:33.040> like

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:43.610 

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:46.390 

hey<00:03:44.610> guys<00:03:44.849> fourth<00:03:45.269> day<00:03:45.569> on<00:03:45.840> the<00:03:45.989> phytoplankton

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:46.400 
hey guys fourth day on the phytoplankton

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.050 
hey guys fourth day on the phytoplankton
looks<00:03:47.400> like<00:03:47.670> the<00:03:47.879> first<00:03:48.209> bottle<00:03:48.780> is<00:03:49.349> done

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:50.060 
looks like the first bottle is done

00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:52.729 
looks like the first bottle is done
who's<00:03:51.060> second<00:03:51.480> bottles<00:03:51.840> almost<00:03:52.470> done

00:03:52.729 --> 00:03:52.739 
who's second bottles almost done

00:03:52.739 --> 00:03:55.100 
who's second bottles almost done
probably<00:03:52.980> be<00:03:53.220> done<00:03:53.370> all<00:03:53.670> night<00:03:53.940> and<00:03:54.780> the<00:03:54.870> third

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:55.110 
probably be done all night and the third

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:56.600 
probably be done all night and the third
bottle<00:03:55.560> looks<00:03:55.739> like<00:03:55.950> it's<00:03:56.129> gonna<00:03:56.310> be<00:03:56.489> about

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:56.610 
bottle looks like it's gonna be about

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:00.440 
bottle looks like it's gonna be about
two<00:03:56.970> days<00:03:58.129> as<00:03:59.129> you<00:03:59.280> guys<00:03:59.489> can<00:03:59.730> see<00:03:59.790> this<00:04:00.180> one's

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:00.450 
two days as you guys can see this one's

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:02.750 
two days as you guys can see this one's
way<00:04:00.750> more<00:04:00.989> darker<00:04:01.410> than<00:04:01.590> this<00:04:01.739> one<00:04:02.010> well<00:04:02.340> I<00:04:02.370> put

way more darker than this one well I put

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.930 
way more darker than this one well I put
more<00:04:02.970> phytoplankton<00:04:03.420> in<00:04:03.959> this<00:04:04.170> one<00:04:04.670> than<00:04:05.670> this

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
more phytoplankton in this one than this

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:09.619 
more phytoplankton in this one than this
one<00:04:06.269> and<00:04:06.599> very<00:04:07.110> little<00:04:07.440> in<00:04:07.560> this<00:04:07.769> one<00:04:08.010> so<00:04:08.629> I'm

00:04:09.619 --> 00:04:09.629 
one and very little in this one so I'm

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:11.360 
one and very little in this one so I'm
going<00:04:09.750> to<00:04:09.840> go<00:04:10.019> ahead<00:04:10.140> and<00:04:10.410> harvest<00:04:10.680> this<00:04:11.069> batch

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:11.370 
going to go ahead and harvest this batch

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:14.839 
going to go ahead and harvest this batch
right<00:04:11.700> here<00:04:12.180> split<00:04:12.599> it<00:04:13.370> so<00:04:14.370> I<00:04:14.400> can<00:04:14.640> start

00:04:14.839 --> 00:04:14.849 
right here split it so I can start

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:19.490 
right here split it so I can start
feeding<00:04:15.650> my<00:04:16.650> hot<00:04:16.859> tub<00:04:17.209> so<00:04:18.209> I'll<00:04:18.900> shoot<00:04:19.290> another

00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:19.500 
feeding my hot tub so I'll shoot another

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:33.020 
feeding my hot tub so I'll shoot another
video<00:04:19.889> that's<00:04:19.979> warm

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:33.030 

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:35.790 

well<00:04:34.030> hey<00:04:34.180> guys<00:04:34.389> here's<00:04:34.780> the<00:04:34.840> last<00:04:35.139> day<00:04:35.500> of<00:04:35.530> the

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:35.800 
well hey guys here's the last day of the

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:39.450 
well hey guys here's the last day of the
phytoplankton<00:04:36.220> grow<00:04:37.199> as<00:04:38.199> you<00:04:38.350> guys<00:04:38.560> can<00:04:38.800> see<00:04:38.860> I

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:39.460 
phytoplankton grow as you guys can see I

00:04:39.460 --> 00:04:43.200 
phytoplankton grow as you guys can see I
have<00:04:40.330> split<00:04:40.930> this<00:04:41.139> culture<00:04:41.830> I<00:04:42.100> have<00:04:42.880> the<00:04:43.060> other

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:43.210 
have split this culture I have the other

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:47.219 
have split this culture I have the other
culture<00:04:43.780> in<00:04:43.930> the<00:04:44.050> fridge<00:04:44.350> and<00:04:45.810> we're<00:04:46.810> starting

00:04:47.219 --> 00:04:47.229 
culture in the fridge and we're starting

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:50.100 
culture in the fridge and we're starting
over<00:04:47.350> on<00:04:47.650> that<00:04:47.860> one<00:04:48.190> this<00:04:48.789> one's<00:04:49.090> the<00:04:49.360> same<00:04:49.600> and

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:50.110 
over on that one this one's the same and

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:53.430 
over on that one this one's the same and
so<00:04:50.860> is<00:04:51.039> this<00:04:51.220> one<00:04:51.460> you<00:04:52.000> guys<00:04:52.180> can<00:04:52.419> tell<00:04:52.630> that

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:53.440 
so is this one you guys can tell that

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:56.879 
so is this one you guys can tell that
one<00:04:53.710> has<00:04:53.919> been<00:04:54.280> getting<00:04:54.580> darker<00:04:55.240> and<00:04:55.710> so<00:04:56.710> is

00:04:56.879 --> 00:04:56.889 
one has been getting darker and so is

00:04:56.889 --> 00:04:59.610 
one has been getting darker and so is
this<00:04:57.070> one<00:04:57.130> so<00:04:57.690> it<00:04:58.690> looks<00:04:58.870> like<00:04:59.080> we<00:04:59.259> did<00:04:59.440> really

00:04:59.610 --> 00:04:59.620 
this one so it looks like we did really

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:04.379 
this one so it looks like we did really
good<00:05:00.060> on<00:05:01.060> this<00:05:01.300> grow<00:05:02.789> me<00:05:03.789> and<00:05:03.910> Mad<00:05:04.090> Hatter

00:05:04.379 --> 00:05:04.389 
good on this grow me and Mad Hatter

00:05:04.389 --> 00:05:06.210 
good on this grow me and Mad Hatter
wreath<00:05:04.720> have<00:05:04.990> been<00:05:05.139> talking<00:05:05.530> about<00:05:05.800> ways<00:05:06.190> to

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:06.220 
wreath have been talking about ways to

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:09.870 
wreath have been talking about ways to
test<00:05:07.210> for<00:05:07.539> nitrates<00:05:08.080> and<00:05:08.410> phosphates<00:05:09.099> you

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:09.880 
test for nitrates and phosphates you

00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:11.550 
test for nitrates and phosphates you
know<00:05:10.000> on<00:05:10.120> the<00:05:10.210> one<00:05:10.330> concern<00:05:10.780> that<00:05:10.960> I<00:05:11.050> had<00:05:11.259> was

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:11.560 
know on the one concern that I had was

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:15.870 
know on the one concern that I had was
basically<00:05:12.539> testing<00:05:13.539> the<00:05:14.340> solution<00:05:15.340> here<00:05:15.610> with

00:05:15.870 --> 00:05:15.880 
basically testing the solution here with

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:20.010 
basically testing the solution here with
a<00:05:16.300> color<00:05:16.750> test<00:05:17.139> how<00:05:17.440> do<00:05:17.830> we<00:05:18.449> how<00:05:19.449> do<00:05:19.509> we<00:05:19.660> know<00:05:19.810> if

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:20.020 
a color test how do we how do we know if

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:22.890 
a color test how do we how do we know if
the<00:05:20.259> if<00:05:20.560> the<00:05:20.710> color<00:05:20.949> is<00:05:21.039> yellow<00:05:21.310> or<00:05:21.820> orange<00:05:21.910> or

00:05:22.890 --> 00:05:22.900 
the if the color is yellow or orange or

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:25.980 
the if the color is yellow or orange or
red<00:05:23.080> so<00:05:23.979> he<00:05:24.669> advised<00:05:25.000> that<00:05:25.330> we<00:05:25.419> use<00:05:25.630> test

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:25.990 
red so he advised that we use test

00:05:25.990 --> 00:05:28.980 
red so he advised that we use test
strips<00:05:26.380> so<00:05:26.889> if<00:05:27.370> anybody<00:05:27.729> out<00:05:27.759> there<00:05:27.880> has<00:05:28.690> done

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:28.990 
strips so if anybody out there has done

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:32.029 
strips so if anybody out there has done
that<00:05:29.169> on<00:05:29.320> a<00:05:29.349> phytoplankton<00:05:29.800> grow<00:05:30.490> let<00:05:31.030> me<00:05:31.150> know

00:05:32.029 --> 00:05:32.039 
that on a phytoplankton grow let me know

00:05:32.039 --> 00:05:34.320 
that on a phytoplankton grow let me know
my<00:05:33.039> biggest<00:05:33.280> thing<00:05:33.610> that<00:05:33.639> I'm<00:05:33.880> worried<00:05:34.210> about

00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:34.330 
my biggest thing that I'm worried about

00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:38.490 
my biggest thing that I'm worried about
is<00:05:34.979> phosphates<00:05:36.030> because<00:05:37.030> if<00:05:37.960> I<00:05:38.110> remember

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:38.500 
is phosphates because if I remember

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:46.290 
is phosphates because if I remember
right<00:05:38.919> there<00:05:39.880> is<00:05:42.180> 7%<00:05:44.370> phosphate<00:05:45.370> in<00:05:45.610> here<00:05:46.000> one

00:05:46.290 --> 00:05:46.300 
right there is 7% phosphate in here one

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:50.700 
right there is 7% phosphate in here one
point<00:05:46.479> to<00:05:46.690> nitrogen<00:05:47.199> and<00:05:47.650> nitrate<00:05:48.449> so<00:05:49.710> that's

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:50.710 
point to nitrogen and nitrate so that's

00:05:50.710 --> 00:05:56.800 
point to nitrogen and nitrate so that's
a<00:05:50.919> percentage<00:05:51.580> on<00:05:53.490> let's<00:05:54.490> see

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:56.810 
a percentage on let's see

00:05:56.810 --> 00:05:58.629 
a percentage on let's see
I<00:05:56.870> guess<00:05:57.560> that's<00:05:57.770> the<00:05:57.860> whole<00:05:57.950> nine<00:05:58.310> point

00:05:58.629 --> 00:05:58.639 
I guess that's the whole nine point

00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:02.189 
I guess that's the whole nine point
eight<00:05:58.790> ounces

00:06:02.189 --> 00:06:02.199 

00:06:02.199 --> 00:06:06.779 

so<00:06:02.830> that's<00:06:03.009> all<00:06:03.310> of<00:06:03.520> it<00:06:03.909> so<00:06:04.240> 7%<00:06:05.279> I'd<00:06:06.279> have<00:06:06.490> to<00:06:06.669> do

00:06:06.779 --> 00:06:06.789 
so that's all of it so 7% I'd have to do

00:06:06.789 --> 00:06:10.739 
so that's all of it so 7% I'd have to do
the<00:06:06.819> math<00:06:07.120> on<00:06:07.710> basically<00:06:08.710> one<00:06:09.490> milliliter<00:06:09.849> but

00:06:10.739 --> 00:06:10.749 
the math on basically one milliliter but

00:06:10.749 --> 00:06:13.950 
the math on basically one milliliter but
it's<00:06:10.930> a<00:06:11.020> pretty<00:06:11.259> low<00:06:11.469> amount<00:06:11.860> so<00:06:12.569> I'm<00:06:13.569> not<00:06:13.719> too

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:13.960 
it's a pretty low amount so I'm not too

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:15.869 
it's a pretty low amount so I'm not too
concerned<00:06:14.409> about<00:06:14.560> that<00:06:14.740> another<00:06:15.310> thing<00:06:15.610> too

00:06:15.869 --> 00:06:15.879 
concerned about that another thing too

00:06:15.879 --> 00:06:17.939 
concerned about that another thing too
is<00:06:15.909> while<00:06:16.389> the<00:06:16.569> phytoplankton<00:06:16.960> is<00:06:17.469> growing

00:06:17.939 --> 00:06:17.949 
is while the phytoplankton is growing

00:06:17.949 --> 00:06:21.140 
is while the phytoplankton is growing
that<00:06:18.520> number<00:06:18.969> is<00:06:19.029> going<00:06:19.210> to<00:06:19.270> continue<00:06:19.629> to<00:06:19.840> drop

00:06:21.140 --> 00:06:21.150 
that number is going to continue to drop

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:26.580 
that number is going to continue to drop
substantially<00:06:22.680> so<00:06:24.449> maybe<00:06:25.449> what<00:06:26.050> I<00:06:26.080> need<00:06:26.319> to<00:06:26.439> do

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:26.590 
substantially so maybe what I need to do

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:29.309 
substantially so maybe what I need to do
is<00:06:26.770> get<00:06:27.069> the<00:06:27.249> test<00:06:27.969> strips<00:06:28.270> I<00:06:28.599> know<00:06:29.050> they're

00:06:29.309 --> 00:06:29.319 
is get the test strips I know they're

00:06:29.319 --> 00:06:31.320 
is get the test strips I know they're
kind<00:06:29.529> of<00:06:29.590> inaccurate<00:06:30.249> but<00:06:30.520> that's<00:06:30.939> the<00:06:31.180> only

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:31.330 
kind of inaccurate but that's the only

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:34.439 
kind of inaccurate but that's the only
way<00:06:31.629> that<00:06:31.659> I<00:06:31.900> would<00:06:32.169> think<00:06:33.090> to<00:06:34.090> be<00:06:34.210> able<00:06:34.300> to

00:06:34.439 --> 00:06:34.449 
way that I would think to be able to

00:06:34.449 --> 00:06:37.110 
way that I would think to be able to
test<00:06:34.779> it<00:06:35.050> and<00:06:35.349> be<00:06:35.499> able<00:06:35.710> to<00:06:35.800> see<00:06:35.979> the<00:06:36.099> color<00:06:36.310> not

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:37.120 
test it and be able to see the color not

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:38.999 
test it and be able to see the color not
in<00:06:37.240> a<00:06:37.300> vial<00:06:37.539> but<00:06:37.810> on<00:06:37.930> a<00:06:37.960> strip<00:06:38.379> so<00:06:38.650> we'll<00:06:38.860> do

00:06:38.999 --> 00:06:39.009 
in a vial but on a strip so we'll do

00:06:39.009 --> 00:06:40.709 
in a vial but on a strip so we'll do
that<00:06:39.189> on<00:06:39.460> one<00:06:39.550> of<00:06:39.879> the<00:06:39.939> batches<00:06:40.300> that<00:06:40.449> I<00:06:40.479> have

00:06:40.709 --> 00:06:40.719 
that on one of the batches that I have

00:06:40.719 --> 00:06:42.480 
that on one of the batches that I have
in<00:06:40.839> the<00:06:40.930> fridge<00:06:41.169> that's<00:06:41.560> completely<00:06:42.069> black

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:42.490 
in the fridge that's completely black

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:45.689 
in the fridge that's completely black
and<00:06:43.379> I'll<00:06:44.379> go<00:06:44.589> ahead<00:06:44.680> and<00:06:44.919> post<00:06:45.069> this<00:06:45.279> video<00:06:45.490> on

00:06:45.689 --> 00:06:45.699 
and I'll go ahead and post this video on

00:06:45.699 --> 00:06:47.969 
and I'll go ahead and post this video on
YouTube<00:06:46.479> and<00:06:46.719> then<00:06:46.930> we'll<00:06:47.080> do<00:06:47.169> a<00:06:47.199> follow<00:06:47.560> up<00:06:47.680> on

00:06:47.969 --> 00:06:47.979 
YouTube and then we'll do a follow up on

00:06:47.979 --> 00:06:50.700 
YouTube and then we'll do a follow up on
this<00:06:48.189> and<00:06:48.249> I'll<00:06:48.490> post<00:06:48.789> a<00:06:48.969> link<00:06:49.150> below<00:06:49.449> so<00:06:49.870> let
