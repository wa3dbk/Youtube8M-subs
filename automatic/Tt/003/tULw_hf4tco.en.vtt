 precious tips for you to achieve 

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:13.530

 You because I 'm an ambitious person. 

00:00:15.599 --> 00:00:20.670
 but I've already been an extremely 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.400
 anxious and I was once a person that my 

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.630
 anxiety she took me to hell already 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.670
 I told you 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:29.429
 had panic attacks one behind the 

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:31.500
 Other and I lived with that. 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:34.230
 thank god not for long because 

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:37.290
 My treatment, thanks God. 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:40.020
 Right, I really dedicated myself. 

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.160
 treatment then if I got over you 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.309
 can also 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:47.570
 so come on, the first step is 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:50.789
 recognize and accept your own fears 

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:52.579
 We acknowledge and accept the 

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:55.710
 things you are afraid of 

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:57.600
 according to whether the anxiety is bringing 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.430
 damage to your life 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:02.520
 it's time for you to get help 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:04.769
 I've always been an anxious person. 

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:06.720
 but I just looked for medical help with 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:10.490
 anxiety really messed up the 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.930
 my life I only stayed in the hospital 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:14.909
 thinking that I was going to die I wanted to have a 

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.710
 heart attack I was going to have an avc that 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:18.869
 I was going to have this and that 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.759
 I should have sought out many 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.409
 years ago when I already saw that I was 

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:24.090
 an anxious person but it was not what 

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.150
 happened to me but I hope it is 

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.130
 what will happen to you because at 

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:31.979
 Sometimes many people only seek help 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:35.700
 her degree of anxiety 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:37.860
 led them to the good end should be the 

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.509
 treatment of the disorder of 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.880
 anxiety should be regarded as 

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.649
 any against the disease I do not know 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.509
 Why, but people still have not 

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.490
 I take many serious psychological illnesses 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.829
 especially someone who has never passed 

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.290
 so I think everything is fresh everything 

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:54.780
 bullshit but the very people who the 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.490
 Sometimes they go through this they do not take 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.350
 very seriously the treatment of the people 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.530
 believes and there are a lot of people 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:04.200
 to start taking medicine and to and not 

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.450
 talk to the doctor so if you want 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:09.739
 really get rid of 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:12.170
 that go seek medical attention and follow 

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:13.489
 everything the doctor says everything your 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.920
 screen, I'll tell you 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:19.370
 the exercises she gives you do with 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.000
 dedication because only you can do for 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.800
 you 

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.630
 no one in the world will be able to heal 

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.769
 not to be yourself because it is a 

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:28.550
 disease that is here 

00:02:24.769 --> 00:02:31.280
 inside your good mind do not be ashamed 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:33.920
 nor against your problem I do not need 

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:35.629
 speak in people youtube inter knows 

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.989
 I have panic syndrome I passed 

00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:41.540
 That's why I did not hide from anyone my 

00:02:38.989 --> 00:02:43.579
 problem and do not be ashamed do not 

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:45.829
 shame because many people 

00:02:43.579 --> 00:02:48.799
 In fact, if a percentage of the population 

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:51.440
 suffer one day say 25 percent of the 

00:02:48.799 --> 00:02:52.880
 population has psychological problems 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:56.030
 so you do not need to be ashamed 

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.890
 this is a disease like any other 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.680
 only it is a sometimes invisible disease 

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:02.569
 people can not see you but you 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:04.940
 You have what is as well a part of 

00:03:02.569 --> 00:03:07.280
 season you are not closed no more 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:09.280
 Do you have a psychological problem then? 

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:12.769
 do not hide it do not try to hide 

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:14.630
 because the more you open up the 

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:16.730
 people will try to help you 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:18.019
 and more you will be helped and when 

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.269
 I opened that I had a problem with 

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:22.639
 panic syndrome I was greatly helped 

00:03:20.269 --> 00:03:25.310
 People I received from the world of Santa Catarina 

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:29.090
 of people living on a monitor 

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:31.280
 receive books I received help and thanks to 

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:33.560
 God, I'm healed today, I can say that 

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:36.920
 I 've been healed for a long time. 

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:38.900
 I do not feel any more, I think almost two 

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:40.940
 I do not even feel anything anymore. 

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.170
 my anxiety diminished in a way 

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:44.420
 absurd 

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:46.250
 Today I live better than I used to. 

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:49.130
 To tell the truth to you. 

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:50.900
 and even if I have some period of 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:53.329
 anxiety nowadays I already know how 

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:56.359
 control good 

00:03:53.329 --> 00:03:58.670
 seek support from others who 

00:03:56.359 --> 00:04:00.950
 Your illness is the same as you. 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:03.109
 I say a lot has the syndrome group 

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:07.459
 panic I'm part of facebook that 

00:04:03.109 --> 00:04:09.530
 It's daniel who opened it so not 

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:11.269
 I only have this group has several groups 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:13.230
 so I think you have to look 

00:04:11.269 --> 00:04:15.150
 support and sometimes even 

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:17.100
 talking to people who spend time with 

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:19.229
 that you pass because it is an exchange of 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:21.690
 experience you do not feel 

00:04:19.229 --> 00:04:23.310
 That stranger in the nest knows which ones 

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:24.960
 I who suffered from this did not 

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:27.810
 there you will know that many others 

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:30.150
 people also suffer from the same 

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:32.370
 you suffer you exchange experience than 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:33.210
 these people are doing to 

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:36.320
 heal 

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:38.729
 I think this is super valid is 

00:04:36.320 --> 00:04:39.900
 participate in the process for your 

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:42.120
 recovery 

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:45.620
 do the exercises that the therapist 

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:48.360
 then propose people if you do therapy is 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:50.340
 who watches the longest I remember when 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:53.430
 I recorded on my other one on my other 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:55.710
 house that had several tickets through the house 

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:57.810
 person asked danny that this is mine. 

00:04:55.710 --> 00:05:02.460
 therapist ordered the whole house 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:05:04.680
 where I could a sentence that is I am the 

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:06.810
 that I do what I feel and what I 

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:10.169
 I think I'm in control of my 

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:12.840
 I remember that the whole house and 

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:15.300
 when I was beginning to something me 

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:18.330
 I already thought 'no I'm in control 

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:23.430
 To my mind I control myself. 

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:25.740
 feel and do what I want is not the 

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:28.289
 mind is going to do what she wants me to do 

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:29.880
 tell me giving terrible thoughts 

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:32.099
 These things I 'm not going to do what I 

00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:34.470
 I want and I actually managed to control 

00:05:32.099 --> 00:05:37.620
 enough to my mind with this today I 

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:38.970
 I think I have not going to speak in full 

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:41.130
 I do not know if anyone has a 

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:43.200
 full control of the mind but I have 

00:05:41.130 --> 00:05:46.280
 quite a control of my mind I 

00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:49.050
 I always did the exercise the breathing is 

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:52.620
 diaphragm even when I was not in 

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:54.240
 crisis and because I did because I 

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:56.070
 I was thinking about an hour of a crisis, I'm going 

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:59.700
 know how to act and was really what 

00:05:56.070 --> 00:06:01.860
 happened but the kids were know 

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:05.849
 taking more and more space 

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:10.110
 until she disappears, do not 

00:06:05.849 --> 00:06:12.000
 waiting for the alive symptoms only wins the 

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:14.639
 fear who faces 

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:18.150
 no one can do it for you 

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:20.099
 people really sadly just go 

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:22.169
 overcome the fear you face 

00:06:20.099 --> 00:06:24.479
 You'll have to face your fears. 

00:06:22.169 --> 00:06:26.050
 no use you're afraid of cheap goes 

00:06:24.479 --> 00:06:28.300
 have to stay cheap everything 

00:06:26.050 --> 00:06:31.120
 You can run away but I say 

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:34.300
 so we go in normal life 

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:35.830
 Are you afraid to drive and then do you? 

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:38.470
 lives far away 

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:40.780
 if you have to drive to work 

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:42.490
 no buses do not have training 

00:06:40.780 --> 00:06:44.379
 This will ruin your life if it 

00:06:42.490 --> 00:06:45.370
 You drive before because you're scared. 

00:06:44.379 --> 00:06:47.440
 to direct 

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:49.180
 and you're only going to drive again if you 

00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:51.849
 face that fear 

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:53.560
 okay you never addressed but directed 

00:06:51.849 --> 00:06:56.740
 You have to catch the bus to get 

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:59.349
 but I loathe entrance of the 

00:06:56.740 --> 00:07:00.729
 bus but you'll have to get you 

00:06:59.349 --> 00:07:02.710
 you will have to face your fear of a 

00:07:00.729 --> 00:07:06.719
 bus for you to work to see 

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:10.180
 if the bread of the day and believe the people 

00:07:06.719 --> 00:07:12.729
 told weeks you face it or 

00:07:10.180 --> 00:07:14.650
 at least until you're already on the bus 

00:07:12.729 --> 00:07:17.080
 You're afraid because that's what happened. 

00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:17.919
 With me I faced the bus in front and 

00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:20.199
 subway 

00:07:17.919 --> 00:07:24.430
 I faced the fear of driving and today I 

00:07:20.199 --> 00:07:26.250
 I do everything then who can beat the 

00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:30.639
 your fear is you 

00:07:26.250 --> 00:07:32.889
 well I want to make a video too 

00:07:30.639 --> 00:07:35.650
 talking about diet for people 

00:07:32.889 --> 00:07:38.349
 is born of panic because there are many 

00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:40.810
 foods that they can speed up or 

00:07:38.349 --> 00:07:43.300
 calm people but this is going to be chat 

00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:46.210
 for an upcoming video, I'll go 

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:49.090
 spend a few foods that I think 

00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:52.240
 they calm and some food that they 

00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:53.740
 accelerate and I think this is super 

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:56.259
 interesting for you 

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:59.199
