Joe<00:01:53.959> so<00:01:54.259> this<00:01:54.409> is<00:01:54.560> definitely<00:01:54.709> one<00:01:55.039> of<00:01:55.069> a<00:01:55.189> kind

00:01:55.209 --> 00:01:55.219 
Joe so this is definitely one of a kind

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:56.830 
Joe so this is definitely one of a kind
I<00:01:55.640> believe<00:01:56.000> that<00:01:56.149> there<00:01:56.270> is<00:01:56.299> only<00:01:56.479> five<00:01:56.810> of

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
I believe that there is only five of

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.870 
I believe that there is only five of
these<00:01:57.049> made<00:01:57.349> it's<00:01:57.649> a<00:01:57.709> personal<00:01:58.159> art<00:01:58.340> project

00:01:58.870 --> 00:01:58.880 
these made it's a personal art project

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.520 
these made it's a personal art project
and<00:01:59.000> I'm<00:01:59.060> very<00:01:59.240> lucky<00:01:59.479> to<00:01:59.750> own<00:01:59.869> one<00:02:00.109> well<00:02:00.380> let's

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
and I'm very lucky to own one well let's

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:02.199 
and I'm very lucky to own one well let's
open<00:02:00.619> it<00:02:01.090> ever

00:02:02.199 --> 00:02:02.209 
open it ever

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:04.389 
open it ever
now<00:02:03.049> this<00:02:03.200> Soundwave<00:02:03.619> interpretation<00:02:04.250> looks

00:02:04.389 --> 00:02:04.399 
now this Soundwave interpretation looks

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:05.800 
now this Soundwave interpretation looks
like<00:02:04.520> you<00:02:04.579> would<00:02:04.670> fit<00:02:04.909> right<00:02:05.270> in<00:02:05.450> with<00:02:05.629> like

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:05.810 
like you would fit right in with like

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:07.569 
like you would fit right in with like
the<00:02:05.929> Cobra<00:02:06.140> team<00:02:06.469> yeah<00:02:06.829> exactly<00:02:06.950> you<00:02:07.459> know

00:02:07.569 --> 00:02:07.579 
the Cobra team yeah exactly you know

00:02:07.579 --> 00:02:10.210 
the Cobra team yeah exactly you know
it's<00:02:07.789> GI<00:02:08.060> Joe<00:02:08.299> scale<00:02:08.660> it's<00:02:08.959> reusing<00:02:09.799> GI<00:02:09.979> Joe

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
it's GI Joe scale it's reusing GI Joe

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.009 
it's GI Joe scale it's reusing GI Joe
parts<00:02:10.640> the<00:02:10.879> concept<00:02:11.360> of<00:02:11.420> this<00:02:11.540> line<00:02:11.810> was

00:02:12.009 --> 00:02:12.019 
parts the concept of this line was

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:13.839 
parts the concept of this line was
really<00:02:12.230> shrinking<00:02:13.220> down<00:02:13.400> the<00:02:13.640> massive

00:02:13.839 --> 00:02:13.849 
really shrinking down the massive

00:02:13.849 --> 00:02:15.580 
really shrinking down the massive
transformers<00:02:14.720> and<00:02:14.959> what<00:02:15.140> would<00:02:15.290> they<00:02:15.410> look

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:15.590 
transformers and what would they look

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.080 
transformers and what would they look
like<00:02:15.650> in<00:02:16.010> a<00:02:16.069> three<00:02:16.340> and<00:02:16.430> three-quarter<00:02:16.910> inch

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:17.090 
like in a three and three-quarter inch

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:18.550 
like in a three and three-quarter inch
scale<00:02:17.360> so<00:02:17.629> if<00:02:17.780> you<00:02:17.870> were<00:02:17.989> to<00:02:18.079> sell<00:02:18.290> this<00:02:18.319> how

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:18.560 
scale so if you were to sell this how

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:20.440 
scale so if you were to sell this how
much<00:02:18.680> would<00:02:18.829> you<00:02:18.860> sell<00:02:19.069> work<00:02:19.370> I<00:02:19.549> couldn't<00:02:20.299> part

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
much would you sell work I couldn't part

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.030 
much would you sell work I couldn't part
with<00:02:20.540> it<00:02:20.720> I'm<00:02:20.900> sure<00:02:20.959> it's<00:02:21.379> worth<00:02:21.500> hundreds<00:02:21.950> of

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:22.040 
with it I'm sure it's worth hundreds of

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.479 
with it I'm sure it's worth hundreds of
dollars

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:22.489 
dollars

for<00:02:24.349> more<00:02:24.500> info<00:02:25.190> these<00:02:25.700> are<00:02:25.910> arguably<00:02:26.359> the

00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:26.450 
for more info these are arguably the

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.050 
for more info these are arguably the
most<00:02:26.900> hated<00:02:27.290> sub<00:02:27.799> series<00:02:28.220> of<00:02:28.400> transformers

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
most hated sub series of transformers

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:30.520 
most hated sub series of transformers
they're<00:02:29.239> called<00:02:29.450> action<00:02:29.930> masters

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:30.530 
they're called action masters

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:32.289 
they're called action masters
I<00:02:30.560> think<00:02:30.859> people<00:02:31.010> genuinely<00:02:31.579> hated<00:02:32.030> the<00:02:32.120> fact

00:02:32.289 --> 00:02:32.299 
I think people genuinely hated the fact

00:02:32.299 --> 00:02:33.729 
I think people genuinely hated the fact
that<00:02:32.420> these<00:02:32.629> didn't<00:02:33.049> transform

00:02:33.729 --> 00:02:33.739 
that these didn't transform

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:35.740 
that these didn't transform
it's<00:02:33.980> called<00:02:34.250> transformers<00:02:34.910> you<00:02:35.030> expect<00:02:35.450> some

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:35.750 
it's called transformers you expect some

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.080 
it's called transformers you expect some
level<00:02:35.959> of<00:02:36.290> interchangeability<00:02:37.040> yeah<00:02:37.700> no

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:38.090 
level of interchangeability yeah no

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:39.670 
level of interchangeability yeah no
kidding<00:02:38.420> but<00:02:38.660> I<00:02:38.690> gotta<00:02:38.900> tell<00:02:39.079> you<00:02:39.200> I<00:02:39.319> love

rad<00:02:40.579> was<00:02:40.910> the<00:02:41.060> very<00:02:41.329> first<00:02:41.450> one<00:02:41.840> that<00:02:41.900> I<00:02:42.109> had<00:02:42.440> he

00:02:42.849 --> 00:02:42.859 
rad was the very first one that I had he

00:02:42.859 --> 00:02:44.620 
rad was the very first one that I had he
looks<00:02:43.099> like<00:02:43.220> a<00:02:43.280> very<00:02:43.459> rad<00:02:43.790> dude<00:02:44.060> you<00:02:44.299> can<00:02:44.450> see

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:44.630 
looks like a very rad dude you can see

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.050 
looks like a very rad dude you can see
totally<00:02:45.590> not<00:02:45.769> bogus<00:02:46.010> it<00:02:46.459> was<00:02:46.579> part<00:02:46.940> of<00:02:46.970> the

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.060 
totally not bogus it was part of the

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:49.000 
totally not bogus it was part of the
same<00:02:47.180> set<00:02:47.420> not<00:02:48.109> part<00:02:48.500> of<00:02:48.530> the<00:02:48.620> same<00:02:48.769> set<00:02:48.980> but

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:49.010 
same set not part of the same set but

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:50.890 
same set not part of the same set but
each<00:02:49.280> figure<00:02:49.639> came<00:02:49.910> with<00:02:50.120> a<00:02:50.150> little<00:02:50.389> sidekick

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:50.900 
each figure came with a little sidekick

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.870 
each figure came with a little sidekick
animal<00:02:51.290> that<00:02:51.470> would<00:02:51.620> also<00:02:51.769> transform<00:02:52.609> into<00:02:52.730> a

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:52.880 
animal that would also transform into a

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:54.819 
animal that would also transform into a
weapon<00:02:53.269> really<00:02:53.450> so<00:02:53.900> while<00:02:54.169> they're<00:02:54.380> limited

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:54.829 
weapon really so while they're limited

00:02:54.829 --> 00:02:56.920 
weapon really so while they're limited
in<00:02:54.950> articulation<00:02:55.819> and<00:02:56.060> the<00:02:56.120> Scopes<00:02:56.630> aren't

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:56.930 
in articulation and the Scopes aren't

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:58.420 
in articulation and the Scopes aren't
particularly<00:02:57.260> dynamic<00:02:57.859> and<00:02:58.069> they<00:02:58.250> don't

00:02:58.420 --> 00:02:58.430 
particularly dynamic and they don't

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:00.190 
particularly dynamic and they don't
transform<00:02:58.819> there's<00:02:59.269> still<00:02:59.480> something<00:02:59.750> really

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:00.200 
transform there's still something really

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.229 
transform there's still something really
quite<00:03:00.769> magical<00:03:00.919> about<00:03:01.310> these<00:03:01.549> definitely<00:03:02.120> in

00:03:02.229 --> 00:03:02.239 
quite magical about these definitely in

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:03.550 
quite magical about these definitely in
bulk<00:03:02.480> if<00:03:02.690> you<00:03:02.810> had<00:03:02.900> like<00:03:03.049> a<00:03:03.109> bunch<00:03:03.319> of<00:03:03.410> them

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
bulk if you had like a bunch of them

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.620 
bulk if you had like a bunch of them
just<00:03:03.739> like<00:03:03.980> stand<00:03:04.280> up<00:03:04.459> first<00:03:04.790> like<00:03:05.120> in<00:03:05.239> a<00:03:05.269> pile

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:05.630 
just like stand up first like in a pile

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:07.690 
just like stand up first like in a pile
there<00:03:06.169> are<00:03:06.260> really<00:03:06.560> not<00:03:06.769> that<00:03:06.950> bad<00:03:07.160> but<00:03:07.400> I<00:03:07.579> can

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:07.700 
there are really not that bad but I can

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.490 
there are really not that bad but I can
understand<00:03:08.120> why<00:03:08.329> transformers<00:03:09.139> fans<00:03:09.349> were

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:09.500 
understand why transformers fans were
