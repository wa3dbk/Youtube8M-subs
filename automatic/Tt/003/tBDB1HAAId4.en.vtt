know when the beta first came out it was

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.950

discovered<00:00:38.430> that<00:00:38.730> this<00:00:39.000> thing<00:00:39.329> was<00:00:39.660> a

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
discovered that this thing was a

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.069 
discovered that this thing was a
absolute<00:00:40.739> beast<00:00:41.270> it<00:00:42.270> was<00:00:42.510> a<00:00:42.540> one-shot<00:00:43.020> kill

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
absolute beast it was a one-shot kill

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:46.340 
absolute beast it was a one-shot kill
from<00:00:43.710> pretty<00:00:44.340> much<00:00:44.489> the<00:00:44.730> waist<00:00:45.000> up<00:00:45.360> it<00:00:45.750> had<00:00:46.079> no

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:46.350 
from pretty much the waist up it had no

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.709 
from pretty much the waist up it had no
recoil<00:00:46.770> and<00:00:47.100> had<00:00:47.489> 20<00:00:47.820> bullets<00:00:48.149> by<00:00:48.270> default

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
recoil and had 20 bullets by default

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.950 
recoil and had 20 bullets by default
what<00:00:48.960> an<00:00:49.050> incredible<00:00:49.950> rail<00:00:50.129> fire<00:00:50.460> and<00:00:51.300> uh<00:00:51.539> I

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:51.960 
what an incredible rail fire and uh I

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.590 
what an incredible rail fire and uh I
don't<00:00:52.199> think<00:00:52.680> they<00:00:52.829> ever<00:00:52.980> intended<00:00:53.550> to<00:00:53.600> have

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:54.600 
don't think they ever intended to have

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:58.400 
don't think they ever intended to have
the<00:00:55.280> dragon<00:00:56.280> be<00:00:56.399> that<00:00:56.579> strong<00:00:57.230> because<00:00:58.230> they

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
the dragon be that strong because they

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.229 
the dragon be that strong because they
nerfed<00:00:58.620> it<00:00:58.829> I<00:00:59.010> mean<00:00:59.460> this<00:00:59.640> patch<00:00:59.879> that<00:01:00.059> came

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:00.239 
nerfed it I mean this patch that came

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:02.869 
nerfed it I mean this patch that came
out<00:01:00.449> earlier<00:01:00.660> today<00:01:01.230> was<00:01:02.160> it<00:01:02.309> earlier<00:01:02.399> today<00:01:02.850> I

00:01:02.869 --> 00:01:02.879 
out earlier today was it earlier today I

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.830 
out earlier today was it earlier today I
think<00:01:03.270> last<00:01:03.480> night<00:01:04.339> they<00:01:05.339> nerfed<00:01:05.970> the<00:01:06.360> Drake

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:06.840 
think last night they nerfed the Drake

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.300 
think last night they nerfed the Drake
into<00:01:07.380> shit<00:01:08.390> it's<00:01:09.390> pretty<00:01:09.659> much<00:01:09.810> unusable<00:01:10.320> in

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:11.310 
into shit it's pretty much unusable in

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.160 
into shit it's pretty much unusable in
my<00:01:11.520> opinion<00:01:11.880> because<00:01:12.240> you<00:01:12.270> know<00:01:12.570> I<00:01:12.600> just<00:01:12.930> I

something like that where it's not like

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.510 
something like that where it's not like
a<00:01:25.140> body<00:01:25.470> multiplier<00:01:26.040> it's<00:01:26.189> gonna<00:01:26.310> get<00:01:26.460> a

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:26.520 
a body multiplier it's gonna get a

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.050 
a body multiplier it's gonna get a
one-shot<00:01:26.820> kill

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:27.060 
one-shot kill

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:29.660 
one-shot kill
I<00:01:27.210> don't<00:01:28.049> want<00:01:28.350> to<00:01:28.439> use<00:01:28.530> a<00:01:28.560> sniper<00:01:28.860> that

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:29.670 
I don't want to use a sniper that

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:31.670 
I don't want to use a sniper that
doesn't<00:01:30.270> get<00:01:30.390> me<00:01:30.509> that<00:01:30.659> you<00:01:31.170> know<00:01:31.259> I<00:01:31.320> can<00:01:31.530> use<00:01:31.650> a

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:31.680 
doesn't get me that you know I can use a

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.670 
doesn't get me that you know I can use a
red<00:01:32.549> gun<00:01:32.790> that<00:01:33.060> could<00:01:33.360> kill<00:01:33.720> in<00:01:33.900> 3<00:01:34.110> bullets

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
red gun that could kill in 3 bullets

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.069 
red gun that could kill in 3 bullets
that<00:01:35.549> shoots<00:01:35.850> insanely<00:01:36.360> fast<00:01:36.630> you<00:01:36.869> know<00:01:36.960> what

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:37.079 
that shoots insanely fast you know what

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.980 
that shoots insanely fast you know what
I<00:01:37.140> mean<00:01:37.290> so<00:01:37.850> in<00:01:38.850> my<00:01:39.030> opinion<00:01:39.390> the<00:01:39.479> Dracon<00:01:39.869> is

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990 
I mean so in my opinion the Dracon is

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.319 
I mean so in my opinion the Dracon is
pretty<00:01:40.200> much<00:01:40.350> useless<00:01:40.619> sniper<00:01:41.070> now<00:01:41.340> I<00:01:41.610> think

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
pretty much useless sniper now I think

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.719 
pretty much useless sniper now I think
they<00:01:42.509> went<00:01:42.750> at<00:01:42.960> it<00:01:43.020> the<00:01:43.380> wrong<00:01:43.560> way<00:01:43.590> if<00:01:44.460> it<00:01:44.700> was

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729 
they went at it the wrong way if it was

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:47.389 
they went at it the wrong way if it was
up<00:01:44.970> to<00:01:45.000> me<00:01:45.210> I<00:01:45.450> think<00:01:45.570> I<00:01:45.899> would<00:01:46.079> have<00:01:46.170> nerfed<00:01:46.590> the

00:01:47.389 --> 00:01:47.399 
up to me I think I would have nerfed the

00:01:47.399 --> 00:01:50.090 
up to me I think I would have nerfed the
rate<00:01:47.610> of<00:01:47.759> fire<00:01:47.939> a<00:01:48.090> ton<00:01:48.450> I<00:01:48.689> would<00:01:49.140> added<00:01:49.799> more

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
rate of fire a ton I would added more

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.399 
rate of fire a ton I would added more
recoil<00:01:50.579> and<00:01:51.119> I<00:01:51.540> would<00:01:51.689> have<00:01:51.780> left<00:01:51.930> it<00:01:52.079> damage

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
you know what I mean like the rate of

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:05.330 
you know what I mean like the rate of
fire<00:02:02.520> was<00:02:02.729> was<00:02:03.570> it<00:02:04.049> was<00:02:04.259> really<00:02:04.560> good<00:02:04.890> and<00:02:05.159> it

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
fire was was it was really good and it

fire was was it was really good and it
was<00:02:05.430> still<00:02:05.700> like<00:02:05.880> a<00:02:05.909> one-shot<00:02:06.420> kill<00:02:06.450> from<00:02:07.320> like

to be like of

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.290 
to be like of
fortunately<00:02:13.830> it's<00:02:13.980> more<00:02:14.190> like<00:02:14.340> an<00:02:14.460> M<00:02:14.580> 21<00:02:14.940> for

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
fortunately it's more like an M 21 for

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:17.780
