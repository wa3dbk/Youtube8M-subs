00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:49.660 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:52.600 

fans<00:00:50.660> can<00:00:51.140> become<00:00:51.560> a<00:00:51.590> part<00:00:51.890> of<00:00:52.040> the<00:00:52.190> crew<00:00:52.430> the

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:52.610 
fans can become a part of the crew the

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:55.540 
fans can become a part of the crew the
minute<00:00:52.880> they<00:00:53.000> log<00:00:53.210> in<00:00:53.450> and<00:00:53.920> they<00:00:54.920> go<00:00:55.130> out<00:00:55.280> on

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:55.550 
minute they log in and they go out on

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:57.970 
minute they log in and they go out on
real-world<00:00:55.910> missions<00:00:56.390> so<00:00:56.960> it's<00:00:57.110> pretty<00:00:57.710> fun

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:57.980 
real-world missions so it's pretty fun

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.520 
real-world missions so it's pretty fun
yeah<00:00:58.400> it's<00:00:58.640> the<00:00:58.850> hero<00:00:59.059> making<00:00:59.540> out<00:00:59.690> I<00:00:59.960> like<00:01:00.290> it

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:00.530 
yeah it's the hero making out I like it

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:02.979 
yeah it's the hero making out I like it
so<00:01:00.739> so<00:01:01.610> the<00:01:01.760> way<00:01:01.790> that<00:01:01.879> that<00:01:02.180> thing<00:01:02.540> works<00:01:02.780> its

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:02.989 
so so the way that that thing works its

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:05.020 
so so the way that that thing works its
Qualcomm<00:01:03.800> is<00:01:03.950> new<00:01:04.129> context<00:01:04.790> awareness

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:05.030 
Qualcomm is new context awareness

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:06.790 
Qualcomm is new context awareness
platform<00:01:05.690> yeah<00:01:05.990> and<00:01:06.200> it<00:01:06.290> makes<00:01:06.500> all<00:01:06.680> those

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:06.800 
platform yeah and it makes all those

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.650 
platform yeah and it makes all those
features<00:01:07.130> possible<00:01:07.820> and<00:01:07.940> what<00:01:08.060> it<00:01:08.180> does<00:01:08.360> is<00:01:08.420> it

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:08.660 
features possible and what it does is it

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:11.170 
features possible and what it does is it
lets<00:01:09.020> this<00:01:09.170> app<00:01:09.470> sort<00:01:10.160> of<00:01:10.220> adapt<00:01:10.550> to<00:01:10.850> the<00:01:10.940> user

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:11.180 
lets this app sort of adapt to the user

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.870 
lets this app sort of adapt to the user
surroundings<00:01:12.080> and<00:01:12.320> so<00:01:12.530> the<00:01:13.100> app<00:01:13.280> can<00:01:13.580> actually

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:13.880 
surroundings and so the app can actually

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.050 
surroundings and so the app can actually
detect<00:01:14.270> when<00:01:14.570> a<00:01:14.600> mission<00:01:14.869> is<00:01:15.020> completed<00:01:15.500> using

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:16.060 
detect when a mission is completed using

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:20.520 
detect when a mission is completed using
combination<00:01:17.060> of<00:01:17.240> audio<00:01:17.990> scan<00:01:18.410> or<00:01:18.860> geolocation

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:20.530 
combination of audio scan or geolocation

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:23.650 
combination of audio scan or geolocation
identification<00:01:21.530> or<00:01:21.800> image<00:01:22.700> recognition<00:01:22.970> and

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:23.660 
identification or image recognition and

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:26.020 
identification or image recognition and
this<00:01:24.560> app<00:01:24.800> it's<00:01:25.310> actually<00:01:25.399> the<00:01:25.640> first<00:01:25.820> one

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
this app it's actually the first one

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:27.460 
this app it's actually the first one
that's<00:01:26.210> used<00:01:26.390> all<00:01:26.690> three<00:01:27.170> of<00:01:27.200> these

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:27.470 
that's used all three of these

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.290 
that's used all three of these
technologies<00:01:27.890> together<00:01:28.310> in<00:01:28.640> our<00:01:28.729> gimbal<00:01:29.090> plop

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:29.300 
technologies together in our gimbal plop

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:31.389 
technologies together in our gimbal plop
if<00:01:29.570> you're<00:01:29.750> near<00:01:30.080> a<00:01:30.110> billboard<00:01:30.530> like<00:01:31.100> the<00:01:31.250> app

00:01:31.389 --> 00:01:31.399 
if you're near a billboard like the app

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:33.249 
if you're near a billboard like the app
will<00:01:31.670> tell<00:01:31.910> you<00:01:32.090> if<00:01:32.420> you<00:01:32.539> just<00:01:32.750> go<00:01:32.899> over<00:01:33.020> there

00:01:33.249 --> 00:01:33.259 
will tell you if you just go over there

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:35.440 
will tell you if you just go over there
then<00:01:33.500> it's<00:01:34.039> quite<00:01:34.220> cool<00:01:34.430> it's<00:01:34.610> like<00:01:34.789> an<00:01:34.940> Easter

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:35.450 
then it's quite cool it's like an Easter

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:37.450 
then it's quite cool it's like an Easter
egg<00:01:35.479> hunt<00:01:35.780> uses<00:01:36.410> this<00:01:36.590> very<00:01:36.920> low-power

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:37.460 
egg hunt uses this very low-power

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.690 
egg hunt uses this very low-power
location<00:01:38.119> technology<00:01:38.360> so<00:01:39.320> this<00:01:39.530> geofence<00:01:40.460> the

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:40.700 
location technology so this geofence the

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:41.980 
location technology so this geofence the
thing<00:01:40.910> that<00:01:41.090> tells<00:01:41.330> you<00:01:41.539> when<00:01:41.660> you're<00:01:41.780> near

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:41.990 
thing that tells you when you're near

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:43.900 
thing that tells you when you're near
things<00:01:42.320> or<00:01:42.590> inside<00:01:43.340> a<00:01:43.369> place<00:01:43.670> that

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:43.910 
things or inside a place that

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:45.880 
things or inside a place that
capabilities<00:01:44.780> always<00:01:45.110> on<00:01:45.350> and<00:01:45.619> so<00:01:45.740> what<00:01:45.860> that

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:45.890 
capabilities always on and so what that

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.520 
capabilities always on and so what that
means<00:01:46.340> is<00:01:46.550> that<00:01:46.610> fans<00:01:47.390> can<00:01:47.630> auto<00:01:47.929> complete

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:48.530 
means is that fans can auto complete

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:49.690 
means is that fans can auto complete
their<00:01:48.710> mission<00:01:49.100> I<00:01:49.190> mean<00:01:49.310> they<00:01:49.369> don't<00:01:49.460> even

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
their mission I mean they don't even

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:50.950 
their mission I mean they don't even
have<00:01:49.850> to<00:01:49.940> take<00:01:50.119> their<00:01:50.270> smartphone<00:01:50.720> out<00:01:50.810> of

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
have to take their smartphone out of

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.530 
have to take their smartphone out of
their<00:01:51.050> pocket<00:01:51.440> to<00:01:51.590> do<00:01:51.740> it<00:01:51.920> so<00:01:52.550> the<00:01:52.910> app<00:01:53.090> just

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:53.540 
their pocket to do it so the app just

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.140 
their pocket to do it so the app just
