boardroom today we're going to talk
about<00:00:14.680> thin<00:00:15.099> setups<00:00:15.549> so<00:00:15.820> the<00:00:16.299> four<00:00:16.599> most

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:16.869 
about thin setups so the four most

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:19.200 
about thin setups so the four most
popular<00:00:16.960> types<00:00:17.529> of<00:00:17.710> fin<00:00:17.890> setups<00:00:18.279> are<00:00:18.430> the

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:19.210 
popular types of fin setups are the

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:22.230 
popular types of fin setups are the
single<00:00:19.570> fin<00:00:19.750> the<00:00:20.470> twin<00:00:20.740> fin<00:00:21.009> the<00:00:21.669> three<00:00:22.060> fin

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:22.240 
single fin the twin fin the three fin

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:23.940 
single fin the twin fin the three fin
thruster<00:00:22.720> and<00:00:22.750> my<00:00:23.140> personal<00:00:23.500> favorite<00:00:23.770> the

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:23.950 
thruster and my personal favorite the

00:00:23.950 --> 00:00:25.560 
thruster and my personal favorite the
quad<00:00:24.490> now

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:25.570 
quad now

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:27.060 
quad now
I've<00:00:25.750> lined<00:00:26.200> these<00:00:26.380> up<00:00:26.529> in<00:00:26.710> this<00:00:26.859> matter

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:27.070 
I've lined these up in this matter

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:29.250 
I've lined these up in this matter
because<00:00:27.519> the<00:00:28.240> prominence<00:00:28.750> of<00:00:28.900> these<00:00:29.080> fin

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:29.260 
because the prominence of these fin

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:30.300 
because the prominence of these fin
setups<00:00:29.619> are<00:00:29.769> basically<00:00:30.130> sitting

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:30.310 
setups are basically sitting

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:32.070 
setups are basically sitting
chronologically<00:00:30.970> here<00:00:31.179> that's<00:00:31.660> the<00:00:31.929> single

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:32.080 
chronologically here that's the single

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:33.600 
chronologically here that's the single
fin<00:00:32.320> was<00:00:32.470> kind<00:00:32.590> of<00:00:32.650> the<00:00:32.739> first<00:00:33.010> popular<00:00:33.460> fin

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:33.610 
fin was kind of the first popular fin

fin was kind of the first popular fin
setup<00:00:33.760> that<00:00:33.940> there<00:00:34.090> was<00:00:34.239> the<00:00:34.690> twin<00:00:34.930> fin<00:00:35.110> was

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:35.290 
setup that there was the twin fin was

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:37.229 
setup that there was the twin fin was
released<00:00:35.620> after<00:00:36.160> that<00:00:36.519> the<00:00:36.879> three<00:00:37.089> fin

00:00:37.229 --> 00:00:37.239 
released after that the three fin

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:39.060 
released after that the three fin
thruster<00:00:37.750> was<00:00:37.870> made<00:00:38.050> popular<00:00:38.290> by<00:00:38.500> Simon

thruster was made popular by Simon

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:41.250 
thruster was made popular by Simon
Anderson<00:00:39.460> in<00:00:39.970> the<00:00:40.089> early<00:00:40.600> 80s<00:00:40.900> and<00:00:41.019> then<00:00:41.170> the

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:41.260 
Anderson in the early 80s and then the

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.469 
Anderson in the early 80s and then the
quad<00:00:41.470> has<00:00:42.010> become<00:00:42.339> very<00:00:42.519> popular<00:00:42.729> more

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:43.479 
quad has become very popular more

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:46.469 
quad has become very popular more
recently<00:00:43.839> now<00:00:44.970> I'm<00:00:45.970> just<00:00:46.210> going<00:00:46.330> to<00:00:46.420> go

excepted pluses and minuses of each fin

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.350 
excepted pluses and minuses of each fin
setup<00:00:50.650> everyone<00:00:51.640> has<00:00:51.760> kind<00:00:51.850> of<00:00:51.940> a<00:00:52.030> personal

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:52.360 
setup everyone has kind of a personal

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:53.939 
setup everyone has kind of a personal
preference<00:00:52.570> again<00:00:52.900> I<00:00:53.049> really<00:00:53.440> like<00:00:53.589> the<00:00:53.710> quad

00:00:53.939 --> 00:00:53.949 
preference again I really like the quad

00:00:53.949 --> 00:00:56.009 
preference again I really like the quad
setup<00:00:54.280> I<00:00:54.400> like<00:00:54.610> like<00:00:55.000> for<00:00:55.239> the<00:00:55.299> speed<00:00:55.600> and<00:00:55.839> kind

00:00:56.009 --> 00:00:56.019 
setup I like like for the speed and kind

00:00:56.019 --> 00:00:58.140 
setup I like like for the speed and kind
of<00:00:56.110> maneuverability<00:00:56.440> I<00:00:57.339> don't<00:00:57.699> do<00:00:57.850> a<00:00:57.879> lot<00:00:58.000> of

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:58.150 
of maneuverability I don't do a lot of

00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:59.310 
of maneuverability I don't do a lot of
fancy<00:00:58.360> maneuvers<00:00:58.780> or<00:00:58.809> anything<00:00:58.989> like<00:00:59.140> that<00:00:59.229> I

00:00:59.310 --> 00:00:59.320 
fancy maneuvers or anything like that I

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:00.719 
fancy maneuvers or anything like that I
like<00:00:59.530> going<00:00:59.710> fast<00:00:59.920> and<00:01:00.129> I<00:01:00.190> like<00:01:00.339> doing<00:01:00.460> big

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:00.729 
like going fast and I like doing big

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:02.039 
like going fast and I like doing big
power<00:01:00.970> turns<00:01:01.239> and<00:01:01.390> things<00:01:01.510> like<00:01:01.600> that<00:01:01.659> so<00:01:01.809> the

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:02.049 
power turns and things like that so the

00:01:02.049 --> 00:01:04.350 
power turns and things like that so the
quad<00:01:02.260> seems<00:01:02.500> to<00:01:02.619> work<00:01:02.799> best<00:01:02.979> for<00:01:03.070> me<00:01:03.280> now<00:01:04.000> the

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:04.360 
quad seems to work best for me now the

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.420 
quad seems to work best for me now the
single<00:01:04.600> fin<00:01:04.930> is<00:01:05.199> I<00:01:05.590> would<00:01:05.799> say<00:01:05.979> out<00:01:06.159> of<00:01:06.280> these

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:06.430 
single fin is I would say out of these

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:07.710 
single fin is I would say out of these
four<00:01:06.729> probably<00:01:07.030> has<00:01:07.210> the<00:01:07.299> biggest<00:01:07.390> cult

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:07.720 
four probably has the biggest cult

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:09.030 
four probably has the biggest cult
following<00:01:08.140> you<00:01:08.229> see<00:01:08.380> a<00:01:08.409> lot<00:01:08.560> of<00:01:08.590> single<00:01:08.799> fins

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:09.040 
following you see a lot of single fins

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.740 
following you see a lot of single fins
on<00:01:09.159> long<00:01:09.340> boards<00:01:09.700> and<00:01:09.850> things<00:01:09.909> like<00:01:10.090> that<00:01:10.150> but

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:10.750 
on long boards and things like that but

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:12.539 
on long boards and things like that but
there's<00:01:10.930> also<00:01:11.110> you<00:01:11.920> know<00:01:11.979> boards<00:01:12.369> like<00:01:12.490> this

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:12.549 
there's also you know boards like this

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:15.539 
there's also you know boards like this
this<00:01:13.030> Haden<00:01:13.659> shapes<00:01:13.869> cannon<00:01:14.740> which<00:01:15.250> is<00:01:15.369> kind

00:01:15.539 --> 00:01:15.549 
this Haden shapes cannon which is kind

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:17.940 
this Haden shapes cannon which is kind
of<00:01:15.579> a<00:01:15.700> more<00:01:15.880> modern<00:01:16.390> single<00:01:16.719> fin<00:01:16.869> and<00:01:17.079> it's

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:17.950 
of a more modern single fin and it's

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:19.620 
of a more modern single fin and it's
been<00:01:18.070> modernized<00:01:18.520> for<00:01:18.670> the<00:01:19.000> kind<00:01:19.179> of<00:01:19.240> new<00:01:19.390> rage

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:19.630 
been modernized for the kind of new rage

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:22.020 
been modernized for the kind of new rage
now<00:01:20.259> the<00:01:20.320> single<00:01:20.590> fin<00:01:20.890> is<00:01:21.130> great<00:01:21.579> for<00:01:21.850> holding

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:22.030 
now the single fin is great for holding

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:25.039 
now the single fin is great for holding
a<00:01:22.359> line<00:01:22.570> and<00:01:22.899> great<00:01:23.350> for<00:01:23.530> generating<00:01:23.920> speed

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:25.049 
a line and great for generating speed

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:28.169 
a line and great for generating speed
but<00:01:26.049> it<00:01:26.350> doesn't<00:01:26.829> and<00:01:27.369> sorry<00:01:27.640> when<00:01:27.999> I<00:01:28.030> say

00:01:28.169 --> 00:01:28.179 
but it doesn't and sorry when I say

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:30.899 
but it doesn't and sorry when I say
generating<00:01:28.600> speed<00:01:28.719> for<00:01:29.229> from<00:01:29.890> going<00:01:30.219> fast<00:01:30.520> but

00:01:30.899 --> 00:01:30.909 
generating speed for from going fast but

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:32.459 
generating speed for from going fast but
it<00:01:31.090> doesn't<00:01:31.420> generate<00:01:31.719> speed<00:01:31.960> as<00:01:32.079> easily<00:01:32.229> as

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:32.469 
it doesn't generate speed as easily as

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:34.469 
it doesn't generate speed as easily as
as<00:01:32.649> perhaps<00:01:33.100> a<00:01:33.219> twin<00:01:33.460> fin<00:01:33.670> or<00:01:33.880> a<00:01:33.909> thruster<00:01:34.329> work

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:34.479 
as perhaps a twin fin or a thruster work

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:36.749 
as perhaps a twin fin or a thruster work
or<00:01:34.719> even<00:01:34.960> a<00:01:35.020> quad<00:01:35.229> you<00:01:35.979> kind<00:01:36.369> of<00:01:36.399> have<00:01:36.520> take

00:01:36.749 --> 00:01:36.759 
or even a quad you kind of have take

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:38.039 
or even a quad you kind of have take
more<00:01:37.060> of<00:01:37.119> the<00:01:37.210> energy<00:01:37.450> that<00:01:37.600> the<00:01:37.689> wave<00:01:37.810> gives

00:01:38.039 --> 00:01:38.049 
more of the energy that the wave gives

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:40.440 
more of the energy that the wave gives
you<00:01:38.229> and<00:01:38.439> and<00:01:39.369> so<00:01:39.579> you<00:01:39.880> know<00:01:39.969> I<00:01:40.060> think<00:01:40.299> some

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.450

twin fin was introduced to be really
quick<00:01:52.299> and<00:01:52.479> lively<00:01:53.020> and<00:01:53.170> that's<00:01:53.979> exactly<00:01:54.219> what

00:01:54.419 --> 00:01:54.429 
quick and lively and that's exactly what

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:56.669 
quick and lively and that's exactly what
it<00:01:54.520> is<00:01:54.670> the<00:01:55.210> downside<00:01:55.689> of<00:01:55.719> the<00:01:55.990> twin<00:01:56.200> fin<00:01:56.409> these

00:01:56.669 --> 00:01:56.679 
it is the downside of the twin fin these

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:58.050 
it is the downside of the twin fin these
are<00:01:56.799> really<00:01:57.100> really<00:01:57.189> fast<00:01:57.460> forwards<00:01:57.850> but<00:01:57.969> the

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:58.060 
are really really fast forwards but the

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:00.660 
are really really fast forwards but the
downside<00:01:58.389> is<00:01:58.600> they<00:01:59.079> are<00:01:59.829> a<00:01:59.889> little<00:02:00.399> bit<00:02:00.490> loose

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
downside is they are a little bit loose

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:02.249 
downside is they are a little bit loose
and<00:02:00.850> they<00:02:01.060> do<00:02:01.119> tend<00:02:01.450> to<00:02:01.539> spin<00:02:01.929> out<00:02:02.049> a<00:02:02.079> little

00:02:02.249 --> 00:02:02.259 
and they do tend to spin out a little

00:02:02.259 --> 00:02:03.660 
and they do tend to spin out a little
bit<00:02:02.439> so<00:02:02.649> if<00:02:02.710> you're<00:02:02.829> doing<00:02:03.009> a<00:02:03.069> big<00:02:03.189> bottom<00:02:03.490> turn

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:13.340 
like that I'm just not that type of

like that I'm just not that type of
surfer<00:03:13.700> I'm<00:03:13.760> a<00:03:13.850> big<00:03:14.030> guy<00:03:14.180> and<00:03:14.390> I<00:03:14.480> like<00:03:14.630> going

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:14.810 
surfer I'm a big guy and I like going

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:16.600 
surfer I'm a big guy and I like going
fast<00:03:15.140> I<00:03:15.350> like<00:03:15.470> doing<00:03:15.680> big<00:03:15.860> power<00:03:16.100> carves<00:03:16.520> and

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:16.610 
fast I like doing big power carves and

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:18.640 
fast I like doing big power carves and
therefore<00:03:17.600> the<00:03:17.690> quad<00:03:17.870> setup<00:03:18.140> seems<00:03:18.350> to<00:03:18.470> suit

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:18.650 
therefore the quad setup seems to suit

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:20.470 
therefore the quad setup seems to suit
me<00:03:18.770> the<00:03:18.860> best<00:03:19.040> the<00:03:19.280> quads<00:03:19.520> are<00:03:19.940> generally<00:03:20.360> very

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:20.480 
me the best the quads are generally very

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:22.000 
me the best the quads are generally very
fast<00:03:20.810> they<00:03:21.020> could<00:03:21.140> still<00:03:21.380> do<00:03:21.500> kind<00:03:21.710> of<00:03:21.740> tight

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
fast they could still do kind of tight

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.250 
fast they could still do kind of tight
you<00:03:22.220> know<00:03:22.340> type<00:03:23.060> pivoting<00:03:23.690> terms<00:03:23.930> but<00:03:24.110> they're

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:24.260 
you know type pivoting terms but they're

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:25.900 
you know type pivoting terms but they're
great<00:03:24.530> too<00:03:24.770> when<00:03:24.950> you<00:03:25.070> really<00:03:25.400> lay<00:03:25.730> it<00:03:25.820> on

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:25.910 
great too when you really lay it on
