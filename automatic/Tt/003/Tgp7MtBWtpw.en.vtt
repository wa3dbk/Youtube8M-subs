00:00:02.179 --> 00:00:05.100
 hi welcome to you on facebook 

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:07.649
 cooking then today we end up 

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.139
 in company two with cgil dropped 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:12.120
 new design so here I am 

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:14.190
 a little bit in the middle of two barracks 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.920
 and then I decided to show them 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.630
 that we can make fast-food breast or 

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:20.250
 less the healthiest possible 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:22.199
 so let's go for a recipe of 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.119
 nuggets lighten up so for the 

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.640
 ingredients it's very healthy go ahead 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:29.039
 egg two chicken cutlets 100 g of 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.750
 flour and 100 g of muscular cereal and 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:33.210
 after you can smoke a little bit of 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.489
 desert paprika salt and pepper 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.050
 part the sgo so to start it's 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:39.090
 really very simple there we have the mixture 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.890
 of eight beds so that we will try to 

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.120
 mix as best you can if you do not 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.770
 no mixer you can of course the 

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.649
 to do with a knife then after having 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.160
 added the preparation h and in a 

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:50.190
 plate 

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:53.879
 we come to put the flour and there we see 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:59.370
 well seasoned with pepper 

00:00:53.879 --> 00:01:02.430
 paprika and those with herbs 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:03.930
 mix well once you 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.330
 have finished you will be able to add 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.790
 a dose of tasteless protein and 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:11.010
 then we will not lead the nuggets 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.810
 so for cooking nuggets like 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.369
 it's light we'll take a sheet of 

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:15.659
 aluminum foil and we'll add a 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.200
 little oil 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:20.220
 I recommend olive oil 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.630
 so now we're not going to be born 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.909
 chickens so that's very simple 

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.460
 you take the pieces of nuggets 

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:28.829
 we just put a shot in the 

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:30.240
 flour then once in the egg 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:32.189
 I added a little bit of milk 

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.640
 but it's not obligatory you 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:34.920
 deceived 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.470
 here is the nugget in this preparation 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.119
 we come back in the flour 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.450
 and you 're going to do it again 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:43.770
 and we will be able to go to cooking 

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:46.770
 so let's go for cooking so 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.780
 we will do this in the oven at 180 Â° 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.299
 about 15 minutes and then you can 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:52.680
 return to half cooking and add 

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.659
 a little oil if you want to get 

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.420
 a crispy crust 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.340
 so that's it here is the result we have 

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.899
 really pretty nagat I will try 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.900
 to show you that look hands 

00:02:00.899 --> 00:02:03.979
 who is coming 

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:06.619
 we have a breadcrumb that looks like a little 

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:08.479
 little of kfc breadcrumbs so I find 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:15.250
 that sounds very good we can 

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:19.370
 enjoy at the e10 is gone in barrels 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:20.720
 on jimmy no frankly I like 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:22.040
 alright but I think it can be 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.900
 really very very good with a little bit of 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.250
 sauce so if there is opportunity to eat 

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:28.880
 that and that he has average years 

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:30.380
 maybe ketchup house type thuraya 

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.340
 but I find it nice and worse 

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.569
 it's not bad but frankly the 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.180
 same meaning to the second I find it very 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:38.090
 well finally I'm not sure Jerome 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.500
 car so here I hope that the 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:41.000
 recipe you even more if it's the case 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.130

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.140
 comment and then I hope especially that 

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:46.610
 the rosette will want more at the top of the 

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:48.410
 top super good but in any case it's a 

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:48.890
 recipe that I will redo with great 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:50.600
