00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.689
 hello welcome to this second 

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.850
 video about light sources 

00:00:03.689 --> 00:00:08.490
 colorful and in this capsule we get 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.650
 proposes to make a focus in particular 

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.599
 on the winne law before returning 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.420
 in the heart of the subject I propose a 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:17.520
 little parenthesis on the notion of body 

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.840
 black which is not required in first s 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.570
 but which is important to be able to 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:23.100
 talk about the car while she's 

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.930
 black body it is a hypothetical object 

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:28.080
 which absorbs all the radiation it 

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:30.420
 receives and who is able rey and m 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:32.660
 the intensity more or less great and the 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.660
 influence 

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:37.450
 electromagnetic emission of the 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.080
 black body functions that his 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:39.730
 temperature 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:41.800
 so this definition on a little bit 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:42.940
 esoteric and yet there are many 

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:47.290
 objects whose behavior 

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:50.530
 is like a black body already in 1792 

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:52.330
 the british wedgewood service with 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:54.190
 find that when they placed 

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:56.590
 objects in an oven it's up to the game 

00:00:54.190 --> 00:01:00.420
 became red at the same time as 

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:03.280
 oven walls and that whatever 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:04.420
 whatever the form of objects which 

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.120
 whatever the size whatever the 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.740
 trunk in materials then the question 

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:12.220
 that we will ask ourselves will be a little 

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:14.110
 red thread issue of this short it's going 

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:15.970
 to be what there is a connection between the 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:19.930
 temperature of a hot body a body 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:23.770
 who heats and who heats like like 

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:27.130
 sun for example a star the film in 

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:30.040
 a lamp a metal that we go for example 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.090
 blush and its color is what there is a 

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:31.630
 link between the temperature still hot 

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.370
 and this color 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.780
 so to be able to answer that 

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:37.360
 question we are going to need a 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:40.689
 device called a spectrum at the m 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:43.180
 this device is for example like the one 

00:01:40.689 --> 00:01:45.310
 this is composed includes a particular 

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:46.990
 tip that is an optical fiber 

00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.450
 this optical fiber we will guide it 

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:53.380
 to a white light source by 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:55.149
 example here and via the interface we're going 

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:59.020
 to be able to obtain a particular graphic 

00:01:55.149 --> 00:02:00.609
 this graph and corresponds to what he 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:02.649
 corresponds to the luminous intensity emitted 

00:02:00.609 --> 00:02:03.159
 by source according to the length 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:07.270
 wave 

00:02:03.159 --> 00:02:09.360
 here we recognize of course so we have a 

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:12.850
 polychromatic light source but 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.920
 spectral intensity adversity 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:16.570
 really maximum is a 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:20.110
 length of waves formerly in the 

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:21.790
 in the yellow pretty much so here this 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:24.940
 graph type is called is called 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:27.010
 a spectral profile 

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:28.660
 do not be confused with this kind of figure 

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:29.380
 what kind of figure how do we do it 

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.700
 to get it 

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:33.970
 remember it was the object of the 

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:36.070
 previous video we take a source of 

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:37.570
 light for example to white light the 

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:40.150
 emitted light is sent on a 

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:42.610
 spectroscope typically composed of a 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:45.850
 prism or network and we get a 

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:47.500
 figure called a spectrum so here 

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:49.150
 the spectral profile is interesting 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.380
 because it may allow us to 

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.150
 make a connection between temperature of a 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.760
 body and color color 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:57.760
 finally it's neither more nor less nor 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:00.220
 no more or less the wavelength a 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:03.130
 object in the emptiness of the color of our 

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.390
 feet in the vacuum then what is 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:05.650
 happens if I take several bodies 

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:06.730
 black not wait on different 

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.460
 in other words if we take several 

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:10.800
 hot body that we will heat to 

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:14.590
 different temperatures 

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:17.740
 well here's if we take black body to 

00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:20.380
 6000 Kelvin the kelvin it's a are 

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:20.980
 soon as the degree Celsius at the 

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:23.020
 fahrenheit 

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:24.400
 to make it short to pass as soon 

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:25.780
 that she lives in to grease on if 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.610
 you just have to cut off three hundred 

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:32.739
 in other words 6000 Kelvin it's about 

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:34.630
 5700 degrees Celsius so it's pretty much 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:36.640
 like the temperatures at which one 

00:03:34.630 --> 00:03:39.130
 so places themselves if they are hot 

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:41.500
 an object we see that its peak 

00:03:39.130 --> 00:03:42.850
 maximum intensity corresponds to a 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.950
 wavelength roughly in the 

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:46.830
 yellow on the other hand now if we 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:50.070
 still takes a little less 

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:52.710
 heat only to 5000 density 

00:03:50.070 --> 00:03:54.690
 maximum 1 its peak 

00:03:52.710 --> 00:03:56.430
 so maximum attention to a length 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:03:57.150
 wave that is a little bit higher and 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:59.730
 so on 

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:02.640
 we can take the reading of the graph 

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:06.590
 in the opposite direction plus temperature 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:09.930
 a hot body is important 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:13.380
 3000 4000 5000 6000 plus length 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:17.220
 wave corresponding to the intensity peak 

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:21.150
 maximum becomes a little and moves 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:24.330
 to the blue in other words the body 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:26.700
 hot little its temperature increases more 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:29.100
 its spectrum is enriched in blue and well 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:30.690
 apparently we understand that there is 

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:32.310
 maybe here a link between temperature 

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:35.100
 more colors the body is hot 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:39.390
 the more its spectrum is enriched in blue eh 

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:41.970
 well these vines that will put that under 

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:44.100
 mathematical form we will start deaths 

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:46.880
 spectrum profits with warm decor and 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:50.340
 well he'll tell us the next thing 

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:54.180
 when the body temperature decreases 

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:56.610
 wavelength of intensity peaks 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:59.280
 bigger increases so that 

00:04:56.610 --> 00:05:01.320
 the product of both always remains equal 

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:02.700
 at a constant value well know do not 

00:05:01.320 --> 00:05:05.800
 to learn of course in general it's 

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:08.259
 provided in the statement and 

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:10.629
 it will not be the law of emptiness that makes us 

00:05:08.259 --> 00:05:12.699
 a link is a model that makes us a 

00:05:10.629 --> 00:05:14.650
 only model of the link between temptation 

00:05:12.699 --> 00:05:17.860
 of a warm body and its color as 

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:20.860
 promised how to pass temperatures 

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:24.729
 kelvin in gold 7 sus and well all 

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:25.180
 simply by adding 273.15 degrees 

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:27.099
 celsius 

00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:29.430
 indeed both this formula 1 

00:05:27.099 --> 00:05:31.479
 today the temperature is in Kelvin 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:34.659
 and the wavelength 

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:36.340
 coinciding with peak of maximum intensity 

00:05:34.659 --> 00:05:39.780
 is time m that's the reason for 

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:42.250
 which this constant and in m kelvin 

00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:44.500
 so we can not it would be a pity to 

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:46.800
 to leave without getting a little 

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:49.090
 challenge well here it is 

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:49.479
 I give you a spectral profile of a 

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:51.550
 star 

00:05:49.479 --> 00:05:54.219
 find me the temperature in training 

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:56.530
 knew this star knowing that the 

00:05:54.219 --> 00:05:58.090
 temperature here the wavelength 

00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:00.039
 sorry here it's ten power minus 10 

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:01.960
 m so these four thousand ten power 

00:06:00.039 --> 00:06:03.159
 least 10 four thousand five hundred and ten 

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:04.210
 power minus 10 

00:06:03.159 --> 00:06:06.430
 it's a thousand exempts less than 10 

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:08.259
 meters etc I leave you master and 

00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:11.650
 video on break do you not grant more 

00:06:08.259 --> 00:06:13.690
 of three minutes including a minute for 

00:06:11.650 --> 00:06:15.279
 find the calculator of course and then 

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:20.529
 after you raise the video for everything 

00:06:15.279 --> 00:06:22.120
 see the correct here is I guess 

00:06:20.529 --> 00:06:26.409
 so you have an answer element 

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:28.120
 to confront with the correct of course 

00:06:26.409 --> 00:06:31.719
 at first will locate the 

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:33.370
 maximum wavelength of the yielding wedge 

00:06:31.719 --> 00:06:36.750
 forgiveness with peak of maximum 

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:41.469
 of intensity to the ladle that corresponds to 

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:42.219
 4750 10 - 10 m of course we will use 

00:06:41.469 --> 00:06:44.229
 the law 

00:06:42.219 --> 00:06:45.909
 of witte what interests me is the 

00:06:44.229 --> 00:06:48.460
 temperature at first we go 

00:06:45.909 --> 00:06:51.099
 write the literal expression then we go 

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:54.219
 fa the digital app thinking about 

00:06:51.099 --> 00:06:56.680
 to convert 10 - 10 m we will find a 

00:06:54.219 --> 00:06:58.180
 result in kelvin and to make 

00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:00.039
 the equivalent 100 degrees celsius he 

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:01.029
 Just take away the famous 200th 

00:07:00.039 --> 00:07:03.279
 are 13 15 

00:07:01.029 --> 00:07:05.020
 so we can still wear a 

00:07:03.279 --> 00:07:06.069
 critical look at all these numbers 

00:07:05.020 --> 00:07:09.729
 significant 

00:07:06.069 --> 00:07:11.229
 however here there are four numbers 

00:07:09.729 --> 00:07:12.639
 again there are four numbers 

00:07:11.229 --> 00:07:13.840
 significant 

00:07:12.639 --> 00:07:15.610
 so it's legitimate to put a 

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:18.300
 result with four digits 

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:18.300
 significant
