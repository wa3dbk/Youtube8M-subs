00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.390
 good 

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:27.320
 hello friends in today's tutorial I'm going 

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:30.580
 to show how we can get a 

00:00:27.320 --> 00:00:33.550
 console and public 

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:36.040
 The first thing we should do is to get 

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.950
 on this website where I'll leave you a 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:40.390
 link in the video description 

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.520
 you will have to look at the last one 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:46.150
 there is his life exactly should we get out 

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:48.160
 in the 4th post since the other three are 

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:50.920
 links from web administrators 

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:53.710
 to give us information 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:55.659
 the normal thing is that we see an icon 

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:58.210
 of shots and the work of the last 

00:00:55.659 --> 00:01:00.820
 rise but since some user 

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:05.379
 share one we'll see how the icon will 

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:07.690
 it turns green and tells us online we access 

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:09.729
 she clicking on the link and we 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:13.090
 we go directly to the final part 

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:14.979
 of the message where he tells us to quote for 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.439
 leave a comment and let us see the 

00:01:14.979 --> 00:01:20.200
 spoiler for this we should be 

00:01:17.439 --> 00:01:24.399
 registered on the web if we can not 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:26.979
 respond to the message once we finish 

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:30.610
 to write we click on answer and already 

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:33.190
 will show our response now we go up 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:42.130
 at the beginning of the host and click on the 

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:44.530
 spoiler icon here is the 

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:47.500
 consolidate and we will only have to copy the 

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:51.009
 we mark the numbering and we give the 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:53.500
 right and click on copy now 

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:55.899
 we must open the file with solidity 

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.820
 point txt and I will leave you in the description 

00:01:55.899 --> 00:02:00.070
 if we replace one 

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:04.479
 on the other marking the old one and giving 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:07.570
 to hit many of you will happen 

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:10.570
 that by copying and linking the web and not 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:13.980
 the idea but do not worry this is 

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:16.420
 can solve in a very easy way 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.950
 we return to the footprint is sometimes I 

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:21.040
 they let copy 

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:23.620
 we mark search and google will make us a 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.959
 search and we can see that in the box 

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.959
 of search is our idea is also 

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:32.530
 we copy from here and this time yes we 

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:34.060
 let you copy it into the file once 

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:35.709
 let's finish hitting our idea 

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:38.860
 we will save the changes and we will 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:41.760
 our file with solid point txt in 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:44.040
 the root of our pendrive 

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.379
 now it only remains to connect our 

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:49.220
 pendrive in the usb slot on the right 

00:02:46.379 --> 00:02:49.220
 in our ps3 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:59.000
 once inside our console 

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:03.130
 we access assignables and press r3 to 

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:06.260
 copy our solidly to our ps3 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:08.330
 we have already changed for this session the 

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.070
 console and now we only have left 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:12.320
 protect our user as we do 

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:15.560
 provided that they are not worth it and we 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:16.970
 our user to protect the console 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:19.390
 we just have to have previously 

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:22.880
 loaded the game that we are going to use 

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:24.680
 loaded with solid manager or last and 

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:29.030
 from that to click on the button 

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:30.920
 triangle and we choose r2 now we go back to 

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:33.200
 press r2 to delete all the files 

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:35.810
 created in our console and sonny null 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:39.620
 from this and we will be ready to 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:42.110
 connect us in the pcm we will also be 

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:44.540
 protecting the solidly so that 

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:46.190
 late minus being banned but from this 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:50.120
 way guarantees and have an idea 

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:52.130
 easily and more lasting as this is 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:54.700
 all for today friends until the next
