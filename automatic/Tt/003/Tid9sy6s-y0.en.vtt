00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.560
 hello with you denis drink drink 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:08.189
 Head mountain section of information you have 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:08.760
 I am often asked what kind of sleeping 

00:00:08.189 --> 00:00:11.880
 bags 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:15.199
 I use myself and so I decided 

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:18.420
 tell me what bags I have and 

00:00:15.199 --> 00:00:21.449
 what kind of sleeping bags are generally at all 

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:25.590
 in nature I have two bedrooms 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:28.859
 downy blanket bags that we 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.150
 use for most hikes 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.899
 medium difficulty 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:38.309
 why downy because they are much 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:42.450
 warmer than synthetic same weight 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.370
 and my wife loves me warmly 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.530
 there are 2 

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:49.800
 ordinary sleeping bag blanket most 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:52.250
 simple cheapest for many years 

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:56.190
 And these two sleeping bags of different companies 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:59.180
 one Moscow other on a la tour on 

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:01.530
 the anise's surprise pulled together and 

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.570
 actually since with our 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:08.420
 wife we live together these two 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:14.010
 sleeping bag ride with us on trips to 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:17.189
 the nature of the format of festivals to the country 

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:20.850
 used as a guest blanket they are not 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:24.890
 used for long hikes 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:28.170
 or for hikes where we carry 

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:31.500
 sleeping bags on themselves because they are a little 

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:34.500
 heavier than other sleeping bags that 

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:37.070
 I have besides this I have 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:40.560
 very light sleeping bag 

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:42.780
 Nova Turovsky Crimea which I use 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.939
 for summer challenging hikes 

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:48.299
 why for summer because this 

00:01:44.939 --> 00:01:50.460
 sleeping bag is cold it is light and cold 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:52.380
 so you can only use in summer 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.979
 I have already shown it in previous 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:56.670
 releases 

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:58.409
 I can't show it now I lent it 

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:01.859
 to your friend 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:06.630
 besides this i have a very warm 

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:09.929
 Cocoon sleeping bag is also downy 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:12.480
 Basque firms canâ€™t show it either 

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:15.420
 because my friend earring 6 is gone 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:19.430
 together with him on the peak of Lenin will return 

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:22.349
 maybe i will review it 

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:25.170
 why such sleeping bags 

00:02:22.349 --> 00:02:26.180
 me and in that amount again 

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.430
 simple 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:32.730
 sleeping bags synthetic blankets 

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.819
 used for picnic to give as 

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.989
 guest blankets 

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:39.060
 Historically, it was 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:41.400
 the first sleeping bags that we 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.379
 bought by his wife and they actually 

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:47.640
 we stayed 

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:49.920
 then we got super light sleeping bags 

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:56.040
 Well, here's one of them as different Turov 

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:58.470
 Crimea but the wife refused to go with them 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:02.160
 it freezes me even in a summer hike 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:04.980
 such a sleeping bag may not be suitable for 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:09.000
 those who love heat so do not chase 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:12.739
 for super weight if you like warmth and 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:15.720
 comfort why downy sleeping bags 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:18.450
 the blanket we use most of our 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:25.349
 hikes even difficult enough because 

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:29.190
 what are they very warm b they are light in 

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:32.780
 they are compact folded games they 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:36.329
 comfortable for sleeping they are very big and 

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:38.340
 together we just have a lot 

00:03:36.329 --> 00:03:44.370
 spaces for relaxation 

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:46.470
 inside the sleeping bags if 

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:48.900
 hot it is possible to unbutton them and 

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:51.030
 use exactly as a blanket to rest 

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:54.329
 with comfort not just like in a bag where you 

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:57.810
 can't bend your knees apostille 1 

00:03:54.329 --> 00:03:59.830
 sleeping bag down and the other hiding from above 

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:04.210
 very comfortable 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:05.800
 and accordingly the last is bags for 

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:08.830
 serious hikes 

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:11.950
 both weight and heat are important there . 

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:13.840
 characteristics it is their combination like 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:15.520
 the rule is i have it enough 

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:19.410
 expensive sleeping bags 

00:04:15.520 --> 00:04:21.970
 Well, except for Crimea 1 lotto 

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:24.900
 Moscow is an expensive sleeping bag but he 

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:29.860
 this money justifies why because 

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:33.790
 he weighs a kilo probably kilogram 

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:35.580
 200 don't exactly remember very compact in 

00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:38.050
 folded much smaller 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:43.500
 synthetic sleeping with the same 

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:47.020
 thermal characteristics and at the same time 

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:49.720
 protects well from virtually any frost 

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:51.360
 which you can meet on a hike 

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:56.680
 eg 

00:04:51.360 --> 00:05:01.660
 extreme hike that was with these 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:04.120
 sleeping bags is a ski trip on the polar 

00:05:01.660 --> 00:05:05.260
 Ural, the temperature there fell to 

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:08.020
 minus 20 

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:10.780
 not much but let's say these were 

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:15.220
 sleeping bags and hiking where it was minus 30 

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:18.040
 and even -40 on this on sleeping bags all with 

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:18.700

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:21.870

 use the right gear 

00:05:21.870 --> 00:05:27.510
