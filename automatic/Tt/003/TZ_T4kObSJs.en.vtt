 I'm going to place her in the microwave 

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:29.320
 for about a minute and a half at 

00:00:27.099 --> 00:00:30.489
 until the butter is melted so 

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.980
 montbard has melted 

00:00:30.489 --> 00:00:36.280
 I will mix to allow occupies 

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:38.080
 of chocolate to melt well while it 

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:43.990
 is still hot I'm going to add the 

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:48.010
 granulated sugar excellent in a second 

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:50.230
 flying I'm going 80 kg and I'm going 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.050
 beat to get a yellow color 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:54.640
 blade 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:56.680
 if the color I want to get 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.490
 I will now add the flour 

00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:03.250
 with baking soda 

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:06.220
 I add my mix of other cola and I 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:09.150
 will mix everything and that's what 

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.150
 the base of our boat 

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:13.979
 I will add three quarter cup of 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:16.880
 flour with water I'm going to buy 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.880
 internally 

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:25.150
 and the device that remained I finished 

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:27.340
 with water I will now take a 

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:30.130
 bowl 10 by 15 by three inch body 

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.880
 thick I'm going to ask of a 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:32.620
 baking coating 

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.750
 afterwards I put a sheet of 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:36.880
 parchment paper and I still put a 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:38.560
 layer of cooking coating this job is 

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.240
 very important is what will we 

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.710
 make it easier to unmould 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.340
 so the mix is ​​still pretty 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:44.860
 liquid 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:49.240
 they want to pour directly into my 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:51.370
 mold I 'm going to relax you slightly 

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:54.280
 even though areva mix is a very very 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:55.960
 alright I'm going to put my cake at 350 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:58.140
 degrees for about 15 minutes or 

00:01:55.960 --> 00:02:00.970
 until the cake is spongy 

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:02.890
 my cake is now cooked I'm going 

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:04.869
 hang it up and with powdered sugar 

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:09.479
 it'll stop him from sticking when 

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:09.479
 see the roll then as it is here 

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:14.470
 excellent I'll cover it with a 

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:17.500
 clean dish cloth that concerns 

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.750
 its moisture like this is using 

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.190
 a baking rack 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:23.320
 I will come and put on my cake 

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:25.330
 like to hot plate I will use a 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:28.720
 ton of cooking and I'm going to return the 

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:36.480
 cake on the grill delicately like 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:39.370
 this is I'm going to remove the plate 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:43.150
 so delicately I will remove the 

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:45.430
 parchment paper with the rim of the 

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.230
 towel I will collect his sedan 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:49.690
 earthly like that I'm going to roll towards 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:50.320
 the front while still exercising a small 

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:53.440
 pressure 

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:56.000
 [Music] 

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:57.980
 excellent i'm going to positions on the 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.470
 toasting and I will leave the cake 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.700
 cool completely 

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:04.190
 I will now prepare the filling 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:06.290
 of cheese that validates the cake then 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:08.959
 in a nice game but half a pack of 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:10.790
 cream cheese is 125 years old and I 

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:12.739
 will whip him also if your 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:14.540
 image is already softened it's going to be easy 

00:03:12.739 --> 00:03:23.180
 a mixture was to add sugar in 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:24.709
 powder and I'm going to whip again I 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:27.019
 I will add whipping to it 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:29.239
 so a cup and a half with the filling 

00:03:27.019 --> 00:03:32.470
 whipping cole whitt is that I get 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:35.269
 a very very very creamy mixture 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:37.880
 now I'm going to roll out my cake 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:43.280
 taking care to detach the walls 

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:44.780
 cake is here so if you see 

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.519
 small cracks like that why 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:48.260
 worried when we will put the 

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:50.299
 interior cheese filling is going 

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.980
 seal the walls of the cake and at the end 

00:03:50.299 --> 00:03:53.780
 with the ganache we will cover everything 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:56.049
 there is none to invite you who is going to 

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:56.049
 realize 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:03.150
 I will wait for the trim part disappointed 

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:06.040
 [Music] 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:08.140
 I like to keep a space at the end of 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:09.879
 about imposes an inch and a half where I 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:11.950
 will not put any toppings that will prevent 

00:04:09.879 --> 00:04:14.769
 overwhelmed and there with a spatula elbow and 

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:16.680
 I'm going to turn off this preparation of 

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:19.630
 as uniformly as possible 

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:22.690
 I'm ready to roll then I'm going 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:25.419
 help me with the dish cloth and I 

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:27.850
 go folded the cake on itself as 

00:04:25.419 --> 00:04:30.430
 this here by exerting a slight pressure 

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:31.810
 so do not worry if there are 

00:04:30.430 --> 00:04:35.650
 little cracks they will end up at 

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:39.070
 inside and we will not see them and 

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:41.590
 I had once again delicately and 

00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:45.130
 here is taking care of the hands of 

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:46.990
 place the seal under the rolled cake and 

00:04:45.130 --> 00:04:51.220
 so here I am now going to take 

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:55.139
 a plate of service and I'm going there 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:57.639
 drop my cake rolled over 

00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:59.289
 last step I 'm going to prepare the 

00:04:57.639 --> 00:05:01.720
 ganache that will cover the cake 

00:04:59.289 --> 00:05:04.360
 so in a bowl I put three squares 

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:06.669
 of chocolate b that sweeten me with a 

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:08.410
 cup and a half of gansu and pours out web 

00:05:06.669 --> 00:05:09.940
 I will place it in the microwave oven 

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:11.320
 for about a minute at power 

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:13.960
 high until chocolate is 

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:16.000
 well done I'll now mix 

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:20.320
 for chocolate to melt 

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.520
 perfectly I will let cool 

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:23.169
 completely 

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:25.300
 magan age so that they are more 

00:05:23.169 --> 00:05:27.610
 easy to spread on my cake I have 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:29.470
 already one to prepare in the fridge I'm going 

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:33.430
 extend it using a spatula elbow 

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:36.220
 and so taking care of really well 

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:38.460
 hide all the little ac that he can 

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:39.050
