middle working together with the
engineers<00:02:20.890> and<00:02:21.310> finding<00:02:22.000> new<00:02:22.180> technical

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
engineers and finding new technical

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.100 
engineers and finding new technical
solutions<00:02:23.620> we<00:02:24.090> created<00:02:25.090> this<00:02:25.209> concept<00:02:25.450> of<00:02:25.959> the

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:26.110 
solutions we created this concept of the

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:31.500 
solutions we created this concept of the
transparent<00:02:26.740> antenna<00:02:27.130> I<00:02:30.390> think<00:02:31.390> it's

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:31.510 
transparent antenna I think it's

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:34.830 
transparent antenna I think it's
beautiful<00:02:31.780> when<00:02:32.290> when<00:02:33.130> what<00:02:33.459> we<00:02:33.640> design<00:02:34.060> makes

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
beautiful when when what we design makes

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.780 
beautiful when when what we design makes
it<00:02:34.959> possible<00:02:35.200> for<00:02:35.530> people<00:02:35.709> to<00:02:36.010> do<00:02:36.370> more<00:02:36.580> than

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
it possible for people to do more than

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.370 
it possible for people to do more than
they<00:02:36.940> would<00:02:37.120> otherwise<00:02:37.150> be<00:02:37.570> able<00:02:38.050> to<00:02:38.170> do

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.380 
they would otherwise be able to do

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:41.000 
they would otherwise be able to do
that's<00:02:39.010> when<00:02:39.280> magic<00:02:39.489> happens

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:41.010 
that's when magic happens

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:43.069 
that's when magic happens
