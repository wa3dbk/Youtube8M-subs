alright<00:00:00.329> hello<00:00:00.539> everybody<00:00:00.810> today<00:00:01.410> I'm

00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:01.740 
alright hello everybody today I'm

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.090 
alright hello everybody today I'm
reviewing<00:00:02.060> batteries<00:00:03.060> so<00:00:03.750> these<00:00:04.170> are<00:00:04.589> the

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:05.100 
reviewing batteries so these are the

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.910 
reviewing batteries so these are the
Maha<00:00:05.609> power<00:00:06.089> X<00:00:07.189> batteries<00:00:08.189> now<00:00:08.809> Maha<00:00:09.809> is<00:00:10.110> a<00:00:10.469> I

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:10.920 
Maha power X batteries now Maha is a I

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.220 
Maha power X batteries now Maha is a I
think<00:00:11.219> it's<00:00:11.340> a<00:00:11.460> Taiwanese<00:00:12.120> company<00:00:12.900> so<00:00:13.080> these

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
think it's a Taiwanese company so these

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.039 
think it's a Taiwanese company so these
batteries<00:00:14.070> are<00:00:14.549> made<00:00:14.790> by<00:00:15.000> a<00:00:15.030> taiwan<00:00:15.599> company

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:16.049 
batteries are made by a taiwan company

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:18.590 
batteries are made by a taiwan company
and<00:00:16.320> they<00:00:17.220> make<00:00:17.460> quite<00:00:18.180> a<00:00:18.240> series<00:00:18.570> of

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
and they make quite a series of

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:19.910 
and they make quite a series of
batteries<00:00:18.990> they<00:00:19.140> I<00:00:19.170> think<00:00:19.320> they<00:00:19.590> have<00:00:19.710> the<00:00:19.890> I

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
batteries they I think they have the I

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.790 
batteries they I think they have the I
median<00:00:20.520> and<00:00:20.699> the<00:00:21.180> power<00:00:21.779> axis<00:00:22.170> so<00:00:22.619> the

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:22.800 
median and the power axis so the

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.220 
median and the power axis so the
immediate<00:00:23.220> is<00:00:23.340> basically<00:00:23.670> a<00:00:24.420> lower<00:00:24.900> capacity

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:25.230 
immediate is basically a lower capacity

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:28.670 
immediate is basically a lower capacity
version<00:00:26.010> of<00:00:26.130> the<00:00:26.760> power<00:00:27.180> axis<00:00:27.539> so<00:00:28.019> these<00:00:28.230> are

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:28.680 
version of the power axis so these are

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.220 
version of the power axis so these are
the<00:00:29.580> power<00:00:29.880> X<00:00:30.090> batteries<00:00:30.510> now<00:00:30.750> these<00:00:30.960> have

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:31.230 
the power X batteries now these have

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.100 
the power X batteries now these have
some<00:00:31.439> serious<00:00:32.270> capacity<00:00:33.270> in<00:00:33.420> them<00:00:33.540> now<00:00:33.930> these

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:34.110 
some serious capacity in them now these

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:38.990 
some serious capacity in them now these
are<00:00:34.380> 2<00:00:35.000> 2700<00:00:36.770> milliamp<00:00:37.770> hour<00:00:38.040> double-a

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
are 2 2700 milliamp hour double-a

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.819 
are 2 2700 milliamp hour double-a

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
batteries now that's quite a mouthful

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.110 
batteries now that's quite a mouthful
now<00:00:43.230> as<00:00:43.590> you<00:00:43.680> can<00:00:43.770> notice<00:00:43.950> mine<00:00:44.730> came<00:00:44.910> in<00:00:45.030> quite

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120 
now as you can notice mine came in quite

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.319 
now as you can notice mine came in quite
a<00:00:45.180> big<00:00:45.360> box<00:00:45.600> because<00:00:45.930> I<00:00:46.050> got<00:00:46.680> the<00:00:46.890> charger<00:00:47.460> that

00:00:48.319 --> 00:00:48.329 
a big box because I got the charger that

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:51.380 
a big box because I got the charger that
comes<00:00:48.480> with<00:00:48.719> it<00:00:48.840> I<00:00:49.110> have<00:00:49.440> the<00:00:49.530> MHC<00:00:50.390> 800s

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.390 
comes with it I have the MHC 800s

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.720 
comes with it I have the MHC 800s
charging<00:00:51.989> I'm<00:00:52.110> gonna<00:00:52.289> put<00:00:52.469> the<00:00:52.620> Box<00:00:52.890> aside<00:00:53.070> now

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:53.730 
charging I'm gonna put the Box aside now

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:56.240 
charging I'm gonna put the Box aside now
this<00:00:53.940> is<00:00:54.059> a<00:00:54.090> charger<00:00:54.570> it<00:00:55.079> has<00:00:55.260> eight<00:00:55.469> base<00:00:55.829> so

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250 
this is a charger it has eight base so

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:58.670 
this is a charger it has eight base so
you<00:00:56.280> can<00:00:56.370> charge<00:00:56.760> up<00:00:56.940> to<00:00:57.180> eight<00:00:57.449> double-a<00:00:58.440> or

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
you can charge up to eight double-a or

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.180 
you can charge up to eight double-a or
triple<00:00:59.640> A's<00:01:00.140> simultaneously<00:01:01.170> in<00:01:01.350> the<00:01:01.829> charger

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
triple A's simultaneously in the charger

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:03.500 
triple A's simultaneously in the charger
now<00:01:02.370> what's<00:01:02.579> so<00:01:02.670> special<00:01:02.850> about<00:01:03.059> this<00:01:03.270> now

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
now what's so special about this now

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:05.719 
now what's so special about this now
apart<00:01:03.899> from<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.260> huge<00:01:04.470> capacity<00:01:05.100> I<00:01:05.339> think

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
apart from the huge capacity I think

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.330 
apart from the huge capacity I think
these<00:01:05.880> have<00:01:06.049> larger<00:01:07.049> capacities<00:01:07.560> than<00:01:08.070> the

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:08.340 
these have larger capacities than the

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.250 
these have larger capacities than the
inner<00:01:08.520> loops<00:01:08.880> so<00:01:09.479> I<00:01:09.510> think<00:01:09.750> my<00:01:09.840> under<00:01:10.080> loops

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
inner loops so I think my under loops

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.250 
inner loops so I think my under loops
are<00:01:10.590> about<00:01:11.030> 2400<00:01:12.030> million<00:01:12.270> hours<00:01:12.600> I'm<00:01:12.780> not<00:01:12.810> too

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
are about 2400 million hours I'm not too

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.140 
are about 2400 million hours I'm not too
sure<00:01:13.439> about<00:01:13.470> that<00:01:13.860> but<00:01:14.280> what<00:01:14.430> I<00:01:14.460> am<00:01:14.850> sure<00:01:15.119> is

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150 
sure about that but what I am sure is

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.020 
sure about that but what I am sure is
that<00:01:15.600> these<00:01:15.840> power<00:01:16.080> X's<00:01:16.409> pack<00:01:16.680> a<00:01:16.890> lot<00:01:17.460> more

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:18.030 
that these power X's pack a lot more

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:19.880 
that these power X's pack a lot more
juice<00:01:18.270> in<00:01:18.450> them<00:01:18.600> compared<00:01:19.080> to<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.710> inner

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
juice in them compared to the inner

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.520 
juice in them compared to the inner
loops<00:01:20.250> apart<00:01:21.030> from<00:01:21.390> the<00:01:21.990> large<00:01:22.470> capacity

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:24.530 
loops apart from the large capacity

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.929 
loops apart from the large capacity
another<00:01:25.530> special<00:01:26.009> thing<00:01:26.159> I<00:01:26.280> love<00:01:26.549> about<00:01:26.580> these

00:01:26.929 --> 00:01:26.939 
another special thing I love about these

00:01:26.939 --> 00:01:29.960 
another special thing I love about these
batteries<00:01:27.420> is<00:01:27.600> the<00:01:28.140> charger<00:01:28.770> now<00:01:28.950> this<00:01:29.430> is

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:29.970 
batteries is the charger now this is

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:32.120 
batteries is the charger now this is
quite<00:01:30.240> a<00:01:30.329> sophisticated<00:01:30.680> charger<00:01:31.680> now<00:01:31.890> this

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.830 
other than that each of these bass have
a<00:02:00.960> individual<00:02:01.950> circuit<00:02:02.880> that<00:02:03.090> means<00:02:03.149> all<00:02:03.630> the

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
a individual circuit that means all the

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:05.840 
a individual circuit that means all the
batteries<00:02:04.079> are<00:02:04.320> charging<00:02:04.710> independent<00:02:05.700> of

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:05.850 
batteries are charging independent of

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:09.529 
batteries are charging independent of
each<00:02:06.299> other<00:02:06.360> now<00:02:06.990> in<00:02:07.259> the<00:02:07.950> lower<00:02:08.580> end<00:02:08.879> charges

00:02:09.529 --> 00:02:09.539 
each other now in the lower end charges

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.940 
each other now in the lower end charges
in<00:02:10.020> the<00:02:10.349> inferior<00:02:10.860> charges<00:02:12.470> the

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:13.950 
in the inferior charges the

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:16.940 
in the inferior charges the
all<00:02:14.250> the<00:02:14.910> batteries<00:02:15.300> are<00:02:15.510> in<00:02:15.840> one<00:02:16.290> circuit

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950 
all the batteries are in one circuit

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.979 
all the batteries are in one circuit
that<00:02:17.250> means<00:02:17.310> all<00:02:17.940> the<00:02:18.330> batteries<00:02:18.569> will<00:02:18.780> charge

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
that means all the batteries will charge

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:21.110 
that means all the batteries will charge
at<00:02:19.140> the<00:02:19.230> same<00:02:19.410> time<00:02:19.709> but<00:02:20.250> when<00:02:20.459> one<00:02:20.790> of<00:02:20.819> them

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
at the same time but when one of them

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.930 
at the same time but when one of them
fills<00:02:21.390> up<00:02:21.599> it<00:02:22.349> stops<00:02:22.680> charging<00:02:22.920> and<00:02:23.310> it<00:02:23.700> takes

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:23.940 
fills up it stops charging and it takes

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.660 
fills up it stops charging and it takes
all<00:02:24.180> four<00:02:24.629> batteries<00:02:24.930> as<00:02:25.170> a<00:02:25.560> fool<00:02:25.920> now<00:02:26.489> for

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:26.670 
all four batteries as a fool now for

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:29.240 
all four batteries as a fool now for
this<00:02:26.879> it<00:02:27.060> has<00:02:27.239> eight<00:02:27.480> days<00:02:27.780> and<00:02:28.019> each<00:02:28.590> battery

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
this it has eight days and each battery

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:30.680 
this it has eight days and each battery
will<00:02:29.400> be<00:02:29.519> charged<00:02:29.730> individually<00:02:30.360> that<00:02:30.510> means

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
will be charged individually that means

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.900 
will be charged individually that means
I<00:02:30.750> can<00:02:30.900> put<00:02:31.080> eight<00:02:31.340> batteries<00:02:32.340> of<00:02:32.519> all

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 
I can put eight batteries of all

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:35.479 
I can put eight batteries of all
different<00:02:33.450> charges<00:02:33.930> into<00:02:34.349> this<00:02:34.530> and<00:02:34.800> it<00:02:35.340> will

00:02:35.479 --> 00:02:35.489 
different charges into this and it will

00:02:35.489 --> 00:02:37.940 
different charges into this and it will
fully<00:02:35.730> charge<00:02:36.090> each<00:02:36.660> one<00:02:36.900> and<00:02:37.080> stop<00:02:37.440> each<00:02:37.650> one

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:37.950 
fully charge each one and stop each one

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:40.880 
fully charge each one and stop each one
individually<00:02:38.810> all<00:02:39.810> right<00:02:39.930> so<00:02:40.080> I<00:02:40.110> am<00:02:40.410> now<00:02:40.709> going

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
individually all right so I am now going

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:42.830 
individually all right so I am now going
to<00:02:40.950> demonstrate<00:02:41.099> by<00:02:41.760> inserting<00:02:42.239> batteries<00:02:42.660> in

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:42.840 
to demonstrate by inserting batteries in

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.240 
to demonstrate by inserting batteries in
now<00:02:43.049> actually<00:02:43.500> you're<00:02:43.590> supposed<00:02:43.860> to<00:02:43.920> turn<00:02:44.069> off

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:44.250 
now actually you're supposed to turn off

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:46.580 
now actually you're supposed to turn off
the<00:02:44.370> power<00:02:44.519> before<00:02:44.750> putting<00:02:45.750> these<00:02:45.930> in<00:02:46.200> but

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:46.590 
the power before putting these in but

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:49.460 
the power before putting these in but
I'm<00:02:47.010> just<00:02:47.280> gonna<00:02:47.430> put<00:02:47.700> them<00:02:47.819> in<00:02:47.970> anyways<00:02:48.440> so<00:02:49.440> I

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:49.470 
I'm just gonna put them in anyways so I

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.710 
I'm just gonna put them in anyways so I
put<00:02:49.709> one<00:02:49.739> in<00:02:50.130> as<00:02:50.340> you<00:02:50.400> can<00:02:50.489> see<00:02:50.849> it<00:02:51.209> has<00:02:51.450> a<00:02:51.540> nice

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:51.720 
put one in as you can see it has a nice

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:56.030 
put one in as you can see it has a nice
LCD<00:02:52.069> indicate<00:02:53.069> indicator<00:02:54.030> that<00:02:54.690> shows<00:02:55.040> what's

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:56.040 
LCD indicate indicator that shows what's

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:00.110 
LCD indicate indicator that shows what's
going<00:02:56.340> on<00:02:58.069> all<00:02:59.069> right<00:02:59.160> so<00:02:59.400> you<00:02:59.459> can<00:02:59.640> see<00:02:59.910> is

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.120 
going on all right so you can see is

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.140 
going on all right so you can see is
charging<00:03:00.930> as<00:03:01.799> the<00:03:02.099> indicators<00:03:02.640> are<00:03:02.760> showing

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.150 
charging as the indicators are showing

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:06.319 
charging as the indicators are showing
now<00:03:03.720> the<00:03:03.780> indicator<00:03:04.410> shows<00:03:05.190> will<00:03:05.819> even<00:03:06.090> show

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:06.329 
now the indicator shows will even show

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:08.059 
now the indicator shows will even show
the<00:03:06.540> battery<00:03:06.750> level<00:03:06.900> in<00:03:07.230> three<00:03:07.380> stages<00:03:07.709> so<00:03:08.010> you

00:03:08.059 --> 00:03:08.069 
the battery level in three stages so you

00:03:08.069 --> 00:03:09.860 
the battery level in three stages so you
can<00:03:08.250> see<00:03:08.519> it's<00:03:08.700> basically<00:03:08.910> a<00:03:09.120> low<00:03:09.269> medium<00:03:09.480> high

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:09.870 
can see it's basically a low medium high

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.809 
can see it's basically a low medium high
and<00:03:10.200> it<00:03:10.650> will<00:03:10.739> show<00:03:11.010> you<00:03:11.069> the<00:03:11.310> remaining

00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:11.819 
and it will show you the remaining

00:03:11.819 --> 00:03:14.720 
and it will show you the remaining
capacity<00:03:11.970> left<00:03:12.900> in<00:03:13.230> the<00:03:13.500> batteries<00:03:13.860> and<00:03:14.310> also

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:14.730 
capacity left in the batteries and also

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:17.180 
capacity left in the batteries and also
show<00:03:15.090> you<00:03:15.120> the<00:03:15.390> charging<00:03:15.810> progress<00:03:16.349> so<00:03:16.980> it's<00:03:17.130> a

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
show you the charging progress so it's a

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:18.920 
show you the charging progress so it's a
very<00:03:17.370> nice<00:03:17.519> thing<00:03:17.760> to<00:03:17.819> have<00:03:18.030> you'd<00:03:18.299> know<00:03:18.480> how

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
very nice thing to have you'd know how

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:20.870 
very nice thing to have you'd know how
your<00:03:19.079> batteries<00:03:19.380> are<00:03:19.470> charging<00:03:19.829> and<00:03:20.190> you<00:03:20.670> get

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:20.880 
your batteries are charging and you get

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.479 
your batteries are charging and you get
an<00:03:21.299> eye<00:03:21.840> an<00:03:22.079> idea<00:03:22.440> of<00:03:22.590> how<00:03:22.799> long<00:03:23.010> left<00:03:23.250> before

00:03:23.479 --> 00:03:23.489 
an eye an idea of how long left before

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:26.270 
an eye an idea of how long left before
they<00:03:24.180> are<00:03:24.389> fully<00:03:24.690> charged<00:03:25.260> so<00:03:25.590> that<00:03:25.829> is<00:03:26.069> very

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:26.280 
they are fully charged so that is very

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.910 
they are fully charged so that is very
neat<00:03:26.700> now<00:03:27.420> another<00:03:28.019> neat<00:03:28.200> thing<00:03:28.230> about<00:03:28.500> the

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:28.920 
neat now another neat thing about the

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:31.400 
neat now another neat thing about the
charger<00:03:29.370> is<00:03:29.549> that<00:03:30.269> this<00:03:30.480> charger<00:03:30.870> is<00:03:31.019> actually

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410 
charger is that this charger is actually

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:34.129 
charger is that this charger is actually
compatible<00:03:32.069> with<00:03:32.400> any<00:03:32.880> loop<00:03:33.269> batteries<00:03:33.780> so<00:03:33.989> if

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:34.139 
compatible with any loop batteries so if

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:36.740 
compatible with any loop batteries so if
you<00:03:34.260> have<00:03:34.440> any<00:03:35.040> loop<00:03:35.660> recharge<00:03:36.660> your

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:36.750 
you have any loop recharge your

fine<00:03:41.329> now<00:03:42.329> if<00:03:42.450> you<00:03:42.540> look<00:03:42.690> on<00:03:42.810> the<00:03:42.959> side<00:03:43.170> of<00:03:43.200> the

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:43.350 
fine now if you look on the side of the

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:46.160 
fine now if you look on the side of the
charge<00:03:43.560> you<00:03:43.650> can<00:03:43.799> see<00:03:44.069> two<00:03:44.370> buttons<00:03:44.940> now<00:03:45.600> this

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
charge you can see two buttons now this

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:48.080 
charge you can see two buttons now this
is<00:03:46.440> the<00:03:46.739> conditioning<00:03:47.340> button<00:03:47.639> and<00:03:47.850> this<00:03:48.030> is

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090 
is the conditioning button and this is

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:50.180 
is the conditioning button and this is
the<00:03:48.180> soft<00:03:48.450> charge<00:03:48.989> button<00:03:49.410> so<00:03:49.799> like<00:03:50.010> I<00:03:50.130> said

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
the soft charge button so like I said

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.129 
the soft charge button so like I said
just<00:03:50.370> now<00:03:50.579> there<00:03:51.180> are<00:03:51.269> two<00:03:51.510> modes<00:03:51.720> on<00:03:51.959> this

00:03:52.129 --> 00:03:52.139 
just now there are two modes on this

00:03:52.139 --> 00:03:55.370 
just now there are two modes on this
charger<00:03:52.590> a<00:03:52.739> soft<00:03:53.730> charge<00:03:54.030> and<00:03:54.420> quick<00:03:55.139> charge

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:57.970 
charger a soft charge and quick charge
now<00:03:55.650> even<00:03:55.889> in<00:03:56.010> quick<00:03:56.310> charge<00:03:56.609> it<00:03:57.030> basically

00:03:57.970 --> 00:03:57.980 
now even in quick charge it basically

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:01.089 
now even in quick charge it basically
charges<00:03:58.980> the<00:03:59.130> batteries<00:03:59.519> at<00:03:59.730> a<00:04:00.180> higher

00:04:01.089 --> 00:04:01.099 
charges the batteries at a higher

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:04.699 
charges the batteries at a higher
current<00:04:02.180> hence<00:04:03.180> reducing<00:04:03.900> the<00:04:04.170> time<00:04:04.349> required

00:04:04.699 --> 00:04:04.709 
current hence reducing the time required

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:07.099 
current hence reducing the time required
for<00:04:04.769> the<00:04:04.950> berries<00:04:05.250> to<00:04:05.370> fully<00:04:05.609> charge<00:04:05.810> now<00:04:06.810> if

00:04:07.099 --> 00:04:07.109 
for the berries to fully charge now if

00:04:07.109 --> 00:04:09.229 
for the berries to fully charge now if
you're<00:04:07.290> using<00:04:07.319> soft<00:04:07.769> charge<00:04:08.069> recharge<00:04:09.000> the

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:09.239 
you're using soft charge recharge the

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:11.930 
you're using soft charge recharge the
batteries<00:04:09.599> with<00:04:09.930> a<00:04:09.959> lower<00:04:10.380> currents<00:04:11.040> but<00:04:11.639> then

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
batteries with a lower currents but then

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:13.699 
batteries with a lower currents but then
the<00:04:12.419> charging<00:04:12.840> time<00:04:12.870> will<00:04:13.260> be<00:04:13.349> increased

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:13.709 
the charging time will be increased

00:04:13.709 --> 00:04:16.339 
the charging time will be increased
because<00:04:13.919> the<00:04:14.130> current<00:04:14.430> is<00:04:14.489> lower<00:04:14.880> so<00:04:15.480> this<00:04:16.139> is

00:04:16.339 --> 00:04:16.349 
because the current is lower so this is

00:04:16.349 --> 00:04:18.560 
because the current is lower so this is
actually<00:04:17.039> better<00:04:17.340> for<00:04:17.700> the<00:04:17.789> batteries<00:04:18.180> it

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
actually better for the batteries it

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.240 
actually better for the batteries it
will<00:04:18.780> actually<00:04:18.930> increase<00:04:19.470> the<00:04:19.919> battery's

00:04:20.240 --> 00:04:20.250 
will actually increase the battery's

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:22.850 
will actually increase the battery's
life<00:04:20.430> span<00:04:20.760> and<00:04:21.030> it's<00:04:21.269> not<00:04:21.539> that<00:04:21.780> damaging<00:04:22.440> to

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
life span and it's not that damaging to

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:25.159 
life span and it's not that damaging to
the<00:04:22.950> batteries<00:04:23.340> as<00:04:24.030> opposed<00:04:24.479> to<00:04:24.720> the<00:04:24.900> quick

00:04:25.159 --> 00:04:25.169 
the batteries as opposed to the quick

00:04:25.169 --> 00:04:27.560 
the batteries as opposed to the quick
charge<00:04:25.470> now<00:04:25.830> do<00:04:26.550> note<00:04:26.760> that<00:04:26.789> the<00:04:27.240> soft

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:27.570 
charge now do note that the soft

00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:30.140 
charge now do note that the soft
charge<00:04:27.780> will<00:04:28.080> take<00:04:28.320> up<00:04:28.500> a<00:04:28.650> lot<00:04:28.980> more<00:04:29.310> time<00:04:29.370> so

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.150 
charge will take up a lot more time so

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:32.420 
charge will take up a lot more time so
it<00:04:30.270> could<00:04:30.480> be<00:04:30.630> double<00:04:31.110> or<00:04:31.320> more<00:04:31.620> the<00:04:32.130> amount<00:04:32.400> of

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:32.430 
it could be double or more the amount of

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:35.270 
it could be double or more the amount of
time<00:04:32.700> needed<00:04:32.880> for<00:04:33.180> it<00:04:33.480> typical<00:04:33.950> fast<00:04:34.950> charge

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.280 
time needed for it typical fast charge

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:38.690 
time needed for it typical fast charge
compared<00:04:36.210> to<00:04:36.660> a<00:04:36.690> soft<00:04:37.230> charge<00:04:37.560> and<00:04:37.920> this

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:38.700 
compared to a soft charge and this

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:40.700 
compared to a soft charge and this
button<00:04:38.940> here<00:04:39.210> as<00:04:39.420> you<00:04:39.630> can<00:04:39.750> see<00:04:39.930> is<00:04:40.110> the

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:40.710 
button here as you can see is the

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:42.260 
button here as you can see is the
conditioning<00:04:41.580> button

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.270 
conditioning button

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:44.570 
conditioning button
so<00:04:43.020> what<00:04:43.260> conditioning<00:04:43.860> does<00:04:44.100> is<00:04:44.310> basically

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.580 
so what conditioning does is basically

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:47.630 
so what conditioning does is basically
it<00:04:44.820> will<00:04:45.090> fully<00:04:45.480> discharge<00:04:46.410> the<00:04:47.040> battery<00:04:47.070> and

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:47.640 
it will fully discharge the battery and

00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:50.330 
it will fully discharge the battery and
then<00:04:48.210> it<00:04:48.390> will<00:04:48.630> recharge<00:04:49.200> it<00:04:49.500> back<00:04:49.950> to<00:04:50.100> full

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:50.340 
then it will recharge it back to full

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:53.120 
then it will recharge it back to full
discharge<00:04:51.120> it<00:04:51.570> again<00:04:51.810> and<00:04:52.050> recharge<00:04:52.800> back<00:04:53.010> to

00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:53.130 
discharge it again and recharge back to

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:55.880 
discharge it again and recharge back to
full<00:04:53.340> in<00:04:53.670> quite<00:04:54.420> a<00:04:54.450> few<00:04:54.690> times<00:04:54.930> so<00:04:55.230> by<00:04:55.590> doing

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:55.890 
full in quite a few times so by doing

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:57.530 
full in quite a few times so by doing
this<00:04:56.070> it<00:04:56.310> will<00:04:56.370> actually<00:04:56.730> condition<00:04:57.420> the

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:57.540 
this it will actually condition the

00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:00.710 
this it will actually condition the
battery<00:04:57.900> and<00:04:58.050> we<00:04:58.490> remove<00:04:59.490> all<00:04:59.790> memory<00:05:00.390> effects

00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:00.720 
battery and we remove all memory effects

00:05:00.720 --> 00:05:02.450 
battery and we remove all memory effects
although<00:05:00.960> I'm<00:05:01.170> pretty<00:05:01.560> sure<00:05:01.740> that<00:05:01.920> with

00:05:02.450 --> 00:05:02.460 
although I'm pretty sure that with

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:04.700 
although I'm pretty sure that with
nickel<00:05:03.270> metal<00:05:03.360> hydride<00:05:03.540> batteries<00:05:04.200> the

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:04.710 
nickel metal hydride batteries the

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:07.010 
nickel metal hydride batteries the
memory<00:05:05.040> effect<00:05:05.190> is<00:05:05.610> pretty<00:05:06.270> much<00:05:06.420> eliminated

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:07.020 
memory effect is pretty much eliminated

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:09.620 
memory effect is pretty much eliminated
but<00:05:07.740> still<00:05:07.950> it's<00:05:08.150> recommended<00:05:09.150> in<00:05:09.240> the<00:05:09.330> manual

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:09.630 
but still it's recommended in the manual

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:11.120 
but still it's recommended in the manual
to<00:05:09.660> condition<00:05:10.170> your<00:05:10.260> batteries<00:05:10.590> once<00:05:10.890> in<00:05:11.070> a

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:11.130 
to condition your batteries once in a

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:13.330 
to condition your batteries once in a
while<00:05:11.310> so<00:05:11.730> you<00:05:11.820> get<00:05:11.970> the<00:05:12.120> maximum<00:05:12.420> amount<00:05:13.020> of

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:13.340 
while so you get the maximum amount of

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:15.170 
while so you get the maximum amount of
charge<00:05:14.340> and<00:05:14.490> the<00:05:14.610> maximum<00:05:14.880> amount<00:05:15.090> of

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:15.180 
charge and the maximum amount of

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:17.510 
charge and the maximum amount of
capacity<00:05:15.750> you<00:05:16.350> can<00:05:16.380> enjoy<00:05:16.800> with<00:05:17.250> these

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:17.520 
capacity you can enjoy with these

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:19.970 
capacity you can enjoy with these
Powerex<00:05:18.240> batteries<00:05:18.870> so<00:05:19.410> other<00:05:19.740> than<00:05:19.890> that

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:19.980 
Powerex batteries so other than that

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:21.980 
Powerex batteries so other than that
these<00:05:20.190> are<00:05:20.520> very<00:05:21.390> good<00:05:21.570> batteries<00:05:21.870> they

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:21.990 
these are very good batteries they

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:24.110 
these are very good batteries they
function<00:05:22.380> very<00:05:22.410> well<00:05:22.740> they<00:05:23.460> last<00:05:23.730> pretty<00:05:23.970> long

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:24.120 
function very well they last pretty long

00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:28.880 
function very well they last pretty long
because<00:05:24.690> of<00:05:24.840> their<00:05:25.380> very<00:05:25.740> high<00:05:27.140> capacity<00:05:28.140> 2.7

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:28.890 
because of their very high capacity 2.7

but what I wasn't too satisfied about

00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:50.990 
but what I wasn't too satisfied about
was<00:05:49.350> the<00:05:49.590> charger<00:05:50.010> the<00:05:50.130> an<00:05:50.250> adduct<00:05:50.580> charger
