00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:59.690
Nintendo

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:16.040
This game will transport you into a wonderfull
world of genies, flying carpets, princesses

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.190
and snake like villains.

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:29.730
In Aladdin, the game follows the story of
the actual movie Disney's Aladdin as he's

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:37.600
journeys from being a lowly street rat living
in the poorest section of Agrabah, to becoming

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.140
Princess Jasmine's husband.

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:46.140
In Aladdin for Super Nintendo (SNES) you will
be able to control the main character Aladdin,

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.550
as he travels through different parts of Agrabah
and beyond collecting apples and gemstones

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:51.120
to gain more lives so that he can complete
his mission of saving the princess from the

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:59.450
evil Jafar, and defeating him in the final
battle!
