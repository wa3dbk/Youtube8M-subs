welcome to 9450 shooting mechanics where

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.079 
welcome to 9450 shooting mechanics where
today<00:00:04.920> we're<00:00:05.100> going<00:00:05.190> to<00:00:05.279> talk<00:00:05.520> about<00:00:05.790> how<00:00:06.029> to

00:00:06.079 --> 00:00:06.089 
today we're going to talk about how to

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:09.400 
today we're going to talk about how to
increase<00:00:06.690> range<00:00:07.049> accuracy<00:00:07.890> and<00:00:08.340> shot<00:00:08.849> speed

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:09.410 
increase range accuracy and shot speed

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:11.959 
increase range accuracy and shot speed
one<00:00:10.410> of<00:00:10.530> the<00:00:10.620> things<00:00:10.889> that<00:00:11.250> all<00:00:11.460> great

00:00:11.959 --> 00:00:11.969 
one of the things that all great

00:00:11.969 --> 00:00:14.270 
one of the things that all great
shooters<00:00:12.420> know<00:00:12.630> how<00:00:12.809> to<00:00:12.870> do<00:00:13.139> is<00:00:13.410> to<00:00:14.070> generate

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:14.280 
shooters know how to do is to generate

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.570 
shooters know how to do is to generate
power<00:00:14.910> and<00:00:15.240> harvest<00:00:16.199> that<00:00:16.410> power<00:00:16.710> when<00:00:17.430> they

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:17.580 
power and harvest that power when they

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.120 
power and harvest that power when they
shoot<00:00:17.880> so<00:00:18.480> that<00:00:18.510> the<00:00:19.140> release<00:00:19.500> of<00:00:19.680> that<00:00:19.859> power

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
shoot so that the release of that power

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.029 
shoot so that the release of that power
is<00:00:20.430> very<00:00:20.670> consistent<00:00:21.150> and<00:00:21.619> great<00:00:22.619> shooters

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
is very consistent and great shooters

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.279 
is very consistent and great shooters
know<00:00:23.730> how<00:00:23.850> to<00:00:23.910> do<00:00:24.119> this<00:00:24.269> regardless<00:00:25.019> of<00:00:25.199> the

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289 
know how to do this regardless of the

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:26.900 
know how to do this regardless of the
type<00:00:25.470> of<00:00:25.500> shot<00:00:25.830> they're<00:00:26.039> taking<00:00:26.490> whether<00:00:26.670> it's

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:26.910 
type of shot they're taking whether it's

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.700 
type of shot they're taking whether it's
off<00:00:27.060> the<00:00:27.210> screen<00:00:27.539> or<00:00:27.779> off<00:00:27.900> the<00:00:28.140> dribble<00:00:28.349> or

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:28.710 
off the screen or off the dribble or

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.310 
off the screen or off the dribble or
just<00:00:28.890> stand<00:00:29.160> still<00:00:29.429> and<00:00:29.670> they<00:00:30.630> will<00:00:30.750> do<00:00:30.869> it<00:00:30.990> the

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
just stand still and they will do it the

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:34.069 
just stand still and they will do it the
same<00:00:31.619> way<00:00:31.650> every<00:00:32.040> time<00:00:32.690> regardless<00:00:33.690> of<00:00:33.930> their

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
same way every time regardless of their

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:34.600 
same way every time regardless of their
distance

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:34.610 
distance

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:37.220 
distance
so<00:00:35.610> as<00:00:35.820> we<00:00:35.969> break<00:00:36.210> down<00:00:36.270> the<00:00:36.630> secrets<00:00:37.020> today

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
so as we break down the secrets today

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:40.790 
so as we break down the secrets today
for<00:00:38.129> great<00:00:38.850> shooting<00:00:39.329> what<00:00:40.170> we'll<00:00:40.320> notice<00:00:40.649> is

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
for great shooting what we'll notice is

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.250 
for great shooting what we'll notice is
that<00:00:40.860> these<00:00:41.250> shooters<00:00:42.239> know<00:00:42.480> how<00:00:42.660> to<00:00:42.719> do<00:00:42.930> three

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:43.260 
that these shooters know how to do three

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.130 
that these shooters know how to do three
things<00:00:43.469> and<00:00:43.829> how<00:00:43.980> to<00:00:44.010> generate<00:00:44.460> the<00:00:44.640> power

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:45.140 
things and how to generate the power

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:47.389 
things and how to generate the power
harvest<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.289> power<00:00:46.530> very<00:00:46.860> well<00:00:47.129> through

00:00:47.389 --> 00:00:47.399 
harvest the power very well through

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:50.209 
harvest the power very well through
their<00:00:47.550> body<00:00:47.730> in<00:00:48.079> releasing<00:00:49.079> that<00:00:49.350> power<00:00:49.649> with

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
their body in releasing that power with

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.520 
their body in releasing that power with
their<00:00:50.399> wrists<00:00:50.640> so<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.600> first<00:00:51.899> thing<00:00:52.110> we<00:00:52.260> start

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
their wrists so the first thing we start

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:54.380 
their wrists so the first thing we start
to<00:00:52.649> break<00:00:52.829> down<00:00:53.129> with<00:00:53.309> any<00:00:53.520> shooter<00:00:53.940> is<00:00:54.090> can

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390 
to break down with any shooter is can

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.360 
to break down with any shooter is can
they<00:00:54.570> generate<00:00:54.989> power<00:00:55.230> from<00:00:55.680> their<00:00:55.860> legs<00:00:56.070> and

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:56.370 
they generate power from their legs and

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:59.810 
they generate power from their legs and
even<00:00:56.940> power<00:00:57.420> with<00:00:57.780> both<00:00:58.020> legs<00:00:58.579> first<00:00:59.579> thing

00:00:59.810 --> 00:00:59.820 
even power with both legs first thing

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.459 
even power with both legs first thing
we'll<00:00:59.940> notice<00:01:00.090> is<00:01:00.390> that<00:01:00.449> Tim<00:01:00.840> is<00:01:01.020> creating

00:01:01.459 --> 00:01:01.469 
we'll notice is that Tim is creating

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.560 
we'll notice is that Tim is creating
energy<00:01:01.620> even<00:01:02.190> before<00:01:02.340> he<00:01:02.820> catches<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.390> ball

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
energy even before he catches the ball

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.810 
energy even before he catches the ball
he<00:01:03.809> starts<00:01:04.530> to<00:01:04.680> step<00:01:04.890> in<00:01:05.070> before<00:01:05.280> the<00:01:05.640> ball

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:05.820 
he starts to step in before the ball

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:08.000 
he starts to step in before the ball
arrives<00:01:06.180> so<00:01:06.840> that<00:01:06.960> he<00:01:07.049> can<00:01:07.200> create<00:01:07.439> that<00:01:07.680> power

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:08.010 
arrives so that he can create that power

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.219 
arrives so that he can create that power
that<00:01:08.310> energy<00:01:08.760> that<00:01:08.939> upward<00:01:09.360> momentum<00:01:09.540> into

00:01:10.219 --> 00:01:10.229 
that energy that upward momentum into

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:13.370 
that energy that upward momentum into
his<00:01:10.350> shot<00:01:10.619> for<00:01:11.400> a<00:01:11.430> fast<00:01:11.729> release<00:01:12.150> the<00:01:13.140> next

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:13.380 
his shot for a fast release the next

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.780 
his shot for a fast release the next
thing<00:01:13.590> he'll<00:01:13.710> do<00:01:13.830> is<00:01:13.860> he'll<00:01:14.040> take<00:01:14.100> that<00:01:14.310> pass

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:14.790 
thing he'll do is he'll take that pass

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.609 
thing he'll do is he'll take that pass
and<00:01:15.090> he'll<00:01:15.450> put<00:01:15.659> it<00:01:15.689> right<00:01:15.990> into<00:01:16.170> the<00:01:16.320> shooters

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
and he'll put it right into the shooters

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.830 
and he'll put it right into the shooters
pocket<00:01:17.040> over<00:01:17.250> a<00:01:17.310> shooting<00:01:17.729> knee<00:01:17.909> so<00:01:18.540> that<00:01:18.570> as

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:18.840 
pocket over a shooting knee so that as

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:21.380 
pocket over a shooting knee so that as
he<00:01:18.960> creates<00:01:19.409> that<00:01:19.619> jump<00:01:20.040> that<00:01:20.250> upward<00:01:20.640> left<00:01:20.970> he

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
he creates that jump that upward left he

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:23.929 
he creates that jump that upward left he
can<00:01:21.630> rotate<00:01:21.869> it<00:01:22.229> right<00:01:23.100> to<00:01:23.280> the<00:01:23.369> shooting<00:01:23.700> spot

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:23.939 
can rotate it right to the shooting spot

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:26.060 
can rotate it right to the shooting spot
over<00:01:24.119> his<00:01:24.270> forehead<00:01:24.590> you<00:01:25.590> notice<00:01:25.890> he's

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:26.070 
over his forehead you notice he's

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:28.249 
over his forehead you notice he's
jumping<00:01:26.490> evenly<00:01:26.939> with<00:01:27.090> both<00:01:27.390> legs<00:01:27.659> not<00:01:27.990> just

00:01:28.249 --> 00:01:28.259 
jumping evenly with both legs not just

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:30.740 
jumping evenly with both legs not just
his<00:01:28.409> dominant<00:01:28.860> leg<00:01:29.070> so<00:01:29.759> that<00:01:29.970> allows<00:01:30.420> him<00:01:30.720> to

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:30.750 
his dominant leg so that allows him to

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.469 
his dominant leg so that allows him to
keep<00:01:31.049> his<00:01:31.470> hips<00:01:31.860> and<00:01:32.070> his<00:01:32.640> shoulders<00:01:33.090> Square

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:33.479 
keep his hips and his shoulders Square

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:35.810 
keep his hips and his shoulders Square
to<00:01:33.509> the<00:01:33.659> basket<00:01:34.110> as<00:01:34.259> he<00:01:34.770> rotates<00:01:35.250> the<00:01:35.460> ball<00:01:35.640> to

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820 
to the basket as he rotates the ball to

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.550 
to the basket as he rotates the ball to
the<00:01:35.939> eyebrow<00:01:36.329> and<00:01:36.570> not<00:01:36.900> the<00:01:37.110> center<00:01:37.380> of<00:01:37.470> the

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:37.560 
the eyebrow and not the center of the

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.740 
the eyebrow and not the center of the
forehead<00:01:37.829> and<00:01:38.220> there<00:01:38.820> again<00:01:39.119> is<00:01:39.270> a<00:01:39.299> look<00:01:39.570> at

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:39.750 
forehead and there again is a look at

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.380 
forehead and there again is a look at
how<00:01:40.320> square<00:01:40.829> is<00:01:41.009> hips<00:01:41.280> and<00:01:41.700> his<00:01:41.759> shoulders<00:01:42.180> are

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
how square is hips and his shoulders are

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.420 
how square is hips and his shoulders are
right<00:01:42.780> at<00:01:42.930> the<00:01:42.960> target<00:01:43.259> and<00:01:43.530> that<00:01:44.070> will<00:01:44.220> create

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
right at the target and that will create

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.760 
right at the target and that will create
a<00:01:44.610> very<00:01:44.970> accurate<00:01:45.240> shot<00:01:45.780> but<00:01:46.110> it's<00:01:46.229> important

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
a very accurate shot but it's important

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.499 
a very accurate shot but it's important
that<00:01:46.799> you<00:01:46.950> jump<00:01:47.340> with<00:01:47.520> both<00:01:47.790> legs<00:01:48.119> as<00:01:48.390> you

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:48.509 
that you jump with both legs as you

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:51.319 
that you jump with both legs as you
create<00:01:48.720> that<00:01:48.930> power<00:01:49.729> finally<00:01:50.729> he<00:01:50.909> points<00:01:51.299> to

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
create that power finally he points to

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:54.499 
create that power finally he points to
the<00:01:51.540> basket<00:01:52.020> after<00:01:52.530> his<00:01:52.950> release<00:01:53.159> no<00:01:54.119> use<00:01:54.360> of

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
the basket after his release no use of

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.749 
the basket after his release no use of
the<00:01:54.600> offhand<00:01:55.049> thumb<00:01:55.380> and<00:01:55.649> he's<00:01:56.130> releasing<00:01:56.520> the

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
the offhand thumb and he's releasing the

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.510 
the offhand thumb and he's releasing the
ball<00:01:56.909> with<00:01:57.149> his<00:01:57.180> wrist<00:01:57.659> not<00:01:58.350> his<00:01:58.619> shoulder<00:01:59.009> the

00:01:59.510 --> 00:01:59.520 
ball with his wrist not his shoulder the

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.670 
ball with his wrist not his shoulder the
wrist<00:01:59.820> is<00:02:00.000> a<00:02:00.030> more<00:02:00.299> controllable<00:02:00.899> muscle<00:02:01.380> it's

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:01.680 
wrist is a more controllable muscle it's

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.350 
wrist is a more controllable muscle it's
going<00:02:01.860> to<00:02:01.920> create<00:02:02.189> touch<00:02:02.490> where<00:02:03.210> as<00:02:03.329> a

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
going to create touch where as a

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.600 
going to create touch where as a
shoulder<00:02:03.659> shooter<00:02:04.170> has<00:02:04.710> a<00:02:04.740> tendency<00:02:05.310> to<00:02:05.430> shoot

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:05.610 
shoulder shooter has a tendency to shoot

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.419 
shoulder shooter has a tendency to shoot
it<00:02:05.729> flat<00:02:06.060> and<00:02:06.509> with<00:02:06.780> no<00:02:06.960> backspin<00:02:07.469> so<00:02:08.099> in<00:02:08.220> real

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429 
it flat and with no backspin so in real

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.190 
it flat and with no backspin so in real
time<00:02:08.729> you<00:02:08.940> can<00:02:08.970> see<00:02:09.300> just<00:02:09.479> how<00:02:09.599> quickly<00:02:09.929> he<00:02:10.170> can

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:10.200 
time you can see just how quickly he can

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.680 
time you can see just how quickly he can
get<00:02:10.440> that<00:02:10.590> shot<00:02:10.920> off<00:02:11.129> and<00:02:11.910> how<00:02:12.030> consistently

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690 
get that shot off and how consistently

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:13.880 
get that shot off and how consistently
he'll<00:02:12.930> shoot<00:02:13.110> it<00:02:13.260> everything

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
he'll shoot it everything

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.130 
he'll shoot it everything
time<00:02:14.190> he<00:02:14.760> touches<00:02:15.000> the<00:02:15.180> ball<00:02:15.300> and<00:02:15.720> that's<00:02:15.900> the

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:16.140 
time he touches the ball and that's the

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.400 
time he touches the ball and that's the
secret<00:02:16.530> to<00:02:16.710> great<00:02:16.830> shooting<00:02:18.140> so<00:02:19.140> another

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:19.410 
secret to great shooting so another

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.830 
secret to great shooting so another
question<00:02:19.680> we<00:02:20.010> get<00:02:20.190> on<00:02:20.400> Power<00:02:20.880> Generation<00:02:21.240> is

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:21.840 
question we get on Power Generation is

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.990 
question we get on Power Generation is
should<00:02:22.200> a<00:02:22.230> player<00:02:22.440> jump<00:02:22.950> straight<00:02:23.640> up<00:02:23.819> and

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
should a player jump straight up and

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.090 
should a player jump straight up and
straight<00:02:24.209> down<00:02:24.240> or<00:02:24.480> towards<00:02:25.020> the<00:02:25.080> rim<00:02:25.380> and

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.100 
straight down or towards the rim and

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.130 
straight down or towards the rim and
you'll<00:02:26.280> notice<00:02:26.580> what<00:02:26.790> Tim<00:02:27.390> is<00:02:27.540> doing<00:02:27.569> is<00:02:27.959> he's

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140 
you'll notice what Tim is doing is he's

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.260 
you'll notice what Tim is doing is he's
actually<00:02:28.530> jumping<00:02:28.860> up<00:02:29.100> first<00:02:29.459> but<00:02:30.090> then

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:30.270 
actually jumping up first but then

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.480 
actually jumping up first but then
slightly<00:02:30.660> forward<00:02:31.230> and<00:02:31.380> when<00:02:31.890> that<00:02:32.010> gives<00:02:32.340> a

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:32.490 
slightly forward and when that gives a

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:35.480 
slightly forward and when that gives a
shooter<00:02:32.820> is<00:02:33.300> more<00:02:33.630> power<00:02:33.900> and<00:02:34.170> that<00:02:34.800> power<00:02:34.860> can

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:35.490 
shooter is more power and that power can

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:37.699 
shooter is more power and that power can
create<00:02:35.850> the<00:02:36.030> arc<00:02:36.240> that<00:02:36.750> you<00:02:36.900> want<00:02:37.140> for<00:02:37.350> a<00:02:37.410> soft

00:02:37.699 --> 00:02:37.709 
create the arc that you want for a soft

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:40.820 
create the arc that you want for a soft
shot<00:02:38.570> and<00:02:39.570> this<00:02:39.660> is<00:02:39.810> a<00:02:39.840> common<00:02:40.230> trait<00:02:40.470> we<00:02:40.620> see

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:40.830 
shot and this is a common trait we see

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.440 
shot and this is a common trait we see
with<00:02:41.040> nearly<00:02:41.280> all<00:02:41.370> the<00:02:41.670> great<00:02:41.850> shooters<00:02:42.239> that

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
with nearly all the great shooters that

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.449 
with nearly all the great shooters that
we<00:02:42.540> test<00:02:42.870> and<00:02:43.110> that<00:02:43.170> they<00:02:43.350> understand<00:02:44.130> how

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:44.459 
we test and that they understand how

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:47.150 
we test and that they understand how
important<00:02:45.360> it<00:02:45.450> is<00:02:45.540> to<00:02:45.810> leverage<00:02:46.140> to<00:02:46.560> use<00:02:46.590> that

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:47.160 
important it is to leverage to use that

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.660 
important it is to leverage to use that
forward<00:02:47.580> momentum<00:02:47.810> to<00:02:48.810> sustain<00:02:49.440> accuracy<00:02:50.280> in

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:50.670 
forward momentum to sustain accuracy in

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:53.120 
forward momentum to sustain accuracy in
consistency<00:02:51.630> in<00:02:51.870> their<00:02:51.989> shot<00:02:52.260> even<00:02:52.980> with

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.130 
consistency in their shot even with

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:55.160 
consistency in their shot even with
distance<00:02:53.550> so<00:02:53.730> as<00:02:54.239> we<00:02:54.480> move<00:02:54.630> Tim<00:02:54.930> to<00:02:55.140> a

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
distance so as we move Tim to a

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:57.140 
distance so as we move Tim to a
different<00:02:55.530> angle<00:02:55.830> on<00:02:55.890> the<00:02:56.040> court<00:02:56.370> it<00:02:56.820> becomes

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:57.150 
different angle on the court it becomes

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.120 
different angle on the court it becomes
very<00:02:57.269> clear<00:02:57.570> how<00:02:58.350> he's<00:02:58.620> doing<00:02:58.920> this

00:02:59.120 --> 00:02:59.130 
very clear how he's doing this

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:02.390 
very clear how he's doing this
as<00:02:59.670> he<00:02:59.880> sets<00:03:00.180> up<00:03:00.739> before<00:03:01.739> the<00:03:01.890> three-point

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
as he sets up before the three-point

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.000 
as he sets up before the three-point
line<00:03:02.750> and<00:03:03.750> he<00:03:03.900> comes<00:03:04.140> forward<00:03:04.470> you<00:03:04.590> see<00:03:04.860> it's

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:05.010 
line and he comes forward you see it's

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:07.160 
line and he comes forward you see it's
about<00:03:05.190> a<00:03:05.250> six<00:03:05.610> to<00:03:05.670> eight<00:03:05.910> inch<00:03:06.209> forward

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:07.170 
about a six to eight inch forward

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:09.530 
about a six to eight inch forward
momentum<00:03:07.440> on<00:03:07.860> that<00:03:08.100> shot<00:03:08.459> it<00:03:09.150> gives<00:03:09.360> him

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:09.540 
momentum on that shot it gives him

00:03:09.540 --> 00:03:11.540 
momentum on that shot it gives him
tremendous<00:03:10.140> advantage<00:03:10.650> when<00:03:11.070> he<00:03:11.190> moves<00:03:11.400> away

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:11.550 
tremendous advantage when he moves away

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:14.300 
tremendous advantage when he moves away
from<00:03:11.760> the<00:03:12.090> basket<00:03:12.540> to<00:03:13.230> keep<00:03:13.440> that<00:03:13.680> arc<00:03:13.980> that

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:14.310 
from the basket to keep that arc that

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:17.900 
from the basket to keep that arc that
shot<00:03:14.610> speed<00:03:15.000> the<00:03:15.630> backspin<00:03:16.260> and<00:03:16.530> the<00:03:17.430> accuracy

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:17.910

he<00:03:18.239> needs<00:03:18.540> to<00:03:19.320> shoot<00:03:19.530> it<00:03:19.650> the<00:03:19.769> same<00:03:20.010> way<00:03:20.190> every

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:20.220 
he needs to shoot it the same way every

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:24.020 
he needs to shoot it the same way every
time<00:03:20.519> and<00:03:21.260> again<00:03:22.260> great<00:03:22.860> shooters<00:03:23.310> understand

00:03:24.020 --> 00:03:24.030 
time and again great shooters understand

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.860 
time and again great shooters understand
the<00:03:24.870> power<00:03:25.260> of<00:03:25.620> forward<00:03:26.610> momentum<00:03:26.790> when<00:03:27.660> they

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870 
the power of forward momentum when they

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:32.390 
the power of forward momentum when they
shoot<00:03:30.170> finally<00:03:31.170> the<00:03:31.680> whole<00:03:31.860> point<00:03:32.220> in

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
shoot finally the whole point in

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.550 
shoot finally the whole point in
focusing<00:03:33.060> on<00:03:33.180> why<00:03:33.450> we<00:03:33.660> create<00:03:33.989> that<00:03:34.140> energy

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
focusing on why we create that energy

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.050 
focusing on why we create that energy
from<00:03:34.769> the<00:03:34.860> legs<00:03:35.100> and<00:03:35.430> transferring<00:03:35.970> it

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
from the legs and transferring it

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.090 
from the legs and transferring it
through<00:03:36.299> the<00:03:36.420> core<00:03:36.750> is<00:03:36.989> that<00:03:37.709> you<00:03:37.860> want<00:03:38.040> to

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
through the core is that you want to

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:39.740 
through the core is that you want to
have<00:03:38.250> an<00:03:38.400> effortless<00:03:38.880> release<00:03:39.269> so<00:03:39.510> that<00:03:39.570> it

00:03:39.740 --> 00:03:39.750 
have an effortless release so that it
