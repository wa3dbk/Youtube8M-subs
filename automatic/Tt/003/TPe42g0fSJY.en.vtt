think his Israeli policies are some of

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.100 
think his Israeli policies are some of
the<00:01:01.530> most<00:01:02.090> anti-israeli<00:01:03.090> foreign<00:01:03.660> policy

states<00:01:12.780> the<00:01:13.049> most<00:01:13.229> dangerous<00:01:13.619> thing<00:01:13.830> we've

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
states the most dangerous thing we've

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.030 
states the most dangerous thing we've
seen<00:01:14.460> since<00:01:14.700> there's<00:01:15.420> been<00:01:15.540> a<00:01:15.799> Jewish<00:01:16.799> state

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
seen since there's been a Jewish state

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.820 
seen since there's been a Jewish state
and<00:01:17.280> certainly<00:01:18.000> his<00:01:18.360> support<00:01:18.750> among<00:01:18.990> Jewish

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830 
and certainly his support among Jewish

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.469 
and certainly his support among Jewish
voters<00:01:20.130> is<00:01:20.400> continuing<00:01:20.970> to<00:01:21.060> plummet<00:01:21.360> it's

00:01:21.469 --> 00:01:21.479 
voters is continuing to plummet it's

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:24.289 
voters is continuing to plummet it's
still<00:01:22.310> relatively<00:01:23.310> strong<00:01:23.700> compared<00:01:24.119> to

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299 
still relatively strong compared to

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.230 
still relatively strong compared to
maybe<00:01:24.960> some<00:01:25.229> other<00:01:25.380> sectors<00:01:25.830> but<00:01:26.520> there's<00:01:27.030> no

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:27.240 
maybe some other sectors but there's no

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.789 
maybe some other sectors but there's no
evidence<00:01:27.420> of<00:01:27.750> this<00:01:27.869> whatsoever<00:01:28.080> I<00:01:28.470> think<00:01:28.710> this

00:01:28.789 --> 00:01:28.799 
evidence of this whatsoever I think this

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.230 
evidence of this whatsoever I think this
is<00:01:28.950> just<00:01:29.130> the<00:01:29.189> kind<00:01:29.310> of<00:01:29.430> desperation<00:01:29.939> that

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
is just the kind of desperation that

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.700 
is just the kind of desperation that
people<00:01:30.600> are<00:01:30.689> using<00:01:30.869> in<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.140> media<00:01:31.380> to<00:01:31.500> keep

00:03:43.689 --> 00:03:43.699 
and turn around again I probably run

00:03:43.699 --> 00:03:45.819 
and turn around again I probably run
whatever<00:03:43.940> outrageous<00:03:44.840> cover<00:03:45.079> I<00:03:45.199> could<00:03:45.590> just
