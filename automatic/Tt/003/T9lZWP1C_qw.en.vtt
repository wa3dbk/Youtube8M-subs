00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:06.900
 the mother who gave birth to the planet as she says 

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.549
 one that I know is blessed 

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:11.970
 the pim pam pum deck 'tuna sandwich 

00:00:08.549 --> 00:00:14.280
 and everything else I'm not here fishing 

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:19.099
 like an idiot to brush a fish 

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:22.890
 clown was going back I went and I get 

00:00:19.099 --> 00:00:27.470
 apart a few drops a saddle a 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:30.520
 bowl and what this piece of bow comes out 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:34.700
 or to see 

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:36.980
 programmers I want to say I delighted 

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:39.380
 to these an arc with before you have this 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:43.280
 infinity red fire broke bility 

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:45.700
 it's fucking great you're just a bow that's 

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:49.600
 a glass is with a rope 

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:52.960
 but I fucking crappy that I get this out and 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.310
 do not leave me the clown that I told you 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:58.090
 I was going to fish it like a 

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:59.980
 unfortunate is that I do not know anymore and I do not know 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:02.170
 I do not know anymore what to do or where to walk 

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:03.320
 neither where to throw or who to turn to 

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.960
 to 

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.880
 My God will look somewhere to see 

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.100
 if it is that clown fish only 

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:12.530
 appear at certain heights because 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:16.120
 is that I want to do let's say the one that would be 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:16.120
 and the final chapter of the series 

00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:20.650
 and such but fuck 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.040
 uncle 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.270
 arch point 

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.490
 fuck 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.659
 but I do not get the clown fish 

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:33.509
 possible 

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:34.770
 well I make this small paragraph because it is 

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:36.700
 that it seemed incredible to me 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.590
 come out that 

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.570
 in the cane that already spends a cane that 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:43.420
 This is the second one I have, but it is 

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:45.429
 is unloved and nothing is incredible 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:47.510
 that I got that and it has not come out 

00:01:45.429 --> 00:01:51.650
 a miserable lashes 

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:55.670
 finally good and you seers then I guess 

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:58.170
 that was for salmon this fish 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:00.430
 The balloon 

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:04.060
 amazing 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:05.590
 well that u2 seers then I guess the 

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:07.480
 Next time you give me back, it will be 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.399
 when you have managed to catch the fish or 

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:11.680
 same as when this cane is enough for me 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:13.180
 I think impossible or if I see that it is 

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.750
 it turns out that it only appears at certain 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:19.510
 heights because as you can see 

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:20.880
 the space station is 139 frames 

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.680
 Tall 

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:25.260
 I can either make myself an artificial lake 

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:26.880
 from below placing blocks while 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:29.150
 I fall through a water jet thing 

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:33.200
 that I'm sure I'll record because 

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:35.810
 that is, it will be worth seeing 

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.250
 and make me a lake down that by the way 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:39.410
 so squid would also appear 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:41.319
 but good that it came out but also 

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:44.379
 I could make books 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:46.030
 but what is said at the moment so here 

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:48.310
 we are waiting to see if he knows the 

00:02:46.030 --> 00:02:50.590
 fucking clown fish 

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:54.130
 and hear that more bows come out of these 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:56.790
 but before years before 

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.790
 anyway 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:03.500
 how much patience you have to have in the 

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:05.750
 world of fishing 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:08.260
 see you today I did not expect it but to 

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:08.260
 see wait see 

00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:14.070
 see you and you see
