translating it translation can also be a

translating it translation can also be a

you can't do that exactly word for word

you can't do that exactly word for word
you'd<00:00:35.940> end<00:00:36.150> up<00:00:36.239> with<00:00:36.390> something<00:00:36.600> like<00:00:36.900> an<00:00:37.170> in<00:00:37.320> a

other end is something that could be
called<00:00:42.299> for<00:00:42.540> lack<00:00:42.690> of<00:00:42.720> a<00:00:42.930> better<00:00:42.960> term<00:00:43.409> a

called for lack of a better term a

called for lack of a better term a

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 
paraphrase that's so loose it really

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:50.390 
paraphrase that's so loose it really
loses<00:00:47.339> what<00:00:48.089> the<00:00:48.239> author<00:00:48.420> originally<00:00:49.140> said<00:00:49.409> so

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:50.400 
loses what the author originally said so

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.340

moving<00:00:51.180> more<00:00:51.360> toward<00:00:51.629> the<00:00:51.690> center<00:00:52.140> there<00:00:52.320> are

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:52.350 
moving more toward the center there are

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.729 
moving more toward the center there are
two<00:00:52.470> theories<00:00:53.330> one<00:00:54.330> is<00:00:54.510> called<00:00:54.869> the<00:00:55.290> complete

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
two theories one is called the complete

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.859 
two theories one is called the complete
equivalent<00:00:56.670> and<00:00:56.850> the<00:00:57.180> other<00:00:57.390> is<00:00:57.629> called

00:00:57.859 --> 00:00:57.869 
equivalent and the other is called

00:00:57.869 --> 00:01:01.880 
equivalent and the other is called
dynamic<00:00:58.879> equivalent<00:00:59.879> and<00:01:00.089> again<00:01:00.930> this<00:01:01.470> can<00:01:01.739> be

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
dynamic equivalent and again this can be

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.399 
dynamic equivalent and again this can be
very<00:01:02.129> complex<00:01:02.760> but<00:01:03.089> it<00:01:03.239> boils<00:01:03.420> down<00:01:03.659> to<00:01:03.869> this

00:01:04.399 --> 00:01:04.409 
very complex but it boils down to this

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:08.600 
very complex but it boils down to this
the<00:01:05.339> complete<00:01:05.820> equivalent<00:01:06.630> theory<00:01:07.140> says<00:01:07.610> that

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:08.610 
the complete equivalent theory says that

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.840 
the complete equivalent theory says that
we<00:01:08.790> want<00:01:09.090> to<00:01:09.260> translate<00:01:10.260> as<00:01:10.560> much<00:01:11.400> as<00:01:11.580> possible

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:11.850

theory says we're interested in

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
of the text now as you can see once you

adopt that kind of a translation method

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:38.899 
adopt that kind of a translation method
you<00:01:37.320> leave<00:01:37.620> yourself<00:01:37.920> open<00:01:38.400> to

you leave yourself open to

the New King James version of the Bible

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.790 
the New King James version of the Bible

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:49.800 
uses the complete equivalent translation
