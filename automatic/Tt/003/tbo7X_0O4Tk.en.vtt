00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.840 
rubber piece and then close the lid the
seal<00:05:44.720> would<00:05:44.990> then<00:05:45.140> be<00:05:45.290> compromised<00:05:45.919> and<00:05:46.220> the

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:46.850 
seal would then be compromised and the

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:49.300 
seal would then be compromised and the
case<00:05:47.210> would<00:05:47.450> leak<00:05:47.770> obviously<00:05:48.770> damaging<00:05:49.220> your

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:49.310 
case would leak obviously damaging your

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:53.140 
case would leak obviously damaging your

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:55.460 
with no phone in it however it probably

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:56.980 
with no phone in it however it probably
would<00:05:55.610> have<00:05:55.669> failed<00:05:55.970> the<00:05:56.150> water<00:05:56.360> test<00:05:56.660> with<00:05:56.960> my
