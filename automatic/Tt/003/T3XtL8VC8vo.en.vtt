00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:15.790 
one of the common things we do down here

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:19.380 
one of the common things we do down here
is<00:00:16.270> rebuild<00:00:17.260> rotary<00:00:17.650> engines<00:00:18.360> when<00:00:19.360> we

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:19.390 
is rebuild rotary engines when we

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:21.570 
is rebuild rotary engines when we
rebuild<00:00:20.200> rotary<00:00:20.530> engines<00:00:20.920> it<00:00:21.070> really<00:00:21.340> comes

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:21.580 
rebuild rotary engines it really comes

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:24.240 
rebuild rotary engines it really comes
down<00:00:21.670> to<00:00:22.000> what<00:00:22.270> a<00:00:22.450> customer's<00:00:23.080> after<00:00:23.560> what<00:00:24.160> the

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:24.250 
down to what a customer's after what the

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:27.660 
down to what a customer's after what the
purpose<00:00:24.670> of<00:00:24.760> the<00:00:24.850> engine<00:00:25.180> is<00:00:26.250> this<00:00:27.250> one<00:00:27.460> here

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:27.670 
purpose of the engine is this one here

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:30.330 
purpose of the engine is this one here
in<00:00:28.060> front<00:00:28.480> of<00:00:28.540> us<00:00:28.660> is<00:00:28.960> to<00:00:29.140> go<00:00:29.290> into<00:00:29.500> a<00:00:29.650> series

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:30.340 
in front of us is to go into a series

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:33.029 
in front of us is to go into a series
eight<00:00:30.610> rx7<00:00:31.439> which<00:00:32.439> the<00:00:32.619> customer<00:00:33.010> is

00:00:33.029 --> 00:00:33.039 
eight rx7 which the customer is

00:00:33.039 --> 00:00:36.029 
eight rx7 which the customer is
intending<00:00:33.550> on<00:00:33.670> circuit<00:00:34.210> racing<00:00:34.890> for<00:00:35.890> that

00:00:36.029 --> 00:00:36.039 
intending on circuit racing for that

00:00:36.039 --> 00:00:38.759 
intending on circuit racing for that
application<00:00:36.250> we've<00:00:37.000> chosen<00:00:37.329> to<00:00:37.690> go<00:00:37.899> with<00:00:38.739> a

00:00:38.759 --> 00:00:38.769 
application we've chosen to go with a

00:00:38.769 --> 00:00:41.880 
application we've chosen to go with a
stud<00:00:39.309> kit<00:00:39.609> through<00:00:40.149> the<00:00:40.329> housings<00:00:40.839> and<00:00:41.079> and

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:41.890 
stud kit through the housings and and

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:44.819 
stud kit through the housings and and
through<00:00:42.579> his<00:00:42.730> plates<00:00:43.059> this<00:00:43.839> is<00:00:44.050> to<00:00:44.289> increase

00:00:44.819 --> 00:00:44.829 
through his plates this is to increase

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:47.250 
through his plates this is to increase
the<00:00:45.100> rigidity<00:00:45.550> of<00:00:45.579> his<00:00:45.850> motor<00:00:46.120> and<00:00:46.420> stop<00:00:46.839> twist

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:47.260 
the rigidity of his motor and stop twist

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.139 
the rigidity of his motor and stop twist
the<00:00:48.010> other<00:00:48.129> thing<00:00:48.399> we've<00:00:48.519> done<00:00:48.550> with<00:00:48.969> these

00:00:49.139 --> 00:00:49.149 
the other thing we've done with these

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:51.689 
the other thing we've done with these
rotors<00:00:49.659> all<00:00:50.350> these<00:00:50.559> rotors<00:00:50.980> have<00:00:51.100> been<00:00:51.309> side

00:00:51.689 --> 00:00:51.699 
rotors all these rotors have been side

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:54.180 
rotors all these rotors have been side
clearanced<00:00:52.329> which<00:00:52.960> gives<00:00:53.739> us<00:00:53.890> extra

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:54.190 
clearanced which gives us extra

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.090 
clearanced which gives us extra
clearance<00:00:54.579> on<00:00:54.879> the<00:00:55.269> side<00:00:55.659> seals<00:00:56.079> and<00:00:56.440> also<00:00:56.949> the

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:57.100 
clearance on the side seals and also the

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.169 
clearance on the side seals and also the
corner<00:00:57.429> seals<00:00:58.379> and<00:00:59.399> we're<00:01:00.399> always<00:01:00.579> opted<00:01:00.969> to

00:01:01.169 --> 00:01:01.179 
corner seals and we're always opted to

00:01:01.179 --> 00:01:03.389 
corner seals and we're always opted to
use<00:01:01.210> new<00:01:01.629> bearings<00:01:02.170> in<00:01:02.530> all<00:01:02.949> our<00:01:03.129> rotor

00:01:03.389 --> 00:01:03.399 
use new bearings in all our rotor

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:05.700 
use new bearings in all our rotor
assemblies<00:01:04.030> and<00:01:04.210> also<00:01:04.720> in<00:01:04.960> our<00:01:05.080> stationary

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:05.710 
assemblies and also in our stationary

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.400 
assemblies and also in our stationary
gears<00:01:06.010> the<00:01:06.850> other<00:01:07.000> thing<00:01:07.270> we<00:01:07.390> do<00:01:07.600> is<00:01:07.900> we<00:01:08.140> have

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:08.410 
gears the other thing we do is we have

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:11.460 
gears the other thing we do is we have
all<00:01:08.710> our<00:01:09.240> rotating<00:01:10.240> assembly<00:01:10.480> balanced<00:01:11.320> and

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:11.470 
all our rotating assembly balanced and

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:14.580 
all our rotating assembly balanced and
we<00:01:11.680> also<00:01:11.890> get<00:01:12.370> our<00:01:12.520> shafts<00:01:13.290> what<00:01:14.290> we<00:01:14.410> call

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:14.590 
we also get our shafts what we call

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:17.460 
we also get our shafts what we call
isotropic<00:01:15.130> coated<00:01:15.870> this<00:01:16.870> is<00:01:17.020> more<00:01:17.260> of<00:01:17.380> a

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:17.470 
isotropic coated this is more of a

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:21.750 
isotropic coated this is more of a
strength<00:01:18.270> think<00:01:20.250> the<00:01:21.250> other<00:01:21.400> thing<00:01:21.520> that's

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:21.760 
strength think the other thing that's

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.600 
strength think the other thing that's
very<00:01:22.000> critical<00:01:22.690> is<00:01:22.900> the<00:01:23.470> what<00:01:24.220> we<00:01:24.340> call<00:01:24.370> the

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:24.610 
very critical is the what we call the

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:27.120 
very critical is the what we call the
oil<00:01:24.790> control<00:01:25.180> rings<00:01:25.540> on<00:01:25.810> the<00:01:25.930> engine<00:01:26.260> a<00:01:26.560> lot<00:01:27.040> of

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:27.130 
oil control rings on the engine a lot of

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:29.370 
oil control rings on the engine a lot of
people<00:01:27.250> fail<00:01:27.670> to<00:01:27.700> replace<00:01:28.360> certain<00:01:29.080> things

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:29.380 
people fail to replace certain things

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.470 
people fail to replace certain things
like<00:01:29.530> all<00:01:29.770> control<00:01:30.160> rings<00:01:30.400> and<00:01:30.730> different

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:31.480 
like all control rings and different

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:35.940 
like all control rings and different
retaining<00:01:32.470> springs<00:01:32.830> behind<00:01:33.370> them<00:01:34.470> they<00:01:35.470> must

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:35.950 
retaining springs behind them they must

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.310 
retaining springs behind them they must
be<00:01:36.190> replaced<00:01:36.640> to<00:01:36.940> maintain<00:01:37.570> the<00:01:37.720> tension<00:01:38.140> of

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.320 
be replaced to maintain the tension of

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.250 
be replaced to maintain the tension of

apex seals apex seals and side seals are
pretty<00:01:46.900> much<00:01:47.080> like<00:01:47.350> a<00:01:47.380> piston<00:01:47.860> ring<00:01:48.840> they<00:01:49.840> gain

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:50.410 
pretty much like a piston ring they gain

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:55.770 
pretty much like a piston ring they gain
a<00:01:50.770> surface<00:01:52.140> against<00:01:53.140> a<00:01:53.410> rota<00:01:54.070> rota<00:01:55.000> housing<00:01:55.600> is

a surface against a rota rota housing is

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:57.870 
a surface against a rota rota housing is
for<00:01:55.960> the<00:01:56.020> apex<00:01:56.410> seal<00:01:56.650> and<00:01:56.860> then<00:01:57.490> your<00:01:57.640> side

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
for the apex seal and then your side
