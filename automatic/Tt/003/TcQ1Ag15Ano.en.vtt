00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.459
 hey that wave gamers here corvus 

00:00:02.279 --> 00:00:07.620
 bringing them another video this time so that 

00:00:05.459 --> 00:00:10.410
 can unlock faster what 

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:13.349
 the medal has been lobotomized or 

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.910
 shot in the head in onÃ­s stands and good 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:16.260
 they can unlock it pretty fast 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:18.680
 with what is still the gun 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.750
 bolton but good here I will give 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:25.290
 this trick more than anything so that what 

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:28.050
 do more comfortably yes and do not stay 

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:31.590
 without ammunition then we're going to like 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:35.390
 I was going to give you the hill now 150 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:37.579
 limit points and rounds to win 4 

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:40.850
 if we select what is being the 

00:00:37.579 --> 00:00:43.040
 map after bolt equal and we will change 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:46.220
 these weapons that is being the grenade 

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:48.829
 Smoke mortar and what is being 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:51.489
 so that if this is so that it does not 

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:51.489
 the simulation remains 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.559
 and good is the zenith map and we're going to 

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:57.690
 do the same as in the videos 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:59.820
 previous take the one at the point 

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:03.360
 of sale and then go down to the balcony and 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:05.070
 take the ammo left over if this 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.770
 same I repeat to not remain without 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.200
 ammunition and keep making headsets in 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:13.080
 this case the disadvantage of the sniper is 

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:15.659
 that we have to be very accurate to 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:17.850
 shot not because if not then we 

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:19.770
 We spent the 8 shots we have and 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:21.780
 we must again wait for 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:24.240
 ammunition reappears in this 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.500
 case they will be able to shoot with all 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:26.940
 freedom 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.360
 Now let's also take the 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:33.330
 up we go down alarcÃ³n and we take the one that 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:36.590
 is here so that our tricks arise 

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:41.049
 effect and we do not run out of ammunition 

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:41.049
 now we can start shooting 

00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:46.020
 and remember that depending on your 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.420
 skill when the sniper is from the 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.940
 amount of casualties that will be in this 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:54.210
 good case the buttons normal then almost 

00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:56.580
 model for disparate situations to the 

00:01:54.210 --> 00:02:00.080
 head then good because it's not so 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:02.210
 difficult is a matter of what 

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.160
 have a little more practice in the 

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:08.060
 shot do not know more or less to what 

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:10.310
 shoot height and also use it without 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.080
 look what is the joke then not and then 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:14.570
 many make blind shots and it's what 

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:17.150
 that with what they look more in videos of 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:19.730
 youtube that I have seen in this case good 

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:22.400
 I also fired the shot blindly 

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:24.440
 in the state other stoppages and that to me 

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.160
 It makes me more comfortable to do it if it's 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.160
 question of tastes 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:36.500
 we have 21 bullets in total and follow 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.600
 coming out or we are not left without 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:42.620
 ammunition 

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:44.130
 this is also 20 bullets and go back to 

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.730
 leave stockings 

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:49.770
 then the ammunition do not worry 

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:53.910
 same go several shots do not 

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:56.160
 worry that is not not going to have to 

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:58.500
 wait a lot with this trick that I give them 

00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:01.160
 have to wait too long for 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.160
 Ammunition goes out 

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:08.900
 and well the first round is about to 

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:11.600
 finish ammo again 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:14.630
 well I made a total of 22 casualties we 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:16.760
 advise if 22 falls this was with pure 

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:20.620
 sniper and good of those 22 casualties were 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:23.620
 like 11 shots to the head 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:25.380
 Like if you prefer changing maps if 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.480
 they bore a lot in this 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:29.380
 I would also recommend the equipment 

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:32.470
 which has been the 

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:34.840
 the shopping map is nothing else would have 

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:36.390
 than to change what has been the 

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.310
 excavator 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:40.890
 change it for sniper and what 

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:43.650
 is the ink grenades and the 

00:03:40.890 --> 00:03:45.450
 incendiary and that's how the 

00:03:43.650 --> 00:03:48.100
 trick and they would have to have so 

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:50.020
 the pomegranate has been good 

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:53.370
 what is being the excavator sorry 

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:53.370
 first and after grabbing 

00:03:54.030 --> 00:04:02.740
 the map medium and grab the esma and 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:04.300
 persist with the daily gain and that's how it is 

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:06.940
 as they could do in a map of 

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:10.300
 shopping yes, if you get bored 

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:14.190
 much this map is another tip so what 

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:14.190
 can do in a different map 

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:27.750
 remember that this medal can 

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:29.850
 take a little more time than with the 

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:32.340
 we have done about 22 minutes 

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:34.710
 split since you need a little more than 

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:37.710
 precision and good because they have to 

00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:40.620
 shoot to recharge and then that takes away 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:42.030
 a little more time than usual but 

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:44.289
 possible to be constant 

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:46.509
 there is also up to launch 

00:04:44.289 --> 00:04:48.399
 now if they were to be in another type 

00:04:46.509 --> 00:04:51.009
 of game that is being executed or 

00:04:48.399 --> 00:04:52.719
 war zone if they can bring down their 

00:04:51.009 --> 00:04:54.580
 opponent and with the cannon gun a 

00:04:52.719 --> 00:04:56.680
 cut effect of the headshot are three 

00:04:54.580 --> 00:05:01.139
 shots are two shots to the body and the 

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:01.139
 head of a perfect headset 

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:09.210
 and the game is about to end if 

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:11.100
 me with everything about 19 minutes 

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:12.520
 I think the Christian of minutes if not 

00:05:11.100 --> 00:05:14.520
 They are 22 

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:18.689
 but good 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:20.939
 The same is necessary 

00:05:18.689 --> 00:05:22.489
 have patience not because this medal 

00:05:20.939 --> 00:05:25.099
 It is a bit difficult 

00:05:22.489 --> 00:05:28.019
 good hard for those who do not know 

00:05:25.099 --> 00:05:31.169
 use the cards but you can still 

00:05:28.019 --> 00:05:34.549
 do with the shotgun online then 

00:05:31.169 --> 00:05:34.549
 comes out a lot of exercise 

00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:42.840
 and well we miss to finish then 

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:47.940
 show them how many shots in the head 

00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:50.160
 we did in 22 minutes we have 160 and I think 

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:52.530
 that at the beginning of the video we had 101 

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:54.180
 shots to the head here good if 

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:57.360
 like to go back the video and see from 

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:59.520
 the principle to be checked 

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:01.200
 I think they said 101 101 shots from 

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:03.750
 the beginning 

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:06.480
 we made a total of 59 shots at the 

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:09.090
 head in just 22 minutes I repeat if 

00:06:06.480 --> 00:06:11.130
 you want to do it with the gun 

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:15.480
 ball top so they can work 

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:17.040
 in the master's medal pistol then 

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:18.960
 they can change the configuration of 

00:06:17.040 --> 00:06:21.240
 weapons and change those that already 

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:23.760
 we put at the beginning and they will never stay 

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:26.270
 without ammunition and good guys that would be 

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:29.270
 all comments will qualify subscribe 

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:29.270
 bye
