00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 what took you 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:09.150
 when I deceive them she never 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:11.990
 learned it's not she who approaches the 

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.990
 same time 10 months 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:31.390
 maÃ¯wenn title 

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:33.380
 of the film makes it a double meaning 

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:36.230
 because it's a woman's story 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:40.040
 60 years old who leaves on the roads 

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:42.649
 a road movie but that crosses this 

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:45.300
 trip she is going 

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:47.910
 finally will open up to her a new 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.550
 horizon in a life that had none 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.140
 not before the starting point it is very 

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:53.430
 simple is not the film at all 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:56.100
 Catherine Deneuve 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.260
 it's my desire to work with her 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.000
 and write for her but when I got 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.300
 this envy I had no idea of 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:14.340
 scenario no idea of the story and 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:19.289
 it came little by little excuse me 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:21.899
 is quits charlie charlie 

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:23.700
 I come to a stop but a few years 

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:26.250
 it's not true Charlie I stop you 

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.220
 since I had been offered to adapt a 

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:30.810
 book that I like and moderately 

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:32.220
 but there was a role for a woman from 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.780
 60 years old I thought it's an opportunity 

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.580
 to work with catherine deneuve 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.990
 I met him on this occasion 

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.819
 because I had asked if she 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.780
 wanted to read the book well and tell me if 

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:42.060
 it might interest him 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:43.770
 so she had told me yes okay you 

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.360
 can write the scenario is fleeing 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:48.060
 when I started writing 

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:50.880
 I did not want to tell 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.850
 this story and I called catherine 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:57.000
 to say that I was giving up and 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:58.439
 she was so disappointed she told me 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.329
 oh but it was still lucky to 

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:01.500
 work with you and all that when 

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:02.399
 I hung up I said to myself but must 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.409
 not that I stop there you have to 

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:06.600
 I absolutely write a movie for her 

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:07.799
 now I must not wait and 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.880
 that's how I started 

00:02:07.799 --> 00:02:11.220
 to write 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:12.269
 it sounds my way but I do not have it 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:13.830
 not spoken 

00:02:12.269 --> 00:02:16.920
 serge is written during 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.240
 eight months without telling him that I was writing 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.800
 for her and one day I called them 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.330
 I said here I wrote a script 

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.670
 for you is what you want the 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.770
 book and after once she read it 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:27.420
 we met again I think 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:28.980
 that it's someone who has a huge 

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:30.960
 respect for the director is 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.370
 quite rare among the actors I 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:35.920
 the impression that to the consciousness of 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:38.580
 work than what it is and two 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.540
 peace we need to be able to 

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.400
 it's not at all someone who is of a 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.830
 conflict and so it's leaving it a 

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.420
 great comfort for the directors 

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:47.980
 many people have a picture of 

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:49.330
 catherine like someone cold enough 

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:52.960
 enough 

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:54.270
 remote definitely did not know so I 

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:55.440
 very quickly 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:57.670
 when I met them understood 

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:59.690
 that she was not at all 

00:02:57.670 --> 00:03:01.220
 that person 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:02.630
 the image of what we have of her 

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:04.070
 maybe glossy paper I do not know where from 

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:05.510
 it comes this image and this 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:06.280
 reputation because it's really cool 

00:03:05.510 --> 00:03:08.990
 reverse 

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:12.260
 and so it's true that I wanted 

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:14.360
 to highlight this aspect of his 

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:15.890
 personality is already very bright with 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.790
 even a huge joy of life 

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:18.790
 she loves to laugh 

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.710
 she loves children yes finally everything 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:26.340
 what you said I wanted to see 

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:30.060
 his beautiful perhaps more con we have seen 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:33.569
 in most of his films until 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:40.110
 that I want we do not know do not do 

00:03:33.569 --> 00:03:43.580
 hair coach also this effort to games 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:43.580
 like little lips 

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:47.230
 I want to travel
