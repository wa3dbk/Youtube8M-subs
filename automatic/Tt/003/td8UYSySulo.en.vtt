00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:34.720 
F point f80 let's just zoom right into

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:40.280 
F point f80 let's just zoom right into
21<00:02:35.290> X<00:02:35.549> and<00:02:36.549> we'll<00:02:36.910> go<00:02:37.060> to<00:02:37.120> the<00:02:37.359> F<00:02:37.570> setting<00:02:37.989> again

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:40.290 
21 X and we'll go to the F setting again

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:46.580 
21 X and we'll go to the F setting again
lowest<00:02:41.189> is<00:02:41.400> f<00:02:42.349> 5.9<00:02:44.120> there<00:02:45.260> let's<00:02:46.260> just<00:02:46.290> pull

and we're straight into Android so

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:55.689 
and we're straight into Android so
they've<00:04:52.669> done<00:04:52.849> a<00:04:53.059> really<00:04:53.569> good<00:04:54.080> job<00:04:54.139> of<00:04:54.800> doing

they've done a really good job of doing

00:04:55.699 --> 00:04:57.850 
they've done a really good job of doing
something<00:04:56.149> that<00:04:56.419> makes<00:04:56.569> Android<00:04:57.139> but<00:04:57.349> really

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:57.860 
something that makes Android but really

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:00.040

careful if you're using this is an
all-day<00:05:59.240> camera<00:06:00.099> let's<00:06:01.099> just<00:06:01.219> quickly<00:06:01.370> go

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:01.490 
all-day camera let's just quickly go

00:06:01.490 --> 00:06:03.860 
all-day camera let's just quickly go
around<00:06:01.729> the<00:06:01.819> device

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:03.870 
around the device

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:06.380 
around the device
so<00:06:04.500> in<00:06:04.650> terms<00:06:04.800> of<00:06:04.950> ports<00:06:05.310> there<00:06:05.550> you've<00:06:05.790> got<00:06:05.820> a

00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:06.390 
so in terms of ports there you've got a

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:09.290 
so in terms of ports there you've got a
microphone<00:06:07.310> it's<00:06:08.310> at<00:06:08.400> a<00:06:08.430> headphone<00:06:08.820> I'm<00:06:09.090> sure

it's a headphone out and not headphone

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:13.670 
it's a headphone out and not headphone
in<00:06:11.360> there's<00:06:12.360> a<00:06:12.450> USB<00:06:12.900> port<00:06:13.230> they're<00:06:13.410> not<00:06:13.560> sure

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:13.680 
in there's a USB port they're not sure

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:15.380 
in there's a USB port they're not sure

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:39.950 
terms of build quality actually do you
think<00:06:38.610> about<00:06:38.700> it<00:06:38.970> there's<00:06:39.510> not<00:06:39.690> a<00:06:39.750> lot<00:06:39.930> of

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:39.960 
think about it there's not a lot of

00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:41.360 
think about it there's not a lot of
manual<00:06:40.260> control<00:06:40.740> on<00:06:40.920> here<00:06:41.100> which<00:06:41.220> actually

manual control on here which actually

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:43.730 
manual control on here which actually
makes<00:06:41.700> a<00:06:41.940> lot<00:06:42.000> of<00:06:42.180> sense<00:06:42.380> that<00:06:43.380> this<00:06:43.470> is<00:06:43.650> the

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:43.740 
makes a lot of sense that this is the

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:51.570 
sturdy it's not super lightweight or

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:54.110 
sturdy it's not super lightweight or
anything<00:06:51.900> there's<00:06:52.500> a<00:06:52.590> nice<00:06:52.820> elastic<00:06:53.820> finish

on the side there it's not rubber or
anything<00:06:57.140> feels<00:06:58.140> a<00:06:58.230> bit<00:06:58.320> warm<00:06:58.590> now<00:06:58.740> I<00:06:58.770> have<00:06:58.920> to

00:06:59.030 --> 00:06:59.040 
anything feels a bit warm now I have to

00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:02.150 
anything feels a bit warm now I have to
say<00:06:59.220> it's<00:06:59.280> been<00:06:59.910> on<00:07:00.000> 20<00:07:00.540> 25<00:07:01.320> 30<00:07:01.650> minutes<00:07:01.980> it

00:07:02.150 --> 00:07:02.160 
say it's been on 20 25 30 minutes it

00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:05.120 
say it's been on 20 25 30 minutes it
feel<00:07:02.400> a<00:07:02.430> little<00:07:02.700> bit<00:07:02.910> warm<00:07:03.180> but<00:07:03.500> you<00:07:04.500> probably

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:05.130 
feel a little bit warm but you probably

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:07.910 
feel a little bit warm but you probably
won't<00:07:05.400> be<00:07:05.700> using<00:07:05.880> this<00:07:06.380> 30<00:07:07.380> minutes<00:07:07.770> at<00:07:07.890> a

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:07.920 
won't be using this 30 minutes at a

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:10.790 
won't be using this 30 minutes at a
stretch<00:07:07.980> anyway

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:10.800 

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:14.060 

so<00:07:11.800> that's<00:07:11.980> the<00:07:12.190> Samsung<00:07:12.790> Galaxy<00:07:12.820> camera

00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:14.070 
so that's the Samsung Galaxy camera

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:17.250 
so that's the Samsung Galaxy camera
