led<00:01:43.890> to<00:01:44.009> a<00:01:44.040> dangerous<00:01:44.310> contact<00:01:45.030> charge<00:01:45.299> and

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:45.600 
led to a dangerous contact charge and

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.090 
led to a dangerous contact charge and
why<00:01:45.750> it<00:01:45.810> was<00:01:45.990> considered<00:01:46.439> a<00:01:46.530> grade<00:01:46.950> two

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
why it was considered a grade two

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.730 
why it was considered a grade two
offense<00:01:47.540> Jack<00:01:48.540> I<00:01:48.659> think<00:01:48.869> the<00:01:48.960> first<00:01:49.170> and<00:01:49.619> the

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
offense Jack I think the first and the

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:50.990 
offense Jack I think the first and the
key<00:01:49.979> element<00:01:50.280> to<00:01:50.310> this<00:01:50.460> is<00:01:50.670> that<00:01:50.820> it<00:01:50.909> was

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
key element to this is that it was

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.389 
key element to this is that it was
considered<00:01:51.479> careless<00:01:51.899> and<00:01:52.079> hence<00:01:52.799> the<00:01:52.979> reason

00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
considered careless and hence the reason

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.399 
considered careless and hence the reason
for<00:01:53.700> the<00:01:53.759> charge<00:01:54.030> then<00:01:54.600> we<00:01:54.720> see<00:01:54.869> the<00:01:54.990> dangerous

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
for the charge then we see the dangerous

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:56.899 
for the charge then we see the dangerous
and<00:01:55.590> force<00:01:55.770> will<00:01:55.950> contact<00:01:56.310> at<00:01:56.460> the<00:01:56.490> leg<00:01:56.700> of<00:01:56.820> the

00:01:56.899 --> 00:01:56.909 
and force will contact at the leg of the

00:01:56.909 --> 00:01:59.179 
and force will contact at the leg of the
kicker<00:01:57.149> you<00:01:58.110> can<00:01:58.259> see<00:01:58.439> there<00:01:58.619> he<00:01:58.740> does<00:01:58.950> make

00:01:59.179 --> 00:01:59.189 
kicker you can see there he does make

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:00.620 
kicker you can see there he does make
