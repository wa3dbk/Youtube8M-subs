need<00:04:33.360> is<00:04:33.540> a<00:04:33.570> little<00:04:33.840> bit<00:04:34.050> of<00:04:34.229> product<00:04:34.650> on<00:04:34.800> a

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:36.030 
lease and it makes the biggest

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:38.090 
lease and it makes the biggest
difference<00:04:36.300> because<00:04:36.840> she<00:04:37.470> has<00:04:37.650> more<00:04:37.889> of<00:04:37.949> a

which<00:05:43.470> is<00:05:43.680> smaller<00:05:44.580> I'm<00:05:45.000> gonna<00:05:45.150> go<00:05:45.479> into<00:05:45.780> that

00:05:45.950 --> 00:05:45.960 
which is smaller I'm gonna go into that

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:50.300 
which is smaller I'm gonna go into that
crease<00:05:46.349> and<00:05:47.180> be<00:05:48.180> more<00:05:48.450> specific<00:05:49.110> like<00:05:49.770> apply

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:50.310 
crease and be more specific like apply

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:52.070 
crease and be more specific like apply
it<00:05:50.370> more<00:05:50.639> to<00:05:50.820> the<00:05:50.940> outer<00:05:51.120> corner<00:05:51.750> and<00:05:51.780> then

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:52.080 
it more to the outer corner and then

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:53.750 
it more to the outer corner and then
bring<00:05:52.440> it<00:05:52.590> all<00:05:52.740> the<00:05:52.860> way<00:05:52.979> into<00:05:53.220> the<00:05:53.610> inner

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:53.760 
bring it all the way into the inner

00:05:53.760 --> 00:05:58.550 
bring it all the way into the inner
corner<00:05:53.940> so<00:05:54.810> it<00:05:55.169> makes<00:05:55.530> the<00:05:56.039> depth<00:05:57.229> more<00:05:58.229> of

00:05:58.550 --> 00:05:58.560 
corner so it makes the depth more of

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:00.620 
corner so it makes the depth more of
course<00:05:58.949> it's<00:05:59.460> really<00:05:59.729> difficult<00:05:59.910> to<00:06:00.210> do<00:06:00.449> this

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:00.630 
course it's really difficult to do this

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:03.290 
course it's really difficult to do this

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:17.910 
I would suggest with an eyeshadow this

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:20.060 
I would suggest with an eyeshadow this
is<00:06:18.150> espresso<00:06:18.990> you<00:06:19.110> can<00:06:19.289> use<00:06:19.440> anything<00:06:19.710> else

00:06:20.060 --> 00:06:20.070 
is espresso you can use anything else

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:23.810 
is espresso you can use anything else
like<00:06:20.310> and<00:06:20.550> bark<00:06:21.240> even<00:06:21.510> and<00:06:22.250> so<00:06:23.250> you<00:06:23.340> see<00:06:23.639> it

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:23.820 
like and bark even and so you see it

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:26.719 
like and bark even and so you see it
gives<00:06:24.210> more<00:06:24.419> depth<00:06:24.690> to<00:06:24.810> the<00:06:24.930> eyes<00:06:25.580> but<00:06:26.580> it's

00:06:26.719 --> 00:06:26.729 
gives more depth to the eyes but it's

00:06:26.729 --> 00:06:28.850 
gives more depth to the eyes but it's
not<00:06:26.910> as<00:06:27.060> harsh<00:06:27.330> as<00:06:27.510> eyeliner<00:06:27.990> especially
