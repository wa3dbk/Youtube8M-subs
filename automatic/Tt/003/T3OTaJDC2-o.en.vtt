00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:43.310 
let me just show you it may be easier

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:49.450 
let me just show you it may be easier
just<00:00:43.989> taking<00:00:44.989> my<00:00:45.530> ruler<00:00:47.079> large<00:00:48.079> t-square<00:00:48.650> it's

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:49.460 
just taking my ruler large t-square it's

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.260 
just taking my ruler large t-square it's
two<00:00:49.700> inches<00:00:50.059> wide<00:00:50.739> drawn<00:00:51.760> the<00:00:52.760> line<00:00:52.970> on<00:00:53.150> the

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:53.270 
two inches wide drawn the line on the

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:55.420 
two inches wide drawn the line on the
top<00:00:53.450> and<00:00:53.660> line<00:00:53.840> on<00:00:54.020> the<00:00:54.110> bottom<00:00:54.410> didn't<00:00:55.280> move

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:55.430 
top and line on the bottom didn't move

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.729 
top and line on the bottom didn't move
down<00:00:55.700> and<00:00:56.120> drew<00:00:56.360> another<00:00:56.600> line<00:00:56.720> that<00:00:57.590> way<00:00:57.710> I

00:00:57.729 --> 00:00:57.739 
down and drew another line that way I

00:00:57.739 --> 00:00:59.910 
down and drew another line that way I
have<00:00:58.040> three<00:00:58.460> lines<00:00:58.640> that<00:00:59.210> are<00:00:59.390> all

00:00:59.910 --> 00:00:59.920 
have three lines that are all

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.740 
have three lines that are all
equidistant<00:01:00.920> apart<00:01:00.980> 2<00:01:01.850> inches<00:01:02.090> here<00:01:02.239> 2<00:01:02.510> inches

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:02.750 
equidistant apart 2 inches here 2 inches

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:07.630 
equidistant apart 2 inches here 2 inches
here<00:01:03.400> this<00:01:04.400> piece<00:01:04.670> is<00:01:04.970> 16<00:01:05.570> inches<00:01:05.960> long<00:01:06.640> or

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:07.640 
here this piece is 16 inches long or

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.630 
here this piece is 16 inches long or
wide<00:01:07.970> depending<00:01:08.570> on<00:01:08.660> how<00:01:08.780> you<00:01:08.840> look<00:01:09.110> at<00:01:09.259> it<00:01:09.640> so

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:10.640 
wide depending on how you look at it so

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.370 
wide depending on how you look at it so
I<00:01:10.970> have<00:01:11.270> divided<00:01:11.750> that<00:01:11.930> into<00:01:12.820> three<00:01:14.380> four-foot

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:15.380 
I have divided that into three four-foot

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.100 
I have divided that into three four-foot
or<00:01:15.830> 4<00:01:16.130> inch<00:01:16.310> sections<00:01:16.850> and<00:01:17.090> that's<00:01:17.810> going<00:01:18.050> to

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:18.110 
or 4 inch sections and that's going to

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.040 
or 4 inch sections and that's going to
leave<00:01:18.289> the<00:01:18.860> extra<00:01:19.220> 2<00:01:19.399> inch<00:01:19.580> gap<00:01:19.850> here<00:01:20.210> in<00:01:20.360> two

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:21.050 
leave the extra 2 inch gap here in two

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:22.469 
leave the extra 2 inch gap here in two
inch<00:01:21.229> gap<00:01:21.500> here

00:01:22.469 --> 00:01:22.479 
inch gap here

00:01:22.479 --> 00:01:26.350 
inch gap here
so<00:01:23.560> we<00:01:24.560> have<00:01:24.710> 4<00:01:25.009> inches<00:01:25.250> in<00:01:25.399> the<00:01:25.490> middle<00:01:25.789> 4

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:26.360 
so we have 4 inches in the middle 4

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.830 
so we have 4 inches in the middle 4
inches<00:01:26.600> on<00:01:26.720> the<00:01:26.840> end<00:01:27.020> 4<00:01:27.649> inches<00:01:27.920> on<00:01:28.100> this<00:01:28.280> end<00:01:28.840> 4

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:29.840 
inches on the end 4 inches on this end 4

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.290 
inches on the end 4 inches on this end 4
inches<00:01:30.140> down<00:01:30.350> here<00:01:30.830> 4<00:01:31.550> inches<00:01:31.789> down<00:01:31.970> here

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:32.300 
inches down here 4 inches down here

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.320 
inches down here 4 inches down here
those<00:01:32.840> are<00:01:32.869> the<00:01:33.110> immediate<00:01:33.740> lines<00:01:34.100> now<00:01:35.060> in<00:01:35.210> the

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:35.330 
those are the immediate lines now in the

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:38.800 
those are the immediate lines now in the
center<00:01:35.630> here<00:01:35.899> instead<00:01:36.770> of<00:01:37.270> going<00:01:38.270> with<00:01:38.420> that<00:01:38.600> 2

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810 
center here instead of going with that 2

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.469 
center here instead of going with that 2
inch<00:01:39.020> differential<00:01:39.710> I've<00:01:40.280> come<00:01:40.610> in<00:01:40.850> two<00:01:41.300> and<00:01:41.450> a

00:01:41.469 --> 00:01:41.479 
inch differential I've come in two and a

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:42.760 
inch differential I've come in two and a
half<00:01:41.660> inches<00:01:42.020> to<00:01:42.170> this<00:01:42.350> point

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:42.770 
half inches to this point

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.999 
half inches to this point
and<00:01:42.979> to<00:01:43.729> this<00:01:43.850> point<00:01:44.350> this<00:01:45.350> would<00:01:45.619> be<00:01:45.770> the

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:46.009 
and to this point this would be the

00:01:46.009 --> 00:01:49.810 
and to this point this would be the
normal<00:01:46.220> 2<00:01:46.909> inch<00:01:47.119> line<00:01:47.420> but<00:01:48.320> the<00:01:49.009> area<00:01:49.400> in<00:01:49.520> here

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:49.820 
normal 2 inch line but the area in here

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.219 
normal 2 inch line but the area in here
was<00:01:50.210> just<00:01:50.240> too<00:01:50.810> small

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:51.229 
was just too small

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:55.899 
was just too small
in<00:01:51.500> my<00:01:51.799> opinion<00:01:52.900> only<00:01:53.900> giving<00:01:54.200> two<00:01:54.380> inches<00:01:54.710> of

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:55.909 
in my opinion only giving two inches of

00:01:55.909 --> 00:01:58.300 
in my opinion only giving two inches of
clearance<00:01:56.840> moving<00:01:57.409> from<00:01:57.560> this<00:01:57.710> area<00:01:58.009> to<00:01:58.130> this

00:01:58.300 --> 00:01:58.310 
clearance moving from this area to this

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.940 
clearance moving from this area to this
so<00:01:59.060> I<00:01:59.119> widen<00:01:59.780> this<00:01:59.899> out<00:02:00.140> another<00:02:00.289> half<00:02:00.619> an<00:02:00.770> inch

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:00.950 
so I widen this out another half an inch

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:02.739 
so I widen this out another half an inch
and<00:02:01.520> I<00:02:01.609> think<00:02:01.850> that<00:02:01.999> made<00:02:02.210> a<00:02:02.240> really<00:02:02.509> big

00:02:02.739 --> 00:02:02.749 
and I think that made a really big

00:02:02.749 --> 00:02:06.880 
and I think that made a really big
difference<00:02:02.960> so<00:02:05.229> first<00:02:06.229> thing<00:02:06.439> we<00:02:06.530> need<00:02:06.649> to<00:02:06.679> do

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890 
difference so first thing we need to do

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:14.289 
difference so first thing we need to do
is<00:02:07.840> take<00:02:08.840> our<00:02:09.910> trusty<00:02:10.910> blade<00:02:13.150> what<00:02:14.150> we're

00:02:14.289 --> 00:02:14.299 
is take our trusty blade what we're

00:02:14.299 --> 00:02:18.309 
is take our trusty blade what we're
going<00:02:14.480> to<00:02:14.540> do<00:02:15.610> sorry<00:02:16.610> for<00:02:16.849> that<00:02:17.319> scratchy

00:02:18.309 --> 00:02:18.319 
going to do sorry for that scratchy

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:23.229 
going to do sorry for that scratchy
sound<00:02:18.680> as<00:02:18.950> it<00:02:19.069> moves<00:02:19.750> but<00:02:20.750> we<00:02:20.930> need<00:02:21.140> to<00:02:22.239> go

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:23.239 
sound as it moves but we need to go

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:29.050 
sound as it moves but we need to go
ahead<00:02:23.330> and<00:02:23.720> start<00:02:24.500> cutting<00:02:24.920> our<00:02:25.099> lawns<00:02:28.060> I'm

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:29.060 
ahead and start cutting our lawns I'm

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.229 
ahead and start cutting our lawns I'm
just<00:02:29.360> going<00:02:29.540> to<00:02:29.599> do<00:02:29.810> a<00:02:30.220> shallow<00:02:31.220> pass<00:02:31.640> to<00:02:31.910> begin

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:32.239 
just going to do a shallow pass to begin

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:37.300 
just going to do a shallow pass to begin
with

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:37.310 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.470 

so<00:02:37.850> I'm<00:02:38.150> going<00:02:38.390> to<00:02:38.450> do<00:02:38.600> that<00:02:38.840> on<00:02:39.650> each<00:02:40.459> of<00:02:41.330> the

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:41.480 
so I'm going to do that on each of the

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.610 
so I'm going to do that on each of the
lines<00:02:41.510> on<00:02:42.260> the<00:02:42.560> outside

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:44.620 
lines on the outside

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:30.460 
we want just the head to be sticking out

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:33.600 
we want just the head to be sticking out
so<00:03:31.080> what<00:03:32.080> I'm<00:03:32.170> going<00:03:32.410> to<00:03:32.440> do<00:03:32.650> is<00:03:32.920> lock<00:03:33.130> my<00:03:33.370> blade

so what I'm going to do is lock my blade

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:40.280 
so what I'm going to do is lock my blade
in<00:03:33.820> place<00:03:33.850> at<00:03:34.420> that<00:03:34.450> point<00:03:37.020> then

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:44.470 

I'm<00:03:40.829> going<00:03:41.189> to<00:03:41.370> cut<00:03:42.110> down<00:03:43.110> until<00:03:43.650> my<00:03:43.680> knife

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:12.190 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:15.330 

we're<00:04:12.700> going<00:04:12.820> to<00:04:12.880> do<00:04:13.030> that<00:04:13.240> on<00:04:13.950> all<00:04:14.950> of<00:04:15.220> the

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:31.000 
have deepened the lines at this specific

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.860 
have deepened the lines at this specific
blade<00:04:31.690> depth<00:04:32.430> all<00:04:33.430> the<00:04:33.490> way<00:04:33.730> around<00:04:34.240> all<00:04:34.810> of

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:34.870 
blade depth all the way around all of

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:38.450 
blade depth all the way around all of
the<00:04:35.140> edges<00:04:35.430> so<00:04:36.430> what<00:04:36.580> I<00:04:36.610> need<00:04:36.820> to<00:04:36.940> do<00:04:37.030> now<00:04:37.440> since

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:38.460 
the edges so what I need to do now since

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:40.920 
the edges so what I need to do now since
we're<00:04:39.460> doing<00:04:39.610> this<00:04:39.880> all<00:04:40.150> on<00:04:40.450> one<00:04:40.480> piece

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:40.930 
we're doing this all on one piece

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:43.230 
we're doing this all on one piece
instead<00:04:41.680> of<00:04:41.920> just<00:04:42.580> cutting<00:04:42.850> all<00:04:43.090> the<00:04:43.210> way

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:43.240 
instead of just cutting all the way

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:46.470 
instead of just cutting all the way
through<00:04:43.360> and<00:04:44.020> using<00:04:44.710> a<00:04:44.950> base<00:04:45.190> to<00:04:46.000> stick<00:04:46.330> the

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:46.480 
through and using a base to stick the

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:49.500 
through and using a base to stick the
two<00:04:46.510> pieces<00:04:46.900> on<00:04:47.230> which<00:04:47.950> you<00:04:48.070> can<00:04:48.250> do<00:04:48.490> I<00:04:48.760> was

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:49.510 
two pieces on which you can do I was

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:52.680 
two pieces on which you can do I was
just<00:04:49.780> asked<00:04:50.230> to<00:04:50.350> do<00:04:50.470> it<00:04:50.590> on<00:04:51.130> a<00:04:51.160> solid<00:04:51.640> piece<00:04:51.820> so

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:52.690 
just asked to do it on a solid piece so

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:56.190 
just asked to do it on a solid piece so
what<00:04:53.110> we<00:04:53.230> need<00:04:53.380> to<00:04:53.470> do<00:04:53.560> now<00:04:53.770> is<00:04:54.220> find<00:04:55.150> a<00:04:55.360> way<00:04:55.510> to

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:56.200 
what we need to do now is find a way to

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.290 
what we need to do now is find a way to
get<00:04:56.350> this<00:04:56.530> middle<00:04:56.830> piece<00:04:56.950> out<00:04:57.190> there<00:04:58.180> are<00:04:58.240> a

00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:58.300 
get this middle piece out there are a

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:00.200 
get this middle piece out there are a
few<00:04:58.450> different<00:04:58.720> ways<00:04:58.810> you<00:04:58.870> can<00:04:59.170> do<00:04:59.320> it<00:04:59.350> you<00:05:00.130> can

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:00.210 
few different ways you can do it you can

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:05.760 
few different ways you can do it you can
start<00:05:01.210> slicing<00:05:01.870> away<00:05:02.260> and<00:05:04.020> just<00:05:05.020> just<00:05:05.470> do<00:05:05.620> the

00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:05.770 
start slicing away and just just do the

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:08.970 
start slicing away and just just do the
insides<00:05:06.250> you<00:05:06.640> can<00:05:07.240> take<00:05:07.450> a<00:05:07.810> wood<00:05:08.170> rasp<00:05:08.410> and

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:08.980 
insides you can take a wood rasp and

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:11.940 
insides you can take a wood rasp and
start<00:05:09.520> sanding<00:05:09.820> it<00:05:10.120> all<00:05:10.270> out<00:05:10.590> you<00:05:11.590> can<00:05:11.620> take<00:05:11.890> a

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:11.950 
start sanding it all out you can take a

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:16.410 
start sanding it all out you can take a
router<00:05:12.400> with<00:05:13.680> just<00:05:14.680> a<00:05:14.770> regular<00:05:14.950> router<00:05:15.910> bit<00:05:16.180> on

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:16.420 
router with just a regular router bit on

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:19.910 
router with just a regular router bit on
it<00:05:16.600> and<00:05:16.890> rout<00:05:17.890> out<00:05:17.920> the<00:05:18.220> lines<00:05:18.430> that<00:05:19.150> works<00:05:19.390> too

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:19.920 
it and rout out the lines that works too

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:23.340 
it and rout out the lines that works too
if<00:05:20.920> you<00:05:21.070> don't<00:05:21.280> have<00:05:21.490> any<00:05:21.730> of<00:05:21.820> those<00:05:21.940> tools<00:05:22.350> the

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:23.350 
if you don't have any of those tools the

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:25.920 
if you don't have any of those tools the
easiest<00:05:23.770> way<00:05:24.040> in<00:05:24.250> my<00:05:24.400> opinion<00:05:24.610> to<00:05:24.820> do<00:05:25.030> it<00:05:25.150> is<00:05:25.660> to

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:25.930 
easiest way in my opinion to do it is to

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:30.390 
easiest way in my opinion to do it is to
keep<00:05:26.050> the<00:05:26.260> same<00:05:26.500> blade<00:05:26.740> depth<00:05:27.390> and<00:05:29.250> just<00:05:30.250> go

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:30.400 
keep the same blade depth and just go

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:35.040 
keep the same blade depth and just go
over<00:05:30.430> a<00:05:30.940> little<00:05:31.210> bit<00:05:31.420> and<00:05:31.690> start<00:05:32.620> sawing<00:05:34.050> okay

00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:35.050 
over a little bit and start sawing okay

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:36.900 
over a little bit and start sawing okay
so<00:05:35.110> I<00:05:35.260> ended<00:05:35.590> up<00:05:35.680> losing<00:05:35.980> an<00:05:36.280> entire<00:05:36.580> segment

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:36.910 
so I ended up losing an entire segment

00:05:36.910 --> 00:05:38.700 
so I ended up losing an entire segment
because<00:05:37.420> I<00:05:37.600> thought<00:05:37.780> I<00:05:37.840> was<00:05:37.990> recording<00:05:38.290> in<00:05:38.590> it

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:38.710 
because I thought I was recording in it

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:41.300 
because I thought I was recording in it
wasn't<00:05:39.070> so<00:05:39.880> yay<00:05:40.840> for<00:05:41.080> me

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:41.310 
wasn't so yay for me

00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:46.219 
wasn't so yay for me
this<00:05:42.310> is<00:05:42.400> hot<00:05:42.580> is<00:05:42.760> done<00:05:43.920> kind<00:05:44.920> of<00:05:44.980> get<00:05:45.100> an<00:05:45.190> idea

00:05:46.219 --> 00:05:46.229

what it looks like or what it is going
to<00:05:49.300> look<00:05:49.449> like<00:05:49.500> so<00:05:50.500> let's<00:05:50.680> try<00:05:50.860> this<00:05:50.919> again

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:53.280 

00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:57.689 

what<00:05:54.280> I'm<00:05:54.370> going<00:05:54.610> to<00:05:54.669> do<00:05:55.080> is<00:05:56.100> concentrate<00:05:57.100> on

what I'm going to do is concentrate on
this<00:05:58.000> area<00:05:58.360> since<00:05:59.289> it's<00:05:59.500> going<00:05:59.680> to<00:05:59.800> be<00:05:59.919> removed

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:00.990

00:06:22.379 --> 00:06:22.389 
cut all the way down to this line and

00:06:22.389 --> 00:06:23.730 
cut all the way down to this line and
then<00:06:22.570> I'm<00:06:22.630> going<00:06:22.810> to<00:06:22.870> come<00:06:23.080> in<00:06:23.229> right<00:06:23.410> inside
