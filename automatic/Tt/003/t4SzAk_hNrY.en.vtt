tonight now you know I've been told

00:05:33.780 --> 00:05:35.089 
tonight now you know I've been told
personally<00:05:34.199> this<00:05:34.349> can<00:05:34.500> be<00:05:34.590> completely

00:05:35.089 --> 00:05:35.099 
personally this can be completely

00:05:35.099 --> 00:05:37.070 
personally this can be completely
different<00:05:35.669> but<00:05:35.910> then<00:05:36.330> when<00:05:36.479> you<00:05:36.599> look<00:05:36.810> at<00:05:36.960> your

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:37.080 
different but then when you look at your

00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.650 
different but then when you look at your
top<00:05:37.320> three<00:05:37.710> in<00:05:37.860> a<00:05:37.949> show<00:05:38.360> like<00:05:39.360> you're<00:05:39.510> talking

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:39.660 
top three in a show like you're talking

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:42.439 
top three in a show like you're talking
it's<00:05:39.990> really<00:05:40.289> really<00:05:40.830> close<00:05:41.099> right<00:05:41.490> like

00:05:42.439 --> 00:05:42.449 
it's really really close right like

00:05:42.449 --> 00:05:44.719 
it's really really close right like
doing<00:05:43.110> lien<00:05:43.320> is<00:05:43.500> typically<00:05:44.070> it<00:05:44.250> is<00:05:44.280> but

00:05:44.719 --> 00:05:44.729 
doing lien is typically it is but

00:05:44.729 --> 00:05:46.070 
doing lien is typically it is but
there's<00:05:44.940> not<00:05:45.300> a<00:05:45.330> big<00:05:45.570> difference<00:05:45.960> between

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:46.080 
there's not a big difference between

00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:48.649 
there's not a big difference between
first<00:05:46.650> and<00:05:46.830> second<00:05:47.280> or<00:05:47.490> first<00:05:47.520> and<00:05:48.060> third<00:05:48.300> even

00:05:48.649 --> 00:05:48.659 
first and second or first and third even

00:05:48.659 --> 00:05:50.450 
first and second or first and third even
in<00:05:48.900> most<00:05:49.289> Pro<00:05:49.620> shows<00:05:49.830> but<00:05:50.010> when<00:05:50.099> it<00:05:50.190> comes<00:05:50.340> to

00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:50.460 
in most Pro shows but when it comes to

00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:51.649 
in most Pro shows but when it comes to
the<00:05:50.520> left<00:05:50.699> here<00:05:50.849> there<00:05:51.060> could<00:05:51.090> be<00:05:51.270> a<00:05:51.389> kibbeh

right<00:06:02.370> now<00:06:02.520> it<00:06:02.820> seems<00:06:03.000> to<00:06:03.150> me<00:06:03.270> the<00:06:03.360> Jay

00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:03.510 
right now it seems to me the Jay

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:05.930 
right now it seems to me the Jay
Cutler's<00:06:03.870> playing<00:06:04.050> catch-up<00:06:04.699> should<00:06:05.699> lose

00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:05.940 
Cutler's playing catch-up should lose

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:07.850

his<00:06:06.090> title<00:06:06.300> of<00:06:06.570> things<00:06:06.780> are<00:06:06.900> judged<00:06:07.110> fairly<00:06:07.349> so

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:07.860 
his title of things are judged fairly so

00:06:07.860 --> 00:06:09.770 
his title of things are judged fairly so
that<00:06:08.010> the<00:06:08.099> champion<00:06:08.520> is<00:06:08.669> less<00:06:09.300> standing<00:06:09.659> with

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:09.780 
that the champion is less standing with
