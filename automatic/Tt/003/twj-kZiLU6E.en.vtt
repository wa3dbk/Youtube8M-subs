00:03:21.890 --> 00:03:21.900 
underneath it so it doesn't get

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.440

bit<00:05:21.590> more<00:05:21.770> to<00:05:21.950> get<00:05:22.040> the<00:05:22.160> colors<00:05:22.460> running<00:05:22.760> down

00:05:22.930 --> 00:05:22.940 
bit more to get the colors running down

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:24.730 
bit more to get the colors running down
like<00:05:23.510> I<00:05:23.630> would<00:05:23.780> want<00:05:23.930> these<00:05:24.050> colors<00:05:24.320> to<00:05:24.590> run

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:24.740 
like I would want these colors to run

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:26.590 
like I would want these colors to run
down<00:05:24.890> a<00:05:24.919> little<00:05:25.100> bit<00:05:25.250> more<00:05:25.490> but<00:05:26.090> I<00:05:26.300> kind<00:05:26.540> of

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:26.600 
down a little bit more but I kind of

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:29.380 
down a little bit more but I kind of
like<00:05:26.810> the<00:05:27.310> nufs<00:05:28.310> of<00:05:28.520> it<00:05:28.640> I<00:05:28.760> don't<00:05:28.940> know<00:05:29.000> but<00:05:29.270> I

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:29.390 
like the nufs of it I don't know but I

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:31.270 
like the nufs of it I don't know but I
think<00:05:29.690> it's<00:05:29.900> cute<00:05:30.110> this<00:05:30.620> would<00:05:30.800> definitely<00:05:31.040> be

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:31.280 
think it's cute this would definitely be

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:33.250 
think it's cute this would definitely be
a<00:05:31.370> cute<00:05:31.610> Father's<00:05:31.850> Day<00:05:32.030> gift<00:05:32.270> if<00:05:32.510> my<00:05:32.990> father

00:05:33.250 --> 00:05:33.260 
a cute Father's Day gift if my father

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:35.800 
a cute Father's Day gift if my father
lived<00:05:33.560> in<00:05:33.650> the<00:05:33.740> same<00:05:33.890> state<00:05:34.160> as<00:05:34.310> I<00:05:34.460> did<00:05:34.700> I<00:05:34.910> would

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:35.810 
lived in the same state as I did I would

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:37.510 
lived in the same state as I did I would
probably<00:05:36.260> have<00:05:36.650> my<00:05:36.770> little<00:05:36.919> sister<00:05:37.220> give<00:05:37.400> this

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:37.520 
probably have my little sister give this

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:39.219 
probably have my little sister give this
to<00:05:37.700> him<00:05:37.820> a<00:05:37.880> smaller<00:05:38.120> state<00:05:38.390> gift<00:05:38.600> I<00:05:38.810> don't<00:05:38.930> know

00:05:39.219 --> 00:05:39.229 
to him a smaller state gift I don't know

00:05:39.229 --> 00:05:41.980 
to him a smaller state gift I don't know
if<00:05:39.760> my<00:05:40.760> dad<00:05:40.940> would<00:05:41.120> be<00:05:41.210> like<00:05:41.330> that<00:05:41.660> I<00:05:41.690> gave<00:05:41.870> me<00:05:41.960> a

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:41.990 
if my dad would be like that I gave me a

00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:43.360 
if my dad would be like that I gave me a
crayon<00:05:42.260> portrait<00:05:42.470> but<00:05:42.800> is<00:05:42.890> she<00:05:42.919> in<00:05:43.010> second

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:43.370 
crayon portrait but is she in second

00:05:43.370 --> 00:05:46.180 
crayon portrait but is she in second
grade<00:05:43.430> I<00:05:43.729> mean<00:05:43.910> I<00:05:44.150> don't<00:05:44.750> know<00:05:44.810> I'm<00:05:45.740> in<00:05:45.860> college

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:46.190 
grade I mean I don't know I'm in college

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:47.650 
grade I mean I don't know I'm in college
so<00:05:46.460> maybe<00:05:46.790> it's<00:05:46.970> expecting<00:05:47.360> a<00:05:47.419> little<00:05:47.510> more

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:47.660 
so maybe it's expecting a little more

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:49.659 
so maybe it's expecting a little more
but<00:05:47.990> usually<00:05:48.380> my<00:05:48.500> father<00:05:48.770> is<00:05:48.950> a<00:05:48.979> like<00:05:49.340> Father's

00:05:49.659 --> 00:05:49.669 
but usually my father is a like Father's

00:05:49.669 --> 00:05:51.700 
but usually my father is a like Father's
Day<00:05:49.820> present<00:05:49.900> so<00:05:50.900> this<00:05:51.260> would<00:05:51.410> be<00:05:51.500> a<00:05:51.530> good

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:51.710 
Day present so this would be a good

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:52.990 
Day present so this would be a good
thing<00:05:51.890> that<00:05:51.919> you<00:05:52.100> didn't<00:05:52.400> really<00:05:52.640> spend<00:05:52.820> a<00:05:52.880> lot

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:53.000 
thing that you didn't really spend a lot

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.640 
thing that you didn't really spend a lot
of<00:05:53.030> money<00:05:53.150> on<00:05:53.390> and<00:05:53.690> it<00:05:53.840> came<00:05:54.110> from<00:05:54.320> the<00:05:54.470> heart

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:54.650 
of money on and it came from the heart

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:57.820 
of money on and it came from the heart
um<00:05:55.090> but<00:05:56.090> I<00:05:56.450> think<00:05:56.600> that<00:05:56.930> is<00:05:57.110> it<00:05:57.320> this<00:05:57.500> is<00:05:57.710> the

00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:57.830 
um but I think that is it this is the

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:00.040 
um but I think that is it this is the
end<00:05:57.860> the<00:05:58.370> finished<00:05:58.640> product<00:05:59.030> it<00:05:59.360> turned<00:05:59.900> out

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:00.050 
end the finished product it turned out

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:02.860 
end the finished product it turned out
really<00:06:00.320> well<00:06:00.800> for<00:06:01.130> how<00:06:01.880> inexpensive<00:06:02.390> it<00:06:02.690> was

00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:02.870 
really well for how inexpensive it was

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:05.050 
really well for how inexpensive it was
and<00:06:03.320> I<00:06:03.770> hope<00:06:03.979> you<00:06:04.100> guys<00:06:04.220> try<00:06:04.430> this<00:06:04.550> out<00:06:04.820> and<00:06:04.940> if

how<00:06:15.310> it's<00:06:15.520> gonna<00:06:15.610> look

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:15.940 
how it's gonna look

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:18.240 
how it's gonna look
um<00:06:16.380> because<00:06:17.380> I<00:06:17.590> really<00:06:17.800> want<00:06:17.950> to<00:06:18.010> know<00:06:18.070> how

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:18.250 
um because I really want to know how

00:06:18.250 --> 00:06:19.890 
um because I really want to know how
it's<00:06:18.430> going<00:06:18.550> to<00:06:18.640> look<00:06:18.850> with<00:06:19.420> the<00:06:19.570> neutral

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:19.900 
it's going to look with the neutral

00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:21.690 
it's going to look with the neutral
colors<00:06:20.260> I<00:06:20.560> think<00:06:21.070> that<00:06:21.340> it<00:06:21.430> would<00:06:21.520> look<00:06:21.640> really

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:23.370 
colors I think that it would look really
cool<00:06:22.090> so<00:06:22.390> maybe<00:06:22.600> I'll<00:06:22.720> get<00:06:22.810> like<00:06:22.930> a<00:06:22.960> smaller

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:23.380 
cool so maybe I'll get like a smaller

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:25.050 
cool so maybe I'll get like a smaller
board<00:06:23.770> like<00:06:23.950> one<00:06:24.130> like<00:06:24.280> about<00:06:24.490> half<00:06:24.640> this<00:06:24.850> size

00:06:25.050 --> 00:06:25.060
