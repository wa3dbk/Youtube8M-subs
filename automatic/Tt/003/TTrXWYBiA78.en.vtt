00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
so the first thing I'm going to do is

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.839 
so the first thing I'm going to do is
braid<00:02:16.230> my<00:02:16.410> hair<00:02:16.440> into<00:02:17.280> four<00:02:17.550> different

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
sections two on each side and the reason

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:23.420 
sections two on each side and the reason
you<00:02:20.610> do<00:02:20.730> this<00:02:20.760> is<00:02:21.120> so<00:02:21.750> that<00:02:22.140> the<00:02:22.440> first<00:02:23.099> color

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:23.430 
you do this is so that the first color

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:28.640 
you do this is so that the first color
doesn't<00:02:23.910> look<00:02:24.890> like<00:02:26.209> watched<00:02:27.209> on<00:02:27.510> it<00:02:27.959> makes<00:02:28.560> it

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:28.650 
doesn't look like watched on it makes it

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.360 
doesn't look like watched on it makes it
look<00:02:28.800> much<00:02:29.040> more<00:02:29.340> faded<00:02:30.180> into<00:02:31.190> your<00:02:32.190> natural

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:33.630 
of color that you use so that you don't

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:36.800 
of color that you use so that you don't
contaminate<00:03:34.049> the<00:03:34.440> other<00:03:34.560> area<00:03:34.980> I<00:03:35.600> was<00:03:36.600> just

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
contaminate the other area I was just

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:38.090 
contaminate the other area I was just
looking<00:03:37.019> over<00:03:37.200> this<00:03:37.290> video<00:03:37.440> again<00:03:37.739> and<00:03:37.799> I'm

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:38.100 
looking over this video again and I'm

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:39.560 
looking over this video again and I'm
not<00:03:38.280> really<00:03:38.400> sure<00:03:38.519> why<00:03:38.760> I<00:03:38.790> look<00:03:38.970> so<00:03:39.120> worried<00:03:39.450> in

not really sure why I look so worried in

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:41.000 
not really sure why I look so worried in
it<00:03:39.690> I<00:03:39.810> guess<00:03:39.959> that's<00:03:40.170> just<00:03:40.200> my<00:03:40.380> concentrating

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.010 
it I guess that's just my concentrating

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:44.569 
it I guess that's just my concentrating
face<00:03:42.380> so<00:03:43.380> now<00:03:43.560> that<00:03:43.620> you<00:03:44.130> have<00:03:44.310> your<00:03:44.430> hair

the way to the rubber band and to apply
it<00:03:56.370> sort<00:03:56.850> of<00:03:56.940> unevenly<00:03:57.660> on<00:03:58.079> when<00:03:58.680> you<00:03:58.769> come<00:03:58.920> to

00:03:59.000 --> 00:03:59.010 
it sort of unevenly on when you come to

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.490 
it sort of unevenly on when you come to
the<00:03:59.130> top<00:03:59.340> so<00:04:00.030> that<00:04:00.060> it<00:04:00.269> blends<00:04:00.600> better<00:04:01.109> and

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
the top so that it blends better and

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:07.220 
the top so that it blends better and
doesn't<00:04:02.340> look<00:04:03.060> so<00:04:03.540> just<00:04:05.150> died<00:04:06.150> yeah<00:04:06.600> I<00:04:06.870> mean

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230

you<00:04:08.040> know

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.720 

and<00:04:15.270> now<00:04:15.750> after<00:04:16.290> you<00:04:16.590> have<00:04:16.920> it<00:04:17.160> applied<00:04:17.430> to<00:04:17.459> the

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:17.730 
and now after you have it applied to the

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:19.370 
and now after you have it applied to the
tips<00:04:17.970> you<00:04:18.570> want<00:04:18.720> to<00:04:18.780> take<00:04:18.930> the<00:04:19.019> rubber<00:04:19.139> bands

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:55.720 
experience of a tiny little piece of dye

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:58.140 
experience of a tiny little piece of dye
falling<00:05:56.530> on<00:05:56.680> to<00:05:56.980> your<00:05:57.310> rug<00:05:57.460> or<00:05:57.760> something<00:05:57.910> like

00:05:58.140 --> 00:05:58.150 
falling on to your rug or something like

00:05:58.150 --> 00:05:59.970 
falling on to your rug or something like
that<00:05:58.300> and<00:05:58.540> then<00:05:58.900> trying<00:05:59.200> to<00:05:59.290> wipe<00:05:59.500> it<00:05:59.650> up<00:05:59.770> and

00:05:59.970 --> 00:05:59.980 
that and then trying to wipe it up and

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:04.680 
that and then trying to wipe it up and
it<00:06:00.130> goes<00:06:00.310> like<00:06:00.760> a<00:06:01.230> square<00:06:02.230> mile<00:06:03.330> but<00:06:04.330> imagine

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:04.690 
it goes like a square mile but imagine

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:06.210 
it goes like a square mile but imagine
what<00:06:04.720> that<00:06:04.930> can<00:06:05.050> do<00:06:05.170> to<00:06:05.200> your<00:06:05.350> hair<00:06:05.530> so<00:06:05.770> if<00:06:06.100> you

00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:06.220 
what that can do to your hair so if you

00:06:06.220 --> 00:06:08.490 
what that can do to your hair so if you
even<00:06:06.400> have<00:06:06.610> a<00:06:06.640> tiny<00:06:06.880> little<00:06:07.030> piece<00:06:07.390> of<00:06:07.630> dye

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:08.500 
even have a tiny little piece of dye

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:10.950 
even have a tiny little piece of dye
left<00:06:09.370> on<00:06:09.610> your<00:06:09.760> gloves<00:06:10.030> they<00:06:10.210> didn't<00:06:10.450> see<00:06:10.660> and

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:10.960 
left on your gloves they didn't see and

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:13.050 
left on your gloves they didn't see and
then<00:06:11.200> you<00:06:11.230> put<00:06:11.680> it<00:06:11.800> in<00:06:11.980> the<00:06:12.400> other<00:06:12.550> color<00:06:12.850> it

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:13.060 
then you put it in the other color it

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:15.540 
then you put it in the other color it
could<00:06:13.300> totally<00:06:13.630> mess<00:06:14.560> up<00:06:14.770> the<00:06:14.920> whole<00:06:15.040> dye<00:06:15.250> job

00:06:15.540 --> 00:06:15.550 
could totally mess up the whole dye job

00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:18.900 
could totally mess up the whole dye job
so<00:06:16.120> I<00:06:16.150> think<00:06:16.390> it's<00:06:16.570> easier<00:06:16.870> just<00:06:16.930> to<00:06:17.200> use<00:06:17.910> you

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:18.910 
so I think it's easier just to use you

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:20.940 
so I think it's easier just to use you
know<00:06:19.030> ten<00:06:19.300> a<00:06:19.510> ten-cent<00:06:20.170> pair<00:06:20.320> of<00:06:20.440> gloves<00:06:20.590> for
