coming<00:00:11.969> to<00:00:12.120> a<00:00:12.150> scheme<00:00:12.630> that<00:00:12.660> seems<00:00:13.080> like<00:00:13.230> it's

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:13.380 
coming to a scheme that seems like it's

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.740 
coming to a scheme that seems like it's
a<00:00:13.440> little<00:00:13.500> more<00:00:13.710> simplified<00:00:14.599> simplified<00:00:15.599> in

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:15.750 
a little more simplified simplified in

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.490 
a little more simplified simplified in
the<00:00:15.839> way<00:00:15.990> yeah<00:00:16.350> but<00:00:16.740> it's<00:00:16.980> also<00:00:17.300> it's<00:00:18.300> very<00:00:18.690> I

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:19.500 
the way yeah but it's also it's very I

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.040 
the way yeah but it's also it's very I
mean<00:00:20.250> they're<00:00:20.820> very<00:00:21.090> particular<00:00:21.539> as<00:00:21.660> to<00:00:21.689> where

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:22.050 
mean they're very particular as to where
