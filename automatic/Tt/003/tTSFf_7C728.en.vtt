00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.929
 hello this tutorial is going to talk to you about 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.929
 the food chains 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:12.480
 energy flow this process of 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.150
 One-level energy circulation 

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:17.850
 trophic to another through the chain 

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:20.970
 food is unidirectional 

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.920
 that is to say it occurs in only one direction and 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.169
 we can and we can have the energy of 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.730
 food chain in terrestrial media 

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:30.930
 air and water 

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:30.930
 food chain 

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:38.840
 the current of energy and nutrients that 

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:42.920
 establishes between different species of a 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:45.559
 ecosystem in relation to its nutrition 

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:48.409
 the energy is light and that is very useful 

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:50.510
 for photos photos synthesizers or 

00:00:48.409 --> 00:00:52.339
 the producers these in turn are 

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.559
 useful for consumers whether they are 

00:00:52.339 --> 00:00:57.409
 these tertiary secondary primary or 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:58.460
 4 ciaries and these in turn are useful 

00:00:57.409 --> 00:01:00.589
 for the two 

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:05.170
 decomposers that transform the 

00:01:00.589 --> 00:01:05.170
 matter in inorganic matter 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:11.210
 the producers 

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:13.190
 are the autotrophic organisms the 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:15.890
 producers get their energy from the sun 

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:18.050
 mainly and these can be the 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.810
 green plants algae and bacteria 

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:22.880
 photosynthetic that build their stuff 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:25.390
 organic for you from substances 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:28.300
 simple inorganic 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:31.360
 as we can see here are the algae 

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:34.110
 are the bacteria and healthy that are the 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.110
 green plants 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:40.319
 consumers consumers are 

00:01:38.249 --> 00:01:42.630
 hetero organisms others that feed 

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:44.819
 from others to those who use as a source 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:46.649
 of energy and matter 

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:49.950
 these can be secondary primary 

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:51.600
 tertiary or 4 ciaries here we have 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.630
 some examples about consumers 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.189
 primary are small animals that are 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.069
 more herbivores 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:02:02.090
 they follow these here then these and 

00:01:59.069 --> 00:02:05.570
 then the 400 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:07.789
 the decomposers these are ether other 

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:09.729
 that they feed on remains of both 

00:02:07.789 --> 00:02:12.390
 producers as consumers 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:15.840
 transforming the remains 

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:18.209
 again in elemental molecules 

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.970
 they are very important because they return 

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:24.890
 medium chemicals that can be 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:24.890
 used again by the producers 

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.500
 food chains 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:36.110
 terrestrial here we see an example 

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:38.240
 first of all is what is the grass 

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.970
 It can be green plants such as them 

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:44.630
 I said or a microorganism then it follows 

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:47.150
 a rabbit this is devoured by a wolf and 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:49.750
 that in turn the wolf devours him as a lion or 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:52.600
 You can also be here 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:55.200
 a primary animal such as can be a 

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.200
 zebra 

00:02:55.630 --> 00:03:01.900
 the lion in turn is devoured by a 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:05.500
 snake and this in turn is the hawk it 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:07.330
 devours it and then the hawk it 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:12.670
 transforms 

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:15.450
 in inorganic matter it happens again to 

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:15.450
 be this 

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:20.970
 to 0 and then you're going to make a subject 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:20.970
 organic 

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:31.530
 aerial food chain that chain 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:33.360
 food is made up of birds as 

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:36.390
 1st 

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:39.140
 point we have a plant like it can be 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:39.140
 a cherry 

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:46.450
 and the cherry is eaten by the pigeon 

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:48.970
 pigeon is devoured by an owl the eagle 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:51.730
 devours the owl and this in turn is 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:57.000
 devoured by the condor which is then passed 

00:03:51.730 --> 00:03:57.000
 to be a broken organism 

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:06.150
 the aquatic food chain as 

00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:07.760
 we see here in this drawing is 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:11.570
 conformed by what they are 

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:14.730
 microorganisms and algae these can be 

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:18.690
 eaten so it is a small fish 

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:21.390
 or a shrimp the shrimp eats it a 

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:22.560
 carp is in turn the weevil is what 

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:26.280
 eat 

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:28.950
 the penguin eats outdated then the 

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:33.320
 seal is eaten the penguin and finally the 

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:33.320
 whale or shark the seal is eaten 

00:04:36.129 --> 00:04:42.929
 Here we see some examples of what 

00:04:38.199 --> 00:04:42.929
 they are terrestrial food chains 

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:47.650
 aerial food chain 

00:04:47.689 --> 00:04:51.610
 and aquatic food chain
