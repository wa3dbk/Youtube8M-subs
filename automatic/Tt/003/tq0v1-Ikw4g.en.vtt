as well : so I'm sure you'll probably

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:06.530 
as well : so I'm sure you'll probably
have<00:00:04.859> even<00:00:05.009> more<00:00:05.310> ideas<00:00:05.790> for<00:00:05.970> moves<00:00:06.180> that<00:00:06.359> you

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:06.540 
have even more ideas for moves that you

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.070 
have even more ideas for moves that you
play<00:00:06.779> Paper<00:00:07.470> Mario<00:00:07.740> ok<00:00:08.700> Mario<00:00:09.480> I<00:00:09.630> think<00:00:09.929> it's

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.080 
play Paper Mario ok Mario I think it's

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.020 
play Paper Mario ok Mario I think it's
just<00:00:10.200> perfect<00:00:10.740> for<00:00:10.830> Smash<00:00:11.519> Bros<00:00:11.820> you<00:00:11.940> know

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
just perfect for Smash Bros you know

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.190 
just perfect for Smash Bros you know
it's<00:00:12.179> sort<00:00:12.240> of<00:00:12.330> a<00:00:12.450> sub-brand

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:13.200 
it's sort of a sub-brand

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.749 
it's sort of a sub-brand
been<00:00:13.469> around<00:00:13.620> for<00:00:13.769> a<00:00:13.830> long<00:00:13.980> time<00:00:14.040> it's<00:00:14.490> got<00:00:14.639> its

00:00:14.749 --> 00:00:14.759 
been around for a long time it's got its

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:17.599 
been around for a long time it's got its
own<00:00:14.849> hardcore<00:00:15.660> following<00:00:16.170> so<00:00:16.410> I<00:00:16.440> I<00:00:16.859> honestly

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:17.609 
own hardcore following so I I honestly

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:18.830 
own hardcore following so I I honestly
don't<00:00:17.850> see<00:00:17.880> at<00:00:18.060> this<00:00:18.150> point<00:00:18.420> why<00:00:18.510> they<00:00:18.660> haven't

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:18.840 
don't see at this point why they haven't

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.480 
don't see at this point why they haven't
included<00:00:19.140> Paper<00:00:19.500> Mario<00:00:19.710> yeah<00:00:20.189> there's<00:00:20.369> plenty

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:20.490 
included Paper Mario yeah there's plenty

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:22.609 
included Paper Mario yeah there's plenty
of<00:00:20.670> moves<00:00:20.910> there's<00:00:21.779> plenty<00:00:22.080> of<00:00:22.109> ways<00:00:22.289> you<00:00:22.500> can

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:22.619 
of moves there's plenty of ways you can

00:00:22.619 --> 00:00:24.140 
of moves there's plenty of ways you can
differentiate<00:00:23.010> them<00:00:23.340> from<00:00:23.369> just<00:00:23.730> regular

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:24.150 
differentiate them from just regular

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.170 
differentiate them from just regular
Mario<00:00:24.390> but<00:00:24.869> yeah<00:00:25.320> obviously<00:00:25.650> I<00:00:26.070> think<00:00:26.189> just

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:27.180 
Mario but yeah obviously I think just

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.450 
Mario but yeah obviously I think just
regular<00:00:27.510> be<00:00:27.660> move<00:00:27.930> would<00:00:28.260> be<00:00:28.289> your<00:00:28.619> hammer<00:00:28.890> you

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
regular be move would be your hammer you

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:30.950 
regular be move would be your hammer you
know<00:00:29.580> I<00:00:29.609> think<00:00:29.699> it's<00:00:29.939> again<00:00:30.420> it's<00:00:30.720> odd<00:00:30.929> that

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
know I think it's again it's odd that

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.749 
know I think it's again it's odd that
you<00:00:31.230> know<00:00:31.439> it<00:00:31.590> just<00:00:31.769> seemed<00:00:31.949> so<00:00:31.980> obvious<00:00:32.579> to

00:00:32.749 --> 00:00:32.759 
you know it just seemed so obvious to

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:34.069 
you know it just seemed so obvious to
you<00:00:32.880> know<00:00:32.969> just<00:00:33.149> have<00:00:33.210> Mario<00:00:33.600> gender<00:00:33.960> and

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
you know just have Mario gender and

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.330 
you know just have Mario gender and
Paper<00:00:34.230> Mario<00:00:34.410> jump<00:00:34.739> around<00:00:34.860> with<00:00:35.070> a<00:00:35.130> hammer

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
Paper Mario jump around with a hammer

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.860 
Paper Mario jump around with a hammer
and<00:00:35.520> then<00:00:35.730> you've<00:00:35.850> got<00:00:36.090> all<00:00:36.180> those<00:00:36.329> paper

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
and then you've got all those paper

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.319 
and then you've got all those paper
bunnies<00:00:37.320> I'm<00:00:38.160> trying<00:00:38.489> to<00:00:38.550> think<00:00:38.640> of<00:00:38.760> specific

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329 
bunnies I'm trying to think of specific

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:42.319 
bunnies I'm trying to think of specific
ones<00:00:39.540> that<00:00:39.719> would<00:00:40.129> work<00:00:41.129> best<00:00:41.399> well<00:00:41.940> so<00:00:42.090> here's

00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:42.329 
ones that would work best well so here's

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:44.360 
ones that would work best well so here's
here's<00:00:42.690> I<00:00:43.050> actually<00:00:43.590> thought<00:00:43.980> a<00:00:44.040> lot<00:00:44.309> about

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:44.370 
here's I actually thought a lot about

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.459 
here's I actually thought a lot about
paper<00:00:45.239> Mario's<00:00:45.600> move<00:00:45.750> said<00:00:45.960> new<00:00:46.110> you'd<00:00:46.260> help

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
paper Mario's move said new you'd help

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:48.500 
paper Mario's move said new you'd help
me<00:00:46.500> out<00:00:46.649> here<00:00:46.860> yeah<00:00:47.100> yeah<00:00:47.910> no<00:00:48.030> he<00:00:48.180> was<00:00:48.300> on<00:00:48.420> my

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
me out here yeah yeah no he was on my

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.209 
me out here yeah yeah no he was on my
list<00:00:48.690> this<00:00:49.140> is<00:00:49.289> actually<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.680> other<00:00:49.829> in-depth

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
list this is actually the other in-depth

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:53.150 
list this is actually the other in-depth
character<00:00:50.579> that<00:00:50.670> I<00:00:50.760> had<00:00:51.379> he<00:00:52.379> has<00:00:52.860> a<00:00:52.890> lot<00:00:53.129> of

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:53.160 
character that I had he has a lot of

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:55.160 
character that I had he has a lot of
abilities<00:00:53.640> that<00:00:53.850> Mario<00:00:54.390> either<00:00:54.629> doesn't<00:00:54.899> have

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
abilities that Mario either doesn't have

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.319 
abilities that Mario either doesn't have
or<00:00:55.440> just<00:00:55.469> doesn't<00:00:55.770> simply<00:00:56.190> use<00:00:56.430> in<00:00:56.610> Smash

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
or just doesn't simply use in Smash

00:00:57.329 --> 00:00:59.090 
or just doesn't simply use in Smash
for<00:00:57.719> example<00:00:58.079> the<00:00:58.199> beatdown<00:00:58.559> could<00:00:58.800> be<00:00:58.890> paper

00:00:59.090 --> 00:00:59.100 
for example the beatdown could be paper

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.250 
for example the beatdown could be paper
Mario's<00:00:59.460> ground<00:00:59.730> pound<00:00:59.969> I<00:01:00.510> was<00:01:01.079> actually

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
Mario's ground pound I was actually

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.200 
Mario's ground pound I was actually
thinking<00:01:01.440> that<00:01:01.980> the<00:01:02.309> hammer<00:01:02.550> could<00:01:02.850> be<00:01:02.969> his

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.210 
thinking that the hammer could be his

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.140 
thinking that the hammer could be his
his<00:01:03.570> a<00:01:03.870> attack<00:01:04.260> and<00:01:04.500> a<00:01:05.010> charged<00:01:05.430> hammer<00:01:05.760> like

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.150 
his a attack and a charged hammer like

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.490 
his a attack and a charged hammer like
the<00:01:06.299> earthquake<00:01:06.930> or<00:01:07.110> whatever<00:01:07.320> it's<00:01:07.470> called

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:07.500 
the earthquake or whatever it's called

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.679 
the earthquake or whatever it's called
could<00:01:08.250> be<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.460> B<00:01:08.610> attack<00:01:08.880> or<00:01:09.270> it<00:01:09.450> could<00:01:09.600> be

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
could be the B attack or it could be

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.450 
could be the B attack or it could be
smash<00:01:09.930> attack<00:01:10.229> that<00:01:10.860> would<00:01:10.950> just<00:01:11.130> give<00:01:11.250> him<00:01:11.369> a

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
smash attack that would just give him a

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:12.920 
smash attack that would just give him a
little<00:01:11.580> bit<00:01:11.729> more<00:01:11.880> moveset<00:01:12.270> variety<00:01:12.630> it<00:01:12.810> would

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
little bit more moveset variety it would

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.690 
little bit more moveset variety it would
draw<00:01:13.110> from<00:01:13.140> a<00:01:13.380> greater<00:01:13.890> variety<00:01:14.130> of<00:01:14.430> source

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700 
draw from a greater variety of source

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.179 
draw from a greater variety of source
material<00:01:14.760> as<00:01:15.299> well<00:01:15.509> for<00:01:16.140> for<00:01:16.590> a<00:01:16.619> Down<00:01:16.860> B<00:01:17.159> I

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189 
material as well for for a Down B I

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:19.399 
material as well for for a Down B I
think<00:01:17.610> having<00:01:17.759> uh<00:01:17.880> just<00:01:18.360> like<00:01:18.450> a<00:01:18.509> ground<00:01:19.110> pound

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:19.409 
think having uh just like a ground pound

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:21.020 
think having uh just like a ground pound
would<00:01:19.560> be<00:01:19.650> great<00:01:19.860> almost<00:01:20.189> like<00:01:20.310> a<00:01:20.340> you<00:01:20.939> know

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
would be great almost like a you know

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.460 
would be great almost like a you know
move<00:01:21.240> that<00:01:21.390> you<00:01:21.450> could<00:01:21.570> yeah<00:01:21.689> smash<00:01:22.080> people

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
move that you could yeah smash people

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.890 
move that you could yeah smash people
off<00:01:22.619> edges<00:01:22.860> with<00:01:23.220> like<00:01:23.610> Kirby's<00:01:24.030> uh<00:01:24.060> like

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
off edges with like Kirby's uh like

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.840 
off edges with like Kirby's uh like
Kirby's<00:01:25.290> down<00:01:25.470> B<00:01:25.680> essentially<00:01:26.100> but<00:01:26.460> without

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
Kirby's down B essentially but without

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.030 
Kirby's down B essentially but without
the<00:01:27.060> added<00:01:27.600> defense<00:01:28.020> but<00:01:28.200> I<00:01:28.229> imagined<00:01:28.860> more

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
the added defense but I imagined more

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.859 
the added defense but I imagined more
like<00:01:29.189> Yoshi's<00:01:29.640> a<00:01:29.939> little<00:01:30.240> bit<00:01:30.360> lighter<00:01:30.570> a

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:38.220 
suggest having paper Mario's partners to

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.039 
suggest having paper Mario's partners to
attack<00:01:38.490> but<00:01:38.759> I<00:01:38.880> don't<00:01:39.270> really<00:01:39.420> like<00:01:39.600> the<00:01:39.780> idea

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
attack but I don't really like the idea

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.020 
attack but I don't really like the idea
of<00:01:40.110> having<00:01:40.380> a<00:01:40.650> character<00:01:41.100> in<00:01:41.340> the<00:01:41.490> game<00:01:41.520> who

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
of having a character in the game who

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.030 
of having a character in the game who
relies<00:01:42.810> on<00:01:42.840> a<00:01:43.200> bunch<00:01:43.530> of<00:01:43.649> other<00:01:43.799> characters

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
relies on a bunch of other characters

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.580 
relies on a bunch of other characters
appearing<00:01:44.700> out<00:01:44.790> of<00:01:44.820> nowhere<00:01:44.909> I<00:01:45.420> would<00:01:46.259> be<00:01:46.380> fine

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
appearing out of nowhere I would be fine

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.380 
appearing out of nowhere I would be fine
if<00:01:46.770> he<00:01:47.040> had<00:01:47.220> maybe<00:01:47.430> an<00:01:47.610> attack<00:01:47.880> where<00:01:48.090> he<00:01:48.210> like

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:48.390 
if he had maybe an attack where he like

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.210 
if he had maybe an attack where he like
jumps<00:01:48.689> on<00:01:48.810> a<00:01:48.840> Koopa<00:01:49.200> shell<00:01:49.409> that's<00:01:49.799> colored

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
jumps on a Koopa shell that's colored

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.190 
jumps on a Koopa shell that's colored
like<00:01:50.430> coupes<00:01:50.729> or<00:01:51.030> or<00:01:51.570> something<00:01:51.780> like<00:01:51.990> that

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
like coupes or or something like that

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.050 
like coupes or or something like that
but<00:01:52.740> I<00:01:52.979> wouldn't<00:01:53.220> like<00:01:53.430> a<00:01:53.460> move<00:01:53.729> set<00:01:53.939> that's

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
but I wouldn't like a move set that's

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.090 
but I wouldn't like a move set that's
based<00:01:54.360> all<00:01:54.600> around<00:01:54.930> using<00:01:55.170> stickers<00:01:55.649> and

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
based all around using stickers and

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.429 
based all around using stickers and
pixels<00:01:56.700> and<00:01:57.000> partners<00:01:57.390> and<00:01:57.659> stuff<00:01:57.840> I<00:01:58.140> think

00:01:58.429 --> 00:01:58.439 
pixels and partners and stuff I think

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.709 
pixels and partners and stuff I think
maybe<00:01:58.640> possibly<00:01:59.640> for<00:01:59.880> a<00:01:59.909> final<00:02:00.149> smash<00:02:00.509> it

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
maybe possibly for a final smash it

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:01.969 
maybe possibly for a final smash it
could<00:02:00.810> be<00:02:00.869> cool<00:02:00.990> to<00:02:01.200> have<00:02:01.229> just<00:02:01.530> like<00:02:01.649> all<00:02:01.829> the

00:02:01.969 --> 00:02:01.979 
could be cool to have just like all the

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:03.440 
could be cool to have just like all the
partners<00:02:02.310> from<00:02:02.460> the<00:02:02.549> first<00:02:02.759> game<00:02:02.969> each<00:02:03.210> like

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
partners from the first game each like

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.090 
partners from the first game each like
swoop<00:02:03.750> in<00:02:03.960> and<00:02:04.140> do<00:02:04.229> their<00:02:04.350> thing<00:02:04.409> really<00:02:04.860> quick

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:05.100 
swoop in and do their thing really quick

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.340 
swoop in and do their thing really quick
so<00:02:05.340> it's<00:02:05.549> just<00:02:05.729> kind<00:02:05.880> of<00:02:05.939> chaos<00:02:06.750> all<00:02:06.990> over<00:02:07.229> the

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:07.350 
so it's just kind of chaos all over the

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:09.169 
so it's just kind of chaos all over the
screen<00:02:07.649> what<00:02:08.190> I<00:02:08.220> was<00:02:08.459> thinking<00:02:08.819> for<00:02:08.910> a<00:02:09.000> final

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:09.179 
screen what I was thinking for a final

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:09.940

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950

update<00:03:05.030> recovery<00:03:05.450> yes<00:03:06.079> yes<00:03:06.560> we<00:03:06.739> are<00:03:07.030> but<00:03:08.030> you

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
update recovery yes yes we are but you

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:09.610 
update recovery yes yes we are but you
know<00:03:08.329> and<00:03:08.510> there<00:03:08.720> are<00:03:08.750> so<00:03:09.170> many<00:03:09.380> little

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
know and there are so many little

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:12.190 
know and there are so many little
details<00:03:10.130> I<00:03:10.310> think<00:03:10.489> with<00:03:10.610> Paper<00:03:10.790> Mario<00:03:10.970> 2<00:03:11.390> that

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:12.200 
details I think with Paper Mario 2 that

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.080 
details I think with Paper Mario 2 that
would<00:03:12.319> make<00:03:12.470> really<00:03:12.709> great<00:03:12.950> smash<00:03:13.459> stuff<00:03:13.790> like

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:14.090 
would make really great smash stuff like

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:16.059 
would make really great smash stuff like
that<00:03:14.420> animation<00:03:14.959> where<00:03:15.109> he<00:03:15.170> tucks<00:03:15.470> his<00:03:15.560> hat<00:03:15.859> in

00:03:16.059 --> 00:03:16.069 
that animation where he tucks his hat in

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:18.370 
that animation where he tucks his hat in
or<00:03:16.340> we<00:03:16.430> tucks<00:03:16.819> his<00:03:16.970> head<00:03:17.150> under<00:03:17.420> his<00:03:17.510> hat<00:03:17.720> ducks

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:18.380 
or we tucks his head under his hat ducks

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:20.800 
or we tucks his head under his hat ducks
down<00:03:18.650> to<00:03:19.040> defend<00:03:19.400> as<00:03:19.880> an<00:03:20.120> action<00:03:20.450> command

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:20.810 
down to defend as an action command

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:22.449 
down to defend as an action command
during<00:03:20.989> the<00:03:21.139> battle<00:03:21.410> sequences<00:03:21.829> that<00:03:22.280> could

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:22.459 
during the battle sequences that could

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:24.640 
during the battle sequences that could
be<00:03:22.549> his<00:03:22.730> shielding<00:03:23.150> animation<00:03:23.690> there's<00:03:24.440> just

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:24.650 
be his shielding animation there's just

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:27.190 
be his shielding animation there's just
so<00:03:24.889> many<00:03:25.069> little<00:03:25.190> things<00:03:25.579> that<00:03:25.970> I<00:03:26.150> think<00:03:26.209> they

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:27.200 
so many little things that I think they

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.470 
so many little things that I think they
have<00:03:27.380> a<00:03:27.410> lot<00:03:27.650> of<00:03:27.680> potential<00:03:28.040> to<00:03:28.340> to<00:03:28.760> just<00:03:29.209> bring

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:29.480 
have a lot of potential to to just bring

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.780 
have a lot of potential to to just bring
from<00:03:29.840> Paper<00:03:30.079> Mario<00:03:30.290> into<00:03:30.829> smash<00:03:31.100> and<00:03:31.400> make<00:03:31.639> him

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:31.790 
from Paper Mario into smash and make him

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:33.910 
from Paper Mario into smash and make him
really<00:03:32.660> feel<00:03:32.930> like<00:03:32.959> you're<00:03:33.290> just<00:03:33.440> directly

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:33.920 
really feel like you're just directly

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.009 
really feel like you're just directly
porting<00:03:34.459> Paper<00:03:34.670> Mario<00:03:34.940> the<00:03:35.359> character<00:03:35.750> into

00:03:36.009 --> 00:03:36.019 
porting Paper Mario the character into

00:03:36.019 --> 00:03:38.140 
porting Paper Mario the character into
the<00:03:36.049> smash<00:03:36.350> setting<00:03:36.709> and<00:03:36.859> working<00:03:37.639> just

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
the smash setting and working just

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.330 
the smash setting and working just
exactly<00:03:38.870> as<00:03:39.230> you<00:03:39.350> would<00:03:39.440> expect<00:03:39.769> them<00:03:39.920> to<00:03:39.950> and

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:40.340
