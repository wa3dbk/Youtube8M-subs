 improve television content these 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:37.100
 have worsened even the 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:39.110
 soap operas have improved audiences 

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:41.510
 they miss those melodramas of verónica 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:44.330
 Castro and now prefer soap operas 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.010
 Brazilian Colombian or something with 

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:48.650
 a minimum of coherence and better quality 

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:50.510
 in his production if azcárraga milmo 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:52.280
 He confessed that his television is for 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.140
 fucked salinas priego has given 

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.960
 enough samples to carry this 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:59.120
 axiom to its maximum expression television 

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:01.580
 Aztec uses and abuses ignorance 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.140
 prevailing in viewers has 

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:05.870
 Made of stridency and bad taste 

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:07.730
 a large market is the showcase for 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:09.890
 hook the most fucked in their 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:11.600
 Elektra stores in your Aztec bank in 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:14.780
 their bad replicas of the products of 

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:16.430
 televise first lesson the competition 

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:18.170
 in open television is not a guarantee of 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:20.569
 improve content 

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:22.489
 on the contrary if the model prevails 

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:24.319
 of a hypermarket television 

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:26.450
 oriented only to the entertainment of 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:28.940
 Low quality low cost and high gain 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:31.550
 the mirage of the rating is just one 

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:33.830
 justification for vulgarity one and 

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:35.840
 again ricardo salinas pliego and emilio 

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:37.459
 azcárraga jéan justify the terrible 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.989
 quality of Mexican television 

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:41.720
 arguing that that's what people 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:44.569
 wants to see if they do not agree 

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:46.100
 change channels have affirmed with this 

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:47.930
 the contempt confirm the most 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:51.230
 elementary rights of the hearings 

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:53.540
 that is to worthy contents diverse of 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:55.430
 entertainment information and advertising 

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:57.739
 Do not cheat in order to keep 

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:59.510
 to the viewers to the actors and the 

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:02.390
 producers at the expense of the merchants 

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:04.190
 of the spectrum second lesson the 

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:06.500
 dictatorship of the rating can not be the 

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:09.140
 only criterion for measuring success or 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:11.060
 future of an industry much less in 

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:13.940
 the enah of digital changes and the 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:15.680
 convergence have passed 20 years of that 

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:17.510
 discourse of azcárraga milmo and the 

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:19.519
 legislators revisit a 

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:22.700
 very ambitious reform in broadcasting and 

00:04:19.519 --> 00:04:24.530
 telecommunications 80% of the 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:24.860
 initiative presented by the pact for 

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:26.719
 medium 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:29.030
 is dedicated to regulate a market of 

00:04:26.719 --> 00:04:32.120
 telecommunications dominated by telmex 

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:34.550
 telcel and 20% to regulate the market for 

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:37.099
 television and radio dominated by television 

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:39.379
 TV Azteca and criteria 

00:04:37.099 --> 00:04:41.990
 to improve the content there is very little 

00:04:39.379 --> 00:04:43.550
 or almost nothing the obligation of 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:45.560
 that the state will guarantee the right to 

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:48.110
 the hearings in article 6 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:50.300
 constitutional prohibition is included 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:52.219
 to integrated advertising but no 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:54.710
 criterion to qualify the excessive 

00:04:52.219 --> 00:04:56.210
 marketing on the screen is 

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:57.949
 It is evident that at present 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:59.779
 respects the rule that only 20 per 

00:04:57.949 --> 00:05:02.779
 hundred of the contents should be 

00:04:59.779 --> 00:05:05.000
 the reality is reverse advertising 

00:05:02.779 --> 00:05:06.800
 only 20 percent of the contents 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.099
 It's not advertising or advertising 

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:12.529
 induced the screen is riddled with 

00:05:10.099 --> 00:05:13.279
 'miracle' products infomercials 

00:05:12.529 --> 00:05:16.159
 hubbub 

00:05:13.279 --> 00:05:18.050
 to lose weight of bad astrology 

00:05:16.159 --> 00:05:19.610
 screams that the same pontificate of a 

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:22.430
 shaving cream that from a match 

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:24.259
 football have been two decades and it is believed 

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:26.029
 that with two to three national chains of 

00:05:24.259 --> 00:05:28.189
 television this medium enter the 

00:05:26.029 --> 00:05:29.449
 modernity according to the criteria of the 

00:05:28.189 --> 00:05:31.070
 ocde and the demands of many 

00:05:29.449 --> 00:05:33.530
 specialists 

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:35.510
 welcome to that competition but if they go 

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:37.250
 to replicate the same television model 

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:38.780
 we will only have one reproduction at 

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:40.790
 infinite of a television that my 

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:43.000
 client but audiences that mistreats 

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:45.110
 its actors and encumbra the docile 

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.210
 imagine the six newscasts 

00:05:45.110 --> 00:05:48.770
 chains repeating in unison what 

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:51.230
 the federal government wants you to 

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:52.700
 transmit imagine programs 

00:05:51.230 --> 00:05:54.730
 sports in which each chain 

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:57.200
 defend your soccer teams 

00:05:54.730 --> 00:05:58.760
 imagine each chain selling us in 

00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:01.820
 all your programs your offers of 

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:03.530
 internet telephony and video a reform 

00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:05.660
 that only competition privilege 

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:08.000
 convert to convergent content 

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:11.000
 the television telephony and internet 

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.100
 In a large supermarket you can 

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.050
 eliminate economic monopolies but not 

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:16.730
 monopolies of public opinion and less 

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:19.550
 proposes a different model to that of the 

00:06:16.730 --> 00:06:21.680
 television for fucking at this point the 

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:23.360
 constitutional reform that is discussed in 

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:25.880
 the congress of the union does not want 

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:28.730
 enter anything that affects the unique model 

00:06:25.880 --> 00:06:30.620
 of commercial television nothing that offers 

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:33.320
 a public media model that does not 

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:34.970
 government there is not even a 

00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:37.820
 definition of public media in the 

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:39.860
 initiative much less the possibility 

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:42.860
 from the spectrum to community proposals 

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:45.500
 indigenous or university is that the 

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:47.960
 democratization of the media I'm afraid 

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:49.790
 a lot that not if it's the 

00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:51.410
 proliferation of many under the same 

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:52.790
 model that does not incorporate the point of 

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:55.480
 view and the needs of 

00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:55.480
 audiences
