use to game types on this map and those

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.700 
use to game types on this map and those
would<00:00:19.859> be<00:00:19.920> guardians<00:00:20.520> and<00:00:20.730> last<00:00:21.180> stand<00:00:21.710> so

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710 
would be guardians and last stand so

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.800 
would be guardians and last stand so

type that i created and i've been

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.389 
type that i created and i've been
testing<00:00:30.420> working<00:00:31.380> on<00:00:31.470> that<00:00:31.650> for<00:00:31.710> about<00:00:32.040> four

00:00:32.389 --> 00:00:32.399 
testing working on that for about four

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:35.330 
testing working on that for about four
months<00:00:32.630> so<00:00:33.630> in<00:00:33.719> this<00:00:33.809> video<00:00:34.140> we<00:00:34.770> do<00:00:34.920> use<00:00:35.130> the

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:35.340 
months so in this video we do use the

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:37.310 
months so in this video we do use the
last<00:00:35.550> stand<00:00:35.730> game<00:00:36.030> type<00:00:36.270> although<00:00:36.719> you<00:00:37.020> can

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
last stand game type although you can

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.650 
last stand game type although you can
use<00:00:37.350> his<00:00:37.829> own<00:00:38.010> game<00:00:38.190> type<00:00:38.430> which<00:00:39.300> is<00:00:39.480> just

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:39.660 
use his own game type which is just

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.290 
use his own game type which is just
slightly<00:00:39.960> different<00:00:40.410> than<00:00:40.440> mine<00:00:40.710> so<00:00:41.300> protect

00:00:42.290 --> 00:00:42.300 
slightly different than mine so protect

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:44.510 
slightly different than mine so protect
the<00:00:42.420> factory<00:00:42.809> is<00:00:43.110> kind<00:00:43.770> of<00:00:43.860> an<00:00:43.950> interesting

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:44.520 
the factory is kind of an interesting

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.180 
the factory is kind of an interesting
map<00:00:45.000> for<00:00:45.300> a<00:00:45.329> number<00:00:45.600> of<00:00:45.750> reasons<00:00:45.950> the<00:00:46.950> first

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
map for a number of reasons the first

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.279 
map for a number of reasons the first
one<00:00:47.399> being<00:00:47.640> that<00:00:47.730> it<00:00:48.120> is<00:00:48.300> a<00:00:48.329> holdout<00:00:48.899> style

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
one being that it is a holdout style

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.360 
one being that it is a holdout style
flood<00:00:49.680> map<00:00:49.969> so<00:00:50.969> no<00:00:51.420> you<00:00:51.480> cannot<00:00:51.870> jump<00:00:52.370> you're

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:53.370 
flood map so no you cannot jump you're

flood map so no you cannot jump you're
jumping<00:00:53.699> abilities<00:00:54.090> are<00:00:54.270> disabled<00:00:54.840> but

00:00:55.639 --> 00:00:55.649 
jumping abilities are disabled but

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:57.950 
jumping abilities are disabled but
there's<00:00:55.829> actually<00:00:56.160> a<00:00:56.550> lot<00:00:57.000> of<00:00:57.180> things<00:00:57.390> about<00:00:57.570> a

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
there's actually a lot of things about a

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.920 
there's actually a lot of things about a
no<00:00:58.260> jump<00:00:58.530> game<00:00:58.800> type<00:00:59.100> that<00:00:59.430> can<00:00:59.789> benefit<00:01:00.690> the

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
no jump game type that can benefit the

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.219 
no jump game type that can benefit the
style<00:01:01.649> of<00:01:01.770> gameplay<00:01:02.010> and<00:01:02.629> how<00:01:03.629> the<00:01:03.690> maps<00:01:04.019> are

00:01:04.219 --> 00:01:04.229 
style of gameplay and how the maps are

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:06.590 
style of gameplay and how the maps are
forged<00:01:04.769> as<00:01:04.949> well<00:01:05.129> so<00:01:06.119> i'm<00:01:06.180> going<00:01:06.330> to<00:01:06.420> talk<00:01:06.540> a

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:06.600 
forged as well so i'm going to talk a

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.440 
forged as well so i'm going to talk a
little<00:01:06.780> bit<00:01:06.990> about<00:01:07.140> that<00:01:08.000> giving<00:01:09.000> the<00:01:09.090> humans

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:09.450 
little bit about that giving the humans

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:12.200 
little bit about that giving the humans
no<00:01:10.049> jump<00:01:10.350> settings<00:01:10.770> actually<00:01:11.610> can<00:01:11.850> encourage

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
no jump settings actually can encourage

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.289 
no jump settings actually can encourage
a<00:01:12.450> lot<00:01:12.600> more<00:01:12.750> teamwork<00:01:13.939> because<00:01:14.939> if<00:01:15.060> you<00:01:15.150> can

00:01:15.289 --> 00:01:15.299 
a lot more teamwork because if you can

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:17.240 
a lot more teamwork because if you can
just<00:01:15.509> compare<00:01:15.960> that<00:01:16.170> to<00:01:16.229> a<00:01:16.439> freeroll<00:01:16.979> map

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
just compare that to a freeroll map

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.730 
just compare that to a freeroll map
where<00:01:18.180> you<00:01:18.270> can<00:01:18.420> run<00:01:18.630> anywhere<00:01:18.930> you<00:01:19.170> want<00:01:19.409> and

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:19.740 
where you can run anywhere you want and

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.640 
where you can run anywhere you want and
jump<00:01:20.369> to<00:01:20.520> the<00:01:20.640> tallest<00:01:20.880> spots<00:01:21.299> the<00:01:22.080> survivors

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:22.650 
jump to the tallest spots the survivors

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.890 
jump to the tallest spots the survivors
spend<00:01:23.009> most<00:01:23.189> of<00:01:23.430> their<00:01:23.580> time<00:01:23.640> running

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:24.900 
spend most of their time running

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:27.350 
spend most of their time running
in<00:01:25.290> a<00:01:25.590> free<00:01:25.770> roam<00:01:25.950> game<00:01:26.160> type<00:01:26.400> we're<00:01:27.210> in<00:01:27.300> a

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
in a free roam game type we're in a

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.240 
in a free roam game type we're in a
holdup<00:01:27.630> game<00:01:27.870> type<00:01:28.080> the<00:01:28.560> area<00:01:28.860> that<00:01:29.040> you<00:01:29.130> have

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
holdup game type the area that you have

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.580 
holdup game type the area that you have
to<00:01:29.400> defend<00:01:29.670> is<00:01:29.880> much<00:01:30.090> smaller<00:01:30.450> so<00:01:31.380> it

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:31.590 
to defend is much smaller so it

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.070 
to defend is much smaller so it
literally<00:01:31.890> forces<00:01:32.580> not<00:01:33.090> only<00:01:33.390> survivors<00:01:33.960> to

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:34.080 
literally forces not only survivors to

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.160 
literally forces not only survivors to
work<00:01:34.200> together<00:01:34.400> but<00:01:35.400> flood<00:01:35.730> also<00:01:36.150> as<00:01:36.330> they

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
work together but flood also as they

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.290 
work together but flood also as they
tend<00:01:37.590> to<00:01:37.680> make<00:01:37.890> these<00:01:38.130> kind<00:01:38.490> of<00:01:38.580> more

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:39.300 
tend to make these kind of more

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:42.020 
tend to make these kind of more
coordinated<00:01:39.840> pushes<00:01:40.470> into<00:01:40.770> the<00:01:41.340> survivors

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:42.030 
coordinated pushes into the survivors

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.450 
coordinated pushes into the survivors
holdout<00:01:42.390> area<00:01:42.740> so<00:01:43.740> another<00:01:43.920> great<00:01:44.250> thing

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
holdout area so another great thing

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.090 
holdout area so another great thing
about<00:01:44.730> limiting<00:01:45.510> your<00:01:45.630> survivors<00:01:46.230> to<00:01:47.070> a

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
about limiting your survivors to a

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.850 
about limiting your survivors to a
certain<00:01:47.430> area<00:01:47.670> is<00:01:47.880> just<00:01:48.660> a<00:01:48.780> detail<00:01:48.990> you<00:01:49.710> can

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:49.860 
certain area is just a detail you can

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:52.100 
certain area is just a detail you can
put<00:01:50.100> into<00:01:50.310> these<00:01:50.430> maps<00:01:50.700> as<00:01:50.970> you<00:01:51.810> can<00:01:51.930> see

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:52.110 
put into these maps as you can see

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.250 
put into these maps as you can see
sandwich<00:01:52.830> had<00:01:53.070> the<00:01:53.250> budget<00:01:53.580> to<00:01:53.730> include<00:01:54.180> a<00:01:54.600> lot

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:55.260 
sandwich had the budget to include a lot

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.950 
sandwich had the budget to include a lot
of<00:01:55.410> small<00:01:55.740> scale<00:01:55.980> aesthetics<00:01:56.820> which<00:01:57.030> is

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:57.960 
of small scale aesthetics which is

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
something that's normally a bonus to

types<00:02:07.920> is<00:02:08.160> the<00:02:08.940> different<00:02:09.300> ways<00:02:09.450> you<00:02:09.479> can<00:02:09.660> have

types is the different ways you can have

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
flood approach to hold up so you can

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.960 
flood approach to hold up so you can
give<00:02:13.080> flood<00:02:13.410> their<00:02:13.620> own<00:02:13.830> cover<00:02:14.190> their<00:02:14.730> own

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:14.970 
give flood their own cover their own

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:19.100 
give flood their own cover their own

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:19.110 
routes they can they can choose which

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:21.410 
routes they can they can choose which
ways<00:02:19.350> they<00:02:19.620> want<00:02:19.800> to<00:02:19.890> approach<00:02:20.190> the<00:02:20.670> survivors

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:21.420

area without getting mauled in the open
sightlines<00:02:25.350> because<00:02:25.980> you<00:02:26.580> can<00:02:26.760> plan<00:02:26.970> for

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000 
sightlines because you can plan for

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.560 
sightlines because you can plan for
their<00:02:27.330> cover<00:02:27.600> a<00:02:27.990> much<00:02:28.740> more<00:02:29.160> and<00:02:29.430> I<00:02:30.209> think

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.570 
their cover a much more and I think

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:32.120 
their cover a much more and I think
that's<00:02:30.720> pretty<00:02:30.900> cool<00:02:31.200> because<00:02:31.470> it<00:02:31.830> kind<00:02:32.040> of

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:32.130 
that's pretty cool because it kind of

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.430 
that's pretty cool because it kind of
increases<00:02:32.790> the<00:02:33.090> longevity<00:02:33.540> of<00:02:34.019> the<00:02:34.230> map

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:34.440 
increases the longevity of the map

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.410 
increases the longevity of the map
because<00:02:35.340> you're<00:02:35.640> getting<00:02:35.790> a<00:02:36.150> different

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
because you're getting a different

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:38.930 
because you're getting a different
experience<00:02:37.019> each<00:02:37.470> time<00:02:37.860> you<00:02:38.100> change<00:02:38.730> from

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:38.940 
experience each time you change from

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.960 
experience each time you change from
Survivor<00:02:39.330> to<00:02:39.570> flood<00:02:40.250> so<00:02:41.250> it<00:02:41.580> definitely

00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:41.970 
Survivor to flood so it definitely

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.720 
Survivor to flood so it definitely
doesn't<00:02:42.390> feel<00:02:42.510> is<00:02:42.959> recycled<00:02:43.920> I<00:02:44.160> guess<00:02:44.489> is<00:02:44.700> a

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:44.730 
doesn't feel is recycled I guess is a

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.110 
doesn't feel is recycled I guess is a
good<00:02:44.820> word<00:02:45.150> for<00:02:45.180> it<00:02:45.540> and<00:02:46.100> it<00:02:47.100> also<00:02:47.250> allows<00:02:47.940> you

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
good word for it and it also allows you

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.870 
good word for it and it also allows you
to<00:02:48.209> plan<00:02:48.420> out<00:02:48.600> your<00:02:48.630> sight<00:02:48.959> lines<00:02:49.820> from<00:02:50.820> the

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:50.880 
to plan out your sight lines from the

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:53.300 
to plan out your sight lines from the
holdout<00:02:51.239> itself<00:02:51.680> and<00:02:52.680> it<00:02:52.860> kind<00:02:53.010> of<00:02:53.070> gives<00:02:53.190> you

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.310 
holdout itself and it kind of gives you

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:55.040 
holdout itself and it kind of gives you
that<00:02:53.489> classic<00:02:53.970> zombie<00:02:54.150> feel<00:02:54.540> having<00:02:54.870> those

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:55.050 
that classic zombie feel having those

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:58.040 
that classic zombie feel having those
boarded<00:02:55.709> up<00:02:55.830> windows<00:02:56.450> so<00:02:57.450> my<00:02:57.600> favorite<00:02:57.900> thing

00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:58.050 
boarded up windows so my favorite thing

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.170 
boarded up windows so my favorite thing
about<00:02:58.080> the<00:02:58.470> map<00:02:58.680> definitely<00:02:59.610> has<00:02:59.760> to<00:02:59.940> be<00:03:00.030> the

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:00.180 
about the map definitely has to be the

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.390 
about the map definitely has to be the
lighting<00:03:00.570> I<00:03:00.750> know<00:03:01.470> there's<00:03:01.739> not<00:03:02.070> a<00:03:02.130> lot<00:03:02.370> of

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:02.400 
lighting I know there's not a lot of

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:04.670 
lighting I know there's not a lot of
bright<00:03:02.700> areas<00:03:03.150> to<00:03:03.360> the<00:03:03.480> map<00:03:03.660> but<00:03:04.260> what<00:03:04.470> I<00:03:04.500> mean

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
bright areas to the map but what I mean

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.460 
bright areas to the map but what I mean
is<00:03:04.739> the<00:03:05.040> combination<00:03:05.489> of<00:03:06.090> lights<00:03:06.630> and<00:03:06.900> effects

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.470 
is the combination of lights and effects

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:10.070 
is the combination of lights and effects
he<00:03:07.709> has<00:03:07.950> is<00:03:08.250> kind<00:03:09.060> of<00:03:09.120> brought<00:03:09.510> out<00:03:09.660> certain

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:10.080 
he has is kind of brought out certain

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.500 
he has is kind of brought out certain
textures<00:03:10.739> in<00:03:10.890> the<00:03:10.980> pieces<00:03:11.370> and<00:03:11.549> it<00:03:12.390> actually

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
textures in the pieces and it actually

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.509 
textures in the pieces and it actually
makes<00:03:12.810> the<00:03:12.900> scenery<00:03:13.350> objects<00:03:13.830> look<00:03:14.070> really

00:03:14.509 --> 00:03:14.519 
makes the scenery objects look really

00:03:14.519 --> 00:03:18.800 
makes the scenery objects look really
great<00:03:14.850> as<00:03:15.060> well<00:03:16.400> they<00:03:17.400> usually<00:03:17.880> just<00:03:18.150> look

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:18.810 
great as well they usually just look

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.440 
great as well they usually just look
very<00:03:18.840> dark<00:03:19.530> and<00:03:19.769> don't<00:03:20.430> stand<00:03:20.730> out<00:03:21.000> in<00:03:21.060> most

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
very dark and don't stand out in most

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.750 
very dark and don't stand out in most
