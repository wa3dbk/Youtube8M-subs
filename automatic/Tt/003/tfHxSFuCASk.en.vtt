if he rose from the dead and that means
what<00:00:36.059> he<00:00:36.210> says<00:00:36.540> is<00:00:36.960> true<00:00:37.020> people<00:00:37.860> don't<00:00:38.190> rise

evidence without saying I believe in a
closed<00:00:58.320> universe<00:00:58.440> if<00:00:59.129> you'll<00:00:59.370> wrestle<00:01:00.149> with

think the safest position for us to be

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:05.420 
think the safest position for us to be
on<00:02:03.270> when<00:02:03.479> it<00:02:03.570> comes<00:02:03.840> to<00:02:04.140> what<00:02:04.380> the<00:02:04.409> Bible<00:02:04.890> is<00:02:05.040> is

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:05.430 
on when it comes to what the Bible is is

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.119 
on when it comes to what the Bible is is
whatever<00:02:06.390> Jesus<00:02:06.689> position<00:02:07.350> is<00:02:07.469> that's<00:02:07.860> where

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:08.129 
whatever Jesus position is that's where

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:10.940 
whatever Jesus position is that's where
I<00:02:08.160> want<00:02:08.429> to<00:02:08.459> stand<00:02:08.670> and<00:02:09.030> so<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:10.050> way<00:02:10.229> I<00:02:10.259> come<00:02:10.739> to

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
I want to stand and so the way I come to

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.040 
I want to stand and so the way I come to
scriptures<00:02:11.370> I<00:02:11.580> say<00:02:11.819> what<00:02:12.480> is<00:02:12.629> it<00:02:12.780> that<00:02:12.900> he

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.050 
scriptures I say what is it that he

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.640 
scriptures I say what is it that he
believes<00:02:13.379> about

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
believes about

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.679 
believes about
this<00:02:13.799> because<00:02:14.250> I<00:02:14.489> have<00:02:14.879> a<00:02:14.909> very<00:02:15.420> strong

00:02:15.679 --> 00:02:15.689 
this because I have a very strong

00:02:15.689 --> 00:02:17.149 
this because I have a very strong
conviction<00:02:16.170> that<00:02:16.200> he<00:02:16.470> was<00:02:16.650> raised<00:02:16.890> from<00:02:17.069> the

00:02:17.149 --> 00:02:17.159 
conviction that he was raised from the

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:19.699 
conviction that he was raised from the
dead<00:02:17.189> and<00:02:17.930> therefore<00:02:18.930> he's<00:02:19.439> going<00:02:19.650> to

00:02:19.699 --> 00:02:19.709 
dead and therefore he's going to

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:21.500 
dead and therefore he's going to
authorize<00:02:20.129> these<00:02:20.400> apostles<00:02:21.000> to<00:02:21.180> write<00:02:21.329> these

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
authorize these apostles to write these

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:24.020 
authorize these apostles to write these
books<00:02:21.569> about<00:02:22.230> him<00:02:22.530> and<00:02:23.489> we<00:02:23.730> have<00:02:23.909> these

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:24.030 
books about him and we have these

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:26.149 
books about him and we have these
Gospels<00:02:24.360> written<00:02:25.170> either<00:02:25.260> by<00:02:25.500> eyewitnesses

00:02:26.149 --> 00:02:26.159 
Gospels written either by eyewitnesses

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:30.050 
Gospels written either by eyewitnesses
or<00:02:26.340> good<00:02:26.489> historians<00:02:27.090> or<00:02:27.239> apostles<00:02:29.060> we're

or good historians or apostles we're

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.420 
or good historians or apostles we're
dealing<00:02:30.420> with<00:02:30.450> a<00:02:30.959> level<00:02:31.739> of<00:02:31.859> authority<00:02:32.400> that

dealing with a level of authority that

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:35.569 
dealing with a level of authority that
is<00:02:33.200> because<00:02:34.200> of<00:02:34.319> his<00:02:34.560> authority<00:02:35.010> the<00:02:35.280> Bible

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:35.579 
is because of his authority the Bible

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:36.770 
is because of his authority the Bible
has<00:02:35.730> Authority<00:02:36.090> it's<00:02:36.180> what<00:02:36.299> it<00:02:36.390> comes<00:02:36.540> down<00:02:36.720> to

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
has Authority it's what it comes down to

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.619 
has Authority it's what it comes down to
if<00:02:37.500> he<00:02:37.769> wasn't<00:02:38.129> raised<00:02:38.280> from<00:02:38.459> the<00:02:38.549> dead<00:02:38.629> this

00:02:39.619 --> 00:02:39.629 
if he wasn't raised from the dead this

00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:41.089 
if he wasn't raised from the dead this
thing<00:02:39.870> is<00:02:39.989> worthless<00:02:40.170> as<00:02:40.739> far<00:02:40.920> as<00:02:40.980> I'm

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:00.389 
the kind of authority he speaks with is

00:03:00.389 --> 00:03:03.319 
the kind of authority he speaks with is
more<00:03:00.840> sure<00:03:01.290> more<00:03:02.040> certain<00:03:02.489> more<00:03:02.970> firmly
