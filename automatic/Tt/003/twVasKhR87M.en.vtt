 sales supply market all that is possible and 

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:41.079
 yet soon the Bolsheviks came to their senses

 so in the place Kopore was built 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:56.409
 research and production center here 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:04:00.819

00:04:35.889 --> 00:04:41.199
 cabbage 

00:04:37.590 --> 00:04:41.830
 from the value of this drink say two 

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:47.349
 of fact 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:49.990

 grouping north field marshal general 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:55.599
 von leeb receives a strange order from 

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:57.250
 Hitler instead of moving in 

00:04:55.599 --> 00:05:00.250
 direction to Leningrad 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:03.370
 Leib's dream should send tanks to 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:05.620
 copore to destroy the river object 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:07.919
 life under this code name 

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:11.169
 hiding experimental laboratory 

00:05:07.919 --> 00:05:13.419
 which made herbal drinks by 

00:05:11.169 --> 00:05:15.479
 old Russian recipes based 

00:05:13.419 --> 00:05:18.210
 which was use exactly 

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:22.289
 Ivan-tea 

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:24.550
 Hitler was generally very afraid he was afraid 

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:27.550
 moreover mystical he had fear 

00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:30.909
 before this drink because it was thought 

00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:34.949
 that he gives strength to Russian soldiers 

00:05:30.909 --> 00:05:34.949
 invincibility forces 

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:40.370
 German strategies have changed direction 

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:43.310
 the main attack and even put under 

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:46.190
 threat barbarossa plan in order to 

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:48.110
 destroy just a few labs and 

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:50.780
 manufacturing factory 

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:56.210
 Ivan-tea does not confirm 

00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:58.520
 the uniqueness of the Russian drink 2 is 

00:05:56.210 --> 00:06:01.400
 very strong grass that is it grows 

00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:04.460
 after the fire the fire went through the first 

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:07.160
 plant that is sowing which 

00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:10.250
 germinates here seemingly unusable 

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:13.130
 the earth is Ivan-tea in it to such 

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:15.230
 degrees many lives on forces so there where 

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:17.900
 he grows others do not grow weeds then 

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:22.509
 there is he first strong 1 makes his way 

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:26.659
 yes this is life energy and plus 

00:06:22.509 --> 00:06:29.599
 the same he wildly rose de karos 

00:06:26.659 --> 00:06:33.260
 This means that in the life of this plant 

00:06:29.599 --> 00:06:36.320
 man never interfered 

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:37.730
 we have a paradoxical situation in Russia 

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:39.830
 now this 

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:42.460
 Ivan-tea he grows as a weed and 

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:45.860
 growing everywhere in the fields 

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:48.890
 huge plantations that could 

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:51.350
 call china and india together but 

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:55.760
 Nobody knows what of this Ivan tea 

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:58.040
 You can make real tea Ivan-tea 

00:06:55.760 --> 00:07:02.290
 already useful because it is not 

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:02.290
 genetically modified grass
