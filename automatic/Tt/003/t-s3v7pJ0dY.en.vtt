00:00:01.372 --> 00:00:05.272
As I think back the case had been
disturbingly strange from the start.

00:00:08.092 --> 00:00:11.312
I didn’t even remember when I
had been commissioned last.

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:14.399
Or when was the last time I had a dream.

00:00:15.572 --> 00:00:16.492
Hello.

00:00:16.985 --> 00:00:18.705
Hello.

00:00:19.085 --> 00:00:20.805
I didn’t hear you come in.

00:00:21.181 --> 00:00:22.701
I didn’t want to disturb you.

00:00:23.116 --> 00:00:24.336
Can I help you?

00:00:26.183 --> 00:00:27.903
You are a detective?

00:00:30.403 --> 00:00:31.523
What is it you want?

00:00:37.759 --> 00:00:39.879
As the bus passed through Tavistock Square,

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:43.370
Hussain detonated the bomb in his backpack.

00:00:45.526 --> 00:00:49.026
Below ground, subterranean London
was a world of smoke and fear,

00:00:49.194 --> 00:00:52.614
twisted metal and bone fragments

00:00:53.996 --> 00:00:56.896
a world of darkness, despair and death.

00:00:58.174 --> 00:01:00.194
It’s just a pulp novel to pass the time.

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:02.439
I read about bombs…

00:01:02.494 --> 00:01:03.214
Do you think so?

00:01:03.264 --> 00:01:03.984
…about names…

00:01:04.055 --> 00:01:06.675
I want you to find him.

00:01:09.076 --> 00:01:10.196
Find who?

00:01:12.256 --> 00:01:13.376
…precise numbers…

00:01:14.914 --> 00:01:16.034
Mike Longshott

00:01:16.133 --> 00:01:17.833
The guy who writes this stuff?

00:01:17.836 --> 00:01:18.356
Yes.

00:01:19.055 --> 00:01:22.775
…things that could never happen in my world.

00:01:28.212 --> 00:01:30.812
I thought my only job was to find a writer

00:01:31.268 --> 00:01:33.068
who writes about bombs and assassinations,

00:01:37.016 --> 00:01:39.536
about a secret war without soldiers.

00:01:39.952 --> 00:01:41.652
You don’t like girls?

00:01:45.867 --> 00:01:47.867
Where’s a good place to get a drink around here?

00:01:47.999 --> 00:01:50.299
From where I'm standing everywhere
is a good place for a drink.

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:53.309
I have to find Papadopoulos.

00:01:53.461 --> 00:01:54.281
I haven't seen him.

00:01:55.061 --> 00:01:56.481
Did you ever go back with him to his place?

00:01:57.365 --> 00:01:58.485
I dont know where he lives.

00:01:58.585 --> 00:01:59.485
Longshott, Longshott...

00:01:59.725 --> 00:02:01.825
 I wish I'd never heard the name.

00:02:01.917 --> 00:02:03.337
Who writes the books?

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:04.480
Sells like hot cakes.

00:02:05.312 --> 00:02:07.232
Better than Slut, even.

00:02:08.507 --> 00:02:11.707
I thought what I am reading
doesn't affect my world.

00:02:12.039 --> 00:02:12.839
I was wrong.

00:02:13.218 --> 00:02:15.618
Yes, I read the books. A lot of bullshit in them.

00:02:15.652 --> 00:02:18.052
Why you not give up? 
You have good life, before.

00:02:18.179 --> 00:02:20.399
If you get stuck
try looking out for Madame Se—

00:02:28.119 --> 00:02:29.719
"BUT WHERE?"

00:02:33.419 --> 00:02:34.539
Who is this Mike Longshott?

00:02:36.073 --> 00:02:37.093
And who are you,

00:02:38.325 --> 00:02:39.445
Osama bin Laden?

00:02:40.836 --> 00:02:42.356
Who is the man who writes the books?

00:02:43.164 --> 00:02:44.584
You shouldn't be here...

00:02:45.135 --> 00:02:47.655
None of us should.
