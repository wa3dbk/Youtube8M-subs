researcher / Sony Computer Entertainment
and<00:00:11.969> I<00:00:12.059> worked<00:00:12.330> on<00:00:12.450> the<00:00:12.660> PlayStation<00:00:13.230> Move

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
and I worked on the PlayStation Move

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.429 
and I worked on the PlayStation Move
project<00:00:14.000> you<00:00:15.000> talk<00:00:15.269> about<00:00:15.570> where<00:00:15.929> the<00:00:16.080> idea<00:00:16.349> of

00:00:16.429 --> 00:00:16.439 
project you talk about where the idea of

00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:19.730 
project you talk about where the idea of
removed<00:00:16.710> came<00:00:16.920> from<00:00:17.160> so<00:00:18.230> actually<00:00:19.230> we've

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:19.740 
removed came from so actually we've

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:22.550 
removed came from so actually we've
worked<00:00:19.980> on<00:00:20.450> this<00:00:21.450> kind<00:00:21.660> of<00:00:21.779> technology<00:00:22.080> for<00:00:22.529> a

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:22.560 
worked on this kind of technology for a

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.439 
worked on this kind of technology for a
long<00:00:22.770> time<00:00:23.040> we<00:00:23.070> started<00:00:23.609> with<00:00:23.730> I<00:00:23.880> toy<00:00:24.090> and<00:00:24.390> I

00:00:24.439 --> 00:00:24.449 
long time we started with I toy and I

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:26.740 
long time we started with I toy and I
worked<00:00:24.660> on<00:00:24.779> the<00:00:24.960> original<00:00:25.050> I<00:00:25.470> toy<00:00:25.650> product<00:00:26.130> and

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:26.750 
worked on the original I toy product and

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:29.269 
worked on the original I toy product and
then<00:00:27.750> we've<00:00:28.260> evolved<00:00:28.680> that<00:00:28.769> over<00:00:29.039> the<00:00:29.130> last

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
then we've evolved that over the last

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.070 
then we've evolved that over the last
year's<00:00:29.670> and<00:00:29.910> kind<00:00:30.359> of<00:00:30.420> looked<00:00:30.660> at<00:00:30.810> all<00:00:30.930> the

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
year's and kind of looked at all the

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.780 
year's and kind of looked at all the
different<00:00:31.170> possible<00:00:31.710> new<00:00:31.859> technologies<00:00:32.550> and

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
different possible new technologies and

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:35.590 
different possible new technologies and
then<00:00:33.720> are<00:00:33.870> enabled<00:00:34.230> by<00:00:34.290> like<00:00:34.620> MEMS<00:00:35.129> technology

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:35.600 
then are enabled by like MEMS technology

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:38.570 
then are enabled by like MEMS technology
micromachining<00:00:36.600> and<00:00:36.930> move<00:00:37.650> you<00:00:37.800> jarrow<00:00:38.160> and

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:38.580 
micromachining and move you jarrow and

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:40.070 
micromachining and move you jarrow and
accelerometer<00:00:39.269> sensors<00:00:39.600> are<00:00:39.750> happening

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:40.080 
accelerometer sensors are happening

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.680 
accelerometer sensors are happening
they're<00:00:40.199> already<00:00:40.440> in<00:00:40.650> the<00:00:40.729> in<00:00:41.729> the<00:00:41.790> DualShock

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:42.690 
they're already in the in the DualShock

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.020 
they're already in the in the DualShock
and<00:00:42.900> six<00:00:43.080> axis<00:00:43.409> we<00:00:43.979> took<00:00:44.400> all<00:00:44.580> that<00:00:44.699> technology

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030 
and six axis we took all that technology

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.119 
and six axis we took all that technology
and<00:00:45.600> trying<00:00:46.199> to<00:00:46.320> just<00:00:46.530> put<00:00:46.799> it<00:00:46.890> all<00:00:47.010> together

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
and trying to just put it all together

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:48.590 
and trying to just put it all together
into<00:00:47.309> the<00:00:47.549> best<00:00:47.699> possible<00:00:48.120> thing<00:00:48.210> we<00:00:48.330> can<00:00:48.449> make

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:48.600 
into the best possible thing we can make

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:51.469 
into the best possible thing we can make
and<00:00:49.589> when<00:00:49.769> it<00:00:49.860> comes<00:00:50.129> to<00:00:50.430> move<00:00:50.940> can<00:00:51.180> you<00:00:51.269> talk<00:00:51.420> a

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:51.479 
and when it comes to move can you talk a

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:53.270 
and when it comes to move can you talk a
little<00:00:51.629> about<00:00:51.839> what<00:00:52.350> that<00:00:52.650> adds<00:00:52.890> to<00:00:53.100> the

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
little about what that adds to the

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.729 
little about what that adds to the
gameplay<00:00:53.489> experience<00:00:54.119> so<00:00:54.989> PlayStation<00:00:55.589> Move

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
gameplay experience so PlayStation Move

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:58.369 
gameplay experience so PlayStation Move
really<00:00:56.519> is<00:00:56.699> very<00:00:57.030> fast<00:00:57.479> and<00:00:57.750> precise<00:00:58.140> at

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
really is very fast and precise at

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:00.020 
really is very fast and precise at
tracking<00:00:58.650> what<00:00:58.979> you're<00:00:59.159> doing<00:00:59.549> with<00:00:59.850> the

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
tracking what you're doing with the

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.759 
tracking what you're doing with the
controller<00:01:00.390> so<00:01:00.960> that<00:01:01.229> gives<00:01:01.409> you<00:01:01.559> the<00:01:01.589> ability

00:01:01.759 --> 00:01:01.769 
controller so that gives you the ability

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:04.490 
controller so that gives you the ability
to<00:01:02.070> do<00:01:02.369> very<00:01:02.699> fast<00:01:03.000> actions<00:01:03.479> and<00:01:03.659> very<00:01:04.110> fine

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
to do very fast actions and very fine

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.580 
to do very fast actions and very fine
actions<00:01:05.489> like<00:01:05.610> pointing<00:01:06.090> precisely<00:01:06.479> or<00:01:07.080> you

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590 
actions like pointing precisely or you

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:08.840 
actions like pointing precisely or you
can<00:01:07.680> actually<00:01:07.830> reach<00:01:08.130> out<00:01:08.340> and<00:01:08.520> pick<00:01:08.700> things

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:08.850 
can actually reach out and pick things

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.330 
can actually reach out and pick things
up<00:01:09.119> and<00:01:09.390> place<00:01:09.659> them<00:01:09.900> and<00:01:10.020> stack<00:01:10.260> them<00:01:10.470> and<00:01:10.830> I

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:11.340 
up and place them and stack them and I

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.730 
up and place them and stack them and I
like<00:01:11.490> on<00:01:11.640> a<00:01:11.670> large<00:01:12.240> pile<00:01:13.050> of<00:01:13.080> blocks<00:01:13.500> or

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:13.740 
like on a large pile of blocks or

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:15.110 
like on a large pile of blocks or
something<00:01:13.860> it's<00:01:14.160> so<00:01:14.520> all<00:01:14.790> these<00:01:14.940> different

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:15.120 
something it's so all these different

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:16.910 
something it's so all these different
things<00:01:15.300> that<00:01:15.540> you<00:01:15.600> can<00:01:15.660> do<00:01:15.930> with<00:01:15.960> it<00:01:16.260> really

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:16.920 
things that you can do with it really

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.170 
things that you can do with it really
translate<00:01:17.340> into<00:01:17.490> any<00:01:17.730> kind<00:01:17.970> of<00:01:18.030> game

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
translate into any kind of game

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.910 
translate into any kind of game
experience<00:01:18.600> you<00:01:18.660> want<00:01:18.750> to<00:01:18.870> create<00:01:19.050> with<00:01:19.230> it<00:01:19.380> so

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
experience you want to create with it so

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.070 
experience you want to create with it so
it<00:01:20.220> really<00:01:20.640> has<00:01:20.790> a<00:01:20.820> wide<00:01:21.060> breadth<00:01:21.480> of<00:01:21.780> game

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:22.080 
it really has a wide breadth of game

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.530 
it really has a wide breadth of game
possibility<00:01:22.740> and<00:01:23.460> when<00:01:23.820> it<00:01:23.910> comes<00:01:24.090> to<00:01:24.390> the

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
possibility and when it comes to the

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.180 
possibility and when it comes to the
technology<00:01:25.140> what's<00:01:25.380> inside<00:01:25.770> of<00:01:25.800> it<00:01:25.980> what's

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:26.190 
technology what's inside of it what's

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:28.340 
technology what's inside of it what's
making<00:01:26.520> a<00:01:26.580> tick<00:01:26.820> so<00:01:27.360> the<00:01:27.690> way<00:01:27.780> it<00:01:27.810> works<00:01:27.930> is

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:28.350 
making a tick so the way it works is

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.550 
making a tick so the way it works is
it's<00:01:28.590> got<00:01:28.740> a<00:01:28.980> spear<00:01:29.490> and<00:01:29.670> a<00:01:30.450> glowing<00:01:31.230> light<00:01:31.440> on

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:31.560 
it's got a spear and a glowing light on

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.470 
it's got a spear and a glowing light on
the<00:01:31.650> inside<00:01:31.890> which<00:01:32.070> can<00:01:32.220> change<00:01:32.460> color<00:01:32.730> based

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:33.480 
the inside which can change color based

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.720 
the inside which can change color based
on<00:01:33.630> what<00:01:33.810> the<00:01:33.930> game<00:01:34.080> wants<00:01:34.440> it<00:01:34.530> to<00:01:34.620> be<00:01:34.650> and<00:01:35.010> the

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:35.730 
on what the game wants it to be and the

3<00:01:47.460> so<00:01:47.790> we<00:01:47.880> mix<00:01:48.090> all<00:01:48.240> that<00:01:48.270> data<00:01:48.570> together

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:48.750 
3 so we mix all that data together

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:50.570 
3 so we mix all that data together
really<00:01:49.320> fast<00:01:49.440> to<00:01:49.950> get<00:01:50.070> a<00:01:50.130> really

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:50.580 
really fast to get a really

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.020 
really fast to get a really
comprehensive<00:01:51.409> set<00:01:52.409> of<00:01:52.440> what<00:01:52.680> your<00:01:52.830> motion<00:01:53.159> is

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
comprehensive set of what your motion is

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:56.030 
comprehensive set of what your motion is
can<00:01:54.600> you<00:01:54.690> talk<00:01:54.810> to<00:01:54.960> them<00:01:55.080> about<00:01:55.170> the<00:01:55.770> games

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
can you talk to them about the games

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.890 
can you talk to them about the games
that<00:01:56.220> we're<00:01:56.460> seeing<00:01:56.640> now<00:01:56.820> and<00:01:57.360> how<00:01:57.540> you<00:01:57.600> see

00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:57.900 
that we're seeing now and how you see

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:59.570 
that we're seeing now and how you see
this<00:01:57.990> technology<00:01:58.590> evolving<00:01:59.070> beyond<00:01:59.340> that

00:01:59.570 --> 00:01:59.580 
this technology evolving beyond that

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:03.109 
this technology evolving beyond that
right<00:02:00.150> so<00:02:00.330> as<00:02:00.690> usual<00:02:01.380> with<00:02:02.190> a<00:02:02.220> new<00:02:02.759> kind<00:02:02.970> of

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
right so as usual with a new kind of

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:04.880 
right so as usual with a new kind of
technology<00:02:03.509> like<00:02:03.720> this<00:02:03.750> it<00:02:04.350> takes<00:02:04.590> some<00:02:04.740> time

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890 
technology like this it takes some time

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.020 
technology like this it takes some time
for<00:02:04.950> people<00:02:05.250> to<00:02:05.369> figure<00:02:05.580> out<00:02:05.700> all<00:02:05.909> the

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:06.030 
for people to figure out all the

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.460 
for people to figure out all the
different<00:02:06.060> things<00:02:06.479> that<00:02:06.540> can<00:02:06.720> do<00:02:06.869> I<00:02:07.049> think

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:07.470 
different things that can do I think

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:09.350 
different things that can do I think
what's<00:02:07.860> really<00:02:08.009> amazing<00:02:08.369> here<00:02:08.880> today<00:02:09.179> is

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
what's really amazing here today is

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.940 
what's really amazing here today is
we're<00:02:09.509> seeing<00:02:09.720> such<00:02:10.020> a<00:02:10.050> wide<00:02:10.380> range<00:02:10.619> of<00:02:10.830> things

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:10.950 
we're seeing such a wide range of things

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.090 
we're seeing such a wide range of things
already<00:02:11.400> we<00:02:11.970> have<00:02:12.150> kind<00:02:12.690> of<00:02:12.720> a<00:02:12.810> hardcore<00:02:13.350> kind

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:14.100 
already we have kind of a hardcore kind

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.610 
already we have kind of a hardcore kind
of<00:02:14.220> fighting<00:02:14.880> and<00:02:15.090> shooting<00:02:15.810> games<00:02:16.170> mixed

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:16.620 
of fighting and shooting games mixed

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.910 
of fighting and shooting games mixed
with<00:02:16.770> such<00:02:17.489> other<00:02:17.819> games<00:02:18.750> like<00:02:18.840> a<00:02:18.989> party<00:02:19.770> game

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:19.920 
with such other games like a party game

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.320 
with such other games like a party game
a<00:02:20.310> pet<00:02:21.120> game<00:02:21.390> iPad<00:02:21.959> and<00:02:22.880> it's<00:02:23.880> just<00:02:24.120> it's

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
a pet game iPad and it's just it's

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:26.330 
a pet game iPad and it's just it's
really<00:02:25.050> amazing<00:02:25.200> to<00:02:25.410> see<00:02:25.560> already<00:02:25.920> that<00:02:26.100> we

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:26.340 
really amazing to see already that we

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.280 
really amazing to see already that we
have<00:02:26.459> such<00:02:26.640> a<00:02:26.670> wide<00:02:26.880> very<00:02:27.239> set<00:02:27.810> of<00:02:27.930> experiences

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:28.290 
have such a wide very set of experiences

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:29.600 
have such a wide very set of experiences
and<00:02:28.650> I<00:02:28.680> think<00:02:28.890> that's<00:02:29.280> just<00:02:29.340> going<00:02:29.519> to

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:29.610 
and I think that's just going to

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:30.949 
and I think that's just going to
continue<00:02:29.760> because<00:02:30.330> I<00:02:30.420> think<00:02:30.600> the<00:02:30.690> technology

00:02:30.949 --> 00:02:30.959 
continue because I think the technology

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:33.410 
continue because I think the technology
has<00:02:31.200> a<00:02:31.320> lot<00:02:31.530> of<00:02:31.560> legs<00:02:31.860> people<00:02:32.610> keep<00:02:32.940> doing<00:02:33.300> new

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.420 
has a lot of legs people keep doing new

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:36.410 
has a lot of legs people keep doing new
things<00:02:33.450> with<00:02:33.810> it<00:02:33.989> so<00:02:34.860> I<00:02:35.250> think<00:02:35.730> there's<00:02:36.239> just

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:36.420 
things with it so I think there's just

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:37.610 
things with it so I think there's just
really<00:02:36.600> no<00:02:36.750> limit<00:02:37.019> to<00:02:37.260> what<00:02:37.290> we're<00:02:37.440> going<00:02:37.530> to

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
really no limit to what we're going to

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.890 
really no limit to what we're going to
see<00:02:37.769> inter<00:02:38.580> correlation<00:02:38.790> between<00:02:39.269> how<00:02:39.690> you've

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
see inter correlation between how you've

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.900 
see inter correlation between how you've
seen<00:02:40.140> the<00:02:40.290> eyetoy<00:02:40.769> technology<00:02:41.400> evolved<00:02:41.730> over

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:41.910 
seen the eyetoy technology evolved over

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.460 
seen the eyetoy technology evolved over
the<00:02:42.060> years<00:02:42.150> with<00:02:42.450> games<00:02:42.690> and<00:02:42.930> how<00:02:43.080> you<00:02:43.140> see

00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:43.470 
the years with games and how you see

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:46.790 
the years with games and how you see
move<00:02:44.040> moving<00:02:44.790> forward<00:02:45.090> so<00:02:45.560> based<00:02:46.560> on<00:02:46.739> what

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
move moving forward so based on what

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.490 
move moving forward so based on what
happened<00:02:47.459> with<00:02:47.580> I<00:02:47.610> toy<00:02:47.880> we<00:02:48.180> we<00:02:48.840> made<00:02:49.110> I<00:02:49.140> joined

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
happened with I toy we we made I joined

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:50.900 
happened with I toy we we made I joined
it<00:02:49.590> was<00:02:49.680> really<00:02:49.890> successful<00:02:50.040> but<00:02:50.489> we<00:02:50.610> kind<00:02:50.850> of

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:50.910 
it was really successful but we kind of

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:53.030 
it was really successful but we kind of
reached<00:02:51.120> a<00:02:51.269> wall<00:02:51.569> there<00:02:52.170> was<00:02:52.290> a<00:02:52.319> limit<00:02:52.560> of<00:02:52.769> what

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
reached a wall there was a limit of what

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.800 
reached a wall there was a limit of what
kind<00:02:53.250> of<00:02:53.280> experiences<00:02:53.790> we<00:02:53.940> can<00:02:54.090> enable<00:02:54.510> with

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:54.810 
kind of experiences we can enable with

00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:57.290 
kind of experiences we can enable with
the<00:02:54.959> site<00:02:55.170> and<00:02:55.980> that<00:02:56.040> really<00:02:56.640> is<00:02:56.790> kind<00:02:57.060> of<00:02:57.180> what

00:02:57.290 --> 00:02:57.300 
the site and that really is kind of what

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.780 
the site and that really is kind of what
prompted<00:02:57.660> us<00:02:57.780> to<00:02:57.989> make<00:02:58.110> this<00:02:58.410> this<00:02:59.070> gives<00:02:59.459> very

00:02:59.780 --> 00:02:59.790 
prompted us to make this this gives very

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:02.900 
prompted us to make this this gives very
fast<00:03:00.269> precise<00:03:00.780> motion<00:03:01.739> information<00:03:02.010> spatial

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
fast precise motion information spatial

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.699 
fast precise motion information spatial
information<00:03:03.120> but<00:03:03.959> we<00:03:04.049> also<00:03:04.260> have<00:03:04.560> the

00:03:04.699 --> 00:03:04.709 
information but we also have the

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:06.830 
information but we also have the
traditional<00:03:04.860> kind<00:03:05.370> of<00:03:05.519> button<00:03:06.030> presses<00:03:06.540> and

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:06.840 
traditional kind of button presses and

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:10.640 
traditional kind of button presses and
the<00:03:07.440> analog<00:03:08.540> input<00:03:09.540> that<00:03:09.690> we<00:03:09.720> want<00:03:10.019> from<00:03:10.320> a

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
the analog input that we want from a

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.650 
the analog input that we want from a
traditional<00:03:11.489> controller<00:03:11.850> so<00:03:12.239> it<00:03:12.329> gives<00:03:12.420> us

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
traditional controller so it gives us

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.690 
traditional controller so it gives us
kind<00:03:12.810> of<00:03:12.959> a<00:03:13.049> mix<00:03:13.290> of<00:03:13.440> both<00:03:13.470> worlds<00:03:14.040> spatial<00:03:14.489> and

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:14.700 
kind of a mix of both worlds spatial and

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:17.180 
kind of a mix of both worlds spatial and
action<00:03:15.120> and<00:03:15.630> that's<00:03:15.810> really<00:03:16.079> what<00:03:16.739> we<00:03:16.950> think

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
action and that's really what we think

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:19.130 
action and that's really what we think
can<00:03:17.310> enable<00:03:17.790> a<00:03:17.970> wider<00:03:18.180> set<00:03:18.420> of<00:03:18.450> experiences<00:03:18.780> I

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:19.140 
can enable a wider set of experiences I

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.140 
can enable a wider set of experiences I
toy<00:03:19.590> was<00:03:19.860> great<00:03:20.100> but<00:03:20.310> it<00:03:20.370> kind<00:03:20.640> of<00:03:20.730> reached<00:03:21.030> a

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
toy was great but it kind of reached a

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.650 
toy was great but it kind of reached a
limit<00:03:21.440> when<00:03:22.440> it<00:03:22.470> comes<00:03:22.769> to<00:03:23.070> the<00:03:23.850> potential<00:03:24.239> of

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:24.660 
limit when it comes to the potential of

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.330 
limit when it comes to the potential of
expanding<00:03:25.290> the<00:03:25.290> demographic<00:03:26.100> of<00:03:26.220> the

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:26.340 
expanding the demographic of the

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.160 
expanding the demographic of the
PlayStation<00:03:26.880> 3<00:03:27.180> can<00:03:27.420> you<00:03:27.510> address<00:03:27.690> that<00:03:27.810> with

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:28.170 
PlayStation 3 can you address that with

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.530 
PlayStation 3 can you address that with
this<00:03:28.290> technology<00:03:28.790> right<00:03:29.790> so<00:03:30.060> with

00:03:30.530 --> 00:03:30.540 
this technology right so with

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:33.830 
this technology right so with
PlayStation<00:03:31.049> 3<00:03:31.260> we<00:03:31.560> have<00:03:32.390> we<00:03:33.390> think<00:03:33.600> that<00:03:33.660> the

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:33.840 
PlayStation 3 we have we think that the

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.660 
PlayStation 3 we have we think that the
PlayStation<00:03:34.380> Move<00:03:34.560> will<00:03:34.920> expand<00:03:35.459> our

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:35.670 
PlayStation Move will expand our

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:38.210 
PlayStation Move will expand our
audience<00:03:36.090> however<00:03:36.620> we<00:03:37.620> don't<00:03:37.739> want<00:03:37.980> to<00:03:38.100> just

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:38.220 
audience however we don't want to just

00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:40.130 
audience however we don't want to just
just<00:03:38.640> add<00:03:38.850> some<00:03:38.880> casual<00:03:39.540> gamers<00:03:39.870> to<00:03:40.019> our

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:40.140 
just add some casual gamers to our

00:03:40.140 --> 00:03:41.690 
just add some casual gamers to our
platform<00:03:40.530> messing<00:03:40.799> up<00:03:40.859> the<00:03:40.950> goal<00:03:41.100> of<00:03:41.220> this<00:03:41.310> the

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:41.700 
platform messing up the goal of this the

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.580 
platform messing up the goal of this the
goal<00:03:41.910> of<00:03:42.030> this<00:03:42.150> is<00:03:42.359> to<00:03:42.420> make<00:03:42.780> a<00:03:42.840> device<00:03:43.260> which

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
goal of this is to make a device which

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:44.990 
goal of this is to make a device which
can<00:03:43.739> reach<00:03:43.950> out<00:03:44.160> through<00:03:44.489> the<00:03:44.640> widest

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:45.000 
can reach out through the widest

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.720 
can reach out through the widest
possible<00:03:45.209> audience<00:03:45.630> not<00:03:46.560> only<00:03:46.799> casual<00:03:47.370> people

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:47.730 
possible audience not only casual people

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:49.910 
possible audience not only casual people
but<00:03:48.060> already<00:03:48.390> are<00:03:48.690> existing

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:49.920 
but already are existing

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.040 
but already are existing
customers<00:03:50.490> so<00:03:50.730> we<00:03:51.090> think<00:03:51.360> this<00:03:51.510> device<00:03:51.840> will

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:52.050 
customers so we think this device will

00:03:52.050 --> 00:03:54.589 
customers so we think this device will
be<00:03:52.080> good<00:03:52.349> for<00:03:52.700> people<00:03:53.700> who<00:03:53.940> already<00:03:53.970> have<00:03:54.330> the

00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:54.599 
be good for people who already have the

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:56.600 
be good for people who already have the
playstation<00:03:54.840> 3<00:03:55.349> and<00:03:55.500> it<00:03:56.099> will<00:03:56.190> bring<00:03:56.280> in<00:03:56.459> a<00:03:56.520> new

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:56.610 
playstation 3 and it will bring in a new

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:58.309 
playstation 3 and it will bring in a new
set<00:03:56.819> of<00:03:56.910> people<00:03:57.120> so<00:03:57.420> that's<00:03:57.569> really<00:03:57.870> excited

00:03:58.309 --> 00:03:58.319 
set of people so that's really excited

00:03:58.319 --> 00:03:59.900 
set of people so that's really excited
about<00:03:58.410> that<00:03:58.650> part<00:03:58.920> of<00:03:58.980> it<00:03:59.099> one<00:03:59.760> of<00:03:59.849> the

00:03:59.900 --> 00:03:59.910 
about that part of it one of the

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:01.520 
about that part of it one of the
challenges<00:03:59.940> of<00:04:00.599> creating<00:04:00.750> something<00:04:01.380> that

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:01.530 
challenges of creating something that

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.830 
challenges of creating something that
you<00:04:01.830> can<00:04:01.980> have<00:04:02.160> motion<00:04:02.459> with<00:04:02.849> but<00:04:03.480> yet<00:04:03.660> that

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:03.840 
you can have motion with but yet that

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:05.330 
you can have motion with but yet that
you<00:04:04.050> can<00:04:04.260> play<00:04:04.440> for<00:04:04.620> an<00:04:04.709> extended<00:04:05.069> period<00:04:05.099> of

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
you can play for an extended period of

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:06.920 
you can play for an extended period of
time<00:04:05.430> without<00:04:05.730> completely<00:04:06.390> getting<00:04:06.720> tired

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930 
time without completely getting tired

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:09.170 
time without completely getting tired
well<00:04:07.680> that<00:04:08.190> was<00:04:08.340> one<00:04:08.489> of<00:04:08.580> the<00:04:08.670> challenges<00:04:09.060> we

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:09.180 
well that was one of the challenges we

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.000 
well that was one of the challenges we
faced<00:04:09.360> with<00:04:09.510> I<00:04:09.630> toy<00:04:09.840> is<00:04:10.020> that<00:04:10.200> it's<00:04:10.500> great<00:04:10.770> from

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010 
faced with I toy is that it's great from

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:12.590 
faced with I toy is that it's great from
an<00:04:11.100> exercise<00:04:11.520> point<00:04:11.760> of<00:04:11.850> view<00:04:11.940> so<00:04:12.120> that's<00:04:12.300> good

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:12.600 
an exercise point of view so that's good

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.620 
an exercise point of view so that's good
but<00:04:13.020> they're<00:04:13.200> cut<00:04:13.950> it<00:04:14.069> was<00:04:14.190> a<00:04:14.220> limit<00:04:14.580> about<00:04:14.880> of

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:15.630 
but they're cut it was a limit about of

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:16.789 
but they're cut it was a limit about of
experience<00:04:16.139> you<00:04:16.200> wanted<00:04:16.440> to<00:04:16.530> do<00:04:16.620> with<00:04:16.739> it

00:04:16.789 --> 00:04:16.799 
experience you wanted to do with it

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:18.680 
experience you wanted to do with it
because<00:04:16.889> you<00:04:17.010> got<00:04:17.160> tired<00:04:17.400> however<00:04:18.180> since<00:04:18.480> we

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:18.690 
because you got tired however since we

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:20.030 
because you got tired however since we
do<00:04:18.840> have<00:04:18.989> such<00:04:19.200> fine<00:04:19.410> control<00:04:19.739> you<00:04:19.889> can

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:20.040 
do have such fine control you can

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:21.710 
do have such fine control you can
actually<00:04:20.220> just<00:04:20.579> move<00:04:20.850> just<00:04:21.090> subtle<00:04:21.419> motions

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:21.720 
actually just move just subtle motions

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.210 
actually just move just subtle motions
of<00:04:21.840> your<00:04:21.989> wrist<00:04:22.200> for<00:04:22.470> a<00:04:22.530> long<00:04:22.710> time<00:04:22.919> with<00:04:23.130> this

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:23.220 
of your wrist for a long time with this

00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.580 
of your wrist for a long time with this
game<00:04:23.460> and<00:04:23.700> and<00:04:24.330> have<00:04:24.720> a<00:04:24.750> really<00:04:25.050> good<00:04:25.200> kind<00:04:25.500> of

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590 
game and and have a really good kind of

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:27.140 
game and and have a really good kind of
maybe<00:04:25.710> first<00:04:26.040> person<00:04:26.310> shooter<00:04:26.550> experience<00:04:27.030> or

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:27.150 
maybe first person shooter experience or

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:29.000 
maybe first person shooter experience or
something<00:04:27.389> like<00:04:27.479> that<00:04:27.540> so<00:04:27.840> this<00:04:28.380> one<00:04:28.590> doesn't

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:29.010 
something like that so this one doesn't

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:31.550 
something like that so this one doesn't
require<00:04:29.310> you<00:04:29.700> to<00:04:29.940> be<00:04:29.970> super<00:04:30.389> physical<00:04:30.810> but<00:04:31.320> it

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:31.560 
require you to be super physical but it

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.830 
require you to be super physical but it
can<00:04:32.220> enable<00:04:32.790> that<00:04:32.910> if<00:04:33.060> you<00:04:33.150> want<00:04:33.300> it<00:04:33.389> to<00:04:33.570> so

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:33.840 
can enable that if you want it to so

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.860 
can enable that if you want it to so
kind<00:04:34.229> of<00:04:34.350> both<00:04:34.530> spectrum<00:04:35.490> available<00:04:35.870> was

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:36.870 
kind of both spectrum available was

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:38.030 
kind of both spectrum available was
there<00:04:37.020> anything<00:04:37.229> you<00:04:37.380> learned<00:04:37.530> in

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:38.040 
there anything you learned in

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:39.710 
there anything you learned in
researching<00:04:38.639> and<00:04:38.760> creating<00:04:39.030> this<00:04:39.120> technology

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:39.720 
researching and creating this technology

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.500 
researching and creating this technology
that<00:04:40.280> we've<00:04:41.280> seen<00:04:41.490> in<00:04:41.520> the<00:04:41.669> past<00:04:41.729> from<00:04:42.300> what

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:42.510 
that we've seen in the past from what

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:45.409 
that we've seen in the past from what
the<00:04:42.750> Nintendo<00:04:43.290> and<00:04:43.470> we<00:04:43.620> has<00:04:43.889> done<00:04:44.100> I<00:04:44.419> think

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:45.419 
the Nintendo and we has done I think

00:04:45.419 --> 00:04:47.360 
the Nintendo and we has done I think
what<00:04:45.630> Nintendo<00:04:46.080> and<00:04:46.410> the<00:04:46.710> wii<00:04:46.830> i<00:04:47.040> think<00:04:47.280> that

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:47.370 
what Nintendo and the wii i think that

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:49.159 
what Nintendo and the wii i think that
was<00:04:47.490> a<00:04:47.520> great<00:04:47.669> step<00:04:48.240> for<00:04:48.450> our<00:04:48.479> industry<00:04:48.780> i<00:04:48.990> was

00:04:49.159 --> 00:04:49.169 
was a great step for our industry i was

00:04:49.169 --> 00:04:51.710 
was a great step for our industry i was
really<00:04:49.350> excited<00:04:49.770> to<00:04:50.160> by<00:04:50.280> that<00:04:50.460> i<00:04:50.490> mean<00:04:50.700> i<00:04:50.910> think

00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:51.720 
really excited to by that i mean i think

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.170 
really excited to by that i mean i think
that<00:04:52.229> we<00:04:52.740> learned<00:04:53.040> from<00:04:53.160> what<00:04:53.430> they<00:04:53.580> did<00:04:53.820> and<00:04:54.060> i

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:54.180 
that we learned from what they did and i

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:55.279 
that we learned from what they did and i
think<00:04:54.390> they<00:04:54.479> learned<00:04:54.630> a<00:04:54.810> little<00:04:54.960> bit<00:04:55.080> from

00:04:55.279 --> 00:04:55.289 
think they learned a little bit from

00:04:55.289 --> 00:04:56.840 
think they learned a little bit from
what<00:04:55.320> we<00:04:55.500> did<00:04:55.650> with<00:04:55.770> I<00:04:55.860> toy<00:04:56.039> before<00:04:56.250> that<00:04:56.610> I

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:56.850 
what we did with I toy before that I

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:58.940 
what we did with I toy before that I
think<00:04:57.240> all<00:04:57.419> of<00:04:57.450> the<00:04:57.630> different<00:04:57.990> people<00:04:58.800> in<00:04:58.890> the

00:04:58.940 --> 00:04:58.950 
think all of the different people in the

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:00.110 
think all of the different people in the
industry<00:04:59.039> learn<00:04:59.400> from<00:04:59.550> each<00:04:59.640> other<00:04:59.820> that<00:05:00.000> way

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:00.120 
industry learn from each other that way

00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:01.640 
industry learn from each other that way
what<00:05:00.570> we<00:05:00.660> try<00:05:00.810> to<00:05:00.840> do<00:05:01.020> with<00:05:01.140> this<00:05:01.260> controller

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:01.650 
what we try to do with this controller

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:03.350 
what we try to do with this controller
is<00:05:01.740> take<00:05:01.950> everything<00:05:02.400> that<00:05:02.610> was<00:05:02.850> happened<00:05:03.240> so

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:03.360 
is take everything that was happened so

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.010 
is take everything that was happened so
far<00:05:03.600> and<00:05:03.900> make<00:05:04.410> the<00:05:04.530> best<00:05:04.680> thing<00:05:04.860> we<00:05:04.950> could

00:05:06.010 --> 00:05:06.020 
far and make the best thing we could

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:08.180 
far and make the best thing we could
what<00:05:07.020> are<00:05:07.080> your<00:05:07.200> thoughts<00:05:07.320> about<00:05:07.470> the<00:05:07.950> whole

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:08.190 
what are your thoughts about the whole

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:09.650 
what are your thoughts about the whole
industry<00:05:08.370> going<00:05:08.760> this<00:05:08.970> direction<00:05:09.120> because<00:05:09.510> in

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:09.660 
industry going this direction because in

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:11.659 
industry going this direction because in
addition<00:05:09.780> to<00:05:10.110> move<00:05:11.010> we're<00:05:11.280> also<00:05:11.400> going<00:05:11.610> to

00:05:11.659 --> 00:05:11.669 
addition to move we're also going to

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:16.000 
addition to move we're also going to
have<00:05:11.820> project<00:05:12.300> natal<00:05:12.600> adding<00:05:13.050> to<00:05:13.830> the<00:05:14.010> mix<00:05:14.660> so

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:16.010 
have project natal adding to the mix so

00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:18.710 
have project natal adding to the mix so
obviously<00:05:17.010> from<00:05:17.640> all<00:05:17.910> this<00:05:18.060> action<00:05:18.300> in<00:05:18.570> this

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:18.720 
obviously from all this action in this

00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:20.870 
obviously from all this action in this
space<00:05:18.930> you<00:05:19.169> can<00:05:19.289> see<00:05:19.470> that<00:05:19.500> the<00:05:19.710> interface<00:05:20.640> to

00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:20.880 
space you can see that the interface to

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:22.730 
space you can see that the interface to
the<00:05:21.000> player<00:05:21.240> is<00:05:21.479> really<00:05:21.870> important<00:05:22.320> thing<00:05:22.500> for

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:22.740 
the player is really important thing for

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:25.880 
the player is really important thing for
future<00:05:23.640> of<00:05:23.729> games<00:05:23.970> it<00:05:24.539> that's<00:05:25.229> where<00:05:25.530> right

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:25.890 
future of games it that's where right

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:28.070 
future of games it that's where right
now<00:05:25.919> the<00:05:26.100> most<00:05:26.430> innovation<00:05:26.789> is<00:05:27.030> happening<00:05:27.080> the

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:28.080 
now the most innovation is happening the

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:30.560 
now the most innovation is happening the
graphics<00:05:28.350> people<00:05:28.890> have<00:05:29.160> gotten<00:05:29.940> to<00:05:30.150> a<00:05:30.180> little

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:30.570 
graphics people have gotten to a little

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:31.880 
graphics people have gotten to a little
bit<00:05:30.660> more<00:05:30.810> mature<00:05:30.930> level<00:05:31.320> so<00:05:31.560> they<00:05:31.650> can<00:05:31.770> make

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:31.890 
bit more mature level so they can make

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:35.770 
bit more mature level so they can make
just<00:05:32.039> amazing<00:05:32.580> graphics<00:05:33.060> on<00:05:33.240> on<00:05:34.229> our<00:05:34.470> platform

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:35.780 
just amazing graphics on on our platform

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:37.540 
just amazing graphics on on our platform
so<00:05:35.930> now<00:05:36.380> some<00:05:36.860> of<00:05:36.980> the<00:05:37.040> space<00:05:37.250> is<00:05:37.430> being

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:37.550 
so now some of the space is being

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:39.310 
so now some of the space is being
explored<00:05:37.730> more<00:05:38.180> are<00:05:38.510> the<00:05:38.780> way<00:05:38.870> people

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:39.320 
explored more are the way people

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:41.680 
explored more are the way people
interact<00:05:39.680> with<00:05:40.460> the<00:05:40.580> system<00:05:40.760> and<00:05:41.210> I<00:05:41.480> think

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:41.690 
interact with the system and I think

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:43.150 
interact with the system and I think
that<00:05:41.840> will<00:05:41.930> continue<00:05:41.990> to<00:05:42.440> happen<00:05:42.590> over<00:05:43.040> the

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:43.160 
that will continue to happen over the

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:44.890 
that will continue to happen over the
next<00:05:43.190> few<00:05:43.550> years<00:05:43.610> you'll<00:05:44.000> see<00:05:44.240> that<00:05:44.450> space

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:44.900 
next few years you'll see that space

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:47.680 
next few years you'll see that space
