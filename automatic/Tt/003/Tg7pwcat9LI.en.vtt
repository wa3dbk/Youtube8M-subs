the<00:04:32.470> time<00:04:32.500> he<00:04:32.919> has<00:04:33.100> the<00:04:33.340> son<00:04:33.610> over<00:04:33.790> here<00:04:34.240> and

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:35.100 
the time he has the son over here and

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:39.080 
the time he has the son over here and
then<00:04:36.150> so<00:04:37.150> I<00:04:37.240> think<00:04:37.360> at<00:04:37.690> one<00:04:37.900> degree<00:04:38.080> and<00:04:38.470> then

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090 
then so I think at one degree and then

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:43.800 
then so I think at one degree and then
mercury<00:04:40.860> may<00:04:41.860> be<00:04:42.090> roughly<00:04:43.090> up<00:04:43.210> very<00:04:43.479> close<00:04:43.660> to

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:43.810 
mercury may be roughly up very close to

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:51.439 
mercury may be roughly up very close to
10<00:04:43.990> degrees<00:04:44.020> and<00:04:44.560> then<00:04:45.250> we<00:04:45.610> have<00:04:47.850> Saturn<00:04:49.680> and

00:04:51.439 --> 00:04:51.449 
10 degrees and then we have Saturn and

00:04:51.449 --> 00:04:56.700 
10 degrees and then we have Saturn and
Venus<00:04:54.120> Venus<00:04:55.120> is<00:04:55.419> very<00:04:55.630> far<00:04:55.930> away<00:04:55.960> from<00:04:56.440> the

00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:56.710 
Venus Venus is very far away from the

00:04:56.710 --> 00:05:00.450 
Venus Venus is very far away from the
Sun<00:04:57.070> and<00:04:57.660> given<00:04:58.660> these<00:04:59.620> two<00:04:59.830> are<00:04:59.919> closer<00:05:00.220> to

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:00.460 
Sun and given these two are closer to

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:02.719 
Sun and given these two are closer to
each<00:05:00.490> other<00:05:00.760> then<00:05:01.330> we<00:05:01.360> have<00:05:01.690> this<00:05:02.350> is<00:05:02.530> the

00:05:02.719 --> 00:05:02.729 
each other then we have this is the

00:05:02.729 --> 00:05:06.719 
each other then we have this is the
tenth<00:05:03.729> house<00:05:04.350> okay<00:05:05.350> and<00:05:05.590> this<00:05:06.190> is<00:05:06.250> the<00:05:06.400> ninth

00:05:06.719 --> 00:05:06.729 
tenth house okay and this is the ninth

00:05:06.729 --> 00:05:07.260 
tenth house okay and this is the ninth
house

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:07.270 
house

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:13.170

we<00:05:07.690> have<00:05:08.460> Jupiter<00:05:09.460> we<00:05:10.210> have<00:05:11.910> Mahaprabhu<00:05:12.910> in

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:13.180 
we have Jupiter we have Mahaprabhu in

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:18.330 
we have Jupiter we have Mahaprabhu in
the<00:05:13.389> eighth<00:05:13.950> we<00:05:14.950> have<00:05:15.389> Cato<00:05:16.389> in<00:05:16.600> the<00:05:16.690> second<00:05:17.340> so

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:18.340 
the eighth we have Cato in the second so

00:05:18.340 --> 00:05:21.450 
the eighth we have Cato in the second so
one<00:05:18.580> two<00:05:19.000> three<00:05:19.030> four<00:05:19.930> five<00:05:20.289> six<00:05:20.680> seven<00:05:21.039> eight

nine nine grahas are being filled so

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:28.640 
nine nine grahas are being filled so
this<00:05:25.720> is<00:05:25.990> the<00:05:26.229> first<00:05:26.650> book<00:05:26.919> of<00:05:27.600> Albert

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:34.810 
wordpress.com had made a comment where I

00:05:34.810 --> 00:05:36.480 
wordpress.com had made a comment where I
had<00:05:35.020> discussed<00:05:35.440> about<00:05:35.590> the<00:05:35.889> conversion<00:05:36.220> of

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:36.490 
had discussed about the conversion of

00:05:36.490 --> 00:05:40.560 
had discussed about the conversion of
planets<00:05:37.000> when<00:05:37.690> once<00:05:38.169> it<00:05:38.530> close<00:05:39.190> to<00:05:39.340> the<00:05:39.460> Sun<00:05:39.700> he

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:40.570 
planets when once it close to the Sun he

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:43.080 
planets when once it close to the Sun he
had<00:05:40.780> written<00:05:41.169> to<00:05:41.349> me<00:05:41.590> saying<00:05:41.830> that<00:05:42.130> Albert

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:43.090 
had written to me saying that Albert

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:44.969 
had written to me saying that Albert
Einstein<00:05:43.479> source<00:05:43.720> book<00:05:43.930> shows<00:05:44.260> that<00:05:44.530> all<00:05:44.770> the

00:05:44.969 --> 00:05:44.979 
Einstein source book shows that all the

00:05:44.979 --> 00:05:49.020 
Einstein source book shows that all the
three<00:05:45.639> jaha's<00:05:46.240> are<00:05:46.419> combust<00:05:46.840> and<00:05:48.030> despite

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:49.030 
three jaha's are combust and despite

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:51.900 
three jaha's are combust and despite
that<00:05:49.210> he<00:05:49.419> made<00:05:49.599> it<00:05:49.720> big<00:05:49.960> whenever<00:05:50.889> you<00:05:51.220> see<00:05:51.669> a

00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:51.910 
that he made it big whenever you see a

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:54.629 
that he made it big whenever you see a
group<00:05:52.210> of<00:05:52.419> plants<00:05:52.720> like<00:05:52.990> this<00:05:53.169> always<00:05:53.740> check

00:05:54.629 --> 00:05:54.639 
group of plants like this always check

00:05:54.639 --> 00:05:56.820 
group of plants like this always check
out<00:05:54.820> the<00:05:55.000> degrees<00:05:55.360> length<00:05:55.660> here<00:05:56.050> dissolve<00:05:56.530> one

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:56.830 
out the degrees length here dissolve one

00:05:56.830 --> 00:05:59.330 
out the degrees length here dissolve one
degree<00:05:57.190> and<00:05:57.370> Mercury<00:05:57.760> 1012<00:05:58.450> Saturn<00:05:58.900> and<00:05:59.050> Venus

telephone<00:06:00.340> so<00:06:01.030> you<00:06:01.450> will<00:06:01.599> find<00:06:01.900> that<00:06:02.289> the<00:06:02.500> Sun

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:02.770 
telephone so you will find that the Sun

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:06.089 
telephone so you will find that the Sun
is<00:06:03.180> not<00:06:04.180> very<00:06:04.840> close<00:06:05.110> to<00:06:05.349> any<00:06:05.530> of<00:06:05.560> these<00:06:05.830> three

00:06:06.089 --> 00:06:06.099 
is not very close to any of these three

00:06:06.099 --> 00:06:08.430 
is not very close to any of these three
and<00:06:06.400> that<00:06:07.330> is<00:06:07.419> the<00:06:07.510> reason<00:06:07.660> why<00:06:07.990> he<00:06:08.200> does<00:06:08.410> not

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:08.440 
and that is the reason why he does not

00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:09.690 
and that is the reason why he does not
really<00:06:08.860> have<00:06:09.070> flipped

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:09.700 
really have flipped

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:11.370 
really have flipped
the<00:06:09.790> Sun<00:06:10.000> because<00:06:10.360> under<00:06:10.750> the<00:06:10.900> border<00:06:11.230> of

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:11.380 
the Sun because under the border of

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:13.950 
the Sun because under the border of
these<00:06:12.040> two<00:06:12.220> signs<00:06:12.460> so<00:06:13.390> the<00:06:13.510> first<00:06:13.720> thing<00:06:13.930> that

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:13.960 
these two signs so the first thing that

00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:18.600 
these two signs so the first thing that
strikes<00:06:14.800> the<00:06:14.980> eye<00:06:15.070> here<00:06:15.550> is<00:06:15.990> the<00:06:17.280> law<00:06:18.280> of<00:06:18.310> the

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:18.610 
strikes the eye here is the law of the

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:21.750 
strikes the eye here is the law of the
ninth<00:06:18.870> which<00:06:19.870> is<00:06:20.050> Saturn<00:06:20.620> the<00:06:21.190> corner<00:06:21.460> of<00:06:21.580> this

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:21.760 
ninth which is Saturn the corner of this

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:24.350 
ninth which is Saturn the corner of this
end<00:06:21.970> Saturn<00:06:22.450> and<00:06:22.600> the<00:06:22.720> owner<00:06:22.930> of<00:06:23.110> this<00:06:23.290> side<00:06:23.560> is

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:24.360 
end Saturn and the owner of this side is
