and three-quarters mark a score line
there<00:02:29.829> and<00:02:30.159> then<00:02:31.000> that's<00:02:31.540> all<00:02:31.719> you<00:02:31.840> need

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:31.989 
there and then that's all you need

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:34.559 
there and then that's all you need
you're<00:02:32.139> simply<00:02:32.469> scored<00:02:32.799> tool<00:02:32.859> for<00:02:33.359> move<00:02:34.359> that

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:34.569 
you're simply scored tool for move that

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:39.020 
you're simply scored tool for move that
out<00:02:34.750> of<00:02:34.870> the<00:02:34.930> way<00:02:36.750> and<00:02:37.750> then<00:02:37.959> the<00:02:38.079> assembly

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030 
out of the way and then the assembly

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.080 
out of the way and then the assembly
it's<00:02:40.030> very<00:02:40.629> very<00:02:41.049> easy<00:02:41.170> so<00:02:41.889> the<00:02:42.669> first<00:02:42.909> thing

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:43.090 
it's very very easy so the first thing

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:44.750 
it's very very easy so the first thing
you're<00:02:43.239> going<00:02:43.359> to<00:02:43.419> do<00:02:43.629> is<00:02:43.840> open<00:02:44.079> it<00:02:44.260> up<00:02:44.470> and

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:44.760 
you're going to do is open it up and

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.429 
you're going to do is open it up and
you're<00:02:45.760> going<00:02:45.819> to<00:02:45.909> fold<00:02:46.239> into<00:02:46.750> the<00:02:47.049> center

00:02:47.429 --> 00:02:47.439 
you're going to fold into the center

00:02:47.439 --> 00:02:50.399 
you're going to fold into the center
both<00:02:48.400> sides<00:02:48.760> and<00:02:49.510> it<00:02:49.599> doesn't<00:02:49.930> matter<00:02:50.049> if<00:02:50.169> you

00:02:50.399 --> 00:02:50.409 
both sides and it doesn't matter if you

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:55.679 
both sides and it doesn't matter if you
do<00:02:51.209> one<00:02:52.209> over<00:02:52.450> the<00:02:52.540> other<00:02:52.689> it's<00:02:52.900> just<00:02:53.790> and<00:02:54.790> and

00:02:55.679 --> 00:02:55.689 
do one over the other it's just and and

00:02:55.689 --> 00:02:57.659 
do one over the other it's just and and
I'm<00:02:56.139> folding<00:02:56.379> it<00:02:56.590> this<00:02:56.739> way<00:02:56.919> because<00:02:57.129> I<00:02:57.310> want

00:02:57.659 --> 00:02:57.669 
I'm folding it this way because I want

00:02:57.669 --> 00:03:01.920 
I'm folding it this way because I want
this<00:02:58.319> mosaic<00:02:59.549> to<00:03:00.549> be<00:03:00.669> the<00:03:00.849> outer<00:03:01.000> portion<00:03:01.840> of

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:01.930 
this mosaic to be the outer portion of

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.080 
this mosaic to be the outer portion of
it<00:03:02.109> if<00:03:02.260> you<00:03:02.709> want<00:03:02.859> the<00:03:03.069> birds<00:03:03.280> to<00:03:03.519> be<00:03:03.700> the<00:03:03.939> outer

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:04.090 
it if you want the birds to be the outer

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:06.300 
it if you want the birds to be the outer
portion<00:03:04.629> you<00:03:05.169> just<00:03:05.379> fold<00:03:05.590> it<00:03:05.739> the<00:03:05.859> opposite

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:06.310 
portion you just fold it the opposite

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:07.500 
portion you just fold it the opposite
way<00:03:06.430> and<00:03:06.579> it<00:03:06.669> really<00:03:06.819> doesn't<00:03:07.060> matter<00:03:07.269> the

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:07.510 
way and it really doesn't matter the

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:09.349 
way and it really doesn't matter the
score<00:03:07.810> lines<00:03:07.989> will<00:03:08.230> work<00:03:08.409> either<00:03:08.650> way

00:03:09.349 --> 00:03:09.359 
score lines will work either way

00:03:09.359 --> 00:03:11.640 
score lines will work either way
then<00:03:10.359> the<00:03:10.689> next<00:03:10.930> thing<00:03:11.079> you're<00:03:11.230> going<00:03:11.409> to<00:03:11.500> do

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:11.650 
then the next thing you're going to do

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:12.839 
then the next thing you're going to do
I'm<00:03:11.769> going<00:03:11.859> to<00:03:11.919> flip<00:03:12.099> it<00:03:12.129> back<00:03:12.370> because<00:03:12.489> I<00:03:12.669> went

00:03:12.839 --> 00:03:12.849 
I'm going to flip it back because I went

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:16.229 
I'm going to flip it back because I went
this<00:03:13.030> way<00:03:13.180> and<00:03:13.620> you<00:03:14.620> have<00:03:14.829> this<00:03:15.099> middle<00:03:15.760> line

00:03:16.229 --> 00:03:16.239 
this way and you have this middle line

00:03:16.239 --> 00:03:18.420 
this way and you have this middle line
is<00:03:16.269> from<00:03:16.720> where<00:03:16.900> we<00:03:17.049> folded<00:03:17.500> it<00:03:17.650> in<00:03:17.739> half<00:03:17.769> and

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:18.430 
is from where we folded it in half and

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:20.939 
is from where we folded it in half and
then<00:03:18.489> this<00:03:19.180> is<00:03:19.389> the<00:03:19.599> score<00:03:19.959> line<00:03:20.169> that<00:03:20.709> we<00:03:20.799> did

00:03:20.939 --> 00:03:20.949 
then this is the score line that we did

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:23.699 
then this is the score line that we did
at<00:03:21.220> a<00:03:21.250> half<00:03:21.519> inch<00:03:21.729> and<00:03:22.030> a<00:03:22.150> half<00:03:22.329> inch<00:03:22.599> and<00:03:22.870> so<00:03:23.590> at

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:23.709 
at a half inch and a half inch and so at

00:03:23.709 --> 00:03:24.929 
at a half inch and a half inch and so at
this<00:03:23.829> point<00:03:24.129> you're<00:03:24.220> going<00:03:24.340> to<00:03:24.400> flip<00:03:24.639> it<00:03:24.790> over

00:03:24.929 --> 00:03:24.939 
this point you're going to flip it over

00:03:24.939 --> 00:03:29.099 
this point you're going to flip it over
and<00:03:26.340> get<00:03:27.340> a<00:03:27.370> crease<00:03:27.699> on<00:03:27.909> the<00:03:28.000> half<00:03:28.389> inch<00:03:28.659> score

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:29.109 
and get a crease on the half inch score

00:03:29.109 --> 00:03:31.610 
and get a crease on the half inch score
line<00:03:29.290> and<00:03:29.530> then<00:03:30.010> the<00:03:30.280> half<00:03:30.459> inch<00:03:30.699> score<00:03:31.090> line

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:31.620 
line and then the half inch score line

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:35.099 
line and then the half inch score line
so<00:03:32.620> you<00:03:32.739> can<00:03:32.889> still<00:03:33.220> probably<00:03:34.150> hard<00:03:34.629> to<00:03:34.930> pick

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:35.109 
so you can still probably hard to pick

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:37.710 
so you can still probably hard to pick
up<00:03:35.260> but<00:03:35.409> you<00:03:35.500> can<00:03:35.620> still<00:03:35.829> see<00:03:36.419> that's<00:03:37.419> the

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:37.720 
up but you can still see that's the

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.689 
up but you can still see that's the
center<00:03:38.079> score<00:03:38.829> and<00:03:39.099> then<00:03:39.280> these<00:03:39.400> are<00:03:39.459> the<00:03:39.609> two

00:03:39.689 --> 00:03:39.699 
center score and then these are the two

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:42.719 
center score and then these are the two
half-inch<00:03:40.239> and<00:03:40.889> what<00:03:41.889> we<00:03:42.009> want<00:03:42.280> are<00:03:42.430> the<00:03:42.549> two

00:03:42.719 --> 00:03:42.729 
half-inch and what we want are the two

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:47.369 
half-inch and what we want are the two
half-inch<00:03:43.239> and<00:03:44.549> look<00:03:45.549> as<00:03:45.759> easy<00:03:46.239> as<00:03:46.599> that<00:03:46.750> you

00:03:47.369 --> 00:03:47.379 
half-inch and look as easy as that you

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:50.699 
half-inch and look as easy as that you
have<00:03:48.069> your<00:03:48.879> tea<00:03:49.239> bag<00:03:49.419> holder<00:03:49.870> you're<00:03:50.500> going<00:03:50.620> to

00:03:50.699 --> 00:03:50.709 
have your tea bag holder you're going to

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:52.649 
have your tea bag holder you're going to
want<00:03:50.889> to<00:03:50.919> punch<00:03:51.579> a<00:03:51.699> hole<00:03:51.729> right<00:03:52.090> here<00:03:52.150> and

00:03:52.649 --> 00:03:52.659 
want to punch a hole right here and

00:03:52.659 --> 00:03:55.640 
want to punch a hole right here and
attach<00:03:52.959> some<00:03:52.989> ribbon<00:03:53.319> like<00:03:53.799> I've<00:03:54.009> done<00:03:54.250> and

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:55.650 
attach some ribbon like I've done and

00:03:55.650 --> 00:03:58.050 
attach some ribbon like I've done and
then<00:03:56.650> you<00:03:56.799> can<00:03:56.829> just<00:03:57.129> embellish<00:03:57.609> the<00:03:57.790> front

00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.060 
then you can just embellish the front

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:01.589 
then you can just embellish the front
and<00:03:58.359> all<00:03:59.109> I<00:03:59.139> did<00:03:59.319> is<00:03:59.650> I<00:03:59.769> used<00:04:00.159> a<00:04:00.389> scallop<00:04:01.389> circle
