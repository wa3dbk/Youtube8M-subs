00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:50.050 
if we have to walking through what I

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:52.110 
if we have to walking through what I
call<00:00:50.140> the<00:00:50.530> 10<00:00:50.739> C's<00:00:51.010> of<00:00:51.040> survivability<00:00:51.550> we<00:00:51.970> have

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:52.120 
call the 10 C's of survivability we have

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.350 
call the 10 C's of survivability we have
used<00:00:52.390> quite<00:00:52.960> a<00:00:53.079> few<00:00:53.320> of<00:00:53.379> these<00:00:53.469> 10<00:00:53.739> C's<00:00:54.149> just<00:00:55.149> in

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:55.360 
used quite a few of these 10 C's just in

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:56.850 
used quite a few of these 10 C's just in
what<00:00:55.750> we've<00:00:55.899> done<00:00:56.079> so<00:00:56.350> far

tendencies of survivability we need

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:23.460

second five seasons of survivability

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:51.670 
second five seasons of survivability
we've<00:02:50.120> talked<00:02:50.390> about<00:02:50.510> our<00:02:50.660> bandana<00:02:51.350> a<00:02:51.440> little

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.680 
we've talked about our bandana a little

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.740 
we've talked about our bandana a little
bit<00:02:51.800> and<00:02:52.280> what<00:02:52.370> we<00:02:52.490> can<00:02:52.700> do<00:02:52.820> with<00:02:52.940> that<00:02:53.150> we<00:02:53.600> can

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:53.750 
bit and what we can do with that we can

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.320 
bit and what we can do with that we can
use<00:02:53.900> that<00:02:53.930> for<00:02:54.820> carrying<00:02:55.820> things<00:02:55.970> we<00:02:56.180> can<00:02:56.300> use

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.330 
use that for carrying things we can use

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:57.640 
use that for carrying things we can use
it<00:02:56.510> for<00:02:56.540> hygiene<00:02:57.020> we<00:02:57.230> can<00:02:57.350> use<00:02:57.470> it<00:02:57.560> for

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:57.650 
it for hygiene we can use it for

00:02:57.650 --> 00:02:59.770 
it for hygiene we can use it for
signaling<00:02:58.100> we<00:02:58.670> can<00:02:58.820> use<00:02:58.940> to<00:02:59.090> make<00:02:59.180> char<00:02:59.450> cloth

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 
signaling we can use to make char cloth

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.230 
signaling we can use to make char cloth
so<00:03:00.740> it's<00:03:00.890> a<00:03:00.950> very<00:03:01.070> multifunctional<00:03:01.880> item<00:03:02.120> that

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:02.240 
so it's a very multifunctional item that

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:04.930 
so it's a very multifunctional item that
we<00:03:02.330> can<00:03:02.450> carry<00:03:02.740> the<00:03:03.740> second<00:03:04.160> five<00:03:04.310> seater<00:03:04.670> that

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:04.940 
we can carry the second five seater that

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.350 
we can carry the second five seater that
number<00:03:05.750> seven<00:03:06.080> 5c<00:03:06.590> would<00:03:07.250> be<00:03:07.460> cargo<00:03:07.970> tape<00:03:08.180> I

number seven 5c would be cargo tape I

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.300 
number seven 5c would be cargo tape I
would<00:03:08.420> suggest<00:03:08.660> a<00:03:08.930> two<00:03:09.110> inch<00:03:09.320> roll<00:03:09.560> in<00:03:09.770> a<00:03:10.130> whole

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:10.310 
would suggest a two inch roll in a whole

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.490 
would suggest a two inch roll in a whole
roll<00:03:10.520> if<00:03:10.640> you<00:03:10.730> can<00:03:10.880> carry<00:03:11.120> it<00:03:11.330> gorilla<00:03:11.990> tape<00:03:12.260> is

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:24.830 
out of duct tape in an emergency if you

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:26.710 
out of duct tape in an emergency if you
have<00:03:24.980> enough<00:03:25.220> of<00:03:25.430> it<00:03:25.580> including<00:03:25.760> a<00:03:26.330> container

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:26.720 
have enough of it including a container

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.440 
have enough of it including a container
if<00:03:26.870> you<00:03:26.990> had<00:03:27.140> to<00:03:27.520> we<00:03:28.520> had<00:03:28.550> a<00:03:28.700> candling<00:03:29.180> device

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450 
if you had to we had a candling device

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:31.510 
if you had to we had a candling device
which<00:03:29.840> again<00:03:30.350> has<00:03:30.560> to<00:03:30.650> be<00:03:30.710> multifunctional

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:31.520 
which again has to be multifunctional

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:33.400 
which again has to be multifunctional
because<00:03:31.820> it<00:03:31.940> has<00:03:32.060> to<00:03:32.150> have<00:03:32.240> flash<00:03:32.510> mode<00:03:32.840> to

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:33.410 
because it has to have flash mode to

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:35.770 
because it has to have flash mode to
make<00:03:33.530> it<00:03:33.710> signal<00:03:34.070> this<00:03:34.670> one<00:03:34.880> is<00:03:35.000> 70<00:03:35.420> lumens

00:03:35.770 --> 00:03:35.780 
make it signal this one is 70 lumens

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:37.990 
make it signal this one is 70 lumens
this<00:03:35.900> is<00:03:35.990> the<00:03:36.080> Princeton<00:03:36.470> tech<00:03:36.710> and<00:03:36.950> then<00:03:37.790> a

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:38.000 
this is the Princeton tech and then a

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.330 
this is the Princeton tech and then a
good<00:03:38.660> compass<00:03:39.080> of<00:03:39.230> any<00:03:39.410> kind<00:03:39.680> will<00:03:39.890> work<00:03:40.100> at

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:40.340 
good compass of any kind will work at

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:42.610 
good compass of any kind will work at
least<00:03:40.550> a<00:03:40.640> decent<00:03:40.850> one<00:03:41.210> that<00:03:41.600> has<00:03:41.810> some

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:42.620 
least a decent one that has some

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:44.200 
least a decent one that has some
features<00:03:43.010> that<00:03:43.040> you<00:03:43.310> need<00:03:43.490> like<00:03:43.700> the<00:03:43.850> mirror

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:44.210 
features that you need like the mirror

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:46.840 
features that you need like the mirror
and<00:03:44.500> a<00:03:45.500> moveable<00:03:45.890> bezel<00:03:46.190> ring<00:03:46.340> like<00:03:46.520> we<00:03:46.640> talked

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:46.850 
and a moveable bezel ring like we talked

00:03:46.850 --> 00:03:49.180 
and a moveable bezel ring like we talked
about<00:03:46.880> before<00:03:47.210> this<00:03:47.960> happens<00:03:48.380> to<00:03:48.470> be<00:03:48.620> a<00:03:48.770> little

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:49.190 
about before this happens to be a little

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:50.710 
about before this happens to be a little
bit<00:03:49.340> less<00:03:49.550> expensive<00:03:49.700> compass<00:03:50.420> this<00:03:50.570> is<00:03:50.690> a

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:50.720 
bit less expensive compass this is a

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.380 
bit less expensive compass this is a
silver<00:03:51.170> compass<00:03:51.560> but<00:03:52.190> it<00:03:52.310> will<00:03:52.430> do<00:03:52.640> for<00:03:52.880> your

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:53.390 
silver compass but it will do for your

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:55.210 
silver compass but it will do for your
absolute<00:03:53.930> necessities<00:03:54.440> if<00:03:54.620> you<00:03:54.740> have<00:03:54.920> to<00:03:55.070> have
