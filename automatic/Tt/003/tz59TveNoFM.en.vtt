alright guys this is my new light unit
it's<00:00:05.580> not<00:00:06.569> a<00:00:06.600> unit<00:00:07.020> as<00:00:07.170> such<00:00:07.500> it's<00:00:07.799> an<00:00:07.890> adapter

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:08.450 
it's not a unit as such it's an adapter

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:11.360 
it's not a unit as such it's an adapter
it<00:00:09.450> basically<00:00:10.170> it<00:00:10.650> just<00:00:10.679> comes<00:00:11.010> with<00:00:11.160> this

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:11.370 
it basically it just comes with this

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.759 
it basically it just comes with this
ballast<00:00:11.730> and<00:00:11.910> then<00:00:12.090> the<00:00:12.870> tube<00:00:13.110> that's<00:00:13.500> got

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
ballast and then the tube that's got

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:16.700 
ballast and then the tube that's got
what<00:00:14.160> four<00:00:14.780> plugs<00:00:15.780> that<00:00:16.020> you<00:00:16.080> plug<00:00:16.440> into<00:00:16.590> the

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:16.710 
what four plugs that you plug into the

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.650 
what four plugs that you plug into the
end<00:00:16.800> of<00:00:16.890> bulb<00:00:17.130> and<00:00:17.580> you<00:00:18.300> can<00:00:18.420> put<00:00:18.539> them

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
end of bulb and you can put them

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:19.939 
end of bulb and you can put them
wherever<00:00:18.779> you<00:00:18.900> want<00:00:18.960> you<00:00:19.320> can<00:00:19.470> screw<00:00:19.770> them

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:19.949 
wherever you want you can screw them

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.670 
wherever you want you can screw them
into<00:00:20.100> the<00:00:20.189> roof<00:00:20.640> of<00:00:20.820> your<00:00:20.850> hood<00:00:21.539> so<00:00:22.500> that

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:22.680 
into the roof of your hood so that

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.290 
into the roof of your hood so that
doesn't<00:00:23.130> matter<00:00:23.340> what<00:00:23.430> length<00:00:23.580> bulbs<00:00:24.029> are<00:00:24.180> you

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:24.300 
doesn't matter what length bulbs are you

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.230 
doesn't matter what length bulbs are you
can<00:00:24.449> adjust<00:00:24.750> it<00:00:25.310> there's<00:00:26.310> different<00:00:26.670> wattage

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:27.240 
can adjust it there's different wattage

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.140 
can adjust it there's different wattage
type<00:00:27.840> stick<00:00:28.140> I<00:00:28.349> think<00:00:28.740> this<00:00:28.920> is<00:00:29.099> a<00:00:29.130> 4<00:00:29.490> to<00:00:29.519> 54

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:30.150 
type stick I think this is a 4 to 54

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:32.510 
type stick I think this is a 4 to 54
watt<00:00:30.269> bulbs<00:00:30.830> so<00:00:31.830> I<00:00:31.859> just<00:00:32.040> wanted<00:00:32.219> to<00:00:32.279> show<00:00:32.489> you

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:32.520 
watt bulbs so I just wanted to show you

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.350 
watt bulbs so I just wanted to show you
what<00:00:33.290> they<00:00:34.290> look<00:00:34.469> like<00:00:34.530> with<00:00:35.460> the<00:00:35.640> two<00:00:35.880> bulbs

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:36.360 
what they look like with the two bulbs

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:37.520 
what they look like with the two bulbs
that<00:00:36.540> I<00:00:36.570> would<00:00:36.719> regionally<00:00:37.079> had<00:00:37.230> and<00:00:37.440> then

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
that I would regionally had and then

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:40.819 
that I would regionally had and then
what<00:00:37.800> it<00:00:37.890> looks<00:00:38.040> like<00:00:38.160> now<00:00:38.370> with<00:00:38.430> the<00:00:38.760> 4<00:00:39.090> and<00:00:39.829> T

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
what it looks like now with the 4 and T

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:42.799 
what it looks like now with the 4 and T
fives<00:00:41.100> on<00:00:41.309> which<00:00:41.969> I<00:00:42.180> think<00:00:42.420> makes<00:00:42.660> a

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
fives on which I think makes a

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:48.580 
fives on which I think makes a
significant<00:00:43.379> difference<00:00:43.969> so<00:00:46.610> here's<00:00:47.610> my<00:00:47.760> tank

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:48.590 
significant difference so here's my tank

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.200 
significant difference so here's my tank
the<00:00:49.590> lights<00:00:49.770> aren't<00:00:50.010> on<00:00:50.100> yet<00:00:50.309> as<00:00:50.610> you<00:00:50.850> can<00:00:51.000> see

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
the lights aren't on yet as you can see

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.540 
the lights aren't on yet as you can see
they're<00:00:51.960> about<00:00:52.289> common<00:00:52.620> under<00:00:52.800> 30<00:00:53.160> seconds

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
they're about common under 30 seconds

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.740 
they're about common under 30 seconds
and<00:00:53.610> so<00:00:53.699> I'll<00:00:53.760> just<00:00:53.910> switch<00:00:54.059> them<00:00:54.149> on<00:00:54.239> now<00:00:56.750> so

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
and so I'll just switch them on now so

00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:59.599 
and so I'll just switch them on now so
now<00:00:57.870> I've<00:00:57.960> got<00:00:58.140> two<00:00:58.350> of<00:00:58.469> the<00:00:58.559> t5<00:00:58.980> bulbs<00:00:59.219> on<00:00:59.460> now

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
now I've got two of the t5 bulbs on now

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:01.340 
now I've got two of the t5 bulbs on now
this<00:00:59.850> is<00:00:59.969> just<00:01:00.149> a<00:01:00.270> standard<00:01:00.510> light<00:01:00.870> unit<00:01:01.199> that

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:01.350 
this is just a standard light unit that

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.789 
this is just a standard light unit that
the<00:01:01.469> take<00:01:01.649> came<00:01:01.890> with<00:01:02.359> so<00:01:03.470> I'll<00:01:04.470> just<00:01:04.619> show<00:01:04.769> you

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
the take came with so I'll just show you

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:05.719 
the take came with so I'll just show you
what<00:01:04.920> some<00:01:05.070> of<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.220> hood<00:01:05.369> and<00:01:05.489> what<00:01:05.610> this

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
what some of the hood and what this

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.080 
what some of the hood and what this
ballast<00:01:06.060> looks<00:01:06.270> like<00:01:07.430> so<00:01:08.430> this<00:01:08.549> is<00:01:08.610> the<00:01:08.790> actual

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:09.090 
ballast looks like so this is the actual

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:11.899 
ballast looks like so this is the actual
balance<00:01:09.840> for<00:01:10.049> the<00:01:10.170> extra<00:01:10.920> two<00:01:11.100> bulbs<00:01:11.610> that<00:01:11.790> I

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
balance for the extra two bulbs that I

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:14.030 
balance for the extra two bulbs that I
have<00:01:12.060> I<00:01:12.299> just<00:01:13.020> open<00:01:13.409> up<00:01:13.439> the<00:01:13.560> lid<00:01:13.710> and<00:01:13.740> show<00:01:13.979> you

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
have I just open up the lid and show you

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.969 
have I just open up the lid and show you
what<00:01:14.850> I've<00:01:14.909> done<00:01:18.650> so<00:01:19.650> you've<00:01:19.740> got<00:01:19.860> the

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
what I've done so you've got the

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:23.210 
what I've done so you've got the
standard<00:01:20.430> light<00:01:20.610> unit<00:01:20.939> that<00:01:21.360> has<00:01:22.009> so<00:01:23.009> there's

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
standard light unit that has so there's

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.840 
standard light unit that has so there's
one<00:01:23.430> bulb<00:01:23.729> and<00:01:24.180> what's<00:01:24.420> going<00:01:24.600> to<00:01:24.689> a<00:01:24.750> very<00:01:24.900> dark

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:25.850 
one bulb and what's going to a very dark

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.370 
one bulb and what's going to a very dark
so<00:01:26.850> there's<00:01:27.000> one<00:01:27.180> bulb<00:01:27.420> here<00:01:27.689> and<00:01:28.170> there's<00:01:28.320> an

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:28.380 
so there's one bulb here and there's an

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:30.289 
so there's one bulb here and there's an
unwelcome<00:01:28.740> the<00:01:28.799> other<00:01:28.920> side<00:01:29.130> and<00:01:30.060> what<00:01:30.210> I've

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
unwelcome the other side and what I've

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:31.999 
unwelcome the other side and what I've
done<00:01:30.450> is<00:01:30.600> I've<00:01:30.750> put<00:01:30.900> an<00:01:31.049> extra<00:01:31.290> two<00:01:31.500> bulbs<00:01:31.890> on

00:01:31.999 --> 00:01:32.009 
done is I've put an extra two bulbs on

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:34.060 
done is I've put an extra two bulbs on
each<00:01:32.130> of<00:01:32.310> the<00:01:32.369> lid<00:01:32.549> so<00:01:32.729> there's<00:01:32.880> one<00:01:33.060> here<00:01:33.420> and

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:34.070 
each of the lid so there's one here and

00:01:34.070 --> 00:01:36.590 
each of the lid so there's one here and
then<00:01:35.070> there's<00:01:35.310> one<00:01:35.460> on<00:01:35.610> the<00:01:35.700> back<00:01:35.729> running

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:36.600 
then there's one on the back running

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:37.960 
then there's one on the back running
along<00:01:36.810> the<00:01:36.840> back<00:01:37.110> of<00:01:37.259> here

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:37.970 
along the back of here

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:43.490 
along the back of here
so<00:01:38.970> I<00:01:39.000> mean<00:01:39.180> up<00:01:40.040> shut<00:01:41.040> this<00:01:41.159> lid<00:01:41.310> back<00:01:41.490> down<00:01:42.500> so

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500 
so I mean up shut this lid back down so

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:50.270 
so I mean up shut this lid back down so
I'll<00:01:43.590> turn<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:43.860> new<00:01:43.979> lights<00:01:44.220> on<00:01:44.430> in

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.680 

so<00:01:51.280> that's<00:01:51.490> with<00:01:51.610> the<00:01:51.670> four<00:01:52.330> bulbs<00:01:52.810> on

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:54.690 
so that's with the four bulbs on

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:56.250 
so that's with the four bulbs on
initially<00:01:55.690> there<00:01:55.840> isn't<00:01:56.020> much<00:01:56.110> of<00:01:56.140> a

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:56.260 
initially there isn't much of a

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:57.870 
initially there isn't much of a
difference<00:01:56.650> but<00:01:56.800> if<00:01:56.890> you<00:01:57.040> look<00:01:57.340> closely<00:01:57.640> I

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:57.880 
difference but if you look closely I

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:02.490 
difference but if you look closely I
mean<00:01:59.190> all<00:02:00.190> the<00:02:00.340> parts<00:02:00.640> are<00:02:00.790> greener<00:02:01.120> and<00:02:01.500> the

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:02.500 
mean all the parts are greener and the

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:06.060 
mean all the parts are greener and the
red<00:02:02.650> a<00:02:02.680> plastic<00:02:03.130> redder<00:02:04.320> the<00:02:05.320> four<00:02:05.560> bulbs<00:02:05.800> are

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:06.070 
red a plastic redder the four bulbs are
