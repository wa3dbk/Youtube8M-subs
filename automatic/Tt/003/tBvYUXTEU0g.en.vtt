00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:48.540 
have to get in on open not and get past

00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:50.360 
have to get in on open not and get past
the<00:05:48.630> lasers<00:05:48.990> you<00:05:49.740> still<00:05:49.920> have<00:05:50.010> to<00:05:50.070> pay<00:05:50.130> a<00:05:50.220> lot

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:50.370 
the lasers you still have to pay a lot

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:52.010 
the lasers you still have to pay a lot
more<00:05:50.400> technical<00:05:50.940> spacing<00:05:51.300> as<00:05:51.420> well<00:05:51.570> because

00:05:52.010 --> 00:05:52.020 
more technical spacing as well because

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:54.410 
more technical spacing as well because
if<00:05:52.200> you<00:05:52.320> overextend<00:05:52.740> as<00:05:52.950> well<00:05:53.160> go<00:05:53.420> against

00:05:54.410 --> 00:05:54.420 
if you overextend as well go against
