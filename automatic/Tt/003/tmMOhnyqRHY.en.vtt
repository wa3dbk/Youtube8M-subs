little<00:03:09.930> confused<00:03:10.530> about<00:03:10.880> meaning<00:03:11.880> we<00:03:12.150> showed

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:12.450 
little confused about meaning we showed

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:15.650 
little confused about meaning we showed
ground<00:03:13.020> zeroes<00:03:13.440> at<00:03:13.740> PAX<00:03:14.310> last<00:03:14.670> year<00:03:15.090> and<00:03:15.540> there

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:15.660 
ground zeroes at PAX last year and there

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.720 
ground zeroes at PAX last year and there
was<00:03:15.690> the<00:03:15.840> phantom<00:03:16.200> pain<00:03:16.410> at<00:03:16.740> VGA<00:03:17.070> s<00:03:17.190> now<00:03:17.520> you're

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:17.730 
was the phantom pain at VGA s now you're

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.790 
was the phantom pain at VGA s now you're
saying<00:03:17.940> this<00:03:18.090> is<00:03:18.239> Metal<00:03:18.450> Gear<00:03:18.510> Solid<00:03:18.870> 5<00:03:19.080> and<00:03:19.680> we

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:19.800 
saying this is Metal Gear Solid 5 and we

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:21.229 
saying this is Metal Gear Solid 5 and we
saw<00:03:19.950> some<00:03:20.190> new<00:03:20.310> footage<00:03:20.610> in<00:03:20.730> this<00:03:20.850> but<00:03:21.090> also

00:03:21.229 --> 00:03:21.239 
saw some new footage in this but also

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:23.300 
saw some new footage in this but also
footage<00:03:21.660> of<00:03:21.900> you<00:03:22.410> know<00:03:22.500> from<00:03:22.709> ground<00:03:22.950> zeroes

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:23.310 
footage of you know from ground zeroes

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.870 
footage of you know from ground zeroes
and<00:03:23.520> from<00:03:23.790> the<00:03:23.940> VGA<00:03:24.300> s<00:03:24.510> so<00:03:24.870> how<00:03:25.080> is<00:03:25.800> the<00:03:26.459> phantom

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
and from the VGA s so how is the phantom

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.640 
and from the VGA s so how is the phantom
pain<00:03:27.030> and<00:03:27.300> ground<00:03:27.510> zeroes<00:03:27.900> are<00:03:28.050> they<00:03:28.140> are<00:03:28.530> they

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:28.650 
pain and ground zeroes are they are they

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.350 
pain and ground zeroes are they are they
different<00:03:28.920> games<00:03:29.340> or<00:03:29.580> is<00:03:29.670> it<00:03:29.790> all<00:03:30.000> Metal<00:03:30.300> Gear

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:30.360 
different games or is it all Metal Gear

00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:32.180 
different games or is it all Metal Gear
Solid<00:03:30.780> 5<00:03:30.900> how<00:03:31.110> does<00:03:31.230> that<00:03:31.380> work<00:03:31.530> the<00:03:31.920> ground

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:32.190 
Solid 5 how does that work the ground

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.670 
Solid 5 how does that work the ground
zero<00:03:32.520> do<00:03:32.670> you<00:03:32.910> know<00:03:33.120> ah<00:03:33.180> so<00:03:34.020> to<00:03:34.170> explain<00:03:34.500> how

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:34.680 
zero do you know ah so to explain how

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:36.260 
zero do you know ah so to explain how
these<00:03:34.800> things<00:03:34.980> fit<00:03:35.130> together<00:03:35.340> ground<00:03:35.880> zeroes

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:36.270 
these things fit together ground zeroes

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:38.510 
these things fit together ground zeroes
is<00:03:36.450> basically<00:03:36.780> a<00:03:36.870> prologue<00:03:37.350> and<00:03:37.620> this<00:03:38.310> takes

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:38.520 
is basically a prologue and this takes

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.280 
is basically a prologue and this takes
place<00:03:38.670> about<00:03:38.880> nine<00:03:39.209> years<00:03:39.239> prior<00:03:39.780> to<00:03:39.959> phantom

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:40.290 
place about nine years prior to phantom

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:41.870 
place about nine years prior to phantom
pain<00:03:40.470> so<00:03:40.680> phantom<00:03:41.010> pain<00:03:41.160> takes<00:03:41.400> place<00:03:41.610> nine

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:41.880 
pain so phantom pain takes place nine

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.670 
pain so phantom pain takes place nine
years<00:03:42.090> after<00:03:42.239> ground<00:03:42.570> zeroes<00:03:42.870> but<00:03:43.500> put

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:43.680 
years after ground zeroes but put

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.979 
years after ground zeroes but put
together<00:03:43.800> these<00:03:44.280> two<00:03:45.030> pieces<00:03:45.239> comprise

00:03:45.979 --> 00:03:45.989 
together these two pieces comprise

00:03:45.989 --> 00:03:48.350 
together these two pieces comprise
millyar<00:03:46.350> Solid<00:03:46.620> 5<00:03:46.860> and<00:03:47.520> the<00:03:47.850> phantom<00:03:48.150> pain<00:03:48.300> is

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:48.360 
millyar Solid 5 and the phantom pain is

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:49.640 
millyar Solid 5 and the phantom pain is
you<00:03:48.660> know<00:03:48.750> the<00:03:48.840> main<00:03:48.989> part<00:03:49.200> of<00:03:49.230> the<00:03:49.320> game<00:03:49.350> and

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:49.650 
you know the main part of the game and

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.699 
you know the main part of the game and
it's<00:03:49.890> really<00:03:50.190> a<00:03:50.280> huge<00:03:50.670> game<00:03:51.000> so<00:03:51.270> when<00:03:51.750> are<00:03:52.500> they

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:52.709 
it's really a huge game so when are they

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:54.380 
it's really a huge game so when are they
going<00:03:52.950> to<00:03:53.070> like<00:03:53.340> you're<00:03:53.610> gonna<00:03:53.730> buy<00:03:54.000> Metal

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390 
going to like you're gonna buy Metal

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:56.090 
going to like you're gonna buy Metal
Gear<00:03:54.420> Solid<00:03:54.840> 5<00:03:54.989> and<00:03:55.290> you'll<00:03:55.380> get<00:03:55.560> this<00:03:55.860> all

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:56.100 
Gear Solid 5 and you'll get this all

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.280 
Gear Solid 5 and you'll get this all
together<00:03:56.370> or<00:03:56.880> how<00:03:57.180> does<00:03:57.360> it<00:03:57.510> how<00:03:58.110> do<00:03:58.170> you

00:03:58.280 --> 00:03:58.290 
together or how does it how do you

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.770 
together or how does it how do you
experience<00:03:58.530> it<00:03:58.830> so<00:03:59.730> we<00:03:59.880> can't<00:04:00.120> comment<00:04:00.600> just

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:00.780 
experience it so we can't comment just

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.180 
experience it so we can't comment just
yet<00:04:01.050> on<00:04:01.230> how<00:04:01.440> these<00:04:01.680> things<00:04:01.890> will<00:04:02.070> be

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:02.190 
yet on how these things will be

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:04.520 
yet on how these things will be
distributed<00:04:03.060> and<00:04:03.180> sold<00:04:03.390> but<00:04:03.930> what<00:04:04.080> we<00:04:04.140> can<00:04:04.320> say

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:04.530 
distributed and sold but what we can say

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:06.890 
distributed and sold but what we can say
is<00:04:04.650> that<00:04:04.860> you<00:04:05.070> know<00:04:05.310> phantom<00:04:05.610> pain<00:04:05.820> and<00:04:06.120> ground

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
is that you know phantom pain and ground

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.210 
is that you know phantom pain and ground
zeroes<00:04:07.110> will<00:04:07.200> be<00:04:07.290> two<00:04:07.440> parts<00:04:07.680> of<00:04:07.770> a<00:04:07.830> whole<00:04:07.950> and

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
zeroes will be two parts of a whole and

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:10.040 
zeroes will be two parts of a whole and
ground<00:04:08.580> zeroes<00:04:08.820> will<00:04:08.970> come<00:04:09.209> first<00:04:09.450> it'll<00:04:09.810> kind

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:10.050 
ground zeroes will come first it'll kind

00:04:10.050 --> 00:04:12.229 
ground zeroes will come first it'll kind
of<00:04:10.080> be<00:04:10.400> phantom<00:04:11.400> pain<00:04:11.519> on<00:04:11.640> a<00:04:11.670> smaller<00:04:11.940> scale<00:04:12.180> so

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:12.239 
of be phantom pain on a smaller scale so

00:04:12.239 --> 00:04:14.270 
of be phantom pain on a smaller scale so
it'll<00:04:12.570> be<00:04:12.630> open<00:04:12.750> world<00:04:13.080> but<00:04:13.590> not<00:04:13.739> quite<00:04:13.980> as<00:04:14.130> big

00:04:14.270 --> 00:04:14.280 
it'll be open world but not quite as big

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:15.740 
it'll be open world but not quite as big
as<00:04:14.430> map<00:04:14.610> and<00:04:14.760> pain<00:04:14.910> so<00:04:15.090> it'll<00:04:15.300> allow<00:04:15.330> the<00:04:15.510> user

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
as map and pain so it'll allow the user

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:17.870 
as map and pain so it'll allow the user
to<00:04:15.780> jump<00:04:16.019> in<00:04:16.200> learn<00:04:16.890> how<00:04:17.130> to<00:04:17.160> sneak<00:04:17.519> you<00:04:17.790> know

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:17.880 
to jump in learn how to sneak you know

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:19.520 
to jump in learn how to sneak you know
in<00:04:17.970> real<00:04:18.120> time<00:04:18.359> in<00:04:18.630> that<00:04:18.780> world<00:04:19.019> that<00:04:19.320> open

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:19.530 
in real time in that world that open

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:21.470 
in real time in that world that open
world<00:04:19.709> and<00:04:20.100> then<00:04:20.489> later<00:04:20.669> on<00:04:20.760> after<00:04:21.120> they<00:04:21.299> kind

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:21.480 
world and then later on after they kind

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:22.850 
world and then later on after they kind
of<00:04:21.510> get<00:04:21.600> used<00:04:21.750> to<00:04:21.840> that<00:04:21.960> then<00:04:22.200> that<00:04:22.560> the<00:04:22.680> pain

00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:22.860 
of get used to that then that the pain

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:24.710 
of get used to that then that the pain
will<00:04:22.979> come<00:04:23.039> along<00:04:23.310> and<00:04:23.550> they'll<00:04:24.060> be<00:04:24.240> thrown

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:24.720 
will come along and they'll be thrown

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.990 
will come along and they'll be thrown
into<00:04:24.870> this<00:04:24.990> huge<00:04:25.590> gigantic<00:04:26.280> open<00:04:26.669> world

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.000 
into this huge gigantic open world

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.690 
into this huge gigantic open world
so<00:04:27.170> it's<00:04:28.170> a<00:04:28.230> two-step<00:04:28.740> process<00:04:29.130> the<00:04:29.550> game

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:29.700 
so it's a two-step process the game

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:31.220 
so it's a two-step process the game
design<00:04:30.000> and<00:04:30.240> together<00:04:30.540> these<00:04:30.870> things<00:04:31.050> will

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:31.230 
design and together these things will

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:33.710 
design and together these things will
comprise<00:04:32.180> now<00:04:33.180> there's<00:04:33.480> a<00:04:33.510> lot<00:04:33.630> of

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:33.720 
comprise now there's a lot of

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.150 
comprise now there's a lot of
speculation<00:04:33.930> amongst<00:04:34.710> the<00:04:34.770> fans<00:04:34.920> kind<00:04:35.070> of

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:35.160 
speculation amongst the fans kind of

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:36.440 
speculation amongst the fans kind of

I<00:07:35.310> think<00:07:35.790> fans<00:07:36.150> can<00:07:36.450> expect<00:07:36.540> to<00:07:36.840> see<00:07:36.990> some

00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:37.020 
I think fans can expect to see some

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:38.810 
I think fans can expect to see some
familiar<00:07:37.590> faces<00:07:37.620> as<00:07:38.040> well<00:07:38.190> returning<00:07:38.730> from

00:07:38.810 --> 00:07:38.820 
familiar faces as well returning from

00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:40.820 
familiar faces as well returning from
the<00:07:39.000> old<00:07:39.120> saga<00:07:39.360> but<00:07:40.200> you<00:07:40.350> know<00:07:40.440> Yoji<00:07:40.770> Shinkawa

00:07:40.820 --> 00:07:40.830 
the old saga but you know Yoji Shinkawa

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:42.200 
the old saga but you know Yoji Shinkawa
has<00:07:41.280> been<00:07:41.430> working<00:07:41.700> on<00:07:41.820> some<00:07:41.970> new<00:07:42.060> characters

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:42.210 
has been working on some new characters

00:07:42.210 --> 00:07:44.090 
has been working on some new characters
as<00:07:42.510> well<00:07:42.690> and<00:07:42.930> i<00:07:43.020> think<00:07:43.050> you<00:07:43.350> know<00:07:43.440> it's<00:07:43.800> a

00:07:44.090 --> 00:07:44.100 
as well and i think you know it's a

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:45.380 
as well and i think you know it's a
different<00:07:44.430> taste<00:07:44.700> from<00:07:44.850> what<00:07:45.060> he's<00:07:45.150> done<00:07:45.270> in

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:45.390 
different taste from what he's done in

00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:52.700 
different taste from what he's done in
the<00:07:45.450> past<00:07:45.479> so<00:07:45.840> I<00:07:46.229> think<00:07:51.440> the<00:07:52.440> Metal<00:07:52.680> Gear

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:52.710 
the past so I think the Metal Gear

00:07:52.710 --> 00:07:54.080 
the past so I think the Metal Gear
series<00:07:52.950> has<00:07:53.160> always<00:07:53.310> been<00:07:53.490> known<00:07:53.669> for<00:07:53.820> you
