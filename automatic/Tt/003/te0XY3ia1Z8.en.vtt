basically what you see here is you have

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:45.979 
basically what you see here is you have
a<00:00:44.370> soccer<00:00:44.670> ball<00:00:44.969> and<00:00:45.180> you<00:00:45.360> have<00:00:45.539> some

this<00:01:30.360> ball<00:01:30.630> go<00:01:30.900> in<00:01:30.930> so<00:01:31.470> let's<00:01:31.680> see<00:01:31.829> if<00:01:31.979> this

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
this ball go in so let's see if this

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.850 
this ball go in so let's see if this
lands<00:01:32.640> right<00:01:32.909> there<00:01:33.750> we<00:01:33.960> go<00:01:34.110> and<00:01:34.380> let's<00:01:34.619> see<00:01:34.770> if

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
lands right there we go and let's see if

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.230 
lands right there we go and let's see if
it<00:01:35.009> ends<00:01:35.220> up<00:01:35.280> making<00:01:35.460> it<00:01:35.640> in<00:01:35.729> the<00:01:35.790> box<00:01:36.030> it

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
it ends up making it in the box it

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.780 
it ends up making it in the box it
doesn't<00:01:36.630> so<00:01:37.229> we<00:01:37.409> actually<00:01:37.590> have<00:01:38.040> another<00:01:38.460> item

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:38.790 
doesn't so we actually have another item

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.859 
doesn't so we actually have another item
here<00:01:38.939> that<00:01:39.299> we<00:01:39.390> can<00:01:39.420> bring<00:01:39.750> in<00:01:40.340> right<00:01:41.340> here<00:01:41.869> and

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869 
here that we can bring in right here and

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.499 
here that we can bring in right here and
we'll<00:01:43.799> go<00:01:43.979> ahead<00:01:44.070> and<00:01:44.250> see<00:01:44.759> if<00:01:44.880> that<00:01:44.909> helps<00:01:45.270> at

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509 
we'll go ahead and see if that helps at

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:50.020 
we'll go ahead and see if that helps at
all

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.440 

there<00:01:51.030> we<00:01:51.150> go

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:53.450 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.779 

and<00:01:53.780> so<00:01:54.469> as<00:01:54.619> you<00:01:54.770> can<00:01:54.860> see<00:01:55.100> we<00:01:55.280> completed<00:01:55.670> the

00:01:55.779 --> 00:01:55.789 
and so as you can see we completed the

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:57.789 
and so as you can see we completed the
level<00:01:56.210> we<00:01:56.960> can<00:01:57.110> go<00:01:57.200> back<00:01:57.380> to<00:01:57.409> the<00:01:57.619> main<00:01:57.740> menu

00:01:57.789 --> 00:01:57.799 
level we can go back to the main menu

00:01:57.799 --> 00:02:00.340 
level we can go back to the main menu
once<00:01:58.310> it's<00:01:58.460> complete<00:01:58.759> we<00:01:58.939> simply<00:01:59.270> hit<00:01:59.420> next<00:01:59.689> so

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:00.350 
once it's complete we simply hit next so

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:01.779 
once it's complete we simply hit next so
here<00:02:00.560> we<00:02:00.680> have<00:02:00.710> another<00:02:01.070> level<00:02:01.399> and<00:02:01.579> now<00:02:01.729> we

00:02:01.779 --> 00:02:01.789 
here we have another level and now we

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:03.310 
here we have another level and now we
have<00:02:01.969> a<00:02:02.090> little<00:02:02.450> different<00:02:02.780> situation<00:02:02.929> we

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
have a little different situation we

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.859 
have a little different situation we
have<00:02:03.350> a<00:02:03.469> slope<00:02:03.799> going<00:02:04.130> away<00:02:04.250> from<00:02:04.610> the<00:02:04.700> box<00:02:04.939> so

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:05.869 
have a slope going away from the box so

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:08.259 
have a slope going away from the box so
as<00:02:06.259> you<00:02:06.320> can<00:02:06.679> note<00:02:06.920> as<00:02:07.070> you<00:02:07.310> can<00:02:07.460> see<00:02:07.729> if<00:02:07.969> we

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:08.269 
as you can note as you can see if we

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:09.790 
as you can note as you can see if we
simply<00:02:08.599> just<00:02:08.750> let<00:02:08.899> the<00:02:09.019> ball<00:02:09.200> go<00:02:09.349> on<00:02:09.470> its<00:02:09.619> own

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:09.800 
simply just let the ball go on its own

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.949 
simply just let the ball go on its own
it's<00:02:10.099> going<00:02:10.429> to<00:02:10.489> go<00:02:10.580> the<00:02:10.700> wrong<00:02:10.789> direction<00:02:10.959> so

00:02:11.949 --> 00:02:11.959 
it's going to go the wrong direction so

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:13.660 
it's going to go the wrong direction so
we<00:02:12.170> need<00:02:12.319> to<00:02:12.410> use<00:02:12.560> these<00:02:12.739> items<00:02:12.980> that<00:02:13.280> are<00:02:13.400> here

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:13.670 
we need to use these items that are here

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:15.339 
we need to use these items that are here
available<00:02:14.150> to<00:02:14.300> us<00:02:14.450> so<00:02:14.930> we're<00:02:15.019> going<00:02:15.140> to<00:02:15.230> go

00:02:15.339 --> 00:02:15.349 
available to us so we're going to go

00:02:15.349 --> 00:02:18.190 
available to us so we're going to go
ahead<00:02:15.380> and<00:02:15.940> drag<00:02:16.940> one<00:02:17.540> of<00:02:17.660> these<00:02:17.810> over<00:02:18.170> here

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:18.200 
ahead and drag one of these over here

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:20.500 
ahead and drag one of these over here
and<00:02:18.739> then<00:02:19.700> we're<00:02:19.790> going<00:02:19.880> to<00:02:19.940> grab<00:02:20.180> the<00:02:20.360> other

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:20.510 
and then we're going to grab the other

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:23.979 
and then we're going to grab the other
one<00:02:20.630> and<00:02:21.489> let's<00:02:22.489> see<00:02:22.760> if<00:02:23.030> this<00:02:23.599> ends<00:02:23.930> up

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:23.989 
one and let's see if this ends up

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:31.830 
one and let's see if this ends up
working<00:02:24.230> out<00:02:24.530> the<00:02:24.769> way<00:02:24.799> I'm<00:02:25.040> hoping<00:02:25.370> it<00:02:25.489> does

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:31.840 

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:34.990 

okay<00:02:32.840> so<00:02:32.900> as<00:02:33.440> you<00:02:34.069> see<00:02:34.250> we<00:02:34.400> need<00:02:34.549> a<00:02:34.579> little<00:02:34.819> bit

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:35.000 
okay so as you see we need a little bit

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.699 
okay so as you see we need a little bit
of<00:02:35.030> adjustment<00:02:36.489> so<00:02:37.489> I'm<00:02:37.730> going<00:02:37.790> to<00:02:37.910> try

00:02:38.699 --> 00:02:38.709 
of adjustment so I'm going to try

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:41.199 
of adjustment so I'm going to try
something<00:02:39.709> like<00:02:39.739> that<00:02:39.920> let's<00:02:40.819> see<00:02:41.000> if<00:02:41.120> this

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:41.209 
something like that let's see if this

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:49.949 
something like that let's see if this
works<00:02:41.390> out<00:02:45.220> no<00:02:46.220> all<00:02:47.000> right<00:02:47.120> we<00:02:47.329> need<00:02:47.420> it<00:02:47.769> oops

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:49.959 
works out no all right we need it oops

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:53.470 
works out no all right we need it oops
we<00:02:50.959> need<00:02:51.140> to<00:02:51.319> tilt<00:02:51.880> this<00:02:52.880> little<00:02:53.299> guy<00:02:53.450> right

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:53.480 
we need to tilt this little guy right

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:56.650 
we need to tilt this little guy right
here<00:02:54.579> let's<00:02:55.579> try<00:02:55.730> that<00:02:55.940> one<00:02:56.000> more<00:02:56.120> time<00:02:56.269> so

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660 
here let's try that one more time so

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.809 
here let's try that one more time so
basically<00:02:57.110> as<00:02:57.230> you<00:02:57.349> see<00:02:57.620> you<00:02:58.220> have<00:02:58.370> available

00:02:58.809 --> 00:02:58.819 
basically as you see you have available

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:00.610 
basically as you see you have available
items<00:02:59.150> to<00:02:59.329> use<00:02:59.480> at<00:02:59.630> your<00:02:59.660> disposal<00:03:00.109> which<00:03:00.470> you

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
items to use at your disposal which you

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:06.789 
items to use at your disposal which you
just<00:03:00.829> simply<00:03:01.389> have<00:03:02.389> to<00:03:03.340> fine-tune<00:03:04.340> and<00:03:05.799> you

00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:06.799 
just simply have to fine-tune and you

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:09.580 
just simply have to fine-tune and you
just<00:03:07.010> go<00:03:07.280> through<00:03:07.609> here<00:03:08.540> and<00:03:08.690> basically<00:03:09.260> the

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590 
just go through here and basically the

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.309 
just go through here and basically the
whole<00:03:09.709> object<00:03:09.950> is<00:03:10.400> just<00:03:10.730> to<00:03:11.019> get<00:03:12.019> the<00:03:12.139> ball

00:03:12.309 --> 00:03:12.319 
whole object is just to get the ball

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:15.280 
whole object is just to get the ball
into<00:03:12.470> the<00:03:12.650> box<00:03:12.799> as<00:03:13.160> you<00:03:13.310> go<00:03:13.690> so<00:03:14.690> let's<00:03:14.989> try<00:03:15.230> this

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:15.290 
into the box as you go so let's try this

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.770 
into the box as you go so let's try this
one<00:03:15.590> more<00:03:15.680> time<00:03:15.799> and<00:03:16.370> then<00:03:16.579> if<00:03:17.120> not<00:03:17.209> we'll<00:03:17.630> just

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:17.780 
one more time and then if not we'll just

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.930 
one more time and then if not we'll just
skip<00:03:17.900> on<00:03:18.079> to<00:03:18.260> another<00:03:18.440> level<00:03:18.680> yeah<00:03:19.220> so<00:03:19.790> as<00:03:19.880> you

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:19.940 
skip on to another level yeah so as you

00:03:19.940 --> 00:03:21.550 
skip on to another level yeah so as you
see<00:03:20.239> you<00:03:20.480> know<00:03:20.600> eventually<00:03:21.200> you'll<00:03:21.319> get<00:03:21.440> the

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:21.560 
see you know eventually you'll get the

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:22.750 
see you know eventually you'll get the
hang<00:03:21.590> of<00:03:21.799> it<00:03:21.889> I've<00:03:22.040> already<00:03:22.190> completed<00:03:22.609> this

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 
hang of it I've already completed this

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:28.390 
hang of it I've already completed this
level<00:03:23.120> before<00:03:24.760> and<00:03:26.170> so<00:03:27.170> you'll<00:03:27.980> be<00:03:28.130> able<00:03:28.160> to

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:28.400 
level before and so you'll be able to

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.220 
level before and so you'll be able to
progress<00:03:28.609> to<00:03:28.819> the<00:03:28.970> level<00:03:29.299> once<00:03:29.480> it<00:03:29.959> drops

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.230 
progress to the level once it drops

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:31.390 
progress to the level once it drops
through<00:03:30.560> so<00:03:30.739> it's<00:03:30.859> just<00:03:30.980> a<00:03:31.130> matter<00:03:31.280> of

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:31.400 
through so it's just a matter of

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:36.069 
through so it's just a matter of
adjustment<00:03:32.500> here<00:03:33.500> in<00:03:33.769> the<00:03:33.950> game<00:03:34.209> on<00:03:35.209> there<00:03:35.930> we

00:03:36.069 --> 00:03:36.079 
adjustment here in the game on there we

00:03:36.079 --> 00:03:37.629 
adjustment here in the game on there we
go<00:03:36.200> we<00:03:36.319> almost<00:03:36.470> had<00:03:36.709> it<00:03:36.739> so<00:03:37.370> we'll<00:03:37.489> go<00:03:37.579> ahead

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:37.639 
go we almost had it so we'll go ahead

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:39.490 
go we almost had it so we'll go ahead
and<00:03:37.730> quit<00:03:37.940> out<00:03:38.090> of<00:03:38.120> this<00:03:38.329> level<00:03:38.750> and<00:03:38.870> we'll<00:03:39.410> go

00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:39.500 
and quit out of this level and we'll go

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:40.900 
and quit out of this level and we'll go
into<00:03:39.530> a<00:03:39.709> harder<00:03:40.099> level<00:03:40.250> just<00:03:40.519> to<00:03:40.639> show<00:03:40.849> you

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:40.910 
into a harder level just to show you

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:43.390 
into a harder level just to show you
what<00:03:41.120> it's<00:03:41.239> like<00:03:41.470> so<00:03:42.470> coming<00:03:42.889> into<00:03:43.069> one<00:03:43.310> of

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:43.400 
what it's like so coming into one of

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.160 
what it's like so coming into one of
these<00:03:43.459> levels<00:03:43.700> here's<00:03:44.000> another<00:03:44.239> idea<00:03:44.389> of<00:03:44.780> a

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:45.170 
these levels here's another idea of a

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:47.379 
these levels here's another idea of a
level<00:03:45.590> now<00:03:46.130> if<00:03:46.280> I<00:03:46.400> just<00:03:46.549> let<00:03:46.700> the<00:03:46.880> ball<00:03:47.030> roll<00:03:47.060> on

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:47.389 
level now if I just let the ball roll on

00:03:47.389 --> 00:03:49.360 
level now if I just let the ball roll on
its<00:03:47.569> own<00:03:47.780> again<00:03:48.650> it's<00:03:48.859> not<00:03:48.980> going<00:03:49.130> to<00:03:49.220> make<00:03:49.310> it

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
its own again it's not going to make it

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:50.890 
its own again it's not going to make it
through<00:03:49.489> and<00:03:50.030> here's<00:03:50.239> the<00:03:50.389> other<00:03:50.540> thing<00:03:50.660> is

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:50.900 
through and here's the other thing is

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:52.569 
through and here's the other thing is
once<00:03:51.380> you<00:03:51.500> get<00:03:51.680> further<00:03:51.859> into<00:03:52.069> levels<00:03:52.430> there

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:52.579 
once you get further into levels there

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:54.580 
once you get further into levels there
will<00:03:52.669> be<00:03:52.730> these<00:03:52.880> stars<00:03:53.269> in<00:03:53.510> the<00:03:53.599> level<00:03:53.870> and<00:03:54.019> you

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:54.590 
will be these stars in the level and you

00:03:54.590 --> 00:03:56.319 
will be these stars in the level and you
can't<00:03:54.859> just<00:03:55.099> progress<00:03:55.519> by<00:03:55.760> dropping<00:03:56.150> the<00:03:56.239> ball

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:56.329 
can't just progress by dropping the ball

00:03:56.329 --> 00:03:57.879 
can't just progress by dropping the ball
in<00:03:56.450> the<00:03:56.510> box<00:03:56.720> you<00:03:56.930> have<00:03:57.049> to<00:03:57.169> go<00:03:57.319> get<00:03:57.530> the<00:03:57.650> star

00:03:57.879 --> 00:03:57.889 
in the box you have to go get the star

00:03:57.889 --> 00:04:00.819 
in the box you have to go get the star
first<00:03:58.370> and<00:03:58.639> then<00:03:59.200> get<00:04:00.200> the<00:04:00.319> ball<00:04:00.470> in<00:04:00.590> the<00:04:00.620> box

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:00.829 
first and then get the ball in the box

00:04:00.829 --> 00:04:02.289 
first and then get the ball in the box
so<00:04:01.099> as<00:04:01.190> you<00:04:01.310> see<00:04:01.519> it's<00:04:01.670> clearly<00:04:01.909> not<00:04:02.030> going<00:04:02.239> to

00:04:02.289 --> 00:04:02.299 
so as you see it's clearly not going to

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:04.300 
so as you see it's clearly not going to
make<00:04:02.450> it<00:04:02.510> so<00:04:02.900> here<00:04:03.230> we<00:04:03.349> have<00:04:03.379> items<00:04:03.950> and<00:04:04.159> these

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:04.310 
make it so here we have items and these

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:06.940 
make it so here we have items and these
are<00:04:04.430> a<00:04:04.459> little<00:04:04.610> different<00:04:05.319> still<00:04:06.319> I'll<00:04:06.560> place

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:06.950 
are a little different still I'll place

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:07.390 
are a little different still I'll place
some<00:04:07.189> of<00:04:07.280> the

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:07.400 
some of the

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.360 
some of the
these<00:04:07.489> and<00:04:07.730> you'll<00:04:07.879> see<00:04:08.409> what<00:04:09.409> they<00:04:09.620> do<00:04:09.680> here

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:10.370 
these and you'll see what they do here

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:15.280 
these and you'll see what they do here
in<00:04:10.519> just<00:04:11.269> a<00:04:11.420> second<00:04:12.459> oops<00:04:13.459> here<00:04:14.329> we<00:04:14.420> go<00:04:14.599> place

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:15.290 
in just a second oops here we go place

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:17.229 
in just a second oops here we go place
that<00:04:15.530> over<00:04:15.709> there<00:04:15.950> and<00:04:16.639> we'll<00:04:16.759> go<00:04:16.910> ahead<00:04:17.030> and

00:04:17.229 --> 00:04:17.239 
that over there and we'll go ahead and

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:19.599 
that over there and we'll go ahead and
hit<00:04:17.359> play<00:04:17.539> so<00:04:18.410> here<00:04:18.739> we<00:04:18.769> have<00:04:18.889> these<00:04:19.310> other

00:04:19.599 --> 00:04:19.609 
hit play so here we have these other

00:04:19.609 --> 00:04:22.120 
hit play so here we have these other
sorts<00:04:20.060> of<00:04:20.120> items<00:04:20.329> here<00:04:20.900> that<00:04:20.930> are<00:04:21.680> now<00:04:21.859> at<00:04:22.009> our

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.130 
sorts of items here that are now at our

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:23.920 
sorts of items here that are now at our
disposal<00:04:22.490> and<00:04:22.789> it's<00:04:22.940> going<00:04:23.180> to<00:04:23.300> go<00:04:23.449> ahead<00:04:23.539> and

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:23.930 
disposal and it's going to go ahead and

00:04:23.930 --> 00:04:26.770 
disposal and it's going to go ahead and
push<00:04:24.560> this<00:04:24.770> ball<00:04:25.009> forward<00:04:25.490> there<00:04:25.780> we

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780 
push this ball forward there we

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:30.999 
push this ball forward there we
collected<00:04:27.320> our<00:04:27.410> star<00:04:27.710> now<00:04:28.930> now<00:04:29.930> hopefully<00:04:30.710> we

00:04:30.999 --> 00:04:31.009 
collected our star now now hopefully we

00:04:31.009 --> 00:04:36.040 
collected our star now now hopefully we
can<00:04:31.130> get<00:04:31.250> the<00:04:31.400> ball<00:04:31.550> through<00:04:33.130> so<00:04:34.130> close<00:04:35.050> okay

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.050 
can get the ball through so close okay

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:39.520 
can get the ball through so close okay
let's<00:04:36.259> see<00:04:36.440> if<00:04:36.560> we<00:04:36.710> can<00:04:38.050> do<00:04:39.050> that<00:04:39.110> one<00:04:39.470> more

00:04:39.520 --> 00:04:39.530 
let's see if we can do that one more

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:42.189 
let's see if we can do that one more
time<00:04:39.880> but<00:04:40.880> as<00:04:41.030> you<00:04:41.210> see<00:04:41.389> here<00:04:41.690> basically<00:04:41.900> the

00:04:42.189 --> 00:04:42.199 
time but as you see here basically the

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:44.560 
time but as you see here basically the
idea<00:04:42.260> is<00:04:42.620> to<00:04:42.680> use<00:04:42.800> the<00:04:43.090> items<00:04:44.090> that<00:04:44.210> are<00:04:44.419> given

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:44.570 
idea is to use the items that are given

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:46.689 
idea is to use the items that are given
to<00:04:44.780> you<00:04:45.080> in<00:04:45.289> each<00:04:45.410> level<00:04:45.680> in<00:04:46.039> order<00:04:46.490> to

00:04:46.689 --> 00:04:46.699 
to you in each level in order to

00:04:46.699 --> 00:04:48.670 
to you in each level in order to
complete<00:04:47.090> it<00:04:47.270> it's<00:04:47.600> a<00:04:47.720> real<00:04:47.930> simple<00:04:48.110> game<00:04:48.470> you

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:48.680 
complete it it's a real simple game you

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.909 
complete it it's a real simple game you
just<00:04:48.830> collect<00:04:49.160> the<00:04:49.310> Stars<00:04:49.639> and<00:04:50.710> lead<00:04:51.710> the

00:04:51.909 --> 00:04:51.919 
just collect the Stars and lead the

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:55.270 
just collect the Stars and lead the
soccer<00:04:52.160> ball<00:04:52.310> into<00:04:52.940> the<00:04:53.060> box<00:04:53.210> so<00:04:54.199> it'll<00:04:55.130> take

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:55.280 
soccer ball into the box so it'll take

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:56.950 
soccer ball into the box so it'll take
some<00:04:55.460> fine-tuning<00:04:55.729> and<00:04:56.210> adjustment<00:04:56.750> as<00:04:56.840> you

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:56.960 
some fine-tuning and adjustment as you

00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:58.659 
some fine-tuning and adjustment as you
play<00:04:57.139> each<00:04:57.320> level<00:04:57.710> and<00:04:57.919> they<00:04:58.130> do<00:04:58.190> get<00:04:58.460> much

00:04:58.659 --> 00:04:58.669 
play each level and they do get much

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:01.150 
play each level and they do get much
harder<00:04:59.060> here's<00:04:59.599> a<00:04:59.750> level<00:05:00.289> 7<00:05:00.650> where<00:05:00.830> I'm<00:05:00.919> at

00:05:01.150 --> 00:05:01.160 
harder here's a level 7 where I'm at

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:03.370 
harder here's a level 7 where I'm at
just<00:05:01.370> so<00:05:01.460> you<00:05:01.580> can<00:05:01.699> see<00:05:01.760> so<00:05:02.690> we<00:05:02.990> have<00:05:03.139> some

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:03.380 
just so you can see so we have some

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:05.620 
just so you can see so we have some
different<00:05:03.889> items<00:05:04.190> here<00:05:04.550> I'll<00:05:05.120> show<00:05:05.300> you<00:05:05.479> what

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:21.129 
specific direction where the arrows
point<00:05:18.080> if<00:05:18.800> you<00:05:19.610> actually<00:05:19.820> end<00:05:20.330> up<00:05:20.510> just

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:21.139 
point if you actually end up just

00:05:21.139 --> 00:05:22.810 
point if you actually end up just
putting<00:05:21.889> this<00:05:22.010> let's<00:05:22.280> see<00:05:22.370> if<00:05:22.430> we<00:05:22.520> can<00:05:22.639> place

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:22.820 
putting this let's see if we can place

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:25.240 
putting this let's see if we can place
this<00:05:22.970> flat<00:05:23.330> it'll<00:05:24.110> actually<00:05:24.289> speed<00:05:24.919> up<00:05:24.949> the

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:25.250 
this flat it'll actually speed up the

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:30.939 
this flat it'll actually speed up the
ball<00:05:25.460> so<00:05:25.820> it<00:05:26.060> keeps<00:05:26.750> momentum<00:05:27.380> going<00:05:27.610> and<00:05:29.949> so

00:05:30.939 --> 00:05:30.949 
ball so it keeps momentum going and so

00:05:30.949 --> 00:05:33.189 
ball so it keeps momentum going and so
there<00:05:31.639> you<00:05:31.820> see<00:05:32.000> it<00:05:32.210> shot<00:05:32.720> the<00:05:32.870> ball<00:05:32.990> pretty

00:05:33.189 --> 00:05:33.199 
there you see it shot the ball pretty

00:05:33.199 --> 00:05:36.580 
there you see it shot the ball pretty
high<00:05:33.470> but<00:05:33.970> basically<00:05:34.970> that's<00:05:35.240> the<00:05:36.139> game<00:05:36.349> right

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:36.590 
high but basically that's the game right

00:05:36.590 --> 00:05:38.770 
high but basically that's the game right
there<00:05:36.889> it's<00:05:37.070> pretty<00:05:37.340> simple<00:05:37.639> you<00:05:38.300> just<00:05:38.330> use

00:05:38.770 --> 00:05:38.780 
there it's pretty simple you just use

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:40.719 
there it's pretty simple you just use
