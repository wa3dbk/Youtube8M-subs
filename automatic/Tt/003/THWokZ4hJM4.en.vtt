00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:15.180
 normally in the north we have five 

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:17.970
 bus that goes to the 30 minutes in the 

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:21.539
 normal circuit so what we did 

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:23.160
 is that we added five buses for 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.740
 iron instead of going to 30 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.050
 minutes we pass to 15 minutes at will 

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.390
 pose everywhere at 15 minutes and we have 

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.560
 added another five buses so that 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.870
 which means that we reach 15 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:37.440
 buses at all times in the area 

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:38.730
 north we also added this side 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.890
 here shuttles for people who 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.720
 arrive from the north who parked their 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:45.810
 back everywhere in the city we have 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:47.400
 added shuttles from 6h to 18h two 

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:48.720
 green hands that go especially 

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:53.300
 in the center georges-vÃ©zina 

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:56.640
 so there are 20 more buses that are 

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:58.050
 on their network at all times we will 

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.630
 have two new long ones how that 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.660
 we're going to have four or five 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:06.299
 places and we will be able to carry with 

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.860
 people in difficulty 

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:09.960
 people to house people who have 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.570
 difficulty going through that 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.640
 will start today 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.280
 then August 5th is going to be there it's a test 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.530
 what is it going to do in the name of there 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.290
 since not so much choice in 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.580
 breads on saturday and sunday you 

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.659
 see on the internet 

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:31.200
 the clashes have also been prolonged 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:35.100
 and the link we made a link in the south 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:38.369

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.380
 CEGEP the university and the shopping center 

00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:42.450
 it was agreed yesterday that we would have a 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.119
 traffic plan but as a 

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.369
 together need a plan on the left a plan 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:49.500
 right it will not work and the 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:51.000
 same thing for communications the 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.130
 communications must be made 

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.020
 how to harmonize well is important 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:57.270
 if not who says the bridge and see the water says 

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.770
 no it is not true it does not work and in 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.380
 more is not there too is open is 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.900
 what everything is coordinated transport 

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.689
 all this for it to work but yesterday I 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:08.280
 consider at the meeting that it's done 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:11.009
 with organizations 

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:13.260
 it was well honest after preparing 

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:17.400
 our one for next week 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.670
 when to know how to open but what we 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.470
 we plan 

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:22.959
 is that next week when that 

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:25.420

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:27.340
 want to flip with his self then 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:29.470
 when he's going to have a water blocking it 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:31.239
 will not be able to cross everything 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.400
 anticipates that the problems there it's going to be 

00:02:31.239 --> 00:02:36.700
 other kinds of problems but where 

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:39.520

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:50.650
 difficult 

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:53.130
