to fly you want to try to get the

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:03.020 
to fly you want to try to get the
tricopter<00:01:01.829> as<00:01:02.039> level<00:01:02.399> as<00:01:02.489> you<00:01:02.609> can<00:01:02.820> because

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:03.030 
tricopter as level as you can because

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.700 
tricopter as level as you can because
when<00:01:03.300> you<00:01:03.420> arm<00:01:03.660> it<00:01:03.809> the<00:01:03.899> KK<00:01:04.199> board<00:01:04.379> will<00:01:04.500> use

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
when you arm it the KK board will use

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:06.380 
when you arm it the KK board will use
its<00:01:04.890> orientation<00:01:05.280> at<00:01:05.580> that<00:01:05.790> moment<00:01:05.970> to<00:01:06.240> know

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:06.390 
its orientation at that moment to know

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:07.940 
its orientation at that moment to know
where<00:01:06.510> the<00:01:06.600> horizon<00:01:06.750> is<00:01:07.110> you<00:01:07.590> don't<00:01:07.799> have<00:01:07.860> that

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:07.950 
where the horizon is you don't have that

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.410 
where the horizon is you don't have that
level<00:01:08.280> at<00:01:08.369> first<00:01:08.640> then<00:01:08.880> you<00:01:08.970> will<00:01:09.060> be<00:01:09.180> fighting

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:09.420 
level at first then you will be fighting

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:10.969 
level at first then you will be fighting
it<00:01:09.689> to<00:01:09.869> stay<00:01:10.080> level<00:01:10.380> as<00:01:10.530> it<00:01:10.680> thinks<00:01:10.950> that

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:10.979 
it to stay level as it thinks that

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.100 
it to stay level as it thinks that

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.660 
minute now we're going to arm the copter
the<00:01:34.350> first<00:01:34.590> step<00:01:34.740> in<00:01:34.860> doing<00:01:34.920> that<00:01:35.070> is<00:01:35.220> to<00:01:35.369> turn

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
the first step in doing that is to turn

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:38.719 
the first step in doing that is to turn
on<00:01:35.820> your<00:01:35.939> radio<00:01:36.380> now<00:01:37.380> we're<00:01:37.560> going<00:01:37.740> to<00:01:37.860> plug<00:01:38.400> in

00:01:38.719 --> 00:01:38.729 
on your radio now we're going to plug in

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:41.649 
on your radio now we're going to plug in
the<00:01:39.060> tricopter

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:41.659 

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:44.030 

wait<00:01:42.659> for<00:01:42.840> the<00:01:42.899> motors<00:01:43.140> and<00:01:43.259> chime<00:01:43.470> and<00:01:43.920> we're

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040 
wait for the motors and chime and we're

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.560 
wait for the motors and chime and we're
going<00:01:44.159> to<00:01:44.220> take<00:01:44.369> the<00:01:44.549> rudder<00:01:44.970> throttle<00:01:45.360> stick

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
going to take the rudder throttle stick

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.720 
going to take the rudder throttle stick
within<00:01:46.020> the<00:01:46.140> bottom<00:01:46.439> right<00:01:46.680> corner

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:47.730 
within the bottom right corner

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:49.430 
within the bottom right corner
wait<00:01:48.390> for<00:01:48.540> the<00:01:48.600> motor<00:01:48.780> to<00:01:48.840> chime<00:01:49.140> one<00:01:49.290> last

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:49.440 
wait for the motor to chime one last

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.700 
wait for the motor to chime one last
time<00:01:49.620> and<00:01:50.960> now<00:01:51.960> we're<00:01:52.140> gonna<00:01:52.260> run<00:01:52.470> up<00:01:52.530> the

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:52.710 
time and now we're gonna run up the

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:55.250 
time and now we're gonna run up the
motors<00:01:53.040> and<00:01:53.670> what<00:01:53.940> we're<00:01:54.090> looking<00:01:54.210> for<00:01:54.390> is<00:01:54.840> any

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:55.260 
motors and what we're looking for is any

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:56.720 
motors and what we're looking for is any
motors<00:01:55.650> that<00:01:55.770> are<00:01:55.830> spinning<00:01:56.040> faster<00:01:56.520> than

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:56.730 
motors that are spinning faster than

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:58.190 
motors that are spinning faster than
they<00:01:56.850> should<00:01:56.880> be<00:01:57.060> and<00:01:57.690> so<00:01:57.870> we're<00:01:58.020> going<00:01:58.140> to

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200 
they should be and so we're going to

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.980 
they should be and so we're going to
adjust<00:01:58.530> for<00:01:58.680> that<00:01:58.740> with<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.190> trim<00:01:59.780> it'll<00:02:00.780> just

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:00.990 
adjust for that with the trim it'll just

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:02.840 
adjust for that with the trim it'll just
make<00:02:01.080> it<00:02:01.140> easier<00:02:01.380> to<00:02:01.590> trim<00:02:01.920> in<00:02:02.070> the<00:02:02.160> air<00:02:02.280> when

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
make it easier to trim in the air when

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:05.120 
make it easier to trim in the air when
we<00:02:02.940> start<00:02:03.210> flying<00:02:03.440> to<00:02:04.440> take<00:02:04.620> off<00:02:04.800> slowly

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
we start flying to take off slowly

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.550 
we start flying to take off slowly
increase<00:02:05.550> the<00:02:05.700> throttle<00:02:05.910> up<00:02:06.720> until<00:02:07.230> they<00:02:07.410> try

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
increase the throttle up until they try

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.890

tricopter<00:04:46.380> what<00:04:46.860> I<00:04:46.890> recommend<00:04:47.430> is<00:04:47.610> starting

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:48.000 
tricopter what I recommend is starting

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.460 
tricopter what I recommend is starting
off<00:04:48.120> with<00:04:48.330> an<00:04:48.480> airplane<00:04:48.930> they're<00:04:49.110> easier<00:04:49.410> to

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:49.470 
off with an airplane they're easier to

00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:51.680 
off with an airplane they're easier to
fly<00:04:49.710> in<00:04:49.830> my<00:04:49.950> opinion<00:04:50.340> and<00:04:50.760> you<00:04:50.940> can<00:04:51.120> learn<00:04:51.480> how

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:51.690 
fly in my opinion and you can learn how

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:53.960 
fly in my opinion and you can learn how
to<00:04:51.720> use<00:04:51.900> lipos<00:04:52.350> EEOC's<00:04:52.860> and<00:04:53.100> motors<00:04:53.370> which<00:04:53.850> you

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:53.970 
to use lipos EEOC's and motors which you

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:55.670 
to use lipos EEOC's and motors which you
can<00:04:54.120> then<00:04:54.270> use<00:04:54.630> those<00:04:54.780> skills<00:04:55.020> to<00:04:55.200> building<00:04:55.620> a

00:04:55.670 --> 00:04:55.680 
can then use those skills to building a

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:58.040 
can then use those skills to building a
trike<00:04:55.890> comfort<00:04:56.160> in<00:04:56.250> the<00:04:56.310> future<00:04:56.750> for<00:04:57.750> those<00:04:57.930> of
