hey guys so the first thing I did was I

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:53.919

00:00:53.919 --> 00:00:53.929 
put my hair in a low ponytail but

00:00:53.929 --> 00:00:55.599 
put my hair in a low ponytail but
without<00:00:54.230> putting<00:00:54.440> a<00:00:54.649> rubber<00:00:54.829> band<00:00:55.069> in<00:00:55.219> it<00:00:55.399> and

00:00:55.609 --> 00:00:59.049 
without putting a rubber band in it and
then<00:00:56.600> I<00:00:56.629> brushed<00:00:57.079> it<00:00:57.289> through<00:00:57.589> and<00:00:57.890> then<00:00:58.729> I

00:00:59.049 --> 00:00:59.059 
then I brushed it through and then I

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:02.619 
then I brushed it through and then I
just<00:00:59.420> twisted<00:01:00.280> you<00:01:01.280> want<00:01:01.460> it<00:01:01.579> at<00:01:01.969> a<00:01:02.030> low<00:01:02.329> angle

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:02.629 
just twisted you want it at a low angle

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:04.689 
just twisted you want it at a low angle
before<00:01:03.199> you<00:01:03.559> twist<00:01:03.859> because<00:01:04.250> you're<00:01:04.519> going<00:01:04.640> to

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:04.699 
before you twist because you're going to

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:08.140 
before you twist because you're going to
twist<00:01:04.940> up<00:01:05.300> so<00:01:06.050> you<00:01:06.110> that<00:01:06.650> helps<00:01:07.010> to<00:01:07.250> cause<00:01:07.700> the

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:08.150 
twist up so you that helps to cause the

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.440 
twist up so you that helps to cause the
twisting<00:01:08.780> at<00:01:09.140> the<00:01:09.770> lowest<00:01:10.040> point<00:01:10.299> toward<00:01:11.299> your

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:11.450 
twisting at the lowest point toward your

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:14.530 
twisting at the lowest point toward your
neck<00:01:11.630> and<00:01:11.870> then<00:01:12.770> I<00:01:13.130> have<00:01:13.610> a<00:01:13.640> really<00:01:13.940> long<00:01:14.270> hair

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:14.540 
neck and then I have a really long hair

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.150 
neck and then I have a really long hair
so<00:01:14.810> I'm<00:01:14.930> just<00:01:15.110> twisting<00:01:15.530> all<00:01:15.680> the<00:01:15.770> way<00:01:15.860> through

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:16.160 
so I'm just twisting all the way through

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:17.710 
so I'm just twisting all the way through
and<00:01:16.460> then<00:01:16.640> I'm<00:01:16.730> going<00:01:16.850> to<00:01:16.910> be<00:01:17.060> tucking<00:01:17.480> this

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:17.720 
and then I'm going to be tucking this

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.400 
and then I'm going to be tucking this
under<00:01:18.230> and<00:01:18.790> I'm<00:01:19.790> going<00:01:20.120> to<00:01:20.330> tuck<00:01:21.050> tuck<00:01:21.380> tuck

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:24.320 
and I'm lifting up the hair on the side

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.190 
and I'm lifting up the hair on the side
to<00:01:24.950> kind<00:01:25.190> of<00:01:25.250> form<00:01:25.640> it<00:01:25.820> and<00:01:26.060> shape<00:01:26.420> it<00:01:26.660> into<00:01:26.900> a

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:27.200 
to kind of form it and shape it into a

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.060 
to kind of form it and shape it into a
French<00:01:27.620> twist<00:01:27.920> and<00:01:29.350> this<00:01:30.350> is<00:01:30.500> a<00:01:30.530> really<00:01:30.860> simple

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:31.070 
French twist and this is a really simple

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.850 
French twist and this is a really simple

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:33.860 
but it matters how much hair that the

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.710 
but it matters how much hair that the
shorter<00:01:34.190> your<00:01:34.430> hair<00:01:34.640> is<00:01:34.820> the<00:01:35.180> easier<00:01:35.570> it<00:01:35.630> will

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:35.720 
shorter your hair is the easier it will
