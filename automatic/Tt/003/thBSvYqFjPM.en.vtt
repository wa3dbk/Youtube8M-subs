00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:10.639
 with all more school peace schools for more than ten years are the tubes of 

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:12.409
 plos one light 

00:00:12.409 --> 00:00:16.370
 which is a system are very efficient and simple to transport 

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:17.720
 Sun rays 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:22.010
 to dark spaces as providence rhode cellars exports where they have not 

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:26.079
 tempted through seemingly conventional skylights which 

00:00:26.079 --> 00:00:29.470
 has been introduced to the latest technologies in what is design 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:32.060
 and also materials we achieve this goal 

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:36.500
 it's about bringing natural light inside the buildings but cd with 

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.800
 the minutes towers and tectonics we look for an integration of the building 

00:00:40.589 --> 00:00:43.809
 that almost in the opening alternates not twelve months 

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.710
 argued that what we consisted composed of four parts the first 

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:52.740
 it's the downtown area arises its system based on a stellar wind duo with 

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:54.400
 an anti-compensation camera 

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:58.650
 the prosecutions and integrated into it is generosity with technology 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:00.610
 of prcel which is what allows us 

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:03.800
 escape and increase the levels of illumination of the data 

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:06.730
 the second apart are the sockets 

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:09.810
 is the piece that acts as a link between the roof of the building 

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:13.940
 and this one skylight that the celestial ones previously to be able to take the 

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.090
 asphalt fabrics in interpretations the third step is they are 

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.850
 the light tubes with aluminum conduits the high aluminum 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.450
 reflectance 98 percent completely metallic base 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.590
 They are not laminated in plastic, which allows us to transmit a lot of light 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.970
 plans or time maintain what is the quality and performance of aluminum 

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:35.740
 during many and finally diffuse what it does is close to 

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.680
 that is in a sealed system and at the same time make and dissemination of this 

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.570
 this ray of light that we have and others carrying is through the tube in space 

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:46.070
 mitation that we are trying to imitate 

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:49.690
 in this person we have bet from the beginning for the muleteers to own 

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:52.780
 technology but follow the standards in the brand cable 

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.620
 initially we developed the protile trilogy 

00:01:55.620 --> 00:01:59.140
 on your side of cancerology solar capture of the world that still being 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.080
 static allows them to adapt to the movement rooms in winter and we arrived 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.970
 up to double the lighting levels that we would achieve with a 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:10.580
 traditional dome but changed in summer we managed to protect at the levels 

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.460
 of lighting that protects from the heat on all that yes our maximum 

00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:16.910
 enemy in summer the second big technology section is the one that most in 

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:20.739
 which we do not have to use plastics our system 

00:02:21.339 --> 00:02:22.399
 catchment 

00:02:22.399 --> 00:02:25.499
 and with this we contribute with the advantages of being in an old man with the 

00:02:25.499 --> 00:02:29.409
 over time the myrtles with which the management of water and dust 

00:02:30.159 --> 00:02:33.859
 outside a building never fails day the glass that in turn yes that what 

00:02:33.859 --> 00:02:37.829
 can make as a betrayal of plastic the fact of having an island camera before 

00:02:37.829 --> 00:02:40.989
 what allows us to achieve levels of thermal insulation as well as 

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:41.899
 acoustic 

00:02:41.899 --> 00:02:45.629
 impossible to achieve with any traditional system issues before their 

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:47.500
 systems have a ventilation 

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.900
 And finally it would be thanks to the application of laminates in 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:52.719
 crystals 

00:02:52.719 --> 00:02:53.989
 we can have 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:57.980
 having drivers or that are passable we get to step on both 

00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:58.869
 pedestrians 

00:02:58.869 --> 00:03:03.889
 as even by trucks and 11 positions the third great reference we want that 

00:03:03.889 --> 00:03:07.749
 be always levitate the plastic in the two conduits of 

00:03:07.749 --> 00:03:10.499
 air therefore we have faced for mine 

00:03:10.499 --> 00:03:14.019
 yes because metallic polokwane our system does not degrade with the passage of 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:18.189
 time and has the same performance in year 1 that within this port in 

00:03:18.189 --> 00:03:22.019
 the last big bet has been the American certification that the one of the tuc 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:26.189
 ravel that what you do gives a more global meaning let's say this 

00:03:26.189 --> 00:03:30.469
 figure for sustainability not so much in the application of the product itself 

00:03:30.469 --> 00:03:31.999
 yes no manufacturing 

00:03:31.999 --> 00:03:35.349
 not being harmful to the environment these manufacturing processes 

00:03:36.039 --> 00:03:36.639
 the Copts
