00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:06.769 
just about everybody I know uses a

00:00:06.769 --> 00:00:09.430 
just about everybody I know uses a
circular<00:00:07.250> saw<00:00:07.460> to<00:00:07.729> cut<00:00:07.939> wood<00:00:08.240> but<00:00:08.930> a<00:00:08.990> lot<00:00:09.290> of

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:09.440 
circular saw to cut wood but a lot of

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:10.869 
circular saw to cut wood but a lot of
times<00:00:09.650> they<00:00:09.799> struggle<00:00:10.280> with<00:00:10.309> it<00:00:10.549> because

00:00:10.869 --> 00:00:10.879 
times they struggle with it because

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:13.150 
times they struggle with it because
maybe<00:00:11.059> the<00:00:11.299> wood<00:00:11.510> splinters<00:00:12.139> or<00:00:12.410> you<00:00:12.860> can't

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:13.160 
maybe the wood splinters or you can't

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.730 
maybe the wood splinters or you can't
keep<00:00:13.400> a<00:00:13.549> straight<00:00:13.849> line<00:00:14.150> as<00:00:14.450> you<00:00:14.570> cut<00:00:14.900> well<00:00:15.559> I'm

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:15.740 
keep a straight line as you cut well I'm

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:17.560 
keep a straight line as you cut well I'm
going<00:00:15.950> to<00:00:15.980> show<00:00:16.219> you<00:00:16.279> some<00:00:16.580> tricks<00:00:16.880> today<00:00:17.060> it's

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:17.570 
going to show you some tricks today it's

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:19.300 
going to show you some tricks today it's
going<00:00:17.689> to<00:00:17.750> turn<00:00:18.020> you<00:00:18.290> into<00:00:18.529> a<00:00:18.680> professional

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:19.310 
going to turn you into a professional

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:21.070 
going to turn you into a professional
the<00:00:20.029> first<00:00:20.330> thing<00:00:20.510> you<00:00:20.600> need<00:00:20.779> to<00:00:20.810> know<00:00:20.960> about

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:21.080 
the first thing you need to know about

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.920 
the first thing you need to know about
circular<00:00:21.619> saws<00:00:21.890> is<00:00:22.189> which<00:00:22.820> way<00:00:23.240> the<00:00:23.599> blade

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:23.930 
circular saws is which way the blade

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:25.660 
circular saws is which way the blade
rotates<00:00:24.260> I<00:00:24.800> know<00:00:25.099> you're<00:00:25.369> thinking<00:00:25.640> that

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:25.670 
rotates I know you're thinking that

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:26.919 
rotates I know you're thinking that
doesn't<00:00:25.970> make<00:00:26.060> sense<00:00:26.119> but<00:00:26.420> I'll<00:00:26.510> show<00:00:26.660> you<00:00:26.689> why

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:26.929 
doesn't make sense but I'll show you why

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:29.769 
doesn't make sense but I'll show you why
most<00:00:27.920> circular<00:00:28.310> saw<00:00:28.519> blades<00:00:28.849> rotate<00:00:29.539> this

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:29.779 
most circular saw blades rotate this

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:32.409 
most circular saw blades rotate this
direction<00:00:30.349> so<00:00:31.099> that<00:00:31.250> the<00:00:31.369> blade<00:00:31.670> is<00:00:31.699> cutting

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:32.419 
direction so that the blade is cutting

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:34.509 
direction so that the blade is cutting
up<00:00:32.629> towards<00:00:33.230> you<00:00:33.379> as<00:00:33.559> the<00:00:33.830> front<00:00:34.160> of<00:00:34.250> the<00:00:34.309> blade

00:00:34.509 --> 00:00:34.519 
up towards you as the front of the blade

00:00:34.519 --> 00:00:37.030 
up towards you as the front of the blade
moves<00:00:35.120> through<00:00:35.480> the<00:00:35.600> wood<00:00:35.780> here's<00:00:36.649> why<00:00:36.860> it's

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:37.040 
moves through the wood here's why it's

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:38.500 
moves through the wood here's why it's
important<00:00:37.430> to<00:00:37.489> know<00:00:37.579> which<00:00:37.790> way<00:00:38.000> that<00:00:38.180> saw

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:38.510 
important to know which way that saw

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:40.869 
important to know which way that saw
blade<00:00:38.540> spins<00:00:39.140> look<00:00:39.829> at<00:00:39.980> this<00:00:40.129> piece<00:00:40.399> of<00:00:40.430> wood

00:00:40.869 --> 00:00:40.879 
blade spins look at this piece of wood

00:00:40.879 --> 00:00:43.779 
blade spins look at this piece of wood
you<00:00:41.840> can<00:00:42.020> see<00:00:42.260> the<00:00:42.440> graining<00:00:42.950> in<00:00:43.039> the<00:00:43.129> wood<00:00:43.340> the

00:00:43.779 --> 00:00:43.789 
you can see the graining in the wood the

00:00:43.789 --> 00:00:46.869 
you can see the graining in the wood the
grain<00:00:44.120> runs<00:00:44.629> this<00:00:45.140> direction<00:00:45.770> so<00:00:46.550> if<00:00:46.700> I'm

00:00:46.869 --> 00:00:46.879 
grain runs this direction so if I'm

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:49.150 
grain runs this direction so if I'm
cutting<00:00:47.360> parallel<00:00:47.989> with<00:00:48.140> the<00:00:48.230> grain<00:00:48.469> I'm<00:00:48.949> not

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:49.160 
cutting parallel with the grain I'm not

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:50.319 
cutting parallel with the grain I'm not
going<00:00:49.280> to<00:00:49.370> have<00:00:49.460> too<00:00:49.610> many<00:00:49.760> problems<00:00:50.059> with

00:00:50.319 --> 00:00:50.329 
going to have too many problems with

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:52.630 
going to have too many problems with
splintering<00:00:50.930> but<00:00:51.379> if<00:00:51.500> I<00:00:51.649> decide<00:00:52.039> to<00:00:52.070> cut<00:00:52.430> this

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:52.640 
splintering but if I decide to cut this

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:54.939 
splintering but if I decide to cut this
piece<00:00:52.850> of<00:00:53.030> wood<00:00:53.180> this<00:00:53.539> direction<00:00:54.230> I'm<00:00:54.739> going

00:00:54.939 --> 00:00:54.949 
piece of wood this direction I'm going

00:00:54.949 --> 00:00:56.770 
piece of wood this direction I'm going
to<00:00:55.039> have<00:00:55.190> big<00:00:55.520> problems<00:00:55.550> unless<00:00:56.390> I<00:00:56.539> take<00:00:56.719> a

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:56.780 
to have big problems unless I take a

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:58.420 
to have big problems unless I take a
couple<00:00:57.079> of<00:00:57.199> steps<00:00:57.440> look<00:00:58.070> at<00:00:58.160> all<00:00:58.280> those

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:58.430 
couple of steps look at all those

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:00.160 
couple of steps look at all those
splinters<00:00:58.910> what<00:00:59.359> a<00:00:59.390> mess<00:00:59.660> I'm<00:00:59.840> going<00:00:59.989> to<00:01:00.050> show

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:00.170 
splinters what a mess I'm going to show

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:02.170 
splinters what a mess I'm going to show
you<00:01:00.260> how<00:01:00.320> to<00:01:00.410> avoid<00:01:00.590> that<00:01:00.800> the<00:01:01.520> thing<00:01:01.850> I<00:01:01.969> like

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:02.180 
you how to avoid that the thing I like

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.499 
you how to avoid that the thing I like
to<00:01:02.300> do<00:01:02.480> is<00:01:02.769> cut<00:01:03.769> along<00:01:04.070> the<00:01:04.670> line<00:01:04.910> where<00:01:05.360> you're

00:01:05.499 --> 00:01:05.509 
to do is cut along the line where you're

00:01:05.509 --> 00:01:07.770 
to do is cut along the line where you're
going<00:01:05.630> to<00:01:05.690> cut<00:01:05.960> with<00:01:06.200> a<00:01:06.229> razor<00:01:06.500> knife<00:01:06.920> and

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:07.780 
going to cut with a razor knife and

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:12.669 
going to cut with a razor knife and
actually<00:01:08.780> pre<00:01:09.170> score<00:01:09.590> that<00:01:09.830> grain<00:01:10.190> and<00:01:11.679> then

00:01:12.669 --> 00:01:12.679 
actually pre score that grain and then

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:15.960 
actually pre score that grain and then
when<00:01:12.860> you<00:01:12.950> cut<00:01:13.250> with<00:01:13.399> a<00:01:13.490> saw<00:01:13.729> cut<00:01:14.179> slowly

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:15.970 
when you cut with a saw cut slowly

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:18.490 
when you cut with a saw cut slowly
notice<00:01:16.970> on<00:01:17.119> this<00:01:17.390> side<00:01:17.660> of<00:01:17.690> the<00:01:17.840> line<00:01:18.080> there's

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:18.500 
notice on this side of the line there's

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.040 
notice on this side of the line there's
no<00:01:18.770> splitting<00:01:19.190> but<00:01:19.729> over<00:01:20.000> here<00:01:20.300> where<00:01:20.750> the<00:01:20.869> saw

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:21.050 
no splitting but over here where the saw

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:23.350 
no splitting but over here where the saw
blade<00:01:21.349> wasn't<00:01:21.830> against<00:01:22.190> a<00:01:22.340> cut<00:01:22.550> line<00:01:22.759> you<00:01:23.179> can

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360 
blade wasn't against a cut line you can

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:24.880 
blade wasn't against a cut line you can
see<00:01:23.509> the<00:01:23.630> splinters<00:01:24.020> that<00:01:24.170> I<00:01:24.229> got<00:01:24.410> over<00:01:24.619> here

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
see the splinters that I got over here

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:26.980 
see the splinters that I got over here
the<00:01:25.429> final<00:01:25.819> thing<00:01:25.970> I'd<00:01:26.119> like<00:01:26.270> to<00:01:26.420> show<00:01:26.599> you<00:01:26.660> is

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:26.990 
the final thing I'd like to show you is

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:29.249 
the final thing I'd like to show you is
how<00:01:27.229> to<00:01:27.289> cut<00:01:27.679> curves<00:01:28.130> with<00:01:28.700> a<00:01:28.729> circular<00:01:29.209> saw

00:01:29.249 --> 00:01:29.259 
how to cut curves with a circular saw

00:01:29.259 --> 00:01:31.660 
how to cut curves with a circular saw
really<00:01:30.259> simple<00:01:30.619> first<00:01:31.220> thing<00:01:31.369> you<00:01:31.459> need<00:01:31.550> to

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670 
really simple first thing you need to

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.309 
really simple first thing you need to
know<00:01:31.819> is<00:01:32.000> what's<00:01:32.360> the<00:01:32.479> thickness<00:01:33.020> of<00:01:33.229> the

00:01:33.309 --> 00:01:33.319 
know is what's the thickness of the

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:35.229 
know is what's the thickness of the
material<00:01:33.440> you're<00:01:33.950> cutting<00:01:34.340> through<00:01:34.520> this<00:01:35.030> is

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:35.239 
material you're cutting through this is

00:01:35.239 --> 00:01:37.359 
material you're cutting through this is
like<00:01:35.390> half-inch<00:01:35.840> plywood<00:01:36.110> but<00:01:36.890> look<00:01:37.130> at<00:01:37.250> the

00:01:37.359 --> 00:01:37.369 
like half-inch plywood but look at the

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:39.609 
like half-inch plywood but look at the
way<00:01:37.459> the<00:01:37.610> saw<00:01:37.849> set<00:01:38.209> up<00:01:38.330> right<00:01:38.509> now<00:01:38.720> look<00:01:39.470> how

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:39.619 
way the saw set up right now look how

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:41.770 
way the saw set up right now look how
deep<00:01:39.920> it's<00:01:40.130> cutting<00:01:40.520> the<00:01:40.670> trick<00:01:41.030> is<00:01:41.239> to<00:01:41.509> adjust

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:41.780 
deep it's cutting the trick is to adjust

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.710 
deep it's cutting the trick is to adjust
the<00:01:42.229> depth<00:01:42.619> of<00:01:42.800> the<00:01:42.890> cut<00:01:43.130> so<00:01:43.729> that<00:01:43.759> it's<00:01:44.119> just<00:01:44.270> a
