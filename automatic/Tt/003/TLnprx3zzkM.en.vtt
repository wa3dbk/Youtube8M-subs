00:00:57.750 --> 00:00:57.760 
um if it was straightened it probably be

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.360 
um if it was straightened it probably be
20<00:00:57.880> inches<00:00:58.180> but<00:00:58.690> because<00:00:59.470> it's<00:00:59.620> not<00:00:59.829> it's<00:01:00.070> more

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:00.370 
20 inches but because it's not it's more

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:02.729 
20 inches but because it's not it's more
around<00:01:00.670> 18<00:01:01.090> inches<00:01:01.480> also<00:01:02.079> the<00:01:02.200> wig<00:01:02.350> came<00:01:02.530> with

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:02.739 
around 18 inches also the wig came with

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:05.039 
around 18 inches also the wig came with
three<00:01:02.950> combs<00:01:03.250> and<00:01:03.579> an<00:01:04.089> adjustable<00:01:04.390> strap<00:01:04.929> in

00:01:05.039 --> 00:01:05.049 
three combs and an adjustable strap in

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:06.450 
three combs and an adjustable strap in
the<00:01:05.109> back<00:01:05.170> so<00:01:05.560> there's<00:01:05.740> one<00:01:05.950> comb<00:01:06.189> in<00:01:06.369> the

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:06.460 
the back so there's one comb in the

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:08.639 
the back so there's one comb in the
front<00:01:06.729> and<00:01:06.909> two<00:01:07.450> on<00:01:07.630> the<00:01:07.780> sides<00:01:07.990> right<00:01:08.350> here

00:01:08.639 --> 00:01:08.649 
front and two on the sides right here

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:10.950 
front and two on the sides right here
and<00:01:08.859> then<00:01:09.249> the<00:01:09.520> bang<00:01:09.759> actually<00:01:10.390> this<00:01:10.569> piece<00:01:10.840> of

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:10.960 
and then the bang actually this piece of

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:13.200 
and then the bang actually this piece of
the<00:01:11.049> bang<00:01:11.200> actually<00:01:11.799> went<00:01:12.069> with<00:01:12.219> this<00:01:12.369> one<00:01:12.429> so

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:13.210 
the bang actually went with this one so

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:14.190 
the bang actually went with this one so
it<00:01:13.299> kind<00:01:13.509> of<00:01:13.569> gave<00:01:13.689> it<00:01:13.840> more<00:01:13.990> of<00:01:14.079> an

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:14.200 
it kind of gave it more of an

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.649 
it kind of gave it more of an
overlapping<00:01:14.770> bang<00:01:15.189> but<00:01:15.850> I<00:01:15.880> actually<00:01:16.119> didn't

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:16.659 
overlapping bang but I actually didn't

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:18.419 
overlapping bang but I actually didn't
like<00:01:16.810> how<00:01:17.049> it<00:01:17.109> was<00:01:17.259> just<00:01:17.499> too<00:01:17.829> much<00:01:18.069> hair<00:01:18.399> I

00:01:18.419 --> 00:01:18.429 
like how it was just too much hair I

00:01:18.429 --> 00:01:20.370 
like how it was just too much hair I
felt<00:01:18.729> like<00:01:18.819> on<00:01:18.999> one<00:01:19.179> side<00:01:19.479> so<00:01:20.139> I<00:01:20.170> actually

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:20.380 
felt like on one side so I actually

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:21.929 
felt like on one side so I actually
pulled<00:01:20.710> a<00:01:20.829> piece<00:01:20.950> of<00:01:21.009> the<00:01:21.159> bag<00:01:21.340> and<00:01:21.579> put<00:01:21.819> it

00:01:21.929 --> 00:01:21.939 
pulled a piece of the bag and put it

00:01:21.939 --> 00:01:24.389 
pulled a piece of the bag and put it
over<00:01:22.060> here<00:01:22.539> but<00:01:23.289> it<00:01:23.530> still<00:01:23.799> looks<00:01:23.829> good<00:01:24.189> either

00:01:24.389 --> 00:01:24.399 
over here but it still looks good either

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:26.730 
over here but it still looks good either
way<00:01:24.579> and<00:01:25.090> this<00:01:25.359> is<00:01:25.479> how<00:01:25.600> the<00:01:25.659> top<00:01:25.990> looks<00:01:26.289> so<00:01:26.649> you

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:26.740 
way and this is how the top looks so you

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.529 
way and this is how the top looks so you
really<00:01:27.069> don't<00:01:27.159> get<00:01:27.340> apart<00:01:27.789> it's<00:01:28.060> kind<00:01:28.329> of<00:01:28.450> like

00:01:28.529 --> 00:01:28.539 
really don't get apart it's kind of like

00:01:28.539 --> 00:01:31.289 
really don't get apart it's kind of like
hair<00:01:28.929> overlapping<00:01:29.499> the<00:01:29.889> other<00:01:30.130> part<00:01:30.520> but<00:01:31.209> you

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:31.299 
hair overlapping the other part but you

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:33.359 
hair overlapping the other part but you
don't<00:01:31.479> really<00:01:31.630> see<00:01:31.959> like<00:01:31.990> a<00:01:32.499> part<00:01:33.069> where<00:01:33.219> you

00:01:33.359 --> 00:01:33.369 
don't really see like a part where you

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:35.999 
don't really see like a part where you
can<00:01:33.579> part<00:01:34.209> like<00:01:34.509> how<00:01:34.749> it's<00:01:35.049> black<00:01:35.409> right<00:01:35.649> here

00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:36.009 
can part like how it's black right here

goes<00:03:07.600> back<00:03:07.870> to<00:03:08.080> looking<00:03:08.410> normal<00:03:08.680> but<00:03:09.400> it<00:03:09.520> can

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
goes back to looking normal but it can

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.960 
goes back to looking normal but it can
have<00:03:10.000> like<00:03:10.270> a<00:03:10.480> light<00:03:11.020> frizz<00:03:11.680> we're<00:03:12.010> like<00:03:12.250> stray

have like a light frizz we're like stray

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.030 
have like a light frizz we're like stray
hairs<00:03:13.330> are<00:03:13.600> out<00:03:13.900> so<00:03:14.530> all<00:03:14.590> you<00:03:14.680> gotta<00:03:14.860> do<00:03:15.010> is

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:15.040 
hairs are out so all you gotta do is

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.560 
hairs are out so all you gotta do is
just<00:03:15.250> comb<00:03:15.490> it<00:03:15.520> and<00:03:15.820> then<00:03:15.940> do<00:03:16.120> like<00:03:16.270> that<00:03:16.480> with

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:16.570 
just comb it and then do like that with

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:17.820 
just comb it and then do like that with
your<00:03:16.690> finger<00:03:16.930> and<00:03:16.990> it<00:03:17.080> goes<00:03:17.230> right<00:03:17.320> back<00:03:17.620> but

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:17.830 
your finger and it goes right back but

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:19.320 
your finger and it goes right back but
yeah<00:03:17.950> I<00:03:18.010> think<00:03:18.100> this<00:03:18.340> is<00:03:18.400> a<00:03:18.550> really<00:03:18.850> good<00:03:19.120> wig

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:21.400 
for it to be synthetic because it's not

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:23.250
