00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:30.150
 hi montoneros and balconeras I'm josema 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:32.340
 source and this is that it's good mania the 

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:33.840
 today's mania test comes and one of the 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:36.900
 leading market brands 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:40.400
 Mérida, second world manufacturer of 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:45.510
 bicycles that always has bicycles 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:49.350
 with a reliability premise apart from being 

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:51.479
 tremendously effective is the brand of 

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.470
 our jose antonio hermida who bears 

00:00:51.479 --> 00:00:55.620
 already a lot of years giving us 

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:58.650
 satisfactions 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:01.140
 year after year little by little they go 

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:03.780
 defining the wheel standards 29 

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:08.040
 inches for rally bikes and 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:09.900
 27 and a half marathon as you do not pay the 

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.530
 mountain like the one we have here today in 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:16.370
 the ratio and the 26 inches 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:18.950
 definitely for the descent 

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:23.030
 that the manufacturers little by little go 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:25.090
 introducing the wheel of 27 and a half in 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:27.759
 the great routes 

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:30.549
 on a bicycle that is mostly 

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:34.299
 ready to have fun lowering the 

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:36.729
 box is a really important part 

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:38.829
 the construction that you have opted here in 

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:41.590
 mérida is aluminum and bearing 

00:01:38.829 --> 00:01:45.250
 using so many years and with such good 

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:47.770
 toned results gone formed with 

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:51.369
 perfectly defined welds 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:54.009
 and that give a really strong solidity 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:58.720
 at critical points they are like the pipa 

00:01:54.009 --> 00:02:01.190
 of the management as well as a reinforcement in 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:05.060
 the bottom bracket 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:10.780
 where the damper is lodged 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:10.780
 and the violet in the saddle tube 

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:17.900
 the system that employs Mérida is 

00:02:14.629 --> 00:02:19.760
 virtual pivot we see that there is the 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.130
 rear triangle formed by the 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:25.040
 braces and pods 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:27.260
 in this case adhered to the triangle 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.960
 Main tube diagonal tube 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:34.180
 top and the seat post by 

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:34.180
 two violets one at the bottom 

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:40.360
 and a big violet on the top 

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:44.430
 which is what gives life to the 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.430
 shock absorber to be used thoroughly 

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:50.849
 reinforced we see here with an X 

00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:03.670
 that gives the back a 

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:08.050
 really extraordinary sensitivity 

00:03:03.670 --> 00:03:10.710
 some bearings really sealed 

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:15.150
 oversized 

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:19.860
 give us an idea of the robustness and 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:23.240
 reliability of this the mountain of mérida 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:26.600
 to give sensitivity to this system 

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:29.520
 tremendously effective of merida fox 

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:34.670
 is behind the suspensions both in 

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:34.670
 The shock absorber with the fox trot etc 

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:44.019
 as with the fork is the 150 

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:47.210
 millimeters of travel also the 

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:52.550
 ctd system 

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:55.580
 klym traction descent through shaft 

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:58.580
 on the 15-millimeter front wheel and 

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:02.830
 for the rear of 12 millimeters in this 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:06.820
 case for a bushing and wheels 

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:06.820
 sanz groin 

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:15.200
 and in particular of the English blood is the 

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:18.620
 charter model with 28 radios in your life 

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:21.970
 back and on your front wheel a roll 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:21.970
 that looks like celestial music 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:31.930
 and a robustness proof of what is 

00:04:27.409 --> 00:04:31.930
 deserves a mountain bike 

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:39.120
 flex to what is necessary in the supports 

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:41.520
 strong when we change rhythm or 

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:43.770
 when we perform those jumps that both 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:45.810
 we like them and the weight that has given in 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:51.510
 our scale is 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:53.370
 13 kilos 640 grams pedals included in 

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:56.040
 As for the transmission, they have not 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:59.610
 played absolute reliability gap not 

00:04:56.040 --> 00:05:02.130
 exists in full and in my opinion a 

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:06.120
 separate chapter deserve the brakes 

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:11.669
 also make your hand and also 

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:14.520
 the x's of absolute modularity so much for 

00:05:11.669 --> 00:05:17.070
 leave as when approaching the handle of very 

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:21.180
 easy to drive and what you want me 

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:23.610
 say do not fail the power never seems 

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:26.700
 that never ends also and from 

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:29.190
 then they are the brakes that today 

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:30.419
 they are the reference in the market together 

00:05:29.190 --> 00:05:33.060
 with his older brother 

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:35.490
 the xtra on the bikes there 

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:38.460
 mountain is really important to have 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:40.889
 great manageability and for this it has 

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:46.380
 opted for a handlebar of the brand 

00:05:40.889 --> 00:05:48.620
 efe s / a 74 cm wide 

00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:51.060
 this will allow us to have control 

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:53.120
 really remarkable when it comes to driving 

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:56.000
 the bike 

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:57.800
 a very short power of 4 

00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:01.040
 centimeters of the brand itself 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:03.490
 efe s / a a seatpost of the own brand 

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:03.490
 Merida 

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:13.560
 and a really comfortable saddle as is the 

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:17.310
 ex cracks x 14 black in this 

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:20.730
 case in short is the mountain of 

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:24.540
 measure has reminded us because we like it 

00:06:20.730 --> 00:06:27.450
 and we are passionate about this sport 27 inches 

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:29.520
 and half the fashion wheel that has 

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:32.760
 come and has settled definitively 

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:36.150
 in this segment it has given an air of 

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:39.240
 renewal that of course he needed and 

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:42.050
 we as users appreciate it 

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:42.050
 enormously 

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:49.740
 this measure has everything scale and low 

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:53.750
 like an authentic missile josema source and 

00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:53.750
 see you in a next test mania
