00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:14.019
 hello all guys be of the 

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:16.270
 staff of fetal ultimatives are here with 

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:19.720
 the german denis inform player 

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:21.669
 Argentinian player of the haldanta has 

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:23.890
 scored twice in the match 

00:00:21.669 --> 00:00:25.660
 of the atanta against the Cesena the 

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:29.050
 consequently received this subversion 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:31.239
 informs the goal on a nice overturn 

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:34.570
 player shows up with this card 

00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:37.570
 with 67 of speed 85 of tivo 60 of 

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:41.680
 pass 73 of dreaming 33 of defense e 

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:44.289
 75 of physical 

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:46.539
 then what kind of player is he is 

00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:50.320
 old-fashioned center forward a 

00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:55.149
 striker thrown there to try to 

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:57.519
 pull over the last 11 10 98 meters and for 

00:00:55.149 --> 00:00:59.800
 try to throw it of head of 

00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:02.710
 consequently it is not the center forward is not 

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:05.440
 the player for this game will not be 

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:08.140
 poorly negligent but neither is he 

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:11.200
 remotely indeed the speed is 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:14.250
 definitely the pros and cons 

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:17.140
 sorry for the cross the more 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:21.610
 important the most decisive against the 

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:25.060
 against most unfortunately also more negative 

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:27.009
 then 64 speed acceleration 70 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.329
 click are values ​​of the whole 

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:31.479
 truthful 

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:34.000
 don't think with him to take the ball of 

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:36.189
 discard all or take speak in 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.079
 even in the open field without many 

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:39.840
 opponents and being able to get in 

00:01:38.079 --> 00:01:41.710
 brings it so easily 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.189
 in fact in the first games he has it 

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:49.689
 used as a unique tip and it was 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:52.420
 to use a disastrous euphemism in 

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:54.159
 tip we say to each other with another 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.799
 striker faster than he as tevez 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:58.210
 if she got a little better just because 

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:00.030
 the other attacker was able to 

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:03.039
 create the spaces it needs to 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:06.189
 pulling is because it manages to serve for 

00:02:03.039 --> 00:02:08.560
 well then the speed of the whole 

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:11.260
 negative agility obviously going more 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.620
 or less coupled to speed 62 on 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:15.670
 paper is really scarce 

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.010
 the only positive thing about this 

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:20.440
 player and the shot in the air again 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:22.810
 89 of finalization that is not heard 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:23.909
 so much is not a 89 for anything I have to 

00:02:22.810 --> 00:02:28.659
 to say 

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:31.810
 in reality it may seem like a 78 or a 79 80 

00:02:28.659 --> 00:02:34.540
 however it is not however a very good 86 of 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:37.180
 in fact , power shots are enhanced 

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:39.010
 inside the area are the best is an 82 of 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.650
 tv on the fly the other tv that go 

00:02:39.010 --> 00:02:43.629
 definitely good so only throws of 

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.700
 power and shots on the fly inside the area 

00:02:43.629 --> 00:02:50.319
 because the log choc 71 feels fin 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:54.069
 too far too badly from a distance 

00:02:50.319 --> 00:02:57.430
 in particular the 72 rounds again 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:59.349
 poorer then just negative 

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:02.049
 yes the shot is the only good thing but 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:05.409
 not even all kinds of shots here 

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:06.159
 all kinds of shots is something else 

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:09.609
 positive 

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:12.090
 just to mention it and physical strength 86 

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:15.849
 on the other hand if you take him you know he has 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:19.530
 good physical strength is therefore more successful 

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:22.359
 or less to manage well let's say i 

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:25.060
 contrasts with opposing defenders but 

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:27.849
 then consider a balance of 74 

00:03:25.060 --> 00:03:30.310
 it is indeed a negative value then 

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:32.259
 it's not even a tank that succeeds 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:34.900
 to resist just everything resists but 

00:03:32.259 --> 00:03:36.519
 not very much 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:39.609
 for the rest, only negative values 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:43.229
 dribbling 71 with two-star skill is 

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:45.519
 just unwatchable when playing 

00:03:43.229 --> 00:03:48.129
 very few statistics 

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:49.709
 I repeat a good 90 of speed 

00:03:48.129 --> 00:03:52.299
 otherwise we would miss positioning 

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:55.090
 practically stoned thrown in front of it 

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:56.979
 with a normal normal of wordpress three 

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:58.750
 weak foot stars that all feel 

00:03:56.979 --> 00:04:01.169
 and pulls well just right practically 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:05.169
 on the left, take your own hand 

00:04:01.169 --> 00:04:07.780
 therefore consequently you have understood one 

00:04:05.169 --> 00:04:09.310
 totally negative player altogether 

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:12.610
 negative 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:14.410
 I only forgot the jump head 88 

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:16.030
 precision head 

00:04:14.410 --> 00:04:17.500
 I certainly don't have good values 

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:20.049
 found as in game because not 

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.739
 I'm one who plays a lot of cross and blow 

00:04:20.049 --> 00:04:23.950
 of head 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:27.010
 so I repeat a player completely 

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:30.310
 negative ok the price is very low 

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:33.270
 ten thousand ten thousand for an iv is the minimum 

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:36.490
 but it is useless to throw 10,000 critics if 

00:04:33.270 --> 00:04:38.980
 you want a series striker with 

00:04:36.490 --> 00:04:40.990
 3000 and 4000 2000 you buy higuain a 

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:43.360
 this point you buy tevez you buy 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:44.740
 lots of players stronger than him though 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.870
 you really want a player with these 

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:48.490
 features 

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:51.010
 take a right a crazy that 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:54.639
 maybe I'm even a bit quicker 

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:56.229
 but guys are wasted ones credits 

00:04:54.639 --> 00:04:58.240
 who spend if for this player a 

00:04:56.229 --> 00:05:00.580
 Unless you are his fan fans 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:02.889
 of the atanta and or unless 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:05.320
 be masochists and you want to hurt yourself 

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:06.820
 unfortunately it is not his fault that this 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:09.610
 game is based mainly on the 

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:12.790
 speed but it is a counter too negative 

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:14.680
 so far as I am concerned, the 

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:17.050
 player is one of the few who budge in 

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:18.789
 full this year those I have ready 

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:21.789
 who all day more or less all well 

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:24.729
 is one of the few that really buds 

00:05:21.789 --> 00:05:26.350
 full delayed we do so but 

00:05:24.729 --> 00:05:28.270
 delayed I don't know when because even though 

00:05:26.350 --> 00:05:30.940
 should he ever have a problem 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:36.340
 top version would not even exceed the 

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:38.200
 60 of 72 73 of speed therefore therefore 

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:40.479
 totally postponed here maybe if 

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:42.789
 you really want a striker like that 

00:05:40.479 --> 00:05:44.740
 take mario gomez also the version 

00:05:42.789 --> 00:05:46.810
 nick but more than anything the man of version 

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:48.250
 the match which is really strong 

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:49.810
 it costs just a bit more but it is 

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:51.970
 really strong 

00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:54.639
 however the final grade as you see is a 

00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:56.919
 5 I put a 5 right because his goals 

00:05:54.639 --> 00:05:59.590
 in the end the boy made them though 

00:05:56.919 --> 00:06:01.840
 as top goals I just pull power and 

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:03.760
 Physical Strength Flop Acceleration Speed 

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:06.550
 shot to lap dribbling two star script 

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:08.800
 balance these the balance skills 

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:12.520
 so player is negative 

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:14.620
 I recommend the players I put in 

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:17.110
 description you will also find the teams 

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:18.639
 that where I tried it is the video with i 

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:20.919
 his two goals 

00:06:18.639 --> 00:06:22.870
 who made him inform us see you 

00:06:20.919 --> 00:06:25.080
 in a next video nice to all from 

00:06:22.870 --> 00:06:25.080
 well
