question is is soft cut messy to remove

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:11.930 
question is is soft cut messy to remove
so<00:00:08.970> we<00:00:09.540> always<00:00:09.870> try<00:00:10.290> to<00:00:10.320> be<00:00:10.679> very<00:00:11.280> honest<00:00:11.730> and

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:11.940 
so we always try to be very honest and

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.720 
so we always try to be very honest and
upfront<00:00:12.059> soft<00:00:12.990> cut<00:00:13.230> can<00:00:13.799> be<00:00:13.830> messy<00:00:14.370> the<00:00:14.519> first

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
upfront soft cut can be messy the first

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.910 
upfront soft cut can be messy the first
few<00:00:15.030> times<00:00:15.179> that<00:00:15.360> you<00:00:15.599> remove<00:00:15.900> it<00:00:16.109> you'll

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:16.920 
few times that you remove it you'll

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.740 
few times that you remove it you'll
likely<00:00:17.190> get<00:00:17.550> a<00:00:17.580> little<00:00:17.910> bit<00:00:18.029> on<00:00:18.210> your<00:00:18.359> finger

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
likely get a little bit on your finger

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.620 
likely get a little bit on your finger
however<00:00:19.680> with<00:00:19.920> practice<00:00:20.430> removal<00:00:21.300> becomes

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
however with practice removal becomes

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.769 
however with practice removal becomes
much<00:00:21.930> easier<00:00:21.960> and<00:00:22.590> much<00:00:22.890> cleaner<00:00:23.250> I<00:00:23.630> think<00:00:24.630> the

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
much easier and much cleaner I think the

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:26.839 
much easier and much cleaner I think the
best<00:00:24.990> way<00:00:25.260> to<00:00:25.289> remove<00:00:25.800> softcup<00:00:26.310> is<00:00:26.460> to<00:00:26.609> sit<00:00:26.820> on

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:42.239 
level as possible another great tip for

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.209 
level as possible another great tip for
removal<00:00:42.870> if<00:00:43.020> you're<00:00:43.200> worried<00:00:43.680> about<00:00:43.770> the<00:00:44.010> max

removal if you're worried about the max

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.810 
removal if you're worried about the max

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:47.820 
is to try it in the shower so again with

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.400 
is to try it in the shower so again with
practice<00:00:48.270> becomes<00:00:48.930> much<00:00:49.140> easier<00:00:49.170> and<00:00:49.620> clearer

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:51.410

option for you unfortunately itself kept
reusable<00:01:57.649> we<00:01:58.609> have<00:01:58.969> two<00:01:59.390> versions<00:01:59.899> actually

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:00.469 
reusable we have two versions actually

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:03.069 
reusable we have two versions actually
so<00:02:00.740> we<00:02:00.890> have<00:02:01.130> a<00:02:01.250> disposable<00:02:01.909> one-time<00:02:02.509> version

00:02:03.069 --> 00:02:03.079 
so we have a disposable one-time version

00:02:03.079 --> 00:02:06.550 
so we have a disposable one-time version
that<00:02:03.890> you<00:02:04.159> use<00:02:04.610> once<00:02:04.880> and<00:02:05.149> toss<00:02:05.390> and<00:02:05.840> we<00:02:06.380> also

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:06.560 
that you use once and toss and we also

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.800 
that you use once and toss and we also
have<00:02:06.950> a<00:02:06.979> reusable<00:02:07.850> that<00:02:08.090> can<00:02:08.269> be<00:02:08.360> rinsed<00:02:08.539> and

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:08.810 
have a reusable that can be rinsed and

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:11.289 
have a reusable that can be rinsed and
reused<00:02:09.170> for<00:02:09.500> one<00:02:09.679> cycle<00:02:10.220> and<00:02:10.429> then<00:02:11.000> you<00:02:11.120> don't

00:02:11.289 --> 00:02:11.299 
reused for one cycle and then you don't

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:12.880 
reused for one cycle and then you don't
have<00:02:11.360> to<00:02:11.510> worry<00:02:11.660> about<00:02:11.720> sanitizing<00:02:12.620> it<00:02:12.739> and

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:12.890 
have to worry about sanitizing it and

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.460 
have to worry about sanitizing it and
storing<00:02:13.250> in<00:02:13.430> between<00:02:13.870> great<00:02:14.870> thanks<00:02:15.260> Caitlin

00:02:15.460 --> 00:02:15.470 
storing in between great thanks Caitlin

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.950 
storing in between great thanks Caitlin
