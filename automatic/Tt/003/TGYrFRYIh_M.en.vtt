00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.050 

okay<00:00:00.780> so<00:00:00.840> I<00:00:01.050> have<00:00:01.410> established<00:00:01.770> a<00:00:02.280> basic

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:03.060 
okay so I have established a basic

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:04.460 
okay so I have established a basic
framework<00:00:03.449> on<00:00:03.959> here

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:04.470 
framework on here

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:07.369 
framework on here
just<00:00:04.890> as<00:00:05.040> a<00:00:05.069> point<00:00:05.910> of<00:00:06.120> starting<00:00:06.750> and<00:00:06.930> I<00:00:07.319> know

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
just as a point of starting and I know

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:11.749 
just as a point of starting and I know
that<00:00:07.950> this<00:00:08.309> is<00:00:08.790> going<00:00:09.150> to<00:00:09.330> be<00:00:10.490> the<00:00:11.490> line<00:00:11.730> that

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:11.759 
that this is going to be the line that

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:14.950 
that this is going to be the line that
represents<00:00:12.300> the<00:00:13.259> back<00:00:13.559> edge<00:00:13.830> of<00:00:13.980> that<00:00:14.040> table

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:14.960 
represents the back edge of that table

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:17.450 
represents the back edge of that table
everything<00:00:15.960> will<00:00:16.170> be<00:00:16.289> measured<00:00:16.740> in<00:00:16.859> terms<00:00:17.160> of

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:17.460 
everything will be measured in terms of

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:20.450 
everything will be measured in terms of
that<00:00:18.109> location<00:00:19.109> and<00:00:19.470> if<00:00:19.680> I<00:00:19.830> look<00:00:20.130> at<00:00:20.279> my

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:20.460 
that location and if I look at my

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.970 
that location and if I look at my
drawing<00:00:20.820> and<00:00:21.180> measure<00:00:21.689> things<00:00:21.990> out<00:00:22.320> I<00:00:22.560> can

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
drawing and measure things out I can

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:28.599 
drawing and measure things out I can
pretty<00:00:23.310> well<00:00:23.430> tell<00:00:23.939> that<00:00:25.099> that<00:00:26.099> pot<00:00:26.900> will<00:00:27.900> land

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:28.609 
pretty well tell that that pot will land

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:32.840 
pretty well tell that that pot will land
at<00:00:29.609> about<00:00:29.640> this<00:00:30.390> location<00:00:31.080> for<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:31.380> top<00:00:31.850> curve

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:32.850 
at about this location for the top curve

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:35.630 
at about this location for the top curve
of<00:00:33.149> that<00:00:33.320> little<00:00:34.320> pot<00:00:34.559> so<00:00:35.130> I'm<00:00:35.219> just<00:00:35.399> gonna

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
of that little pot so I'm just gonna

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.340 
of that little pot so I'm just gonna
rough<00:00:36.180> sketch<00:00:36.899> it<00:00:37.110> out<00:00:37.940> it<00:00:38.940> goes<00:00:39.420> below<00:00:39.960> the

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:40.350 
rough sketch it out it goes below the

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:52.880 
rough sketch it out it goes below the
table<00:00:45.289> and<00:00:50.239> now<00:00:51.239> I<00:00:51.270> have<00:00:51.600> the<00:00:51.809> first<00:00:52.050> part<00:00:52.230> of

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:52.890 
table and now I have the first part of

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:57.139 
table and now I have the first part of
my<00:00:54.050> composition<00:00:55.050> sketched<00:00:55.770> out<00:00:56.010> and<00:00:56.309> that's

00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:57.149 
my composition sketched out and that's

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:03.529 
my composition sketched out and that's
not<00:00:57.480> a<00:00:57.539> bad<00:00:57.840> place<00:00:58.199> to<00:00:59.300> begin<00:01:01.910> let's<00:01:02.910> see<00:01:03.210> if<00:01:03.390> I

00:01:03.529 --> 00:01:03.539 
not a bad place to begin let's see if I

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:05.870 
not a bad place to begin let's see if I
can<00:01:03.750> find<00:01:04.080> the<00:01:04.409> other<00:01:04.650> things<00:01:05.040> that<00:01:05.519> are<00:01:05.670> going

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:05.880 
can find the other things that are going

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:08.359 
can find the other things that are going
on<00:01:06.210> relative<00:01:06.720> to<00:01:07.260> the<00:01:07.380> position<00:01:07.530> of<00:01:07.890> this<00:01:08.100> one

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:08.369 
on relative to the position of this one

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:15.760 
on relative to the position of this one
I<00:01:08.720> can<00:01:09.720> see<00:01:09.960> that<00:01:10.200> this<00:01:11.119> the<00:01:12.119> back<00:01:12.500> vase<00:01:14.299> is

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:15.770 
I can see that this the back vase is

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.789 
I can see that this the back vase is
about<00:01:16.770> in<00:01:17.009> here<00:01:17.460> and<00:01:17.670> it's<00:01:18.030> coming<00:01:18.600> in<00:01:18.900> right

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:19.799 
about in here and it's coming in right

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:22.010 
about in here and it's coming in right
along<00:01:19.979> the<00:01:20.430> edge<00:01:20.580> of<00:01:20.790> that<00:01:20.850> golden<00:01:21.450> rectangle

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020 
along the edge of that golden rectangle

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:24.800 
along the edge of that golden rectangle
section<00:01:22.259> and<00:01:22.680> it<00:01:22.860> ends<00:01:23.280> a<00:01:23.400> little<00:01:23.909> bit<00:01:24.240> shorter

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
section and it ends a little bit shorter

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:30.850 
section and it ends a little bit shorter
and<00:01:26.479> then<00:01:27.479> we've<00:01:27.869> got<00:01:28.080> another<00:01:28.340> larger<00:01:29.340> pot

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:30.860 
and then we've got another larger pot

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:35.300 
and then we've got another larger pot
that<00:01:32.630> relative<00:01:33.630> to<00:01:33.659> there<00:01:34.170> I<00:01:34.439> can<00:01:34.710> see<00:01:35.009> that

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310 
that relative to there I can see that

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:41.450 
that relative to there I can see that
the<00:01:35.970> pot<00:01:36.299> sticks<00:01:36.869> up<00:01:37.079> a<00:01:37.229> little<00:01:37.590> bit<00:01:38.570> and<00:01:40.460> is

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
the pot sticks up a little bit and is

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.359 
the pot sticks up a little bit and is
rounded<00:01:42.090> and<00:01:42.329> just<00:01:42.810> touches<00:01:43.470> from<00:01:44.130> where<00:01:44.340> I

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
rounded and just touches from where I

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.749 
rounded and just touches from where I
can<00:01:44.729> see<00:01:44.970> it<00:01:45.000> here<00:01:45.509> and<00:01:45.630> is<00:01:46.320> pretty<00:01:47.009> much<00:01:47.220> even

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759 
can see it here and is pretty much even

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:51.830 
can see it here and is pretty much even
with<00:01:47.909> the<00:01:48.030> bottom<00:01:48.420> here<00:01:48.899> so<00:01:50.270> I'm<00:01:51.270> just<00:01:51.299> using

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
with the bottom here so I'm just using

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.950 
with the bottom here so I'm just using
this<00:01:52.680> as<00:01:52.890> a<00:01:53.340> framework<00:01:53.700> in<00:01:54.360> order<00:01:54.780> to

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960 
this as a framework in order to

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.260 
this as a framework in order to
establish<00:01:55.140> the<00:01:55.829> basic<00:01:56.189> shapes<00:01:56.430> and<00:01:56.640> I'm<00:01:57.030> going

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
establish the basic shapes and I'm going

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.149 
establish the basic shapes and I'm going
to<00:01:57.329> go<00:01:57.450> ahead<00:01:57.570> and<00:01:57.810> let<00:01:57.990> this<00:01:58.200> pot<00:01:58.500> fall

00:01:59.149 --> 00:01:59.159 
to go ahead and let this pot fall

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:03.590 
to go ahead and let this pot fall
outside<00:02:00.119> of<00:02:00.630> our<00:02:01.200> frame<00:02:01.969> because<00:02:02.969> what<00:02:03.270> I<00:02:03.299> want

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:03.600 
outside of our frame because what I want

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:05.240 
outside of our frame because what I want
to<00:02:03.689> do<00:02:03.840> is<00:02:03.990> I<00:02:04.079> want<00:02:04.290> to<00:02:04.320> make<00:02:04.500> sure<00:02:04.530> that<00:02:04.860> kitty

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
to do is I want to make sure that kitty

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.330 
to do is I want to make sure that kitty
is<00:02:05.520> about<00:02:06.329> in<00:02:06.540> the<00:02:06.570> right<00:02:06.840> place<00:02:07.229> and<00:02:07.530> right

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
is about in the right place and right

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.180 
is about in the right place and right
now

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
now

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:15.030 
now
that<00:02:09.369> kitties<00:02:10.030> back<00:02:11.580> is<00:02:12.580> sitting<00:02:13.830> right<00:02:14.830> in

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
that kitties back is sitting right in

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:23.550 
that kitties back is sitting right in
here<00:02:16.200> so<00:02:17.200> our<00:02:17.530> kitty<00:02:19.860> is<00:02:21.390> landing<00:02:22.390> with<00:02:23.380> its

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:23.560 
here so our kitty is landing with its

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:25.440 
here so our kitty is landing with its
heart<00:02:23.890> right<00:02:24.490> about<00:02:24.700> in<00:02:24.910> that<00:02:25.060> golden

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450 
heart right about in that golden

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:29.100 
heart right about in that golden
rectangle<00:02:26.100> intersection
