the two most anabolic substances in the

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:19.390 
the two most anabolic substances in the
planet<00:00:17.810> the<00:00:18.470> reason<00:00:18.770> for<00:00:18.920> this<00:00:19.009> video<00:00:19.189> is

it<00:01:02.420> or<00:01:02.480> not<00:01:02.629> food<00:01:02.929> and<00:01:03.109> water<00:01:03.319> are<00:01:03.679> even<00:01:04.070> more

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:04.550 
it or not food and water are even more

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:06.910 
it or not food and water are even more
anabolic<00:01:05.150> that's<00:01:05.900> their<00:01:06.170> each<00:01:06.320> themselves

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:06.920 
anabolic that's their each themselves

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:09.430 
anabolic that's their each themselves
okay<00:01:07.430> because<00:01:08.090> they're<00:01:08.690> its<00:01:08.870> cannot<00:01:09.200> even

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:09.440 
okay because they're its cannot even

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.080 
okay because they're its cannot even
work<00:01:09.680> if<00:01:09.920> you're<00:01:10.220> not<00:01:10.400> taking<00:01:10.729> the<00:01:10.820> food<00:01:10.970> of

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:11.090 
work if you're not taking the food of

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:13.540 
work if you're not taking the food of
the<00:01:11.180> world<00:01:11.650> what<00:01:12.650> is<00:01:12.740> the<00:01:12.830> reason<00:01:13.160> for<00:01:13.190> this

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:13.550 
the world what is the reason for this

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:16.540 
the world what is the reason for this
well<00:01:13.970> think<00:01:14.930> about<00:01:15.020> this<00:01:15.290> if<00:01:16.070> you're<00:01:16.340> building

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:16.550 
well think about this if you're building

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:18.970 
well think about this if you're building
the<00:01:16.850> Empire<00:01:17.120> State<00:01:17.450> Building<00:01:17.480> right<00:01:18.050> you

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:18.980 
the Empire State Building right you

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:20.560 
the Empire State Building right you
figure<00:01:19.490> you<00:01:19.640> need<00:01:19.790> a<00:01:20.090> whole<00:01:20.330> bunch<00:01:20.480> of

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:20.570 
figure you need a whole bunch of

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.280 
figure you need a whole bunch of
contractors<00:01:21.200> and<00:01:21.380> a<00:01:21.950> whole<00:01:22.100> bunch<00:01:22.130> of<00:01:23.290> raw

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:24.290 
contractors and a whole bunch of raw

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.350 
contractors and a whole bunch of raw
materials<00:01:24.860> like<00:01:25.100> cement<00:01:25.310> and<00:01:25.880> other<00:01:26.000> things

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:26.360 
materials like cement and other things

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.960 
materials like cement and other things
that<00:01:26.510> you<00:01:26.630> need<00:01:26.840> to<00:01:27.020> go<00:01:27.140> ahead<00:01:27.290> and<00:01:27.620> and<00:01:28.100> put

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:28.970 
that you need to go ahead and and put

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:30.700 
that you need to go ahead and and put
together<00:01:29.150> so<00:01:29.660> you<00:01:29.720> can<00:01:29.930> make<00:01:30.140> such<00:01:30.380> a<00:01:30.410> big

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:30.710 
together so you can make such a big

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.670 
together so you can make such a big
building<00:01:30.950> right<00:01:31.990> but<00:01:32.990> what<00:01:33.110> if<00:01:33.200> you<00:01:33.320> just<00:01:33.500> have

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:33.680 
building right but what if you just have

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.140 
building right but what if you just have
the<00:01:33.770> contractors<00:01:34.340> and<00:01:34.550> you<00:01:34.610> don't<00:01:34.760> have<00:01:34.910> the

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:35.150 
the contractors and you don't have the

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:36.720 
the contractors and you don't have the
the<00:01:35.780> raw<00:01:35.900> material

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:36.730 
the raw material

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:39.760 
the raw material
you<00:01:37.730> can't<00:01:37.940> build<00:01:38.150> anything<00:01:38.840> same<00:01:39.230> thing<00:01:39.470> here

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:39.770 
you can't build anything same thing here

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.460 
you can't build anything same thing here
when<00:01:40.250> you<00:01:40.370> go<00:01:40.460> ahead<00:01:40.580> and<00:01:40.850> you<00:01:40.940> train<00:01:41.180> you<00:01:41.990> you

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:42.470 
when you go ahead and you train you you

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:44.680 
when you go ahead and you train you you
give<00:01:42.680> your<00:01:42.860> body<00:01:43.010> the<00:01:43.310> stimulus<00:01:43.880> to<00:01:44.330> go<00:01:44.420> ahead

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:44.690 
give your body the stimulus to go ahead

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:47.920 
give your body the stimulus to go ahead
and<00:01:45.020> and<00:01:45.260> start<00:01:46.010> growing<00:01:46.550> some<00:01:46.610> muscles<00:01:47.090> but

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:47.930 
and and start growing some muscles but

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.860 
and and start growing some muscles but
if<00:01:48.080> you<00:01:48.230> don't<00:01:48.440> go<00:01:48.800> ahead<00:01:49.700> and<00:01:49.850> feed<00:01:50.210> yourself

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:50.870 
if you don't go ahead and feed yourself

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:53.830 
if you don't go ahead and feed yourself
with<00:01:51.140> the<00:01:52.000> carbohydrates<00:01:53.000> the<00:01:53.240> protein<00:01:53.690> and

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:53.840 
with the carbohydrates the protein and

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.320 
with the carbohydrates the protein and
the<00:01:54.020> fats<00:01:54.290> that<00:01:54.500> your<00:01:54.740> body<00:01:55.010> needs<00:01:55.340> to<00:01:55.730> go

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:56.330 
the fats that your body needs to go

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:59.650 
the fats that your body needs to go
ahead<00:01:56.450> and<00:01:57.020> take<00:01:57.650> those<00:01:57.980> nutrients<00:01:58.760> and<00:01:58.880> grow

00:01:59.650 --> 00:01:59.660 
ahead and take those nutrients and grow

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:02.170 
ahead and take those nutrients and grow
new<00:01:59.900> muscle<00:02:00.400> you<00:02:01.400> never<00:02:01.580> gonna<00:02:01.700> grow<00:02:01.880> anything

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180 
new muscle you never gonna grow anything
