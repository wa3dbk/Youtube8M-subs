00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:16.470
 Hello dear friends with you Alex 

00:00:13.379 --> 00:00:19.349
 and today I'm starting to review fashion and my 

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:21.260
 the first mod adds maykravt about sitting 

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:24.750
 new weapons and armor 

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:27.350
 let's start with the weapon first is the sword 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:35.270
 he is on 10 damage 

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:38.900
 let's check on the mount so time 2 s 

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:40.300
 two blows we can kill him here by 11 

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:45.820
 about 

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:47.510
 the fuck did quite well in principle 

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:51.610
 let's move on 

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:54.739
 a pickaxe already so pickaxe deals 6 damage 

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:56.170
 let's check it out just on 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:01:00.530
 stone 

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:04.269
 stone etc. here he is digging she is very 

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:07.280
 very fast bliss 

00:01:04.269 --> 00:01:08.950
 how to dig 

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.860
 ok 

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:15.130
 everyone in the pickaxe finished now go 

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:19.060
 farther farther we go shovel she 5 

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:24.189
 Damaga but dig see how fast already 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:27.100
 they dug their hooves a canyon very well 

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:30.630
 and quickly dig so ok now we have 

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:33.579
 ax goes ax for 7 damage 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.819
 she is 7 so we have here 

00:01:33.579 --> 00:01:38.649
 let's just check the tree 

00:01:35.819 --> 00:01:43.659
 dig like increasing very very very 

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:46.030
 fast it's good and now we are waiting 

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:53.610
 the most incomprehensible this hoe 

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:55.680
 yes she has no damage at all she just 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:59.760
 plows 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:02:03.080
 I don't understand why you need it anyway 

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:06.180
 still does not change but it does not matter 

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:08.149
 Well, in principle, with weapons all now 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:11.370
 let's go to 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:15.920
 let's not first see craft and 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:19.830
 this weapon is done like this 

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:22.650
 It is made of two diamonds 4 ingots and 

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:23.459
 here is such a wand that's such here 

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:28.010
 ingots 

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:30.810
 being made quit fold crafter 

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:37.760
 obsidian then we get 9 such scrolls 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:41.670
 either with sharpen I give with 8 steps and 1 

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:45.320
 I re-bucket the lava dofiga 

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:47.970
 and min so we get 8 of these ingots a 

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:50.580
 they already just melt down if 

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:54.890
 melt down obsidian in principle not very 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:59.150
 so hard and this stick is made of 

00:02:54.890 --> 00:03:01.459
 single scroll and simple wand 

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:07.150
 okay now let's see how to craft 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:09.879
 we have a kirk kraft it with us like this 

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:14.950
 watch and remember 

00:03:09.879 --> 00:03:14.950
 further shovel 1 but in this way 

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:22.730
 now an ax but itâ€™s just different 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:24.650
 sides of the same thing and here with a hoe here 

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:28.430
 somehow incomprehensible, see here 2 diamonds 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:30.260
 then two then three ingot plum but it also 

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:34.610
 but I donâ€™t understand 

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:35.989
 it is an issue of loyalty but the food in the press with 

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:39.050
 weapons all 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:40.599
 crafting is certainly expensive but how are you 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:44.450
 see big damage and 

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:45.190
 but it's worth it so let's go to 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:48.470
 armor 

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:51.549
 Here is the armor Here is such a principle 

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:54.709
 pretty so black 

00:03:51.549 --> 00:03:59.330
 it also fills like a diamond 

00:03:54.709 --> 00:04:02.090
 look i don't think that diamond is so 

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:06.590
 can cover us and several creeper 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:09.519
 damage is not done only if we fly away 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:09.519
 I'll show you now 

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:14.920
 Well, in short, when we are from summer and we fall 

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:16.970
 then we already damage 

00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:22.630
 Sven wear in response 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:24.110
 so come on clipper also want this one 

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:28.600
 see see 

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:28.600
 but nothing like that 

00:04:28.889 --> 00:04:34.650
 as well, and now let's move to craft 

00:04:31.909 --> 00:04:38.219
 crafting this armor like this 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:40.999
 just like usual bullion 

00:04:38.219 --> 00:04:44.400
 only doing here still need to put 

00:04:40.999 --> 00:04:49.069
 diamond u diamond hat here need 

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:55.439
 put here you need to do this 

00:04:49.069 --> 00:04:58.949
 on the legs like this and shoes like this but 

00:04:55.439 --> 00:05:00.749
 In principle, everything is clear and easy armor 

00:04:58.949 --> 00:05:04.560
 Of course it protects very well, but again 

00:05:00.749 --> 00:05:06.479
 Kraft very expensive so this 

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:10.050
 that's not in the ring is not cheating 

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:13.979
 and St. Petersburg and in principle, that's all 

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:16.110
 this mod has exhausted itself so everyone 

00:05:13.979 --> 00:05:18.300
