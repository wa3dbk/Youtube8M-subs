free-flow hand garden hose everything

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:54.469 
free-flow hand garden hose everything
you<00:01:51.960> need<00:01:52.140> to<00:01:52.350> need<00:01:52.740> to<00:01:53.159> install<00:01:53.430> it<00:01:53.640> this<00:01:54.060> is<00:01:54.270> a

00:01:54.469 --> 00:01:54.479 
you need to need to install it this is a

00:01:54.479 --> 00:01:56.780 
you need to need to install it this is a
oh<00:01:54.780> I<00:01:55.229> didn't<00:01:55.500> know<00:01:55.560> what<00:01:55.740> link<00:01:56.399> on<00:01:56.579> one<00:01:56.759> of

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:56.790 
oh I didn't know what link on one of

00:01:56.790 --> 00:01:58.789 
oh I didn't know what link on one of
like<00:01:57.000> 12<00:01:57.299> inch<00:01:57.540> or<00:01:57.899> 15<00:01:58.200> inch

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
like 12 inch or 15 inch

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.679 
like 12 inch or 15 inch
I<00:01:58.979> thought<00:01:59.490> 15<00:01:59.939> inch<00:02:00.119> might<00:02:00.329> be<00:02:00.479> a<00:02:00.509> little

00:02:00.679 --> 00:02:00.689 
I thought 15 inch might be a little

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.270 
I thought 15 inch might be a little
lunch<00:02:00.960> and<00:02:01.229> I'm<00:02:01.380> gonna<00:02:01.469> have<00:02:01.649> a<00:02:01.710> suppressor<00:02:02.189> on

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:02.280 
lunch and I'm gonna have a suppressor on

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.190 
lunch and I'm gonna have a suppressor on
it<00:02:03.320> so<00:02:04.320> this<00:02:04.560> is<00:02:04.740> a<00:02:04.770> twill

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:05.200 
it so this is a twill

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.740 
it so this is a twill
a<00:02:05.229> half<00:02:05.530> an<00:02:05.649> inch<00:02:05.740> and<00:02:06.070> it<00:02:06.490> looks<00:02:06.880> a<00:02:07.270> little<00:02:07.509> bit

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:07.750 
a half an inch and it looks a little bit

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.710 
a half an inch and it looks a little bit
bigger<00:02:07.899> actually<00:02:08.649> in<00:02:09.009> person<00:02:09.459> this<00:02:10.179> thing<00:02:10.450> is

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:10.720 
bigger actually in person this thing is

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.140 
bigger actually in person this thing is
heavy<00:02:11.050> to<00:02:11.440> wear<00:02:11.560> you<00:02:11.709> know<00:02:11.739> that<00:02:12.730> it's<00:02:12.970> made

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:13.150 
heavy to wear you know that it's made

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:14.309 
heavy to wear you know that it's made
out<00:02:13.330> of<00:02:13.360> like<00:02:13.599> a<00:02:13.629> good<00:02:13.810> material<00:02:14.290> and

00:02:14.309 --> 00:02:14.319 
out of like a good material and

00:02:14.319 --> 00:02:15.780 
out of like a good material and
everything<00:02:14.470> like<00:02:14.680> that<00:02:14.739> but<00:02:15.280> not<00:02:15.430> so<00:02:15.640> heavy

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
everything like that but not so heavy

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.160 
everything like that but not so heavy
that<00:02:15.940> it's<00:02:16.150> going<00:02:16.269> to<00:02:16.330> make<00:02:16.510> it<00:02:16.660> to<00:02:16.810> front

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:17.170 
that it's going to make it to front

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.199 
that it's going to make it to front
heavy<00:02:17.349> so<00:02:18.190> I<00:02:18.220> think<00:02:18.489> it's<00:02:18.790> a<00:02:18.849> very<00:02:19.030> nice

00:02:19.199 --> 00:02:19.209 
heavy so I think it's a very nice

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:22.380 
heavy so I think it's a very nice
balance<00:02:19.480> it<00:02:19.900> has<00:02:19.959> all<00:02:20.290> the<00:02:20.530> are<00:02:20.830> 24<00:02:21.370> or<00:02:21.640> 26<00:02:22.090> all

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:22.390 
balance it has all the are 24 or 26 all

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:27.420 
balance it has all the are 24 or 26 all
the<00:02:22.510> numbers<00:02:23.040> t-38<00:02:24.480> l38<00:02:25.480> be<00:02:26.110> 38<00:02:26.500> all<00:02:26.769> that<00:02:26.950> all

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:27.430 
the numbers t-38 l38 be 38 all that all

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:29.400 
the numbers t-38 l38 be 38 all that all
those<00:02:27.700> are<00:02:27.910> quite<00:02:28.360> little<00:02:28.720> numbers<00:02:29.019> on<00:02:29.200> here

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:29.410 
those are quite little numbers on here

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:32.729 
those are quite little numbers on here
so<00:02:29.709> it's<00:02:30.400> very<00:02:30.430> nice<00:02:30.760> to<00:02:30.819> come<00:02:31.090> with<00:02:31.299> the<00:02:31.739> donut

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:32.739 
so it's very nice to come with the donut

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:34.559 
so it's very nice to come with the donut
and<00:02:32.920> everything<00:02:33.280> like<00:02:33.400> that<00:02:33.430> to<00:02:33.640> install<00:02:34.180> it<00:02:34.360> I

00:02:34.559 --> 00:02:34.569 
and everything like that to install it I

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:36.869 
and everything like that to install it I
just<00:02:34.870> need<00:02:35.140> to<00:02:35.230> get<00:02:35.410> a<00:02:35.470> o<00:02:35.650> AR<00:02:36.069> wrench<00:02:36.489> but<00:02:36.849> I

00:02:36.869 --> 00:02:36.879 
just need to get a o AR wrench but I

00:02:36.879 --> 00:02:38.580 
just need to get a o AR wrench but I
think<00:02:37.090> that<00:02:37.180> we<00:02:37.299> tech<00:02:37.540> includes<00:02:37.959> one<00:02:38.260> I<00:02:38.440> might

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:38.590 
think that we tech includes one I might

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:40.250 
think that we tech includes one I might
just<00:02:38.799> get<00:02:38.920> another<00:02:39.130> one<00:02:39.250> anyway

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:40.260 
just get another one anyway

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:44.039 
just get another one anyway
anyways<00:02:41.610> like<00:02:42.610> I<00:02:42.700> said<00:02:42.940> this<00:02:43.090> is<00:02:43.269> a<00:02:43.299> twelve<00:02:43.870> and

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:44.049 
anyways like I said this is a twelve and

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:46.140 
anyways like I said this is a twelve and
a<00:02:44.079> half<00:02:44.110> inches<00:02:44.319> it<00:02:44.920> looks<00:02:45.190> very<00:02:45.489> nice<00:02:45.819> I've

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150 
a half inches it looks very nice I've

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.120 
a half inches it looks very nice I've
got<00:02:46.299> a<00:02:46.329> close<00:02:46.569> shot<00:02:46.900> of<00:02:46.959> that<00:02:47.620> in<00:02:47.920> just<00:02:47.950> a

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.130 
got a close shot of that in just a

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:52.500 
got a close shot of that in just a
second<00:02:48.489> so<00:02:49.090> I<00:02:49.420> bought<00:02:49.720> this<00:02:49.989> for<00:02:51.090> $89<00:02:52.090> so<00:02:52.239> 90

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510 
second so I bought this for $89 so 90

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:54.870 
second so I bought this for $89 so 90
bucks<00:02:52.690> from<00:02:52.900> academy<00:02:53.410> puppy<00:02:54.370> since<00:02:54.670> I<00:02:54.760> bought

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:54.880 
bucks from academy puppy since I bought

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:58.830 
bucks from academy puppy since I bought
it<00:02:55.030> in<00:02:55.180> state<00:02:55.569> I<00:02:55.840> probably<00:02:56.709> pick<00:02:57.010> a<00:02:57.040> 95<00:02:57.840> $200

00:02:58.830 --> 00:02:58.840 
it in state I probably pick a 95 $200

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.949 
it in state I probably pick a 95 $200
with<00:02:59.049> tax<00:02:59.290> so<00:03:00.099> I<00:03:00.430> think<00:03:00.579> this<00:03:01.180> rail<00:03:01.510> was<00:03:01.720> really

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:01.959 
with tax so I think this rail was really

00:03:01.959 --> 00:03:04.110 
with tax so I think this rail was really
good<00:03:02.200> I<00:03:02.500> was<00:03:03.340> about<00:03:03.519> to<00:03:03.640> get<00:03:03.760> like<00:03:03.910> a<00:03:03.940> really

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
good I was about to get like a really

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.270 
good I was about to get like a really
futuristic<00:03:04.420> kind<00:03:05.230> of<00:03:05.349> rail<00:03:05.590> and<00:03:05.980> stuff<00:03:06.160> like

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:06.280 
futuristic kind of rail and stuff like

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.949 
futuristic kind of rail and stuff like
that<00:03:06.459> like<00:03:06.610> a<00:03:06.700> 15<00:03:07.090> inch<00:03:07.329> or<00:03:07.599> something<00:03:07.720> like

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
that like a 15 inch or something like

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:09.840 
that like a 15 inch or something like
that<00:03:08.140> from<00:03:08.260> you<00:03:08.349> know<00:03:08.380> best<00:03:08.680> ski<00:03:08.890> but<00:03:09.670> then<00:03:09.819> I

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:09.850 
that from you know best ski but then I

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:11.220 
that from you know best ski but then I
realized<00:03:10.239> that<00:03:10.299> I<00:03:10.450> wanted<00:03:10.750> more<00:03:11.079> of<00:03:11.109> a

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
realized that I wanted more of a

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.020 
realized that I wanted more of a
realistic<00:03:11.620> one<00:03:12.010> like<00:03:12.250> what's<00:03:12.579> probably<00:03:12.910> gonna

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030 
realistic one like what's probably gonna

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:16.199 
realistic one like what's probably gonna
be<00:03:13.150> used<00:03:13.389> overseas<00:03:14.230> and<00:03:14.920> stuff<00:03:15.250> so<00:03:15.910> I<00:03:15.940> think

00:03:16.199 --> 00:03:16.209 
be used overseas and stuff so I think

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:18.210 
be used overseas and stuff so I think
with<00:03:16.329> this<00:03:16.540> and<00:03:16.989> a<00:03:17.109> fixed<00:03:17.500> stock<00:03:17.650> kind<00:03:18.069> of<00:03:18.130> make

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:18.220 
with this and a fixed stock kind of make

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:20.940 
with this and a fixed stock kind of make
it<00:03:18.370> look<00:03:18.519> like<00:03:18.609> a<00:03:18.670> kwa<00:03:19.269> SR<00:03:19.540> 12<00:03:19.840> probably<00:03:20.799> gonna

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:20.950 
it look like a kwa SR 12 probably gonna

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:24.059 
it look like a kwa SR 12 probably gonna
put<00:03:21.190> a<00:03:21.250> scope<00:03:21.549> bipod<00:03:22.090> suppressor<00:03:22.870> all<00:03:23.769> that

00:03:24.059 --> 00:03:24.069 
put a scope bipod suppressor all that

00:03:24.069 --> 00:03:25.410 
put a scope bipod suppressor all that
kind<00:03:24.250> of<00:03:24.280> stuff<00:03:24.400> and<00:03:24.760> some<00:03:24.940> other<00:03:25.120> stuff<00:03:25.389> that

uh you're gonna see me you thought you
guys<00:03:27.670> have<00:03:27.850> seen<00:03:27.970> the<00:03:28.090> unboxing<00:03:28.660> um<00:03:29.639> so<00:03:30.639> I

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:30.670 
guys have seen the unboxing um so I

00:03:30.670 --> 00:03:31.800 
guys have seen the unboxing um so I
think<00:03:30.790> with<00:03:31.150> all<00:03:31.269> that<00:03:31.420> kind<00:03:31.569> of<00:03:31.600> stuff<00:03:31.690> that

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
think with all that kind of stuff that

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.140 
think with all that kind of stuff that
would<00:03:32.019> look<00:03:32.200> like<00:03:32.260> more<00:03:32.799> realistically<00:03:33.340> you

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:34.150 
would look like more realistically you

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:35.940 
would look like more realistically you
probably<00:03:34.450> see<00:03:34.630> it<00:03:34.690> overseas<00:03:35.109> instead<00:03:35.739> of

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:35.950 
probably see it overseas instead of

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:37.800 
probably see it overseas instead of
something<00:03:36.100> futuristic<00:03:36.850> with<00:03:37.090> the<00:03:37.269> no

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:37.810 
something futuristic with the no

00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:39.030 
something futuristic with the no
vesicular<00:03:38.170> rail<00:03:38.440> and<00:03:38.680> everything<00:03:38.920> like<00:03:38.980> that

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:39.040 
vesicular rail and everything like that

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.670 
vesicular rail and everything like that
so<00:03:39.400> I'm<00:03:40.180> gonna<00:03:40.329> go<00:03:40.480> ahead<00:03:40.569> and<00:03:40.720> just<00:03:41.019> zoom<00:03:41.470> in

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:41.680 
so I'm gonna go ahead and just zoom in

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.569 
so I'm gonna go ahead and just zoom in
on<00:03:41.799> this<00:03:41.980> and<00:03:42.850> in<00:03:43.630> just<00:03:43.870> a<00:03:43.959> second<00:03:44.319> and<00:03:44.620> two

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:45.579 
on this and in just a second and two

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:47.490 
on this and in just a second and two
other<00:03:45.790> things<00:03:45.880> let<00:03:46.660> me<00:03:46.780> just<00:03:46.959> grab<00:03:47.049> it<00:03:47.260> real

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.500 
other things let me just grab it real

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:52.229 
other things let me just grab it real
quickly<00:03:48.720> so<00:03:49.720> I<00:03:50.079> was<00:03:50.290> ready<00:03:50.530> to<00:03:50.620> buy<00:03:50.859> a<00:03:51.239> new

00:03:52.229 --> 00:03:52.239 
quickly so I was ready to buy a new

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:57.150 
quickly so I was ready to buy a new
scope<00:03:52.690> and<00:03:53.290> bipod<00:03:54.150> but<00:03:55.150> I<00:03:55.480> figured<00:03:56.170> I'm<00:03:56.980> just

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:57.160 
scope and bipod but I figured I'm just

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:58.890 
scope and bipod but I figured I'm just
gonna<00:03:57.310> use<00:03:57.579> the<00:03:57.730> ones<00:03:57.880> I<00:03:58.030> already<00:03:58.060> have<00:03:58.389> as<00:03:58.720> you

00:03:58.890 --> 00:03:58.900 
gonna use the ones I already have as you

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:01.129 
gonna use the ones I already have as you
guys<00:03:59.200> may<00:03:59.709> have<00:03:59.739> seen<00:03:59.859> from<00:04:00.280> my<00:04:00.430> other<00:04:00.579> videos

00:04:01.129 --> 00:04:01.139 
guys may have seen from my other videos

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:05.479 
guys may have seen from my other videos
this<00:04:02.139> is<00:04:02.319> just<00:04:02.530> my<00:04:02.650> utg<00:04:03.250> hairstyle<00:04:04.030> bipod<00:04:04.450> and

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:05.489 
this is just my utg hairstyle bipod and

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:08.550 
this is just my utg hairstyle bipod and
as<00:04:06.489> you<00:04:06.639> can<00:04:06.760> see<00:04:06.910> it's<00:04:07.030> painted<00:04:07.540> like<00:04:08.380> my

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:08.560 
as you can see it's painted like my

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:09.839 
as you can see it's painted like my
sniper<00:04:08.889> which<00:04:09.280> I<00:04:09.370> don't<00:04:09.459> think<00:04:09.579> you<00:04:09.790> guys

00:04:09.839 --> 00:04:09.849 
sniper which I don't think you guys

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:12.420 
sniper which I don't think you guys
could<00:04:10.090> see<00:04:10.269> it's<00:04:10.750> paint<00:04:10.959> like<00:04:11.139> my<00:04:11.260> sniper<00:04:11.560> I

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:12.430 
could see it's paint like my sniper I

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:13.979 
could see it's paint like my sniper I
probably<00:04:13.030> should<00:04:13.299> not<00:04:13.420> have<00:04:13.569> painted<00:04:13.900> the

00:04:13.979 --> 00:04:13.989 
probably should not have painted the

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:15.720 
probably should not have painted the
scope<00:04:14.260> and<00:04:14.409> bipod<00:04:14.799> just<00:04:15.040> because<00:04:15.400> I'm

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:15.730 
scope and bipod just because I'm

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:17.270 
scope and bipod just because I'm
probably<00:04:16.359> gonna<00:04:16.599> be<00:04:16.720> switching

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:17.280 
probably gonna be switching

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:20.060 
probably gonna be switching
from<00:04:17.609> gun<00:04:18.090> to<00:04:18.269> gun<00:04:18.450> so<00:04:19.200> I<00:04:19.230> could<00:04:19.530> easily<00:04:19.650> remove

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
from gun to gun so I could easily remove

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:21.860 
from gun to gun so I could easily remove
the<00:04:20.250> paint<00:04:20.489> with<00:04:20.760> some<00:04:20.790> kind<00:04:21.420> of<00:04:21.510> alcohol

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
the paint with some kind of alcohol

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:25.190 
the paint with some kind of alcohol
thing<00:04:22.560> or<00:04:22.770> something<00:04:23.190> so<00:04:23.760> I<00:04:24.090> probably<00:04:24.660> put

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.200 
thing or something so I probably put

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:28.430 
thing or something so I probably put
these<00:04:25.350> back<00:04:25.560> to<00:04:26.160> being<00:04:26.910> black<00:04:27.240> put<00:04:28.050> those<00:04:28.200> on

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:28.440 
these back to being black put those on

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:32.990 
these back to being black put those on
the<00:04:28.560> gum<00:04:28.740> and<00:04:28.920> this<00:04:29.610> scope<00:04:29.880> has<00:04:30.150> a<00:04:31.190> flip<00:04:32.190> up<00:04:32.400> the

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:33.000 
the gum and this scope has a flip up the

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.810 
the gum and this scope has a flip up the
covers<00:04:33.390> front<00:04:33.840> and<00:04:33.960> back<00:04:34.430> they're<00:04:35.430> just<00:04:35.460> stuck

00:04:35.810 --> 00:04:35.820 
covers front and back they're just stuck

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:37.280 
covers front and back they're just stuck
in<00:04:36.000> there<00:04:36.120> so<00:04:36.270> I'll<00:04:36.360> get<00:04:36.480> the<00:04:36.600> front<00:04:36.780> one<00:04:37.050> and

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:37.290 
in there so I'll get the front one and

00:04:37.290 --> 00:04:39.950 
in there so I'll get the front one and
then<00:04:38.190> this<00:04:38.790> one<00:04:38.850> though<00:04:39.150> just<00:04:39.330> flip<00:04:39.510> up<00:04:39.660> and<00:04:39.870> I

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:39.960 
then this one though just flip up and I

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:42.260 
then this one though just flip up and I
think<00:04:40.170> they<00:04:40.230> look<00:04:40.410> really<00:04:40.440> cool<00:04:40.770> and<00:04:41.280> the

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:42.270 
think they look really cool and the

00:04:42.270 --> 00:04:44.030 
think they look really cool and the
length<00:04:42.480> of<00:04:42.630> this<00:04:42.750> scope<00:04:42.960> will<00:04:43.470> probably<00:04:43.890> look

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:44.040 
length of this scope will probably look

00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:47.060 
length of this scope will probably look
really<00:04:44.070> good<00:04:44.400> with<00:04:44.640> a<00:04:44.670> m16<00:04:45.600> length<00:04:46.290> gun<00:04:46.650> and

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:47.070 
really good with a m16 length gun and

00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:48.800 
really good with a m16 length gun and
this<00:04:47.940> by<00:04:48.120> plug<00:04:48.390> right<00:04:48.510> here

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:48.810 
this by plug right here

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:52.430 
this by plug right here
really<00:04:49.320> cool<00:04:50.780> sorry<00:04:51.780> the<00:04:51.900> phone's<00:04:52.140> ringing

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 
anyway so yeah once I get that back to

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:59.270 
anyway so yeah once I get that back to

00:04:59.270 --> 00:04:59.280 
black I think I look pretty cool and one

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:01.460 
black I think I look pretty cool and one
thing<00:04:59.400> I<00:04:59.460> didn't<00:04:59.760> mention<00:05:00.020> like<00:05:01.020> I<00:05:01.110> said<00:05:01.320> this

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:01.470 
thing I didn't mention like I said this

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:04.580 
thing I didn't mention like I said this
is<00:05:01.620> twelve<00:05:01.860> and<00:05:01.980> a<00:05:02.070> half<00:05:02.100> inch<00:05:02.720> rail<00:05:03.720> and<00:05:04.080> I'm

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:04.590 
is twelve and a half inch rail and I'm

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:06.230 
is twelve and a half inch rail and I'm
probably<00:05:04.710> gonna<00:05:04.919> have<00:05:05.130> some<00:05:05.160> rail<00:05:05.820> covers

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:06.240 
probably gonna have some rail covers

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:08.330 
probably gonna have some rail covers
which<00:05:06.419> I<00:05:06.540> already<00:05:06.630> have<00:05:06.780> from<00:05:07.230> my<00:05:07.350> kjw<00:05:07.919> gas

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:08.340 
which I already have from my kjw gas

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:11.930 
which I already have from my kjw gas
blowback<00:05:08.580> a<00:05:08.790> long<00:05:09.060> time<00:05:09.240> ago<00:05:10.550> these<00:05:11.550> are<00:05:11.610> some

00:05:11.930 --> 00:05:11.940 
blowback a long time ago these are some

00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:13.190 
blowback a long time ago these are some
rail<00:05:12.120> covers<00:05:12.450> that<00:05:12.600> included<00:05:13.020> it<00:05:13.080> I'll

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:13.200 
rail covers that included it I'll

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:15.470 
rail covers that included it I'll
probably<00:05:13.380> put<00:05:13.620> one<00:05:13.980> on<00:05:14.340> left<00:05:14.700> right<00:05:15.240> and

00:05:15.470 --> 00:05:15.480 
probably put one on left right and

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:18.860 
probably put one on left right and
bottom<00:05:15.720> and<00:05:16.140> so<00:05:17.100> with<00:05:17.310> that<00:05:17.600> I'll<00:05:18.600> kind<00:05:18.780> of

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:18.870 
bottom and so with that I'll kind of

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:20.480 
bottom and so with that I'll kind of
look<00:05:19.050> like<00:05:19.080> that<00:05:19.350> I<00:05:19.740> don't<00:05:19.800> really<00:05:19.980> know<00:05:20.310> how

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:20.490 
look like that I don't really know how

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:22.580 
look like that I don't really know how
well<00:05:20.669> you<00:05:20.760> could<00:05:20.910> see<00:05:21.060> it<00:05:21.150> but<00:05:21.840> I<00:05:22.110> think<00:05:22.169> I<00:05:22.380> look

00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:22.590 
well you could see it but I think I look

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:24.590 
well you could see it but I think I look
pretty<00:05:22.620> cool<00:05:23.010> like<00:05:23.190> that<00:05:23.460> so<00:05:24.240> I'm<00:05:24.390> just<00:05:24.510> gonna

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:24.600 
pretty cool like that so I'm just gonna

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:26.570 
pretty cool like that so I'm just gonna
go<00:05:24.780> ahead<00:05:24.990> and<00:05:25.169> show<00:05:25.290> you<00:05:25.350> a<00:05:25.530> close-up<00:05:25.800> on<00:05:26.220> how

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:26.580 
go ahead and show you a close-up on how

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:28.719 
go ahead and show you a close-up on how
this<00:05:26.760> looks

00:05:28.719 --> 00:05:28.729 
this looks

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:35.900 
this looks
let's<00:05:29.729> see<00:05:29.910> here<00:05:30.150> so<00:05:31.790> as<00:05:32.790> you<00:05:32.940> can<00:05:33.030> see<00:05:33.210> it<00:05:34.910> it

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:35.910 
let's see here so as you can see it it

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:38.120 
let's see here so as you can see it it
has<00:05:35.970> those<00:05:36.330> like<00:05:36.510> ovals<00:05:36.930> right<00:05:37.350> here<00:05:37.710> has

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:38.130 
has those like ovals right here has

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:41.659 
has those like ovals right here has
seven<00:05:38.550> of<00:05:38.700> those<00:05:38.940> ovals<00:05:39.330> and<00:05:40.190> this<00:05:41.190> is<00:05:41.430> the

00:05:41.659 --> 00:05:41.669 
seven of those ovals and this is the

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:44.420 
seven of those ovals and this is the
size<00:05:42.030> of<00:05:42.150> my<00:05:42.270> hand<00:05:42.510> right<00:05:43.140> here<00:05:43.190> compared<00:05:44.190> to

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:44.430 
size of my hand right here compared to

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:50.510 
size of my hand right here compared to
the<00:05:46.190> the<00:05:47.190> rail<00:05:47.640> so<00:05:48.060> it's<00:05:48.270> fairly<00:05:49.310> large<00:05:50.310> I

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:50.520 
the the rail so it's fairly large I

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:52.850 
the the rail so it's fairly large I
guess<00:05:50.729> the<00:05:51.300> the<00:05:52.140> rail<00:05:52.320> I<00:05:52.350> think<00:05:52.620> it<00:05:52.680> would<00:05:52.800> look

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:52.860 
guess the the rail I think it would look

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:55.340 
guess the the rail I think it would look
really<00:05:52.919> good<00:05:53.280> on<00:05:53.340> m16<00:05:54.050> variant<00:05:55.050> I'm<00:05:55.200> just

00:05:55.340 --> 00:05:55.350 
really good on m16 variant I'm just

00:05:55.350 --> 00:05:59.780 
really good on m16 variant I'm just
gonna<00:05:55.470> go<00:05:55.680> ahead<00:05:55.770> and<00:05:56.130> zoom<00:05:56.880> in<00:05:57.120> to<00:05:58.160> my<00:05:59.160> vfc

00:05:59.780 --> 00:05:59.790 
gonna go ahead and zoom in to my vfc

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:04.130 
gonna go ahead and zoom in to my vfc
which<00:06:00.030> is<00:06:00.210> standard<00:06:00.840> m4<00:06:01.729> let's<00:06:02.729> see<00:06:02.910> here<00:06:03.150> it's

00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:04.140 
which is standard m4 let's see here it's

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:09.500 
which is standard m4 let's see here it's
gonna<00:06:04.260> have<00:06:04.410> to<00:06:04.470> adjust<00:06:04.620> this<00:06:04.979> real<00:06:05.190> quick<00:06:08.510> so

00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:09.510 
gonna have to adjust this real quick so

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:11.570 
gonna have to adjust this real quick so
I<00:06:09.810> took<00:06:09.870> the<00:06:10.140> handguard<00:06:10.890> off<00:06:11.100> of<00:06:11.310> that<00:06:11.460> and

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:11.580 
I took the handguard off of that and

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:15.130 
I took the handguard off of that and
everything<00:06:11.940> like<00:06:12.030> that<00:06:12.650> so<00:06:13.650> just<00:06:14.040> to<00:06:14.400> show<00:06:14.640> you

00:06:15.130 --> 00:06:15.140 
everything like that so just to show you

00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:18.290 
everything like that so just to show you
this<00:06:16.140> is<00:06:16.380> just<00:06:16.500> a<00:06:16.650> standard<00:06:16.880> m4a1<00:06:17.880> length

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:18.300 
this is just a standard m4a1 length

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:20.810 
this is just a standard m4a1 length
outer<00:06:18.479> barrel<00:06:18.870> and<00:06:19.590> power<00:06:20.130> to<00:06:20.310> put<00:06:20.490> that<00:06:20.640> on

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:20.820 
outer barrel and power to put that on

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:23.960 
outer barrel and power to put that on
here<00:06:21.060> it'll<00:06:21.660> leave<00:06:21.960> me<00:06:22.140> about<00:06:22.669> half<00:06:23.669> an<00:06:23.820> inch

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:23.970 
here it'll leave me about half an inch

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:27.020 
here it'll leave me about half an inch
left<00:06:24.270> on<00:06:24.419> the<00:06:24.540> outer<00:06:24.660> barrel<00:06:25.110> and<00:06:25.789> one<00:06:26.789> and<00:06:26.970> a

00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:27.030 
left on the outer barrel and one and a

00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:27.540 
left on the outer barrel and one and a
half<00:06:27.060> inch

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:27.550 
half inch

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:29.790 
half inch
including<00:06:28.090> the<00:06:28.180> orange<00:06:28.390> tip<00:06:28.660> so<00:06:29.470> that's<00:06:29.650> just

00:06:29.790 --> 00:06:29.800 
including the orange tip so that's just

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:31.530 
including the orange tip so that's just
compared<00:06:30.220> to<00:06:30.490> that

00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:31.540 
compared to that

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:33.750 
compared to that
so<00:06:31.810> pumping<00:06:32.230> it<00:06:32.410> on<00:06:32.560> f-16<00:06:33.310> length<00:06:33.550> outer

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:33.760 
so pumping it on f-16 length outer

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:36.270 
so pumping it on f-16 length outer
barrel<00:06:34.060> which<00:06:34.180> I<00:06:34.270> believe<00:06:34.510> was<00:06:34.690> 20<00:06:35.050> inches<00:06:35.440> it

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:36.280 
barrel which I believe was 20 inches it

00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:38.310 
barrel which I believe was 20 inches it
should<00:06:36.610> look<00:06:36.730> pretty<00:06:37.150> nice<00:06:37.360> like<00:06:37.840> I<00:06:38.050> said

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:38.320 
should look pretty nice like I said

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:42.720 
should look pretty nice like I said
should<00:06:38.620> look<00:06:38.770> like<00:06:38.800> a<00:06:40.410> like<00:06:41.410> a<00:06:41.620> canopy<00:06:42.490> way

00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:42.730 
should look like a like a canopy way

00:06:42.730 --> 00:06:45.990 
should look like a like a canopy way
that's<00:06:43.000> our<00:06:43.180> 12<00:06:44.280> so<00:06:45.280> if<00:06:45.550> you<00:06:45.640> don't<00:06:45.790> know<00:06:45.880> if

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:46.000 
that's our 12 so if you don't know if

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.120 
that's our 12 so if you don't know if
that<00:06:46.180> is<00:06:46.420> just<00:06:46.450> go<00:06:46.900> ahead<00:06:47.020> and<00:06:47.320> google<00:06:47.740> it<00:06:47.860> just

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:48.130 
that is just go ahead and google it just

00:06:48.130 --> 00:06:51.420 
that is just go ahead and google it just
to<00:06:48.220> give<00:06:48.400> you<00:06:48.520> an<00:06:48.820> example<00:06:49.210> and<00:06:50.220> so<00:06:51.220> that's

00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:51.430 
to give you an example and so that's

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:53.580 
to give you an example and so that's
what<00:06:51.580> to<00:06:51.700> expect<00:06:52.180> if<00:06:52.660> I<00:06:52.810> do<00:06:52.870> order<00:06:53.290> it<00:06:53.380> today

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:53.590 
what to expect if I do order it today

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:56.220 
what to expect if I do order it today
being<00:06:54.190> Sunday<00:06:54.550> or<00:06:54.850> tomorrow<00:06:55.240> Monday<00:06:55.690> it

should come next week Monday or Tuesday

00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:01.350 
should come next week Monday or Tuesday
and<00:06:59.170> I'll<00:06:59.650> probably<00:06:59.770> have<00:07:00.040> me<00:07:00.790> building<00:07:01.180> it

00:07:01.350 --> 00:07:01.360 
and I'll probably have me building it

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:03.300 
and I'll probably have me building it
and<00:07:01.600> I'm<00:07:01.720> gonna<00:07:01.870> have<00:07:02.050> a<00:07:02.290> few<00:07:02.710> internal

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:03.310 
and I'm gonna have a few internal

00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:05.940 
and I'm gonna have a few internal
upgrades<00:07:03.430> and<00:07:04.030> mainly<00:07:04.840> kind<00:07:05.500> of<00:07:05.590> cosmetic

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:05.950 
upgrades and mainly kind of cosmetic

00:07:05.950 --> 00:07:09.030 
upgrades and mainly kind of cosmetic
bite<00:07:06.750> DMR<00:07:07.750> kind<00:07:07.990> of<00:07:08.050> looks<00:07:08.230> and<00:07:08.530> everything<00:07:08.650> to

00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:09.040 
bite DMR kind of looks and everything to

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:12.180 
bite DMR kind of looks and everything to
it<00:07:09.190> so<00:07:10.140> it<00:07:11.140> won't<00:07:11.290> be<00:07:11.410> like<00:07:11.560> a<00:07:11.590> little<00:07:11.920> project

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:12.190 
it so it won't be like a little project

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:13.740 
it so it won't be like a little project
it's<00:07:12.790> not<00:07:12.910> like<00:07:13.060> a<00:07:13.090> challenge<00:07:13.480> kit<00:07:13.660> or

00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:13.750 
it's not like a challenge kit or

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:15.630 
it's not like a challenge kit or
anything<00:07:13.900> like<00:07:14.080> that<00:07:14.140> it's<00:07:14.470> just<00:07:14.500> making<00:07:15.430> it

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:15.640 
anything like that it's just making it

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:19.230 
anything like that it's just making it
more<00:07:15.910> how<00:07:16.180> I<00:07:16.210> want<00:07:16.660> it<00:07:16.840> so<00:07:17.970> once<00:07:18.970> I<00:07:19.090> do<00:07:19.150> that

00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:19.240 
more how I want it so once I do that

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:21.060 
more how I want it so once I do that
I'll<00:07:19.630> have<00:07:19.870> shooting<00:07:20.320> videos<00:07:20.650> and<00:07:20.950> reviews

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:21.070 
I'll have shooting videos and reviews

00:07:21.070 --> 00:07:22.920 
I'll have shooting videos and reviews
and<00:07:21.640> maybe<00:07:21.820> some<00:07:22.060> gameplay<00:07:22.390> footage

00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:22.930 
and maybe some gameplay footage

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:25.320 
and maybe some gameplay footage
so<00:07:23.500> that's<00:07:24.130> that<00:07:24.460> that's<00:07:24.640> a<00:07:24.790> little<00:07:24.940> update

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:25.330 
so that's that that's a little update

00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:26.970 
so that's that that's a little update
and<00:07:25.600> that's<00:07:26.050> why<00:07:26.380> I<00:07:26.410> haven't<00:07:26.710> uploaded
