00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:13.530 
deep colors and a nice balanced pattern
and<00:02:09.970> of<00:02:10.600> course<00:02:10.869> the<00:02:11.410> the<00:02:12.310> body<00:02:12.880> shape<00:02:13.240> should

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:13.540 
and of course the the body shape should

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.420 
and of course the the body shape should
be<00:02:13.630> right<00:02:13.870> you<00:02:14.080> want<00:02:14.290> to<00:02:14.380> double<00:02:14.890> check<00:02:14.920> real

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
be right you want to double check real

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:17.730 
be right you want to double check real
close<00:02:15.700> sometimes<00:02:16.270> you<00:02:16.450> can<00:02:16.600> get<00:02:16.720> fooled<00:02:17.050> by<00:02:17.319> a

00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:17.740 
close sometimes you can get fooled by a

00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:19.710 
close sometimes you can get fooled by a
nice<00:02:18.010> pattern<00:02:18.580> but<00:02:18.760> you<00:02:18.790> look<00:02:19.030> closer<00:02:19.330> and<00:02:19.600> the

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
nice pattern but you look closer and the

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.220 
nice pattern but you look closer and the
body<00:02:19.930> shape<00:02:20.050> might<00:02:20.500> be<00:02:20.650> off<00:02:20.800> right<00:02:21.010> absolutely

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
body shape might be off right absolutely

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:25.320 
body shape might be off right absolutely
like<00:02:23.230> example<00:02:23.620> here<00:02:23.950> we<00:02:24.040> got<00:02:24.220> a<00:02:24.250> really<00:02:25.090> nice

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:25.330 
like example here we got a really nice

00:02:25.330 --> 00:02:26.580 
like example here we got a really nice
little<00:02:25.510> show<00:02:25.840> right<00:02:26.080> here<00:02:26.230> but<00:02:26.410> if<00:02:26.470> you<00:02:26.560> look

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:26.590 
little show right here but if you look

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.370 
little show right here but if you look
real<00:02:26.980> close<00:02:27.250> you<00:02:27.280> see<00:02:28.209> how<00:02:28.330> is<00:02:28.569> the<00:02:28.930> head<00:02:29.140> and

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:29.380 
real close you see how is the head and

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:31.740 
real close you see how is the head and
bone<00:02:29.709> structures<00:02:30.250> turn<00:02:30.580> out<00:02:30.760> yeah<00:02:31.540> it's<00:02:31.690> a

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750 
bone structures turn out yeah it's a

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.210 
bone structures turn out yeah it's a
little<00:02:31.990> crooked<00:02:32.230> and<00:02:32.530> that's<00:02:32.680> actually<00:02:32.920> a

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
little crooked and that's actually a

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.120 
little crooked and that's actually a
very<00:02:33.880> common<00:02:34.810> thing<00:02:35.020> with<00:02:35.230> show<00:02:35.470> uh<00:02:35.500> yes<00:02:35.980> I

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130 
very common thing with show uh yes I

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.190 
very common thing with show uh yes I
have<00:02:36.490> a<00:02:36.520> crooked<00:02:36.819> head<00:02:37.240> you<00:02:37.660> want<00:02:37.810> to<00:02:37.959> look

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:38.200 
have a crooked head you want to look

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.320 
have a crooked head you want to look
close<00:02:38.560> don't<00:02:38.920> be<00:02:39.130> just<00:02:39.550> attracted<00:02:40.120> by<00:02:40.270> the

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
close don't be just attracted by the

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.390 
close don't be just attracted by the
pattern<00:02:40.900> and<00:02:41.050> the<00:02:41.140> coloring<00:02:41.500> I<00:02:41.680> can<00:02:41.950> throw<00:02:42.190> it

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:42.400 
pattern and the coloring I can throw it

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.130 
pattern and the coloring I can throw it
in<00:02:42.610> this<00:02:42.790> wood<00:02:43.060> this<00:02:43.330> is<00:02:43.390> actually<00:02:43.900> a<00:02:43.930> really

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
in this wood this is actually a really

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.680 
in this wood this is actually a really
good<00:02:44.470> representation<00:02:44.980> of<00:02:45.640> a<00:02:46.209> fish<00:02:46.390> that<00:02:46.599> would

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:46.690 
good representation of a fish that would

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:49.589 
good representation of a fish that would
do<00:02:46.870> exactly<00:02:47.349> that<00:02:47.440> because<00:02:47.830> it's<00:02:48.190> very<00:02:48.599> all

00:02:49.589 --> 00:02:49.599 
do exactly that because it's very all

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:53.100 
do exactly that because it's very all
you<00:02:50.319> know<00:02:50.470> sparkly<00:02:51.190> the<00:02:51.340> Sumi<00:02:51.819> on<00:02:52.000> it<00:02:52.180> is<00:02:52.750> very

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:53.110 
you know sparkly the Sumi on it is very

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.380 
you know sparkly the Sumi on it is very
very<00:02:53.319> nice<00:02:53.650> come<00:02:54.160> here<00:02:54.340> look

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:55.390 
very nice come here look

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:56.790 
very nice come here look
you'll<00:02:55.480> think<00:02:55.720> it's<00:02:55.960> nice<00:02:56.170> and<00:02:56.410> look<00:02:56.560> closer

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:56.800 
you'll think it's nice and look closer

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.449 
you'll think it's nice and look closer
so<00:02:57.190> yeah<00:02:57.640> that<00:02:58.090> that<00:02:58.360> fish<00:02:58.630> is<00:02:58.900> pretty<00:02:59.170> but<00:02:59.680> not

00:03:00.449 --> 00:03:00.459 
so yeah that that fish is pretty but not

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:02.610 
so yeah that that fish is pretty but not
very<00:03:00.700> cooperative<00:03:00.940> but<00:03:01.540> it<00:03:01.750> is<00:03:01.900> pretty<00:03:02.110> spend

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.620 
very cooperative but it is pretty spend

very cooperative but it is pretty spend
a<00:03:02.709> lot<00:03:02.890> of<00:03:03.010> money<00:03:03.190> on<00:03:03.370> a<00:03:03.400> fish<00:03:03.640> like<00:03:03.880> that<00:03:03.910> right

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:04.780 
a lot of money on a fish like that right

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:06.510 
a lot of money on a fish like that right
but<00:03:05.020> look<00:03:05.170> at<00:03:05.319> that<00:03:05.440> suma<00:03:05.890> that's<00:03:06.010> very<00:03:06.280> nice

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:06.520 
but look at that suma that's very nice

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:09.449 
but look at that suma that's very nice
great<00:03:07.180> nice<00:03:07.900> red<00:03:08.260> even<00:03:08.530> the<00:03:08.650> patterns<00:03:09.069> do<00:03:09.250> now

00:03:09.449 --> 00:03:09.459 
great nice red even the patterns do now

00:03:09.459 --> 00:03:11.220 
great nice red even the patterns do now
because<00:03:09.850> of<00:03:10.240> the<00:03:10.330> bone<00:03:10.540> structure<00:03:11.080> that

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.230 
because of the bone structure that

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:12.810 
because of the bone structure that
fishing<00:03:11.680> yeah<00:03:11.890> you<00:03:12.130> could<00:03:12.280> see<00:03:12.520> it's<00:03:12.670> actually

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:12.820 
fishing yeah you could see it's actually

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:15.240 
fishing yeah you could see it's actually
a<00:03:13.060> little<00:03:13.300> deformed<00:03:13.720> right<00:03:13.990> here<00:03:14.530> you<00:03:15.070> can<00:03:15.220> see

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:15.250 
a little deformed right here you can see

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:16.980 
a little deformed right here you can see
where<00:03:15.640> it<00:03:15.730> actually<00:03:16.090> sticks<00:03:16.480> out<00:03:16.660> a<00:03:16.720> little

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:16.990 
where it actually sticks out a little

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:18.480 
where it actually sticks out a little
bit<00:03:17.260> I<00:03:17.290> don't<00:03:17.500> know<00:03:17.709> if<00:03:17.830> you<00:03:17.950> can<00:03:18.100> see<00:03:18.310> that

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:18.490 
bit I don't know if you can see that

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:21.000 
bit I don't know if you can see that
gene<00:03:18.820> if<00:03:19.630> you<00:03:19.810> can<00:03:19.900> get<00:03:20.020> a<00:03:20.050> close-up<00:03:20.350> on<00:03:20.709> let's

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:21.010 
gene if you can get a close-up on let's

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:22.199 
gene if you can get a close-up on let's
see<00:03:21.130> if<00:03:21.190> we<00:03:21.310> can<00:03:21.430> calm<00:03:21.580> them<00:03:21.760> back<00:03:22.000> down

00:03:22.199 --> 00:03:22.209 
see if we can calm them back down

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:24.210 
see if we can calm them back down
that'll<00:03:22.630> keep<00:03:22.840> that<00:03:23.080> fish<00:03:23.320> in<00:03:23.530> about<00:03:23.770> a<00:03:23.800> twenty

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:24.220 
that'll keep that fish in about a twenty

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.670 
that'll keep that fish in about a twenty
dollar<00:03:24.489> value<00:03:24.910> because<00:03:25.239> because<00:03:26.110> of<00:03:26.260> that<00:03:26.380> one

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:26.680 
dollar value because because of that one

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.880 
dollar value because because of that one
and<00:03:27.640> that's<00:03:27.790> you<00:03:28.209> know<00:03:28.270> it's<00:03:28.570> it's<00:03:29.380> good<00:03:29.590> and

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:29.890 
and that's you know it's it's good and

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:32.130 
and that's you know it's it's good and
it's<00:03:30.070> a<00:03:30.160> shame<00:03:30.370> but<00:03:30.580> it's<00:03:30.760> actually<00:03:31.300> you<00:03:32.110> know

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:32.140 
it's a shame but it's actually you know

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:33.509 
it's a shame but it's actually you know
I'd<00:03:32.320> like<00:03:32.470> to<00:03:32.530> also<00:03:32.709> point<00:03:32.920> out<00:03:33.250> though<00:03:33.370> it's

00:03:33.509 --> 00:03:33.519 
I'd like to also point out though it's

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:36.030 
I'd like to also point out though it's
not<00:03:33.670> a<00:03:33.730> bad<00:03:33.970> starter<00:03:34.480> fish<00:03:34.720> yeah<00:03:35.410> but<00:03:35.739> somebody

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:36.040 
not a bad starter fish yeah but somebody

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.370 
not a bad starter fish yeah but somebody
just<00:03:36.100> getting<00:03:36.550> started<00:03:36.970> in<00:03:37.060> the<00:03:37.180> hobby<00:03:37.390> you

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:38.380 
just getting started in the hobby you

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:39.690 
just getting started in the hobby you
know<00:03:38.410> that<00:03:38.680> would<00:03:38.830> be<00:03:38.860> a<00:03:39.010> fish<00:03:39.370> that<00:03:39.550> they<00:03:39.670> can

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:39.700 
know that would be a fish that they can

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.479 
know that would be a fish that they can
write<00:03:40.269> yes<00:03:40.660> pretty<00:03:41.200> there's<00:03:42.100> something<00:03:42.430> they

00:03:42.479 --> 00:03:42.489 
write yes pretty there's something they

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:44.580 
write yes pretty there's something they
can<00:03:42.640> learn<00:03:42.790> from<00:03:43.090> it<00:03:43.209> so<00:03:43.540> let's<00:03:44.380> say<00:03:44.560> for

00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:44.590 
can learn from it so let's say for

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:46.530 
can learn from it so let's say for
example<00:03:44.830> mixed<00:03:45.640> well<00:03:45.850> now<00:03:45.880> that<00:03:46.150> we've<00:03:46.269> priced

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:46.540 
example mixed well now that we've priced

got nice fins the fins are clear the
pattern<00:05:07.880> is<00:05:08.000> balanced<00:05:08.510> from<00:05:08.600> a<00:05:08.750> head<00:05:08.960> to<00:05:09.170> tails

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:09.500 
pattern is balanced from a head to tails

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:12.330 
pattern is balanced from a head to tails
side<00:05:09.920> to<00:05:10.190> side<00:05:10.430> and<00:05:10.820> the<00:05:11.450> color<00:05:11.690> is<00:05:11.810> nice

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:14.830 
side to side and the color is nice
deeper<00:05:13.340> color<00:05:13.580> in<00:05:13.760> fact<00:05:14.000> this<00:05:14.240> kind<00:05:14.480> of<00:05:14.570> color

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:14.840 
deeper color in fact this kind of color

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:16.750 
deeper color in fact this kind of color
on<00:05:15.020> this<00:05:15.170> fish<00:05:15.380> can<00:05:15.650> actually<00:05:16.010> improve<00:05:16.340> over

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:16.760 
on this fish can actually improve over

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:18.520 
on this fish can actually improve over
time<00:05:16.790> if<00:05:17.480> you<00:05:17.600> look<00:05:17.750> at<00:05:17.870> this<00:05:18.020> little<00:05:18.200> gray

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:18.530 
time if you look at this little gray

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:20.770 
time if you look at this little gray
area<00:05:18.560> here<00:05:19.040> in<00:05:19.370> the<00:05:19.490> white<00:05:19.670> that<00:05:20.450> can<00:05:20.630> actually

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:20.780 
area here in the white that can actually

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:22.660 
area here in the white that can actually
become<00:05:21.050> darker<00:05:21.710> with<00:05:21.890> age<00:05:22.070> and<00:05:22.370> get<00:05:22.460> a<00:05:22.490> little

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:22.670 
become darker with age and get a little

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:25.660 
become darker with age and get a little
more<00:05:23.410> black<00:05:24.410> color<00:05:24.980> in<00:05:25.130> that<00:05:25.160> area<00:05:25.460> so<00:05:25.550> it'll

00:05:25.660 --> 00:05:25.670 
more black color in that area so it'll

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:27.370 
more black color in that area so it'll
help<00:05:25.820> to<00:05:26.030> balance<00:05:26.420> a<00:05:26.510> fish<00:05:26.720> out<00:05:26.900> look<00:05:27.110> even

any color including black game that's a

tells you that that that fish is a

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:47.560 
tells you that that that fish is a
little<00:05:44.930> more<00:05:45.170> refined<00:05:45.680> the<00:05:46.360> genetics<00:05:47.360> of<00:05:47.450> the

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:47.570 
little more refined the genetics of the

00:05:47.570 --> 00:05:50.230 
little more refined the genetics of the
fish<00:05:47.780> or<00:05:47.990> a<00:05:48.020> higher<00:05:48.290> quality<00:05:48.890> show<00:05:49.760> up<00:05:49.940> okay

fish or a higher quality show up okay

00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:53.200 
fish or a higher quality show up okay
for<00:05:50.930> Kohaku<00:05:51.500> or<00:05:51.890> something<00:05:52.370> or<00:05:52.520> any<00:05:52.940> of<00:05:53.120> the

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:53.210 
for Kohaku or something or any of the

00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:56.110 
for Kohaku or something or any of the
above<00:05:53.510> okay<00:05:53.950> so<00:05:54.950> clear<00:05:55.250> fins<00:05:55.520> are<00:05:55.700> important

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:56.120 
above okay so clear fins are important

00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:58.210 
above okay so clear fins are important
so<00:05:56.210> sometimes<00:05:56.690> it's<00:05:56.900> a<00:05:56.990> small<00:05:57.680> detail<00:05:57.950> that

00:05:58.210 --> 00:05:58.220 
so sometimes it's a small detail that

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:00.820 
so sometimes it's a small detail that
can<00:05:58.490> make<00:05:58.670> a<00:05:58.700> big<00:05:58.790> difference<00:05:59.150> in<00:05:59.660> a<00:05:59.960> price<00:06:00.230> and

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:00.830 
can make a big difference in a price and

can make a big difference in a price and
