00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:12.459
 I said it's one that has been around 

00:00:11.349 --> 00:00:14.619
 this time is a very man 

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:16.000
 disciplined I believe unlike what 

00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:18.880
 what dennis says is that it was not so 

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.759
 unexpected and I think that leaving it in 

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.470
 administer occupant the question no yo 

00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:25.360
 I think that's what worries me 

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:27.790
 it seems that it was not so unexpected for the 

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.559
 International Book Fair is going to 

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:31.689
 ask about books because you are reading 

00:00:29.559 --> 00:00:34.540
 or what books have you read or what are your 

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:37.329
 favorite authors let's make it a 

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:38.950
 voracious reader or do not think that that's 

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:44.610
 irrelevant is completely irrelevant 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:44.610
 when it comes to governing well or badly 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:52.539
 I think they do not represent anything 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:57.839
 noun because a good part of the 

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:57.839
 criticism in social networks and politicians 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:04.080
 the dislate of peña grandson these people 

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:06.840
 who have no idea of ​​the book of 

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.570
 What do I say, grandson of the authors who 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.970
 confused that they have no idea of 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:15.150
 who was I do not know to say something if 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:18.270
 they did not have the slightest idea of 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.850
 what a storybook ever 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:25.369
 they read rulfo to start things for 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.369
 the style is to say ignorance 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:33.860
 there was never a more democratic election 

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:37.640
 and tumultuaria that the one that took adolfo 

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:39.920
 hitler to power falsity of the adolfo 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:42.380
 I'll take you with 30 percent of the 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.920
 votes has never been there after 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:50.530
 some rubies so many votes in germany 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:50.530
 always the most there were absolute majorities 

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.479
 but here is your low note 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:05.350
 I love when they pass 

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:12.860
 for them 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.340
 enrique peña grandson- the gallant of gallants 

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:34.310
 normally the one with which they paid you game 

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:39.420
 so 

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.420
 yes 

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:46.930
 is a teflon candidate did not know the three 

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:48.610
 books that had most impacted him 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:51.100
 knew well at the beginning that there was 

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:53.290
 dead his first wife said no the 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:55.780
 that was not the lady of the house I think 

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:59.020
 Well, the watering comes saying 

00:02:55.780 --> 00:03:01.900
 wrong things wrong ignorance 

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:03.310
 etcetera the one that is a bad candidate in 

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:04.630
 a match that could have better 

00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.040
 changes 

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:08.700
 and it really is a show 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:08.700
 memorable 

00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:14.890
 you can not technology technology and two 

00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:20.520
 engines machines and high tech gadgets 

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:20.520
 innovative boat energies processes 

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:26.819
 I have seen laura bozzo speaking Latin 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.890
 and being a Latin Mass 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:32.920
 ora pro nobis well better 

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:36.430
 good because politicians because 

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:38.830
 they do not have a minimal sense of ridicule 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:41.530
 someone can not tell a grandson 

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:43.900
 to uncover in the recording enrique no 

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:45.580
 speak more in English not here to whom 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:47.680
 you are convincing those you speak 

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:50.400
 English to those who speak English 

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.400
 It's scary 

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:56.470
 Sunday at dawn Paulina Peña 

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:58.300
 retweet and a message written by your 

00:03:56.470 --> 00:04:00.130
 boyfriend a greeting to the whole ball of 

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:03.510
 assholes that are part of the offspring and 

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:03.510
 they only criticize who in videos 

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:11.580
 and here 

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:32.320
 or 

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.210
 go 

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:53.669
 go for a week 

00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.669
 outside 

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:14.350
 ah 

00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:43.510
 I am a law student I am 

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:45.790
 Cordovan also the same as it is because 

00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:48.550
 or under what right you can ask that the 

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:52.480
 people go from the street to you in 

00:05:48.550 --> 00:05:54.130
 no interview because I'm under what 

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:57.150
 right can you mobilize people 

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:57.150
 Yes sir 

00:05:57.370 --> 00:06:01.350
 because a young girl is hitting me 

00:06:04.770 --> 00:06:09.790
 this is a purely political question 

00:06:08.050 --> 00:06:12.220
 because in the USA and a candidate for 

00:06:09.790 --> 00:06:14.110
 example to the presidency will accept that 

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:17.710
 had children out of wedlock and so on 

00:06:14.110 --> 00:06:20.070
 politically it would be perhaps eliminated 

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:23.080
 do you think these thorny issues 

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:25.480
 they must be relevant to voters 

00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:28.090
 here in Mexico mira is a definition of 

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:32.290
 the voters of the subjects of life 

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:35.290
 I have touched them and I have spoken with 

00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:37.540
 all amplitude are not topics that I would like 

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:41.290
 play recurrently about it but 

00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:43.300
 they are going to take it out are topics to see are 

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:47.620
 topics that have been I was the one who touched 

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:49.750
 the theme originally and it is not a theme 

00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:51.460
 who wants to talk recurrently 

00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:53.440
 out of respect for privacy should be 

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:55.210
 part of the voters' dialogue 

00:06:53.440 --> 00:06:59.020
 Mexicans, I think that what matters to 

00:06:55.210 --> 00:07:01.090
 the Mexicans is that I can expect from 

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:03.460
 an option that today presents itself to me 

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:05.740
 to change my reality what is it that 

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:07.240
 will allow you to find jobs that 

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:08.979
 that will allow to find education 

00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:11.560
 that's the answers that I am are made 

00:07:08.979 --> 00:07:14.190
 today the electorate and they are the ones that have to be 

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:14.190
 answer them 

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:28.970
 It is also very easy to alter a 

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:28.970
 vital encounter but to me 

00:07:37.139 --> 00:07:39.710
 Y 

00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:45.660
 plus 

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:48.660
 Y 

00:07:45.660 --> 00:07:48.660
 ah
