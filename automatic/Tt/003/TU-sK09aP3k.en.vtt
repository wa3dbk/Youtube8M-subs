00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:16.520
 hello welcome to my beige game 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:18.320
 as you have already seen the game that 

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:21.020
 we will try during this month of January 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:24.050
 2014 first month of the year will be the eclipse 

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:26.000
 the first game of 2014 is a game 

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:28.340
 highly expected by some and the 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.520
 truth is that it is a great game in all 

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:33.320
 every eclipse rule is a game of 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:35.570
 resource management in the purest style 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.130
 but set in space we 

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.379
 will allow to go driving different 

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:41.210
 resources 3 specifically to be able 

00:00:39.379 --> 00:00:43.160
 advance in our conquest of the 

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:45.350
 galaxy and also be able to evolve 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:47.179
 both in technology and in armament 

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:48.620
 of course to be able to face 

00:00:47.179 --> 00:00:50.490
 the dangers and perhaps the others 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.620
 players 

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:55.910
 The truth is that it reminds me of a 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:58.800
 old dpc game a called meeting 

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:02.510
 where we had a style 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.650
 civilization but in space I 

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.240
 remember I did not protect that key from 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:08.760
 what but this reminds me of this great game 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.740
 and it brings back good memories of the 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:13.470
 childhood, of course, the game in Spain 

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:15.570
 it distributes the models and comes 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.360
 translated into Spanish although the box 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:21.020
 we still see traits like the edition to 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.060
 the original publisher 

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:25.189
 it's a pretty showy game with a 

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.619
 board in these hexagonal pieces 

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:29.090
 hexagonal that will mount the map and 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:31.189
 mix a little the famous cubes of 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.829
 wood that we will use to control 

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:36.469
 the resources with plastic ships 

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:38.780
 plastic figures for the let's say that 

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:40.700
 the military part is a game that how much 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:44.240
 more players more fun allows them 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:47.929
 play from 3 would be no minimum what 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:50.270
 minimum advisable up to 7 because with 

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:52.189
 the expansions we can expand this 

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.599
 number to spend 6 and with the 

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:56.689
 expansions we can expand this number 

00:01:53.599 --> 00:02:01.220
 up to 9 tells us for somewhere here 

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:02.720
 you have it from 2 to 6 for 14 years or more and 

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:04.970
 30 minutes curiously the duration 

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.189
 indicates 30 minutes per player and these 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:09.259
 they are so many changes now we go for 

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:10.910
 parts first of all I've done like 

00:02:09.259 --> 00:02:13.040
 all in three players here we go that 

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.380
 two said it may play 2 , but the 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:16.700
 game loses enough is quite less 

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.010
 exciting in fact there are certain rules 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.379
 that with two and some even with three 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:23.450
 players does not have no place like 

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:25.040
 for example alliances or the phase of 

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.469
 let's say diplomatic 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:30.140
 It would no longer be from three players and 

00:02:27.469 --> 00:02:31.730
 up to 66 is a very good number is not 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.349
 like other games that so many 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:34.849
 players already starts to be a 

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:37.489
 hotchpotch and have then been 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:39.290
 complicated 16 players is very well I 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:40.670
 I would say that it is almost optimal with 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.439
 expansions as I say when it will expand 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:44.689
 up to 9 and there it is already a bit 

00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:46.790
 spend in fact use the rules 

00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:49.370
 specials also to speed up a little 

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:51.620
 the general heading that tells us here 

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:53.420
 14 years or more good 14 years is a little 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:55.370
 exaggerated the game does not have a theme 

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.950
 rare has no monsters or anything like 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.389
 and good is the typical management game 

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:01.000
 resources is worth the 8 year old 

00:02:59.389 --> 00:03:05.060
 Equals it to understand some things 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:06.889
 but in 14 it seems to me exaggerated and 

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.780
 last 30 minutes per player that is 

00:03:06.889 --> 00:03:11.269
 very curious that duration is more or less 

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.409
 reality and is that this game to 

00:03:11.269 --> 00:03:13.730
 Unlike other management 

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:16.280
 resources has a number of shifts 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:18.409
 limited nine innings are played 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:20.329
 eclipse and here at the end of the nine 

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:22.790
 turns get more victory points 

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:25.340
 will be creator going down not the goal 

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:26.959
 military to destroy others or to 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.580
 that will be able to play until a 

00:03:26.959 --> 00:03:30.400
 point where we want to lay the no 

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:32.330
 the game came limited nine turns 

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.670
 as we have precisely this 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:36.680
 limitation of nine shifts and this one is 

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:38.000
 concrete length at nine shifts yes that 

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.580
 the half hour is well posed 

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.680
 per player more or less dividing the 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:44.030
 nine turns of each player the number 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.100
 of players yes that we can leave a 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:48.350
 half an hour for each one of them for 

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:51.200
 so much that we played two a hour should 

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:52.820
 give us playing 3 hours and a half maybe a 

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:55.940
 little bit more depends the players is 

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:58.360
 well if we play 6 then the three hours 

00:03:55.940 --> 00:04:02.090
 no one is going to take them away from us because if 

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:04.040
 We went on foot to much more 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:05.120
 to many more cabals to know what 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:06.410
 we can do also depend the 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.750
 players players like dani that already 

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:10.400
 you know comes from all parts of 

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:12.260
 the player makes the game late 

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.730
 little more but good is also true 

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.230
 which is a game that would be quite 

00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:17.389
 coconut and that of new after player the 

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:19.160
 decisions of the other players we 

00:04:17.389 --> 00:04:20.900
 they can vary the one we go to 

00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:24.080
 take us you will see during the 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:26.300
 turn because it's a very curious turn very 

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:30.350
 interesting that arises in a way 

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:31.880
 in which we do not have very clear not 

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:32.930
 we can be so clear about what we are going to 

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:34.910
 do here what fixed in the next turn 

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:36.680
 because all the players will go before 

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:38.810
 that we so many times in our 

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:41.600
 next round and be able to make us vary 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:43.010
 what we want to do but good this 

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:45.530
 we will talk with the rules and the shifts 

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:47.660
 we say that equipment is a game very very 

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:49.460
 Good highly recommended especially if you 

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:51.050
 like the topic of resource management and 

00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:53.300
 also if you like the theme is very 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:54.789
 well set and it is not done at all 

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:57.710
 heavy there are games of this style 

00:04:54.789 --> 00:04:59.330
 civilization without going any further than they can 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:00.949
 make very long games or parts a 

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:03.620
 little heavy is not the case of eclipse at 

00:05:00.949 --> 00:05:05.539
 have this limitation is more in many 

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:07.250
 games the nine shifts happened to us 

00:05:05.539 --> 00:05:08.210
 very quickly there came a bunch that we say 

00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:09.770
 my mother what 

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:12.020
 so I have not done anything that 

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:13.819
 I wanted to do it will force us to be a little 

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:15.830
 more dynamic and hurry a bit and also 

00:05:13.819 --> 00:05:17.419
 allows us to limit our 

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:20.360
 field of action and not extend until 

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:22.849
 Infinite good as we'll see what 

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:24.620
 poses us during this this month this 

00:05:22.849 --> 00:05:26.419
 great game of nine we can 

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:28.039
 get in our park our country 

00:05:26.419 --> 00:05:30.289
 through the Nobel and in our store 

00:05:28.039 --> 00:05:33.199
 you can get it of course both he 

00:05:30.289 --> 00:05:35.030
 as its expansion that could be said 

00:05:33.199 --> 00:05:36.949
 your personals that we will talk to 

00:05:35.030 --> 00:05:38.690
 end of month this month this month also 

00:05:36.949 --> 00:05:40.460
 we have a somewhat long game all 

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:42.949
 you have to say it because as it is nine 

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:45.620
 quite extensive shifts but surely 

00:05:42.949 --> 00:05:47.930
 it's very interesting because we put 

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:50.530
 tomorrow the contents of the box thank you 

00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:50.530
 for your time
