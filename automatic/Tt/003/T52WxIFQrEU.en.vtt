00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.549
 that's it so today I 'm going 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:07.649
 share my homemade burgers recipe this 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:08.730
 are in my opinion the best the 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:10.889
 houses there is a hotel 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:12.179
 so for me they are very simple you 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:13.349
 want to garnish as you wish 

00:00:12.179 --> 00:00:17.100
 but I'll show you how I 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:20.420
 complainants so let's go for the 

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:23.519
 recipe you will need to hide 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:28.650
 ten people are dying of a little bit of 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:31.560
 Berder cheese bacon salad 

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.940
 some onions and finally for me 

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.700
 I chose to associate barbecue but 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:37.200
 you chase what you want so that 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.930
 if optional but I took 

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.250
 the usual pastry court stops 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:43.500
 to crush a little bit the chopped steak 

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:45.300
 so that it is less tools and that's it 

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.519
 two there are going to say a little bit so much 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.300
 more than I took hamburgers form 

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:52.440
 maxi so that's it's just for 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:54.269
 expand it a little bit knowing 

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.360
 only after cooking they shrink 

00:00:54.269 --> 00:00:59.550
 a lot I then go back my 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.409
 onions in the pan so for 

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.820
 the surfer on me I show what 

00:01:01.409 --> 00:01:05.159
 I used to use ie 

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:07.049
 pretty simple but everything is optional 

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.430
 learn Berber reason you know 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:10.530
 you choose what you dream but 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.030
 tesco according to the waters after the 

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.830
 chose hide yourself been very well 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.960
 choose chicken or any 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.479
 Poultry that is to your taste and 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.700
 acquired 20 lengths then make small 

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:22.770
 trick to give your 15 hours of 

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.510
 tig or pay onions these two streets 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.220
 soak a little while in the pan where 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:28.640
 you have the same pan you did 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.590
 return your onions so let 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.420
 just a few seconds just 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.860
 the time that his grid slightly embed 

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.200
 the same for all bettors 

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.090
 we then come to cook the steaks 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.040
 chopped so for that nothing 

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:44.390
 of extraordinary or clear fart like 

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.390
 usual epicure 

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:49.670
 and to finish I 'm coming back 

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:51.020
 a few slices of bacon so that's it 

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.880
 fast I advise you to do it at 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:57.410
 last moment since that then very quickly 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.760
 peel a little barbecue sauce on 

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:00.860
 the pairs now I'm going to come them 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:03.610
 garnish except that small mistake I 

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:06.200
 forgot some talents 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.850
 the cheese of course 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.830
 so I catch up with my mistake it's not 

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:12.380
 very serious so I'm on edge on every 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:13.160
 part of the pines so under the stand by 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:15.350
 on the steak 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.940
 I made my brother to states 

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:20.120

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:22.300

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:33.260
 oven for ten minutes at 150 degrees 

00:02:29.209 --> 00:02:34.580
 just so that the cheese melted well one 

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.500
 times your burgers and prices do not 

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:38.300
 remains more than to garnish it so for that 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.700

 Here he'll just fate 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.120
