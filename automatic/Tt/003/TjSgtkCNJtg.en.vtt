00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:14.220
 girls today I'm going to teach you 

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:16.950
 how to make a 

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:20.370
 catÃ£o wide waterfall that one that goes 

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:21.780
 falling super simple and easy as well 

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:24.570
 video super fast come on we go 

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:26.430
 need current 

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.660
 this will be the basis of current 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:33.150
 main 

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:42.110
 I already put it closed she comes here I already 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:42.110
 I put the clasp and the loose chain is 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:58.230
 a plier to cut and hoop is the same 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.400
 The ball I used to play 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:06.930
 son 

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:11.610
 the first thing we will measure the 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:15.780
 size that we will want to do to the 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:18.210
 cascade always starting 

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:23.550
 of greater than the average 

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:26.880
 this one will be my greater the 

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:28.770
 my biggest is this way then I go 

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.590
 cut about three of these 

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.600
 next size 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.090
 the other three I will decrease more or 

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:40.560
 least a couple fingers ok 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:42.030
 and so it goes there we will cut good I already 

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.010
 I left them cut but I go 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:44.549
 cut one for you to see as 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:48.380
 is 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:48.380
 I 'm going to measure with this 

00:01:55.340 --> 00:02:04.620
 with pliers they all have every amendment 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:12.229
 chain seam here with pliers I 

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:12.229
 I'm going to open the amendment to see 

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:27.510
 you give it a try so it comes out 

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:29.280
 it's very small even if you prefer 

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:32.070
 you can use that telecatch that 

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:35.520
 cuts're this text opens the amendment and 

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:37.410
 now I will close back this amendment if 

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:43.100
 you do not close at the time you put 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:43.100
 in the chain at the base will come out 

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:57.290
 this little ball 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:03:00.269
 I'll put on every tip 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:11.310
 all these tips and I'll put a 

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:11.909
 It 's easier, this ball is still here. 

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:18.769
 O 

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:18.769
 It's another line facing April 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:27.090
 see here a dog is from here I still 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:31.310
 I will not close because the same one that I go 

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:31.310
 use to put in the base is good 

00:03:32.739 --> 00:03:37.099
 I left them all cut in size 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.040
 certain 

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:43.640
 This one is the biggest one in between. 

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:45.079
 half to those six in the same size where 

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:48.170
 there are three each side 

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:50.239
 that is expected any size three 

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:52.340
 on each side and here another size in 

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:53.989
 three on each side is decreasing but will 

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:56.180
 decreasing little 

00:03:53.989 --> 00:03:58.989
 I'm just going to sort these out, man. 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:58.989
 mix 

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.170
 Let's start with these three 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:28.300
 First I'm going to get the current government. 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:29.770
 state closed her then to divide her into 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:37.180
 medium 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:42.630
 Starting from the middle, I gave it here. 

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:42.630
 take the ring is already open that 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:49.230
 fit here and put on the chain 

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:05.540
 now I'm going to close 

00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:31.390
 now doing with the others always 

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:33.690
 jumping a house a ring I made in that 

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:36.820
 next will not be this will be the other 

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:39.100
 always jumping a very mistaken time 

00:05:36.820 --> 00:05:42.450
 very one on top of the other 

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:42.450
 now I'll do 

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:16.650
 It's also cool, you want to do it 

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:19.560
 like to do it to a certain extent 

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:23.550
 in silver and down golden too 

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:26.370
 It was really cool or is this girls? 

00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:29.040
