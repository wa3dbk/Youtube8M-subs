I like to use a ladle to pour the batter
into<00:02:30.660> the<00:02:30.810> skillet<00:02:31.230> that<00:02:32.150> way<00:02:33.150> I<00:02:33.420> control<00:02:33.989> the

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:34.140 
into the skillet that way I control the

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:35.869 
into the skillet that way I control the
amount<00:02:34.349> that<00:02:34.739> I<00:02:34.769> put<00:02:35.040> about<00:02:35.220> a<00:02:35.250> quarter<00:02:35.670> cup<00:02:35.700> of

00:02:35.869 --> 00:02:35.879 
amount that I put about a quarter cup of

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:40.339 
amount that I put about a quarter cup of
batter<00:02:36.890> about<00:02:37.890> two<00:02:38.220> minutes<00:02:38.640> per<00:02:39.030> side<00:02:39.349> but

the<00:02:40.500> trick<00:02:40.769> to<00:02:40.980> know<00:02:41.129> that<00:02:41.340> the<00:02:41.430> pancakes<00:02:41.879> are

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:42.060 
the trick to know that the pancakes are

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:43.880 
the trick to know that the pancakes are
ready<00:02:42.209> to<00:02:42.390> be<00:02:42.510> flipped<00:02:42.750> is<00:02:43.079> when<00:02:43.379> they<00:02:43.530> create

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:43.890 
ready to be flipped is when they create

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:46.400 
ready to be flipped is when they create
little<00:02:44.160> bubbles<00:02:44.670> on<00:02:44.849> the<00:02:44.970> top<00:02:45.209> if<00:02:45.870> you<00:02:46.079> flip<00:02:46.380> it

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
little bubbles on the top if you flip it

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.199 
little bubbles on the top if you flip it
before<00:02:46.889> that<00:02:47.040> you're<00:02:47.280> gonna<00:02:47.370> have<00:02:47.549> a<00:02:47.579> huge

00:02:48.199 --> 00:02:48.209 
before that you're gonna have a huge

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:50.180 
before that you're gonna have a huge
mess<00:02:48.540> in<00:02:48.569> your<00:02:48.959> skillet<00:02:49.319> oh<00:02:49.500> the<00:02:49.829> batter<00:02:50.010> will
