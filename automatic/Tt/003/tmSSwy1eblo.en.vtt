have<00:02:22.680> to<00:02:22.799> only<00:02:22.920> use<00:02:23.250> three<00:02:23.849> of<00:02:23.970> these<00:02:24.090> holes<00:02:24.390> to

00:02:24.649 --> 00:02:24.659 
have to only use three of these holes to

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:28.250 
have to only use three of these holes to
hold<00:02:24.810> the<00:02:25.370> extruder<00:02:26.370> assembly<00:02:27.329> and<00:02:28.019> you<00:02:28.110> also

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
hold the extruder assembly and you also

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:30.680 
hold the extruder assembly and you also
notice<00:02:28.680> there<00:02:28.860> was<00:02:28.950> only<00:02:29.069> three<00:02:29.459> holes<00:02:29.700> over

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:30.690 
notice there was only three holes over

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.930 
notice there was only three holes over
here<00:02:31.049> since<00:02:31.890> the<00:02:32.099> rails<00:02:32.400> are<00:02:32.579> going<00:02:32.610> to<00:02:32.760> be<00:02:32.819> on

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
here since the rails are going to be on

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.690 
here since the rails are going to be on
this<00:02:33.209> side<00:02:33.480> we<00:02:34.110> have<00:02:34.140> counter<00:02:34.769> forwards<00:02:35.129> in

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:35.700 
this side we have counter forwards in

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.479 
this side we have counter forwards in
these<00:02:35.940> cool<00:02:36.239> locations<00:02:36.930> so<00:02:37.349> when<00:02:37.650> you<00:02:38.190> put<00:02:38.400> the

00:02:38.479 --> 00:02:38.489 
these cool locations so when you put the

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:40.880 
these cool locations so when you put the
screw<00:02:38.730> in<00:02:38.879> you'll<00:02:39.510> notice<00:02:39.720> it's<00:02:40.109> flashed<00:02:40.500> so

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:40.890 
screw in you'll notice it's flashed so

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.130 
screw in you'll notice it's flashed so
the<00:02:40.980> rail<00:02:41.159> will<00:02:41.340> be<00:02:41.489> able<00:02:41.640> to<00:02:41.879> be<00:02:42.540> placed<00:02:42.870> on

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
the rail will be able to be placed on

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.440 
the rail will be able to be placed on
top<00:02:43.349> of<00:02:43.500> that<00:02:43.650> without<00:02:44.159> a<00:02:44.189> problem<00:02:44.430> and<00:02:44.879> this

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:45.450 
top of that without a problem and this

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:46.520 
top of that without a problem and this
is<00:02:45.569> the<00:02:45.659> reason<00:02:45.810> why<00:02:45.989> we<00:02:46.109> need<00:02:46.230> to<00:02:46.319> put<00:02:46.440> the

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
is the reason why we need to put the

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.140 
is the reason why we need to put the
screws<00:02:46.769> in<00:02:46.799> first<00:02:47.190> because<00:02:47.400> the<00:02:47.730> rails<00:02:47.940> will

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:48.150 
screws in first because the rails will

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:49.490 
screws in first because the rails will
be<00:02:48.239> covering<00:02:48.599> the<00:02:48.690> holes<00:02:48.900> where<00:02:49.230> we<00:02:49.319> need<00:02:49.470> to

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:49.500 
be covering the holes where we need to

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.289 
be covering the holes where we need to
put<00:02:49.709> these<00:02:49.859> screws<00:02:50.010> it's<00:02:50.879> going<00:02:51.120> to<00:02:51.180> be
