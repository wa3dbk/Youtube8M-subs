side of the only reason why did that is

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.410 
side of the only reason why did that is
because<00:01:52.680> you<00:01:53.130> need<00:01:53.460> more<00:01:53.700> hair<00:01:53.939> if<00:01:54.090> you<00:01:54.210> part

your on the side you need more clips on

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.130 
your on the side you need more clips on
the<00:01:56.729> side<00:01:56.909> to<00:01:56.939> fill<00:01:57.299> that<00:01:57.329> in<00:01:57.479> or<00:01:57.780> else<00:01:57.930> it<00:01:58.110> just

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.140 
the side to fill that in or else it just

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.990 
the side to fill that in or else it just
doesn't<00:01:58.530> look<00:01:58.590> right<00:01:58.649> and<00:01:59.009> then<00:01:59.310> also<00:01:59.549> i<00:01:59.759> use
