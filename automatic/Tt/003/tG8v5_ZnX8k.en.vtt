all right now that you've had to suffer

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:13.940 
all right now that you've had to suffer
through<00:00:12.210> learning<00:00:12.690> all<00:00:12.840> about<00:00:12.870> gas<00:00:13.440> law<00:00:13.710> is<00:00:13.740> we

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950 
through learning all about gas law is we

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:15.980 
through learning all about gas law is we
get<00:00:14.070> to<00:00:14.130> have<00:00:14.309> a<00:00:14.340> little<00:00:14.639> bit<00:00:14.700> of<00:00:14.849> fun<00:00:15.030> what<00:00:15.960> I

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:15.990 
get to have a little bit of fun what I

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.170 
get to have a little bit of fun what I
have<00:00:16.230> here<00:00:16.740> is<00:00:16.949> known<00:00:17.220> as<00:00:17.369> a<00:00:17.400> potato<00:00:17.850> cannon

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:18.180 
have here is known as a potato cannon

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.290 
have here is known as a potato cannon
also<00:00:18.900> known<00:00:19.199> as<00:00:19.320> a<00:00:19.350> spud<00:00:19.800> gun<00:00:19.830> and<00:00:20.520> what<00:00:21.180> we're

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.300 
also known as a spud gun and what we're

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.730 
also known as a spud gun and what we're
going<00:00:21.420> to<00:00:21.480> do<00:00:21.660> is<00:00:21.869> we're<00:00:21.990> gonna<00:00:22.109> load<00:00:22.380> it<00:00:22.560> with

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:22.740 
going to do is we're gonna load it with

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.580 
going to do is we're gonna load it with
a<00:00:22.769> piece<00:00:22.980> of<00:00:23.010> potato<00:00:23.550> and<00:00:23.869> this<00:00:24.869> down<00:00:25.109> here<00:00:25.410> by

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
a piece of potato and this down here by

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.310 
a piece of potato and this down here by
the<00:00:25.650> way<00:00:25.769> it's<00:00:26.010> PVC<00:00:26.550> pipe<00:00:26.849> and<00:00:27.210> this<00:00:27.779> down<00:00:27.990> here

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:28.320 
the way it's PVC pipe and this down here

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.080 
the way it's PVC pipe and this down here
is<00:00:28.380> a<00:00:28.470> combustion<00:00:28.890> chamber<00:00:29.099> we're<00:00:29.970> gonna

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
is a combustion chamber we're gonna

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.060 
is a combustion chamber we're gonna
spray<00:00:30.449> a<00:00:30.689> combustible<00:00:31.170> fuel<00:00:31.560> in<00:00:31.769> here

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.070 
spray a combustible fuel in here

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.310 
spray a combustible fuel in here
something<00:00:32.550> like<00:00:32.850> hairspray<00:00:33.239> but<00:00:33.899> other

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:34.320 
something like hairspray but other

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:36.650 
something like hairspray but other
things<00:00:34.620> will<00:00:34.800> work<00:00:34.950> as<00:00:35.130> well<00:00:35.160> and<00:00:35.610> then<00:00:36.239> we're

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:36.660 
things will work as well and then we're

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.270 
things will work as well and then we're
going<00:00:36.809> to<00:00:36.960> cap<00:00:37.200> off<00:00:37.380> the<00:00:37.620> back<00:00:37.770> end<00:00:38.040> and<00:00:38.219> the

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:38.280 
going to cap off the back end and the

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.520 
going to cap off the back end and the
back<00:00:38.790> end<00:00:38.930> is<00:00:39.930> a<00:00:39.989> cap<00:00:40.350> that<00:00:41.250> has<00:00:41.430> a<00:00:41.460> little

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:42.530 
back end is a cap that has a little

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:45.619 
back end is a cap that has a little
Coleman<00:00:43.530> liner<00:00:43.739> igniter<00:00:44.160> on<00:00:44.430> it<00:00:44.579> and<00:00:44.820> so<00:00:45.390> when

00:00:45.619 --> 00:00:45.629 
Coleman liner igniter on it and so when

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:47.479 
Coleman liner igniter on it and so when
we<00:00:45.719> create<00:00:45.989> the<00:00:46.110> spark<00:00:46.440> it's<00:00:46.980> going<00:00:47.219> to<00:00:47.280> ignite

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489 
we create the spark it's going to ignite

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:50.200 
we create the spark it's going to ignite
the<00:00:47.700> fuel<00:00:47.730> the<00:00:48.600> fuel<00:00:48.870> is<00:00:49.020> going<00:00:49.289> to<00:00:49.440> expand

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:50.210 
the fuel the fuel is going to expand

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.819 
the fuel the fuel is going to expand
okay<00:00:51.210> and<00:00:51.480> the<00:00:51.719> reason<00:00:51.899> why<00:00:52.110> I<00:00:52.140> expands<00:00:52.620> is

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:52.829 
okay and the reason why I expands is

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:55.100 
okay and the reason why I expands is
both<00:00:53.039> because<00:00:53.219> of<00:00:53.430> Charles's<00:00:54.090> law<00:00:54.270> the<00:00:54.750> volume

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
both because of Charles's law the volume

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:56.450 
both because of Charles's law the volume
will<00:00:55.230> increase<00:00:55.260> because<00:00:55.920> the<00:00:55.949> temperature<00:00:56.430> is

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:56.460 
will increase because the temperature is

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:58.220 
will increase because the temperature is
going<00:00:56.640> up<00:00:56.850> because<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.149> fuel<00:00:57.510> is<00:00:57.539> combusting

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
going up because the fuel is combusting

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.670 
going up because the fuel is combusting
and<00:00:58.500> it<00:00:59.010> will<00:00:59.100> also<00:00:59.280> expand<00:01:00.149> because<00:01:00.780> of<00:01:01.199> lava

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
and it will also expand because of lava

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.920 
and it will also expand because of lava
god<00:01:01.859> rose<00:01:02.129> law<00:01:02.399> it<00:01:02.789> turns<00:01:03.030> out<00:01:03.270> that<00:01:03.539> you<00:01:03.750> have

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:03.930 
god rose law it turns out that you have

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.260 
god rose law it turns out that you have
greater<00:01:04.290> number<00:01:04.470> of<00:01:04.650> moles<00:01:05.070> in<00:01:05.670> the<00:01:05.700> in<00:01:06.150> the

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
greater number of moles in the in the

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:09.320 
greater number of moles in the in the
fuel<00:01:06.479> afterwards<00:01:07.549> more<00:01:08.549> moles<00:01:08.760> because<00:01:09.060> of

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
fuel afterwards more moles because of

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.820 
fuel afterwards more moles because of
carbon<00:01:09.780> down<00:01:09.960> of<00:01:10.140> formation<00:01:10.560> of<00:01:10.619> carbon

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:10.830 
carbon down of formation of carbon

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.149 
carbon down of formation of carbon
dioxide<00:01:10.920> and<00:01:11.460> water<00:01:12.080> from<00:01:13.080> the<00:01:13.200> field<00:01:13.890> that<00:01:14.040> we

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:14.159 
dioxide and water from the field that we

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.240 
dioxide and water from the field that we
start<00:01:14.490> okay<00:01:14.939> so<00:01:15.350> volume<00:01:16.350> increases<00:01:17.009> as<00:01:17.189> a

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
start okay so volume increases as a

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.920 
start okay so volume increases as a
result<00:01:17.400> of<00:01:17.700> both<00:01:17.850> Avogadro's<00:01:18.450> law<00:01:18.540> and

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:18.930 
result of both Avogadro's law and

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.590 
result of both Avogadro's law and
because<00:01:19.229> of<00:01:19.350> Charles's<00:01:19.799> law<00:01:19.979> and<00:01:20.520> that<00:01:21.119> volume

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:21.600 
because of Charles's law and that volume

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.780 
because of Charles's law and that volume
expansion<00:01:22.020> is<00:01:22.290> going<00:01:22.500> to<00:01:22.650> push<00:01:23.340> the<00:01:23.490> potato

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790 
expansion is going to push the potato

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.730 
expansion is going to push the potato
out<00:01:24.390> towards<00:01:24.780> the<00:01:24.900> open<00:01:25.110> field<00:01:25.350> here

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
out towards the open field here

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:32.330 
out towards the open field here
okay<00:01:26.400> so<00:01:26.460> let's<00:01:26.820> load<00:01:26.970> it<00:01:27.090> up<00:01:30.920> take<00:01:31.920> the<00:01:32.040> potato

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:32.340 
okay so let's load it up take the potato

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.880 
okay so let's load it up take the potato
the<00:01:33.329> end<00:01:33.479> of<00:01:33.630> the<00:01:33.720> tube<00:01:34.140> is<00:01:34.320> sharpened<00:01:34.829> a

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
the end of the tube is sharpened a

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:43.420 
the end of the tube is sharpened a
little<00:01:35.070> bit<00:01:35.220> so<00:01:35.430> we<00:01:35.549> can<00:01:35.759> easily<00:01:36.530> take<00:01:37.530> a<00:01:37.560> core

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:43.430 

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:47.630 

and<00:01:44.430> then<00:01:44.760> we<00:01:44.880> need<00:01:45.060> a<00:01:45.390> stick<00:01:46.350> the<00:01:47.280> jam<00:01:47.460> the

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
and then we need a stick the jam the

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.580 
and then we need a stick the jam the
potato<00:01:47.940> down<00:01:48.180> let's<00:01:48.780> see<00:01:48.900> how<00:01:48.930> far<00:01:49.200> we<00:01:49.380> want<00:01:49.470> to

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
potato down let's see how far we want to

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:59.789 
potato down let's see how far we want to
go<00:01:49.710> here

00:01:59.789 --> 00:01:59.799 

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:04.270 

and<00:02:00.799> then<00:02:01.240> you<00:02:02.240> spray<00:02:02.479> some<00:02:02.659> fuel<00:02:02.930> in<00:02:03.280> and

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 
and then you spray some fuel in and

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:13.300 
and then you spray some fuel in and
again<00:02:04.490> we're<00:02:04.640> gonna<00:02:04.700> use<00:02:04.909> hairspray<00:02:05.149> a<00:02:12.310> few

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:13.310 
again we're gonna use hairspray a few

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.290 
again we're gonna use hairspray a few
seconds<00:02:13.700> of<00:02:13.760> hairspray<00:02:14.380> and<00:02:15.380> then<00:02:15.620> we<00:02:15.830> will

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:16.300 
seconds of hairspray and then we will

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:23.800 
seconds of hairspray and then we will
assemble<00:02:17.300> the<00:02:17.450> cannon<00:02:22.330> and<00:02:23.330> then<00:02:23.450> we<00:02:23.630> will

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:23.810 
assemble the cannon and then we will

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:58.900 
assemble the cannon and then we will
turn<00:02:24.410> in<00:02:24.590> fire

00:02:58.900 --> 00:02:58.910 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:02.900 

cool<00:03:00.350> now<00:03:01.350> for<00:03:01.650> my<00:03:01.740> final<00:03:02.069> performance<00:03:02.310> take<00:03:02.880> a

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
cool now for my final performance take a

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.370 
cool now for my final performance take a
look<00:03:03.150> at<00:03:03.209> how<00:03:03.360> a<00:03:03.390> chemist<00:03:03.900> makes<00:03:04.110> mashed

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:04.380 
look at how a chemist makes mashed

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.860 
look at how a chemist makes mashed
potatoes
