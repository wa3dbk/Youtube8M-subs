00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.350
 all mice hi girls today 

00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.509
 the theme will be very much trembling 

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.790
 because very often they ask me a question 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.920
 about how I struggle with ingrown hairs and 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.049
 in general if I have them and what they have 

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.059
 I do think almost every 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:17.880
 girls at least once in life was that 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:20.250
 she had some kind of hair brooches and 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.350
 it looks very ugly either 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:25.109
 there is a bump and then even some 

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:26.699
 suppurations sometimes remain after this 

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:28.529
 spots on the skin that is it is very 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.990
 ugly and need of course for this 

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:33.239
 follow so let's break it all down 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.219
 steps you need to do for 

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.739
 to prevent this from appearing if 

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.809
 then how to deal with it more often 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:43.140
 total hair grows due to the fact that we 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:45.989
 make an appeal not courting while we 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:49.230
 Additionally, I do not disinfect the skin and 

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:51.539
 and do not moisturize after hair removal also 

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.489
 not using special tools for 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.320
 shave and so on and so forth then 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:57.329
 there are not doing all sorts of different 

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.430
 points which in principle we should 

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.289
 still do the least of course 

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:03.390
 hair grows when we go to the salon 

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:06.570
 but to many it may not seem 

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:08.189
 Pocket because everyone probably 3-4 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.170
 weeks you still have to walk 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:13.080
 salon to remove hair 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.369
 and doing at home hair removal 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.830
 for example wax 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:20.220
 most often the very first and most important 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:22.380
 a mistake in growing hair is something 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.540
 that we simply do not choose correctly 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.810
 voice and you need to choose against growth 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.610
 hair and keep your hand parallel to the skin 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.700
 if here we smeared wax then we 

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:33.900
 choose here so here is up 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.210
 action that is parallel to the arm 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.310
 entered the skin and against hair growth 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.340
 if we do hair removal is not about our 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:44.250
 hair breaks off the bulb remains 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:45.720
 whole and our hair away broke up inside 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.310
 he just grows like him 

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:50.310
 please because he just 

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:52.350
 don't see the way out so let's say outside therefore 

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.710
 he begins to grow under his skin 

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:57.990
 somehow there like she wants to start she show 

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:00.719
 those tools that I use on 

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.670
 now for hair removal 1 100 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:05.250
 used for depilation I have it 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.680
 wax from HIV most often I buy for 

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.270
 sensitive skin is also of course in 

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:13.110
 I have an epilator 

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:15.090
 this epilator rowenta fresh extreme elf 

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:17.400
 narrow taxes and downstairs I will leave a number 

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:20.910
 if someone is interested and I love him 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:23.520
 always with me and more recently 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:26.640
 again returned to the razor breed but it 

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:28.470
 me chic here is such an ordinary replaceable 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.750
 head then there is no gel 

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.910
 because during tried different 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.250
 I realized that, in principle, this gel is very 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.620
 quickly washed off and easier to take all the same 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:39.690
 such here are the usual and so now I am 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:42.030
 I'll tell you step by step how to make home 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:43.620
 conditions of epilation to as little as possible 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.210
 you had ingrown hair 

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.250
 and maybe you will not be 

00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:49.260
 skin needs to be processed ahead 

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:52.260
 antiseptic absolutely any 

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:54.450
 miramistinom chlorhexidine even 

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.760
 furatsilinom that is process skin 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.420
 that there is no dirt and that 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.910
 God forbid 

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.860
 and then nothing you got into these 

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:04.110
 framework which is formed after 

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:06.360
 you remove your hair second main 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:08.190
 The point is that if you remove hair with 

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.210
 using a razor then you do it by 

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.010
 hair growth 

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:12.450
 and if different epilator my and 

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:15.930
 depilator amita you this is a must 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:18.120
 do against hair growth and preferably 

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:21.180
 parallel to your core then we again 

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:23.190
 we treat the skin with antiseptic and in 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.440
 the end we must necessarily bear 

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:27.750
 some kind of emollient for example 

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:30.980
 I have a cream like this now 

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:33.840
 fat from organic shop 10 5 oils 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:35.430
 lychee extract with aroma gives on 

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:37.440
 soothe your skin so that it is not 

00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:40.080
 so annoyed she calms down faster 

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:43.170
 and also recommend you between treatments 

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:45.930
 hair removal must use 

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:47.850
 agents that slow down hair growth 

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:51.300
 believe they are really very strong 

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:52.800
 help to make hair much 

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:54.270
 less overgrown i mean i can't 

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.950
 say that they are strong like this 

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:58.110
 slow down hair growth but they 

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:58.950
 really help to not hair 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:01.170
 overgrown 

00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:03.510
 not the most important ways of my 

00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:05.090
 dealing with ingrown hair is this 

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:08.310
 be sure to scrub and 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:10.110
 use of washcloths about 

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:12.090
 with the edge and I want to say that you should not 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:15.290
 too often scrub the skin because 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:17.780
 that together where recently done hair removal 

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:20.509
 epilation skin rather irritated not 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:22.490
 once again annoy her I think 2 

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:25.370
 once a week is enough for that 

00:04:22.490 --> 00:04:27.289
 to use a scrub and but most often 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:30.050
 I still use this one 

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:32.509
 glove that puts on the hand up 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:33.320
 middle I think I had the time to buy in 

00:04:32.509 --> 00:04:35.660
 bar shop 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:37.220
 if i'm not mistaken she is enough 

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:39.770
 tough but at the same time extreme 

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:42.139
 soft and when i go already in the shower then 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:44.300
 surely I am talking about where to go 

00:04:42.139 --> 00:04:48.169
 bill cling especially zone 

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:51.139
 I don't scrub bikini areas 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:53.090
 but just true this skin to give 

00:04:51.139 --> 00:04:55.160
 hairs that are just there 

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:57.020
 begin to grow or give birth to give 

00:04:55.160 --> 00:05:00.259
 hairs grow in the right direction 

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:02.210
 it softens the skin removes hardened 

00:05:00.259 --> 00:05:04.220
 some word and really hair 

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:05.930
 practically do not grow 

00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:08.090
 This is a super glove, I advise everyone 

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:10.789
 buy it probably even better than 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:12.470
 bast because it has such straight 

00:05:10.789 --> 00:05:13.479
 fairly dense direct 

00:05:12.470 --> 00:05:15.680
 skin contact 

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:18.259
 if it so happened that all the same 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:20.570
 ingrown hair formed before 

00:05:18.259 --> 00:05:22.659
 just to get it I 

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:25.070
 I advise you I do not advise you I ask you 

00:05:22.659 --> 00:05:27.169
 be sure to sanitize soon 

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:29.810
 so god forbid don't get any dirt 

00:05:27.169 --> 00:05:31.669
 what are the microbes in this frame that you 

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:34.190
 then formed necessarily 

00:05:31.669 --> 00:05:36.409
 process the skin and then I 

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:38.690
 for example, use either tweezers or 

00:05:36.409 --> 00:05:40.659
 needle with a needle much somehow 

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:43.550
 harder it seems to me but again 

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:45.940
 Be sure to prezenter leave and tweezers and 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:49.070
 needle and gently reach out 

00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:50.900
 hair as gently as possible to 

00:05:49.070 --> 00:05:51.949
 least of all damage your skin and 

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:54.169
 sure then also 

00:05:51.949 --> 00:05:56.990
 disinfect the skin so as not to fall 

00:05:54.169 --> 00:05:59.740
 no germs and always smear 

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:02.090
 cream softening and moisturizing and 

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:04.430
 soothing another way about which 

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:06.289
 I heard it with aspirin, but 

00:06:04.430 --> 00:06:08.870
 honestly on myself i didn't try it 

00:06:06.289 --> 00:06:10.310
 so I can’t say not to give 

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:12.080
 you are not any reviews 

00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:15.650
 you just need to take an aspirin pill 

00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:18.289
 dilute and a little water and apply here 

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:20.419
 This is the mass of effervescent on the skin will be 

00:06:18.289 --> 00:06:22.820
 a little bit i want to notice that hair 

00:06:20.419 --> 00:06:25.520
 not all grow it most often 

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:29.900
 depends on the quality of your skin if u 

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:33.050
 your hair grows fast enough 

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:35.599
 so tough you have tight skin and 

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:38.300
 Of course, the problem with past hairs 

00:06:35.599 --> 00:06:40.729
 all the same will be if not then most likely 

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:42.529
 No, because I know which girls 

00:06:40.729 --> 00:06:45.169
 never in life ever in life 

00:06:42.529 --> 00:06:47.240
 there was no ingrown hair also know those who 

00:06:45.169 --> 00:06:49.909
 constantly with these pains from struggling with it 

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:53.810
 I want to summarize today's video 

00:06:49.909 --> 00:06:56.150
 and negotiate the most important points to combat 

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:58.279
 ingrown hairs and so the first thing we 

00:06:56.150 --> 00:07:01.990
 should do it right 

00:06:58.279 --> 00:07:04.690
 epilation depilation and shaving second 

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:08.000
 be sure to process the skin with 

00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:10.490
 emollient sedatives as well 

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:13.190
 with creams that slow down growth 

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:15.889
 hair is a great help for 

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:18.710
 struggle with ingrown hairs third paragraph 

00:07:15.889 --> 00:07:20.659
 it is imperative to use the bast glasses 

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:22.610
 as I showed you as well as scrub 

00:07:20.659 --> 00:07:25.279
 which is also very very good 

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:28.539
 urgent hairs and 4 if all the same 

00:07:25.279 --> 00:07:30.909
 this has already happened 

00:07:28.539 --> 00:07:34.010
 disinfect neatly use 

00:07:30.909 --> 00:07:35.599
 pintzhetikom needle or aspirin is 

00:07:34.010 --> 00:07:37.550
 all the information that I am with you today 

00:07:35.599 --> 00:07:39.889
 I wanted to share, I hope it is for you 

00:07:37.550 --> 00:07:41.719
 it was useful and you for yourself after all 

00:07:39.889 --> 00:07:43.820
 something interesting underlined if u 

00:07:41.719 --> 00:07:46.010
 you have some interesting methods 

00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:47.870
 be sure to write me in the comments 

00:07:46.010 --> 00:07:50.599
 It will be interesting to know how you struggle with 

00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:52.639
 ingrown hairs but for today it's all 

00:07:50.599 --> 00:07:56.409
 I say goodbye to you all very much 

00:07:52.639 --> 00:07:56.409
