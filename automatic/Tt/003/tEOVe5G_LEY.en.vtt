00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:15.130 
but giving us some introspective and

but giving us some introspective and
insightful<00:02:15.580> bears<00:02:16.000> so<00:02:16.600> I<00:02:16.630> don't<00:02:16.840> know<00:02:16.960> why<00:02:17.140> he

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.320 
insightful bears so I don't know why he

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:19.830 
insightful bears so I don't know why he
continues<00:02:17.830> to<00:02:17.860> use<00:02:18.280> autotune<00:02:18.970> I<00:02:19.390> think<00:02:19.720> it's

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:19.840 
continues to use autotune I think it's

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.540 
continues to use autotune I think it's
alright<00:02:20.170> sometimes<00:02:20.710> and<00:02:20.980> it<00:02:21.070> does<00:02:21.280> fit<00:02:21.520> the

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
alright sometimes and it does fit the

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.430 
alright sometimes and it does fit the
feel<00:02:21.880> of<00:02:21.910> certain<00:02:22.450> tracks<00:02:22.750> but<00:02:23.200> when<00:02:23.320> you're

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:23.440 
feel of certain tracks but when you're

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:24.870 
feel of certain tracks but when you're
getting<00:02:23.560> honest<00:02:24.220> and<00:02:24.400> spitting<00:02:24.670> some

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:24.880 
getting honest and spitting some

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.970

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:26.980 
heartfelt shit like this I feel like the

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.040 
heartfelt shit like this I feel like the
auto-tune<00:02:27.280> just<00:02:27.730> sucks<00:02:28.120> all<00:02:28.270> the<00:02:28.450> emotion<00:02:28.930> out

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:29.050 
auto-tune just sucks all the emotion out

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:31.290 
auto-tune just sucks all the emotion out
of<00:02:29.320> what<00:02:29.620> you're<00:02:29.740> saying<00:02:30.040> some<00:02:30.640> raw<00:02:30.820> vocals

00:02:31.290 --> 00:02:31.300 
of what you're saying some raw vocals

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:32.880 
of what you're saying some raw vocals
would<00:02:31.480> have<00:02:31.570> worked<00:02:31.720> better<00:02:32.020> because<00:02:32.470> then<00:02:32.800> we

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:32.890 
would have worked better because then we

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:34.860 
would have worked better because then we
can<00:02:33.040> hear<00:02:33.250> your<00:02:33.430> emotion<00:02:33.910> and<00:02:34.000> really<00:02:34.630> feel

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:34.870 
can hear your emotion and really feel

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:36.420 
can hear your emotion and really feel
what<00:02:35.080> you're<00:02:35.200> saying<00:02:35.440> but<00:02:35.890> that's<00:02:36.070> just<00:02:36.190> my

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
what you're saying but that's just my

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.970 
what you're saying but that's just my
opinion<00:02:36.550> so<00:02:37.480> those<00:02:37.660> first<00:02:38.020> four<00:02:38.350> tracks<00:02:38.740> are

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:38.980 
opinion so those first four tracks are

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:41.040 
opinion so those first four tracks are
for<00:02:39.430> the<00:02:39.640> better<00:02:39.820> tracks<00:02:40.209> on<00:02:40.420> the<00:02:40.540> album<00:02:40.660> and

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:41.050 
for the better tracks on the album and

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:42.780 
for the better tracks on the album and
another<00:02:41.530> one<00:02:41.740> of<00:02:41.830> the<00:02:41.920> songs<00:02:42.160> that<00:02:42.310> I<00:02:42.430> really

his<00:03:03.310> flows<00:03:03.640> are<00:03:03.850> pretty<00:03:04.090> basic<00:03:04.330> and<00:03:04.690> there<00:03:04.930> is

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:05.020

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:06.750 
his flows are pretty basic and there is
nothing<00:03:05.320> about<00:03:05.530> his<00:03:05.680> lyricism<00:03:05.980> or<00:03:06.400> delivery

that<00:03:07.180> stuck<00:03:07.450> out<00:03:07.630> to<00:03:07.660> me<00:03:07.840> but<00:03:08.530> another<00:03:08.800> lyrical

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:09.310 
that stuck out to me but another lyrical

00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:11.550 
that stuck out to me but another lyrical
standout<00:03:09.700> on<00:03:09.850> here<00:03:10.120> is<00:03:10.360> the<00:03:10.570> song<00:03:10.810> pulling<00:03:11.410> up

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:11.560 
standout on here is the song pulling up

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.770 
standout on here is the song pulling up
where<00:03:12.040> Wayne<00:03:12.310> and<00:03:12.580> gyro<00:03:12.790> go<00:03:13.060> back<00:03:13.300> and<00:03:13.540> forth

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:13.780 
where Wayne and gyro go back and forth

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.750 
where Wayne and gyro go back and forth
with<00:03:13.989> some<00:03:14.170> really<00:03:14.470> rapid<00:03:15.130> fast<00:03:15.459> fire

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:15.760 
with some really rapid fast fire

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.670 
with some really rapid fast fire
aggressive<00:03:16.450> flows<00:03:16.750> so<00:03:17.170> that<00:03:17.290> was<00:03:17.440> a<00:03:17.470> good

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:17.680 
aggressive flows so that was a good

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:20.250 
aggressive flows so that was a good
track<00:03:17.950> too<00:03:18.250> other<00:03:18.970> than<00:03:19.180> that<00:03:19.239> though<00:03:19.630> Wayne

00:03:23.490 --> 00:03:23.500 
just absolutely frustrates me on this

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.650 
just absolutely frustrates me on this

from Ghostbusters reference so that has

00:05:36.950 --> 00:05:38.920 
from Ghostbusters reference so that has
to<00:05:37.070> count<00:05:37.220> for<00:05:37.430> something<00:05:37.880> and<00:05:38.060> he<00:05:38.360> also<00:05:38.510> raps

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:38.930 
to count for something and he also raps

00:05:38.930 --> 00:05:40.840 
to count for something and he also raps
about<00:05:39.230> that<00:05:39.440> infamous<00:05:39.830> incident<00:05:40.460> where<00:05:40.820> he

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:40.850 
about that infamous incident where he

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:42.880 
about that infamous incident where he
shot<00:05:41.150> himself<00:05:41.360> in<00:05:41.630> the<00:05:41.750> chest<00:05:41.960> back<00:05:42.560> when<00:05:42.770> he

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:42.890 
shot himself in the chest back when he

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:45.250 
shot himself in the chest back when he
was<00:05:43.010> a<00:05:43.070> young<00:05:43.280> man<00:05:43.520> but<00:05:44.360> in<00:05:44.510> the<00:05:44.630> end<00:05:44.810> I<00:05:45.050> think

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:45.260 
was a young man but in the end I think

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:46.900 
was a young man but in the end I think
that<00:05:45.650> this<00:05:45.770> is<00:05:45.950> one<00:05:46.100> of<00:05:46.220> Wayne's<00:05:46.430> best

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:46.910 
that this is one of Wayne's best

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:49.930 
that this is one of Wayne's best
projects<00:05:47.570> in<00:05:47.690> years<00:05:48.350> so<00:05:48.800> I<00:05:48.830> have<00:05:49.130> it<00:05:49.250> at<00:05:49.430> a<00:05:49.490> 3

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:49.940 
projects in years so I have it at a 3

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:53.470 
projects in years so I have it at a 3
out<00:05:50.180> of<00:05:50.240> 5<00:05:50.870> I<00:05:51.350> was<00:05:51.860> gonna<00:05:52.070> go<00:05:52.310> with<00:05:52.460> a<00:05:52.520> 3.5<00:05:53.300> out

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:53.480 
out of 5 I was gonna go with a 3.5 out

00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:55.660 
out of 5 I was gonna go with a 3.5 out
of<00:05:53.510> 5<00:05:53.600> for<00:05:53.870> this<00:05:54.050> one<00:05:54.230> it<00:05:54.470> was<00:05:54.650> really<00:05:54.680> close

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:55.670 
of 5 for this one it was really close

00:05:55.670 --> 00:05:57.220 
of 5 for this one it was really close
but<00:05:56.210> I<00:05:56.270> think<00:05:56.360> if<00:05:56.660> he<00:05:56.750> could<00:05:56.960> have<00:05:57.050> cut<00:05:57.200> the

00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:57.230 
but I think if he could have cut the

00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:00.970 
but I think if he could have cut the
auto-tune<00:05:57.680> usage<00:05:58.220> down<00:05:58.490> by<00:05:58.850> even<00:05:59.180> 50%<00:06:00.140> this

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:00.980 
auto-tune usage down by even 50% this

00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:03.400 
auto-tune usage down by even 50% this
would<00:06:01.190> have<00:06:01.340> been<00:06:01.490> so<00:06:01.940> much<00:06:02.300> better<00:06:02.870> because

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:03.410 
would have been so much better because

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:04.870 
would have been so much better because
when<00:06:03.560> he<00:06:03.680> straight-up<00:06:04.010> spits<00:06:04.460> and<00:06:04.670> isn't

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:04.880 
when he straight-up spits and isn't

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:07.240 
when he straight-up spits and isn't
doing<00:06:04.910> that<00:06:05.120> mumbly<00:06:05.660> croaky<00:06:06.140> shit<00:06:06.410> he<00:06:06.830> sounds

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:07.250 
doing that mumbly croaky shit he sounds

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:09.940 
doing that mumbly croaky shit he sounds
great<00:06:07.310> it's<00:06:08.240> just<00:06:08.360> that<00:06:08.690> the<00:06:08.840> auto-tune<00:06:09.170> sucks

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:09.950 
great it's just that the auto-tune sucks

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:11.950 
great it's just that the auto-tune sucks
the<00:06:10.130> life<00:06:10.310> out<00:06:10.550> of<00:06:10.580> some<00:06:10.820> of<00:06:10.940> these<00:06:11.030> songs<00:06:11.270> take

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:11.960 
the life out of some of these songs take

for example the heartbreak anthem

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:16.450 
for example the heartbreak anthem
without<00:06:14.330> you<00:06:14.690> it<00:06:15.260> has<00:06:15.530> some<00:06:15.770> great<00:06:15.980> female
