00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.629
 I will show you how to get out now 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:05.839
 a sheet of paper that a din a4 

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:07.160
 sheet of paper as a butterfly builds 

00:00:05.839 --> 00:00:11.219
 or 

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:13.259
 astrid and that you need for just one 

00:00:11.219 --> 00:00:14.120
 short a heavy and the A4 sheet 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:17.039
 paper 

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:20.970
 then you take this page of the paper 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:26.130
 edge and happiness to these that the 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:29.220
 edges are together so you can 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:33.149
 then try as closely as possible 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:35.730
 to be if you could have done that 

00:00:33.149 --> 00:00:37.469
 her the piece protruding below with the 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.450
 cut off scissors then you have one 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:40.170
 square I've been after what 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.550
 prepared 

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:45.899
 then it looks like you 're taking it now 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:51.030
 this corner and she can push the 

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:54.780
 the other corner should know all 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:58.739
 next to each other are just that 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.859
 waters after that you have so much in 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:03.809
 your paper 

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:07.619
 Now you do the paper like this 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:10.250
 hit a horizontal line in the 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:10.250
 excel 1 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:23.850
 then you look like you threw 

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:25.009
 Next you have to fold the paper 

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:29.189
 lift up here 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:32.520
 so this corner to know who knew 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:37.979
 then press it in like that 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:42.170
 also with the hand with the other 

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:42.170
 Just delete this page 

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:51.090
 then you have such a triangle as 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:53.970
 next you take this corner and pushes 

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:55.740
 you at this corner but at the same time 

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.890
 should the edges just close together 

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:00.119
 lie 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:09.479
 that's exactly what the other one does 

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:11.519
 side the expensive paper as 

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:15.630
 next turn you turn the sheet 

00:02:11.519 --> 00:02:19.260
 paper and takes the lower part and 

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:22.170
 wear it to the top but so 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.359
 that's about the width of the thumb 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:27.120
 is still free so that's about 

00:02:24.359 --> 00:02:36.989
 like so especially on the table 

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:40.410
 makes everything work folds it looks like that 

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:44.609
 Next, the sheet turns again 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:46.519
 paper take these wings here and 

00:02:44.609 --> 00:02:51.060
 then pulls down 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:54.120
 Here then arises such an obstacle so 

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.290
 if you see that you already leave that 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:03:01.260
 that does not mean you 're pulling that then 

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:05.780
 he just pushes it that way it 's smooth 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:09.600
 and then that's the other side as well 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:13.950
 just fold back and see it that way 

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:18.269
 out turns the eda 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:19.769
 the whole takes the head now and 

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:22.170
 pushed him down as far as possible 

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:29.549
 So that's just that in the 

00:03:22.170 --> 00:03:31.200
 qantas he takes a small piece and 

00:03:29.549 --> 00:03:38.280
 push it back up again so 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:41.340
 something like that so there's a little something up there 

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:43.670
 so she lets out and so on 

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:47.939
 this side 

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:49.620
 next you should do that in the 

00:03:47.939 --> 00:03:53.180
 middle of the butterfly in the middle 

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:53.180
 fold like that 

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:10.790
 now you have to crockery is one 

00:04:07.159 --> 00:04:13.579
 Invisible line can recognize this 

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:15.379
 then you can tell by the wings here 

00:04:13.579 --> 00:04:17.709
 so nothing falls drawing the times 

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:17.709
 a short 

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:33.020
 should therefore about the basis of the lines 

00:04:27.259 --> 00:04:38.120
 you then fold that in others 

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:43.669
 pages are exactly the same page and page 

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:48.110
 you put that together and the next 

00:04:43.669 --> 00:04:51.860
 you have to get the wings back to the 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:54.620
 Press body and try the wing 

00:04:51.860 --> 00:04:58.120
 so press down that there is a 

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:58.120
 line with the body is so 

00:05:05.699 --> 00:05:15.580
 There is a song in the body and if 

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:20.770
 you are clever in doing it 

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:21.940
 then a butterfly out that you 

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:23.009
 that's exactly what he does and all the more 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:26.080
 made more cautious 

00:05:23.009 --> 00:05:28.000
 A good butterfly comes out 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:31.139
 and knows how to use colors then 

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.139
 see the whole also bund
