00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:36.270
 because they are friends in this class today 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:39.490
 let's see a bit of what are the 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:42.740
 heavy metal rhythms 

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:47.380
 well I will explain a little 

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:47.380
 what it characterizes rhythmical 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:56.059
 metal music is that a 

00:00:52.640 --> 00:01:01.270
 technique called running in progress that 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:01:01.270
 it's just something good 

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:12.050
 what we do here is 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:18.280
 we use a light that is for 

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:18.280
 press and press supports us 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:26.100
 of the right hand 

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:28.590
 on the exact point of departure of the 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:31.200
 bridge of the guitar of the strings 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:35.000
 where from the point where the 

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.000
 ropes are free 

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:40.820
 this does not require pressure but that 

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:44.600
 it requires that one with total confidence 

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:46.640
 support your hand in that you have and place 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.870
 this is going to do is to turn off the 

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:53.390
 harmonics of the strings 

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:53.390
 then the guitar and national robert 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:03.570
 I'm not making a match but 

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.570
 work 

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:11.380
 there is a big difference let's say because 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.870
 we are turning off all the harmonics 

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:16.770
 then they understand perfectly what 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.770
 that I do the pick 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:30.320
 that is very clear 

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:30.320
 and every movement with the plectrum 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.560
 how to do it first 

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:38.180
 we need that we have a good 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:40.160
 right hand position and good 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:43.370
 position from 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:44.600
 starting from which we are to act now 

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.880
 everyone I tell my students 

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:50.300
 I also tell them 

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:52.460
 the most efficient way to use the 

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:55.990
 grape is to make the beginning of a cross 

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:55.990
 leaving aside 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:03.560
 we take in shape 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:05.959
 radical in this case the thumb and the 

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:09.490
 barb in the horizontal direction 

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:11.650
 to stay this way 

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:13.710
 the index finger of the company then 

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:17.340
 we have to ocular 

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:20.070
 perdigal and horizontal index finger and Cuba 

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:22.930
 should be protruding the tip of the 

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:27.969
 Cuba on the side that's the most important thing 

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:29.140
 good then when it comes to going on a 

00:03:27.969 --> 00:03:31.629
 little bit of controversy 

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:33.219
 at the time of going over the rope I 

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:35.079
 What I recommend is that there is a bit of 

00:03:33.219 --> 00:03:36.849
 angle but make a move 

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:40.030
 down straight 

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:42.549
 another a little angle but straight 

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:45.440
 this way we do not hook too much 

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:48.530
 strings but we give 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:51.350
 a little less resistance used 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:55.910
 through the network where he acts so that he does not 

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:57.860
 interpret the movement ok already going 

00:03:55.910 --> 00:04:01.040
 directly to what are the bases 

00:03:57.860 --> 00:04:03.690
 rhythmic is very common brief in the metal 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:06.630
 bases remove 

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:08.870
 where a note is used 

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:10.490
 predominant 

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:13.620
 what 

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:17.959
 for example the sixth string for example 

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:22.250
 and will be worth arranging the chords 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:22.250
 let's say they are incorporating some chords 

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:26.500
 at par 

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:28.660
 it depends on the rhythmic 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.980
 has to do with the present subject greater 

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:33.120
 we have played but good because a 

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:33.120
 rhythmic for example could be 

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:41.270
 but what I'm doing is pulling 

00:04:38.250 --> 00:04:42.830
 this rope 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:45.620
 in this case by tuning the 

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:48.800
 guitar this string is in network 

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:53.949
 pulling re 

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:53.949
 and me here basically 

00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:02.889
 what is the technique of palm that is 

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:05.229
 use here 

00:05:02.889 --> 00:05:08.639
 it only applies to the sixth in this 

00:05:05.229 --> 00:05:08.639
 case in this case this rhythmic 

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:15.050
 because when when we apply 

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:18.879
 the 

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:18.879
 the chord is loose 

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:23.250
 this is very important when we 

00:05:20.699 --> 00:05:26.250
 we introduce chords always the chords 

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:30.180
 they should be loose people unless they are 

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:32.789
 chords of passage that is very fast but 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:35.940
 other than in the fall of the 

00:05:32.789 --> 00:05:40.610
 cut we 're always going to drop 

00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:40.610
 in the next in the next video 

00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:47.340
 what is the correct use of the 

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:50.160
 right hand in this case to be able 

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:52.740
 to be effective at the time of 

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:54.870
 make the accumulated the closed notes 

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:57.150
 what we're going to see and the notes that go 

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:59.130
 open the notes that go with it with 

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:01.680
 the open chord concerts with all 

00:05:59.130 --> 00:06:03.330
 the harmonics the best the most 

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:07.650
 correct the minors I'm just going to 

00:06:03.330 --> 00:06:09.780
 be saying in the video that follows 

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:12.150
 the soon I ask all that 

00:06:09.780 --> 00:06:14.460
 program is to be be aware of 

00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:17.870
 new physics and what goes up that is 

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:17.870
 subscribe to my channel 

00:06:18.009 --> 00:06:24.639
 and good also review there is enough 

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:27.189
 material so much musical material that I 

00:06:24.639 --> 00:06:29.889
 I have in my channel the discs that I 

00:06:27.189 --> 00:06:31.629
 I have available for download or not 

00:06:29.889 --> 00:06:33.819
 can listen on youtube or be able to go 

00:06:31.629 --> 00:06:35.949

00:06:42.129 --> 00:06:48.129
 details of the video is a link to 

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:53.249
