I would look it up but I already know
what<00:01:58.890> it<00:01:59.070> is<00:01:59.219> I'm<00:01:59.490> just<00:01:59.700> going<00:01:59.790> to<00:02:00.030> end<00:02:00.240> the

00:02:00.469 --> 00:02:00.479 
what it is I'm just going to end the

00:02:00.479 --> 00:02:01.880 
what it is I'm just going to end the
process<00:02:00.719> again

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
process again

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.260 
process again
so<00:02:02.890> you<00:02:02.979> go<00:02:03.100> or<00:02:03.340> not<00:02:03.490> get<00:02:03.850> rid<00:02:03.969> of<00:02:04.030> anything

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:04.270 
so you go or not get rid of anything

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.679 
so you go or not get rid of anything
like<00:02:04.979> csrs<00:02:05.979> s<00:02:06.219> all<00:02:06.429> about<00:02:06.460> run<00:02:06.909> rule<00:02:07.149> okay<00:02:07.479> as

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:07.689 
like csrs s all about run rule okay as

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:09.690 
like csrs s all about run rule okay as
this<00:02:08.289> was<00:02:08.470> locked<00:02:08.709> down<00:02:08.830> after<00:02:09.190> you<00:02:09.519> do<00:02:09.670> that

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:09.700 
this was locked down after you do that

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:11.610 
this was locked down after you do that
you<00:02:09.879> will<00:02:10.030> notice<00:02:10.300> that<00:02:10.390> your<00:02:10.660> are<00:02:10.899> Grammys

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620 
you will notice that your are Grammys

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.210 
you will notice that your are Grammys
increase<00:02:12.190> and<00:02:12.580> that<00:02:12.750> it's<00:02:13.750> using<00:02:14.170> less<00:02:14.860> ram

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:15.220 
increase and that it's using less ram

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:16.800 
increase and that it's using less ram
through<00:02:15.610> on<00:02:15.670> your<00:02:15.700> computer<00:02:16.360> so<00:02:16.629> your

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:19.030 
computer will go a significantly

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:24.509 
computer will go a significantly
figuring<00:02:19.870> out<00:02:20.049> faster<00:02:20.769> ok<00:02:21.459> guys<00:02:21.670> see<00:02:22.450> oh<00:02:23.519> I

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:29.260 
down here just look at UCP you see

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:31.289 
down here just look at UCP you see
general<00:02:29.620> and<00:02:29.860> keep<00:02:30.459> keepin<00:02:30.940> on<00:02:31.060> your

general and keep keepin on your

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:33.210 
general and keep keepin on your
processes<00:02:31.870> see<00:02:32.110> how<00:02:32.319> they<00:02:32.470> don't<00:02:32.739> get<00:02:32.950> out<00:02:33.129> of

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:33.220 
processes see how they don't get out of

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:35.759 
processes see how they don't get out of
hand<00:02:33.430> see<00:02:34.180> here<00:02:34.450> my<00:02:34.660> memory<00:02:35.110> it's<00:02:35.319> going<00:02:35.620> up

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:35.769 
hand see here my memory it's going up

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:37.920 
hand see here my memory it's going up
okay<00:02:36.370> for<00:02:36.730> the<00:02:36.819> amount<00:02:37.000> of<00:02:37.150> RAM<00:02:37.360> that<00:02:37.540> I<00:02:37.599> have

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:37.930 
okay for the amount of RAM that I have

00:02:37.930 --> 00:02:41.220 
okay for the amount of RAM that I have
but<00:02:38.620> I<00:02:38.799> could<00:02:39.130> all<00:02:39.310> still<00:02:39.910> be<00:02:39.970> using<00:02:40.510> less<00:02:40.750> if<00:02:41.079> I

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
but I could all still be using less if I

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:44.910 
but I could all still be using less if I
wanted<00:02:41.560> to<00:02:41.640> so<00:02:42.640> I'm<00:02:43.120> gonna<00:02:43.680> improve<00:02:44.680> my
