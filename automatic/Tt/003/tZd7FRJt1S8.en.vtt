00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:35.550 
and it was adorable she's so pretty
I'm<00:04:33.190> sure<00:04:33.520> she'll<00:04:34.000> get<00:04:34.150> like<00:04:34.510> I<00:04:34.840> mean<00:04:35.230> if<00:04:35.410> we

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:35.560 
I'm sure she'll get like I mean if we

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:37.890 
I'm sure she'll get like I mean if we
get<00:04:35.740> infinity<00:04:36.580> and<00:04:36.760> so<00:04:36.880> on<00:04:37.060> she'll<00:04:37.360> get<00:04:37.480> like<00:04:37.690> a

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:37.900 
get infinity and so on she'll get like a

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:39.540 
get infinity and so on she'll get like a
transformation<00:04:38.530> sequence<00:04:38.830> that<00:04:38.950> isn't<00:04:39.310> I

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:39.550 
transformation sequence that isn't I

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:41.010 
transformation sequence that isn't I
don't<00:04:39.910> know<00:04:39.970> how<00:04:40.030> to<00:04:40.120> explain<00:04:40.360> it<00:04:40.419> she'll<00:04:40.930> get

00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:41.020 
don't know how to explain it she'll get

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:42.810 
don't know how to explain it she'll get
her<00:04:41.140> own<00:04:41.260> like<00:04:41.440> standard<00:04:42.250> transformation

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:42.820 
her own like standard transformation

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:45.090 
her own like standard transformation
sequence<00:04:43.180> that's<00:04:43.480> not<00:04:43.690> just<00:04:43.960> like<00:04:44.140> part<00:04:44.890> of

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:05.310 
long just a little taste of the full
episode<00:05:03.160> but<00:05:03.940> at<00:05:04.210> this<00:05:04.450> point<00:05:04.690> it's<00:05:05.020> been<00:05:05.169> so

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:05.320
