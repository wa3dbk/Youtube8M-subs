hello today we're going to look at some
simple<00:00:15.790> ways<00:00:16.120> of<00:00:16.510> bending<00:00:17.320> some<00:00:17.560> sites<00:00:18.240> we

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:19.240 
simple ways of bending some sites we

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.100 
simple ways of bending some sites we
have<00:00:19.390> our<00:00:19.510> prepared<00:00:19.900> timber<00:00:20.290> which<00:00:20.590> is<00:00:22.110> 42

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:23.110 
have our prepared timber which is 42

millimeters which is a little bit

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:36.330 
millimeters which is a little bit
thinner<00:00:35.050> than<00:00:35.170> we<00:00:35.530> would<00:00:35.680> normally<00:00:35.710> use<00:00:36.129> for<00:00:36.160> a

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:36.340 
thinner than we would normally use for a

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:39.390 
thinner than we would normally use for a
guitar<00:00:37.470> since<00:00:38.470> we're<00:00:38.590> building<00:00:38.860> such<00:00:38.980> a<00:00:39.010> small

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:39.400 
guitar since we're building such a small

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:43.170 
guitar since we're building such a small
light<00:00:39.580> instrument<00:00:41.400> it's<00:00:42.400> preferable<00:00:42.850> to<00:00:42.910> have

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:43.180 
light instrument it's preferable to have

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.280 
light instrument it's preferable to have
between<00:00:43.780> 1.2<00:00:44.290> and<00:00:44.440> 1.6<00:00:45.129> I<00:00:45.670> would<00:00:45.820> say

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:46.290 
between 1.2 and 1.6 I would say

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:50.750 
between 1.2 and 1.6 I would say
depending<00:00:47.290> on<00:00:47.379> the<00:00:47.440> timber<00:00:48.720> okay<00:00:49.720> so<00:00:49.780> we<00:00:50.110> have

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:50.760 
depending on the timber okay so we have

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:57.899 
depending on the timber okay so we have
our<00:00:51.760> former<00:00:52.690> which<00:00:53.229> is<00:00:56.400> which<00:00:57.400> has<00:00:57.430> the<00:00:57.699> half

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:57.909 
our former which is which has the half

00:00:57.909 --> 00:01:01.140 
our former which is which has the half
side<00:00:58.269> of<00:00:58.479> the<00:00:58.629> ribs<00:00:59.640> and<00:01:00.640> we<00:01:00.760> have<00:01:00.879> two<00:01:01.059> of

side of the ribs and we have two of

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:07.520 
side of the ribs and we have two of
those<00:01:01.239> one<00:01:01.449> for<00:01:01.720> left<00:01:01.900> and<00:01:02.140> one<00:01:02.680> for<00:01:02.920> the<00:01:03.010> right

we've got our clapping without you know
just<00:02:48.380> the<00:02:48.500> water<00:02:48.650> slightly<00:02:49.610> orange<00:02:49.880> and

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:50.360 
just the water slightly orange and

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.120 
just the water slightly orange and
that's<00:02:50.510> the<00:02:50.660> staining<00:02:51.050> from<00:02:51.320> the<00:02:51.470> gun<00:02:51.680> that's

00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:52.130 
that's the staining from the gun that's

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:56.860 
that's the staining from the gun that's
in<00:02:52.340> the<00:02:52.520> tray<00:02:52.820> would<00:02:55.420> what<00:02:56.420> different<00:02:56.720> words

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:56.870 
in the tray would what different words

00:02:56.870 --> 00:02:59.500 
in the tray would what different words
will<00:02:57.020> have<00:02:57.140> different<00:02:57.290> colors<00:02:58.240> this<00:02:59.240> is<00:02:59.360> one

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
will have different colors this is one

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:00.940 
will have different colors this is one
of<00:02:59.540> disadvantages<00:03:00.350> of<00:03:00.380> the<00:03:00.530> method<00:03:00.830> if<00:03:00.920> you

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:00.950 
of disadvantages of the method if you

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:02.860 
of disadvantages of the method if you
have<00:03:01.130> a<00:03:01.160> very<00:03:01.430> highly<00:03:01.910> colored<00:03:02.300> piece<00:03:02.570> that

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:02.870 
have a very highly colored piece that

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:04.540 
have a very highly colored piece that
you<00:03:02.959> can<00:03:03.200> do<00:03:03.440> some<00:03:03.680> of<00:03:03.709> the<00:03:03.830> color<00:03:04.040> from<00:03:04.130> steam

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:04.550 
you can do some of the color from steam

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:11.290 
you can do some of the color from steam
this<00:03:04.970> way<00:03:08.980> very<00:03:09.980> careful<00:03:10.400> is<00:03:10.489> the<00:03:11.030> water<00:03:11.180> still

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:11.300 
this way very careful is the water still

00:03:11.300 --> 00:04:37.659 
this way very careful is the water still
very<00:03:11.720> very<00:03:11.930> important<00:03:14.019> at<00:03:15.019> the<00:03:15.080> time

00:04:37.659 --> 00:04:37.669 

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:40.270

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.570 
show you the end I decided to camp it
this<00:04:41.280> way<00:04:41.490> as<00:04:41.610> well<00:04:41.640> so<00:04:42.270> that<00:04:42.450> the<00:04:43.039> the<00:04:44.039> tail

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.580 
this way as well so that the the tail

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:51.050 
this way as well so that the the tail
part<00:04:44.820> here<00:04:45.090> was<00:04:45.950> secure<00:04:46.950> enough<00:04:49.820> should<00:04:50.820> be<00:04:50.940> it

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060 
part here was secure enough should be it

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:54.170 
part here was secure enough should be it
now<00:04:51.240> just<00:04:51.539> a<00:04:51.660> couple<00:04:51.960> of<00:04:52.080> days<00:04:52.669> would<00:04:53.669> dry<00:04:54.150> out

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:54.180 
now just a couple of days would dry out

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:55.730 
now just a couple of days would dry out
properly<00:04:54.570> this<00:04:54.780> isn't<00:04:55.050> the<00:04:55.110> survivors<00:04:55.620> we

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:55.740 
properly this isn't the survivors we

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.909 
properly this isn't the survivors we
have<00:04:55.889> to<00:04:55.979> allow<00:04:56.130> it<00:04:56.160> to<00:04:56.310> dry<00:04:57.560> once<00:04:58.560> it's<00:04:58.740> dry

00:04:58.909 --> 00:04:58.919 
have to allow it to dry once it's dry

00:04:58.919 --> 00:05:00.860 
have to allow it to dry once it's dry
then<00:04:59.160> we<00:04:59.340> can<00:04:59.520> start<00:04:59.940> putting<00:05:00.030> the<00:05:00.360> mold<00:05:00.539> and

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:00.870 
then we can start putting the mold and

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:03.830 
then we can start putting the mold and
glue<00:05:01.260> the<00:05:01.410> blocks<00:05:01.560> in
