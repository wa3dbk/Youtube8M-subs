00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:48.650 
just look at these mp4s here so here

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:51.610 
just look at these mp4s here so here
they<00:00:48.770> are<00:00:48.800> in<00:00:49.160> our<00:00:50.000> BP<00:00:50.630> AV<00:00:50.930> folder<00:00:51.380> and<00:00:51.560> then

they are in our BP AV folder and then
our<00:00:52.430> CLP<00:00:53.000> our<00:00:53.120> folder<00:00:53.510> we<00:00:53.690> see<00:00:53.930> all<00:00:54.200> of<00:00:54.350> our

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:02.110 
premier and it's asking me for a new
project<00:01:01.190> and<00:01:01.340> we're<00:01:01.460> just<00:01:01.580> going<00:01:01.820> to<00:01:01.880> call

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:09.160 
project and we're just going to call
this<00:01:02.150> a<00:01:02.480> gym<00:01:03.140> 100<00:01:03.860> demo<00:01:05.680> and<00:01:07.630> now<00:01:08.630> it's

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:09.170 
this a gym 100 demo and now it's

at this point is Adobe Premiere looks at

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:33.640 
at this point is Adobe Premiere looks at
all<00:02:31.730> of<00:02:31.849> those<00:02:31.939> folders<00:02:32.420> only<00:02:33.200> brings<00:02:33.409> in<00:02:33.560> the

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:33.650 
all of those folders only brings in the

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:35.890 
all of those folders only brings in the
files<00:02:33.920> that<00:02:34.190> it<00:02:34.310> needs<00:02:34.549> and<00:02:34.849> it<00:02:35.390> will<00:02:35.540> tell<00:02:35.690> you

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:35.900 
files that it needs and it will tell you

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:37.569 
files that it needs and it will tell you
it<00:02:36.200> doesn't<00:02:36.769> understand<00:02:37.250> what<00:02:37.370> all<00:02:37.400> these

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:37.579 
it doesn't understand what all these

00:02:37.579 --> 00:02:39.100 
it doesn't understand what all these
other<00:02:37.730> files<00:02:38.000> are<00:02:38.209> that's<00:02:38.420> fine<00:02:38.690> because<00:02:38.930> it

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
other files are that's fine because it

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.440 
other files are that's fine because it
doesn't<00:02:39.319> need<00:02:39.470> these<00:02:39.709> XML<00:02:40.610> and<00:02:40.849> these<00:02:41.000> be<00:02:41.150> IM

what I would recommend of course is as

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:04.479 
what I would recommend of course is as
always<00:03:02.329> backup<00:03:02.659> everything<00:03:03.049> first<00:03:03.769> so<00:03:04.159> copy

demo just showing you off of the card
here's<00:03:14.359> a<00:03:14.450> clip<00:03:14.690> here<00:03:14.750> we<00:03:15.379> hit<00:03:15.500> play<00:03:15.739> and<00:03:15.769> if<00:03:16.069> we

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:16.220 
here's a clip here we hit play and if we

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:21.729 
here's a clip here we hit play and if we
look<00:03:16.970> at<00:03:17.150> our<00:03:18.549> statistics<00:03:19.549> on<00:03:19.730> the<00:03:19.760> clip<00:03:20.739> we'll

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:21.739 
look at our statistics on the clip we'll

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:23.979 
look at our statistics on the clip we'll
see<00:03:21.919> that<00:03:22.069> they<00:03:22.190> are<00:03:22.220> 23.976<00:03:23.090> frames<00:03:23.780> per

00:03:23.979 --> 00:03:23.989 
see that they are 23.976 frames per

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:29.050 
see that they are 23.976 frames per
second<00:03:24.410> meaning<00:03:24.739> 24p<00:03:25.430> and<00:03:27.220> they're<00:03:28.220> 1920<00:03:28.910> x

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
second meaning 24p and they're 1920 x

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.289 
second meaning 24p and they're 1920 x
1080<00:03:29.680> now<00:03:30.680> we<00:03:31.129> have<00:03:31.340> our<00:03:31.370> sequence<00:03:31.940> here<00:03:32.150> we

00:03:32.289 --> 00:03:32.299 
1080 now we have our sequence here we

00:03:32.299 --> 00:03:34.119 
1080 now we have our sequence here we
can<00:03:32.419> just<00:03:32.569> start<00:03:32.989> dragging<00:03:33.290> some<00:03:33.650> clips<00:03:33.919> into

00:03:34.119 --> 00:03:34.129 
can just start dragging some clips into

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:37.839 
can just start dragging some clips into
our<00:03:34.310> sequence<00:03:35.620> there<00:03:36.620> we<00:03:36.799> go<00:03:36.949> and<00:03:37.579> we<00:03:37.699> can

00:03:37.839 --> 00:03:37.849 
our sequence there we go and we can

00:03:37.849 --> 00:03:41.920 
our sequence there we go and we can
start<00:03:38.060> editing<00:03:38.239> immediately<00:03:40.750> now<00:03:41.750> what

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:41.930 
start editing immediately now what

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:44.500 
start editing immediately now what
happens<00:03:42.260> if<00:03:42.379> we<00:03:42.500> have<00:03:42.680> some<00:03:42.889> MOV<00:03:43.340> files<00:03:43.639> well

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:44.510 
happens if we have some MOV files well

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.770 
happens if we have some MOV files well
on<00:03:44.720> the<00:03:44.989> Mac<00:03:45.260> there's<00:03:46.190> a<00:03:46.280> free<00:03:46.549> solution<00:03:47.120> well

completely unnecessary so now we can

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:08.250 
completely unnecessary so now we can
