when was last time you last updated and
so<00:03:32.220> forth<00:03:32.459> so<00:03:33.000> overall<00:03:33.450> or<00:03:33.690> actually<00:03:34.020> there's

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170 
so forth so overall or actually there's

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:35.390 
so forth so overall or actually there's
one<00:03:34.200> more<00:03:34.380> feature<00:03:34.560> i<00:03:34.680> forgot<00:03:34.950> to<00:03:34.980> mention<00:03:35.070> is

00:03:35.390 --> 00:03:35.400 
one more feature i forgot to mention is

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.140 
one more feature i forgot to mention is
that<00:03:35.430> the<00:03:35.700> unread<00:03:36.540> unread<00:03:37.940> counter<00:03:38.940> on<00:03:39.060> the

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:39.150 
that the unread unread counter on the

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:42.110 
that the unread unread counter on the
bottom<00:03:39.420> of<00:03:39.630> every<00:03:39.959> single<00:03:40.200> tab<00:03:40.560> as<00:03:41.370> you<00:03:42.000> can

00:03:42.110 --> 00:03:42.120 
bottom of every single tab as you can

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.030 
bottom of every single tab as you can
see<00:03:42.209> every<00:03:42.420> single<00:03:42.630> tab<00:03:42.750> has<00:03:42.959> that<00:03:43.680> unread

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.040 
see every single tab has that unread

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.820 
see every single tab has that unread
bottom<00:03:44.760> bottom<00:03:45.450> part<00:03:45.750> so<00:03:46.320> that's<00:03:46.590> pretty<00:03:46.739> much

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:46.830 
bottom bottom part so that's pretty much

00:03:46.830 --> 00:03:48.920 
bottom bottom part so that's pretty much
flood<00:03:47.220> there's<00:03:47.880> not<00:03:48.030> that<00:03:48.090> many<00:03:48.300> sources<00:03:48.690> it's

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:48.930 
flood there's not that many sources it's

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:50.720 
flood there's not that many sources it's
really<00:03:49.200> closed<00:03:49.470> down<00:03:49.650> kind<00:03:50.160> of<00:03:50.190> like<00:03:50.340> Apple

really closed down kind of like Apple

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:52.460 
really closed down kind of like Apple

aesthetically<00:04:03.780> pleasing<00:04:03.810> I<00:04:04.380> like<00:04:05.370> a<00:04:05.400> lot<00:04:05.700> but

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:05.970 
aesthetically pleasing I like a lot but

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:08.210 
aesthetically pleasing I like a lot but
one<00:04:06.690> downside<00:04:07.050> a<00:04:07.110> huge<00:04:07.440> downside<00:04:07.709> is<00:04:08.160> that

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:08.220 
one downside a huge downside is that

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.690 
one downside a huge downside is that
there's<00:04:09.030> not<00:04:09.180> that<00:04:09.239> many<00:04:10.520> sources<00:04:11.520> you<00:04:11.670> can

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:11.700 
there's not that many sources you can

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:14.600 
there's not that many sources you can
read<00:04:11.970> stories<00:04:12.720> from<00:04:12.900> and<00:04:13.140> the<00:04:13.500> reason<00:04:13.770> why<00:04:13.950> it

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:14.610 
read stories from and the reason why it

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:17.060 
read stories from and the reason why it
looks<00:04:14.820> so<00:04:14.910> the<00:04:15.540> views<00:04:15.930> look<00:04:16.320> so<00:04:16.470> pretty<00:04:16.739> and

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
looks so the views look so pretty and

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:19.820 
looks so the views look so pretty and
you<00:04:17.430> know<00:04:17.520> beautiful<00:04:18.000> is<00:04:18.299> because<00:04:18.720> that<00:04:19.380> they

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:19.830 
you know beautiful is because that they

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:21.289 
you know beautiful is because that they
all<00:04:20.130> those<00:04:20.370> sources<00:04:20.609> they<00:04:20.760> have<00:04:20.970> they<00:04:21.180> have

00:04:21.289 --> 00:04:21.299 
all those sources they have they have

00:04:21.299 --> 00:04:23.810 
all those sources they have they have
photos<00:04:21.660> next<00:04:21.930> to<00:04:21.989> each<00:04:22.109> article<00:04:22.740> so<00:04:23.100> it<00:04:23.610> would

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
photos next to each article so it would

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:25.279 
photos next to each article so it would
get<00:04:24.060> that<00:04:24.240> would<00:04:24.390> result<00:04:24.660> in<00:04:24.810> this<00:04:24.930> thumbnail

00:04:25.279 --> 00:04:25.289 
get that would result in this thumbnail

00:04:25.289 --> 00:04:26.720 
get that would result in this thumbnail
otherwise<00:04:25.680> if<00:04:25.979> there's<00:04:26.160> just

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:26.730 
otherwise if there's just

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:28.520 
otherwise if there's just
will<00:04:27.270> be<00:04:27.360> kind<00:04:27.540> of<00:04:27.570> boring<00:04:27.750> and<00:04:28.080> it<00:04:28.410> would<00:04:28.500> not

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:28.530 
will be kind of boring and it would not

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:30.200 
will be kind of boring and it would not
be<00:04:28.710> not<00:04:28.920> there<00:04:29.250> will<00:04:29.340> not<00:04:29.460> be<00:04:29.520> many<00:04:29.700> visuals

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:30.210 
be not there will not be many visuals

00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.900 
be not there will not be many visuals
and<00:04:30.450> the<00:04:31.380> whole<00:04:31.590> UI<00:04:31.950> content<00:04:32.520> would<00:04:32.580> just<00:04:32.760> fall

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:32.910 
and the whole UI content would just fall

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:34.970 
and the whole UI content would just fall
apart<00:04:33.000> in<00:04:33.300> terms<00:04:33.420> of<00:04:33.600> the<00:04:33.720> title<00:04:34.020> you<00:04:34.170> are<00:04:34.320> so
