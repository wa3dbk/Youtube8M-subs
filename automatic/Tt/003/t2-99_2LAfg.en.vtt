00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:06.000
 so we're on the set of these 

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.880
 champions with laurence gazelle the bellboy 

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.110
 kevin staut hello laurence so 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:13.500
 thank you for coming the shoot went well 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.269
 past bompard done then we had a lot 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.820
 Internet questions for you 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:19.949
 so we will start with a question of 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:24.420
 valentine what studies should be done 

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:29.660
 to become a groom not at all agree 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.660
 even she is in my opinion course 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:36.800
 learn as you go 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:38.850
 as we say in our jargon 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.100
 okay and about that it falls very 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:42.690
 well a question of the stelae that asks 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.160
 have you encountered problems with 

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:48.390
 riders or horses to your 

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:49.430
 bellboy debut name was always good 

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.140
 past 

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:55.559
 yes hair maybe they have 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:58.440
 cure is it difficult maybe the 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:04.110
 Characteristic care yes because it's 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:06.450
 as I started young horses 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.770
 so that's for sure it was hot is 

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:10.920
 a lot more character what we 

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:13.110
 learns game three years a lot he has i have 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.890
 encountered choices it's difficult but 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:18.810
 since fulchieri kevin do not eat 

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:21.030
 of agreement then it is a matter of 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:22.979
 camille how do you manage from a point of 

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:28.140
 emotional view possible departures from 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:30.320
 horses you're dealing with that I 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.710
 think we can not handle 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:37.080
 I lost a horse that left 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:39.320
 who was finally of heart this prestige 

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.320
 st laws 

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:44.659
 I think it will be part 2 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:46.159
 demont 

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:50.170
 will always be in my heart until the 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:52.390
 end and we can not really manage 

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:55.159
 okay and finally one last question 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:57.640

00:01:55.159 --> 00:02:02.750

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:05.530
 it's a question of sarah my best 

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:07.210
 remember with kevin c 

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:11.260

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:13.860
 of aix-la-chapel with silvana yes and 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:19.050
 my worst memory with kevin c 

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:20.280
