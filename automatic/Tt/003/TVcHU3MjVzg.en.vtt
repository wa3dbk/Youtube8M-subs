this<00:04:38.490> you<00:04:38.640> would<00:04:38.880> get<00:04:39.060> that<00:04:39.950> so<00:04:40.950> I'll<00:04:41.370> play

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:41.940 
this you would get that so I'll play

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:43.010 
this you would get that so I'll play
around<00:04:42.090> with<00:04:42.240> that<00:04:42.360> in<00:04:42.510> the<00:04:42.570> moment<00:04:42.840> I've<00:04:42.990> got

00:04:43.010 --> 00:04:43.020 
around with that in the moment I've got

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:46.310 
around with that in the moment I've got
an<00:04:43.229> adapter<00:04:43.650> so<00:04:43.680> we<00:04:44.070> will<00:04:44.390> in<00:04:45.390> a<00:04:45.900> another

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:46.320 
an adapter so we will in a another

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:48.230 
an adapter so we will in a another
review<00:04:46.800> actually<00:04:47.070> we're<00:04:47.400> testing<00:04:47.850> the<00:04:47.970> speed

00:04:48.230 --> 00:04:48.240 
review actually we're testing the speed

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.210 
review actually we're testing the speed
of<00:04:48.390> this<00:04:48.570> just<00:04:49.470> to<00:04:49.530> see<00:04:49.740> how<00:04:49.890> well<00:04:50.070> it<00:04:50.100> does

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:50.220 
of this just to see how well it does

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:52.280 
of this just to see how well it does
actually<00:04:50.550> perform<00:04:51.060> and<00:04:51.240> how<00:04:51.360> easy<00:04:51.810> it<00:04:51.900> is<00:04:52.050> to

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:52.290 
actually perform and how easy it is to

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:56.170 
actually perform and how easy it is to
set<00:04:52.500> up<00:04:52.530> the<00:04:53.400> own<00:04:53.820> important<00:04:54.180> USB<00:04:54.540> 3.0<00:04:55.080> cable

00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:56.180 
set up the own important USB 3.0 cable

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:58.940 
set up the own important USB 3.0 cable
the<00:04:57.180> music<00:04:57.479> over<00:04:57.720> there<00:04:57.900> and<00:04:58.440> this<00:04:58.590> is<00:04:58.770> natural

00:04:58.940 --> 00:04:58.950 
the music over there and this is natural

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:01.940 
the music over there and this is natural
drive<00:04:59.340> um<00:04:59.700> I<00:05:00.140> don't<00:05:01.140> think<00:05:01.260> I<00:05:01.560> have<00:05:01.770> no

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:01.950 
drive um I don't think I have no

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:04.700 
drive um I don't think I have no
straight<00:05:02.310> away<00:05:02.520> the<00:05:02.669> actual<00:05:02.790> drive<00:05:03.120> is<00:05:03.450> is<00:05:03.840> my

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:04.710 
straight away the actual drive is is my

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:07.550 
straight away the actual drive is is my
heavy<00:05:04.919> actually<00:05:05.400> and<00:05:05.729> a<00:05:06.570> lot<00:05:06.780> heavier<00:05:07.169> than<00:05:07.290> I

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:07.560 
heavy actually and a lot heavier than I

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:10.130 
heavy actually and a lot heavier than I
actually<00:05:07.740> thought<00:05:08.160> it<00:05:08.370> would<00:05:08.490> be<00:05:08.720> so<00:05:09.720> that's

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:10.140 
actually thought it would be so that's

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:12.909 
actually thought it would be so that's
the<00:05:10.410> front<00:05:11.120> somehow<00:05:12.120> got<00:05:12.300> the<00:05:12.330> OneTouch

00:05:12.909 --> 00:05:12.919 
the front somehow got the OneTouch

00:05:12.919 --> 00:05:15.469 
the front somehow got the OneTouch
button<00:05:13.919> here<00:05:14.160> I'm<00:05:14.370> sue<00:05:14.580> mentioned<00:05:14.790> it's<00:05:15.210> USB

00:05:15.469 --> 00:05:15.479 
button here I'm sue mentioned it's USB

00:05:15.479 --> 00:05:19.340 
button here I'm sue mentioned it's USB

embossed<00:05:19.770> into<00:05:20.070> the<00:05:20.520> side<00:05:20.760> panel<00:05:21.150> here<00:05:21.180> I<00:05:21.570> see

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:22.410 
embossed into the side panel here I see

00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:24.350 
embossed into the side panel here I see
some<00:05:22.650> a<00:05:22.919> couple<00:05:23.610> of<00:05:23.669> the<00:05:23.760> holds<00:05:24.060> there<00:05:24.210> for

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:24.360 
some a couple of the holds there for

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:28.370 
some a couple of the holds there for
ventilation<00:05:24.810> and<00:05:25.460> again<00:05:26.460> on<00:05:26.580> that<00:05:26.760> side<00:05:27.380> and

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:28.380 
ventilation and again on that side and

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:30.500 
ventilation and again on that side and
the<00:05:28.560> bottom<00:05:28.740> got<00:05:29.130> some<00:05:29.310> holes<00:05:29.520> for

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:30.510 
the bottom got some holes for

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:32.570 
the bottom got some holes for
ventilation<00:05:30.540> I<00:05:31.169> think<00:05:31.350> that's<00:05:31.470> going<00:05:31.620> to<00:05:31.680> draw

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:32.580 
ventilation I think that's going to draw

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:36.110 
ventilation I think that's going to draw
the<00:05:32.640> cool<00:05:32.940> air<00:05:33.120> in<00:05:33.360> at<00:05:33.810> the<00:05:33.900> bottom<00:05:34.430> and<00:05:35.430> let<00:05:36.000> it

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:36.120 
the cool air in at the bottom and let it

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:38.420 
the cool air in at the bottom and let it
escape<00:05:36.390> naturally<00:05:37.349> through

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:38.430 
escape naturally through

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:40.950 
escape naturally through
can't<00:05:39.430> really<00:05:39.580> see<00:05:39.819> inside<00:05:39.999> the<00:05:40.419> actual<00:05:40.539> drive

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:40.960 
can't really see inside the actual drive

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:43.890 
can't really see inside the actual drive
so<00:05:41.740> hopefully<00:05:42.550> with<00:05:42.789> a<00:05:43.060> bit<00:05:43.479> of<00:05:43.509> software<00:05:43.870> that

00:05:43.890 --> 00:05:43.900 
so hopefully with a bit of software that

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:46.110 
so hopefully with a bit of software that
we<00:05:44.110> have<00:05:44.259> when<00:05:44.800> maybe<00:05:45.310> try<00:05:45.639> and<00:05:45.729> find<00:05:45.849> out<00:05:45.969> what

00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:46.120 
we have when maybe try and find out what

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:48.749 
we have when maybe try and find out what
drive<00:05:46.360> they<00:05:46.569> actually<00:05:46.900> use<00:05:47.050> in<00:05:47.289> this<00:05:47.610> on<00:05:48.610> the

00:05:48.749 --> 00:05:48.759 
drive they actually use in this on the

00:05:48.759 --> 00:05:52.589 
drive they actually use in this on the
back<00:05:48.939> we<00:05:49.180> do<00:05:49.300> have<00:05:49.509> the<00:05:49.659> USB<00:05:50.139> 3.0<00:05:51.180> port<00:05:52.180> to

00:05:52.589 --> 00:05:52.599 
back we do have the USB 3.0 port to

00:05:52.599 --> 00:05:55.409 
back we do have the USB 3.0 port to
connect<00:05:52.900> the<00:05:52.990> cable<00:05:53.289> to<00:05:53.319> and<00:05:53.650> the<00:05:54.430> power<00:05:54.849> in<00:05:55.150> as

00:05:55.409 --> 00:05:55.419 
connect the cable to and the power in as

00:05:55.419 --> 00:05:58.499 
connect the cable to and the power in as
well<00:05:55.719> so<00:05:56.229> what<00:05:56.830> we<00:05:56.889> want<00:05:57.009> to<00:05:57.099> do<00:05:57.219> is<00:05:58.029> just<00:05:58.270> power

00:05:58.499 --> 00:05:58.509 
well so what we want to do is just power

00:05:58.509 --> 00:06:00.839 
well so what we want to do is just power
this<00:05:58.689> up<00:05:58.870> so<00:05:59.110> you<00:05:59.199> can<00:05:59.349> have<00:05:59.499> a<00:05:59.529> quick<00:05:59.800> look<00:05:59.949> and

00:06:00.839 --> 00:06:00.849 
this up so you can have a quick look and

00:06:00.849 --> 00:06:04.080 
this up so you can have a quick look and
see<00:06:01.090> what<00:06:01.419> the<00:06:01.719> writing<00:06:02.439> looks<00:06:03.039> like<00:06:03.310> on<00:06:03.610> the

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:04.090 
see what the writing looks like on the

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:07.129 
see what the writing looks like on the
led<00:06:05.099> okay<00:06:06.099> so<00:06:06.159> what<00:06:06.370> I've<00:06:06.460> now<00:06:06.610> done<00:06:06.669> is

00:06:07.129 --> 00:06:07.139 
led okay so what I've now done is

00:06:07.139 --> 00:06:10.469 
led okay so what I've now done is
untangled<00:06:08.139> the<00:06:08.279> cable<00:06:09.279> itself<00:06:09.789> for<00:06:10.029> the<00:06:10.120> power

00:06:10.469 --> 00:06:10.479 
untangled the cable itself for the power

00:06:10.479 --> 00:06:12.570 
untangled the cable itself for the power
adapter<00:06:10.990> and<00:06:11.379> I've<00:06:11.469> also<00:06:11.800> connected<00:06:12.219> out<00:06:12.339> to

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:12.580 
adapter and I've also connected out to

00:06:12.580 --> 00:06:15.809 
adapter and I've also connected out to
my<00:06:12.699> PC<00:06:13.569> now<00:06:14.259> as<00:06:14.650> you<00:06:15.039> can<00:06:15.159> see<00:06:15.219> with<00:06:15.460> the<00:06:15.580> lights

00:06:15.809 --> 00:06:15.819 
my PC now as you can see with the lights

00:06:15.819 --> 00:06:18.119 
my PC now as you can see with the lights
hopefully<00:06:16.360> flickering<00:06:16.900> away<00:06:17.289> there<00:06:17.560> you<00:06:17.770> can

00:06:18.119 --> 00:06:18.129 
hopefully flickering away there you can

00:06:18.129 --> 00:06:19.589 
hopefully flickering away there you can
see<00:06:18.339> I'll<00:06:18.430> see<00:06:18.610> how<00:06:18.759> bright<00:06:19.060> the<00:06:19.270> actual

00:06:19.589 --> 00:06:19.599 
see I'll see how bright the actual

00:06:19.599 --> 00:06:22.050 
see I'll see how bright the actual
blue-ringed<00:06:20.050> LED<00:06:20.800> is<00:06:21.069> around<00:06:21.580> the<00:06:21.699> outside

00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:22.060 
blue-ringed LED is around the outside

00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:23.399 
blue-ringed LED is around the outside
which<00:06:22.300> was<00:06:22.360> quite<00:06:22.689> nice

00:06:23.399 --> 00:06:23.409 
which was quite nice

00:06:23.409 --> 00:06:25.379 
which was quite nice
there<00:06:23.710> is<00:06:23.830> no<00:06:24.039> on/off<00:06:24.339> switch<00:06:24.819> on<00:06:25.089> this

00:06:25.379 --> 00:06:25.389 
there is no on/off switch on this

00:06:25.389 --> 00:06:27.510 
there is no on/off switch on this
particular<00:06:25.779> device<00:06:26.319> it<00:06:26.770> does<00:06:26.949> have<00:06:27.099> the<00:06:27.249> sleep

00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:27.520 
particular device it does have the sleep

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:29.700 
particular device it does have the sleep
mode<00:06:27.759> and<00:06:27.969> but<00:06:28.719> probably<00:06:29.020> would<00:06:29.169> be<00:06:29.289> nice<00:06:29.469> to

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:29.710 
mode and but probably would be nice to

00:06:29.710 --> 00:06:33.350 
mode and but probably would be nice to
see<00:06:30.039> an<00:06:30.159> on-off<00:06:30.430> switch<00:06:30.460> on<00:06:30.879> there<00:06:31.060> as<00:06:31.180> well

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:33.360 

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:35.969 

not<00:06:34.360> very<00:06:34.539> much<00:06:34.719> vibration<00:06:35.379> coming<00:06:35.650> from<00:06:35.800> the

00:06:35.969 --> 00:06:35.979 
not very much vibration coming from the

00:06:35.979 --> 00:06:39.269
