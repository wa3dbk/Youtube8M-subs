Spellbinders just show you the home page
of<00:01:44.610> it<00:01:45.290> so<00:01:46.290> this<00:01:46.409> is<00:01:46.560> the<00:01:46.710> way<00:01:46.829> owner<00:01:47.070> actually

00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:47.340 
of it so this is the way owner actually

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.050 
of it so this is the way owner actually
you<00:01:47.640> can<00:01:47.790> make<00:01:47.970> these<00:01:48.180> pages<00:01:48.540> go<00:01:49.200> on<00:01:49.439> and<00:01:49.590> on

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:50.060 
you can make these pages go on and on

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:51.980 
you can make these pages go on and on
underneath<00:01:51.060> of<00:01:51.240> course<00:01:51.450> you<00:01:51.540> could<00:01:51.659> put<00:01:51.810> some

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:51.990 
underneath of course you could put some

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:54.530 
underneath of course you could put some
different<00:01:52.290> kinds<00:01:52.590> of<00:01:52.649> smaller<00:01:53.070> pages<00:01:53.520> so<00:01:54.509> I

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
different kinds of smaller pages so I

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.469 
different kinds of smaller pages so I
just<00:01:54.990> did<00:01:55.470> some<00:01:55.500> cutting<00:01:56.009> with<00:01:56.280> from<00:01:56.850> the<00:01:57.060> I

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
just did some cutting with from the I

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:01.399 
just did some cutting with from the I
think<00:01:58.140> it<00:01:58.380> was<00:01:58.409> the<00:01:58.860> actually<00:01:59.700> graphic<00:02:00.570> 45s<00:02:01.290> on

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
think it was the actually graphic 45s on

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.069 
think it was the actually graphic 45s on
the<00:02:01.500> boardwalk<00:02:01.829> paper<00:02:02.310> as<00:02:02.939> well<00:02:03.570> as<00:02:03.719> Bilbo

00:02:04.069 --> 00:02:04.079 
the boardwalk paper as well as Bilbo

find were to put in some extra pages I
mean<00:05:08.890> this<00:05:09.520> one<00:05:09.730> would<00:05:10.000> look<00:05:10.030> like<00:05:10.330> a<00:05:10.770> man<00:05:11.770> or

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:12.010 
mean this one would look like a man or

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:13.830 
mean this one would look like a man or
something<00:05:12.070> I<00:05:12.520> mean<00:05:12.610> it's<00:05:13.000> just<00:05:13.030> fan-out<00:05:13.450> what

00:05:13.830 --> 00:05:13.840 
something I mean it's just fan-out what

it<00:05:13.990> is<00:05:14.170> I<00:05:14.520> like<00:05:15.520> it<00:05:15.780> so<00:05:16.780> my<00:05:17.410> thought<00:05:17.800> is

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:17.830 
it is I like it so my thought is

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:19.920

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:25.510 
over the measurements of that one and

00:05:25.510 --> 00:05:27.930 
over the measurements of that one and
the<00:05:26.020> same<00:05:26.260> thing<00:05:26.590> goes<00:05:26.650> for<00:05:27.190> this<00:05:27.520> one<00:05:27.580> for

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:27.940 
the same thing goes for this one for

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:29.790 
the same thing goes for this one for
example<00:05:28.000> I<00:05:28.600> could<00:05:28.900> put<00:05:29.020> in<00:05:29.170> some<00:05:29.200> papers
