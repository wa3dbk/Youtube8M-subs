00:00:18.359 --> 00:00:20.060 
is because if you get your Johnny bar
your<00:00:18.960> breaker<00:00:19.199> bar<00:00:19.470> or<00:00:19.560> whatever<00:00:19.710> you<00:00:19.890> want<00:00:20.010> to

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
your breaker bar or whatever you want to

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:22.340 
your breaker bar or whatever you want to
call<00:00:20.189> it<00:00:20.359> once<00:00:21.359> it's<00:00:21.510> on<00:00:21.720> the<00:00:21.840> car<00:00:22.020> like<00:00:22.199> this

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.350 
call it once it's on the car like this

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:23.810 
call it once it's on the car like this
you<00:00:22.710> can<00:00:22.830> see<00:00:22.980> what<00:00:23.100> the<00:00:23.220> wheel<00:00:23.369> is<00:00:23.550> turning

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
you can see what the wheel is turning

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:26.420 
you can see what the wheel is turning
and<00:00:24.230> it's<00:00:25.230> gonna<00:00:25.380> be<00:00:25.470> very<00:00:25.650> difficult<00:00:25.890> to<00:00:26.220> take

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
and it's gonna be very difficult to take

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.730 
and it's gonna be very difficult to take
the<00:00:26.609> wheel<00:00:26.760> off<00:00:27.029> because<00:00:27.570> you<00:00:27.810> can't<00:00:27.840> hold<00:00:28.439> and

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:28.740 
the wheel off because you can't hold and

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:32.120 
the wheel off because you can't hold and
turn<00:00:29.490> at<00:00:29.609> the<00:00:29.670> same<00:00:29.849> time<00:00:30.090> so<00:00:31.019> an<00:00:31.260> easy<00:00:31.949> way

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.130 
turn at the same time so an easy way

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:34.370 
turn at the same time so an easy way
that<00:00:32.309> I<00:00:32.340> like<00:00:32.550> to<00:00:32.579> take<00:00:32.820> it<00:00:32.940> off<00:00:33.059> without<00:00:33.960> using

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380 
that I like to take it off without using

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.130 
that I like to take it off without using
these<00:00:34.530> is<00:00:34.800> just<00:00:35.130> like<00:00:35.610> this<00:00:35.930> so<00:00:36.930> with<00:00:37.050> the

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140 
these is just like this so with the

these is just like this so with the
Koran<00:00:37.380> here<00:00:37.590> and<00:00:37.770> the<00:00:37.829> wheel<00:00:37.980> able<00:00:38.340> to<00:00:38.460> spin

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
Koran here and the wheel able to spin

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.950 
Koran here and the wheel able to spin
you're<00:00:38.910> gonna<00:00:39.000> want<00:00:39.180> to<00:00:39.210> get<00:00:39.390> your<00:00:40.379> socket<00:00:41.960> put

00:00:46.279 --> 00:00:46.289 
it on the lug nut attach it to your

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:48.529 
it on the lug nut attach it to your
breaker<00:00:46.739> bar<00:00:46.890> and<00:00:47.160> then<00:00:48.030> you're<00:00:48.149> gonna<00:00:48.239> turn

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
breaker bar and then you're gonna turn

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.380 
breaker bar and then you're gonna turn
it<00:00:48.690> clockwise<00:00:49.500> and<00:00:50.160> then<00:00:50.730> quickly<00:00:51.030> with<00:00:51.300> the

it clockwise and then quickly with the

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.299 
it clockwise and then quickly with the
breaker<00:00:51.629> bar<00:00:51.930> yank<00:00:52.800> it<00:00:52.980> counterclockwise

00:00:53.299 --> 00:00:53.309 
breaker bar yank it counterclockwise

00:00:53.309 --> 00:00:56.350 
breaker bar yank it counterclockwise
just<00:00:53.969> like<00:00:54.539> this<00:00:54.719> so<00:00:55.289> with<00:00:55.649> just<00:00:55.680> one<00:00:56.010> hand

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:56.360 
just like this so with just one hand

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:58.369 
just like this so with just one hand
turn<00:00:57.360> it<00:00:57.480> one<00:00:57.600> way<00:00:57.629> and<00:00:57.750> then<00:00:58.020> crank<00:00:58.230> it

00:00:58.369 --> 00:00:58.379 
turn it one way and then crank it

00:00:58.379 --> 00:01:02.240 
turn it one way and then crank it
together<00:00:58.559> just<00:00:59.750> like<00:01:00.750> that<00:01:00.989> and<00:01:01.260> this<00:01:02.190> is

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
together just like that and this is

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.299 
together just like that and this is
loose<00:01:02.520> you<00:01:03.510> can<00:01:03.539> undo<00:01:03.899> it<00:01:04.040> you<00:01:05.040> I'll<00:01:05.159> show<00:01:05.280> you

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:05.309 
loose you can undo it you I'll show you

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.350 
loose you can undo it you I'll show you
again<00:01:06.140> so<00:01:07.140> it's<00:01:07.290> like<00:01:07.500> that<00:01:08.270> turn<00:01:09.270> it

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:09.360 
again so it's like that turn it

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.920 
again so it's like that turn it
clockwise<00:01:09.479> and<00:01:10.020> then<00:01:10.229> counterclockwise<00:01:11.930> just

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
clockwise and then counterclockwise just

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:16.249 
clockwise and then counterclockwise just
like<00:01:13.080> that<00:01:13.880> cuz<00:01:14.880> if<00:01:15.000> you<00:01:15.090> go<00:01:15.180> like<00:01:15.299> this<00:01:15.330> let's

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259 
like that cuz if you go like this let's

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.320 
like that cuz if you go like this let's
see<00:01:16.320> how<00:01:16.380> the<00:01:16.470> wheel<00:01:16.680> turns<00:01:17.000> the<00:01:18.000> reason<00:01:18.240> why

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:18.330 
see how the wheel turns the reason why

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.179 
see how the wheel turns the reason why
this<00:01:18.390> is<00:01:18.540> nice<00:01:18.780> is<00:01:19.170> because<00:01:19.560> you've<00:01:19.950> got<00:01:20.100> the

00:01:20.179 --> 00:01:20.189 
this is nice is because you've got the

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:21.800 
this is nice is because you've got the
weight<00:01:20.369> of<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.549> wheel<00:01:20.700> working<00:01:21.119> with<00:01:21.270> you<00:01:21.420> so

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
weight of the wheel working with you so

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.710 
weight of the wheel working with you so
you<00:01:22.170> turn<00:01:22.409> the<00:01:22.439> distance<00:01:23.009> and<00:01:23.310> yank<00:01:23.759> it<00:01:23.909> and<00:01:24.600> it

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:24.720 
you turn the distance and yank it and it

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:26.570 
you turn the distance and yank it and it
loosens<00:01:25.080> up<00:01:25.409> and<00:01:25.740> then<00:01:26.280> you<00:01:26.369> can<00:01:26.490> take

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
loosens up and then you can take

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.760 
loosens up and then you can take
everything<00:01:26.970> else<00:01:27.119> I<00:01:27.420> didn't<00:01:28.290> do<00:01:28.380> that<00:01:28.500> one<00:01:28.619> yet

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:28.770 
everything else I didn't do that one yet

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:32.450 
everything else I didn't do that one yet
but<00:01:29.780> you<00:01:30.780> can<00:01:30.869> take<00:01:31.049> the<00:01:31.140> lug<00:01:31.290> nut<00:01:31.439> up<00:01:31.619> like

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
but you can take the lug nut up like

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:33.920 
but you can take the lug nut up like
that<00:01:32.610> bite<00:01:32.820> in<00:01:33.030> it<00:01:33.060> and<00:01:33.659> you<00:01:33.720> don't<00:01:33.810> need

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930 
that bite in it and you don't need

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:35.330 
that bite in it and you don't need
anyone's<00:01:34.320> help<00:01:34.350> you<00:01:34.650> need<00:01:34.829> someone<00:01:35.070> to<00:01:35.130> press

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:36.810 
the brake you don't need someone to

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.600 
the brake you don't need someone to
lower<00:01:36.960> the<00:01:37.140> car<00:01:37.320> gonna<00:01:37.530> for<00:01:37.770> you<00:01:37.890> right<00:01:38.579> there
