 5 

00:00:10.749 --> 00:00:13.649
 Hello in this way i want to show you how to have some kind of 

00:00:13.649 --> 00:00:17.610
 Taxation of any windows pc can access on a Windows PC 

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:22.360
 in the scenario that the huge ones want to be help 

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:27.030
 Calculator already totally disassembled so what almost nothing more is the calculator 

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:29.670
 No longer used to correct or freeze 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:33.770
 This is a normal working Sa is no longer possible so the usual case 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:37.409
 and if you already have so many viruses on your hard drive 

00:00:37.409 --> 00:00:40.409
 these are the ones that used to start falling over each other 

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.640
 in another video myself as the DM recently showed you like one of them 

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.610
 windows-pc means to access reforms 10 on a colorful picture c 

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:53.789
 if that's going too fast for him now, or she's getting some points of it 

00:00:53.789 --> 00:00:56.999
 shown here can not understand exactly then just that 

00:00:56.999 --> 00:00:59.109
 Watch the video again briefly 

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:01.469
 most of it overlaps with this video 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:04.469
 so that I no longer show this here in full length 

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:09.340
 Now, although the DB has a Windows-pc but the want to help 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:10.730
 he did not work anymore 

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:14.180
 "If he has the one now there is a Ubuntu live cd then we can get him 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.300
 help anyway because in principle he has then again a Ubuntu district and we 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:20.360
 can help in the same way 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.200
 these examples just let me see this Windows 7 PC 

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.350
 the Ubuntu CD is in the drive in it normally so it can not now 

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:30.950
 not state more where you show very briefly that basically see 

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.670
 So an Ubuntu PC is state of the march on the fast new 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.780
 is assigned so selected 

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:49.110
 German language Ubuntu to try and calculate does not change 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.960
 After live-cd has started, you just click on systems again 

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.300
 settings 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.870
 remote screens 

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:06.740
 we set the clearance we will be clear about the security of what I want 

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.769
 In this example I would do that now 

00:02:09.769 --> 00:02:14.090
 that will not be asked for a password, the help should be direct 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.419
 can access it 

00:02:16.419 --> 00:02:19.559
 so many who do not want to access my computer after anyway 

00:02:19.559 --> 00:02:22.639
 no longer starts such commission as a pianist shows 

00:02:23.839 --> 00:02:27.079
 Of course, in this video of the Alpini comes a very special 

00:02:27.079 --> 00:02:29.900
 Meaning to because we also have to make sure that a beep 

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.939
 on Monday Shrek dash were let through 

00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:35.589
 Of course, special problems can arise from them 

00:02:35.589 --> 00:02:38.819
 possibly such a forwarding at her router alarm shot fashionable 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:42.719
 have set up, however, that this course is geared up 

00:02:42.719 --> 00:02:43.759
 the Alpine 

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:46.209
 usually from her 

00:02:46.209 --> 00:02:50.819
 Windows 7 PC or a windows pc so the PC does not want anymore and I voted 

00:02:51.689 --> 00:02:55.379
 ours is used and if you use a dhcp server then it can 

00:02:55.379 --> 00:02:56.519
 be quite 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:00.329
 if 1 of them assigns a peak to another, that may be 

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:03.439
 a little tri g you have to help him with the help of them 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:05.080
 that should be possible 

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.820
 to be quite able to do so 

00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:10.269
 in the worst case, there must be a fixed Albi 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:14.459
 in the hope that the Windows 7 PC has a fixed Alpi if 

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:15.569
 it does not and so will 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:16.660
 then just 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:18.679
 via the web browser 

00:03:18.679 --> 00:03:22.759
 on the router terrible ground grab and forwarding 

00:03:22.759 --> 00:03:26.220
 lying down according to ground is not easy for one 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:27.609
 whom they want to help 

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:28.539
 Indeed 

00:03:28.539 --> 00:03:31.489
 with expert guidance that should work well 

00:03:31.489 --> 00:03:33.280
 so if we assume that the 

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.730
 Redirection should relate to new forwarding facilities 

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:36.859
 had worked 

00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:40.430
 then, of course, here in this case just like in the other video the 

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:43.489
 windows-pc start its reform goal 

00:03:45.779 --> 00:03:50.290
 the corresponding one key specify the aesthetic reasons therefore 22 131 

00:03:51.939 --> 00:03:55.299
 22 Customers SEC 

00:03:55.299 --> 00:03:59.179
 click ok and get a screen accordingly 

00:03:59.759 --> 00:04:01.179
 appropriate 

00:04:01.179 --> 00:04:05.029
 on the Windows 7 PC accomplice a message that others are sitting all this 

00:04:05.029 --> 00:04:08.029
 Computer controls 

00:04:08.789 --> 00:04:11.789
 under Windows PC then is quite normal on places 

00:04:13.259 --> 00:04:16.079
 File system 

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:20.739
 Red Devils 4 the corresponding parts of Windows 7 and then it's their beginning 

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:23.439
 the corresponding 

00:04:23.439 --> 00:04:26.689
 Perform actions so relatively simple 

00:04:26.689 --> 00:04:29.759
 Of course they have one and Bodo live cd 

00:04:29.759 --> 00:04:32.849
 which should now if you have videos from sites like the DG 

00:04:32.849 --> 00:04:37.369
 Everyone has seen with his windows-pc and Tourette 

00:04:37.369 --> 00:04:38.139
 the how to live
