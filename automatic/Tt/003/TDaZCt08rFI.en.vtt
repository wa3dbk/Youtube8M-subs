even better picture quality in the
smaller<00:01:25.300> it's<00:01:26.289> still<00:01:26.680> a<00:01:26.710> huge<00:01:27.190> screen<00:01:28.979> the

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:29.979 
smaller it's still a huge screen the

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:32.669

power<00:01:30.280> behind<00:01:30.610> Samsung's<00:01:31.240> UHD<00:01:31.810> technology<00:01:32.440> is

00:01:32.669 --> 00:01:32.679 
power behind Samsung's UHD technology is

00:01:32.679 --> 00:01:35.160 
power behind Samsung's UHD technology is
a<00:01:32.710> quadratic<00:01:33.280> picture<00:01:33.729> engine<00:01:34.060> a<00:01:34.210> quad<00:01:34.960> core

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:35.170 
a quadratic picture engine a quad core

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:37.800 
a quadratic picture engine a quad core
processor<00:01:35.460> processes<00:01:36.460> video<00:01:36.759> 4<00:01:37.149> times<00:01:37.420> as<00:01:37.600> big

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:37.810 
processor processes video 4 times as big

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:38.730 
processor processes video 4 times as big
as<00:01:37.929> Full<00:01:38.110> HD

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:38.740 
as Full HD

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:43.050 
as Full HD
hence<00:01:39.030> 4k<00:01:40.030> it<00:01:40.869> also<00:01:41.050> has<00:01:41.350> a<00:01:41.380> four<00:01:41.800> step<00:01:42.190> scaling

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 
hence 4k it also has a four step scaling

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.279 
hence 4k it also has a four step scaling
process<00:01:43.539> so<00:01:44.020> you<00:01:44.110> can<00:01:44.170> upscale<00:01:44.920> Full<00:01:45.700> HD<00:01:46.289> HD

00:01:47.279 --> 00:01:47.289 
process so you can upscale Full HD HD

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:51.300 
process so you can upscale Full HD HD
and<00:01:47.590> even<00:01:48.069> SD<00:01:48.670> into<00:01:49.569> UHD<00:01:50.110> and<00:01:50.890> that's<00:01:51.130> pretty

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:51.310 
and even SD into UHD and that's pretty

00:01:51.310 --> 00:02:00.690 
and even SD into UHD and that's pretty
amazing<00:01:57.690> old<00:01:58.690> TVs<00:01:59.110> were<00:01:59.259> fat<00:01:59.619> and<00:01:59.950> now<00:02:00.489> they're
