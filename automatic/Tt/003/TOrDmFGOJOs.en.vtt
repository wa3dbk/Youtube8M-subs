00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.750
 so it's champions league time and that 

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:09.719
 Tuesday means the thirtieth fourth 

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:10.559
 the day before the first may before the day 

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.559
 the German 

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:15.210
 the full day of work so and that has 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.650
 the game we want to look at 

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:21.000
 the semifinal return match between the 

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:22.920
 Spanish master of the last German 

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.490
 most recent song so real madrid 

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:29.539
 against borussia dortmund offense 20 45 im 

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:32.880
 santiago bernabeu stadium of madrid and 

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:35.010
 the game of chance 4 1 for borussia dortmund 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:36.300
 So a clear box and there 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:39.270
 mounted therefore already with more 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.770
 as only one leg in the finale where she yes 

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:42.739
 maybe meet the bavaria 

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:45.600
 we will see then 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:48.270
 Let's take a look at the last games 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:50.100
 So 4 1 the borusses won that 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:52.890
 hinspiel then before the 2 2 in the 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.860
 group stage in santiago bernabeu and 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.170
 before that the 2 1 in signal iduna park that 

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.910
 means from the last three 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:01.350
 clash of these two teams 

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.470
 could the borussia 2 for themselves 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:06.840
 decide in a tie like that 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:09.840
 that's why last performance 71 percent 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:11.070
 at real madrid there were from the last 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:11.939
 seven play five wins two 

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.580
 defeats 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.840
 he lost both games in the game 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.000
 champions league can be said against 

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.590
 dortmund 4 1 and the return match against 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.750
 galatasaray where you go 

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:23.520
 probably not with the 

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:28.259
 necessary concentration to works gone 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:29.869
 is dortmund, however, six wins on 

00:01:28.259 --> 00:01:32.030
 piece 

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:34.950
 two of them from the challenge league and 

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:35.729
 a draw that was me 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.040
 can remember 

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:42.360
 the match in the champions league 

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:44.970
 quarterfinal against malaga law text 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:46.860
 duel of these two teams two victories 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:49.860
 two draws two victories for the 

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:52.439
 but borussen last but the power 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:57.000
 rather in the direction of borussia 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:58.350
 dortmund we'll see if the best 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.500
 scorers of both teams there we see 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:04.560
 cristiano ronaldo 12 hits benzema 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.810
 four caledon 2 marcelo and evil each 

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.060
 a hit 

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:12.540
 at the dortmundern lewandowski 10 reus 

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:16.000
 4 götze 2 santana 2 and fast 

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:18.190
 Now the question arises whether Ronaldo 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.250
 he was injured and was fit again 

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:25.000
 also I believe in derby last against 

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:26.379
 Atletico Madrid spared at the real game 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.959
 yes, a bit dependent on 

00:02:26.379 --> 00:02:30.069
 her superstar cristiano ronaldo 

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:31.720
 but also the game of dortmund 

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:32.920
 of course dependent on lewandowski edf 

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.370
 all for all four hits 

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:38.890
 scored in the match and the 

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:41.580
 rumors about the players of 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:47.620
 borussia dortmund also do not tear off 

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:49.930
 after the change of götze already 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:53.230
 became known in the direction of Bavaria 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.760
 then of course there are new rumors 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:57.160
 changes lewandowski yet to bayern 

00:02:54.760 --> 00:03:00.310
 hummels goes to barcelona and so on 

00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:01.780
 On and on, so there you find it 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.610
 the club does not come to the correct 

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.500
 Quiet 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:06.040
 the trees go to dortmund and so on 

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:09.129
 and so on 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:12.430
 or maybe gomez does not know 

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:14.019
 and well, of course you have the 

00:03:12.430 --> 00:03:17.079
 super starting position from the backlash 

00:03:14.019 --> 00:03:19.000
 and does not need it there now 

00:03:17.079 --> 00:03:21.340
 crazy about that 

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.019
 wirt transfer is the e through and he 

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:24.579
 should he be times but try 

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:25.720
 Last games are still good to deny 

00:03:24.579 --> 00:03:27.849
 for the big ones and maybe with you 

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.120
 to win a champions league 

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:30.120
 saying goodbye 

00:03:30.239 --> 00:03:35.349
 yes, so now for the conclusion of mine 

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:38.500
 tip for this game 

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:39.849
 I think it should be for the 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.139
 borussians may be enough, too 

00:03:39.849 --> 00:03:42.130
 now real madrid again everything 

00:03:41.139 --> 00:03:44.650
 I will think they will try 

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:48.340
 still hold and therefore mine 

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:51.099
 tip in the return match of the champions league 

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:52.780
 in the semifinal 1 2 1 victory for Real Madrid 

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:53.829
 but you know that's not going to happen 

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:56.079
 and then we see 

00:03:53.829 --> 00:03:58.980
 German-German duel in the finale in 

00:03:56.079 --> 00:03:58.980
 Wembley Stadium
