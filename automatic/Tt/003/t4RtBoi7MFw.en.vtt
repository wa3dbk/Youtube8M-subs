00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:09.250
 pollute 

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:16.080
 in matters of health constantly 

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:19.170
 we live listening to this or that flesh 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:23.619
 does damage that has effects on 

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:26.189
 harmful to humans there are several 

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:29.650
 studies that are confirming that the 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:32.020
 red meat is harmful to health I do not 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:35.050
 do that not this sustained development 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:37.420
 I swim but it's not me, let's hear what 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:40.620
 that says ladies away is a study 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.620
 several studies let's see 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.970
 that red meat is not exactly 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:49.440
 allied to health is no secret 

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:51.720
 Several studies have warned of the risk 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:54.140
 of cancer and other associated diseases 

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:56.610
 to a high consumption of this food 

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:58.470
 now a large sample of Europeans 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.290
 further confirms the additional risk 

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:03.570
 derived from processed meats the 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:04.890
 bmc medicine magazine publishes the 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.170
 half a million results 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:10.110
 individuals whose diet has been evaluated at 

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.920
 for years his conclusions in 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.780
 those who have also participated 

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.360
 researchers from various institutions 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:16.970
 Spanish experts warn that people 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.350
 with higher consumption of processed meats 

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:22.500
 have a higher risk of cancer and 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:23.970
 heart problems the work indicates 

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.070
 that foods like salami 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.899
 sausages and other types prepared from 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:29.910
 industrial meats such as 

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:32.369
 hamburgers meatballs or lasagna 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:33.630
 precooked for example are associated with 

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:35.750
 increased risk of disease 

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.100
 cardiovascular and cancer 

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.960
 curiously the pique study did not observe 

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:42.509
 the same risk derived from the consumption of 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.009
 red meat something that for example if it 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.080
 I had observed in investigations 

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:48.300
 similar Americans 

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:50.700
 doctor carlos gonzÃ¡lez coordinator of the 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:52.130
 Spanish branch of the pick clarifies that this 

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:54.780
 it is due to methodological differences 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:57.270
 because the study refers to cancer in 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.800
 general and not only to tumors in 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.350
 that the role of diet is fine 

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:03.510
 known the relationship of red meat 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.450
 with tumors of the stomach esophagus stomach 

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:08.340
 the added problem is well demonstrated 

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.140
 of meat preparations such as 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:12.210
 sausages is that they contain older 

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.550
 levels of fatty acids and cholesterol 

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:17.250
 that natural meat these foods 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:19.530
 They are also rich in fat and contain 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:21.570
 high levels of salt that are added 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:23.940
 during the processing to increase its 

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:25.770
 durability the heart is not the only 

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.050
 organ affected by high consumption 

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:30.420
 of salt according to several studies published 

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:31.800
 independent from the magazine nature this 

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.570
 seasoning could also be 

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.730
 responsible for the increase they have 

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:38.910
 experienced in recent years 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:42.830
