 second game wins second while she 

00:03:54.690 --> 00:04:02.940
 also boundaries while there is a game you read 

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:08.060
 the rules of the game there explains all these 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:11.960
 this is what victory is not out of the shaft 2 to 27 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:14.880
 equipping them every division 

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:17.160
 What does she read carefully? 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:20.150
 you will get no questions later 

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:22.250
 why I lost because I didn't know 

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:28.820
 on ignorance 

00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:32.010
 you yourself know what your problems are 

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:37.740
 study the rules carefully for the future 

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:49.790
 you will click as the seeds do not look 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:49.790
 what happens after 40 40 vogal 1 

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:56.430
 we would now 

00:04:52.030 --> 00:05:07.180
 on to 2 then it will be 1 more 

00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:11.850
 the desire to catch up on football a lot 

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:14.890
 different to go out of the wand 

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:16.770
 here express and read too what is 

00:05:14.890 --> 00:05:20.880
 express express then choose 

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:23.080
 one row different games 

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:26.080
 their coefficient is not multiplied 

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:28.980
 bad profit center fails 

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:31.740
 but if one crashes out of it 

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:34.740
 train 

00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:38.050
 will not play in any way means lost the whole 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:43.150
 so I advise you to play in single 

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:54.670
 footsteps like this and online so 

00:05:43.150 --> 00:06:01.240
 more interesting backdrop gives us alien so we 

00:05:54.670 --> 00:06:05.110
 lost we lost yes I put it 

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:09.910
 never chase big ones 

00:06:05.110 --> 00:06:18.010
 percent as they are not always 

00:06:09.910 --> 00:06:21.700
 shot at the center probably 90 they are not 

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:26.560
 shoot out so be born to choose with 

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:30.010
 cold try to choose small 

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:33.190
 the ratio is really that you will 

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:37.930
 play I just gave an example to you 

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:43.180
 showed that you can put so 

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:50.040
 so insert see not cardonia 9 for 

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:54.660
 great interest on better choose 

00:06:50.040 --> 00:07:01.110
 1516 1311 even very good tits and 

00:06:54.660 --> 00:07:05.130
 ass 1000 earn 100 for 

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:05.130
 so choose 

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:13.260
 choose coefficients less than function 

00:07:08.910 --> 00:07:20.110
 large academy coefficient is better 

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:24.640
 tit in so play try everything 

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:29.230
 you will succeed I did not even win the thread 

00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:32.530
 not to say that he won for not 

00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:35.320
 Affairs specifically not because I set 

00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:37.090
 a set of large inserts a little 

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:40.770
 lucky so this is you never know 

00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:42.970
 lucky never think with your head and 

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:47.500
 again repeat choose 

00:07:42.970 --> 00:07:49.440
 the stakes from the shops are so valuable 

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:53.260
 small 

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:55.480
 on big recipes that's too if you're there 

00:07:53.260 --> 00:08:00.790
 somehow already see and feel all day 

00:07:55.480 --> 00:08:06.210
 or data to take my advisor on this 

00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:06.210
 good luck come in new good bye
