review of the RC mixed kernel which I

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.639 
review of the RC mixed kernel which I

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
want I was only is supposed to be able

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.429 
want I was only is supposed to be able
to<00:01:43.799> go<00:01:43.920> to<00:01:43.979> almost<00:01:44.610> 2<00:01:44.820> gigahertz<00:01:45.180> but<00:01:45.600> I<00:01:45.780> could

00:01:46.429 --> 00:01:46.439 
to go to almost 2 gigahertz but I could

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:50.929 
to go to almost 2 gigahertz but I could
only<00:01:46.560> get<00:01:47.189> it<00:01:47.340> to<00:01:47.549> actually<00:01:48.030> go<00:01:48.240> up<00:01:48.380> to<00:01:49.380> 1.5<00:01:50.070> 16

00:01:50.929 --> 00:01:50.939 
only get it to actually go up to 1.5 16

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:53.420 
only get it to actually go up to 1.5 16
gigahertz<00:01:51.329> but<00:01:52.229> hopefully<00:01:52.560> this<00:01:53.040> one<00:01:53.280> is<00:01:53.399> a

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
gigahertz but hopefully this one is a

00:01:53.430 --> 00:02:03.520 
gigahertz but hopefully this one is a
lot<00:01:53.610> faster<00:01:53.909> and

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:03.530 

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.400

booted up online mcdeere on three iran
and<00:02:37.830> let's<00:02:38.370> go<00:02:38.550> overclock<00:02:39.150> it<00:02:39.180> I've<00:02:39.780> got<00:02:40.260> the

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:40.470 
and let's go overclock it I've got the

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.560 
and let's go overclock it I've got the
setcpu<00:02:40.890> app<00:02:41.370> install<00:02:41.820> if<00:02:41.970> you<00:02:42.060> don't<00:02:42.240> have<00:02:42.420> it

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:42.570 
setcpu app install if you don't have it

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:46.400 
setcpu app install if you don't have it
you<00:02:42.720> can<00:02:43.530> download<00:02:43.860> it<00:02:44.070> off<00:02:44.910> the<00:02:45.390> setcpu<00:02:45.870> site

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:46.410 
you can download it off the setcpu site

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.880 
you can download it off the setcpu site
for<00:02:47.010> free<00:02:47.190> or<00:02:47.610> you<00:02:47.640> can<00:02:47.880> buy<00:02:48.000> it<00:02:48.060> on<00:02:48.180> the<00:02:48.210> market

I'm just install it so I'm going to run

00:02:52.860 --> 00:03:02.420 
I'm just install it so I'm going to run
my<00:02:53.010> setcpu<00:02:53.459> app<00:02:54.050> and<00:02:57.530> so<00:02:58.530> now<00:02:58.680> I<00:02:58.709> can<00:02:58.890> go<00:03:01.430> 1.72

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:02.430 
my setcpu app and so now I can go 1.72

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:03.949 
my setcpu app and so now I can go 1.72
and<00:03:02.670> if<00:03:02.970> you<00:03:03.090> want<00:03:03.270> to<00:03:03.330> test<00:03:03.480> out<00:03:03.690> if<00:03:03.810> it's

00:03:03.949 --> 00:03:03.959 
and if you want to test out if it's

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:06.590 
and if you want to test out if it's
actually<00:03:04.080> going<00:03:04.410> put<00:03:04.800> on<00:03:04.890> performance<00:03:05.600> there

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:06.600 
actually going put on performance there

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.979 
actually going put on performance there
I've<00:03:06.900> got<00:03:07.260> it<00:03:07.380> to<00:03:07.650> 1.7<00:03:08.489> to<00:03:08.610> edit<00:03:08.989> gigahertz

total<00:03:19.140> right<00:03:19.769> and<00:03:20.610> let<00:03:20.820> me<00:03:20.910> run<00:03:21.269> linpack<00:03:21.750> I<00:03:22.050> was

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:22.980 
total right and let me run linpack I was

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:26.990 
total right and let me run linpack I was
getting<00:03:23.250> at<00:03:23.370> 1.5<00:03:23.940> 16<00:03:24.480> with<00:03:24.750> the<00:03:25.019> other<00:03:25.700> RC<00:03:26.700> mix

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:27.000 
getting at 1.5 16 with the other RC mix

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.310 
getting at 1.5 16 with the other RC mix
Colonel<00:03:27.450> I<00:03:27.510> was<00:03:27.630> getting<00:03:27.870> about<00:03:29.720> 80<00:03:30.720> I<00:03:31.019> think

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:31.320 
Colonel I was getting about 80 I think

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:34.550 
Colonel I was getting about 80 I think
near<00:03:31.830> 80<00:03:32.040> um<00:03:32.660> but<00:03:33.660> let's<00:03:33.930> see<00:03:34.140> if<00:03:34.200> we<00:03:34.350> can<00:03:34.440> go

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:34.560 
near 80 um but let's see if we can go

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.520 
near 80 um but let's see if we can go
higher<00:03:34.800> I<00:03:35.720> don't<00:03:36.720> have<00:03:36.780> anything<00:03:36.989> sinking

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530 
higher I don't have anything sinking

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.940 
higher I don't have anything sinking
yeah<00:03:37.800> it's<00:03:38.070> much<00:03:38.280> higher<00:03:38.459> 86<00:03:39.830> hopefully<00:03:40.830> I<00:03:40.860> can

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
yeah it's much higher 86 hopefully I can

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:49.370 
yeah it's much higher 86 hopefully I can
get<00:03:41.160> go<00:03:41.459> above<00:03:41.730> 85<00:03:44.510> 85<00:03:47.780> okay<00:03:48.780> it's<00:03:48.959> not<00:03:49.050> too<00:03:49.230> bad

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:49.380 
get go above 85 85 okay it's not too bad

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:52.160 
get go above 85 85 okay it's not too bad
I'm<00:03:49.709> expecting<00:03:50.550> like<00:03:50.670> even<00:03:50.970> more<00:03:51.239> you<00:03:51.810> know<00:03:51.900> I

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:52.170 
I'm expecting like even more you know I

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.800 
I'm expecting like even more you know I
know<00:03:52.410> I'm<00:03:52.650> just<00:03:52.860> I<00:03:53.130> want<00:03:54.060> to<00:03:54.120> get<00:03:54.209> it<00:03:54.330> near<00:03:54.630> like

00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:54.810 
know I'm just I want to get it near like

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.050 
know I'm just I want to get it near like
200<00:03:55.620> or<00:03:55.739> something<00:03:56.190> that<00:03:56.610> would<00:03:56.730> be<00:03:56.910> really

00:03:57.050 --> 00:03:57.060 
200 or something that would be really

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:00.560 
200 or something that would be really
cool<00:03:57.709> so<00:03:58.709> i<00:03:58.739> got<00:03:58.950> like<00:03:59.100> 83<00:03:59.610> it's<00:03:59.970> a<00:04:00.180> little<00:04:00.450> bit

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:04.080 
faster i guess and then let me test out

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.500 
faster i guess and then let me test out
quadrant<00:04:05.010> for<00:04:05.220> you<00:04:05.340> real<00:04:05.640> quick<00:04:05.670> now<00:04:06.420> i'm
