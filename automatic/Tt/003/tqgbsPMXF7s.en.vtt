00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:05.120 
them together so that's a helpful way to
work<00:02:02.579> that<00:02:03.140> that<00:02:04.140> one<00:02:04.350> tends<00:02:04.649> to<00:02:04.920> leave<00:02:05.100> a

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:05.130 
work that that one tends to leave a

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.960 
work that that one tends to leave a
little<00:02:05.369> bit<00:02:05.549> more<00:02:05.610> of<00:02:05.939> a<00:02:06.060> loop<00:02:06.270> on<00:02:06.450> the<00:02:06.600> back

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
little bit more of a loop on the back

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.050 
little bit more of a loop on the back
so<00:02:07.210> it's<00:02:07.390> not<00:02:07.570> quite<00:02:08.020> as<00:02:08.229> nice<00:02:08.410> but<00:02:08.940> if<00:02:09.940> you

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
so it's not quite as nice but if you

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.210 
so it's not quite as nice but if you
have<00:02:10.210> trouble<00:02:10.330> pulling<00:02:10.780> it<00:02:10.899> through<00:02:11.040> if<00:02:12.040> you

00:02:12.210 --> 00:02:12.220 
have trouble pulling it through if you

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.700 
have trouble pulling it through if you
ever<00:02:12.460> have<00:02:13.270> to<00:02:13.450> undo<00:02:13.840> it<00:02:13.990> and<00:02:14.110> you<00:02:14.260> see<00:02:14.470> here
