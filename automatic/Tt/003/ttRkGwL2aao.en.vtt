00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:10.200 
Timmons listen is played in the key of C

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.879 
Timmons listen is played in the key of C
major<00:00:10.469> where<00:00:11.219> every<00:00:11.969> single<00:00:12.929> key<00:00:13.139> is<00:00:13.349> natural

00:00:13.879 --> 00:00:13.889 
major where every single key is natural

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.800 
major where every single key is natural
so<00:00:14.700> the<00:00:15.690> key<00:00:15.870> of<00:00:15.960> C<00:00:16.109> major<00:00:16.139> star<00:00:16.740> to<00:00:16.949> see<00:00:17.810> then

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:18.810 
so the key of C major star to see then

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:28.759 
so the key of C major star to see then
we<00:00:18.960> have<00:00:19.080> d<00:00:19.320> e<00:00:19.529> f<00:00:20.689> g<00:00:21.830> a<00:00:23.300> b<00:00:24.590> and<00:00:25.590> c<00:00:27.380> so<00:00:28.380> the<00:00:28.590> sun

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
we have d e f g a b and c so the sun

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.540 
we have d e f g a b and c so the sun
starts<00:00:29.220> with<00:00:30.029> a<00:00:30.060> verse<00:00:30.359> in<00:00:31.009> the<00:00:32.009> verse<00:00:32.309> we

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:32.550 
starts with a verse in the verse we

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:38.959 
starts with a verse in the verse we
start<00:00:32.850> with<00:00:33.000> C<00:00:33.270> major<00:00:33.450> chord<00:00:37.760> then<00:00:38.760> we're

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
start with C major chord then we're

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:51.850 
start with C major chord then we're
going<00:00:39.149> to<00:00:39.270> a<00:00:39.739> minor<00:00:43.489> we<00:00:44.489> go<00:00:44.670> to<00:00:44.820> death<00:00:45.030> later<00:00:50.300> so

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:51.860 
going to a minor we go to death later so

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:56.119 
going to a minor we go to death later so
let's<00:00:52.860> see<00:00:53.070> how<00:00:53.100> is<00:00:53.460> the<00:00:53.610> C<00:00:54.000> major<00:00:54.180> chord<00:00:55.129> here

00:00:56.119 --> 00:00:56.129 
let's see how is the C major chord here

00:00:56.129 --> 00:00:59.060 
let's see how is the C major chord here
left<00:00:56.520> hand<00:00:56.820> we<00:00:57.239> have<00:00:57.270> 6<00:00:57.960> e<00:00:58.320> and<00:00:58.530> on<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:58.859> right

when<00:01:11.640> French<00:01:12.299> both<00:01:12.510> hands<00:01:12.780> is<00:01:13.020> one<00:01:13.260> and<00:01:14.010> then

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
when French both hands is one and then

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:17.749 
when French both hands is one and then
the<00:01:14.340> right<00:01:14.490> hand<00:01:14.520> two<00:01:15.150> three<00:01:15.900> four<00:01:16.740> and<00:01:17.070> get

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
the right hand two three four and get

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:18.550 
the right hand two three four and get
one

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560 
one

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:28.720 
one
2<00:01:18.680> 3<00:01:19.430> 4<00:01:20.149> to<00:01:20.930> the<00:01:21.079> sewage<00:01:21.380> have<00:01:21.619> an<00:01:21.740> in<00:01:21.860> C<00:01:22.159> major

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:28.730 

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:32.620 

then<00:01:29.300> we<00:01:29.420> go<00:01:29.570> to<00:01:29.600> a<00:01:29.870> mile<00:01:30.730> to<00:01:31.730> a<00:01:31.970> minor<00:01:32.270> we<00:01:32.570> do

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:32.630 
then we go to a mile to a minor we do

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.080 
then we go to a mile to a minor we do
exactly<00:01:33.020> the<00:01:33.230> same<00:01:33.260> thing<00:01:33.470> we<00:01:34.220> press<00:01:34.520> both

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:35.090 
exactly the same thing we press both

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.080 
exactly the same thing we press both
hands<00:01:35.600> and<00:01:35.990> then<00:01:36.560> we<00:01:36.710> keep<00:01:36.920> moving<00:01:37.160> the<00:01:37.880> right

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 
hands and then we keep moving the right

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.450 
hands and then we keep moving the right
hand<00:01:38.390> up<00:01:38.510> and<00:01:38.630> down<00:01:38.720> now<00:01:39.530> the<00:01:39.860> left<00:01:40.040> hand<00:01:40.130> we

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
hand up and down now the left hand we

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:42.790 
hand up and down now the left hand we
have<00:01:40.640> our<00:01:40.970> left<00:01:41.270> hands<00:01:41.480> ache<00:01:41.720> and<00:01:42.230> II<00:01:42.380> and

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:42.800 
have our left hands ache and II and

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:49.240 
have our left hands ache and II and
arrive<00:01:43.310> is<00:01:43.580> a<00:01:43.760> SI<00:01:44.720> e<00:01:46.270> we<00:01:47.270> press<00:01:47.540> it<00:01:47.690> all<00:01:47.900> is<00:01:48.860> one

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:49.250 
arrive is a SI e we press it all is one

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:54.760 
arrive is a SI e we press it all is one
another<00:01:49.820> I<00:01:49.970> found<00:01:50.360> two<00:01:50.810> three<00:01:51.650> four<00:01:52.400> one<00:01:53.770> three

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:54.770 
another I found two three four one three

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.780 
another I found two three four one three
four<00:01:56.200> so<00:01:57.200> this<00:01:57.380> is<00:01:57.410> what's<00:01:57.620> happening<00:01:57.710> a<00:01:58.310> minor

00:01:58.780 --> 00:01:58.790 
four so this is what's happening a minor

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:03.970 
four so this is what's happening a minor
and<00:01:59.150> then<00:01:59.540> we<00:01:59.660> go<00:01:59.810> to<00:01:59.840> F<00:02:00.170> major<00:02:02.560> we<00:02:03.560> do<00:02:03.710> exactly

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:03.980 
and then we go to F major we do exactly

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:08.230 
and then we go to F major we do exactly
the<00:02:04.220> same<00:02:04.250> thing<00:02:05.050> we<00:02:06.050> start<00:02:06.410> by<00:02:07.190> pressing<00:02:07.490> both

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:08.240 
the same thing we start by pressing both

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:14.700 
the same thing we start by pressing both
hands<00:02:08.649> left<00:02:09.649> hand<00:02:09.950> is<00:02:10.100> FF<00:02:10.910> the<00:02:11.840> right<00:02:12.050> is<00:02:12.290> a<00:02:12.700> C<00:02:13.700> F

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:14.710 
hands left hand is FF the right is a C F

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:18.400 
hands left hand is FF the right is a C F
we<00:02:15.710> brush<00:02:15.980> it<00:02:16.100> all<00:02:16.660> keep<00:02:17.660> moving<00:02:18.020> right<00:02:18.170> hand

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:18.410 
we brush it all keep moving right hand

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.460 
we brush it all keep moving right hand
up<00:02:18.500> and<00:02:18.620> down<00:02:18.710> two<00:02:19.280> three<00:02:19.970> four<00:02:20.780> and<00:02:21.080> then

00:02:21.460 --> 00:02:21.470 
up and down two three four and then

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:26.140 
up and down two three four and then

we<00:05:55.419> gotta<00:05:55.629> g<00:05:55.960> 1<00:05:56.319> 2<00:05:56.949> 3<00:05:57.430> 4<00:05:57.669> in<00:05:58.360> this<00:05:58.990> G<00:05:59.319> how<00:06:00.189> we<00:06:00.249> can

00:06:00.659 --> 00:06:00.669 
we gotta g 1 2 3 4 in this G how we can

00:06:00.669 --> 00:06:05.549 
we gotta g 1 2 3 4 in this G how we can
play<00:06:01.330> GG<00:06:01.930> left<00:06:02.680> hand<00:06:02.949> before<00:06:03.219> he<00:06:03.610> was<00:06:03.879> GD<00:06:04.559> the

play GG left hand before he was GD the

00:06:05.559 --> 00:06:11.519 
play GG left hand before he was GD the
only<00:06:06.189> another<00:06:06.939> difference<00:06:07.619> in<00:06:08.619> G<00:06:09.149> major<00:06:10.349> so<00:06:11.349> we

00:06:11.519 --> 00:06:11.529 
only another difference in G major so we

00:06:11.529 --> 00:06:19.679 
only another difference in G major so we
start<00:06:11.800> with<00:06:11.860> a<00:06:14.219> plain<00:06:15.219> f<00:06:16.409> they<00:06:17.409> see<00:06:18.210> them<00:06:19.210> play

00:06:19.679 --> 00:06:19.689 
start with a plain f they see them play

00:06:19.689 --> 00:06:21.470 
start with a plain f they see them play
G

00:06:21.470 --> 00:06:21.480 
G

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:32.019 
G
do<00:06:21.690> that<00:06:21.870> one<00:06:22.050> more<00:06:22.110> time

00:06:32.019 --> 00:06:32.029 

00:06:32.029 --> 00:06:36.949 

and<00:06:33.110> then<00:06:34.110> at<00:06:34.229> the<00:06:34.349> end<00:06:34.379> of<00:06:34.559> the<00:06:34.879> the<00:06:35.879> course<00:06:36.179> we

00:06:36.949 --> 00:06:36.959 
and then at the end of the the course we

00:06:36.959 --> 00:06:44.969 
and then at the end of the the course we
play<00:06:37.229> that<00:06:37.499> softer<00:06:38.749> g3

00:06:44.969 --> 00:06:44.979 

00:06:44.979 --> 00:06:50.050
