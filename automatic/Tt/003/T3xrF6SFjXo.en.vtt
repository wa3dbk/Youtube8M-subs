all<00:03:53.540> from<00:03:53.720> the<00:03:53.780> G<00:03:53.959> sharp<00:03:54.190> 7<00:03:55.190> chord<00:03:55.430> right<00:03:55.580> here

00:03:56.009 --> 00:03:56.019 
all from the G sharp 7 chord right here

00:03:56.019 --> 00:04:04.500 
all from the G sharp 7 chord right here
so<00:03:57.019> real<00:03:57.230> slow<00:03:57.530> although<00:04:01.480> and<00:04:02.480> also<00:04:03.350> you<00:04:04.160> can

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:04.510 
so real slow although and also you can

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:07.180 
so real slow although and also you can
for<00:04:05.510> the<00:04:05.600> C<00:04:05.900> sharp<00:04:06.079> 7<00:04:06.440> chord<00:04:06.680> you<00:04:06.769> can<00:04:06.920> play<00:04:07.070> it

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:07.190 
for the C sharp 7 chord you can play it

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:12.970 
for the C sharp 7 chord you can play it
out<00:04:07.340> so<00:04:07.670> I'm<00:04:07.760> actually<00:04:07.910> playing<00:04:08.390> the<00:04:11.980> instead

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:12.980 
out so I'm actually playing the instead

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:16.870 
out so I'm actually playing the instead
of<00:04:13.040> playing<00:04:13.220> that<00:04:13.430> chord<00:04:13.820> you<00:04:14.060> can<00:04:14.120> also<00:04:15.880> roll

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:16.880 
of playing that chord you can also roll

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:19.120 
of playing that chord you can also roll
out<00:04:17.030> the<00:04:17.209> C<00:04:17.570> sharp<00:04:17.870> 7<00:04:18.560> chord<00:04:18.859> a<00:04:18.890> little<00:04:18.919> bit

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.130 
out the C sharp 7 chord a little bit

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:22.879 
out the C sharp 7 chord a little bit
longer

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:22.889 

00:04:22.889 --> 00:04:57.990 

and<00:04:23.099> then<00:04:23.729> roll<00:04:23.939> the<00:04:24.120> D<00:04:24.840> sharp<00:04:25.050> chord

00:04:57.990 --> 00:04:58.000 

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.640 

and<00:04:59.000> that's<00:04:59.660> the<00:04:59.840> foods<00:05:00.080> lesson

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:00.650 
and that's the foods lesson

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:02.020 
and that's the foods lesson
as<00:05:00.830> I<00:05:00.980> said<00:05:01.250> it's<00:05:01.430> fairly<00:05:01.730> straightforward

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:02.030 
as I said it's fairly straightforward

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:05.650 
as I said it's fairly straightforward
and<00:05:02.660> the<00:05:03.650> court<00:05:03.920> structure<00:05:04.370> is<00:05:04.730> fairly<00:05:05.180> fairly

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:05.660 
and the court structure is fairly fairly

00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:09.940 
and the court structure is fairly fairly
easy<00:05:06.440> to<00:05:06.650> get<00:05:07.000> it's<00:05:08.000> a<00:05:08.150> little<00:05:08.620> more<00:05:09.620> advanced

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:09.950 
easy to get it's a little more advanced

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:12.100 
easy to get it's a little more advanced
than<00:05:10.220> what<00:05:10.460> I'm<00:05:10.670> normally<00:05:11.240> used<00:05:11.600> to<00:05:11.660> teaching

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:12.110 
than what I'm normally used to teaching

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:16.420 
than what I'm normally used to teaching
and<00:05:13.090> I<00:05:14.090> think<00:05:14.870> it's<00:05:15.350> you'll<00:05:15.620> everyone<00:05:16.190> will<00:05:16.280> do

00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:16.430 
and I think it's you'll everyone will do

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:18.790 
and I think it's you'll everyone will do
fine<00:05:16.700> with<00:05:16.970> the<00:05:17.120> with<00:05:17.360> this<00:05:17.510> song<00:05:17.780> going<00:05:18.590> along

fine with the with this song going along

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.110

00:05:22.030 --> 00:05:22.040 
there's variations to the original song

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:25.120

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:28.760 
this is the the basic version that will
