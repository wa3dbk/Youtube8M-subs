00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:38.340 
part you're going to work your way

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:44.450 
part you're going to work your way
around<00:02:38.549> the<00:02:39.030> circle

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:44.460 

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:47.720 

and<00:02:45.300> after<00:02:46.200> you<00:02:46.290> masked<00:02:46.740> out<00:02:46.860> the<00:02:47.220> first

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:47.730 
and after you masked out the first

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.370 
and after you masked out the first
section<00:02:48.030> of<00:02:48.180> the<00:02:48.330> circle<00:02:48.630> we<00:02:48.870> want<00:02:49.020> to<00:02:49.110> do<00:02:49.230> it

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:49.380 
section of the circle we want to do it

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:59.040 
section of the circle we want to do it
for<00:02:51.020> this<00:02:52.020> part

00:02:59.040 --> 00:02:59.050 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:02.730 

and<00:02:59.440> doesn't<00:03:00.070> have<00:03:00.160> to<00:03:00.280> be<00:03:00.400> perfect<00:03:00.970> so<00:03:01.840> it<00:03:02.530> can

00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:02.740 
and doesn't have to be perfect so it can

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:06.800 
and doesn't have to be perfect so it can
be<00:03:02.890> a<00:03:02.920> little<00:03:03.190> messy<00:03:03.370> if<00:03:03.610> you<00:03:03.730> want<00:03:03.970> it<00:03:04.090> to<00:03:04.420> be

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:06.810 

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:10.590 

and<00:03:08.100> then<00:03:09.100> next<00:03:09.310> what<00:03:09.790> we<00:03:09.970> want<00:03:10.180> to<00:03:10.240> do<00:03:10.330> is<00:03:10.450> go

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:10.600 
and then next what we want to do is go

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.990 
and then next what we want to do is go
to<00:03:10.660> the<00:03:10.870> first<00:03:11.050> image<00:03:11.500> hover<00:03:12.340> your<00:03:12.610> cursor

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.000 
to the first image hover your cursor

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.840 
to the first image hover your cursor
over<00:03:13.030> the<00:03:13.480> top<00:03:14.050> left<00:03:14.290> corner<00:03:14.440> and<00:03:14.980> it's<00:03:15.820> a

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:15.850 
over the top left corner and it's a

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:19.590 
over the top left corner and it's a
little<00:03:15.910> icons<00:03:16.420> pop<00:03:16.750> up<00:03:17.820> fade<00:03:18.820> it<00:03:18.970> until<00:03:19.420> the

00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:19.600 
little icons pop up fade it until the

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:22.800 
little icons pop up fade it until the
second<00:03:19.990> image<00:03:20.200> starts<00:03:20.470> and<00:03:20.800> then<00:03:21.450> do<00:03:22.450> the<00:03:22.600> same

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810 
second image starts and then do the same

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:26.970 
second image starts and then do the same
thing<00:03:23.020> for<00:03:23.230> the<00:03:23.350> rest<00:03:23.680> of<00:03:23.860> the<00:03:23.980> images<00:03:25.830> now<00:03:26.830> if

00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:26.980 
thing for the rest of the images now if

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:30.060 
thing for the rest of the images now if
you<00:03:27.100> preview<00:03:28.030> the<00:03:28.210> video<00:03:28.680> it's<00:03:29.680> going<00:03:29.830> to<00:03:29.860> look

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.070 
you preview the video it's going to look

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:33.570 
you preview the video it's going to look
something<00:03:30.100> like<00:03:30.490> this<00:03:31.920> and<00:03:32.920> basically<00:03:33.160> we're

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:33.580 
something like this and basically we're

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:35.850 
something like this and basically we're
going<00:03:33.700> to<00:03:33.760> use<00:03:33.850> the<00:03:34.090> fade<00:03:34.390> offset<00:03:34.720> to<00:03:35.410> apply

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:35.860 
going to use the fade offset to apply

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:40.200 
going to use the fade offset to apply
the<00:03:35.920> transition<00:03:36.820> so<00:03:37.270> that<00:03:37.530> it<00:03:38.530> kind<00:03:39.070> of<00:03:39.210> slides

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:40.210 
the transition so that it kind of slides

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:42.840 
the transition so that it kind of slides
and<00:03:40.570> so<00:03:40.900> go<00:03:41.500> to<00:03:41.560> your<00:03:41.680> transitions<00:03:42.340> and<00:03:42.610> then

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:42.850 
and so go to your transitions and then

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:45.600 
and so go to your transitions and then
go<00:03:42.970> to<00:03:43.000> push<00:03:43.620> their<00:03:44.620> you<00:03:44.710> have<00:03:44.920> a<00:03:45.160> large

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:45.610 
go to push their you have a large

00:03:45.610 --> 00:03:50.580 
go to push their you have a large
variety<00:03:46.030> of<00:03:46.390> plugins<00:03:46.870> and<00:03:49.350> basically<00:03:50.350> you<00:03:50.470> can

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:50.590 
variety of plugins and basically you can

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:52.380 
variety of plugins and basically you can
select<00:03:50.920> any<00:03:51.040> of<00:03:51.250> the<00:03:51.310> plugins<00:03:51.700> and<00:03:51.940> apply<00:03:52.360> it

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:52.390 
select any of the plugins and apply it

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:59.740 
select any of the plugins and apply it
to<00:03:52.960> the<00:03:53.080> fade<00:03:53.470> offset

00:03:59.740 --> 00:03:59.750 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:02.830 

and<00:03:59.870> then<00:04:00.560> just<00:04:01.160> apply<00:04:01.340> different<00:04:02.120> presets<00:04:02.600> to

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:02.840 
and then just apply different presets to

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:07.650 
and then just apply different presets to
the<00:04:03.140> each<00:04:03.890> of<00:04:04.160> the<00:04:04.250> fade<00:04:04.460> offsets<00:04:04.940> and

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:07.660 

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:14.080 

basically<00:04:08.660> after<00:04:09.290> you<00:04:11.200> applied<00:04:12.200> to<00:04:13.090> every

00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:14.090 
basically after you applied to every

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:17.590 
basically after you applied to every
offset<00:04:14.630> of<00:04:15.500> each<00:04:15.950> image<00:04:16.220> it's<00:04:17.120> going<00:04:17.359> to<00:04:17.420> look

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:17.600 
offset of each image it's going to look

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:27.850 
offset of each image it's going to look
something<00:04:17.630> like<00:04:18.440> this<00:04:23.980> so<00:04:26.200> it's<00:04:27.200> preview<00:04:27.740> it

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:27.860 
something like this so it's preview it

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:34.870 
something like this so it's preview it
again<00:04:32.740> so<00:04:33.740> that's<00:04:33.980> how<00:04:34.070> you<00:04:34.160> do<00:04:34.310> the<00:04:34.430> puzzle

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:34.880 
again so that's how you do the puzzle

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:36.730 
again so that's how you do the puzzle
