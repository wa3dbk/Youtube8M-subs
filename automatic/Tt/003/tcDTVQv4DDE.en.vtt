00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
it up on the YouTube channel a non-tech

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.680 
it up on the YouTube channel a non-tech
stop<00:00:48.809> c.net<00:00:49.370> two-stage<00:00:50.370> into<00:00:50.760> that<00:00:50.940> right<00:00:51.629> now

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
stop c.net two-stage into that right now

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.790 
stop c.net two-stage into that right now
let's<00:00:52.260> get<00:00:52.440> into<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:52.710> unboxing<00:00:54.680> so<00:00:55.680> that's

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:55.800 
let's get into the unboxing so that's

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.520 
let's get into the unboxing so that's
the<00:00:55.920> box<00:00:56.370> of<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:56.730> ricoh<00:00:57.120> PX<00:00:57.570> as<00:00:57.840> you<00:00:58.050> can<00:00:58.230> see

00:00:58.520 --> 00:00:58.530 
the box of the ricoh PX as you can see

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:00.680 
the box of the ricoh PX as you can see
there<00:00:58.800> for<00:00:59.219> just<00:00:59.399> run<00:00:59.579> down<00:00:59.789> the<00:01:00.000> box<00:01:00.239> quickly

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690 
there for just run down the box quickly

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:03.170 
there for just run down the box quickly
thus<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.530> camera<00:01:01.859> does<00:01:02.010> have<00:01:02.219> a<00:01:02.250> 16<00:01:02.820> megapixel

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:03.180 
thus the camera does have a 16 megapixel

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.010 
thus the camera does have a 16 megapixel
ccd<00:01:04.220> sensor<00:01:05.220> which<00:01:05.729> is<00:01:05.880> very<00:01:06.150> big<00:01:06.450> considering

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
ccd sensor which is very big considering

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.039 
ccd sensor which is very big considering
the<00:01:07.140> small<00:01:07.439> size<00:01:07.740> of<00:01:07.979> the<00:01:08.430> ricoh<00:01:08.850> PX<00:01:09.330> so<00:01:09.900> let's

00:01:10.039 --> 00:01:10.049 
the small size of the ricoh PX so let's

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:11.960 
the small size of the ricoh PX so let's
hope<00:01:10.229> the<00:01:10.409> image<00:01:10.590> quality<00:01:10.770> is<00:01:10.979> also<00:01:11.520> up<00:01:11.760> to

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:11.970 
hope the image quality is also up to

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.510 
hope the image quality is also up to
