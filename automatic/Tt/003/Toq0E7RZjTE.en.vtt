bucket of lava and a bucket of water and
a<00:00:38.520> place<00:00:38.820> to<00:00:39.149> build<00:00:39.510> this<00:00:39.800> now<00:00:40.800> I<00:00:41.160> don't<00:00:41.460> know

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:41.640 
a place to build this now I don't know

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.790 
a place to build this now I don't know
if<00:00:41.760> this<00:00:41.969> has<00:00:42.149> been<00:00:42.390> discovered<00:00:42.870> before<00:00:43.110> but<00:00:43.649> I

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:43.800 
if this has been discovered before but I

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.760 
if this has been discovered before but I
just<00:00:44.239> discovered<00:00:45.239> it<00:00:45.390> on<00:00:45.539> accident<00:00:45.870> trying<00:00:46.680> to

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:46.770 
just discovered it on accident trying to

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.279 
just discovered it on accident trying to
do<00:00:46.890> something<00:00:47.160> else<00:00:47.399> and<00:00:47.760> actually<00:00:48.629> what<00:00:49.260> I

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
do something else and actually what I

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:51.170 
do something else and actually what I
did<00:00:49.440> on<00:00:49.860> my<00:00:49.890> other<00:00:50.250> world<00:00:50.610> with<00:00:50.879> it

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:51.180 
did on my other world with it

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:53.660 
did on my other world with it
as<00:00:51.239> I<00:00:51.539> put<00:00:51.989> in<00:00:52.110> pistons<00:00:52.800> so<00:00:53.190> it's<00:00:53.340> fully

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
as I put in pistons so it's fully

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.110 
as I put in pistons so it's fully
automatic<00:00:54.510> and<00:00:55.070> you<00:00:56.070> can<00:00:56.250> just<00:00:56.430> like<00:00:56.640> hold

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:57.120 
automatic and you can just like hold

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:59.930 
automatic and you can just like hold
down<00:00:57.390> the<00:00:57.570> mouse<00:00:57.690> key<00:00:58.050> and<00:00:58.260> collect<00:00:58.949> tons<00:00:59.340> but

00:00:59.930 --> 00:00:59.940 
down the mouse key and collect tons but

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.360 
down the mouse key and collect tons but
anyway<00:01:00.300> here's<00:01:00.600> how<00:01:00.719> to<00:01:00.780> make<00:01:01.079> it<00:01:01.260> so<00:01:02.039> you're

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
anyway here's how to make it so you're

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:07.550 
anyway here's how to make it so you're
gonna<00:01:02.520> dig<00:01:03.589> for<00:01:04.589> like<00:01:05.580> a<00:01:05.820> one<00:01:06.180> by<00:01:06.390> four<00:01:06.659> by<00:01:07.229> one

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:07.560 
gonna dig for like a one by four by one

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:12.950 
gonna dig for like a one by four by one
hole<00:01:07.920> and<00:01:08.820> then<00:01:09.920> you're<00:01:10.920> going<00:01:11.100> to<00:01:11.280> put<00:01:11.790> a<00:01:12.090> dirt

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
hole and then you're going to put a dirt

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.050 
hole and then you're going to put a dirt
block<00:01:13.260> kinda<00:01:14.040> like<00:01:14.189> this<00:01:14.369> doesn't<00:01:14.909> really

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:15.060 
block kinda like this doesn't really

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.240 
block kinda like this doesn't really
matter<00:01:15.330> on<00:01:15.479> brush<00:01:15.630> side<00:01:15.960> but<00:01:16.710> on<00:01:16.920> the<00:01:17.040> side

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:17.250 
matter on brush side but on the side

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.580 
matter on brush side but on the side
that<00:01:17.280> has<00:01:17.610> to<00:01:18.000> this<00:01:18.869> is<00:01:19.110> where<00:01:19.320> you're<00:01:19.470> going

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:19.590 
that has to this is where you're going

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.370 
that has to this is where you're going
to<00:01:19.710> put<00:01:19.830> the<00:01:20.009> water<00:01:20.420> so<00:01:21.420> put<00:01:21.630> the<00:01:21.750> water<00:01:22.049> flow

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
to put the water so put the water flow

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.300 
to put the water so put the water flow
right<00:01:22.860> here<00:01:23.340> and<00:01:23.939> dig<00:01:24.240> down<00:01:24.600> one<00:01:25.380> right<00:01:25.920> here

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
right here and dig down one right here

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:30.950 
right here and dig down one right here
so<00:01:27.210> it's<00:01:27.360> like<00:01:27.420> that<00:01:28.009> then<00:01:29.009> what<00:01:29.759> you<00:01:29.970> can<00:01:30.150> do

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
so it's like that then what you can do

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.039 
so it's like that then what you can do
remove<00:01:31.619> this<00:01:31.950> dirt<00:01:32.250> now<00:01:32.970> because<00:01:33.390> this<00:01:33.720> hole

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
remove this dirt now because this hole

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.609 
remove this dirt now because this hole
is<00:01:34.350> here<00:01:34.650> so<00:01:35.009> it's<00:01:35.159> two<00:01:35.400> down<00:01:35.990> this<00:01:36.990> will<00:01:37.439> not

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
is here so it's two down this will not

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.300 
is here so it's two down this will not
blow<00:01:38.130> in<00:01:38.430> here<00:01:38.930> so<00:01:39.930> you're<00:01:40.799> going<00:01:40.920> to<00:01:41.009> put<00:01:41.159> your

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
blow in here so you're going to put your

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.319 
blow in here so you're going to put your
lava<00:01:41.579> on<00:01:41.970> the<00:01:42.210> opposite<00:01:42.780> end<00:01:43.700> there<00:01:44.700> you<00:01:44.909> go

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:45.329 
lava on the opposite end there you go

00:01:45.329 --> 00:01:50.410 
lava on the opposite end there you go
it's<00:01:45.930> that<00:01:46.110> simple<00:01:46.700> whoa<00:01:47.729> sorry<00:01:48.720> guys<00:01:48.869> lag

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:50.420 
it's that simple whoa sorry guys lag

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:54.249 
it's that simple whoa sorry guys lag
incident<00:01:51.420> cobblestone<00:01:52.189> now<00:01:53.189> you<00:01:53.250> can<00:01:53.579> put

00:01:54.249 --> 00:01:54.259 
incident cobblestone now you can put

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:56.719 
incident cobblestone now you can put
yeah<00:01:55.259> you<00:01:55.320> saw<00:01:55.590> that<00:01:55.619> just<00:01:56.009> got<00:01:56.100> destroyed<00:01:56.460> so

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:56.729 
yeah you saw that just got destroyed so

00:01:56.729 --> 00:01:59.090 
yeah you saw that just got destroyed so
what<00:01:57.060> you<00:01:57.210> knew<00:01:57.390> once<00:01:57.810> it's<00:01:57.990> generated<00:01:58.500> walk

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
what you knew once it's generated walk

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:01.399 
what you knew once it's generated walk
up<00:01:59.430> as<00:01:59.670> far<00:01:59.969> as<00:02:00.000> you<00:02:00.270> can<00:02:00.540> against<00:02:01.020> the<00:02:01.170> block

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
up as far as you can against the block

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:05.240 
up as far as you can against the block
and<00:02:01.920> then<00:02:02.820> just<00:02:03.030> hold<00:02:03.329> down<00:02:03.450> your<00:02:03.659> mouse<00:02:04.250> but

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:05.250 
and then just hold down your mouse but

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.819 
and then just hold down your mouse but
you<00:02:05.369> can<00:02:05.670> add<00:02:05.909> pistons<00:02:06.540> to<00:02:06.869> hide<00:02:07.140> this<00:02:07.409> in<00:02:07.710> your

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
you can add pistons to hide this in your

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.840 
you can add pistons to hide this in your
floor<00:02:08.190> to<00:02:08.640> add<00:02:08.910> a<00:02:09.110> piston<00:02:10.110> right<00:02:10.379> here

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:10.850 
floor to add a piston right here

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:13.030 
floor to add a piston right here
and<00:02:10.940> add<00:02:11.290> 5<00:02:12.290> o'clock<00:02:12.680> or<00:02:12.890> something

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:13.040 
and add 5 o'clock or something

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.710 
and add 5 o'clock or something
connecting<00:02:13.850> to<00:02:14.000> that<00:02:14.090> piston

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:14.720 
connecting to that piston

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.940 
connecting to that piston
so<00:02:15.020> we'll<00:02:15.170> continuously<00:02:15.860> try<00:02:16.160> to<00:02:16.220> push<00:02:16.610> up

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:17.950 
so we'll continuously try to push up

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:20.320 
so we'll continuously try to push up
that's<00:02:18.950> actually<00:02:19.220> what<00:02:19.610> I<00:02:19.640> did<00:02:19.910> and<00:02:20.120> then<00:02:20.240> you

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:20.330 
that's actually what I did and then you

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.420
