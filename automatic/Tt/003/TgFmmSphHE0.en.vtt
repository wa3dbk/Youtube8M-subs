off<00:01:28.820> the<00:01:28.850> top<00:01:29.150> of<00:01:29.270> the<00:01:29.330> bed<00:01:29.479> rails<00:01:29.720> and<00:01:29.990> I<00:01:30.979> used

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:31.430 
off the top of the bed rails and I used

00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:35.469 
off the top of the bed rails and I used
one<00:01:31.910> quart<00:01:32.270> covered<00:01:33.580> almost<00:01:34.580> all<00:01:34.910> four<00:01:35.180> sides

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:35.479 
one quart covered almost all four sides

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:38.620 
one quart covered almost all four sides
like<00:01:35.900> the<00:01:36.140> bed<00:01:36.790> it<00:01:37.790> took<00:01:38.000> like<00:01:38.090> a<00:01:38.180> quart<00:01:38.510> and<00:01:38.570> a

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:38.630 
like the bed it took like a quart and a

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:42.310 
like the bed it took like a quart and a
half<00:01:38.660> to<00:01:39.140> cover<00:01:40.060> the<00:01:41.060> sides<00:01:41.360> then<00:01:41.750> it<00:01:42.020> took<00:01:42.260> a

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:42.320 
half to cover the sides then it took a

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.530 
half to cover the sides then it took a
whole<00:01:42.560> quart<00:01:42.890> for<00:01:43.100> the<00:01:43.369> bottom<00:01:43.700> and<00:01:44.450> the

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:44.540 
whole quart for the bottom and the

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:46.780 
whole quart for the bottom and the
reason<00:01:44.810> I<00:01:44.869> did<00:01:45.050> it<00:01:45.170> in<00:01:45.260> the<00:01:45.320> quart<00:01:45.790> capacity

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:46.790 
reason I did it in the quart capacity

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:48.670 
reason I did it in the quart capacity
just<00:01:47.210> one<00:01:47.510> quarter<00:01:47.840> at<00:01:47.900> a<00:01:47.960> time<00:01:47.990> was<00:01:48.410> I<00:01:48.530> was

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:48.680 
just one quarter at a time was I was

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.310 
just one quarter at a time was I was
doing<00:01:48.920> this<00:01:49.119> they<00:01:50.119> time<00:01:50.420> off<00:01:50.630> from<00:01:50.750> work<00:01:50.840> stuff

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320 
doing this they time off from work stuff

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:54.880 
doing this they time off from work stuff
like<00:01:51.500> that<00:01:51.770> evenings<00:01:52.430> when<00:01:52.550> I<00:01:52.640> come<00:01:52.790> home<00:01:53.560> so<00:01:54.560> I

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:54.890 
like that evenings when I come home so I

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:55.990 
like that evenings when I come home so I
wasn't<00:01:55.250> trying<00:01:55.430> to<00:01:55.460> get<00:01:55.610> the<00:01:55.729> whole<00:01:55.850> thing

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.000 
wasn't trying to get the whole thing

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.340 
wasn't trying to get the whole thing
done<00:01:56.060> in<00:01:56.330> one<00:01:56.450> shot<00:01:56.479> and<00:01:56.869> I<00:01:56.930> wasn't<00:01:57.110> going<00:01:57.259> to

00:01:57.340 --> 00:01:57.350 
done in one shot and I wasn't going to

00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:58.810 
done in one shot and I wasn't going to
spray<00:01:57.590> it<00:01:57.619> I<00:01:57.800> wanted<00:01:58.009> to<00:01:58.070> roll<00:01:58.250> it<00:01:58.400> on<00:01:58.460> give<00:01:58.729> it

00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:58.820 
spray it I wanted to roll it on give it

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.360 
spray it I wanted to roll it on give it
a<00:01:58.880> thicker<00:01:59.090> coat<00:01:59.360> so<00:02:00.110> I<00:02:00.440> did<00:02:00.770> like<00:02:00.980> the<00:02:01.160> side

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:01.370 
a thicker coat so I did like the side

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:03.790 
a thicker coat so I did like the side
rails<00:02:01.700> the<00:02:02.480> back<00:02:02.720> of<00:02:02.930> the<00:02:03.050> truck<00:02:03.320> here<00:02:03.590> or<00:02:03.710> the

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:03.800 
rails the back of the truck here or the

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:04.889 
rails the back of the truck here or the
front<00:02:04.070> of<00:02:04.130> the<00:02:04.190> bed<00:02:04.370> and<00:02:04.610> then

00:02:04.889 --> 00:02:04.899 
front of the bed and then

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:08.699 
front of the bed and then
so<00:02:05.770> I<00:02:05.799> did<00:02:05.979> the<00:02:06.130> sections<00:02:06.549> and<00:02:06.990> so<00:02:07.990> having<00:02:08.470> the

00:02:08.699 --> 00:02:08.709 
so I did the sections and so having the

00:02:08.709 --> 00:02:10.979 
so I did the sections and so having the
functionality<00:02:09.369> of<00:02:09.399> a<00:02:09.489> court<00:02:10.090> and<00:02:10.360> only<00:02:10.750> using

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:10.989 
functionality of a court and only using

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:13.949 
functionality of a court and only using
that<00:02:11.080> court<00:02:11.379> at<00:02:11.590> a<00:02:11.620> time<00:02:12.599> helped<00:02:13.599> me<00:02:13.750> to

00:02:13.949 --> 00:02:13.959 
that court at a time helped me to

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:16.170 
that court at a time helped me to
control<00:02:14.410> the<00:02:14.470> flow<00:02:15.250> control<00:02:15.700> how<00:02:15.819> much<00:02:15.940> I<00:02:16.090> was

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:16.180 
control the flow control how much I was

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:17.550 
control the flow control how much I was
using<00:02:16.360> than<00:02:16.599> wasting<00:02:16.959> it<00:02:17.080> because<00:02:17.290> it<00:02:17.379> dried

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:17.560 
using than wasting it because it dried

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.520 
using than wasting it because it dried
out<00:02:17.739> in<00:02:17.830> the<00:02:17.860> can<00:02:18.150> one<00:02:19.150> warning<00:02:19.540> and<00:02:20.200> using

out in the can one warning and using

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:21.539 
out in the can one warning and using
this<00:02:20.620> stuff<00:02:20.800> make<00:02:21.040> sure<00:02:21.190> you're<00:02:21.400> in<00:02:21.459> a

00:02:21.539 --> 00:02:21.549 
this stuff make sure you're in a

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:23.580 
this stuff make sure you're in a
well-ventilated<00:02:21.629> area<00:02:22.629> it<00:02:22.780> stinks<00:02:23.290> something

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590 
well-ventilated area it stinks something

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:24.960 
well-ventilated area it stinks something
fierce<00:02:23.830> and<00:02:24.069> even<00:02:24.250> out<00:02:24.370> here<00:02:24.549> in<00:02:24.640> the<00:02:24.730> open

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:24.970 
fierce and even out here in the open

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.089 
fierce and even out here in the open
where<00:02:25.000> I<00:02:25.150> did<00:02:25.360> it<00:02:25.450> into<00:02:25.569> my<00:02:25.690> driveway<00:02:26.099> the

00:02:27.089 --> 00:02:27.099 
where I did it into my driveway the

00:02:27.099 --> 00:02:29.430 
where I did it into my driveway the
fumes<00:02:27.670> were<00:02:27.879> still<00:02:28.239> here<00:02:28.480> in<00:02:28.569> the<00:02:28.660> bed<00:02:28.810> so<00:02:29.140> if

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:29.440 
fumes were still here in the bed so if

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.470 
fumes were still here in the bed so if
you<00:02:29.620> can<00:02:29.799> do<00:02:29.920> it<00:02:30.040> on<00:02:30.129> a<00:02:30.160> slightly<00:02:30.610> breezy<00:02:31.090> day

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
you can do it on a slightly breezy day

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:33.839 
you can do it on a slightly breezy day
that<00:02:31.720> would<00:02:31.840> help<00:02:32.019> to<00:02:32.890> carry<00:02:33.430> some<00:02:33.700> of<00:02:33.760> the

00:02:33.839 --> 00:02:33.849 
that would help to carry some of the

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:35.729 
that would help to carry some of the
snow<00:02:34.060> away<00:02:34.239> I<00:02:34.540> did<00:02:34.720> it<00:02:34.840> on<00:02:34.930> a<00:02:34.989> warm<00:02:35.230> day<00:02:35.410> here<00:02:35.440> in

00:02:35.729 --> 00:02:35.739 
snow away I did it on a warm day here in

00:02:35.739 --> 00:02:37.830 
snow away I did it on a warm day here in
the<00:02:35.890> Phoenix<00:02:36.250> area<00:02:36.459> and<00:02:37.120> it<00:02:37.420> was<00:02:37.510> stagnant

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:37.840 
the Phoenix area and it was stagnant

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.120 
the Phoenix area and it was stagnant
there<00:02:38.019> wasn't<00:02:38.230> a<00:02:38.290> lot<00:02:38.380> of<00:02:38.410> air<00:02:38.620> movement<00:02:38.860> so<00:02:39.069> it

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:39.130 
there wasn't a lot of air movement so it

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:41.819 
there wasn't a lot of air movement so it
didn't<00:02:39.340> help<00:02:39.989> if<00:02:40.989> you<00:02:41.110> look<00:02:41.260> over<00:02:41.500> here<00:02:41.530> at<00:02:41.739> the

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:41.829 
didn't help if you look over here at the

00:02:41.829 --> 00:02:44.130 
didn't help if you look over here at the
bed<00:02:42.010> you<00:02:42.190> can<00:02:42.220> see<00:02:42.489> where<00:02:42.700> this<00:02:43.180> gets<00:02:43.930> only

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:44.140 
bed you can see where this gets only

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.650 
bed you can see where this gets only
like<00:02:44.349> a<00:02:44.380> 2<00:02:44.620> cup<00:02:44.829> layer<00:02:45.069> and<00:02:45.340> it's<00:02:45.459> thin<00:02:45.730> you<00:02:46.480> can

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 
like a 2 cup layer and it's thin you can

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:49.229 
like a 2 cup layer and it's thin you can
see<00:02:46.690> where<00:02:47.049> it's<00:02:47.200> cuffed<00:02:47.500> off<00:02:47.739> already<00:02:48.160> so<00:02:48.549> my

00:02:49.229 --> 00:02:49.239 
see where it's cuffed off already so my

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:50.610 
see where it's cuffed off already so my
suggestion<00:02:49.690> is<00:02:49.900> if<00:02:50.049> you're<00:02:50.140> going<00:02:50.290> to<00:02:50.379> do<00:02:50.470> the

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
suggestion is if you're going to do the

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:53.520 
suggestion is if you're going to do the
rust-oleum<00:02:50.920> roll<00:02:51.400> on<00:02:51.549> bed<00:02:51.760> liner<00:02:52.319> scuff<00:02:53.319> it<00:02:53.410> up

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
rust-oleum roll on bed liner scuff it up

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.589 
rust-oleum roll on bed liner scuff it up
better<00:02:53.860> than<00:02:54.129> I<00:02:54.220> did<00:02:54.370> I<00:02:54.430> mean<00:02:54.640> really<00:02:54.940> you

00:02:55.589 --> 00:02:55.599 
better than I did I mean really you

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:58.619 
better than I did I mean really you
don't<00:02:55.750> have<00:02:55.870> to<00:02:55.959> hit<00:02:56.049> it<00:02:56.200> hard<00:02:56.230> but<00:02:56.890> I<00:02:57.629> scuffed

00:02:58.619 --> 00:02:58.629 
don't have to hit it hard but I scuffed

00:02:58.629 --> 00:02:59.850 
don't have to hit it hard but I scuffed
it<00:02:58.780> through<00:02:59.049> and<00:02:59.319> what<00:02:59.500> I<00:02:59.530> should<00:02:59.829> have

00:02:59.850 --> 00:02:59.860 
it through and what I should have

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.039 
it through and what I should have
probably<00:03:00.069> done<00:03:00.340> was<00:03:00.579> come<00:03:00.790> back<00:03:01.000> wash<00:03:01.750> it<00:03:01.930> all

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:02.049 
probably done was come back wash it all

00:03:02.049 --> 00:03:04.410 
probably done was come back wash it all
down<00:03:02.220> degree<00:03:03.220> stick<00:03:03.459> and<00:03:03.640> then<00:03:03.910> scuffed<00:03:04.329> it

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:04.420 
down degree stick and then scuffed it

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:06.509 
down degree stick and then scuffed it
one<00:03:04.599> more<00:03:04.780> time<00:03:05.019> just<00:03:05.290> hitting<00:03:06.069> it<00:03:06.160> so<00:03:06.459> you

00:03:06.509 --> 00:03:06.519 
one more time just hitting it so you

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:07.949 
one more time just hitting it so you
make<00:03:06.730> sure<00:03:06.910> you<00:03:07.030> get<00:03:07.150> the<00:03:07.299> spots<00:03:07.569> and<00:03:07.780> then

00:03:07.949 --> 00:03:07.959 
make sure you get the spots and then

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:10.440 
make sure you get the spots and then
this<00:03:08.560> is<00:03:08.739> only<00:03:08.859> to<00:03:09.100> coat<00:03:09.310> layer<00:03:09.609> I<00:03:09.880> need<00:03:10.239> to

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:10.450 
this is only to coat layer I need to

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:12.240 
this is only to coat layer I need to
come<00:03:10.660> back<00:03:10.690> and<00:03:11.109> do<00:03:11.170> a<00:03:11.200> third<00:03:11.500> coat<00:03:11.739> layer<00:03:11.980> and

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:12.250 
come back and do a third coat layer and

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:13.949 
come back and do a third coat layer and
that<00:03:12.639> would<00:03:12.850> probably<00:03:13.000> seal<00:03:13.389> this<00:03:13.540> up<00:03:13.690> enough

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:13.959 
that would probably seal this up enough

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:16.050 
that would probably seal this up enough
to<00:03:14.230> prevent<00:03:15.190> most<00:03:15.489> of<00:03:15.639> these<00:03:15.730> little

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
to prevent most of these little

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.720 
to prevent most of these little
scratches<00:03:16.269> and<00:03:16.690> pieces<00:03:17.170> coming<00:03:17.380> off<00:03:17.590> so<00:03:18.489> that

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
scratches and pieces coming off so that

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:20.970 
scratches and pieces coming off so that
was<00:03:18.940> a<00:03:18.970> step<00:03:19.810> number<00:03:20.019> whatever<00:03:20.500> for<00:03:20.829> the

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:20.980 
was a step number whatever for the

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:23.640 
was a step number whatever for the
Silverado<00:03:21.450> the<00:03:22.450> next<00:03:23.049> thing<00:03:23.260> will<00:03:23.500> be<00:03:23.530> a

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:23.650 
Silverado the next thing will be a

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:25.199 
Silverado the next thing will be a
camper<00:03:24.130> shell<00:03:24.280> I'm<00:03:24.430> working<00:03:24.700> on<00:03:24.790> I'll<00:03:25.030> show

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:25.209 
camper shell I'm working on I'll show

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:28.729 
camper shell I'm working on I'll show
you<00:03:25.269> that<00:03:25.510> in<00:03:25.690> a<00:03:25.810> next<00:03:26.319> video<00:03:26.440> probably<00:03:26.859> oh

00:03:28.729 --> 00:03:28.739 
you that in a next video probably oh

yeah the cameraman pointed out this

00:03:32.019 --> 00:03:34.979 
yeah the cameraman pointed out this
truck<00:03:32.290> had<00:03:32.410> a<00:03:32.440> bent<00:03:32.769> and<00:03:32.950> damaged<00:03:33.989> tailgate

had another there with a hacksaw and

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.339 
had another there with a hacksaw and
waxed<00:03:40.120> it<00:03:40.209> all<00:03:40.329> out<00:03:40.510> got<00:03:40.750> it<00:03:40.900> out<00:03:40.989> from<00:03:41.169> under

00:03:41.339 --> 00:03:41.349 
waxed it all out got it out from under

waxed it all out got it out from under
there<00:03:41.530> and<00:03:41.680> I<00:03:42.489> bought<00:03:42.700> from<00:03:44.310> lMC<00:03:45.310> Truck<00:03:45.900> at

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:46.900 
there and I bought from lMC Truck at

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.170 
there and I bought from lMC Truck at
Edna<00:03:47.410> bed<00:03:47.919> mount<00:03:48.160> for<00:03:48.400> the<00:03:48.430> spare<00:03:48.700> tire<00:03:48.940> so

00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:08.920 
the damage to tire hanger underneath

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:11.190 
the damage to tire hanger underneath
plus<00:04:09.220> I<00:04:09.459> got<00:04:10.360> a<00:04:10.390> nice<00:04:10.569> bumper<00:04:10.900> I'm<00:04:10.990> going<00:04:11.140> to

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:11.200 
plus I got a nice bumper I'm going to

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:12.809 
plus I got a nice bumper I'm going to
put<00:04:11.290> on<00:04:11.380> the<00:04:11.470> back<00:04:11.620> of<00:04:11.770> it<00:04:11.860> and<00:04:11.980> I<00:04:12.490> like<00:04:12.640> the

00:04:12.809 --> 00:04:12.819 
put on the back of it and I like the

00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:14.670 
put on the back of it and I like the
idea<00:04:12.850> is<00:04:13.150> still<00:04:13.209> being<00:04:13.540> able<00:04:13.630> to<00:04:13.780> see<00:04:13.959> the<00:04:14.170> axle

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:14.680 
idea is still being able to see the axle

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:16.560 
idea is still being able to see the axle
and<00:04:14.830> stuff<00:04:15.160> underneath<00:04:15.400> I'm<00:04:15.850> going<00:04:16.060> to<00:04:16.120> the

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570 
and stuff underneath I'm going to the

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:17.910 
and stuff underneath I'm going to the
axles<00:04:16.870> in<00:04:16.930> good<00:04:17.079> shape<00:04:17.230> I've<00:04:17.440> had<00:04:17.590> some<00:04:17.769> work

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:17.920 
axles in good shape I've had some work

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:19.920 
axles in good shape I've had some work
done<00:04:17.950> to<00:04:18.250> it<00:04:18.340> so<00:04:19.269> I'm<00:04:19.359> going<00:04:19.480> to<00:04:19.570> get<00:04:19.720> under

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:19.930 
done to it so I'm going to get under

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:21.090 
done to it so I'm going to get under
there<00:04:20.109> and<00:04:20.140> I'm<00:04:20.320> going<00:04:20.470> to<00:04:20.530> coat<00:04:20.799> it<00:04:20.950> with<00:04:21.070> a

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:21.100 
there and I'm going to coat it with a

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:24.060 
there and I'm going to coat it with a
satin<00:04:21.579> finish<00:04:21.760> coat<00:04:22.120> and<00:04:22.560> seal<00:04:23.560> it<00:04:23.680> up<00:04:23.740> I<00:04:23.890> might

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:24.070 
satin finish coat and seal it up I might

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:25.890 
satin finish coat and seal it up I might
put<00:04:24.340> a<00:04:24.370> I<00:04:24.669> might<00:04:25.030> paint<00:04:25.240> the<00:04:25.390> differential<00:04:25.870> I

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:25.900 
put a I might paint the differential I

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:27.150 
put a I might paint the differential I
don't<00:04:26.169> know<00:04:26.260> I<00:04:26.290> may<00:04:26.470> just<00:04:26.650> leave<00:04:26.770> all<00:04:26.890> black

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:27.160 
don't know I may just leave all black

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.700 
don't know I may just leave all black
but<00:04:27.370> since<00:04:27.550> there's<00:04:27.730> axle<00:04:28.150> work<00:04:28.390> done<00:04:28.710> both

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:29.710 
but since there's axle work done both

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:31.230 
but since there's axle work done both
bearings<00:04:30.100> replaced<00:04:30.400> on<00:04:30.550> both<00:04:30.669> sides<00:04:30.910> all<00:04:31.120> the

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:31.240 
bearings replaced on both sides all the

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.570 
bearings replaced on both sides all the
fluids<00:04:31.540> been<00:04:31.690> changed<00:04:32.050> and<00:04:32.200> the<00:04:32.919> differential

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:33.580 
fluids been changed and the differential

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:35.340 
fluids been changed and the differential
cover<00:04:33.730> gaskets<00:04:34.419> been<00:04:34.570> replaced<00:04:34.930> I<00:04:35.140> thought

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:35.350 
cover gaskets been replaced I thought

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:36.830 
cover gaskets been replaced I thought
it'd<00:04:35.440> be<00:04:35.530> a<00:04:35.560> good<00:04:35.710> time<00:04:35.950> to<00:04:36.100> go<00:04:36.220> ahead<00:04:36.250> and

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
it'd be a good time to go ahead and

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.090 
it'd be a good time to go ahead and
recoat<00:04:37.840> the<00:04:38.020> rear<00:04:38.200> axle<00:04:38.590> just<00:04:38.860> to<00:04:38.919> make<00:04:39.070> it

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:39.100 
recoat the rear axle just to make it
