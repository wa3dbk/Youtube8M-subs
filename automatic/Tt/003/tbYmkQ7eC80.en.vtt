00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:13.610 
products I don't know why I started
noticing<00:02:11.489> it<00:02:11.880> but<00:02:12.060> I<00:02:12.090> was<00:02:12.360> already<00:02:12.590> into<00:02:13.590> it

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
noticing it but I was already into it

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:14.690 
noticing it but I was already into it
and<00:02:13.890> I<00:02:13.980> said<00:02:14.280> forget<00:02:14.519> it

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:14.700

00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.250 
just rub that through then I tie my hair
down<00:03:51.280> the<00:03:51.909> hair<00:03:52.150> time<00:03:52.420> that<00:03:52.599> I<00:03:52.629> use<00:03:52.959> I<00:03:53.200> will

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:53.260 
down the hair time that I use I will

00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:59.059 
down the hair time that I use I will
insert<00:03:53.650> a<00:03:53.680> picture<00:03:53.889> of<00:03:54.099> it

00:03:59.059 --> 00:03:59.069 

00:03:59.069 --> 00:04:01.309 

so<00:03:59.670> as<00:03:59.879> you<00:04:00.030> can<00:04:00.150> see<00:04:00.209> this<00:04:00.480> hair<00:04:00.750> tie<00:04:00.989> is<00:04:01.049> not

00:04:01.309 --> 00:04:01.319 
so as you can see this hair tie is not

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:04.280 
so as you can see this hair tie is not
your<00:04:01.500> regular<00:04:01.650> satin<00:04:02.340> body<00:04:02.579> this<00:04:03.209> is<00:04:03.420> made<00:04:03.689> to

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290 
your regular satin body this is made to

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:06.860

twist<00:04:09.989> it<00:04:10.170> up<00:04:10.260> and<00:04:10.620> then<00:04:11.459> I<00:04:11.519> put<00:04:11.760> my<00:04:11.790> satin

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:28.380 
week and I just redo this but I don't

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:29.749 
week and I just redo this but I don't
have<00:04:28.500> to<00:04:28.590> do<00:04:28.710> that<00:04:28.860> with<00:04:29.039> these<00:04:29.220> I'm<00:04:29.520> really

00:04:29.749 --> 00:04:29.759

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:31.590 
happy about that so I guess I'll

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:33.950 
happy about that so I guess I'll
probably<00:04:31.770> have<00:04:31.979> to<00:04:32.099> redo<00:04:32.130> the<00:04:32.750> edges<00:04:33.750> of<00:04:33.870> my
