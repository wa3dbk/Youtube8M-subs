00:00:01.979 --> 00:00:08.010
 liberated simply 

00:00:03.970 --> 00:00:10.809
 let's say so rolled in the seasons it is already 

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:12.640
 the fifth time the calculations that is naturally 

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:14.940
 the team will recruit every day 

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:16.150
 momentum here well guys well done just 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.150
 dedication 

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:20.050
 a little better movement became like 

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.330
 result 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:27.070

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:28.769

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:35.079
 first of all after all but after that 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:36.820
 with Donetsk methane t-shirt hung out 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:38.829
 need to say a big thank you to the team on 

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:42.519

00:00:42.519 --> 00:00:49.149

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:55.230
 Anyway, are there any 

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:57.850
 problems just somewhere 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:00.670
 the most was the return everywhere we are 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.410
 that is, usually when you work on 

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:04.300
 the court football field will come 

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:06.280
 the result so here comes the era 

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:08.850
 so I hope that we will not reset 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.899

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.610
