00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:08.440
 today we are going to get on the new edition 

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:09.790
 of the ford ecosport a vehicle that in 

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:11.860
 the previous edition was a success 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:14.320
 absolute sales in our country and in 

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:17.230
 the region and in this new generation we 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:20.050
 let's go up to the titanium version 2.0 

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:23.430
 which is the most equipped in 4 by 2 or 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:23.430
 only with front wheel drive 

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:32.090
 the ford ecosport created a new kind of 

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:35.420
 vehicles in our region when 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:37.370
 appeared already in 2003 was the first suv 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:40.520
 sport utility vehicle and how I know 

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:43.730
 know in urban and popular that is to say with 

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:45.949
 the whole pint of an onerous 4x4 and the 

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.960
 price of a model of the small segment or 

00:00:45.949 --> 00:00:50.570
 medium since it is a derivative of the car 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:52.730
 boy at that time was the party 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:55.370
 one and now it is from the kinetic party 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.170
 design this is a category that grew 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.300
 a lot in our country and it will continue 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.280
 growing globally also since 

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:04.070
 recently there are presentations 

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:06.680
 very important as the reindeer capture 

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:09.890
 which is a derivative of the clio the product 

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:12.289
 2008 derived from the 208 and the volkswagen 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.600
 taiwo also in our region them 

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:17.210
 came a key competitor that is the 

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.770
 renault duster derived from sandero esta 

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:20.450
 new body difference from the previous 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.820
 that was only sold to our region and 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:25.820
 is a global model is a global model 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:28.280
 of fort following this policy of the 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:31.310
 brand that is called one ford that 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.580
 means that they have a model in each 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.770
 category one 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:36.930
 whatever they are but that are models for 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.790
 sell all over the world and not models 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.640
 specific to each region as it happens 

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:44.250
 With many ecosport brands it impresses 

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.470
 for its modern and robust design that 

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:48.780
 It looks a lot like the ford kuga with 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.510
 this reaffirms this concept of resembling 

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:54.630
 to a 4x4 high-end design by 

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:57.060
 course kinetic design is the most 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:58.980
 striking and also has the wheel 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.360
 help back in the tailgate that 

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:03.210
 this is what this aspect also gives 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.310
 of 4x4 with a system of opening the 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:09.750
 trunk interesting since it is not necessary 

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.979
 unfold any type of arms or anything 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.260
 to open the doors but simply 

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:15.900
 the door is attached to the trunk and one 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.970
 you just have to open the door and the 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.070
 wheel accompanies the trunk without any 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:20.670
 problem is a bit heavier but 

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:24.150
 nothing else 

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.950
 the opening of the trunk is concealed in 

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:27.930
 one of the rear optics what gives 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.390
 a very interesting design detail 

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.190
 another strength of the arba confort is its level 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:34.440
 of equipment is impressive with 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:37.290
 details of a lot of category like 

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:39.420
 example the proximity keys asia de 

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.680
 proximity allows 

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:42.390
 have the key in your pocket and 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.150
 simply approaching the vehicle 

00:02:42.390 --> 00:02:46.500
 can open the door and more if I put 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:50.099
 Key nowhere and not even 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:51.620
 press the remote control button and 

00:02:50.099 --> 00:02:53.310
 the same thing happens with the start 

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.599
 simply with him always and always 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.430
 having the key in your pocket one 

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:58.080
 you can press the start button and 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.810
 just start the engine 

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.850
 another very important detail is zinc 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:05.310
 is the system developed by microsoft 

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:07.650
 which is a voice command with which 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:10.110
 they can command not only the telephone 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:12.810
 but also several functions of the 

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:15.120
 vehicle in terms of safety has 

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:18.959
 six airbags traction control and 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:21.180
 ABS stability braking assistance 

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:23.819
 urgency the beacons that light 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:26.190
 when it detects that the braking is abrupt 

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:28.140
 Isofix anchors for the chair of the 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:30.150
 children of the rear seats or be a 

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:32.220
 vehicle with all the equipment 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:34.530
 safety of a high-end car 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:36.180
 it also has a logical space in the 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:39.690
 inside so they leave comfortably 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:41.880
 five passengers and an acceptable trunk with 

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:44.070
 the possibility of overturning the seats 

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:45.390
 backs forward and increase the 

00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:47.730
 Loading capacity 

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:50.370
 the version we tested is 2.0 

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:52.580
 titanium or the most equipped that came 

00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:56.010
 with leather upholstery back seat 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:58.260
 folding and foldable 60-40 armchair 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:00.030
 driver with lumbar adjustment armchair 

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:02.130
 control with manual adjustment also 

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.570
 height automatic closing of doors to 

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:04.880
 the 20 kilometers per hour 

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:07.290
 Central locking of doors 

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:10.410
 radio automatic climate control with 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:13.500
 USB connectivity and bluetooth sensor 

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:14.940
 rear parking lots and take 12 

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:17.190
 volts both in the compartments 

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:18.359
 front as back 

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:20.310
 respect of the behavior car 

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:22.200
 dynamic we have to say that it has a 

00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:24.990
 good ride comfort and that although not 

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:26.700
 is a 4x4 does the double version 

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:28.590
 Traction will be presented this year equal 

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:30.960
 that also the diesel version has a 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:33.930
 good clearance of the soil something like 20 

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:35.940
 centimeters to get out some of 

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:38.400
 asphalt and dabble a bit in roads 

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:42.710
 of gravel or dirt can even be worth 

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:42.710
 up to 55 centimeters deep 

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:52.180
 Let's go over the technical sheet of the 

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:55.260
 ford ecosport is a gasoline engine of 4 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:58.090
 cylinders 16 valves one displacement 

00:04:55.260 --> 00:05:02.350
 1999 cubic centimeters the power is 

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:05.170
 of 143 horses has a torque of 187 

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:07.450
 newton meters from the 4 000 250 

00:05:05.170 --> 00:05:09.370
 revolutions per minute and the manual box 

00:05:07.450 --> 00:05:11.770
 It is 5 speeds with traction 

00:05:09.370 --> 00:05:13.570
 front as we said the kind of 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:16.300
 floors of 200 millimeters or 20 

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:19.570
 centimeters fording capacity 550 

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:23.710
 millimeters or 55 centimeters in a tank 

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:27.820
 of fuel of 52 liters weighs thousand 200 

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:29.470
 one thousand 97 kilos has a trunk of 362 

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:32.500
 cubic decimeters or liters that can 

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:34.570
 get to have 700 5 cubic centimeters 

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:36.430
 18 cubic or liters if we dump the 

00:05:34.570 --> 00:05:40.630
 forward the rear seats 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:42.970
 tires are 200 560 r 16 with rims 

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:45.760
 of alloy with respect to performance 

00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:46.840
 with a maximum speed of 175 

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:49.090
 kilometers per hour 

00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:51.139
 accelerates from 0 to 100 in 12 seconds and a 

00:05:49.090 --> 00:05:54.430
 average consumption of 10 liters 

00:05:51.139 --> 00:05:54.430
 every 100 kilometers 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:06:01.020
 we get a very pleasant feeling of 

00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:02.850
 this way of coexport both for your 

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:04.830
 style for this design kinetic design 

00:06:02.850 --> 00:06:06.630
 which is spectacular is really called 

00:06:04.830 --> 00:06:08.550
 much attention people People 

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:10.500
 really like this vehicle and also because 

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:13.050
 its incredible level of equipment for 

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:15.120
 the category has many many 

00:06:13.050 --> 00:06:17.880
 segment vehicle equipment 

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:19.980
 higher segments this first 

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:21.870
 So as a conclusion we can say 

00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:24.530
 that the ford ecosport is a great option 

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:24.530
 Conversion
