honesty you can have trouble with this
and<00:00:31.800> there<00:00:32.009> is<00:00:32.130> one<00:00:32.369> reason<00:00:32.610> why<00:00:32.759> I'll<00:00:33.090> explain

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
and there is one reason why I'll explain

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.180 
and there is one reason why I'll explain
that<00:00:33.600> a<00:00:33.750> little<00:00:33.960> bit<00:00:34.110> but<00:00:34.260> first<00:00:34.530> off<00:00:34.710> you'll

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:35.190 
that a little bit but first off you'll

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:36.530 
that a little bit but first off you'll
notice<00:00:35.489> that<00:00:35.520> she's<00:00:35.760> kind<00:00:35.969> of<00:00:36.030> protected<00:00:36.420> by<00:00:36.510> a

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:36.540 
notice that she's kind of protected by a

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.209 
notice that she's kind of protected by a
force<00:00:36.600> field<00:00:36.899> and<00:00:37.260> basically<00:00:37.829> you<00:00:37.980> have<00:00:38.100> to

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219 
force field and basically you have to

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:40.280 
force field and basically you have to
destroy<00:00:38.520> the<00:00:38.670> three<00:00:38.940> kind<00:00:39.210> of<00:00:39.360> death<00:00:39.960> idols

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
destroy the three kind of death idols

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:42.880 
destroy the three kind of death idols
around<00:00:40.440> her<00:00:40.829> pretty<00:00:41.489> self-explanatory<00:00:41.809> but

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:42.890 
around her pretty self-explanatory but

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.229 
around her pretty self-explanatory but
yeah<00:00:43.890> I<00:00:43.920> figured<00:00:44.100> I<00:00:44.430> should<00:00:44.640> go<00:00:44.789> over<00:00:45.120> it<00:00:45.210> in

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
yeah I figured I should go over it in

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.029 
yeah I figured I should go over it in
case<00:00:45.510> some<00:00:45.750> if<00:00:45.870> you<00:00:45.960> were<00:00:46.079> like<00:00:46.320> what<00:00:46.710> do<00:00:47.010> you

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039 
case some if you were like what do you

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:52.010 
case some if you were like what do you
do<00:00:47.399> I<00:00:47.700> don't<00:00:48.090> know<00:00:48.230> um<00:00:49.820> yeah<00:00:50.820> but<00:00:51.480> once<00:00:51.899> you

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:52.020 
do I don't know um yeah but once you

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.900 
do I don't know um yeah but once you
kill<00:00:52.199> them<00:00:52.320> she<00:00:52.379> initiate<00:00:53.010> as<00:00:53.190> soon<00:00:53.699> as<00:00:53.820> you

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:53.910 
kill them she initiate as soon as you

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:57.200 
kill them she initiate as soon as you
killed<00:00:54.120> the<00:00:54.210> last<00:00:54.360> one<00:00:54.629> and<00:00:55.610> just<00:00:56.610> be<00:00:56.789> aware<00:00:57.030> of

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.210 
killed the last one and just be aware of

00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:58.970 
killed the last one and just be aware of
that<00:00:57.420> so<00:00:57.719> if<00:00:57.930> you<00:00:58.109> want<00:00:58.320> to<00:00:58.410> heal<00:00:58.590> up<00:00:58.770> for

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
that so if you want to heal up for

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:01.849 
that so if you want to heal up for
anything<00:00:59.160> I<00:00:59.640> guess<00:01:00.180> from<00:01:00.899> killing<00:01:01.320> deferens

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
anything I guess from killing deferens

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:04.490 
anything I guess from killing deferens
that<00:01:02.039> don't<00:01:02.520> attack<00:01:02.850> you<00:01:03.030> I<00:01:03.270> guess<00:01:04.049> you<00:01:04.170> could

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
that don't attack you I guess you could

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:08.719 
that don't attack you I guess you could
but<00:01:04.710> you<00:01:04.979> know<00:01:05.970> now<00:01:06.840> well<00:01:07.140> na<00:01:07.320> has<00:01:07.740> two

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:08.729 
but you know now well na has two

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:11.750 
but you know now well na has two
abilities<00:01:09.000> basically<00:01:09.689> she<00:01:09.930> has<00:01:10.140> a<00:01:10.470> AoE<00:01:11.400> which

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760 
abilities basically she has a AoE which

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.520 
abilities basically she has a AoE which
is<00:01:11.939> that<00:01:12.150> thing<00:01:12.360> right<00:01:12.450> there<00:01:12.510> at<00:01:12.930> black<00:01:13.140> smoke

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
is that thing right there at black smoke

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.710 
is that thing right there at black smoke
so<00:01:14.130> the<00:01:14.340> tank<00:01:14.640> needs<00:01:14.939> to<00:01:15.180> pull<00:01:15.360> her<00:01:15.479> out<00:01:15.659> of

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
so the tank needs to pull her out of

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:17.420 
so the tank needs to pull her out of
that<00:01:15.840> as<00:01:16.080> soon<00:01:16.229> as<00:01:16.350> it<00:01:16.470> drops<00:01:17.040> on<00:01:17.189> the<00:01:17.250> ground

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
that as soon as it drops on the ground

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:19.190 
that as soon as it drops on the ground
the<00:01:18.030> other<00:01:18.240> thing<00:01:18.509> she<00:01:18.630> does<00:01:18.750> is<00:01:18.780> what<00:01:19.080> you

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:19.200 
the other thing she does is what you

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.960 
the other thing she does is what you
just<00:01:19.320> saw<00:01:19.500> she<00:01:19.770> charges<00:01:20.280> someone<00:01:20.580> and<00:01:20.759> it's

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970 
just saw she charges someone and it's

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:23.450 
just saw she charges someone and it's
going<00:01:21.150> to<00:01:21.210> say<00:01:21.330> it<00:01:21.390> impales<00:01:21.810> so<00:01:22.470> and<00:01:22.619> so<00:01:22.710> now

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
going to say it impales so and so now

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.700 
going to say it impales so and so now
when<00:01:24.060> she<00:01:24.299> charges<00:01:24.720> someone<00:01:25.080> she's<00:01:25.500> going<00:01:25.650> to

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
when she charges someone she's going to

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:28.130 
when she charges someone she's going to
put<00:01:25.920> a<00:01:25.950> dot<00:01:26.220> on<00:01:26.250> them<00:01:26.549> when<00:01:27.210> that<00:01:27.360> dot<00:01:27.689> runs<00:01:27.930> out

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:28.140 
put a dot on them when that dot runs out

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.050 
put a dot on them when that dot runs out
he<00:01:28.619> will<00:01:28.829> spawn<00:01:29.040> the<00:01:29.189> ad<00:01:29.369> that<00:01:29.670> you<00:01:29.759> can<00:01:29.909> see

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
he will spawn the ad that you can see

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.140 
he will spawn the ad that you can see
right<00:01:30.090> there<00:01:31.070> what<00:01:32.070> you<00:01:32.189> need<00:01:32.369> to<00:01:32.549> do<00:01:32.670> is<00:01:32.820> the

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
right there what you need to do is the

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.210 
right there what you need to do is the
tank<00:01:33.390> needs<00:01:33.840> to<00:01:34.110> pick<00:01:34.320> that<00:01:34.710> add<00:01:34.979> up<00:01:35.420> and

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:37.220 
tank needs to pick that add up and

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.560 
tank needs to pick that add up and
theoretically<00:01:38.220> your<00:01:38.520> DPS<00:01:38.880> should<00:01:39.119> kill<00:01:39.390> them

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 
theoretically your DPS should kill them

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:42.469 
theoretically your DPS should kill them
now<00:01:40.320> the<00:01:41.070> issue<00:01:41.310> we<00:01:41.670> were<00:01:41.820> having<00:01:42.180> with<00:01:42.299> this

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
now the issue we were having with this

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:43.910 
now the issue we were having with this
this<00:01:42.630> first<00:01:42.930> one<00:01:43.110> actually<00:01:43.380> goes<00:01:43.619> a<00:01:43.770> lot

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:43.920 
this first one actually goes a lot

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.289 
this first one actually goes a lot
smoother<00:01:44.399> than<00:01:44.549> the<00:01:44.700> second<00:01:45.030> time<00:01:45.149> I've<00:01:45.270> done

00:01:45.289 --> 00:01:45.299 
smoother than the second time I've done

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:49.399 
smoother than the second time I've done
this<00:01:45.479> instance<00:01:47.210> the<00:01:48.210> issue<00:01:48.450> we<00:01:48.750> were<00:01:48.869> having

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:49.409 
this instance the issue we were having

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:51.590 
this instance the issue we were having
with<00:01:49.530> this<00:01:49.740> was<00:01:50.369> that<00:01:50.939> we<00:01:51.060> weren't<00:01:51.210> able<00:01:51.420> to

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
with this was that we weren't able to

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.719 
with this was that we weren't able to
kill<00:01:51.930> them<00:01:52.110> in<00:01:52.649> time<00:01:52.979> before<00:01:53.130> the<00:01:53.369> next<00:01:53.490> one

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
kill them in time before the next one

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:56.209 
kill them in time before the next one
spawns<00:01:54.060> and<00:01:54.390> as<00:01:54.540> all<00:01:54.750> the<00:01:54.899> DPS<00:01:55.350> was<00:01:55.560> on<00:01:55.799> the<00:01:56.040> ads

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
spawns and as all the DPS was on the ads

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:59.630 
spawns and as all the DPS was on the ads
instead<00:01:56.640> of<00:01:56.939> on<00:01:57.030> the<00:01:57.060> boss<00:01:57.299> so<00:01:58.229> one<00:01:58.950> way<00:01:59.130> we<00:01:59.340> did

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
instead of on the boss so one way we did

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:03.230 
instead of on the boss so one way we did
this<00:01:59.790> was<00:02:00.719> we<00:02:00.899> did<00:02:01.049> a<00:02:01.200> um<00:02:01.439> we<00:02:02.280> kind<00:02:02.520> of<00:02:02.640> split<00:02:03.000> it

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:03.240 
this was we did a um we kind of split it

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.160 
this was we did a um we kind of split it
we<00:02:03.750> put<00:02:04.020> one<00:02:04.380> dps<00:02:04.740> on<00:02:05.159> the<00:02:05.969> boss<00:02:06.180> which<00:02:06.840> ended

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:07.170 
we put one dps on the boss which ended

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.180 
we put one dps on the boss which ended
up<00:02:07.259> being<00:02:07.320> me

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:08.190 
up being me

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:10.640 
up being me
and<00:02:08.310> the<00:02:08.940> other<00:02:09.090> dps<00:02:09.479> focus<00:02:09.930> on<00:02:10.080> the<00:02:10.170> ads<00:02:10.320> now

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:10.650 
and the other dps focus on the ads now

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:12.230 
and the other dps focus on the ads now
the<00:02:10.710> reason<00:02:10.950> why<00:02:11.160> you<00:02:11.220> think<00:02:11.460> it<00:02:11.550> why<00:02:11.760> focus<00:02:12.030> on

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:12.240 
the reason why you think it why focus on

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:14.060 
the reason why you think it why focus on
the<00:02:12.330> end<00:02:12.480> it's<00:02:13.260> because<00:02:13.470> there's<00:02:13.830> not<00:02:13.920> a

00:02:14.060 --> 00:02:14.070 
the end it's because there's not a

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:16.280 
the end it's because there's not a
maximum<00:02:14.850> that<00:02:15.000> there<00:02:15.210> can<00:02:15.420> be<00:02:15.450> out<00:02:15.780> she's

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:16.290 
maximum that there can be out she's

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:17.660 
maximum that there can be out she's

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:19.650 
spawning them and that is where you can

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:21.860 
spawning them and that is where you can
wipe<00:02:19.950> if<00:02:20.610> you<00:02:20.910> don't<00:02:21.090> kill<00:02:21.390> enough<00:02:21.660> of<00:02:21.810> these

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.120 
away from that so we kind of went with

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.670 
away from that so we kind of went with
the<00:02:45.210> strategy<00:02:45.660> of<00:02:45.690> and<00:02:46.080> you<00:02:46.140> can<00:02:46.290> kind<00:02:46.410> of<00:02:46.500> see

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:46.680 
the strategy of and you can kind of see

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:48.590 
the strategy of and you can kind of see
I<00:02:46.710> kind<00:02:47.430> of<00:02:47.490> switch<00:02:47.700> back<00:02:47.880> and<00:02:47.910> forth<00:02:48.120> even<00:02:48.480> in

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:48.600 
I kind of switch back and forth even in

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.060 
I kind of switch back and forth even in
this<00:02:48.750> video<00:02:49.050> because<00:02:49.170> I'm<00:02:49.320> realizing<00:02:49.770> we're

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
this video because I'm realizing we're

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:52.400 
this video because I'm realizing we're
not<00:02:50.220> killing<00:02:50.490> them<00:02:50.640> in<00:02:50.790> time<00:02:50.970> and<00:02:51.410> especially

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
not killing them in time and especially

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.770 
not killing them in time and especially
once<00:02:52.770> we<00:02:52.860> lose<00:02:53.100> one<00:02:53.310> of<00:02:53.340> our<00:02:53.460> dps<00:02:53.820> in<00:02:54.090> this<00:02:54.210> it

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
once we lose one of our dps in this it

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.080 
once we lose one of our dps in this it
becomes<00:02:54.960> okay<00:02:55.470> I<00:02:55.620> just<00:02:55.890> okay<00:02:56.280> just<00:02:56.520> nuke<00:02:57.000> the

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
becomes okay I just okay just nuke the

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.030 
becomes okay I just okay just nuke the
boss<00:02:57.330> and<00:02:57.600> that<00:02:58.440> would<00:02:58.530> be<00:02:58.560> kind<00:02:58.860> of<00:02:58.890> my

00:02:59.030 --> 00:02:59.040 
boss and that would be kind of my

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.800 
boss and that would be kind of my
personal<00:02:59.520> recommendation<00:02:59.670> going<00:03:00.540> through

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:00.810 
personal recommendation going through

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:04.580 
personal recommendation going through
this<00:03:00.960> now<00:03:01.230> a<00:03:01.260> couple<00:03:01.470> times<00:03:03.050> when<00:03:04.050> it<00:03:04.170> gets<00:03:04.320> low

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:04.590 
this now a couple times when it gets low

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.390 
this now a couple times when it gets low
like<00:03:04.980> twenty<00:03:05.880> percent<00:03:06.210> go<00:03:06.930> for<00:03:07.140> the<00:03:07.260> nuke<00:03:07.530> okay

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:08.400 
like twenty percent go for the nuke okay

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.910 
like twenty percent go for the nuke okay
because<00:03:08.910> as<00:03:09.180> long<00:03:09.990> as<00:03:10.170> you<00:03:10.230> don't<00:03:10.410> have<00:03:10.650> like<00:03:10.890> a

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:10.920 
because as long as you don't have like a

00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:14.540 
because as long as you don't have like a
mass<00:03:11.250> amount<00:03:11.460> of<00:03:11.760> the<00:03:11.910> adds<00:03:12.239> up<00:03:13.160> you<00:03:14.160> can<00:03:14.370> kind

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:14.550 
mass amount of the adds up you can kind

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:16.130 
mass amount of the adds up you can kind
of<00:03:14.610> sacrifice<00:03:15.090> to<00:03:15.270> do<00:03:15.390> it<00:03:15.540> you<00:03:15.720> can<00:03:15.900> just

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.140 
of sacrifice to do it you can just

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:17.630 
of sacrifice to do it you can just
switch<00:03:16.650> on<00:03:16.800> it's<00:03:17.010> not<00:03:17.070> gonna<00:03:17.220> be<00:03:17.310> that<00:03:17.370> big<00:03:17.580> of

the other people to the ads and that way

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:16.640 
the other people to the ads and that way
they<00:04:14.880> can<00:04:15.120> kill<00:04:15.330> the<00:04:15.450> ads<00:04:15.600> if<00:04:15.930> they<00:04:16.230> kill<00:04:16.500> it
