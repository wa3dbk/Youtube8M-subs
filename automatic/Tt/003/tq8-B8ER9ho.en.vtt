speed<00:02:29.100> so<00:02:29.310> you<00:02:29.370> can<00:02:29.610> see<00:02:29.850> how<00:02:29.880> I<00:02:30.150> actually

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:30.450 
speed so you can see how I actually

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.780 
speed so you can see how I actually
handle<00:02:31.110> my<00:02:31.260> hair<00:02:31.530> notice<00:02:32.250> when<00:02:32.370> i<00:02:32.400> get<00:02:32.610> to<00:02:32.730> the

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
handle my hair notice when i get to the

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.050 
handle my hair notice when i get to the
ends<00:02:33.300> i<00:02:33.450> am<00:02:33.900> very<00:02:34.260> very<00:02:34.680> careful<00:02:35.310> to<00:02:35.880> make<00:02:36.030> sure

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060 
ends i am very very careful to make sure

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.690 
ends i am very very careful to make sure
that<00:02:36.480> i<00:02:36.570> separate<00:02:37.290> those<00:02:37.500> ends<00:02:38.070> instead<00:02:38.670> of

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.700 
that i separate those ends instead of

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:46.690 
that i separate those ends instead of
tugging<00:02:39.150> on<00:02:39.420> them<00:02:39.690> as<00:02:39.959> I<00:02:40.470> twist

00:02:46.690 --> 00:02:46.700 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:03:01.180 

and

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:01.190 

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:04.009 

now<00:03:02.190> this<00:03:02.400> twist<00:03:02.700> may<00:03:02.879> look<00:03:03.090> a<00:03:03.209> little<00:03:03.239> puny<00:03:03.720> to

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:04.019 
now this twist may look a little puny to

00:03:04.019 --> 00:03:06.080 
now this twist may look a little puny to
you<00:03:04.170> but<00:03:04.440> remember<00:03:04.590> this<00:03:05.129> is<00:03:05.370> the<00:03:05.519> section<00:03:05.849> of

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
you but remember this is the section of

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.720 
you but remember this is the section of
my<00:03:06.269> hair<00:03:06.299> that<00:03:06.900> was<00:03:07.019> shaved<00:03:07.470> and<00:03:07.799> I<00:03:08.340> am<00:03:08.519> just

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:08.730 
my hair that was shaved and I am just

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:11.240 
my hair that was shaved and I am just
blending<00:03:09.299> that<00:03:09.330> very<00:03:09.870> short<00:03:10.200> section<00:03:10.799> in<00:03:10.950> with

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:11.250 
blending that very short section in with

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:15.589 
blending that very short section in with
hair<00:03:11.580> that<00:03:11.610> was<00:03:11.970> not<00:03:12.239> previously<00:03:12.450> cut<00:03:14.599> another

00:03:15.589 --> 00:03:15.599 
hair that was not previously cut another

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:17.750 
hair that was not previously cut another
thing<00:03:15.900> is<00:03:15.930> when<00:03:16.470> I<00:03:16.500> flat<00:03:16.950> twist<00:03:17.250> my<00:03:17.370> hair<00:03:17.610> and

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:17.760 
thing is when I flat twist my hair and

00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.850 
thing is when I flat twist my hair and
chunky<00:03:18.060> sections<00:03:18.510> I<00:03:18.629> do<00:03:18.720> not<00:03:19.049> part<00:03:19.590> with<00:03:19.680> a

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:19.860 
chunky sections I do not part with a

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:22.460 
chunky sections I do not part with a
comb<00:03:20.129> I<00:03:20.489> just<00:03:20.940> use<00:03:21.030> my<00:03:21.209> fingers<00:03:21.239> I<00:03:21.930> don't<00:03:22.319> want

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
comb I just use my fingers I don't want

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.130 
comb I just use my fingers I don't want
any<00:03:22.709> to<00:03:22.860> find<00:03:23.099> parts<00:03:23.549> showing<00:03:24.060> while<00:03:24.540> my<00:03:24.720> scalp

00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:25.140 
any to find parts showing while my scalp

00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:27.440 
any to find parts showing while my scalp
does<00:03:25.440> show<00:03:25.799> some<00:03:26.130> I<00:03:26.370> like<00:03:26.640> it<00:03:26.910> to<00:03:27.060> be<00:03:27.180> a<00:03:27.209> lot

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:27.450 
does show some I like it to be a lot

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:29.270 
does show some I like it to be a lot
more<00:03:27.480> natural-looking<00:03:28.079> whereas<00:03:29.040> you<00:03:29.250> know

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:29.280 
more natural-looking whereas you know

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.220 
more natural-looking whereas you know
I've<00:03:29.700> just<00:03:29.940> sort<00:03:30.299> of<00:03:30.329> pulled<00:03:30.630> the<00:03:30.780> hair<00:03:30.930> part

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:31.230 
I've just sort of pulled the hair part

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.229 
I've just sort of pulled the hair part
flat<00:03:31.920> twisted<00:03:32.400> it<00:03:32.489> and<00:03:32.610> the<00:03:32.760> goal<00:03:32.940> is<00:03:32.970> really

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
flat twisted it and the goal is really

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:36.170 
flat twisted it and the goal is really
to<00:03:33.360> just<00:03:33.480> a<00:03:33.690> protective<00:03:34.170> style<00:03:34.530> not<00:03:35.160> to<00:03:35.549> really

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180 
to just a protective style not to really

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:39.170 
to just a protective style not to really
get<00:03:36.450> my<00:03:36.989> hair<00:03:37.290> perfectly<00:03:38.069> parted<00:03:38.519> in<00:03:38.640> sections

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180 
get my hair perfectly parted in sections

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.619 
get my hair perfectly parted in sections
so<00:03:39.840> applying<00:03:40.470> that<00:03:40.709> serum<00:03:41.129> to<00:03:41.310> my<00:03:41.459> ends<00:03:42.000> really

00:03:42.619 --> 00:03:42.629 
so applying that serum to my ends really

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:44.420 
so applying that serum to my ends really
really<00:03:43.079> helps<00:03:43.500> to<00:03:43.680> lock<00:03:44.099> in<00:03:44.250> that<00:03:44.280> moisture

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:44.430 
really helps to lock in that moisture

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:46.430 
really helps to lock in that moisture
and<00:03:45.000> it<00:03:45.060> also<00:03:45.269> helps<00:03:45.660> with<00:03:45.690> strengthening<00:03:46.200> the

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:46.440 
and it also helps with strengthening the

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:48.199 
and it also helps with strengthening the
hair<00:03:46.680> because<00:03:47.280> the<00:03:47.400> ten-in-one<00:03:47.700> renewal

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:48.209 
hair because the ten-in-one renewal

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:52.300 
hair because the ten-in-one renewal
system<00:03:48.599> contains<00:03:49.260> biotech

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:52.310 

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:58.900 

a<00:03:56.260> bit<00:03:57.260> of<00:03:57.470> a<00:03:57.500> headache<00:03:57.739> and<00:03:58.160> what<00:03:58.580> I<00:03:58.610> do<00:03:58.700> it

00:03:58.900 --> 00:03:58.910

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430 
again no absolutely not only because i

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:06.280 
again no absolutely not only because i
don't<00:04:05.150> know<00:04:05.209> i<00:04:05.300> don't<00:04:05.540> know<00:04:05.750> this<00:04:05.989> is<00:04:06.140> going

through a phase i'm just wanted to try

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:09.850 
through a phase i'm just wanted to try
something<00:04:08.000> different<00:04:08.420> but<00:04:08.720> when<00:04:09.560> i<00:04:09.590> do<00:04:09.680> it

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:09.860
