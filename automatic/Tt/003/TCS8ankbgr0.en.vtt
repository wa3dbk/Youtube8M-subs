00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:49.219 

Shmi<00:01:38.710> ravines<00:01:44.490> chicken<00:01:45.490> but<00:01:46.090> not<00:01:46.270> too<00:01:46.420> much

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:49.229 

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:52.889 

and<00:01:50.229> I'm<00:01:50.560> using<00:01:50.740> refried<00:01:51.399> beans<00:01:51.610> I<00:01:51.909> almost<00:01:52.479> had

00:01:52.889 --> 00:01:52.899 
and I'm using refried beans I almost had

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:55.289 
and I'm using refried beans I almost had
the<00:01:53.020> thought<00:01:53.200> of<00:01:53.950> using<00:01:54.340> those<00:01:54.490> ranch<00:01:54.970> style

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:55.299 
the thought of using those ranch style

00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:56.940 
the thought of using those ranch style
beans<00:01:55.750> you<00:01:55.929> know<00:01:56.020> the<00:01:56.140> ones<00:01:56.289> in<00:01:56.439> the<00:01:56.500> black<00:01:56.679> can

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:56.950 
beans you know the ones in the black can

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.370 
beans you know the ones in the black can
but<00:01:57.700> I<00:01:58.000> thought<00:01:58.450> at<00:01:58.570> the<00:01:58.630> last<00:01:58.869> minute<00:01:59.229> I

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380 
but I thought at the last minute I

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:01.469 
but I thought at the last minute I
better<00:01:59.590> keep<00:01:59.890> it<00:02:00.070> authentic<00:02:00.159> so<00:02:01.090> here's<00:02:01.329> the

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:01.479 
better keep it authentic so here's the

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:02.100 
better keep it authentic so here's the
second<00:02:01.810> one

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.110 
second one

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:03.929 
second one
and<00:02:02.350> yeah<00:02:02.679> they're<00:02:02.920> gonna<00:02:03.009> come<00:02:03.280> out<00:02:03.399> funky

00:02:03.929 --> 00:02:03.939 
and yeah they're gonna come out funky

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:06.090 
and yeah they're gonna come out funky

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:06.100 
and looking weird but like I said I'm

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.400 
and looking weird but like I said I'm
using<00:02:06.189> tortillas<00:02:06.579> that<00:02:06.850> are<00:02:07.030> too<00:02:07.720> small<00:02:07.929> and

00:04:37.219 --> 00:04:40.419 
remember the more stuff you got in the
pan<00:04:37.459> the<00:04:38.089> colder<00:04:38.479> it's<00:04:38.659> gonna<00:04:38.869> get<00:04:39.339> and<00:04:40.339> the

00:04:40.419 --> 00:04:40.429 
pan the colder it's gonna get and the

00:04:40.429 --> 00:04:43.389 
pan the colder it's gonna get and the
colder<00:04:40.819> it<00:04:40.939> gets<00:04:41.149> the<00:04:41.569> food<00:04:42.199> starts<00:04:42.860> to<00:04:43.039> absorb

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:43.399 
colder it gets the food starts to absorb

00:04:43.399 --> 00:04:46.089 
colder it gets the food starts to absorb
the<00:04:43.580> oil<00:04:43.610> and<00:04:44.330> we<00:04:44.479> don't<00:04:44.659> want<00:04:44.839> that<00:04:44.989> so<00:04:45.259> I

00:04:46.089 --> 00:04:46.099 
the oil and we don't want that so I

00:04:46.099 --> 00:04:48.759 
the oil and we don't want that so I
think<00:04:46.729> this<00:04:47.119> is<00:04:47.300> like<00:04:47.419> a<00:04:47.479> 12-inch<00:04:48.080> skillet

00:04:48.759 --> 00:04:48.769 
think this is like a 12-inch skillet

00:04:48.769 --> 00:04:51.249 
think this is like a 12-inch skillet
so<00:04:49.249> what<00:04:49.699> are<00:04:49.759> we<00:04:49.789> got<00:04:49.939> in<00:04:49.999> there<00:04:50.089> 6<00:04:50.389> 6<00:04:50.929> is<00:04:51.050> good

00:04:51.249 --> 00:04:51.259 
so what are we got in there 6 6 is good

00:04:51.259 --> 00:04:52.719 
so what are we got in there 6 6 is good
you<00:04:51.649> don't<00:04:51.830> want<00:04:51.949> to<00:04:52.009> overcrowd<00:04:52.339> the<00:04:52.550> tummy

00:04:52.719 --> 00:04:52.729 
you don't want to overcrowd the tummy

00:04:52.729 --> 00:04:57.209 
you don't want to overcrowd the tummy
and<00:04:53.709> then<00:04:54.709> we're<00:04:54.889> just<00:04:54.919> going<00:04:55.219> to<00:04:55.279> wait<00:04:55.429> around

00:04:57.209 --> 00:04:57.219 
and then we're just going to wait around

00:04:57.219 --> 00:05:01.029 
and then we're just going to wait around
I<00:04:58.300> eat<00:04:59.300> it<00:04:59.419> up<00:04:59.539> the<00:04:59.659> pan<00:04:59.899> for<00:05:00.169> like<00:05:00.349> 10<00:05:01.009> minutes
