to add in some yellow food coloring

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.350 
to add in some yellow food coloring
because<00:01:40.920> remember<00:01:41.340> we're<00:01:41.460> making<00:01:41.549> gold<00:01:42.000> coin

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360 
because remember we're making gold coin

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.149 
because remember we're making gold coin
macaroons<00:01:42.930> and<00:01:43.500> I'm<00:01:43.619> also<00:01:43.770> going<00:01:43.979> to<00:01:44.040> add<00:01:44.130> in

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
macaroons and I'm also going to add in

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:45.770 
macaroons and I'm also going to add in
some<00:01:44.280> lemon<00:01:44.670> zest<00:01:44.700> because<00:01:45.060> it's<00:01:45.299> almost<00:01:45.600> the

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780 
some lemon zest because it's almost the

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.090 
some lemon zest because it's almost the
spring<00:01:46.079> and<00:01:46.229> that's<00:01:46.380> a<00:01:46.470> really<00:01:46.740> great<00:01:46.890> flavor

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
spring and that's a really great flavor

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.010 
spring and that's a really great flavor
for<00:01:47.399> this<00:01:47.520> time<00:01:47.700> of<00:01:47.729> year<00:01:47.850> and<00:01:48.180> then<00:01:48.689> turn<00:01:48.899> on

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
for this time of year and then turn on

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.569 
for this time of year and then turn on
your<00:01:49.140> beater<00:01:49.350> again<00:01:49.740> and<00:01:49.950> mix<00:01:50.159> in<00:01:50.310> the<00:01:50.340> color

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:50.579 
your beater again and mix in the color

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:52.670 
your beater again and mix in the color
and<00:01:50.850> the<00:01:50.939> lemon<00:01:51.240> zest<00:01:51.270> it's<00:01:52.170> best<00:01:52.380> if<00:01:52.530> you<00:01:52.619> use

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
and the lemon zest it's best if you use

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:53.870 
and the lemon zest it's best if you use
gel<00:01:52.979> color<00:01:53.220> because<00:01:53.549> it's<00:01:53.700> a<00:01:53.729> more

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:53.880 
gel color because it's a more

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.330 
gel color because it's a more
concentrated<00:01:54.240> color<00:01:54.780> and<00:01:55.110> you<00:01:55.170> use<00:01:55.380> less<00:01:55.649> this

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:56.340 
concentrated color and you use less this

00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:57.620 
concentrated color and you use less this
mix<00:01:56.579> we're<00:01:56.759> going<00:01:56.880> to<00:01:56.939> sieve<00:01:57.090> in<00:01:57.210> our<00:01:57.299> icing

00:01:57.620 --> 00:01:57.630 
mix we're going to sieve in our icing

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.600 
mix we're going to sieve in our icing
sugar<00:01:57.810> and<00:01:58.140> our<00:01:58.350> almond<00:01:58.710> meal<00:01:58.890> and<00:01:58.950> the<00:01:59.399> reason

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
sugar and our almond meal and the reason

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:00.590 
sugar and our almond meal and the reason
we<00:01:59.700> do<00:01:59.790> this<00:01:59.820> is<00:01:59.969> because<00:02:00.119> we<00:02:00.270> want<00:02:00.360> to<00:02:00.479> make

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
we do this is because we want to make

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.450 
we do this is because we want to make
sure<00:02:00.630> that<00:02:00.990> the<00:02:01.110> mix<00:02:01.320> is<00:02:01.500> really<00:02:01.740> fine<00:02:02.159> and<00:02:02.369> get

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:02.460 
sure that the mix is really fine and get

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:03.620 
sure that the mix is really fine and get
it<00:02:02.579> any<00:02:02.759> lumps<00:02:03.090> that<00:02:03.119> might<00:02:03.329> be<00:02:03.450> in<00:02:03.540> the

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
it any lumps that might be in the

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.719 
it any lumps that might be in the
almonds<00:02:04.110> we've<00:02:04.799> only<00:02:04.920> almonds<00:02:05.369> left<00:02:05.520> in<00:02:05.640> your

almonds we've only almonds left in your

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.280 
almonds we've only almonds left in your
sieve<00:02:06.000> then<00:02:06.210> you<00:02:06.270> can<00:02:06.420> save<00:02:06.600> this<00:02:06.780> music<00:02:07.110> for<00:02:07.200> a

recipe<00:02:07.990> but<00:02:08.140> don't<00:02:08.319> use<00:02:08.500> it<00:02:08.530> in<00:02:08.679> your

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:08.770 
recipe but don't use it in your

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:10.109 
recipe but don't use it in your
macaroons<00:02:09.190> because<00:02:09.490> it's<00:02:09.640> too<00:02:09.789> big<00:02:09.970> and

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:10.119 
macaroons because it's too big and

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:12.120 
macaroons because it's too big and
coarse<00:02:10.360> now<00:02:10.929> this<00:02:11.200> is<00:02:11.350> the<00:02:11.470> most<00:02:11.650> important

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.130 
coarse now this is the most important

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:13.800 
coarse now this is the most important
part<00:02:12.280> of<00:02:12.400> a<00:02:12.490> macaron<00:02:12.880> making<00:02:13.240> and<00:02:13.420> it<00:02:13.510> is<00:02:13.630> the

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:13.810 
part of a macaron making and it is the

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:16.620 
part of a macaron making and it is the
mixing<00:02:14.260> so<00:02:14.680> my<00:02:14.830> tip<00:02:15.069> to<00:02:15.250> you<00:02:15.280> is<00:02:15.610> go<00:02:16.000> slow

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:16.630 
mixing so my tip to you is go slow

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:19.410 
mixing so my tip to you is go slow
concentrate<00:02:17.560> and<00:02:17.800> count<00:02:18.340> your<00:02:18.610> mixes<00:02:19.060> and<00:02:19.239> you

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:19.420 
concentrate and count your mixes and you

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:21.300 
concentrate and count your mixes and you
shouldn't<00:02:19.750> go<00:02:19.900> wrong<00:02:20.110> just<00:02:20.860> go<00:02:21.010> around<00:02:21.100> the

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.310 
shouldn't go wrong just go around the

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.940 
shouldn't go wrong just go around the
bowl<00:02:21.459> and<00:02:21.730> continuously<00:02:22.330> and<00:02:22.569> gently<00:02:23.050> fold<00:02:23.680> in

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:23.950

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
all of your mix I like to go in the same

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:33.120 
all of your mix I like to go in the same
direction<00:02:26.640> 5<00:02:28.680> 10<00:02:30.870> 15<00:02:31.870> okay<00:02:32.500> as<00:02:32.650> you<00:02:32.800> can<00:02:32.950> see

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
direction 5 10 15 okay as you can see

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:34.949 
direction 5 10 15 okay as you can see
it's<00:02:33.370> really<00:02:33.730> thick<00:02:33.970> and<00:02:34.150> starting<00:02:34.660> to<00:02:34.780> come

00:02:34.949 --> 00:02:34.959 
it's really thick and starting to come

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:36.690 
it's really thick and starting to come
together<00:02:35.200> what<00:02:35.950> we're<00:02:36.100> going<00:02:36.280> for<00:02:36.310> is<00:02:36.520> like<00:02:36.670> a

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:36.700 
together what we're going for is like a

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.210 
together what we're going for is like a
thick<00:02:37.030> lava<00:02:37.330> type<00:02:37.780> batter<00:02:38.110> you'll<00:02:38.830> get<00:02:39.040> that

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
thick lava type batter you'll get that

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.270 
thick lava type batter you'll get that
around<00:02:39.730> maybe<00:02:40.180> 35<00:02:40.900> to<00:02:41.170> 40<00:02:41.500> mixes<00:02:41.860> it<00:02:42.010> really

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280 
around maybe 35 to 40 mixes it really

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.430 
around maybe 35 to 40 mixes it really
depends<00:02:42.760> I<00:02:42.970> know<00:02:43.269> this<00:02:43.540> is<00:02:43.630> a<00:02:43.660> lot<00:02:43.959> of<00:02:43.989> work<00:02:44.200> for

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:44.440 
depends I know this is a lot of work for

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:45.570 
depends I know this is a lot of work for
a<00:02:44.470> little<00:02:44.620> cookie<00:02:45.069> but<00:02:45.220> when<00:02:45.370> you<00:02:45.459> have

success<00:02:46.030> it's<00:02:46.269> all<00:02:46.480> worth<00:02:46.690> us<00:02:47.489> 28<00:02:48.489> you're

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
success it's all worth us 28 you're

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:50.610 
success it's all worth us 28 you're
seeing<00:02:49.450> it<00:02:49.540> now<00:02:49.569> starting<00:02:50.019> to<00:02:50.050> loosen<00:02:50.290> up<00:02:50.500> a

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:50.620 
seeing it now starting to loosen up a

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:52.440 
seeing it now starting to loosen up a
little<00:02:50.800> bit<00:02:50.980> and<00:02:51.580> get<00:02:51.790> a<00:02:51.819> little<00:02:52.030> bit<00:02:52.209> shiny

I don't go over the line of what I want
in<00:02:58.660> my<00:02:58.750> batter<00:02:59.220> 34<00:03:00.220> we're<00:03:01.090> almost<00:03:01.330> there<00:03:01.720> you

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:01.870 
in my batter 34 we're almost there you

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:03.150 
in my batter 34 we're almost there you
can<00:03:02.019> see<00:03:02.200> that<00:03:02.380> it's<00:03:02.470> a<00:03:02.530> nice<00:03:02.680> and<00:03:02.950> smooth

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:03.160 
can see that it's a nice and smooth

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.340 
can see that it's a nice and smooth
batter<00:03:03.430> it's<00:03:03.940> nice<00:03:04.150> and<00:03:04.360> shiny<00:03:04.540> and<00:03:04.780> starting

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:05.350 
batter it's nice and shiny and starting

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:11.330 
batter it's nice and shiny and starting
to<00:03:05.440> get<00:03:05.590> loose<00:03:05.860> but<00:03:06.130> it's<00:03:06.280> still<00:03:06.459> thick<00:03:09.480> 39:40

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:11.340 
to get loose but it's still thick 39:40

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.039 
to get loose but it's still thick 39:40
and<00:03:12.340> look<00:03:12.549> at<00:03:12.670> that<00:03:12.850> you<00:03:13.510> can<00:03:13.540> tell<00:03:13.810> when<00:03:13.930> it's

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:14.049 
and look at that you can tell when it's

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:15.690 
and look at that you can tell when it's
done<00:03:14.140> because<00:03:14.440> it<00:03:14.560> falls<00:03:14.799> really<00:03:15.160> slowly<00:03:15.400> off

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:15.700 
done because it falls really slowly off

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:17.699 
done because it falls really slowly off
your<00:03:15.880> spatula<00:03:16.120> and<00:03:16.630> then<00:03:16.959> when<00:03:17.110> it<00:03:17.230> lands<00:03:17.440> in

00:03:17.699 --> 00:03:17.709 
your spatula and then when it lands in

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:19.170 
your spatula and then when it lands in
the<00:03:17.739> batter<00:03:18.040> it<00:03:18.340> takes<00:03:18.579> a<00:03:18.730> little<00:03:18.910> while<00:03:19.120> to

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:19.180 
the batter it takes a little while to

00:03:19.180 --> 00:03:21.660 
the batter it takes a little while to
disappear<00:03:19.930> this<00:03:20.230> took<00:03:20.410> me<00:03:20.560> 40<00:03:20.950> stirs<00:03:21.220> the<00:03:21.489> last

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:21.670 
disappear this took me 40 stirs the last

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:23.789 
disappear this took me 40 stirs the last
time<00:03:21.820> I<00:03:21.880> made<00:03:22.030> them<00:03:22.180> it<00:03:22.269> took<00:03:22.420> me<00:03:22.540> 37<00:03:23.079> so<00:03:23.620> just

00:03:23.789 --> 00:03:23.799 
time I made them it took me 37 so just

00:03:23.799 --> 00:03:25.349 
time I made them it took me 37 so just
keep<00:03:23.950> a<00:03:24.040> close<00:03:24.250> eye<00:03:24.489> on<00:03:24.519> it<00:03:24.670> and<00:03:24.910> you<00:03:25.030> know<00:03:25.150> what

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:25.359 
keep a close eye on it and you know what

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:27.330 
keep a close eye on it and you know what
practice<00:03:25.900> makes<00:03:26.109> perfect<00:03:26.230> you<00:03:26.680> never<00:03:26.980> get<00:03:27.250> it

00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:27.340 
practice makes perfect you never get it

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:28.229 
practice makes perfect you never get it
right<00:03:27.459> the<00:03:27.609> first<00:03:27.790> time

00:03:28.229 --> 00:03:28.239

a<00:03:41.530> good<00:03:41.620> quality<00:03:41.890> thick<00:03:42.459> baking<00:03:42.910> pan<00:03:43.090> so<00:03:43.269> they

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:43.359 
a good quality thick baking pan so they

00:03:43.359 --> 00:03:45.599 
a good quality thick baking pan so they
don't<00:03:43.510> overcook<00:03:43.810> on<00:03:44.200> the<00:03:44.320> bottom<00:03:44.650> then<00:03:45.400> line

place your stencil underneath the
parchment<00:03:49.090> paper<00:03:49.239> so<00:03:49.390> you<00:03:49.540> can<00:03:49.630> pipe<00:03:49.930> directly

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:50.200 
parchment paper so you can pipe directly

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:52.620 
parchment paper so you can pipe directly
on<00:03:50.470> it<00:03:50.620> and<00:03:50.859> then<00:03:51.700> slowly<00:03:51.970> pipe<00:03:52.269> on<00:03:52.480> your

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:52.630 
on it and then slowly pipe on your

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:53.600 
on it and then slowly pipe on your
macaroons

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
macaroons

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:55.550 
macaroons
pipe<00:03:54.090> smaller<00:03:54.480> than<00:03:54.750> the<00:03:54.840> circle<00:03:55.200> so<00:03:55.320> you<00:03:55.350> give

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:55.560 
pipe smaller than the circle so you give

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.530 
pipe smaller than the circle so you give
it<00:03:55.650> room<00:03:55.770> to<00:03:55.980> spread<00:03:56.460> I<00:03:56.490> might<00:03:57.210> have<00:03:57.360> piped

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540 
it room to spread I might have piped

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.120 
it room to spread I might have piped
mine<00:03:57.750> a<00:03:57.780> little<00:03:58.080> too<00:03:58.200> big<00:03:58.440> but<00:03:58.740> they<00:03:58.830> should<00:03:59.010> be

00:03:59.120 --> 00:03:59.130 
mine a little too big but they should be

00:03:59.130 --> 00:03:59.540 
mine a little too big but they should be
okay

00:03:59.540 --> 00:03:59.550 
okay

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:01.100 
okay
when<00:03:59.940> your<00:04:00.060> macaroons<00:04:00.420> are<00:04:00.510> piped<00:04:00.720> here's<00:04:01.020> the

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:01.110 
when your macaroons are piped here's the

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:02.900 
when your macaroons are piped here's the
trick<00:04:01.320> that<00:04:01.350> I<00:04:01.530> always<00:04:01.770> forget<00:04:02.370> and<00:04:02.550> it's

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:02.910 
trick that I always forget and it's

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:04.700 
trick that I always forget and it's
banging<00:04:03.300> your<00:04:03.420> tray<00:04:03.660> against<00:04:04.080> the<00:04:04.170> countertop

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:04.710 
banging your tray against the countertop

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:06.770 
banging your tray against the countertop
to<00:04:04.830> get<00:04:04.950> any<00:04:05.250> air<00:04:05.460> bubbles<00:04:05.850> just<00:04:06.060> give<00:04:06.660> it<00:04:06.750> one

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:06.780 
to get any air bubbles just give it one

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:08.870 
to get any air bubbles just give it one
or<00:04:06.990> two<00:04:07.020> quick<00:04:07.320> bangs<00:04:07.590> a<00:04:07.890> next<00:04:08.490> important<00:04:08.850> step

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880 
or two quick bangs a next important step

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:10.670 
or two quick bangs a next important step
is<00:04:09.030> letting<00:04:09.420> the<00:04:09.480> macaroons<00:04:09.870> dry<00:04:10.110> out<00:04:10.290> at<00:04:10.500> room

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
is letting the macaroons dry out at room

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.200 
is letting the macaroons dry out at room
temperature<00:04:10.710> for<00:04:11.250> around<00:04:11.550> half<00:04:11.790> an<00:04:12.030> hour<00:04:12.120> of

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:12.210 
temperature for around half an hour of

00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:14.450 
temperature for around half an hour of
40<00:04:12.570> minutes<00:04:12.750> until<00:04:13.080> the<00:04:13.470> top<00:04:13.560> of<00:04:13.770> them<00:04:14.040> kind<00:04:14.400> of

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:14.460 
40 minutes until the top of them kind of

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:16.460 
40 minutes until the top of them kind of
dries<00:04:14.730> out<00:04:15.030> and<00:04:15.330> doing<00:04:15.570> this<00:04:15.870> it<00:04:16.080> will<00:04:16.200> create

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:16.470 
dries out and doing this it will create

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:17.870 
dries out and doing this it will create
those<00:04:16.709> lovely<00:04:16.890> little<00:04:17.070> feet<00:04:17.430> so<00:04:17.580> if<00:04:17.640> you<00:04:17.670> have
