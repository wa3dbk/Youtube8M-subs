 try 120 team is showing tune 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:28.810
 It will be off when we show 

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:30.370
 how far fps is going will apply to 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.700
 play a little bit to show you 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:37.030
 the machine running during our tests 

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:39.670
 in the wall a time she hardly 

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:42.430
 was below 40 species is in 

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.800
 average was in 40 and 50 species 

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:48.160
 the dollar here will be playing now a 

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:51.090
 to show you that there are 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.090
 difference in 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:11.430
 4550 fps button on knife when playing well 

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:11.430
 another new thing 

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:24.460
 play well is I never have anyone in 

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:27.070
 track only mona fact do what we 

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:30.150
 You only have to set up a computer, you do not have to 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:30.150
 stay in training will play 

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:42.040
 let's test and then we could do it all 

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:47.290
 then I saw that 27 fps do one more time 

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:49.710
 just to see how it is is that the 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:54.370
 recommended is over 30 fps to play 

00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:57.520
 football is not yet running in 

00:03:54.370 --> 00:04:01.080
 machine and 7 tiger two was got a r 

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:07.000
 980 x and is in everything in the other glow and 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:09.790
 when it was between 4 34 and one more 

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.810
 play to see how you walk by 

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:19.710
 map and run to see how it is 

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:19.710
 This map is in conquest mode. 

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:27.110
 the people are talking there to ask 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:30.139
 to test with the ghost town code 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:31.040
 We're going to make a video with others. 

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:32.660
 games, right? 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:34.340
 only in the moment of tension in the club until 

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:36.139
 the end of four because it is a game of 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:38.750
 time is the heaviest we jow 

00:04:36.139 --> 00:04:40.430
 saw running around ok then is what most 

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:42.710
 requires marketing 

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:44.810
 everyone asks the dash is everyone wants 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:46.930
 see the brief for running understood the 

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:50.690
 It will make others with the other 

00:04:46.930 --> 00:04:52.700
 games but as it is with many requests 

00:04:50.690 --> 00:04:54.830
 to deliver I 'm not afraid to stay 

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:58.130
 testing a lot with game point gives 

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:59.960
 time to play and b4 and show good 

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:02.479
 to you how is the performance of 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:04.970
 of the machine 

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:08.690
 looks so I'm playing here was 

00:05:04.970 --> 00:05:11.180
 with the tank at an increase of 47 ps 35 

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:14.260
 36 and died 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:17.389
 52 but it stays on this track of the album never 

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:19.910
 has reached 60 fps and is no longer 

00:05:17.389 --> 00:05:24.740
 Yes, then, but on average it gets 

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:26.720
 50 super cool super cool tá 

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:30.020
 I know you want to have a powerful machine 

00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:32.720
 at home playing high lipstick 24 any 

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:38.660

 if you want to customize the machine 

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:46.460
 you can add a request also one 

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:50.840

 I want to put more card reader in 

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:53.840
 any card reader puts in 

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:57.350
 However, a fashion request for you 

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:59.510

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:01.580
 in the upper part places a request that
