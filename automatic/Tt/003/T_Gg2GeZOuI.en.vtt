mean even though he was a star in his
own<00:02:02.939> right<00:02:03.000> and<00:02:03.479> could<00:02:04.350> lead<00:02:04.680> a<00:02:04.710> band<00:02:05.040> and

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:08.690 
own right and could lead a band and
could<00:02:05.579> could<00:02:06.090> could<00:02:06.119> do<00:02:06.810> his<00:02:07.020> own<00:02:07.110> thing<00:02:07.700> when

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:08.700 
could could could do his own thing when

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:10.369 
could could could do his own thing when
it<00:02:08.879> came<00:02:09.030> time<00:02:09.330> to<00:02:09.390> him<00:02:09.780> to<00:02:09.959> play<00:02:10.170> behind

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:10.379 
it came time to him to play behind

00:02:10.379 --> 00:02:12.309 
it came time to him to play behind
another<00:02:11.090> Muse

00:02:12.309 --> 00:02:12.319 
another Muse

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:15.759 
another Muse
I<00:02:12.620> think<00:02:13.099> by<00:02:13.400> far<00:02:14.140> he<00:02:15.140> was<00:02:15.260> probably<00:02:15.469> one<00:02:15.709> of

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:15.769 
I think by far he was probably one of

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:17.830 
I think by far he was probably one of
the<00:02:15.890> best<00:02:16.069> at<00:02:16.310> it<00:02:16.489> I<00:02:16.670> think<00:02:17.180> junior<00:02:17.390> wealth<00:02:17.659> was

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
the best at it I think junior wealth was

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.599 
the best at it I think junior wealth was
very<00:02:18.019> good<00:02:18.260> at<00:02:18.379> it

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:19.609 
very good at it

00:02:19.609 --> 00:02:21.670 
very good at it
but<00:02:19.909> I<00:02:19.939> think<00:02:20.269> little<00:02:21.049> walnut<00:02:21.260> was<00:02:21.500> just

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:21.680 
but I think little walnut was just

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.209 
but I think little walnut was just
brilliant<00:02:22.280> at<00:02:22.400> playing<00:02:22.730> behind<00:02:23.060> other<00:02:23.209> other
