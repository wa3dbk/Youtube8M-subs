controlled environment motion capture
works<00:03:38.580> because<00:03:38.970> it<00:03:39.000> can<00:03:39.269> see<00:03:39.480> what<00:03:39.630> the<00:03:39.750> actors

00:03:39.979 --> 00:03:39.989 
works because it can see what the actors

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:41.240 
works because it can see what the actors
are<00:03:40.140> doing<00:03:40.470> and<00:03:40.590> when<00:03:40.709> you're<00:03:40.830> shooting<00:03:40.980> in<00:03:41.190> a

really<00:03:43.319> tricky<00:03:44.040> so<00:03:44.280> we<00:03:44.850> have<00:03:45.090> to<00:03:45.239> specially

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:45.660 
really tricky so we have to specially

detail of the actors performances and

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.080 
detail of the actors performances and
then<00:04:04.620> they're<00:04:04.769> tracking<00:04:05.040> that<00:04:05.340> detail<00:04:05.790> into

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:06.090 
then they're tracking that detail into

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:09.229 
then they're tracking that detail into
these<00:04:06.540> photorealistic<00:04:07.440> eight<00:04:08.040> models<00:04:08.580> the

these photorealistic eight models the

help<00:04:11.549> on<00:04:11.670> this<00:04:11.790> film<00:04:12.060> was<00:04:12.299> the<00:04:12.510> actual<00:04:12.780> active

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:13.350 
help on this film was the actual active

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:15.530 
help on this film was the actual active
body<00:04:13.799> marker<00:04:14.160> strands<00:04:14.579> and<00:04:14.730> so<00:04:15.269> you<00:04:15.329> could

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:15.540 
body marker strands and so you could

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.390 
body marker strands and so you could
velcro<00:04:16.200> that<00:04:16.410> to<00:04:16.590> the<00:04:16.680> performers<00:04:17.130> you<00:04:17.310> know

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:17.400 
velcro that to the performers you know

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:18.770 
velcro that to the performers you know
and<00:04:17.609> they<00:04:17.789> could<00:04:17.940> roll<00:04:18.090> around<00:04:18.120> they<00:04:18.600> could

00:04:18.770 --> 00:04:18.780 
and they could roll around they could

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:20.420 
and they could roll around they could
fight<00:04:19.079> they<00:04:19.320> could<00:04:19.500> do<00:04:19.739> all<00:04:19.829> the<00:04:19.950> active<00:04:20.220> stuff

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:20.430 
fight they could do all the active stuff

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:25.300 
fight they could do all the active stuff
that<00:04:20.579> they<00:04:20.669> need<00:04:20.880> to<00:04:20.970> do<00:04:21.120> as<00:04:21.269> Apes

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:25.310 

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:28.340 

then<00:04:26.310> really<00:04:26.940> a<00:04:26.970> lot<00:04:27.270> of<00:04:27.450> it<00:04:27.540> just<00:04:27.750> comes<00:04:27.960> into

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:28.350 
then really a lot of it just comes into

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:30.050 
then really a lot of it just comes into
