00:00:05.439 --> 00:00:08.930
 ah 

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:10.520
 good afternoon, I'm Miguel Rodríguez 

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:13.910
 technical engineer the company of veros 

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:16.130
 mogán and let's explain what is the 

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:18.020
 blonde mob here we have a bullet of 

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:21.350
 blonde peat usually comes in this 

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:25.160
 compact format 

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:27.530
 for use in nurseries and large gardens 

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:30.529
 other larger formats are used 

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:32.090
 up to 5 cubic meters 

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:35.120
 well the peat is a material that 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:37.670
 comes from the decomposition of 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:40.309
 wood and forests in very hot climates 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:42.950
 cold and very humid normally 

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:46.550
 this comes from Baltic countries of 

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:49.090
 Germany and countries so they had the 

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.090
 lake 

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:54.870
 with a lot of organic matter and during a 

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:58.289
 very long time process of hundreds 

00:00:54.870 --> 00:01:01.170
 of years this substrate is created that 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:03.839
 it is called peat peat we have two types 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.600
 of the blonde and the black one the most 

00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:09.899
 usually use is the blonde because it's worth 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.240
 to give structure to our soil in 

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:15.810
 the black grave is a peat more 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:18.420
 mineralized more made and what we 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.280
 contributes is let's say more fertilizer the 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.979
 plants in this type of substrates we 

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:24.179
 it's worth to create structures which 

00:01:21.979 --> 00:01:26.970
 we must be careful with this 

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:29.340
 substrate with peat in the southern zone of 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:32.670
 Gran Canaria and in very dry areas and with 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:36.330
 low humidity because it is material that 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:38.490
 it can dry out or lose its 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.890
 structure and its capacity for retention 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.470
 of water some we have observed as in 

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:46.679
 some pots are the areas that are 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:48.479
 outside this material dries up and 

00:01:46.679 --> 00:01:50.459
 then for a lot of water that we give to the 

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.490
 plant to pot the water 

00:01:50.459 --> 00:01:57.119
 he ends it by releasing 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:59.970
 without the plant is to subtract the liquid from 

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.979
 she then has to mix it with the 

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:04.530
 lands or with substrates but have 

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:08.250
 careful not to overdo it because 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:11.760
 has that little flaw that in the area 

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.920
 more with a more intense sun that can be 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.450
 resect and lose all that structure that 

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:16.769
 we believe that we pretend that is what 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.330
 we intend to create because with this what 

00:02:16.769 --> 00:02:21.330
 we intend to create is a good 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:23.340
 structure to all that substrate that is 

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.849
 It can be lost if used in 

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.849
 excess
