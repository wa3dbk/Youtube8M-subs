00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:34.559 
three to four weeks that's what it is

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:36.770 
three to four weeks that's what it is
exactly<00:00:35.160> and<00:00:35.399> so<00:00:35.730> your<00:00:36.149> option<00:00:36.480> is<00:00:36.600> this

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
exactly and so your option is this

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.720 
exactly and so your option is this
mostly<00:00:37.410> gray<00:00:37.739> hair<00:00:37.980> starts<00:00:38.370> around<00:00:38.579> the

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730 
mostly gray hair starts around the

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.450 
mostly gray hair starts around the

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
temples the front hairline and the part

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.729 
temples the front hairline and the part

00:00:43.729 --> 00:00:43.739 
that's where it's mostly exposed to Sun

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:45.049 
that's where it's mostly exposed to Sun

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 
cover it is to do some lighter colors

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:52.910 
cover it is to do some lighter colors
around<00:00:51.210> the<00:00:51.300> face<00:00:51.570> that'll<00:00:52.350> blend<00:00:52.559> the<00:00:52.739> gray

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
around the face that'll blend the gray

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.680 
around the face that'll blend the gray
coming<00:00:53.160> in<00:00:53.399> around<00:00:53.550> the<00:00:53.789> face<00:00:54.030> and<00:00:54.059> directly

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:54.690 
coming in around the face and directly

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.299 
coming in around the face and directly
around<00:00:54.870> your<00:00:55.199> hairline<00:00:55.379> and<00:00:55.800> your<00:00:55.920> part<00:00:56.129> line

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
around your hairline and your part line

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:58.970 
around your hairline and your part line
and<00:00:56.550> then<00:00:57.090> use<00:00:57.570> some<00:00:57.840> Brown<00:00:58.170> lowlights<00:00:58.680> to

00:00:58.970 --> 00:00:58.980 
and then use some Brown lowlights to

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.950 
and then use some Brown lowlights to
blend<00:00:59.219> throughout<00:00:59.609> the<00:00:59.820> back<00:01:00.059> so<00:01:00.420> that<00:01:00.449> you

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:00.960 
blend throughout the back so that you

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:03.470 
blend throughout the back so that you
diffuse<00:01:01.649> the<00:01:02.309> intensity<00:01:02.910> of<00:01:03.030> the<00:01:03.120> highlights

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
diffuse the intensity of the highlights

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.539 
diffuse the intensity of the highlights
and<00:01:03.690> lowlights<00:01:04.019> and<00:01:04.470> the<00:01:04.860> gray<00:01:05.040> hair<00:01:05.339> so

00:01:05.539 --> 00:01:05.549 
and lowlights and the gray hair so

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:07.730 
and lowlights and the gray hair so
you're<00:01:05.670> basically<00:01:06.180> using<00:01:06.420> all<00:01:07.110> the<00:01:07.500> tones

00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:07.740 
you're basically using all the tones

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:09.500 
you're basically using all the tones
that<00:01:07.860> are<00:01:07.979> already<00:01:08.340> present<00:01:08.549> in<00:01:08.820> your<00:01:08.939> hair<00:01:09.150> to

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
that are already present in your hair to

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:10.940 
that are already present in your hair to
highlight<00:01:09.840> and<00:01:09.990> low-light<00:01:10.290> with<00:01:10.500> and<00:01:10.710> then

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:10.950 
highlight and low-light with and then

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:13.580 
highlight and low-light with and then
blend<00:01:11.280> it<00:01:11.430> out<00:01:11.549> because<00:01:12.270> natural<00:01:13.170> hair<00:01:13.380> is

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:13.590 
blend it out because natural hair is

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.320 
blend it out because natural hair is
lighter<00:01:13.920> around<00:01:14.250> the<00:01:14.340> face<00:01:14.580> and<00:01:14.760> on<00:01:15.000> the<00:01:15.119> top

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
lighter around the face and on the top

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.030 
lighter around the face and on the top
layer<00:01:15.570> and<00:01:15.630> then<00:01:16.080> darker<00:01:16.500> throughout<00:01:16.830> the

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
layer and then darker throughout the

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.710 
layer and then darker throughout the
back<00:01:17.250> so<00:01:17.820> that's<00:01:17.909> kind<00:01:18.180> of<00:01:18.210> how<00:01:18.330> you<00:01:18.390> want<00:01:18.570> to

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
back so that's kind of how you want to

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:19.940 
back so that's kind of how you want to
mimic<00:01:18.869> it<00:01:19.170> with<00:01:19.320> the<00:01:19.439> highlights<00:01:19.770> and

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
mimic it with the highlights and

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:21.679 
mimic it with the highlights and
lowlights<00:01:20.070> when<00:01:20.520> you're<00:01:20.640> blending<00:01:20.909> gray<00:01:21.390> hair

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
lowlights when you're blending gray hair

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.200 
lowlights when you're blending gray hair
with<00:01:22.110> some<00:01:22.380> natural<00:01:22.560> Brown<00:01:23.009> left<00:01:23.340> I<00:01:23.700> like<00:01:24.060> the

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
with some natural Brown left I like the

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:25.550 
with some natural Brown left I like the
concept<00:01:24.420> oh<00:01:24.869> well<00:01:25.080> you<00:01:25.170> said<00:01:25.380> with<00:01:25.470> the

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
concept oh well you said with the

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.890 
concept oh well you said with the
lighter<00:01:25.799> around<00:01:26.040> here<00:01:26.520> because<00:01:26.900> naturally

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
lighter around here because naturally

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.289 
lighter around here because naturally
that<00:01:28.049> gray<00:01:28.350> pops<00:01:28.740> through<00:01:29.189> it's<00:01:29.939> the<00:01:30.030> first

00:01:30.289 --> 00:01:30.299 
that gray pops through it's the first

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:31.760 
that gray pops through it's the first
thing<00:01:30.509> when<00:01:30.659> someone<00:01:30.990> looks<00:01:31.170> at<00:01:31.320> you<00:01:31.470> and<00:01:31.650> when

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
thing when someone looks at you and when

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.249 
thing when someone looks at you and when
you're<00:01:31.950> using<00:01:32.100> a<00:01:32.340> lighter<00:01:32.610> color<00:01:33.000> it<00:01:33.750> reflects

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:34.259 
you're using a lighter color it reflects

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:36.620 
you're using a lighter color it reflects
it<00:01:34.500> diffuses<00:01:35.130> it<00:01:35.250> you<00:01:35.369> don't<00:01:35.549> camouflage<00:01:36.210> it

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630 
it diffuses it you don't camouflage it

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.319 
it diffuses it you don't camouflage it
you<00:01:37.049> don't<00:01:37.229> see<00:01:37.290> it<00:01:37.500> you<00:01:38.159> know<00:01:38.280> so<00:01:38.520> like<00:01:38.790> crisp

00:01:39.319 --> 00:01:39.329 
you don't see it you know so like crisp

00:01:39.329 --> 00:01:42.020
