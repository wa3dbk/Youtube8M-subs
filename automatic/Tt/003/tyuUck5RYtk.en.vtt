00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:23.779 
airport the waste attached you designed
this<00:00:22.529> battery<00:00:22.920> has<00:00:23.279> compared<00:00:23.580> to<00:00:23.640> other

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:23.789 
this battery has compared to other

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:25.250 
this battery has compared to other
batteries<00:00:24.180> that<00:00:24.630> they<00:00:24.750> focused<00:00:25.140> on

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
batteries that they focused on

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.250 
batteries that they focused on
portability<00:00:26.180> so<00:00:27.180> the<00:00:27.300> casing<00:00:27.630> is<00:00:27.689> very<00:00:27.900> slim

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:28.260 
portability so the casing is very slim

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.310 
portability so the casing is very slim
very<00:00:29.160> narrow<00:00:29.460> and<00:00:29.730> all<00:00:30.720> the<00:00:30.840> functions<00:00:31.199> are

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:31.320 
very narrow and all the functions are

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.470 
very narrow and all the functions are
grouped<00:00:31.500> to<00:00:31.590> get<00:00:31.710> in<00:00:31.830> one<00:00:31.980> section<00:00:32.390> so<00:00:33.390> you

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
grouped to get in one section so you

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:34.940 
grouped to get in one section so you
won't<00:00:33.570> be<00:00:33.690> confused<00:00:33.840> about<00:00:34.170> what<00:00:34.440> function<00:00:34.860> is

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
won't be confused about what function is

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.420 
won't be confused about what function is
