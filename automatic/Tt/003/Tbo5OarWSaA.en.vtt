00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.600
 hello and welcome to 

00:00:01.069 --> 00:00:04.600
 gamescom 2013 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:22.640
 because already on class 

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.699
 2013 will be on wednesday today 

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:30.710
 Press Day 

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:32.450
 We'll have a look for you today 

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.340
 couple of games and I would say that 

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:35.410
 Do not talk for long but go straight away 

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.180
 purely 

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:41.120
 so will report back from assassin's 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:44.420
 creed 4 black flag the game itself 

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:48.559
 super successful the fighting scenes are good 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:50.870
 the graphics are great and yes man 

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:51.739
 starts on a ship around a harbor 

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.769
 take 

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:56.180
 you have to destroy this one so two 

00:00:54.769 --> 00:00:58.159
 destroying protected towers 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:00.260
 After that you have to go to the harbor for yourself 

00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:02.689
 ingest with his krutmann kills 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.580
 officer and then you come in 

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:07.040
 a room purely just a movie scene 

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:09.799
 where you start with the harbor 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:14.479
 owner speaks and so is it 

00:01:09.799 --> 00:01:16.340
 already the playtime has passed me by 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:18.159
 Assassin's creed definitely liked 

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:21.049
 I will definitely buy it 

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:23.659
 Unfortunately, saving can not say much about that 

00:01:21.049 --> 00:01:26.630
 therefore the predecessor unfortunately does not know 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:30.100
 and I would say something as we say 

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.100
 us back from the next game 

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:46.050
 we will be back from state of here 

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:48.570
 we're just starting to play a lot 

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.920
 awesome game it is almost three again 

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:53.660
 years are new things 

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.660
 Added to it like superpowers 

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.969
 I think a cooler mission is for everyone 

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:00.079
 case cool i will definitely 

00:01:57.969 --> 00:02:02.630
 We buy a few scenes 

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:04.819
 unfortunately I play well recorded 

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.859
 so far bad because it is console but 

00:02:04.819 --> 00:02:08.440
 we will be on the computer 

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:11.150
 most likely also a let's play 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.680
 do together and you can do that 

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:16.040
 you already look forward and I'll tell you 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:17.750
 for the next game on a new day 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.400
 the gamescom is thursday 

00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.810
 we were an hour earlier purely 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.760
 before all the other people go inside 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.430
 Of course we were allowed to have the time 

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.200
 used to have run to diablo 3 

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.870
 Diablo 3 played unfortunately is fragrance 

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:31.549
 not film-it's is 

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:34.190
 this is an extension of diablo 3 

00:02:31.549 --> 00:02:37.190
 report souls called this comes the 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:38.840
 crusader a new class it looks quite 

00:02:37.190 --> 00:02:41.120
 alright she was not able to do any of her skills 

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:44.269
 all test because the time was too short 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.829
 one was allowed only a short mission 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:48.920
 Playing in the city in a city 

00:02:45.829 --> 00:02:50.470
 starts the haunted by ghosts 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:54.560
 becomes 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:55.750
 you have to take two ghosts heap 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.160
 remove 

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:59.690
 and if you did that, that is 

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:04.400
 demo already over or 

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:06.200
 the play of phase I like diablo 3 

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.480
 quite well the processes have already 

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:11.030
 I probably would be played too 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.459
 but pick at a later time 

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.389
 if it's a bit cheaper and 

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:15.049
 I would say we'll see each other 

00:03:14.389 --> 00:03:18.910
 next game 

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:18.910
 I do not know what the locksmith
