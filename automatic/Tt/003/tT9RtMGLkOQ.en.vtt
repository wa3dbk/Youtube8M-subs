00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.660
 Now welcome to another video more than 

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:10.270
 comment my name is juan and the day of 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:12.280
 Today I will not dance because I saw the 

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:16.660
 annoyed that he will dance the day of the premiere 

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:18.910
 a tutorial about hair we are going to 

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:21.599
 comb how we see now our nothing 

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:21.599
 hairstyle 

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:26.320
 the only thing I did was like bathing 

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:29.230
 dry my hair and what we're going to 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:31.900
 to do is a hairstyle that he made with harold 

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:33.879
 that is very much in trend 

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:36.489
 Well, I had been in a trend for a while 

00:00:33.879 --> 00:00:38.520
 but we've never done structural here 

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:41.559
 like all the fashion and fashion channels 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:44.620
 hair style they have then they 

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:46.540
 I live this tutorial wii the study 

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:48.430
 how I need to know how to accommodate 

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:50.620
 These styles according to our hair like 

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:54.219
 you can see right now I have more or less 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:56.469
 here long and short of the sides in 

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:59.649
 reality total route so short is more or 

00:00:56.469 --> 00:01:01.180
 less like 22 and a half that's as 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:03.579
 I have the hair then so that 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:04.570
 you more or less see the tutorial what 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:07.990
 which one here 

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:10.540
 as you are going to use today 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:13.600
 a product that they sent us from 

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:16.660
 london is the tweet in which we 

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:20.290
 they sent several various products we have 

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:23.170
 the amateur laser ointment and the normal silk 

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:25.060
 that we are going to use this to comb 

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:27.310
 embroidered on how the style is a bit more 

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:30.130
 structured I recommend you to use 

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:32.200
 the ointment because the ointment usually 

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:34.390
 has much more difficult fixations 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.310
 of hair loss compared to 

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:38.289
 please the will be more of then let's 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.240
 use these do you have any doubt the 

00:01:38.289 --> 00:01:42.340
 product from where you can buy it 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:44.229
 I will leave the links here below can 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.570
 be followed by 30 and must be done 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:47.979
 products for boys and not for girls 

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:50.440
 because sometimes you can put that the 

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:52.119
 steel of the breast and therefore the truth 

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.100
 women have the same structure as 

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:56.050
 we have a little that 

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:57.789
 see a lot thicker then I'll 

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:59.560
 I recommend here below I 'm going to leave you the 

00:01:57.789 --> 00:02:03.390
 link and as I said we are going to save 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.390
 smoked and we started 

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:13.590
 it's an amber color we're going to need 

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:16.410
 like two fingers of smoked apply in 

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.900
 our hand and we're going to put it like that and what 

00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:21.420
 what we are going to do next is to 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:24.030
 distribute it well in our hands a 

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.830
 basic bit that I grab on what in 

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:28.110
 actually this what we're going to do nothing 

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:31.460
 more to try to distribute since 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:34.460
 our hands are so full of ointment 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:38.570
 now we are going to put rich let's put 

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:41.060
 on the hair very well distributed and 

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:46.270
 they fix what is like a kind like 

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:50.230
 of cap and I'm passing the product 

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:50.230
 slowly 

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:59.050
 I do not remember them until the root because that 

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:01.420
 can plug our capillary pores the 

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:03.489
 commas that are good automatically give 

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:06.430
 a lot of structure to our hair 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:09.040
 we do not really need like others 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:11.440
 products now that I'm in very good 

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:14.440
 fixing and this pen really has 

00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:17.260
 very good fixation and what I'm 

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:20.379
 doing is like modeling and going on 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:23.080
 little by little the rubber now with the help 

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:26.200
 of a comb we are going to look for and for example 

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:29.170
 I play the part of this part 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:32.860
 So what we are going to look for is where 

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:35.079
 it ends up like the most short hair and it 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:38.200
 start then long that is our 

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:41.190
 match and we will try to comb towards 

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.190
 the side 

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:48.510
 all to the side 

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:53.750
 since we have the match done from the side 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:56.930
 let's start 

00:03:53.750 --> 00:04:00.050
 to do a little bit backwards and then what 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:03.530
 what we are going to do is how to mark here 

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:05.360
 well the match and then for example this 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:06.590
 part that remains here what we are going to 

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:09.800
 do is 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:14.390
 upload it a little 

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:18.609
 let's go climbing little by little it sets 

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:21.239
 little by little we are going to accommodate 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:21.239
 backwards 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:34.729
 you feel that you have a little bit of 

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:37.550
 product in the hair what are we going to 

00:04:34.729 --> 00:04:40.810
 do is apply it on the sides so that 

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:40.810
 do not move anything 

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:46.330
 a little bit the sides and in the ribs 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:51.270
 and that style is super simple 

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:52.890
 of hair the truth to this mega easy 

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:55.560
 see what it takes us to control our mind 

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:56.970
 we were not absolutely anything that 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:59.670
 you have to check the lengths of your 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:01.590
 hair and what is your cut more or less 

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:04.470
 I stayed like this is a super hairstyle 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:06.169
 fast it actually looks super super 

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:07.969
 all right 

00:05:06.169 --> 00:05:09.620
 I recommend you use this sidewalk 

00:05:07.969 --> 00:05:11.300
 because in reality how could they be given 

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:14.560
 super fast structures account 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:14.560
 we need something else 

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:29.430
 and that was all life I 'm going to leave 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:32.400
 the data so that you ask for it will be 

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:34.919
 down here for our blog also by 

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:37.650
 there and our social networks if they 

00:05:34.919 --> 00:05:40.229
 liked the cut of the like it station its 

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:42.090
 version of this style of hairstyle by 

00:05:40.229 --> 00:05:43.260
 please sue the photographs this was 

00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:45.590
 all on the one hand we see the 

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:45.590
 next
