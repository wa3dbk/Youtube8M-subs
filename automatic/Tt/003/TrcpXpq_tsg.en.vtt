00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:19.000
 It is a Nikon genuine stereo microphone 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:22.080
 It called me 1 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.080
 It is an external microphone 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:28.440
 And this is 8 Sony 

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.789
 Video camera 

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:35.190

 Well If you are installing this kind of external persons 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:41.340
 In the case of that Sony a little special form 

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:47.250
 That positive 

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:52.310
 It is the central 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:52.310
 It is adapter to be able to use even product except Sony 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.590
 I bought this at Lower Japan 

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:04.890
 At first we think that we want to open from one of the microphones 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:04.890
 By 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:12.990

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:38.270
 Microphone 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.270
 It is a great compact- 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:46.220
 With this, it is the place where you are really worried about Luka that the sound is really wide . 

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.750
 Ah 

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:49.750

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.120
 Microphone bag 

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:01.940
 Such a cute drawstring bag 

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:10.110
 It is a guy to prevent the wind noise after 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:14.390
 Something has become a little turf 

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:31.230
 When I will use this again Maoh 8 Itozaki 4 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:33.920
 We think that we want to review after that about how much we can prevent 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:33.920
 this is 

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:47.430
 I was addicted 

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:50.560
 It is like this 

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:52.920
 That's it- 

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.920
 Yup 

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:58.500
 If you make it so much 

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:01.580
 That simple 

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:01.580
 It has been making 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:06.610
 Here's a flood and low cut 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:15.360
 Well Toka wind noise When you Well low-cut that it is outdoors 

00:03:13.249 --> 00:03:18.670
 It seems to be able to reduce 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:21.120
 Maa usually flat 

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:21.120
 Isn't it 

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:32.660
 Let's attach it to a SLR camera 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:35.680
 It is single-lens reflex camera d 300 s 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:41.519
 In here 

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:41.519
 I removed it first because it has a cover 

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:46.710
 Plug in here 

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:50.230
 To the child of 

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:58.520
 The spot got caught and tighten the screws 

00:03:55.410 --> 00:03:58.520
 If fixed 

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:06.330
 It's a bit long and it's a bit long so I'm going to roll around here 

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:07.390
 Mike's boy at 

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:10.140
 Of here 

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:10.140
 Pakka and 

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:16.680
 There is a microphone in the middle of the alp 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.680
 there 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:22.389
 I will put on a win 

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.560
 The power from here is 

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:25.560
 It seems to take you 

00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:31.690
 How is it good ? 

00:04:33.449 --> 00:04:40.990
 Well 

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:43.650
 Prima facie Nikon genuine Audio-Technica also as a product of comparison Well I'd have to mono 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:43.650
 No 

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:52.220
 Yeah emergency hospital force 

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:55.720
 That's a little longer, but some people have a sign 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:55.720
 How does the productivity I feel 

00:04:56.639 --> 00:05:06.439
 I think it's different cool if you enter from the form 

00:04:59.969 --> 00:05:06.439
 Well, after all I was attracted to that this compact and Nikon genuine 

00:05:08.249 --> 00:05:15.420
 It was a little fun to take a video with this a little 

00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:21.990
 In the Well, a single-lens reflex it'd be perfumed 

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:25.190
 Well, I usually use the Sony Handycam when I take a video . 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:25.190
 I would like to 

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:35.800
 Sony Handycam cx 560 v 

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:38.060
 It always comes with that on- vehicle video 

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:44.600
 You are or take 

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:46.430
 Well this microphone that can record the genuine cat's shop channel is very good though 

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:49.849
 Well by all means 

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:55.240
 It will wind personable care 

00:05:49.849 --> 00:06:00.009
 Take the after Ne-board video in the car driver 

00:05:55.240 --> 00:06:02.770
 After a throat from the inside of the camera 

00:06:00.009 --> 00:06:07.460
 It's a chatty sound 

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:14.000
 I'm trembling is something not a I feel it 's chatter 

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:18.470
 Such strange noises come in , and there is a little by putting on that external type microphone. 

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:23.680
 I think it can be reduced 

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:23.680
 As I said earlier in the case of Sony 

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:29.620
 Good 

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:34.630
 The shape here is special, so unique 

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:37.600
 It's not that generic 

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:40.350
 Make these Lords usable 

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:40.350
 Adapter is 

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:43.289
 It becomes this 

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:51.449
 Really like this 

00:06:48.249 --> 00:06:51.449
 It is such a small thing 

00:06:51.569 --> 00:06:54.110
 this 

00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:00.320
 Win and 

00:06:59.110 --> 00:07:01.909
 Already 

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:04.119
 It was fit smoothly 

00:07:01.909 --> 00:07:04.119
 so 

00:07:11.169 --> 00:07:15.990
 Mike is here 

00:07:14.430 --> 00:07:17.880
 Open 

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:20.300
 In the place where you mic 

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:20.300
 With the suspension 

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:25.880
 It became such a shape 

00:07:26.470 --> 00:07:34.140
 It was introduction of genuine stereo microphone me 1 more than now
