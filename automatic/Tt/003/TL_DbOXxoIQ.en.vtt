00:00:00.709 --> 00:00:07.379
 Good guys, it's a good afternoon, good morning, good morning. 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:10.950
 Late night, you're watching this 

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:13.620
 video and I decided to make this video here 

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:17.490
 because it's been a while since I've been 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:20.869
 looking for a bomb go to the pack 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:23.699
 foods to be able to freeze is because the 

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:25.980
 oxygen helps to ruin the 

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:31.080
 food and if you pack the cow 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:33.300
 It lasts longer and it 's an expensive thing, right? 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.570
 vacuum pump is expensive to fuck you 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:38.969
 pick up a refrigerator engine has problem 

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:42.719
 Oil had your trip then I found a 

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:45.930
 Tip there to make my vacuum with a 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:50.520
 Well, my block compressor is that 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:52.710
 that loose varziela only that I did not find 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.719
 no description also to do with 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:57.449
 any bombinho see that the boy got 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:59.100
 there a specific bomb that he 

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:01.949
 was able to adapt but not 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.559
 I could do it for others and like me 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:07.890
 I found his bomb I tried to do 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:09.900
 an adaptation right here and as I 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.750
 I searched a lot I did not think it was legal 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.900
 put this video on youtube 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:18.600
 the people who like to play gambiarra 

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.220
 see how you can make a good deal 

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:24.240
 is this I picked up a firecracker of 

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:30.360
 any watercolor line is that the 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:33.210
 air outlet here is traditional and 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.979
 happens when you take out the screws 

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:38.159
 here and open it 

00:01:34.979 --> 00:01:43.350
 it has a very simple system inside the 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:49.950
 engine is vibrating on top of a 

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:52.079
 only that the air intake does not 

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:54.470
 It's very specific I could not find 

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:57.600
 direct air intake 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:02:00.270
 the idea was to analyze the air intake 

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.579
 to make the vacuum I did good she 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:06.509
 pulls air from somewhere in the 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:09.840
 stay inside it I did I made one 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:14.700
 hole here that entry did not exist 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:16.739
 grandson made a hole here with the right drill 

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.500
 After opening it, she made a 

00:02:16.739 --> 00:02:22.530
 hole I placed this little 

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:25.500
 truth is a little piece of 

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.150
 home irrigation coming from the kitchen 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.459
 for connection 

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:33.450
 This pectin she has a tip here 

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:36.840
 It has a thread breaking rice that there is a 

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.489
 pvc pipe and here you have one out 

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.319
 saidinha very simple in that here it is 

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:43.040
 super cheap do not know the price should be 

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:43.040
 cents 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:52.440
 I found the piece was right, I saw it. 

00:02:49.019 --> 00:02:54.720
 she who with pvc pipe glue and 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:59.120
 time to close the bomb 

00:02:54.720 --> 00:03:02.090
 I tried to pass pvc glue on all the 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:04.799
 regions where water could enter 

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:06.660
 including where it passes the wire to 

00:03:04.799 --> 00:03:09.930
 not have put up is the danger 

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:14.040
 reboxetine boxing around the whole 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:16.590
 plug the wire here and put the 

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.510
 pvc around everything everything put that 

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:22.709
 even the screws on her little foot 

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:26.220
 I put it inside with the pvc glue and 

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:29.010
 I closed the experiment and glued it dry. 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:30.810
 It works that's a beauty for you to see. 

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:32.639
 here it works well 

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:44.440
 I'm going to take a test here and here 

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:46.630
 connected to the outlet any 

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.810
 the same stapler can be any 

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:48.810
 thing 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:53.170
 this mangueirinha mangueirinha de 

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:58.030
 aquarium even personal uses here for the 

00:03:53.170 --> 00:04:03.180
 ffa pride referee is just put in the 

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:03.180
 Sachet Closes Here 

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:12.720
 She makes a boat that has already reached the water. 

00:04:18.910 --> 00:04:22.860
 there o 

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:24.210
 a very good vacuum if you have 

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:27.000
 patience to wait a little longer 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:30.510
 She's going to force you even more, go if you 

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:32.310
 Watch out, come on, the bomb looks pretty cool. 

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:33.840
 There are people who like to use this here. 

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:35.910
 To do cartridge refill, I 

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:39.540
 I believe that it should serve also is easy 

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:41.160
 so I did not test but the cow 

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:43.669
 I think it's enough to pull ink 

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.669
 of the cartridge 

00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:48.449
 That's it. I hope it helped you. 

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:51.030
 I wanted to invite the people who do 

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:53.310
 Gambiarra there people puts the gambiarras 

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:56.010
