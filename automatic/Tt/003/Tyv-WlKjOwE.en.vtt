00:01:53.389 --> 00:01:53.399 
this up particularly though in the UK

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.190 
this up particularly though in the UK
because<00:01:53.579> I've<00:01:53.820> had<00:01:54.030> such<00:01:54.210> a<00:01:54.240> hard<00:01:54.600> time<00:01:54.780> trying

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
because I've had such a hard time trying

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.160 
because I've had such a hard time trying
to<00:01:55.320> get<00:01:55.500> this<00:01:55.590> game<00:01:55.939> now<00:01:56.939> it<00:01:57.600> kind<00:01:57.810> of<00:01:57.840> leads<00:01:57.990> me

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
to get this game now it kind of leads me

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.240 
to get this game now it kind of leads me
on<00:01:58.290> to<00:01:58.320> sort<00:01:58.680> of<00:01:58.740> what<00:01:58.860> we've<00:01:58.979> talked<00:01:59.189> about

00:01:59.240 --> 00:01:59.250 
on to sort of what we've talked about

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.330 
on to sort of what we've talked about
before<00:01:59.399> this<00:02:00.210> whole<00:02:00.450> idea<00:02:00.810> of<00:02:00.869> you<00:02:01.799> know<00:02:01.950> are

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
before this whole idea of you know are

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.100 
before this whole idea of you know are
we<00:02:02.610> going<00:02:02.850> towards<00:02:03.180> more<00:02:03.360> digital<00:02:03.719> downloads

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:04.110 
we going towards more digital downloads

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.740 
we going towards more digital downloads
now<00:02:04.320> it's<00:02:04.560> an<00:02:04.649> interesting<00:02:04.950> point<00:02:05.399> that<00:02:05.759> we've

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:06.750 
now it's an interesting point that we've

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:08.240 
now it's an interesting point that we've
talked<00:02:07.020> before<00:02:07.140> about<00:02:07.320> how<00:02:07.469> publishers<00:02:07.920> maybe

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:08.250 
talked before about how publishers maybe

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:09.440 
talked before about how publishers maybe
would<00:02:08.429> want<00:02:08.610> to<00:02:08.729> go<00:02:08.849> down<00:02:09.030> that<00:02:09.060> route<00:02:09.300> because

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:09.450 
would want to go down that route because

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:10.850 
would want to go down that route because
it<00:02:09.690> may<00:02:09.780> be<00:02:09.840> more<00:02:10.080> sort<00:02:10.319> of<00:02:10.349> financially

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860 
it may be more sort of financially

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.440 
it may be more sort of financially
viable<00:02:11.039> for<00:02:11.430> them<00:02:11.550> or<00:02:11.879> they<00:02:11.970> just<00:02:12.000> want<00:02:12.270> to<00:02:12.360> go

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
viable for them or they just want to go

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:13.380 
viable for them or they just want to go
that<00:02:12.569> way<00:02:12.629> in<00:02:12.900> general

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
that way in general

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.240 
that way in general
anyway<00:02:13.780> maybe<00:02:14.260> because<00:02:14.560> it<00:02:14.650> will<00:02:14.770> stop<00:02:14.950> people

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:15.250 
anyway maybe because it will stop people

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:16.830 
anyway maybe because it will stop people
kind<00:02:15.430> of<00:02:15.550> doing<00:02:16.000> the<00:02:16.060> whole<00:02:16.210> pre-owned<00:02:16.540> thing

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:16.840 
kind of doing the whole pre-owned thing

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.449 
kind of doing the whole pre-owned thing
or<00:02:16.960> sharing<00:02:17.290> titles<00:02:17.680> means<00:02:18.040> more<00:02:18.190> money<00:02:18.220> for

00:02:18.449 --> 00:02:18.459 
or sharing titles means more money for

00:02:18.459 --> 00:02:21.449 
or sharing titles means more money for
them<00:02:18.760> and<00:02:18.940> but<00:02:19.780> it's<00:02:19.959> say<00:02:20.590> it's<00:02:20.770> curious<00:02:21.190> that

00:02:21.449 --> 00:02:21.459 
them and but it's say it's curious that

00:02:21.459 --> 00:02:23.520 
them and but it's say it's curious that
actually<00:02:22.330> it<00:02:22.420> seems<00:02:22.569> to<00:02:22.750> be<00:02:22.840> the<00:02:22.930> economy

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:23.530 
actually it seems to be the economy

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:25.170 
actually it seems to be the economy
that's<00:02:23.860> pushing<00:02:24.310> this<00:02:24.430> rather<00:02:24.819> than

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:25.180 
that's pushing this rather than

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:27.210 
that's pushing this rather than
publishers<00:02:25.840> just<00:02:26.050> their<00:02:26.170> own<00:02:26.290> ideals<00:02:26.740> the

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.220 
publishers just their own ideals the

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:29.070 
publishers just their own ideals the
fact<00:02:27.459> that<00:02:27.550> these<00:02:27.940> sort<00:02:28.240> of<00:02:28.330> retailers<00:02:28.780> are

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:29.080 
fact that these sort of retailers are

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.680 
fact that these sort of retailers are
closing<00:02:29.530> down<00:02:29.560> I<00:02:30.010> mean<00:02:30.340> game<00:02:30.580> and<00:02:30.850> HMV<00:02:31.360> about

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:31.690 
closing down I mean game and HMV about

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.420 
closing down I mean game and HMV about
being<00:02:31.870> an<00:02:31.959> administration<00:02:32.740> and<00:02:32.920> now<00:02:33.280> they

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:33.430 
being an administration and now they

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.760 
being an administration and now they
can't<00:02:33.610> even<00:02:33.850> get<00:02:34.000> stopped<00:02:34.390> to<00:02:34.600> sell<00:02:34.870> so<00:02:35.440> and

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:35.770 
can't even get stopped to sell so and

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:36.780 
can't even get stopped to sell so and
this<00:02:35.830> has<00:02:36.010> been<00:02:36.040> a<00:02:36.190> problem<00:02:36.370> that's<00:02:36.520> happened

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.790 
this has been a problem that's happened

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:37.860 
this has been a problem that's happened
before<00:02:36.910> remember<00:02:37.330> when<00:02:37.420> I<00:02:37.480> trying<00:02:37.660> to<00:02:37.690> pick<00:02:37.810> up

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:37.870 
before remember when I trying to pick up

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:41.310 
before remember when I trying to pick up
SSX<00:02:38.470> EA<00:02:38.950> would<00:02:39.250> not<00:02:39.400> provide<00:02:39.840> hmv<00:02:40.840> with<00:02:40.989> stock

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:41.320 
SSX EA would not provide hmv with stock

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:42.540 
SSX EA would not provide hmv with stock
because<00:02:41.530> they<00:02:41.770> didn't<00:02:41.980> have<00:02:42.070> any<00:02:42.220> faith<00:02:42.430> that

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:42.550 
because they didn't have any faith that

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:43.530 
because they didn't have any faith that
they<00:02:42.670> were<00:02:42.730> actually<00:02:42.790> able<00:02:43.060> to<00:02:43.209> sell<00:02:43.390> the

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:43.540 
they were actually able to sell the

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.380 
they were actually able to sell the
titles<00:02:43.959> etc<00:02:44.140> etc<00:02:44.500> so<00:02:45.000> you<00:02:46.000> know<00:02:46.120> what<00:02:46.270> do<00:02:46.330> you

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
titles etc etc so you know what do you

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:47.430 
titles etc etc so you know what do you
think<00:02:46.570> about<00:02:46.630> that<00:02:46.810> is<00:02:47.050> that<00:02:47.080> really<00:02:47.410> bad

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440 
think about that is that really bad

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.800 
think about that is that really bad
thing<00:02:47.860> is<00:02:47.950> a<00:02:47.980> good<00:02:48.190> thing<00:02:48.340> personally<00:02:48.850> myself

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
thing is a good thing personally myself

00:03:25.259 --> 00:03:25.269 
and pick things up from but maybe I'm a

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:26.520 
and pick things up from but maybe I'm a
bit<00:03:25.420> old-fashioned<00:03:25.959> not<00:03:26.079> like<00:03:26.170> to<00:03:26.320> browse

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:26.530 
bit old-fashioned not like to browse

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:28.590 
bit old-fashioned not like to browse
through<00:03:26.860> the<00:03:26.950> games<00:03:27.190> you<00:03:27.700> know<00:03:27.850> but<00:03:28.360> I<00:03:28.390> say

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:28.600 
through the games you know but I say

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:29.789 
through the games you know but I say
maybe<00:03:28.810> that's<00:03:28.989> a<00:03:29.049> bit<00:03:29.170> of<00:03:29.260> an<00:03:29.320> old<00:03:29.440> fashioned

00:03:29.789 --> 00:03:29.799 
maybe that's a bit of an old fashioned

00:03:29.799 --> 00:03:31.140 
maybe that's a bit of an old fashioned
point<00:03:29.980> of<00:03:30.070> view<00:03:30.250> but<00:03:30.640> when<00:03:30.790> it<00:03:30.880> comes<00:03:31.030> to

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:31.150 
point of view but when it comes to

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.630 
point of view but when it comes to
digital<00:03:31.329> downloads<00:03:31.930> I<00:03:32.079> mean<00:03:32.230> that<00:03:33.220> in<00:03:33.310> itself

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:33.640 
digital downloads I mean that in itself

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.580 
digital downloads I mean that in itself
is<00:03:33.790> not<00:03:33.940> necessarily<00:03:34.420> the<00:03:34.720> best<00:03:35.079> way<00:03:35.290> to<00:03:35.350> go<00:03:35.500> at

00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:35.590 
is not necessarily the best way to go at

00:03:35.590 --> 00:03:36.960 
is not necessarily the best way to go at
the<00:03:35.650> moment<00:03:35.680> look<00:03:36.040> at<00:03:36.160> the<00:03:36.220> PSN<00:03:36.610> store<00:03:36.640> I'm

00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:36.970 
the moment look at the PSN store I'm

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:38.370 
the moment look at the PSN store I'm
sure<00:03:37.120> it's<00:03:37.209> the<00:03:37.269> same<00:03:37.329> with<00:03:37.480> Xbox<00:03:37.840> Live<00:03:38.110> and

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:38.380 
sure it's the same with Xbox Live and

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:40.410 
sure it's the same with Xbox Live and
when<00:03:39.040> you<00:03:39.190> try<00:03:39.220> to<00:03:39.459> buy<00:03:39.730> games<00:03:40.030> from<00:03:40.209> there

when you try to buy games from there

00:03:40.420 --> 00:03:42.210 
when you try to buy games from there
they're<00:03:40.720> often<00:03:41.019> 10<00:03:41.260> to<00:03:41.410> 12<00:03:41.650> pounds<00:03:41.829> more

they're often 10 to 12 pounds more

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:44.819 
they're often 10 to 12 pounds more
expensive<00:03:42.880> than<00:03:43.750> they<00:03:43.959> are<00:03:44.110> in<00:03:44.380> the<00:03:44.560> shops

00:03:44.819 --> 00:03:44.829 
expensive than they are in the shops

00:03:44.829 --> 00:03:46.440 
expensive than they are in the shops
because<00:03:45.160> of<00:03:45.459> the<00:03:45.549> way<00:03:45.670> that<00:03:45.850> those<00:03:46.090> are<00:03:46.299> sort

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:46.450

maybe<00:03:49.780> they'll<00:03:49.959> just<00:03:50.110> always<00:03:50.320> be<00:03:50.650> that

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:50.829 
maybe they'll just always be that

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:53.009 
maybe they'll just always be that
expensive<00:03:51.510> and<00:03:52.510> obviously<00:03:52.720> there's<00:03:52.989> the

and it sort of I think it just adds to
the<00:04:26.889> kind<00:04:27.069> of<00:04:27.099> general<00:04:27.400> downward<00:04:27.759> spiral<00:04:28.240> we

experiencing when it comes to these
stores<00:04:29.889> and<00:04:30.129> the<00:04:30.190> kind<00:04:30.370> of<00:04:30.490> staffing<00:04:31.090> that's
