it's also a basking spot but they can

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:44.150 
it's also a basking spot but they can
bask<00:02:40.440> at<00:02:42.140> this<00:02:43.140> is<00:02:43.290> a<00:02:43.320> real<00:02:43.590> branch<00:02:43.890> right<00:02:44.100> here

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:44.160 
bask at this is a real branch right here

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.890 
bask at this is a real branch right here
I<00:02:44.520> found<00:02:45.300> outside

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:45.900 
I found outside

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:49.610 
I found outside
it<00:02:46.770> goes<00:02:47.040> up<00:02:47.600> it's<00:02:48.600> about<00:02:48.660> 4<00:02:49.140> feet<00:02:49.320> tall<00:02:49.560> I

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:49.620 
it goes up it's about 4 feet tall I

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:54.080 
it goes up it's about 4 feet tall I
think<00:02:50.010> yep<00:02:50.760> and<00:02:51.690> then<00:02:51.900> he<00:02:51.989> goes<00:02:52.110> up<00:02:52.380> to<00:02:53.090> 2nd

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:54.090 
think yep and then he goes up to 2nd

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:55.300 
think yep and then he goes up to 2nd
platform<00:02:54.540> which<00:02:54.720> is<00:02:54.840> right<00:02:55.020> here

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
platform which is right here

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:26.170 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:30.250 

this<00:03:27.170> is<00:03:27.380> a<00:03:27.410> power<00:03:28.310> son<00:03:28.730> microwave<00:03:29.540> bulb<00:03:29.900> so<00:03:30.140> if

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:30.260 
this is a power son microwave bulb so if

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:36.700 
this is a power son microwave bulb so if
it's<00:03:30.470> of<00:03:33.130> UVB<00:03:34.630> UVA<00:03:35.630> and<00:03:35.900> heat<00:03:36.110> all<00:03:36.290> in<00:03:36.500> one

it's of UVB UVA and heat all in one

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:41.080 
it's of UVB UVA and heat all in one
keeps<00:03:37.490> the<00:03:37.610> temperatures<00:03:38.060> perfect<00:03:40.060> we<00:03:41.060> have

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
keeps the temperatures perfect we have

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:44.980 
keeps the temperatures perfect we have
some<00:03:41.420> ventilation<00:03:41.960> of<00:03:42.020> course<00:03:42.320> which<00:03:42.950> is<00:03:43.990> and
