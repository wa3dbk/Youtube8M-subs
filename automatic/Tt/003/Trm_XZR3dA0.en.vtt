but when you pull guys you don't need a
pivot<00:01:11.740> foot<00:01:11.890> okay<00:01:12.190> so<00:01:12.400> you're<00:01:12.550> not<00:01:12.580> going<00:01:12.820> to

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:12.880 
pivot foot okay so you're not going to

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.120 
pivot foot okay so you're not going to
be<00:01:12.970> standing<00:01:13.390> still<00:01:13.720> and<00:01:14.380> throwing<00:01:14.830> it<00:01:14.920> off<00:01:15.010> to

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:15.130 
be standing still and throwing it off to

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:16.560 
be standing still and throwing it off to
the<00:01:15.190> other<00:01:15.340> team<00:01:15.580> so<00:01:15.850> when<00:01:16.000> you<00:01:16.030> want<00:01:16.270> to<00:01:16.330> use

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:16.570 
the other team so when you want to use

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:18.570 
the other team so when you want to use
is<00:01:17.020> you<00:01:17.140> want<00:01:17.320> to<00:01:17.380> use<00:01:17.500> your<00:01:17.620> momentum<00:01:17.800> to

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:18.580 
is you want to use your momentum to

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:20.580 
is you want to use your momentum to
generate<00:01:19.060> a<00:01:19.090> lot<00:01:19.300> of<00:01:19.330> force<00:01:19.450> going<00:01:19.930> forward

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:20.590 
generate a lot of force going forward

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.230 
generate a lot of force going forward
and<00:01:21.010> that's<00:01:21.220> going<00:01:21.430> to<00:01:21.520> crease<00:01:21.729> your<00:01:21.850> your

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:22.240 
and that's going to crease your your

and that's going to crease your your
distance<00:01:22.690> the<00:01:23.260> one<00:01:23.440> thing<00:01:23.620> I<00:01:23.710> do<00:01:23.770> want<00:01:24.040> to<00:01:24.070> talk

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:28.450 
routine every single time when you pull

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:30.300 
routine every single time when you pull
if<00:01:28.960> you<00:01:29.049> look<00:01:29.200> at<00:01:29.320> basketball<00:01:29.799> players<00:01:30.070> shoot

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:30.310

free throws

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:32.789 
free throws
you<00:01:31.180> look<00:01:31.330> like<00:01:31.390> golfers<00:01:31.930> they're<00:01:32.500> gonna<00:01:32.620> make

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:32.799 
you look like golfers they're gonna make

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:34.710 
you look like golfers they're gonna make
a<00:01:32.830> play<00:01:32.890> they<00:01:33.580> do<00:01:33.640> the<00:01:33.820> same<00:01:34.119> exact<00:01:34.630> thing

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:34.720 
a play they do the same exact thing

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.530 
a play they do the same exact thing
every<00:01:35.290> single<00:01:35.470> time<00:01:35.650> you<00:01:36.549> shouldn't<00:01:36.880> walk<00:01:37.299> up

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:37.540 
every single time you shouldn't walk up

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:39.510 
every single time you shouldn't walk up
to<00:01:37.659> the<00:01:37.750> line<00:01:38.020> and<00:01:38.350> not<00:01:38.710> understand<00:01:39.250> what

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.520 
to the line and not understand what

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.609 
to the line and not understand what
you're<00:01:39.640> gonna<00:01:39.760> do<00:01:39.970> have<00:01:40.869> the<00:01:40.990> same<00:01:41.229> routine

00:01:41.609 --> 00:01:41.619 
you're gonna do have the same routine

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:44.250 
you're gonna do have the same routine
every<00:01:41.830> single<00:01:42.310> time<00:01:42.430> before<00:01:42.610> you<00:01:42.880> pull<00:01:43.260> all

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:44.260 
every single time before you pull all

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:45.690 
every single time before you pull all
right<00:01:44.409> from<00:01:44.590> my<00:01:44.710> approach<00:01:45.040> I<00:01:45.220> like<00:01:45.400> to<00:01:45.520> get

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700 
right from my approach I like to get

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.640 
right from my approach I like to get
about<00:01:45.850> 10<00:01:46.150> yards<00:01:46.360> or<00:01:46.659> so<00:01:46.869> away<00:01:47.020> from<00:01:47.170> the<00:01:47.380> line

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:47.650 
about 10 yards or so away from the line

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:49.890 
about 10 yards or so away from the line
we're<00:01:48.189> going<00:01:48.280> to<00:01:48.340> use<00:01:48.490> this<00:01:48.670> disc<00:01:49.030> that's<00:01:49.630> kind

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:49.900 
we're going to use this disc that's kind

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.660 
we're going to use this disc that's kind
of<00:01:49.960> a<00:01:50.049> marker<00:01:50.470> for<00:01:50.500> where<00:01:50.920> line<00:01:51.220> would<00:01:51.460> be<00:01:51.610> so

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
of a marker for where line would be so

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:52.859 
of a marker for where line would be so
we<00:01:51.909> don't<00:01:52.060> have<00:01:52.150> a<00:01:52.210> line<00:01:52.390> out<00:01:52.540> here<00:01:52.570> on<00:01:52.780> this

00:01:52.859 --> 00:01:52.869 
we don't have a line out here on this

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:55.289 
we don't have a line out here on this
field<00:01:52.960> you<00:01:53.799> want<00:01:53.950> to<00:01:54.100> get<00:01:54.250> in<00:01:54.430> a<00:01:54.520> good<00:01:54.729> spot<00:01:55.060> you

able<00:01:59.320> to<00:01:59.470> generate<00:01:59.740> a<00:01:59.799> lot<00:01:59.890> of<00:02:00.070> force<00:02:00.189> and

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:00.610 
able to generate a lot of force and

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:02.310 
able to generate a lot of force and
movement<00:02:01.000> going<00:02:01.150> forward<00:02:01.630> and<00:02:01.900> if<00:02:02.170> you're

00:02:09.359 --> 00:02:09.369 
good nice spot I like about 10 yards 15

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:10.619 
good nice spot I like about 10 yards 15
yards<00:02:09.399> something<00:02:09.909> like<00:02:10.000> that<00:02:10.179> right<00:02:10.390> here

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:10.629 
yards something like that right here

00:02:10.629 --> 00:02:13.380 
yards something like that right here
okay<00:02:11.319> now<00:02:12.010> what<00:02:12.819> I<00:02:12.849> like<00:02:13.120> to

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:13.390 
okay now what I like to

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:15.660 
okay now what I like to
I<00:02:13.420> really<00:02:13.840> like<00:02:13.990> to<00:02:14.110> call<00:02:14.380> myself<00:02:14.650> down<00:02:15.220> okay

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:15.670 
I really like to call myself down okay

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:17.840 
I really like to call myself down okay
just<00:02:16.330> like<00:02:16.540> if<00:02:16.690> you're<00:02:16.810> going<00:02:16.870> to<00:02:17.050> lift<00:02:17.230> and

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
just like if you're going to lift and

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:21.059 
just like if you're going to lift and
weightlifting<00:02:19.260> you<00:02:20.260> do<00:02:20.380> a<00:02:20.410> lot<00:02:20.650> of<00:02:20.770> breathing

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:21.069 
weightlifting you do a lot of breathing

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:22.410 
weightlifting you do a lot of breathing
exercises<00:02:21.190> to<00:02:21.760> really<00:02:21.970> kind<00:02:22.150> of<00:02:22.209> calm

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:22.420 
exercises to really kind of calm

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:24.150 
exercises to really kind of calm
yourself<00:02:22.780> down<00:02:22.990> before<00:02:23.200> you<00:02:23.590> exert<00:02:23.890> a<00:02:23.920> lot<00:02:24.100> of

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
yourself down before you exert a lot of

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.720 
yourself down before you exert a lot of
force

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:24.730 
force

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:26.820 
force
so<00:02:25.180> my<00:02:25.390> routine<00:02:25.840> what<00:02:25.959> I<00:02:26.050> do<00:02:26.110> is<00:02:26.319> I<00:02:26.440> stand<00:02:26.709> like

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:26.830 
so my routine what I do is I stand like

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:29.160 
so my routine what I do is I stand like
this<00:02:27.160> I<00:02:27.400> take<00:02:28.060> three<00:02:28.390> deep<00:02:28.660> breaths

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:29.170 
this I take three deep breaths

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:34.740 
this I take three deep breaths
so<00:02:29.319> I<00:02:31.290> lose<00:02:32.290> my<00:02:32.530> whole<00:02:32.740> body<00:02:32.980> and<00:02:33.630> then<00:02:34.630> when

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
so I lose my whole body and then when

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.199 
so I lose my whole body and then when
I'm<00:02:34.900> ready<00:02:34.930> I<00:02:35.470> step<00:02:36.220> back<00:02:36.430> on<00:02:36.730> with<00:02:36.910> my<00:02:37.000> right

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:37.209 
I'm ready I step back on with my right

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:40.320 
I'm ready I step back on with my right
foot<00:02:37.240> and<00:02:37.810> then<00:02:38.709> I<00:02:38.830> go<00:02:39.100> into<00:02:39.310> my<00:02:39.520> approach<00:02:39.880> okay

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:40.330 
foot and then I go into my approach okay

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.809 
foot and then I go into my approach okay
and<00:02:40.570> basically<00:02:41.050> it<00:02:41.739> doesn't<00:02:42.160> matter<00:02:42.370> exactly

00:02:42.809 --> 00:02:42.819 
and basically it doesn't matter exactly

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:45.030 
and basically it doesn't matter exactly
what<00:02:43.090> you<00:02:43.420> do<00:02:43.630> you<00:02:44.200> just<00:02:44.230> want<00:02:44.680> to<00:02:44.739> be<00:02:44.830> doing

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:45.040 
what you do you just want to be doing

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:47.070 
what you do you just want to be doing
something<00:02:45.190> the<00:02:45.700> same<00:02:45.910> time<00:02:46.239> over<00:02:46.540> and<00:02:46.840> over

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:47.080 
something the same time over and over

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.740 
something the same time over and over
and<00:02:47.200> that's<00:02:47.350> what<00:02:47.560> I<00:02:47.590> do<00:02:48.209> now<00:02:49.209> talking<00:02:49.510> about

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
and that's what I do now talking about

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:52.560 
and that's what I do now talking about
the<00:02:50.020> footwork<00:02:50.410> as<00:02:50.620> I<00:02:50.980> approach<00:02:51.340> the<00:02:51.370> line<00:02:51.820> okay

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:52.570 
the footwork as I approach the line okay

00:02:52.570 --> 00:02:54.720 
the footwork as I approach the line okay
the<00:02:53.019> one<00:02:53.230> thing<00:02:53.410> we<00:02:53.530> want<00:02:53.620> to<00:02:53.739> focus<00:02:53.920> on<00:02:54.280> is

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:54.730 
the one thing we want to focus on is

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:56.759 
the one thing we want to focus on is
we're<00:02:55.030> generating<00:02:55.480> more<00:02:55.930> and<00:02:55.989> more<00:02:56.230> speed<00:02:56.530> as

00:02:56.759 --> 00:02:56.769 
we're generating more and more speed as

00:02:56.769 --> 00:02:58.620 
we're generating more and more speed as
we<00:02:56.950> get<00:02:57.070> close<00:02:57.340> to<00:02:57.370> the<00:02:57.519> line<00:02:57.880> and<00:02:58.209> then<00:02:58.510> when

00:02:58.620 --> 00:02:58.630 
we get close to the line and then when

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:01.140 
we get close to the line and then when
we<00:02:58.720> get<00:02:58.959> to<00:02:59.200> we're<00:02:59.380> about<00:02:59.410> to<00:02:59.860> pull<00:03:00.160> we<00:03:00.790> stop

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:01.150 
we get to we're about to pull we stop

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.020 
we get to we're about to pull we stop
and<00:03:01.420> we<00:03:01.480> explode<00:03:02.260> all<00:03:02.560> that<00:03:02.769> force<00:03:03.070> okay<00:03:03.489> so

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:04.030 
and we explode all that force okay so

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:05.640 
and we explode all that force okay so
what<00:03:04.150> I<00:03:04.209> mean<00:03:04.360> by<00:03:04.510> that<00:03:04.570> is<00:03:04.900> when<00:03:05.019> I<00:03:05.110> get<00:03:05.350> close

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.650 
what I mean by that is when I get close

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:08.850 
what I mean by that is when I get close
to<00:03:05.680> the<00:03:05.920> line<00:03:06.190> I<00:03:06.580> stop<00:03:07.390> right<00:03:07.720> here<00:03:08.380> and<00:03:08.739> I

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:08.860 
to the line I stop right here and I

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.120 
to the line I stop right here and I
explode<00:03:09.340> all<00:03:09.610> that<00:03:09.790> force<00:03:10.060> forward<00:03:10.989> the<00:03:11.980> other

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:12.130 
explode all that force forward the other

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:14.550 
explode all that force forward the other
thing<00:03:12.430> I<00:03:12.519> want<00:03:12.700> to<00:03:12.790> talk<00:03:12.970> about<00:03:13.200> it's<00:03:14.200> kind<00:03:14.470> of

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:14.560 
thing I want to talk about it's kind of

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:16.949 
thing I want to talk about it's kind of
opening<00:03:15.010> up<00:03:15.160> your<00:03:15.310> hips<00:03:15.580> to<00:03:16.300> get<00:03:16.420> that<00:03:16.600> extra

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:16.959 
opening up your hips to get that extra

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:19.380 
opening up your hips to get that extra
rotation<00:03:17.680> which<00:03:18.220> will<00:03:18.400> allow<00:03:18.549> you<00:03:18.610> to<00:03:18.730> pull<00:03:19.239> it

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:19.390 
rotation which will allow you to pull it

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:21.960 
rotation which will allow you to pull it
farther<00:03:19.690> what<00:03:20.680> I<00:03:20.739> mean<00:03:20.890> by<00:03:21.010> that<00:03:21.040> is<00:03:21.340> as<00:03:21.549> I<00:03:21.700> walk

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:21.970 
farther what I mean by that is as I walk

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.660 
farther what I mean by that is as I walk
to<00:03:22.209> the<00:03:22.239> line<00:03:22.739> if<00:03:23.739> I<00:03:23.799> was<00:03:23.950> going<00:03:24.130> to<00:03:24.220> go<00:03:24.310> in<00:03:24.430> slow

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:24.670 
to the line if I was going to go in slow

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:27.360 
to the line if I was going to go in slow
motion<00:03:25.320> my<00:03:26.320> left<00:03:26.680> foot<00:03:26.950> if<00:03:27.160> I'm<00:03:27.310> a

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
motion my left foot if I'm a

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.060 
motion my left foot if I'm a
right-handed<00:03:27.579> polar<00:03:28.120> my<00:03:28.750> left<00:03:29.049> foot<00:03:29.320> is<00:03:30.010> going

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.070 
right-handed polar my left foot is going

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:33.330 
right-handed polar my left foot is going
to<00:03:30.340> do<00:03:30.459> kind<00:03:30.640> of<00:03:30.820> backwards<00:03:31.420> cross<00:03:31.980> cross<00:03:32.980> step

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:33.340 
to do kind of backwards cross cross step

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.000 
to do kind of backwards cross cross step
so<00:03:33.579> I'm<00:03:33.670> going<00:03:33.820> to<00:03:33.850> go<00:03:33.970> backwards<00:03:34.690> here<00:03:35.170> which

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.010 
so I'm going to go backwards here which

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:38.069 
so I'm going to go backwards here which
really<00:03:36.220> allows<00:03:36.579> me<00:03:36.610> to<00:03:36.910> open<00:03:37.060> up<00:03:37.600> my<00:03:37.660> whole

00:03:38.069 --> 00:03:38.079 
really allows me to open up my whole

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:41.100 
really allows me to open up my whole
side<00:03:38.350> and<00:03:38.620> this<00:03:38.680> is<00:03:38.739> my<00:03:39.220> last<00:03:39.430> move<00:03:39.790> and<00:03:40.180> then<00:03:40.870> I

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:41.110 
side and this is my last move and then I

00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:43.530 
side and this is my last move and then I
take<00:03:41.320> my<00:03:41.350> right<00:03:41.709> foot<00:03:42.100> and<00:03:42.130> come<00:03:42.610> through<00:03:42.640> and

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:43.540 
take my right foot and come through and

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:45.750 
take my right foot and come through and
now<00:03:44.110> I<00:03:44.140> can<00:03:44.530> generate<00:03:44.920> all<00:03:45.130> that<00:03:45.310> power

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:45.760 
now I can generate all that power

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:49.020 
now I can generate all that power
if<00:03:46.209> you<00:03:46.480> come<00:03:46.780> straight<00:03:47.140> forward<00:03:47.530> like<00:03:48.160> this

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:49.030 
if you come straight forward like this

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:53.550 
if you come straight forward like this
and<00:03:49.780> go<00:03:49.989> to<00:03:50.049> pull<00:03:51.510> you<00:03:52.510> can<00:03:52.660> see<00:03:52.959> that<00:03:53.170> my<00:03:53.290> hips

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:53.560 
and go to pull you can see that my hips

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:55.380 
and go to pull you can see that my hips
are<00:03:53.829> pointing<00:03:54.459> towards<00:03:54.790> my<00:03:54.880> target<00:03:55.150> it's

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:55.390 
are pointing towards my target it's

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:57.270 
are pointing towards my target it's
really<00:03:55.630> hard<00:03:55.870> to<00:03:55.959> be<00:03:56.079> in<00:03:56.110> turn<00:03:56.380> so<00:03:57.160> it's

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280 
really hard to be in turn so it's

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.030 
really hard to be in turn so it's
important<00:03:57.760> to<00:03:57.790> get<00:03:57.940> back<00:03:58.150> cross<00:03:58.560> okay<00:03:59.560> so<00:03:59.620> I<00:03:59.860> go

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:00.040 
important to get back cross okay so I go

00:04:00.040 --> 00:04:03.990 
important to get back cross okay so I go
here<00:04:00.430> I<00:04:00.640> cross<00:04:01.360> that<00:04:01.660> back<00:04:02.340> open<00:04:03.340> up<00:04:03.430> my<00:04:03.640> hips

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:04.000 
here I cross that back open up my hips

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.180 
here I cross that back open up my hips
and<00:04:04.420> then<00:04:04.540> when<00:04:04.690> I<00:04:04.720> pull<00:04:05.110> I<00:04:05.410> have<00:04:05.829> that<00:04:06.010> much

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:06.190 
and then when I pull I have that much

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:08.940 
and then when I pull I have that much
more<00:04:06.340> leverage<00:04:06.880> to<00:04:06.910> get<00:04:07.239> the<00:04:07.720> disc<00:04:07.930> going<00:04:08.320> far

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:08.950 
more leverage to get the disc going far

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:09.770 
more leverage to get the disc going far
down<00:04:09.160> the<00:04:09.310> field

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
down the field

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.479 
down the field
now<00:04:10.780> she<00:04:11.109> talked<00:04:11.530> about<00:04:11.560> the<00:04:11.859> motion<00:04:12.280> of<00:04:12.370> the

00:04:12.479 --> 00:04:12.489 
now she talked about the motion of the

00:04:12.489 --> 00:04:15.390 
now she talked about the motion of the
pole<00:04:12.730> when<00:04:13.510> I<00:04:13.540> come<00:04:13.840> into<00:04:14.019> it<00:04:14.320> why<00:04:14.920> my<00:04:15.160> lower

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:15.400 
pole when I come into it why my lower

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:16.020 
pole when I come into it why my lower
body

00:04:16.020 --> 00:04:16.030 
body

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:17.969 
body
I<00:04:16.060> talked<00:04:16.690> already<00:04:16.930> about<00:04:17.140> the<00:04:17.350> hips<00:04:17.680> and

I talked already about the hips and

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:20.069 
I talked already about the hips and
really<00:04:18.220> being<00:04:18.489> able<00:04:18.669> to<00:04:18.880> open<00:04:19.600> your<00:04:19.630> hips<00:04:19.810> up

00:04:20.069 --> 00:04:20.079 
really being able to open your hips up

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:21.509 
really being able to open your hips up
to<00:04:20.229> generate<00:04:20.530> that<00:04:20.709> force

00:04:21.509 --> 00:04:21.519 
to generate that force

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:23.070 
to generate that force
you<00:04:21.639> want<00:04:21.819> to<00:04:21.880> also<00:04:22.030> use<00:04:22.210> a<00:04:22.330> lot<00:04:22.630> of<00:04:22.660> your<00:04:22.900> leg

strength so when you go into it you

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:27.210 
strength so when you go into it you
don't<00:04:25.389> want<00:04:25.780> to<00:04:25.840> be<00:04:25.900> standing<00:04:26.289> upright<00:04:26.590> you

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:27.220 
don't want to be standing upright you

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:28.950 
don't want to be standing upright you
want<00:04:27.400> to<00:04:27.490> be<00:04:27.580> down<00:04:27.819> crouched<00:04:28.210> kind<00:04:28.660> of<00:04:28.810> like

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 
want to be down crouched kind of like

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.890 
want to be down crouched kind of like
this<00:04:29.169> and<00:04:29.470> then<00:04:29.979> when<00:04:30.099> you<00:04:30.190> turn<00:04:30.460> and<00:04:30.729> rip<00:04:31.030> okay

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:31.900 
this and then when you turn and rip okay

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:34.080 
this and then when you turn and rip okay
your<00:04:32.380> hips<00:04:32.620> are<00:04:32.830> going<00:04:33.039> and<00:04:33.340> then<00:04:33.669> this<00:04:33.819> left

leg is exploding off that back and

00:04:38.380 --> 00:04:39.540 
leg is exploding off that back and
that's<00:04:38.680> going<00:04:38.830> to<00:04:38.889> generate<00:04:39.009> a<00:04:39.250> lot<00:04:39.370> of<00:04:39.430> force

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:39.550 
that's going to generate a lot of force

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:42.960 
that's going to generate a lot of force
lower<00:04:40.030> body<00:04:40.300> now<00:04:41.110> with<00:04:41.380> the<00:04:41.500> upper<00:04:41.860> body<00:04:41.970> you

00:04:59.100 --> 00:04:59.110 
rotation you're going to get the more

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:00.930 
rotation you're going to get the more
leverage<00:04:59.560> the<00:04:59.919> fire<00:05:00.160> the<00:05:00.370> pool<00:05:00.580> is<00:05:00.699> going<00:05:00.849> to

00:05:00.930 --> 00:05:00.940 
leverage the fire the pool is going to

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:02.900 
leverage the fire the pool is going to
get<00:05:01.120> and<00:05:01.330> then<00:05:01.990> as<00:05:02.169> I<00:05:02.199> come<00:05:02.620> through

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:02.910 
get and then as I come through

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:06.110 
get and then as I come through
everything<00:05:03.910> is<00:05:04.300> ripping<00:05:04.750> through<00:05:05.020> as<00:05:05.740> one

00:05:06.110 --> 00:05:06.120 
everything is ripping through as one

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:09.540 
everything is ripping through as one
unified<00:05:07.120> unit<00:05:07.539> here<00:05:07.810> and<00:05:08.320> at<00:05:08.440> the<00:05:08.590> end<00:05:08.800> I'm

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:09.550 
unified unit here and at the end I'm

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:12.360 
unified unit here and at the end I'm
really<00:05:10.000> snapping<00:05:10.750> my<00:05:11.080> wrist<00:05:11.410> and<00:05:11.680> then<00:05:12.250> I'm

really snapping my wrist and then I'm

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:14.850 
really snapping my wrist and then I'm
coming<00:05:12.820> off<00:05:12.970> my<00:05:13.150> left<00:05:13.360> side<00:05:13.599> okay<00:05:14.530> those<00:05:14.830> are

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:29.510 
can add in the hang time in the distance

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:32.020 
can add in the hang time in the distance
together<00:06:29.690> and<00:06:30.500> pull<00:06:30.860> it<00:06:30.980> in<00:06:31.100> bounds<00:06:31.670> you're
