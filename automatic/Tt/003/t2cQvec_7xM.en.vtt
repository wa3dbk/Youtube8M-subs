00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:15.929
 hey people are back today we do 

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:18.150
 yes Dutch cycling and that is 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.410
 a very simple a pot yes me 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.939
 did not want to show her pleasure 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.470
 you then just have a look at it 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.000
 can I have a kilo potatoes the 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.599
 we'll steal and then down 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.750
 give to the pot bottom because now 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:32.969
 come first pot and we will do that 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:36.950
 now have the first to learn here 

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:40.860
 potatoes and they just become 

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:44.840
 indiscriminately cut and got me 

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:47.969
 I already said it below 

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:50.300
 stratified there are also some regions 

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:52.770
 some recipes I know there are the 

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:57.920
 potatoes just peeled and 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:01:05.970
 halves but I prefer doing so 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:10.049
 and I think we better take two now 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:13.790
 peel the vegetables onions and would 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:13.790
 not too much 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:17.759
 and then change if the tenants 

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.659
 perhaps still belong with slices 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:20.250
 to be cut 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:22.560
 we do not have to leave the closet 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.049
 if I take the layers off and on 

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.360
 give then in layers stop also 

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:29.130
 the potatoes and water 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.229
 or me a little earlier 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.049
 because I think there has to be a bit 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:37.590
 taste a yes and then here 

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:49.890
 not to make default too freely 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:51.600
 I cut two three times 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.920
 here are still 800 grams of flour to the 

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.259
 world happen once or 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.570
 it really should not be missing 

00:01:54.259 --> 00:02:00.439
 could indeed to not only here 

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:03.570
 cut off and then just fine 

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:05.219
 under stone not too far because 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.720
 the belgian church is not exactly 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:11.770
 known for that the thing 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:16.810
 cut very fine so it is enough if 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:19.600
 you really that in 1 cm thick pieces 

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:20.410
 Of course , you should cut it 

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:40.090
 wash first 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:42.010
 we'll do all of that now 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:46.870
 know my videos already longer follow 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:50.670
 this brÃ¼hl glass and then we give 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:54.010
 now still hot water room or 

00:02:50.670 --> 00:02:55.690
 did you make her stop touching and I 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:59.709
 So do not give up not too much 

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:01.000
 above but sufficiently full and now 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:03.190
 you will just cook everything 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.540
 now we have something else went what 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:06.100
 I just wanted to say it to her 

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.870
 could it be the bacon? 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:10.180
 make a variant and specifically 

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.530
 let cyclists out there too 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.450
 but my variant is simple 

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:15.280
 Vegetarian and that was enough for that 

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:17.320
 that just went on the stove and 

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.370
 Cook everything soft and then 

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:21.670
 will not see each other again 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:25.840
 problem then we have here now once 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:31.180
 poured some beer and then we have 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:34.510
 here everything was nice and soft was fifth 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:36.810
 when their markets is a former 

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:40.989
 poor people eat 

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:46.120
 but I think it's just delicious 

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:49.180
 just a lot of meat eater of course 

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:51.670
 yet with bacon I already saw 

00:03:49.180 --> 00:03:55.060
 have not been tamped here yet 

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:59.110
 stood with gain and would do it once 

00:03:55.060 --> 00:04:00.310
 by mixing the once and the broth 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:01.750
 I have some which we need 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:04.690
 will become the everything dry 

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:06.500
 we are allowed to do that 

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:08.900
 and again a wet one 

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:12.620
 which assumptions can underestimate that 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:14.720
 some of you like that and that's so funny 

00:04:12.620 --> 00:04:18.440
 Its beautiful do not shine to top her 

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:21.230
 see it here and then you can 

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:23.720
 actually already eat so pretending 

00:04:21.230 --> 00:04:24.860
 maybe a bit green but so and so 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.200
 that was it apart again 

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:29.120
 location makes is really not difficult 

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:31.040
 you just saw everyone 

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:32.240
 layers cook what the vegetarian 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:35.270
 Variation is when you are not 

00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:37.160
 I said yes yes and if he speck 

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:39.770
 it was after made writes his 

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:41.990
 comments otherwise costs more quiet 

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:43.880
 a photo on facebook or under the 

00:04:41.990 --> 00:04:45.710
 hashtag yummy on google + twitter or 

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:49.070
 on facebook could also do here 

00:04:45.710 --> 00:04:50.660
 otherwise look for imamen instagram then 

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:52.280
 he drives a few things and 

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:54.680
 Of course delicious than the climate knowledge 

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:56.210
 starts in the food area is the buck 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:58.040
 you would like to follow yes and then 

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:00.820
 I'm out hopefully in the next 

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:00.820
 video again
