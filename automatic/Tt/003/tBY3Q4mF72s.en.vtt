fall behind year which is called a sonic

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:39.430 
fall behind year which is called a sonic
us<00:00:37.550> so<00:00:38.360> the<00:00:38.480> fold<00:00:38.780> and<00:00:38.960> medical<00:00:39.350> terminology

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:39.440 
us so the fold and medical terminology

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.160 
us so the fold and medical terminology
is<00:00:39.860> put<00:00:40.040> a<00:00:40.070> salt<00:00:40.370> crystal<00:00:40.790> out<00:00:40.910> to<00:00:41.120> me<00:00:41.300> fall

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:42.170 
is put a salt crystal out to me fall

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:43.960 
is put a salt crystal out to me fall
behind<00:00:42.350> the<00:00:42.680> air<00:00:42.800> and<00:00:43.250> then<00:00:43.399> back<00:00:43.640> in<00:00:43.850> the

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:43.970 
behind the air and then back in the

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:46.299 
behind the air and then back in the
hairline<00:00:44.380> so<00:00:45.380> they<00:00:45.530> did<00:00:45.710> this<00:00:45.829> gives<00:00:46.070> us<00:00:46.190> an

00:00:46.299 --> 00:00:46.309 
hairline so they did this gives us an

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:49.120 
hairline so they did this gives us an
extra<00:00:46.700> vector<00:00:47.390> to<00:00:47.660> really<00:00:48.050> pull<00:00:48.530> the<00:00:48.890> neck

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:49.130 
extra vector to really pull the neck

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:52.299 
extra vector to really pull the neck
back<00:00:49.660> in<00:00:50.660> that<00:00:50.870> way<00:00:51.290> so<00:00:51.350> they're<00:00:52.010> the<00:00:52.130> best

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:52.309 
back in that way so they're the best

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:54.010 
back in that way so they're the best
results<00:00:52.670> really<00:00:52.850> from<00:00:53.000> the<00:00:53.090> net<00:00:53.329> and<00:00:53.600> easel

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:54.020 
results really from the net and easel

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.380 
results really from the net and easel
but<00:00:54.530> you<00:00:54.680> know<00:00:54.800> pull<00:00:55.640> backwards<00:00:56.149> and<00:00:56.270> upwards

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.390 
but you know pull backwards and upwards

00:00:56.390 --> 00:00:59.049 
but you know pull backwards and upwards
from<00:00:57.050> the<00:00:57.200> face<00:00:57.410> it's<00:00:57.770> more<00:00:57.980> awkward<00:00:58.250> specific

00:00:59.049 --> 00:00:59.059 
from the face it's more awkward specific

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:00.910 
from the face it's more awkward specific
all<00:00:59.210> the<00:00:59.270> face<00:00:59.480> backwards<00:01:00.140> you<00:01:00.649> go<00:01:00.800> that

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:00.920 
all the face backwards you go that

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:03.160 
all the face backwards you go that
slightly<00:01:01.280> sort<00:01:01.610> of<00:01:01.730> unpleasant<00:01:02.480> sort<00:01:02.840> of<00:01:02.960> a

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:03.170 
slightly sort of unpleasant sort of a

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.149 
slightly sort of unpleasant sort of a
windswept<00:01:03.739> look<00:01:04.100> and<00:01:04.539> so<00:01:05.539> a<00:01:06.079> full<00:01:06.590> face<00:01:06.859> of<00:01:06.889> a

00:01:07.149 --> 00:01:07.159 
windswept look and so a full face of a

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:08.499 
windswept look and so a full face of a
lip<00:01:07.369> is<00:01:07.520> really<00:01:07.789> suitable<00:01:08.119> for<00:01:08.359> people

00:01:08.499 --> 00:01:08.509 
lip is really suitable for people

00:01:08.509 --> 00:01:11.529 
lip is really suitable for people
perhaps<00:01:08.840> over<00:01:09.200> the<00:01:09.289> age<00:01:09.409> of<00:01:09.590> 55<00:01:09.979> and<00:01:10.539> ending

00:01:11.529 --> 00:01:11.539 
perhaps over the age of 55 and ending

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:13.809 
perhaps over the age of 55 and ending
all<00:01:11.810> in<00:01:12.109> a<00:01:12.170> way<00:01:12.319> you<00:01:12.380> have<00:01:12.469> excess<00:01:12.950> skin<00:01:13.130> but<00:01:13.759> I

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:31.130 
facelift isn't really going to solve the

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.379

different types of facelift okay so what

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.210 
different types of facelift okay so what
it's<00:02:47.569> really<00:02:47.840> what<00:02:48.080> you<00:02:48.110> do<00:02:48.470> with<00:02:48.739> this<00:02:48.860> mask

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:49.220 
it's really what you do with this mask

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.390 
it's really what you do with this mask
is<00:02:49.549> the<00:02:50.030> is<00:02:50.870> the<00:02:50.930> main<00:02:51.260> differences<00:02:51.799> because

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:52.400 
is the is the main differences because

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.039 
is the is the main differences because
there's<00:02:52.549> a<00:02:52.640> sort<00:02:52.819> of<00:02:52.910> a<00:02:53.090> thought<00:02:53.510> by

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:54.049 
there's a sort of a thought by

00:02:54.049 --> 00:02:56.470 
there's a sort of a thought by
supporting<00:02:54.799> the<00:02:54.950> deep<00:02:55.190> layers<00:02:55.489> you're<00:02:56.329> going

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:56.480 
supporting the deep layers you're going

00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:57.569 
supporting the deep layers you're going
to<00:02:56.540> go<00:02:56.630> look<00:02:56.780> more<00:02:57.019> longer-lasting

00:02:57.569 --> 00:02:57.579 
to go look more longer-lasting

to go look more longer-lasting
rejuvenation<00:02:58.579> to<00:02:58.760> the<00:02:58.880> face<00:02:59.150> so<00:03:00.019> what's<00:03:00.200> the

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:00.290 
rejuvenation to the face so what's the

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:02.350 
rejuvenation to the face so what's the
simplest<00:03:00.620> thing<00:03:00.890> you<00:03:01.100> can<00:03:01.280> do<00:03:01.459> well<00:03:02.120> it's

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:02.360 
simplest thing you can do well it's

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:03.640 
simplest thing you can do well it's
interesting<00:03:02.510> to<00:03:02.870> do<00:03:02.989> is<00:03:03.110> probably<00:03:03.320> use

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:03.650 
interesting to do is probably use

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:05.860 
interesting to do is probably use
stitches<00:03:04.190> which<00:03:04.489> attended<00:03:04.970> from<00:03:05.180> a<00:03:05.269> secure

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:10.970 
area to lift up the smash okay and these

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:13.780 
area to lift up the smash okay and these
are<00:03:11.030> called<00:03:11.799> plication<00:03:12.799> stitches<00:03:13.370> because

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:13.790 
are called plication stitches because

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:17.110 
are called plication stitches because
you're<00:03:14.299> essentially<00:03:15.100> suit<00:03:16.100> suturing<00:03:16.670> the

00:04:12.610 --> 00:04:16.300 
those deep layers so you can perform
vacation<00:04:13.960> you<00:04:14.960> know<00:04:15.050> just<00:04:15.470> elevating<00:04:16.130> the

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:16.310 
vacation you know just elevating the

00:04:16.310 --> 00:04:19.390 
vacation you know just elevating the
stitches<00:04:16.730> or<00:04:17.270> remove<00:04:17.930> a<00:04:18.170> bit<00:04:18.350> and<00:04:18.920> so<00:04:19.220> off

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.400 
stitches or remove a bit and so off

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:22.270 
stitches or remove a bit and so off
fresh<00:04:19.820> and<00:04:20.120> edges<00:04:20.750> the<00:04:21.560> other<00:04:21.770> thing<00:04:22.010> we<00:04:22.130> can

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:22.280 
fresh and edges the other thing we can

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.910 
fresh and edges the other thing we can
do<00:04:22.460> is<00:04:22.670> go<00:04:22.880> underneath<00:04:23.480> the<00:04:23.960> smash<00:04:24.260> to

00:04:24.910 --> 00:04:24.920 
do is go underneath the smash to

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:27.010 
do is go underneath the smash to
actually<00:04:25.310> tunnel<00:04:25.730> underneath<00:04:26.240> that<00:04:26.720> layer

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:27.020 
actually tunnel underneath that layer

00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:30.310 
actually tunnel underneath that layer
and<00:04:27.410> then<00:04:27.890> elevate<00:04:28.460> it<00:04:28.730> as<00:04:28.970> a<00:04:29.030> different<00:04:29.630> layer

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:30.320 
and then elevate it as a different layer

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:34.090 
and then elevate it as a different layer
and<00:04:31.040> that's<00:04:31.250> what<00:04:31.460> a<00:04:31.490> smash<00:04:32.020> facelift<00:04:33.040> now<00:04:34.040> the

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:34.100 
and that's what a smash facelift now the

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:37.120 
and that's what a smash facelift now the
only<00:04:34.280> problem<00:04:34.340> with<00:04:34.730> that<00:04:34.760> is<00:04:35.300> that<00:04:36.130> the

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:37.130 
only problem with that is that the

00:04:37.130 --> 00:04:39.670 
only problem with that is that the
nerves<00:04:37.490> the<00:04:38.150> facial<00:04:38.690> nerve<00:04:38.720> which<00:04:39.290> supplies

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:39.680 
nerves the facial nerve which supplies

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.250 
nerves the facial nerve which supplies
the<00:04:39.940> movement<00:04:40.940> of<00:04:41.030> the<00:04:41.090> fate<00:04:41.450> lies<00:04:41.960> in<00:04:41.990> that

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:42.260 
the movement of the fate lies in that

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:45.550 
the movement of the fate lies in that
layer<00:04:42.710> so<00:04:43.490> you<00:04:44.030> know<00:04:44.180> the<00:04:44.420> risk<00:04:44.750> damaging<00:04:45.500> the

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:45.560 
layer so you know the risk damaging the

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.460 
layer so you know the risk damaging the
nerves<00:04:45.860> is<00:04:46.190> slightly<00:04:46.730> higher<00:04:46.880> and<00:04:47.690> when<00:04:48.169> and

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:48.470 
nerves is slightly higher and when and

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:51.130 
nerves is slightly higher and when and
people<00:04:48.919> get<00:04:49.070> underneath<00:04:49.430> the<00:04:49.760> smash<00:04:50.060> you<00:04:51.020> know

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:51.140 
people get underneath the smash you know

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:52.810 
people get underneath the smash you know
that's<00:04:51.440> where<00:04:51.650> the<00:04:51.770> bones<00:04:52.010> are<00:04:52.280> and<00:04:52.640> you

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:52.820 
that's where the bones are and you

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:54.679 
that's where the bones are and you
obviously<00:04:53.450> want<00:04:53.840> to<00:04:53.900> avoid<00:04:54.140> those

00:04:54.679 --> 00:04:54.689 
obviously want to avoid those

00:04:54.689 --> 00:04:58.449 
obviously want to avoid those
as<00:04:54.929> possible<00:04:55.789> so<00:04:56.789> I<00:04:57.119> hope<00:04:57.539> that<00:04:57.599> some

00:04:58.449 --> 00:04:58.459 
as possible so I hope that some

00:04:58.459 --> 00:05:01.699 
as possible so I hope that some
clarified<00:04:59.459> some<00:04:59.669> of<00:04:59.819> the<00:04:59.939> issues<00:05:00.469> just<00:05:01.469> to<00:05:01.559> run

00:05:01.699 --> 00:05:01.709 
clarified some of the issues just to run

00:05:01.709 --> 00:05:04.069 
clarified some of the issues just to run
over<00:05:01.860> it<00:05:02.069> again<00:05:02.189> short<00:05:02.849> Scarface<00:05:03.419> left<00:05:03.749> here

00:05:04.069 --> 00:05:04.079 
over it again short Scarface left here

00:05:04.079 --> 00:05:06.949 
over it again short Scarface left here
here<00:05:04.829> little<00:05:05.579> bit<00:05:05.699> behind<00:05:05.849> full<00:05:06.689> facelift

00:05:06.949 --> 00:05:06.959 
here little bit behind full facelift

00:05:06.959 --> 00:05:09.439 
here little bit behind full facelift
involves<00:05:07.919> an<00:05:08.039> incision<00:05:08.579> behind<00:05:08.759> into<00:05:09.360> the

00:05:09.439 --> 00:05:09.449 
involves an incision behind into the

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:11.239 
involves an incision behind into the
back<00:05:09.659> and<00:05:09.899> then<00:05:10.439> there's<00:05:10.619> various<00:05:10.799> options

00:05:11.239 --> 00:05:11.249 
back and then there's various options

00:05:11.249 --> 00:05:13.909 
back and then there's various options
for<00:05:11.549> what<00:05:11.849> we<00:05:11.969> do<00:05:12.119> with<00:05:12.269> the<00:05:12.389> smash<00:05:12.779> tissue<00:05:13.559> has

00:05:13.909 --> 00:05:13.919 
for what we do with the smash tissue has

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:17.299 
for what we do with the smash tissue has
the<00:05:14.099> SMAS<00:05:14.909> we<00:05:15.629> did<00:05:15.809> the<00:05:15.929> simplest<00:05:16.409> involves

00:05:17.299 --> 00:05:17.309 
the SMAS we did the simplest involves

00:05:17.309 --> 00:05:19.449 
the SMAS we did the simplest involves
stitching<00:05:17.819> it<00:05:17.939> up<00:05:18.119> through<00:05:18.449> its<00:05:18.569> own<00:05:18.659> position

00:05:19.449 --> 00:05:19.459 
stitching it up through its own position

00:05:19.459 --> 00:05:22.519 
stitching it up through its own position
then<00:05:20.459> moving<00:05:20.699> on<00:05:20.939> to<00:05:20.969> the<00:05:21.089> smash<00:05:21.599> ex<00:05:22.139> me

00:05:22.519 --> 00:05:22.529 
then moving on to the smash ex me

00:05:22.529 --> 00:05:24.919 
then moving on to the smash ex me
removing<00:05:23.459> the<00:05:23.489> strip<00:05:23.789> of<00:05:23.939> it<00:05:24.089> and<00:05:24.419> selling<00:05:24.719> it

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:24.929 
removing the strip of it and selling it

00:05:24.929 --> 00:05:28.249 
removing the strip of it and selling it
up<00:05:25.399> moving<00:05:26.399> and<00:05:26.519> band<00:05:26.699> and<00:05:27.059> saying<00:05:27.300> it<00:05:27.479> up<00:05:27.689> and

00:05:28.249 --> 00:05:28.259 
up moving and band and saying it up and

00:05:28.259 --> 00:05:30.589 
up moving and band and saying it up and
then<00:05:28.409> moving<00:05:28.800> on<00:05:28.949> to<00:05:28.979> the<00:05:29.219> flat<00:05:30.059> tank<00:05:30.389> needs

00:05:30.589 --> 00:05:30.599 
then moving on to the flat tank needs

00:05:30.599 --> 00:05:33.019 
then moving on to the flat tank needs
which<00:05:30.869> go<00:05:31.110> underneath<00:05:31.679> a<00:05:32.009> smash<00:05:32.279> and<00:05:32.610> lift<00:05:32.879> it

00:05:33.019 --> 00:05:33.029 
which go underneath a smash and lift it

00:05:33.029 --> 00:05:34.939 
which go underneath a smash and lift it
is<00:05:33.149> a<00:05:33.179> layer<00:05:33.509> than<00:05:34.019> the<00:05:34.169> layer<00:05:34.379> is<00:05:34.739> then

00:05:34.939 --> 00:05:34.949 
is a layer than the layer is then

00:05:34.949 --> 00:05:38.809 
is a layer than the layer is then
stitched<00:05:35.639> to<00:05:35.819> its<00:05:35.939> new<00:05:36.089> position<00:05:36.679> so<00:05:37.679> in<00:05:38.429> my

00:05:38.809 --> 00:05:38.819 
stitched to its new position so in my

00:05:38.819 --> 00:05:42.439 
stitched to its new position so in my
opinion<00:05:39.409> all<00:05:40.409> of<00:05:40.589> these<00:05:40.769> and<00:05:41.099> techniques<00:05:41.909> very

00:05:42.439 --> 00:05:42.449 
opinion all of these and techniques very

00:05:42.449 --> 00:05:45.139 
opinion all of these and techniques very
very<00:05:42.779> effective<00:05:43.379> and<00:05:43.559> and<00:05:44.399> one<00:05:44.759> is<00:05:44.909> not

00:05:45.139 --> 00:05:45.149 
very effective and and one is not

00:05:45.149 --> 00:05:47.209 
very effective and and one is not
necessarily<00:05:45.809> better<00:05:46.079> than<00:05:46.469> the<00:05:46.529> other<00:05:46.709> all

00:05:47.209 --> 00:05:47.219 
necessarily better than the other all

00:05:47.219 --> 00:05:48.889 
necessarily better than the other all
you<00:05:47.459> need<00:05:47.639> to<00:05:47.669> do<00:05:47.909> is<00:05:48.179> discuss<00:05:48.629> with<00:05:48.809> your
