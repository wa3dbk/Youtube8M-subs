with this hot chocolate lipstick I think

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:16.849 
with this hot chocolate lipstick I think
I<00:00:15.509> was<00:00:15.660> inspired<00:00:15.870> to<00:00:16.139> do<00:00:16.320> this<00:00:16.350> look<00:00:16.710> because

00:00:16.849 --> 00:00:16.859 
I was inspired to do this look because

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.320 
I was inspired to do this look because
it's<00:00:17.160> a<00:00:17.250> little<00:00:17.490> bit<00:00:17.609> colder<00:00:18.029> here<00:00:18.210> in

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
it's a little bit colder here in

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.000 
it's a little bit colder here in
Australia<00:00:18.869> at<00:00:19.050> the<00:00:19.080> moment<00:00:19.230> and<00:00:19.650> I've<00:00:19.770> been

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:20.010 
Australia at the moment and I've been

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.189 
Australia at the moment and I've been
drinking<00:00:20.430> a<00:00:20.550> lot<00:00:20.910> of<00:00:21.090> hot<00:00:21.240> chocolate<00:00:21.480> so<00:00:22.170> I

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
drinking a lot of hot chocolate so I

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.109 
drinking a lot of hot chocolate so I
thought<00:00:22.619> it<00:00:22.740> might<00:00:22.769> grow<00:00:23.100> well<00:00:23.279> in<00:00:23.310> my<00:00:23.730> sweet
