their<00:00:15.570> cameras<00:00:16.049> a<00:00:16.230> lot<00:00:16.680> of<00:00:16.740> people<00:00:17.039> seem<00:00:17.220> to<00:00:17.250> be

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:17.400 
their cameras a lot of people seem to be

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.910 
their cameras a lot of people seem to be
thinking<00:00:17.430> that<00:00:17.940> 4k<00:00:18.539> will<00:00:18.750> bring<00:00:18.960> nikon<00:00:19.410> fully

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:19.920 
thinking that 4k will bring nikon fully

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.210 
thinking that 4k will bring nikon fully
into<00:00:20.310> the<00:00:20.400> video<00:00:20.670> game<00:00:20.730> make<00:00:21.420> them<00:00:21.600> a

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:22.220 
into the video game make them a

into the video game make them a
significant<00:00:23.220> player<00:00:23.519> and<00:00:23.840> Tom's<00:00:24.840> got<00:00:25.080> some

significant player and Tom's got some

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:29.000 
significant player and Tom's got some
really<00:00:25.650> good<00:00:25.859> points<00:00:26.550> why<00:00:27.269> not<00:00:28.230> why<00:00:28.949> this

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
really good points why not why this

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.070 
really good points why not why this
shouldn't<00:00:29.670> happen<00:00:29.939> and<00:00:30.240> why<00:00:30.539> it<00:00:30.599> won't

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080 
shouldn't happen and why it won't

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.470 
shouldn't happen and why it won't
necessarily<00:00:31.489> do<00:00:32.489> what<00:00:32.700> people<00:00:32.969> think<00:00:33.300> it's

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:33.480 
necessarily do what people think it's

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:37.819 
necessarily do what people think it's
gonna<00:00:33.660> do<00:00:34.100> first<00:00:35.100> and<00:00:35.340> foremost<00:00:36.500> Tom<00:00:37.500> says

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
gonna do first and foremost Tom says

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.850 
gonna do first and foremost Tom says
that<00:00:38.239> broadcasting<00:00:39.239> is<00:00:39.480> still<00:00:40.170> standardized

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
that broadcasting is still standardized

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:44.180 
that broadcasting is still standardized
on<00:00:41.160> HD<00:00:41.760> video<00:00:42.440> basically<00:00:43.440> is<00:00:43.680> saying<00:00:43.950> is

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
on HD video basically is saying is

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.130 
on HD video basically is saying is
that's<00:00:44.399> all<00:00:44.700> the<00:00:44.940> variations<00:00:45.450> up<00:00:45.600> to<00:00:45.719> 1080p

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140 
that's all the variations up to 1080p

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:48.229 
that's all the variations up to 1080p
but<00:00:46.680> that's<00:00:46.860> what<00:00:46.980> broadcasting<00:00:47.820> is<00:00:47.940> still

00:00:48.229 --> 00:00:48.239 
but that's what broadcasting is still

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:50.090 
but that's what broadcasting is still
standardized<00:00:48.989> on<00:00:49.230> he<00:00:49.500> breaks<00:00:49.739> it<00:00:49.890> down

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
standardized on he breaks it down

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.189 
standardized on he breaks it down
further<00:00:50.640> saying<00:00:51.390> that<00:00:51.510> if<00:00:51.600> you<00:00:51.690> want<00:00:51.840> really

00:00:52.189 --> 00:00:52.199 
further saying that if you want really

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:54.260 
further saying that if you want really
good<00:00:52.320> broadcast<00:00:53.070> quality<00:00:53.280> that<00:00:53.910> you<00:00:54.030> need<00:00:54.059> at

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
good broadcast quality that you need at

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.720 
good broadcast quality that you need at
least<00:00:54.329> 50<00:00:55.020> megabytes<00:00:55.469> per<00:00:55.559> second<00:00:56.129> you<00:00:56.520> need

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
least 50 megabytes per second you need

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.959 
least 50 megabytes per second you need
four<00:00:57.149> to<00:00:57.329> two<00:00:57.510> color<00:00:58.520> preferably<00:00:59.520> four<00:00:59.730> for

00:00:59.959 --> 00:00:59.969 
four to two color preferably four for

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.700 
four to two color preferably four for
four<00:01:00.210> and<00:01:00.500> also<00:01:01.500> preferably<00:01:02.489> 10<00:01:03.030> bit

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:03.710 
four and also preferably 10 bit

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.800 
four and also preferably 10 bit
recordings<00:01:04.710> and<00:01:04.890> so<00:01:05.610> basically<00:01:06.180> he's<00:01:06.780> saying

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:06.810 
recordings and so basically he's saying

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.230 
recordings and so basically he's saying
that<00:01:07.320> there's<00:01:07.560> no<00:01:07.799> need<00:01:08.040> for<00:01:08.070> 4k<00:01:08.670> because<00:01:08.880> in

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
that there's no need for 4k because in

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:12.500 
that there's no need for 4k because in
general<00:01:10.310> broadcasting<00:01:11.310> is<00:01:11.430> still<00:01:11.670> in<00:01:11.939> at<00:01:12.150> the

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
general broadcasting is still in at the

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.160 
general broadcasting is still in at the
most<00:01:12.689> 1080<00:01:13.530> HD<00:01:13.939> furthermore<00:01:14.939> he's<00:01:15.689> pointing

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
most 1080 HD furthermore he's pointing

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.859 
most 1080 HD furthermore he's pointing
out<00:01:16.320> and<00:01:16.560> to<00:01:16.920> quote<00:01:17.189> him<00:01:17.430> still<00:01:18.240> cameras<00:01:18.689> that

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
out and to quote him still cameras that

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.810 
out and to quote him still cameras that
do<00:01:19.020> video<00:01:19.200> are<00:01:19.619> typically<00:01:20.310> 20<00:01:21.060> to<00:01:21.180> 28<00:01:21.540> Mbps<00:01:22.320> and

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820 
do video are typically 20 to 28 Mbps and

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.420 
do video are typically 20 to 28 Mbps and
4<00:01:23.820> to<00:01:24.090> 0<00:01:24.540> color<00:01:24.869> and<00:01:25.140> 8<00:01:25.409> bits<00:01:25.650> so<00:01:26.220> what<00:01:26.340> he's

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:26.430 
4 to 0 color and 8 bits so what he's

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.999 
4 to 0 color and 8 bits so what he's
getting<00:01:26.610> at<00:01:26.880> here<00:01:27.180> is<00:01:27.360> that<00:01:27.659> the<00:01:28.560> cameras<00:01:28.920> we

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
getting at here is that the cameras we

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:30.920 
getting at here is that the cameras we
have<00:01:29.040> right<00:01:29.369> now<00:01:29.400> still<00:01:30.150> aren't<00:01:30.479> up<00:01:30.630> to<00:01:30.689> the

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:30.930 
have right now still aren't up to the

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:34.580 
have right now still aren't up to the
task<00:01:31.280> to<00:01:32.280> do<00:01:32.490> video<00:01:33.479> the<00:01:33.720> way<00:01:33.869> it<00:01:34.140> should<00:01:34.170> be

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590 
task to do video the way it should be

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:37.670 
task to do video the way it should be
done<00:01:34.740> for<00:01:35.430> broadcast<00:01:36.329> quality<00:01:36.509> video<00:01:37.079> now

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
done for broadcast quality video now

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.160 
done for broadcast quality video now
some<00:01:38.009> of<00:01:38.040> them<00:01:38.189> like<00:01:38.490> say<00:01:38.759> the<00:01:38.909> gh3<00:01:39.240> they

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
some of them like say the gh3 they

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.230 
some of them like say the gh3 they
probably<00:01:40.439> get<00:01:40.770> closer<00:01:41.159> than<00:01:41.549> others<00:01:41.820> because

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
probably get closer than others because

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.870 
probably get closer than others because
I<00:01:42.420> mean<00:01:42.689> you<00:01:43.140> can<00:01:43.320> get<00:01:43.439> past<00:01:43.920> 50<00:01:44.369> megabytes<00:01:44.820> per

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
I mean you can get past 50 megabytes per

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:47.030 
I mean you can get past 50 megabytes per
second<00:01:45.479> and<00:01:45.659> you<00:01:46.200> could<00:01:46.350> do<00:01:46.439> some<00:01:46.590> hacks<00:01:46.799> and

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040 
second and you could do some hacks and

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.530 
second and you could do some hacks and
things<00:01:47.220> to<00:01:47.430> improve<00:01:47.759> your<00:01:47.909> color<00:01:48.149> and<00:01:48.329> things

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540 
things to improve your color and things

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.960 
things to improve your color and things
like<00:01:48.659> that<00:01:48.720> but<00:01:49.380> basically<00:01:49.619> we<00:01:50.579> don't<00:01:50.729> have

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 
like that but basically we don't have

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:53.690 
like that but basically we don't have
cameras<00:01:51.509> that<00:01:51.659> are<00:01:51.720> producing<00:01:52.439> the<00:01:53.130> quality

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
cameras that are producing the quality

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.090 
cameras that are producing the quality
we<00:01:53.850> could<00:01:54.030> use<00:01:54.270> where<00:01:54.810> our<00:01:55.049> current<00:01:55.439> standard

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:56.100 
we could use where our current standard

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:58.999 
we could use where our current standard
of<00:01:56.250> 1080<00:01:56.640> HD<00:01:57.170> built<00:01:58.170> right<00:01:58.320> into<00:01:58.530> the<00:01:58.680> camera

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
of 1080 HD built right into the camera

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:02.469 
of 1080 HD built right into the camera
has<00:01:59.280> to<00:01:59.399> be<00:01:59.490> done<00:01:59.700> in<00:02:00.079> externally<00:02:01.079> in<00:02:01.770> post

00:02:02.469 --> 00:02:02.479 
has to be done in externally in post

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:06.800 
has to be done in externally in post
which<00:02:03.479> brings<00:02:03.810> us<00:02:04.020> to<00:02:04.469> number<00:02:04.619> 2<00:02:05.070> he<00:02:05.820> says<00:02:06.119> what

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:06.810 
which brings us to number 2 he says what

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.869 
which brings us to number 2 he says what
we<00:02:06.960> really<00:02:07.439> want<00:02:07.649> is<00:02:07.860> something<00:02:08.099> like<00:02:08.399> Apple

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:08.879 
we really want is something like Apple

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:12.350 
we really want is something like Apple
ProRes<00:02:09.179> compression<00:02:10.140> instead<00:02:10.709> of<00:02:10.890> AVC<00:02:11.700> HD<00:02:11.849> and

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:12.360 
ProRes compression instead of AVC HD and

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:14.059 
ProRes compression instead of AVC HD and
at<00:02:13.020> higher<00:02:13.349> bandwidth

00:02:14.059 --> 00:02:14.069 
at higher bandwidth

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:17.809 
at higher bandwidth
with<00:02:14.640> as<00:02:14.819> many<00:02:15.030> bits<00:02:15.540> as<00:02:15.950> possible<00:02:16.950> catch

00:02:17.809 --> 00:02:17.819 
with as many bits as possible catch

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:19.750 
with as many bits as possible catch
myself<00:02:18.090> on<00:02:18.420> all<00:02:18.569> those<00:02:18.719> bits<00:02:18.989> and<00:02:19.200> widths

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
myself on all those bits and widths

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.129 
myself on all those bits and widths
anyways<00:02:20.760> basically<00:02:21.030> what<00:02:21.450> he's<00:02:21.569> saying<00:02:21.840> here

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:22.139 
anyways basically what he's saying here

00:02:22.139 --> 00:02:24.379 
anyways basically what he's saying here
again<00:02:22.709> is<00:02:23.010> that<00:02:23.219> we<00:02:23.340> need<00:02:23.459> better<00:02:23.700> abilities

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:24.389 
again is that we need better abilities

00:02:24.389 --> 00:02:27.349 
again is that we need better abilities
in<00:02:24.659> camera<00:02:25.260> for<00:02:25.980> the<00:02:26.340> current<00:02:26.790> standard<00:02:27.209> we

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:27.359 
in camera for the current standard we

00:02:27.359 --> 00:02:29.720 
in camera for the current standard we
have<00:02:27.389> and<00:02:27.810> that's<00:02:27.870> the<00:02:28.049> 1080<00:02:28.469> HD<00:02:28.609> before<00:02:29.609> we

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
have and that's the 1080 HD before we

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.000 
have and that's the 1080 HD before we
really<00:02:29.999> should<00:02:30.209> be<00:02:30.239> looking<00:02:30.329> at<00:02:30.810> going<00:02:31.139> to<00:02:31.439> 4k

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
really should be looking at going to 4k

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.280 
really should be looking at going to 4k
and<00:02:32.760> I<00:02:33.090> think<00:02:33.540> he's<00:02:33.689> right<00:02:33.900> there

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
and I think he's right there

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:36.440 
and I think he's right there
you<00:02:34.560> can<00:02:34.709> get<00:02:34.859> all<00:02:34.950> these<00:02:35.099> in<00:02:35.280> post<00:02:35.579> as<00:02:35.879> Tom

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:36.450 
you can get all these in post as Tom

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.569 
you can get all these in post as Tom
points<00:02:36.840> out<00:02:37.019> but<00:02:37.769> there's<00:02:37.950> really<00:02:38.129> nothing

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:38.579 
points out but there's really nothing

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:39.949 
points out but there's really nothing
out<00:02:38.700> there<00:02:38.760> that<00:02:39.090> allows<00:02:39.329> you<00:02:39.510> to<00:02:39.599> get<00:02:39.780> this

00:02:39.949 --> 00:02:39.959 
out there that allows you to get this

00:02:39.959 --> 00:02:42.259 
out there that allows you to get this
straight<00:02:40.409> out<00:02:40.650> of<00:02:40.859> camera<00:02:41.189> Tom<00:02:41.849> puts<00:02:42.120> it

00:02:42.259 --> 00:02:42.269 
straight out of camera Tom puts it

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:44.239 
straight out of camera Tom puts it
nicely<00:02:42.510> when<00:02:42.870> he<00:02:42.930> asked<00:02:43.230> the<00:02:43.319> question<00:02:43.859> which

00:02:44.239 --> 00:02:44.249 
nicely when he asked the question which

00:02:44.249 --> 00:02:47.750 
nicely when he asked the question which
would<00:02:44.459> be<00:02:44.519> rather<00:02:44.849> have<00:02:45.180> 1080p<00:02:46.169> 1920<00:02:47.010> by<00:02:47.400> 1080

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:47.760 
would be rather have 1080p 1920 by 1080

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.849 
would be rather have 1080p 1920 by 1080
done<00:02:48.030> right<00:02:48.329> or<00:02:48.659> 4k<00:02:50.030> 3840<00:02:51.030> by<00:02:51.060> 2160<00:02:51.599> done<00:02:52.530> wrong

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:52.859 
done right or 4k 3840 by 2160 done wrong

00:02:52.859 --> 00:02:55.429 
done right or 4k 3840 by 2160 done wrong
he<00:02:53.340> answers<00:02:53.730> it<00:02:53.939> too<00:02:54.150> when<00:02:54.599> he<00:02:54.719> says<00:02:54.989> the

00:02:55.429 --> 00:02:55.439 
he answers it too when he says the

00:02:55.439 --> 00:02:57.349 
he answers it too when he says the
answer<00:02:55.590> is<00:02:55.799> simple<00:02:55.919> to<00:02:56.430> anyone<00:02:56.819> doing<00:02:57.030> video

00:02:57.349 --> 00:02:57.359 
answer is simple to anyone doing video

00:02:57.359 --> 00:03:01.640 
answer is simple to anyone doing video
with<00:02:57.569> DSLRs<00:02:58.430> 1080p<00:02:59.430> done<00:02:59.699> right<00:03:00.469> frankly<00:03:01.469> I

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:01.650 
with DSLRs 1080p done right frankly I

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.530 
with DSLRs 1080p done right frankly I
think<00:03:01.739> he's<00:03:02.159> got<00:03:02.340> an<00:03:02.430> excellent<00:03:03.000> point<00:03:03.239> here

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:03.540 
think he's got an excellent point here

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.119 
think he's got an excellent point here
and<00:03:03.750> I<00:03:03.840> would<00:03:04.019> tend<00:03:04.230> to<00:03:04.290> agree<00:03:04.590> with<00:03:04.680> them<00:03:04.949> and

00:03:05.119 --> 00:03:05.129 
and I would tend to agree with them and

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:07.640 
and I would tend to agree with them and
that<00:03:05.909> brings<00:03:06.209> us<00:03:06.389> to<00:03:06.569> point<00:03:07.049> number<00:03:07.230> three

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650 
that brings us to point number three

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:13.009 
that brings us to point number three
who's<00:03:08.010> driving<00:03:08.849> the<00:03:09.599> demand<00:03:10.069> for<00:03:11.069> 4k<00:03:11.340> I<00:03:12.019> don't

00:03:13.009 --> 00:03:13.019 
who's driving the demand for 4k I don't

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:15.439 
who's driving the demand for 4k I don't
really<00:03:13.290> think<00:03:13.439> it's<00:03:13.769> the<00:03:13.919> consumers<00:03:14.579> although

00:03:15.439 --> 00:03:15.449 
really think it's the consumers although

00:03:15.449 --> 00:03:17.809 
really think it's the consumers although
when<00:03:16.019> the<00:03:16.049> consumers<00:03:16.709> do<00:03:16.949> get<00:03:17.189> riled<00:03:17.400> up<00:03:17.609> and

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:17.819 
when the consumers do get riled up and

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:20.390 
when the consumers do get riled up and
say<00:03:18.090> they<00:03:18.239> want<00:03:18.479> it<00:03:18.709> there's<00:03:19.709> somebody<00:03:20.129> that's

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:20.400 
say they want it there's somebody that's

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.309 
say they want it there's somebody that's
causing<00:03:20.790> that<00:03:21.150> to<00:03:21.329> happen<00:03:21.509> and<00:03:21.870> as<00:03:21.989> Tom's

00:03:22.309 --> 00:03:22.319 
causing that to happen and as Tom's

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:24.619 
causing that to happen and as Tom's
pointing<00:03:22.769> out<00:03:22.889> it's<00:03:23.340> the<00:03:23.519> TV<00:03:23.879> manufacturers

00:03:24.619 --> 00:03:24.629 
pointing out it's the TV manufacturers

00:03:24.629 --> 00:03:27.740 
pointing out it's the TV manufacturers
