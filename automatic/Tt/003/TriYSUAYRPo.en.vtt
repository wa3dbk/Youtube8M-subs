the background image so you have a

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:11.690 
the background image so you have a
background<00:00:10.860> image<00:00:10.950> here<00:00:11.250> and<00:00:11.370> this<00:00:11.429> is<00:00:11.490> the

background image here and this is the

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.190 
background image here and this is the
website<00:00:11.880> actually<00:00:12.269> at<00:00:12.509> the<00:00:12.570> bottom<00:00:12.870> what<00:00:13.110> is

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
now so let's jump with code through here

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:41.180 
now so let's jump with code through here
for<00:00:40.050> a<00:00:40.230> second<00:00:40.500> and<00:00:40.590> show<00:00:40.739> you<00:00:40.800> guys<00:00:40.980> what<00:00:41.160> I

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
for a second and show you guys what I

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.500 
for a second and show you guys what I
mean<00:00:41.399> it's<00:00:41.579> gonna<00:00:41.670> alter<00:00:41.969> expand<00:00:42.480> the

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:42.510 
mean it's gonna alter expand the

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:43.850 
mean it's gonna alter expand the
background<00:00:42.989> is<00:00:43.050> going<00:00:43.200> to<00:00:43.260> add<00:00:43.350> exponent

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 
background is going to add exponent

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.229 
background is going to add exponent
contract<00:00:44.309> and<00:00:44.489> I<00:00:44.520> should<00:00:44.700> probably<00:00:44.850> show<00:00:45.180> you

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
contract and I should probably show you

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.779 
contract and I should probably show you
guys<00:00:45.480> a<00:00:45.840> sample<00:00:46.800> here<00:00:46.950> well<00:00:47.160> this<00:00:47.340> might<00:00:47.610> go

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
guys a sample here well this might go

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.279 
guys a sample here well this might go
off<00:00:47.910> screen<00:00:48.329> here<00:00:48.600> for<00:00:48.780> a<00:00:48.809> second<00:00:49.200> guys

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
off screen here for a second guys

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.130 
off screen here for a second guys
because<00:00:50.239> I'm<00:00:51.239> really<00:00:51.449> much<00:00:51.629> to<00:00:51.660> screen

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
because I'm really much to screen

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.779 
because I'm really much to screen
yourself<00:00:52.500> I<00:00:52.739> get<00:00:52.890> back<00:00:53.010> on<00:00:53.190> the<00:00:53.309> screen<00:00:53.520> if<00:00:53.670> it

00:00:53.779 --> 00:00:53.789 
yourself I get back on the screen if it

00:00:53.789 --> 00:01:00.139 
yourself I get back on the screen if it
does<00:00:55.820> actually<00:00:56.820> it<00:00:57.449> doesn't<00:00:58.640> so<00:00:59.640> there<00:01:00.000> we<00:01:00.120> go

00:01:00.139 --> 00:01:00.149 
does actually it doesn't so there we go

00:01:00.149 --> 00:01:02.270 
does actually it doesn't so there we go
so<00:01:00.780> if<00:01:00.899> we<00:01:00.960> should<00:01:01.230> scale<00:01:01.649> this<00:01:01.859> in<00:01:02.070> and<00:01:02.160> watch

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
so if we should scale this in and watch

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.329 
so if we should scale this in and watch
the<00:01:02.489> image<00:01:03.619> see<00:01:04.619> what's<00:01:05.070> the<00:01:05.159> background

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
the image see what's the background

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.820 
the image see what's the background
image<00:01:05.640> it<00:01:06.000> stays<00:01:06.570> exactly<00:01:06.810> right<00:01:07.260> supposed<00:01:07.619> to

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:07.830 
image it stays exactly right supposed to

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.620 
image it stays exactly right supposed to
it<00:01:07.979> doesn't<00:01:08.340> move<00:01:08.460> it<00:01:08.640> all<00:01:08.760> to<00:01:09.000> expand<00:01:09.420> and

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:09.630 
it doesn't move it all to expand and

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.149 
it doesn't move it all to expand and
contract<00:01:09.750> based<00:01:10.320> on<00:01:10.439> browser<00:01:10.650> sighs<00:01:10.920> I'm<00:01:11.070> a

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509 
you can see as you can see it stays

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.929 
you can see as you can see it stays
where<00:01:16.290> it's<00:01:16.439> supposed<00:01:16.530> to<00:01:16.890> watch<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:17.700> hand

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:21.620 
where it's supposed to watch the hand
right<00:01:18.180> here<00:01:18.420> it<00:01:18.600> won't<00:01:18.900> go<00:01:19.080> past<00:01:19.909> here<00:01:20.909> no

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
right here it won't go past here no

matter how much you are the exponent

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:24.830 
matter how much you are the exponent

00:01:34.039 --> 00:01:34.049 
about here so in the code it's really

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:35.569 
about here so in the code it's really
really<00:01:34.200> simple<00:01:34.259> to<00:01:34.590> setup<00:01:34.890> let's<00:01:35.220> jump<00:01:35.369> in<00:01:35.490> my

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:40.630 
i'll share how to make your background

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:43.800 
i'll share how to make your background
all<00:03:40.780> to<00:03:40.959> expand<00:03:41.579> base<00:03:42.579> on<00:03:42.850> screen<00:03:43.299> size<00:03:43.540> so

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810 
all to expand base on screen size so

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:45.930 
all to expand base on screen size so
again<00:03:44.109> i'll<00:03:44.290> give<00:03:44.500> you<00:03:44.650> a<00:03:44.859> little<00:03:45.250> preview<00:03:45.459> so

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:45.940 
again i'll give you a little preview so

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.210 
again i'll give you a little preview so
this<00:03:46.450> is<00:03:46.570> what<00:03:46.720> it<00:03:46.840> is<00:03:46.870> and<00:03:47.290> in<00:03:47.950> the<00:03:48.069> background

00:03:48.210 --> 00:03:48.220 
this is what it is and in the background

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.069 
this is what it is and in the background
here<00:03:48.730> you<00:03:48.790> can<00:03:48.940> see<00:03:49.090> just<00:03:49.120> watch<00:03:49.450> the<00:03:49.600> hand<00:03:49.840> or

00:03:50.069 --> 00:03:50.079 
here you can see just watch the hand or

00:03:50.079 --> 00:03:51.900 
here you can see just watch the hand or
the<00:03:50.140> head<00:03:50.769> they<00:03:51.130> had<00:03:51.310> to<00:03:51.400> automatically

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:51.910 
the head they had to automatically

00:03:51.910 --> 00:03:54.090 
the head they had to automatically
shrink<00:03:52.420> because<00:03:52.870> it's<00:03:53.440> going<00:03:53.590> to<00:03:53.650> shrink<00:03:53.890> the

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:54.100 
shrink because it's going to shrink the

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:57.599 
shrink because it's going to shrink the
image<00:03:54.130> in<00:03:54.630> the<00:03:55.630> exposition<00:03:56.500> see<00:03:56.980> it's

00:03:57.599 --> 00:03:57.609 
image in the exposition see it's

00:03:57.609 --> 00:04:00.660 
image in the exposition see it's
shrinking<00:03:57.940> the<00:03:58.180> image<00:03:58.450> in<00:03:58.660> the<00:03:59.140> exposition<00:03:59.890> so

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:00.670 
shrinking the image in the exposition so

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:02.550 
shrinking the image in the exposition so
it<00:04:00.760> still<00:04:01.000> show<00:04:01.180> the<00:04:01.299> entire<00:04:01.630> image<00:04:01.959> it<00:04:02.319> just

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:02.560 
it still show the entire image it just

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:05.220 
it still show the entire image it just
made<00:04:02.769> it<00:04:02.799> smaller<00:04:03.609> that's<00:04:04.600> all<00:04:04.840> it's<00:04:05.049> doing

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:05.230 
made it smaller that's all it's doing

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:07.680 
made it smaller that's all it's doing
you<00:04:05.889> can<00:04:06.010> see<00:04:06.190> it's<00:04:06.310> expanding<00:04:06.819> again<00:04:07.090> to<00:04:07.569> make

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:07.690 
you can see it's expanding again to make

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:09.809 
you can see it's expanding again to make
it<00:04:07.870> larger<00:04:08.380> so<00:04:08.590> if<00:04:09.130> you<00:04:09.190> watch<00:04:09.340> here<00:04:09.639> you

00:04:09.809 --> 00:04:09.819 
it larger so if you watch here you

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:11.670 
it larger so if you watch here you
realize<00:04:10.120> it<00:04:10.299> you<00:04:10.450> always<00:04:10.720> see<00:04:11.079> here<00:04:11.440> and<00:04:11.620> you

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:11.680 
realize it you always see here and you

00:04:11.680 --> 00:04:13.199 
realize it you always see here and you
always<00:04:11.950> see<00:04:12.250> earlier<00:04:12.549> part<00:04:12.819> of<00:04:12.849> my<00:04:12.940> hands

00:04:13.199 --> 00:04:13.209 
always see earlier part of my hands

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:16.380 
always see earlier part of my hands
there<00:04:13.540> but<00:04:14.409> it<00:04:14.590> just<00:04:14.830> shrinks<00:04:15.700> it<00:04:15.819> that's<00:04:16.120> all

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:16.390 
there but it just shrinks it that's all

00:04:16.390 --> 00:04:17.849 
there but it just shrinks it that's all
it<00:04:16.720> does<00:04:16.750> it

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:17.859 
it does it

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:21.659 
it does it
just<00:04:18.069> shrinks<00:04:18.789> it<00:04:18.849> a<00:04:19.000> little<00:04:19.120> bit<00:04:19.439> see<00:04:20.439> okay<00:04:21.129> so

00:04:21.659 --> 00:04:21.669 
just shrinks it a little bit see okay so

00:04:21.669 --> 00:04:22.890 
just shrinks it a little bit see okay so
that's<00:04:21.819> how<00:04:21.939> you<00:04:22.000> create<00:04:22.150> that<00:04:22.300> guy's<00:04:22.599> hope

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:22.900 
that's how you create that guy's hope

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:24.510 
that's how you create that guy's hope
