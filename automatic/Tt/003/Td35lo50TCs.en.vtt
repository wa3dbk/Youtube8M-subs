I like to show you my own simple way add

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:28.759 
I like to show you my own simple way add
some<00:00:24.960> stock<00:00:25.289> inside<00:00:26.010> the<00:00:26.220> ports<00:00:26.670> and<00:00:27.529> allow<00:00:28.529> it

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:28.769 
some stock inside the ports and allow it

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:31.700 
some stock inside the ports and allow it
to<00:00:28.800> come<00:00:29.250> to<00:00:29.519> a<00:00:29.550> boil<00:00:29.910> it's<00:00:30.289> best<00:00:31.289> to<00:00:31.560> use

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:31.710 
to come to a boil it's best to use

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:35.630 
to come to a boil it's best to use
chicken<00:00:32.279> or<00:00:32.700> turkey<00:00:33.030> stock<00:00:34.100> once<00:00:35.100> the<00:00:35.340> stock

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640 
chicken or turkey stock once the stock

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:41.720 
chicken or turkey stock once the stock
is<00:00:35.850> boiled<00:00:36.360> add<00:00:36.800> the<00:00:37.800> parboiled<00:00:38.250> rice<00:00:38.430> and<00:00:40.730> the

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:41.730 
is boiled add the parboiled rice and the

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:44.150 
is boiled add the parboiled rice and the
reason<00:00:42.059> for<00:00:42.270> this<00:00:42.510> is<00:00:42.840> to<00:00:42.899> allow<00:00:43.410> the<00:00:43.469> rice<00:00:43.920> to

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:44.160 
reason for this is to allow the rice to

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.910 
reason for this is to allow the rice to
absorb<00:00:44.219> some<00:00:44.820> flavor<00:00:45.239> from<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:45.809> stock<00:00:46.110> if<00:00:46.440> you

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
absorb some flavor from the stock if you

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.670 
absorb some flavor from the stock if you
add<00:00:47.129> excess<00:00:47.640> top<00:00:47.969> the<00:00:48.390> rice<00:00:48.600> will<00:00:48.930> be<00:00:48.960> too<00:00:49.320> soft

add excess top the rice will be too soft

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:57.500 
add excess top the rice will be too soft
