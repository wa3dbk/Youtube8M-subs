punctured<00:04:11.130> his<00:04:11.280> aorta<00:04:11.730> which<00:04:11.849> means<00:04:12.209> he<00:04:12.359> could

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.510 
punctured his aorta which means he could

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:14.990 
punctured his aorta which means he could
have<00:04:12.660> bled<00:04:12.900> out<00:04:12.959> internally<00:04:13.549> so<00:04:14.549> he<00:04:14.760> missed

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:15.000 
have bled out internally so he missed

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.110
