let's<00:00:40.020> talk<00:00:40.230> about<00:00:40.379> the<00:00:40.620> first<00:00:40.860> leg<00:00:41.160> of<00:00:41.190> the

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:41.340 
let's talk about the first leg of the

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.240 
let's talk about the first leg of the
stool<00:00:41.610> how<00:00:42.180> your<00:00:42.360> body<00:00:42.570> works<00:00:43.160> the<00:00:44.160> other

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250 
stool how your body works the other

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.650 
stool how your body works the other
thing<00:00:44.460> it's<00:00:44.610> odd<00:00:44.789> that<00:00:45.090> most<00:00:45.300> of<00:00:45.420> us<00:00:45.510> have

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:45.660 
thing it's odd that most of us have

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.200 
thing it's odd that most of us have
never<00:00:45.870> had<00:00:46.019> body<00:00:46.320> awareness<00:00:46.589> training<00:00:47.250> the

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:48.210 
never had body awareness training the

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.240 
never had body awareness training the
truth<00:00:48.480> is<00:00:48.780> without<00:00:49.110> understanding<00:00:49.559> how<00:00:50.039> this

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
truth is without understanding how this

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.850 
truth is without understanding how this
operates<00:00:50.940> how<00:00:51.600> do<00:00:51.660> we<00:00:51.839> ever<00:00:52.050> expect<00:00:52.649> to<00:00:52.739> be

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
operates how do we ever expect to be

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.549 
operates how do we ever expect to be
able<00:00:52.949> to<00:00:53.070> translate<00:00:53.519> our<00:00:53.760> musical<00:00:54.269> ideas<00:00:54.839> into

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559 
able to translate our musical ideas into

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:58.819 
able to translate our musical ideas into
physical<00:00:56.100> execution<00:00:56.850> at<00:00:56.970> the<00:00:57.089> piano<00:00:57.649> so<00:00:58.649> let's

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
physical execution at the piano so let's

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.350 
physical execution at the piano so let's
talk<00:00:58.979> about<00:00:59.040> what<00:00:59.489> is<00:00:59.579> it<00:00:59.699> that<00:00:59.729> we<00:00:59.940> need<00:01:00.059> to<00:01:00.210> do

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:00.360 
talk about what is it that we need to do

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.509 
talk about what is it that we need to do
to<00:01:00.540> get<00:01:00.690> to<00:01:00.839> know<00:01:00.960> how<00:01:01.199> this<00:01:01.589> part<00:01:01.979> of<00:01:02.100> us<00:01:02.219> works

00:01:02.509 --> 00:01:02.519 
to get to know how this part of us works

00:01:02.519 --> 00:01:04.700 
to get to know how this part of us works
what<00:01:03.299> we're<00:01:03.449> going<00:01:03.600> to<00:01:03.659> do<00:01:03.839> is<00:01:04.110> we're<00:01:04.559> going<00:01:04.589> to

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:04.710 
what we're going to do is we're going to

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:07.130 
what we're going to do is we're going to
take<00:01:04.920> each<00:01:05.159> body<00:01:05.519> part<00:01:05.880> that<00:01:06.180> contributes<00:01:06.960> to

take each body part that contributes to

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:09.380 
take each body part that contributes to
piano<00:01:07.350> playing<00:01:07.799> and<00:01:08.790> we're<00:01:08.940> going<00:01:09.090> to<00:01:09.119> study

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:09.390 
piano playing and we're going to study

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.450 
piano playing and we're going to study
them<00:01:09.690> in<00:01:09.720> isolation<00:01:10.350> we're<00:01:10.950> going<00:01:11.070> to<00:01:11.130> look<00:01:11.280> at

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
them in isolation we're going to look at

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:14.029 
them in isolation we're going to look at
the<00:01:11.970> types<00:01:12.270> of<00:01:12.450> motions<00:01:12.990> the<00:01:13.350> ranges<00:01:13.979> of

00:01:14.029 --> 00:01:14.039 
the types of motions the ranges of

00:01:14.039 --> 00:01:17.889 
the types of motions the ranges of

what motions are comfortable in which
motions<00:01:20.759> are<00:01:20.880> not<00:01:21.060> then<00:01:22.050> when<00:01:22.229> we're<00:01:22.350> done

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
motions are not then when we're done

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:24.469 
motions are not then when we're done
with<00:01:22.890> studying<00:01:23.280> each<00:01:23.429> part<00:01:23.729> in<00:01:23.819> isolation

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
with studying each part in isolation

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:25.490 
with studying each part in isolation
what<00:01:24.720> we're<00:01:24.840> going<00:01:24.960> to<00:01:24.990> do<00:01:25.140> is<00:01:25.229> we're<00:01:25.350> going<00:01:25.440> to

put it all together and we're going to

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.969 
put it all together and we're going to
look<00:01:27.149> at<00:01:27.330> how<00:01:27.450> it<00:01:27.569> behaves<00:01:27.899> as<00:01:28.200> an<00:01:28.409> integrated

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
look at how it behaves as an integrated

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.490 
look at how it behaves as an integrated
whole<00:01:29.929> what<00:01:30.929> you're<00:01:31.020> going<00:01:31.140> to<00:01:31.200> do<00:01:31.289> is<00:01:31.380> you're

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:31.500 
whole what you're going to do is you're

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.620

going to experience first hand with both
desirable<00:01:34.590> and<00:01:34.830> undesirable<00:01:35.210> motions<00:01:36.210> look

00:01:36.529 --> 00:01:36.539 
desirable and undesirable motions look

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:38.570 
desirable and undesirable motions look
like<00:01:36.780> and<00:01:37.110> especially<00:01:37.770> you're<00:01:38.399> going<00:01:38.520> to

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
to discover that you have a lot of

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.940 
to discover that you have a lot of
unconscious<00:01:47.579> sources<00:01:48.180> of<00:01:48.479> unnecessary

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:48.950 
unconscious sources of unnecessary

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.490 
unconscious sources of unnecessary
tension<00:01:49.950> and<00:01:50.189> wasted<00:01:51.180> motion<00:01:51.390> and<00:01:51.840> what<00:01:52.380> we're

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
tension and wasted motion and what we're

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.200 
tension and wasted motion and what we're
going<00:01:52.590> to<00:01:52.649> do<00:01:52.890> is<00:01:53.159> in<00:01:53.310> this<00:01:53.460> process<00:01:53.700> we're

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
going to do is in this process we're

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:55.940 
going to do is in this process we're
simply<00:01:54.600> going<00:01:54.960> to<00:01:55.110> become<00:01:55.439> aware<00:01:55.680> of<00:01:55.799> those

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:55.950 
simply going to become aware of those

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:57.889 
simply going to become aware of those
and<00:01:56.250> in<00:01:56.700> that<00:01:56.880> awareness<00:01:57.030> we're<00:01:57.719> going<00:01:57.840> to

00:01:57.889 --> 00:01:57.899 
and in that awareness we're going to

00:01:57.899 --> 00:01:59.929 
and in that awareness we're going to
gently<00:01:58.229> eliminate<00:01:58.829> those<00:01:59.070> things<00:01:59.430> from<00:01:59.729> our

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
gently eliminate those things from our

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:02.240 
gently eliminate those things from our
playing
