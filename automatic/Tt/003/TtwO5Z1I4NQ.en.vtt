00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.149
 yes the morning 

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:11.120
 Good morning, I greet you from the 

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:14.990
 prosperity today I want to make a 

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:16.570
 reflection regarding quality time 

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:19.250
 that we are not dedicating 

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:21.320
 probably to our family and I want 

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:23.090
 make a reflection using this tape 

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:26.180
 I have here that we go so 

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:27.070
 represents the years the life of any 

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:29.810
 person 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:32.570
 suppose that an average person 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:34.190
 good 100 years would be ideal to live 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:37.730
 not personally I aspire to live 100 

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:39.740
 years and now let's look at one thing the 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.780
 Most of us here are going to 

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:43.250
 say that we are going to live let's make a 

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:45.920
 little optimists we believe that the 

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:49.399
 average life in colombia let's say that 

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:51.260
 it's 75 years we 're going to get this part 

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:53.329
 here that either these years of 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:55.700
 probably not not going to live on 

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:57.920
 this part I've already lost here there's another 

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.590
 part let's say that most people 

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:02.059
 who is now watching this message 

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:04.159
 let's say that most have van I spoke 

00:01:02.059 --> 00:01:07.130
 of 25-30 Well let's be a 

00:01:04.159 --> 00:01:09.200
 a little like balanced 35 years 

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.979
 let's say that most people with 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.820
 what we are seeing this message 

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:14.900
 we have 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:17.180
 he gave 35 years in this time already lost 

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:20.030
 this is more or less the time that we 

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:21.770
 it remains of life let's analyze how long 

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:23.660
 we are going to dedicate this from this that we 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:25.340
 is how much time we have left for 

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:28.250
 our family 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:30.890
 if an average person sleeps 8 hours 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:33.800
 all they are talking about a third of 

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:35.390
 this life is going to be spent sleeping but 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:38.060
 and to this part let's say that this part already 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:40.850
 it was this part since we are not going to 

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.980
 dedicate to the family there is another part the 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.990
 another part 8 hours working truth 

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:47.300
 Well, let's assume that this part is already 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.860
 he left because they are 8 hours working 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:51.500
 where we are not going to dedicate time to 

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:53.960
 our family finally we have left 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.790
 this small space for the family does not 

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.260
 we passed her suddenly watching television 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:01:58.700
 then watching television or on the internet 

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:00.170
 so let's say that this is the 

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:03.650
 time the TV is dedicated or the 

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:06.020
 internet and probably going to parties 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:08.240
 being playing I do not know is a sport a 

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.380
 constant you lose another part here the 

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:11.180
 time we last at the traffic lights 

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:14.810
 probably at the traffic light you lose 

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:16.790
 another time and ultimately it is very little 

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.400
 the time that we are dedicating to 

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.260
 our children to our partner 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:21.980
 the reflection today is that we go back to 

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:25.790
 return 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:27.830
 this time these valuable years of this 

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:29.420
 time that we are dedicating to things 

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:30.620
 less important let's dedicate time 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:32.480
 our family the short time that 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.040
 let 's have a little space that 

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.019
 we have the family dedicate the 

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:37.549
 soon quality time you do not 

00:02:36.019 --> 00:02:40.010
 has quantity time but yes 

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:42.140
 quality then I recommend you to dedicate 

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.810
 time to your children to your wife to your 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:46.580
 family to the base of society that 

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:49.220
 we are really losing your little ones 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:52.209
 those great values in our house that 

00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:52.209
 have a wonderful day 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.250
 when sharing
