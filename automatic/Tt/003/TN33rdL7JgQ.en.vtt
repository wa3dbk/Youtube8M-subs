00:00:51.529 --> 00:00:51.539 
idea going into the video how intense it

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.279 
idea going into the video how intense it
would<00:00:51.660> be<00:00:51.840> and<00:00:52.079> all<00:00:53.010> I<00:00:53.070> knew<00:00:53.489> is<00:00:53.520> that<00:00:54.199> that<00:00:55.199> it

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
would be and all I knew is that that it

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.290 
would be and all I knew is that that it
would<00:00:55.410> be<00:00:55.559> interesting<00:00:56.460> and<00:00:56.610> different<00:00:56.789> but

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300 
would be interesting and different but

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.790 
would be interesting and different but
going<00:00:57.719> on<00:00:57.809> going<00:00:57.960> into<00:00:58.230> it<00:00:58.350> we<00:00:58.410> thought<00:00:58.440> maybe

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:58.800 
going on going into it we thought maybe

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.920 
going on going into it we thought maybe
tops<00:00:59.430> it<00:00:59.670> would<00:00:59.789> take<00:01:00.000> three<00:01:00.270> months<00:01:00.510> which

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
tops it would take three months which

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:03.740 
tops it would take three months which
was<00:01:01.289> already<00:01:01.649> like<00:01:01.859> that<00:01:02.850> is<00:01:03.059> a<00:01:03.090> really<00:01:03.420> long

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:03.750 
was already like that is a really long

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.719 
was already like that is a really long
time<00:01:04.049> and<00:01:04.110> then<00:01:04.559> three<00:01:04.890> months<00:01:05.040> happened<00:01:05.549> and

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
time and then three months happened and

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.030 
time and then three months happened and
it<00:01:05.820> was<00:01:05.970> like<00:01:06.150> maybe<00:01:06.810> the<00:01:07.200> director<00:01:07.650> did<00:01:07.860> this

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
it was like maybe the director did this

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.100 
it was like maybe the director did this
so<00:01:08.250> we<00:01:08.369> didn't<00:01:08.640> freak<00:01:08.939> out<00:01:09.119> but<00:01:09.420> like<00:01:09.750> we<00:01:09.930> never

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:10.110 
so we didn't freak out but like we never

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.020 
so we didn't freak out but like we never
calculated<00:01:10.770> how<00:01:11.159> long<00:01:11.369> would<00:01:11.520> actually<00:01:11.850> take

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030 
calculated how long would actually take

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.280 
calculated how long would actually take
because<00:01:12.240> I<00:01:12.360> think<00:01:12.570> it<00:01:12.659> would<00:01:12.750> have<00:01:12.840> scared<00:01:12.960> us

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:13.290 
because I think it would have scared us

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.140 
because I think it would have scared us
all<00:01:13.500> so<00:01:13.770> we<00:01:13.920> just<00:01:14.070> kind<00:01:14.280> of<00:01:14.369> kept<00:01:14.610> checking<00:01:14.880> if

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150
