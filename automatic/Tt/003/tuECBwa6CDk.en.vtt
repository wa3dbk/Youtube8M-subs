00:02:15.970 --> 00:02:15.980 
something that I wanted to mention is if

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.550

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.450 
a store or something like that I would

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:23.410 
a store or something like that I would
suggest<00:02:20.660> starting<00:02:21.020> with<00:02:21.520> local<00:02:22.520> stores<00:02:22.790> maybe

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
suggest starting with local stores maybe

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:25.479 
suggest starting with local stores maybe
where<00:02:23.660> you<00:02:23.840> happen<00:02:24.230> to<00:02:24.380> know<00:02:24.680> the<00:02:24.890> owners<00:02:25.280> or

00:02:25.479 --> 00:02:25.489 
where you happen to know the owners or

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:26.860 
where you happen to know the owners or
something<00:02:25.760> like<00:02:25.880> that<00:02:25.940> especially<00:02:26.630> if<00:02:26.720> you

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:26.870 
something like that especially if you

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:28.660 
something like that especially if you
were<00:02:26.989> of<00:02:27.140> a<00:02:27.290> younger<00:02:27.650> age<00:02:27.680> because<00:02:28.400> a<00:02:28.430> lot<00:02:28.640> of

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:28.670 
were of a younger age because a lot of

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:32.229 
were of a younger age because a lot of
bigger<00:02:29.150> more<00:02:29.720> corporate<00:02:30.560> companies<00:02:31.459> that

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:32.239 
bigger more corporate companies that

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:32.920 
bigger more corporate companies that
makes<00:02:32.510> sense

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:32.930 
makes sense

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:38.680 
makes sense
um<00:02:33.290> tend<00:02:34.099> to<00:02:34.340> have<00:02:34.580> a<00:02:34.970> higher<00:02:35.720> age<00:02:37.180> minimum<00:02:38.180> for

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:38.690 
um tend to have a higher age minimum for

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:40.660 
um tend to have a higher age minimum for
you<00:02:38.810> to<00:02:39.140> work<00:02:39.680> for<00:02:39.890> them<00:02:39.950> a<00:02:40.220> lot<00:02:40.430> of<00:02:40.519> times

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:40.670 
you to work for them a lot of times

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.780 
you to work for them a lot of times
that's<00:02:40.849> like<00:02:41.030> 1718<00:02:41.989> maybe<00:02:42.349> 16<00:02:42.800> so<00:02:43.340> if<00:02:43.550> you<00:02:43.640> are

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
that's like 1718 maybe 16 so if you are

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:45.160 
that's like 1718 maybe 16 so if you are
under<00:02:43.970> that<00:02:44.209> age<00:02:44.420> I<00:02:44.630> definitely<00:02:45.019> suggest

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170 
under that age I definitely suggest

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:46.720 
under that age I definitely suggest
trying<00:02:45.650> to<00:02:45.769> find<00:02:45.920> a<00:02:46.010> local<00:02:46.250> store<00:02:46.549> where<00:02:46.700> you

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:46.730 
trying to find a local store where you

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:48.729 
trying to find a local store where you
live<00:02:46.970> and<00:02:47.209> you<00:02:47.930> know<00:02:48.019> going<00:02:48.230> there<00:02:48.500> first

00:02:48.729 --> 00:02:48.739 
live and you know going there first

00:02:48.739 --> 00:02:50.830 
live and you know going there first
because<00:02:49.130> in<00:02:49.340> my<00:02:49.700> opinion<00:02:50.120> from<00:02:50.269> what<00:02:50.360> I<00:02:50.480> found

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:50.840 
because in my opinion from what I found

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.930 
because in my opinion from what I found
they<00:02:51.380> will<00:02:51.530> probably<00:02:51.769> be<00:02:52.040> more<00:02:52.400> likely<00:02:52.580> tire

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:52.940 
they will probably be more likely tire

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.229 
they will probably be more likely tire
you<00:02:53.209> than<00:02:53.540> like<00:02:54.350> another<00:02:55.130> larger<00:02:55.819> company

00:02:56.229 --> 00:02:56.239 
you than like another larger company

00:02:56.239 --> 00:02:57.640 
you than like another larger company

house kids you pay me for that and you'd

00:06:48.919 --> 00:06:50.230 
house kids you pay me for that and you'd
be<00:06:49.100> spread<00:06:49.340> because<00:06:49.550> a<00:06:49.580> lot<00:06:49.760> of<00:06:49.790> parents<00:06:50.030> don't

00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:50.240

you you never know what they and I'm

00:06:53.570 --> 00:06:55.300 
you you never know what they and I'm
pretty<00:06:53.810> sure<00:06:53.930> I<00:06:54.050> had<00:06:54.350> another<00:06:54.620> idea<00:06:54.979> on<00:06:55.040> how<00:06:55.280> to

00:06:55.300 --> 00:06:55.310 
pretty sure I had another idea on how to

00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:57.550 
pretty sure I had another idea on how to
make<00:06:55.430> money<00:06:55.790> but<00:06:56.389> suddenly<00:06:57.139> I<00:06:57.169> cannot

00:06:57.550 --> 00:06:57.560 
make money but suddenly I cannot

remember<00:06:57.860> it<00:06:58.130> I<00:06:58.250> probably<00:06:58.520> should<00:06:58.880> have<00:06:58.910> like

00:06:59.110 --> 00:06:59.120 
remember it I probably should have like

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:00.580 
remember it I probably should have like
written<00:06:59.389> these<00:06:59.479> down<00:06:59.540> somewhere<00:07:00.020> but<00:07:00.290> they

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:00.590 
written these down somewhere but they

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:02.290 
written these down somewhere but they
were<00:07:00.650> just<00:07:00.800> kind<00:07:00.949> of<00:07:01.010> stored<00:07:01.310> in<00:07:01.400> my<00:07:01.490> brain<00:07:01.729> so

00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:02.300 
were just kind of stored in my brain so

00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:04.840 
were just kind of stored in my brain so
if<00:07:02.690> I<00:07:02.840> do<00:07:02.900> happen<00:07:03.260> to<00:07:03.440> remember<00:07:03.949> my<00:07:04.400> last<00:07:04.550> idea

00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:04.850
