00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.339
 in the district of mino in the province 

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:08.100
 from quang binh you will find a poverty 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:11.370
 extreme that forces children to 

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:14.190
 to cross a deep-water river to 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.619
 be able to get to school this is a 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.779
 situation that is repeated in some 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:22.039
 points of planet earth there are some 

00:00:18.779 --> 00:00:24.630
 places where to go to school 

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:27.689
 you have to put your own risk 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:30.449
 life apparently this region is so poor 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:33.240
 you can not afford to 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:35.910
 build a bridge to cross the river 

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:38.850
 so that if a child wants to go to 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:42.270
 school to receive the basic classes of 

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:45.480
 primary will have to get into the river and if 

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:49.600
 the current is very strong because you can 

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:52.469
 be drowned and may die in the attempt 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:56.350
 a rather exasperating situation 

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:59.460
 imagine trying to close your eyes and 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:59.460
 put yourself in their place 

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:06.060
 you would say to the school under those conditions 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:09.180
 that is if right now human beings 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:11.490
 in developed countries we complain about 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:15.690
 go to school with all the amenities 

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:18.420
 that there are transports and others think 

00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:21.000
 that zaccarÃ­a is willpower for 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:24.000
 to cross this river and play life 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:26.970
 for a few classes then surely 

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.070
 notwithstanding these children have 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.360
 demonstrated his true desire for 

00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.149
 to learn 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:35.970
 I hope many people will copy the example 

00:01:33.149 --> 00:01:37.590
 moral of these children I have put a 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.200
 example as I said but in 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.840
 actually these cases are scattered by 

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.509
 all the planet earth we are 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:47.039
 in Africa we meet in China the 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:50.160
 we found in some areas of america 

00:01:47.039 --> 00:01:52.080
 also and even in some areas of 

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:55.560
 Europe 

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:59.070
 children who have to walk 34 hours to 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:02.280
 day they have to put their life under 

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:04.650
 danger to be able to go to school in 

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.140
 In this case, these children have to 

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:09.619
 to cross a river of more than 3 meters of 

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:13.020
 depth with strong currents 

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:15.570
 holding in a bag with a bag 

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.580
 more or less hermetic plastic then 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:20.870
 the things that they carry like for example the 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:25.100
 food and others a quite situation 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:25.100
 regrettable that I should change
