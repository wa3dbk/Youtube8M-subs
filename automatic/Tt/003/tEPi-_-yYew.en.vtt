 rome and is between eni and three favorites seen 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:15.179

 manga the name of the manga of the same name though 

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:19.080
 found the original title then now 

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:21.539
 I will destroy it for you students 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:23.789
 you start the Japanese for practicability 

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:25.730
 hand the authors of what this speaks 

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:27.480
 bari film so far speaks of takata 

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.730
 played by the beautiful actor 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.289
 just too much pillows I stayed there with 

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.780
 i also had a thumb on it all 

00:00:31.289 --> 00:00:36.450
 watching the film because it is beautiful 

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:37.800
 touch a boy to us in everyday life 

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:40.110
 in the days that go on forever 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.180
 the same that he introduced so well known 

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.579
 world of the day one of his lives will change 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.370
 forever the professor immediately 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.989
 turns into the rome doll after 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:51.149
 play a game in the Latin section 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:54.660
 field stigliano ready and 36 the base 

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.670
 It presents a priest whose monitor 123 

00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.590
 stem and verigy while on the other side 

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:01.079
 when someone puts it you are 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.780
 turn it moves you are eliminated and what it is 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:06.000
 the same thing the fear does 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:07.650
 rubo turns around and the people do 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.979
 are moving beyond eliminated stores 

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.780
 from the game they explode and die like this 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.939
 you want to regenerate that this movie knows that 

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:18.270
 we do not see the blood between states 

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:21.570
 elevated but the bodies are made by spere 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.549
 sturdy shoulders and not defined blood one 

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:25.350
 try the other on the battle style 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.119
 royale or hunger games 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.340
 one of the things I liked best 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:31.650
 of this film is its own mix of genres 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.869
 a bit of teen drama a bit of survival 

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:35.549
 horror a bit of splatter and a bit of 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:37.259
 kreisler changes in my opinion there is a bit of 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:39.240
 trailer because until the end not 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.950
 we know well where if going to parry 

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.840
 this film is something I liked 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.399
 so much this movie to grow 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.619
 attention however not at the same time 

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.259
 never forget carmine of irony and it is me 

00:01:46.619 --> 00:01:50.640
 very much liked the kind of irony 

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:52.530
 used that we reflect a little all the 

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.110
 film a bit of sarcasm a little bit of 

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:57.090
 something vaguely insane something 

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:59.110
 who does lightly smiles as he mentions a 

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.850
 quid in the highest is taken me at times 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.380
 this mix because the film is like this is like 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.090
 if he was walking on a line of 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:07.060
 very dangerous border between the 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:08.560
 insane is something possible is one 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:11.230
 very dangerous line this film 

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.270
 fully manages to stay there on that 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.890
 small piece of line then 

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:16.360
 obviously my film tension has 

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:18.850
 also given by the character since 

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.950
 protagonist now was my love and 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:22.480
 so I was seeing it calculating well 

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.420
 depending on how the film would have ended 

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:27.820
 you write Romanian ata cascini che tipo 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:30.130
 misery must die only those 9gb 

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:31.810
 which obviously I won't tell you if I've written 

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:33.820
 the cascini that or not because there is not 

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.440
 I want to spoil the ending of these 

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:37.060
 very attached to see who signed home 

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.860
 he found it very funny he has me 

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.290
 I grew up a lot and I wanted to 

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.060
 see a thousand more times and not just for 

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:45.070
 I loved the actor too 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.890
 the acting and as it must be said moves 

00:02:45.070 --> 00:02:50.200
 always on that thin line the costumes 

00:02:47.890 --> 00:02:51.970
 or my god lived as a schoolgirl and 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.250
 could come true my dream of 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:55.450
 dress like mister vance 

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:59.530
 I therefore vote for this bill maher 

00:02:55.450 --> 00:03:00.430
