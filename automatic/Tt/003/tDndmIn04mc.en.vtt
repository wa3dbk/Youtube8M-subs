00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:13.860 
did choose to go with a 1b just because

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.160 
did choose to go with a 1b just because
it's<00:01:14.130> it's<00:01:14.400> more<00:01:14.790> of<00:01:14.880> a<00:01:14.970> natural<00:01:15.570> I<00:01:15.750> like<00:01:15.960> the

jet black but I'm used to the 1b so I

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.649 
jet black but I'm used to the 1b so I
went<00:01:19.799> back<00:01:19.950> to<00:01:19.979> a<00:01:20.130> 1b<00:01:20.490> with<00:01:20.700> this<00:01:20.880> one<00:01:21.119> and<00:01:21.390> I'm

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:21.659 
went back to a 1b with this one and I'm

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:23.890 
went back to a 1b with this one and I'm
glad<00:01:21.900> that<00:01:21.930> I<00:01:22.170> did<00:01:22.409> because<00:01:22.500> it's<00:01:22.979> not<00:01:23.189> as

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:23.900 
glad that I did because it's not as

doesn't<00:01:24.900> have<00:01:25.049> that<00:01:25.229> like<00:01:25.470> shiny<00:01:25.950> look<00:01:26.340> when

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:26.580 
doesn't have that like shiny look when

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:29.149 
doesn't have that like shiny look when
you<00:01:26.700> get<00:01:26.850> jet<00:01:27.420> black<00:01:27.720> units<00:01:28.229> you<00:01:28.380> always<00:01:28.860> have

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
you get jet black units you always have

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.240 
you get jet black units you always have
you<00:01:30.000> always<00:01:30.390> worry<00:01:30.630> about<00:01:30.720> that<00:01:31.140> shiny<00:01:31.890> effect

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:32.250 
you always worry about that shiny effect

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:34.520 
you always worry about that shiny effect
that<00:01:32.759> they<00:01:32.909> have<00:01:33.119> and<00:01:33.570> you<00:01:33.840> know<00:01:34.110> the<00:01:34.229> texture

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:34.530 
that they have and you know the texture

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:36.469 
that they have and you know the texture
could<00:01:34.770> be<00:01:34.890> yaki<00:01:35.340> but<00:01:35.520> it<00:01:35.610> still<00:01:35.880> looks<00:01:36.270> really

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
could be yaki but it still looks really

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:39.950 
could be yaki but it still looks really
really<00:01:37.350> shiny<00:01:37.650> like<00:01:38.460> overly<00:01:39.030> shiny<00:01:39.270> sometimes

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:39.960 
really shiny like overly shiny sometimes

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.050 
really shiny like overly shiny sometimes
so<00:01:40.470> I'm<00:01:40.799> glad<00:01:41.009> that<00:01:41.130> I<00:01:41.369> got<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.670> one<00:01:41.850> being

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:42.060 
so I'm glad that I got the one being

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.630 
so I'm glad that I got the one being
this<00:01:42.329> because<00:01:42.659> it<00:01:42.990> looks<00:01:43.290> very<00:01:43.649> natural<00:01:43.979> to<00:01:44.430> me

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:44.640 
this because it looks very natural to me

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.670 
this because it looks very natural to me
if<00:01:45.000> it<00:01:45.180> looks<00:01:45.390> a<00:01:45.479> little<00:01:45.570> high<00:01:45.840> it's<00:01:46.259> probably

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:46.680 
if it looks a little high it's probably

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.560 
if it looks a little high it's probably
because<00:01:46.950> I'm<00:01:47.159> wearing<00:01:47.189> a<00:01:47.579> twist<00:01:47.820> out<00:01:48.000> right

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:48.570 
because I'm wearing a twist out right

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:51.260
