often tight ends never had any time to

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.679 
often tight ends never had any time to
work<00:01:43.860> on<00:01:44.009> assignments<00:01:44.189> with<00:01:44.939> the<00:01:45.119> offensive

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
work on assignments with the offensive

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.260 
work on assignments with the offensive
line<00:01:45.720> we<00:01:46.619> do<00:01:46.770> a<00:01:46.799> tremendous<00:01:47.130> amount<00:01:47.820> of<00:01:47.909> double

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
line we do a tremendous amount of double

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.060 
line we do a tremendous amount of double
teaming<00:01:48.630> so<00:01:48.930> we'll<00:01:49.079> work<00:01:49.229> our<00:01:49.409> tight<00:01:49.649> ends<00:01:49.920> and

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:50.070 
teaming so we'll work our tight ends and

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.859 
teaming so we'll work our tight ends and
tackles<00:01:50.490> double<00:01:50.790> teaming<00:01:51.119> our<00:01:51.270> guards<00:01:51.689> and

00:01:51.859 --> 00:01:51.869 
tackles double teaming our guards and

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:54.109 
tackles double teaming our guards and
tackles<00:01:52.290> together<00:01:52.619> double<00:01:52.979> teaming<00:01:53.369> and<00:01:53.490> then

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
tackles together double teaming and then

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.910 
tackles together double teaming and then
why<00:01:54.240> have<00:01:54.390> a<00:01:54.450> just<00:01:54.540> a<00:01:54.630> short<00:01:54.990> time<00:01:55.320> where<00:01:55.799> they

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:55.920 
why have a just a short time where they

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:57.859 
why have a just a short time where they
could<00:01:56.070> go<00:01:56.250> ahead<00:01:56.399> and<00:01:56.610> work<00:01:56.909> a<00:01:57.060> few<00:01:57.329> offensive

00:01:57.859 --> 00:01:57.869 
could go ahead and work a few offensive

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.569 
could go ahead and work a few offensive
play<00:01:58.229> so<00:01:58.290> they<00:01:58.680> know<00:01:58.829> their<00:01:58.979> assignments

00:01:59.569 --> 00:01:59.579 
play so they know their assignments

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:01.429 
play so they know their assignments

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
doing is we're working double teams

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.730

again<00:02:10.110> tightens<00:02:10.649> and<00:02:10.800> tackles<00:02:11.250> are<00:02:11.370> together

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:11.740 
again tightens and tackles are together

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:14.460 
again tightens and tackles are together
and<00:02:12.010> often<00:02:12.490> guards<00:02:13.030> and<00:02:13.380> tackles<00:02:14.380> are

together and our centers and guards

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:17.340 
together and our centers and guards
eventually<00:02:16.330> will<00:02:16.450> be<00:02:16.570> together<00:02:16.720> because

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:17.350 
eventually will be together because

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:18.960 
eventually will be together because
again<00:02:17.590> we<00:02:17.710> do<00:02:17.860> a<00:02:17.890> tremendous<00:02:18.160> amount<00:02:18.760> of

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970 
again we do a tremendous amount of

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:20.820 
again we do a tremendous amount of
different<00:02:19.600> types<00:02:19.780> of<00:02:19.930> double<00:02:20.230> teams<00:02:20.500> within

our running game most of our running

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.100 
our running game most of our running
game<00:02:22.900> is<00:02:23.260> based<00:02:23.590> on<00:02:24.420> having<00:02:25.420> a<00:02:25.480> double<00:02:25.690> team<00:02:25.960> at

game is based on having a double team at

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:27.780 
game is based on having a double team at
the<00:02:26.230> point<00:02:26.470> of<00:02:26.530> attack<00:02:26.650> will<00:02:27.490> do<00:02:27.610> that<00:02:27.760> for

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:27.790 
the point of attack will do that for

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.760 
the point of attack will do that for
probably<00:02:28.120> six<00:02:28.630> to<00:02:28.780> seven<00:02:29.260> minutes<00:02:29.560> in<00:02:29.680> the

explosion drill here we have some bags

00:04:23.140 --> 00:04:25.020 
explosion drill here we have some bags
it's<00:04:23.500> kind<00:04:23.650> of<00:04:23.680> a<00:04:23.800> ball<00:04:24.010> security<00:04:24.490> and<00:04:24.880> we

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.030 
it's kind of a ball security and we

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:25.350 
it's kind of a ball security and we

the midline if we weren't running option
I'd<00:04:36.879> have<00:04:37.090> probably<00:04:37.360> a<00:04:37.629> lot<00:04:37.870> of<00:04:37.990> the<00:04:38.080> backfield

00:04:38.459 --> 00:04:38.469 
I'd have probably a lot of the backfield

00:04:38.469 --> 00:04:40.619 
I'd have probably a lot of the backfield
together<00:04:38.770> working<00:04:39.069> on<00:04:39.310> the<00:04:39.430> time<00:04:39.729> timing<00:04:40.539> on

the<00:04:40.750> offensive<00:04:41.139> running<00:04:41.620> plays<00:04:41.889> I've<00:04:42.430> often

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:42.669 
the offensive running plays I've often

00:04:42.669 --> 00:04:44.520 
the offensive running plays I've often
found<00:04:43.030> it<00:04:43.240> interesting<00:04:43.479> how<00:04:43.810> many<00:04:44.050> teams<00:04:44.289> will

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:44.530 
found it interesting how many teams will

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:46.320 
found it interesting how many teams will
turn<00:04:44.740> the<00:04:44.889> ball<00:04:45.099> over<00:04:45.129> not<00:04:45.729> because<00:04:46.120> of<00:04:46.150> a

great<00:04:46.569> hit<00:04:46.840> but<00:04:47.469> because<00:04:47.830> things<00:04:48.129> are<00:04:48.310> not

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:48.490 
great hit but because things are not

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:51.439 
great hit but because things are not
timed<00:04:48.969> up<00:04:49.270> between<00:04:49.900> their<00:04:50.439> running<00:04:50.770> backs<00:04:50.979> and
