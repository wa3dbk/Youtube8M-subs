 do with the ipad nothing but the ipad 

00:00:27.399 --> 00:00:31.570
 you will have to configure it in an amplitude 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:33.040
 of 2x to be able to see it but you can well 

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:34.480
 work without problems that 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.920
 application besides being free is what 

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.530
 that is very fashionable habitat in 

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:41.410
 instagram facebook on twitter you go to 

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:43.510
 to be able to make a kind of collage of 

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:45.250
 photos but include videos in addition to 

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:47.410

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:01.660
 that you can share we will give 

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:03.550
 Peak option the tool 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:05.409
 as such marks you the first option that 

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:07.540
 would be the collage of videos and photos 

00:01:05.409 --> 00:01:09.640
 here the images you have to record the 

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.920
 directly from the camera roll that is 

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.810
 we are recording this or videos that you have 

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:15.850
 your music or whatever you want 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.110
 installed on your device also the 

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:18.970
 music so that also 

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.230
 share I'm not going to use music to 

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:22.990
 not have copyright problems with the 

00:01:20.230 --> 00:01:25.690
 video and I'm going to make a collage of what 

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:27.640
 is not check the order in which you add 

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:29.910
 it's very important for example I'm going to 

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:33.070
 add now in this case my photos 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:35.320
 explaining that this is night and we are going to 

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:38.410
 give it here I'll give you the following 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:40.450
 image let's put this for example and 

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:42.880
 after this after the show we're going 

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:45.130
 to give the next one we are going to add a 

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:47.350
 video this video I have it added in 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:50.290
 red camera belgrade right now so that 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:52.330
 you have we are to show you 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:55.150
 you can make it smaller you can 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.680
 adjust so that the video adjusts to 

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:59.170
 the 15 seconds that you allow for 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:01.750
 example instagram let's add another 

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:03.880
 image more example we will add 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:07.210
 around here I had one at night geek 

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:09.250
 I already have night that we are going to give shows and 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:11.410
 let's add other images 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.840
 here it already depends a lot on the 

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:16.000
 creativity of each of each of 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.580
 us and between more images by 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.709
 logically it will look much more 

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.900
 there he will have more choice let's give him 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:24.670
 next I here I already have the only way that 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.950
 it's a test give a click to anyone 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.600
 of those links and you will be able to see them at night 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.160
 a greeting 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:32.930
 there is the video here you will have 

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.180
 to decide how they want the 

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:37.310
 appearance here come letters here 

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.500
 the advantages come as they are free 

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.030
 you can go adjusting it for example is 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.350
 very important the order in which you go 

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:46.760
 download for example here I liked how 

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:48.920
 you see let's put here you're here imac 

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.590
 mx this let's put here and geek night 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:53.450
 If you've already done to accommodate it 

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:56.030
 adjusted he remembers that the important thing in 

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:58.040
 this type of collage is much the order 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.170
 in which you go for example first photo 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.030
 second photo the video third photo 

00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:03.500
 fourth and fifth photo then you have 

00:03:02.030 --> 00:03:05.390
 to decide in what order is the difficult 

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:08.630
 in any case of the application we are going to 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:10.280
 give here a retics on radio that would be yes 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:12.470
 you want to move it if you want more 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.360
 square I'm better in square you 

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:15.860
 let's give next and here come some 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.290
 tools that you will be able to use 

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:20.150
 here the video has been loaded again 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:21.770
 hello how is that is a test give it a 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:24.440
 click on any of the links and 

00:03:21.770 --> 00:03:26.690
 you can see it but guys to the effect now 

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.880
 here appears the option of being that is 

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:30.950
 so you can add music 

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:33.800
 in the background I would give you that in this case 

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:36.050
 for example I do not like it is a complaint 

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:38.600
 of the video I can not lower the volume to 

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:41.030
 what is the video so that it only 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.980
 listen to the song or half 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:45.170
 audio as the voice of the person who 

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:47.270
 have the video you can put songs 

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:48.530
 at random I in this case right now I do not have 

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:50.660
 music loaded on my iphone that all 

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:51.650
 the or by spotify and the library 

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:53.810
 you will have to look 

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:55.700
 the bookstore since you've finished it 

00:03:53.810 --> 00:03:56.989
 you're going to give next here tells you there's 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:59.750
 some examples of what you can 

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:02.480
 add for example you can handle this 

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:05.239
 type of text you can add here or 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:07.129
 is it really has enough ways of 

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:11.260
 that you can for example here 

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:11.260

 let's give ok since it's over 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:19.590
 We can give previous not the sample to 

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:22.910
 anyone could really decide 

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:22.910

 found as if we were to instagram in 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:57.340

00:04:54.940 --> 00:04:59.290
 is to scale in this case what is 

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:00.810
 our image that we have in our 

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:03.250
