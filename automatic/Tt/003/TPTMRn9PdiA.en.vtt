is very important we're taking a look at
where<00:01:34.380> we're<00:01:34.560> taking<00:01:34.860> a<00:01:34.950> look<00:01:35.100> at<00:01:35.310> it<00:01:35.490> as<00:01:35.670> you

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
say well first of all I have to tell you

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.510 
say well first of all I have to tell you
they've<00:01:45.990> been<00:01:46.170> looking<00:01:46.979> at<00:01:47.100> this<00:01:47.250> for<00:01:47.310> the

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:47.520 
they've been looking at this for the

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.090 
they've been looking at this for the
past<00:01:47.670> six<00:01:48.000> months<00:01:48.240> and<00:01:48.509> the<00:01:49.049> the<00:01:49.350> answer<00:01:49.740> that

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
past six months and the the answer that

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.999 
past six months and the the answer that
they<00:01:50.220> gave<00:01:50.250> was<00:01:50.850> its<00:01:51.509> enigmatic<00:01:51.960> but<00:01:52.890> the

00:01:52.999 --> 00:01:53.009 
they gave was its enigmatic but the

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:55.490 
they gave was its enigmatic but the
seven<00:01:53.399> letters<00:01:53.790> are<00:01:54.600> very<00:01:54.930> important<00:01:55.409> because

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:55.500 
seven letters are very important because

00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.240 
seven letters are very important because
we<00:01:55.710> have<00:01:55.740> so<00:01:56.159> little<00:01:56.520> from<00:01:56.969> the<00:01:57.119> 10th<00:01:57.390> century

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:58.250 
we have so little from the 10th century

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.399 
we have so little from the 10th century
writing<00:01:59.250> writing<00:01:59.729> was<00:02:00.030> an<00:02:00.180> enormous<00:02:00.689> ly<00:02:01.079> new

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
writing writing was an enormous ly new

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:04.399 
writing writing was an enormous ly new

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
innovation for the ancient Israelites so

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.449 
innovation for the ancient Israelites so
we<00:02:04.590> found<00:02:04.920> in<00:02:05.130> the<00:02:05.219> past<00:02:05.869> decade<00:02:07.009> four<00:02:08.009> or<00:02:08.190> five

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:08.459 
we found in the past decade four or five

00:02:08.459 --> 00:02:11.390 
we found in the past decade four or five
major<00:02:09.030> finds<00:02:09.509> and<00:02:09.899> each<00:02:10.379> one<00:02:10.679> of<00:02:10.709> them<00:02:10.950> sort<00:02:11.280> of

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:11.400 
major finds and each one of them sort of

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.559 
major finds and each one of them sort of
adds<00:02:11.640> to<00:02:11.849> the<00:02:12.060> body<00:02:12.270> of<00:02:12.420> knowledge<00:02:12.510> but<00:02:13.319> this

00:02:13.559 --> 00:02:13.569 
adds to the body of knowledge but this

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:16.319 
adds to the body of knowledge but this
like<00:02:13.810> CSI<00:02:14.469> Jerusalem<00:02:15.340> they're<00:02:15.879> trying<00:02:16.239> to

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:16.329 
like CSI Jerusalem they're trying to

in real time and this perhaps explained

in real time and this perhaps explained
it<00:02:56.680> very<00:02:56.739> simply<00:02:57.689> could<00:02:58.689> prove<00:02:59.049> that<00:02:59.409> the<00:03:00.040> Old

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:00.219

well<00:03:04.030> the<00:03:04.299> the<00:03:04.540> main<00:03:04.750> point<00:03:05.379> is<00:03:05.709> that<00:03:06.099> when<00:03:06.489> you

00:03:06.599 --> 00:03:06.609 
well the the main point is that when you

00:03:10.439 --> 00:03:10.449 
century and you piece it together with

00:03:10.449 --> 00:03:12.539 
century and you piece it together with
other<00:03:10.689> artifacts<00:03:11.500> are<00:03:11.709> from<00:03:12.159> the<00:03:12.310> 10th

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:24.390 
ruling and each one of these little
pieces<00:03:22.780> contributes<00:03:23.500> to<00:03:23.650> the<00:03:23.739> whole<00:03:23.919> the

pieces contributes to the whole the

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.610 
pieces contributes to the whole the
problem<00:03:24.790> was<00:03:24.970> up<00:03:25.569> until<00:03:25.750> about<00:03:26.079> twenty<00:03:26.409> years

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:26.620

ago<00:03:26.739> we<00:03:27.189> had<00:03:27.310> so<00:03:27.699> little<00:03:27.729> that<00:03:28.629> it<00:03:28.810> led<00:03:29.079> to

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.290 
ago we had so little that it led to

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.800
