00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.440
 hi everyone is so more finally with 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:06.690
 a new video tutorial today I will show 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:08.160
 how to disassemble a reconstruction like 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.340
 prepare nails for a new one 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.750
 reconstruction then to make a rapid 

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:15.870
 then here is taking one apart 

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:18.570
 acrylic reconstruction with a tip 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:19.130
 in carbon which I think is one of the 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.250
 best 

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:25.619
 then it is one of the best for three 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:28.890
 reasons why it does not heat at the stage of 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:31.050
 filings because it is able to eliminate 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:33.329
 any type of product quickly 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.070
 with great simplicity then acrylic 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:38.160
 which jella is also reusable 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:41.430
 after it was obviously disinfected 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.230
 and sterilized if you are interested in 

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.149
 buy toe you must 

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.430
 go and assess the distance they are 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:49.530
 between the oblique lines or lines that 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.180
 they go from left to right from the right 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.430
 to the left and which go to form the 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.730
 reticulated the more these lines will be 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.890
 near and more your fraser tip has 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.420
 so much more subtly so it will do 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:02.449
 a thinner powder when 

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:05.760
 place the tip on the reconstruction 

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:07.890
 you will feel less vibrations and therefore it is 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.600
 as if you are going to smooth it slowly 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:13.710
 and therefore remains very smooth long 

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:14.369
 instead if the oblique lines are a lot 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.229
 distant 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:18.750
 when you place the tip of the weighbridge 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:21.750
 there will be many on the reconstruction 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:26.970
 vibrations do not make dust but make gods 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:29.670
 shavings and long does not remain very much 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:32.400
 smooth ok another thing to say is di 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.950
 fundamental importance of lending 

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.270
 very careful when using this 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.460
 kind of accounts and here because they have the 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.140
 sharp cut tip and then when 

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.869
 maybe go for a cuticle tour 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.490
 then make unique dry cuts 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:45.060
 very deep that bring out a lot 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.520
 blood 

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:49.350
 you are very careful if you want to exist 

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.689
 also other types of tips like these b 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:55.259
 which have a rounded tip and therefore 

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:55.650
 don't meet certain types 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:58.350
 of 

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:00.270
 after that I wanted to tell you about the kit that you have 

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.330
 they give when you buy one 

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:06.060
 cutter then they will give you the sermig that 

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:08.880
 they are cylinders of abrasive paper 

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:11.130
 that you find in action and then in 

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:14.100
 low find the various bridges for the 

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:17.450
 preparation of the world and in particular 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:20.870
 right way you find the spindle 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:26.270
 then practically signing goes 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:30.120
 inserted into the mandino e 

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:32.580
 empty chuck together with the cylinder 

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:35.280
 abrasive and therefore eliminates the 

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:39.090
 jazz now critical then the only thing is 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:42.690
 these makes you are disposable 

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:45.720
 they warm up a lot and after that some 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:48.600
 sometimes it also happens that the mandino rotates 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:51.209
 but it does not rotate the cylinder is also from 

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:53.490
 to say that after 34 years I don't spot them 

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:57.690
 then where I advise against working on that 

00:02:53.490 --> 00:03:00.060
 these here are tips that I now l 

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:02.100
 use let's say to prepare the tour 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:05.250
 cuticles that I think are very good 

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:10.019
 then he decides to use the tip and it is more 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:11.790
 comfortable then after that I would like 

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:14.130
 advise you to use 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:17.580
 masks to protect against dust 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:19.980
 because even if we use all of them 

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:21.120
 Aspirators know that they aspire well 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:23.010
 little 

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:25.680
 obviously they also invented the 

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:27.390
 burs he had written from incorporated 

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.670
 but the prices are really too much 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:32.640
 high so I recommend you 

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:34.769
 use the templates work that you 

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:36.750
 I also recommend using 

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:38.640
 glasses to always protect you from 

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:41.010
 dust that when it goes into the eyes 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:43.560
 They make them redden you do not see more 

00:03:41.010 --> 00:03:46.080
 at least nothing happened to me then 

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:48.600
 health is of paramount importance not 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:51.360
 we must underestimate this 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:54.150
 point here we return to the main video 

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:57.209
 then I generally when I go to 

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:59.430
 eliminate the product on the nails giving birth 

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:01.500
 always from the little finger to the thumb to 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:04.500
 hand then switch to the other from the little finger 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:06.150
 up to the thumb then and when I go to 

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:08.000
 I always price from top to bottom 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:11.270
 down and from left 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.460
 towards the right this thing can vary 

00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:17.989
 from the fact if maybe you are left-handed 

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:19.820
 or if you rotate and the cylinder from 

00:04:17.989 --> 00:04:20.810
 left to right or from right 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:24.970
 to the left 

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:28.400
 but I do it this way then 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:30.200
 down the reconstruction and if I have to 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:33.170
 redo an acrylic reconstruction 

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:35.780
 I leave a small thin layer if I go 

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:38.150
 rebuild in normal gel or seeds 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:41.270
 I'm going to eliminate everything 

00:04:38.150 --> 00:04:42.740
 how am i doing this like that 

00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:44.840
 I told you earlier you have to stay 

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:47.650
 very careful with this time because it is 

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:50.180
 very sharp therefore cutting phase 

00:04:47.650 --> 00:04:52.730
 beautiful I propose then then exit 

00:04:50.180 --> 00:04:55.970
 a great deal of blood wings ardent that o 

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:57.710
 I use this bomb here to get ready 

00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:00.530
 the cuticle round and then below a 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:04.730
 this time more actuations push 

00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:07.910
 cuticles and eliminates it 

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:09.980
 layer of cuticles I am 

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:13.100
 hold on to the nail ok 

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:15.440
 after that I go to the beach for good 

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:20.210
 all the cuticle rounds and I go to 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:22.790
 to slightly dull the part that is 

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:25.400
 been touched by the socket to make one 

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:27.350
 reconstruction done well and in a short time 

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:32.419
 you have to try to make very few 

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:35.510
 movements in the sense that if taken ten e 

00:05:32.419 --> 00:05:38.419
 you have to nail them all 

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:40.610
 one from the little finger to the thumb and to the 

00:05:38.419 --> 00:05:43.190
 little finger to thumb if you prepare them 

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:45.320
 cuticles always from miur to thumb ed 

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:48.380
 on the little finger with thumbs so just like that 

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:51.410
 you will be able to save time 

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:52.669
 so this here to the secret does not follow 

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:56.419
 pass that I know 

00:05:52.669 --> 00:05:58.400
 with 5 seconds from lim to the other cutter 

00:05:56.419 --> 00:06:00.590
 farming and lose a lot of time 

00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:02.600
 then more or almost finished then or 

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:05.150
 dusted removed from net dust the 

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:08.450
 primer and after that I make a pass 

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:10.760
 of base gel three minutes in a lamp that 

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:13.190
 it is not ready to be rebuilt 

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:15.680
 after that this video will be here 

00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:20.270
 connected another video that is to 

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:23.450
 a Gothic almond rebuilt in gel 

00:06:20.270 --> 00:06:25.370
 I'll just put this video here 

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:26.540
 I'll put the voice to the other video already 

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:28.640
 ready 

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:32.000
 then guys I hope with this video there 

00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:34.520
 enjoyed a lot of information 

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:38.920
 I hope in short what he says and above all for 

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:42.830
 who maybe started just ok then 

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:45.260
 the video ends right here then if 

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:48.860
 you want you can look for me on facebook I am 

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:50.930
 incense or you can put on 

00:06:48.860 --> 00:06:53.810
 square my face the nail artist 

00:06:50.930 --> 00:06:54.350
 of youtube that comes to as much as 7 then 

00:06:53.810 --> 00:06:56.660
 boys 

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:59.020
 goodbye and good day everyone 

00:06:56.660 --> 00:06:59.020
 Hello
