00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.290
 tracking system such as release early years 

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:44.130
 now microbe coaching 

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:47.190
 who takes the program in focus 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:49.470
 young smuggling clay and he is sad apps 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:52.830
 from perfect in the grill 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:56.400
 the defective game you grill them in games 

00:00:52.830 --> 00:01:01.110
 best there can be many decided and simple 

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:03.090
 raise oldies starting for wash i am 

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:05.190
 here actually because I am incredibly 

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:07.440
 am curious about the method 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:10.440
 surprised by the structure that is in it 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:12.630
 trained by all models there 

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:14.820
 and the explanations that accompany it 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:18.090
 is much more structured than I experienced 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:21.510
 so also in many other sports 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.970
 on Thursday certainly went very positively 

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:26.430
 very nice very educational I win 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:29.370
 come to develop their own role as 

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:31.620
 trainer and yes i really like you after 

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:33.120
 Make this course really clear to yourself 

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:34.470
 are developing and I think so too 

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.940
 just make it very clear that it is good 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:38.970
 explained 

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:40.110
 the form you will be handed 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.970
 built up 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.680
 gosh argue more difficult but 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.510
 from easy to difficult to much more 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.700
 party for more filming competition oriented 

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:49.080
 and I paint that a lot 

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.850
 children learn language just to film hours 

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:52.860
 she also likes that much better than it 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.170
 Well offered whether you are the five 

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.580
 classes or first division that doesn't matter 

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:58.680
 not everyone can apply for 

00:01:56.580 --> 00:02:00.390
 every levels it is think it too 

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.790
 every child is fun and educational and that is why 

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:05.270
 I recommend it to everyone 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:08.179
 You can course your pleasant and CIA educational 

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:10.340
 experienced and especially on the field 

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:11.959
 practice focused with you I think one 

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.040
 very smooth season with good ones 

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:14.930
 exercises can be good 

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.450
 this is a completely different approach 

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:19.900
 and where the only animal comes first 

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.900
 per cent 

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:24.440
 I would say that this course is one 

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:26.720
 enrichment is for you for you for you 

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.519
 four career footballers and it you 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.230
 definitely must follow 

00:02:28.519 --> 00:02:32.090
 I must say it was a really them 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.049
 the gates of the lectures that 

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.849
 chock-full 

00:02:33.049 --> 00:02:36.799
 usable between the disassemble on it 

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:39.500
 field can also use the 

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:41.000
 practice sessions in the stadium that one 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.660
 I will immediately see myself a few of them tomorrow 

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.299
 to work 

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:46.280
 I myself come from the training of the 

00:02:44.299 --> 00:02:48.950
 Belgian Football Association 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:51.380
 where we mainly work in groups and 

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:52.220
 where the group actually go football 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.360
 determine 

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:56.000
 so that's a difference with 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:59.390
 individual and group applause color 

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.489
 This is a one course that plays for 

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:04.099
 everyone is suitable but you especially 

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:05.720
 back with a nose on the main one 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:07.340
 business football bustle that's love 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.720
 for the game 

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:11.180
 yes i now get people myself and for 

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:14.239
 the substructure mainly small things 

00:03:11.180 --> 00:03:16.819
 a lot about the individual's long term 

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:18.680
 small much in terms of speed and normal 

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:20.870
 in the middle of a team organization 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.549
 and your training organization 

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:24.530
 must always be the team-oriented is total on 

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:27.500
 the individual so that is one anyway 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:29.450
 must 'is to follow every trains 

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:31.700
 who wants to learn something and move on 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:33.620
 many makers of youth education have become so 

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:36.010
 Immediately recommend a heartbeat 

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:36.010
