we're<00:01:38.909> seeing<00:01:39.090> the<00:01:39.240> the<00:01:39.270> single<00:01:39.960> gateway<00:01:40.229> the

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
we're seeing the the single gateway the

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.140 
we're seeing the the single gateway the
thing<00:01:40.740> about<00:01:40.890> this<00:01:41.040> map<00:01:41.250> is<00:01:41.280> it<00:01:41.729> tends<00:01:41.939> to<00:01:42.000> be<00:01:42.090> a

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
thing about this map is it tends to be a

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:44.660 
thing about this map is it tends to be a
little<00:01:42.270> bit<00:01:42.420> risky<00:01:42.810> because<00:01:43.710> you<00:01:43.950> can<00:01:44.100> you<00:01:44.520> can

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
little bit risky because you can you can

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.550 
little bit risky because you can you can
take<00:01:44.880> up<00:01:45.060> more<00:01:45.420> efficiently<00:01:45.930> because<00:01:46.140> you<00:01:46.380> do

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
take up more efficiently because you do

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.319 
take up more efficiently because you do
have<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:46.740> two<00:01:46.979> gasp<00:01:47.189> at<00:01:47.430> the<00:01:47.520> same<00:01:47.700> time<00:01:47.880> you

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:48.329 
have the two gasp at the same time you

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:50.240 
have the two gasp at the same time you
don't<00:01:48.450> want<00:01:48.570> to<00:01:48.780> get<00:01:48.899> caught<00:01:49.170> an<00:01:49.380> attack<00:01:49.680> with

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.250 
don't want to get caught an attack with

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:53.120 
don't want to get caught an attack with
your<00:01:50.399> leaving<00:01:50.790> your<00:01:50.909> teammate<00:01:51.750> vulnerable<00:01:52.229> or

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
your leaving your teammate vulnerable or

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.760 
your leaving your teammate vulnerable or
things<00:01:53.579> like<00:01:53.640> that<00:01:54.259> anyway<00:01:55.259> to<00:01:55.290> gate<00:01:55.619> we're

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:55.770 
things like that anyway to gate we're

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:56.749 
things like that anyway to gate we're
seeing<00:01:55.979> on<00:01:56.100> that<00:01:56.219> on<00:01:56.310> the<00:01:56.430> six<00:01:56.670> o'clock

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:56.759 
seeing on that on the six o'clock

00:01:56.759 --> 00:01:59.090 
seeing on that on the six o'clock
position<00:01:57.270> from<00:01:57.420> go<00:01:57.659> me<00:01:57.810> on<00:01:58.469> the<00:01:58.560> opposite<00:01:59.009> end

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
position from go me on the opposite end

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.770 
position from go me on the opposite end
I<00:01:59.340> think<00:01:59.520> that's<00:01:59.670> yet<00:01:59.880> that's<00:02:00.180> go<00:02:00.329> me<00:02:00.509> move<00:02:00.659> on

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:00.780 
I think that's yet that's go me move on

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:02.209 
I think that's yet that's go me move on
the<00:02:00.899> opposite<00:02:01.229> end<00:02:01.320> looks<00:02:01.799> like<00:02:01.920> you<00:02:02.040> went<00:02:02.130> for

00:02:02.209 --> 00:02:02.219 
the opposite end looks like you went for

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:03.440 
the opposite end looks like you went for
our<00:02:02.340> nine<00:02:02.520> pool<00:02:02.729> he's<00:02:02.850> got<00:02:03.000> the<00:02:03.119> gas<00:02:03.240> going

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
our nine pool he's got the gas going

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:05.060 
our nine pool he's got the gas going
down<00:02:03.719> so<00:02:04.140> probably<00:02:04.649> going<00:02:04.799> to<00:02:04.860> do<00:02:04.950> the

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
down so probably going to do the

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:06.709 
down so probably going to do the
standard<00:02:05.369> circling<00:02:05.729> quick<00:02:06.210> certainly<00:02:06.540> build

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
standard circling quick certainly build

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.889 
standard circling quick certainly build
looked<00:02:07.409> on<00:02:07.500> the<00:02:07.619> opposite<00:02:07.979> end<00:02:08.069> same<00:02:08.459> thing

00:02:08.889 --> 00:02:08.899 
looked on the opposite end same thing

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:10.700 
looked on the opposite end same thing
from

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:10.710 
from

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
from one side rise and also looks like

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.210 
from one side rise and also looks like

down<00:04:22.530> the<00:04:22.950> opposite<00:04:23.340> end<00:04:23.460> so<00:04:23.610> just<00:04:23.850> going<00:04:23.940> to

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.030 
down the opposite end so just going to

00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:24.530 
down the opposite end so just going to
allow<00:04:24.150> the<00:04:24.210> three

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:24.540 
allow the three

00:04:24.540 --> 00:04:25.970 
allow the three
do<00:04:24.930> it<00:04:25.050> looks<00:04:25.170> like<00:04:25.290> a<00:04:25.320> creep<00:04:25.530> colony<00:04:25.800> going

00:04:25.970 --> 00:04:25.980 
do it looks like a creep colony going

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:27.950 
do it looks like a creep colony going
down<00:04:26.130> I<00:04:26.340> don't<00:04:26.790> try<00:04:26.910> to<00:04:26.940> ward<00:04:27.300> off<00:04:27.420> the<00:04:27.480> results

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:27.960 
down I don't try to ward off the results

00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.110 
down I don't try to ward off the results
in<00:04:28.050> the<00:04:28.110> meantime<00:04:28.580> but<00:04:29.580> again<00:04:29.790> that<00:04:29.940> looks

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:30.120 
in the meantime but again that looks

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:32.000 
in the meantime but again that looks
like<00:04:30.240> that<00:04:30.360> Overlord<00:04:30.630> pushing<00:04:30.960> out<00:04:31.050> now<00:04:31.230> but

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:32.010 
like that Overlord pushing out now but

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:34.340 
like that Overlord pushing out now but
that<00:04:32.130> layer<00:04:32.340> is<00:04:32.750> wow<00:04:33.750> I<00:04:33.780> don't<00:04:34.110> think<00:04:34.230> there's

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:34.350 
that layer is wow I don't think there's

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:36.620 
that layer is wow I don't think there's
going<00:04:34.440> to<00:04:34.530> be<00:04:34.590> any<00:04:34.650> contention<00:04:35.160> in<00:04:35.370> the<00:04:35.490> air<00:04:35.630> by

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:36.630 
going to be any contention in the air by

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:39.080 
going to be any contention in the air by
rise<00:04:36.900> mu<00:04:37.290> has<00:04:38.010> it<00:04:38.190> up<00:04:38.280> but<00:04:38.430> they're<00:04:38.580> just<00:04:39.000> going

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090 
rise mu has it up but they're just going

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:42.740 
rise mu has it up but they're just going
to<00:04:39.150> have<00:04:39.390> to<00:04:39.420> counseling<00:04:40.170> some<00:04:41.180> huh<00:04:42.180> canceling

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:42.750 
to have to counseling some huh canceling

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:43.880 
to have to counseling some huh canceling
some<00:04:42.870> larvae<00:04:43.140> there<00:04:43.260> interestingly<00:04:43.530> enough

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:43.890 
some larvae there interestingly enough

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:45.770 
some larvae there interestingly enough
two<00:04:44.070> of<00:04:44.160> them<00:04:44.280> in<00:04:44.910> particular<00:04:45.060> might<00:04:45.540> be<00:04:45.660> that

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:45.780 
two of them in particular might be that

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:47.450 
two of them in particular might be that
they're<00:04:45.930> just<00:04:46.080> dying<00:04:46.260> don<00:04:46.890> their<00:04:47.070> positioning

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:47.460 
they're just dying don their positioning

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:48.380 
they're just dying don their positioning
actually<00:04:47.820> that's<00:04:47.970> what<00:04:48.090> i<00:04:48.120> was<00:04:48.180> kind<00:04:48.360> of

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:48.390 
actually that's what i was kind of

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:50.150 
actually that's what i was kind of

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.520 
hesitant to say earlier is wondering
about<00:04:50.250> that<00:04:50.370> mu<00:04:50.990> coming<00:04:51.990> around<00:04:52.170> it<00:04:52.320> looks

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:52.530 
about that mu coming around it looks

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:53.720 
about that mu coming around it looks
like<00:04:52.620> he's<00:04:52.740> also<00:04:52.920> going<00:04:53.130> to<00:04:53.220> test<00:04:53.400> the<00:04:53.520> front

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:53.730 
like he's also going to test the front

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:55.820 
like he's also going to test the front
door<00:04:53.880> but<00:04:54.030> brain<00:04:54.510> honestly<00:04:55.110> this<00:04:55.260> is<00:04:55.380> another

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:07.680 
break out of the base so now we're going

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.500 
break out of the base so now we're going
to<00:05:07.740> see<00:05:07.890> and<00:05:08.640> now<00:05:08.790> at<00:05:08.970> ekta<00:05:09.150> layer<00:05:09.330> on<00:05:09.420> the

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:09.510 
to see and now at ekta layer on the

00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:11.060 
to see and now at ekta layer on the
opposite<00:05:09.900> end<00:05:09.990> from<00:05:10.110> Rhys<00:05:10.410> Rhys<00:05:10.620> has<00:05:10.830> a<00:05:10.860> lot

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:11.070 
opposite end from Rhys Rhys has a lot

00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:12.410 
opposite end from Rhys Rhys has a lot
and<00:05:11.340> he's<00:05:11.490> trying<00:05:11.640> to<00:05:11.790> push<00:05:11.940> out<00:05:12.060> of<00:05:12.150> his<00:05:12.240> base

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:12.420 
and he's trying to push out of his base

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:14.300 
and he's trying to push out of his base
but<00:05:13.230> it<00:05:13.290> looks<00:05:13.410> like<00:05:13.470> the<00:05:13.650> three<00:05:13.830> salts<00:05:14.100> along

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:14.310 
but it looks like the three salts along

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:16.160 
but it looks like the three salts along
with<00:05:14.520> just<00:05:14.880> that<00:05:15.000> not<00:05:15.570> even<00:05:15.600> I<00:05:15.960> would<00:05:16.080> say

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:16.170 
with just that not even I would say

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:18.050 
with just that not even I would say
maybe<00:05:16.200> a<00:05:16.440> full<00:05:16.650> control<00:05:17.010> group<00:05:17.250> the<00:05:17.670> opposite

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:18.060 
maybe a full control group the opposite

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:20.120 
maybe a full control group the opposite
end<00:05:18.180> but<00:05:18.540> two<00:05:18.660> full<00:05:18.930> control<00:05:19.200> groups<00:05:19.440> for<00:05:19.830> rise

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:20.130 
end but two full control groups for rise

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:21.620 
end but two full control groups for rise
in<00:05:20.280> the<00:05:20.340> meantime<00:05:20.460> he's<00:05:20.730> doing<00:05:21.270> a<00:05:21.300> good<00:05:21.420> job<00:05:21.480> of

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:21.630 
in the meantime he's doing a good job of

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:23.210 
in the meantime he's doing a good job of
containing<00:05:21.990> but<00:05:22.530> again<00:05:22.620> I<00:05:22.770> got<00:05:22.980> to<00:05:23.070> worry

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:23.220 
containing but again I got to worry

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:24.350 
containing but again I got to worry
about<00:05:23.280> these<00:05:23.490> new<00:05:23.550> lists<00:05:24.000> I'm<00:05:24.120> going<00:05:24.240> to<00:05:24.300> be

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:24.360 
about these new lists I'm going to be

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:26.960 
about these new lists I'm going to be
coming<00:05:24.510> out<00:05:24.750> and<00:05:25.590> the<00:05:25.860> meantime<00:05:26.010> from<00:05:26.370> from

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:26.970 
coming out and the meantime from from

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:28.550 
coming out and the meantime from from
from<00:05:27.510> mu<00:05:27.750> I<00:05:27.780> think<00:05:28.080> that's<00:05:28.200> going<00:05:28.320> to<00:05:28.380> be<00:05:28.470> the

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:28.560 
from mu I think that's going to be the

00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:29.720 
from mu I think that's going to be the
deciding<00:05:28.830> factor<00:05:28.890> in<00:05:29.190> the<00:05:29.280> game<00:05:29.400> is<00:05:29.550> whether

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:29.730 
deciding factor in the game is whether

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:31.640 
deciding factor in the game is whether
mu<00:05:30.300> gets<00:05:30.570> attacked<00:05:30.870> right<00:05:31.110> now<00:05:31.260> whether<00:05:31.410> he

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:31.650 
mu gets attacked right now whether he

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:33.830 
mu gets attacked right now whether he
loses<00:05:31.980> his<00:05:32.100> base<00:05:32.280> or<00:05:33.120> go<00:05:33.300> me<00:05:33.450> maybe<00:05:33.630> gets

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:33.840 
loses his base or go me maybe gets

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:35.210 
loses his base or go me maybe gets
overrun<00:05:34.230> while<00:05:34.410> this<00:05:34.530> tech<00:05:34.770> is<00:05:34.800> happening

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:35.220 
overrun while this tech is happening

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:36.140 
overrun while this tech is happening
like<00:05:35.340> I<00:05:35.400> was<00:05:35.520> saying<00:05:35.640> at<00:05:35.730> the<00:05:35.790> beginning<00:05:35.880> of

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:36.150 
like I was saying at the beginning of

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:38.120 
like I was saying at the beginning of
the<00:05:36.240> game<00:05:36.360> and<00:05:37.110> now<00:05:37.350> it<00:05:37.560> looks<00:05:37.590> like<00:05:37.800> we<00:05:37.980> might

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:38.130 
the game and now it looks like we might

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:39.290 
the game and now it looks like we might
see<00:05:38.310> that<00:05:38.430> bear<00:05:38.640> down<00:05:38.790> because<00:05:39.000> we're<00:05:39.150> seeing
