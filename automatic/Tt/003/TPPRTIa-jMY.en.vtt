 The places and that already caught in Brazil 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:27.150

 and the key is already there 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.910
 for a long time this trend is not new and 

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:44.579
 Tell me a little bit how it came about. 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:47.010
 face chess patterned reminds 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:48.899
 england buzzkill strange presence 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.180
 marcus and alessandro an 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.690
 It is not your clinic that owns the bank. 

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:56.460
 The cool thing is that chess is totally 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:58.559
 renovated remodeled mixed with the 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.840
 animal frank list that also counts on 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.190
 new chance so girls now it's time 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.930
 to use chess 

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.570
 so it's time to see the subject right? 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:09.150
 only now 

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:10.620
 it's good and that's a trend I 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.720
 I have difficulties I do not want 

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:15.150
 to use chess as a cowboy 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.280
 I always bring and it was more classic the 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:18.360
 What do you think about the look today? 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:20.250
 you need not fear because 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.040
 chess can let you be calm and 

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:25.080
 Propane today to mount this 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.180
 game we have improved two trends 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.850
 the alex superclassic pattern 

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:33.150
 animaking effective in error who beats the 

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:35.490
 eye knows with the rates of a black guru 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.440
 that gives a super touch how much pro agent 

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.450
 he mixed all this with a period 

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:42.020
 which also matches with yellow 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:42.020
 of the machine 

00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.370
 to put on the look of the head we did 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:52.840
 a real fruit salad and 

00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:55.330
 showed three trends that I 

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.670
 I particularly adore raylon 

00:01:55.330 --> 00:02:00.310
 frisso skirt with dirty shirt and 

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:02.650
 discreet super well the second trend to 

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.280
 mix of super plaid pattern in 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:05.560
 high 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.360
 modern shave and a tendency that I 

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.040
 i love camilla shirt mix 

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:09.550
 masculine in the feminine look that you 

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:12.610
 found 

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:15.250
 I can say it goes without saying that everything 

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:17.440
 It's very powerful, I fell in love 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:19.780
 the mixture of prints and textures because 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.800
 This is the kind of group you know that 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.270
 is in doubt 

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.310
 halfway to excellence I know 

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:27.250
 there I go you go to the end 

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.870
 someone wears shiny shoe earring 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:32.620
 big and gone 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:34.720
 super co amen good right now we 

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.520
 come back and camila with the same shirt 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.560
 that we use the new nook but with 

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:40.780
 completely different looks than I 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.880
 I would not do it a different thing for me. 

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:44.860
 like you and me who rode the two 

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:46.300
 I want to source you, we'll start this way. 

00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:48.640
 What inspired you? 

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:50.950
 In fact, I think the great advantage of 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:53.200
 chess tried to play and make these 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:55.030
 crazy things you sometimes think you think of 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.400
 shine and make you shine 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:03:00.430
 classic ivory pattern blending 

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:03.040
 with the colors of atlantic that appeal to 

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:04.930
 the same brilliance of a sweater that interlocks the 

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.480
 my curiosity and this year is the 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:12.390
 that along with the shoe is a 

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.390
 super rock and you rodrigo 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.910
 I think I'm feeling completely 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:22.160
 rooke enrow ready to dance to go out to 

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:25.340
 night and looks super flash in this but not 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.750
 ask to mount the look of camila thinks 

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.730
 those women who are at home who 

00:03:26.750 --> 00:03:30.590
 love to know a different way to use 

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:33.410
 clothes that are sometimes accustomed to 

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:34.970
 otherwise use and mixed parts and 

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:36.740
 they go up basic 

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:43.990
 if you do not have the wardrobe you have to 

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:43.990
 have music pantaneira miniskirt jeans 

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:50.340
 the Atlantean leather belt that is more 

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:51.989
 fast because it transforms what 

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:53.819
 turns the message is the same 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:56.430
 boyfriend shirt before we called 

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:59.629
 now all attention to a maxi necklace 

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:59.629
 golden for stealing 

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:09.530
 then your doubts will be left vain and 

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:11.689
 questions on facebook and did not want to 

00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:14.540
 help us answer there and the first 

00:04:11.689 --> 00:04:19.099
 asks camila marques pointed as 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:20.870
 chess without seeming camilla because only 

00:04:19.099 --> 00:04:22.280
 one of the possibilities that we have 

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:24.169
 to use keys in today's program 

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:26.479
 several others you can be up to 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:28.580
 using chess can be 

00:04:26.479 --> 00:04:30.440
 classic may be one more tip that 

00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:32.150
 I give you not take that risk is 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:36.039
 never combine jeans with too much 

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:36.039
 fair and very wide buckle 

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:41.330
 the second question was gabriella costa 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:43.460
 I can use one month of prints with a 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:45.259
 chess skirt and a military top 

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.970
 discreet 

00:04:45.259 --> 00:04:48.650
 I think brave I think it paid 

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:50.630
 Shame we'll try but I suggest you 

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:52.880
 uses patterns with similar colors 

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:55.370
 or black and white and black and white or 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:56.810
 blue and black it to be anonymous but 

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:59.870
 I think it's worth trying with this 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:02.030
 Surely this was another territory
