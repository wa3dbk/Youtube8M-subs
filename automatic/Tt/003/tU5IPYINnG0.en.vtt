00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:32.450 
riddled it and it's apparently meant to
be<00:01:30.930> released<00:01:31.259> in<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.470> next<00:01:31.560> few<00:01:31.920> weeks<00:01:32.189> or<00:01:32.430> a

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460 
be released in the next few weeks or a

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.219 
be released in the next few weeks or a
couple<00:01:32.490> weeks<00:01:32.909> and<00:01:33.210> it<00:01:33.659> should<00:01:33.869> be<00:01:33.960> really

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
couple weeks and it should be really

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.569 
couple weeks and it should be really
because<00:01:34.409> the<00:01:34.500> seasons<00:01:34.860> about<00:01:34.950> start<00:01:35.430> and

00:01:35.569 --> 00:01:35.579 
because the seasons about start and

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:37.700 
because the seasons about start and
preseason<00:01:35.970> with<00:01:36.689> all<00:01:36.869> the<00:01:36.990> games<00:01:37.229> and<00:01:37.470> stuff

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:37.710 
preseason with all the games and stuff

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.080 
preseason with all the games and stuff
they'll<00:01:37.950> have<00:01:38.130> to<00:01:38.159> use<00:01:38.430> that<00:01:38.610> key<00:01:38.790> at<00:01:38.850> some

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
they'll have to use that key at some

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.969 
they'll have to use that key at some
point<00:01:39.329> but<00:01:39.750> it's<00:01:39.869> very<00:01:40.110> different<00:01:40.470> for<00:01:40.920> a

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:40.979 
point but it's very different for a

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:42.469 
point but it's very different for a
ramjet<00:01:41.280> kicks<00:01:41.729> I<00:01:41.850> don't<00:01:42.030> really<00:01:42.210> have<00:01:42.329> that

00:01:42.469 --> 00:01:42.479 
ramjet kicks I don't really have that

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:45.560 
ramjet kicks I don't really have that
sweat<00:01:43.320> pant<00:01:43.649> shirt<00:01:44.340> look<00:01:44.729> to<00:01:44.909> their<00:01:45.060> way<00:01:45.240> shirt

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570 
sweat pant shirt look to their way shirt

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.630 
sweat pant shirt look to their way shirt
and<00:01:45.869> it<00:01:46.170> does<00:01:46.350> look<00:01:46.590> like<00:01:46.619> that<00:01:46.979> to<00:01:47.220> me<00:01:47.340> my

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:47.640 
and it does look like that to me my

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.490 
and it does look like that to me my
opinion<00:01:48.000> it<00:01:48.090> looks<00:01:48.329> like<00:01:48.509> you<00:01:48.750> wear<00:01:48.960> one<00:01:49.470> of

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500 
opinion it looks like you wear one of

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.090 
opinion it looks like you wear one of
them<00:01:49.649> like<00:01:49.890> sweatpants<00:01:50.460> or<00:01:51.380> sweaty<00:01:52.380> or

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:53.100 
them like sweatpants or sweaty or

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.069 
them like sweatpants or sweaty or
whatnot<00:01:53.280> that<00:01:53.490> sort<00:01:53.880> of<00:01:53.909> fabric<00:01:54.869> material

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:55.079 
whatnot that sort of fabric material

00:01:55.079 --> 00:01:57.410 
whatnot that sort of fabric material
it's<00:01:55.860> a<00:01:55.890> different<00:01:56.070> kit<00:01:56.520> Ramsey<00:01:56.939> I<00:01:56.969> do<00:01:57.119> like<00:01:57.390> a

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
it's a different kit Ramsey I do like a

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.060 
it's a different kit Ramsey I do like a
lot<00:01:57.689> so<00:01:58.020> if<00:01:58.200> they<00:01:58.320> do<00:01:58.380> have<00:01:58.619> that<00:01:58.740> it's<00:01:58.920> very

00:01:59.060 --> 00:01:59.070 
lot so if they do have that it's very

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:01.209 
lot so if they do have that it's very
nice<00:01:59.310> kid<00:01:59.579> the<00:01:59.969> next<00:02:00.210> thing<00:02:00.329> we<00:02:00.540> do<00:02:00.719> have<00:02:00.960> is

00:02:01.209 --> 00:02:01.219 
nice kid the next thing we do have is

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:03.830 
nice kid the next thing we do have is
athletico<00:02:02.219> madrid<00:02:02.729> and<00:02:02.969> they've<00:02:03.540> also

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:03.840 
athletico madrid and they've also

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.020 
athletico madrid and they've also
released<00:02:04.079> their<00:02:04.590> actual<00:02:04.920> home<00:02:05.130> kit<00:02:05.460> and<00:02:05.790> is

released their actual home kit and is

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.700 
released their actual home kit and is
very<00:02:06.149> different<00:02:06.509> because<00:02:06.750> they<00:02:07.079> usually<00:02:07.290> have

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710 
very different because they usually have

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.469 
very different because they usually have
just<00:02:07.979> collars<00:02:08.399> on<00:02:08.550> their<00:02:08.670> shirt<00:02:08.910> but<00:02:09.360> this

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
just collars on their shirt but this

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:10.880 
just collars on their shirt but this
