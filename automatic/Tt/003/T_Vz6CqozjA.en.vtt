00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.240 
we're not blah blah blah and then I

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.179 
we're not blah blah blah and then I
started<00:00:24.660> seeing<00:00:24.869> videos<00:00:25.289> about<00:00:25.650> profile

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:26.189 
started seeing videos about profile

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.950 
started seeing videos about profile
cosmetics<00:00:26.880> and<00:00:27.210> profusion<00:00:28.050> cosmetics<00:00:29.779> if<00:00:30.779> you

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:30.960 
cosmetics and profusion cosmetics if you

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.440 
cosmetics and profusion cosmetics if you
see<00:00:31.260> here<00:00:31.740> there<00:00:32.070> is<00:00:32.250> a<00:00:32.279> little<00:00:32.640> label<00:00:33.090> that

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
see here there is a little label that

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.410 
see here there is a little label that
says<00:00:33.780> profusion<00:00:34.670> underneath<00:00:35.670> it<00:00:35.940> says

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:36.420 
says profusion underneath it says

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.450 
says profusion underneath it says
profound<00:00:37.020> and<00:00:37.200> I<00:00:37.260> think<00:00:37.500> they<00:00:37.800> did<00:00:38.430> a

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
profound and I think they did a

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.010 
profound and I think they did a
conversion<00:00:38.879> or<00:00:39.059> switch<00:00:39.329> over<00:00:39.600> something<00:00:39.930> on

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
conversion or switch over something on

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.110 
conversion or switch over something on
them<00:00:40.230> anyway<00:00:41.160> if<00:00:41.399> you<00:00:41.579> look<00:00:41.730> at<00:00:41.790> the<00:00:41.850> colors

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:42.120 
them anyway if you look at the colors

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.299 
them anyway if you look at the colors
the<00:00:42.270> very<00:00:42.480> vibrant<00:00:43.910> they're<00:00:44.910> very<00:00:45.059> pigmented

00:00:46.299 --> 00:00:46.309 
the very vibrant they're very pigmented

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:49.130 
the very vibrant they're very pigmented
for<00:00:47.309> example<00:00:47.820> I'm<00:00:48.090> not<00:00:48.239> even<00:00:48.510> pressing<00:00:48.750> down

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
for example I'm not even pressing down

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:55.250 
for example I'm not even pressing down
and<00:00:50.100> let's<00:00:50.879> see<00:00:51.059> can<00:00:51.239> see<00:00:51.539> that<00:00:53.899> ain't<00:00:54.899> kind<00:00:55.140> of

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:55.260 
and let's see can see that ain't kind of

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.220 
and let's see can see that ain't kind of
see<00:00:55.379> the<00:00:55.500> color<00:00:55.710> there<00:00:56.809> maybe<00:00:57.809> that<00:00:58.050> was<00:00:58.140> a<00:00:58.199> bad

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230 
see the color there maybe that was a bad

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:01.660 
see the color there maybe that was a bad
example<00:00:58.410> but<00:00:59.039> anyway<00:00:59.370> okay<00:01:00.359> so<00:01:00.449> researching<00:01:01.320> I

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:01.670 
example but anyway okay so researching I

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:05.570 
example but anyway okay so researching I

see that there and that's what it looks

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.660 
see that there and that's what it looks
like<00:02:15.390> there's<00:02:16.230> a<00:02:16.380> lot<00:02:16.680> of<00:02:16.710> profusion<00:02:17.190> pallets

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
like there's a lot of profusion pallets

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.300 
like there's a lot of profusion pallets
out<00:02:17.850> now<00:02:18.090> that<00:02:18.840> are<00:02:19.080> not<00:02:19.320> the<00:02:19.590> round<00:02:19.830> bubbles

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:20.310

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:23.490 
and I don't like their colors that much

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:26.450
