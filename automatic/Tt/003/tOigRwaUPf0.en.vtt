00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.830
 everyone better to get you a mayor and 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:20.680
 today we'll talk about the tank crew 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:21.430
 and what better perks to download first 

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.960
 turn 

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:27.310
 so let's start first in our list 

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.550
 accordingly in the crew it 

00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:32.859
 his driver is represented by 4 1 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:35.230
 then vigilance field repair survivability 

00:00:32.859 --> 00:00:38.410
 driving what is his most important 

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:40.360
 personally in my opinion is driving you 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:43.000
 probably many times faced with 

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:45.340
 what is your tank starting slowly 

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.020
 turns that in the upper left 

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:49.719
 where to show the transfer 

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:51.910
 they jump first to the third one 

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:54.700
 then the second kind of starts to turn 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:57.579
 This is what driving skill affects. 

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:59.920
 your driver will be right on time 

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:02.680
 switch these same gear 

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.299
 still this skill affects braking but 

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.490
 if we let you fly big 

00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:08.409
 the speed you want to stop in time and 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:10.270
 don't fly around the corner don't get 

00:01:08.409 --> 00:01:13.179
 a few shells but your mechanical drive is not 

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:15.670
 pumped and can drown and you take off 

00:01:13.179 --> 00:01:18.490
 accordingly, get it better 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:20.799
 pump the next skill by priority 

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.639
 personally in my opinion again this 

00:01:20.799 --> 00:01:23.619
 vitality 

00:01:21.639 --> 00:01:26.020
 that is, does it affect whether your 

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:27.969
 crew member dodge shells 

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:30.279
 inside the tank like him 

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:32.349
 or will breathe on each fragment as well 

00:01:30.279 --> 00:01:34.509
 considering that if you 

00:01:32.349 --> 00:01:36.999
 knock out some crew members in 

00:01:34.509 --> 00:01:39.279
 in this case mechvod then let's say tank 

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:40.869
 stops for 10 seconds which is pretty 

00:01:39.279 --> 00:01:42.939
 after all it is very important after all for these 10 seconds 

00:01:40.869 --> 00:01:45.189
 will help to cram well from everything 

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:47.109
 in the open area so swing 

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:49.419
 it is necessary with the next perk too 

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:51.819
 I understand this field repair is he 

00:01:49.419 --> 00:01:54.399
 respectively, you have more pumped so 

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:56.229
 faster you go field repair well then 

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:58.659
 there is a repair as they say in the field 

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:00.909
 last fourth perk is vigilance 

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:02.889
 here I donâ€™t really understand everything with him 

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:04.029
 as a tank, we can see even if it is 

00:02:02.889 --> 00:02:06.969
 stands in the bushes and 

00:02:04.029 --> 00:02:09.520
 from the bushes sticks out that here we see this 

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:11.500
 sticking part in the other side I think 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:13.569
 that it affects the appearance of enemies on 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.550
 minimap ie if mehvod noticed 

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:16.740
 someone's enemy 

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:19.020
 ahead then this enemy is corresponding 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:21.390
 marked on the very minimap 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:23.550
 and so with mechvod understand 1 better 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.350
 swing driving sweat vitality sweat 

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:27.480
 field repair well, and vigilance can 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:29.400
 leave for later or if you get points 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.470
 research nowhere to go well you can 

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:34.020
 little pump comes next 

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:36.570
 gunner here is not so simple as with 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:39.240
 a driver mechanic if you like the mode 

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:41.220
 realistic and simulator battles then 

00:02:39.240 --> 00:02:43.380
 I recommend you to download first 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:45.960
 to lead that is the skill which 

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:48.300
 responsible for quickly pointing the gun at 

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:50.760
 opponent and if you're an amateur 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:53.310
 arcade mode then I advise you to download 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.850
 the first determination of the range since in 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.040
 arcade 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:58.980
 we will write down the distance to the enemy and 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:01.020
 there she is racing is important unlike rds bl 

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.150
 where respectively the player 

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:05.280
 determines the distance to and do not forget 

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.320
 what range determination is 

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:09.930
 priority in Arcadia it does not reduce 

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:11.640
 merit perk hovering so I generally 

00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.770
 I advise you to download them in parallel 

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:15.000
 then you have 3 perks left the same as 

00:03:13.770 --> 00:03:17.190
 at the driver 

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.800
 it is survivability then field repair and 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:22.020
 vigilance is the same as his first 

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:24.090
 swing durability so you do not knock out 

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:26.130
 each time the gunner and you did not stand in 

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:28.350
 powerlessness 10 seconds and could not shoot 

00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:30.510
 then field repair, respectively 

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:32.160
 so you quickly repaired well and vigilance 

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.560
 already at your request 

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:36.570
 by the way about perk field repair 

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:39.270
 then I did not really understand how it works 

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:41.370
 Does he answer each crew member 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:43.410
 for answering it more precisely 

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:45.150
 if you got damage to the gunner drives 

00:03:43.410 --> 00:03:48.090
 horizontal or vertical guidance 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:50.610
 whether he is in charge of repairing them or he 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:52.950
 is responsible for the repair of the tank but all in all 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:55.290
 Anyway , I recommend downloading it. 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:58.410
 all crew members parallel that is 

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:01.500
 Immediately the third crew member in our list 

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:03.840
 This is the tank commander, he also has 5 perks 

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.970
 as the gunner also repetitive 

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:08.280
 how vigilance watering repair survivability a 

00:04:05.970 --> 00:04:10.890
 also have leadership and shooting out 

00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:12.630
 machine guns so what better to swing and here at 

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:14.370
 I had a dilemma like this 

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:16.980
 leadership description is written that he 

00:04:14.370 --> 00:04:18.959
 improving from skills to all crew members with 

00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:21.030
 I did not notice the other side having pumped it 

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:24.000
 improving the skills of each crew member 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:25.690
 in the menu of the crews itself , although it may be 

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.240
 it's just not displaying 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:30.220
 In any case, the tank commander seems to be 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:32.560
 not a particularly important crew member is like him 

00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:35.110
 not for loading not for guidance not for 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:36.850
 driving is kind of like not responding therefore 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:38.650
 I probably would have him first 

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:40.660
 started swinging vitality later 

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:42.490
 respectively, field repair then 

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:44.590
 leadership well or field repair and 

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:46.660
 leadership in parallel and lastly 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:48.490
 We remain vigilant and shooting out 

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:50.470
 paired with a machine gun 

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:53.230
 although by the way iq shooting from paired 

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:55.780
 machine gun had to add more skill 

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:57.850
 loading this very machine gun but with 

00:04:55.780 --> 00:05:00.250
 vigilance with us and so clear I am up 

00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:02.530
 this did not tell about with shooting out 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:04.720
 machine gun is a little more complicated here first 

00:05:02.530 --> 00:05:06.970
 they have not yet entered the game and yet 

00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:09.190
 machine gun as sought paired with a gun 

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:10.870
 the edge does not all rise up if 

00:05:09.190 --> 00:05:13.180
 you let you decide to shoot by 

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:15.490
 airplanes and in a battle against tanks not 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:17.560
 it seems he is not really needed and so with 

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:20.260
 tank commander finished the following 

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:23.050
 very important crew member is charging 

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:25.300
 he has 4 perks and the most important 

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:26.950
 This is loading the guns accordingly 

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:29.170
 more brain pumped the faster 

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:31.540
 loader shove projectile into the gun 

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:33.490
 but the rest are standard perks first 

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:35.680
 survivability then field repair well 

00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:38.500
 then if the glasses have nowhere to go then 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:41.500
 vigilance and we come to the last member 

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:44.200
 the crew is a gunner perk with him 

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:46.390
 as much for six by the way you'll see that 

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:49.030
 she has a reload of course machine gun 

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:51.180
 I talked about this when reviewing the commander 

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:53.800
 there too i think on add such 

00:05:51.180 --> 00:05:56.590
 recharge so what is better for him to swing 

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:58.930
 I would probably start with radio afterwards 

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:01.510
 would have pumped vitality then fell heartbroken and 

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:03.910
 in the end he would leave vigilance perks on 

00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:06.370
 machine gun there is already a choice that you 

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:08.980
 like but then all the crew member i 

00:06:06.370 --> 00:06:11.430
 told and that he had better swing but 

00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:13.750
 there remains one more important thing such as 

00:06:11.430 --> 00:06:16.120
 qualification you might notice when 

00:06:13.750 --> 00:06:18.880
 told about each crew member and a 

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:21.400
 Perka on the right where here is tsiferkami 

00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:24.070
 degree pumped sti written another plus 

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:27.010
 30 is of course not every perk but 

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:29.020
 most of these are qualifications like 

00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:31.360
 you know on every crew you can 

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:34.300
 put each tank more accurately train 

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:36.430
 crew on this tank but when you train 

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:38.320
 you just give the opportunity to ride 

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:40.900
 this tank and the crew 

00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:43.420
 so that the crew has mastered it better you can 

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:46.060
 qualify however raise 

00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:48.340
 qualification is not immediately possible on the same 

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:50.920
 first rank you need to level the crews 

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:53.980
 was over a hundred then you can buy 

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:55.960
 qualifications and the more rank the tank 

00:06:53.980 --> 00:06:58.720
 accordingly the crew level for 

00:06:55.960 --> 00:07:01.090
 purchases of this qualification should 

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:03.460
 be bigger but it's not all after 

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:07.060
 Purchases qualifications expert can 

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:09.970
 buy qualification as so 

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:11.770
 plus 30 added another 20 plus 

00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:14.980
 respectively, in total, you have 

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:17.140
 will be plus 50 however crew level 

00:07:14.980 --> 00:07:20.080
 need a lot more for the same 

00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:22.870
 first rank you need 400 already 

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:25.270
 on this I think you can finish well then 

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:28.390
 with you was the mayor I hope the video turned out 

00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:29.830
 for you informative put huskies 

00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:32.830
 subscribe to the channel 

00:07:29.830 --> 00:07:37.050
 Share this video with your friends and how 

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:37.050
 usually see you in sight 

00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:41.660
 and 

00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:49.919
 of course
