 adore things first how much of the summer and 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:18.840

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.590
 make it for fall and you can have one 

00:00:23.519 --> 00:00:27.420
 expect lots of great videos 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.550
 together with mylene today we are going something 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:32.489
 do what all the box requested namely 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.710
 a cooking video well I am personally 

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:36.510
 not really a kitchen princess 

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:39.149
 but luckily mylene bal is a bit more 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.730
 an experienced expert in the field of 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.829
 bins and such so what often go 

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.870
 today 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:48.000
 apple pie on the other hand I mine 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.379
 personal favorites and therefore this is 

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.629
 like to share with you today 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.239
 and a nice side effect is that we 

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:57.030
 an apple tree in the garden exist 

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.930
 so to get him no apples in shock 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:02.930
 but I'm going to pick the cabbage 

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:02.930
 text message 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:24.280
 to 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:32.320
 then we go over the ingredients 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:34.870
 the dough requires 520 grams of flour 

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.310
 teaspoon of salt and 22 grams of butter 

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:39.310
 for the filling have different country and 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:40.510
 kilos of apples needed around 50 grams of butter 3 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.730
 teaspoons cinnamon 

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:45.400
 marry the gram of fine granulated sugar 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:47.560
 fly shape of 23 centimeters in diameter 

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.360
 and a you with a little milk according to 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.460
 so you're all the kitchen crew 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:54.040
 as it is fixed and or can 

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.360
 not to be missed 

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.190
 etc. 

00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:58.990
 and now not entirely ready for bed this 

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:01.450
 facts to start we are going to start with 

00:01:58.990 --> 00:02:03.910
 the dough put the flour with the salt and 

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:05.770
 put the butter together in a bowl and mix it 

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:07.869
 with a mixer until it is their sandy 

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.970
 has consistency for mixing 

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:12.520
 I recommend using a dough knife for the dough 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:14.080
 use that with the regular mixer 

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:17.070
 all stick together and then it becomes 

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.070
 very difficult to work with 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:30.219
 now that the dough looks a bit like sand 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.849
 we go little bits of cold water 

00:02:30.219 --> 00:02:32.680
 add 

00:02:30.849 --> 00:02:35.349
 you have to add just as much water 

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.730
 so you wonder this does not work anymore 

00:02:35.349 --> 00:02:39.930
 falling apart 

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.930
 but the beauty sticks together 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:48.210
 now the dough into two balls and divided 

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:50.910
 you put toppix in cling film 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:52.500
 in the fridge and then golden fermé 

00:02:50.910 --> 00:02:54.360
 now 9 your fridge is ready we go in the 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.250
 meanwhile the on disputes now we go 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.950
 the sliced ​​apples 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.520
 and what we do is the butter in the pan 

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.160
 throw 

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:07.230
 both large enough to be nice 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:09.150
 some apples and the cinnamon scent also with you 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.910
 hear that butter through so it would 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:13.920
 the butter melts and then melts faster 

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:16.490
 you can get them there at the good we now the 

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:16.490
 apples in it 

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:25.130
 floors that through until all apples are one 

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:25.130
 little covered in the butter 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:31.820
 how 

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:33.350
 as you can see, all apples are now covered 

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:34.460
 with a layer of butter 

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:36.710
 then we add the sugar 

00:03:34.460 --> 00:03:38.090
 It is important that you throw 

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:39.050
 take into account the sweetness of you 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.580
 apples 

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:41.810
 because we were out of the garden 

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:44.060
 they don't mind very much they will have something 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:45.800
 more sugar done but bunch of apples 

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:46.940
 to success of itself then I would 

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:50.920
 might have to do something more 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:50.920
 but of course depends on taste 

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:57.080
 I now also go through the apples a bit 

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:58.970
 until they are soft but we do not cook the 

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:00.440
 apples for about 5 minutes with the 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:02.750
 leave lids on 

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:04.580
 so now they are not at all soft 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:06.200
 between 8 but good soft what we are going now 

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:08.360
 doing is throw the apples in a colander 

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:10.580
 so that some moisture can separate and 

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:13.420
 because of that, our crust won't leave him too 

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:13.420
 become soggy 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:22.750
 well the apple it cool in chess 

00:04:20.859 --> 00:04:24.729
 grease the baking tin we have the dough 

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:25.870
 rolled out and then in the form 

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:27.430
 laid out 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:29.229
 it and you actually have to 

00:04:27.430 --> 00:04:32.260
 doing is a bit against the sides 

00:04:29.229 --> 00:04:35.850
 and yes tony supreme actually 

00:04:32.260 --> 00:04:35.850
 now we are going to pie the apples 

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:45.060
 of the two balls of dough on the top 

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:46.590
 and I have a small one 

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:48.330
 part kept apart for the garnish 

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:52.530
 but that rack will soon show 

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:53.840
 first check out these other borders too 

00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:56.840
 roll 

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:56.840
 interart 

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:04.960
 now that it is closed over it I go the 

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:09.780
 edges off 

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:09.780
 she surpasses the surplus 

00:05:11.729 --> 00:05:15.449
 start is now complete but would not be complete 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:17.069
 complete like a nice decoration 

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:18.569
 because it is a restart have it before 

00:05:17.069 --> 00:05:20.249
 chosen to take pictures 

00:05:18.569 --> 00:05:22.650
 you can easily create this yourself 

00:05:20.249 --> 00:05:24.900
 by with a small knife from it 

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:27.360
 to cut leftover dough and cottage 

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:28.830
 and insert a leaf pattern into it 

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.210
 and then you can whole 

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:31.949
 easy with a mixture of yours 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:34.199
 stick milk on the cake 

00:05:31.949 --> 00:05:36.240
 And then you are ready when you are 30 to 40 

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:39.770
 minutes in the oven at 170 degrees 

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:39.770
 seated this is the result 

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:43.110
 my 

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:57.449
