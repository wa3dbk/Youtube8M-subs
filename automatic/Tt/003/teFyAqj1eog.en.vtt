you can actually hide the dock by using
a<00:00:37.140> four<00:00:37.380> finger<00:00:37.620> slide<00:00:38.430> down<00:00:38.730> or<00:00:38.940> slide<00:00:39.149> up

works it is extremely I guess I could
say<00:01:32.610> extremely<00:01:33.210> different<00:01:33.930> it's<00:01:34.049> just<00:01:34.110> a<00:01:34.350> very

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:34.920 
say extremely different it's just a very

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:36.920 
say extremely different it's just a very
large<00:01:35.189> departure<00:01:35.820> from<00:01:36.150> what<00:01:36.360> we<00:01:36.630> normally

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
large departure from what we normally

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.140

and that I don't know it kind of makes
it<00:01:44.070> a<00:01:44.189> little<00:01:44.250> difficult<00:01:44.880> to<00:01:44.909> get<00:01:45.090> used<00:01:45.329> to<00:01:45.420> and

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:45.689 
it a little difficult to get used to and

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:47.569 
it a little difficult to get used to and
it<00:01:45.780> takes<00:01:45.899> a<00:01:46.079> lot<00:01:46.439> of<00:01:46.470> work<00:01:46.890> a<00:01:47.189> lot<00:01:47.369> of

00:01:47.569 --> 00:01:47.579 
it takes a lot of work a lot of

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:49.609 
it takes a lot of work a lot of
experimentation<00:01:48.570> to<00:01:48.869> really<00:01:49.110> get<00:01:49.259> used<00:01:49.409> to<00:01:49.530> it

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:49.619 
experimentation to really get used to it

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:50.840 
experimentation to really get used to it
but<00:01:49.740> once<00:01:49.890> you<00:01:49.979> do<00:01:50.220> it's<00:01:50.520> pretty

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:50.850 
but once you do it's pretty

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:51.679 
but once you do it's pretty
self-explanatory

00:01:51.679 --> 00:01:51.689 
self-explanatory

00:01:51.689 --> 00:01:53.840 
self-explanatory
for<00:01:52.470> instance<00:01:52.770> you<00:01:52.860> saw<00:01:53.040> there<00:01:53.340> how<00:01:53.579> I<00:01:53.610> had<00:01:53.820> a

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
for instance you saw there how I had a

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.969 
for instance you saw there how I had a
maximized<00:01:54.540> view<00:01:54.960> and<00:01:55.140> if<00:01:55.200> I<00:01:55.290> swipe<00:01:55.590> down<00:01:55.829> with

00:01:55.969 --> 00:01:55.979 
maximized view and if I swipe down with

00:01:55.979 --> 00:01:58.069 
maximized view and if I swipe down with
four<00:01:56.159> fingers<00:01:56.369> I<00:01:56.850> could<00:01:57.329> have<00:01:57.810> that<00:01:57.960> little

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
four fingers I could have that little

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.899 
four fingers I could have that little
toolbar<00:01:58.619> at<00:01:58.740> the<00:01:58.799> top<00:01:58.890> that<00:01:59.219> allows<00:01:59.430> me<00:01:59.729> to

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
toolbar at the top that allows me to

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:02.510 
toolbar at the top that allows me to
minimize<00:02:00.420> or<00:02:00.780> to<00:02:01.170> view<00:02:01.380> multiple<00:02:01.530> apps<00:02:02.009> in<00:02:02.250> one

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:02.520 
minimize or to view multiple apps in one

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.429 
minimize or to view multiple apps in one
window<00:02:02.759> and<00:02:03.240> a<00:02:03.509> really<00:02:03.719> cool<00:02:04.020> thing<00:02:04.079> or

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:04.439 
window and a really cool thing or

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:05.780 
window and a really cool thing or
notable<00:02:04.860> thing<00:02:05.040> about<00:02:05.070> this<00:02:05.369> is<00:02:05.549> that<00:02:05.579> you

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
notable thing about this is that you

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.100 
notable thing about this is that you
could<00:02:05.909> interact<00:02:06.180> with<00:02:06.450> all<00:02:06.780> these

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
could interact with all these

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.469 
could interact with all these
applications<00:02:08.030> while<00:02:09.030> they're<00:02:09.300> in<00:02:09.390> this

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
applications while they're in this

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.150 
applications while they're in this
minimize<00:02:09.899> view<00:02:10.110> so<00:02:10.259> yes<00:02:10.530> you<00:02:10.709> can<00:02:10.890> actually

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:11.160 
minimize view so yes you can actually

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.640 
minimize view so yes you can actually
use<00:02:12.000> these<00:02:12.150> applications<00:02:12.360> to<00:02:12.930> application

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
use these applications to application

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:16.100 
use these applications to application
side<00:02:13.950> by<00:02:14.129> side<00:02:14.159> if<00:02:14.549> you<00:02:14.640> want<00:02:14.790> to<00:02:15.030> of<00:02:15.900> course

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:16.110 
side by side if you want to of course

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.630 
side by side if you want to of course
you<00:02:16.170> can<00:02:16.319> maximize<00:02:16.709> the<00:02:17.040> application<00:02:17.519> by

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
you can maximize the application by

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.149 
you can maximize the application by
tapping<00:02:17.849> the<00:02:18.030> maximize<00:02:18.510> button<00:02:18.540> there<00:02:19.159> and

00:02:20.149 --> 00:02:20.159 
tapping the maximize button there and

00:02:20.159 --> 00:02:22.280 
tapping the maximize button there and
you<00:02:20.790> can<00:02:20.939> get<00:02:21.090> back<00:02:21.269> to<00:02:21.420> the<00:02:21.510> home<00:02:21.659> screen<00:02:22.019> you

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:22.290 
you can get back to the home screen you

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:25.250 
you can get back to the home screen you
can<00:02:22.980> go<00:02:23.340> into<00:02:23.489> Mission<00:02:23.849> Control<00:02:24.120> mode<00:02:24.510> there's

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:25.260 
can go into Mission Control mode there's

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.830 
can go into Mission Control mode there's
just<00:02:25.439> so<00:02:25.650> much<00:02:25.860> you<00:02:25.920> can<00:02:26.069> do<00:02:26.430> here<00:02:26.459> with<00:02:27.420> OS

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
just so much you can do here with OS

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:30.050 
just so much you can do here with OS
experience<00:02:28.530> and<00:02:28.860> it<00:02:29.400> will<00:02:29.549> take<00:02:29.730> some

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
experience and it will take some

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.059 
experience and it will take some
definite<00:02:30.540> experimentation<00:02:31.500> on<00:02:31.590> your<00:02:31.769> part<00:02:32.010> to

00:02:32.059 --> 00:02:32.069 
definite experimentation on your part to

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:34.880 
definite experimentation on your part to
really<00:02:32.430> get<00:02:32.640> the<00:02:32.819> feel<00:02:33.659> of<00:02:33.900> how<00:02:34.409> this<00:02:34.620> tweak

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:34.890 
really get the feel of how this tweak

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.759 
really get the feel of how this tweak
works<00:02:35.430> it's<00:02:36.209> just<00:02:36.540> such<00:02:36.780> a<00:02:36.810> large<00:02:37.230> departure

00:02:37.759 --> 00:02:37.769 
works it's just such a large departure

00:02:37.769 --> 00:02:41.030 
works it's just such a large departure
as<00:02:37.890> I<00:02:37.980> told<00:02:38.220> you<00:02:38.400> from<00:02:38.579> stock<00:02:39.269> iOS<00:02:39.810> it's<00:02:40.769> more

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:41.040 
as I told you from stock iOS it's more

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.949 
as I told you from stock iOS it's more
of<00:02:41.129> a<00:02:41.220> desktop<00:02:41.640> experience<00:02:41.939> hence<00:02:42.629> the<00:02:42.810> name

00:02:42.949 --> 00:02:42.959 
of a desktop experience hence the name

00:02:42.959 --> 00:02:45.410 
of a desktop experience hence the name
OS<00:02:43.349> experience<00:02:43.980> you<00:02:44.430> get<00:02:44.579> a<00:02:44.640> real<00:02:44.879> desktop

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420 
OS experience you get a real desktop

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.319 
OS experience you get a real desktop
feel<00:02:45.750> on<00:02:46.170> your<00:02:46.590> iPad<00:02:47.010> using<00:02:47.879> this<00:02:48.030> jailbreak

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:48.329 
feel on your iPad using this jailbreak

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:51.199 
feel on your iPad using this jailbreak
tweak<00:02:49.400> let<00:02:50.400> me<00:02:50.489> show<00:02:50.639> you<00:02:50.700> some<00:02:50.909> of<00:02:50.940> the<00:02:51.090> other

00:02:51.199 --> 00:02:51.209 
tweak let me show you some of the other

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:53.599 
tweak let me show you some of the other
moving<00:02:51.900> parts<00:02:52.319> to<00:02:52.500> this<00:02:52.799> tweak<00:02:53.220> one<00:02:53.400> of<00:02:53.489> the

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:53.609 
moving parts to this tweak one of the

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:56.089 
moving parts to this tweak one of the
against<00:02:54.209> the<00:02:54.269> most<00:02:54.510> notable<00:02:54.870> features<00:02:55.379> of<00:02:55.620> OS

00:02:56.089 --> 00:02:56.099 
against the most notable features of OS

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:57.770 
against the most notable features of OS
experience<00:02:56.639> is<00:02:56.760> that<00:02:56.879> you<00:02:57.060> can<00:02:57.180> actually<00:02:57.359> move

00:02:57.770 --> 00:02:57.780 
experience is that you can actually move

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:01.520 
experience is that you can actually move
applications<00:02:59.030> to<00:03:00.030> different<00:03:00.480> desktops<00:03:00.959> right

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:01.530 
applications to different desktops right

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:04.099 
applications to different desktops right
there<00:03:01.769> on<00:03:01.889> the<00:03:01.980> fly<00:03:02.239> so<00:03:03.239> I'm<00:03:03.750> going<00:03:03.900> to<00:03:03.930> show

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:04.109 
there on the fly so I'm going to show

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:06.789 
there on the fly so I'm going to show
you<00:03:04.170> how<00:03:04.500> that<00:03:04.739> works<00:03:04.889> here<00:03:05.129> in<00:03:05.250> just<00:03:05.430> a<00:03:05.579> second

00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:06.799 
you how that works here in just a second

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:10.339 
you how that works here in just a second
first<00:03:07.799> of<00:03:07.920> all<00:03:08.010> minimize<00:03:08.519> our<00:03:09.389> clock<00:03:09.810> app<00:03:10.049> here

00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:10.349 
first of all minimize our clock app here

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:12.349 
first of all minimize our clock app here
so<00:03:11.280> you<00:03:11.370> could<00:03:11.489> see<00:03:11.609> I<00:03:11.639> have<00:03:11.700> the<00:03:11.939> clock<00:03:12.150> app

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:12.359 
so you could see I have the clock app

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:15.289 
so you could see I have the clock app
and<00:03:12.569> another<00:03:12.720> app<00:03:12.959> behind<00:03:13.349> it<00:03:13.700> and<00:03:14.700> I'm<00:03:15.180> gonna

00:03:15.289 --> 00:03:15.299 
and another app behind it and I'm gonna

00:03:15.299 --> 00:03:18.530 
and another app behind it and I'm gonna
go<00:03:15.510> back<00:03:15.780> into<00:03:16.019> the<00:03:16.590> Mission<00:03:16.889> Control<00:03:17.389> in<00:03:18.389> one

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
go back into the Mission Control in one

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.140 
go back into the Mission Control in one
second<00:03:19.049> you<00:03:19.290> can<00:03:19.799> also<00:03:19.949> rearrange<00:03:20.250> desktops

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:21.150 
second you can also rearrange desktops

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.210 
second you can also rearrange desktops
just<00:03:21.389> by<00:03:21.510> dragging<00:03:22.019> them<00:03:22.139> between<00:03:22.949> each<00:03:23.069> other

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:23.220 
just by dragging them between each other

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:25.759 
just by dragging them between each other
like<00:03:23.549> that<00:03:23.579> if<00:03:24.269> you<00:03:24.419> want<00:03:24.599> to<00:03:24.629> do<00:03:24.780> so<00:03:25.049> so<00:03:25.680> we're

00:03:25.759 --> 00:03:25.769 
like that if you want to do so so we're

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:27.979 
like that if you want to do so so we're
gonna<00:03:25.829> go<00:03:26.040> ahead<00:03:26.099> and<00:03:26.220> maximize<00:03:26.459> this<00:03:27.209> Safari

00:03:27.979 --> 00:03:27.989 
gonna go ahead and maximize this Safari

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:31.789 
gonna go ahead and maximize this Safari
browser<00:03:28.579> and<00:03:29.579> then<00:03:29.699> minimize<00:03:30.180> it<00:03:30.440> and<00:03:31.440> make<00:03:31.769> it

most<00:04:06.690> impressive<00:04:07.229> part<00:04:07.680> of<00:04:08.000> OS<00:04:09.000> experience

00:04:09.559 --> 00:04:09.569 
most impressive part of OS experience

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:11.420 
most impressive part of OS experience
just<00:04:09.780> being<00:04:10.109> able<00:04:10.229> to<00:04:10.349> move<00:04:10.620> applications

00:04:13.789 --> 00:04:13.799 
between desktops it's just kind of

00:04:13.799 --> 00:04:17.689 
between desktops it's just kind of
mind-boggling<00:04:14.930> as<00:04:15.930> far<00:04:16.409> as<00:04:16.500> how<00:04:16.739> useful<00:04:17.280> this

00:04:17.689 --> 00:04:17.699 
mind-boggling as far as how useful this

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:20.659 
mind-boggling as far as how useful this
tweak<00:04:17.970> is<00:04:18.180> though<00:04:18.449> I<00:04:18.690> don't<00:04:19.260> know<00:04:19.500> it<00:04:19.739> may<00:04:19.949> is

experience I love the tweak is a
excellent<00:05:07.290> technical<00:05:07.830> demonstration<00:05:08.340> it<00:05:09.120> is

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:09.270 
excellent technical demonstration it is

excellent technical demonstration it is
one<00:05:09.510> of<00:05:09.600> the<00:05:09.690> most<00:05:09.870> impressive<00:05:10.140> tweaks<00:05:10.590> I've

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:10.770 
one of the most impressive tweaks I've

00:05:10.770 --> 00:05:12.380 
one of the most impressive tweaks I've
ever<00:05:10.950> seen<00:05:11.250> from<00:05:11.460> a<00:05:11.610> technical<00:05:12.060> standpoint

00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:12.390 
ever seen from a technical standpoint

00:05:14.630 --> 00:05:14.640 
but the whole issue is whether or not
