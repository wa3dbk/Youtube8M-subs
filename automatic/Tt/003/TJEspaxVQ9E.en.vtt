00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:32.619 
in the package and then they look like

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:36.689 
in the package and then they look like
this<00:00:33.510> they<00:00:34.510> come<00:00:34.750> with<00:00:34.780> two<00:00:35.739> screws<00:00:36.010> right

00:00:36.689 --> 00:00:36.699

well<00:00:37.390> they<00:00:37.480> come<00:00:37.660> with<00:00:37.780> these<00:00:37.989> screws<00:00:38.380> here

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
well they come with these screws here

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.940 
well they come with these screws here
which<00:00:40.360> this<00:00:40.540> is<00:00:40.690> what<00:00:40.840> I<00:00:40.870> use<00:00:40.930> to<00:00:41.079> attach<00:00:41.680> to

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:41.950 
which this is what I use to attach to

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:44.729 
which this is what I use to attach to
the<00:00:42.040> furniture<00:00:42.460> itself<00:00:42.989> but<00:00:43.989> then<00:00:44.200> this<00:00:44.530> is

00:00:44.729 --> 00:00:44.739 
the furniture itself but then this is

00:00:44.739 --> 00:00:47.270 
the furniture itself but then this is
the<00:00:44.770> screw<00:00:45.130> i<00:00:45.190> use<00:00:45.430> to<00:00:45.760> go<00:00:45.880> into<00:00:46.270> the<00:00:46.960> studs

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280 
the screw i use to go into the studs

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.160 
the screw i use to go into the studs
into<00:00:48.280> the<00:00:48.399> ball<00:00:48.520> onto<00:00:48.610> the<00:00:48.790> wall<00:00:49.030> so<00:00:49.930> it<00:00:50.079> gives

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:50.170 
into the ball onto the wall so it gives

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:55.530 
into the ball onto the wall so it gives
it<00:00:50.350> a<00:00:50.410> nice<00:00:50.530> solid<00:00:50.860> I<00:00:52.440> guess<00:00:54.000> solid<00:00:55.000> connection

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:55.540 
it a nice solid I guess solid connection

00:00:55.540 --> 00:00:57.479 
it a nice solid I guess solid connection
and<00:00:56.350> then<00:00:56.440> these<00:00:56.530> smaller<00:00:56.890> screws<00:00:57.250> because<00:00:57.460> a

00:00:57.479 --> 00:00:57.489 
and then these smaller screws because a

00:00:57.489 --> 00:00:59.819 
and then these smaller screws because a
lot<00:00:57.610> of<00:00:57.640> times<00:00:57.910> your<00:00:58.120> furniture<00:00:58.570> the<00:00:59.500> woods

00:00:59.819 --> 00:00:59.829 
lot of times your furniture the woods

00:00:59.829 --> 00:01:01.620 
lot of times your furniture the woods
not<00:01:00.070> going<00:01:00.219> to<00:01:00.280> be<00:01:00.370> that<00:01:00.399> thick<00:01:00.910> so<00:01:01.360> you<00:01:01.450> need<00:01:01.570> a

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:01.630 
not going to be that thick so you need a

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:04.009 
not going to be that thick so you need a
shorter<00:01:02.020> screw<00:01:02.290> for<00:01:02.500> that<00:01:02.649> but<00:01:03.399> this<00:01:03.700> is<00:01:03.940> a

00:01:04.009 --> 00:01:04.019 
shorter screw for that but this is a

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:06.179 
shorter screw for that but this is a
long<00:01:05.019> enough<00:01:05.290> where<00:01:05.469> it's<00:01:05.740> still<00:01:05.920> staying

00:01:06.179 --> 00:01:06.189 
long enough where it's still staying

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:10.020 
long enough where it's still staying
really<00:01:06.399> good<00:01:07.500> so<00:01:08.500> in<00:01:09.310> this<00:01:09.609> piece<00:01:09.909> of

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.030 
really good so in this piece of

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:11.639 
really good so in this piece of
furniture<00:01:10.179> it's<00:01:10.600> one<00:01:10.780> of<00:01:10.869> the<00:01:10.990> law<00:01:11.109> why

00:01:11.639 --> 00:01:11.649 
furniture it's one of the law why

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:13.770 
furniture it's one of the law why
dressers<00:01:12.280> this<00:01:12.549> is<00:01:12.670> what<00:01:12.819> we<00:01:12.909> use<00:01:12.939> as<00:01:13.420> her

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:13.780 
dressers this is what we use as her

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.539 
dressers this is what we use as her
changing<00:01:14.409> table<00:01:14.889> and<00:01:15.840> what<00:01:16.840> we<00:01:16.990> did<00:01:17.289> is<00:01:17.439> we<00:01:17.549> put

00:01:18.539 --> 00:01:18.549 
changing table and what we did is we put

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:21.539 
changing table and what we did is we put
the<00:01:18.670> corner<00:01:18.999> brace<00:01:19.240> on<00:01:19.539> like<00:01:19.990> that<00:01:20.259> using<00:01:21.189> the

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:21.549 
the corner brace on like that using the

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:23.760 
the corner brace on like that using the
screw<00:01:22.029> that<00:01:22.209> comes<00:01:22.479> with<00:01:22.810> the<00:01:22.929> package<00:01:22.959> here

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:23.770 
screw that comes with the package here

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.999 
screw that comes with the package here
and<00:01:23.920> then<00:01:24.609> the<00:01:25.389> screw<00:01:25.990> that<00:01:26.139> we<00:01:26.350> had<00:01:26.560> going

00:01:26.999 --> 00:01:27.009 
and then the screw that we had going

00:01:27.009 --> 00:01:29.340 
and then the screw that we had going
into<00:01:27.249> the<00:01:27.459> wall<00:01:27.670> also<00:01:28.569> because<00:01:28.749> we<00:01:29.109> do<00:01:29.200> have

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:29.350 
into the wall also because we do have

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:35.879 
into the wall also because we do have
trim<00:01:29.740> on<00:01:30.009> our<00:01:32.609> walls<00:01:33.609> so<00:01:34.359> it<00:01:34.599> does<00:01:34.869> you<00:01:35.709> have<00:01:35.859> a

00:01:35.879 --> 00:01:35.889 
trim on our walls so it does you have a

00:01:35.889 --> 00:01:37.739 
trim on our walls so it does you have a
bit<00:01:36.069> of<00:01:36.099> a<00:01:36.249> separation<00:01:36.700> so<00:01:37.090> it<00:01:37.209> does<00:01:37.389> help<00:01:37.659> to

00:01:37.739 --> 00:01:37.749 
bit of a separation so it does help to

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:40.980 
bit of a separation so it does help to
use<00:01:38.139> the<00:01:38.709> longer<00:01:39.219> screw<00:01:39.549> to<00:01:39.819> go<00:01:39.939> into<00:01:40.209> the<00:01:40.810> wall

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:40.990 
use the longer screw to go into the wall

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:44.309 
use the longer screw to go into the wall
so<00:01:41.859> now<00:01:42.399> we<00:01:43.119> thought<00:01:43.420> we<00:01:43.599> would<00:01:43.630> use<00:01:43.929> two<00:01:44.289> of

00:01:44.309 --> 00:01:44.319 
so now we thought we would use two of

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:47.669 
so now we thought we would use two of
those<00:01:44.759> corner<00:01:45.759> pieces<00:01:45.969> on<00:01:46.359> this<00:01:46.659> piece<00:01:46.959> but

00:01:47.669 --> 00:01:47.679 
those corner pieces on this piece but

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:51.209 
those corner pieces on this piece but
actually<00:01:48.279> it<00:01:48.549> is<00:01:48.990> really<00:01:49.990> really<00:01:50.469> security

00:01:51.209 --> 00:01:51.219 
actually it is really really security

00:01:51.219 --> 00:01:53.849 
actually it is really really security
did<00:01:51.369> the<00:01:51.520> same<00:01:51.789> thing<00:01:51.819> with<00:01:52.689> this<00:01:53.319> tall<00:01:53.619> one

00:01:53.849 --> 00:01:53.859 
did the same thing with this tall one

00:01:53.859 --> 00:01:58.199 
did the same thing with this tall one
here<00:01:54.340> and<00:01:54.490> we<00:01:55.419> just<00:01:55.689> use<00:01:55.929> the<00:01:56.499> one<00:01:57.340> corner

00:01:58.199 --> 00:01:58.209 
here and we just use the one corner

00:01:58.209 --> 00:02:02.309 
here and we just use the one corner
bracket<00:01:58.630> with<00:01:59.049> that<00:01:59.259> and<00:02:00.159> then<00:02:01.319> this

00:02:02.309 --> 00:02:02.319 
bracket with that and then this

00:02:02.319 --> 00:02:05.879 
bracket with that and then this
bookshelf<00:02:03.249> here<00:02:03.789> I<00:02:03.999> went<00:02:04.749> and<00:02:05.049> I<00:02:05.200> pretty<00:02:05.770> much

00:02:05.879 --> 00:02:05.889 
bookshelf here I went and I pretty much

00:02:05.889 --> 00:02:07.709 
bookshelf here I went and I pretty much
we're<00:02:06.579> getting<00:02:06.789> rid<00:02:06.909> of<00:02:06.999> like<00:02:07.179> all<00:02:07.389> that

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:07.719 
we're getting rid of like all that

we're getting rid of like all that
what's<00:02:08.050> on<00:02:08.229> there<00:02:08.440> right<00:02:08.649> now<00:02:08.970> still<00:02:09.970> and<00:02:10.300> then

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:11.020 
what's on there right now still and then

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:13.260 
what's on there right now still and then
we're<00:02:11.650> going<00:02:11.860> to<00:02:11.950> put<00:02:12.010> her<00:02:12.280> toys<00:02:12.580> and<00:02:12.910> stuff<00:02:13.120> in
