Hello, this is selfmade Beef Jerky

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:10.000
really easy to make. And how to make it.. i will show you here on

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.500
"BBQ aus Rheinhessen"
Have fun!

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.200
Making Beef Jerky on your own is really simple...

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:52.500
All you need is a Food dehydrator. you may get it for 40$ at Amazon...

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.500
Normally you need it to dry Fruits or Vegetables.

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:57.100
i just use it to dry Beef :)

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.100
and you will need

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.500
thin cut Beef (Rouladen) and a Marinade...

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:04.680
This is the Beef Marinade from Hot Mamas

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:11.600
and that´s it! The Rouladen Cut has only Little of fat

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:18.100
and is already cut thinn. So it´s perfect for Beef Jerky.

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:23.100
I will cut the Rouladen into stripes, marinate them and dehydrate them.

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.100
How simple is that?!?

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:32.300
The Beef is prepared.. cut it into 2 cm stripes.

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.000
It´s perfect for making Beef Jerky.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Now i am going to Marinade the Beef. Just add 3-4 Tablespoons.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:02:03.000
This is 1.8 kg of Beef. Because i made Beef Jerky for several times now.. i know that´s this is the amount the Food dehydrator can handle.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:10.000
about 10 Rouladen slices. Let´s mix this up so that it´s all marinaded-

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:20.300
Smells wonderful.. Contains Chipotle Chili.. As i like it spicy... it´s perfect for me.

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:29.329
The Beef mustn´t lay in a lake of Marinade.. it´s covered a little bit.

00:02:29.329 --> 00:02:31.139
because we want to dehydrate...

00:02:31.139 --> 00:02:34.099
so we want to loose the water

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:41.000
the more liquid is in the Beef.. the more time it will take...

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:46.200
When the Beef is covered with Marinade... lid on top...

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:53.289
and let it rest in the fridge for 2 hours. And then it´s time for our Food dehydrator....

00:02:53.289 --> 00:03:10.900
2 hours later.. it´s time to fill in the Beef in the Food dehydrator.....

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:29.000
This is how it Looks like... and now it´s 9 hours in the Food dehydrator.. and our Beef Jerky is done!

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:37.349
Now i have 2 bags of Beef jerky here...

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:41.469
The Beef Jerky on the right was in the dehydrator for 9 hours..

00:03:41.469 --> 00:03:45.609
and the Beef jerky here.. for 12 hours...

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:48.649
This one is still soft... and has a nice chew..

00:03:48.649 --> 00:03:51.709
and this one

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:56.290
is like Beef crisps... a wonderfull Snack!

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:58.959
realy crunchy

00:03:58.959 --> 00:04:03.839
i always make 2 styles of Beef jerky

00:04:03.839 --> 00:04:04.899
to have the choice

00:04:04.899 --> 00:04:08.619
The Marinade is really awesome... just a light hottness

00:04:08.619 --> 00:04:09.409
on the Beef jerky

00:04:09.409 --> 00:04:13.139
really delicious, easy to make, not much work

00:04:13.139 --> 00:04:20.139
you should try this and if you dont have a Food dehydrator.. Think about to buy one:)

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:30.579
