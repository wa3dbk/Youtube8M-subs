00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.549

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.410

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.680
 also the stay online 

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:07.500
 then we dry 

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:11.000
 with a wipe we dry very well 

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:11.000
 our hands 

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:14.560
 yes yes 

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:21.590
 we arrived very very well then what 

00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:24.019
 we do is that we apply 

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:28.040
 here I have some oil that I'm going to 

00:03:24.019 --> 00:03:33.310
 show what we can apply the oil of 

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:38.590
 garlic directly to our nails too 

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:41.379
 we can apply olive oil 

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:45.910
 we can also apply these oils 

00:03:41.379 --> 00:03:49.660
 that we buy in stores here I have 

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:53.590
 sweet almond oil and here then 

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:58.090
 I have this soap that is to put 

00:03:53.590 --> 00:04:01.720
 strong nails and this one is also very 

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:05.490
 good to use this 

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:05.490
 and I'm going to put my oil 

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:14.870
 in the nails directly 

00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:18.480
 just like what I'm doing 

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:20.450
 in all the nails we are going to put the 

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:24.370
 transit 

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:24.370
 around the cuticle 

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:29.770
 but 

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:47.190
 and this will help us 

00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:50.010
 and strengthen our nails 

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:52.740
 and this treatment I recommend it 

00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:54.990
 do it during the night 

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:58.560
 at the time they go to sleep they do 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:05:00.800
 your treatment and then they go to the 

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.800
 bed 

00:05:01.849 --> 00:05:08.069
 because that way they can leave their oil in 

00:05:05.909 --> 00:05:10.449
 your nails then what they have to do 

00:05:08.069 --> 00:05:13.180
 is to give him a massage 

00:05:10.449 --> 00:05:17.270
 with their oil they can use the oil 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:19.600
 olive sweet almond oil 

00:05:17.270 --> 00:05:24.460
 garlic oil 

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:29.730
 and this is very good to strengthen your 

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:29.730
 Nails is a very very good treatment 

00:05:30.260 --> 00:05:37.730
 You can also use a cream for your 

00:05:35.450 --> 00:05:40.370
 hands of vitamin is that it is also very 

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:43.160
 good this cream for the hands and 

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:47.180
 strengthen the nails 

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:51.590
 and girls that's all the treatment for 

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:53.810
