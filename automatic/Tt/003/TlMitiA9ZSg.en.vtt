00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.130
 so we are back to the experience 

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:08.280
 I came before him horny simulator 2010 

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:10.050
 and we have new new order 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.049
 we got perform test drive 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:16.590
 and replace award parts that means everyone 

00:00:13.049 --> 00:00:18.810
 party in the car have to get warm 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:20.939
 we expand because that is not good if 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:24.510
 that get too warm and overheat 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:26.039
 then these parts are not so 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.699
 functional as they actually are 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:28.320
 should 

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:30.380
 I do not know how to explain it 

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:33.840
 you'll see it soon 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:38.520
 driving bambi red here still in front 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:41.219
 with the sec and replace why with space 

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.770
 that means the front place lulled in the 

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:46.559
 not so good now we have 

00:00:43.770 --> 00:00:47.899
 But the problem of the car is here 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:51.930
 and is cold 

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:54.629
 that is when we get the skeleton 

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:57.480
 make a view and we are now word 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.850
 place so and and should now warm 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:01.680
 Then you see everything is cold 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.979
 except that this is a bit up front 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:07.020
 That's something if you still have it there 

00:01:04.979 --> 00:01:09.299
 we hold the problem that somehow 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.979
 not working properly that means we 

00:01:09.299 --> 00:01:11.760
 first have to do a test ride now 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:13.650
 to do the car 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:18.360
 you may even be happy 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:19.920
 because that's something different because 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:25.070
 through this test drive we can 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.070
 Find out what gets warm in the car 

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.799
 so 

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:46.259
 rupps now we know brakes 

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:46.259
 test 

00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:53.119
 now comes the slalom 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:55.680
 is not so easy with the villages 

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:59.210
 The procedure just looks like that 

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.210
 but it pivots very much 

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:04.320
 Euro 

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.750
 and now again the last test 

00:02:21.019 --> 00:02:25.319
 but everything can be tested now 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:28.590
 We also look which parts really on 

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:30.629
 car get hot and replaced 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:32.760
 will lure this one 

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:34.530
 So this year crack through this 

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.379
 hot means that's what we mean 

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:39.840
 do so now ridley scott and then 

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:42.030
 she is performing again test 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.760
 drive and then here again description 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:47.510
 of work also description description 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.860
 The work means that 's just 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:53.970
 then explain it again in more detail while 

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:57.900
 driving when i drive bankrupt from 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:03:00.450
 hawking so then I hear no crack 

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:04.109
 in the front of my mature so in 

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:05.819
 the in the real area and the mature of the 

00:03:04.109 --> 00:03:07.440
 mature he hears I can not do that 

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:09.150
 I know what that means 

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:11.489
 but sometimes I do not come to this 

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:13.109
 names so i know exactly when you man 

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:15.269
 I understand that all but written 

00:03:13.109 --> 00:03:17.190
 I can not translate that's how 

00:03:15.269 --> 00:03:18.480
 as if someone i have no idea and that 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:22.349
 I should understand it 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:23.660
 just like that and we are already in 

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:31.290
 the dare 

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:34.349
 which means red is too warm and cherry 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:36.299
 Pentling yells that's what I think 

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:38.010
 a bit about stabilization and even 

00:03:36.299 --> 00:03:41.040
 to get three that's hot and there 

00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:41.700
 over there is only one hot but that 

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.160
 is cool 

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:47.220
 that means we need two of them 

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.549
 Two of them have one of them all 

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.400
 clear 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:56.010
 then we go shopping first 

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:59.060
 We go shopping so that's where it is 

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:59.060
 is in operation 

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:08.880
 is it where is it 100 dollars 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:17.440
 quite a lot of my miss as well 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:19.720
 others did so swing and bar left and 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:20.829
 ride that is 200 dollars we have 

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.579
 only for the parts now 

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:26.200
 output 

00:04:21.579 --> 00:04:27.910
 Here we get for the mission 300 

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:29.800
 dollar means $ 100 profit 

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:31.540
 then usually comes the 

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:33.639
 workload so that means we have to 

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:34.770
 First, make the mature now 

00:04:33.639 --> 00:04:37.000
 we do not come back ran 

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:40.410
 I think that's all 

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.410
 make the tires loose 

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:45.240
 then let's go here 

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:53.610
 so that participants build out of the thing 

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:56.830
 also and away with it 

00:04:53.610 --> 00:05:00.090
 and now replay cen and then we build 

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:00.090
 a new part 1 

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:08.410
 looks great on me like that 

00:05:05.919 --> 00:05:10.260
 play really mega class new mature can 

00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:17.520
 you soon need it too 

00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:20.560
 60% worn tires are dangerous 

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:23.800
 dangerous but not our problem 

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:27.910
 problem he drives the car so replays 

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:32.130
 replacing that's just yes is already 

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:34.090
 Inside replays so that means mature out 

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:35.830
 that too cool that you always have this 

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:37.210
 to dismantle all screws must be remembered 

00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:40.450
 me always on earlier if I mean 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:42.060
 I had to change tires at 1 

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:46.390
 Even the mature change as 

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:51.910
 young knabl was a bit younger 

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:55.390
 Let's just do it that's fine 

00:05:51.910 --> 00:05:59.140
 and the part also zack 

00:05:55.390 --> 00:06:02.320
 that means we're doing playstation now 

00:05:59.140 --> 00:06:05.500
 now the new things nice and pure then 

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:13.600
 the driver is happy and we are 

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:19.230
 are it so new then out of here 

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:19.230
 out of sight and mature again 

00:06:25.110 --> 00:06:32.980
 but then we can get out there 

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:36.220
 look perfect 300 dollars earned 

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:38.650
 200 issued repair complete we see 

00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:41.560
 us in the next step 

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:43.980
 Thanks again for watching until 

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:43.980
 next time
