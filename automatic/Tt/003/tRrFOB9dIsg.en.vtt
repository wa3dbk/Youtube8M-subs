00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:14.160
 a beef tongue is coming so 

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:17.420
 I have an idea how much it weighed because I pulled 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.420
 the bag and then I'm not going to take it out 

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:25.830
 but it's pretty big if it's okay 

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:28.220
 in this in this type of plastic 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.980
 Well, I'm going to take it out 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:34.809
 as I left it unfreezing because it was 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.809
 a little blood came out 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.680
 let's bleed the good so that 

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:44.780
 this 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:46.100
 do not have a very bad taste when it comes to 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:48.680
 eat 

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.860
 We're going to break it into pieces, I'll go 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.840
 from 

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:56.270
 I think so 

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:58.280
 so they are sewn faster because if 

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:00.980
 they put it complete is never going to be 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:05.470
 good if you know but it takes the little thing 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:05.470
 a lot is like that it's going to take longer 

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:19.420
 what I 'm going to do is put it in this 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:21.690
 mold with water ok to bleed to 

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:24.540
 let him bleed 

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:28.250
 and later it is what next to my 

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:28.250
 things that I will need to 

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:35.270
 to know them because this was bleeding 

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:37.369
 how are you going back in the 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:40.390
 tongue and it's wider because I'm going to 

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:40.390
 Split in half 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.100
 put him 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:51.140
 s 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:51.140
 of blood and to wash it also 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.560
 First 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:02.770
 you play sporadically 

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:11.880
 until you see more or less more or 

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:11.880
 less water comes out clearer 

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:18.880
 We reserve them in what we prepare 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:22.060
 all the things that we are going to need 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:24.640
 to sew our tongue 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:28.840
 so to know our language we are going to 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:32.770
 need onion a big piece in 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:35.000
 onion carrying I'm going to occupy this and 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:39.260
 this other 

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:41.390
 That's because I have leftovers 

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:44.240
 then these works are going to occupy 

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:46.850
 for my house if they have gone to our page 

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:48.380
 from facebook they have noticed that we have left 

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:50.600
 some tips 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:54.020
 one of them was this to put the 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:56.270
 onion so that it does not break down in 

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:58.670
 all the caldito that they do or any 

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:01.340
 thing in which they need to sew the 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:02.390
 onion like that and it's a very good guy ok 

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:05.900
 good 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:10.340
 I'm going to put it here too and we're going to 

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:15.440
 need garlic I'm going to put half 

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:18.050
 little head of garlic and then also if not 

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:20.150
 they have this garlic so be the 

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:22.910
 head together so you do not get messed up 

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:26.450
 because you can use them and 

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:32.769
 put them in this way true 

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:32.769
 we are going to occupy leaves either of laurel 

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:43.240
 If I fail, I will use these sheets 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:46.860
 of avocado 3-4 leaves we are going to 

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:50.800
 need 5 cloves 

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:53.610
 and 10 peppers 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.610
 and salt 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:19.110
 let's try to open the language 

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:24.639
 enough as if we were 

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:30.370
 making a broth that was on the stove 

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:33.219
 for about two hours ok inside 

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:34.479
 two hours we will check more or less 

00:04:33.219 --> 00:04:36.639
 how are they 

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:39.599
 it's like we made a call we're going to 

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:39.599
 take it to the extreme 

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:52.660
 so let's try to have our sauce 

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:56.360
 our cilantro and our onion before 

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:58.750
 that our language is ready 

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:01.759
 Well, let's get the tongue out 

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:04.340
 after two hours and we will remove 

00:05:01.759 --> 00:05:08.030
 all the upper body with a lot 

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:09.919
 care because it is hot 

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:13.340
 it must be hot to be 

00:05:09.919 --> 00:05:15.620
 easier to take it off so nothing else is 

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:19.939
 to pull the white old man they have 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:23.150
 up is easier if you cut it 

00:05:19.939 --> 00:05:28.280
 by the top part first as well as 

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:31.550
 from there they cut him and they pull 

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:36.069
 out and look come is a lot 

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:39.199
 much easier to remove the 

00:05:36.069 --> 00:05:40.969
 little skin they have to remove when 

00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:43.090
 be hot because if it is removed 

00:05:40.969 --> 00:05:44.900
 good is cold is very very difficult 

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:49.130
 remove it 

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:51.320
 We are going to chop the meat and since we have 

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:56.380
 a little bit chopped let's put in a mold 

00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:56.380
 caldito cited the language 

00:05:56.470 --> 00:06:04.030
 to be able to reserve the in the caldito and 

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:07.410
 I know that it stays warm while 

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:07.410
 we make our sacks 

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:17.340
 my husband and my daughter like them a lot 

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:20.070
 the nerves so in the part of up 

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:23.070
 back from behind the tongue I so 

00:06:20.070 --> 00:06:26.340
 general always always kept them and 

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:29.820
 this and I prepare them with saleh appointment and 

00:06:26.340 --> 00:06:34.200
 with lemon so they are there like that 

00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:36.550
 judging while I finish preparing 

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:41.340
 this 

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:41.340
 Well, the taquitos and all that truth 

00:06:53.500 --> 00:07:00.250
 there is I'll take finally 

00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:04.690
 tortillas a tip is that they pass through 

00:07:00.250 --> 00:07:07.840
 oil and the hot ones is easier this 

00:07:04.690 --> 00:07:10.780
 I recommend that you serve them 

00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:13.280
 a spoon with eyes down or like me 

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:18.810
 an east 

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:20.890
 to a clamp to get the meat 

00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:23.050
 finally I am I already took it to my 

00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:27.750
 husband like that and he prepares them like him 

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:27.750
 I want and I hope you liked it bye 

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:40.520
 of death 

00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:50.790
 5 2
