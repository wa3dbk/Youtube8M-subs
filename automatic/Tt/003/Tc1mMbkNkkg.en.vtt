00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:41.050 
some skill was as you can see I should

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:42.870 
some skill was as you can see I should
have<00:03:41.170> probably<00:03:41.380> gone<00:03:41.740> with<00:03:42.190> the<00:03:42.280> chip<00:03:42.550> shot<00:03:42.730> or

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:42.880 
have probably gone with the chip shot or

00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:44.040 
have probably gone with the chip shot or
something<00:03:43.210> but<00:03:43.360> unfortunately<00:03:43.930> his

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:44.050 
something but unfortunately his

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:46.230 
something but unfortunately his
goalkeeper<00:03:44.470> came<00:03:44.830> out<00:03:45.070> and<00:03:45.280> yeah<00:03:45.640> he<00:03:46.090> picked

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:46.240 
goalkeeper came out and yeah he picked

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.060 
goalkeeper came out and yeah he picked
the<00:03:46.390> ball<00:03:46.510> up<00:03:46.570> really<00:03:46.930> easily<00:03:47.200> and<00:03:47.590> I<00:03:47.650> look<00:03:47.890> at

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:48.070 
the ball up really easily and I look at

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:49.980 
the ball up really easily and I look at
this<00:03:48.190> from<00:03:48.610> a<00:03:48.640> corner<00:03:49.150> again<00:03:49.300> I<00:03:49.690> don't<00:03:49.900> know

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:49.990 
this from a corner again I don't know

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:52.290 
this from a corner again I don't know
how<00:03:50.170> that<00:03:50.230> one<00:03:50.530> went<00:03:50.650> in<00:03:50.800> but<00:03:51.040> the<00:03:51.940> amount<00:03:52.180> of

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:52.300 
how that one went in but the amount of

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:54.570 
how that one went in but the amount of
local<00:03:52.510> deco<00:03:53.020> was<00:03:53.230> absolutely<00:03:53.770> insane<00:03:54.160> you<00:03:54.370> can

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:54.580 
local deco was absolutely insane you can

00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:56.640 
local deco was absolutely insane you can
maybe<00:03:54.970> kind<00:03:55.570> of<00:03:55.660> compare<00:03:56.020> to<00:03:56.200> the<00:03:56.320> goal<00:03:56.500> we

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:56.650 
maybe kind of compare to the goal we

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:58.650 
maybe kind of compare to the goal we
scored<00:03:56.920> yesterday<00:03:57.310> with<00:03:57.490> Hulk<00:03:57.730> but<00:03:57.970> that<00:03:58.510> was

00:03:58.650 --> 00:03:58.660 
scored yesterday with Hulk but that was

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:00.210 
scored yesterday with Hulk but that was
absolutely<00:03:59.080> ridiculous<00:03:59.530> but<00:03:59.830> I<00:03:59.890> yeah<00:04:00.100> he

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:00.220 
absolutely ridiculous but I yeah he

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:01.920 
absolutely ridiculous but I yeah he
makes<00:04:00.400> it<00:04:00.520> 4-2<00:04:00.760> as<00:04:00.970> well<00:04:01.150> that<00:04:01.300> was<00:04:01.450> a<00:04:01.480> decent

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:01.930 
makes it 4-2 as well that was a decent

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:04.200 
makes it 4-2 as well that was a decent
goal<00:04:02.350> by<00:04:02.500> by<00:04:03.040> a<00:04:03.070> menace<00:04:03.460> I<00:04:03.580> would<00:04:03.760> say<00:04:03.940> but<00:04:04.120> then

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:04.210 
goal by by a menace I would say but then

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:06.840 
goal by by a menace I would say but then
look<00:04:04.330> at<00:04:04.450> this<00:04:04.570> in<00:04:04.720> the<00:04:04.810> 84th<00:04:05.380> minute<00:04:05.550> we<00:04:06.550> shoot

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:06.850

goalkeeper saves them from the rebound

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:32.530 
goalkeeper saves them from the rebound
he<00:04:30.440> managed<00:04:31.040> to<00:04:31.100> clear<00:04:31.490> it<00:04:31.580> away<00:04:31.669> with<00:04:31.970> Thiago

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:32.540

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:34.450 
he managed to clear it away with Thiago
Silva<00:04:33.080> and<00:04:33.530> that<00:04:33.650> is<00:04:33.770> pretty<00:04:33.980> much<00:04:34.160> how<00:04:34.220> that

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:34.460 
Silva and that is pretty much how that

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:36.640 
Silva and that is pretty much how that
game<00:04:34.699> in<00:04:34.850> that<00:04:34.970> we<00:04:35.150> lost<00:04:35.360> the<00:04:35.510> game<00:04:35.660> 4-3<00:04:36.169> I

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:36.650 
game in that we lost the game 4-3 I

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:38.409 
game in that we lost the game 4-3 I
think<00:04:37.340> we<00:04:37.430> had<00:04:37.520> like<00:04:37.669> a<00:04:37.699> similar<00:04:38.090> amount<00:04:38.240> of

00:04:38.409 --> 00:04:38.419 
think we had like a similar amount of

00:04:38.419 --> 00:04:40.330 
think we had like a similar amount of
shots<00:04:38.630> on<00:04:38.720> target<00:04:38.780> so<00:04:39.320> maybe<00:04:39.590> maybe<00:04:40.070> I<00:04:40.160> could

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:40.340 
shots on target so maybe maybe I could

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:41.920 
shots on target so maybe maybe I could
have<00:04:40.430> gotten<00:04:40.699> another<00:04:40.880> go<00:04:41.360> back<00:04:41.660> but

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:41.930 
have gotten another go back but

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:43.810 
have gotten another go back but
unfortunately<00:04:42.800> we<00:04:43.010> didn't<00:04:43.400> so<00:04:43.520> we<00:04:43.639> lost

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:43.820 
unfortunately we didn't so we lost

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:45.670 
unfortunately we didn't so we lost
another<00:04:44.120> game<00:04:44.240> got<00:04:45.050> really<00:04:45.290> do<00:04:45.410> anything
