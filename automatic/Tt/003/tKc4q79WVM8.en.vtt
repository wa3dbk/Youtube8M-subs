familiar on how to wash and condition
your<00:00:19.980> weave<00:00:20.220> I<00:00:20.369> do<00:00:20.430> have<00:00:20.640> a<00:00:20.670> video<00:00:20.850> on<00:00:21.029> that<00:00:21.270> but

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:22.199 
your weave I do have a video on that but

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:24.529 
your weave I do have a video on that but
the<00:00:22.859> extensions<00:00:23.430> that<00:00:23.550> I<00:00:23.609> chose<00:00:23.850> are<00:00:24.180> in<00:00:24.390> a

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
the extensions that I chose are in a

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.509 
the extensions that I chose are in a
straight<00:00:24.900> texture<00:00:25.350> I<00:00:25.380> have<00:00:25.619> no<00:00:26.010> idea<00:00:26.340> what

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
straight texture I have no idea what

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.160 
straight texture I have no idea what
made<00:00:26.670> me<00:00:26.820> select<00:00:27.210> straight<00:00:27.750> because<00:00:28.080> I

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
made me select straight because I

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:30.620 
made me select straight because I
normally<00:00:28.500> go<00:00:28.650> with<00:00:29.369> wavy<00:00:29.670> or<00:00:29.849> curly<00:00:30.029> other

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
normally go with wavy or curly other

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:32.209 
normally go with wavy or curly other
than<00:00:30.900> me<00:00:31.080> just<00:00:31.170> wanting<00:00:31.439> something<00:00:31.769> different

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:32.219 
than me just wanting something different

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.090 
than me just wanting something different
and<00:00:32.790> the<00:00:32.910> reason<00:00:33.239> why<00:00:33.360> is<00:00:33.420> because<00:00:33.860> wave<00:00:34.860> your

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:35.100 
and the reason why is because wave your

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.740 
and the reason why is because wave your
curly<00:00:35.399> extensions<00:00:35.790> can<00:00:35.940> be<00:00:36.000> washed<00:00:36.300> and<00:00:36.600> we're

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:36.750 
curly extensions can be washed and we're

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.410 
curly extensions can be washed and we're
out<00:00:36.989> the<00:00:37.140> door<00:00:37.170> so<00:00:37.680> I'm<00:00:37.950> pressed<00:00:38.430> for<00:00:38.520> time<00:00:38.670> so

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:39.420 
out the door so I'm pressed for time so

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.389 
out the door so I'm pressed for time so
I<00:00:39.450> went<00:00:39.750> ahead<00:00:39.809> and<00:00:39.989> blow<00:00:40.379> dried<00:00:40.649> the<00:00:40.860> hair<00:00:40.890> so

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:52.410 
with straight hair and I am going to be

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:54.830 
with straight hair and I am going to be
using<00:00:52.590> the<00:00:53.520> good<00:00:53.820> hair<00:00:54.000> in<00:00:54.090> a<00:00:54.149> bottle

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840 
using the good hair in a bottle

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.680 
using the good hair in a bottle
good<00:00:55.289> hair<00:00:55.469> is<00:00:55.559> resilient<00:00:56.039> styling<00:00:56.430> foam<00:00:56.690> this

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:57.690 
good hair is resilient styling foam this

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.599 
good hair is resilient styling foam this
is<00:00:57.870> just<00:00:58.050> to<00:00:58.140> give<00:00:58.320> me<00:00:58.530> like<00:00:58.859> I<00:00:58.949> said<00:00:59.100> some<00:00:59.280> hold

00:00:59.599 --> 00:00:59.609 
is just to give me like I said some hold

00:00:59.609 --> 00:01:02.000 
is just to give me like I said some hold
because<00:01:00.239> that<00:01:00.570> is<00:01:00.750> usually<00:01:00.930> the<00:01:01.140> culprit

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:02.010 
because that is usually the culprit

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.429 
because that is usually the culprit
I<00:01:02.039> have<00:01:02.640> straightened<00:01:03.000> my<00:01:03.239> edges<00:01:03.809> but<00:01:04.080> because

00:01:04.429 --> 00:01:04.439 
I have straightened my edges but because

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:08.300 
I have straightened my edges but because
that<00:01:04.650> product<00:01:04.949> that<00:01:05.369> foam<00:01:05.880> is<00:01:06.270> a<00:01:07.200> little<00:01:08.070> wet

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310 
that product that foam is a little wet

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.920 
that product that foam is a little wet
I'm<00:01:08.549> going<00:01:08.729> to<00:01:08.790> make<00:01:08.909> sure<00:01:09.119> that<00:01:09.270> I<00:01:09.330> separate

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:09.930 
I'm going to make sure that I separate

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.480 
I'm going to make sure that I separate
my<00:01:10.170> hair<00:01:10.560> from<00:01:11.070> the<00:01:11.880> extensions<00:01:12.860> now<00:01:13.860> if<00:01:14.280> you

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:25.290 
or even a hair spray would be a little

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.249 
or even a hair spray would be a little
bit<00:01:25.350> better<00:01:25.530> for<00:01:25.830> you<00:01:25.979> for<00:01:26.610> this<00:01:26.759> so<00:01:27.689> I'm<00:01:28.110> just

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:17.130 
diffuser and basically I held it on to
each<00:04:14.860> area<00:04:15.220> for<00:04:15.820> like<00:04:16.209> one<00:04:16.450> to<00:04:16.570> two<00:04:16.630> minutes

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:17.140 
each area for like one to two minutes

00:04:17.140 --> 00:04:19.830 
each area for like one to two minutes
and<00:04:17.260> it<00:04:18.220> took<00:04:18.400> maybe<00:04:18.519> ten<00:04:18.850> minutes<00:04:19.000> total<00:04:19.420> that

00:04:19.830 --> 00:04:19.840 
and it took maybe ten minutes total that

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.680 
and it took maybe ten minutes total that
I<00:04:19.900> left<00:04:20.350> the<00:04:20.560> rollers<00:04:20.950> in<00:04:21.160> and<00:04:21.670> that<00:04:22.300> made<00:04:22.510> it

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:22.690 
I left the rollers in and that made it

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:24.870 
I left the rollers in and that made it
super<00:04:23.020> fast<00:04:23.410> much<00:04:23.800> faster<00:04:24.220> than<00:04:24.340> going<00:04:24.580> from

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:24.880 
super fast much faster than going from

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:26.430 
super fast much faster than going from
constantly<00:04:25.300> damp<00:04:25.570> hair<00:04:25.810> and<00:04:26.050> doing<00:04:26.260> a
