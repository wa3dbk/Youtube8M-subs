now you can download Google Earth to
your<00:00:13.139> iPhone<00:00:13.590> and<00:00:13.799> just<00:00:14.309> like<00:00:14.519> the<00:00:14.880> PC<00:00:15.509> and<00:00:15.780> Mac

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
entire globe now you will need a speedy

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.380 
entire globe now you will need a speedy
data<00:00:22.020> connection<00:00:22.650> so<00:00:22.920> it's<00:00:23.189> worth<00:00:23.789> using<00:00:24.150> this

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:24.390 
data connection so it's worth using this

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.420 
data connection so it's worth using this
in<00:00:24.539> a<00:00:24.600> Wi-Fi<00:00:25.019> hotspot<00:00:25.050> rather<00:00:25.830> than<00:00:26.099> relying

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430 
in a Wi-Fi hotspot rather than relying

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.179 
in a Wi-Fi hotspot rather than relying
on<00:00:26.640> 3g<00:00:27.269> but<00:00:27.930> once<00:00:28.560> you've<00:00:28.710> got<00:00:28.830> that<00:00:28.859> data

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:29.189 
on 3g but once you've got that data

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.250 
on 3g but once you've got that data
connection<00:00:29.699> you<00:00:29.970> can<00:00:30.300> use<00:00:30.689> the<00:00:30.869> iphones

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:31.260

and then revel in this incredible
satellite<00:00:40.710> imagery<00:00:41.250> now<00:00:41.730> the<00:00:42.180> animation<00:00:42.719> is

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
satellite imagery now the animation is

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.080 
satellite imagery now the animation is
is<00:00:43.290> very<00:00:43.440> slick<00:00:44.190> particularly<00:00:44.730> considering

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:45.090 
is very slick particularly considering

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:47.690 
is very slick particularly considering
the<00:00:45.750> limited<00:00:45.989> processing<00:00:46.530> power<00:00:47.100> of<00:00:47.460> the

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:47.700 
the limited processing power of the

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.940 
the limited processing power of the
iphone<00:00:47.730> and<00:00:48.480> of<00:00:49.050> course<00:00:49.260> it<00:00:49.410> makes<00:00:49.559> the<00:00:49.739> most

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:49.950 
iphone and of course it makes the most

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.520 
iphone and of course it makes the most
of<00:00:50.190> the<00:00:50.340> iphones<00:00:50.730> multi-touch<00:00:51.449> interface<00:00:51.719> so

of the iphones multi-touch interface so

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.040 
of the iphones multi-touch interface so
you<00:00:52.620> can<00:00:52.739> zoom<00:00:53.100> right<00:00:53.489> into<00:00:53.789> these<00:00:54.329> incredibly

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 
you can zoom right into these incredibly

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.740 
you can zoom right into these incredibly
detailed<00:00:55.649> satellite<00:00:55.890> shots<00:00:56.520> at<00:00:57.059> street<00:00:57.539> level

detailed satellite shots at street level
move<00:00:58.649> around<00:00:59.010> pinch<00:00:59.760> to<00:01:00.149> zoom<00:01:00.180> out<00:01:00.690> and<00:01:01.020> even

00:01:01.939 --> 00:01:01.949 
move around pinch to zoom out and even

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:05.270 
move around pinch to zoom out and even
use<00:01:02.280> the<00:01:02.489> iphones<00:01:03.229> accelerometer<00:01:04.229> so<00:01:04.739> you're

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
use the iphones accelerometer so you're

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.740 
use the iphones accelerometer so you're
looking<00:01:05.400> straight<00:01:05.729> down<00:01:05.850> at<00:01:06.180> the<00:01:06.270> moment<00:01:06.630> if

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:06.750

will show you it now this isn't the only
way<00:01:16.320> to<00:01:16.380> see<00:01:16.799> the<00:01:16.979> horizon<00:01:17.670> but<00:01:17.700> it's<00:01:17.939> it's<00:01:18.689> a

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750 
way to see the horizon but it's it's a

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.240 
way to see the horizon but it's it's a
pretty<00:01:18.930> cool<00:01:19.170> way<00:01:19.200> of<00:01:19.350> doing<00:01:19.740> it<00:01:19.830> you<00:01:19.950> can<00:01:20.100> also

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
pretty cool way of doing it you can also

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:24.350
