00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:22.980
 hello to all and welcome to a 

00:00:19.829 --> 00:00:24.119
 redstone minecraft tutorial so for 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.070
 this episode we will see a 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.739
 item elevator so what is that 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.589
 it is an elevator to items al hout 

00:00:28.739 --> 00:00:33.360
 so very very simple to make and 

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:36.780
 requiring virtually no redstone 

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:39.390
 it requires 6 redstone 2 pistons 

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.210
 sticking a repeater and blocks of 

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:45.420
 glass so it's very very simple I 

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:48.239
 shows you the principle you put your 

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.909
 blocks here you want to send there 

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.189
 high at an infinite distance 

00:00:50.909 --> 00:00:55.229
 you can put as much height as 

00:00:53.189 --> 00:00:56.820
 you want so you press this 

00:00:55.229 --> 00:01:00.390
 button there the only button there is 

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:04.650
 in the system and you items see 

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:08.250
 show the column he rides it 

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:10.619
 quietly and at a speed of eight 

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.720
 second blocks which is pretty fast 

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.360
 good all this is a small system that 

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:18.030
 I did I'll show you that in a 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:21.450
 improvement in an upcoming tutorial 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:25.260
 so here you see very very 

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:28.050
 nice huh the principle really redstone 

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:30.260
 minimal so I suggest you move 

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:34.590
 at construction 

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:38.159
 so to build this TV said m 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:43.200
 you put a sticky piston with a 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:46.140
 block of glass then you will put 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:49.770
 glass blocks like these a little 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.810
 around I want to say except here or there 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:55.619
 you will put a small block of ice 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:58.380
 Here you will take the ice 

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:01.140
 2 of bind what I want to say is 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:03.210
 no glass is ice here is 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:08.679
 finally you will understand me so then 

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:11.829
 you will do your turn like this 

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:13.209
 one infinite distance one month I 

00:02:11.829 --> 00:02:16.959
 not going up very high I'm doing a 

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:19.000
 little ellipses time to note here 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:20.500
 so I decided to stop at this 

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.900
 height there we will not do very high 

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.889
 so now that you have this you 

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:28.290
 go fill in leaving a space here 

00:02:25.889 --> 00:02:30.639
 so that you can slide the loots 

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:33.719
 left you a space that you go 

00:02:30.639 --> 00:02:37.180
 fill and i tele here you have your 

00:02:33.719 --> 00:02:38.920
 your turn so we will make the base good 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:39.609
 you know, you do not need to 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.590
 me to do it 

00:02:39.609 --> 00:02:44.859
 I'm going to make her a hero of what 

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:47.470
 I like the emerald block even if 

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:51.430
 it hurts a little bit so here you go 

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:55.560
 then you will put a piston 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:59.379
 prove there you're going to put a piston 

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:02.469
 right here so that the block of 

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:06.040
 glass that's here are pushed and at 

00:03:02.469 --> 00:03:09.719
 beyond and the place to be pushed back so 

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:15.489
 then you will connect this piston there 

00:03:09.719 --> 00:03:18.190
 with a repeater set to two you 

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:19.659
 click once on it I repeat you 

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:23.379
 click once on it 

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:25.540
 sorry that's the red stone you're going to 

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:29.409
 connect so here I was wrong it takes 

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:31.900
 add a simply not like that 

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:33.729
 need for complications 

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:37.239
 so the button you're going to put a 

00:03:33.729 --> 00:03:39.479
 button sees you water connect you like 

00:03:37.239 --> 00:03:43.120
 these one an all everything very simple 

00:03:39.479 --> 00:03:48.370
 really extremely simple you put 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:51.159
 your button is logically here you are 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:53.709
 have your your elevator said m so if 

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:58.719
 I'm trying to see I'm going to put some of 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:04:03.409
 wool and 

00:03:58.719 --> 00:04:07.400
 they are sent upstairs 

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:10.189
 know there is a 100% reliability in 

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:11.780
 this in this invention there is no loot 

00:04:10.189 --> 00:04:13.819
 what will park on the sides or 

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:18.049
 that's the moment you put it well 

00:04:13.819 --> 00:04:21.380
 this tower like these of 3 out of 3 the 

00:04:18.049 --> 00:04:25.389
 100% reliability so well here you go 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:27.500
 I hope you enjoyed this tutorial 

00:04:25.389 --> 00:04:28.280
