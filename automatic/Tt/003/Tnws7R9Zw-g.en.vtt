00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:49.240 
happens is it will have these you can
have<00:03:45.769> all<00:03:46.010> these<00:03:46.160> the<00:03:46.489> only<00:03:47.000> top<00:03:47.590> so<00:03:48.590> top<00:03:48.830> so

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:49.250 
have all these the only top so top so

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:53.020 
have all these the only top so top so
here<00:03:49.489> as<00:03:49.640> you<00:03:49.730> could<00:03:49.880> see<00:03:51.250> only<00:03:52.250> top<00:03:52.670> so<00:03:52.940> you

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.030 
here as you could see only top so you

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:54.940 
here as you could see only top so you
don't<00:03:53.269> need<00:03:53.420> to<00:03:53.690> go<00:03:53.870> to<00:03:53.930> this<00:03:54.260> one<00:03:54.470> so<00:03:54.709> you<00:03:54.799> can

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:54.950 
don't need to go to this one so you can

00:03:54.950 --> 00:03:56.860 
don't need to go to this one so you can
this<00:03:55.130> change<00:03:55.400> the<00:03:55.730> toggles<00:03:56.150> directly<00:03:56.660> from

00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:56.870 
this change the toggles directly from

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:01.540 
this change the toggles directly from
you<00:03:57.110> so<00:03:57.680> it<00:03:57.739> does<00:03:57.950> save<00:03:58.190> quite<00:03:58.640> a<00:03:58.700> bit<00:03:58.910> of<00:03:59.060> time

00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:01.550 

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:03.550 

and<00:04:02.240> also<00:04:02.390> you<00:04:02.630> can<00:04:02.840> actually<00:04:03.020> change<00:04:03.380> the

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:03.560 
and also you can actually change the

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.560 
and also you can actually change the
functions<00:04:04.040> of<00:04:04.190> these<00:04:04.310> capacitive<00:04:04.940> keys<00:04:05.180> so<00:04:05.450> if

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:05.570 
functions of these capacitive keys so if

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:07.330 
functions of these capacitive keys so if
you<00:04:05.900> are<00:04:05.990> using<00:04:06.200> the<00:04:06.440> capacitive<00:04:06.980> keys<00:04:07.190> you

00:04:07.330 --> 00:04:07.340 
you are using the capacitive keys you

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:10.180 
you are using the capacitive keys you
can<00:04:07.370> either<00:04:07.700> get<00:04:08.510> this<00:04:08.780> whole<00:04:09.020> round<00:04:09.710> function

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:10.190 
can either get this whole round function

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:12.940 
can either get this whole round function
to<00:04:10.400> open<00:04:10.640> up<00:04:10.940> the<00:04:11.060> reasons<00:04:11.450> menu<00:04:11.930> or<00:04:12.170> you<00:04:12.800> can

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:12.950 
to open up the reasons menu or you can

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:14.830 
to open up the reasons menu or you can
also<00:04:13.100> set<00:04:13.430> a<00:04:13.460> double<00:04:13.850> tap<00:04:14.030> action<00:04:14.450> so<00:04:14.630> on<00:04:14.750> a

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:14.840 
also set a double tap action so on a

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:16.570 
also set a double tap action so on a
double<00:04:15.110> tab<00:04:15.320> does<00:04:15.560> it<00:04:15.740> takes<00:04:15.980> me<00:04:16.160> to<00:04:16.280> Google

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:16.580 
double tab does it takes me to Google

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:18.820 
double tab does it takes me to Google
now<00:04:16.760> and<00:04:17.209> you<00:04:17.570> can<00:04:17.720> send<00:04:17.959> this<00:04:18.110> as<00:04:18.410> well<00:04:18.650> do

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:18.830 
now and you can send this as well do

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:22.060 
now and you can send this as well do
something<00:04:19.070> subset<00:04:19.730> of<00:04:19.760> this<00:04:20.030> too<00:04:20.870> so<00:04:21.770> that<00:04:21.950> it

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:22.070 
something subset of this too so that it

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:23.950 
something subset of this too so that it
switches<00:04:22.310> to<00:04:22.490> the<00:04:22.670> glass<00:04:22.970> tube<00:04:23.240> application

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:23.960 
switches to the glass tube application

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:26.380 
switches to the glass tube application
so<00:04:24.680> in<00:04:24.800> order<00:04:24.920> to<00:04:25.100> set<00:04:25.610> this<00:04:25.760> up<00:04:25.940> working<00:04:26.210> with

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:26.390 
so in order to set this up working with

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:28.180 
so in order to set this up working with
you<00:04:26.600> you<00:04:26.630> need<00:04:26.930> to<00:04:26.990> go<00:04:27.200> to<00:04:27.320> the<00:04:27.440> settings<00:04:27.800> then

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:28.190 
you you need to go to the settings then

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:31.000 
you you need to go to the settings then
you<00:04:28.340> need<00:04:28.490> to<00:04:28.640> go<00:04:28.790> to<00:04:28.900> buttons<00:04:29.900> and<00:04:30.140> then<00:04:30.740> you

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:31.010 
you need to go to buttons and then you

00:04:31.010 --> 00:04:33.700 
you need to go to buttons and then you
or<00:04:31.220> then<00:04:31.460> I'll<00:04:31.940> just<00:04:32.150> scroll<00:04:32.450> down<00:04:32.510> and<00:04:32.960> you
