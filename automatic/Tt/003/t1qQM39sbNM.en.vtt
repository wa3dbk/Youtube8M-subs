00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.360
 And about the weed 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:12.120
 It can be entered in any painting, in order 

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:20.140
 so that the elements of the composition (flowers, leaves) are connected to each other 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:23.300
 Those. looked more solid 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.560
 You can use weed to do this. 

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:33.920
 Here we have a flower with petals, buds 

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.820
 Let's start with the leaves 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:01:00.020
 The grass will begin to draw between this piece and this 

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:05.060
 Between them we have a distance 

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.620
 The place that forms the triangle 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.700
 And we will try to fit our weed into a triangle. 

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.040
 Let's start 

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:42.780
 In the same way fill the space between the two other leaves 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:16.060
 Now we will proceed to the bud, which we will tie to the composition with the help of weed 

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.860
 ... so 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:31.140
 The bud with us in this area is the center, so weed should complement it 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.840
 Underline its location 

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.720
 Getting started 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:03:01.760
 Now let's pay attention to two other buds. 

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:38.060
 Now there is a feeling that in this area we do not have enough weed 

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:57.340
 Only one unfinished area remained. Here is this place 

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:04.160
 We supplement it 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:17.400
 You can display this antenna 

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:24.280
 You can get more mustache from here 

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:29.040
 So here 

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:35.300
 We will complete our buds 

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:55.580
 And this bud ... 

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.320
 And the last bud 

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:22.640
 That way 

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:33.480
 With the help of weed, we make our composition more solid. 

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:38.200
 We add grace 

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:42.240
 Here we have such a picture, flower 

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:49.040
