00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:34.210

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:18.439
 Mada, but lawmakers are there 

00:01:15.719 --> 00:01:18.439

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:25.590
 Line ThatLookLikeThis 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:30.109
 Goro' with anti-Kokoroshite there in this field on the inside 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.109
 It will also catch as if doing so 

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:39.450
 Hey what is not able to catch myself to the other is I have been white month one 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:41.870

 To the brow 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:48.800
 harrison After all it is this Harris part 

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:51.680
 This sentence is Harris 

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:54.760
 This Harris is visible to the fish 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:59.640
 I can't see it this way 

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:59.640
 This is the transparency of the water of the day 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:06.670
 It is if there various 

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:09.289
 So this Harris 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:11.640
 I'd have to'd end visible to fish 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:15.069
 I mean fish 

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:18.140
 You do not fool even the fish by such of but leaves 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:21.040
 Well then let's go through the cuticle 

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.040
 Another trick 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:27.160
 So you don't need to use only one piece but two or three pieces 

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:30.690
 Have different types 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:34.270
 That's a good list 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:39.610
 It would be nice that there are many 

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:42.520
 It is to do is not aligned with the needle even in the lowest 23 types of 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:44.450
 Is better to losing star only 

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:47.530
 Well in the say 

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:49.750
 So also have caught the fish in Vibe 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.860
 Please enjoy 

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:56.320
