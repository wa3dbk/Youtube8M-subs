family<00:00:21.689> college<00:00:22.170> let's<00:00:22.710> see<00:00:22.830> what<00:00:22.920> this<00:00:22.980> thing

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:23.160 
family college let's see what this thing

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.460 
family college let's see what this thing
can<00:00:23.279> do<00:00:26.420> so<00:00:27.420> the<00:00:27.539> i3<00:00:27.810> doesn't<00:00:28.080> really<00:00:28.230> have<00:00:28.439> the

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:28.470 
can do so the i3 doesn't really have the

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:31.640 
can do so the i3 doesn't really have the
pickup<00:00:28.920> of<00:00:29.480> $100,000<00:00:30.480> Tesla<00:00:31.050> Model<00:00:31.170> S<00:00:31.470> but

pickup of $100,000 Tesla Model S but

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:32.930 
pickup of $100,000 Tesla Model S but
then<00:00:31.769> again<00:00:32.009> this<00:00:32.189> car<00:00:32.399> starts<00:00:32.730> around

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:32.940 
then again this car starts around

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.840 
then again this car starts around
$40,000<00:00:33.870> so<00:00:34.649> all<00:00:34.739> things<00:00:34.920> considered<00:00:35.130> it's

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:35.850 
$40,000 so all things considered it's

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.959 
$40,000 so all things considered it's
pretty<00:00:36.090> quick<00:00:36.420> as<00:00:37.140> a<00:00:37.200> lot<00:00:37.410> of<00:00:37.530> EVs<00:00:37.860> are<00:00:38.040> the

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
pretty quick as a lot of EVs are the

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.729 
pretty quick as a lot of EVs are the
interior<00:00:39.480> is<00:00:39.540> really<00:00:39.600> unique<00:00:40.200> if<00:00:40.440> you've<00:00:40.590> ever

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:40.739 
interior is really unique if you've ever

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:43.369 
interior is really unique if you've ever
been<00:00:40.920> in<00:00:41.070> a<00:00:41.129> BMW<00:00:41.370> don't<00:00:42.329> expect<00:00:42.780> this<00:00:42.960> to<00:00:43.020> feel

00:00:43.369 --> 00:00:43.379 
been in a BMW don't expect this to feel

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:45.490 
been in a BMW don't expect this to feel
familiar<00:00:43.620> they<00:00:44.430> have<00:00:44.579> this<00:00:44.760> really<00:00:44.969> cool

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:45.500 
familiar they have this really cool

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.229 
familiar they have this really cool

exposed fiber accents that kind of

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:55.250 
exposed fiber accents that kind of
indicate<00:00:54.329> that<00:00:54.480> the<00:00:54.600> car<00:00:54.780> is<00:00:54.870> like<00:00:55.020> very

and<00:01:42.900> then<00:01:43.050> there's<00:01:43.200> also<00:01:43.410> an<00:01:43.860> electric<00:01:44.310> with<00:01:44.490> a

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
and then there's also an electric with a

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.060 
and then there's also an electric with a
range<00:01:45.060> extender<00:01:45.270> engine<00:01:46.260> in<00:01:46.380> it<00:01:46.500> and<00:01:46.800> it's

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
range extender engine in it and it's

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.910 
range extender engine in it and it's
just<00:01:47.250> a<00:01:47.340> little<00:01:47.490> tiny<00:01:47.880> 2<00:01:48.780> cylinder<00:01:49.260> engine<00:01:49.710> and

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:49.920 
just a little tiny 2 cylinder engine and

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:53.060 
just a little tiny 2 cylinder engine and
it's<00:01:50.070> only<00:01:50.250> job<00:01:50.700> is<00:01:51.450> to<00:01:51.870> keep<00:01:52.470> the<00:01:52.710> battery

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
it's only job is to keep the battery

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.520 
it's only job is to keep the battery
charged<00:01:53.550> enough<00:01:53.850> to<00:01:54.660> allow<00:01:54.840> the<00:01:54.900> electric

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:55.530 
charged enough to allow the electric

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:57.860 
charged enough to allow the electric
motors<00:01:55.830> to<00:01:55.860> run<00:01:56.160> any<00:01:56.550> time<00:01:56.970> that<00:01:57.270> you<00:01:57.390> need<00:01:57.420> to

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:57.870 
motors to run any time that you need to

00:01:57.870 --> 00:02:00.380 
motors to run any time that you need to
go<00:01:58.110> you<00:01:58.440> can<00:01:58.650> just<00:01:58.950> put<00:01:59.520> des<00:01:59.730> in<00:01:59.940> the<00:02:00.030> tank<00:02:00.240> we

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:00.390 
go you can just put des in the tank we

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:02.420 
go you can just put des in the tank we
have<00:02:00.510> about<00:02:00.690> a<00:02:00.750> hundred<00:02:00.930> miles<00:02:01.260> even<00:02:02.250> if<00:02:02.340> you

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
have about a hundred miles even if you

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.340 
have about a hundred miles even if you
have<00:02:02.550> nothing<00:02:02.760> in<00:02:02.940> the<00:02:03.060> battery<00:02:03.390> whereas<00:02:04.200> with

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:04.350 
have nothing in the battery whereas with

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.720 
have nothing in the battery whereas with
the<00:02:04.440> all-electric<00:02:04.680> version<00:02:05.130> is<00:02:05.400> just<00:02:05.610> like

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:05.730 
the all-electric version is just like

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:07.100 
the all-electric version is just like
any<00:02:05.880> other<00:02:06.000> easy<00:02:06.270> you've<00:02:06.510> got<00:02:06.660> to<00:02:06.780> charge<00:02:06.990> it

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.110 
any other easy you've got to charge it
