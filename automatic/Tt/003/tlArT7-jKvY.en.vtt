00:01:10.389 --> 00:01:10.399 
hundred percent from the left if you

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:14.410 
hundred percent from the left if you
look<00:01:10.610> at<00:01:10.759> the<00:01:10.940> curriculum<00:01:11.509> it's<00:01:12.140> all<00:01:12.850> being<00:01:13.850> to

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:14.420 
look at the curriculum it's all being to

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.510 
look at the curriculum it's all being to
be<00:01:14.509> taught<00:01:14.750> by<00:01:14.930> leftist<00:01:15.440> but<00:01:16.040> if<00:01:16.130> you<00:01:16.220> look<00:01:16.399> at

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:16.520 
be taught by leftist but if you look at

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.279 
be taught by leftist but if you look at
the<00:01:16.550> text<00:01:17.030> that<00:01:17.210> they<00:01:17.360> assign<00:01:17.750> though<00:01:18.020> they're

00:01:18.279 --> 00:01:18.289 
the text that they assign though they're

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:20.170 
the text that they assign though they're
also<00:01:18.440> mainly<00:01:19.220> going<00:01:19.430> to<00:01:19.550> be<00:01:19.670> from<00:01:19.820> the<00:01:19.940> left

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:20.180 
also mainly going to be from the left

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:23.080 
also mainly going to be from the left
and<00:01:20.300> now<00:01:20.479> I'm<00:01:20.630> speaking<00:01:21.310> pretty<00:01:22.310> narrowly<00:01:22.789> of

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.090 
and now I'm speaking pretty narrowly of

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.660 
and now I'm speaking pretty narrowly of
the<00:01:23.440> departments<00:01:24.440> that<00:01:24.500> generally<00:01:25.160> deal<00:01:25.369> with

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:25.670 
the departments that generally deal with

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:27.820 
the departments that generally deal with
issues<00:01:25.899> for<00:01:26.899> example<00:01:26.960> like<00:01:27.320> the<00:01:27.440> Middle<00:01:27.680> East

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:27.830 
issues for example like the Middle East

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:31.090 
issues for example like the Middle East
conflict<00:01:28.210> so<00:01:29.210> if<00:01:29.720> the<00:01:30.380> students<00:01:30.830> at<00:01:30.950> this

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100 
conflict so if the students at this

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.480 
conflict so if the students at this
campus<00:01:31.580> will<00:01:31.880> form<00:01:32.270> a<00:01:32.450> movement<00:01:32.990> for<00:01:33.490> academic

00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:34.490 
campus will form a movement for academic

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.430 
campus will form a movement for academic
freedom<00:01:34.880> and<00:01:35.060> intellectual<00:01:35.600> diversity<00:01:35.750> and

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:36.440 
freedom and intellectual diversity and

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.390 
freedom and intellectual diversity and
nearly<00:01:36.680> demand<00:01:37.250> of<00:01:39.040> representation<00:01:40.040> or<00:01:40.159> the

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:40.400 
nearly demand of representation or the

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.050 
nearly demand of representation or the
left<00:01:40.610> is<00:01:40.880> very<00:01:41.119> good<00:01:41.330> at<00:01:41.450> politics<00:01:41.869> these<00:01:42.740> are

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:43.060 
left is very good at politics these are

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.230 
left is very good at politics these are
underrepresented<00:01:44.060> views<00:01:45.760> they<00:01:46.760> need<00:01:46.970> to<00:01:47.090> be

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
underrepresented views they need to be

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.690 
underrepresented views they need to be
many<00:01:47.960> many<00:01:48.200> more<00:01:48.500> speakers<00:01:49.130> it<00:01:49.280> needs<00:01:49.430> to<00:01:49.580> be

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700 
many many more speakers it needs to be

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.090 
many many more speakers it needs to be
parity<00:01:50.210> between<00:01:50.810> speakers<00:01:51.290> from<00:01:51.680> the<00:01:51.860> left

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:52.100 
parity between speakers from the left

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.060 
parity between speakers from the left
and<00:01:52.340> the<00:01:52.369> right<00:01:52.430> on<00:01:53.259> highly<00:01:54.259> volatile<00:01:54.710> issues

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:55.070 
and the right on highly volatile issues

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:57.940 
and the right on highly volatile issues
like<00:01:55.880> the<00:01:56.030> Middle<00:01:56.270> East<00:01:56.420> crisis<00:01:56.900> they<00:01:57.560> need<00:01:57.799> to

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:57.950 
like the Middle East crisis they need to

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:01.899 
like the Middle East crisis they need to
be<00:01:58.100> books<00:01:58.430> in<00:01:58.700> the<00:01:58.820> classroom<00:01:59.439> of<00:02:00.729> critics<00:02:01.729> of

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:01.909 
be books in the classroom of critics of

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:05.230 
be books in the classroom of critics of
the<00:02:02.030> left<00:02:02.270> as<00:02:02.540> well<00:02:02.780> as<00:02:02.960> just<00:02:03.560> leftist<00:02:04.240> and

00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:05.240 
the left as well as just leftist and

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.120 
the left as well as just leftist and
then<00:02:05.570> in<00:02:05.810> my<00:02:05.990> view<00:02:06.290> there<00:02:06.500> should<00:02:06.740> be<00:02:06.890> some

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130 
then in my view there should be some

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:08.770 
then in my view there should be some
effort<00:02:07.490> made<00:02:07.700> to<00:02:07.729> invite<00:02:08.299> visiting

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
effort made to invite visiting

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.140 
effort made to invite visiting
