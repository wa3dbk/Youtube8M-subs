00:00:09.769 --> 00:00:16.750
 hello how are you in this design work 

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:20.720
 sculptural and I'm using these 

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:23.750
 forms of the crystal neus brand that yes 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:25.640
 they came out very good quality but take yourself 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.710
 a little bit to accommodate them because I'm 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.439
 accustomed to a larger form 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:32.480
 I have fingers that are also very large and 

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:35.360
 size a little at the beginning but the 

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:37.690
 Quality is good and good in this video 

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:40.340
 bouncing me the steps of preparation 

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:43.100
 I apply prime eddie start extending the 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:46.220
 acrylic of the center of the nail or of the 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:49.700
 that is going to be the nail would be the tip of the 

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:51.740
 natural nail down 

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:54.620
 and since I already extend everything I can 

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:58.970
 allows and I'm giving the form and then 

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:01.710
 I already worry about the cuticle area 

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:06.330
 where is the cuticle 

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:10.560
 on my little finger apply a touch of 

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:13.470
 glee and this is because it will be the only nail 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:15.180
 all it will not be so precious stones 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.180
 he wanted to put one anyway 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:21.300
 accent so that it would not be left alone 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.040
 gray if you want to get this 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:26.369
 acrylic tone at the end I'm going to 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.570
 leave a little quick tutorial of 

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:31.750
 how to make this mixture 

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:34.030
 and I want you to please do not know 

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:37.380
 worry about the materials you used 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:39.940
 do not see the marks that I use 

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:43.420
 look for the tones and if you are going to see that they are 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:46.690
 you be able to replicate the mixture 

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:50.140
 example if I use a gray it does not matter 

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:53.080
 what brand is you use a gray the 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:55.750
 that you have the one that looks like and is going to 

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:58.420
 leave the mixture similar between more 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:02:00.820
 seemed the products more similar 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:03.690
 it's going to be the mix but if you do not have the 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:06.460
 tone of gray that I have of silver 

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:09.750
 try to do it with another one sometimes they are 

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:12.480
 very strong tones we can lower them 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:15.060
 and try not to focus on the products 

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.510
 focus on how to prepare the 

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.510
 mixture 

00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:23.700
 here always this step before it 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:27.580
 cool the acrylic I give it a 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:29.090
 prick so it is tight 

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.989
 if he did not explain 

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:35.870
 and this is the curvita that you also give 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:38.750
 it has to be warm that is 

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.940
 drying and well here I jumped 

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:43.640
 filing steps obviously there was filing and 

00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:47.480
 polished in this set but to cut 

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:51.019
 time elimines already know how to fine your 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:53.209
 nails and flat I will use pearls and 

00:02:51.019 --> 00:02:58.069
 pebbles of different shades in pink 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:03:01.310
 crystal red I do not care about the size 

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:03.920
 in this set if I left without rules if 

00:03:01.310 --> 00:03:08.329
 the little one was up or the big one 

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:12.049
 down did not interest me the truth there was no 

00:03:08.329 --> 00:03:16.940
 a pattern to say in this nor a design 

00:03:12.049 --> 00:03:19.010
 with one carrying a flow rate sometimes 

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:22.030
 the less we break our heads 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:24.400
 I feel that it is in the most beautiful things 

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:27.720
 and if I liked it, this is what I 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.720
 I wanted to reflect exactly 

00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:35.540
 you hit this design shines a lot has a 

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:38.780
 very impressive shine the stones are 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:41.960
 swaroski all and then when I 

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:45.860
 I'm in the sun in the hands they look 

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:48.560
 seem of light is perfect for what 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:52.600
 that I needed the tones are also 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:56.060
 I do not usually use tones 

00:03:52.600 --> 00:04:00.100
 claritos very often so it came out a 

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:02.710
 little of my comfort zone and I liked it 

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:05.920
 but good many thanks for watching the 

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:10.150
 video do not forget to share it subscribe 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:11.890
 at the end after the photos I leave you 

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:15.020
 the tutorial for those who are 

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:18.290
 interested in how to make this tone 

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:19.520
 I am me and until next time with another 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:21.640
 video 

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:21.640
 bye 

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:48.260
 cuticle pusher for my measurement 

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:50.990
 I'm going to use one of minerals to see 

00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:52.880
 which is supposed to be a silver of the 

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:56.120
 Super neo brand but rather it is a gray 

00:04:52.880 --> 00:05:01.380
 the rio de janeiro de easy flow which is a 

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:04.320
 Translucent pink conclude nothing more 

00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:07.340
 and that uses two three pushers 

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:10.350
 crystal acrylic pushers 

00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:13.590
 you can also use pure acrylic 

00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:16.020
 Translucent pink to reduce already 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:18.030
 you will get a more violet color 2 

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:21.210
 this is optional you do not have to lose the 

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:24.630
 mixture is very beautiful remember that 

00:05:21.210 --> 00:05:26.520
 the more layers the more opaque it becomes 

00:05:24.630 --> 00:05:29.250
 all because I wish you luck doing the 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:31.500
 mix and remember do not focus on the 

00:05:29.250 --> 00:05:35.390
 brand of materials like what else you 

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:35.390
 it seems like a hug
