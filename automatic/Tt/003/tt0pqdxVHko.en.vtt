if you'd like the old-school design of
the<00:00:55.140> mark<00:00:55.350> ii<00:00:55.559> because<00:00:55.860> this<00:00:56.070> is<00:00:56.220> just<00:00:56.340> a

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
the mark ii because this is just a

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.580 
the mark ii because this is just a
fantastic<00:00:56.879> take<00:00:57.300> on<00:00:57.510> it<00:00:57.660> starting<00:00:58.410> with<00:00:58.530> the

00:00:58.580 --> 00:00:58.590 
fantastic take on it starting with the

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:00.260 
fantastic take on it starting with the
color<00:00:58.770> is<00:00:58.920> the<00:00:59.070> two<00:00:59.250> shades<00:00:59.550> of<00:00:59.670> grey<00:00:59.910> from<00:01:00.210> a

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
color is the two shades of grey from a

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.790 
color is the two shades of grey from a
distance<00:01:00.600> you<00:01:00.690> hardly<00:01:01.020> even<00:01:01.140> notice<00:01:01.530> them<00:01:01.710> but

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:01.800 
distance you hardly even notice them but

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:03.110 
distance you hardly even notice them but
once<00:01:02.010> you<00:01:02.129> get<00:01:02.220> up<00:01:02.340> close<00:01:02.550> you<00:01:02.580> really

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.120 
once you get up close you really

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.670 
once you get up close you really
appreciate<00:01:03.330> that<00:01:03.720> differentiation<00:01:04.350> there

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:04.680 
appreciate that differentiation there

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.620 
appreciate that differentiation there
but<00:01:05.430> it's<00:01:05.550> more<00:01:05.729> in<00:01:05.910> keeping<00:01:06.060> with<00:01:06.300> the<00:01:06.479> old

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
but it's more in keeping with the old

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.200 
but it's more in keeping with the old
classic<00:01:07.110> in<00:01:07.200> the<00:01:07.290> rx-78<00:01:07.890> too<00:01:08.340> and<00:01:08.520> just<00:01:08.729> adding

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
classic in the rx-78 too and just adding

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.400 
classic in the rx-78 too and just adding
to<00:01:09.390> it<00:01:09.510> and<00:01:09.630> getting<00:01:09.840> that<00:01:09.930> a<00:01:09.990> little<00:01:10.200> bit<00:01:10.320> of

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:10.410 
to it and getting that a little bit of

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:12.260 
to it and getting that a little bit of
extra<00:01:10.650> color<00:01:10.830> in<00:01:11.040> there<00:01:11.190> despite<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:12.090> fact

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
extra color in there despite the fact

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.670 
extra color in there despite the fact
that<00:01:12.330> it's<00:01:12.509> actually<00:01:12.630> not<00:01:12.930> as<00:01:13.110> colorful<00:01:13.560> with

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:13.680

00:01:50.839 --> 00:01:50.849 
grades for the way they look sometimes

00:01:50.849 --> 00:01:52.219

line in terms of mobility the legs can
kick<00:02:01.649> forward<00:02:02.009> you<00:02:02.099> can<00:02:02.250> fill<00:02:02.399> around<00:02:02.550> with

00:02:02.779 --> 00:02:02.789 
kick forward you can fill around with

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:04.160 
kick forward you can fill around with
the<00:02:02.849> hips<00:02:03.030> there<00:02:03.209> if<00:02:03.360> you<00:02:03.450> choose<00:02:03.720> to<00:02:03.959> and

the hips there if you choose to and
you're<00:02:04.560> going<00:02:04.679> to<00:02:04.709> get<00:02:04.860> a<00:02:04.890> nice<00:02:05.099> knee<00:02:05.429> bend

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:05.670 
you're going to get a nice knee bend

you're going to get a nice knee bend
there<00:02:05.849> you<00:02:06.000> can<00:02:06.149> see<00:02:06.270> that<00:02:06.390> you're<00:02:06.479> going<00:02:06.599> to

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
there you can see that you're going to

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.809 
there you can see that you're going to
get<00:02:06.720> the<00:02:06.869> thigh<00:02:07.050> split<00:02:07.470> and<00:02:07.679> the<00:02:08.160> ankle<00:02:08.459> itself

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:10.010 
get the thigh split and the ankle itself
it<00:02:09.000> remember<00:02:09.330> the<00:02:09.420> foot<00:02:09.599> is<00:02:09.690> going<00:02:09.840> to<00:02:09.899> move

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
it remember the foot is going to move

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.690 
it remember the foot is going to move
all<00:02:10.170> the<00:02:10.289> way<00:02:10.319> down<00:02:10.560> and<00:02:10.830> the<00:02:11.220> ankle<00:02:11.520> is<00:02:11.670> not

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
all the way down and the ankle is not

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.000 
all the way down and the ankle is not
going<00:02:12.060> to<00:02:12.120> move<00:02:12.270> all<00:02:12.510> that<00:02:12.780> much<00:02:12.840> but<00:02:13.770> it<00:02:13.860> will

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
going to move all that much but it will

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.580 
going to move all that much but it will
move<00:02:14.220> well<00:02:14.520> off<00:02:14.790> to<00:02:15.180> the<00:02:15.300> side<00:02:15.569> if<00:02:15.900> you<00:02:16.380> want<00:02:16.470> to

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:16.590 
move well off to the side if you want to

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:18.770 
move well off to the side if you want to
go<00:02:16.680> for<00:02:16.860> the<00:02:16.920> full<00:02:17.130> splits<00:02:17.580> that's<00:02:17.880> also<00:02:18.480> going

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
go for the full splits that's also going

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.770 
go for the full splits that's also going
to<00:02:18.870> be<00:02:19.230> how<00:02:19.739> possible<00:02:20.340> almost<00:02:20.970> completely

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:21.780 
to be how possible almost completely

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:23.600 
to be how possible almost completely
possible<00:02:21.959> and<00:02:22.380> by<00:02:22.470> almost<00:02:22.920> I<00:02:23.040> mean<00:02:23.069> completely

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:23.610 
possible and by almost I mean completely

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:25.850 
possible and by almost I mean completely
the<00:02:24.540> upper<00:02:24.810> body<00:02:24.959> is<00:02:25.110> going<00:02:25.230> to<00:02:25.290> move<00:02:25.380> a<00:02:25.530> lot

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:25.860 
the upper body is going to move a lot

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:27.800 
the upper body is going to move a lot
and<00:02:26.160> sometimes<00:02:26.370> I<00:02:26.640> can<00:02:26.790> almost<00:02:27.030> seem<00:02:27.209> like<00:02:27.239> too

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
and sometimes I can almost seem like too

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:29.180 
and sometimes I can almost seem like too
much<00:02:28.110> there<00:02:28.349> you<00:02:28.380> can<00:02:28.620> just<00:02:28.709> see<00:02:28.830> that<00:02:29.069> this

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:29.190 
much there you can just see that this

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.190 
much there you can just see that this
really<00:02:29.459> feels<00:02:29.910> loose<00:02:30.330> as<00:02:30.660> it's<00:02:30.840> just<00:02:31.020> going<00:02:31.140> to

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:31.200 
really feels loose as it's just going to

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.050 
really feels loose as it's just going to
be<00:02:31.290> attached<00:02:31.560> on<00:02:31.800> this<00:02:32.400> gray<00:02:32.670> part<00:02:32.910> is

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
be attached on this gray part is

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.460 
be attached on this gray part is
actually<00:02:33.209> completely<00:02:33.840> loose<00:02:34.050> just<00:02:34.319> held

00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:34.470 
actually completely loose just held

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:35.930 
actually completely loose just held
together<00:02:34.560> there<00:02:34.890> by<00:02:35.099> the<00:02:35.160> chest<00:02:35.550> in<00:02:35.670> the<00:02:35.700> waist

together there by the chest in the waist

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:37.850 
together there by the chest in the waist
section<00:02:36.390> but<00:02:36.930> still<00:02:37.140> pretty<00:02:37.290> impressive<00:02:37.650> that

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
section but still pretty impressive that

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:40.010 
section but still pretty impressive that
he<00:02:37.920> can<00:02:38.069> look<00:02:38.190> that<00:02:38.370> far<00:02:38.640> down<00:02:38.849> and<00:02:39.150> that<00:02:39.750> far

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:40.020 
he can look that far down and that far

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:42.050 
he can look that far down and that far
up<00:02:40.200> in<00:02:40.349> the<00:02:40.380> air<00:02:40.620> in<00:02:41.130> terms<00:02:41.520> of<00:02:41.670> the<00:02:41.730> shoulders

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:43.140 
themselves you can see that they can

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:45.020 
themselves you can see that they can
separate<00:02:43.680> there<00:02:43.830> from<00:02:44.010> that<00:02:44.160> gray<00:02:44.459> part<00:02:44.790> or

the right and you can see that he's

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:45.340 
the right and you can see that he's
going<00:04:44.510> to<00:04:44.570> be<00:04:44.690> a<00:04:44.720> little<00:04:44.900> bit<00:04:45.050> shorter

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:45.350 
going to be a little bit shorter

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:46.750 
going to be a little bit shorter
although<00:04:45.620> the<00:04:45.740> legs<00:04:45.950> or<00:04:46.190> may<00:04:46.400> not<00:04:46.610> necessarily

be<00:04:47.360> the<00:04:47.540> best<00:04:47.570> position<00:04:48.230> just<00:04:49.010> because<00:04:49.250> he's

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:49.370 
be the best position just because he's

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:50.620 
be the best position just because he's
got<00:04:49.520> that<00:04:49.670> extra<00:04:49.910> weight<00:04:50.060> to<00:04:50.210> deal<00:04:50.330> with<00:04:50.510> on

whereas<00:05:06.470> back<00:05:06.680> in<00:05:06.890> the<00:05:06.950> day<00:05:07.100> in<00:05:07.280> the<00:05:07.370> mid<00:05:07.550> 80s

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:07.910 
whereas back in the day in the mid 80s

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:09.850 
whereas back in the day in the mid 80s
this<00:05:08.180> is<00:05:08.240> how<00:05:08.510> condoms<00:05:08.870> were<00:05:08.990> done<00:05:09.170> and<00:05:09.410> that

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:09.860 
this is how condoms were done and that

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:11.560 
this is how condoms were done and that
big<00:05:10.100> blocky<00:05:10.400> look<00:05:10.730> is<00:05:10.880> going<00:05:11.030> to<00:05:11.090> look<00:05:11.240> great

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:11.570 
big blocky look is going to look great

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:14.590 
big blocky look is going to look great
whether<00:05:11.990> it's<00:05:12.200> back<00:05:12.380> then<00:05:12.680> or<00:05:12.980> here<00:05:13.610> in<00:05:13.760> 2012

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:14.600 
whether it's back then or here in 2012

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:17.050 
whether it's back then or here in 2012
I'd<00:05:14.810> say<00:05:15.080> but<00:05:16.070> even<00:05:16.280> if<00:05:16.370> he<00:05:16.460> looks<00:05:16.640> tall<00:05:16.820> next

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:17.060 
I'd say but even if he looks tall next

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:19.990 
I'd say but even if he looks tall next
to<00:05:17.240> most<00:05:17.420> leads<00:05:18.220> next<00:05:19.220> to<00:05:19.280> the<00:05:19.400> destroy<00:05:19.730> mode

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:20.000 
to most leads next to the destroy mode

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:21.610 
to most leads next to the destroy mode
of<00:05:20.210> the<00:05:20.300> Banshee<00:05:20.720> or<00:05:20.840> the<00:05:20.960> unicorn<00:05:21.380> you<00:05:21.470> can

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:21.620 
of the Banshee or the unicorn you can

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:22.720 
of the Banshee or the unicorn you can
see<00:05:21.740> that<00:05:21.860> he's<00:05:21.950> still<00:05:22.100> going<00:05:22.220> to<00:05:22.280> be<00:05:22.370> a<00:05:22.400> lot

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:22.730 
see that he's still going to be a lot

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:25.330 
see that he's still going to be a lot
smaller<00:05:23.030> and<00:05:23.720> he's<00:05:24.080> going<00:05:24.380> to<00:05:24.470> look<00:05:24.650> not<00:05:25.040> quite

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:25.340 
smaller and he's going to look not quite

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:26.860 
smaller and he's going to look not quite
as<00:05:25.490> detailed<00:05:25.700> I<00:05:26.060> mean<00:05:26.240> just<00:05:26.510> in<00:05:26.570> comparison

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:26.870 
as detailed I mean just in comparison

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:28.690 
as detailed I mean just in comparison
from<00:05:27.590> the<00:05:27.740> distance<00:05:28.070> you<00:05:28.160> probably<00:05:28.400> say<00:05:28.550> this

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:28.700 
from the distance you probably say this

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:30.100 
from the distance you probably say this
guy<00:05:28.850> has<00:05:28.880> more<00:05:29.120> details<00:05:29.450> until<00:05:29.630> you<00:05:29.840> actually

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:30.110 
guy has more details until you actually

00:05:30.110 --> 00:05:31.900 
guy has more details until you actually
get<00:05:30.230> up<00:05:30.260> close<00:05:30.620> and<00:05:30.830> it<00:05:31.340> just<00:05:31.550> sort<00:05:31.700> of<00:05:31.730> makes

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:31.910 
get up close and it just sort of makes

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:33.790 
get up close and it just sort of makes
me<00:05:32.030> think<00:05:32.060> we've<00:05:32.450> seen<00:05:32.600> the<00:05:32.870> grunts<00:05:33.560> have<00:05:33.650> been

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:33.800 
me think we've seen the grunts have been

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:35.710 
me think we've seen the grunts have been
very<00:05:34.040> very<00:05:34.310> well<00:05:34.550> represented<00:05:34.760> in<00:05:35.240> unicorn

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:35.720 
very very well represented in unicorn

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:37.780 
very very well represented in unicorn
but<00:05:36.320> yeah<00:05:36.770> would<00:05:36.950> that<00:05:37.070> be<00:05:37.220> pretty<00:05:37.340> silly<00:05:37.640> if

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:37.790 
but yeah would that be pretty silly if

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:39.190 
but yeah would that be pretty silly if
they<00:05:37.880> had<00:05:38.000> a<00:05:38.030> double<00:05:38.330> Zeta<00:05:38.540> Gundam<00:05:38.750> team

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:39.200 
they had a double Zeta Gundam team

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:40.960 
they had a double Zeta Gundam team
running<00:05:39.530> around<00:05:39.620> in<00:05:39.920> the<00:05:39.980> background<00:05:40.160> I<00:05:40.520> think

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:40.970 
running around in the background I think

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:42.990 
running around in the background I think
that<00:05:41.090> could<00:05:41.270> be<00:05:41.300> sort<00:05:41.690> of<00:05:41.780> fun<00:05:41.960> actually<00:05:42.140> and

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:43.000
