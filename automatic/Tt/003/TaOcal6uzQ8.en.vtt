your<00:01:04.110> helicopter<00:01:04.769> could<00:01:04.949> spin<00:01:05.189> around<00:01:05.280> in

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
your helicopter could spin around in

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.390 
your helicopter could spin around in
circles<00:01:06.170> so<00:01:07.170> make<00:01:07.380> sure<00:01:07.409> that's<00:01:07.770> about<00:01:08.100> half

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
circles so make sure that's about half

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.200 
circles so make sure that's about half
way<00:01:08.729> and<00:01:09.510> if<00:01:10.170> the<00:01:10.320> tail<00:01:10.590> starts<00:01:10.979> wagging<00:01:11.210> just

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
way and if the tail starts wagging just

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:15.620 
way and if the tail starts wagging just
back<00:01:13.140> this<00:01:13.409> down<00:01:14.060> if<00:01:15.060> your<00:01:15.240> tail<00:01:15.479> is<00:01:15.600> not

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
back this down if your tail is not

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:19.240 
back this down if your tail is not
wagging<00:01:16.430> turn<00:01:17.430> this<00:01:17.610> up<00:01:17.880> until<00:01:18.210> the<00:01:18.330> tail<00:01:18.570> wags

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:19.250 
wagging turn this up until the tail wags

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.690 
wagging turn this up until the tail wags
then<00:01:20.250> turn<00:01:20.700> that<00:01:20.729> down<00:01:21.270> until<00:01:21.659> it<00:01:21.780> stops<00:01:22.700> this

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:23.700 
then turn that down until it stops this

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:27.410 
then turn that down until it stops this
knob<00:01:24.090> here<00:01:24.170> is<00:01:25.170> your<00:01:25.380> hover<00:01:25.590> pitch<00:01:25.920> knob<00:01:26.420> this

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420 
knob here is your hover pitch knob this

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:28.880 
knob here is your hover pitch knob this
will<00:01:27.600> give<00:01:27.750> you<00:01:27.869> more<00:01:27.900> or<00:01:28.320> less<00:01:28.500> positive

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:28.890 
will give you more or less positive

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.660 
will give you more or less positive
pitch<00:01:29.460> if<00:01:29.939> you<00:01:30.689> want<00:01:30.900> to<00:01:30.960> land<00:01:31.170> soft<00:01:31.590> fur<00:01:31.799> you

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:32.670 
pitch if you want to land soft fur you

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:35.600 
pitch if you want to land soft fur you
can<00:01:32.850> turn<00:01:33.119> this<00:01:33.329> up<00:01:33.600> a<00:01:33.689> bit<00:01:33.930> and<00:01:34.430> that<00:01:35.430> would

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
can turn this up a bit and that would

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:37.219 
can turn this up a bit and that would
give<00:01:35.850> you<00:01:35.970> more<00:01:36.150> positive<00:01:36.659> pitch<00:01:36.869> when<00:01:37.079> you're

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:37.229 
give you more positive pitch when you're

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.350 
give you more positive pitch when you're
landing<00:01:37.939> so<00:01:38.939> make<00:01:39.509> sure<00:01:39.540> this<00:01:39.900> switches<00:01:40.409> back

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360 
landing so make sure this switches back

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:47.210 
landing so make sure this switches back
this<00:01:42.360> switches<00:01:42.869> back<00:01:44.630> this<00:01:45.630> knob<00:01:45.990> is<00:01:46.259> down<00:01:46.560> all

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
this switches back this knob is down all

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.990 
this switches back this knob is down all
the<00:01:47.460> way<00:01:47.610> so<00:01:48.950> there's<00:01:49.950> a<00:01:50.009> throttle<00:01:50.520> trim<00:01:50.790> knob

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:51.000 
the way so there's a throttle trim knob

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.020 
the way so there's a throttle trim knob
there's<00:01:51.299> also<00:01:51.509> all<00:01:51.990> the<00:01:52.079> way<00:01:52.170> down<00:01:52.409> like<00:01:53.030> this

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
there's also all the way down like this

00:01:54.030 --> 00:02:04.270 
there's also all the way down like this
all<00:01:54.869> your<00:01:55.140> trim<00:01:55.470> centered

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:04.280 

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:12.050 

then<00:02:05.280> turn<00:02:05.579> it<00:02:05.729> on<00:02:05.880> you<00:02:06.149> really<00:02:06.450> go<00:02:10.790> make<00:02:11.790> sure

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:12.060 
then turn it on you really go make sure

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:15.580 
then turn it on you really go make sure

plug the helicopter up you won't start

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.030 
plug the helicopter up you won't start
it<00:02:26.160> shouldn't<00:02:26.549> start<00:02:27.470> if<00:02:28.470> it<00:02:28.560> does<00:02:28.769> you<00:02:29.010> can

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
it shouldn't start if it does you can

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.280 
it shouldn't start if it does you can
get<00:02:29.250> in<00:02:29.370> trouble<00:02:31.069> make<00:02:32.069> sure<00:02:32.310> your<00:02:32.519> gyro<00:02:33.290> light
