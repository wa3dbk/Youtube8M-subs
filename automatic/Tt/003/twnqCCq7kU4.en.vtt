00:01:51.949 --> 00:01:51.959 
here yeah its water at redstone in a

00:01:51.959 --> 00:01:56.210 
here yeah its water at redstone in a
pretty<00:01:52.679> tight<00:01:52.830> area<00:01:53.670> I<00:01:53.940> believe<00:01:54.720> it's<00:01:54.869> 14<00:01:55.410> x<00:01:55.619> 19

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:56.220 
pretty tight area I believe it's 14 x 19

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.949 
pretty tight area I believe it's 14 x 19
by<00:01:56.520> 11<00:01:57.209> yeah<00:01:58.140> I<00:01:58.170> believe<00:01:58.259> so<00:01:58.530> ah<00:01:59.420> so<00:02:00.420> right

by 11 yeah I believe so ah so right
there<00:02:01.619> this<00:02:02.459> wire<00:02:02.819> right<00:02:03.209> here<00:02:03.270> that<00:02:03.660> I'm

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:03.780 
there this wire right here that I'm

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:05.719 
there this wire right here that I'm
standing<00:02:04.229> on<00:02:04.410> that<00:02:04.440> comes<00:02:05.009> from<00:02:05.280> the<00:02:05.490> button

00:02:05.719 --> 00:02:05.729 
standing on that comes from the button

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:11.600 
standing on that comes from the button
that<00:02:06.030> goes<00:02:06.390> in<00:02:07.880> God<00:02:08.880> that<00:02:09.830> that<00:02:10.830> actually<00:02:11.099> goes

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:11.610 
that goes in God that that actually goes

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:14.870 
that goes in God that that actually goes
with<00:02:11.880> the<00:02:12.150> Pistons<00:02:12.870> to<00:02:13.230> open<00:02:13.650> the<00:02:13.739> door<00:02:14.099> that

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
with the Pistons to open the door that

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.960 
with the Pistons to open the door that
goes<00:02:14.910> down<00:02:15.390> below<00:02:15.780> and<00:02:16.020> under<00:02:16.349> there<00:02:16.530> and<00:02:16.970> then

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:17.970 
goes down below and under there and then

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:21.520 
goes down below and under there and then
the<00:02:18.239> other<00:02:18.270> button<00:02:19.020> which<00:02:19.440> is<00:02:19.680> right<00:02:20.610> there

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:21.530 
the other button which is right there

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:26.750 
the other button which is right there
and<00:02:23.239> there<00:02:24.239> are<00:02:25.230> you<00:02:25.410> hit<00:02:25.590> those<00:02:25.800> then<00:02:26.340> it<00:02:26.520> goes

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:29.310 
all the way down to their into a compact

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:33.650 
all the way down to their into a compact
T<00:02:29.670> flip-flop<00:02:30.239> Thank<00:02:31.200> You<00:02:31.380> Lachlan<00:02:31.890> I<00:02:32.239> and<00:02:33.239> it

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:33.660 
T flip-flop Thank You Lachlan I and it

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:39.470 
T flip-flop Thank You Lachlan I and it
goes<00:02:33.900> over<00:02:34.380> to<00:02:35.280> here<00:02:36.530> not<00:02:37.530> a<00:02:37.560> lot<00:02:37.920> excited<00:02:38.480> over

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:39.480 
goes over to here not a lot excited over

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:40.640 
goes over to here not a lot excited over
to<00:02:39.629> here<00:02:40.019> where<00:02:40.230> they

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:40.650 
to here where they

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.470 
to here where they
it's<00:02:41.099> rigged<00:02:41.519> up<00:02:42.379> and<00:02:43.459> you<00:02:44.459> bring<00:02:44.819> come<00:02:45.180> up<00:02:45.299> to

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480 
it's rigged up and you bring come up to

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.069 
it's rigged up and you bring come up to
here<00:02:45.989> and<00:02:46.970> give<00:02:47.970> the<00:02:48.180> rest<00:02:48.209> to<00:02:48.450> the<00:02:48.629> redstone

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:49.079 
here and give the rest to the redstone

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:54.009 
here and give the rest to the redstone
wire<00:02:49.319> for<00:02:49.530> that<00:02:49.709> a<00:02:51.019> lot<00:02:52.019> of<00:02:52.260> trial<00:02:52.739> and<00:02:52.890> error

00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:54.019 
wire for that a lot of trial and error

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:59.440 
wire for that a lot of trial and error
just<00:02:55.019> tell<00:02:55.260> you<00:02:55.379> that<00:02:55.620> much<00:02:55.829> I<00:02:58.430> want

00:02:59.440 --> 00:02:59.450 
just tell you that much I want

00:02:59.450 --> 00:03:02.750 
just tell you that much I want
eventually<00:03:00.450> I'm<00:03:00.540> going<00:03:00.659> to<00:03:00.720> add<00:03:01.489> piston<00:03:02.489> doors

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:02.760 
eventually I'm going to add piston doors

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.399 
eventually I'm going to add piston doors
to<00:03:03.150> buy<00:03:03.299> 22<00:03:03.840> piston<00:03:04.260> doors<00:03:04.500> right<00:03:04.739> here<00:03:04.769> but

00:03:06.399 --> 00:03:06.409 
to buy 22 piston doors right here but

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:10.160 
to buy 22 piston doors right here but
since<00:03:07.409> I've<00:03:07.620> already<00:03:07.859> ein<00:03:08.549> all<00:03:09.299> this<00:03:09.900> wire

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
since I've already ein all this wire

00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.819 
since I've already ein all this wire
it's<00:03:10.680> really<00:03:11.459> hard<00:03:11.700> to<00:03:11.909> get<00:03:12.359> them<00:03:13.109> not<00:03:13.440> to

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:13.829 
it's really hard to get them not to

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:16.759 
it's really hard to get them not to
intersect<00:03:14.700> and<00:03:15.450> one<00:03:15.840> of<00:03:15.959> the<00:03:16.049> best<00:03:16.260> ways<00:03:16.379> to<00:03:16.500> do

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:16.769 
intersect and one of the best ways to do

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:18.530 
intersect and one of the best ways to do
it<00:03:16.920> is<00:03:16.980> using<00:03:17.340> the<00:03:17.459> block<00:03:17.700> right<00:03:17.730> here<00:03:17.970> because

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:18.540 
it is using the block right here because

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.619 
it is using the block right here because
I<00:03:18.780> take<00:03:19.260> that<00:03:19.470> block<00:03:19.680> away<00:03:19.920> those<00:03:20.819> to<00:03:21.180> connect

00:03:21.619 --> 00:03:21.629 
I take that block away those to connect

00:03:21.629 --> 00:03:25.160 
I take that block away those to connect
and<00:03:21.930> then<00:03:22.260> it<00:03:22.409> won't<00:03:22.620> work<00:03:23.180> so<00:03:24.180> we<00:03:24.870> just<00:03:25.079> put

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:25.170 
and then it won't work so we just put

00:03:25.170 --> 00:03:30.050 
and then it won't work so we just put
that<00:03:25.349> there<00:03:25.560> and<00:03:26.090> they're<00:03:27.090> unconnected<00:03:28.430> but<00:03:29.430> I

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:30.060 
that there and they're unconnected but I

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.770 
that there and they're unconnected but I
mean<00:03:30.689> odd<00:03:31.500> places<00:03:31.859> it's<00:03:32.250> not<00:03:32.459> that<00:03:32.639> easy<00:03:32.819> i'd

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:33.780 
mean odd places it's not that easy i'd

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.800 
mean odd places it's not that easy i'd
have<00:03:33.989> to<00:03:34.019> put<00:03:34.379> the<00:03:34.409> doors<00:03:35.400> right<00:03:35.730> above<00:03:36.359> this<00:03:36.599> i

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
have to put the doors right above this i

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.940 
have to put the doors right above this i
believe<00:03:37.760> no<00:03:38.760> don't<00:03:38.909> have<00:03:39.000> to<00:03:39.150> be<00:03:39.269> right<00:03:39.950> there

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:40.950 
believe no don't have to be right there

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:47.900 
believe no don't have to be right there
and<00:03:41.189> there<00:03:41.540> put<00:03:42.540> the<00:03:42.659> doors<00:03:46.370> yeah<00:03:47.370> i<00:03:47.400> might<00:03:47.730> do

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:47.910 
and there put the doors yeah i might do

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:51.650 
and there put the doors yeah i might do
that<00:03:47.940> sometime<00:03:49.129> but<00:03:50.129> for<00:03:50.310> the<00:03:50.400> time<00:03:50.579> being<00:03:50.660> I'm

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:51.660
